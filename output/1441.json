Up\nachieves this feat perhaps more completely than any other Pixar film. It\u2019s\nalmost as if it contains two different\nfilms woven together. I think this film\nwill remind any honest student viewer\nof something we\u2019ve somehow lost since\nchildhood, and regretfully so.\nUp riskily delays the start of the main\nstory, its introduction instead forming\na biography of the elderly protagonist,\nCarl Fredricksen. In just a few min-utes, we witness him meet and marry\nhis wife, make plans for adventure\nwith her, and eventually lose her at the\nbrink of living their dream. This largely\ndialogue-free sequence is utterly en-thralling, filled with emotional ups and\ndowns yet punctuated with humour,\nand not the kind that only appeals to\nkids. I confess a tear came to my eye\nseveral times. It\u2019s surprising how well\nthe filmmakers handle such a rapid\nprogression through the character\u2019s\nhistory, guiding the audience\u2019s feelings from laughter at slapstick clumsiness to sombre silence after the loss of\na baby. Personally, the film\u2019s opening\ntwenty minutes or so were probably\nmy favourite, but the passage didn\u2019t\noverstay its welcome. By the time we\nare shown old Carl\u2019s ancient house\nswarmed by urban development, we\nhave a close understanding of his personality \u2013 whether we are adults dwelling on his regret over that great missed\nadventure, or kids sympathising with\nhis longing for his lost wife.\nThe bulk of the film is decidedly\nmore mirthful, but it doesn\u2019t lose its\nemotional poignancy. Indeed, this\npoignancy is needed to keep mature\nviewers interested \u2013 even I baulked a\nlittle at the sudden plunge in realism\nwhen ten thousand balloons exploded\nfrom the little house and it surged into\nthe air. Carl\u2019s journey to Paradise Falls\nwith his over-eager assistant, Russell,\nis the central object of the story, and\nit\u2019s a surreal one to say the least. Fortunately, the animation and environmental stylisation is stunning, providing\nrelief for those who might be bored by\nthe sometimes immature plot. Interestingly, the primary setting is rooted\nin reality: Venezuela\u2019s \u201ctepui\u201d or table-top mountains and the famous Angel\nFalls. References to The Lost World\nabound. The pair trek over a dreamlike landscape of windworn rock and\nwild jungle while pulling the floating\nhouse behind, until getting embroiled\nin all kinds of peripheral trouble and,\nof course, action scenes.\nThe supporting characters are engaging if not particularly empathetic.\nCertainly, their parts in the story serve\nto entertain younger viewers more\nthan us grown-ups. The iridescent\nbird, Kevin, provides mainly physical\nhumour, serving for a fair few laughs,\nand the legions of semi-talking dogs\nEliot Barford\nEliot Barford garnered considerable giggles. The\nforemost canine character, Doug, benefits from an adorably hilarious vocal\nperformance. In particular his line, \u201cI\nhave just met you and I love you,\u201d is\nabsolutely life-affirming. The animals\u2019\nstories provide the basis for the rest of\nthe film\u2019s events and some quite thrilling chases and dogfights (both meanings intended).\nHowever, at the end of the day, it\u2019s the\ngrowing relationship between the two\nleads that keeps older viewers hooked\nand that leaves you with a warm feeling after the credits. As Russell\u2019s enthusiasm for exploration reminds Carl\nof his childhood ambitions, so director Pete Docter makes us recall the\nfantasies that were our own comforts\nwhen we were young. Rarely do films\nmarketed towards children have this\nkind of emotional depth, and I haven\u2019t\neven mentioned the subtle allusions to\nRussell\u2019s relationship with his father. I\nhighly recommend this movie, even to\nthose who typically regard such main-stream, childish fare with scepticism;\nyou\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\nChanging the nature\nof investment\nInnovative, thoughtful, successful.\nGrow your career with a global leader\nin alternative investments.\nGraduate opportunities in London and Switzerland\nWe use our market expertise to create innovative, successful products \u2013 which lead to returns for our investors\nand growth for our business.

With three seats\non Council we have the power to\nmake serious changes, but only if we\nare proactive and strive for the recognition we deserve. I don\u2019t pretend I\ncould make huge changes overnight or\nrevolutionise the Union, but what I can\ngive is fair, honest and dedicated representation coupled with the necessary\nexperience.

Front cover photo by Layton Thompson.\nT\nhe first ever Freshers\u2019 Festival\nWeekender severely struggled to attract the crowds\nprojected for an event of its\nsize last weekend.\nEven after all entry charges were\nwaived and drinks were set at Sports\nNight prices, the festival held in Beit\nQuad came close to being empty at\nseveral points throughout its three day\nduration. Original ticket prices were\n\u00a315 for all three days of the weekend,\nwhilst entry to a single day\u2019s proceedings cost \u00a37.50. However, after a poor\nturnout on Friday, the first day, the remaining two were made free of charge.\nThe organisers hoped the cheap\ndrinks would help pull in more peo-ple, but the \u00a31.50 pints seemed to\ndo little for the crowd numbers, and\none attendee described the place as\n\u201cdeserted\u201d.\nDespite the impressive line-up, the\nUnion\u2019s chronic problem of poor student turnout to its events lay injury to\nweekend festival. Reports on Saturday\nand Sunday night approximate a maximum crowd number of around 140\npeople.\nIC Radio Station Manager and festival organiser Dan Fowler felt the festival was a reaction to student\u2019s boredom of previous Union events.\n\u201cHow many times have you been sat\non the small wall outside DaVinci\u2019s and\nover heard some drunken fool moaning that \u2018This place only puts on drum\nand bass nights?\u2019\nWell the aim of this event was to\nchange that mentality. I\u2019m just looking\nthrough the set timetable now\u2026house,\nindie, metal, rock, electro, acoustic,\npop, hip hop/jazz \u2013 for me, this aim\nwas achieved to the highest standard.\u201d\nChew Lips, releasing their material\nwith Kitsune Records and arguably the\nband with the biggest reputation at the\nFreshers\u2019 Festival fails to attract Freshers. Or anyone\nJust what went wrong? Dan Wan reports on the Freshers\u2019 Festival Weekender 2009 and its miserable turnout\nfestival, headlined Saturday night in\nwhich was described as the \u201cbiggest\u201d\nday of the three. Their disappointment\nat the small audience was evident and\nFowler himself was let down by the\nband\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cThey have also fallen into the trap of\nthinking they are a lot bigger than they\nare and so sulked through the entire\nperformance on the night when seeing\nthe small crowd. Fair enough, it wasn\u2019t\ngreat, however when you\u2019re being paid\nyou\u2019ve got no excuses to not just go out\nand do what you do best.\u201d\nThe Freshers\u2019 Festival was the brainchild of members of ICRadio, Imperial\u2019s budding radio station. With fruitful contacts, and dedicated organisers,\nthe event looked to be a resounding\nsuccess. Impressive initial artwork for\npublicity attracted several other societies at Imperial to give their backing,\nincluding Jazz and Rock, Photo Soc,\nfelix and especially DramSoc. The failure to lure in punters comes as a sur-prise, as the manpower and collaboration behind the weekend should have\nmeant a packed Beit Quad all weekend.\nAs part of Union President Ashley\nBrown\u2019s manifesto, he pledged that\nmore live music and entertainment\nwould happen at the Union; the Freshers\u2019 Festival certainly provided this. Despite being a society organised event,\nthe Union backed the event financially\nand administratively. Three of the major acts were said to have been booked\nthrough Union contacts, and money\nfor advertising and publicity were pro-vided. The timing of the event could\nalso have been the root cause of the\nweekend\u2019s problems. Occurring only\ntwo weeks into the new academic year\nmeant the spread of publicity for an\nevent of its size and duration was limited on campus and by word-of-mouth.\nPosters for the event were only seen\naround campus approximately a week\nbefore the event, and this was clearly\nnot enough time for them to have any\neffect on the student population. Mr\nFowler was happy to admit mistakes\nwere made, but suggested that more of\nthe blame laid elsewhere.\n\u201cMaybe the event started too early,\nmaybe the pricing was wrong \u2013 these\nare all lessons that can be learned.\nHowever, if we want a Union to be\nproud we need to support it and events\nlike this which are flagship and trailblazing occasions for Imperial.\u201d\nWhere the blame actually lies will\nbe debated in the coming weeks, and\nthe errors made are to be learnt from\nif the Freshers\u2019 Festival is set up again\nnext year.\nIt comes as a great shame to many\npeople across the Union; from the societies involved to the Union\u2019s entertainments team. Both of whom could have\nbenefited majorly from the boost in\nreputation the Freshers\u2019 Festival could\nhave provided.\nFestival-goer and Fresher, Alex Karapetian, gave his honest and fitting\nopinion after initial bewilderment at\nthe emptiness of the event.\n\u201c[The festival] gets 2/5 in my opinion\u00ac because of the overall sufficiency\nof the bands and the good work of the\nICRadio DJs. The greatest limiting factor here was that we didn\u2019t have anywhere near the amount of people needed to be able to fully enjoy ourselves.\u201d\nThe Ghostcat lead singer, Ali Cat, is so overwhelmed by the Freshers\u2019 Festival she collapses on stage (left), whilst the meagre crowd stare at the ceiling or floor (right)\n\n"

Pop music master here\nsuggests that we shouldn\u2019t review pop\nmusic as we clearly all hate pop music\nhere at the felix, but this isn\u2019t true! I\nlove pop music.\nI like David Bowie, Michael Jackson,\nLa Roux, Weezer, and so on. We try\nto cover a range of different music and\nif you want something else in here, go\nahead and write it and send it in.\nSomeone else I spoke to recently,\nwhen asked what sort of music he listens to replied that all music is either\nclassical or pop, and if it isn\u2019t classical,\nthen it\u2019s just pop music. I think there\u2019s\ntruth in this, while I love to categorise\nand dissect music into boxes, it occurs\nto me: there is no definition of pop\nmusic. Pop obviously just stands for\n\u2018popular\u2019, and the music that we think\nof as modern pop music really just\nmeans it is music made to be popular,\ni.e. to sell records. And this is why I\ndon\u2019t like the Saturdays. It\u2019s made to\nappeal to the most easily manipulated\nand easily influenced corner of the\nmarket, the real low-brow, microwave-dinner eating, George-by-Asda wear-ing, X-factor voting, Sun reading cre-tins. Urgh.\nSo, here are some things I like (yes!\nThere actually are things I like!), that\nI bought recently and recommend\nyou getting into. ZE 30: ZE Records\nStory 1979 \u2013 2009 is a compilation of\nartists on the New York record label\nthat includes an eclectic mix of post-punk misfits and music ranging from\ndisco (Material with Nona Hendrix\n- Bustin\u2019 out), calypso (Kid Creole &\nthe Coconuts \u2013 something wrong in\nparadise), no wave (Suicide \u2013 dream\ndream baby), and off-beat Jazz weirdness (James Chance and the Contortions \u2013 roving eye).\nGang Gang Dance \u2013 Saint Dymphna is an album that came out in 2008\nbut I only just got round to buying it\nrecently because the sticker said \u201cFact\nMagazine names it the best album\nwe\u2019ve heard all year!\u201d and I like Fact\nmagazine. It\u2019s a weird and twisting mix\nof ethereal electronic and worldbeat. I\ncan only think to describe it as exciting\nand magical and weirder than Bjork\nand Animal Collective together. The\ntrack \u201cHouse Jam\u201d is probably one of\nthe best songs I\u2019ve ever heard.\nGirls \u2013 Album is lovely, fuzzy, indie pop gold. Who can\u2019t relate to\nopening lyrics like \u201cOh I wish I had a\nboyfriend/a sun tan/a pizza/a bottle of\nwine\u201d? I love the whole album. The\nlead singer was brought up in the Children Of God cult, where his brother\ndied due to lack of medical care and his\nmum became a prostitute. He left at\nthe age of 16 and ran away to become\na stoner in Texas living with million-aires. Woah, that\u2019s pretty crazy.\nAlex Ashford\nAlex Ashford Music Editor\nReviews\nThe electronic beats on Autokratz\u2019s debut album, are fairly repetitive and get\non your nerves after a while. But the\nvocals by David make the songs ever so\nslightly catchy and are strong enough\nto get you dancing along. Similar to\nHot Chip this is music you might listen\nto, to get into the party mood. - Holly\nCumbers\nAUTOKRATZ\nANIMAL\nKITSUNE\nThis is some kind of acoustic punk/\nemo. I\u2019ve just listened to it and I\u2019ve\nalready forgotten what it sounds like.\nI think it was alright. If you like folk\npunk sort of stuff you could do worse\nthan this.- Alex Ashford\nALBUM\nFRANK TURNER\nPOETRY OF THE\nDEED\nXTRA MILE/\nEPITAPH\nSINGLE\nFuneral for a Friend\nKoko, Camden\n14th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nF\nor most people, the name \u201cFuneral for a Friend\u201d evokes the\nterm \u201cemo\u201d; perhaps a rather\nglum association. I too had\ndismissed them as bland fad-followers\nbefore a chance run-in with their debut\nalbum, Casually Dressed and Deep in\nConversation, and I would encourage\nwary listeners to shed their prejudices\ntoo \u2013 you might be pleasantly surprised.\nDespite the fact that Wednesday\u2019s\ngig was on Matt Davies-Kreye\u2019s (vo-cals) birthday, their current tour itself\nis something of a celebration for the\nband. They just released a best of al-bum, and a sense of awe at the act\u2019s\nsurvival over seven-and-a-half years\nwas conveyed in the birthday boy\u2019s\nlight-hearted between-song banter.\nKOKO was sold out and the rapport\nbetween the band and audience was\nstrong yet relaxed, almost relieved.\nThis couldn\u2019t be said for the support\nacts, Telegraphs (emo-tinged \u201calternative rock\u201d) and Save Your Breath\n(emo-tinged pop punk), whose good\nsets to a floor, mostly empty thanks to\nsix wasted manly men and one mental (and more than inebriated) scene\ngirl. Thankfully, the fervent crowd\nswamped their disruptions well before\nthe main act came on.\nFor this tour the band allowed fans to\nvote for their favourite songs and from\nthe results they created their setlists.\nThis meant that everyone\u2019s dream\nselection was played, and the energy\ndidn\u2019t let up for a minute. By far the\nlargest track contribution came from\ntheir first album with choice cuts from\nall three others, including the moving\n\u201cHistory\u201d and grandiose though slightly sickly \u201cInto Oblivion (Reunion)\u201d.\nOne of the band\u2019s greatest strengths\nis their talent for writing gargantuan\nchoruses, a force only magnified live.\nDavies-Kreye hardly needed to sing\nhis own songs, and even Kris CoombsRoberts and Darran Smith\u2019s intensely\nmelodic guitar hooks were overcome\nby the crowd\u2019s voice at times. For my-self, I didn\u2019t realise how far forward I\nhad moved until the lights went up,\nand my voice hurt from trying to sing\nover all the other fans. My only complaint would be that obligatory closer\n\u201cJuneau\u201d, felt almost anticlimactic after\nFuneral\u2019s voted-for gigs a winner\nEliot Barford drops his prejudices and gets a bit emotional\nThis song is about three minutes too\nlong. The whole thing just reminds\nme of the sloppy shit I took the other\nday when I ate too much lentil curry.\nThey\u2019re touring with The Enemy, so if\nyou like them this\u2019ll be a wet dream for\nyou. - Barnaby Walker\nGENERAL\nFIASCO\nWE ARE THE\nFOOLISH\nINFECTIOUS\nSINGLE\nHed Kandi claim that \u2018Destroy the\nDisco\u2019 is \u201creaching into the future\u201d.\nIt\u2019s quite a lofty claim, and one that\nthis 2-CD mix falls far short of, but I\nwouldn\u2019t hold that against it. The first\nCD is full of remixes that you can see\ncoming from a mile away. There\u2019s a reworked track by Gossip, one by Block\nParty and one by Calvin Harris \u2013 you\nget the picture. CD2 is less packed with\npredictable remixes, but still offers little respite from the formulaic bass-heavy electro clich\u00e9s.\nAlthough there are a few highlights,\nincluding a remix from Kissy Sell Out\nthat transforms a Noisettes track into\nan absolute leviathan, overall there\u2019s\nnothing that stands out here really. For\na mix that runs the length of two CDs,\nit\u2019s not really worth the time it takes to\nlisten to it.

A\ntighter, more disciplined effort than a\nnumber of their recent releases, Got\nSome alludes to the McCarthyism of\nthe tail end of the Bush maladministra-tion; Just Breathe is a quietly moving\nromantic masterpiece on the acoustic\nguitar and Hammond organ, leaning in\nplaces on the acoustic folk of the early\n\u201870s.\nIt\u2019s long been accepted that Pearl\nJam would have eclipsed Nirvana completely had Eddie Vedder taken the\nsensible career move of developing a\nheroin addiction and topping himself.\nAs the band\u2019s sound continues to de-velop, though, I find myself more and\nmore glad he didn\u2019t.\n- Duncan Casey\nPEARL JAM\nGOT SOME &\nJUST BREATHE\nMONKEY\nWRENCH\nSINGLE\nThis guy looks a lot like Moby, and\nsings with the same kind of melancholy self-obsession. Maybe it is Moby\u2019s alter-ego? It\u2019s unlikely because\nthis is actually pretty good. It\u2019s quiet\nand haunting and more than a little bit\ncomforting, in the same way that Elliot\nSmith songs are. - Alex Ashford\nRICHARD\nWALTERS\nTHE ANIMAL\nKARTEL\nALBUM\nThis take on Alan Vega\u2019s original from\nLCD Soundsystem is a straightfor-ward, slow build romp in the same\nvein as \u2018All My Friends\u2019 off their 2007\nalbum. Groovy bass lines and cool, airy\nvocals make it pretty listenable, but\nit is lacking in the vivacity of classic\ntracks such as \u2018North American Scum\u2019.\n- Michael Inkpen\nLCD\nSOUNDSYSTEM\nBYE BYE BAYOU\nDFA\nSINGLE\nThe upbeat acoustic guitar and occasional clever samples disguise a range\nof bleaker topics than is apparent on\nfirst inspection. His lo-fi approach and\nsinging voice, is reminiscent of artists\nlike Badly Drawn Boy. This is small-venue, intimate stuff; the music would\nfeel out of place in on a big stage, (ex-cept Glastonbury, at least), somewhere\nlike the Troubadour - it could be really\nspecial. - Duncan Casey\nTIMOTHY J\nSIMPSON\nOUR GLORIOUS\nHERO BATTLES\nTHE MAN\nALBUM\na set of songs of such consistent and\nperhaps superior quality.\nFuneral for a Friend are hard to recommend to anyone with decent musical taste, but with so many anthems I\npromise you their live show is a fulfilling experience.\n\n"

After years of\napplying for jobs, I\u2019m back. 2004 was a\nbad year, lads. After being caught on-air being \u2018racist\u2019, no one would employ\nme. For the last five years, I\u2019ve been\nfilming a series of Angolan adverts for\nvarious products. They love a bit casual racism I reckon.\nAnyway, I\u2019m back in the limelight; the\nBritish limelight. See the fellas above?\nRubbish. They\u2019re all thick, lazy.......peo-ple. I swear that description has got me\ninto trouble before. Who cares any-way? I\u2019ve managed footballing giants\nsuch as Kettering Town, West Bromich\nAlbion and Aston fucking Villa. Aston\nfucking Villa!\nBig Ron would do a much better job\non Union Council. Engineering? I\u2019ve\nengineered Division 4-winning teams.\nMedics? I once fucking played in my\nshort and unsucessful career with a\nbroken ankle for 82 minutes. Who\nneeds Medics? Sciences? Pah, all these\nmodern managers these days using\nfood science to get their players fit and\nhealthy. I forced all my players to eat a\nhearty meal of dirt and porridge, with\na side serving of casual racism. Look\nwhere it got me! Unemployed! Desperate for media work! RON!

If elected,\nI thus promise to remain representa-tive, open and accountable. I commit\nto seek out and represent *your* views\nand make sure that they are heard and\nresponded to. At my previous uni-versity, I was college union president,\nmember of the student council and director of the university paper.

    "content": "unionpage\nWith the economy in the state that it is,\nwe\u2019re told it\u2019s now the case that where there\nwere 5 people vying for one job there\u2019s\nnow 10, or something to that effect. The\ngreat thing about going to Imperial and\nworking for a good degree is that you\u2019ve\nalready improved your chances in those\n10. However, the Imperial stereotype (you\nknow the one I mean) that many amongst us\nadmittedly adhere to can sometimes counter\nthat advantage leaving us back where we\nstarted.\nWith the impending Olympics you can\u2019t\nhelp but feel that it has breathed some new\nlife into London, with a renewed sense of\npurpose being given to many aspects; not\njust sport. So it\u2019s lucky for us that we not\nonly happen to be pretty clever but also in\nLondon enveloped in this atmosphere, to\ntake advantage of this.\nIn recognition of this, a new initiative has\nbeen launched called CV2012; a joint effort\nfrom Imperial College Union, the Careers\nService, the Volunteer Centre and Sport\nImperial. \u2018What\u2019s this about?\u2019 I hear you\nask. It\u2019s a way of getting recognition, nay,\nan award for all the extra that you do with\nyour time here at Imperial, that gives you\na noticeable and exciting edge on the\ncompetition. The other cool thing about it\nis that it is yours to make of what ever you\nwant to gain from it.\nIt\u2019s made up of a points based system,\nworking towards getting 50 points. To\nhelp you get started, just turning up to the\ninduction gets you well on your way with\n5 points- after all, its worth knowing what\nyou are getting yourself in for. The biggest\ncomponent is the activity that you do which\nis 30 points for 30 hours of your time. This\nshould have an element of outreach or\nvolunteering to it, but this is also where\nthe Volunteer Centre is able to help you\nout. With over 40 different categories of\nvolunteering there is definitely something\nfor everyone; whether you\u2019re a die-heart\ngardener and want to help spruce up some\nof the city\u2019s green spaces, or want to help\nrehabilitate prisoners you\u2019re able to give back\nto the community, which is something that a\nlot of potential employers love to see.\nAlternatively, if you are more inclined towards\nsport, Sport Imperial have created a unique\nopportunity to work towards the Sport\nLeader\u2019s award. This is something that you\nwould normally have to shell out a fair few\nquid for, but being nice as they are have\ndecided to cover the cost of your award. This\naward, while called \u2018Sport Leaders\u2019 really\naims to develop a host of transferable skills\nthrough the medium of sport, for example:\nbeing resourceful and thinking on your toes,\nor performing in high pressure situations.\nYou\u2019re able to do your outreach element as\nit involves going into schools and working\nwith secondary school children. To do this\naward you don\u2019t have to be outstanding at\nsport yourself, in fact being able to throw and\ncatch isn\u2019t even a prerequisite. All you need\nis enthusiasm!\nOn top of this, there are 5 points for going to\na session with the Careers service, and this\nis probably the bit which helps you the most\nto transfer those skills that you inadvertently\nlearn by doing your activity, into attributes\nthat you can really sell effectively come\napplication and interview time. The Careers\nService have a whole range of sessions to\nhelp you from a 20 minute mock interview\nto a 2 day insight into management. You\ncan do this session at any point during the\nprogramme though, again being totally\nflexible to fit around everything else that you\nhave to do.\nTo finish up there is a verification and\nan assessment, but these are short and\npainless! After all, since you\u2019ve done the\nwork this is your time to shine and report\nback on all the good work you\u2019ve done to\npick up a further 5 points for each. And there\nyou have it; five easy steps to enhancing\nyour CV to help make you the first choice\nwhen you\u2019re competing against 9 others for\nyour dream job.\nNow all there is left to say is when the next\ninduction is so that you can get started with\nthe award. This is being held at 4.30pm on\nMonday 26th October in SALC 5 (on the 5th\nfloor of Sherfield). If you can\u2019t make these or\nwant any more info check out\nwww.ic.ac.uk/2012\nor email cv2012@ic.ac.uk.\nCV2012\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nJennyWilson\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) dpcs@imperial.ac.uk\nTrials to be part of the team for University\nChallenge 2010 are taking place early in\nNovember.\nIn light of the recent success of Imperial\non the show BBC TV quiz show University\nChallenge we are now selecting the team to\ntake part in the show in 2010. We are looking\nfor a team of four with an additional reserve\nmember, who have not competed on the\nshow before.\nApplicants must be current students (either\nundergraduate or postgraduate) and expect\nto be still a student in April 2010.\nTrials will take place in the Read lecture\ntheatre on Level 5 of the Sherfield Building at\n1800 on the 2nd and the 5th of November.\nNo need to book, just turn up!\nUniversity Challenge 2010\n\n"

    "content": "23\nfelix FRIDAY 23 OCTOBER 2009\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\nThe old-school puppets are startlingly full of vitality on screen thanks to a cast that is as varied as the animal characters that appear in the film\nBFI film festival off to a surprising start\nIf George Clooney only ever lends\nhis voice to one animated family film,\nhe\u2019s chosen well. Perfectly cast as the\nsuper-suave Mr. Fox in this retelling of\nRoald Dahl\u2019s Fantastic Mr Fox, the film\nsees him face off against a trio of farmers seeking revenge for his thievery\n(for those unfamiliar with the story:\nthink Ocean\u2019s Eleven, if Danny Ocean\nwas a fox living in rural England).\nWednesday 14th October marked\nthe opening of the BFI\u2019s 53rd annual\nLondon Film Festival, which runs until\nthe 29th, and kicked off spectacularly\nwith the world premiere of Fantastic Mr. Fox, as transposed in the style\nof Wes Anderson and his usual band\nof collaborators. Jason Schwartzman\nvoices Fox\u2019s frustrated son, Ash, determined to prove himself after the\narrival of his overachieving cousin and\nBill Murray takes his turn as Badger,\nMr. Fox\u2019s woodland lawyer, obviously.\nLed by Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, and\nClooney as walkman-wearing, trade-mark-whistling Mr. Fox, Anderson\nmakes his mark.\nStill, even with Wes Anderson\u2019s fingerprints all over the film, it retains\nthe heart of a Roald Dahl story \u2013 the\nwry humour, the darker twists, the irrepressible Britishness of it all. This\nlatter quality was all the more impres-sive, considering the largely American\ncast (look out for Willem Dafoe\u2019s unexpected Deep South take on the cider-guarding Rat) but Anderson wisely\ncasts a few key British actors, such as\nBrian Cox and Michael Gambon as the\nfarmers terrorising the local animal\ncommunity, and Jarvis Cocker appears\nevery so often in puppet-form to strum\na few songs on the banjo. Gambon\u2019s\ncharacter in particular is excellent,\nthough this may be also partly due to\nthe impeccable animation.\nOriginally set to be animated by Henry Selick (of Nightmare Before Christmas fame), Selick was forced to drop\nout in favour of directing Coraline. Despite this loss of a great talent, the end\nproduct is probably better off. Animated under the capable direction of Mark\nGustafson, the film is less burdened\nby the three distinctive voices of ani-mator, director and story; instead the\nincredibly well-crafted stop-motion\nanimation provides the perfect vehicle\nfor Anderson and Dahl\u2019s story-telling.\nThe attention paid to the smallest details \u2013 individual hairs that move ac-cordingly, animated tears which swell\nand subside in moments \u2013 are some of\nthe things that really set this film higher than so many other animated films.\nThe contrast between detail and the\njerky animation gives a wonderful cozy\nfeel to the film. Wes Anderson had\nsaid that he\u2019d jumped on the project\nout of deep respect for Roald Dahl,\nand the nod towards this great author\nclearly shows through \u2013 especially in\none touching \u2013 and unmistakably Wes\ndoes not entirely blow you away like\nthe former, this long-awaited screen\nversion of Roald Dahl\u2019s classic is highly\nentertaining, visually beautiful and\ncaptivating. Fantastic Mr. Fox, like\nUp and like what Spike Jonze\u2019s Where\nThe Wild Things Are promises to be\nwhen it comes out this December, further raises the bar for all future family\nfilms. It maintains a strong standard of\nhumour, action and poignancy, making\nit an excellent animation debut from\nauteurist Wes Anderson and a tremendous way to begin BFI\u2019s new season of\nbringing great cinema to London.\nJade Hoffman\nJade Hoffman\nYes, this is definitely an indie movie - just look at those spectacles\nA new \u2018indie\u2019 must-see\nAnderson-created \u2013 scene towards the\nend (\u201cI\u2019m asking him if he thinks we\u2019re\nin for a hard winter\u201d). It\u2019s not for nothing that Dahl\u2019s widow joined the cast\non stage to open this film \u2013 of all the\nRoald Dahl adaptations, this may well\nbe the one that comes closest to preserving his essence.\nThis film has come out right in the\nmiddle of a flurry of truly brilliant\n\u201cfamily films\u201d, all transcending a genre\nthat has become a staple of cinema\nthese days. Following Pixar\u2019s breathtaking Up, it\u2019s difficult to give a full five\nstars to Fantastic Mr. Fox, but whilst it\nThis is not a fairytale. If anything, this\nfilm is refreshingly real. Every year the\nBFI London Film Festival showcases\nthe best in new movies worldwide,\nand Paper Heart, a quirky exploration\nslash faux documentary of that much-attested emotion (love, what else?), is\nboth funny and heart-warming. Not\nheart-warming in the crappy chick-flick ugly-girl-turns-supermodel-lives-happily-ever-after sense, but in a more\ngenuine, relatable, \u2018Hey! This could\nactually happen\u2019 way (quickly followed\nby the \u2018Damn! Why am I single?\u2019 less\nheart-warming, more depressing way).\nAnd despite the fact the word \u2018love\u2019\nis mentioned 78,389 times in the film\n(or thereabouts) it succeeds in never\nreaching that sickening stage where\nyou just want to stab the actors\u2019 eyes\nout. I think even the more masculine\nof felix\u2019s readers would be able to survive to the end of the film. A great deal\nof the charm of this movie is due to its\nhumour. It isn\u2019t what you would expect\nfrom a standard American comedy, it\u2019s\nvery visual, often very subtle, almost \u2013\ndare I say it \u2013 British; think the geeki-ness of The IT Crowd crossed with the\nawkwardness of The Inbetweeners (or\nthe other way around).\nThe film follows Charlyne Yi, who\nplays a fictional version of herself and\nleads the documentary on her quest\nto find out about love, the one subject\nshe just can\u2019t get her head around and\ncan\u2019t bring herself to believe in. Her\ncharacter is surprisingly normal and\nunclich\u00e9d, albeit slightly irritating. For\nonce, the star of a movie isn\u2019t someone\nwho is beautiful in that tired, artificial,\nHollywood kind of way \u2013 not even in a\nhot Asian way.\nMichael Cera also stars, playing his\nusual pants-too-high-and-too-short\nself. He comes into the film as the\ndocumentary takes a turn \u2013 instead of\nfocusing on external stories, it follows\nthe two characters\u2019 blossoming romance (which mirrors their rumoured\noff-screen relationship).\nThrough the second half of the film,\nwe watch the two main characters\ntrying to make a go of things whilst\nstruggling with the strain of being constantly in front of the camera and the\ndifficulties that arise when one person\njust refuses to fall in love.\nIf there\u2019s a criticism to be made it\u2019s\nthat this film screams indie-flick; indie music, indie actors, indie look-at-how-unusual-I-am. Come on, love,\nit\u2019s a film, you could at least put some\nmake-up on. Sure enough, a budget of\n$1 million and a 9 week shooting time\nis impressive for any film these days\nbut there\u2019s no need to make quite so\nmuch of a point of it. Would it have\nkilled them to hold the camera still?\nThat said, inter-cut with stick-puppet\ntheatre scenes and an amalgamation\nof cameos from famous names (Seth\nRogen and David Krumholtz to name\nbut two), the fictional love story sits\nbeautifully between the genuine interviews of real people about their \u2013 often unconventional \u2013 views on love, be\nthey redneck bikers, bar sluts, Las Vegas wedding chapel chaplains (dressed\nas Elvis), or even children. From the\nscientific to the spiritual, all manner\nof real-life views are explored, held\ntogether by this scripted story of two\nawkward, gangly people finding awk-ward, gangly lo- well. Something like\nlove.\nIt\u2019s well worth giving this film a\nchance; it\u2019s not quite a documentary,\nit\u2019s not quite a rom-com, but it\u2019s entertaining to the end. Paper Heart\nshowcases stories from many people\nof varied backgrounds, and if this collection of oddballs can find some form\nof love, hell, there\u2019s even hope for us at\nImperial.\nSabrina Castiglione\nSabrina Castiglione\n\n"

With the crowd in full voice the\ntwo teams set off, level pegging down\nthe whole pitch, finally though Imperial\u2019s consistent hitting began to show\nworking well supporting one another\nas a team and managing to accelerate away from Cambridge in the second half of the pitch to take a narrow\nvictory.\nNot to be outdone, the Novices got\nset up for their first chukka of the day;\nanother grudge match against the Royal Veterinary College. This time round\nmyself, Rosie and Trish knew we were\nagainst opponents we could dominate\nin the chukka and we used every inch\nof advantage we could. Muscling our\nway towards the goal line we scored\nour first, trickling the ball over the line\nin a rather uninspiring m\u00eal\u00e9e of sticks\nand ponies\u2019 legs. A few frustrated fouls\nfrom RVC crept in culminating in one\nplayer getting sucked in to a high hook\nmetres from their goal mouth and\nawarding us the option of a spot hit or\na 30 yard penalty. We took the spot hit\nwithout hesitation and calmly put the\nball between the posts with just a slight\njitter of nerves as it went worryingly\nclose to the near post.\nWith a satisfying 2-0 win under our\nbelts, and the Beginners having a good\nresult too, we were all looking forwards to our last Saturday matches.\nBut perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have been\nso eager. Despite playing visibly their\nbest polo of the tournament so far, the\nbeginners weren\u2019t able to hang onto St\nAndrews and in one of the most physical matches we\u2019ve ever played the Novices lost out 1-0 to Nottingham as well.\nThe good play in both matches left us\nwith plenty of positives though and we\nheaded for the Saturday night party in\nhigh spirits. The girls made good use\nof the chocolate fountain and the guys\n(rather wisely) avoided partaking in\nthe pole dancing lessons that were being given to drunken organisers.\nFortunately this year we didn\u2019t have\nto be up at 9am on Sunday and so\nthose of us that were feeling slightly\nthe worse for wear had plenty of time\nto recover before their final chukkas of\nthe tournament. The Beginners were\nup first; the fight for 11th and 12th\nplace against Royal Holloway. Again\nthey played some of their best polo\nof the tournament, both teams far\nmore flowing than their initial scrappy\nchukkas, but again the hunt for a goal\nproved fruitless and a slightly disappointing 0-0 draw and narrow loss on\nthe tiebreaker.\nConversely it felt like the Novices\nwere getting even more physical and\nfast in their 7th-8th playoff against\nOxford Brookes. After a series of ride-offs, hooks and big defensive shots\nthough a slight miscommunication put\nRosie in an impossible 2 on 1 in front\nof the goal mouth and despite covering\noff one of the opponents she was unable to do anything to stop the easy tap\nin that put Oxford Brookes 1-0 up. Play\ncontinued from the centre and finally\nwe looked to be starting to hold our\nown, one big hit and we looked to be in\nwith a break that might turn the tide,\nbut the air horn ironically chose that\nmoment to sound and play finished to\nthe anguished cries of Imperial supporters from the sidelines, wanting to\nsee the result of the final play.\nWith only one win a piece and the\nhunt for a goal in the beginners coming\nup short for the Beginners it wasn\u2019t the\nresult we had wanted, but we all went\nhome happy, if rather tired and sunburnt and in some cases really rather\nsick of sleeping in tents. We\u2019d shown\na lot of improvement since last year\nand were now holding our own against\nsome of the tougher teams in the competition and there are high hopes that\nthis year, with some fresh blood and\nsome familiar faces, we might go even\nfurther.\nContinued From Back Page\nImperial College Riding and Polo Club doing what they do best in Bury\n\n"

And there\u2019s\nnot that much going on at the Union\nat the moment so we\u2019re not quite sure\nwhat to do with ourselves around London, right?\nYou\u2019ve been told about Vodka Island\nat Tiger Tiger and OnAnon and no\ndoubt you\u2019ve all been to Cheapskates\nby now, but we can probably do without them most of the time. Don\u2019t get\nme wrong, all of those nights (mostly\nrun by a company called Rough Hill \u2013\ncheck their website if you\u2019re into that\nkind of thing) can be a good night out,\nexcept you have to get stupidly drunk\nand/or dressed up like an idiot to have\nfun and fit in at those places. But London has so much more!\nI thought I\u2019d put together a few of\nmy favourite clubs and bars around\nLondon for you to see what you think.\nAlso, for when you\u2019re just in the mood\nto go out but you\u2019re not sure what you\nfancy \u2013 Time Out London is a brilliant\nwebsite for club listings.\nOtherwise, check felix every week\nand we should have some things to interest you!\nKoKo is probably the one club in Camden that everybody has heard of. With\nits dramatic, theatre-style interior and\nbands playing every week, KoKo can\nbe a great place to spend your Friday\nnights. Although the impression of\ngrandeur created by the decor can also\nbe reflected in the drinks prices (and\nthe taxi price if you can\u2019t handle the bus\nhome), Club NME is the closest thing\nKoKo has to a real \u2018student night\u2019. They\nhave a pretty wide range of live bands\nplaying at KoKo, although the majority\nfit quite nicely into the \u2018indie\u2019 bracket.\nThis Friday 23rd they have Bleach, The\nDrums playing as live bands, and they\nalways have a couple of DJs on afterwards - this week there\u2019s a DJ set from\nOu Est Le Swimming Pool and Brainlove Records!\nYou\u2019ve all finished with Freshers\u2019 Week, and now nobody knows\nwhat to do, right? Wrong. Well, Charlotte Morris does anyway\nA blast to the past,\nwith roller-skates!\n3 am on a night bus, your eyelids are\nheavy and you are sure you just sat on\nsome fresh chewing gum conveniently\nplaced on the seat by the last passen-ger. It\u2019s been your 3rd night at Tiger Tiger that month and as your best mate\nslumps across your chest murmuring\nsomething about On Anon on Thursday you think: \u201cIs this the only nightlife\nLondon has to offer? Terrible music,\nvomit inducing drinks deals and sticky\nfloors, can there be something different?\u201d If this has ever run through your\nhead during a moment of impending\nsobriety then let me introduce you to\nRenaissance Rooms.\nLocated in Vauxhall, this club contains a perfectly reconstructed 70\u2019s\nstyle Roller Disco! Leg-warmers and\nspandex are a must for this fun and\nenergetic night out. The interior of the\nclub is simple with a two tier skate rink\nin the centre and two bars lining each\nside. The music is naturally Motown,\nfunk and other 70\u2019s classics mixed\nin with some early house and a few\nmodern chart hits. Don\u2019t worry if this\ndoesn\u2019t sound like your style though,\nonce you slip your neon tights into the\nskates, you feel immediately transported back 30 years and you will soon be\nshowing your skills on the dance floor.\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t skate!\u201d I hear you scream.\nThis is not a major problem, roller skating is similar to ice skating but much\nsimpler and only after half an hour you\nshould soon it pick up enough to have\na good time. The protocol on the skating rink/dance floor is again similar to\nClub NME @ KoKo\nMornington Cresent\nFridays, \u00a35, \u00a34 NUS before\nmidnight\nBite @ Punk\nTottenham Court Road\nFridays, \u00a35, \u00a33 NUS/flyer\nAnother one of my favourite indie\nhaunts, Bite at Punk on a Monday\nis always good fun. Playing all kinds\nof electro-indie and pop, this club is\ntucked away just off Oxford Street. The\nclub itself is quite small (in comparison\nto the others I\u2019ve put together on this\npage). Drinks prices are fairly reason-Matter\nNorth Greenwich\nPrices vary, usually around\n\u00a315\nI had never been to the O2 arena, or\nthe Millenium Dome - far too far\nacross London for not really anything\ninteresting. Matter is worth it. Its actually quite fun to have a stroll alongside the Thames as the sun comes up at\n6am, as you\u2019re on the way to the Tube\nstation to get the train with those very\ndisapproving commuters.\nThey have different events throughout the year - they even had a Freshers\u2019\nevent where Faithless did a live set.\nThe next big thing not to be missed\nat matter is Hospitality on 6th November, with acts including High Contrast,\nLondon Elektricity and Beardyman (if\nyou get a chance to see Beardymanhe\u2019s awesome, we saw him at Bestival!!).\nSee their website for more details, but\nbasically they have the best events for\ndrum & bass, house and techno. They\nrun alongside the well-known club\nFabric in organising freshers\u2019 events so\nlook out for them, especially if you live\nin halls!!\nable on a Monday night, personally I\nwouldn\u2019t like to pay the entry price and\ndrinks prices for the other nights that\nPunk put on!!\nThis night is run by the same people\nwho put on a similar night at King\u2019s\nCollege Union, called After Skool\nClub. On a Saturday night it\u2019s \u00a37 entry\nand supposedly a pretty good night!\nI guess you can see from the clubs\nI\u2019ve chosen to tell you about, that my\nmusic taste lies between indie-electro\nand drum & bass, but don\u2019t let that\nput you off. There are plenty of clubs\naround London which cater for different genres of music. I\u2019ve been to a night\ncalled Voodoo which moves around to\ndifferent clubs (when I went it was at\nElectrowerks, Angel) and they play\nmostly metal, punk and ska - always\na good night out, playing everything\nfrom Alexisonfire to Nine Inch Nails\nto The Specials.\nAnd there are plenty of nights out\naround Camden that play that kind\nof music. Purple Turtle in Camden is\na good one for live music and Underworld generally plays rock music (albe-it a bit cheesy) along with some indie\nand some metal.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a particularly\ncheap night out, head to Shoreditch,\nwhere places usually allow free entry.\nDrinks prices usually compensate for\nthis but you don\u2019t have to get \u2018smashed\u2019.\nClubs to look out for in Shoreditch include Electricity Showrooms, Hoxton\nPony and T-bar, which are all around\nOld Street and Liverpool Street. Most\nof these places also finish quite early\n(around 1-2am) so, although there\nusually is dancing, they probably fall in\nthe \u2018bar\u2019 category as opposed to \u2018clubs\u2019.\nThey\u2019re also generally better to go to\non a weekend!!\nThere are always the \u2018gay nights\u2019 too\n- Popstarz at The Den (formerly The\nEnd) and G-A-Y Late, where you can\nsing and dance along to all the cheesiest pop songs, from Girls Aloud to\nBritney!\nEd Knock gets his lycra on and gets rolling\nGet involved!\nSo you\u2019ve read what I\u2019ve got to say, what have you been up to on\nyour nights out around London? Whether it\u2019s a bar or a club and\nyou thought it was amazing or pretty rubbish, let us know!!\nEmail me at: clubs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you\u2019re lucky, it might end up in felix!\nRoller-disco @ Renaissance\nRooms\nVauxhall\nThursdays, \u00a310, \u00a35 NUS\nice skating and the club operates a one\nway system to avoid collisions. However the atmosphere is very relaxed and\nyou mingle at the edge to chat or show\nsome moves on your skates.\nRenaissance Rooms is the perfect place\nto go with good friends or maybe take a\ngirl on a date as opposed to ice skating.\nThe best news is that on Thursdays\nit operates a student night, \u00a35 entry\nand free skate hire from 8pm till 12am\n(this is a bargain when you consider\nhow much ice skating costs). Drinks\nare standard London prices with few\noffers but this is not the place where\nyou want to get drunk. It\u2019s a safe option\nif you still want a good night out but\nfancy giving your liver a rest. The Club\nis also open on a Friday and Saturday\nnight, where entry prices rise to \u00a315 but\nit stays open till 2am.\nI accidently stumbled across Renaissance Rooms with a group of\nfriends one night whilst desperately\nsearching for somewhere to go in\nVauxhall. Dressed for a night\nout in a fashionable West\nEnd club we looked slightly\nout of place amongst the\nbright neon attire of fellow\nclubbers/skaters. However we\nstrapped on our wheels and\nwere soon flying around\nthe circuit to the rhythms\nof The Supremes, If this\nstill doesn\u2019t sound like\nyour idea of a good night\nout then I will point you in\nthe direction of one of my\nfriends who plays rugby\nfor Saracens and is\nwhat most would\ncall a \u2018Lad\u2019 but even\nhe was enjoying\nthe carnage of a\ntipsy roller disco.\nRenaissance\nRooms is situated\nminutes away from\nVauxhall Station and is\neasy to get to from anywhere in West London\nwith Tube links and\nmany night buses. So\nthrow off your dancing shoes and put on\nyour roller skates; then\nget your funk on!\nf\ny\nt\ny\ne\nd\nd\ns\nmy\ny\nby\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ns\ns\nn\ng\ng\ng\nis\nany-on\no\nd\nSo\nanc-ut on\ns; then\nn!\n\n"

You\u2019ve gradu-ated! Well, you haven\u2019t,\nobviously, otherwise\nyou wouldn\u2019t be reading this, but well done\nindeed to all those who did put on a\ndress and a stupid face on Wednesday\nand paraded up and down merry South\nKensington looking like you\u2019d just been\nnominated for a fucking Nobel prize.\nWell done you. You managed to maintain a level of work slightly below that\nwhich you showed at A-Level for four\nyears, without dropping face-first into\na bowl of Red Bull and Chinese food,\nfalling unconscious and waking up on\na plinth in Trafalgar Square. Three\ncheers for you and your unstoppable\nacademic momentum.\nDoes it really require the Royal Albert Hall to be emptied and filled\nwith thousands of simpering, besuited\ncocks? Does it? It lasted for almost\nhalf as long as your time at secondary school did, you worked probably\nhalf as hard as you did at secondary\nschool, and yet for some reason you\u2019ve\nobtained a License for Fuckwittery and\nplan to practise it with extreme preju-dice. The bastards stroll back and forth\nalong the walkway, their rented robes\nfluttering in the wind like a coat made\nof dreams. A dream coat. A dream\ncoat that says yes, I am a graduate. I\nhave graduated. Forget the fact I know\nsweet Fanny Adams about my subject\nand am going to spend my life eking out a living working for a fucking\nproject management team or pretending to do a PhD, let\u2019s all just focus on\nthe fact that I\u2019m a graduate.\nAnd they\u2019ve all got the same look on\ntheir face, right? It looks like they\u2019re\nabout to start high-fiving everyone in\nthe room. Literally everyone - a Professor will walk up to one of them and it\nlooks like a scene from a musical about\nto take place. Which I guess makes\nsense when you realise that more than\nhalf of these people are probably surprised they managed to get this far -you would be too, if you\u2019d essentially\nbullshitted your way through several\nyears of education.\nOh, but I\u2019m being mean. This is a big\nmoment, right? It\u2019s the time in everyone\u2019s life where they enter the real\nworld, where they become an adult, an\neducated member of society. Let them\nhave this time, this moment of reflec-tion, you old bastard.\nNo. Fuck off. They\u2019re the exact same\ncockbags that were prowling around\nthe canteen, the laboratories, the lecture halls last year, sneering and smug,\nit\u2019s just that this year they\u2019re allowed\nto do it. Why the hell would I let them\noff just because they\u2019ve got an excuse.\nIf the Rector\u2019s going to stand there and\nindividually kiss the arse of every one\nof them, from the first class Aeronautical Engineers through to the third class\nMaterials graduates, then I think we\u2019re\nwell within our rights to set fire to the\noccasional ceremonial robe.\nSo it\u2019s Friday for you. It\u2019s too late for\nyou to make a difference to the year\njust gone. But we can still act now. So\nlet\u2019s make today Kick A Fourth Year\nIn The Abdomen day, as a sort of preemptive strike.\nWant to tell me how your final year\nproject was a lot of work, actually?\nEmail me:\nanangrygeek@googlemail.com\nAditya Narayanan: the nature of friendship\n\u201cStudents here have\nnever lived away\nfrom home before.\nThe workload is\nintense and many\nget homesick\u201d\nW\nhat is the nature of\na friendship?

Seeing all\nthe freshers around\nthe place, faces bright with enthusiasm at the thought of university life I\nwonder, as someone on the verge of\ndeparture, is there any advice I could\npass on. What have I learnt that is of\nuse during my time here?\nLook in any lecture theatre and there\nseems to be an unwitting segregation\ntaking place between students on the\nsame course. It is a definite elephant in\nthe room; the sort of issue that people\nmutter about under their breath but\nrarely discuss seriously. In most cases\nit is unconscious and not intended to\nalienate anyone but in a few cases it\nresults in the type of attitude where\na group of people (including myself)\nwere prevented from joining one of the\noverseas societies in our second year.\nWhy? Because we weren\u2019t from the\ncountry in question.\nAn international student I know\nonce confessed she thought local students would not accept her if she so-cialised with them. This same person\nthen boasts of her pride at the fact her\nfellow nationals all look out for each\nother. Maybe if she treated everyone\nequally instead of singling out those\nwith the same passport as her she\nwould not have such a problem. These\nthings work both ways, and if your attitude towards people is already insular\nthen what right do you have to com-plain? Someone else complains that\nthose in their current social group do\nnot understand them. However, they\nrefuse to make friends outside of the\ngroup because they \u201cwouldn\u2019t be lasting friends\u201d due to the fact that after\ngraduation they will return home.\nFriends of mine tell me I must be \u2018one\nof theirs\u2019 because I hang out with them,\na perverse form of acceptance considering it is not based on who I am as a\nperson. Last time I checked, I chose my\nfriends based on whether I caouldtrust\nthem, not whether we shared some\nsuperficial link. In my experience,\nclosed-mindedness is an attribute of\nindividuals rather than any particular\ngroup \u2013 all it takes is one rotten apple\nfor the entire bunch to be tainted.\nPut yourself in another person\u2019s\nshoes. A large proportion of students\nhere have never lived away from home\nbefore. The workload is intense and\nmany get homesick \u2013 I know I did.\nMost of us are in the same boat, no\nmatter where we\u2019re from or what we\u2019re\nstudying, and unless we actually attempt to get to know someone, how\ncan we judge whether they are similar\nto us or not? In my first year I spent\nexcessive amounts of time with people\nI had nothing in common with purely\nbecause it was convenient to do so. It\nwas not until that February I actually\nmet a person I could talk to on a deeper level, and that too in the unlikeliest\nof circumstances. My closest friend is\nsomeone I only became friends with\nby accident, as we were revising in the\nsame location during exam season. On\nthe surface we are all from vastly different backgrounds, yet a lot of our attitudes are similar.\nImperial with the same clich\u00e9s: not\nenough girls, the union sucks, people\nare boring/antisocial. These people\nnever show any intention to go out and\nmeet people anyway, and treat alternative viewpoints to theirs with disdain.\nIn a similar vein, there are societies\nwhose openness towards others is almost non-existent. One only needs to\nlook at the level of backstabbing that\noccurs within the committees of most\nsocieties (not to mention the union it-self) to begin to feel apathetic towards\nits proceedings.\nFor me, a friend is someone who will\nbend their back to help you when you\nneed it, yet over the last three years I\nhave seen numerous people happy to\nsit in a comfort zone because it is easy\nto do so. Removed from the convenience of the situation, these people\nwould probably never be friends in the\nfirst place.\nAsk yourselves, be you new or soon-to-graduate, what makes you as a per-son? Is it measured by the company you\nkeep? Or is it defined by the choices\nyou make in life. Get out of your comfort zone and meet people you would\nnot normally socialise with; it will be\nworth it. They could be the friends you\nhave for life. Opening yourself up a little will make you appreciate your existing friends as well as potential new\nones. Don\u2019t feel intimidated, most people are just as self-conscious as you are.\nIf the roles were reversed, wouldn\u2019t you\nappreciate a friendly hello?\n\n"

Much of Europe\nis embroiled in a conflict whose effects will be felt most by the powerless\npeasants, voiceless pawns living their\nseemingly insignificant lives. There is,\nof course, much death and much pain\nand much suffering \u2013 and somewhere\nin the midst of all this hardship, there\nis an opportunity, so it would seem, to\nmake a quick buck.\nEnter Mutter Courage, the ever-hag-gling, ever-resilient \u2018hyena of war\u2019, who\nCaz Knight enters the bleak world of Becket and finds , well, a load of old rubbish and some very good actors\nis the central character in the German\nplay, by the Bertolt Brecht. The Tony\nKushner translation currently showing\nat the Olivier Theatre features Fiona\nShaw in the lead role. However, her\nnew persona is totally different from\nthat of Aunt Petunia\u2019s, who she plays in\nHarry Potter. Mother Courage is the\nultimate contradiction: she is a shrewd\nbusinesswoman who depends on war\nto make a living, while war slowly takes\nits toll on her life.\nThe stage crew are bustling about\non stage while the audience takes their\nseats, and this energy will be main-tainedthroughouttheproduction. Out\nbursts a vivacious Shaw perched on\nMother Courage\u2019s wagon, the symbol\nof her livelihood. She sings and dances\nand dashes about the stage, pausing\nonly to bargain for the goods she buys\nand sells in order to feed herself and\nher children. Through her adventurous exploits in bed, she is the mother\nof the brave but hot-blooded Eilif, the\nstupid but honest Swiss Cheese, and\nthe kind-hearted but mute Kattrin. All\nthree of her children will be lost to the\neffects of the war. At the moment each\none is taken away from her, she is else-where, haggling over some business\nMother Courage: Fiona Shaw ditches Aunt Petunia\nN\nothing is funnier than unhappiness\u201d. Regarded as one\nof Samuel Beckett\u2019s most\nimportant works, Endgame, written in 1957, had its first production staged at Imperial\u2019s \u201clocal\u201d, the\nRoyal Court that same year. The play\nwas performed as a French language\nproduction, the tongue in which it was\nfirst written and named Fin de Partie;\nthat moment in chess when there are\nvery few pieces left on the board: the\nend. Complicite\u2019s production at the\nDuchess theatre is the English version\nof the work which Beckett translated\nafter writing the original script in his\nsecond language.\nNotorious for his nihilistic and bleak\noutlook which became ever more so\nas the artist progressed through life,\nEndgame is no exception as the curtain opens on a fetid, featureless room\napparently devoid of any natural light,\nintelligent life or furniture. Enter Clov\nand moments later the tarpaulins are\nthrown off the only objects on stage\nto reveal the wheelchair-bound Hamm\nand two dustbins, after much meticulously folding of said tarpaulins.\nEverything is at \u201czero\u201d: the time, the\ntemperature and the state of the world\noutside the windows for Hamm, his\nservant Clov and Hamm\u2019s legless, dust-bin-residing parents Nagg and Nell (all\nwith appropriately dismal names) have\nexisted in a room in a world where\neven nature has abandoned them. The\nair of stagnation is potent creating an\nuncomfortable, eerie sensation heightened by the swirling of dust about the\nstage. Beckett has created a situation\nfrom which they cannot escape; he\nhas created a metaphor for the way in\nwhich we get stuck in our own lives,\ntrapped in cycles.\nFor a man who once professed to\nhating words, only using them because\n\u201cone has nothing else\u201d, Beckett certainly manipulates words effectively to add\nto the plot\u2019s peculiarity. Meanings are\ncontorted, as the ladder becomes \u201cthe\nsteps\u201d; \u201cbottle him\u201d a term used to put\nhis father back in his dustbin.\nThe importance of physical theatre is\npivotal in all Beckett\u2019s plays including\nthis one where what the audience sees\nis just as important to the meaning as\nwhat they hear. (Hence why perhaps\nthe French - les spectateurs \u2013 supposedly have a better visual imagination\nthan us Brits, the audience.)\nActions reflect the rut in which these\ncharacters are stuck. The repetition of\nClov folding the tarpaulin and Hamm\nfolding his bloody handkerchief into\nsmaller and smaller halves bring to mind\nastuckrecord,notbeingunabletoescape.\nWhere the production\u2019s vitality lies\nis in the discordant rapport between\nopposites Clov and his master, Hamm.\nOne cannot walk whilst the other cannot sit recalling the Grey Sisters in\nGreek mythology who have only one\neye and one tooth between them. Director Simon McBurney as the unenthusiastic Clov is duly monotonous,\nsave for momentary outbursts of rage\nand oddly resembles David Thewlis,\nwho starred as Clov in Conor McPherson\u2019s film version. But the play stands\nout spectacularly thanks to the glorious Mark Rylance playing the sedentary Hamm. His confinement to\nthe wheelchair is no hindrance to the\nrange of movement he is able to mus-ter, nor to the energy with which his\nbizarre gesticulations are mustered:\none has absolutely no difficulty imagining Johnny Depp in the role.\nThe company and cast, which include Tom Hickley and Miriam Margoyles who make a hilarious but all too\ntransaction. Nevertheless, she goes\ninto mourning during a brief period\nof peace \u2013 without war, how will she\nmake her living? Along the way, she\nbecomes the object of attraction for\nan earnest pastor and a general\u2019s cook,\nboth of whom she eventually rejects.\nRefusing to reflect upon the tragedy of\nher situation, she is ultimately focused\nsolely on survival, never lowering her\nstoic exterior; despite the pastor\u2019s pleas\nto free the \u2018woman\u2019 within her. The\nplay\u2019s irony is perhaps best captured in\na scene when she must tearfully pretend to not recognise her dead son\u2019s\nmutilated body in order to guarantee\nher escape \u2013 here, then, is someone\ncaught between her duties as a mother\nand what she must do to live on.\nIn this sense, the frenetic pace of this\nparticular adaptation works to some\nextent in amplifying the contradiction:\nthe jaunty, almost raucous nature that\nShaw gives to Mother Courage clashes\nsuccessfully with the harsh realities of\nwar in the backdrop, and makes some\nperverse moments \u2013 such as when\nCourage kicks her daughter\u2019s corpse to\nsee if she has really died \u2013 even more\njarring. Nevertheless, all the running\naround and brash shouting occasionally feels a little overdone, and, in\nthe huge two-hour-long first act, the\nacting can become slightly monoto-nous. This, in addition to the percussive music of Duke Special\u2019s band,\nwhich sometimes drowns out the lyrics of the interspersed songs, means\nthat some of the more sensitive moments in the play are not fully real-ised. For example, the final scene, in\nwhich Shaw is left pulling her wagon\non her own, toiling away despite her\nlosses, feels as if it has been glossed\nover, even though Brecht is using it\nas an important symbol of the common man\u2019s resigned attitude to war\nas something inevitable. The shorter\nsecond act does work better, with the\nbare usage of text in the set design\ncreating more space for some moving\nscenes. Overall, however, while not\nuninteresting, the production is a little underwhelming.\nbrief appearance, as the decomposing\nparents Nagg and Nell make a noble\neffort to inject much humour and life\ninto what is a very somber and intense\nplay. Especially when lasting over ninety minutes with no interval.\nCurrently at the National Theatre, we present Brecht via Tony Kushner via lots of running around and singing\nMother Courage is on at the National\nTheatre until 8th December which\ngives you plenty of time to get down\nthere.\nAs part of the Travelex Season, many\ntickets are available for \u00a310!\nFiona Shaw as Mother Courage, or should that be MC Mamma Courizzle?\n\n"

Still, it was a\ngood thing she made it when she did\nas the Beginners were up for their first\nchukka at 9am.\nThe Beginners didn\u2019t seem quite able\nto get their heads fully into the game\nand Nottingham appeared to have\na narrow advantage throughout the\nmatch and, despite some good breaks\nand runs from Imperial, Notts did finally manage to eek their way over our\nline to a narrow 1-0 victory. Cambridge\nin their traditional blue shirts cantered\nup to the centre line to oppose us and a\nscrappy chukka ensued from the word\ngo.\nNeither team seemed able to gain\nthe advantage and we watched on\nwith baited breath when each break\nwas met with solid defence and swift\nchanges of possession. Each time one\nteam seemed to get away and head for\ngoal the other managed to get a stick\ndown to hook an opponents or put\nenough pressure on to cause some other mistake.

After a\nhard fought victory against the 2nd XI\nboth in a friendly and the ULU Premier\nLeague, the team were looking to make\na strong start in BUCS. Brunel 4th XI\nwere the first opponents (14 October).\nA strong footballing university,\nBrunel showed their ability to control\nthe play with excellent awareness and\ngood passing. Going one-nil down at\nhalf time, Dave \u2018Robbo\u2019 Robinson, a\nQueen\u2019s Park Rangers coach who also\ncoaches the 1st and 2nd XI captain,\ndelivered a resounding team talk along\nwith captain Mustapher Botchway to\ngive the gentlemen the belief to get a\nresult.\nThe second half started strongly\nwith IC beginning to show their superior quality to Brunel. Brilliant passing\nfrom Dion Benincasa and good teamwork from Nathan Ferrol and Leslie\nEshun helped in overcoming the score-line to go 2-1 up.

The game\nended 2-2.\nSt Mary\u2019 University 3rd XI were the\nsecond opponents. Though good football was played by IC, the lack of attacking prowess rarely troubled the St\nMary\u2019s defence.

MANSOOR HAMAYUN\u2019S E.QUINOX TEAM ATTEMPT TO SOLVE\nRURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROBLEMS IN RWANDA; THEY SOMEWHAT SUCCEEDED\nR\nwanda Energy is an integral part to ensure an acceptable quality of life.\nAffordable electric power\nhas several benefits for\nthe developing world in areas such as\neducation, health care and finance.\nThe energy needed for most people in\nthe developing world is met through\nuse of primary fossil fuels such as fire\nwood and kerosene. The poor supply\ninfrastructure using multiple middlemen results in that the poorest in the\nworld often pay the highest to fulfill\ntheir energy requirements. However,\nmuch of the developing world is located in regions of the world where more\neffective use of renewable sources of\nenergy such as solar and wind can be\nobtained than many parts of the developed world.\ne.quinox, a student society of around\n15 people, founded some 15 months\nago at Imperial College London, recognized the problem of rural electrification and set out to create a solution\nto give the poorest in the world access\nto electric power in a economically\nsustainable manner. We at e.quinox\nchose Rwanda as the country to tailor\nour initial designs: due to its exotic location of being the \u2018heart of Africa\u2019, its\nproven track record of recent national\neconomic growth and only 6% of the\npopulation being connected to the\nelectric grid.\nSo what could be the technical solution towards rural electrification?\nThe cost analysis of a western type\ngrid network or micro-grid system\nproved to be very expensive with massive overhead and logistic costs associated with it. One of the most popular\ntopologies to rural electrification is a\ndecentralized energy production and\nconsumption system by which each\nhousehold is given a solar panel, battery and light. However, this type of\nsystem does not take advantage of the\neconomies of scale that centralized\nproduction offered. Furthermore, we\nwere interested in modeling the way\npeople buy kerosene. Currently, people\nin rural settings normally buy kerosene\nin small quantities to fulfill some days\nof consumption. This electrification of\nthe kerosene buying model we named\nas the \u2018Energy Kiosk\u2019 system. The idea\nwas that each household is given a\nbattery to use for lighting, mobile telephone charging and radio. When the\nbatteries are depleted they can go to\nthe energy kiosk and replace the depleted battery for a charged one in exchange for a small fee. Then came all\nthe hard questions, in which we needed\nreal quantifiable data: How much does\na typical household spend on kerosene\nper month? How many hours of light\ndo most people want? Are people even\nwilling to change to a LED based lighting solution, or does kerosene lighting\nhave a traditional value? Who would\nrun any system we set up in Rwanda?\nThe most important question: Where\nwould a student society, with no experience or credibility find the money\nto implement any proposed solution?\nWe understood that the only way an\ninexperienced group of students could\nestablish credibility was by partnering\nup with well recognized partners. In\nthe early stages of the project, we were\nable to confirm the Light Up the World\nFoundation (they have electrified over\n100.000 homes in over 40 countries)\nand the Institute of Engineering and\nTechnology (IET) as one of our official partners. These partners were\nonly able to offer us advice on different issues when we requested it; they\nwere more excited to see if a group of\nstudents could live up their claim and\ncommitment. At this stage we started\nto contact anyone that had any association with \u2018Energy\u2019 and \u2018Rwanda\u2019.\nIt may seem daunting in the beginning to contact organizations such as\nthe Ministry of Infrastructure and the\nUnited Nation Development Program.\nHowever, after some time you start\nunderstanding that each fancy organization is just a guy behind a desk with\na telephone, computer, secretary and\na budget somewhat bigger than your\nown.\nTwo days before the end of autumn\nterm we secured funds from EnVision,\nthe OC trust and the Department of\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering\nfor four of us to go to Rwanda. This\nlead to four of us (Tom Luth, Laurent\nVan Hocke, Chris Hopper and myself)\nlanding at Kigali International Airport\non 4th January 2009 12.05 PM local\ntime. We had a few meetings organized with the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) and with\nthe development arm of the Belgian\nGovernment i.e. the Belgian Technical Cooperation. Furthermore, we had\na meeting organized with a local solar\npanel supplier and an information staff\nmember of the Ministry of Infrastructure. So we started off at KIST and\ngave our pitch to the Rector of KIST\nand 15 minutes into the meeting he\nseemed very impressed and picked up\nhis phone and started to call someone.\nWe initially thought that this was a bit\nof a rude thing to do, but the Rector\nexplained afterwards that he just called\nthe Minister of Energy of Rwanda and\nthat he had agreed to meet us the following day. So this was the end of our\nday: a few hours after we landed, we\nwere secured to give a pitch to the\nMinister of Energy himself in one of\nhis fancy board rooms.\nThe following day we were picked up\nfrom our one star hotel by a SUV with\ndiplomatic plates to our first meeting\nwith the advisors to the Minister of\nEnergy. Four inexperienced students\nin their early twenties were asked to\ngive a pitch to some 25 top advisors to\nthe Minister regarding the concept of\nthe Energy Kiosk, and how it may be\nplaced in their national energy strat-egy. We answered each question they\nhad in a careful manner (we had done\na lot of background research and knew\nwhat we were talking about). Two\nhours later, we came out with smiling\nfaces, as the chief advisor agreed that\nour Energy Kiosk concept is a possible\nsolution towards rural electrification\nin Rwanda and could be included in the\nnational energy policy if we prove that\nthe system is economically sustainable.\nLater in the afternoon we met the Minister of Energy (Dr. Albert Butare) and\nreceived the official support from the\nGovernment of Rwanda, through the\nMinistry of Infrastructure. So we went\nhome that day having obtained the official support from the Government of\nRwanda, having got our project VAT\nexempted and promises for partial\nfunding for implementation.\nThis story repeated itself a few times\nand by the end of our January survey\ntrip to Rwanda we added to our list\npartners such as KIST, the Belgian\nTechnical Cooperation and the United\nNation Development Program. We\nthen visited 8 villages and surveyed\npeople\u2019s energy habits and enquired\nthe local governments the possibility\nfor us to implement the pilot project\nin their village. When we returned to\nLondon on 16th January 2009, we had\nachieved all of our objectives including\na location for a pilot project and obtaining all the required local support.\nAfter the January trip, the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering committed \u00a310.000 towards\nthe electrical equipment cost in Rwanda and the Government of Rwanda\ngenerously committed 11.000 Euros\nfor infrastructure. By end of May we\nhad all of our funding confirmed. Now\ncame the real hard work: to turn all\nof our words, written documents and\npromises, into reality i.e. a tangible\nproduct. Obvious questions popped\nup: Do we have enough money? How\ndo we get equipment to Rwanda? How\nlong will it take to install the Energy\nKiosk? We started to revise for exams\nand in-between squeeze in negotiations with suppliers and with our local\npartners in Rwanda. Although recession was hitting hard and unemployment was at an all time high, most of\nthe e.quinox members had internships\nto do. This resulted in one of the most\nintense summers in our lives. 8 AM -11\nPM working, in which we worked for\nour respective companies in the morning and on e.quinox in the evening.\nThe supply chain was quite complicated especially as we needed our main\ntechnology, \u2018The SparkBox\u2019, to be manufactured in-house for 60 households.\nThere was an official contract between e.quinox and the Government of\nRwanda to implement the Energy Kiosk. One of our contractual obligations\nwas to train and employ two shopkeepers to handle the day-to-day running of\nour system. This was probably one of\nthe hardest tasks during our Energy\nKiosk implementation. Firstly, we had\nno means of communicating with our\npotential candidates directly. We had\nto use our local team from Kigali Institute of Science and Technology to\nhelp us in the translation process. We\norganized an assessment centre type\nstyle selection process which involved\ninterviews, a practical exam and a\nwritten exam. Finally, two people were\nselected and were given confirmed\nemployment till the end of December.\nThe employees were very enthusiastic\nto have been given the opportunity to\nwork with the new technology in the\nvillage.\nA few weeks later we had a fully running Energy Kiosk. During our last\nmeeting with the Minister of Energy\nand his advisors there were suggestions that the Government of Rwanda\nwill sponsor up to 10 new implementations of our Energy Kiosk concept in\nRwanda (valued in excess of 100 000\nEuros) .\nEach member of e.quinox contributed to a critical element of the project\nand together we worked to achieve\nsomething many said would impossi-Do people in Rwanda need electric power?\nNone of the members of e.quinox were from Rwanda or had a firm idea of conditions people lived\nunder there. The first fundamental question was: do people in the developing world, in particular\nRwanda, need electric power? Rather than looking at the source of energy, such as firewood or solar\npanels, they started to investigate the uses of energy. From obtaining reports on energy consumption\nin East African Countries and by talking to one of our initial partners, the Light up the World\nFoundation, the team found that people in the developing world spend a considerable amount of their\nincome on kerosene based lighting applications in their homes. Using this information the team set the\ndesign criteria. They needed to make a system for home lighting application in a renewable manner\nwhich is of higher quality and cheaper than kerosene.\nThe e.quinox team Laurent Van Houcke, Christopher Hopper, Tom Luth, Alexander Rybka, M.

Well, the article in\nquestion regarded whether the manipulation of babies\u2019 spines was in any\nway effective for the treatment of ear\ninfections (no), or potentially damaging to their health (unsurprisingly,\nthe evidence suggests this may be the\ncase); the appeal regards whether or\nnot Singh, as a scientist and writer,\ncould criticise such potentially dangerous practices in the public domain.\nRather than present their evidence and\npublically argue the point, the British\nChiropractic Association attempted\nto stifle any debate by suing for libel in\nthe courts.\nSingh now faces being bankrupted\nby the practitioners of this dubious art,\nfor \u2018defaming their reputation\u2019 through\nwhat many argue is a very valid criti-cism. As a result, the outcome could\nbe vital for us all: for science to move\nforward, we have to be able to pick\nholes in one another\u2019s ideas and prac-tices, and if this can be quashed via the\ncourts rather than through research\nand analysis of the data, then we may\nas well all go home. Furthermore, this\nisn\u2019t just about someone\u2019s pet ideas \u2013 if\ndata regarding ineffective and potentially harmful \u2018therapies\u2019 can be hidden\nin this way, how can you or anyone else\npossibly make an informed decision\nregarding their health or that of their\nchildren?\nThe outcome of this case may well\nyet be positive, whether Singh eventually wins or loses the protracted legal\nargument. A campaign orchestrated\nby Sense About Science has garnered\nsome twenty thousand signatures in\nsupport of both his case and numerous\nothers, where scientists and potential\nwhistleblowers have been prevented\nfrom making factually accurate statements under fear of prosecution due\nto Britain\u2019s arcane libel laws. Look it\nup and add your name: in the course of\nyour career as a scientist, you will definitely be called upon to criticise the\nwork of others. Whether you are able\nto or not without fear of reprisal may\ndepend upon the outcome of this case.\nFor more information visit www.sen-seaboutscience.org.uk/freedebate\nScientists disparage UKBA plan for genetic passports\nShupaulaDass\nShupaulaDass Science Reporter\nWe\u2019ve all had that awful passport\nphoto. The one that fails to capture\nour natural beauty or at the very least,\noneself on an OK day. We may envy\nthose without passports. Or not. The\nBritish government is now toying with\nthe idea of using genetics to identify\nnationality.\nThe UK Border Agency has contacted researchers with a proposal of\ngenetically testing asylum seekers, specifically from the war fractured Somalia. Their goal is to separate the genuine\napplicants from those in neighbouring\nKenya. Unfortunately for the paper\npushers, this will remain a dream as\nthe latest editorial in Nature disparages the plan; \u2018[The] scheme to establish nationality through DNA testing is\nscientifically flawed, ethically dubious\nand damaging to science.\u2019\nIn a nutshell, the government wanted to examine the unique SNPs (sin-gle nucleotide polymorphisms) in the\nmitochondria of approximately 100\n\u2018Somalians\u2019.\nAn SNP is exactly what it says on\nthe tin. A variation in DNA sequence\nof a genome attributed to a single nucleotide - A, T, G, or C and it differs\nbetween members of a species. For\nexample:\nPerson 1 reads: ATGGC\nPerson 2 reads: ATGAC\nTraditionally if these differences in\nalleles (the G and the A from Persons\n1 and 2) occurred at a frequency of 1%\nor greater, they were labeled as SNPs\nor snips. However as science has pro-gressed, snips that occur less than 1%\nare included.\nThe genotyping of SNPs is probably\nwhat has conjured the idea of \u2018geneticisation\u2019 of nationality.\nRecently scientists have compiled\nsubstantial SNP databases, leading to\neasier geographical identification of\nEuropean groups. However scientists\nstress that it would be like a shot in the\ndark to apply this method to a continent such as Africa.\nWe at Felix asked visiting Professor\nDavid Balding, a population geneti-cist, why European populations are\neasier to study than African. \u2018Nobody\nhas quantified the misclassification\nrate. Europeans are very well studied\nand relatively homogeneous; their genetic patterns are fairly simple because\nof the recent settlement of much of\nEurope. African populations go back\nfurther in time, have greater levels of\ngenetic variation and are not well stud-ied. I do not think the research exists\nto adequately underpin the proposed\nprogramme. Even if it did there would\nstill be a relatively high error rate because of recent migrations.\u2019\nAnother method voiced involved\nusing the isotopic ratios of elements\nfound in hair and fingernails. These\nprovide an indication of an individual\u2019s\ndiet and environment. Again this argument can be quashed. It does not\ntake into account the factor of human\npopulations migrating, which has happened for thousands of years. Genetic\nvariability is not confined to borders.\nEpigenetics (the idea that the environment interacts with our genes) is pos-sible, but to base a person\u2019s future entirely on such methods is incredulous.\nProposal for genuine asylum seekers to be identfied through genetic testing deemed \u2018scientifically flawed\u2019\nAn example of this failing would be\na Somalian who has parents from two\ndifferent geographic regions. This\nchild would be of a third region belonging to neither \u2018genetic geographic\nregion\u2019. A simple concept, but omitted\nentirely from the UK Border Agency\u2019s\nplan. They seem to be confusing ancestry with nationality.\nBeyond the fickle rationale of the\ngovernment\u2019s plans, the implications\nof enforcing the genetic testing are se-vere. If they wanted to pursue this path,\nlarge genetic samples from Somalia\nand surrounding countries would be\nneeded, raising the issue of time and\nmoney. Many groups would inevitably come forward to protest such as\nmigration organizations, population\ngeneticists and the public themselves.\nCurrently asylum seekers have the\nchoice of providing swabs for testing\nor not. If the genetic testing becomes\nstandard procedure and an individual\nrejects, it could worsen the relations\nand situation. Further cause of suspicion would only be aroused as a result.\nAs Orwell predicted in his novel\n1984, we are in a Big Brother age.\nWith so many advances it has become\nhard to rein in scientific speculation.\nTechnically by now we should all have\nnational I.D cards, our iris scans on\nrecord and flying around campus on\nhoverboards. Whilst the latter may still\nbe a little far fetched, so is the idea of\ngenetic passports at this time, or ever.\nThankfully, the government has backtracked on their idea, but they haven\u2019t\ndismissed it altogether.\nI don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t\nmind my passport photo so much now.\nIn any case, it expires in 10 years.\nPopular science writer, Simon Singh, has been accused of \u2018defaming the\nreputation\u2019 of the British Chiropractic Association\n\n"

When I could say\nbula (hello) and yadra sia (good\nmorning) to every single person sauntering down the streets of Labasa\n\u2013 town and transit point between\nVorovoro and the rest of Fiji \u2013 I had\nno doubt that Fijians are amongst the\nfriendliest people on our increasingly\nfrigid planet. But to actually belong\nto a family that cast aside their differences of language, skin colour, eti-quettes and habits, was a privilege I\nhadn\u2019t found anywhere else.\nAnd though my patchy Fijian could\nuse some polishing \u2013 I could always\nattend a culture class on-island and\nlearn useful phrases and songs \u2013 I\ngradually incorporated my lifestyle\nwith the Fijian ways of life. My sense\nof urgency vanished overnight, I\nworked as I saw fit even though I\nwould never refuse a request for\nhelp; the line sega na lega (no wor-ries) became my catchphrase, and I\nwould never accept a bilo with less\nthan a \u2018high tide\u2019 of kava brimming in\nthe coconut shell. And I couldn\u2019t see\nanother way to end an evening than\nsensing the drum on the touch of my\nfingertips, rocking to the beat, and\nfeeling belittled by the natural musical talents of those surrounding me.\nIt was as though Vorovoro breathed\nand lived in a separate existence to\nthe rest of the world. It was twisted\nlogic. It was a collective bunch of people coming together, all bearing in\nmind that a little bit of fun is what we\nneed to introduce to our lives, harsh\nand unforgiving as they are. Think\nLord of the Flies, or The Beach, minus island politics, armed marijuana\nfarmers and sexual complications.\nWhen Chez, a fellow tribe mem-ber, had found a frog lounging in her\nbed, an \u2018investigation\u2019 was swiftly\nlaunched and a \u2018trial\u2019 scheduled \u2013 apparently the activity of \u2018frog-bombing\u2019 was such a rife prank-related\nphenomenon that Tui Mali himself\noutlawed it. Whatever the outcome of\nthe trial turned out to be \u2013 unfortunately I missed the occasion as it took\nplace on my day of departure \u2013 there\nwouldn\u2019t be any serious punishment.\nOn Vorovoro, deliverance of bureaucracy and justice could only be served\nwith a light-hearted attitude.\nMadness, did you say? You have yet\nto hear about the \u2018string-man challenge\u2019, where Pete the string-man had\nopted to spend 24-hours in a ham-mock; the 50-odd school children\nwho ransacked our island with mischief and laughter; the two hours and\ntwelve minutes record time for Amy\nthe Iron Maiden to swim around\nthe island and sprint across the four\npeaks of Vorovoro. It was this very\nmadness that brought out the best of\nour personalities, our perceptions to\nchallenges.\nMeet Oliver, the five-year-old\nyoungest of the Cahill family hailing from Indiana. He would wield a\nmachete with more proficiency than\nI do, or any of my peers. He would\ntread, barefoot, on ground so jagged\nthat I could only replicate such a feat\nwith a girly squeal.\nOr meet Epeli \u2013 more affectionately\nknown as Pupu \u2013 who recently celebrated his seventieth but continued\nto shame thirty-year-olds with his\nstrength and chainsaw skills. He was\nthe man who coined the phrase that\nachieved legendary status on the is-land: \u201cnothing [is] hard in this world\u201d.\nHe certainly didn\u2019t find it hard to\nconceal his pain, as I discovered when\nthe Fijian told me vividly over grog\nhow he managed to accidentally drive\nseveral nails through the flesh of his\npalm.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all insanity on the island \u2013 there were pressing issues that\nthe community was attempting to address and deal with. Like the rising of\nsea level, or alterations in climate patterns \u2013 we had an extraordinarily wet\ndry season this summer \u2013 or shortages in food supplies if we persisted in\nour consumerist ways. All reflected\nvibrantly by the deterioration of the\nsceneries we had grown to adore, and\nwould pain us to see destroyed and\ndevoured by our greed.\nNot only had Vorovoro converted\nmy lifestyle, it was where my love\naffair for the environment had truly\nbegun. Not the radical kind, but that\nof admiration for the power of nature\nand awareness of what we are doing\nto our planet.\nWith blades of the wind turbine\nswishing above our heads, solar panels basking and harvesting under the\nsun, biodiesel engines grinding and\nreeking, it wasn\u2019t difficult to envision\na community of total self-sustainabil-ity. And with the village \u2013 including\nthe Grand Bure, dormitories, kitchen,\ncompost toilets \u2013 entirely built by\nthe hands of tribe members past and\npresent, piglets and chickens raised\nand ready for slaughter, veg patches\nadorned with produce, the \u2018dream\u2019\ndidn\u2019t seem the least unrealistic to\nme.\nWhat about the luxury and conveniences I should have experienced\nwhen I embark on this \u2018holiday package\u2019? Well, creating convenience\nand moving away from traditional\nlifestyles aren\u2019t necessarily advance-ment, or evolution; rather, we are forgetting the smidgens of wisdom that\nhad allowed our ancestors to coexist\nwith their environment. It is this realisation that set apart my other travel\nexperiences from the week spent on\nVorovoro.\nBut the dream doesn\u2019t necessarily\nend on Vorovoro.\nAs the children descended upon the\nshores, they were instructed to help\npick up rubbish on sections of beach\nwhere much junk had been washed\nup. Though it wasn\u2019t so much about\nthe costless manual labour \u2013 I did\nhowever suspect it was a motivation \u2013\ngearing their curiosity towards recycling and waste management was the\none thing we tried to achieve on the\nday. The future generation of Fijians\nwere now gathered on Vorovoro, and\nit was our duty to inspire and educate\nthose who would spread Tribewanted\u2019s legacy throughout the country, if\nnot the South Pacific or the rest of the\nworld.\nAnd with Vorovoro treated by many\nas test ground for fusing sustainability technology with the old ways of\nliving, who knows where this legacy\nwould take us?\n*\nIsa Lei expresses one\u2019s remorse on\nthe subject of departure. I had been\nstruck by the sentimentality of the\nsong when lined up on the beach,\nsaying my goodbyes to the departing members. Stepping back from the\nscene as the final moce (goodbye) was\ncried out, I attempted to comprehend\nthe poignant metaphor it represented\n\u2013 I had just gazed into the bridge between life and death. The tribe had\nbeen blissfully oblivious of the unknown that lie beyond those shores\n\u2013 but what would happen when it was\ntime to leave?\nThe thought reflected bluntly on\nmy perception of the matter: should\nI shun death with utmost fright,\nor should I treat it as yet another\nadventure?\nAnd now, arousing cradled in the\ncomforts of the hammock and morning breeze, it was time to pack and\nready myself for my share of Isa Lei.\nConfession: I failed. I disembarked\nsome seven days ago with the determination to not get too involved with\nthe island\u2019s affairs, to save myself the\nheartbreak. I distanced myself from\nongoing projects, sought not to engage with people or develop any intimate relationships, and concealed my\ntrue personality in order to achieve\nisolation. How wrong was I. Not solely for the reason that it denied all of\nmy laws and ethics of travelling, but\nfor so na\u00efvely believing that my remoteness can win against the captivation that was Vorovoro Island and\nits inhabitants.\nThey say Vorovoro is one of the\nhardest places on Earth for goodbyes.\nFinal words aside, all I could do was\nfighting back the tears. As the engines fired up, motorboat scoring a\ntrail of foam against the waters, I took\na glimpse behind my shoulder. The island had diminished into the horizon\n\u2013 inevitably I began to feel \u2018homesick\u2019.\nVorovoro had now become the place\nwhere I had left behind a shard of my\nheart and \u2013 I cursed under my breath\nas realisation kicked in \u2013 my only pair\nof board shorts.\nBen uttered something about the\nisland being my home, and that I am\nalways welcome to return. One day\nperhaps?\nA week\u2019s stay on Tribewanted: Vorovoro costs \u00a3200, which includes food,\naccommodation and transfers to and from the island. Visit Tribewanted\u2019s\nwebsite (http://www.tribewanted.com) for more details on Vorovoro\nand the project, or sign up for free to become an online tribe member.\nPresenting a sevusevu \u2013 a bunch of kava roots \u2013 to local chief Tui Mali Me and the fellow tribe members\n\n"

Bucks\nhave been old rivals to the college and\nhave had a cemented position in the\nleague for many years. The hard work\nthe players put into pre-season shone\nthrough as Imperial quickly laid down\na 10 point lead. Things soon settled\ndown with the Imperial side dominating possession. This inevitably resulted\nin more points for the away team. With\nthe score board ticking over Imperial\nhad a 17-0 lead by half time.\nThe second half proved to be less of a\nchallenge. The home team were exhaust-ed, making it easy to control the game\nand pile on the pressure. Strong defence\nproduced several turn over tries, which\nagain strengthened Imperial\u2019s grip on\nthe game. Special mention goes to Hugh\nDingleberry for his amazing defence and\nthe impact he had on every try scored.\nThe final score was a 41-0 away win, a\ngood platform to build from for league\nsuccess.\nTries: Carroll (3), Chalke, Johnstone,\nHarris, Godfrey\nConversions: Godfrey (3)\nImperial Squad: C. O\u2019Rourke, A.\nJohnstone, A. Tenison-collins, C. Esberger, E. Labinski, T. Zeal, J. Pettit\n(Capt), C. Cotter, F. Chalke, G. Lane, J.\nHarris, T. Carroll, D. Godfrey, J. Newton, M. Joachim, M.

St Mary\u2019s University\nCollege Men\u2019s 2nd XV are a team that\nfeed their own 1st XV (frequent winners of the BUCS Cup) and Harlequins\nRugby Club.\nThe Rugby boys were able to mount\na staggering 43-7 victory of their local London rivals in the BUCS league.\nA combination of strong defence and\nwell worked attack meant that Imperial seemed to be able to score from\nalmost any situation. Once again special mention goes to super-sub Hugh\nDingleberry for his all-round efforts.\nHe congratulated the players saying\nthat \u201cno one deserved to be singled\nout from today\u2019s efforts. However, the\ntry scorers and man of the match also\nplayed well.\u201d\nNext week Imperial College face Imperial Medicals, who are both the only\nundefeated teams in the league.\nTries: T. Carroll (6), C. Cotter\nConversions: D. Godfrey (4)\nSquad: C. O\u2019Rourke, A. Johnstone,\nA. Tenison-collins, C. Esberger, E. Labinski, T. Zeal, J. Pettit (C), C. Cotter, F.\nChalke, G. Lane, J.

Jarman, Hugh Dingleberry\nMen return to form by conquering London\nYes, you heard correct, the men of IC\ntennis are back in form and they demonstrated it on Wednesday against\nKing\u2019s College, winning 7-3. The eager 1st team travelled to Burgess Park,\nseeking to get back on track after losing their first match of the season.\nThe afternoon began with two very\ncompetitive doubles matches, with the\nresult split between the two teams.\nImperial\u2019s Franco-Argentinean duo,\ncomprising of Pio Monti and Pierre\nDelestrade, took on King\u2019s number one\ndoubles pair; who were equally multi-cultured, with a typical lean, powerful,\nBritish boy accompanied by a touchy\nand wise Mauritian veteran.\nThe Imperial scientists started\nstrongly, hitting clean, laminar shots,\nwhich earned them an early break.\nHowever, with the Imperial boys getting frustrated with the classy touch\nof the Mauritian, the Kings pair came\nback fiercely. The match was tight until 6-6, when King\u2019s crucially broke the\nImperial serve.\nThe hammering British boy then\nproduced what was probably the best\nservice game of his life, powering aces,\nand although the game was brought to\ndeuce, the King\u2019s lads were able to conclude on their solid performance and\nwon 8-6.\nAvinash Murphy and Adam Gunasekara represented Imperial in the\n2nd doubles match. The duo played\nsolidly, holding their serve to win the\nmatch 8-5.\nWith the doubles completed, the singles began. Team captain Pio comfortably won the 1st singles, quickly taking\nthe match 6-2 6-0. Avinash played 2nd\nsingles, against arguably the strongest\nplayer of the Kings squad. A combination of wet conditions and a quality opponent resulted in Avinash losing his\nmatch. Fresher Adam played only his\nsecond match of the season in the 3rd\nsingles. Adam controlled the match\nfrom the beginning, moving his opponent around the court and showing\ninitiative. It took him little time to cash\nin a 6-0 6-0 victory. Pierre played the\n4th singles where he made good use of\nhis baseline game to dominate rallies\nand finish well at the net, to take the\nmatch 6-3 6-1.\nAfter a day of satisfying tennis, the\nteam headed home for a well earned\nshower and some rest before hitting\nthe union like the party animals you\nknow they are!\nThe Men\u2019s 2nd Team and the Womens team did not fare so well. The\nmen lost 4-6 to the Greenwich 1st\nteam and the women lost 1-9 to\nPortsmouth 1st. Better luck next\nweek!\nRebecca Smith &\nPio Monti\nTennis\nICBC at Pair\u2019s\nHead of the\nRiver 2009\nChristina Duffy Rowing\nImperial College Boat Club had six\nboats finishing in the Top 50 at the\nPair\u2019s Head of the River Race last\nweekend.\nThe 4 kilometre race takes place on\nthe Thames tideway downstream from\nChiswick to Hammersmith Bridge on\nthe ebb Tide.\nFirst year Biochemistry student Simon Steele and third year Mechanical Engineering student Adam Seward\nwere the fastest College boat on the\nday finishing second in the IM2.2x category and 9th overall.\nIn the elite pair\u2019s event Master\u2019s students Adam Freeman-Pask and Ole\nTietz finished 3rd and 28th overall\nrespectively.\n[Other results: Henry Goodier/Leo\nCarrington 2nd in IM3.2x (17th over-all), Alex Gillies/Jamie Kirkwood 13th\nin IM1.2x, (20th overall), Danny Bellion/Will Todd 10th in IM2.2x (45th\noverall), Richard Winchester/Andy\nGordon 4th in IM3.2x (46th overall)]\nPresident Bush didn\u2019t just bare all in the felixSport interview last week\nSimon Steele and Adam Seward were the fastest IC boat on the day\nPICTURE COURTESY OF NICK ABLITT\n\n"

Here are some\ntop tips for de-geeking yourself and\n\u2018bringing on the cool!\u2019\nTip 1: NEVER use the phrase \u2018bringing\non the cool!\u2019\nTip 2: SKIP LECTURES. Nothing\nshouts \u2018cool\u2019 louder than outright lazi-ness. Make sure your absense is noted\nby everyone. This may involve turning\nup to the end of the lecture and shout-ing, \u2018SORRY I\u2019M LATE. I WAS BUSY\nNOT GIVING A SHIT ABOUT THIS\nCOURSE!\u2019 Then walk straight back out\nTip 3: (FOR THE GUYS) Don\u2019t moan\nabout the male-to-female ratio. This\ndoes not bother you! You actually came\nto Imperial for a challenge. You\u2019re tired\nof scoring so much pussy and your dick\nneeds a holiday. Then look and your\nmanhood and say, \u2018not much of a holiday is it boy?\u2019\nIf you\u2019re too cool to be \u2018reading\u2019, here\u2019s a hint... it\u2019s not that hard\nChumps vs Geeks:\nRound 1\nThe X-Factor:\nit\u2019s a sadist\u2019s\nwet dream\nT\nW\nhen I tell people at Imperial that I watch the\nX factor, they contort\ntheir faces in disgust\nand then \u2018tut\u2019 condescendingly. I\nsometimes think they\u2019d look less horrified if I told them that I thought that\nholocaust didn\u2019t happen (Great icebreaker by the way).\nYou have to remember that most\nImperial students sit on top of the\nclass pyramid and shout to the commoners below, \u201cDance for me plebians\nand sniff my organic shit! That smell\nis descended from lords. LORDS!\u201d\nThere is a strict criteria for middle-class television viewing; if Jeremy\nPaxman or Stephen Fry aren\u2019t on the\ncredits then it\u2019s working-class. Considering the fact that Simon Cowell\nis neither Jeremy Paxman, or Stephen\nFry, we can conclude that the X-factor\nis nothing more than brain-numbing,\nblue-collar garbage.\nWell, you know what? Fuck you!\nBehind the garish and contrived apparel is a dark and sinister feast that\nfeeds sadistic twats like myself.\nI love to watch people fail and that\u2019s\nwhat makes reality TV so enjoyable.\nWhilst the neanderthal majority of\nthe X factor\u2019s viewers clap and drool\nover the pretty flashing lights and\nCheryl Cole\u2019s breasts, I lick the tears\nof misery right off Rachel\u2019s stupid\nface as she gets told, for a second\nweek running, that no-one likes her.\nWe\u2019re all bastards really. We take\ngreat pleasure in other\u2019s misfor-tunes. It\u2019s blissful schadenfreude.\nWe\u2019ve been told, since the day that\nwe learnt to point and laugh, that\nwe should stop staring and keep our\nthoughts to ourselves.If staring was\nsocially acceptable then we\u2019d all be\nmuch happier. No-one likes to force\nthemselves to turn their eyes away\nfrom the limbless pillow-of-a-man as\nhe tries to get his wheelchair through\nthe doors of HMV with nothing but\nhis chin, but we\u2019ve been conditioned\nto accept freakshows in the street as\ncommonplace.\nWell thank God for the X-factor!\nThe show that\u2019s let us laugh at our rejects of society since 2004.\nAnonymous\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nAnonymous\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to\nbeing \u2018Cool\u2019 at Imperial\nTip 4: (FOR THE GIRLS) Avoid guys\nthat talk to their manhood.\nTip 5: (FOR THE GUYS) Join the rugby team - the epitome of \u2018coolness\u2019. If\ncatching a ball and running into people is your ideal sport, then rugby is for\nyou! Girls simply love loud obnoxious\noafs with a narrow vocabulary of \u2018tits\u2019\nand \u2018beer\u2019.\nTip 6: (FOR THE GIRLS) Don\u2019t join\nthe rugby team\nTip 7: Start Smoking. Anything detrimental to your health is \u2018cool\u2019. This\nincludes running into walls and AIDS.\nTip 8: Try to subtly divert conversation\ntowards your Daddy\u2019s annual income.\nExample: \u201cSo what sort of music are\nyou into?\u201d \u201cOh right, yeah, he earns\ntwo and a half million a year\u201d\nTip 9: On a night out, people love to\nknow if you\u2019re drunk, so make sure\nyou tell them every fucking minute!\n11 reasons why we hate the football team\nThen tell them that you love drinking\nand that you\u2019re always the life and soul\nof the party and that no-one gets as\ndrunk as you. If they still don\u2019t believe\nyou, bring a breath-a-liser or blood-testing kit. They NEED to know that\nyou\u2019re drunk.\nTip 10: If you\u2019re watching a film in\nyour common room, or just with a\ngroup of friends, alert them when a\nfunny bit is coming up. It\u2019s your job to\ntell them that it\u2019s funny and prepare\nthem for the gag. They\u2019ll really appreciate this because they probably would\nhave missed it otherwise.\nTip 11: Maintain a collection of skintight attire, preferably in a selection\nof matt colours. Combine this with\ncarrying your protein shake in one of\nthose ultra-cool shakers! Remember to\nstretch those calves...\nTip 12: When reading felix, skip\nstraight to \u2018Hangman\u2019, read the first article and never pick up felix again.\nHangman\nHangman\n1.

After having bought huge\namounts of chips in the vain hope that\nthese would fuel us over the next 48\nhours, we arrived about 1:30am to a\ncold, beautiful, starry night.\n33 people made easy work of unpack-ing, and before long people had sorted\ntheir beds (including a long line of all\ngirls \u2013 nice work for Imperial!). By 3 or\n4am the talk had died down and heavy\nbreathing filled the hut\u2019s two floors and\nthe 5 tents outside (free pizza obviously has a certain pull).\nOn a weekend full of firsts, Thea Powell climbs Snowdon as her first mountain, with 32 others... and a frog\nBy 8am on Saturday we were up and\nready to go, consuming the thickest\nconcrete-porridge for breakfast (a la\nJim) to drive our ascent up Snowdon, a\nhuge (in-my-lack-of-experience) 1085\nmeters! The sun was shinning (big\ngrins) and, with what felt like the perfect outdoor-loving atmosphere, the\ngroup split into two and we were off!\nAs conversation covered travel, mu-sic, food and photos (all those things\nthat we basically don\u2019t have money\nfor), our feet began to make headway.\nAfter only a few hours we had already\nreached a beautiful ridge, with old\nmining sites, mountains and few humans as a rewarding view. Below the\nshinning blue sky (again \u2013 yay!) and far\nabove the sea, I and the other \u2018freshers\u2019\nlooked up \u2013 and up \u2013 to the summit,\nwhich we were told was only another\nhour away.\nAs a true lover of travel and nature,\nand as a third year, I have a few things\nto admit. This was only my second\ntrip with any Imperial club. This was\nmy first full mountain climb. This was\nmy first trip to Wales (hangs head in\nshame).\nThe combination of sun and altitude produced a very confusing\nhot-cold mash and the steep incline\nleft me panting and regretting a pre-gym-training-trip. This said, this was\nfast becoming a fantastic experience\nfor me. I hope everyone there felt the\nsame!\nSome pushes up steep bits\nleft me panting and feeling a little\ndaunted, but every biscuit, mint cake\nand photo stop made it all worth it.\nMost stops for me consisted of taking\nphotos, taking far more time than I\nusually do in London. All us newbies\nwere sweat drenched and smiling.\nFirst (and only) lunch was placed\njust below the summit, which was surprisingly busy (silly train), and complete with Pimms for a lucky few. The\n1085m summit and banner photo was\nceremoniously recorded, and people\nwho had known each other less than 12\nhours found they already had so much\nin common.\nBack at the hut, the cutting of huge\namounts of onions (Rachel and I got\nquite emotional) and the exposure of\nJim\u2019s huge stiff sausage (seriously \u2013\nask Alex for details) meant the dinner\nvat was steadily filling. Expecting the\nleast? No need. Hot showers, tea, a fire,\npub opportunities and all the cheesy\npasta (with the largest amount of pepper I\u2019ve ever tasted) you could eat, the\nevening was in full swing. With all this,\nand a dessert of margarine-biscuit-caramel-condensed-milk-banoffee pie\n(complete with mystery), the standards\nfor future trips had defiantly been set.\nAfter two (early but sleepy) games of\nWerewolf (complete with accents), we\nall finally climbed into various things\nwe summarised as beds.\nSunday \u2013 and the \u2018dawn chorus\u2019 of\ncutlery alarm clocks harshly woke us\nto a cloudy day. With aching muscles,\nwe packed and gorged on much better porridge. The washing up (myself\nparticularly enjoying the burnt layer of\nporridge) and roof packing were steadily finished, and the last of those chips\n(with old vinegar and new cheese)\nmade a dubious second breakfast.\nWithin three hours we were nearing\nCnicht and the clouds on a much wet-ter, muddier, greener climb.\nNew views of beautiful lakes kept\nus happy, as well as bogs (particularly\nkeen on Rachel), and our new addition Snowdon the frog, who I propose\nas official fresher trip mascot. Having\nhad first lunch earlier we were now\namongst the clouds, mountains and\nvalleys and members in the group\nquickly became Lord of the Rings characters \u2013 complete with white Shadowfax parked patiently. The summit was\nthe exact opposite of Saturday with visibility low, wet trousers, soggy feet and\ndrenched fringes. It\u2019s true that in the\nUK you get wet, but it won\u2019t kill you\n(and you might even get walking-boot-heated swimming pools).\nAfter a rocky, steep, weight-distrib-uting descent, the rain stopped and we\nbegan to see what we had just climbed\nup looming behind us. Back with\ndisco bus and Shadowfax, the warm\nclothes, different shoes (poor Peter!)\nand booming Jolene, the satisfaction of\nthe walking was made even better. In\nthe two days we had walked over 31km\nand ascended over 1700m.\nBefore we know it, we\u2019re speeding\nhome and I\u2019m writing this on the Mwhatever in the dark, looking forward\nto a pub dinner. I\u2019ll leave the awesome\nstreet and roof dancing outside Beit at\n11.30pm to \u2018Wonderwall\u2019 and \u2018Jolene\u2019\nto be re-enacted one day. There are no\nwords.\nIn my last year I am obviously going to be in the library a depressing\namount. A new silver lining to this is\nthat with dozens of new friends and\nLOTS of lactate in legs, the Fellwanderers are exactly what you would expect from the first impression.\nI would encourage anyone and everyone to get involved in this society.\nFor these reasons (and the amazing\nUK countryside), I am hooked. I hope\nthe other freshers are too - roll on Lake\nDistrict!\nYour Club or Society Here.\nDescription of your awesome trip or event here.\nThere are 346 clubs and societies at Imperial. Want your club to be in felix?\nSend us a description of a trip, event, tour or social\nwith some good pictures and everyone will know about it.\nEmail clubs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhat happens when CivEng and Physics students try to defy gravity.\nIt turns out bears will eat anything except extremely spicy cheesy pasta. Freshers are far less picky.\n\n"

Simon Worthington reports\nVista Be Gone!\nW\nell you could be forgiven for thinking this\nis a Windows week with\nMicrosoft launching\nthe much heralded Windows 7 onto\nthe unsuspecting public. Us Brits even\nmanaged to get it early for a change,\ndue to the bloody postal strikes. Simon\u2019s got a great article for you on that\nto your left along with a down right\nfantastic deal for students.\nMicrosoft also had some leaks of\nthe mobile variety this week. After the\ndecidedly lackluster launch of Windows Mobile 6.5, some leaked mock-up comparison shots of WM6.5 and 7\nsurfaced. Instead of the same old \u2018Windows 95\u2019 style interface we\u2019ve come to\nexpect, WM7 looked downright touch\nfriendly. Microsoft best be pushing\nhard to get the seventh iteration of\nits mobile operating system out of the\ndoor asap, otherwise it might just find\nthat the market space it once had has\nbeen swallowed up by Android.\nApple of course couldn\u2019t let Microsoft take all the limelight this week, entering the press with a refresh of their\nconsumer level computers. First up we\nhad a \u2018new\u2019 iMac, which to be honest isn\u2019t all that new except for bigger\nscreens and some Core i7 love. What\nApple thinks it\u2019s playing at with no BluRay support in a $2000 machine is anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe little brother of the Mac world\nalso got some love with a spec bump\nand the release of a Mac Mini Server,\nwhich is something people have been\nusing Mac Mini\u2019s for, ever since they\nfirst released them. The white polycarbonate MacBook also got a kick in\nthe pants with bumped specs, an integrated \u20187 hour\u2019 battery and an LED\nbacklight. Why anyone would buy one\nof these over the marginally more expensive 13\u201d MacBook Pro is beyond\nme, but I guess there must be some.\nAfter a suit from the owners of the\nMighty Mouse patent, Apple went\nahead and changed their whole mouse\ndesign concept. The Magic Mouse,\nyet another crappy name, dispenses\nwith things like buttons and scroll\nwheels/balls and moves everything to\nmulti-touch. Normal mousing is still\nperformed by moving the thing, but\nscrolling and clicking are done through\nthe touch sensitive surface. Ok, the\nMighty Mouse wasn\u2019t a great mouse\nfor any extended use but is this thing\nany better? It doesn\u2019t even feature rechargeable batteries. I guess well have\nto see what the public\u2019s reaction to it is.\nFinland this week pushed forward a\nlaw to make broadband internet access\na human right. What this will mean for\nthe whole \u2018disconnect the file sharers\u2019\nmovement to tackle piracy is anyone\u2019s\nguess. For more on the subject Feroz\nhas got a spiffing article for you over\non the right.\nAlso this week Ben, our very own\nfelix photographer, takes a look at the\nnew drool worthy Canon 1D Mk VI,\na must read for anyone interested in\nDSLRs. The 1D is something that most\nof us wish we could buy but simply\ncan\u2019t afford it. If however you\u2019re the\nkind of person with an enormous trust\nfund and a penchant for photography,\nhit me up at the usual address.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nThis week Spotify announced a deal\nwith 3 to bundle it\u2019s music subscription service in with mobile phone con-tracts. In a move that essentially locks\ncustomers into a two year subscription\nwith Spotify, 3 users will get all you\ncan eat music in a similar fashion to\nwhat Spotify has made available on the\ndesktop. Spotify is not the first to offer\nmusic subscriptions as part of a mobile\nphone contract. Both Vodafone and\nNokia have similar services, but Spotify\u2019s brand for music and availability on\nthe desktop might make this a winner.\nSpotify is also looking to push the service out to many platforms and carriers\nafter starting with the UK\u2019s most open-minded network 3.\nMore mobile news this week from\nSamsung who introduced the Samsung\nBlue \u2018eco-phone\u2019. The outer shell of the\nnot unattractive handset is made from\nrecycled plastic bottles. Shame about\nall that silicon and metals in the circuit\nboards but it\u2019s a start right?\nDVD-Jon is back again this week with\nan update to his iTunes replacement\nDoubleTwist. The update re-enables\niPhone syncing, which, with the recent\nannouncement that DoubleTwist is\ngoing to get an Amazon MP3 store in-tegration, makes it a worthy competitor to, what at least on Windows, is a\nrather unwieldy piece of software.\nunsuspecting users without even a little bit of warning, resulting in Firefox\nblocking the plugin assuming it was\nmalware. Microsoft threw up a hissy-fit when Google announced Chrome\nFrame an add in for IE saying it was a\nsecurity risk yet they do the exact same\nthing to your Firefox installation.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Hotmail was also in\nthe spotlight this week for blacklisting the NHS for 7 days. For the second time addresses ending in nhs.uk\nwere blocked by Microsoft resulting\nin many patients and candidates failing to receive important emails and\ndocuments. As the world\u2019s third largest employer, the NHS has a lot of ad-dresses, which play an important role\nin both patient care and administra-tion. If you haven\u2019t already, maybe it\u2019s\ntime to make something else other\nthan the aging Hotmail your primary\nemail account.\nThe WiFi alliance this week announced the WiFi Direct certification\n, which in effect replicates the direct\nconnection facility that BlueTooth already provides but with much higher\nbandwidths. Think of it as a beefed up\nad-hoc wireless profile with easier and\nfaster direct connections between de-vices. What this will mean for the up\nand coming BT 3.0 standard is anyone\u2019s guess, but for now, low power\ndevices that use BT are unlikely to be\nA\ns you read these very words,\na digital revolution is oc-curring. All over the world,\npeople young and old are\nwaking up to a new era of user-centric-ity and unparalleled performance. Ok,\nok, before this turns into a nauseating\ntorrent of Microsoft marketing babble\n(or even worse, another Launch Party\nvideo) let\u2019s cut to the chase: Windows\n7 is here, so let\u2019s get the lowdown on\nwhat it means for me and you.\nTo the untrained eye, Windows 7\nwill, for many people, be very reminiscent of Vista. There are still lots of\nshiny Aero Glass and transparency ef-fects, and the core features like Windows Explorer and the Start menu\nremain mainly unchanged. However,\nthere have been numerous more subtle changes that could take people a\nlittle while to get used to. The first is\nthe new taskbar which is pretty much\na complete rip-off of Apple\u2019s dock.\nIt uses big, glossy icons to represent\nprograms instead of the little rectangles we\u2019re used to. It does this regardless of whether or not they\u2019re open or\nnot, providing a place to \u2018pin\u2019 favourite\nprograms in place of the now-removed\nQuick Launch bar. They\u2019ve also added\nseveral new features under the \u201cWindows Aero\u201d banner, including the ability to snap windows to the edges of the\nscreen and a big button to briefly hide\nall the Windows to see what\u2019s on the\ndesktop. All of this is shuffling around\nthe features we\u2019ve all actually had for\nages, but presenting them in a fresh\nand more user-friendly way.\nWindows 7 isn\u2019t just an old dog with\nnew tricks however, the majority of\nchanges that those crazy Microsoft developers have put into the new version\nhave been under the hood, providing\na myriad of performance-related im-provements. In benchmark tests on the\nWindows 7 release candidate it consistently out-performs Vista at pretty\nmuch everything, and in some cases it\neven does better than XP. It is usable\nsooner on boot, shuts down quicker\nand uses fewer system resources. In\nfact it does everything you\u2019ve always\nbeen able to do (and more) and it\u2019s had\na bit of liposuction to boot. A lot of\ncommentators suspect that Windows\n7 will quickly become the platform of\nchoice for hardcore PC gamers instead\nof XP, finally delivering the goods to\nelitists where Vista so sluggishly failed.\nThis isn\u2019t just good news for those of\nus with beefy tower computers though.\nWindows 7 has also been designed\nwith laptops, netbooks and tablets in\nmind, so anyone upgrading should see\na considerable performance increase\non lower-end systems over Vista. It\nmay not even matter if your laptop is\na few years out of date, as the system\nrequirements for Windows 7 have\nonly changed very slightly since Vista,\nrequiring only slightly more memory\nand a very slightly faster processor.\nThe graphics requirements remain unchanged and the amount of disk space\nyou\u2019ll need has in fact dropped by several gigabytes. Performance increases\nlike this could breathe a new lease of\nlife into old laptops and save the user\nquite a bit of money as previously\nbumbling hardware gains a spring in\nits step from Windows 7.\nSpeaking of money, you\u2019d expect to\nhave to pay through the nose for the\nnew version as is usual with new Microsoft releases. If you were anyone\nbut a student you\u2019d be right, with the\nretail Ultimate edition of Windows 7\nweighing in at a whopping \u00a3299.99.\nThere is a way for students to get it for\nconsiderably less however, and I\u2019m not\ntalking about BitTorrent. Everyone\nwith an \u201cac.uk\u201d email address (that\u2019s\neveryone at Imperial) can take advantage of the \u201cUltimate Steal\u201d offer which\nallows us to get the Home Premium\nversion for the low, low price of \u00a330.\nFor more information, check out:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/uk/\neducation/studentoffer.\nWindows 7 is set to become the new\noperating system of the moment for\nthe PC world. Whether you\u2019re ready or\nnot, odd\u2019s are that it\u2019ll start appearing\non Imperial computers in the future,\nso even though there are a few changes\nthat might take a while to get used to,\nin the long run, making the jump is\nsomething that is inevitable.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor Armed with pedal power the Trike can\ngo where the Street View cars can\u2019t and\nphotograph even more of the country.\nMind you, the Trike riders better keep\ntheir wits about them, riding around\nwith thousands of pounds worth of\ncamera equipment attached.\nWolframAlpha, the computational\nengine, released an iPhone app this\nweek. How much for the convenience\nof not going to the iPhone optimised\nsite? An extortionate \u00a330! I say thanks\nbut no thanks. The only useful thing\nI\u2019ve managed to get out of WolframAlpha has been the amount of vitamin C\ncontained in a lightyear3\nof strawber-ries. OK, not that useful.\nDell unleashed the new, anorexic\nAdamo XPS to the world this week coinciding with the Windows 7 launch.\nMeasuring in at a positively wafer like\n0.39\u201d thick and using a \u2018heat-sensing\nstrip\u2019 to automatically open the lid, this\nepitome of indulgence can be had for a\ncool $2000. Just don\u2019t expect it to encode that YouTube video of you farting\nin your mates face whilst he\u2019s passed\nout drunk in HD too quick OK?\nBeing a Windows week, Microsoft couldn\u2019t get everything right and\nin this case had its grimy mitts on\nFirefox. The Windows Presentation\nFoundation plugin was pushed upon\nupgraded with WiFi Direct.\nThis week, Google announced the\nStreet View Trike, showing that there\u2019s\nnowhere to hide from Street View.\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix FRIDAY 23 OCTOBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nThe Versus Round - Arkham Asylum\nThe latest part of the Batman saga is out, but is bat-tastic or a joker? Adam Omar and Nick Virago fight it out\nL\net\u2019s start with the positives.\nThe voice acting is spot\non. Most of the main cast\nof Batman: The Animated\nSeries is present, and they\ndo a good job. Special mention goes\nto Mark \u2018Luke Skywalker\u2019 Hamill,\nwho plays the Joker. His cackling voice\nspews such wonderful lines as \u201cTell\nme Bats, what are you really scared of?\nFailing to save this cesspool of a city?\nNot finding the commissioner in time?\nME! In a thong??\u201d\nThe art direction and sense of style\nand atmosphere are amazing, and\nthankfully they mimic the cartoon\nand the comics more than the recent\nmovies. The game engine, however, is\ncrap. No matter how many bloom and\nfog effects they smear on the screen,\nthe graphics never look good (from a\ntechnical point of view); it\u2019s sort of like\na Vauxhall with red paint and a Ferrari\nbadge. True to its console roots, textures are low-res and repeated ad in-finitum. No matter how high you turn\nup the resolution, it\u2019ll look crap without lots of anti-aliasing on and it\u2019ll run\ncrap unless PhysX is turned off. PhysX\ndoesn\u2019t really add anything anyway besides cloth-ier cloth and cobweb-ier\ncobwebs and foggier fog.\nNow we get to the meat (or rather,\nthe rotting maggot ridden carrion) of\nthe game, the gameplay. You will spend\na large portion of your time in Arkham\nAsylum running down look-alike corridors and beating up groups of thugs.\nThis is where things fall apart. One\nbutton is used as an all-purpose attack\nbutton. You cannot control exactly\nwhat he does; you can merely point in\nthe rough direction of an enemy and\nclick. It looks impressive in game, with\nBatman twirling and flipping like a true\nmaster, but all the player will have to do\nis left click, left click, left click. Rightclicking activates your counter move,\nwhich you only press when you see a\nblue sign, quick-time-event style. You\nhave absolutely no control over what\nBatman actually does, only whether\nor not he does it. There is such a large\ndifference between your control inputs\nand what actually happens in the game;\nyou might as well sit on the mouse and\nlet your buttocks play the game. The\ncherry on the proverbial excrement\ncake is the unskippable slow-motion\nscene you have to sit through each time\nyou kill the last enemy in a group.\nThe combat, although horrible, isn\u2019t\nnearly as infuriating as the \u2018Detective\nMode\u2019. The detective mode lets you see\nthrough walls and makes evidence and\nimportant items glow bright\norange. also highlights\nnearby ene-mies, and displays such\nuseless information as: \u20182 hostiles detected, 1\nunarmed, 1 armed\u2019. Yeah no shit, Sherlock. As if I needed to press a button to\nget that bit of information, as opposed\nto, you know, simply counting the\nnumber of enemies on screen and having a look at whether or not they\u2019ve got\nweapons? Once in a while the player\nwill have to use the \u2018evidence scanner\u2019\nportion of the detective mode. The\nevidence scanner is basically like a bad\npoint and click adventure game \u2013 scan\nevery pixel till you find the object that\nglows. Not exactly prime detective\nwork.\nA word about physics. I find it perplexing that this game completely\nwasted many many good physics-y op-portunities. More development time\nshould have gone to the grappling\nhook, rather than the cape.\nOther gripes include the Riddler\ncollectibles strewn about the game\nworld \u2013 obviously a cheap way to\nextend game time, though they do\nbreak the immersion somewhat.\nThe checkpoint save system is\nalways a bad idea, no matter\nwhat game it\u2019s in. It\u2019s especially annoying here since\ncheckpoints aren\u2019t where\nyou expect them to be,\ne.g. the start of each\nlevel not being a\ncheckpoint. Also, a\nflock of black bats\nappear and fly towards the top left\ncorner of the screen\nevery time you gain\nexperience. All this\nexperience you get\nis used to purchase\nability and equipment upgrades,\nwhich seems a bit\nodd, since it\u2019s essentially Batman paying\nhimself for his own stuff.\nAlso, the batarang infinite ammo and auto-aim removes any\nneed for skill.\nBatman Arkham\nAsylum is an utter\ndisappointment.\nThere\u2019s a sense\nthroughout\nthe game that\nit could have\nbeen so\nmuch bet-ter, if only\nit hadn\u2019t\nbeen designed to\ncater to\nthe lowest\ncommon\nprimordial\nooze de- nomi-nator. The grime at the\nbottom of your bathtub\ncould play it. The game\nis just too easy,\nand far too\nauto-mated. It really\nis the equivalent\nof watching a Batman movie while randomly\nclicking away on your mouse\n\u201c...left click, left\nclick, left click...\u201d\nOpinionated bastard?\nWrite for Versus - simply smash\nyour keyboard angrily in the\ngeneral direction of\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhere are two types of great\ngame. There are games\nwhich innovate, but stum-ble. Games like the flawed\nARMA 2, a game riddled\nwith gigantic, fun-ruining bugs, which\nis still great because it communicates\nits vision of large-scale, beautifully-realised warfare. Then there are games\nthat refine. Games that take a template,\na well-established style, and build it\nfrom the ground up, fixing the prob-lems, enhancing the good bits, polishing and sanding down a genre. Step\nforward Batman: Arkham Asylum, the\nlatest beautiful refinement of the third\nperson action adventure.\nThe aim here was clearly to sew together the good bits of being Batman\nand chop off the bad. Combat is a\ngreat example - it eschews fiddle button combinations, instead preferring\nto keep both eyes and brain locked\nto the screen, asking you to choose\nthe next target. This removes the\nneed to memorise a keyboard lay-out, and instead neatly emphasises\nthe need to keep an eye out for\nthreats. You\u2019re Batman. You\nknow how to do a reverse-up-percut-ollie-crotchgrab.\nSo you\ndon\u2019t need\nto worry\nabout it - in-stead, you\u2019re\nwatching to see who\u2019s\ngot a gun, who\u2019s running to\nalert the others, who\u2019s getting ready to\nlunge in with a kick. You know, superhero stuff. Stuff that makes your chest\nbulge and your biceps break out of\nthat smelly, unwashed t-shirt.\nThis is the key - WWBD? If Batman would do it, add it in. That\u2019s\nfun. If he wouldn\u2019t, chuck it. Because the odds are that those things\nare gamey and dull.\nSo stealth, say, isn\u2019t a case of alarms\nand view cones and countdowns and\nsnore, snore, snore. You\u2019re the fucking Batman, right? Death shadow?\nAngel of darkness? You grapple into\nthe shadows, and you\u2019re gone. To\na gamer, that sounds like an easy\nway out, oversimplifying the game\nmechanics. But the goons are still\nthere, the puzzles are still unsolved,\nthe objectives incomplete. And ul-timately, you\u2019re still very weak, and\nvery prone to Bullet In The Face\nsyndrome. No, the grapple-tastic\nfreedom doesn\u2019t make the game\ntoo easy. It just makes you a\nbit more like Batman. Are\nyou noticing the pattern that\u2019s forming\nhere?\n\u201cTight\u201d and \u201cSolid\u201d are the words\nyou\u2019ll hear describing this game. It\u2019s finessed,\npolished, the graphics are well-rounded without demanding you\nupgrade the old box in the corner.\nThe UIs give you exactly the information you need - no more, no less. That\ntakes careful design. The voice acting\nis well-directed, full of life and yet not\noverused and annoying. It\u2019s an elegant\nbalancing act of a game, and a joy to\nplay as a result.\nAnd it\u2019s not a classic, alright. Let\u2019s get\nthat straight. Batman isn\u2019t going into\nthe history books here no matter what\ntalk you hear of \u2018Game of the Year\u2019.\nBecause Batman doesn\u2019t innovate, it\u2019s\nhappy just to do a job and do it well.\nThe hublike layout of the eponymous\nasylum is straight out of a mid-nineties\nplatformer, and there are boss fights\nwhich - yes, Dara - require you to do\nsomething three times before victory.\nIt\u2019s true. But being content with doing\na good job isn\u2019t a bad thing.\nIt all gels together so well, it all connects up in such a beautiful way, and it\nwants you to play it. It does. It remembers that challenge in games shouldn\u2019t\nbe like an end-of-term exam, but like\na kickabout in Hyde Park with some\nmates. You\u2019re having fun, while displaying a skill. You\u2019re not performing\nstrict instructions under the threat of\npunishment. You\u2019re mucking around.\nYou want to lure twelve goons into an\nepic fist-fight? Do it! Or pick them off\none by one and hear them scream and\nget paranoid. Smear exploding glue on\nthe walls. Do what you want.\nIt\u2019s a toybox, through and through,\nand that\u2019s a good thing. The challenge\nmodes, for instance, are all about getting better at the balletic combat - not\nabout the memory, but about the feel-ing. About being the powerhouse, the\niron-clad motherbitch without needing to fiddle around with a gamepad or\nlook up the best moves online.\nIt can feel a little counterproductive at times, but Batman\u2019s sense of\nfreedom and character is a strength,\nnot a weakness. The game is a linear\nthing, and some elements are laughably last-year. But it sets out to do one\nthing - deliver on the license. And after\na string of terrible, terrible games that\nare supposed to support a franchise of\nsome kind, Batman is the first one in a\nlong, long time that actually manages\nto convey the material it\u2019s based on.\nWhen I first played Batman, I was\ninitially put off. It seemed overblown,\nand I\u2019m always hesitant when people\nstart declaring something to be this\ngood.\nBut Batman really is special.\n\u201c...you are\nthe goddamn\nBatman...\u201d\n\n"

Nothing\nshouts \u2018cool\u2019 louder than outright lazi-ness. Make sure your absense is noted\nby everyone. This may involve turning\nup to the end of the lecture and shout-ing, \u2018SORRY I\u2019M LATE. I WAS BUSY\nNOT GIVING A SHIT ABOUT THIS\nCOURSE!\u2019 Then walk straight back out\nTip 3: (FOR THE GUYS) Don\u2019t moan\nabout the male-to-female ratio. This\ndoes not bother you! You actually came\nto Imperial for a challenge. You\u2019re tired\nof scoring so much pussy and your dick\nneeds a holiday.

I\nsometimes think they\u2019d look less horrified if I told them that I thought that\nholocaust didn\u2019t happen (Great icebreaker by the way).\nYou have to remember that most\nImperial students sit on top of the\nclass pyramid and shout to the commoners below, \u201cDance for me plebians\nand sniff my organic shit! That smell\nis descended from lords. LORDS!\u201d\nThere is a strict criteria for middle-class television viewing; if Jeremy\nPaxman or Stephen Fry aren\u2019t on the\ncredits then it\u2019s working-class.

If\ncatching a ball and running into people is your ideal sport, then rugby is for\nyou!

If they still don\u2019t believe\nyou, bring a breath-a-liser or blood-testing kit. They NEED to know that\nyou\u2019re drunk.\nTip 10: If you\u2019re watching a film in\nyour common room, or just with a\ngroup of friends, alert them when a\nfunny bit is coming up. It\u2019s your job to\ntell them that it\u2019s funny and prepare\nthem for the gag.

As would be expected, large\ndemonstrations have been planned to\ncoincide with the episode\u2019s filming.\nThe protestors wish to criticise the\nBBC for its decision to reward the Party\u2019s success at the European elections\nwith increased coverage and publicity.\nThe BBC\u2019s Director-General, Mark\nThompson, has defended the BBC\u2019s\ndecision by arguing that \u201cIt remains\nthe BBC\u2019s obligation to scrutinise and\nhold to account all elected representatives and to do so with due impartiality.\u201d In common with anyone writing a\nnews article on the BNP, BBC journalists benefit from a generally accepted\nright to express their own opinion of\nthe Party through their reporting. Even\nwhen a sentence is expressed in a way\nso as to sound impartial, this is done\nin a comical and mocking tone that\nwould be completely unacceptable if\nthe news was about almost any other\nparty.\nFor this reason protestors concerned\nonly about the racism issue should\ntake a chill pill. No one who does not\nalready support the BNP is going to be\nconverted by hearing Nick Griffin explain how the physically- and intellec-tually-superior indigenous majority is\nbeing colonised by minorities. On the\nother hand, almost a million people\ndid support the Party at the last elec-tions. It is highly doubtful that most of\nthese people are genuinely racist and\nit is widely acknowledged that many\nof them cast their votes purely in protest at the fumbling, expense-claiming,\nmainstream parties.\nClearly racism has not been enough\nof a barrier to these people opting for\nthe BNP. Luckily for the rest of us, the\nParty itself offers dozens more as yet\nunder-publicised reasons not to vote\nfor it. This begs the question of why\npresumably well-informed political activist types would not want Mr Griffin\nto rant before the whole nation against\nthe evils of respected military Generals, supermarkets, the services sector\nof the economy, private property and\nso forth. Secret racist sympathies and\ncynical attempts to gain popularity by\nsitting MPs aside, the motivation for\nthe political organisers of such protests\nis clear.\nFascism was always been known as\na particularly vile creature of the hard\nLeft. Amazingly, the likes of Hitler\nand Mussolini have since then been\nincreasingly portrayed as \u2018far-right\u2019.\nA second look at their actual policies\nshows that this is nothing more than\nthe tactic of changing word meanings,\nas popularly warned against by George\nOrwell. Semantics may not seem to\nbe on the same level of importance as\nthe political issues of the day, but this\ntactic has been highly successful in the\npast. For an especially amazing exam-ple, think of the word \u2018regulation\u2019. It\u2019s\nmeaning has been turned upside down\nin order to reverse the intentions of\nthe US Constitution\u2019s framers. They\nused it unequivocally to mean \u2018to keep\nregular\u2019 whereas it is now pretty much\nthought of as meaning \u2018to interfere in\nand impede\u2019.\nAlthough it is difficult to know\nwhere on the traditional left-right\nspectrum to put policies such as ridding the NHS of its administrative staff\nand restarting the war on the IRA, the\nBNP still sits squarely to the left of Labour. It draws most of its supporters\nfrom the ranks of Old Labour voters\ndisillusioned with their former Party\u2019s\nBlairite drift towards the centre. It espouses policies such as compulsory\nworker-share ownership, protectionism and the re-nationalisation of great\nswathes of the economy.\nAt first it may appear ironic that the\nflyers advertising the protest around\ncampus mention as their partner organisation within IC, the Socialist\nWorker Student Society, or SWSS (yes,\nI checked, that is a real society and yes,\nI asked, it is not meant to be satirical).\nThis may seem almost as laughable\nas the idea of putting on a big demonstration against the BNP receiving\npublicity. In fact, it is entirely to be\nexpected. No-one within the political\nmainstream can seriously fear Mr Griffin turning the nation racist through\nhis rational debating skills on Question\nTime. The likes of Peter Hain and the\nSWSS on the other hand have every\nreason to fear the broadcast of most of\ntheir views, sprinkled with some casual racism that in fairness they clearly\ndo not share, on national television\nthrough the voice of Nick Griffin.\nReview of the week\u2019s business news\nInvestors are continuing to flee USD\namid growing signals of increased\nbroad-money inflation. Speculation\nthat China and oil producers are\nreconsidering their commitment to\nthe world\u2019s reserve currency has been\nfuelling the exit. This is leading the\ncharge into commodities, dragging\nthem right out of their December\n2008 lows. Eyes are strongly focused\non gold, which will need to reach\n$2000 before regaining its inflation-adjusted 1980 peak. Commodity\nexporters have seen their currencies\nappreciating significantly. Meanwhile,\nrising equities are generally not being\naccompanied by increasing optimism\nas the nominal gains are being put\ndown to the weakening Dollar. US\nTreasuries have remained strong amid\ngrowing suspicions that the Fed may be\nbuying them up.\nThe Federal Reserve has decided\nthat threats to the supposed recovery\ntrump long-term inflation fears. It has\nreduced the target rate for overnight\nlending to 0-.25% in response, and\nis claiming that this is contributing\nto rising demand for US Treasuries,\nalongside a flight to \u201cquality.\u201d\nExpectations that China will act to\nstop the Dollar sliding too far, both\nto support its exporters and because\nit owns $800 billion, are limiting the\ndamage of this policy.\nFactors counting against the claim\nof rising demand for Treasuries include the weakening USD, the trillion\nDollar deficit and the record US debt.\nSuspicions are falling on the Fed being up to no good, as usual. Instances\nof it distorting various securities markets in the past are well documented.\nThe incentive to make Treasuries look\nmore popular is clearly visible. The\nFed\u2019s consideration of political factors\nis known to be higher either side of\nimportant nominations, as in this case\nfor Chairman, Ben Bernanke.\nThe stakes are now even higher as\nsupport grows for two Congressional\nbills that aim to remove restrictions\non the Government Accountability\nOffice\u2019s ability to audit the Fed. These\nbills now both enjoy strong bi-partisan\nsupport, enough to override a presidential veto in the House. Senior Fed\nstaff have been scrambling to win over\nthe 75% of Americans who say they are\nfed up with the Fed. There now seems\nto be a tactical shift from threatening\nsurging inflation to trying to show that\ninvestors still trust the system. Recent\nfederal judgements against Fed exemption from the Freedom of Information\nAct may shed some light.\nWhen the Senate Finance Committee\npassed the latest version of the\nhealthcare Bill, it claimed bi-partisan\nsupport after Sen. Olympia Snowe,\nR-Maine, voted with the Democrats.\nThemostcontroversialoftheproposals\nhave been considered unlikely to pass\never since August\u2019s townhall meetings\nshowed where public opinion stands.\nThe original Bills would probably have\nbeen filibustered by Repubicans and\nmoderate Democrats. Far from being\na backstabber, Senator Snowe may\nhave taken one for the team by offering\nthe Democrats an opportunity to\nsave face whilst withdrawing most of\ntheir important demands. It is worth\nnoting that the Committe did not need\nSnowe\u2019s vote to get the Bill passed 14-9. If Senators such as Blanche Lincoln\nside with Republicans in the final vote,\nSnowe may yet join in fillibustering.\nAsset markets continue recent trends What\u2019s the Fed up to now? Demand for Treasuries defies weakness of the Dollar Snowe may not be a traitor\n\n"

Canon is aiming its latest and greatest squarely at\nthe demanding sport, journalism and\npaparazzi (aka the professional stalker\nmarket).\nHeadline features include a whopping ISO 102,400 (making stalking\npossible in complete darkness), Full\nHD 1080p movie mode (so you can\ncapture your victim\u2019s movements in\ncrystal clear HD), 100% frame coverage (a feature shared by the new EOS7D) and a new 45-point TTL autofo-cus. The package is as with all previous\n1Ds, encased in Canon\u2019s pro-standard\nrubber-sealed magnesium alloy body,\nwhich means it can take a knock or two\nand won\u2019t crumple into a mess when\nit gets knocked out of your hands by\nsome pissed off celebrity/footballer/\nex-girlfriend.\nBuilding on the 1D\u2019s three previous\niterations (and their s and N variants),\nCanon have listened to the cries of\nthe pro photographer. The result is a\nthe new AF system (with 39 of the 45\npoints being cross type at f/2.8), full\nfeature customization, the ability to\nadd copyright data to images straight\nout of the camera and Canon\u2019s new\nspot AF feature \u2013 a precise pinpoint\nfocus mechanism.\nFollowing the 1D\u2019s generational slimming program the Mk IV weighs in at\na svelte 1.1kg, which compared to the\nMk I at 1.6kg is a marked improve-ment. The 1D Mk VI also bests its current competition from Nikon, the flagship D3s, which weighs 1.2kg. Canon\nhas also made some subtle ergonomic\nchanges which should improve an already excellent grip with the proven\n\u2018elephant\u2019s arse effect\u2019 texture covering the main portion of the vertical\nand horizontal grips making even the\nsweatiest palms stick to it like glue.\nFrom an aesthetic point of view the\nonly thing that could be a miss is the\nfact that without the rather small \u2018Mark\nIV\u2019 text you\u2019d struggle to tell it apart\nfrom the Mk III, but in this photographer\u2019s opinion that\u2019s not such a bad\nthing. An interesting feature is the ability to configure the Autofocus points\nseparately for landscape and portrait\norientations allowing for super-fast\nframing switching, which should cater\nwell to those suffering from paranoid\ncomposure indecisiveness.\nIn line with most other recent\nDSLRs, the Mk IV supports full HD\n1080p recording at 30, 25 and cinematic 24fps along with 720p at 60 and 50\nfps. As we\u2019ve seen in the past HD video\nshot with the kind of quality lens that\u2019s\noften attached to a DSLR really stands\nout from even the better consumer\nHD video cameras. Canon have also\ngiven the user full manual exposure\nwhilst video recording meaning that\nthe 1D moves still cameras one step\ncloser to offering a serious challenge\nto dedicated pro video cameras. The\nlack of proper autofocus during recording however means that amateurs\nwill stuggle (and fill YouTube with videos of out-of-focus pets in a matter\nof days), but in the hands of someone\nwho knows what they\u2019re doing you\u2018ll\nsee some really fantastic video come\nout of a 1D and it certainly 1-ups the\nNikon D3s.\nSo if you\u2019ve got a spare four and a\nhalf grand for the body only (yes that\u2019s\n\u00a34500) and a passing interest in photography or fancy yourself an amateur\npaparazzi, it might be worth checking\nthis one out.\nFancy some Nooky?\nThis week has been a good week for\neBook readers. Barnes & Noble, an\nAmerican book store, has taken the\nfight to Amazon with it\u2019s newly announced nook eBook reader. Heralded\nas \u2018the most advanced eBook reader\u2019\nthe nook sure does have some stand\nout features.\nFirst up it\u2019s packing Android (yes,\nyou heard right, Google\u2019s open-source\nmobile operating system). Whether it\u2019ll\nbe able to run Android apps is however\nnot known, but chances are that some\nenterprising hacker will put together\nsomething for it even if Barnes & Noble\ndon\u2019t.\nSecondly, it\u2019s got two screens. The\nnow standard 6\u201d diagonal, 16-lev-el gray scale, E-ink display, is\nbacked up rather unusually by\na secondary colour touchscreen LCD below.\nThe problem with\neBook readers\nsuch as the\nAmazon\nKindle and the\nSony eReader have\nbeen that, quite frankly, their user\ninterface sucks. The technology behind\nE-ink displays which produce high\ncontrast and low power consumption\nalso produce a tediously slow refresh\nrate. This means that anything moving like a UI is frustrating to use on\nan E-ink display. That\u2019s where Barnes\n& Noble hope the nook secondary capacitive touchscreen comes in. Navigation, selection and all operations are\nin theory, a lot easier on a LCD touch-screen, even if it is just a small strip at\nthe bottom.\nFor storage the nook features 2Gb of\nmemory built in, plus a microSD card\nslot for expansion, so there\u2019s plenty of\nspace for all your books. Competing\ndirectly with Amazon\u2019s Kindle, the\nnook has GSM based 3G wireless for\naccess to the Barnes & Noble book\nstore for on the go book purchasing\nand downloads. WiFi is also available\non the nook although it\u2019ll be limited to\nonly working in Barnes & Noble stores\non launch. On the bright side Barnes\n& Noble will offer book browsing on\nthe nook inside their brick and mortar\nstores ,via WiFi, that will allow you to\n\u2018stream the book\u2019. This will give you access to the whole book as long as you\nstay in the confines of the store. It\u2019s an\nattempt by to replicate the experience\nof browsing and buying paper books in\nbrick and mortar book stores, something that a lot of readers feel that\u2019s\nsorely lacking with eBook readers.\nTo further simulate the physical book\nexperience, B&N have built in book\n\u2018lending\u2019, a feature by which you can\nlend any LendMe branded book to another\nnook\nowning\nfriend. It\u2019s\nat the discretion of the publisher whether this\nis enabled on a per\nbook basis, but Barnes\n& Noble are pushing for as\nmany books as possible to be\npart of the service.\nBattery life on the nook is rated at\n10 days of reading with the wireless off\nwith a full charge reached in 3.5 hours.\nThe nook also plays mp3s with a built\nin mono speaker or headphones jack.\nOn the format front, the nook supports various documents and image\nformats including ePub and PDFs. For\na majority of people PDF support will\nbe a boon especially for those looking\nto read text books or papers in digital\nformat, something Amazon tried to\ncapture with it\u2019s Kindle DX.\nAll in all the Barnes & Noble nook\npromises to be a major step forward in\neBook reader usability and with a $259\nprice tag it might even be affordable.\nWhether it will make it over to the UK is\nanyone\u2019s guess, but with Amazon pushing their \u2018International\u2019 Kindle in the run\nup to Christmas, it wouldn\u2019t be too far\nfetched for the nook to follow suit.\n\u201cUK placed 25th\nout of 66 countries\nfor broadband\u201d\nBroadband internet access to become human right for forward thinking Finns\nLast week, Finnish lawmakers passed\na law that entitles all Finnish citizens\nto 1Mbps broadband. The law, which\ncomes into force in July 2010, is part\nof a broader Finnish broadband policy\nthat should eventually see 100 Mbps\ninternet being a legal right by 2015.\nThis comes at a time when a growing\nnumber of mainland European countries have begun classifying internet\naccess as a human right, meaning that\nit is the responsibility of each country\u2019s\ngovernment to provide internet access\nto all it\u2019s citizens. The situation in the\nUnited Kingdom, however, is rather\ndire.\nAs Imperial students, we are used\nto exceptionally fast internet by UK\nstandards. On a wireless network in\nthe library, you can get speeds up to 20\nMbps. A wired connection in residences on the South Kensington campus\nreaches speeds of ~95Mbps. Yet the\nsituation just a block away from campus is very different. A recent survey\nof global broadband quality placed the\nUK 25th out of 66 countries surveyed\nwith UK broadband qualified as \u2018meeting the needs for today\u2019 and nothing\nmore. South Korea, the leader in the\nsurvey, along with other Far East Asian\nand Scandinavian countries, is already\npromising all it\u2019s citizens 1 Gbps internet by 2012. The Digital Britain Report\n2009, presented to Parliament, only\naims to achieve 2 Mbps countrywide\ninternet by 2012, 500 times slower\nthan Korea and 50 times slower than\nwhat Finland is aiming for only three\nyears later.\nBroadband accessibility isn\u2019t just\nabout speeds, however. Basic modern\ninternet delivery infrastructure hasn\u2019t\nbeen created yet in the UK. Apart from\nVirgin who are pioneering their optical fibre network, all truly futureproof\nbroadband options in the UK are still\nunder construction. The situation is\nset to improve in the near future, but\nthere is a long way to go before we\ncatch up to the likes of South Korea.\nprofit margins depend upon quick information transfer. The London stock\nexchange is planning a major systems\noverhaul to cut transaction times from\n2.7 ms to 0.4 ms, which is a good indicator of how important speed is with\nrespect to technology. Positioning the\nUK as a leading country in terms of\nbroadband proliferation could attract\na sizeable amount of investment. Of\ncourse a useful by-product might be\nthe next time you move, the wait for\nyour broadband line might be a little less. I\u2019m currently pinching my\nneighbour\u2019s WiFi signal while I wait\ntill BT decides to activate my home\nconnection.\nFeroz Salam\nFeroz Salam Technology Reporter\nBT received the go-ahead for it\u2019s new\noptical fibre network this March, the\nconstruction of which will only be\ncompleted in 2012.

The plan\nis part of the government\u2019s\nefforts to stop militants from\nattacking oil installations in\nthe Delta, which has had some\nrecent successes after an amnesty was reached with leading militants. If the\nlocal community benefits from increased oil output, it reckons, pressure will\ngrow on the militants to forgo violence. The rebels say they are fighting for a\nfairer share of oil revenues.\nPresidential adviser Emmanuel Egbogah told the UK\u2019s Financial Times that\nthe money would go directly to communities, bypassing powerful state gov-ernors. The plan could see more than 50bn naira (\u00a3207m) diverted to local\ncommunities in its first year.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nLast Friday, Pakistan sent 30,000 troops into the lawless regions of\nWaziristan in a long-awaited offensive against the Taliban based\nin the region. The Pakistani troops, who are well supported by helicopters and fighter jets, face an estimated 10,000 Taliban fighters,\nand another 1,000 foreign militants, mostly Afghans and Uzbeks,\nwho are operating in the region. Over 80 Taliban have already been\nreported killed in combat, whilst the Pakistan Army has suffered a\ndozen casualties.\nThe ground offensive follows two weeks of brazen attacks by the\nTaliban on key locations, including military headquarters and police\nstations in major cities. Western diplomats say that a Pakistani victory against the Taliban on its side of the border with Afghanistan\nwould significantly help the NATO coalition fighting the Taliban in\nAfghanistan. The Pakistani army will being drawing on its experience\nin the Swat valley, where it successfully ousted the Taliban earlier this\nyear.\nPakistan\nLast Saturday, a gunman in\nRio de Janeiro shot down\na police helicopter, killing\nthree policemen and spurring violence which has left\na further 21 people dead.\nThe helicopter crashed to\nthe ground, erupting into\nflames, after the pilot was\nshot in the leg. Military police\nin Rio have begun a manhunt\nto find the assailant, but gang\nviolence in the city, which has left thousands of people dead in the past dec-ade, continues to be a problem. The violence has renewed concern amongst\ninternational observers about Rio\u2019s preparedness to host the 2016 Olympic\nGames. Brazil\u2019s President Lula pledged to do everything to combat the out-of-control gang warfare in the city. The President also promised an additional\n$58m (\u00a335m) to deal with the violence and provide the police with bulletproof helicopters.\nBrazil\nNigeria\nBiomedical Engineering the best\nImperial\u2019s Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBE), announced on Monday that it is this year\u2019s overall winner\nof the Times Higher Education (THE)\nAwards in the category of \u201cOutstanding Contribution to Innovation and\nTechnology.\u201d These were the fifth annual THE Awards, considered the\nmost important awards ceremony for\nthe UK\u2019s higher education sector. For\n2009 there were over 600 entries from\nmore than 130 institutions.\nThe panel of judges said that the IBE\nwas being recognised for the \u201cbreadth\nof its innovation\u201d in the areas of medical diagnosis and treatment, personalised healthcare, regenerative medicine\nand biomedical imaging. The panel\nwas also impressed by the transferabil-ity into other fields of the Institute\u2019s\nresearch.\nCommenting on the award win, Professor Christofer Toumazou, Director\nand Chief Scientist of the IBE said:\n\u201cWe are extremely proud to receive\nthis special honour from the preeminent awards in the higher education\nsector. Our ambition at the Institute\nis to deliver breakthrough advances in\ntechnology that enable people to lead\nindependent lives despite illness, ageing and disability, and we are thrilled\nthat the innovation and leadership\ndemonstrated by the entire IBE team\nhas been recognised in this way.\u201d\nThe IBE opened its new state-of-the-art, purpose-built facilities in 2006.\nIt aims to combine the strengths of\nImperial\u2019s research in engineering\nand medicine, particularly to achieve\nfaster commercial realisation of research outcomes. It focuses on the\nintersections between the platform\ntechnologies in science and engineer-Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian News Reporter\ning, including systems biology, materi-als, imaging and nanotechnology, and\nmedical applications, such as bionics,\nbiomechanics and tissue engineering.\nAnn Mroz, editor of Times Higher\nEducation, said of the winning entry:\n\u201cImperial\u2019s contribution to innovation\nand technology is simply too large to\nbe ignored. The projects from the Institute of Biomedical Engineering are\ntransforming lives in an enormous\nrange of pioneering ways.\u201d\nBiomedical Engineers get up to their winning antics in the Bessemer Building\nImperial\u2019s school meals for Africa\nThe Partnership for Child Development at Imperial College London has\nannounced a new project to help African farmers provide healthy school\nmeals. The project is supported partly\nby a \u00a37.2 million grant from the Bill &\nMelinda Gates Foundation.\nThe Partnership for Child Development (PCD) is part of the Division of\nEpidemiology, Public Health and Primary Care at Imperial College London.\nPCD is a global consortium of civil society organisations, academic institutions and technical experts who aim\nto improve the education, health and\nnutrition of school-age children and\nyouth in low and middle income coun-tries. The plan is to help governments\nmanage school meals programmes\nmore effectively. Many of these are already in place in Sub-Saharan Africa,\nbut suffer from a range of problems.\nMost are run by international aid agen-cies, mainly using imported food. The\nhope is to replace this with local pro-duce, thus providing a regular and reliable income source to farmers.\nThe new initiative will work in conjunction with education, health and\nagricultural sectors, social workers\nand international development part-ners, such as the World Bank and the\nWorld Food Programme. The idea is\nthat replacing a one or two ineffective organizations with a partnership\ninvolving many, will improve the child\nhunger situation.\nProject leader Dr Lesley Drake believes this will provide a double-blow\nto poverty by helping both schoolchildren and farmers, \u201cBy putting school\nfeeding programmes using locally-sourced food in place, we can ensure\nthat the smallholder farmers who supply the food get a reliable income that\nhelps them look after their families and\nimprove their businesses. We want to\ngive them the skills and know-how\nto shape their own futures and beat\nSina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian News Reporter poverty.\u201d\nDr Drake argues further, \u201cmillions of\nschool children are facing poverty and\nhunger every day. For many of them,\na school meal is the only reliable, nutritious meal they get each day and it\nis often the reason they go to school.\nGetting an education is really important for these kids, as it helps them to\nget jobs and break out of the poverty\ncycle. We hope our new project will\nhelp governments make sure these\nchildren are fed and educated.\u201d\nThe first trials will be in Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi and Kenya. The\nproject will be conducting a series of\nstudies to analyse the cost and impact\nof its own, as well as similar, initiatives.\nIt has been made possible through\nfunding as part of the Bill & Melinda\nGates Foundation Agricultural Development initiative, which is working\nwith a wide range of partners to provide millions of small farmers in the\ndeveloping world with tools to boost\ntheir yields.\n\n"

May\ncontain splinters. Not recommended when in extremis.\nANDREX, LUXURY QUILTED TOILET TISSUE (6 pack)\nWhile not as soft as wiping yourself on the brown-furred puppy with which it is advertised, its\nsoftness quotient is still high. A very nice paper.\nJOHNSON & JOHNSON, BABY WIPES (Tubs of 200 sheets)\nA trip down memory lane and particularly useful for the more messy encounters. Have some\nof these on hand should you require help, if still drunk the next day -- your friends will thank\nyou for it.\nPLENTY, KITCHEN ROLL\nOften a last resort when nothing else is available. As the advert says, this is extremely\nabsorbent, and so useful for those days where little food has been ingested. Be careful of\nseepage. We do not recommend that you wring these out for reuse.\nREADING MATERIAL\nSee point 3. (left), I recommend anything by Dan Brown.\nKITCHEN SCRAPS\nTypically consisting of orange rind, potato peelings, mouldy celery, yoghurt pots, etc. These\nare the economical choice. If using, try to select large fruit and vegetable matter to avoid\ngetting your hands dirty. Rims of yoghurt pots can be particularly helpful.\nLIDL, BUDGET LOO ROLL\nFrankly, you may as well just use a handful of road grit.\nI\nt is that time of year that a lot of\ndrinking takes place. When you\nfactor in the vindaloo on top of\nthe pints, cocktails and/or glue-sniffing, you will need to take care of\nyour body the day after your bender, as\nit will be delicate.\nYour first priority must be sanitation.\nTo that end (ahem), I have prepared\nthe following points to help you with\nthe weeks ahead.\n1. When nature calls, you will often have very little warning, and time\nwill be of the essence. Make sure you\nknow in advance where the nearest toilets are to your room and any lecture\ntheatres. Give priority to those facilities where the impact of your activities\nwill be less on others. Loos which have\nfewer cubicles or that are less popular\nare preferable.\n2. Try to estimate when you are going to need to expel the excesses of\nthe previous night. Make sure friends\nare warned so they can be elsewhere.\nBe discreet: if you are leaving behind a\nhazardous environment and someone\nappears to be about to enter it, stop\nthem and say \u2018Br\u00fcnhilde wants you\non line two.\u2019 They will know what it\nmeans.\n3. Take reading material. This will\nkeep you occupied in the event that\nyou must spend longer than you in-tended. Also, given that you may have\ngone to bed only a few hours before,\nyou do not want to fall asleep and wake\nup with Maintenance breaking into the\ncubicle to find you splayed out on the\nfloor with your underwear round your\nlegs, dribbling.\n4. Toilet paper. It is very important\nthat you invest in decent material.\nSince you will probably need to make\nseveral unpleasant visits a day, using\nthe freely provided material can easily render your backside raw, possibly\neven bleeding. Naturally this is exacerbated if you had a plate of Madras or\na kebab with too much chilli sauce the\nprevious night. Below I have reviewed\na few options which you may like to\nconsider.\nLastly, you must check supplies, and\nmake sure not to get caught out by\nfinding that you have been left with\nnothing but cardboard. If this situation\ndoes arise, here are your options:\na) call for help;\nb) soak the cardboard from the roll\nin the cistern of the toilet until it splits\ninto sheets: if you\u2019re frugal with it, you\nmay be able to get by with just this;\nc) Sit on the floor and pull yourself\nforwards along the floor with the balls\nof your feet like a dog with an itchy\nanus. Turn back every few seconds to\nsee when the brown streak has run out.\n(N.B. The last of these is really very\ndisgusting. Don\u2019t actually do it.)\nPaper trails:\nthat morning\nafter feeling\nDavid Stewart woke up and everything felt fairly normal, then came that impending feeling of doom down below\nIt looks nice there, but I bet your burning bumhole tells a different story\n\n"

Bit of a pisser, really, as I was\nlooking forward to seeing the 2010\nMMO. I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s going to be\na big launch next year; the merging of\nthe GTA concept with the MMO ideal\nhas the potential to be huge, as well as\nextending our idea of what an MMO\ncan actually be.\nActually, combined with The Old\nRepublic, the Star Wars MMO that\nclaims to be story-led, the year ahead\nlooks like it could be a landmark one\nfor online gaming. With APB transforming how we think about competi-tion, quests and ranking, and TOR using Bioware\u2019s significant track record\nfor narrative to try and drag the singleplayer experience into the online\nworld, we might finally see the WoW\nmodel breaking up and fading away.\nIt\u2019d be good, because while games\nlike Champions Online show that the\nbasic WoW format has a lot of variety\nto give, if we don\u2019t start to innovate\nsoon there\u2019s a worry we might stagnate\nand be stuck like this for another ten\nyears. WoW is all well and good, but\ngames like EVE Online show that we\u2019ve\nnot really begun to explore what online\ncommunities can do when they\u2019re given a game world to live in.\nTalking of potential, I revisited the\narchive of the Experimental Gameplay\nProject the other day, hoping to catch\nup on their back catalogue. It\u2019s still going strong - the idea is that a bunch\nof developers create games, on their\nown, in less than seven days. They\npick a theme each month, and release\ntheir efforts as they announce the next\nmonth\u2019s theme. Played World of Goo?\nCanabalt? Crayon Physics Deluxe? The\nEGP is where it all began.\nThere\u2019s a fierce sense of creativity\nhere, in every game submitted. There\u2019s\nsomething about tight deadlines that\ngives a sense of freedom to proceed-ings, and that\u2019s what creates this amazing idea, realised in a short space of\ntime so as to expose the idea without\ngetting it smothered with \u2018additional\nfeatures\u2019.\nIt\u2019s exciting to play what they\u2019ve got\non offer there (you can get involved\nyourself, too) with some stellar ideas\nappearing out of nothing in a very short\nspace of time. But I can\u2019t help wanting\nto get involved myself. Any Felix readers taken part in the project? Any Felix\nreaders interested in doing so? Get in\ntouch with us - games.felix@imperial.\nac.uk. I\u2019d love to hear from you.\nThis week we continue with our review of the decade, have a Batman fa-ceoff, and more. Enjoy the issue, and if\nyou got an APB invite - don\u2019t tell me.\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nTen Long Years - 2001\nA\nh, 2001. It was a very good\nyear (but not, as we shall\nsee, as good as 2002). We\u2019re\nback on the reminiscence\nroad, tracking our way to the present\nday and reflecting on the years that\nmade us the gamers we are today.\nAww. Ain\u2019t that nice?\nLet\u2019s kick off with probably the most\nbizarre story of the year - Uri Geller suing Nintendo. Apparently he\nclaimed that a Pokemon character was\nmade to look like him. Wishful thinking on his part, I guess.\nOn the releases front, though, 2001\nwas a serious year. Red Faction hit the\nPlayStation 2 with the promise of destructible environments and a new age\nof technology in gaming, a promise it\nwould wait nine years to fulfil properly\nin Red Faction: Guerilla.\n\u201cMax Payne is such a classic. Maybe\nit wouldn\u2019t stand up to today\u2019s standards but when I first played it, and last\nplayed it, it blew me away.\u201d Owyn says.\n\u201cForget the action - which is immense - it\u2019s all\nabout the story,\npresentation and\natmosphere for\nme. It effortlessly\ncreated an\ninteresting\nand dark\nworld that\nyou always\nwanted\nto know\nmore\nabout,\nand delve\ndeeper into.\nLove that\ngame.\u201d\nMax Payne\nwasn\u2019t the\nonly hit that\ncame out of\nRockstar that\nyear, however.\nThis was the\nyear that\na legen-MaxPayne,GrandTheftAutoIIIandsomegamecalledHalo.Aquiet\nyear,then-joinusaswecontinueonourtripthroughthelastdecade\ndary game series began - again - with\nthe launch of Grand Theft Auto III.\nThe game which changed millions of\ngamers. Adam, for one:\n\u201cGTAIII made me an explorer, in a\nway that no previous game could. Blazing around Liberty City pounding past\nstunt jumps and stuffing hidden packages in my pockets kept me going \u2018til I\nMax bloody loves my editorials. Look at him. Glued to the page so he is\nknew that city better than the real one\nI lived in.\u201d\nIt also sold a metric fucktonne of\ngames, and secured Rockstar for the\nnext decade (or two).\nIt\u2019s a mixed year for the PlayStation 2.\nBlockbuster titles like Devil May Cry\nhit and become major selling points,\nwhilst niche, \u2018art\u2019 games like Ico supplemented the console\u2019s attack on the\nDreamcast with beauty and superior\ndesign. With Japan receiving Final\nFantasy X (we\u2019d receive it the following\nyear), it was an extremely good year for\nSony, one of the defining twelve month\nperiods for the console itself.\nWhat\u2019s interesting, as we look back\nat the last ten years, is to watch the\nrise of Activision, now part of the largest publisher around, ActiBlizzard. In\n2001 Activision purchased Treyarch,\nwho would later go on to develop the\nCall of Duty franchise that was a key\npart in their rise to power.\nIn the latter part of the year, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Halo released,\nsparking a furious Christmas as the\nXBox hits stores. Both MGS2 and\nHalo were defining moments for gam-ers, as the graphical promise of the\nnext generation began to show in the\nbig-name games being released. Metal Gear Solid 2\u2019s intricately detailed\nscenes looked beautifully cinematic\nat every turn, while the first-person\nemphasis on Halo enhanced the large-scale sci-fi warfare and made it all the\nmore visceral.\nHalo, in particular, represents for\nmany the beginning of a whole new\ntype of gaming - online multiplayer.\nXBox LIVE (which at this point was\nstill 12 months away) was to blow the\nPlayStation2 system out of the water\nsoon after its launch, requiring far less\nsetup and investment than Sony\u2019s attempt to wring money from the play-ers. Halo was poised to become an\nonline hit, serving huge numbers of\nplayers and setting it up for an inevitable sequel a few years later.\nThe humble Gamecube had a good\nChristmas showing, too - Pikmin and\nSmash Bros. both made an appear-ance, although the Gamecube launch\nstill seems lackluster when compared\nto the XBox\u2019s strong showing back in\nthat year. The Gamecube\u2019s strongest\nofferings were still to come, however.\nAnd lest we forget, 2001 was a Peter\nMolyneux year. In what was to be his\nlast cock-up before he finally made Fable, Black and White was released to\ngreat aplomb in the press, prompting\nAndrew to experience the following:\n\u201cI bought into the hype for this game\nentirely, as well I might, being 13. I\nwas gleeful as I got my baby giant ape,\nastonished at the building-destructo-phyics, frustrated by the gesture recog-nition, bemused as to why my creature\nwas becoming evil and filthy despite\nme only teaching him water-giving\nmiracles, and gave up partway through\nthe second island because I was bored\nas FUCK. Didn\u2019t play it after a week.\u201d\nConan had a different experience,\nthough, so maybe we\u2019re being too hard\non Pete:\n\u201cI find it to be a strangely pleasant\ngame to play. Almost relaxing.

Due\nto an unfortunate hair dyeing accident at the week-end, I now look like I am\nbeing sponsored by easyJet. You might\nhave seen me walking around campus\n\u2013 I am quite hard to miss. Yes, I am\nsuffering from the terrible Gingervitus!\nNow I have temporarily joined their\nranks, I did some research into \u2018Gingerism\u2019, the discrimination against red-heads, and found out that last November, a Facebook group with over 5,000\nmembers caused outrage by organising\na \u2018National Kick a Ginger Day\u2019. This\nkind of unwarranted prejudice should\nhave no place in our modern society,\nso why oh why does the BNP exist (see\nwhat I did there!)?\nThis week must have also been an \u2018interesting\u2019 one for 16,000 BNP members\nwhose names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers were leaked online last week. This is the second time\nin a year this has happened, and this\ntime round it seems membership has\ndropped compared to the last list. Also\nrevealed was the claim that the BNP had\nover 100,000 members, made by party\nleader Nick Griffin, whose details were\namongst those released, was a blatant\nlie, achieved by adding a \u20181\u2019 to the front\nof the sequential membership number.\nGriffin has had a very \u2018interesting\u2019\nweek. Last Thursday, was the news\nthat the BNP\u2019s constitution was deemed\nracist by the UK\u2019s equality watchdog.\nNo-shit-Sherlock moment there! What\nmade me laugh was that because of\nthis, it has to be revised to allow nonwhite members to enter the party.\nLaugh-out-loud!\nThen this Tuesday, he pissed off the\nArmy. Not the best idea really is it\u2026\nFour former Generals put their name to\na letter saying racist right-wing groups\nwere tarnishing the forces\u2019 reputation.\nWhat they were referring to, amongst\nother things, was the use images of\na Spitfire, a red Poppy, and Winston\nChurchill in BNP propaganda, including their website. Griffin is also commonly seen in photos using the \u2018V for\nVictory\u2019 sign (personally, I like to think\nthat he is just telling himself to fuck\noff). It is sadly ironic that Griffin models himself on our great wartime leader,\nwhen he spent his time in office fighting\nagainst these sorts of racist, supremacist ideas.\nWorst of all is the fact that Griffin said\nin 1998 that he was \u201cwell aware that the\northodoxopinionisthatsixmillionJews\nwere gassed and cremated and turned\ninto lampshades; orthodox opinion\nalso once held that the Earth was flat\u201d.\nHe had reached the conclusion that the\n\u201cextermination\u201d tale is a mixture of \u201cAllied wartime propaganda, extremely\nprofitable lie, and latter witch-hysteria\u201d\n.\nI would pay good money to see the ass-whooping Churchill would dish out on\nhim if he were still around today.\nBy the time you read this, Griffin will\nhave appeared on the BBC\u2019s Question\nTime program. In the run up to this,\nthere have been many calls for this to be\npulled, but I hope it has not been. This\nwill only be a further opportunity for\nhim to embarrass himself and his party,\nsomething he has proved to be very\ngood at. Go on, watch it, I dare you!\nEven if you know nothing about Politics\n(God knows I don\u2019t!) you will not fail to\nrealise how wrong his ideals are. That\u2019s\nnot an opinion - that\u2019s just fact!\nThink of the BNP as an embarrassing,\nannoying in-joke. Please try and keep it\nthat way. In May there will be a general\nelection. We all know there is a lot of\nshit flying around in Westminster at the\nmoment, but we must not let this be a\ncause for votes to be given to the BNP,\nnot in jest, not as a statement of being\npissed of at the current system. Please\nhelp keep them as nothing more than a\njoke.\nPhil Murray\nPhil Murray Politics Editor\nDutch MP Geert Wilders enjoys pushing his right to free speech to the limit\nWilders Arrives In UK\nLast Friday the Dutch MP Geert\nWilders came to London after successfully overturning a Home Office\ndecision to deny him entry into the UK\nin February this year. Mr Wilders has\nbeen the focus of much controversy\nover his radical views on Islam, which\ninolves his comparing the Koran to\nMein Kampf.\nIn February Wilders was invited to\nscreen his film Fitna in the House of\nLords by a UKIP peer, Lord Pearson,\nwhich was to be followed by a discus-sion. This started a protest from Lord\nAhmed, the first Muslim life peer and a\nmember of the Labour party, who was\nreported to say he would \u201cbring a force\nof 10,000 Muslims to lay siege to the\nLords if the campaigning anti-Islamist\nDutch MP Geert Wilders was allowed\nto speak\u201d.\nLord Ahmed was successful in stopping Mr Wilders from speaking to the\nHouse, as upon arrival he was promptly taken to a secure room then flown\nstraight back to the Netherlands under\norders from then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith. Smith had declared Wilders\nto be an \u201cundesirable person\u201d and refused him entry to the UK under Regulation 19 of the Immigration (Europe-an Economic Area) Regulations 2006,\nan EU law allowing refusal of entry to\nindividuals if they are regarded as constituting a threat to public policy, security or health.\nAt the time refusing Wilders entry\nwas condemned by much of the media as it was seen to be appeasing the\nmilitant Islamists who are criticised in\nFitna. It also called into question free\nspeech, as Wilders\u2019 right to put forth\nhis views had been blocked due to the\nfear of the violence it might provoke\nfrom a tiny minority. In Britain the\nlaws of the land decree dictates that a\nperson has the right to free speech so\nlong as they do not incite racial or religious hatred. This is certainly something that Fitna attempts to do by effectively tarring all Muslims with the\nsame brush as those who had taken it\nupon themselves to destroy the World\nTrade Centre. Incidentally Fitna was\nstill screened in the House and viewed\nby roughly 30 peers without Wilders\nbeing present to explain his film.\nStill, just over 8 months later, the\nban on Wilders being allowed into the\nUK has been overturned by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to the\ndisapproval of the Home Office and\nLord Ahmed has been to jail for killing a man. Wilders was again invited to\nBritain by Lord Pearson to discuss his\nviews on Sharia Law.\nThe original plan had been for him to\ngive an open air news conference but\nprotestors promoting Sharia law arrived holding signs including \u201cWilders\ngo to hell\u201d \u201cIslam will be superior\u201d and\n\u201cFreedom go to hell\u201d.\nAs a result of the protestors, Wilders\nwas moved inside whilst protestors\nwere kept at bay by the police.\nSo on this occasion Geert Wilders\nwas allowed to express his views, his\nfreedom of speech was not suppressed\nand nor were the protestors, who\nWilders was more than keen to point\nout would not be allowed to express\ntheir views so openly under Sharia law.\nFollowing all the fuss that was kicked\nup around the banning in February\nin comparison to the events of this\nmonth, it seems that the government\nwould have played the situation far\nbetter had they just let the man speak\nand be ignored by everyone who\nknows that the Koran is not a \u201cfascist\nbook\u201d as Wilders puts it.\nThis would have left hardly anyone\nwho would care what he has to say, as\nTom Smothers once put it: \u201cthe only\nvalid censorship of ideas is the right of\npeople not to listen.\u201d\nJames Lees\nJames Lees Politics Editor\nThe Channel Tunnel is amongst assets to be sold under UK Government plans\nGovernment sells your loan and the Channel Tunnel\nIn a speech made by Prime Minister\nGordon Brown on Monday 12th October, it was announced that the Government is to sell \u00a316bn worth of assets, in\norder to bolster Public Finances. This\nis to shore-up the public purse after\nGordon Brown\u2019s terrible handling of\nthe economy, which is driving us deeper into debt and recession.\nSales could include Tote Bookmakers, The Dartford Crossing Toll Bridge,\nThe Channel Tunnel, The Student\nLoan Book, Urenco, & surplus state\nowned property. This is to avoid public spending cuts.\nPhil Murray\nPhil Murray Politics Editor Urenco, jointly owned between the\nDutch, German & UK Governments,\nis a supplier of material and equipment\nto the UK\u2019s nuclear industry, supplying\nenriched uranium to nuclear power\nplants & isotopes for medical purpos-es. The Government plans to sell its\n33% stake.\nAs the Prime Minister said, \u201cwe need\na deficit reduction plan that supports\ngrowth and jobs not one that snuffs out\nrecovery before it has started.\n\u201cRestoring public finance sustainability must be done in a way that\nsupports growth, not destroys it. The\nfailure to do so is the real risk of a lost\ndecade of austerity.\u201d\nThese announcements have drawn\ncriticism from both the Conservatives\nand the Liberal Democrats.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokes-man, Vince Cable, said the policy was\n\u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. In his own\nwords: \u201cwhat worries me about the\ngovernment proposal is that they\u2019re\nproposing to sell off in very depressed\nmarkets, under very depressed markets for land and for shares\u2026this is not\na good time to sell assets.\u201d\nA Conservative Party spokesman\nsaid: \u201cas any family knows selling off\nthings helps in the short-term and, given the state the country is in, is probably necessary but it is no substitute\nfor a long-term plan to get the country\nto live within its means.\u201d\n\n"

Nominated for a MOBO\naward in 1998 he was known to\nbe a close friend of Bob Marley,\nHe performed with the likes of\nJames Brown and sung \u201cHappy\nBirthday, Mr. president\u201d to Nelson Mandela on his trip to the UK in\n1992.\nStill Levi\u2019s new single, \u201cSo out of\nmy mind\u201d will have a hard time fighting for its right as genuine track rather\nthan a cookery related gimmick. His\nsingle and performance was a mixture\nof energetic self written and reggae\ncovers, whilst acts such as Damien\nMarley might be trying to revamp\nthe island style for a new generation Levi is keeping his music firmly to its roots (\u2026sorry)\nWithout a doubt watching him\nperform eradicates any question\nthat roots is a one trick pony, but\nI think it might be a hard sell to\nfight for shelf space with a somewhat dated reggae sound. As the\nfinal song comes round however\nand the scantily clad women take\nto the already crowded stage, I realize that with this man, you can\nnever be so sure.\nT\nyson Ritter, lead singer of\nthe All American Rejects,\nis like no front man I have\never seen. In all my years of\nattending anything from small local\ngigs to sell out stadium concerts I have\nnever witnessed a singer quite as en-trancing, unpredictable and, let\u2019s face\nit, downright weird as Mr Ritter.\nNot exactly what you would call a\ndevoted fan of the Rejects, I was curious to see how their hits translated\nfrom record into the live atmosphere,\nas well as get a chance to hear their\nlesser known work. Songs like \u2018Give\nYou Hell\u2019(a Top 20 hit in the UK singles\nchart), \u2018I Wanna\u2019\n, & \u2018Dirty Little Secret\u2019\nhad all of Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire danc-ing, whilst the ballads kept every member of the audience captivated by Tyson\u2019s\nsurprisingly pure and powerful vocals.\nBut more entertaining than their\nmusic by far were Tyson\u2019s on stage an-tics, which ranged from crawling onto\nthe stage on all fours Gollum style, to\nscreaming \u2018PULL MY HAIR B****\u2019 at\nan unsuspecting blonde female fan.\nThere was not a dull moment to the\nset, because he wouldn\u2019t let there be.\nThough not a band that will ever\nAll American Rejects\nLive\nAll American Rejects\nShepherd\u2019s Bush Empire\n14th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nmake it onto my top 5, I\u2019ll hand it to\nthe Rejects that when they get it right\nthen they are one of the better bands\nof their genre. But that\u2019s just it, they\nmight be great at what they do, but\nwhat they do (primarily poprock with\nmore than a touch of the E word) just\nisn\u2019t that great.\nI\nt\u2019s blindingly obvious, the lead\nsinger and songwriter of Neutral\nMilk Hotel, Jeff Mangum, is mentally unstable. He hails from the\nremote town of Ruston, LA and has\na slightly disturbing obsession with\nAnne Frank.\nHe is a recluse and the last time the\nworld heard from him, he asked everyone to help him save an antiquated\nmerry go round in Massachusetts.\nBut as per the clich\u00e9, as well as being mentally fragile he is also a bona\nfide musical genius, which results in a\nhighly interesting album. It\u2019s like a disturbed child creating brilliant art out of\nroad-kill.\nThe band described their sound as\n\u201cfuzz-folk\u201d fusing their earlier sounds\nas a noise rock band with simplistic\nmelodies and acoustic guitar chords,\nbut this album wasn\u2019t brilliant because of its genre splicing, it\u2019s the\nemotive level the band bring to the\ntable. The album jerks you through\ncountless feelings; euphoric happiness then hopeless loneliness then\ndesolate depression, all while showing\nyou the full state of Jeff Mangum\u2019s disturbed psyche.\nThe 8 minute long \u201cO Comely\u201d\nstarts with a simple strummed minor chord, with cryptically troubled\nlyrics; \u2018Oh comely, I will be with you\nAlbums that you should know\nwhen you lose your breath/With some\npretty, bright and bubbly terrible\nscene/ That was doing her thing on\nyour chest,\u2019 it continues to twist and\nturn through Mangum\u2019s demented\nscenes, but occasionally he shows you\na glimpse into his rational mind, revealing the true meanings of his lyrics,\nbefore falling back into his obsession\nwith the plights of Anne Frank. His\nlyrics make you feel that you\u2019re in the\npsychiatrist\u2019s chair, but the perfect delivery of his fanatical ideas will make\nyou question your own sanity. \u2018And\nwill she [Anne Frank] remember me\nfifty years later?/ I wished I could save\nher in some sort of time machine\u2019\u2026\nHugh Crail looks at modern classics that shaped music today\nNeutral Milk\nHotel\n\u201cIn the Aeroplane\nOver the Sea\u201d\n1998\nwill start to seem pretty valid, all\nthings considered.\nAs you may have guessed this album isn\u2019t easy listening, it\u2019s so visceral\nas to be uncomfortable at times, but\nit all comes from such a raw place\nthat trying to understand it becomes\nunbelievably rewarding. It is hard to\ncompare this album to any other, as\nit is unique and isolated from anything happening at the time, but it\nset a precedent for bands like Bright\nEyes and the Arcade Fire who brought\nemotionally laden folk music into the\n21st century mainstream, and I am\nbetting that they are hoping for a new\nNeutral Milk Hotel album as much as\nI am.\nLevi Roots\nJames Mossahebi tries some reggae sauce\nLevi Roots\nBush Hall, Shepherd\u2019s Bush\n19th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nMariam Zahedi gets weirded out and captivated by Tyson Ritter\n\n"

Even if you do tend to get stuck\nat Imperial there\u2019s plenty of culture\naround as I\u2019ve been finding on my progressively chillier journeys into college.\nAfter a year travelling the same route\nI\u2019ve become a little weary and so have\nbegun to occupy myself by playing\ngames. Aside from \u201ccount the leavers\nhoodies\u201d (seriously people, we know\nyou went to school otherwise you\nwouldn\u2019t be here, you don\u2019t need to tell\nus) I\u2019ve taken to playing \u201cspot the bue\nplaques\u201d. On my journey in I\u2019ve seen\neveryone from Dennis Gabor (inventor\nof holography) to composer Bela Bartok. This week I was surprised to find\nthat John Millais and Frances Bacon\nboth inhabited the same house near\nSouth Ken Station, although not at the\nsame time obviously. I\u2019d love it if they\nhad been around at the same time, I can\njust imagine them sat smoking pipes in\nthe living room around a roaring fire.\nMillais is telling Bacon to get a backbone and suggesting he tries painting\na pleasant landscape whilst Bacon is\ncriticising Millais\u2019 decision to shag his\ncritics\u2019 wife. Aww, artistic bliss...\nThis week we\u2019re concentrating on\ntheatre, but not of the musical variety.\nWe\u2019ve been sending our eager reporters to review the latest plays to hit\nLondon, and what a bounty to choose\nfrom. As an added bonus, I\u2019ve taken\na look back at this Summer\u2019s cultural\nhighlights and glimpse at what we\u2019re\nexpecting this season. Enjoy!\nLucy Harrold\nLucy Harrold Arts Editor\nS\no, maybe you\u2019ve never heard of\nTrevor Griffiths? Neither had\nI, maybe that makes us both\nphilistines, but maybe not.\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight, I am certainly enough of a cultural ignoramus\nnot to know whether I ought to know\nabout Trevor Griffiths.\nAnyway: Comedians. It sounds\nfunny doesn\u2019t it? It is, and it is also a\nhell of a lot more than that. A brief\nsummary sounded somewhat less\nexciting I thought; Six men from an\nevening class in stand-up do their first\nshow but find out some \u201chome truths\u201d\nin the process. Well maybe.\nHowever you can\u2019t judge a play by its\npr\u00e9cis and this piece directed by Sean\nHolmes is sweltering under the strain\nof making the phrase \u201chome truths\u201d\nan understatement. Home truths\ndoesn\u2019t come close to describing the\nbubbling turmoil that is a discussion\nof loyalty, craziness, sex, truth and\ndisillusionment.\nThe play is in three acts, first and\nlast being in a classroom and the\nmiddle calling a stage, a stage as the\naudience is victim to the debut acts of\nthe six aspiring comics. This straggling\ngroup of men who all desperately\nwant to follow their dreams into\nprofessional stand-up have been\nunder the guidance of Mr Waters\n(Matthew Kelly) and tonight they are\nbeing watched to see if they make the\ngrade. The question is whether they\nwill stick with the earnest old man and\nhis direction not to play to sexism and\nracism or abandon it to score cheap\nlaughs.\nThe play is absolutely dripping\nwith comedy actors including Reece\nShearsmith from League of Gentlemen\nand OMG! Lily Allen\u2019s dad, how\ncool(sorry, Keith Allen fans), who both\ngive excellent performances, but it is\nDavid Dawson who absolutely steals\nthe show with his amazingly electric\nperformance of Gethin Price. Dawson\u2019s\nenergy is terrifying, especially in the\nbizarre second act where Gethin, an\nangry, honest and bizarre man, does\nhis first stand-up. It\u2019s freaky, quite\nfrightening and unlike anything else\nin the play. This is the culmination of\nthe fabulously excruciating and funny\nsecond act, and displays Dawson\u2019s\nmind-blowing energy and expression,\nguaranteed to send the audience out\nbewildered into the second interval.\nAfter the amusing and more\npredictable first act, full of cute\ncharacter detail and ever-so-slightly\nuninspiring comedic philosophy, and\nleft aghast by the second, the third\nscene does not disappoint. Revelations\ncome tumbling out and cut deeper\nthan they had, tensions run high and\nKeith Allen shows off. Some \u201chome\ntruths\u201d are regrettably left hanging, but\nthe themes which started off tame and\ndry find their full meaning in dialogue\nbetween Dawson and Kelly. The young\nand old men argue and Dawson\u2019s\nstellar acting drives home justification\nfor the whole play. Ending with a good\nlaugh, it really is a funny play but that\u2019s\nnot the point, it\u2019s about why you laugh.\nYou should see it because although it\u2019s\nnot hilarious it is exhilarating.\nOMG! Lily Allen\u2019s dad in a play!\nRox Middleton treks to Hammersmith in search of Comedians\nI\nn a vague attempt to relive the\npast few months where the sun\nwould occasionally shine, exams were a distant memory and\nmost of us attempted to make as much\nmoney in as short a time as possible,\nwe take a look back at this Summers\u2019\nculture.\nThe big news in the arts world\nwas Anthony Gormley\u2019s \u201cOne and\nOther\u201d project on the fourth plinth\nof Trafalgar Square. Gormley\u2019s aim\nwas to allow a different person to do\nwhatever they liked for an hour at a\ntime- as long as it was legal.\nThe result was lots of people\nstanding still in the name of charity\nand lots of people getting naked in\nthe name of being a bit of an idiot. A\nfriend of mine was one of the lucky\n2460 to be selected and got to spend a\ndark stormy night throwing glowsticks\nto drunken louts; not my idea of a fun\nnight out.\nThe other big event for culture\nvultures was the Edinburgh Fringe,\nthis year hosting everything from\nDramsoc\u2019s own production of \u201cCrave\u201d\nto an audience with \u201cthat guy what\nstopped terrorists bombing Glasgow\nAirport\u201d (I kid you not). This inevitably\nlead to a barrage of plays arriving in\nvarious London fringe venues- look\nout for these as they provide a large\namount of the new writing coming to\nthe capital.\nIn other theatre news, \u201cToo Close\nTo The Sun\u201d opened and then closed\na week or two later. Sorry, but who\nthought that a four person with no star\nnames about the last hallucinogenic\ndays of Ernest Hemingway would\nsurvive in the summer season in a\nrecession?\nIn stunt casting news (yes, its\nso commonplace it gets its own\nnews section) - John Barrowman,\neverybody\u2019s favourite gay, is currently\ndragging up to play Zsa Zsa in La\nCage Aux Folles. Phil Jupitus will also\nbe partaking in a spot of women\u2019s\u2019\nclothing as the latest Edna Turnblad in\nHairspray.\nForbidden Broadway took to\nlampooning such behaviour in their\nshow at the Menier Chocolate Factory.\nTackling everything from Andrew\nLloyd Webber to the campness\nof Mamma Mia, they basically\nhighlighted everything I dislike in\ntheatre, way to go!\nA little closer to College the Proms\nsneakily ran at the Royal Albert Hall.\nMany complained that an evening of\nMGM classics was not what the Proms\nis about.\nI disagree, film music is a great way\nto get people into Classical music- I\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t have listended if\nit weren\u2019t for movies. Also, classical\nmusic shouldn\u2019t just be something\nfrom a hundred or more years ago, if\nwe stop recognising classics what will\nwe play our children?\nSo what was the cultural highlight\nof my Summer? A little gem of a show\nup in Highgate Village by the name of\nZanna Don\u2019t. A fun, poppy show but\nwith really deep emotion and a huge\nheart, it was Fringe theatre at its best-go Google it!\nAnd so to this year, what can we\nexpect? Well theatre-wise, pickings are\npretty slim as everyone seems anxious\nto open in a recession.\nMusicals-wise we have Annie Get\nYour Gun at the Young Vic starring\nJane Horrocks in the title role and the\nMenier Chocolate Factory is offering\nTamsin Outhwaite in Sweet Charity.\nOur only West End opening is Legally\nBlonde with Sheridan Smith and a\ncast of \u201cpeople off the telly\u201d from 5th\nDecember.\nOops, let us not forget Andrew Lloyd\nWebber\u2019s latest cash cow Tomorrow\nNever Dies, the sequel to Phantom of\nThe Opera, I will be aiming to forget it\nthanks. Hopefully Santa will bring me\nsome more musicals in my stocking at\nChristmas.\nStraight play openings are more\nabundant (possibly due to lower\nSummertime and the\nculture was easy...\nrunning costs and larger target\nmarkets). Big news for me is The Rise\nand Fall of Little Voice, not because\nof X Factor finalist Diana Vickers but\nbecause of Lesley Sharp and Marc\nWarren filling the roles played by\nBrenda Blethyn and Michael Caine in\nthe film version.\nAn Inspector Calls will be filling\nthe Spring Awakening shaped gap\nat the Novello Theatre for a limited\nrun. I\u2019ve heard good things about\nthis production although it has been\ntouring for years so may be a bit tired,\nlets hope I\u2019m wrong.\nWe\u2019ll also be seeing the Broadway\ntransfer of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, with\nDarth Vader himself; James Earl Jones.\nThe reviews for this weren\u2019t great\nand many are wondering why it is\ntransferring but it is classic storytelling\nthat will get bums on seats.\nKeith Allen showing off apparently\nLucy Harrold looks back at this summer\n\n"

Luckily it turned out to be\nnothing short of fantastic!\nSo I guess it seems that the more I\nworry, the better an event is likely to\nbe. (Maybe I should cash in on my ability to become nervous...). But, on Sunday 27th September 2009 at 7:15am, I\nentered SAF for the umpteenth time as\na 3rd year medic. Seeing two potential\nmedics already seated (having arrived\na good two hours before the show was\nabout to start), it really did put things\ninto perspective. (Wait, have I already\nmentioned how successful the event\nactually was?) Track back 48 hours\nwhen committee members were up\nuntil 6am finalising the details to be\nsent out to all the \u2018PotMed-ers\u2019. Or\ngo back a further week when Muslim\nMedics\u2019 pens were being bought and\ntwo thousand sheets were being print-ed. Or even a further 4 months when\nthe room bookings were being made.\nOn the day, everything just seemed to\nflow.\nSo, PotMed 2009 was the fourth of\nits kind. Just like its predecessors, it\nis an annual event hosted by ICSMU\nMuslim Medics society aimed at giving\npotential medical students a taste of\nthe gruelling application process and\nuniversity life in general.\nThe motto is simple: an event by\nmedical students for potential medical students. The one difference this\ntime round was the sheer number of\napplicants - almost 150 more than the\nprevious year! An amazing 250 pre-medical students turned up on the day,\neach looking to learn different things\nabout the application process.\nHaving been registered and shoved\ninto the lecture theatre by 9am, they\nwere told to spend the next 4 hours\nin there, just to get a flavour of actual\nuniversity life. Opening speeches by\nthe president and the adjudicator were\nfollowed by talks about life at various medical schools such as Leicester\nUniversity, King\u2019s College and Queen\nMary\u2019s.\nThese were followed by brief talks\nabout personal statements, communication skills, ethics and how to shine\nin interviews. It was great to see so\nmany of the students eagerly taking\nnotes throughout the morning, something that will no doubt be replaced by\nsleeping when they are finally medical\nstudents! The highlight of the morning session was definitely the keynote\nspeech delivered by none other than\nProfessor Karim Meeran. He described\nhis path to success and the basic \u2018do\u2019s\nand \u2018don\u2019t\u2019s of applying to medicine.\nJana:\nYou may be wondering what the committee was doing whilst the students\nwere in the lecture theatre. Truth\nbe told, not very much. However we\nall hung around nervously, shuffling\nsheets here, adjusting badges there, as\nwe prepared ourselves for the stampede of hungry 17 and 18-year-olds\nthat were to engulf the SAF foyer. And\nso at 1pm it began; volunteers were\nbeing organised and interview rooms\nwere set up. Lunches were served, doctors (for interviews) were dressed in\ngowns and questions by students were\nbeing cheerfully answered.\nThese same students needed to\nknow where to go in the maze that is\nthe SAF building, but all was not lost\nas they had a handy floor plan to fol-low. Somehow at 2pm everything was\nready. Ethics seminars had case reports\nprepared and were raring to go. The\nPersonal Statement Clinic had sufficient volunteers to match the demand\nof over-eager students. Tours left on\ntime and... I guess that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to\nsay about the tours.\nThe fourth rotation, the mock in-terviews, was the one everyone was\nreally anxious about. We were working to a very tight schedule and if everything didn\u2019t run like clockwork we\nwould have had an almighty disaster.\nSadly, no fireworks ensued. Everyone\nwas where they were meant to be at\nthe correct time and if any problems\nwere encountered, the SAF maps and\ntimetables were again at hand to solve\nwhatever it was that needed solving.\nThis was the case for the best part of\n3 hours, and by 5pm everyone had had\nenough.\nBeing heaved into the lecture theatre\nfor the last time, prizes were awarded\nfor the best mock interview performances and closing remarks were of-fered. The day finally came to a close.\nAt this point, I would very much like\nto thank all the volunteers that turned\nup on the day. Your commitment and\ndesire to help those entering the world\nof medicine cannot be appreciated\nenough. We would also like to thank\nthe Union for their contribution and\nguidance throughout the organisation\nof the event.\nSuper-organized as we were, feedback forms were provided for the attendees to fill in. Here are some of the\ncomments we received:\nYear 13 students:\n\u201cJust a short note to say thank you to\nthe whole team - PotMed was awe-some! There were a lot of things I\nwould never have picked up on or lines\nthat I wouldn\u2019t have thought of unless\nI went to something like this... Also\nthe students running it made it all the\nmore interesting and gave a more real\nview of what med life might be like...\nYes it was intense but never boring\nand I left with so much to work on and\nOne more PotMed leads to thousands more Medical Students\nUmar Chaudhry and Jana Kossaibati show us how a logistical nightmare becomes an application saviour\nimprove. I found PotMed fantastic for\ninterview preparation especially.\n\u201cThank you to all the Muslim Medics, you are all inspirational! PotMed\n2009 was great, not only enjoyable\nbut also very educational. Also got to\nmeet some ace people! So I am sure I\nam speaking for everyone when I say a\nhuge thank you to MM.\u201d\nGap year student:\n\u201cThank you very much for allowing me\nto take part in this year\u2019s PotMed. It\nwas eye opening, and I have learnt a lot\nabout the course of medicine.\nI thank you and your friends, for\nputting this on. It was truly a great\nexperience; I witnessed a community\namongst you.\u201d\nUmar and Jana:\nReflecting on the event as a whole, ultimately the most important thing was\nwhether or not the students benefited\nfrom the event. A vast majority of\nstudents did seem to think so. Hopefully, they can use the guidance they\nreceived that day to secure a place in\nmedical school, which was our ultimate goal.\nProceeds will be going to charity and\nwe hope that the Muslim Medics society can continue and build upon this\nevent to help even more medical students reach their potential in years to\ncome.\nYou too could be getting this situation horribly wrong sooner than you think\nMedical students always enjoy leaving the SAF\n\n"

From\nbeing found handcuffed, smashed off\nmy nut at 4am in Tesco trying to buy\nan iceberg lettuce, to befriending some\nof the best people possible, I\u2019ve probably done it all. Yet seeing this year\u2019s\nintake of solely 90s births makes me\nfeel a bit over the hill- and I\u2019m only 21.\nHowever at the same time it is amazing to see so many freshers getting involved this year. Observing the hockey\nclub, the group of boys and girls is the\nbest since I was a fresher!\nI\u2019m sure that all you freshers have\nbeen told this so many times before,\nbut I shall re-iterate. At Imperial you\nhave to work your balls off, or vaginal\npassage if you are of the female variety.\nAs a result you are going to have to let\noff some steam, i.e. distract yourself\nto forget about that project deadline\nor the shite mark in last week\u2019s test.\nWithout this distraction, I can assure\nyou that in no time you will burn out,\nturn in to a nervous wreck and people\nwill avoid you. I certainly will. Imperial knows this; why else is there such\na huge (over 300) range of clubs and\nsocieties? In fact, Imperial has the biggest number of clubs and societies of\nany university. Why else is there a free\ngym? Why else is the Union continually improving its facilities?\nI balance my time between working\non my degree (which always comes\nfirst), dealing with the ACC, playing\nhockey and then extreme laddish be-haviour- something that DPFS Jenny\nWilson is not impressed with. I think\nthat private study and my social life\nsees a 50:50 split in time. Over the\nsummer I work for a race team, if you\nhave 2 hours to change a steering rack,\nyou take 2 hours. If you\u2019ve only 30 min-utes, you bolt the fucker on in 30 and\ndon\u2019t bother to shine the spanner. It\u2019s\nthe same with work. If you have a day\nto write your essay, you procrastinate\nfor half of it, if you only have half the\ntime, you knuckle down and bash it\nout. The end result is the same.\nBasically freshers, what I am trying\nto say is don\u2019t let work get in the way of\nhaving a great time, but don\u2019t neglect\nwork. Balance your time. Remember\nyou are only a student once.\nStuff Imperial students like:\n4. felix:\nLets not beat about the bush, we all\nlove this humble newspaper.

They say that it\u2019s the news\nsections that provide the best beer\nsoakage to area ratio.\nMoving away from beer, and into\na more factual world, this paper has\nproduced multiple student journalists of the year, and we do all of\nthis for you- and what do we get in\nreturn?

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 23 OCTOBER 2009\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDoom and gloom on Graduation Day\nKadhim Shubber finds the class of 2009 facing the prospect of unemployment after graduation\nI\nn the summer of 2009, the UK\u2019s\nHigher Education Institutions will\nproduce 400,000 new graduates.\nThey will be entering the labour\nmarket at perhaps the worst time in a\ngeneration\u201d.\nThis damning verdict from the Confederation of British Industry perhaps\nmost bluntly sums up the employment\ncrisis that Imperial graduates find\nthemselves in.\nThey are by no means short of com-pany, it is estimated that graduate unemployment will rise by 22,000 with 1\nin 10 graduates destined to remain out\nof employment six months after receiving their degree.\nThe cause will come as no surprise,\nlarge companies, traditionally the largest recruiters of graduates, are reeling\nfrom the effects of the recession and\nhave as result cut graduate vacancies on average by 25%, increasing to\n56% for City-based investment banks.\nThere are simply less graduate level\njobs and this year\u2019s students are feeling\nthe pinch.\nBut the environment is not as clear\ncut as one might initially believe. The\nrecession has hit traditional graduate\nrecruiters like the City hard, resulting\nin heavy cuts in recruitment. This has\nheavily skewed surveys by, for example,\nThe Association of Graduate Recruiters which provided the above figure of\n25% and \u201cwhose members tend to be\nlarge companies that are more affected\nby the recession\u201d says Katherine Jensen\nof the HECSU.\nElspeth Farrar, Director of the Imperial\u2019s Careers Service believes that\nsensationalist stories in the press have\nworsened the position of many graduates by putting many off from applying\nfor jobs. A view that a HECSU survey\nshowed is shared by many university\ncareers services around the country.\nWhile, of course cutting costs, companies are still keen to recruit wherever\npossible, keen to avoid a repeat of the\n2001 recession where a sharp cutback\nin recruitment resulted in an \u201cemployment gap\u201d several years later.\nIn addition, many small- and me-dium- sized businesses are continuing\nto recruit, offering new, less traditional\nopportunities for graduates. \u201cMost\nstudents recite the same half dozen\ncompanies when they consider job\nopportunities, it\u2019s key that graduates\nlooking for jobs think outside the box\na little\u201d says Ms Farrar.\nMs Farrar is well aware that Imperial\nwill be affected by the fewer vacancies available but insists that Imperial\ngraduates are still \u201cwell-regarded in the\njob market\u201d and as a result are likely to\nfeel the impact of the job drought less\nseverely than the majority of other\ngraduates this year.\nMany students have chosen to continue in higher education in order to\nput off the inevitable plunge into the\njob market until the economic situation improves. According to Highfliers\nUK Graduates Careers Survey 2009\n26% of current final year students are\nplanning to continue in education.\nHowever with only 20% of employers\nplanning to increase recruitment levels\nin 2010 and a further 10% making further cuts, it is likely that students who\nput off entering the job market now are\nsimply delaying the problem.\nIt seems there\u2019s little else 2009\u2019s graduates can do but play the difficult hand\nthat the recent crisis has dealt them.\n26%\nPercentage of 2009 graduates\nplanning to continue in Higher\nEducation\n10%\nPercentage of 2009 graduates\nwho are likely to still be\nunemployed after 6 months\n25%\nCut in the number of graduate\nvacancies compared with\n2008\n2\n.47 million people are currently\nunemployed in the UK, of which\nI am one. Claiming benefits is\nnot something I saw myself doing when I started at one of the world\u2019s\nsupposed top 10 universities four years\nago. Sadly, it has been a necessity.\nA mix of complacency, lack of foresight and my own determination to\nstrive for the best grade possible ultimately led to this depressing situation.\nI was fixated on achieving a first. I\u2019d\ndone a summer placement in the city,\ngot the necessary experience beyond\nmy degree \u2013 or so I thought \u2013 and I\nwas solely focussed on getting the top\ngrade. Experience, grades, job. Simple.\nExcept the third part didn\u2019t go quite\nso smoothly. After three months of\nhaving numerous applications ignored\nor being told: \u201cyou\u2019re talented, but\nwe\u2019re not taking anyone on at the moment\u201d, I am at my wits\u2019 end. And I\u2019m\nnot the only one. Sitting in the Royal\nAlbert Hall this week listening to Dear\nRoy tell all the proud mums and dads\nhow sought after we all were was like\nlistening to the pitch of a dodgy dealer\nflogging his counterfeit wares. \u201cWhat\nare you up to at the moment?\u201d I asked\nthe graduand beside me. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d The\nsingle word lingers between us, \u201cnot\nmuch really.\u201d His reticence all too fa-miliar. One down from him, the next\ngraduand is just as apathetic. The two\npeople on my other side are also job-less. Whether they\u2019re claiming benefits\ntoo is not up for discussion.\nSo, here we are: today\u2019s world-class\ngraduates, tomorrow\u2019s waiters and\nwaitresses \u2013 if we\u2019re lucky \u2013 all being\ncongratulated on how lucky we are. But\nthis is gross deception spouted to stimulate our false egos. Bragging about\nleague tables, slapping the backs of the\nacademics who teach us so splendidly,\ntelling us how we\u2019ll change the world:\nit\u2019s all bullshit when the only change\nwe\u2019ll be making is collecting our tables\u2019\ntips for the next God knows how long.\nOn the dole\nwith a 1st\nAdvice for graduates Useful websites\nimperial.ac.uk/careers\nThe home of Imperial\u2019s Careers Advisory\nService with lots of information on\nupcoming events, talks and careers fairs.\nlondon.gov.uk/graduates\nSet up by Major Boris Johnson, ignore\nthe front page which is patronisingly\ndirect \u201cwhat can I do with my ___\ndegree?\u201d \u201cBalls all it seems,\u201d you might\nanswer.

Don\u2019t panic\nThis piece of clich\u00e9d advice is nevertheless quite useful. Don\u2019t run around\nlike a headless chicken; one well written application is worth 100 rushed\nones\n2. Network\nLord knows that Imperial students are\ngood at networking. Getting a job is serious business so don\u2019t be embarrassed\nto use every contact that you may have\nmade in the last four years to try and\nfind vacancies that you may not have\npreviously spotted.\n3. Get on the ladder\nThe world hasn\u2019t turned out as we expected it would, so adjust your expec-tations. If there\u2019s a job that interests\nyou, don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re \u201coverqualified\u201d. With some hard work, promotions will follow. Dead-end jobs are\nscary but quite unusual. Worst case\nscenario: find a new job later.\n4. Find out what went wrong\nFollow up unsuccessful applications to\nfind out what held you back from the\nposition. Maybe your interview technique needs improving. Use any criticism you get to improve your \u201cgame\u201d.\n5. Keep building\nThe job market is tough at the mo-ment. Don\u2019t let a year pass where the\nmost constructive activity you\u2019ve done\nis receive rejection letters. Develop\nyour knowledge and skills and take\nunpaid positions if you can to increase\nyour experience.\n6. Don\u2019t let travelling deceive you\nTruthfully, travelling is the graduate\nequivalent of an ostrich burying its\nhead in the sand (beach pun anyone?).\nWhen you get back you\u2019ll be competing with a fresh set of graduates and\nunless you go away for 5 years, the\njob market won\u2019t have improved very\ndramatically.\nAdditional reporting: Brigette Atkins\n\n"

Dylan Lowe reports on his one-week stay on Tribewanted, and how he learnt to live life to its fullest. And greenest.\nS\nickle as it was, the moon\nstill dazzled the waters\nwith a good dose of lustre.\nThe crackle of firewood\nharmonised with its scent\n\u2013 at least when I wasn\u2019t prodding the\nbonfire to revive the flames, only to\nbe retorted with blasts of smoke. My\neyes were welling, and droplets rolling down the cheeks fast. I shielded\nmy face from view.\nIt wasn\u2019t that I was eager to salvage\nmy dignity, or prove not to be a wimp.\nIt was because I genuinely felt like\nshedding a tear or two.\nThat moment conveniently amplified my disliking for leaving.\nI sought solace in my fellow tribe\nmembers \u2013 only a week ago we were\nscattered beings, linked no more than\nsome six-degree of separation. Their\nnames are now scrawled all over this\nbook I purchased earlier from the\ntribal market. This book, written by\nthe co-founder of Tribewanted, Ben\nKeene, depicts the author\u2019s personal\njourney in establishing the desert island community.\nFinal requests for songs were spent,\nthe kava in the tanoa running thin.\nWith electricity running scarce \u2013 we\nhad very little sunlight for the entire\nweekend \u2013 we abandoned the Grand\nBure and scattered for our drift-wood-made beds. I never quite made\nit to mine \u2013 staggering towards the\nbeach I found my spot, overlooking\nthe third largest reef in the world, on\nthe hammock.\nThey say a session on the hammock\ncan cure anything; it was my ideal\nremedy for all kava-related discomforts after all. But then, can it heal a\nheartbreak?\nI didn\u2019t, at the time, spare a thought\non that. Under the sweet, gentle sway,\ndawn seemed like a gazillion years\naway.\n*\nIf the name Tribewanted rings a\nbell, chances are that you have seen\nthe block letters smeared across the\npages of the Metro, or numerous\nother newspapers, back in 2006. This\ntourism experiment-cum-paradise\nis the brainchild of two young entrepreneurs and avid travellers, Ben\nKeene and Mark James Bowness, who\ndreamt of linking an online social\nnetwork with a real-life island community \u2013 people would meet online,\nparticipate with decision-making\nprocesses such as electing a monthly\non-island chief, before paying to visit\nthe island, named Vorovoro, in person\nand help build a sustainable village\nwith the local indigenous community\nas well as having the adventure of a\nlifetime.\nBetter summed up in Ben\u2019s own\nwords: \u201cMySpace with a real space,\nFacebook with a real face\u201d.\nThree years have passed by since\nnegotiating a land lease deal with local chief and landowner, the revered\nTui Mali. Has Tribewanted lived up\nto its expectations? When a devastating fire, super-cyclone, military coup\nand online scandals have all ravaged\nthe island but failed to deter it from\nbeing the success story it is today,\nperhaps it has.\nAnd so, as the conch sounded to\nmark Tribewanted\u2019s third anniversary on Vorovoro, Tui Mali graciously\nbestowed his approval on a five-year\nextension to the original lease. What\nwas designed as a three-year social\nexperiment project has now a much-longer future to look forward to.\nVorovoro Island itself is located off\nthe coast of Vanua Levu, the second\nlargest island of Fiji and northeast of\nViti Levu, the political centre of the\nPacific nation. This 200-acre island is\nhome to the indigenous Fijians, many\nof whom now live, work and play\nalongside visiting members and the\nmanagement team.\nAnd, not so coincidentally, the island I had opted to spend a week on.\n*\nOne could not claim to have struggled to fit in. Even though, upon ar-rival, my fellow island residents and\ntribe members seemed to be an inner\ncircle to infiltrate \u2013 they do know\neach other a lot more than I do \u2013 not\nknowing anyone was not a valid excuse for feeling alienated on Vorovoro. I was swiftly reminded that, from\nthe individuals who unloaded my\nrucksacks, the unfamiliar smiling faces quizzing me for names and origins,\nto our monthly chief Charlotte who\ngave us a tour around the island, and\neven Ben Keene himself who I had the\npleasure to meet, absolutely everyone\nhad been in my position once, daunted as I was, and gawked blankly into\nthe great unknown.\nThen interactions would spark,\neither by the roaring flames or with\nkava in your gut \u2013 or both \u2013 and your\nstatus as a complete stranger shamelessly stripped away.\nThis sense of community isn\u2019t just\nsomething Tribewanted advocates:\nmore importantly, it was the foundation stones the island \u2018tribe\u2019 was built\nupon.\nDon\u2019t let the President of the Hammock Society catch you exercising...

Besides that, I am really enthusiastic and interested in working for\nour faculty and you all ,this year!!So all\nI am asking for is your vote, for a better\nfaculty, and for new ideas to be placed\non the table!! I think it is high time we\nall made a new change to something\nbetter. ..\nBest wishes to everyone,\nApostolia Matraki\nElections and manifestos explained for you\nH\nardly three weeks into\nthe new academic year,\nImperial College Union\nhave opened the first\nround of elections for\nthe year 2009-2010. The Autumn elections will see the Union Council take\nshape in the form of 4 undergraduate representatives for each Faculty\n(Engineering, Medicine and Natural\nSciences), 2 GSEPS representatives, 1\nGSLSM representative and 1 non-fac-ulty representative.\nAn International Officer will be contested in this round of elections too;\nthe elected student responsible for\nwelfare and issues relating to the international community at Imperial.\nThe Trustee Board is also appointed\nby the student body by the way of elec-tions. It is the overseeing committee\nat the top of the Union. Big decisions\nmay have to be made here, but less\nfrequently.\nCouncil is one of the most important\ncommittees within the Union as the\ndecisions made by it affect every student on campus. Most importantly, the\nMembers of the Council are given the\npower to vote on decisions brought to\nthe Council. Giving this power to the\nwrong person could potentially have\nadverse consequences.\nCouncillors meet roughly once a\nmonth to discuss the overall direction the Union is going in. The people\nthroughout these pages will have to\ngive their views on this decision as well\nas many other important ones.\nBelow are their manifestos, ready for\nLet your voice be heard! As YOUR\nrepresentative of Department of Engineering in the Union Council, I will\nstand up for your opinion.\nBasically, the Union Council is the\npolicy-making body of the union,\nwhere everything starts and mat-ters. And my point is our department\nshould receive more money and more\nrights, so we can organize more fun\nevents, have an awesome uni life, and\nhave even better labs!!\nHow am I different? I am not afraid of\nsaying what I want to say\u2014regardless\nof what other members of the council\nmay think at first. I\u2019ve got nothing to\nlose for expressing your opinion. However, if I don\u2019t do it, I will lose myself. I\nlove engineering way too much to do\nbring it down.\nSo, in order to see a change, in order to see your goals for our department become reality, let your voice be\nLawrence Weetman Rikki Norris\nHey everyone, I\u2019m Zahra! So, why\nshould you vote for me...well for a\nstart, my vision is to enhance your\nexperience of studying engineering\nat Imperial, and make it a somewhat\nmore enjoyable experience. Of course,\nengineering is by far the hardest subject (obviously), and we have LOADS\nof work to do, but we need to find time\nto allow us to have fun. You can be sure\nthat I will help make your voices heard,\nand do my best to try and make sure\nthat we have more social events.\nSO PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!\nHi. I\u2019m Lawrence and I\u2019m a second year\ncomputer scientist. I was an Engineering Undergraduate Rep for Imperial\nCollege Union Council last year, my\nfirst year at Imperial. I have seen how\nthings are done, and taken part in debates and voting on important issues\nsuch as the splitting of the DPEW role.\nI am heavily involved in the Engineering Faculty Union (as well as being\nCGCA Officer for the Alumni associa-tion)and will use all of my knowledge\nand practice to represent Engineers\nproperly on Council, as well as keeping\nthem informed of what is happening\nin THEIR student union through the\nCGCU student media. I shall hold the\nunion to account whenever possible,\nand ensure that all decisions made will\nbe of the greatest possible benefit to\nstudents in the Faculty of Engineering\nMy name is Rikki and I am a third year\nChemical Engineering student. I am\ncurrently the Vice-President (Finance\n& Societies) in the City & Guilds College Union, as well as a member of the\nNew Clubs Committee. I also work in\nthe Student Activities Centre, where I\nhave good contact with the Sabbaticals\nand Union staff. I sat on Council last\nyear as an Engineering Ordinary Member, and was involved with the decision\nto split the old Deputy President (Edu-cation & Welfare). I feel that I should\nsit on Council again this year as I am\nvery experienced in most matters it\ncovers, and know that it is Council\u2019s\njob to hold the Sabbaticals to account-especially at a time when new positions exist.

She has co-founded\nCocomaya, the newest (and hippest)\nconfectionary shop of the moment.\nWomen of London have a new place\nto go and indulge. Cocomaya can be\nfound at 12 Connaught Street, W2.\nF\nor a person who holds such\nhigh office, she is amazingly\ndown to earth. Coming out\nfrom the turnstile, she gave\nus a little wave and apologised that she was a little late. She is\nnot wearing the bronze spiky tribal\nnecklace you almost always see on her,\nbut she\u2019s still very much the Etro girl\nyou\u2019d expect her to be. The love she\ngets from fashionistas all around the\nworld is down to this simple ethos, \u201cI\nlove my job. I love meeting people. I\njust feel\u2026 really lucky to be in the position that I\u2019m in.\u201d\nThat position is the fashion top\njob at the Daily Telegraph. The two-time British Fashion Journalist of the\nyear has her own fashion TV show\n\u2013 Hilary&Co, and also a quintessential space in the blogosphere. All this\nwouldn\u2019t have happened if she had\ngone and picked up a fossil brush first.\n\u201cI wanted to be an archaeologist but\nmy father wasn\u2019t going to support me\nthrough another 4 years of university.\nOne day he rang a local newspaper\nin New Zealand and got me a job. I\u2019d\nbeen there less than a week \u2013 and I\nknew journalism was absolutely something I wanted to do.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t a fashion journalist until\nshe was half way across the globe. After working in New Zealand and briefly in Australia, it was in Hong Kong\nthat fashion kicked in. \u201cI did Fashion\nand Features in Hong Kong for 4 years.\nI would go out to local factories and\nI\u2019d see these labels \u2013 Christian Dior,\nCalvin Klein, Yohji Yamamoto. Everybody. They make everything there\nfrom lingerie, ready-to-wear to knit\nwear collections.\u201d A bit like treasure\nfinding indeed. And the fun fuelled\nHilary\u2019s interest in reporting fashion.\nFactory visits may be a thing of the\npast as hundreds of invites flood her\ndesk every year. New talent as well\nas the magazine regulars all want her\npresence. Hilary admits that choosing\nbetween many young designers\u2019 shows\nis a tough decision, \u201cI keep my ear to\nthe ground. People say \u2018check this so\nand so out\u2019. And I try to check them\nout if they\u2019ve got a website. I also go\nto all sorts of student graduate fashion\nweeks, CSM or the RCA. I also go to\nthe NewGen shows during London\nFashion Week.\u201d\nOut of all the well established young\ntalent in the previous season, Hilary\nenjoyed Mark Fast, Mary Katrantzou\nand William Tempest\u2019s debut shows\nthe most. Catching Hilary\u2019s eye is all\nabout having a new perspective, \u201cMary\nwas particularly talented. I first saw\nher dresses at the LFW exhibition\nabout a year ago. Her designs were\ndresses printed with huge necklaces. It\nwas fantastic.\u201d When Hilary sees something she likes, she tries to help the\ndesigners out - putting them in touch\nwith people or referring them to a PR\ncompany. \u201cWhatever I can do really.\nI\u2019ll write about them in a blog or in the\nnewspaper.\u201d\nHigher up the ladder, established\nfashion houses are incredibly extrava-gant. In a BBC documentary, The Secret World of Haute Couture, Margy\nKinmonth visited Lagerfeld during a\nfitting for his upcoming Chanel show.\nWhen she returned to her hotel after\nthe interview, bags of Chanel gifts were\nwaiting for her at the check-in desk, as\na \u201cthank you\u201d for her visit to Chanel.\nDoes this generosity extend to other\nhigh-fashion events? \u201cI usually get a\nfew bunches of flowers. I always get\nflowers from Galliano and Lagerfeld.\nOccasionally I get some perfume or\nskin care products from Chanel.\u201d\nFashion recycles; the trend from the\n\u201880s gets a little facelift \u2013 the fur gets\na dye and the hemline gets a snip \u2013\net voila, the 2010 hip look. \u201cGoing to\nfashion shows are a bit like going to the\ntheatre. Even if I\u2019m not particularly excited by the clothes there will be some-thing. The shoes, the accessories...\u201d\nThree years ago in 2006, the Balmain\ngirls\u2019 silhouette was almost exactly the\nsame as the following years. It has always been about the rock, the studs\nand the sequined mini dress. In 2009,\nBalmain has become a phenomenon\n- Madonna wore their mini dress in\nher video, Rihanna, Beyonce, Victoria Beckham, Kate Moss and Jennifer\nConnelly were all spotted in Balmain\u2019s\nsequinned dresses or strong shoulder\njackets. \u201cWhat Christophe Decarnin\n(the Head of House) did was like an\nearthquake. An added shoulder pad\nhere, more braid, more crystals there,\nand the dresses become more elabo-rate. Carine Roitfeld and her daughter\nstarted wearing Balmain\u2019s pieces. All\nmodels liked Balmain\u2019s clothes as well.\nChristophe became a catalyst for ex-citement. And this is Paris, people are\nalways looking for something new. All\nthese little differences that have made\nthe impact the fashion house needed.\u201d\nThe only big difference between\n2006 and now is the price of a Balmain\nstyle jacket. While you might have had\nto fork out \u00a33000 to exhibit the runway\nstyle in 2006, these days Topshop or\nPrimark are not afraid to supply a replica from just \u00a318. About this, Hilary\nsimply said, \u201cI will never spend \u00a33000\non a jacket, never.\u201d Fashion is ephemeral and style is timeless, and Hilary has\nstyle in abundance, \u201cI\u2019m trend aware,\nbut I don\u2019t slavishly follow the catwalk.\nI try to interpret [the current trend]\nand, say, if a suit makes me happy, I try\nto communicate that to my readers \u2013 I\nwant people to like and enjoy fashion.\u201d\nMaking people enjoy fashion and feel\nhappy in themselves seems to be Hilary\u2019s mission. She created Ask Hilary,\na section in the newspaper where she\nsorts out all kinds of fashion dilemmas\nfor her readers. \u201cIt\u2019s also definitely not\nabout the need to be a size zero or to fit\ninto these jeans or the need to get into\nthese shoes.\u201d\nIn June, Vogue\u2019s Editor-in-Chief, Alexandra Shulman issued a letter to de-signers, including Versace and Prada,\nKawai Wong talks to Hilary Alexander, the award winning fashion director of the Daily\nTelegraph about archaeology, travel and being a \u201cfriendly\u201d fashionista\nGeorgia Jagger - one of Mick Jagger\u2019s\ndaughters - will join Kate Moss\nand Lily Cole as Rimmel\u2019s new\nspokeswoman.\nEly Kishimoto to design for high\nstreet giant Anthropologie\nEly Kishimoto is set to design his\ncapsule collection in line with the\nnew Anthropologies store opening\nin London, in order to attract the\neclectic London shopper. Already one\nof the most popular shops in its home\ncountry of America, Anthropologie,\nPPQ to design stylish swimcaps\nSchweppes and PPQ have set up the\n\u201cGet Britain Schwimming\u201d campaign.\nClothing line PPQ have designed a\ncollection of four swimming caps\nbased on four British traditions- Punk,\nFifties, Royal and Rockabilly. These\ndesigns are available only on eBay. All\nproceeds go to the swimming trust.\n\u201cFashion needs to\ncause controversy\nfrom time to time\u201d\nClockwise from top: Hilary Alexander clutching a Chanel goody bag in Paris;\nAnna Wintour, Desiree Rogers and Hilary Alexander at Thakoon in New York;\nHilary clutching her Doobydoll; Rihanna, Carine Roitfeld and Beyonce all\ndonning Balmain\namongst others, urging them to stop\nsending \u201cminiscule garments\u201d for their\nphotoshoots. Whilst sample sizes continue to linger around the 2-4 region,\ndesigners like Christopher Kane and\nLagerfeld have since created looks for\nBeth Ditto. Is there a contradiction\nsomewhere?\n\u201cI think fashion needs to cause controversy from time to time. It\u2019s about\ncreating something different to get\neverybody talking. \u2018Oh gosh, she\u2019s a\nsize 22\u2019. But if you go back through the\npaintings at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury, like the art nouveau movement \u2013 many paintings or sketches\nwere of women who were quite volup-tuous. It just hasn\u2019t been done recently.\nTo be honest, it\u2019s all about rising to the\nchallenge. I think it was very brave for\nKarl to dress Beth Ditto.\u201d\nTime was up for us. Hilary\u2019s assistant Olivia strolled past and cheerfully\nreminded us of the time. The \u2018Devil\nWears Prada\u2019 myth of the demanding\nboss and the poor assistant is not true\nhere. Hilary is not that kind of boss.\nShe is someone who genuinely loves\nfashion for all the right reasons and she\nis someone who rises above the surreal\nhype of fashion. For these reasons she\nnever loses her place in the fashion\nranks.\nI\nsaw a black mini dress in French\nElle \u2013 full central front zip,\nthin straps, clingy and low cut.\nFrench sexiness at the price of\n\u20ac9.99? Yes, please.\nLast night I wore it to a bar on the\nOld Brompton Road, adjacent to\nthe Chanel boutique. Oh boy. Calling it a fashion faux pas would be an\nunderstatement.\nThe reality was closer to a fashion ca-tastrophe. I am busty. Instead of wearing a pair of Converse to tone down\nthe look, like French Elle, I wore a pair\nof block-heel sandals. I was the Pretty\nWoman of the night...\nDon\u2019t believe everything the magazine says. The \u201cIt\u201d look is arbitrary until you try it on (simple solution: look\nin the mirror - twice!).\nAs you can see, there is not much\nin this issue \u2013 except for Hilary. I remember my first encounter with her.\nIt was the Giles Deacon show at the\nV&A earlier in the summer. I had a\nrucksack on my back, holding a camera\nand a stand, and on my forehead were\ndrops of sweat. I spotted Hilary chatting to a few people. I dashed over and\ndidn\u2019t hesitate to reach out my hand\nto shake hers. If you had seen me- an\neager, sweaty Bridget Jones running\ntowards you, you would have pushed\nyour friends towards me and run off to\ncall security.\nAnyway, Hilary shook my hand with\na smile. I told her \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan\u2026\u201d\nand she gave me her card. She told me\nthat she\u2019d been off sick for a week but\nasked me to phone her assistant none-theless. I\u2019ve framed Hilary\u2019s card on my\nfridge door. She is a legend!\nNext week we talk country style \u2013\nthe bigger and better trend that can\nno longer be ignored; Anshie Patel\ntakes us on a trip to the country where\nshe will tell you the prerequisites of\ncountry-style chic. Also there will be a\nshopping feature for people of all different shapes and sizes.\nThank you for reading about my pathetic life, until next time.\nthe big sister of the ever popular\nUrban Outfitters, will soon arrive on\nLondon\u2019s Regent Street.\n\n"

Yep, it\nis very often too extrovert for an engineering student like me, I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019ll ever live somewhere that is so much\nfun \u2013 the thing that seems to be exclusively what most of its residents live\nfor!\nI\nseem to have been the only\nperson in the whole of Imperial who does not feel the need\nto thrive off the euphoria of\nwearing an impressive billowing\nHarry-Potter-like-gown.\nI have bumped into some old friends\nand they actually had a vivid look of incredulity on their stunned faces when I\nsaid \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not going to graduation\nbut I\u2019m going to do some work instead!\u2019\nMy nerdish traits surprise even myself\nsometimes, I am doing a postgraduate\ncourse so I\u2019m not really in need of any\ngraduation ceremonies at present.\nWell, as you can imagine, most people thought I was mad for not wanting\nto attend my own graduation: \u2018why\nFor a start, bars-wise it\u2019s by far my\nfavourite place to go out at night. It\u2019s\nwealth of colourful individualistic\ndrinking and partying holes laugh\nin the faces of the pathetic corporate\nYoungs and Fullers dominated machines of Paddington and Hammersmith. They\u2019re crowded with students,\nmusicians, fashion designers and all\nother kinds of interesting people,\nmost of the time dancing rather\nthan sitting and always having\na laugh. Even better are the\nranges of booze: Kick-ass\nlagers like Kirin Ichiban\nand Birra Morreti are\ncommonplace, and you\ncan find some\nof the weirdest\nales. And a personal favourite,\nAspall Cyder\nis found pretty\ncheap in Catch\naren\u2019t you going?\u2019 was the general\nquestion. Well, the answer to that is\nbecause it\u2019s all a lie! Of course it\u2019s all\na lie! We spend 3-4 years toiling and\ncomplaining and shitting about absolutely everything! Then when it\u2019s all\nover, we\u2019re expected to celebrate the\npoor form of living we have endured\nfor so long. Sorry, but the harrowing\nexperiences of university life, coupled\nwith that of living at home and still being made to feel like a child, does not\nimprint many happy memories for me.\nThe second reason for my absence\nwas because when I bought the tickets\nto let the parents into this student haven we call University, they mentioned\nhow bored they were when they went\n(which super-Hoxton party girl Florence Welsh seems to enjoy). But this is\nnothing compared to the bar interiors\nthemselves, which range from ornate\n- the Commercial Tavern, for exam-ple, has cov- ered all two\nto my older sister\u2019s graduation, subsequently making me refund the tickets\nfeeling wholly un-proud, whilst booking their own tickets for a trip abroad.\nThirdly, I didn\u2019t get the class of degree that I was aiming for. I was close,\nbut it didn\u2019t happen. So acting like I\u2019m\nall happy for something that I feel I\nfailed at is not something I want to do.\nHence, I shall, once again, be the oddball and act anti-socially, by being the\nannoyingly depressive person out of\na crowd of happy smiling people with\nflashing cameras and proud parents.\nI must say, there was a mellow sadness about today. Perhaps it was because I felt alienated, and subjected to\nincredulous looks the whole day that\nfloors, in Roman cum Indian and\nMoorish mosaics and chandeliers \u2013 to\ngloriously run down, like the intriguing\npub The Griffin. The Red Lion is basically some weird-arse living room that\nsells Kronenbourg.\nThe music is fantastic as well. Whilst\nthere are legions of fancy pansy indie\nbands, there are also some pretty\nexciting real bands, like Ulterior.\nAnd Old Blue Last, owned by\nvice magazine, seems to take\nanything from metal to rap.\nBut a party there doesn\u2019t\njust mean impenetrable\nunderground music;\nthe classics will always come\nout. And I\ndon\u2019t mean\nBritney, I\nmean The\nFaces, the\nSmall Faces,\nmade my sadness kick in.\nOn an utterly random note, I made\na complete utter fool of myself on the\ntube yesterday. Having tried to act so-cial, rather than the other people who\nlooked like the essence of life had been\nknocked out of them, I stabbed at a\nconversation with a middle aged lady\nsitting next to me. She was looking\nover a publicising leaflet for some artist called Cecil Collins, and I unfortunately mixed that up in my trying-to-be-social brain with Cecil Helman. I\nspoke suddenly to the woman, saying\nhow I met the person described on the\nleaflet; she looked very interested, but\nsaid that I couldn\u2019t have met him, because he had been dead for 10 years.\nOh crap.\nThen I apologised profusely saying\nhow I had mixed the artist up with\nCecil Helman, who I was contemplating whether I had actually met before.\nI have just googled him now, and yuphe\u2019s dead too. To cover up my huge\nembarrassment, I enquired after the\nartist, and the lady got a bit passionate and started talking about the soul,\nsomething that terrified me a little, I\nhave no idea why. I was then incredibly\nunsocial and returned to my newspaper with a grace befitting incivility of\nthe highest rank.\nShe said goodbye when she left the\ntrain.\nT-Rex, Joy Division, Blur \u2013 not always\ndeep, but soulful.\nBut the gentrification of Shoreditch\nand Hoxton (ShoHo) is a new thing,\nand the new funky crowd has not obliterated the armies of settlers that have\nlived here for years. And this means\nawesome, great value curry houses\n(No, not the ones on Brick Lane).\nLike Chaat, where you\u2019ll get a genuine\nbut exceptional meal for under a ten-ner. And there are loads more like it\nin Whitechapel, but get in on the act\nquick while they\u2019re still true, because\nthe Rough Guides and Time Outs are\ncreeping up on them like leeches.\nThere\u2019s so much more to say about\nwhy I love the area; the fry ups in the\nmornings, the awesome sample sales in\nnew shops desperate to be cool, booze-ing in Victoria Park in the sun. But the\nbest advice I can give is to go there. Go\nthere twice, go with your best mates,\nmake a night of it. You won\u2019t regret it.\n7\nfelix FRIDAY 23 OCTOBER 2009\n\n"
