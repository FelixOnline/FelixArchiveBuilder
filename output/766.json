FELIX, Friday March 6th198710 Comedy Largo De sola to Comedy can be a strange thing and\nVaclav Havel's latest, adapted by\nTom Stoppard, a fellow Czeck, is\nsomewhat less than normal. The\nOrange Tree, Richmond, houses this\nproduction on a stage of about 10' by\n10' with the audience an arm's length\naway.\nThe centre of the show is Dr\nLeapold Kopria, played by Geoffrey\nBeevers, a philosopher who has been\naccused of 'intelligent hooliganism\u2014\narticle 5.11.1' and so is forced to wait\nfor the inevitable knock on the door.\nMistresses, friends and supporters\ndrop in, aiming to bolster his\nconfidence, but merely create an\ninsane atmosphere of repetition.\nThere is a strong feeling of 'them' and\n'us', although we never find out who\n'they' are or where 'there' actually\nis\u2014all very reminiscent of Kafka's The Trial\u2014and we quickly wonder\nwho it is that's actually mad.\nMr Beevers' performance is\ncertainly that of a character slightly\nunhinged, terrible nervousness, his\npre o cup ation with the doorbell and\nmanic pill popping. Time and time\nagain we hear lines repeated, by\ndifferent characters, and the second\nhalf is almost a mirror image of the\nfirst, although not quite. The\nincessant repetitions soon show Dr\nKopria's life for what it is, yet we\nwonder whether perhaps we are the\nroot of the insanity and maybe he's just an innocent victim of society's introspective view of philosophers.\nThe comic elements are masterly\nplayed, or perhaps the audience's laughter is pure relief\u2014anyway we\nlaugh, the mill workers proving that\ntiming makes comedy. As a whole\nshow it is entertaining although as a mill worker aptly states \"someone's got to be sensible,\" yes, but who?\nAidan Kershaw.\nMusic Pink PegS lax Today sees the welcome return of\nLeeds' band Pink Peg Slax to\nImperial. Since they were here last\nyear, when most people missed them,\nthey have had several Radio One\nsessions and recently an appearance\non The Tube. Their brand of Rock 'n' Roll with tongue firmly planted in the\ncheek is more fun than a maths\ntutorial, and provides more laughs\nthan a cruise on the Titanic. The party\nis being held jointly with Richmond\nCollege, and support is provided by\nCollege's lovable psycho billies Dave\nPuppy and the Happy Dogs. If you\nhave shied away from College gigs\nbecause you've never heard of the\nband, you owe it to yourself to break\nwith tradition. Doors open at 8.00pm and the whole shebang takes place in\nthe Union Lounge (tickets \u00a31.50). See\nyou there\u2014Yee Hah!\nBooks Evolution from Space The concept of 'spontaneous\ngeneration'\u2014the idea that organisms\noriginate from basic material such as\nearth and water\u2014persisted from\nAristotle (384 to 322 BC) right up\nuntil the mid 19th Century. This\nbelief persisted even in the face of\nexperiments such as the one\nconducted by the Italian physician\nFrancesco Redi in 1668 in which he\ndemonstrated that maggots would not\nform in meat if flies were kept away\nfrom it. It was Louis Pasteur who\nfinally delivered the coup de grace to\nthe spontaneous generation doctrine\nwith a series of cleverly designed and\ndecisive experiments.\nBut this does not explain the origin\nof life\u2014the actual instant when life\ncan be said to have 'occurred' or\n'come about'. The generally accepted\ntheory is that the formation of the\nmolecules essential to life\u2014the DNA\nmolecule, able to replicate itself,\nenzymes capable of cat aly sing reactions at a rate far faster than they\nnaturally proceed\u2014came about as a random event, occurring in what is\nrather loosely referred to as 'the\nprimordial soup'. This theory would\nseem to have been confirmed by\nvarious experiments, an account of\nwhich can be found in Carl Sagan's excellent book Cosmos.\nIn Evolutionfrom Space the authors\nFred Hoyle and Chandra\nWickramasinghe reject the idea that\nlife originated on Earth, and back up\ntheir alternative theory with some\nconvincing evidence.\nEnzymes are proteins with highly\ncomplex structures that can be split\ninto at least three levels. Hoyle and\nWickramasinghe invite the reader to\nconsider the probabilities involved in\nthe random evolution of even simple\nenzymes. The total probability for\nobtaining a working enzyme\u2014and a small one at that\u2014comes out as one\npart in IE+ 20. And when we face the\nfact that there are about two thousand\nknown enzymes, the probabilities\nbecome truly vast.\nThe authors also point to histones\nas evidence of the general\nimprobability of life. Histones are\nproteins which help to pack the DNA\ncomplement of an organism into the\nnucleus\u2014no mean feat when you\nconsider that the DNA of one human\nchromosome is 5 cms long. Histones\nare one of the most highly conserved\nproteins known\u2014over the whole of\nthe plant and animal kingdoms the\namino acid order of the histones of\nvaio us organisms is remarkably\ninvariant. The probability of\nrandomly deriving the simplest\nhistone is even smaller than for\nenzymes.\nIn short the authors argue that life\nis simply too improbable to have\noriginated on Earth.\nHoyle and Wickramasinghe don't stop here; they go on to point out\nmany other discrepancies in the\ngenerally accepted view of things.\nMany bacteria can withstand doses of\nX rays millions of times greater than\nthey would ever be exposed to in the\ncourse of normal life on Earth. (This\npoint becomes of great importance\nlater on). Many insects respond to\nwavelengths of light not found on the\nsurface of the Earth. Why were these\ncapabilities ever developed! If it was\nin response to conditions that existed\nmany millions of years ago, why are\nthose capabilities still in existance,\nwith no selection pressure to keep\nthem going? In addition, the fossil\nrecords of Earth, if examined, show\nthat evolution on Earth took place in\nrelatively large strides. This is exactly\nwhat Darwinian evolution does not\naccount for. There is no evidence for\na gradual change in the organisms of\nthe planet.\nHaving knocked out Darwin, Hoyle\nand Wickramasinghe present their\nown hypothesis; if life is too\nimprobable to have originated on the\nEarth, because the numbers are\nastronomical, then might not the\nsolution also be astronomical? Could\nthe DNA which started life on Earth\narrived from off the planet, in the\nform of virion (virus particle) or even\nin a dormant cell? Calculations\ncertainly show that such particles are\nthe right size to be accelerated by\nradiation from stars; many bacteria\nand viruses are indeed the ideal\nsize\u2014between one tenth of a micron\nand 3 microns. If this is the case then\nit would certainly explain the\nresistance of bacteria to mutation by\nX rays. Bacteria can also survive the\nextremely low temperatures of space,\nand the almost zero pressure.\nPropelled by light a virus particle\ncould attain speeds of the order of\nthousands of kilometres a second. At\ntypical re-entry velocities of 40 km\nper second there is a maximum\ndiameter of up to one micrometre\nwhich would not burn up. This\nmaximum diameter admits vi roid s, viruses and most bacteria.\nEvolutionfrom Space is not a book\nwhich can be dismissed lightly as the\nwork of cranks. Both the authors are\nhighly regarded scientists; Sir Fred\nHoyle has received worldwide\nacclaim for his contribution to\nastronomy, and Professor Chandra\nWickramasinghe is a leading\nauthority on interstellar matter. This\nreview really does the book injustice,\nsumma rising in a few paragraphs\nwhat really needs chapters to fully\nexplain. The ideas that abound in\nEvolution from Space are not wildly\nth own out, but carefully reasoned and\npresented with the appropriate\nevidence. The conclusions drawn are\nunwelcome\u2014they go against the grain\nof what we have been taught in school\nand by textbooks.\nEvolution from Space is a fascinating read. And before you\ndismiss it, remember that the true\nessence of 'scientific method' is\nmoving in the direction in which the\nevidence and Nature points, no matter\nhow unwelcome from a human point\nof view that direction may seem.\nEvolutionfrom Space, by Sir Fred\nHoyle and Professor Chandra\nWickramasinghe is a Palladin Book,\npublished by Granada in paperback,\ncosting \u00a31.95.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday March 6th19872 Abortion\nDear Dave,\nAbortion\u2014one of the apparent few.\nwho thinks that a woman has the right\nto choose what is to happen to her\nbody, on contraception failure.\nI 've been amazed recently by\nopinions voiced in discussions of the\n'Miss S and Mr C court case. Not\nonly do we have to absorb the\nnegative female imagery in everything\nfrom hard porn to the subtle (and\nmore disturbing, as many people are\ndisgust'ed by snuff movies)\nadvertising...but can witness an ex-boyfriend daring to force a woman to\ncarry a child for 9 months plus a \"health endangering birth\" (her GP).\nThis woman is being treated as a baby machine (the violation of which,\nincident ly. is worth less than that of\n\"property, according to the male\njudiciary). And what is sex for,\nexcept for conception?\u2014I don't believe that she wanted to conceive\n(who. in her position would want to\nwreck good prospects by becoming a single parent?)\nI refuse to accept that a woman\nshould have to pay such a great\npenalty for a situation created by both\nher and this man, (I do question her\ntaste). If she has an illegal, or self\ninflicted, abortion due to a successful\nappeal I hope that she recovers\nquickly with all the support from\nfriends she needs a deserves.\nYours,\nClare Murphy, Civ. Eng. III.\nLast straw\nDear Felix,\nI have only been here two terms but\nI think that is quite long enough to be\ncompletely disillusioned by the utterly\nuseless and pathetic student Union we\nhave. Last week's FELIX was the last\nstraw.\nI have always found anything\nChristine Taig has said amazing but\nher comments concerning the recent\nNUS demonstration were ridiculous.\nHow can she accuse the NUS of being\nnaive when her only solution to the\ngrants and loans problem is to vote\nLabour in the forthcoming election.\nSometimes I feel she is completely out\nof touch with reality.\nIn the same article was a report on\nthe ULU march protesting against the\nproposed 50% cuts. How many IC\nstudents knew about this march? How\nmany IC students knew about the\n50% cuts and how this affects them?\nThey certainly weren't told about it\nby our own Union yet this should be\nan important issue for many IC\nstudents. I, myself, live near the ULU\nfacilities which are certainly\nconsiderably better than anything IC\ncan provide, and since our Union\nseems unable to organise suitable\nentertainment for its own members,\nit will be a sad loss if the proposed\ncuts are implemented.\nAnother subject is the proposed (or\nhas it been passed?) government\nlegislation preventing students from\nclaiming housing benefit. Now I'm the typically badly informed student\nwho knows nothing about this.\nShouldn't there have been some\nopposition to this? Or at least I feel\nwe should be a little more informed\non what is a very relevant concern for\nall students.\nBack to FELIX. I nearly died when\nI read the end of the President's piece.\nShe actually says when referring to\nCollege administration, \"this lack of\ninformation and communication is\ndoing a great deal to damage any\nsense of community that the College\nhas. Life would be a lot easier and\nmore relaxed for everyone at College\nif those in po session of information\ndidn't wait for aggrieved students and\nstaff to come knocking on their doors\nbefore being prepared to distribute\nit.\" I suggest she takes a close look\nat her own Union.\nUntil the ICU stops promoting their\nown political beliefs and their\noversized egos and start getting\ninterested in the welfare of their\nmembers by promoting relevant\nissues I will continue to be\ndisillusioned and \"apathetic.\"\nYours sincerely,\nCW Gray, Mech. Eng. IP Bayada, Mech. Eng. I Bible bashing\nDear Sir,\nI read with dismay the two letters\nin last week's FELIX responding to\nmy letter of the previous week. Both\nof them precisely illustrate the point\nabout not having time to listen to\nanyone else. The authors may have\nread the letter, but they so completely\nfailed to hear what I was saying.\nMaybe if Andrew and Matthew and\nothers as well, were to quietly re-read\nthe letter with open hearts, they might\nhear something very different. They\nmight hear of a God who is not out\nto threaten them, or criticise or\ncondemn them, or to tie them down\nwith a set of rules, but one whose\nheart is filled with compassion,\nopen ess and love.\nOn the criticism made of the\nquotation and New Society, maybe it\nwould have helped if Andrew had\nread the article first. He would\nprobably have found that it actually\ncoincided with his own attitudes\ntowards down-and-outs. As for me,\nI have friends who are or have been\nprostitutes, heroin addicts, alcoholics,\nor tramps and I love them dearly. I know some of their life histories and\nit breaks me just to hear of them. I'm sorry Andrew misinterpreted my\nattitude.\nOpen, searching hearts are the only\nones that will ever find God.\nYours,\nRob Brown, Civ. Eng. PG.\nPromises, Promises\nThough the Executive might wish to\ndeny it, IC union, like the rest of\nImperial College, is a slave to\nbureaucracy. As the \"administration\"\ncontinually expands, there is little\nopportunity for new initiatives to get\noff the ground. Though we are\nsupposedly seeing a move towards\n\"forward planning\" this year, the\nprogress so far has been for a subcommittee (the Union Planning\nGroup) to set up three sub-committees\n(working parties) which may\neventually report back to a major\ncommittee (Council). To date, one\nworking party has decided something,\none has decided nothing and the third\nmay have decided something.\nGeneral meetings are frankly\nuseless as a means of communication\nwith the student body as a whole. It\nis asking too much of anyone who\ndoes not have exceptional patience to\nsit through hours of petty procedural\nsquabbling. This is not going to\nchange until somebody takes it upon\nthemselves to re-write those pages of\nprinted drivel known as standing\norders.\nThis is why the sabbatical elections\nare so important. The officers you\nelect next week will, as far as the\nSherfield sharks are concerned be\nnext year's IC Students' Union. The\nelections are one of the few\nopportunities all students have to\naffect the running of ICU. It is\nimperative that the right candidates\nare elected\u2014College administration\nhave no qualms about treading all\nover weak Union officers if it suits\nthem to do so.\nThere is no harm in being severely\ncynical when weighing up the election\npromises the candidates make. The\nimportant question is, \"why are you\nstanding for this post?\" Nobody who\nstands for a sabbatical does so because\nthey \"feel they are the best\nman/woman for the job.\" This is sort\nof altruism is confined to saints and\ndeities\u2014and there are none of either\nat IC. Every prospective sabbatical is\ninterested in whether the year will\nbenefit them. I mean no disrespect to\npeople whose concern for ICU is\nentirely genuine, and I am not\nimplying that candidates are after\nextra Brownie points for their CVs.\nThe reality is that sabbatical\ncandidates stand because they feel it\nis a positive way for them to spend\na year; it is their reasons for thinking\nthis that give the best indication as to\nwho will do the best job.\nFelix and things\nAs usual, as the end of term is\napproaching, there will be no FELIX\nnext Friday; instead there will be a final issue on Wednesday March\n18th.

Chas has shown that\nhe is prepared to do this. As Union Publicity\nOfficer, Chas has produced tons of posters, being\none of the people who ensured that the QT boycott\nwas a success. He has served on working parties\nto reorganise the Union and has helped in the office\ndoing the jobs that nobody else has time to do.\nChas, though, has not just become involved this\nyear in order to become a sabbatical. He has been\ninterested in the Union for longer than he and I care\nto remember. Vote for Chas Jackson for a hard\nworking Hon Sec.\nHugh Southey\nNext year there are a number of important changes\nwhich must be made to the Union Office and\norganisation. The Hon Sec and all the sabbaticals\nmust be closely involved with this. An Hon Sec\nmust also be a decision maker with proposals for\nthe good of the Union. Amongst my concrete\nproposals are:\nDuplicating\nAs the Union Office now has two geste tn ers and\ntwo electrostatic scanners, I will try to set up ages tet ner with a scanner for the use of clubs and\nsocieties.\nExec News\nIt is vitally important that students are kept\ninformed of the actions of Union Officers and\nsabbaticals. If elected I would produce this\nfortnightly and print it in FELIX. I hope that it will\ninclude adverts for discounts in local cinemas and\nshops.\nTransport\nExpansion of the fleet would mean that more non-RCC clubs could use the vans at weekends.\nHowever I will examine possible alternatives to\nbuying new vans. Perhaps contract hiring could\nprovide an answer. At the moment, outside hire\nof vans at weekends is very expensive.\nChas Jackson\nFELIX EDITOR Chris Edwards, proposed by Adrian Johnson\nOver the time that he has been involved with\nFELIX, Chris has become one of the most regular\ncontributors to FELIX and other publications in\nCollege. He has taken on, at various times, the\nmantles of News Editor, Features Editor, Designer,\nCartoonist and Columnist on FELIX, introducing\nnew ideas in layout and in writing. This makes him\nthe most experienced candidate for Editor, with\nenough knowledge of where to make major\nchanges.\nChris was brought in to edit Phoenix last year\nin order to revamp its image, a task which he did\nin style to produce a truly seductive magazine. It\nwas described in FELIX at the end of last term as\n\"the best produced Phoenix ever\".\nAll in all this makes Chris the best all-round\ncandidate for FELIX Editor.\nAdrian Johnson\nFor years now, FELIX has been stifled by lack of\nimagination and planning to end up with a paper\nthat won't last for a Friday lecture let alone the\nwhole morning. Successive editors have plodded\nout a safe course trying to avoid new ideas and\ncontroversy. However, now you have a chance to\nmake Friday mornings worth reading once more.\nI have stood for FELIX Editor in order to breathe\nnew life into the paper. This will involve\nrestructuring the paper, making it more flexible to\nsudden developments. News and features will be\nexpanded with controversial topics and extra\nbackground to flesh them into real articles.\nHumour, so often relegated, will be given special\nprominence with regular cartoons and sharp satire.\nIt would be easy to produce just another FELIX,\nand many could do it\u2014but to pick it off the floor\nand deliver real entertainment on a Friday means\njust one candidate.\nFor FELIX Editor, vote Chris Edwards.\nChris Edwards\nFELIX EDITOR Judith Hackney, proposed by Ciaran Hassett\nJudith Hackney is one of the best candidates ever\nto have stood for the post of FELIX Editor. She\nhas made a substantial contribution to FELIX under\nthree different editors, and is best known for editing\nthe excellent ICU Handbook. As a senior staff\nmember she has a thorough knowledge of all\nproduction techniques, including writing,\ntypesetting, laying out and printing. She has held\nseveral important Union posts, including two years\nas Publications Board Junior Treasurer and Vice\nPresident of RCSU. But of much more importance\nshe is reliable, hardworking and enthusiastic. She\nis also a strong believer in teamwork and always\nencourages other people's input into a project. All\nthese qualities combine to make for the best possible\nFELIX so put a'1' against JUDITH HACKNEY's name on Monday or Tuesday.\nCiaran Hassett\nFELIX is produced to provide information,\nentertainment and criticism. It must cater for as\nwide a range of students as possible. It is not enough\nto be proficient at producing a newspaper. The\nEditor must be able to generate a tight and well-formatted publication with quality news and sports\ncoverage; encourage articles from both regular and\noccasional contributors; inspire and advise the staff;\nrun the Print Unit efficiently and competently.\nAs Editor, I intend to restructure FELIX with\ndefinite sections for news, features and sports. Each\nsection will have its own style; a well-ordered, easy\nto read news section with background and analysis\nof events plus external news of interest to students;\na magazine-type features section including\npreviews/reviews, cinema and theatre listings,\nmusic and fashion; a more comprehensive sports\nsection that reports on and previews matches with\na weekly, up-to-date results table.\nIf you want to see my kind of FELIX next year,\nvote HACKNEY 1.\nJudith Hackney\n\n"

After several\nweeks build-up and campaigning it\nwas really depressing that only 20%\nor so of the electorate bothered to\nvote. When there are so few-candidates standing it's quite difficult\nto drum up enthusiasm, but none the\nless If a el compelled to try! So. please\nvote on Monday and Tuesday in your\ndepartment...a Union sabbatical gets\nfree accommodation and \u00a33.500 a year on your behalf; and is expected\nto speak for you on all sorts of issues.\nIf you don't vote, don't be surprised\nif your representatives end up talking\nrubbish on your behalf. If you're not\nimpressed with either candidate in an\nelection, you can register an\nabstention. This is not the same as not\nvoting\u2014you write 'ABSTAIN' on the\npaper: and if abstentions outnumber\nvotes the election has to be re-run.\nMore Elections\nICU and its constituents aren't the\nonly ones holding elections at present.\nThe race is also on for the ULU posts\nof President, Vice-president (services)\nand Vice-president (finance and\nadmins t ration).

If\nanyone wants to find out more about\nRobert Daniel\nI treasure the knowledge of my,\nsexuality more than anything else in\nmy life (that's not to say that love and\nfriendship don't come a very close\nsecond!) People I have met tend to\nassume that they know everything\nthere is to know about homosexuals\nsimply because they understand that\nwe are attracted to members of our\nown sex.\nWhat saddens me is that many\npeople think that all there is to\nheterosexuality is sleeping with a member of the opposite sex. I feel that\nheterosexuals have lost out in not\nhaving had to explore their feelings\nfully, as I have done.\nBecause lesbians and gay men are\nborn to heterosexual parents and in\na het-dominated society they do not\nrealise, their true feelings until the\nonset of puberty and adolescent\nyearnings for sexual experience.\nAt this age of about 14\u201419\nheterosexuals and homosexuals split;\nwhile heterosexuals continue along\nthe path already laid down for them,\nhomosexuals must try and decide\nwhat they really feel inside. It was at\nthe candidates in these election, or to\ntalk to the nice GUC delegates about\nwhich way their votes should go.\ncome to the Union Lounge today at\n12.30pm. All the candidates have\nbeen invited to a hustings meeting\u2014\nthe usual format of short speeches and\nquestions will be followed. Everyone\nwelcome\u2014GUC delegates please\ncome along.\nAIDS Campaign\nThere's a meeting of ICU and\ncampus trades unions along with\nCollege personnel and welfare staff,\nnext Tuesday lunchtime, to discuss a co-ordinated. College-wide AIDS\ninformation campaign. As AIDS is\nsomething which affects us all, staff\nand students, I hope we can organise\none campaign, effectively and\nsensibly. If anyone's got brilliant\nideas for posters, leaflets or any other\ncampaign materials, come and see\nme, before Tuesday if possible.\nAnd Finally\nI can't be the only one who's longing to get away from Imperial\nCollege for a while. If you're feeling\nthat way too, don't forget British\nRail's big discounts on 'Saver' fares\nthis month for rail card holders.\nTempting thought?

This sounds very narcissistic,\nand it is\u2014but that's part of my\nsexuality. Everyone has their own\nunique sexuality; no two people are\nattracted by exactly the same things.\nI spent a year or so agonising about\nwhether or not I was 'queer'\u2014no one\ntold me then that being gay is OK.\nAnother plus about being\nhomosexual\u2014not that I'm recruiting\nbecause either you are or you're\nnot\u2014is that because we have to\ndiscover most things for ourselves we\nare not bound by the false morality\nthat blinds many heterosexuals.

    "content": "Opinion FELIX, Friday March 6th1987 Collective Defence by David Burns Last week at Imperial, Tony Benn MP\nadvocated a British withdraw! from\nthe North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganisation, and political association\nwith the non-all ign ed states. Such\narguments have gained momentum\nrecently, moving hand-in-hand with\nthe continuing prominence of the\nCampaign for Nuclear Disarmament.\nHowever, if such a move was self-evident we would not have remained\na member of NATO for the last thirty-eight years. As this is an issue which\naffects us all, it is worth asking why\nis there a NATO, why are we part of\nit, and what would be the price of our\nwith drawl? The North Atlantic Treaty was\nsigned on 4th April 1949, initially\nwith twelve member states\u2014now\nincreased to sixteen. It provides for\ncollective defence against a perceived\npost war threat from Soviet expansion\nin Europe.\nDuring the years immediately\nfollowing the Second World War, the\nUnited States pumped cash aid into\nWestern Europe, while the Soviet\nUnion gradually established\ncommunist systems in the nations\nwhich had come under its control.\nMarshall Aid from the US was\ndeclined by these countries. As a consequence, they never realised their\neconomic potential in the way that\nWestern Europe had done.\nMeanwhile, in the West, the\neconomic rev it all is ation continued at\na pace, reinforced by the security\noffered by NATO. When the Federal\nRepublic of Germany was admitted to\nNATO, in May 1955, it took the\nSoviet Union nine days to implement\nits own plans for collective military\noperations, by producing the Warsaw\nPact, a mirror of NATO. Whether the\nformation of the Warsaw Pact was\nprompted by a fear of increased\nWestern military potential on the\nfrontier of its sphere of influence, or\nby the need to enhance its own\noffensive capabilities, is unclear.\nWhatever the motive, the European\ndivide, the \"Iron Curtain\" as\nChurchill described it, was firmly in\nplace across the continent.\nThe segregation of Europe, and the\nprolonged Cold War which followed,\nhave led to difficulties in gu aging the\nprecise nature of the present Soviet\n\"threat\". There may once have been\na real intent on the part of the Soviet\nUnion to increase its sphere of\ninfluence in the European theatre,\npossibly involving the unification of\nGermany. The establishment of\nNATO has undoubtedly dispelled\nsuch ideas, for the present. Such is\nthe nature of deterrence. The threat\nfrom the Warsaw Pact is still there,\nbut its own severe internal problems,\nand the very presence of NATO,\nmake the prospect of the Red Army\nrolling across the plains of West\nGermany a very unlikely one.\nThe Soviet capacity for massive\nconventional and nuclear assault upon\nthe West is still a real threat. Of\ncourse, the large conventional and\nnuclear counter which NATO\ndeploys, can be regarded as a threat\nto the Soviet Union, and so the\nendless \"Catch 22\" arguments, as to\nprecisely who is a threat to who,\nGermany, Britain's contribution is\nkey. It is a responsibility that we\ncannot afford to shirk.\nIn the, at present unlikely, event of\na full scale Warsaw Pact attack on\nWestern Europe, NATO's major\nproblem is that its largest available\nforce is rooted on the other side of the\nAtlantic. In such a situation the US\nreinforcement of current defences\nwould undeniably take time, and it is\nBritain's contribution to NATO,\nalong with the other \"front line\nstates\", which would buy this time.\nThe British Army on the Rhine\n(BAOR) is stationed in Germany to\navoid the necessity of bringing it\ncontinue. The real clue as to the intent\nof the opposing factions is in the way\nin which they train for the situations\nthey are likely to encounter. Whereas\nNATO forces constantly train to repel\nlarge scale Soviet tank incursions, and\nprojected invasions on the Northern\nfront (Norway and the Baltic), the\nSoviets train for amphibious assaults,\nairborne assaults, and massive\nmovements of armour. The message\nfrom this is clear. No matter how\nmuch the Soviet Union may claim that\nthey retain their forces for defensive\npurposes, they are trained in a highly\noffensive role. As such, the Soviet\nUnion must continue to be considered\nas a threat to the NATO nations.\nBritain's role in the defence of\nEurope, through NATO, is a crucial\none. Each military force in NATO has\na particular task assigned to it. With\nthe third largest navy in the world,\nand a substantial military presence in\nforward from Britain in the event of\nattack. Such delay could conceivably\nlead to the Warsaw Pact overrun n ning Western Europe before even half our\ndefences had been brought into place.\nThe Royal Navy's task is equally\nimportant. The logistical impossibility\nof transporting troops to the front in\nsufficient numbers by air, means that\nthere must be sufficient maritime\nstrength to carry US reinforcements\nby sea. The Royal Navy provides\n70% of NATO's maritime capability\nin the Eastern Atlantic, its chief job\nbeing anti-submarine operations. The\nSoviet submarine building\nprogramme of recent years has\nmushroomed, and as an almost\nentirely landlocked nation, its naval\ngrowth can in no way be justified as\ndefensive. Nor can its continued\nmaintenance of the largest land based\nmaritime air force in the world.\nThe trend towards a \"blue water\"\nschool of strategy in the Soviet Union\nis a worrying one. Increased Soviet\nnaval activity world wide can only be\nread as an indication of a more\naggressive military stance. This may\nbe due to a change in Soviet military\nthinking following events in the\nSecond World War, of which so\nmuch is made. They may now\nconsider offence to be the best\ndefence, and could respond to any\nperceived western \"threat\" in a more\naggressive manner.\nSo, with the above in mind, what\nwould be the price of a British\nwith drawl from NATO, and is such\na move fe as able? Financially, the\nsavings made in defence expenditure\nfrom a British with drawl from NATO\nwould be enormous. It is very easy\nsimply to slash the BAOR and the\nmajority of our navy, scrap Polaris\nand cut back the Royal Air Force.\nSuch a move could hardly be\nconsidered as wise. It would leave our\nNATO allies in the lurch, de stab a lise Europe, alienate the US, and isolate\nus from the rest of Europe. We may\nmake friends in the Third World, but\nthis cannot be considered as a desirable trade-off for throwing the\nwhole of Europe into turmoil.\nWith the current concern about the\nstab il ty of the US, and their dominant\npolitical and military role within\nNATO and the Western alliance as a whole, it might be better to consider\na more unified European approach to\ndefence and the political scene. This\nmight well act as a restraint, and a greater guiding influence on US\npolicy, as well as demonstrating more\nclearly to the European public that we\nare indeed part of an \"alliance\".\nOpting out of the European political\nscene by becoming a non-all ign ed state is just pie-in-the-sky fantasy,\ntotally out of British political\ncharacter.\nNATO is a defensive necessity, and\nas such should be retained intact.\nWhether or not its heavy reliance on\nnuclear deterrence is wise, is a matter\nfor further debate. In order to counter\nthe large Soviet conventional threat,\nwhich although different in nature\nfrom our own forces, is still massive\nenough to be considered as ultimately\noverwhelming, we presently have to\nrely on nuclear deterrence. It might\nbe possible to increase our\nconventional forces to the point where\nthey could halt a Soviet attack, but\nwith no nuclear deterrent behind\nthem, they would be open to\ndestruction by the Soviets' nuclear\narsenal. It is a reality we have to face\nin a nuclear world. There is no head-in-the-sand, non-all ign ed, soft option.\nThe case for NATO "

Imperial\nCollege only entered three eights\u2014\nthey are not greedy.\nThe Head is an annual race for\neights from constituent colleges of\nLondon University. This is rowing's equivalent of the Gutteridge Cup. The\nother colleges must have felt rather\noverwhelmed by IC. Our first eight\nfinished almost two minutes faster\nthan University College, the fourth\nfastest crew. Rowing at Imperial is in\na different league. This is not to\ndiminish the achievement; it was quite\nremarkable by any standards.\nOver the past few years the boat\nclub has grown in size and gathered\nprestige. There is no doubt that IC\nranks as the top college in London for\nrowing; the question is now how\nImperial compares with other\nuniversities. IC can be counted among\nthe country's top six rowing\nuniversities, with Oxford,\nCambridge, London, Durham and\nReading.\nIt is interesting to speculate on\nwhich of these is the best. The\nquestion is not merely of academic\ninterest. Channel Four is thought to\nbe evaluating the possibility of an\n\"Alternative Boat-Race.\" This race\nwould be between the fastest\nuniversity and the fastest club crew\nin the country. The race is still very\nmuch on the drawing board, but is\nalready making big ripples in the\nrowing world.\nThere is as yet no competition to\nestablish which is the fastest\nuniversity crew. The OxfordCambridge boat race takes place on\n28th March (12.55pm). For the first\ntime in history the main spring event\nfor eights\u2014the \"Tideway Head\"\u2014\nwill take place on the same day\n(3.45pm). Over four hundred crews,\nseveral from abroad, will compete on\nthe same stretch of water as the\nBoatrace. Imperial will be racing\nalong with the best clubs and\nuniversities, other than Oxford and\nCambridge. IC should perform well.\nIt would be a remarkable result if\nImperial College could beat some of\nthe big names, indeed it is premature\nto suggest that Imperial could pull off\nany major upset. But IC's gathering\nstrength will be a force to be reckoned\nwith in years to come, as our growing\nreputation attracts some of the best\njunior oarsmen.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, Friday March 6th19874 Letters\nWho are we\nto judge?\nDear Dave,\nWhenever a discussion on the\nproblems of South Africa arises it\nresults in a stream of correspondence.\nI regret that I am continuing this trend\nbut some of the points raised in the\nlast weeks warrant a reply.\nThe focus of these letters has been\nthe so-called terrorist activities of the\nANC and they seem to imply that it\nis per se a terrorist organisation. For\nyears, the ANC was an actively nonviolent organisation whose peaceful\nprotests were met with violence, and\n\u2022only after this did the ANC resort to\nviolence as a means of protest.\nHowever, by no means are all of its\nmembers terrorists, deserving to be\nannihilated 'as efficiently as possible'\nsimply for being a member of the\nANC\u2014as Mike Allen implied in his\nletters. These too are innocent people\nwho deserve protection or would you\nsay that all members of the ANC are\nterrorists? These people who are not\nallowed freedom of speech in their\nown country and have to seek refuge\nin other countries are to be killed as\nefficiently as possible. How can Mr\nAllen sit on his butt in this country\nand judge the actions of these\noppressed people? They have next to\nno rights in their own country and\nhave fought patiently for the peaceful\nreform which the white government\nis now offering, as a gift, with\nnumerous conditions attached. What\nmoral right has a South African\ngovernment, which has committed\nsuch atrocities as the killings of\npeaceful demonstrators in Soweto in\n1976, to insist that they will have no\ndiscussions with the ANC until it\nrenounces violence? Also, what moral\nCrossnumber\nMobius has presented me with\nanother of his tricky cross number puzzles. Each square contains one\ndigit, none of which are zero. As\nusual, there's a \u00a35 prize for a randomly selected correct solution\nhanded in before 1.00pm Wednesday\nat the FELIX office. I normally try\nand do a full page puzzle special at\nthe end of term, so if any of you know\nany good problems that I could use\nthen please send them in, thanks.\nCrossnumber clues\nAcross\n1. A multiple of 11 across.\n4. A prime number.\n5. Odd.\nright does this government have to\nfollow refugees into another country\nand kill them, when it arbitrarily\nenforces a state of emergency in their\nown country and orders a news\nblackout. Why must they have a news\nblackout? WHAT ARE THEY\nHIDING? Are they simply ushering\nblack protestors back into their homes\nor are they killing people who are\nrelatively unarmed and unprotected?\nThe British government can sit here\nand condemn Botha's act it iv i ties until\nthey are blue in the face but what are\nthey doing to stop him or cause him\nany substantial discomfort? They say\nsanctions will reduce funds and slow\ndown the pace of reform but is it a poor government that invades\nsurrounding countries to eliminate\nrelatively few people?\nSome people use the argument that\nunder white management South\nAfrica is the richest country in Africa.\nWhat other country has such cheap\nlabour that it can exploit with such\nlittle regard for their safety and\nfundamental human rights? In my\nopinion, the making of money by\nthese means is totally amoral\u2014the\nBlacks work and live in appalling\nconditions and the Whites enjoy the\nprofit. I agree that many African\ncountries are unstable but it is a difficult process uniting people with\nmany religious and tribal\ndifferences\u2014a problem evident in the\nconflict in Ireland. The good news is\nthat most of these countries are\nworking towards a better future for\nall their peoples. In the system of\napartheid the non-white races in South\nAfrica don't have this chance.\nThere is one point on which I will\nagree with Mike Allen. I found the\nbehaviour of the protestors outside Mr\nGoosen's talk offensive and counter\nproductive. Offensive in the reverse\nracism practised by the loud labelling\nof some of the white people who\nentered the room as racists. Counter\nproductive because they were\nprobably very well informed about\nthe facts and figures on South Africa\nand could have asked very pointed\nI2345678 \u2022\n9 IO\n\u2022 \u2022\n6. Digits all different; their sum is\n10.\n9. Digits all different.\n11. A prime number. The sum of\nquestions that would have made Mr\nGoosen very uncomfortable indeed.\nOf course, one of the most\ninformed people about the reforms in\nSouth Africa will be Dennis Worrall,\nthe former South African Ambassador\nto the UK who resigned his position\nto contest the forthcoming elections\non a platform campaigning for faster\nimplementation of these reforms. I sincerely hope that these peaceful\nreforms are the way forward for\nSouth Africa but the actions of the\npresent South African government do\nnot suggest that it will give the blacks\nand coloured s in South Africa real\nrights which will reflect the fact that\nthey are a majority and make the\nSouth African economy what it is\ntoday.\nYours sincerely.\nKemi Adenubi. Civ. Eng. II.\nIt's a depressing\nworld\nDear Dave,\nUntil I read FELIX last week I had\nthought it would be forever dominated\nby mindless bores regurgitating\npointless pro pog and a for outdated\npolitical clich es. However, having\nread the excellent article by notorious\nbe rk Francis Miers I am confident that\nsound philosophical thinking is\nreturning. I say drop the bomb,\noblivion now!\nMark Cottle.\nA lower life\nform writes a letter\nDear Dave,\n(Sounds like the Razzle letters\npage, this). I wish to complain in the\nstrongest possible terms about the\nslander which is being perpetrated\nabout me in the pages of FELIX. OK,\nso I admit that most of it is true, but\nI must register most vehemently my\ndisgust at being branded a hillman\nimp owner; I wouldn't be seen dead\nin such a prick mobile! I must now live\nwith this embarrassment for the rest\nof my life. Since the article in\nquestion appeared, I have been\nharangued by drunks making far ty imp noises at me, and I have been\nreduced to a figure of ridicule.\nYours faithfully,\nJ Ninety.\nIf the 'group of postgraduate civil\nengineering students' contact the FELIX\nOffice (internal 3515), I will publish their\nletter. Names can be withheld by request,\nbut I cannot include anonymous material.\nDavid Jones the digits is more than 5 and less than\n11.\nDown\n1. Odd. Each digit is greater than\nthe preceding one.\n2. Sum of digits is greater than 11.\n3. The same two digits as in 4\nacross.\n5. A perfect cube.\n7. Even. Sum of digits is 19.\n8. A perfect square.\n10. A perfect cube.\nRatty Problems\nThis problem was more accessible to\nanalysis than the previous, similar, rat\nproblem, as most of you who entered\nprobably realised. The \u00a35 prize winner was A J Perkins, Chem Eng 4, who\nexplained it quite well. The minimum\nsolution is 16 turns which can be seen\nas follows. Other than the finishing\nand starting squares there are 12 edge\nsquares to be visited and the path must\nmake a turn in each. Paths connecting\nthe edge squares that make no other\nturns form three rectangles, and\nmoving from one to the other of these\nrectangles takes two more moves.\nFinally, to complete the path, you\nhave to turn off, and back onto, the\ncenter diagonal. This makes sixteen\nturns in all. Within this basic pattern\nthere are several actual paths that can\nbe followed, one is shown below.\nWell done if you got it right.\n\n"

    "content": "Ill The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nKings students in mindless raid on IC Union office\nFilth! Outrage! Students from King's College plastered the Union Office with\neggs and flour and threw human excrement when they 'raided'\nthe IC Union Building on Wednesday afternoon. Several\nhundred pounds worth of damage was done to the office and\nto people's clothing. Two IC students were abducted and taken\nto King's College for part of the afternoon. They were later\nreturned to IC by car.\nPrior to the raid, two King's students had called at the Union\noffice, pretending to be\nrepresentatives of UL U entertainments committee. They said\nthat they wished to 'go for a drink'\nwith Union President Christine Taig\nto discuss a joint Rag meeting.\nBecause Ms Taig was occupied. Rag\nVice Chairman Judith Hackney and\nFELIX photographer Dave Burns\nagreed to go. Shortly after they left,\n6 King's students charged into the\nUnion office and threw flour and eggs\nin discriminant ly. There was no\nattempt to find or remove any ICU\nmascot. Union Receptionist Kathy\nTait was covered in eggs and flour in\nthe incident. One student threw a plastic bag containing human faeces\n(his own) across the room; this\nnarrowly missed Ms Taig and struck\none of the office windows.\nThe intruders then withdrew\nswiftly, but UGM Chairman Hugh\nSouthey and ICU Hon Sec Dave\nColley gave chase and managed to\napprehend one of them. He admitted\nto being from King's after Mr Colley\n(weighing 18 stone) hit him several\ntimes.\nThe Union office was then cleared\nfor the rest of the afternoon as the raid\nhad left it in an unusable condition.\nMs Taig rang King's College\nimmediately. Though she could not\ncontact any King's Union officer at\nonce, the call was returned by Rag\nOfficer Al Steger-Lewis (Mr StegerLewis is also Communications\nSecretary-elect, the equivalent of\nUnion President). He denied any\nforeknowledge of the raid, other than\nthe plan to abduct an IC student, and\nsaid that he did not know any of the\nstudents involved in the raid. Ms Taig\ndemanded that Ms Hackney and Mr\nBurns be returned immediately, and\nthat no demand for a ransom be made.\nShe also said that all cleaning bills\nwould have to be met by King's Union, unless the offenders returned\nto clear up themselves. Mr StegerLewis rang again shortly afterwards\nand said that he had \"identified some\nof the students.\" (Mr Burns and Ms\nHackney were in the room with Mr\nSteger-Lewis at the time, and later\ntold FELIX that the raiders were\npresent, and reported to have advised\nMr Steger-Lewis to pretend he knew\nnothing). Ms Taig said that she\nwanted letters of apology from each\nof the students. Mr Steger-Lewis said\nthat the raiders would not be willing\nto return to clear up the Union office\nbecause they said they feared\nreprisals.\nMr Colley and External Affairs\nOfficers Adrian Johnson (22 stone)\nwent to King's( Strand site) to pay a serious call. By the time they arrived,\nMr Burns and Ms Hackney were\nalready being returned to IC, having\nalready escaped once, only to be\nrecaptured, however, Mr Burns had\nspent one hour in handcuffs and Ms\nHackney had had an egg broken into\nher hair.\nA firm of contract cleaners were\nbrought in to clean out the Union\nOffice on Wednesday evening, and\nthe Office was re-opened on Thursday\nmorning. All bills for cleaning and for\nrepairs to the office are being\nforwarded to King's. They will also\nbe charged for an afternoon's wages\nfor the ICU permanent staff, who\nwere unable to use the office after the\nattack.\nKing's College Communications\nSecretary Frances Taylor rang\nyesterday and apologised profusely\nfor the incident, adding that she would\nfully support any action taken by\nICU. Ms Taig has also written a letter\nof complaint to the Principal of King's College, Professor Sutherland.\nMs Taylor told FELIX that King's would definitely be disciplining the\nstudents involved; she added that\nmatters of this nature were normally\nleft to the Union, though she added\nthat Professor Sutherland may choose\nto take action directly.\nSabbatical Election\nManifestos Inside\nFree Friday March6 th No. 766\n\n"

In the recent spate of sequels,\nAliens stands alone as the only\nentertaining and different one I can\nthink of. Calling it a sequel to the\nhighly successful Alien is possibly\nunfair, as it is more of an extension\nof the story on a totally different line.\nSigourney Weaver, who was a major part of what made Alien such\na classic, is the only surviving\ncharacter from the original. Again\nWeaver steals the show giving a performance of electrifying skill.\nIf you want to have a great night's entertainment, then come along, you\nwon't be disappointed.\nPS.

WhoDay is\nSFSoc'sTV science fiction\nconvention. Last year it was devoted\nentirely to Dr Who and the good Time\nLord will certainly be heavily featured\nthis year.

We don't promise to make you into millionaires\novernight, but I did hear he'd invented a method to win at\nblackjack...Oh yes, the AGM. Papers\nare up now (see Small Ads) and we\ndesperately need committee\nmembers.

Twenty students signed up\nfor the second course of this year and\nspent Wednesday and Thursday\nevenings doing ground training, and\non Saturday everyone got their first\njump. The weather was excellent and\nthe majority of the first timers got a second jump as well. Ian Muriss\nreally got his money's worth and\nmade his jump last twenty minutes\nlonger than anyone else's \u2014suspended\nhigh up in a tree. He wanted to a ovid the runway, so ran straight downwind\u2014into the tree. However he\nwasn't discouraged and went up for\nanother jump.\nWe hope to see all the new comers\ndown at Headcorn for future jumps.\nAnd don't forget your receipts.\nAs for the rest of us, when people\nlook like ants, you're alright but when\nants start looking like people, you're\nin trouble.\nFor anyone else that's interested,\nour meetings are on Tuesdays in the\nUnion Lounge.\nMax Hunt von Herbing.\nwill have guests who have featured in\nthe programme.

This is no play for the\nfaint of heart. It is unremitting ly gloomy in outlook and yet, through\nhis language and symbolism,\nStrindberg infuses it with a ghoulish\nbeauty.

This was also\napproved; Ms Taig and ICU Deputy\nPresident Jackie Peirce will be\nnegotiating a sum with College\nSecretary John Smith. This will be\nincluded as part of the annual Union\nsub vent ion. The U GM directive to pursue\n\u2022\" Union control of the JCR bar was also\ndiscussed. Mr Smith said that he\nwould prefer a profit share; the matter\nwas referred back to a special meeting\nof House Committee.\nOccupation\nEnds\nStudents at the London School of\nEconomics ended their week long\noccupation of Connaught House, the\nschool administration building on\nTuesday of this week. The\noccupation, which was in protest\nagainst the investment of more than\n10 per cent of LSE's assets in\ncompanies with South African links\nended peacefully after the schools\nadministration obtained a high court\ninjunction against the students.\nThe occupation was meticulously\norganised, with cooking rot as, cleaning rot as and security rot as. Smoking and drinking were barred,\noffices were opened up as study\nrooms and separate dormitories\narranged for men and women. Pete\nWilcox, General Secretary of LSE\nStudents' Union told FELIX that the\noccupation was for publicity\npurposes, rather than to cause long\nBoring Elections\nThe seven sabbatical candidates spoke\nto an unpacked Great Hall at the\nHustings UGM yesterday. After a short delay due to duplicating of\nminutes, the usual reports were\naccepted without question. Returning\nOfficer Dave Colley started the\nHustings but this was immediately\nin t erupted by a procedural motion to\nmove to an emergency motion, both\nproposed by Mark Cottle. This was\nopposed by Dave Lowrie who then\ncalled quorum when the procedural\nmotion was carried. A 'count'\nrevealed that there were 301 students\npresent making it quo rate. The\nemergency motion, which suggested\nthat the option of abstaining should\nbe allowed to be publicised, was\neventually passed.\nThe Returning Officer's report was\nthen continued with Bill Goodwin\nbeing the first Presidential candidate\nto speak. During this proposer Sarah\nAllsop was abducted. Mr Goodwin\nwas forced to conclude the speech\nhimself. Ian Howgate then spoke and\nthe two candidates answered written\nquestions, during which Miss Allsop\nwas rescued.\nThe rest of the Hustings was very\nboring.\n...and More Boring Elections\nThe Royal College of Science Union\nTop Five elections took place this\nMonday in all RCS departments.

No doubt they\nwere also aware of the huge fine for\ndamages that landed on the Sussex\nstudents at the end of their recent\noccupation.\nA spokesman for the school\npromised that a meeting would be\nheld with the protestors in the next\nfew days. \"We stand ready to talk\nwith the students, which was our\noriginal intention before the\noccupation,\" he said. The students\nhowever say that they have been\nlistening to talk for the last eleven\nyears, and were optimistic that the\nbad publicity would cause the school\nto rethink their position.\nFoxy\ngoings on\nLast Tuesday lunchtime several\nhundred people did not pack into the\nRead Lecture Theatre to hear a talk\nby Mr James Barrington of the\nLeague against Cruel Sports. Mr\nBarrington reviewed the arguments\nagainst fox and cub hunting using\npacks of hounds, saying that the\npractice was unnecessary and\ninhuman. He stressed that foxes were\nonly pests in lamb and free-range\npoultry farming, which accounted for\nless than 10% of the total agricultural\nindustry, and that numbers of foxes\nwere best controlled by environmental\nfactors such as territory size.\nSeveral slides of hunts were shown,\ndemonstrating their brutal nature\u2014\nhounds are being trained by allowing\nthem to tear cubs to pieces, and the\ndigging out of foxes that have gone\nto earth by sending down terriers to\nfight them. Mr Barrington argued that\nabolishing dog pack hunting,\nincluding, for example, mink, deer\nand hare hunting, need not result in\nunemployment of hunt servants and\nshooting of hounds (which are shot\nhalf-way through their natural life\nanyway) since artificially laid drag\ntrails could be used to give, in effect,\na bloodless hunt. Drag hunts would\nalso have the advantage of avoiding\nvaluable crops and domestic gardens\nwhere there is a danger of household\npets being killed by hounds.\nNo.4M rEo s^f lol s conical J vc\nsi**1\n- 1 JTO\n8jJ. t>o i ai5da j^S in\nPons!!\n\n"

    "content": "Manifestos FELIX, Friday March 6th19878 PRESIDENT Bill Goodwin, proposed by Sarah Allsop\nBill Goodwin is a second year undergraduate in the\nMechanical Engineering department. While at\nImperial College he has taken an active and\nconstructive role in the Union. As FELIX News\nEditor he has taken a strong interest in Union and\nExternal Affairs. These affect all students, not just\nhacks. Bill has also been acting President of QT\nSoc and an Ac-Rep in Mech-Eng. He was\nresponsible for producing the first 'Ac-Rep News'\nfor students in his year group, which many have\nfound useful. Bill has proved himself to be an able\ncandidate for President. He has the experience and\nability to bring about improvements for students\nnext year.\nSarah Allsop\nThe time for joking is over. The Union has been\nmisled too many times by joke candidates\nmasquerading as serious ones. It is too easy to be\nblinded by the seemingly credible rhetoric of\npower-crazed canvassing sycophants intent on ego-masturbation. However \"while they babble on about\nresidential impregnability and refectory boycotts,\nI have formulated a workable set of practical\npolicies that tear down all the old clich es. The\nduplicity of College administration and the\nimpression ability of Union Officers has led to us\nlosing large tracts of the JCR, ignoring the chance\nof gaining other rooms in Sherfield. We have been\ndistracted by facile arguments on the CCUs without\ntaking the time to look at how they really work.\nAt the same time we ignore important parts of IC\nsuch as Silwood Park and the gravel extraction at\nHarlington. These things are merely peripheral to\nthe standard campaigner who is more interested in\nthe winning than the thrill of the chase. Until, at\nthe de nou ment of every election we witness the\nschizophrenic simultaneous orgasm: the ejaculation\nof joy of the succesful candidate, and the cries of\nrelief of the crowd.\nBill Goodwin\nPRESIDENT Ian Howgate, proposed by Tom Brandon\nI have been a student at IC for almost four years\nnow and will be returning for a further year. In that\ntime I have been:\nCaptain of RSM Hockey Club;\nStudent Coordinator for the RSM\nOpenday;\nGeology Departmental Representative;\nStudent Residence Committee Union\nRepresentative.\nAt present I sit on ten student committees and\nfour College committees. As many Presidents have\nsaid their job involves a lot of boring committees.\nWell believe it or not I actually enjoy committees\nand general representational work.\nMy knowledge of Academic Affairs, Welfare and\nAccommodation is extensive, but I do need to work\non my knowledge of External Affairs. I have\ncomplete confidence in Alan Rose's ability to do\nthe DP's job and feel we can work together well.\nI have many plans for the Union, most of which\nwould bore the average student silly, but include;\nUnion reorganisation, pushing for better\naccommodation and sports facilities, continued\nimprovement of the College refectories and a drastic\nreorganisation of the entertainments machine to\nincorporate more C CU involvement and\nparticipation. I feel I have a good working\nrelationship with College staff and only a few days\nago Mr Northey agreed to give free chips away if\nI held UGMs in the JCR.\nThere is far too much of a 'College versus\nstudents' feeling at present and these barriers need\nto be broken down so we can all work together for\nthe best results.\nI became involved in the Union last year when\nI was so annoyed at the lack of representation I and\nfriends were getting in halls and in my department\nthat I took up these jobs myself. I now wish to work\nfor all of you to make this College a better place\nfor everyone.\nPlease remember that even though there are only\ntwo candidates it is still very important to vote.\nIan Howgate\nHON SECRETARY Symon Corns, proposed by Mark Ball\nI 've known Symon for nearly three years, and have\nbeen impressed by his involvement, enthusiasm and\ncommitment to a job. He is also well-versed in\nUnion matters and pretty friendly to boot.\nSymon Corns is the perfect candidate for the job,\nand I urge you all to vote for him.\nMark Ball\nHello. My name is Symon Corns, and I'm standing\nfor ICU Honorary Secretary, because quite simply\nI feel that I'm the best person for the job. I'm a final year Chemical Engineer, and in my four years\nat College I 've been involved in both Guilds Union\n(as Vice-President last year I was involved in\ncommittee work, administration and finance as well\nas organising and running events) and IO Union\n(I 've been on Rag Committee, Transport\nCommittee\u2014transport is a major area of\nresponsibility for the Hon Sec\u2014and the Union's governing body, Council). I thus consider myself\nto be ideally experienced for the post.\nThe whole structure of ICU is under review, and\nit is very possible that next year the Hon See's responsibilities will be radically changed, and it is\nhere that my wide range of experience will be\ninvaluable, as it will help me to undertake whatever\nextra responsibilities come my way.\nImperial College Union should provide a service\nto every student at IC and I would try to ensure\nthis, both in my individual capacity as Hon Sec and\nas an Executive Officer of the Union. Officers must\nnot allow themselves to become bogged down in\nself-interest and bureaucracy whilst the 'ordinary'\nstudent suffers. We should be electing someone to\nhelp run an organisation for the benefit of us all.\nI believe that I am that person.\nI hope that I can count on your vote. Thank you.\nSymon Corns\n\n"

    "content": "SABBATICAL ELECTION MANIFESTO SPECIAL Your vote counts!\nHon Sec extra ordinaire Dave Colley gives a beginner's guide to voting in next week's sabbatical elections.\nInside: lies, damned lies and manifestos from all this year's sabbatical candidates except for Alan Rose who was returned unopposed as Deputy President and was too lazy to write anything. This year is a good one as far as\ncounting votes goes, as there are no\nmore than two people running for any\nof the sabbatical posts. Although this\nshould make the voting easier too, it's amazing how many people still\nmanage to cock the whole process up\nand spoil their votes. This might\nsound a trifle patronising, but from\nmy experience this year and last,\npeople still change their minds even\nwhen only two candidates are\nrunning, and ruin votes.\nThe STV (Single Transferable\nVote) system of marking the ballot\npapers will be employed. This\ninvolves putting numbers, beginning\nwith one (1) and ending (this year and\nlast) with two (2) (of course you don't have to put a2 down if you don't want\nto.)\nA student goes to vote\nStudent doesn't want to vote for A candidate but prefers B candidate.\nCandidate A Candidate B1 If student prefers A candidate to B candidate\nCandidate A1 Candidate B If you think the other candidate is a good candidate but not as good as the\ncandidate you voted first for then put\na two (2) in their box\nCandidate A Candidate B1 If it is a dead heat after the first count,\nthen the number of people who put\n2's in will count, so that the majority\nof people's wishes are accounted for.\nAnother legitimate, recognised\noption is the abstention. To abstain\nfrom the election the voter must write\n\"ABSTAIN\" across the ballot paper.\nThis is the only spelling of the word\nthat will be accepted (it will be printed\non the ballot paper, so that's easy.)\nLots of people think abstaining is\nruining or spoiling a vote, this is not\nso. If both candidates in your opinion\nare 'real div s' then don't vote for\nthem and abstain. If enough people\nfeel the same way then they'll abstain\nand if the amount of people who\nabstain is more than the number of\nvalid votes cast for both candidates\nthen the election must be re-run from\nthe beginning ie papers go up again\nso others can stand.\nDo not write anything else on the\nballot paper other than that which has\nbeen explained above. Ifyou do, your\nvote will be totally disregarded.\nSummary\n1. Vote in order of preference using\nnumbers: 1,2.\n2. Write \"ABSTAIN\" if both\ncandidates are unacceptable to you.\n3. Bring your Union Card with you\nor you won't be able to vote.\nVALID PAPERS\nCandidate A Candidate B1 Candidate A1 Candidate B2 Candidate A* Candidate B NOT VALID PAPERS\nCandidate A X Candidate B Candidate A4 Candidate B3 \u2022e Candidate Bj< s Candidate A Candidate B "
