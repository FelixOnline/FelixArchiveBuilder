    "content": "Hey, why so glum? At least you\u2019re\nnot here being Santa at a Christmas party in April. Urk.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t my fault, officer, it went\noff in my hand. He threw himself\nonto my blade. I was in Wisconsin\nat the time. Somehow, it occurred\nto me that this wouldn\u2019t stand up in\ncourt. Oh well. I wasn\u2019t planning on\nstaying in this den of depravity long\nenough to get caught, anyway.\nI stood there, the enormity of\nwhat I\u2019ve done failing to impact on\nmy consciousness. In front of me,\nhis lifeblood seeping into the cracks\nbetween the kitchen tiles, lay a fat\nold man in a white-fur-trimmed\nred suit. He had a knife stuck grotesquely into his forehead, and I just\nstood and watched the crimson pool\nspread out from him. Strangely...\ndispassionate. I\u2019d just killed Santa.\nBut morals weren\u2019t really a consid-eration. So I stripped his whitening,\nlifeless body, pulled on his cheerful\nand miraculously clean festive suit\nstocked up on more kitchen knives,\nand went on my way.\nAlso fated to die that snowy night\nwere two slickly-suited security\nguards, an irritatingly yappy black\nterrier, a disgraced senator\u2019s son,\nand an aging adult film tycoon. At\nthat point, though, I didn\u2019t know all\nof this. I knew only that I had a job\nto do and that a lot of people might\ndie before it was done. But that was\nalright. It was all for the money,\neh?\nMassive stainless steel razor-sharp kitchenware hidden safely in\nmy garters, which also contained\nmy emergency survival kit (pass-port, syringe, three pounds of plastic explosive, silenced pistol, Euros,\nthe usual), I proceeded inconspicuously in my bright red costume to\nmy first target. He was on the upper\nfloor of his mansion, and while none\nof the drunken party guests with a\nraging libido seemed to care that\na six foot barcoded bald man was\ngoing around in a Father Christmas suit with suspiciously bulging\npockets, the security guards were\nless apathetic. Or possibly less dis-tracted, it\u2019s hard to say. However,\na little creative wardrobe changing (and one unconscious pornographic photographer) ensured my\npassage to the upper levels. I didn\u2019t\nstay long. Only long enough to slit\nthree throats and brutally execute\nthat annoying canine with a shot to\nits head.\nDownstairs once again, I slipped\ninto my morbidly unseasonal getup once more, and took to the out-Cutting it fine\ndoors, where bikini-clad \u2018actresses\u2019\nshivered and attempted to entertain my second target, the prodigal son who would never return\nto taste the fatted calf. In fact, the\nonly thing the poor sod was to taste\nwas the blood in his mouth after my\nknife embedded itself into his brain\nfrom ten feet away. In the confusion\nthat followed, I slipped out, in my\ncrisp suit once more. No-one would\never know who was behind the\nChristmas Porn Mansion murders.\nBut I put it behind me. That was in\nthe past now. I had another half a\ndozen hits to carry out in the next\nhour and a half, three more cans of\ncider, a good supply of gingerbread,\nit was dark and I was wearing\nsunglasses.\nHit it.\nIs that a small explosive device in your pocket?\nA redneck wedding \u2013 it\u2019s every little\nboy\u2019s dream. Fittingly, then, Agent\n47 spruces himself up in the clothes\nof a drunken southener (America,\nnot England, obviously. They don\u2019t\ndrink down there.) and slips his way\ninside.\nIt\u2019s the bride that\u2019s hired us for\ntoday\u2019s job \u2013 to take out the groom\nand his father and let her get on\nwith the job of partly-organised\ncrime. The guards are patrolling,\nthe \u2018gators are in the water, and\nthe yokels are doing their dancing.\nI join in for a little bit, but then get\ndisturbed at the sight of a bald killer\ndoing the jive, and move on.\nThe mansion\u2019s looking pretty spif-fy. Clean, white panelling, pianos,\nalluring guests. The priest is also\nlooking quite spiffy too, so it\u2019s off to\nknock him upside the head and take\nhis clothes. And his large, hollowed-out Bible.\nHis very large Bible, with an interesting compartment in the center.\nNo-one notices that the priest has\nnow become considerably more\nangry-looking, and has a barcode\ntattooed onto the back of his skull.\nNo-one notices during the ceremony that I\u2019m cradling a detonator. In\nfact, everyone seems pretty unconcerned when the bible is launched\ninto the congregation, towards the\ngroom, and explodes violently.\nExcept the members of the crowd\non fire, who are understandably\nirritated.\nMost of the hillbillies are running\nscared now, the guards don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going on, and the father \u2013 lovingly known as \u2018Pappy\u2019 \u2013 is staggering around the mansion in shock.\nThey\u2019re eyeing me up very closely,\nbut I\u2019m not clear to leave yet, so I\nswagger in through the front doors\nagain and hop upstairs to the attic.\nThe attic, for some reason, is full\nof guards. Not to worry though, they\nsee priests in lofts all the time, I\u2019m\njust exorcising spirits and the like. I\nleave a holy remote mine on a consecrated chandelier bolt, and then\namble my way downstairs.\nThey noticed. They take their\ntime informing me of this, of course,\nso by the time I\u2019m standing in the\nhallway, watching Pappy stagger\nthe last steps down the stairs to\nthe crushing point, everyone in the\nroom pulls a piece out.\nTime freezes momentarily, as the\nexpression on Pappy\u2019s face changes from sorrow into a mixed anger/\nconfusion/did-I-get-him-insured\nand he steps onto the lower half of\nthe staircase.\nIn a beautiful split-second move-ment, I pull the trigger on the det-onator, burst out of the door, and\ndraw my dual Silverballers. Behind\nme, the sound of crashing glass\nand screaming. In front of me, my\nspeedboat, and a drunk, naked red-neck. Action!\nFather Christmas, caught in the act of the teapot dance.

    "content": "10 felix Friday 26 January 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nChemical warfare \u2013 biobricking it\nAs developments in synthetic biology advance, should we concern ourselves with potential bioterrorism?\n\u201cSynthetic biology is like genetic\nengineering on steroids,\u201d says Dr\nDoreen Stabinsky of Greenpeace\nInternational. Although the first international conference on synthetic\nbiology occurred as recently as\n2005, the field has already attracted\na lot of outside attention. Synthetic\nbiologists talk of the advantages\ntheir discipline promises to bring.\nGreenpeace and others worry that\nthe science is too dangerous. The\nfuture of synthetic biology rests on\nwhether the public decides that the\nbenefits outweigh the costs. And\nthe battle for the public\u2019s hearts\nand minds has already begun.\nAt the heart of synthetic biology\nare \u2018biobricks\u2019. Each biobrick reliably performs a function, be it as\na generator, a terminator, or anything in between. By connecting a\nnumber of these biobricks together,\nand inserting them into the genome\nof living cells, synthetic biologists\ncan produce an organism that carries out a specific function. The\npotential applications are numer-ous: living organisms designed to\nproduce medicines cheaply, manufacture biofuels, even dispose of unwanted industrial waste.\nThat\u2019s the theory, anyway: until\nrecently synthetic biology was confined largely to the page. That has\nnow changed. In November last\nyear, synthetic biologists, including a team from Imperial, met in\nBoston to mark the culmination of\niGEM 2006, an international synthetic biology competition. \u201cThe\nbig thing that happened [in Boston]\nwas that the central question, \u2018can\nyou build biological systems from\nstandard parts?\u2019 got a resounding\n\u2018yes\u2019,\u201d says James Brown, a synthetic biology PhD student at the\nUniversity of Cambridge and an\nambassador for iGEM. \u201cThe fact\nthat stuff works now is a really big\ndeal,\u201d he continues.\nMany of the competing teams had\nadvanced beyond the theoretical\nstage and succeeded in producing\npractical working models. Most im-pressively, those working models\nwere the results of just a few weeks\u2019\nwork over the summer holiday. This\nhighlights one of the major advantages of the new science. Little\nexpertise is needed to produce sophisticated systems. Biobricks are\nglorified Lego blocks. The manner\nin which each biobrick work is un-important; the researcher needs\nonly to stick them together. This is\nplug-and-play science.\nBut it is precisely this advantage\nthat is the cause of so much concern elsewhere. In 2005, synthetic\nbiologists managed to reconstruct\nKrystyna Larkham\nScience Editor\nthe 1918 \u2018flu virus from its DNA. Research using the reconstructed virus will inform any strategy to fight\navian \u2018flu. The latest promising results were published in Nature last\nweek. Ultimately, millions could be\nsaved from the effects of a global\n\u2018flu pandemic, but at the cost of\nresurrecting one of the most lethal\nviruses on record. And, as Jamie\nShreeve commented in the New\nYork Times last year, \u201cThe wonder,\nand for some the fear, is that they\ncould [resurrect the virus] with so\nlittle effort or expense.\u201d The concern is that bioterrorists might\nalso desire to construct deadly\npathogens along the lines of Spanish \u2018flu. Synthetic biology could\nprovide them with the means to do\nso, without the need for specialist\nknowledge.\n\u201cSynthetic biologists do scare\npeople,\u201d James Brown admits. \u201cWe\nshould be willing to talk about that\nand stand up and be responsible.\u201d\nAnd to their credit, this is exactly\nwhat the synthetic biologists are do-ing. An entire day of a recent seven-ty-two hour conference (\u2018Synthetic\nBiology 2.0\u2019) was set aside to debate\nethics. The result was the adoption of a code of self-governance to\nguard against malpractice, similar\nto that adopted by the pioneering\ngenetic engineers in the 1970s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very open science. We\u2019re\ntrying to steer clear of any images\nof \u2018mad scientists\u2019 creeping around\nin a cave, to avoid attack by journalists,\u201d says Matthieu Bultelle, a\nmember of Imperial\u2019s iGEM team.\nBut is this self-regulation enough?\nSome are not so sure: a host of or-ganisations, including Greenpeace,\ntried to discourage scientists from\nsigning the self-governance document (which, in any case, is a voluntary code) arguing that what is\nneeded is official regulation by national government. They worry that\nscientists acting alone will be unable to regulate such a potentially\nsensitive field.\nThe debate continues. A recent\nreport by the Sloan Foundation is\nthe latest to address synthetic biol-ogy. Interestingly, the Sloan Report\nwas commissioned by the scientists\nthemselves rather than by worried\ncampaign groups. Evidently the\nsynthetic biologists are not prepared to surrender the PR initiative just yet. Instead they are steeling themselves for the moment that\nsynthetic biology registers on the\npublic radar.\nIt is the response that the science receives in the wider community which will determine its future.\nAnd, according to James Brown,\nthe scientists are ready for the\nfight: \u201cWe want public debate. We\nwant the world to know about this\nbecause it\u2019s so important. I genuinely believe synthetic biology is\ngoing to have a big impact.\u201d\nAn H5N1 influenza carrier \u2013 not so cute after all. However, can biobricks help prevent this guy from slaughter and the next global pandemic?\nGreenpeace activists, possibly campaigning against the dangers of synthetic biology\n\n"

Felix is\nprevented from commenting on the\nperformance of staff members specifically by the Staff-Student Protocol (see page 4), but can comment\non the changes made by the division as a whole.\nThe EPoS system was designed\nto improve stock control in the bar\nand to increase service speed. Installing the EPoS system was a key\nfactor in deciding to change the way\nthe bars are managed, a new post\nof Trading Manager was created\n(which was filled by early November). This new position oversees all\nof the Union bars and catering.\nThis led to a review of the bar\nmanagers\u2019 positions, as much of\ntheir work was now rolled into the\nTrading Manager position and the\nEPoS system. The staff filling these\npositions were offered pay cuts,\ntransfer to other positions, or voluntary redundancy. The three bar\nmanagers chose to take the redundancy package.\nDuring this consultation period,\nthe student media (Felix and Live!)\nwere prevented from commenting\nby employment law, despite cries\nfrom the student staff about the\nredundancies.\nThe student bar staff are classed\nas \u2018casual\u2019 staff and were therefore\nnot included in the consultation.\nMany at the time expressed their\ndissatisfaction with the departure\nof the three bar managers, whom\nthey felt loyal to, and raised their\nconcerns with the sabbs and senior\nmembers of Commercial Services.\nThis reporter heard many criticisms of the way the student staff\nwere treated, with many struggling\nto find out what would be happening to their managers.\nMany of the experienced student\nstaff then chose to leave once the\nbar managers had taken redundan-cy, citing their dissatisfaction with\nthe whole process. This left the\nbars in a poor state, with the communal atmosphere behind the bar\ndegenerating to the point of alleged\nsabotage of systems to hamper the\nnewly arrived Trading Manager.\nThe new staff lacked experience,\nand this lead to a plummet in the\nquality of bar service (this reporter\nhas had trouble getting a full pint\npulled most days).\nThe new Trading Manager has\nbeen left to deal with this situation.\nHowever, things are slowly improving \u2013 training is continuing for the\nnew bar staff, and a number of other improvements have been seen in\nthe bars, such as new furniture, an\nincrease in catering quality, the introduction of new house wines, and\nthe long-awaited introduction of\nchips to the bar (this reporter likes\nthat a lot).\nThe EPoS system has so far\nproved less than satisfactory. Both\nold and new bar staff have commented to Felix that the tills are\nmuch slower than the old cash tills\n(requiring scrolling through a long\nmenu for the correct drinks item)\nand restrict staff to serving a single customer at a time. The tills,\nwhich are Windows-based, are also\nprone to crashing mid-service due\nto a software bug. Even sabbaticals\nhave been critical of the current\nstate of the system after working\nbehind the bar in recent weeks.\nThe tills are also not connected\nacross the Union core, meaning\nthe dBs and da Vinci\u2019s tills operate\nindependently, though wiring is apparently in place.\nThe server, which the tills report\nto, has cost much more than previously reported (as \u201clow hundreds\u201d)\nto the Executive Committee and is\nStaff find the new EPoS system slow and crash-prone, and with many experienced student bar staff having\nleft in sympathy with members of Union staff who took redundancy during the management reshuffle\ncurrently without a backup system.\nAdditionally, the Executive Committee believed that the new EPoS\nsystem would be compatible with\nthe new \u201ccashless\u201d (pay by \u2018smart\u2019\nswipe card) system the College\nhas been investigating; however,\nit now appears that implementing\ncompatibility between the Union\nand College systems could be very\nexpensive.\nMany of these facts came to light\nthrough comments made on an\narticle on Live!, the City & Guilds\nonline newspaper (available at live.\ncgcu.net). The article concerned\nthe motion of no confidence in\nWHAT...\nWHAT?\nINVISIBLE BIKE!\nthe Deputy President (Graduate\nStudents), Shama Rahman. However, the comments on the article\nquickly developed into a free-for-all on the sabbs and Commercial\nServices on the way the restructing\nwas handled. At the time of going to\npress, the article had more than 100\ncomments.\nMany of the disgruntled commentators questioned the original\nreasons for the restructuring of the\nbars, citing the fact that the bars are\nturning over a healthy profit. The\nUnion shop, however, lost around\n\u00a37,000 last year, and online regalia\nsales faring poorly, with \u00a326,000 of\nstock written off over the last few\nyears; this has drawn the attention\nof the Union\u2019s auditors.\nAny change is of course fraught\nwith difficulty, and things have not\nturned out as bad as they could\nhave.\nThere are still a number of issues\nto be resolved, such as the role of\nthe Union shop and separate online\nshop, the EPoS bugs and the training of new staff to replace the experienced staff.\nFor another perspective on the\nbar restructuring, see page 4.\nAndy Sykes\n\n"

Absolutely not.\nThis is a snapshot from the event\nthat took place in the Union Dining\nHall last Saturday, when the newly\nformed Computer Games Club\n(CGC) held its first event of the\nyear \u2013 a LAN (Local Area Network)\nparty.\nFrom 10am, people came streaming into the dining hall armed to the\nteeth. Most of them had laptops,\nbut the more enthusiastic ones\neven had desktops brought in with\nthem. After a quick sign-up, bags\nwere ripped opened, various kinds\nof computers came buzzing to life\nand gaming mice were whipped up\nonto the tables. It was time to find\nout whose mouse control was the\nbest, and who could think on their\nbutts as CounterStrike and DotA\n(Warcraft III: Frozen Throne\u2019s Defence of the Ancients) teams were\nassembled.\nFor the next 6 hours, only the\nlow humming sounds from the\ncomputers, the periodic taps on\nthe keyboards and furious clicking on the mice could be heard.\nOf course, there were the rather\nfrequent swear words that echoed\nthrough the room whenever someone \u2018died\u2019.\nThis is what happened at the\nCGC\u2019s first big event last Saturday.\nFor anyone who has missed it, rest\nassured, there\u2019s more future frag-ging to be had..\nThe CGC was founded only early\nthis year by a group of gaming en-thusiasts, the majority of whom are\nin their 3rd year of study at Imperial College.\nThe aim of CGC is to promote the\nidea of LAN gaming to everyone.\nLAN gaming is a simple process\nwhereby people connect their computers to this huge \u2018box\u2019 and Lo and\nBehold!, they are all wired up and\nready to play head to head against\none another.\nCGC also aims to create a platform where all gamers of Imperial\nCollege can unite and play together.\nThere will be meetings, or rather,\ngaming sessions held regularly so\nthat members can meet up and enjoy gaming as a cohort. Instead of\nplaying games with strangers over\nthe internet and having nightmares\nabout how your opponent looks like,\nwith CGC, you can actually see who\nyou are playing with. Also, you will\nknow who the bugger who ended\nyour killing spree was and be able\nto order a pie to be smashed into\nhis face the next time the Union\nruns a hit squad.\nBelieve it or not, gaming actually\nfosters teamwork and allows people to understand the personality of\ntheir gaming peers. In multiplayer\ngames, people are forced to work as\na team in order to win, and this kind\nof co-operation and teamwork can\nbe applied to other areas of life, like\nin studies or at work.\nBut it\u2019s not just questionable\nhealth benefits. Have you ever\nthought what a loser the nerd sitting behind you could be? Well,\nnerd or not, he might just hand you\nyour butt on a silver platter when\nyou meet him in the virtual fighting world! Besides, you can also\nfind out who amongst you are the\nselfish, self-serving trouble makers\nwho only care about their own safe-ty, or find the heroes that will lay\ntheir lives down to rescue a team\nmate in need.\nCGC is not just a club for gam-ers; it is a club by gamers. Thus, if\nyou are new to gaming or if you are\nafraid to start due to the fear that\nCounter-Strike remains one of the most popular games for competitive play, and was a firm favourite at the LAN event. Prefer other games? Email the society and suggest them\nthose proud experts will start owning you, CGC is here to your rescue!\nCGC has provisions for novice gam-ers, and will teach you from scratch\nhow various game systems work,\nand what you can do to improve\nyour gaming. You do not have to\nworry about people calling you a\n\u2018newbie\u2019 or \u2018feeder\u2019 since all novices will start playing from ground\nzero. When you yourself feel that\nyou are of the appropriate stand-ard, you are most welcome to join\nthe higher level gamers and test\nout your mettle.\nCGC may not have the best gam-ers, but when many good gamers\ncome together, the ultimate gaming\nexperience can be created.\nCGC may still be a young club, but\nplans for the future have already\nbeen made. Come March, there will\nbe tournaments for 2 popular multiplayer games \u2013 CounterStrike and\nDotA. Needless to say, attractive\nAfter such a long read, what\nare you waiting for?

There he worked\nas a photojournalist, as well as\nspending a year as a gigolo for an\nolder woman.\nIn the early 1940s he moved to\nAustralia, where he met his wife\nJune. Although he enjoyed living in\nAustralia, he found there was a lack\nof inspiration, and in 1957 moved\nto London. However he found this\n\"equally sterile and unproductive.\"\nHe found the environmental stimuli he needed in Paris, moving there\nin the late 1950s. Newton comment-ed, \"The moment I hit Paris I knew\nit was for living and taking photo-graphs. The life was in the streets,\nin cafes, restaurants. Beautiful\nwomen seemed to be everywhere.\"\nIt was after suffering a major\nheart attack in 1971 that Helmut\nshows a model standing with her\nhips thrust forward, wearing only a\nleg cast and neck brace, and holding a cane. Feminists found this\noffensive, arguing that it shows\nthat Newton feels women should\nbe vulnerable, and are the weaker\nsex. However it could also be interpreted as admiration of how strong\nwomen can overcome adversity.\nThe woman is weakened by the cast\nand brace, but she stands strongly.\nIndeed in his fashion shoots Helmut\nfavoured athletically built women,\ntelling Vogue's fashion editor \"Don't\nsend me any of your scrawny undernourished models\". A contrast with\nmany fashion advertisements and\neditorials today, and also during the\nheroin chic period, which favoured\nmalnourished passive 13-year-olds\nstaring blankly at the camera. It\ncan also be seen as a critique of\nfashion, how women hurt themselves in their pursuit of fashion, or\nindeed a critique of consumerism in\ngeneral. Another signature of Newton's photos is that there is never\nany eye-contact between groups of\nwomen. You can see echoes of this\nin recent advertisements by Dolce\n& Gabbana; like in Helmut's photos,\nthe men do not make eye contact\nwith each other. They all compete\nagainst each other, not daring to\nacknowledge that anyone is more\nattractive than themselves.\nOne of Newton's most controversial images is of the saddled woman\n\n"

You may\nhave noticed a lack of things nocturnally related in the last two\nissues of Felix, this is due to two\nthings.\nFirstly, we don\u2019t have enough re-viewers! We need you lovely people to go forth and party for the\nname of journalism (and so I can\nmake a page without actually writing anything myself) - first years,\nI\u2019m looking at you. I know for a\nfact that you go out to clubs some\nnights of the week, so why not do\nit all for free? Some lucky reviewers last year even got unlimited\nbar tabs at the venues they were\nvisiting - all for a simple 700 word\nreview! You can go anywhere you\nlike, just email us to the address\nat the top of the page suggesting\nwhere you\u2019d like to check out.\nThe second reason why there\nwas no Nightlife sections in the\nlast two issues is that I have decided to make this page bi-monthly:\nfirstly, I don\u2019t have the time to devote to making the page look nice\nevery week and secondly, it makes\nit more interesting because we\nhave more material to print! Anyway, that\u2019s it for now. Officially the\nmost boring editorial ever, so read\nthe articles now.\nWelcome\nback\n\u2018dudes\u2019\nGregory Mead\nNightlife Editor\nReach for the LaZers. Ferry\nCorsten hits Turnmills\nFelix goes armed with a healthy supply of glowsticks and, of course, plenty of water to\ncheck out the Dutch Trance master spinning the decks for a thumping four hour set\nvery much called for encore.\nThe atmosphere in Turnmills was\nvery friendly from the shades-wear-ing,tank topcladgayguystotheglo-stick spinning hardcore shufflers:\neveryone was smiling and seemed\nto be having the time of their lives\nwhich can best be summed up from\nthe track Beautiful: Everything is\nbeautiful, Let the music carry you,\nMaybe i will follow you, forever!,\nNowhere else I\u2019d rather be, When\nyou\u2019re lying next to me, Let the music carry us, together!..\nEveryone seemed to be in love\nwith everyone else while being absolutely amazed in their trance-like\nstate with the laser lights! Needless\nto say the atmosphere on the dance\nfloor was purely euphoric.\nThe main room was full to capac-ity, not really surprising as it is miniscule for a house-club standard.\nFor those of you who have never\nbeen to Turnmills, it is a medium-sized club (yes, smaller than FabThe end of Trash club\nFor the past ten years Trash has\nbeen hosting the coolest night-spot for anybody who thinks they\nare somebody in the \u2018indie\u2019 music\nscene.\nBeing one of the most fashionable\nclubs in town means the girl on the\ndoor can pick and choose who en-ters, and towards midnight at the\nlast ever Trash she really had her\nwork cut out. It seemed that half\nthe entire population of London\nwanted to be there, the queue working its way round the block and further even 2 hours before the place\nopened.\nI turned up rather late, and most\nof the people trying to get in once\nthey\u2019d reached capacity were total\narseholes, and the fact the police\nturned up at one point with three\nvans to arrest a large proportion of\nthe queue only confirmed this.\nYou might think from reading this\nthat everyone was going to be a\ntwat in the club, but it was in fact\nthe complete opposite, the reason\nall the scenester-coke head toss-ers were outside was because they\nwere not getting let in. The Trash\ncrew did an excellent job of only letting true music fans in for the final\nnight, and made absolutely sure\nthey didn\u2019t overcrowd the place,\nwhich resulted in what I believe\nwas the best night I\u2019ve ever been\nto at The End Club. Erol was DJing\nthe whole night after about mid-night, playing his usual mish mash\nof electro, indie, new-wave and anything else, only this week he only\nplayed the total classics. Basically\nawesome.\nThey opened the entire venue up\nfor the final event, which was the\nonly time I\u2019d seen it that way and\ngave it a capacity of 850 fans. Everyone was happy and I it seemed\neveryone I bumped into I rec-ognised, which made for a great\nfriendly atmosphere. The Arctic\nMonkeys even decided to turn up\nat one point, and I must say, they\ndo not look good on the dance floor,\nthey dance like retards. Apparently\nI also met one of the guys from\nSoulwax in there too but I don\u2019t really remember that part too well. I\ngive this night 5/5 easily. By the way,\nthe last song was Abba - Dancing\nQueen. Some of the more emotional\n(drunk?) Trashsters actually cried,\nwhich shows how highly some peo-Ferry Corsten + Guests\nTurnmills\nFriday 19 January\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nric\u2019s warehouse-like club) with\nthree small-ish main rooms and a\nfew ante-rooms in between, dotted\nwith lounge chairs. It has a very\nquaint ambience with a maze like\nquality to it not for the claustropho-bic. And if not for the state-of-the-art sound system blasting thumped\nup tunes, few high and mighty rav-ers could make it back to the dance\nfloors.\nAnotherthingworthmentioningis\nthe efficiency of how they work and\nthe friendliness of the staff; bouncers and bartenders alike. They did\nnot gave us any trouble when one of\nmy friends forgot to bring the credit\ncard with which she purchased her\ntickets on-line, or when I asked for\na replacement cloakroom ticket after losing mine.\nThe drink prices however, were\nmuch to be desired being at the upper end of the scale (\u00a39 for a double\nshot!) and they seemed to run out\nof tequila before 2am.\nUndeniably there are other DJs\nspinning in the other rooms, with\nTristan Da Cuhna (BackToBasics),\nDave Mills (Cool House) and Tania\nvon Pear (the Gallery) spinning in\nRoom 2 and John Rundell, Dave\nRandall, James Kinetic and Thermobee DJing in Room 3. Good as\nI\u2019m sure they are, they\u2019re no Ferry\nso to be perfectly honest I did not\nspend time outside of Room 1 at all,\nsave for the occasional toilet break\nto fill up my water bottle.\nWe left the place at 7am, but even\nthe terrible rainy English weather\ncould not dampen our satisfaction\nafter a night of trance by the great\nDutch Trance master. With great\nbig names in the Trance genre finally returning, I could not help but\nfeel that the clubbing scene in London is finally looking up. Paul Van\nDyk will be playing in two weeks\u2019\ntime in Turnmills and I fully intend\nto be there.\nSyaza Md Taib\nI\u2019m on a mission,\nLet me take you back and forth,\nI got a jam that\u2019s gonna make you\nscream for more.\nFrom New York London to\nAmsterdam,\nLet\u2019s rock, I wanna rock your body\nRock!\nSingingalongtothisepictune,heart\npumping, hand-swaying in the air\nalong with other happy people, I experienced true happiness last Friday when the Gallery in Turnmills\nwitnessed one of the demi-gods in\nTrance, Ferry Corsten, DJ and pro-ducer, spinning a four-hour set supported by Spanish superstar Abel\nRamos, and the Gallery resident\nGavyn Mytchell.\nHarry Brown (who?) gave his\nbest prepping the dance floor from\n1030pm to an audience who were\npolitely disguising their disinterest\nbut by 1am, around the time Ferry\u2019s due on the decks, clubbers who\ncame from all over the country from\nWales to Nottingham started chanting for Ferry to take the decks and\nput this poor soul out of his misery.\nFerry did not disappoint by spinning one infectious track after another mainly from his latest album\nL.E.P (Loud, Electronic, Ferocious)\nto the delight of the very ecstatic\nravers. It was definitely loud, electronic and ferocious when he spun\nnew tracks as well as updated versions of his earlier works like Junk\nand Beautiful and he kept the crowd\ngoing all night (or morning).\nI wanna make you feel like\nyou\u2019re on fire (the vocal tunes from\nthe track Fire) and the world class\nDJ did just that to the delight of the\nfrenzied crowd.

    "content": "Perk of peeing in sink: it\u2019s hands free\nNonsensical title leading the way in music journalism, you saw it here first, kids\nI knew it was going to be difficult reviewing a gig from a Carling venue\nfollowing the last Deftones album\n(coincidently they\u2019re playing Brixton Academy in April). I arrived just\nin time for the ominously titled Misery Signals set. In fact, they were\nbetter than a lot things I have seen,\neven if from where I was standing\nthey were playing pretty straight-up, run-of-the-mill \u2018hXc\u2019, complete\nwith idiotic hardcore dancing in the\npit.\nMinor entertainments aside, I\novercame my typically antisocial\nways to chat with a few Imperial\npeople. Like most people in the\naudience, they\u2019d come mainly to\nsee the second act, tech-metallers\nBetween the Buried and Me (the\nname in fact is taken from a song\nby Counting Crowes), or BTBAM\nas I shall refer to them for sake of\nspace. As their set began, the lead\nsinger sprang into life with an unnerving ferocity, eyes glazed like a\nlunatic, whilst the talented instrumentalists let rip with the kind of\nrobotic precision that made one\nwonder whether they were actually watching some kind of ornate\nmechanism. Forgetting the fantastic show that they were putting on,\none could easily think that these\nguys had day jobs in accountancy.\nAnd then their set finished, painfully short for my liking. A short\ntime passed while the awe faded,\nand Darkest Hour spilled out\nonto the stage, more like a ragtag\nbunch of random blokes pulled of\nthe street then the campy gothic\nnonsense of Atreyu and their ilk.\nThey then proceeded to belt out\nan intense string of powerful songs\nwith virtually no let-up, easily grabbing the audience attention, even if\nthey were a little too reminiscent\nof Slaughter of the Soul era At the\nGates for me. Ostensibly a \u2018metalcore\u2019 show, though one at least that\nshowed the true variety of some of\nthe more underground, and dare I\nsay it under-rated bands.\nAlex McKitrick\nRemember to wash your hands after\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nG\nood riddance to\n2006! It really, really sucked for music\nand don\u2019t try arguing with me on this.\nAfter looking at the inevitable\nend-of-year-best-of-compilation-column-fodders, I can\u2019t believe I\ndidn\u2019t give up on music last year.\nIt was a year where noise and\nfree-folk gained more ground in\npeople\u2019s record collections \u2013 I, for\none, enjoyed Raccoo-oo-oon\u2019s Is\nNight People amongst a few other\ngems. However, the sheer amount\nof noise bands both reinforced a\nDIY aesthetic and made most of\nthe ideas of noise redundant. The\nmore sparse and ambient experiments in noise caught my attention by way of My Cat Is An Alien;\nrecent discovery called Tiger Piss\ndelighted and intrigued me in\nequal measure.\nFree-folk and folk-inspired\nthings did interest me with the\nemergence of James Blackshaw\nand the plaintive Hush Arbors. I\nthink 2006 was a year for the increase in the role of DIY; various\npromoters gained more momen-tum. With the major labels trying\nto save face through signing anything with guitars in and increasing their presence on the internet\n(yet not changing their business\nplan), hopefully more power will\nbe given back to listeners. We\nneed a fucking revolution, we need\nsomething akin to 1976!\nThere were a few gems last year\nthat kept me going: Styne Vallis by\nReigns (West Country electronica\nwith live instruments with, yes,\ntunes); This Ain\u2019t A Hate Thing,\nIt\u2019s A Love Thing by Lords (fan-tastic blues riffs by way of Captain\nBeefheart with off-kilter time and\nstructure); I Am Not Afraid Of You\nAnd I Will Beat Your Ass by Yo La\nTengo (awful title, brilliant return\nto form); Ys by Joanna Newsom (if\nyou are not put off by her voice \u2013 I\nwas at first \u2013 then you will appreciate magic happening).\nOne last thing. I recommend\nyou come along to the Union (dB\u2019s\nmore specifically) on Saturday\n27th January at 8pm (tomorrow)\nfor a night of sumptuous music in\nthe way of the Kids Will Be Skeletons club-night. Restlesslist will\nbe headlining and they make in-die-alt-hip-hop and feature members of The Brakes and Electric\nSoft Parade. There are two more\nbands and it costs just \u00a34 for stu-dents; this is cheap, believe me.\nDarkest Hour\nCarling Academy Islington\nlive review\nNegura Bunget\nOM\n(code666 records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nalbum review\nIn conjunction with the recent additions to the EU, I thought reviewing an album from Romania would\nmake some sense. Few people\nreading this would have known for\ninstance that Bucharest has a burgeoning hip-hop scene, or heard\nany music in the language beyond\nthe infamous Numa Numa song!\nThis only makes it more difficult explaining that Negura Bunget is an\nextreme metal band from, wait for\nit, the dark and mysterious mountains of Transylvania! To be honest\nthough, there isn\u2019t much intrinsically Transylvanian in this band at all,\nand their main influences are quite\nevidently from the well established\nmetal community of Scandinavia.\nThe title OM is a pun on the Romanian word for man and the sacred\neastern symbol, Aum. A similar\ndisparity of message exists on this\nrecord, where much the guitars can\nbe considered pretty stripped-down\nin that gritty and unabashedly true\nblack metal way; but with higher\nproduction values for just about\neverything else. The vocals tending\ntowards growled chanting, a la Nile,\ninterspersed by epic passages with\nclean singing and pseudo-classical\ninstrumentals.\nThe result is a refreshingly cosmopolitan mixture, which is also\nthe hitch to an extent as the resulting mixture can sound a little bit\ndisjointed in places. Fortunately,\nNegura\u2019s aspirations have more or\nless paid off with this album, which\nsees the band moving towards the\nkind of avant-garde metal postulated by bands like Enslaved. Thus\nI feel that this is a very promising\neffort overall, though one with an\nunquestionably been there, done\nthat feel to it.\nAlex McKitrick\nJust Jack\nStarz In Their Eyes\n(Universal)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nsingle review\nEvery now and then, there shines a\nlittle glimmer of hope in the world\nof music and individuality reintro-duces itself and pokes us in the\nears. Why is this song this great?\nWell, because honestly, you cannot\ncompare it to any other song. The\ndifficultly now-a-days in producing\ntotally new sounds can be seen by\nhow many re-releases, own renditions and no-effort songs are continually released. So on rare occasions when a song such as this is\nproduced, it\u2019s only appropriate to\nget a bit excited, right?\nJust Jack comprises of NorthLondoner Jack (obviously) Allsopp\n(you might have not known his sur-name) and his genre of music is a\nbit of pop, a bit of house, and a pinch\nof hip-hop with garage roots. Starz\nIn Their Eyes is his second release\nwith a strong up-beat composed of\ndrums and what I\u2019m guessing to be\nthe banjo. The song comprises of a\ngood bassline and is a dance-along\ntune. Not only does Just Jack unite\nhis diverse music tastes in this song\nbut also provides lyrically genius by\ndescribing \u2013 poetically \u2013 the lives of\nordinary people changing into celebrities to find out the \u2018dream\u2019 life\nis not as pleasant as they always\nthought.\nWatch out for his eagerly anticipated LP\n, Overtones, his music will\nbe a great part of the new sounds\nof 2007.\nAfet Mehmet\nMika\nGrace Kelly\n(Island)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nsingle review\nThis song I describe as the \u2018happy,\nhappy, happy song\u2019, just due to the\nhigh notes singer, Mika Penniman,\nreaches in it and the rainbows he is\nlyrically painting. There is a cheerful piano melody with a sort-of\nmarching beat and the song can be\ndescribed as power-pop.\nThe first time I was introduced\nto Mika\u2019s music was at a gig recently and he was definitely the\nliveliest act there easily. He was\nintroduced as being vocally comparable to Freddie Mercury but what\nI think they missed out is a vocal\ntint of Justin Hawkins (The Darkness) and the musical style of Jake\nShears (Scissor Sisters), because\nI can really hear the similarities\nbetween their music. I had to dock\none star because the debut single,\nRelax, Take It Easy was just that\nlittle bit better.\nMika was also on Jools Holland\u2019s\nannual New Year show, Jools Holland\u2019s Hootenanny and was tipped\nto be the hottest thing for 2007. The\npredictions on that show seem always to be right, so start saving for\nthe album, Life In A Cartoon Motion which will be released soon. I\nguess you can say Mika Penni-man,\nhe will be no more as he is set for a\nsuccessful year.\nAfet Mehmet\n2pac feat. Ashanti and T.I.\nPac\u2019s Life\n(Interscope)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nsingle review\nAnother track from \u2018Pac. Will this\n\u2018icon\u2019 ever rest in peace? Every\ntime he releases a new single I\nassume his death is just a publicity stunt. Between Biggie and \u2018Pac\nI do not know who is worse. Well\ndo you really want to know about\n\u2018Pac\u2019s Life? No, I am more interested in how I am going to survive\none more year in IC thank you very\nmuch. This track doesn\u2019t really tell\nus more than we already know nei-ther; is it going to make me rush to\nthe cash machine and withdraw my\n\u00a35 to purchase his overpriced single at HMV? Yes, I am a hater, I am\nliving and I ain\u2019t making no paper.\nI am still that poor, broke student\nwaiting for that fabulous IB job.\nPac\u2019s Life is a zingy but chilled\nclub track. Certainly a club topper,\nbut with poor lyrics; no one cares\nanymore about Pac\u2019s trials and the\ntribulations of his hip-hop stardom\ninstead they should have scrapped\nall the Pac bits and left T.I. on the\nwhole track, now that\u2019s what I\u2019m\ntalking about; \u2018THE KING\u2019 left his\nsignature on Pac\u2019s Life. Ashanti\nadds a soulful pitch to the track so\nwe can say a big thank you to her\nfor salvaging the song. It\u2019s a nice\nsingle but nothing exciting.\nFolake Adegbohun\nLady Sovereign\nLove Me or Hate Me\n(Def Jam)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nsingle review\nAh! Would we say refreshing? Maybe! Newly signed Def Jam-newbie Lady Sovereign also known as\nLady \u2018SOV\u2019 drops her crazy grimy\nLondon accent on some mad beats.\nThis track would definitely get you\non the dance floor, it begins with\na very techno super Mario theme\nbeat that just gets you crazy and\nher voice is truly unique and I have\nnot began to explain the remix featuring Missy Elliot. The remix definitely lives up the myth that remixes are way better than the original.\nMissy drops some fantastic vocals\nin her usual style most of it doesn\u2019t\nmake sense but then we all love a\nMissy Elliot production. Although\nthis single is definitely jamming,\nLady Sov is certainly of an acquired\ntaste especially if you like different.\nFolake Adegbohun\n16 Friday 26 January 2007\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

    "content": "We may only be \ufb01ve months into this academic year\nbut already attention is being turned to who will\nlead the Union next year.\nNominations for Imperial College Union\u02bcs Sabbatical\nO\ufb03cer elections will open on January 30th. But why\nshould you be interested in running for one of these\npositions?\nStudents stand for Sabbatical O\ufb03cer for a variety\nof reasons; most want to give something back to\nthe Union that has served them so well during their\ntime here as a student, others want to achieve\npositive change in their Union and help it serve its\nmembers better, and some want the experience of\nmanaging an organisation. There are, of course, CV\npoints at stake and there is no doubt that taking\non so much responsibility at such a young age is a\ngreat experience.\nElections for \ufb01ve Sabbatical Roles (President, most\nof the Deputy Presidents and the Felix Editor)\nwill take place this term. Elections for the Deputy\nPresident (Graduate Students) role will take place in\nthe summer term.\nWhat are these roles like? Well, I can really only speak\nfor mine (President) and in good time I am sure the\nother Sabbatical O\ufb03cers will provide you with their\ninsights. For the time being, I have produced the\nfollowing summary:\nThe Felix Editor is responsible for ensuring that\nwe all get an entertaining and informative edition\nof Felix on a weekly basis during term time. As\nanybody who has ever worked for a newspaper will\ntell you, this is no mean feat! That said the rewards\nare generous, and many past Felix Editors have\nfound their way into the murky world of media and\ndone extremely well for themselves.\nThe Deputy President (Clubs and Societies) is the\ndefactochiefofall300ImperialCollegeUnion\u02bcsclubs\nand societies. This is a bit like herding 300 Siamese\ncats and can be frustrating at times. Aside from\nday-to-day management, he or she is responsible\nfor designing and implementing club policy and\ndelivering projects, such as recent improvements to\nthe website, that make life a lot easier for club chairs\nand club members. This is a real \u201cgrass roots\u201d role\nthat involves a lot of interaction with club chairs\nand members.\nThe Deputy President (Education and Welfare) is\nresponsible for co-ordinating internal and external\nrepresentation by managing all of Imperial College\nUnion\u02bcs academic and welfare representatives. He\nor she is responsible for developing internal and\nexternal relations and co-ordinating academic\nand welfare campaigns. There is also a casework\nelement to this role and it is important that caring\nand sympathetic people are elected to this post.\nNext year the holder of this o\ufb03ce can expect to play\na high pro\ufb01le role in the NUS, which promises to be\nan exciting and entertaining project.\nThe Deputy President (Finance and Services) is\nresponsible for overseeing the business aspects\nof the Union, namely our bars, shops and catering\noutlets. He or she is also responsible for all \ufb01nances\nof the Union and can expect to approve hundreds\nof events and tour budgets throughout the year.\nIn theory the holder of this position is responsible\nfor a turnout in excess of \u00a35.5 million pounds. If\nICU is lucky and wins approval from the College to\nmove forward with the next phase of the building\nmasterplan, then this turnout can expect to rise\nto nearer \u00a39 million pounds. Anybody interested\nin a career in \ufb01nance or business should seriously\nconsider applying for what is clearly one of the best\ngraduate \ufb01nance jobs in the market.\nThe President is ultimately\nresponsible for everything\nlisted above, and more.\nIn particular, he or she is\nresponsible for sta\ufb03ng,\ngovernance and high level\nrepresentation. This job is\nnot for the faint hearted and\nconsiderable leadership\nexperience and a resilient\nego are highly desirable.\nThe holder of this o\ufb03ce can\nexpect to go head-to-head against the Rector, the\ngovernment and, unavoidably, other senior Union\no\ufb03cers. The President gets blamed for everything\nthat goes wrong in the Union and occasionally gets\nblamed for things that happen outside the Union\nand are completely beyond his or her control. There\nare, of course, serious perks to this job and I must\nadmit I enjoy the kick of being in charge of an\norganisation and interacting with interesting and\nin\ufb02uential people. Aside from running the Students\u02bc\nUnion, The President is also a governor of Imperial\nCollege, which in itself is an important and very\ninteresting role. Most people who have held this post\nrarely enter into mainstream graduate jobs and it\nshould be considered one of the best management\nfast-track graduate schemes in town.\nIf you are interested in standing for any of these\nroles then please do not hesitate to contact the\nsabbatical o\ufb03cers.\nunionpage\nElection time again!\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nCentenary Launch Event\nTuesday 30th January, Beit Quadrangle\nThe Imperial College Big Band.\nJuggling and skating teams performing.\nIC Radio broadcasting live!\nRide Bo\u2019 and Jez, our mascot vehicles.\nQueens Tower tours.\nCentenary Balloon Race.\nCentenary Cake will be cut.\nWinter Pimms, Hotpot & Tea served.\nand much more...\nCentenary Balloon Race Competition\nWe will be running a Centenary Balloon Race and\neach of the 500 balloons we plan to release at 1pm\nPrizes include:\nAn all expense paid trip for two to Paris!\nTwo iPod Nanos\n\u00a350 Primark vouchers\nWine and chocolates\nSpecial edition Centenary Mugs\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 26 January 2007\nCOMMENT & OPINION comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCelebrate Britain and Britishness\nW\ne are writing to\npetition for the\nfoundation of a\nnew society in our\nImperial College\nUnion \u2013 the Royal Society of Great\nBritain, aka the BritSoc.\nIt is apparent that the dilution of\nthe British is beginning to cause a\nlack of unity and therefore, to protect our identity we would suggest\nthe need for an entity to coagulate\nus. One may say that the idea of\nhaving a British society is absurd,\nbut every other country seems to\nhave its own society, in which they\nare free to revel in the presence\nof their compatriots. Take the Chinese, they seem to be so tremendously excited at being Chinese,\nand so scared of forgetting their\nmother-land they find it necessary\nto have three societies. Yes, that\u2019s\nthree. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if\nsooner or later, we witness the formation of a Homo-sapien society.\nH-Sap. Soc. \u2013 \u2018Lest we forget\u2019.\nOne may argue that since we\nare not exactly from overseas, we\nshouldn\u2019t qualify for an \u2018overseas\u2019\nsociety. There is, however, great\nneed for an environment in which\nwe can bond with our fellow coun-Valerio Chang\nValerio Chang believes the British deserve their own society to match the other overseas societies\ntrymen, just like the Malaysians\nand Cypriots do. Being humans,\n(just like the Greeks,) we feel more\nat ease and comfortable talking to\npeople from our own culture, who\nshare our values and backgrounds.\nImagine a setting in which Bungle\nand George, Fireman Sam and Super Ted can all be reminisced about\nfreely without having some international go, \u201cwho?!\u201d.\nBeing so thinly spread, we think\nwe should even dare to consider\nexplicitly involving the Welsh, the\nIrish and the Scots, to create an\nenvironment where we can whine\nabout our dwindling numbers in\nover-zealous regional accents in\nattempt to fully exclude those from\nabroad. If it is as popular as we believe it should be, it will become a\ncrucial tool in helping us avoid accidentally learning about other cultures or languages whilst studying\nat Imperial, providing the proverbial \u2018la la la, I\u2019m not listening fingers\nin the ears\u2019 with a touch of class.\nWe will strive to represent the true\nBritish culture within in this age of\nmulticulturalism and help others\nto understand British traditions,\nvalues and accents. We wish to promote awareness of the various aspects of our heritage, Queen\u2019s English, \u2018Imperialism\u2019 (pun intended),\nand our capacity to hold our ale.\nEvents we organize will include\nale drinking, extreme queuing,\nbeer drinking, extended periods of\nnot complaining, lager drinking, all\ncumulating in some good old hoo-liganism; no event would be complete without it. Any non-British\nwill inevitably benefit hugely from a\nbit of exposure to the pub culture,\nbrutish rugby games, fish and chips,\nCornish pastries, cricket, tea and\nscones by the river, Monty Python\nand good old Yorkshire puddings.\nWe do hope you will consider our\npetition with the utmost serious-ness, and look forward to the col-lege-wide realization of the great\ngrandness of Great Britain.\nTally ho!\nTypical people of Britain, laughing in a typically British way\nH\now often do you hear\nthese words: \u201cOnly at\nImperial would anyone get that joke\u201d or\nhas anyone ever been\nwitness to this phrase echoing\naround the union bar: \u201cI\u2019m serious,\nwhere are the women\u201d? Imperial\nCollege is the biggest self-loathing\ngroup of people ever assembled in\none place.\nI like to think of myself as quite\nsocially active in and out of Imperial with, of course, other people at\nthis college and I still can\u2019t seem\nto grasp why we hate ourselves\nso much. In case you\u2019d forgotten,\nhere\u2019s a list of reasons why we ain\u2019t\nno hollaback girls:\n1) We\u2019re the best college in\nLondon.\n2) We\u2019re the richest college in the\nU.K (mm, facilities)\n3) We have in our possession at\nleast 400 times the debating power\nof any other university on issues\nregarding the Muslim integration\ndebate.\n4) We don\u2019t have any of those \u201cart\u201d\nstudents; you know, the ones who\nget those really wispy haircuts and\ndrone on about how much better\nJoy Division are than New Order\nor all those electro bands that copy\nthem but actually listen to Steps\nand they seem to think that being\nhygienic is a constriction of their\nhuman rights: \u201cI\u2019m too much of a\nfree spirit to clean this fork, now\npass the bong; I have a higher plane\nto reach.\u201d\nAll that points to the good, right?\nWrong. So stupidly, annoyingly,\nspoon to the eye wrong. For some\nreason, we see ourselves as big fat\nWe\u2019re not antisocial, honest guv\nNicholas English takes a look at what\u2019s wrong with us at Imperial, and what we do well (hint: it\u2019s not nothing)\npussy assed, spot infested, computer game obsessed geeks (or g33ks\ndepending on your world of choice:\nchoices include real and WoW). Far\ntoo often do I see people in conversation just laughing at how inept\nImperial is at events or moaning at\nhow expensive the formal dinners\nare and how no-one goes to them\nanyway it\u2019s just a bunch of lecturers\ngetting shitted on wine that tastes\nlike it\u2019s been secreted by an otter\u2019s\npancreas. These things may be\ntrue, but why dwell on them when\nthere is a wealth of things to do in\nLondon. I know this sounds clich\u00e9\nbut it\u2019s true, it\u2019s the fucking biggest\ncity in fucking Europe.\nA point many people seem to persist upon is the lack of dynamism\noffered by the Union in relation to\nevents. In defence of this point of\nview, John Collins seems to have\nrather special ideas about what we\nrequire from him, by telling us the\nunion is not just about organising\nevents.\nI\u2019d be very surprised if more than\n10% of students actually cared\nabout politics and the NUS (ok,\nloads voted but only because you\ne-harassed us into it, which I will\nnever forgive you for), but let\u2019s\nbe honest, a massive percentile\nof students want to get pissed 2, 3\ntimes a week and spend the rest\nconcentrating on balancing work\nand the rest of their life. Student\npolitics figures low low low down in\nthe list of priorities; if you asked all\nthe students whether they thought\ntheir welfare was in good health at\nimperial college they\u2019d all chuckle\nand say \u201cCourse mate, cheers for\nasking\u201d once you\u2019re ten paces away\nthey\u2019d be guffawing at the very idea\nthey had a rough ride at Imperial.\nAlthough the new DaVinci\u2019s layout\nis sexy beyond belief, the union is\nstill guilty of making going out second best, an immediate turn off for\nany student.\nAs you can tell this mass self-dep-recation is a great concern of mine\nand after many hours of ruminating I\u2019ve come to the only sensible\nconclusion: Imperial College is to\nblame. Not any figurehead, or rector or DPFS or DPGS or MFI or\nB&Q but Imperial College as an\ninstitution; how many of you remember at some point during your\nopen-day, visit or being in contact\nwith any imperialite prior to arriving at this institution, being told the\nfollowing facts: \u201cAh man, like you\u2019ll\nget a wicked degree and stuff but\nlike it\u2019s 80-20 percent guys to girls\u201d\nor the classic: \u201cIt\u2019s good here yeah\nbut like there\u2019s only 3 English students on my course\u201d or the one I\nwas lucky enough to hear \u201cThis is\nthe JCR, never go there\u201d. I know\nwhat you\u2019re thinking \u201cTss don\u2019t be\ndaft, the fella was having a laugh\u201d\nwell exactly and so are we when we\njoke about the fact there\u2019s no sandwiches left after 5 or something of a\nsimilar ilk.\nIt\u2019s not just the reputation gained\nbyImperial.Thelayoutissomething\nto behold. It has so many uncomfortable social spots that it makes\nyou want to just sprint around college to avoid awkwardness. I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ve strolled down the Sherfield Walkway, spotted a dear chum\nfrom afar and he\u2019s spotted you, you\nknow what\u2019s coming but it\u2019s too far\naway to start a conversation, too\nnear to avoid and just down right\nannoying. The same came be said\nof every department, they all have\nthese absurdly long corridors with\nwalls that watch you as you walk\nand close in as you get nearer the\npal in question so that you\u2019re both\nstuck in some sort of fake conversation that doesn\u2019t start or finish\nwithin these confines.\nBut never fear, these are some\ntried and tested pointers on how\nto avoid any sort of cringe worthy\nmoment:\n1) The army salute: performed,\nwith wink and click of tongue, with\nthe intention of being as cheesy as\npossible from the offset so that it\ncan\u2019t get any worse.\n2) The bendy knees and double\ngun shooting with win and click of\ntongue, preceded by \u201ceyyyyyy\u201d a la\nFonz: hard to imagine but we\u2019ve all\nseen it and fake laughed.\n3) The denial: both glance up\nseveral times and only say \u201calright\nmate\u201d at the very last second.\n4) Chanting of the name from at\nleast 50m away: crude but extremely effective, let\u2019s other people know\nthat you\u2019re happy to see this person\nand that he\u2019s obviously cool since\nhe has a chant for his name.\n5) Casual conversation: worst pos-sible, people can\u2019t have 10 second\nconversations, it\u2019s just unethical.\n6) My personal favourite: Run up\ninto their face at full tilt, body checking them, fake punching or just\nscreaming \u201cAAHAHAHAAAAHHHGGGHHH\u201d right in their mug.\nI hope this goes to show that we\nneed not mock ourselves for maybe\nnot being the most party-going college of all time but possess other\nqualities. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside that\ncounts, other unis just have beer in\nthem.\n\u201cAny non-British\nwill inevitably\nbenefit hugely\nfrom a bit of\nexposure to the\npub culture\u201d\nAt Imperial, we get them started young. Derive, you little bastard\n\n"

Nevertheless \u2013 and I\u2019m\nsure most of you are well aware\nby now \u2013 one plucky World of\nWarcraft gamer arranged with\ntheir guild a 28-hour run through\nAzeroth that would lead to them\nbeing the first Level 70 player in\nthe acclaimed MMORPG.\nWhich, it has to be said, makes\nthis week\u2019s five-hour shoot\nthrough Hitman: Blood Money\nseem less like an epic journey of\nkilling, and more like a half-hour\nsaunter on Sunday afternoon. See\nwhat you think of our attempts to\nfashion ourselves as serial killers\nover the page.\nThe twenty-eight hour marathon through the best-loved\nonline world, though, is an impressive feat, especially given\nBlizzard\u2019s hopes that the latest\nexpansion pack, Burning Crusade, would last gamers for another six months or so. It\u2019s an immense effort of co-operation and\ntiming that allowed the members\nof their Guild to protect, support\nand aid the now-famous player to\nthe new level cap.\nI doubt it means that we\u2019re\nbreeding some strain of super-hu-man who will be able to solve all\nof mankind\u2019s future ills through\nscaled planning, time management and an Archivist Cape of\nthe Whale.

    "content": "Wielding the\nalmighty organ\nI\nhave finally decided to print something on the\nrestructuring of the Union bars. Originally,\nthe vast majority of what is referenced occured during the summer period, as we sabbs\nwere just being trained / indoctrinated / getting drunk every evening. I\u2019ve held off writing\nsomething for a while until it became apparent\nthat the changes that have been made have affected students (a number of people have approached\nme about it - thanks to those that eventually convinced\nme), and that they didn\u2019t understand what had happened and why. Hopefully, the news piece on page 2, and\nthe comment piece on the left hand page should tell you\nexactly what happened in a (reasonably) fair and balanced way.\nAnd now for something completely different. Elections\nare approaching. I know that this typically elicts a sigh\nof despair from your common-or-garden student, as god\nknows you hate being harrassed in your lunch hour by\na bunch of over-keen and under-washed student politi-cians. BUT WAIT!\nIf you whinge about the way the Union is run, and you\ndidn\u2019t vote, then tough. If you don\u2019t like the current gaggle of sabbs, and you didn\u2019t vote, then tough. If you think\nyou can do better, then you should damn well stand. The\njob of a sabb is pretty thankless for the majority of the\ntime; no-one ever notices when you\u2019re doing a good job,\nbut they will wreck you up if you\u2019re doing a bad job. It is\nthe only way you can make a difference in the way things\nare run round this corner of town.\nMy third point is about Felix. If you don\u2019t like what\nyou\u2019ve seen here over the last term and two weeks,\nthen you need to tell me. I\u2019m not psychic. We\u2019ve made\na few changes this term, based on the comments we\u2019ve\nheard around campus. It seems you like the horoscopes\nand the extra sudoku, and that the centrefolds are nice\nto have back but a bit... off. I\u2019m saying no more on that\nsubject.\nI\u2019ve got fill this space now, and I\u2019ve got surprisingly little to say for a change. I could do what I normally do,\nand use these last few lines to relate some horribly tragic lovelife story, thereby purging myself of all residual\nemoness, or I could moan about how I\u2019m getting old\nand can\u2019t understand the music the kids like, or I could\nwhinge about how my hearing is going and everything is\nmore expensive than it used to be.\nI can\u2019t do the lovelife story, as a dear, dear friend of\nmine told me a far better one involving a young lady who\nhappened to be into members of her own sex, yet he fell\nhorrifically in love with her. It\u2019s so fantastic you can\u2019t\nmake it up, and it made anything I could say look like a\nbig fat load of teenage whining.\nThat\u2019s it.

Since it is\nan integral part of ICU employment\ncontracts, it is nothing short of legal\ncensorship.\nI believe that the continued badgering\nof the student press towards individual\nstaff members is wrong and shouldn\u2019t\nhappen. Staff are not voted for by the\nstudent body and should not directly\nbe accountable to them. However, SSP\nhas taken the rather worrying step of\nbanning all discussion relating to ICU\npolicy (by staff) and ICU staff (by stu-dents). If a staff member has acted inappropriately or been made redundant\nthen these facts should be available to\nthe wider student body through media\noutlets such as Live! and Felix.\nNaturally, decisions to hire and fire\nstaff should not be influenced by the\nstudent press. SSP can still work to\nensure this. However, preventing facts\nfrom being published and discussions\nto be started is an insult to democratic\nvalues.\nUltimately the Union is run for the\nbenefits of the student body and no\none else. If a part of the Union is losing money then that means less money/\nservices available for students. This\nshould not be hidden away from pub-lication. I believe these facts should\nbe allowed to be printed. Ents and the\nUnion Shop lost an awful lot of money\nlast year. Under SSP discussion of why\nthis should be the case (for example individual acts booked by the Ents man-ager, losses from writing off stock in the\nUnion Shop) is not allowed.\nSSP can still protect the \u201cdemocratic\npractise\u201d of the Union by preventing\nstaff actively interfering in Union poli-cy, but it should not censor or ban staff\nfrom making comments on the way the\nUnion is run. Staff comments can be\na valuable asset to a body such as the\nUnion.\nIn most cases staff have a great deal\nof knowledge that would be invaluable\nas suggestion. Of course if an elected\nstudent wishes not to take that advice\nthen that is his/ her right to do so. However, the right of staff to voice opinion\nshould be exist and so should the right\nto publish that opinion.\nAccording to the Editor of Live! it\nis all right to say what you like about\nmembers of staff who no longer work\nfor the Union. However, the employment contract of current Union staff\nprotects them from criticism by the student press. This means that if I were to\nmake comment about one of the permanent members of Union staff it would be\ncensored.\nI have every faith that the new managers and new bar staff will get better\nin time and that things will be the same\nif not better than they were. But until\nthat time I believe that discussions and\ncomment should be allowed to take\nplace.\nThe Union may not respect the views\nof students and staff in this context, but\nthey should respect their right to voice\ntheir opinions.\n\u201cI know why there\u2019s no noise\u2026 I know\nbut I can\u2019t tell you\u201d said Jade to Shilpa\nas she left the Big Brother House. Enveloped by an eerie silence due to the\nunusual absence of any live audience,\nthis rare exit has come about following fears for Jade\u2019s safety after the\nmost controversial week in the show\u2019s\nhistory.\nLets not forget that this is the same\nperson who has in the past frequently\ncome out with gaffes such as \u201cthey\nwere trying to use me as an escape\ngoat\u201d or \u201cRio de Janeiro, ain\u2019t that a\nperson?\u201d Now this is not about taking\na highbrowed, stiff upper lip swipe at\nthe eloquence of chavs or their lack of\nclass and education. These are things\nlargely out of their control and a fault of\nthe unequal opportunities offered by the\nsystem. But the very first quote is either\na surprisingly deep foresight from Jade\nor more likely, the unwanted product\nof coaching that escaped her lips during the live broadcast. Similarly, coolly\ndeclaring that \u201cI don\u2019t see people for\nthe colour that they are, or where they\ncome from. I don\u2019t want to make a penny from this. I don\u2019t want money from\nsomething that is wrong\u201d seems to be a\nsuspiciously PC and coherent response\nfrom someone who once expressed that\nshe \u201clooked like a state\u201d.\nHonestly looking at it, I do not think\nJade was being overtly racist. I think\nshe was out to intimidate someone who\nshe felt was better than her on all levels;\nsomeone who was vulnerable and easy\nto single out; someone who threatened\nher ego and her sense of celebrity. This\ncaused her to act as the alpha bully\nagainst Shilpa, against the backdrop of\ntwo nefarious accomplices. It is something that as kids we have all seen on\nplaygrounds. Besides, Shilpa was there\nout of choice, as Bollywood filmmaker\nMahesh Bhatt said in a Mumbai news-paper: \u201cI believe no-one can insult you\nwithout your permission. Shetty has\npaid the price for trying to desperately\nseek the approval of the West. It is pathetic how we can go on bended knees\nand lick their boots in an effort to be\npart of their world\u201d.\nRegardless, the point is not whether\nJade was being racist or not. What has\nbeen shown on Big Brother has been\nunacceptable, full stop. Channel 4 and\nEndemol have been trying to excuse\nthemselves with justifications ranging from \u2018its just bullying\u2019 to \u2018we are\nprovoking debate\u2019, but the truth of the\nmatter has been succinctly put by an\nanonymous but successful TV producer in the following quote: \u201cthey must be\nunable to believe their luck. The Prime\nMinister, the Chancellor and the Leader of the Opposition all in one day. You\ncan\u2019t buy that publicity\u201d. Knowing fully\nthat they would be able to get away with\nit, they have been making profiteering\nentertainment out of the worst mental\ntorment and possibly discrimination\nthat Britain has to offer, conveniently\ntrying to patch things up in the end by\nblatantly coaching the contestants on\nwhat to say to calm things down.\nNo regard was given to the well being of ether Shilpa or Jade, who has\nnow truly been made the \u2018escape goat\u2019,\nwhen instead it should have been Channel 4 and Endemol. Jade is now at the\nrisk of developing mental health prob-lems, and her children fear \u201crejection\u201d,\nbut Channel 4 has finally seen a healthy\nincrease in profits. The image of British society and culture abroad has been\nsignificantly damaged with a threat to\nour inward investment, but Endemol\nmay finally have convinced its parent\ncompany Telefonica not to sell its controlling stake. Moreover, the attention\nthis has drawn in India will probably allow Endemol to export Big Brother to a\nhuge emerging market and Channel 4\nto make massive profits from the spin-offs, advertising and 24 hour channels.\nUltimately though, the major chunk\nof the blame lies with us, the audience.\nWe have been the ones who have made\nthis celebration of stupidity and arrogance the success it is. Television like\nthis has been a huge success in insulating the masses and we have been the\nones switching on and boosting ratings\nfor this sorry episode. I mean there is a\nreason why Jade\u2019s perfume was a best\nseller and that she became a millionaire through her \u2018career\u2019 of TV shows,\nmagazine deals, an autobiography, and\nremarkably, fitness DVDs! I myself\nam sorry to have given Big Brother\neven the limited publicity I have done\nthrough this piece. Please people, just\nswitch it off. Enough is enough.\nBig Brother piggy pig\nAmmar Waraich rakes Jade Goody and Channel 4 over hot coals\nJade Goody: \u201cAm I minging?\u201d Yes. Yes you are.

    "content": "Brittania will rule, OK?\nOscar nominations are out and rumours abound, but the results are anyone\u2019s guess\nThis last year has been a fairly\ngood one for film, not stellar, but\nquite good. We\u2019ve seen some life\nbreathed back into the Bond series,\nand an abundance of good fantasy\nand drama such as Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, Tideland, and Babel.\nThe awards ceremonies have so\nfar reflected this, and have already\nrewarded some genuinely good\nfilms. However, we still have the\nmain event still to come.\nThe Oscars: a time where the entire film industry decides what reflects their best efforts of the past\nyear. The Oscars are always a reminder of everything that is both\nhated and loved about the great\nHollywood dream.\nThis year is no different. A quick\nglance at the nominations list to\nyour right, and you will see samey\nand predictable choices nestling\nbeside some interesting selections.\nThis year sees the grand institution of British drama given several\nnominations, with Helen Mirren,\nFilm Editor\nThe Fountain: Unhealthy obsessions with eternal life\nFLIM\nIt\u2019s time for the annual trip to Oscarsville.Whilepoliticsandpopular-ity competitions sometimes render\nthe awards defunct, this year there\nare some genuinely good actors up\nfor accolades this year.\nSadly we have no prizes for you\nthis week, but feel free to guess the\ncharacter/film combination anyway.\nYou may well win my respect.\nShe prods buttock in a furry helmet\nSome films seem destined never to\nbe completed. Famously, a whole\nfilm came from Terry Gilliam\u2019s inability to complete The Man Who\nKilled Don Quixote, but most are\nsimply never heard of again. A few\nyears back, a project that seemed\nto be headed that way was The Last\nMan, an epic with a suitably epic\nbudget helmed by Darren Aronofsky, director of Pi and Requiem for\na Dream, both of which were suitably fresh in the studio\u2019s minds to\nimpress them into shelling out a\ngreat deal on his epoch-spanning\nwork about eternal life.\nHowever, then things started to\nfall apart - the lead actor left due\nto creative differences, the studio\npulled out and there was talk of Aronofsky adapting Batman, Watchmen and Cat\u2019s Cradle. Years later,\nhowever, he managed to complete\na scaled-back version, titled: \u2018The\nFountain\u2019, for less than half the\noriginal cost of the aborted version.\nUnfortunately, it really does\nshow; with the exception of one\nlocation, every scene is noticeably\nstudio-based. It becomes difficult\nto suspend disbelief when it\u2019s clear\nthat everything has been shot in\nthe same building, be it a labora-tory, a Mayan temple, a bubble\nfloating through space, a jungle, or\na curiously one-sided street. It feels\nmore like a television drama than a\nproper film, as such. Only twice do\nwe even see brief fragments of journeys between one place and anoth-er, lending the work a fragmented,\ndisjointed feel.\nIt doesn\u2019t help matters that the\nstory consists of three narratives\nin the past, present and future, Hugh Jackman: Conquistador, doctor, and futurstic bubble-naut\nostensibly about the same charac-ters, flitting from one to another\nand leaving gaps in each story. The\nfuture segment, particularly, omits\nmore than it contains - at no point is\nit clear how this man got where he\nis, who he is and how he knows to do\nwhat he is doing. Of all the aspects\nof the film, this is the most irksome,\nsince the other two narratives hold\ntogether very well, and the links between all three are sound.\nThese stories themselves, underneath the stylistic trappings,\nconcern themselves with the quest\nfor eternal life, in some form or an-other; a conquistador searching for\nthe tree of life in Central America,\na doctor searching for a cure for\nhis wife\u2019s cancer, and a chap travelling in a bubble toward a dying star\nwhich will grant him and his tree\neternal life together. Or something.\nProfound and beautiful as it all undoubtedly is, there is very little in\nthe way of explanation for the future segment; since the lead character in each era is played by Hugh\nJackman - played very well, I might\nadd - it is unclear as to whether he\nis meant to be the same character\nas in the present, or whether he is\njust another reincarnation of the\nconquistador. It\u2019s hard to shake the\nfeeling that we aren\u2019t being told the\nwhole story, and since the screenplay was rewritten to accommodate\na massive cut in budget it\u2019s a fair\nbet that we really aren\u2019t.\nThough if you can cope with the\nconfusing storyline (which is hardly\nany more complex than the average Lynch offering) and lamentable\nlack of funding, it really is a spectacular work - the special effects\nwere realised by filming chemical\nreactions on petri dishes rather\nthan through CGI, in a very successful attempt to lend it a timeless\nand organic air. The result is nothing less than magnificent, and the\ndenouement is visually breathtak-ing. The music, too, is impeccable\n- Aronofsky\u2019s long-time collabora-tor, Clint Mansell again provides\nthe score, performed by the Kronos\nQuartet (who worked on Requiem\nfor a Dream, also) and Mogwai\n(who didn\u2019t), without the electronic\nedge he brought to Pi and Requiem,\nsimilarly striving to be timeless and\norganic in feel. As such, both the\nmusic and the cinematography are\nultimately successful in their goals,\nand very satisfying to boot.\nIt\u2019s just the stuff holding them together that doesn\u2019t quite work.\nHugh Mansfield\nEver-Present Whinger\nThe Fountain\nDirector: Darren Aronofsky\nWriter: Darren Aronofsvky,\nAri Handel\nCast: Hugh Jackman,\nRachel Weisz\nForest Whitaker appears to be a\ndead cert for Best Actor this year,\nalthough this could be upset by\nHelen Mirren\u2019s similar type of role\nJudi Dench, and Kate Winslet contending for the Best Actress catego-ry, along with the venerated Meryl\nStreep. Helen Mirren is clearly the\nfavourite, especially after her Golden Globes sweep. Peter O\u2019Toole\nalso receives a nomination for Best\nActor, possibly as a reaction to the\nlifetime achievement award that he\nwas given a few years ago to which\nhe responded: \u201cBut I\u2019m still a working actor...\u201d\nBabel, Dreamgirls, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, and The Queen are all up\nfor multiple nominations, some\nof which are well-earned, and the\nlegend that has become An Inconvenient Truth is almost certainly\npoised for recognition.\nThe Best Director category is\nprobably the least predicatable\ncategory this year, with Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Stephen\nFrears and Martin Scorsese\nneck-and-neck.\nFollowing the trend for biographi-cally realistic portrayals in recent\nyears, after Phillip Seymour Hoffman won Best Actor for Capote,\nin Best Actress. This year appears\ntorn in several directions. As al-ways, this is all just guesswork, and\nuncertainty reigns supreme.\nHot Tip: Forest Whitaker for Best Actor in The Last King Of Scotland\n12 felix Friday 26 January 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "What happened to the Union bars?\nOver the summer, a \u201crestructuring\u201d of the bar took place which went largely unnoticed by the majority of\nthe student population. Now, after it\u2019s all over, Jess Baker and Mez Pahlan reveal exactly what happened\nT\nhe more observant\namongst you may have\nnoticed that changes\nhave been brewing\naround the Union bars.\nWhen you came back from your\nlong, lazy summer holidays, there\nwas a big asbestos-filled hole instead of a central foyer, and da\nVinci\u2019s had turned a lovely clinical\nshade of green. But not all of the\nchanges that have been happening\nhave been so visibly noticeable.\nThe bars and catering at the\nUnion went through a complete\nrestructuring last term. This was\nplanned out during the summer\nand put into action at the end of\nAugust. At this time, the bars and\ncatering staff were invited to a\nmeeting with the Permanent Secretary and the Commercial Services\nmanager to discuss the new EPOS\nsystem and explain that there may\nbe some staff restructuring but\nthat there was nothing to worry\nabout. Student staff present at the\nmeeting expressed concern over\nwhether their jobs would be changing as a result of the restructuring\nand were assured that there would\nbe no changes to the role of student\nstaff (this was later found to be untrue after the abolishment of the bar\nstewards role). The meeting was\nheld during the summer months so\nmost of the staff were at home or on\nholiday. I can\u2019t remember a single\nstudent staff at that meeting who\nstill works for the Union today out\nof shear disgust at being used and\nlied to.\nThe word \u2018consultation\u2019 sends a\nchill down the spine of anyone who\nknows much about employment\nlaw. What \u2018consultation\u2019 generally means is that people are being\nmade redundant. It of course came\nout within a matter of hours that\nthe bar managers were facing re-dundancy. The fact that they hadn\u2019t\nbeen informed that their staff were\nbeing called in for a meeting was\neven more of an insult. The looks\non their faces when we came back\nand said, \u201care you being made redundant?!\u201d was heartbreaking. The\nCatering Manager, John Ivory, also\nmade it very clear to us later on\nthat week that he was facing redundancy as well.\nIt never really became clear to any\none of us, though, why the changes\nwere happening. In the executive\ncommittee meeting of 21 September 2006, financial figures were\nsubmitted for the 2005-2006 year. To\nmake things simple for you so that\nyou don\u2019t have to wade through accounting rubbish, the figures show\nthat:\n\u2022 \u201cRefectory\u201d (bars and cater-ing) made a \u201cnet surplus\u201d of nearly\n\u00a3120,000.\n\u2022 The shop, on the other hand,\nLOST nearly \u00a38000\n\u2022 Ents made a LOSS of over\n\u00a327,000.\nThe figures speak for themselves.\nThe Shop and Ents were haemorrhaging money, whilst the bars and\ncatering were making up the dif-ference. So why were the management systems in these areas being\nchanged?\nI took it upon myself to try and\nspeak to the management of the Union about what was going on, what\nwere the reasons for it happening\nand if it was possible that it could be\navoided. I sat with John Collins, our\npresident, for over an hour talking\nabout the bar; what needed to be\nfixed, what worked, what didn\u2019t and\nfinally why the changes were being\nmade. John told me that there was\nno way back from the proceedings,\nand that student staff jobs were\nbound to change as the new structure involved having more permanent members of staff who would\nbe on shift at the weekends. There\nwould be no need for any more\nsenior staff who worked without a\nmanager on the weekends. These\nshifts earned the bar stewards ex\u201cThe word\n\u2018consultation\u2019\nsends a chill\ndown the spine\nof anyone\nwho knows\nmuch about\nemployment\nlaw. What\n\u2018consultation\u2019\ngenerally means\nis that people\nare being made\nredundant.\u201d\ntra money (due to the extra responsibility they were undertaking) as\nwell as giving them experience in a\nmore managerial role than normal\nbar staff. My experience with him\nwas not a pleasant one since he was\nunwilling to listen to any suggestion\nI had.\nIt transpired, through both the\nconversation with John Collins and\nlater conversations with the bar\nmanagers (Mick Dowling, Rob Dooley and Si Bell) themselves, that the\nbar managers were being offered\nthe chance to apply for the new jobs\nwhich were being created. A new\nposition of Trading Manager would\nbe employed to oversee bars and\ncatering and there would be several\nlesser \u201coperational\u201d managers beneath him. The managers had the\noption of applying for Trading Manager or taking the new equivalents\nof their old jobs. The roles would be\nreduced and so eventually would\ntheir pay. All three of the managers ended up taking the voluntary\nredundancy package. Most of the\nexperienced bar staff, disgusted at\nthe situation, left at this time.\nFor a while after the bar managers left, the bar was still operating\nwith Mick\u2019s name as Designated\nPremises Supervisor and none of\nthe new bar operations managers,\nor the trading manager, were even\nmentioned on the license! The signs\nup at the Christmas carnival still\ncontained the old bar management\nnames. This kind of thing can get\na bar shut down if the local council find out about it and there was\nreally no excuse for the names not\nhaving been changed, as there was\nmore than enough notice to do so.\nSome people have commented\nthat the bar is working better now\nthan ever - I hasten to disagree.\nThe few times I have been back the\nservice has been shoddy and I have\nfound myself instructing staff on\nhow to pour drinks professionally.\nThis is not my job any more \u2013 and\nJess Baker\nMez Pahlan\nThe staff-student\nprotocol\nYou may wonder why the students\nwere not told about what was happening to their bars before in publications such as Felix and Live!.\nThis is due to something called\n\u2013 Staff Student Protocol (SSP)\n(http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/re-source/governance/mou.shtml#g).\nSSP has become part of employment contracts within the Union\nand it serves two main purposes.\nTo prevent permanent members\nof staff (bar managers, catering\nmanagers, finance staff, et al) from\ninterfering with the way the Union\nis run. Conversely it also aims to\nprevent members of ICU (that\u2019s\nyou and me) from discussing permanent members of staff. The idea\nbeing that a scenario whereby, \u201can\nemployee of the Union who was\ncriticised heavily in the student\nmedia and chose to leave could sue\nfor constructive dismissal\u201d (Ashley\nBrown, Live! Editor) is avoided.\nWhilst I agree with this aspect of\nSSP there are two critical points\nthat disgust me so deeply that I\nwish to make them known to a wider audience.\nI only did it because I wanted a decent drink!\nThese people have stated that\nthe queues at the Christmas Carnival being shorter than those at\nthe summer carnival last year is\n\u201cproof\u201d that the new management\nare working better than the old\nones. What you might not know is\nthat under Mick, Rob and Si, last\nyear\u2019s summer carnival last year\nsaw the largest bar take \u2013 ever. You\nremember the one hour queues at\nthe bar? That\u2019s because we were\nabout five staff short that night \u2013\nthey were all on your side of the bar,\ndrinking, or had already gone home\nfor the summer.\nThis Christmas carnival, the\nqueues were a bit shorter (about\nhalf an hour), but that\u2019s because the\nbar was fully staffed. There would\nhave been even shorter queues if\nthere had been any experienced\nstaff on duty, in fact with a full complement of decent staff the queues\ncould have been down to about 10\nminutes.\nSome of the members of student staff who had weathered the\nchange in management at the bar\nwere threatened with being fired\nfor expressing their opinion on a\nnon-college website (Facebook)\nthat they no longer enjoyed their\njobs as much as they used to. A couple of years ago bar staff, catering\nand stewards were changed from\npart-time to casual staff. There\nwould have been a real case for unfair dismissal if bar staff were still\npart-time staff. The Union would\nalmost definitely have lost this case\ncosting the students money (lots of\nmoney since there were quite a few\npeople involved).\n4 felix Friday 26 January 2007\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

    "content": "Annie Mac and Mylo whip up a\nfrantic frenzy at Fabric nightclub\nLaurence Fahrni contributes to the destruction of Rock & Roll with Mylo, Annie-Mac and friends\nMylo, Annie Mac and Guests\nFabric\nFriday 12 January\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nSo it was off to Fabric to write a\nreview on probably London\u2019s most\nwell known club. What could I say\nabout the place that had not already\nbeen said? Fortunately, having never read anything written about Fabric, I present this review blissfully\nunaware of the clich\u00e9s that spew\nfrom my fingers, infecting your delicate mind with stagnant ideas.\nAs ever, the evening began with\nimpeccable timing. It was certainly\na convenience catching my friends\nat the front of the queue, with zero\nguest list waiting time. However,\narriving early enough to avoid them\nqueuing for an era meant I was still\na slave to the fundamental Fabric\nparadox. This is that without the\nhelp of magic beans or a small for-tune, there will likely be always one\ninconvenience. Arrive early enough\nto avoid long queues, and, without\npreparatory sleeping, you run the\nrisk of running out of energy and intoxication before 4AM (unless you\nwant to continue parting ways with\nalmost \u00a34 for each bottle of beer).\nPerhaps this is simply a personal\nproblem to feel defeated if I lose the\nwill to battle the night out until being kicked out of the venue.\nAnyhow a trip to the stairs of sedation is all to common for those\nwho\u2019s blood alcohol level have\nswung one way or another from the\ndesired balance, those without the\nenergy to stand, or those who feel\nlike trying a conversation without\nwondering whether the other person speaks the same language as\nyou.\nGetting to the bar, it was time to\nstart a little crowd analysis, try to\nget a cross section of the 2007 Fabric goer. It was immediately observed an un-chartered \u2018trendy hol-lyoaks type\u2019 had reared its pretty\nhead onto the scene, along with the\ntypes that seemed to me had either\njust missed Hoxton, or were in for a\npleasant surprise upon discovery of\nthe streets of Shoreditch.\nMore so, it seemed a stream of\nnewbies were amalgamating themselves with the masses, making\nme feel like a veteran of the place,\nhaving only been a humble three\ntimes. The toilets echoed tales of\nhow many times people had vomit-ed, and the confusion on how to use\nthe taps confirmed my suspicions\nwhilst giving me a more accurate\nfigure on how many were yet to\nconclude the highs and lows of their\nfurtive first foray into the frantic fu-rore of Fabric.\nOnto the dance floor, despite it\nbeing early, that didn\u2019t mean you\ncouldn\u2019t be stopped every few minutes by somebody with the manners\nto kick over the drink you delicately\nplaced on the floor or barge into\nyour get fonky zone. Though this\ndid make me wish I had the spines\nof a hedgehog, I soon realised I easily had the ability to do the same. L\ndouble reliably played the first of\nthe enjoyable music, as I the crowd\nbounced from person to person.\nThough this situation\nbouncers are oh so friendly (OK,\nthe rest is true.)\nGiving up on Mylo appearing, it\nwas time to go home, feeling the\nmost refreshed I\u2019ve ever felt leaving a nightclub. Little did I know it\nhad been Mylo providing the backing beat to my philosophical jour-ney, seeing as his appearance was\nmainly a DJ set, I left in the most\ndancing mood I\u2019d felt all evening.\nHearing tales of the quality of DJ\n\u201clive up to the\u201d Hype\u2019s set, perhaps\nI felt tempted to return.\nI\u2019ll leave with the advice that if\nyou want to go along to Fabric, I\u2019d\nrecommend doing so when a performer or a group of friends gives\nyou occasion to do so, making event\nworthwhile, whichever way you deal\nwith the paradoxical obstacles.\nLaurence Fahrni\ntime for relaxation, without the\nkind of chatter that guarantees\nloss of voice in the close future. As\nthe thumping bassline gave me a\nsonic massage, I reflected upon the\nreview.\nAlthough Fabric has its incon-veniences, you are guaranteed an\neventful night. The large venue may\nmake it likely you lose your friend\u2019s\nbut the likelihood is you\u2019ll run into\nsomebody else you know \u2013 it\u2019s happened every time I\u2019ve been.\nThe club\u2019s name means it draws\npeople from far and wide, and although this brings about the phenomenon of so many people coming into London for their big night\nout (making it a bit like going out in\nLeicester square, with better mu-sic). The sound systems are second\nto none (as far as I know), and the\nNext was Calvin Harris, which\nsported some well prepared backing music. Meanwhile the singer\ndropped lines in the style of David\nBowie, without the lyrical prowess,\nas he taught the recited the verb to\nbe, in the context \u201cI am in the in-dustry, you are in the industry\u201d. Not\nreally my cup of tea, but I think I\u2019d\nspotted what had drawn the Hoxton\ncrowd. Next, Annie Mac supplied\nsome eclectic tunes, with basslines\njust the right pitch to make you\nconstantly think your phone\u2019s going off.\nBecoming weary and not wanting\nto join the stairs social scene for\ntwo long, I was fortunate enough\nto find a sofa on the balcony above\nthe stage whilst waiting for Mylo\nto come on. This proved one of the\nmost highlights of the evening. A\nMylo, taking a break from his natural habitat of a banging nightclub\n2007: Survival of the hottest\nNew clubnights springing up everywhere, electro on the up,\n\u2018nu-rave\u2019 died on its ass, Trash is dead! So what\u2019s hot or not?\nif it becomes nearly as popular, or\nanother night comes along to steal\nalltheTrashkidsonaMondaynight.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something on a\nTuesday night, and want to make a\nchange from Panic! then you could\ncheck out Love Is All at Proud, it\u2019s\na new weekly charity band and DJ\nnight and should be good fun.\nIt seems that Metro Club on\nOxford Street is going seriously\ndownhill recently, their main target\naudience being unoriginal Indie or\nmetal kiddies who like hearing the\nsame thing over and over and over\nagain. You\u2019re even likely to hear the\nsame Nirvana track 3 times in one\nnight at that place. Oh well, whatever makes money I suppose.\nIf Trance is your thing, then you\nmight want to check out Transcience, again at Proud in Camden\noffering a wonderful mix of psychedelic trance and ultra chill out it\u2019s\nthe best place for any Trance addict\nto spend their Sunday night. Right\nnear Cyberdog too so you can stock\nup on your raver outfits and glo-sticks beforehand!\nFinally, somewhere never to visit\nis those terrible chain clubs (Bar-Rumba, Walkabout etc.) If you\u2019ve\nresorted to that we seriously suggest you go out and buy a Timout\nmagazine and look what is actually\nhappening in this huge city.\nChalk might be one of the contenders for being the next amazing club\nnight, as long as they keep to the format of it being a proper Indie night\nand don\u2019t go down the road of Indie\n\u2018superclubs\u2019 like NME, and speaking of NME they are going down, in\nfact they are at the top of our list of\nhorrendous clubnights never to attend unless you really really need\nto go out on a Friday night .\nThe new replacement for Trash\nseems pretty good too, DURRR\nis basically a club night that\u2019s being run by all the other Trash DJ\u2019s\napart from Erol Alkan, so I can only\nassume it will be basically just like\nTrash used to be. Only time will tell\n19\nfelix\nFriday 26 January 2007\nNIGHTLIFE nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

In 2003, when Blair\nwas selling the Iraq war to parlia-ment, as well as something about\n45 minutes, he also said \u201cthe oil rev-enues, which people falsely claim\nthat we want to seize, should be put\nin a trust fund for the Iraqi people\nadministered through the UN.\u201d\nEarlier this month The Independent reported on a new Iraqi oil law.\n\u201cIraq\u2019s massive oil reserves, the\nthird-largest in the world, are about\nto be thrown open for large-scale exploitation by Western oil companies\nunder a controversial law which is\nexpected to come before the Iraqi\nparliament within days\u2026 It would\ngive big oil companies such as BP\n,\nShell and Exxon 30-year contracts\nto extract Iraqi crude and allow the\nfirst large-scale operation of foreign\noil interests in the country since the\nindustry was nationalised in 1972.\u201d\nKamil Mahdi, an Iraqi academic\nand senior lecturer in Middle East\neconomics at the University of Exeter, is critical of these develop-ments, writing in the Guardian \u201cA\ngovernment that is failing to protect the lives of its citizens must\nnot embark on controversial legislation that ties the hands of future\nIraqi leaders, and which threatens\nto squander the Iraqis\u2019 precious,\nexhaustible resource in an orgy of\nwaste, corruption and theft\u2026 This\nstate of affairs has negative results\nfor all except those who are corrupt\nand unscrupulous, and the voracious foreign oil corporations.\u201d In\nother words, the Iraqi people are\ndemanding sovereignty over their\nmost important economic resource,\nwhich accounts for 95% of the Iraqi\neconomy. Since no WMD were\nfound, we learned that we are in\nfact on a democratising mission in\nIraq. Therefore, wouldn\u2019t it be only\nPolicy of multiculturalism officially ditched\nOne of the many buzzwords associated with New Labour\u2019s \u2018Blairism\u2019\nhas been multiculturalism. But like\nwith many other policy threads,\nmulticulturalism now appears to\nhave gone out of fashion.\nThis hands-off approach has come\nabout for many reasons, but has undoubtedly followed the rightwards\npolitical shift of the current govern-ment. In recent policy speeches,\nTony Blair has swept aside the\nnuances of cultural interaction\nand has adopted a rather more direct approach to Britishness, in\neffect rebuking some for holding\non to certain cultural values. Most\nof these values however pose no\nthreat to civilised society and as\none may expect, have been passed\ndown the generational ladder. As a\nresult, current governmental policy\nhas not only caused significant discomfort amongst immigrant popu-lations, but has also made second\nand subsequent generations feel\nguilty for their beliefs.\nWhilst the task of defining Britishness rumbles on in many conversa-tions, whether in the public house\nor the upper echelons of the Home\nOffice, there are a number of key issues that need clarification.\nFirst on the list is the separation\nof multiculturalism from integra-tion. Integration happened long\nago. It happened for anyone from\na non-British lineage born in the\npolite to actually take into account\nthe clearly expressed wishes of\nthe Iraqi people? That would mean\nfirstly not allowing our corporations\nto lobby the fragile and dysfunctional Iraqi government, no doubt with\nbribes and inducements (see BAE\nSystems in Saudi Arabia), effectively giving themselves control of\n\u201cone of the greatest material prizes\nin world history.\u201d Secondly, it would\nmean withdrawing our troops in the\nleast damaging, yet most immediate manner possible. But this won\u2019t\nhappen. The Iraq Study Group endorses selling off the oil to the multinational companies, saying \u201cThe\nUnited States should encourage\ninvestment in Iraq\u2019s oil sector by\nthe international community and\nby international energy companies\u2026 and assist Iraqi leaders to\nreorganize the national oil industry\nas a commercial enterprise.\u201d And\nof course, Bush\u2019s latest policy is to\nsend in 20,000 more troops to create a surge of violence, and flush\nout (i.e. kill) the \u201cterrorists\u201d.\nThis current course, disregarding\nthe opinions of the majority of people both in Iraq and in the West, and\nviewing all problems through the\ncrosshairs of a bombsight, could\nin the long term bring peace to the\nMiddle East. Graveyards, after all,\nare very peaceful places.\nThe author has created a petition\non the Prime Minister\u2019s website,\nurging him not to allow Western\nCorporations to put pressure on\nthe Iraqi government over this is-sue.

It is assimilation however that\nis the important practical phase\nwhen new arrivals begin to interact and find their niche in society.\nFurthermore, assimilation is an on-Andrew Ireson\nThe sun sets behind ships berthed at the important Al Basra Oil Terminal in the Northern Arabian Gulf\nOmar Hashmi\nPolitics Editor\n3\nfelix\nFriday 26 January 2007\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nelements. Without cooperation and\nunderstanding, the future is bleak.\nIn all societies, there exist renegades who detract and work against\nthe core values. And quite rightly,\nthese people should be dealt with\nappropriately. But it is simply unacceptable when a person is asked to\ngo against their own personal val-ues, values that do not contradict\nthe core societal values.\nSo when a person exhibits Nazi\ntendencies or when they blow\nthemselves up on an underground\ntrain killing innocents, it is not multiculturalism that is at fault. It is not\nthe group from which they hail who\nis at fault, nor is it the immigration\nsystem that is at fault. It is rather\nthat they have failed to abide by the\ncore tenets of society and the line\nbetween personal opinion and societal values has been blurred.\nObliging people to renounce their\npersonal values to make \u2018society\nbetter\u2019 is neither practical nor jus-tifiable. It is in fact a backward\nsuggestion. A society need not be\nhomogeneous to work. Blackmailing the offspring of immigrants by\nreferring or making them feel akin\nto \u2018guests\u2019 or second-class citizens\nwill not work either.\nCulture is simply the flavouring of\nan underlying product. Multiculturalism allows one to taste the different flavours in which that product\nmay be found. One should be encouraged to taste the difference, for\nit may encourage a different view.\ngoing two-way process, where both\npreviously native and newly native\npopulations interact, communicate\nand continually assess their ideas\nand beliefs.\nYet, as a condition of citizenship,\nthose who immigrate are quite\nrightly obliged to accept the rules\nand framework of their host soci-ety. They however, need not agree\nwith all the occurings within that\nsociety, but fundamentally, they do\naccept its core values \u2013 those along\nthe lines of tolerance, freedom of\nspeech, equality, justice and welfare for all. As long as they accept\nthese basics, integration is a completed process.\nThe implementation of these core\nvalues is nevertheless quite subjective and is defined by the people\nthat comprise a community. These\nvalues allow for huge disagreement\nin personal opinions, actions and\neven legislation.\nBut this continual appraisal and\ndebate is an important cornerstone\nof any progressive society, and one\nwhich multiculturalism in fact facil-itates. The concept of multiculturalism is that differences in opinion\nshould be respected, probed and\ndebated. This will in turn allow for\nsociety\u2019s core values to flourish.\nIf the debate is undertaken with\na constructive mindset, it will allow\nthose partaking to gain in knowledge and understanding. Without\nknowledge, there can only be scant\ntolerance. With knowledge, there\ncan be respect. Multiculturalism\ntherefore seeks to build a more\nprosperous, inclusive and progressive society.\nBy distancing itself from multiculturalism and adopting an \u201cenough\nis enough\u201d attitude, the British\ngovernment seems to be bowing to\nthe pressure of those from the far\nright who show little interest in understanding those of any different\npersuasion to themselves.\nYet this approach makes no sense.\nIndividual societies are no longer\nthe truly independent entities of\nyesteryear, with no outside influ-ence, but are composed of global\nTony Blair in a speech last year on \u201cBritish values\u201d\nAhmad Moolla\nT\nhey say it is the end of\nthe American Century.\nNot only have people accepted this, but they are\npreparing for what happens after it. A good country must\nplan for at least 100 years in the\nfuture (take Amsterdam\u2019s flooding\nproblem for instance). So when the\nnext bad boy, China, has a little slip-up like testing a ground-to-satellite\nmissile into outer space, which the\nForeign Ministry Liu Jianchao has\nthe audacity to call a \u201cpeaceful activity\u201d, you have to wonder what on\nearth is going on.\nTimothy Garton Ash, a well respected Professor of European\nStudies at Oxford University, has\npreviously stated that a handful of\nfar-sighted people in Washington\nare beginning to formulate a long-term American strategy of trying\nto create an international environment that would protect common\ninterests even when American hy-perpower has faded, and to encourage rising powers such as India and\nChina to sign up to such an order.\nBut the more concerning question\nis, when China and India do rise,\nhow violent will the earthquake be?\nAnd in the race for dominance, will\nwe see yet another pseudo-slave\ntrade-off of rights with advantages\nfor the prosperous nations?\nStill hoping, still waiting.\n\n"

Having worked off the mince pies and\nChristmas cake during a frenzied\nMonday training session, the girls\nwere well up for some top-class\nhockey action!\nSpirits were high in the changing\nrooms despite a guest appearance\nby Howard in goal, and there was\nmuch discussion about five o\u2019clock\nshadows and wandering bikini\nlines.\nOut on the pitch, the IC ladies hit\nRUMS hard from the first whistle\nand after some nifty passing from\nSpan and Cate in midfield and total\ndomination of the D, Argentina\u2019s\nfinest deflected a cross into the\ngoal. 1-0 to IC. A flurry of goals followed including one each for Pru\nand Lucy \u2013 losing their goal virginity in style \u2013 and one for Moonie.\nWith IC 4-0 up it looked like there\nwas no comeback for RUMs with\nthe defence looking solid and a little\nbored. It was rumoured that there\nwas even time for some flirtation\nbetween a certain defender and a\nmystery man from the Mens 1s who\nwears a lot of green. A lucky RUMS\nbreak put the score to 4-1 but, by\nhalf time, Argentina had struck\nagain and the score was 5-1.\nAfter an inspirational half-time\nchat, IC came out and looked distinctly lethargic. The second half\nwas slow-paced until IC were\nawarded a penalty flick when a\nAdLib by Tevong You\nshort corner was stopped by a foot\non the line. Womble drove it home\nnutmegging the goalie. Cate struck\nagain for IC with an exemplary\nstrike from the top of the D, however the umpire controversially disallowed it despite a torrent of abuse\nfrom the sideline. RUMS fought\nback in the second half and despite\nscoring at the wrong end scored\nanother two. The final score was 7-3 and player of the match went to\nHoward.\nSports results\nWednesday 17th January\nFootball:\nMen\u2019s 4s\nRoyal Vets 1s\nMen\u2019s 5s\nKCL Medical School 2s\nMen\u2019s 7s\nUniversity of the Arts 1s\nHockey:\nMen\u2019s 1st\nImperial Medicals 1s\nMen\u2019s 3s\nSt Barts 2s\nWomen\u2019s 1s\nRoyal Free 1s\nWomen\u2019s 2s\nKCL Medical School 4s\nNetball:\nWomen\u2019s 1s\nRoyal Free 1s\nWomen\u2019s 2s\nSt Barts 3s\nRugby:\nMen\u2019s 1s\nRoyal Free 1s\nMen\u2019s 2s\nRoehampton 1s\nWomen\u2019s 1s\nRoyal Vets 1s\nSaturday 20th January\nFootball:\nMen\u2019s 1s\nUCL 1s\nMen\u2019s 2s\nRoyal Holloway 2s\nMen\u2019s 6s\nKCL 6s\nTennis:\nMen\u2019s 1s\nQueen Mary 1s\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n4\n12\n1\n1\n2\n7\n3\n0\n0\n22\n30\n39\n8\n10\n17\n30\n5\n14\n42\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n8\n2\nThey look like golf sticks but thankfully we haven\u2019t had to print two issues with golf on the back page!\nAfter one too many mince pies over\nthe festive period, returning to the\nFortress to play 70 minutes of gruelling hockey was a daunting task,\nhowever the spirit of ICHC shone\nthrough with what can only be described as a demolition project!\nLadies Hockey\nIC 1sts 7\nRUMS 1sts 3\nHaving not lost to the Medic scum\nfor over 2 years and having already\nbeaten them twice this season one\nmight have thought this match\nwas pointless, even so credit was\ndue to the medics for turning up\nto a match that promised so much\nhumiliation!\nHarvester, back from war wounds\nto his forehead, regained his captaincy from Date Rape and was\ndetermined to see his squadron\nperform as well as the Ladies!

Well, it\u2019s the main\npostgraduate halls at Imperial. Not\nonly are we mainly postgrad, we\nare also \u201coutlying\u201d; meaning we\nneed to use the tube to get to College everyday. At this point you\u2019re\nthinking - right, enough of that, next\npage. But, if you can manage another 3 minutes, I\u2019ll try and explain\nwhy some of us actually like it out\nhere and that Zone 1 isn\u2019t the be all\nand end all of London.\nWe\u2019re not all lazy-arse PhD students here, (sorry, correction,\nyour hard working, downtrodden\ndemonstrators). Its about 3/5 MSc\nstudents with a smattering of latter year undergrads too, to add to\nthe PhDs. Clayponds was not built\nas a hall of residence, but for real\nworking people, so is a mix of modern houses and flats. There are 330\nresidents here, but no more than\nfour share a kitchen, bathroom and\nfront door. We are surrounded on\ntwo sides by a graveyard, and on\na third side a geriatric/rehabilita-tion hospital \u2013 it\u2019s quiet most for\ntime, and the neighbours never\ncomplain about the noise. We\u2019re in\nSouth Ealing, six stops on the Piccadilly line from South Ken, if that\nhelps. Right next door is Gunnersbury Park, not quite as big as Hyde\nPark, but has a stack of facilities, including a pitch and putt golf course,\nboating lake, cricket square, mu-seum, not to mention 20+ football\nand rugby pitches. That means we\nplay our inter-hall football games\non proper pitches, with full-sized\ngoals, painted lines and everything.\nIt seems to help, so far this season,\nP7 W7 GD +28. I can\u2019t complain.\nBeyond sport, the pub local, the\nEaling Park Tavern isn\u2019t a bad start.\nHowever, since Time Out found it\nand got into the habit of gushing\nover it every week, it\u2019s been hard\nto get a seat. Ealing Broadway,\nKew and Richmond are all close,\nall good drinking centres. Watching\nthe river ebb and flow from a water\nfront pub isn\u2019t a bad waste of an af-ternoon. In a few pubs near Kew,\nyour bench can be totally cut off by\nthe high tide; leaving you little more\nto do than have another drink until\nthe towpath dries out. Clubbing\nis a little more specialised in the\nsuburbs, but there is something for\neveryone, the Boulevard and Red\nBack seem popular with the residents\u2026 I say no more. Hall parties\nare always popular, not sure if it\u2019s\nthe free bar or the company, but the\nresults are invariably the same, see\nthe gallery at www.clayponds.org\nfor details. I guess the term-time\nevents here aren\u2019t all that different\nto any other hall, but Clayponds really comes into it\u2019s own in the sum-mer, when most undergrads are off\nrepaying their overdrafts. Volleyball or Croquet on the lawn accompanied by the ubiquitous barbeque\nand Pimm\u2019s almost makes the\nplace seem civilised.\nHalls\nwatch\nPaul Green\nClayponds Warden\nI\nt was Saturday December\n30th 2006 that will go down in\nhistory as a special date for\nall Iraqis. The former leader\nof a country, currently in a\ncivil war, was executed. The Iraqi\ngovernment had wished that Saddam\u2019s death would close a very ugly\nchapter in Iraq\u2019s long history. They\nhoped that ending his life would\nease sectarian violence and decelerate the chaos that has consumed\nIraq for so many years. Instead it\nhas strengthened the hatred between the Iraqis and further divided the Muslim world. His death has\nturned a tyrant into somewhat of a\nmartyr in the eyes of some. I, and so\nmany like me, have been left with\nthe burning question- How?\nThere is little doubt that the tyrant that was Saddam Hussein deserved death. This man had terror-ised, tortured and killed thousands\nof people, including his own. Let\nus start with a brief history. Born\non 28th April 1937 in a village 13km\nfrom Tikirit, Saddam Hussein Abd\nal-Majid al-Tikriti came from a poor\nbackground. He was an average\nperson who never knew his father,\nand apparently was mistreated by\nhis stepfather. He later went on to\nstudy law in Baghdad, but never\ncompleted his studies. Instead he\njoined the nationalist Baath party\nin 1957, which was soon involved in\nthe (US backed) attempted assassination of General Qassim. He then\nfled to Egypt, where it is believed he\ngot his CIA training, and returned\nto Iraq in 1964 and was subsequently imprisoned. The Baath party\nthen successfully assumed control\nof Iraq in 1968 following a coup. To\ncut a long story short, Saddam Hussein quickly and ruthlessly rose to\npower before becoming leader of\nthe country in 1979.\nFollowing his rise to presidency\nSaddam moved to consolidate his\npower by holding a meeting in\nwhich he accused several party\nmembers of treason. These members were then immediately arrested and many executed soon after.\nThe meeting itself was videotaped\nand has been viewed by many Iraqis, and is a chilling reminder of\nSaddam\u2019s bloodthirsty nature.\nJust over a year after he came into\npower he invaded Iran after many\nyears of hostility between the two\ncountries. Iraq was plunged into\nan 8 year war that saw both sides\nlose at least 1 million lives. The war\neventually ended in a stalemate,\nwith both countries in financial difficulties and their infrastructures\ndestroyed. Then on 16th March 1988\nSaddam used chemical weapons on\nhis own people to bomb Halabja,\na Kurdish town north of Baghdad.\nThe attack killed thousands and\nleft many thousands more severely\ndisabled. The war crimes committed by Saddam were mounting high\nalready. Barely 2 years passed before he went on to invade Kuwait\nin order to strengthen his grip on\nthe Arab region. The US (backed\nby the UN council) responded and\nso began the Gulf War. An uprising against Saddam followed, with\nthe US promising their support to\ntry and overthrow the Iraqi leader.\nHowever, the US forces shamefully walked away and the uprising was dealt with by Saddam, who\nruthlessly and meticulously killed\nanyone involved and very quickly\ncrushed any resistance. The UN\nthen imposed sanctions on Iraq\nthat would cripple the country and\ndestroy the lives of millions. For\n12 years Iraq suffered under these\nsanctions with an estimated 500,000\nchildren dying as a direct result of\nthe sanctions. Finally, following the\nattacks of 9/11 the USA and Britain\n(without UN backing) invaded Iraq\nin 2003. Then on 9th December 2003\nhe was captured by US forces, found\nin an underground bunker near his\nhome town Tikirit.\nThe trial of Saddam Hussein began in June 2004. He was initially\ntried for the murder of 148 Shias\nof the town of Dujail in 1982. In November 2006 he was found guilty\nof these crimes and sentenced to\ndeath along with 2 other defend-ants, his half-brother and the head\nof the Iraqi court in 1982. His execution was ironically carried out\nat Camp Justice. The day chosen\nwas the 1st day of Eid-al-Adha, one\nof the holiest days on the Islamic\ncalendar. This inflamed the entire\nMuslim world and many were united in condemning the Iraqi government in their handling of his execu-tion. However, there appears to be\nno coincidence in their actions. So\nmany factors went wrong, from the\ndate of his execution to the manner in which it was carried out. It\nwas almost as if someone wanted to\nmaximise the effect his execution\nhad. Why was he tried for only one\nof the many crimes he had com-mitted? What about Halabja? What\nabout Iran? What about Kuwait?\nWhat about all the untold murders\ncommitted against civilians? No\ndoubt conspiracy theorists will be\nitching to give an explanation.\nFor so many years Saddam Hussein was the greatest enemy to almost every Iraqi. However, there\nwas widespread fear amongst the\npeople with his spies infiltrated\namongst the community. Whole\nfamilies would be tortured and\nmurdered if they opposed. Thousands of civilians were condemned\nas he spread his influence. As an\nIraqi Kurd his execution was supposed to bring some relief to me. So\nmany years we Iraqis just dreamed\nof an Iraq without Saddam. We\nprayed that his tyrannic rule would\nend. It appeared that Saddam was\nuntouchable and that we may never\nlivetoseehisruleendedandforIraq\nto be liberated. However, it was the\nmanner of his demise, at the hands\nof the very people who had placed\nhim in power. It was the shameful\nand humiliating invasion and occupation of Iraq by the US and British\nforces. It was the many lies told by\nthe world leaders and the silence\nof many others. I was disgusted to\nsee a report from BBC news which\ndescribed Saddam as the leader of\nthe Sunni world. To call that misinformation would be lying. There is\nno doubt that a very small minority\nof Sunnis supported him, as is the\nThe execution of Saddam\nMustaffa Junaid, an Iraqi Kurd, presents his feelings on the death of Saddam Hussein,\nand what it means for Iraq as the coalition forces struggle to restore order in Baghdad\ncase with these psychotic leaders.\nAs a child I was always asked by my\nfellow classmates whether I liked or\nhated Saddam. I always answered\nthe same way; he was an evil man\nwhom no one liked. What frustrated\nme then and now are the ignorant\nones, including some Iraqis who\nnow see him as a martyr, the only\ntrue opposition to the US. Even in\ndeath he was able to manipulate\nmatters. I am now left with the obscure feeling of injustice. It was too\neasy. After so many years of suffering and worrying this man was\nwiped off within a matter of 2 years.\nHis trial and execution have left a\nbitter taste. The fall of Saddam was\nbizarre, his trial was a circus act\nand his death was surreal. Once he\nwas sentenced to death it left us little chance to reflect before he was\nexecuted. By ending his life they\nhave in fact increased the woes of\nthe Iraqis. There is no longer a hate\nfigure, so what is left? Civil war is\non the cards and it has been the\ncase ever since 2003.\nMuch of what has gone wrong in\nIraq is a direct result of foreign in-fluence, which I have no wish to go\ninto presently. However, there is no\ndoubt what legacy Mr Blair and Mr\nBush have left themselves. They\ninvaded Iraq in 2003 with the false\npretence that they were liberating\na nation and spreading democracy.\nTheyremovedatyrantandreplaced\nhim with a puppet government. The\nworld is united in their condemnation of the US and Britain. The situation in the Middle East has worsened immeasurably, and has now\nbecome the true legacy for Blair\nand Bush. How can a tyrant become\na martyr? That question will haunt\nus for all time.\nThere is little\ndoubt that the\ntyrant that was\nSaddam Hussein\ndeserved death\nSaddam Hussein in 1998 as President of Iraq (left) and after his capture by US troops (right)\n\n"
