    "content": "News in brief\nTWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 7 TH1995 Union Adviser Departs\nMinevar Kavlak is departing from her role as Imperial College Union\nAdviser after two years in the job. She is leaving the College to take\nan educational course as she 'thought that it was time to move on'.\nMinevar is however 'very sad to leave', adding that: 'I'm going to miss\npeople here, they're a good bunch.\" The Union Adviser does feel that\nshe has helped students: \"I think that in my own little way I 've helped\nwho I can. I know who they are and they know who I am.\"\nWhile looking forward to her course - 'it's really funny being a student again' - Minevar considers her time working for the Union as\nwell spent. \"One issue that kept coming up was harassment\" she says,\nadding that this was an area in which she had striven for an official\nICU policy. Equal Opportunities and the Nursery Service were other\nissues which particularly concerned her. Having enjoyed her role in\nICU, she emphasised that, 'challenging people, especially in college',\nwere actions which she found most fulfil ing. Matt Crompton, Deputy President Finance and Services, pointed\nto her work on student accommodation as one of her most influential\nactivities. Expressing disappointment at her departure, Matt illustrated her vital role with an example in which she had recently forced a local landlord to improve the standard of student accommodation in\nthe hostel he runs.\nAlo cum advisor is in place and a permanent replacement will be\nfound in the new year.\nDisappearing Bikes Cannabis Catch\nImperial College has been hit by a string of bicycle thefts in the first\nfew weeks of term, which has led\nto fears that IC is being targeted\nby professional thieves.\nThis series of incidents is\nconcentrated around the Central\nLibrary bicycle racks. Dan\nSeaman (Physics 1) bought his\nbike on the Monday of Freshers'\nWeek and it was stolen the following Friday. He said that his Dlock had jammed so instead he\nused a good quality cable lock to\nsecure his bike. Sue (Physics 2),\nalso using a cable lock, said her\nbike was stolen on the first\nWednesday of Freshers' Week\nBoth victims said they had\ninformed the Police. Asked if he\nhad reported the incident to\nCollege Security, Dan said, \"Of\ncourse I didn't, it would be a complete waste of time.\"\nOne security officer at the\nSecurity Desk in the Sherfield\nbuilding said that bike thefts are\nusually very high during the first\nweek of term because so many\npeople buy new bikes. Asked if\nanything was done to prevent\nbike thefts, she said \"We are\ndoing as much as we can to stop\nthese sorts of things happening\nhere, by fitting cameras and cooperating with the police. But it is\nultimately up to the students to\nlook after their bikes as it is very\ndifficult to catch the thieves.\"\nShe went on to say that the\npolice cannot \"convict someone\nunless we see them in the process\nof stealing a bike. Thieves can\nbreak through any lock, including\ncable and D locks. They break\nthe latter by covering them with\nliquid Nitrogen. It is very difficult\nto spot bike thieves in the act as\nthey are very quick.\"\nThe security officer gave\nsome advice on how to protect\nyour bikes suggesting that stu-dents, code their bikes, insure\ntheir bikes, report any thefts to\nsecurity and that they buy a cheap bicycle.\nA Student Residences Tribunal\nhas concluded the hearing of the\nTizard Hall resident who was\ncaught with cannabis in the first\nweek of term. Following a police\npresence, the Chem Eng student\nwas cautioned, and will face suspension if he re-offends.\nCCS Users Shut Out\nComputer Centre users voiced\nfrustration at the beginning of\nterm when Mech Eng introduced\na policy of shutting its doors at\n8pm. The centre, which is supposed to be open until ten, was\neffectively shut off to all but\nMech Eng students. The move\nwas made after the department\nspent considerable sums installing\nnew lifts and refurbishing the\nbuilding's general amenities\n(including its library) over the\nsummer.\nMr Rogers, the building's Supervisor, said that initial consultations with the Computer\nCentre and College Security\nfailed to highlight the problem\nbut that the building will once\nagain be open till 10 pm as a temporary measure.\nHowever, some form of\nswipe card controlled entry will\nbe implemented, due to the very\nsignificantly increased risk of\nthefts when the doors are left\nopen until late at night.\nWillis Resigned To\nAppeal\nRichard Willis resigned as Rag\nChair pending the result of his\nappeal against his Imperial\nCollege Union Disciplinary. The\nappeal board will hear the case\nsometime next week, and will\nconsist of randomly drawn members of the Union Executive with\nSarah White as chair. Ms White\nsaid that Willis had wanted a second hearing, but that he himself\nhad pointed out that'it would be\ntoo long after the event so \"he'll\nhave to settle for an appeal\".\n\n"

Starting with a small job at the local cable station, she eventually\nrises to the meteoric position of weather girl.\nSuzanne sees this only as a springboard to greater\nthings and sets about making a documentary\nabout the lives of some local teenagers. This\nbrings her into contact with three local deadbeats - Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix), Russell and\nLydia, with whom she forms an unlikely friend-ship. Gradually she drags them into her fantasy\nworld promising them success when she make it\nbig in California.\nShe seduces Jimmy, and in classic film noir\ntradition manipulates him into killing her doting\nhusband (Matt Dillon), who wants her to give up\nher television career to start a family. The murder of her husband finally gives her the media\nattention she craved, but it soon cruelly degenerates as the accusing finger begins to point at\nher.\nTo Die For is shot in a rather non-linear man-ner, composing of a variety of flashbacks with\ncamera interviews in both past and present, creating a wickedly dark and humourous black\ncomedy. The film marks a return to form for the\ndirector, Gus Van Sant, after his disappointing\nefforts of late.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The star of this picture is undoubtedly Nicole Kidman, who finally gets\nto show she can act in an American\nfilm. Although on previous roles she\nseems an unlikely choice for Suzanne, she makes the part seem like it was\nwritten for her. She plays the vamp-ish femme fatale with the right\ndegree of brainless confidence but\nexuding sex appeal to appear seem-less ly natural. She is helped by a supporting cast who in general take a backseat to Kidman's tour de force\nand an excellent script which contains some bitingly satirical scenes,\nespecially about the States' dependence on television.\nAlthough the non-linear storyline\nhelps to keep the film interesting, the\nstory suffers from the jumping\nbetween too many strands, some of\nwhich give too much away while o th1 ers don't explain enough. In addition,\nNicole Kidman's killer comes over as a bit excessively naive and brainless which stretches\ncredulity too much in places. In the States,\nwhere stupidity seems to be revered (see the\nfarce that was Forrest Gump) this probably\nworked, but over here it makes it less easy to\nswallow, although at least the film isn't another\nadvert for the American dream.\nHowever, these are minor details and you\ncould certainly make a worse choice of film. It's mainly for those who like their films black with\na bit of bite.\n-video: bad lieutenant e my Many films have, alphabetically, contained alcohol abuse, bad language, bribery, cocaine\n(snorted, smoked and dealt), corruption, gam-bling, guns, heroin, Jesus, masturbation,\nmenage a trois, murder, prostitution, rape, sex,\nsuicide, theft and visions. But this film only has\none character.\nA lifestyle that would leave you physically\nand mentally mined in a week is lived by this\nimmortal figure. All America's evil's rolled into\none man - and he is a policeman. A powerful\nstatement? Nothing compared to the li ihi list ic and frightening power of the film. Even two\ndays later I am left listless and frustrated.\nThe film's plot is the background, its style\nis all. Don't watch it - it's excellent but no possible pleasure could be gained from doing so.\nNothing more to say.\n\n"

The usual\nprocession of vehicles comprising a overloaded hire van and a new and\ncomfortable ICU minibus (now there's a novelty), towing the RIB (a rigid hulled\ninflatable boat), set off for Oban in Scotland.\nAfter a day and a half of travelling via a youth hostel in Wales and some very\nprecarious mountain \"short cuts\", we arrived\nin Tralee Bay Caravan Site, our home for the\nnext eight days. Weather conditions couldn't have been better, with temperatures reaching\n30 degrees midweek, and glassy flat waters.\nThe first day was used to finish training\nsome of the experienced novices, and give the\nnew novices their first taste (literally) of open\nwater diving.

S. Breda, a WWII cargo ship\nwhich sank in the shallow water of the bay.\nThis 420 ft long wreck has something to suit\nevery diver, whether novice or advanced,\nwith lots to be found for those who like to\nrummage in the cargo holds.\nIn addition to the wrecks in the Sound of\nMull, the afternoons were often used for\nrelaxing scenic dives amongst the underwater\n\"kelp forests\", or seal watching dives just off\nGreag Island. Naturally curious, the resident\nseals would follow the surface marker buoys\nand occasionally buzz the divers below.\nNeedless to say there were some very happy\nand wide-eyed divers who returned to surface\nthat day.\nWhen not diving the RIB was put to good\nuse for water-skiing and the warm evenings\nwere spent on the beach having barbecues and\ngenerally drinking too much.\nThe regular Albatross award, a broken\npropel lor on a neck chain, was passed to John\nMoore for his boat handling escapades, which\nalso prompted the suggestion of renaming the\nRIB \"Rock magnet\".

    "content": "TWENTY-SIX . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 0 TH1995 LETTERS\nLETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY RACHEL WALTERS^^ ill is or\nWon't? Dear Editor,\nI am writing to question strongly\nthe verdict reached by the Union\nDisciplinary against the Rag\nChair, Mr Richard Willis.\nThe fresher involved in the\nincident, according to the report\npubis he d in Felix, was seen purchasing a pint of strong cider in\nDa Vinci's Bar, after leaving the\nrag meeting. May I point out that\nbefore this stage, Mr Willis had\nalready noted the condition of\nthe student, and had advised\nhim/her to not have any more.\nIf this is the case, I must call\ninto question the actions of the\nbar staff, who are required, under\nboth Union regulations, and the\nterms and conditions of the bar's licence) to refuse to serve alcoholic drinks to any person who\nobviously under the influence of\nalcohol. Breach of licence regulations can lead to withdrawal of\nthe licence if a complaint is\nmade, and I am sure there is\ncause for a complaint here.\nSurely the Union should take\naction to ensure that future\nbreaches of the rules do not lead\nto external action being taken\nagainst them.\nPerhaps we should ask\nwhether College Security, who\nfeel that Mr Willis took all necessary action in this incident, would\nsimilarly absolve the Union Bar\nstaff of any blame for their part\nin the incident.\nI must also ask why the first-year student involved was apparently not considered by the\nUnion disciplinary to be guilty of\n\"failing to act responsibly\", or\n\"bringing the Union into disrepute\". Presumably the student is\nold enough to be considered an\nadult, and therefore to be responsible for his/her own actions.\nWhy should Mr Willis, who\nin my view may be guilty only of\na lack of foresight, take the blame\nentirely for the actions of others,\npossibly in breach of Union regulations, and - more importantly -the law?\nJonathan Hall\nComputing II\nAntag on is m at IC Dear Felix,\nAt the first ICU Council\nMeeting of the 1995/1996 academic year, our Deputy President\nClubs & Societies Tim Townend\nsaid something like this -\"... any way we are a different type of College (University)\nfor we have many foreign students and none of them give a shit about what happens to the\nUnion; they are just here to get\ntheir degrees\".\nBeing a foreigner I felt undignified. I am Departmental\nRepresentative & Treasurer of the\nSki Club. So how can he make\nsuch accusations? I work hard\nand do my best for all the students I represent and know. So\nhow can someone in his position,\nholding so much information and\npower, say something of the is kind? For his benefit I will point\nout the Physics Department has\ntwo representatives which are\nforeigners and were the only ones\nto stand for the post.\nSo I guess we give a \"shit\" to\nwhat happens to the Union. We\nalso attend all council meetings. I myself also attend the ACC meetings. Therefore I hope he\nwill formally apologize to all the\nforeign students in College that\ncare about what happens to the\nUnion?\nDaniel Figueros-Niets\nPhysics Student, Departmental Representative, and Ski\nClub Treasurer\nMark Praise\nRachel,\nWe felt that we had to write\nto you so that you could pass our\ncongratulations on to Mark for\nlast Friday night.\nNot only were \"My Life\nStory\" really good but the music\nall night was outstanding. In fact\nit was undoubtedly the most\nenjoyable time we've had at the\nUnion in the last 3 years.\nAs a well known publication\nwould say \"keep it up. Good\nwork fella\"\nLove,\nChris Ince et al\nUnhappy\nVi rg ins\nDear Editor,\nFor a publication starved of\nnews other than that regarding\nfire alarms and computer thefts\nthe Imperial College Ladies'\nRugby Football Club takes exception to the belittling of their feats\nto obscurity behind \"Features\"\nmeriting Colin the Glassblower,\nAnne the Archivist, countless\nEnts plugs and ham fist ed pages\nwith writers maze-like lines\nreplacing column inches. It seems\nremarkable that a journal produced by students for students\nhas the gall to ignore worthy\neffort by a group of such funded\nby the same source as the publication whilst devoting space to the\nemployees of College, the administration of which is frequently\nexpo used in the same editions.\nI am most interested to hear\nof the editorial decision taken to\npublish not even an edited version of the match report following IC Virgins 60-0 victory over\nUCL yet substantial space was\ndevoted to other teams'\nmediocre results. Could it be that\nyour sports editor knows as little\nabout sport as he does about\nEnts?\nCatharine Byrne\nVice-Captain ICLRFC\nI was decide ly taken aback\nby the sheer volume of sports\nreports that suddenly appeared\nlast week: after a rather lackluster start to the term, we were\nsuddenly inundated with a pile\nof fairly random scraps of paper.\nIt seemed fairest to give priority\nto those reports which came in\nfirst, rather than to discriminate\non the basis of the score. Do you\nreally think that you should be\npreferred over clubs that produce 'mediocre' results just\nbecause you do rather well?\nYour article arrived after\neveryone else's, and there was\nalready ample material for a full\npage. But in the interests of harmony I sought out one of your\nteammates in the bar that\nevening to apologise for its om is sion: she told me that it didn't matter at all. Apparently the rest\nof the team didn't know what\nyou had written and weren't sure\nthey would be happy with it.\nI was expecting to give your\narticle priority treatment this\nweek, but none was forth com ing. Is this because Felix doesn't merit your endeavours, or is it\nbecause you lost?\nI'm very sorry about the\ndeadline confusion, it clearly\nwasn't helpful. It's difficult to\nset a precise time after which it's too late to submit, because obviously it depends on the volume\nwe've already had, but as a guideline for the future, 8pm Wednesday would be helpful.\nI would happily set aside\nmore space each week for sport\nif I had any guarantee that it\ncould be filled... I hope this\nweek's offering is more accurate:\nI think everyone has been fitted\nin.\nI'm still looking for a permanent sports editor: would you\nbe interested?\n\n"

    "content": "Alan Parker,\nUrban\nWarrior\nThey had another \"Who's the most left-wing person in the\npub?\" competition the other night.\nThey asked me to enter. I said that I didn't agree with the concept of competition\ngenerally, let alone IN A PUB - the very rock\nof equality and democracy in this country. So I won. Which was good really. I got a new\nmegaphone and a year's supply of placards - enough\nfor about 20 marches of 100 people each.\nBeing a bit of a 'one man political force', the second\nbit didn't seem that useful so I thought, \"I know, I 'll sell\nthem to the Revolutionary Communists and raise some\nmoney for my party fund (and by that I mean a PARTY fund\nbecause it strikes me that only by GETTING PISSED that\nwe're going to achieve some REALISTIC CHANGE in this\ncountry - \"The personal revolution is the first step in any\nrevolution\" say The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy - Cheers\nto them, but some of us KNEW THAT ALREADY and as the\nsaying goes \"have been in the pub since half past five\").\nUnfortunately the Rev Corns were down to 14 members and\ndidn't really need that many placards either. So I tried the \"Fourth\nTerm - Fourth Reich\" group. They're a small new group but\nthey've got big ambitions. Problem is, they're really against the\nwhole buying and selling bourgeois-capitalist thing. But I lowered\nthe price a bit and in the end they took the whole lot.\nWhat did I do with the money? I SPENT IT. Don't talk to me\nabout \"saving for a rainy day\" - you\nstart saving money the next thing is\nyou'll be getting a mortgage, a pony\nand a servant and calling yourself\n\"Lord of the Manor\". Yeah. Non,\nMerci Mein Fuhrer. Any money I can't immediately piss up the wall I BURN as a gesture of defiance.\nApart from coins which bitter\nexperience has taught me to not\nburn under any circumstances.\nWho am I defying by burning\nmoney? (YOU ask) Well,\n\"logic, for a start,\" to quote\nthe bar person in The\nHalfway House. But (as I replied) as long as I remain\nUNPREDICTABLE\nI shall be an UNGOVERNABLE\nFORCE.\nTake that\nhome\nNETWORK\nwith you and\nburn it in\nyour oven.\nI 've found another unusual oppresses\nminority to support - STUDENTS. People\nhate students. I was a student once, and I hated\nMYSELF - CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLE\nMAN. If one of the ordinary decent working-class\npeople of this country said to me \"What do you do\nmate?\" I'd say, \"I'm a bleeding student waster toss\nhead\" and then I'd punch myself in the mouth just to let\nthem know I really meant it, and also to save them the\ntrouble. But I don't think that it's right. I didn't mean to\nbecome a student though. I was FORCED INTO IT by the\ncombined effect of society's pressures and my extremely high\n'A' level results.\nI didn't go easy, I put up a fight. When my call up papers\ncame, drafting me into the army, I burnt them.\nThat's right - I burnt my 'A' level certificates. You come up to\nme at one of my gigs and I 'll show them to you (photocopies of\ncourse - the actual burnt certificates I framed and gave to my\nMum. She was really moved). I didn't like it very much as a student. They were always having demos and that but I didn't really fit in with any of their 'organisations' - too radical probably.\nFor example I was thrown out of the first meeting of the Anti Nazi\nLeague because I stood up and shouted, \"come on, admit it - we are\nall Nazis in some ways; we all admire the uniforms.\" Another group\ntold me to piss off because I suggested\ntaking an air rifle to lectures and\nshooting the lecturers if they said\nanything unsound. Made me despair.\nSo I set up my own ANTI student\ndemonstration. Only one blok e came\nto it. And it turned out he thought\nit was an anti-STUDENT demo -you know, against students. He\nhated them.\nAnyway, we got talking, I explained to him the situation,\none thing led to another, and\nhe smacked me in the gob. I remember laying there in\nthe gutter saying to\nhim, \"yes mate, I see your\npoint. On your side.\"\nBut now I think\ndifferent: Students,\nI am on your side\nas well.\nCheers to\nyou.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 2 7 TH OCTOBER 1 9 9 5 . FIVE\nUnited Nations?\nThis week has seen the celebrations of half a century\nsince the establishment of the\nUnited Nations. It has been\nfifty years since the Allies won\nthe war and laid the foundation stones in San Francisco of\nwhat was called the United\nNations Organisation.\n: today, the UN has expanded\nbeyond recognition - it has become\na giant consisting of a plethora of\nagencies and their acronyms;\nUNDP, UN HP. W1PO, UNCTAD, IMF, IAEA, WHO, FAO,\nUNI ICR, I FAD, WFP... and the\nlist goes on. The UN agencies are\nconcerned with issues such as the\npromotion of human rights, agri-culture, health, patents, telecom-muni cations, refugees,.and education to name a few. Most: people\nhave the misconception that all the\nUN does is peace keeping, and in\nsome cases even go to war.\nThe United: Nations Charter,\nArticle 1, reads as follows :\n\"The Purposes of the United\n::\nNations .ire :\n1. To maintain international\npeace and security, and to that\nend: to take effective collective\nmeasures lor the prevention and\nremoval of threats to the peace,\nand for the suppression of the acts\nof aggression...\"\nI las the UN been able to do\nthis? Is there international peace?\nIt has been a couple of generations\nsince the charter was written, but\nunfortunately the UN has not been\nable to keep peace. There have\nbeen countless wars since the charter was signed in San Francisco: the\nKorean war, Arab-Israeli wars, two\nGulf wars, the Falkland* war and\nso on. Was Article I expressing\noptimism or was it a sheer Utopian\nstatement ?: We all know that since\n1945 there has not been a single\nday of global peace. Even today\nthere are myriad wars being\u2022-fought and from Bosnia: to Somalia, Sri\nLanka to: Afghanistan there arc-sounds of children .screaming and\nKalashnikovs rattling. We can\nunequivocally say that the UN is\nnot doing its to b properly.\nArticle 55 of the UN Chatter\nstates that one of the principle\naims of the UN is to promote:\n'higher living standards, full\nemployment and conditions of\neconomic and social progress- as\nwell as to find:solutions for 'inter-national economic, social, health\nrelated problems; and international\ncultural and educational co-opera-tion ' Indeed the UN and its\nagencies have st n ved to achieve the\nabove goals, but it is far from\nachieving: them. There is mass\nunemployment and civil strife, and\nliving standards in some parts of\nthe world leave much to be\ndesired.\nThe UN is crippled, bankrupt\nand needs to be changed radically.\nThe answer lies in its own charter,\nwhich states that the permanent\nmembers of the Security: Council\n(China, Russia, the United\nKingdom, France and the US)\nshould have veto powers with\nregards to any decisions taken by\nthe General Assembly or any other\nUN body. During: the Cold War\nwc saw that this had a detrimental\neffect on many proceedings\nbecause the Soviet Union vetoed-any proposal that affected its inter-est s, and the US vetoed any actions\nsuggested by the Communist\nBlock. This rendered the UNa dead donkey,: and its General\nAssembly speeches consisted of\nrhetoric and bright -ideas but no\nactions, especially in matters of\npeace keeping. Today, one of the\nsuperpowers is gone and the UN\nhas become synonymous with the\nUS. All five permanent members\nput their national: interests first,\nthereby-eliminating the possibility\nof any ground breaking reforms\nThe United States alone owes over\n$1 billion m arrears, and the tight\nfist ed Republican Congress is not\nwilling to pay up because it is trying to reduce its government budget deficit.\nThe United Nations must\nchange to accommodate tor the\nchanging times, and it needs its\nown powers to implement and\nenforce peace. In order to do so\nthe UN charter has got to be\namended and the permanent five\nmust loosen their grip on the\nSecurity Council. The Secretary\nGeneral needs to he delegated\nmore powers because what we see\n\u2022\u2022today is that Boutos Ghah relegated to the sidelines by the Secretary\nGeneral of NATO in the Bosnian\nconflict. We need a UN that is genuinely committed to achieving its\nmandate.\nAs for Article 55, the United.\nNations needs to cut down its: layers of bureaucracy and to slim\ndown its agencies that overlap m many areas. The UN should'1\nbe\nused as an organ for transferring\nknowledge, wealth and expertise\nfrom richer to poorer countries,\nthereby helping them to prosper.\nProsperous people will never go to\nWar, so it is in everyone's interests\nto make the United Nations a success. AITA\n\n"

And who knows, maybe what\ngoes around will come around back to us.\"\nThese are not the words of one of the\nhideously self-deceived landlords in South\nKensington who think that offering sardine-friendly rooms to students for aristocracy-friend-ly prices constitutes a philanthropic al feat worthy of a Nobel Prize. And neither are they the\nwords of a Mother Theresa-styled visionary on a genuine humanitarian crusade. No, thus spake\nChris Colbourn, bassist and second vocalist with\nBoston guitar trio, Buffalo Tom, on the blower\nfrom their Milwaukee hotel.\nNow to the uninitiated this might seem like\na somewhat pretentious statement. However, if\ncreating forty-five minutes of integrity-soaked\nsuch as the emotive, Van Morrison-esque epic,\n'Sunday night', and the punk-tinged Neil Youngacised 'Tangerine', that should be termed great\nby anyone's definition. The latter song, in par-ti cula r, is indicative of a raw streak that pervades\nthe album. Chris explained:\n\"Well, it was a reaction to the last record\n(1994's 'Big Red Letter Day') where we spent\nthree months in the studio. This time we really\ndidn't want to spend too much time recording.\nAlso, we wanted to stay close to home. Tom's( Tom Maginnis, drummer) wife was eight\nmonths pregnant and he had to leave every couple of days for baby classes! So we recorded\nmost of the songs live. We had a Stones' 'Some\nGirls' album attitude where we just went in and\nblasted it out.\"\nAnd of course, with the album recorded live,\nplaying live is now second nature.\nmusic (the Tom's fifth album, 'Sleepy Eyed')\nand putting on superb live performances don't classify as virtues, then Saddam Hussein is a member of the 'Fair Election, Let's Give the\nPeople a Fair Vote' Society.\nNot that enough people have recognised\nBuffalo Tom's virtue or virtuosity. Over the\ncourse of their seven year history they've been\nlumped in with everyone from The\nLemonheads to Dinosaur Jr. In reality they possess a blue-collar, down-to-earth (lack of) attitude missing from both those bands. Do they\nresent being the perpetual underdogs?\n\"No, we don't mind. I 've always known that\nif we sold five million records then the reviews\nof our records would change. Even when we\nstarted to sell 100,000 records journalists started\nto say that we weren't that great any more. You\ncould say that part of our problem is that we\ndon't have an Evan Dando frontman or a singer\nwho's died of a heroin overdose. And it's just not\nin our blood to write a hit single like 'Runaway\nTrain'.\"\nMaybe not, but 'Sleepy Eyed' hoards songs\n\"We've been touring for months already and\nwe'll be coming to Britain soon (Shepherd's Bush Empire on November 4th). We're really\nlooking forward to it. I still have this romantic\nview of all these towns and villages in Britain...\nAnd then there's always the ludicrous side of the\nBritish music scene.\"\nBritish music scene, ludicrous?\n\"Well, British music has this ridiculous side to it. I mean, Mr. Blobby and Whigfield - how\nseriously can you take them?\"\nYes, but what about Britpop? Isn't all this arty\nlack of musical talent, lad dish behaviour and\nAdidas track suits exactly what the public needs?\n, \"I think that Blur and Oasis are so comic\nbook, kind of like something that should be on\nSaturday morning children'sTV They're very\nentertaining and very theatre and that's a side of\nthings that too many American bands forget\nabout.

We' ve\nbeen able to expand our activities\ntremendously thanks to some devoted\nmembers of staff: Prof. Pat Holmes from Civ.\nEng, now Commodore of the Yacht Club, and\nJim Gibb from Physics, Senior Treasurer and\nalso enthusiastic social event co-organiser.\nThe main activities of the Club are\nconcentrated over two areas: training and\nracing. We try to put a large emphasis on the\ntraining since most of our members are\ncomplete beginners. We encourage everybody\nto take theory and practical RYA exams so\nthat they obtain a worldwide qualification\nenabling to rent boats out. In the last 3 years\nbetween 10 and 15 people each year have\nwalked through the RYA Yachtmaster theory\ncourse.

We have all heard of investments\nlike bonds and derivatives, but do you know\nwhat they are used for, and more importantly\nwhat effects their price?\nThis year's plans include fantasy share..\nConSoc\nFor those of you who don't think this week's speaker, Michael Portillo, was important\nenough, Conservative Students have\norganised a National Parlimentary Rally in the\nGrand Committee Room of the Houses of\nParliament for this Wednesday.\nOrdinary students like you will be able to\nput their questions and views to the people\nwho run the country: people like the Foreign\nSecretary, Deputy Prime Minister, Party\nChairman and at least three other Cabinet\nMinisters. And for the first time, we will be\nallowed to social is e with them, as well as\nother students, in the wine break in the\nmiddle of the proceedings. We will meet at\nSouth Kensington tube station at 2.00 pm and\nthe entrance fee is \u00a34. The visit will also\nstaff will be able to teach the course at\nCollege, making it more flexible and probably\ncheaper. Not only the Club does its best to\norganise these courses but the tuition fees are\nalso heavily sub sidi sed. Our main objective for this year is to\nimprove on our 10th position obtained at the\nBritish Yachting Nationals last year and beat\nthe South coast Universities at their own\ngame. Also the prospects are good of going\nracing in France over Easter in one of the\nmany massive Student Regattas.\nOur program for this year consists of\ncompeting in the Hamble Winter Series and\nsome of the Sunsail Regattas during the\nWinter Term. Then a provisional crew of 10\nto 12 will be selected to train for the\nNationals held at the end of March, before\nwe pack our oilskin s and head to France to\ncompete with the best of the Europeans. .\nIf any of these activities tempt you, come\nalong to one of our meetings held every\nThursday from 1 - 2pm, Physics LT2 to\nshare some of our members experience, or get\nin touch with Carlo on 0171-935 3685 or via\ne mail: c. cont aldi@ ic.ac.uk.\ntrading, talks and visits.

We will be gathering\nbeforehand for our usual weekly meeting in\nSouthside Upper Lounge at 1.00pm to\ndiscuss the issues we should raise.\nJust to prove that we are a social club as\nwell, we have planned a few social outings for\nthe coming days. On Friday, we will be\nvisiting the splendid Orthodox Westminster\nCathedral for a performance of Bruckner's9 th Symphony. The following Saturday we\nwill celebrate the defeat of the most infamous\nFull ahead Captain Blighl\ninvestment and financial terminology.

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 27TH1995 NEWS\nPortillo Visit Passes Peacefully\nBY THE NEWS TEAM On Wednesday Michael\nPortillo, Conservative Defence\nMinister, appeared as a guest of\nConsoc. Launching himself into a half hour speech with an anti-Labour anecdote, he was on fighting form.\nMr Portillo asserted that the\nConservative government is the\nonly one that has made (and will\nkeep) Britain competitive. He\ngave the example of microchip\nfactories to illustrate how the\ncountry must invest in business to\nstay part of the global market.\nCiting the Far East's positive attitude to education he stated \"we\nhave to re-establish the concept\nthat education is a privilege\".\nThrough education the country would achieve intellectual\nexcellence and through this the\ncountry would become more\ncompetitive. He questioned the\n\"self depreciating\" attitude of\nmany British citizens towards the\ncountry itself and asked why people who make money through\nbusiness are denigrated or\ndespised. His was the party\n\"unleashed against the politics of\nenvy\".\nTalking about the European\nCommunity Mr Portillo stumbled\nover the Maastricht Treaty. He\nstated that Britain wants to be a \"high wage\" economy, as it can't compete on low wages, but also\njustified the social chapter opt-out stating that \"social standards\ncan only be acquired when we can\nafford them\". This lies opposite\nthe \"society of law, order ...\nrespect and care\" he cited, at\nanother point in his speech.\nMr Portillo then took questions from the floor, which were\nsurprisingly un hostile. His only\nsticky moment came when he was\nunable to find a question from a female student - eventually one\nwas raised by an older lady.\nMr Portillo did not speak on\nwhat supposed to be his area of\nexpertise - defence - to the main\ngroup, however later during a short exclusive Felix interview he\ndid comment on the Bosnian situ-ation. He defended the Tory\ndefence strategy, advocating a NATO-centred solution. Reiterating the views expressed in his\nrecent controversial speech made\nat the Conservative conference,\nhe rejected the idea of a joint\nEuropean strategy. Whilst admitting that the handling of the former Yugoslavian crisis hadn't always been coherent, he insisted\nthat the Government's handling\nof the situation had been right.\nThe campaign had been 'more\nsuccessful than was recognised,'\nhe said.\nDespite rumours that his\nappearance would be met with\njeers and rotten eggs, Mr Portillo's visit, guarded by a heavy police\npresence, passed off peacefully.\nICU Labour Club have\ndenied knowledge of flyers that\nappeared around IC calling for\nPortillo's speech to be picketed.\nThe \"Stop Miguel Portaloo\"\nleaflets incorporated the Labour\nClub emblem, but the society\ninsisted that the logo must have\nbeen photocopied off their own\nposters as a prank.\nJacob Tomkins, Honourary\nPresident of the Labour Club\ninsisted that that they would\nnever advocate disruptive behaviour. \"The more people that go\nand see Michael Portillo the bet-ter, because he's a great advert for\nthe Labour club,\" he said. \"We\nwant to encourage people like him\nto visit.\"\nCity & Guilds College Associatio\nCareer Networking Reception\nat the National Liberal Club\nMeet past Guilds Students already working in\nEngineering, the Professions and the City\nThursday 2nd November\nWine & Refreshments FREE to CGCA Members\nStudent CGCA membership is only \u00a33\nMore information from the Guilds Office, Level 3 ,\nMech Eng, or Room 301, Sherfield Building\n\n"

His appearance was\nonly marred by the inability of certain students to gain access to the\novercrowded lecture hall.\nEstates Back Down\non Sherfield Move\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nCollege authorities announced\nthis week that plans to move the\nUnion to the Sherfield building\nwere 'on hold' following fears\nover the rising costs for the\nscheme. The Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, told a meeting of the\nGovernors last Friday that the\nprojected expenditure was spiralling out of control beyond the\noriginal budget.\nThe architects, Sir Norman\nFoster and Partners, came up\nwith the designs for the area\naround the Queen's Lawn, to create a \"centre of dawn to dusk\nactivity.\" Ian Caldwell, Director\nof Estates, said \"the costs appear\nto be higher than we feel comfortable with... especially to meet\nthe brief [setting out the Union's minimum requirements].\" Other\nsources say that costs are up to\nfive times over the budget of\napproximately \u00a33 million, and no\nnew money can be found.\nWhen asked about the decision to put the move on hold, Ian\nCaldwell replied that \" ICU are\nnot enthusiastic about the\nContraceptive Pill Scare provokes Strong Reaction\nImperial College Health Centre\nhas been inundated with telephone calls this week as controversial new research suggests that\ncertain contraceptive pills are\nhighly dangerous. The national\nmedia con ver age given to the\nreport has provoked a reaction\nfrom worried staff and students.\nDr Weinreb is attempting to allay\nfears and restore calm the fraught\nsituation. Page3\nmove... Also, the costs are quite\nhigh, so the move has to be financially justifiable.\" He stressed\nthat the College wanted to provide student facilities that would\nbe the 'envy of many colleges',\nbut he insisted that funding for\nthe scheme would have to be\nrecovered from increased accommodation revenue in Beit Quad.\nICU President Sarah White\nsaid that the decision was \"won-de rful news\". She added that the\nRector had given ICU the chance\nto push for the 'Beit Option', and\nto emphasise the advantages and\nsavings from staying there. She\nwas adamant that the Union had\npressed the importance of keeping the range of its facilities with\nthe architects, and their proposal\nreflected this, coming in way\nover the 'unrealistic' budget for\nthe plan and still only just accept-able.\nTalking about the Union's ideas for Beit, Ian Caldwell said\n\"We are having a quick look at\nthat as an option\". However, he\niterated that there would have to\nbe changes 'to keep the disturbances down', including moving\nthe exit to the north side of the\nbuilding and some acoustic\nremodelling of the inside to\nreduce the noise. He expressed\nsurprise at the \"affinity that the\npeople involved had for their current 'homes'\" and the strength of\nfeeling about the move.\n\n"

I thought to myself that surely\nthat many people can't be all wrong but my initial impressions were not good.\nThe album looked pretentious beyond belief\nwith all its spiritual messages and sleeve notes\nwhich were so long and meaningless that only\nsomeone with no more paint to watch drying\ncould even contemplate reading them.\nHowever, if you get past the packaging and\nactually get down to listening to it, you will - and\nI jest not here - be very surprised indeed. Bearing\nin mind that the tracks are supposed to be chants\nof Native Americans in their natural homes, the\nnumber of un-Native American instruments\nused is quite astounding. The synthesisers and\nguitars are useful for creating the music, but personally I 've never seen or heard the chief of a tribe presiding over a rain dance where there is a band full of keyboards providing harmonies to\nthe chants.\nThe tides of the songs also make good read-ing. For example, we have the\n'Counterclockwise circle dance', and the\n'Intertribal dance to stop the rain'. Future Sound\nof London, eat your heart out.\nThe result of all this is that this is just another Ecstasy of St. Theresa and FSOL-style record.\nIt's nothing new but it still makes fairly good listening if you're spaced out. If you can forget the\nspiritual messages and pretend that this is an\nalbum by a new band who just happen to use a few chants here and there, then I'm sure you'll\nlike it, especially if you are into the aforementioned FSOL.\nAnd it does have another use. If there is ever\na summer like the last one again, you oo ul d put\nthe rain dance on and run around outside in the\nfaint hope that it would work. Or then again,\nmaybe not... (6)\ngigi sleeper+60 ft. dolls +\nthe wanna dies mr.1^ The Wannadies kick off this Indolent Records\nspec tact u lar but unfortunately they turn out to\nbe very dull. They consist of three guys and an\nextremely irritating girl who seems to add nothing to their music. Not that their music is anything to write home about. They just sound like\nany of a host of late '80s indie bands who all\nsound the same.\nThe 60ft. Dolls, on the other hand, we re\na very pleasant surprise. Their sound is a mix of Oasis, Green Day and Offspring\nwhile the variation of lead singers helps to\nkeep them visually interesting. One to\nwatch out for.\nFrom the minute Sleeper hit the stage,\neveryone in the Empire knows that it's going to turn out to be something special.\nLead singer, Louise is a star. Her stage\npresence has improved so much in the\npast year that it is hard to believe that it's the same person up there. The band\nplayed all the hits from their album,\n'Smart', while they even manage to play a Pixies rip-off and make it sound great.\nIf you haven't seen them yet, don't miss out\nnext time.\nalbum i steely dan - alive in\namerica t, TOS c dick\nMusic didn't exist before 1977, that's obvious.\nAt least that's what I thought as a happily half-dead, pummelled pre-pubescent in the midst of\na Buzzcocks orgy at the De Montfort Hall all\nthose years ago. And whilst I still bele ive that\n'70s disco has only been bettered in its awfulness\nby the dross that pertains to be today's chart\nmusic, I guess that we all mellow with age (if\nyou're mellow now then I'm glad that I never met\nyou when you were young - music ed.) and allow\na little melody to influence our lives.\nFor me it was juxtaposition of Coltrane's bebop mingled with the '80s genius of Blue Nile.\nNow for those of you who know your musical\ngenres you will astute enough to have observed a gap of some 30 years between the two. Enter\nSteely Dan. Now everything fits. To attempt to\ndescribe their music would be crass. Suffice to\nsay, anybody who is anybody has borrowed from\nMessrs. Fagan and Becker.\nAdulation over, this is a live album, beautifully performed, especially the drop-dead gor-geo us, 'Third World Man'. And whilst its not the\nbest introduction to the band (noticeable\nabsences include Gaucho, Deaco Blue, Pretzel\nBlue and Ricky don't lose that number), it is still\na must for anyone whose been bitten by the\nDan.\nThe album was recorded between '93 and\n'94 in America. Typical - the '70s is back, they've\ngot the music while we've got the flares and the\ntank tops. And wasn't it Donald Fagan himself\nwho, in 'Babylon Sisters', sang,\n\"Turn that jungle music down.\" Ahead of his\ntime or what? (8)\n\n"

    "content": "Of all the zany goings-on around London,\none in particular has\nattracted my attention:\npigeons riding the\nUnderground.\nStanding quietly on platforms,\nseemingly waiting for trains, travelling\nnonchalantly in carriages along with\namazed commuters, alighting at particular\nstops...This is the surprising behaviour of\nLondon's pigeon population, recently\nreported in New Scientist.\nOne reader writes that during the\nseventies he regularly encountered a particular pigeon who would board the\ntube at Paddington and disembark at the\nnext stop. Another commuter shared her\ncarriage with a pigeon who got on at King's Cross and stood patiently by the door,\nrefusing titbits, until it flew out at Euston.\nIndeed, the birds\nappear to act as if they\nknow exactly what\nthey are doing. One\npigeon apparently\nmade numerous\nattempts to board a Piccadilly line train at\nHounslow Central.\nEven after being\nrepeatedly shooed out\nby a concerned\npassenger, the bird,\ndetermined to board,\nmade one final 'frantic\nswoop' towards the\ndoors as they closed.\nStay awake and you might see the avian\nhitch-hikers in action for yourself - there\nhave been reported sightings on most\nlines.\nSo what is going on? There is no doubt\nthat pigeons aren't shy about travelling on\nthe Tube, but are they doing it\npurposefully? Could pigeons have learned\nthey can quickly and easily travel to a new\nfeeding ground by going one or two stops\nFare dodgers?\n>in\nAre Pigeons Going Homing On\nThe Tube?\non the Tube? Could it have something to\ndo with their renowned navigational\nability? To answer these questions, Insight\ntalked to pigeon expert, Dr Simon Tonge...\nWhat does the Bird\nMan Say?\n'Any such observations should be taken with a pinch of salt.\" says Dr Tonge, ornithologist and\nsenior curator at London Zoo. He felt that\nanyone who maintained that the pigeons knew\nwhere they were going had \"seriously\noverestimated the skull power of these birds,\nthey are not in the front\nranks of bird\nintelligence. People can\nbe terribly unobservant\nwhen it comes to this\nsort of thing, they think\nthey've seen something,\nand read too much into\nit.\"\nDr Tbnge's analysis was\nthat any bird could catch\nthe Tube. Pigeons are\nthose most likely to be\nspotted because they are\ncommon and habituated\nto being around people.\nThey'll hop into a carriage in search of food, not notice the doors\nclosing and therefore are un flustered whilst the\ntrain is moving. When they see the doors\nopening, they'll hop out. Certainly there is no\nchance that the pigeons are navigating their way\naround. Pigeons need to be up in the air to get\ntheir bearings.\n\"You could ask 10,000 ornithologists and get\njust as many different answers, but the rump of\nthe opinion would be that there is nothing in it.\"\nBird Tales\nStaggering amounts ol time and money have gone into the investigation oi navigational ability\nin birds, particularly to determine how migr at or x birds know when and where to 'fly south for\ndescendant ol die North African and Southern European R< x kI)o\\ e{ Colmnba Una) and a direct relation to the (oral pigeon whit h craps on Nelson s column and rides the I Underground.\npro bab h navigate instinctive l\\ using a combination of the sun, a built in magnetic compass and a memorised 'map' ol scenery, sounds and familiar smells. When navigating in flight, a bird\napparently first determines the compass direction o>;C: i| if\nbeneath. Then by alor ni of vector navigation, it homes', flying on a compass bearing until it\nji reach il sai familiar i area around the destination.\nSince the days of the ancient\nEgyptians, pigeons have been used to\ncarry messages. They were used as\n'pigeon post' in civilian and military\nservice by the Greeks, Romans, and\nthroughout the Middle East. At the\nsiege of Paris in 1870, 150,000\nofficial messages and 1 million private messages\nwere carried by pigeons. During the Second\nWorld War, the British and US armies made use\nof200,000 and 50,000 birds respectively. Nearly\n17,000 were parachuted to the Resistance in\noccupied Europe...parachuted?\nThe advent of speedy long distance\ntransport led to the development of\nthe sport of pigeon racing. The first\nrace, in 1818, was over 100 miles\nand was held in Belgium. Today,\nthere are about 100,000 pigeon\nracers in Britain alone, with an\namazing 2 million pigeons in their\nlofts.\nResearcher Shigeru Watanabe and\nhis colleagues at Keio University in\nTokyo have recently had remarkable\nsuccess in training pigeons to tell the\ndifference between paintings by\nPicasso and Monet. Perhaps they\nshould be judging the Turner Prize?\nC. Gull, Nat Barb\nXVI\n\n"

The talk will be\ngiven by the renowned cyclist and explorer,\nNick Crane. Nick will be talking about his\nexpedition on horseback to war torn\nAfghanistan. This was carried out with local\npeople with the aim of assessing war damage\nfor Afghan Aid. They then had an epic return\njourney in which both men and horses\nperished. As many will know, Nick is a superb lecturer and his talk should prove to\nbe highly entertaining. There will be an\nopportunity afterwards for an informal\ndiscussion with Nick for those contemplating\na similar adventure.\nLast Thursday, Phil Wickins gave an\nintroductory lecture, encouraging even those\nwith no experience to go exploring. The\nquestion so many people ask is, \" How do you\nmanage to get the experience to do\nsomething like this?\" Phil himself entered\ncollege having done \"a little\" climbing and\nother outdoor activities. Through\nparticipation in IC Scout and Guide - the\nOutdoor club, Phil progressed to the stage\nwhere he was confident enough to go to\nremote corners of the World and \"explore\".\nFinally, \"Intrepid Phil\" had the confidence to\ntackle Tirich Mir this year. Located near to\nthe Pakistan/Afghan border, Tirich mir, at\n7708m, is the highest peak in the Hindu\nKush mountain range.\nLuckily for this expedition one day was\nenough to get the required documents upon\narriving in Pakistan. Some teams have been\nknown to be held up for up to 5 weeks. He\nsurvived a fire in a hotel in Islamabad and\nmanaged to bluff the local cricket fanatics -unluckily for Phil the greatest skill one needs\nto conquer Pakistan isn't mountain-craft, but\nknowledge of which woman Imran Khan\nmarried this summer!\nAfter staying in the servants quarters of a local palace for a while, the team managed to\nrecruit 50 local men - with knowledge of the\narea - as porters. Each porter, armed with\nnew sunglasses and a new pair of socks, was\nto carry 25 kilos each up to the area where\nBase Camp would be made. This was at a height of 4800m. To put that in perspective,\nthat is the height of Mont Blanc. Having\neverything they needed for 6 weeks in the\nmountains - including their very own local\ncook, Abdullah - the team proceeded to make\n1st,2 nd,3 rd and 4th camps at strategically\nplaced points up Tirich Mir.\nThrough radio contact the team were\nable to keep in touch with each other when in\nthe different camps, vital should someone get\nlost. Working together as a team, they\nmanaged to put 2 people on the summit quite\nsoon. Upon attempting the summit himself,\nwith fellow team member Gerry, Phil\nbecame very ill. They wisely decided, since\nhe had lost coordination almost totally, that it\nwould be safer to descend and so they\nreturned by skis to base camp. Phil had been\nsuffering from an onset of cerebral Oedema,\nsomething that is caused by altitude and can\nin extreme cases be fatal. Despite obviously\nbeing disappointed not to get to the summit\nhimself after being so close, Phil considered\nthe expedition a success.\nI hope that Phil's exploits inspire you to\ngo and do what you want to do. If you would\nlike more information then please come to\nthe next lecture. See you next Thursday in\nBiology W2 at 6.30 pm.\n\n"

    "content": "theatre:venice preserve eL n If there's one thing to be said about productions at the Almeida, it's that they always\nhave excellent sets. Before Venice Preserved\nstarts, the audience sit, rapped in shadows as the\ngentle lapping of the flooded streets provides the\nonly sound. As the lights slowly rise, always a magical moment in theatre land, a classically\ncolumned street rises into the distance forced to\na vanishing point under the rule of severe per-spec ti ve. Thankfrilly for your laterally thinking critic\nit's also a metaphor for the entire play, although\nsadly one better observed in optical than theatrical terms. For Venice Preserved is full of classical\ndilemmas; our hero is rejected should he seek\nrevenge?, our hero is put to the test, should he\ngive in?, our hero must choose been love and loyalty, life and death, cowardice and bravery, which\nway will he go?\nIt is therefore unfortunate that plot wise our hero (Jaffier) is a vacillating whiner whilst\nactor wise( David Bark-Jones), he is merely\nweak. Equally his wife Belvidera (Alice Krige)\nhas perhaps too delicate a balance to walk, slipping as she does from love struck infatuation to\ncolumn:simon baker\nApart from the shocking pictures of the\nGrim Reaper giving death a bad name by\ndestroying the poor old Watts Way traffic barr i er, the main preoccupation of the press of late is\nyour friend and mine, Michael Howard. The\nembattled Home Secretary got himself in a terrible mess over the prisons, the latest in a fairly\nlong line of gaffs. Now don't get me wrong, dear\nreader, I'm not against a bit of tough talking on\nthe law and order front. Like Tony Blair, I live on\nthe Thatcherite side of the political fence, and\nthink that the punishment should amount to\nsomething more than a quick slap on the wrist\nwith society blamed for the wrongdoing. But\nthere is something about Mr Howard that bothers me. It should be the cause of very great concern that Labour now appear to be trusted on\nLaw and Order more than the Conservatives,\nprobably for the first time ever. This used to be\nnatural territory for the Right, but by a series of\nclumsy, ill-conceived policies of late, public support has plummeted. Much as this pains me, and\ndespite a brilliant performance in a very tricky\ndebate in parliament, in which Jack Straw was\nabout as effective as Mr McGoo in an archery\ncompetition, I really feel that it is time he went.\nPerhaps now that Derrick Lewis is looking\nfor a new job, he might consider taking charge of\nthe Imperial College Union Council and\nExecutive Committee (or Head of Security?), in\nthe safe knowledge that even with him running\nthings, they could not possibly get any worse. I never fail to be amazed at the sheer incompetence and time wasting of these esteemed bod-ies. As soon as any decision seems to be made, a shrieking hallucination, to be the capstone on\nwhich the performance is built. Thankfully how-ever, it is possible to place such 'heroic' burdens\non one side and concentrate instead on the supporting players, for it is they who make the play.\nCentral, in both senses, is the figure of\nPierre (Ray Fearon). A hardy soldier and coup\nconspirator, it is Pierre who acts as devil, tempting Jaffier into the coup, before ending the play\nas a sacrifice offered for Jaffier's redemption.\nInterspersed between these affairs of state are\nthe scenes that work best, though add least to\nthe plot. Alphonsia Emmanuel's Aquilina, as\nwith all the characters, experiences the compromise of life; loving Pierre but 'playing around'\nwith one of the senators. And it is in the latter's grasp that the play really shines for a while, albeit\nas a comedy.\nWhich leaves your critic in a dilemma of his\nown. Venice Preserved proves itself to be an\nunwieldy beast. The basic material is a bit rough,\nand the cast, through strong, don't sparkle where\nthey should and the end scene is appallingly\ndirected. Yet for all that there are some extremely funny moments. Shame it's a classic tragedy\nthen.\nvote of no confidence or some bizarre procedural device is used to scupper it. We may be a science university, but we clearly have some bloody\ngood constitutional lawyers in training.\nThese silly antics do nobody any good. They\naccount for a lot of the apathy in college about\nthe Union and explain the stigma of being a Union hack'. Most people see a small group of\npeople playing politics for little discernible reason other than for their own enjoyment. We\nhave a Union Constitution that took almost as\nlong at the Maastrict Treaty to implement and\nseems to be as complex, resulting in every decision being queried as illegal and unconstitutional.\nSurely a set of clear guidelines by which to run\nthe Union shouldn't be that difficult to draw up\nand implement. For God's sake, this is ICU not\nICI. At the moment, we have an administration\nthat resembles the GLC at the height of its luna-cy. The other problem with the current state of\naffairs is that nothing ever seems to get done. I assume that, if the Council elections have to be\nre-run as a result of a vote of no confidence, precious little will get done before the end of\nNovember. The Union will have moved to\nSherfield before the first proper meeting gets\nunder way. A small consolation is that we are not\nmembers of the NUS. I dread to think what a mess we'd be in if we were.\nAnd finally (as a newsreader once said), I am\ntold that Brian May was back at the Union last\nWednesday. Obviously, years on the road with\none of the greatest bands ever have made him\ncareless and he didn't have a Union card on him.\nResult? Our man in yellow on the gate refused\nhim admission, of course. Surely someone could\nhave signed him in...\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 7 TH1995. THREE\nPill Scare Rocks Health Centre\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nDr. Irene Weinreb, Director\nof the Health Centre, has issued\na notice to Felix in response to\nthe recent publicity concerning\nthe risks associated with some\ncombined oral contraceptives.\nThe centre has been inundated\nwith calls since the disputed\nresearch findings were made\npublic last week.\nThe controversial brands are\nMercilon, Marvelon, Femodene,\nFemodene ED, Tri-Minulet,\nMinulet, and Triadene.\nStaff at the College Health\nCentre say they are not convinced of the increased risks\nassociated with the new progesterone s in these products (the\nstudies have not been published\nand reviewed yet). Dr. Weinreb\nexplains '...users are already\nscreened for risk factors before\nprescriptions are written, min-imi sing the effective risks'.\nThey stress that women should\nnot stop taking the pill and\nshould finish their current pack-et, however the centre is obliged\nto ask people who obtain their\npills from them to change to\nanother product.\nThose who get contraceptives elsewhere should discuss\ntheir situation with their GP or\nFamily Planning Clinic.\nThe Health Centre also\nissued guidelines advising their\npatients to take one of the following courses of action:\n\u2022 Collect a prescription for three\n_ months' supply of other brand\npills, plus an additional information sheet on how to change over.\nThen, within two months, make\nan appointment to see a doctor\nor nurse.\n\u2022 Make an appointment to see\none of the doctors or practice\nnurses.\n\u2022 Attend one of the doctors' or\nnurses' open clinics.\nThe Centre say they are\nhappy to answer enquiries, but\nask that they be made on weekdays between 12 and 12.30 or 3\nand 3.15pm. Oestrogen Pills and Thrombosis:\na Brief History\nIn the 1950'so estrogen was\nfound to inhibit ovulation when\ntaken in regular daily doses.\nOestrogen normally thickens the\nendometrium (uterus) wall and\nprevents other eggs from maturing while an egg is active.\nUnfortunately complications\nsuch as thrombosis sometimes\ndeveloped. Searches for safer\nalternatives led to various drugs\nwith low or no o estrogen con-tent. These were variably successful. The most promising work\nwas with progesterone. This hor-m one, which normally allows fertilised cells to multiply and grow\nin the uterus, was also found to\ninhibit ovulation, though less\nreliably than o estrogen. Current low dose oral contraceptives are based on mixtures and improvements of synthetic versions of these hor-m one s.An as yet un concluded European study seems to indicate that low dose oral contraceptives are still associated with\na small risk of thrombosis gene r ally.\nHowever third generation\nsynthetic progesterone s have\nbeen linked to higher incidence\nof th rom bobs is when they are\ncompared to previous generation\nprogesterone s such as levon g estro l. Research\nDisputed\nThe research findings that\nhave sparked off international\nalarm are still disputed. The as\nyet unpublished report from the\nWorld Health Organisation has\nfound that third generation synthetic progesterone s, deg estro l and ges to de ne, have been found\nto cause an increase of about\n0.0001% in incidents of (venous\nthr ombo embolism) blood clots\nin the leg and/or lungs.\nThe report was circulated to\nvarious governments around the\nworld. The U.K. Department of\nHealth, the first government\nbody to react to the report, sent\ndoctors a directive to deal with\nthe issue on Wednesday last. In\na separate development the\nGerman government announced\nthat they would be reviewing\ntheir position on the drugs this\nSunday night.\nThe project director of the\nWHO research stressed that\nthere was no need for the alarm\nthat had been generated. The\nrisk with these third generation\nprogesterone s is greater than previous ones, but the risk of blood\nclot formation is in actual fact\nvery small (0.0002%).\nThe WHO constitution\nrequires safety and choice to be\nparamount in fertility regulation,\nas for other aspects of human\nhealth. Other quarters take a different view, with the U.S. National Research Council calling on their government to relax\nregulations arguing \"Given the\npotentially serious health consequences of unwanted pregnancy\nresulting from contraceptive fail-ure, methods with fewer side\neffects are not necessarily safer if\nthey have higher failure rates\".\nDoctors, who have to implement these often conflicting\nprinciples in the real world, are\nleft to strike a balance between\nthe various risk factors and the\nneeds of their patients.\n\n"

    "content": "EIGHT . FELIX FRIDAY 2 7 TH OCTOBER 1 9 9 5 FEATURE\nIn a small theatre at Sadler's Wells, you can see the\nperfect dancer performing. He can execute any\ncombination of moves you ask him to, no matter\nhow complex or difficult. He can repeat them at any\nspeed, as many times as you like. He won't get tired\nor complain and he never makes even the slightest\nmistake. But the most extraordinary thing about this\nperformer is that he exists only in Cyberspace. He is\nthe 'digital dancer' and he is starting a revolution in\ndance and choreography.\nI went along to see him at the Digital Dance Project, part of\n'Dance Umbrella', Europe's leading dance festival. The project is being\nheld at the Lillian Baylis Theatre at Sadler's Wells all of this week and\naims to \"move dance-making out of the rehearsal studio and into the\nCyberStudio.\"\nWalking into the CyberStudio is a striking experience. An array of\nstage lights and video cameras are trained on a small black dance floor,\ncentre stage. Towards the\nrear there is a huge\nprojection screen showing\nvideo images of live dance.\nBut around the perimeter\nof the stage is something\nyou won't normally find in\na theatre: Several top of\nthe range Apple Macintosh\ncomputers, and seated at\nthem are some of Britain's most talented choreographers, digital artists,\nand multimedia designers.\nHenry Johnson, of\nIlluminations Interactive,\nexplained what was going\non.\n\"What we have here is\nfive teams of artists openly\ncollaborating with each\nother. They are using interactive software which combines video, live\ndance, animation and sound.\" The CyberStudio will be linked via the\ninternet to other Dance Umbrella sites around London and the public\ncan access and participate in this via a web site\n(http://www.ill um in. co.uk/uni brel la/). The web site will offer a showcase and a virtual workshop for the week's work, Johnson\ndescribes it as \"a window for the world to look over our shoulders and\na great opportunity for people to see artists as they create their work.\"\nMost of the artists in the CyberStudio are using Lifeforms, a piece\nof software containing a realistic model of the human body. When it\nwas developed in 1989 by engineers at Simon Eraser University in\nCalifornia, it allowed human figures on the screen to move from one\nset position to another, like a series of still photographs. Now, the\nlatest version moves with the fluidity of film and the digital dancer can\nbe viewed in three dimensions from any angle. One of the first people\nto use this software for choreography was Merce Cunningham,\ndescribed as the 'iconic grand master of American modern dance'. You\ncan see his work at two performances at Sadler's Wells this month.\nOne of the artists I encountered in the CyberStudio was Mark\nBaldwin, a leading British choreographer who uses Lifeforms to create\nhis own unique style of dance. Baldwin has in effect re-invented\nhimself as a digital choreographer. His dance company are currently\nperforming \"Dances from Cyberspace\" a selection of works created\nusing this new technology. I asked him how he had found the\ntransition.\n\"Anyone who has ever played a video game can use this\ntechnology\" he said, \"This also means that anyone can choreograph.\" I was surprised that somebody who was used to crafting his work on real\ndancers could take so easily to a keyboard, a mouse and 120MHz of\nMac power. Surely this must remove some of the creativity and\nemotion from his work?\n\"No, just the opposite. With Lifeforms you can change the speed\nor rhythm of the dancer without restriction. Its a visual thing. You try\nsomething, it may not work with real dancers as you envisaged but\nwhat you produce can suggest something else... The images and\nmovement have this\npower of suggestion.\"\nMoving on to the next\nwork station, I came\nacross Amos Winikoff, an\nartist who had trained as a software engineer but had\nrecently started working in\nperformance. His\napproach to using the\nsoftware was slightly\ndifferent: \" I like to\nchoreograph things as well\nas people. You can take all\nthe idiosyncrasies of the\ncomputer program and\nturn them into\nperformance. In this way,\nthe action never occurs on\nthe screen as you would\nsee it in real life.\" He then\nshowed me a sample of his work involving dance and juggling balls\nwhich was too fantastic to describe in mere words. For Amos, the end\nproduct is more than just people moving around, it can be composed\nof several sources: \"You couldn't possibly look at it all at once, so the\naudience has to make a choice... its not going to be just a dance.\"\nThe Digital Dance project is well worth checking out via the\nDance Umbrella web site (until mid-November) or if you want to go\nalong to see the setup for yourself, there are two seminars being held\nthis weekend at the Lillian Baylis Theatre. The first seminar is on\nFriday 27 Oct at 7.30pm and is a chance to explore the CyberStudio\nand raise issues of artistic vision in a live forum and debate. The second\nseminar is on Sunday 29 Oct 4.00pm. Chaired by Terry Braun, it will\ncover more practical issues concerning the support of similar projects\nin the future.\nMerce Cunningham's Dance Company: Sadler's Wells 28 & 29 Oct.\nMark Baldwin \"Dances from Cyberspace\" Riverside Studios Oct 31\n& Novl.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 2 7 TH OCTOBER 1 9 9 5 . SEVEN\nTHE LONDON The most\ndistinguishing\nfeature of the\nLondon Motor Show\nis its size. Not only\nis the venue huge,\nbut the number of\ncars on display gets\nlarger each year.\nFrom the smallest\nto the biggest, what\nyou want is there.\nTop: Lotus Elise, price approx. \u00a323,000\nAbove: Daewoo Nexia, price approx. \u00a39,000\nAbove Right: Alfa Spicier, price to be anounced.\nThe Earls Court site was roughly divided into 'cheap' and 'ex pen sive' exhibition areas. The many\nnew models on display include: the\nChrysler Jeep, Citroen's new Xantia\nEstate, Ferrari's F50, the Fiat Bravo,\nFord's Fiesta, Honda's Civic,\nHyundai's Lantra, the Land Rover\nDiscovery XS, Mercedes brand new\nE series, Peugot's806 and 406\nrange, Porsche's911, the advanced\nRover MGF, Vauxhall's new space-machine, the Vectra and the Volvo\n850 series.\nA particular coup for Saab this\nyear was their exhibit of the revolutionary 'sen sonic' gearing system.\nThis essentially is a manual transmission gear box which does away\nwith the need for a clutch. A very\npersonal decision as to whether you\nwant to use this bizarre system.\nNot only were the cars of inter-est, but the diverse marketing\nmethods employed by the various\nmanufacturers were also entertain-ing. If you're a fan of reworked 70's hits in the Gary Glitter style, you'd better mosey on over to the\nVauxhall stand. For the freebie fans,\nmany of the promo stalls were giving away free information packs,\nposters, bags and so forth.\nA few points of note:\nDaewoo claims to have shifted\n9,000 cars in six months and trumpets \"the most successful launch\never\". Further, on Wednesday, an\nanonymous buyer purchased a classic Jaguar D type for \u00a31 million.\nThere is a good selection of \"classic\"\ncars, and as increasing number of\nsports cars on show. Strangely\nenough, Volvo has joined the ranks\nof the sports models with the 850.\nIf you have a spare hundred thou' or\nso, don't waste it on a Mercedes\n600SL( \u00a3107,000), they're overpriced and rather vulgar. The 300\nseries however, is elegant and well\nworth a look.\nThe Motor Show continues\nuntil Sunday, but a full tour takes\nseveral hours to get the most of the\nhefty \u00a39 price tag (without concessions). Also, with the astronomical\nfood prices, this show is really only\nfor those who love cars (and tens of\nthousands of people).\nBy Jeremy Clarke\n\n"
