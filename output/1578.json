    "content": "Imperial College has taught how to live as a chaste monk\nEveryone on my snapchat gets my dictures!\nOnce, we made a laptop screen move back and forth in the room\nnext to ours in halls.\nI should probably become a lesbian\n\u201c\n\u201c\n\u201c \u201c\n\u201d\nForever alone computing student, forever a virgin. HELP ME FELIX!\n\u201c \u201d\n\u201d\n\u201d\n\u201d\nThe majority of students who took the\nsurvey (64.3%) lost their virginity before\ntheir 19th birthday, with only 14.6%\nstudents losing their virginity while\nstudents at College (i.e.\nhave joined in the last\nfour years and are\nbetween the ages of 18\nand 22). The most popular age for losing\none\u2019s virginity was 18, corresponding to the\nexperiences of 23.3% respondents.\n10.4% of students who took to survey are\nstill virgins, of whom 17% claim religion as a\nfactor in their virgin status. We asked Imperial\u2019s student virgins about the non-mutually\nexclusive factors that have kept their virginity intact and it transpired that 59.2% of\nvirgins haven\u2019t met the right person yet,\n15.8% are waiting for marriage, 14.5% are\napparently too busy\nbeing a World of\nWarcraft Guild Leader\n(Yes, you read that\ncorrectly), and 23.7% don\u2019t know why.\nFinally, in terms of virginity, of the virgins on\ncampus, 65.8% believe that one can still be\na virgin after giving/receiving a manual\nstimulation (read: a helping hand), while\nonly 14.47% believe the same applies after\nhypothetically giving or receiving oral sex.\nThis should be a quickie. We asked students if\nthey have ever had a one-night stand. Of the\nsurveyed population the\nanswers were relatively closely\nmatched, with 39.2% of\nrespondents being one-night\nstand virgins and 48.9%\nhaving taken part in an impromptu nocturnal\nliaison at least once.\nOf our one-night stand adventurers, women\ncounted for 36.5% of responses, while men\ncontributed 61.6%, but within their genders,\n50.6% of women had\nat least one\none-night stand\nclosely compared to\n47.8% of men.\nDuring the event itself women orgasm 15.8%\nof the time, a number outstriped by the male\nequivalent, a substantially larger 64.4%.\nOf those who took the survey, 19.2%\nof you took the bold step of asking\nyour partner for a\nthreesome, while\n31.1% claim to\nhave been asked.\nHowever, this makes dismal viewing\ncompared to the number who have\nsealed the deal, with only 12.7%\ntaking the tricycle belt of Barney\nStinson. The balance between\ngenders on\nthis topic is\nfairly even,\nwith 12.0% of\nfemale respondents saying that they\nhave engaged in a m\u00e9nage a trois,\ncompared against 11.3% of males.\nAs some of those who play in Sports teams\nmay say,\u201cWhat goes on tour stays on tour\u201d!\nAccording to our records, a surprising 1 in 5\n(22.2%) of Imperial students have cheated\non a partner.\nOut of those of you who fancy yourselves as\nsneaky in the realm of love\nas Mad Max of Eastenders\u2019\nfame, almost half (48.9%)\n(94) of you were found out,\nwith 75.5% of you confessing, 8.5% being\ncaught and 16.0% being rumbled by a third\nparty.\nWhen the shoe was on the other foot, 20.3%\nof students have admitted to being aware of\nthe fact that a partner has been unfaithful, of\nwhom 34.1% heard from somebody else\nwhile 45.9% were told by the partner in\nquestion.\nInterestingly, people who have been cheated on are twice as likely (37.6%) to cheat on\na partner than those\nwho havent (18.4%).\nFinally, looking at\nthe gender ratio,\n18.5% of men admitted to cheating on a\npartner, compared to 30.0% of women,\nalthough to be fair, at Imperial they have a\nwider, if not better selection to choose from,\ncomparatively.\nIt\u2019s back again, better, brighter and with more questions!\nWe\u2019ve managed to analyse the data from the 2014 sex survey\nand are happy to bring you the results in this 4 page\npullout.\nThis year 734 out of 9,915 students (undergraduate,\npostgraduate taught and postgraduate research combined) took\npart in the survey, representing 7.5% of the population.\nThis year\u2019s survey included a larger range of carefully thought out\nquestions that enabled us to ind out some more interesting\ninformation about the sex lives of students at College.\nWe hope you enjoy reading about what you and your\nclassmates get up to behind closed doors (or in some cases,\nout in the open!)\nIf we are simply just logging of to ind love,\nare we at least logging on\nto, well, get of? 29% of\nstudents apparently\nnever watch porn, 4% of\nstudents watch porn\nonce a week, around 20% of students watch\nporn 2 to 5 times a week, and 12% of\nstudents watch porn between 5 and 10 times\na week. That\u2019s at least once every\nweekday, and presuming they\nhave the weekend of to give their\nbandwidth a break.\nOut of those that didn\u2019t watch\nporn, 62% were women, and only 11% were\nmen.\nAre we using screens to show of our assets?\nA generous 32% of students do\u201csometimes\u201d\nsend explicit pictures to others, whilst a\nfurther 5% do so\u201cfrequently.\u201dHowever a\nresounding 63% seem to have a clean photo\ngallery, and have never\nsent any explicit\nphotos before.\nHowever, this wildly\nvaries when considering relationship status,\nalthough not as you might irst think. Out of\nthose who are seeing multiple people, 71%\nof them send explicit photos, whereas out of\nthose who consider themselves to be in an\nexclusive relationship, only 43% do so. It\nseems that dirty photos are either only used\nto attract attention and then are considered\ntoo time consuming for ongoing, steady\npartners, or sneaky snapchats are just driving\npotential bed mates away alto-gether.\nInterestingly 6.9% of respondents\nhave send pictures to people they\nhave never met, while 9.0% have sent sexts\nor explicit pictures to people other than a\npartner during a relationship, a result that\nmay prompt a few awkward conversations\nover the weekend.\n10.4%\n29%\n6.9%\n48.9%\n12.7%\n22.2%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nPhone\nBox\nStreet\nPark\nTrain\nTube\nBus\nNight\nBus\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nPhone\nBox\nStreet\nPark\nTrain\nTube\nBus\nNight\nBus\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nPhone\nBox\nStreet\nPark\nTrain\nTube\nBus\nNight\nBus\n\u201cHave you\never had\nsex in a\npublic\nplace?\u201d\nNumber\nof\nrespondents\n(#)\nI pulled on my first day at Imperial, turns out he was a druggy\nand was probably high at the time #peak\n\u201c\n\u201d\nDISCLAIMER\nThere are few caveats to recognise when analysing the Sex Survey data:\n1. The survey data may be biased by its very nature, for instance people who are not sexually active\nmay have felt discouraged from filling out the results, which may lead to an undestimation of some statistics (e.g.\nvirginity).\n2. The spread of responses varies by department, one department registered less than 10 respondents,\nwhile others counted over 100. This may skew data analysed on a departmental basis and makes some data\npoints unreliable.\n3. Some people may not have fully trusted the anonymity of the data and may have moderated answers\nto avoid embarrassment.\nContributions\nSurvey Design: Joe Letts, Matthew Allinson, George Butcher, Max Hunter, Jonny Pratt Survey Coding: Philip Kent Analysis: Joe Letts, Philippa\nSkett, Jonny Pratt, Cem Hurrell, Kunal Wagle Illustrations: Rosamund Pearce.\nThanks to everybody for all the time and effort they put into the survey, with a special mention going to Ros for hours spent in front of the iMac!\n\n"

For those that\ndo, it was a fairly equal split between\nthose that enjoy sharing and those that\nprefer to keep their toys to themselves.\n43% of students polled said that they\nused sex toys on both themselves and\ntheir partner, whist 38% of the total\nnumber of students who own sex toys\nsaid they simply kept their toys to them-selves.\nIt seems gender is a big\ninfluence in whether or not an\nImperial student agrees that\nsharing is caring. Out of the\nfemales that own sex toys,\n61% preferred to use their\ntoys solely for themselves,\nwhilst only 17% of males did the same.\nIt seems that we like our sex like we like\nour equations here at Imperial; uncompli-cated, simple to solve and with minimal\nvariables.

Meta materials are unique\nin having a negative refractive index.\nhe refractive index of a piece of\nglass is the Sine of the angle of a ray\nof light going into the glass divided by\nthe Sine of its angle going out, telling\nyou how much the glass bends light. A\nnegative refractive index is then a very\nstrange thing indeed, where the angle\nof incidence is greater than the angle\nof refraction, allowing light to be bent\nin very precise ways.\nIn the case of Pendry\u2019s invisibility\ncloak, light rays are bent around the\nmaterial, recombining when they\nleave as if they were travelling in a\nstraight line the whole time, leaving\nthe material invisible to a distant\nobserver.\nAnother Imperial physicist, Martin\nMcCall, extended this to the idea\nof a SpaceTime invisibility cloak,\nobscuring events. Unlike Pendry\u2019s,\nthis hasn\u2019t actually been made. he\nPendry cloak currently only works at\nmicrowave frequencies but work is\nunderway to extend it to visible light.\nSir Pendry is also known for his\ntheoretical work in predicting a\nperfect lens, which he demonstrated\nwith a 4 page paper in 2000. he paper\nwas so short that many refused to\nbelieve he could have demonstrated\nsuch a revolutionary idea, securing his\nplace as one of the greatest physicists\nin the country. He shares the prize\nwith two other scientists and will be\nawarded it at a special ceremony by\nthe king of Norway. Sir Keith O\u2019Nions\nlast week called Pendry \u201cone of the\ngreat Imperial scientists of all time\u201d.\nLondon commented: \u201cI am absolutely\ndelighted at this extremely generous\ndonation that will push forward\nresearch in an exciting and crucially\nimportant area of medical science.\nBiomedical engineering is improving\ntreatments and quality of life for\npeople a\ufb00ected by a diverse range\nof medical conditions and this new\ncentre has the potential to bene\ufb01t\nmillions in the UK and around the\nworld. his donation, coming so\nsoon after the launch of MedCity,\ndemonstrates unquestionably that\nLondon and the South East is one of\nthe leading regions in the world for\ngame-changing science.\u201d\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions, Rector of\nImperial College, sent an email to sta\ufb00\nat the College saying: \u201che Michael\nUren Biomedical Engineering Hub\nwill enable engineers and medics\nto come together and make new\ntechnologies, discoveries and\ninnovations on an unparalleled\nscale \u2013 cementing Imperial and the\nUK\u2019s position as world-leaders in\nbiomedical engineering.\u201d\nMichael said: \u201cWhat I \ufb01nd so\nexciting about this project is that here\nis Imperial building one of the biggest\nresearch centres in the world within\na few miles of the City of London,\nwhich itself has become the biggest\n\ufb01nancial centre in the world today. By\nputting the two together, what is quite\nclear is that the investment world will\nbe watching for, and waiting for, the\nresearch and inventions which will\ncreate tomorrow\u2019s great companies.\u201d\n\u201cImperial was inspirational when I\n\ufb01rst joined it as a young engineering\nstudent in 1940, when London was\nunder attack every night, and it is\ninspirational today.
