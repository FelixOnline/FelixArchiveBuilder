You\u2019ve seen all the posters in the tube \u2013 now go and see it!\nL\nee Miller \u2013 there never was,\nor has been since, anyone\nquite like her. Model-turned\nartist-turned-journalist, it\nappears as though she lived\nmultiple lives defined by the meander-ings of her artistic life. Like most great\nartists, it was not until long after her\ndeath that she gained praise and recog-nition. It was upon the publication of\nthe book, The Lives of Lee Miller (1985)\nwritten by her son Anthony Penrose,\nthat she came to the attention of a certain Jane Livingston who was carrying\nout research for exhibitions on surrealism and war-time art.\nThis year is a perfect year for the\nV&A to house a collection of her\nworks, commemorating both her 100th\nbirthday and also the 30th anniversary\nof her death. Her works are presented\nin chronology of the distinct segments\nof her life which also structured her\nwork; through this organisation we get\nto know Lee in an abstract way and see\nhow her experiences coloured what\nshe produced.\nBorn in Ploughkeepsie, New York,\nMiller was an only child and at the\nage of seven was raped and contracted gonorrhea. There is no doubt that\nthis tragic event had a great influence\non who she was and her strength in\nlater life, as well as, perhaps, helping\nto turn her into the surrealist that she\nbecame.\nAlready a professional when it came\nto being photographed (her father captured her in photos endlessly throughout her youth, often in the nude) she\nrose to being the most sought after\nmodel by 1926. The first set of photographs in the exhibition are those\ntaken by other notable photographers\nof the time and what strikes one first\nis her beauty \u2013 an archetypal woman\nof the twenties and thirties \u2013 and most\ncertainly on a par with Grace Kelly.\nHer coming-of-age as a photographer was aided by Man Ray. He was\nconsidered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century; he was\na Dada, Surrealist photographer and\npainter. She sought him out in Paris in\n1929, becoming his apprentice, muse\nand lover. Surrealism\u2019s true meaning\nshould be \u2018super-realism\u2019 \u2013 it has been\nmistranslated from the French, \u2018surr\u00e9alisme\u2019. So, with \u2018super-realism\u2019 and\nits plight to liberate the imagination\nand revolutionise human experience\nin its heyday, Miller was able to throw\nherself whole-heartedly into producing some of the highly interesting and\noriginal pieces seen on display.\nHer subject is nearly always captured\nclose up although subject matter, photographic finish, size and atmosphere\ncreated varies enormously. Due to her\nown experience as a model, portraiture\nwas an ideal pursuit for her as she was\nunafraid to bring the camera close to\nher subjects. People, street life, nature,\ninanimate objects and animals are all\ncaptured beautifully. One gets a taste\nof surrealism in the form of a severed\nbreast (from a radical mastectomy) on\na plate. Salvador Dali and his infamous\n\u2018belle Gala\u2019 are on display, as is her own\nself-portrait where we are reminded of\nher beauty as well as being introduced\nto her obvious talent as a photographer\nand artist.\nIn the next stage of her life, Lee Miller\nsojourned to New York in 1932, where\nshe kept up her modelling as well as\ncontinuing her photographic career.\nHere we see more emphasis on portraiture although none of her surrealist\nnature or variety of effects has evapo-rated. The grainy image of the blown\nup condom, resembling a glassmaker\u2019s\norb, with a hand through it, demonstrates just this, as well as the bizarre\nportrait of artist Joseph Cornell. Her\nadopted technique of solarisation,\nwhereby an image is wholly or partially\nreversed in tone, is put to use in many\ninstances. The solarised model piano\nis a fine example, with the tone of the\nwood resembling something closer\nto that of mercury. Another beautiful\nexample is the portrait of the English\n\u2013 born, German-famed actress Lillian\nHarvey, sporting a phenomenal dress.\nOne thing Miller manages to achieve\nin all her portraits, is to flatter the subject tremendously.\nOne of the highlights in the exhibition is her time in Egypt, which reignit-ed her passion for photography which\nhad dwindled in New York due to the\nconstraints she experienced in commercial photography. At this point,\nMiller was living the life of an Egyptian\nwoman, now betrothed to Aziz Elou\nBey. In these photos, one can see the\ndeparture from capturing people, and\nthe arrival at portraying what she saw\nin Egypt in a beautiful and very original way. What Miller does goes against\nwhat was, and still is, the clich\u00e9 way in\nwhich Egypt is perceived and captured\non film; panoramic, expansive views of\nmiles of desert, majestic pictures of the\nPyramids with the occasional camel\ntrain. Nature, earth forms, architec-ture, light and shadows are important\nhere. The Procession taken at the Red\nSea is a tiny beauty which displays\nforms in the sand. From the Top of the\nGreat Pyramid is the view directly under said structure, but with the pyramidal shadow perfectly portrayed.\nThe second delight is what Miller has\nbeen most famed for: her work for British Vogue during the war as a photo-essayist. Miller took many photographs\nin London and as well as in Germany,\nwhere she visited both ends of the\nspectrum; from Hitler\u2019s apartment to\nthe camps at Buchenwald and Dachau.\nAlthough several decades on from her\nforay in surrealist Paris with Man Ray,\nthe surrealist lived on in Miller during\nthese war days. The unexpected juxtapositions in her work reflects this. The\nphotographs of the SS guard dead in a\ncanal and the \u2018suicided\u2019 Bergermeister\ndaughter are as much fashion shoot as\nthey are horrific war time portrayals.\nOne can clearly see that Miller came\ninto her own during this period and\nreally honed her style which, up until\nthat point, had been a lot more haphazard and unpredictable.\nAs is often the case with war photographers who found themselves war\n\u2013 junkies by 1945, Lee Miller\u2019s interest\nin photography evaporated and was\nreplaced by an obsession with cooking,\nalcohol and depression. Her previous\nworks did not reach the fame they have\nnow, due to her lack of self-promotion\nand refusal to exhibit.\nNo one captures the essence of her\nlife better than her, describing it \u201clike\na water soaked jigsaw puzzle: drunken\nbits that don\u2019t match in shape or size.\u201d\nPerhaps this is the reason for being unable to attribute a genre to her work\ndue to her whimsical and unpredictable\nway of choosing subject matter. Miller\nobviously revelled in this freedom and\nbecame a sort of pioneer, unafraid to\ntake risks with what she captured. As\nwas the case in the first pieces in this\nexhibition, the last is a portrait of her\nby another \u2013 Picasso.\nHe succeeds in personifying her;\ncolourful, vibrant, abstract and ludicrously different to everything else in\nthe gallery!\nDing dong merrily on high,\nDo go along before it closes!\nDing dong merrily the sky...\nIt\u2019s only \u00a34.75 for a student ticket.\nLEE\nMILLER,\nSELF-PORTRAIT\nIN\nHEADBAND,\nPUBLISHED\n1933\n\u00a9\nLEE\nMILLER\nARCHIVES,\nENGLAND\n2007.\nALL\nRIGHTS\nRESERVED.\nDEAD SS GUARD IN THE CANAL, DACHAU, GERMANY, 1945\n\u00a9 LEE MILLER ARCHIVES, ENGLAND 2007.

    "content": "10 felix Friday 7 December 2007\neven with our sub-par organs, we can\nstill see comfortably.\nThe second argument states that\nsomething is false until proven true (or\nvice versa), and corroborated by the\nbig, impossible numbers of before. I\nwould like to perform an experiment:\ntake a pack of 52 cards, and shuffle it\nthoroughly. Look at the order the cards\nare now in. This is but one combination out of the 52! different ones that\ncould have arisen. If every person on\nearth shuffled and dealt a pack of cards\nevery second, you would be sure to get\nthe same combination only in an insanely huge amount of years. And yet,\nyou got that very specific order. Is that\nbecause god moved the cards for you?\nBecause your superior intelligence\ncompared to the dumb cards put them\nin a specific position? No. Simply, one\nof the combinations had to come out.\nSimilarly, life on earth was one of the\npossibilities: one of the many combinations of atoms and molecules in the\nprimordial ooze that, in the end, gave\nexistence to us. It could have been\nno life at all, it could have been completely different from what we know\nnow. An example was that the chance\nof a specific 500-aminoacid protein to\ncome into existence from a soup of all\namino acids in equal proportions is so\ntiny it could never arise spontaneously.\nFirst of all, any biologist will tell you\nthan not all of those 500 amino acids\nare fundamental: some make the important bit (functional group) and the\nrest is merely ballast, which can be any\namino acid in any order, since it is irrelevant to the function of the protein\nitself. Second, what would be the big\ndeal if the important amino acids were\ndifferent? Okay, there is a big chance it\nwouldn\u2019t work, but also that it would\nwork just as well, or better, or worse.\nAgain, creationists seem to think that\nour very specific life requirements are\nthe only ones possible. It is out of their\ngrasp that there are intermediates between our life and no life at all, and\neven possibilities that could actually be\nbetter.\nIn conclusion, the lecture was bad,\nthe arguments worse and the justification for them atrocious. I\u2019ve tried\nto look at them here, but I have still\nskipped such spurious claims as \u201cthere\nare no intermediate fossils that show\nthe evolution of a species\u201d (just look\nat the horse\u2019s evolutionary history),\n\u201clife only arises from life\u201d (Miller\u2019s experiment then is just false, I presume),\n\u201cAustralopithecus was an ape\u201d (first of\nall, the Australopithecus was a genus,\nnot a species, and second of all, no),\n\u201cit is not possible to recreate soft tissue from bones\u201d (forensic facial recon-struction. Look it up on Wikipedia)\nand others I can\u2019t remember, due to\ntheir sheer volume. It saddens me to\nsee people who uphold arguments like\nthese and judge the inevitably wrong\nconsequences as true.\nBut, alas, not all is lost. If nothing\nelse, it has proven to me that people\nwho do seek the truth exist, and that\nthey are vocal and passionate about\nthis issue. Roars at irrationality, laughter at ridiculousness and coldness at\nnonsense greeted the speaker throughout the speech. The sensible, logical\npeople outnumbered and outweighed\ntheir opponents, and showed how such\nidiocy is not appreciated here. Despite\nclaims to the contrary, creationism is\ndeclining, and today\u2019s audience was\nthe living proof. Let\u2019s keep it up.\n\u201cCreationism\nis declining;\ntoday\u2019s audience\nwas living proof.\nKeep it up\u201d\nAtlas of Creation: the true meaning\nAzfarul Islam cuts a swathe through the meandering and experiences something quite astounding\nA\nccusing Charles Darwin of being somehow\nintrinsically linked to\nmultiple counts of fas-cism, communism, racism and genocide could only be, at the\nvery least, an interesting way to commence the major tenor of the \u201cAtlas of\nCreation\u201d.\nIt was an hour filled with fervent\ncensure of Darwin\u2019s famous (or infa-mous, depending upon your perspec-tive) \u201ctheory\u201d of evolution, unveiled\nmutterings against propaganda and\nuncomfortable finger-pointing all interspersed with quotes from the Holy\nQur\u2019an. That in itself was a cocktail\nfor fostering controversy and discord.\nAnyone watching the audience can\neasily attest to this as applause broke\nout relevant to the points being ar-gued. A clear schism was formed \u2013 dividing the audience into believers and\nnon-believers - but this wasn\u2019t due to\nignorance or the talk itself. The rather\nself-aware speaker Dr Babuna seemed\nto forget where he was delivering his\nspeech; he was hardly converting anyone that day. Rather, his bombastic\nand often parochial statements would\nonly widen the gap and reinforce past\nprejudices and the ironclad faiths that\nmaterialise in such debates. Interestingly, despite quoting verses from the\nHoly Qur\u2019an, the religious undertones\nwere merely that. There seemed to be\nno ulterior motive other than his own\nobdurate opinion as it collided with\nthe cool, agnostic logic of science.\nAs the seminar continued, one thing\nseemed to be evident: this man had a\ndream and he didn\u2019t want to share it.\nHe wished to establish it as de rigueur.\nIn tandem, his examples further relied\nupon the juxtaposition of arbitrarily \u201clarge\u201d magnitudes to express the\nimprobability of random chance. And\neventually, the age-old argument was\naroused anew. Does the human truly\ndescend from the simian?\nAs a Muslim, I was taught otherwise\nand, as part of my faith, I maintain\nsuch knowledge as a personal truth.\nHowever, I was also raised to keep an\nopen mind and after shaking my head\nconstantly during the higher crescendos of his messages, I shifted gears\ninto a neutral drive. And then, I saw it.\nThere was clearly more to this man\u2019s\ninanities. There were certain strings\namidst this admittedly messy presentation that would wind with each other\nto coalesce into something far greater,\nsomething truly holistic.\nIt was during the finale that this\nhand was revealed. Hidden behind a\nbrusquely arrogant personal agenda\nthere was a delicate transmutation\ninto a wholesome message of secularism and tolerance. This was clearly\nevident when people left the Clore\nlecture theatre at least two hours after the man\u2019s conclusion. During that\ntime, the entire theatre had turned into\na primordial soup of new, exciting and\npersonal discussions. It\u2019s not difficult\nto imagine that each person\u2019s contribution to the several peer groups would\nfoster further awareness and thought.\nTo me that was what made the event\nspecial; almost transcendental, if you\nwill. Despite being subject to what\nmany would call bigoted foolishness,\nthere was a seed planted. This was\nthe kind of seed that rarely exists in\nour age of impuissant acceptance and\nschematised information; the kind\nthat inspired scientists of old. It was\nthe seed of thought, and of intelligent\nquestioning.\nThe phrase \u201cAtlas of Creation\u201d seems\nto have been chosen with a lot more\nprescience than was initially apparent.\nThe ever-recurring face of Darwinism? Or is it merely simple fascism Apparently Mao\u2019s groundwork for China had some base in Darwinism\nClaim to fame: doesn\u2019t believe in God, so he wrote a book about that\nAtlas, tolerance incarnate, has a lesson or two to teach us all\n\n"

The marquee, which has been up\nfor over half a year, will finally have to be taken down much to the\njoy of students. Rumours that a bog-monster will emerge from the\nmuddy undergrowth are completely unfounded.\nCreationism on Campus\nAhlul-Bayt society invited Dr. Babuna, representing Harun\nYahya, to speak on the evils of Darwinism and Atheism\nThe poster for the event hosted in the Huxley building by Ahlul-Bayt\nMatty Hoban\nOn Monday 3rd December at 6pm\nin the Clore Lecture Theatre, Huxley\nBuilding, the Imperial College Islamic\nAhlul-Bayt society invited a speaker\nfrom the Harun Yahya organisation to\ntalk about Darwinism. The event was\norganised with the aim of encouraging\ndebate and discussion between those\nwith differing points-of-view on the\nEvolution vs. Intelligent Design/Creationism debate.\nThe keynote speaker was a Dr Cevat\nBabuna, a Turkish neurosurgeon and\ndevout Muslim. He spoke for over an\nhour on the supposed evils and errors\nof Darwinism before a questions and\nanswers session with the speaker took\nplace; this excited many into a fevered\ndiscussion. Even after the questions\nand answers session, many remained\nto discuss what had taken place.\nThe event was well attended by those\nof differing faiths and those with differing opinions on the matters of crea-tion, which could be seen and heard in\nthe various reactions to the lecture and\ndebate afterwards.\nDr Babuna\u2019s lecture began by discussing the evils of Social Darwinism\nand linking Fascism, Nazism and Communism directly to the supposed \u2018law\nof the nature\u2019 that Darwin \u201cpreached\u201d.\nMany seemed outraged at these re-marks, with the point made later that\nanti-Semitism and Atheism existed\nlong before the publication of On\nNatural Selection. It was clear from the\noutset that Dr Babuna wanted to provoke a reaction, and he was successful.\nAfter discussing the negative effects\nof Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution on the\nsocial sciences (which did exist, despite\nDarwin\u2019s protestation), more traditional grounds for opposing Darwinism\nwere then explored, beginning with the\nargument of irreducible complexity;\nwhere in an organ such as the eye, if a\npiece is removed it apparently cannot\nfunction, claimed Dr Babuna. Since the\nTheory of Evolution describes more\ncomplex organs evolving from simpler\norgans, irreducible complexity is an argument against Evolution; this was one\nof the many arguments utilised to oppose Darwinism.\nWhat made the lecture more interesting is that it was a Muslim speaking\nas opposed to an Evangelical Christian\nwho are traditionally associated with\nthe Intelligent Design cause. Because\nof this, more debate was opened between differing creeds, whether they\nagreed with Dr Babuna or not and\nthis produced a thought-provoking\nevening. Whilst many were worried at\nthe fact that such views were expressed\nat a science university, any worries that\nstudents (both religious and non-reli-gious alike) shared were quashed in the\naggressive questions asked in the session following the lecture.\nAfter the questions and answers ses-sion, the air was cooled by the showing\nof a video depicting suffering children\nin Iraq; as the chair of Ahlul-Bayt offered that despite differing views, everyone is united behind humanitarian\ncauses. Despite the nature of debate,\nwe are all still human.\nFor opinion on the lecture and the\ntopics discussed, head to pages 8\nto 10 for in depth analyses from\ntwo people who also attended\n\n"

    "content": "20 felix Friday 7 December 2007\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nLondon gets the leftovers again\nEmily Wilson strikes again. This time, she tears apart the Turner Prize: Retrospective exhibition at the Tate\nBritain. The curating was rubbish, but the art wasn\u2019t too bad. (Those pictures are making me hungry)\nT\nhe notorious Turner Prize\nis awarded annually to a\nyoung British conceptual\nartist by the Tate Gallery.\nEvery year the shortlisted\nartists\u2019 work are shown in Tate Britain,\nthe exception to the rule, of course, being this year. This year the Turner Prize\nhas been shipped off to Tate Liverpool,\nsince Liverpool is the so-called \u201cEuropean Capital of Culture\u201d for 2008. So\nwhy is the 2007 Turner Prize in Liverpool and not the 2008 Turner Prize?\nGod only knows. But to make up for\nthe London absence of Turner Prizeosity, the good people at Tate offer us\nTurner Prize: A Retrospective. This is\nan exciting opportunity to see some of\nthe works that have earned their artists the Turner Prize in previous years.\nHurrah!\nI will tell you right now that you need\nto have some background knowledge\nof the Turner Prize before you walk\nthrough the door, because Tate Britain\nisn\u2019t going to help you. Once you\u2019ve\nforked out \u00a36 to get into the exhibi-tion, you\u2019re given an awkwardly-sized\nnewspaper guide. This isn\u2019t much help,\nI\u2019m afraid. There\u2019s no explanation of\nhow the prize is judged and awarded.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was half-way round the\nexhibition that I grasped the Turner\nPrize is awarded to an artist and not\ntheir art specifically. I had expected a\nsimple gallery of paintings and sculptures that won the prize, but actually\nit\u2019s just a messy selection of art by the\nartists that won, and some of the artists\nthat didn\u2019t win. This confused me as\nwell \u2013 there is little differentiation between who won and who didn\u2019t, unless\nyou pay close attention to the labels and\nyour bundled up fist of newspaper.\nThe layout of the exhibition doesn\u2019t\nhelp. The first room is the worst, causing you to start your visit in a state\nof total bafflement. It\u2019s arranged in\nchronological order, but only if you\npsychically know which way to walk\naround each room. The most infuriating thing to me was how there is one\nlabel per artist, not one label per piece\nof art. So if one artist has two pieces\ndisplayed, you have to trudge back\nand forth across the room to compare\neach piece to its description. \u201cFor those\nwho have ears #2\u201d is a lovely, looping,\nwooden structure in the first room that\nreminds me of M\u00f6bius strips, but you\ncan\u2019t find out who made it or what it\u2019s\ncalled unless you realise it\u2019s paired with\na less attractive steel structure 25m\naway, where the label is. Then once\nyou\u2019ve found this elusive label, you still\nhave little idea whether the piece\u2019s artist won the prize or was just nominat-ed. This constant game of matching the\nart to the artist to the year significantly\nruined my enjoyment of the visit.\nTurner Prize art is all controversial\nstuff. The little old ladies you walk past\nin the Millais exhibition downstairs\nare absent, presumably scared away by\nthe sex and guts. In fact the main client\u00e8le was the sixth-form art student,\narmed with sketchbook, whinging \u201ccan\nwe go shopping now?\u201d. To ward off any\nold dears who wandered in by mis-take, there\u2019s a monumentally massive\nGilbert and George that smacks you\nin the face right at the beginning. The\ntwo tweed-clad fellows, who won in\n1986, are flying about in garish colour\nwith their leather-clad East London\ngay youth chums in \u201cDrunk with God\u201d\n(1983). There are some big sexy flowers mixed in there, in case you didn\u2019t\nquite get the subtlety of all the rampant\nhomoeroticism.\nAnish Kapoor won in 1990, and his\ncontribution to the exhibition was\n\u201cUntitled 1990\u201d \u2013 three deep-blue,\nhollow half-spheres that take up an entire room. Staring into them gives you\na spectacular sense of infinity- before\nmaking your eyes go funny. Art gallery\netiquette prevents you yelling at them,\nbut I\u2019m fairly sure they\u2019d produce a\nvery satisfying booming echo.\nI\u2019m less impressed by the adjacent\ncontribution by Antony Gormley,\nwho won in 1994. He did so by taking\na cast of his body in a bent-over posi-tion, then sticking five copies about\nthe room in what seem like random\nplaces but is probably an exploration of\nshape, angle and space. My borderline-offensive newspaper guide informs me\nhis main subject matter was the violent\nconflict in his native Northern Ireland,\nwhich I imagine is why they gave him\nthe prize. The question I\u2019m asking: did\nhe manipulate the castings to make his\npenis bigger? If you\u2019re interested in the\nmysterious matter of how they recreate the spacing and angling of modern sculpture every time they move\nit, I refer you to \u201cSharp\u201d by Grenville\nDavey. These four pieces of shaped,\ncream-coloured steel are reconfigured\nevery time the sculpture appears in a\nnew gallery, to best suit the room it is\nplaced in.\nAnd now we get to the artist everybody came for: Damien Hirst. Yes,\nhis formaldehyde half-cows are there.\n\u201cMother and Child Divided\u201d (1993) is\nfascinating to look at, from an anatomical perspective. You can pick out all the\ndifferent cuts of beef available, including a really juicy looking rump steak.\nI really don\u2019t find any of it disgusting\n\u2013 it\u2019s like being back in a school biology classroom, looking at the shelves\nof tapeworms and dissected rats in\njars. But then I am a biologist. I\u2019d like\nto point out to you that the cows exhibited today are only modern copies\nof the 1993 originals, just to disappoint\nyou in advance. Also present is Hirst\u2019s\n\u201cArginosuccinic Acid\u201d (1995). Hirst\u2019s\nsheets of coloured dots are a particular favourite of mine. But bear in mind\nthat he didn\u2019t even colour in dots himself \u2013 he had slavey artistic assistants to\ndo it for him, including Lauren Child,\nauthor and illustrator of \u201cCharlie and\nLola\u201d, and the \u201cClarice Bean\u201d series.\nI find it quite interesting that often\na Turner artist can offer two very different pieces of art. Damien Hirst has\nhis cross-section ruminants and his\ncoloured dots. Rachel Whitbread offers \u201cUntitled (floor)\u201d (1994-5) which is\nan ugly block of nothing-in-particular\non the floor, but also \u201cHouse\u201d (1993),\nwhich is a series of quite pleasing black\nand white photographs of a very impressive casting of an old terraced\nhouse.\nI\u2019m not into those little arty films\nthey show in darkened cupboards, so\nI won\u2019t dwell on those. But I will mention \u201c60 minute silence\u201d (1996) by Gillian Wearing. This is a film of a group\nof policemen being made to sit in total silence for 60 minutes. Obviously I\ndidn\u2019t stick around to witness the whole\nfilm, but apparently it all climaxes in a\nsudden cry of relief at the end.\nI did like the room full of photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans, who\nwon in 2000. They include a man having a conversation with a deer, a win-dow-box garden, people traveling on\nthe tube, and a squirting nipple. In the\nnext room, I found it quite it quite difficult to make notes of Martin Creed\u2019s\n\u201cWork no. 227: lights going on and off\u201d\nbecause the lights kept going on and\noff.\nThere are a few mentionables in the\nfinal room. Keith Tyson\u2019s studio wall\ndrawings are like a visualisation of a\ntrain of thought, scrawled and doodled and filled with colour. You get the\nimpression that while he\u2019s a talented\nBritish artist, he\u2019s also just some guy\nmessing about and enjoying himself.\nGrayson Perry\u2019s earthenware pots are\nbeautiful \u2013 if they were sold in shops,\nI\u2019d buy one. I\u2019m somewhat disconcerted by the fact that one has my Dad\u2019s\nname written on it in red, but since\nthere are many other names, including\nAlan Yentob, it probably isn\u2019t anything\nto get paranoid about.\nTo conclude, I think the Tate could\nhave put a bit more effort into this one,\nparticularly if they\u2019re charging students a whopping \u00a36 to see it. The art\nranges from the appalling crap, to the\nmoderately pleasing, to the excellently\ndelightful, but the organisation and labelling is dire. Give me a forklift truck,\nWikipedia and a spare afternoon and I\nprobably could have done a better job.\nIn fact, if you do go, ignore the idiotic\narrangement as well as all the blurb\nand just wander round looking at the\nart, which I don\u2019t think this exhibition\nhas done justice.\nI\u2019m hungry. Anyone for steak?\nThe exhibition ends on January\n6th! Schoot! Get yourself down\nthere ASAP\n.\nThe writers at Felix decide to give Yoga a go... what they didn\u2019t realise was that they had come on the night of the \u2018Fans of Right Angles\u2019 class\nWould you like your steak with peppercorn sauce or formaldehyde, sir?\n\u00a9 DAMIEN HURST \u201cMOTHER AND CHILD DIVIDED\u201d\n\u00a9 ANTONY GORMLEY\n\n"

She was in\nSudan, and, well, allowed a teddy bear in\nher class to be named\nafter a pupil, and now she\u2019s locked\nup with a crowd outside baying for\nblood!\u201d\n\u201cWhoa man, that\u2019s unreal. Hey,\ndo you wanna see some cool Danish\ndrawings?\u201d\nI admit, I almost laughed when the\nstory first broke. After checking the\ncalender for April Fool\u2019s, and staying\nsober for 24 hours before rereading\nthe story, it finally sunk in that yes, an\nEnglish teacher faced 40 lashings and\n90 days behind bars for allowing her\nclass to call a teddy bear Muhammed.\nCharged with insulting Islam and the\nProphet, Gillian Gibbons now faces a\njail term in a concealed location for her\nown safety.\nThat such a tiny, minuscule thing can\nget blown up to such proportions beggars belief. Manic crowds demanded\nher execution by firing squad. Government officials wanted a personal apology from Gordon Brown. Many linked\nher \u2018blasphemy\u2019 with a Western plot to\noverthrow the countries of Islam, one\nfluffy bear at a time. Reminders of last\nyear\u2019s cartoon scandal circled the internet feeding frenzy, woven together\nwith references to the Satanic Verses,\nIsraeli secret services and a fuzzy picture of a one-armed man entering a\nLondon subway.\nFor although the insanity in Sudan\nmay seem to be on a different planet,\nthere are some uncomfortable home\ntruths about Islam in Britain today. A\nsurvey back in 2005 showed that the\nmajority of British Muslims were in favour of introducing Sharia law (the one\nwhere atheism is a capital offence). Let\nus not forget that a court in Saudi Arabia recently sentenced a woman to be\nlashed. She had been beaten and raped\nby a gang of 7 men. Her crime? Sitting\nwith a man, not related to her, in a car.\nMore alarming still are the 65% of\nMuslims who believe that the 7/7\nbombings in London were faked, set\nup by MI5 and framing innocent, law-abiding students of Islam as the perpe-trators. This dangerous myth is based\non a grainy CCTV picture of one of the\nbombers with his left arm behind his\nrucksack. Of course, the fact that the\npicture appeared on the net several\ndays after the event, during which time\nanybody could have edited certain\nfeatures, barely dents the conspiracy\ntheorists. Similarly, the argument that\nthe most sophisticated cover-up in history was exposed by one missing limb\non a grainy picture falls flat on its face,\nespecially in the light of the security\nservices\u2019 blunders with terrorist suspects and Iraq\u2019s \u201c15-minute WMD\u2019s\u201d.\nAlthough it is easier to get carried\naway in such charged debates, there\nare fortunately those who stand up for\nIslam for the peaceful philosophy it is\nmeant to be. The reaction of the Muslim Council of Britain over the teddy\nbear rage has been positive, backing\nMrs Gibbons and campaigning for\na pardon. Also, despite the protests\naround the country, many Sudanese\nare sympathetic and even supportive\nof a teacher who desired to help children in an economically ravaged country gain a footing in life. We ourselves\ncannot let the incident fuel the fires\nof Islamophobia, nor further provoke\nextremism. The Islamic students of\nImperial should stand together with\nthe whole college to promote tolerance\nand understanding, both on campus\nand in all countries of the world.\nScorpio\nPakistan, forever without God\nOmar Hashmi\nW\nhat failures we have\nbecome. What a\nshame to cast over\nour sullen faces.\nPakistan has now\nthe most insulting of honours. She\nis the first nation in modern history\nwhere a leader has performed not one,\nbut two coups to stay in power. Astonishingly, the second one was against his\nown government, judicial courts and\nthe very systems he helped set up for\nthe last eight years. All just to grapple\non to power. Suicide? President Pervez\nMusharraf was not saving Pakistan\nfrom suicide, he has been helping it\nalong. He has schemed and overpowered his way to become America\u2019s only\nGodchild in the region.\nSuicide? Pakistan has been killing\nitself since its very inception. It used\nto be the case that we saw new faces,\nbut the same old corruption. Now it is\nthe same faces and the same corrup-tion! The fascist BNP alliance (by that I\nmean Benezir Butto, Nawaz Sharif and\nPervez Musharraf, my God, even Nick\nGriffin as President is a Godsend compared to that lot) have bled the country\ndry. All of us hate all of them. Any remnant of loyalty comes from the corrupt\nbank role or the backward ties of tribal\nnepotism.\nBhutto looks half as young as the\nQueen, but has estimated assets of\n1.5 billion dollars of Pakistan\u2019s money.\nThat is the Muslim Ummah\u2019s (nation)\nlaundered money - double the Queen\u2019s\nriches stolen. Corrupt Nawaz not only\nseverely weakened the national mili-tary, but sold off large amounts of the\nnation\u2019s assets to foreign companies.\nWhile the fat cats fattened, the poor\ncould not even afford a staple diet, nor\nget access to clean water and energy.\nAll of them have raised the amount of\ninterest re-payments to the IMF and\nWorld Bank, yet in Islam Mohammed\n(pbuh) said that this was tantamount\nto war with Allah! Fitting, then, for all\nof the leaders have pledged to fight the\nWar on Terror harder \u2013 it seems they\nall enjoy the needless spilling of Muslim blood in this American crusade to\nshove a foreign Western mind-set and\ngovernment down the throats of Muslim countries. Ahem, sorry, I meant\nLiberal Interventionism.\nI do not blame these leaders. I blame\nthe system. Democracy in Pakistan is\nthe system that has allowed us to throw\nthe Qur\u2019an behind our backs and legislate according to whatever we feel. Our\nleaders hold no Islamic policies. They\nonly wish to sell out to foreign invest-ment, drown in forbidden interest,\nsell the country\u2019s military and nuclear\nindependence and stand by at the killing of fellow Muslim nations, all in the\nname of \u201cmodernism\u201d and globalisa-tion. Nay, this is not progressive, it is\ntantamount to treason.\nIt is time for change! It is time to\nbring God, the Qur\u2019an and the masses\nback into the running of a once great\npart of the Nation. Yes, part. For Pakistan is not a nation, it is a Wilayat \u2013 a\nstate within a Country. From Indonesia to Spain there was once a unified\ngovernment, before the modern Western powers artificially divided it. The\nchant was not Freedom or Liberty, it\nwas something far better and more accepted by the people \u2013 La illa ha Ill Allah Mohammedan Rasul Allah \u2013 There\nis nothing worthy of worship but Allah\nand Mohammed (pbuh) is his Final\nMessenger.\nIf there is a God, does it not seem\nstrange that he would not tell us who\nhe is and how to live our lives? He did!\nAnd the Khilafah system, Islamic Law,\nwas how he told us to run a government and society. When implemented,\nthis ruling system was the most just. It\nhad a religiously obligatory independent judiciary of Islamic scholars. An\nobligation of Shura (consultation of\nthe elected leaders of the people) and a\nKhaleef \u2013 a leader bound at the neck by\nthe rules of Islam that he must follow.\nThe poor had a fair distribution of re-sources, religious minorities were pro-tected, and the safety of the people was\nparamount. Then this system decayed\nand we found injustices everywhere.\nThen it was broken.\nNow we have Godless corruption,\ntyranny, dictators, thieves, murderers\nand hypocrites! No wonder Pakistani\nsoldiers raped and killed Bangladeshi\nMuslims in the Bangladesh Liberation\nWar. What dogs we have become! In\nPakistan, a petty thief is brutally pun-ished, but the greatest ones hold the\ncountry to ransom.\nNo more! I cannot stand by without\nshouting from the hilltops. The obligation is clear!\nFor a country that so proudly boasts\nof its Islam, now is the time to implement it! An Islamic government for\nPakistan, a unified Islamic government\nfor all the Muslim nations! This is the\nonly way to secure the running of the\ncountry. In a land where nobody can\neven queue, it is the Adhan (Islamic\ncall to prayer) that calls entire society\nto stand in rows.\nEach and every Muslim, if he cares\nabout his people, must raise the call\nfor this goal. It is a religious obligation\nto believe in Allah, to obey him, and to\nrule by what he has revealed. Each and\nevery Muslim at Imperial must rally to\nthis call. It is a religious obligation! And\nif those in the West want to see how\na country should really be run, then\nopen your eyes, ears and hearts. Talk\nto us, allow us to show you, and we will\ngladly and warmly calm your unjustified fears and apprehensions. God will-ing, you will find how just and liberating a true Islamic system can be.\n\u201c\nNow we\nhave Godless\ncorruption,\ntyranny,\ndictators,\nthieves,\nmurderers and\nhypocrites.\nWhat dogs\nwe have\nbecome!\nBush and Musharraf: America\u2019s only godchild in the region.\nIslamic nation: Best way forward for Pakistan\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\n\n"

Felix Sport is here to\ncover all aspects of Imperial sports, so\nmedics, don\u2019t complain that Felix is being biased towards IC when you don\u2019t\nwrite in (the rugby club is the exception as they actually have been submitting reports!).\nFrom next term, I will increase the\nsize of the league table to encompass\nthe medics, so that we can truly see\nwhich teams are the best in college.

Almost\nall of Imperial College\u2019s rowers raced\nover the course of two days, once again\nshowing rowing to be arguably Imperial\u2019s most successful sport.\nSaturday brought an historic win for\nIC sculler George Whittaker in the\n\u2018Sculler\u2019s Head\u2019 against over 400 other\ncompetitors, including many of Britain\u2019s top scullers. The Sculler\u2019s Head\nis raced on the Thames from Chiswick\nto Putney Bridge and is one of the premier events on the rowing calendar\n\u2013 a win in such a high quality event\nis a tremendous achievement. Strong\nperformances were also recorded by\nseveral other IC scullers, with Sam\nHutchinson and Piers Barnes in par-ticular, placing highly. On the same\nday, a large number of the senior squad\ntravelled to Nottingham to race in the\nBUSA Small Boats Head. Universities\nIain Palmer from around the country competed,\nand IC stamped its mark on the event\nwith a stronger performance than all\nother universities in attendance. Medals were obtained in almost all events\nentered, with gold being won in 5 of\nthe 12 events; the double, lightweight\ndouble, lightweight single, women\u2019s\nlightweight pair and the coxless four.\nCrucially, all-important (in the eyes\nof Sport Imperial) BUSA points were\nobtained. Prior to Saturday, Imperial\nCollege (as a whole) had obtained 5\npoints; the achievements of the boat\nclub added 92 points to this total.

For its detractors it was\nlegitimising the views of two dangerous\nmen, capable of causing great damage\nin the minds of the public.\nBoth arguments are, of course, lu-dicrous. Worse, the actual question\nof freedom of speech was completely\nignored. The Oxford Union was not\nchampioning freedom of speech or\neven trying to have an informed debate on it; it was purposefully courting\ncontroversy for publicity\u2019s sake. While\nboth men have endured attempts by\nothers to limit their freedom of expres-sion, this does not make them experts\non the topic any more than OJ Simpson is an expert on the American judicial system.\nFurthermore, freedom of speech is\ndistinct from provision of platform\nand so the very invitation itself was\nnot really an ideological promotion of\nthe cause at all. Just because we accept these men\u2019s right to say what they\nwant does not mean we have to listen\nor hand them a megaphone. The pro-testers, on the other hand mistook an\ninvitation to speak at a forum for an\nendorsement, reasoning that a sensible\nperson, who previously found racism\nand anti-Semitism repugnant, would\nbe converted to a St. George\u2019s flag-waving skinhead because the Oxford\nUnion invited a couple of old bigots\nto an event where they were basically\nsubjected to being called moronic by\nkids a fraction of their age. Rather,\nthe most effective promotion for their\nviews came on the night when a mod-ern-day lynch mob of Oxford students\ncalled for the death \u2013 I kid you not,\ndeath \u2013 of the head of the Oxford Union. By comparison, Griffin and Irvin\ncould not help but look like a pair of\nreasonable chaps.\nThis was all very entertaining but\nactual questions about an individual\u2019s\nfreedom to let their views be known\nwithout fear of repercussion were\nneither asked nor answered. We live\nin a country where people can still be\nprosecuted for certain views and ut-terances, and as a libertarian I find this\nworthy, perhaps, of at least a little bit of\nDavid Irving, the historian who questions the facts of the Holocaust in Germany, was invited to speak at the\nOxford Union\nKadhim Shubber\npublic discourse. Within Britain you\nare allowed to speak your mind provided you are not saying certain things;\ninciting certain types of hatred (some\nforms of \u201chatred\u201d are more acceptable\nthan others, you see), defamation and\n\u201cencouragement of terrorism\u201d are a\nfew. Of course, some limitations will\nalways be necessary to keep order, the\nKadhim on Gillian Gibbons and that teddy\nIt seems that wherever I look, I cannot\nescape conflict between Westerners\nand persons of Muslim faith.\nAgain the world\u2019s beady eyes are on\nSudan but instead of focusing on the\ndreadful humanitarian crisis that is\nstill ongoing, I find that our gaze is being shifted from Darfur to Khartoum,\nwhere Liverpudlian Gillian Gibbons\nhas been jailed for insulting the Muslim faith.\nShe allowed her primary school class\nto name a teddy bear Muhammad. This\nwas interpreted as an insult against Islam and the court recognizing the immaterial nature of this insult sentenced\nher to 15 days in prison followed by\ndeportation. Soon after the convic-tion, there were angry demonstrations\nin the capital Khartoum calling for her\nexecution.\nCertainly the demonstrations were\norganized by extremists in a very successful attempt to whip up anti-West-ern sentiment. However the views of\nthe mob are certainly not consistent\nwith the general opinions of Sudanese\npeople, the lenient sentencing (the\nmaximum is 6 months in prison, 40\nlashes and a fine) and the protection\ngiven to Gillian Gibbons (she was held\nin a secret location until her term, was\ncompleted) serve as evidence of this.\nThere is no doubt that Gillian Gibbons did not intend to cause offence to\nanybody and she must be commended\nfor her charitable work in Sudan, however she certainly should not have allowed her class to name the bear Muhammad. It displays a lack of foresight\nthat is dangerous in the 21st century,\nas we\u2019ve seen from these events.What\nis most interesting about this situation is the inability of Western nations\nto respect the sovereignty of African\nnations or the independence of their\njudiciary. An independent judiciary is\none of the pillars of democracy that\nWestern nations attempt to spread\naround the world, yet we are so quick\nto trample upon this independence.\nThe actions of Conservatives Sayeeda\nWarsi and Nazir Ahmed are hypocritical at best and at worst an attempt to\nuse the misery of a British citizen for\npublicity.\nBy traveling to Sudan in an effort\nto circumvent the legal process there,\nthese two peers have displayed an arrogant disregard for the laws of independent nations but also they have\nshown that scoring political points is\ntextbook example being not allowing\na person to shout \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded\ntheatre. However, these limitations\nshould be constrained to speech that\nhas less to do with expression of opinion and more to do with purposeful\nattempts to cause illegal events. This\nwould do away with the absurd \u201chate\nspeech\u201d laws that have dogged Griffin\nand Irving and also limit the definition\nof \u201cencouragement of terrorism\u201d to\ndirect instructions or requests for illegal acts rather than mere expression\nof support for terrorists (see: Samina\nMalik).\nIt all comes down to the definition\nof liberty of speech and why it is im-portant. First it is not about freedom\nof speech per se, but rather the freedom to state one\u2019s opinion. To limit\nthis, in any way, is not just unforgiv-ably depriving a person of liberty but\na dangerous slippery slope to a state of\nthought control where the government\ngets to decide which opinions are bad\nand which are good.\nAs countries go, however, the UK\nis no China. Most of Europe is much\nworse, with Holocaust-denying laws,\nlimitations on criticism of government\nand treason laws being commonly\nfound. The United States, guided by\ntheir constitution can often be a shining beacon of light on this topic; their\nACLU defends everyone from neo-Na-zis to paedophile-rights groups. However, one questions the fair application\nof the freedom principle when consideration is made of Joe McCarthy\u2019s anticommunist drive and recent talk of ille-galising burning the Stars and Stripes.\nIndeed, my libertarian rant must be\ntempered in recognition of Britain\u2019s\nrelative progress, but nonetheless I\ncannot help but wish for a more intelligent discussion than meaningless posturing over an even-more meaningless\nevent at the Oxford Union.\nmore important than bringing peace to\nDarfur. After writing this article, Gillian Gibbons was released.\nShe had spent 8 days in detention\nhowever she did not in fact spend any\ntime inside a jail. Her experience was\ndescribed as \u2018a shock\u2019 but she was well\ntreated. Correspondents are describing the outcome as leaving President\nal-Bashir of Sudan red-faced and\nembarrassed.\nI feel that it is we in the UK who\nshould be embarrassed, at our seeming inability to treat the African continent with anything but Imperialistic\narrogance.\nAbioye Oyetunji\nMs Gibbons was released from custody after a week long fiasco involving blasphemy, cuddly toys and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\nArts\nNo Sex, no Christmas and no fun\nRosie Grayburn reviews the Renaissance Siena exhibition at the National Gallery and is disappointed for\nthe above reasons, if you hadn\u2019t already noticed that. However, if you like virgins, you\u2019ll like this\nThe leaflet advertising the Renaissance Siena\nexhibition at the NG was\nvery inviting. A rosy-cheeked saintly-type wore a very fetching gold halo and she smiled meekly\ndown at me, making a nice, warm\nChristmassy feeling well up inside\u2026\nmuch like mulled wine. So I decided to\ninvestigate.\nBefore I start ranting, I ought to enlighten you geographically-challenged\npeople out there: Siena is in Tuscany,\nItaly. It is a very, beautiful city and extremely well-preserved from the Renaissance due to its status as a World\nHeritage Site - sounds lovely. Advertising over, let\u2019s return to the review.\nThis major exhibition, which has taken the place of the very popular (and\nFREE, might I add) Monet to Picasso\nexhibition, celebrates Renaissance art\nfrom Siena during the politically volatile last century of the Sienese Republic, from 1450-1536. It was a pretty cool\ntime in history, actually. Very wealthy\nfamilies ruled whole cities in Italy and\nthey weren\u2019t the nicest of people at all\n\u2013 scheming, power-hungry bastards\u2026\nJust like your average politician.\nEven the Popes of this era were the\nsons of these families \u2013 elected not\nbecause of their saintly characters but\nbecause Daddy would kill anyone who\nopposed you. Unsurprisingly, lots of\npeople wanted them dead and many\nsucceeded, so lots of gruesome murders occurred throughout this time.\nArmed with this exciting knowledge,\nI threw myself with utmost optimism\ninto the exhibition. On entering Room\n1, you are given a free booklet with\nblurb on each individual painting. I\nfailed to notice the size of this guide at\nfirst, and it was not until I left Room 1\nwith a \u201cHow much more can I take?!\u201d\nkind-of attitude that I flicked to the\nback and counted 116 pieces. Siena\nmust have been stripped bare of all its\nart to fuel this exhibition! I kept going\nfor your sake, reader.\nI couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\nWhen I tried to enter the exhibition,\nthe passage was blocked for the largest\ntour group I have ever seen. And they\nwere Italian - no doubt there to see a\nlittle bit of home whilst on their English tour. Being Italian, they were talking very loudly and posing in front of a\nstatue of the Virgin Mary while cameras flashed all around. Thankfully they\nleft soon after and I was left to contemplate the first painting in peace.\nThe first painting sums up the exhibition wonderfully. A giant Pope\nCalixtus III and a gargantuan Virgin\nMary stand outside the gates of Siena\nand chat to each other in Latin (Ren-aissance speech bubbles included). Religion played a massive part in the\nlife of the Sienese and the fact\nthat their protector, the Pope,\nis pictured here as a giant\nfigure shows his importance\nand power over the lives\nof the people who lived in\nthe city, 500 years ago. The\npainting also shows the\nVirgin Mary\u2019s protection\nover Siena. This theme\ncrops up again and again\nthroughout exhibition.\nMary is always at hand\nto help in a crisis. In the first\nroom alone she is seen protecting the city from an earthquake and\nsaving a ship from a storm - the Renaissance equivalent of Superwoman.\nAt painting number five, I got stuck\nmoving round the room with two very\nenthusiastic art experts. They seem to\nhave waited all their lives for Renaissance Siena to come to town! It was\nquite sweet really. At each painting,\nthey pressed their noses up to the glass\nand commented on things like lines\nand specks. Some old ladies weren\u2019t as\nadmiring as me and whispered viciously behind us. I got scared and moved\nonto Room 2.\nEven the most ignorant viewer could\nnotice the change in style of painting\nbetween one room and the next. I\npreferred these paintings instant-ly, being much clearer and containing more gold. Not only\nthis, but they were generally\nmuch more interesting\npaintings, containing\nlots of religious symbolism and\nmore varied\nsaints. Instead of just plain-old Virgin\nMary, she now is accompanied by a\nrather dashing angel wearing very sexy\narmour and she has a band of cherubs\nplaying Renaissance music around her\nhead. This is shiny, new and improved\nVirgin Mary.\nPerhaps I\u2019m not really selling this to\nyou, but I convinced myself this exhibition was just about worth sticking around for when I came across\nnumber 17 \u2013 a panel depicting\nSaint Agatha and Saint Lucy. At\nthese points, your little booklet is invaluable as it enlightens you with little\nsnippets about these\nparticular saints: \u201c\nThe two women\nare early\nChristian martyrs: Agatha had her\nbreasts cut off during martyrdom; the\ndevout Lucy, in a response to a suitor\nwho admired her beautiful eyes, cut\nthem out and sent them to him.\u201d Now\nthat, ladies, is dedication.\nI breathe a sigh of relief when I reach\na room called \u2018Narrative\u2019. Apparently,\nsome time in the 1450\u2019s, Sienese artists\nbegan to tire of the constant demand\nfor Saints and Virgins and started\nto paint stories, some of which were\nbased on Roman mythology. The style\nof these narratives was quite amusing\nto my simple self.\nNot only are all the stories (from The\nNativity to Antony and Cleopatra) set\nin a landscape not unlike Renaissance\nItaly, but all the landscapes contain\nsuch refined detail that I watch them\nand not the action in the foreground,\nin anticipation of a shepherd mooning\nor a monk streaking across the Tuscan\nHills.\nA couple of interesting pieces in this\nsection included a page from a Renaissance \u201cCompendium of the Natural\nWorld\u201d which gave a much skewed\nview of nature; unicorns, dragons and\nHercules.\nAnother was \u201cAtlas\u201d, the Roman legend who was punished for his revolt\nagainst Jupiter by being condemned\nto holding up the heavens for eter-nity. Poor chap. Still, on the plus side\nyou can see a slightly misshaped Britain labelled on the globe as \u2018Britania\u2019.\nIn Renaissance Italy, The British Isles\nwere a large blob, the size of Africa.\nFascinating.\nA lot of the paintings were allegories,\nmost of which went along the lines of\n\u201cfollowing the difficult path to virtue\u201d.\nI was captivated momentarily by a very\nneat sketch of a young man in a loincloth standing amongst some dramatic\nrock formations. How nice, I thought,\nnaively. In fact, said my booklet, what\nthe artist was trying to show was that\nthis particular young man had chosen the difficult path to virtue instead\nof the easy path to Pleasureland. Lo\nand behold, in the background was\na church that he was making his way\nto\u2026 and I thought he was there for a\nspot of rock-climbing.\nThe depiction of women in this exhibition is an interesting one. One artist states his favourite three kinds of\nwomen in one painting; Virgin, Wife\nand Widow, whilst another shows the\ntale of Huon of Bordeaux who wins the\nright to sleep with the daughter of King\nIvoryn, but only because she loses on\npurpose. She invented Girl Power.\nAmongst the scores of different artists that contributed to this exhibition,\none really stood out for me \u2013 the anonymous \u2018Master of the Story of Griselda\u2019.\nThe piece he is most famous for, hence\nhis title, is a trio of large, brightly coloured paintings depicting the Marriage, Exile and Reunion of Griselda.\nI stayed transfixed on these for ages.\nThey really are fascinating! The story\nof Griselda and her twat of a husband\nis scattered all over the canvas. The\n\u2018chapters\u2019 are displayed around the\nscenes of preparation for the wedding\nwhich these pictures were commissioned for in the first place. You dodge\nservants as you make your way to the\nnext scene in the drama.\nI shall give you a very quick run-through of the plot for this brilliant little story; a rich man (a.k.a. twat) finds\nGriselda (a peasant girl) while out\nhunting and announces he will marry\nher, after gaining her father\u2019s consent\nhe publicly strips her (?!) and after\ntheir marriage he pretends to have\ntheir newborn children killed, stages\na fake divorce and publicly strips her\nagain. Griselda is exiled and becomes a\nservant in her \u2018ex\u2019-husband\u2019s house; he\ntells Griselda to prepare the wedding\nfor his \u2018new\u2019 bride which turns out to\nbe her long-lost daughter; the twat says\nGriselda has proved herself worthy to\nbe his wife and they make up. If only\nNeighbours was as gripping as this.\nThe anonymous artist also excels\nhimself in the Room called \u2018Heroes\nand Heroines\u2019. He shows Alexander the\nGreat look extremely camp and tells us\nthe story of Joseph (of Andrew Lloyd\nWebber fame).\nAfter this highlight I did grow tired\nof the slightly repetitive nature of the\nexhibition. Renaissance Siena is definitely a history lesson and there are\nsome real gems in this exhibition, but\nI still can\u2019t decide whether the trip is\nworth the money. I\u2019d rather go to Siena\nand see them in their hometown with a\nslice of pizza in one hand and a glass of\nvino in the other.\n\u201cJingle Bells, Jingle Bells,\nThis Exhibition\u2019s going away!\nYou\u2019ve got until mid January,\nBut it\u2019s \u00a34.50 you have to pay....\nHey!\u201d (repeat)\nIf you fancy reviewing new exhibitions next year, please get in\ntouch: arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe first in the trilogy of The Story of Griselda. Are you stuggling to woo the woman of your dreams? Why\nnot publicly strip her and THEN propose. She won\u2019t be able to resist your Renaissance charms!\n\u00a9 THE NATIONAL GALLERY, LONDON\nThis is the most \u2018Christmas Cardy\u2019 painting I saw. It doesn\u2019t really have\nmuch depth apart from Mary is looking tired because Jesus has been\nup half the night wanting \u2018bitty\u2019 and Joesph is always out at the pub.\n23\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@Imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 7 December 2007\nfelix\nSport\n44\nThe Men\u2019s Volleyball team have made\nfurther progress in their BUSA first\ndivision title run. They are just back\nfrom a long day of volleyball in Reading, where the 2nd BUSA league event\nwas set. IC defeated in straight sets\ncurrent league champions ULU (who\nwere UK champions 2 years ago) after dismissing our friends at UCL and\nSussex with the same result. All in one\nday \u2013 that is how the BUSA S/E league\nis organised: matches are concentrated\nin 3 weekend events held in different\nvenues.\nIt all started with the usual early rise.\nThe team was amazingly spot on time\nat the minivan park (even the Greeks!!).\nAfter the ritual driver name calling the\nteam overcame the first obstacle \u2013 the\nnefarious back-windscreen wiper was\non (most of the time as someone carefully pointed out). With some resolve\nour safe pair of hands Bruno turned it\noff and swiftly drove into the Cromwell\nRd/A4/ M4/Reading there we go. First\non the spot and ready to warm-up for\nthe first game scheduled for the day.\nIn the meanwhile the coach\u2019s incredibly expensive sat-nav was going crazy\nand taking him into the wilderness\n(which is not too far from Reading Uni\n\u2013 where gulls and local basketball team\ncheerleaders coexist peacefully).\nIC displayed a convincing first set\nand dealt heavy blow to the UCL side.\nNo mistakes in reception meant that\nour basic attack combinations proved\nextremely effective. Our red-devil libero player Christoph showed his usual\nconfidence in leading the IC defence.\nThe spiker Joao showed top form \u2013\nsurely due to his chaste demeanour\nthe night before in the face of unprecedented Goodenough college debauchery (fil dental!). Setter Julio kept\non feeding our outside, middle and opposite (a disciplined and lethal Nicos)\nattack options and soon the second\nset was over. 2-0 for IC and end of the\nundefeated spell for UCL (up to then 3\nwins in a row).\nThe following long break somewhat\ndented the team\u2019s concentration ahead\nof the Sussex game. Or maybe it was\nthe goats cheese, Italian salami and tomato sandwiches on black bread that\nproved too hard to digest for the substitute player in the starting 6. You could\ntell that the coach Donald was not\npleased with an unconvincing though\nvictorious first set against bottom-of-the-league Sussex. The team lacked\nthe neatness and resolve to sweep the\nopposition away as it should have and\nput-purred towards a close win in the\nsecond set. This was useful score-wise\nthough a clear warning bell for the\nteam. Donald quickly summoned the\nteam and got IC to refocus on their\nmotivation, skills and teamwork. The\nteam charged up against the forthcoming challenge against ULU. Players\nkept on talking to each other discussing ways to improve the game. Some\nventured into the Reading wilderness\nfor a quick breath of fresh air \u2013 some\nwent for the team\u2019s pastime of playing\nvolleyball in a squash court (don\u2019t try\nthis at home!)\nAnd that\u2019s when it all happened. IC\ngot on to a cool start against ULU. Our\nmiddle players Konrad and Seb kept on\nblocking and blocking the opposition\u2019s\nspikes. And hitting deadly fast spikes\nacross court in the 3metres line. You\ncould tell ULU were wondering what\nwas going on (see photo: mens_cel-ebration). Our captain Panos did not\nmiss a single hit and his confidence\nwas soon inspiring newcomer Erik too,\nwho was denting the ULU defence.\nThroughout the game a bewildered audience could hear a madman from the\nIC bench shouting a mantra towards\nthe players. Something like be humble,\nbe hungry. This fortunately seemed to\ndistract the opposition more than IC \u2013\npossibly better accustomed to the club\nchairman\u2019s antics. The first set was\nover soon and IC closed it off comfort-ably. Needless to say, the team looked\ncompletely different from what seen\nin the previous match. The second set\nwas a slightly closer race. As in the first\nset, halfway through IC took the lead\nand drove home a result which last\nVolleyball\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 2\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st 0\nVolleyball\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 2\nSussex Men\u2019s 1st 0\nVolleyball\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 2\nULU Men\u2019s 1st 0\nThe Women\u2019s Volleyball team have\nhad a great start to the season. The\nteam was reignited by the new coach\nBarbora and by a healthy mix of old\nguard and fresh recruits. Training\nwork is paying off by an undefeated\nstrike in the BUSA second division\nleague, where they compete against\nother South East Universities. As this\nis a double match report we will look at\nboth the last home and away fixtures.\nTwo weeks ago IC played their home\nfixture against top-rated LSE. The enthusiasm was palpable as our full first\nwomen\u2019s team of 12 outnumbered the\nLSE fashionably-hairdoed opposition.\nThe competition was strong and Imperial took the first set authoritatively.\nA key moment in the initial set was\nwhen IC showed LSE that in volleyball\nit does not matter how high you wear\nyour hair but how high you jump. Alana\nproved the point by delivering the first\nof a few blocks in the match (see photo:\nwomens_block) and the IC lead in the\nset extended to a crucial 17-14. That\u2019s\nwhy in the men\u2019s team those lucky (or\nsilly) enough to have long hair are not\nallowed to wear it up (French guys ex-cluded). Anyway, from then on it was\ndownhill to the close of set (25-18).\nThe second set followed suit. High\nspirits and high jumps such as those\ndisplayed by Karin (see photo: wom-ens_hitKarin) and Chichi both spiking\nand digging (see photo: womens_dig)\nmade sure IC blasted the LSE court\nwith tremendous hits which left the\nopposition in disarray. Everyone was\nthus expecting a straight sets win.\nHome or away, volleyball just keep on winning\nVolleyball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nLSE Women\u2019s 1st 2\nVolleyball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nEssex Women\u2019s 1st 1\nMeanwhile the women were dominating\nWhile IC was trying to clinch what\nwould have been a final 3rd set, the\nconcentration level slipped somewhat.\nIt turned out that LSE weren\u2019t going to\ngive up that easy and fought back to\nwin the two next sets. Assistant coach\nJulio (aka \u201cCoolia\u201d) took countermeasures by giving some players a rest and\nbringing in fresh forces \u2013 Liz\u2019s contribution was noticeable. This meant\nthat the match was to be decided by a\nfinal fifth set \u2013 which is played up to 15\npoints only.\nIC was determined to win and the\ngirls\u2019 determination was shining as\nthey proceeded to get to half-set and\nswap ends on a cool score of 8-3 up.\nTeam spirit was prominent: substituted\nChichi was exemplary off court as on\ncourt - standing on the bench shouting\nsupport throughout the deciding set.\nIC then finished the job by leaving LSE\njust one more point and took the final\nset 15-4, claiming their third victory of\nthe season.\nLast week saw the Imperial women\ntravel to Essex University on a mind-numbing array of forms of transport.\nEverything but a Heathrow-Stansted\ndirect flight (Richard Branson hasn\u2019t\nthought of that yet!) and waterways\nwas tried. The team made it to Colchester in perfect time and was ready\nfor action. Having already beaten Essex\nat home the team were feeling quite\nconfident. This was shown from a confident first set, where the training work\npractising positions on court and rotations gave the team a clear 10 points\nlead. Second set was somehow mixed\nup as distraction and some interesting refereeing decisions from the other\nteams coach meant that the set was\nslipped into the hands of Essex! After\nyear would have been unthinkable: IC\n2 - ULU 0.\nAfter that, all that was missing was\none volleyball (stuck on the ceiling of\na squash court \u2013 retrieved, otherwise\nNicos would not be alive as you read\nthis), one useless Venezuelan minivan\nnavigator, one Reading council which\ndislikes the idea of putting London on\nsignals.. and one more BUSA event\nwhere the final 4 league matches will\ntake place.. see you in Bethnal Green.\nthat, captain Katerina marshalled the\nteam through two victorious sets to\nconclude with a neat 3-1 for IC. Most\nnotably the defence from Valentina\nand Nadia was strong. This allowed a\nsmooth flow of receptions which were\nturned into some great sets from Ashly\n(see photo: womens_set) and hits from\nEmily (see photo: womens_hitEmily)\nand Natalia.\nThese victories have enabled the\nImperial Women\u2019s to be top of their\nleague so far. If this record is maintained this will give them good chances\nto get a good path through to the Trophy finals.\nThat\u2019s what I call digging\nA fine specimen of attack from the middle\nFine block\nBruno Basalisco\nKonrad Kieling\n\n"

All rights reserved. JPMorgan is an equal opportunities employer.\nInternship application deadline: January 13, 2008\nNEXT YEAR,\nJANUARY\nSUMMER\nSTARTS ON\n13.\nThat\u2019s official. It may be cold and wet, but January 13 is the hottest date of 2008. That\u2019s when applications\nare due for our summer internship programme. So hurry. And as the majority of our summer interns\nreceive full-time offers, the outlook\u2019s bright, even if the weather isn\u2019t. This is where you need to be.\nmunism stems from evolution, when it\nadvocates that all men are born equal\nand that the state should take care of\nthem? Similar arguments can be made\nfor anarchism, which is in fact a political theory and not a state of chaos, as\nhe seems to have understood.\nOther logical inaccuracies plagued\nthe lecture, but it\u2019s difficult to remember them all. One that was hard\nto forget, though, is the idea that if an\nimportant scientist had doubts about\nthe theory, it should be discarded alto-gether. That\u2019s just poppycock. I guess\nthat religious people can\u2019t grasp the\nconcept that there are no \u201choly leaders\u201d in science, and that no one\u2019s word\nis considered as law. One might be the\ngreatest asshole on this planet, but if\nhe makes a clever point, the point will\nbe taken on its own merits. Further retractions count for nothing, if not supported by hard evidence. The opposite\nhappens in religion, where contradicting statements made by the same authority are regarded as law, ignoring\ntheir own validity in favor of the institution\u2019s infallibility.\nSpeaking of which, I must emphasize\nthat science\u2019s fallibility and ability to\nconstantly disprove and renew itself\nare not weaknesses; rather, they a re-strengths, showing how new evidence\ncan and often will conflict with what we\nthought as true, a concept that religion\nis not familiar with. Clinging to the\nsame old idea is not something science\ndoes, if there are is evidence to move to\nsomewhere else. I felt offended when\nwe were told that evolution was mindless dogma, and we defended it a priori (same Latin-phrase sort of thing),\ntaking it as truth and never departing\nfrom it. It felt even more insulting as it\nwas said by someone who unquestionably believes in a seventh century book\nby an illiterate merchant which has\nnever been changed in its existence,\nand which is mostly hearsay, oral tradition and copies from previous works\n(I\u2019ll probably earn a fatwa for this, but\nhaving been condemned to hell already\nby the catholic and anglican faiths, it\ncan hardly do any worse).\nFinally, the last points I want to tackle are irreducible complexity and argument by ignorance. The first states that\nthere is a point where you get to a biological structure that can not be simplified further, because if you remove\neven a single part from it, it breaks\napart (an example is the human eye).\nTherefore, such a structure must have\nbeen created, because evolution says\nthat complex things come out of simpler ones. That\u2019s double poppycock.\nThey are assuming that being able to\nsee badly is worse than not being able\nto see at all: but malfunctioning eyes\nare still better than no eyes. If the lens\nis missing, for example, I won\u2019t immediately go blind: I\u2019ll see just badly\n(and maybe lose my sight but that\u2019s not\ncertain). Will it be optimal? No. Will it\nbe better than no eye at all? Yes. You\ncan understand the inaccuracy behind\nthe irreducible complexity argument\neven better if you examine other ani-mals: squids, cats and even some crustaceans have better eyes than us. But\n\u201cScience\u2019s\nfallibility and\nability to\nconstantly renew\nitself are not\nweaknesses.\u201d\nCan something so utterly adorable be the impetus for a scientific debate that has yet to be concluded?\n\n"

However\nDiana sorted this out by scoring only 5\nminutes in to level the score. IC picked\nup their game, with Shipman skilfully\ndefending one of the many aerials and\nD.R. defending well despite the funny\nrunning. IC were awarded a short\ncorner in which an awesome goal was\ndisallowed.\nThis was one of many short corners\nthat IC failed to capitalise on. Kingston\nwere trying their hardest with players\nrandomly diving into the air just in\ncase it would help. It didn\u2019t. IC lead the\nattack but Kingston swiftly reversed\nthis, worrying Foetus and leading to\nshocking tackles for which Shipman\ngot reprimanded but not tossed off.\nMountie called for the team to calm\ndown, but no one seemed to listen.\nKingston managed to get another past\nPlug, but luckily this was disallowed,\nwe have no idea why. IC got attacking\nagain but this time Krusty got angry\nwith the umpires luckily only getting a\ngreen card.\nThis didn\u2019t deter IC but clearly pissed\noff Kingston who took down Diana in\nthe D leading to a penalty stroke being\nawarded. The tension was high but Diana was in control putting another past\nthe keeper, this stroke was on par with\nDominator\u2019s score a few weeks previ-ously. IC were once again in the lead.\nDyke piped up from the sideline that\nall gingers were good at sport which\nwas demonstrated by Paedo and Skull\nF*ck, who created another chance for\nKrusty leading to yet another IC goal.\nKingston got angry and not only\nstarted lobbing the ball into the IC\nspectators but got Shipman so angry\nthat he fouled in the 25 to give away\na short corner. He is a bit of a drama\nqueen and stayed stuck to the floor,\nprobably expecting a yellow card, but\noddly the umpires just gave him another reprimand. Shipman redeemed\nhimself by defending the corner.\nIC then took the worst ever 16 yard\nhit out as Plug needed to dive to save\nShipman from potentially scoring an\nown goal. The half time whistle blew\nand the half time comments weren\u2019t\ninspirational with D.R. saying \u201cfor f**ks\nsake\u201d and Stumpy saying \u201cI\u2019m as bored\nas f**k\u201d. Clearly something wasn\u2019t right\nin the IC camp, so Paedo did his best at\nbuttering up the umpire.\nKrusty\u2019s half time talk must have\nbeen inspirational as IC came out\nfired up. There was great penetration\ndown the left hand side with Krusty\nto Mountie to Diana to Sid to Stumpy\nbefore finding the target leading to another IC goal. Dominator continued to\nchant \u201crun Stumpy run\u201d at any given\nopportunity. Mountie decided diving\nwas called for but actually missed the\nball and D.R. got involved in a bit of\nargy-bargy and the small boy fell over.\nTensions continued to rise with\nKrusty and the Kingston number 3 being spoken to and the Kingston 7 getting a green card. Note at this point\nNugget has his hands down his pants\n\u201cjust checking that they were still\nthere\u201d. It wasn\u2019t that cold up at the Fortress\u2026Stumpy once again claimed he\nwas bored but the defence were working hard especially as they kept giving\naway short corners, and Kingston finally scored another. The Kingston 7 got a\nyellow card but did appologise for his\nMen\u2019s 1 win then shamelessly plug new calendar\nbad tackle. How kind of him. Stumpy\ndecided to do some running claiming\n\u201cI\u2019m going to touch it now\u201d and after\nsome dopey dopey do with Krusty they\ngained another short corner. Alex hasd\nhis drag flick saved but they got another short, this time Diana took it and\nhit home, scoring a hat-trick; the first\nfresher hat-trick of the season.\nThis time working from the back\nFiona Jameson\n& Maria Parkes\nHockey\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 6\nKingston Men\u2019s 1st 2\nFoetus, Sid and Stumpy worked hard\nand fast to score another IC goal. Kingston tried to get back in the game once\nnumber 7 had been allowed back on.\nD.R. took a needless swing at Stumpy\u2019s\ntackle before doing a stylish dive to get\nthe ball back. Shipman got beaten by\na nifty little flick. However it made no\ndifference when the final whistle blew.\nThe post match comments were few\nand far between with Mountie being\ntoo involved in PDAs and D.R. claiming \u201cit was no Friedrichshafen\u201d. The\numpires failed to comment.\nThe team rounded off the match\nwith a team photo posing with the\nfront cover of the ICHC 2008 Calendar. This is on sale now from Hockey\nClub members, just in case you were\nwondering.\nIs that some sort of naked hockey calendar that they\u2019re holding there?\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@Imperial.ac.uk\n46 Friday 7 December 2007\nfelix\nSport\nImperial Team of the Week\nThis week, Sports Partnership along\nwith Felix Sport have chosen the\nHockey Men\u2019s 1st team as their\n\u2018Team of the Week\u2019.\nThe team has had a promising\nstart to the season, losing only one\ngame so far and comfortably winning the rest of them. This continued with the game on Wednesday\naginst Hertforshire, where the final\nscore was 4 \u2013 1 to Imperial.\nWell done lads, let\u2019s hope you can\nkeep this winning streak going into\nthe next term.\nHockey Men\u2019s 1st\nIC Ladies lose gracefully\nHockey\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 0\nPortsmouth Women\u2019s 2nd 7\nChris Baker-Brian\nOk, so the score-line wasn\u2019t great, but\nit has to be noted that the Portsmouth\nLadies were pretty damn hot (apart\nfrom 27).\nUnicycle did well by using her big\nhit to almost clean up a defender and\nEasy Jet almost looked mobile in goal.\nIC worked hard in defence with a good\nclearance by Thombelina. IC weathered the intense pressure from Portsmouth but eventually conceded the\nopening goal. And then another. However once again IC were working well,\nespecially Thombelina to win a free hit\non the left and then a short corner.\nThere was a great chance from\nGhostbuster to create a chance which\nwas narrowly missed on the left. IC\nstarted to have more possession and\ngot another free hit and was played\nwell by Brownie. This was probably\ndue to the great support from the side\nline, especially D.R. in his foil dress.\nThe Portsmouth short was bravely\ndefended by Unicycle, which we used\nto gain a short but Portsmouth literally\nbroke IC down with 3 Times a Lady being injured by Portsmouth number 10\n\u201cthe Tank\u201d which led to goal number\n3. Thombelina showed some Scottish\ndetermination but no luck, they scored\nagain through some good passing. The\nhalf time talk was once again taken\nover by the occasional team manager\nP. Fi and thanks to Dominator for providing the oranges.\nD.R. and Mountie got too involved in\nrescuingthematchballfromthedepths\nof the back of the pitch to concentrate\non the game. Dominator at this time\ndenies Portsmouth a goal but gives\naway a short which they capitalise on.\nIC get angry and Portsmouth get hit\nby the Mystery Sniper. The crowd take\ntime out to work out who was hot or\nnot on the Portsmouth side. Hot were\n4, 30 (but she was a bit skinny), 47 and\n59. Not were 1 (the keeper should have\nkept her kit on), 10 (too much fake tan,\nlooked like a pig and clearly on ster-oids), 13 and 27.\nThis reporter can\u2019t feel his feet at this\npoint. Clearly it was very cold at Harlington. \u201cPigface\u201d ruts on Ghostbuster\nin a tackle, IC are lacking penetration\nof the ring. IC finally win a short corner but this was saved by the keeper,\nthen IC make stick tackle number 347;\na new record. Easy Jet keeps her legs\nclosed for the longest period since the\nbeginning of term and despite it being\n-5\u00baC the girls do very little running.\nThe \u201cTank\u201d was finally taken down as\nshe was twatted by Jess but then they\nscore again. The stick tackle count goes\nup to 511. The umpire decides that he\nhas had enough and after not giving\nany cards but 7 yellows in the previous\nmatch its finally time for Dominator to\nbe tossed off. She is clearly very unhap-py. The final whistle blew shortly after\nto end a long game for the girls.\nHopefully the girls fortunes will turn\nnext week and they can get back to\nwinning ways.\nRugby\nOxford Brookes Men\u2019s 1st 21\nImperial Medicals 1st 27\nLast Wednesday, on a muddy pitch in\nOxford, Imperial Medicals 1st XV got\ntheir BUSA campaign back on track\nwith an impressive 27-21 win over Oxford Brookes.\nHaving been on the receiving end of\na 33-5 beating in the first home game\nof the season against a well-drilled and\nclinical Brookes side, some may have\nthought that the away fixture would\nprove to be much the same. Starting\nthe first half into the wind up the slope\nthe Medicals began confidently and\nshocked a laid-back Brookes side by\ndominating early on, despite having to\nfight the conditions. However, it was\nBrookes who opened the scoring, rather against the run of play, when stand\n-in captain Simon Bellringer slipped\nas he attempted to clear to touch from\nhis own twenty two, gifting the home\nside\u2019s fly-half the opening score and\nsubsequent conversion.\nUnperturbed by their misfortune,\nthe Medicals bounced back straight\nfrom the kick-off. Following a turn\nover from the re-start, the visitors secured good field positions and forced\nthe Brookes pack to concede a penalty in front of the posts. Dan Neville\nduly obliged with a well-struck kick to\ncut the Brookes\u2019 lead to just 4 points.\nThe first half continued to be close,\nbut Brookes, despite the wind, did not\nthreaten the Medicals\u2019 hearty defence.\nIt was the Medicals, indeed, who struck\nnext when a superb turnover and swift\ndistribution by Neville and Nightingale\nsaw Harry Thompson (freshly returned\nfrom elective) free on the wing to expertly run in a try from the 10 metre\nline, which put the Medicals 8-7 up at\nhalf time.\nAfter a rousing team talk from Coach\nKeith Green, the Medicals set about the\ntask of building on their first half lead\nand put pressure on Brookes straight\naway. Astute kicking from Neville and a\nsolid platform from the forwards, both\nin the loose and at the set piece, put the\nMedicals in great attacking field posi-tions, that saw the visitors come close\nto scoring on several occasions. The\npressure began to tell, and when an almost certain try was stopped by a desperate Brookes prop, who was carded\nfor his sins, the Medicals pack put the\nweary Brookes forwards to the sword\nwith a superbly controlled push over\ntry from a scrum, scored by James Saffin at No.8. Neville again obliged with\nthe conversion.\nThe Medicals used their new-found\nconfidence to bully the Brookes pack\nyet further, forcing them back onto\ntheir own line where, with quick feet,\nNeville snuck over the line to claim the\nthird Medicals try of the game, which\nhe then converted. Brookes, now\nwith the full compliment of forwards,\nfought back and stole a try against the\nrun of play through their fullback, who\nwent over under the posts to make\nfor an easy conversion. The Medicals\npack, clearly furious at the cheek of\nthe Brookes side, executed a well-con-trolled line out and drive to push the\nBrookes pack back at a rate of knots!\nIn their desperation and exhaustion\nthe hosts left gaps at the fringes of the\nmaul, which an ever alert Tom Maynard seized upon. Breaking from the\nback of the maul, scrum-half Maynard\nbeautifully stepped the fullback and\nwinger and outpaced the covering defenders to dive over in the corner for\nwhat proved to be the winning try.\nThe pugnacious Brookes team, aided\nby the sin binning of Medicals 2nd row\nRob Anderson, again advanced and,\ndespite some hearty defence from the\nvisitors, forced their way over to make\nthe score 27-21. However, with only 1\nminute on the clock the try was immaterial and the Medicals had triumphed!\nThe Great Escape starts here...\nMedics winning ways return\nSimon Bellringer\nIliotibial Band Syndrome\nThe ITB emerges from the tensor fas-cia lata (TFL) which runs down the\noutside thigh just below the hip. The\nupper portion of the band ascends vertically to attach at the top of the hip\n(hence the name ilio), whilst the lower\nportion runs all the way down the side\nof the thigh before attaching to the\noutside of the tibia, just below the knee\n(hence the name tibial).\nSo in effect the TFL and ITB are very\nclosely interlinked and therefore signs\nand symptoms, as well as treatment\nshould focus on both rather than one\nor the other. However as the entire\nmusculoskeletal structure is interwoven rehabilitation would need to take\ninto account the effects on the surrounding muscles as well.\nSymptoms of the ITBS frequently\ninclude tenderness, aching and/or\npain just below the knee on the outer\nedge, but pain or irritation can also be\npresent much further up in the TFL\nitself or in its tendinous connection\nwith the hip. The pain may occur while\nrunning, while walking downstairs\nand sometimes during weight bearing\nactivities.\nUsually pain will not be identifiable\nuntil you are a few miles into a run.\nHowever once it starts it tends to be\npersistent if you keep running through\nit, and frequently gets worse during\ndownhill running and while walking\ndown steps. The discomfort can radiate up and down the leg, but will often\nalmost disappear if you stop running\nand begin to walk slowly and shorten\nyour stride.\nThe key source of ITB syndrome\ndisorders is actually a lack of flexibility\nin the ITB, which impacts the biome-chanics of the body. A tight ITB basically pulls other structures out of their\ntrue alignment causing muscular im-balance. This alteration can then create a pain response.\nThere are a number of reasons why\nthis lack of flexibility occurs: Running\non a track or on crowned roads can\ncreate a muscular imbalance as the\noutside leg takes in more force during\nrunning. A leg length discrepancy, as\nthe shorter leg receives greater stress\nas it falls a greater distance before\nthe foot makes actual impact with the\nground.\nHaving bow legs, excessive leg muscle tightness, or very pronounced foot\npronation can all increase the risk of\nITBS.This syndrome also appears to be\nrelated to weak hip abductors, so the\ngluteal complex and the TFL may require strength training.\nIf you are concerned about this particular type of injury, feel free to come\nand speak to an Energia instructor who\ncan advise on preventative measures,\ntreatment and active rehabilitation.\nHannah Barr\nTemper temper Anderson, you don\u2019t want to get sin-binned.

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\nNews\nIC can\u2019t get no satisfaction?\nFelix interviews the Dean of Students and the students themselves to discuss university satisfaction\nTom Roberts\n& Andrew Somerville\nThis week Felix conducted interviews\nwith the student body and the newly\nappointed Dean of Students, Professor\nDavid Lloyd-Smith, to find out about\nwhat new students feel about their first\nterm at Imperial College. Prompted\nby results from the National Student\nSurvey (NSS) released in August 2007\nin which Imperial was ranked 68th for\nstudent satisfaction, and the influence\nthat this has on the Good University\nGuide, the investigation was designed\nto give the new students a way to voice\ntheir first opinions of College after only\na few months of exposure.\nOver 25 first year Imperial students\nwere asked to fill out a survey which\nposed questions about how they have\nfound their first term, including:\nworkload, halls life, their experiences\nwith the Union and the College, and\nhow the Imperial compares with their\nfriends\u2019 universities. Students were\nalso told about the Good University\nGuide results in which Imperial would\nhave ranked first had it not been for\npoor student satisfaction, instead finishing third overall, and asked about\ntheir reaction.\nThe students\u2019 responses are on the\nfollowing pages. Due to space issues,\nnot everyone surveyed made publica-tion. It was decided to select people\nwhose opinions reflected views that\nwere popularly found, and whose answers were well reasoned. Similarly,\nthere were more questions asked than\ncould be published; those chosen to\nmake the final article were picked to reflect the most important and most interesting issues covered by the survey.\nFelix also interviewed Professor\nLloyd-Smith to ask him about his new\njob, the newly created position: Dean\nof Students, how it relates to students,\nhis aims and the issue of student satis-faction. The question and answer transcription follows below.\nThese student interviews are not\ncomprehensive. They were conducted\nmainly on a Wednesday afternoon (a\nday when many students are not in\nCollege) around campus, in the Union\nand also in a hall of residence.\nJudging from the people that Felix\nspoke to, there seems to be a common\nconsensus that students have to work\nvery hard at Imperial. Opinion over\nthe social side of university is divided,\nhowever the students mostly remain\npleased that they have come to Imperial with nearly everyone stating that\nthey would choose Imperial again,\nwith hindsight.\nThe results are surprisingly positive\ncompared to what the National Student\nSurvey suggests. One thing to note is\nthat Felix only surveyed first year students this time around, whereas the\nNSS was based on responses from final\nyear students. Are the results positive\nbecause we\u2019ve only interviewed fresh-ers who haven\u2019t experienced the entire\nyear, including the stresses of exams, or\nhas the College improved so vastly in\nthe previous few months that students\nare more satisfied than before?\nFelix is interested to see whether\nthese opinions change over the course\nof their studies, so tune in this time\nnext term when we\u2019ll be conducting\nmore surveys to find out just how satisfied Imperial\u2019s student body is.\nHowever, before we get to the students\u2019 views, the Question & Answer\nsession with the new Dean of Students\nfollows.\nThe recently appointed Dean of Students, Professor David Lloyd-Smith\nWhat\u2019s does the new role of Dean\nof Students entail?\nThe position has been newly created\nover the summer. Effectively, the duty\nof the old Pro-Rector (Educational\nQuality) have been divided into two.\nIt was felt that this Pro-Rector position needed to be reconfigured, so it\nwas much better to separate it into two\njobs.\nThe current Pro-Rector (Educational\nQuality) is responsible for strategic\nthinking and the quality of our education program whereas my role as Dean\nof Students is focussed towards welfare\nand pastoral care. I oversee the College\ntutors and hall wardens, help student\ncouncillors deal with problems when\nthey arise, sort out issues to do with\ndisabled students and I have a wider\ninvolvement with things that might affect students at Imperial, such as government policy changes.\nBefore the creation of the Dean of\nStudents position all of these tasks\nwere tackled by the Pro-Rector (Educa-tional Quality). The division of duties\nhas freed up the current Pro-Rector to\nfocus on building up the strategic education that needs to be enhanced.\nWhat\u2019s currently on your Agenda?\nI think I\u2019m very largely still trying to\nfind out what Rees Rawlings [the previous Pro-Rector (Educational Quality)]\ndid and what the job\u2019s all about.\nWhat are your ambitions for the\nrole?\nI thought we had a very good system\nunder Rees Rawlings and I think he\nput an enormous effort into ensuring\nthat students enjoyed life at Imperial\nCollege on all aspects from sporting\nactivities to cultural ones, to ensuring the quality of courses here were\nhigh for students. I think he left a very\ngood legacy but one cannot be complacent about the things \u2013 they need\nmaintaining.\nAt the moment we are shifting our focus here and there depending on what\u2019s\ngoing on at the time. For instance, we\nare being driven by statutory instruments to comply with the governments\nchanging disabilities acts.\nAnother serious problem presented\nto us at the moment is with under-18\nstudents. We have more than ever before and they all be in halls or living at\nhome. Wardens are under extra pressure when these students are residents\nin their halls and I\u2019m here to offer extra\nhelp.\nIs your appointment directly\nrelated to the creation of the new\nStudent Hub?\nI think that the Student Hun is a notion\nof centralising all of the key student\nsupport services \u2013 a one-stop shop.\nAlthough it\u2019s to do with Welfare as a\nplace where there is a group of people\nwho can be relied on to provide the\nmajority of answers to students\u2019 ques-tions, I wouldn\u2019t say my role is involved\nwith it directly: it\u2019s more of a national\ntrend that has occurred at universities.\nWhat is the mechanism you use\nto monitor what students feel\nabout their university experience?\nDo you use SOLE?\nSOLE is primarily used for academic\npurposes and quality assurance. But it\nalso has the facility to try to deal a bit\nmore widely with the student experi-ence, particularly with first year students who we would like to get a bit\nmore evidence about.\nIf SOLE is not operating efficiently\nthen we will consider how to modify\nit with better questions. It is a system\nthat seems to be flexible to be amended as we see fit.\nOther mechanisms include student\nliaison officers who report back to us\nafter finding out what is going on in\nthe various courses and also the national questionnaire that students fill\nout from which we get information on\nthe student experience from those who\ncompleted the survey [NSS].\nEarlier you said that you believe\nunder the current system you\nhave been left a good legacy of\nmaking sure that students\u2019 welfare is in a good condition \u2013 how\ndo you think this is reflected in\nthe student satisfaction survey?\nThe results have been quite poor\nfor Imperial. For instance, in the\nGood University Guide Imperial\nwould be top if it wasn\u2019t for the\npoor satisfaction of students \u2013\nsurely that is slightly worrying?\nMy experience is that the students I\ndeal with seem to be focussed on their\nreason for being at Imperial College\nwhich is to study science, technology,\nmedicine, to get a good degree and to\nget a good job as a result of that. Dissatisfaction with the quality of education received here doesn\u2019t seem to be\nhigh, in my view.\nSo the dissatisfaction you\u2019re turning\nyour attention to may be to do with\ncultural life at the College, with extra-mural experiences and sports activites.\nI\u2019m not sure though: when you look at\nsport here with the massive new sports\ncentre and also the highest proportion\nof sporting activity in the UK, it\u2019s difficult for me to understand why students\nfeel that the student experience at Imperial is that much less than at other\nuniversities.\nMyself and Rees Rawlings are and\nhave been constantly talking to students to find out how they\u2019re enjoying\nlife at Imperial.\nCertainly we are trying to find out\nwhy it\u2019s happening. It could be that at\nthat time of year [when students have\nto take SOLE] they get fed up taking\nquestionnaires. Perhaps taking two\nthings like this is maybe causing some\ndifficulty. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t answer the\nquestion though to be honest with you\nas I\u2019m new to the job.\nDo you think that the workload\nat Imperial is preventing students\nfrom doing activities outside of\ntheir studies?\nIt\u2019s a very interesting question and it\ndepends what you want to compare it\nwith. If you compare it with European\ninstitutions on the continent you would\nhave to say the student workload in the\nUK is much less. For example, students\nin France spend 39 to 40 weeks, not 30\nweeks, as we do, on their study activi-ties. People who go there expect to get\na good job and I think that people who\ncome to Imperial also have to expect\nto work hard because the profit from\ndoing so is immense. If you graduate\nwith a degree from Imperial it has a\nhigh cach\u00e9, it has good value and you\ncan turn it to many things such as getting a good job or going on to another\nuniversity such as by doing a PhD at\nCambridge. Employers respect a degree from here.\nIn Germany students work for a minimum of five years to get their diploma\nand they work all year round.\nShould we be comparing ourselves with European universities\nor ones from the UK?\nWe feel that we measure ourselves\nagainst the best continental universities and institutions across the world.\nWe want to measure ourselves against\nthose that are most highly rated and\nso the workloads in general have to\nbe proportional with the quality\nof the degree, the quality of the\nwhole experience and its value\nof turning it into a job or a\nposition at another uni-versity. Students who\ncome here, by and\nlarge, know what\nthey are getting themselves\ninto.\nT\nu\nr\nn\no\nv\ne\nr\nf\no\nr\nt\nh\ne\ns\nt\nu\nd\ne\nn\nt\ns\n\u2019\no\np\ni\nn\ni\no\nn\ns\nQ&A with\nProfessor\nLloyd-Smith\n\n"

You know who you are.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re not one\nof these people, then I don\u2019t know how\nyou got this copy of Felix, but if you\u2019re\never in London then feel free to drop\ninto Imperial and say hello. If you\u2019re an\nDon\u2019t call them CV monkeys!\nBatul Kaj\nD\nespite its crudeness,\nJames Wang\u2019s article\nfrom a couple of weeks\nago did flag up some\ntruths. Yes, year rep\nelections are a popularity contest and\nyes, manifestos are often quite similar\nbetween candidates. But, if you ask me,\nneither is a bad thing, especially when\nit comes to year rep elections.\nFirstly, how many of you actually\nknow what a year rep\u2019s job is? James,\ndo you? I\u2019m guessing not, because if\nyou did, you would have realised that\nin fact being \u2018approachable\u2019 and \u2018able\nto address concerns\u2019 are possibly the\nA. Geek\nImperial student, then please don\u2019t lie\nto yourself. You\u2019re a smug tosser who\u2019s\nlapped up recent events.\nYou see, I managed to avoid covering\nour THES promotion a few weeks back\nby screwing my eyes shut and travelling to my happy place in Smurfland.\nThis was made considerably harder by\nmy gimp of a lecturer stumbling into\na morning talk with the kind of \u201cfuck\nyou\u201d smugness I normally associate\nwith Jeremy Kyle or the United Nations Security Council. The sarcastic joke that \u201cwe don\u2019t care about the\nratings, of course\u201d made it even more\nskin-crawling.\nBecause the truth is that it\u2019s all you\ncare about, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always found a little weird. When we\nthought Britney Spears was attractive\nand spent Friday evenings at house\nparties listening to Franz Ferdinand\nand pretending we were somewhere\nelse, things like THES were moderately important because applying to a\nshit university would gain you very lit-tle. In theory. I\u2019ve got some bad news\nfor you, though. See, it turns out that\nif you decide to stay as a childish laya-bout fuckwit whilst at university, you\u2019ll\nactually still be one when you graduate.\nYou\u2019re at Imperial now, everyone. Time\nto wake up and smell the inadequacy.\nNot long after the aforementioned\nsenior tutor pantomime, a friend of\nmine related the story of a \u201cSkills\nWorkshop\u201d she had attended that she\npromised me was a \u201chead hunt\u201d. Why\nelse would they stage it at Imperial. Of\ncourse. The \u201chead hunting\u201d day had\nbeen open to all years, mind you, and\nlargely involved sitting through PowerPoint lectures, presumably the kind\nthat makes you want to gnaw off various extremities.\nI\u2019m not sure what skills were leant,\nbut I do know that there haven\u2019t been\nany job offers yet; I can only assume\nthis is because the attendees were exactly the kind of idiots that think an\nactivity day is an interview in disguise,\nleaving the organisers to fend off the\nshambling, overeager gits with free\npens .\nMy point \u2013 if there\u2019s one still left after\nten weeks of ridiculous courseworks,\nthis bloody comment section and spats\nof high blood pressure \u2013 is this: Imperial is not a genius factory. Its ranking\nwas obtained by a small minority working extremely hard, and another small\nminority manipulating statistics with\ntwice as much effort. If you are coming\nto the close of your first term here having done nothing and not caring, then\ndon\u2019t expect to graduate at the same\nlevel as everyone else. You didn\u2019t win\nthe big number five rating \u2013 the build-ings, faculties and facilities did.\nThe good news is that it means you\nhave plenty of room to become genuinely good graduates. But if you think\nPowerPoint-giving suits are going to\nassume you\u2019re competent as-is, think\nagain, because employers do look past\nthe university section on a CV, and\nAAB at A-Level won\u2019t be enough to\nconvince them you\u2019re a worthy addition to the human race.\nMerry Christmas, everyone. Don\u2019t\nwork too hard this holiday.\ntwo most important qualities a year\nrep candidate should possess. Sure,\nyou could argue that if someone writes\nthose things in a manifesto, it doesn\u2019t\nmake them true\u2026 but then I guess the\nonly way to get around that would be\nto know the person. Do you agree that\npopularity is a measure of how many\npeople know you?\nAnd yes, the manifestos all looked\nthe same\u2026 but all of the candidates\nwere standing for the same position,\ni.e. they were all trying to prove themselves ideal for the same role. Any\none of them could have made promises about new vending machines and\nQueen\u2019s Tower-related adventures, but\nthey would have been totally irrelevant\nand would in fact have demonstrated\na complete lack of understanding of\nwhat the job entails.\nWhat I really must object to though,\nis the use of the phrase \u2018CV monkeys\u2019.\nPeople are so quick to accuse candidates of \u2018only doing it for the CV\u2019 but\nthat\u2019s like saying \u2018you\u2019re only doing\nMedicine at Imperial so that you can\nget a job\u2019. It\u2019s daft. If someone wants\nto run for a position, let them \u2013 even if\nthey\u2019re doing it for CV points, they still\nmight be good at it, and as a voter, that\nshould be the most important thing.\nIf you\u2019re worried about them getting\nahead of you in the CV game, nobody\u2019s\nstopping you from standing yourself.\nTo really make these elections worth-while, the ball is in the voters\u2019 court. If\nyou want to make the right decision,\nmake the effort to find out what it\nmeans to be a year rep and then make\nthe effort to find out which candidates\nreally can deliver what they say they\nwill. (Or else, don\u2019t cry about spamming when they try to tell you about it\nthemselves.)\nAnd please, for God\u2019s sake, demonstrate how well we\u2019ve evolved by avoiding the \u2018She pretty. Me vote\u2019 strategy.\nT\nhis is in reply to Stefan\nOlsson Robbie`s Let`s talk\nabout God, some more.\nTrying to explain the blatantly obvious \u2018cause and\neffect\u2019 resulting from regular rituals\nwith your lab partner, girlfriend and\nfriends etcetera is definitely not the\nway to justify the impact you have on\nyour life, because firstly the common-placeness of these rituals gives them\nzero weightage.\nSecondly, unless you believe in self-worth as defined only by the ability to\nmake juvenile yet caustic comments\nlike \u201cheard of Pythagoras?\u201d or emulate a dead, albeit famous mathematician from a bygone era (and in either\nor both of these cases you are a lost\ncause and may not continue reading)\nyour ability to send a rebuttal in a self-consciously victorious manner to Richard realizes the existence of an Entity outside the confines of time, space\nand all forms of human reasoning as\nwell as spatial and temporal existence\nas we know them. This is because your\nability to reason is not ultimately your\ndoing. Time started for you only after\nyou were miraculously fashioned from\nthe \u2018discharge\u2019 of your parents and later\non became specialized enough to reason about everything. And that in itself\nshould suffice to toss out any Darwin/\nEvolution hogwash that might have entered your thoughts.\nGod made you, and your mother and\nfather were just a means. Nothing after\ntime is self-triggered except God, who\nexists before time and is a part of the\npast, future and present at the same\nmoment in \u2018time\u2019 as we see it. He controls everything that you can possibly\nimagine as well as things beyond your\nimagination. And this holistic \u2018cause\nand effect\u2019, unlike your simplistic ex-amples, is the real \u2018cause and effect\u2019\nthat people like yourself don\u2019t under-stand. That is what is actually implied\nby \u201clife is pointless without God\u201d. It\u2019s\npointless in the holistic sense, and not\nin the immediate sense as you have\nconsidered it.\nAlso, an obvious implication of \u201cbig\ndude in the sky\u201d or \u201cHe will appreciate that you like Him, tried to create!\u201c\nis that you believe, however little, that\nthere may be a certain entity out there.\nAnd that just means that at a certain\nlevel, even you are a believer.\nFinal word on the\nGod debate. Maybe\nHadeed Khalid\nLetter to Felix\n8 months on and\nthe \u2018temporary\u2019\nmarquee is still\nthere\nDear Felix,\nLast year there was a bit of a hoo-hah\nabout College trying to build semi-per-manent offices on a third of Queen\u2019s\nLawn and trying to slip it through\nplanning permission without us notic-ing. This was obviously stopped with\nthe help of Felix, but then in April we\nwere given a huge tent which covers\n95% of the Lawn. In case anyone hasn\u2019t\nnoticed, it is still there. Queen\u2019s Lawn\nshould really be renamed seeing as the\ngrass is by now slightly dead and will\nneed to be completely returfed if the\ntent ever leaves.\nWe expect to see giant marquees for\na few weeks over the year for Summer\nBalls, Fresher\u2019s events, Careers fairs\netc; but for 8 months solid and with no\nend in sight? I don\u2019t remember being\ngiven a referendum on this issue like\non the NUS, and I certainly don\u2019t understand why College thinks it can get\naway with it, considering the backlash\nover previous plans. They had originally planned on having one third of the\nLawn taken up with offices, so where\nhad they thought to put this marquee?\nIf the plans hadn\u2019t included the tent\nbefore, why did they immediately after\nthe planning rejection?\nFrench students by now would probably have torched the Rector\u2019s house\nand joined with the transport unions to\nbring down the city in wildcat strikes,\nbut we just sit on the benches under\nthe Queen\u2019s Tower and comment on\nthe lack of view towards the library.\nYours Faithfully,\nTom Culley\nThe Editor, Tom Roberts, responds:\nIn case you missed it somehow, you\u2019ll\nsee that on page 2 there\u2019s a short picture story about this very topic. Thankfully the marquee will finally be coming\ndown in the next few weeks.\nExcuse me whilst I deviate from the\ntopic slightly, but whilst I\u2019ve got your\nattention it\u2019s time to say Happy Christmas from everyone at Felix and we\u2019ll\nsee you in the New Year!\n\n"

    "content": "With any luck this will be my last rant\nabout the National Union of Students\nuntil the spring. After a long day and a\ncramped journey home in the Imperial\nCollege Union funbus on behalf of\nour nine delegates I am delighted to\nreport that we got our own way at NUS\nExtraordinary Conference in Leicester\non Tuesday. Conference overwhelmingly\nvoted in favour of the proposed changes\nto the NUS constitution and Imperial\u2019s\nproposed amendment which means that\nstudent trustees will be democratically\nelected instead of just going through an\nappointment process.\nOur delegates left this event fully\naware of why it is vital that the current\nstructures are scrapped. On Tuesday\nwe spent a ridiculous amount of time\ndebating procedure rather than the\nsubstance of the governance review\nand if the new constitution passes\nthe NUS will move away from the\narcane, overly formalised process of\nsubmitting and discussing motions to\nsomething a bit more accessible to\nordinary students. As I have previously\nstated, the new arrangements whereby\nall financial responsibility rests with a\nsmall, highly skilled Board of Governors\nshould prevent the waste and general\nsilliness that came about from having a\nbunch of 27 highly politicised students\non the National Executive Committee\ntaking some very important decisions.\nI mentioned in my speech against the\nwrecking amendment submitted by\nManchester Students\u2019 Union titled\n\u201cSave NUS Democracy\u201d that it was\nfairly absurd that the organisation\ncurrently spends more money on the\ndecision making process than it does on\ncampaigning. Having lots of meetings\nis no doubt terribly fun for the sad\nold hacks like me who would end up\nattending them but probably isn\u2019t that\ngreat for the average student who just\nwants to see that NUS get on with doing\nstuff that is relevant to them.\nTo draw this matter to a close for now,\nspeaking from the point of view of\nsomeone who thought it was a waste\nof our time, effort and money affiliating\nto what is currently a fairly ridiculous\norganisation it was humbling to hear\none of their\nVice Presidents\ndescribe the NUS\nas a \u201cbankrupt,\nshambolic farce\u201d\nthat \u201clacks\ninfluence.\u201d The\nNUS leadership\nhave kindly\nwritten a\ndisaffiliation campaign for Union\u2019s like\nImperial who would be very unhappy\nshould the reforms fail and I am\nhappy to take that as evidence of their\ncommitment to sort themselves out. If\nyou have got this far (NUS governance\nis a bit drab\u2026 yawn..) have a very happy\nChristmas break and I look forward to\nseeing you in 2008.\nunionpage\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nNUS Extraordinary Conference\nAs the Centenary Year draws to a\nclose Imperial College Union has\nfinally completed its search for a\ncompelling and profound New Years\nResolution. After a long summer\nof compiling evidence to create an\nimpressive document detailing Fairtrade\nProducts, events and publicity on the\nImperial College Campus the Fairtrade\nFoundation has announced last week\nthat we were successful in our bid for\nFairtrade University Status. Having got\ninvolved in the campaign for Fairtrade\non our Campuses at Freshers\u2019 Fair in\nmy first year I think this is the biggest\nachievement that I have made as an\nImperial College Student and something\nthe College and its students should be\nreally proud of for making it happen.\nOver the past eight years considerable\npressure has been placed on the College\nfrom Student Campaigners to increase\nits Fairtrade offering. Recognised as ULU\nStudent Campaign Group of the Year\nin 2006, the Fairtrade Campaign Group\nwent on to form the Fairtrade Society\nin 2007. In the same year the Fairtrade\nSteering Group, a joint collaboration\nbetween Imperial College London and\nImperial College Union, was formed\nand the Union and College both passed\nnew policies stating their intentions to\npromote and support Fairtrade on our\nCampus.\nFairtrade University Status is a mark of\nrecognition for the efforts of the College\nand Students\u2019 Union to promote and\nsupport Fairtrade Products. By becoming\na Fairtrade University we will be able to\nimprove social and cultural awareness\namongst staff and students and highlight\nthe way in which our actions can affect\nthe standard of living for a wide variety\nof people all over the world. Imperial\nCollege Graduates, as the World\nLeaders of tomorrow, have a wide social\nresponsibility to support high standards\nof ethical and environmental influences\nin future global trading. The importance\nof such matters becoming more and\nmore evident in the choices made by\nconsumers, prospective students and\nbusinesses all over the world.\nThe demand for Ethical Products on\ncampus is high, with over 1.6 million\nFairtrade Hot Beverages being served in\nthe past year. Imperial College Union\u2019s\nnew range of Fairtrade Hoodies and\nT-shirts have been flying off the shelves,\nwith the colours, designs and quality\nof the garments exceeding everyone\u2019s\nexpectations. Having achieved Fairtrade\nStatus in such a short period of time,\nthe Fairtrade Society and the Union are\nturning their efforts towards the Borough\nof Westminster and the City of London,\nto help in their campaigns for Fairtrade\nStatus.\nIt is particularly fitting that Imperial\nCollege has received this long awaited\nrecognition during its Centenary Year.\nWith new environmental initiatives being\nimplemented and these positive steps\nin social responsibility and awareness\nImperial is finally closing the gap with\nits competitors and is no longer lagging\nbehind on important global issues. It is\na great cause for celebration and will\nsend a positive message to our dynamic\nmulti-cultural society, our prospective\nstudents, graduate employers and the\ngovernment.\nPositively Red SHAG Week\nLast week saw one of the most\nenergetic and vibrant campaigns to\nhit Imperial College Campus in recent\nmemory. Collaboration between Imperial\nCollege Union, Medsin, Sexpression\nand Positively Red led to a huge array\nof events and\nactivities raising\nawareness about\nSexual Health and\nfundraising for\nAIDs Charities:\nChildren with\nAIDs (CWAC) and\nPositively Heath\nUK (POSH).

The\nflash mob on Upper Dalby Court and\nthe events in the Union were also well\nattended with approximately 100 people\nturning out to watch professional Pole\nDancers and party with Ann Summers\nlast Friday night.

With only five of them having\nshowed up on time, the people present\nstarted feeling a little bit uncomfort-able. Thankfully, a few more arrived,\njust in time to catch the bus to Harlington. The opposition team was Sussex 2nd and once again, the IC women\nwere short of players. They came out\nonto the pitch, the thirteen opposition\nplayers pointing and grinning at the\neight of them at the thought of an easy\nvictory.\nThe above could be the start of any\nWednesday match report, as the IC\nwomen have so far been playing the\nmajority of their Wednesday BUSA\ngames short of players. This, however,\nhas not stopped them from winning\nthree and drawing two games out of a\ntotal six played; and from being second\nof their BUSA group, tagging to the top\nteam rather closely. But let us go back\nto the actual game. Although I should\nnot really spoil the ending, I will say\nthat having thirteen players did not\nbring much luck to the Sussex women!\nDespite their win, the start of the\ngame had not begun well for the IC\nChloe Joyeux\nFootball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nSussex Women\u2019s 2nds 1\nTHE LINKS CLUB\n1926\nLinks Award\nThe Links Club of the City and Guilds of\nLondon, would like to announce their award\nfor any student within the City and Guilds\nCollege who is an active member within the\nGuilds or who has excelled on the sporting\nfront.\nThe award is a bursary of \u00a3250 and will\nbe presented to the eventual winner at The\nLinks Club annual dinner in June 2008.\nCandidates must submit an application no\nlonger than 300 words, either by email to\nhonsec@linksclub.org or hand it in to the\nCGCU office in a sealed envelope by 1st\nMay 2008. Entrants must outline why they\nbelieve they deserve the award.\nwomen. Eight players made it to Harlington on time, with a ninth, Gools,\nsupposed to arrive as soon as possi-ble. IC kicked-off but lost the ball very\nquickly. In fact, so quickly that a Sussex\ngoal was scored within the first 10 to\n11 seconds. The team was taken aback.\nEither the Sussex confidence was at\nmaximum level or IC was clearly half\nasleep. Ether way, the IC team quickly\nregained their senses and started doing what they do best, playing football!\nThey still struggled to keep the ball in\nthe Sussex half and a free kick, meters\nfrom the goal, was luckily saved by\nEmily. Twenty minutes after kick-off,\nhowever, the miracle happened and the\ngirls saw Gools running towards them.\nShe changed at lightning speed and appeared on the pitch. The super Gools\nhad made it and was the inspiration\nthe IC Ladies were waiting for. IC was\nable to push forward more confidently.\nNothing spectacular happened for the\nrest of this half except for a ridiculous\nfoul on Chloe, sending her flying 2 meters forward, and Pav the beast, fighting against 6 Sussex players at a time.\nThe second half is therefore where\nall happened. Emma decided to change\nthe team formation from a 4:3:1 to a\n3:4:1 and this made all the difference!\nWhile Steph, Chloe, and Pav had been\nstruggling to keep the ball in the Sussex half during the first part of the\ngame, it seemed unbelievably easy\nwith the help of Kate on the left. Pav\nand Lily were therefore free to fire at\nthe Sussex goal wildly. All IC players\nhad a go at shooting, even Emma from\nthe half way line. Despite all her goals\nbeen on target, however, she was not\nable to secure the ball to the back of\nthe net. The first goal originated with\na pass from Steph from the right at the\n55th minute. Pav jogged comfortably\ntowards the box and her powerful kick\ndid the rest. Not wanting to stop here,\nPav secured the win another ten minutes later with a pass from Kate this\ntime. The solid defence led by Emma,\nGools, and Cheryl enabled the rest of\nthe team to push forward comfort-ably, still creating more chances and\nopening. The Sussex ladies continued\nrunning after the ball, trying to play\naggressively but not having enough\nplayers to bend the IC team. Emily\u2019s\nonly real threat during this second half\nseems to have been their number 14.\nSuddenly inspired, she broke from the\nhalf-way line and sprinted towards the\ngoal. Luckily, Emily won this battle and\n14 came back with her tail between\nher legs. Lilly pushed the Sussex girls\naround, getting a few warning from\nRichie P. (although denied by Lilly). IC\nwas able to win a few corners, although\nnone ended up in the back of the net.\nThe final goal and blow to Sussex came\nminutes from the end (43rd minute),\nwith a pass from Pav to Lilly. Lilly put\nin a perfectly clean shot which passed\nthe Sussex keeper, at uncontrollable\nspeed, therefore sealing the IC victory.\nThis successful day ended with Steph\nhaving received no beef and with the\nSussex coach praising the IC efforts\nand courage. The IC ladies are now officially the best team to win with missing players.\nThe inaugural Inter-University Tai Chi\ncompetition in the UK took place on\nSaturday 1st December 2007 in Manchester with Imperial College Wushu\nSociety taking three gold medals.\nShaopeng Li and Allan Martin, both\nmembers of the Wushu Society, gave\nvery impressive performances, demonstrating Tai Chi 42 Step Hand Form,\nStraight Sword and Sabre forms and\neasily attaining the top podium positions for each respective category. Furthermore, both Shaopeng and Allan\nachieved the highest scores of the day,\nplacing themselves far ahead of the\nother competitors from Bath, CamImperial Wushu take gold at\nTai Chi nationals\nEugene Chang bridge, Manchester and Leeds.\nShaopeng and Allan have been training as part of the Society\u2019s Demo Team,\na group dedicated to performing and\ncompeting in Chinese Martial Arts.\nThe Demo Team will be performing\nin the upcoming Chinese New Year\ncelebrations at the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum, ArtsFest \u00b408 and East Meets\nWest \u00b408.

I was\npepping up for a nice big issue to finish the term with - only to find out that\nthis is the last issue for the term. So,\nbasically this meant that there was little to no time to arrange the better portions and so they were left out, sadly.\nOuch.\nAt any rate, this hopefully means\nthat the New Year can start off with a\nbit of a bang. A few new sections are\nunder construction (and under wraps)\nand we\u2019re sorting out a nice bumper issue to kickstart 2008\u2019s run. We\u2019ve got\nquite a few games to cover, so feel free\nto drop us a line if you wish to write\nabout any particular game that\u2019s rel-evant. So basically you can expect\nthe Felix Games touch for Assassin\u2019s\nCreed, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools\nof Destruction, Call of Duty 4: Modern\nWarfare, Mass Effect and others that\nwe will lovingly trudge through during the cold winter months. After that\nyou can expect plenty of hype as we\nprepare ourselves for the likes of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Devil May\nCry 4, Alan Wake, Burnout Paradise,\nKillzone II and of course, the one and\nonly (sorry, had to) Metal Gear Solid 4:\nGuns of the Patriots. These games will\nslowly trickle in throughout a year that\nwill attempt to best 2007 which in itself\nwas a most impressive show for the interactive medium.\nThus, myriad questions pop up. With\npretty much the important releases\ncompleted, what can we expect from\nthe Xbox 360? Perhaps the whisperings\nof its successor (yes, MicroSoft can be\nquite daft at times)? Will the PlayStation 3 actually pick up steam or forever\nremain relegated as a brilliant media\nthat also-plays-games-by-the-way?\nAnd what of the Wii? Surely we can expect its inexplicable levels of success to\nwaver... naaah. Whatever it is, it\u2019s quite\nan interesting and maybe even turbulent time that lies in wait for the world\nof gamers. We at Felix Games hope\nto be at the forefront of this storm of\neclecticism and offer our honest, personal opinions as always.\nOh, poop there\u2019s still many more\nlines left. I suppose I should talk about\nthis week\u2019s issue in general. Our Mario\nbonanza last week has spurred the\nAngry Geek into a furore of bitter,\nbitter hatred towards the plump Italian plumber. Deep down inside, he\u2019s\ncounting down the number of stars\nrequired to collect in order to fill the\nheavenly coffers of Galaxy. Also, witness my rusty attempts to draw mug-shots of Mario to attach to his criminal\nrecords, the dirty scoundrel. To nicely\nround off the term\u2019s last issue, I asked\nthe student body what they thought of\nFelix Games for this term. Some of the\nmore senior students were avid readers\nof the previous iteration so it was nice\nto hear their opinions on the transition\nas well. We also present the Reader Riposte regarding the IC Gaming Club.\nWell, that\u2019s all for now folks! Have an\nawesome holiday: Eid, Xmas, et al!\nThis\nWeek\n...pleased? Find out\nPeeved or...\nYou wanna fight, eh? You whored out to ads?\nFlamebait: SMG, STFU\nThe Angry Geek discovers a leak and ends up calling the wrong plumber\nI\nhave had enough of you. All of\nyou. Every single bastard one of\nyou that had the audacity to dedicate four whole pages of Felix,\nalong with every sodding internet messageboard and half of YouTube,\nto Super Mario Galaxy. You\u2019re all going\nto die at the hands of my gaming revo-lution, speared through the neck with\ncopies of Europa Universalis 3. And\nthen I\u2019ll probably get Warren Spector\nto urinate on you or something equally\nde.\nIt\u2019s not merely the fact that it\u2019s Nintendo fanboyism. Because on its own,\nthat would just be mildly amusing and\neasy to ignore, like a bogey hanging\nout of Her Majesty\u2019s nose during her\naddress to the nation. No, what\u2019s really biting at my knackers is the way it\u2019s\nbeing sold; in particular, the most sick-ening, word-of-mouth, self-obsessed,\npseudo orgy I\u2019ve ever seen. VideoGaiden, which relaunched recently with a\ndisappointing first episode, said this\n- \u2018Nintendo have come storming into\nthe greatest year that gaming\u2019s ever\nhad, and taken the gold right at the end\u2019.\nGamePro said that SMG \u2018raises the bar\nin terms of what can be achieved on\nthe Wii\u2019. Play Magazine described it as\n\u2018transcendental\u2019. And every other fucking media outlet made a reference to\nMario64.\nLet\u2019s assess these, shall we? First of\nall, it\u2019s been a relatively good year for\ngaming. PC had some good releases, as\nwell as crippling disappointments. The\nPS3and360continuetounderperform,\nand for some reason no-one\u2019s bored of\nWii Sports yet. I guess you can call that\ngood. To say that Mario Galaxy \u2018takes\nthe gold\u2019, however, is both bizarre and\nentirely unfair. Let\u2019s actually assume\nthat SMG is worth the abhorrent 97%\naverage it\u2019s garnered on MetaCritic.\ncom. To say that it\u2019s a better game than,\nsay, Team Fortress 2 or Call of Duty 4\nis like saying you prefer Red Leicester\nover an evening with Gordon Brown.\nThere is no \u2018gold\u2019 in gaming.\nUnless you\u2019re fucking Nintendo, ap-parently. Thanks, GamePro, for the\nencouraging news on the Wii. Raising\nthe bar for what can be achieved with it\nwouldn\u2019t be particularly hard, though,\nwould it? Seeing as the most innovative release so far has been along the\nlines of, \u201cSwing the remote. Imagine\nyou were swinging a sword, guys! Go\non!\u201d Fuck me. It\u2019s not so much of a bar\nas it is a steel line embedded into the\nground. Mario Galaxy could have had\na minigame where you just fist yourself with the nunchuk for an hour and\nit\u2019d still have beaten the shit out of the\nGoblet of Fire game.\nBut that\u2019s before we get anywhere\nnear the New Games Journalism shits.\nI mean, the guys I\u2019ve described so\nfar were just enthusiastic, but that\u2019s\nnothing compared to the likes of Play\nMagazine, and Edge who had the gall\nto use the word \u2018bravura\u2019 to describe\nit. \u2018Transcendental\u2019? What the fuck\ndoes that even mean in the context of\na game? You still look like a lobotomy\noutpatient swatting a fly when you play\nthe game, and at the end of the day it\u2019s\nstill the same git-faced Italian plumber.\nIt\u2019s not a meditative experience, you\nmorons, it\u2019s a videogame.\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker - it\u2019s not exactly that great, is it? Really, I mean. I\nmean, forget for the minute that you\nfeel honour-bound to be supportive\nevery time Miyamoto so much as farts\nin public. Let\u2019s put that aside for a sec-ond. It\u2019s not really that great. Most of\nthe reviews describe how pretty it is,\nand then begin to beat the shit out\nof games that are far, far prettier and\nfar, far more visually pleasing.

This I did,\nbut after working for two weeks in the\nbaking hot January sun picking grapes\non barely \u00a33/hour I thought it would\nbe better to spend my hard-earned\nmoney there and work harder back in\nthe UK for better wages.\nThe next few weeks involved bussing\nit down the West Coast, which is basically a road that stretches for 500km\naround the mountains without any option of turning off and with a population of around 1,000 spread out over\nthe many small villages. I spent a while\nin the wonderfully named Punakaiki,\nwhich consists of the Pancake Rocks\nand miles of pristine beach, but this\nalso coincided with an excruciating\npain in my hand from a cut I had received a few days earlier. For several\ndays I thought that some exotic insect had laid its eggs in my hand and\nthat they were slowly hatching and\ndevouring me because of the various\nsubstances that seemed to be oozing\nfrom under my skin, but when you are\nseveral hours from the nearest doctor\nand the buses only come a few times a\nweek, you just have to wait for nature\nto take its course.\nEventually I arrived in Hokitika\nwhere a medical student decided to\noperate on my hand and removed large\namounts of gunk from my hand. The\nanaesthetic hurt far more than the procedure itself, so let that be a lesson to\nyou; don\u2019t trust medics.\nI climbed the Fox Glacier (not named\nafter the mints) with an experienced\ntour guide with a group of Japanese\ntourists, but that didn\u2019t stop us getting lost and spending an hour cutting\nour way out of the ice. Luckily I didn\u2019t\nknow at the time about the man who\nhad died the day before from falling\ninto a crevasse, otherwise I may have\nbeen a little more worried.\nThe Milford Track is the most popular walking track in NZ, and bookings\nfor it are like gold dust, but I managed\nto get one by sheer luck. This track is a\nfour-day hike through the mountains,\nstarting with a boat ride across Lake\nTe Anau to the starting point, with\nbasic huts in strategic places along the\nway. The first two days were pretty un-eventful, until we arrived at the second\nhut and the skies opened. We were told\nnot to leave the hut as the bridges had\nbeen washed away and the weather\nwas too bad for the helicopters to rescue us. We spent two days in that hut\nand by the time the weather cleared we\nwere quite happy to move on. Just as\nwe arrived at the third hut, the rains\ncame again and we were stranded for\nanother day, but once we persuaded\nthe rescue teams that we had no food\nleft we were given a short ride over the\nfloods in a little helicopter almost to\nthe end of the track. Once at the end\nof the track we found out that two of\nour party had died on the track while\nwe were there.\nAfter that ordeal I wanted a few quiet\nnights in, but I went to Queenstown,\nthe aptly-named Adventure Capital of\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editors \u2013 Ahran Arnold and Nadine Richards\nThere and back again: A GAP Tale\nTom Culley takes us on a journey to the heart of Middle Earth itself, New Zealand, to tell us about his gap\nyear experience there. If you didn\u2019t take a gap year, and regret it: this is what you missed out on. Unlucky!\nT\nhe country is full of rolling\nhills, rugged coastlines,\nfarmland, beaches and\nlots of small mining towns\nfar from civilisation. English is the official language, but a significant number of people speak their\nown native tongue. The fields are full of\nsheep (44 million in fact) and the place\nnames are mostly incomprehensible.\nNo, this is not Wales. It is in fact\nthe furthest place from Wales without\nleaving Earth. We are, in fact, in New\nZealand.\nTwo years before coming to Imperial\nI decided that I was tired of staying at\nhome in a boring, lonely village in the\nfar north of England and that I wanted\nto get as far away from it as possible.\nNZ is almost exactly opposite the\nUK, and yet I am still amazed at how\nsimilar the two countries are. It almost\nlooks like someone stole all of the most\ninteresting landscapes of Britain, stuck\nthem together like a jigsaw, and added\na few volcanoes just for a laugh. They\neven drive on the left and celebrate the\nQueen\u2019s Birthday (they take a four day\nholiday over it as well, more British\nthan we are...).\nOne article simply is not enough to\ndescribe all that NZ has to offer, so I\nwill have to do my best at picking out\nthe most important parts.\nI arrived just in time for Christmas,\nwhich I spent with some distant relations who lived in Auckland. Sunbathing and barbecues aren\u2019t the first things\nI would choose to do on Christmas\nDay, but what else would you do in the\ncircumstances?\nI took the Overlander train to the\ncapital, Wellington, for the New Year\ncelebrations, but I seriously underestimated the size of the country. Auckland-Wellington took 13 hours (and\nthat\u2019s only the North Island), but once\nthere, I loved the place. It\u2019s one of the\nsmallest capital cities in the world, with\na population of 180,000 in the city it-self, but all the houses are just squashed\ninto any space they could find. Many\nof the more expensive buildings are on\ncliff faces, and have cable cars that lead\nto the front door.\nNext on my trip was Blenheim, on the\n\u201cNo, this is not\nWales. It is, in\nfact, the furthest\nplace from\nWales without\nleaving Earth\u201d\nthe World, and it certainly deserves the\ntitle. Some of the world\u2019s largest bungee jumps are around Queenstown,\nbut I went one better and went on the\nCanyon Swing: a 119m freefall into a\ngorge, hoping that the rope attached\nto your waist will kick in and your life\nwon\u2019t end on the rocks below. It was\nthe single most frightening experience\nof my life, especially as I have a morbid fear of heights. Until I did it again,\nwhich was even scarier because they\nmade me do it backwards. I will admit\nthat I screamed. Very loud. And I\u2019d do\nit again.\nBack on the North Island, I ended\nup in a small village called National\nPark, from where I hoped to walk the\nTongariro Crossing; a gruelling 10-hour hike over two active volcanoes.\nUnfortunately a huge blizzard started,\nwhich trapped me in the hostel for several more days. I eventually tackled the\ntrack, and it was most certainly gru-elling, but definitely rewarding, with\nawesome views from the top of Mt\nNgaurohoe, a.k.a. Mt Doom.\nOnawhimseveraldayslaterIjumped\nout of a plane over Lake Taupo. I was\nattached to a man and a parachute, but\nthat didn\u2019t make it any less worrying.\nFrom 12,000ft we were pushed out and\nfreefell most of the way to the ground\nbefore releasing the canopy, but after\nthe Canyon Swing it was surprisingly\nnot as scary as I had expected. Still, for\n\u00a350 you could do worse for a day out.\nNow, an article about NZ would not\nbe complete without a mention of the\nsingle biggest boost to tourism the\ncountry has seen in recent years; the\nLord of the Rings Trilogy. Many of the\nfilming sites are easily accessible and\nyou can even pay people a lot of money\nto take you on a guided tour of these\nplaces, where you can take photos to\nshow your family and friends that you\nhave in fact stood on the very spot\nfrom which Orlando Bloom fired his\narrow at the Wargs. Even though he\nlives next door to Imperial College and\nyou will probably meet him in the flesh\nin the SAF, but never mind about that.\nThe town of Matamata has certainly\ntaken the opportunity to make a few\ndollars, and provide tours to Hobbiton,\nwhich was built on a sheep-farm a few\nmiles into the countryside. The owners thought that it may be slightly more\nprofitable to let thousands of tourists\npay them to walk on their fields than\nto actually farm sheep on it, and who\nam I to argue?\nIf you ever go to New Zealand; spend\nat least three months there. If you\nhaven\u2019t already taken a gap year, then\nwhen you graduate and are unemployed you will have all the time in the\nworld to find more interesting things\nto do with yourself. If you have taken\na gap year; take another one. You won\u2019t\nregret it. Promise.\nAnyone recognise this?

Everyone\u2019s\nwearing them; girls, boys, men, wom-en, pensioners, everyone. The problem is that skinny jeans are not for\neveryone. That\u2019s why you see people\nwalking down the street looking like\nthey\u2019ve got two overstuffed Sainsbury\u2019s Basics sausages as legs.\nHere at Imperial you don\u2019t see many\npeople in skinny jeans for two rea-sons. Firstly, there\u2019s nothing more\nembarrassing than explaining to your\ntutor you\u2019re late because you fell down\nthe stairs and blacked out struggling\nwith your skinnys, and secondly, the\nnumber of girls walking about is approximately equal to none.\nThe way your jeans are going to\nlook on you depend a lot on your leg\nlength. Tall or short, it\u2019s all about getting the right cut of skinnys. Taller\npeople can pull off skinnys to the way\nthey were designed; no folding from\nwaist to ankle.\nObviously, getting your exact leg\nlength is preferable. However, I\u2019ve\nfound a lot of men\u2019s skinny jeans come\nin set leg lengths, and being a complete shortarse, they\u2019re always too\nlong. This probably doesn\u2019t matter if\nyou have the right cut. Find the tightest (comfort permitting) cut of skin-nys and length becomes irrelevant.A\nlength 34 will look perfectly fine even\nif your real leg length is a 30. The jeans\nwill just crumple around your ankles,\nbut the leg opening will never drag on\nthe ground and get caught under your\nshoes. So never ever trim or hem your\nskinnys, but fold them inwards if you\nhave to. People also fold up their skin-nys outwards as some sort of fashion\nstatement, but honestly, it just reeks\ntoo much of being nine years old\nagain when all you ever wore was your\nbrother\u2019s oversized hand-me-downs.\nAvoid the \u2018slouch\u2019 style of skinny\njeans if you\u2019re of the shorter nature.\nThe cut allows the arse-side to hang\nmuch lower than usual, and without\nlonger legs to balance the slouch hang,\npeople will start wondering what is\nwrong with your odd-shaped legs and\nmost probably offer you their seat on\nthe bus.\nWhether you\u2019re one for the fads, nu-rave, emo, indie, space-age martian, I\ndon\u2019t care, but coloured skinny jeans\nwill not and never will work for you,\nor anyone for that matter. As soon\nas Topman started stocking bright\nred and blue skinny jeans, I thought\nthe local scene-kids in my town were\njoining the circus (not that I thought\nthey didn\u2019t deserve to be a travelling\nfreakshow anyway\u2026). This is nothing to do with the fact the jeans are\nskinny, its just a simple rule of thumb\nthat all men should never break unless\nthey\u2019re going for the annoying-tour-ist-asking-where-the-V&A-is-whenhe\u2019s-right-in-front-of-it look.Jeans in\ncolours other than the usual shades\nof demin, black or grey are a big no-no. People\u2019s attention is immediately\ndiverted towards your legs and away\nfrom your top half (the slightly more\nimportant half in most respects), and\nplus, having another guy frowning\nat anything beyond your waistline is\nnever going to end that well.\nAs a guy, if you\u2019re constantly grabbing your crotch every three seconds\njust to \u201crearrange\u201d your jangly bits,\nfirstly, you look like a pervert. Stop it.\nThere are mothers screaming in ab-horrentdisgustastheirkidswatchyou.\nIt\u2019s because you\u2019re wearing girls jeans,\nor skinnys two sizes too small for you.\nCome on, man up! Do you want to be\nknown as the town fiddler?\nSome people can\u2019t help having love\nhandles, but you\u2019ll be wearing skinny\njeans at your own peril. Whether they\nmake your thighs look slimmer or\nyour calves shapelier, it\u2019s only because\neverything has been shifted upwards\nand skywards into a lovely looking\noverspill called your belly... and back\nto the overstuffed sausage analogy we\ngo.\nCigarette pants, drainpipes, peg leg\npants, pencil pants, slimjims, skinny\njeans; whatever you choose them,\nA badly needed style guide for those with a prediliction for the more restrictive trouser by Daniel Wan\nthey\u2019re in, and they\u2019re probably here\nto stay for quite a while. They\u2019re like\nMarmite, you either love them or hate\nthem, but they\u2019re for your legs; not\nspreading on your toast.\nYou know that you grew up in the 90\u2019s if...\n...you like totally committed these truly heinous crimes against fashion!\nOr any necklace from the goldmine that is Claire\u2019s\nAccessories. Worn as a bunch of three for extra\ncool points.\nhion!\nSlapping these on was strangly satis-fying. Now banned because they\u2019re a\n\u2018safety hazard\u2019. Kids today don\u2019t bleed\nenough.\nJelly bracelets\nSide ponytails\nBumbags\nDemin jackets\nSlap bracelets\nScrunchies\nYing yang necklaces\nNike trainers\nAdidas\nThe only trainers to have. My mother as\na cruel and unusual punishment bought\nme Hi-Teks. Lame. So lame.\nThe anti-glasses, in that it does appear to lower your IQ.\nWorn most stylishly by Deb in Napoleon\nDynamite.\nDon\u2019t even try the two stripe knock-off track-suit. The only highly flammable shellsuit to\nwear was Adidas. Worn by you as a child, and\nmade by children. Ironic.\nThe perfect example of a jarring\nabyss between form and function.\nApparently each colour indicates what sexual\nacts you are willing to perform. Um...I was in\nprimary school when this happened and not\nbeing groomed by a pedophile, so I have entirely innocent memories.\nSo 90\u2019s that at some point they\u2019re inevitably\ngoing to come back. And you\u2019ll have to live\nthrough the depressing moment of having lived\na trend the the first time round. You\u2019re old.\nSadly now more often now seen\nused to hold a croyden facelift.\nOuch. How the hell do you even get in trousers that tight?\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\nFilm\nThe Assassination of Jesse James plods along until its heavenly finale\nMagorium: Why kids enjoy cinema\nHollywood is able to deliver the biggest blockbusters, the best shoot-outs,\nthe most dangerous and mind-numb-ing action scenes, great humour, and,\nif they really try, Hollywood can even\ndo ambitious and serious, for ten hours\nstraight- of course. Very rarely do we\nactually get the chance to come across\na movie whose sole purpose is to make\nyou feel good. Well, now I\u2019ve discovered that those films are played in the\ncinema before 12 o\u2019clock and the mean\nage of the audience is 10. That is, if Mr.\nMagorium\u2019s Wonder Emporium is anything to go by, although I am sadly disposed to believe that this may just be\na special exception due to its fantastic\ncast.\nDustin Hoffman becomes the 243\nyear-old Mr. Magorium in this story of\na magical toy store that rebels against\nbeing passed on to Molly Mahoney, the\nyoung manager played by Natalie Portman. Things only seem to get worse\nwhen Mr. Magorium hires a sceptical\naccountant called Henry (Jason Bateman) to determine the value of the 114\nyear-old \u2018emporium\u2019. After Magorium\u2019s\ndeath, both Molly and Henry need the\nhelp of a young, friendless kid (Zach\nMills) to find the source of magic inside themselves, and to bring the shop\nback to life.\nThe movie could not have had a more\nclich\u00e9d tale to tell. How many films\nhave there been made about the power\nof belief or about never giving up the\ninner child in all of us? How many\nwonderfully eccentric, slightly childish\ncharacters have we been presented to?\nMr. Magorium\u2019s Wonder Emporium is,\non the surface, no different. But where\nthe other films just reek of rehashed\nideas, this one actually manages to\nconvey the magic effectively. Seeing\nthe store come to life on the big screen\nand watching each toy start moving;\nbouncing, singing, dancing, whirling or flying according to its nature is\nmore than enchanting, and every kid\nwill desperately wish that Hamley\u2019s\nhad such power. You start envying the\nlittle tykes for still being young and allowed to fully enjoy scenes like that.\nThe cinematographer\u2019s vibrant use of\ncolour (\u2018colourful\u2019 doesn\u2019t do it justice)\nmirrors the all-embracing sense of optimism that permeates throughout the\nwhole movie and is so typical of Zach\nHelm\u2019s scripts.\nHowever, the most noteworthy feature is the cast. Dustin Hoffman commented on the fact that he was not\ncharacterised to look old, that \u201cif I can\nbelieve that [Magorium] believes [that\nhe is 234 years old] then I have solved\nit\u201d. Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman\nalso understood that the key to making\nthe story plausible was not by acting in\nas realistic and \u2018down-to-earth\u2019 manner\nas possible, but by embracing the magic of the tale and focussing on conveying their character\u2019s belief in the reality\nof the events. At the same time though,\nserious themes like death, unfulfilled\nexpectations and loneliness are dealt\nMr Magorium\u2019s \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nWonder Emporium\nDirector: Zach Helm\nWriter: Zach Helm\nCast: Dustin Hoffman,\nNatalie Portman\nSether\nwith seriously (Magorium even refers\nto Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear). These\nthemes are not made light of for the\nchildren\u2019s sake, neither for that matter,\nis the vocabulary and language made\nany simpler. Some of the words heard\nhere had me reaching for a dictionary\nupon leaving the cinema.\nIn a period of cinema when children\u2019s\nmovies like Shrek and Ice Age have\nbeen popular with all the demographics because of their fairly sophisticated\nhumour and irony never before found\nin films aimed at the young, it is a nice\nsurprise to find a movie which, instead\nof teaching rudeness and sarcasm,\ntries to stir the imagination. The movie\nlacks an appropriately developed ending which is clearly rushed to fit the\nexpected 90 minutes and the story is\nalso relatively predictable with minimal emotional impact. I doubt these\nare causes for concern to the average\nten year old though, and the magic that\nis there is unique enough. Especially at\nChristmas.\nThe Assassination \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nof Jesse James by\nthe Coward Robert Ford\nDirector: Andrew Dominik\nWriter: Andrew Dominik\nCast: Brad Pitt,\nCasey Affleck\nAlex Casey\nThe Western died out when Clint\nEastwood decided he wanted to\nmove behind the camera, and,\nwhilst personal opinion would view\nthis as one evil simply taking the\nform of another, I concede that the\ndeath of the Western is the better\nnews of the two. The odd rebel out\nthere still tries to put new spins\non them however, so much so that\nthese aren\u2019t in fact \u201cWesterns\u201d but\njust films set in the \u2018West\u2019, the Midwest being more accurate probably.\nJesse is of this breed, as was the acclaimed Brokeback Mountain, yet\nboth manage to maintain the central characteristic of their skewed\ngenre \u2013 boredom.\nAs Jesse traipses around the\nwintry Midwest following the departure of his brother Frank from\nthe James boys\u2019 gang, he meets\nthe young Robert Ford, a 19 year\nold who, if this were now, would\nhave big posters of Jesse on his\nwall while he played with the action\nfigure, ate JJ candy and smoked JJ\n-brand cigarettes. The star-struck\nFord sets about trying to impress,\nbut while the trailer would have you\nbelieve this is the central thread to\nthe story, it wavers so much that\nit\u2019s surprising it didn\u2019t get lost down\nsome Missouri river. Beyond this,\nif you know the title, you can see\nwhere it\u2019s going and the character\ndevelopment takes centre stage\nwithout any saloon set-pieces.\nBrad Pitt has the same problem\nstepping into the shoes of Jesse as\nhe has with every role post-Fight\nClub, in that his face is so recognisable (albeit slightly haggered in the\nage of Jolie) that he\u2019s hard to accept as a believable character. It\u2019s\na particularly menopausal James\nthat he evokes here, over the hill\ncareer-wise with a full set of mood\nswings and facial ticks that he\u2019s got\ndown to a tee. Peculiar, however, is\nthat he seems to have ignored the\nexcessive blinking that the narrator\nendows him with in the opening and\nreplaced it with a weird tongue point\nthat looks suited to a particularly\nstrange session of cunnilingus.\nCasey Affleck, on the other hand,\nis perfect as Ford, conjuring up this\nchildlike image of hero-worship\nthat seems to border on a Brokeback-style yearning at various\npoints; perhaps there\u2019s something\nin the water in them there hills.\nThe nuance with which he acts puts\nbonehead brother Ben to shame,\nand the allegation of cowardice in\nboth historical judgement and the\nfilm\u2019s title is twisted into the only\nthing that really lifts Jesse out of\nthe doldrums.\nThe beauty of Affleck\u2019s performance is brightest in the film\u2019s denouement and never, in recent\nmemory at least, has the end of a\nfilm provided such a fitting justification for particularly mediocre\nmeans. The film length is in proportion with its title, and feels all the\nlonger for the seeming lack of direction it takes throughout, yet the\nfinal act succeeds to be enthralling\nin spite of the wavering lead up and\nthe spoiler being right there in the\ntitle. Whilst two hours in to the film\nyou may be shouting \u201cJust bloody\nshoot him!\u201d, the last half hour finds\nfirm standing away from the earlier\ncinematography that, whilst beautiful in places, frequently segues\n(intentionally) into that blurred\nshot resembling the view through\ncondensation covered glasses worn\nfresh out the shower.\nThe film is a gamble: if you think\nyou can stick out the rough beginnings (and be glad it isn\u2019t in the original four hour edit), then it might\npay off. What remains is certainly\nThis Christmas, Mr Magorium inspires finding time to delve back into the treasure chest of your inner child\nnot a piece of groundbreaking cin-ema, but a story of real character,\none that goes beyond the legends of\nthe title. The narrator at one point\nprofesses that no books or eulogies\nwere ever written for Robert Ford,\nbut in essence that is exactly what\nwe have here. Tragically, its realism\nisn\u2019t too arresting.\nA wonderful man: Mr Magorium, no less\nGreat, I spend two and a half hours just waiting to get assassinated. Trade anyone?\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14 felix Friday 7 December 2007\nPolitics\nPolitics Editor \u2013 Li-Teck Lau\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\nW\nith the comments\nand politics sections of this paper\nfilled with discussions and debates\nabout the USA, Iraq, Afghanistan,\nMiddle East worries, religion and likes\nof such, I thought that this paper could\nuse a new issue to debate about, and\ngiven the composition of the university\npopulation, I can see potential in bringing up an issue close to many people\u2019s\nheart. The Taiwan-China issue.\nThere I said it. The poignant point\nthat some of us are careful to tread\naround, and also an issue that most are\nblatantly ignorant and unaware about.\nConsider the following issues: are you\naware that on the other side of this\nplanet, there is an informal war that\nhas dragged on for more than 50 years,\nother than North and South Korea,\nand has been evaluated to be a potential trigger point for World War III?\nDid you know that your countries\u2019\nleaders (Bush, Brown, Sarkozy, Putin)\ndon\u2019t recognize Taiwan as a country\n(as much as Palestine), despite the general public identifying the Taiwan as a\n\u2018country\u2019?\nEver wondered why in the international events, like the Olympics and\nWorld Baseball Cup, there\u2019s a team\nnamed \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d?\nWhy there is such a big fuss on Facebook with names like \u201cFuck! There is\nonly one CHINA, Taiwan will be one\npart of CHINA forever\u201d\nThese ridiculous facts come from a\nintriguing incident on what happened\nto China after the second world war,\nwhich has been overshadowed in the\nWest by the Cold War. Ok let me set\nthe scene here for you. It\u2019s 1945, the\nRepublic of China, just crawled it\u2019s way\nout of the ravages which the Japanese\nbrought on in Asia, the economy\u2019s in\na disastrous state, the government can\nonly console themselves with having\nstuck with the winning side of the War,\nin which Japan ceded/returned the island of Taiwan back to the Chinese.\nThe government now has a prominent\npermanent seat on the UN, which it\nfounded.\nHowever, there is change going on\ninside China, the government is losing touch with the peasant commu-nity, who are gradually looking toward\nCommunism as a solution to their disastrous state (eight years of war, plus\nwidening wealth gap and bad govern-ment). From there starts another war\n\u2013 the Chinese civil war, which results\nin the National government receding\nto the island of Taiwan with the lead of\nChiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek relocates the government temporarily in\nTaipei, vowing to liberate the Mainland\nin the future. Meanwhile Mao Zhedong establishes the People\u2019s Republic\nof China, vowing to liberate Taiwan in\nthe future. This is 1949.\nPolitically the deadlock has been\nthere since, now Communist China\nstates that Taiwan is a rebel province\nthat it will reunify in the future by all\nmeans, hence the 800 or so missiles\npointing at Taipei. And the constitution of the Republic of China (now on,\nand commonly referred as, Taiwan)\nstill claims it\u2019s boundaries to include\nthe Mainland, with Nanjing as it\u2019s capi-tal. The independence camp on Taiwan would like that change to reflect\nthe reality, but China states that would\nbe seen as an act of the declaration of\nindependence which will trigger war.\nSo the saber-rattling goes on.\nAn anonymous commentary on Taiwan\u2019s place in the international community\nTaiwan: not quite a country\nPresident Hu of the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China is committed to a one\nChina\nChina threatens that any declaration of independance by the rogue province of Taiwan will lead to military intervention\nThe Taiwanese population doesn\u2019t\nwant war. But they don\u2019t want to be\n\u2018part of China\u2019 \u2013 communism or the\ngoverning style in China just doesn\u2019t\nappeal to the democracy indulged\nTaiwanese. Despite being ethnically\nChinese, they feel a detachment to the\nChina across the straits, with a different writing system, and culture revolu-tion, and most prominently the hostile\nthreats and bullying that China issues\non a regularly basis. Last Olympics, the\nChinese Taipei Team (naming forced\nupon the IOC by China) won their first\ngold medal, but they weren\u2019t allowed\nto play nor display their \u2018national\u2019 flag\nnor anthem. The 23 million people of\nTaiwan (greater than the population\nof Australia) aren\u2019t affiliated to the\nWorld Health Organization, so during the SARS influenza, were outside\nthe WHO monitoring system. And of\ncourse they\u2019re not represented in the\nUN.\nSince 1979, when Nixon normalised\nrelations with China to \u2018help ease international tensions\u2019 (Big market? Iraq\nand oil is only a repetition of history),\ncountries willing to recognise China,\nhad to un-recognise the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, basically saying,\n\u201cyou can only be friends with me or\nhim, not both - if you are not with us\nyou\u2019re against us\u201d. Hence UK doesn\u2019t\nofficially see Taiwan independent enti-ty, where many of us would understand\ndifferently.\nAs the economic importance and\nmilitary muscle of China grows, it\nwould be interesting to see how this\nthorny issue is resolved. As the nationalism sentiment grows with the economy of China, most Chinese will fervently defend China\u2019s claim of Taiwan,\nas fiercely as they claim Tibet. Ask any\nChinese person around you to get their\nview! Or a Taiwanese for that matter!\n\u201cTaiwan is an inalienable part of\nChina\u2019s territory. The greatest threat\nto peace in the Taiwan Straits is from\nthe separatist activities by the \u201cTaiwan\nindependence\u201d forces.\u201d Chinese President Hu Jintao, 2003.\nT\nhere\u2019s a whole Jonswop\nspectrum of news filling\nthese two pages this week,\nfrom domestic debates\nover freedom of speech at\nuniversity unions to anonymous commentary on the history of the Taiwan\nstraits issue, to, well, blasphemy in\nAfrica.\nThe White House looked red faced\nas the government in Iran welcomed a\nnew American Intelligence report concluding not only that there is no evidence the Middle Eastern nation has\nintentions of developing nuclear weap-ons, but that it would be able to do so\nuntil at least 2010. This runs contradictory to the President\u2019s line that Iran\nposes a very real and present danger to\ninternational security.\n16 people have been killed in clashes in Kenya running up to December\nelections in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\nPresident Mwai Kibaki is seeking reelection but is neck and neck in the\npolls with rival Raila Odinga. Party rallies have been marred by violence.\nEight were shot dead in the American state of Nebraska in a busy shopping mall as the festive shopping season gets truly underway. The 19 year\nold gunman rampaged through the\nisles wounding five others before turning the gun on himself. This is the third\nhigh profile gun mass murder in the\ncountry this year.\nPresident Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation has an approval rating\nof 70% according to a new independent\nopinion poll. Putin, who is unable to\nrun for a third term as president, will\ninstead lead the United Russia Party\nby standing in the coming elections\nfor the role of Prime Minister. 22% of\nthose surveyed felt it would be a positive move should Mr Putin attempt to\nchange the constitution.\nFinally, Knut, the celebrity polar bear\nand most famous resident of Berlin\nZoo, celebrated his first birthday this\nweek. The little fur ball had received\ndeath threats from animal rights campaigners who claimed that he should\nnot have survived when his mother\nwas killed in natural circumstances.\nHowever the old time dimension\nthings works, where I am, it\u2019s really early in the morning, so good bye\nfrom Felix Politics and merry secular\nChristmas.\nKnut the polar bear is 1 year old\n\n"

It is in fact originally a British treat, so big up to\nthe Land of Crumpets. The main\ndifferences between the two versions is that the former is served\nwarm and has a weak gel texture,\nwhereas the latter is served cold\nwith a texture closer to scrambled egg.\nEither way, the custard tart\nseems to be a forgotten treat in\nthis country. The Hong Kong version is quite easy to make \u2013 the\nonly annoying part is shaping the\npastry bases, but you can always\nget help. You may struggle to find\nevaporated milk (note: not the\nsame as condensed milk!) in the\nsmall supermarkets; the big ones\nwill always have them in tins. If\nyou really can\u2019t find any, normal\nfresh milk is fine.\nBeing a British pastry original-ly, it is no surprise that this treat\ngoes very well with English tea.\nFor the record, you can also try\nevaporated milk with tea \u2013 it really does taste better than using\nordinary milk. So here it is: a perfect afternoon tea in Hong Kong!\nTools:\n\u2022 Electric oven (190 \u00b0C)\n\u2022 Fridge\n\u2022 Scale\n\u2022 Sieve\n\u2022 Tart tray or metallic tart cups\n(I use a 3\u201d [d] x1.25\u201d [h] hole x12\ntray)\n\u2022 Egg beater/fork\n\u2022 Tart paper cups (optional)\nIngredients (Serves 12)\nFor the pastry:\n\u2022 Salted Butter - 280g\n\u2022 Fine sugar - 105g\n\u2022 Egg yolk \u2013 x4\n\u2022 Evaporated milk - 60g\n\u2022 Flour - 470g\nCustard Tarts\nRichard Lai\n\u2022 Vanilla essence - 6 drops\nFor the filling:\n\u2022 Warm water - 225g\n\u2022 Eggs - x3\n\u2022 Evaporated milk - 60g\n\u2022 Fine sugar - 75g\n\u2022 Vanilla essence - 3 drops\nInstructions\n1. Pastry: mix butter and sugar,\nand then mix in egg yolk. Beat until\nsmooth\n2. Add milk and vanilla essence,\nand then sift flour, work dough\n3. Chill dough in fridge for 15\nminutes\n4. Split dough into 12 balls, and\nflatten each into tray (make it at\nleast 4mm thick, and make the bottom inner edge fairly sharp so that\nthere is more space for the filling,\nas well as not wasting any dough).\n5. Pierce 3 holes at the bottom\nof each pastry base, and then chill\nthem for 15 minutes\n6. Preheat oven to 190 \u00b0C for\nlater use\n7. Filling: mix sugar into\nwarm water until dissolved, and\nthen let it cool to room temperature (CRUCIAL!)\n8. Strain eggs through\na sieve, and whisk into sugar\nsolution\n9. Stir in milk and vanilla\n10. Strain final mixture\nthrough a sieve, and fill up the\neach pastry base with it\n11. Bake for at least 25 min-utes, or until the filling is set\n12. Enjoy the warm custard\ntarts!\nTarts as far as the eye can see. Did someone say obesity? Bring it on!\nT\nuesday night saw the\nlaunch of the new partnership between Gourmet\nBurger Kitchen and Laverstoke Farm Park, which\naims to create a new premier range\non their menu. Purely in the name\nof research, Felix writers Alex Casey\nand Sally Longstaff went along to the\nlaunch party to find out more.\nAmongst the more interesting names\non the menu were the Laverstoke Buffalo Burger (\u00a39.95) and the Laverstoke\nOrganic Wild Boar Burger (\u00a38.95),\nboth of which were sweetly packaged\nin bitesize baps. Whilst the Buffalo\nwas not unlike beef, but perhaps with a\nslightly stronger, more smokey flavour,\ncomplemented well by the onions and\ngarlic, the Boar Burger, which is certified organic, tasted quite like a nice\npork sausage. The zingy mayonnaise\nalso added something to each, but\nequally appetizing was the spicy redcurrant sauce on offer, teaming up well\nwith the flavours.\nWhilst both are slightly more expensive than most of the burgers on offer\nat GBK, generally falling in the range of\nabout \u00a36-\u00a37, the quality and adventure\nare well worth the price in the opinion\nof these reporters, and certainly within\nthe grasp of a student budget!\nGBK started in the UK in 2001 and\nhave a well-deserved reputation for\nhigh quality food. Their philosophy\nabout \u201cproduce, handled and prepared\nwith care to produce exceptionally\nfresh and delicious food\u201d is certainly\ncarried through into the restaurants\nthemselves, where each burger is made\nto order.\nThe new links with Laverstoke Farm,\nowned by 1979 Formula One Champion Jody Scheckter, are descibed as\n\u201cvery exciting\u201d by Davis Sykes, Managing Director of GBK. He says \u201cWe are\nconfident that the two new additions\nwill prove popular with burger lovers,\nas it gives them the opportunity to be\nadventurous and try something very\ndifferent\u201d.\nLaverstoke Farm Park\u2019s approach to\nfarming is a very different one to traditional farming, involving a Soil Lab in\norder to monitor the biology in the soil,\na 5 acre compost site for fertiliser, and\npastures for the animals containing 31\ndifferent herbs, clovers and grasses. It\nis little wonder then that the farm was\nawarded Best UK Food by the Taste of\nBritain awards, run by The Telegraph\nand Sainsbury\u2019s. Jody Scheckter describes his aims for the farm as \u201c...[to]\nproduce the best-tasting healthiest\nfood, without compromise\u201d. Having\ntasted the meat on offer last night, in\nthis writer\u2019s opinion, he has produced\nsome of the tastiest meat in the UK!\nThe event to mark this landmark\npartnership was held at the St Paul\u2019s\nGBK. The service was excellent, especially the free champagne that flowed\nwith alarming regularity. The burgers\nwere fresh and hot, and included some\nother burgers from GBK\u2019s extensive\nrange.\nThe vegetarian \u201cburgers\u201d, were also\nvery nice, although the neon green of\nthe falafel burger was hard to get past\ninitially. Also on offer were mounds of\nfresh fruit, bread and cheese. It was a\ntruly excellent evening culminating in\nspeeches by both David Sykes and Jody\nScheckter, with the raffle drawn by another former Formula One Champion,\nDamon Hill.\nThe restaurant itself, like many in the\nGBK range, took its decor as seriously\nas its menu, especially in comparison\nwith the wealth of identical burger\nchains on the high street. It continues\nto provide a welcoming and high quality ambiance, in addition to its excellent\nfood, whilst not being stuffy, pretentious or over-priced. Well worth a\nvisit!\nThe nearest Gourmet Burger\nKitchens to the South\nKensington Campus can be\nfound on the Old Brompton\nRoad and the Fulham\nBroadway. Prices start at \u00a35.65,\nbeer from \u00a32.95, soft drinks\nfrom \u00a31.85 and milkshakes from\n\u00a33.25.\nThe Fulham branch of GBK and a preview of what can be expected\n31\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\n\n"

    "content": "4 felix Friday 7 December 2007\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews\nOne year and two weeks after Imperial College Union voted to affiliate to\nthe National Union of Students (NUS),\nthe national organisation has voted\nin favour of one of the most dramatic\nreforms that it has ever seen. The Extraordinary Conference held on Tuesday controversially decided to accept\nthe motion to delete its constitution in\nits entirety, and totally replace the current structure.\nThe emergency conference was convened solely to debate this reform,\nbacked by Student Unions across the\ncountry (including ICU) who have become frustrated and disenfranchised\nby the National union\u2019s perceived lack\nof relevance, disorganisation, bureauc-racy, and nonsensical radicalism. It\nfaced fierce opposition from those\nwho feared the restructuring would:\n\u201ccorporatise\u201d the NUS, prevent de-mocracy, reduce diversity, and destroy\nits student focus.\nThis radical reform is of particular relevance to IC students since last\nyear\u2019s referendum decision to affiliate\nwas closely fought and full of contro-versy, and ICU has been one of the\nstrongest voices calling for change.\nICU has had a rocky relationship with\nthe NUS since its formation. A Founding Member in 1922, it left the national\nunion only a year after its birth, and\nsince then has briefly rejoined then\nabruptly left at least twice.\nFollowing the departure from the\nUniversity of London Union (ULU),\nIC students last year voted 53% to 47%\nin favour of re-affiliating: an extremely\nslim majority. Felix\u2019s recent investigation into student opinion showed\nthat the effects of joining have passed\nlargely unnoticed, and that uptake\nof the NUS Extra Card has been extremely low amongst both freshers and\nstudents who were eligible to vote last\nyear: only 5% of the total student body\nhave purchased the \u00a310 card.\nMany students questioned the value\nfor money of our \u00a344,000 per annum\naffiliation costs last November, and\nhave continued to do so since the\nreferendum.\nICU therefore threatened yet another disaffiliation if radical changes to\nthe NUS were not made, a threat also\nmade by several other student unions\nsuch as King\u2019s College London Union\n(KCLU). Due to this widespread dissatisfaction in the NUS, a far-reaching\n\u201cGovernance Review\u201d was ordered at\n2007\u2019s annual NUS Conference. The\nreview suggested that a complete overhaul of the entire NUS constitution\nwas necessary, and recommended a\nnew constitution, and a new governance structure almost identical to the\nmodel adopted by ICU and KCLU,\nwith a board of trustees acting as a legal and financial overseer.\nThese new measures have outraged\nmany of the more radical elements of\nthe national union.\nRob Owen, a member of the NUS\u2019\nNational Executive Committee (NEC),\nhas stated that the proposals would\nmean the: \u201cremoving of the NUS\u2019 own\ndemocratic structures,\u201d which would:\n\u201creceive far less independent scrutiny.\u201d\nWhilst the majority of the 27 NEC\nmembers were happy with the changes\nthat had been drafted.\nThe president of Imperial College\nUnion, Stephen Brown, spoke in general defence of the motion in a speech\nthat was brutally honest, and provoca-tive. \u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that the self-styled\n\u2018radicals\u2019 of the student movement\nare steadfast in their determination\nnot to change anything, ever, with regards to NUS governance?\u201d he began,\ncontinuing to say that the image of the\nNUS \u201cpresented to the public is one of\nrebels without a clue, squabbling about\nwhether the revolution should come\non Thursday, or whether it would be\nbetter to wait until the next full moon.\u201d\nIt was a call to arms for those whose\npatience with the current NUS had\ncome to an end.\nIt took six hours of heated debate\nover amendments to the new consti-tution, including multiple attempts to\ntear up the proposal and start all over\nagain, until the Extraordinary Conference tired of waiting and voted 383 to\n181 in favour of an immediate vote on\nthe whole document.\nThe vote for the change came quickly\nand was overwhelmingly in favour, but\nwas taken twice to appease those who\nremained unhappy with the restruc-turing, and the meeting as a whole (a\nvote of no-confidence in the Chair was\nswiftly swept aside prior to the vote).\nAfter years of attempting reform at\nall levels in order to remain relevant\nto the students that it represents, the\nNUS finally reached a consensus that\nThe Extraordinary Conference:\nOpinions of the News Editor\nI\nhad never attended any event even remotely tied to the NUS, but I had\nheard much argument over the national union\u2019s various strengths and\nweaknesses since last autumn. I thought that with that experience, and\nmy open-minded but well informed approach to the Extraordinary\nConference, would prepare me for a \u201cnon-stop governance debate\nfest,\u201d in the UK\u2019s foremost political organisation for students. How wrong\nI was.\nPrior to the event, it was easy for me to add a pinch of salt to any opinions\nthat I heard from members of our own Union, the most vocal of which have\nalways been from those with significant political interests: various people\nwith significantly right, or left-leaning views. I had always assumed that\nthese peoples accusations of \u201cridiculous far-laft factionism,\u201d political inad-equacies, and \u201ccomedy sideshow\u201d-ism were exaggerated by frustrations with\npolitical views that were not their own. Again, I found myself to be the naive\nparty. I tried to leave my own political views at the door in order to report the\nproceedings totally without bias. I failed.\nBefore I had even left the minibus, I read clauses in the new constitution,\na constitution that has been accused of being \u201cundemocratic,\u201d and \u201ca significant lurch to the right,\u201d that made me so angry that I was tempted to address\nthe conference myself in one of the many \u201cfree\u201d speeches on offer to anyone\nwho raised their hand. A response was provoked that required me to physically sit on my hands and fume in incandescent rage, as I watched whilst the\nvast majority of the conference gave standing ovations to odious rhetoric that\nused strong emotions to overwhelm well-reasoned debate. The issue that I\nspeak of is important, but as it involves the BNP, freedom of speech, and\nphilosophical debate, I won\u2019t subject readers to more comment on these recently saturated subjects.\nThe incident, however, was symbolic for me. The rest of the day was filled\nwith petty personal vendettas, childish squabbling, sly manipulation and\nbrief, rare, but extremely welcome outbursts of genuine debate over the future of an organisation that should be important.\nEven in its moment of reform and frustrated consensus, the NUS managed\nto be hamstrung for most of the proceedings by its own members (on both\nsides of the current debate), who believe they are saving the institution from\nevil, but are in fact delivering it further into the hands of irrelevance with\neach minute of ill-reasoned speech. The only reason that any progress was\nmade in the end, was because the majority of delegates wanted to go home,\nand the leadership\u2019s determination and sly tactics galvanised the conference\u2019s\nneed for more action and less talk.\nTo my eyes, the rumours are all true. The NUS is in severe trouble, with an\nalienated student body, and a general loss of confidence in the movement. If\nthe new measures work, a new dawn is imminent. If they do not, the course\nof salvation is even harder to see. It really seems as simple as that.\nHuge NUS reforms; divided opinion\nFelix attends the Extraordinary General Conference, and perhaps witnesses the birth of a new kind of NUS\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\nallows it to radically change the way\nthat it operates. It now can either ratify\nthis constitution at the Congress in\nApril, or reject it and begin the process again.\nObserving whether the current reforms improve, damage, or fail to effectively alter the NUS will be a crucial\npoint of interest for all students in the\nUK and Ireland over the next few years,\nduring which they will face issues such\nas the student funding debate, devaluing degrees, increases in top-up fees,\nand the continuing influence of business over education in general.\nThe NUS will have to return to\nstrength in order to effectively voice\nstudent opinion to the government,\nmedia and major organisations. These\nwill be the acid tests for the NUS, deciding whether IC students decide to\nstay NUS-affiliated, and governing the\nfates of all UK and Irish students in\ngeneral.\nThe next NUS Annual Congress\nwill be held in Blackpool from 1-3\nApril 2008.

The complete restructuring\n(pictured) is designed to combat this decline.\n\n"

Y\u2019know, Christmas\nMerry Hoban\nMusic Elf\nC\nhristmas is meant to be\na giving and caring time\nof year and it probably\nis. However, amongst all\nthe loving, giving and\ncaring, Christmas can be a lonely time\nfor those who are not recipients of all\nthe above. I dedicate my music page to\nthose who for every Christmas, there\nare feelings of vulnerability, loneliness\nand fear.\nI know what you are thinking now:\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Matty starting his festive page\nwith too much of a hint of depression?\u201d\nWell, if you are not a realist then yes, I\nam being a bit heavy.\nEveryone knows that Christmas is\nreally an excuse for people to get a\nbreak from working so hard to be able\nto afford to buy presents for that day\noff. Such cyclical constructs plague our\nyear but I wouldn\u2019t want Christmas\ntaken away from me.\nChristians rightly want to put the\nfocus back on the day being about the\nbirth of Jesus Christ. Credit when it is\ndue, there would be no overdosing on\nturkey if they didn\u2019t take over a Pagan\nfestival and make it about a baby. To\nthose who are non-religious, how do\nyou put meaning back into the day?\nWell, in my opinion I think Christmas\nis there for us to reflect on how really\nhorrible we are as human beings and\nwe can take one day out of the year\nand just generally \u2018relax\u2019 and not care if\nyour brother slept with your girlfriend\nor your dog just ate your granddad\u2019s\nCartier watch (that was a tough year).\nAlso, in the spirit of reflection we then\nconvince ourselves we will be better\npeople next year. So in essence, the festive season is about self-loathing and\nhope; hope that we one day will not\nloathe ourselves. So when you are out\nChristmas shopping, have a little think\nabout that and STOP GETTING IN\nMY FUCKING WAY!\nAnyway, music, ain\u2019t it swell? I think\nswell is a great word and people should\nuse it more often. So, I decided to jump\non the bandwagon (have you ever seen\na bandwagon?) and list my top 10\nChristmas songs, but I avoided the\nobvious Slade and Cliff Richard aiming more for songs that have represent\nthe emotional impact that Noel has;\nthe songs represent being lonely on\nChristmas, desperation to resolve bad\nrelationships for the sake of the joyous season, vulnerability and the pain\nof nostalgia. It is all very well scream-ing, \u201cIt\u2019s CHRISTMASSSSSSSSSSS!\u201d\nBut at the end you are an unchanged\nhuman being. A great Christmas song\nshould make you realise how fragile\nhuman relationships are and that we\nare really nothing and all we have is our\ntime together. Well, that\u2019s what I think\nanyway.\nIf you do one thing this Christmas,\nmake sure you tell someone who you\nfeel about them; whether it is a hobo\nyou trip over on Christmas Eve or your\nsignificant other, or perhaps even your\nparents, someone needs to know that\nyou are nothing without them. Lastly, I\nwish you all a very merry Christmas.\n1\nDarlene Love\nChristmas (Baby, Please\nCome Home)\n5\nEast 17\nStay Another Day\n2\nPogues\nFairytale of New York\n4\nElvis Presley\nBlue Christmas\n3\nBand Aid\nDo They Know It\u2019s\nChristmas\n6\nMud\nLonely This Christmas\n10\nMariah Carey\nAll I Want For Christmas\nIs You\n7\nBing Crosby\nWhite Christmas\n9\nVarious Artists\nSanta Claus Is Coming\nTo Town\n8\nWham!\nLast Christmas\nThis song is very much an American\nphenomenon and is probably not that\nwell-known over here but it is my favourite Christmas song.\nIt considers of an insistent repetition\nof \u201cChristmas\u201d moving up through the\nchords whilst Darlene sings over the\ntop with an urgent, desperate melan-choly. The only thing that saves the\nsong from collapsing in a hopeless mess\nis a saxophone solo which sprouts into\nexistence around three quarters of the\nway in.\nThe one thing that makes this song so\nirresistable is the Phil Spector production (I know he is trigger happy but he\ncan sure construct a wall of pure joyous sound). LIberal use of sleigh-bells\nmay seem incredibly cliche, but since\nSpector used an immense amount\nof percussion on everything it\nonly serves the song well.\nYou will be jumping up and\ndown to the starkest and most\nmournful lyrics around.\nMore of an obvious choice, this. However, even if you are not a fan of traditional Irish folk being fused with punk,\nyou can relate to this ballad. This song\nis basically the musical version of Requiem For A Dream but with a waltz-time backing; it starts with hope and\nthe American Dream and the dream\nends in a haze of addiction and self-destruction. How this became such a\nhuge hit is probably due to its epic and\nswaying quality rather than its devotion to realism.\nSomehow it is not properly Christmas without this song being piped out\nof every supermarket, pub and mobile\nphone. I\u2019m sure those who are fans of\nirony will somehow enjoy (if people\nwho rejoice in irony do enjoy anything)\nhow one of the biggest Christmas anthems is about the destruction of all\nthat is good and full of hope in the\nworld. I think this song is very much\nhow fragile and vulnerable everybody\nis and everyone can relate to that.\n\u201cWell, tonight thank God it\u2019s them instead of youuuuuuu!\u201d Bono memorably wailed whilst 30 bad haircuts stood\naround \u2018changing the world\u2019 the cynic\nin you might say. Regardless of how\nyou stand with regards to the hideous\nsight of 80s pop stars becoming philanthropists for a day, you can appreciate\nthat in the Muslim majority of Africa,\nthere will be no Christmas.\nWhat I think this song really represents is the death of Christmas\nas belonging to the Victorian age of\nmoralism. The 80s became about in-dividualism, materialism and aesthetics and Band Aid were trying to delve\nback into the heart of man to come out\nand help those who need it; a worthy\ncause by any means. However, by making Christmas a world-wide event by\napplying it Africa, they destroyed the\ncosy image of the Victorian Christmas\nand showed that the only good spending money can do is if it helps others.\nBeforeEiffel65camealongandclaimed\nthe colour blue in the name of Europop, blue used to mean something.\nAside from originally representing the\nhardships that the freed slaves endured\nin an economically unstable time, blue\nwas something everybody could unite\naround: a feeling of melancholy whilst\nsomething out of your control was\nkeeping you that way.\nIn the case of Mr. Presley, his lady\nfriend\u2019s departure is what kept him\ndown and stopped him from enjoying the season. Despite the warmth of\nthe reds and greens of Christmas, that\nother primary colour, blue is all he can\nsee. I particularly enjoy this simple im-agery, because loss is a simple idea that\nso many of us can unite behind and reflect on our own blue holidays.\nWhilst technically not a song about\nChristmas, it was still a Christmas\nnumber one and that is the only justification that I need. Whilst being a typically cheesey song from another boy\nband, I actually think the melody of the\nverse is very poignant. Also, it shows\nthat no matter how hard the exterior,\nwe can all feel hurt and longing, especially in the Winter season. That and\nyou can croon this whilst drunk.\nWhat I find extraordinary about this\nsong is the fact that it was put out\nabout 20 years after the sound they\nexhibit was fashionable. Despite this\nbeing a Christmas song that\nElvis should have performed,\nits cartoonish nature does\nnot completely detract from\nthe timeless issue of being\nlonely at Christmas. I think\nto put this song\nin any more of a\nmodern setting\nwould destroy\nthe warmth of\nthe song.\nI know you\nare thinking that\nthe\nspoken\nword bit\nis pure cheese,\nand to some extent, I\nagree, the years of listening to awful indie bands has hardened me. However,\nthose \u2018bum bum bum\u2019s just thaw out\nany residing inner icicles.\nNostalgia is a pretty crippling thing,\nyou grow tired of anything new because\nyou feel alienated by these new movements that have no bearing on your\nway of life. When I listening to Bing,\nI hear not a yearning for snow, but an\nend to his isolation from modernism\nand a return to the Christmases he\nused to know.\nI also personally feel a certain\namount of nostalgia to the Christmases of my childhood where all\nmy brothers would be there before\nthey all went off and got married\nor involved.\nTo many this song is wishful\nthinking since it never snows,\nbut it is more an appeal to\nour inner child.\nWham!\u2019s sing-along classic\nis about deception and resentment\nwhilst coming off as quite remote,\npossibly to avoid George Michael\u2019s\nhidden homosexuality by being gender\nspecific. This song more than anything\ndeals with vulnerability associated\nwith the true gifts that we exchange at\nChristmas ie. that human-Dalek mask\nI want.\nThis song superficially deals with a\nmyth in the form of Santa but really\ndeals in fear and judgement. It also\ndeals with coming of age and reaching\nbeyond your black and white child-like\nvision of reality. This man, whether it is\nSanta or God is the ultimate judge and\nhe knows whether you have been evil\nor good and will reward you accord-ingly. Once you realise that life is not\nthat simple, this song becomes a joke\nor novelty.\nEveryonetellsmethisisthebestChristmas song, but I don\u2019t agree in any way.\nIn terms of vocal performance. Mariah can sing and she likes to let you\nknow about it, but is so professionally\nexecuted she just sounds like a shopping centre. I literally think of shopping centres when I hear this song. It\nis unavoidable for me to hear anything\nelse and what is very melancholy about\nthis song is how vacuous\nit is. Songs like this reduce Christmas to a\nnothing and that is\ndepressing.\n35\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\n\n"

One possible suggestion is that, after making The Golden Compass, Chris Weitz decided the\noriginal title might require some explanation and perhaps plot, a feature that\nisn\u2019t particularly prevalent in this limp\nchildren\u2019s adventure. Whilst not having\nread the book, I was under the impression that the whole appeal, at least for\nan older audience, was that it worked\non both adult and child levels. The film\nsadly sacrifices the first of these for the\nsecond and so lays itself wide open to\ncriticism of dumbing down and general laziness.\nBut all of these complaints will be\nknown to Phillip Pullman fans already.\nFor those uninitiated in the world that\nPhilip Pullman created in the His Dark\nMaterials trilogy, this is the story of\nthe orphan Lyra who lives in a world\nwhere everyone\u2019s soul walks alongside\nthem in animal form, known as a dae-mon. When the mardy youngster tries\nto venture away from her home in an\nOxford college however, she is given a\ngolden compass capable of answering\nany question. This doesn\u2019t sit well with\nthe Magisterium, the all-controlling organisation which is desperately trying\nto ensure scientific truth doesn\u2019t edge\nout the beliefs they feed to the world.\nWhilst the books frame this as an allegory for religion, the film decided to\nNo amount of literary guidance is enough to show The Golden Compass the way\nmove away from that angle to avoid the\nassociated controversy but you don\u2019t\nhave to be an Imperial student to draw\nparallels between them.\nIt\u2019s hard to set up a fantasy land in\na manner that is both succinct enough\nto allow room for plot whilst still inviting wonder from an audience, and it is\nInspired by the famous scandal of\ncorruption and embezzlement in a\nFrench state-owned company, Elf\nAquitaine, and by the ballsy female\njudge that discovered and investigated\nthe case, Claude Chabrol has directed\na movie in which he tries to examine\nthe psychological state of the people\ninvolved in such an affair. The director\u2019s attempt is only achieved thanks\nto the opportune decision to entrust\nthe lead role of the fiery judge (Jeanne\nCharmant-Killman) to Isabelle Huppert, a French actress with whom\nChabrol has already collaborated with\nsix times in the past.\nIt is due to this actress that the film\ndoesn\u2019t simply stay a boring story\nabout the procedures of prosecuting\nupper echelon crooks but turns into\na captivating study of character. Not\nonly does Jeanne Charmant-Killman\nfight against the debauched business-men, but also with the surprisingly\nchauvinistic world of law and politics\nand even the general public.\nAs her investigation starts probing\never higher levels of the company and\nthe government, Jeanne\u2019s exhilaration\nwith power flourishes. Meanwhile,\nher marriage and personal life become\nthe victims of the addictive race for\nmore authority, a pursuance which\nshe doesn\u2019t stop even when her life is\nthreatened.\nIsabelle Huppert is striking in her\npart. She has created a character that is\nimpossible to \u2018crack open\u2019 while being\nperfectly transparent at the same time;\nwe never know what Jeanne is think-ing, but we always know what is driving her and exactly what she wants.\nThis gives the movie a certain quality\nof inscrutability which effectively rubs\nout the sense of blandness evoked by\nthe lack of action in the story.\nThe rather dark air of the film is\nseamlesslydeepenedbyEudardoSerra\u2019s\ncinematography. The high-ceilinged,\nspacious apartment of Jeanne and\nMonsieur Jeanne Charmant-Killman\n(the sarcastic name given to the judge\u2019s\nhusband by his colleagues), is always\nshown in shades of blue and grey and\nis one of the more uninviting places\nI have seen. The scenes in this cold\nSether\nN\now that we\u2019ve got the\nChristmas blockbuster\n(The Golden Compass)\nout of the way for the\nyear, we can officially\nherald the beginning of the festive\nseason. In place of the much loved but\nsadly departed \u2018Holidays are Coming\u2019\nCoca-Cola ads that used to mark the\nbeginning of this happy time, we now\nget another CGI heavy fantasy yarn\nchucked to the salivating fanboys (and\ngirls) that signals the rest of us can now\nlegally occupy ourselves with endless\nrounds of Fairytale of New York and Do\nThey Know It\u2019s Christmas, mountains\nof mince pies and lashings of mulled\nwine.\nFor film fans, this may mean another\nyear of being made to sit in front of\nJimmy Stewart classic It\u2019s a Wonderful\nLife so that the family can share in the\njoy of life. Let\u2019s not forget this a story\nabout a man who wants to kill himself\nhowever, and so for those who don\u2019t\nfancy a side of suicide with their tur-key, I\u2019d personally recommend festive\ndoses of German terrorism, house sitting and house swapping.\nFirstly, I am of course referring to the\nwonderful charm of Die Hard. This\nis the same sort of medication as the\nChristmas Day double bill of EastEnders when you realise that your family\nsquabbles aren\u2019t such an issue compared to having either the Mitchells\nor a gun-toting Alan Rickman around\nto share the stuffing. Hence, why not\ntune in for a fix of Bruce that will keep\nall the family wide awake until boxing\nDay?\nAlternatively, there\u2019s the option of\nstepping back in time to an era in\nwhich Michael Jackson was still known\nfor touching children\u2019s hearts and not\ntheir privates, and his mate Macauley\nCaulkin wasn\u2019t some washed up has-been with more than adverts for Orange sparsely populating his CV. It is\nof course Home Alone time and whilst\nChristmas may be complete without it,\nit certainly needn\u2019t be. Kids film? Perhaps. But it certainly is a lot more appealing than most of the CGI guff that\nkids lap up now. Not in my day I tell\nyou...\nAs a third option I\u2019ve decided to be\nsomewhat more controversial and suggest last years The Holiday. Admitting\nthis feels like some sort of public self-flagellation, but a healthy one. After all,\ndespite its failings at originality, it was\nhandled with a sweetness that is hard\nto scoff at. At least at Christmas. With\nKate Winslett leading the cast, and\nJude Law close behind, it even manages\nto pull up the lowly Cameron Diaz and\nJack Black who all come off as incredibly likeable. Strangely so, and so much\nso that by the end I was even supporting Diaz rather than wanting her to slip\non the ice and smash her never-been-the-same-since-The Mask face in.\nOkay, I probably haven\u2019t convinced\nyou fully, but at least there\u2019s a bit of\ninspiration to reach for something\nother than poor Jimmy or Love Actually. Chances are the three above will\nimpress more than the DVD your gran\ngot you because she still thought you\nliked the Disney ones.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nunder this heavy weight that The Golden Compass finds itself. The outset is\ngood, and a quick tour of this magical\nworld courtesy of Eva Green in the first\ncouple of minutes, sets the stage well\nbefore you expect to get into the meat\nof the story. Sadly there\u2019s more meat to\nbe found on Nicole Kidman than in the\nstory here and so we\u2019re left with pretty\nslim pickings for fans of plot.\nPerhaps this sounds overly critical.\nThe film, after all, is perfectly watch-able but the time and emotion I was\nexpected to invest in a drunken polar\nbear was poorly judged, even if it did\nspeak in Ian McKellen\u2019s thespian tones.\nThere is a child-kidnapping story that\ngoes from something just dropped\ninto conversation near the beginning of the film to the wobbly pivot\non which the story turns, and I found\nmyself in strangely foreign cinema territory when I realised I was impatiently\nawaiting the return of the normally irritating Nicole Kidman.\nIt is great to watch Kidman sinking\nher teeth into the role of the wicked\nMrs Coulter and her scenes soar above\nthe others in terms of enjoyability. The\nother star names seem pretty minimally used here but I assume that will be\nrectified in later episodes. Eva Green,\nespecially, seems pretty unsure how to\nplay her role, going for a horribly overdone smouldering that equipped her\nwell in Casino Royale but seems slightly unnecessary here when she walks up\nto the ten-year old heroine and makes\nher guess who her former lover is.\nSaid ten year old, Lyra, is handled\nwith more suitable conviction by newcomer Dakota Blue Richards which is\njust as well considering awkward children in lead roles have a tendency to\nmake me queasy. Her haughty attitude\ndoes seem to rise and wane every second but I can imagine she will generally come out of the trilogy better than\nsome other members of the cast.\nWhen all is said and done however,\nthis is still a film that people will flock\nto. The issues hinted at provide a talking point amongst adults I suppose, but\neven with such highly regarded books\nfor guidance, Compass ends up lost.\nThe Golden Compass \u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Chris Weitz\nWriter: Chris Weitz\nPhillip Pullman\nCast: Nicole Kidman,\nDaniel Craig,\nEva Green\nAlex Casey\nA Comedy of Power \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Claude Chabrol\nWriter: Odile Barsky\nCast: Isabelle Huppert\nFran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and\napartment automatically reveal the\ntrue relationship between husband and\nwife, strongly reinforcing the feelings\nof solitude and distance conveyed by\nIsabelle Huppert and Robin Renucci.\nSimultaneously, the repetitive scenery\nof office, apartment and office again,\ncorrelates nicely with the vicious circle\nof interrogation and custody, which\nseems to lead nowhere.\nUltimately, Claude Chabrol clearly\ngives up on filming an engrossing political action thriller in favour of an arresting psychological drama and, with\nthe cast at hand, it turns out to be a\ngreat call. Isabelle Huppert is too intriguing throughout the whole film to\never leave you wishing for more action.\nA nice note of realism, rarely found in\nHollywood movies, is that all the characters are flawed and they stay imperfect until the very end, an end which,\nby resolving nothing, is the perfect\nconclusion.\nA happy Huppert\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\nComment\nDawkins\u2019 approach to Christmas\nBoyang Xia\nI\nn a few weeks time the most sacred holiday of Western capitalism will take place: Christmas.\nFor Christians and Muslims\nto whom this pagan festival is\nunknown: Christmas celebrates the\nbirth of Baby Jesus (distinctly different from the crucified God Jesus in\nhair, eye and skin colour, race, gender\nand texture). Its origin is shrouded in\nclouds of mystery and tax-free donated televangelism.\nDawkins, using the same arguments\nas in his book The God Delusion,\npoints out that Christmas is not religious as no holy books prescribe the\ncelebration of this special day, in the\nsame way as our morality is not derived\nfrom religions as our modern day ethical standards differs vastly from those\nin the Biblical/Koranic times.\nIn chapter 7, Dawkins points out, that\n\u201cwe do not \u2013 even the religious among\nus \u2013 ground our morality Christmas in\nholy books.\u201d (What appears to be far-fetchedly confusing, makes a hell of a\nlot more sense after being brainwashed\nby the anteceding chapters).\nWell, how can we then understand\nthe origins of Christmas without the\nreligious context which we are brought\nup by our evil indoctrinating parents\nto believe in?\nI suppose we might be able to find\nthe answer after careful studies of\nholidays in general. Holidays seem to\nbe globally widespread and a common\ntrait of human societies. Their main\nfunction is to make people rest and\ndo nothing, an inactivity which social\nmammals spend a great share of their\ntime on.\nThey prefer to do so in groups which\nenhances the unproductivity of this\nuseless idleness far more than a single\nindividual is able to. For this purpose\nthey waste huge amounts of resources\non building and decorating decadent\narchitecture, like churches, in which\nthey celebrate holidays. Churches, by\nthe way, are not religious institutions,\nas Dawkins powerfully demonstrated,\nbecause their modern form and function differs too much from the Biblical\ncontext.\nSo, what is the final conclusion from\nour reasoning? Christmas \u2013 the climax\nin a perpetual boring ritual of doing\nnothing? Well, that\u2019s its primary Nature-intended function. Therefore, if\nyou are experiencing shopping stress\nnow and preparing yourself mentally\nfor the pain of meeting people and actually being nice to them because some\ntheologians and parents told you to do\nso, think about Christmas\u2019 genuine\nmeaning.\nTake some time, sit down in a silent\nplace, make yourself comfortable, daydream and if you are pretentious, contemplate the meaninglessness of your\nlife.\nSometime you\u2019ll die, heading into\nthe darkest nothingness beyond the\nborders of the universe and leaving the\nworld as a decomposing body; unless\nyou donate it to science, in which case\nyou end up as pickled slices in collections or as toys in the hands of medics\n(visualise that at dinner). But before\nthat happens, you live. And have a\nhappy life.\nMerry Christmas.\nThe columnist is the last of the\nMohists (pun intended). He\nbelieves in a personal God, in\nuniversal love and peace.\nProf. Richard Dawkins never\ngave his approval to the opinions\nexpressed in this article, although\nhe admitted privately (without\nauthenticity) the logical fallacies\nI point out here. He also said he\nwill deny this fiercely in public\n(again, without authenticity).\nConsistency in the use of a typewriter\nT\noday, I am writing to you\nfrom a typewriter. An off-off-grey, heavy, noisy, A3sized electrical typewriter\nwith badly-labelled keys\nand an electrical safety sticker that is\nworryingly out of date. I found this\nplastic monstrosity out on the street\nthe other day, and, sucker that I am\nfor anything second-hand (practical-ity and condition are not factors that\ninfluence me in the slightest), brought\nit home. I was able to get it to work\nwithout too much effort, and, highly\npleased with myself, promptly stuck it\nunder my bed. Not wanting to admit\nto myself that the whole experience\nwas a total waste of effort, I brought it\nout and decided to write something on\nit. And this seemed as good a thing as\nany.\nIt is a weird sensation, typing on a\ntypewriter \u2013 one I\u2019ve had often before,\nand, which I have to admit, I like enor-mously. It is hard though. Very hard.\nNot because of any purely mechanical\ndifficulties, but rather due to considerable mental ones. We are all so used to\nthe immense reformatting powers of\nMicrosoft Word that it is almost impossible to write more than two consecutive coherent sentences without\nmakingsometerriblemistake.Anysen-tence on a word processor is, for me, a\nterrifying linguistic adventure \u2013 I have\nno idea where the nearest verb will be,\nwhether or not I will be able to work\nthat polysyllabic adjective in before the\ncomma, or if the sentence will run out\nof steam before I can get to the end.\nMore importantly, of course, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. Should I make a mistake, it can\nbe corrected in less time than it took\nto write the thing in the first place. Not\nthe case with a typewriter.\nCoherence of thought is essential if\nyou want to produce a neat-looking\ndocument at the end (and let\u2019s face it,\na roll of paper sticking out of a type-writer, much as is happening to me\nnow, is cool. Or not, of course; as you\nwish), and that is a skill that I seem to\nhave lost. I now speak like I type on\nthe computer. I launch myself into sentences having no earthly idea how they\nwill finish, being used to the safety net\na computer always affords.\nIt has taken me more time to write\nthis than it would usually. As a matter\nof fact, it hasn\u2019t. I thought it would, as\nthe time needed between sentences\nto map out those coming up is far, far\nlonger. At the same time, though, the\ninability to go back spurs you onwards,\nmuch like Cortez\u2019s burning of his\nships forced his men deeper into unexplored territory. My thoughts have\nnow become more coherent. Granted,\nthey may well be less interesting; less\neloquent; less amusing; less relevant;\nbut they are more refreshing to write.\nI think everyone should be forced to\nwrite on a typewriter once in a while; if\nonly to prove to them their dependence\non the backspace key and a mouse, but\nmore fundamentally, to give to their\nthought processes and their speech a\nconsistency which is gradually being\nlost.\nTeddy bears and extremists\nAmmar Waraich\nI\nam so tired of teddy bears,\ncartoons and a handful of extremists always having the ultimate say about the faith and\nidentity of a third of the world\u2019s\npopulation.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get into another\none of Felix\u2019s annual \u2018debates\u2019 on Islam\nor religion, nor do I want to prance\naround making arguments about freedom of speech or naming teddy bears.\nAs we all know, a kind and friendly\nteacher who wanted only good things\nfor Sudan and its people listened to\nsome kids and named a teddy bear\nMuhammad\u2026 BIG DEAL!\nIt is pretty obvious that the Sudanese\nare in the wrong in this farce and if\nyou honestly think that they have the\nsupport of any more than 0.0001% of\nthe Muslim population then you must\ngenuinely think that we are insane (and\neven that support is probably from politically motivated, frustrated people\nwho blame the West for everything \u2013\ne.g. the small crowds who protested in\nSudan). Additionally, it is evident that\nthis whole incident seemed to Khartoum to be a once-in-a-blue-moon\ngolden opportunity to get its own back\nfor the criticism in Darfur, whilst also\ntrying to get the sympathy of other\nMuslim countries across the Middle\nEast against \u2018the West\u2019 by using their\nreligion as the rallying call. Sadly for\nSudan though, they failed miserably on\nboth accounts and hugely embarrassed\nthemselves!\nIt saddens me no end to actually have\nto state that as a Muslim, I was not in\nthe least bit offended by Mrs Gibbons.\nBut to be honest, if by now you have\nnot been able to see past the media\u2019s\ncherry-picked reporting then no matter what I say, it probably won\u2019t make\nany difference to you. However, I am\nfrustrated by not having a positive\nvoice for my beliefs on campus or in\nsociety. To this end, I have decided to\nactively make myself available to anyone who wants to talk to me to about\nwhy I believe that there is only one unseen God, why I believe that Muhammad was the final messenger of God,\nand hence why I believe that Islam is\nthe final divine revelation, the ultimate\ntruth. Therefore, if you genuinely want\nto learn about Islam, get in touch with\nme (aaw204@ic.ac.uk) and depending on your enthusiasm, I may invite\nyou to a free lunch where we can go\nthrough the noble Quran together, the\nfinal word of God. Otherwise, look out\nfor the Islamic Awareness stall I will be\nstarting next term where a few of us\nwill be available to take any questions\nyou may have; which will hopefully be\na weekly endeavour.\nA glorious typewriter moments before spewing out glorious literature\nGilead Amit\n\n"

It was OK\nI\nwas told to go in to this year\u2019s\nRevue with low expectations \u2013\nthe direction was going to be\nlacklustre, some singing cringe\nworthy and the dancing poor.\nHowever, the programme promised me\n\u201cOur most ambitious Revue yet\u201d. The\nfact that the auditorium was packed to\nthe rafters was obviously a good sign\nso I decided to let go of any bias and sit\ndown to enjoy the show.\nMTsoc\u2019s Revue is an annual event\nwhich compromises of a slight plot and\ntonnes of popular musical numbers.\nThis year\u2019s \u2018The Rise and Fall of David\nSullivan\u2019 was a satire on the supposed\nrivalry between the techies and per-formers. The plot starts out with this\ntheme in mind but quickly looses it in\nfavour of lesbians and transsexuals.\nAlthough Paul Dingwall\u2019s suspender\nwearing, chest-baring Scottish techie\ntranssexual was hilarious, I felt his\nnewly lesbian girlfriend, Sandra (Han-nah Bundock) got a bit too much stage\ntime. I thought she was brilliantly energetic but more time should have\nbeen spared for other more entertaining plotlines, like the one promised to\nus in the title of the show!\nLesbian Super-Slag, Maureen (Alicia\nBlunt) was fantastic as Sandra\u2019s preda-tor. Her rendition of The Wild Party\u2019s\n\u2018Old Fashioned [Lesbian] Love Story\u2019\nwas fantastic! Every \u2018bush\u2019 and \u2018bean\u2019\nreference was announced with such\nrelish we couldn\u2019t help but pee ourselves quietly in the back!\nHead-techie, Dave Sullivan (Matt\nWoods) and the \u2018Starlet of the Show\u2019,\nRhapsody (Emily May) really stole\nthe show for me. Their story was FAR\nmore interesting and funny than any of\nthe others. Emily May was suitably diva\nbut she showed a soft side to the classic\n\u2018Diva Bitch\u2019 we often see in theatre.\nMatt Wood\u2019s hair got us all talking\nafterwards. I was going to dedicate half\nthis review to his hairstyle - his glossy,\nwavy locks were always going to make\nit to the stage \u2013 but that wouldn\u2019t really\ngive him credit for his talents on stage.\nMatt and Emily\u2019s joint numbers were\nby far the best in the whole show \u2013 \u2018We\nBoth Reached For The Gun\u2019 (Chicago)\nand \u2018Anything You Can Do\u2019 (Annie Get\nYour Gun).\nThe chorus was brilliant though and\nI wish they had been utilised more.\nThere were some brilliant numbers,\nsuch as \u2018I Hope I Get It\u2019 (Chorus Line)\nand the finale; \u2018We\u2019re All In This Together\u2019 (High School Musical). These\nreally showed the hard work that had\ngone into the show. On the other hand,\n\u2018La Vie Boheme\u2019 (Rent) was messy,\nunpolished and hard to follow. For\nsome reason the choreographer had a\nlarge part in this [over] long number.\nI thought he could have stuck to his\nchoreography duties and definitely\nmoved aside for a different member of\nthe chorus.\nThe whole Revue was much longer\nthan last year\u2019s. I felt it dragged slightly\nat the end where yet more lesbian-relat-ed numbers were squeezed in but there\nwas a twist in the plot, which I enjoyed.\nThey couldn\u2019t possibly have killed off\nthe title character so they went back\nin time and everything turned out fine\n\u2013 finale was sung, cast applauded and\ndistinctly average comments made.\nIn summary, I thought the cast did\nbrilliantly. A few more cheesy grins\nmight have been in order but they\nweren\u2019t to blame at all for the poor\ndistribution of songs and plot. More\nIs this really what theatre is like?\nLucy Harrold likes the Southbank. Lucy Harrold likes caffine. Lucy Harrold doesn\u2019t like this exhibiton\nI\ndo like the Southbank - it\u2019s so\neclectic! You\u2019ve got the BFI Museum, the National Theatre and\nloads of bookstalls along the\nriver. Plus there\u2019s all this amazing modern architecture like the OXO\nTower and the London Eye, some fantastic older architecture like the Globe\nTheatre and then you\u2019ve got the Tate\nModern- a huge mass of power station\nblandness.\nHowever, the interior of the Tate\nModern is a bit of disappointment \u2013it\u2019s\njust more concrete, minimalism and\n\u201ccool\u201d signage that\u2019s rather difficult to\nfollow. The signs told me that the exhibition and tickets were on the fourth\nfloor and so off I trooped, taking the\nstairs as the lifts at the Tate Modern\nare tiny, infrequent and full of buggies.\nI reached the fourth floor to find that\nmy ticket was actually on the first floor\nin some random information room at\nthe back. The turbine hall also happened to be on the first floor, so I had a\nlittle peek at \u201cThe Crack\u201d. Yes it is just a\nbig crack - you can even see the chicken wire where they reinforced it.\nSo, again, back up to the fourth floor,\nwhere I finally got to the exhibition.\nGiving my ticket to the woman, she\nsays \u201cHow many more will they find?\u201d,\nI just thought \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d at this\nrandom outburst until I found out this\nwas actually part of the exhibition. Apparently, Tino Sehgal\u2019s contribution to\nthe exhibition is getting random people to say random crap to other random people within the exhibition.\nRemember to take the booklet they\noffer you. It tells you what the artists\nhave actually done, and more impor-tantly, gives a map of the exhibition.\nAlthough the pieces are numbered on\nthe map, unfortunately there are no\nnumbers by the actual pieces.\nThe point of The World as a Stage\nis to show the relationship between\nvisual art and theatre. It took me quite\na while to figure out how some of the\npieces connected to this theme! In\nfact, very little of the exhibition had\nanything to do with the theatre or the\nstage! Especially guilty of this were the\ntwo \u201cperformance art\u201d videos. The\nfirst, \u201cThe Chittendens: The Resuscitation of Uplifting\u201d by Catherine Sullivan\nwas just a film of people in strange costumes making pointless gestures. Oh\nha-ha, very funny- that\u2019s what theatre\u2019s\nalways like!? The other, \u201cLuna\u201d, was by\nCezary Bodzianowski which consisted\nof a video of himself with a roller-skate\non one hand and one foot trying to get\nup within a rotating drum. Why?\nStrangely I liked Bodzianowski\u2019s other piece, \u201cFlying Helmet\u201d, in which he\nmeasured the dimensions of the Globe\nTheatre so he could compare them to\nthe dimensions of the Earth. This was\nsupposed to show the literal analysis\nof the relationship between the stage\nand the world that Shakespeare gives.\nIt was kind of fun and kooky to see this\nrather chubby guy walking around the\nGlobe Theatre with a measuring tape.\nOne piece I completely did not get\nwas \u201cThe Redwood and The Raven\u201d\nby Trisha Donnelly. For a start, it was\nhardly anything spectacular to look\nat; just a single small black and white\nphoto of a woman dancing in front of\na tree. The booklet informed me that\neach day this picture changes to build\nup a sequence of this old lady dancing\nto Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s poem The Raven.\nSorry Mr Tate, I\u2019m not paying the \u00a35.50\nstudent concession every day for a\nmonth just so I can see how the dancer\nmoves in 31 separate photographs.\nThere were a few pieces that I did enjoy alot. Roman Ond\u00e1k\u2019s , \u201cI\u2019m just acting in it\u201d, was clever. The premise was\nthat he described himself to a group of\nregular gallery-goers and got them to\ndraw their perception of him walking\naround the empty gallery. The results\nwere varied but all showed the artist a\nsingular, lonely person looking rather\nglum which seemed universally relat-able to.\nAlso receiving an honourable mention is Rita McBride\u2019s \u201cArena\u201d, just because it\u2019s so bloody huge! \u201cArena\u201d is a\nhuge seating structure made of fibreglass sections slotted together like a big\njigsaw.\nAnd so to the one piece that made\nthe trip worthwhile, even though it had\nvery little do with the theme of linking\nvisual art and theatre. I don\u2019t think any\nof us students are quite old enough to\nremember the Miner\u2019s Strike of 1984-5.\nThere was a violent clash between police and the angry miners on strike in\nSouth Yorkshire, which is now notorious as the \u2018Battle of Orgreave\u2019. In \u201cThe\nBattle of Orgreave Archive (an Injury\nto One is an Injury to All)\u201d, Jeremy\nDeller (one of the few British artists in\nthe exhibition) has documented his attempts to re-enact the battle, similar in\nstyle to those civil war re-enactments\nthat always seem to be at county fairs,\nmainly consisting of fat, bearded men\nwith muskets. Deller\u2019s piece comes in\ntwo parts. The first is a room of memorabilia and artefacts from the time and\nfrom general re-enactments, a timeline of the strike surrounds the wall\nto give the reader all the information\nthey need for the second part- the film\nof the re-enactment itself. I could have\nstayed for the whole 62 minutes of film\nif it hadn\u2019t been for all the people that\nwere there before me leaving- and then\nall the people that were there after me\ngoing too.\nThe documentary was enthralling;\ninterspersing clips on the preparations\nfor the battle were views on the history\nfrom both former miners and police-men. Many of the people involved in\nthe strike itself had returned to re-live\nit for art!\nAfter all this arty-farty stuff and sensing cold and wet weather outside in the\nreal world, I headed towards the Tate\nCaf\u00e9 to take in some sort of caffeinated\nsubstance. Here\u2019s a tip: don\u2019t bother.\nJust nip down the road to Starbucks\ninstead. The caf\u00e9 itself had a massive\nqueue outside and appeared to be\ngeared more towards \u201ccontemporary\u201d\nfamilies having a late lunch than coffee deprived students. In conclusion,\ndon\u2019t bother with this exhibition unless you\u2019re really into performance art\nor modern art in general and happen\nto be on the Southbank with nothing\nto do. And if you still insist on going,\ntake a thermos!\nO Come All Ye Art Lovers,\nIt closes on New Years\u2019 Day\nSo Hark your Herald skates on!\nAs demonstrated by this Health and Safety Official at the Tate Modern, some viewers may find some\nimages at this exhibition shocking and disturbing. Be warned, enthusiastic art lover\n\u00a9 THE ARTIST\nCOURTESY GALERIE CATHERINE BASTIDE, BRUSSELS AND METRO PICTURES, NEW YORK\ntechie-performer rivalry and less muff\nwould have made this Revue perfect!\nThe Rise and Fall of David Sullivan ran from the 2nd to 3rd\nDecember. Missed out? Tough\npoopy. Only joking! You can catch\nmore MTsoc revelry in the Easter\nTerm with their Spring show,\nHow to Succeed in Business\nWithout Really Trying. Maybe all\nyou wannabe bankers should go\nalong to that.\nWe\u2019re flying without wings!\n21\n\n"

This\nis ludicrous; the government of Sudan\nrepresents its people neither culturally\nnor religiously. It has succeeded since\ntaking power via a coup in 1989 to mix\nreligion and politics to form a concoction that serves its political views\nwhilst hiding behind the impenetrable\nshield of people\u2019s fear of religion. Politically since the world \u201cdiscovered\u201d\nthe atrocities in Darfur (which by pure\nchance coincided with the destabili-sation of one of the main areas of pe-troleum), the British government and\nthe international community has been\nleaning on Sudan to review its human\nrights infringements. The government,\nhaving an Arab mentality, has used\nMrs Gibbons as a political tool to send\na message to the British government\nthat they are not to be trifled with.\nTo understand Sudan, one needs to\nlook at its history, it only achieved independence from the British Empire in\n1956 and has since experienced a total\nof only nine years of democracy. The\nrest of the time Sudan has only known\ndictatorships, from Communist to\nFundamental Islamic Sharia\u2019 and anything in between. Islam entered Sudan\nvia trade as opposed to wars, and so\nSufism is the prevailing practice among\nthe country\u2019s Muslim population.

The thing is, Ridgeway Park\nis so absolutely unbelievably strange.\nFirstly you need to gain access to the\npark, this in itself is quite a mission.\nThe park\u2019s opening time is subject to\nTravels without my aunt part 5: Ridgeway Park\nAmin Elmubarak\nthe whims of the park-keeper who himself is wildly influenced by such factors\nas the luminescence of the moon, the\nstate of the England football team and\nwhether his piles are playing up. If the\npark gates are open, you are not necessarily in luck. Next you must negotiate\nhordes of teenagers who chillax in the\nvicinity of most entrances. This can\nbe achieved however though use of a\n\u201cTrojan Horse\u201d or the local Mr Whippy\nvan as others refer to it. Simply bribe\nthe nice ice cream flavoured man with\ncherry flavoured ASBOs and you are\nin; it is best to keep a low profile for a\nwhile when inside as the squirrels can\nbe particularly savage when provoked\nby human contact or the gurgle of a\nsmall baby.\nIn the park you will find that there\nare a plethora of activities that await\nyour eager quivering bodies. Firstly,\nlet\u2019s play Tennis. You will need a tennis\nracket, balls and industrial amounts of\nconcrete with which to relay the court.\nIndeed, such is the state of the courts\nin Ridgeway Park that it is proposed\nthat they could also double as a multipurpose dirt-bike course between sets.\nIn retrospect allowing the \u201cChingford\nand Generic Area 7b Annual Ploughing Championships\u201d to take place on\nthe tennis courts has now been deemed\nless than successful.\nOnce you are all shagged out from\nthose topspin lobs, it\u2019s time to relax.\nLuckily Ridgeway Park boasts a quirky\nand unique feature \u2013 a model railway\nthat you can ride on! Never before has\nso much fun been had as you wait expectantly at the track wondering when\nthe little steam engine will arrive (it\nwill arrive shortly, the track is a mere\n5 metres long).\nTom Culley Once on, balance is key to your survival as our family learnt the hard way\nwhen my dad, thrill-seeking as ever,\nleant slightly too hard to the left as we\nrounded a corner causing whole carriages to derail off the track and innumerable little children to be flung onto\ngrassy verges around us; the charges\nwere later dropped.\nAs the sun hazily retreats behind\nthe local waste disposal complex, it\u2019s\ntime to head home son, gather up your\nbaseball gloves and let\u2019s leave the park\nfor home-made sausage, egg and chips.\nUnfortunately the park is now closed\nas the park-keeper has noticed that\nthere is an unexpected repeat of \u201cDick\nand Dom in da Bungalo\u201d on UKTV bi-tesize and so has locked up early. You\nforage in the bushes for dinner and unexpectedly find a Dairy Lee Duncable.\nResult.

It\u2019s unique in that its people are\na mix of Arabs from the Middle East\nand Africans that was instigated many\ncenturies ago, so much so that they resemble neither Arabs nor Africans.\nBut to really understand this, the\ngeographically largest country in Africa, is to immerse yourself amongst its\npeople with this quote from a prominent Sufi man during the instigation\nof the Sharia\u2019 Law in September 1984:\n\u201cSudan is a country of giants ruled by\ndwarves\u201d. The people of Sudan may be\npoor and simple, but the majority are\nsurprisingly well-educated and well-read, incredibly accommodating, and\nkind. Geographically it\u2019s very rich: it\nhas the deep blue Nile and the shallow,\ncrocodile-rich white Nile that meet in\nthe centre of the capital city Khartoum.\nIn the east coast, in a city called Port\nSudan, there is the largest concentration of hammerhead sharks in the red\nsea \u2013 perfect for scuba diving. In the\nwest there is Jabal Mara, a most peculiar mountain that has almost every\ndifferent type of climate as you ascend\nit.\nThe food and drink is an assault on\nthe senses, the markets are vibrant and\nthe people are friendly and although\nit\u2019s a Muslim country they have a peculiar beer made from dates that, I have\non good authority, is pretty amazing\n(just don\u2019t get caught!)\nShamefully the government has\nspent most of its money on itself and\non its civil war against the south of\nSudan from 1984-2005 to work on its\ntourism, but it\u2019s all there for the discovery if one chooses to go for it.\nUpon returning, much to the surprise of many, including myself, Mrs\nGibbons stated: \u201cThe Sudanese people\nI found to be extremely kind and generous and until this happened I only had\na good experience \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t like to\nput anyone off going to Sudan.\u201d Personally I was relieved that she was able to\ndifferentiate between the government\nand the people of Sudan. So go on, get\nyour shots, change your money (the\nexchange rate is awesome!), buy your\nvisa and go visit this poor country of\ngentle giants that is waiting to be dis-covered. Just don\u2019t talk to anyone with\na uniform for longer than you have to.\nThe Felix travel section gets a little bit political as Amin Elmubarak describes Sudan to us, which has\nrecently been under the media spotlight due to the allegedly inappropriate naming of a teddy bear.\nSudan\u2019s markets are bustling... usually\n37\nFriday 7 December 2007 felix\n\u201cThe food and\ndrink is an\nassault on the\nsenses.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "47\nfelix\nFriday 7 December 2007\nsport.felix@Imperial.ac.uk Sport\nThe importance of water\nGil Saville\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nWater is crucial for us to remain\nhealthy and alive, but all too often it\nis taken for granted as to why it is so\nimportant and to what extent it helps\nus perform better in exercise. Water is\nthe second most important element to\nlife, after oxygen. The body can survive\nfor weeks without food but only days\nwithout water, and often for a lot less\nin warm temperatures and high alti-tudes. The body and all its organs are\ncomprised mainly of water; making the\naverage person about 60-75% water.\nWater is essential to all bodily func-tions. It aids our digestive system with\nthe absorption of nutrients, it\u2019s involved in the regulation of body temperature and blood circulation, it helps\nin the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells and removes waste products from the body. Alongside these\nfunctions, water also helps to reduce\nwear on joints providing lubrication\nand cushioning, including the spinal\ncord. Without sufficient water supply\n(dehydration) we open up our bodies\nto all kinds of problems. Dehydration\ncan lead to hypertension, asthma, allergies and migraines.\nThe main function of water is its\nrole in regulating our temperature. We\ngenerate heat when we train and there\nare numerous mechanisms which the\nbody calls upon to lose heat. Obviously\nthe surrounding environment plays a\nrole, but sweating is a significant method of cooling. The evaporation of fluid\nfrom the skin is very effective. During\nprolonged exercise it is possible to lose\nas much as two litres of sweat per hour.\nThis would be ideal in keeping us cool,\nbut unfortunately not all sweat evapo-rates, as some drips off the skin and is\nwasted.\nFluid loss, even as little as 2% of body\nweight, can seriously impair the capacity to perform muscular work. In\ntemperate climates, most athletes lose\n1-5% of body weight in prolonged ex-ercise, even when taking regular fluid\nthroughout.\nWater transports oxygen, nutrients,\nhormones and antibodies through the\nblood stream and lymphatic system\n(used to fight cancer, viruses, bacteria and infections). This is obviously\nimportant to us as we push our bodies hard in the gym and by doing so we\ngreatly increase the amount of water\nthat our body excretes. When we are\ndehydrated, our immune system is\ntherefore open to invasion from outside entities and we are more susceptible to the attack. Good hydration helps\nto protect us from this.\nBrain tissue is 85% water, and it uses\na twentieth of the body\u2019s blood supply.\nWhen you are dehydrated you have\nless water in the blood. This can reduce\nbrain functions, and cause fatigue, depression or stress. It can also lead to\nmigraines, which may be indicators of\npoor body temperature regulation.\nMuscle is 75% water, so it is important that a high water level is maintained in order to prevent muscular\ndehydration. When muscles become\ndehydrated they are open to possible\nloss of strength and cramps. Cramps\nare muscular spasms where a muscle\ncontracts abnormally and locks into an\nawkward position. Although the direct\ncause of cramps remains unknown, it\nis known that muscles that are over-worked, injured or exposed to extreme\ntemperatures are more likely to succumb to cramp. Water helps to regulate our body temperature and aids in\nthe transport of nutrients to cells, so by\nincreasing water intake we can reduce\nthe risk of cramps.\nWater is also a lubricant for the\njoints and the cartilage between the\nvertebrae and at the end of long bones\nat synovial joints there is also a significant amount of water. Cartilage needs\nto be well-hydrated as this prevents\nabrasive damage occurring when the\nopposing surfaces of the cartilage make\ncontact with each other. Long term inadequately hydrated joints can lead to\nfriction damage resulting in joint deterioration and pain.\nAnother reason why water is important is due to the fact that when we\ndehydrate, our body\u2019s solution loses\nviscosity,whichinturnreducestheeffi-ciency of the protein and enzyme functions of the body. So when we are trying to increase our protein absorption,\nwater is vital, as acids and enzymes in\nthe stomach will break food down into\na more fluid state as part of the digestion process. Lack of fluid means you\nwill not be able to break down the food\nas easily and efficiently.\nWater is also fundamental with regards to strength. Being slightly dehydrated will reduce a muscle\u2019s lifting\ncapability, and training when in this\nstate will reduce the strength gains that\nyou might normally get. If you can\u2019t lift\nas much as when you are adequately\nhydrated, then how can you expect to\npush harder and make gains?\nWater can also be one of the most\nuseful tools for losing weight. Water is\ncalorie-free so when you are on a restricted diet, drinking water can help\nfill you up and alleviate some of the\nhunger.\nSince I was away last week, and I forgot\nto mention to anyone in the office to\ndo the league table, we\u2019re a week be-hind. Sorry guys. And since I\u2019ve struggled to get all the results, we\u2019re gonna\nbe another week behind. Do not fear,\nhowever, as it is the last issue of term\nand so I\u2019ll have the whole winter holidays to get the table up to date.\nLike I mentioned in my editorial,\nfrom next term I will include all the\nmedical clubs out there so that we can\nget a clear picture as to which team is\ndoing the best across the college. For\nthis to work, it does mean that you guys\nare going to have to get those results in\non time to the Sports Partnership people (a.ayling@imperial.ac.uk).\nThis week, I thought I\u2019d show how\nthe clubs have been doing as a whole.\nAs we can see the Imperial Rugby Club\nare top of the table with 67 points. At\nthis point I want to point out that the\nscoring system is the same as it was\nbefore i.e. the ranking of the teams is\nbased on the Felix Index (FI), which\nis calculated as follows: FI = (W*5) +\n(D*2) \u2013 (L*4).\nRooted bottom of the table are the\nMedicasl Rugby, who have had a rather dissapointing start, altough it does\nseem as though their \u2018Great Escape\u201d\nhas begun.\nMeanwhile, the top of the table is\ndominated by Imperial sports clubs,\nwith the first medical entry being the\nnetball club at 11th place.\nThis league table will appear again\nat the end of next term, so things can\nchange.\nACROSS\n1 It\u2019s clear that the party\u2019s promises\ndon\u2019t have nothing in them (8)\n5 Add the almighty to the selection in\nthe bam (6)\n8 Unskilled member of the public\ngets a century, violently thrashing\naround in his sleep (10)\n9 Real cut up, going to cry (4)\n10 Initial stardom gives way to belief\nin past values (14)\n11 Penalties without an angry letter\n(7)\n13 Lisped Christmas doesn\u2019t start on\nthe strip of land (7)\n15 Clergyman starts to explain with\nsome panache (7)\n18 Is the tea for the Queen or us on\nthe inverse strait (7)\n21 Is the calf red?

    "content": "O\nn Monday, I attended\nthe Imperial College\nAhlul Bayt (Islamic) Society\u2019s conference about\nEvolution, an event\nwhich aimed at exposing the theory as\na lie, as a statistical impossibility and\nas a diversion from the real cause of all\nthings \u2013 god.\nThe speaker was introduced with\nthe claim that the society wanted to\npromote an exchange of ideas; he\ncan\u2019t have been listening, because he\nthen proceeded with what can only be\ndescribed as single-minded, bigoted\npropaganda. It was rather difficult\nto follow the lecture, as I was either\nchuckling at the extreme illogicality of\nsome of the facts that had been said, or\ncringing before such display of igno-rance. Sometimes a chorus of dissent\nfrom the crowd would cover the speaker\u2019s voice, and sometimes the brutal irrationality of those words was simply\ntoo much to bear. But nonetheless, I\nwas able to get the gist of the lecture as\na whole, simply because I have heard it\nrepeated over again by the same kind\nof people, under different religions.\nIt started with a claim that Darwinism and the theory of evolution have\nbeen behind such great evils as anar-chism, racism, communism, atheism,\nfascism and nazism. The \u201claw of the\njungle\u201d had apparently killed somewhere in the region of 180 million. It\nfollowed with well-known creationist\ntricks, such as irreducible complexity and argument by ignorance, and a\npoint by point refutation of the theory\nas a whole, by \u201cproving\u201d that mutations\nare only harmful, that intermediate\nspecies don\u2019t exist, and that science is\nalways correcting itself and therefore\nwrong. Everything was served with a\nlarge dose of Qur\u2019an, added here and\nthere to give a credible option, and\nan equally large portion of quotations\nfrom works of prominent evolutionar-ies and atheists, who all seem to doubt\nthe theory greatly, but still support it\n8 felix Friday 7 December 2007\nAbout 180m dead: Darwin accused\nPietro Aronica gives his opinion on Monday night\u2019s lecture that dared to dispute Darwin\u2019s salient theory\nout of what appears to be a psychological illness.\nI\u2019ve rarely heard such an immense\nnumber of absurd claims, spurious\nlinks between facts, such an obstinate\nrefusal to open one\u2019s eyes to reality\nand such blatant disregard for some\nevidence while overestimating other\nproofs on a totally arbitrary basis. After\nfive minutes, I had already lost count of\nthe questionable facts that I would have\nasked him to prove, the inconsistencies that I wanted to point out and the\nevident idiocies that were just begging\nto be exposed. Apart from the social-evils-of-evolution bit, everything else\nwas just a repeat on the same formula:\nsay a really big number, claim it\u2019s im-possible, and disprove the theory. The\nquantity of data given was overwhelm-ing, but it had to be: it was just meaningless calculations, oversimplified to\nthe point they had no connection to\nreality and made in a biased manner.\nMost of the logical connections were\na result of blind loyalty to the cause of\ncreation, as they completely ignored\nfacts and jumped to an immediate conclusion without even thinking about it;\nsome of them were simply wrong from\na biological, not even rational, point of\nview, and could be easily identified by\na youngster with nothing more than an\nA-Level in biology (such as myself) let\nalone by experts in the field.\nThe Q&A session vented the slithering unrest that had been going on\nduring the lecture in the form of giggles and sighs, and the speaker found\nhimself covered by questions that exposed the logical fallacies and inexact\nclaims in his arguments; rather than\ntrying to have a rational confrontation,\nhe merely repeated the same old facts\nall over again, with minor changes.\nHard pressed, he blatantly avoided the\ncentral area (where the newly-founded\nAASoc had positioned themselves and\nwere springing with new questions\nevery minute) to favour the sides and\nback, filled with middle-eastern looking people, all faith-abiding Muslims in\nhis eyes. The plan backfired when even\ngirls in hijab confronted him on the\nridiculousness of his theories. As the\nevent ended, many questions were still\nunanswered, and a general feeling was\npresent that the speaker was just trying\nto weasel out of the debate.\nOne thing I did not appreciate,\namong the others, was the absolute\nlack of balance in the lecture: it was a\none-way talk, with no opposition and\nno proof that undermined his theory.\nEverything that could have been used\nagainst him was carefully avoided, and\nhe never raised a single shadow upon\nhis questionable arguments. Also, everything was presented in a way a fortune teller would try to sell a potion:\nwith lots of big Latin- and scientific-sounding words to add non-existent\ncredibility, a thing he then claimed his\nopponents were doing as well.\nThe argument for Darwinism being\nthe root of all evil was just bad, with\nno other word required. Maybe you are\nfamiliar with the reductio ad Hitlerum,\nan impressive sounding Latin phrase of\nthe kind I mentioned before: basically,\nif Hitler liked X, X must be evil; other\ncommon variants are Nazis or Stalin\ninstead of Hitler. Anybody can spot the\nfallacy in it, by putting as X something\nthat is not considered unethical and\nstill was supported by Hitler, like dogs,\nor paintings. But the lecturer went fur-ther, as he claimed that Darwinism was\nthe cause of nazism, fascism, atheism,\ncommunism, racism and anarchism.\nIt\u2019s a simple thing to forget, I guess,\nthat anti-Semitism existed for millennia before Darwin was even born, that\nHitler liked playing the blame game in\na depression-ravaged hunger-stricken\nGermany, that Socrates had already\nquestioned the existence of the gods,\nand that racism is old as humanity\nitself. And how can he say that com\u201cIt followed\nwith well-known\ncreationist\ntricks such\nas irreducible\ncomplexity.\u201d\n\u201cUsing Latinsounding\nwords to add\nnon-existent\ncredibility.\u201d\nThe man himself, Charles Darwin, was at the centre of some passionate debate. Posthumously, of course.\nThis is Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution as envisioned by Dr Babuna. We decided to name the pig \u2018Napolean\u2019 by the way\n\n"
