    "content": "ICLUBS & SOCIETIES\nCommunity\nAction Group\nThis club is not as dull as you may think. In\nfact, what we set out to do is have fun while\nhelping others. We have many projects that\nyou can help with if you're interested:\nThe Soup Run\nThis involves setting out at 11:00pm on Tuesdays and Fridays to take soup to the\nhomeless of London. It's certainly a good way\nto meet other students in the cramped conditions of the minibus and to see London\nlate at night! If you're interested, don't miss\nFresher s' Soup Run, tonight. Meet in Falmouth Kitchens at 10:30pm. The minibus\nwill drop off at the student Halls and Houses at\nabout 1:00pm. You will be surprised at the\nrange of people who sleep on the streets.\nActon Youth Club\nThis takes place on Saturday afternoons for\nmentally handicapped and able children.\nBasically all you do is play with the children on\nthe adventure playground, tiring but fun.\nOld People\nWe have two activities involving old people,\nvisiting them either at an old peoples home off\nHighS tree Kensington any day or on Wednesday afternoons in one of the wards at\nSt Pancras Hospital. Sometimes trips are\norganised for them and helpers are needed.\nNormally you just chat to them or play cards.\nBattered Wives Home\nWe help to take the children of these battered\nwomen on trips round London usually at\nweekends. The children especially enjoy it\nwhen male students help as they no longer\nhave a father figure around.\nDraught Proofing\nWorking in conjunction with Age Concern we\nsend helpers to draught proof windows of old\npeoples houses on Wednesday afternoons.\nMost of these projects don't mean a weekly\ncommitment. We cater for people who just\nwant to help when they have the time. Please\ncome and see us at Freshers' Fair and we'll\ngive you more details about the projects you're\ninterested in. If you have any more ideas we\ncan help you organise it. See you soon!\nHunger Project\nDid you know that...\n...more people have died as a consequence of\nhunger in the past five years than have been\nkilled in all the wars, revolutions and murders\nin the past 150 years.\n...28 human beings, 21 of them children, die as\na result of hunger every minute of every hour\nof every day; which amounts to fifteen million\npeople every year.\n...this devastation is equivalent to a Hiroshima\nevery three days.\n...and also that if only one seventh of the\nworld's yearly expenditure on alcohol and\ntobacco or just 1% of the world's yearly\nexpenditure on arms, were to allocated to\nsupporting food self-sufficiency, we could end\nworld hunger by the end of the century.\nIn 1977, the National Academy of Sciences\nin the USA published the results of a two-year\nstudy on world hunger conducted with the\nassistance of more than 1,500 experts from\naround the world. Their report concludes that\n\"If there is the political will in this country and\nabroad...it should be possible to overcome the\nworst aspects of widespread hunger and malnutrition within one generation.\"\nAnd will is only found in people. World\nhunger will persist so long as people leave the\nresponsibility with 'others' or 'governments'\netc. The Hunger Project has set about to\ngenerate the will to end world hunger by the\nend of this century. Two million people have\nenrolled in the hunger project since it started\nin 1977. An important point to realise is that\nevery single person makes a difference. YOU make a difference. The Hunger Project is\nabout creating the worldwide commitment\nnecessary to end world hunger, and this can\nonly be created th rou qh individuals: YOU.* If you would like to find out more about the\nHunger Project, or find out what you can do\nplease contact Clive Harries, Me ch Eng PG, int 3553 or Oliver Kleyn, Chem Eng PG, int\n3818. See us at the Freshers' Fair in the\nSherfield Lower Refectory.\nDebating\nThe Debating Society offers the opportunity\nfor students to discuss in a friendly but formal\natmosphere those issues, be they historical or\ntopical, theoretical or practical which interest\nthem most.\nSo if you are interested in debating you can\njoin the society either at the Freshers' Fair\nwhere our stall will be in the S her field Refectory, at our first meeting on October 11\nor by contacting C Day ME2 or J Smith\nPhysics 2.\nMopsoc\nThe first Mopsoc event of term is the cheese\nand wine party, which is held on the first\nThursday of term, and provides a rare opportunity to meet other students and academic staff in an informal atmosphere.\nEntrance is by membership and I look forward\nto seeing you there.\nSTOIC\nWho needs Channel 4 when Imperial College\nhas its own television station aimed specifically\nat students: STOIC. Not only can you watch\nour programmes, you can also help make and\nappear in them\u2014try doing that on Channel 4!\nIn fact, watching STOIC is childishly simple\nchildren often do. If you tune in on Tuesdays\nand Thursdays at 1:00 or 6:00pm by pressing\nthe STOIC button on a campus Hall TV set (in\nBe it, Garden, Weeks, L instead, Keo gh Falmouth, or Selkirk-Tizard) or just sitting in\nthe J CR or Southside TV Lounge, then by the\nwonder of modern technology (and Woolies)\nSTOIC will burst forth.\nIf you are interested in becoming a member of STOIC and learning about both the technical and nontechnical aspects of\ntelevision production, here's a diary of events\nto be held in the first weeks of term.

So for the benefit\nof those of you who weren't around to read the two summer\neditions of FELIX, here's what\nyou missed.\nDeputy President\nPhil Greenstreet, who was\nelected Union Deputy President\nlast term was unable to take up\nthe post because he failed his\nthird year Physics exams.\nThe Union will therefore be\nwithout a Deputy Pi^sident until\nanother election is held.

Mr Arthur Spirling, Operations and Service\nManager, responded by 'scram-bling' all passwords and correcting the faulty program by adding\none line. Previously users with\nmalicious intent have uncovered\nsome passwords especially those\nleft lying around on scraps of\npaper. MrS pir ling highly\nrecommends that users regularly\nchange their passwords.\nPrints Charming\nPeter Dawson joined the FELIX staff in July as the new printer,\nreplacing Ian Morse who left the\nUnion after eight years to\nbecome a full-time musician.\nConcrete Canoes\nAt the Concrete Canoe Championships held at Thorpe Park\non June 20, IC won two design\nawards for a30kg high-alumina\ncement canoe designed by third\nyear Civil Engineering student\nMike Rowley.\nAccommodation\nStudent Services have arranged\nto lease the Freemantle Hotel in\nCromwell Road to provide\naccommodation for students for\nthe next three years. A nine\nmonths' lease has also been\nagreed with owners of the\nSovereign Hotel, Cromweil\nRoad, to house postgraduates.\nThese measures mean that all\nIC fresher s wishing to live in\nCollege accommodation during\ntheir first year will be able to do\nso.\nSouthside Move Off?\nThe controversial and much\npublicised plan to move Union\nfacilities from Beit Quadrangle\nto Southside was shelved.\nInstead of moving all the\nUnion facilities, beginning July\n1983 and continuing over the\nfollowing year, College now\nproposes that the Union make\nuse of available space in Southside while retaining the Beit\nfacilities.\nA complete move in the next\nfew years cannot be ruled out,\nbut for the time being there is\nstill scope for discussion.\nBlackout\nThe Union Office was completely in the dark for several\ndays after an electrician working\nin the Lower Lounge drilled\nthrough a lighting cable.\nCar Rally\nThe FELIX Car Rally was\nclosely won by the '21296' team.\nAnswering the questions took\nthem to such places as the\nchurch of St Andrew-by-the Wardrobe, the Magic Circle\nheadquarters, and the surgery of\nDr Phang, a Hammersmith\ndentist, returning finally with the\ntreasure which included the\nreceipt for coffee at the Ritz and\nfour inflated balloons.\nDear Martin\nI am afraid that Captain Mint\nhas overlooked one important\nconsideration when he recommends that I be mandated to vet\nMary.

    "content": "Editorial\nA usual edition of FELIX will\ncontain a page reserved for news\nand information about sport at\nIC. How much news and how\nmuch information depends on club\nmembers sending such articles to\nFELIX. As well as match results\nand reports, news of tours and\ncompetition results any other\nnews concerning sport at IC.\nReports of club activities\nneed n't be just a resume of the\nresult, who scored, etc, but can be\nmade more entertaining (witness\nlast year's football reports). One\nthing which would be nice to see\non the sports page is photographs.\nPerhaps it is possible for a club\nmember to take photographs of\nclub activities and to drop them\ninto the FELIX Office. The sports\neditor will also try and get out and\nabout to take some photographs.\nAn important point concerning\nreports is when to hand them in. If\na report is to be published in\nFriday's FELIX then it must be\nhanded into the FELIX Office by\nthe previous Monday at 5:00pm. Finally, remember that the\nquality of the sports page is to a large extent determined by the\ncontributions received. Also let's hope that the sports page can\nreport sporting successes for clubs\nat IC as it has been able to do in\nprevious years.\nChris Mallaband\nSailing Club\nThe Sailing Club own six Firefly\ndinghy s, one of which we hope\nto replace this year. We sail\nevery Wednesday afternoon at\nthe Wels h Harp( Brent) Reservoir in Neasden, for practice and for fun but also enter a team in\nthe Southern Universities League\nwhich sail matches (team racing)\nagainst other universities, usually on Saturdays. It is also\npossible for individuals to sail on\nSundays in the Wembley Sailing\nClub races which are also held at\nThe Harp. So if you want to\n'mess about in boats' or sail\nmore seriously the Sailing Club is for you. The key word as with\nany other club is ' keenness'. Hope to see you at the Freshers' Fair, or failing that a group of people will be leaving\nfrom outside Southside at\n1:00pm on Wednesday October\n12. Details of how to get to The\nHarp and/ or who to contact\nabout sailing are on the Sailing\nClub noticeboard which is just\noutside the Southside Lower Refectory.\nISPORTI\nRowing for\nBritain\nFrom the Vienna World Rowing\nChampionship s,IC student\nThomas Anderson sent in this\nreport.\nDuring the summer vacation I was privileged to be chosen to\nrow for Great Britain in the\nMatch des Seniors, the unofficial\nUnder-23 Rowing Champion ship. This venture was supported\nby the Union and College who\nboth contributed to the costs as\nthe ARA cannot afford to run an\nunder-23 team.\nThe crew consisting of stroke\nThomas Anderson (IC), 3 Nick\nHartland( UC),2 Graham Wells\n( W LI HE), bow Francis Bucknall\n( KC), travelled to Vienna by\ntrain while the rest of the team\ndrove, Cambridge towing the\nboats.\nWe had to practise on the\ncourse in the morning and evening as it was over 100\u00b0F at\nmidday. Our race was to be at\n11:30 so we tried to get used to\nthe heat, which drained our energy really quickly. Luckily there was a slight cooling breeze.\nOn the day of the race there\nwas a strong head wind and it\nwas much cooler. The heat would have suited us but the\nwind ruined any chance we had\nof a medal as we were a very\nlight crew.\nIn the race West Germany and\nFrance jumped the start and got\nan instant eo us lead. We got\naway well and were lying third\npulling away from the Italians in\nfourth place and holding the\nFrench in second. The French\neventually got clear of us and we\nalmost had clear water on the\nItalians at the 1,000m mark( halfway). From this point on we\nwere just too light. The stronger\nand heavier Italian crew slowly\npulled back at us and eventually\ngot through and away to take\nthe bronze medal and leave us in\nfourth place. Our tactics of 'go\nout and hang on' had been right,\nbut the opposition just had too\nbig a weight advantage on the\nday.\nOther British results: Cam bridge 8 4th,AR A Double Scull\n6th,UL BC Coxless Pair 7th, Single Sculler 10th.

The thief made the\nexcuse that he was picking up\nsome papers and left. Suspicious,\nDr Inman called College Security. Geoffrey Reeves^ Chief\nOfficer and his deputy John\nBoroughs recognized the description and immediately set out\nfrom opposite ends of what they\nbelieved to be the thief s 'work-route'. They spotted him coming\nout of Mechanical Engineering\nand chased him down the road\nbehind Civil Engineering and\ninto an alleyway. Luckily the\ndoor leading out of the alley was\nlocked and the two officers were\nable to corner him.\nIn Magistrate Court the man\nadmitted the theft of Adrian\nClarke's wallet and five other\noffences on the police record. He\nwas sentenced to three months,\nwhich he is now sitting out.\nThe Security Officers have\nencouraged students to challenge anybody they do not\nrecognize and to alert them\nimmediately of any suspicious\nbehaviour. They expect the thief\nback when his time is up in\nJanuary and stress the need of\nstudent and faculty help in\nstopping these crimes.

Naturally, there will be\nteething troubles, and anyone\nwho has any constructive suggestions should write to him at\nthe Union Office.\nGoodbye\nTony\nDoctor Tony Haines, director of\nthe College Health Service,\nretired on September 1 to work\nin the Civil Service.\nHe resigned because he found\nthat he was spending too much\ntime on paperwork and not\nenough with students. Dr Ra\nGillon has been appointed his\nsuccessor, and Dr Haines patients have been transferred to\nDr Addenbrooke's list. This is a purely nominal process, and\nstudents can still ask to see any\ndoctor at the Health Centre.\nWALKABOUTLOOKSEE\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nWalkabout-Looksee was born in a pair of\ncomfortable shoes on an afternoon of\nexcruciatingly boring lab work and has\nflourished and prospered since; armed with an\n'A to Z',I set out to visit part of a museum's exhibit and come back to tell you about it.\nAt the William Weston Gallery near the\nPiccadilly end of Albemarle Street, is an\nexhibition of Kandinsky woodcuts of his\nKlange album, published in Munich in 1913\n(the title means notes in music.) During the\nperiod that Kandinsky worked on them he was\nundergoing his transformation from figurative\nto abstract artist. He started from the principle\nthat figures and objects were merely means to\nan end: the essential ingredient of a picture\nwas the spirit and emotion behind it. From this\nto the suppression of the object, and so to\ntotally abstract art, was a comparatively small\nstep. Of the prints on show, some definitely\nhave figures in them, some may have, and in\nsome the arrangement of black and white lines\nand patches of colour makes a purely\nemotional statement, like a phrase in music.\nAnd now for something completely\ndifferent\nOn the south side of Piccadilly, Fortnum and\nMason are celebrating their 275th anniversary.\nIn 1707 William Fortman, a footman in the\nRoyal Household of Queen Anne who was\nselling used candles from the palace, and Hugh\nMason, who had a small shop in St James'\nMarket, began their celebrated partnership. In\nthe store's windows huge books tell the history\nof London and of Fortnum and Mason, from\ntheir humble beginnings as a local grocer's shop to their current position as highly valued\npurveyors of hampers for Ascot and evening\ndress for Glyndebourne! The displays of wine\nbottles, crusty game pies, china and glass,\nblazers and tweeds, ball gowns and scent\nbottles are splendid: they are gorgeous to look\nat but most definitely belong to a fairy-tale\nlifestyle. If you venture inside, there's a model\nof a huge, multi-layer birthday cake in the\ncentre of the food hall, dotted with candles and\nsurrounded by the famous Fortnum and\nMason hampers.\nThe Kandinsky Woodcuts are at William\nWeston, 7 Royal Arcade, Albermarle St. W l, until October 8, Mon-Fri, 9:30am5:00 pm, Sat\n10:30a ml:00 pm, no charge, Piccadilly or\nGreen Park tube.\nPINO CC III C Welcome to the new Pinocchio column. No\ndoubt the old hands are wondering what this\namazing new column is, and where has\nScaramouche gone, and the newcomers are\nwondering what the hell they are doing coming\nto a college which has people called Pinocchio\nrunning about loose. Well, in answer to all the\nabove, I'm the new Puzzle Editor, taking over\nafter two years of Scaramouche.\nThere'll be a puzzle in every issue, ranging\nfrom the banal to the difficult and, as far as\npossible, no special knowledge is required.\nThe puzzles will be along the same lines as last\nyear, and if you have any ideas for puzzles,\ncomplete or just half-conceived, please send\nthem in\u2014I need all the help I can get!\nThere is of course, an incentive to answer\nthese puzzles: namely, a \u00a35 prize for the\nwinner, randomly chosen from the correct\nanswers, donated by Mend-a Bike of Fulham\nRoad (quick plug: There's10% discount on\nrepairs, 5% discount on purchases, on\nproduction of an IC Unioncard there). So,\nwhat do you do? Having obtained an answer,\nyou scribble it, along with your name, subject\nand year, on the first piece of paper to hand\n(depending on where you do your thinking),\ntake it to the FELIX Office (we all know where\nthat is, don't we? Well, you soon will), and put\nit in the orange box on the wall with Pinocchio\nwritten on it. Simple, ain't it?\nI hope you all have a go at the puzzles; a nice\nstraightforward one to start with, so everyone\ncan enter, and I hope you all have fun. Good\nluck everyone!\nThe party season is well under way at Primelia\nCollege, and there are four parties this term.\nOur three mathematicians Richard, Steve and\nTim are planning to take Mary, Mungo and\nMidge to these parties, and, as befits\nmathematicians, they've decided to plan out\nwho's taking who to each one in advance.\nStrange how tastes vary: Mungo -has decided\nshe's only going out with two of the lads during\nthe term, while Richard has decided that he's going to sample all three girls at some stage.\nMidge isn't going to go out with any one for a second time until she's first been out with them\nall, but Tim has decided that if he's going to go\nout with a girl once, he's going to go twice at\nleast. Mary has only said that if she must go\nout with someone more than once, it will be at\nconsecutive parties. They've come out with a plan for all four parties, and I not ic ted that\nRichard took Mungo, Steve took Midge and\nTim took Mary to the first party. Richard has\ntold me that he's taking Mungo to the final\nparty as well.\nSo can you tell me who took who to the\nsecond and third parties, and who did Steve\nand Tim take to the final party?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me at\nthe FELIX Office by Wednesday week, please.\nLast Week's Solution\nAlright, so I admit to slightly ambiguous\nwording, but I don't think that the square root\ncan really be allowed, this really being a power\nof '/2 . Also, I disqualified the factorial function\non the grounds that if this is to come in under\nthe guise of multi pli caton, then it really\ninvolves numbers not consisting simply of\nthrees. I'm trying to arrange a public hanging\nof all those who sent in infinity as being the\nhighest number they could find.\nIf we denote three squared as 3(2) and two\ncubed as 2(3), then the highest number\npossible is 3(3(33)), being of the order of\n10(10(15)), and of the four correct solutions,\nSong Fu of Mech Eng is the winner of the \u00a35,\nand can collect it from the FELIX Office.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

If, after this, you are\nstill not satisfied, then write out\na complaint and put it in the\nsuggestions and complaints box\n(some are well-hidden and in\nSouthside, at time of writing, the\nbox is still in the Upper Refectory; in the Union, the box is in\nthe Old Refectory).

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nTill\nTakes\na Trip\nA cash till worth \u00a31,200 which\nhad been stolen from the new\nUnion Lower Refectory, was sold\nin a shop in Brentford for \u00a350.\nOn Friday September 17 the\nCollege received a telephone call\nasking \"how their till worked\".\nThe caller had bought the brand\nnew electronic till for \u00a350 \"from\nthe shop next door\", but could\nnot operate it because the\nmaster-key was not provided.\nSeeing the IC logo on the till, he\ndecided to telephone the College\nfor the instruction book.\nAccording to Martin Parsons\n(Victor Mooney's aide-de-camp)\nit was the first the refectory staff\nknew about it; apparently the till\ncould have been stolen any time\nsince work began refitting the\nrefectory.\nThe work was begun in July\nand the new till had been left\nawaiting installation since then.\nApparently no-one noticed its\nabsence.\nBrentford police have not\nrevealed the names of the shop\nwhere the till was sold or the\nbuyer because they are still\ninvestigating.\nSprint to\nthe Clink\nAfter a dramatic chase through\nCollege, a walk-in thief who had\nlong been identified, was Anally\ncaptured. The security office had\nreceived several complaints about\nthis man over the past eighteen\nmonths, and recently he had\nactually been observed stealing\nthe wallet of Adrian Clarke,\nlibrarian of Mines. The thief was\ncontinued on back page I WINKING 'ILLEGAL'\nWill Police Turn A Blind Eye?\nImperial College's tradition of opening the year's Rag by playing\ntiddlywinks will go ahead on Saturday despite official opposition.\nLast year, tiddlywinks raised\nover \u00a31,200 in Oxford Street for\nthe National Deaf Children's Society. This success, however,\nleft only pennies for the less\nboisterous collections of the\nMultiple Sclerosis Society, who\npromptly queried the validity of\nIC's street collectors' licence.\nThis year, determined not to be\nout-done, they have made a move against independant licences being granted on their\nflag day. Instead, they are\nextending their own licence for\nIC students to collect for them\n\"provided they do not behave\nin decorously.\"! Undaunted\nUnfortunately, the Metropolitan Police, who had previously turned a blind eye to the\nwinking of unlicensed tid d leys, feel that they must now step in\nbecause MS had officially complained that tif ldl y winking was not covered by the street\nlicence. According to regulations, collectors must stand\nperfectly still and at least twenty-five metres apart, and the police\nhave informed the Union that\nthey will be on the lookout for\npeople infringing their rules in\nOxford Street.\nNot to be daunted, Union\nofficials have decided to circumnavigate these technicalities by\nre-routing the students to the\nKing's Road. Can holders and\ntid d ly win kers will mass together\nto a clicking of counters and a rattling of cans hoping to collect\nas much as possible before their\nlegality is brought into question\n\u2014if, indeed, it is.\nFollowing tradition, RCS students will go down the lefthand side, C&G down the right,\nand Mines down the middle of\nthe road. One participant last\nyear spoke of tid d ly winking through a taxi, \"but having a bit\nof trouble with the ridges in the\nrubber carpet.\" Another student\nhopes this year to master\nhopping his chip back up the\nsteps of the tube station.\nProspective tid d ly win kers are\nasked to appear in great numbers\nat their C CU offices at 9:30 on\nSaturday to collect counters and\ncollecting boxes. Union President Steve Goulder and Rag\nQuibbles\nChairman John Ferguson have\nstated that they will accept full\nresponsibility for any legal\nquibbles. At the very worst, the\nfine could be \u00a325, which will if\nnecessary be paid from Union\nfunds; but provided enough\npeople turn up, they believe that\nthe police will not intervene.\nMike's Back, but Phil's Gone\nDetails: Page 2\nNo.6211I Monday, October4,1982 Free!

Minutes of the Last Meeting (May 25th1982) and the Minutes of the Meetings of 25/3/82\nand 1/5/82.\n2. Matters Arising.\n3. President's Report.\n4. Honorary Secretary's Report.\n5.

Motions:\n(i) Educational Alliance.\n1 1 1 1 1 ( 1\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE FRESHERS' UGM.\nThe Deputy President. As most of you will have heard, Phil Green street, last year's Deputy President elect, failed to gain a Physics degree. Therefore he did not meet the \"good academic\nstanding requirement\" agreed by ICU and the College Governing Body in1972 and confirmed by a test case in1979. Phillip attempted to register in the Metallurgy Department\nand as a Physics retake student, but was unsuccessful in both attempts. At the Emergency Executive Meeting held on\n29th June it was decided that since there were no suitable candidates for Acting Deputy President the job would be\nsplit between Nic kM orton, Christine Teller and myself over the summer. From the start of term and until a new DP is elected I will handle the day today role of DP with Christine acting as Chairman of the House Committee and\ncoo.rdinator for the Bookshop and Shop. The details of the\nelection will be covered by Mary in her report. If anybody\nis interested in the job of Deputy President, myself and\nChristine would be willing to chat to them at any time. Southside Move.\nAt the end of last session Nick Morton, the then President, unveiled a( plan to move the Union to Southside where it would occupy the bottom three floors. I have continued to\nnegotiate through the summer, discussing the possibility of utilising unused space in Southside. The use of this space\nby the Union can only be to our advantage. The present discussions involve the basement space of 46/48 Prince's Gardens which can be used with access from the mews behind\nSouthside. When we begin to talk about major areas such as\nthe old Southside Refectory and the feasibility of substantial usage I intend to carry our negotiations through\na Working Party of Council consisting of myself as Chairman,\nMary, DP ( ! ) , SCAB Chairman, ACC Chairman, RCC Chairman,\nChristine Teller and Colin Cooper, plus other parties when\nnecessary. This SWP ( Southside Working Party), wil j. report to Council and to ICU UGM'S on the feasibility of any\nschemes put forward by College. Refectory Lower Lounge. '.-'\u2022\u2022\nSince the end of last term the ground floor of the Union\nBuilding has been redeveloped. The old Union Refectory area has come under our control and will be used as a party/ reception area., The new Union Refectory is f situated in the old Lower Lounge. It is intended that this outlet will provide a wider range of cold food and hot\nmeals resembling Bar food, additionally wine will be\navailable from the bar.I have been involved in this development throughout the\nsummer and am aware of the substantial sum of money invested in this project by College. I think it should be given every chance of success. NEWS The increase of 8\u00a3% on Refectory prices was agreed before the start of term and is essentially the unavoidable increase in wages and commodity prices. Bar prices will rise by 2pap in t, bringing our average\nprice up to roughly58 p per pint which is still significantly lower than public houses around us. Residence. Over the summer two new Head Tenancies were acquired: the\nFremantle and the Sovereign Hotels. This is mainly due to\nMichael Arthur and his Student Services Office that we can\nnow offer places to over 2,000 of our students. The College run Linen Service has now virtually been stopped\nand has been replaced by self laundering or by individual Hall schemes.\nHONORARY SECRETARY'S REPORT.\nParking Permits. This year, mainly due to various building work around\nCollege, the number of spaces available to students has\ndropped to 174. As already half a ream of application forms have been taken away it is obvious that competition for places is as high as previous years. I reiterate that permits are issued solely on merit, forms must be back\nbefore5.30 pm on Friday8 th October and that once allocated Con the Sunday) there is no possibility of obtaining a parking permit except in the rare event of someone\nreturning a permit (one person last year, in the Spring term - it was reallocated to the \" next\" on the merit list). Sorry, but that is one of the problems of living in London.\nExec. News.\n( i.e. what you are now reading/ making into a paper\naeroplane). This is published in the Felix prior to a UGM\nto give you some idea of what is going to be proposed at the UGM. Due to this, however, only motions given to me\nwith at least the week's notice require d(i.e. the Tuesday\nbefore a UGM - even a Thursday one!) will actually get into Exec. News. If there is something that you would like to\nsee discussed at a UGM/added to Union Policy but you are not sure how to (or even if you could propose a motion then\ncome and have a chat with either Nick Pyne (the UGM Chairman)\nor myself( I am usually to be found in the IC Union Office during the day or occasionally, outside sleeping hours, in388 Keogh Hall). Elections1,\nSee Returning Officer's Report (Yep, that s me too). Geste t ner. Does any \u00b0 ne know how the things work and want to attempt to\nfix three non functional ones currently lying like mournful\nsheep around the Union Building? Does anyone want to learn to use the one functional duplicator? I'll be giving a demonstration of how to use\none at5.45 pm on Monday 18th October in my Office. Insurance. O.K. so you v'e heard. it from me (and others) several times\nalready( see Honorary Scribbling s) but perhaps the reason\nthat I'm so insistent is because I get to hear the worst\nof it. The person who has had their bicycle stolen; the\nperson who left their room unlocked while they had a bath, or a cup of coffee with a friend,( whoops! I just realised what it said without the commas!) and \" lost\" their er tire record collection; the person who left their stereo in their father' scar( even though the stereo is covered up\nby a blanket) etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Another word of warning though. All students in College accommodation are covered( up to certain limits and\nexcluding some cases like those mentioned above - so\ncheck the policy summary carefully) by a block insurance policy through End sleigh( see them at their office in Brompton Road for policy extensions, extra cover etc). You are thus well advised not to accept\" invitations\" from door to door insurance salesmen/ advertisers( some of whom, once invited in, have turned out to be more than\npushy and who sell expensive policies) but to go to their office, or, better still, to a reputable insurance broker.

    "content": "The New Broom\nI hope you like the new look to\nFELIX( those of you who know\nthe old look). The main change\nin content is the 'What's On'\ncolumn which will take much of\nthe emphasis off clubs and\nSocieties' articles. If Clubs and\nSocieties want to advertise\nfuture events, they're welcome to\na slot in the What's On column.\nIf they want to relate tales of\npast events, the news pages are\nthere to cover things which are\nof general interest; things which\nare only of specific interest to\npeople in the club don't belong\nin FELIX. I realise this will\noffend lots of well-meaning\nclub secretaries who enjoy seeing\ntheir writings in print, but this is\nto be FELIX policy for the next\nyear at least. Anyone wanting to\nsubmit a society article should\nask me about it first, or risk\nhaving it savagely cut or omit-ted, and this is what has happened to several articles in this\nissue. You were warned last\nterm, and are now being warned\nagain!\nBB Wolffe's gossip column is\nno more, partly because I didn't care too much for his heavy-handed insults, but more because Mr Wolffe himself has\nnow left IC and I couldn't hope\nto emulate his style. Instead\nthere will be a new ' diary' column which will present a more subtly cynical view of all\nkinds of aspects of student life. It\nwill (of course!) include any\ngossip of the sort BB Wolffe\nused to spread (although it will\nbe handled rather more sensitive-ly) but by widening the scope of\nthe column it will, with luck, be\nable to appear fairly regularly.\nAny contributions should be\naddressed to 'Below the Belt' at\nthe FELIX Office.\nI hope there will be the\ncustomary blend of controversy\nand wit on the Letters page this\nyear. Don't let this week's solitary letter (which will be\nrather incomprehensible to\nanyone who hasn't been following the correspondence in the\nEDITORIAL\nI'm supposed to start my Editorial in the Freshers' FELIX\nby welcoming you all and congratulating you on choosing\nsuch a pinnacle of academic excellence to further your\neducation. Welcome, then, to IC, and congratulations to the\nfew of you who did choose to come here, and commiserations to the rest who are here because they didn't make\nOxbridge.

Anonymous ads are\npermitted, but the form must\ncarry the name of the originator,\nor else the ad will not be\naccepted.\nThefts\nMr. Reeves of College security\nhas asked me to point out that\nwalk-in thieves descend on IC\nin Freshers' week like sharks on\na helpless swimmer. For the last\ntwo years the front page news in\nthe second FELIX of the year\nhas been about theft at Freshers' Fair and it's not hard to\nsee why: with so many unfamiliar faces in unfamiliar sur-rounding s, thieves can pass\nunnoticed where in mid-term\nthey would quickly arouse\nsuspicion. Moral: look after\nyour property, and if you see\nanything suspicious, phone\nCollege Security immediately.\nApology\nToR CSU whose U GM was\nunaccountably omitted from the\nWhat'sOn column. It's at 1430h in the Great Hall, and will\ninclude the election of Queen of\nJez.\nCopy Deadline\nThe copy deadline for Friday's FELIX this week and every\nweek is 5:30pm on Monday (yes,\ntoday).\nUnion Cards\nThere are two enormous posters on the door of the\nFELIX Office which explain\nthat this is not the place where\nUnion cards may be got but\nrather that you should visit the\nUnion Office in the far right\ncorner of the quad. I am a patient man, and Is y mpa this e with engineers who cannot read\na notice three feet away written\nin letters six inches high, but if\nanyone else asks me 'if this is the\nplace where you get Union cards' I WILL STRANGLE THEM WITH MY BARE HANDS. The Phoenix\nThe Phoenix is the Union's literary magazine, and you'll be\nexhorted to contribute to the\nEditor, David Rowe, in due\ncourse. At the Freshers' Fair\nThe Phoenix's stall is inside the\nFELIX Office (on the right as\nyou enter Beit Arch) and there\nwill be free copies of the back\nfew issues of Phoenix available.\nThere are also some post grad FELICE S left, too, if anybody\nwants them.\nFELIX Staff\nWe need anyone and everyone\nwho has the ability (or would\nlike to have the ability) to help\nproduce a weekly newspaper.\nWe need feature writers, news-writers, reporters, photographers, film reviewers, theatre\nreviewers, paste-up merchants,\nartists... in fact, whatever your\ntalents, and however much or\nlittle time you can offer, it's pretty certain we can find you\nsomething you'll enjoy. Just\nlook in at the FELIX Office\nanytime the staff have a few\nmoments to spare (i.e. not\nWednesday or Thursday after-noon), introduce yourself to the\nEditor, tell him your interests/\nabilities and buy him a coffee. If\nyou're an artist or cartoonist \u2014\nboth are in great demand \u2014 you\ncould insist that he buys you\none. You'll find we are very\nfriendly (despite exasperation\nwith people asking for Union\ncards) and working on FELIX is\none of the most worthwhile ways\nto spend some of your free time\nat IC.\nPaper Rounds\nThis said, there is one member of\nthe FELIX staff who receives\nlittle thanks for his work, and\nenjoys none of the camaraderie\nas he carries out his app pointed task. Who is he?
