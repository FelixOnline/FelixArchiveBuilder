    "content": "Girls Against Boys Girls Against Boys\nWhy? By Helen Louise\n^Men can be such assholes\nwhen drunk\nor\nSome men hove to get completely slaughtered\nbefore they dare approach a woman Fair\nenough, some of us are shyer than others. But\nis it necessary to be drunk to the extent where\nthe girl concerned feels sexually harassed and\nis afraid to go out in case it happens* again?\nI 've never heard my male friends comp td jr i they\nhave been groped by a stranger in the bar...\nThe male/ female mix at IC is. a bit unusual - perhaps our social situation provokes\nthat sort of behaviour. Somehow though, I think\nit's a more fundamental problem. I 've been\nhassled myself whilst out around London more\ntimes than I can count on my fingers. Smiles\nand wolf-whistles don't bother me at all - they\nare positive gestures that can brighten up your\nday. But unwanted physical contact? From\nstrangers? I think not.\nRecently I 've had a couple of really nasty\nexperiences. Oddly enough, in both cases the\nmale was somewhat one over the eight. I don't think I'm prone to scare mongering, nor do I dress outrageously or walk home alone in the\ndark. But at 7 a mona Sunday morning in\nCovent Garden, surrounded by people, should I feel scared when someone who seems friendly\nenough starts chatting me up? Or when three\nof us are walking down Hammersmith Broadway on a Friday night - a main road, well-lit - and an alcoholic starts trying to grab us? It\nmight not sound like much, but I have felt\nemotionally scarred ever since.\nObviously there are a lot of reasons why\nsexual harassment like this occurs. It's not\nfunny trying to figure them out when you're in\nthat situation. Yes, there are perverts out there\nwho get their kicks out of terrifying others. But\nI 've noticed that all the men who've tried it on\nwith me were perfectly decent blok es when not\ndrunk. Why do certain males find it necessary\nto act like this when drunk? Immaturity? Inadequacy? Or primeval 'male' behaviour?\nGuys - when you read this - please just\ntake some time to stop and think about the way\nyou act. By all means have a drink and enjoy\nyourselves, but don't lose control over what you\nare doing. You may think you are just having a bit of harmless fun, but I bet you've never been\nin a situation where an unpredictable, physically stronger person is trying to force you\nto do something. Have you ever walked down\nthe street fingering a rape alarm in your pocket, wondering when to start running? Can you see the fear in my eyes? HJ inn FELIX DO YOU SUBMIT OR FIGHT Models a A businessman is\nFOR YOUR DIGNITY ?\naggressive; a businesswoman is pushy. He's good\non details; she's fussy. He loses his temper\nbecause he's so involved in his job; she's bitchy. He follows through; she doesn't know when to give up. His judgements arc\nher prejudices. He is a man of the world;\nshe slept her way to the top. He's a stern\n\u2022 taskmaster; she's hard to work for.\"\nIn Imperial College there are three\nfemale professors - yet throughout the\ncountry women are consistently getting better\ngrades in school. Social leaders and personnel\nmanagement are almost exclusively male -even though women are commonly (rightly or\nwrongly) accredited with a far better\nunderstanding of people. Over 50% of the\npopulation is female - yet birth and\nmenstruation are unacceptable conversation\ntopics. Far more than 50% of television\nviewers are female, yet producers and\ndirectors (nearly all male) write and film for\nthe male perspective -one that is frequently\npatronising and offensive.\nAdvertising executives have only two\ntypes of women in their\nads: the 'executive tart' or\n'two cunts in a kitchen'.\nOver 50% of us are female\nbut history books are\nexclusively male; Jessie Bernard, a\"n* established academic, points out that\npractically all sociology to date has been a sociology of the male world. Males have taken\nthemselves as the reference point, assessed\nproblems and determined priorities from\ntheir perspective and then proceeded to\nconduct their research and construct their\nsociological knowledge on these most\nsubjective and unquestioned premises - an\nexclusion of female meaning. Over 50% of us\nare female - but this workforce, these\nconsumers, these civilians with equal rights to\nindependence still live a second-class life. The\nconcept that the need for feminism is a thing\nof the past, that everything is alright now,\ncould fairly be described as a sop fed to us by\na male-dominated society protecting their\nown backs.\nAs a person I am still seen primarily\nas female - and boxed accordingly. Society\nclasses me according to dress - frump or tart.\nThis doesn't happen to men. Society does not\nallow me to walk down the street without\nharassment - if I object it brands me as\nhaving no sense of humour or becomes\nabusive. Society has\nnever recognised women\nas thinking, dynamic, strong people capable\nof leadership, and still doesn't. Yet in Western history women have been taught to\nprotect their men from the realities of life -women coped with pregnancy alone and were\nshut away to do so. Family illness was\nhandled by women. Unwanted pregnancies\nand physical disasters were all handled by\nwomen. Often the financial running of the\nhousehold was handled by the woman, who\nconsistently protected her man from trouble.\nMen were not to be told about anything that\ncould upset them and women, as they still do,\nbore the b rum of the problem and tended to\nthe man's needs.\nImperial College pats itself on its\nmanagerial head for hosting an annual WISE\nweek - while in the meantime the senior\n(male) staff in the\nbiology dept (in\ntheory the most\nfriendly in e) discuss\ni shing out the\ncrumpet\" as they\nsurvey the photo\nsheets of the new\n- sr's. make to\nc ii u if c ufc ib.sm a a on gsi ibes-selves s. s fJ M ss.\nMeanwhile a career's officer takes a long look\nop god ck nn& s cf ii at' s legs h c&M>t idD ti^ lua^\nno,'lint t$ Ef4;lt fet j it fat i. before- pt- bif ij l\" def in._\" \u2022 .\nmm. les Liter hv IICMICS hc i lor not I. herself u oi is lv j\\ an ,n. ci. HK\\ gain,\nthroughout college, staff who are known to\nhave harassed female students are kept in\nposition, kept in contact with first years and\ngiven female tu tees. Female students are\ncommonly in receipt of letters from male\nlecturers suggesting relationships, and then\nare expected to turn up to tutorials and suk out this person for academic advice. And these women, again taught by society to\nconsider these men's feelings as of paramount\nimportance, are afraid to speak out. Not\nbecause of fear of personal exposure, but due\nto this ingrained idea that we cannot cause a man trouble but must instead protect him\nfrom it.\nIn the light of all this I find it\nincreasingly difficult to accept that the battle\nis won, that women are accepted as an integral\npart of society. I admit that men have also\nBy Fiona Duerden\nYHe is aman of\nthe world; she X: slept her way to -<\nthe top 0*\nbeen boxed inside an\nemotional stereotype - but\nthat is one that can change without\nchallenging the shape of society. What men\nhave been given is independence and\nambition - creative and mental stretching and\nthe potential for advancement - continual\nchallenges, something new. Probably the\nmost damaging box a woman is put in is the\none that says it is what she looks like that\ndetermines her level of acceptance - whether\nshe is listened to, respected and her opinions,\neven her self, valued. And the difficulty with\nthis is that what she is supposed to look like is\n'feminine' - a word defined by males to mean\ngentle, pretty and generally Laura Ashley.\nThis inherently excludes women from any\nposition of power or authority, if only by\nim practicalities of dress!\nThis image is propagated by a male;\nadvertising world, a male film world, male-oriented authority figures. Male historians\nhave deprived me of role models, again\npropagating the belief that women can never\nbe great. Male critics, who naturally do not\nrelate to the experiences of female artists,\nwriters, film directors and musicians, have\nunwittingly prevented their recognition, thus\ndepriving me of another huge part of my\nheritage. More damaging is that female\nperspectives of female potential is not pub-li c is ed, again relegating women to the role of\ntart or mother\nfigure. Reading most\nacclaimed books, the difference in the\nportrayal of\nwomen by women or by\nmen is en or perspectives will be\ndifferent. Thus a male\ninterview panel will naturally be biased to wa males (of the same background - this affects\nclass and race), just as male critics are biased\nto male art. There is, then, a need for positive\n\"I men and women in positions of power, or\nelse the situation will continue to propagate\nitself. There is absolutely no reason why\nwomen are not differ :\nor abilities, women are not 'naturally passive',\nwomen are not inherently anything but\nwomen.

For\nMargaret Thatcher to be a leader she became\nbranded 'the Iron Lady', a derogatory term\ndenoting her loss of 'femininity' - okay, I have problems with her policies, but she was\nan excellent leader. To be this good, to get\nthis far, why should we have to become 'like a man'? There are strengths in female culture\nthat are generally not present in male culture\nthat need to be present in leadership situations - the\nability to talk about feelings for\nexample. Maybe if women were\nput in these positions men\ncould, by association, become\nreleased from their own\nemotional boxes. But, looking at\nthe facts, this time is still a long\nway off. Too many men, in short, have a problem with\nbeing under the authority of\na woman. It is this ego that\nstands in the way of our\nultimate freedom.\n\"If a woman recognises that the only way\nwomen can ever live in real dignity is to make this\nsociety a place where both men and women can\nshare its responsibilities and rewards equally, then\nshe must commit herself to the struggle for women's freedom.

Until a geneticist convinces me otherwise, it seems fM. bulk of our development is\nthe actions, postures and indeed the lives of\nothers; our parents, our peers, characters in\nfilms and novels: And I would argue that it is\nindicative of the still prevalent bias in culture\nand language that 'model' is a female word\nand, bar the Cover of 1 o a ded, a female concern. Whereas roi o model is at best non gender specific and probably tends to the male.\n!*: \"OkoyfjlJIHP say, ' but what' s the* kip*: deal''?

    "content": "Standby\nThe entrance to the Royal\nAcademy's summer exhibition is\ndominated by the model of Sir\nEduardo Paolozzi's sculpture,\nnew fon after blake for the british\nlibrary. The enormous white figure\nbends down to measure out and\nreduce creation with a pair of\ndividers. As an opening object it's impressive although not particularly\nrepresentative of the art within.\nThe strength and weakness of\nthe Summer Exhibition rests in the\ndiversity and amateurism of its\nexhibits. Few of the works dominate\nor even stand out but that's because\nfew of them are by Artists - as\nopposed to artists. To that degree\nit's a large show made up of small,\nif enthusiastic, endeavours.\nThere are some notable\nexceptions amongst the 1,168\nworks. Peter Blake, pop - album\ncover - artist, has a characteristic\nmixed media, h.o.m.a.g.e./'./'. in\nmemory of roger de grey. Carel\nWeight has a series of five oils, and\npop art godfather, Roy Lichtenstein,\ndominates the large gallery VII with\nhis nude with beach ball. These are\nthe exceptions however.\nThis being the case, heavy duty\nart critics will, and do, complain\nabout the exhibition but such an\nattitude seems to defeat its whole\nunderlying ethos. The Summer\nExhibition is more an opportunity for\nthe artists of the home counties to\ndisplay their still lives and\nlandscapes and perhaps even sell\nsome of them. This year 1,383\npieces (including multiple prints)\nhad been sold prior to the public\ndays and over eleven thousand\narticles were submitted to the\nAcademy for the show. In this sense\nat least, the Summer Exhibition does\nseem to have a part to play within\nthe public arena of art.\nsandro chia: sacre cuor e brush and strokes of the home counties\nThe exhibition is organised\nthroughout the thirteen galleries of\nthe Royal Academy; each room\nbeing loosely ordered by the media\ntype displayed within. Perhaps one\nof the most interesting galleries is\nthat which displays the architectural\ndrawings and models. Some of\nthese are particularly stunning,\nalthough whether they are art is\nanother question. Whilst not\nactually in that room, the Future\nSystems model of their proposed\nTate Gallery Extension, gallery for\nthe 21st century, is perhaps the best\nexample of a striking building\ndesign and the incredible attention\nto detail of the actual model itself.\nAnother favourite gallery is the\nsmall south room, which as in\nprevious years, is packed from floor\nto ceiling with small oil paintings,\nand people. The latter is of the\nother, more practical, problems\nassociated with the Summer\nExhibition. It can get extremely\ncrowded, a fact which could be seen\nas suggesting some measure of\npopularity, and even success.\u00a9\nWctor pos more; beyond the eye, i literary reconstruction\nUmberto Eco's reflections on the name of the rose, true to its\ngenre, is not a book but a symbol for a book.\n'Reflections' is a slim A5 lit. crit. exercise. No chapter is more\nthan 5 pages but the shortness deceives the reader concerning its\ncleverness. The title might imply that the book is about Eco's reflections on his novel, 'the name of the rose.. But naming a book is\nunavoidable. Even calling a book 'unfinished' or 'untitled', as in\nMartin Amis' 'the information', tells us something. The title is\ninescapable, but that doesn't mean that it should be faithful. Eco\nnever interprets 'the name of the rose', but invites us into an eclectic\nuniverse of issues surrounding a The, even - novel.\nIndeed, Eco's 'reflections' is a dialogue on the inter textual it y of\nliterature. He tells us how books are always about other books. And\nabout how constructing a novel is a cosmological event. 'Reflections'\ntells us of the technicalities of writing a novel; of all the card files and\nnotes; and of how even writing a simple conversation between two\nmen is cause for concern.\nTopically (but isn't it always?) Eco discusses whether a high-brow, intellectual event, such as a novel, can ever be popular. This\nwhole situation reeks of irony, of course, as Toby Young's the\nModern Review used to sell itself with the \"low culture for high-brows\" slogan. Ah, post-modernism, how can we ever escape it?\nEco is its symbol and for those in the dark, gives his own definition in\none of the last chapters.\n'Reflections' takes less than half an hour to read, yet contains\nenough material for the reader to spend half his life on. Eco the\nsemi ot ici an has not written a real book. But, as the song goes, \"it's the real thing, it's even better than the real thing\". Q MM FELIX00 JU095 "

    "content": "Girls and Boys\nUNPROTECTED\nSexual Exploration in the Aids Era\nby Manor Askenazi\nHave you ever had 'unprotected' sex? Have you\never wondered about the sexual history of your partners? Have you ever questioned the lack of a public campaign for voluntary testing?\nA growing number of us encounter Aids\nbefore encountering sex - our first sexual\nescapades plagued by the fears and doubts\nsurrounding this disease. Perhaps it is time\nour generation considered the untold\nconsequences of the epidemic: for Aids does\nnot exact its toll in lives alone, it also claims a heavy socio-cultural price.\nSTDs have always influenced society's attitude to non-reproductive sex. In the past,\nthis has translated into an oversimplified\ndialectic of Good (healthy) vs. Evil( syphilitic). Fortunately, the discovery of\nPenicillin brought an end to this point of\nview. In just a few short decades a far wider\nrange of practices were legitimised: the world\nceased to be divided into Hedonists and\n<\n^\n5\n^ ^\n^\n^\n^\n^ \u20ac8^^\" ^\nNoOne Can Be Trusted Though we do not yet have the technology\nwith which to beat Aids, we do have the\ntechnology with which to detect it. Why then,\nare we not hearing any calls for voluntary\nscreening? Why is it common practice to stop\nby for a casual mammography but not to do\nthe equivalent in the case of Aids? The\nanswer to this question is twofold:\n1. The health authorities fear the consequences of people finding out, en masse,\nthat they have the disease, without\nappropriate counselling being given at the\nsame time. Some of the specific concerns are:\nfear of an increase in suicide cases, and fear\nof irresponsible 'I won't go down alone'\nreactions.\n2. More importantly, the health authorities\nare afraid that people will get tested once,\nand then operate under the assumption that\nthey don't have Aids, and won't ever get it.\nThis is particularly important in the case of\nprostitutes which used to display 'certificates\nof HIV-negative ness'. Genito-Urinary clinics\nno longer notify patients of Aids test results in\nwriting: results are always given verbally.\nThe safe sex campaign is a based\nentirely on the irresponsibility of the individual.\nIt asks us, in the name of public health, to\nhave sex in a climate of suspicion. By planting\nmistrust at the heart of every sexual\ninteraction, aren't we re-defining the very\nmeaning of sex? Is safe sex really sex?\nMoralists. The increase in sexual freedom\nbrought with it a diversification of attitudes\nto sex and sexuality.\nDoes the appearance of a new and deadly\nSTD (such as Aids) threaten the legacy of this era?\nIn other words, are we seeing the return of a polarised approach to sexuality?\nOn the face of it, the answer seems to be\na resounding no. Society is dealing with Aids\nin a radically different manner to its approach\nto Syphilis (you won't find many government\nsponsored posters which preach 'clean living'\nor the avoidance of 'fornication' as a means of\nprotection against Aids). Yet it could be that\nthe current 'safe-sex' campaign reveals a more\nsinister undercurrent.\nConsider the underlying assumptions\nbehind the 'safe-sex' campaign:\n\u2022 No one can be trusted.\n\u2022 Sex is essentially a 'plug & socket' affair.\nClearly, under these conditions sex in\nthe Aids era is 'hobbled' in comparison with\npre-Aids-post-Syphilis times. There are two\nexceptions however.\nNeo-Moralists: those who will only ever have\none partner (for instance those of a religious\npersuasion). Clearly they are not affected by\nthe current sexual climate.\nNeo-Hedonists: those who approach sex\nwithout much regard for its human\nperspective. Whilst the physical constraints\nmay slightly annoy them, they are not really\naffected by the current sexual climate either\n(e.g. the loss of trust is not an issue for them).\nIn other words, I believe that we are\nliving in an era which may very well see the\nreturn of a two-sided, simplistic approach to\nsex. Those who regard it as a sacred/religious\nactivity can continue to flourish alongside\nthose who approach it as purely physical.\nHowever, for those who live in the fragile\nmiddle-ground, Aids represents a serious\nsetback: if you find the current sexual climate\nof mistrust profoundly disturbing, and if you\nfeel constrained by the rules of safe sex, then\nyou are a member of this middle-ground.\nAs such, you must ask yourself whether\nthere is an alternative answer to Aids, other\nthan the tyranny of safe sex. Could we not\nreplace fear and suspicion with a more\npositive approach based on mutual trust?\nShould we not place more emphasis on\nvoluntary self-testing as a means to minimise\nthe need for safe sex, even in the absence of a long-term relationship?\nNo one is forcing us to treat our\npartners as potential killers. We can break the\ncircle of suspicion.\nWe can get tested. U Se\nSex is a' Plug& Socket' Affair Condoms are a perfectly adequate means of\nprotection against infection from penetrative\nsex. However, most people are not likely to\nbe satisfied by a single form of sexual activity\nand virtually everyone experiments at the\nboundaries of what is considered 'safe'\naccording to the scientific community, e.g. many people regularly have oral sex under\nthe assumption that this is a low-risk activity.\nUnfortunately, it is only as Aids affects\nbehaviour patterns that data becomes\navailable focussing on specific forms of sexual\nactivity. In the case of oral sex, it was initially\nvery difficult to find cases where the physician\nknew for certain that no other high-risk\nactivity was being practiced. Today, such data\nis becoming available, and the results are not\npleasant: oral sex has recently been promoted to a moderate-risk activity by the\nCentre for Disease Control.\nAs long as safe-sex means 'use a condom and everything will be all right' most\npeople live with it, but how many people do\nyou know, who would even consider using\nsuch a thing as a dental dam? Would you?\nThen how safe are you after all? Is safe sex\nreally safe?\nog jung s FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Kl Boys Against Girls\nWhy women are so\nloathsome: an\nevolutionary\napproach\nby Glyph\nPWhy; , apart\nfrom the\nsheer physical\ndifferences\nbetween men\nand women is\nthe male power\nstructure so .\nstable? CT\nI am reliably informed that we fear what we fail\nto understand. However, some things just\ndemand disliking, regardless of the individual's knowledge of the subject. Cabbage is one\nexample: it tastes and smells bad, it looks bad,\nit is so crammed with g luc os in i late s that, were it\na synthetic food, the health inspectorate would\nlaugh it off the shelves. Nevertheless, every day\npeople are seen eating, cooking and force-feeding small children cabbage. Women are\nsomewhat analogous to this. Men are - from an\nevolutionary perspective - irrelevant. One man\nhas sufficient sperm to inseminate entire\nnations of women. But, due to the obvious\nbenefit of being male in such a situation, or\nfemale in the opposite situation, the sex ratio is\nmaintained at 50:50. So women - whom, due\nto the production of single eggs every now and\nthen, tend to be monogamous - are left to pick\nthe prime males - whom due to their mass\nproduction of relatively energy cheap sperm are\nnaturally less choosy and have a preference for\nblanket coverage of the females rather than\nmonogamy with the fittest one on view. Thus\nsocial convention in humans - marriage and\nbabies - is dictated by the females.\nThe important factor in the survival of\nhumanity is thus under the control of women. It\nis a stable system, and thus pro life rat ive, but at\nthe same time it hardly allies itself with the self-publicised image of the 'discriminated against,\nabused and de human is ed' women of the\nnineties. I was concerned that my role as a male, ignorant totally of women (having not\nclapped eyes on a non-relative female until the\nage of 1 9) was oppressive and degenerative to\nthem. I talked it out. Oh! wing ewing e bitch\nMM FELIX bitch moan moan not taken seriously used as\nobject to popular is e masculine products blab\nblah sex crimes harassment no time off for\nbabies blah blah eating disorders 40 times\nmore likely to occur in females than males as a result of the male-induced pressure to conform\nto the popularised ideal female form which\nhappens to be only maintainable in 20% of\nwomen without serious health risks.\nThe last point seemed relevant. I read a book - The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf. She\nstarts with the suggestion that women\nshould be happy with their appearance,\nbecause popular culture is essentially\nasinine in nature, and all statements\ntherein are geared 99% to marketing and 1% to\nenlightenment. At this point she gets paranoid.\nShe starts to imply that men have concocted a plot to suppress women by making them\nconform to impossible goals of personal\npresentation, and that all advertising agencies\nare heinous dens of male fascism taken up with\npreserving male dominance in society like a large golf club. She did not go on to say that ad\nmen were actually aliens from the planet\nDebauchery who have taken on humanoid form\nwith the intention of transforming female\nhumans into creatures sexually compatible with\ntheir own species, although there is a sequel\nout now, so your guess is as good as mine.\nMen are also victims of the same forms of\nadvertising. Look at the Calvin Klein underpants\nadverts, or pick up any copy of Smash Hits or\nthe like. Women speak and write about the role\nof titillating imagery of\nyoung women in object if ying them. Pornography has very loose\ndefinitions, but surely\nTake That displaying\ntheir back-sides, and\nmost other pop groups,\nwho have a marked\ntendency to get their\n'pecks' and 'six-packs'\nout in magazines, ostensibly marketed at easily\ninfluenced pre-pubescent girls can only be bad\nfor the male image. They can only produce\nanxiety in boys that do not possess bodies of\nequally unnatural conformations.\nI started to read a bit more about\nfeminism. The Female Eunuch by Germain\nGreer was the first real blockbuster of feminism\nin the sixties. Even today, she appears obsessed\nwith some sort of male plot to silence women,\nand worse yet she appears to hold onto some\nidea of the moral superiority of women to men.\nI recall an interview wherein she started harping\non about if women ran the world, government\ncould be abolished because hierarchies in\nsociety are fundamentally patriarchal. Combine\nthis with all those 'women against the bomb'\nprotests, and Greenham Common women, and\nwe are looking into the face of a gross\nhypocrisy. In what sense are women morally\nsuperior to men? The most common answer I hear is something to do with the fact that men\ndo not have children, they do not create life.\nIn terms of a biological phenomenon\ncalled sexual selection, human relationships\nneed to be geared around finding the fittest\npossible mating partner so that offspring will\nbenefit from the good qualities of the sexually\nselected individual (as alluded to previously).\nThis fitness is not necessarily displayed\nphysically - say with a 'six-pack' - it's also\nbehavioural. The likelihood that children will\ngrow up healthily and reproduce (the biological\naims of parenthood) is a different quantity in\nthe slums of Calcutta and provincial Ealing.\nThus social status as well as physical fitness is a sexually selective factor. I am talking about\nmoney, but more specifically power. Men will\nhave noticed at the recent Maxwell 'millions'\ntrial the photos of Maxwell jr's American wife.\nHe is an ugly little shit; she is definitely not. But\nhe is (was ha ha) a powerful rich man, so his\nselection over far more attractive men, me for\nexample, is hardly surprising. This tendency for\nwomen to go for rich powerful men warps\nsociety, because, as anyone who has read\nFreud for Beginners will gladly tell you,\nbasically, men just want a damn good shag.\nIndeed, Germaine Greer is correct in her\nassumption that social hierarchies are\npatriarchal. But, if the roles were reversed,\nDenis Thatcher would look like Johnny Depp or\nthe Wundpitt.\nWhy then, apart from the physical\ndifferences between\nmen and women, is the\nmale power structure so\nstable? Surely a construct so easily\nbased on a BMW and a nice arse cannot be so\nsexually specific.\nEmpowerment may only take\neducation and\nmoney, so why are men eight times more likely\nto study science and technology than women?\nAnswer: because it is shit boring. It is well\ndocumented that people would rather work with\nother people than with numbers or machines.\nWomen are twice as likely to do languages as\nmen (IBID p6fa b3.3). Languages are perceived\nas social and fun (give me a pine weevil to gas\nQ It is men who\n* are oppressed\nand damaged by\nthe gender roles\nand not women. QT\n\n"

Efforts go on all the time\nto increase women's awareness, appreciation\nand wish to study science through schemes\nsuch as Women Into Science and Engineering\n(WISE) and Women's Science\nNight at the Science Museum (to\nname only two).\nIn Britain, however, the\nperception remains resolute:\nscience and engineering are naturally\nordained as male preserves. 47% of academic\nphysicists in Hungary are women; the figure\nin the United States is 3%. Where has the\nperception that science is for men -apparently\nprevalent only in English-speaking countries\n- arisen from?\nHelen Haste, former president of the\npsychology section of the\nBritish Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, has a theory to answer this question.\nHer idea is that people are\nreared into anxious feelings\nabout being \"properly\" male or female: very\nfew overlaps are acceptable. Haste sees the\nmale-female polarity in many different guises:\n\"In Western cultures some polarities have\nbecome associated with male-female polarity:\nsuch as public-private, hard-soft, active-passive, rational-intuitive, thinking-feeling,\nscience-arts.

If it is this difficult even\nto classify whether one is\ntechnically male or female, there must even\nless of a basis for the argument that women\nchoose not to study science because they are\nnaturally less scientifically talented.

    "content": "Standby\nrunning on the spot or standing still?\nA wry smile must have crossed\npaul weller' s lips when he\npenned the first track of his latest\nalbum, Stanley road. Weller is\nindeed a' changing man'. From the\nJam and Style Council to today the\nmod father has certainly altered his\nmusical direction.\n'Changingman', the track,\nopens 'Stanley road' and it's a stomping song which is one of the\nalbum's best. A ballad, 'you do\nsomething to me', then shows off\nWeller's chocolate voice as it\nchanges from contemplative to\nrocky during the song. 'Time\npasses' is another ballad in the\nsame vein but before too long you\nstart to realise that \"the same\" is a phrase which casts a long shadow\nover the album. Yes, Weller can\nplay, I don't deny that, but the\nalbum as a whole is better suited\nto midnight background music\nrather than upfront non-passive\nlistening. The songs only seem to\nhave two faces - loud or quiet -and they either start with ac lanky guitar sound or a piano break.\n'Wings of speed' includes a some gospel esque singing which\nadds originality to the closing\nreverend black grape\nty;\nscream esque one might say\nii if;i \u2022 : ,;\n.Kf&iv U:i \u2022\n. ; '\u2022': ' i\":;r \u2022\n\u2022\n- r'i. \u2022 '.::h:'f tik;; \u2022\n\u2022\n?\n\u2022\n\u2022\n.\n' i...S':^ v5;i;i;,;,:;,''': Mkk'k': \u2022 k fi ky k fk'\\::: 'kl% <:\nkkk k \u2022 :'kk' >-.M.; \u2022: : [\u2022..'\"::\u2022 \u2022 :\n\u2022 \u2022 ' I \u2022\nM^ MMMMk'-:\u2022><!\u2022\u2022} :t:,, Mk k'M:. k ykk Mk ky y' \"\u2022 M 'kM-MM'\n1\"k fk: Jk.1!:: \u2022 \u2022\n. \u2022 'iM: 'iM\nk \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022;' . \u2022 ' \u2022 \u2022 :\n:\n5 ' S sf: \u2022 :P:f: \u2022 M.k: MM\nkm da thing (it says here) The\n; k, Si-k Ski.

Despite being the darling of\nthe NME, he may indeed have to\nre-invent himself once more to\nregain what he has lost. (6)\nThere's a five second snatch of\nsampled speech at the start of\nisdn, the future sounds of\nlondon's epic new album, where\nthe creators break their rule of\ninvisible performances and speak\ndirectly to the audience. What do\nthey have to say to the punters?\n\"Stop flashing those f 'king lights\nplease\" And that's it.\nThe rest of the album is a seamless sounds cape of cybernetic\ncool with samples from 'aliens'\nand 'repo man' serving as the\nvocabulary for a post-modern\nconcept less album. Meaning\ndisappears over the event horizon\nand you're left simply to sink into\nsensation. This is music in its\ntruest, purest sense.\nMotifs repeat, fade and return\nin transmuted form during this\nseventy minute journey. I might\ncompare it to classical music, but I don't know enough to do more\nthrown together in a very\nhaphazard way to little effect.\nmolly half-head - shine\nLuke: Not bad in as trang r love y way.\nJoe: Usud\nburble fro i's. i \u2022 . i. finds::n)i.o| s: My Bloody Valentine, wh i cr fls \u00a7\nit ely a good thing.\nI \u2022: i: i.':\\s.'

(8)\nteenage fanclub wander\nonto the Shepherd Bush Empire\nstage in their customary manner to\na wall of clapping and whistles.\nWith no further ceremony, they\nkick off with 'hang on', followed\nquickly by 'what you do to me'. By\nthis time, the mosher s are in full\nmosh and the atmosphere is\nbrilliant. Every single track is filled\nwith the enthusiasm the band\ndemonstrate each time they play\nlive. Then TFC storm through 'the\ncabbage', 'commercial alternative'\nand other from their previous and\ncurrent albums. The hour long set\nfinishes with the sublime 'star sign'\nand we're into encore land.\nFirst cover version is the\nBeatles' 'rain', followed by 'the\nconcept'. Encore number two\nconsists of covers so obscure noone had heard of them. In a mosh\nof feedback and strobe lights, TFC\nfinish and wander off as they came\non. The best band in Britain?\nboy george is back with an\nalbum that touches on aspects of\nhis life and also takes a new\nmusical direction, leaving behind\nthe old days of Culture Club.\ncheapness and beauty opens\nwith 'fun time'( Iggy Pop/Bowie)\nand progresses on through a fair\nnumber of guitar laden tracks.\nAnother remarkable thing about it\nis how personal the themes are.\nGeorge defends his sexuality from\nsociety, attacks past lovers as well\nas talking about cheapness, beauty\nand misadventure.\nWith anyone else this material\nwould probably just end up angry\nand loud. George, however, seems\nto be content to lead you through\nthe pages of his public life. A good\nexample is 'unfinished business'.\nIt's about an ex lover and is sung\nemotionally, without resorting to\nshouting match.\nBoy George has pulled off a very pleasant surprise with this\nalbum and while he may not be a cool name to throw around, you\nshould give this a chance. (8)\nI so wanted to like the\nsteamboat band. After all, it's not every day that a band from\nyour home town, who have played\nyour local pub, release a major\nlabel Ip; runners and riders. Alas,\nno. Within the first few chords of\nopening track, three ugly (to some)\nwords slap you across the face; the\nBlack Crowes. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if it\nweren't for the fact that the world\nis only big enough for one lot of\nRolling Stones purloin ers. Copying\nthe pioneers is one thing, copying\nthe copyists is quite another.\nThe moral of the story is that a rock band who play in their local\npub often ends up playing pub\nrock.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College Nol032 09JUN95 Excessive Drinking5\nto be Curbed\nImperial's senior academics are\nlooking at measures to curb\nexcessive drinking on campus.\nAlan Swanson, Pro-Rector (Edu-cation al Quality) presented a paper to the house committee on\nTuesday to express his increasing concern. \"I have no doubt\nthat some students are spending\nmore money and time on drink\nthan is good for them,\" he said.\nIn response, the committee\nare pressing for a new campaign\nto heighten awareness of the\ndangers of alcohol. They are\ncalling for a clampdown on beer\npromotions during the day, as\nwell as a review of the bar\nextensions policy during term-time. In a report that also expresses concerns of problem\ndrinking amongst staff, Dr Alan\nSwann, IC Occupational Health\nAdvisor, said that the problem\ndrinking 'exists at a level where\naction is needed.' But he\nadmitted that the college\nresponse should not be 'unnec-es sari ly punitive towards the\nmany for whom alcohol is a safely-used social relaxant.'\nGareth Jones, IC Senior\nTutor, endorsed proposals to\nraise awareness of the problems.\n\"I 've been concerned for some\ntime about the effects on\nstudents of excessive drinking,\"\nhe said. \"I 've seen quite a number of students who have got\ninto difficulties, and it's sad.\"\nDescribing cases where students\nhave got into difficulties that are\n'financial, behavioural, as well as\ngetting into trouble with the\nlaw,' he said. \"I would not be\nsurprised if we have a worse\nproblem here than in other\nuniversities.\"\n(See report, page two)\nA quiet day: but is excessive drinking a real problem at Imperial College?\nHolland Club in Doubt\nBY THE NEWS TEAM The future of the Holland Club,\nImperial Colleges social club for\nnon-academic staff, is in doubt.\nHowever, Brian Devlin, Imperial\nCollege Credit controller and\nHolland Club treasurer, has\ndismissed fears that its future is\nuncertain, despite the latest nine-month accounts which showed a net deficit of \u00a313,000. Blaming\nthe club's financial difficulties on\nstaff problems, Mr Dev lin commented that the club was\n'hoping to see an improvement\nfrom now on.'\nThe worrying financial\nreport comes on top of an \u00a38,000\nloss for the same period last year,\nleaving the Holland Club with\nreserves of only \u00a32,000.\n\"We were unfortunate in that\nthe bar steward wasn't up to\nscratch,\" Mr Devlin claimed. The\nHolland Club has been beset with\nproblem bar managers in recent\ntime. One bar steward left at the\nbeginning of the current academic year amid allegations that\nhe had been stealing from the\nclub, whilst another steward\nlasted for only one half-year\nprobationary contract. According\nto the treasurer's report, he cost\nthe club \u00a37,000 for the six months\nhe was employed. \"Certain\nmembers of the committee didn't like Duncan,\" one Holland Cub\nmember commented, \"But a lot of\nthe committee don't like each\nother either.\"\nKevin Young, a former\nImperial College Union bar\nsteward, has taken over the\nposition. \"We anticipate that [he]\nwill make a positive difference,\"\nMr Dev lin said. \" The staff\nproblem is hopefully sorted...\nand,\" he insisted, \"we can absorb\nthe-loss we've made.\"\nH news one&two \u2022 editorial&credits two \u2022 incoming three \u2022 s files: gender benders five \u2022\nboys against girls: loathsome women and who's wearing the new generation's trousers?\nsix&seven \u2022 boys and girls: Islam and Aids eight&nine \u2022 girls against boys: compliments and\nwhy feminism is still important ten&eleven \u2022 extracurricular thirteen \u2022 standby\nfourteen&fifteen&sixteen \u2022 eight day guide eighteen&nineteen \u2022 sport: skydiving not sex twenty 1\n3\n\n"

    "content": "TH cm c nu Standby\ncrumb\nO welcome to weird s ville The power of documentaries has\nalways been grounded in the\nunderstanding that they are fact. In\ndocumentaries, the people who talk\nto the camera say their lines as\nthemselves: no character is at ions are involved. But that power always\ninvolves a double-edge; something\nevidenced in crumb a documentary about the underground\nartist Robert Crumb.\nSome parts of the film are\nunsurprising in their f actuality. Crumb, the geeky, speck ridden\nartist, sketches continually and\ncompulsively. Even when being\ninterviewed in a restaurant, he\ndraws over the paper napkin.\nWe get to hear about the\nexperiences he had in the sixties,\nwhen his influence was strongest.\nEx-lovers and wives swan into view,\nexpressing mock anger over the\nway he treated them and Robert\njust raises his shoulders and laughs\nsoundlessly. Robert Hughes, the\ngruff culture critic, tries to raise\nCrumb to the canon of great art\nand fellow cartoonists discuss\nwhether he's a racist, a misogynist,\na genius, a sell out or a loser. We\nsee him doing a photo shoot for\n'Leg Show' magazine; him and a bevy of lovelies. The editor, another\nex, waxes lyrically about his sexual\nhabits - uninterested in bed,\nobsessed by masturbation, excited\nby piggy-back sl It's all quite standard documentary stuff really. Some information is imparted and something\nof Crumb's strange character is\ndisplayed. If the documentary was\nmade up totally of this type of\nmaterial it would remain a worthy,\nyet boring film, purely one for the\ngraphical train-spotters.\nTragically though this isn't the\ncase and it's this twist of the factual\nknife which makes the film so\ncompelling. Because behind the\nfacade of the professional\ncommentators loom the three\nCrumb brothers and, for all their\nsad weirdness, it's an enthralling\nsight. For the Crumb family was,\nand what remains of it still is, an\nexample of the two sides of the\namerican dream/nightmare.\nFather was an authoritarian\nmarine who wanted his sons to be\nblond, strapping lads. What he got\nwas three dysfunctional geeks, as\nwell as two daughters (neither of\nwhich appear in the film, one being\na 'separatist lesbian'). Mother was a tranquil lise r addict and the boys,\nCharles, Robert and Max grew up\nand atrophied within their own little\nworld of hand-drawn comics.\nOlder brother, Charles, gives\ngummy smiles (sans teeth) and tells\ntales of his mental illnesses, the\nmedication that stops him wanting\nto commit suicide, recluse hood and\nthe continual rereading of the\nbooks of his youth, and it's compelling. One because he's real,\ntwo because he's actually funny,\nthree because it's incredibly sad\nand four because Charles is aware\nof all these things too. In a similar\nway Max gets out his bed of nails\nand sits on it, swallows qualities of\ncotton to clean out his gut and tells\nof the urges that saw him jailed for\npulling women's trousers down.\nIn turn it doesn't take too much\nof this before you realise where\nRobert's art is coming from. The\nft\no0 In a wild and wacky week; tintin keeps on truck in' with king\nof underground comics, Robert Crumb in the documentary\ncrumb. Magpie endures the charms of the brady bunch.\nIn space no-one can hear you scream, on rotation they don't stop you spinning until you ask them nicely. Luke Gietzen and\nJoe McFadden muse over the week's singles.\npaul weller bring it all back home - Nick goes too. Joe hears\nthe new future sounds of london album and says yes, Nick\nreturns with teenage fanclub live before fan is surprised by\nboy george. Vik brings up the rear with steamboat band.\nThe 227th Royal Academy of Art summer exhibition is the\nsetting for over a thousand exhibits from established artists\nand random newcomers. Tintin mingled with the crowd.\nThe ever popular classic book column continues for an\nIpjjJ unprecedented second week as Samin sings the praise of\nUmberto Eco's reflections on the name of the rose.\ncrazy have always told us more\nabout society than the sane and\nseeing it demonstrated in Crumb\nturns out to be an intensely\ndisconcerting experience.\nLet's set the cringe worthy\nscene: the brady bunch have\nsomehow evaded time. They have\nneither grown old or changed with\nthe times. Maybe it's an alien\nabduction or some genetic\nexperiment. Whatever, this family\nhas landed in the nineties and they\nare completely oblivious to their\nnew surroundings.\nWell, until that oblivion is\nrudely interrupted by the small\nmatter of a$20,000 property tax.\nThe Brady Bunch face eviction (cue\naudience tears) and the auctioning\noff of their house. And if that\nweren't enough the individual\nmembers of the family are facing\ntheir own personal problems;\npuberty, dating, middle child\nsyndrome, inner voices. It's all very\nworrying, it really is.\nIf you are unfortunate enough\nto see this film then watch out for\nthe star guests. Ru Paul plays a school counsellor in one of the\nmore amusing scenes, and then\nthere are three quarters of the\nMonkeys (Davy Jones, Peter Tork\nand Micky Dolenz). It's small\ncomfort I know.\nFrom start to finish The Brady\nBunch had me cringing in my seat\nwith embarrassment. It will also\nembarrass and haunt every\nthirty something who remembers\npolyester shirts and flared trousers,\nand those still wearing them today.\nBurlesque it is not, a turkey it\nis. This film is best seen, and I quote, \"stoned and on video\". \u00a9\n\"...I am the pass-eno-ger. .\")\nThe verdict: guilty ot shameless\nf FELIX09 JU II95 "

The drug law-makers are off their heads...\nA User\nHits Out\nDear Felix,\nOver the past couple of weeks, the\nevil weed has appeared as front\npage news in Felix. I thought I'd better clarify some points.\n1) Smoking cannabis may cause\ncancer, but so can cigarettes and\nalcohol, and they're legal.\n2) 80% of students at IC smoke (or\nhave smoked) cannabis (according\nto Mr Reynolds, Head of Security).\n3) In Mr Briley's( Deputy Head of\nSecurity) words, the use of\nmarijuana is no worse than the\nexcessive use of alcohol often seen\non campus. Drinking clubs, are\nyou listening?\n4) Cannabis users are considerably\nless violent and aggressive than\nsomeone after eight pints. I challenge anybody to try and beat\nsomeone up after a few spl iff s! So if all these points are true, and I suspect they might just be, then\nthe current law on cannabis is\noutdated, clearly uniformed and\nWRONG! Twenty years on, things\nwill change as 80% of students\nbecome 80% of politicians but I can't wait that long. So, Sir Ronald,\nif you're reading this, GIE'S PEACE!\nPS Thank God I'm not living in\nhalls this year, Big Brother or\nwhat?\nP. PS As for the argument against\ncannabis, in that it induces\nmemory loss... sorry, I 've\ncompletely lost my train of\nthought.\n[Name withheld by request]\nCannbis, like all drugs, has both\nbenefits and side effects. I am\nalways amused that cannabis is\ncompared favourably to tobacco,\nbut cannabis is often smoked with\ntobacco anyway, thus making the\nargument moot.\nI won't attempt to gain the high\nmoral ground, as I myself have\npartaken of the 'evil weed' in the\npast. But excessive use of ANY drug\nis bad for you!\nI agree with Mr A. User as I believe the law should be changed,\nas it would reduce the amount of\norganised crime based on drugs. It\nwould also make the job of\ncharities and organisations dealing\nwith drug addiction easier. But let's face it, the current government is\nhighly unlikely to facilitate such a change in the law, unless they were\nsure they could make lots of money\nfrom it. This seems to be the only\ndriving force behind legislation\nthese days.\nChange to\nIslam\nDear Felix,\nI note with interest some of the\ncomments made by Alan Bailey,\n(Mech Eng post grad.) about\nstudent attitudes (Felix Issue No\n1030) and other way it should be.\nHe proclaims that our political\nviews should be voiced and action\ntaken to change the world we live\nin. The fact of the matter is that the\nsystem which rules does so in\ntyranny. When was the last time\ngovernment changed policy as a direct result of public opinion? If\nyou wish to refer to the poll tax,\nwell, it's now become the wolf\ndressed in sheep's clothing in\norder to subdue and pacify the\ncitizens.\nAs the commenting editor, Piers\nDaniell, said it is the system which\nneeds to be and can be changed\nbut not individuals and individual\npolicies. Well done, Sir. At last,\nsomeone has come to the same\nconclusion that Muslims worldwide\nhave been and still are rallying\nand campaigning for. But when it\ncomes to students and their\nparticipation in politics, be they\nlocal or global politics, it seems\nthat Muslim students are excluded\nfrom this general category of\nstudents who should and can\nparticipate. I would like to remind\nreaders that we Muslims constitute\na significant proportion of the\nstudent body and thus should be\nencouraged, not repressed\nwhenever we voice our concerns,\nopinions and ideals. I refer to the\nincidents of the past three years of\nmy time at Imperial during which I have witnessed many banning s and cancellations of talks which\nwere considered radical but of\nhigh priority to Muslims on campus\nand worldwide. The Union (ICU)\nhas a bigoted policy of freedom of\nspeech and expression which is\nbiased towards all groups of\npeople but Muslims. The overall\nrole of ICU seems too\nauthoritarian rather than\ndemocratic or diplomatic. I would\nbe naive indeed to imply this\nattitude to be solely attributable to\nICU: it is merely a reflection of the\npolitical organisation of the socalled democratic state we live in.\nDemocracy is only ever\nexperienced by voting citizens of\ndemocracy during the few\nexhilarating moments of casting\nvote. After that, we have no say.\nEssentially, we are free to choose\nthe tyrants we wish to have rule\nover us for the next few years.\nUnder such circumstances, it is no\nsurprise that students, who are\noften impoverished, have no wish\nto waste their efforts on causing\ninsignificant ripples in the vast\nocean of hypocritical democracy.\nBefore some ignorant and\nbigoted people start telling me and\nthe other Muslims to go and live in\nIran or some other eastern\ncountry, I'd like to make it clear\nthat we are the third generation of\nMuslims in this country, not to\nmention the ever-increasing\nnumbers of English and other\nEuropeans who have converted to\nIslam. Islam, its principles and\npolitical policies are to be applied\nto humanity regardless of the\ncolour, race or personal bias of\nindividuals who regard themselves\nbeyond the all-encompassing\nnature of Islam. We know that we\ncan change the system (Piers\nDaniell agrees) and that's what\nwe, Muslims, have been trying to\ndo through reducing public\nignorance about Islam. However,\nfor all the well-meaning advice\nand enthusiasm of people like\nAlan Bailey, London University\ncolleges have proved themselves\nto be against the concept of\nuniversity being a bastion of free\nthought, uninhibited expression, a place where the world's future\nleaders form their values....and\nwhich principles they will embrace.\nSome colleges have banned\nIslamic Society altogether whilst\nplaces like IC which let us exist on\npaper and in a prayer-room,\nrefuse to let us exist in life.\nThis letter is not meant to be a j Edited this week by Mark Baker\ngood moan about the wrongs\ndone to Islamic Socs and Muslims\nin general but just to put the\nrecord straight about students not\ntaking an active part in challenging\nand questioning the system we live\nunder. As long as the two-faced\npolicy of freedom of speech and\nexpressions only applies to every\nclass of people of every inclination\nand orientation, BUT MUSLIMS, I fail to see any basis for being\noutraged at the lack of life and\nvitality in students. People who feel\nthis way i.e. outraged, depressed\nand whatever at the apathy\namongst students should start\ntaking notice of Muslims' activity\nother than with the intention of\ncurbing and repressing our voices\nof protest.\nYours sincerely\nFarida Begum\nBiochemistry UG3\nIt's a shame that you feel ICU has\ntaken away your freedom of\nspeech.

    "content": "Girls And Boys\nWhat Does Islam Say?\nO For a change,\n* you are now\nhearing it from\nMuslim women.\nAccording to\nIslam, men and\nwomen are\nindependent\nentities and thus\nfully responsible^\nhuman beings. W by Someera Butt & Farida Begum\nThe men-women issue as presented by Felix\nis the obvious conflict between principle and\npractice. On the one hand we have a society\nunequivocally purporting universal equality\nof men and women, on the other hand one\ncontinually practising double standards\nbetween them. The double standards that\noccur are most often not questioned. We live\nwith them. But in our position as Muslims,\noffering an alternative way of life and world\nview, those hypocrisies glare out at us.\nWe would like to pose the question:\nwhat is the basis of your understanding of the\nissue of equality? If it is based on a personal\ninterpretation of what YOU perceive to be\nright and wrong (by its very nature highly\nsusceptible to external pressure) then the\nvalidity of such rights and wrongs are very\nmuch at risk. Also, the word equality itself is\nrepeatedly used today without qualification.\nYet men and women are not absolutely equal:\nthey differ in many matters e.g. biologically\nand in psychological characteristics. What\nsort of equality are we talking about?\nConsider the case of Islam: based on the\nabsolute truth (the Qur'an) and the Prophet\nMuhammad's( peace be upon him) example\n(the Sunnah). The guidance for all judgments\npassed on every issue of what is right and\nwhat is wrong has been ordained by the\nCreator, Allah. Once a person accepts Islamthrough conviction that there is no deity\nworthy of worship but Allah and that\nMuhammad( peace be upon him) is His messenger and servant - he/she has submitted\nto the will of none but Allah. This is the\nliteral meaning of the word ' Muslim'. Through application of the unequivocal\nprinciples, teachings and rules of the divine\ntexts of the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah, we\nhave an infallible criteria for all matters.\nIslam has been much slandered and\naccused of oppressing women and granting\nmen more rights than women. Through the\nmedia, the principles laid down seem to\ncontradict the practices of Muslims world\nwide. The people who slander Islam do so out\nof sheer ignorance and malice but they are not\nalways guilty of fabricating the images of\nIslam as they see it practiced. This is the fault\nof the Muslim who has failed to practice the\nway of life Islam has prescribed for us. The\nmedia is prone to use the word Islamic for\nwhat Muslims do. This is incorrect, the word\nis rightly used for Muslims emulating the\ndivine sources of Islam.\nSo, about this men-women\nbusiness. What does Islam really say?\nFor a change, you are now hearing it\nfrom Muslim women. According to\nIslam, men and women are independent\nentities and thus fully responsible human\nbeings. Islam addresses each of them directly.\nWomen are counterparts of men - contrary to\nthe world-wide status quo of having to live in\na man's world. They have the same status and\nrole in life, the same heaven and hell, reward\nand punishment. Just like men, women have\nto observe the general religious services,\npersonal conduct, social dealings and moral\nbehaviour e.g. being truthful, fair, beneficent,\nrighteous and well-mannered. Islam does not\nprovide different moral orders for men and\nwomen.\nPublic life is no stage where men alone\ncan play. There is no segregation of sexes in\npublic domains which call for joint efforts.\nThus both men and women are expected to\ncontribute equally to decisions which affect\nthe society they live in. In sharp contrast, take\na look at all the exclusively male establishments of various political leanings which are\nprevalent in a culture which fights for equal\nrights for women to take off their clothes in\npublic but does not allow them nor encourage\nthem to partake in affairs of public concern.\nThere is no separate order of\nregulations between men and women except\nfor a few secondary regulations where a distinction is drawn between the sexes. These\nare intended to enable them to give a genuine\nexpression of their faith with consistent with\ntheir respective human nature, human life\nand Society. The preservation of the family\nunit and the welfare of children are of\nparamount importance in Islamic social\nsetup. The ultimate responsibility on familial\nmatters (particularly financial support) lies\nwith the husband in consultation and cooperation of the wife. Do not interpret this to\nread that whatever he says goes. This is an\ninfringement of the wife's role and rights.\nMen are also obliged to attend group\nprayers and conscription for war. Women,\nthough not obliged to undertake these\nresponsibilities, are free to contribute as\nmuch or as little as they wish to these affairs.\nIn fact, if men are not fulfil ing their due\nobligations in this regard, it becomes the duty\nof women to compensate or complement their\neffort. Forget Florence Nightingale, Muslim\nwomen were engaging in active warfare on the\nbattlefield at the time of the Prophet (peace be\nupon him). They were not only bringing\nwater to thirsty combatants, treating the\nwounded and carrying them to safety but also\nphysically defending their fellow Muslims on\nthe battlefield by confronting the enemy. A far cry from the generally expected and\naccepted role of women in Muslim and non-Muslim societies today!\nToday, in the name of liberation of\nwomen, a modern woman feels that provided\nshe looks like a model, works twice as\ncompetently as a man, earns half the wages for\ntheir labour, carries and brings up the\nchildren, cooks a banquet every night and still\nhas the energy and mental capacity to lead a fulfil ing sex-life, she is on an equal footing\nthe man. How naive, blind and brainwashed\nthat is. It would appear that intellectual\nliberation of women has not yet taken place\nand judging from the direction that societies\nall around are heading for, it will be a very\nlong time coming.\nBlatant fallacies have been propagated\nby Hollywood. These images are nothing but\nfalse and distorted images of Islam's attitude\ntowards women. Modesty in dress and\nattitudes, applies to both men and women.\nBoth must refrain from dressing to impress\nand seduce. This is not a form of sexual\nrepression. Islam does not impinge repression\nof the sexual instinct but regulates it in a manner which allows a healthy attitude\ntowards it in the defined context of a responsible and accountable sexual relationship\ni.e. marriage.\nContrary to what is currently perceived\nas sexual liberation, the practice and excessive\nencouragement of unlimited and wide spread\npromiscuity and sexual deviations from the\nnorm (homo and bisexual inclinations) are all\nmanifestations of misuse of the sexual instinct\nin a society obsessed with the physical\npleasures of a conjugal relationship without\nthe commitment which should accompany it.\nThe men-women thing is not an issue.\nIt is a by-product of a confused and aimless\nsociety which needs an answer to its iW s. This\nis the issue. HEH FELIX og jun as "

Women can just\nget away with doing something they don't like\nbecause they have choices in their life that men\ndon't have. Warren Farell in his book The Myth\nof Male Power summarise s the possible male\nand female life histories as follows:\nMen: Work\nWomen: Work\nHave Babies\nWork part time and have\nbabies as well\n( IBID p9; women are seven times\nmore likely to work only part-time)\nThe lack of pressure on Western women\nhas allowed them freedom to pursue goals of\nself-fulfilment, not the other way around. Stability in the patriarchal hierarchy is\nmaintained not solely by the proliferate megalomania of the male psyche, but also by\nthe way it enables women to have a cushy life.\nThey can be looked after. They are not\nconscripted to fight in major wars, they do not\nspend their lives working hard to support a sexual partner perfectly capable of doing the\nsame work with the result that they live shorter\nlives. Men do all the worst jobs, men have a far\nhigher suicide rate (dentists curiously) so it\nwould appear that contrary to popular opinion,\n(and let's face it if it gets you laid - which it\ndoes - it will be popular) it is men who are\noppressed and damaged by the gender roles\nand not women. It would be possible to go as\nfar as to say that the whole system is geared\ntowards giving women an easy life, but that\nwould be hypocrisy.\nThe next time a women starts singing off\nabout what a poor lot women have in life, beat\nthe living shit out of her. Jtj\nWho's wearing the\nnew generation's trousers?\nby Jon Jordan\nabout the duty of mothers, the world of\nemployment is becoming more complex.\nFor men, one effect of this new\nsituation has been strangely to reinforce the\nold class structure.

Like all stories it\nstarts \"once upon a time, in a land far, far\naway ... all the men got jobs and married, and\nall the women got married and pregnant.\nEveryone was happy, healthy, wealthy and\nwise. They'd never had it so good.\"\nLike most fairy stories this one contains\nsome truth, some\nmake believe and\nmore than just a pinch of wish ful-film ent. In fact the\nonly certainty is\ncontained in the\nstarting phrase, 'once\nupon a time'.\nPostwar employment trends\nhave increasingly\nmade such happy\nfamilies a thing of\nthe past. As heavy\nindustry has declined and information technology has cut a swath through\nmiddle management, the traditional preserves\nof semi- and unskilled men have been lost.\nInstead the fastest growing sector of the\neconomy is part-time jobs for women on low\nwages. Whilst the Left rail on ad nausea\nconcerning minimum wages and the Right\nas working men.\nThe concept of 'the\nunderclass man',\nimported from the ghettos of America, is one\nthat is becoming increasingly familiar in this\ncountry too. However the job situation is only\none part of that equation. This, for men, has\nacted concurrently with the increasing attractiveness of women within the job market,\nparticularly in the retail section. The\nwidespread failure of marriage and the\nacceptance of single parent families has hit\nyoung men in more ways than one.\nIn the professional classes the situation\nis somewhat reversed. Twenty percent of\nwomen now earn more than their partners; a situation which leads to their careers\ndominating the social and geographic\ndecisions of those relationships. The current\ntrends for contractual is ation and working\nfrom home have also provided some men with\nthe opportunity to spend time with their\nchildren, take voluntary jobs of their own or\njust indulge themselves in rounds of golf.\nIn the future however, the standing of\nwomen seems likely to continue to strength-en. Girls generally gain a better education\nthan boys and women will continue, as a gender, to improve their employment\nprospects in both professional and casual\nspheres of work. But if they so desire they can\nalso chose to opt out and have children.\nMaybe it's not an easy choice, but it is a choice. If there's any trouser wearing to be\ndone, it will be women doing it. | J FELIX "
