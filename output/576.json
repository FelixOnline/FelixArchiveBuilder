On Saturday we surfed at\nRossilli Beach. As this was a beach new to most of\nthe paddlers we were very pleased to see some of\nthe best waves that Canoe Club has experienced\nfor some time. The long beach provided lots of\nroom and well shaped waves.\nThe experienced surfers were able to take full\nadvantage of the good conditions. Those who\nwere surfing for their first or second time were\ndeveloping well, in the conditions well suited for\nlearning.\nIn the afternoon we returned to Neil\nMacmillan's house, where we were staying over\nthe weekend. We were very grateful to his\nparents for their hospitality. In the evening we\nmade a tour of the local pubs and fish and chips\nshop.\nOn Sunday morning we had a look at Caswell\nBay, but were disappointed with what we found\nand so went back to Rosilli Beach. Here the surf\nwas as good as the previous day. However the\nwind was much stronger and colder. A breakaway group led by Trev Jones decided that\nit was too cold to go surfing. The majority of\npeople had a good days surfing, and were not too\ncold at the end of it.\nEveryone enjoyed a good weekend's surfing, all\ngaining experience that will prove valuable for\nthem during the summer's tour.

Led on to the field by the\ndynamic King they were convinced an\nun be a ted run of two games was possible. In\nfact, they slaughtered a Bedford team in a short sixty minute game.\nAt the start IC could not understand how\nthey kept on scoring tries. But eventually they\nhit on a plan of \"running the ball to the\nwings\". Despite this strategy the number\neight, Steer, scored three tries and the scrum\nhalf, Johns, scored four tries.

    "content": "Dear Steve\nIn reply to DV Molesworth's letter of last week, I would like to\nmake several points.\nSouth Africa has been dominated by an oppressive regime for\nmany years, during which time\nthe whites have exploited the\nblacks and the natural resources\nof their country (and those of\nNamibia) to create an industrialized nation.\nNow however they are .be com ing aware that if they are to keep\nup with, the other western industrialized nations, they have\nto finds killed workers from outside the boundaries of the\nwhite ruling class. They have\nseveral options: 1) to import whites from countries like Britain\nandInstitutions like Imperial College; 2) to try and divide the\ninternal ethnic groups and to\ntrain, say, the asians (although\nsuch policies would not be liked\nby hard-line Afrikaaners, and\nwould probably flounder, when\nfaced with black loyalty inside\nthese ethnic groups); 3) to train\nand educate black people. This\nlast option they like least, because an educated black working class, perhaps in control\nof vital sections of the economy\nwould be a very potent internal\nenemy. Also black people already\nhave strong organisations and a great deal of solidarity, and in\norder to get these people to work\nfor them, they would have tp\nintroduce substantial reforms\nfirst.\nThis is the situation facing\ngraduates who could go to South\nAfrica; they will be helping the\nracists and postponing the end of\napartheid.\nMost graduates from Imperial\nadmit apartheid to be morally\nunjustifiable, but believe the\nsystem to be libra lising. However\nthey neglect to ask themselves\nwhy any system changes. Oppressors, who have an advantage\nin maintaining a particular state\nof affairs( which would be\nImperial students' position in SA) do not institute reforms out\nof kindness. The force for change\nis the oppressed group and it's allies.\nIn South Africa the oppressed\ngroup is the black population; it's allies are the third world countries\nwho have pushed resolutions\nthrough the United Nations forcing mandatory arms e mbar goes, etc., the front-line states\nwho offer shelter to political refugees and keep alive the\ndream of freedom, and the\nsolidarity organisations like the\nAnti Apart hied Group which operate in those countries whose\ngovernments do not already give\nfull support to the liberation movements.\nIf the students of Imperial College wish to see an end to\ninjustice, they must become allies\nof the black people, and those\npeople, through their organizations SWAP O and the ANC are clear: they say stay at home,\nto come to South Africa is to side\nwith the racists.\nWith Love\nKevin Courtney\nPhysics PG Dear Sir\nI write in response to last\nweek's letter, which supported\nfirms recruiting graduates to\nwork in South Africa.\nIt may not be fair to discriminate against them, but then\nneither is it fair for the firms\nthemselves to discriminate against\nblack people. They do need to\nto recruit abroad when unemployment among South African\nblacks is running at 25%. Murray and Roberts Group at least, and\nmany others I should think, do\nnot recruit black employees from\nBritain (a British firm exercising\nthe same ra sci st policy could be\nprosecuted under the Race Relations Act). Black South Africans, for doing the same\nwork, do not receive the same\namount of pay as whites, despite\nthe profits that these firms are\nmaking.\nI doubt that many of these\nfirms are significantly narrowing\nthe gaps between blacks and whites standards of living. And even if they are, this is not a solution to the South African\nproblem. I have spoken to people\nwho lived in South Africa, and\nwhat they have told me surprises\nmy own faith in human nature.\nI suggest to students of this\nCollege, as members of the\nUnion, that they are at least\npartly responsible for the various\nways in which the College supports the Apartheid system in\nSouth Africa.\nYours sincerely\nRobert Kelsey\nCi vEng1 Dear Sir\nI write in response to the letter\nin FELIX no 576, from DR Morris. He appears to believe\nthat Iam not Jesus Christ. At first sight, this would appear reasonable. However, I can testify that he has at no time\nactually checked that this is so,\nwhich undermines his case\nsomewhat. I would also like to\nsay that I repudiate the sentiments\nexpressed by Paul in his letter to\nthe Roman s.He obviously disliked humanists and homo-sexual s, and temporarily ignored\nthe teachings of old JC about\nlove( something which Mr Morris has little of for his fellow\nmen it seems). Presuming to\nknow the mind of God is a sin of\nwhich Paul was often guilty. A more fruitful Bible study might\nbe of Elijah, in which several\nchildren are torn apart by wild\nbears for jeering at the prophet,\nor the Incarnation, which says\nmany sensible things about how\nto behave, which many world\nleaders would do well to read.\nBut Romans?! Fire and brim stone! Mr Morris would have to\nbelieve in the devil to take it as\nfact. Ah well, he'd better take\nthat up with my pal Damien Thorne.\nYours Eternally\nJesus Christ\nPhysics 2\n( KC Man n)PS: Try reading Revelations while stoned. Far out!\nDear Sir\nThe magic number strikes\nagain and another ICU GM bites\nthe dust.\nThe call of quorum is rather\nreminiscent of the nauseous effects of a scratched record. On the other hand, those who advocate discretion when faced\nwith in quo racy pave the way for\na vindictive quorum call before\na vote which looks like \"going the\nwrong way\". In similar vein, the\nignominious tactic of stopping\nthings \"going the wrong way\" by\norganising a walk-out (to produce\nin quo racy) has been successfully\napplied in past years.\nPerhaps someone can explain\nto me why 299 students unanimously supporting a motion is\ninvalid, whereas a vote of 151 to\n149 is supposed to give a true\nreflection of the views of the\nCollege population?\nOn a more extreme level, provided290 students are prepared to sit dormant in the\nGreat Hall, a vote of six to four\nhas the power to make or break\nUnion policy.\nI suggest, therefore, that a minimum number of votes be\nrequired to pass a motion.\nTo this end I will propose bylaw changes to the effect that: the\nquorum for an ICU GM be\ndeleted, motions should be passed\nby a simple majority with not less\nthan 150 votes in favour of the\nmotion, by-law changes should\nbe passed by a two thirds majority with not less than 200\nvotes in favour of the by-law\nchange.\nThese changes would pre-emp t quorum calls to prevent a vote,\nand organised walk-outs.\nIf a meeting were attended by\nover 300 (the present quorum),\nthe only effect of these proposals\nwould be to prevent policy making by small votes.\nIf less than 300 were to attend,\nany motion passed would have\nbeen passed even if 300 were\npresent.\nI welcome any comment on\nthese proposals and suggestions\nto amend them.\nCheers my dears and thanks\nfor reading this tedious letter.\nAndy Rushton\nDear Steve\nLike many people, I was\nappalled at the low turnout at\nlast week'sU GM, and in response\nto Liz Lindsay's appeals, I would\nlike to offer some ideas on improving attendance:\n1. Put Exec Mews in with the\nlast FELIX before the U GM, or\nbetter still, print Exec Mews as a pull-out part of FELIX. Then everyone who takes FELIX takes\nExec Mews as well.\n2. Keep the posters simple.\nThe last ones showing the cats\nwas was well drawn, admittedly,\nbut they just don't get the\nmessage cross clearly enough.\nJust the letters U GM and the\ntime and place are sufficient,\nprinted on day-gl o.3.F ix the dates of the UG Ms at the start of each session so that\nit is possible for bye-law changes\nto be read twice without having\nto change previously announced\narrangements. Having fixed the\ndates, fine any society organising\nan event at the same time.\n4. Leaflet the refectories fifteen to thirty minutes before\nthe U GM. That way people have\nno excuse for not coming if they\nhad nothing better to do in the\nlunch-hour. If it sounds a bit last-minute-ish, it'does work.\nI will discuss these ideas with\nLiz if she thinks they'll do any\ngood \u2014 but I know they will.\nYours sincerely\nTim Lawes\nMaths 3\nMore letters on page 4.\nPage 2 FEUX, February 13,1981\n\n"

The\nprize for the winners a place in the final of the\nULU Cup.\nThe match proved to be hard and highly\ncompetitive, but at the semi-final stage you\nmust expect these games. Early on McNicholas\nalmost gave the fifths an early lead when his\nangled shot brushed past the upright. Hardy\nmade several good runs from midfield to\nupset the Thomas' defence. But at half-time\nthere was no score and the fifths were\nindebted, in no small way, to Gilbert, their\ngoalkeeper, who made two unbelievable\nsaves in the first-half.\nThe second half was soon underway and\nlike the first was still deadlocked with\nchances being missed at both ends, then\nmidway through the half the fifths won a corner on the right. Lay stepped up to take it\nand floated the ball ominously towards the far\npost, and there waiting to meet it was Hatton,\nwho sent a bullet-like header screaming into\nthe roof of the net. At last the deadlock had\nbeen broken but could the Fifths hold onto\nthis lead. Dhillon now moved deeper into\nmid-field, Buckley suddenly started running\nand tackling like his life depended on it, and\nin defence Cable, Hatton, Audin and Gohil\nplayed their hearts out, and as ever Gilbert\nwas ready to collect the odd loose ball when it\ncame.\nBut with only minutes to go Gohil was\nbadly injured and had to be carried off. The\nsub, Chown, had to come on cold with only a few minutes to go. Thomas' made one last bid\nfor glory on attack down the right. Chown\nintercepted but conceded a corner. The\nreferee looked at his watch thirty-five\nseconds to go, surely the Fifths couldn't have\nvictory snatched from their grasp now. The\ncorner was looped over into the six yard box\nand there, rising like a colo sus was Hatton to\nhead the ball away.\nAudin latched onto the ball and hoofed it\nfor all he was worth down field; to find the\nwaiting Burns who, having covered every inch\nof the field still managed to drag his tired legs\nand force a throw in. Buttherecould be no time for this to be taken, the referee blew his\nwhistle on a truly historic performance by\nICV.\nTEAM: Brown, Gilbert, Teahan, Cooke,\nAudin, Gohil, Buckley, Archer, Morris, Cable,\nKelly, Chown, Lakin, Rickard, Lay, Hardy,\nSenkiw, Healy, Dhillon, Baldwin and of\ncourse, Hatton. Truly avert i ble who's who of\nIC soccer.\nThanks to those also who come to support,\nSimms, Knowles (and Missus) and Hardy's girlfriend.\nWhataboutBURNS-Ed.\nRugby Firsts\nTHE GAME started with a couple of\npenalties in quick succession in which\nMorgan managed to put one of them over.\nShocked and stunned by this rare event, IC\nmomentarily slipped back into their usual\ngenerous mood with Symes loosing his\nfooting and allowing the Harlequin left wing\nto score a try which was not converted. The\nstrength of the Harlequins pack now became\nevident as they attempted to swamp the IC\nforwards using rolling mauls, but they met the\nchallenge well by applying greater pressure in\nthe open play leading to two further penalties,\nconverted by Morgan. Again pressure paid off\nwith the IC front row starting to dominate the\nset scrum s and a back row move at a five yard\nscrum led to a try by Johnson, once again\nconverted by Morgan.\nWith IC leading 15-4 at half-time, a strong\nassault was expected, after the break, as\n'Quinns had the wind at their backs. This\ncertainly followed and the opposition scored\ntwo goals despite good defensive work. At\nthis juncture a rather un savoury incident,\ninitiated by Quins resulted in Warby having to\nleave the field injured.\nIC now seemed to have established a sufficient advantage, but following a line out,\nMorgan kicked the ball into an oncoming\nflanker s stomach and the subsequent run led\nto a try, which luckily was not converted.\nDespite a similar attempt at generosity by\nSymes in the dying minutes, IC held on to win\n21-20.\nTEAM: Symes, Pullen, Narborough,\nChandler, Davies, Morgan, Johns, Richards,\nLorans, Manzoni, Warby, Smart (Capt),\nJohnson, Davies, Steer. Referee : R Variable.\nDanny Solar\nHockey Seconds\nDUE to the sudden absence of certain regular\nplayers (who? -Ed) the second XI took to the\npitch to face Kenley's eleven men.\nDuring a scrappy first half a golden\nopportunity presented itself to Kenley when\nthey were awarded a penalty flick. Jones did\nwell to let this hit the post, although he was\nbeaten a few minutes later when the Kenley\ncentre forward converted a long through ball.\nAt half-time it was decided to bring on our\nsecret weapon, Superstar Kenyan, international RAO was introduced into the\nmid'ie ld. This turned out to be inspired\ncaptaincy (N Masom take note!) as Ameet\ndum mie d the out rushing defence to score\nIC's first goal from a short corner and then\nslotted away the second a few minutes later.\nA third goal followed when our new star\ncentre-forward, Mahers, flicked the ball into\nthe roof of the net. As IC sat on their lead\nSharpe had to be restrained from hospitalizing\nthe Kenley left wing and thus being ordered\nto take time out. After this display of strength\nIC were rarely in trouble.\nTEAM: Jones, Sharpe, Bird, Pound,\nStroomer, Chew, Rao, Shaw (Capt), Afilaka,\nMahers, Morgan.\nMartin Shaw/Andy Stroomer\nHockey Thirds\nWE didn't start too well, being a goal down\nafter only one minute. This was due to an\nuncharacteristic attempt by Hughes at\nsomething resembling skill. It was suggested\nthat this was due to an indeterminate amount\nof alcohol consumed before the game, but, if\nthe truth be known, he was trying to put his\nfag out.\nThe rest of the first half can best be\ndescribed as an exhibition of unparalleled\ninadequacy, with both teams revealing a remarkable level of incompetence.\nIn the second half, an excellent first time\nshot by a Harrow winger put IC two behind.\nWe now decided it was time to reveal our\ntrue ability, and, surprisingly, our standard of\nplay greatly improved. But, it was not until the\nlast ten minutes that we scored. Mitchell\nproducing a magnificent shot that is hard to\ndescribe, because no-one saw it.\nWylie followed this up, scoring his sixth\ngoal of the season, unfortunately, it was his\nfourth to be disallowed.\nWith true style, IC waited until the last\nminute to win a penalty, this was uno on vinci n gly converted by Hughes.\nGood performances by many players have\nto be admired considering that dead mice,\ngravel pits and rather large holes adorned a landscaped pitch.\nTEAM: Hopkins, Hughes, Shindler,\nRampton, Bill Weep, Clift, Taylor, Mitchell,\nWylie, Woolard, Brown (Ms).\nSailing\nDESPITE the best efforts of British Rail, the\nIC team arrived at Oxford to sail their first\naway match of the term, and lost to Oxford in\ntwo races. With Kennedy and Chadwick\nfailing miserably, only Mills made any\nimpression on the Oxford team, gaining third\nand second places in the two races.\nThe IC team improved enough to give the\nOxford Ladies team a very close match,\nalthough this had nothing to do with the sight\nof their blonde captain speeding round the\ncourse ahead of us.\nKennedy slipped into first place while the\nOxford captain turned her attentions on\nChadwick and Younghusband. Mills could\njust as well have sailed the course backwards,\ncoming in sixth and accepting a penalty.\nTEAM: Kennedy, Mills, Chadwick, Redman,\nYounghusband, Elustrom.\nBadminton\nTHERE WILL be a club tournament on\nSaturday, March 7 in events Mens singles and\ndoubles, and ladies singles and doubles. All\nevents will be handicapped. Persons\ninterested please sign their names on the\nnotice, on the Union noticeboard or send\nnames to Ken Bull, Mech Eng 1 via internal\nmail.\nAlso, there will be a Club Dinner to be held\nat the Rembrandt Hotel (The Carvery).\nDetails are on the Club noticeboard and\nplease sign as above.\nSnooker\nTHE B TEAM beat the A team. In a most\namazing match the B team, against all odds,\nbeat the A team by four frames to one. The\nmembers of the B team who won are Bennett\n(Capt), Machin, Cameron, and Kelly, the\nperson who lost for them is writing this\narticle.\nThe C team (fading fast) played at QM C After four frames the score was two each,\nhowever their last player was very good and\nwon the last frame and with it the match.\nThe position at the top of the league is not\nclear but we think the first three positions are\noccupied by the IC teams.

It is situated at the\nlower end of Earls Court but still within walking\ndistance of College. The house consists mainly of\nsingle beds its with a communal lounge and\nkitchen.\n9 Princes Gardens\n9, FYinces Gardens is NOT a head tenancy but\nsince it contains the only flats that the College is\nable to offer in its own residences, it seems\nappropriate that it should be applied for together\nwith the other flats. The main difference between\nthe Princes Gardens flats and the head tenancy\nones is that it counts as a year in College\nresidence whereas the others do not.\nWhat will you be paying\nHere is a table of rents for this session.

If you apply on your own, you can only be\nconsidered for a single room/flat let. If you are also applying to a Hall of Residence\nor to a Student House, your application to the\nHall or House will be withdrawn once you have\nbeen allocated a place in a Head Tenancy.\nYou may only make one application to head\ntenancies.\nThis means that if, for example, you apply in a group, you cannot also make a separate\napplication on your own, nor can you make an\napp lica it on with another group.\nHOW TO APPLY Group Applications\n1. You will need: one orange form for the whole\ngroup and a white card for each member of the\ngroup \u2014 so a group of four would need one\norange form and four white cards.\n2.

Ktn ere is\nonly one put T in the appropriate space.\n3. Fill in the rest of the orange form\nHow to Apply\n4. Each member of the group must then\ncomplete a white card.\n5. Return the orange form together with ALL the\nwhite cards to the Student Services Office by\nFriday, March 13, 1981.\nNB: Applications will only be accepted if the\norange form and all the white cards are handed in\ntogether.\nSingle Applications\n1. You will need one orange form and one white\ncard.\n2. Lexham Gardens and Earls Court Square\nboth have accommodation suitable for people\napplying on their own. The chart shows the\nnumber of places that each has. Indicate your\npreference by placing '1' or '2' in the appropriate\nplaces.\n3. Return the completed form and card to the\nStudent Services Office, 15 Princes Gardens by\nFriday, March 13, 1981.\nGeneral Points\n1\n. The way the allocation system works, the\nchances are that you will either get your first\nchoice or nothing.\n2. If you are applying in a group, experience has\nshown that problems arise when smokers share\nwith non-smokers. Please give this point careful\nconsideration when choosing your group.\nAll students who accept accommodation in\ndouble rooms and flats will be jointly and severally\nresponsible for the whole rent for their\naccommodation. This means that if one member\nof the group moves out, the remainder will have\nthe choice of paying the whole rent themselves or\nfinding a replacement. Any person intending to\nmove out must give twenty-eight days notice in\nwriting to the other members of the group and to\nthe Student Services Office or pay rent in lieu of\nnotice.\nTo Halls & Houses\nThere are different forms to fill in depending on\nwhether you are applying as are applicant, a postgraduate new applicant or an undergraduate\nnew applicant. Make sure that you pick up the\nright form and return the completed form to the\nStudent Services Office by the appropriate\nclosing date.\nClosing Dates\nfor your diary\nFriday, March 13, 1981: ALL undergraduate\napplications, all applications to Head Tenancies\nand Student Flats (including Redcliffe St) and all\nre applicants \u2014 postgraduates and undergraduates\nFriday, July 31, 1981: Applications to Residence (i.e. Halls and Houses) from new applicant\npostgraduates.\n\n"

    "content": "Overseas Students in the U.K. by C.K. Patm\nA reduction In the number of overseas students In the UK has led to en Inevitable change ot the\nbalance ot educational and cultural Interchange. The composition of overseas students within\nour International student community, which Is especially prominent and appreciable at\nImperial College, hes had the effect of closures and reduction In size of courses resulting In a limitation of educational opportunity for all students.\nOverseas Students Societies\nOne of the jobs of the Overseas Students\nCommittee is to coordinate efforts on behalf\nof overseas students and their societies to\nrepresent their views and organise events of\ninterest to them and Home Students, for\nexample, the International Week.\nThe OS C has nine national societies\naffiliated to It. These societies organise\nactivities for their students such as films,\ndiscos, celebration of religious and national\nfestivals, lectures, etc. These events are open\nto all students.\nFor a group of overseas students, their\nsociety provides a link with home and for\nhome students and students of another\ncountry an opportunity to learn about the\nculture and custom of another people. The\ncultural interchange is mutually beneficial for\nonly by learning about each other can we\nsolve the problems we face now.\nHellenic Society\nThis society has a variety of activities catering\nfor a wide range of interests. Usually two\ncultural evenings are organised every term\nwith live traditional Greek music, dancing and\nfood and wine. It shows progressive Greek\nfilms and organises lectures, for example, on\nthe evolution of Greek civilisation and its\ninfluence on modern values. The society itself\nhas its own football, basketball, volleyball,\nwater polo, table tennis, squash and gliding\nteams. One of the main events is the Easter\nBarbecue at which two lambs are roasted\nover a coal fire. The society is at present\nlobbying the College authorities about the\ndiscriminatory policy towards Greek students\ntees and has obtained favourable support\nfrom many MPs and Euro MPs.\nChinese Society\nThis society has one of the largest memberships of any IC society: over 200 at present. It\norganises trips and social functions within\nthe College and takes part in inter-collegiate\nsports tournaments and other activities\noutside. Every week a lunchtime gathering is\norganised where members can get together,\nlook through magazines and literature or\nindulge in a game of bridge or 'hong-lok'\nchess.\nIndia Society\nIndia Society this year has had a phenomenal\nsuccess in the number of events organised\nand the attendance at each event. There has\nso far been a fresher s' reception, a cheese\nand wine party, bar nights, and numerous film\nshows. The first major event of the year, the\ncelebration of Diwali, was a resounding\nsuccess; people turned up from as far away\nas Glasgow and the Republic Day was\nequally successful socially if not financially.\nThere have been weekly badminton sessions\nin the Great Hall and the Society will have\ntaken part in a sports tournament in Liverpool\nby the time this article appears.\nThe next major function is the Annual\nDinner on March 13.\nAfro-Carribean Society\nThe Society has been very active this year\nand has enjoyed a great deal of success. So\nfar this year there has been a fresher s reception and film show, a slide show about\nNotting Hill Carnival and about Nigeria, three\nfeature films each of which provided lessons\nabout racial discrimination in various\nsettings, a disco attended by about one\nhundred and fifty people and a talk about the\nlife and death of Waiter Rodney who talked\nand wrote about oppressed people of the\nworld.\nPakistan Society\nThis year has seen a great deal of improvement in the activity of this society. It has\ndoubled its membership since the last\nsession. The fresher s and the Eid parties were\na great success together with food evenings\nand films. A talk and discussion evening\nattracted students from other London\ncolleges and professional Pakistani people\nworking in London.\nSri Lanka Society\nRecently the society elected a new executive\ncommittee and are becoming increasingly\nmore active. This Committee's first event was\na cultural evening with a typical Sri Lankan\ndinner and a film show about the island.\nThe next item on the agenda for the Society\nis a Sri Lankan 'Baila' music disco during the\nsummer term.\nTurkish Society\n\u2022\nThe society aims to unite the Turkish\nstudents at imperial College and help them to\nestablish close friendships. At the same time\nthe society works for the friendly relations\nbetween various societies of students from\ndifferent countries. For this purpose it\norganises sports competitions and joint\nsocial evenings, for example, a joint evening\nwas held with Hellenic Society.\nBhangra\nBhangra is a Punjab Folk Dance. It is\nindulged in by the rural peoples during their\nleisure hours, especially at Baisakli, the\nPunjab's seasonal festival, when the farmers\nhave harvested their primary crop.\nDescribed as 'the lusty muscle flexing of a virile people', the dance normally starts\ncoming on stage and gurung a lead with a typical Bhangra beat followed by the ever-smiling performers who are 'high on the beat\nof the drum with arms stretched and sturdy\nfootwork of free birds in an open sky'.\nIn November 1980 under the patronage of\nthe OS C and India and Pakistan Societies a group of students set up a Bhangra group at\nIC. The group has performed twice at Indian\nfunctions and will be performing on the\nInternational Evening.\nThe attitudes and policies of past governments to the presence of overseas students\nhave all failed to assess the contribution of it\nor to develop a coherent policy about it. On\nthe contrary, they have only succeeded in\nimplementing one rapid measure after\nanother, thus creating chaos and contradictions merely in order to gain short term\nbenefits.\nIt is increasingly more and more difficult for\noverseas students to study in the UK,\nespecially since the implementation of the\n'full economic' rate of tuition fees and the\naccumulation of discriminatory measures\nwhich seem to grow day by day. These\nmeasures contribute in complicating issues\nsuch as immigration.\nThe National Union of Students and other\nstudent bodies have for some time held a definitive policy on overseas students\nadvocating the phased abolition of tuition\nfees. However, due to incoherent and\nexpedient policies of past governments, the\nNUS response has largely been reactive.\nIn 1967 there were approximately 31,000\noverseas students in Britain. In 1972 the\nConservative Government introduced the\nWhite Paper on Education entitled 'Educa-tion: A Framework for Expansion'. However,\nno policies on overseas students were put\nforward, other than a reference that in the\nfuture the number of overseas student\nentrants would not grow in proportion to the\nhome students. By 1976/7 there were a series\nof cuts in British economy. Justified by the\narguments that tuition fees did not meet the cost of educating overseas students and that a reduction in the 'subsidy' of student fees would\nrepresent a saving, universities were directed\nto charge the 'full economic' fees for overseas\nstudents entering in 1980/1 and the following\nyears representing a400500% increase from\n1976/7 levels.\nHowever, this 'subsidy' myth hides the clear\nevidence that before any fees are paid\noverseas students not only cover the cost of\ntheir education but bring a net gain to the\neconomy.\nThe London Conference on Overseas\nStudents did a calculation of overseas\nstudents fees, including the benefits to be\nderived from foreign exchange, the training\nof overseas personnel and its effects on\nexport and trade, and the contribution to\nresearch in science and technology. Their\nconclusion was that the overseas students\nbrought in \u00a330m. In addition there are the\nun quantifiable benefits to be derived from\neducational and cultural exchange.\nIn an article in FELIX 566, Mark Wong\noutlined some of\" the difficulties faced by\noverseas IC graduates when applying for a job in this country. Though, it is possible to\nhave a British passport (i.e. British nation-ali ty), an overseas student is still only\nconsidered to be a British subject, not a British citizen.\nThe difficulties arise when an overseas\nstudent wishes to settle In this country for\nnumerous reasons such as he or she likes the\ncountry, the people and believes that he/she\ncan also contribute more from both educational and cultural background. An application has to be made by an employer who is\ninterested to the Home Office on behalf of the\noverseas worker. However, the overseas\nworker has to satisfy a list of regulations laid\ndown by the Home Office. In 1979 new\nlegislation came into effect which made the\nminimum age of a work permit applicant to be\ntwenty-three, effectively stopping overseas\ngraduates from obtaining a job.\nPage * FELIX, February 13,1981\n\n"

Now showing at the Academy\nCinema, Oxford St. (Subtitled).\nA thin, pale figure with closely cropped hair\nawakes beside his wife and daughter in a dirty,\nnoisy room. He dresses, ready to leave, but his\nwife stops him. She knows where he is going\nand pleads for him to stay.\nThe Stalker is a strange emotional figure,\none of a few whose gift is safely to guide people\ninto the Zone \u2014 an area formed after the\nlanding of a meteorite which is deserted and\nprohibited to enter. It is rumoured that at the\ncentre of the Zone is a Room in which all of\nones innermost desires can be fulfilled. Hence\nit is guarded by a terrifying military regime.\nStalker agrees to guide tw o people, identified only as the Writer and the Professor\ninto the Zone.\nStarting off in a bland sepia tint, this is the\nopening of Andrei Tarkovsky's latest film.\nBetter known for Solaris, Tarkovsky is a skilled and interesting Russian film maker\nwhose outstanding visual sense is backed by\nan almost irritating narrative, which leaves\nmuch to the viewer's own interpretation.\nWhen the three enter the Zone, the screen\nbursts (not quite spectacularly) into colour and\nscenes of industrial desolation outside are\ncontrasted with the serenity and beauty of the\nZone. Yet, as Stalker explains, it is a dangerous place full of traps and only with his\nhelp can people safely reach the Room.\nThe bulk of the film deals with the development of the three central characters as\nthey journey forward; the Writer is impatient,\nfrustrated, while the Professor is quiet and\nthoughtful. Their reasons for risking death in\nthe Zone are examined, as well as the Stalker's own immovable faith.\nVisually stunning at times, the film is a little\nlong winded (2hrs41 mins) and yet maintains\nan air of suspense and expectation which\nmake it all worthwhile. I enjoyed it just as much\nafterwards \u2014 thinking about the hidden meanings and implications of the plot \u2014 and\nyet it will not appeal to those seeking action-packed 'hardware' science fiction.

    "content": "UGM Rumpus\nI note with interest that John Passmore has\ndismissed the latest U GM flop with as few as\nten words in his \" Old Preversions\" article. This\ncontrasts with nearly two pages of letters on\nthe same topic in this issue.\nI suggest Mr. Passmore is not taking the\nmatter as seriously as some of the non-paid\nmembers of the union.\nThe problem of in qu or at eUG Ms is not new,\nbut it has never been quite as bad as it is this\nyear. Often meetings used to end with a quorum call after about90 minutes of\nbusiness; now, they hardly start.\nIt would be foolish to dismiss low attendance\nas apathy. Many people choose not to attend -they are simply not interested. Liz Lindsay\noften blames the low attendance on exams -there is a certain amount of truth in this, but\njust how many of those with exams would have\ngone otherwise?\nThe problem, as I see it, is that there are far\ntoo few motions of a wide student interest\nbeing presented. In saying this, I do not want\nto restrict the UG Ms subject matter, but\nwould like to see a lively mix of interesting\nmotions. After all, the boring tedious motions\nthat get submitted from time to time can\nalways be dismissed at the discretion of the\nmeeting. But, firstly you need to attain the\nquorum.\nOne of the Exec's main functions is to\nadvance the Union, not just to keep it ticking\nover. They are hindered in this aim by their\nown lack of vitality at UG Ms. John Passmore\nis at best dull and incomprehensible, Rae Snee\nis barely audible and Liz Lindsay nurses a persecution complex from start to finish. The\nC CU Presidents are content to rant in jocular\nmood about how many pints were consumed\nat the last bar night.\nIf the Exec, have nothing of interest to say,\nwhy should anyone bother to turn up to listen?\nAfter all, they could be watching STOIC or\nsomething.\nSo there are two points to consider:\n(1) How to get more interesting motions\nsubmitted, and\n(2) How to get the Exec, to take more\ninterest themselves.\n(1) relies on the imagination and flair of IC\nstudents and hence is doomed to failure.\n(2) relies on the Exec, exuding sparkle and\ndetermination to solve the problem, and depends on their acting abilities.\n\"Lets Go!\" H. Root, 1980.\nThe War Games\nOn Tuesday, the C ND Group are showing\n\"The War Game\". This is a very controversial\nand well-made film which I recommend you all\nsee. It's an opportunity not to be missed as the\nfilm only pops up now and again.\nWhile the film reflects what I feel is probably a true image of nuclear war, I cannot agree with\nthe C ND Group that it puts a good case for\ndisarmament. Nuclear weapons are here to\nstay whether we like it or not. Total world\ndisarmament is pie in the sky. The only\ndeterrent on offer is possession.\nI agree with the C ND people that the film\nshould be shown on television but certainly not\ntomorrow, or next week. Before that, the\npublic must be educated sensibly of the effects\nof a nuclear strike. \"The War Game\" does not\npull its punches. My main criticism of the film\nand reason for it not being shown on television\novernight is that it offers no hope of any kind\nfor post-war survivors. Unless the general\npublic is educated in these matters \"The War Game\" could be right.\nThanks to...\nPatrick, Steve, Martin, Andy, Colin, Phil,\nMark, Caroline, Shanne, Tim, Dave, Paul, Ian\nMaz and Suzi & Hilary whose article I am still\nwaiting for. Never mind, it was nice meeting\nRalph.\nOn Valentine's Day, Eff, Gee, Aitch and Eye\neach received a card, and by studying the\nhandwriting, each worked out who had sent it\nto him. And so, when the four of them\ngathered in the pub that evening, each one\nrather smugly revealed that he had received a Valentine from the wife of one of the other\nthree. None of them mentioned which lady had\nsent the card, merely that she was the wife of\none of the others.\nTheir smugness turned to an uneasy reticence as it became obvious to each of them\nthat his own wife must have sent a Valentine to\none of his friends. It was, after all, common\nknowledge that after the unpleasantness, at the\nChristmas party Mrs Aitch wanted nothing\nmore to do with Eff any more than Mrs. Eye was\ninterested in Gee. Certainly they would not\nconsider sending them Valentines.\nAll four being reasonable logicians, they\ntried to think it through, and before long one of\nthem had deduced that one of the others could\nwork out who sent each card.

Last Week's Solution\nRose should allow Despard to move first.\nEach side should try to move so that the\nnumber of straight (i.e. transverse) paths\njoining Rose to Despard is a multiple of three.\nA little experimenting should convince you\nthat this strategy always produces a win for\nwhoever moves second, provided the total\nnumbers of straight paths in the whole ring is\ndivisible by three.\nIf it is not divisible by three, Despard can\nforce a win. In this case if Rose moves so the\nnumber of straight paths between her and\nDespard is divisible by three in accordance\nwith the usual strategy, then the number of\nsuch paths counting the other way round the\nring will not be divisible by three, and Despard\nwill be able to abduct her by going right round\nthe circle and attacking from the other side.\nDespard's strategy after abducting Rose is\nleft as an exercise for the reader.\nThe winner is Damian Hassan, Maths 3, who\ncan collect his \u00a35 from the FELIX Office\nanytime after Monday lunchtime (when the\ncheque is signed!).\nCongratulations to him and everyone who\nsolved what was quite a difficult puzzle for the\nsecond week running. Come to think of it, this\nweek's isn't exactly trivial either, although it\nisn't as hard as it first appears.\nScaramouche\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB(5895111 ext. 1048/int. 2881) Copyright FELIX 1981.

Each house\nhas a television and a recreational room, (the\nlatter typically including a dart board and table\nfootball). Kitchen facilities are provided together\nwith washing machines, dryers and ironing\nfacilities. In addition, each House takes a selection of daily newspapers.\nBERNARD SUNLEY HOUSE 108 men\n40-44 Evelyn Gardens.\nHOLBEIN HOUSE\n61-63 Evelyn Gardens\nMINING HOUSE\n51,54-56 Evelyn Gardens\nSOUTHWELL HOUSE\n58-60 Evelyn Gardens\nWILLIS JACKSON HOUSE\n64,66-69 Evelyn Gardens\nRAYLEIGH HOUSE\n14 Queensberry Place\n66 men\n61 men and 19 women\n45 men and 20 women\n64 men and 18 women\n15 men and 6 women\nResidents are provided with bed linen and\nblankets but are expected to clean their own\nrooms with the materials provided. Communal\nareas (lounges, stairs, kitchens and bathrooms)\nare cleaned during the week by part time staff.\nCooking utensils, crockery and cutlery are not\nprovided.\nResident postgraduate Wardens and SubWardens are ultimately responsible for the\norganisation and discipline within a House, but,\nare advised on such matters by a House\nCommittee comprising elected members.\nHowever, most of a House Committee's time is\nspent arranging social events and seeking ways to\nimprove a House.\nEvelyn Gardens and Queensberry Place are\nlocated in a controlled parking area. Parking\npermits (\u00a335.pp p.a. or \u00a310.00 per 3 months) can\nbe obtained from the Council if you satisfy the\nnecessary requirements.\nA Hamlet Gardens kitchen\nA typical double room in Evelyn Gardens\nThe Student Services\nOffice is at\n15 Princes Gardens\nIt was formed from the\nCollege Residence Office\nand the Union Welfare\nCentre\nBesides sorting out your\nac como dati on problems it deals\nwith your legal queries and\ninsurance, covenant, DHSS,\nGrant, and Consumer problems\nContrasting lounges in two neighbouring Hamlet Gardens flats\nFlats and rooms\nin the Head Tenancy Scheme\nHamlet and Cambridge Gardens, Lex ham Gardens, 6, Earls Court Square and 21, Redcliffe\nStreet, are all properties which have been rented\nby the College in order to provide an additional\nsupply of guaranteed accommodation.\nThey are all places which, without the College's involvement, would either not be available as\nstudent accommodation or would be let at much\nhigher rents than those which the College has\nbeen able to negotiate. For example, Lexham\nGardens would not be let to students at all if the\nCollege hadn't taken them on and even the most\nexpensive flats in Lexham Gardens are around\n\u00a35 per week per person cheaper than comparable\nprivate sector flats in the same area.\nAnother advantage which the head-tenancy\nflats have over places in the private sector is that\nthey give you the opportunity to live close to\nother Imperial College students, so you don't have to feel that you are going home to an alien\nenvironment.\nNevertheless, head tenancies are essentially\nprivate sector places which the College has\nacquired wholesale, and so there are things which\ndistinguish them from the College Residences.\nFor example, the College has to pay rent on its\nhead tenancies during the short vacations and\nthis cost has to be passed on to the people living\nin the accommodation \u2014 although 'home'\nstudents who spend the vacations living in their\naccommodation should.be able to claim most of\nthe rent back in the form of supplementary\nbenefit. Another point is that the College does not\nhave the same degree of control over furnishings\nand maintenance as it does with its own residences. The role of the warden or student\nmanager in the Head Tenancies is very different\nfrom the role of Hall and House Wardens.\nGenerally speaking, however, there is no\nrespect in which the Colleges head tenancies are\nworse than their private sector counterparts, and\nthere are many respects in which they are much\nbetter.\nThe head tenancies provide a wide range of\naccommodation, from single flats and beds its to\neight-bedded flats. To help you decide which\nwould suit you best, here is a brief resume of the\nvarious properties.\nbedrooms in Lexham Gardens\nHamlet Gardens\nHamlet Gardens is situated in Hammersmith, a few minutes walk from Ravenscourt Park\nunderground station. All the accommodation\nthere is in the form of flats which range in size\nfrom three to eight bedded units. There are flats\nin Hamlet Gardens for groups of three, four, six,\nor seven and eight totalling nearly 150 beds in all.\nThe flats vary in their levels of decoration and\nfurnishings but even if you end up in one of the\nless well equipped ones there is plenty of scope\nfor re-arranging things so that you end up with a pleasant place to live.\nOne big advantage of living in Hamlet Gardens\nis that the rents tend to be rather lower than in\nthe head tenancies closer to College.\nAll the flats have their own lounge bathroom\nand kitchen and although most of them only have\nshared bedrooms, several have single bedrooms\nas well.\nCambridge Gardens\nCambridge Gardens consists of a house\ncontaining two flats, one for a group of four and\none for six. It is situated close to Ladbroke Grove\nunderground station and within walking distance\nof Notting Hill.\nLexham Gardens\nLexham Gardens lies between Gloucester Road\nand Earls Court, ten to fifteen minutes walk from\nCollege. The five houses there which come under\nthe Lexham Gardens scheme are numbers 25, 48,\n54, 79 and 81. Numbers 48 and 54 consist mainly\nof double flat lets each with its own bathroom and\nkitchen area. There are also a couple of larger\nflats, some single beds its with their own cooking\nfacilities and use of a shared bathroom, and a few\nself-contained single flats. Numbers 25, 79, and 81\nare divided into flats for three, four, five, six and\neight. As a rule they don't have a lounge although\nsome have large kitchens which can be used as\n'kitchen-diners'. Also, they are more expensive\nthan the Hamlet Gardens flats. At the same time\nthe standard of decoration is much higher than\nyou would normally expect to find. The flats in 25,\n79, and 81 are centrally heated whereas the ones\nin 48 and 54 are not.\n6 Earls Court Square\nThis house is situated in a quiet square, a stone's throw from the cosmo poli an attractions of the\nEarls Court Road and within easy walking\ndistance of College.\nThe house is made up of fourteen single rooms\nand four doubles with a good sized communal\nlounge and a kitchen. Most of the rooms are\ncentrally heated and the standards of decoration\nand furnishings are above average.\nTwo bedrooms in Earls Court Square\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Comrade Editor\nIn defence of the people's rights, I feel compelled to put pen\nto paper with regard to the\ndisgraceful public performance of\nour comrade, Honorary Secretary,\nLiz Lindsay, a member of the\nExecutive of the people, more\ncommonly known as the 'gang of\nthree'. On cross examination at\nthe last U GM on her lamentable\nrecord on U GM attendance, only one of which has been\nquo rate this year, instead of\ngiving any explanation whatsoever to the assembled few, she\nproceeded to behave like an Irish\nversion of the Mount St Helens\nvolcano. This performance clearly satisfied no one and her\nonly suggestion of setting up yet\nanother committee is clearly ludicrous. As our comrade editor\nhas previously pointed out in our\npeople's weekly, FELIX, the last\nU GM was badly planned, poorly\nattended and had very little of\ninterest to the bulk of the student\nbody. While I accept that El Salvador may be important to\nLatin American Soc and the\nForeign Office, it has very little\nin common with the average IC\nstudent. For a change let's see a little positive independant thought from the executive to\nsolve this problem, instead of\ntrying to blame the situation on\neveryone but themselves.\nLong live the revolution.\nComrade Bill the Mole. Dear Sir\nIt is hard to make any criticisms of the way the Union is\ngoing without it being interpreted\nas some sort of narrow personal\nattack. Clearly my comments at\nthe last U GM have been mis-understood. I do not think that\nthe frequently low attendance of\nUG Ms is due to insufficient publicity or any other technical\nmatter. In this area I feel that all\nconcerned( Liz Lindsay in particular) have worked hard\nand have done all that can be\nexpected of them. Neither do I approve of people calling quorum\nas a matter of course. Such actions should be reserved for\ncontroversial issues where the low\nattendance means that it would\nbe wrong to take a decision that\nsome people would strongly oppose.\nThe point is that UG Ms are\nonly a part of a process. Unless\nthere are campaigns or issues that\nare being argued about and acted upon in between UG Ms, no amount of publicity will attract people. It is worthwhile\nnoting that the previous U GM had an enormous attendance\n(around 600). This was because\nthree issues were to be discussed\naround which there had previously been activity and controversy: FELIX' s editorial policy,\nnuclear disarmament issues, and\nthe South African connection\nwith the Nuclear Technology\ncourse. It was in this context that\nI pointed out the inadequate\naction on previous U GM decisions\n(for instance, on overseas student\nfees). Clearly this is not solely the\nsabbaticals' responsibility, but\nthey should provide a lead and\nbe clear about what is to be done\nand who (not necessarily them-selves) will do it. In fact things\nhave been left in the air. Some\nsense of urgency is required.\nThe main point is not that the\nsabbaticals are not working hard.\nIam sure they are. But there is a danger that all their time is spent\nin administrative details so that\nopportunities to innovate or\nchange things, or take part in\nbroader movements, are ne g lec ted. They must recognise that\nthis problem exists before there is\nany chance of overcoming it.\nIt is an exasperating habit to\nblame low attendances on \"too\nmuch politics\". The only solution\nis to have a campaigning Union.\nInstead of blaming things on\nthose who are already active on\nissues about which they feel\nstrongly it would be helpful if\nother people identified some of\nthose much referred to \"relevant\" issues and got moving on\nthem.\nIn view of the above, I don't feel that the proposed working\nparty on U GM attendance is\nrelevant to the problem and will\nnot join it. However, along with\nmany othe r people in C ND, Overseas students societies, Anti Apartheid club, I CW A, Amnesty\nInternational, WIST, Socialist\nSociety, Labour Club, Liberal\nClub, external affairs committee,\netc., I shall continue to work to\nmake UG Ms meaningful and\nwell attended.\nTours sincerely\nOwen Greene\nPhysics PG Dear Sir\nThe amount of interest in the\nDisarmament issue seen in the\nhigh attendance at last term'sU GM, and the fact that the\nmotion proposing affiliation to\nC ND was passed by such a large\nmajority, showed clearly the\ndepth of feeling within College\nover this subject.\nIt has now emerged ( FELIX575), two UG M's later, that\nthere may be a legal problem in\naffiliating the Union to the\nnational C ND. Union a ff il ation to national groups is hardly without precedent, yet your report implies it has been successfully challenged just once;\nin 1972. The President should\ntherefore urgently inquire into\nthe means employed by other\nUnions to avoid court cases. It\nmay be possible, for example, to\npay affiliation fees indirectly \u2014\nfrom the profits produced by\npinball machines, say, or by\nsetting up a fund from student\ndonations.\nInstead of procrastinating surely the President, when mandated to carry through a certain policy, should employ all\nthe means at his disposal to do so\n\u2014 and keep the Union and relevant groups within it in formed as to his progress.\nTours sincerely\nMartin Casey\nICC ND/ Physics PG Dear Stephen\nI should like to protest (with all\npossible vehemence) about the\nscurrilous( and totally pre ce dented) attack on the integrity of\nthe IC Union President which\nappeared in your most recent\nEditorial. After all, there are still\nfive months left, and somebody\nmight call for a re-run.\nPersonally, I would be devastated to receive any proof that a single suspect action had escaped\nthe attention of eagle-eyed RJ Stotesbury and his tireless team\nduring last year's sabbat ica K elections.\nHello to all bemused first\nyears!!\nMick Berry\nSoc and Econ Studies PG Dear Sir\nIn your Editorial of last week,\nyou implied that John( Dogs of\nWar) Passmore's election camp a ign was not totally above board. If there was any illegality\nand you knew of it and yet chose\nnot to point it out to the elections\ncommittee at that time, does this\nimply guilt by conspiracy on\nyour part?\nTours sincerely\nRuth Hildebrand Ed's Note\nIn reply, may I remind you of the\nwell known adage:' Jude x dam natur cum noc en sab sol vi tur'.

MAGNUS PYKE \"IS m: SUCCESS\nYesterday afternoon a group of 300 students and\nstaff gathered in the Pippard Lecture Theatre\nto hear Dr. Magnus Pyke, a scientist noted\nfor his arm-waving gestures on television\ngive a lecture on \" Understandability\nof Science\".\nHe said he had been involved\ninterpretation^,^ **\u00bb\nof science to \\ \u2014\nordinary people yr,~< W his television\nlor about _\u00bb-~ \u2022 ^ ^ \u2022 \u2022 ^ ^\njig f^ \u2022 ^ r x pert ment s on water\neight * y**^S \u00b0 ' nS down plug holes.

Scientists should\npublish their work, as not doing\nso held back the development of\nmankind.\nDr Fyke's lecture was punctuated with many witty remarks\nwhich brought roars of laughter\nfrom his audience. Although he\nhad no apparatus, he used his\narms often to explain further a particular point. He received\nloud and long applause at the\nend. and the lei tine was enjoyed\n\"enormously by those people\nthere, although it was suggested\nthat a larger theatre would have\nbeen more appropriate.\nScience. way of thinking.

Hopefully, this will help you to find\nthe accommodation which best suits your\nparticular requirements and save you from the\naggravation of making applications which are\nunlikely to be successful.\nSince most people already have a pretty good\nidea of what the Halls of Residence and the\nStudent Houses are like, this guide gives a particular emphasis to the Head Tenancy flats\nand rooms, i.e. Hamlet Gardens, Lex ham Gardens, Earls Court Square and Redcliffe\nStreet.\nApplication forms for next session are available\nnext week from the Student Services Office, 15\nPrinces Gardens and should be completed and\nreturned by Friday, March 13. The results of\nthese applications should be known by the early\npart of the summer term.\nApplications from new applicant postgraduates\nwho are applying to live in a Hall or House have a later closing date \u2014 Friday, July 31.\nHow College Accomodation\nis allocated\n(A) Residences\n(i.e. Halls, Houses and 9 Princes Gardens\nflats)\nThe following extract from the 'Imperial College\nStudent Residence Halls and Houses Regulations\nand Information' makes it all crystal clear. Note\nparticularly the underlined bits.\nApplications for residence from students will be considered in S the following cater go ries:a) First year undergraduates are admitted to residence on the 1\nrecommendation of the College departments. The allocation 1\nof first year places among the Halls and Houses and between\ndepartments is regulated by the Students' Residence Corn\nmitte e.b) Undergraduate new residents will be selected by a random\nmethod.\n^ c) Undergraduate and postgraduate read missions are selected b v]a sub-committee of each Hall and House Committee whose\nmembers have not applied for a further year in residence,\nd) Postgraduate new residents are admitted to residence on the\nrecommendation of the College departments. Junior\nResearch Assistants * are also eligible to apply within this\ncategory.\nWardens shall have the power to refuse any application to\ntheir Hall or House after d is uc s sion with the Hall or House\nCommittee.\nA certain number of places will be reserved for medical,\nwelfare and compassionate cases as recommended by the\nMedical Officer or Student Counsellor in consultation with\nWardens.\n\" Members of Staff who, for administrative reasons, receive\na net salary comparable to a standard UK postgraduate\nstudent award.\n5 The following principles shall be followed in considering applications for residence:\na) The normal period of residence in any Hall or House for\nstudent members shall be one year.\nb) Not more than 10 per cent may be selected for a second\nyear's residence, but no such members may reside for more\nthan two years in Halls or Houses except as provided in 5(d) below and Selkirk and Vickers' Scholars.\nc) The proportion of postgraduates in any Hall or House shall\nbe about 15 per cent of the student members; any IC undergraduate becoming a postgraduate will re qualify for entry.\nd) if a student, having been resident for two years, is elected an\nofficer of the Union, as listed in Regulation 2 above, he shall\nbe permitted to reside for a third year, but none other than\nthe President, Deputy President and the Secretary shall be\npermitted to reside in Halls or Houses for more than three\nyears.\ne) In applying Regulations 5(b) and 5(d) above, students who\ntake up residence during the first half-session shall be considered as re-applicants for any further applications.\nStudents taking up residence during the second half-session\nwill be considered as new applicant for the following app li cation.\nApplying as a new applicant\nThere is room in the Halls and Houses for about\n180 new applicants from second and third year\napplicants. Priority is given to third years as it is\ntheir last chance to spend a year in Residence as\nan undergraduate. Because of the fall in student\nnumbers, it is hoped that this year it will be\npossible to give all third year new applicants\nplaces but this will not be known for certain until\nall the applications have been received.\nApplying as a re-applicant\nThe reason for having a re-applicant system is\nthat it is thought that if there are a handful of\npeople in each hall or house who have had the\nexperience of living in residence and have shown\nthat they have a contribution to make to the life of\nthe community, then this will make any given Hall\nor House a happier place to live in.\nAs it says in the regulations, re-applicants are\nchosen by a 'sub-committee of each Hall and\nHouse Committee whose members have not\napplied for a further year in residence'.\nThe significance of these regulations to your\npersonal strategy for getting a place to live for\nnext year lies in the fact that unless the\ncommittee which does the selection knows who\nyou are, your chances of succeeding in getting in\nas a re-applicant must be non-existant. So, for\nexample, if you living in a student house this year,\nit would in most cases be a waste of time applying\nto live next year in Hall.\nSimilarly, anyone who lived in residence in their\nfirst year would find it very difficult to get back for\ntheir third year if they had lost contact j vith the\npeople in that particular Hall or House in the\nintervening year.\n(B) Head Tenancies\n(Not 9, Princes Gardens)\nHead tenancies are not affected by the above\nregulations and as a result the main thing to\nconcentrate on if you are applying other than on\nyour own, is getting together a group of people\nwho you feel you will be able to peacefully co-exist\nwith for a whole session!\nHalls of Residence\nBeit Hall\nWarden: Dr C Halls\nThis consists of the 'Old' and 'New' Hostels, both\nsituated in the Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, with accommodation for 67 men and 48\nwomen.

Each resident has an individual study-bedroom fitted with a wash-basin and there is\na kitchenette on each floor. A large common\nroom is provided on the ground floor. The\nWarden and Sub-Warden live on the premises.\nLinstead Hall\nWarden: Dr MD Carabine\nLinstead Hall, together with its extension, is\nlocated on the east side of Prince's Gardens and\naccommodates 174 men and 24 women in both\nsingle and double study bedrooms. This particular Hall provides an evening meal on weekdays. Each set of rooms has its own\nkitchenette. Social and recreational areas are\nlocated on two gallery levels with the dining room\non the ground floor. The Warden and two SubWardens live on the premises.\nSouthside Halls, Prince's Gardens\nThese four Halls accommodate 382 men and\nwomen as follows:\nFALMOUTH HALL KEO GH HALL SELKIRK HALL TIZARD HALL87 men and 31 women\n72 men\n40 men and 32 women\n120 men\nEach resident has an individual study-bedroom\nfitted with a wash-basin.

    "content": "PWP\nSlams\nSouthside\nRefectory\nTHE UNION Permament Wor king Party has made a number of\nrecommendations concerning College refectories. These resulted from investigations after\nthe planned changes to the\nSouthside Refectory complex were suggested by College, which\nincluded proposals to incorporate\na post-experience centre in place\nof the Refectory.\nThe committee agrees that the\nSouthside outlet w hould be\nheavily reduced, the 3 0 0 / 4 0 0\nmeals it serves per day could\neasily be supplied by the other\nrefectories. The Sherfield Refectory, the committee argues, is\nought to remain almost the same\nstill able to cater for formal functions. It is proposed that the\nButtery should stop serving hot\nfood and instead s^r ve snack\nfoods and salads, though it\nshould be open all day to provide\na continuous service. P WP feel\nthat the Union refectory is\nsatisfactory and that here there is\nno real need for change.\nThese recommendations still\nrequire Council approval before\nthey become official Union policy.\nProfSlams\nNuclear\nArms Race\nLAST THURSDAY, Prof Pentz,\nof the Open University, gave a talk about the present status of\nthe nu ce lar arms race. He argued\nthat the US has consistently led\nthe race, with the USSR frantically trying to catch up. We are\nnow at a critical point, since the\nintroduction of further missiles\nand particularly Cruise and MX systems would threaten to make\nthe arms race irreversible. This is\n\u2022because it is very difficult for\neither side to verify that the\nopposite side is keeping to an\narms limitation agreement when\nthe missiles are very small or\nmobile. He concluded by emphasising the role people with a scientific education should play\nin countering the distortions and\nmisuse of statistics which regularly occur in this area. The lecture was well attended and\nlively.\nRag\nRumpus\nLAST SATURDAY, IC's inter-Hall Rag competition took place.\nStudents from all Halls participated in the hope of winning a free barrel of beer for their Hall. Some went to Trafalgar Square\nto be \"foamed\" for 20p, whilst\nothers stuck to the more usual\nhaunt of Harrods. The event was\n\" won\" by an ad-hoc group from\nChemistry 2, not living in Hall, who collected over \u00a3290.\nFELIX moles discovered that\nat least three Halls had cons ide red cheating by adding amounts to their total, from Hall funds, in the hope of winning by\nunderhand scheming and devious methods.\nStudent\nJournalists\nKnees-up\nTHE LONDON Students' Journalists' Group are holding a conference at the London College\nof Printing on Saturday, eight\nFELIX representatives are attending. The day long conference is modelled on the recent\nNUS Student Journalist Conference, at which FELIX also was\nrepresented. The Conference will\ncover all areas of newspaper\nproduction, including advertising, layout, sources of in form a tion, journalism and the law,\nsub editing, writing andre viewing, pictures and pitch f hg at\nan audience. In the evening, the\nInaugural AGM of the group will\nbe held.\nStop\nThief!\nA FLAT in 9 Princes Garden was\nbroken into on Wednesday afternoon. The door was jem mie d, and an amount of small jewellery\nwas stolen. The theft occured\nbetween 4:30 and 5:00pm on\nWednesday. The victims asked\nanyone who saw suspicious people in Princes Gardens to get\nin touch with the police. This was\nthe second theft in two days from\nIC premises. An Opsoc member\nhad \u00a350 stolen on the Tuesday\nafternoon from some unattended\npossessions in the Union Building.\nThe message seems to be 'Watch\nOut \u2014 There's a thief about\".\nContinued from front page.\nUltra Vires or not?\nwhatsoever of interest to its members'\". He went on by saying \"the union is,\nclearly, an educational charity and the officers of the union who have\npower to dispose of the union's funds are, clearly, trustees of those funds for\ncharitable educational purposes. It is not, therefore, open to the union, by a purported amendment of its constitution, to authorise the use of the union's funds for the purpose of promoting any object which may happen to\ninterest the members of the union regardless of whether such object is\ncharitable and educational or not . . . that is a result which no charitable\nbody such as the union is capable of achieving.\"\n\"It is plainly proper and desirable that students should consider and\ndiscuss social and economic problems of the day; that is part of the\neducational process.\" Counsel for the defendent s submitted that \"students\nare not bound to confine expenditure to matters which . . . are more\ndirectly concerned with their own personal interest. It is right that they\nshould be able to give up a reasonable part of their union's money s as a concrete expression of their corporate views. . . It should not be confined to\noral expression, but should include a reasonable financial expression\".\nThe Judge said: \" I do not think that he is right as a matter of law. If the\nmembers of the union wish to express their views financially, that money\nshould come from their own personal funds and not from trust money.\nAdmittedly, part of the educational process is research, discussion, debate\nand reaching a corporate conclusion on social and economic problems, but,\nin my view, the provision of money to finance the adoption outside the\nuniversity of that corporate conclusion does not form any part of the\neducational process.\"\n\" I turn to the proposed milk campaign fund. That is, admittedly,\naccording to the literature, a political purpose. It is, therefore, inevitably\nnot a charitable purpose, educational or otherwise, because political\npurposes are not charitable. It follows on that count alone that charitable\nfunds cannot lawfully be used for setting up such a fund. Charitable funds\ncannot be applied to non-charitable purposes\".\nExpert advice\nFELIX sought the opinion of a member of the Inns of Court on this\nmatter. He referred to this case, and the Charity Commission report for\n1972. He said that this all revolved around the principle of \"es jude m generis\" that limits the way in which words which indicate various fields\ncan be construed. For instance, ICU by-laws lb and lc give the Union\nobjects as \"the encouragement of interest by students in matters outside the\nCollege curriculum, especially cultural and athletic interests\" and \"the\nprovision of a corporate body of students . . . to represent and to safeguard\nand advance the interests and welfare of the students of the Imperial\nCollege\". Whilst it may be argued that a campaign to save ICU from\nnuclear obliteration would \"safeguard the interests and welfare of the\nstudents\", the words could not be interpreted in a law court in this way.\nAlso, the President cannot place bets on Irish sweepstakes with Union\nmoney. He said it was not charitable to advocate reform, and added \"for\nsuch an overtly political and controversial group as C ND, the decision was\nclear cut, such payments are ultra vire s\". He said the case was heard in the\ncourt of first instance, i.e. no appeal was made against it. It stands as legal\nprecedent, and any judge hearing a similar application would have to\nfollow that precedent.\nPresident to be sued\nMeanwhile in Leeds, the University Union President, Chris Shenton, is\nlacing legal action because he has not made payments that he claims are\nultra vire s. This matter arose in October when the Third World Society\nproposed a motion to donate \u00a3700 to build a school in Gambia. There is a difference of opinion between the Union solicitors, the law department,\nand the college solicitors as to if this would be ultra vire s. A leading\nmember of the Third World Society is filing a Court Order against Mr Shenton, asking that he be directed to allow the donation to be made. Mr Shenton said \"It is the charitable status and not the Union constitution\nwhich is preventing the donation to Gambia\". The NUS has published a pamphlet called \"Student Unions and Ultra\nVires\". It states: \"It should be stressed that in considering any payments by\ncharitable students' unions the courts would refer to objections acceptable\nto the Charity Commisioners, and not solely the union's own constitutional\nobjects clause . . . To act as if legal constraints on unions do not really exit .\n. . would not only be shortsighted, but also highly irresponsible to the\nmembership. If any one studen s union is found by the courts to be making\nultra vire s payments this would have implications for the whole student\nmovement\".\nFELIX asked John Passmore if he had heard from the Union Solicitors.\nHe rang the solicitor on Wednesday afternoon, who said that there was\nnothing in the bylaws either way, and he would have to read the\nconstitution before expressing an opinion. Mr Passmore presumed the\nsolicitors had read the rel event case.\nThe affiliation fee ICU would have to pay is only \u00a310, but most people\ninvolved agree that \"it's the principle that matters\".\nFELIX, February 13,1981 PageS\n\n"

The next U GM is the Hustings U GM on\nMarch 5.\nOverseas Students\nThe Finance and Executive Committees met on\nFriday to discuss amongst other things fees for\noverseas students, for the next session. After\nsome discussion it was agreed by the Committee\nmembers that fees for undergraduate and\nresearch courses would be the minimum, i.e. \u00a32,500 for Maths and \u00a33,600 for all others and for\nadvanced courses (MSc to us mere mortals) the\nfee will be \u00a34,000. This apparently is to test the\nmarket. I cannot quite see the point in charging\n\u00a3400 extra, but the Governors couldn't quite see\nthe point in charging \u00a3400 less.\nI then asked if some courses could be\nsubsidized for Third World students, the Rector\nasking in response if the Union would be\nprepared to forego part of its budget to pay for it.\nThe Rector did say that the fees are laid down\nby Government and in the present economic\nclimate it is impossible to charge less. This is what\nwe are up against (a Tory Government that is).\nOn Greek students, both myself and Bob\nBradley stress d the position of the first year\nGreeks in particular, but the Committee decided\nnot to refund any money, but to consider any\nGreek students who are in hardship in a favourable light. One point was made about giving\nmoney back to the sons of Greek shipowner s. PGs\nI mentioned the questionnaire at Board of Studies\nin particular the problem of supervisors and was\nmet by stoney silence. The Rector asked me to\nprepare a document to be included in the Board\nof Studies minutes and I will raise the matter in\ndepartments.\nNuclear Fuel Technology\nSeveral students and I met the Rector on Monday\nto discuss Nuclear Technology and after about\none hour of useful discussion we left to consider\nthe next move. This is likely to be at Board of\nStudies.\nBye for NOW. Stop\nSmoking\nA clinic will be held at the College Health\nService on Fridays at 12:30, commencing\nFebruary 20,1981.

The film, made by Peter Watkins for the BBC, depicts the effects of a nuclear attack on Britain\n\u2014 and has been banned from television since its\ncompletion in 1965. The reason originally given\nbeing that it was \"too horrifying for the medium of'\nbroadcasting''.\nKenneth Tynan of the Observer, one of the few\nwho saw it then, said: \"I suspect that it may be the\nmost important film ever made. Given wide\nenough dissemination, I believe it might change\nthe course of history\".\nLord Norman brook, Chairman of BBC Governors, had this to say: \"This film... is based\non careful research into official material. I have\nseen the film and can say that it has been\nproduced with considerable restraint. But the film\nis necessarily alarming, and the showing of the\nfilm on television might well have a significant\neffect on public attitudes towards the policy of\nnuclear deterrent. In these circumstances I doubt\nwhether the BBC ought alone to take the\nresponsibility of deciding whether this film should\nbe shown on television... It seems to me that the\nGovernment should have an opportunity of\nexpressing a view about this\".\nThe Government duly decided it would\n\"prefer\" the BBC not to screen it officially\nbecause of the possible effects on vulnerable and\nsensitive people. Private showings, however have\ncontinued to draw large audiences \u2014 while\ntechnical details may change the picture of\nindividual suffering in nuclear war remains the\nsame. Mary Whitehouse has said of the banning\nthat it \"was one of the most enlightened decisions\nmade in recent television history\". We cannot\nagree.
