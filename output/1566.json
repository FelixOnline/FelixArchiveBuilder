At a cost of\naround $3 billion and taking 13 years,\nfor the first time we had a sequence of\naround 99% of the human genome.\nOn January 14, Illumina, the\nmarket leader for genome sequencing\ntechnology, revealed their HiSeq\nX Ten Sequencing System, which\nthey claim will be able to sequence\na human genome for just $1000 and\nwith the potential to sequence 16\nhuman genomes in three days.\nJust five years ago, the same\ncompany was offering whole genome\nsequencing for around $50,000\nper genome, showing how far the\ntechnology has developed in this time.\nIn fact, for many applications the rate-limiting step is no longer sequencing\nthe genome but in analysis of the large\namount of data generated.\nUnfortunately, the figure of $1000\nper genome only applies if you buy\na set of at least ten sequencers at a\ncost of around $10 million. This is\noutside the reach of many academic\nlabs, although the Broad Institute in\nCambridge, Massachusetts is amongst\nthe first customers.\nThis development could also bring\ndown the cost to labs that outsource\ntheir sequencing, undercutting the\nprice offered by competing company\nComplete Genomics by around 80%.\nAnother sequencing company,\nOxford Nanopore (ONT), does not yet\nhave a sequencer on the market, but\ncaused a stir last year by announcing\nplans for the GridION, an affordable\ndesktop sequencer that would deliver\nthe $1000 genome.\nThey also described the possibility\nof MinION sequencers that could\nfit into USB sticks. Using nanopore\ntechnology, a fundamentally different\nsystem from those currently available\nmethods, these sequencers have been\nreleased on a trial basis but have error\nrates of around 1%, making them\nunsuitable for most applications.\nAs this is improved, however, it\nseems likely that ONT could become\na rival to Illumina, who are developing\ntheir own nanopore-based method\nafter selling their shares in ONT last\nNovember.\nIn 2012, David Cameron announced\nthe100kGenomeProject,anambitious\nproject to sequence the genomes\ntony piro, calamitiesofnature.com\nNASA, ESA, J. Lotz Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\nH\nave you ever wondered\nwhy we tend to\nremember some things\nmore than others? Our\nnervous system is a\nhighly organised, complex system of\nneurones (units that communicate\nvia electrical signals), their dendrites\n(highly branched outgrowths) and\nsupport cells called glia (involved in\nprocesses such as maintenance and\nprotection). It is estimated that the\nhuman brain contains around 86.1\nbillion neurones, with some capable\nof having up to 400,000 dendrites.\nIn the developing embryo,\nundifferentiated precursor cells\ndevelop to form the neurones and\nglia. What is fascinating about\nthese processes is what follows the\ndifferentiation phase: up to 50-70% of\nneurones can undergo programmed\nself-destruction \u2013 apoptosis. This\nconcept of neurones being remodelled\nand constantly forming new synaptic\nconnections is known as synaptic\nplasticity \u2013 it is speculated that this\noccurs to fine-tune the connectivity in\nthe nervous system.\nThis process is believed to slow\ndown immediately after birth (and\nthen on throughout life) and is\nsupposed to be crucially important\nfor memory development in infants.\nChildren use their memories to learn\nnew information; however, very few\nadults can recall events that occurred\nbefore the age of three. Sigmund Freud\ncoined the term \u201cchildhood amnesia\u201d\nto describe this observed loss of recall\nof events in the infant years.\nAn experiment run by a team of\npsychologists at the Emory University,\nled by Professor Patricia Bauer,\ndocumented early autobiographical\nmemory formation in children\n(starting at the age of three and then\nsuccessive years) to determine the age\nat which these events were forgotten.\nTheir findings, published in the\njournal Memory, show that children\nbetween ages of five and seven could\nrecall more than 60% of early-life\nevents, whereas children who were\neight to nine years old remembered\nless than 40% of early-life events.\nInterestingly, they also found that\nalthough children aged five to six could\nremember a greater percentage of\nearly-life events, their narratives were\nless complete. However, older children\n\u2013 despite remembering fewer events \u2013\nwere able to describe the events they\ndid remember in more detail. Several\npossible explanations have been put\nforward to explain this observation,\nsuch as improved language skills and\nreinforcing of synaptic connections\nwith each subsequent recollection of\nthese memories.\nThe analogy used by Professor\nBauer was that of pasta draining in\na colander: \u201cMemories are like orzo\n[rice-sized pasta]... as the water rushes\nout, so do many of the grains of orzo\u201d\nwhereas adults use a \u201cfine net instead\nof a colander\u201d to retain many of their\nmemories.\nAlthough we may be closer to\nknowing the changes that occur\nbetween early childhood and adult\nmemories, the precise timing of this\nchange is yet unknown. Professor\nBauer ended her interview by saying,\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to know more about when\nwe trade in our colanders for a net.\u201d\nDOI: 10.1080/09658211.2013.854806\nAgrandgenome:thenewcostofgenomesequencing\nof 100,000 individuals, many with\ngenetic diseases, by the end of 2017.\nA total of \u00a3100 million was pledged to\ndeliver this goal, meaning the falling\ncost of whole genome sequencing is\na step in the right direction for this\nproject. While Genomes England,\nthe company set up to bring the 100k\nGenome Project to fruition, is not on\nthe list of customers to have already\nordered a HiSeq X Ten, the promise\nof $1000 genomes at a fast rate seems\ntailor-made for them.\nThe decrease in sequencing cost\nis also promising for the field of\npersonalised medicine. The risk of\ndeveloping many diseases, such as\ncancer and diabetes, is to some extent\ndetermined by your genetics.\nAdditionally, some drugs only\nwork in patients with certain genetic\nvariants, while some variants are\nassociated with increased risk of side\neffects with some drugs, including\nstatins, a widely-used group of anti-cholesterol drugs.\nIn the future, your GP could use\nyour genome sequence to help decide\nwhich medications to use, as well as to\nhelp determine whether you are likely\nto be at risk of developing a genetic\ndisease.\nEnCor Biotechnology Inc.\nbusinesswire.com\nChris Yates\nScience Writer\nRat neurons stained with a green chicken antibody\n\n"

    "content": "11\nFRIDAY 31 JAN\nFelixScience\n@Scifelix\nSCIENCE\nDo you want brains with that?\nAnand Jagatia takes a look at prions, the bad behaving proteins\nmars.nasa.gov\nP\nrions (rhymes with\n\u201cneons\u201d) are really\ninteresting proteins.\nThey can also be\nvery dangerous. The\nname is a derivative of the words\n\u201cPROtein\u201d and \u201cINfectious\u201d, and\nas the etymology suggests, they\ncause a group of infectious illnesses,\ncalled \u201ctransmissible spongiform\nencephalopathies\u201d (TSEs).\nEncephalopathies are diseases of the\nbrain, and spongiform comes from\nthe fact that over time, tiny holes\nappear throughout the cortex of the\nvictim \u2013 just like you\u2019d see in a sponge.\nPrion diseases are degenerative\nand always fatal. Probably the most\nfamous example is the bovine variant,\nBSE, or \u201cmad cow disease\u201d. The UK\nepidemic of the disease, which began\nin 1986 and led to a ten year ban on\nthe selling of British beef, was the\nresult of feeding cattle the mashed\nremains of other slaughtered animals\n(including bones, brains and spinal\ncords). The feeding practices led to\nthe spread of prions from infected\nto healthy animals and accelerated\ntransmission of the disease.\nHuman forms of TSE come in\nseveral varieties. In rare cases,\nmutations of the gene for prion\nprotein may cause disease, but the\nmajority of the time it is exposure to\ninfectious prions is to blame. \u201cKuru\u201d,\na disease endemic to tribal areas of\nPapua New Guinea, is probably the\ncondition with the most gruesome\nhistory \u2013 it is believed that the spread\nof the disease among the Fore tribe\nwas due to the cannabilistic funeral\nrights practised by its members. The\nincidence of infection was found to be\nmuch higher in women and children,\nwho were generally given the less\ndesirable body parts to eat, including\nthe brain, where most of the prion\nmatter is concentrated.\nMisfolded prions are also extremely\nstable and can\u2019t be destroyed by heat,\nso cooking meat doesn\u2019t prevent\ninfection. Despite claims of the UK\ngovernment during the BSE crisis\nthat infected beef was completely safe\nto eat, there have been 175 reported\ncases of the human form of the\ndisease in the UK since the ban. Most\nof these cases are thought to be linked\nto consumption of beef infected with\nprions.\nScientifically, the puzzling thing\naboutprionsisthewaytheyreplicate.\nNot all prions are infectious \u2013 the\nnormal kind is found in many cells\nthroughout the body, especially the\ncell membranes of neurons. But\nprions can also exist in a misfolded\nstate, and this is the kind that leads\nto disease.\nAccording to the popular scientific\nview, infectious prions can act as a\nscaffold for normal prions to misfold\nthemselves, and this chain reaction\ncauses the infection to spread\nthroughout the brain.\nOnce misfolded prions are formed,\nthey clump together in big chains\ncalled amyloid fibres, which are toxic\nto cells and cause them to die. The\nprionhypothesisisstillcontroversial,\nbecause all other infectious agents,\n(like viruses) need RNA or DNA\nto replicate themselves, but it does\nseem that prions can be infectious\nwithout containing any genetic\nmaterial.\nTodate,therehasbeenlittleheadway\nin explaining how all this might\nhappen. Recently though, scientists\nfrom the Prion Biology Laboratory in\nItaly have made promising progress.\nLast week, the group published a\npaper in the Journal of the American\nChemical Society, outlining how\nthey used small proteins, called\nnanobodies, to stabilise misfolded\nprions and then used X-rays to explore\ntheir structure.\nFor the first time, their research\nsheds some light onto the early stages\nin the mechanism of prion misfolding,\nwhich might be the first steps to\nunderstanding how these peculiar\nproteins are so deadly.\nThese prions may look pretty, but they can be deadly too\nAncient traces of water found on Mars\nJames Bezer\nScience Writer\nF\nor a vehicle designed to\nlast just 7 earth weeks,\nOpportunity has done\nremarkably well. Ten years\nto the day since the rover\nfirst landed on the surface of Mars,\nits new analysis of some of the\noldest rocks ever found there show\nenvironments potentially suitable for\nlife were around on the planet much\nearlier than we previously thought.\nThe samples, estimated at over\n4 billion years old, contained clay\nminerals, rich in iron and aluminium,\nthat suggest the red planet may have\nbeen much warmer and wetter in the\nvery distant past.\nAccording to the mission\u2019s Deputy\nPrincipal Investigator Ray Arvidson:\n\u201cthese rocks are older than any we\nexamined earlier in the mission,\nand they reveal more favourable\nconditions for microbial life than\nany evidence previously examined by\nOpportunity.\u201d\nSince it landed in a crater on the\nMeridiani plains on January 25 2004,\nOpportunity has sent 170,000 images\nback to earth, alongside data from its\ntwo spectrometers, which can analyse\nthe chemical composition of soil\nand air samples. Its many significant\ndiscoveries include the first meteorite\never seen on another planet, and soil\nlayers similar to structures on Earth\nthat appear to have been caused by\nthe movement of wind and water in\nthe distant past. It has also performed\na detailed analysis of the Martian\natmosphere through tracing of argon\ngas.\nOpportunity has travelled 25 miles\nfrom its original landing site to the\nEndeavour crater, where its most\nrecent results have come from. Its\npath has been guided by data from\nthe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a\nNASA satellite that can take highly\ndetailed photographs of the planet\u2019s\nsurface.\nOpportunity is one of a number\nof craft currently analysing the\nenvironment on Mars. Its larger\ncousin Curiosity, which landed in\nGale crater in July 2012, has already\nmade significant discoveries. In\nDecember last year, it encountered\nevidence of a huge lake that existed\naround 3.5 billion years ago. Much\nlike Opportunity\u2019s recent discovery,\nthe water had a neutral pH, and\ncontained key elements vital for life\non Earth, such as carbon, nitrogen and\nphosphorus, potentially making it an\nideal place for microbes to live. The\ndiscovery prompted John Grotzinger,\nproject scientist for Curiosity, to\ndescribe parts of Mars as \u201cextremely\nEarthlike\u201d.\nSofarthough,whilemanypotentially\nhabitable environments have been\nfound on the planet, no complex\norganic molecules \u2013 the building\nblocks of life on earth \u2013 have yet been\ndetected. Such a discovery could\nprovide the first direct suggestion that\nsome forms of life may have existed\nthere in the past: one of the key aims\nof Mars exploration.\nNobody knows how much longer\nOpportunity has left until its systems\nbegin to stop working. Its twin, Spirit,\nwhich landed around the same time,\nstoppedsendingbackinformationfour\nyears ago. Intense dust storms and\nhuge temperature fluctuations make\nMars an inhospitable location for any\npiece of technology. Many electrical\ncomponents have stopped working,\nand one of its wheels is broken. But\ndespite this, Opportunity\u2019s condition\nhas deteriorated relatively little\nrecently, and it is fully expected to\nkeep going for another few years yet.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more good stuff ahead,\u201d said\nSteve Squyres, Opportunity\u2019s principal\ninvestigator. \u201cWe\u2019re examining a rock\nright in front of the rover that\u2019s unlike\nanything we\u2019ve seen before. Mars\nkeeps surprising us, just like the very\nfirst week of the mission.\u201d\nThe Mars Opportunity rover has surpassed all expectations\n\n"

    "content": "15\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 31 JAN\nCOMMENT\nA\nt the time of writing,\nthe Guardian has just\nrun an online story\nabout Obama. It\nseems he is ready to\nbypass congress when it comes to his\n2014 agenda. Dan Pfeifer, Obama\u2019s\nsenior advisor for strategy appears\nparticularly \u2018American\u2019 in the most\npejorative European sense of the\nterm: \u2018We need to show the American\npeople we can get something done\u2026\nthe President is not going to tell the\nAmerican people he will wait for\nCongress.\u2019\nSuitably gung-ho for a president\nwho saw a number of high profile\ngun crimes in 2013 and refused to\nuse the word gun, even in his \u2018angry\u2019\nand \u2018heartfelt\u2019 speech condemning\nthese err, unspeakable, crimes. But\nthen something struck me about this\nnew gung-ho attitude\u2026 Where was\nit for all the various issues Obama\nspoke of that made us-on-the-left\nso delighted with the fashionable\nyoung black presidential candidate\nfive years ago? Where was this single\nminded determination when it came\nto Guantanamo? Or the healthcare\nreforms? Or the economy? I thought\nthe whole problem was that Obama\nwas essentially a good guy but\nheld up by all those blood-sucking\nRepublicans? Didn\u2019t they shut down\nthe government last October? If\nObama had the powers of dictator-elect, why for heaven\u2019s sake (and this is\ncoming from an atheist), didn\u2019t he use\nthem then?\nClearly his plans for 2014 were\nbigger and better than such minor\nissues as stopping (direct) US torture\nor somehow making the efficient\nprivate-sector health service in the\nUS better than Cuba\u2019s. Incidentally in\n2011, annual government expenditure\non healthcare amounted to over 17%\nof GDP in the US \u2013 something like\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nSorry for droning on...\n40 times total Cuban GDP, strangled\nas it has been for half a century by an\neconomic embargo. What are these\nplans? We will find out in Obama\u2019s\nstate of the union address on Tuesday\n(time of writing is Sunday 26th Jan)\nand needless to say I am breathless in\nanticipation. Barack the builder, can\nwe fix it? Yes, we can!\nYet bizarrely enough, there seems\nto be a whole host of other things that\nObama has done without the express\napproval of congress. No doubt many\nin senate would approve of the two\nAmerican-backed coups in Honduras\nand Paraguay since Obama started\noffice, and perhaps they even largely\nknew about it, but I fail to recall\nexpress approval of any such actions\nreported in the press. Similarly, the\nassassination of Osama bin Laden\nwithout trial was not something\ntrumpeted to the world until after the\nfact. Who in Senate knew about the\nnumerous murders in Pakistan and\nYemen in the deliberate campaign\nof war waged against farmers and\nchildren and other threats to \u2018national\nsecurity\u2019. Well everyone, this civilised\npractice of modern warfare was\napproved in the House. But who\ngets to judge exactly who gets, um,\ndroned? Is there a vote every time a\npotential drone candidate is found?\nNo; Obama has a \u2018constitutional\u2019 right\nto act as judge, jury and executioner.\nFor surely, Obama must be acting\nconstitutionally? We may, err,\ndisapprove of some of the more\nabstract and less appetising moral or\nethical consequences of drone attacks,\nsuch as: is it really fair for soldiers to\nbe able to kill targets from thousands\nof miles away without any risks to\nthemselves? Is it surprising when\nthose soldiers, from thousands of\nmiles away, end up killing the \u2018wrong\u2019\npeople? But, I suppose, as I have\nargued before, ethical considerations\nare a luxury only affordable to the\ncomfortable, and we shouldn\u2019t let such\nabstract scruples worry us when our\nvery way of life is at risk from, um,\nIslamo-fascist fundamentalist evil\nJew-demon monster people. Have you\nnot seen Four Lions?\nBecause, to get back to the point,\nObama, as a trained constitutional\nlawyer and recipient of the Nobel\nPeace Prize must surely be innocent\nof any crime? Would an American\nPresident, the most powerful\nindividual in the world, knowingly\ncommit a crime? Nixon knows better:\nit is simply \u2018impossible\u2019 to commit a\ncrime as American President because\nthat\u2019s the way democracy works. You\nvoted for me so shut-up and quit\nwhining. For four years I, as American\nPresident, have a God given right to\nassassinate, torture, extraordinarily\nrender, and misabuse the English\nlanguage. Since Clinton, I can even\nchange the meaning of sex.\nYou see the US, by virtue of being the\nUS, is allowed to kill people in other\ncountries without trial. Especially if\nthey are not white, though the good\nmen and women (wouldn\u2019t want\nto be sexist \u2013 American women\nhave the right to indiscriminately\nkill Arabs too!) of the CIA can get\nover their scruples if it is a matter\nof \u2018national security\u2019. These matters\ntranscend such petty things such as\nconstitutional rights, as was clearly\nshown in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki,\nradical Islamist American-Yemeni\nImam suspected of terrorism \u2013 though\nactual evidence directly linking him to\na terrorist attack is still forthcoming.\nRest assured, he was guilty of thought\ncrimes \u2013 he approved of suicide\nbombing \u2013 so he was \u2018really\u2019 a terrorist,\neven if he wasn\u2019t really a terrorist.\nI thus presume that Abdulrahman\nAl-Awlaki, al-Awlaki\u2019s son killed in a\ndrone attack two weeks later at the age\nof sixteen while eating in a restaurant\nwith his cousin and friends, was guilty\nof blood crimes. That is guilty by\nvirtue of being the son of his father.\nThe people criminal justice system\nwill be glad to have found such a\nsure-fire way of making their jobs that\nmuch easier. And don\u2019t worry, even if\nthere was no official backing from the\nSenate, the Senate\u2019s majority leader\nassured Candy Crowley on CNN that\nsixteen year old Abdulrahman got\nwhat he deserved.\nBefore I conclude, there are two\nthings I would like to clarify. Firstly, I\nwrote about Abdulrahman and Anwar\nal-Awlaki because Jeremy Scahill\nhas told their story and could do so\nbecause they were American citizens.\nMany of the less fortunate, those\nborn in Pakistan or Yemen, are killed\nwithout so much as the tribute of an\nangry journalist, and certainly lack\nthe exposure of the English language\npress. While the news can pick up on\nthe tragedies that paint a nice picture\nabout us (the fifteen year old Malala\nshot by regressive misogynist Islamist\nfundamentalists in Pakistan and saved\nin Britain) we are less likely to tell the\nstories that see us as the guilty party.\nSecondly, would things be better if the\nAmerican Senate voted on each drone\nattack approved? Or more unlikely, if\nthe people of America made the same\ndecision? Do I argue that, while I may\nnot approve of certain actions made\nby the US government they damn well\nought to be democratically approved,\nconstitutional and legal? No I don\u2019t. I\ncan\u2019t imagine anything more stupid.\nAlas, with the ineluctable passage\nof time we have lost the right to\ntarget whomever to those brash\nyoung Americans. May they bear it\nresponsibly.\n\u201cWhere was it for all the various\nissues Obama spoke of that made\nus-on-the-left so delighted with the\nfashionable young black presidential\ncandidate five years ago? Where was\nthis single minded determination when it\ncame to Guantanamo? Or the healthcare\nreforms? Or the economy?\n\u201d\n\u201cDo I argue that, while I may not\napprove of certain actions made by the US\ngovernment they damn well ought to be\ndemocratically approved, constitutional\nand legal? No I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t imagine\nanything more stupid.\n\u201d\ndronewars.net\n\n"

So definitely a\nplace to go for a fun weekend while\nenjoying some guilt-free yummy food!\nwww.thealbany.org.uk\nTasted some amazing food this week?\nShare it with us:\n#FelixFood on Instagram\nK\nung Hei Fat Choi! The\nyear of the horse has once\nagain arrived and if you\nfeel like having something\nfestive, but find Chopstix\nslightly too greasy, here\u2019s a healthy\nrecipe for you!\nIf people tell you Chinese food is\nhard to cook, they are lying to you.\nThere is an Chinese idiom \u201cPeople\nrank food heavenly high\u201d, so the\ncuisine has developed itself to be as\naccessible as possible, while keeping\nthe good taste.\nFestive Treat\nA good example is dumplings - or\njiaozi. They came from the Ming\nDynasty, when its name and looks\nresembled the money used at the time,\nso serving them is believed to bring\nprosperity - especially at midnight on\nChinese New Year\u2019s Eve. And since\nthen, it has become one of the most\npopular foods of the nation, with\nvariations served at breakfast, lunch\nand dinner - the same can\u2019t be said for\nfish and chips!\nIngredients:\n- 500g of minced pork\n- 100g of prawns\n- 4 dried shiitake mushrooms,\nreconstituted with some hot water\n- 2 cloves of garlic\n- 2 spring onions\n- 1 thumb sized chunk ginger\n- 1 tablespoon of soy sauce\n- Some salt, pepper and sesame oil\n- Dumpling/Wanton skin (available\nin Asian supermarkets)\n1. Finely chop the garlic, ginger, spring\nonions, mushrooms and prawns. Add\nthem to a big bowl with the mince\npork, a bit of soaking liquid from\nthe mushrooms, soy sauce, salt and\npepper. Mix it up with your hand.\n2. Put a tablespoon of filling onto the\ncentre of the skin, then put a little bit\nof water around the edges and squeeze\nit into the \u201cdumpling shape\u201d. Here is\nwhere your creativity can kick in, any\nform is fine as long as it is sealed.\n3. Put it in boiling water for around\n5-10 minutes, or until they start to\nfloat. Usually served with noodles,\nbut it\u2019s up to you!\nThe brilliance of dumplings is the\nflexibility it provides. You can\nessentially put any filling - chicken,\nbeef, mixed vegetables - as long as\nit is sealed properly (don\u2019t overfill!)\nYou can also steam and pan fry\nthese dumplings to give it a different\ntexture and flavour. To pan fry them,\nput a tablespoon of oil and once\nhot, fry the dumplings for around\n3 minutes, until the base is golden.\nAdd boiling water just around\nhalf way up, cover and let it steam\naway. You can serve it with different\ndipping sauces - my favourites\nare sweet chilli sauce or soy sauce\nand worcestershire sauce mixed\ntogether!\nThe recipe above does make\nquite a big batch but dumplings\nare freezer-friendly (freeze raw.) So\nmake them over the weekend, then\njust take a few out when you want\nthem. No thawing needed - just cook\nfrom frozen for a little longer.\nOkay, apart from your local Chinese takeaway and Chinatown...\nBefore we begin, a disclaimer: Satsumas, clementines, tangerines - basically\nany easy-peel citrus orange with easy to separate segments you can think\nof falls under the category of mandarin oranges. Think of it this way - all\nclementines are mandarin oranges, but not all mandarin oranges are\nclementines. (Mandarins are usually bigger in Asia...but these will do.)\nIf you must/insist there\u2019s no diff, feel free to substitute with your standard non-easy-peel (Navel) oranges. You may feel the pernickety wrath of some Asians\nin the process (myself possibly included)...but hey, all citrus deserves some\nlove! Also, recycle Gu dessert pots for ramekins. You\u2019re welcome.\n3 large eggs\n5 large egg yolks\n200g light brown sugar\n600ml double cream\nzest and flesh segments from 6 mandarins (or 2-3 normal oranges)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nPreheat oven to 175C. Mix (do not whip) the egg yolks, eggs, mandarin juice,\nand 110g of brown sugar (remainder is for topping!) until fully combined.\nOver medium heat, warm cream and mandarin zest in saucepan to scalding\npoint - stir occasionally. Gradually pour the egg mixture into cream, stirring\nconstantly (too quickly and you get scrambled egg.) Add salt and vanilla.\nStrain custard using a fine mesh strainer into a jug (it will still be liquidy.)\nPlace a tea towel on the bottom of a deep roasting tin, then arrange ramekins\non top and put 2-3 mandarin segments in ramekins. Pour hot water from a\nkettle until it reaches halfway up the ramekins, then divvy up your custard mix\nbetween the ramekins until they are about 3/4 full.\nBake custards for about 25 mins, or until they are set with a slight wobble\nin centre when shaken. (Or get geeky and make sure your food probe reads)\nRemove from the water bath and allow to cool, then refrigerate until they\nthoroughly chilled. Can be made ahead 4-5 days in advance, just keep them\nwell-covered to stop other fridge smells seeping in!\nFor topping: Preheat oven to 150C. Line a baking tray with parchment, spread\nout remaining sugar into an even, thin layer. Put in oven until it starts to dry\nout (around 3-5 min.). Remove, allow to cool, then crunch with a rolling pin\nto break up into granules again. Reserve until serving time.\nTo serve: Sprinkle an even layer of the dried sugar on the custards. Torch with\nquick swirling motions, or bung under a hot grill until bubbly. Let cool (very\nbriefly) to allow topping to solidify (gives you that satisfying crack when hit\nwith your spoon.) Top with mandarin segments - dig in rightaway!\nthewi.org\n\n"

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 31 JAN\nFEATURES\nEditor: Shiladitya\nGhosh\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nInterview with Matthew, Lord\nCarrington of Fulham.\n8th January 2014\nAlexander Morton: Thank you very\nmuch for your time this afternoon\nMatthew. If I recall correctly, in\n1967 you were the Chairman of\nthe Imperial College Conservative\nSociety?\nMatthew Carrington: That\u2019s right,\n1967-1968, I don\u2019t think I did it in my\nfinal year which was 1968 - 1969, so yes\nit would have been that. It was quite\nan active society at that time, although\nI can\u2019t for the life of me remember\nhow many members we had. We had\na lot more signed up members than\nwere active members.\nAM: So why did you get involved in\npolitics as a student?\nMC: Well you know I\u2019m one of these\nrather sad individuals who has always\nbeen involved in politics. I was\ninvolved in politics at school, and I\nwas very political, and my late mother\nused to maintain when she was talking\nto people that I was passionate about\npolitics at the age of eleven, but I don\u2019t\nquite remember it being that early.\nHowever, it was certainly a natural\nprogression going from school to\nuniversity to getting involved with\nthe Conservative politics. Frankly the\npassionate has never left me, so I\u2019ve\nalways been involved in Conservative\npolitics.\nAM: How do you feel Conservative\npolitics has changed from when you\nwere a student to where you are now\nin the House of Lords?\nMC: When I was a student, politics\ngenerally was much more patrician,\nthe Conservative party infinitely more\npatrician. We used to have things\nlike, what\u2019s now CCHQ, but in those\ndays was Central Office, send around\nexcellent ladies (and they were ladies,\nthe ones we had) and do public\nspeaking courses for students and\nthings like that, which you know, were\nreally quite useful. However, the Party\ndoesn\u2019t do things like that anymore\nand it is very different now. In fact,\nthey don\u2019t provide much support to\nanything these days. Back then it was\nthe Party of Ted Heath, obviously,\nhaving just been the Party of Sir Alec\nDouglas-Home. I remember sitting\nin Beit, in the Union Building, on the\nfirst floor, where they had a television\nset, which was very unusual in the\nbuilding or in any part of Imperial at\nthat time, and watching Harold Wilson\nmaking his television broadcast about\nthe Pound in your pocket not being\ndevalued. So that dates me a bit! [He\nlaughs]\nAM: I was thinking that one of the\nthings that has changed is that we\nhaven\u2019t lived through the era where\nsocialism was really Socialism \u2026\nMC: \u2026 and we did live through it!\nAnd we lived through a time, dare\nI say it, the Conservative Party was\nprepared to go along with a lot of\nthe socialist assumptions about the\nway the economy should be run and\nthat of course changed with Margaret\nThatcher. And it desperately needed\nto change. I graduated in 1969 and\nfought my first election in 1979. I\nfought Fulham in 1987, having fought\nit a by-election in \u201986 after Martin\nStevens died, and then lost the by-election for a lot of very good reasons.\nGovernments lose by-elections and\nthat was no exception. Various crises\ncome up during the election, but we\ndidn\u2019t lose it that badly and I won\nit back convincingly during \u201987 and\nstayed on and won it in 1992 with\nincreased majority and sadly went\ndown the great crash of 1997 with\nTony Blair\u2019s victory.\nAM: Entering the Commons during\nthe latter part of Lady Thatcher\u2019s\ntime in office, could you tell us what\nshe was like?\nMC:Shewasanamaz\u2026anastonishing\nlady as everyone knows, but she had\nno interpersonal skills at all. It\u2019s one of\nthese sad things about people who are\nvery, very good and very driven and\nknow exactly what they are trying to\ndo and can force their views through\na great deal of opposition \u2026. but she\nwas extremely difficult in dealing\nwith groups and she had none of the\nnatural personal charm which you\nmight assume that a great political\nleader would have. For instance, just\nto give you a silly little story which is\nso silly, but is fairly typical of her. She\nwould be in a receiving line of MP\u2019s,\nso she knew us all, and we\u2019d be going\nup and shaking her by the hand for a\nreception at 10 Downing Street. And\nwhat her way of operating in that\nwas to grab you by the hand, pull\nyou straight through past her by her\nhand, while looking at the next person\ncoming up. Laughs. So no eye contact,\nabsolutely no personal tosh at all, and\nshe vaguely knew who you were, but\ndid she even do that really \u2026\nAM: You were just lobby-fodder?\nMC: We were just something she had\nto get through, and she got through it\nin an efficient way and who is to say\ngetting through these things in an\nefficient way isn\u2019t the right way to do it\nif you are a very busy lady? It did mean\nthough that some of my colleagues,\nnot me as it happens as I thought\nvery highly of her, did swallow once\nor twice before proclaiming that she\nwas a wonderful leader. Which is of\ncourse one of the reasons why she had\nthe problems she did in 1990 when the\nleadership contest came up.\nAM: What was it like being in the\nParty during the leadership crisis?\nMC: It was frenetic! There were\ncabals of people getting together and\ndiscussing what they were going to do\nand how they were going to do it and\nall sorts of rumours about who was\ngoing to vote for Mrs Thatcher and\nwho was going to vote the \u2026 \u201cOther\nCandidate\u201d [Michael Heseltine]\u2026 It\nwas one of those, if you like politics,\none of those, dare I say, exciting times.\nIn retrospect it was a beastly time, but\nat the time it was all very exciting.\nAM: After Mrs Thatcher, you had\nthe surprise of John Major winning\nthe 1992 election \u2026\nMC: It wasn\u2019t a surprise, it was a\nsurprise on the opinion polls. Having\nsaid that though, my old constituency\n[Fulham] had been very marginal.\nIt was less marginal after the 1992\nelection because I got over 50% of\nthe vote, but we always had fought it\nand canvassed it very closely, and so\nwe had a very detailed record of what\npeople\u2019s opinions were on the doorstep\nfrom the general election in 1987, the\nby-election in 1986, from the election\nin 1983, and indeed the election in\n1979. As such, we could match the\npresent canvass returns against the\npast canvass returns. And we did. We\nwould do this on a daily basis and then\non polling day we would do it on an\nhourly basis as people were turning\nout. Our results, consistently, all the\nway through the 1992 election were\nbetter than they had been in 1987 and\n1983, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise to us at\nall as our canvass returns were much\nbetter [than the general media polls].\nSo when we increased the majority\nand got a very good result, we were\nnot the least bit surprised.\nJohn Major is very underrated. In fact,\npart of his great problem was that\nas Prime Minister, and it\u2019s the same\nas Ken Clarke as Chancellor of the\nExchequer in the latter part of John\nMajor\u2019s Government, is that they did\na fabulous job, almost too good a job\nfor the politics as they were very, very\ngood at running the country, but they\nweren\u2019t very good at making people\nrealise they were doing a good job of\nrunning the country and then saying\nto people, \u201cnow we have the economy\nstraight, this is our vision for what we\nare now going to do with it\u201d. As such\npeople felt, I think, in 1997 that they\nwanted someone a bit more exciting\nthan John Major on television and\nthey thought the economy was in\ngood shape and so they thought that\nsomeone could come and spend some\nmoney. Which they couldn\u2019t of course\n\u2026 in hindsight it was a disaster. \u2026 One\nof the strong messages coming out of\nthe Treasury is that the economy is\nimproving, and actually is improving\nquite rapidly, but isn\u2019t improving to\nthe extent that we can ever relax about\nit. Certainly not for the next four to\nfive years, which takes us well through\nthe next election.\nAM: What would you say were the\nmain failings of the Conservative\nParty, and why it has not been\nable to win a majority at a General\nElection for 17 years?\nMC: It\u2019s been a puzzle to a lot of us. I\nthink it comes down to looking back\non the 13 years we were practically\nout of power, and I think we were seen\nas a Party which didn\u2019t do what the\nConservative Party always been very\ngood at \u2013 being very conservative on\nthe economy, being very rigorous on\nthe economy, but socially being really\nquite liberal. We lost that feel. People\nfelt we were telling them how to run\ntheir lives, rather than moving with\nthe flow of the way people wanted to\nlive their own lives and encouraging\nthem to be able to do what they\nwanted to do, rather than doing what\nwe thought what they should do. I\nthink we lost a bit of that, and then\nof course a party which can\u2019t agree\namongst itself on things like Europe,\nand tears itself apart, which we did in\nthe Maastricht debate and continued\nthrough practically to the present\nday, faces a real uphill struggle to\nconvince people that we are a unified\nforce which could change things. I\nthink we are much better at it now, I\nthink that David Cameron has done\na phenomenal job in that, in what are\nnightmare circumstances of having\nthe Liberals in Coalition.\nAM: On the subject of the Lords how\ncan you sell the idea of an unelected,\nundemocratic chamber?\nMC: I think there are a lot of\nmythologies about the Lords these\ndays. People who are used to having a\nSenate with a bicameral system have\nto understand that we don\u2019t have a\nbicameral system. What we have is\none chamber, which is the Commons,\nwhich is not only paramount, but is\nthe only real elected chamber, which\nhas the ability to make laws. The\nLords is an advisory chamber, and it\nis really no more than that. We don\u2019t\nreally even have a delaying power\nanymore. We can vote against things,\nthey get sent back to the Commons,\nthe Commons overturns our vote\nand sends it straight back to us. What\nwe are however, being an advisory\nchamber, is full of people who are\nhugely experienced in what they do.\nWe have High Court Judges, we have\nvery senior surgeons, we have very\nsenior academics, we have very senior\npeople from industry here \u2013 the sort\nof people who would not get elected\nto any chamber in the world and many\nwould certainly not stand for election\nand never put up with it. They come\nhere and put in a lot of time. They\nspend time with their colleagues\ndebating things in the Chamber, but\nalso more informal places around the\nLords. So \u2013 hugely influential.\nFor example, I was in a debate a few\ndays ago where we were discussing\na rather obscure part of Children\u2019s\nlegislation, where we had six very\nsenior judges stand up one after the\nother, discussing how this clause in\nthe bill would actually work in practice\nin the courts. You wouldn\u2019t get that\nanywhere else and so it does have an\nadvantage. It gives the Government\nthe ability to be able to tap into a\ndepth of experience which they would\nfind very difficult to marshal, and\nthey also have to take account of such\nexperience. It also means that there\nis a debate, there is a structure, and\nthere are 800 members of the House\nof Lords, and it means while in a\nCommittee you would have maybe 20\npeople at most, here you can have very\nsenior judges, you can have very junior\nbarristers, and you can have solicitors\nstanding up on the same thing in a\nstructured environment, having to\nmake their points, and having to argue\nit, and having to stand it up against\nother people\u2019s criticisms in public,\non the record. So it has advantages.\nIt is a very peculiar system, I think\neveryone would recognise that, but\nthe way it has evolved, it probably has\nsome strengths as well as clearly some\nweaknesses.\nAM: When you were a student at\nImperial College your tuition costs\nwere provided for by the State.\nWhat are your views on tuition fees?\nMC: I got a grant even! I got a\nmaintenance/living grant, the sort of\nthing which is unheard of these days.\nI think it is very sad. I would like not\nto have student tuition fees, but on the\nInterview with Lord Carrington of Fulham\nThe alumnus discusses the Conservative Party, tuition fees and student housing.\nLord Carrington\nDodOnline.com\n\n"

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 31 JAN\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Brothers Grim\nOut of the Furnace\nDirector: Scott Cooper\nWriters: Bret Ingelsby, Scott Cooper\nStarring: Christian Bale, Casey\nAffleck, Zoe Saldana, Woody\nHarrelson, Willem Dafoe, Forest\nWhitaker, Sam Shepard\nRuntime: 116 minutes\nCertification: 15\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nShocked to see how Christian Bale\nwas a \u2018fatman\u2019 in American Hustle?\nThe clearly dedicated actor is back\nto a healthier looking shape in Scott\nCooper\u2019s highly depressing thriller\nthat highlights that not all of America\nis a land of opportunity. No protagonist here can catch a break in this\ngrim, bleak look at what it\u2019s like when\nmoney is tight and jobs are scarce.\nRussell Baze (Bale) is managing to\nmake ends meet with his blue-col-lar factory job in Rust Belt, a part of\nAmerica that doesn\u2019t appear in the\nusual flashy, glamorous depiction.\nWith his sick, dying father to look\nafter from home (a sure dig at the\never-so-criticised American healthcare system, or the lack thereof), his\ndream for a better life seems to be\nslipping away. His younger brother\nRodney (Casey Affleck) is a soldier\nabout to be deployed to fight for his\ncountry (again, something that hints\nat the government\u2019s failure to take\ncare of its citizens). The only positive\naspect here is his girlfriend Lena (Zoe\nSaldana), who is eager to start a family with him, although he\u2019s hesitant for\nobvious reasons.\nThe set-up alone is dark and depressing enough. And it truly is a shock to\nsee such desperate individuals stuck in\na perpetual cycle of hardship. But then\nwhat happens? Something to make it\nall worse for everyone involved. A fatal DUI lands Russell in jail, and whilst\nserving his time, Lena has moved on\nwith Sheriff Wesley Barnes (Forest\nWhitaker), his father passes away, and\nRodney, returned from war, is suffering from post traumatic stress disor-der, not quite settling into civilian life,\nparticipating in illegal underground\nstreet fights and getting mixed up\nwith some very unpleasant characters\nwho don\u2019t take kindly to unpaid debts.\nDirector Scott Cooper is nowhere\nnear done yet. For the film\u2019s major\nsource of conflict, something that\nkicks our protagonist into gear is\nthe mysterious disappearance of his\nbrother. The brutal fist-fights Rodney\nhas gotten himself mixed up in are\nrun by Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), who is a nasty piece of work\nplayed so disturbingly brilliantly by\nHarrelson. There is most certainly a\nreal sense of danger whenever this\nunpredictable, trigger-happy villain\nappears, and that he\u2019s lurking around\nthe tightly-knit community of the\nRamapo mountains which virtually\nshields him from the law, is an even\nmore troubling prospect.\nHis father and girlfriend gone, and\nnow his brother missing, Russell ignores the advice of Sheriff Wesley to\nstay away and let law enforcement do\ntheir job. Teamed up with his uncle\nGerald Baze (Sam Shepard), Russell is\nout for answers and possibly for blood,\ngiven the uncertainty surrounding\nRodney\u2019s circumstances.\nThe glacial pace at which it moves\nworks to the film\u2019s advantage in its\nbuild-up, setting the general scenery,\nbut when it comes to actually getting\non with the important crime-solving,\nthrilling part, Russell starts taking\ncharge, gets his hunting rifle out, and\nstarts to do some vigilante crime-fighting of his own. Despite Bale\u2019s\ntypically strong, convincing lead per-formance, there is too much back and\nforth meandering of the narrative, and\ntoo much relies on contrived plot developments to move forward.\nPlus there are far too many wasted\ncharacters and actors to mention. Zoe\nSaldana\u2019s role is completely thankless\nand somewhat unnecessary, given\nhow quickly she\u2019s written off, it\u2019s confusing to see why Forest Whitaker was\ncast in a role that doesn\u2019t end up being\nat all crucial, the same goes for Willem\nDafoe and Sam Shepard.\nOut of the Furnace finds its best\nscenes when it pairs up the siblings.\nAffleck is outstanding in the wound-ed, traumatised role, and with Bale,\nthe two embody the difficulties and\nhardship of an everyday working man\nand their relationship provides some\nheart-breaking insight into how it\u2019s\nnot a wonderful life they lead.\nThe latest entry in the Jack Ryan franchise (a character who shares with\nJames Bond and The Doctor the habit\nof being played by multiple different\nactors with varying degrees of respect\nfor previous iterations) punches the\nbig red \u2018reboot\u2019 button \u2013 for the second\ntime, with The Sum of All Fears taking the same road over a decade ago,\nonly this time it doesn\u2019t even bother to\nuse one of Tom Clancy\u2019s many novels\nas inspiration. Nope, for the second\nreboot in a row (which should really\nbe telling Hollywood something, but\nwhatever \u2013 money talks, and The Sum\nof All Fears made a lot of it), we\u2019re\ntreated to a brand spanking new, original story. Oh, how I wish they\u2019d used\none of the books.\nThere\u2019s little point in beating around\nthe bush, and Shadow Recruit certainly doesn\u2019t, so here goes: the story\nhere is terrible. There are almost no\nredeeming features. It\u2019s dull, it\u2019s un-inspired, it\u2019s so patently predictable\nand by-the-numbers it\u2019s just (pain-fully) funny. The script features some\nof the most painfully on-the-nose dialogue since pretty much forever. The\nJack Ryan: Shadow\nRecruit\nDirector: Kenneth Branagh\nWriters: Adam Cozad, David Koepp,\nTom Clancy (characters)\nStarring: Chris Pine, Keira Knightley,\nKevin Costner, Kenneth Branagh\nRuntime: 105 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nJack Steadman\nTreasured Writer\nopening line, the opening line, I tell\nyou, comes from a student who says,\nquite simply: \u201cYou\u2019re American, aren\u2019t\nyou? I\u2019m sorry, mate.\u201d HE\u2019S TALKING\nABOUT 9/11. I MEAN SERIOUSLY,\nCOME ON. WHO LET THAT ONE\nTHROUGH? It\u2019s certainly no \u201cAs far\nback as I could remember, I always\nwanted to be a gangster\u201d, is it? No,\nit is not. But I digress, and I digress\nthoroughly and in block capitals.\nThe script\u2019s terrible, let\u2019s just leave it\nthere. Or not \u2013 one last jab. It tries\nso hard to be cool, to be the kind of\nbreezy, effortlessly suave film that it\nprobably should be, but the one liners\nare forced and the characterisation is\nthinner than a slice of Sainsbury\u2019s basics processed ham (for those of you\nfortunate enough to be able to afford\n\u2018actual\u2019 ham, that\u2019s thin).\nEverything about the first half of\nthe film screams \u2018I am terrible\u2019. It\nfeels almost impossible to care about\nany of the characters. The first bout\nof violence does at least seem to be\ngiven some form of consequences in\nterms of its impact on Ryan, but after\na couple of scenes of addressing this\n(extremely bluntly) that\u2019s it, it\u2019s done.\nAnd even then that glimmer of something deeper gets wiped out by the\nfact the choppy editing almost makes\nthe fight unwatchable. The sole redeeming feature is that it\u2019s bad enough\nto be funny, not just bad enough to be\nbad. So you can at least laugh at how\nterrible it is.\nAnd yet, after that first half, some-how, Shadow Recruit redeems itself.\nThe story remains utterly appalling,\nbut by that point, if you\u2019ve got any\nsense, you\u2019ve stopped caring. Fortunately, so do the writers. The far too\nwordy setup gives way to the payoff,\nand it\u2019s almost worth it. A restaurant\nscene that mixes in with Ryan breaking into the baddie\u2019s headquarters is\nnicely tense and almost engaging, before the action finally kicks off. And\nwith your brain firmly in \u2018whatever,\nI don\u2019t even care anymore\u2019 mode, it\u2019s\nactually pretty fun. The sins of the\npast hour fade away, and the kicks of\ndecent tension manipulation (even if\nthis is obviously a film where the hero\nalways wins) and neatly-handled action take over. It\u2019s nothing spectacular,\nand it certainly won\u2019t win any awards,\nbut it works. It does exactly what it\u2019s\nmeant to and nothing more.\nThe real saving grace for the film\ncomes from Chris Pine\u2019s earnest per-formance. He doesn\u2019t quite own the\nrole, not like Harrison Ford did, but\nthere\u2019s room for growth, and with a\nbetter script the franchise might actually take off again. Kevin Costner\u2019s\na complete badass, of course, but he\u2019s\nlet down by an otherwise boring role,\nas is pretty much everyone else. Keira\nKnightley gets completely shafted\nwith hers, while Kenneth Branagh\u2019s\nvillain just isn\u2019t scary. His motivation\nfeels somewhat lacklustre (side effect\nof that damned script), and his plan\u2026\nwhatever. I gave up at that point. It\u2019s\nrubbish, is the long and short of it.\nThe direction is competent (which\nis a pity \u2013 Branagh passed on Thor\n2 for this, and it really feels like a\nmissed opportunity on that front), the\nsoundtrack is generic and the visuals\nare\u2026 functional, so calling Shadow\nRecruit somehow greater than the\nsum of its parts isn\u2019t saying much. But\nit is, it really is. It relies far too heavily on you possessing the dual ability\nof laughing at terrible films and then\nswitching off into a mindless popcorn entertainment mode, but if you\ndo have that capacity, then it\u2019s decent,\nand worth a watch if you have two\nhours to waste and haven\u2019t seen The\nWolf of Wall Street or Inside Llewyn\nDavis (or pretty much any other big\nfilm on at the cinema) yet. I really wish\nI could pay it higher praise than that.\nA decent action flick let down by a terrible script.\nJack Steadman vs. Jack Ryan\n\n"

Chief Energy executive\nof IGas, Andrew Austin, hailed the\nmilestone as \u201ca further endorsement\nof the potential that exists.\u201d It bolsters\nthe findings of the British Geological\nSurvey: 1,300 trillion cubic feet of\nshale gas may lie beneath the north of\nEngland. To quote Joe Lynam, a BBC\nBusiness correspondent, a recovery\nof ten per cent for a resource this size\ncould satiate national energy demands\n\u201cfor almost fifty years.\u201d\nRecent developments, however,\nhave helped reinvigorate the intense\ndebate centred on the hydraulic\nfracturing practice. A balance\nbetween economic profitability and\nenvironmental sustainability has been\nadvised by many. A significant number\nof anti-fracking lobby groups have\nevolved to counter the stance of the\nGovernment on fracking. They fear\nthat any development of the practice\nwill be uninhibited and will be to the\ndetriment of environmental and social\nwell-being, rather than to improving\nthem.\nDevelopments within political\ncircles in County Fermanagh serve\nas a case in point. Local politicians\nhave proposed a local referendum on\nfracking. Many in the local community\n(justifiably) feel that their efforts to\nform an opinion on the process are\ncurtailed by a lack of Governmental\nclarity. In the words of a local Sinn\nF\u00e9in councillor, \u201cone of the things I am\nhearing is that people\u2019s voices are not\nbeing heard and decisions are being\ntaken miles away from where the\nactual mechanics of fracking are going\nto happen\u201d.\nOn the other hand many politicians\nhave hijacked the fracking agenda:\na contentious issue generally\npromotes voluminous and continuous\ndiscourse. This, in a way, might\nalso be construed as a betrayal of\npublic confidence. Northern Ireland\nMinister for Environment Mark\nDurkan denounced the Fermanagh\ndevelopments in an interview to BBC\nRadio Ulster:\n\u201cTourism is the key economic\ndriver in Fermanagh. What impact\nis the virtual rape of the Fermanagh\ncountryside going to have on tourism\nthere?\u201d\nIt is disturbing that a politician\nwould sensationalise their stance\non a complex issue and lace it with\nhyperbole, but it is not surprising.\nWhen viewed in panorama, the\nfracking debate is dynamic; and varies\nwith respect to each locality under\nconsideration. On the other hand\nthese localities (and their associated\ncommunities) tap into the wider,\nintegrated National Grid to obtain\ntheir electricity (excluding Northern\nIreland where an energy pact is\nEoghan Totten\nComment Editor\nFrench Energy Giant to Invest in UK Fracking\ncurrently in place).\nA July 2013 Ofgem report into the\nhealth of the UK energy sector proved\nto be both damning and harrowing.\nIt believes that spare energy margins\ncould plummet to as low as 2% by\n2015. To put this in the context of a\nDomesday scenario, if each household\nweretosimultaneouslytriptheirkettle,\nmajor and uniform blackouts could\ntake place. Ofgem\u2019s Chief Executive,\nAndrew Wright, was quick to vocalise\nhis anxiety: \u201cBritain\u2019s energy industry\nis facing an unprecedented challenge\nto secure supplies... Preventive action\ntaken now will help protect consumer\nsupplies\u201d.\nThe logical conclusion (on the part\nof the Government) is to galvanise\nmajor shifts in the balance of energy\nsources. There is already evidence of\nreal and tangible progress. October\n2013 saw George Osborne endorse\nChinese funding in future UK-based\nnuclear projects. Within a matter of\ndays EDF Energy (yet another French\nconsortium), kept afloat by a sizeable\nproportion of Chinese investors,\nagreed to development Somerset\u2019s\nHinkley Point C site. While the\ndevelopments were encouraging they\nare not sufficient in their own right\nto remedy the UK\u2019s skewed reliance\non North Sea gas and foreign coal,\noil and gas. It will provide no positive\nfeedback for the looming date of\n2015. Couple this with legal conflicts\nconcerning the Republic of Ireland\n\u2013 An Taisce, the National Trust for\nIreland, are considered legal action\nover the decision.\n\u201cDespite the nuclear power plant\nbeing nearer to the coast of Ireland\nthan it is to Leeds, the UK decided not\nto consult with the Irish public about\nthe decision before it granted consent\nin March,\u201d it said. \u201cThe first time many\nIrish people learned about the nuclear\npower plant proposal was when the\ndecision was announced.\u201d The UN\nImplementation Committee of the\nConvention on Environmental Impact\nAssessment in a Transboundary\nContext have also expressed concern.\nHydraulic fracturing is thus\nunderstandably attractive to a British\nGovernment obligated to \u2018keep the\nlights on\u2019. A sense of immediacy\nsurrounds the issue, heightened by the\nfinite term of the ruling Government:\nwhich, regrettably, when pared back\nreveals an ugly truth: pandering to\nvotes rather than to the higher cause.\nFracking in the United States (which\nwent from blueprint to production\nwithin a decade) demonstrates that it\ncan provide rapid energy stability.\nThe UK Government is not alone\nin this. Other nations within the\nEuropean Union are equally worried\nover long-term security. Instability\nin the Middle East has catalysed the\nenergy agenda (in addition to, one\nhopes, the monumental humanitarian\ncrises in Syria and the surrounding\nregion).\nA joint 2011 paper between\nKing\u2019s College London and the\nEuropean Centre for Energy and\nResource Security put forward some\njustifications for the recent fracking\n\u2018gas glut\u2019: \u201cFrom a global perspective,\nunconventional gas has far-reaching\ngeopolitical implications. It has the\npotential to balance the EU\u2019s energy\nequation by breaking a market\ndominated by a few suppliers.\u201d\nIt also proceeded to flag the\nmany emotive issues common to\nthe communities of Fermanagh and\nBalcombe alike.\n\u201cImportant questions about future\nmarket structure, the regulatory\nenvironment, political risk, investor\nconfidence...(all)needtobeanswered.\u201d\nIts chief insight was the identification\nof fracking as a redeeming player\nin the energy market. \u201cWith local\nunconventional gas availability\nenabling gas-to-gas competition,\nnegotiating power is shifting from a\nhitherto sellers\u2019 market into a more\nbalanced and favourable market for\nbuyers.\u201d\nThis is an important point. It serves\nto unify the chief objections of many\nto the practice of Hydraulic Fracturing\nin their local environment. The\neconomic benefits must not become\nalienated from their ultimate purpose\n(thebettermentofsocietalwell-being).\nGermany is a favourable case in point.\nDespite each federal State advocating\nits own energy policy things appear to\nmove forward. Perhaps the same logic\nmight be applied to UK fracking in the\nfuture, taking into account the fully-fledged economic and environmental\nimpacts for the higher cause.\nfrack-off.org.uk\nF\nollowing an email from the\nRector to staff last week it\nhas been revealed that parts\nof the Chemistry department\nwill be moved to the Imperial\nWest campus.\nAs part of recent study of critical\npathissuesontheentireCollegeestate,\nmaster planners have established\nseveral parts of the South Kensington\ncampus where space has become an\nissue. It was felt that the provisions for\nthese areas was below what College\naspires to as part of it\u2019s goal to become\na world leading adacemic institution\nin the coming years. These buildings\n(the Chemistry building, the Blackett\nBuilding and the Huxley building)\nhave been identified as being on the\n\u201ccritical path\u201d of the assessment due\nto the need of more space for core\nacademic functions in need of new\nfacilities that can be solved by new\nbuildings or refurbishment. It has\nbeen decided that some functions\nof departments will probably be\nrequired to relocate to the Imperial\nWest campus in order to acquire more\nspace.\nThe Chemistry Department has\nagreed with College Cabinet that\nChemistry has the highest need of\nnew space due to intensive laboratory\nuse and requirements and it has been\ndecided that the need to move some\nparts of the Chemistry to facilities\nis \u201cpressing\u201d. This has lead to the\ncreation of a detailed feasibility study\nof the possible options, along side\noptions for refurbishment and future\nuse of the building.\nIn response to our online article last\nweek, the Director of Undergraduate\nStudies for Chemistry left the\nfollowing comment: \u201c\nOf course, this is only the beginning\nof a process not the end. I spoke with\nTom (Head of Dept) and Debra (vice-Provost Education) over the weekend,\nthe Dept Rep, Catherine Lu, this\nmorning and intend to meet with all\nstudent reps... to work out how we\ninvolve all Chemistry undergraduates\nin the process of planning how\nChemistry undergraduate teaching is\ndeveloped at Imperial.\u201d\nChemistry building under consideration for future move to Imperial West\nJoe Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 31 JAN\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nPhilippa Skett on the silver lining that is coming to a crotch near you\nShine bright like a vagina\nW\nhat\u2019s hard,\nmetallic and\nfound down your\npants? Despite\nthe common\nanswer to this usually referring to\nsome sort of recreational, copulation\nmimicry device, perhaps owned by a\nmaternal figure, this time, the answer\nmay in fact be an anti-viral cream.\nA new cream containing silver nanoparticles is currently being developed that may control the transmission of HIV. After previous research\ndemonstrated that silver particles can\nhinder entry of the Human Immunodeficiency virus into a cell, the idea to\nincorporate it into a cream to ward of\nthe virus followed shortly after.\nResearchers from the University of\nTexas have developed a vaginal cream\nthat once applied, can take effect in\nless than a minute and can offer even\noffer protection for up to 72 hours.\nNot only that, but despite being targeted for vaginal application, because\nit effectively inactivates any traces of\nHIV, it can also protect any sexual\npartners too. It does this by essentially\ndisarming the way in which the virus\ntransmits its genetic material, by halting its transmission through the cervical mucous membrane.\nHIV is a retrovirus; it infects cells\nby injecting its own RNA genome into\nthe target cell. The RNA is then used\nto make strands of corresponding\nDNA to incorporate into the genome\nof the host. This injection of RNA is\nonly possible if the virus can adhere\ncorrectly to the cell membrane of the\ntarget cell, which for HIV is a subset\nof immune cells known as CD4 cells.\nCD4 cells can have various func-tions, but are so-called because of the\nglycoprotein on their surface, called\nCluster of Differentiation 4. This surface glycoprotein binds to another on\nthe HIV surface, called GP120, which\nensures HIV latches on to those immune cells to transfer its precious\nRNA cargo.\nThis is where silver comes in. Silver\nnanoparticles act as a microbicide,\nand attach to GP120 to block its adherence to other proteins. A novel\nfeature of this HIV treatment is that\nit therefore doesn\u2019t actually act within\nthe host cell to tackle the virus, but\ncan stop it in its tracks long before cellular infection.\nThe cream currently has shown\nsigns of success when tested on samples of human tissues, but some issues\nstill remain. Even if any inflammatory\nside effects of creams for such a delicate area are fully overcome, there still\nremains the costs of future clinical trials to consider too.\nHowever researchers are hinting\nthat the cream could be preventive of\nthe transmission of many other sexually acquired viruses, like the Human\nPapilloma Virus, or even for bacterial\nagents that may also be stifled by silver\nnanoparticles.\nHowever, the uses of the cream could\noutweigh the costs should it prove to\nbe a success. Not only could the cream\nbe used as a barrier during sex, but it\ncould also be applied to gloves to protect those dealing with contaminated\nblood too, or for those in the medical\nprofession to wear in surgery or clinics\ndealing with STI patients.\nFor now, the cream is still confined\nto the laboratory as opposed to the\nbedside table. However, it may only be\na matter of time before this life-saving\nsalve is slathered all over your hands,\ndelivering not just protection but possibly a bit of class too: no-one can say\nno to some silver lining in thier pants.\nimages-of-elements.com\nThe contents of your pants could one day look like this\nDo you find\nyourself\nsitting and\nwaiting for the\nconversation to\nswing back to\nscience?\nMaybe you secretly love science...\nDrop us an email \u2013 science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAnd we will take care of you.\nMax Hunter\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 31 JAN\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector masterclass: Joel & Ethan Coen\nPeter Brook\nStar Writer\nThe Coen Brothers have been able to\ncreate such strong, individual voices\nfor their characters for so long now\nit\u2019s hard to imagine a small town life\nin America without thinking about\nit in terms of Coen Brothers movie.\nThey have consistently been able to\ncreate complex and compelling narratives throughout their 16-film career\nand everyone of them brimming with\ndark, dark comedy. They have created\na very cohesive body of work which\nshares the use of many themes, tropes\nand stylistic choices to the point that\nit is blatantly obvious when you are\nwatching one of their films. They have\nmade a particularly strong use of musical and dance numbers that have\ncome to head in their latest work Inside Llewyn Davis.\nBlood Simple (1984)\nOpening with a situation found\nthroughout the Coens\u2019 work, a conversation taking place in a car on a\nlong straight road. The conversation is\nbetween a married woman and a man\nwho is not her husband as they drive\nto a motel for a liaison. The husband\nfinds out from a Private Investigator\nwho he subsequently hires to kill them\nboth. However with double crossing\nand chaotic misunderstandings we are\nleft with a darkly comedic piece with\nwonderful thriller edges. The killer is\nalso an archetype who we see again\nand again in the Coens\u2019 work; cold and\ncalculating often with psychopathic\ntendencies. Specifically in No Country\nfor Old Men where the duo have been\npraised by forensic psychiatrist Samuel Leistedt for portraying one of the\nmost true to life depictions of a psychopath in any movie.\nBarton Fink (1991)\nThis film is wonderful; it is the perfect combination of the Coen Bro\u2019s\nwonderful writing, dark humour and\nstrangeness with the brilliant production design of a Wes Anderson film. It\nfollows a very political playwright who\nsells out by moving to Hollywood to\nwrite for a studio. It follows his writers block and his almost literal descent\ninto hell. There is also a favourite Coen\nactor here too \u2013 the gabbling John\nGoodman. We quickly realise that\nJohn Turturro\u2019s character, the writer\nBarton Fink, is unable to write anything on demand and is a very closed\nminded person, but by the end of the\nfilm we wonder whether he deserves\nhis twisted comeuppance. The film is\nlittered with symbols, references and\nthe cult following that it built up sets\nthe scene for the incredible cult following of The Big Lebowski. But first\nmy personal favourite of the bunch\u2026.\nFargo (1996)\nFargo tells the story of a man (Wil-liam H. Macy) who wants his wife kidnapped so that he can take the ransom\nmoney that his wife\u2019s wealthy father\nwill pay. However, as is the norm with\nCoen Brothers\u2019 films, it does not go to\nplan. The bungling kidnappers carry\nout the kidnapping in a sort of violent\nslapstick routine, which is as horrible\nas it is hilarious. It opens with the title\ncard and then this message\n\u201cTHIS IS A TRUE STORY. The\nevents depicted in this film took place\nin Minnesota in 1987. At the request\nof the survivors, the names have been\nchanged. Out of respect for the dead,\nthe rest has been told exactly as it occurred.\u201d Now I actually think this is a\ntotal fabrication and at the time in an\ninterview and the real reason this title\ncard is there is explained by the this\nquote from Ethan:\n\u201cIf an audience believes that something\u2019s based on a real event, it gives\nyou permission to do things they\nmight otherwise not accept.\u201d\nThere are some terrible cold-blood-ed killings in this film by the typical\npsychopath archetype and his bumbling talking kidnapper buddy Steve\nBuscemi, they almost have a J and Silent Bob repartee, except they both kill\npeople. The big star of this movie has\nto be the yocal pregnant cop, played\nby Frances McDormand. She has\nbeen written wonderful dialogue for\nher comedic Minnesota accent and is\nthe character we sympathise with the\nmost and just puts in an utterly stellar\nperformance. This film also deserves\nspecific mention for its cinematography by the Coens\u2019 long time collaborator Rodger Deakins. Who makes these\ndesolate snowy backdrops infinitely\nbeautiful and as such the violence that\noccurs in them all the more perverse.\nThe Big Lebowski (1998)\nThis is the cult movie of our genera-tion. There is so much hidden joy in\nevery scene and so many quotable\nlines, it\u2019s no surprise that this is still on\nheavy rotation at the Prince Charles\nCinema where you can go to drink\nwhite Russians, wear a dressing gown\nand say repeatedly \u201cShut the fuck up\nDonnie!\u201d, \u201cThat rug really tied the\nroom together.\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s just like,\nyour opinion, maaaan.\u201d. It has some of\nmy favourite hallucination scenes as\nwell, there is nothing like a large scale\nbowling themed 1940s Hollywood\nMusical with all the dancers in amazing costumes set to Kenny Rodgers.\nThis is arguably the Coens\u2019 most\nfamous and deserves all the praise it\ngets.\nInside Llewyn Davis (2013)\nInside Llewyn Davis is a film that follows the life of a musician struggling\nto get by in the Folk Revival Scene in\nNew York circa 1960. It follows him\nthrough an awful few days, starting him with locking himself out of a\nflat that he was staying with the cat.\nWhich he can\u2019t return. It turns out he\nhas burnt many bridges and is generally disliked in the community.\nThe first thing to mention is that\nOscar Issac\u2019s portrayal of Llewyn\nDavis was fantastic; on top of this almost all of the songs were recorded\nlive on-set and are each played out\nin their entirety. Issac is clearly a very\ntalented musician. Alongside this the\nmusic is produced and writer T-Bone\nBarnett who created a litany of songs\nthat could just as easily been found on\na 1960s vinyl as in a the writings of a\nmodern film and includes one hilarious \u2018space race novelty song\u2019 that is so\nsilly and so of the time.\nUnfortunately, despite many interesting facets it turns out that Llewyn\nDavis is quite an unlikeable guy and\nspending this much time with wasn\u2019t\nalways very fun. Unlike last week\u2019s The\nWolf of Wall Street, where we spent\ntime with the unlikeable Jason Belfort,\nthere was a strong didacticism and the\npoint was clear that his behaviour was\nunacceptable. Here there didn\u2019t seem\nto be any strong message or point, and\nthough the Coens are known for putting deep hidden meanings in their\nmovies, this was being irritatingly\nobfuscating. Also the narrative arc\nwasn\u2019t just confusing but seemed to\ntotally lack cohesion. Though there is\na lot to enjoy, I would argue that this\nisn\u2019t one of the brothers\u2019 best.\n\n"

Man\nCity will be favourites, and rightly so,\nbut, they are far from rock solid at the\nback, whereas you can bet Jose Mourinho will not stand for any defensive\nmistakes. The more experienced of the\ntwo managers, Mourinho has successfully played for a 0-0 at both Arsenal\nand Man United already this season.\nI expect him to do the same on Monday and, while he will do well to keep\na clean sheet with the likes of Sergio\nAguero et al on the pitch, I do think\nMan City will struggle to outscore the\nBlues.\n1-1\nNewcastle v Sunderland\n(BT Sport 1, Saturday 12:45pm)\nIt seems an eternity ago that Paolo di\nCanio announced his arrival at Sunderland with an emphatic 3-0 win in\nthe corresponding Tyne-Wear derby\nlast season. Since then Gus Poyet has\nsteadied the ship, and Sunderland have\nnot lost on the road in the league since\nNovember. High-flying Newcastle\u2019s\nFrench contingent will provide a stern\ntest of their defensive credentials. On\npaper, the Magpies are stronger in\nevery department, but with precious\nlittle to play for, the Black Cats can\nextend their run of away form with a\nvaluable point.\n1-1\nWest Brom v Liverpool\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 1:30pm)\nThe Baggies had to fight hard to hold\nEverton in Pepe Mel\u2019s first outing in\ncharge, but for all their attractive play,\nthe Toffees do not possess the same\nclinical cutting edge in attack as their\nMerseyside neighbours. The lethal Suarez-Sturridge partnership is back in\nbusiness and although Mel will try to\nfrustrate the Reds, Brendan Rodgers\u2019\nside need a win to stay on course for a\ntop-four finish. That incentive should\nmake it a comfortable afternoon for\nLiverpool. Rather like Man City, you\nalways feel Liverpool can outscore any\nopponent.\n1-3\nArsenal v Crystal Palace\n(Sky Sports 1, Sunday 4pm)\nThe Gunners keep rolling on, and\nhave made a nice habit of cruising to\n2-0 wins in recent home ties against\nthe likes of Hull, Fulham and Cardiff. They know at least one of Man\nCity and Chelsea will drop points this\nweekend too.\n2-0\nWest Ham v Swansea\nMake no mistake, this is a relegation\nsix-pointer. For all their slick passing,\nyou could argue the Swans have been\noff song for a year now. The Hammers\nhave not won at home since the opening day, but with Andy Carroll back fit,\nthis is a great opportunity.\n2-0\nCardiff v Norwich\nThis is another massive game at the\nwrong end of the table, but Ole Gunnar Solksjaer will be hungry for a first\nhome win after an embarrassing home\nreverse to West Ham. Chris Hughton\u2019s\nCanaries do not win away often, especially when the pressure is not really\non\n1-0\nEverton v Aston Villa\nIt is always dangerous to back against\nVilla away \u2013 they showed yet again at\nAnfield that they are a different animal\non their travels. But the Toffees are in\nwith a real fighting chance of a European finish so Roberto Martinez will\ndemand nothing less than a win.\n2-1\nFulham v Southampton\nThe Saints are in a bit of turmoil at the\nmoment but do not seem to be letting\nthe off-field troubles affect their performances on the pitch. The Cottagers will have targeted this as a must-win match but they are just not in the\nsame league for me\n1-2\nChelsea vs. West Ham\n(Wednesday 7:45pm)\nTim Sherwood\u2019s Spurs are in fine form\nand even the very well-organised Tigers will have their work cut out trying to contain Emmanuel Adebayor\nand co. Spurs have to keep winning to\nremain in contention for the top four,\nand should prevail over the 90 min-utes.\n0-2\nStoke v Man United\nYou don\u2019t really know what you are\ngoing to get with Man United these\ndays. Some weekends they pick up\nroutine wins, others they slip to horror defeats. Although their record at\nthe Britannia is decent, Mark Hughes\nhas already claimed a few scalps there\nsince taking over.\n1-1\nJames White gives his midweek predictions\nA\nfter the initial blinding\nfrom the blonde hair\nand the fake tans, we\ncollected as a team.\nRomVom slotted in a\nquickie, smoothly followed by a mid\nair bitch slap into the net from 3 x a\nFish, and we pulled ahead.

To prove that\nthe average Imperial student\nhas the personality equivalent\nto a rock, you nominate him\nfor BNOC. You convince your\nfriends to write in letters to extol his virtues. They praise his\nstubborn approach to student\nrepresentation. A rockaye wins\nby a landslide.\nThis week, you find a rock lying on your roommates bed.\nYou decide that since you\ndo not have friends anyway,\nyou may as well adopt him\nas a pet rock. You decide\nto call him Wilson, and you\nbecome bestest of friends.\nHowever when trying to escape the clutches of Imperial\u2019s solitude, you lose him...\nWIIIIILLLSSOONNNNN!!!!\nThis week, you wake up as\nrock. Yes, a smooth, grey,\nemotionless rock.

All of a sudden you think its a good idea\nto run naked around campus,\nscreaming \u201cShine bright like vagina\u201d and eating lots of vagina\ncream. Your personal tutor sees\nyou, and immediately gives you\na first on your degree because\nyou \u201cshow initiative\u201d.\nThis week, feeling like flicking your bean after seeing\nsomeone run around naked,\nyou decide to use the rock\nyou found.

Both of these options\nare too horrible to consider, and\nbecause you can\u2019t decide, both\nhappen simultaneously. You go\ninsane and end up crying in your\nroom. At least you aren\u2019t \u2018that\ncreep\u2019, right?\nThis week, you finally tell\nyour medic crush how you\nfeel.

Looking at the beat\nup genitalia, you wonder why you\ndeserved this torture. As you induce labour, you swear to yourself that you\u2019re actually going\nto follow your twerking dreams.\nThen the rock slips into your outstretched hands...pint?\nThis week, so tired of having to\nlisten to your roommates wail-ing, you move to the library.\nOut of unused books you build\nyourself a castle, and proclaim\nyourself lord of the top floor.\nSoon the cleaners declare war\nupon you. You successfully\ndefend your keep at the battle\nof silent space, securing your\nrule.\nThis week, you walk past the\ndestruction of the library battle.\nYou think to yourself, at least\nyou are not as crazy as that\nweird knight guy. Then you remember that you are actually\na hipster and everyone really\nhates you. Oh well, at least you\ndon\u2019t live in a castle made of\nold books right?\nThis week, after failing yet another coursework. You dream\nthat you become a rock, become BNOC and end up in\nsomeones vagina.

I\u2019m the only girl in my group\nof friends, which means that I\u2019m\nconstantly surrounded by guys. This\nsounds great, but it\u2019s a massive pain as\nother guys never dare to approach me.\nWhat can I do to get around this?\nCockblocked in Cockfosters\nHave you considered that one of\nyour male friends might actually be\nthe way to go? If you really want to\nbranch out, why not try manning up\nand approaching the guys yourself? It\nreally isn\u2019t as scary as it sounds. If you\nthink a guy is eyeing you up from afar,\njust go and say hi. If that\u2019s too brave for\nyou, why not separate yourself from\nyour friends and make yourself more\napproachable?\nHelp! I have a massive crush on my\nlecturer. I can\u2019t pay any attention in his\nlectures, and when we\u2019re alone during\noffice hours, I swear he feels the same!\nWhat should I do?\nBesotted in Baron\u2019s Court\nI\u2019m gonna be honest with you, babe,\nyou\u2019re young. He\u2019s probably old. Why\ndon\u2019t you go for someone your own\nage? Imperial is a goldmine of fresh\nyoung men. And he probably doesn\u2019t\nthink of you that way, that\u2019s just wishful\nthinking. Whatever you do, don\u2019t\nrisk any embarrassment by making\na move. He might be entertaining a\nfantasy of the hot young student, but\nmaking fantasy a reality doesn\u2019t always\nlive up to your expectations\u2026\nHelp! I was too shy to make any\nfriends during Freshers week, and now\neveryone\u2019s formed groups of friends\nin Halls and on my course, and I\u2019m\nalways left out. How can I make friends\nthis late in the year?\nLonely in Ladbroke Grove\nThis is a really easy trap to fall into\nfor the introverted Imperialite. But\ndon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s still easy to make\nfriends! It\u2019s not too late to join a\nclub or society, which is a really easy\nway to meet a bunch of new people.\nIn Halls, you can just hang around\ncommon areas and occasionally try\nand join conversations, and people\nwill automatically start incorporating\nyou. On your course, you can hang out\nwith people after tutorials and lectures\n\u2013 drag out any social interactions and\npeople will start including you.\nHelp! I\u2019m a plus size guy, and I want to\nchange, I want to start getting healthy,\nbut I\u2019m scared that if I go to the gym,\npeople will laugh at me. What can I\ndo?\nOverweight in Oval\nMost people at the gym will have\nserious respect for anyone who wants\nto make a positive change in their\nlife, and will, if anything, be helpful.\nAnyone who\u2019s a douche is probably a\ndouche to everyone, probably because\nthey have a tiny penis. Anything they\nsay isn\u2019t personal, don\u2019t worry about\nit. However, if you really don\u2019t want\nto face the gym, there are plenty of\nother ways. For the ultimate people\navoidance, late night jogging is easy,\nand the powers of little things like\nwalking instead of taking the bus\nshouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\nHelp! My girlfriend\u2019s moving away for\nsix months in March, and we haven\u2019t\ntalked about what\u2019s going to happen\nwhen she leaves. We haven\u2019t been\ntogether that long, is it too soon to try\nand make it work long distance?\nWorried in Waterloo\nMaintaining it over long distance\nwill put an extra strain on your\nrelationship, that is more likely to\nmake it break. It\u2019s hard to keep that\nkind of trust, especially if you haven\u2019t\nbeen together for long. If you really\nlove each other, you can easily get\nback together when she comes back,\nand you might even find that neither\nof you want to get with anyone else\nwhen you\u2019re apart. It is possible to do\nlong distance though, so have a really\nhonest conversation about it before\nshe leaves.\n1. Be confident\nIf you always act confident, you\u2019ll look confident. If you look\nconfident, people will think you\u2019re confident. And believe it\nor not, that\u2019s hot. Anyone, male or female, loves to be asked\nout. If you find someone attractive and ask them to go for a\ndrink, you stand as much chance as any of them saying yes.\nIf you don\u2019t know them it\u2019ll be a purely physical decision, but\nat least that takes the pressure off in terms of being rejected.\nAfter all, you\u2019re much more than a pretty face.\n2. Be friends\nIt\u2019s unusual for a romantic connection to develop without\nsome sort of friendship forming first. When you first meet\nsomeone, be flirtatious, but not to the point that they\u2019re\nintimidated by you. It\u2019s a lot easier to see if you like them,\nand get to a point where it\u2019s easy to ask them out. After all,\nis it weird between friends to suggest that you do something\ntogether?\n3. Be sneaky\nYou don\u2019t have to go up to someone and say, \u201cWill you go\nout with me?\u201d If you\u2019re really nervous, you don\u2019t even have\nto directly ask them to hang out with you. If you\u2019re already\nfriends, you can arrange to hang out as a group, and\n\u201caccidentally\u201d tell them to arrive earlier, or \u201ccoincidentally\u201d\nhave everyone else cancel. If you get caught out, you can\nalways pretend that you made a mistake. The key is to make\nit easy for them. Let them see how you get on when you\u2019re\nalone. Once this idea is in their head, they\u2019re more like to\nmake a move. But remember, you can take a horse to water,\nbut you can\u2019t make him drink.\n4. Be bold\nIf you do it with confidence, you can pull off anything. Make\nit seem like it\u2019s no big deal. Ask someone out with enough\nswag and if they turn you down you can strut away with your\nhead held high and leave them feeling rejected. Don\u2019t be\nafraid to turn it back on them if it goes wrong, \u201cYou thought\nI was asking you out?

    "content": "31\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 31 JAN\nFILM\n2014 at the Oscars - we were robbed\nTom Hanks\nFirst everyone thought a double-nomination was well in the works for\nHanks, Best Lead Actor for Captain\nPhillips and Best Supporting Actor\nfor Saving Mr Banks (he did play Walt\nDisney). Then they thought nah... a\ndouble nomination could be too gen-erous. So just the one for Captain\nPhillips will be an easy score. Right?\nBut no, the Academy shut him out\ncompletely. So much for being a dou-ble-nominee eh? The miss for Captain\nPhillips is a real upset and surprise\nhowever, since his breakdown in the\nfilm\u2019s final moments alone should at\nleast have warranted a nomination.\nThe Butler\nEarly on in the race, Oprah Winfrey\nwas a sure front-runner to be nominated for and ultimately win the Best\nSupporting Actress award. Then 12\nYears a Slave came out when Lupita\nNyong\u2019o practically stole the limelight\noff of Winfrey. Forest Whitaker was\nalso a favourite when the film was re-leased. Best Film, Best Director, Best\nScreenplay, were all up for grabs but\nalas, Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler walked\naway with nothing. That\u2019s right, not a\nsingle nomination for this inspired-by-a-true-story biopic of a White House\nbutler. Shows even ticking all the right\nboxes doesn\u2019t work sometimes.\nRobert Redford\nYes, that\u2019s Robert Redford. Robert\nRedford a few decades ago but Robert Redford nonetheless. Redford has\nin fact publically spoken out about\nhis lack of Best Actor nomination,\nblaming the studio for not spending\nenough on marketing and promoting\nhis performance in All is Lost, a one-man survival thriller at sea. Is he just\nbeing a sore loser? Perhaps, but he\ndoes also have a point. All is Lost was\npractically dumped by Roadside Attractions, its distributor, as it started\nto perform less than ideally at the box\noffice. A real blow to the veteran who\nclearly deserved a nod.\nInside Llewyn Davis\nThere are some years when the Academy cannot get enough of the Coen\nbrothers (just look at how they swept\nthe board in 2008 with No Country for\nOld Men). The same however, could\nnot be repeated for 2014, when their\nlatest folk-music drama Inside Llewyn\nDavis only managed two nominations\nin technical categories (i.e. the ones no\none outside the movie industry really\nremembers or cares about). Not even\nOscar Isaac\u2019s singing voice of an angel\ncould sway the voters, and to be hon-est, if that couldn\u2019t do it, no film magic\nthe Coens could conjure up would\nhave scored anything.\nFruitvale Station\nThe critical success at 2013 Sundance\nFilm Festival was all but forgotten as\nthe dramatic retelling of the tragic\nkilling of Oscar Grant was completely\noverlooked. Not even a Best Supporting Actress nod to the deserving\nOctavia Spencer. Seems the hype and\nattention surrounding the film fizzled out and couldn\u2019t sustain its buzz\nfacing competition from strong December films. It would have been a\ntriumphant rags-to-riches story had\nthis been given some sort of recogni-tion, but Ryan Coogler\u2019s debut feature\nwill have to settle for a handful of Best\nBreakthrough awards.\nRush\nAbsolutely nothing for Ron Howard\u2019s\ncritically-acclaimed Formula 1 biopic\nRush. It was never going to be in for\nthe big awards, but some nominations\nin the technical categories (cinema-tography, sound, production design\nin particular) were certainly expected\nand deserved. Plus some were hoping\nfor Daniel Bruhl to squeeze his way\nin to the Best Supporting Actor race.\nSadly, nothing came to fruition, and\nthe gripping James Hunt-Niki Lauda\nrivalry drama walked away empty-handed. Doesn\u2019t mean the film isn\u2019t\nany good \u2013 your pulse will be racing\nfrom start to finish.\nJoaquin Phoenix\nThere was love for Spike Jonze\u2019s futuristic science-fiction romantic-comedy\nHer, but none for the leading actor\nwho made it all the more touching and\ngave it the much-needed human spin,\ndeeper connection and understanding\nto a plot that initially comes off as being too quirky and unrelatable. Was\nthe Academy put off by his negative\nattitude towards the awards season?\nOr was the competition really that stiff\nthis year? I say get rid of Christian Bale\nof American Hustle and replace him\nwith Phoenix for the absolute best of\nthe best of 2013. So far no Oscar wins\nfor Phoenix which is sacrilege.\nEmma Thompson\nPerhaps the most shocking of all acting snubs, Emma Thompson, putting\non an icy but incredibly moving and\nlayered performance as P. L. Travers\nin Saving Mr Banks, was outrageously\nignored by the Academy. Sure the\nBest Actress award is definitely going to Cate Blanchett, but Thompson\nwas sure to be a more than worthy\nnominee. So who stole her spot huh?\nAmy Adams? Sandra Bullock? Meryl\nStreep? Dame Judi Dench? The least\ndeserving on the list (though it breaks\nmy heart to say it) is Adams. Trying to\ncompare Adams to Thompson is just a\nlaughable, unbelievable insult.\n\n"

It was inconceivable to\nthink that a newspaper such as Felix,\nwhich already had a brilliant website\nto accompany the printed version, did\nnot have its own app for students to\nbrowse on the go.\nME: During your coding stage did\nyou encounter any problems? Did\nyou have to omit any features (e.g.)?\nKW: There weren\u2019t any major\nproblems. The API wasn\u2019t well suited\nto an iPhone app, so I came up with\nways to work around that. The maker\nof the API, Jonathan Kim [an imperial\nalumni, who also made the website],\nis currently working on a new version\nthat would ensure the next update of\nthe app works more efficiently.\nKW: Users can (predictably) browse\nthrough the latest articles from Felix.\nIn addition to this, we have a sidebar\nthat offers many social features. One\ncan create their own account and post\nto discussion boards, \u201clike\u201d articles\nand connect with other users. From\nearly indications, it can be said that\nit makes for a much more interactive\nuser experience.\nME: What are the some of the\ncurrent problems with the app?\nKW: We are taking a look at ways of\nimplementing a comments section.\nUnfortunately the only true way of\nfinding problems is by users reporting\nthem. Fortunately, this hasn\u2019t\nhappened yet.\nME: In your opinion, why should\npeople use the app?\nKW: For the exact reasons we created\nit. It is useful for following Felix on the\ngo. Our social features also enhance\nthe Felix experience.\nME: What are your future plans for\nthe app?\nKW: There are many. As I said\npreviously we are looking at\nimplementing a comments section.\nAnother item on the list is the\naddition of an issue archive, allowing\nstudents to browse past editions. But,\nas is the case for most apps, we will\ntry to implement what the user wants\nus to implement. There is a feedback\nsection in the app\u2019s sidebar that can be\nused for this, or you could send us an\nemail at felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAt this point the app is only available\nfor iOS sadly, however there are\nplans for an android app. If you do\nown an iOS device and want to try\nout Kunal\u2019s great work, either scan\nthe QR code on the left or just head\nover to the App Store and search\n\u201cFelix Imperial\u201d.

Flyers\nthat seem to have the word yolo\nwritten on them. However fear not\nmy dear students, our university\nhas not descended into a swag-palace.

Emails from sabs,\nposters and/or flyers have been\nalmost ever present since the launch.\nHowever for those of you who do not\nknow what yoyo is here is a quick\noverview. It is a company funded by\nImperial that is meant to counter the\nyearly calls for allowing payments\nwith our college ID cards. Capitalising\non the prevalence of smartphones and\nthe rise of mobile payments, we now\nhaveanappforiOSandAndroidwhich\nallows you to pay at all taste imperial\noutlets (which excludes the union).\nYou connect your bank account to the\napp, then load it up and are good to\ngo. At the actual till all you do is pull\nout the app, let the cashiers scan the\nQR code that your phone shows you.\nNow as a lazy imperial student (I\nknow why I am one), you are probably\nwondering why should I go through\nthe hassle of downloading an app\n(gasp, such an effort!) and linking my\nbank account to it? Well imagine this\nscenario: You have just gotten out of a\nhorrible double lecture, haven\u2019t eaten\nfor an age and generally feel like you\ntake a large bite out of anything that\nstumbles across your path. As you\nmake your way to your food stop of\nchoice you suddenly remember that,\ndamn, you have no cash. Sighing, you\nmake your way to the cash machine.\nAs you arrive a look of horror spreads\nacross your face as a line starting at\nthe ATMs going all the back to south\nkensington station fills your view. You\nain\u2019t going to get your lunch easy. This\nis where Yoyo steps in. You can cut\nout the entire cueing by just topping\nup your account on your phone,\nentirely on the go. Furthermore the\nfact that you do not need to fumble\nfor cash at the register means that\nonce you have scanned your phone\nyou are good to go. Imagine if\neveryone had this? It would make\ngetting food so much more quick and\nefficient, and that\u2019s what we imperial\nstudents like right? So essentially the\nreasons that you should go for Yoyo\nis because of the hassle yo safe if you\nare cashless and looking to get it at\npeak hours, as well as the speed you\ncan check out without any change\nfalling potentially falling to the floor.\nOn the other hand what are the\ncons of getting Yoyo? There are\nactually quite a few, related to\nsecurity. Pretty much, if you lose\nyour phone and you have no security\nmeasures they at leisure to spend as\nmuch as they want on your account.\nFurthermore if you are pretty open\nwith your account details you should\nalso be worried, as anyone can set\nup a Yoyo account with your details\nwithout any further verification.\nIn my own experience of using the\napp, I have generally not encountered\nany problems. The quickness and ease\nof paying with my phone is something\nthat I have thoroughly enjoyed.\nFurthermore if you are planning to\nuse Yoyo, then start today! Today\nis the last day that when you top up\nyou get a 10% bonus! My last piece\nof advice, even though this thing\nis pretty useful, carry some cash,\nbecause everyone knows: Cash is king\nPaying in style: #yoyonotyolo\nME: What are the main features of\nthe app?\nMaximilian Eggl, interviewing Kunal Wagle, creator of the Felix app\n\n"

    "content": "26 FRIDAY 31 JAN\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nI\nhave managed to catch\nProvidence based alt-country\nact Deer Tick a couple of times\nat festivals before. I allegedly\nfirst caught them back in 2010,\nalthough the performance was\nunmemorable to the point where\nI actually have no memory of the\nset. Of course, this could well not\nbe indicative of the quality of the\nperformance; I have forgotten any\nnumber of mid-afternoon festival sets\nover the years.\nThe second time I caught them was\na few years later, and at an even more\nridiculous time. They were doing a secret set at 3am in the smallest tent. To\ndescribe them as drunk would be an\nunderstatement, for which, given the\ntime they started, I really can\u2019t blame\nthem for. I was stewarding at the time,\nso I was (fairly close to) sober during the set. This means I remember\nwith 100% clarity the end of the set,\nwhere singer John McCauley played\nDeer Tick (but no Lyme Disease)\nAMS album of the week\nEd: OK, so technically this week it\u2019s\nEP of the week rather than album.\nSorry.\nSince releasing Kingdom of Dogs\nin 2009 and Island Living in 2010,\nWelsh four piece Bastions have\nshowcased a talent for writing bleak,\narty and desperate songs, a talent\nthey expanded on for their 2011\nfull length release Hospital Corners.\nWhilst previous releases have been\nconceptually driven (Island Living is\nbased on living in a small town and\nHospital Corners is based on Bastions\u2019 vocalist\u2019s experiences working in a\nmental asylum), none have been as bold as their two part Bedfellows series.\nReleased in two parts (started with 2013\u2019s The Bastard Son), it tells a story\nof two siblings unable to cope with being abandoned by their father. Partially\nbased on the institutionalisation of vocalist Jamie Burne\u2019s grandmother, the\ntwo EP\u2019s delve into the mental health issues faced by the siblings. Despite\nbeing released a whole year apart the two parts work well together, both\nconceptually and musically, with the ep\u2019s arguably representing Bastions\nfinest work.\nThe Forgotten Daughter shows a grittier side to Bastions sound. Beginning\nwith the brooding and swaggering Empty Vessels, contrasting Burne\u2019s\npoetic lyrics with bluesy guitars building to shouted climax. Foreign Bodies,\nMothers Ruin and The Water Tower follow showing a nastier side to Bastions\nsound with Foreign Bodies and The Water Tower featuring drumming that\nwouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Converge or a Cursed record. Mothers Ruin\nplays verses featuring almost droning guitar lines against choruses which\nfeature Burne\u2019s thin vocal style at its most desperate.\nThe EP doesn\u2019t slow down until the fifth and final acoustic led track.\nFeaturing a slow distorted guitar riff and again building to a climax before\ndying down to close the EP.\nWhile no means a perfect EP, Bedfellows Part 2 showcases a band not\ncontent with writing lazy drone riffs and utilising predictable beatdowns\nto satisfy mosh bros but willing to push the artistic limits of the hardcore\ngenre.\nBastions \u2013 Bedfellows Part 2: The Forgotten Daughter\nthe guitar with his penis. Not even\nslightly kidding. Genitals aside, the set\nwas incredibly good fun. I would say\nI\u2019ve never enjoyed sobriety at 3am so\nmuch in my life.\nI was therefore really excited to catch\nthem again at the Garage in Islington\nlast week. I should probably put a disclaimer here that I am by no means an\nalt-country expert. My knowledge is\nlimited to about three bands I\u2019ve seen\nat festivals and thought were pretty\ngood. This meant that the crowd for\nthis gig was not quite what I\u2019m used\nto. The average age was definitely a\nlot higher than my own, and the percentage of men with beards and plaid\nshirts was mind-boggling. This meant\nthat the bar was a lot busier than at the\nmajority of gigs (apparently old people\nhave lots of money to spend on drinks\nfor themselves and J\u00e4germeister shots\nfor strangers), and so, after a painfully\nlong wait, my friend and I finally managed to get ourselves a pint and settle\nin for Deer Tick.\nThe crowd were definitely pretty\ndrunk again, but the band seemed\nto be a lot more sober. This is most\nobviously attributed to their more\nsensible stage time, but they do have\na reputation. It might not be cocks\nslapping strings every show, but they\nare well known for rowdiness. The\nmore subdued set might be down to\nthe presence of John\u2019s wife, pop-singer\nVanessa Carlton, who even came on\nto perform her duet with the band, In\nOur Time, although I admit that meant\nvery little to me until I googled her.\nThe two got married last December\nwith Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac\nofficiating the ceremony. I couldn\u2019t\nthink of a way of seamlessly dropping\nthat in, but come on, Stevie fucking\nNicks. That is knowledge worth having awkwardly shoehorned in.\nThe actual music was up to its usual\nquality. Renditions of early fan favourites Dirty Dishes and Ashamed\nwent down an absolute treat. The\nnewer tracks were also generally well\nreceived, including excellent performances of The Dream\u2019s in the Ditch\nand The Rock. It was definitely further\nincentive for me to give the new album a proper listen.\nThe undoubted highlight for me was\na performance of These Old Shoes.\nTaken from their 2007 debut album,\nWar Elephant, it has long been my\nfavourite Deer Tick track, and live it\u2019s\neven better.\nThe whole thing just felt like something was missing. I mean, it was a\ngood show, but I can\u2019t help but compare it to the brilliance of the last\ntime I saw them, but this felt a little\nflat. Maybe it was the more subdued\nnature of the band, maybe it was the\natmosphere, maybe it was the new al-bum, maybe it was me. Whatever the\ncase, this time the stars didn\u2019t align,\nand I couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly\ndisappointed.\nStuart Masson reviews the alt-country band\u2019s Garage performance\nR\nave is not a word I would\never have associated with\nthe music of Mogwai. As\npeople, it makes a bit more\nsense. They has always\nbeen a certain distance between them\nand the more pretentious attitudes\nmost post-rock bands employ. On a\nMogwai album, you won\u2019t find made-up languages (I\u2019m looking at you Sigur\nR\u00f3s), songs about bizarrely specific\nhistorical events (iLiKETRAiNS,\nand I could have picked on the\nstupid typesetting as well) or any of\nthe myriad of pretentious bullshit\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor do.\nMogwai have always insisted they\njust make rock music. During live\nperformances, they talk about football\nand other bloke stuff in between\nsongs. The idea of them going to raves\ndoesn\u2019t sound completely nonsensical.\nEither they don\u2019t go to raves, they are\nso out of it at said raves that they\ndon\u2019t know what happened or they\njust didn\u2019t put that much thought into\ntheir album title, because this isn\u2019t\nsuitable music for raves. This is the\nsame post-rock they\u2019ve been chugging\nout for years.\nMogwai\u2019s first three records, Young\nTeam, Come on Die Young and Rock\nAction were all fantastic slices of\ninnovative exciting post-rock. Their\nfourth, Happy Songs for Happy People,\nis an absolutely beautiful record, and\nstands as one of my all time favourite\npost-rock records. It was here that\nthings took an inevitable down turn.\n2006\u2019s Mr. Beast features most of\nthe bands best known tracks, and is\ncertainly a really good listen. It\u2019s not\nexactly groundbreaking though, and\nmarked the point at which Mogwai\nseemed to stop caring about being\nahead of the scene. Their albums up\nto this point stood in contrast to the\nvast majority of post-rock, but from\nMr. Beast onwards that stopped being\nthe case.\nIn the years following that we\u2019ve had\nThe Hawk is Howling and Hardcore\nWill Never Die, But You Will and\nnow this one, Rave Tapes. They are all\nservicable albums, but they\u2019re all quite\npost-rock by numbers. Once you\u2019ve\nlistened to Mr. Beast, or you know,\nGod is an Astronaut, you\u2019ve kind of\ncovered the territory. I\u2019m not a fan\nof bands who just keep releasing the\nsame material but slightly worse each\ntime. If you\u2019re going to start releasing\npoor albums, at least take a risk, and\nthat\u2019s something Mogwai don\u2019t seem\nwilling to do any more.\nI suppose I should say something\nabout the music on Rave Tapes.\nIt\u2019s adequate. In fact, the opener,\nHeard About You Last Night is a\nreally nice track. With some ambient\nleanings, it reminds me slightly of the\naforementioned Happy Songs which is\na great thing (I appreciate how bitter\nI\u2019m starting to sound, I\u2019ve no intention\nof keeping it in check). The spoken\nword sample in Repelish makes for a\nfairly refreshing listen, whilst Hexon\nBogon is legitimately a pretty tasty\nRaving on About Mogwai Going to Shit\nStuart Masson\nMusic Editor\npost-rock number.\nThe rest of the songs here aren\u2019t\nreally anything to write home about.\nThe main innovation that came with\nMr. Beast was the addition of vocals\non a few tracks. They kind of worked\nthere. Sadly, that is no longer the case.\nThe only track here that has singing,\nBlues Hour, is a dreary pile of shit. The\nrest of the tracks are just forgettable.\nIt\u2019s a shame, because I still have quite\na bit of space to fill, but there\u2019s really\nnothing I have to say about them. I\nmean it\u2019s also a shame because this is a\nband who I have loved for many years,\nand this has just bored me.\nMogwai are still a credit to\nBritish music. I would certainly still\nrecommend going to see them live.\nThey are always loud as fuck, which\nmakes even their most mundane\nmaterial sound a bit more exciting.\nThey also still play loads of their old\nstuff. On record, it\u2019s getting to the\npoint where me recommending them\nis going to have to come with the\nstandard hipster caveat: start with the\nearly stuff.\nRob Garside\nDeer Tick\u2019s latest album, Negativity\nUnfortunately I couldn\u2019t find any knob pics\n\n"

There, I said it,\nI outed myself as a Belieber. I am\na self-confessed fan of The Biebs.\nI know that this proclamation\ngenerally elicits a fairly strong\nreaction, but let me defend this view\nbefore you cast me out to the place\nwhere Directioners go to die.\nSo I\u2019ll start with his music. This is\nprobably his weakest point, let\u2019s be\nhonest. It\u2019s mostly pretty terrible,\ndesigned to draw out those girlish\nsqueals from teenage girls. The vast\nmajority of the songs that he releases\nin the States do fairly badly here;\nyou never hear them on the radio or\nplayed in public places (except maybe\nTammyGirl, or wherever these just-about-pre-pubescent girls shop these\ndays). Despite this, it\u2019s hard not to\nadmit that some of his songs are\ndistressingly catchy. You might find\nthe vocals grating, but who doesn\u2019t\nlove a bit of Baby (baby baby oh) now\nand again? The horrendously cheesy\nvideo to Beauty and a Beat mars it\na bit, but the inappropriate use of\nNicki Minaj brings it back, and I\u2019m\npretty sure that his music triggers my\nseratonin production, it makes me\nhappy. While I\u2019m sure that conclusive\nproof is not priority research, I\u2019m sure\nit\u2019s not just me that feels this way. Yes,\nit\u2019s painfully cheesy, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s\nso wonderful!\nHis merchandise is a demonstration\nof some of the most successful\nmarketing in history. He\u2019s made\nmillions from the ability to get little\ngirls to fawn over his products.\nEvery single item that bears his name\nis arguably horrible, but what it\nrepresents is magnificent. I can\u2019t help\nbut admire someone who\u2019s managing\nto make a fortune and take over the\nworld, purely based on the parental\npersuasion powers of little girls.\nExtending from that, he\u2019s so polarising\nthat he\u2019s somehow managed to target\nthe ironic market without damaging\nhis success within it. Serious props to\nwhoever managed to do that!\nYes, these things are part of the\nBieber brand, not The Biebster himself.\nSo what about him? The hardcore\nBeliebers might love him because he\u2019s\nsuch a good person, but he\u2019s evidently\nnot a great demonstration of good\nbehaviour. He\u2019s been filmed with a\nBrazillian prostitute, arrested for\nracing supercars through the centre\nof Miami while under the influence\nof drink, drugs and prescription\npharmaceuticals, and had a capuchin\nmonkey confiscated at the German\nborder. His fans regularly threaten and\nintimidate anyone who they perceive\nas a threat, and despite their obvious\nhysteria (at least calling it Bieber Fever\nsounds vaguely sinister), he hasn\u2019t\ntaken any and all necessary steps to\nstaunch his idolaters. Obviously he\u2019s\nnot someone you should hold up as\na shining example, but what nineteen\nyear old is? Few teenagers ever come\nclose to experiencing the levels of\nfame, money and power that he has.\nHe\u2019s ignorant and completely removed\nfrom reality, and any mistakes he\nmakes are magnified a thousand times.\nHe exists in a world where everything\nhe does is publicised immensely, but\nhe is ultimately faultless. Everyone\ndoes stupid things when they\u2019re\nnineteen, but for most people the\nrange of shame extends at most to a\ncouple of degrees of separation.\nT\nhere is little doubt that\nwhen development involves\nthe empowerment of\ncommunities and spread\nof innovative ideas, lives\nwill be changed. From the poorest of\nthe poor to the war-torn regions of\nthe globe, issues concerning people\u2019s\nneeds and rights interlink each and\nevery one of us. When the standard\nof living and quality of life suffers in\nthe face of issues such as healthcare,\nfood scarcity and education, then\nonlookers beyond borders must\nact. Contributing to international\ndevelopment is of paramount\nimportance as we head into mid 21st\ncentury. From technology to policy or\nsocial movements, progressive reform\ncantakemanyguises.Theintroduction\nof large-scale, low cost vaccination\nto lower infant mortality, or strains\nof crop designed to survive harsh\nconditions to provide agricultural\nlivelihoods both exemplify actions\nthat have lessened huge health and\nenvironmental burdens on developing\ncountries. Yet, these reforms make the\nnews for their scale and involvement\nof international governments. Dig\nbelow the surface and you\u2019ll find a\nwhole host of progressive movements\nthat are revolutionising the face of\ndevelopment. And most of the time\nthese can be identified by three key\nfeatures: community, technology and\nthe presence of youth.\nOn average, 60% of the population\nin the world\u2019s poorest countries are\nunder 25 years old and are persistently\naffected by the problems that stem\nfrom poverty. From unemployment\nto HIV risk to poor governance, the\nproblems that young people face are\nonly exacerbated further by the fact\nthat young people are frequently\noverlooked or excluded from the\ndecision making practices that directly\nimpact on their lives. Corruption\nwithin schools often means quality\neducation is only available in exchange\nfor a sex act, or a back hander, and for\nmany young women there is often no\notheroptionthanengaginginriskyand\nexploitative activities.But when given\nthe opportunity, young people can and\nyoung people do. Which is why, at the\nImperial International Development\nConference 2014 we want to turn\nthe focus to the amazing things\nyoung people are doing globally to be\nrecognised as the solution to many of\nthe world\u2019s problems, and how young\npeople are paving the way for change.\nTechnology is also a huge driving force\nfor change. From instant messaging,\nto mobile-phone based sexual health\nlessons and solar drive technology\nfor refrigerating vaccinations, tech\nbased solutions are helping to address\nsome of the problems frequently\nencountered in developing countries.\nNot only this but they are providing\na tool to empower youth to be active\nparticipants in developing their\ncountry, to voice their opinions and\nideas about economic growth, and to\npromote social stability.\nOn the 15th February, highly\nacclaimed academics in the\ninternational development arena,\nfrom leading universities, institutes\nand NGOs, will offer up an incredible\nHugo Paquet explores international development\nIn defence of Justin Bieber\nI\u2019m not saying you should love him\nfor the same reasons that a besotted\nfourteen year old girl does; he loves his\nmom, he\u2019s proud of where he comes\nfrom, oh he\u2019s just like me, he loves\ncandy too! But don\u2019t hate him because\nhe does stupid things. His purpose is\nultimately to entertain, and whether\nit\u2019s because you\u2019re fawning over him or\nripping him to shreds, you\u2019re probably\nenjoying it. Even if you don\u2019t declare\nit outwardly, let him have that little\nwarm spot in your heart.\nAnd face it; he\u2019s just damn cute!\nLook at that little face!

    "content": "32 FRIDAY 31 JAN\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSherlock\u2019s success: It\u2019s Elementary?\nEmily Fulham considers a competitor to Sherlock\u2019s crown\nS\nherlock\u2019s third series\ndebuted on New Year\u2019s Day\nto tremendous hype. After\ntwo years of being off-air,\nfans were hoping that it\nwould match their high expectations.\nNow that the dust has settled on the\nlast of the three episodes, what was\nthe final verdict?\nAs with anything, it depends who\nyou ask. Sherlock seems to inspire\nmass hysteria in its fans: IMDB\ngives it a rating of 9.3/10 from its\nusers and critical opinion, making it\napparently better than The Shawshank\nRedemption (9.2), The Godfather (9.2),\nandCasablanca(8.6).UnlessI\u2019mliving\nin an alternate universe and watching\na vastly different show to everyone\nelse, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so controversial\nto posit that Sherlock might \u2013 just\nmight \u2013 be a tad overhyped.\nThe three episodes of the latest\nseries met with generally favourable\nreviews from critics, but divided\nopinions among fans. The Guardian\ndescribed the final episode as \u2018perfect\u2019,\nbut some viewers felt that the show\u2019s\nwriters were trying too hard to please\nthe hardcore fans of tumblr and the\nlike - the second episode was more\nreminiscent of some kind of bizarre\nfanfiction than a detective show -while more casual viewers were left\nbaffled at what the point to the ninety\nminute episode had been.\nThen there was a third opinion\noffered up: Sherlock might have lost\nits touch because, in its long two\nyear hiatus, a better successor had\ncome along. There have been no\nshortage of adaptations of Sherlock\nHolmes since Arthur Conan Doyle\npublished his novels: in the past\nfive years alone, we\u2019ve had the films\nstarring Robert Downey Jr. and\nJude Law, BBC\u2019s Sherlock, and now\nElementary. Sherlock was novel\nin that it transported the crime-solving detective to the present day.\nElementary takes things one step\nfurther, with an alcoholic Sherlock\nHolmes,playedbyJonnyLeeMiller,up\nand moving to New York, where Lucy\nLiu is Joan Watson, his sober - and\nfemale - companion. When Holmes\ndecides that the best way to spend\nhis recovery is to assist NYPD with\nsolving crimes, Watson reluctantly\naccompanies him to provide support\nfor the recovering addict.\nThe initial casting of Watson as a\nwoman was met with controversy,\nnot least of which came from angry\nSherlock fans. Steven Moffat himself,\nwriter and producer of the BBC\nshow, said he was \u2018annoyed\u2019 and\nworried about it \u2018debasing\u2019 the brand\n- presumably choosing to ignore the\nmany, many adaptations that had gone\nbefore his, including a 1986 Disney\nfilm in which Holmes was portrayed\nby a mouse. This provoked retaliation\nfrom those who felt that Sherlock had\nlost its touch, or indeed had always\nbeen overrated, with the result that\nbefore the first episode of Elementary\nhad even aired, it already had both a\nloyal fanbase and dedicated haters.\nSo who was right? At the risk of\npissing off the legions of Sherlock fans,\nI\u2019m inclined to say that Elementary\nhas the edge over its predecessor. It\u2019s\nby no means a perfect show, but is, in\nmy opinion, far better than the try-hard, self-indulgent mess that thinks\nit\u2019s cleverer than it is, which is what\nSherlock has become in recent years.\nOne of the big differences between\nthe two shows is the character of\nSherlock Holmes himself. The oft-repeated \u2018high-functioning sociopath\u2019\nof the BBC adaptation is callous, cruel,\nand seemingly incapable of forming a\nmeaningful relationship with anyone\nexcept John Watson - who, even then,\nhe still treats with a disturbing lack of\ndisregard. The partnership between\nHolmes and Watson in Elementary\nis far more equal, with Joan Watson\u2019s\ncompassion and resilience providing\na balance to the thornier personality\nof Holmes, who demonstrates\nrepeatedly that he can learn from\nothers and is even occasionally \u2013\nshockingly \u2013 nice. While this may be\nhard to imagine for anyone familiar\nwith Cumberbatch\u2019s portrayal, it\nactually bears far closer resemblance\nto the Holmes of the Doyle\u2019s original\nnovels who, although dispassionate\nand sometimes arrogant, is still\ncapable of sympathising with his\nclients and treating Watson with the\ncare and respect of a friend.\nElementary\u2019s main weakness lies in\nits format: Owing to it being a crime\nprocedural, episodes can seem at\ntimes formulaic, with each following\na fairly standard \u2018crime of the week\u2019\nstoryline. This is somewhat offset\nby the way that the victims are very\nrarely faceless bodies, and the help of\na strong supporting cast.\nAnother initial concern with the\nshow was that the decision to have\nWatson played by a woman was made\nto facilitate a romantic relationship\nbetween her and Holmes. Thankfully,\nthe show\u2019s creators have already said\noutright that a romance between\nthe pair is not on the cards and\nnever will be. Joan Watson is a well-rounded, sympathetic character,\nin sharp contrast to virtually all of\nSherlock\u2019s female characters, who are\ndefined entirely by their relationships\nto the two main (male) characters.\nSteven Moffat has been criticised\nfor his writing of women on several\noccasions, both in Sherlock and the\nnew Doctor Who. Sherlock\u2019s Irene\nAdler was a often-naked lesbian\ndominatrix who inexplicably falls\nin love with sloth-faced Benedict\nCumberbatch, culminating in her\nbeing rescued by him at the end of her\nstoryline. Elementary\u2019s Irene Adler,\nplayed by the brilliantly cast Game of\nThrones\u2019 Natalie Dormer, is, without\ngiving anything away, an ingenious\ntake on the character.\nI realise that there are those who\u2019ll\nremain unconvinced, not least big\nfans of Benedict Cumberbatch; I\u2019m\nprepared to admit that Elementary\nisn\u2019t for everyone. (Although,\nincidentally, both Holmes actors -Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee\nMiller - starred together in a recent\ntheatre adaptation of Frankenstein in\nwhich the actors alternated between\nplaying the doctor and his monster\non different nights, so they have more\ncommon ground than you might at\nfirst realise.)

Your mana slowly replenishes\nover time and you with every kill and\nmana are also the currency to purchase and upgrade towers and gems\nand many other traps and advantages.\nHaving a lot of mana will make you\nwithstand a lot of attacks but every\nso often a large monster will appear\nthat can crush your orb altogether.\nThe crux and strategy of the game,\nas the title suggests, is with the gems.\nThere are eight different coloured\ngems each hue with distinct special\nability in addition to their attack points\nsome of which include slowing down\nenemies, creating chain hits and reducing enemy armour. Gems can be\ncombined, combining the hues and\nretaining a portion of the special abilities from each gem. While most stages\nonly give you a few colours to use, you\ncan actually combine gems to increase\ntheir potency and give them new\nabilities. You can stick with the gems\nthe level gives you to begin with and\nthink strategically, or you can spend\nmana to instantly unlock any colour\nyou wish for the duration of the level.\nGems can be upgraded to increase\nattack speed, attack damage and attack radius, and upgrading the gems\nbrings about a different shape gem.\nA new addition to the labyrinth\nchapter is the \u2018apparition\u2019. These are\nrare innocuous beings that sporadically appear on a few maps that fly into\nand out of your view during the game.\nDestroying apparitions gives you upgrade points directly. Upgrade points\ncan be used to acquire advantages\nthat last through the entire game such\nas increasing your mana pool at the\nstart of every game or increasing the\npotency and special abilities of gems.\nGemcraft Labyrinth is entirely meri-tocratic, you can adjust the difficulty\nof the game on each map which gives\nyou extra XP points after you complete\nit which convert to upgrade points.\nGemcraft Labyrinth is a must-get\ngame for Tower defense game lovers\nand can be played for free on Armorgames and Kongregate. Game In a Bottlehasannouncedthatthesequeltothis\ngameChasingShadowswillbereleased\nshortly in the beginning of this year.\nTime to pack out Braid\nIndie Game the Movie is a great film\nfor games fans. It follows the creation\nand reception of 3 Indie Games; Super Meat Boy, Fez and Braid. I already\nhad played a lot of Super Meat Boy,\nand soon after the movie I caught Fez\nin a humble bundle. These were some\nof the best games I\u2019ve ever played and\nwere instant favourites of mine so it\nis of no surprise that once I finally\ncaught Braid on sale it instantly followed its predecessors into my top 10.\nBraid is a puzzle game created by Jonathan Blow. The film had showcased\nhow much time and effort he put\ninto making this game and the finished result echoes this. Visually the\ngame is stunning! Braid showcases a\nunique art style that I would describe\nas artistic Mario. It even has the\nsame kind of enemies and definitely\ntakes more elements from Mario, in\nits platforming style. A new enemy\nhowever is a killer bunny rabbit that\noften pops out of nowhere and chases\nyou, which I feel is definitely inspired\nby Monty Pythons the Holy grail.\nThe game itself sees you searching\nfor a Princess by traversing various\nworlds each made up of levels. At first\nI thought the game was a simple platform game, you can jump on enemies\nand climb up ladders and everything\nyou might expect (except run), but\nthe first time I died I got a big sur-prise. You can turn back time! Every\nmove you make can be reversed, and\nnot just for a few seconds. It is possible to rewind time all the way back\nto the beginning of the level. This\nmechanic is what makes Braid such a\nunique game. It makes each level into\na puzzle, rewarding you with jigsaw\npieces which can be made into a picture for each world. Some elements\nare immune to the time reversal\nwhich provides some great puzzles.\nHow do you get that key at the bottom of a pit? Jump down pick up the\nkey, and because the key is immune\nto time travel, simply time reverse\nso you exit the pit holding the key.\nBraid becomes progressively harder\nand each world adds a new mechanic\nwhich helps keep the game fresh and\nentertaining as you go through. One\nworld for example adds the ability to\nset up a sphere which slows the flow\nof time, and another has time linked\nto your steps meaning that the enemies can\u2019t get out of your way and\nyou need to be creative to get to the\nend. One great thing about Braid is\nthat you can just run through all the\nlevels, and have done all the worlds in\nminutes, but you don\u2019t get anything\nout of it. The game rewards getting\nthose jigsaw pieces and completing\nthe game properly and truly. It\u2019s an\neasy game to just jump in and out of,\ncollecting more jigsaw pieces each\ntime but also a game to get competitive at. It is almost made for a speed\nrun, and even sports a speed run\nmodeforthemorecompetitiveplayer.\nBraid caters to all types of gamer whether you just want to run\nthrough the game to say you\u2019ve\nplayed it, complete it 100%, play\nit casually from time to time or\nbe competitive and speed run it.\nIt\u2019s a charming game, unique and\ninventive, and really shows off\nwhat Indie games have to offer.\nI woke up to find myself cold and\nthirsty on beach in chernarus. All\nI had on me was a the clothes I\nwas wearing and a flashlight. Time\nto survive the Zombie apocalypse.\nI saw immediately a town sign\nwhich said \u041a\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043e\u0432\u043e which, I\nknew from my limited Russian,\nwas Kamyshovo. However my\nknowledge of my location did not\nhelp that much, and therefore in\ndire of need of water I decided\nto loot the nearby abandoned\nhouses. As I made my way through\nthe wreckage a glint on the floor\ncaught my eye. A compass! Now\nI could actually get somewhere.\nMy tired and thirsty mind vaguely\nremembered that due west of my\nposition there was the big town\nElectro, where I new that there\nwere several supermarkets which\nmust have some kind of food and\ndrink.\nIt was time to venture out onto\nthe road. I kept a low profile,\navoiding the lone zombie who\nstalked the countryside. Soon\nI arrived at the outskirts of the\ntown. Thinking it may be prudent\nto check the surrounding houses\nbefore I dived into a potentially\nfatal situation, I clambered through\na window to see if I could find\nanything. As I scavenged through\nthe houses I came upon a closed\ndoor. Not thinking anything of it,\nI entered,scanning the floor for\nloot. As I looked around, my eyes\nfell upon a two pairs of shoes. I\nlooked up in surprise and saw two\nhelmeted guys looking at me in\nsurprise, pointing their rusty M4s\nat my face. Before I could even\nutter an \u201coh\u201d, they opened fire on\nme. As I lay on the floor bleeding to\ndeath, I felt them rustling through\nmy clothes looking for anything to\nsteal. Couldn\u2019t even wait for me to\ndie couldn\u2019t they?\nDayZ Stories\nThe DayZ standalone has been\nreleased, and given the amazing\nstories that occur in that game, I\ndecided to make a kind of series\nout it!

The tips below are aimed at students who have recently started out cycling in London, so seasoned cyclists may want to look\nPractice makes perfect\nGetting a bike for the first time as a Londoner can be exciting \u2013 you\u2019ve just graduated into the lycra-clad elite. However,\nbefore you hasten out into rush hour in central London, it\u2019s a good idea to just have a quick practice around a quiet\nsuburban area or park first. Make sure you don\u2019t venture out until you\u2019re comfortable raising either arm for a turning\nsignal and you can look over your shoulder while still cycling in a straight line..\nSuit up\nOk, lycra isn\u2019t a necessity but it is true that cycling in winter can be rough \u2013 it\u2019s cold, it rains and the wind can be a\nnightmare. At a bare minimum you can make do with a lightweight waterproof you can stuff into a bag and a decent\npair of gloves. A helmet and reflective clothing are both very good ideas from a safety standpoint although not legally\nmandatory.\nBeware the lorry\nLorries and other heavy good vehicles (HGVs) pose a significant danger to cyclists, mainly due to the size of their\nblind spot. For a really good demonstration, check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9E1_1M-qhU. The\nadvice around HGVs is \u2018stay safe, stay back\u2019 and be particularly wary about passing on the left even if they are stopped\nat junctions.\nBe assertive\nYou may have seen the signs advising cyclists to ride a door\u2019s width from parked cars at bus stops around the Union.\nThis seems like pretty sensible advice but on the narrow roads around South Ken, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s\nfaced the odd impatient driver coming up behind you and making their presence known. Although it can be tempting\nto move right over to the left so they can try and squeeze past you, this is wrong. Cars should not be passing you if it is\nunsafe to do so - on narrow roads, you are within your rights to move into the centre of the road to prevent dangerous\novertaking if you think it\u2019s necessary.\nKeep safe, be seen\nLights are a legal requirement for cycling in the dark and should also be used in the rain or when it is overcast. Good\npractice seems to be a steady front (white) light and either a steady or flashing (red) light with accompanying red\nreflector. Wearing light-coloured or reflective clothing also helps.\nFind your way\nIf you\u2019re new to cycling and are used to getting the tube or bus, you might not be aware of the most cycle-friendly way\ninto College from your house. The site www.cyclestreets.net allows you to plug in your start and end address and it will\ngenerate routes for you based on your need for speed or the quietest roads which is really valuable when you\u2019re starting\nout or travelling somewhere new.\nThis week\u2019s wellbeing section is going to focus on\ncycling safety. In recent months, cycling has been in\nthe news following a spate of deaths in London, many\nof which involved incidents between cyclists and heavy\ngoods vehicles (HGVs). At the last meeting of the Union\nCouncil, the Union adopted a stance to lobby for improved\ncycling infrastructure as the lack of safe cycle routes is a\nproblem for many of our students.\nAs a cyclist myself, I can say with confidence that cycling\ninto College has a great number of benefits, not only\nfor your physical and mental health but also your bank\nbalance as you avoid the (ever-rising) TfL fares. However,\nit doesn\u2019t come without its drawbacks as, although I\u2019ve\nbeen fortunate to have not been involved in any serious\naccidents myself, I can\u2019t say the same for my friends. I\nthink one of the most difficult realisations that I\u2019ve had\nsince starting cycling is that no matter how competent\nyou become on a bike, you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s\nactions and ultimately in a competition between a cyclist\nand a motorist, the motorist will always win.\nStill, there are a few steps we can take, especially if we\u2019re\njust starting out, to help ensure our safety on the roads.\nWeathering the Storm\nWhat\u2019s On This Week in\nStress Less\nMindfulness Meditation - 4th & 11th Feb\nAn introduction to meditation not connected to religious tradition.

Once they snatch you, that\u2019s it,\nyou are there to the bitter end of a\nquestion. No matter if they are doing\ngreat by themselves, they need the\nattention in order to be able to do any\nquestion. Their brains simply cannot\nwork properly if there is not someone\non hand to sort everything out. The\nworst thing about these people is\nthat they are normally quite good and\ntheir craving need for attention means\nother people who really are struggling\nmiss out.\nThe Impossible:\nThese people believe that if\nthey cannot do the question, it is\nimpossible. There is absolutely no\npoint in checking their own work for\nmistakes or checking with a friend,\nbecause they are perfect and the\nquestion is wrong. Normally these will\nhave breezed through any prior work\nto a session, because it was easy, but\nstrangely none of their answers match\nthose given.\nThe Question Master:\nThere is always one in every year.\nThey are the ones who ask the\nquestions after a terribly boring\nguest lecture, which is useful, as to\nbe honest, who can think of anything\nanyway? But during a marked lab or\ndemonstration, it is not the time. Keep\nthese burning questions for after,\neveryone else has to pass too.\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 9\nThe Google it:\nThese are quite often well-meaning\nstudents, who simply are not doing\nenough work. They ask politely\nabout something, but after about five\nseconds with them, it dawns on a GTA\nthey know absolutely nothing about\na subject. The worst of these are the\npacks, which fire off question after\nquestion about stuff they should have\ndone at A level. Thus \u2018Google it\u2019 quite\noften comes to mind.\nThe Aggressive/Argumentative:\n\u201cI DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND THIS\u201d.\nStudents like this are the worst. I\nadmit I met one yesterday and frankly\nfelt I wasn\u2019t paid enough to deal with\nit, so I didn\u2019t. This is an immediate\nno brainer for a GTA.

Even\nGTAs have a limit.\nT\nhe British railway system is\nthe biggest example of the\nfailures of privatisation. I\u2019m\nnotoldenoughtoremember\nthe change, but I\u2019m sure the\narguments were the same as those\ntouted today for the privatisation of\nother well-functioning institutions:\n\u201cprivate companies will run an\nefficient service, and competition\nwith each other will improve that\nservice while driving down prices.\u201d\nThis school-level economic argument\nhinges on consumer choice, but when\nit comes to transport, there is none.\nI took the train home for Christmas.\nThe Virgin Pendolino service got me\nthere in an impressive two hours;\nhowever, even with a railcard and\nbooking weeks in advance, it cost over\n\u00a350. It was the first non-peak train\nof the evening, and was massively\noversold. People were sitting on the\nfloor, filling the aisles and blocking\nthe doors. Going to the toilet was\nan exercise in jumping over legs and\nnot treading on fingers. Filling a\nlecture theatre to such over-capacity\nis dangerous and illegal, but on\ntransport, it\u2019s seen as business as\nusual. Charging for a fast journey\nis something I can understand, but\ncharging an eyewatering amount for\novercrowding is despicable.\nMy friend who lives in Stoke can\ntake the same train as me, or a quiet,\ncheap one that takes a little longer. I\nhave no such choice: the Manchester\nto London journey, like so many other\ncommuter routes, is monopolised by\na single company.

    "content": "23\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 31 JAN\nARTS\nAMAZING, IN CAPITAL LETTERS\nA\ns I sat down in my plush\ntheatre seat, tucking my\nkiddy school bag under\nmy legs, I suddenly felt\nvery small. Everything\nabout the evening ahead of me\nseemed designed to dwarf me: the\ncavernous Olivier theatre, the word\nfamous director Sam Mendes of\nAmerican Beauty fame, the BAFTA\nwinning Simon Russell Beale in the\nmain role and, of course, the play\nitself- King Lear. More than 400 years\nold, it has been performed in all the\nmajor theatres on the globe and has\nbeen interpreted by the greatest\nactors in Britain, both on stage and\non screen.\nSo it was with trepidation that I\nleant back in my seat for the three\nhour performance. And, almost\nimmediately, I forgot my qualms as I\nbecame enveloped in a complex, dark\nand captivating world.\nFor those of you who are struggling\nto remember which of the many\nShakespeare plays King Lear is let me\ngive you a quick lowdown. Lear, King\nof Britain, is getting old so decides to\ndivide his kingdom between his three\ndaughters based on how much they\nlove him.\nThe eldest two (think Ugly Sisters\nfrom Cinderella) start proclaiming\ntheir love, while Cordelia, the\nyoungest, answers honestly but with\nno exaggerations, stating that she\nloves him as a daughter. Lear gets\nangry, disowns Cordelia and send\nher off, penniless, to marry the king\nof France. The Ugly Sisters pop\noff to enjoy their new kingdoms,\nrefusing to host their dad and all his\nrowdy knights. Lear\u2019s slightly losing\nthe plot by now so he strops around\nhaving fights with everyone and\nends up falling out with all three of\nhis daughters and many of his close\nfriends. Not good. Add to this a side-plot of the Earl of Gloucester being\ntricked into disowning his son on\nthe advice of his illegitimate son and\nyou\u2019ve got quite a lot to be going on\nwith.\nThe beauty of this production is\nthat at no point you\u2019ll be scratching\nyour head wondering who\u2019s who and\nwhat is actually happening. Mendes\nhas created a seamless production- a\nperfect production. The stage set is\nminimal but effective, creating a dark\nworld which gradually disintegrates\nunder civil and international war.\nPlaying on the strong 20th century\nimagery of refugees and military\ndictatorships, stage designer Anthony\nWard uses the vast Olivier theatre\nto its full potential, with groups\nof soldiers and civilians tramping\naround wearily with suitcase and\nsleeping bags throughout the\nperformance, helicopters and military\nplanes roaring overhead.\nThe cast is amazing. Am I allowed to\nuse capitals for that? It\u2019s AMAZING.\nIt\u2019s so rare to see a cast in which every\nsingle character is strong and real\nand doesn\u2019t over dominate the stage.\nRussell Beale is an outstanding Lear:\ndespotic in his military, unpredictable\nmanner but touching in his self-aware\nageing. He creates a Lear that we can\nall relate to, the dementia ridden old\nman, refusing to give in to his age.\nBut Mendes again works his\nmagic by making this production a\nsnapshot of life, rather than a play\nabout a man. You will witness the\nunravelling of a State, a court and\na family, with the effects this has on\nevery person involved. And in the\nthree hours betrayal, madness, age,\nloss, poverty and homelessness will\ndominate the stage, with faithfulness,\nfilial love and forgiveness fleetingly\ncounterbalancing the scenes.\nFrom its origins, this is what theatre\nhas been all about. Bringing life, a\nlife you cannot or might not want to\nexperience, to a place where you can\ndo so fleetingly - the stage.\nHere you\u2019ll experience a dark, war-revenged, gory world full of death\nand betrayal but you will experience\nit so incredibly vividly that as you\nmake your way along the South Bank\non leaving the theatre you\u2019ll blink,\namazed, at the happy, shiny London\nthat meets your eyes.\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\nWhat: King Lear\nWhere: National Theatre, SE1\nWhen: 23rd January to 28th May\nPrice: Various\nMARK DOUET\nRussel Tovey shines in The Pass\nChristopher Hong\nWriter\nWhat: The Pass\nWhere: Royal Court, SW1\nWhen: 13th January - 5th March\nPrice: \u00a320, \u00a310 Mondays\nW\nith the latest\nrevelation from\nThomas Hitzlsperger, and Tom\nDaley\u2019s recent\nannouncement that he is in a gay re-lationship, the topic of high profile\nsportsman and homosexuality is currently much discussed. This new play\nby John Donnelly is set over a 12 year\nperiod of a professional footballer\nJason\u2019s career. It begins on the evening before his first appearance for the\nteam, sharing a hotel room with a fellow debutant and friend Ade. Their\nrelationship is perhaps something\nmore than just friends and team-mates. A few years later, at the height\nof Jason\u2019s footballing fame and suc-cess, he spends an evening with a table dancer in a hotel room with dubious intentions. In the final act, Jason\ninvites Ade to catch up in his hotel\nroom where he is living, having separated from his wife. By then, his star\nhas waned and he is battling with\ninjuries, looking for a club that will\ntake him for a final season or two.\nAt first instance, it can be seen as a\nplay about a gay footballer having to\nconform to a heterosexual footballer\nstereotype, ending up being dissatisfied about his life despite his footballing achievements. But the play\ncovers a wider scope and looks much\ndeeper at the role of money and suc-cess, especially how it enables one to\ncontrol and manipulate the media\nand those around.\nThe play explicitly draws on the example of Jimmy Savile as to the extent of the appalling behaviour which\nsome of the rich and famous get away\nwith. All these are handled in the\nplay with great skill, mixing subtle\nlook and gesture with overt excess\nin confrontations and debauchery.\nAlthough the writing occasionally\nwanders and becomes distracted\nwith details, it soon snaps back to its\ncore message and story.\nThe direction by John Tiffany incorporates his usual choreographed\nscene changes performed to music\nwith a heavy beat. The arrangement\nof the audience on the opposite sides\nof the central stage alludes to a football stadium, and provides some\ninteresting possibilities for the audience to choose their focus when\nperformers are on either end.\nThe choice is not always an easy\none with the excellent cast. Russell\nTovey is outstanding as Jason, managing to convince as the youngster\nfull of innocence and optimism in\nthe first scene. It is also played with\nsuggestions of thoughtfulness that\nenable him to transform believably\ninto this calculating and cold monster in the subsequent acts. Gary\nCarr\u2019s Ade is understated and mellows as years go by. Lisa McGrillis\nplays the WAG type dancer with a\nmix of strength and vulnerability\nand at the same time, holding onto\na degree of dignity. Nico Mirallegro\nstands-out playing the smaller role as\nthe off duty hotel worker Harry, joining in with Jason\u2019s excesses. Mirallegro\u2019s story of a stag party in Krakow\nis beautifully delivered.\nThis is a thoughtful look of modern\ncelebrity culture and observations on\nthe topical subject about machismo\nof sport. It is delivered with wit and\ncraft, with a good dose of danger and\ntension.\nMANUEL HARLAN\n\n"

    "content": "It has recently been announced that the College has set up a consultation process to review the \u201cresidential experience\u201d at Imperial, with the purpose of\nshaping the residential experience for students in College accommodation.\nHalls of residence and wardening must be some of the most reviewed areas of College life, with a frequency that almost mirrors that of senior management\nchanges. Even so, the purpose, timing and speed of this latest one seem rather alarming. You see, although one would expect that the purpose of any\nreview is to improve (or better, make recommendations for) what it is that gets reviewed, this one seems to differ. It aims \u2018to shape the residential\nexperience\u2019 but at the same time excluding from the process those who are at present instrumental in delivering it, this being as far as I can recall the first\nresidential review without a single warden on the panel. Announced days after the College\u2019s announcement for the new President (Professor Alice\nGast will succeed Sir Keith O\u2019Nions when he retires in September 2014, to lead the college\u2019s strategy, and as part of this to develop the new Imperial West\ncampus and the College\u2019s links to industry, philanthropists and alumni), the review is to be completed in time to be implemented for next year\u2019s academic\ncycle. The residential experience affects all aspects of student learning and its importance to any institution\u2019s strategy is well recognised; so what\u2019s the\nrush? and while there are so many questions in the air:\nWho are the wardens? What do they do? Why do we still have them? Do we really need them? and similarly:\nWhat are the halls of residence for? Do we need them? What is the college running them for? and so on\u2026\nHow I would describe what our halls and wardening aim to provide is simple: A HOME AWAY FROM HOME. At Imperial, students come from all over\nthe UK and overseas, some from small rural towns and villages, and can often find London and studying at Imperial hard to cope with. Most have left\ntheir homes for the first time; some are homesick and miss their families and friendship circles. Our halls at Imperial are living communities for first year\nundergraduates aiming to ease the transition from home to university, from living at home to living on their own.\nAny accommodation a University offers cannot by magic become a learning community. There is a clear need for systematic effort to facilitate the multi-cultural/multi-disciplinary nature of a hall of residence, with students residing together and supporting each other, resulting in a greater sense of connection\nto the place and to the University. Historically the provision of wardening has been central to this. This is a model that emphasises living arrangements\nwhere subwardens and seniors live under the same roof, under the guidance of the warden, a member of the academic staff who also resides there.\nAt Imperial, we do not believe that it is possible to draw an artificial distinction between academic and personal problems. Academic difficulties may\nlead students to display antisocial behaviours in the residence, or to become withdrawn; personal issues may have a deleterious effect on academic\nperformance. Because wardens and subwardens have all been through the university experience, they are able to reassure students that there are very\nfew problems which can\u2019t be solved if they are addressed soon enough, and that they themselves have probably experienced the same feelings of\nuncertainty and alienation, doubts about whether the course they are on is the right one for them, etc. A resident will often feel that s/he is the only person\nto suffer from a particular problem, and it can be a great relief to them to realise that this is far from the truth.\nIt is important that the warden or subwarden should not solve problems for the student, but should help them to discover how to do it themselves. Wardens\nand subwardens are required to have a comprehensive knowledge of the University\u2019s regulations and support services and, crucially, to understand and\nidentify the boundaries of their competence. They are not counsellors, doctors, chaplains, financial advisers, etc., but they know how to refer residents to\nthose who are. Because wardens and subwardens are outside the resident\u2019s academic line of authority, it is easier for him or her to approach them with\nany concerns. Confidential discussions may take place without the personal tutor or their department becoming involved; this may later be necessary, but\nfrequently issues can be resolved in an informal chat with the warden or subwarden.\nAt the same time, we are trying to create a situation in which students can form social connections \u2014 friendships, mentorships. We\u2019re trying to achieve a\ngood balance between learning to be independent and also learning to live with other people. Part of the experience of living in halls is not to smooth\nevery way for every student. The conflicts that are naturally going to arise around who left their dishes in the sink, or who is messy, who is neat, who is\nplaying music, and who wants to study \u2014 all of those kinds of things are part of the skills those students are learning.\nOf course, it\u2019s not all about problems! Most students thoroughly enjoy their first year in College, the only year that they are guaranteed a place in halls.\nTheory says that the first year shapes their overall University experience and is what drives their overall connection to it. Studying at Imperial, as with\nmany of the top Universities, comes with hard work, and people have to quickly reach a balance between their studies and the fun side of their \u2018freedom\u2019\naway from family and home. Our role on this is to encourage students to channel their energy and enthusiasm into activities that do not conflict with their\nstudies and which help them to relax, rest, make friends, and enhance their personal profiles as responsible young adults. All halls have hall committees;\nresidents stand for election to these and, with the assistance of wardens and subwardens, organize the social, cultural and sporting activities of the hall.\nThe election itself is a developmental experience, as students learn how to run the democratic process. The Committee ensures that activities are organised\nand amenities are managed in a way which reflects the wishes of all the residents of the hall. Annual dinners, trips abroad and parties in and outside the\nhall between other numerous diverse activities and events are organised\u2026 The committee also keeps an eye on the members of the hall, telling the warden\nor subwarden if anyone appears to be unhappy or unwell.\nAs wardens, we are here to facilitate a culture that aims to manage halls as lively communities rather than mere dormitories. Our overall aim is to work\ntogether with academic departments and College support to engage with students, merging their learning and residential experiences into a University\none that they are proud of. Needless to say Imperial is not alone in offering this, to the contrary, the value of wardening provision is widely recognised by\nmost Universities (all of the top ranking ones) as demonstrated by numerous benchmark surveys done by the College (the most recent ones in 2008 and\n2011). Why the concern, then? you might ask; why be alarmed with another review?\nIn the past half-century we have also observed a different trend in some universities, as the need to house higher numbers of students at lower cost led to the\nerosion of the traditional halls of residence. As they became more centralised and bureaucratic, the oversight of campus life within them had been largely\nhived off from the faculty to a class of full-time residence \u2018life managers\u2019. However well-intentioned these officials have been, because they are detached\nfrom the academic structure of the university, evidence shows they have not been able to create meaningful educational environments for students. Even\nmore noxiously, some universities have come to see campus residences as income-generating tools analogous to parking lots and vending machines. For\nmore than a generation these deep structural flaws have cheated students out of the most important thing a university can offer them: sustained contact\nwith their teachers in a rich and diverse educational environment.\nWith the danger of British education losing its appeal to international students, such systems are often heavily criticised for creating a real conflict\nparticularly with the image of UK education sold abroad. For a long time the UK has been able to rely on the reputation of British education to keep\napplications rolling in. But competition has been intense. North American and Australian universities, many of which have gone back to residential\nsystems, recruit aggressively throughout Asia, and in University rankings a strong performance from Asian countries has prompted warnings that the UK\u2019s\nglobal success is at risk without greater investment to see off such \u201cfierce competition\u201d.\nWe have also seen luxury dorms becoming very popular for a while \u2014 rooms tricked out with all the amenities, like double beds, private bathrooms with\nOpen Letter: Regarding the\nResidential Experience Review\nfull tubs, gyms in the hall, a trend in my view, created by private providers to increase their market share, pushing institutional provision away from their\nmonopolies and into areas of the market where they control the rules. On one side people say, \u2018Well, the students come from a home where they have\ntheir own room and their own bathroom and they have their own everything\u2019. On the other side, the real question is what we offer so that they choose\nto live in halls. Our job is, as a university, to make the living situation so attractive and such an important and integrated part of the college experience\nthat everybody is going to want (or want their child) to live on the campus, at least for a year. Institutions that turned halls into luxury hostels faced many\nproblems, particularly as they \u2018lost\u2019 students in their rooms, limiting the ways for the University to interact with them or to know what is happening there:\npeople may be having huge parties in their suite or else getting totally isolated in front of their PCs. That should have been educational common sense in\nadvance, particularly with reference to first year students, but when universities place marketing come-ons to students \u2014 \u201cwe give you what you want\u201d \u2014\nahead of educational objectives, it isn\u2019t surprising that the result is disappointing.\nIn this \u2018race to quality\u2019 it quickly became clear that student accommodation is more than that. Recognised as an important part of the educational process,\nthe last few years saw the return of wardening systems in both University and privately owned halls trying to challenge the non-monetary value of\ninstitutions\u2019 historic monopoly on providing pastoral care, support, security and sociability. The 2009-10 NUS/Unipol Costs Survey concluded that \u201cwhen\nuniversities enter into agreements with commercial operators to provide student housing, they should find it important (as many do already) to ensure that\nthe level of service and support students receive is in line with that provided by the institution\u201d. The ANUK Code for Educational Establishments (2008)\nsimilarly addresses the need to ensure that tenants clearly understand who is responsible for student care, with appropriate residential presence\nrequired in any residential development, which houses in excess of 150 students. Furthermore, the latest NUS/Unipol Accommodation Costs Survey (2013)\nis revealing in terms of the significant increases in the availability of student bed spaces in the UK being private sector-provided, increasing from 4% under\n10 years ago (in 2003) to 39 % (79% of the 18,607 bed spaces that came on line in 2013). In light of this, the report warns: \u201cIt would be easy for\ninstitutions to lose sight of what they are actually selling students in letting their own accommodation\u2026 If education institutions start to look like private\nsuppliers, they stand to lose at least some of the market advantage which has traditionally come from student perceptions of the security that attaches\nto renting directly from an education institution. If this happens, students will bypass the accommodation office and rent directly from a supplier. There is\nevidence that this is already happening ...\u201d\nThere has been one University that recently replaced wardens. In 2011, a team of 28 \u2018Resident Support\u2019 Staff (with no reference to \u2018pastoral care\u2019 or\n\u2018duty of care\u2019 in their job descriptions) replaced 82 wardens at the University of Southampton, with staffing costs, at \u00a3824,000 per year, similar to the\ncost of providing accommodation to the 82 wardens lost. All views were taken into account but did not determine the outcome of the decision (which was\nto be reviewed after two years). In the words of the director who took it, it was a decision \u201cnot based on a democratic vote in the RSS nor by University\nwide consensus\u201d but was \u201can informed business decision\u201d.\nThis raises another serious implication when Universities shape the residential experience. Looking at the provision of student services at different Universities,\ninstitutional choices in treating students as customers or learners play a significant role in how students \u2018realise\u2019 the educational, residential and overall\nuniversity experience. While we might argue that students are both customers and learners, the dividing line between the two has become dangerously\nblurred. Since the introduction of the \u2018Blue Cube\u2019 as a concept, a building and a management structure at Imperial, many share the view that it feels as if\nthe Faculty has passed all power to central administration, and although this could have worked, the dichotomy created with the introduction of the Hub\nblurred even more the lines of decision making between College administration and Campus Services.\nAs a current subwarden and ex-president of the Union said earlier this year in his letter to the Rector, in reference to the changes in cleaning offered in\nhalls \u2018Whilst the central administration might not see students as cash-cows, the Commercial Services certainly do (re-branding to\n\u2018Campus Services\u2019 fools no-one \u2013 the whole ethos of the department, not just the name, needs to change before any noticeable effect\nis felt)\u2019. Strong words coming from students, but really not much of a reaction from us. In my view, there is going to be a point where a University really\nmust decide whether it is just another service provider or a community of scholars, and I think we have reached the point where we need to make that\nchoice now. University experience and student satisfaction are not the same. Student satisfaction is of compelling interest to universities as they seek to\ncontinually improve the learning environment for students, meet the expectations of their constituent groups and legislative bodies, and demonstrate their\ninstitutional effectiveness, but unlike service industries, which hold satisfaction as a goal in and of itself, universities typically perceive satisfaction as a\nmeans to an end. Higher education tends to care about student satisfaction because of its potential impact on student motivation, retention, recruitment\nefforts, and fundraising.\nOn top of the above, one has to consider how Imperial, an international university which provides rigorous, intensive, and research-led degree courses in\nscience, engineering, medicine and business, located in London, with one of the largest estates of any higher education institution in the UK, is different in\nmany respects from other Universities. For example, there is much rhetoric about the link between research and education. Indeed, at Imperial we believe\nit is essential to encompass and excel in both. However, there are might be many fine teaching-only institutions that offer students an excellent education,\nbut the fact that an institution produces world-class research does not mean that its pedagogy will be research-led: peer interaction is critical, and the\nenvironment in which students learn important. Here, a residential experience has most to offer. Education does not stop at the end of a lecture or tutorial:\nit continues through debate with one\u2019s peers or students of different disciplines socialising in the hall. This is one of our halls\u2019 unsung but great strengths.\nAgain, if one looks at the institutions that regularly top the world rankings, they all have similar attributes: high-quality research, outstanding students (like\nours) and a residential experience that enhances both research and education. Although other types can do well in the rankings, the evidence suggests\nthat they do not make it to the very top.\nWith the recent development of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in higher education, and the prospect that technology could fundamentally\nchange how education is delivered, it is even more critical to understand the link between the residential experience and the academic one. We might\nstill be a long way from being able to train students to be scientists and scholars by online instruction, but the scalability and economic efficiency of online\neducation is already causing a paradigm shift, with a new kind of mission for top universities. The leaders of Harvard and MIT that founded edX were\nquick to review implications to the residential experience in the future. After the launch of edX, the presidents of both Harvard and MIT emphasized that\ntheir focus would remain on the traditional residential experience. \u201cOnline education is not an enemy of residential education\u201d, said MIT president Susan\nHockfield. Yet this statement doesn\u2019t hold true for most less-wealthy or middle range universities. At institutions like Harvard, large investments are under\nway not only to create the online courses of the future but also to renew the College\u2019s residential Houses as places for students to live, interact, and learn.\nThe recently renovated Quincy building, which now houses about 180 students, has two new elevators and internal corridors connected horizontally\ncreating a new way for resident tutors to relate to their student neighbours and advisees, and for students to interact with each other. With several kitchen-equipped suites in the building for resident tutors; the vision for many improvements was to bring core academic activities into the House: its state-of-the-art smart classroom was championed by Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, member of the HarvardX leadership committee and\nmember of the board of directors of edX.\nWhether the predictions of how education will look in the future prove right, nobody knows. The only way to predict the future is to have the power to\nshape it. In that respect, I hope that the on-going review will open rather than close the doors to the necessary discussion we need to be engaging in now.\nImperial has a great history of residential experience and urgently needs to have its accommodation provision realigned with its academic mission. The\nreview process could start by understanding who we are before deciding what we can be. The potential for Imperial to place itself amongst those top\nUniversities that will lead the future, is here, and it\u2019s the choices we make now that will determine if we will be able to reach it. Shaping the residential\nexperience for the College is critical. Everyone should engage in this discussion. As long as decisions are not being taken for us, and we are all involved\nin the process, we should be able to shape our future and have nothing to fear.\n*Dr Nick Voulvoulis is the Warden of Southwell & Bernard Sunley Hall, and Reader in Environmental Technology at the Centre for Environmental Policy.

Mr\nFogarty, who has never held a driving\nlicense, was clocked at speeds of up\n170km/h (105mph). The ground pursuit was eventually called off to reduce\ndanger to the public. However, a police\nhelicopter observed the car running a\nred light on Orrong Road and hitting\nthe taxi.

Katniss\n(J Law) is still traumatized from her\nexperiences in the arena and rightly\nso, as she was both forced to kill and\nto watch as friends died in her arms.\nBefore she has any time to reflect\nand properly grieve, she\u2019s whisked\noff with fake bf Peeta on a victory\ntour of the other districts to spout\nCapitol propaganda in order to quell\nthe growing insurrection against the\nbrutal, autocratic government of\nPresident Snow.

It is turning out to be\none of the more financially successful\ncontemporary war films, after the less\nthan stellar efforts of The Kingdom,\nThe Hurt Locker, Rendition, In the Valley of Elah, The Messenger amongst\nothers.\nLone Survivor has a broad range of\nappeal. It is an intense, action-packed\nvehicle that goes above and beyond,\ngiving its audience a lot more than the\nexpected material. The set-up is sim-ple: after a montage of United States\nNavy SEALs being put through all\nsorts of tough, gruelling army training\nto be turned into the toughest fight-ers, we see four SEALs embarking on\na recon mission to capture and kill a\nnotoriously violent Taliban leader.\nThere is a fair amount of build-up\nbefore the four are dropped into the\nAfghan wilderness. Marcus Luttrell\n(Mark Wahlberg), Michael Murphy\n(Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile\nHirsch), and Matthew Axelson (Ben\nFoster) clearly share a tight bond and\neven within the relatively brief scenes\ndesignated to develop each character,\nthe writing ensures that they all stand\nout within the group, all of them with\ntheir own individual strengths to contribute to the unit as a whole.\nTheir mission should have been a\nsimple one, and yet a chance encounter threatens to unravel the entire op-eration. The unit encounters harmless\ngoat herders from the village where\ntheir target is hiding out. Do they kill\nthese unarmed civilians to not jeop-ardise their mission? Do they let them\nall go in accordance to the Rules of\nEngagement and morality in combat?\nThere is intense debate between the\nfour of them, as there no doubt would\nbe some heated argument amongst\naudience members too, but in the end\nthe prisoners are set free, which triggers deadly consequences.\nWith the Taliban alerted, the four\nhave no choice but to retreat and call\nfor back-up. But military support is\nvirtually impossible when their communications equipment fails to work\nin the harsh, wild terrains. Ultimately\nthey are left to fend for themselves;\nheavily outnumbered and disadvan-taged, about to face the never-ending,\nrelentless action scenes of hardcore,\nadrenaline-fuelled combat.\nIt starts off simply and swimmingly\nenough for the Americans, with their\nhigh-tech weapons loaded and picking off one bad guy at a time, but\nsoon they are forced to take cover and\nstart jumping into rocks and valleys\nto escape the incoming hail of bul-lets. Every loud horrific thud, crush,\ncrunch and bang plays a huge part in\nportraying an intimate, horrendously\nrealistic, tense, continuous scene of\nunflinching bloody, gore-filled action\nthat never holds back.\nWhen people are shot, we see the\nwounds. There is a lot of blood, torn\nflesh, and even some sustained looks\nat the injuries too. When there are\nbroken bones, they stick out and cause\nimmense pain. There is nothing neat\nor slick about how the action devel-ops, and the film is all the better for it.\nAs the title suggests, there are\ndeaths, a lot of them dragged out and\ngiven the slow-motion treatment to\nbring out the tragedy. Possibly the\nonly moments where the film slows\ndown, they provide much-needed\nbreathing space from the fierce, unyielding shoot-outs.\nIs the film pro-American? Why not.\nBut the film tries its hardest to hold\nback on that. It\u2019s not an unbiased film\nby any means, but it at least steers\nclear from overly glorified heroism.\nPro-military? Sure. But it\u2019s more than\nthat. It\u2019s pro-humanity. Pro-camaraderie and brotherhood. These men were\nbrothers in arms, they were trained to\nnever give up under any circumstances and yes it does sound corny, but\ngiven the time we have spent with the\nsoldiers over the past couple of hours,\nthe personal angle the film strives to\nachieve is not only commendable but\nhighly worthwhile.\nPerformance-wise, the four men are\noutstanding. Particularly impressive\nis Foster who, covered in all sorts of\ncuts, bruises and wounds, brings out\nmore energy and ferocity as the film\ncarries on.\nIt\u2019s incredibly well-structured, and\nfrom start to finish by focussing on\nthe tough challenges these men face,\nthere is an enormous sense of authentic excitement that lasts the whole way\nthrough.\n\n"

Protests\nwere bolstered by the involvement\nof youth and there was a unanimous\ndemand for transfer of power. Today,\nin 2014 young secular Eqyptians\nvoicing opinions against the military\nare languishing in jails at the mercy\nof a coup which once enjoyed their\noutright support.\nOn August 2012, When President\nMohammed Morsi appointed\nGen Sisi as general commander of\nEgypt\u2019s armed forces and defence\nminister; it was seen as an attempt\nto reclaim political power from the\nmilitary, which had seized control\nafter President Hosni Mubarak was\nousted. However, Gen Sisi publicly\nwarned Mr Morsi of another army\nintervention if the government failed\nto respond to \u201cthe will of the people.\u201d\nFollowing on from that date, Mr Morsi\nof the Muslim Brotherhood assumed\npower as the head of state until its\nfirst anniversary marked with show of\nextreme discontentment by different\nfactions of the society. This time round\nthe army issued an ultimatum to Mr\nMorsi, instructing him to respond to\npeople\u2019s demands or step down within\n48 hours. When he failed to do so, it\nremoved him from power and placed\nhim under house arrest. The army\nappointed an interim civilian leader\nin Gen Sisi and issued a roadmap\nleading to fresh elections. This was\nviewed by anti-Morsi protesters as the\nsaviour of democracy, rather than the\nperpetrators of a coup.\nIt was announced that Mr Morsi and\nmore than 30 others in the Muslim\nBrotherhood\u2019s leadership were to\nstand trial for \u201cconspiring with foreign\norganisations to commit terrorist\nacts\u201d, with prosecutors alleging that\nMr Morsi formed an alliance with the\nPalestinian militant group Hamas and\nLebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. Mr Morsi is also\nfacing fraud charges in connection\nwith the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s\neconomic and social programme for\nEgypt\u2019s recovery, called Renaissance\n(al-Nahda). Separately, Mr Morsi\nis facing a third trial relating into\nhis escape from jail during the 2011\nuprising against former President\nHosni Mubarak\nThe military intervention was not\nwell received by many who had to\nbear the brunt of their atrocities in\nthe turbulent period following Mr\nMubarak\u2019s ouster. Women were\nsubjected to brutal virginity tests\nunder false claims of safety measures.\nIn order to appease the masses Gen\nSisi released statements stressing\nthe importance of ensuring social\nequality.\nOn 3 July, Gen al-Sisi, known to\nenjoy \u201cstrong ties with US officials on\nboth diplomatic and military levels\u201d,\nsuspended Egypt\u2019s constitution and\ncalled for new elections. He was\nbacked by liberal opposition forces\nand the main religious leaders.\nKnown to be a religious man, Gen\nSisi has enjoyed perpetual support\nfrom religious bodies across the\nnation. Mr ElBaradei, a former Morsi\nloyalist and coordinator of the main\nalliance of liberal parties known as\nthe National Salvation Front, was\nappointed interim vice-president with\nresponsibility for foreign affairs as a\nmeans to win his consent. Tamarod, a\nnew group that organised nationwide\nprotests against Mr. Morsi, gave the\npresident an ultimatum to resign or\nface an open-ended campaign of civil\ndisobedience and it was also backed\nby the army.\nUnder the military\u2019s pressure a\nreferendum was held on January 14th,\n2014 to draft a new constitution and\npave the way for another general\nelection. The terms of the new\nconstitution provide for a President\nto be elected for a maximum of 2\nterms of four years each. The defence\nminister, however, would continue to\nbe from the military.\nA respectable 38% turnout at the\nreferendum was a tell-tale sign of\npeople\u2019s disgruntlement with constant\nviolence and instability in their\ncountry.Egypt\u2019swearypublicisfearful,\nhaving learned through three years of\nturmoil how protests can evolve into\nweeks-long cycles of violence. Clearly,\nthe participants in the referendum\nmainly included Gen Sisi\u2019s supporters.\nWhile Morsi\u2019s supporters boycotted\nit, a large proportion of the country\u2019s\nyouth refrained from voting as well.\nSuch discrepancies reflect not only the\nhardening of a dangerous polarization\nbetween Islamists and their foes, but\nwidespread dissatisfaction among\nEgypt\u2019s youth. Harsh prison sentences\nhave recently been served on youths\nfor such crimes as illegal assembly\nand vandalism. Prosecutors recently\nslapped travel bans on a score of\npeople, pending charges against them\nfor \u201cinsulting the judiciary\u201d. A number\nof journalists remain in prison\nunder vague charges of \u201cfalsifying\ninformation\u201d and news channels that\nbroadcast a different point of view\nfrom the military coups\u2019 are banned.\nAll steps are taken to keep the once\nelected President from garnering\nthe support of his countrymen or\neven the ability to explain his stance\nand in return question his people\u2019s\nimpressionable minds.\nEgypt\u2019s New Constitution\nJash Rughani\nPolitics Editor\nThe metamorphosis of an Arab state from autocracy to anarchy\nepithinktank\nCare Data: Live saving tool or\ninvasion of privacy?\nT\nhe NHS has recently\ndispatched a leaflet titled\n\u201cBetter information means\nbetter care\u201d to everyone\nin England.

The database is hoped to achieve\nbetter patient care and efficiency, but\na recent risk assessment published\nby NHS England shows that Patients\n\u201cmay lose trust\u201d in the confidential\nnature of the health service.\nThe risk assessment claims if the\ncare data scheme is to go ahead\nthen this runs the risk of damaging\npatient trust in the NHS and making\ninformation vulnerable to hacking.\nThere is also a \u201csmall residual risk\u201d\nthat patients will be re-identified.\nThe assessment states that these\nrisks can be mitigated by allowing\npatients to opt out by contacting their\nGP. The risk assessment concludes\nthat the benefits outweigh the risk.\nThe care data initiative will support\neconomic growth by turning the UK\ninto a \u201cglobal centre for life sciences\nand health research\u201d and creating a\n\u201cvibrant App marketplace.\u201d\n\u201cThe most valuable thing we have\nin health and social care is data,\u201d said\nexecutive medical director of the\nNHS Information Centre for health\nand social care, Dr Mark Davies, at\nthe healthcare efficiency through\ntechnology conference in October.\nSupporters of care data insist that\nthis kind of technology is essential\nin order to provide an excellent\nstandard of healthcare. Large volumes\nof health records can transform the\nway in which diseases are treated and\nmanaged. This is hoped to ultimately\nsave lives because it will allow\nresearchers to track the impact of\ndrugs and surgery on patients.\nPrivacy experts warn the trouble\nlies with the data being sold off to\ndrug and insurance companies, with\npatients not being able to tell who has\ntheir medical records or to what use\ntheir data will be put. Organisations\ncan apply to the new Health and Social\nCare Information Centre (HSCIC)\nto gain access to the database and\nif an application is approved then\nthe organisation will have to pay to\naccess the data. A process known as\n\u201cpseudonymisation\u201d occurs where\nsome personal identifiers will be\nremoved, but not enough to make the\ninformation completely anonymous.\nThe English database of medical\ndata will also include NHS numbers,\ndate of birth, postcode, ethnicity and\ngender. Critics fear that this data can\nbe pieced together with insurers,\npharmaceutical groups and other\nhealth sector companies own medical\ndata, essentially re-identifying certain\npatients.\nA Pulse survey conducted last week\nwith nearly 400 GP respondents\nfound a deep divide between those\nwho support the care data scheme\nand those who don\u2019t, with 41% saying\nthey intend to opt-out, 43% saying\nthey would not opt-out and 16%\nundecided.\nAamna Mohdin\nNews Editor\nGuardian\n\n"

Poor plotting, tired characters\nand woeful dialogue still continue to\nplague the medium. However, there have\nalways been a small number of creators \u2013\nsuch as Alan Moore, Warren Ellis and Neil\nGaiman \u2013 who have been held in much\nhigher regard than their compatriots and\nwho have managed to elevate the medium\ninto a respectable art from. Of these, I\nhave always admired Gaiman the most.\nThis is partly due to his versatility \u2013 as well\nas working on comics he is an acclaimed\nnovelist and screenwriter \u2013 but mainly the\nbecause of his amazing writing talent. This\ntalent is on fine display in one his earliest\nand most enduringly popular works, The\nSandman series.\nNominally set in the standard DC uni-verse, The Sandman graphic novels expand\nits mythology by creating the Endless \u2013 immortal anthropomorphic personifications\nof the seven basic driving forces of life and\nthe universe. These are Destiny, Death,\nDestruction, Despair, Desire, Delirium\nand our protagonist, Dream, also known\nas Morpheus. The story begins with our\nprotagonist captured by human magician\nRoderick Burgess. The first sections of the\nstory deal with Morpheus\u2019 eventual escape\nand the consequences the consequences of\nthe imprisonment of the Lord of Dreams\non the universe. As the story progresses,\nhowever, Gaiman gets the chance to explore the world of The Sandman further.\nWorld building is one of Gaiman\u2019s great\nstrengths. As in several of his other works\nhe draws heavy inspiration from many different mythologies and cultural traditions.\nHe takes great pleasure in mashing together ideas as diverse as Judeo-Christian\nmysticism, Egyptian mythology and English folklore. This is a world in which different divine pantheons compete for worshippers and fairies coexist with ancient\nGreek witches and eastern djins and ifrits.\nBuilding on an existing foundation allows\nGaiman\u2019s creation to be far deeper than\nwould otherwise have been possible and\nthe combination of the various disparate\nelements gives lends it colour and a bizarre\nuniqueness.\nOne might think that, with so many\ncompeting influences, the result might\nbe big mess. However, this is certainly\nnot the case here. Morpheus is the Lord\nof Dreams, and therefore also the Lord of\nStories. On a certain level the entire series\nis an exploration of humanity\u2019s fascination\nwith stories. It therefore seems natural\nthat to explore such a wide range of ideas.\nThe main reason, however, why all of this\nworks, is that Gaiman is such a brilliant\nwriter. He skilfully juggles multiple plots\nand \u2013 thanks to his crisp, witty dialogue\nand complex characters \u2013 manages to make\nevery one of them individually interesting.\nWhile many of these plots initially start out\ndisconnected, Gaiman\u2019s great achievement\nis eventually drawing them all together in a\nway that provides a satisfactory resolution\nto all of them. I won\u2019t spoil the ending but\nI will say that its focuses centrally on the\ncharacters of the Endless.

I must admit that I was initially drawn to the magazine itself\nas merely an object: the style integrates beauty and\nsimplicity and\u2026 oh the paper! Yes, the design would\nalmost make up for boring, commonplace pieces.\nNot that it needs to.\nThe first piece in the first copy I picked up was preceded by a black-and-white photograph of a man,\ndead in the snow, with arms outstretched and hat lying several feet away from him. The semi-fictional\naccount that followed, on the death-moments of the\nwriter Robert Walser interspersed with thoughts\nabout hats on heads that would soon be rolling, was\nwritten with a tenderness and pathos that stayed with\nme as little twenty-first century fiction had before.\nI have since read in The White Review many insight-ful, searching interviews that go beyond the scope\nof what one might find in newspapers or even in the\nslew of \u2018pretty\u2019, modern magazines.

That\nis a huge change. Universities were\nunderfunded then and are probably\nunderfunded now, but the amounts\nof money involved were much smaller\nthen than now. Having said that, I\nthink you have to make sure that the\nability of students to fund their way\nthrough and the terms of which the\nstudent loans are made are sufficiently,\nin banking jargon, \u2018soft\u2019 \u2013 that they are\naffordable and aren\u2019t something that\nis going to make people who should\ngo to University feel they can\u2019t afford\nto for financial reasons. So I think\nthere is a balance to be drawn. I\u2019m\nnot sure that the balance we have at\nthe moment is right, but there is a\nnecessity to make sure that people do\npay for their education a bit more than\nthey did just purely on the numbers\ngoing into education.\nAM: It is becoming increasingly\ndifficult for young people to get\nonto the housing market, let alone\nthe fact that students in London\ndon\u2019t have access to student housing\nthat students in at other institutions\nhave. What are your views on this\nissue?\nMC: I think housing in London is in\ncrisis, and I think it is not just confined\nto students \u2013 it\u2019s confined to anybody\nwho isn\u2019t extremely rich or qualified\nfor social housing. We desperately\nneed to build housing in London, we\nneed to rethink densities, and we need\nto rethink the use of brownfield sites.\nSo there is a general problem. There is\na lot to be said for building upwards,\nwhich comes down to density. Our\ndensity ratios, which for all the right\nreasons we\u2019ve wanted to keep low\ndensities, are unsustainable and that\nhas to change. I think Boris Johnson\nhas said effectively the same thing,\nand I think that is probably right.\nStudents are a particular problem, and\nit was as bad, I can tell you, when I was\nat Imperial because we had very little\nstudent housing at Imperial. There was\nBeit Hall, which has been there a long\ntime, and there was the old Southside\nbuilding, Southside Hall, and apart\nfrom that there was very little student\naccommodation. Imperial went out\nand bought a few houses in Earls\nCourt when I was there, but it was all\npretty basic, there is more now than\nthere was then.\nIt is real problem, and there has been\na lot of money put in, there has been a\nlot of effort into getting private money\nto finance student housing, which I\nthink Imperial has built some halls of\nresidence with that, but it isn\u2019t an easy\none to solve in London. Some of it is\nin North Acton I hear \u2026 which is not\nclever \u2026 It is all part of, dare I say it,\nthe housing crisis in London which no\nGovernment has successfully tackled.\nI think the Mayor is making the right\nnoises, but I think the problem is that\nit is hugely difficult, which is why\nnobody has come up with a solution\nto it. It does mean major changes to\nplanning laws, to be then accepted by\nlocal authorities, because planning\nis one of those things which central\nGovernment puts the framework in\nand local Government puts the details\nin. And then, you are up against people\nwho say, well I quite like my part of\ntown not \u201cbeing full of high-rise blocks\nand not being high density\u201d. If you go\nto other cities though, Paris is much\nmore densely developed and so is New\nYork, just to take two examples.\nAM: Naturally this wouldn\u2019t\nbe a complete interview with a\nConservative if I didn\u2019t mention\nEurope, especially given that\nthe media attention to the EU\nReferendum Bill \u2026\nMC: ...I think we need to start getting\nthat right. I think we face a real\nchallenge in getting allies in Europe\nand if we can\u2019t find allies for change\nin Europe, we will probably need to\ntake some tough decisions. They will\nbe forced on us in any case, regardless\nof what we want to do, by the clear\ndetermination to persist the Euro in\nthe other counties. There is only one\nfuture for the Euro \u2026 actually there\nare two: one is that it collapses, which\npolitically they are not allowed to\ndo, the other one is that it becomes\neffectively another State and we will\nbe outside it because we are not going\nto join the Euro.\nI think that if we can negotiate\nsensible terms to be outside the Euro,\nbut inside what would be effectively\nthe free trade element of Europe,\nthat would be the best solution. Free\nmovement of people is very difficult,\nbecause the people we want to stop\nhaving free movement are the people\nwho are the people going to come\nand not contribute to the country. If\nwe have got people who are coming\nin who are highly skilled, we want to\nbring them in. So you have got to get\nthe right balance. I\u2019m not sure that\nbringing in even lots of skilled Polish\nbuilders was terribly good for British\nbuilders and I think it is a real shame\nfor them.\nAM: Why did you decide to accept\na Peerage?\nMC: I decided to accept because\nwhen you are offered something like\nthis you don\u2019t refuse. Being a political\nanimal, just getting back onto the\nfront lines of politics, or close to it was\nreason enough. Why was I offered it?\nI think a variety of reasons, although\nthe short answer is I don\u2019t know! They\ndon\u2019t tell you why you are going in.\nYou don\u2019t get a citation which says\n\u201cDear Mr Carrington, we would like\nto join the House of Lords for the\nfollowing six good reasons \u2026\u201d. I would\nguess the reason include having been a\nMember of Parliament, I\u2019ve been also\nbeen very active in the voluntary part\nof the political party, been London\nregional Chairman and I am currently\nan Association Chairman. I\u2019ve also\ndone a lot of other things, for example\nI chair the Party\u2019s appeal board. So,\nI guess it\u2019s a combination of those\nthings. And of course because I\u2019m a\nbrilliant chap and they love me to bits!\nAM: Well naturally! Finally, why\nshould the students of today care\nabout politics and why should it\nbe Conservative politics, given the\ntraditional student image of it being\nfull of old boys, big business, rather\nsocially dispassionate and uncaring.\nMC: That often is the view. It comes\ndown to, what is certainly is one of\nthe driving forces of the Conservative\nParty, although sometimes we lose\nsight of it, is that the only way of\npaying for all the support we want\nto give to people who are less able\nto look after themselves is to have a\nvery strong economy. The only way\nto have a very strong economy is to\nhave a free economy. The difference\nbetween the parties always used to be\nbetween central planning and private\nenterprise \u2013 people having the right\nto succeed and the right to fail in the\nbusinesses. The 50 years after the war,\nI think, proved pretty conclusively that\ncentral planning doesn\u2019t work. We\nare now getting back to an economy\nwhere we are seeing businesses able\nto grow and being rewarded for their\nefforts, people being able to pay to tax\nwhich allows us to finance the things\nwe need to finance.\nStudents should get involved because\nall of you are going to be working, all of\nyou are going are going to have a stake\nin this country or the country you\ncome from or are going back to, and\nI would hope that you are going to be\npassionate about making this country,\nor indeed any country, better for your\nchildren than it was for your parents.\nThe only way you are going to be able\nto do that is by making sure that you\nare driving that change and stopping\nother people driving the change in the\nwrong direction.\nAM: Lord Carrington, thank you\nvery much.\nMC: Pleasure.\nF\nollowing the success of the\nfirst TEDxImperialCollege\nconference held at Imperial\nCollege two years ago, and\nTEDMEDLive last March,\nstudents from Imperial can now\nlook forward to yet another thought-provoking, mind-engaging TEDx\nconference to be held on 29 March.\nTED conferences rose to fame\nglobally by spreading innovative and\ninspirational ideas. TEDx events are\norganised independently but adhere\nto the TED format, and are licensed by\nthe organisation in the spirit of their\nmission Ideas Worth Spreading.\nThis TEDxImperialCollege conference promises something more futuristic and forward looking than the\nfirst TEDxImperialCollege which was\ncentred around the theme the Great\nExhibition. With the bold theme \u2018One\nStep Ahead\u2019, you can expect this to be\na conference filled with the great ideas\nof tomorrow. This conference promises to explore ideas that are breaking\nnew ground and revolutionising the\nhuman experience.\nTEDxImperialCollege 2014 will be\nmoving back to campus after last year\u2019s\nTEDMEDLive popped across the road\nto the Royal Geographic society to\nentertain and inspire 450 Imperial\nstudents and staff. This time, however,\nthe event has been moved from\nthe Great Hall, the venue of 2012\u2032s\nrunaway success, to the Business\nSchool. This means attendees will\nhave to secure places more quickly\nthan ever as the new venue is smaller\nand there will only be approximately\none hundred tickets going on sale this\ntime round.\nTicket details haven\u2019t be announced\njust yet, but if previous years of TEDx\nand TEDMEDLive at Imperial are\nanything to go by, they\u2019ll be some of\nthe hottest tickets in town.\nIn the coming weeks, the full list\nof hand-picked speakers will be\nreleased and Felix will report on\nthese announcements as they are\nmade. You will find updates as well\non the website and social media\npages. A lot of excitement is building\nup as the countdown towards the\nnext TEDxImperialCollege begins.\nAnd indeed, to become part of\nTEDxImperialCollege and all\nthe exciting ideas that define our\ntomorrow, be sure to keep an eye on\nthe TEDxImperialCollege website at\ntedximperialcollege.co.uk\nTEDxImperialCollege is also\non Facebook (facebook.com/\ntedximperialcollege) and you can\nfollow TEDxImperialCollege on\ntwitter @TEDxIC.\nChen Yann Qi\nTEDxIC Organising Team\ntedximperialcollege\nIntroducing TEDxImperialCollege 2014\nterry Moore, Parliamentary copyright images are reproduced with the permission of Parliament\n\n"
