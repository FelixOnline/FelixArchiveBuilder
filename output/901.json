    "content": "9\nFELIX\nThe people, films and books taking part in the largest Humanist conference ever.\nBlasphemy, Reag\nDecade of ^ of Women FELIX\nGreed\n\u2022 i5'I have become an apathetic cynic. My\nintellectual exercise is that of finding the\nright button on the remote control to see\nKilroy lean with sympathy. It was not\nalways like this. I marched at Barrow and\nfelt the tarmac along with thousands of\nothers as we 'died in'. I was a young\nrevolutionary. How arrogantly sick are\nthose who tut tut and tell the young they\nwill grow out of their dissent. Well there is\nan antidote.\nBarbara Ehrenreich makes me mad. She\nwrites like I would like to think. Her new\nbook 'The Worst Years of Our LivesIrreverent Notes from a Decade of Greed',\npublished on 25th April, examines the\nvalues and issues in the Reagan years.\nThis book should be stripped of its cover\nand sent to every bigot in this country. The\ncover being glued to placards, or billboards,\nor windows - any public place will do.\nThere is no better way to change society.\nEven if we fail we will have challenged,\nand they will have been forced to see the\njoke - themselves. Of course it is too easy,\nand arrogant, to think of them and us, one\nreason for reading it before sending it to\nyour favourite piss head. Barbara converts social comment into\nlines that destroy their target with every\nwry smile and laugh. Who said women\nrights, gay rights, the politics of justice\nwere dead and boring? This series of short\nessays puts boredom where it belongs, with\nthose who do not care and make a crude\njoke about it. Read it, laugh and enjoy\nrevolution.\nI have yet to want to hug, cry and share\na moment of my life with a journalist.\nLuckily I will be meeting Barbara soon.\nShe has helped to re vital is e one lounge\npotato. Why read a newspaper or book? To\nremind you of hope, hope for a world in\nwhich Reagan could only be a cartoon\ncharacter and Thatcher his mouse.\n'Illustrations' is a new book by the novelist,\npoet and playwright Maureen Duffy, to be\npublished next month. For those of you\nwho need a popular is t reference point for\nnames; the dramatic television series 'First\nBorn', about a cross between a human and\na gorilla, was based upon one of Maureen's novels.\nThis time she tells the story of two\nwomen, separated by time, but joined\nthrough the words of historical documents.\nLetters tell the loneliness of a woman sent\nover to Germany to convert the 'heathens'\nto Christianity. It is the eighth century and\nwomen can rule the Abbey; teaching,\ntranslating, studying, discoursing and having\npower. Hilda reads these letters, helping her\nto find her own power in the discovery of\nthat of the writer. On travelling to Germany\nshe decides to delve deeper.\nA love affair begins with a young\nGerman woman, Helga, the privacy of their\nrelationship interrupted by anti-terrorist\npolice who suspect Helga of terrorism\nbecause of her political activities. The\nhistorical letters, in Latin, are read as coded\nmessages between subversives.\nMaureen portrays the beautiful sensuality\nof lesbian sex within a novel that helps\nreclaim another piece of history for women\nand examines the replacement of religious\ndoctrine with political. How does one\nescape the social framework that defines\nyou through the chains it forges? The most\nimportant thing to Maureen is hope, the\ndrive to find solutions.\nBanned for Blasphemy\nOn 18th September 1989 the British Board\nof Film Classification wrote a letter to the\nfilm maker Nigel Wingrove informing him\nof their decision to refuse to allow the\nrelease of his film 'Visions of Ecstasy'. An\nappeal failed to overturn the .banning. The\nsole reason given was that it would 'outrage\nthe feelings of Christians', that it was\n'contemptuous of the divinity of Christ' and\ntherefore 'that the video is blasphemous'.\nThis is the first and only film banned\nfrom sale or public showing because of the\nlaw of blasphemy. It is an erotic\ninterpretation of the dreams and feelings of\nthe sixteenth century Carmelite nun, St\nTeresa of Avila. To the powerful beat of\nmusic Teresa struggles with the sexuality of\nher visions, the pain of Christ and her own\nlove for him.\nWith the support of the international\nfreedom of expression pressure group\n'Article 19' Nigel is taking the British\nblasphemy law to the European Court of\nHuman Rights. Bringing this case, on his\nbehalf, is the Solicitor Mark Stephens,\nfounding partner of Stephens Innocent, a law firm that concentrates on arts and the\nmedia. The submission was made on 31st October 1990.\nMark is honorary solicitor to the\nContemporary Art Society, and the Public\nArt Development Trust. He has successfully\ndefended JSG Boggs - an American artist\nwho painted pound notes - from attack by\nthe Bank of England, advised on the display\nof Robert Mapplethorpes' images in this\ncountry and has recently taken the 'Foetal\nEarrings' case to the European Court of\nHuman Rights. He is freeman of the City of\nLondon and a past President of the London\nLaw Society.\nThis historical film is available on VHS\nfor a donation of \u00a325 towards the European\nCourt costs. In return for the donation you\nwill be sent a copy of 'Visions of Ecstasy'.\nCheques/Postal Orders should be made\npayable to 'Visions of Ecstasy Campaign'\nand sent to Flat 7, Dewhurst House, 3/6\nWinnett St, London W1A 4XG. Allow 14\ndays for delivery. Or you could obtain your\ncopy and meet both Nigel and Mark on\nSaturday 27th April.\nan, Dicks & God\nWicked Power & Censoring\nGavin Image Charity\nIf you have never bought a poetry book by\nGavin Ewart, and there are a large number\nof them, you may have a faint recognition\nof his name. Your memory probably relates\nto a rush hour crush, boringly looking\naround for something of interest, checking\nthe map, counting the stations. Ah, there's a poem. Gavin is one of those poets\nhonoured by having his work displayed on\nour tube trains. It is about a cat.\nGavin is known for his wicked humour\nand the vast range of his style and subjects.\nHis short poems are great pick-me-ups on\ngrey mornings, whilst his war poetry\nexamines the relationship between target\nand person, the confusion causing massacre\nand useful statistics on the effectiveness of\nfire-power. His most recent decade of\npoetry has now been published in one\nvolume. A wonderful menagerie of images,\nfeelings and jokes crafted from poems by a master craftsman. He is not only a good\nread he is a brilliant reader. Come and\nlisten to his poems celebrating wickedness\nand the art of expression.\nAt least one art college photography\ndepartment (Sir John Cass') includes the\nfollowing in its notes for students:\n'Work of a sexist and racist nature may\nnot be produced.'\nThe 'alternative' photographic culture of\nthe likes of the Polytechnic of Central\nLondon, Camerawork and The\nPhotographer's Gallery regard the erotic\nphotographs of Helmut Newton as sexist, as\ndegrading to women. This same culture\nvalues the work of Martin Parr and Chris\nKillip, which portray working people as\npowerless, defeated and passive.\nIn this workshop we will be looking at,\nusing illustrations, Newton's glamor is ation of power in contrast with Killip's celebration of powerlessness. The question\nwill be posed why is it that a culture which\nbelieves itself to be 'radical', 'critical',\n'alternative' prefers images of defeat to\nimages of power.\nDavid Murray - a visiting lecturer at City\nUniversity, private maths tutor and a photographer and photographic artist.\nBanned for Wrinkles\n\"1\nThe penis appears to be gaining greater\nacceptability, what with Wicked Willie\ndoing great business in books, mugs,\nunderwear and as a cuddly toy on the\nshelves of our high street shops. More and\nmore we are seeing the naked buttocks and\nflash of male genitals on our television\nscreens. Yet...\nWhat happens when you reduce poor\nWillie's size, lose the face with that nose,\nadd the wrinkles and foreskin - where\nappropriate - and unkempt hair. This\nappears to lose its family marketing appeal.\nMaybe parents can no longer explain it as a cuddly sausage. What happens to that great\nphallic power symbol, the American senator\nastride the polaris? Men can not be that\nvulnerable or funny, can they? But will they\nlet us laugh?\nJo Menell made 'Dick' as an attempt to\nuse the flaccid penis as a focus of\nentertainment. The film sets one thousand\nblack and white stills to music and the\ncomments of one hundred women. Time\nOut described it as 'seriously funny,\nhumane, surprising stuff...I defy a member\nof either sex to remain un boggled'. Despite the film being within the\nbroadcasting law, as none of the penises are\nerect, it has been banned from public\nbroadcasting. Jo, an American presently\nvisiting this country, will be talking about\nthe reasons for and responses to his film, as\nwell as answering questions. Come and\nmeet him and see 'Dick'.\nCopies of the video, T shirts, badges, car\nstickers and posters will be on sale at the\nevent.\nAs the PR officer for the cancer charity\nQuest for a Test, some five years ago, I met with several instances of censorship\nimposed on our attempts to promote public\nawareness of Quest's work. Quest is a national organisation funding non-animal\nresearch into the early detection of cancer.\nIt has developed a new cervical cancer test\nand is working on breast, nasal and bowel\ncancers.\nDue to its policy on not using animals in\nits work we decided to respond to a letter\nselling advertising space in a catalogue that\nwould accompany an arts exhibition called\n'A World's Waste'. The exhibition,\norganised with the help of the Cumbria Arts\nCouncil, included several artists' images of\nthe effects of pollution, including that\ncaused by nuclear power stations. It was to\ngo on a nationwide tour. We had decided\nthat those people interested in buying the\ncatalogue would also be interested in\nsupporting Quest, if the advert had the\nappropriate image. To the delight of the\neditor I booked a page of space.\nUsing Raymond Briggs' couple from\n'When the Wind Blows', who die from\nradiation poisoning, surrounded by a collage\nof newspaper cuttings about Sellafield leaks,\nleukaemia clusters and Chernobyl the advert\nmade a very powerful anti-nuclear power\nimage linking it with the importance of\nearly cancer detection. The editor thought it\nwas highly appropriate for his catalogue,\nbut was having problems with the\ncommittee. Next thing we heard was that\nour advert had been banned and the editor\nwas on 'sick' leave. I was told that it was\ntoo powerful an image in the context of the\ncatalogue and exhibition!\nMoney raised from the Party Against\nCensorship is being donated to Quest, as\nwell as Article 19 and the European Court\nCase against the blasphemy law.\n10 11\n\n"

    "content": "'I Dr Gillon Critisised\nDoctor Raanan Gillon, Director of the\nCollege Health Service, has been crit is is ed by the Evening Standard Newspaper for\nhis attitude toward prescription.\nDr Gillon had been consulted as part of\na question and answer session in a health\njournal on the ethics of allowing students\nto obtain beta blockers to help them\nthrough examinations. His response had\nbeen that there was nothing wrong with\nthe prescription provided that the patient\nknew the effects. Beta blockers are drugs\nwhich block adrenal in, reducing stress\nand anxiety which could affect\nperformance.\nThe Evening Standard article was of the\nopinion that Dr Gillon was urging people\nto take drugs and that the advantages\ngiven to those willing to take the beta\nblockers were unfair. Dr Gillon informed\nFelix that he was not encouraging\nanybody to take beta blockers, merely\nthat he was making a legal drug available\nto calm people whose performance in\nexaminations would suffer due to anxiety.\nHe added that side effects were minimal\nand that allergic reactions very rare.\nOn the question of unfair competition\nDr Gillon commented that people should\nbe able to sit examinations without\nextreme anxiety affecting their\nperformance, and that any question of\nunfairness was merely due to\nconventional thinking.\nFor those suffering under the stress of\nexams, the health centre is running an\nexam stress management group on the\nnext two Wednesdays at 1.15pm. They\nshould be contacted in advance on\ninternal 3099.\nIC Survey Careers Resignation\nThe Union is bringing out a market\nresearch questionnaire this Tuesday. The\nquestionnaire, which will be used to\nimprove the facilities provided by the\nUnion, will be handed out in departments\nthroughout the day. A SI.00 voucher has\nbeen included in each booklet as an\nincentive for completion.

The decision was\ntaken by the Management Planning\nGroup and ratified by the Heads of\nDepartment.\nThe withdrawal will mean that students\nwishing to use the ULCAS library for\ncareers information will then have to\nspend the \u00a35 charge levied at non-members. The frequency at which this\nwill be necessary remains to be seen,\ndepending on the improvements made to\nIC's currently inadequate library.\nJohn Riding, the Union Bar Manager,\nresigned on Wednesday and gave four\nweeks notice. He is, however, willing to\nremain in the job until a suitable\nreplacement is found, as he does not\nwant to let the students down.\nJohn, who was a student in the Royal\nSchool of Mines before becoming the\nUnion Bar Manager in September last\nyear, will be sadly missed by the Felix\nOffice and all who know him. We extend\nour thanks and wish him all the best in\nthe tutu re.7 Censorship Explored\nThe largest student conference organised\nat Imperial College will take place\ntomorrow. With the help of the producers\nof Channel 4's 'Banned' series and the\nSpitting Image puppet Ronald Reagan, the\nT.H. Huxley society has managed to\ninvite twenty two speakers, amongst\nwhich are the key figures in this\ncountry's censorship debate.'\nApart from the leaders of pressure\ngroups against censorship, speakers will\ninclude the film makers whose works\nChannel 4 could not show. Jo Menell will\nbe explaining why his film 'Dick' was\nmade and giving his reaction to it's banning and Nigel Wingrove will talk\nabout 'Visions of Ecstacy', the first and\nonly film ever to be banned for\nblasphemy, in this country. Both films will\nbe shown at the conference.\nOther contributors are Peter Jylueita,\nprosecuted for displaying freeze dried\nfetus ear-rings as art, Dr Halstead,\ngeology lecturer at Imperial critically\nanalysing the commercialism of science\nand museums and Terry Sanderson, the\nMedia Watch columnist for Gay Times,\nwho successfully campaigned against The\nSun's reporting of gays and lesbians.\nMichael Newman, organiser of\n'To Boldly Go', tomorrow's event.\nThe Event has attracted the support of\nmany campaign ig groups and already\nseems to be gaining the interest of the\nnational press.\n\n"

Members of\nthe club tend to be those students who\neither previously owned a motorbike\nbefore coming to IC or those who have\njoined to consume their passion. These\nmembers are always willing to learn\nmore about motorcycles through the\nevents run by the club.\nFor those who own a bike, the club\nruns a workshop specifically designed to\nhelp with the maintenance of\nmotorcycles. It provides tools which the\nbikers could not otherwise easily acquire\nand enables them to keep their bikes in\ngood condition. For mechanical faults and\nany other such problems, advice is freely\navailable from the experts who run the\nworkshop.\nA successful project undertaken by the\nclub in association with the Police is the\nAdvanced Driving Test. It consists of a few lectures plus a four hours riding\nexperience on the roads. The practical\npart of the course involves the students\ndriving at speed through London\naccompanied by a Police motorcyclist.\nThis may seem dangerous, but it actually\nteaches the student how to control the\nvehicle in extreme conditions, so at\nnormal speeds they are able to handle\ntheir vehicles efficiently.\nAnother event organised biannually by\nthe club is the Auto-Test.This is when\nthey commission the IC car park for the\nday, and test their skills of man oe uv ring by hurtling round as fast as they possible\ncan.Apparently this help to make the\nbikers better drivers, but somehow I think\nthis is just an excuse for them to have a good time!\nDuring the summer the club arranges a party of bikers to go to a major racing\nvenue. There, they are given the chance\nto hire a400cc bike together with all the\nequipment, and then to participate in a race around the track. The braver one\nactually reach speeds of lOOm ph plus, but\nthe sharp bends of the circuit act as a limiting factor for the bravado shown.\nBrans Hatch (in Kent) used to be the\nvenue hosting this event, but last year it\nwas held at Mallory Park (in\nLeicestershire), and plans are being made\nto go to Cadwell Park (in Lincolnshire)\nthis year.\nOn the social side, members of the club\nget together on Thursday evenings and\ngo out onto the streets of London for a ride. They then meet up at a pub for a drink. What else! However, I am\nreassuringly told, that the vast majority\nonly drink orange juice, so when they\neventually leave for home on their bikes,\nthere is no chance of them coming into\ntrouble with the law!\nA final service operated by the club is\nlegal advice. The club is proud to have\nthe services of a reputable lawyer who\nspecialises in 'Bent Metal' cases. This is\nthe legal jargon used for traffic accidents\ninvolving motorcycles. The life\nexpectancy of the biker is said to average\n7 years - not a lot eh! So any member,\nunlucky enough to be involved in an\naccident, is able to establish what his\nlegal rights are without any financial cost.\nFun Run\nWell the Marathon's over! But the real\nFun Run has yet to take place...\nOn Saturday May 18th, the 100 mph\nCharity Fun Run is being held to raise\nmoney for cancer charities. For those\nwho want to have a go, the idea is to jog\nas far as you can in 1 hour and to get\nyour friends to sponsor you for each mile\nrun. If you're either a real quick runner,\nor have got very generous friends, we'll\nhopefully raise loads of money for the\ncancer research and relief charities.\nThe run is being organised by ICS &\nWPC and is open to anyone who wishes\nto participate. To join in the fun:\n1)Pick up a sponsorship form from the\nIC Sports Centre\n2)Gets loads of people to sponsor you\n3) Turn up at the Sports Centre by\n10.30 am to register to run\n4)From 11am, try to run as far as you\ncan!\nThat's how easy it is to have a go, and\nThis is exactly what happened to one\nmember recently, when he was hit by a bus. With the legal advice provided, he\nwas able to take his case to court, and\nwas awarded the maximum damages of\n\u00a33000.\nVerdict:This club is a paradise for any\nmotorcycle enthusiast. It is responsibly\nrun by 'Uncle' Nick, with many various\nevents organised. A newsletter is also\npublished regularly to keep the members\ninformed of what is going on. Those of\nyou who think this is an activity for guys\nonly will be surprised to learn that the\nclubs leading biker is a female. The only\ndrawback is the cost of participating in\nthe events, which can mean forking out\nas much as \u00a3100 or more. So if anyone is\ninterested in joining the club, go along to\none of their meetings on Wednesdays at\n12.30pm in the Southside Lounge.\nPIMLICO\nCONNECTION\nNo obligation\nintroductory\nmeeting\u2014come and\nfind out more about\ntutoring in schools\nMech Eng 313A12.45 pm Tuesday April 30th FREE TEA AND\nBISCUITS\nif the weather's fine it should be a great\nway to help cancer sufferers.\nThe ICS & WPC is sponsored by Salomon\nBrothers International Limited and\nCooper & Lybrand Deloitte.\n\n"

    "content": "9\nFELIX\nHow do we know what is true? Do we rely upon trust? Is this\nreally important to us?\nParty Against Censorship\nAs scientists and engineers what is reality, or\nat least how we see it, is a vital part of our\nwork. Afterall how can we discover any new\nknowledge if we can not judge that it is true?\nJacob Bronowski, the presenter and writer of\nthe famous television series called 'Ascent of\nMan', believed very strongly in the importance\nof criteria to judge truth.\nHe wrote several books about the\nrelationship between science and our values.\nTo Bronowski, a Humanist, science was a subject that helped us to construct our ethics\nand understand why we have them. A quote\nfrom one of his books sums up the importance\nof understanding the nature of knowledge and\ntruth to how we see each other.\n'When we discard the test of fact in what a star is, we discard it in what a man is. A society holds together by the respect which\nman gives to man; it fails in fact, it falls apart\ninto groups of fear and power, when its\nconcept of man is false.'\nTo examine the issues of knowledge, its\nnature, what can affect its creation and\ncommunication, the T.H. Huxley Society has\norganised a massive conference on Saturday\n27th April.

    "content": "Wings of Fame\nI It is 1969, Caesar Valentin (Peter\nIO 'Toole) is a rich and famous actor.\nBrainsmith (Colin Firth\u2014A Month in\nthe Country, Tumbledown) is a poor\nwriter, whose only success is a biography\nof Valentin, called Wings of Fame.\nValentin has taken this book and put his\nown name to it. Smith, determined to be\nrecognised, finds all paths to the mega star blocked by flunkies and sycophants. In\ndesperation and in public he assassinates\nValentin, while getting himself killed by a falling camera light.\nIs this the end of the film? You ask. No\nway, this is the first ten minutes.\nThey are taken to a hotel which is their\nsurreal resting place. It is populated by\nthe celebrities, Albert Einstein and Ernest\nHemmingway are named and many\nothers are referred to, but disguised with\npseudonyms. Each one lives their own\nvain, self-centred life, ignoring the fact\nthat their fame is fading on Earth. As the\nmemory of Earth disappears, so does the\nquality of life in the hotel, until finally\nthey disappear into oblivion.\nValentin and Smith are now linked,\nwhenever Valentin is remembered so will\nSmith be. They become antagonists,\nfighting over each other and the beautiful\nBianca (Marie Trintignant), who has been\ndriven insane and refuses to believe she\nis dead.\nThis is where the meat of the film is.\nValentin having to cope with his loss of\nfame and treating his murderer with\nrespect. Drunken, conceited and self-obsessed, Peter O 'Toole plays as if the\npart was written for him. Colin Firth\nseems relaxed as the confused writer\ntrying to get revenge on someone he is\nnow bound to, as well as loving a woman\nwho doesn't know her own identity.\nThis could easily have become deep\nand meaningful (meaningless), but the\nDirector, Otakar Votocek, keeps the tone\nhumourous but significant throughout. My\nonly fault with the film would be the\nclimax which is dark and violent, in\ncontrast to the rest of the film and seems\nout of place. Overall a light and funny\nsatire on the importance celebrities place\non their own fame and how quickly it is\nforgotten. Well worth going to see, if you\nwant something a little deeper than\nRambo but can't stomach three hours of\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being.\nJonty.\nThe Jetsons\nOkay! 60's revival cartoons from\n. Hanna Barbera! Scooby Dool The\nFlintstones! Great! Alas, The\nJetsons is not such a cartoon.\nThe Jetsons is a everyday story of\nordinary stereotypes in the far future.\nSaid plain folk comprise George (The\nRadiant American Male), his wife who\ndoesn't get a name because she's only\nthere to be a good homemaker, his son\nPainintheass and his daughter Judy, a music mad teen who is voiced by Tiffany\nof all people. Tiff also supplies a good\ndeal of the music (cough, cough) for this\nfeature so I need not elaborate on this\npoint. Suffice it to say that the cries of\nwarthogs fall more gently on my ears.\nSo what's it about ?\nNOTHING.\nIn an effort to keep abreast of\nsociological change, Mrs. Jetson is still\nchained to the kitchen sink, Judy shops at\nthe mall and falls for any sufficiently\nhunk y dick head in range, the kid is\nirritatingly cute and bounces around with\nthe aid of several diabolically fluffy pals.\nSure, it's only a cartoon but isn't it time\nkids got decent characters to go with\ntheir moral homilies ?\nBolted onto this sad assemblage of\nDramatic Personae is a scrip M hat throws\nin an ecological theme (a concession to\nthe real world) which feels rather like the\ncautionary bit at the end of Inspector\nGadget.\nThe gags (according to the press\nrelease) are deliberately modelled after\nthose of the original series, which by\ndefinition mean they're very dated. A lot\nof rubbish puns and a lot of violent\nmetallic collisions. An appalling sequence\nof swirling colours and tacky backdrops\nas Tiff sings about pre pubescent love.\nThe cast (apart from the deplorable\nTiffany) carry off their parts well, for the\nmost part. The blame for this film must\nlie with the scriptwriters, who have\ninflated half an hour's idea into two\nhours. Roll on the Scooby Doo epic.\nFor small children. Small and simple-minded children.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nWhen What Where\nWings Of Fame:\nThe Jetsons\nHamlet\nLook Who...

    "content": "....and Societies A Oxfam Youth, HA\n'Oxfam believes in the essential dignity of\npeople and their ability to overcome the\nproblems and pressures which can crush\nand exploit them. These may be rooted\nin climate geography, or in the more\ncomplex area of economic, political and\nsocial conditions' (Field Director's Handbook).\nThe West London Chaplaincy is\ncurrently running an Oxfam lunch in\nCollege every Tuesday lunchtime from\n12.30pm1.30 pm. the idea is to come\nalong and eat a simple meal consisting of\nbread and cheese. For this we ask for a donation of \u00a31 and the proceeds will then\nbe given to Oxfam\u2014a charity\norganisation which is committed to\nworking alongside people internationally\non a wide range of development issues eg\nconcerning the environment, human\nrights, economics and education.\nHaving left the problem sheets and lab\nreports far behind, ev even members of\nthe group arrived beside Loch Torridon\nin Wester Ross, Scotland to begin our\nEaster camping trip, On the first few days\nwe made the most of the great weather\nand clear skies to explore the mountains\nof the area, including Beinn Alligin and\nSlioch.\nWith the morning porridge ration inside\nus, just the thing to get you moving, we\nwere ready to tackle Slioch. The first part\nof the walk involved going along the\nband of Loch Masee and then lunching at\na waterfall. From there the tre ck upwards\nbegan and on walking up a gulley to\nreach the mountain ridge we came across\na group of deer. So it was out with\ncameras for the great nature shot before\nthey raced on. At the top (3215 ft) the\nview was amazing; mountains interwoven\nwith lochs and out to sea glimpses of\nSkye and the outer Hebrides.\nWith these hills behind us the major\npeaks of the region were tackled, Beinn\nEighe and also Liathach, the towering\nmountain which rose from the camp side. On these tops, though, there was much\nsnow and low cloud giving a completely\ndifferent atmosphere.\nNot all the time was spent up in the\nhills. One day we were over the sea to\nSkye. The crossing however was very\ndisappointing with neither pipers nor mist\nbut just five minutes on a floating bridge\nleaving the mainland beside the scenic\nfish factory. On another day we did a coastal walk where, -in the middle of a boggy wilderness, with only seals and\ngoats nearby, we found a remote hostel.\nThe warden called us over, gave us a cup\nof tea and told his life story.\nOn the last night we stayed in the\npalatial Loch Lomond hostel. This was a great place to have our last meal in\nScotland which of course was Haggis.\nMeaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy When Chris Akabusi, the top international\nrunner, was a lad he had three very good\nschool mates. One was Tommy Smith, a no-hope r who died at the age of twelve\nfrom treading on a drawing pin, one was\nMick Robertson, who became a top ITV\npresenter on Magpie, the other was\nMonsieur Mange-Tout, the great man who\neats everything, he had very poor table\nmanners then and in fact in general he\nhad Bad Manners.\nCoincidentally the main act at the\nCarnival tonight is Bad Manners, back by\npopular demand Buster Bloodvessel and\nthe boys are back in a big way after a two year absence from IC. They need no\nintroduction but rest assured there will be\na barrage of those classic Bad Manners\nreggae hits from y ester year, such as Lip\nUp Fatty, Walking in the Sunshine and of\ncourse The Can Can. An act definitely not\nto miss.\nPlaying downstairs is the truly\nwonderful Tommy Chase Quartet. Their\nmix of jazz with hard driving rhythms\nwill bring even those who have not had a 'good boogie' in years to their feet. Also\non the bill is top in di mop tops Jefferson\nAirhead. Their first single Congratulations\nis soaring up the in di charts so you should\ncatch them at IC now before they are the\nnext big stadium band. The final band on\nthe bill is the Cuckoos. After a previous\nappearance here last year they are\nattracting a lot of press and seem to be\non the verge of a breakthrough.\nAs well as the great bands the now\nfamous Ents Disco will be pumping out\nloud all night with super DJ Dom-o nick\nplaying the latest and greatest of all kinds\nof popular and underground tunes. As\nwell as this there will be the Monte-Carlo\ntype casino where you can win all sorts\nof pointless objects you never needed or\nwanted. There is also a late bar so to aid\nyour enjoyment of the night you can get\nreally pissed and not remember a thing\nabout anything. And for those whose\nlivers are tired of living there will be\ncocktails served on the top floor.\nThe whole event will cost you \u00a34 in\nadvance (or \u00a33 with Ents card) and if\nthere re any tickets left, \u00a35 on the door.\nThe event kicks off at 8pm and please\nremember to bring you Union card\notherwise entry will be denied.\nNo free entry to Union after 8pm.

    "content": "Encyclopaedia Psychedelia\nJust how much does today's dance\nculture owe to ageing hippies that\nhang around herba cio us borders and\n'dig gardening'? We at Felix fearlessly\ninvestigate...\nPsychedelic: a.( of drug) hallucinatory,\ngiving illusion of freedom from limitations\nof reality; suggesting experience or effect\nof such drugs. (The Oxford Dictionary).\nThus psychedelic music was born.\nOriginally used to describe music which\ntried to recreate the LSD experience,\neither though the sound or the lyrics of\nthe songs, it soon became an all-en comp a sing term which included psych-punk, folk-rock and acid-rock.\nSan Francisco was the centre of this\nnew music which, with its pre-existing\nradical students and the onset of the\nVietnam war, gave rise to a new youth\ngroup: the dreaded hippy. Hippies, with\ntheir pathetic ramblings about being at\none with the cosmos etc...were doomed\nfrom the start but at least they raised\ngreen issues and gave us some shit-hot\nmusic. Early SF psychedelic bands like\nthe Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and\nCountry Joe and the Fish were folk, blues\nand jazz based but as LSD became more\nwidespread (through Ken Kesey and his\nMerry Pranksters and Timothy Leary's preachings) so their music evolved. Tom\nWolfe's book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid\nTest documents Ken Kesey's exploits and\nSeal\nThe first track exudes taste, a classic\nvelvet vocal over a soothing melody\ncombine to produce something far greater\nthan the sum of its parts. Put it on and\nrelax, let it wash over you, let its warmth\nand peace flow through you.\nOn the flip side (after all and EP is\nis a great read.\nElsewhere in the USA psychedelia was\nalso developing, notably in Los Angeles\nand Texas. From LA came folk rock with\nbands like The Byrds, The Turtles and\nBuffalo Springfield (from whence came\nNeil Young and CSN&Y) who were more\npolitical and hippy than their SF\ncounterparts. Also from LA were The\nDoors, Love and The Seeds, bands who,\nin the late 60s, became prominent with\ntheir acid-rock though all their surviving\nmembers are somewhat brain-dead.\nFrom Texas came the first true\npsychedelic band The 13th Floor\nElevators as well as Doug Sahm with his\nfreaked-out blues and. The Mysterians\nwho brought garage-punk to prominence.\nOut of Detroit came the Godfather of\nPunk (Iggy Stooge) and other heavy\nps cy che deli c rock bands like SRC, and the\nAmboy Dukes and the legendary MC5.\nThese heavy bands, along with the likes\nof Iron Butterfly, Vanilla Fudge and\nSteppenwolf were the original proto-heavy metal lists, laying the foundations\nfor the 70s hard rock boom and,\nunfortunately, progressive rock.\nPsychedelic music in Britain tended to\nlack the improvisation and looseness of\nthe American bands, but had tighter\nlyrics with a more commercial slant. The\nBeatles, through their involvement with\nEastern mysticism, gave us two of the\nbest albums ever (Rubber Soul &\nRevolver), though the Rolling Stones'\nflirtation {Their Satanic Majesties Request)\n\u2014Future Love EP\nsupposed to be as a whole) are two tracks\nthat complement each other perfectly\n(rhubarb and custard). 'Violet' is a cool\nmellow track that rounds of perfectly a quarter of an hour of shear pleasure.\nAnna B wasn't such a success.\nPink Floyd and the Soft Machine were\nR&B based to begin with but soon grew\ntheir flares and flipped their wigs.\nLikewise Donovan and Traffic (led by a younger Stevie Winwood) were folk-based\nbut the acid experience transformed their\nstyle.\nPsychedelia has also had a big influence\non fashion with its colourful designs,\nimages, posters and paintings. Witness the\n80's Acid House explosion and its use of\nbright fashions and the trance-like quality\nof its music, coupled to the increase in\nEcstacy use.\nSixties garage-punk, along with the\nStooges, was the major influence on most\nof the late 70s punk bands. The tell-tale\njingle jangle of the Byrds' Rickenbacker\nguitars influenced most of the 80s indie-pop bands, whilst there is a distinct 60's feel to bands like the Stone Roses and\nThe Charlatans.\nSo pop-pickers next time you feel like\nsome new tunes to buzz around your\nhead, stop for a second and think of\nsome old hippy and his groovy music,\nBUT only for a second as you know you\nhave to kill him and then what the hell\nbuy the record anyway 'cos you know\nyou'll love it and do your ears a real big\nfavour. Ladies and Gentleman the MC5\nwere the co ooo ooo lest band ever and\nyou gotta check them our right now or\nyour soul will never be cleansed. The\nEnd.\nDominic.\nThe Hypnotist\n\u2014Rainbow in the Sky 7\"\nImagine a nail being driven into your\nskull, the end blunted and covered in\nacid. Feel the pain as its connected to the\nnational grid, feel the power rush through\nyour mind, feel yourself. This track drives\nalong like a blind man in a Ferrari, you\nnever know where its going but it'll get\nthere bloody quick.\nAnna B WWSk\n\n"

Sex\nCymbal. What a pathetic title. Sheila E. comes from Prince's backing band or\nsomething. But you don't need me to tell\nyou that. Pick any track off this album\nand it becomes blatantly obvious to the\nmost tone-deaf ear. There's also an advert\nfor ECO, 'to receive additional\ninformation on how YOU can save the\nplanet, send $2 to...' and a drum solo\n(Pretentious? Moi?) called 808 Kate. Is this\nsomething to do with the Manchester\nr avers( Now with added SugarCube) or\njust the drum machine. Stuff like this\nshould be put on the inner sleeve, if\nthere was any room left. I really want to\ngive this a right s lagging, but its sheer\ninnocuous ness(?), a cross between Prince\nand Gloria Estefan, leaves so little to pick\nat, and gripe about. It's dinner party\nmusic, music which you hear but never\nlisten to.

Veering from soul\n(like the excellent mid-tempo opener and\nformer single Temple of Love) to power-pop, her debut album is a strong\nshowcase for her singing talents. Though\nsome of the songs do show heavy handed\nproduction which tends to make them\nsound somewhat empty, Harriet's songwriting ability (she co-wrote most of\nthe songs on the album and Quincy Jones\nused one of her songs on his Back on the\nBlock album from last year) is never in\ndoubt. Most of her songs may be love-tracks for late in the evening, but her\nvoice constantly shines through. This\ngirl's star is most definitely on the rise\nand though Britain is proving slow to\ncatch on to her, she is currently enjoying\nStateside and European success.

The reason for\nthis was completely mystery, perhaps I missed something?\nTaking the stage amidst a plume of\nsmoke like creatures from the blue\nlagoon, the Ned's produced a live set that\nwas energetic and vibrant, drawing on all\ntheir experience and sending the crowd\ninto a sweated frenzy of dancing. They\nlasted only two songs before the chants\nof 'we want Happy' prompted them to\nperform the track that has caused their\nrenaming as Ned's Polished Dustbin.\nTaking it in the context of the rest of\ntheir performance it did seem slightly out\nof place and maybe a touch subdued.\nOnce the crowd's cravings had been\nsatisfied they continued their set\nconcentrating on the more tried and\ntested with only one new song. After the\ninitial explosive antics of the crowd they\nseemed content simply to try and bounce\ntheir way through the floor.\nAt the end of a rather disappointingly\nshort set, rounding off with a lively\nrendition of 'Throwing Things', T shirts,\ndrum sticks and finally, a member of the\nband (wearing a particularly sexy pair of\nboxer shorts) all found their way\ncrowd bound.

    "content": "Scribblers' Corner\nSeasoned Rebuke\nDear Andy,\nAs probably one of your longest\nestablished readers, I have been at various\ntimes informed, amused, irritated and\nconfused by FELIX over the years. Seldom,\nhowever, have I ever felt it necessary to\ncontribute to your correspondence columns;\nbut the misunderstandings and\nmisconceptions which pepper your editorial\non the proposed changes to the careers\nservice (FELIX edition 900 page 35) has\ninduced me to break the habits of a lifetime.\nWhat prompts the unjustified conclusion,\nwhich runs through your comments, that\nthere is some sort of conspiracy to damage\nthe careers service? Does it not cross\nanybody's mind that we might be trying to\nbuild a stronger, better careers service for\nthe students of Imperial College? As\nsomeone who has been involved for many\nyears in developing the careers service, I take it amiss. It was me who brought the\nULCAS advisers into the College 20 years\nago\u2014against, I might say, opposition from\na number of the then departmental careers\nadvisers. In the early years, students were\nnot allowed to see the UL CAS careers\nadviser, unless so recommended by their\nDCA. It took a little time to change that\nattitude. When I took over responsibility for\nthe administration of the College careers\nservice (and the ULCAS advisers are\nresponsible to me now as well as under the\nfuture arrangements), there were no\ninterview rooms, no careers information\nroom and a limited 'milk-round'; interviews\nwere often held in corridors, frequently on\na Wednesday afternoon and in the case of\none department, on Saturday mornings! We\nhave come a long way since, then and I am\ncertainly not involved in knocking all this\ndown.\nI was a user myself of UL CAS when I graduated from UCL( it was called the\nUniversity Appointments Board in those\ndays) so I was aware of its value to\nstudents when I argued for its services\nbeing available in the College. However,\ntimes and circumstances change; but now\nthat a revised organisation is being proposed\nit does not mean that the service is to be\ndowngraded. There is no question of a 'direct labour policy' as you describe it.\nThe aim will be to provide the most\nprofessional service possible, with a comprehensive range of careers guidance,\ninformation and counselling\u2014but avoiding\nthe second tier management structure which\nnow exists. No one disputes the\nprofessionalism of the UL CAS careers\nadvisers. But there are 40 odd university\ncareers services round the country, also\nindependent of ULCAS, all of whom\nreckon they are giving a pretty professional\nservice to their students. Why should this\nnot be possible at IC? In any case, although\nindependent of ULCAS, we do still live on\nthe same planet and we are still talking. I have already had discussions with \"the\nDirector of UL CAS, with a view to IC\nparticipating in training courses and\nseminars, and to IC students accessing the\nGordon Square careers library and the\nGordon Square milk-round. The difference\nis that this will be paid for on the basis of\nusage, not on the basis of a charge for the\nentire overheads in Gordon Square\ncalculated on our total student numbers. (70\nIC students used the Gordon Square milk-round this year).\nThere are no 'start-up' investment costs\nof which Angus Fraser is unaware. The\nestimated costs of our own careers service\ninclude provision for accessing facilities at\nGordon Square; and although cost is not the\nultimate determinant, it will be cheaper for\nus to provide an enhanced service rather\nthan paying the University for the existing\nprovision\u2014at a cost which has just been\nCity & Guilds\nMAY BALL Swallow International Hotel\nFriday 10th May\n\u00a347 per double ticket\n*Champagne Cocktail* \u2022 Three Course Meal* \u2022Coffee & Petit Four s* \u2022 Liqueurs* \u2022 Disco until lam* TICKETS FROM GUILDS OFFICE\n\n"

    "content": "Green Card\nThe annoying thing about being a reviewer and film buff (apart from\neditors) is the fact that you start to\nget critical about any film that you go to\nsee. Small inaccuracies or scenes which\ncould have been done better start to\nniggle, then you irritate the hell out of\npeople by ranting copiously about various\nthings ('Fritz Lang would have done it\nbetter' etc.)\nNot so Green Card. It is among the few\nperfect films, which leave you wishing\nthat they could go on when you are left\nwith nothing but a memory. But I'm ranting. On with the storyline. Bronte\n(Andie MacDowell) wants a flat which is\nonly available to married couples. George\n(Gerard Depardieu) wants a work permit;\na Green Card so that he can get a job\nand stay in America. So, two people who\nhave never met before in their lives, get\nmarried, never expecting to see each\nother again.\nUnfortunately the government is not so\namenable to their schemes, and sets out\nto 'investigate' the marriage. George and\nBronte therefore decide to fake a happy\nmarriage so that each of them can keep\ntheir gains. From the start they realise\nthat they have nothing in common, but\nstart to learn all they can about each\nother to get past the separate interviews\nthat they have to face. As is obvious from\nthe film trailers and advertising, the two\nof they fall in love, playing many\nextraordinarily good comic scenes along\nthe way.\nI think that Gerard Depardieu is the\nsexiest man I 've ever seen and Rose says\nshe likes the flat. A film to seduce by.\nMurph with a little bit from Rose.\nSalome\nO Salome, the beautiful, exotic, erotic\nstep-daughter of Herod, dances for\nthe t it il ation of the Judaean court\nand claims as payment the head of\nJokanaan (the prophet John the Baptist).\nShe is a powerful symbol of the\ncorruption and decay of the ruling classes\nat the time of Christ.\nYet Richard Strauss's opera, based on\nthe Oscar Wilde poem, makes it clear\nthat Salome is also a victim. When she\nmakes her first entrance, she is fleeing\nfrom the unwelcome gaze of her step-father. She is fascinated by Jokanaan,\nalthough she does not understand him,\nand she is trapped into revenge by her\nanger when Jokanaan rejects her sexual\nadvances.\nThe Straus opera is unevenly plotted.\nWhile the captain of the guard,\nNabarroth, is given ample time to express\nhis infatuation with Salome, his despair\nand suicide over her lust for Jokanaan is\ndealt with rather per fun ctor ly in the\nscore. Salome's obsession with Jokanaan\nseems to develop equally abruptly.\nHowever, her exploitation of Herod's lust,\nthrough her dance, to gain her revenge\non Jokanaan is carefully constructed so\nthat we see Herod's increasing excitement\nlead him into his foolish oath to give her\nanything.\nKristine Ciesinski and Dimitri\nKharitonov carry off the central roles of\nSalome and Jokanaan extremely well,\nboth in terms of singing and acting. They\nshare the talents of a strong, rich voice\nand excellent diction (although occasional\nlapses into her native American accent by\nCiesinksi were rather off putting). Above\nall, Ciesinski handles Salome's dance in a way that is both salacious and dignified.\nAlan Woodrow, as Herod, combines\nbluster and lust in equal measures in a way that suggests he is incapable of\ncontrolling either his kingdom or his\npassions.\nThe staging is good, although not as\noutstanding as some productions this\nyear. While most of the costumes neatly\ncaptured a sense of period and style,\nHerodias's page looked irritatingly\ninelegant. The ENO orchestra was of the\nusual high standard and crisply conducted\nby Richard Armstrong.\nThis is a good revival and an enjoyable\nevening and, at 1% hours, not overlong.\nBe warned, however, that your taste in\nopera has to verge on the Wagnerian to\nfully appreciate it.\nLiz W. Desperate Hours\nFA jailed murderer forces his way\nout of a tribunal hearing and into\nthe lives and home of a normal\nAmerican family with two lovely kids and\naccess once a week.\nThe mode of escape for Mickey Rourke,\nour psychopathic killer, is a curious one.\nHe seems to be aided by his lovely lady\nattorney, who sets up an escape car and\nsmuggles a gun into court. During the\nescape, of course, she must play the\nvictim. This she does well. So well, in\nfact, that one is confused as to whether\nshe was actually involved in the escape at\nall.\nWe now come to the All American\nFamily. A young, likeable son and a rebellious teenage daughter, a caring\nmother who doesn't seem to do much\n(when a splendid dinner appears in the\nmiddle of the madman's reign of terror,\nthere is only the barest hint that she,\nsomehow, had the nerves required to\ncook it) and a father who ran off with his\nsecretary but got homesick and likes to\ntake the kids out.\nHow this family cope with a lunatic in\ntheir midst forms the meat of the film,\nand it's slightly overdone. Mimi Rogers\nand Anthony Hopkins, the couple held\ncaptive by Rourke, try hard to be scared\nbut as they scheme against him, they\nbecome rather too willing to risk their\nlives on crazy schemes. Perhaps this film\nis really saying that downtrodden\nsuburbanites are heros after all.\nToby.\n8\n\n"

    "content": "Hamlet\nF Chief, Chief, is it nobler in the mind\nto bear the slings and arrows of\noutrageous fortune, or what?\nThe concept of Mel Mad Max Gibson\nplaying one of the Bard's greatest\ncharacters has been sending ripples of\namusement through the serious critical\ncommunity for months. This shows the\ndepth of misconception many people\nhave about film adaptations. Zeffireli was\nnot producing a film version of a stage\nplay. He was producing a film derived\nfrom a play text (subtle difference).\nTo make a four hour long play suitable\nfor the screen a lot of changes have had\nto be made. Vast swathes of the text\nhave been cut away to leave exposed the\nbare bones that form the basis of the\nplay, indeed, some have estimated that\nonly 20% of the original text remains.\nSome of the crucial speeches have been\nmoved around, and scene's characters\nchanged. The Shakespeare scholars will\nbe up in arms. But it works.\nWhat we have is two hour's worth of\nmurder, and revenge, lust and passion,\nlife and death (mainly death). Gibson's Hamlet treads the line between the\nathletic and the academic. He can\noutclass Laertes in a duel, and dance\nrings round Polonius (Ian Holm) in a verbal game. His almost legendary eyes\nmanage to convey both the madness and\nthe pain in the character's soul. He also\nhas a remarkably silly beard and as nog up with his mother (Incest is Best).\nGlen Close's Gertrude is slightly less\nconvincing, choosing to play her as a somewhat flighty female, who is\ndesperate for the 'love' (tact, tact) of her\nlate husband's brother (Alan Bates, who is\nnot in the slightest young and virile, so\nquite why Ms.Close lusts after him is a complete mystery).\nHelena Bonham-Carter manages to go\nmad (and drown) prettily and Paul\nSchofield is sufficiently Ghostly Ghost.\nThe lovely scenery shot around the UK,\nis an equally good actor, who can look\nmean and moody, or just impressive,\nalmost exactly to cue.\nSilliness apart, this is actually a remarkably enjoyable film. While purists\nwill not regard it as 'good' Shakespeare, it\nretains the driving tragic force, and\ncrucial plot conflicts that made the play\nwhat it is. It makes for an absorbing two\nhours viewing, which should bring the\ngenius of the Bard to a whole new\naudience.\nPendragon.\nLSO\nHThe eloquence and emotional\nintensity of Dmitri Shostakovich's first violin concerto and eighth\nsymphony were exposed by the assured\nconducting of his son Maxim, ably\nabetted by the expressiveness of the\nAmerican violinist Nadja\nSalerno-Sonn e nberg. Shostakovich composed the violin\nconcerto in 1947-48, but it was criticised\nby his contemporaries as self-indulgent\nand unfashionable and was therefore not\nperformed until 1955. In this\nperformance, Salerno-Sonnenberg\nmaintained a balance of interplay with\nthe orchestra which showed that\nShostakovich's 'self-indulgence' had\nproduced a passionate and exquisite\npiece.\nThe eighth symphony was composed\nrapidly in 1943 and is Shostakovich's War\nSymphony. It captures the bleakness of\nthe war years combined with heroism,\nand reflects the 'epic' nature of that time.\nThe LSO displayed their strength in both\nsoloist and ensemble playing. Particular\ncredit should to to timpanist Kurt-Hans\nGoedicke and trumpet Maurice Murphy.\nMy only criticism of the concert is that\nthe combination of two pieces of such\nintensity made excessive demands on the\naudience. The stamina of the LSO in\ntackling both in the same programme is\nto be commended.\nLiz W Look Who's Talking Too\n\u2022\nSince all of the best gags went into So, it's not much of a plot, but that's the first film, there had to be a not why you're going to see it, is it?\ngood reason for making a sequel Anyone who enjoyed the antics of Mickey\n(apart from the money that is).
