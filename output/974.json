Imperial College Radio's other shortlisted award came via\nChris Riley. Mr Riley is one of\nthree vying for the award of Best\nStudent Broadcaster which also\ncomes with prize money of \u00a3250.\nChris Riley, has contributed to\nFelix in the past and masterminded\na programme on IC Radio called\n'Mission Impossible', the aim of\nwhich was to provide a weekly\nscience related programme to the\nradio station's listener ship. Declan Curry, former IC Radio\nNews Editor, spoke to Felix. \"I am\ndelighted with the continuing\nsuccess of Mission Impossible.\nChris and the MSc Science\nCommunication team have done an\nincredible job. They are an\noutstanding example of what the\nstudent media can achieve.\"\nMr Curry also added, \"[Mission\nImpossible] have provided a service\nwhich I hope will continue under\nany government proposals..\"\nThe prizes are to be announced\non Saturday 16th October at the\nNUS Student Media conference.\nPeter Preston, Editor of The\nGuardian, will present the awards.\nThe other candidates shortlisted\nfor these two awards are:\nStudent Broadcast Media (\u00a3500)\nBloomsbury Television (University\nCollege, London)\nImperial College Radio (Imperial\nCollege, London)\nIZ Current Affairs (Leeds\nUniversity)\nLivewire 945 (East Anglia\nUniversity)\nRadio London (London College of\nPrinting)\nStudent Broadcaster (\u00a3250):\nStephen Beech (University Radio\nNottingham, Nottingham University\nSue Cain (Bloomsbury Television)\nChris Riley (Imperial College\nRadio, London)\nEducation Changes Crash!\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nThe Secretary of State for\nEducation, John Patten, has\nconfirmed his commitment to\nintroducing voluntary membership.\nAddressing the Tory Party\nConference in Blackpool this week,\nMr Patten said: \"Last year, I promised this conference that I would end the one remaining closed\nshop in this country - that of student\nunions. We said we would do it.\nAnd we will do it, very shortly, in\nthree ways: by the introduction of\nthe voluntary principle as the basis\nof student union membership,\nthrough tough new Codes of\nPractice to prevent victim is ation and by putting an end to the scandal\nof taxpayers' money being used to\nfund political campaigns.\"\nHe also brings attention to the\npossible change in student\npopulation in a few years time:\n\"Over the next three years, a quarter\nof a million extra students will be\ngiven the chance to study and train\nat one of our 500 excellent further\neducation colleges, extending\nopportunities and meeting people's aspirations in a way not see since\nwe began the sale of council\nhouses.\"\nThe Department For Education\nis currently going through a period\nof consultation regarding voluntary\nmembership before the publication\nof a bill. The consultation period is\nset to end at the end of this month.\nMr Patten has also launched an\ninvestigation which is to consider\nthe introduction of a Super A A level grade. A spokesman for the\nDepartment For Education\nsaid,:\"This is just something that\nthe Secretary of State has asked for\nas an idea to be looked at...the top\nupper rank of the A level is to be\nlooked at. It is for those pupils of\nparticularly high abilities.\" The\ninquiry has been prompted after\nconcern at the number of students\nachieving very high grades at\nA level. This has caused some to\naccuse the Government of letting\nthe A level standard drop.\nThe investigation has caught\nsome university admissions tutors\nunawares. David Atkins, the\nAssistant Registrar at Imperial\nCollege, said: \"I have had no\nchance to consider it...and until the\nadmissions policy committee meet\nin November I will not be able to\nmake any comment.\"\nBY THE NEWS TEAM Imperial College Union's fleet of\nminibuses has been depleted after\none was written off over the\nsummer vacation.\nSome members of the Youth\nHostel Association, one of Imperial\nCollege Union's Recreational\nClubs, were on a tour to the Alps.\nHowever, near Dartmouth, the van\nspan and rolled down a major road.\nNo other vehicles were involved in\nthe accident.\nApparently, the only part of the\nminibus left undamaged was the\nfoot plate at the back.\nFour of the occupants were\ntaken to nearby hospitals but were\nlater discharged.\nYou can listen to IC Radio on 999AM in Southside Halls\n\n"

A place where you can watch performances by\nSteven Berkoff or The Doug Anthony Allstars,\nhear music by Sam Brown or The Honkin' Hep\nCats, see The Little Shop of Horrors or The\nMarvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ. From\nShakespeare for Breakfast to Sex After Supper,\nthe Edinburgh Festival Fringe has got it all.\nThis August marked the tenth anniversary of\nTheatre West End's participation on the Fringe\nwith three shows: Pinter's The Homecoming;\nCampion's Singing in the Wilderness and Can\nYou Hear the Music; plus our very own version\nof The Pied Piper.\nChamber Music\nAre you a musician Do you want to meet other\nmusicians? At the Chamber Music Society we\naim to provide a place for instrumentalists to\nmeet and singers to form small groups and make\nbeautiful music. We welcome any instruments\nand voices. If there are any budding conductors\nout there, you could even start a larger group,\nperhaps a flute choir or a brass ensemble. There\nwill be a concert at the end of term (7th December) so you can show off all your hard\nwork. So, whatever your instrument or musical\ninterest, come to our first meeting on Friday 8th October at 7pm10 pm in the Read Lecture\nTheatre, Sherfield Building, and bring the tools\nof your trade. For further details, please contact\nKim Dyos, Materials PG ext 6018.\nChicago Show\nIf you missed us at Freshers' Fair but would\nlike to join in, come along to some of our events.\nThe preparations for our major show,\nChicago start on Monday 11th October at\n7.30pm in the Union Concert Hall with a sing\nthrough and introductions to the show followed\nby a cold drink or three in the bar. All you need\nto bring along are a set of vocal chords\n(preferably your own) and with no auditions for\nthe chorus you don't even need to be able to\nsing! If you do feel yourself to be a budding\nstarlet auditions are 16th and 17th October.\nAs for what happens when a show's actually\nstaged, Opposites Attract is a must for\ndiscovering all the aspects of OpSoc from\ncostumes and make-up to rigging and set\nbuilding. The fun all starts at 2pm on Saturday\n16th October in the J CR and continues on\nSunday 17th at 1pm in the Union Concert Hall.\nAll this is rounded off with the one off\nperformance of Opposites Attract followed by\nthe New Year Party on Monday 18th October in\nthe Union Concert Hall.\nKeep an eye on the Diary section of Felix for\nother OpSoc dates.\nEach show was produced, directed and\nperformed by Imperial College students; we\neven built the theatre which housed them. This\nyear, we were host to the Guardian International\nStudent Drama Award winners, the Cambridge\nMummers. Our own shows were also well\nreceived, with large audiences and good reviews.\nWorking in the theatre was fun, whether it\ninvolved constructing the stage, making props,\nworking in the Box Office, building the Box\nOffice or being on Front Of House. Once the\nfestival had begun, only a few hours a day were\nspent working at the venue, leaving the rest of\nthe day free. As Fringe performers, we joined\nthe Fringe Club (aka the Edinburgh University\nStudents' Union) which offered free bands and\ncabaret, had three bars and didn't stop serving\ndrinks until three o 'clock in the morning!\nIf you are interested in becoming involved\nwith Theatre West End, you can find us in the\nDramSoc Storeroom in the Union Building\nevery lunchtime, or come to the DramSoc party\non Sunday in the Concert Hall. Do not worry if\nyou have had no experience, performing at the\nEdinburgh Festival is an opportunity you are\nunlikely to have had before and almost certainly\nwill not get again. We are always willing to take\nanyone with little or no knowledge of theatre\nwork.\n1 4 th October The Smashing Pumpkins' latest album is reviewed on page 6\n\n"

The\nEvolution Theory is still a theory, even some\nrecent scientists have evidence to refute it. Many\nreligions, ideologies, philosophies are believed\nby people despite the numerous contradictions\npresent within them.\nHowever, Islam is different. It has definite\nproof that the Qur'an is the word of God, that\nGod exists and that the Prophet Muhammad was\nthe messenger of God. I welcome anyone to\ndiscuss these issues and invite anyone to try and\ndisprove the truth of Islam.\nMany people look at the media's portrayal of\nIslam but one can only find out about Islam by\nspeaking to Muslims or by looking at the\nsources of Islam.

What I would like to point out is the\nnumber of inaccuracies in it. I was never once at\nchurch taught about the tooth fairy or Santa\nClaus, neither is this in the Bible, surprise,\nsurprise. Christmas to me is an important time to\nspend with family, who get together from all\nover the country. I do go to church on December\n25th, and spend lots of time thinking about its\nsignificance, but a more important date in the\nChristian calendar is Easter, remembering the\ndeath and resurrection of Jesus. No one is saying\nthat these are the exact anniversaries, we don't Offensive\nReview\nDear Miss Land,\nI think it is absolutely reprehensible that a paper such as yours representing the students of\nthis college with its international community\nshould publish an offensive, racist remark in the\nbook review section of Felix (4.10.93). The\nbook I am referring to is the Little Country by\nCharles De Lint, a Canadian shock horror! The\nquotation by our astute book critic, Tony Grew,\nwhich shows up his plain ignorance and\npossible jealously, nay probably, of other\ncultures in this excuse for a review are the\nwords 'pretentious' and 'shite' in reference to\nthe fact that he is a 'practising Celtic musician'.\nThere are many Celtic musicians in this city\nand their music is anything but 'shite' they add\nlife and soul to a grey, sombre, impersonal city.\nAlso there must be plenty of other Celtic\nstudents in this College who feel much\naggrieved and disgusted at this shallow and pig-ignorant remark.\nOn the subject of the book he gives us\nprecious little about the content. He claims he\nmuddled through the 650-odd pages just for our\nbenefit, it looks like he could not muddle\nthrough a Ladybird book let alone a smaller-sized novel.\nYours sincerely,\nJames Lynch, PG Year 1.\nSouthside Shop will\nbe open on Sunday\nfrom 10am to 2pm for the convenience\nof the hall residents\nknow, but it is helpful to have a focal time for\neach event.\nIf I had handed out leaflets from the\nChaplaincy stall that had stated as blatantly that\nall muslims were wrong about an aspect of their\nfaith I would have been in trouble. This was a leaflet that was full of so-called facts and\ninsinuations to make itself look more credible,\nwhich on further reading proves to be far from\nthe truth. I hope that the Islamic Society (I assume it was them as the leaflet was unsigned)\nwill become more tolerant of other faiths, and\ntry and use positive methods to sway people\nrather than negative.\nYours sincerely,\nLaura Burgess, Geology 2.\nCollege Summer\nAccommodation Fiasco\nCommercialised Christmas?\nThe deadline for letters is Monday, 6pm "

Janet Smith, Haldane Librarian,\nanswers all your burning questions below. Well, she covers the subject of\nbooks pretty thoroughly anyway...\nThe reading area inside the Haldane Library\nHumanities and Recreation at Imperial\nNew students may not have realised that one of\nthe advantages of Imperial is its excellent range\nof recreational and cultural activities, which are\nbacked up by corresponding library facilities.\nThe Haldane Collection, which is now part of\nthe Central Library, has a history dating to the\nearly part of this century, when HG Wells urged\nstudents \"to show that they were not barbarians\".\nA literary collection was set up by the\nStudent Union, and in the 1950s, its scope was\nwidened to provide for the courses taught in\nwhat is now known as the Humanities\nProgramme. Consequently, Imperial College has\na wide ranging collection of humanities and\ngeneral reading material (about 35,000 books\nwith 70 newspaper and periodical subscriptions)\nas well as a music collection including 10,000\nsound recordings.\nImperial College's commitment to liberal\neducation is evident from the naming of the\ncollection in honour of RB Haldane, statesman,\nphilosopher and education a list, who helped\nbring about the merger of Imperial College's constituent colleges. His is the rather dark\nportrait that adds some historical atmosphere to\nthe otherwise modern and informal reading area.\nThe Contents\nThe Haldane aims to cater for all tastes - from\nAristotle to Amateur Photographer - and the best\nway to discover its diversity is to come and see.\nThere are good collections on history, politics,\ntravel, biography, music, art, philosophy, and\nliterature, and well-used sections on consumer\nmatters, sport, genealogy, transport, religion, and\nhumour. Browsing will uncover specialities or\ncuriosities from giants to Egyptian grammar.\nThere is a wide range of fiction, popular authors\nincluding Umberto Eco, Ruth Rendell, and Tom\nWolfe. The fiction collection is financed by the\nStudent Union and usually selected by a student\nbuyer.\nDaily newspapers (The Times, Financial\nTimes, Guardian, Independent, Telegraph, Le\nMonde, Frankfurter Allgemeine) are taken, as\nwell as a wide range of magazines and\nperiodicals (including Autocar and Motor,\nPrivate Eye, Newsweek, Great Outdoors and\nWhich?), some of them subscribed to by the\nStudent Union. Some periodicals support taught\ncourses, notably history journals, Stern and\nL 'Express.\nThere are Ordnance Survey and other maps,\natlases and a good reference collection. The\nlibrary also receives a selection of publicity for\ntheatres, concert halls and other events in\nLondon.\nMusic and Sound Recordings\nThe Student Union also finances and selects a collection of jazz, folk, and pop recordings on\ncassette and compact disc. The strength of the\nclassical music collection (which includes\nprinted music, especially chamber music parts,\nvocal scores, and miniature scores) lies in the\nrecordings collection of CDs, cassettes and LPs.\nThis aims to satisfy the more experienced\nlistener, as well as to stimulate the new. Those\nwho imagine all classical composers to be dull\nand proper should try our first CD to arrive with\na parental guidance sticker, The Art of Bawdy\nSong (lots of Purcell)!\nThere is a good range of language courses on\ncassette, as well as some spoken word\nrecordings, including Shakespeare.\nCultural Events\nThe Haldane has hosted poetry and novel\nreadings in the past, and a varied programme of\nevents is planned for this year. On 3rd November at 5.30pm there will be an excellent\nopportunity to get to know one of our closest\nneighbours, the National Sound Archive, when\nTimothy Day will introduce some of the\nrecorded treasures from the Archive's collections. In addition, the 1890s Society will\nbe welcome. The first of these will be a talk by\nDr G Krishnamurti, 'Books Illustrators of the\n1890s' on 27th October at 7pm, which will be\naccompanied by an exhibition from 4th to 29th October. On November 24th, Michael Holroyd\nwill speak on 'The Ethics of Biography' at 7pm and we look forward to other 1890s Society\nevents in the spring and summer terms.\nWhereabouts and Opening Hours\nThe Haldane Collection has recently been\nrelocated to Level 1 of the Central Library, and\nis easy to spot from the Queen's Lawn. It has the\nsame opening hours as the Central Library (for\ndetails see library entrance) including evenings\nand Saturdays during term. It is open to all\nmembers of Imperial College and most of its\ncontents can be borrowed using the Central\nLibrary ticket.\nAnd Finally...\nWe welcome new users, and encourage you to\nmake suggestions for purchase. We also hope\nthat you will bring your enquiries; library staff\nlike to be challenged, so please fire your\nquestions, whether you want a list of the last\ndecade's Oscar winners, you cannot remember\nwho said \"Many people would sooner die than\nthink\" or if you hope to find a publication\ncontaining viola music by Monsieur de\nSaint-Colombe. The Haldane staff are Janet\nSmith, Jane Agnew, and David Lascelles. We\nlook forward to meeting you\nJanet Smith\nHaldane Librarian\nThe Young Americans is reviewed on page 8\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 9\nThe Rape of\nLucretia\nBritten's powerful and intimate opera, The Rape\nof Lucretia, was not meant for theatres as large\nas the Coliseum, where it's being revived by\nENO. Only the centre of the stage is used; the\nset, a moveable gantry surmounting two pairs of\nsliding screens, evokes Changi jail more than it\ndoes ancient Rome. The minimalist production\nfocuses one's attention entirely on the\nperformers, and a few minor shortcomings are\nenough to prevent the first act taking full flight:\nKim Begley, in the role of the Male Chorus,\nhas a fine and clear voice, but fails to illuminate\nthe text as Peter Pears does for the composer's Decca recording. As Collatinus, Lucretia's husband, Richard Van Allan is a dignified and\nimposing presence, but his gravelly voice robs\n'Those Who Love' of its magic. And the linen-folding scene is just not relaxed and quiet\nenough - here as elsewhere, Yvonne Barclay's Lucia has the notes, but her vibrato is\nindiscriminate and inappropriate.\nBut these are merely critic's carping s, and all\nsuch pedantic objections weigh as nothing\nagainst the magnificence of Jean Rigby's Lucretia in Act II; her rich, dark mezzo,\nspontaneous colouring of words and dramatic\ninvolvement make for a portrayal of almost\nunbearable intensity. The final scene is\nprofoundly moving.\nEarlier, Peter Coleman-Wright has given us\nan unpleasant and fascinating Tarquinius, both\nlyrical would-be seducer and spoiled, vengeful\n\u2022 I child (how he was wasted in 'Inquest of Love';\nI await his Onegin with interest). Conductor\nDavid Parry's account of the score is revealing ly detailed and, from the lush and pregnant 'sleep'\ninterlude to the tragic finale, wholly engrossing.\nPatrick Wood\nAt the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, at 7.30 pm\non the 8th,11 th,14 th and 21st of October. Box\noffice (071) 836 3161; tickets from \u00a36 on the\nday.\nCzech Festival\nThe South Bank Centre's Czech Festival, and\ntheir International Orchestra Season, opened last\nSaturday with Smetana'sMa Vlast. This great\ncycle of six interconnected tone-poems\ncelebrating the Czech nation was receiving its\nfirst performance in the Royal Festival Hall. Not\nsurprising, given that on every previous occasion\nwithin living memory that the Czech\nPhilharmonic Orchestra have visited London,\nthey've played Dvorak's 'New World' Symphony. Well, I'm exaggerating (slightly),\nbut it's certainly true that since being pipped at\nthe post for the Hovis contract, Smetana has\nremained in the shadow of his younger\ncompatriot. It was doubly refreshing therefore to\nbe able to experience this rich and colourful\nwork in its entirety, and to hear a visiting\norchestra venture from the beaten track. A glance at the forthcoming programmes of other\ntouring bands shows how rare this is:\nSymphonie Fantastique, Heldenleben,\nTchaikovsky 5, the list goes on, so many\nstandards, it begins to look like the Trooping of\nthe Colour. The reply to this is, I suppose, that\nthe best way to gain an idea of the differing\nstyles of various orchestras is to hear them in\nfamiliar repertoire.\nPrior encounters with Ma Vlast would not\nhave been necessary in order to appreciate the\nclass of the Czech players, and of the strings in\nparticular. It was in the third piece, 'Sarka', that\nthe previously undemonstrative conductor Jiri\nBelohlavek began to break sweat, urging his\nviolins to heights of incisive virtuosity. This\nmovement depicts the legend of the rebel queen\nSarka, who by her feminine wiles lures a band of\nmen into the clutches of her Amazon warriors,\nby whom they are then horribly slaughtered. The\nmusic is correspondingly vivid. Throughout the\nwhole work, Belohlavek's approach was\nun self conscious; climaxes were carefully\ngraded, with a Rolls-Royce brass section making\ntheir mark without swamping the texture.\nIt's probably because of musical politics that\nthis Czech Festival does not, technically, include\nthe Czech PO's Barbican concerts (last week), or\nthe Chamber Orchestra of Europe's Dvorak\nconcerts at the same venue later this month.\nWithout these, the Festival's list of only four,\nalbeit eclectic, orchestral programmes begins to\nlook a bit stingy - just one symphony each from\nDvorak and Martinu. The two remaining\norchestral concerts feature the LPO under\nBelohlavek in programmes including Martinu's Sixth Symphony (19th October) and Janacek's awesome Glagolitic Mass (26th October).\nChamber music is better served, with visits from\nthree Czech ensembles, and Dvorak and Janacek\n(String Quartet No. 1) from the Alban Berg\nQuartet (24th October).\nPatrick Wood\nThe Czech Festival continues until 26th October\nat the South Bank Centre. Box Office (071) 928\n8800. At the Barbican, the COE under Libor\nPesek play Dvorak's7 th Symphony on 11th October, and his 5th Symphony on 13th October.\nStudent discounts are available at both venues.\nFancy a bit of singing and acting - article on page 14\n\n"

    "content": "6 Reviews\nmt tko am Smashing Pumpkins\nSiamese Dream\nThe Breeders\nLast Splash\nThe Breeders - looking for a David Hockney\nMany years ago an album came out\nincorporating the best of the Throwing Muses\nand the Pixies. Energy, drifting vocals,\nthumping grungy guitars. That album was 'Pod'\nby The Breeders. 1993 brings their latest\noffering 'Last Splash', and I'm not impressed.\nThe whole album is lacklustre and plods along.\nAltogether they sound bored with the whole\nthing. They still sound like the Throwing Muses\nmore than they do the Pixies, and the basic\ningredients haven't changed. Something is\nmissing though, and it's that unidentifiable\nsomething that makes the difference between a mediocre album and a brilliant one. This is not\n'Pod', it's not even much of a Splash. On the\nother hand, maybe I'm just getting old. (7)\nRachel\nReleased on 4AD Intastella\nDrifter\nWhat difference does a Happy Monday make?\nWell, after the forgetfulness induced by\n'Drifter', in the Shaun Ryder featured 'Can You\nFly Like You Mean It?' some welcome urban\nbrashness comes out to play. Are these two\nrelated? Probably not as Shaun's involvement is\npretty minimal, being only some transparent\nsounding background vocals. The man himself\nmay well be a drugged out old sad-o, let's just\nthank Intastella for their charity and with NME hope that more bands get involved in the 'adopt-a destitute-singer' scheme.\nTintin\nReleased on Planet 3\nFollowing their acclaimed debut 'Gish' and use\nof producer Butch Vig, the Smashing Pumpkins\nwere always likely to be the square peg forced\ninto the round hole labelled 'Next Nirvana\nThing'. Yet 'Siamese Dream' is too peculiar for\neasy MTV rotation and the Pumpkins\nthemselves are no corporate rock whores.\nThe feel of 'Siamese Dream' is of the\nprogressive rock concept album which is why\nit's said you can't hum any of their songs. That\nmay be true for 'Gish' but the current single\nsuccess of 'Cherub Rock' and 'Today' would\nsuggest otherwise. Rather it's the quality of craft\nRevolting\nCocks\nLinger Fickin Good\nDespite the recent popularity of 'industrial\nmusic' and the subsequent deification of RevCo\nhead manAl Jourgensen (also Ministry), it\nseems that the new album is a backlash against\nthat genre of music.\nThe opening track ' Gila Copter' is a sample th on over which acid-guru Timothy\nLeary narrates. It is probably intended to\nprovoke extreme emotions or reactions, but on\nrepeated playing it is an incessant drove. Still,\noccasionally they hit the targets as with the\noutrageous Rod Stewart cover 'Do Ya Think\nI'm Sexy'. RevCo aren't short of ideas, they\nstretch them to the limit and it ends up an\nindistinguishable mass. (7)\nBratt Anderson\nReleased on Devotion\nMother Earth\nGrow Your Own\nA slow jazzy t waggle lopes over the horizon\nlike the lazy summer afternoons we've left\nbehind. Electric guitars swing in through the\nclouds and provide some extra wave y energy,\nbut really who cares? Down goes another half\nmixed cocktail of laid back coolness.\nTintin\nReleased on Acid Jazz\nwhich is evident. You could describe some of\nthese tracks as instrumentals without vocals, the\nmost noticeable trademarks being the long\nhaunting intros. They suggest early purpose and\nconfidence even before we hunker down to the\nactual gut work. For example, the swaggered\npower of 'Hummer' is all the more startling\nbecause of the opening fragility. 'Rocket' drops\na shoulder and swerves into a play sound of buzz\nguitars; its deep wrenching theme \"I shall be\nfree\", in a rocking world at least. 'Soma' reveals\na pulsating song where time brings the\ncharacteristic guitar explosion. We're taken to\nthe edge of screaming raw it y and dragged back\nstill screaming into solitude. 'Spaceboy' is a lament. But a lament to what? As with most of\n'Siamese Dream' you don't really know. Billy\nCorgan's not so much ramming down our\nthroats as letting us uncork our own bottles.\nWe end on 'Luna', which is psychedelia for\nthe 1990s. Our trip has landed safety. After the\nemotional out casting which has preceded, Billy\ntakes us to his recent marriage with a whisper of\n\"I'm in love with you\". Superslut to Cherubit's enough to make a grown man dream. (9)\nTintin\nReleased on Hut Records\ni in Paul Weller\nWildwood\nWhile it's not his fault, Paul Weller is generally\nviewed with the dreary suspicion afforded to a ex-political iconoclast. There was angry\ncredibility in The Jam but it got diluted by\nassociation with The Style Council and\nespecially the ill-founded Red Wedge.\nStill, on his second solo album there is the\nrich feeling of a rebirth. The shiny territory of\nthe 1980s has been replaced in an organic\nawakening, both in song theme and choice of\ninstruments. It's not really retro though, the use\nof wu rlitz er, melle tron, moog and sty lo phone are all built into a contemporary fabric of\nreminiscence. This is a man asking questions of\nhimself as in the pointed 'Has My Fire Really\nGone Out?' and complete with pumping strut ful boogie in 'Can You Heal Us? (Holy Man)'.\nWhilst other highlights of the rustic slice are the\nmore straightforward rock of \"The Weaver' and\nthe open fields of 'Shadow Of The Sun' the\nwhole album is not fully focused. Still Paul\nWeller is back with careless regard, but\ncontinuing to plough his own furrow. (6)\nTintin\nReleased on Go! Discs\nRead all about the Haldane Library on page 16\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 13\nClubs & Societies Column\nby Charlie Leary, Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\nThe coming week will see most clubs and\nsocieties starting their activities programme.\nMany offer a Freshers Buffet at lunchtime where\nyou can find out more about what they do and\nget a chance to meet the members of that\nsociety. At Freshers Fair you will have signed up\nwith the ones you are interested in and they will\nbe sending details of their meetings through your\ndepartment pigeon holes.\nNo club is allowed to take money at Freshers\nFair, they can only get people to sign up. This\nmeans that you can find out about that society\nboth by what you are told at Freshers Fair and by\nattending the first club function. Then it is up to\nyou whether you like what you see and you want\nto join. Most clubs cost less than \u00a310 to join for\nthe year so it is not an enormous amount to pay\nfor any activity.\nThere are two new clubs setting up that will\nnot be at Freshers Fair. One is the Yoga Club,\nthe other is the Transcendental Meditation\nSociety. Both have people willing to organise\nthe meetings and events, but they need twenty\nsignatures of people wanting to join. There are\nlists in the Union Office, so if you are interested\nin joining either of these then please come in and\nsign up.\nTranscendental meditation TM is a simple,\nnatural and effortless mental technique that\nenables the mind and body to attain deep rest.\nOver 550 scientific studies have shown TM to be\nan effective technique for stress reduction.\nDecreased metabolic rate, heart rate and breath\nrate are immediately measurable physical\nbenefits. Scientific studies have shown TM to be\nremarkably effective in widening the use of our\nmental potential. A free introductory talk will be\nheld in the Brown Committee Room, level 3,\nStudents Union Building on Thursday October\n14 at 7:30pm. The Yoga Club want to set up weekly classes\nboth for the beginner and the more experienced.\nThe club will also provide a good social\nenvironment for like minded people as well as the\nclasses themselves. As a club starting up the\nmembership will decide how the club operates\nso it is an excellent opportunity to have a hand in\nshaping a new Union Society.\nOne of the longest established societies,\nDramatic Society, have been exceptionally busy\nover the past week. They are the unsung heroes\nof the Carnival and Freshers Ball, having\nworked above and beyond the call of duty\nrigging the lighting for these events and\nTiddlywinking and\nTiddlydrinking\nNow that your first week of the new term at\ncollege is nearly over, what better way to spend\nthe weekend than going out and discovering a bit of London with your new found friends. The\nbest way to do this is with RAG. Come and\ntid d ly wink down Oxford Street with hundreds of\nother crazy students and raise loads of money\nfor Action Aid whilst having fun.\nAfter this we all go off to a pub the name of\nwhich will be withheld until the last possible\nmoment - to partake in the ultimate student\nchallenge: Drink-a pub-dry! This involves all\nthe day's collectors descending upon this\ninnocent pub with the intention of emptying all\nbottles (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and\nshutting off all the taps. Last year we managed\nto empty most of the barrels at the but we can\nbeat that and do better, so come along and join\nin, if you don't you'll regret it.\nAlso this year the event to get involved in\n(apart from RAG Week) is the inter-hall\ncompetition. This gives you a chance to win a barrel of beer for your hall team. The hall that\nraised the most money per resident wins this\namazing event and the envy of all the other\nhalls.\nSo, importantly, come to Tiddlywinks\ntomorrow, Saturday 9th. Sign in at your C CU offices at 10.15am. If you don't you'll get\nwoken up by 'Wakey, Wakey Southside'. Then\nat 2.30pm you'll get whisked off to a secret\ndestination to meet people and drink lots.\nSee you there.\nJane, RAG Chair\nMake The Connection\nThe Pimlico Connection is a tutoring scheme\nwhere students act as volunteer tutors in local\nprimary and secondary schools. The tutoring\nidea aims to solve one of Britain's biggest\neducational problems, that of low ambition\namong teenagers. Tutoring is also seen as a method of promoting science and technology, of\nencouraging pupils to get more out of education,\nand to stay on in education after sixteen.\nBy joining the scheme, you would be helping\nothers to learn and learn yourself about working\nwith others, communication and science.\nLast year saw an exciting new development\ninvolving the use of student interpreters at the\nScience Museum. With a grant from the Nuffield\nFoundation, the initiative should expand during\n1993/94 to include more students and schools\nfrom across London.\nIf you would like to get involved then come\nalong to one of the no obligation briefing\nsessions below or to one of the training sessions\nwhich are necessary before you start tutoring.\noperating it on the night. All to often jobs like\nthis go without recognition, but without their\nhelp these events would probably never happen.\nMany thanks must go to Andrew Nu for\ncoordinating the whole thing and to the rest of\nthe Dramsoc Crew for their work. The\nentertainments throughout Freshers Week were\nbooked and coordinated by Ents. Many thanks to\nall the people who helped out with those events.\nDramsoc will be performing their first play of\nthe year towards the end of this term. They\nperform these shows ontop of all the work they\ndo in conjunction with Ents and the gigs in the\nLounge with Jazz & Rock. They are always on\nthe lookout for new recruits to help with both the\ntechnical and performance sides. Don't worry if\nyou have no experience, most people start off\nthat way and the more experienced members are\nmore than willing to teach the new recruits.\nThis column in Felix will feature what's going on in the clubs and societies world\nthroughout the year. If you have not signed up at\nFreshers Fair then it is still not too late.

    "content": "Feature 15\nDon't watch that, watch this!\nTony Grew guides you through the autumn releases and helps you choose\nfilm of your dreams.\nWell children, here we are again. Another wet\nand horrible term. What, I hear you ask\nyourselves, what, you cry as you dribble into the\near of your new friend in the Union bar and take\nanother drag of that funny cigarette, which is\nquite pleasant really, what is there to do in this\ngod-awful place?\nThere are many things which a consenting\nadult and the animal of his choice can do to wile\naway those lonely winter afternoons, but several\nacts of Parliament forbid me to guide you\nthrough the more exciting possibilities.\nSuddenly it comes to you in a vision as you\nspew the last of your guts into the toilet. The\ncinema! That's it! It's warm and dry and the\nseats are better for dozing than the ones in the\nlibrary. But what to see I hear you cry. Well, I can help you there children. Are you sitting\ncomfortably? Then we'll begin.\nTony Scott, the man behind such classics as\nTop Gun and The Last Boy Scout is back with a new thriller written by Reservoir Dogs director\nQuentin Tarrantino. In True Romance Christian\nSlater and Patricia Arquette star as newly-weds\nwho decide to honeymoon and smuggle drugs at\nthe same time. The suitably confused plot then\nhas them pursued by every sadistic bastard\ncurrently working in Hollywood, including\nDennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary\nOldman and Val Kilmer.\nAltogether more light-hearted is Robin Hood, Men in Tights, Mel Brooks' satire on the\nvomit o us Kevin 'thought it was neat' Costner\nhistory re-write of a similar title, which deserves\nridicule if only for being the reason Bryan\nAdams once again became socially acceptable.\nThat film was so noble and nice and politically\ncorrect, and our Kev was so very predictable in\nthe lead, that I kept on expecting him to build a baseball field or try and nail Capone. Anyway,\nhe is well and truly lampooned here, with the\nexcellent Cary Elwes in the tights and fighting\nevil on all sides with not a hair out of place.\nSean Connery is back on form starring as a wise and wily cop in Rising Sun, a thriller about\na murder in a Japanese company. He is teamed\nwith the decidedly Japan-bashing Wesley\nSnipes. These are the sort of parts being turned\ndown by Clint since Unforgiven, the western for\nmen who like to get in touch with their feminine\nside, but yet again Sean excels, not even\nbothering with an accent or anything as pon cy as\nthat. What a guy.\nAlso of interest to the more action-oriented of\nyou may be Demolition Man, with Stallone and\nSnipes as cop and robber frozen in time and then\naccidentally released into the crime-free Los\nAngeles of 2032 (yeah, right). The screenplay is\nfrom the writer of Heathers and Batman Returns\nand is apparently very exciting, if a little weird. I mean, how does he think of these things, and\ndoesn't the medication help?\nThere is always Dave, which stars Kevin\nKevin Costner, who isn't starring in Robin Hood, Men in Tights\nKline as a man who looks exactly like the US\npresident. It could be worse. You could be a man\nwho looks like his daughter. Many boxers do\nafter a few years. Basically he stands in when\nthe Chief is indisposed and starts to try and\nchange things. Sigourney Weaver is the First\nLady.\nIf you think that sounds unlikely, try and\nwork out the plot of Coneheads, which\napparently concerns the life of a normal family\nall of whose heads are conical. It stars Dan\nAykroyd and Jane Curtin, who is rumoured to\nhave been one of Kate and Allie, but no-one can\nremember which. Or maybe nobody wants to\nadmit to watching it. The idea comes from an\nold Saturday Night Live sketch, which is the\nplace that launched the short career of Mike\nMyers, better known as Wayne. I say short\nbecause his latest offering is bound to ensure he\nnever works again. It goes by the name of So I Married an Axe Murderer and judging by its\nbox office takings I 'll bet he wished he had done\njust that.\nThere are some more sublime offerings in\nstore for those of you who are that way inclined,\nthough at a good science college like this you\nshould be ashamed of yourself, notably the long-delayed Age of Innocence. Directed by Martin\nScorcese, this adaptation of the classic novel set\nin the polite society of 1870s New York is being\ntipped for Oscars even before its release. The\nfact that the stars are easy on the eye can't hurt\nthe film either, with Michelle Pfieffer and Daniel\nDay Lewis in the lead roles. We also have the\nnew Merchant-Ivory film Remains of the Day\non its way, starring the great luv vies of the\nmodern cinema Tony Hopkins and Em Thompson. And apparently Superman is in it\ntoo, but hopefully he will be dressed more\ntastefully on this occasion.\nThe young and acclaimed director of the\n1991 smash Boyz 'n' the Hood has seemingly\noutdone himself with his second feature Poetic\nJustice, which stars Janet Jackson as a hairdresser-poet looking for love in the ghetto.\nOn a similar theme the Hughes brothers' debut\nMenace II Society has also been praised, and\nwill appear as part of the London Film Festival,\nrunning from 4th to 21st of November this year\nand is well worth a look.\nI was going to mention Kalifornia but I don't approve of the spelling and anyway it's got the\nprofessionally ugly Juliette Lewis in it and I know how much she can upset some people's stomachs. So instead I will warn you against the\nimminent arrival of Look Who's Talking Now.\nYou are advised to take evasive action\nimmediately.\nMusic reviews can be found on pages 6 and 7\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nDear Fresher...\nJohn Simpson, Director of the Imperial College Careers Service, welcomes\nyou to Imperial College and gives you some ideas for your own self-development.\nWelcome to Imperial College. The next three or\nfour years should be among the most interesting\nand enjoyable in your life, provided you make\nthe most of the opportunities available at\nCollege.\nYou can probably\nrecall one of the\nsignificant steps in your\nlife when you entered the\nsixth form. Coming to\ncollege is an even more\nsignificant step. You have\nmore freedom, more\nindependence and more\nopportunities to do your\nown thing and to succeed\nor fail. If you do not\nmake some mistakes you will not have learned\nanything. Learning from one's own mistakes is\nan important part of experience, but don't waste\ntime re-inventing everything. Instead build on\nthe experience of others, take advice (it's usually\nfree), ignore some of it, test it out, accept it or\nreject it.\nYou have already demonstrated some\nplanning ability by passing ' A' Levels (or their\nequivalent) sufficiently well to be at College.\nHow are you going to plan the next three, four or\nsix years? And I'm not talking just about your\nacademic studies, I'm talking about the start of\nthe rest of your life.\nWhat do you want to achieve this term?\nMaking friends is usually high on most people's list. How? Join clubs and societies, attend\nmeetings, take up a new sport, develop your\ninterest. Any of these are likely to bring you into\ncontact with like-minded students. And there's always the bar to prop up while seeking\ninspiration.\nBy the end of the summer term in your first\nyear you will be feeling\nthe financial pressures of\ncollege. In other words\nyou're broke! So how\nabout earning some good\nmoney in the long\nvacation. If you leave job\nhunting until the vacation\nstarts you may be too\nlate. All the interesting\nand lucrative jobs have\nbeen filled already and\nyou will be lucky if the\nlocal council wants some grass cutting or the\ngarden centre needs a dirty pair of hands.\nIt's well worthwhile doing some preliminary\njob hunting between Christmas and Easter. Call\nin at the IC Careers Service (Room 310\nSherfield Building) where\nyou will find information\nabout vacation training.\nAlternatively write to\nemployers with your CV, call in to some local shops\nand hotels or see who's advertising in the local\npress.\nVacation jobs can be\nmost informative. Ideally\nthey give you the chance to try out some type of\nwork or future employer that interests you. They\ngive you experience in job hunting, letter writing\nand interviews, as well as a real insight into what\nit's like to work for a particular type of\nemployer. Some even pay you quite well. Jobs\nabroad are popular and early applications are\nessential. Start by visiting the IC Careers Service\nwhich has a good range of reference books and\naddresses.\nAt the start of the second year you raise your\nsights higher. Now is the time to test your skills\nin organising something - a social evening for\nyour department, looking after the finances of a society or become fixtures secretary of your\nclub. \"That sounds too much like hard work,\" I hear you say. Yes, it does take some effort on\nyour part but generally speaking the more effort\nyou put into something the more enjoyment you\nwill get out of it.\nCommittee work is excellent preparation for\nlife after college. You learn to set agendas, run\nmeetings, agree actions, persuade other students\nto do things, work within budgets and end up\nwith a successful event - a party, a visit, a play\nor a newspaper. (Think\nhow much effort went\ninto producing this\nedition of Felix).\nYou should start\nthinking seriously about\nyour future career before\nthe end of the second\nyear. Even if you haven'ta clue what you want to\ndo, that's no excuse for\ndelaying finding out about the possibilities. You\nare surrounded with sources of information:\nfriends, family, tutors, careers advisers, libraries.\nStart looking. It may be a long process but so is\nlife. So it really is worth spending more time\nthinking about your career than planning your\nnext weekend or holiday.\nThe IC Careers Service is a good starting\nplace. Pop in and speak to the information staff.\nFind out about ' PROSPECT' and all the\ninformation booklets and reference files.

    "content": "14 Clubs and Societies\nIntroducing the Japan Society\nWell, the time has arrived when once again you\nhave to decide which societies to choose from.\nSo here I am writing this article for our beloved\nFelix, trying to persuade you that our society is\nworth looking at.\nThe Japan Society exists for both Japanese\nstudents and those of other nationalities. Its main\naims are not only to unite the Japanese\ncommunity but also to introduce their culture to\nothers. Rather than trying to be really boring\nabout it, we will try to make it as fun and\ninteresting as possible. This is achieved by\norganising loads of social events, where\neverybody gets to meet everyone else in, not just\nour society, but other related societies.\nWe have already organised some of our\nevents and are still planning more. There is a social meeting every week, currently on\nWednesdays at 1pm in the Ante Room, level 1,\nSherfield Building, where anybody can turn up.\nIf you aren't sure where this is, ask us at the\nFreshers' Gathering (see later in the article). At\nthese meetings we do some boring things like\ndiscuss coming events and distribute recent\nJapanese newspapers (for anybody who can read\nthem), as well as some more interesting things\nlike discussing the latest gossip and making fun\nof certain committee members (especially me).\nThere will also be a regular newsletter, about\nevery two weeks, which will contain information\nabout coming events and numerous articles on\ninteresting facts about Japan and its culture.\nThis year, what is special about our society is\nthat we are in fact two societies. With the\ngrowing success of Japanese animation (anim6) and comics (manga) throughout the world, we\nhave decided to start our own Anime' and Manga\nclub within our society. If this is a success it will\nundoubtedly become its own society, but for the\nmoment it will be run by us.\nJapanese animation and comics are very\ndifferent from western style equivalents; they\ncan be more adult oriented, with deep story lines\nand vary from extremely cute to mega blood and\nguts, more often than tending towards the latter.\nThe Japanese Anime' and Manga society will\nbe holding approximately fortnightly showings\nof some of the latest and more popular Anim6,\nas well as obtaining information and gossip\nabout the latest releases from various sources.\nWe hope to also get hold of various new, as well\nas old, manga which will be distributed at our\nsocial gatherings. Currently this year's membership fee will be \u00a33.00 for both societies.\nThe Freshers' Gathering, the first event of the\nyear for Japan Society will take place on\nMonday 11th October in the Union Lounge from\n12pm2 pm. We hope to serve various samples of\nJapanese and non-Japanese food which we hope\nwill keep you happy for the rest of the day.\n(Details cannot be finalised until the Union\nmanagement gives us the go ahead!)\nThis event is the best opportunity to join the\nsociety, by simply paying the membership fee.\nWe will gladly answer any questions you have\nas well as give you our sample newsletter about\nthe different events we have already lined up,\nhow we operate and possible future events. We\ndon't bite, well not all of us anyway.\nSo, if you are able to find us, please feel\nwelcome to come and talk to us, and possibly\nbecome a member. You've got nothing to worry\nabout; except possibly our president, who has\nbeen known to nip people, especially non\nworking committee members!\nIf you've got any questions try e mailing (if\nyou know what that is) the president, Taiji, at\nto2@ doc.ic.ac.uk. or putting a note for the vice\npresident, Tomoko Isobe, in the Biology\npigeonhole in Beit Quad (on the right as you go\nthrough the archway.\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

Imperial College Union is not affiliated to the NUS.\n2. Almost every student union in the country is affiliated to the NUS.\nThe notes contain the facts relevant to the motion, background information really.\nImperial College Union believes:\n1. Being affiliated to the NUS offers national representation.\n2. Being affiliated offers students a wider variety of discount deals.\nThese are the reasons for raising the motion, in this case, the belief of better re pre se better discounts.\nImperial College Union resolves:\n1. That the Union should hold a campus wide referendum to decide whether to affiliate.\nThis will be the position that the Union will take if the motion is passed.\nImperial College Union Instructs:\nl. The Union Executive to organise campus wide referendum and to publicise the advantages and\ndisadvantages of affiliation.\nThis is how the motion or policy is to be turned into action, in this case by the Executive\nThat's the first week out of the way, only about\n30 more to go! I do hope that all of your\nFreshers week's dreams were granted and you\naren't too tired to face what's left of the year.\nAlways keep an eye out for events advertised in\nthe Felix, Union fliers and posters everywhere.\nApart from the social side that we've seen\nthis week, there is so much more on the\nrepresentation and governing parts of Imperial\nCollege Union than you would see in Freshers\nWeek.\nImperial College Union is governed by the\nGeneral Meeting of all it's members, that's you\nas students. At these meetings points are\ndebated, policy & aims are decided upon and\nmotions are passed. The policy passed at a Union General Meeting is then acted upon by\nthe Executive who will report back on their\nprogress at later Meetings. Also sabbaticals and\nother officers of the Union report on what\nthey've been up to, on the work in hand and\ntheir successes (hopefully!). This meeting\ncomes together every month at a date advertised,\nusually two weeks before, like the advert below.\nAny member of the Union can raise motions\nto be debated. But what's a motion, I hear you\ncry. If you've picked up the most excellent\nUnion handbook when you registered, you'll\nfind that there's one on page 31. If not, do not\nfret. For your delight and delectation, a sample\nmotion is shown in the box on the right. This\none is concerned with affiliation to the National\nUnion of Students (NUS). A 'running\ncommentary' explaining each bit is given in\nitalics underneath.\nHopefully this has made it understandable. If\nyou have any problems, just ask one of the\nsabbaticals. Remember that you'll find them in\nthe Union Offices in the Union Building, Beit\nQuad.\nAll motions have to be submitted to the\nUnion Office at least seven days before the\nGeneral Meeting is to be held.\nSee you then!\nN.B. In the past, there have been motions on\nevery subject under the sun, serious, frivolous or\ndown right silly. Keep your eyes peeled for the\nmotions going into the next General Meeting.\nUnion General Meeting\nFriday 22nd October,1pm JCR, Sherfield Building\nDeadlinefor motions: Friday 15 October.\nPlease hand all motions in at the Union office.\nElections Motions Debate\nTake your Union ID card if you want to vote at the UGM\n\n"

Gasps of amazement. I was born in\n1942, during what we Oldies call the Second\nWorld War. I first attended IC in 1960, finishing\nmy degree in Chem Eng in 1963. I stayed on to\ntake a PhD which I completed in 1966. I then\nmoved to North Carolina State University for a year to take some Industrial Engineering courses\nto prepare me for the transition to a job in my\nfamily's furniture manufacturing company.\nGasps of disbelief. After more than 25 years in\nbusiness I have returned to my alma mater for a bit of peace and quiet...er, I mean intellectual\nstimulation, in the form of an MSc in the History\nof Science, most of which, incidentally, seems to\nhave been written since I left college for the first\ntime.\nWhile I was at IC in the sixties, John F Kennedy was assassinated, Winston Churchill\ndied, The Beatles and the Rolling Stones had\ntheir first hits and the Labour Party won a general election...but not necessarily in that\norder. I queued all night for tickets to a Rolling\nStones concert in the Regent Ballroom in\nBrighton. At about the same time, I saw a young\nband called Status Quo who sounded promising\nin a rowdy sort of way, playing as the warm-up\ngroup to an outfit that never did make it...I can't remember their name. I married in 1963 and I Credits\nCollators, stickers of HJ B Cards and stuff ers of leaflets from last week:\nTim from Tizard, Mike Chamberlain, Penguin,\nJames Handley, Mellisa Ali, Greg lies, Jon\nJordan, Steve Newhouse.\nFor this issue:\nAndy Thompson, Rose Atkins, Penguin, Steve\nNewhouse, Simon Govier, Kamran Malik, Tony\nGrew, Owain Bennallack, Jon Jordan, Patrick\nWood, Rachel Mountford, Bratt Anderson, John\nSimpson, Janet Smith, John Westwater, Charlie\nLeary, Andrew Tseng, Alex Tavener.\nThanks from the President:\nCongratulations must go to Matt, Ents Chair, for\norganising this week and to all the Ents Crew\nfor all the work they did.

My elder daughter was at\nschool with the daughter of the keyboard player\nwith Led Zeppelin. Kiddies' birthday parties at\ntheir house were very musical, as I recall. Your\nreaders may have heard stories to the effect that\nthe sexual revolution of the sixties gave rise to\nwild excesses of promiscuity, debauchery and\nextravagance.

Upon later investigation it\nwas found that the man was in fact\nAfrican and not Turkish as he had\nclaimed. He has been released on\nbail pending further inquires.\nThe other incident concerned\nserious disturbances in Garden Hall.\nThese continued into the evening\nwith violent behaviour in the Union\nBuilding. The person allegedly\nresponsible is the subject of police\ninquires and college discipline.\nChocolate\nspeckling is caused by a fungus,\nch ry sopo rium far i nicola, which\nreaches cocoa beans from the soil\nand survives roasting, manufacturing and packaging.

    "content": "8 Reviews\nThe Young\nAmericans\nStarring: Harvey Keitel\nDirector:. Danny Cannon\nCrap appears to be the new movement in British\nfilm and at the start, The Young Americans\nappears to more than belong to this new wave. It\nadheres to every clich6 about gangsters and\nAmerican cops in the book and a few more\nwhich are under consideration for the next issue.\nSo, for example, we have the clean-cut kid\nwho has to balance loyalty with the public good,\nthe honest gangsters versus the evil American\ndrug-dealers, the cop who uses unconventional\nmethods to get the undoubted bad-guys and has\nmarital problems related to his work.\nYet when you sit back and enjoy the\nspectacle, you will realise that what you are\nlooking at is one of the most enterprising and\ntechnically assured debuts of recent years.\nThe plot is complicated and confusing, but it\nis worth the effort. A spate of gangland killings\nappear to have left Scotland Yard puzzled. Then\nDEA agent and all-round American hero John\nHarris (Harvey Keitel) arrives from Los Angeles\nas an adviser. He quickly becomes deeply\ninvolved in the case and when the two cops\nassigned to 'mind' him during his stay are\nShort films may not immediately appeal to you,\nunless you are under three feet tall of course.\nNow that we have got the very poor joke out\nof the way, we can get on to the serious business\nof short features, with many of the best in the\ngenre on show at the Barbican over the next\nweek. There are over 300 to choose from, with\nmany intriguing titles to choose from, among\nthem Vibroboy, The Bruce Diet and The\nKetchupped Family.\nThe best offering is a25 minute Scottish film\nstarring Richard E Grant and Phyllis Logan\n(who used to play Lady Jane in 'Lovejoy' but\nshe doesn't like to talk about it). Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life is a witty and refreshingly\nbizarre foray into the weird world of the famous\nsurrealist author. He is desperately trying to\nfinish the first sentence of his new novel\n'Metamorphosis' but he can't seem to find the\ninspiration he needs. Exacerbating the situation\nare a range of hilariously strange characters.\nAmong them are a psychotic butcher who has\nlost his pet cockroach and a flat full of dancing\nmaidens. This film can't be recommended\nhighly enough. It marks the directorial debut of\nbrutally murdered in front of him he vows to\nsolve the mystery.\nReluctantly helped by a young local boy,\nChristian, who hates the drug violence all around\nhim, he discovers that a local hood and nightclub\nowner is recruiting the young off the street to do\nhis dirty work. But all is not as it seems.\nMeanwhile Christian is in love.\nThis all culminates in the inevitable\nnail-biting conclusion, with Harris finding an\nunexpected ally.\nThere is nothing s uprising in the plot, but\nthen again there is no reason that there should\nbe. It is understandable that this film should\nhave received some criticism; after all, no-one\nPeter Capaldi, who also wrote the piece. Soft\nTop, Hard Shoulder, which he also wrote, won\nthe Audience Award at the London Film\nFestival last year and was widely critically\nacclaimed. Here he shows himself to be an\nexcellent director. The whole production is\ninfused with a professionalism and confidence\nsurprising when you learn it cost only \u00a330,000\nto make.\nOther highlights of the festival include A Sense Of History, a new short from 'Life Is\nSweet' director Mike Leigh, two from the\ncontroversial French director Cyril Collard and\ntwo films from this year's winner of the Camera\nD 'Or at Cannes, Tran Ahn Hung.\nPrizes are being awarded in several\ncategories by Time Out, the BBC and CIC,\nincluding a trip to LA to meet with producers for\nthe winner of the Best Production award.\nThe whole festival, which runs from 15th to\n21st of October at the Barbican cinemas is \u00a33\nadmission and the best night to go is the first\none. Several of the directors will be there and\nyou may even get to talk to some of them!\nTony\ncould claim it is perfect. Yet the sheer\nconfidence of the entire experience helped to\ncarry it off. Particular praise is due to the young\nleads, Craig Kelly and Thandie Newton, as well\nas the cinematographer Vernon Layton. His use\nof widescreen is both stylish and functional and\nLondon looks more real, up-front and beautiful\nthan I have ever seen it. The recreation of the\nclub scene is, admittedly haphazard, but then it\nis notoriously difficult to try and authentically\nreplicate an 'atmosphere'.\nSo, even though it is not flawless, The Young\nAmericans is well worth a look.\nTony\nYarrow - An\nAutumn Tale\nCharles de Lint\nThis book is described as a fantasy tale set in the\nmodern world. Basically, the heroine, Cat, lives\nin the modern world and dreams in a fantasy\nworld. Then someone comes along and steals\nher dreams. No dreams, no fantasy world - oh\ndear.\nSarcasm aside, this is not a particularly\ngripping book. This is the second book by this\nauthor reviewed by Felix (see Felix 973) and\ntwo separate reviewers can't be wrong. May I suggest you take up fishing, Mr Lint?\nIn case I haven't made it clear yet, don't bother buying this book!\nRachel\nPublished by: Pan\nPrice: \u00a34.99 (paperback)\nBritish Short Film Festival\nRead about what Theatre West End have been up to on page 12\n\n"
