On occasions I have been really terri f iii d, and\nnone more so than when we had\nthe \" snake man \" C.P. J. Ionides\nin the studio with some of his\nvenomous friends. He had them\nall in linen bags and we squatted\non the floor with a few feet between us in which he was to show\nthem off. On his head Ionides\nwore his battered old felt hat\u2014\n\" it's got enough dried venom in\nthere to kill an army.\"\nOne by one he produced the\nsnakes, a Gaboon Viper, the spitting cobra and aquatic snakes\nwhich he had caught by night in\nthe light of pressure lamps. By\nthe side of the camera a man was\nstanding with a syringe at the\nready. As one snake took the\nplace of another on that square\ngram me from Copennagen, Venice, Brussels, Geneva and Edinburgh and when the BBC electricians had a difference of opinion\nwith the management I presented\nit from a fire escape outside the\nstudio.

This amateurism\nwas at once put down to the fact\nthat the days of un rationed milk\nwere still to come.\nThe first Editorial stated the\nneed for a frequently published\njournal, insisted that Felix would\nnot devour Phoenix (despite their\n\" animal connections\") and\npointed out that copies for one\nterm cost less than a pint\u2014which\nthey still do!\nCORRESPONDENCE\nA glance at the first correspondence page should suffice to convince any would-be complainants\nof the futility of it all\u2014moans\nabout College \" hops\" from\n\" Wallflower \" and \" this strange\nbody of men who apparently find\nit necessary to operate pneumatic\ndrills at the ungodly hour of\n7.30 a.m\" and this;\nDear Sir,\nIn a mild sort of way I would\nlike to register a bitter protest\nabout the Union beer.\nPerhaps one of our own tame\nentomologists could recommend\nto our so called brewers a more\nvirile type of Gnat.\nYours etc.,\nUlcerated.\nHave wallflower and Ulcerated\ndone any good?\nFELIX SOBERS UP\nFelix ended its first life with\nthe publication of this \" comment \"\u2014\" When are you going to\nsqueeze the bear out of Felix?\"\nIt was said that previous i sues had\nmerely been \" concatenations of\naccounts of bi bulat ion.\" This was too much and after\nagain blaming the scarcity of\nmilk, Felix sobered up.

    "content": "2 FELIX EDITORIAL BIRTH OF A NEWSPAPER\nJust over fourteen years ago a competitor to the then major\nUnion Publication PHOENIX was introduced. Called Felix it was\nmeant to complement the above by reporting social and sporting\nevents of topical and general interest. The first issue in December\n1949 was of 600 copies which sold out before 10.00 a.m. on the\nfirst day ; subsequently 1,000 were printed. At that time FELIX was run by a highly enthusiastic group of people and printed\n(Roneo'd) in the books tall by Miss Larkom. Soon, however, the process was changed and a more sophisticated electrostatic method\ncapable of photographic reproduction was introduced.\nINDEPENDENT\nBy the 45th issue apathy and shortage of copy were making\nthemselves felt, and in 1953 a rival appeared in the shape of Sennet.\nBut FELIX recovered, and the standard of writing and production\nremained remarkably high. All this time the newspaper had run\nin a financially healthy, and solvent state with no grant from the\nUnion. In October '56 the then Editor wrote, \" As always FELIX is independent of financial support from the Union. Your Union\nCouncil cannot dictate to you through the paper.\"\nNEW PROCESS\nIt is not clear when FELIX first applied for a grant, but it is\nprobable that this be a me necessary in January '59, when the paper\nwas printed for the first time by the present process. We have been\nwith Wing Commander Garby and the West London Offset Co. ever\nsince and owe him much gratitude for help with layout and continued interest and encouragement; FELIX has changed greatly\nsince he first took it on, and he has alway- b? en keen and quick to\nsuggest improvements. The change to offset printing took much\nof the drudgery out of production and left the staff very much more\ntime for improved layout techniques and coverage of events.\nTHE ADVENT OF ADVERTISING REVENUE Over the next two or three years FELIX went through a succession of editors and a large portion of Union funds. It was usually\nan eight-page issue, but sometimes only six\u2014a notable exception was\na twelve-page sport issue which lost some th i~i like forty pounds. At\nthe beginning v of'62 is was decided by the executive that something\nshould be done to stem the mounting costs of production. Instead of\ntackling the problem from the revenue end they tried to cut costs\nby purchasing a Gestetner duplicator which never really.got going\n(but which is now used for the late news sheet). That same summer\nthe EDUCATIONAL PUBLICITY CO. were approached and asked\nwhether they would supply us with regular advertising. They have\ndone so ever since and have played the major part in enabling FELIX to continue in its present form. We are particularly grateful to\nMrs. J. Platford of the above who has helped us through many difficult situations. Well over half our revenue comes from this source\nand we are entirely dependent on them for our healthy financial state.\nA YEAR OF EXPANSION\nLast year established something of a record in that the Editor\nMr. Pawlowicz remained in office for the whole year and broke even\nfinancially at the end of it. On this firm and essential foundation\nthis year's policy of expansion has been built. We have a large staff\n(over 30 excluding sales girls), and each of the major positions on the\nstaff is duplicated by a student who (barring accidents) will be here\nnext year; this will ensure a smooth transition of staff over the\nsummer. The late news supplement has come into operation for the\nfirst time, and we also have our new black sales tins around the\nCollege. Issues have regularly been of ten or twelve pages, and the\nFreshers' issue a record fourteen. Financially we are healthy, and\nneither copy nor sales shows any signs of falling as they usually do\nat this time.\nFelix is rapidly becoming a newspaper, with enthusiasm and\nideas snowballing. The continuity of the process started 14 years\nago, and given new life in the last three, must be allowed to con-tin ue. Any break in this progression could bring Felix to its knees,\nand such a step would not be taken lightly. It is essential to the\nadvertisers in, to the readers of, and to the Union in which it is, that\nFelix does not cease publication.\nFESTIVAL HALL MIMICS\nREPULSED\nLast week 70 Regent Street\nPoly students battled with attendants and were thrown out, when\nthey tried /to raid the Festival\nHall. Their effort was an attempted copy of I.C.'s successful raid\nwhich raised \u00a366 last May.\nQuote\nOverheard at Square Dancing\nfrom one M.T. S.V.P. of South\nSide:\n\" If she was a little bit wicked it\nwould be bloody fabulous.\"\nI welcome the opportunity to\nsend greetings to \" Felix \" on the\noccasion of its 200th edition. An unbroken run from 1949 is no\nmean achievement amidst the\nperiodic crises which beset student\nnewspapers. From India I send\nmy best wishes for a vigorous and\nsuccessful future.\nPATRICK LINSTEAD\nRector.\nFELIX Chairman, Felix Board\nEditor\nProduction Manager\nSports Editor\nArt Director\nLate News Editor\nSales Manager ...\nAsst.

    "content": "FELIX11 BY FRANK HOBSON If you should be in the Union\nnext Saturday week do not be\nsurprised to find yourself surrounded by well over 500 lean\nand hungry athletes. They will\nhave come to take part in the\nHyde Park Road Relay\u2014I.C.'s event of the e yar. This year there will be nearly\n90 teams from Universities, Technical ,and Training Colleges 'as\nfar away as Glasgow, Edinburgh\nand Belfast. It is a major event in\nthe British athletics calendar with\ncoverage in the national and\nathletics press (and FELIX too!).\nOriginal Idea\nThat is the size of it now; this\nyear, in fact, it will be just ten\ntimes the initial (1949) size. The\noriginal idea came to three I.C. runners of that year\u2014Tony Watts\n(7 times I.C.440y ds champion\nand elected this year's Athletic\nClub's president), Bob Gigg (who\nran the fastest lap in that inaugural race), \\\\nd Alan Brown\u2014in\nthe gym showers after a training\nrun round the park, and indeed\ntheir enthusiasm must have\nseemed justified in that year for\nI.C. won the race from a field of\neight others. Not that such success was to last, for as the race\ngrew in size and reputation the\nstandard of competition rose with\nit, so that in the following year\nwe could do no better than 5th out of 12\u2014Battersea being the\nwinners.\nFamous Names\nBy 1954 the race was attracting\na record 27 teams including two\nor three Oxbridge colleges (thus\nmaking the event socially accept-able?). Also running in that year,\nfor the first time, was Martin\nHyman (Southampto/i)( at the\nvery Start of a running career\nwhich lead to international and\nOlympic appearances and the\nU.K.6 mile record.\nA feature of those early years,\nwas the appearance of non-scoring, impromptu teams, often\ncontaining famous runners who\nwere ineligible to represent any\ncollege team. In 1954 one such\nteam with two national (champions\u2014John Disley (U.K.) and D. Macmillan (AUS.)\u2014broke the\ncourse record.\nBigger Each Year\nIn 1958 the entry had risen to\n42 teams and I.C. did very well\nto come second to Liverpool,\nbeating into third place a formidable Southampton team containing Martin Hyman and Bruce\nTulloh (later to gain fame as a sub-four minute miler and European 5,000 metres champion).\nAlso running for the first ume\nthat year was Ron Hill the prodigious little runner from Bolton\nwho is currently going from\nstrength to strength and holds the\nU. K.6m. record (taken from\nHyman) and must be one of our\nTHE HYDE PARK\nbest hopes for Tokyo. This years\nrace will not seem the same without Ron, who has now left Manchester University.\nThe entry shot up during the\nnext two years until by 1960\nthere were 70 teams entered, including an all-blue team from St.\nCatherines Oxford and people\nsuch as Tulloh, Turner (winner\nof the recent inter-counties cross\ncountry race), Tim Briault and\nTrevor Shoefield: the race that\nyear was won by Durham with\nI.C.4t h.I. C. Successes\n1961 saw one of the most exciting races ever and a very unlucky one for I.C. John Collins\nhad brought us into a5 sec. lead\non the 4th lap and John Cleator\nrunning the third fastest time of\nthe day increased this to 30 sees;\na lead which good though it was,\ncould not prevent Hill and\nTurner, running the two fastest\nlaps of the day, from overtaking\nour last man George Wenk and\npushing us into 3rd place.\nThe following year however our\nluck turned and, for the first time\nsince 1949 we were victorious.\nAmongst a record field of 80,\nI.C.'s team of Roy, Fitzsimmons,\nYoung, Collins, Wilkins, and\nCleator had stiff opposition from\nteams like Leeds Manchester and\nNottingham, and individuals like\nBriault, Johnson and Turner.\nThat year saw the entry of the\ngreat Herb Elliot; competing in\nwhat must have been his last\nserious race before studies and\ncontroversy about his amateur\nstatus caused his premature retirement from athletics. I.C.'s victory was large ty\\l ue to the\ninspired running of John Cleator\non the last lap\u2014taking over 37\nsees, down on Leeds he produced\nthe third fastest lap of the day to\ntake the lead in the last half-mile.\nWell-Known Starters\nIt is customary to invite_ some famous athletics personality to\nstart the race. In the past we have\nhad such people as Pat Sage,\nJack Crump, Martin Lucking\n(Empire shot-put champion),\nBrian Hewson (Great Britain's best half-miler for many years),\nand last year Robbie Brightwell\n(European 440 yd s. record holder)\n\u2014though his false start of last\nyear can i>n ly be described as\nunfortunate.\nA race of this magnitude requires an immense amount of\norganisation and I can think of\nno better way to end an article\non the Hyde Park than by paying\ntribute to its organisers. The\nwork of these tireless people occupies almost a full 12 months;\nstarting soon after one years race\nand culminating in a fever of activity and worry at the next\nRecords-but not enough\nYes! I.C. does actually possess\na record library, but what a Library! Only 200 records and\na great many of them in an unplayable condition. Hie reason of\ncourse, is that the Musicai Society\nhave not had enough money to\nfinance the Library. However,\nthe purpose of this article is\nneither to moan about the\nquantity and quality of the records\nnor to cry out for something to\nbe done, because something is\nbeing done. But first, what is a a decent library?\nSuch a library exists to enable\npeople to indulge in musical appreciation at minimal cost to\nthemselves; few people can afford\nto purchase all the records they\njust want to play through a few\ntimes. Evidently a record library\nmust possess recordings of all the\nbetter known works and musicians plus a great number of\nlesser known works before it can\npossibly cater for the tastes of the\nmajority of music lovers. Ideally\nI.C. needs a library of some 600-700 records which should be run\non the same lines as the Haldane\nlibrary, where incidentally it is\nnow housed, (a student cannot be\nexpected to cope with such a library without experience).\nWith the increasing number of\npeople in Hall it is becoming more\nand more desirable that there\nshould be a good record library\nin the College and to this end\nsome 40 new records have been\npurchased with more to come. It\nis hoped that money will be provided to keep the library expanding as well as replacing worn out\nrecords; in three or four years\ntime there should then be a record\nlibrary of 600 records, all in\ndecent order. The only remaining\nquestion is, will students use it?\n\u2014they most certainly should and\nfor those who don't know, you\ncan borrow records at the nominal\nfee of Is. per week, with a \u00a31\ndeposit to join the library which\nis open all weekdays (including\nlunch hours) in the Haldane\nLibrary.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX9 COUNCIL JAMES WALKER WRITES Although the Council Meeting on Monday, 3rd February, lasted\nfor 6 hours it was a great improvement on the one held the week\nbefore. Everyone had already agreed to the setting up of the position of Deputy President but there were many views on the method\nof election of this post and also that of the President and Secretary.\nAfter discussion all the possible permutations of elections, i.e., all\nthree from Council to all three from the Union Floor, at some length,\nit was decided that the Deputy President alone should be elected\nby the Union Members at the Annual General Meeting\nThis method has practical difficulties ; for if the Deputy President also wishes to stand for President and is elected there appeared\nno easy solution to electing a new Deputy President. After much\nheated argument, during which some Council Members changed\ntheir minds over the Union Election of the Deputy President. It was\ndecided that Council should not appoint the new Deputy President.\nFelix\nThe Felix Board Report caused\nsome controversy as reported in\nthe Late News of our last issue.\nMany people on Council thought\nthat Dave Watson had been more\nthan a little harsh in his condemnation of Michael Combes and\nafter an exchange between the\nPresident and Roger Henson, who\nraised the matter, the report was\naltered to congratulate Felix on\nfinancial success of this paper.\nOther Matters\nAmong other points raised\nwere, the opening of the Union\nBar on Sunday evenings. This\nshould happen again soon, but\nalas to the detriment of the midday customers as it may not open\nat midday on Sundays due to\nstaff difficulties (robbing Peter to\npay Paul?). A department of\nSocial Studies is being set up at\nthe College, and optional social\nstudies will shortly be a part of\nevery degree course. This, I sup-pose, is to try to change the\ngeneral opinion of illiterate beer\ndrinking engineers.\nA collection of paintings is to\nbe exhibited in advantageous\npositions around South Side. Another move to improve our\ngeneral knowledge perhaps ?\nKennedy Fund\nThe Council defeated by 15\nvotes to none a motion that the\nUnion should organise a collection for the Kennedy Fund. This\nfund is to provide a scholarship\nfor a British Graduate to study\nat Harvard. As a part of London's \u00a35,000 towards the \u00a325,000\ntarget I.C. would have to provide\n\u00a3600, 4/- per student\u2014an impossible feat. Collecting tins will be\nprovided but there will be no\nhigh pressure salesmanship.\nThis is the first time that the\nUnion Member has been able to\nelect a member of the Executive\n(except the R.C. S.,C.&G., and\nMines Presidents) and it marks a great step forward in the Union.\nA Deputy President, in charge of\nthe Union Buildings, could do a great deal to changing most pe o ple's attitude to the Union.\nQueries, complaints, etc., dealt\nwith promptly will make for better running of the Union. Let us\nhope that this is the beginning of\na Union revival, for whatever\nanybody says the Union is in a bad state when so few people\ntake advantage of the many\nfacilities provided.\nCar Parking\nBob Schroter, in his car parking report, made one very enlightening statement: the South\nSide car park can be used by anyone at I.C., not just the Halls\nResidents. This means that those\nin Hall have wasted their shillings\non buying those South Side\nStickers. The Car Parking Committee is looking very carefully\ninto the need of providing parking places. To this end a questionnaire will be sent out to\neveryone at the College in the\nnear future and everyone is\nurged to answer it in their own\ninterest.\nCouncil Quotes\n\" Keep your big mouths shut!\"\nHavard of the President.\n\" Could you please repeat the\nmotion on the floor.\"\n\" There is no motion on the\nfloor.\"\n\" I'm not trying to stir.\"\n\"Complete abortion.\" Pete\nAlison on Council.\n\" A* great improvement.\" Felix\nreporter.\nH AND DO YOU CONSIDER\nYOUR GRANT TO BE\nENOUGH FOR A FAIR\nSTANDARD OF LIVING ?\nIn his report to Council about\nFelix, the President delivered a harsh and unfair statement neglecting the obvious fact that this\nyear the editor has succeeded in\nproducing an economic and original newspaper. On the other hand\nMr. Combes has sailed very\nclose to the wind and no one\nwould say that his editorial policy\nhas met with universal acclaim.\nThis academic year has seen\nmany heated battles between Mr.\nCombes and the executive led by\nMr. Watson. The reason for this\ncould be the orig if i al policy of the\neditor or the executive's lack of\nexperience in the production of\na newspaper. It is justifiable that\nMr. Combes becomes annoyed by\ncriticisms levelled by people with\nno experience of Felix, on small\nmatters such as the printers' er-r or s, which are almost impossible\nto avoid or the fact that a complete financial statement cannot be\nproduced until the end of the year,\nbecause bills in respect of advertisements and other matters\nare not paid till late in the year.\nMr. Combes seems to be able to\ngauge accurately how far he can\ngo without having to resign, but\nthis is not always true of his\nstaff. The whole structure and\npolicy of Felix is so delicately\npoised at present, that cases of\nmisrepresentation of fact, which\nhave come from the pen of one of\nthe staff, could very easily destroy\nthe achievements of this year.\nCouncil and the President\nA recent report of council\nproceedings has suggested that the\nwhole thing is a waste of time and\nthat council members would be\nmuch better occupied elsewhere.\nNo mention was made of the way\nin which council members occupy\nthemselves at meetings, and this\nmight be of interest. Mr. Price\ntalks a lot and gets confused; Mr.\nTye talks little but usually sense;\nMr. Edwards is perpetually dis-satisfied; Mr. Stocks feels; Mr.\nEllis reiterates; Mr. Henson defends Felix successfully; Mr.\nMassey's ideas are becoming\nmore conventional; Miss Tait\ndraws interesting landscapes; Mr.\nBeadle takes notes to some pur-pose, Mr. Schroter is the voice\nof City and Guilds. ; It might\nalso be in order to report some of\nthe things which were discussed\nat the last meeting. The Felix\nboard report produced sparks between Mr. Watson and Mr. Henson, who demanded its with-draw al. Unfortunately, although\nall the members of the Felix board\nwere present, only Mr. Schroter\nand Mr. Tye dared to suggest that\nthe President might be wrong, and\nasked for a comment to the fact\nthat at least the newspaper was ah\neconomic success this year.\nMr. Watson told the meeting\nthat if business continued after\n9.0 p.m. free beer would be the\norder of the day and Mr. Havard\nimmediately saw his destiny. He\nwas elected to the books tall committee for his pains. . Mr. Berry\nproduced a concise report of the\nproceedings of UL U Presidents\nCouncil and shed light on the\nJohn F. Kennedy fund which\nturns out to be a very dubious\nproposal.

    "content": "6 FELIX RESEARCH SECTIONS\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nThe transmission ot information\nhas long been a problem of interest to electrical engineers. In the\nearly days research workers were\nconcerned almost entirely with the\nthen formidable task of making\ndevices that worked. Today this\nemphasis on hardware alone is\nreceding and engineers are taking\na much broader view of communication problems.\nOne field of research in his\nlaboratory that has captured\nattention is Psycho-acoustics,\nwhich is concerned with the\nmeasurement of aural perception.\nThe sudden interest in this subject stems from the work of\nClaude E. Shannon (\"The Mathematical Theory of Communications,\" 1948), which brought\nabout the realization that present\nmethods of communication are\nmonstrously inefficient. For\ninstance, according to Shannon's theory, one telephone line can do\nthe work of a hundred, provided\nthe speech signals are suitably\ncoded. Practically, a tenfold\nimprovement is envisaged. The\nmost promising approach to date\nconcerns itself with finding /out\nwhich parameters of sound are\nimportant to the human listener,\nthe implication being that once we\nknow this we'heed only transmit\ninformation which is relevant for\nperception and omit the rest.\nAn investigation of the phenomenon of binaural fusion has\nyielded results which jx r in t the\nway to improvements in practical\ntelephone systems. It has been\nestablished that a very small time\ndifference and/or amplitude difference between the signals arriving at each ear are the primary\nphysical variables enabling us to\nperceive the direction of a sound\nsource. Further experiments\nhave shown, for example, that if\ntwo sounds are spatially far apart\nthen it is easier to concentrate on\n.one or other of the sounds. On\nthe basis of this a scheme has\nbeen developed using binaural\ntechniques whereby the wanted\nspeech sound and the unwanted\nnoise in a telephone channel are\neach given different apparent positions. This makes it easier for\nthe listener to concentrate on the\nwanted message, resulting in improved intelligibility.\nOther work in the Laboratory\nis concerned with the perception\nof short bursts of sound, the perception of moving sounds, :md\nwith the factors influencing the\nformation of a single sound with\nstimuli from two separate sources.\nWork is also being carried out\nin the per csp tion of sharp contours on a noisy television screen,\nas well as a scheme for scaling the\nquality of television pictures produced by a bandwidth compression sch2 me: although the lat tter is unlikely to be significant for\nbroadcasting purposes, several\ninterested industrial organizations\nare studying its possible applications in other directions.\nIn the course of tackling the\nabove problems new techniques\nhave been evolved and many of\nthese have been vf interest to\nworkers in other fields. Similarly\nmany of the methods applied in\nthe Communications Laboratory\noriginate from apparently unrelated disciplines such, for example,\nas Quality Control or Mental Test\nTheory. There are many who\nspeculate on the superficial nature\nof inter-disciplinary barriers. This\nLaboratory provides an example\nof just how superficial some of\nthese barriers are.\neffect has been termed the piezo-magnetic effect, through which a specimen becomes magnetized\nwhen stressed mechanically. This\nhas recently been discussed as a possible basis for the prediction of\nearthquakes. The Materials Section is investigating the effects\nwith the hope of finding new materials with improved properties.\nResearch is also being carried\nout on the shape dependence of\nmagneto strict ion in standard\nmagnetic materials.\nSemiconductors\nWork on semiconductors includes a number of basic physical\ninvestigations, noticeably measurement of carrier lifetime which has\ndirect relevance to transistor\nperformance. In addition, new\ninter metallic semiconductor materials are being synthesised for\napplication to thermo magnetic refrigeration using the Ettingssystems and machines\nThe economic progress and development of any country depends\nupon the availability of a cheap\nand abundant source of power.\nIn most countries, electrical energy provides this source and requires that the generation, transmission and distribution of\nelectricity continually expands to\nmeet the ever-growing demands of\nthe consumer. Most countries now\ndouble their total demand for\nelectricity every seven to ten\nyears. Consequently, electrical\nengineering must progress at an\nequal rate to enable new and more\nefficient power stations to be commissioned and a transmission or\ngrid network to be built which\nwill ensure adequate supplies at\nMATERIALS This academic year has seen\nthe beginning of an interdepartmental \" Science of Materials\"\ncourse at I.C. in which Electrical\nEngineering Department * is a participant. It's aim is to provide an introduction to theoretical\nand engineering aspects of ma-te rials. Projects undertaken in\nthird terms lead to aD.I.C. Research\nThe research interests of the\nMaterials Section are centred on\ninvestigation and development of\nmaterials with potential technological importance. There are\nthree main groups:\n(1) Magnetic materials.\n(2) Semiconductors\n(3) Thin films and surface\nstudies.\nMagnetic Materials\nThree years ago the first reports\nwere made of the observation of\nthe magneto-electric effect. Materials showing the effect are\ncapable of magnetization by the\napplication of an electric field.\nWhilst the effect is small it is of\npotential importance in, for\nexample, the thermionic generator\nsince a standing electric field\ncould be produced simply by\nputting a permanent magnet\naround the device. A related\nhausen effect. This project is a joint one with the British Oxygen\nCompany aimed at producing a low-temperature refrigerator.\nThin Films\nThe thin films and surface\nstudies group is concerned with\nthe properties of metals and\nsemiconductors in thin-film form.\nA study of the magnetic properties of thin nickel films is being\nundertaken with the co-operation\nof International Computers and\nTabulators Ltd. Mr. D.S. Campbell, of the Plessey Company,\nwho is a visiting Lecturer in the\nSection, is supervising other thin-film resistors and capacitors.\nStudies of germanium in thin-film form are aimed at determining the influence of mechanical\nstructure on electrical properties.\nThis has importance in the present\nconsiderable effort being put into\nthe development of a thin-film\nactive device.\nA mass spectrometer analyse r is being used to investigate the exchange kinetics between a gas\nads or bed on the surface of a transition metal film and its free\nisotope.\nFurther work has been initiated\non the electrical properties of\nuranium dioxide and on slow-electron diffraction.\nDEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING HIGH BLOCK\nMICROWAVE LABORATORIES COMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES ELECTRON PHYSICS LABORATORIES CONTROL SYSTEMS LABORATORIES POWER SYSTEMS4 ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE LABS MATERIALS LABORATORIES ADMINISTRATION.

    "content": "FELIX5 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SUPPLEMENT BY SIR WILL IS JACKSON This is, perhaps, a permissible\noc casio\" on which to blow a trumpet for electrical engineering.\nThe various branches of it are\nnow afford ng employment to\nabout one nil lion people; the\nannual val u. of its manufactured\nproducts L approaching \u00a31,000\nmillion and, of these products,\nover \u00a33 ^0 million worth are being\nexported.\nThe past 25 years or so have\nseen the emergence of a world\nwide system of telecommunications; of television and radar; of\nthe electronic digital computer\nand of automation; of a wide\nrange of solid state devices, of\nwhich the transistor is out stand ing; of commercial forms of such\nscientific instruments as the electron microscope, the mass spectrometer and the particle accelerator; and of fusion-type nuclear\npower stations.\nAlongside these brand new\ndevelopments there have also\nbeen considerable improvements\nin previously well-established\nfields. For example, since 1948\nthe size of steam-turbine driven\nelectrical generator units has risen\nfrom 30 to 500 megawatts; the\noverall thermal efficiency has increased from 27.6 to 39.2 per cent;\nand the capital cost of the total\ninstallation per kilowatt sent out\nhas decreased from \u00a367 to \u00a335.\nWe must now say that these\nand other achievements which\nmik ht be mentioned are only to be\ncredited in part to electrical\nengineers. They are, in fact, the\nresult in varying degrees of cooperation between electrical engineers and physicists, chemists,\nmathematicians, metallurgists and\ncivil, mechanical, chemical and\naeronautical engineers. Indeed,\nthe pursuit of electrical engineering is by no means an activity\nmerely of men who call themselves electrical engineers, but of\nteams of representatives of a diversity of scientific and technological disciplines, to which must\nalso be added the contributions\nof members of other professional\npersuasions such as economics,\nlaw, sociology, etc.\nIt is the job of the Electrical\nEngineering Department to prepare its undergraduate and postgraduate students for participation in this broadly-based partner-ship. We should be claiming too\nmuch were we to pretend that we\nyet know how best to do this,\nsince we are involved in a rapidly\nchanging scientific, technological\nand sociological situation. What\nwe can claim, however, is that we\nare conscious of the need for continuous re-appraisal of our undergraduate and postgraduate curricula and that we are now deeply\nengaged in this; and that we are\ncr ving a variety of experiments in\nan attempt to improve the techniques of lecturing and tutorial\nwork. For example, the whole of\ncur new building has now been\nwired for closed-circuit television\nto enable demonstrations to be\ntelevised from laboratories to lec-ture-rooms, and other unconventional teaching techniques are also\nbeing investigated.\nIn addition, we are experimenting with the incorporation of\ncourses aimed at opening the\nminds of our undergraduates to\nthe humanistic aspects of engineering work, and to the social\nconsequences and implications of\nits progress. The fact that not all\nour students seem yet to be wholly\n\" with us \" in some of these experiments is unlikely to deter us\nfrom our continued attempt to\nprepare them more effectively for\ntheir later careers and for life.\nWe have now been in our new\nhigh block building for about\neighteen months and, on the\nwhole, are very pleased with it. Its\ntotal population of teaching,\ntechnical and secretarial staff, and\nof undergraduate and postgraduate students, is well over 400, and\nthe fy rt her growth arising from\nthe implementation of the Robbins Report\u2014combined with our\nundertaking to house the College\nComputing Centre\u2014p rpm is e to\nproduce a tight situation much\nearlier than was envisaged when\nthe building was planned only\nseven or eight years ago.\nAs with other Departments, our\nmain difficulty is likely to be that\nof acquiring a sufficient number\nof new staff members of high\nquality, partly to deal with the\nexpanding student numbers and\npartly to replace those who gain\npromotion elsewhere or who 30\noverseas on second ment to teach\nin the engineering schools of the\ndeveloping countries. In the latter\nconnection, one of our staff\u2014Mr.\nJ.C. Carpenter\u2014has been serving\nas Professor of Electrical Engineering in the University of the\nWest Indies for the past two\nyears. He will be rejoining us in\nOctober next, but by then Mr.\nR.A. King may have commenced\na three-year second ment as Professor of Control Engineering to\nthe Indian Institute of Technology\nin Delhi \u2014 with which Imperial\nCollege has established a \"Sister-hood\" relationship\u2014as also will\none of the most experienced of\nour technical staff, Mr. A. A. White, who will serve as electrical\nsupervisor to the Institute at\nDelhi The Department attaches\ngreat importance to this kind of\noverseas service, and is determined to extend it wherever circumstances permit.\nThe designation of Imperial\nCollege as a S.I.S.T.E.R.( Special\nInstitution for Scientific and\nTechnological Education and Research) by the Robbins Committee adds emphasis to the national\nimportance of the College's contribution at the postgraduate level.\nWith a view to strengthening our\nown contribution in this respect\nwe are seeking to attach to the\nstaff of the Department as Special\nLecturers an increasing number of\noutstanding practicing electrical\nengineers. This session we n re in the fortunate position that two\nindustrial concerns have seconded\nsenior staff members to us on a half-time basis, and in addition a member of the Electricity Council, the head of the Post Office\nResearch Station, and a senior\nengineer of the British Transport\ncommission are giving invaluable\nhelp as part-time lecturers and\norganisers of postgraduate symposia in their special fields.\nSome exciting new prospects of\nelectrical engineering development\nare in the pipeline. A variety of\nnew solid state devices, illustrated\nby t ne maser and the laser, may\nsoon become of considerable\ntechnological importance; it may\nnot be long before low-tempera-ture physics enters the domain of\npower engineering as well as that\nof the computer; while rapidly increasing effort is being devoted to\nseveral new possibilities of large-scale electrical power generation\nemploying thermionic, thermo-electric, magneto hydro dynamic and thermo-nuclear processes.\nThe translation of these prospects into efficient, reliable and\neconomic devices and equipment\nwill involve the resolution of\nengineering problems at least as\ndifficult and as intellectually\nsearching as the scientific ones\nv being investigated. It is up\nto us to ensure that the student\nproducts of the City and Guilds\nare fully capable of resolving i them.\nENGINEERING IN MEDICINE\nEngineering in Medicine is a new group in the Electrical Department, which was set up to\nfulfil the joint functions of postgraduate training and research.\nPostgraduate Training\nThe training is intended mainly\nfor experienced graduates in medicine and biology normally engaged in research and clinical\nanalysis who receive here a year's intensive instruction in the principles and use of electronic n nd mechanical apparatus, and a thorough understanding of modern physical and mathematical\ntechniques relevant to their work.\nA considerable amount of interdepartmental co-operation is involved in providing this training\nand specialized lecturers i rom medical research institutes also\ncontribute.\nThe nine students taking the\ncourse this year come from\nBritain, Canada, Italy and Portugal. All but two hold higher\ndegrees and have already done\nmuch research. Five are medically qualified and two are physiologists, one is qualified in mechanical engineering and physics, and\nthe last has a mechanical engineering degree and has been\nworking on artificial limbs. Others\namong the students have previously been doing research on such\nsubjects as the application of\nfluid flow to circulation in the\nkidneys; the bio-chemistry of\nanaesthetics; the chemistry of\ndrugs, particularly in their effects\non processes in the brain; and\naviation medicine.\nAlthough the students attend\nover 200 lectures, the main part of\nthe course is laboratory work\nwhich is closely super viz ed by the\nstaff in the group. In the second\nhalf of the year each student\nundertakes an original experimental project, which is chosen\nto suit his special interests, and on\nwhich he will finally write a full\nreport.\nResearch\nThe research section of the\ngroup deals mainly with investigating brain and nerve processes,\nand with instrumentation. An\ninteresting problem being tackled\nis to find out how the human\nbrain constructs an integrated\npicture of the external world by\ncombining the separate evidence\nfrom the senses of sight, hearing\nand touch. One of the research\nstudents is investigating a simplified form of this problem involving only sight and hearing. A subject learns to track an acoustic\nimage, and studies are made of\nthe influence on his judgements\nabout image position of aiding or\nconflicting information from a secondary, visual, ^image. The\nresults of these experiments may\ngive insight into how we build up\na picture of the world around us.\n\n"

Most of the engineering departments have been\nrelocated in new buildings, and many of the students have taken up\nresidence in the Southside Halls. Soon there will be well over 2,000\nstudents in Guilds, and of these, over half will be postgraduates.\nThere is already a change in Guilds-feeling, which has showed itself\nin the various attitudes of the expanding numbers of \" Active-Guildsmen.\" Matters of importance are being dealt with on the Guilds\nUnion floor, and attempts are being made to integrate the Sport and\nThought elements of Guilds Life, so that the two can co-exist without\nun balance. The beer mug has gone back on the shelf, but it is still\nan element in Guilds Union life as a social integrator. See a friend\nover the rim, even if the post is full of orange.\nFreshers Dinners\nThe Freshers' Dinners of old\nwere not the* best way of introducing student to staff. The more\nordered dinners this year were a little nearer the formula needed.\nThe loss of Spanner showed how\nSouthside opening has bolstered\nGuilds spirit in the resident\nGuildsman. The ring of twenty\nchairs awaiting telephoned progress reports; the ring of coffee\ncup stain on a broken cipher\nclue ; the code solving on departmental blackboards; the loaded\ncars to remote destinations . . .\nand Dartmoor. Morphy Day was\na mess due to lack of liaison between the other constituent col-leg es. Almost all the organisation was left to Guilds, but we\ndid not receive the assistance of\nthe others, and so chaos reigned\nfor a short while. R.C.S. and\nMines did not have the slightest\nidea as to what was happening.\nThey were unprepared, and were\nit not for the Loudhailer that\nGuilds hired, the return journey\nwould have been a disaster.\nPedal Car Race\nAn indication of the \" Go \" in\nGuilds was given by the carol\nsinging collection. Over \u00a3100\nwas collected in under four\nhours. \u00a325 was raised for the\nMental Health campaign by auctioning a car. Newly formed\ngroups of Guildsmen are doing\nnew things. The Bristol pedal\ncar race will see the result of the\nlabours of one such group, in the\nnewly designed pedal cars being\nbuilt by mechanical engineering\nstudents. The Radio Society is\nshowing great enterprise in the\ntelevision broadcasting system\nthat they are developing around\nthe television camera that was\ngiven them by I.T. A. Not Theatrical Performances\nThe various Engineering societies have very varied programmes set out for the session,\nbut often bad publicity for these\nevents lets them down. Mid-day\nEng. Soc. meetings are an innovation this year, but the Faber\nPrize even has been poor, there\nbeing only one entry by the closing date. The Guilds Aeronautical Engineering Society has\nbeen formed this year for Aeronautical students, and they are\nalready organising a Seminar in\nthis College for European Students, to take place this summer.\nIn the past, Union meetings\nhave played to packed houses.\nThis is wrong. Union meetings\nshould not be theatrical perform-ances, they should be a forum for\nstudent discussion from the floor,\nand a means of communicating\ndetails of Union activities to the\nstandard Guildsman. These may\nbe put over in a lively way, but it\nshould be possible for serious debate to take place without a monster explosion, or a barrage\nof chalk at the speaker. This\nyear has seen changes in the format of Union meetings, just as\nthere have been changes in other\nparts of Guilds. We must never\nlose the \" Sport\" side of our\nUnion ; beer is most essential as\na social equalise r, but we must\nnot bias another pint; active discussion over the full gamut of\nstudent interests is essential. But\nwho is to balance ?\ndear sir... Dear Sir,\nWhilst appreciating the need\nfor more political activity within\nI.C. and realizing the wants of the\nright-wing fanatics for more pre-election vote get ter s.I nevertheless feel that a recent pamphlet\ncirculating in College has gone too\nfar.

    "content": "FELIX FELIX-A REPLY This article is written for Felix since comments published in\nthe \\9%th and 199//i issues clearly require that certain members of\n'the Board of Directors should give some account of their actions.\nMr. Combes lives within a few yards of me in Beit Hall. His\neditorial in the \\99th Felix must have been in existence in manuscript or proof form for at least a week. I had no knowledge of\nit until to-day, Wednesday, which was effectively too late to meet\nthe copy deadline for the 200th edition. I have therefore made\narrangements directly with the printers to have this statement\ntype-set.\nThere has not been sufficient time to consult other members of\nthe Felix board and this must therefore be taken as a personal view.\nNeither have I had time to check certain factual information.\nDAVE WATSON! \u00a3T WHAT ACTUALLY DID\nHAPPEN\nFelix is \"The Newspaper of\nImperial College Union \" (though\nthis is no longer stated on the\ntitle page.) It has been developed\nas such by generations of I.C. students. Last year it broke even\nfinancially so there is no insuperable barrier to any group of\npeople publishing an alternative.\nThe Felix Board takes the view\nthat the reporting of Union activities is essential to the Union,\nespecially in view of the College's increasing size and diversification.\nIf Felix did not exist, it would be\nnecessary to create it.\nA series of occasions have\narisen in which relevant material\nwas not published. This happened\nlast term (e.g. the Boat Races on\nMorphy Day and the Swimming\nGala) and there were several incidences in which such material\nwas rejected in Felix number\n198: \u2014\n1. Carnival News: The Carnival\ncannot succeed without pub-li city.( Subsequently published)\n2. The Account of the \" European Week \" in Paris. (Subse-que ntl y published along with\na letter of protest.)\n3. A report of a Council meeting.\nThe Union cannot exist as a democratic institution unless it\nis subjected to independent\ncriticism. If Council is a waste of time, it must be seen\nto be so.\nAt the Board meeting, the Editor was asked after a vote of five\nin favour and two against (Mr.\nCombes and myself abstaining) to\nattempt to \" improve \" the situation in future. Judging by the\nfollowing edition the Editor has\ncomplied with this request and\none would have thought the matter ended there.\n\" THE HOLY BLISSFUL\nMARTYR\" However, Mr. Combes has seen\nfit to publish an editorial which\ncontains the clear implication that\nan attempt has been made by the\nFelix board to limit his freedom\nof comment. I wish to deny this\ncategorically. In my view any\nsuch attempt would have been\nquite improper. The attitude\nwhich the Board adopted was entirely in accord with Mr. Massey's comment \" print what you like,\nbut you must report . . . (these\nthings).\"\nMr. Combes sees himself cast\nin the role of martyr to the principle of freedom of the Press, with\nmyself and Les Massey as the\nprincipal persecutors. This allegation is of such a nature that we\nfeel there is only one course of\naction remaining. We intend to\ntable at motion at the Union\nmeeting on Feb. 18th so that both\nsides can be heard in full and in\nthe open, and the Union can decide the issue. Mr. Combes, no\nless than the President and Secretary, is entitled to a full hearing\nfrom the student body to whom\nwe are all responsible.\nRecently, knowing that I was\ngoing to write this letter, I asked\na group of faithful Church folks,\n\" What do you think of when I say LENT?\" Three things came to their\nminds: (i) Forty days, (ii) denying\nyourself something, (iii) a pre par tion for Easter. It was a long\ntime before the period of forty\ndays was accepted as the length of\nLent, and at first there was no\nconnection whatever with our\nLord's period in the wilderness.\nSecondly it was originally not a preparation for Easter, but for\nwhat happened at Easter\u2014Baptism, Confirmation and First\nCommunion. The preparation was\nfor a fuller life with God. The\nemphasis at first was not on doing\nwithout, but on training for the\nnew life of worship, work and\nwitness on which they would embark as they came out of the\nwaters of Baptism. They were\nsealed with the gift of the Holy\nSpirit by the laying on of hands,\nreceived the Bread of Life, and\nwert t out to live this new life\nwithin them in God's world. It\nwas all positive, constructive; not\nnegative.\nIS SELFSACRIFICEA MISCONCEPTION\nThe True Meaning of Lent\nAt this time one is constantly\nhearing the question \" what are\nyou giving up for Lent?\" It is\nrather unfortunate that Lent has\ncome to be associated with this\nform of self sacrifice. This is\nmost certainly how the Reformers, who set out the prayer book,\ndid not mean it to be used.\nIn the Bible there is no\nreference whatever to such a period, and it is believed that it\ncame into being some centuries\nafter the Church had been\nfounded. At the time of the\nReformation, those concerned re-tai ned. it, as it was a period which\ncould usefully be employed as a time during which Christians\ncould look forward to Easter.\nHence by prayer and, fasting\nwith study of the scriptures they\ncould focus their attention on this,\nt'l3 greatest event in this World's history\u2014the death ; ..id resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nThis fasting and prayer is a custom dating back to the early\nChurch, and meant complete\nabstinence from food and drink\nin order to spend the whole time\nin prayer with God. It generally\nlasted only for one day and at the\nvery most for three; nowhere in\nscripture are we told to fast for\nforty days or to make efforts of\nself sacrifice. The only sacrifice\nasked\" of us being that of our\nwhole lives in His service.\nShould any further proof be\nrequired, then Paul in his letter\nto Collossians chapter 2, verse\n16 to chapter 3, verse 4 answers\na problem which is remarkably\nsimilar to this one of Lent.\nM. BAILEY,\n(Sec. I.C.C. U.) Lent to be worthwhile must be\npositive: the emphasis on what\nyou do, rather than on what you\ndon't do. It is a special effort with\na purpose\u2014that we can enter\nmore fully into the Resurrection\nlife of Jesus. That Resurrection\nlife is for the whole of man\u2014\nbody, mind and spirit\u2014so any\neffort in Lent must involve all\nthree. So (i) we should make a deeper offering of our physical life\nto God. Most of us are far too\nindulgent in this part of our life,\nand let our body rule us. To\ndiscipline our body make some\nact of self-denial, so that we\ntrain the body to be the obedient\nservant of our will and not the\nmaster of our actions. Some indulgence surrendered: \u2014 fewer\ncigarettes smoked, and the money\ngiven for the hungry; fewer pints\nof beer, so that we can get that\nland-rover rolling in Chidya.\nThese are proven helps in self-mastery as far as our physical\nlife is concerned. But the more\nconstructive thing is ALSO to go\nbeyond this and seek day by day\nto glorify God in our bodies. In\nan age of sexual indulgence, in\nthe cult of cosines s, we Christians\nare to rejoice in our physical life\nand to see the living of it as a way\nof adoring God. (ii) We need to\nglorify God with our minds, entering more and more into the\nknowledge of what God is like\nand what His purpose is for ourselves and the world. This means\nreading one book on the Christian\nFaith during Lent and kn a king time to take your part in some\ncourse of instruction, school of\nprayer, or discussion group: (iii)\nIt means the whole of self goes\nout to ever-deeper union with\nGod. A \"Retreat should be a normal thing for Christians during\nLent, and in your prayer time\ndaily more adoration of God and\nmore waiting on God.\nSo a happy Lent to you.\nJOHN SHAND, S. S. J.E "

Together these\ncourses aim to probe questions\nwhich are of interest to intelligent\ncitizens in general and to technologists in particular. The\ncourses are neither a cultural\nsheep-dip nor a dose of cabbage\nwater. Their main function is\nporridge-stirring. Seeking to raise\nfundamental questions about\nhuman society and the individual,\nthey are designed to draw attention to some of the social and\npolitical consequences of techno-logy, and to take a penetrating\nlook at some basic artistic and\nhumanist values. They are also\nintended to provide introductions\nto the various fields of thought\nwhich they represent.\nHumanities\nMr. Goodlad's course in the\n\" Humanities has the twin aims\nof providing a literary commentary on certain important 20th Century events, and of introducing techniques of criticism. Chalk\nand talk recounting of history has\nbeen avoided, and the course has\nconcentrated on giving \" worm's eye views' of the subjects covered;\nit has sought to examine what has\nb: jn going on lh rou~ h the eyes of\n\\ liters of literature, while films\nand select reading lists have\noffered the broader picture to\nthose interested.. The First World\nWar, for example, was seen\nthrough the eyes of some of the\nWar Poets \u2014 Owen, Sassoon,\nBrooke\u2014and through the memoirs of such writers as Robert\nGraves, Edmund Blunden and\nVera Brittain. The Great Depression was examined through the\neyes of Orwell, Priestley, Greenwood, Spender and Steinbeck, as\nwell as through some of the social\nsurveys of the period which\nsought to bring the plight of the\nunemployed to public notice. A similar technique is being followed with the Spanish Civil War\nand the Second World War.\nThe \" worm's eye \" technique\naims not only to show what the\ncataclysmic events of this century\nmeant to the articulate layman,\nbut also to distinguish the marks\nof excellence in the various literary genre\u2014poetry, novels, essays,\nplays.' A lecture on propaganda\nas used in the two World Wars\nwas followed by discussion of the\npropagandist aims of certain\nnovelists, in particular the writers\nof Utopias and anti-Utopias\nIdeas and techniques of presenting ideas received equal attention.\nAgain, the current discus ion of\ndrama aims not only to show the\ndramatists' ideas, but to analyse\nthe effectiveness of various types\nof drama as vehicles for ideas.\nPolitics\nThe Introduction to Politics,\npresented by Mr. K. Minogue and\nMr. Robert McKenzie of LSE,\nhas added a further dimension to\nthe coverage of 20th Century\nevents. Mr. McKenzie took the\nlid off the British political scene,\nexposing the fallacies of some current beliefs about the operation of\nthe parties. Mr. Minogue probed\nthe very basis of the democratic\nsystem, analysing the nature of\ngovernment and the attempts of\nthe liberal states to limit individual power by placing legislative\nexecutive and judicial power in\ndifferent hands. By way of con-tra st, Mr. Minogue gave a thorough analysis of modern totalitarianism, drawing material from\nStalinist Russia and Nazi Germany. Examining the affinity to\nreligion of the official ideologies,\nhe drew parallels with certain\nmillen i al movements that have\narisen from time to time in the\nworld, often as a result of rapid\nsocial change. This social change\nmay in turn be the result of rapid\ntechnological change. This was\na subject dwelt on by Dr. Benedict\nin his course introducing\nSocial Anthropology\nDr. Benedict also drew attention to the impact of technology\non primitive societies, and explained the function of millen i al movements and cults-U.S. Ghost\ndancers. Cargo Cults in the Pacific\netc.\u2014in restructuring the social\nrelationships damaged by rapid\ntechnological change. In his\nscholarly examination of group\nbehaviour and its possible causes,\nDr. Benedict had occasion to\ndwell on many subjects of intense\ninterest to the socially conscious\nengineer\u2014-the concept of Race,\nand the causes of Race prejudice;\nthe effect of environment on be-ha vi our, such as territorial it y, social rank and hierarchy; the\nimportance of kinship in social\ngroupings, and the varieties of\ngood antidote to the Englishethical and social behaviour, (a man's belief that the customs of\nhis nation are the laws of nature);\nthe definition and importance of\nsocial status.\nPsychology\nThis fourth course, given by\nMr. Price-Williams of LSE,\npromises to push the study pf\nhuman' behaviour as far as academic method can. The first three\ncourses have shown groups ol\nhumans trying to organise them-selves, blasting each other to\npieces, planning Utopias, worshipping strange gods in the stress\nbrought about by technological\nchange\u2014they have shown the\nprophets and politicians trying to\nmanipulate the lives of their peers\nthrough persuasion in novels,\nplays, tracts, broadcasts, films,\nthrough sham democracy and with\nmachine-guns and bombs. Mr.\nPrice-Wiiliams, drawing the veil\nfrom a strange world of rats running through cages, babies smiling\nat broom-heads, birds building\nonto imaginary nests, is providing\na provocative insight into how the\npsychologist tries to find out what\nmakes people tick.\nSound and Fury ?\nThese courses take up time; are\nthey worthwhile? Do they provide\nanything that is not already provided in the college General\nStudies programme? The answers\nto these questions should really\ncome from someone who is taking\nthe courses. But it is hoped that\nthe courses will have had value in\nsome of the following ways:\n* By providing an ordered account of important events which\neveryone is assumed to know\nabout, but which few people are\ntaught about.\n* By providing courses of lectures backed by reading suggestions, discussion meetings,\nand tutorials, which can probe\nmore deeply into a subject than\nan unsupported course.\n* By providing opportunities for\nthose taking the courses to\npractice expressing themselves\nin writing and speech. In addition to group discussions, the\ncourse has included public\nspeaking classes, and a third of\nthe 2EE group have embarked\nupon projects (in anticipation\nof a third-year essay require-ment) on a variety of subjects\nranging from \" The effects of\nTV on children's reading\nhabits\" and \" The use of\nshort wave radio in the First\nWorld War \" to a study of the\nlegend of the Cretan Minotaur.\nBut perhaps the most important\nthing of all, at this stage, is the\nfact that the Electrical Engineering Department is refusing to accept a variety of current assumptions\u2014the assumption that if a student shows proficiency in\nmathematics at the age of 15 and\ngoes onto the Science Side at\nschool, he thereby ends his formal\ncontact with anything other than\nscience and technology; the assumption that one can pick up in\ncasual conversation a knowledge\nof the varied aims and motives of\nhuman beings; the assumption\nthat study of the root causes of\nsome of our current problems\nshould be left to social science\nspecialists, and that technologists\nshould not be distracted by considerations of the possible effects\nof their technology on communities advanced and primitive; the\nassumption that engineers should\nnot take part in government.\nWAR BY WISDOM\nSince this time last week, the\nworld's population will have increased by over a million. Threequarters of these people will be\nundernourished and underprivileged. The task of feeding, hous-ing, educating, and employing\nthese people is awesome. Technology will have a large part to\nplay, and the solution of the\nproblems will be easier if technologists are alive to the social\nand political difficulties involved.\nAt the moment we see through a glass darkly, and the courses\noffered in the Electrical Department will be modified constantly\nin the light of experience. Some\nmay doubt the relevance of the\ncourses at present being offered in\nsuch a complex situation; but a frontal attack is sometimes less\neffective than a flanking attack.\nThe novelist who shows the desperate condition of an unemployed factory worker, the\nanthropologist who shows the\nchaos wrought in a village community by unsubtle introduction\nof technical devices, the political\nscientist who shows how quickly\nconfused citizens turn to strange\ngods and stranger political systems, the psychologist who shows\nthe a rational desires of individuals . . . all these may encourage\nfruitful thought about the social\nsituation. We hope too that they\nmay be intellectually stimulating\nin other ways. This is what we\nmean by stirring the porridge\n. . . we cannot, and would not\nif we could, spoon feed.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX7 Research sect i or cM) POWER &\nOne problem which is receiving\nmuch attention is that of the control of the power system network.\nWhen a fault or short-circuit occurs on the system causing a line\nor generator to trip out of circuit,\nthe resultant redistribution of\npower may cause other lines and\ngenerators to overload, thus precipitating cascade effects which\ncan cause blackouts over large\nareas. In these circumstances,\nthe traditional means of communication and control, exercised\nby control engineers by telephone,\ncannot always operate with sufficient speed to avert serious disturbance and, in the extreme case,\ndisaster.\nIn the future, it will be nec es MACHINES Cont\ns ary for large power systems, as,\nfor example, the British Grid\nSystem, to be operated by centralised computer control. System\ndata will be telemeter ed to the\ncontrol computer which will perform op timi sing calculations and\nissue instructions to satellite com-put ers, which will, in turn, perform the necessary control functions on the generators, turbines\nand transmission system. In the\nlaboratory a variety of control\ntechniques are being studied and\nassessed and new techniques are\nbeing developed in order to arrive\nat a generalised philosophy of\nautomatic control for such systems. AUTOMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM\nThe Automatic Control Section\nis responsible for teaching automatic control techniques and the\nphilosophy that underlies their\napplication throughout the College, both at undergraduate and\npostgraduate levels. It runs a one-year postgraduate course\nwhich is the most advanced of its\nkind in this country. The group\nalso engages in researches on\nautomatic control, seeking to put\nthe subject on a proper scientific\nbasis and to extend our knowledge\non how to apply these techniques\nto the control of industrial pro ces ses. In doing this, extensive use\nis made of digital computers and\nwork has just started on four-year programme of research in\nwhich use will be made of a large-scale digital computer (Atlas) for\ndirect control of some difficult\nindustrial processes.\nIn undertaking this very general\nresearch investigation it is our\nintention to continuously seek\nfavourable industrial contexts for\nthe work and it is pleasing to be\nable to report our continued collaboration and support from five\nindustries with who. we are\nassociated on specific pro j^s, as\nfollows: \u2014\nCentral Electricity Generating\nBoard (Electricity Supply)\nWe are .investigating the possibilities of applying optimal\nmethods to on-line use of digital\ncomputers for adaptive control of\na sizeable power system. The\nproblem of economic scheduling\nof power generation to meet a given load demand while satisfying a power limit and limited\nrate of rise of power has been\ninvestigated. The problem of\noptimal frequency control is also\nbeing investigated.\nRoyal Aircraft Establishment\n(Aerospace)\nWe are investigating the optimal control of a homing missile\nending on a terminal-time criterion where the terminal time is not\naccurately known; and also when\nthe information received by the\nmissile of the target position is\nincomplete, noisy and non-linear.\nUnited Kingdom Atomic Energy\n'Authority-and-National Institute\nfor Research into Nuclear\nScience (Nuclear Power)\nWith the UK A EA we are having discussions on the possibility\nof direct computer control of a nuclear reactor and with NIRNS\nwe are engaged on studies of the\noptimal control of a linear accelerator associated with NIMROD,\nthe high-energy proton acc el era tor.\nBritish Iron and Steel Research\nAssociation (Steel Industry)\nWe are, in collaboration,\nmaking a general study of non-cori fact speed measurement utilizing correlation methods. The first\nmethod being investigated is a photo-electric one and arising\nfrom this we are making a fundamental study of the reflection of\nlight from moving surfaces and\nthe implications that this will have\non the form of the optical system\nrequired for successful correlation\nanalysis.\nNational Physical Laboratory\n(Chemical Process Control)\nWe are collaborating on the\noptimal control of a pilot-scale\nprocess. This is a small-scale\ndistillation column which has been\nset up by the N PL for the purposes of evaluating certain optimisation techniques. The effort\nwill be, devoted initially to the\nplant-modelling problem and later\nto the application of optimal-con-tro l techniques.\nOther problems being< studied\nwhich have an industrial interest\ninclude a study of the boiler startup problem; the influence of\nqueue discipline on traffic control;\nthe development of a high-speed\ndata link to Atlas using a television co-axial cable; and automatic hill-climbing devices for\nmaintaining maximum efficiency\nin plant under varying disturbance\nand load conditions.\nPROFESSOR JUSTIN\nA PROFILE\nProfessor Tustin began his\nindustrial career some fifty years\nago, at the age of sixteen, as an\napprentice with Charles Parsons\nLimited. At that time the firm\nwas engaged in the development\nof the steam turbine, and Professor Tustin spent much of his time\nremoving the irregularities from\nsteel castings with a cold chisel\nand hammer, because modern\nabrasives were not known in\nthose days. The workshop was\ndark, dirty and unpleasant,\nlittered with thrown away food\nand rubbish, and ridden with rats\nand fleas. When the men started\nwork at six o 'clock in the morn-ing, sunlight only penetrated the\ngrimy windows where the panes\nwere broken.\nProfessor Tustin has spent two\nextended periods abroad in dramatically different countries \u2014\nRussia and the U.S.A. He went to\nRussia in 1932 (when the British\nTraction Industry was at a stand-still) to work at the Moscow Traction Works, where he joined a group of engineers, several of\nthem from other countries. At\nthat time i hey were building the\nMoscow Underground Railway\nand were electrifying the main line\nfrom Moscow. Professor Tustiu\nwas much impressed by the enthusiasm and determination which\nalone achieved success at a time\nwhen th :re was a shortage of\nof everyday commodities, even of\npaper to write on. He believes\nthis deter milat ion and perseverance to be responsible foT the\nrapid grow, i of Russia's technology to III; outstanding level of\nachievement he saw when he\nreturn eJ fier e for a short time in\n196C. During the war Professor Tustin was involved in the development of automatic control, particularly automatic gun-laying\nand gyroscopic st a bilis ation. Soon\nafter the war he was appointed\nHead of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Birmingham.\nProtessor Tustin has also been\nto the U.S.A. as a visiting professor at the M.I.T. in 1955, which\ngave him the valuable opportunity\nof assessing American technical\neducation. Of American research,\nhe says that sometimes so much\ntime is spent installing and manipulating elaborate apparatus\nthat not enough thought is given\nto the work being carried out.\nHowever, the resources of men\nand money are so great that this\nfault has not been very important.\nShortly after he returned to\nEngland, Professor Tustin became Head of the Electrical\nEngineering Department at Imperial College\u2014a position which\nhe held until the return of Sir\nWillis Jackson. Professor Tustin\nwelcomed his release from the\nadministration which had curtailed his other activities. Since\nthen, although much of his time\nhas still been taken up with\nproblems concerned with the expansion of the Department and\nadmission of students, he has\nbeen able to devote more time to\nwork in the heavy electrical\nengineering field such as energy\nlosses in electrical machines, and\neconomic aspects of engineering.\nWhen he retires from the College in October next Professor\nTustin will be able to look back\non a long and useful career in\nindustry and teaching. But retirement will not mean the end of\nhis contribution to science, as it\nwill enable him to devote more\ntime to his other interests, one of\nwhich is electrical phenomena in\nthe brain.. His own fertile brain\nwill ensure that he does not lack\nabsorbing problems in his retire-ment.\nP.G. ACTIVITY\nVarious sections of the Department have been organising lectures and seminars during the\nyear. Professor Cherry presented\na series of meetings on \" Social\nAspects of Communication \" and\nMr. Cory has presented a weekly\nseminar on \" Broader Aspects of\nElectricity Supply.\" In addition\nmeetings are held four or five\ntimes a term in which Staff and\nP.G. s can meet informally over\ndrinks and discuss some topic of\ncurrent or general interest. This\nterm, for example. Sir Willis\nJackson has talked about engineering and politics in Africa;\nProfessor Tustin has given his\npersonal impressions of the Slump\nand discussed how such disasters\ncan be avoided in the future; a Ghanian P.G. will later be talking\nabout some problems in his\ncountry. Gradually a picture is\nbeing built up of the engineer in a world of people. Experiment constantly takes place to ensure that\nboth engineering and people\nreceive due attention in the education the Department is seeking\nto provide, for engineering exists\nto serve people and a university\ndepartment should lead the way\nin trying to understand both.\n\n"
