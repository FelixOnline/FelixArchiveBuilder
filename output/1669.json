During\nthis search psychedelics\ndrugs such as LSD were\ndiscovered and tested in\ngovernment-sponsored experiments that took place\nin psychiatric facilities\nacross America, mostly\non college students such\nas Ken Kesey, a 24 year\nold Stanford writing student from Oregon. Once\na week for six months\nat Menlo Park Veteran\u2019s\nHospital, Kesey would\nbe given an ambiguous\npill which would induce\nhallucinatory visions that,\nfor Kesey, crystallised the\ndisturbing practices of\n1950s psychotherapy. He\nbegan to question the very\nconcept of sanity, viewing\nthe men in the hospital\nnot as riddled with mental\nillness, but rather victims\nof social ostracism.\nThey were perceived\nas social abnormalities,\nbranded \u2018crazy\u2019, and were\npsychologically coerced\ninto assimilating within\nthe strict norms of 1950s\nAmerican society. These\nobservations inspired him\nto write one of the most\ninfluential social and governmental criticisms of the\n20th century \u2013 One Flew\nover the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\nThe story details the\nroad to liberation of\nmen from a psychiatric\nfacility that is controlled\nby the tyrannical Nurse\nRatchet. The men are kept\nrepressed by humiliating\ngroup therapy sessions,\nmedication, and physical\nand sexual abuse from\nthe nurses\u2019 aides. Nurse\nRatchet\u2019s dominance is\nchallenged by newcomer\nR.P. McMurphy, who\ninspires a sense of independence in the men,\nleading to their eventual\nemancipation through his\ndisruption of the totalitarian regime.\nChief Bromden, a\nNative American patient,\nnarrates the story, perceiving the hospital as a\nmachine that is working as\npart of a larger socio-eco-nomic conspiracy he describes as the \u201ccombine\u201d\n\u2013 it consumes all in its\npath and homogenises\nanything that is wild. He\nfirst becomes aware of\nthe combine when he is a\n\u201cR. P.\nMcMurphy\nis the\nnightmare of\nthe American\nWASP\u201d \u201cKesey opened\npeople\u2019s\neyes to the\nprofound\nlimitations of\ninstitutional\nconformity\u201d\nyoung boy and the government displaces his tribe\nfrom their native land in\norder to build a hydroelectric dam. The tribe were\nnot contributing anything\nto the American capitalist\nregime, and therefore the\ngovernment destroyed\ntheir natural way of life\nin order to make way for\na means of powering a\nsociety that could ultimately generate profit.\nNurse Ratchet acts as a\ntool for the combine and\nis depicted as robotic and\nlacking any degree of femininity or maternal qualities by Bromden. Her lack\nof sensuality and emas-culative treatment of the\nmen represents the pious\nand puritanical attitudes of\n1950s American society.\nAs an ex-army nurse\nshe runs the ward with\nstrict militaristic routines\nand order, attempting\nto condition the men to\nconform to society outside\nthe hospital. Under her\ncontrol the ward becomes\n\u201ca little world inside that is\na made-to-scale prototype\nof the world outside.\u201d She\nfuels the men\u2019s paranoia,\nturns a blind-eye to the\nsexual abuse experienced\nby them at the hands of\nher aides, and maintains\nan ever present threat\nof brutal electroshock\ntherapy if they step out of\nline.\nMcMurphy is the nightmare of the American\nWASP. A chronic gambler\nof Irish descent who\n\u201cfights and fucks too\nmuch\u201d, he fakes mental\nillness to escape working\nat a penitentiary facility\nand is send to the psychiatric ward. McMurphy\u2019s\nrebellion against the\nstrict social order inspires\nconfidence in the men, and\nthe struggle for dominance\nbetweenhimselfandNurse\nRatchet represents a battle\nbetween natural human\nwildness and oppressive\nsocial constructs. Kesey\nelevates McMurphy onto a\nChrist-like platform: when\nhe defends the men from\nsexual humiliation by\nfighting one off the nurses\u2019\naides, and as a result\nis given electroshock\ntherapy, Kesey describes it\nas a crucifixion.\nBy attacking Nurse\nRatchet towards the end\nof the novel he commits\nmartyrdom. He is given\na lobotomy as result of\nthe attack and put in a\npermanent vegetative\nstate, but the men see\nthis act as a destruction\nof the social order that\nhas oppressed them for\nyears, and feel liberated.\nSome are finally able to\ncheck themselves out of\nthe hospital, and Chief\nBromden finally finds the\nstrength to lift the \u201ccontrol\npanel\u201d out of the ground\nand smash it through a\nhospital window, breaking\nthe transparent barrier that\nexisted between himself\nand natural world outside.\nIn a society where\nnuclear destruction was\nan ever-present looming\nspectre, and young work-ing-class men were being\nforcibly sent to Vietnam to\nkill and die for capitalism,\nKesey clearly saw that\nmadness lay within the\ninstitutions. He continued\nto preach his message\nafter One Flew over the\nCuckoo\u2019s Nest: the novel\nwas an immediate success,\nand Kesey utilised the\nprofits of this success\nto buy a bus, \u201cFurther\u201d,\nwhich he painted in\npsychedelic colours and\ndrove around the country\nwith half a dozen other\nself-titled \u201cMerry Pranksters\u201d and a jar of LSDlaced orange juice. From\nCalifornia to the New\nYork World\u2019s fair they\nspread concepts of love\nand peace, and the trip,\ndescribed by his son as\n\u201cthe start of 60s\u201d, forever\nimmortalised Kesey as a\nprophet of the psychedelic\nrevolution. One Flew over\nthe Cuckoo\u2019s Nest not\nonly opened people\u2019s eyes\nto the profound limitations\nof institutional conform-ity, but also provided the\nauthor with the means to\nshape and fuel America\u2019s\nmost significant counterculture \u2013 the hippie\nmovement.\nKirk Douglas and Joan Tetzel in the stage version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nSEPTEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n26\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nH.G. Wells\u2019 little-known South Ken connection\nBOOKS\nAlice Peberdy\nBooks Editor\nI\nmagine the Imperial\nfreshers of the past;\nponder where their\ncollege career led\nthem. Research is probably\nfirst to mind \u2013 medicine,\nteaching, banking\u2026 Arts?\nWe\u2019re scientists, not\nrobots! Great academics\nare often churned out, but\nour university also produced one of the fathers\nof science fiction, H.G.\nWells.\nA famous student who\nstudied under famous pro-fessors, Wells joined the\nRoyal College of Science\nin 1884. He especially\nenjoyed the subjects of\nzoology and biology\nduring his first year, and\ndid well. These were\ntaught by T.H. Huxley,\n\u201cDarwin\u2019s Bulldog,\u201d who\npassionately supported the\ntheory of evolution. And\nyet student life wasn\u2019t\nentirely plain sailing. \u2013\nWells struggled with other\nsubjects, work-life balance\nand money (despite receiving a scholarship).\nImperial must have\nmade an impact on the\nyoung writer as its surroundings earned a place\nin his 1985 novel, The War\nof the Worlds. It is upon\nthe narrator\u2019s arrival in\nSouth Kensington that the\nclimax of the novel begins.\nIt could be questioned\nwhether the location was\nfeatured through pride\nor the joy of seeing it in\ndisarry, but it is no less\nentertaining to meet a\ncharacter who considers\nbreaking into the Natural\nHistory Museum. Wells\u2019\nrole as a scientist also\nreflected upon the narrator\nand his astronomer friend.\nWhile it\u2019s true most of his\ncharacters have academic\nbackgrounds, The War of\nthe Worlds also drew upon\nreal scientific debates. The\nstory begins with an observation of \u201cstrange lights\u201d\non Mars, a phenomenon\ndescribed in the journal\nNature a year before the\nnovel\u2019s release. The existence of aliens was a hot\ntopic of the time, but Wells\nwas the first to write about\nan invasion. The first page\nof the novel establishes\nthe eerie, unsettling nature\nof the subgenre and is well\nworth a read.\nBefore his novels,\nWells\u2019 began his writing\ncareer while he was still\nstudying and published a\nshort story, The Chronic\nArgonauts, in a college\nmagazine. Science Schools\nJournal was created\nduring his final year and\nhe took the role of its first\neditor. The paper would\nlater become known as\nPhoenix which is still\nprinted today. The Chronic\nArgonauts centred on a\nyoung inventor and his\nmarvellous machine. The\ntale would later be developed into a novel that\nbegan an entire sub-genre\n\u2013 it was called The Time\nMachine. Quite fittingly,\nWells was honoured in a\n1985 episode of Doctor\nWho in which it is revealed\nthat one of the Doctor\u2019s\ncompanions is a young\nversion of the author.\nWells was a true genius\nof science fiction with\nso many more common\ntropes of today appearing\nin his novels: superhuman\nabilities, dystopia, apocalyptic utopia, and space\ntravel to name a few. The\nuse of a familiar setting to\naid the reader\u2019s suspension of disbelief is known\nas \u201cWells\u2019 Law.\u201d Even the\nterm \u201cscience fiction\u201d is all\nthanks to Herbert George.\nAndstillWellsremained\na proficient academic. In\naddition to fiction, the\nauthor published many\nessays and textbooks. One\nremarkable book titled\nThe World Brain describes\nthe vision of a global communication system and\nencyclopaedia \u2013 spookily\nsimilar of the world wide\nweb of today. He believed\nhe had earned himself a\nfellowship with the Royal\nSociety for his contribution to \u201chuman ecology.\u201d\nWhile this was not one of\nhis many achievements,\nWells can be commended\nas a reviewer for Nature\nand his doctorate he\nearned at age 78.\nWells\u2019 legacy can be\nfound in even in some of\nthe most unlikely places;\nhe founded the Diabetes\nAssociation, invented\nthe first recreational war\ngame, and is said to have\ninspired the first liquid\nfuelled rocket. His fame is\ntruly deserved as a master\nof science and science\nfiction alike.\nAformerstudentoftheRoyalCollegeofScience,fatherofsciencefictionH.G.WellsdrewinspirationfromhisSouth\nKensington surroundings, and his legacy remains intimately connected with the College.\n1906 portrait of H.G.

No experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach you\neverything you need to know. If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhen I was elected\nas Editor of Felix, a little\nover six months ago, I set\nmyself one challenge: I\nwouldn\u2019t be writing my\nfirst editorial the day of\nthe print deadline. I was\ngoing to spend time over\nit, painstakingly crafting\na loving piece of work\nabout my time at Imperial\nthus far \u2013 a reflection of\nthe past five years I\u2019ve\nspent here. I was going to\nwax lyrical about my own\nexperiences as a fresher,\nlooking back on how I\nfelt when I first walked\nthrough the doors of\nGabor Hall, went up to my\nroom with my parents, and\nthen watched them wave\ngoodbye before making\nthe perilous trek back to\nTottenham. Who knows,\nthat editorial might even\nhave uncovered some universal truths about leaving\nbehind childhood things,\nforging your own way in\nthe world, or seizing each\nday as it comes.\nBut that was then, and\nthis is now: it\u2019s 9pm,\nan hour before the print\ndeadline for the first issue,\nand I\u2019m typing up these\nwords, powered by gallons\nof Yorkshire tea and a\nsinking feeling of anxiety\nin my stomach. There will\nbe no searing truths, no\ncall to arms \u2013 instead I will\njust share some advice to\nthose reading, many of\nwhom are about to embark\non their time at Imperial.\nIf I could have given\nmy younger self two\npieces of wisdom, the first\none would have been \u2018you\ndo you\u2019. During freshers\u2019\nweek, it\u2019s tempting to get\ninvolved with absolutely\neverything you can, even\nif you\u2019re not particularly\nkeen on playing ring of\nfire for the umpteenth\ntime. It\u2019s natural to feel\nthis way \u2013 you want to\nmake friends, to be seen\nas someone who knows\nhow to have fun. But you\nshouldn\u2019t be afraid of\ndoing what you want: go\nto the cinema alone; go\naround the V&A in your\nlunch break; have some\nsolitary time if you feel\nthat\u2019s what you need.\nThe second piece\nof advice I would give\nmyself would be \u2018don\u2019t\nbe afraid to get involved\u2019.\nBy this I don\u2019t mean sign\nup to every club you can\nat Freshers\u2019 fair (although\nI\u2019m sure this will be true\n\u2013 I\u2019m still getting emails\nfrom Cheese Soc), but\nrather ensure that if there\u2019s\nsomething you\u2019re interested in you pursue it with\ndetermination.\nIt\u2019s a mistake I made\nwith Felix. As a fresher I\nwrote for the Arts section\nnearly every single week,\na habit that continued\ninto my second year, as I\nbranched out into Music\nand Film. I wanted to\nget more involved, to get\nplaced on the editorial\nteam, but I thought that if\nI just waited they would\neventually ask me to join.\nNow I\u2019m on the other\nside, I can most definitely\nassure you that this is not\nthe case. We are always\ncompletely desperate for\nwriters and editors, for\npeople who are willing\nto give up their valuable\ntime, sit down, and create\nwhat you are holding.\nAfter applying to edit\nthe Arts section, I was\ngiven a glimpse behind the\ncurtain, and what I found\nwas not a group of intimidating hacks, competing\nwith each other for the\njuiciest scoop, but rather\nsome of the warmest and\nmost welcoming people\nI\u2019ve ever met. The people\nI\u2019ve met through Felix\nhave become my lifelong\nfriends, my family, and the\nFelix office has become\nlike my home. Barely a\nday goes past when I\u2019m\nnot glad that I made the\nplunge. So get stuck in,\nyou never know where it\nmight lead \u2013 maybe in a\nfew years it will be you\nwriting these words.\nOh, and call your mum.\nShe probably misses you.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\n\n"

We agree.\nRoyal Opera House: ROH Students\nBy registering for ROH Students, you\u2019ll unlock a world of goodies: Over 10,000 dedicated student tickets ranging from \u00a31 - \u00a325; 10 Slips and Standing tickets for every\nmain-stage performance at face value (\u00a34 - \u00a39); 1 complete performance of Swan\nLake next Season; 4 dedicated Amphitheatre performances; 2 tickets for \u00a310 at participating cinemas; dedicated booking days for each Booking Season; Last-minute\n\u00a310 Student Standby tickets; and discounts in bars. That\u2019s probably more than you\ndeserve, frankly.\nThe Old Vic: PwC \u00a310 Previews\nIn partnership with PwC, the Old Vic prices at least half of all their seats for the first\n5 previews for every production. These are released 5 weeks in advance and you\ncan by up to 4 tickets per transaction.

They\u2019re natural\nenemies to the Math\u2019s Watch, constantly covered in\nsomebody\u2019s guts and blood, and they\u2019ll die for their\nfreedom (or their last bottle of buckfast). On top of\nthat, there seem to be thousands of them.\nWildlings - Medics\n\u201cI shall take no wife, father no children, and win no\nglory. I pledge my life and honor to remembering C++,\nfor this night and all the nights to come.\u201d Despite their\nunwashed appearance, and voluntary celibacy, the\nMath\u2019s Watch are basically good people. Even if there\nare very few women among their ranks.\nThe Night\u2019s Watch - Mathematics\nThe alchemists dwell deep below the streets, are\na bit weird, and have this thing about fire. Sound\nfamiliar? Well, we recommend that you keep an\neye on that chemist in your flat, and watch out for\nany suspicious green fluid they might have stashed\naway. Also, the word chemist is literally in the word\nalchemist. Hard-hitting journalism, this.\nAlchemist\u2019s Guild - Chemistry\nLike the Math\u2019s Watch, this ancient guild takes a\nvow of celibacy upon initiation. I\u2019ve heard they add\nanother link to their blockchain for every programming\nlanguage they learn. Though their pursuit of knowledge\nis a selfless one, unfortunately they are destined to serve\nnobler houses (as IT support).\nMaester\u2019s Guild - Computing\nThey have seemingly endless\nwealth, and are situated in a far off\nland. While not at the forefront of\nthe action, these are the true holders of\nPower in Westeros. Need new hockey sticks? A stock\nof wildfire to stash across the walls of King\u2019s Landing\nto burn any prospective besiegers? Minibus to your\nnext inane board game tournament? No problem,\nthey\u2019ve got you covered. Be wary though, the Iron\nBank will have its due.\nThe Iron BankInternational Student\u2019s\nParents\nHiding in plain sight, and not to be trusted. These two\nfaced snakes walk amongst us, and anyone you pass\ncould be one of them (though you\u2019d probably notice\nthe obnoxious blazer and chinos). Most would rather\nunderpay you for working at their startup than skin\nyour face off and wear it to their next careers seminar,\nbut they\u2019re not fussy.\nThe Faceless Men - Imperial Business School\nTall, strong, and hairy, these warriors value strong leadership above all else and are not to be crossed. However,\nit\u2019s far more likely that the rugby team get their horses\nfrom daddy\u2019s stables than the open plains of the Dothraki\nSea, and they prefer to lose the boiled horse-leather tunics\nfor tweed jackets.\nThe Dothraki Horde - ICU Rugby\nNo one really knows what they do, and they have so\nfar been irrelevant.\nShadowlands - Materials\nThe Lannisters - College\nTheir image is that of a wealthy, beautiful elite.

However, while some others stereotype him as a \u201cmad\ndictator\u201d, Kim Jong-un is actually tactically playing a risky game of cat and mouse with the\nWest.\nCOMMENT\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Writer\nN\north Korea, as\na state, adheres\nto the Juche\np h i l o s o p h y.\nCreated by Kim Il-sung,\nthe founding ruler of\nNorth Korea, it expounds\na policy of self-reliance.\nUnder the guiding hand\nof successive members of\nthe Kim dynasty, North\nKorea has moved into the\n21st century as a deeply\nrepressive and secretive\nstate, with its diplomatic\nstandpoint dictated by the\naftermath of the Korean\nwar of 1950-1953 and its\ninability to engage with the\ninternational community\nover its nuclear ambitions.\nNorth Korea has had some\nfocus on nuclear weapons\nas they would allow\nthe Mutually-Assured\nDestruction (MAD) doctrine to come into effect,\nessentially rendering\nthe regime invulnerable\nand \u2013 more importantly\n\u2013 self-sufficient.\nThe drive for nuclear\nweapons has been the\nprinciple reason for it\nappearing in the news on\na near-constant basis over\nthe course of the summer.\nNorth Korea has been\ncompleting rocket tests at\na rate previously unseen,\nas well as detonating a\nhigh yield nuclear device.\nIt has also released images\nof a possibly miniaturised\nnuclear weapon, probably\nsuitable as a payload. This\nrelatively rapid progress\nreflects both the fact that\nthe technology behind\nnuclear weaponry is not\nas advanced as before as\nwell as an increased level\nof investment.\nHowever, it is worth\nconsidering: what does\nNorth Korea need these\nnuclear weapons for, and\nwho are they pointing\nthem at? It is possible\nto make the assumption\nthat all nuclear weapons\nare used as a means of\nself-defence, but in that\ncase against whom?\nIn the past, deterrence,\nagainst the West at least,\nwas achieved by a large\nconcentration of artillery\npieces targeting Seoul, as\nwell as one of the largest\narmies in the world. The\nconsequences of engaging\nwith this force at present\nor in the future for the\nWest would be catastrophe\ncausing mass casualties\nand major disruption if not\ndestruction of one of the\nworld\u2019s largest economies.\nUnity in adversity against\nthe West with its two other\nimmediate neighbours,\nChina and the Soviet\nUnion, now Russia, meant\nthat it did not require a\ndeterrence strategy in that\ndirection. Therefore, why\nthe increased emphasis on\nnuclear weaponry?\nFirstly, there is the new\nman on the block, Kim\nJong-un. He ascended\nto the throne in 2011\nfollowing the death of his\nfather, Kim Jong-il, as a\nrelatively young and inexperienced ruler. His story\nis deserving of at least one\nbrutal Netflix series, but\nthe key events in his path\nto power include his replacing of his half-brother\nKim Jong-nam as the heir\napparent and the conflict\nwith his uncle, Jang Songthaek. These two charac-ters, the former killed by\nVX and the latter by an\nanti-aircraft firing squad\n(North Korean executions\nare imaginative) fuelled\nthe potential instability of\nthe young ruler\u2019s regime\nby allegedly plotting a\ncoup attempt in collaboration with China, which\nwould have replaced Kim\nJong-un with his elder\nbrother. This has reportedly led to a rift opening\nup between Beijing and\nPyonyang, possibly\npersuading Kim Jong-un\nof the need to push for\nnuclear weapons in order\nto render his regime safe\nfrom future meddling.\nThere are further signs of\na rift too, such as China\nattempting to hush up\nnews of the successful\nnuclear test, as well as\nChina\u2019s cooperation with\nthe West in enforcing\nharsher sanctions. He may\nalso wish to cement his\nposition in the pantheon\nof North Korean rulers\nby being the first member\nto have an operational\nnuclear deterrent. The\nNorth Koreans venerate\nthe ruling dynasty, and this\nfulfilment of a part of the\nJuche philosophy would\nfurther validate his reign.\nSecondly, these tests\ncoincide with the large\nmilitary exercises that\nNATO organises at this\npoint in the year. North\nKorea views these exercises as preparation for an\ninvasion and an affront to\nits sovereignty. It probably\nhopes that a fully capable\ndeterrent would demoti-vate the US and its allies\nfrom performing these\ncommunity, and constantly raising the stakes,\nKim Jong-un seems to be\nattempting to force the\nUN to conclude that not\nonly is a nuclear armed\nNorth Korea inevitable,\nbut that it is necessary for\nthese states to engage with\nit in dialogue and to lift\nsanctions.\nThis is dangerous\nbrinkmanship: but it is not\nmad.\nDisclaimer: I have\nreceived no funds from the\nNorth Korean regime, but\nif they wish to subsidise\nme, I am contactable by\nemail for negotiation.\nNo remuneration can\nconvince me to endorse\nKim\u2019s hairstyle.\nThe President\u2019s welcome speech had really taken a different turn this year // Wikimedia\n\u201cKim Jong-un\nseems to be\nattempting to\nforce the UN\nto conclude it\nis necessary to\nlift sanctions.\u201d\nexercises, both from the\nthreat of a strike, and the\nfutility of preparing for an\ninvasion against a nuclear\narmed state.\nFinally, there is North\nKorea\u2019s economic and\nagricultural position. The\nNorth has been struggling\nwith famines since 1994\nand is largely dependent\non external food aid to\nfeed its citizens. In the\npast, the North Korean\nregime has bargained\nwith the suspension of its\nweapons programme in\nreturn for international aid.\nBy keeping the pressure\nup on the international\n\n"

There are loads\nof new things to try, club mailing lists to sign up to, and people to ask\n\u201cWhich Oxbridge college rejected you?\u201d But along the way, it\u2019s important to\nmake sure that you\u2019re taking good care of youself, not only physically, but\nemotionally, mentally, and financially. We\u2019ve teamed up with Ariana SadrHashemi, Mental Health Liberation Officer, to give you the low-down on\nhow to look out for yourself.\nTaking care of your mental health during\nfreshers\u2019week\n1. The beginning of the year is going to bring some massive changes; from meeting more new people\ndaily than you can count, to suddenly drinking copious amounts of alcohol, the last thing on anyone\u2019s\nmind is their mental health. Luckily, taking care of your physical health has the bonus of also benefiting\nyou mentally, so take advantage of Imperial\u2019s free gym to get active \u2013 and try not to have potato waffles\nfor every meal (check out studentrecipes.com for ideas).\n2. Imperial is a high-pressure environment where everyone is ridiculously smart, which makes it a perfect breeding ground for imposter syndrome. Everyone gets it at some point, and you will (like everyone\nelse) eventually prove yourself wrong. However, if it\u2019s affecting your studies or everyday life, don\u2019t be\nembarrassed to talk to someone about it.\n3. You may get sick of having the\u2018Name, Subject, Hall\u2019conversation a bazillion times a day but feel like\nyou can\u2019t duck out of events due to the fear of missing out. In reality, if you miss a few Freshers\u2019 events\nyou\u2019ll still have plenty of opportunities to make friends, so you can afford to take time out for yourself.\n4. Finally, if you aren\u2019t enjoying the Freshers\u2019 events, that\u2019s fine. Parties and heavy drinking aren\u2019t for\neveryone and you haven\u2019t\u2018failed\u2019at being a university student if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s the\u2018Best Thing Ever\u2019\n\u2122.There\u2019s more to the first few weeks than nights out \u2013 if you hate them there are plenty of ways to meet\npeople who will want to befriend you in situations with which you\u2019re more comfortable (check out the\nUnion Society A-Z page for some options).\nThat said, if you are concerned about your mental health, both in Fresher\u2019s fortnight and throughout the\nyear, there are a couple of things you can do. The most important thing is to register with your local GP; the\ncounselling service at Imperial can provide basic counselling \u2013 clue\u2019s in the name \u2013 but nothing beyond that.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with something that\u2019s more than a sudden distressing event, then counselling won\u2019t cut\nit and you should see a GP about your options.\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in contact with your existing support networks: message old friends, call your\nfamily, and ensure that you\u2019ve got people to talk to if you feel like you\u2019re struggling. You can even keep a\ncontact list of emergency services, such as the Samaritans (116 123) or Nightline (020 7631 0101), and draw\nup an emergency plan of who to contact in what order if you\u2019re in a mental health crisis.The College also has\ninformation about other sources of help in the counselling section of their website.\nFinally, make sure to use your support networks if you\u2019re having difficulties. It may not be easy, but taking\nthat first step can be the best decision you make at Imperial.\nWELFARE\nAriana Sadr-Hashemi\nMental Health Liberation\nOfficer\nIt\u2019s important to remember to take care of your mental health,\nespecially at the start of the year. As you fumble your way through\nthe first few weeks, here are some things to bear in mind:\nKeeping safe in the\nsack\nSo, you\u2019re at university now, and chances\nare that, as well as getting a degree, you\nmight get some action along the way. Felix\nis in no way qualified to give out medical\nadvice, but here\u2019s where you can go for\nhelp:\nSTI Clinic: Also known as a GUM (Geni-to-Urinary Medicine) clinic, or just\u201cthe clinic\u201d, these\nare places where you can go along to get tested for\na range of sexually transmitted infections, ensuring\nthat you aren\u2019t passing anything on. Most offer a\ndrop-in service, but it\u2019s best to check online, and\nensure that this is the case. All the information you\nprovide will be kept confidential, and you don\u2019t\nneed to provide them with your real name if you\ndon\u2019t want to. They\u2019ll be able to answer any questions you might have in a non-judgemental, calm\nmanner.\nGP: It\u2019s recommended that you sign up to\na local GP once you\u2019ve moved down to London\nfor university \u2013 you can check online to see your\nnearest surgery. You can attend your GP to ask for\ncontraception \u2013 both regular and emergency \u2013 as\nwell as to get advice about any information you\nmight need about sexual health. They will often\nbe able to point you in the right direction if their\nsurgery doesn\u2019t offer what you need.\nFamily Planning Clinics: Similar to\nthe STI clinic, these may have walk-in sessions, but\nit\u2019s always best to check beforehand. They often\noffer a wide range of services, from emergency\nand regular contraception (including condoms),\nto pregnancy testing and advice about concep-tion. Some clinics will also offer more specialised\nservices, such as gynaecology clinics, and abortion\nreferral, but again, it\u2019s best to check what your\nnearest centre offers.\nMind on my money, money on my mind\nFood: Being thrifty with your food is one of the best ways you can reduce how much you spend whilst at university. The\ninternet can be a fantastic resource, with websites like BBC Good Food having a wealth of cheap recipes. Some food writers\nalso specialise in cost-efficient cooking, such as Jack Monroe, whose easy recipes are all cost-tested, or Meera Sodha, who\nspecialises in vegetarian Indian cookery. Going vegetarian (or flexitarian) is also a great way to reduce costs - just ensure you\u2019re\ngetting all the nutrients you need!\nFinances can have a bearing on so much that you do at university. Constantly\nworrying about where your money is going can be a source of anxiety for many\nstudents. Luckily, Felix is here with some steps you can take to cut down on\nspending, and places you can turn to for help:\nTravel: While London is a big city, it is really very walkable. Apart from those living in Woodward Buildings, most of you in halls should be able to walk to South\nKensington - just avoid walking through Hyde Park after dark. If you do need to make regular journeys, then ensure you have an 18+ student oyster card, which can\nsave you 30% on season tickets, and consider getting a 16-25 railcard: if you connect it to your oyster card you only pay off-peak fares.\nEntertainment: A lot of things in London are expensive, but getting your cultural fix needn\u2019t be! Many theatres offer very competitively priced seats for young\npeople, and nearly all art galleries will offer student discounts for exhibition entry. And that\u2019s not even mentioning the museums on our doorstep, which are free\n(there\u2019s a suggested donation, but the hint\u2019s in the word:\u2018suggested\u2019). Cinemas like the BFI Southbank and the ICA also offer great prices for students.\nHalls life: Before you move into halls, it\u2019s likely that most people will take a little trip to that giant blue and yellow wonderland, IKEA. Now, I realise this might be\ncoming too late for some of you, but really consider what you need when you load up on supplies. Hall kitchens aren\u2019t terrible, but it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be cooking\nup any feasts, so put down the aeropress and the pie dish, and just think about getting a few pans and baking trays. You can always stock up on more if you need it,\nbut overpack and chances are most of your equipment will remain languishing in a cupboard.\nSupport: For some people, despite endless budgeting, there will still be problems when it comes to meeting costs. It\u2019s important to remember that Imperial offers a number of avenues of support, and that you should never be afraid to ask for a little extra help rather than suffer in silence. As well as a number of scholarships\non offer, the Imperial Bursary can offer financial support to those with a household income of under \u00a360,000. There\u2019s also the Student Support Fund, which offers\ngrants and loans to students who are struggling - they only offer them to students who apply, however, so don\u2019t leave it until you\u2019re on your last can of baked beans\nto get in touch.\nLet\u2019s get physical (and spiritual, and emotional)\nEthos: Here at Imperial there\u2019s a fully equipped gym for students and staff. There\u2019s a \u00a340 induction fee, but that\u2019s\npocket change if you compare it to even the monthly price of a lot of private gyms in west London. As well as the gym and\nswimming facilities, you can purchase a monthly pass for the classes for \u00a314.50, which lets you go to any sessions you want,\nranging from yoga to spin. For a lot of people, the gym can be an intimidating place, but there\u2019s enough on offer at Ethos for\nmost students to find something they enjoy. There are also gyms at other campuses, like St Mary\u2019s and Charing Cross, as well\nas iGym at Woodward Buildings.\nTaking good care of yourself physically doesn\u2019t necessarily mean 6am work-outs\nand protein diets; it\u2019s about ensuring that you\u2019re doing the things that make you\nfeel good, whether that\u2019s getting a good night\u2019s sleep, or being able to ask for help\nwhen you need it. Here\u2019s the Felix guide to looking after yourself:\nSleep: Establishing a healthy sleeping pattern is one of the most valuable things you can do as a student. Not only does being\nwell-rested mean that your physical health improves, but it also works wonders for your mental health and concentration. We\u2019ve all been there: you\u2019ve crammed for\nan exam the night before, struggled through with a few hours of sleep, and now you can barely focus, let alone learn anything. Do yourself a favour \u2013 turn off your\nscreens before you go to bed; avoid caffeine after lunch; and try and avoid watchingTV or eating in bed. Conner Qiu, Campaigns Liberation Officer, is running a Sleep\nImperial campaign this year, which launches at midday, 13 November, in the Chaplaincy.\nHealthy Eating: When planning a weekly shop, most of us go for convenience and price as priorities, with nutrition falling behind. However, it\u2019s possible to\nmake food that is quick, cheap, and healthy \u2013 look for vegetables that are in season, which will be easier on the wallet, the environment, and your palate. Keep up a\nstash of fruit, so you\u2019re never left without anything to munch on. And make sure to keep a couple of quick and healthy recipes to hand, so you can carry on looking\nafter yourself even when you\u2019re snowed under with lab reports.\nDisability Advisory Service: When many people think of what\u2018disability\u2019is, they think of people with physical, visible disabilities \u2013 those in wheel-chairs, or who have difficulty walking. However, the definition of disability is incredibly broad, including both physical and mental spheres, and disability may be\nvisible or non-visible. For students who believe that they may have a disability, the Disability Advisory Service (DAS) can be an invaluable source of help. As well as\nproviding support, they are able to show students where they might be able to get more assistance \u2013 should they so need it \u2013 including catering to accommodation\nrequests and providing assistive technology. Located in the Sherfield Building, they can easily be contacted online.\n\n"

You quickly accept\nyour fate and move in,\nunderstanding that it is\ngoing to take you ages to\nget anywhere.\nBut it\u2019s all not as bad as\nit seems: after spending an\nhour and a half together\neach day, you\u2019ll create\ngreat friendships with\nthose you commute in\nwith. Conversations\nwill naturally pause\nmid-sentence during the\nminute-long screeching of\nthe rails between Holland\nPark and Notting Hill Gate\nand then, without hesita-tion, continue like nothing\nhappened. An introduction\nto Citymapper and you\u2019ll\nfall in love: this app is\nthe commuter\u2019s bible and\nyou\u2019ll preach it to anyone\nwho hasn\u2019t heard of it.\nIn early minglings with\nnon-Woodward students\nyou may encounter the\nWoodward prejudice,\nwhere you\u2019ll be an object\nof both sympathy and\nridicule. Their feelings\nwill eventually turn\nto envy, whether they\nwant to admit it or not,\nfollowing a pre-drinking\nsession where they see\nyour superior panoramic\nkitchen, double bed, and\nensuite at \u00a3100 less a week\nthan what they\u2019re paying.\nAs a Woodwardian, you\nwill face a certain number\nof dilemmas: whether ot\nnot to take a coat, which\nmay seem trivial to others,\nwill be a common debate\namongst your peers. Do\nyou risk being wet all\nday after your rainy walk\nacross Hyde Park, or be\ndry but sweat out your\nbodyweight on the tube\nand have the annoyance of\ncarrying it around all day?\nThe answer is unclear.\nOther rigorous debates\ninclude which way to uni\nis fastest: to get off and\nuse the circle line or to\nwalk from Queensway\nor Lancaster gate? This\ndepends on walking speed\nand circle line timings;\nCitymapper to the rescue.\nAlso, don\u2019t be fooled\nby the notion that you\u2019ll\nbe able to do extra work\nwhilst commuting. This\nis a lie and deserves to\nbe debunked: there is no\nroom for book reading at\npeak time and you won\u2019t\nfeel like it anyway after a\nfull day of lectures/labs.\nThe 1.5 hours will unpro-ductively vanish out of\nyour day \u2013 although you\nmight create some sweet\nSpotify playlists.\nThe night tube will\nleave you in both disbelief and delight as you\nwatch drunk people zip\nacross the city. Whether\nit\u2019s the sweet, wine-like\naroma migrating along\nthe carriage from a puke\ncovered 50-year-old, or\na couple having an awkwardly public break up,\nthere\u2019s usually something\nto see as you attack your\nchicken nuggs/kebab on\nthe way back to North\nNorth Acton McDonalds.\nYou\u2019ll have a great year,\ngood luck.\nYou better pray you get a penthouse view // Imperial\n\u201cDespite\nWoodward\u2019s\ndrawbacks,\nit can be nice\nto experience\nlife outside\nof the South\nKen bubble\nsometimes\u201d\nActon.

It was organised\nby a White Nationalist\nto protest the planned\nremoval of a statue of\nAmerican Confederate\ngeneral Robert. E. Lee,\nand resulted not only in\nheated conflict, but the\ntragic death of a young\ncounter-protestor. For\nme, this episode, and the\nensuing furore, was disturbing for two reasons.\nThe first was, obviously,\nthe gun-toting Nazis; the\nsecond, however, was\nthe response of some\nprotesting students and a\ndisparate group known as\n\u2018Antifa\u2019 \u2013 Anti-Fascists.\nIn numerous locations\nacross the country, these\nactivists illegally defaced\nand sometimes forcibly\nremoved statues they\ndidn\u2019t like. At the University of Virginia, students\nclambered onto a statue\nof Thomas Jefferson \u2013 one\nof the Founding Fathers \u2013\nand placed a black shroud\nover it, branding it racist.\nIn Baltimore, a statue of\nChristopher Columbus,\nthe Italian explorer, was\nattacked by activists\nwielding sledgehammers,\nand a statue of Francis\nScott Key, an anti-ab-olitionist lawyer, was\nvandalised. Numerous\nother statues have been\nsimilarly defaced, all in\ncomplete violation of\nthe law. Even more dis-turbingly, Vice published\nan online article that put\nforward an argument that\nit was perfectly ok to\npunch neo-Nazis in the\nface.\nWhen did it become\nacceptable to arbitrarily\nbreak the law to pursue\nyour own agenda? I think\nninety percent of the \u2018art\u2019\nin the Tate Modern is junk,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m\nentitled to burn the place\ndown. I\u2019m not trying to\nsuggest \u2018moral equivalence\u2019 of the beliefs of the\nNazis and those of Antifa\n(and neither did Trump)\n\u2013 I\u2019m merely saying that\nneither one has the right\nto break the law to further\ntheir own agenda. Such\nbehaviour is not only\ntotally unacceptable in a\nliberal society, but it runs\ncounter to the very ideals\nthat Antifa stand for. They\nof the law, upholding\nthe values of intellectual\ndiversity and peaceful\nprotest.\nAnother upsetting example of this\nattitude emerged as Len\nMcClusky, the far-left\nleader of Unite, said he\nwould break the law to\nhold a strike protesting\nthe public sector pay cap.\nAside from the fact that\neducation and experience\nequivalent staff salaries\nare higher in the public\nsector than in the private\nsector, what McCluskey\nis saying is that he doesn\u2019t\nreally give a damn about\nwhat anyone else thinks,\nbecause he knows he\u2019s\nright and so he is in some\nway above the law.\nI do appreciate the\nargument that, sometimes,\nbreaking the law is the\nright thing to do, such\nas those people who\nsmuggled slaves illegally\ninto Canada to freedom.\nWith the Confederate\nstatues, however, the\nargument simply falls\ndown: there is a perfectly\nlegitimate, legal process\nfor communities to\nremove statues if they\nsee fit, something that has\nsuccessfully and peacefully happened in numerous\nplaces across the country;\nthere is no excuse whatsoever to break the law.\nFundamentally, I am not\ntrying to draw a parallel\nbetween the moral standpoints of anyone on either\nside of any argument; I\nam merely frustrated at\nthose who, no matter their\nintentions, muddy the\nwaters of healthy debate\nand positive activism by\nbreaking the law to further\ntheir own agenda.\nL\net\u2019s get this\nstraight: Antifa\nis not some\ngroup of recently\npost-pubescent students\nwith an inherent hatred\nof bronze figures. Antifa\naction is, in principle,\ntaken up to fight against\nviolence or intolerance\nby fascists (a.k.a. racist/\nnationalist scumbags).\nWhilst I\u2019ll applaud\nBaltimore\u2019s mayor Catherine Pugh for promptly\nremoving all the confederate statues from the city\nin response to the Unite\nthe Right rally, that saw\na woman lose her life to\na white-supremacist with\nroad rage, the reality is that\nthe rest of the country has\nnot caught on. Protections\nare already widespread\nand growing (with dull\nnames like the \u201cAlabama\nMemorial Preservation\nAct\u201d) for monuments that\nglorify those who rejected\nthe right of slaves to be\ntreated like human beings.\nNo wonder that some\npeople have decided to\ntake matters into their own\nhands, since the democratic governments that should\nbe taking them down have\ngone in the complete\nopposite direction.\nLet\u2019s acknowledge that\nthese are not just statues\nthat objectively inform us\nof our checkered past, but\nmonuments with inscriptions like \u201cIn memory of\nthe boys who wore gray\u201d\nas a symbol of admiration for their efforts. To\ncontinue to protect these\nmemorials that revel in\nfalse heroism is misguided\nif done in the name of historical preservation, since\nnobody is suggesting an\nen masse burning of confederate historical files.\nThe fact that the KKK and\nNazi sympathisers have\ntaken to prancing around\nstatues whilst threatening\nglobal genocide shows\nthe level of bizarreness\nwe have reached 70 years\nafter laws were put in\nplace to prevent just this\nsort of thing.\nNow, a word of caution:\neven though Antifa in the\nUS is much more of a\nmovement than a general\nidea, as it is over here in\nthe old world (with the\noriginal German anti-fascists just dressing up\nin black to bash in some\nnazi skulls), it\u2019s still not\nright to think of Antifa as\none group. They certainly\ndon\u2019t have a leader akin\nto a prime minister or a\nCEO. Nobody\u2019s making\ndecisions that everyone\nhas to follow blindly, and\nI guarantee you anyone\nwho tried wouldn\u2019t last\nvery long. You\u2019ll have a\nmuch better time understanding how this works\nwhen you understand that\nAntifa is an idea \u2013 the\nprinciple \u2013 that sometimes\nthe best way to deal with\nwhite supremacists, the\nKKK, and neo-Nazis is\nto actually get up out of\nour armchairs, go beyond\nchecking a box on a piece\nof paper every five years,\nand physically stop them.\nThe law might not allow\nfor it, but laws that have\nfailed to stop a new wave\nof fascism are laws that\nhave failed.\noppose people who are\nintolerant of the ideas and\nbeliefs of others, but they\nseem to feel as if it is ok\nfor them to ignore the\nrule of law and carry out\ntheir self-devised justice.\nThis has nothing to do\nwith whether or not the\nstatues should be removed\n\u2013 personally, I think that\nthey should be \u2013 but the\nfact is that, no matter the\nperceived nobility of the\ncause, all members of\nsociety should debate and\nreason within the confines\n\u201cAntifascists\nare ignoring\nthe rule of law\nand carrying\nout their\nself-devised\njustice\u201d\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\u201cSmash the fash!\u201dor\u201clet\u2019s all get along\u201d? // Flickr/Roberto Taddeo\n\n"

It is believed that ground zero\nof the outbreak is Beit\nQuadrangle, although\nsince then the infestation\nhas spread to a number\nof sites across west London, including the Junior\nCommon Room, Imperial Library\u2019s second floor,\nand Woodward Halls in\nActon. It is unclear the\nextent of the spread,\nbut experts believe that\nonly the \u2018Blue Cube\u2019\nFaculty Building and\nthe Business School are\ncompletely unaffected.\nLast Monday, Nick\nSmith, newly-appoint-ed Vice Provost (Pest\nControl), spoke briefly to\nthe media whilst dressed\nin biohazard protective\ngear. He urged those\nlistening that everything\nwas \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d,\nand called for calm, before\nmaking a hasty retreat into\nthe hermetically-sealed\nBlue Cube, which has\nbeen on lockdown for the\npast week.\nIn a follow up statement\nfrom Imperial communi-cations, a representative\nfrom the College said\n\u201cProblems? What prob-lems? Absolutely nothing\nis wrong. Have you seen\nhow well we did in the\nGood University Guide by\nthe way?\u2019\nHowever, internal\ndocuments that were\nleaked to Felix reveal that\nthe College has begun a\nradical fight back against\nthe infestation, and are\nplanning on hiring exterminators to forcibly move\nthe infestation to White\nCity. The plan, \u201cProposal\nfor Removal Of Freshers\nIn Totality\u201d \u2013 nicknamed\nPROFIT \u2013 involves construction of a new containment site in the wastelands\nof Zone 2; the nature of the\nproject is unclear, but the\nproposal seems to suggest\nthat the infestation can be\ndomesticated using something called the \u2018Imperial\nWhite City Incubator\u2019.\nThe proposal says that\nwhen the new site has been\nbuilt, \u201cImperial staff will\nbe able to go about their\ndaily business of producing world-class research in\npeace, without having to\nworry about petty things\nlike NSS scores or cooked\nbreakfasts\u201d. The project\nwill be overseen by Vice\nProvost (PROFIT Driver),\na role that has not yet been\nassigned.\nOne academic, who\nasked not to be named, told\nFelix about their narrow\nescape: \u201cI was packing\nup my stuff, getting ready\nto leave the office, when\nsuddenly the door was\nblocked by two of the crea-tures. They started asking\nme questions about the\n\u2018undergraduate syllabus\u2019,\nand \u2018reading lists\u2019 \u2013 I had\nno idea what they were\nsaying, but it all sounded\nvery intimidating. Luckily\nour department has got a\nnew student-staff liaison\nofficer, so I was able\nto point them down the\ncorridor and they left as I\nmade my escape. Was the\nsacrifice worth it?

You should dive\nin both feet first, and give the sports clubs a go!\nSPORTS\nImraj Singh\nSports Editor\nI\n\u2019ll be the Sports\nEditor for Felix\n2017/18, and want\nto encourage you to\ntry sport. With 60+ sports\nclubs to choose from\nits often hard to figure\nout what sport you\u2019d be\ninterested in trying. From\nsports that require more of\na soft touch rather than a\nhard hit, that are team or\nindividual, or more social\nthan hardcore training. It\u2019s\noften hard for incoming\n(or returning) students\nto figure out what to try\nwhen surrounded with so\nmany options. After playing 3 years of American\nFootball (in Edinburgh\nand Kent, reaching the\nBritish Championships\nfor the first time in each\nof the teams\u2019 histories) I\nwas delighted to find that\nImperial had their own\nteam. I was very keen, and\nemailed prior to starting\nat Imperial, making sure\nto free up the appropriate\ntrial day. When my time\nat Imperial did start it was\nmadness, fresher\u2019s week is\nstill somewhat of a blurry\nrecollection. I never did\nattend that initial training\nsession. A classic fresher\u2019s\ntrip to Ministry (or a halls/\nunion event, I can\u2019t really\nremember) left me rather\nrough and irritated at the\neven the prospect of going\noutdoors.\nI did manage to trial\nanother day, and have\nplayed for two years with\nthe team. I have played, or\nat least tried, most sports\nthroughout high school\n\u201cEven if you\ndon\u2019t want to\ntake sport too\nseriously you\ncan participate\nin super fun\nsocial teams\u201d \u201cI have met\nmany people\nwho have\nregretted not\ntaking up\nsport earlier at\nImperial\u201d\nin and of itself should\nencourage the reader to\npursue physical endeav-ours. For sports in particu-lar, I have met a lot more\npeople who have regretted\nnot taking up sport earlier,\nthan people who were\ndespondent after realising\nthe sport wasn\u2019t for them.\nI should note it is rare\nto have prior university\nAmerican Football experience in the Imperial team.\nThat is the same with most\nImperial teams (especially\nso with less mainstream\nsports). Do not be afraid\nto try new sports if you\nhaven\u2019t done it before.\nSports clubs want you to\ncome along and develop\nyou into an athlete. Even\nif you don\u2019t want to take\nsport too seriously you can\nparticipate in social teams\nwhich are super fun too!\nTo get a most complete\nexperience of university\nI would argue that doing\nsport is a necessity.\nWith regards to the\nMedics and IC clubs, there\nis only a limited amount\nof guidance I can give. I\nknow that medics can join\nIC clubs, and vice versa.\nAs to why to choose one\nclub over the other when\nthey do the same sport, I\nam less sure... Committees\nchange, coaches change,\nopinions change, so what I\nsay is try out the clubs. If\nyou find one of the clubs is\ntoo socially orientated and\nyou want to be more sport\norientated then try the\nother club, and vice versa.\nIf you are in a medic club\nyou will find yourself\nusually in Reynolds for\nsports night, whilst IC\nteams will find themselves\nin the Union. That\u2019s about\nit...\nIf you are interested\nin going for a team trial\nsee the timetable extract\nbelow. The trials are jam-packed into one day. If you\nfind yourself unable attend\nget in contact with the club\nand they will probably\nhave other sessions.\n\u201cSiri, please find me a picture of a\u2018sports\u2019\u201d // Flickr/Schwarz Johann\nETHOS TEAM\nTRIALS\nFancy trying your\nhand at a new sport?\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going\non on team trials day,\nOctober 4th.

With no background knowledge, the word seems innocuous enough\n\u2013 the latest breakfast cereal perhaps? However, this now-infamous word\nand all it represents have been the talk of the town for the past year and a\nhalf. This summer, you\u2019ve used it to screen prospective suitors on a first date,\nbeen asked about it on your travels by fellow Europeans, and discussed it\nwith home friends you hadn\u2019t seen all year. Relationships have unravelled,\npolitical allegiances probed, and memes made from the word. Brexit has\ninfiltrated every part of your life, and so, the next time the topic crops up in\nconversation (probably within the next 24 hours), let\u2019s make sure you know\nwhatyou\u2019retalkingaboutasyougracealuckysoulwithyouropinion.Here\u2019s\nwhat you need to know:\nNEWS\nRatan Gor\nNews Writer\nTrade \u2013 the Single\nMarket, the Customs\nUnion, and the European Economic Area\nT\nhe question as\nto whether the\nUK should stay\nin or leave the\nEuropean Single Market\nhas been at the forefront\nof Brexit discussions but\nwhat exactly is it and why\ndoes it matter?\nThe EU Single Market\nis a trade agreement that\nseeks to guarantee the\nfree movement of goods,\ncapital, services, and\nlabour within it \u2013 termed\n\u2018the four freedoms\u2019. It\nconsists of the 28 EU\nmembers as well as\nIceland, Liechtenstein,\nand Norway who have\naccess through the\nEuropean Economic Area\nagreement, whereby they\nimplementEUlawsrelated\nto the four freedoms in\nexchange for access.\nBeing part of the\nEuropean Customs Union\nmeans that goods crossing\nnational borders aren\u2019t\nsubject to tariffs, such as\nthe common tariff placed\non imports to the EU from\nnon-EU countries. It also\nmeans that member states\naren\u2019t allowed to create\ntheir own trade agreements with other nations.\nWell, this is awkward... // Wikimedia\nJust what are tariffs anyway?\nTariffs provide countries with a source of\nrevenue, whilst also protecting domestic\nindustries from foreign competitors who\nmay be able to produce something for less\n\u2013 either because of lax regulation in areas\nsuch as workers\u2019rights and environmental\nprotections, or simply because they are more\nefficient at producing a product. Either way,\nimported goods become more expensive\nwith tariffs, making them less competitive in\na market.\nSome feel the single\nmarket should be the\nchief focus of the UK\u2019s\nnegotiations with the EU\nas it is widely perceived to\nbe a positive feature of the\nEuropean Union from the\nstandpoint of businesses\nand prosperity. Staying\nin it would preserve the\ncurrent friction-free trade\nwith the EU \u2013 Britain\u2019s\nbiggest trading partner\n\u2013 in goods but more importantly in services, upon\nwhich the bulk of the UK\neconomy is based.\nThe Tories want a\n2-year transitional period,\nafter officially leaving the\nEU, where there would\nstill be access to the\nsingle market and during\nwhich a new UK-EU trade\ndeal would be devised.\nTheresa May has said that\nthe UK is willing to pay\n\u20ac20 billion for such an\nagreement, which the EU\nhas said is insufficient.\nApparently the so-called\n\u201cNorway model\u201d was con-sidered, whereby the UK\nwould pay to remain in the\nEuropean Economic Area\nin the long-run. However,\nthis model now appears\nto be off the table after\nstaunch opposition from\nhard-line Brexiteers who\ndismiss the single market\nas a hindrance that should\nbe escaped \u2013 the so-called\n\u2018hard Brexit\u2019.\nLabour\u2019s official\nposition is that the UK\nshould remain in the single\nmarket during a four-year\ntransition period. They\nwere one of the first to\npropose such an approach.\nSome from the party,\nhowever, further insist\nthat the UK should remain\nin the single-market indefinitely as \u201cthe supposed\nbenefits of a clean break\nwith the EU are a fantasy\u201d.\nAccess during a transi-tionperiod,asinbothcases\nabove, would almost certainly require abiding by\nthe four freedoms. Therefore, the free movement\nof people would remain\nas it is; regulations would\nstill align with those of the\nEU; the European Court\nof Justice\u2019s rulings would\nstill apply; and the UK\nwould still pay into the EU\nbudget. All this, whilst not\nbeing able to influence the\nlaws and regulations that\nwould apply to it.\nWere such a transition\nperiod to become indefinite or Britain decided\nto maintain membership\nto the single market and\ncustoms union some\nwould argue the UK would\nbe worse off than if it were\na member. The Liberal\nDemocrats, therefore,\npropose a potential \u201cexit\nfrom Brexit\u201d and want\nthe public to vote on the\nfinal deal with the option\nto stay in Europe if they\ndon\u2019t like it.\nWhy was chlorinated\nchicken in your news\nfeed?\nShould the UK leave\nthe single market and start\nforging its own trade deals\nacross the globe, a subsequent change (slackening)\nin regulatory standards\nmay follow, which could\nmean that goods on the\nmarket are of a different\n(lower) standard to what\nthey are now. It appears\nthat chlorinated chicken\nhas become the poster\nchild for this laxity in regulation that might ensue,\nwhich some believe would\nbe worse for the consumer.\nIn this particular case, it\nmight mean that your fried\nchicken might\u2019ve taken\na dip in chlorine before\nsatisfying your post night-out munchies because of\na trade deal with the US\nwho want to sell such\nmeat in Britain.\nLaw: The European\ncourt of justice and\nthe great repeal bill\nThe European court of\njustice (ECJ) is the highest\ncourt in the European\nUnion. Judges from\nmember states interpret\nEU law and make rulings\naccordingly. They are the\nhighest court in the Union\nand can issue rulings over\nnational courts. Its decisions are made in public\nand detailed reasoning is\noffered on decisions, and\nso, the ECJ is thought to\nbe largely good at what it\n\u201cTrade experts\nclaim that a\nseamless UKIreland border\nwould be\nimpossible if\nthe UK leaves\nthe single\nmarket\u201d\nThe European Parliament: public enemy number one for the Brexiteers // Wikimedia\nto the UK. For example,\nEU law would refer to EU\ninstitutions, which Britain\nwould no longer be a part\nof. Such nuances would\nbe incredibly important\nto address. It has been\nsaid that the bill is likely\nto be \u201cone of the largest\nlegislative projects ever\nundertaken in the UK\u201d.\nIn its current form,\nthe bill gives the government the ability to make\n\u201ccorrections\u201d to the laws\nwithout any involvement\nor scrutiny from parlia-ment. Many see this as a\n\u201cnaked power grab\u201d and\ndo not want the bill to\npass without amendments\nto prevent this and for\nparliament to be consulted\non changes that might be\nmade.\nThe Irish border\nThe border between the\nRepublic and Northern\nIreland will be the only\nland border between\nthe UK and the EU post\nBrexit. Currently, it is virtually invisible, meaning\nthat goods, services, and\npeople (up to 30,000 per\nday) can move between\nthe two countries totally\nunhindered.\nA \u201cseamless, friction-less border\u201d remains the\nend-goal for the current\ngovernment. However,\ntrade experts claim that\nthis would be impossible\nif the UK leaves the single\nmarket as Ireland would\nhave to \u201capply EU law\nwith no choice but to have\ncustoms checks on the\nborder\u201d.\nFor instance, it might\nmeanthatvehiclescarrying\ngoods between the two jurisdictions would now be\nstopped and taken through\na border check \u2013 adding\nto a business\u2019s expenses.\nOther issues also arise\nand include those surrounding the taxation of\ngoods such as cigarettes;\nthe movement and manufacturing of milk-based\nproducts; and the production of Guinness, which\ncrosses the border twice\nbefore being shipped off\nto a pub near you.\nThe divorce bill: show\nme the money\nKnown officially as\nthe \u2018reste \u00e0 liquider\u2019, the\nBrexit \u2018divorce bill\u2019 is the\nsum of the UK\u2019s financial\nobligations to the EU\nwhich was agreed upon in\nthe past, and have yet to be\npaid. It is separate to the\n\u20ac20 billion mentioned previously that was proposed\nfor continued access to the\nEU single market. Like\nwith any divorce, defining\nthe amount of money has\nbecome a heated issue\nbetween the UK gov-ernment, other political\nparties and the EU.\nGargantuan figures\nestimating the bill have\nlittered the headlines\nleading to unfriendly and\nconflicting discourse on\nall sides. Estimates have\nranged from \u20ac40 billion to\nas much as \u20ac100 billion.\nThe money relates to\nprevious pledges the UK\nhas made towards the\nEU budget; infrastructure\nprograms such as for roads\nand railways; investment\nprojects; and other long-term liabilities that might\nremain. The UK government have said they recognise prior commitments\nthat should be honoured\nbut have stopped short of\nfleshing out the details and\nvalue of such obligations.\nThe amount will likely\nbe subject to the future\nrelationship the UK has\nwith the EU after 2019.\nFor example, if the UK\ndecides to stay in certain\nprogrammes such as\nErasmus for students,\nor a particular scientific\nresearch organisation,\nthe bill would likely be\nlowered accordingly.\nCitizens\u2019rights\nCitizens\u2019 rights are\nrights and protections for\nall EU citizens under EU\nlaw. They include free\nmovement and residence,\nequal treatment, and rights\nrelated to work, education,\nand health.\nIt is one of the most\npolitically-charged issues\nin the Brexit debate. Some\nclaim that the referendum\nresult mandated new rules\non immigration from the\nEU but others completely\noppose such an interpretation of the result, and cite\nhave said that people will\nnot be used as bargaining\nchips in discussions and\nthat all would be treated\nfairly; however, there\nhave been a number\nof high-profile cases\nmounting up evidence to\nthe contrary.\nLong-standing residents and those lawfully\nliving in the country have\nbeen threatened with\npersecution. A recent case\ninvolved a researcher from\nOxford, who had been\nstaying in the country\nlegally, with a valid work\nvisa, for 10 years but nevertheless was sent a letter\nrevoking certain rights\nand telling him to leave.\nHe was sent an apology\n\u2013 however, this wasn\u2019t an\nisolated case. Last month\nfor example, the Home\nOffice mistakenly sent\nup to 100 letters to EU\nnationals living in the UK\nordering them to leave the\ncountry or face deporta-tion. This all whilst the\nUK has yet to leave the\nEU\n\u00a7\nSo there\u2019s your whis-tle-stop tour on some of\nthe main points on Brexit.\nNow its for you to read-up\naround the topic, develop\nideas and formulate your\nown opinions on the\nmatter, but remember, it\u2019s\npolite to offer earplugs\nbefore expressing them to\nan unsuspecting peer.\ndoes. Once the UK leaves\nthe EU, the ECJ would\ntheoretically not have such\npowers, although, should\nBritain wish to maintain its\naccess to the single market\nthen European laws and\nECJ rulings related to this\nwould likely still apply.\nThe EU withdrawal bill,\nalso known as the great\nrepeal bill, is a piece of\nlegislation that essentially\ncopies and pastes EU\nlaw into UK law to try\nand avoid disruption on\nthe day Britain actually\nleaves. This, however, is\nnot as simple as it might\nfirst appear. Lots would\nhave to be amended for it\nto make sense in relation\n\u201cLast month\nthe Home\nOffice sent up\nto 100 letters\nto EU nationals\nin the UK\nordering them\nto leave\u201d\nhow migration benefits the\nUK, economically, cultur-ally, and socially.\nSecuring the rights of\n3.5 million residents from\nother member states in the\nUK and 1.2 million Brits\nin Europe has been stated\nas one of the top priorities\nfor both sides. Politicians\n\n"

Or maybe you\u2019ve been here a while but you\u2019re looking for a way to save some money,\nstay healthy, and just have fun. Or maybe you need a plan now that Uber are potentially on the rocks... Here is a\ntotally incomprehensive list of how to stay safe and enjoy cycling in London\u2026\nSPORTS\nJoeseph O\u2019ConnellDanes\nSports Writer\n1. The Bike\nIf you are going to\nbe cycling regularly in\nLondon, Boris bikes aren\u2019t\nreally a feasible solution.\nThe best thing about\nbuying a bike for London\nis that it\u2019s flat! This opens\nup a huge range of possibilities in terms of what\nyou buy. My personal\nrecommendation is to get\nyourself a single speed or\ncheap road/hybrid bike,\nfrom a reputable company.\n2. Helmets\nJust wear one. Trust me.\n3. Locks\nSo you have your\ndream bike in London that\nlooks super cool, and you\ncan\u2019t wait to tear up the\ncycle superhighways, but\nthis is all going to be very\nshort-lived if you don\u2019t get\nproper locks. A general\nrule of thumb for London\nis to have two locks: a\nD-lock (the university\nsecurity does a pretty good\ndeal on these) for your\nframe and back wheel, and\na cable lock for your front\nwheel and saddle (yes\npeople in London steal\nsaddles, it sucks).\n4. Punctures\nThese suck. Well\u2026\nblow. The last thing you\nwant when you\u2019re rushing\nfor your 9am lecture (ha)\nor labs is to get a puncture\nand be stood on the side\nof the road with no way\nto get where you\u2019re going.\nFirstly, learn how to mend\na puncture. Secondly,\nget some tougher tires.\nI like going quickly as\nmuch as the next person,\nbut a slightly tougher tire\nwon\u2019t slow you down\nmuch on your commute.\nGet some GatorSkins or\nsome Schwalbe Marathons \u2013 they are genuinely\namazing and will fend\noff all but the toughest\nLondon junk.\n5. What to wear\nFor those of you how\ndidn\u2019t already know, it\nrains. A lot. Get a cycling\njacket. They are water-proof, can be scrunched\ninto the smallest pocket of\nany bag, and light enough\nso that you don\u2019t get super\nsweaty on your way to uni.\nGet a fluorescent one: they\n\u201cI don\u2019t want\nto be killed by\na driver who\nhates cyclists\nbecause you\ncouldn\u2019t stop\nfor a light to\nturn green \u201d\n\u201cFor those\nof you how\ndidn\u2019t already\nknow, it rains.\nA lot. Get a\nwaterproof\ncycling jacket.\u201d\nmake a huge difference\non how visible you are at\nnight. They are a tad pricey\n(\u00a360) but Proviz Reflect is\na really good jacket and it\nis kinda trendy.\n6. Lights\nOn the subject of being\nseen: please don\u2019t cheap\nout on lights. London is\nso well lit at night that\ncrummy lights just won\u2019t\nbe visible at night, at all.\nFor front lights, you should\nbe looking at something\nlike the Exposure Switch\nor the Cateye Volt 800. For\nbacklights, something like\nthe Exposure TraceR rear\nbike light or the Bontrager\nFlare R rear light are really\ngood options. The other\nlight I would seriously\nsuggest getting is a light\nfor your rucksack, the\niQualTech Backpack light\nis not a replacement for a\nproper backlight but is a\nreally cheap (\u00a310) way to\nhelp you be more visible\nat night.\n7. Learn to fix\nyour own bike\nYou\u2019ve managed to get\nyourself into university,\nyou can definitely learn\nhow to fix a bike. There\nare several bits of basic\nmaintenance you can\neasily teach yourself and\ncarry out with a basic bike\nmulti-tool, and the Global\nCycling Network has\nsome really good videos\nonline that take you step\nby step on how to fix pretty\nmuch any problem with\nyour bike. Alternatively,\nbefriend someone who\nknows how to fix bikes\u2026\n8. Don\u2019t be a dick\nCycling in London gets\na bad rep for being really\ndangerous, and part of\nthat is the attitude of some\ndrivers towards cyclists.\nThese drivers are, thank-fully, in the minority at\nthe moment but they seem\nto be growing. The big\ndriver of this anti-cyclist\nsentiment is that there is\nan unfortunate number\nof cyclists who have no\nregard for the rules of the\nroad. So: stop at red lights\nand zebra crossings; signal\nbefore you turn; don\u2019t\ncycle on pavements; when\navailable, use cycle paths;\nand please please please\ndon\u2019t go up the inside of\ncars or buses when lane\nsplitting. I don\u2019t want to\nbe killed by some driver\nwho hates cyclists because\nyou couldn\u2019t wait for a\nlight to go green.\n9. It\u2019s not all\ndoomandgloom\nIf you read the papers\nyou would be forgiven for\nthinking that if you cycle\nin London you will die.\nNow, I know it\u2019s a bit rich\ncoming from someone\nwho has been hit cycling,\nbut it really isn\u2019t that\ndangerous. There is loads\nof guidance online on how\nto cycle safely in London,\nlike The London Cyclist\nwebsite.\n10. Have fun\nCycling should be an\nenjoyable experience. It is\nsuch a good way to learn\nthe city and see parts of\nLondon that you would\nmiss on the tube.\nIf you like your road\ncycling then you can join\nICU Cycling Club and\nexplore some of the Surrey\nor Windsor countryside.\nThis guy clearly hasn\u2019t read our top tips... wear a helmet! // Flickr/Sascha Kohlmann\n\n"

I mean, there\u2019s\nnothing /wrong/ with it.\nThe band members are\nobjectively skilled musi-cians, who play clearly\nand effectively together.\nThere\u2019s a pleasant, per-vasive, oozing harmony\nthat takes talent to pull\noff through the whole\nruntime. Harp arpeggios\nare performed with a\nwonderful flourish, and\nthe bassline is marked by\ncrisp technicality. Where\nthe album leaves much to\nbe desired is the dreadful\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\ncomposition. No risks\nare taken over the band\u2019s\nearlier repetoire: compare\nthe wonderful syncopation\nof \u201cJoesph Carnell\u201d to /\nany/ of the plodding hat-hat-hat-snare recycled\nG\nY!BE has\nearned itself a\nseat in the post-rock pantheon,\nand for good reason. The\nMontreal collective, led\nby guitarist/composer\nEfrim Menuck, has a\nscore of classic post-rock albums. The band is\nmarked by a bleak, ragged,\ndistorted sound, always\naggressively limping to a\nheroic climax, which inevitably fades once more\ninto droning noise. The\nopening cut builds a dissonant wall of sound that\ngives way to a triumphant\nmarch, carrying us into\n\u201cBosses Hang,\u201d a suite\nthat rounds out the first\nhalf of the album. The\n15-minute section builds\nits way into a fantastically\ncathartic climax in Part\nIII. Then again, the drones\nyet wounded\nmood, with\nglimmers of upper\nregisters adding a\nwonderful texture\nof lightness to the\npiece. Tension\nbuilds with quickening pace; it\ndrops off, cutting\nto distorted slide\nguitar reprising the\nviolin line in all but\ntimbre. The reprise\nis gradually moved into\nlower and lower registers,\nuntil a quick resolution is\ndrowned out by discordant noise. Then emerges\na forceful build over a\nfurious triplet-pocked\nwaltz, which resolves\ninto a pulsed waltz, over\nwhich violins shriek and\nsoar. The album closes\nby juxtaposing slowing\nviolin lines with a reprise\nof the triplets, which fade\nto a fuzzy sigh, and then\nsilence. This is one of\ntheir most compellingly\nbeautiful pieces; the music\nreally does sound like\nan anthem for no state.\nSo, does the album\nmatch up to what is\nexpected of a post-rock\ngiant? Probably.

Neverwhere, in\nmy opinion, should be read\nby everyone who lives\nin London. Richard, the\nprotagonist, moves south\nfrom Scotland to work in\nthe city, but by a stroke\nof fate entangles himself\nwith London Below, an\nalternative London where\nthe night is dangerous on\nKnightsbridge and monks\nclad in black roam through\nBlackfriars. The monthly\n\u2018floating market\u2019, where\nthe myriad characters of\nLondon Below sell and\nexchange their wares and\nservices, was held on the\nHMS Belfast.\nLondon Below is\ninhabited by talking rats,\nassassins and bodyguards\nfor hire, and a girl called\nDoor that Richard saves,\nwho can, well, open doors\nto the remotest of places.\nThe jealous villain is the\nmajestic Angel called\nIslington.\nAt first glance, one\nmight think that this is a\ncheesy fantasy story that\ntakes tube stations literally\nand makes a story out of\npuns. In fact, Gaiman\u2019s\ngenius is in distilling the\nheart of London from\nlighthearted references.\nAfter three years in\nLondon, Richard observes\nthat the city is \u2018filled with\ncolour\u2019.\n\u2018It was a city in which\nthe very old and the awkwardly new jostled each\nother, not uncomfortably,\nbut without respect...a city\nof hundreds of districts\nwith strange names -Crouch End, Chalk Farm,\nEarl\u2019s Court, Marble\nArch - and oddly distinct\nidentities.\u2019\nLondon Below is\nsimply the essence of this\nincredible juxtaposition\nand diversity blown up\nin a fantastical setting.\nBut, as Richard observes\nafter he chooses to return\nto London Above, which\nworld is, in fact, reality?\nThe monotony of his life\nin London Above, the\none with work worries,\nrelationship troubles\nand the eternal struggle\nto hail a black cab after\nmidnight, stood out more\nstrongly than ever after\nhis adventures in London\nBelow. As he passes by an\nelderly homeless lady on\nthe street, he tells her:\n\u2018I thought I wanted a\nnice normal life. I mean,\nmaybe I am crazy. I mean,\nmaybe. But if this is all\nthere is, then I don\u2019t want\nto be sane. You know?\u2019\nIndeed, for the reader,\nNeverwhere is an adventure that one does not come\nback from unchanged and\nunmoved. For one, every\nstop on the tube map now\nholds a special signifi-cance. As I pass through\nEarl\u2019s Court, I cannot help\nbut think of the scene of\nRichard meeting the Earl\nin his tube \u2018palace\u2019 at the\nstation, or the shepherds\nof Shepherd\u2019s Bush.\nThere is magic in seeing\nstories beneath everyday\nplaces and people, that\nextra sparkle that keeps us\nconnected and wondrous\nof our surroundings.\nLondon\u2019s diversity, its\namalgamation of the old\nand new, is fertile ground\nfor imagination. To the\nfreshers, take your time to\nexplore this vibrant city,\nand may you be touched\nby the magic around you.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to give\nNeverwhere a go.\nNeverwhere draws from the magic of London and puts it all in one place.\n\u2018He had gone beyond the world of metaphor & simile into the place of things that are, and it was changing him.\u2018\n// Benjamin Aw\n\u2018Is there anything, really, to be scared of?\u2019\n\u2018Only the night on the bridge,\u2019she said.\n// Benjamin Aw\n\n"

This sees\nthe College rise one place\nafter overtaking Durham.\nAn analysis published\nby Imperial cites improvements in teaching quality\nand student experience as\nthe main reasons for its\nrise in the rankings. Out\nof the 129 universities and\nhigher education institutes\nincluded in the rankings,\nImperial is 104th for\nteaching (up from 124th\nlast year) and 31st for\nstudent experience (up\nfrom 77th in 2017). Following last year\u2019s results,\nprovost Professor James\nStirling promised to\naddress issues surrounding\nfeedback and assessments.\nVice-provost (education)\nand inclusive teaching.\nOur new Learning and\nTeaching Strategy gives us\na clear framework to build\non our existing strengths\nand drive the changes\nthat our students want and\nneed.\nOf the 14 subject tables\nImperial appears in, it is\nin the top three for nine.\nThis is a slight decrease\non last year. Ranks have\nimproved in six subjects\nand fallen in four. Changes\nhere are again a result\nof teaching and student\nexperience, boosting the\nscore for physics but\ncausing a drop for mathematics and chemistry. It\nis worth noting that these\nmeasures are relevant to\nother universities. This\nmeans Imperial fell in\nthe medicine rankings as\nEdinburgh and Swansea\nmade improvements. The\nremaining subjects have\nmaintained their positions\nfrom last year, including\ncivil engineering and\ngeology, for which Imperial is top of the tables.\nThe College\u2019s analysis\nstates that while being\ngenerally outranked by\nOxford and Cambridge,\nImperial is still ahead of\nUCL in both national and\nsubject rankings.\nThe results also indicate\nthat standards at Imperial\nare higher this year. The\nrequired 222 UCAS\npoints places Imperial\nbetween Cambridge (230\npoints) and Oxford (221\npoints). Although Imperial\nmakes more offers than\nOxford and Cambridge,\ncompetition is arguably\nfiercer here.

Or maybe\nyou just need somewhere\nto go with your new\nfriends without becoming\nfinancially crippled. Been\nthere, done that.\nWe\u2019re university\nstudents, which means\nthat most of us are perpetually broke. Here are\nsome of the places your\nwell-seasoned seniors\nvisited during times of\nhardship, torture, and self-doubt during their time at\nImperial.\nMy Old Dutch\nPancakes are the answer\nto everything! Well, not\neverything, but most\nthings.This pancake house\non Kensington Church\nStreet prides itself on\nserving gigantic pancakes,\nboth savoury and sweet.\nOne pancake usually costs\n\u00a38 to \u00a312 and the portion\nis generous. What\u2019s better:\nevery Monday, excluding\nspecified items on the\nmenu, all sweet and\nsavoury pancakes will cost\n\u00a35.95.

The most\nstudent-popular order\nwill be their lunch menu,\nwith a variety of mains to\nchoose from, ranging from\nbento to sushi set. Each\nset costs \u00a37.90 and comes\nwith a cup of warm green\ntea. Note that there will be\na service charge and the\nqueue can be quite long\nduring lunchtime.

The\nshop owner is rumoured\nto be a Malaysian so it\u2019s\nnot surprising to see some\nSoutheast Asian dishes on\nthe menu. The best part\nabout this shop is that the\nprices are generally \u00a36 or\nless, saving you from the\ndilemma of going broke or\nstarving.\nBosphorus\nKebab\nWith online reviews\nsinging praises and friends\nswearing by it, it seems\nlike this Turkish shop on\nGloucester Road is the\nplace to go when you yearn\nfor something exotic. The\nprices range from \u00a36 to \u00a38\nand it is well-portioned,\nits doner kebab being the\nmost popular order. The\ndownside is that there\nare not many seats in this\nsmall shop so it can be\ncrowded at times. Takeaways are recommended.\nWasabi\nWasabi sells a variety\nof ready-to-eat Japanese\nfood outside South Kensington station, be it hot\nfood, sushi rolls or soups.\nWith bento prices from\n\u00a35 to \u00a310, this place is\nfrequented by students\nwho want a quick lunch.\nRecommended mains\ninclude chicken katsu\ncurry bento and chicken\nteriyaki bento.

Equally, you\ndo not want to be remembered for attempting to\ncook an overly ambitious\nthree course meal in the\nearly hours of the morning.\nYour new hall mates will\nnot thank you for setting\noff the fire alarm, forcing\nthem to trudge down 19\nflights of stairs (if you\nlive on the top floor of\nthe Woodward buildings)\nin their pyjamas and flip\nflops. Trust me \u2013 it\u2019s not\nthe way to make friends.\nThe trick is to find a balance between good tasting\nfoods that your stomach\nwill thank you for, and\nsimplicity that your tired\nalcohol-muddled brain\ncan deal with. Thankfully,\nI\u2019m here to give you a few\nideas.\nThe Old Classic:\nCheese and Crackers\nI\u2019m personally an\nadvocate for cheese and\ncrackers.

Enjoy\nit with no fear of judgement in the empty kitchen.\nLike cheese out of a can?\nUgh, but ok, go ahead,\nthis is your time to avoid\njudgment. If you happen\nin that! If not, try adding\npesto if you have some in\nthe cupboard. Nostalgic\nfor the days of Dairylea\nLunchables? Cut up and\nadd some ham to your\ncheese and crackers.\nInstant Carb Gratification\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the pot\nnoodle, I would encourage\nyou to diversify your\nrange of instant carbs, as\nyou\u2019ll soon get sick of\nthem (or perhaps not, I\nknow people who swear\nby them). Try different\nflavours of microwaveable\nrice or even couscous. Of\ncourse, rice is easy peasy\nto make in a rice cooker\nor on the stove, but I think\ncheating with a microwave and avoiding boiling\nhot water is probably the\nsafer (and definitely the\nquicker) alternative after a\nlong night.\nA Toasty End to the\nNight\nFancy a sandwich but\nwant something warming\nafteranightoutinLondon?\nThe obvious choice\nhere is a toasty. Here\u2019s a\nthought: pre-make it and\nstick it in a reusable (let\u2019s\nbe eco-friendly, this is\nImperial after all) toaster\nbag. You can buy these for\na few pounds in big supermarkets and being able to\nstick your toasties straight\ninto the toaster and avoid\nwaiting for your oven grill\nto preheat is a huge time\nsaver. Too lazy to make\na toasted sandwich? Well\nok, then I guess toast is on\nthe menu. If you\u2019re new to\nBritain then I encourage\nyou to try marmite. You\nwill soon learn that this\ncontroversial savoury\nspread divides the nation\nin half into lovers and\nhaters. Spread a very thin\nlayer over margarine/\nbutter \u2013 yum (you can\nguess which half I fall\ninto).\nDIY Takeaways\nSave some money and\nmake your own takeaway\nalternative. Buy some\noven chips, sprinkle\nsome cheese on top (buy\npre-grated for maximum\nlaziness), and stick it in the\noven on a baking tray. You\ncould also easily make\ngravy by stirring gravy\ngranules into hot water\nand pouring this over the\ntop of your cooked chips\nto make the northern\nEnglish delicacy of cheesy\nchips and gravy.\n\u00a7\nOf course preparing\nyour own drunk food will\ntake a bit more time and\nrequire a bit more effort\nthan purchasing from\nyour fast food outlet of\nchoice. But where would\nyou rather wait for your\nfood? In your lovely warm\nkitchen, close to the warm\nembrace of your own bed,\nor in a long queue somewhere in the West End,\nCamden, or Elephant and\nCastle? I know what I\u2019d\nchoose.\nInstant noodles might be a student\u2019s best friend, but ensure you diversify your carb choices \u2013 why not branch out to couscous?! // Flickr/elsie.hui\nto have some hummus,\nguacamole, salsa, tzatziki,\nor whatever your dip of\nchoice is in the fridge, then\nperfect, dip some crackers\n\n"

If you crave traditional Asian food, like\ndim sum or bubble tea, or want to enjoy the views of\nChinese-style gates and lanterns, this is the place for you! It\u2019s also\nthe most popular destination for Chinese New Year celebrations in\nthe spring.\nMoreover, Chinatown is just next door to Leicester Square, which\nis surrounded by cinemas, English pubs, and restaurants. You can\nalso find an enormous M&M\u2019s World shop there,\ncontaining more chocolate in one place than you\ncould ever imagine. Beware though \u2013 it\u2019s full\nof screaming kids at any given time, but is\nstill an interesting place to see if you have\na sweet tooth.\nMinutes away from Leicester Square\nis Piccadilly Circus, with the famous\nstatue of Eros; and Regent Street, one\nof the biggest shopping destinations\nin London. The best way to reach these\nspots is to take the tube to Leicester Square\nstation and just walk around the area. Enjoy\nthe views!\nS\ntarting at universi-ty, especially one\nas highly demanding as Imperial,\ncan be both exciting and\noverwhelming. Most\nstudents often find themselves swamped with work\nfrom the second week\nof term, but it\u2019s always\nworth remembering that\nby studying here you also\nlive in one of the greatest\nand most well-known\ncities in the world.And the\nbest thing about London is\nthat it has so much more to\noffer besides the famous\ntourist spots, such as Big\nBen or London Eye. So\nhere\u2019s a short guide to\nexploring London, which\nincludes less touristy\nplaces, well worth a visit.\nMost of them are free \u2013 a\nhuge win in London as\nyou\u2019ll soon realise \u2013 and\ncan be used as nice study\nbreak destinations. So let\u2019s\nput our walking shoes on\nand explore this beautiful\ncity!\nCovent Garden\nJ\nust within a walking distance of Leicester\nSquare you\u2019ll find Covent Garden. Its main\nattraction is the indoor market, with cute \u2013\nalbeit quite pricey \u2013 restaurants and shops.\nJust outside the market is the Royal Opera House,\nand the surrounding areas are always full of street\nperformers. One of the coolest things around is\nMaxwell\u2019s Bar & Grill restaurant, just opposite the\nCovent Garden tube station. This place sells amazing\nfreakshakes \u2013 super delicious milkshakes with cakes,\nmarshmallows, and ice-cream on top \u2013 that are not\nto be missed. So take your SO, friends, or even just\nyourself out on a freakshake date for a well-deserved\nsugar boost after a long and tiring week!\nTRAVEL\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nLittle Venice\nT\nhis little gem, hidden in the heart of\nPaddington, is a perfect place for romantic\nwalks with that special someone, or even\njust by yourself. It\u2019s a smaller and much\ncheaper version of the actual Venice in Italy:\nbasically a collection of beautiful canals,\nfull of colourful boats. Some of them\nare used as cafes, where you can get an\naffordable deal on cream tea, something you have to try at least once\nwhile visiting the UK. The best way\nof getting around is taking the tube\nto Warwick Avenue station, which is\njust within walking distance of Little\nVenice. Walking alongside the canals\nwill eventually lead you to Paddington\nstation, where you can depart home, or on to\nyour next destination.\nShoreditch\nO\nwing to its artsy and hipsterish vibe,\nShoreditch has become a popular\ndestination for young people, particularly famous for its vibrant nightlife.\nHowever, besides many cool clubs and bars,\nyou\u2019ll also find amazing graffiti almost\non every corner. So whether you\u2019re a\nhopeless party animal or have an eye\nfor street art, this is a place for you!\nIn addition, walking further east from\nLiverpool Street tube station will lead\nyou to Brick Lane, where huge street\nand indoor markets take place every\nSunday. You\u2019ll have a chance to try street\nfood from all over the globe, find interesting clothes and collectables, and enjoy\ntalented street performers. You can even walk\nall the way to the Flower Market on Columbia Road\nif you fancy some plants for your new room.\nLondon\u2019s Parks\nO\nne of the coolest things about London is that among all the\ngrand buildings and busy streets you can also find many\nparks, perfect for jogging, cycling, or having a picnic with\nfriends to maintain that study-leisure balance. Most Imperial\nstudents opt for Hyde Park, conveniently located minutes away from\nSouth Kensington campus, where even a short walk can be a nice break\nfrom the library. Another option is Holland Park, where you\u2019ll find the\nJapanese Kyoto Garden with colourful flowers, peacocks, waterfalls,\nand fish ponds. If you fancy spending more time outdoors, it\u2019s worth\npaying a visit to Regent\u2019s Park, home of beautiful gardens, fountains,\nstatues, and diverse wildlife. Situated on the northern side of the park\nis Primrose Hill, offering an amazing view of London\u2019s skyline, which\nmakes it a popular destination among picnickers.\n\n"

But exper-Neutrino experiment strikes gold\nPhysicists & politicians\nare both hoping for\na goldrush at South\nDakota\u2019s Homestake\nmine.\nThe language of science\nW\nhat is sci-ence? Well,\nthat\u2019s easy:\nscience is\nthe way that we uncover\nthe truths of the world, it\nis universal, it is objective.\nWell if you think that,\nyou are mistaken. We\nare taught that the best\nscience happens when we\nremove our \u2018humanness\u2019\nfrom the equation. But\ncan we subtract ourselves\nfrom science, removing all\nthose messy emotions?\nThe first problem is that\nscience is done by humans.\nWe make mistakes, we\nform social groups and,\nas much as we may hate\nto admit it, we sometimes favour our own pet\nhypotheses over others.\nWorst of all, according to\n17th century polymath,\nSir Francis Bacon, we talk\nto each other about our\nwork using language and\nthe language we use can\nimpact our research.\nRutherford\u2019s model\nof the atom, the idea of a\n\u2018genetic code\u2019, and even\nmessenger RNA (mRNA)\ncame from a hypothetical,\nmetaphorical origin.\nThough many scientists\nconsider themselves above\n\u2018ornamental\u2019 language,\nmetaphors and analogies\nare a huge part of science.\nRichard Dawkins\u2019\npointed out in The\nSelfish Gene, the use of\nmetaphor in science can\nalso generate \u201ca new way\nof seeing\u201d, which can in\nits own right make an\noriginal contribution to\nscience. How we conceive\nof a scientific entity or\nphenomenon, like an atom\nor a gene, and the potential properties we then\nconsider it to have affects\nthe direction of research.\nBy inherently concep-tualising the brain \u2018as a\ncomputer\u2019for instance, we\nmay begin to talk about its\n\u2018processing power\u2019, how\nit is \u2018wired\u2019 and start to\nperceive it as more like a\nmachine. This affects how\nwe conduct our research,\ndrawing us to pursue\nthis dominant school of\nthought and move away\nfrom features that may not\nfit. In turn we may start to\nascribe properties of our\nbrain, e.g. intelligence\nand consciousness, onto\nmachines.\nThe \u2018wood-wide web\u2019\nis an emerging metaphor\nexplaining how trees\nin forests can be linked\ntogether via a network of\nfungi, like how humans\nare connected by the\nworld-wide web. Plants\nhave evolved mutualistic\nrelationships with fungal\npartners, which give them\nnitrogen in exchange for\nphotosynthetic carbon.\nTrees that share the same\nfungal partners can therefore be linked physically\nunderground. In 1997 Dr\nSuzanne Simard was the\nfirst to show that Douglas-fir and Paper-birch\nsaplings were using this\nunderground network to\ntransfer carbon, alternating who sent more given\nthe season. The conclusion Simard came to,\nthat this was an example\nof trees evolving to help\nunrelated tree species,\nwas highly controversial.\nTwenty years on, and\nSimard has become the\nforest ecology equivalent\nof Brian Cox. Her craftsmanship and popularization of the \u2018wood-wide\nweb\u2019 metaphor arguably\npersuades us to conceive\nof trees as inherently\nsocial beings in a way\nthat supports her interpretation of the difficult to\ndecipher data. She even\ngoes further, suggesting\nthat forests are \u2018superorganisms\u2019 like ant colonies\nor bee hives, behaving in\na way that \u201cmight remind\nyou of a sort of intelligence,\u201d. Her popular work\nweaves a web of insightful\nmetaphors and analogies\nwhich leave you feeling \u2018at\niments in the late 1990s\nshowed that neutrinos\nchange type as they travel,\nimplying that they have a\nsmall but non-zero mass.\nThis non-zero mass and\ntheir ability to change type\ncould allow differences\nbetween their matter and\nantimatter interactions.\nStudying these differences\ncould explain why the\nuniverse is made of matter\nand not antimatter.\nFermilab\u2019s LBNF will\nbe the world\u2019s most intense\nhigh-energy neutrino\nbeam.
