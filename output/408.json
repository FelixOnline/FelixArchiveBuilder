    "content": "mix Cross Country\nExcuses, excuses...\nAT THEIR THIRD attempt\nthe Cross Country Club finally found, on the same\nday, both a race and some\npeople to run for them. This was for the third London\nColleges League race held\non Brunei' s course at Ruislip. Being represented by only\nfifteen people in all, IC's third team was incomplete with\nonly 3 runners; stars that\nthey are. Namely Colin Dale, Andy Davey and Mike Welford\nat 88,78 and 76 respectively, out of 9 7 . The club is desperately\nin need of more runners to fill these vacancies and so salvage the 3rd team who, despite\nvaliant efforts, are last in the\nfirst division. The second\nteam, however, strengthened\nits position at about 7'th with\nRoman Halenko leading them in\nat 30'th, having found his\nfell-running style well suited\nto the hilly terrain. Tony\nWeir found his strength (or was\nit speed?) could not compare\nwith Roman's over this short\n(long?) distance and he\nfinished32' nd. At 35'th, 48'th\nand 56'th were Dave Jones, Rich Harrington and Ian\nIsherwood completing the\nscoring with Alan Leakey as space r. The first team utterly\nfailed to repeat its last\nperformance of finishing 5 in\nthe first 15: instead it had\nto wait until 19'th place to\ncomplete scoring. Rob All in son once again led the team in,\nthough not feeling too pleased\nwith his position of 3 ' rd. Steve\nWebb slotted himself into\n6'th place and insisted on\ntelling everyone that he'd had\nan easy run. Dave Rosen and\nPaul Clarke finished well up\nin 12'th and 16'th places but\nfailed to say anything worth\nreporting. A If Garnett was space r for the first team at\n24'th and the culprit at 19'th\nwas Ian Ellis, for whom\nSpecial Mention is reserved\n(as always). On a pre-race\nwarm-up/cou c se see he was tripped by an unrecognised\nconstraint and had his basis reduced painfully to that of\nsprawling on the ground: this\nmay have affected the feasibility\nof a better performance. In\ncase you don't believe this,\nhe has produced an alternative\nexcuse( besides lack of\ntraining), claiming that he\nreceived the pointed elbow of\nlanky Rob All in son in his ribs on the crowded ten-foot-wide path which was used for\nthe start of this race. Despite\nthis drop in performance it\nlooks as if the first team will retain first place in Div1 by\nan increased margin of several\nhundred points.\nThe following Saturday,\nthree of the club travelled to\nBrighton for the South of\nThames Champs d is quis ed as\nrunners for the Hercules Wimbledon, Walton and South\nLondon teams. Steve (this\nis a real race) Webb was 102'nd,\nfollowed by Ian (anything for a pub-crawl) Ellis at 132'nd\nand Dave (no comment) Jones at 174'th out of 220. The real\npurpose of this trip was a visit to a nearby Young' s Pub\nand this was finally reached\nby a circuitous route following\nan incorrect decision by the\nNavigating Committee. Meanw hi le, Dave Rosen was running\nin the North of Thames Champs\nand the rest of the club were\nmaking good use of the training\nfacilities provided around\nWimbledon Common.\nFootball\nDefence sees IC through\nKings College 1st XI 0 Imperial College 1st XI 1\nIC's FIRST S began this\nterm's league fixtures with\nthis fine away win over Kings. Playing against a strong\nwind in the first half IC were\npinned back in defence. However, the team\" fought hard and\ncovered well restricting Kings to few goal scoring chances. Even when Kings did get\nthrough they found goalkeeper\nKev Allen in good form.Towards\nthe end of the half, IC counterattacked well with Terry\nLindon making some blinding\nruns down the right wing. IC\nwere therefore relieved to hear\nthe half-time whistle with the\nscore sti II at 0\u20140.\nThe second half was a far\nmore evenly contested affair\nwith IC failing to make real\nuse of the wind advantage.\nNevertheless they clinched the game with the only goal of\nthe game following a quick\ncounter attack. A King's forward shot against the\npost, the ball was cleared, Terry Grimwade moved it on\nto Steve Gee who broke clear\nand lobbed the ball over the\nadvancing keeper's head and\ninto the net. Soon afterwards\nan excellent save by the\nKing's goalkeeper prevented\nIC from going further ahead.\nHowever, due to a splendid\nteam effort, IC held on to\nwin. Steve Bates deserves\nspecial mention for an\noutstanding display in the\nheart of the defence, and for\nhi since sant chanting of\n\" E iVe evo\" which has been\nan inspiration to the team\nthroughout the season. Team:- K Allen, C Howell,\nJ l ley,S Bates, C Dooley,\nG Roberts, T Grimwade, P Singleton, T Lindon, D Rudd,\nS Gee.\nHockey\nIndifference doesn't pay\nIndian Gym 3 Imperial College ' A' XI 2\nC STARTED this match\nrather i nd i ffe rent ly. Consequent ly\nIndian Gym got on top from the\nstart, taking most of the ball\nn midfield and creating\nmany chances. In a ten minute\nspell mid-way through the\nfirst half they scored three\ngoals, two of which were\nobviously illegal. However\nthis is the penalty a team\npays if for various reasons\nthey can provide no umpire.\nHowever at this point IC\nwoke up and began putting\npressure on the Indian Gym\ngoal, resulting in some good\nsaves from their keeper.\nWith Harry Magnay providing\nthe forwards with some excellent passes, the pressure paid off\nwhen Bob Middleton scored\nfrom close in at the end of\nthe half.\nAfter the break, IC kept\nup the pressure and were\nunlucky not to score almost\nA game of tricks\nTime: 2.30; Wednesday; Place: Harlington Characters: IC Ladies team (or most of them) and\nfive opposition (reputed to\nbelong to UC). Obviously with\na2 \u20141. majority of players IC\ncould not but thrash their\nopponents. So UC frightened\nby this prospect, conceded\nthe match (to give us two\npoints in the league), borrowed\nsome of our players and played\nin a friendly' manner. However,\nafter de moral ising us by\nscoring umpteen goals in the\nfirst 5 minutes they sprang\ntheir next trick by producing\nsix more players (who had\nfound some difficulty in\nlocating the ground). So\nthey took back the two points\nand we began again. This straight away when a certain\nleft winger missed again\n(not quite as bad as Charing Cross, but Close). However good play by IC's 'adopted'\nright winger and Mike Isles led\nto Mike scoring IC's second\ngoal. At this point the game\nopened up and the play moved\nquickly from end to end, both\nteams coming close to scoring\nthe vital goal. However\nneither side added further to\nthe score sheet. The game\nended on a high note with\nJasper pursuing their inside\nright with murderous intent\nafter he had chopped down from\nbehind. This was a good\nperformance from the whole\nteam in the second half\nespecially Harry, Mike and Chris Team:- R Hutson, J Marshall,\nJ Cook, C Parker, H Magnay, K Houlden, AN Other, P Nowell,\nMr(& Mrs) Middleton, M Isles,\nC Parker.\ntime not so friendly, although\nthey still de-moral is ed us\nby scoring umpteen goals in\nthe first five minutes! However\nat half time we played a trick\non them by magically changing\nour goal keeper into a goal\nscoring forward. This time it\nwas our turn to be the dominating\nside, and it nearly worked. By\nthe end of the match we had\n3 goals to our credit which was very pleasing and marred\nonly by the fact that UC had 8! Oh well we nearly got\n2 points for our efforts.\nTeam: L McLardte, L Couchman,\nC Forsyth, F Delargy, R White,\nS Horn, J Hawson, D Mousey\n(Capt), J Dracott, E Hammersley.\nGoals: J Hawson; J Draoott (2).\nShort corner play lacking\nChalfout St Peter 5\nDEFENCES had a hard time\non this bumpy pitch where a hard hit pass could bounce\nalarmingly. So, as the score\nreflects, the attacks had\nmost of it their own way.\nChalfout, on their home ground,\nand obviously used to the\nconditions, found their rhythm\nquicker than IC, and went\ninto the lead. Bob Middleton\nlevelled the scores with a well\ntaken reverse-stick flick.\nThe play moved from end to\nend, mainly due to inability\nto cut out passes. IC took the\nlead from a penalty ' flick' by\nKim Houlden, but Chalfout\nquickly came back, and .went\n5\u20142 up. IC recovered from the\nImperial College 1st XI 3\nshock, and although they had\nthe best of the game from then\non, only one goal came \u2014 Bob Middleton scoring again after\ngood play by Sig Golding. As throughout the season,\nthe main IC failing was poor\nplay at short corners. If\nthis is improved, there is no\nreason why disappointing\nresults shouldn't be left\nbehind, especially considering\nthe good performances by\nAlan Brown, Bob Middleton,\nand Sig Golding. Team:- R Hutson, J Marshall,\nJ Cook, J Andrews, A Brown,\nKHoulden, SGolding, R Fatania,\nB Middleton, A Ross, C Hardy.\n\n"

This match proved to be just what\nthe doctor ordered.\nOnce again IC trooped off\nto darkest Orpington, a couple\nof players short, but in good\nspirits as they had beaten\nLee about two months before,\nagain with a deficit of players.\nImagine IC's delight when,\non taking to the field of play,\nLee proved to have one player\nless. The match itself was really\nquite enjoyable, as IC for\nonce did not have an uphill\nbattle. Most of the play was in\nLee's half, which proved a mite boring for IC's defence,\nand led to them making many\nruns into the attack. It was\ngood to see the forwards\nbuilding up their attacks rather\nthan running straight at goal. Derek Senner and Martin\nSmeaton set up some very\ngood moves and, if not for\ngood goal keeping, would have\nscored more often than they,\ndid. Dennis Kehoe, who was\nplaying his first match, did\nextremely well, drawing his\ndefence man out from in front\nof goal, and once getting on\nthe score sheet. Richard\nForster, while playing only\nhis second game, showed\nthat he could develop into a very useful and powerful\nplayer, scoring four times.\nCrosby' s equivalent of the\nthing from the pit did his\nusual stuff and scored and\nscored, greedy bustard. Paul\nJepson and Bill Jackson in\ndefence, did allot of running\nabout and quickly terminated\nmost of Lee's attacks. Mean-while the goalkeeper and\ncaptain, whose name I forget,\nlet in three goals. We ought to have matches\nlike this more often.\nTeam:- Bob Strangeway (Capt),\nBill Jackson, Paul Jepson,\nQuasimodo; Derek Senner,\nRichard Forster, Dennis\nKehoe, Martin Smeaton.\nTable tennis\nThrilling ending as IC find form\n100% record for Ho\nImperial College 1st4 BSC5 Imperial College1 st8 Zoo1 LAST WEEK the 1st team\ncompleted the first half of their\nleague programme with an\naway game at BSC and a home\ngame against the Zoo. Last term we had gone to\nBSC and beaten them 5 - 4\nin the cup in a very tough\ngame. This time however, they\nhad a much better third player\nin their team, and were out for\nrevenge. KaWei was in very\ngood form and won all his\nthree games, but Colin and. I couldn't keep up the standard,\nand after eight sets the score\nwas four all. In the final set\ntheir number one player beat\nColin in three games to\nclinch the match.\nThe match against the Zoo\nwas very- different. On our\nhome ground and smarting from\ndefeat the previous evening we\nswept to a7 \u20140 lead before\nthe Zoo managed to win an\nenthralling eighth set which\ncontained 5 nance s. The win against the Zoo left us in second place in\nthe league at the half way\nstage having lost 2 games;\none to top. place Harrow Road\npolice (unbeaten as yet) and\nthe other to fourth place BSc. Congratulations to William\nHo who leads the divisional averages with 1QO% record. The seconds still have one game\nto play to reach the halfway\npoint in their league. If they\nwin this match they will move\ninto third place which is a very good achievement considering they lost their first three\nleague matches.\nCongratulations also to\nYee Min Yi u who beat Vladimir\nPozdniakov in the final of\nthe open knockout at the end\nof last term.

When\neventually our line was\ncrossed 't was due to, as in the\nfollowing, 'our tires, missed\ntackling, 'h moves leading up to\nthe score. Our problem was\ngreatest in not being able to\nprovide the backs with good\nball from the set scrum even\nthough Tony Fitzgerald was\nhooking. The Osterley grey\nhaired front row split ours\napart leaving nothing for\nus to push against. By, the\nend of the first half we had\nstarted to match Osterley but\nno more.\nHowever, the second half, saw a complete turnabout\nwith the A's putting a lot of\npressure on, as the front\neight worked more as a unit.\nThis work rate eventually\nbrought its rewards and a good handling move, from\na loose maul, by forwards and\nbacks, squeezed Bob Leeson into the comer. After that the\npressure dropped allowing\nOsterley to Improve on their\nlead. Even though we matched\nthem, they were handed points\nby being allowed to run and\nthrow the ball around.\nThe result was disappointing\nas the team worked hard and\nearnestly, but hopefully we\nhave benefitted from this\nmatch.\nThanks must go to Ian\nMcLean for his excellent\nrefereeing and to all players\nfor turning up on time.\nTeam:- R Pullen, A Gregory,\nC Becque, R Leeson, S Kegs,\nJ Thomas, G Sweatman, R Oyler, T Fitzgerald, S Downing,\nR Porter, C Cuthbertson,\nN Wiltshire, R Jenner, S Braurid.\nOrienteering\nRecords smashed\nSMASHING ALL previous\nrecords, the Orienteering Club descended upon Great Wood,\nPotters Bar in un dreamt of\nnumbers \u2014 fifteen!

The main\nfault with both ladies is in their choice\nof material.

Firstly, FELIX has not witnessed\nscenes of hysterical rejoicing\nfrom the ICWA front since the\nintroduction of the Equal Rights Act for one simple\nreason. Women have not only\nknown themselves to be\nequal to their male counterparts\nfor some considerable time,\nthey have consistently proved\nthemselves to be so. The fact that the law has only\njust come to realise this is\nmore an embarrassment to it\nthan a cause for congratulations.\nTrue, it is a long awaited\nmilestone in the campaign\nfor equal rights for women,\nbut, whereas laws can be\nchanged with relative ease, it takes a far more conscious effort to erase the centuries'\nlong conditioning which still pervades much of our society. Secondly, where, we ask\nourselves are \" the hoards of\nyoung men valiantly knocking\non IC WA's door\". Men, far from\nbeing excluded from the\nactivities that ICWA organises, have always been keenly\nwelcomed.\nThe article' then goes on to\ntritely sum up ICWA as if it\nwere on Ents sub-committee,\na\" social off shoot of ICU\". Perhaps a complete list of\nICWA activities would help\nshow that this is not the\ncase. In addition to those\nstated in the article, ICWA\nhas organised a Flat share scheme operated prior to the\nautumn term and for which\nICWA was formally thanked by\n;\nICU Council; debates have\nbeen held; a weekly discussion group is run; informative\ntalks have been given by guest\nspeakers and aPG and Overseas Students evening has been\norganised. For this term more\ntalks have been arranged as\nhas a. very comprehensive\nwomen's studies course.\nAs to the IC Executive or\nthe Carnival Committee(?)\norganising these events, I would imagine that they would\nreply that they had quite\nenough to do already. This was the reason for setting\nup the ICWA committee in the\nfirst place and this is true of\nall Union committees.\nSome ICWA members have\nalso visited their old schools to give talks to sixth form\ngirls in the hope of encouraging\nthem to study here. *\nICWA, ' a perpetual monument\nto the IC sex ratio' \u2014 I counter\nby asking 'Is any other group\nwithin the Union doing more\nto relieve the problem?/\nThat some of our members\ndo not wish to belong to ICWA\nis no maxim for disbanding\nICWA; if this were so we\nwould have to start questioning\nthe continued existence of\nnot only the CC Us. as well as\nICWA. but indeed ICU itself.\nThat 'you can't please all the\npeople all the time' was\nrealised by a far more able\nPresident than I. Whilst I share this sentiment, I do\nnot wish to be shot for it!\nOne point I would like to\nmake clear is that whilst every\nmember of the Women in Action Group is a member of J CW A, the\nreverse is not true^ and in\nairing their views they are not\nspeaking for the whole of ICWA.\nFinally, it is one thing to\nsay to a Presidential candidate\nthat 'ICWA needs a kick in the\npants', it is another thing as\nPresident to do it. I would\nagree that it is entirely needed\nand go on to include not just\nICWA, but the whole of ICU. The appalling turnout at\nUnion General Meetings bears\nwitness to this. To conclude,\nsuggestions and new ideas for\nimproving ICWA are always\nwelcomed, please take advantage\nof this.\nYours sincerely, STELLA GODFREY, ICWA President.\nSir, \u2014 May I remind the authors\nof \" Titbits\"( FELIX No.407) that oh November 20th,1975 all male students at IC were\ngiven the opportunity of joining\nthe ICWA Committee as\n\" MrI CW A\"( a perfectly\nserious post, despite its\ntitle).\nThere were just three\ncandidates, one of whom was au ly elected. Therefore, by\nmy calculations,( admittedly\nonly those of a mathematician),\ntrie \" hoards of young men\nvaliantly knocking on IC WA's do pr\" consist of precisely\ntwo* persons.\nHaving made this trivial\npoint, I would like to say how\nstimulating I found the rest of\nthe article and I look forward\nto hearing other reactions to it.\nYours faithfully\nAC PRESTON Maths 1\nNUS - do you care?\nSir, \u2014 It is strange that the\nlast national conference of\nNUS could- be attacked in\nFELIX for not being directly\nrelevant to students on one\npage and then having quite\na good report of all the many\nissues discussed in the\ncentre pages.\nUsing the \"not relevant to\nstudents\" argument the\ndiscussion is now turning to\nwhether or not we need an\nNUS. The issue of needing\ntravel, welfare, entertainments\nand other social ' aci li ties on\na national level has already\nbeen adequately dealt with by\nothers. The main need, however\nis for an organisation to\nrepresent our needs and\nviews at a national level. If there is nothing that you\nwant to change, if you don't want higher grants, if you\ndon't mind educational cutbacks,\nif you don't care about the\neconomic situation in Britain\nand if you don't care what\nhappens in any other part of\nthe world then you may as\nwell leave NUS. If you want\nto change anything at all, though, you must see the need\nfor a student organisation. It\nwould be impossible to even\ndecide on the grants claim, let alone run a campaign in\nsupport of it without some\nsort of national coordination.\nIn fact we would be opting\nout in the worst possible way\nif we admit that on one hand\nstudents need a national\norganisation and on the other\nto say we are not prepared to\nmake our contribution towards\nit.\nIt has been claimed by\nmembers of IC Union that a lack of democracy (which has\nlead to a Broad Left \" clique\") has invalidated the present\nnational union. And yet what\npolicies are these self styled\nreformers and protectors of\ndemocracy putting forward?\nTheir main argument seems to\nbe - \" most students are\napathetic\" (ie a lot of IC\nstudents are apathetic) which\nproves that if a national\nunion exists it ought to be\napathetic too. If it is no\nstudent policies you want then\nI would say leave NUS \u2014 but\nI don't believe anyone would\nwant complete student apathy.\nIf you do want student ideas\nput forward you must protect\nNUS as an active union. The\nprinciple of electing a national\nexecutive at a national\nconference is central to\nactive democracy \u2014 we must\nhave an executive that is\nresponsible to a body that\ncan mandate it and ensure\nthat it follows the policy\ndecided. If it is the policies of\nNUS you disagree with, it is\nboth the policies and.leadership\nthat you must change through\nputting forward alternative\npolicies at a national conference. Of course you\ncould take the sour grapes\nattitude of Derrick Everett \u2014\nNUS won't follow our policies so we will leave it. But I say if you agree to the need\nfor a national union you must\nstick with it even when it\ndoesn't pass everything you in\nparticular agree with and hope\nto change it at some other\nconference.\nFinal iy, on international\npolicies. People say \u2014 why\nworry about Chile, Angola, or anywhere else, they do\nnot directly affect us. It is\nin the nature of students\nexistence however that they\nthink about issues, because\nthat is what education is all about (though on considering\nIC students I become less\nconvinced of this!) You cannot\nstop people from wanting to\nconsider and express views\nabout any issue they feel to\nbe important.\nIf you do not care about the\nrest of the world then perhaps\nit is about time you did. What\nhappened in Chile could happen\nhere, apartheid in South Africa has its foundation in racist\nideas that we have here int\nBritain. But even, if it could\nnever happen to you the fact\nthat fellow members\"of humanity\nare suffering in many parts of\nthe world needs every person\nto speak out , because\nwhatever you do not condemn\nyou are in some way condoning.\nYours sincerely, MARY ATTENBOROUGH, Maths Deo Rec Continued on page 8\nImperial College Ra'l way Society\nNarrow Gauge Railways Yesterday and Today\nby Rev ER BOSTON at 5.40pm in ME664 Tues 27th Jan Presidential Address:\nRailways \u2014 Then and Now\nby Mr OS NOCK at 5.40pm in Mech Eng664 Tue s3 rd Feb FELIX urgently requires\nwriters and reporters.\nAnyone interested in\njoining the staff should\ndrop into the FELIX office\nNOTICE Anyone willing to donate\nblood of any category please contact the technician in the\nHealth Centre any morning or\non Int. 4275.\n\n"

I have\nnever understood why any\nsane IC student would willingly risk his neck in the Dart\nwhen similar satisfaction is\nattainable with two feet\nsafely planted in deer dung\non Richmond Park. IC Model Aircraft Club has\nbeen able to purchase radio control equipment for which\nwe have built a glider. The craze has spread throughout\nthe club with the result that we now have four machines.\nThis has brought an unexpected\nbonus to the club. We can now\noffer a keep-fit session on\nSaturday mornings known as\" make like a tow line winch\". The club is traditionally\nstrong on control line combat\nflying. This has largely\ngiven way to radio and indoor\nRTP flying. Future projects\nin this field include, I hope, a spot of outdoor flying.( RTP for the uninitiated means\nround \u2014 not up \u2014 the pole.\nAnyone who has ever visited\nthe Model Engineer Exhibition will remember those things\nwhich flew in circles around\nones head. Our first outing this term\nwas in fact to the Model\nEngineer expo'. Here the\ncrowd were treated to the\nspectacle of several thrilling\ncrashes when one of our\nmembers ( em baras s ment forces him, me, to remain\nanonymous) attempted to\ncompete in the RTP competition.\nAfter demolition ing several\nmodels, I temporarily conceded\ndefeat and flew one of the\nexhibition models instead.\nClub meetings are held\nevery Thursday lunchtime in\nthe Southside lounge. Any stray aero mode ller s, defectors\nfrom Gliding Club and others\nExternal Eclairs\nI'M SORRY about this, but\nthis is going to be a serious\narticle for a change. I hope\nthis is not going to prevent\nthose few readers I still have\nfrom perse ve ring to the end ol\nmy contribution. Since some\npeople seem unable to distinguish\nbetween satire and sincere it yI shall try to be blunt and\nexplicit. Firstly, I hope you've all read the excellent articles in\nFELIX about the recent NUS conferences. I wonder, with\nthe Editor of FELIX, about\nthe \" relevance of such time-consuming motions\" and I agree that conferences have\nbecome a \"forum for political\ntheorists to express their\ngrandiose ideas\". This is\nnot because I disagree with\nthe politics of the NUS leadership, which I do, but\nbecause I disagree with the\npresence of sectarian politics; I do not think that students want\nto pay one pound per head per\nyear to sub sid is e an amalgam a tio of debating societies and to\nprovide political activists with\noffice facilities, expense\naccounts, etc. If anyone wants\nto take political action, then\nshe or he should damn well\npay for it and not expect the\nmoney to come from students\nwho have no interest in\npolitics. I am not against\npolitical activities in College, indeed I would encourage\nthe discussion of local or\ninternational issues within\npolitical societies and even\nat Union meetings, so long as\nthe students wish to discuss these issues. But as far as\nthe NUS is concerned, I wish they would devote their\nenergies to providing advice,\nservices and information to\nstudents and to their Unions. Therefore we should be doing\nsomething about it, even if as\nPete Teague says, we may\nhave to become, in a sense,\npolitical ourselves.\nThe question of setting\nup a travel service is rather\nacademic since the existing NUS services are available to\nnon-members, they need our\ntrade; especially at present!\nHowever, if NUS Travel should\never go to that great package\ntour centre in the sky, we\nmight have to think about\nsomething, admittedly rather\nmodest, to take its place. There is a successful and\nindependent travel centre at\nBradford and we could perhaps\nproduce something along\nthose lines in conjunction\nwith Brunei University.\nMy point about the voice\nof an independent IC was only\nslightly tongue-in-cheek. When\nIC was the only University\nColle geNUS it was not\nknown for the views of Imperial\nCollege Union to be quoted in th<\nHouse of Commons. (No\ndoubt the_ Co He ge archivist\ncan provide the references to\nHansard if anyone is interested).\nI'd be interested to hear how\noften the opinions of the\nNUS are quoted in Parliamentary\ndebates.\nI agreed entirely with Mrs\nGerrard that we should try to\nchange the policies of the\nNUS and also try to make the\nmost of their se vices. In\nfact I wish we could get our\nmoney's worth out of them. I'm sure John Downs would have\nbeen grateful for some information\non NUS Headquarters services from Mrs Gerrard a little\nearlier in the year. As far\nas I can tell, John has not\nused these services once this\nyear, but I'm sure he will do\nso if necessary. I believe that\nJohn will soon be producing\nan article on legal advice and\nlegal aid in conjunction with\nSue Kali c in ski and the Union\nsolicitor. The most useful\nservice provided by the NUS is probably the legal aid fund\nreferred to by Mr Barrett, which\nis available to help students\nwho have been refused legal\naid by the state. This is\nonly available if the NUS consider that the student has\na good case. As Mr Barrett well knows, I also believe that we should\nuse all means at our disposal to make the NUS more\nrepresentative of its Ordinary\nmembers, and he also knows\nthat I have been involved in\nmoves to institute a direct\nballot for the election of\nthe National Executive. I hope to pursue this at the\nnext conference.\nYou may not be aware that\nthe NUS Executive have a policy of encouraging the\ncentral representation of\ncollegiate Universities such\nas that of London. That is, ro discourage individual\ncolleges from sending\ndelegates to conference.\nThe latest step in this policy\nwas their decision not to\nallow the colleges of Oxford\nand Cambridge to use the new\nConference subsidy fund, which\nis designed to assist the\nUnions of small colleges who cannot afford to send\ndelegates to Conferences. I do not think it will be long\nbefore they refuse to accept\na delegation from Imperial\nCollege unless we do something\nabout it.\nDerrick (The Mole) Everett\nwill be welcomed with open\nhandcuffs.\nNick Green\nHistorical Re-enactment\nALL OVER Britain there are\ngroups ' of enthusiasts who\nregularly muster to re-fight\nbattles, sieges, campaigns and\nskirmishes of the English civil wars. This is done\npurely for enjoyment, so a great deal of relaxation\naccompanies mock-battling \u2014\ndrinking and singing being\namongst the foremost diversions engaged in.\nThis is by no means an all male activity, although to be\nauthentic, the role of women\nmust lie chiefly outside\nfighting.\nThese musters normally\ntake place over a weekend\nand occur most frequently\nduring the summer season\nwhen the weather suits camping.\nHowever, smaller, one-day\nevents occur throughout the\nyear. There are three major\nindependent, national societies; the Kings Army and the\nRoundhead Association( Army\nof Parliament who provide\ncompetition for each other,\nand the Sealed Knot Society\nLtd., which fights itself.\nPolitics, in all senses, tend\nto be unpopular, the cause being fairly academic. Everybody\nis there to enjoy themselves.\nAt the larger gatherings\nthe public is charge entry to\nwatch the battles. The money\nobtained helps to cover the\ncost of organising the battle,\nany profit going to a charity,\nnormally specified before the\nbattle. The Kings Army has an\nannual parade in Whitehall, to\ncommemorate the execution of\nCharles I.T his year it is\nbeing held on Sunday, 1st February, starting at about\n2.00pm. All are welcome to\nwatch, and if you want to\njoin in this or any other of\nthe societies activities, please contact S Shaw, Chem.\nEng. II.\nRefectory Complaints\nIN ALL REFECTORIES points arise which merit complaint. However, all to often customers are reluctant to air it\npublicly( for fear that nothing will be done?), and the\ncomplaint is not corrected. The Complaints SubCommittee is continuing the system by which complaints will be put right quickly, but its\neffectiveness depends upon the active support of refectory users. I feel that are state e tent of the system could be helpful. We div ida complaints into two classes:1. Direct complaints( particular meals, dirty cutlery etc.) Complaints should be made to the counter staff; if they\nare unhelpful ask for the Chef or the Supervisor. Enter the complaint in the Complaints Book even if it was rectified, stating what action( if any) was taken.2. General complaints and suggestions: Enter these in the' Complaints Book. Com pte in ts Books have been issued to all pay desks with, the instructions that they are to be available on\ndemand. If your demand is refused, see the Supervisor or\nthe Complaints Officer. These are: Union Building Steve Kim mins Physics3 S her field Building N ick Bray shaw R SMU Southside Gun j it Singh EE2E merging complaint patterns can then be seen quickly and corrective action taken. Good points are equally important. If you notice any that\nshould be adopted in other refectory areas, be as quick to\ntellus as you are to complain. It can all help to Improve\nthe service given. Finally, price lists are being put up before the counter service and at each pay desk. "

Mr Huck le field was a late replacement for Mr Eric Moonman who was originally\ninvited by the Jewish Society\nto speak on the topic \" A sane\npolicy in the Middle East\". Mr Huck field although not\nhimself Jewish, declared his staunch support for Israel as\nthe only democratic socialist country in the Middle East. He did not see Israel as\na bulwark against Communism,\nor the Soviet Union; but rather\nas a place where \" democracy works\" and,\" democracy looks\nas if it has every intention of\nsurviving.\nMr Huck field expressed concern at what he s a was the\ndrift of public opinion away\nfrom Israel.

The decision, embodied\nin a motion proposed by Mr\nBrightman, President R CSU, came after the issue had been\ndiscussed by the meeting.\nMr Brightman, s pen ing the\ndiscussion, said that there\nhad been growing discontent\nover the years with NUS. \"The political aspects of\nNUS are not in line with\nstudent thinking\", he said. He thou gh t that other\nuniversities might pull out of\nNUS if IC were to do so. Several other senior officers\nof Imperial College Union were\nalso at the meeting and gave\ntheir views. Mr Ri z Shakir,\nIC UDP, urged the meeting\nto look at what NUS did. \"The Executive (of NUS) only\ndo things to further their\npolitical careers\", he said.\nReferring to the cuts in\neducation spending, Mr\nShakir said that the NUS had made no impact in its attempts\nto have these cuts reversed.\nWhat the NUS should be doing\nis to help the worse off\nstudents such as the overseas\nstudents, instead of dashing\noff to sign 17-page communiques\non the state of the world \u2014\nsomething which NUS knew\nnothing about.\nMs Mary Attenborough,\nMaths Dep Rep, however, did not feel the same way. The state of the world was important\nshe said, and claimed that the\nother speakers were adopting\na sour grapes attitude. The way to get things done was by putting in motions to national\nconference \u2014 IC did not do\nso for the Scarborough\nConference.\nMr Tony Fitzgerald, Physics Dep Rep, said that NUS had done a great deal for students.\n\"an effort is required to make\nit (NUS) more representative.\nIt is up to the individual\nstudent to put their viewpoint in the forum of NUS\"r he said.\nHe concluded: \"We must\nwork hard and democratically\nto make NUS what we want it\nto be instead of sitting on\nour backsides\".\nThis was also the line\nadopted earlier in the meeting\nby Mr Derrick Everett,\nExternal Affairs Officer.\nHowever, he did not think that\nthe time for a decision had arrived.

    "content": "4 F III X More to religion than\nceremony\nNEXT WEEK, the Imperial College Christian Union are holding a series of\ntalks to be given by Dr Peter May as part\nof their week of action. The week of\naction, the first for six years, is designed\nto awaken peoples interest in Christianity. Members of the Union will be circulating freely within the College and\nengaging them in discussion over the\nissue of Christianity.\n. Dr Peter May, pictured right, is a travelling secretary for the University\nColleges Christian Fellowship and is\nadviser to the Christian unions in Reading\nSouthampton, and Surrey universities, a a well as half the colleges in UL U \u2014 one\nOf these being I C.An amiable and sincere man, he says that he first started to think seriously about Christianity when he was 17 years\nold. He had come to question the basis of the morals which his parents were\nkeen to pass on to him and found that\nparents had no basis for their beliefs. This left him in a stare of uncertainty.\nUp till then he had only received the\nusual run of the mill religious education\nand having few Christian friends, tended\nto di miss Christianity on \" secondhand opinion\". This, he says, left him\n\" agnostic, and when the moon was\nshining, atheistic\". However, meeting his friends, who\nprofessed a personal belief in Christ\nand seeing the good quality of their\nlife made him realise that \" there was\nmore to religion than ceremony\". With an\nopen mind he set out to look into Christianity\n(he was challenged by his friends) and\nbegan to read the New Testament at the\nrate of a chapter a night \u2014 a task that\ntook nine months and left him more\nconfused than before. \u2022\n\"I had thought that after one read\nthrough of the New Testament I would be\nable to come to an intelligent, adult\ndecision about this business and dismiss it once and for all\", he says. But this\nwas not the case and it was not until he\nhad waded through the New Testament\nthree times that he became convinced\nof the truth of Christianity.\nIt was at this time that he entered\nthe Royal Free Hospital, There were\nthen very few Christians at the hospital, but within 18 months of his. arrival the\nnumber had grown to over 50. Since then he has been an active and practicing\nChristian. He believes that Christianity is more\nrelevant than ever to modern society, especially to counteract the \" social lack of concern\". There is a lot of\nconfusion between religion and\nDr Peter May\nChristianity, he says, and the churches\nshould go back to the ideas of the New\nTestament. The attempt, by the churches\nto brainwash people has In his thinking,\nfailed miserably, and is a major departure\nfrom the New Testament.\nHe hopes to meet as many people at\nIC as he can dur i rig his stay and anyone\nwho bumps into him will definitely have\ntheir ideas about Christians and\nChristianity jolted.\nA guide to the full programme for next\nweek can be found on page 2.\nRESEARCH/TRAVELLING SCHOLARSHIP\nTHE TRENT RIVER TRUST is\nproposing to award one or more\nresearch or travelling scholars hips, up to the value of\napproximately \u00a3600, for any\none or more of the following\nresearch subjects:\nthe technical, administrative\nand legal aspects of\npollution control, fisheries, river management, river\nengineering, flood alleviation, hydrology, river modelling,\nand river-based amenity and\nrecreation.\nOther fields of research may be\nconsidered by the Trustees. The\nTrustees would wish to see a study of problems relevant to\nthe River Trent.\nAny enquiries, and applications\ngiving full details of the aims\nand expected benefits of the\nresearch anticipated, together\nwith details of the programme\nof research, should be submitted\nto the Trent River Trust, c/o The Director of Administration,\nSevern-Trent Water Authority,\nAbelson House,2297 Coventry\nRoad, Sheldon, Birmingham\nB26 3 PS, to be received not\nlater than 31 March 1976.\nINVITATION\nLady Flowers, assisted by members of the IC Wives Club, welcomes students to a free BEER' N'BA NGERS nosh-up\nat 170 Queen's Gate, on Thurs, 29th Jan, from 5.30-7.00pm Names, please, to Jen, Union office, by not later than\nWednesday, 28th Jan. titbits m Surprise, surprise, Stella Godfrey agrees with quite a few of\nour comments on ICWA. We concur with a few of hers too: notably\nthat women have consistently proved themselves to be man's equal.\nStella acknowledges that 'ICWA needs a kick in the pants'. Our article was intended to help precipitate that. By the way\nStella, thanks for the comments about ICU; we'll look into it and\nreport back later.\nAll\u2014female exec?\nStill, we doubt whether women's lib. will have much to\ngrumble at, what with R CSU likely to have an all-female exec, next year. Not to mention that Fiona Cassidy' s standing for\nRSMU President!\nMs Godfrey's reply leads us to outline the aims of ' Titbits'. The column exists to stimulate discussion on relevant IC topics\nand to inform students of what's happening in the higher\n'clique^-socs' of their union. We believe the ICWA article\nsubscribes to this definition. Titbits is written by a number of\nstudents well a tuned to IC affairs. To preserve journalistic\nmobility we feel that we must a present remain anonymous.\nCongratulations to all involved on the R CSU and C& GU mascot\nswop. Certainly a novel idea which brough both union meetings\nalive. As Steve Brightman commented 'It really is a shame that\nsome people have not taken it with the spirit with which it was conceived'. Could this possibly be the start of an IC WHO, with\nco-operation between the CC Us? Mascot swop\nSomebody who didn't share Steve' s enthusiasm for the swop\nwas his VP, Chalk ie'I want to be ICU Hon Sec' White, who' s 'in charge' of R CSU mascot ry, but wasn't told of the swop until\nafter the meeting. C& GU exec can't exactly be said to be united\nover the issue either; fireworks should be flying from that\ncorner soon. At present both unions look like talking the matter\nto Extraordinary General Meetings in the hope that ordinary\nunion members can voice their views on their president's actions.\nTitbits hopes that this will see an end to the matter.\nIn the meanwhile don't forget your ticket for Guilds Dinner\nand Dance next Friday. As usual it looks like being a hive of\nelection activity with all possible ICU candidates making an\neffort to impress.\nCOPY DATE\nAll contributions for the next issue of FELIX must reach\nthe FELIX office by 2.00pm on Mon. 26th Jan.

Boomalaka\nWonderland\nmascot ry\nMASCOT RY took an unusual\ntwist last Tuesday afternoon\nwhen the Co'le ge reverberated\nto the sound of two ju bi 'ant\nC CU factions celebrating, in\ntraditional style, the capture\nof the other's mascot. The two CC U's involved were the\nRoyal College of Science and\nCity and Guilds. In abid to re juv in ate their\nunion meetings, the presidents\nof R CSU and C& GU had given\nthe go-ahead for ' a mascot\nswop- The idea of exchanging\nmascots was that of Dave\nDodge, the Theta Bearer.\nHe, together with Steve\nBrightman (President R CSU), Steve Hoyle( President C& GU) and Richard Gunnersby (Spanner\nBearer) signed a truce enabling\nthe exchange to take place. Martin Kessler, e xV PR CSU, Steve Booth, Theta Bearer,\nKeith Ahlers, ex President C& GU and the above mentioned\nfour were the only people who\nknew of the swap prior to both\nmeetings.\nThe mascots, which were\noriginally to be exchanged\noutside College at 12.45pm, were eventually swopped at\n1.01pm. It was a close thing\nwhether the swop took place because Mr Dodge found\ndifficulty in assembling the\nfour sections of Theta and\nhad to call in Mr Kessler to\nhim.\nThe mascots were later\nre-swopped outside College after both meetings had ended.\nInitial reaction to the\nexchange was unsympathetic;\nmany loyal supporters, on\nboth sides, were upset at\nthis betrayal of faith by their\nUnion presidents. Nevertheless,\nboth meetings did get off to a good start and by the end of\nthe day many of those upset\nat being duped had begun to\nsee the funny side of the\nepi so de. Chemical\nArson\nLast Wednesday evening,\na young man was found in the\nChemistry Building apparently\ntrying to set fire to it. The youth, aged about 16, had\nspread an organic solvent\nover the wooden floor of the\nHarwood Laboratory. He was discovered in the doorway\nof the laboratory by Dr Fleet. This discovery was made at\nabout 9.30pm. It was a timely\ndiscovery because had the\nfire taken hold it would have\nspread to many gallons of highly\nin fla mable materials and\nindeed the building would have\nburnt like match wood. The youth was discovered\ncrouched over the blazing remains of a laboratory coat.\nHe immediately extinguished\nthe flames and walked out\nof the laboratory and into the\ncorridor ac com pained by Dr Fleet. The latter was attempting\nto question the offender when\nhe bolted down the corridor\nand escap ed via a set of\nstairs.\nThe Security Officer has put out notices giving the\nfollowing detailed di script ion of the youth. He is about 5 feet\n8 inches tall, of medium build, short brownish hair, dark eyes, and has a thin face with a sharp nose.\nAt the time, he was wearing\na light blue track suit decorated\nwith numerous bad.ges one\nof which bore the inscription\nKa masaki. He was also wearing what was thought to\nbe a hearing aid but could have been a transistor radio\near piece. This followed a less serious incident in the Huxley Building which took place the\npreceding' Monday night.\nRemains of a burnt display\npaper were discovered at about\n11.20pm by one of the security\nguards. No serious damage\nresulted.\nThe Security officer would be most interested in any\ninformation in connection\nwith either of these incidents. The police have been\ninformed and there is no\ncircumstantial evidence to\nlink the two.\nImperial College Union\nGeneral Meeting\nTHURSDAY29 th JAN. at1 p.m. IN THE GREAT HALL\nKangala\n\n"

    "content": "X Residential-short term\nprivately owned property\nHERE IS good news for all of\nyou who cannot afford to pay\n\u00a312 a week for a single room in\nEaling. Westminster City Council has a scheme, still in its early stages, for using\nshort life privately owned\nproperty, the owners of which are willing to make it available on agreed terms. The Council's intention is to accommodate\nmainly single people already\nliving in Westminster. As with many authorities, Westminster has a large number of\nprivately owned properties\nand with the object of putting\nsome of these properties\nback into occupation, its\ncouncil on 29th September\n1975 approved a scheme for\ntheir short term use in cases in which their owners are\nwilling to co-operate.\nThe main points of the\nscheme are as follows:1. Arrangements between\nPrivate Owners and the\nCouncil. a) Length of tenure.\nBy negotiation with individual owners but with a minimum period of six months\nfor both unfurnished and\nfurnished properties and with\na minimum period of notice\nof three months on either\nside. b) Rent\nFair rent less estimated\nrunning expenses for repairs\nand management.\nc) Repairs\nOwners will be asked to\ncarry out initial repairs as\nnecessary. Repairs during the\nCouncil's tenure (other than\nthose which will be the\ntenant's responsibility) will be carried out by the council. Such repairs will be done\nonly in consultation with the\nowner who will have the\noption if he does not agree,\nof terminating his agreement\nwith the Council. d) Vetting o1 Tenants\nOwners will have an\nopportunity to vet tenants\nselected for their properties\nby the Council. e) Vacant possession on\ntermination\nIt will be the Council's responsibility to ensure this.2. Arrangements between the\nCouncil and tenant\na) Selection of tenants\nPriority will be given to\nsingle people on the basis of\nno liability by the Council to re house at the end of its\ntenure of the property.\nb) Tenure\nWeekly tenancies\nc) Rent\nFair rent, rebated as\nappropriate in individual\ncases. d) Repairs\nTenants responsibility will be limited to minor repairs\nand decorations.\ne) Deposits\nTenants will pay a deposit\nequivalent to four week's rent returnable on termination\nof the tenancy provided a) the rent account is clear b) there\nis no damage to the dwelling\nc) the Council recovers vacant\npossession of the dwelling <\non the agreed date.\nWestminster City Council say that students may only\napply individually so there is\nno possibility of the Union\ntaking over property on-block.\nFurther information may be\nobtained from.\nCC/H GUY Director of Housing\nWestminster City Hall Victoria Street\nLondon SW1E 6 0 L Telephone 828 8070\nD Rawnsley\nStudent Residence Officer\nContinued from page 7\nLETTERS IC crest\nSir, \u2014 This College has one\nof the most distinguished\ncoat of arms in British heraldry,\nto display the entire \" Royal Arms\" in differenced is something that not even the Prince of Wales is permitted to do.\nHowever, the artistic standard\nof the portrayals of the arms\nseems always to have been\nbad and the latest version on\nthe IC slop shirts is disgracefully\ninaccurate.\n, The bone of contention is\nthe line dividing trie royal\nbit from the book bit.

    "content": "mix7 Rape and\nthe Law\n'WHY does a man feel a need to rape a woman? and\n'How do we improve the\ncurrent rape situation beyond\nnew legislation?' These were\ntwo outstanding questions\nat the end of the ICWA debate\non 'Rape and the Law', last\nTuesday.\nOne solution to the second\nquestion favoured by the\nNational Council for Civil Liberties( N CCL), is the\nestablishment of Rape Crisis Centres throughout Britain. These already exist in the\nUSA, providing a24 hour\nphone-in service offering\nmedical and legal advice to\nrape victims. They also\nprovide a more sympathetic\near to victims than the police do, claimed Jean Cousins from N CCL. One such centre\nwas set up in London a month ago.\nAnother solution came from\nJack Gratus, author of a recent article on rape in the\nmagazine 'Over 21' and a book\n' The Victim'. He suggested\nthat society needed re-educating\non its attitudes to women and\nrape. Growing numbers of\nwomen involved in the\nadministration of law (women\nsolicitors, women judges etc)\nwould help to change the\nsituation.\nBoth speakers outlined\nthe current legal situation\non rape and agreed on the\ncurrent problems. They agreed\nto differ in the causes of\nthe problems and how to\ntackle them. Whilst both\nappreciated the need to strike\na balance between the rights\nof rape victims and defendants,\nMs Cousins felt the latter\nwere well protected after a recent Law Lords ruling.\nThe ruling, supported by\nN CCL, says that a man\ncannot be convicted of rape\nif he honestly believes his\nvictim \u2022 consented to inter-course, even when her wishes were the complete opposite.\nThe meeting went on\nwelcome the acceptance of\nthe Heilbon Commission's Report on current Rape Laws. Its proposals, published in\nDecember, are incorporated\nin a private members bill, sponsored by MP Robin\nCorbitt. The bill should get\nits second reading in\nParliament during February.\nMs Cousins and Mr Gratus\nboth opposed the current\npractice of defence lawyers\ntrying to blacken rape victims'\ncharacters with questions such\nas, 'Are you on the Pill?', 'How many lovers have you\nhad?', 'How many men have\nyou had?', 'How many men\nhave you slept with?', ect.\nThey felt that this gave the\nimpression that the rape\nvictim was on trial, and not\nher assailant. All the same\nboth stressed the difficulties\nof juries in rape trials. Often\nthey had to decide whether\nthe man or the woman was\ntelling the truth with little\ncorroborative evidence.\nMs Cousins also attacked\nanother common line of defence,\n'She did not resist enough'.\nIf a girl forced to have sex\nat knife or pistol - point, she\nsaid, it might not be in her\nbest interests to resist.\nIn the ensuing discussion, A AO, Rick Parker, suggested\nthat the media falsely defined\nthe average man's sexual\nyardstick as that of a successful playboy. Perhaps rapists\nwere men lacking sex esteem,\nwho bemoaned their inability\nto live this playboy image.\nA lot of discussion centred\naround Mr Gratus's article in\n'Over 2 1 ' . In it he asked\nwomen to be conscious of\ncurrent society and realise\nthat in certain circumstances\nthey might be able to minimize\nthe chance of getting raped or\nassaulted through sensible\naction. Several speakers\nfelt the accent should be\nmore on social and legal\n' changes rather than this\nto 'stop-gap' approach.\nWANTED\nSingle girl looking for a room\nin the area.

Both\ndiscussions seemed to be characterised by a lack of\nknowledge of the situation and in the Guilds meeting they\nquite rightly decided not to take a decision on the issue. However, the RCS meeting did take decision in favour\nof remaining within NUS and passed a motion to that effect.\nThe question now is not really whether we should\nd is affiliate or not but what we will' do if we do stay in. it is essential that a situation is not reached whereby\nall th os colleges discussing the question of d is affiliation decide to remain within NUS and then do nothing to make\nNUS more representative of the views. And this is the crux of the matter,. Will we, when we\ndecide not to leave NUS, just sit back and content ourselves\nwith the fact that the boat has been rocked again? One\nsincerely hopes not. For it is only by the individual\nstudent participating in NUS, making his or her view known\nwithin the forum of the National Union, that any change\ncan be achieved. Voting to stay in should not mean that we do not want\nto lose NUS Travel etc, but that we want to use our\nposition inside the NUS to try and make it a body which represents not only the small percentage of political( mostly extreme left wing) activists, but also the majority\nof non-activist students in its membership.\nIt is time we got off our arse and took action instead\nof b lee ting about the fact that the NUS does not represent\nus. No one will listen to you unless you say something and\nthe time has come for us to stand up and say it. So speak\nup and for goodness sake, speak up now and loudly. You will remember that NUS is to set up a newspaper,\nNational Student ( FELIX No.406); Jeremy Clift, last\nyear's Sennet editor, is to help out with it, on a not entirely\nvoluntary basis. He left Sennet last November.\nTo get back to IC, the election wagon is on its way\nagain \u2014 soon our ears will be ringing to the chants and\nproclamations of candidates for this post and that. This year, your eyeballs will suffer too, as the amount of\npublicity is expected to be greater and better than ever.\nFELIX will be keeping a very close watch on all the\nevents.
