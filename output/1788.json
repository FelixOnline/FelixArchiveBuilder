While restoring the Cathedral the\ncolumns were searched for, but in vain. In\nthe end a journalist decided to take photos\nof all columns in the University. One\nevening, while doing this, an office-clean-er told him that these four are in Rector\u2019s\noffice. And indeed they had been left - the\nUniversity is the Temple of Science.\u201d\nPerhapsabettertitleforThomasHuxley\u2019s \u2018Emancipation: Black & White\u2019\nwould have been \u2018Emancipation: Man &\nWoman\u2019. Barring the opening few para-graphs, the essay concerns the inequality\nbetween men and women in education\nand their asymmetric roles in society.\nHuxley believed that, allowing even for\nthemostcommonreasonsmalechauvin-ists gave for excluding the opposite sex\nfrom this or that arena, reasons which\nhe himself held in low regard, women\u2019s\noppression was only injustice and their\nemancipation would bring only good to\nhumanity.\nHuxley wrote his essay shortly after\nthe conclusion of the American Civil War had brought the institution of\nSouthern slavery to an end across the\nAtlantic.HeusedtheBlackslaves\u2019emancipation as an anchor for his message of\nwomen\u2019s liberation. As an abolitionist,\nhe was heartened by the freedom the\nformer slaves had attained. Yet, it is true\nthat he espoused in this essay a racial hierarchy of intelligence, as alleged by the\nImperial College\u2019s Historical Group. He\ndid not believe that \u201cThe average neg** is\nthe equal, still less the superior, of the average white man ... it is simply incredible\nthat...hewillbeabletocompetewithhis\nbigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival.\u201d\nThesesentimentswereheavilymotivated\nby the discipline of craniology. The predictions of craniology\nhave since been discredited and it is no\nlonger seriously prac-ticed. Modern genetics sheds light on the\nquestion of race and\nintelligence which\ncraniology tried and\nfailed to tackle: there\nis no correlation between the genes that\ndetermine a person\u2019s\nracial identifiers, such\nas skin colour, eye lid\nshape, etc., and the\nindividual\u2019s intelli-gence. That is to say,\nthat racial equality in\nthe sense of intelligence has been established as a matter of\nfact.\nThere has also been\nanother related, but\nvery different, development since Huxley wrote his essay. In\nhis time, an integrated multi-racial society was completely outside the popular\nimagination, even among most classical\nprogressives (among whom we count\nHuxley). Today, on on the other hand,\nmulti-ethnic mul-ti-culturalismisacore\ntenet of liberal pro-gressivism. As part\nof this transition, the\ntruth of racial equality has been enshrined\nin our culture. In this\ncontext, racial equality is understood to\nbe self-evident, or in\nother words, it is understood as a matter\nof faith.\nThe role of values\nand faith in human\nsociety and culture is\nnot well understood,\nand what has been\nsaidofitwecouldnot\nhope to summarise\nhere. Suffice it is to\nsay that for one reason or another, faith\noften plays a role in\nour societies that fact\ncould not. In view of this, to embrace\nequality as a core belief may even be necessary for the cohesion of a multi-ethnic\nsociety. But in a liberal democracy, such\nas ours, there are certain institutions\nwhose role is not simply to manifest the\nvalues of that society at any given time,\nbut to preserve and seek universal truths\nthat supersede the values of any people\nanywhere and at any time. These are the\nliberal institutions, traditionally the universities and colleges.\nIndeed, our culture and values are\nthe manifestations of fleeting popular\nconsciousness and our fickle collective\nmemory, and faith and prejudice are two\nsides of the same coin. The self-evidence\nof racial equality is simply an expression\nof our egalitarian prejudice. Granted,\nwhen it comes to prejudice one could\ndo worse than egalitarianism, but it is a\nprejudice nonetheless. There are parts of\nthe world today, among the democratic,\nlawfulplaces,whereracialequalityisnot\nany more assumed than any other claim\nabout the natural world. This is not be-causethepeopleoftheseplacesareunen-lightened, but because they do not share\nour egalitarian faith. Yet scientific racial\nequality is as true in one place as it is in\nanother, and it is as true at one time as it\nis at another. But inevitably, challenging\ntheories will arise at different places and\nat different times. In fact, they are budding all around us today.\nWe must be able to defend the truth\nagainst such challengers not merely\nwith righteous proclamations, but with\nthe evidence from which they can be\nimpartially established, else we risk losing ground against false theories whose\nagentscan,ataparticularplaceandtime,\nseem more righteous than ourselves.\nThis, to protect natural, universal truths\nagainst unworthy challengers, is the\nprimary task and duty of any body that\ndares to call itself a liberal institution.\nThis Olympian responsibility cannot be\nfulfilled if the institution is to allow itself to be swayed by the prejudices that\nimmediately surround it, or even those\nthat occupy its halls. Although any particular prejudice may champion some\nconclusions that agree with our best theories of the world, it will be useless in defending those conclusions.

Our faith is just as likely to\nchangefortheworseasitistochangefor\nthe better. In recent times we have found\nfalse comfort in the now-conventional\nwisdom that the arc of history bends towards justice. This false hope is another\nartefactofourbiasestoday.Infactitmay\nbesaidtobeanexampleofhistoricalsur-vivorship bias. As even the most cursory\nsurvey of the arc of history will reveal, it\nbends whichever way it is forced. Hence,\nan institution that couples itself with the\nculture and faith of any people will inevitably find that it is unable to defend\nthis faith against ideological aggressors\n(regardless of the voracity of the faith),\nand also that this faith on which it has\nrested its foundation is not constant,\nbut ever-changing, with little regard\nfor universal truths or facts. Such an institution would be more akin to a local\ngallery that curates its collection to cater\nto its audience\u2019s idiosyncratic tastes than\nto a world leading university that seeks\nto preserve and advance knowledge of\nscientific truths. Such a body could be\na successful cultural institution, but it\ncould never be a liberal institution.\nIn the context of the removal of references to Thomas Huxley on the South\nKensington campus of Imperial College,\nLondon, this has the following conse-quences: the college must decide whether it considers racial equality to be foremost a matter of fact, or a matter of faith\nand prejudice. Crucially, one cannot at\nthe same instance consider racial equality both a matter of fact and a matter of\nfaith, since these two starting points so\noften lead to irreconcilable ends. Considering the case of Huxley and taking\nview of his abolitionism and his activism\nin favour of the marginalised in his time,\nwe can say with some conviction that his\nerroneous ideas about a racial hierarchy\nof intelligence were not motivated by\nmaliceorhatred,butwerethegenuinere-sult of errors in his understanding of the\nworld. So, if racial equality is a matter of\nfact, then Huxley deserves no blame for\nhis misconceptions, since they arose not\nfrom malice but through false theories\nof the world, in particular, demonstrably\nfalse claims about race. Indeed, to blame\nHuxley for his views on race would be\nto condemn Newton for his formulation of absolute space and time. Since\nNewton\u2019s theory also arose from faults\nin understanding, leading to demonstrably false predictions. Such renunciation\nof past scholars would have grave consequences for all academics at the college\ntoday. We all investigate the nature of\nthis world, but all our theories of it, in\nspite of incremental improvements, are\nultimately incomplete and mistaken. If\nthis immutable nature of our work, that\nis, the incompleteness of our theories, is\ngrounds for us to be ostracised, then we\ncannot safely inquire into the nature of\nthis universe. Therefore, if the college\nunderstands racial equality to be a matter of fact, but still chooses to disown\nHuxley\u2019s legacy by removing references\nto him on College grounds, then it must\nabandon any and all claims to being a\nliberal institution. In fact, by following\nthis course of action, the college would\nnot only be abandoning its own claims\nto liberalism, it would be rejecting liberalism altogether.\nOn the other hand, if the college understands racial equality to be first of all\na matter of our egalitarian faith (on cam-pus, in London, in the UK and broadly across the West), then indeed, it may\ndistance itself from the Huxley name\nwhile avoiding an outright rejection of\nliberalism. Indeed, if racial equality is a\nmatter of faith, then Huxley, as a heretic,\ndeserves no less blame and condemnation than a heretic who might appear on\ncampus today. However, in the process,\nby tying itself to the popular interpreta-tionofracialequalityasamatteroffaith,\nthecollegewillhaveunderstoodandfor-mulated itself as a cultural institution, so\nthat in future it will no longer have the\nlegitimacy to strive to seek and defend\nuniversal truths, and shall instead be\nconfined to the curation of its collection\nto the tastes of prospective students.\nWhether universities around the\nworld formulate the principle of racial\nequality as a matter of fact or a matter\nof faith will prove to be a deciding factor for the future of our world. But as far\nas the future of Imperial College is con-cerned, the disavowing of Huxley\u2019s legacy shall be the unequivocal end of the\ncollege as a liberal institution, regardless\nofthisrathertechnicaldistinction.Since\nit will henceforth resemble a Sunday\nschool far more than any liberal body, it\nmay be best if the college no longer characterised itself as a \u2018college\u2019 or a \u2018university\u2019. Afterall, honesty is a cornerstone of\nany faith.\nIn the 20th century, when the ideas\nof purity and perfection were at their\npeak, failure was extremely frowned\nupon because people associated it with\nimperfection, and defective products\nshould be discarded. Instead, our grandparents admired the successful man,\nflawless in whatever they do in life, with\nmoney, health, and sex appeal. This was\nthe model to follow but this was mostly out of reach for most people, which\nderived into a futile frustration among\nthe population as they appeared to be\nnot good enough - worthless individuals in a society that demands greatness.\nHowever, the ideal was unrealistic and\neven the people who seemed to achieve\nit were not at 100% compliance with\nthis model of greatness. Instead, what\nthey did superbly was save their appear-ances. They could \u2018buy\u2019 evidence of skills\nand achievements. Need to show you\nare smarter than other people? Do not\nworry, if you donate a building to X university (like Harvard, ehem), you can get\nin without satisfying the entry require-ments. There are many news articles\nabout nepotism and biased admisissions\nat Harvard online. Need to show your\nkindness? Fund a charity with the spare\nmillions of pounds in your pockets. Instagram, or any other type of social me-FAILURE is much better than\nSUCCESS\nSuccess is a mirage, behind it there is only ego and conformity.\nWangGuo\nCommentWriter\nPhoto credits: Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\n"

The\nproposal was passed by Council with\n29 votes for, 1 against and 2 abstaining.\nEDI and financial issues were\nsome of those raised in opposition\nto the statue\u2019s installation.\nAn amendment to the paper that\ntabled the proposition, suggesting that\ntheUnionreferonlytotheQueen\u2019sLawn\narea as \u2018Dongoor Plaza\u2019 from now on\nwas rejected. Felix is chagrinned by this.\nThe paper sparked controversy within\nthe Union, due to a figure contained in\nthe paper fully depicting two possible\nperceptions of the statue\u2019s form, which\ncan be seen in the image accompanying\nthis article. Fighting fire with fire, the\nfigure is used to show how the statue\ncan be perceived as phallic, by even\nmore explicitly showing said phallus.\nFollowing certain, unspecified\nmeddling within the Union, a retracted\nversion of the paper was distributed\nshortly after the first, but with the\ndiagram\u2019s modesty slightly more in tact.\nThe paper also expressed\ncomplaint that students had\nnot been consulted prior to\nALERT\u2019s installation being agreed.\nOne of the Union\u2019s resolves will\nbe to share this paper, including the\naccompanying diagrams, with \u201cCollege\nCouncil and other relevant members\nof the college\u201d. It is also stated that\n\u201cIf the phallic interpretation is not\nunderstood by the College, [the\ndiagram] should be used to explain\nthe ambiguous anatomy of Alert\u201d.\nThe statue, donated by alumnus\nBrahmal Vasudevan and his\nwife Shanthi Kandiah, is set\nto be installed this summer.\nIt will weigh 67 tonnes\nand be 6.12 meters tall.\nThe statue has been designed by\nprominent sculptor Antony Gormley,\nwho said \u201cThe work will beckon\ntowards the passers-by on Exhibition\nRoad, providing a point of interest and\nintrigue, and encouraging a closer look\u201d.\n\n"

A blatant disregard for the\nrules that he himself had set, and his\ndefence is that one of his underlings\ndid it all without his knowledge.

How does one elevate\ntheir mind through simply being still and breathing?\nMindfulness sessions held at my secondary school\nelicited much amusement: a room full of teenagers\nsitting or lying on the floor with their eyes closed,\ndoing nothing but breathing in and out, what a\nlaugh! And I carried this mindset around until\nreaching university and, along with it, the pandemic.\nIwon\u2019tpretendthatCOVID-19didn\u2019tplayapartin\nmychangeofheart(ormindrather)\u2013itdefinitelydid\u2013\nbut I don\u2019t believe it was that alone. Starting university\nmeans a big leap in independence, workload, and\npressure to socialise with peers, among other things.\nWiththatoftencomessome(orall)ofthethreebiggest\nnames in mental illness: stress, anxiety, and depression.\nThe aim of meditation is actually not\nto think about our thoughts,\nbut to stop doing for a moment\nand let our thoughts pass\nwithout reaction. It teaches\nus to have thoughts without\nconstantly acting upon them,\nallowing them to flow more\nclearly without piling up.\n\u2018Overthinking\u2019 is a common side effect of\nmental illnesses, and meditation trains us to free\nourselvesfromthisonslaughtofthoughts(many\nof them negative) and stop worrying\nfor a while.\nMy mum had previously invested in a\n\u2018Headspace\u2019 family plan. \u2018Headspace\u2019 is a\nmindfulness app, created by monk-turned-entrepreneur Andy Puddicombe,\nfull of guided meditations and\nother related tools for getting\nin the right headspace. I was\nskeptical of it at first, but as stresses and worries\npiled up, I found myself looking for relief, and\neventually investigated what the app offered.\nThe guided meditations are led by a few different\nteachers, which can be chosen by the listener, and\nPuddicombe does many of them himself. They range\nfrom as little as three minutes up to an hour, and span\na variety of topics, including anxiety, sleep, dealing\nwith change, and many more. The app also provides\nsleep aids such as ambient sounds and sleep podcasts\nfor those who have trouble hitting the hay, and guided\nmindful runs, workouts, and yoga to encourage\nstaying present while being active. It even has tidbits\nof recordings from celebrities on a host of topics;\nKevin Hart on energy boosts and mindful cardio, and\nHans Zimmer and Erykah Badu with focus music.\nEven if meditation isn\u2019t your thing, the soothing\nvoices of the recordings are enough to\nrelax you for a while. It can be done\nsitting or lying still, or even while\nperforming basic\ntasks during\nthe day, and there\u2019s no\nright or wrong way, although they\nrecommend trying to stay as undistracted\nas possible. It forces you to take a break\nfrom the world and be present with yourself.\nNow, you may be wondering why this article has\nbeen placed in the sports section. It has nothing to do\nwith sport! Well, this is where science comes in: it has\nbeen shown that mental wellbeing greatly influences\nphysical health, and vice versa. Long-time depression\nor anxiety can be the source of gastrointestinal\nissues or heart disease, while sedentary lifestyles\nor chronic pain can lead to depressive symptoms.\nI also had a go at using other features in the\napp, yoga being one of them. I had always \u2013\narrogantly \u2013 thought that yoga wasn\u2019t so\nhard, that surely anyone can perform\nsome stretching and bending on a\nmat? I was horribly wrong: yoga is not for the weak.\nA few rounds of Sun Salutations and I\u2019m already\n(embarrassingly) breaking a sweat. For those of us\nthat may not get out for exercise as much as we\u2019d\nlike, or who don\u2019t particularly enjoy crunches and\nweightlifting, yoga can serve as a decent strength\nworkout without even having to leave the house (as\nwas necessary during lockdown). Where possible, it\nshould be complemented with other forms of exercise\n\u2013particularlycardiosuchaswalkingandrunning\u2013but\nit\u2019s great if you\u2019re short on time, or just want a quick\nbreak from sitting down. Of course, it can also serve\nas a complement to existing workouts; yoga has long\nbeen considered a way to stretch out and release tired\nmuscles, and is useful as an active recovery technique.\nAt the time I had also started using the \u2018Nike\nTraining Club\u2019 (NTC) app \u2013 a free workout app\nthat contains a range of strength, endurance, and\nmobility workouts, as well as yoga classes \u2013 and \u2018Nike\nRunning Club\u2019 (NRC), which provides audio for\nguided runs, and can record their statistics. NRC\neven has collaborations with Headspace. I find\nrunning is also a good escape for the mind, and pairs\nwell with a yoga-based warm-up or cool-down, but\nwalking is also an underrated form of exercise. The\nNTC app offers both restorative (yin) and energetic,\nactive (yang) yoga practices. In both types, practising\nrhythm and stability can have a calming, grounding\neffect, which is particularly beneficial in Covid times.\nI am still, personally, not a regular practitioner of\nmeditation\u2013Ifindithardtositstillformorethanafew\nminutes without itching to get on with something else\n\u2013 but even a few minutes of meditation per day or week\ncanbebeneficialtoone\u2019smentalstate.Yogahasbecome\naregularpartofmyroutine\u2013amixtureofshortandlong\nsessions scattered throughout the week \u2013 and while I\nhaven\u2019t yet conquered the \u2018Kakasana\u2019 (Crow Pose) and\notherinversions,Ihavenodoubtthatmyflexibilityand\nstrength have increased over time.

Plant-based food consumes much less of the planet\u2019s resources and seems to\nhave countless other benefits. So, what\u2019s the beef with\nplant-based food?\nOver the past two years I have learnt about the vast\nand intricate network of factors that contribute to our\ncollapsing world. It still amazes me that the milk from\na latte makes it ten times worse for the climate than a\ncup of black coffee. Joining the dots between diets and\npandemics is one of the reasons why I chose to change\nwhatIeat.Iknewthecarbonemissionsfrommeatwere\nhigh, but learning about the following issues with meat\nand dairy really affected me.\nPandemics\nThere are two ways for pandemics to come from livestock farming: (i) antibiotic resistance; and (ii) mutated viral transmission between species.\nGlobally, 73% of medically important antibiotics are\nfed to animals and this gives more opportunity for\nbacteria to adapt, dodge antibiotic protection, and\ncreate another pandemic. By 2050, drug-resistant microbes will lead to ten million deaths every year if the\nproblem is not solved . For context, the 2020 death toll\nfrom Covid-19 was over around 3 million . Limiting\nmeat intake worldwide to 40 g/day could reduce global\nconsumption of antimicrobials by livestock by 66% - a\nhuge reduction - and consuming a plant-based diet reduces this to zero.\nThe cramped conditions and cross-over with wildlife\nfrom industrial farming and wildlife farming is also\ngiving disease more opportunity to adapt to jump\nacross species. When wildlife interacts with farmed an-imals, such as migrating birds flying into chicken sheds,\nthere are many opportunities for a virus to mutate and\njump between species. There are lots of chickens \u2013 they\nmake up 71% of all bird biomass on Earth \u2013 so bird flu\nviruses are waiting in the wings.\nLand use\nWhile meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories\nglobally, they use the vast majority \u2013 83% \u2013 of farmland . A typical UK meat and dairy consumer requires\n10,000 m2 of land (1.5 football pitches) per year, and\na plant-based diet can reduce this to 2000 m2 (3 penalty boxes). A plant-based diet would take pressure off\ntearing down the world\u2019s tropical forests and bring our\nplanet\u2019s ecology back towards a healthy equilibrium.\nPesticides\n80% of the world\u2019s soya crop is fed to livestock, and\n51% of soya crops are sprayed with \u2018highly hazardous\npesticides\u2019 such as glyphosate . Cocktails of pesticides\nhave been shown to kill 96% of exposed pollinators ,\nwhich is a huge problem. Losing pollinators would be\ndevastatingtofoodproduction,andalreadyweseepeo-ple having to pollinate some crops by hand because of\nthe decimation of insects. We would consume around\nthirty times more crops through a cow than if we ate\nthe crops directly, and this vast amount of crops needed to feed animals requires high yields and therefore\nhigh pesticide use. Plant-based diets reduce the need\nfor such a high yield, and therefore can be grown more\norganically. By eating organic, locally grown plant-based foods, this environmental and ecological damage\nis reduced.\nEutrophication\nA green ooze of algae is produced when nitrogen and\nphosphorus from cattle farm run-off and chicken manure flow into rivers and coastlines, which starve the\nwater of oxygen and kill other life. A plant-based diet\ncan reduce this by 49% . To achieve the high yields\nneeded to feed livestock, fertilisers are used excessively.\nThese also contribute to eutrophication.\nWater and Methane\nA pint of milk requires around 350 litres of water (over\na bathtub). Water is a resource that will run out if we\nextract it from the ground faster than it can be replaced\nand this is a significant issue in water-stressed regions.\nAs the globe heats up, glaciers shrink and rainfall patterns change, meaning fresh water becomes scarce. Reducing water consumption is important. A diet with a\n50% reduction in animal products would reduce total\nwater use by 37% . Atmospheric methane reached a record high in Sept 2021 at 1900 ppb, compared to 1638\nppb (1983) and 722 ppb (1750), where 30% of current\nanthropogenic methane is from livestock .\nWater is a significant issue in growing certain nuts, too\n(almonds require around 3 gallons of water per nut ),\nand they are typically grown in areas where water is\nscarce. Rice requires a lot of water from typically wa-ter-stressed regions, and it produces a lot more methane than, say, UK-grown potatoes. But let\u2019s keep this\nin perspective: cattle produces 100kg of CO2e per\nkg, whereas rice produces 4.5kg. Californian cattle requires 1.5 times more water than Californian almonds.\nFor this reason, I wouldn\u2019t replace my cow\u2019s milk with\nalmond milk, but as oats can grow in the UK and use\n13 times less water than cow\u2019s milk.\nStone-cold statistics like these might convince some-Continued on next page...\nFRIDAY 14TH JANUARY 2022\n19\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nPlant-Based Propaganda\nOpinion\nWritten by Pete Knapp Staff Writer\nFood\nImage credits: Generated by Matej Genci (4th Year DoComputing)\nInspired by graphic \u201cEath\u2019s Land Animals by Weight\u201con xkcd.com\nLivestock more than outnumber humans 2 to 1.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nThe BBC\u2019s new five-part documentary series The Green Planet with\nDavid Attenborough has started off\nstrong, with an inside view into the\nlives of tropical plants. It has delivered\non its promise to explore the \u201cdramatic, beautiful plant life of Earth\u201d. New\ntechnology, including robot systems,\nthermal cameras and macro frame-stack-ing allowed the plant\u2019s lives to be put on\ndisplay in all of their drama. The team\u2019s\nnew time-lapse camera, Triffid, designed\nby ex-military engineer Chris Field during his spare time over the last decade,\nallowed the plants\u2019 lives to be revealed\nto us in their own time scale and let us\nmove through the trees like a meandering fly. It took the audience on a journey\nthrough the creaking, groaning, and\ngrowing trees, the grappling arms of\nvines, and the unfurling and withering\nof flowers that emerge and disappear in\na fraction of a plant\u2019s lifetime. It was the\nperfect tool to demonstrate the incredibly dynamic lives of plants, and allowed\nus to compare their time scale to that of\nthe animals, other plants, and fungi they\ninteract with. The time and effort put\ninto this series (five years!) could not\ngo unnoticed (and I think that effort\nwas neatly summed up by assistant producer Louis Rummer-Downing, who\ndescribed his life during the 8 days that\nit took to film the spectacular leaf-cut-ter ant sequence that required shots at\n7,000 different angles: \u201cWake up. Film\nants. Go to sleep. Dream of ants. Wake\nup\u2026.\u201d.) We were invited to awe at the\nworld\u2019s largest flower, and be showered\nby thousands of dipterocarp seeds. This\nseries also comes at an opportune moment as plants are gaining increasingly\nmore well-deserved attention.\nIn David Attenborough\u2019s words, \u201cthe\nworld has suddenly become plant conscious\u201d, which allows the episode\u2019s parting message to resonate deeper. It touches on the devastating destruction that\ntropical forests are sustaining, with 70%\nof all rainforest plants growing within a\nmile of a road or clearing that humans\nhave cut. Despite this appalling statistic,\nand the shocking images of vast swathes\nof monocultures and fragmented rainforest within barren land, the final tone\nis a refreshing one of hope. David Attenborough leaves us in new forest, with the\nhope that more pathways can be made\nbetween fragmented forest areas to preserve biodiversity. Tune in on BBC iPlayer or BBC One at 7pm on Sunday for\nfurther plant wonders in water worlds,\nseasonal worlds, desert worlds, and human worlds. It\u2019s worth a watch.\nGreen Planet: Some beautiful insight\ninto the dynamic lives of plants\nCara Burke Science Editor\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia - Ylem\n\u201cFoxfire\u201d - the bioluminescence produced by certain fungi, is featured in the programme.\n`\nThis week in Science...\nT cells from common colds could prevent SARS-CoV-2\ninfection\nThe history of Antarctica\u2019s ice provides insight into how\nvulnerable it will be to warming\nOxygen-rich exoplanets could be geologically active\nResearchers at Imperial have found that T cells from common cold coro-naviruses can not only recognise SARS\u2013CoV-2, but can protect people against infection from it. In September 2020, 52 people who lived\nwith someone with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested.\nBlood samples were taken within 1 to 6 days of their exposure to analyse\npre-existing T cell levels. The 26 participants with higher T cell counts\nwere significantly less likely to be infected. These results could allow the\ndevelopment of a vaccine that provides longer-lasting protection, as T\ncells target internal proteins, which mutate at a much lower rate than the\nspike proteins which current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines respond to.\nImperial researchers working as part of the International Ocean Discovery programme examined Antarctic ice sheets from the early Miocene,\naround 16 to 18 million years ago, which experienced both warm and\ncold periods. They found that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) was\nlarger than thought during cold periods, so could have contributed more\nto sea-level rise, which could reach levels of 60 metres during warmer pe-riods. They drilled into sediments in the Ross Sea to find layers corresponding to the warmer and colder periods, and found material deposited by the WAIS far out, which suggests it grew larger than previously\nthought. This will allow better predictions of how the WAIS will respond\nto warming, which is important as it is currently considered particularly\nvulnerable.\nRocks exposed to high oxygen concentrations melt at lower temper-atures, a new study has found. This suggests that oxygen-rich rocky exoplanets could have a liquid mantle and be geologically active. The researchers measured the melting temperature of synthetic, iron-free basalt\nrock and found that as molten rock cooled to below 1000 \u00b0C, those that\nhadbeeninoxygen-richairremainedmoltenfortemperatures100\u00b0Cbelow oxygen-depleted samples. It is possible that oxygen enables chains of\nsilicon and oxygen to be broken up into smaller, more mobile fragments.\nUnderstanding oxygen\u2019s impact could allow us to understand exoplanets\u2019\nhistory and geology better.\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nRaunchy dolphins! New study suggests dolphin\u2019s clitoris is\nmuch like a human\u2019s\nA new look at the bottlenose dolphin\u2019s clitoris has revealed that it shares\nmany similarities with the human clitoris, allowing it a vital role in pleas-ure. There is an abundance of sensory nerves and spongy tissue, possibly\nallowing it to be highly sensitive to physical touch. This research provides\ninsight into why dolphins have such active sex lives, including female-fe-male sex by way of stimulating each other\u2019s clitoris, and masturbation by\nrubbing their clitoris on objects. CT scans and dissection has revealed\nmany structural similarities with the human clitoris. Researchers even\nfound genital corpuscles: encapsulated sensory nerve endings known as\n\u201ccorpuscles of pleasure\u201d in humans. The enlarged clitoris is likely to have\nevolved for bonding and pleasure-seeking during sex, but alternative hypotheses suggest that it could be a reflection of its shared embryological\nroot with the penis, or play a role in stimulating ovulation.\n\n"

    "content": "Edited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n18 Books.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBook Review\nThe Humour Code\nAcurious book in which the authors, Peter\nMcGraw and Joel Warner, unravel the\nmechanisms behind humour. Through travelling\nto different places around the world, each more\nunusual than the previous one, including Los Angeles,\nJapan, and the Amazon, they look at humour across\nthe globe. Their objective: to investigate different\ncultures\u2019 approach to humour while gaining a greater\nunderstanding of humour itself. The format is\ninteresting because it combines a research journal with\na narrative tone.\nA key concept of this book is the theory of benign\nviolation. This defends the notion that humour comes\nfrom making something wrong seem inoffensive or\nacceptable. The thing that is wrong is usually uncommon or far-fetched, so\npeople cannot sense any\nsort of immediate danger.\nTiming is essential, as a\njoke about controversial\nor serious issues, regardless\nof how inane or witty it is,\ncan harm people\u2019s sensitivities and become massive\nsocial conflicts. This can\nbe illustrated with jokes\nabout the 2001 terrorist\nattack on the Twin Towers.\nThe correct approach to\nmake fun of it would be to allow time for the psychological wounds to heal among the population, and\nthen elaborating jokes that remark on the unfairness\nof the tragedy or mocking the terrorists, without ever\nmentioning the victims.\nHumour does not necessarily mean being funny.\nAn intelligent association of two abstract or apparently unconnected elements can produce the same\neffect in a viewer as random eccentric videos of people\nstumbling or falling over. We find something amusing\nmainly due to confrontations between\nreality and fantasy, correctness and per-version. Humans love oxymorons, and\nthe more unexpected the connections,\nthe funnier they turn out.\nAnother common misconception\nis that laughter is synonymous with\nhumour. It is undeniable that humour\noften involves the trivialisation of reality.\nTherefore, although it can easily capture people\u2019s attention, humour should\nnot be used in \u201cserious\u201d matters, such\nas medicines for cancer treatment or\ngender-equality campaigns because it\ndistorts the meaning into something to\npoke fun at. However, laughter is more\ninvoluntary because\nit is physiologically\ncontrolled. The most\nimmediate example that springs\nto mind is one\u2019s reaction to being\ntickled, but in the book, the authors\ndescribe a more extreme case of\nlaughter, in which entire populations start chuckling uncontrollably\nfor no apparent reason. In the past,\nthis was associated with witches and\nthe Devil, but we currently know this phenomenon as\n\u2018collective hysteria\u2019. The example in The Humour Code\nfocuses particularly on the Tanganyika laughing disease of 1962. The \u201cpatient zero\u201d was a female student\nin a religious school who mysteriously began laughing\nin the middle of a class. The teacher took her out of\nthe class until she could pull herself together, but\nthe \u201cailment\u201d constantly reappeared, and eventually\nspread to other students. Therefore, the school decided to close its doors, but this only resulted in infecting\nthe families of the students, affecting thousands of\npeople. This so-called \u201cepidemic\u201d sent many people to\nhospital and caused many schools and businesses to\nshut down. What was the root cause of all this? Well,\nthe female student was under constant pressure and\nstress due to living and studying in a place with barely\nany contact with the outside world. In such an oppressive environment, the body needs to find a way to\nrelieve itself, and laughing is effective because it promotes our brains to secrete dopamine, the hormone\nof happiness. Therefore, laughing can be a sign that a\nsituation is not okay; a despairing call for help.\nThere are many other interesting concepts that the\nauthors cover, such as the study of humour to learn\nabout a particular culture, or the connection between\nhumour and natural selection. Overall, I would consider this a pleasant read, with a lot of absurd anec-dotes, like having a clown company in the middle of\nthe Amazon, and, of course, lots of humour!\nWangxing Guo Staff Writer\n\u201c\nANOTHER COMMON\nMISCONCEPTION IS\nTHAT LAUGHTER IS\nSYNONYMOUS WITH\nHUMOUR\nSection Editor\u2019s Note: We could all use a bit of humour to relieve us of the\nJanuary back-to-uni blues. One of our writers reviews \u2018The Humour Code\u2019\n- have a read of the book for a healthy dose of fun, and you might just learn\nsomething new about laughter along the way!\n\n"

Exactly.\njust forgot to go back to it. Luckily enough I did, and\nman, is Hex just a treat to listen to. I\u2019ve talked about\nthe history behind albums and their influence, but this\ntime I thought I\u2019d take a step back and just say, hey, this\nis a really nice album.\nThe bass feels like it takes a lead in the songs on this\nalbum a lot of the time. It\u2019s like a second melody that\naccompaniesthesoftairysingingfromvocalistGraham\nSutton, or the tinkling on the piano above it, weaving\nin and out of one another in some kind of dance. In\n\u201cA Street Scene\u201d the soft reverberating guitar provides a\ndrone for the rest of the\ntrack to build around.\nThe chorus is vibrantly\ndifferent from the\ndown-low and subtle\nverses, drums loud and\nsynths buzzing either\nside of your head.\nSutton\u2019s lyrics remind\nme somewhat of the\nmore abstract and\npoetic musings of Mark\nHollis on the later Talk\nTalk records.\nThe next track,\n\u201cAbsent Friend\u201d builds\naround the bass and lead guitar riff, the whole\nthing feeling sort of jazzy within the context of\narocksong.Whereitstartsoffquitetraditional,\nas the track progresses it feels more airy and\nethereal as the bass disappears, leaving synths\nand piano to play over and around the lead\nguitar.\u201cBigShot\u201dmeanwhiledoesawaywiththe\nmore traditional sound that has stuck around\nso far, feeling distinctly alien in the context of a\nrock song. The drone here is played on the bass,\nand it\u2019s almost hypnotic with the drums around\nit. The rest of the cacophony of synths and\npercussion weaves around it, detached from\nthe order of the bass and rhythm. The break\nmidway through is a shock after this, in the best\nkind of way, and leads eventually back to where\nthe song started.\nWhere this album really\nshines is the final track, though.\n\u201cPendulum Man\u201d feels like the natural precursor to\npost-rock that this album is nowadays heralded as.\nThere aren\u2019t any lyrics and the soundscapes take lead\nposition here. Starting off with a simple two-note\nguitar riff that\u2019s soon joined with an e-piano and a\nsynth, it evolves and changes through the song. It\u2019s the\ndefinition of a slow burn track, that shifts around and\nplaysexperimentallywiththeusualstructureofmodern\nmusic. The soundscapes halfway through remind me\nof some from Laughing Stock, my favourite Talk Talk\nalbum, with shimmering synths and an organ taking\ncentre stage. Sutton\u2019s guitar and Daniel Gish\u2019s keys lead\nthe song out quietly and almost tentatively.\nHex is definitely one of those albums I can\nwholeheartedly say is a hidden gem, an unlikely\nmasterpiece that I go back to all too often to just lose\nmyself in. It\u2019s just really, really good.\nIremember wondering\none day if the wonder\nthat is the Internet\nhad a possible list\nof all the genres\nin the world. I had\nrecently discovered how small\nmy niche in the\nworld of music\nwas and it was a\nbit jarring that there was\nmuch to explore. When\nI found everynoise.com,\nI wasn\u2019t sure what I was\nseeing. It\u2019s a spatially ar-rangedlistofeverygen-re Spotify has recorded\n- all the way from Latin tech\nhouse(whichisapparentlythe\nmost electronic genre it has to\noffer) to Polish classical music\n(which is the polar opposite).\nEvery Noise at Once, the\nname of the website, algorithmi-cally arranges all the music on Spotify into this enormous map.

    "content": "FRIDAY 14TH JANUARY 2022\n5\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nLiving beings live and die, mountains\nare destroyed and created\u2026but one\nconstant since the formation of Earth\nis its orbit around the Sun, which determines day and night. This constant\nmotion determines environmental conditions such as temperature and light\nthat are vital for the survival of living be-ings. Therefore, millions of years of evolution and natural selection has resulted\nin refined mechanisms to determine the\nproper time to exert a particular activity\nin living beings, depending on the time\nof day. These mechanisms are called circadian rhythms. The general public is\nfamiliar with one particular circadian\nrhythm: the sleep cycle. However, the\nawareness of the presence of an \u201cinternal\nclock\u201d in plants is not that well known\ndespite its relevance for the survival of\nour green fellows.\nCircadian rhythms determine the\nphysiological and behavioural changes\nof living beings in a fixed period, normally around 24 hours. They are the internal clock of living organisms. Timing\nin nature is essential for the survival of\nliving beings because it saves resources\nand maximises positive outcomes. The\nwrong timing can be deadly. For exam-ple, have you ever thought about what\nwould happen to a plant that accidentally produces flowers in winter?\nFlowers are designed to attract insects\ntopollinatethemandscattertheirpollen\nto other flowers, having a reproductive\nfunction. Because pollinators like bees\nare inactive in winter, this plant would\nbe wasting its nutrients on flowers that\nwould not be pollinized. However, the\nworst part is the plant needs to activate\nits metabolism to produce flowers. Now,\nhigher metabolism needs more light and\nnutritional requirements, but unfortu-nately, winter is the season with the least\nlight and food available, dooming the\nplant to a frost death.\nZeitgeber is the word used to define\nany external environmental factor such\nas light or temperature that encourages the 24-hour internal clocks of living\nbeings. The mechanism behind circadian clocks is based on\nthe chain effect. The\ntrigger of specific\nmolecules, normally\nproteins, are called\nbiologicalclocksthat\nreact to these zeitge-bers. The biological\nclock can change\nanother molecule,\nwhich may interact\nwith a cell organelle,\nwhich drives a physiological change in\nthe whole cell and then in tissue, etc.\nUsually, the biological clocks are regulated by the products they generate: the\nmore product you generate, the more\ninhibition the biological clock suffers.\nThis is called a negative feedback loop.\nIt is extremely convenient because the\nsystem regulates itself to reduce the consumption of matter/energy.\nThe responses of plants to zeitgebers\nare slow, so the plants need to \u201cpredict\u201d\nthe environmental changes beforehand\nto take the necessary actions to reach\nthat environmental change in the most\noptimal condition possible. For exam-ple, non-perennial plants start shedding\ntheir leaves at the beginning of autumn,\nso that their photosynthetic activity is\ncompletely shut down when winter ar-rives, allowing them to survive this harsh\nseason in a dormant stage. These plants\nhad to detect slight drops in the humid-ity, temperature and light to find the\nexact right moment to shed their leaves.\nIt is amazing how plants are more active\nthan they seem at first glance!\nPhotosystems are molecular complexes that absorb light in photosynthesis.\nPlans have to activate their photosys-tems during the day and deactivate them\nat night in order to conserve nutrients.\nThis is regulated by the conveniently\nnamed \u2018morning\u2019 and \u2018evening\u2019 genes.\nThe expression of morning genes depends on transcription factors in nuclei,\ncalled CCA1 and LHY, whose activity increases with increased intensity of\nsunlight. A transcription factor\ncontrols the RNA\nsynthesis from a\ntemplate DNA\nsequence. The\nRNA is then used\nto synthesise pro-teins, which are\nthemoleculesthat\nexpress the genes\ncontained in the\nDNA. CCA1/\nLHY inhibit the\nTOC1 gene, which activates the expression of CCA1/LHY genes. Therefore,\nthe concentrations of CCA1/LHY\nstart decreasing throughout the day. At\nnight, CCA1/LHY will have practically disappeared from the plant system.\nThen, evening genes appear in the scene.\nThese are regulated by the Evening\nComplex (EC) and\nformed by 3 pro-teins: LUX, ELF3\nand ELF4. The absence of CCA1/\nLHY permits again\nthe expression of\nthe TOC1 gene,\nactivating the transcription of CCA1/\nLHY genes, and\nhence the cycle begins again. As you\ncan see, the changes\nin the levels of light\nand temperature ac-tivatemorethanone\nbiological clock.\nOne last key ex-ampleinvolvesplant\nstomata. Plants\nrhythmically open\ntheir stomata to\nallow the essential\nexchange of O2\nand\nCO2\nwith the environment. However,\nthe opening of stomata causes plants to\nlose water through transpiration. In very\nhot and dry biomes like a desert, futile\nwater loss is deadly. Therefore, desert\nplants like cacti devised a strategy in\nwhich they only open their stomata to\nuptake and store as much CO2\nas possible at night, when the temperatures\nare low enough to avoid transpiration.\nAs they have accumulated enough CO2\nfor photosynthesis, they do not need to\nopentheirstomataduringtheday.When\nstomata open and close is determined by\nbiological clocks which respond to day-light. Circadian rhythms are the mechanisms used by living beings to guarantee\nthat their different metabolic reactions\nare executed at the right moment and\nfor the right duration, because correct\ntiming is key for survival.\nWang Guo Science Writer\nNature, not Human, was the inventor of clocks\nThe internal clock of plants (and all living beings)\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia - Dominicus Johannes Bergsma\nPLANTS NEED\nTO \u201cPREDICT\u201d\nENVIRONMENTAL\nCHANGES\nBEFOREHAND\n\u201c\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\n\n"

    "content": "After a brief Covid-induced hiatus, Force Majeure\nopened at the Donmar Warehouse this week.\nBased on the Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s 2014 tragicomedy film\nof the same name, one wonders why a stage adaption is\nnecessary when the original film (1) received critically acclaim (winning the Jury prize at the Cannes Film\nFestival), (2) was made very recently, and (3) is readily\navailable to watch on streaming services. If I wanted to,\nI could watch the original right now. So why should I\nsit shoulder to shoulder with strangers in the less than\nspacious theatre and potentially risk catching Covid to\nwatch the same thing? Stage adaptions of films need to\nbring something new to the table if they want to justify their existence. Michael Longhurst\u2019s production of\nTim Price\u2019s adaptation of the film did not achieve this.\nRory Kinnear\u2019s Tomas is a dopey middle aged oik:\nslightly useless at everything, a little bit of a wet towel,\nand just trying to enjoy his family holiday. However,\nthe play seems to have it in for him, taking every opportunity to humiliate and degrade him after he panics\nin a moment of danger. As a potential avalanche draws\nnearer to Tomas and his nice middle-class family; he\nruns away instead of protecting them. Is this an Arthur Miller inspired Tragedy of the Common Man? No.\nMy dad is also middle aged and also slightly useless at\neverything. But like Tomas he works hard at a job he\nprobably doesn\u2019t like to provide for his children. He\ndoesn\u2019t deserve to be torn apart on stage in the name\nof deconstructing masculinity for the sake of it. The\nproduction veers on the nasty side, something exacerbated by the lack of clear purpose. It is never clear what\nthe writer or director\u2019s take on the issue is other than\n\u201csome men are a bit dopey\u201d. Is Tomas sympathetic? Or\ndoes he deserve to be forsaken by the family he works\nso hard to support?\nRoryKinnearandLyndseyMarshalashisconstantly\ndisgruntled wife Ebba do well to bring out the combative side of their deteriorating relationship. But that\u2019s all\nthey can do. They are never given moments of tender-nessoraffectionasacouple.Allweseeisunspokenten-sion. Consequently, their marriage is never believable.\nAfter all, there must be a reason why Ebba has stuck\nwith Tomas; how she has not divorced him by now is\na mystery. But perhaps their chemistry is an issue that\nwill be ironed out with time. The cast did have a gap in\nperformances due to having to isolate.\nBut Covid was not the only uphill struggle. Tilted at\na steep angle, actors had to clamber up and down the\nski slope inspired stage. This off-piste creative decision\nthat did not pay off as it made navigating the stage dif-ficult. Confined to awkward clambering, actors could\nnot move freely to explore their characters\u2019 physicali-ty. One wonders if a flat stage would have changed the\nfabric of their performances and made the production\nmore engaging. There was also an anxiety inducing\nsense of \u201coh god, that is going to fall over\u201d whenever an\nitemofsetwasbroughtonandbalancedontheslopeat\nan angle.

On the other\nhand, there were some parts where humour did seem\nappropriate. One comedic triumph was the nun, Sister\nFenella (Dearbhla Malloy), who brought a light-heart-ed touch to the production with jibes in playful Irish\ntones, such as her comments about the fact that Lord\nAsriel should have \u201ckept it in his trousers\u201d.\nInthisshow,IbelievethatapartofthemagicofPullman\u2019s universe is lost in attempting to translate events\nto be more \u2018modern\u2019, since Lyra\u2019s world (even as a baby)\nis inherently classical, carrying with it the charm of a\nbygone Oxford. Although I did like the way that many\nof the characters were portrayed in this more contemporary context, I felt Mrs Coulter (Ayesha Dharker)\nto be a little too much of a headmistress. She comes\nacross as totally unfeeling. Her conflicted love for Lyra\nwas glazed over and she falls a little too comfortably\ninto the category of staple evil villain. Samuel Creasey\nsuccessfully paints a realistic picture of Malcolm Polstead, the slightly shy, intelligent boy who experiences\nthings just beyond the horizon of his understanding.\nAlthough maybe he is portrayed as a little too much\nof a know-it-all in a play for laughs. Alongside him,\nAlice Parslow, a rough and ready London girl is given\nlife through an outstanding performance by Ella Dacres. The dynamic between the two on stage is a joy to\nwatch.\nIt is inevitable that not every detail of the novel can,\nor even should, be perfectly conveyed in a production,\nand indeed there were a great many good ideas in this\nadaptation. Overall, this was a visually stunning and\nentertaining translation of Pullman\u2019s original work;\nbut the adaption might not be to everyone\u2019s taste.\nFRIDAY 14TH JANUARY 2022\n8\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSamuel Creasey features as Malcolm Polstead in Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage at the Bridge Theatre.\nCredits: Photo/ Manuel Harlan\nWith a deep respect for history woven into the\nfabric of the production, the revival of Daniele Abbado\u2019s 2013 production of Verdi\u2019s Nabucco is a\npoignant take on the opera that addresses themes of\nexile, freedom, and religion.\nSet during the destruction of the first temple in Jerusalem in 586 BC by the real-life Nebuchadnezzar\nII, Nabucco mixes a destructive family power struggle\nagainst the backdrop of the exile of the Jewish people\nfrom their homeland. This backdrop that is the most\ncelebrated part of Verdi\u2019s opera. Premiering in 1842,\nthe famed \u201cVa, pensiero, sull\u2019ali dorate\u201d (referred to as\nThe Chorus of The Hebrew Slaves) was recognised by\nItalians as a call for self-determination at a time when\nMilan was under Austrian rule and is the most enduring part of the opera. Sung by a large chorus huddled\ncentre stage, their delicate collective vocal control captured both the desperate frenzy and tragic despair of\na culture exiled from their homeland. This is made all\nthemorepoignantbytheechoingofthereal-lifesuffer-ing of the Jewish people during the Second World War.\nWith the chorus dressed to invoke 1940s immigrants,\nsome even wearing kippahs (traditional skullcap for\nobservant Jewish men), and Alison Chitty\u2019s eerie set\nconsisting of grey concrete slabs mirroring the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, Abbado\ngrounds the heightened plot of Verdi\u2019s opera in a harsh\nreality. It is easy to see why Verdi was dubbed \u201cpapa dei\ncori\u201d by the Milanese public.\nA powerful Amartuvshin Enkhbat portrays the\neponymous king as a hubristic a mafia boss. His booming baritone commands the stage and dominates the\nchorus who cower in his presence. But Enkhbat\u2019s performance is multifaceted. He is also able to convey\nvulnerability and despair after the Babylonian king\u2019s\ndownfall before valour and heroism during his eventual redemption. The high priest Zaccaria, played by\nAlexander Vinogradov, also captured vulnerability as\nthe leader of the Jewish people tasked with maintain\nhope in the face of destruction. Wrapped in his tallit\n(a Jewish prayer shawl) his characterisation again hinted at the real-life desperation of those oppressed by the\nNazis.\nThe question of performing Jewishness on stage\nhas come into the limelight this year. Multiple shows\nin have tackled explicitly Jewish themes (notably Tom\nStoppard\u2019s Leopoldstadt, Paula Vogel\u2019s Indecent, and\nCordelia Lynn\u2019s Other Acts of Violence). Some have not\naddressed Jewish themes, but have highlighted the importance of conversations about Anti-Semitism in theatre (I\u2019m thinking of Al Smith\u2019s Rare Earth Mettle at\nthe Royal Court). If this production of Nabucco teach-esusanythingitishowcreativesneedadeeprespectfor\nhistory when addressing Jewishness on stage. Abbado\ndoes exactly this. The end result is a potent meditation\non freedom and culture set to Verdi\u2019s timeless music.\nOn Golden Wings\nWhere? The Royal Opera House\nWhen? Until 23rd January 2022\nHowmuch?

Everyone has their defects\nbecause certain external factors influence our life such as genetics or tragic\naccidents. When people realised that\nby sharing a misleadingly \u2018perfect\u2019 lifestyle they were advocating a practically\nunachievable model, they decided to\nchange the status quo to a friendlier one\nwhich is the one we have currently. Now,\nfailing is fine, the world is cruel and just\ntrying your best is good enough. Everyone should applaud you for your efforts\nand the ones that criticise the causes of\nyour failure are savages that do not how\nto behave in this society.\nSuccess at an early stage is not always\na good sign. It could mean that the activity engaged in is easy, not requiring high\nexpertise or a lot of effort, so it is not valuable because anyone else could do it. A\nclear example of this is video games, one\nof their main appealing traits is the ease\nto gain recognition and instant gratifica-tionofdoingsomethingwell.Thusemit-ting a torrent of endorphins that hijack\nour brain. The fact that it is so easy to\nfeel successful while playing video games\ncan increase the risk of neglecting reality in favour of the virtual world because\ntrue success requires time and work. Additionally, there is no guarantee of success in the real world, video games are\ndesigned to instill the feeling of uniqueness and geniality, whereas in the real\nworld they are mostly average because\nthey are basically wasting their time in\nsomething unreal. This mechanism of\nvideo games to create people addicted to\nnon-real but gratifying success is unfortunately widespread in our society. It can\nbeseeninfootballspectatorshiporsocial\nmedia. These effortless activities give us\nadoseofdopaminethatisenoughtofeel\ngood, but not enough to satisfy us total-ly, so we always go back to the source of\nthe problem believing it is the solution.\nTherefore, early success might be a synonym of the instant gratification trap.\nHowever, what if the activity is actually something difficult and valuable?\nThen, the more plausible explanation\nfor the initial success would be a natural talent, which is, in my opinion, a\ndouble-edged sword. Of course, natural\ntalent increases the learning progression\nand the success rate, but it could paradoxically do the\ncontrary. When\ntalented people\nfind out they are\ncontinually suc-ceeding, two tendencies are usually developed.\nFirst,theassumption of being the\nmost skilled person in that activity as this is constantly supported\nby the results.\nThis can derive\ninto a false sensation of immo-bilism, that this\nwinning stage\nwill elongate over\ntime and there is\nno need for the\nperson to work\nhard in order to\nkeep up with the learning progression,\nmaking people lazier and conformist because they feel there are no others better\nthan them. Second, the neglect of reality\nis closely related to the idea of the last\nsentence. Regardless of the natural tal-ent, when people are starting something,\nthey would rarely compete against the\nbest people already in that activity, instead they compete against other nov-ices. Therefore, the relative competition\nis beneficial for the talented person, not\nthe absolute competition. Now, because\nthe talented person is in a conservative\nattitude in terms\nof results ob-tained, and they\nwant to keep\nsucceeding, this\nwill cause a risk-averse mentality\nthat will prevent\nthe talented person from competing with people better than\nthem \u2013 as they\nmay potentially\nlose, thus falling\ninto stagnation\njust as the trap\nof instant gratifi-cation; pursuing\nthe pleasure of\nwinning and not\nof improving.\nThere are two\nmain reasons\nto justify why\npeople are reluctant to fail. The fear of\nrejection is well instilled in our genes,\npeople tend to believe that failing will\ncause the society to contempt them as\ninferior beings, that they will lose the\nrespect of their fellows, even though\nthis is not true. We do not wish to show\nour defeats because it seems that we are\nweak. Therefore, engaging in low-risk or\nsocially acceptable activities has become\nthenorminmostpopulationsnowadays.\nAnother reason is that failing requires a\nminimum amount of effort to exit the\ncomfort zone and engage in something\nnew and challenging. In a world that\nadvocates for the state of maximum\ncomfort, there is a lot of friction to do\nsomething out of our comfort zone.\nThe reaction against failure can be\nproactive, by identifying the causes of\nthefailureandtakingactionsubsequent-ly, or not proactive by simple negligence\nthrough excuses and procrastination.\nThe problem with the first option is that\nit requires acceptance of the crude reality of hard work and patience; whereas\nthe second one is fast, cheap, and com-fortable. People are lazy by nature, so\nguess which one they tend to choose.\nHow does one combat the fear of fail-ure? One word: acceptance. You need to\naccept two facts: you will die, and there\nis always a bigger fish. On the one hand,\nlife is very short and you should not live\naccording to the expectations of others\nbecause we do not live in the Stone Age,\nso the rejection of the group is not deadly anymore. Additionally, note that after\ndeath, you will not care anymore about\nmortgages, careers, etc. On the other\nhand, regardless of how hard-working\nand talented you are, you will not be\nthe best in all the situations, even if you\njust specialise in a specific field. However, this should not be alarming as we\nlive in a world with more opportunities\nthan ever in human history thanks to\nthe rise of living standards and globali-sation. As well as the competition becoming international, the opportunities\nare too. Besides, the success of others\ncan be used as a source of inspiration;\nand note that successful people might\nbe potential high-quality partners. In\na paradoxical world where mediocrity\nand competition are coexisting in har-mony, be like the Blacksmith; most of\nthe hammer blows will not be perfect\nbut the difference is that each blow is\nmodified according to the outcome of\nthe previous one, polishing impurities.\nFinally, due to perseverance and using\nfeedback correctly, a fine sword is forged\nto slash the armour of ego and conform-itywearealltrappedin,myselfincluded.\nBe like the Blacksmith...\nPhoto credits: Wiki Images\nTHE REACTION\nAGAINST FAILURE\nCAN BE PROACTIVE,\nBY IDENTIFYING\nTHE CAUSES OF\nTHE FAILURE AND\nTAKING ACTION\nSUBSEQUENTLY, OR\nNOT PROACTIVE BY\nSIMPLE NEGLIGENCE\nTHROUGH\nEXCUSES AND\nPROCRASTINATION\n\u201c\n\n"

Let\u2019s look at some common\nconcerns about adopting a plant-based diet.\nHealth\nWe were taught food pyramids or wheels at school,\nwhere meat and dairy are \u2018required\u2019 to be healthy. But\nnow numerous studies have shown that plant-based diets provide all the nutrients required for a healthy diet.\nIt does require some more thought at first, as simply\ncutting out meat and dairy will leave you lacking certain things. Vitamins, such as B12, are a common supplement in a plant-based diet; I get my B12 from fortified oat milk and Marmite. All the proteins you can get\nfrom beans, pulses, lentils, nuts, or legumes, can have a\ncarbon footprint 50 times lower than from a beef burg-er.Thesefoodscontainplentyofirontoo,asdoesspin-ach and broccoli, which contain non-heme iron. (90%\nof our body\u2019s iron stores consists of non-heme iron.)\nThe WHO have classified processed meats as Class 1\ncarcinogens , the same group as smoking, contributing\nto bowel and stomach cancers. Overconsumption of\nantibioticshasledtoresistancebacteriasuchasMRSA.\nMore expensive\nIt can be true that organically grown plant-based foods\nare more expensive than cheap meats. But this is partly due to the UK government allowing meat and dairy\nto be sold at 0% VAT. Plant-based foods are sold with\nVAT, making them 20% more expensive. Meat and\ndairy are therefore artificially cheap. Billions of pounds\nof public money is spent to subsidise meat and dairy,\nwhen it could be spent to make organic plant-based\nfoods cheaper instead. Let\u2019s campaign for this.\nFarmers would lose their jobs\nThere are more than 11,000 dairy farmers and 23,600\nbeefandlambproducersintheUK.Reducingdemand\nfor meat and dairy would put these farmers out of busi-ness, surely? Not if they are offered grants from the\ngovernment to change their farms into more sustainable and environmentally friendly ecosystems. A UK\nscheme is currently in place, but it currently pays the\nlargest landowners disproportionately highly, meaning\nsmaller farmers don\u2019t benefit enough to rewild their\nland. A fairer scheme would be expensive, but a lot\ncheaper than continually and unsustainably repairing\nthe country from the horrors of climate change and\necological collapse. Farmers need to be paid fairly to\nallow nature to flourish and to reduce their emissions.\nFreedom of choice\nEveryone wants to make their own choices. This is\nwhat makes us human and what makes us happy. The\nlast thing people want is to be told what they can eat.\nI made the choice to stop eating meat and dairy after I\nlearnt about the disastrous effects it has on our crumbling environment and the inhumane conditions that\nanimals suffer. It was not an easy decision to watch\nfootage of the inside of abattoirs or dairy farms, but it\nwas all a part of my education. I was still free to make\nmy choice, but my choice changed when I learnt more\nabout the topic.\nMeat and daily taste nice\nIlovethetasteofbacon,burgers,milkshakes,omelettes,\nand steaks. But knowing the true cost of these foods\nwas important to me in making my decision on whether I ate them or not. I also found that I could cook \u2018tastier\u2019 food with spices and techniques that I had never\nlearnt before. Online videos have helped me to learn a\nnew skill. I love cooking now. My parents bought me a\nplant-based cookery course for Christmas!\nOverall, I wanted to contribute this article to share the\nissues around meat and dairy that made an enormous\nimpact on me. Adopting a plant-based diet has made\nme happier and healthier, and it\u2019s one of the most im-pactful actions I have been able to take in tackling the\nclimate and ecological emergency. Today, the average\nUK citizen eats 20% less meat than in 2008 , and this\nis an encouraging trajectory. My parents said after their\nfirst plant-based Christmas \u2018this food tastes so good\nthat I don\u2019t see the point of eating meat anymore\u2019. It has\nbeen a positive journey for all of us.\nCheck out the carbon fotprint of your favourite protein\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nFOOD\nImage Credits: CC-BY Joseph Poore & Hannah Ritchie\nSwitching to a fully plant-based diet could\nreduce food\u2019s global impacts by:\n\u2022 76% for land use\n\u2022 49% for greenhouse gas emissions\n\u2022 50% for acidification\n\u2022 49% for eutrophication\n\u2022 19% for scarcity-weighted freshwater\nwithdrawals\n\n"

Escaping from a Bad\nTime, Vol. 2 ends the band\u2019s 2 year long silence since\nVolume 1 was released in early 2020. The new 5-song\nEP is everything that made me initially love the band\nat secondary: the catchy danceability of the upbeat\ntracks, paired with new collaborations with other\nartists like New Zealand duo BROODS and Voice\nUK winner Ruti. These features add new angles\nthat the Bristol group couldn\u2019t do alone. Callum\nMerrett, one half of the band (the other being his\nbrother Ewan), said \u201cwe always dreamed it would be\na collaborative project\u201d, and it truly is with Arlo Parks\nco-writing and producing \u2018Bluish\u2019 with the brothers.\nFor me, the standout song\non the EP is \u201cAngie\u201d. Closing\nthe EP in a wonderfully\nmuted, conversational way,\nthe final track embodies the\nsomewhat lonely last two\nyears. The stripped back\nsong for Bad Sounds is still\nladen with floating synths,\nbeautifully compressed- to-oblivion drums and ethereal\nvocals mixing to form a ghostly\nchoir at the end of the track.\nAll these components congregate perfectly, never\nsounding too busy even on the larger songs, \u201cYou\nMove Backwards\u201d and \u201cGravity Love\u201d. Ruti\u2019s vocals\nenhance the aforementioned \u201cYou Move Backwards\u201d,\nbringing the almost-disco backing track into the arena\nof modern pop.\t\t\t\nThis genre defiance echoes through Bad Sounds\u2019\nentire discography.

I had a secret garden\nparty that weekend too!\u201d.\n\u201cThe ministerial code is cringe anyway\u201d commented\nDevon from, um, Devon.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want Brexit and still don\u2019t\u201d sighed\nAnton from Milton Keynes, \u201cbut he\u2019s such a goofy\nfella!\u201d. Anton then went on to attempt an impression of\nthe PM so poor that we haven\u2019t even bothered trying to\nrecreate it in text.\n\u201cHe just like me fr\u201d Tweeted Humphrey Macintosh\nYaxley of Surrey.\n\u201cI\u2019m just sick of these young, woke snowflake twats\nengaging in culture wars, which to be clear I never\ndo\u201d said Darren in Harrogate. \u201cI want to rise above the\nleft-right divide, but the liberal dick holes keep pulling\ndown the statues most important to me\u201d.\n\u201cI myself am very impartial\u201d said Arnold Jacobs,\nProfessor of Politics at UCL. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life\nstudying politics for what it is and keeping away from\npartisanship and the left and right of the spectrum.\nSince Boris has basically never stuck to anything he\u2019s\never said and clearly has no political morals, he is the\nperfect candidate for me to get behind\u201d.\nEASY SOLUTION TO THE\nPESKY SLEEP PROBLEM\nWHEN REVISING FOR EXAMS\nThe new brain add-on from PorpoiseLabs\nInc lets you sleep each half of your brain\nseparately, meaning you never need to stop\nlearning the stuff you\u2019ll never use again after\ntwo weeks\u2019 time.\nNot yet tested on humans\nSide effects may (we have no idea) include:\nMood swings\nParalysis of half the body\nInsatiable urge for tuna\nN95 MASK WITH A GAG BALL\nATTACHED TO THE INSIDE\nNow you can keep it kinky even with Plan B\non the go.\nHALF PRICE!!! 1/2\nFREE TATTOO - CALL 0207 594 8072\nFirst things first, I\u2019m not a tattoo artist, but I need to practice for the\nNintendo Cosplay 18+ club I\u2019ve joined.\nThe tattoo WILL be Mario trying to stuff Yoshi into Koopa Trooper\u2019s\nshell whilst on Rainbow Road. You CANNOT ask why. This is NONNEGOTIABLE.\nAlso I accept no responsibility if it gets infected or whatever I\u2019m not a\ndoctor either.\nI look forward to your call.\n\n"
