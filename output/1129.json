    "content": "22 Music 7 December 1998\noma Records\nbased in Glasgow\nhave consistently\nchallenged and inspired\nc lubbers and music listeners alike with their cutting\nedge sounds. Sometimes hard and driving, sometimes delicious and funky, but never boring, Soma has\nnurtured and put its artists on thc world stage. They\nhave also pioneered some previously unheard of concepts in dance music. One is that they encourage\ntheir artists to release full-length albums to prove\nthem as mature musicians. The other is that they are\ngetting their artists to make live shows and break\ndown the stereotype that live el c tronic music is bor-ing. Soma has long been known as a family of like-minded individuals driven by a common\npassion. We caught up with tn voy, one\nof their artists. His new album (Where\nThere's Life is out now).\nWho are you? What do you do with\nmusic?\nI am Hope Grant, aka Envoy. I 've done\nfour eps for Soma which stretch back over\nthe last four years, and I 've just completed\nmy debut album Where There's Life. We're\ndoing live- dates across the country and it's S all looking quite positive!\nHave you only recorded for Soma? r:j No. Ihe first thing I did was for a label\ncalled Peacefrog. I did that under the\nname St Vitus Dance, lh at was the first\nthing I did alone. Then Soma approached\nme a little while after that, and I hooked .\nup with them. They're like a family,- a great\nbunch of guys. I 've been recording for\nthem since. I also did some stuff lor a label\ncalled Plink Plonk, under the name Urban\nGroove.\nSo I guess Soma approached you on\nthe strength of the Peacefrog material,\nbecause that's a very famous ep.\nYes. tor a first ep it got a really good\nreaction. Lots of people were aware of it. A good mate\nof mine knew the Soma guys and they'd heard the\nPeacefrog ep. They asked him if he reckoned I would\ndo some stuff for them. That's how the Envoy stuff came\nabout.\nWhy do you record under different names?\nI never actually meant to go onto Soma. What\nhappened was I did the St Vitus Dance cp and I was\nready to give the next ep to peace frog. But they were\nin a funny direction at the time. They were doing a lot\nof Chicago style house, and they already had a techno\nblueprint with Dan Curtin and Luke Slater. Thc guy\nwho runs Peacefrog (Pete) thought the stuff was a bit\nsimilar. So what actually happened was Solitary Mission,\nwhich was the first Envoy release on Soma was actually meant to be the second St Vitus Dance release on\nPeacefrog.\nI don't really change my style a lot. I don't go\nunder a lot of different guises because it's usually all\nthe same kind of sound. It's just that people want you\nto change your name and I just fell into line really!\nCan you describe this sound? What kind of music\ndo you make?\nI like to think of it as beautiful stuff; emotive. I don't Artist Profile\nreally want to say timeless because that's a big word,\nbut if you take the St Vitus Dance, I can listen to it now\nand it still sounds fresh as if it was made yesterday. But\nit's a good few years old. So really the stuff I make is\nemotive and soulful.\nAs your music Is emotive, are you inspired to make\nmusic from emotional things that happen to you?\nYes. I 've seen some of the reviews of Where There's Life and some magazines have come in with thc slant\nthat it's a very deep and personal kind of album. When\nyou consider the word techno, a lot of people say\n\"urban decay\" and \"you've got to be really up against\nit to make this machine-style music\". I don't look at it\nlike that at all. I make techno after a lovely conversation with somebody, or a night out, or just talking to\npeople and having personal experiences. Life's about\nmore than just urban decay and our surroundings. It's also about emotions and people.\nHow did you originally get Involved In music?\nI was very young when I got into music. I started\nwriting songs when I was a kid. I wanted to be the\nproverbial rock/pop star. I was a singer/song writer\nand I wanted to be in bands throughout my childhood.\nThen I got into Prince. I saw a video, and I had never\nseen that kind of energy before. II really did blow mc\naway. I'm quite an obsessive person. When I get into\nsomething I have to delve deeper and find out all the\nstuff about it. When I delved into thc Prince stuff I found\nthat he writes all the songs, he plays the instruments,\nhe does the vocals; and that's what I wanted to do! I le's basically his own man.\nIt was around thc time when everyone was setting\nup their own studios, so I got a bank loan and bought\na drum kit and a four track and started writing songs\nall by myself. It was a good apprenticeship but you never\nknow what road your life is going to take. A friend of\nmine took me to a rave in 1987 and I never looked back.\nThe songwriter in me died. At first I thought, \"what is\nthis?\" I thought a303 was noise! \"Where's the melody?\nWhere's the harmony?\" But a few raves down the road\nI was hooked!\nSo which DJs were you listening to then?\nIn those days it was the times of the big raves with\nla bio and Groovcrider. Now these boys make\ndrum'n 'bass. There was also a guy called Frankie Valentine who blew me away. Also people like Colin Faver\nand LSD. Back then I used to follow them everywhere\nwhen they did Energy and the big raves. Then they used\nto come and play in tiny little after hours clubs and spin\ntill the morning. They would play everything. Now\nthey've all ventured off into their own genres.\nDo you feel that's a bit sad, as It was maybe more\ndiverse before?\nYes I do. The whole way it's gone now is\npretty sad to me, but I suppose it's just a sign\nof the times. Everytime I meet someone for\nthe first time and they ask me what sort of\nmusic I do, I always say house! We all know\nabout the \"t word\" (techno), and if you use the\n\"t word\" to some people they think, \"Oh my\nGod! You make that bang bang noise. It's great when people like you ts clf ate on missions to show people by playing them thc\nmusic they didn't expect to be thc \"t word\",\nand they actually like it! I 've got to the stage\nnow where I don't even bother because I don't think they'll understand, so I just say\nhouse. It's so b to ad.I think it's sad that I cop\nout but it's just a sign of the times.\nLive techno acts are often criticised for not\nbeing as raw or exciting as rock musicians on\nstage. How did your live sets come about?\nSoma had albums out las l year by Maas\nand Funk D 'Void. Both of them went out and\ndid live sets in Lurope. I followed them around\nto a few gigs to check what this live; Ihing was\nall about. Soma were always saying \"you\nshould go live when you do your album.\" I did-n't know about that. I saw Maas and Funk\nD 'Void do their thing and was very impressed.\nMy singer/songwriter background had never really left\nme, as I thought it would when I immersed myself into\ntechno. I decided I would try and do vocals while I was\nplaying live and see if people were up for it and what\ntype of reaction I would get. They were all my own\nvocals. Up until now the reaction has been very positive because there was that energy that you speak of\nin thc other scenes.\nPeople used to say to me that the crowd doesn't want lo be entertained and that the DJs are the kings.\nI don't like the fact that they have this power. I think\nit's great that they're spreading the word, but I 've been\ninto this scene a long time now and I 've seen a lot of\nDJs turn up, don't even look at the crowd, take the fee,\nplay the same set that they played in the last club, and\nthy're out of there onto the next club. I'm a fan, and\nI'm a paying fan. I believe that they should be entertaining the crowd. There are only a few that do that for\nme. I wanted the crowd to be entertained. I was told\nthat they didn't want to be entertained, that they just\nwanted the music. At this moment in time I don't think\nthis is the case.\nDo the live sets work?\nYes! It'swot king big style at the moment. Especially\n\n"

In\nthc quiet bits between experiments, perhaps. And do consider how\nscience appears in popular culture. It\nwill, after all, be in your interests to understand it, as your career may depend on\nyour ability to influence it. You'll learn lots\nof interesting things. Like how difficult it\nis to explain the simple ideas it has taken\nyou three or more years to grasp. It'll also\nshow you the things the public do know\nabout, and you may be surprised to find\nthat they arc not as ignorant as you\nmight have thought or perhaps hoped.\nPay some attention to the stereotypes of\nscientists and how these might be per-pet u a ted. If you land up writing popular\nscience we'll be looking to you as out\nunofficial PR exec. But what has this to\ndo with this book review?\nIt seems inconceivable but these\ntwo authors have pulled off a major\nachievement. They've written a popular\naccount of molecular biology. How often\ndo you see'popular' an\nthc same sentence? they spotted the\nhuge success of 'Jutassic Park' and its\nsequel 'The Lost World' and set about\nlinking the fictional science with the facts.\nCould it really happen? They are in a excellent position to act as guides. Lindley is a science writer and former physicist, and De Salle was responsible, in\n1992, for isolating the then oldest known\nfragment of DNA.\nThey write bright, lively and readable prose. Actually we can't build a dinos aut from the dinosaur blood contained within a fossil mosquito, but it was\nfun finding out exactly why not. Their\nstyle is distinctly Amctican but it's accessible and thc occasional ghastly Americanism doesn't get in the way too much.\nWhat DNA docs and whether any bits\nfrom 80 million years ago are preserved\nis described entertainingly, and the\nunlikelihood that (a) a mosquito preserved inside amber has eaten dinosaur\nblood and (b) this could be extracted is\nexplored. Laboratory work, so rarely\ndescribed, puts in a welcome appear-ance. The authors even turn up a sort of\n'hippie-drop-out-Nobel-prize-winner' who\ninvented the Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method for amplifying gene\nsequences, and used his prize to go\nsurfing and become a peripatetic scientific consultant.\nro1 communication other information\n-j f about scientists is also being com-muni cate d, albeit unintentionally.\nThc aut hots have come rather\ntoo dose to fulfilling one of\nhe popular scientist stereo-pes. In this case it's the obsessive party pooper s who will\nnot let a good story get in\nw the way of a fact.

I he\nlatter is simply incorrect and the former...\nwell - if you don't recognise thc problem\nyou too need to get out more\nLess importantly, the scientists also\nhave an intermittent\nproblem with the willing suspension of\ntheir disbelief. It lumbers up and down\nlike the Grand Old\nDuke of York and his\nmen. They arc occasionally distracted by\ntheir own attention to\ndetail. Sadly this\nshades into nerd in ess on a grand scale. For\nexample, one of the\nauthors ran his video\nof 'Jurassic Park' on\nslow motion (anorak on, I guess) and he\nwas able to jot down the supposed\ndinos aut DNA sequence displayed on a screen in thc dinosaur park visitor centre.\nI le trawled through a gene databank on\nthc Internet and within half an h out had\nfound it was from an E. coll bacterium.\nThe film crew seem to have been quite\ninventive in creating the appearance of\n\"We could do\nwithout the scientist's' I know I know l know\nplease please\nplease' like the\nschool swot\"\nauthenticity.

    "content": "2 News 7 December 1998\nSTA to be Superceeded\nThrough a variety of closed-door meetings and despite a number of financial\nquestions that remain unanswered, the\nCollege has chosen not to renew the\ncontract for STA Academic Travel. Instead\nthe shop, which is primarily aimed at\nstaff, has been awarded to a new com-p any, who will re-open with a new image\nin the new year.\nCrucially, the Union seems to have\nbeen given no say in the process, despite\nthe fact that it receives a large chunk of\nthe revenue that the tender generates.\nThis all stems from an arrangement\nformed last year, whereby the College\nforced the Union to share the income\ngenerated by the two travel agencies on\nthe Walkway (STA Academic & STA Student Travel) in lieu of the cost of the JCR\nrefurbishment. Although then President\nAndy Heeps offered, as a concession to\nthe Rector, a seemingly more logical deal\nBy David Roberts\nwhereby the College could take academic\ntravel income from the Union, allowing\nICU to keep student travel.. However,\nthis offer was refused, and a straight\n70/30 split was agreed. Consequently,\nthe Union retained the right to assist in\nthe tender process for both companies.\nWhen the tender for the student\ntravel shop went out last May, College (in\nthe form of the Estates Manager) argued\nthat the Union couldn't possibly tender\nproperly, and refused to meet the sab-bat ical s, on the grounds that \"they're only\nstudents\". Thus, the Union Manager was\nasked to deal with the tender process,\nand secured a very valuable deal for the\nUnion. In the summer, however, the\nUnion learnt that College had put the academic travel shop out to tender, without\nconsultation. Mr Heeps demanded that\nthe Union reserved the right of veto, on\nthe grounds they had a financial interest.\nThe Union Manager was once again\nasked to sit on the selection panel. Yet the\ncommittee did not contact her about\nmeetings until the last minute, and then\ndid not allow her to ask questions or see\nany of the financial paperwork. I his attitude has profoundly affected Mr I lee ps:\"I am.ashamed to think that I respected\nmembers of College staff last year. Most\nhave shown themselves to be two-faced\nand no better than schoolchildren, lying\nto the student body in the short term to\nget their own way\".\nEventually, a new firm was picked to\nrun the agency, with the result that STA\nAcademic Travel on the Walkway will\nclose down on December 18, with the\nnew outlet opening in time for the new\nyear.\nKEEP lilt.

The university has\nstrong links with Imperial College, which\nprovides academic support. This follows\nImperial's existing links with Mahanakorn\nUniversity where staff from IC direct postgraduate courses (as well as setting and\nmarking examination papers) of the\nsame standard and quality as Imperial's own.\nAsian UST aims to be a leading\nregional science and technology training\ncentre and conducts all of its teaching in\nEnglish. The University, which is a private\none. is entirely Thai-owned and is based\nin Jomtien in the eastern seaboard\nregion, between the popular tourist destination Pattaya and the city of Rayong,\nabout seventy-five miles south-east of\nthe capital Bangkok. Asian UST runs\ndegree programmes in Engineering\n(Civil, Llectrical & Electronic, Industrial &\nManufacturing, mechanical and Software Engineering & Information Systems), Applied Science (Applied\nChemistry, Biochemistry and BiotechBy Sunil Rao no logy) and in Business Management\nleading to BEng, BSc and BBA degrees\nrespectively. Masters' degrees are also\nconferred.\nWith nearly seventy-five percent of\nacademic staff being expatriates and the\nuniversity's curriculum being based on\nand closely following that of IC (with the\nsuccessful tutorial model being adopted\nas well), Asian UST promises to usher in\na new infusion of science and technology training to Thailand. The University,\nwhich has just taken in its first batch of\nnearly 500 students, offers students, who\nhave been forced to reconsider plans to\ncome to the UK, a new chance to get a world-class degree of the same standard and quality as an Imperial degree.\n\"We think the university will be good for\nThailand and the whole region,\" says Dr\nPinai Sukhawarn, a member of Asian\nUST's Liaison Committee who added that\nin addition to following IC's curriculum,\nthe university had chosen to model their\nteaching on the effective and efficient\nteaching styles and methodologies currently in place here al Imperial, with the\nemphasis on tutorials.\ncom peres, one of whom was te lix' s own\nMilen - Tha Bomb columnist.

Oh yes, that winter cold is\nhere. What we need, I hear you cry, is\nthe sound of summer. A j ingly jan gly happy-to-bc-alive feeling that will clear\nthe congested conduits of our souls.\nWell hooray then, because here come\nDodgy!\nFormed in Hounslow ten years ago,\nDodgy originally comprised of just vocalist Nigel Clark and drummer and 'pro-fess ional lig ger' Matthew priest. Guitarist\nAndy Miller joined a couple of years\nlater. They released a few singles on\nindependent labels before signing to\nA&M in 1993. Mercifully, only one single\nfrom these early days is included here,\nthe album closer The Elephant, displaying that Dodgy were yet to find their\nsound. The next 4 years gave us three\nDodgy albums, the lazily titled The Dodgy\nAlbum, followed by the better known\nHomegrown and the platinum success\nof Free Peace Sweet. We are treated to\ntwelve 'Ace A's' from these albums plus\ntheir last single before Nigel Clark\njumped ship, Every Single Day. This\nleaves us with three 'Killer B's' that are\nso lifeless they are incapable of throwing\na punch let alone killing.\nSo, let's have a look at the singles\nthen. Aside from the glorious sunshine\npop of 1994's Staying Out I or Ihe Summer, . it is the songs from Free Peace\nSweer that are engraved into the nation's consciousness, most notably that staple\nof commercial radio Good Enough.\nUndeniably catchy at the time (but now\nmore than a little annoying) it was this\nsong that catapulted Dodgy to stardom\nand Andy Miller into Dcnisc Van Outen's bed. Gone were the brown-haired hip-pies, here were the new clean-cut\nblond lcs with their pool side effervescence and cheeky c happy drummer.\nThis compilation was released two\nmonths ago and did little in the way of\nselling. It just went to prove that Dodgy\nhave neither a very loyal nor extensive\nfanbase, changing as often as their hair-cuts. Ihe highlights on this album arc\nundoubtedly the songs from Free Peace\nSweet such as If You're Thinking Of Me\nand In A Room, so anyone with an interest in Dodgy would be better off getting\nthat album rather than this one. d Ed\nCUBA\nThe Mass, Brixton\n: \u2022\n' . \u2022 : .

Cuba are relatively recent to\nthe music scene and their choice of\nvenue tonight is an ideal one, close to\ntheir roots. If you had been listening to\nany good radio stations over summer\nyou probably would have heard a track\nby Cuba and I was lucky enough to tune\ninto Crash IM in Liverpool, so I managed to hear plenty of new alternative\nstuff and what a surprise, there is actually loads of alternative music out there\nwhich you don't get to experience\nwhen you're constantly tuned into\nRadio 1! The track they released over\nsummer was instantly catchy, with a chorus that calls out to the masses,\n'Only together are we unstoppable',\nwhich is chanted over the drilled out\nbassline and pounding drums.\nWalking up to the Mass (formerly\nthe Brix), a church with a huge Mass\nlogo looms in front of you and as you\nwalk up the spiral staircase to the stage\narea the neon lighting tube running\nalong the railing changes colour,\nchameleon like, as though the mere\nmovement of your steps is fuelling it.\nThe music playing before Cuba\ncome on is excellent with a more chilled\nout hip hop version of ADF's Culture\nMove the definite winner. Cuba are\nmade up of two guitarists, bassist, drummer and geezer on samplers, with an\noccasional singer and brass section. They\nbegin with an instrumental attack, blasting the audience with a wall of guitar\nsonic thrashing aided by the pounding\ndrums and the blok e controlling the\nbeats.\nThe horn section arrive (three blok es with trumpets) and lift to greater heights\ntheir classic Only Together and new single Havana (obvious link to the band\nname here, except for those of you who\nhaven't heard of Cuba of course). Cuba\nonly play about six songs and sometimes you start to fidget when a song is\nstuck on repeat for near eternity, however this does not lessen the power of\nthe tracks, with Primal Scream certainly a definite fave of theirs in the past.\nHalf of the tracks they play have a clear live mood to them while the others\nsound as if they ought to be played to a club full of people shuffling to the subtle 'baggy' flavour of Cuba.

It begins with\nHenshall's attempt to stop ex-girlfriend\nHeadey marriage to Strong because he\nnow regrets cheating on het and wants\nher back. The film then starts down a magical path as Henshall, aft eta night\non thc bottle, meets some eccentric\nSpanish dustmen who allow him to\nattempt to right his past wrongs by\nsending him back in time to change his\nlife for the better. Or so he thinks.\nHis subsequent attempts to stop\nHeadey meeting Strong are hindered -which underlines the film's repeating\ntheme of the unchangeable nature of\nfate and the un avoid ability of destiny. If\nOnly is concerned with the consequences and regrets that te sul t from infidelity, with writer Rafa Russo drawing\non personal experience to construct his\nfirst screenplay.\nThc film has a distinctly European\nfeel with its vibrant, colourful scenes,\nand underlying romanticism. This comes\nfrom the all Spanish team of writer\nRusso, director Ripol, and pro duc cr juan Gordon who have carefully shaped the\n17\nQuick - someone pass me the sick bucket.\noverall atmosphere of the film.\nThe acting is generally good,\nalthough at times it comes act oss in the\nstyle of a BBC Christmas special rather\nthan a true work of cinema. This may be\ndue to many of the actors having a background in television. Douglas Henshall, previously in Sharpe, is good in thc\nlead role, thanks to enthusiastic (if a little over stated) acting, bringing an almost\nstand-up-comic persona to his character Charlotte Coleman effectively replays\nher four Weddings role as Headey's frumpy friend.\nThe tiny budget occasionally\nbecomes obvious, but this only serves to\nadd to thc film's charm. If Only would\nprobably appeal more to a female audience (semi-chick flick) but that's not to\nsay everyone won't find it engaging.

Train loads of dead bodies\nwere sent to India from Pakistan and\nwithout doubt thousands were killed\nwhilst migrating by train to Pakistan.\nIhe Irain to Pakistan was the one that\ngot away.\nIn a personal interview with the\nnovelist, Kushwant Singh, he explains\nhis first hand experiences and how he\ncame to w tite thc novel and later how\nthc film was produced.\nDuring the days of partition he\nremembers coming out into the streets\nand seeing fah ore in flames. Sikhs were\nthe easiest targets because they could\nbe identified by their long hait and tur-bans. He vividly remembers people\nbeing toppled from the it bicycles and\nbeaten to death. No doubt the same situation existed on the other side of the\nnew border. Trains full of people were\nsent along the main city lines towards\nthc new India - but when they crossed\nthc border and stopped, the carriages\nwere silent and only the hiss of the\nsteam engines could be heard as piles\nof dead bodies lay in the aisles. This\nscene in thc film is shocking to sec,\nespecially when someone is found moving around under the pile of bodies. The\nfilms shows how revenge completely\nengrossed the local villagers and the\nonly justice would be to do the same\nwhen thc tt a in to Pakistan goes past the\nvillage.\nKushwant Singh decided to write\nthe book while sctv ing as a diplomat\nfrom India to the UK and Canada. As a diplomat he found he had a lot of time;\n\"I got bored of just entertaining people\nand being called your tx cell cn cy\". He\nstarted the novel in 1949, and after publication in 1956 he attempted lo produce a film himself, but was refused a license by the government.\nforget thc cast of unknowns - the\nfilm itself is definitely worth watching,\nMoteover, this adaptation will appeal to\nanyone with an interest in his to ty, as it\np to vi des an important insight into thc\ncontinuing tension between the two\nnations.

    "content": "7 December 1998\nGames 15\nDigital Media World 1998\n| | |\nThis year Digital Media World showcased\nthc hardware and software powering\ncomputer generated images and multimedia show reels for the entertainment\nindustry. This year's top films have all\nused some sort of computer\ntrickery - from removing the\nodd stunt wire to recreating\nGodzilla and to fantasy worlds\nin 'Antz'. The software houses\nbehind 3D Studio Max, Softimage 3D and Maya, were all\npresent showing off their\ncapabilities with impressive\nshow-and-tell classes.\nKinetix, the makers of 3D Studio Max, have a strong\nhold in the compute t games\nindustry and titles such as\nBlade Runner (Westwood Studios) and Tomb Raider II (Eidos) have\nshown the potential of this 3D tendering\npackage. This year's main demonstration was 3D Studio Max's integration of\nDiscreet Logic's Paint & Effect software.\nThe main problem with creating realistic\nmm mm\n3D images is with the text ute that\nembodies the bare mesh. Creating a2D bitmap that wraps around a solid object\nwith the colours and shadings in the\nright place is a time consuming task.\nDiscteet Logic's software, how-ever, allows colour editing to be\ndone directly onto the 3D objects. Shaded areas are also re-editable since all drawing is done\nusing vector graphics.\nSoftimage is thc workhorse of many film and\neffects companies, and its\nhistory dates back further\nthan ki net ix' s3D Studio.\nIts ability to create realistic\nray traced images is due\nto Softimage's industry\nleading mental ray Tenderer and so has been used time\nand time again in films such as\nLost In Space, Titanlic and Antz.\nThe cost of these animation\npackages would give most people\na heart attack (roughly twice the\naverage grant) but MetaCreations Bryce\n3D at a to und[200 has allowed it to\ngather a cult following among home\nusers. Its main success must be due to\nits own intuitive interface, where realistic icons really do what they represent. It's gentle learning curve will have you creating beautifully 3D animated pictures in\nminutes rather than hours, when compared with other packages.\nMagpie\nSince many of you are looking for jobs\nthis year here are some tips for finding\na job in thc computer graphics sector.\nMost of the students here won't have had any formal tt a in ing but it is\nimportant for engineering and science\nstudents to have a good show reel of\ndemos and projects you have created.\nKnow your software packages, use\nthe back of thc popular games magazines to gauge what skills you need.\nEdge magazine is a good place to\nstart and you will notice that knowledge of either 3D Studio or Softimage is important. If you haven't got access to any of the top software titles try finding a job as a runner at a film/effect company, and\nthen try to obtain some after hour\ntraining.\nSome major games companies do have graduate recruitment\nschemes and since many of you\nwill have programmed in C and\nC++ your foot is already in the door.\nMagpie\nWargasm (PC) News\nInfogrames\nHey wow man, like let's not fight any real\nwars but just like fight on the computers\nand not spill blood and kill like fellow\nman. But what would the world be like\nthen. Countries would fight over silicon\ngenerated fields, with polygon people\ncontesting the control of other co un tries' resources. If this system was not\nsecure, and don't kid yourself that military means intelligence, what's to stop\nrogue elements messing around with\nthe system and exploiting it. Well welcome to the world of Wargasm. This is\nwhere you attempt to achieve world\ndomination by risking nothing but s otc atms, and ted taw eyes.\nDID has succeeding in creating a virtual battlefield without having to spend\nmillions on military computers. They\nmight therefore have cut a few corners,\nno Virtual Reality headsets or real size\nmock ups of tanks and helicopters - but\nthey have written it to be compatible with\nforce feedback joysticks.\nTanks skid and slide if you push\nthem too hard on dusty surfaces. Helicopters handle simply (no need to\nstudy a200 page manual before\nbreaking the chopper on thc floor).\nEven the foot slogging infantry move\nwith a realistic jog. The weapons are\nmodeled just perfectly. Hitting a tank\nwhile traveling at near full speed might\nbe difficult but the joy of it - well it\nalmost made me want to drive thc teal\nthing.\nSo perhaps it sounds a bit like Battlezone, where you could play both commander and fighting unit during a battle,\nespecially when you hear of the Multiple\nWargasm mode. So those people who\nenjoy shooting enemy tanks controlled\nby people thousands of miles away can\ndo so. But forgetting the gameplay and\nignoring the multiple player options there\nis one reason and one huge reason for\nthose people with good 3D acceleration cat ds to buy this ^ ^ ^ B game, and that is the graphics. PHHH\nThey are not just good but so -jS\nwe l detailed 111. >l in, inn\nlime\nmeant to be shooting and\nInstead si ood tin01 lou i is ii ing into the sun blasted deserts,\n01 al Ihe h isl ien \u2022\n< -mo . n \u2022\ntemperate zones. Tanks were j jp* there to kick up dust and to lay\ntracks in the sand and mud.\nIncoming, the eye candy award winner\nfrom the summer, might as well just get\nits coat and sulk because Wargasm has\ncrossed the borders and trampled its\nway to the top. The whole game is one\ncomplete visual-fc st. The soundtrack is\nsimilarly well presented. Along with the\nscreams of gunfire is a classical score to\nstir you into action. Schubert rides into\nbattle at your shoulder, so to speak.\nThis is the closest thing to total\nimmersion games without a body suit. It\nmight not have the detail of model control that a full tank or helicopter simulation has. It might be infuriatingly difficult\nat first, but if Christmas is a bit slow and\nthe turkey is faking its time going down,\npop on the headphones, fire up the PC\nand go take out some silicon slime bags, you might just leave the machine by\nNew Year.\nGary 5.\n\u2022ISS\nColor Gameboys\nYes, millions of people will be waking up\nto Xmas morning, with a special spelling\nmistake in their stocking. The Gameboy\nhas been kicking around in various flavors (sorry flavours) and colours, but til i now its display has always been shades\nof black.\nSo what's new, well thc colour\nscreen for one. It will play the new\ncolour games in proper (well almost\nproper) colour, as well as playing some\nin a weird pseudo-colour. Not all games\narc compatible though NHL '95 refuses\nto play, though V Rally works. A much\nsharper screen is also part of thc deal,\nalong with a neat infra-red port. It's a bit\nmore bulky than the pocket version, but\nthat's progress.\nDreamCast Preview\nWhile the Dteamcast was appearing in\nnumbers over the o the t side of the\nworld, a few here were treated to the\nnext generation of console power. To\nclaim a chasm inspiring leap in graphics\nwhen compared with other consoles\nwould be an understatement. Godzilla\ngenerations was impressive as Godzilla\nflicked aside buildings and tanks. But will\nSega get the price right in the UK? Will\nthe PSX 2 do to the DeamCast what thc\nPSX did to thc Saturn? We will know by\nnext Novembet.\n\n"

    "content": "7 December 1998 Music 23\nEnvoy\nrecently as we just did a couple of dates in London.\nHow long does a live set last?\nAbout forty-five minutes. It's sort of split in two. The\nfirst half is instrumental stuff, including tn voy tracks.\nThen I come out and do vocals for the rest of the set.\nAre the vocals live or pre-recorded?\nI'm on the mic and I sing to the crowd. It's all live!\nDo you record and sample them or do you sing\nsongs?\nI sing songs. It's hard to get your head around when\nyou think about how I do it...\nBut with all the Instruments and everything It must\nbe like controlling a whole orchestra and singing at the\nsame time!\nNo. Ithere's two boys, the HSC boys, who help with\nall the Envoy stuff when we record in thc studio. They\ncome out with me and control the synths and thc\ndrums and the mix ct while I'm out front. We do it all\ntogether.\nHave you played elsewhere in the world?\nNot really yet. We've done a couple dates in Europe.\nFrance and Norway. We haven't really tested Europe\nextensively yet. But we've done England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\nHow were these gigs received?\nIt all went down really well. But it all depends on\nwhat time you go on, who was playing before you. It's all about catching the crowd. Sometimes when I start\nthe set they're not really up for it, and I know they need\nto be entertained, and you have to work them like a good DJ. That's the bit I really like, going out there and\nbringing them over to our side.\nMany DJs say that two hours isn't enough time to\nbuild up a set. Would you like more time to play In?\nYes. I would really like more time. We could easily\ndo an hour for starters. It's just that we've been given\nforty-five minutes for startet s. That's what they say for\nlive sets. But you're right, on quite a few occasions thc\ncrowd have wanted enc otc s and I 've never legislated\nfor that. When it's over I want more time. I don't want\nto leave the stage but it's game over!\nFrom playing In Europe, how did you find the\ncrowds in other cultures? And the techno scenes In\nother countries?\nOne of the tea sons I took on the live gigs was that\nI always wanted to travel. I know quite a lot of DJs and\nI was always a little bit jealous when they we te going\nto these countries every weekend. I wanted to meet\nother like-minded souls who were into thc same music\nas mc. That's what's nice about travelling. It's amazing\nto go to another country and meet someone that has\nyour record and knows the tune. That is a really lovely\nthing. And when you make this music in you t bedroom,\nyou don't really know who it's going to reach. So to go\nthousands of miles to another country and know some-one's got your ep is a fantastic thing.\nDo different cultures react to the music In the\nsame way from country to country?\nNot really. I or instance Glasgow is a fantastic city\nfor house and techno. They really know their stuff. I'm not being sexist or anything but the girls arc as knowl-c gable as the guys. They're used to having good DJs\nup there. Lots of the American DJs come to Scotland first\nand play there before they hit London. Because they\nare so used to good DJs you have to work them. But if\nyou work them well they're true fans.\nWhere did the Inspiration come to make Where\nThere's Life? It's rarer for techno artists to make a flowing album (and not a collection of tracks) than say pop\nor rock artists.\nWell, going back to my past again. I'm a fan as I said\nbefore, and the albums that I own ate really special. For\nmc the word album is really special. In this scene I find\nit a bit strange that you put two bits of vinyl together\nin a sleeve and you can call it an album. Some people\ncall it a double pack. I don't like this word! Sometimes\nit's eight banging tracks or eight mellow tracks. There's no continuity. If I only make one album I want to be\nable to say that it was the best that I could do, that it\nis an album! If I die tomorrow then I 've made that album\nthat I 've really wanted to make. That's how I approached\nit. I wanted little intros. I wanted it to end in a certain\nway and ebb and flow and have something for everyone like a good album should.\nIs It Inspired from personal experiences?\nYes. Definitely! One of the things about mc is that\nI'm no to tio us ly very slow at making tracks. Hence four\neps over three years on Soma! But a lot of it is from personal experience\nCan you tell us what sort of things Inspire you to\nsit down In the studio?\nAbsolutely. Well I don't want to bring anyone down\nbut I entered into adept es sion this time last year. It was\na really serious depression where I had to seek some\nhelp. It's a hard thing this scene. One thing that we cannot take away from it is the word underground. It's ve ty easy for people who listen to think, \"I le records for\nSoma. I le must be doing well!\" But if you'te not a DJ\nand you only sell cp s, it's all an under gro ung thing. We\ndon't sell hundreds of thousands of copies, only thou-sands. It's a struggle. You haven't got a job but you want\nto make this music, and I was lit u tally on thc edge. I thought I would have to give up because I wanted to\nlive. But at the same time I thought I really had something to say with my music. I didn't have a place to\nrecord. I had all the ge at but I had domestic problems,\nrelationship problems and all manner of things lh at happened within a space of time.\nI actually got out of it because my record company\nSoma invited me up to Glasgow. I'd never actually\nbeen there before even though I'd been recording for\nthem for a few years. I went to Glasgow and almost\nmade another family. It\nwas wonderful. They\ncased my confidence\nback. When I came back il\nj usl all poured out! And l hal's Where's There's Life!\nThanks for sharing that with us. I hope you're feeling better now!\nYes I am. You know it comes in waves, doesn't it?\nI think it's great that you could express yourself like\nthat.\nI suppose it's a bit bolder because I'm naked in thai.\nI'm the te to be shot down. But I don't mind at al!\nbecause it's real. It's teal life and I think everyone can\nrelate.\nYou're also going to start your own record label. Can\nyou tell us about that?\nIt's actually with someone else, Mr Funk D 'Void (tars\nSandberg). The label is called Dark Night Recordings and\nthe first release should be out in the new year. We make\nthc tracks together.\nIs there a musical style or concept Involved In that?\nNot really. I think you have to imagine how Envoy\nand Iu nk D 'Void would sound like. Everyone has their\nprc-conceptions about how wc should sound. So wc\njust want to keep people guessing!\nDo you have other artists Involved In the label?\nNo not at the moment. It's really just for us to gel\nthc stuff we do out. In the fu t utc we would really like\nlo progress to that stage, the first few tc i cases are just\ngoing top be mc and Funk.\nElectronic music does get criticised. You talked\nabout the \"t word\" earlier! That dirty word that is so mis-understood. Can you defend the music from people\nwho say It's created by computers and has no soul or\nfunk?\nApart from putting on one of my records which is\na bit blas e, it is hard to defend. We'te in this scene and\nwe can't speak for every record that comes out each\nweek. To be really fair, for every great record there is\na record that is not so great. All I know is that since I 've\nbeen into it, every couple of years they say \"It's over!\nThey've been swept under the carpet and th cy 'te not\ncoming back.\" But we'te still here!\nYou can compare it to thc rock/pop scene The\nsame dinosaur giants ate making music in the present\nday. It might not be as great as when they were doing\nit in the 1970's but they're still making the music. I hat's like us! The same Dave Angels and the Juans and thc\nJeffs and thc Mad Mikes ate still making quality records.\nI don't think it's going away. I think we're here to stay\nand people have just got to accept it.\nIs a computer a musical Instrument?\nThere is a human input because you have to tap\nin! It really depends on how you approach the whole\nmusic-making side The way I describe the whole\ntechno thing is that as a fan, or for anyone listening to\nthe music for the first time, when I first put a techno\nrecord on I was blown away. I thought \"I low did that\nguy/girl make those sounds? How did that happen?\" I had a synthesizer and I thought, \"I'm going to try and\nmake those sounds!\" So you are stealing, but every\nmusician steals because you need a reference point lo\nstart off with. And that could be that fit st techno record\nyou put on.\na lick "

    "content": "7 December 1998 Columns\nMedicine Matters\nLike a phoenix from the flames...\nFollowing is a quick summary of the\nsituation regarding the medical\nschool union and its workings and\nrelations. Everybody hates us. Almost all\nof the competent and hard working\nmembers have quit and the rest are\nabout to go. Everybody is being investigated for financial irregularities. This summary was gleaned from a thirty-second\nglance over the last half dozen issues of\nfelix.\nWhat a load of bollocks, ICSMSLJ is\nprobably one of the strongest unions in\nthe College. It has taken the shit handed\nout to it by some small-minded tw at s both within the medical school and without and it has survived. It has put with\nmis-reporting on an almost criminal level,\nalleged near-bankruptcy and the backstabbing that would shock Saddam Hussein's regime.\nOn Monday night I attended a Union\nmeeting and if ever proof was needed\nas to how much the union cares about\nthe students it represents, and how hard\nit works on behalf of those students,\nthen this was It.\nThe medics' union\nis an effective body of\npeople working\nextremely hard to protect the Imperial Medics\nfrom people determined to screw them.\nThe last few\nmonths have seen\nsome bitter arguments\nraised surrounding the\nwhole medics at IC\nissue. Has anyone wondered why? Medics arc,\non the whole, good at\nstriking up friendships\nwith people. It is on the clinical syllabus\nthat you have to be seen to be able to\nestablish a rapport with people who are\nsick, in pain or even dying. Yet IC give the\nimpression that medics apply the sort of\nlevels of tact and sensitivity usually\nreserved only for bouncers and diplo-mats. Could this be the ugly green monster raising its head? My private theory,\nNick Newton\ndesigned as I write this\nto be as insulting to\nthose I wish to insult as\npossible, is this. Medics\narc so much better than\nthe non-medics at IC\nare. lake the example\nof the rugby team\nwhich is one match\naway from being top of\nthe English BUSA cham-pion ship.

    "content": "6\nLetters 7 December 1998\nResignation Explanation II\nDear Felix,\nI am writing this let tet to explain my\ndecision not to stand for the post of\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) of\nImperial College Union. I believe that\nwithdrawing my candidature is in both\nmy and the Union's best interests\nbecause of the unforeseen complications which have arisen due to the time\nof year at which these elections arc\nbeing held.\nBy the time the elections are held I will have completed virtually a whole\nterm of my third year. In my local education authorities opinion I would therefore not require funding for this 1st term\nagain and they arc thus only prepared to\ngive me any funding for the second and\nthird terms of my third year. This would\nrequire me (should I have won the ele c tion) to return to my studies after Christmas next year. I would also get no grant\nfor the 1st term meaning that I would not\nbe able to afford to live in London during the first term. This would be very\ndamaging to my studies and accommodation plans for next year.\nI appreciate the significant efforts\nthat the Union has made in trying to\nremedy this situation but, as there is no\nguarantee that a solution will be found,\nI feel that now is the best time for me to\nwithdraw from the election. I apologise\nfor any inconvenience that my withdrawal will cause the Union but I think\nthat continuing to stand in an election\nwhen I am unsure of whether or not I will\nbe able to take up the post would be far\nmore damaging to the Union in the long\nterm.\nI am still interested in this position\nand I am looking very seriously at standing for it again in the February elections\n(for next year) when the funding complications will not be relevant. I would\nalso like to take this opportunity to wish\nMarie every luck with her campaign as I believe her to be an excellent candidate\nfor what I am certain will prove to be a challenging position.\nYours Sincerely,\nTim Trailor\n\"Rugga-bug gars\" Dear Felix,\nI was in the Union last night [I.e. Wednesday 25 November - Ed], in dB's for the\nLovetrain/Shaft spectacular. As usual,\nthere were al! the \"Rugga-bug gars\" and\nwhat can only be described as hockey-buggers there in their shirts and ties.\nI don't know what time they all arrive\nafter their match/dinner/whatever, but by\nthe time the band had finished they\nwere thoroughly tanked-up. I was minding my own business when two of these\nI'm in a tie I own the building' chaps\nbarged past me consecutively. I turned\nand was like-what arc you doing? Being\nignored is not my favourite past-time, and\nwhen I was, I stuck my fingers up in\nprotest. Unfortunately the second blok e saw, and grabbed mc by the neck, pushing me through a group of people and\nnearly to the ground. Fie was shouting\nsomething to the effect of \"I'm bigger\nthan you so when you complain about\nme being awan ker,I have the right to\nphysically assault you.\"\nYes, how true he is (satire), I'm glad\nI share a science/technology/mcd i cine college with these sporty people.\nMy point is. Why? Why do you do it,\nsports freaks? Just calm down, loose the\ngr rrr b lo keynes s and people will enjoy\ntheir union nights more.\nCheers,\nPhysics Man\nEnvironmental Lectures\nDear Felix,\nFor some time there has been talk of\nintroducing new lecture courses into\nundergraduate degrees with an environmental bias. In order to be up to date\nwith other European (particularly Spanish)\nuniversities, the Environmental Society is\nproposing that lecture courses tailored to\neach discipline should be introduced as\n3rd&4 th year options. The resources to\nset up a humanities option which covers\nrenewable energy and sustainable agriculture already exist but we arc concerned that the depth of focus that\nstudents may need to enter into a particular area (such as rc new able s) could\nnot be achieved teaching a broad scale\ncourse, whereas it could within each scientific field.\nWe will be holding an open half day\nsession next term to which we are inviting academics who research and teach\nin these areas. We also hope that course\nadministrators will be able to attend so\nthat we can begin the process of designing suitable courses.\nWe will be putting supporters lists on\nlecture theatre doors and in common\nareas which we would ask anyone to sign\nwho maybe interested in these courses\nso that we can have an idea of their\npotential following. Signing would not\ncommit people to be involved but would\nhelp us to rally support.\nAnyone interested to learn more can\ncontact me, alternatively we meet on\nMondays at 6.00pm in Physics Lecture\nTheatre 2.\nTom Smith\nEnvironmental Society\nBack Off, Baker!\nDear Felix\nI could go on forever about Simon\nBaker's attitude towards Third World Debt\nbut I can't be bothered. A few points just\nhave to be made though.\nSimon challenged Jacob's statistics\n(from Unicef) with World Bank statistics\n(which arc notoriously unreliable). Asking\nthe World Bank its position on the situations it is creating is rather like asking\nSaddam Hussein if he's nice. I'm not saying that the statistics are wrong, but challenging his apparent assumption that\nthey are right.\nThe point that Simon makes about\nSouth Africa's education system being\nworse than Ethiopia's yet its economy\nbeing so much bigger just made me\npiss myself. The majority of the South\nAfrican poul ation have been denied basic\nhuman rights until very recently, and the\nprocess of reform is very slow. One of\nthese human rights was education. South\nAfrica is an extreme case, not an example of a global trend. The fact he uses this\nstatistic shows how he is trying to undermine and be destructive for the sake of\nit. I wouldn't care so much if he wasn't playing with 800 000 000 lives (number\nof people declared starving at Rio Summit, now considered a gross under est i mate).\nThe last point I'm going to pick up on\nwas actually quite a reasonable one.\nDoes relieving a country of debt re leif when its controlled by a military junta\nmean that you arc in cres ing the chances\nof violence? Firstly let me remind\nMr.Baker that Pinochet was put into\npower by the Chicago boys to reform the\nChilean economy, the Abacha junta is\npropped up by western Multinationals\n(80% of its economic turnover is from oil)\nand British and American companies\n(GEO Marconi, BAe etc..) provided the\narms, these countries were both totally\nundemocratic (Nigeria still is) and the\nroute to democracy in a country may\nnot be to squeeze its people so hard that\nthey can't defend themselves against\ninfections like Suharto, Abacha and\nPinochet (the tools of the west), but to\nallow its people water, healthcare, education and freedom of speech so that justice may follow.\nYours\nSuzanne Aigrain (Physics)\nImportant Notice\nThere will be no Felix\nnext Monday (14\nDecember). The final\nissue of term will come\nout on Wednesday 16\nDecember.\nThe Week Ahead\nMonday\nGames Meeting 12.30pm Film Meeting 1.30pm Tuesday\nNews Meeting 1pm Wednesday\nClubscene Meeting 3pm Deadline for Final Issue Articles 12pm Thursday\nDeadline for Sport & News 5pm Friday\nWe've finished for the term!

    "content": "\"/ was just thinking ... that here\nwe are, all of us, eating and drinking,\nto preserve our previous existence, and\nthere's nothing, nothing, absolutely no\nreason for existing\" - the thoughts of\nJean-Paul Sartre as he ate and drank ...\nand ate ... and drank.\nMan has questioned the meaning\nof life throughout his existence. In his\nbook \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the\nGalaxy\" Douglas Adams' answer is\nsimple and amusing - the number 42.\nHowever Albert Einstein, who dedicated\nmuch of his life to scientific research,\nbelieved that there was something more:\n\"religion without science is lame, and\nscience without religion is blind\"\nStudying at one of the top\nscientific institutes in the UK we may\nfind his point of view quite alarming -surely we can just study for a few years,\nget a degree and then find ourselves a good job. Einstein seemed to think that\nthis is simply not enough: \"we should\ntake care not to make the intellect our\ngod; it has, of course, powerful\nmuscles, but no personality\" - he\nrealised that however much we may\nwork, rest or play, life can still be\nincomplete.\nThroughout history, people have\nclaimed to know what this missing\nelement is and as Christmas approaches\nwe are reminded of one such man, who\nlived two thousand years ago.\n'Who do you\nsay I am?\"\nNO break tl He claimed that to make life\ncomplete we need to have a relationship\nwith God and that this can only be\npossible through him. He claimed to be\nthe Son of God. He claimed that his\ndeath would be payment enough for\neveryone's wrong doings. He claimed\nthat his resurrection from the dead\nwould break the hold of death on\nMankind. His name was Jesus.\nIn response to such outrageous\nclaims, CS Lewis concluded that Jesus\ncould only be one of three things - a liar, a lunatic or else he \"...was and is\njust what he said\". Lewis maintains that\nthere are no other alternatives - he could\nneither be just a good man nor just a prophet. It seems essential, therefore to\nexamine these claims in order to\ndetermine whether they are true or false.\nOne approach is to consider the\nmotives of Jesus and his followers -what did they have to gain from making\nsuch statements? The answer is startling\n- all of them expected persecution,\ntorture and ultimately a painful death.\nHistorical documents show that their\nexpectations were fulfilled in nearly\nevery single case.\nSo what do we do now? Should we\nfollow CS Lewis' example and\ninvestigate these claims or should we\nfollow Jean-Paul Sartre's lead and just\nponder ... and eat... and drink our lives\naway?\nYour call...\nBy Ivan Chow & Robin Godfrey\nCHRISTIAN UNION r Thrfiday .yd DPmvfcr\ntill Friday ff+ln fi w mh pr BOOK TABLE\nvenue: Sherfield Building common Area\nTuesday A tin bp omh t* THE HISTORICAL CREDIBILITY\nOF THE QUR'AN VS TH E BLBLE\nspeaker: Jay smit ti venue: wad Lec-ru rei heat re( Sherfiek\n@ lys rw tw\" JESUS (THE MOVIE)\nvenue: Electrical Engineering m \u00a7 wop m wop m$ CIENCE AND CHRISTIANITY\nspeaker: Fro fe as or conn pus.se 1\n1\nVenue: Senior Common worn\n\u00a9 b tx pm wop m( dinner included)\nTHE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS\nspeaker: Wy c rav ne venue: Senior cowman worn\n\u00a9 kc xp m^:.3op m( dinner included)\nFriday afa D ft Wiry rF IN DING MEANING IN THISWORLD\nSpeaker: r lich a el pam s den venue: senior common w? om\n\u00a9 kcc pm is jop m( dinner included)\n\n"

    "content": "7 December 1998 Arts 19\nMEPHISTO\nGuildhall School of Music and Drama\nDEATHWATCH\nOld Operating Theatre\nN ow come to the end of its run,\nWyn Jones' epic production of\nMephisto nonetheless deserves\nmention. Based on Arlane Mnouchklne'sdram at is ation of Klaus Mann's1936 novel, the play centres on a group of\nact ots in a small Hamburg theatre at the\ntime of the Nazis' rise to power in Germany.\nThe central\ncharacter is\nHendrik Hofgen, an ambitious radical\nactor in the\nPeppermill\nCabaret. Hofgen is repulsed\nby Nazi sympathisers within\nhis company\nand many of\nthe early\nscenes feature\ntirades against\nNational Socialism following the failure\nof the Munich Putsch. Yet alongside his\nsocialist ideology is a violent and\nmasochistic affair with his black mistress\nand marriage to a bisexual actress, which\nproduces a beguiling mix, convincingly\nportrayed by fer dy Roberts. Above all it\nis his burning ambition which sees Hofgen lured away from the mediocrity of\nthe Hamburg theatre by the chance of\nfame in Berlin.\nThough lack of subtlety and imagination ingrains much of the first half of\nthis work, it is the final scenes that mar-vel. With the failure of the ineffectual\nWeimar Republic and Hitler now in\npower, the Peppermill Cabaret is taken\nover by the Nazis. The director is sacked\nbecause his wife is Jewish and they subsequently throw themselves under a train. Other Jews escape from the the-at re, some disappear.\nMeanwhile, Hofgcn achieves great\nsuccess in\nBerlin but the\nirony is not\nlost when it is\nthe role of\ntau st that\nmakes Hofgen a star, as\nthe cattle\ntrucks roll\ntowards the\nconcentration\ncamps and his\nformer colleagues face\nexile or death.\nThere are\nstrong performances all round, especially by Finn Caldwell and Gemma Saunders. Sarah Blenkinsop's clever design\nallows the action to swing from Hamburg\nto Berlin without losing integrity. The\neffect is thrilling yet we arc left with\nmore questions than answers. Why considering his background does Hofgen\nnever examine his conscience? The play\nis dedicated to the few German writers\nand actors who spoke out against\nNazism. A roll-call of torture, murder and\nsuicide.\nNick Lamb\nNothing unusual about this play,\nit's in a theatre. However this is\na19 th century operating theatre\nand Herb Garret. Instead of patiently\nretiring in a comfortable scat awaiting\nfirst night nerves to settle, the setting of\na working museum provided a great\nvenue. The museum and theatre are situated in the roof\nspace of St Thomas's Church and with\nexposed beams, the\napothecary resembles\na barn - a long forgotten sight in the centre\nof London.\nThe crux of the\nevening was the play\nDeathWatch by Jean\nGenet, a psycho drama of three prisoners\ncaught in a complex\nsituation. It is somewhat difficult to transcribe the convoluted\nstory, but in essence\none inmate is incarcerated for murder;\nanother has a girlfriend outside, is illiterate and is becoming paranoid that\nanother prisoner - who writes his letters\n- fancies her. Essentially there is continual change in territory and power\nthroughout the piece, which grips the\nviewer in anticipation of the next development. There is an admission of guilt\nbetween inmates and as we see events\nunfold, the prisoners vie to kill one char-act er's girlfriend before turning on each\nother. Il omo sexuality, apparent from the\nfirst scene, seems to underpin the pris-on ers' relationship.\nthe acting was clean, sharp and well\nexecuted; however with only four actors\nand no props, overall it was a little difficult to suspended disbelief, although\nafter a time I became fairly absorbed.\nActually performing in an operating theatre gave the impression of clinical cold-ness, just like in a prison cell. The plot\ncertainly covered\nmany topical issues\nand some of life's subtleties, but\napproached homophobia and violence,\nfor instance, in a novel way,\nSince the writer\nGenet led such a traumatic life (he was convicted of theft on\nseveral occasions),\nthis play touches on\nrather personal ques-t ions. In addition to\nthe literary side of happenings at the Old\nOperating Theatre, don't forget that the\naudience gets a chance to view the\nmuseum as well and certainly both are\nworth seeing.\nBrett\nUntil 20th December\nPerformance times: daily except Mondays, 7.30pm Nearest tube; fond on Bridge\nAdmission: \u00a310/5\nDRAMSOC THEATRE PREVIEW: MACBETH\nUnion Concert Hall\nY ou're young, fast, ambitious. You\nget what you want one way or\nanother. Only this\ntime you want to be\nKing. What will you sac-rif ice? Who will you sac-rif ice? And just how far\nwill you go?\nSuch is the hype,\nsurrounding the forthcoming Dramsoc pro-duct ion. With only a few days left before\nthe run of the infamous \"Scottish play\"\n(I will forgo any comments on super sti tion!), I hunted down the acting director\nof the IC dramatic society in the Union\nlabyrinth for an exclusive pre-performance low-down.\nAlthough previously involved in\nbehind the scenes technical work, this is\nSimon Myatt's first forage into the realm\nof directing, the project has been in\nworking progress for a year; the play\nMacbeth is portrayed as a high\nflying financial\nexecutive\nwas proposed during the summer term,\nwith rehearsals started in mid-October.\nlie admits to never having fully grasped the gist\nof the piece, when he\nstudied it at school - all\nthe more incentive to\ntackle Macbeth now.\nAlthough the adaptation remains faithful to\nthe original text, the\noccasional adjustment was inevitable\nsince the play is set in modern times. The\naction has been transported to a City environment in an attempt to\npresent the classic in a more familiar context. The\naccent has shifted from\nmedieval mysticism, perhaps more intimidating to a Jacobean\naudience, to the contemporary themes\nof power, desire and greed (hopefully\n\"I have almost\nforgotten the\ntaste of fears.\"\npromoting the play's accessibility to individual sun versed in the Bard, with ou alienating theatre re gu lars). Macbeth is portrayed as a high-flying\nfinancial executive,\nwhose quest for authority\nis ultimately his downfall,\nwhereas the witches (of\ntoil and trouble, cauldron\nbubble fame) are transformed into dark, shadowy figures (in XFilesque spirit), who lurk in the\nbackground but pull the\nslings of the company.\nSimon Myatt's aim\nwas to create a stylish,\nminimalist and atmospheric interpretation of\nShakespeare's tragedy.\nThe cast of twenty or so members consists mainly of fresher s. Despite a few initial hiccups with e mail systems, he\n\"Lay on, Macduff,\nand damn'd be\nhim that first cries,\n'hold, en oudh'!\" describes the team as extremely\nfocussed and dedicated.\nTraditional swords\nhave been sheathed\nand shelved, exchanged\ninstead for guns and\nblanks. As the tension\nspirals, he promises an\nexciting twist at the\nfinale - in fact, the play\nstops before the end...\nApparently there's suspense galore, so\nwatch this space for the definitive review.\nHelena\nShowing at 7.30pm between the 9th and\n10th December\nAdmission: \u00a34 students (tickets available\nat the door on the night)\n\n"

The half-time score was 2-0, and\ndespite captain Elliot \"Ihe Boss\" Newsome bringing some continental flair to\nthe game in the form of Fred \"Garlic\nBread\" Gelloz, soon went to 3-0 following a half hearted save by keeper Stu\n\"stressed out\" Cook.

Ail in all we gave\na performance not to be ashamed of.\nIC V12 QMW\nTypically, the best performance of the\nseason ended in a negative result for the\nteam. After harrassing their defenders\nthe entire first half, some contentious\ndecisions by the referee, in particular a \"handball\" given against Mark Dawkins\nin the box led to their penalty being\nsaved by an ou standing J.P. Tom Walker\nand Will Doubor were excellent in mid-field, stringing passes together and creating chances, but they broke away and\nscored a scrappy goal against the run of\nplay. A corner on the stroke of half\ntime was swung in dangerously and\ndeflected in but we knew that we had\nbeen playing better than they had\nChiva opted for all out attack in the second half to pull the goals back. New\ncentre-forward Tom Lovell was brought\non for defensive midfielder Adltya Chair\nand the three-pronged attack produced\na goal when \"dazzling\" Fraz juiced past\na defender in the box and smashed the\nball into the roof of the net.

Assuming thc role of one of\nthese, the player must conquer the\nworld. Simple enough? Not quite, since\na major new feature of The Settlers\ncomes in the form of divine intervention,\nwith each race being backed by a particular god desperate to escape\nthe wrath of The Almighty'.\nfor those of you who didn't know, gam c play is based\naround producing a thriving\neconomy that ultimately will provide you with the means to complete each level. Starting with\nthe bare essentials to begin pro-duct ion, you must construct various buildings ranging from\nwoodcutters' huts to mines,\ngrain farms to temples and iron smelters\nto castles. Screw it up and you may find\nyour economy grinds to a halt, as your\nminers strike for want of food, or you run\nout of planks before you have built a sawmill.\nWhen you are powerful enough it is\ntime to vanquish the enemy. Some of\nyou may be disappointed that this does\nnot involve the cold-blooded slaughter of\ntheir happy-be-going settlers but a rather\nmore chivalrous approach of tat get ing their soldiers alone, with room for tea-breaks if required. Fighting this way is\nvery cool\nAltogether, this is one classic game.\nThe graphics and animation arc superb,\ncomplementing the charming gameplay\nwell. The plot is well defined and like the\ncartoon esque cutscenes it is well integrated into the game. However, nothing can beat the satisfaction that comes\nfrom watching your community go about\nits business. For this aspect of creativity\nalone, you should grab a copy of the\ngame.\nViv\nLucasArts\nManny in working uniform, flick scythe\nat no extra cost\nGrim Ian dango is the latest in a long line\nof fuca s Arts adventure games and was\nwritten by Tim 'Day Of The Tentacle'\nSchafer himself, so I expected great\nthings from this game . I certainly was\nnot disappointed.\nLucasArts have tried to modernise\nthe look of this game. Gone are the flat\n2D characters of pte vio us games, hello\n3D. This has the effect of making the\ngame look less 'cartoon y' and more film\nnoir. Unfortunately it also makes\nthc main character a little tedious\nto move around, but this doesn't really detract from thc gam c play too much and you soon get used\nto it. You play the part of Manuel\n'Manny' Calavera, the grim reaper.\nOr rather a grim reaper, sort of a travel agent in the world of the\ndead. Your job is to collect the\nnewly deceased and try to sell them\ntravel packages to Ihe afterlife. Ihe\nbetter the soul has lived their\nlife, the bette t package they can\nafford, fowl if es get a walking\nstick and a four year walk, while\nnuns etc. get a ticket on thc\n'number 9' express train, here to\nthe afterlife in mete minutes. Of\ncourse, you are on commission\nso the better the souls you col-lect, the sooner you can get out\nof here and go to the afterlife\nyourself.\nSo why don't you manage to\nget any of the good souls when the\nreaper in the next office seems to get a few every week? There is something\nfishy going on in the land of the dead\nand you are determined to find out what.\nSo starts a tale of corruption,\nintrigue, chrome and horticulture that will\nkeep you tied to you computer for days.\nOne criticism I could level is that the\ngame is rather linear, but luckily the puzzles are for the most part logical and well\nthought out so that you don't get stuck\nin one place for too long.\nDavid Howell\nMedievil (PSX)\nCrystal Dynamics \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe person who came up with the graphics is obviously a Tim Burton fan, a very\nbig Tim Burton fan. In fact if you knew\nthat he was a big Tim Burton fan it would-n't surprise you to hear that the hero's death in battle is actually the start rather\nthan the end of the game. The hero Sir\nDaniel Fortesque was killed by the lead\nbad guy, Zarok the wizard, and Gallowmere was turned into a world of\nnasty undead creatures and zombi fie d villagers.\nLuckily though\nyou have a second\nchance as Dan has\nrisen from the dead\n- and having lost\nsome weight (his\ninternal organs and\nflesh mostly), he's fighting fit and ready\nto take on Zarok and his undead fol-lowers. Dan is going to do this in true 3D platform gaming tradition by slaying minions and occasionally end of level bosses,\nsolve puzzles, and attempt to stay alive,\nwell undead anyway, fot long enough to\nmeet up with the wizard.\nSo Tim Burton styled lead characters\naside is thc game worth its medieval\nsalt? Well the sublime graphics are just\nperfect. Just play the first level and watch\nthe little dismembered hands scuttle\nacross the ground, the lighting effects of\nthe torches on walls and fences, the animation when the swords\nand throwing daggers are\nused in anger. The split\nbetween slaughtering\nand puzzle solving has\nalso been thought out\nand the non-linear nature\nof the levels allow a level to be returned\nto at any time (in fact it is essential go\nback to previous levels to complete the\ngame). Unfortunately this leads to the\none and only gripe (well apart from pop-up, but hey I can be generous in such a well detailed game). Once a level has\nbeen cleared it regenerates all of its nas-ties so that the next time round it is just\nas difficult to complete and definitely\nnot as enjoyable. Aside from this it is a perfect example of thc 3D platformer - so\nsally forth to yonder s hoppe and proffer\nyour monies for said game.\nGary S. Gangster's Paradise\nSo hello to all those who entered the\nEidos Interactive's PC Gangsters competition to win a copy. The Answers\naccepted by me were\n1. The Coen Brothers Directed the Film\n'Millers Crossing'\n2. The Italian Job featured 3 brightly\ncoloured mini's, the mafia and a heist in\nTurin.\n3.

Fellwanderers Fall\nICSM top the league Part-Time Infringement\nVictim to Minibus Fault\nICSM rugby students have exceeded\nall expectation by winning the Il ali fax sponsored, British universities southern premier league. The team has no\ndoubt benefited from the merger\nbetween St. Mary's and Charing Cross\nunder the IC name bringing about\nunexpected victories over universities\nreputed for their strength, teams like\nBrunei West fond on. A victory in the;\nnational play-off against the northern\nchampions, set to take place at the\nend of January, would nicely round-off\nthe team's already impressive performance. Fastrack to IC PhD\nSome of the top physics professors are\ncurrently debating over whether physics\nstudents should be allowed to take a PhD after just a three ye at degree\ncourse. At the Standing Committee of\nPhysics Professors held last month, Malcolm Longair, head of physics and\nastronomy at Cambridge said \"although\nit is not absolutely mandatory, we very\nstrongly encourage people to do a four-year course\"\nConversely, the IC physics department does not consider a four-year\ndegree to be mandatory for progression onto a PhD. Dr R Burns, the admission tutor at IC, is confident that \"\nsomeone with a three-year degree\nfrom IC is adequately trained to do a PhD\"\nOxford Dispute\nTwo undergraduates at Oxford university have been threatened with exam\nand lecture suspension if they fail to\npay the newly introduced tuition fees.\nThey were given until the end of last\nweek to pay the money they owed,\nbut as Felix went to print the result of\nthe dispute had still not been resolved.\nThe students were protesting at the\nrecently introduced controversial government policy that requires all undergraduates to contribute \u00a31000 towards\ntheir tuition fees. It is believed that the\naction taken by Oxford was the first of\nits kind over the new policy.\nResearch undertaken by thc university\nof Central London have found that\nsome students are spending the equivalent of two days a week part-timing to\nmake ends meet. Their survey also\nshowed that 2 in 5 full-time undergraduates had a part-time job, which\ncorresponds to a10% rise over a period\nof three years. The danger is that some\nuniversity students may suffer academically as a result of trying to support\nthemselves financially. This comes in\nthc wake of the on-going tuition fee\nsaga, which still arouses feelings of\nanimosity.\nMedical Correction\nfast weeks article \"Wade in Resignation Nightmare\" stated that Oli Warren\nhad been asked to stand down by the\nICSM Admissions Tutor. Since this article went to press, we have learnt that\nsuch a meeting did not take place, and\nwould like to apologise for any in con vi eni en ce caused to either Mr Warren\nor Ms Burnett.\nBy Tony Ofori and Gareth Morgan\nThe fell wanders were at the centre of a potentially catastrophic situation due to\nthe mechanical fault in a minibus.\nOn 22 of Novembet. the IC Fellwanderers society left London in a Union\nminibus and headed up thc Ml.

It Is\nbelieved that this was directly attributable\nto a mechanical problem. Fortunately,\nthe driver managed to get the bus from\nthe fast lane to the hard shoulder avoiding collision with any other vehicles.\nHowever, the bus did hit the ct ash barrier beyond the hard shoulder, and was\ndamaged in thc process. Alhough the\nbus was thc only casualty, thc society\nmembers were forced to wait three\nhours at a nearby service station before\nthey could return to college.\nICU said that the cause of the crash\nwas uncertain, and that an insurance\nassessor would determine what actually\nhappened.\nIt is tumour ed that sufficient information was known about the un road worthy bus to avoid its use prior to thc\nevent.

Weeks of arduous organisation\nand preparation were unceremoniously\nupstaged by delinquents searching for\na venue to stage their latest brawl.\nAs the Tamils' show continued\nwithin the Great Hall, trouble was brewing outside. At approximately midnight\nthe show's doormen began to argue\nwith a strangely insistent group of\nyouths, who wished to gain entry without tickets. Sherfield security became\ninvolved, separating the groups and\nseemingly defusing the situation,\nunaware of the continuing animosity. A senior member of security ironically\ndescribed thc state of affairs as \"a storm\nin a teacup\". Seconds after the comment thc first floor of the Sherfield\nBy Andrew Ofori\nBuilding became a battleground as two\ngroups standing either sides of the\nst a its clashed and fists flew.\nThe non-IC groups were described\nby some elements of the Union as \"mil-it ant\" Tamil gangs who had clearly chosen Ihe ICU Tamil night as an\nappropriate meeting place The gatecrashers were spotted earlier on in the\nevening, congregating on thc walkway\nand many appeared inebriated.\nMembers of Sherficld security\nrequested urgent back up and sealed\noff the stairs as the brawl ensued on the\nfirst floor, as is \"standard practice-according to security chief Ken Weir. At\nsome stage during thc night's disturbance, a window in one of thc walkway\ndoors was shattered as one brawler\nwildly brandished a bottle.\nAs the groups withdrew one unfortunate emerged clutching his eye, Sheffield security led the individual to the\nground floor where he revealed his\nbloodied face. Security duly attended\nto the wound until an ambulance\narrived. Mr. Weir was keen to emphasise \"We have no control over external\ninfluences\" but judged that \"the level of\nsecurity must have been adequate for\nthe needs.\"\nAs a result of the melee thc show\nwas ended and the 'after show grind\nsession' cancelled. The unsuspecting\naudience were led away in one direction and the troublemakers ushered\noff in thc other. Ken Weir explained\nonce the youths realised \"they were\non a hiding to nothing\" they left peace-fully.\nSecurity decided to summon thc\nPolice in order to ensure the rabble\nmade a tranquil exodus from college\npremises. This calm seemed unlikely to\nlast as cars packed full of people were\nparking along Exhibition Road and consorting with the ousted revellers.\nTamil society were anxious to highlight \"the people involved in the incident were not IC students\" and went on\nto \"thank thc IC security for their help\nin dealing with thc matter\".\nReview of the ICU Tamil Society's annual\ncultural event on page 2\nNicholaou to stand unopposed\nOne of the two candidates for Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies), Tim\nTrailot, has withdrawn from thc cam-pa ign.

Apparently his local education\nauthority have refused to fund his\ndegree for the first term of next year,\nas he has already completed the\nAutumn tet m this year. Even if college\nagreed to cancel fees for the Autumn\nTerm, Mr Trailor would still be unable\nto get a grant. Although some Union\nsources have said that it is possible the\nUnion would pay his grant for the\nAutumn Term, the resolution of the\nproblem is by no means certain. Mr\nTrailor felt that this situation would be\n\"very damaging to my studies and\nac como dati on plans for next year\",\nand that it was therefore in \"both my\nBy Ed Sexton\n\u2022'.

Firstly,\nthe film is entirely shot in France (Paris\nand Nice) which makes for a refreshing\nchange of scenery that adds to the mood\nof the film. They've tried to include a plot\nhere but it seems to have been written\nby a student from Truro polytechnic. Several times logic failed me. I think they\ntried too hard on the plot side and there\nreally was no need. A film should stick to\nits strong points and Macbeth it ain't. What it is though is an out and out\naction movie. As the cast career across\nFrance in pursuit of the case, adrenaline\nlevels are kept high with a succession of\ngun-battles, confrontations and truly\namazing car scenes. Now wc come to\nwhy you should see this film. Not since\nThc Italian job have I seen such amazing\ncar chases. They might not be as inventive as the Michael Caine caper but for\npure energy rush it's unbeatable. The driving is in your face, on the edge of your\nseat stuff, the car shots are very realistic\nbecause the actors are always pictured in\nthe car without a fake background. The\nstunt driver is c it her in the seat beside\nthem (using a car with two steering\nwheels) or ingeniously positioned in the\nboot (the cars were specially rigged up\nso that a stunt driver could steer the car\nwhilst sitting in the trunk. Not ve ty reassuring for thc actors).\nAs far as acting goes, with a script\nthis perfunctory there's not a lot of Oscar\nworthy emoting going on. De Niro, as\nusual, slides with ease into a role that\nrequires him to be a star first and an actor\na distant second. Reno, Skarsgard and\nPryce all acquit themselves well. Newcomer McElhone doesn't let herself be\noutdone by the seasoned actors. The\nonly concern is Sean Bean who was just\ncrap; luckily he doesn't hang around for\nlong enough to spoil the film.\nAs far as action films go, you could\ndo a lot worse than this, and the car\nchases are simply breathtaking. Maybe\nnot one for the cinema but definitely\nworth renting out when you've got a few mates round. D Mark\nRounders *\nStarring : Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich\nDirector: John Dahl\nF or those of you who haven't see\nthis movie already, the simple message is don't both et unless you're\na poker fanatic (and I stress the word\nfanatic). Whenever I think of poker, I imagine high tension and big bets with\nenough excitement to make you sweat.\nInstead Rounders greets you with a group of people who are obviously -painfully so at times - just going through\na routine. It might as well have been a documentary about banking.\nOnce again Matt Damon gets to play\nan everyday guy who just happens to be\na genius. This time around, however,\nhe's not an academic genius but a poker\none. He plays Mike McDermott who is a law student with a passion fot poker. So\nnothing at all like Good Will Hunting\nthen.\nAs you've probably guessed, this is\na film about poker, poker, and more\npoker. There is nothing else - even\nthough the plot tries to involve something different, namely Mike's girlfriend.\nShe does thc 'it's me or poker' thing -Who'd have thought that looking like a smug g it could be so profitable.\nwhich is fair enough if your boyfriend has\njust blown enough money to get him\nthrough college on one game of poker,\nthen expects you to help him out. This bit\nc it her should not have been included or\ndeveloped a bit more. It was so thin that\nit would have made Kate Moss fat.\nThere is also the regulation best\nfriend who's got into trouble (through\npoker of course) and subsequently\nDamon gets into trouble because of him.\nWell, the story had to involve something\nof interest.\nTalking of s to ty where was it? the\nfilm just went from one poker game to\na not hc t with so much poker jargon you\nmight as well have been watching the\nfilm in another language, tv en thc big\nfinale was disappointing. It was supposed to be a poker game to match all\npoker games. Damon was playing\nagainst the bad guy (John Malkovich)\nwhose exciting trait is the ability to say\n'son of a bitch' in the most peculiar way.\nThc outcome of thc game was obvious\nbefore it s tatted. It was a dull film full of nothing but\ndull people with a dull plot. There was\njust one thing that made it interesting;\nMatt Damon's personal tutor handed\nover ten thousand dollars without expecting to see it again. Now that's the sort of\npersonal tutor I want!

Well she's back with more of Ihe same, the album\nis almost sample free, all original, which is definitely not\nthe norm these days, but thc girl pulls it off. The 15 track\nalbum has quality written all over it with the standouts\nbeing Little Bit of Lovin, Kiss Me, Love and My Love.\nMilen\nQuestion: How does one follow up a multi-platinum\ndebut set?\nWhat up people! After a two week break Tha Bomb\nhas returned with album reviews for the wicked faith\nEvan's effort Keep The Faith, thc latest set f tom Whitney Houston and the second album from thc Bad Girls\nof Bad Boy - Total. As well as that you got some random\nshit from yours truly, and news of thc \"Tha Bomb\nParty\".\nFirst up I 've got cuss down the latest tune from Will\nSmith - Miami; this is the wot st tune to come from Will\nSmith, since the last one he released. The boy is going\ndownhill very fast, with 'Miami' he uses the all time classic And the Beat Goes On by thc Whispers as his backing and does his usual fucking shit over thc top. This\nappeals to the t ce ny bopper s out there (entered the\ncharts at number three, what the fuck is wrong with the\nworld?), but anyone with half a brain knows he's just\ntaped a classic.\nSnoop Doggy Dogg celebrated his birthday on\n20th November and then flew into fond on last week\nfor a date at Sub. Just as he was getting into some of\nhis classic tunes somebody fired off a blank, causing\nchaos and ending up with the crowd all going home.\nSnoop was said to be very pissed off; someone should\nhave informed the boy that Ladbroke Grove is our\nanswer to Compton. Talking about Compton, Priority\nrecords are releasing a tribute album: Straight Out Of\nCompton - 10th Anniversary fri bute. The album celebrates the anniversary of the original release of 'Straight\nOut Of Compton', the album which introduced the\nwo tld to NWA and the gangsta rap style. Ice Cube, Dr\nDre, Eazy-E and MC Yella exploded on to the main st team of US music with what are now hip-hop classics. The\nalbum is a series of covers, original NWA tunes covered\nby latter day artists including Big Pun, MC Eight and\nmany others. The hits covered include Fuck f he Police,\nQuiet On The Set and Express Yourself.\nThis year has seen the return of thc excellent Beverly knight and now we have the rel urn of the beautiful 21 year old tast Londoner Kele Le Roc and her\nstunning scl Everybody's Somebody. When she first hit\nthe scene, in 1995, she rocked the placer and we knew\nI ot the First Lady of Bad Boy, it seems like that Iai th had no problem in tackling this seemingly mammoth-sized task. Before I start giving you thc LD, there's one\nword that springs to mind about this album: INCREDIBLE!!!! lor all you RnB connoisseurs, this is the album\nto go and buy ASAP! Because of Milen constantly\nreminding us (and I really DO mean reminding!), many\nof you will have heard Love Like f his by now (and\nshame on you if you haven't!), f his is thc first single\nto be lifted f tom the album, is currently on general\nrelease and deserves to be a lop 10 hit at least. Borrowing from Chic's Chic Cheer, this is an up-tempo\nnumber that will have you dancing along or head\nnodding all night. Another notable floor filler is All Night\nwith its truly infectious chorus: 'Wc can dance, dance,\ndance, Clap your hands, hands, hands...'\nThc rest of the album is very much down-tempo,\nit's difficult to decide which tracks arc the best; they're\nall genuinely amazing. Perhaps thc Kelly Price collaborations of My First Love and No Way ate worthy of a special mention as well as the Babyface-produced\nNever Gonna Let You Go.\nWhat is impressive about Keep The Faith is that\nthere ate no signs of the sometimes overbearing production and trademark sounds of Puffy. Iai th sings and\nwrites from the heart and it shows Don't worry, girl,\nwe remember you and we'll always Keep thi; Iai th, Kidphobee\nyou say ana\nong, I hear some of\nally scheduled for a' hit ney' s4 th studio\nour sli 'les last week\noil an all < Mh js i You'll Never\nX':.

With\na first choice team at his disposal, Big\nDaddy Masefield was expecting the first\nwin of his reign.\nThe whistle sounded and they were\noff. The first twenty minutes were played\nout at a moderate pace. RSM's back line\nwas never stretched and in attack frontman Henry Dowell looked odds on to\nbreak this season's duck.\nEventually RSM converted some of\ntheir pressure but not before Birkbeck\nwere allowed to properly test the RSM\nmet tal. It was after as c amble in the Birbeck that Nigel Milner opened his\naccount with a neat finish into the corner of the goal. Unfortunately that was\nthe only conclusive action of the first half.\nAt half time all objectives were in\ncheck, although the lead needed stretching to comfortable proportions. Chances\nwere still being created and squandered\nwith painful regularity. The score was\ndoubled with a text book solo run from\nJohn Williams who skillfully weaved\nthrough the Birkbeck defence and then\nshot clinically from an acc utc angle to\nscore.\nA sigh of relief was breathed and\nmore goals were promised but for the\nlacklustre RSM finishing. The Birkbeck\nkeeper needed a travel card to retrieve\nthe ball when Skip unleashed a powerful yet pit if all drive, despite being advised\nnot to by Ihe rest of the team. When\nDoug Spikes replaced an injured Jerome\nColllnet, it took him little more than a minute to add his name to the score-sheet.\nThis is how the match finished. A job\nwell done and the first scalp of the sea-son.\nX Country\nIC travelled to Trent Park for the fourth\nleague race of the ULU championships.\nOur initial joy at Brunei's absence was\ndashed by the presence of blatantly fit\nlooking runners.\nThe frantic pace at freezing temperatures and heavy ground forced\n\"Compulsive Liar\" to abort well founded\nhopes of winning.\nThe Bedfordshire Burd blundered in\nin third place, with Quite Contrary 13th ans Slick Vic an appalling 16th. Due to\ntheir unrivalled success the women\nwalked away with victory.\nThe mens race turned the form book on its head with some frankly shocking\nperformances. Andy and Benny Boy\nblew their attempts to win a race spectacularly and ended up second and third,\nwhile Andrew Beckwith of Kings was let\noff the hook to win. Taz managed to\nscrape in 8th, while Hcadlcy finally\ndetached himself from his bike to finish\n17th. Daisy boy at last managed a decent performance for 24th. with\nWannabe 26th. Bartboy led home the\nseconds in 31st, with the Kraut in 39th. The frankly a pall lng performances of\nMike 35th and Compulsive Liar 42nd dented what would have otherwise been\na good set of results.\nThe rest of the IC runners trau led in\nholding hands because it was cold. Kinky\nmanaged 10 more places than last time.\nIn reality, of course, IC stormed to victory\nin both races obliterating all competition\nbefore returning to the bar where the\nULU committee convened in secret to\ndecide the BUSA team...\nIC Virgins\nRoyal Holloway0-31 IC\nWe beat them at home and now we've\nbeaten them away. I his is the first\nmatch we've played since bonding with\nthe medics and together we're in vinci ble. With 5 tries and 3 conversions,\nwe'd certainly had our Weetabix that\nmorning (not sponsored by Weetabix\nbut open to offers).\nthe first half was tight all the way\nthough with only one try scored by\nEwok during an attack of awareness by\nrampant forwards. Romy was un fir tuna tc ly denied by the ref, the only person on the pitch with the ability to stop\nus scoring.\nIC finally started putting the dominance they held over the opposition to\nadvantage in points, Stroming tries\nfrom Betsy (twice), little Clare and Cecil\nled to an approximate average of\n1.00786 points a minute during the last\nquarter.\nOur super sub, Ranit, trashed their\nmidfield defence, with excellent support from all. I his match was amazing\ndue to the fact that the only time Holloway made it into our half was at the\nkick-off, what a difference to the 79-0\nthrashing that we suffered at their hands\nlast year.\nWe are looking forward to the BUSA\ncup next term. Special thanks to our brilliant coach, hon a ray virgin. Matt \"I'm original seep down really\" Cockayne.\nRifle Shooting\nBISLEY AFTER BACON\nAfter Turkish Delight, steamy windows\nand bacon sandwiches the valiant rifle\nshooters set off to Bisley. Arrival al the\nvertically challenged Siberian range was\nmarked by appropriate freezing tem-para ture s and heavy,rain. Ihe shooting\nover 100 and 200 yards was impressive\nwith mos l of the rounds hitting the tar-gets.\nIu neh was notable lor the only spell\nof sunny weather during the day and the\ncopious amounts of fish and chips con-sum ed. As always fellow shooters from\nother clubs gathered to admire, cheer\nand congratulate us on our fine\nweapons and technique.\nDrenched, dripping and delirious\nwe were taken on a grand tour of the\nfine town of Bracknell on the return\njourney.

    "content": "s Columns\n7 December 1998\nRight Angles To Reality\nColds\nF or Hot Chocolate, it started with a kiss. In my case it started with itchy\neyes and a nasty tick ly feeling at the\nback of my throat. I had been using the\nword processor all morning, and had\nspent a good five minutes at lunchtime\nchoking on a piece of sweet corn that\nhad somehow found its way into my\ntuna and cucumber sandwich, so that\ncould account for the symptoms. But by\nthe time I went for a late afternoon coffee break and found myself unthinkingly ordering a cup of tea instead, my\nworst fears were confirmed - I had a cold. Or had I? Maybe it was just a sniffle, I reasoned with myself; two paracetamol now and a Lemsip before bed\n(an early bed mind - bang goes Newsnight), and I might just get away with it.\nThen again, this could just be the beginning of something worse - Lassa fever\nstarts with 'flu-like symptoms doesn't it?\nBut as I hadn't been in contact with anyone from Tibet for over a fortnight, that\ncouldn't be thc problem. My brother, a medical student, had once cheerfully\ninformed me that in their initial phase\nmany contagious diseases resemble the\nonset of the common cold, and that at\nsuch an early stage it was impossible to\ntell whether the patient would go to\nbed and wake up feeling fine, or go to\nbed and not wake up at all. As I was in\nbed semi-delirious with a temperature of\n105\u00b0F at thc time, I found his enthusiasm\nfor epidemiology less than infectious.\nWhatever the case this time, I was\nobviously sickening for\nsomething and I had to\nknow whether I was\ngoing to get over it in a day ot two or be cruelly\ncut down in my prime\nby the ague. Initial\ninvestigations were not\nencouraging. I had\nfailed UNCOSTT - the United Nations\nConfirmation Of a Sore Throat Testwhich fot the uninitiated, consists of\nseeing whether you can sing the harmony part to The Beatles' 1964 hit tight\nDays A Week all the way through (my\nvoice gave out on the second round of\n\"hold me, love me\"s), and holding my\nhead on one side with my tongue\npressed against the back of my mouth\nwhilst swallowing forcefully, had clearly\ndemonstrated that a build up of catarrh\nin my nasal-aural tract was in full swing.\nThat put the tin hat on it -1 was officially\npoorly.\nWhen I was a child, having a cold\nwas almost a cause for celebration, esp e Matt Salter\n\"...I had failed UNCOSTT-the\nUnited Nations Confirmation\nOf a Sore Throat Test - which\nfor the uninitiated, consists of\nseeing whether you can sing\nthe harmony part to The Beatles' 1964 hit Eight Days A Week all the way through...\"\n\"Lassa Fever\nstarts with flu-like\nsymptoms\ndoesn't it?\"\ndaily if the day in question\nwas a Thursday as you got\nto miss Mrs Mettam's weekly assembly\nin the gym. Then there was the happy\nprospect of mum making you cups of\nOvaltine and b tinging the small black\nand white telly that your dad bought in\nLast Getmany into your room so you\ncould watch daytime TV as you suffered.\nAbout the\nonly time that\nI got to watch\nRainbow was\nwhen I was\noff school\nwith 'flu -which\nseemed good\nat the time\nbut has\nresulted in an\nunfortunate\npsychosomatic cond i tion, whereby\nI get a fever\nand a runny nose if I even so much as\nhear \"up above the streets and houses,\nrainbow climbing high, ev'ryo nc can see\nit smiling over the sky\". The same affliction has left me unable to enjoy Thunderbirds, Stingray and The Sullivans\nwithout feeling slightly unwell - I could\nsue. Of course, being off sick had its\ndownside. Apart from the unpleasantness of the cold itself, there are only so\nmany of those big bottles of Lucozade\nthat you can drink without throwing up (8 in\nmy case) and also the\nsmall matter of having\nto put on a Bri-nylon\ndressing gown and\nshuffle off shivering lo\nthe toilet every five\nminutes. Another problem I encountered as a childhood invalid\nwas that of sleep. I frequently used to\nbotch up the timing badly and get my\nrecommended daily intake of shuteye\nduring daylight hours (normally during\nPebble Mill at One and Nationwide) so\nthat when night came I was wide awake,\ncondemning myself to a long lonely vigil\nwith only the World Service for com-p any. Needless to say, by the time Farming Today came on at 5.30 am I was a knacker ed, bloodshot-eyed wreck who\nagain slept through the day, selling thc\nwhole sorry cycle off once more.\nIt was even worse on thc rare occasions that I got sick when my mate tna l grand moth et was staying. She and my\nmother differed wildly on\nthe proper treatment of a 'flu-stricken child. My grandmother\nfavoured the tuck-'em-up-and-keep-'em-warm approach and turned my sick bed\ninto a boiling, heaving mass of scalding\nhot water bottles - one on each side, one\non my tummy with yet another for my\nfeet. Combined with i he three ex lta eiderdowns\nthat pinned\nme to the\nmattress, they\nensured that\nmy already\noverworked\nhypothalamus\nwas pushed to\nthe limit, and If tcq u cnt ly awoke from\nmy uneasy\nmid morning slumbers convinced that my\nbed had\nsomehow turned into a paddling pool.\nAt this point my mother, who was of the\ngerms-don't like-the-cold-why-c lse would-they-send-TB-patients-to-Switzerland\nschool of thought, would inevitably\ncome in, take one look at her son with\nhis scarlet complexion and sopping hair\nplastered to his forehead and immediately start divesting me of my layers of\ncladding and by now lukewarm-water\nbottles, whilst shaking her head and\nmuttering under her\nbreath. I was the\nhuman embodiment of\nthe Freeze-Thaw\nProcess. Had Victorian\nfreak shows still been\naround I could really\nhave made a killing.\nAbout the only thing\nthe two of them agreed on was that you\nshould \"feed a cold and starve a fever\"\nand took it upon themselves to \"keep my\nstrength up\", with the result that I ended\nup eating six meals a day and putting on\nabout a stone in weight during the\ncourse of my confinement.\nThat was then and this is now. My\nsymptoms had grown progressively\nworse and I had reluctantly taken to my\nbed. Lying huddled up in my BH S12 log,\nshivering feverishly, I was forced to admit\nthat getting sick as an adult is a very different, and much less pleasurable experience than it was as a child. There is no\nmum to plump up you t pillows and bring\nyou hot lemon, no dad coming home at\n\"...I was the human\nembodiment of the\nFreeze-Thaw\nProcess...\"\nsix o 'clock and asking how his little soldier is, and above all there is no Joe 90\ndouble bill on IlV. Having left home\nover ten years ago, I am quite used to\nliving alone, and although there is nothing so guaranteed to make you aware of\nyour solitude as spending a week in\nbed and not seeing a soul from one day\nto thc next, I could cope with the isola-tion, but thc dramatic decline in thc\nquality of daytime television since my\nchildhood was something I hadn't bargained for. Admittedly I now have a deeper understanding of thc problems\ntranssexuals addicted to prescription\ndrugs face in trying to gain social acceptance in the southern United States, and\nhave discovered the secret of how to\nbake a Victoria sponge lh at just gives to\nthc fingertips, but otherwise my period\nof enforced viewing was less than edi-f ying. I found myself completely un riveted by Mikey agonising over whether\nhe should go to uni or take a year out\nand work on his uncle's sheep farm,\nand was similarly ambivalent towards\nthe mysterious disappearance of Mrs\nMcTavish's faithful little Willie. Why is\nthere never a good National Geographic\ndocumentary about shat ks on when you\nwant one? Lven an implausible 1950s scifi adventure story acted out by men\ncalled Rock wearing tinfoil space suits\nwould do; anything but the depressing\nparade of low-budget talk shows presented by RADA rejects that currently\nseem to be in vogue, f vent u ally I could-n't stand another\nminute of this tabloid\nTV and, as I didn't appear to be getting\nany better, I decided\nthat thc time had come\nto dig out my polar\nexplorer coat and struggle off to the quack's, for a first opinion.\nWhen I finally got in to see Dr Patel\nhe examined me for some time, then\nwith a puzzled look on his face, he\nmade a few notes and shook his head\nbefore turning back to me. My expression must have betrayed my anxiety,\nbecause he gave me a reassuring smile.\nIt was nothing to worry about, he said,\nI had contracted something called 'Alice'\nwhich, whilst not being serious, was\nunusual. A course of antibiotics and a few days bed rest, and I would be as\nright as rain. I asked Dr Patel what causes\n'Alice'. He shook his head. \"Nobody\nreally knows\", he said, \"but Christopher\nRobin went down with it\".\n\n"

This isn't an attempt to try out\nnew styles, but a result of computers,\nin particular IBM based machines,\nbeing unreliable. Yes, once again\nthe Felix server has shown itself to be\nthe embodiment of all things evil,\nand Windows to be the manifestation\nof the devil (I like Microsoft really -please don't sue us).\nSo thank you to our printers for\nletting me use their Macintosh to finish this edition, and if any DOC students fancy making a million and\nnot selling their soul; please, create\nan operating system and that is reliable when running a network.

To do this I need your help. If you have had any\ninteresting experiences with any\ndrug, legal or illegal, good or bad, I want to hear from you. You can, of\ncourse, remain anonymous - simply\ndrop letters into the office or email us\n(emails will be deleted after down-loading). I would also like to hear\nfrom any members of college who\nhave had experience with drugs, or\ndrug users, as part of their research.\nI myself am a drug addict -1 smoke\n20 a day.\n-Ed\nBound Editions\nBound editions\nfrom last year are\nnow available.\nPlease drop into\nthe Felix office\nbefore the end of\nterm if you ordered\na bound edition at\nthe end of last year.\nFree Concert!\nImperial College Winds will be giving\na lunchtime concert In the Great Hall\non\nWednesday 9th December\n1pm It won't cost you a thing, so please\nbring all your friends.\nIf you'd like to know more about the\nprogramme, please take a look at the\nposters on the walkway.\nCity & Guilds College\nUnion\nOfficers & Members\nCommittee Meeting\nThursday 10 December 1998\n6pm Guilds Office (Mcch b ng Rm 340)\nAll welcome\nPapers to be submitted by 5pm Tuesday 8th December to C& GU Office\nSouthwell Hall Subwarden Position\nSouthwell is a hall of residence situated in Lvelyn Gardens (walking distance from\nthc main campus).
