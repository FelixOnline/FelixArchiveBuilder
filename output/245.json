Events at LSE however overtook the proposals then the suspensions of Bloom and Adel stein were at that time confirmed by the Board of Governors. In addition the E atrophy Group felt the press and television were hostile to the student case. An\naccount was therefore drawn up of the history of the term's events at LSE consisting: mainly of quotations from motions and statements and presenting both sides of the case. Copies of the report signed by members of the IC Union Executive were sent to the principals of other University of London Colleges, to officers of the University and to the' press.

    "content": "4\nEDITOR'S l^om ment We herald the start of another terra with another special issue of FELIX': the start of another summer term and the beginning of the end of another academic year. The end of an academic year' means exams for most of usa frantic but nevertheless dreary drag towards the success or failure for which we are all primarily here the gaining of a degree. However, we can gain more. Not only is it in our interest, it is also our duty to enrich ourselves by reaching for reality and ruthin a more gene a! area than in our own specialised disciplines. And it is continually within our right as students to protest at k what we see as bombastic, insincere, false, cruel oro merely misguided. It is our right and duty as students to protest and lobby, but to protest democratically, when we see^ these things. This is what the students at L.S.E. have attempted to do. The administration at L.S.E., by interfering in their attempt to discuss, and perhaps to disagree with, the appointment of Dr. Walter Adams as their new Director, has impugned this right. We may disagree with the L.S.E. students on their objections to Dr. Adams,( one cannot but feel sorry for the man's difficult position), but noone can deny their right, or even their \u2022 n ty, to display their disagreement. The L.3.S. students in their stand against Sir Sidney Caine, have had; o withstand a largely hostile press speaking to a hostile public hostile In Britain, because there exists a resentment against\" Interfering and meddling students living idle lives on public money. n This, of course, is unfair since the average student IS undoubtedly more hardworking and conscientious than most of his contemporaries abroad. We can, however, only he pe to change this attitude with time. The report by i. he Entropy Group on the' L.S. S. deo ac leif in no other way is in this sens s valuable; for presenting a. scrupulously, fair picture of the vents at L.&.E. FOLK CONCERT\n\"Druokeo Mights\" at Albert\nHall\nThe occupants of the Royal\nAlbert Hall on the evening of May\n9 th, will see the beginning of a mew era of cars l val'. a et iv i ties. If all goes well the folk concert,\"\nwhich is be img held in aid of the\ncarnival charity, should raise a sum of money which could exceed\nthe total sum raised by the whole\nof last year's carnival. T ke possibilities of such a concert ware first discussed by\nPete Bold on and Steve Grant some-time last November. After brief discussions with Jerry Stockbridge and t ke Albert Hall authorities it was decided that the concert\nwould take place, despite enormous difficulties in finding an artist or artists t \u2022 top the bill. Although it was found that the\nconcert required a great deal more\norganisation than expected, it is now almost certainly assured of a sellout. The concert, which is advertised in this edition, is not just\nan occasion for the ardent folk fan. The entertainment dispensed\nby the' \u2022 ' . \u00bb , . five huge and hilarious Paddies from t ke fair Isles\" will suit many tastes, and we are\nhoping for a large support from\nthis college,( tickets' can be ob-tai ned from j>66 Keogh).\nIf this concert is as big a success as the optimists among us\nsuggest,, then there is no reason\nwhy a large concert such as this should not be a regular carnival feature, possibly even twice a year.\nSteve Grant\nFELIX EDITOR Assistant What' sOn Sales Photographic David Potter wi gelS hindle i Ken Simpson Chris Palmer Dave Or nist on With: Steve KailI n son, Stewart Barnes, Paul Smith, Colin Harrison, Worthington Ease, Frank Morris, Lynda, Caroline, Lindy, Gilli.

This week with students returning to L.S.E. the latest accounts point to a quiet term with a committee working towards student staff cora pat ability. On March15? some members of the' I.C. Debating Society went to L.S.E. to suggest a postponement of the final of the U.L. IT. debate competition. In the words of C.

Bruce Gottlieb and Andrew Jordan therefore formed the Entropy Group to provide an outside initiative. A document thought to be acceptable to both sides was drawn up.
