Big enough to give a man\nscope. Yet, because each of our nine British\ncompanies largely runs its own affairs, not so\nbig that the essential 'human touch' is\nendangered.\nThis balance is reflected in our executive\ndevelopment training which, far from ty j nga man down to any one type of career \u2014\nproduction, sales, administration - allows him\ntime to discover his true potential.\nThis way, we invariably find that the graduate\nassumes managerial responsibility more confidently - and certainly earlier - than is usu a( in a modern industrial complex.\nAsk your Appointments Board for further\ndetails, or write direct to:\nManagement Appointments Adviser, Turner &.\nNewall Ltd., 15 Curzon Street, London, W.1.

Well the choice\nis up to you, but we did produce\nfive plays last year, and we even\nstaged an opera. Then there was\nthe Revue that we did at the end\nof the Summer Term. I think it\nwas called \" Three\" because it\ncomprised of a revue, a play, and\na musical. That makes it nine\nproductions of various sizes.\nDoesn't that mean that there's a chance for Freshers?\nWell I suppose so. One of the\nplays for the London University\nDrama Festival i was almost 100\nper cent. Fresher content. There\nwere quite a few Freshers in the\nChristmas play \" Ring around the\nMoon.\" There were two Freshers\nin the Revue, only they weren't Freshers, because they had had so\nmuch experience in the other\nthat they had been in during the\nyear. They enjoyed themselves.\nYou meet people.\nBut I can't act!\nNor can many of our members.\nWe call them stage crew. They're\nexperts, though. There's a lot of\nvaluable equipment back-stage. It\ntakes experience to drive it pro-per ly, but many have this experience. The scenery doesn't fall\ndown, either. It's well built. Very\nwell built. We have a workshop\nby the stage, set aside exclusively\nfor the use of Dram. Soc. by the\nUnion. We are the sole purveyors\nof high quality theatrical equipment and appliances to the Union\nfunctions.\nDidn't you go to Hamburg last\nsummer?\nYes, we did \" The Lady's not\nfor burning.\" The Germans loved\nit. We had to print more tickets\n\u2014in German even. They applauded for six solid minutes at\nthe last performance. We tried to\nstop them . . . but. . . The staging\nwas a creative challenge.\nWe lost some of our members\nras B. Sc. (Eng.) and B. Sc. They\nwere experts at Stage-craft. We\nshall have some who hope to be\nB. Sc. (Eng.) next year. We need\nsome new experts. It takes 7\nweeks to learn the operation of\nthe Sound equipment\u2014properly\nIt takes a long time to learn the\nworkings of the lighting gear\u2014\nproperly. The stage offers many\nchallenges for creative design.\nI expect someone will tell you\nabout the Fresher Reception we\nhold later. You get a bit of food\nand some tea, I think. You get\na tour of the stage as well. It's rather interesting. You can come\nalong if you want, it's free.\nOr come up on the Stage on\nFreshers Day and see for yourself\n\u2014and talk with us. That's free as\nwell. Free of obligation. We like\nto meet people.\nOh, I forgot; you don't want to\njoin the Dramatic Society.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX11 CROSS-COUNTRY\nTHE BEN NEVIS RACE This year's race, held on Saturday 7th Sept. was as stiff a test of\nstamina as any in the history of\nthe event. IC's contribution to the\ntotal entry of 227 runners was a four man team; C.E. James, P.D. Crews, D.M. Reaves and I.K. Pereira. Ex-IC man C.P. Woodcock was also in the party,\nbut an injured ankle prevented\nhim from taking a full part in the\nrace. Nigel King, and old Centralian, also went along and acted\nas a supporter.\nThe course, one of the toughest\nin Europe, is 14 miles lor/; and\nextends from Ford William at sea\nlevel to the top of the 4,406 ft.\npeak, and back again. Steady rain\non the day of the race made the\nrock-strewn mountain path both\nmuddy and treacherous.\nA pipe band led the competitors to the start where there was a surprisingly large crowd to cheer\nthem on their way. To begin with\nthe IC team held well back, being\naware of the long climb ahead.\nBy half way, Crews lay 46th with\nJames close behind and climbing\nsteadily. Both Reaves and Pereira\nwere further down the field. Conditions at the summit could only\nbe described as arctic. It was here\nthat several exhausted runners\nsuccumbed to the elements and\nlater had to be treated for expo-sure.\nComing downhill was more\nthan just half the race. Crews\nlacked confidence in descending\nthe s cree s and so slowed down.\nWhen the runners fell back onto\nthe final stretch of road James\nhad caught right up, thereby\nshowing superior technique and\nfitness. Meanwhile Reaves and\nPereira managed to held their\nown.-- At the finish, James and Crews\ncrossed the line 55th and 56th, both with the time of 2: 6: 11. It\n-was Reaves' first attempt at the\nrace, and a commendable one at\nthat (113th,2:24:35). No doubt\nthe future will hold some improvement for him. Although\nunfit, Pereira (122nd,2:28:1) returned a time which was only\nslightly down on last year's per-form ance. Woodcock had to\nnurse his ankle, but despite this\nfinished in 2:48:1 and showed\nwhat taking a little care could do.\nThe overall winner was P. Hall\nof Barrow A.C. in a record 1: 41:\n45, and the team prize went to the\n1 /6 Q.E. O. Gurkha Rifles. UL runner P. Littlewood was 15th in\na good time of 1: 56: 7.\nP.D.C. THE CLUB\nI. C.C.C.C. is a club with a shining past and a future that depends largely on you. The departure of our top dozen or more\nrunners over the last two years\nmeans that we are looking for\ntalent of every standard for the\ncoming season.\nIf you ran, cross-country at\nschool, then why not now ? For\nour size we must be one of the\nbusiest clubs in the Union. We\nrace twice a week and on many\ndays there is even a choice of fix-ture. Apart from matches in\nand around London there are\ntrips to Exeter, Southampton,\nLeeds, Brighton and also an Easter tour of probably Ireland.\nWhether you ran at school and\nare toying with the idea of keeping up, or are a confirmed addict\nto the sport, come and see us in\nthe Concert Hall on Freshers'\nDay. Come then, or turn up for\na fresher s' run (nay trot) on\nWednesday, 2nd October. This\nis purely a social occasion. We\nwill meet at 2.30 p.m. inside the\ngym and then tea will be provided afterwards: For any further information see the club\nnotice board at the foot of the\nstaircase outside the bar.\nBADMINTON CLUB\nThe Badminton Club welcomes-all Freshmen and invites all those\nwith any interest in the game at\nwhatever level to join the club.\nThe club plays three men's teams,\na mixed and a ladies' team. The\n1st and 2nd men's teams; play in\nU.L. U. League one and last year\nthe 1st team topped this League.\nThe men's3 rd team, a new de-part ure, will play in the U.L. U. League Two and will provide\nmatch play for the less experienced members of the club.\nMixed social matches are arranged\nand the club plays a number of\nfriendly matches, notably against\nOxford and Cambridge 2nd teams. During the year there is\na 'singles championship for the\nmembers and once a year we see\neach other in trousers or dresses\nfor the first time at the club dinner and theatre visit. Like many\nI.C. sports clubs the principal\nbattlefields are somewhat removed\nfrom South Kensington, although\nwe have limited facilities in the\nUnion Building. Travelling instructions and details of trials will\nbe available on Fresher's Day and\nwill appear on the club notice\nboard.\nSQUASH\nA YEAR TO REMEMBER The Squash Club had a memorable year, four cups, an\nalmost unbeaten record, a tour of\nIreland and burnt out courts. This\nyear promises to be a difficult one;\nat the time of writing (August) no\ncourts have yet been found, but\nour fixture list is more impressive\nthan ever, and a professional will\ncontinue to give instruction. Our\nNo. 1 remains Sherrif Affifi, an\nEgyptian International, unless the\nsecond team have been practising\nover the Vac. We run two teams\nwith a variety of home and away\nfixtures, and we are rarely affected by the weather.\nThe Squash Club will have a stand on Freshers day, and the\nwhereabouts of this seasons\ncourts and trials may be obtained\nthere; pay us a visit.\nJ. M.C. IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nRUGBY FOOTBALL CLUB\nThe I.C. R.FC. is one of the largest clubs in the College running\n9 XV's every Saturday. The 1st XV plays the second teams of most\nbig London clubs such as Wasps, Richmond, Esher, etc., and the\nstandard gradually falls to the B5's who play against anyone's Ex B. All fresher s will therefore find a standard to suit them.\nTrials are being held at Harlington on Wednesday and Saturday next and free coaches are\nprovided from the Union and it is\nhoped to see as many fresher s along as possible.\nThe club trains on' Monday\nevenings in the gym 5.30\u20147.30\nand Thursday 12.45; for tactics\nand training in the park. Keen\nmembers are invited out on Tuesdays also. Please note training\nis compulsory for intending members of the 1st and 2nd XV's and\nothers are very welcome to come\nalong.\nThe University knockout cup,\nhas been won by Imperial College 9 times in the past 12 years\nbut unfortunately we are no\nlonger holders, failing miserably\nto retain the trophy last year. So\na great effort is required from\nevery member in every team to\nensure a good fit healthy club and\nto bring back the cup this season.\nI do hope I can count on the cooperation of every member of the\nclub in this mission.\nALAN HAVA RD, Captain.\nI.C. ROVER CREW\nVISIT ICELAND\nTwelve members of the Rover\nCrew joined the l.C. Expedition\nto Greenland aboard the m.s. Gullross at Leith on June 24th, and sailed for Iceland. During\nthe first meal on board, the\nRovers, ably assisted by the\nmembers of the expeditions pre-sent, succeeded in devouring virtually all of the cold buffet pro-vi ded, much to the amazement\nhorror and disgust of the\nstewards' However, during the\nrougher periods of the voyage,\nfood was not so popular. . One\nunfortunate member of the\nCrew discovered (the uncomfortable way) that an evening in\nthe bar was not a good thing\nbefore a rough night.\nIceland was eventually reached\nafter two and half days and\nmany puking s. The party stag-ga red ashore at Reykjavik, only\nto be overcome by a strange\nattack of \" land sickness.\" (You\njust can't win !) A representative of the Icelandic Scouts was\non the quay to meet us and took\nus to to their H.Q. where we\nspent the night after a day's sight-seeing in the town. The\nnext day we were taken on a bus\ntrip by Dick Phillips- Iceland's renowned walking tours leader-past the mighty Gullgoss waterfall to the hot springs of Huerervellis in the central desert, returning at 5.0 a.m. next morning to\nSelfoss. Some of f the party left\nin the afternoon on an expedition\nto Mt. Hakla, while the remainder stayed to see the milk processing factory, entertain the\nlocal children and explore the\ncountry round about, before departing on the Monday for\nLoridmaunalauyer\u2014not far from\nthe area visited in 1960 by an\nI.C, Expedition. En route the\nHekla conquerors (and \" con-que rees\") were picked up, and\nafter much pushing of the bus\nthrough the soft volcanic dust,\nthe destination was eventually\nreached in early evening.\nA week was spent amongst the\nhot springs, strange colours and\nlunar-type scenery, most people\nmaking'the 50 mile round trip to\nEldgja\u2014the world's largest volcanic fissure, with the truly magnificent Ofaerufoss tumbling into\nit. '\u2022' \" ..\nThe final part of the camp was\n50-mile hike over the Torfajokall\npass to Fljotidal (near the Myrdalsjokal in the South). The set\nof directions provided by Dick\nPhillips proved invaluable in\nhelping us over the little used\nroute, and providing an alternative to map-reading.\nFljotidal was eventually\nreached, the hike had provided\nmany magnificent views, debates\n(especially on the method of\ncooking luncheon meat) and\ngood laughs, as well as the usual\nquota of blisters.\nAfter returning to the Scout\nHQ. in Reykjavik, most people\ntook advantage of the town's swimming pool for a good-wash,\nand then spent the remainder of\nthe time souvenir shopping.\nThe camp ended in the traditional way with a dinner of local\nfood, held this time at the Hotel\nVik, at which we entertained\nDick Phillips and Mr. Octogen of\nthe Icelandtic Scouts Association.\nThe voyage home proved\nrougher than the outward one,\nand a fund was organised to be\ngiven to the last person to be\nsick, subject to certain conditions\nabout attendance at meals. This\nwas won by Vic Moss, who used\nit, very public-spirited ly, and\nbought drinks all round, whilst\nsailing up the Firths of Forth on\nJuly 15th, "

GUILDSMEN\nAll Freshmen can start reading\nhere:\u2014\nIf you aim to study mining,\nmetallurgy or pure science, then\nyou can stop reading here.\nThis article is for men only\u2014\nGuildsMEN. You have decided\nto become an engineer. You\nhave been selected to carry on\nthe age-old tradition. Tradition\nbased on success. Success, that\nis, at the expense of Mines and\nR.C.S., the existence of which\nyou will no doubt realise in the\nweeks to come.\nFor your information, R.C.S. stands for R.C. Schroter, Guilds\nPres.\nFor your entertainment, R.C.S. also stands for :\u2014\n(1) The National Anthem ;\n(2) Royal College of Science ;\n(3) The broom handle and ball\n.cock.\nThe broom handle and ball\ncock is called Theta, an antiquated phallic symbol R.C.S. calls a mascot. They claim that\nTheta resembles a thermometer.\nMine's mascot is not a pickaxe\nor coal shovel as you might hope.\nActually they boast a Michelin\nMan that they pinched from an\nold Michelin lorry or something.\nThey also painted it black and\nyellow. Presumably black because they are Miners and yellow because . . . well . . . yel-low.\nThe Guilds mascot is the\nfamous SPANNER. Custom cast\nfrom lead alloy] and painted a. luxurious silver, and maroon, it\nweighs nearly 701b., and is over\n3 feet in length. The spanner is\nheld aloft by the President at the\nend of every union meeting,\namidst the famous Guilds war-cry \" Boomalaka.\"\nEarly last year. Guilds assembled a catalogue of college\nmascots. Most impolite really\n\u2014R.C.S. and Mines weren't even\ninvited to the experiment. They\nwere so annoyed in fact that the\nR.C.S. President volunteered to\ndo a song and dance in front of\nseveral hundred Guildsmen.\nMines begged us to accept half\nthe return fare of their mascot\u2014\nfrom Bermuda.\nAs an act of-goodwill, Guilds\neven set about decorating the\nR.C.S. Physics building. The 30\nft. Spanner pasted to the outside\nlooked very nice indeed. The\nscar remains to this day despite\npathetic attempts to scrape it off.\nGuildsmen have also had fun\nat the expense of other objects.\nTo name but a few, there is the\nAlbert Memorial, U.L. U., Bedford College, Putney, Chelsea\nPolice Station, London Transport and several private motor\ncars.\nWhich brings us on to\nBoanerges.\nThis renowned 1902 vintage\nJames and Browne motor car is\nresplendent these days in a livery\nof maroon and silver and free\nfrom all tarnish. Bo takes part\nregularly in the Brighton run although now this is becoming\nquite an effort. Recently Bo became the father of twins, two go-carts, who are beginning to give\nhim a bit of a run around. He\nalso pays an annual visit to the\nLord Mayor of London and attends the May Ball and the Engineers' Dinner Dance.\nThe latter is the highlight of\nthe Guilds social calendar, and\nthe best formal occasion in the\ncollege. A less formal, more\n.riotous event is the Guilds Carnival, a whole night of wine,\nwomen art d song guaranteed to\nshorten your life by at least ten\nyears. So\u2014-don't miss it.\nThe college boat race takes\nplace anu ally on Morphy Day.\nTwo races are held and last year\nGuilds kept place with tradition\nby winning them both. Beforehand, Guilds and R.C.S. do\nbattle on the muddy towpath.\nUsually Guilds are triumphant,\nleaving their victims half\ndrowned, trouser less and neck-deep in mud. As with all sporting events, such as the Swimming\nGala or Sports Day, the Union\nBar is the final target.\nIn the summer, we have the\nGuilds Field Cup, held in Hyde\nPark. This is a treasure hunt,\nwith the Serpentine and the local\nConstabulary as the main ob-st a cles. No holds barred\u2014no\nBar holds the winner.\nAs has been said before, success is the cone of Guilds tradition and the secret is PARTICIPATION ! Anything goes well\nif everybody takes part. This is\nthe essence of any successful en-ter p rise. And so Guildsmen, with\nFreshers Dinners on us once\nagain, remember that whether or\nnot this is to be a year to be remembered depends on you.\nLet no more be said . .'\u2022\".]\nBob Schroter, President.\nRod Jones, Vice-President.\nMike Cox, Hon. Secretary\nThe I.C. Gliding Club expedition to Aosta, a gliding site in the\nItalian Alps, was its most ambitious ever. In guide book parlance,\nAosta is set in what must be\namongst the most magnificent\ngliding surroundings in the world;\nthe glider pilot, reading between\nthe lines, would correctly infer\nthat Aosta is not for beginners,\nand the party was chosen accord-ingly.\nAt dawn on 17 July, Beit\nWarden Frank Irving and crew of\n3 set forth from Prince Consort\nRoad with our Skylark 4 on tow.\nMeanwhile, Mike Neale (I.C. President 1954-55) and crew of\n3 were on the way to Dover from\nLasham with our Eagle 2-seater.\nEventually the Alps appeared on\nthe horizon, which Frank surmounted via the 8,000 ft Grande\nSt. Bernard Pass with nothing\nmore than light passenger assist-ance, Mike choosing the Petit St.\nBernard, allegedly for its superior\nscenery. A shattering drive of\n700 miles in 30 hours (only 17\nhours actual driving) by Bill\nKronfeld and crew of 2 brought\nthe party up to 11, leaving 3 more\nto arrive later by various means.\nAosta Valley is only -3 or 4\nmiles wide between the peaks on\neither side, some rising 10,000 ft\nabove the valley floor. With intense sunshine (very reliable!) the\nvalley soon resembles an oven,\nand the hot air rushes up the\nmountain sides in the form of\npowerful thermals. All you had\nto do, then, to get an unforgettable\nview over the Alps was to circle\nin one of these thermals and let it\ncarry you above the mountain\ntops\u2014or so we thought. In fact\nit turned out to be more difficult\nthan this and the route to the\ntops was often found rather close\nto the mountainside, demanding\nskillful flying in very turbulent air.\nMoreover, the turbulence near the\n! ground made the aero-tow launch\nand the landing rather difficult,\nso that a few of the less experienced pilots did not fly solo, but\nthey nevertheless enjoyed some\nextremely interesting flying in the\nEagle.\nOn one of the better days, Bill\nKronfeld climbed to 13,000 ft and\nflew ,in the thermals from one\nmountain to another and eventually reached the Matterhorn, 20\nmiles to the north-east, before\nreturning to Aosta. This flight\ncreated a considerable stir in the\nworld press, for Bill was seen by\nskiers from Breuil, a town at the\nfoot of the Matterhorn. Within\nhours telephones were ringing\nwith excited reporters at the other\nend, who contrived in their usual\nway to get the story wrong.\nIt appears that this was the first\nreported flight to the Matterhorn\nfrom the Italian side in a glider.\nWhepher this is the case or not,\nBill had fulfilled one of his ambi-t ions. Thirty years ago, his father,\nRobert Kronfeld, pioneer of\nthermal soaring, had made the\nfirst ever glider flight to the Matterhorn.\nWhen not engaged ,in flying,\nmiscellaneous break-away parties\nwere sampling the night-life, etc.\nRemote, high altitude night spots\nseemed irresistible, mostly, one\nsuspects, on account of the hair-raising drives up and down those\nspectacular mountain roads. In\nthe heat, thirst quenching proved\nto be a problem. The local water,\ncontaining .20 per cent, alcohol,\nhad a very strange effect on some.\nCutting a long story short (the\nrest will appear some time), we\ndid 140 hours of magnificent flying in 3 weeks, more than we\ncould hope to do jj na whole\nEnglish summer. Four pilots who\nneeded a flight of over 5.hours\nduration as one of the requirements for the Silver \" C\" certificate realised their ambition;\n9,000 ft was exceeded on 13\nflights.\nFor full story with slides and\nfilm, come along to our Freshers'\nmeeting (see Gliding Club notice\nboard),\nUNIVERSITY of LONDON CONTINGENT\nOFFICERS TRAINING CORPS\nHAVE YOU JOINED?

    "content": "6 FELIX SOCIAL CLUBS\nat\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nIf your interests are. political,\nphilosophical, religious or nat io nal, or if you like debating, then\nyou will probably want to join\none or more of Imperial College's Social Clubs during your stay\nhere. \\ Reflecting every strongly-held opinion, left and right, home\nand abroad, theist and atheist,\nI.C.'s broad spectrum of Social\nClubs offers in the student world a taste of society at large, a chance\nto come to grips with the real\nworld before you get there. University life provides you with a unique opportunity to learn, to\nlearn not only about your chosen\nfield of study but about other\npeople and other people's beliefs.\nScience and technology will de-mand,,, much of your attention\nwhile you are here, but a little\ntime spent in trying to understand\npoints of view other than your\nown will be time well spent: Colleges like ours, specializing in\nscience and engineering, can very\neasily be accused of breeding one-culture men, scientific barbarians;\nwe like to think that our well-organized and actively-supported\nSocial,Clubs help to give the lie\nThere are five political societies\nto such accusations.\n\u2014Socialist, Conservative, Liberal,\nCommunist arid C. N.D. \u2014and if\nyou think you are a bit too rightwing for any of these there is the\nFlat Earth Society for ultra- con-serva t ives. I.C. political societies\nhave a reputation for getting big\nnames in the political world to\naddress their meetings. Last year\nHarold Wilson, Peter Thornycroft\nSelwyrt Lloyd, Eric Lubbock;\nthis year, who knows, we might\nsee better (Lord Denning?). Links\nwith the University of London\nsocieties are strong, and many\nI.C. men help to run the U.L. Uorganizations. Delegates also attend national student conferences.\nPhilosophical and religious societies are numerous. The Huxley Society, named after the famous T.H. Huxley, once Dean of\nR.C.S., represents the scientific\nhumanist and rationalist view-point. Christians of almost every\ndenomination are catered for by\nfive societies: Church, Catholic,\nChristian Union, Methodist and\nS. C.M. Most of these hold regular devotional and prayer meet-in gs, apart from the more controversial meetings. Students of\nJewish belief can join the Jewish\nSociety, and we also have a Theosophical Society and an Islamic Society.\nOverseas students will want to\nwatch out for the International\nRelations Club, which has a programme geared to their needs and\ninterests and which has been very\nactive in recent years. There are\nalso a number of purely national\nsocieties, the Arab, Pakistan,\nChinese, Indian and Africa Societies which make special efforts\nto make their members feel at\nhome, and collaborate with the\nI.R.C. and its activities.\nFinally there is the Debating\nSociety, which draws its support\nfrom both inside and outside the\nSocial Clubs and is perhaps the\nmost important society in the col-leg e. Debates are organised between Imperial College and other\nColleges m the University of\nLondon. M. Ps. and other public\nfigures are often invited as guest\nspeakers in particular debates, but\nthere is plenty of opportunity for\nneophytes, beginners classes being\ndeveloped into such a la bary n thine giant that it is quite possible\norganized especially for the pur-pose.\nThe Social Clubs publish a ma-ga zine, SCRUTINY, which appears once a term and which\naffords an opportunity to air your\nviews on religion, politics and the\nrest. Watch out for it.\nHow does one join the club of\nyour choice? The most convenient time is on Freshers' Day, when\nnearly all the clubs in the college\nhold stalls in the Union proclaiming themselves and their activities,\nand when they will be only too\nhappy to enrol you. Alternatively you can turn up to your\nclub's Freshers' Reception, or you\ncan write to the.Hon. Secretary\nof your club care of the letter\nrack in the lower Union lounge.\nA full list of Social Clubs with\ntheir aims and objects appears in\nthe Blue Book.\nD.E.P. IMPERIAL COLLEGE The Liberal Society at Imperial\nCollege offers to all students an\nopportunity for radical and progressive thought and discussion.\nFor the coming term, and for the\nrest of the year, we are having a comprehensive programme of\ntalks and discussions, with opportunities for meeting and talking\nto leading Liberal personalities\nand M. Ps. We are affiliated to\nand are taking an active part in\nthe University of London Liberal\nFederation where you will be able\nto meet other Liberals and Radicals. There is also an opportunity\nfor all members to take part in\nthe affairs of the Union of Liberal\nStudents and attending its annual\nconference.\nDuring the year, there are several lighter forms of political\nactivity including a theatre outing,\nwith a dinner in the House of\nI. C.W. A, You may or may not have\nnoticed that there are not very\nmany women students at Imperial\nCollege. Last year we numbered\nabout 125 which is very few when\nscattered throughout all the various departments of the three constituent colleges. I. C.W. A. exists\nso that the women may meet from\ntime to time, and so that their\nopinions on any matter may be\nexpressed, and not lost in the\nmass of male points of view.\nAll women students are automatically members of I. C.W. A. We have one male member elected by us each year, and he is\nknown as Mr. I. C.W. A. There is a lounge in the Union\nbuilding which is solely for the\nuse of Icwarians, and it is here\nthat we hold our general meetings.\nWe shall try to arrange some talks\nthis year on subjects of particular\ninterest to women, and any suggestion on subject matter will be\nmost welcome. Last year we had\ntwo such talks, one on hairdressing and one on cosmetics. At\nChristmas time we have an old\nfolks party for elderly people in\nthe district. In the Easter term\nwe run a Hop and hold our annual\nformal Dinner and Dance.\nOur Sports 'Club, I.C. W.S.C. runs teams for hockey, netball,\nsquash, table-tennis, ten is, swimming and athletics. The standards\nvary considerably and anyone at\nall keen here will be most welcome to join in. Last year twelve\nmeme be rs of the Club went to\nHolland for a one week's sports\ntour, which was great fun.\nI. C.W. A. has its own notice\nboard beside the I.C. WiA. lounge,\nand all notices of meetings, sports\nteams, etc. appear on this board.\nWe hope to see all the Freshers\nat the reception, and that you will\njoin in the activities of the as soci ation, which can. thrive only by\nyour interest. It was a good year\nlast year and we hope this year\nwill be even better.\nI. C.W. A. President.\nLIBERAL SOCIETY Commons, and a free Wine and\nCheese party with ULL r. As\nthere will be a General Election in\nthe coming year, plans will be\nmade for interested members of\nthe Society to help with the campaign to send more Liberals to\nWestminster.\nOur first rne e ting is the Freshers' Tea, where you will be able to\nmeet other members of the Society\nat an informal get-together. It\nwill be held in the snack bar on\nThursday October 3rd, starting\nat 5.30 p.m., If you, have not\nalready met us at the Freshers'\nReception, come along to the\nFreshers' Tea. All are welcome.\nAnybody who might like to contact us, please contact our Secretary, Steward Aaron, or the President, Edward Fortune, via the\nletter rack in the Union main\nlounge.\nEDWARD FORTUNE.\nTHE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN IMPERIAL COLLEGE On coming up to Imperial College you will of course be attracted by many of the Clubs and\nSocieties, which provide you with\nan opportunity to take part in\nyour favourite sport or interest.\nIn addition to these Clubs and\nSocieties, you will also find here\nthe existence of the Church.\nPerhaps at home you belonged\nto your local Parish Church.\nYou might have been a member\nof the Parish Youth Club or\nScout Troop, or served at Church\nworship .or sung in the choir.\nYou may also have risen to the\nexalted rank of being a Sidesman\nor a member of your Parochial\nChurch Council! However\nstrong or however weak your link\nwith your Parish may have been,\nwe have pleasure in welcoming\nyou to join the life of the Church\nin the student community of 'this\ncollege.\nIf you are in a Hall of Residence, we trust you will be\nvisited within the next couple of\nweeks by one of the members of\nthe Church Community \u2014 probably one who lives on the same\nfloor as you do. He will hand to\nyou a programme of the activities of the Church, and we hope\nhe will also have a chance to say\na word or two to you as to when\nand where these various activities\ntake place.\nWe are not merely a\" Sunday\nOnly \" Church Community\u2014we\ntry to live out the Faith every\nday of the week, On Sundays\nwe use a church called St. Augustine's, down Queen's Gate, for\na sung Eucharist (Holy Communion) at 9.0 a.m. Here you\nwill have the opportunity of worshipping together around the\nAltar, and after that at 10 a.m. of breakfasting together.\nOn Sunday evenings there will\nbe Evensong at St. Augustine's at\n7.30 p.m., where some of the best\npreachers can be heard. Again,\nafter Evensong, there will be an\nopportunity during tea and biscuits of meeting men and women\nwho not only belong to our col-leg e, but also come from others\nsuch as Queen Elizabeth College,\nRoyal College of Music, Royal\nCollege of Art, College of Estate\nManagement, Chealsea College\nof Science and Battersea College\nof Technology. It has always\nbeen agreed that this Community\nis a vigorous, active and caring\none.\nOur weekly activities will be\nfound on page three of your pro-gram me. You will find members\nof the Church in every year and\nevery department of the college.\nYour Chaplain is the Revd.

The annual programme of' events includes discussions, side-shows, a Hop, and a Dinner. Not only expedition members but also those with a general\ninterest in travel will find much of interest in the talks given about\nvarious exotic parts of the world. The Society publishes its own\njournal \" Exploration Review,\" and a directory of personnel having\nspecial knowledge of a particular country or technique is being pre-pared. Full details of all meetings will be found on the noticeboard\noutside the Concert Hall.\nThe Society should not be confused with the Exploration Board,\nwhich is a staff / studen et committee receiving financial aid from\nthe Union and the Governing\nBody.

However, squares on the hypo tenu ese and ones with rounded corners\nare catered for as the Club enjoys\na well balanced mixture of American, English and Scottish dances,\nplus a few others thrown in for\ngood luck!\nLast year we participated in\nthe University Folk Dance Festival which was attended by some\n700 students from all over Britajn\nat the Seymour Hall. Of the 48\nteams, our college had the largest\nentry of three square sets. This\nyear we again hope to take part in\nthe festival which is to be held at\nSheffield University. The Carnival was no exception to our ac-ti vi ties; the lawn in the Union\nQuad suffered somewhat from our\nefforts, nevertheless an enjoyable\ntime was had by all.

HORSEY,\nformation at the stall on Freshers'\nDay, at the Freshers Meeting, or\nafter any of the regular meetings,\nor else call in at Room 642,\nTizard Hall.\nRECREATION A TI.C. The clubs and societies at Imperial College are divided up into,\nthree groups, the \" Social Clubs \"\n(political and religious), the\n\" Athletic Clubs \" (competitive\nsports) and the \" Recreational\nClubs.\" The \"Social Clubs\"\nwill tell you that you have an obligation to support your religious\nor political views\u2014.they are after\nyour soul! The \" Athletic\nClubs \" will tell you that good\nchaps join this club and that you\nmust train every week\u2014they are\nafter your time ! The \" Recreational Clubs \" offer you the opportunity to do what you like,\nwhen you like and as energetically as you like. For example,\nyou can go gliding or pot holing, climb mountains or play chess,\nwear an aqualung or dancing\nshoes and relax at billiards or\nbridge. Many of these clubs\nhave a reputation that spreads\nbeyond the college, the Underwater club has had several expeditions working on underwater\ngeology and archeology, the\nMountaineering club this year\nhad an expedition to Greenland\nand climbed so many new peaks\n(well over 20) that nobody seems\nto have sorted out the exact num-ber. On a gliding club expedition to the Alps a member of I.C. made the first ever glider crossing of the Matterhorn (and back\nin time for tea!) and on the\nhome front the productions of\nthe Dramatic Society and Musical Society always draw large\naudiences.\nThese are some of the more\nspectacular achievements of the\n\" Recreational Clubs\" but the\nreal strength of the \"Recrea-t ional Clubs \" are those that exist\nso that people with a common interest can get together and have\nfacilities for their hop by whether\nthey want chess boards or photographic darkrooms.\nYou will find a list of the \" Recreational Clubs \" in your blue\nUnion handbook and a note in\nthe Union rack to the secretary\nof any club that interests you will\nbring you all the information\nabout joining that club.\nR.M. Henson.\nTHE II fi WELLS\nSOCIETY\nH.G. Wells, the Father of\nScience Fiction, is one of EC's, most distinguished alumni, and it\nis fitting that a new society being\nlaunched in the college this term\nshould bear his name. Wells\nwas a man of many parts\u2014Fabian, populariser of science, ra-tion a list, advocate of World Government, u topographer, champion\nof birth control, critic of racial is m, writer of Science Fiction\u2014so the\nsociety has a wide choice of topics\nfor meetings.\nThe society will have, broadly\nspeaking, three main aims. First,\nto provide its members with the\nopportunity to hear about interesting work being undertaken in\nfields of science and technology\nother than their own. Secondly,\nto consider the philosophical and\nsociological implications of certain scientific developments.\nThirdly, to examine subjects\nwhich are on the borderline between science fiction and science\nfact, and to enjoy Science Fiction\n\" per se.\"\nSeveral of the meetings arranged\nfor this term have a Science Fiction flavour; indeed, even the\nstraightforward scientific subjects\nseem to have romance back-grounds. The talks on \" Lasers \"\n(Oct. 14) and \" Strange Ant Colonies \" (Nov. 4) bring to mind the\ndeath-ray machines and predatory\ninsects of the more exp tic scientific romances, while the talks on\n\"The Mechanism of Brainwashing\nand Conversion\" (Oct. 21) and\n\" DNA and RNA\"( Nov. 18)\nlook into the possibilities respectively of \" 1894 \" and \" Brave\nNew World.\" Even the talk on\n\" Operation Mohole \" (Nov. 25)\nmight be taken as a description of\na\" Journey to the Centre of the\nEarth,\" and Mr. Cowan's talk on\nDec. 2, \" The Stimulation of Living Processes\" should provide\nplenty of food for thought and for\ndiscussion.\nIn addition to these talks, there\nis to be a Symposium on \" Getting\nOff the Moon \" (Nov. 11) chaired\nby Professor H. Elliot of our\nPhysics Dept. and led by experts\nwho are currently considering the\nproblem, and a showing of the\nclassic Science Fiction film \" The\nShape of Things to Come \" (Oct.\n28), scripted by Wells.\nThe society's opening meeting,\non Oct. 7, will be about Wells\nhimself-his education at Imperial\nCollege under Huxley and his\nvaried career; it will be addressed\nby Professor G.E. G. Catlin,\nphilosopher and political scientist,\na leading left wing in tell ece tu al, who knew Wells personally, and\nwho was co-founder with him of\nThe Realist -Magazine.\" The\ninformal meetings over coffee\nwhich will follow this talk and all\nothers should provide members\nwith a splendid opportunity to\ndiscuss the subjects with the\nspeakers and with the teaching\nstaff of the college.\nMONDAY NIGHT IS WELLS SOC NIGHT\nThe first meeting of\nTHE H.G.

London EC4.\nOur President this year is a particularly capable individual.\nFull of determination, he is also\nvery conscientious, hard-working\nand ambitious but perhaps ?, little\ntoo self-assured. In his two years\nat I.C. Dave Watson has had very\nlittle to do with the handling of\nUnion business (except as a member of the RCC) and thus as an\nobserver he has been able to make\na critical study of the many aspects of Union management without allowing himself to be drawn\ninto the petty politics of any social\nclique. With this valuable experience and his own experiences of\nuniversity life at Cambridge,\ncombined with a first class brain,\nDave has great potential and\nshould be able to instill fresh ideas\ninto his approach to Union problems with a relatively unbiased\nmind.\nTwenty-three years old, Dave\nWatson hails from Belfast. In\n1958 Dave went up to St.Catharine's College Cambridge to read\nMathematics and Physics. After\ngraduating with a double-first, he\ncame to I.C. to pursue research in\nTheoretical Physics. Whilst at\nCambridge, Dave was an active\nmember of the Labour Club and\nhe also edited his College maga-zine. Much of his spare time,\nhowever, was spent with the John\nRay Society, of which he was both\nSecretary and President in turn\nwhich was concerned in studying\nthe impact of Science on Society.\nDave finds his relaxation in the\nmountains. He has always been a keen fall walker but only started\nrock climbing during his last year\nat Cambridge. At I.C. he quickly\nbecame recognised in the Mountaineering Club as a very \" hard \"\nclimber, all this despite injuries\nsustained in a road accident the\nsame year. The following year he\nwas elected its President and\nduring this period the standard of\nclimbing in the club reached a new peak. The year culminated\nin an expedition to the Stavning\nAlps, East Greenland when 18\nnew peaks were scaled for the first\ntime. Constantly faced with\ntransport difficulties on club\nmeets, Dave was not prepared to\nlet matters lie. Through the initiative of the Caving Club, he supervised the purchase of a30 cw t. Austin Van for the Mountaineering, Underwater and Caving\nClubs.\nDave first left his mark in Union\naffairs during the initial NUS debate and again during the final debate when speaking out against\naffiliation to.v NUS. His efforts\nbrought him into the running as a candidate for President and his\nsuccess against better known opponents came as a surprise to\nmany people, s Dave is a great believer in the\nrights of the individual and hates\nunfair treatment of any kind. He\ncan be fully relied upon to safeguard the rights of the student\nbody as well. His term of office\nis faced with many interesting\nproblems, especially now that possession has been taken of the new\nSouth Side facilities. I have no\ndoubt that Dave's determination\nand persistence will be felt in\nmany circles throughout this year.\nAs President, his contribution to\nI.C. will be undoubtedly of great\nvalue. H. T.L.

Many acres of land in the heart of London\nhave been vacated and made available to the College ; some seventeen\nmillion pounds worth of buildings have been erected ; the number\nof staff and students has almost doubled. These are bare facts which\ncannot attempt to do justice to a programme in which I.C., as the\nspearhead of a national effort to expand and improve scientific e duca tion, has been transformed almost beyond recognition.\nThis expansion has by no\nmeans been confined to the academic departments\u2014indeed the\nneed for providing numerous\nother amenities has been clearly\nroc ogni zed from the start. Hostels, refectories, playing fields\nand so on have been accorded\nhigh priority.\nThe central figure in this immense effort is you, the student,\nand the central problem your\neducation. Society holds you and\nyour ability in high esteem, investing heavily in your education,\nsparing itself no effort and refusing to offer anything but the best.\nIt has provided you with all the\nfacilities you could reasonably ask\nGORDON LOWE S The ideal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brampton Arcade,\nKnhjhtsbridge, S.W.3 KEN 4494/5/6\nfor, and done this with unquestioning faith and confidence.\nAll this will be of no avail if\nyou, as an individual, do not hold\nthe same high opinion of yourself\nas society does. You must have\nconfidence in your own ability,\nfor without it you won't achieve\nanything worthwhile in any of the\ncircles in which you will be m ov ing. One can take a horse to\nthe water, but if it does not believe it has the ability to drink,\nwill not do anyone, least of all the\nhorse much good.\nTfiis is the more necessary because at I.C. you will not be\nspoon-fed. You are left, as you\nshould be, to develop your own\ninterests and to fend for yourself\nin all that you do. In your department you must have self-confidence to apply yourself methodically and discerning ly to your\nwork. And in other fields you\nmust have the self-confidence to\nplay an active part.\nAll the facilities of the Union\nare at your disposal\u2014it is your\nUnion, as it is your College. I urge you to learn what it has to\noffer and how it operates. If you\ndevelop an active interest in any\none of its multi fe rous activities\nyou will soon come to feel much\nmore at home in the College.\nThe Union has grown stronger\nand more diversified within the\nCollege, but there is still much\nroom for improvement. I hope\nyou will make your own con tri Cont on page 4\nRoyal Visit Oct Sth\nOn Tuesday, 8th October, at 2.45 p.m. Her Royal Highness\nPrincess Margaret, accompanied by Lord Snowdon, will visit the\nCollege to open The South Sides Hall of Residence Building.\nOn her arrival, Her Royal Highness will be received by the\nChairman of the Governing Body, Sir Roger Makins and the Rector,\nSir Patrick Linstead. After presentations Her Royal Highness will\nproceed by the central entrance to the main Dining Room.- There\nthree brief speeches will be made, Her Royal Highness officially\ndeclaring the-building open. After this short ceremony the Princess\nwill make a short tour of the Gallery Floor of Falmouth Hall, during\nwhich she will be shown Student Rooms on one of the staircases, and\nthen the Common Rooms on the Ground Floor.\nAfter this tour Her Royal Highness will leave the building unveiling a plaque commemorating the occasion just outside the main\nentrance before briefly visiting the Civil and Electrical Departments.\nShe will then have tea at 170 Queens Gate.\n350 guests have been invited to attend the opening ceremony\ning the arrival and departure of Her Royal Highness in Princes\nstudents who usually frequent the Common Rooms will be present\nin reasonable numbers. There will also be opportunities of watch-including about 75 students. During the tour it is hoped that those\nGardens and it is hoped that as many as possible will turn up there,\nSTOP PRESS\nTUES.

Last years\nspeakers included Raymond Baxter and Sydney Allard. We also\nmake one or more visits to Car\nFactories etc. during the year.\nThe first meeting of the Club is\non Friday, October 11th at 5.15\np.m. in room 542 of the Mech.\nEng. Dept. in City, and Guilds\nCollege. The programme will include a film on the development\nof formula Junior engines from\nthe Ford 105E engine,\nAs fresher s of Imperial College you have taken the opportunity to benefit from an excellent scientific training but, if you\ndo not already know, you will\nsoon realise that there is a lot\nmore to University life than lectures and labs. There is opportunity to meet people ; to establish new acquaintances ; to make\nnew friends. There is opportunity through joining college\nsocieties to pursue your own\nspecial likes and interests. Specifically, there is now on Freshers'\nDay or soon after opportunity\nto join the I.C. Huxley Society.\nThis is the Humanist Society of\nthe college and\u2014as such\u2014it provides everyone who joins with\nopportunities to hear well-known\nlecturers, authors, radio and television speakers, and philosophers\ntalk on subjects concerned with\nmorality, religion and philo-soph y. While enjoying coffee\nafter these meetings opportunity\nis provided for discussion with\nthese great speakers. In less formal discussion meetings there is\nopportunity to voice your\nopinion among fellow students of\nsimilar outlook\u2014.and, when we\nmeet with other college societies,\namong students with far differing\nideas and thoughts. Further,\nthrough the Huxley Society there\nare opportunities to attend conferences organised by larger\nHumanist organisations and, in-c ident ly, the Monthly News and\nNotes published by the Ethical\nUnion is provided free to mem-be rs. There are plans this year\nto invite students from other colleges to our meetings in the hope\nof establishing a link with other\nHumanist Societies. (Psst!\n\" Other\" colleges have more\nthan a handful of the opposite\nsex\u2014-i.e., females, and the \"link\"\nis, we hope, a social one). All this and more is there for the\nprice of 1/6 per session. Take\nthis opportunity now\u2014he \" in it\" from the start. Join on\nFreshers' Day or at the Huxley\nSociety's Freshers' Tea (Fri., 4th October, 5.30, upper Refectory)\nor by application stating name\nand department to the Secretary\nof the Huxley Society, c/o The\nUnion Rack. The opportunity is\nthere\u2014we can do no more,\nAN\nOPEN\nINVITATION\nThe idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"
