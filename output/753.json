    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday November 7th198612 The Mission\nThere is usually one movie each year\nwhich attracts the sort of people\nwho rarely go to the cinema but\nthink that they 'ought' to see it so\nthat they can bore their friends by\ntalking about it at dinner parties.\n\"The Mission\" is it!\nDirector Roland Jaffe has\nattempted to make an epic film on\nthe scale of 'El Cid' and 'Ben Hur'.\nVisually the film is a masterpiece,\nevery frame would make a spectacular still photograph but\nunfortunately the Amazon was\nfilmed almost as well a few years ago\nin \"The Emerald Forest\" and so\nlooks all too familiar. The script was\nwritten by Robert Bolt whose\nprevious works include \" Dr. Zhivago\" and \" A Man for All\nSeasons\", however most of the two\nhours were dialogue less and lots of\npained expressions from Jeremy\nIrons and heavy music could not\nmake up for this gaping hole. What\nlines there were were frequently over\nblown and self-conscious,\ncompletely wasting all of Robert de\nNiro's phenomenal talent and\nremoving most of the story's credibility.\nCharacterisation is sacrificed for\nspectacle, by the end I had no\ninterest or sympathy in the\npro tag an is ts, even the sight of de\nNiro getting blasted left me totally\nunmoved! I fail completely to see\nhow anybody could find the film\npowerful, it is male-orientated with\nvirtually no female characters which\nis perhaps why I was left cold by the\nend.\nIf the hype is to be believed, the\nfuture of the (yawn, yawn....) British\nFilm Industry and Goldcrest\ndepends on the \"The Mission\"\nfollowing the failure of\n\"Revolution\" and \"Absolute\nBeginners\". Any company that\nfinances three films, all with the\nsame faults, deserves to go bust.\nHowever,I may be over-critical and\nso you ought to go and make up\nyour own mind.\nLiz Holford\n4\n/ t% The Mission II\n\"The Mission\" is a film made by\npeople with very impressive\npedigrees, the director Roland\nJoffe's previous film was \"The\nKilling Fields\", screenwriter\nRichard Bolt was responsible for \"A Man for All Seasons\" and the music\nis by Ennio Morricane, then there is\nthe impressive cast consisting of\nRobert de Niro and Jeremy Irons\namongst others. Unfortunately\nhowever the whole is less than the\nsum of the parts.\nThe mission in question is a Jesuit\noutpost in 18th century South\nAmerica which becomes the object\nof a political struggle between the\nSpanish and Portuguese govern-men ts.A Pope's envoy (Ray\nMcAnally) is sent to assess the\nsituation and determine the best\ncourse of action. In charge of the\nmission is a dedicated pacifist,\nJeremy Irons, w L;\"'.et ermine d that the surrounding area, including\nthe mission, should not fall into the\nhands of the Portuguese who still\npractice slavery. Should the mission\nresist at all, the whole future of the\nJesuit movement throughout\nEurope would be jeo pardi sed, thus\nthe scene is set for the sort of rural\ndilemma that both Joffe and Bolt\nrevel in.\nThe acting is of the highest\nstandard, Robert de Niro, in spite of\nbeing rather out of place in a historical film, being a very modern\nactor, is nevertheless one of the\nfinest actors alive, and Jeremy Irons\nis magnificent as the gentle, caring\npriest. But above both of these is the\nscene stealing Ray McAnally who\nplays the Pope's envoy charged with\nthe difficult task of conveying a decision against his own wishes as a result of distant European politics.\nHe is brilliant at expressing both the\nawe he feels on sighting the\nunexpected splendour of the\n\"savages\" and the regret in his task.\nRoland Joffe's direction is\nunobtrusive and, in spite of a few\nlabour ed symbolism s, virtually\nfaultless unlike Chris Menges\nphotography which is faultless.\nJoffe's self confessed aim, and an\nentirely defensible one at that, is to\nplace entertainment above historical\nfact, the events of the period merely\nprovide a basis for a good story. One\nmajor flaw with this film is that the\nIndians themselves are not given\nsufficient individual characteristics\nin order that the audience can\nidentify more readily with their\nplight such that the denouement is\nas emotive as it should be in spite of\nsome photojournalist composition\nby Menges. The film however is well\nworth seeing and has the added\npurpose of drawing attention to the\nplight of these people who up to ten\nyears ago were still being traded as\nslaves.\nWOMAG (The Women's media\nAction Group) is organizing a survey of the media this weekend in\norder to determine the scale of\ncurrent advertising that could be\nconsidered sexist or offensive to\nwomen.\nWOMAG wants women in\nLondon to scour publications,\ntelevision, radio and cinema\nadvertising for potentially\ndegrading material and to get in\ntouch with them, they in turn will\npass complaints on to the\nAdvertising Standards Authority.\nIf you wish to participate cut out\nthe ad and record the publication,\ndate and page number, or, if it was\non television record, the channel\nand time of broadcast. Also please\ndescribe briefly why you consider it\noffensive. WOMAG can be\ncontacted directly at 48 William IV\nSt., London. WC2. (Tel:01-836-6081) or via Liz Holford in the\n'Felix' office.\nAlmost every women has\ncomplained of sexist advertising at\nsome time or another, now is your\nchance to do something about it!\n\n"

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday November 7th19862 GUC Stupidity\nDear Sir,\nI could hardly believe the degree\nof stupidity and sheer lack of\nintelligence displayed by the UL U General Union Council as reported\nin FELIX last week. Their criticism\nof the Government's \"Freedom of\nSpeech\" clause leads me to conclude\nthat they would perhaps quite like to\nlive under a totalitarian dictatorship, in which some Big\nBrother decides who is allowed to\nair their views and who isn't. The only way in which the clause\nwill \"affect their (the Unions') rights\nto represent the views of a great deal\nof their members\" will be to\nIMPROVE that representation. If\nmore students are free to air their\nviews to the Union, then the\nrepresentation can only become\nmore accurate. Of course it will\njeo pardi se\" no platform\" policies\u2014that is exactly what it is\nmeant to do. Many student unions\nprevent large numbers of their\nmembers (including Conservatives,\nJews and anyone deemed by the\nUnion to be \"sexist\") from speaking\nat union meetings and writing in\nunion publications. The sooner this\nis stopped the better.\nThere is no reason why students\nshould be subjected to the incessant\nflow of extreme left-wing\npropaganda which most unions\npour out, and from which we at\nImperial are, thankfully, relatively\ninsulated. I have no objection to left-wing propaganda as long as there is\nan equal volume of right-wing\npropaganda, and students are left to\nmake up their own minds. This is\nwhat the \"Freedom of Speech\"\nclause in the Education Bill is for.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Ranson\nMechanical Engineering 2\nPublic Order\nBill\nDear Sir,\nYour report of the recent UL U GUC meeting (Felix 752) left me\nconcerned about the thinking within\nthe council. You report that the\nPublic Order Bill was criticised as\nbeing a breach of democratic\nfreedom. Leaving aside the accuracy\nor otherwise of this belief, the\nGUC'S support for democracy is\nencouraging; in the next paragraph,\nhowever, we are told that the\n'freedom of speech' claim in the\nEducation Bill was also criticised, as\nthe council \"felt that this would\njeo pardi se Student Unions' 'no\nplatform' policies.\" Yet surely these\npolicies are a breach of the\ndemocratic freedom the GUC is so\nkeen to uphold? Obviously the\nGUC is in favour of democratic\nfreedom only as long as it is in its\nown interest\u2014 a strange kind of\ndemocracy!\nThis hypocritical attitude is also\nrife within the NUS, which some\nmembers of College think we should\nrejoin. Hopefully the vast majority\nof IC students are sensible enough\nto realise that we have no need to be\npart of this undemocratic\norganisation or its discriminate\npolicies.\nYours faithfully,\nPeter Clark\nElectrical Engineering 2\nSenseless\nPolicy\nDear Sir,\nIt seems as though UL U has done\nit again: agreed on a senseless policy\nagainst the best interests of students\nfor totally illogical reasons. I speak\nof the decision, made at the GU C meeting reported in FELIX last\nweek, to oppose the introduction of\nstudent loans on the grounds that\nthey would jeo pardi se students from\nlow income brackets.\nThe whole point of loans is to put\neveryone on an equal footing. Those\nfrom low income backgrounds who\nhave already shown the\ndetermination and ability to\ncontinue their education in their\ndesire for a better career would be in\nthe same position as those whose\nLEA has, under the present system\ndecreed that their parents can afford\n\u00a3300, \u00a3500, or \u00a3700 a term, but do\nnot actually receive the full parental\ncontribution.\nAt the moment these students end\nup even poorer than a student on a \"Full Grant\", (the value of which\nhas fallen to an intolerably low level,\nthanks to the inability of the NUS to\nrepresent students' interests\neffectively.)\nOne understandable reservation\npeople have about loans is the threat\nof \"a black cloud of debt.\" This,\ntoo, is unfounded. The proposals\nare for a government supported\nloan to be paid off at very low\ninterest rates as the graduate's career develops. Why should this\nblack cloud hang over the heads of\nthe predominantly low income,\nworking class tax-payers ,while the\ntypical middle-class student\nindulges itself (I'm not sexist) in\ncopious quantities of beer?\nIf you are not convinced by the\ndirect benefits of grants, consider\nthe more frequent criticisms of\nUniversities. Far too many students\nfrom an all-too-easy middle-class\nbackground fall into a university\neducation purely as a continuation\nof school. Given a degree of\nfinancial responsibility, they might\nthink a little harder about what is\nright for them, and how best to\nachieve it, avoiding a potential\ncollege drop-out in the process. We\nall know that degree courses often\nhave little relevance to the real\nworld. A loan system would\nincrease the pressure on Universities\nto develop the right courses for\nindustry and commerce, and to\ncreate a market for their invaluable\narts and classics qualifications.\nColin Trotman,\nMechanical Engineering 2.\nOutdated and\nsexist\nDear Editor,\nI read with interest the article in\nlast week's FELIX regarding Jane\nSpiegel's proposal for aUG M emergency motion. The motion\nurges the banning of CCU drinking\nclubs from using college facilities on\nthe grounds that they are \"outdated\nand sexist\".\nMy attention was then drawn to\nanother article regarding Women in\nScience and Techn.' i \u00abrv 'WIST), a society, and I quote the article, \"run\nby women for women students\". Is\nMs. Spiegel a member of this society\nor does she consider that it too\nshould be banned for being sexist?\nI have no personal interest in\neither the C CU drinking clubs or\nWIST, but I do feel that this motion\nis yet another example of the\nhypocrisy that we have come to\nexpect from feminists.\nAs a final thought, might it not be\nreasonable to suggest that Women\nin Science and Technology (WIST)\nchange its name to Persons in\nScience and Technology!!\nYours sincerely,\nJonathan Turner\nMechanical Engineering 3\nCorrection\nThe date of the 150th anniversary celebration\nreferred to in Mrs. Ash's article (FELIX 752, page\n4) should have read July\n10th and not July 12th.

It is encouraging,\nhowever, to have aUG M where\nbanal humour gives way to serious\ndebate. Though the voting figures\nshow the attend en ce at that stage to\nbe slightly below the quorum of 300,\nall interested parties seemed keen to\ntake advantage of an acceptably\nrepresentative forum.\nThe Barclays issue will, I suspect,\nreappear sometime in the future in\namended form. I am not in a position to dispute any of the\ninformation presented by John\nMartin, or for that matter Shaun\nDunlop, but I still contest much of\nJohn's argument. He went to\nsignificant lengths on Tuesday to\nstress Barclay's concern for the nonwhites in South Africa, including\nthe donation of a significant\npercentage of their profits to\noppressed groups. Praiseworthy\naction, I agree, but it is misleading to\nthink that Barclays has any concern\nfor the people of South Africa. Like\nany of the banks, or any large\nbusiness concern, their primary goal\nis profit, and South Africa with its\nmassive mineral wealth is a profitable country for bankers.\nBarclays may have been 'generous'\nto blacks, and may have broken\nSouth African laws to employ them\nbut this is window-dressing; to\npretend that it is anything else is\nnaive in the extreme. The issue is\nstraightforward; Barclays is a significant financial organisation in\na country with a racist government,\nand as such is a supporter of the\nregime. The other high street banks,\nI know, also have interests in South\nAfrica, and the reason is the same:\nfinancial gain. Their involvement\ndoes nothing to absolve Barclays,\nwhich is simply the bank with the\nheaviest commitment, and as such\ndeserves the attention of\norganisations keen to see the\ndestruction of the apartheid system.\nJohn also said at the U GM that\nBarclays (in Britain) was not directly\nconnected with Barclays National\n(in South Africa). This argument\nimplies that he does not condone\nBarclays involvement.\nI appreciate the philosophy that\napartheid can be changed from\nwithin, but Barclays Bank are not\ninterested in leading the way, only in\nthe protection of their financial\ninterests.\nOld School Ties\nThe motion on \"the Image of\nImperial College Union\" was\npartially successful from the point of\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion FELIX, Friday November 7th198615 The Chain An opinion article by Roger Wilson\nOn Saturday 1st November the\nLinks Club held its 60th Anniversary Ball in the Main\nDining Hall in the Sherfield\nBuilding.\nThis was the culmination of 2\nyears of preparations by the College\nmembers of the club, and was\nattended by 210 people. Links Club\nmembers and their guests\nrepresenting every decade of the\nClub's history came from Hong\nKong, New York, Pakistan and all\nparts of Europe to celebrate the\ncontinued strength of the club and\nto toast its honourable intentions:\n\"The promotion of friendship\nand good fellowship amongst the\nmembers of the club,both at college\nand for years to come.\"\nFollowing the dinner a toast to\nthe club was proposed by Stephen\nBishop (C&G President 1982-83).\nThis was then replied to by Peter\nHarding who spoke of his days at\ncollege during the war and his\nexperiences of having met members\nof the club on his travels all over the\nworld.\nA toast to the guests was made by\nRoger Wilson, welcoming them on\nbehalf of the club. This was replied\nto by Maria O 'Donnell (C&G Hon.\nSec. 1969/70) wife of past C&G President Chris O 'Donnell. Maria's speech was one of the highlights of\nthe evening, firstly s at i rising the\nmarriage of a man and his pewter\npot and then paying tribute to the\nClub for the fellowship that must\nexist within it to draw back so many\nmembers of all ages from all parts of\nthe world.\nAt this point the formal part of\nthe evening was over and the\nchampagne corks popped to mark\nthe Club's entry into its seventh\ndecade.\nThe party then really began as a steel band got people up and\ndancing. At one point a huge conga\nwound its way around the Hall,\nthrough the kitchens and through\nthe ante-room as well.\nThe music continued with an\nhours set from a traditional jazz\nband. Younger members were put\nto shame by \"Bert\" Grace, the\noldest member present, and his wife\nas they quick stepped around the\ndancefloor in a faultless\ndemonstration.\nA further hour from each of the\nbands saw only the fittest left on\ntheir feet at the end of a memorable\nevening.\nWriting this as I do before the\noutcome of Tuesdays U GM motion\nconcerning the three tie clubs I can\nonly say that I was proud to have\nhad the honour of Chairing this Ball\nand I hope that some of the friends I met on Saturday night will be still\nwith me for the Club's next\nanniversary.\nMy final point is that I feel sad\nthat Imperial College Union should\nfeel that it wants to ban any club\nthat can retain links with college\nmembers from over the past ninety\nyears; all of whom in their day have\ngiven good service to both City and\nGuilds and Imperial Colleges.\nHon.

    "content": "Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday November 7th1986 President's Piece\nUGM\nThis piece of prose will probably\nbe completely incoherent and\nunintelligible. Why? Because I am\nstill in a state of shock after a quo rate and successful U GM. The\nshock probably accounts for the fact\nthat I was Rather Nasty to all the\npeople who left before the reports. I was enjoying myself so much I didn't realise it was 2.30 and people\nhad lectures and labs to go to. Please\naccept my grovelling apologies; and\nif anyone wants to ask me about my\nreport, feel free to come and do so.\nGenerally, it was very\nencouraging to see that we can have\na reasonable debate and a close vote\non issues both inside and \"outside\"\nCollege. I hope the rest of this year's UGM's are as good.\nUnion Office\nIf you've tried to visit the office in\nthe morning this week you'll have\nfound that the door was locked.\nUnfortunately we've had to keep the\noffice shut until 11am due to the\namount of administrative work to\nget through. This is partially due to\nthe backlog caused by Jen and Pat\nhaving to take weeks off\nunexpectedly. However we may\nhave to carry on with this\narrangement because of the\nincreased workload on the staff and\nsabbaticals since the Union took on\nthe bar. Please bear with us while we\nget things sorted out.\nIt appears that the time has come\nto consider re-organising the Union;\nredistributing the work between the\nofficers and possibly taking on a new sabbatical or member of staff.\nAnyone who wants to join in\ndiscussions about the re-organisations options, let me know.\nI'd like to get a firm proposal\ntogether by the end of January.\nUnion Bar and Lounge Bar\nBy the time you read this the new\nmusic system will be installed in the\nLounge Bar. Bring your own\ncompilation tapes along and listen\nwhile you eat and drink.\nThere are now \"happy hours\",\nwith a beer at reduced price,\nbetween 7.00 and 8.30 every\nTuesday and Thursday in the Union\nBar.\nThere's a band\u2014'Reynard's Gauntlet'\u2014playing in the Lounge\nBar tomorrow night; and there's still\ntime to enter a team from your\ndepartmental year for the Darts\nContest (eight people including at\nleast one woman). See Kevin in the\nUnion bar for details.\nHuman Rights Week\nThanks to everyone who\norganised or took part in Human\nRights week events, especially\nSimon Bosher and Mark Cottle.\nHRW is a wonderful idea; I hope it\nwill continue to expand over the\ncoming years. By the way, the\ncollection for Amnesty International at Tuesday'sU GM raised\nabout \u00a350.\nComplaint\nWhoever damaged the TV in the\nLounge Bar I hope you're proud of\nyourself. Next time maybe you'll\nelectrocute yourself in the process.\nChristine\nPhoenix Centenary Dinner\nFr.^dy 28th November\n170 Queens Gate\nDCost: \u00b015\nDDress: Black tie or lounge suit\nDTickets from FELIX Office\nCOLLEGE CHRISTMAS\nDINNER\nThursday 11 December 1986\nCost to students: \u00a310.00 per head, including\nwines\nDress: Dinner Jacket or Dark Lounge Suit\nBookings open in Union Office at 12 noon, Friday 14\nNovember\nClosing date: 12 noon Friday 5th December\nSee Pat\nU GM Sketch\nSurprise followed surprise at\nTuesday'sU GM, with the first\nmajor one being the turnout of 300\nplus \u2014 a quo rate meeting. The\naudience may have dared to be\ndifferent, but they only seemed to\nwant to dare until 2.30 when the labs\nopened again with the first\nprocedural motion from Douglas\nEarl who wanted to get the motions\nover with because he wanted to\nleave early. And so the reports were\nshuffled back out of sight as the\ncircus rolled onto its first\nconfrontation.\nAfraid that Simon Bosher might\nhave to make a speech, the first\nmotion of the day on adopting Ivan\nStarovoit as IC's own prisoner was\npassed without discussion. A sigh of\nrelief was breathed until the\ninfamous 'Tie Clubs Motion'\nbrought out a rash of extreme\nhyperbole. Hon Sec Dave Colley\nmade the first gaff of the day as he\ndefended 22, Links and Chaps with\nthe surprising revelation that these\nclubs ran the Union contrary to the\ngeneral impression that it is in fact\nrun by the Exec. The unfortunate\nGutman was sent to bed without\nsupper by Christine and Jackie for\nthat one. Gareth Fish seemed to be\nunder the impression that because\nthe somewhat 'left of centre' LSE\nhad single sex tie-clubs, it was\nalright for IC. In the meantime the\nproponents of the motion seemed to\nbe more concerned with how the\nsystem would look in the Guardian\nthan in the real merits of enforcing\nthe admission of women into the\nclubs.\nWith the defeat of that motion,\ncame that old chestnut, the Barclays\nMotion. Nervous eyes surveyed the\nterritory, making sure that the\nmagic 300 was still there, as Shaun\nDunlop launched into reiterating\nthe content of the motion at great\nlength. A curious time dilation effect\ncame into play at this point, causing\nthe supposed two-minute long\nspeeches to be stretched out to five\nor more. It was fortunate that the\nmotion was not written with a impenetrable Newcastle accent\nitself. The motion was countered at\nequal length by John Martin, trying\nto score social awareness points by\nwearing a Solidarnosc tee-shirt but\nhis awareness failed significantly\nwith the line \"Barclays National has\nno financial connection with\nBarclays Bank.\"\nOnce that motion had been\ndefeated the audience suddenly\nrealised that it was time for lectures\nto begin again. The various\nmembers of the front table tried to\nshout out that there were still\nexciting things like the reports and\nratifying some elections. Somehow\nthat did not seem to compete with\nproblem sheets and they all l filed\nout, to leave a few diehards behind.\nChristine had a moan at people who\ndidn't care what she did in a fit of subtlety then apologised after\nrealising what time it was. And so\nwith the shattered remains of an\naudience the second U GM finally\nfaded away with the vow to do all\nthe elections properly next time,\nwhen there were a few more people\nleft.\n\n"

FELIX, Friday November 7th19865 The State Of\nThe Union\nRCS President Simon Singh\ndiscusses how IC has changed in\nrecent years and looks at the current\nstate of the Union\nI was a pre-punk kid. All of final\nyear students at I.C. are a result of\nthe na ff macho glam-rock era ofthe\nearly and mid-seventies. We lack\nstyle and sophistication, and yet we\npossess all the qualities that our\nchild-hood heroes preached.\nThis year's Freshers are derived\nfrom a different cultural source.\nThey grew up under the influence of\nthe New Romantics, the Gender\nBenders, and the post-punk\npoliticians. Male rock stars no\nlonger conformed to the masculine\nnorms but were rather more\ndiminutive in stature and less\na gres sive in attitude. Posturing and\ngesturing was replaced by\npost ul ation and gesticulation.\nWhat's all this got to do with the\nstate of the Unions? Let's take our\nillustrious college back to the\nhalcyon days of 1975. The college\nand the RSM were perfect for\nkeeping the students happy. There is\nnothing like the atmosphere when a dozen guys have worked all\nmorning to get Jez into a fit state\nand then go on a trip out. The air is\nthick with bravado and the unity\nand the comradeship evoked is\nsomething special.\nLet's go back to today. It's November 1986, Monday 24th and\nthe male:female ratio is now finite.\nWomen are here in much greater\nnumbers than ever before and their\nrole within this college is significant.\nThe temperament of the average\nmale is somewhat milder. Social\nattitudes have meant that the\nmasculine image is now less well\ndefined and the necessity to be big,\nand butch is now no longer a necessity. The CCUs, however,\nappear to have failed in registering\n'The air is thick with bravado,\nand the coma rde ship is\nsomething special\"\nwas predominantly male to a much\ngreater extent then it is today and\nthose gentlemen who studied here\nlooked to their CC Us for entertainment. Men were men, and\nCCUs were CCUs. Activities such as\nmascot ry, Jez, Rag and drinking did\nmuch to develop a spirit of\ncamaraderie. Men participated in\nevents which conjured up an\natmosphere of the army life: \"we're\nall in this together lads.\" RCS, C&G this shift in character. Recent years\nhave seen the CCUs continue to\ncater for the pre-punk brigade, with\nthe majority of events intended to\nplease the masculine element. This is\nwhy resentment of the Unions by\nsome students has grown, and\nrecruitment of new blood has\nbecome so difficult.\nBut fear ye not personages of little\nfaith for the times they are a chang in', the tides they are a turnin',\nand the hamsters they are pro duc in': In my opinion RCS and Guilds\nhave begun to metamorphose. I was\nelected on the grounds that things\nwould change and indeed I believe\nthat this years first years see the RCS\nas being a worthwhile organisation\nwith activities ranging from Rocky\nHorror to Jez and the Brighton\nRun, and from Broadsheet to the\nclubs and societies. Life's wonderful\nand sun's shining and the\nham pst ers are still rapidly\nmultiplying....but there is one flaw.\nThe first years are an unbiased\ngroup viewing the CCUs from\nafresh, the rest of college has built\nup one or two years of prejudice and\na belief that the CCUs have changed\nis rare. Unless the rest of college\ngives the CCUs a chance this year\nthe enthusiasm of the Freshers will\nbe quenched. Things are developing\nand the first year's are providing the\nimpetus but there will have to be a time when a college-wide backing is\ngoing to be required.\nIf you are a keen first year stay\nkeen and back the CCU events, if\nyou are despondent second/third\nyear give us a fair chance.\nJust in case you think that the\nt radio nal CCU activities are going\nto suffer under this new camp\nregime then once again fear ye not.\nJez, mascot ry, rag etc. are all being\nsupported to an extent far greater\nthan in recent years-in fact its\nprobably true to say that they are\nthriving.\nUlU travel\nTwice the size \u2014\nTwice the service\nCall into the new ULU Travel\noffice and see how far\nyou can go this winter\nSpecial fares for students\nand academics.\nWorldwide scheduled\nflights on quality airlines.\n\u2022 Ski holidays.\n\u2022 Winter breaks around\nEurope.\n\u2022 ISIC cards, ISIS\ninsurance, Group rates.\nWinter Warmers include \u2014 daily\nflights to New York \u00a3 2 2 2 rt n.

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday November 7th198616 IC Rugby;Wednesday October 29th IC Fall to Sussex This was the third match in the\nU. A^U. competition for I.C., and\nSussex had the reputation of being\none of the better teams in the group.\nI.C. kicked off, and immediately\nstarted to take the game to the\nopposition, winning back\npossession in the first scrum and\nmaking good ground into Sussex's22 metre area. The first line out was\nwon and the ball whipped out to\nfly half Mike Anderson by the\nscrum-half, Andy Watson; the ball\nwas passed down the line, and a neck developed. Sussex won the\nball, and it reached their winger in a very slick fashion, and he ran half\nthe length of the pitch to score. I.C. retorted, with the forwards\ndominating and winning the lion's share of the set possession, and the\ngame was again played in Sussex's half. After about 20 minutes of play,\ntheir line again put in some good\nrunning, to score from a maul in the\nI.C.22 metre area. The referee\nordered a rather dubious penalty 5\nmetres from the I.C. line just before\nhalf-time, and the Sussex scrum half\ntook it quickly and flipped it out to\nthe winger, who went over in the\ncorner. After half time I.C. came\nback with a vengeance, with the\nforwards working hard and winning\nsome good balls. Steve Parker was\ncleaning everything up at the back\nof the line out, and Andy Martin was\nmaking life hell for the Sussex\nhooker in the scrum s. Josh Somhon\nand Jason Jenkins provided a solid\nsc rummaging base in the front row.\nUnfortunately for the I.C. pack,\nJason Jenkins was sent off with\nabout 20 minutes to go, and with\nonly seven men in the pack, I.C. could not carry on with the same\ndomination in the scrum. Mike\nAnderson pulled back 3 points with\na penalty kick, but full-time went\nwith I.C. the losers.\nFootball\nSeconds hold\nThirds\nOn a rain swept Harlington pitch\nlast Wednesday IC 3rds again\ngained an impressive draw against a lack lustre and somewhat\nde moral is ed IC 2nds. A fairly even\nfirst half saw chances at either end\nbut the 3rds gradually obtained\ncontrol. Heavy tackling and\ncommitment almost resulted in all\n22 players being sent off as tempers\nflared. Chris Budgen almost put the\n3rds ahead with an acrobatic header\njust wide.\nThe 3rds withstood early 2nd half\npressure and increased the tempo.\nAgainst the run of play Neil\nMacDonald thumped a superb\nheader against the 3rds crossbar.\nThe 2nds did take the lead with a clever chip by Phil Adams from the\nedge of the area. Not to be denied,\nthe 3rds piled on the pressure, Paul\nSavage and Paul Thompson both\ngoing close. The deserved equalise r arrived from Hideo Takan, a fine\nleft foot drive after a smart four man\nmove. Firing on all cylinders, the\n3rds laid siege to the 2nds goal only\nto be denied by excellent handling\nby 2nds keeper Dave Martin.\nThe final whistle came as a disappointment to the 3rds, but a relief to the 2nds, having clung on to\na valuable point.\nLadies Rugby\nSuccess\nContinues\nThis last week has seen the Ladies'\nRugby Team maintain their one\nhundred percent record with two\nfurther victories against Q.M. C. on\nthe Wednesday 24-4, and Reading\non Sunday 24-6.\nStrong forward play in both\ngames ensured good po session for\nthe backs. From this, quick passing\ndown the line meant the two wings\nVanessa Dodge and Sabrina\nDemello were often left with space\nand time to gain good ground and\noften score.\nTries in the two matches were\nscored by Vanessa Dodge (1),\nSabrina Demello (2), Judith Day\n(1), Judy Gardener (1), Blanca\nRoberts (2), Anne Parsons (4), Juliet\nFletcher (1). These victories provide\na base to build on for our\nforthcoming league games which\nbegin next Sunday against\nRichmond.\nThe UL U trials are this\nWednesday. Meet 1.30 outside\nUniversity of London Union, all\nplayers should attend.\nHockey\nOctober 26th; IC 1st XI\n8, Sussex 1\nSaturday; IC 1st XI 2,\nAshford 2\nIC Win At\nSussex\nI.C.l st XI continued their\nunbeaten run on Wednesday by\nscoring a resounding 8-1 victory in\nthe U AV competition over Sussex\nUniversity at Brighton. The game\nwas played on a very heavy, wet\npitch but even so, I.C. were able to\nuse their superior skill to control the\ngame and keep almost continual\npressure on the Sussex defence.\nGoals were scored by Paul\nHanrahan, Paul Skipworth,\nBrendan Farmer and Justin Smellie.\nSaturday's Middlesex League\ngame against Ashford ended in a22 draw. Harry opened the scoring for\nI.C. against a very strong\nopposition. Ashford eventually\nforced two goals despite Phil\nChoudry saving a penalty flick. A spirited effort by I.C. press uri sed the\ndefence and levelled the score.\nAnother successful week for the l st XI.\nHockey; Motspur Park Tournament\nLost on\nPenalties\nLast Sunday (26/10) marked the\nfirst outing this year for RSM's mixed team. The first stages of the\ncompetition consisted often minute\ngames within a league system. RSM\nwon three games against QEC, SOP\nand Chelsea and drew with K CH to\nput us top of our league despite\nhaving only 9 players. In the quarter\nfinals we drew 0-0 with QMCI after\nextra time, leading to a series of\npenalty flicks which sadly we lost on\nsudden death.\nIn general it was a great team\neffort although special mention\nmust go to Mark Rayfield, who\nscored three of our five goals, as well\nas the ladies, Kathryn, Barbara and\nSharon without whom our mixed\nteam would not have existed.\nAlastair Martin (Capt)\nHockey (again)\nIC Rock\nBrighton\nOn Wednesday IC Hockey 2nd's thrashed a brilliant Sussex side. The\nfirst outstanding achievement came\nwhen Josh scored with a well placed\npenalty flick. Following two\ndisallowed goals we pro ceded to\npress home our supremacy. The\numpire seemed a nice boy, in\nkeeping with most of Brighton's population. The second goal was\nrather fortunate, otherwise Gary\nKnaresborough would have been a eunuch by now.\nThe reorganised defence skillfully\nstifled their attack brilliantly\nwithout any difficulty. A clinical\nshort corner involving Eunuch,\nNanette and Travolta who scored,\nmade it 3-0. Josh then completed his\nhat-trick. The 5th was scored by NoName who dribbled it past the\ndefence and slotted it into the near\npost.\n\n"

I recently\nmanaged to get hold of a copy ofthe\nclub rules, which have quite an\ninteresting history. The first\nsecretary of the club had been left\nalone to write the rules and\nunfortunately, without the moral\nsupport of his fellow members and\nin a rare moment of weakness, he\nwent out and bought a bottle (or\ntwo) and proceeded to indulge in\nsome brain numbing. The upshot of\nall this was that a completely\nnonsensical set of rules was made\nup, as follows:\n1. All incorrect rules mean the\nopposite of what they say.\n2. There are an even number of\ncorrect rules.\n3. All self-referential rules are\ncorrect.\n4. Rule 6 is incorrect.\n5. There are two incorrect rules.\n6. In all other rules, the words\n\"incorrect\" and \"correct\" should be\ninterchanged.\nThere were seven rules altogether,\nbut my copy of them had been torn\nand all I could tell was that rule 7\nrefered to 'correct rules...'.\nNEWLY\nOPENED Brasserie\n134 CROMWELL ROAD( near to Sainsburys)\nKENSINGTON, SW7\nOpen122.30 pm;6.30 pm11.30 pm dally\nFriendly attentive ter vlc e In\nan atmosphere ot style and\ncontort\nFuUy licensed\nAir conditioned\nSeating tor 110\nPrivate parties ot up to 40\ncatered tor\n10% discount tor IC students\nand staff\nEarly reservations advisable\n01-370 7617\nA self referential rule is one that\nrefers to a set of rules including\nitself, for example rule 2 refers to\n'correct rules' and thus is self\nreferential if it is correct. The\namazing thing about these rules is\nthat, although some of them are\nincorrect, they are logically self-consistent.\nThis week's problem is to\ndetermine which rules are correct,\nand which are incorrect. Answers to\nthe FELIX office by 1.00pm Wednesday for the \u00a35 prize please.\nLast Week\nIt's rare that I am sup rise d by the\nanswer to one of my own puzzles,\nbut this week I was. The answer I had in mind, and the one that most\npeople had on their entries was the\nfollowing symmetrical path, with 14\nturns:\n/\nmY V/ A/m/ This is the minimum number of\nbends if the path is not to cross itself,\nbut this was not one of the\nconditions of the problem, and it\nturns out that it is possible in 13, as\nfollows:\n/\n/\n/\n/ /\n/\nV V//I have no idea if this is the unique\nsolution - it may be possible in even\nless!

Brilliant\nthough the cost-cutting idea was,\nthe unreliability of the public has\nalways been a problem with the\nshows. However this has now been\ncured with a totally computerised\nphone-in system. A minicomputer\nlinked to a speech synthesizer can\ngenerate up to6 million totally\ndifferent calls on any given subject\nsimply by linkin fc' sentences\ntogether. Radio Serpentine are so\npleased with their new unit that they\nare looking into an agony show\npackage. Another variant is the\nswearing generator with a built in\nfour second delay device, so that the\ncomputer can produce realistic bad\nlanguage and then edit it out of the\nprogram.\nThe Trellix Theatre in Covent\nGarden have hatched a new concept\nin Christmas entertainment. Bored\nwith the old pantomimes like\nCinderella and Mother Goose, they\nhave gone for adapting modern\nclassics. The first to receive this\ntreatment is George Orwell's1984 after the success of the film. Music\nand songs have been specially\nwritten for the cast of 20, which\ninclude new ones like: \"Ain't no fun\nin room 101\" and \"Newspeak\nmakes the world go round\".\nAngela Barrie of the theatre\ncompany thinks the story is perfect:\n\"When Smith takes Julia to his\nroom in the city, there's plenty of\nopportunity to say 'behind you,\nbehind you' as we li as booing the\nMinistry of Love.

At present there are people\nwandering around College with\nmaster keys that can open almost\nany door in College Halls. No one\nknows how many of these are\nmissing; only the people who have\nlost valuable items from their room\ncan estimate. At present it appears\nthat these keys are only being used\nto steal things; this is done in an\nordered way where the people know\nwhat to take. No one seems to have\nrealised that these keys could also be\nused for rape and that no one is safe\nin their own rooms at night. Last\nyear the College was warned (by an\narticle in FELIX), that security in\nhalls was appalling, in which it was\nstated \"will it take another rape or\nworse, before action is taken?\"\n(Thanks for that warning, B. Morrison and A. Barister). It would\nappear this was all but completely\nignored, and now the Rector has the\nnerve to say \"It is easy to be wise\nafter the event\".\nThe key system in Halls should\nhave been replaced years ago.\nCollege know that but have put no\nmoney aside to deal with it and have\nno plans to do so. At the last IC\ncouncil it was decided to force the\nStudent Residence Committee to do\nsomething about this fact.\nUnfortunately by the time this was\nraised at SRC the rape at Hamlet\nhad already occurred. SRC has\nagreed to set up a working party to\nlook into security (I am on it and\nany information is appreciated) but\nso far nearly two weeks have passed\nand I have not even had notification\nof a meeting.\nI completely agree with the fact\nthat nothing has been done, but the\nonly way we can force College to do\nsomething is to have hard facts. So\nplease send Christine or me any\nopinions you have or information\non break-ins etc. We need your help\nto help you.\nIan Howgate\n72, Beit Hall\nCivilisation\nExplained\nDear Dave,\nPerhaps you can help me as I am\nhaving trouble finding a satisfactory\nexplanation of \"civilisation\". Last\nWednesday I was honoured with an\ninvitation to the RCS Chemistry\ndepartment dinner. The following\nevening I drove a van for the\nICCA G Soup Run. I must say that,\nby all the definitions of the word\nthat I have found so far, the second\noccasion was more civilised. I am\npuzzled why some people attach so\nmuch formality to an excuse for\ngetting mindlessly ill and posing\naround in front of a few first years.\nIt puzzled me too why people should\npay so much for the privilege of\ndoing all this while consuming fairly\naverage college food which would\nbe better distributed to the, frankly\nmore civilised, down-and-out\npopulation of London.\nAm I just posing around and\ntrying to start an argument or what?\nMark Cottle\nLetters should arrive at the FELIX Office by 1.30pm on Tuesday prior to publication, and should be typed or\nhandwritten double-spaced on one side of A4 only.\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nTie Clubs Beat UGM\nBan by 23 Votes\nImperial College tie clubs, Chaps,\nLinks and 22, will be able to continue\nusing Union Rooms, after a motion to\nban them at Tuesday's Union General\nMeeting was narrowly defeated. On a paper ballot 128 students were in\nfavour of a ban on the three CCUbased clubs, and 151 were against.\nThe U GM was one of the best\nattended for several months, and\nearly speculation that quorum\nwould be challenged before two\nmajor motions were debated was\nnot realised. The \"motion on\nimproving the Image of Imperial\",\nwhich concerned the three tie clubs,\nhad been submitted as an emergency\nmotion late last week (See FELIX\n752). The chief objection to the\nclubs' use of ICU facilities was that\nno women had been admitted to any\nof them since they were founded\nover fifty years ago. The 22 club\nconstitution specifically denies\nwomen entry, though Chaps and\nLinks clubs do not have formalised\nentry requirements. Each of the\nclubs has an elected membership.\nProposing the motion, Jane\nSpiegel of Geology II argued that\nthe three clubs were detrimental to\nthe image of Imperial College, and\nthat they were a discouragement to\nprospective women students from\ncoming to Imperial. She said that\nshe did not consider elected\nmembership clubs to be\nunacceptable, but stressed that there\nwas no reason excluding women\nfrom such clubs.\nSpeaking against the motion,\nICU Hon Sec David Colley, a member of Chaps Club, said that\nthe clubs put a large amount of work\ninto the running of IC Union,\ndescribing the members as \"doing\nthe donkey work\". He added that\nthe members of the clubs were an\nimportant source of income for the\nUnion, and that \"money had to be\ntaken into consideration\". He said\nthat the clubs had been placed in an\nimpossible position, since it would\nappear to be a token gesture.\nICU President Christine Taig\nthen spoke seconding the motion.\nShe said that she had not intended to\nspeak, but wished to present the\nother point of view from within the\nICU Executive. Miss Taig described\nthe existence of the clubs as an\nanachronism and said that ICU\nought to come into the 80's. She\ntook particular exception to Mr.\nColley's remark that Links, Chaps\nand 22 \"ran the Union\", and cited\nseveral examples of women students\nwho also had contributed\nenormously to ICU.\nLinks Hon Sec Roger Wilson said\nthat it would do more harm than\ngood to ban the clubs from Union\nRooms, and that Links had done an\nimmense amount for Guilds Union\nand for ICU. He said that women\nhad been proposed recently for\nmembership of Links, adding that a ban of one of Union rooms was not\ngoing to promote the case of women\nwithin the clubs.\nDuring questions from the floor\nExternal Affairs Officer Mr. Mark\nCottle described much of Mr.\nColley's arguments as \"bollocks\",\nand thought that the recognised\n\"old boy\" institutions RCSA,\nRSMA and the Old Centralians\nprovided more support for ICU and\nthe constituent College Unions.\nPostgraduate Affairs Officer Gareth\nFish felt it was significant that the\nLSE, well' known as a college with\nmore left-wing students, supported\nboth all-male and all-female clubs.\nGrenville Manuel pointed out that\nthe clubs would be good targets for a national newspaper interested in\nwriting about \"institutional is ed sexism within British Universities.\"\nThe debate moved directly to a paper ballot after a procedural\nmotion to move straight to the vote.\nThe motion was defeated by 23\nvotes.\nFire Engine Runs\nOut Of Steam\nBoanerges, the mote rise d mascot of\nCity and Guilds College, succes fully made it to Brighton last Sunday in\nthe annual Brighton run. Jezebel,\nRCSU's veteran fire engine was less\nfortunate, however, and broke\ndown less than two hours after\nleaving South Kensington, when the\nmagneto developed a fault. Whilst\nJez was under repair in a car park in\nHooley, it was struck by a car\ntowing a caravan, and sustained\ndamage to the ladder supports,\nthough the ladder itself was\nundamaged. Remonstrations\nensued with the driver of the car,\nduring which some senior members\nof R CSU Motor Club are\nunderstood to have sworn\nvehemently. As this occurred in\nfront of his wife and children, the\ndriver reported the incident to the\npolice. Shortly afterwards the\nRCSU members were questioned\nbriefly by police, but later allowed to\nmove on, when the driver of the car\nwas persuaded that the perpetrate r of the foul language had already left\non the accompanying van.\nIn total the outward journey took\n7 and a half hours, due chiefly to\nsevere traffic jams. The return\njourney was a comparatively swift 4\nand a half hours.\n\n"

The Captain,\n'Dick' Ellis once -again drew the\nshort straw and attempted to guard\nthe goal. Andrew Winterton played\nmagnificently throughout the whole\ngame, showing his majestic skill,\n(guess who wrote this) and rounded\noff a brilliant first half by setting up\nOz, who walked the ball into the\nback of the goal.\nAfter finally deciding that the star\nof the 1st half, Nigel Brown, had to\numpire the 2nd half, IC set off to\nbuild up their lead. Craig Honeybun\nlived up to his name and stuck to the\nball. 'Leave' Roberts left the ball\nalone a lot. Harry lived up to his\nname by harrying the opposition\nand scoring the second goal\nbrilliantly. Ian Knox lived up to his\nname by knocking the ball around a lot. Dick lived up to his name\nAll in all it was a triumph of good\nover evil as the 3rds showed their\ntrue form which had been lacking\nduring October.\nMixed win\nIn the second of the two mixed\nmatches Imperial beat LSE in a close and enjoyable match played in\na friendly spirit.\nIC opened the scoring through\nAlan Cole, following a pinpoint 3\nyards pass from Brendan Farmer in\na well worked move. LSE equalized\nin the second half with a 'slightly'\nlifted shot which astounded\ngoalkeeper Richard Ellis, and the\nrest of the team.\nImperial clinched the match with\na goal from Jon Stonham, with an\nexcellent solid effort, after picking\nup a through ball from the left.\nThanks to Ann Jackson for\nplaying for the opposition (pity she\nhad such a good game), Sally\nMullen and Duncan Fitter for\nplaying at very short notice, and\nJustin Brooking for umpiring.\nYet more Hockey\nScratch Team\nDespite looking like a motorway\nmaintenance crew and playing\nhockey like one this scratch team of\ngeriatrics, cripples, and in com pet ants put up a creditable\nperformance against an obviously\nwell rehearsed team of Slavs.\nThe game got off to a slow start\nwith most people cursing the beer\nfrom Saturday night and learning\neach others' names. However Dave\n'Killer' Jennings soon found his old\ntouch and was again inciting the\nopposition into acts of violence. He,\nalong with the other inside forwards\nGary 'No name' Knaresborough\nand John '49 to go' Spencer made\nmany daring runs inyo the\nopposition's half but always seemed\nto run out of steam as soon as they\ngot into the D. Thanks to some\ngood backing up from the halves\nPippa Allen, Grunt 'no. 3' Wood\nand in particular Sarah Hodgson\nthe pressure was kept up and\nrewarded with many short corners\nwhich posed no threat whatsoever\nto the opposition. However at this\npoint the elder statesman of the\nteam Paul 'third time lucky'\nHenharen stepped in and showed us\nhow to score from a penalty corner\ni.e. with great perseverance.\nIn the second half the wingers\ntook up the running with Lisa\nFunney and Sarah Wood - Perry\nsupplying many excellent crosses.\nHowever SEES put on a late surge\nwhich was dealt with competently\nby backs Justin 'Bullet' Brooking\nand Lorna Stoodley and goalie\nJames T got ry th mn' Whitelaw,\nhowever, in the dying minutes they\nscored a fortunate goal from a short\ncorner, which caught all of I.C. on\nthe wrong foot.\n/ have been trying to present the sports reports in a more\ninteresting format than in recent years, in order to create the\nimpression of a proper sports page. This, I hoped, would make\nthe reports easier to read and encourage better writing. Most\nsubmissions are still of an appalling standard. Reports should\nalways be written in the third person, and should emphasise\nthe most important features of the game. References to \"what\nhappened in the bar\" should be kept to a minimum, and the\nforename-'nickname'-surname format avoided at all times. I do\nnot wish to discourage teams from writing reports, but I am\nnot going to print drivel; anything of the standard of the\nhockey article immediately above this will be discarded\nimmediately in future.

Unfortunately it rained\nnearly all day on Saturday\u2014\nspecially unfortunate for those of us\nwho were camping!-So flying was\nout of the question. Instead we had a days sightseeing and shopping in\nOxford. In a desperate effort to get\nout of the rain the Club Chairman\nand Pilot went to see \"Bambie\",\nthough we never found out if they\ncried in the sad bits!\nSunday was a lovely dry, clear day\nso after an early start we inflated the\nballoon and the Pilot Mike\nCarpenter set off with Richard\nWatkins and Andy Smith as\npassengers. They flew for about an\nhour and then accidentally landed in\na crop field. After placating a slightly angry farmer the balloon\ntook off again, this time with Jenny\nLewis and Andy Mears as\npassengers. They had a slightly\nmore s taigh t forward landing and\nthen we adjourned to the pub for\nlunch.\nIn the afternoon we fitted in one\nmore flight with Markus Mueller\ntraining to pilot and Phil Strong as a passenger. Unlike one of the other\nballoon teams they managed to\navoid landing in a field full of\ninquisitive cows. Finally, in the early\nevening we made our weary and\nmuddy way back to London after a weekend in the countryside which,\neven for the few of us who didn't fly,\nwas really good fun.\nRag\nGuilds Rag\nRag week approaches. The time of\nyear when pockets are emptied,\nstomachs filled, and problem sheets\nput aside.\nAs a special service to anyone\nwho enjoys a good giggle (or a good\ngig) here are details of the first two\nGuilds events of Rag Week\n1986\u2014Carnvial and the start of Hit\nSquadding.\nCarnival this year Features the\npowerful Drum Theatre, in what\nmay well be one of their last gigs\nplayed in this size of venue before\nthey move onto bigger things. Pink\nPeg Show are for those who fancy a bop, with their blasting renditions of\nrockabilly songs about getting\ndrunk and eating. Brother Brother\noffer a good mix of pop and funk,\nwith the mighty Swanjacks finishing\noff a \"something for everyone\" line\nup.\nThere will also be cabaret with\nKevin Day (fresh from The Comedy\nStore) and Belinda Blanchard,\ndescribed by TNT magazine as\n\"somewhere between an over-sexed\nPam Ayres and John Cooper\nClark\" so don't complain if it's a little naughty.\nThere'll also be a bar-bq, late\ndiscos, and the bar will be open until\n2.00 pm. If you don't have fun at\nCarnival you won't have fun\nanywhere.\nQT\nCustard\nIn Style... In Custard\nQT Society held their first annual\nCustard Tasting at lunchtime on\nThursday 30th. Over 50 members were served\npink, green, red and the more\nnormal yellow custard, all flavoured\nwith rum, brandy, or peppermint.\nAll the tickets to Wogan on 28th November were given out, but do\ncontact us if you wish to be put on\nthe waiting list.\nOur next meeting is on Thursday\n11th November at 1pm in Southside\nBar Upper Lounge where we will be\ndiscussing plans for the Annual\nBreakfast, the Smoking Concert,\nthe Wogan trip and, of course, the\ncoming revolution.\nAddress any mail to QT Soc,\nSCC, Union Office, Beit Quad.\n\n"

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday November 7th198620 No Progress Made The Managing Surveyor of\nResidences, Mr. Peter Hallworth,\nhas written to the Tizard Hall\nResidence Committee to explain\nwhy no progress has been made in\nthe proposed improvements to the\nTizard and Selkirk kitchens. In the\nletter, Mr. Hallworth said that his\nattempts to get things moving were\n\"constantly frustrated\" by the\nTizard and Selkirk Hall Warden,\nDr. Henry Hutchinson. The Tizard\nHall Committee has described the\nletter as \"childish and un profess ional\".\nMr. Hallworth explained that the\nWarden had not supplied him with\nthe final drafts of the Hall\nCommittee's suggested kitchen\nlayouts. When he did receive the\nlayouts in February he was unable\nto act because the plans contained\nno provision for the relocation of\nstair-case fridges, as required by fire\nregulations. A proposal from Mr.\nHutchinson to buy individual\nfridges at a cost of \u00a350 for each room\nwas rejected by Mr. Hallworth\nbecause of the high cost.\nSince then Mr. Hallworth has\nbeen waiting for Mr. Hutchinson to\nsubmit an alternative solution to the\nfridge problem.\nSouthside house-keeper, Kate\nMcPherson told FELIX that she\ndelivered a copy of Selkirk's kitchen\nlayouts, identical to those for\nTizard, to Mr. Hallworth in\nNovember, the previous year.\nMr. Hutchinson said that he was\nsurprised that the problem had not\nbeen referred back to the Students\nResidence Committee, when the\nindividual fridges were rejected.\n\"The Warden is responsible for\nthe social life and welfare of\nresidents. I would have expected the\ndecision over the fridges to be made\nby the SRC\", he said. The Tizard\nHall Committee will be holding\nfurther discussions with Mr.\nHallworth next week.\nEditors\nRatified Barclays Ban Beaten\nNext year's Handbook Editor\nand Alternative Prospectus (AP)\nEditor were ratified at Tuesday'sU GM. The Handbook Editor,\nPippa Salmon who was proposed\nfor the post by Jane Spiegel told\nFELIX that she was looking\nforward to starting work on the\npublication. Ms Sunny Bains, the\nAP Editor, proposed by Andy\nVickers was unavailable for\ncomment.\nSix months after first being tabled at\na Union General Meeting, Shaun\nDunlop's motion on Barclay's Bank\nfinally received a hearing on\nTuesday. The motion has appeared\non the agenda of a succession of\nUGMs since last Easter, but at each\none quorum was called before a vote\nwas taken. Quorum remained\nunchallenged throughout Tuesday's meeting because of widespread\ninterest in the \"tie club\" motion. On\na show of hands an amended\nversion of the motion, proposing\nthat ICU introduce publicity\nsanctions against Barclays, was\ndefeated by 121 votes to 108.\nThe original motion called for a ban on Barclays' adverts in all ICU\npublications, and requested that IC\nstudents do not open accounts with\nBarclays. Proposing this, Mr.\nDunlop quoted a series of examples\nof Barclays' involvement in South\nAfrican banking. He said that he did\nnot think it was possible for an\ninstitution to run a business in a country, and at the same time fight\nfor significant change in the\ngovernment of that country.\nSpeaking against the motion,\nJohn Martin vehemently refuted\nMr. Dunlop's arguments and said\nthat Barclays was working hard to\nreform South Africa. He said that\nBarclays provided financial support\nfor blacks, and stressed that there\nwas little connection between\nBarclays, as in Britain, and Barclays\nNational, as in South Africa.\nAfter the initial speeches, Sunny\nBains proposed an amendment to\nthe motion, altering \" ICU instructs\" to \"ICU requests\" editors\nof Union publications not to take\nBarclays advertising. This\namendment was upheld on a hand\nvote of 123 to 88, and Mr. Dunlop\nhanded the motion over to Miss\nBains. Following summing up\nspeeches, the motion was defeated\nby 13 votes.\nMost of the students present i eft the meeting after the vote and\nquorum was successfully\nchallenged. The meeting continued\nas an informal discussion group and\nprovisional ratification for the posts\nof Handbook Editor, Alternative\nProspectus Editor and Welfare\nOfficer took place, with Pippa\nSalmon, Sunny Bains and Tom\nMelliar-Smith being the only\ncandidates for each post. David\nLowrie, the only candidate for the\npost of Academic Affairs Officer\nwas provisionally ratified, pending\nconfirmation by the next meeting.\nLawson Cooks\nThe Chancellor, Nigel Lawson,\nannounced a \u00a310 billion spending\nincrease yesterday. Education will\nreceive an extra \u00a32.25 billion, which\nis nineteen percent more than was\noriginally planned. Mr Kenneth\nBaker, the Education Secretary,\nwelcomed this \"huge sum of extra\nmoney\" and described it as very\ngood news for universities,\npolytechnics and schools. However,\nthe Government admitted that the\nincrease would only be worth an\nextra one percent of this years\nexpenditure when last years\noverspending and teachers' pay rises\nare taken into consideration.\nMusical Chairs\nThe C.V.C. P.( Committee of Vice\nChancellors & Principals) will\nchange its Chairman in July. Mr.\nMaurice Shock the present\nChairman will pass the post to the\nVice Chancellor of Manchester\nUniversity, Professor Sir Mark\nRichmon FRS. Sir Mark has been\nan active member of the Committee\nsince becoming a Vice Chancellor\nfive years ago. He has chaired a number of C.V.C. P. committees\nand has also served on public bodies\nincluding the Government Genetic\nEngineering Advisory Group.\nGold Brick\nThe College House Committee is\nconsidering scrapping the 'Gold\nBrick' fund which is presently\navailable for the purchase of new\nstudent accommodation. If the\nmove goes ahead the College will be\nunable to raise deposits to secure\nbuildings suitable for new residences\nwhen they come on to the market.\nThe committee has calculated\nthat College could save up to\n\u00a340,000 a year if the \u00a3320,000 fund\nwere used to repay the loans taken\nout to buy Evelyn Gardens and\nMontpelier Hall.\nCollege Deputy Secretary, Mr\nBrian Lloyd-Davies, said that he\nwould not like to see the 'Gold\nBrick' go and pointed out that there\nwas already a shortage of\naccommodation at Imperial.\nSex Romp\nShock\nStudents at Balliol College Oxford,\nhave passed a motion banning\n\"frolicking and other forms of\npseudo affectionate activity from\nthe College precincts.\" The motion\nalso requests that anyone who\nwishes to indulge in \"public\naffection\" gives several days written\nnotice to the SCR committee.\nI.C.

Strange diseases might be\nsaid to be caught here, and the Exec\nlast year obviously fell foul to it so\nbadly that they banned the event \u2014\nbut why should the memorial to the\nMorphy in Morphy Richards cause\nsuch a rumpus? It's quite simple if\nyou think of it \u2014 residents of Putney\ndo too! The main event revolves\nround the inter CCU battle for the\nMorphy Oar \u2014 \"battle\" is not too\nstrong a word for what ensues for\nthis worthless piece of wood. After\nthe boat races on the Thames, the\nbattle starts on land, using weapons\nsuch as buckets of rotting fish, and\n'An opportunity to dress up\nin Mummy's clothes'\nrefuse which everyone has happened\nto have brought along for the day.\nThe winner is the C CU which\nmanages to drive off with the oar.\nPeople then adjourn, gracefully clad\nin their non-too-nice-smelling\nclothes, to Harrods for tea. After\nbeing thrown out of there, the\nremaining participants clean\nthemselves up, take a tetanus, and\nmeet in the Southside Bar ready to\ngo to a pub and attempt to drink it\ndry \u2014 or slightly damp anyway.\nLocations of the victimised pub are\nkept secret, not even I know where it\nis! Like good boys and girls,\neveryone attends lectures the next\nday on Thursday, and if you like\njumping up and taking your\ntrousers down at the mention of the\nwords \"gobbledygook\", then you're\nan obvious victim for Martin S. Taylor's hypnosis demonstration on\nThursday evening at 7.30 pm. Pink\nElephants and Marshmellow men\nappear before your very eyes \u2014\nthough not altogether Samantha\nFox or Edwina Curry, they prove to\nbe most amusing.\nFriday heralds a rather large\nparty in the Union Building. Based\non a similar format to Ents Carnival\ncomes Rag Guilds Carnival: bigger,\nbetter, busting with brilliant\nentertainment. Bands? We've got\nDrum Theatre, Pink Peg Slax,\nBrother Brother a.' support.\nComedians? No problem! Kevin\nDay, and Belinda Blanchard will\nmake you laugh yourself silly. A night to remember, but only those\nwho aren't completely plastered will\nremember. Who knows? You might\neven know someone there.\nLike good boys and girls you\ndon't go to lectures on Saturday.\nThe first weekend approaches, and\nRag Week takes a quiet breather.\nOn Saturday, we will be holding a Science Fiction video marathon for\nthose bod s with a fetish for Dr.\nWho, Jo-90, Space 1999, Men from\nUncle and more besides. People are\nquite welcome to watch, but some\npeople will be attempting to stay\nawake the full 48 hours. A quiet\nevening of cocktails in Southside\nBar rounds off a quiet Saturday with\na large range to tickle anyone's fancy.\nOn Sunday, you may have\nthought that you would be allowed\nto get some sleep for a change \u2014 but\nit is not to be. For at the very\nunsociable time of 10.00 am, the\nCCUs are holding a Tug 'o' War in\nPrinces Gardens \u2014 not content with\nthat, they suddenly rush off to the\nSerpentine to climb into strange\nartefacts constructed with lumps of\npolystyrene, bog rolls and sticky-back plastic (specified in the Blue\nPeter Manuals 703) and promptly\ntry to row across the stretch of\nwater, avoiding the ducks and\nfighting to stay afloat. Called the\nInter C CU Raft Race, the rafts make\namazing submarines after a while.\nIn the evening is Rag Barnite with\nChaps providing food in the form of\ntheir s uber b curries \u2014 the ones\nwhich are quite hard to get rid of \u2014\nat the Mines Ragarama. And so, the\nweekend finally ends, ready for Rag\nWeek Stage 2 and like good little\nboys and girls, we all attend lectures\nthe next day.\nAt lunchtime of the new week, the\nAerosoc Darts Tournament is held\n\u2014 taking place at the top of the\nUnion Building: you can fire your\nprototype origami warheads into\nBeit Quad. This is followed in the\nevening by the Mines Dirty Disco \u2014\nthree guesses what happens here.\nTime to dust off your dirty macs and\nsuspender belts and to meet the\nmature school girls.\nHow much for your wife? How\nmuch for the services of your body\nfor the day? Then come to the Slave\nAuction held on Tuesday\nlunchtime, when real flesh and bone\nWill be auctioned for the day for\nevery whim and fancy.\nGetting into full swing now, the\nRCS Beer Festival hits Rag Week on\nWednesday at 12.00pm where a selection of beers will be available\nthroughout the day (and night).\nAmazing things happen at Beer\nFestivals, and they often do!\nLike good boys and girls, we try\nto make the next day's lectures, and\nalthough unwelcome as it may seem,\nThursday arrives and queues for\ncoffee and as pr in s at Waitrose\nsuddenly form to stock up for Rag\nWeek Stage 3. The RCS Smoking\nConcert rears its head on Thursday\nevening, best described as a cross\nbetween the Wheeltappers' and\nShunters' Club and Live Aid. The\npatience and dedication of the\nperformance is nothing compared\nto that of the patience and\ndedication of the audience \u2014 places\nare amusing, places are awful and\nplaces just are. (Ear plugs not\nprovided).\nLike good boys and girls, you\nattempt for the last time to make the\nnext day's lecture. Into the final\nstretch now, and the Rag and Drag\nDisco appears on the scene on\nFriday night. No prizes for what\nyou're wearing. An event which\nmakes people realise their true inner\nfantasies and tendencies, it's a legitimate excuse for getting into\n\"mummy's\" clothes. On the same\nnight in Southside commences\n1000001 Darts, where people throw\ndarts at a board to get down to 0 in\nthe least throws before the end of\nSunday.\nRag Week 1986 now ends off on\nSaturday, with SCAB Nite. Not\nrelated to the Bubonic Plague,\nSCAB Nite is where various\nsocieties of the Social, Cultural and\nAmusements Board show off their\nwares. Although a little more\nadvanced in the professional ladder\nthan the Smoking Concert, the night\nwill prove to be just as entertaining.\nAnd thus ende th Rag Week 1986,\nbut not Rag 1986! More events will\nbe organised for next term. Till then\nRag will slowly gather its\nmomentum again, and the Rag\norganisers will try to catch up on\nlectures, sleep and food. I really\nhope you will enjoy Rag Week and\nthat the detailed descriptions have\nnot put you off. Spare a thought for\nthe cause and effect the means are\nirrelevant!\nMan Tai Tseung\nRag Chairman\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday November 7th19869 The most raucous twelve days of the\nCollege year. It's Rag\nWeek\nBut is booze, bopping and having\nfun the real excuse for Rag Week? In\nthe end, what have you as a supporter actually done? Was it just\nanother party? Questions like these\nattack the very fundamental reasons\nfor Rag Week; reasons which\nsometimes are taken for granted.\nThe charities benefit from our\nsupport which this year are:\u2022 The British Institute for Brain\nInjured Children\n\u2022 RADAR \u2022 Imperial Cancer Research Fund\n\u2022 The National Deaf Children's Society\n\u2022 The Rectory Paddock School\nfor the Mentally Handicapped\nEach charity has its merits, but\nthe main theme for this year is that\nwe are supporting the more\nhumanly related charities: charities\nwhich deal with people and\nchildren. Fundraising is difficult \u2014\nindeed fundraising organisers must\nhave the commit t ment and\nenthusiasm to face disappointments\nas they occur. So, enjoy Rag Week\n1986, and while you're out enjoying\nyourself, spare a thought to the real\nreason for Rag Week; the people\nyou're supporting and the good that\nwill come to them. The real credit\nultimately lies on people like you.\nWe cannot eradicate the nas ties of\nlife but at least we can try to alleviate\nthe problems of someone less\nfortunate than ourselves.\nHaving said that, now\nconcentrate on the way we intend to\nraise the money, and make you\nenjoy it too. It encompasses events\nas wide and varied as your own\nimagination: from parties to\ncomedy acts, boat races (both\nkinds), street-collecting and\nthrowing dustbin rubbish at each\nother. Some events involve money,\nsome involve just plain fun and a supply of as pr in s. Don't let me put\nyou off, but ssh! Rag Week 1986 is\ndefinitely here!\n\n"
