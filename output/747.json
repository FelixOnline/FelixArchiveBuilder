It's precursor 'Capital\nIdeas' managed to spot the likes\nof Half Man, Half Biscuit and\nZodiac Mindwarp before they\nwere even a glimmer in the Indie\ncharts, and celebrated Valentines\nday with an apocalyptic\nmassacre. Hopefully we can be as\nperceptive this year - although\nsome would say noticing Zodiac\nMindwarp scores very low on\nperception points. We also\npromise regular readers from last\nyear some changes for the better\nand especially that our itinerant\nAlbanian mountain cyclist is on\nHoliday on K2.\nIf you're new to London and\nhave an IQ of 25 or more you\nwill probably be struck by the\nplethora of just about everything\nin the indoor leisure field. If you\nhaven't, and you've just come out\nof hyperspace deep-sleep on the\nMl for the last million years,\nthen a look in one of the listings\nentertainment as a good reason\nfor doing so. There are probably\nstill a lot of you out there who\nhaven't yet lost your copy of the\nHandbook under a ton of\n'bump h', so I will try to avoid\nduplicating all the good advice in\nthat ubiquitous volume.\nEventually most of us will stray\naway from the fabulous delights\nof Imperial and some may even\nhelp to dispel the myth of\ntechnology students as insular\nPhilistines.\nMost people will see reviews of\nmainstream films and theatre\nelsewhere, added to which these\nthings are not exactly free. So\nDown and Out is being sent on a one year mission to seek out and\nexplore radical entertainment, to\nmeet cheap alternatives and to\nsink below standards of writing\nwhere not even SF Soc articles\nhave gone before. The cheapest\nentertainment is free, and yet cost\nis no measure of the quality of\nsome of the busking acts who\npopulate strategic nooks in the\nrealm of LRT a.k.a London\nTransport. Now, standing around\nmags is worthwhile. The free\nones such as LAM are good for\nfilms but Time Out and the more\nradical City Limits are more\ncomprehensive. After a short\nacc lim at is ation you will begin to\ns uss the economic facts of life\nfaster than any lecturer could\ndrum them home. You may well\nconclude that the government do\nnot actually intend you to enjoy\nyourself while you are here.\nUnless you're the sort of weirdo\nwhose daddy is a shipping\nmagnate then forever\nnightclubbing the hours of\ndarkness away is a big non-starter except for special\noccasions.\nNevertheless, most students who\ncome to London see\nin tunnels is not the best way to\nlisten to music although South\nKen subway does have great\nre verb. Venues such as the\nAlbert Hall and the omnipresent\nHammersmith Odeon are\nbeginning to get expensive, added\nto which the Odeon is completely\nlacking in atmosphere. Two\nrather better ven eus which attract\n'name' bands are the\nHammersmith Palais and the\nTown and Country Club in\nKentish Town. October 10 at the\nTown and Country, which has\nboth dance space and seating,\nsees Andy Kershaw favourite\nRobin Hitchcock with his band\nbe worth a look. There are\nconcessions between 6-8pm Monday to Wednesday.\nCloser to home the V&A have a photography exhibition showing\na general history of some of the\nbest work of the top names\nentitled Masterpieces of\nPhotography. Remember you\ndon't HAVE to pay to get in to\nthe V&A and just because it is an\nart museum its not only for\ntourists. The Boilerhouse section\nwhich specialises in design should\nbe of special interest to\ncommercially minded engineers.\nThe Egyptians.

It's difficult to write this without\nrepeating what I 've said before in\nthe Handbook or telling non-Freshers what they already know.\nHowever, bear with me and 1\n1\n1 do\nmy best.\nFirstly, hello to all new students\nand welcome back to all 2nd,3 rd,4 th,... nth years. If your summer\nwas half as good as mine you ll be\nfeeling tired, confused and totally\nunprepared for the year of hard\nwork ahead of you. Even if that's not\nthe case, there's the best Freshers'\nWeek ever to finish you off\ncompletely.\nGet down to the Union Building\ntonight for an evening of jive, skiffle\nand blues; allow your Constituent\nCollege Union to entertain you in\ninimitable style(?), Tuesday to\nThursday; laugh yourself silly at\nWednesday's comedy night; and\non Friday, back to the Union for the\namazing Freshers' Carnival; pop,\nreggae and rock bands (plus\nNorman and the Nutburgers, who\ndefy description!), films, discos, and\na late bar...see you there. As if all\nthat wasn't enough, there'll be\nevents in your Department and Hall\nof Residence...and the hyperactive\nmaniacs amongst you will be up at\nthe crack of dawn on Saturday to\ntid d ley wink down Oxford Street in\naid of rag charities\u2014one of Imperial\nCollege's more endearing\ntraditions.\nHave fun this week and whatever\nyou do don't miss the Freshers' Fair\ntomorrow afternoon. This is your\nchance to talk to the people\norganising various clubs and\n.activities and to decide which of\nthem appeal to you. It is\nin d is pensi ble if you intend to get\ninvolved in anything other than your\ndegree course.\nLectures? I believe they begin on\nWednesday.\nAnd now for the last bit of\npreaching...while you're in the\nUnion Building collecting your\nUnion Cards, have a look\naround\u2014especially at the new-look\nsnack bar on the ground floor. Oldtimers amongst you may notice a bit\nof a change...'Norman's( he of the\nNutburgers\u2014this is a man of many\ntalents) will now be open, with food\nand a bar, at lunchtimes and in the\nevenings. Don't forget that when\nyou eat and drink in the Union, not\nonly do you pay very low prices but\nalso any profits go back into the\nUnion to provide facilities for\nyou...OK end of sermon.\nThis summer has certainly been\neventful. It seems we're lucky to\nhave a full complement of sabbatical\nofficers\u2014What with Dave Colley\nnearly being lost at sea and Jackie\nPeirce nearly eloping\u2014which leads\nme to the fun bit. Congratulations\nto Jackie and Hugh (although I'm still stunned by your recklessness!)\nJust don't let it interfere with your\nu or k... and if anyone wants to bring\nme flowers and champagne (no\nstrings attached of course) you\nknow where the office is.\nChristine Taig\nToday is the first day of term (not\nnews!). Unfortunately at this late\nstage there are still many students\nwho have not managed to arrange\nany suitable accommodation (also\nnot news) but (good news) if that\nincludes you, there is no need to\ndespair. Crash Pad that all time\nfavourite is back for yet another\nlong run. Now playing in the Union\nUpper Lounge.\nCrash Pad is free, is open every\nnight from 9pm until 9.30am, and is\navailable to any homeless students\nwho book in for it, before 6pm, in\nthe Union Office. All you need is a sleeping bag, or e qui val ant, and a sense of humour. Crash Pad will\nremain in operation as long as is\nneeded.\nFor any women students who\nwon't be at the Freshers' Reception\ntoday, here's a reminder that I.C. Union has a policy to issue free, to\nany female student who wants one,\na personal rape alarm. These are\npocket-sized, high-pitched shrill\nalarms which can be collected from\nthe Deputy President, in the Union\nOffice, on production of a Union\nCard. Members of staff may\npurchase them at cost price (about\n\u00a31.50).\nAlso self-defence courses will be\nrun by the Police during the year,\nwith the first one hopefully running\nfor 4 weeks on Thursday evenings,\nfrom October 16th. Any women\nwishing to attend this type of course\nHello all you people.\nI have just arrived back from my\nholiday at sea in a36 foot yacht,\nmost of which was spent bouncing\nabout in a force 8 gale gusting 10.\nNow I am in the midst of organised\nchaos.

The people\nhave been saving up problems all\nover the summer and will with the\nplease sign up in the Union Office.\nThey are limited to 20 places but\nmore courses will be run according\nto demand.\nThis isn't meant to sound like\nscare-mongering, but there is a need for women to be prepared\nagainst assault.\nJackie Peirce\nImperial College Charity Rag will be\nstaging the very popular annual\nevent of Tiddleywinks down Oxford\nStreet on Saturday October 4. It's an event not to be missed and there\nare major prizes for the 3 top\ncollectors. Meet at your CCU office\nat 9.00am to collect your badges\nand cans, and look out for posters\nthroughout the week.\nOur second major collection will\nbe happening on Saturday October\n18th, when we will be playing human\nmonopoly. This is basically a treasure hunt though out London\nwith your travelcard paid for by us.\nClues! will need to be solved, and a prize of an Olympus camera will be\npresented to whoever wins. In the\nevening of Monopoly, there is also a best timing possible choose now to\nsmack us with them.\nStill I am the optimist, relishing\nthe prospect of the new term after\nthe lee of the summer and looking\nforward to meeting most if not all of\nmy old friends and the first years. The first Question to answer will\nbe about Parking Permits.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 2\nConcerned\nDear Dave,\nAs one of the people who signed\nthe Barclays Bank Anti-Apartheid\nleaflet in this year's handbook I am\nslightly concerned about a couple\nof issues it has raised. Several\npeople have suggested to me that\nofficers of the union have abused\ntheir positions of responsibility by\ndistributing their own propaganda\nthrough union resources.I wonder\nwhether this insert would have\nbeen allowed if it had not been\nespousing a political cause\nsupported by the President.\nI have happily associated my\nname with the Anti-Apartheid\ncampaign as I believe that the time\nwhen our elected representatives\nshould have unequivocally done\nthe same is long past. To those who\nsay that Barclays are an innocent\nbystander in the Apartheid regime\nI would reply that even if there were\nsome truth in this it is far less\nunfortunate than the mounting\ndeath toll in the black townships.\nAs the British government has\nresolutely resisted proper sanctions\nin its attempts to protect\ninvestments in South Africa it is\nbecoming more and more\nnecessary for independent groups\nto make whatever gestures they can\nto protect our long term standing\nwith the Southern African nations.\nUnfortunately IC Union has no\nclear policy on the South African\nissue. In this case it is inevitable\nthat commercial pressures on such\nenterprises as the handbook will\ntake priority in deciding what\nadvertising to carry. However\npurely commercial criteria would\nhave suggested that the drought\nvictims in northern Africa should\nhave been left to die - to their credit\nmillions of people decided these\nwere not the only criteria and\nflocked to support the 'Band Aid'\nappeals. It is time Imperial students\ndecided where they stand one way\nor another on this issue at a Union\nmeeting so that the decisions are\nnot delegated to individuals by\ndefault. Similarly, maybe there\nshould be a clear policy on who is\nallowed to send out material via the\nfresher s mailing.\nI do not really believe there\nshould be any conflict over this\nissue but perhaps matters should be\nclarified. I wonder what sort of fuss might have arisen had the\nConservative Society asked to be\nable to distribute counter-propaganda in reply to the\nBarclay's leaflet. I hope they would\nhave got a fair hearing. I hope\nExecutives will avoid getting\nconfused between their rights as\nmembers of IC Union and their\nobligation to impartiality as paid\nstaff, I belive they have just about\nmanaged so far.\nYours looking concerned as ever\nMark Cottle\nBigoted\nRe-Apps\nDear Dave,\nAs a resident of Beit Hall I have\njust received a copy of \"Otto\", the\nBeit Hall newsletter. I am\ndisappointed to see the sort of\nimpression it gives to Freshers. It\ncontains what purports to be a timetable of Freshers' Week. If\nFreshers take any notice of this at\nall they will be stupid if they attend\nany of the Freshers' events. I was\nalso saddened to read a revue of the\nUnion Bar that was full of dated\nclich es. Imperial College Union has\ninvested, on behalf of its members,\na significant amount of money in\ndeveloping the bar, as part of an\neffort to make the Union Building\nthe centre of social life at College.\nEveryone involved in this\nprocess expects to meet with a great\ndeal of difficulty in removing the\nstigma attached to \"The Union\"\namongst returning students.\nHowever the job will be impossible\nif their bigoted views are imposed\non Freshers, especially in such a forceful way by re-apps in an\nofficial newsletter.\nIf it is not sufficient reason that\nthe profits of the bar belong to the\nStudents' Union, then the editors,\nfrom a point of view of accuracy,\nshould have taken time to walk 50\nyards across Beit Quad to find if\nthere was anything better they\ncould tell the new residents of Beit\nHall about the Union. May I make\na plea to all Freshers; there are\nmore than enough people willing to\ngive you their opinion, but please\nreserve judgement until you have\nseen for yourself.\nYours sincerely,\nJackie Pierce,\nIC Union Deputy President.\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI am writing to you as I believe\nthat in your capacity as President\nof the Students' Union you may\nwell be able to be of assistance to\nme and my family.\nTo put you in the picture, my\ndaughter has been in hospital for\nseveral months and is to return\nhome shortly to recoup e rate. Her\nillness is in no way infectious but\nthe doctors believe that she will\nneed about a year to recover,\nbefore she can return to work.\nInitially, I shall be able to stay with\nher but after that I wish to make\narrangements for someone to come\nto our home every day so that she is\nnot left entirely alone every day. I therefore thought it might be\npossible that a student would be\nwilling to come in for a few hours\nonce or twice a week during the\nafternoon. I would point out that\nmy daughter does not need a nurse\nbut merely wishes to have\nDep Reps\nDefended\nDear Dave,\nI feel I must reply to a point\nraised by Hugh Stiles in his recent\nopinion article (FELIX, Sept 7).\nHe suggested that CCUs\nmanipulate the Dep Rep vote on\nCouncil by threatening to cut\ndepartmental society funds, hence\nsecuring a CCU majority on\nCouncil. The idea is totally\nunrealistic and slanderous. Dep\nReps are intelligent people with\nminds of their own and may vote as\nthey see fit. Furthermore, if a CCU\ndid threaten Departmental society\nfunds, the Dep Rep concerned need\nonly publicise the fact and untold\nunpopularity and damage would\nresult for the CCU concerned\n(especially if ICU were to find out). This, coupled with the fact that\nmost Dep Reps, unfortunately,\ndon't attend Council, makes\nHugh's idea of a CCU conspiracy\nto take over ICU seem laughable.\nA chairman of Council must be\nimpartial. I wouldn't like to think\nthat there is any bias which will\nshow through in the coming year.\nFinally, I would like to say I appreciate the work of the Major\nSub Committees (MSCs) and feel\nwe mustn't always think in terms of\nMSC/CCU conflict. I bare Hugh\nno malice, I merely wish to clear up\na piece of Anti-CCU story telling.\nYours Sincerely\nDuncan Royle\nPresident City and Guilds Union\nsomebody else present in the flat.\nThe student would not be expected\nto keep her company and would be\nfree to read or pursue their studies\nas they wish.\nIf you think it would be at all\npossible that you could put us in\ntouch with a student who could\nhelp us out in the way described\nabove I should be most grateful. I should add that we live in South\nKensington, near the Gloucester\nRoad tube and that, if required, we\nwould be happy to provide you\nwith references. I can be reached\nduring the day at the address and\ntelephone number given above.\nWith kind regards,\nYours faithfully,\nMaria Gani-Senger.\n(Editor's note: Anyone interested\nshould contact Christine Taig in the\nUnion Office).\nSexist?\nDear Dave,\nAgain and again I am appalled\nby the attitudes of some of the\npeople I meet, and nothing disturbs\nme more than some of the sexist\nand racist views I hear from people\nwho should know better.\nIf you ask one of these people if\nthey are racist/sexist their reply is\nan alarmed \"Of course not\". What\nthey mean is that they are not\nconsciously discriminatory.\nAnybody who has been brought up\nwith the attitudes around today, I contend, cannot help but\ndiscriminate against certain\ngroups. It is this unconscious\ndiscrimination that is the greatest\ndanger to the multicultural society\nthat exists in Britain today, not the\nravings of the National Front and\nthe occasional Tory MP.\nWhat do I mean by unconscious\ndiscrimination? I mean the\nassumption that certain jobs are\ncarried out by a certain sex, that\ncertain races have certain\ncharacteristics and so on, that we\ndo without thinking. The exact\nnature of these opinions is\nunimportant; what is important is\nthat they exist but we are extremely\nreluctant to admit that they do.\nWhat is a society so ridden with\ndiscrimination doing to improve\nthe situation? Unfortunatly, by its\nvery nature, it is the minorities that\nare discriminated against, and\nunless the ruling majority decide to\ndo something about it, it is the\nnature of our society that nothing\ndoes happen. All the media are in\nthe control of the majority; they are\nvery slow to change, and, without\nany pressure, why should they?\nOnly the ordinary person can do\nanything about it. I support any\nidea that makes you think about\ndiscrimination, instead of\nreinforcing it. One minor point is\nthe use of the word 'Chairman'. It,\nhowever slightly, reinforces the\nsexual stereotype. 'Chairperson' or\njust 'Chair' is better, if only because\nit makes you stop and think that\nthe majority of 'Chairmen' ARE\nmen. I am concerned about the\nnumber of people who think that\nthis whole thing is a 'lefty' idea and\nrubbish the whole thing. If being\nagainst discrimination is a 'lefty'\nidea, then I hope that you are all\n'lefty s'. Bringing the issue closer to\nhome, just because there has never\nbeen a woman in charge of a Major\nSubcommittee of IC Union does\nnot mean there never will, and to\ndeal tiny blow against discrimination n myself, I am announcing that\nI prefer to be called the 'Chair' of\nPublications Board. You can call\nme whatever you like; I 'll be happy\nif you just think about what you are\nsaying when you say it.\nYours,\nChris Martin,\nChair, Publications Board.\nAn Appeal Reprinted from FELIX 745\n\n"

The handout for this new\nBerkoff play, which examines the\nevents surrounding the fateful\nsinking of the Argentine cruiser\nGeneral Belgrano, asks what is\nfunny about the death of 368 young\nmen and replies: 'Steven Berkoffs\nSINK THE BELGRANO, that's what...' Unfortunatly, despite\nsome clever lyrical words and\ngenerally good acting, Sink the\nBelgrano! is neither funny nor\nparticularly moving.\nSet in April and May 1982 the\naction revolves around: The Prime\nMinister (Maggot); The Secretary\nof State for Defence (Nit); and\nForeign Secretary (Pimp). Their\nstupidity and one-sided\npresentation attempts to provoke\nlaughter; but, despite a strong\nperformance from Maggie Steed as\nMaggot, the feeling is that Berkoffs\ncombination of verse, horror at the\nevents that occured, and\nhumorous disbelief of political\nmachinery lacks direction. Rather\nthan being dragged from one\nemotional extreme to the other the\naudience are left unaffected.\nMore effective are the rhythmic\nchorus. Six-Bash the Argies, 'Tits\nlike Melons'-working men who\ndouble up as Soldiers, Sailors\nwriting to their loved ones, Harrier\njets and finally the dead.\nMaggot's ratings at the polls,\n(27% before the Malvinas\n/Falklands conflict, 45% after)\nconclude a play that seems self-defeating and confused in terms of\nwhat it desires to achieve.\nHowever, the closing line leaves\nlittle doubt as to the Governments'\nwish: 'I would do it again'\nMaggot/Margaret Thatcher.\nSimon Lewis SINK THE BELGRANO!\nLITERATURE When you were young and\ninnocent and choosing a university, the Imperial College\nProspectus 86/87 promised you\nthat the Haldane Library\n'contains in pleasantly informal\nsurroundings some 34,000\nbooks on a very wide range of\nsubjects including a collection\nof fiction'\nThe Haldane Library does, to its\ncredit have pleasantly informal\nsurroundings with comfy seats and\na fine selection of the newspapers\nand periodicals that you live to\nread, but cannot afford to buy\n(Punch, Private Eye, The Financial\nTimes etc.) It also has a good\nrecord and tape library, with\nsomething for all tastes, and a friendly and helpful staff.\n...Books....Who said books\n....What Books?\nThe selection of fiction in the\nHaldane is the worst I have ever\nseen even in a small branch library.\nImperial College's well deserved\nreputation for illiteracy does not\nexcuse a collection of books which\nappear to be derived from the\nrejects of Edwardian Boarding\nSchool libraries. There are some\nexceptions, like the Emma Lathen\nbooks, American detective writing\nat its best; also Sartre and Isaac\nBashevis Singer. In an effort to do\njustice to the Haldane I have\npicked out a few books in fairly new\ndust jackets:\nHow Green Was My Valley by\nRichard Llewellyn is the best book I found, and probably the best book\nin the library. It is the story of a Welsh mining family and their\nvalley seen through the eyes of\nHuw Morgan, who grows up there\naround the turn of the century. It\ncomes as a shock to find that\n1\nstrikers' children starved to death\nin our grandparents time. The tale\nj of the life and loves of Huw Morgan\ni may help us English to discover\n| why the Welsh hate us so much;\nafter all, we were not beaten for\nspeaking our native language at\nschool.\nFire from Heaven by Mary\nRenault is also set in a foreign\ncountry only this tame it is Greece\naround 330 years BC This work is\npart of a series on Alexander the\nGreat. Here his childhood and\nyouth are displayed, making a very\nreadable tale that also has great\n(historical accuracy. The farming\nmethods, eating habits, warfare,\nand culture are all dealt with.\nAlexander is found in the middle\nof an ancient 'Kramer vs Kramer'\n\u2014 his parents, King Philip the\nGreat and Queen Olympas witch\nand priestess of Bacchus, fight\nover him and ultimately over the\nKingdom; the story ends with King\nPhilip's murder. Alexander is\nportrayed as perfect which cannot\nbe true, but the richness of detail\ncontained within Fire from Heaven\nleft me with a yen to read the other\nbooks of Ms. Renault; Funeral\nGames, The Last of the Wine, and\nThe Mask of Apollo.\nThe last book, The Crucified\nCity by Peter Van Greenaway\ndoes not measure up to the others.\nThe 'Bomb' drops on London one\nMaundy Thursday, and a bunch of\nsurvivors walk to Aldermaston\nbefore they die. Badly over-written\nand full of st ero types I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.\nSarah Kirk\n\n"

At the under-23 World\nChampionships in Hamburg, the\nGB quadruple scull, including IC\nmen Nicholas Burfitt and Leon\nFletcher, crossed the line level with'\nthe French quad in the final, and\nwere awarded joint gold medals. A third IC Oarsman, Guy Pooley, was\nalso in the GB U23 Team.\nAt the Senior World Championships in Nottingham the U23 quad\nalso competed but were outclassed\nby much old ler and more\nexperienced opposition. A further\nthree IC oarsmen, John Griffiths,\nBill Downing and Chas Nelson,\nwere selected in the GB lightweight\neight which came eighth.\nEarlier in the Summer, at Henley\nRoyal Regatta, the club's VIII\nmissed winning the Thames Cup by\na whisker. Having had the harder of\nthe two semi-finals on the Sunday\nmorning of the 5-day Regatta, they\nmet Canada's Ridley College, the\nprevious years' winner, in the final.\nUnrecovered from the morning's exertion IC lost by one and half\nlengths. In the Visitors' Cup, which\nIC won in 1985, both the club's VIIIs\ngot through to the semi-finals on\nSaturday but progressed no\nfurther.\nThe club had a total of sixty-four\nwins last year, beating the record\nset the previous year and making a total of more than two hundred wins\nover the last four years. This year\nseveral members of the club are\nlikely to be called up to the national\nsquad.\nIC CHOIR - Long WeekendsSince its formation Imperial College\nChoir has flourished under the\nexpert and indefatigable guidance\nof Professor Eric Brown. It now\nenjoys a reputation for\nperformances of a consistently high\nstandard. To maintain this\nreputation the Choir needs new\nmembers, and encourages them to\njoin as soon as possible. No\nauditions are held, although each\nindividual should be able to keep in\ntune with the rest of the Choir! Girls\nare particularly welcomed to bolster\nthe ranks of the Sopranos and\nAltos.\nRehearsals are held every\nThursday at 5.45pm in Mech Eng\nroom 342. Care is taken to ensure a varied selection of music to suit all\ntastes; last year composers varied\nfrom Bach to Bernstein. Afterwards\ncoffee is served and new members\nhave the opportunity to social is e and get to know everyone. For\nthose who are particularly keen\nthere is a Chamber Choir which\nrehearses additional works later on\nin the evening. Performances are\ngiven once a term.\nLong weekends are arranged in\nthe Christmas and Easter vacations\nduring which the Choir travels\noutside London for rehearsals in a different atmosphere.\nFurther details are available at\nFreshers' Fair, or come to the first\nrehearsal on Thursday October 2 at\n5.45pm in Mech Eng 342.\nSCOUT & GUIDE - ButtiesLunchtime Butties is held every day\nat 12.30 above Southside bar by IC\nScout and Guides. The club's main\nactivities are mountaineering, rock\nclimbing and caving.

This year\nwe plan to visit Fort William and the\nGlencoe region at Christmas, and\nTorridon at Easter. During the\nsummer there is a three week tour\nabroad. The venue last year was the\nPyrenees.\nS&G Club welcomes new\nmembers of any year especially\nFreshers. The club is an ideal\nintroduction to the activities\nmentioned above, but if you are\nalready an experienced climber, so\nmuch the better.

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 24\nLoans On The Way\nEducation Secretary Kenneth Baker\nhinted in his speech to the\nCommittee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals in Edinburgh last week\nthat he was still considering the\nintroduction of student loans. His\npredecessor, Sir Keith Joseph,\nstrongly advocated that students\nshould make a contribution to their\nsupport by repaying some of the\ncost after leaving higher education,\nand Mr Baker reiterated this by\ntelling the Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals that\nstudents \"will benefit materially as\nwell as intellectually from their\nstudies, and it seems paradoxical\nthat they should be so highly\nsub sidi sed by the average taxpayer,\nwhose earnings they will soon\novertake and leave behind\".\nHowever he was quick to stress that\nany Government seeking to\nintroduce loans would have to be\nconvinced that it would not have\nany disincentive effect on entry into\nhigher education. He also suggested\nthat employers should enter into a combined grant/loan scheme of\nstudent support by paying off loans\nthat students took out to finance\ntheir education.\nAs well as discussing loans, he\nalso stressed that the present\nConservative Government will\nallow no university to close under its\nadministration, instead he wanted\n\"to see a higher proportion of our\nyoung people and more older\nstudents going into higher\neducation of all kinds\". Mr Baker\nalso wants to see greater selectivity\nin research funding and the\nrational is ation of some depart-ment s. continued from page 1\nLtd., who had been working\nexceptionally hard to get the Houses\nready for the arrival ofthe students.\nDuring the Summer, the site\nforeman had left Solebrooks and\nthis had delayed the work\nsignificantly; it had been necessary\nto restrict the improvements to\nSouthwell House.\nUnion President Christine Taig\ncommented that the delay was\nabout 'par for the course' and that\nmore forward planning would have\nalleviated the problem.\nThe parents of an incoming first\nyear student made a direct\ncomplaint to College Secretary\nJohn Smith about the condition of\nthe Evelyn Gardens accommodation. Mr Smith gave his\nassurance that the situation would\nbe remedied at once.\nMr Hallworth has written a letter\nto all residents of Holbein and\nSouthwell Houses a polo gi sing for\nthe non-completion of the\nimprovement works.\nUniversity leaders have reluctantly\ndecided to support the principle of\nintroducing a mixed system of\nstudent grants and loans. The\nCommittee of Vice-Chancellors and\nPrincipals (CVCP) felt that such a scheme was unavoidable if the\nnumber of students in higher\neducation is to be substantially\nincreased. The committee feared\nthat, if grants were to be restored to\na reasonable level, this would be so\nexpensive that it would result in cuts\nin student numbers.\nProfessor Fred Holliday, ViceChancellor of Durham University\nand chairman of the CVCP's awards\nsub-committee, said of the meeting\nlast Wednesday: \"Our top priority is\nto get more students into higher\neducation. In our judgement\ninadequate grants are blocking that.\nWe do not think that grants will be\nrestored to a proper level. Since\nstudents can't study if they haven't enough to live on, we are looking for\nthe most certain way of getting that\nmoney for them.\"\nEarlier this month, an education\nminister claimed that a plan to look\nat the viability of student loans will\nnot reduce the opportunities for\nstudents from poorer backgrounds to\nenter higher education. Mr George\nWalden, Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State for Education,\nspeaking at a Federation of\nConservative Students conference\nsaid: \"There is almost a conspiracy\nof misinformation about the\nGovernment's achievements in\nhigher education. We are educating\n80,000 more students than in 1979 to\nthe same or better standards and the\nsame costs as before.\n\"Inevitably there is a point where\nexpansion costs money. That is one\nreason we are taking a new look at\nstudents' support, including the\npossibility of loans.\"\nUnion number two Jackie Peirce and UGM Chairman Hugh Southey have\nannounced their engagement. The couple made their decision after a holiday\nin Paris which former FELIX editor Hugh won in the raffle at last summers'\nRag Fete. FELIX can confirm that the proposal o cur red at lam on Tuesday\nmorning whilst Miss Peirce was recovering from a back injury.\nHugh looks set to make a FELIXfirst; no editor since 1974, when the post first became a sabbatical, has ever got married.\nBoth Mr Southey and Miss Peirce denied ever having appeared on\n'Eastenders'.\nPool Award Tower Open\nThe swimming pool in the IC\nSports Centre is the first to receive\na prestigious award for energy\nefficiency from the London\nElectricity Board. The 'Beta' award\nis given for major energy savings in\nbuildings measuring up to 1,000\nsquare metres. The designer of the\npool's ventilation scheme, Graham\nManning, accepted the award\nduring a celebratory lunch at the\nSavoy Hotel on September 9th. The Queens Tower will be open to\nvisitors on Tuesday September 30,\nthe price of admission will be 60\npence. There is an excellent view of\nLondon from the top of the Tower,\nwhich is normally open to students\nand the public on the day of Rag\nFete, but has been launched as a tourist attraction over the summer.\nThe Tower is one of the tallest\nbuildings in London without a lift.\nVehicle\nFlattened\nA students' motor car was destroyed\nlast week when a large quantity of\nwood was dumped on top of it. The\ncar, an R registered mini belonging\nto Mech. Eng. postgraduate David\nNicholson, had been parked at the\nback of the chemistry building. A firm of contact or s,R. Bennet and\nSons, who were clearing out a storeroom in Chemistry, threw out\nthe wood from a first floor balcony\nwhich was directly above the car.\nThe front section of the roof of the\ncar was flattened to the level of the\nseats.\nMr Nicholson said that the value\nof the car was approximately \u00a3350.\nThough not in a running condition,\nthere was a note in the car\nexplaining that it was under repair.\nR. Bennet and Sons were hired by\nMr Peter Hallworth, managing\nsurveyor of Residences. Mr\nHallworth said that the contact or s must have thought that the car was\nof no value since it was parked in the\nvicinity of the RCS motor club,\nwhere there is a selection of defunct\nvehicles. He has advised Mr\nNicholson to contact his insurers, as\nit is a matter between them and the\ninsurers for R. Bennet and Sons.\nTranscendental\nSociety\nA Transcendental Meditation\nSociety is being re-formed at IC this\nterm by members of RCS. Any\nstudent who is interested in joining\nshould contact Paul Newman, an\nastrophysics postgraduate, on\ninternal 6659. Mr Newman\ndescribed Transcendental\nMeditation as a \"simple, natural\nmeans of allowing body and mind\ndeep rest and relaxation\".\nBar Manager\nKevin Buckely has been appointed\nas Union Bar Manager. Mr Buckley,\na former IC student, had been\nemployed as a manager in a temporary capacity since the start of\nJuly. Former ICU Hon Sec, Sean\nDavis, has been appointed as\nBarman.\nWomen's Tutor\nMrs Sandra Dawson, of the\nDepartment of Social and\nEconomic Studies, has been\nappointed as the new Senior Tutor\nfor Women Students. She replaces\nMrs Margaret Cunningham of the\nDepartment of Computing.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 9\nI Corno tIC Chris Hall on Imperial's neighbour and namesake-Ithaca College\nIt wouldn't be unreasonable to\nassume that most students at\nImperial could readily identify that\ncentre of education known\ninformally as IC. But then why not,\nfor that has been the nickname for\nImperial for years, but then how\nmany people know of the IC in\nupstate New York? Further more,\nwhy should it concern them?\nFor a group of 140 students\nresiding in the around the\nGloucester Road area, IC means\nITHACA College, again the name\nthe College has been known by for\nyears. Ithaca College is a private\ncollege of 5000 students in upstate\nNew York. In many ways very\nsimilar to Imperial, it has a strong\nScience and Technology program,\npublishes its own newspaper, and\nruns a television studio and a radio\nstation. Unlike Imperial it lies in the\nsmall college town of Ithaca NY,\noverlooking the finger lakes and\nacross the hill from Cornell\nUniversity. Originally a music\nconservatory, today Ithaca has an\nexcellent communications program\nand a branch in London. This is\nwhere IC and IC come together.\nIthaca London Centre, one of the\nfive American Universities to be a part of Imperial, is situated in\nHarrington Gardens, about a mile\nfrom Imperial. While many of the\nstudents who attend the London\nCentre come from Ithaca (NY),\nsome come from other institutions\nacross the country. The London\nCentre is one of the only American\nUniversities to teach in the 'English'\nsystem, thought by many to be\nstronger and more concise than the\n'American' system.\nThe Freshman programme at\nIthaca London is almost unique. It\nis unusual for most college students\nto take a semester or a year abroad\nuntil at earliest the sophomore (2nd) year. The Freshman programme\nserves a double purpose, a unique\nprogram for American freshmen\nand a preparation ground for those\nforeign students who might wish to\nmake the adjustment to an\nAmerican University. For while\nalmost all of the teachers at the\nCentre are English, the courses are\nsimilar to those that might be taken\nback on the home campus in New\nYork, only here they are taught in\nthe English method.\nFrom the exposure to Imperial,\nstudents can still see the many\ndifferences between the American\nand English Universities and\ncolleges. Sports are far more\nimportant to American Colleges,\nand weekends are reserved for\nathletic competition which many in\nthe colleges will turn out to watch.\nFootball (American), Soccer\n(English football), hockey (ice, not\nusually field), basket ball, and\nlacrosse are just some examples of\npopular american sports. The\ndebate still rages between\nAmericans and English; 'is rugby\ntougher than football?' Even most\nAmericans will c once ed this, for it is\nprobably the largest sport the two\ndifferent systems have in common.\nIt is interesting to note that the\ndrink ng age in England is only 18,\nwhereas in most States in the\ncountry it is 21 and strictly enforced.\nProbably it is why alcohol is not\nlooked at in this country as it is in\nthe States, for now many college\nbars are being forced to close down\nbecause of the business that is lost\ndue to the drinking age.\nIf there is truly anything that all\nstudents love it is the pub, which is\nreally non-existent in the United\nStates. A pub is a place for\nsocializing as well as for drink ng,a Adjusting to the\ngreat British sense\nof humour is a challenge. While\nmost colleges have\na prank squad, it\nseems that the Rag\nFete, and the Rag\nMag are unrivalled\nplace to strike up conversations with\nthe person sitting next to you. It has\nthe social aura to it that makes a bar\n(in the States) seem impersonal and\ncold. It always seems that everybody\nknows everyone, in whatever pub\nyou go to. Bars are usually quieter\n(unless it is a college bar) for people\ntend to stick to themselves.\nAdjusting to the great British\nsense of humour is also a challenge.\nWhile most colleges have a prank\nsquad, it seems the Rag Fete, and\nthe Rag Mag are unrivalled, (except\nat MIT where they put cars on top of\nbuildings.)\nWith the help of Dave Colley ICU\nHon Sec it seems that the overseas\nstudents are finally getting the hang\nof things at Imperial. The different\nclubs, activities and sports (not to\nmention the Union Bar are\npresenting challenges. For Ithaca\nstudents, IC is no further away than\na mile!\nTuesday September 23 saw IC's five American Associate Colleges\ncome together for an Americanfest in\nthe Union Bar. About 100 students\nfrom Florida State, Michigan, Texas,\nMissouri and Ithaca gathered to\ndrink Budweiser and attempt to play\ndarts while get ing to know some IC\nstudents. The fest, organised by ICU\nHonorary Secretary Dave Colley and\nUnion Bar Manager Kev Buckley was\na resounding success. Much of the\nsuccess Imperial has enjoyed with its\nAmerican counterparts is due to the\nefforts of Dave Colley who spent a good deal of time during the summer\ncommunicating with the Americans\nand getting them linked together.\n\n"

Each week\nthere's a \u00a35 prize for a randomly\nselected winner picked after 1.00pm Wednesday, although this deadline\nchanges occasionally. The puzzles\nvary in difficulty and type so don't give up if you find any particular\nproblem too hard. I always need\npuzzles, so if you know any kind of\nproblem that would be suitable\nwrite it down with your name and\nhand it in. All solutions and new\npuzzles should be given in at the\nFELIX office.\nRoom Roulette\nIan Visible, the sub warden of\nNewt Hall, Priceless Gardens, is\nhaving more than his fair share of\nBeginning-of-year hassles. Eight\nfresher s: Stuart, Tina, Ursula,\nVanessa, William, Xavier, Yvonne,\nand Zack; checking the hall picture\nboard, have discovered that they're\nin the wrong rooms. Instead of\nsorting it out by themselves, they've\nleft Ian this set of rather cryptic\nnotes.\n'I'm in the room of the person\nwho's in the room of the person\nwho's in the room of the person\nwho's in the room of the person in\nmy room. Please sort this out.\nStuart'.\n'I'm in the room of the person\nwho's in the room of the person in\nXavier's room. What should I do?\nYvonne.'\n'I'm in the room of the person\nwho's in the room of the person in\nmy room. Are you going to do\nanything about it? Tina.'\nThere were also three other\nunsigned notes, no two from the\nsame person (judging by the\nhandwriting) which all said 'I am in\nthe room next to the room I'm meant to be in.' But Ursula,who was\na friend of Ian's, said that she had\nnot written any of the notes.\nGiven that the students should be\nin the rooms, which are side-by-side\nin a line, in alphabetical order, can\nyou tell who's in whose room?\nUnion Bar The Union Bar in Beit has been\ntaken over by Imperial College\nUnion and a new manager Kevin\nBuckley has been appointed. The\nthree permanent members of staff\nwere all students at one time and as\nsuch know the special needs of the\nImperial College members. They\nare keen to emphasise that bawdy\nbar nights are the exception rather\nthan the rule and that the main bar\nis a great place to meet for a beer. If\nyou do wish to watch television\nthen the brand new Lounge Bar is\navailable next door. There is a large\nselection of beers plus all manner of\nspirits and soft drinks and because\nit's owned by your Union, all the\nprofit is yours eventually.\nAny complaints you may have\nshould be taken first to the Bar\nManager rather than directly to a Sabbatical as stated in the\nHandbook and any constructive\nsuggestions will be gratefully\nreceived.\n\\ X3 Ck STROKE FILO FAX The creators of the illustrious\nFILO FAX, the invaluable\naccessory for every businessman,\naccountant and professional\nposeur, have announced the latest\naddition to their range of products.\nThe makers have been swamped by\nletters from people who don't have\nenough addresses to fill their new\nacquisitions and have to cope with\nthe spectacle of showing off\nembarrassing white spaces when\nthey open it up to look for a phone\nnumber. To cope with this problem\nthey have brought out packets of\nspecially created false addresses.\nThe packages are available in a range of handwriting styles to match\nyour own. Choose from styles like\n'Neat Capitals', 'Secondary School',\n'Spidery' and 'Doctor'. Each\npackage is individually band crafted\nby specialists, and comes complete\nwith instructions explaining exactly\nwho each person is, and the size of\ntheir expense account.\nAt \u00a330 per 20 pages the package is\na real snip for the image conscious\neighties.\nSO NO Walkman SONO have recently lau ched the\nlatest in a range of Walkmans,\nspecially designed for all those\npeople on the tube who have to\nreally strain to listen to the Level 42\nalbum being played by the person in\nthe next seat.\nA spokesman from SONO told\nus. \"The problem lies with the\nspeakers of a Walkman being fitted\ninto the ears of the person wearing\nit. This means that the public all\naround can only hear a tinny sort of\ntish-pop-tush sound all the time,\nwhich for a generation raised on\ncompact discs and 10 inch woofers\njust isn't good enough. Even adding\na graphic equalizer doesn't alleviate\nthe problem.\"\nSONO have neatly circumvented\nthe quality problem by making the\nspeakers 10 times larger and taking\nthe unprecedented step of fixing\nthem to the cassette recorder itself,\nrather than to the owner's head. To\ncope with the much larger bulk of\nthe new Walkman, SONO have also\nhad to devise a totally new system of\ncarrying the unit. They have so far\nfailed to come up with a proper\nname for this, and are currently\nexperimenting with the term\n'handle'.\n\"We believe that the GTOBLSTR 1 is a major breakthrough\nin the design of Walkman public\naddress systems,\" say SONO.\n\n"

This adaption by Steven Berkoff\nof Kafka's classic story of mans' self-debasement is near perfect. The\nalienation and divorce ment from\nreality of characters and plot allow\nKafka/Berkoff to strike with purity\nat the centre of mans' soul;\nrevealing all.\nThe unfortunate Gregor awakes\nearly one morning to find that he\ncan not leave for work in order to\nearn for his needy parents and\nsister, since he has started to\nmetamorphose into a Dung Beetle.\nGregor's transformation is soon\ndiscovered by his family and the\neffect this has on them is explored\nas their feelings change from pain\nand anguish to disgust and\ndisinterest. Finally, rejected and\nwounded by his father, Gregor is\nleft to die.\nOn a climbing frame set which\nradiates from his bedroom Tim\nRoth as Gregor shows an agility and\nintensity of performance that soak\nhis supporting characters in a 'light'\nthat burns very bright. Similarly,\nBerkoffs direction and control over\nthe action is masterful and precise.\nThe fine detail of all the performers\nis beautifully simple and\nunderstated.\nSimon Lewis METAMORPHOSIS\nBOUNCERS....\n(Congratulations Hugh and\nJackie...Simon et al.)\nHave you noticed how stale\ncomedy seems to be at present.\nThe other night I sat at home and\nwatched TV for the first time in\nages. Britains 'radical' Channel 4\nwas showing a comedy called 'A Fairly Secret Army'. 1 have rarely\nbeen more bored. The programme\nwas meant to be 'Guardian\ncredible' as it was about a bunch of\nfac is t buffoons who form an army.\nI'd be surprised if anyone found it\nbelievable. It was flat, dry and\nunimaginative. The problem with\ncomedy seems to be that there is\nlittle new material that is original\nthat people can relate too. This is\nwhy a trip to Bouncers (Arts\nTheatre) is so worthwhile.\nBouncers is about a small town\nnightclub and anyone who has\nbeen to Bentley's in Stockton or\nBogart's in Harrow or any other\nsmall town nightclub will relate to\nthe play. All types of people are\nportrayed: The under aged girls'on\nthe pill'; the 'pissed up lads'; the\ncollege rugby players and the\nsmoothies with cars. Although Hull\nTruck's production makes you\nlaugh at all these characters, it is\nalso sympathetic and warm to\nthem. It's very easy to laugh at\nst ero types because the images\npresented make you feel superior\nand safe, but Hull Truck avoid this.\nWhen you think about the\ncharacters you find yourself\nidentifying with them.\nBouncers is a great night out.\nHugh Southey "

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday September 29 1986 5\nMerger Moves\nIn May FELIX revealed that discussions were underway\nabout a merger with St Marys Medical School. Imperial\nhas been the possible subject of mergers before. But\nthis time it looks as if there is a real chance of students\nentering the College this year witnessing the greatest\nchange in its history for over 70 years.\nA New Constituent\nCollege for IC?\n' So what is St Marys actually like,\nand how do they view a merger with\nImperial College? In basic factual\nterms St Marys is a college of\napproximately 500 students who are\nall taking a5 year course in\nMedicine. It is situated in Praed\nStreet, fairly near to Edgeware Road\ntube station. Students are divided\nroughly fifty fifty between male and\nfemale, and about half find\naccommodation in the School's own\nhall of residence. The School was\nfounded in 1854 and finally became separate from St Mary's Hospital\nunder the 1948 National Health\nService Act. During its long and\ndistinguished history it has seen\nconsiderable changes in its\nbuildings which are continuing\ntoday with the construction of a new\nwing, and in 1928 Sir Alexander\nFleming discovered pencil lin there.\nDay to day administration is in\nthe hands of Secretary Keith\nLockyer who is very much the\nequivalent of the IC College\nSecretary John Smith. A jovial Mr\nLockyer interrupted a busy schedule\nto give me a guided tour of some of\nthe school's facilities. He is\nextremely enthusiastic about the\npossibilities of academic links and\nalso about the benefits for students.\nHe explained the background to the\nmerger proposals over a mug of\nmilk and a biscuit. In 1969 a document called the Todd Report\nrecommended that the London\nMedical Schools would benefit from\nlinks with multi-disciplinary\ncolleges. The Todd proposals\nthemselves have been abandoned\nbut the problems recognised by that\nreport are still relevant and were\nvery much in the mind of Prof Peter\nRichards, the Dean of St Mary's when he approached the Rector of\nIC. It is not insignificant that Prof\nAsh has come from UCL, which is\nlinked to UCH medical school, and\nit is believed that the experience of\nthis has led the Rector to view a merger as a possibility.\nA working party has been set up\nto produce detailed proposals for a merger and is due to report by next\nsummer. There are four sub-groups\nwith detailed briefs to investigate,\namong other things, Student Unions\nand Services. If a merger is to take\nplace it will have to occur at the\nbeginning of a financial year and\nbecause an act of parliament will be\nrequired to di solve St Mary's and\nincorporate it into IC the likely\ntarget date is 1st August 1988.\nIt is impossible to draw accurate\nparallels at this stage, but the\ncurrent proposals seem to envisage\nSt Marys becoming essentially a fourth constituent college. The\ndepartment at Imperial to be most\naffected by a merger would be Life\nSciences. Indeed a merger has been\ndescribed as a way of enlarging Life\nSci while circumventing the\nproblems of space and money.\nFrom St Marys' point of view they\nbelieve a large institution such as\nImperial with a similar standing to\nthemselves in its respective\ndisciplines will enable them to\nexploit their research better.\nPotential multi-disciplinary fields\ninclude the dev elopement of\nsurgical tech nn ology and\nbiochemical technology. There are\nunlikely to be vast changes to\nundergraduate courses at first.\nOn the non-academic side a merger could cause some more\ninteresting changes. The size of St\nMarys means that it cannot afford\nto run Student Services on the scale\nof IC and its Union does not have\nany sabbatical officers. I spoke to Jo\nOsborne (Treasurer) and Ruth\nCharlton (Assisant Social Secretary)\nin the Union Office who were both\ncautiously optimistic but said they\nhad not yet seen any proposals on\nwhich they could comment. They\ndescribed the course they follow and\nthe way it affects student life. The\nin to IC or indeed whether they will\nwant to is a question which is sure to\nsee considerable discussion. It is\ninteresting to note that like most\nMedical Schools, St Mary's are not\naffiliated to the NUS; they are\nhowever members of ULU and the\nNational Student Services\nOrganisation.\nThe proximity of St Mary's means it would be quite feasible for\nIC students to live in St Mary's Wilson House residences and\nmedical students to live here. The\nsplit location is similar in some ways\nfirst two years follow fairly normal\nuniversity terms after which there\nare three years clinical training\nwhich can often take students to\nother hospitals such as the Central\nMiddlesex or the Royal Berkshire\nand involves a heavy workload. This\n.means that union events which\nculminate with the May Ball and\nRag Week at the beginning of\nMarch are mostly supported by first\nand second years. St Marys are\nparticularly proud of their Rugby\nclub which has a formidable\nreputation and has produced stars\nsuch as J PR Williams and Kevin\nSims. How St Mary's Union will fit\nto Southampton University Medical\nSchool. Keith Lockyer seemed\nimpressed by IC Student Services\nand Welfare facilities but was keen\nto emphasise that St Mary's don't expect to generate a heavy net\nburden. The first meeting of the\nStudent and Services Sub-group is\nexpected to be in the next few weeks\nand proposals will hopefully\nbecome clearer then. The timetable\nand the enthusiasm shown by the\nacademics will mean that the\nstudent unions could have a substantial task on their hands in\nthe very near future.\nMark Cottle\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\n\"No Places\" Policy\nStudent Services have been forced to adopt a \"no\nplaces for home postgraduates\" policy owing to the\nhigh demand for a reduced number of rooms in\nCollege accommodation. Since the beginning of\nSeptember it has been clear that some of the students\nwho are normally allocated places would have to look\nto the private sector. In addition, an increased\nnumber of first year undergraduates have been given\nplaces in head tenancy flats this year.\nIn total there are 1,400 spaces\navailable in College Halls and\nHouses. This figure represents a drop of about 30 from last year.\nStudent Services will expect to gain\na small number of places as\naccommodation becomes available\nduring the next few months. All\nundergraduate Freshers who\nqualify as \"away from home\" are\nawarded a single, double or triple\nroom. In addition, all overseas\npostgraduate Freshers are\nguaranteed places if they apply\nwhen invited to do so. In previous\nyears, 40 of places available to\npostgraduates have been given to\nhome students, and 160 to students\nfrom overseas. Because of the fierce\ndemand, only 3 of the 100-150\nhome postgraduates who applied\nand who were eligible for places\nhave received them; the remainder\nof the 200 have been taken up by\noverseas students who have\npriority.\nThe squeeze on College Halls\nand Houses is certain to create\nmore pressure for more College\naccommodation to be found. There\nare plans to build a new Hall above\nthe IC Sports Centre in Princes\nGardens, though the source of\nfunds for this has yet to be agreed.\nThose who are having difficulty\nin finding a place to stay are\nadvised to see Student Services\ntoday.\nTransport Committee Reveal Plans To Avert\nAccommodation Crisis. See Page 24.\nSecond Time Around\nFor the second year running, frantic\nwork was carried out in the last\nweek of the Summer Vacation in an\neffort to get two of the Houses in\nEvelyn Gardens ready for the\narrival of students. Both Holbein\nand Southwell Houses have been\nundergoing alteration and\ndecoration work similar to that\ncarried out on Willis Jackson House\ntwelve months ago, as part of a rolling programme of work to bring\nEvelyn Gardens into line with\nhousing regulations.\nPeter Hallworth, Managing\nSurveyor of Residences, said on\nFriday that the work was only\n'substantially complete', though, he\nwas confident that no student would\nbe asked to accept sub-standard\naccommodation. He said that the\nprogramme of work exceeded the\nstatutory alterations and had\nincluded extensive re decoration as\nwell as some re flooring. He added\nthat there were lessons to be learnt\nfrom the situation and that the scale\nof the work had been over-ambitious.\nMr Hallworth explained that it\nwas impossible to carry out the\nnecessary alterations other than at\nEaster and during the long vacation\nand hence the time available was\nlimited. It 'had been decided,\nhowever, to raise the standard ofthe\naccommodation and include the\nextra work.

    "content": "FILMS\nFELIX, Friday September 29 1986 1 9\nBecause film making is such a collaborative activity their are\nmany occasion when some\ncompromise is required between\nthe unions of the various\ncontributors. According to writer\nNicholas Kazan and producer\nElliot Lewitt their original intention\nfor At Close Range is very\ndifferent from director James\nFoley, and actor Sean Penn's final\nproduct. It is obviously impossible\nto judge the film that has never\nmade so I can only comment on the\nversion now on release and it does\nnot apear to be as bad as Kazen\nand Lewitt would have it.\nThe film is another example of\nthe incredible behaviour of one\nindividual. It tells the tale of a young\nman's attempt to emulate his\ncriminal father by forming his own\ngang and committing fairly petty\ncrimes. However.when the son's incompetence and knowledge\nbecomes dangerous to the father\nhe sets about eliminating the boy's gang and finally, puts a$15,000 AT CLOSE RANGE\ncontract out on his son's life.\nWhat is particularly remak able about the story is that all the\nimportant plot elements are based\non the real life exploits of Bruce\nJohnson Sr.\nAthough the 'Greek tragedy'\nnature has been played down,\nwhich results in a rather superficial\nfilm. It is nevertheless a powerful\nstory with some wonderful\nphotography in which both Sean\nPenn and Christopher Walke are\nallowed to exploit their\nconsiderable talents. It is a shame\nhowever that the most interesting\ncharacter played by Walke, is not\n\u2022allowed suffice rit time to develop\nand that this part is sacrificed in\norder that Sean Penn remains the\nstar. As Nicholas Kazan pointed\nout when he asked the distributors\nif he could re-edit the film at his\nown expense: 'Would you rather\n, riau ea bad film which Sean Penn\nlikes or a good film which he\ndoesn't'. Such is the power of\nyoung actors.\n....BRIEFLY\nTROUBLE\nOne way of avoiding clashes\nbetween writer and director is for\none person to do both and this is\nAlan Rudolph'sp refered way of\nworking. In order to achieve this\nhis tendency is to make budget\nfilms, often independently.\nHowever, his latest film, Trouble\nin Mind is a studio production,\nalbeit a relatively cheap one as\nHollywood films go. It is set a short\ntime in the future and is an essay in\nthe corrupting nature of the 'City'\nas Coop (Keith Carradine) says\nbefore he even goes to 'Rain City',\n'I 've been to plenty of cities and\nthey aren't nothing but trouble.'\nSure enough when he gets there\nwith his partner and child he is\nslowly drawn into the slee zy underworld. Alan Rudolph's greatest achievement is creating a fantasy world full of exotic\ncharacters and bizarre occur en ces and yet at the same time manages\nto keep the whole story credible\nand involving. He also had a nice\nway with words saving most of the\nbest lines for the sometime hero\nHawk, Kris Kristofferson, who\ngives a marvellous performance as\nan ex-cop, ex-convict and a man\ndestined to clash with Rain City's King of Crime, Billy Blue.\nThe script also allows for some\ninteresting and independent\nfemale characters. Wanda, a cafe\nowner excellently played by\nGenevieve Bujold and Lori Singer\nslightly less well played as Keith\nCarradine's partner. An\nentertaining film, and any film with\na song that contains the line, 'one\nlove is only found down in your\npants', can't be all bad.\nThe Legend of Swan Fortress\nis a Russian film directed by\nParadjanor, who also directed the\na claimed The Colour of\nPomegrantes. Because Russia\nrarely has many Western films to\ncompare it's film industry with, it\nhas developed along poetic and\nsculptural lines independent of\nAmerican narrative style film. As a result Russian films are very\ndifficult to watch and appear very\nslow. This one concerns the folk\ntale of Swan Fortress which would\nonly remain standing when\nsomeone was walled up in the\nfoundations is unfortunately no\nexception, and it certainly isn't helped by some poor photography.\nThe Decline of the American\nEmpire is a French-Canadian\nadult comedy. It concerns the\nactivities of a group of well\neducated middle-aged men and\nwomen discussing their sexual\nhang ups, and as such is a fairly\nannoying and unfunny exercise,\nparticularly because all the\ncharacters are wholly un sym pathetic.\nGirl in a Boot is a rather sweet\ntale of a E. German girl who falls in\nlove with a chef who works at the\nSwiss Embassy and follows their\nadventure when they decide to\ntake day trips over to the West. A nice little story with a not\nsufficiently powerful sad ending.\nInvaders from Mars is a remake of the 1953 version and as\nsuch is a good insight into the way\nin which society and science has\nmoved on since that period.\nAlthough attempts are made to\nmodernise the story, by suggesting\nthat the Martian probes launched\nin the 70's actually found\nsomething but that this was\nhushed up. The film is really weak\nand it is apparent from a couple of\nmoments that it fails to .generate\nthe laughter intended. The story\nconcerns the attempts of a young\nboy to alert the world to the evil\nactivities of a spaceship that lands\nnear his house, these effort are\nthwarted by the fact that the\nMartians keep 'hy p not ising' the\nlocals. The original film was very\nmuch a product of it's age and\nshould never have been remade.\nPoltergeist 2, Oh dear. Once\nagain the Freeling family are\nto u bled by bumps in the night and\nmanic preachers. Apart from some\ngood lines by the father, Craig T Nelson, this is an em barra sing and\nappalling film with one of the least\ncredible monsters I have ever seen.\nStill it did good bus in es in the\nStates so what do I know.\nJim Clayden\n\n"

The original date of\ncompletion agreed with the\ncontractors was August 31st, and\nthe building work has been\nrescheduled several times during\nSeptember. The move of the office is\nnow likely to last for a number of\nweeks, in order to allow the\nproduction of FELIX to proceed.\nThe majority of this issue has been\nprinted outside the Union Print\nUnit, because of technical\ndifficulties imposed by the\nimpending move. The new FELIX\nOffice has been converted from the\nderelict kitchens behind the Lounge,\npreviously the Union Lower\nRefectory. FELIX has been situated\nin Beit archway, in rooms which\nwere formally the IC Union Office,\nsince the acquisition of the Print\nUnit in 1974. The FELIX editorship\nhas been a full sabbatical since that\ndate.\nRCS Office Move\nThe Royal College of Science\nUnion office, currently situated in\nSouthside, may be moving. After\nmajor building work, which made\naccess impossible unless students\npossessed keys to Southside Halls\nof residence, College offered a new\nsite in Chemistry. The proposed\nroom is the timber store which is\nlocated directly over the Motor\nClub garage and which is twice as\nlarge as the present site. It also\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY'S GARAGE( Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE MEWS SOUTH KENSINGTON LONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\noffers 24 hour access. RCSU\nofficers, however, are concerned\nabout the old Chemistry block\nbeing demolished in the near\nfuture. They hope to have the issue\ndiscussed at the next UGM.\nThe timber store is being cleared\nto give RCSU officers the\nopportunity of inspecting the\nproposed site. Students are advised\nnot to park their cars in the vicinity\nof the store. (See pages 1 and 24).\nDES Course\nThe Government has announced a study to evaluate and develop\nleadership courses for senior\nuniversity staff. The study, for\nwhich the DES is providing\n\u00a337,126 over two years, will take\nplace at Surrey University. Its\npurpose is to evaluate the\nprogramme of leadership courses\nalready being run at Surrey and to\nresearch how they may be\nextended. It will also develop new\ncourses in finance, marketing and\nstaff development.\nAccommodation\nOnce again term has begun with a mad rush to get Houses in Evelyn\nGardens is-sid y for first year students\nto move into. At the same time the\nstaff of <\nJie Student Services Office\nhave had to work exceptionally hard\nin order to accommodate all those\nstudents who are guaranteed places in\nCollege Halls, Houses and Head\nTenancies. If only a handful more\n'entitled' students had applied,\nStudent Services would have had little\noption but to turn them down.\nI accept that the College is, to a certain extent, at the mercy of the\ncontractors where the alteration work\nis concerned, but that the same\nsituation should arise two years\nrunning is indicative of lu e administration's unconcerned\nattitude. It is intolerable that the\nEvelyn Gardens Wardens and re-apps\nshould be landed with the job of\nclearing up the Houses overnight, so\nas to make them habitable for\nFreshers, and, more significantly\nperhaps, to avoid distressing parents.\nBy the same token, the Student\nServices office should not be\ncontinually expected to cope with the\nincreasingly impossible task of\nfinding enough places.\nI suggest to College once more\nthat, until such issues as the\ninadequate provision of student\naccommodation are resolved, no\namount of professional publicity will\nprevent a deterioration in the quality\nand quantity of applicants to the\nCollege.\nBarclays Issue\nThose of you who are first year\nstudents will have received a copy of\nthis year's ICU Handbook, including\nan insert by Christine Taig (ICU\nPresident), Jackie Peirce (Deputy\nPresident), Hugh Southey (UGM\nChairman) and Mark Cottle\n(External Affairs Officer). At the\ntime of the last FELIX I was unaware\nthat the decision to include this\nhandout was not one made by the\nICU Executive. I repeat my\nune qu ivica l support for the sentiment\nof this insert, and for the UGM\nmotion on Barclays, but I am\nextremely unhappy over the manner\nin which this decision was taken. Had\nChristine and Jackie chosen to\nexecute the Exec's power of veto at\nthe correct time, they would have\nacted entirely correctly, albeit in\nanticipation (I hope) of Union Policy.\nEven at the late stage when the insert\nwas included they would have been\nable to give the leaflet more force by\nbacking it with an official Exec\ndecision, a majority one if necessary.\nAs it stands a Union publication has\nbeen used as a vehicle for a political\nleaflet pro u u ced by four prominent\nstudents, with no formal Union\napproval.\nI concede that this is a procedural\nargument only, but I would\nrecommend that such decisions are\nformalised in future. I look forward to\na year of enlightened debate within\nIC Union.\nFELIX\nFELIX is one of the very few student\nnewspapers to be produced and\nprinted entirely 'in-house'. The\ncontent, layout and design are\nexclusively the responsibility of the\nsi., tent staff and sabbatical editor.\nFor FELIX to flourish, and it is\nimperative to a prosperous Union\nthat it does, we need a large student\nstaff who are interested in\ncontributing to their newspaper. We\nshall be opening the Office on\nTuesday afternoon during Freshers'\nFair, so visit FELIX and we'll show\nyou a little of how the paper works.\nOn Thursday evening we will be\nholding our first \"Social Event\" of\nthe year, which includes the Editor\nbuying drinks for everyone who turns\nup to collate. This should start at\nabout 8pm, so give the frantic rush of\nFreshers' Week a miss and come\nalong. There will be a staff meeting\nfor anyone who is interested in\nworking on the paper at 12.30pm on\nFriday, October 3. If you would like\nto write, draw, take photographs,\ndesign pages or mind the folding\nmachine, please try to be there.\nCredits\nIf this issue comes out at all it will be\ndue to the incredible hard work and\ntolerance of a group of people who\nhave yet to tire of my\nun profesional is m. Particular thanks\nto Chris Edwards, Judith Hackney\nand Mark Cottle who have been\nlargely responsible for the\npublication of this FELIX as well as\nboth the previous ones.
