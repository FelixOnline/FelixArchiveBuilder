Hence the scheme to increase hall rents to\nfinance new accommodation. A report will go to the college\nStudent Residents Committee. There is also a real chance of\nU.S.K. co-operation over the lodgings bureau.\nPostgrads\nBig problem here \u2014 isolation in labs, lack of com-muni cation, un interest(?) \u2014 pg's have their own troubles.\nMeetings are being arranged to discuss department organ iz a tion, M.

ICU has been to the\nforefront of moves in NUS to put the post-graduates case.\nUnion fee (increased)\nUnion finances will be tight till 1972 \u2014 when the fee\nshould be increased to \u00a310 from \u00a36 (not \u00a37), due to recent\nnegotiations. Increased revenue from the bookshop (both\nICU and constituent colleges) \u2014 thanks to Dr. Weale \u2014\nmeans there should be \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 slack for next years\nexpansion. Not adequate but not poverty. The constituent\ncolleges, due to their Bookshop money, even show an increased income, despite earlier cuts.\nDiscipline\nAttempts to formulate a discipline code have dragged\non for years. The original college proposals have been modified by council (May) and further, in light of new information (including a model code from the N. C.C.L.) by a recent\nmeeting.

Very urgent, as food prices increase\nat a rate of 15%, wages at 9% \u2014 the source must be streamlined if prices are to be reasonable.\nRents, food costs etc. may go up \u2014 but grants don't. National grants campaign in the spring. Both college admin\nand the Young Socialists (S. L.C.) are agreed that the Tories\nwill cut back further on higher education \u2014 beware no ex-pan sion, and selective loans.

Nine of us set out in the\nvan for Cornwall on the first\nexpedition by the club without aqualung s \u2014not a very\nsunny day but good weather\nfor surfing with about four\nfoot of swell at Newquay.\nAs if getting up at eight\no 'clock on a Saturday morning wasn't strenuous enough\nwe averaged about five hours\nin the water each on both\nSaturday and Sunday. We\nwere warm enough thanks\nto adequate wet suits but it\nwasn't really the weather for\nlooking \"trendy\" on the\nbeach. You've doubtless seen\npictures of people riding in well the big catch is paddling\nout through the white water,\nvery hard on the shoulder\nmuscles and very de moral is ing when that extra big wave\ntakes you all the way in\nagain.\nRiding a board is far more\nexciting than any description I could give, and contrary to the popular belief it\nis not a substitute for sex\n(it's better!\u2014J. A.). Beginners\nfound that they could stand\nup on the white-water waves\ntowards the end of the first\nday and by Sunday they\ndidn't fall off quite so much\nand got some great rides.\nAt this stage the bug gets\nhold of you and you keep on\ngoing out to get a better\nwave than the one before. On\nSunday the swell got up to\nsix feet and with more control of the board, longer,\nfaster rides were possible.\nHowever, if the surf catches\nyou a heavy wipe-out can\nmean a pounding and a long\nswim to collect your board on\nthe shore.\nA note about our boards:\nfour of them were hired from\n\"Tig Surfboards\", Treyarnon\nBay\u2014they're the best boards\navailable\u2014and three belonged to Jon Austin our surfing\ninstructor.\nThe whole weekend cost\n\u00a34 per person. If you're interested in surfing at week nds or on longer trips at Christmas and Easter, whether\nyou're a beginner or an ex-pert, contact Jon in 273\nKeogh or myself in 634 Linstead.\nMIKE PEARSON WINKS . . . A good and entertaining 'race' from Marble Arch to Piccadilly Circus began with an exhibitionist ie crew from Mines taking up the middle of Oxford Street, with\nGuilds and RCS on either flank.\nAfter many entertaining and necessary detours from the assigned route, especially a short-cut across Oxford Circus (dia gon ailly), the win kers arrived in Piccadilly Circus (minus\na few fingers) and assembled outside the Cockney Pride for lunch. They were not accompanied by D. Taylor Esq., who insisted on going to West End Central Police Station for\nhis (see photograph). It later cost him five shillings.\nLongest Wink \u2014 took place in Woolworths up an escalator.\nFastest Wink \u2014 somebody from Civil I. IRC\nFrom this\nnewsletter \u2014\nweek's IRC \"The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 is one of\nthe most racialist ic and discriminatory acts per pert rated by the British government in recent years. As an\nAfrikaner Principal of Capetown University had it, \"the\nthree things which human\nbeings desire most are\nsecurity, happiness and res-pec t. Most of all, respect.\nRespect for their persons,\ntheir possessions, their feel-in gs, their beliefs, their\ndignity.\" The act is meant\nto strip them of all this and\nsubject them to degrading\nhumi la tion. The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines \"Pass-port\" as \"a formal document . . . identifying a traveller as a citizen or a national\nwith a right to return to that\nnation. The thousands of\nKenyan Asians holding British passports are now denied\nthis right be o a use of the\nA HUMANIST\nPOINT OF VIEW\nThe Humanist Approach is that man must face his\nproblems with his own moral and intellectual resources, without looking for supernatural aid. Our concern should be with\nthis life \u2014 to try and make it worthwhile and sufficient in\nitself. Humanism makes no claim to special knowledge or\nfinal truth, although truth is the goal ait which the Humanist\nalways aims. In other words Humanism is based on the\nscientific method, but with a full-blooded acceptance and\nappreciation of music, the arts, and beauty.\nThe Open Society. People with adult minds should be\nas free as possible to choose what to make of their lives,\nbut there is no right to injure other individuals or the community in the process. Groups of individuals also have this\nright to be as free as possible and to convert each other to\ntheir respective points of view. But neither a few individuals,\nnor groups of individuals, can be allowed to take over the\ncommunity as some religious and political bodies have done,\nand in some places still do. Society must be organised for\nthe good of all: a group is free to persuade but not to impose.\nThis is why Humanists so strongly oppose laws based on the\nunwarranted assumption that \"Britain is a Christian Country.\"\nPrivate and Sexual Morality. The over-riding aim of the\nHumanist's actions is human happiness and fulfillment: his\nown and that of others. Man can behave in an honorable\nand considerate way towards his fellow men without reference to divine commandment.\nThere is no generally agreed Humanist code of sexual\nmorality, although most Humanists would agree with the\npersonal approach below. Morality is to serve human beings\nby making life as pleasant as possible for everybody. Sexual\nmorality is just an e xter it ion of general morality, not an\nawesome special field. The purpose of love making is physical\nenjoyment. People can do it for other purposes, such as\nto get pregnant, to make money, to express a relationship\nor just to prove they can. Great harm is caused by people\nwho kid themselves that one of these subsidiary purposes is\nthe main, sole, or \"proper\" purpose of lovemaking. It is\nright for people to have Children when they want them \u2014\nother wii se it is wrong. To force people to produce children\nwho don't want to is an atrocity.\nAnd finally the Christian view is well-stated in Imperial\nCollege . . . there are alternatives. Very soon there should be\nan active Humanist Society in college. Humanism has exciting implications for society, politics, technology, and morality:\nit should be represented in Imperial College.\nGeoff Needham\ncolour of their skin.\nSpeaking of these Asians,\none learns that they were\nurged at i the time of independence to take up British\nNationality by the British\nGovernment and because of\nthis they are being treated in\na most dehumanizing manner both in Kenya and here\nin Britain.\nIn Kenya, the British\nAsians are not allowed jobs,\neducation or housing and\nmany of them are almost\ndestitute. They cannot be regarded as refugees and so\nUNCTAD cannot step in to\nhelp them. In Britain they\nare either \"shuttlecocks\" or\nallowed to languish in pri-son. Even babies and infants\nare not exempt from this inhumane treatment.\"\nA petition is being organised calling for the repeal\nof Clause 1. of i the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968.\nLook in at Falmouth 335\nany lunchtime and sign.\nK nr niv nl Walk \u2014\nThis year's incredible short stroll of just over 'twenty six\nmiles starts from IC UNION ARCH( old snack bar) from 11\np.m. onwards, on Friday 27th November. For the uninitiated,\nthe walk last year made close on a thousand pounds, and\nthe idea is for each walker to be sponsored by as many\npeople as possible. Marshals in a more modern form of transport will be circumnavigating the route, picking up any\ndrop-outs/drunks, etc. who feel they can't walk any further.\nAs an appetizer to this trial of human(e) endurance,\nthere will be a pre-walk party, dance or whatever at the\nInstitut Francais, just to tire everybody out, wilt haUS K Carnival Queen competition thrown in for good measure.\nExplanation of Map (for those without microscopes).\nBriefly the route meanders from Prince Consort Road\n\u2014 High St. Ken., Kensington Church Street, Bayswater\nRoad, Ladbroke Grove, Harrow Road, Wembley Central,\nSudbury Hill, Uxbridge Road, Acton Town, Shepherds\nBush, Holland Road and hopefully back to IC Union Arch\nand the lower refectory where a free breakfast will be pro-vi ded, courtesy of Maria Assumpta and French Institute.\nThere's a just reward of \u00a310 for the best sponsored walker.\nCARNIVAL\nWALK 70\nTotal Distance = 26.1 Miles\n* - Propoised refreshment\nPoint\n\u2022 = Tube stations\n= Direction of walk\n(26) = Page no in \"A to Z\" London\n\n"

Both Guilds\nand R.C.S. got off to a good start while Mines\nrapidly fell behind and never looked like improving\ntheir position.

Their gamble payed off and they managed\nto pull ahead to win by two lengths over R.G. S. The second race, for the Morphy Cup, was very much a one-sided affair. Guilds with several top\nclass oarsmen in their crew, were augmented by a masterly course taken by their hitherto unknown\ncox to win by a very wide margin and so complete\nthe \"double\".

C. Willcock putting them ahead after twenty minutes. However ten minutes before half time\nright back P. Worthington, a vital man in I.C.'s defence had to leave the field due to an\nankle injury. Goldsmiths\nseized this chance to get\nback into the game, they attacked down the vacant wing\nand promptly scored. This\ngoal and Goldsmiths obvious\nenthusiasm seemed to destroy I.C.'s ten men, and for\nthe rest of the first half they\nwere under very heavy pre s sure.\nIn the second half I.C. became frantic in their efforts\nto get the winner, this proved to be their undoing as\nGoldsmiths seized the midfield vacated by Dinon and\nWillcock and pushed forward to add another three\ngoals with only one lucky\ngoal in reply from I.C.A significant point in this game\nwas the unsettling of Darley\nand Barnard by the two\nboisterous front runners of\nGoldsmiths. These two I.C. men were pushed and shoved unfairly when going for\nthe ball and receiving no help\nfrom the referee were forced to give the opposition\ntheir fair share of punishment legal or illegal.\nA disappointing game for\nI.C. but with eleven fit men\nI think it will take a good\nside to beat them.\nAll out for winter eights\nAs the Boat Club settles\ndown to serious winter training all our efforts are directed towards winning trophies\nat the University of London\nWinter Eights Regatta, to be\nheld on 28th November. At this stage of the year much\nmileage is covered in order\nto weld the crews into efficient units. However there is\nno substitute for the experience gained from hard rac-ing. Apart from the long-distance Head of the River\nRaces in the Spring, there\nare few competitive events to\naim for until the Summer.\nWe therefore take every opportunity seriously.\nMorphy Day provides\nanother diversion. Constituent College rowing outwardly seems just as serious\nbut an air of festivity is apparent to all those involved.\nThe Races for the Morphy\nand Lowry Cups are rowed\nbetween the constituent college first and second eights\nrespectively. They attract\nmany important College\npersonalities who tackle their\nvarious pursuits with gay\nabandon. The Boat Club\nDinner is held in the evening and with many prominent rowing personalities\npresent it provides even\nmore gay abandon.\nIn the midst of all this\nactivity, we are still accepting new members at Putney,\nOarsmen of any status can\nbe accommodated and are\nwelcome. This year's beginners look very promising\nand are progressing well, but\nwe have room for more. In\nparticular we are looking for\nlightweight, intelligent, outdoor types to act as cox es. Any-one needing further information concerning the\nClub should contact Dave\nSorton (67 Weeks Hall) or\n'phone 788-4648 at any hour\nof the day or night.\nCricket\nAppeal\nEvery Sunday, during\nhe nm time, the cricket club\nholds indoor winter net\npractices at Cover's Cricket\nSchool in Wandsworth. These\nnets are basically to introduce new members to the\nclub, as well as to provide\npractice for the players. Any\nmember of I.C. who has not\njoined the cricket club yet,\nbut would be interested in\nplaying during the summer,\nshould either give his name\nto Russ Smith (Linstead 127)\nor just come along on any\nSunday afternoon to the\nlower lounge of the Union\nat 3 p.m.( bringing just a pair\nof p lim so ll s). No matter how\ngood or bad you are, we will\nhave a team catering for your\nstandard, so come along.\nLacrosse\nI.C. vs. Lee 'B' Score 6-6\nIn the first round of the\nflags knock-out tournament\nImperial College were drawn\nhome to Lee 'B'. After an uncertain start,\nwe recovered to lead 3-2 at\nthe end of the second qua r ter. Lee came back strongly\nin the third quarter, and it\nwas mainly due to the good\nplays of goalkeeper J. Kurkis that we held Lee to a66 draw. Goalscorers were:\nT. Smith (2), K. Noble (2),\nB. Staples and P. Drury.

The 2nd men's team secured their\nplace in div. 2 and will do\nas well (we hope better) this\nseason. The mixed came 2nd last season due to un sport ing-goings-on in Colleges\nwhich will remain nameless.\nThis year there is NO DOUBT IC WILL WIN THE MIXED along with\nMuhammed Ali killing Joe\nFrazier. The ladies too (let's not forget them) have started off brilliantly this season\nby thrashing Kings 9-0.\nLast year B.U.S. F. ladies\nsingles and men's doubles\nwere won by Lynn Beynon\n(Chem. Ill) S.K. Donald\n(Maths P.G.) and G.A. Georgiou (Maths II) respectively. Naturally they have been\nselected this year to defend\ntheir titles along with Sue\nThompson (Maths II) who\nhas been selected as a reserve for the Ladies Doubles.\nThe Championships will\nbe held at Crystal Palace Recreation Ground on 27-28\nNovember.\nOther results: \u2014 Men'sI beat Q.M. C.90, beat R.H. C.72. Men's II beat L.S.E.54. Men's III beat Q.M. C.54. beat F. Ham. 5-4.\nMen's Hockey\nU.L. Cup: Q.E. C.0 I.C.l st XI 4\nThis was the first cup\nmatch this season and I.C. are successfully through to\nthe next round. Most of the\nplay took place in the\nQ.E. C. goal mouth, but it\nwas not until just before\nhalf-time that Dave Richman\nput I.C. ahead. In the second\nhalf, Richman scored another two (by various devious\nmeans) and Ian Tasney\nmade it four shortly before\ntime.\nI.C.l st XI 2\nLondon Hospital 1\nI. C.1st XI 2\nChalfont St. Peter 0\nBoth these games were\nplayed with I.C. having only\n10 men. Dave Richman\n(wonder-boy!) kept up the\ngood work by scoring both\ngoals against London Hospital.\nRecord: P.8; W.7;D.0;L.1; Goals for 20; Against\n5.\nOn Sunday, 8th November\nI.C. fielded a strong team in\nthe annual U.L. six-a side\ntournament. Our first match\nwas against U.C. and proved to be our hardest, the winning goal coming in the final\nminute. Goldsmiths and\n'Royal Free Hospital were\nbeaten 3-0 and 2-0 re spec lively and with 6 points out\nof 6, I.C. headed their\ngroup.\nIn the quarter finals, a goal by Richman was sufficient to beat Bedford and\nagainst St. Thomas' Hospital in the semi-final, we\ndrew 1-1, losing however by\n2 short corners to 1. St.\nThomas' went on to overwhelm Guys in the final 5-0\nand win the tournament for\nthe fourth year running.\nIt was thus a great performance for I.C. who last\nyear failed to win a game.\nTeam from: A. Forbes, S. Tyrrell, M. Field, J. Sargent,\nM. Tatchell, D. Wilson, D. Richman.\nEDITORIAL As followers of sport at I.C. read this page they will\nhave realised that most of the major sporting events of the\nAutumn Term have either passed or are very close at hand.\nThe soccer, hockey and rugby have all played their l st rounds in their respective University cups\u2014the results of\nwhich are dotted about this page (and Felicity). Morphy\nDay has passed by for yet another college year as this largely\np reparative term draws to a close.\nHowever two important events need special mention. As\nexplained in more detail elsewhere on this page the B.U.S. F. badminton championships are near at hand and it is important to realise just what a good standard some people at\ncollege maintain in their own sport\u2014this is particularly true\nof badminton and also swimming. It is also true of middle\nand long distance running, some national champions having\nemerged from I.C. last year\u2014go along to the Hyde Park\nRelay organised by the Cross Country Clubs and realise the\nwealth of talent abounding at I.C.( Also, in this case, considerable organisational talent).\nIn conclusion, I must report the successful evening last\nweek when members of the sportsmen's club of I.C. gathered\nto listen and discuss their various sports in a convivial atmosphere. Wherever different types of people integrate and learn\n\u2014it must be good, even if it is called Sports Club.\n2nd XI\nThe second XI has had a satisfactory start to the sea-son. To date the record is:\nP4W L1D2 F9A6 The defence has been very\nsolid with one or two players\noutstanding, particularly Martin Jones and Simon Tyrrell.\nResults:\nI.C.2 nd XI7, Old Pals I1.I. C.2 nd XI 0, Chalfont St.\nPeter II 3.\nSlough IV 4 IC III 0\nFielding an inexperienced\nside I.C. had further trouble\nwhen their captain, John Andrews, went off with a hand\ninjury. The opposition were\nmore ait home on the all\nweather pitch but fine goal-keeping by Andy Paine bolstered 'the frail defence. By\nthe second half the I.C. players became accustomed to the\nsurface and they were unlucky not to score at least\nonce.\nLate Result. I.C.l st XI1, Southampton Univ. 0.\nI.C. put points on L.S.E. I.C.19 pts. L.S.E.6 pts.\nWith the first round of the\nGutteridge Cup Match only\na week away, both the team\nas a whole wanted to impress\u2014and also certain\nmembers fighting for their\ncup place. However, although the game started well,\nthe rugby standard deteriorated steadily. This was due\nsolely to the behaviour of\nthe referee whose strange decisions both baffled and irritated both sides.\nI.C. were 8-nil up after\nsome 10 minutes due to 2\ntries by wing forward Mike\nAdams both coming fi Vim good combined loose play\nby the forwards. Dennis\nBrownlee converted one.\nL.S.E. pulled back to 8-6\npts. after kicking two of the\nnumerous penalty chances\nthey were offered; this was\nthe score at a very wet and\nthoroughly uninspiring half\ntime.\nI.C. attempted to forget\nabout the ref in the 2nd half\nand play constructive rugby.\nThis paid off and continuous\npressure saw Nick Jeely go\nover from a five yard\nscrum. Brownlee converted.\nAfter good running by the\nbacks, winger Phil Lofts\nwent over for a try in his\nfirst game for the l st XV. L.S.E. \u2014with 2 men off due\nto bad ankle injuries\u2014really\ncracked badly and a crushing run by prop George\nWidelski saw full back Dick\nPudney go over.\nA reasonable performance\nby I.C. \u2014a particularly good\ndebut by fresher Alan James\nat fly half, in wet and slippery conditions.

Direction is by\nCosta-Gavras, photography by Raoul\nCoutard, and several familiar faces reappear in L'AVE U( THE CONFESSION). Yves Montand, in Z the left-wing deputy, whose assassination has\nthe connivance of army and police, in\nL'AVE U plays Artur London, the\nvictim of a Stalinist purge in Czechosolvakia.\nThe time is 1951, and Artur London is Deputy Foreign Minister. Black\nRussian limousines are parked nearby\nwhen he leaves his office, and follow\nhim home. Not long previously were\nthe trials of Rajk in Budapest and of\nKostov in Sofia, causing suspicion and\narrests in the communist satellites.\nLondon is fearful, but finds his bosses\ninaccessible. His car is chased and\nintercepted, and he is kidnapped by the\nsecret service.\nLondon's wife meets with bland re-assurances, about his helping with important secret business, but he is hidden away for months, frequently\nmoved about, denied access to party\nSuffering for the\nAfflicted\nMISERY MODULATIONS\nWhat is this new phenom en en, that, from Dolhs Hill to Parson's Green,\nis rivalling Concorde's boom problems as countless thousands stumble to switch\noff their radio sets? What is this hell on earth, that causes intense suffering to\nuntold millions of afflicted OAP's, housewives and motorists?\nHORROR\nThis incredible situation erupted over i two months ago when VHF set\nowners were horrified to find someone relaying BBC programmes, interlaced\nwith twice-hourly garbage strike reports. But worse was to come ! !\nWHAM!!* On 5th Oct. RADIO LONDON, your very own (and you can keep it \u2014 ed.)\nlocal misery-station, began producing its own programmes! But mercifully not\ntoo many, and some of them too early in the morning to switch on by mistake.\n* Believed to be a reference to young dynamic with-it Christopher Chaitterway (sic), super-minister of posts &c. officials, continually woken after being\ntold to sleep, and forced to keep walking the rest of the time, worn out\nmentally and physically. Soon he\nrealises that his arrest is no mistake,\nthat he is the victim of powerful forces.\nHe is subjected to violent \"inter rog a tion\" and gradually his resistance\nbreaks down and health deteriorates.\nLondon has worked in the Resistance in France, been imprisoned by\nthe Nazis, and fought for the International Brigade in Spain. A \"confession\"\nof alleged contacts and actions is\neventually concocted out of partial admissions quoted out of context and\nsupplemented with conjecture, and\nLondon is pressured into signing it. His\nwife loses her job, house and car, the\nchildren are moved to another school,\nand she is sent to work in a factory \u2014\nthe family has its bourgeois e privileges\nassociated with his former office re-moved.\nHe is tried, together with many\nothers, nearly all of Jewish extraction,\nvariously accused of Nazi-collusion and\nTrotskyism, in a trial whose script\nhas been rehearsed to perfection for\nlive national broadcast. When one de-fend ant's braces snap, plunging the\ncourt into hysterics, the microphones\nare switched off, lest justice be made\na mockery of! London is imprisoned, a further purge taking care of his pro-se cut or s, and is released in 1956, later\nwriting a book about his experiences.\nAnd in 1968 the story goes full-circle\nas Artur London watches the Russian\ntanks roll into Prague.\nCosta-Gavras has again demonstrated his mastery of the political thriller.\nThe skilful glossy melodrama of Z inescapably manipulates the viewer to\nindignation about the corruption in\nGreece which fao ilia ted the junta's takeover. The photography and editing\nof L'AVE U is certainly less glossy, but\nno less involving. Apart from the\nopening scenes and the newsreel footage in the epilogue, the action is mainly\nin the drab chilling interiors and cells\nof the seo ret service.\nAs a pro pog and a film it may not\nwork as well as Z, which builds up\nthe audience's satisfaction as they support the examining magistrate revealing the facts of corruption and com-pli city, and then, in the final few\nminutes, enrages them by the facts of\nthe subsequent army coup. The drama\nof L'AVE U centres around the subjugation of human spirit in the face of\nimpossible odds. The films share plots\n. involving implied external controlling\npowers \u2014 powers that cannot be\neradicated \u2014 the K.G.B. in Czechoslovakia, and the CIA. in Greece.\nAt 139 mins, an inconvenient length\nfor double-bills, it seems likely to receive more restricted release than Z, which is regrettable. L'AVE U is currently showing at the Curzon in a subtitled version \u2014 if you're going to see\nit, please do so before the dubbing\nhacks get at it !\nELVIRA MADIGAN has made a welcome return, and is now showing\nat Academy Two. Bo Widerberg's film\ntells of i the doomed love of an army\nofficer and the beautiful tightrope\nwalker \u2014 an exquisite and lyrical\npastoral romance set in turn-of-the-century Denmark.\nKES is still showing at Academy\nOne \u2014 evidently still doing well on\nthe rebound after distribution diff i cul ties, and well worth a look.\nCOLCUTT\n'What are they doing? '\nI looked around and saw the old man standing some\ndistance behind me on the sand.\n'They're trying to climb the cliff,' I yelled through the\nwhip of the gale that blew off the sea in erratic gusts, and\nwatched him come up to the rock I was leaning against.\n'Isn't it dangerous? ' he asked in the comparative shelter\nof the rock. 'The weather's pretty wild and it's a high cliff.'\nI shrugged and looked back to the kids clinging to the\ncliff face. 'Yes, but most of them don't realise it. A lot get\npermanently bruised and battered but there's a low fatality\nrate. You can see that a great number find a ledge low down\nand just cling to it till their time's up.' He was a little guy,\nwell muffled against the elements, and he had no right to be\non my beach. He smiled paternally.\n'Crazy college kids. I suppose you have to make the\nmost of it; you're only young once.'\n'Thank Christ for that', I said, but a gust of salt breeze\nblew my words away. The main body was clustered on the\nbottom half of the cliff and petered out toward the summit\nwhere you could see individuals striving to haul themselves\nhigher and higher.\nMy companion's eyes stopped scanning the scene and\nsettled on a point on the beach away to our left. His face\nlost its condescending glow and he turned to me sharply.\n'What about that, then? I thought you said they only\ngot bruised and battered.' I knew what he was looking at.\n'That was a long time ago', I replied vaguely. He was still\nquite agitated; 'but that shows how dangerous it all is, that's extremely serious.'\nI laughed. 'Of course it is, the poor dumb bastards aren't up there for fun you know.' Then thought about it; 'God\nknows, perhaps they are, at that. Still, as I said, the fatality\nrates low, and most of them aren't so dramatic as that.'\nHis face was paler above his spray-spattered scarf, and\nI felt sorry for him. 'Look,' I said, taking him by the arm\nand pointing, 'that's one of the funnier things about the\nwhole thing.' In a cluster near the centre of the cliff, just\nabove the main mass of people, there were twenty or thirty\nyoungsters lying on a ledge which was wider than most. They\nwere lying face down with their heads over the edge so that\nthey could call down to the throng clinging beneath them. I grinned at the old man, who looked puzzled.\n'They think they're on the top. They never look up, only\ndown. If you watch them long enough you'll see them encourage some of those beneath them to come up to their\nledge, then knock them down again when they get close.'\nHe looked horrified. No, they don't hurt anyone very badly,\nat least not intentionally.'\n'Do they stay there all the time? ' he asked. 'Most don't,I said. 'In general everyone goes to the top in time once\nthey get above a certain point, and almost all the ones on\nthat ledge move on up after they've stayed there some time.\nThat fuzzy-haired idiot with the beard's been there for years\nnow, but someone'll kick him up or off soon, I hope. He\nmeans well.'\nIt was getting colder as dusk moved in, and it was\nalready difficult to distinguish the horizon between sea and\nsky. I pulled my coat tighter and put up the collar to fend\noff the night wind which blew around us. You could see the\nmen on the cliff top now in black relief against a greying sky.\n'Those your friends? ' I asked him. He glanced up, his\nface expressionless. 'I used to know them,' he said.\n'That's where you should be, you know. There's no\nplace for the older generation on the beach; now you'll have\nto climb the cliff to get back up there.'\n'I just thought I'd come and see what it's like. It isn't so good is it? ', he said. I laughed again. You have to laugh,\nit's so crazy. 'They forget when they get to the top. The\neasier the climb the quicker they forget.'\nI had to yell the last sentence for he was already stumbling over the sand and pebbles to get to the foot of the cliff.\nIt was turning darker by the minute now, and soon I could\nbarely see him as he dwindled in the distance. I half-hoped\none of those above would kick down a boulder that would\nsquash him like a bug.\nWelcome back.\nWhere are you\ngoing for Christmas?\nJet London to Dublin 16\nto Paris \u00a35.25 to Basel \u00a39\n10 d nys ski in y in Switzerland from \u00a335\nGet FREE details today.\nAt these prices,\nyou can't afford not\nto go somewhere.\nISP1 BRITISH STUDENT TRAVEL CENTRE\n231 Tottenham Court Road, London W1 E4 ZZ Telephone: 01-637 1241\n\" Look Warden, they must have\nescaped through this hole.\"\n\n"

    "content": "Thursday, November 19th,1970 FELIX Page 5\nThe Chicago policemen are all out in cars, and it is an American boast that they can get\na car to any spot in less than two minutes. This may be all right for the firemen, but the\npolice here believe in prevention rather than finding the guilty party. It is not possible to\nobserve too much from a car and the man on the beat is indispensable.\nWe know that policemen usually patrol in pairs for personal safety but two policemen\nwalking hand-in-hand down Harrington M ews . . . .?\nRIFY ABDULLA and SHEKHAR\nMORE USK\nAfter last week's consideration of the background to U.S.K. and its social aspects, let\nme go on to toss around some ideas on social, academic and political matters.\nAs far as 'services' are concerned, this is where a lot can be done, some of it by bureau-crats. Accommodation by far the most pressing problem, needs tackling from all angles,\nand U.S.K. must do its bit. The West London Student Accommodation Bureau was launched last year as an attempt to provide a bureau which cuts across the binary system. It\nwas only partly successful due to a shortage of helpers, uncertainty over the future and\ngeneral difficulty in communication. A new effort is being made now, with the added\nimpetus of the troubles over the University of London all-student bureau (no space to\ngo into all that here.\nSave money ! ! ! . . . . Concessions; a well-loved and well-used service, which we haven't exploited at all here. One of the reasons is that this is an affluent area, and if one college\nin isolation goes to a retailer and asks for co n cessions the retailer says 'Why should I give\nyou a concession, when I can get the other 90 per cent of the students around here to\npay full price.' If U.S.K., representing all the students, organises this it ought to be a lot\neasier. Again, people must get on their tootsie s and trot around the shops (in an organised\nway of course).\nStudent travel. Wouldn't it be an obvious idea to have one U.S.K. travel bureau? At the moment there is much duplication of action. Maybe such a travel set-up could even\nnegotiate schemes of its own (coaches especially).\nThere are heaps of other things, like legal aw, a general student advisory service and so\non, which are all ideal fields for U.S.K. to work in, and as in all other potential areas of\nwork there should be a development of communication about, and inter-use of, existing\ncollege-based services (the nurseries for instance).\nOn to academic matters. Clearly this is inextricably linked with political considerations,\nwhen taken as meaning college authority co- operation. In many cases these political problems are irrelevant, but in these cases there is little real advance. I do not think that any\nlarge scale academic integration is possible within the present framework of educational\nstructure. The limited amount which is possible could include (as has already happened)\nusing lecturers from other colleges as 'guest lecturers', to facilitate diversification (not just\nat I.C., what about some scientists at R.C.A. for example?).\nPOLITICS\nIf one includes intellectual benefits as academic ones then there are naturally great\nadvantages to be gained just by talking and exchanging ideas with people of different academic backgrounds. This could be extended to political societies, union activity, dissemination of ideas and so on, and that brings me neatly to politics. .\nI have left the political potentialities of U.S.K. till last because I think that, ultimately,\nthey should be the most important. Exciting and far-reaching possibilities are presented.\nFirst, the very existence of U.S.K. is a political act in itself. At a time when the spectre of\na class-war, thought by many to be dead, is stirring (not least in the field of higher e duca tion) there must be no doubt of the significance of any strong student movement. By\nshowing that the U.S.K. can work in the more mundane and prosaic aspects of student\nactivity we are demonstrating surely, the contradiction behind the divisions of higher edu-cation. These divisions are based on the argument that it is necessary to have an elitist,\nhierarchical and authoritarian structure of higher education, and by demonstrating the\nviability of links in so many spheres we help to demonstrate the fallacy of this argument.\nIncidentally we also go some of the way towards demonstrating the fallacy of the similar\nargument applied to society as a whole.\nIn the practical sense the possible political act iv ties of U.S.K. are: communication, using\nU.S.K. as a channel for organising political a et ii vt it y, promoting and public is in gN.U.S. causes, and national and international causes, which we all agree about as a matter of\npolicy; N.U.S., organising joint action on N.U.S. motions and at conferences (although the\nquestion of college autonomy is important here and must be sorted out) in order to develop\nU.S.K. as an identifiable group within N.U.S.; Union organisations. Experience can be exchanged between the larger colleges, and help can be given to the smaller ones, with the\naim of improving the union organisation; College negotiations and confrontations. Important. Sharing of expertise, information, ex peri en ce, duplicating and printing facilities\nand a bit of sabbatical time, are all ways of helping each other, especially the larger colleges helping the smaller ones. Again, this is an example of an area doing what the\nN.U.S. is trying to do at the moment, but doing it at a more detailed, local and immediate\nlevel. In all these things N.U.S. centrally still has an immensely important place, in the\nnational arena, and in supplying more expertise and wider information, but the point is\nthat U.S.K. should channel this help.\nHELP NEEDED\nFor most of these activities two magic ingredients are needed\u2014money and involvement\n(i.e. people). At the moment an U.S.K. Fund administered by the U.S.K. Committee, receives from each college \u00a310 per thousand full-time students in that college (minimum\n\u00a310), which provides about \u00a3130. This may have to be increased a little, but surely the best\nway of financing projects is to request money from the colleges for specific tasks when re-qui red. There is also an N.U.S. Area Development Fund, but the terms of reference are\nrather restrictive, and unless there is a^ stunning reversal in N.U.S. finances the Fund will\nremain at its present insignificant level (\u00a3250) for a long time.\nHelpers are necessary for nearly all projects, and since student time is not as valuable a commodity as student money we must see labour-intensive projects as the most realistic.\nIf you want to help in any way go along to the union office, or get in touch with Dave\nKay at Q.E. C., or come along to an U.S.K. Committee meeting some time.\nSumming up, I hope I have shown that U.S.K. is an organisation with a potentially\nunique and valuable function, an organisation which is to the advantage of all students in it;\nthat nothing will be achieved without both enthusiasm of those at the moment responsible and equally the spreading of involve me nt wider and deeper; and lastly that the political implications of U.S.K., if seen clearly in all their subtleties, are ultimately the most\nimportant of all.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Thursday, November 19, 1970\nThe South Kensington I. The Fuzzzz\nTo start on an odd topic like this is probably a sign of madness. It is. We found ourselves in the Town Clerk's office on the Tuesday morning (having missed a practical of\ncourse) demanding a list of the Police stations in this area.\n\" WHAT?\"( astonished reply).\n\"Police stations, list thereof.\"\n\"Oh yes, certainly, don't get much demand for it these days.\"\nList of useful addresses:\nChelsea Police Station (recommended)\nLllCcLfl l^lc lCC London S.W.'7. Phone No. 589 1113.\nEarls Court Police Station (stay clear)\n72 Earls Court Road,\nLondon W.8. We got some pretty interesting facts from them. Members of Wog-soc will be glad to\nhear that there have been no race riots in this area. NOI am not encouraging members of\nany society to stay out late at night. I have probably read too many Godfrey Winn novels.\nApparently this is an affluent area, there are no 'ghettoes' (their words not mine) here so\nthere is no race trouble.\nInspector Lewis had a lot to say about race riots. We left wondering how much he\nreally felt about them and how much he was putting on. \"They are a great tragedy and I don't know what can be done about them. Pro b ably the next generation might find it easier\nto live in this land. As a police officer I simply cannot afford to be prejudiced. My wife's best\nfriend is . . . .\"\nUnfortunately Inspector Lewis didn't say much about demonstrations. He had had about\n13 students brought in one time. They were demonstrating against or for the Jordanian\nEmbassy, I don't remember the exact details. Apparently crowd hysteria in a demonstration is infectious (o.k. smart scientist, so you knew) so a mob of this sort tends to be rather\nreckless, though when questioned individually he tends to be docile and suffers not from a slight degree of trepidation. \"Criminals are brought in through the back door, not through\nthe front door; that's where the respectable public like Lord Muck enter from.\" Cells are\nnot comfortable places but they are functional. An odd thing is that some prisoners try to commit suicide but the police can't do much about this. Although the cells\nare bare and there are not many places to hang from, one could always find some way\nor other if one was desperate enough (like my mother always said the only good Britisher\nis a dead one).\nOne might say that the policeman's lot in this Borough was an easy one. After all,\npeople who buy \u00a35,000 houses at about five to six times the price just to live in this area\nare not going to run around stealing their neighbour's cats or indulge in a night's frivolous\nentertainment in the form of Paki-bashing, (not so very fashionable a sport these days).\nThis however does not mean that the Kensington cop's job is an easy one. I mean, he even\nhas to say 'Sir' to Lord Crumble-thorne.\nBeing otherwise largely a bed-sit area, the main troubles are people fighting with their\nlandlords, or beating up their neighbour's dog for barking too loudly at night. King's Road is a source of constant worry even where drugs are concerned.\nThe drug raid scene is not as most people believe it to be. Policemen do not sit around\na desk rubbing their palms gleefully and discussing whom to raid that night (except in\nScotland Yard). The better known pushers are dealt with by the Narcotic Squad at Scotland Yard (whose Press Bureau is un-helpful). Usually, a drug raid may not start off as such,\nfor instance a shop keeper telephoned one evening to complain about four people who\nhad locked themselves in his lavatory. On reaching there and kicking the door in the police\nfound the four members of an American pop group completely stoned out of their minds.\nAnother instance was that of the irate husband whose wife was in bed with another man\nand had locked him out (wise girl). Upon answering the follow's indignant phone call to\nthe police they found that the unfaithful couple had been smoking hash (better known as\nshit) all night. So one sees that drug raids are usually spontaneous and even then one may\nnot recognise them as such. Sometimes though the police do get specific calls indicating\nthat drugs are being (mis?) used at a certain place.\nInspector Haste, is at the Chelsea Police Station, and has studied history at Oxford. He\nwas very helpful and tried to answer most of the inane questions that we hurled at him\nHe offered to take us round on patrol duty and even his g uv nor agreed but the Public Relations Officer (from Scotland Yard of course) refused to give him the go ahead. We were\ntherefore subject to a polite refusal and apology and given a lift back in a police car. A police message from Scotland Yard at this time asked them to rush over to King's Cross\nStation where a man was selling five pound notes for two pounds ten . . .\nThe policeman's lot is a boring one with loads of routine patrols and masses of paper-work. Not only that, they are just about the only people who have to put in a half hour's 'voluntary' overtime every day with a piddling salary of about \u00a315 a week. They are not\neven paid for that 'voluntary overtime' and if they do not turn up for it they get a kick up\ntheir ass.\nThe poor policeman cannot demonstrate or do anything which would not be setting a good example to the public. But who will listen if they demand more wages? You? You would probably laugh in their faces; after all a policeman isn't expected to complain, is\nhe? I mean he's just part of the furniture isn't he? The poor guy is an under-paid and\noverworked scapegoat.\n\"It's the bloody policemen with their big boots and small brains.\"\nThey are supposed to be Solomons whose judgements are beyond question. Human\nfallibility is disregarded as the 'general public' views them with disfavour. The aristocracy\nlook upon them as social inferiors; the students' attitude tend to favour them as wet-blankets who ruin a wonderful hash-in or a demonstration; the coloured s regard them as\nbanner-wavers of racial is m and others think they only ruin an evening's drunken fun. As Inspector Lewis put it \"This is not a police state, we are not the judge, jury and the exe-cut i one r, we merely hand over criminals to the court. That's our job. After all this is a civilised society isn't it?\"\nWell folks, what do you think of Western Civilisation? I think it would be a good idea.\nThe only contact most I.C. students may have had with the police is to ask them the\nway (unless they were searched as. they wended their way homeward one evening in\nmerry fashion or got stopped for collecting without a licence\u2014this was probably a good\nthing), but the police can be a gold mine of useful(?) information. For instance, they can\ntell you how you may complain against a publican who has been particularly rude to\nyou, just before his permit comes up for renewal, and thus make it rather uncomfortable\nfor him; sometimes even resulting in the Brewery having to ask him to leave.\nAnother source of information they tell me, is the Public Relations Officer at Scotland\nYard (who is a civ vy). Our efforts\"to elicit information from him, though, resulted in total\nfailure. Several phone calls and a letter succeeded in bringing about no response at all.\nWell, that's the way red tape tangles; but to say 'damn Scotland Yard' at this point would\nbe petty vindictiveness on our part.\nHAS IC\nGOT A PROBLEM\nLIKE THIS?\nPOLICE IN ACTION\nSPEND NEXT SUMMER\nIN AMERICA\nALL EXPENSES PAID!\nCAMP AMERICA offers\nteachers and s liu dents over\n18, summer jobs as Camp\nCounsellors teaching American children sports,\nArts and Gratis, etc. Relturn\nflight, visa, full board and\nlodging, $75 pocket money\nand two week's free time\nfor it x a vel, all provided.\nApply now as vacancies are\nlimited.

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, 19th NOVEMBER, 1970 No. 295\nENTS EVENTS\nDONOVAN\nThe Great Hall was packed to near capacity a week last\nTuesday for the Donovan concert. Despite good advertising\naround the college, many Imperial College people did not\nknow this concert was on and so, as usual, there were more\npeople from outside the college than in. As a result, when\nDonovan asked the audience what was done here he got no\nreply but a small amount of laughter.\nDonovan appeared on his own for two one hour stretches,\nwith a short break between them. At first he seemed very\nindecisive about which songs to sing trying at first some\nquiet numbers and then a few louder numbers.\nAfter the interval, Donovan's attitude to the concert\nseemed to have changed completely. He seemed only to want\nto enjoy him solf( which 1 suppose is only fair). He started\nwith four really good songs, the first was about what he said\nis one of his favourite spots in the Isle of Skye.\nThis was followed by two songs on pollution, one being\non the effects it was having on the world and one concerning\nthe earth being a space ship hurtling through space slowly\nbeing polluted and no one knowing where it was going.\nAfter that a song on politicians all being the same, he\nseemed to lapse into songs which seemed to me quite mean-ingles s, the only memorable one was where he got all the\nboys in the audience to sing \"pom, pom, pom\" all the girls\nto sing \"happiness runs\" while he sang a backing.\n1 came away from this concert rather disillusioned with\nDonovan, somewhat put off by his insincerity throughout\nmost of the concert and by the speed at which he finished it.\nI love you, Nick.\nRCS\nStartling, incredible, hil-a riou s, depraved, edible,\nmagnificent stunning\u2014R.C.S. Smoking Concert was none\nof these things. On the other\nhand it was a considerable\nimprovement on last year's happening. After a speedy\n\"cast introduction\", the concert settled into the regular\nrun of sketches and lime re ricks. The organisers successfully dropped last year's competitive sketch scheme\n\u2014instead, dish y Denise held\neveryone's attention erect\nwhile Nick Wilkinson raffled\na plank.\nHoward Mathews, who\nmust own an unlimited return ticket to the Smoking\nConcert, once more tunnelled through his underground station sketch, to\ngeneral weeping from the\naudience.\nThe most original sketch\nof the night was the five\ntransvestite dancers spelling\nout obscenities, though it\nwould have been funnier if\nthey'd been spelt wrong.\nColin Fletcher, a living legend in the Union Bar,\nhelped by hirsute Nick Wilkinson and others, managed\nto produce plenty of smutty\nhumour to satisfy the\nmasses.\nThe scheme of giving a free pint with each ticket\nsoon had the concert hall\nswimming in beer. But decorum was maintained. Due\nto the fact that the audience\neventually made more noise\nthan the cast\u2014the final\nsketch was difficult to hear\nand unfortunately failed.\nSpecial thanks go to that\nversatile pianist and Dennis\nTaylor who threw flat beer\nover FELIX's photographer.\nNews in Brief\nEndsileigh Insurance (Brokers) Ltd is to set up an office\nin the College, to offer advice to students on all aspects of\ninsurance. A representative of Endsleigh, which is a totally\nowned subsidiary of N.U.S., will be in the College Block\nJ. C.R. from 12.30 to 14.30 every fortnight, starting next\nMonday, 23rd November.\n* * * *\nThe first round of the NUS \"Observer Mace\" will take\nplace in College Block at 6.30 p.m. on December l st. A team from IC will be battling against Thames Poly, University of East Anglia, and Gray's Inn, over the motion that\n\"This house considers the classless society to be an illusion\".\nThe judges are expected to include the President of UL U, the\nMaster of Birkbeck College, and an u named Tory M.P.***# So Broadsheet's threats to investigate that legendary mecca\nof satirical magazines, Neasden, were not founded on lies\nalone. Hidden members of the FBI( Felix Bureau of Investigations) spotted Andy Hinchcliffe's white van rolling northwards at 10.34 last Saturday morning. Signs decorating the\nvan clearly indicated the direction taken. In the next issue\nFELIX reviews the Twilight Zone, the Lost Continent, and\nthe planet Krypton.\nThe day nursery has now opened in temporary premises\non the first floor of 8, Princes Gardens, and it is hoped that\nconversion of the permanent quarters in the basement will\nbe completed in the second half of November. There are\nstill places available for a few children (up to 5 years old).\nEnquiries should be made to Miss Harris, at 8 Princes Gardens, and information may also be obtained from the Assistant Domestic Bursar (College Block), Dr. Anne Thorne\n(Physics), or G.A.C. Assimakis (Union Office).\n* * * *\nPoints from the recent Refectory Committee meeting included a rise for the barmen, the possibility of stopping\nbreakfasts in the Union (average attendance 17) and the news\nthat Southside new re fec is now open!!!\n* * * *\nStudents and workers of I.C.!! Take a weekend off from work! Don't waste your time in\nunproductive activities! Ease your social conscience! Do\nsomething practical for our Community. Come decorating\non Saturday and Sunday, 5th and 6th December. Absolutely\nno experience necessary. Lefties and/or mines men accepted.\nGo now to the O.S.S. notice board, outside the old lower\nMooney in Southside, and sign up.\nP.S. \u2014If you don't know what O.S.S. stands for, then it's time you did.\n* * * *\nAfter considerable discussion, ICU Council agreed at its\nlast meeting not to completely hand over the Snack Bar to\nBotany & Zoology. Instead, the room will be kept as a Union\nlounge, but during the day it will be available for the exclusive use of Zoology and Botany staff, students, and technicians, who hope to use the coffee equipment in the lounge\nto avoid the heinous 9d per cup in the lower Refec. In the\nevening, it will be book able for club activities, meetings,\netc. Conversion of the room should be completed for early\nnext session.\n* * * *\nAny applications for grants for proposed expeditions next\nsummer must be submitted to the Exploration Board on or\nbefore 2nd December for consideration by the Board's meeting on 9th Dec. Applications, with full details, to the Secretary of the Exploration Board, Civil Eng. Dept.\n* * * *\nDeputy President Special (2/8) K. wants to get in touch\nwith anyone who has ideas on how to brighten up the Union\nbuilding, preferably as cheaply as possible.\nIdeas floating round at present include re decoration of the\nUpper Refec, putting some of the lower lounge's \"waiting\nroom\" chairs in the Upper Refec and buying new, comfortable lounge furniture for downstairs, improving the decor in\nthe lower lounge, installing a Juke Box, coffee machine, etc.,\npersuading members of ICWA to re-open the extension bar,\nand so on.

HOLL IN S Maths 2\nEditorial\nJohnathon Moont originally conceived the idea of increasing\nHouse/Hall rents. Reason for doing so are obvious \u2014 the\ngreater income means cash for the building of more student\naccommodation.\nRelatively speaking the most economical scheme is to\nbuild a new hall of residence directly North of Linstead\u2014in\nfact a detailed estimate has already been made. The UGC has\nstopped providing money for building new student residences,\nbut it will provide finance for the furnishing of such residences.\nNote that at the time of completion, it cost \u00a3200 per room to\nfurnish S/ S and \u00a3150 per room for Linstead. A rent increase\nof ten shillings per week would mean that Northside, able\nto accommodate about 200 students, could be built five years\nfrom now.\nOf course, money will come from other sources, it would\nbe unfair if the finance came from students alone. The College\nalso makes gentle probes into industrial concerns with accommodation plans in mind. At present hall rents do make a slight\nprofit and the halls have now accumulated quite a substantial\n\"float\". The \"Linstead hotel\" scheme, perhaps expanded to\nother halls, promises to be a valuable money spinner in the\nfuture, and subletting of Student Houses last Summer brought\nin \u00a35000 clear. Another suggestion has been to absorb at\nleast part of the rent increases by lowering the cleaning standards in hall. I'm sure many students would prefer to do a few chores themselves rather than pay an extra five to ten\nshillings per week.\nThe point which needs making is that if students help\nto finance halls, then they deserve to play a greater part in\nrunning them. It's a point which still needs discussion\u2014John\nSommers (Halls rep) lives in 617 Tiz. and welcomes all ideas\nand suggestions.\nBlindsight\nDear Sir,\nUnder the heading \"Blind-sight\" in the last issue, the\nwriter makes false statements\nabout Moral Re-Armament,\nwhich are totally unsubstantiated. He states that it is\n'rolling in money\". We being\nintimately involved in the\nwork of MR A and having\nstudied its published accounts\nfor the financial year 1968-1969 know this is not true.\nPerhaps the title of the article is meant to refer to your\ncolumnist.\nWe submit, therefore, that\nif his reporting of financial\nfacts is unreliable, readers\nshould attach limited value\nto his review of a stage pro-duct ion. As the article is unsigned\nit presumably reflects editorial opinion, so we request\nthe editors to withdraw the\nstatement.\nMay we also suggest that\nreaders see the play for themselves and form their own\njudgement.\nYours faithfully,\nK.E.

This refreshingly 'un-spec iai lise d' article on\ncareers by Mr.E. Meacock,\nwas first published in FELL X last year. Remember no-one\ncan choose your career fop\nyou, they can only give you\nideas.\nIn one's early days, from\nabout five years to seven\nyears old, the favourite,\nquestion \u2014 \"and what do\nyou want to be when you\ngrow up?\" could be, and\nwas usually, answered emphatically \"Jet Pilot\",\n\"Spaceman\", and even \"En-g in e driver\" according to\nthe vogue at that particular\ntime. As one grew older\nthese childhood ambitions\ndimmed until, in the majority\nof cases, the mind became\nperplexed by the increasing\nknowledge of the world and\nthe activities of other men\nand women.\nThe state ol vagueness\ncan, and does last until the\nsecond, and even third year\nat a university. This fact is\nrecognised and Appointments Boards exist, not\nmerely to act as employment bureaux, but to advise,\nguide, and to help those\nstudents who wish to take\nadvantage of the facilities\navailable.\nAt Imperial College there\nis a member of the academic\nstaff in each department who\nis a member of the Sub Committee of the Appointments\nBoard. Any student first,\nsecond or third year, or post-graduate, can consult their\nCareers\ntalks\nCareer opportunities talks\nare held at 1.30 every Tuesday and Thursday in the\nAutumn term. They take\nplace in Lecture Theatre A, level 5, College Block (not\nLecture Theatre B as stated\nin the relevant IC pamphlet).\nFurther information on the\nsubjects discussed and IC\nAppointments Board is available from this pamphlet, in\nturn available from Departmental Representatives and\nMr. Meacock. Mr. Meacock\nis in Room 307, College\nBlock (int. 2740) and is airways willing to discuss\ncareers and suggest inter-views. As an example the\nsubject of today's lecture is\n\"Careers in computing\", and\nTuesday's is \"Graduate opportunities in technical sales\nand marketing.\"\nmaking a choice\ndepartmental representative\nwho will give as much\nadvice and assistance as\npossible, but before consulting him the students may\nwish to explore for themselves some of the fields\nwhich his or her studies are\nopening up for them.\nThere are several publications which can be of great\nhelp to a student who requires career information.\nAmong these, and perhaps\none of the best, is the\n\"Directory of Opportunities\nfor Graduates\" which is\npublished by Cornmarket\nCareers Centre Ltd. This\nbook gives information\nabout a large number of\nfirms and organisations who\nhave an interest in recruiting graduates, and reference\nto this book will answer a lot of those questions about\nthe firms which the student\nwill ask. Another publication on similar lines is the\nClassic Publications Ltd.\n\"Professional Careers for\nGraduate Scientists and\nEngineers.\"\nThese books are excellent\nin giving students ideas and\ninformation concerning com-pani es, but they still do not\nsupply the whole answer to\nyour question \"What do I want to do?\"\nMost of the firms who\nemploy graduates issue\nliterature describing their\norganisations, and the\nvarious opportunities open\nto the graduates who join\nthe company. Naturally this\nis recruitment literature and\nbiased in the firms favour\u2014\none would expect this, but\nthe literature provides part\nof the information necessary\nto help decide on the final\nline of action.\nOccasionally the course\nsuggested above does not\ngive the student the answer\nand after going through the\nbooks and brochures, and\ntaking his problems to the\ndepartmental representative\nthat perplexity still remains\nto some extent. There is yet\na further source of advice\nopen at the College.\nThe Imperial College\nAppointments Board has\nstrong links with the University of London Appointments Board and we have\ntaken advantage of a comprehensive Careers Advisory\nService which the University Board provides. The\nService is operated by Field\nOfficers who are graduates\nwith a wide range of experience and a thorough\nknowledge of most fields of\nemployment. A Field Officer\nvisits the College one day a week during term and vacations to help students make\ndecisions about careers and\nsubsequently to help put\nthem in touch with suitable\nbm ploy ers. Students who\nwish to see the Field Officer\nshould consult their departmental representative first.\nI have glibly talked of\nthe books and brochures but\nhave given no hint of how\nto gain access to them. That\nomission shall now be rec-tif i ed. The College Appointments\nBoard have opened a publications Library on Level 3,\nCollege Block, where all the\nliterature supplied by the\ncompanies or connected with\ncareers is available.\nSo far I have dealt with\nthe student who, having\ncompleted his course, selects\na career within his field of\nstudy, but what of the\nstudent who wishes to use\nhis degree in wider fields?\nA good guide here is a publication issued by the\nCareers Research and\nAdvisory Centre entitled\n\"Beyond a Degree\" which\ngives considerable help in\nsuggesting possibilities which\nprobably would not occur\nto the student in this pos i tion.\nTo such students my\nadvice is to consult the\nabove mentioned book,\nwhich is available on application to the\" AppointmC: '\u2022\nBoard Office on Level 3,\nCollege Block then discus;\npossible plans with your\ndepartmental representative\nand, if he advises, the Field\nOfficer.\nAs there may be some\ndoubt in students minds as\nto the identity of their departmental representatives a full list is given below:\nAeronautics \u2014 F.C.

Careers again\nElectric Folk\nAs part of their \"Come\nTogether\" series of events,\nthe Royal Court Theatre,\nSloane Square, presented on\nSunday, 25th, a concert featuring Steeleye Span and\nFotheringay. Both of these\ngroups are splinter groups\nfrom the Fairport Convention, and have kept basically\nto that group's original con-c ep t,i.e. to carry on the tradition of English folk music\nusing electric instruments.\nSteeleye Span, formed by\nex-Fairport man ly ger Hutchings and including\nwell-known folk-singer Martin Carthy, played first, with\ngirl vocalist Maddy Prior and\na backing of amplified violin\nand guitars. Their act seemed\nto me to be too loose and\nunc ordinated for a professional group, but included\none interesting item in the\nform of an unaccompanied\nversion of an obscure Bob\nDylan song 'Lay down your\nWeary Tune.'\nAfter the customary road-managers' interval, Fotheringay appeared, and immediately snowed themselves to\nbe a far more self-assured\nband, held together by the\nlively personalities of Trevor\nLucas and the amazing\nSandy Denny. Their material\nvaried from a solo una c com jani ed \"Lowlands of Holland\" from Sandy to a couple\nof Australian bush-ranger\nballads sung by Trevor.\nNotable also was Jerry Donahue's rubber-fingered electric guitar work.\nBoth groups were handicapped to some extent by the\nproblems of setting up aP.A. system on a small stage without suffering from \"feed-back\", particularly when the\naudience is on both sides\nof the stage. The concert was\ncertainly good value by\nmodern standards at 5/- for\na promenade ticket. 'Promen-ade' at the Royal Court\nmeans sitting on the floor\nwithin yards of the stage.\nCharlie Hulme.\nYOUR OWN APPOINTMENTS SERVICE\nby B.J. PRIGMORE,\nChairman, Imperial College Appointments Sub-Committee\nYou want advice, information and introductions to help\nyou to launch yourself on a suitable professional career: we,\nwho form the College Appointments Service, offer it to you.\nImperial College is unusual in that its first line advisory\nservice is offered by members of the academic staff of the\nvarious departments, chartered engineers and professional\nscientists in their own right, who have been entitled Departmental Appointments Representatives. Since they know you,\nand are themselves involved, often at the highest levels, in\nthe Professional Institutions associated with your hoped-for\nDegree, they are in an excellent position to advise you about\nthe employment, and training for membership of your Institution, which might best suit you personally.\nINFORMATION\nAssociated with this advice is information: brochures\nfrom appropriate employers are held in each Department,\nand your Appointments Representative may direct your attention to information of which you had hitherto been un-aware.\nBroader information is held in the Careers Library (Room\n303, College Block).\nYou should anyhow skim the Directory of Appointments for Graduates and other relevant literature to give\nyourself some background knowledge.\nMaybe you feel yourself called to a career not closely\nassociated with your degree subject? If so, apply via your\nAppointments Representative to see Mr. P. Ashworth or his\ncolleague, Mr. A. Wheatcroft, of the University of London\nCareers Advisory Service. They come to Imperial College\nevery Wednesday, and have all the resources of ULCAS\nbehind them. Following their broad advice, aimed at guiding\nyou to make the best use of your characteristics, they can introduce you to a phenomenal range of potential employers.\nDon't hesitate to ask to see our UL CAS friends if you\nfeel they could help. First and second year, as well as final\nyear students, are especially invited to accept this offer on a 'friendly chat' basis.\nOLD CENTRALIANS\nAre you in Guilds? The Old Centralians' Counseling\nScheme is specially for you. Don't forget the Old Centralians'\nReception on Monday, 23rd November: useful introductions\ncan emerge from it.\nAfter receiving advice and information, you will want\nintroductions: If an employer is coming to College in the\nspring term, it saves time for all concerned that you should\nthen attend for a preliminary interview. To this end, use the\ncentral organising service provided by Mr. A.G.E. Meacock. Send him (via your Appointments Representative in\nsome Departments) your interview application forms early\nin December. You will then receive appropriate brochures\nand application forms well before the interviews. Don't forget to have read the brochures carefully before the inter-views: it saves time on preliminaries and gives a good im-press ion. If you are a post-graduate student you also have the\nfull service offered to you: ask for a set of careers papers\nfrom your Representative.\nSo don't forget: if you want careers advice or in form a tion, you have only to knock on the door of your Appointments Representative's office: we are at your service.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF\nIMPERIAL UNION COLLEGE\nEditor: Anthony John Sims\nAssistant Editor: Mike Yates\nAll the other Assistant Editors:\nColin Harvey, Dave Sugden,\nTyping: (See Assistant Editors)\nPhotos: Malcolm Bailey, Steve Heap, Pete Johnson,\nKevin Beat, Dave Mansfield.\nCirculation: Pete Morgans, Arnold Darby\nSports: Mike Adams\nBusiness: Ian Quarrinton\nAnd grateful thanks to: Susan Parry, Tom Jaffray,\nTony Kirkham, Roger Lindsay, John Ackers, Kitty\nMcVey, Piers Corbyn, Judith Walker, Colcutt, John\nGoodman, Mark Lane, Charlie Hulme, Rify Abdulla,\nShekhar, Dianne.\nPrinted by F.

So sym pathis in gI sat down, long after the corridors of\nCollege Block had been dimmed out and wrote a solemn history of General Studies from\nits enthusiastic inception in 1952 by Sir Roderic Hill to its present state of institutional is ed respectability with declining audiences. In the morning, my secretary, who had burnt no\nmidnight oil, said; scrap it; all that guff about opening minds, sounds like an enema. Don't write history, write about now. Write about what it is like to be you with 132 gaps per year\nto fill.\nCULTURAL REVOLUTION\nGaps to be filled with\nstimulating, entertaining and\nenlightening titbits, to entice\nweary students to give up\ntheir free time. For that is\nwhat General Studies is. We\ncannot offer you higher\ncourse marks or anything\ndirectly relevant to your\nstudies. But we do try to provide a worthwhile foundation / background / starter to\nas wide a variety of subjects\nas possible. Subjects which\nrange almost as widely as\nthere are descriptive cate-go ries: philosophy, sex, re lig ion, theatre, politics, history,\narcheology, banking, poverty,\nfilms, poetry, economics,\nart, jazz, mortgages, music\n\u2014you name it\u2014no, seriously,\nthat is all you have to do\u2014\ntell us what you would like\nto have a talk on and we will\ntry and find the best speaker\navailable. This is not always\neasy nor are the results always successful; the most\ndistinguished 'name' may be\na disastrous lecturer; the\nthe most intriguing title announce a dead bore.\nIn the past, series of lectures on themes such as philo-soph y, Marxism; a specific\narea of art, or poetry, or\nmusic have drawn consistent\naudiences. This points to the\ngenuine desire of students to\ngo beyond the superficial and\n(where we hope in future,\nthe Associated Studies disciplines will take over. But\nif we can, through a chance\ndropping in on a lecture, or\nrecital, stimulate a new interest or keep alive one that,\nthrough the pressure of other\nwork, might be dropped, we\nU.S.A Are you interested in\nNorth America ?\njoin UNIVERSITY\nSTUDENTS ABROAD\nInternational House,\n40 Shaftesbury Avenue,\nLondon, W. l.

For music\nlovers there is a concert\nevery Thursday in 53 Prince's Gate in the Mathematics\nLibrary.\nAll this adds up to a pretty\nalive and buzzing programme\nto suit very varied interests.\nYet one has only to talk to\npeople to realise how many\nstudents do not really know\nwhat is going on or even what\nGeneral Studies are. But\nthis term every Freshman had\na green folder with details of\nboth General and Associated\nStudies lectures in their\nFreshers envelopes; every\nstudent, as he registered, was\ngiven one; every week we\nscatter the departments with\na rash of posters.

It has been suggested\nto us that reports of General\nStudies might be printed in\nFELIX for the benefit of\nthose who could not go and\nalso as a record.\nNow at last! The cultural\nrevolution is born! I.C. is in\nits second year of a 'lefty'\npresident and as the year\ndrags along more and more\nof us are despairing at voting a lefty back for a second\nyear.\nImperial College flourishes\nunder a cultural union\u2014the\nadministration is pleased\nand consequently helpful,\n'nd us try is pleased and\ngives us money to build new\nlaboratories, Halls of Residence, etc. (Piers' derogatory\ncomments at the time of the\nQueen's visit is reputed to\nhave resulted in \u00a3100,000 being withdrawn from the College and many letters of\ncomplaint from old members\nof the College). We live and\nthrive in a cultural union.\nNUS\nI.C. Council in the past\nfew years has been dominated by a lefty clique. These\npeople gave away your\nmoney to NUS to back\nlarge expensive and largely\nfutile campaigns. In days\ngone by the President spent\nyour money on you by providing entertainment and by\ndistributing larger sums of\nmoney to the constituent\ncolleges, I CW A and the\nAthletics Clubs. These are\nthe institutions in which we\nought to invest all our\nmoney together with RC C and SCC and not with the\nNUS.\nUSK When the University of\nSouth Kensington was\noriginally invented we all\nthought what a superb idea\na chance to do diversified\nsubjects instead of nasty\nmathematics, mining or\nwhatever. But do we really\nneed it? NO! I.C. is internationally known as one of\nthe foremost colleges of\nScience and Technology.\nThe formation of USK would kill this reputation\nand create just another university that no one has\nheard of. The other colleges don't really need us\nand far more to the point we\ndon't need them.\nLeft-wingers find it all too\neasy to sit on their backsides in smokey rooms\ncriticising Barclays, apartheid arms sales to South\nAfrica. Fair enough but\nthese are not things for I.C. Union to decide. We have\n(or rather had) a healthy debating society to debate\nissues such as these, and our\npolitical societies exist for\nthose who wish to demonstrate and contribute help to\nthese causes. Do we pay our\nPresident to take her lefty\nclique away to Margate to\nplay games with hundreds of\nother lefties at their useless,\nexpensive conferences or do\nwe pay her (and our secretary) to work for the Union.\nThe president feels that the\nmembers of her own union\nare incapable of making up\ntheir own minds about OTC etc. and bars them from our\nfresher s fair \u2014 criticise her\nyes and learn from her mis-takes. Gain in knowledge\nand the revolution must win\nbut remember we will never\nbar lefty Soc from our\nfresher s fair just because it\nencourages para-nuisance on\nour campus plain.\nThe first quarter of the\nyear has seen the President\ndevote almost all her\nenergy to political fields and\nvirtually none to any I.C.U. business which is what she\nis paid for.\nNow is the time for you\nto support the revolution\nand soon will be the day\nthat the revolution conquers.\nSTEVE COOKF.\nLIVE THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION Record Review\nSo we wanted to review records. But first we had to get\nrecords. So we don't recommend Philips for anything \u2014\n' NO!' they said \u2014 ' GOODBYE!' they said ('shit' said we).\nTransatlantic however are helpful and so next issue we will\nbe reviewing both the new Pentangle and John Renbourne\nalbums. President tried to give us a lot of records but they\nonly have crap like reggae and soul and yuk! But they are\npushing a new group called 'Ghost'. This is a very versatile\ngroup with a fairly original sound; they have two vocalists,\none very like Sandy Denny and one I could have sworn was\nRoger Chapman of Family \u2014 but isn't. The album 'When\nyou're dead' on Gemini is well worth listening to although 1\nwould recommend a good listen before buying it.\nMany moons ago President took over VJ records and\nhave at last got round to re-releasing old rock 'n' roll and\nsome good old soul (honest \u2014 it is good). Already out are\nSandy Nelson, Betty Everett and John Lee Hooker and a various artist Album ('Rock V Roll Stars' JS5006) with\nRitchie Valens (La Bamba) Terry Stafford (Suspicion)\nBobby Day (Rockin' Robin) (etc., etc.) which is GOOD.\nThis CBS brought out a new Johnny Winter album and an\nalbum by Skid Row which is BAD. They seem to take a good riff and play it backwards just to make it sound wrong,\nand on a couple of tracks they are definitely off tune. SO IF\nYOU LIKE SYNCOPATION \u2014 GET IT! (otherwise forget\nit, it really is abysmal).\nAlso out this month is another Al Kooper album 'Easy\ndoes it' which keeps up the Kooper tradition of spoiling\nsome really good songs with nasty overpowering brass \u2014\nalthough as the originator of Rock brass with Blood Sweat\nand Tears I suppose he has to put some in. Tim tells me\nsome of the lyrics are superb and although one track is sadly\nmarred by out of context backing voices (shades of Delaney\nand Bonnie) most of it appears to be first class material.\nCBS have also released one of the most magnificent\nrural blues albums I have heard \u2014 Robert Johnson, King of\nthe Delta blues singers (CBS64102) this is a blues addicts\ndream, but if you only like Rock blues forget it! This album\nis the sort of foundation on which a whole sector of modern\nblues, such as a lot of Cream and Stones material, has been\nbuilt; it is the second of two volumes containing all of Robert\nJohnson's recorded material.\nFinally, about the best of this month's new releases. On\nBlue Horizon (S763859) \u2014 KEY LARGO. A group of\nvery very together musicians playing music which, even if at\nfirst unexciting, is quite faultless in its presentation. The\nstyle is Blues. But this is blues incorporating the full range\nby Chris Schofield\nof blues styles from Otis Spann to earlier Canned Heat and\nBlood Sweat and Tears; almost as if this is the product of\ntaking all post-war blues, throwing out the bad and the\npseudo, mixing up the rest with a fair sprinkling of Afro and\noriginality.\nIt's very difficult to review a sound you like and say\nyou like without sounding pseudo or stupid or both (particularly for me, I'm told) so I 'll just say Key Largo is varied,\ninteresting, and GOOD \u2014 I like it.\nPeople who know my taste in music have asked 'Just because you recommend a record, how do we know we will\nlike it? ' Fair enough criticism I guess. So, if you want to\nlisten to any of the music we talk about then come to 577\nSelkirk and listen to it, or go to any Disco around college\nand find either Tim or Chris and if the mood is right, we'll\nplay it.\nMore about records next issue.\nTIM AND CHRIS\nP.S. Been out a week or so \u2014 a single by Jimi Hendrix\nwith Voodoo Chile; Hey Joe; and Watchtower (Mastertracks\n2095 001). 15 minutes of Hendrix for 6/- \u2014 A GOOD\nTHING.\n\n"
