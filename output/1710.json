I remember\nit perfectly, as it was the\nday I had my first exam\nas an Imperial undergrad-uate. The night before\nI had been listening to\nBlackstar, the surprise\navant-garde album that\nhe had released only two\ndays earlier, and I was still\nmesmerised by its dark\ntones and the raspiness\nof his aged voice. Tired,\nstressed, and a little bit\ndepressed by the sheer\nbleakness of the record,\nI went to bed, hoping for\na good sleep to ensure a\nclear head the following\nday. I awoke to a news\nalert on my phone, followed by a sudden kick\nin the stomach as my half-asleep brain processed the\ninformation displayed on\nthe screen. My idol was\ndead.\nBut he was not the only\nperson that passed away\nthat day. Throughout\nhis life, he had as many\navatars as a Greek god,\nand indeed sometimes it\nseemed that he had been\nsent from an otherworldly\nrealm by a mysterious\nhigher power to marvel us.\nHe was a young beatnik\nfrom South London that\nlooked for abandoned\nAfghan fur coats in the\ndumpsters of Carnaby\nStreet. An androgynous\nalien that performed fake\nfellatios on his onstage\nbandmates. A European\naristocrat with fascist\ninclinations triggered by\na diet of milk, peppers,\nand massive amounts of\ncocaine. He was all those\ncharacters, and many\nmore, as every single fan\nhad a different element\nof his persona attached to\nthem.\nTo pay him homage in\nthe best way I can think\nof, I have selected a list\nof his most underrated\ncompositions, in chronological order. Listen to\nthem, and you will be able\nunderstand why the innumerable masks he put on\nwere just that, masks. And\nbehind them remained\na hidden, even more sophisticated personality, an\nexpert on dozens of fields,\nranging from Kabbalistic\noccultism to American\npolitics. A deep knowledge that allowed him\nto become the man who\nshocked the world.\n\u2018Cygnet Committee\u2019\n(1969)\nHidden in Space\nOddity, the record that\nbrought him to fame with\nits unforgettable title\ntrack,\u2018CygnetCommittee\u2019\nnarrates with melancholic\ntone the disappointment\nthat follows the success\nof most revolutions, in\nno doubt inspired by his\nrecent experiences with\nthe hippy-run Beckenham Arts Lab. At over\nnine minutes, it remains\nBowie\u2019s third longest song\nin his entire discography.\n\u2018Quicksand\u2019(1971)\nThe guitars provide\nlightness to this ballad\nthat shows off Bowie\u00b4s\nprofound understanding\nof the esoteric. With\nreferences to occultist\nAleister Crowley and\nNietzschean philosophy,\nthe song explores themes\nthat would be further\ndeveloped in his future\nalbum Station to Station.\nIt is not surprising that\nthis is Marilyn Manson\u2019s\nfavourite song of all time.\n\u2018Five Years\u2019(1972)\nWhat to say of this\ngreat opener? A perfect\nintroduction to the glam\nrock era symbolised by\nhis alter ego, the flamboyant Ziggy Stardust, \u2018Five\nYears\u2019 tells the story of\na man that finds out that\nthe world will end in the\neponymous time, leading\nhim to ponder about his\nlife. Overshadowed by\nsome of the best and most\nfamous songs of his career\n(\u2018Starman\u2019, \u2018Suffragette\nCity\u2019, \u2018Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\nSuicide,\u2019 and \u2018Moonage\nDaydream\u2019, to name a\nfew), its final guitar solo\nby Mick Ronson foreshadowed the wonders\nthat of the album that\nwould soon follow.\n\u2018Lady Grinning Soul\u2019\n(1973)\nOne of Bowie\u2019s many\ntalents was his ability to\nfind collaborators who\ncould enhance and elevate\nhis songs to a superior\nlevel. That is the case\nof virtuoso pianist Mike\nGarson, who started a\ndecades long association\nwith Bowie in this album.\nThe masterful piano\nentrance combines perfectly with Bowie\u2019s silky\nvoice in this love ballad.\nIt has been called \u201cthe\nBond theme that Bowie\nnever did\u201d, as its lyrics\nand melody fit nicely with\nthe atmosphere of Roger\nMoore\u2019s 007 era.\n\u2018Word on a Wing\u2019\n(1976)\nStation to Station is a\nmonument to insanity.\nThe culmination of his\nThin White Duke period,\nhe admitted decades after\nits release that he had no\nrecollection whatsoever of\nthe recording and production process, his cocaine\naddiction becoming so\nconsuming that he regularly stored his urine in the\nfridge, for fear of witches\nstealing it. The occultist\ntones of the title track\nare further explored in\n\u2018Word on a Wing\u2019, a song\nmarked with references\nto religion and crises of\nfaith that arose every time\nBowie awakened from his\ndrug induced delirium.\nThe angelical chorus that\ncloses the composition\nprovides a strong contrast\nto the actual state of mind\nof the performer.\n\u2018Subterraneans\u2019\n(1977)\nMove one year into\nthe future, and you would\nfind an entirely different\nBowie. Transplanted from\nLA to Berlin to end his\naddiction once for all,\nthe mostly instrumental\nsongs of Low capture the\nadmission of defeat of\na man that had hit rock\nbottom, and musically\nserve as precursors to the\nsynth and funk of the 80s.\nThe closing track of the\nrecord, \u2018Subterraneans\u2019\ngloomy melodies in stark\ncontrast to its delicate\nsax solos that evoke past,\nhappier times. It is supposedly dedicated to the\npeople living East of the\nBerlin Wall, whose suffering was only increased\nby the festive memories\nof belle-epoque Weimar\nGermany.\n\u2018The Secret Life of\nArabia\u2019(1977)\nAnother great ending\ntrack, this song combines\nBowie\u2019s famous falsetto\nwith the African rhythms\nthat would be further\nexplored in his next\nalbum, Lodger. It has\nbeen unfairly panned as\nout of tone with the rest of\nthe album, but it provides\na great transition to the\nstyles that Bowie would\nfully fledge on later years.\n\u2018Waterloo Sunset\u2019\n(2003)\nA cover may be a\nstrange choice for this list,\nbut Bowie\u2019s version of\nthe classic Kinks anthem\nmanages to surpass the\noriginal. Its rockier tone\nshowed that the swinging\nLondon of the 60s had\nbecome a truly global city\nby the late 90s, serving as\nan update the most iconic\nsong ever written about\nLondinium.\n\u2018Valentine\u2019s Day\u2019\n(2013)\nAfter the superstardom\nof the 80s and relative\nobscurity of the 90s and\n00s, Bowie returned to the\nspotlight with a surprise\nalbum that meditated on\nboth his life achievements\nand memories, and his\nlatest obsessions. Valentine\u2019s Day is the latter,\nnarrating the story of a\nteenaged mass shooter in\nsuburban America.\n\u2018I Can\u2019t Give\nEverything Away\u2019\n(2016)\nHow to define Blackstar? A magnus opus that\nbecame even more definitive when Bowie passed\naway two days after its\nrelease. This song is the\nlast album track of his\ncentury spanning career.\nIts message of calm\ndespair before the unavoidable end will always\nresonate with anyone with\nhalf a heart. Truly the\nmost emotional swansong\never recorded.\nGorrochategui\nPolitics Editor\nChameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature //\nWikimedia\n\n"

On a molecular\nlevel, cooking is simply\nchemistry. The Imperial\nCollege London Department of Chemistry\nagrees, and will be\nadvancing this notion\nby introducing a new\nmodule: \u201cIntroduction\nof Culinary Practices\u201d\nfor first year undergraduates who enter in\nautumn 2019.\nThe Chemical Kitchen,\nF\nirst year medical\nstudent, Hamzah\nSelim, has delivered his first\nbaby - at a tube station.\nHamzah, who graduated from Imperial\nHeroic Hamzah helps deliver baby at tube station\nin 2018 with a BSc in\nBiomedical Science and\nnow studies at University\nCollege London, was on\nhis way home following\nan anatomy lecture on the\nafternoon of Tuesday 15th\nJanuary when he heard\ntwo women shouting for\nhelp.\nHe saw the mother\nleaning against a wall\non the Northern line\nplatform. \u201cI went over\nto help because it looked\nlike she was about to\nfaint\u201d, told Hamzah of\nthe experience. When he\nreached her, he realised\nthe mother was in labour\nand the \u201cbaby was 50%\nout already\u201d. Hamzah\nthen sat the woman down\nand delivered the baby\nboy.\nHamzah said his training from the time he spent\nworking on a maternity\nward kicked in: \u201cit was\njust instinct\u201d.\nThe mother had been\nshe was going into labour\nshortly before 2pm. She\nalso told Hamzah she had\ngiven birth to three other\nchildren.\nParamedics arrived\nminutes after the boy was\nborn and cut the umbilical cord. The child and\nmother were then later\ntaken to hospital by the\nmedics.\nas the module is also\ncalled, aims to introduce\nstudents to laboratory\nskills and practical experience via a more approachable and unconventional\nmethod. Lesson plans will\ncover traditional cooking\ntechniques as well as\nmethods such as \u201cspherification\u201d (think tapioca\npearls in bubble tea).\nThis trial module is\npart of a \u201cTechniques\nBootcamp\u201d that first year\nchemists will attend in\ngroups of eight, brought\nabout by the ongoing\ncurriculum review of all\nImperial College undergraduate teaching.\nThe sessions will train\nstudents how to document\npractical work, observation skills and dexterity,\nachieving consistent\nresults, and executing\nwritten directions. The\nDepartment hopes that\nstudents will become\naccustomed to complex,\npractical tasks, and will\ndevelop ordered and\nsystematic approaches to\nthem.\nThe Department of\nChemistry is developing\nthis unconventional\nmodule in collaboration\nwith Jozef Youssef from\nthe Basque Culinary\nCentre. Youssef is the\nfounder of Kitchen\nTheory, a gastronomy\nexperience design lab, and\nhas had years of experience at Michelin star restaurants such as The Fat\nDuck. His work intensely\nanalyses how our senses\ninfluence our dining ex-perience. For example, he\ninvestigates how colours\nand symmetry can affect\nthe perception and enjoyment of food.\nAnother member of\nthe development team is\nRoger Kneebone, Professor of Surgical Education\nand Engagement Science.\nHe believes the benefits\nwill extend beyond culinary and chemistry. \u201cThe\nChemical Kitchen will\nencourage social cohesion\namongst\nstudents, developing\na sense of collegiality\nrather than competition\nwithin a safe environment\nthat encourages personal\ngrowth and supportive\nbehaviour,\" he said.\nThe techniques covered\nby The Chemical Kitchen\nwere tested out by an\nalumna from the Department of Chemistry,\nKaterina Stavri. She said:\n\u201cThis great initiative will\nprovide a fun, non-threat-ening chemistry 'laborato-ry' for first year students\nallowing them to gain\npractical experience in\na non-competitive envi-ronment. There are a lot\nof similarities between\na chemistry laboratory\nand an experimental\nkitchen; from thoroughly\nrecording observations to\nmaintaining a clean and\ntidy work-space, students\nwill have the opportunity\nto gain, practice and\nenhance skills needed in\nthe lab in an interdisciplinary setting.\n\u201cA Chemical Kitchen\nrequires creativity and\nintuition in the same way\nas research labs; this lab\nserves as a great stepping\nstone for young chemists\nwho will join research\ngroups in later years of\ntheir studies,\" she added.\nAlan Spivey, Assistant\nProvost (Learning &\nTeaching), said: \u201cWhether\nyou want to be a chemist\nor a chef, skills such as\nmeticulous planning and\ndetailed observation and\nrecording are vital. The\nplan is to encourage safe\nexperimental practice,\npractical reproducibility\nand appreciation of the\noften-overlooked parallels between the practice\nof chemistry and myriad\nother activities which\nrequire manual dexterity\nso as to inspire our students to excel as experimental scientists.\u201d\nThe connection\nbetween cooking and laboratory chemistry is not\nas far-fetched as it seems.\nCooking an egg can\nexemplify how proteins\nare denatured by heat.\nA simple baking lesson\nwould expose students to\nconcepts of fermentation,\ntemperature, and humid-ity.\nCulinary science and\nchemistry also overlap in\nterms of apparatus. Chefs\nare increasingly using scientific equipment in their\nkitchens: centrifuges can\nbe used to extract the oil\nfrom a puree; rotary evaporators can concentrate\nmixtures to strengthen\nflavor; sonic homoge-nizers can be useful in\ntenderizing meat.\nImperial College alumna Katerina Stavri and chef Jozef\nYoussef // Geoff Pugh for The Telegraph\nImperial College Chemistry students to be offered\ncooking classes next autumn\n3\nISSUE 1710\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAndy Djaba \u2013 Felix Editor\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nJANUARY, 2018 FELIX\nEDITORIAL\nThe Felix Team\nEditor-in-Chief\nAndy Djaba\n\u2022\nDeputy Editor\nJoanna Wormald\n\u2022\nNews Editors\nJoanna Wormald\nFrank Leggett\n\u2022\nPolitics Editors\nAvirup Banerjee\nDivyen Vanniasegaram\nJuan Rubio Gorrochategui\n\u2022\nComment Editors\nAida Manzano Kharman\nCharlie Titmuss\n\u2022\nScience Editors\nRosie Dutt\nEyad Abuelgasim\nHenry Alman\nS\u00e2nziana Foia\n\u2022\nTech Editor\nKrithika Balaji\nHaaris Asghar\n\u2022\nArts Editors\nClaire Chan\nHelen Money-Kyrle\nVaishnavi Gnanananthan\n\u2022\nBooks Editors\nJJ Cheng\n\u2022\nMusic Editors\nSimran Kukran\nAdrian LaMoury\nHenry Eshbaugh\nAsad Raja\n\u2022\nFilm Editors\nMikhail Demtchenko\nSung Soo Moon\nAidan Chan\n\u2022\nInvestment Editor\nTom Alston\n\u2022\nFood Editors\nEva Tadros\nJulia D\u0105browska\n\u2022\nTravel Editor\nJoana Correia\n\u2022\nPuzzles Editors\nLorenzo Silvestri\nLisa Hey\n\u2022\nSports Editor\nImraj Singh\nFergus Johnson\n\u2022\nCopy Editors\nRhidian Thomas\nChimdi Igwe\nJia Qi Tan\nAnand Krishnakumar\nShervin Sabeghi\nCONTENTS\nEDITORIAL\nNEWS\nCOMMENT\nPOLITICS\nSCIENCE\nBOOKS\nMUSIC\nARTS\nFILM\nGAMES\nFOOD\nSUSTAINABILITY\nINVESTMENT\nHANGMAN\nTRAVEL\nPUZZLES\nSPORTS\n2\n3-5\n6-7\n8\n9-10\n11\n12\n13-15\n18\n19-22\n23\n24\n25\n28-29\n30\n31\n32\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort\nRoad\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Mortons Media\nGroup, Boston Road,\nHorncastle, Lincolnshire\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2017\nTHE BAG!\nT\nhe worst part\nabout having\na New Year's\nResolution is the\ninevitable disappointment\nwhen you eventually flop.\nI managed to last a grand\ntotal of 17 days before\nflopping every single\none of my resolutions.\nIt was all going so well.\nUnfortunately, It is now\n17th\nJanuary and I've only\nbeen to the gym once in\n2019, I haven't touched\na book since 2nd\nJanuary\nand it is currently after\n11pm and I am writing my\neditorial.

The main aim of\nthe campaign is to reduce\nthe carbon footprint of\nthe college and work\ntowards a more sustainable college. Throughout\nJanuary and February\nImperial will be holding\nvarious events relating\nto meat consumption and\nsustainability (see the\naccompanying timetable).\nOn Mondays and\nFridays between 12-2.00pm, there are pop-up\nstalls in JCR and SCR so\nas to get engage the community and get feedback\non Meat-Free Mondays.\nComments and opinions\nare welcomed.\nA screening of\nCarnage will be held in\nthe Grantham Institute\non Wednesday, 23rd of\nJanuary. A satire mockumentary by comedian\nSimon Amstell, Carnage,\nset in a meat free future,\nmakes light of both vegans\nand meat-eaters of today.\nOn the 26th VegSoc is\norganizing a trip to the\nFRIEND animal sanctu-ary, where you can muck\nin, for instance cleaning\nchicken sheds or helping\nlivestock which have been\nrescued from abusive\nowners or found aban-doned. There are limited\nspaces. Email vegsoc@\nimperial.ac.uk to register\ninterest.\nIs veganism healthy?\nThis is a question that\noften draws a great deal of\nempassioned but also unsubstantiated debate. UCL\nand Imperial students\nhave begun a campaign\nto make at least a half\nof food consumed at the\nuniversity vegan by 2020.\nThis campaign is launching with a talk on nutrition\nat UCL on the 28th. Well\nworth attending if you\nwould like to be involved\nor are considering a vegan\ndiet. Also a chance to see\nthe \u201cother\u201d university.\nShould the production\nof meat be banned? Expect\na heated debate right\nhere in Imperial, as four\nexperts come together in\nearly February to discuss\nthis proposition.\nLast but certainly not\nleast, \u201cEarthling Ed\u201d, an\ninfluential activist with\nover 9 million views on\nYoutube will be visiting to\nImperial in late February.\nVisit imperialcollege-union.org/mfm to sign-up\nfor events and more info\non Meat-Free Mondays.\nOddly inspiring\nI\n\u2019d like to believe that\nevery one of us, at\nleast in part, can do\nsomething better for\nthe environment. But I\nalso know that for some,\nthis can seem dauting,\ndifficult, or just too time\nconsuming - which is\nwhy, I thought I\u2019d share\nmy experience with\nODDBOX, a UK based\ncompany committed to\ntackling food waste. One\nof the United Nations\nsustainable development\ngoals is halving the per\ncapita global food waste\nby 2030. Yet, globally\n1.3 billion tonnes of food\nproduced is being wasted\nevery year. In UK alone,\n3 million tonnes of food\n(1/3 of the total produce!)\ndon\u2019t even reach the\nsuper market shelves,\nsimply because they are\nvegetables from local\ngrowers and markets at\na fair price and deliver\nthem to people all across\nLondon, including areas\nnear the Imperial campus.\nThis not only reduces the\namount of produce going\nto waste but also supports\nlocal farmers. Besides,\nthese fruits and vegetable\ndidn\u2019t have to fly or sail\nacross the ocean to get\nto us, ultimately reducing\nthe carbon footprint.\nPersonally, what I\u2019ve\nloved most about Oddbox\nis that they provide a\nvariety of produce, all\nof which are seasonal;\nthis means getting the\nopportunity to cook with\nunfamiliar ingredients,\nsuch as rainbow carrots,\nhispi cabbages, and purple\nsprouting broccolis.\nEven cooking with them\nis made easy, as every\nOddbox delivery comes\nwith a simple recipe for\npotential meals that can be\nmade using the contents\nin the box that week.\nThe boxes are also conveniently delivered right\noutside the house, so the\nexcitement of waking up\nevery Thursday morning\nto unravel the unknown\ncontents of a new oddbox\nwaiting outside my\ndoorstep feels almost\nlike a weekly Christmas\npresent. This also means\nthat I don\u2019t have to spend\ntime walking to and\naround the supermarket\nfor grocery shopping.\nAnother excellent feature\nwhich I appreciate is the\nfact that unlike every\nsingle fruit and vegetable\nunnecessarily dressed\nfrom head to toe in plastic\nat the supermarkets,\noddbox deliveries are\nhardly ever wrapped\nin any plastic (with the\nexception of Spinach!);\nThey come straight in\ncardboard boxes which\nare reused or recycled,\nvariety of order options,\nincluding veg only, or\na combination of fruit\nand veg, and in sizes of\nsmall, medium and large.\nA small veg and fruit\nbox is probably ideal for\ncollege students to last\nfor a week, and only costs\n10.49 pounds for a hearty\nquantity. Payment is on a\nweekly basis, so you can\neasily cancel any time\nyou travel or simply don\u2019t\nhave time to cook.\nWith Oddbox, you\u2019re\nnot only saving money\nand making your life\neasier, but also contributing to solving the\nglobal food waste issue\nand other environmental\nproblems.

Eventually the curtains rose to\nreveal Richard Thomas\non the piano, while Sooz\nKempner, Adam Perchard\nand Kevin Davie sang a\ncomical, overly dramatic\nintroduction to the show.\nSuddenly Jonny Woo\ntook to the stage and\ninstantly I was bedazzled\nby his glittering EU flag\nthemed jumpsuit; in what\nappeared to be an even\nmore fabulous version of\nStrictly Come Dancing.\nGiving the audience a\nfew moments to process\nthe majesty of his outfit, an\nintroduction was provided\nabout the show that was\npromptly followed by a\nmusical number about the\nday of the referendum,\ndepicting both sides of the\ndebate and how the public\nreacted to the results. Now\nsomething I absolutely\nloved about the production\nis how it remained neutral\nby taking an equal number\nof jabs at both sides,\nwith remainers being\nportrayed as exaggerated\nweed- smoking hipsters\nand leavers portrayed as\nright-wing racists; with\nthis, an absurd balance\nwas achieved.\nWhen it comes to\nthe showcasing of\npoliticians the show\npulls no punches, with\nDavid Cameron (Jonny\nWoo), Angela Merkel\n(Diane Chorley), Boris\nJohnson (Jayde Adams),\nNigel Farage (Le Gateau\nChocolat) and Theresa\nMay all being put on the\ncomedic chopping block.\nA particular favourite of\nmine was Jonny Woo\u2019s\ntake on David Xameron,\nas he sung about Cameron\u2019s woes along with a\ntrio of backup singers in a\npolitical rendition of \u201cThe\nThree Little Pigs\u201d, as well\nas Le Gateau Chocolat\u2019s\nperformance as Nigel\nFarage in a magnificent\nopera style performance.\nWith all the turmoil\nthat is Brexit deal ne-gotiations, Jonny Woo\u2019s\nAll-Star Brexit Cabaret\npresents the painful\nchronology of events in\na fantastically comedic\nstyle, along with gorgeous\ncostume design and\nchanges (such a key part\nof the performance that\nthey even had a song for\nit), something I enjoyed\nmost about the show.\nBetween singing sequences there were also periods\nof stand-up comedy that\nfeatured Jayde Adams\u2019\nBoris Johnson impression and Myra Dubois\u2019s\nBritannia performance,\nboth of which could easily\nbe described as comedy\ngold. Not to forget added\nsurprises such as the\nTheresa May choir (the\nlookalikes I mentioned\nearlier) bursting onto the\nstage with flailing arms,\nwith some even daring to\nimitate the technical challenge that is May\u2019s robot\ndance.\nAll in all, the only fault\nthat I could possibly find\nwith Jonny Woo\u2019s All Star\nBrexit Cabaret is that I\nwished it were longer,\nbecause God knows I\nthink everyone wanted\nto laugh more about this\nhorrible mess that we\u2019ve\nfound ourselves in.\nFabulous costumes and hilarious skits // Jonny Woo\nARTS\nConnor Winzar\nArts Writer\nWhere?

It\u2019s been\nsix years since Gravity, a\nfilm that swept the board\nwith its accolades, both\ntechnical and artistic.\nAfter making several\nhigh-profile, comfortably\nbudgeted, \u2018Hollywood\u2019\nfilms, Cuaron brings us\nRoma, his first Spanishlanguage feature since Y\nTu Mama Tambien.\nRoma centres around\nCleo (newcomer Yalitza\nAparicio), a housemaid\nfor a middle-class family\nin the Colonia Roma, a\nsuburb of Mexico City,\nin 1970\u201371. The family\nconsists of parents Sofia\n(Marina de Tavira) and\nAntonio, their four young\nchildren and Sofia\u2019s\nmother, Teresa. Evidently,\nCuaron draws from his\nchildhood, having grown\nup in a family like Sofia\u2019s;\nthese series of events are\nfull of rich detail. Dubbed\nas his most personal film\nyet, you can really feel the\ngrooves of his fingerprints\nin the frame.\nCuaron\u2019s 1970s Mexico\nCity is brought to life\nwithin the shot. Again,\nCuaron employs his trademark \u201cwandering frame\u201d\n\u201cDubbed as his\nmost personal\nfilm yet, you\ncan really feel\nthe grooves of\nhis fingerprints\nin the frame. \u201d\nwhereby the camera is\ndistracted by the stories\nof those who are not the\nmain subjects of the film.\nThe world that that our\nprotagonists inhabit is\nfully realised and given\ncontext. A scene that plays\nout in a furniture shop is\nplaced in the background\nof violent demonstra-tions, now historically\nknown as the Corpus\nChristi Massacre. Our\nprotagonists come face to\nface with danger\u2014what\nstarted in the background\nbecomes part of our\nstory in the foreground.\nThese shifts of focus\nhappen throughout the\nfilm to serve to provide\na grounding in reality,\nand sometimes a liberal\nconstruction of reality.\nThematically, there is\na lot that you can unpick\nfrom the film, but these\ntiny details were made to\nbe absorbed not studied.\nThere is a serene and meditative atmosphere to the\nfilm like a distant memory,\nmisremembered. Quirky\nmoments of absurdity\noccur leading to questions\nin these conscious choices\nin narrative but is never\npretentious. Although\nthe story ventures into\nepisodic melodrama, the\nmundaneness of everyday\nlife is also captured. These\nmoments of stillness in\nthe scene is complemented by the extraordinary\nsound design\u2014part of\nwhat makes this depiction of 1970s Mexico so\nfull-fleshed is the sound-scapes. Strong women\ncharacters drive the drama\nforward; gender politics\nand social issues are adequately presented but are\nnot the focus of the film.\nIn essence, Roma is a\nfamily portrait\u2014a slice of\nlife of an ordinary family,\nbut this is anything but an\nordinary film.\nCuaron directs with a\nquiet confidence. He gets\nthe best out of his cast; the\ntwo female central performances from Aparicio and\nde Tavira are astonishing.\nThe film is, on a technical\nlevel, magnificent. The\nframing always adds to\nbiggest screen (and best\nsound system) available.\nMany in the film industry\nexpress discontent in the\ngreat debate over \u201cfilms\u201d\nprimarily distributed on\nstreaming services and\ntheir eligibility for \u201cfilm\u201d\nawards. Roma serves to\nprove that great cinema\nthat deserves recognition is not limited to its\nplatform\u2014streaming is\nthe future.\nThis movie is in black and white, but it sure isn\u2019t one of the Charlie Chaplin ones // Netflix\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Editor\nDir: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.\nScript: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.\nStarring: Yalitza Aparicio,\nMarina de Tavira, Fernando\nGrediaga, Jorge Antonio\nGuerrero.\n135 minutes\nROMA\nthe drama and frustrates us\nwith more tension.

The drama\nis never overshadowed by\nthe technicalities, but the\ntwo combine effortlessly\nto provide an overwhelming experience. Without\nspoiling the film, the\nscene at the hospital, and\nthe scene at the beach\nare standout moments\nthat are masterful in their\nconstruction and crafts-manship.\nAs for distribution,\nRoma is having a limited\ncinema release, and\nit\u2019s available to stream\non Netflix now. This\ntheatrical run is not just\na cynical bid for awards\nrecognition, as Roma is\ntruly a cinematic film that\nrewards being seen on the\n\u201cRoma serves\nto prove that\ngreat cinema\nthat deserves\nrecognition is\nnot limited to\nits platform\u201d\n\u201cThere is a\nserene and\nmeditative\natmosphere\nto the film\nlike a distant\nmemory,\nmisremem-bered. \u201d\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1710\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nDeath Register: a review\nDeath Register is a book about growing up in Montego Bay, Jamaica. I enjoyed the book but hated every single\ncharacter in it.\nBOOKS\nCharles Titmuss\nComment Editor\nDeath Register is a\nnovel outside my literary\ncomfort zone. It follows\nthe formative years of\nChauncey Knuckle and his\ngroup of friends, growing\nup in the city of Montego\nBay. It explores their\nrelationships with their\npeers, their families and\ntheir teachers against the\nintensely homophobic and\npatriarchal background of\nJamaica in the 90s.\nChauncey\u2019s story is\ndirectly driven by the\nconflict between himself\nand his best friend Tristan.\nTristan is a homosexual\nand, while working\ntogether, Chauncey\nwitnesses him being\nsexually abused by their\nemployer. Chauncey fails\nto do anything, either to\nreport the incident or to\nintervene on his friend\u2019s\nbehalf, which Tristan\nis aware of. Tristan and\nChauncey also experience\ndirect academic rivalry\nat the elite private school\nthat they have attained\nscholarships to. Chauncey\nexcels as a writer, but\nstruggles with mathemat-ics, while Tristan is naturally gifted in this field.\nThese different factors\ndrive resentment between\nthe two, in addition to the\nstruggle that Chauncey\nfeels when it comes to\naccepting his friend\u2019s\nhomosexuality.\nThe men and boys\nthroughout this novel\nare portrayed in a mostly\nnegative light due to the\nauthor\u2019s interpretation\nof toxic masculinity in\nJamaica,tothepointwhere\nthe main characters are\nfundamentally unlikeable.\nFathers beat their sons\nwith the flats of machetes;\nthe sons are all revolting\nperverts, misogynists\nand bullies and the main\ncharacter has a penchant\nfor both writing about\nand employing sexual\nviolence against his girl-friend. I\u2019m beginning to\nfeel a little exhausted with\nthis particular character\ntrope; if mums can get\noff to the idea of a rapey\nman then maybe it\u2019s about\ntime we did away with\nthis stereotype to avoid\nmaking characters into\nunintentional parodies of\nChristian Grey.\nOne of the key themes\nin this book is intolerance of homosexuality.\nWords like \u201cbattybwoy\u201d\nand phrases such as \u201cnohomo\u201d crop up all over\nthe dialogue. The climax\nof the book, or at least one\nof the climaxes, occurs as\na result of Tristan being\ncaught having sex with\none of the male school-masters. He is beaten\nup and then referred to a\ncultish schoolboy secret\nsociety that passes judgement on such matters. He\nis tried in absentia and\nexpelled from the school.\nAnyone associated with\nhim is ostracised from\ntheir peers, save one of his\nfriends that is alleged to\nbe gay but makes a speech\nat the trial rejecting gay\nrights as incompatible\nwith human rights. All in\nall, pretty fucked.\nThere are other important themes throughout the\nbook, such as the conflict\nbetween the wealthy and\nthe poor. Homeless people\nare ruthlessly exploited by\nthe wealthy for sex, with\nhomeless men engaging in\nsex acts with the local big\nmen and women working\nin the aforementioned\nbrothels.\nThe ending of the book\nwas mostly lacklustre.\nTristan is shot by corrupt\npolice officers as a result\nof his involvement with\na drugs gang. Chauncey\nreflects on his relationship\nwith Tristan and admits\nthat he was not entirely\nhonest with himself or his\nfriend as he loved him. I\nnever really felt that this\ndegree of affection was\neffectively demonstrated\nby the author\u2019s writing\nand, instead of leaving me\nwith a sense of sadness at\nthis unrequited affection, I\nfelt absolutely nothing.\nI didn\u2019t really em-pathise with either \u2013 or\nindeed any \u2013 of the\ncharacters. They all felt\nalmost entirely flawed,\ntied together by a series\nof events that seemed to\nemerge out of the smog\nof the narrative. It felt\nlike, in trying to portray\nJamaica in its entirety,\nthe author brought much\nof what should have been\nbackground into the fore-ground. The plot lurched\nfrom event to event and\nthe characters then failed\nto react in a believable\nmanner. I felt like the\nstory would be much more\ninteresting were it written\nfrom Tristan\u2019s perspec-tive, as he is a character\nthat would be far easier to\nempathise with.\nThat does not mean\nto say that this is a not a\nbook you should read. It\nexposed me to a degree\nof toxic masculinity that\nabsolutely made me uncomfortable and consider\nmy own behaviour. The\ninnovative style by which\nChauncey both experiences and writes about events\nin the book is interesting\nand exposes more of\nthe character without\nengaging in prolonged\ninternal monologues.\nIt is a rich portrayal of\na Jamaican city in the\n90s and contains some\nprofound sections and\ncharacters. The strongest example of this is\nChancey\u2019sAunt.Although\nbeautiful, intelligent and\ncompassionate, she is\nbarren and as a result\nhas settled for an abusive\nJamaica \u2013 looks pretty // Flickr\nboyfriend. She is possibly\none of the only characters\nin the book that I liked\nand I found some of the\ndialogue written for her\non misogyny to be rather\nwonderful.\nOverall, Death Register\nis a book that I was not\nready for. Although I was\naware of the degree of\nhomophobia present in\nJamaica, I was unaware\nof the extent. I must\nalso admit that I found\nthe portrayal of the\ncharacter\u2019s life and their\nattitudes towards women\nvery much at odds with\nmy own worldview and\nexperiences. That being\nsaid I think that this book\nraises important questions\nabout masculinity in\nJamaica and masculinity\nin general. It probably\nwas not really suited for\na sheltered white boy like\nmyself.\n\n"

The one move these\nTory Brexiteers have left\nis to leave the party and\nvote against her in a vote\nof no confidence. What\nwould happen afterwards\nthough?Ageneral election\nwhere they wouldn\u2019t stand\na chance of winning and\nthe outcome would be\nin all likelihood a softer\nBrexit. The only reason\nthe Brexiteers are happy\nat this point is because if\nParliament cannot agree\non anything then the\nUK leaves on no deal\nterms. This is a game of\nhigh stakes poker, but\nultimately the Brexiteers\nwill lose with remain MPs\nalso prepared to go to\nextraordinary lengths to\nprevent a no deal Brexit.\nIf the rest of Parliament is\nable to work together then\nthe Brexiteer cause will be\ndead in the water.\nWhat the country needs\nis a Prime Minister with\nthe confidence to stand\nagainst those in her own\nparty who are Brexit\nideologues who would in\nall likelihood be unhappy\nwith any deal. Doing so\neven at the risk of splitting\nthe Conservative party.\nThis kind of split would\nbe the first of its kind since\nPeel in the 19th century,\nbut the Conservative\nparty survived and would\nultimately survive another\nsplit. This reckoning has\nbeen on the horizon since\nBrexit happened. Time\nand time again rather\nthan facing this head on,\nMay has dithered, wasted\ntime and kicked the can\ndown the road, putting\nthe interests of her party\nahead of the country. She\nhas been the architect of\nthe constitutional crisis\nbetween Parliament and\nthe government. MPs have\nresorted to Parliamentary\nguerrilla warfare, passing\nmotions and amendments\nto seize control from the\ngovernment over Brexit in\nthe absence of any leadership or solutions from the\ngovernment. Our system\nwas never designed for\nthis.\nIt\u2019s promising that\nTheresa May has agreed\nto meet with the leaders\nof other parties to find a\nway forward and signals\nthat she may compromise\ntowards a soft Brexit,\nhighlighting the waste\nof time everything up\nto this point. Given that\nother leaders have met\nwith Theresa May, it\u2019s\ndisappointing that Corbyn\nhas so far not taken part in\nthese meetings. It would\nappear to be solely a\npolitical decision to avoid\nmaking any tough decisions himself and to not\nappear to be supporting\nthe government and the\nConservatives. May will\nneed to give up several of\nwhether to back a second\nreferendum and deliver\na Brexit that would be\nmost palatable to his party\nmembers. Once Brexit\nhappens, things may well\nbecome easier for Corbyn.\nPro-EU Labour members\nand MPs will gain far\nless traction in calls for a\nsecond referendum with\nthe wider public once\nthe issue appears settled.\nCorbyn can then focus on\nhis attention on bashing\nthe Tories over cuts and\nthe NHS, certainly more\nnatural territory for him.\nBrexit has been fascinating to follow and will\ncontinue to deliver. We\nare entering a new stage of\nthis process, and anyone\nwould be a fool for confidently calling the outcome\nnow. Any one of no deal,\na referendum or a new\ndeal could still happen. A\nreferendum feels unlikely\nas it will not happen with\nMay as Prime Minister\nand if one thing has been\nconsistent over the last\nfew years is her steadfast-ness. No deal shouldn\u2019t\nhappen if Parliament gets\nits act together aided by\nthe Speaker leaving some\nkind of soft deal as the\nmost likely outcome.\nTheresa May // Wikimedia\n\u201cCorbyn is\nacting purely\nfor political\ninterest to\navoid the\ntough choices\nhe faced\u201d\nher red lines and bargaining chips including no\ndeal if she is to make any\nprogress in talks with opposition leaders anyway.\nBy taking part in the talks\nLabour and the other\nopposition parties stand\na much better chance of\npushing Theresa May\ntowards a soft Brexit with\na customs union.

Thanks to\nsome excellent DJing, the\njourney flew by.\nThe team rose early on\nSaturday to make a trip\nto the local Shrewsbury\nparkrun \u2013 one of a large\nnational network of free,\nweekly and timed 5km\nruns every Saturday at\n9.00am.\nHuddling around the\nbandstand for warmth,\nthe runners listened to the\ncourse instructions carefully as they all wanted to\nleave their mark on one\nof the country\u2019s largest\nparkruns.\nAlmost 700 runners - a\ncourse record - gathered\non the start line along the\nRiver Severn, and then\nthey were off!\nThe course was far from\nflat, with a steep hill to\nclimb and descend around\n\u201cThe Dingle\u201d followed\nby a fast out-and-back\n\u201cThey all\nwanted to\nleave their\nmark on one of\nthe country\u2019s\nlargest\nparkruns\u201d\n\u201cThe squad\nwere forced to\nmake a visit to\nthe infamous\n\u201ctuck shop\u201d\u201d\ntarmac path along the\nriver with a turn around\n\u201cThe Monument\u201d before a\nsecond lap.\nICXCAC\u2019s runners\nwere focused, taking a\nruthless racing line around\nthe bends and cheering on\neach other as they passed\nin opposing directions.\nThe field was led\nhome by Niki Faulkner\nwith a time of 16:01, and\nwhilst he was (slightly)\ndisappointed not to go\nsub-16, he was the only\nteam member not to be\nbeaten by the 17-year-old\nlocal who crossed the line\nsecond in 16:20.\nFollowing him in\nbronze position was\nHenry Hart in 16:39 and\nfresher Alix Vermeulen\ncame in 3rd for the girls\nwith a time of 19:33.\nAfter hassling some\nother locals for a team\nphoto (above), the team\nreturned to base for a\nlarge brunch before a trip\nto the host\u2019s old school\nfor a training session with\ntheir cross country team.\nThe squad was led\naround the \u201cprestigious\u201d\ncourse on a warm-up by\na gaggle of young talent,\nheaded by a rapid 13-year-old.\nFollowing the warm-up\nthe team got their breath\nback and with the route\nfresh in their minds,\neveryone aligned on the\nstart line ready for a timed\nlap.\nThe aim for the\nImperial athletes was to\nnavigate the course from\nmemory but this proved\nconsiderably harder than\nit sounds.\nICXCAC made a\nstrong start with 4 of their\nboys in the top 6, and this\ncontinued for around half\na lap with the strong 13\nyear-old kindly shouting\ndirections to ensure no\nillegal shortcuts were\ntaken.\nJust as Niki was beginning to pull away and\ntake a commanding lead,\ndisaster struck!

Keen to resume\nthe lead, Niki and Men\u2019s\nCaptain Jack McKeon\ndesperately tried to find\na way through a rather\nbushy hedge but to no\navail. They were forced\nto retrace their steps as\nShrewsbury\u2019s speedy\nyouth stormed ahead.\nBefore long it was the\nhome straight and the 13-year-old zoomed home in\n3rd place, delighted that\nhe would be moving up\nthe school leaderboard.\nNiki and Jack arrived at\nthe finish line distraught,\nand the squad were forced\nto make a visit to the\ninfamous \u201ctuck shop\u201d to\ncheer themselves up.\nThe evening saw\nplenty of stretching,\nkazoo playing, refuelling,\nPictionary, cross-country\nwatching, dubious scat-tergories and questionable\nchat.\nSunday morning was\nquite an effort for the few\nwho made a poor decision\nto stay awake until the\nearly hours, but amazingly\nall the non-injured athletes\nmade it out for a trail\nrunning adventure starting\nfrom their doorstep.\nAfter racing up a\nnumber of hills the club\ncaptain set his sights on\na particularly large hill\nhe had dubbed \u201cKilimanjaro\u201d. Only the bravest\n(most foolish?) explorers\nopted for this option and\nthey pranced up to the\nsummit like mountain\ngoats, battling the\nnear-vertical ascent and\nhowling winds.\nEventually they all\nreturned safely and set\nabout packing for the trip\nback to London.\nThe large quantity of\nfood remaining meant\nthe final lunch was a delicious buffet of spaghetti,\nchicken sausages, mashed\npotato, tomatoes, apples,\nunripe bananas and\nleftover bolognese.\nHaving survived this\nordeal, the squad hit the\nroad and returned feeling\nrevitalised and ready for\nthe cross-crountry season\nto resume next week.\nThe merry band of runners stand in front of a merry bandstand // ICXC\nNiki storms into the lead at Shrewsbury parkrun // ICXC\n\n"

Many students\nperhaps understandably\nfeel that their lifestyle and\nidentity is under attack.\nLess understandable is\nhow eating meat is so key\nto their identity, and even\nless intelligible is how\none or at most two meals\nwithout meat a week constitutes an attack on said\nsenseless identity.\nThe second thing that\nhas become clear is that\nthis is apparently the fault\nof \u201cthe vegans\u201d. Not the\nWHO\u2019s, who have clearly\nstated that meat consumption is tied to cancer risk.\nNor is it the IPCC environmental scientists\u2019fault,\ndespite the demonstrably\nhigh impact of animal\nagriculture on climate\nchange which, it may be\nworth remembering, is\nsomething we need to\nsolve soon before we leave\nour planet uninhabitable\nfor the next generation.\nNo. It is clearly the vegans\nwho are at fault. The\nvegans must be in control,\nbecause why else would\nthere be no meat nor dairy\nnor fish on campus on\nMondays. Except there\u2019s\nstill fish. And all the dairy.\nAnd sandwiches aren\u2019t\neven included in meat free\nMondays.\nPerhaps if it weren\u2019t for\nthe incessant muddying\nof waters with regards to\ninfringement of personal\nfreedoms and social\nresponsibility, as found\nin the American question\nof guns as well as other\nendless political debates,\nthen it might be easier\nto tolerate people being\nso pathetically whiny\nabout meat free Mondays.\nUnfortunately, eating less\nmeat isn\u2019t just a question\nof personal preference or\nhow much you\u2019re willing\nto do for the environment.\nIt\u2019s not enough anymore,\nif it ever was, for some\npeople to stop eating meat\nonce a week. We need\nsocietal change because,\nface it: you live in a\nsociety. We all live on the\nsame dying blue dot. My\nnot eating meat means\nas this. If you need help\nchanging, I\u2019m here to\nhelp. If you\u2019re unwilling\nto change, it makes no\nsense for everyone else to\nsit around and watch you\nmess things up for the rest\nof us. You need to change\nas much as anyone else.\nSo, are meat free\nMondays okay? Well,\nthey\u2019re the smallest step\nin the right direction that\nwe should be happy to\nsupport. It\u2019s one meal a\nweek, people, and it\u2019s\nonly pescatarian. What\u2019s\nnot okay is how pathetic\nand incapable some\npeople seem to be when\npresented with vegetarian\nfood.\nA travesty has occured at Imperial\nMeat-free Mondays are an assault on everything that we hold dear at Imperial: unethical\nconsumption under capitalism.\nT\nhe vegetarians, or\nvegans or whatever powerful\nfruit- and veg-based cult that apparently\nruns this university has\nstruck again. If you, like\nmyself, are a carnivore\ninnocently minding\nyour own business, you\nwill have run into the\nhorror that is meat-free\nMondays. How is it that\nthese green-fingered\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nsandal-wearing tree-hug-gers have moved from\nbeing shunned at the\nedges of society to having\nenough power to manipulate what I can eat for\nlunch? Much like other\nextreme political ideologies that emerge from\nthe shadows to oppress us\nnormal-red blooded meat\nlovers, the animal friends\nconvention has risen up.\nNow is the winter of our\ndiscontent.\nHow is it that the vegetable slime can impose\ntheir will upon us. Some\nof them make the claim\nthat the Union has the\nmandate to rule on what I sentiment. I personally\nbelieve in climate change,\nbut I believe that people\nundersell the potential\nbenefits. For one thing it\nmay get warmer and for\nanother, it might drown all\nthose pesky tax havens. I\nbelieve it is my personal\nduty to stimulate as much\ndemand as possible for\nthat aim alone. That alone\nwould be worth it, not\nwithstanding the joy of\neating a juicy steak.\nSome argue that this\napproach is about making\nus healthier and happier as\na result of giving up meat\nfor a day a week. What\na bunch of hypocrites.\nAre they not all addicted\nto the most unhealthy,\ndiabetes inducing food\nof all- sugar? Sugar is\nmanently with no chance\nof it being subject to the\nsame sanctions.\nIn summary, as much\nas I can no longer get an\nerection without looking\nat the portrait of the\nqueen, why is it that the\nveggie extremists cannot\ncomprehend that I cannot\nbring myself to eat unless\nI know that a semi-sen-tient animal has suffered?\nSomething must die for\nme to live.

    "content": "The Queen of Spades: ROH disappoints\nI\nt\u2019s been a long while\nsince I\u2019ve found an\nopera more enjoyable\nwith my eyes shut\nthan open. But with a\ndirector who says things\nlike \u2018Opera is not about\ngiving people a good\ntime,\u2019 perhaps I shouldn\u2019t\nhave been surprised.\nStefan Herheim\u2019s gamble\nwith Tchaikovsky\u2019s The\nQueen of Spades tries too\nhard to be clever, making\nfor a bewildering, boring\nand generally unenjoyable\nproduction.\nInstead of Tchaikovsky\u2019s magnificent\noverture, the curtains rise\nto \u2018Tchaikovsky\u2019 performing fellatio on a prostitute.\nThis rather distasteful\nopening is just the beginning of the humiliation\nof the poor composer.\nHerheim wants us to view\nThe Queen of Spades\nas the product of Tchaikovsky\u2019s struggle with\nrepressed homosexuality.\nTo this end, the Tchaikovsky figure (played\nby Vladimir Stoyanov)\nremains on stage throughout the opera, scribbling\non loose sheets of paper\nand mock-playing on\nthe piano as though he is\nwriting the events of the\nopera in real time.\nThe midnight confrontation between Gherman\nand the Countess?\nThere\u2019s Tchaikovsky,\nskulking in the corner.\nAt the apparition of the\nCountess\u2019 ghost? There\nhe is again, playing the\npiano with unnecessary\nmelodrama. Gherman\u2019s\nand Liza\u2019s passionate love\ndeclaration? There he is\ntoo, chivvying the protagonists towards each other\nlike some kind of maiden\naunt. It is completely\ndistracting. The emotional\nintensity of each scene is\nutterly lost \u2013 something\nHerheim clearly intends,\nsince he has the characters\npretending to sing off\n\u2018scripts\u2019 like actors at an\naudition.\nThe worst part of it is\nthat this butchering of\nthe opera isn\u2019t even to\nany point. Unlike what\nHerheim would have us\nbelieve, The Queen of\nSpades is not the invention\nof Tchaikovsky\u2019s torment-ed, gay mind. It was based\non Pushkin\u2019s short story of\nthe same name mocking\nhuman greed, and trying\nto reinvent it as the\nproduct of Tchaikovsky\u2019s\ntortured soul just does not\nmake any sense no matter\nhow hard Herheim tries.\nIt\u2019s unclear what each of\nthe characters signify and\nhow this is all supposed\nto tie into Tchaikovsky\u2019s\nhomosexuality.\nTo be fair, it isn\u2019t just\nthe direction \u2013 this production suffers musically\nas well. Maybe we can\u2019t\nblame the singers for\nbeing as bewildered as the\naudience. Stoyanov, who\n(mystifyingly) plays both\nTchaikovsky and Prince\nYeletsky, was among the\nbetter singers here, with\none of the few highlights\nof the evening being his\naria \u2018Ja vas lyublyu\u2019.\nAleksandrs Antonenko\nas Gherman is another\nstory altogether. Was he\nsinging, or shouting? At\nfirst I thought he was being\nintentionally discordant\nfor the sake of acting, but\nI soon realised it wasn\u2019t a\nconscious decision at all.\nEva-Maria Westbroek,\nstarring opposite him\nas Liza, wavered in her\nsinging and seemed to\nrun out of breath in the\nlonger passages. The one\nbright spot was Anna\nGorvachova, who sang\nexcellently as the side\ncharacter Paulina (Liza\u2019s\nfriend, here \u2018reimagined\u2019\nby Herheim as her lesbian\nlover).\nEven Tchaikovsky\u2019s\nbeautiful music failed\nto charm. The ROH\norchestra, conducted by\nAntonio Pappano, played\nsome of the most confron-tational, unsubtle Tchaikovsky I\u2019ve ever heard.\nPerhaps Pappano was\nsuffering from a Wagner\nhangover after last year\u2019s\nRing Cycle?\nThe set was, at least,\ntechnically excellent,\nwith backlit panels of\nbookshelves seamlessly\nchanging the stage from\nbedroom to ballroom.\nVisually arresting, the\nset designs came across\nas slightly histrionic at\ntimes, - at one point the\nlarge chandelier started\nswinging across the stage\nwhile spewing smoke,\nlike Phantom of the Opera\ngone wrong.\nTo prolong the misery,\nThe Queen of Spades is\nhardly a short and sweet\nopera. 7 acts long, at the\ninterval I found myself\nwondering how I would\nmanage to get through\nthe second half. At times\nit felt like we were just\nbeing shouted at \u2013 by\nAntonenko and Westbroek, by Pappano and the\norchestra, by Herheim\nand his harebrained ideas.\nTchaikovsky would\nhave been rolling in his\ngrave. Wait \u2013 he was\ndoing quite enough\nrolling about on stage\nalready, being kicked\nand jeered at by his out-of-control characters and\nmade a laughingstock for\nthe audience. Far from\nbeing a sensitive exploration of Tchaikovsky\u2019s\nmindset and motives,\nHerheim\u2019s adaptation is\na disrespectful and disappointing bastardisation of\nan opera once described\nby Tchaikovsky as \u2018my\nmasterpiece\u2019.\nStefan Herheim\u2019s production delivers confusion in spades\nPoor Pyotr Ilych // Catherine Ashmore\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\n14\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

If this isn\u2019t a scenic\nlanding, I don\u2019t know\nwhat is.\nLisbon truly offers\nit all. And I\u2019m not just\ntalking about the custard\ntarts. It is hard to write\nabout something you so\npassionately love.\nLisbon\u2019s city centre\nis not like many others\nin Europe. The streets\nare wide, with intricate\npavement patterns (known\nas cal\u00e7ada), the buildings\nare made of colourful\ntiles, the yellow trams go\nup and down the hills, narrowing into the traditional\nold neighbourhoods of\nLisbon. You\u2019ll find over\n30 beautiful terraces and\nhilltops overlooking the\ncity and the river, where\nboth tourists and locals\nmeet for drinks, thoughts\nand long conversations.\nYou\u2019ll find a lot of street-based shopping, from\nhigh street brands to independent quirky shops. Old\nversus modern museums\nand cathedrals, some lost\nin the city depths (Bas\u00edlica\nda Estrela) others sitting\nriverside (MAAT).\nBeing a waterfront city\nmeans you can get away\nfrom the overwhelming\ncity sounds by strolling\nriverside. There are plenty\ncaf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants,\nnightclubs and parks\nalong the river for one to\npick from, sit down and\nrelax or dance the night\naway. Take the train for 30\nminutes, swap the traffic\nsounds for seagulls and\nwaves, the warmth kissing\nyour skin, a cold drink\nin hand, you\u2019ve found\nthe ocean.

Food, for instance,\nis one of those things. We\ndine late and we love to\nstay at restaurants long\nafter the meal has ended,\njust drinking and chatting\nfor possibly too long. If\nthere is outdoor seating\nwe might actually stay\nforever. So apologies\nif you find yourself in\na queue! Best advice:\nembrace the Portuguese\nway.\nspeaking Portuguese too\nloud (yes, even louder,\nand as if that would help\nanyone understand\u2026).\nPeople will want to know\nabout your life, where you\nare from, what you do,\nwhat brings you over. Not\nbecause we are nosy, but\nbecause you\u2019re new.\nLisbon is becoming increasingly touristy \u2013 many\nsay this with criticism, I\nsay it with appreciation.\nPeople still go on about\ntheir lives (don\u2019t really\nhave a choice do they?),\nbut still go out at traditional and new places,\nstill visit all the above and\nmany other locations that\none could consider tourist\nattractions, still love their\ncity. I believe that this\nis what, above all else,\nmakes the hype real about\nLisbon. You feel like\nyou\u2019re part of the city and\nits life. And for a greater\nfeeling of belonging go\nwhen we\u2019re happiest \u2013\nApril to October.

And\nyet nonetheless, Vox was\nthe first party to do so.\nSending shockwaves\nacross the country, the\nelections in Andalucia\nwere the first elections in\nwhich Vox managed to\nsecure their first members\nof parliament. Although\nthe left-wing PSOE was\nthe most voted party,\nan alliance between the\nright-wing party currently\nin power (PP) and Vox,\nmeant that Andalucia was\ngoverned by a right-wing\nalliance for the first time\nin 36 years.\nBut in what does Vox\nbelieve? And more impor-tantly, why are Spanish\ncitizens voting for them?\nAs one would do to find\nout more about this new\nparty\u2019s proposals, I began\nreading through its official\nelectoral program. What\nI read truly worried me.\nAlthough it is not unusual\nfor political parties to contradict themselves these\ndays, these claims were\nat points so contradictory\nit was almost amusing, if\nit weren\u2019t for the fact that\ntheir aim is to actually\ngovern Spain. Their\nprogram is summed into\n100 short bullet points,\nwhich they market as their\nnew proposal to \u201cmake\nSpain alive\u201d.\nImmediately their first\npoint is to take a jab at\nthe Catalan government,\ncalling their attempt at a\nreferendum a putsch and\nthe politicians putschists.\nInteresting choice of\nwords that I will not\ndelve into. To solve the\nundeniable divide that\nexists between Catalans\nand the rest of the Spanish\ncitizens, they proposed to\nremove the current federal\ngovernment that has been\nin place since the signing\nof the Spanish Constitution of 1978. There is\nno hint at dialogue to try\nto understand where the\ndiscontent in Catalu\u00f1a is\ncoming from, and instead,\ntheir solution is, well,\nyou can\u2019t have conflict\nbetween the federal states\nif you just get rid of the\nfederalstates.Oneperhaps\nkey aspect that might have\nmissed Vox\u2019s final review\nof their program was\nthat, were it not for the\nfederal system currently\nin place and the federal\nelections that are held,\nthey wouldn\u2019t have gained\nany seats in parliament,\nso it was quite baffling to\nread a proposal aimed to\neliminate the very same\nsystem that allowed them\nto even be on the map in\nthe first place.\nAnother eye-catching\nproposal was the reclaiming of Gibraltar. Why, I\nhear you say? The reason\nis uncertain, but what is\nfor sure is that the general\nsecretary of Vox, Jose\nOrtega, can tell you all\nabout his great odyssey in\n2016, when he swam, yes\nyou read correctly, swam,\nall the way to Gibraltar,\nand climbed to the top\nof a mountain to place a\nSpanish flag on its peak. In\nfact, he recounts this great\nepic in such a theatrical\nway that its almost hard\nto believe that he\u2019s being\nserious. If you feel like\ngrabbing some popcorn\nand hearing the tale of this\ngreat Spanish hero, please\ndon\u2019t hesitate to read his\ninterviews on the incident.\nTruly some great content.\nOn a much more\nserious note, they\nfollowed on with the\nimmediate derogation\nof the law of \u201cHistoric\nMemory\u201d. This was a\nlaw put in place to allow\nvictims of persecution in\nthe past to be recognised.\nAmongst its measures, it\nallowed their relatives to\npetition for their bodies\nto be buried with decency\nby retrieving them from\nmass graves, it prohibited\npublic symbolism of\nFranco\u2019s fascist dictatorship and recognised that\nsentences under Franco\u2019s\nregime were unjust\nand prejudiced against\nnon-fascists.\nButVoxisawell-rounded party, not only drawing\ninspiration from the\nfascist past, but also\nkeeping up to date with\nTrump-ist latest tenden-cies. Apparently in Vox\u2019s\neyes, it is also imperative\nto raise an uncrossable\nwall between Ceuta and\nMelilla (Spanish cities\nin north Africa) and\nMorocco.\nIn regards to their\nimmigration policies,\ntheir proposals include\nprohibiting immigrants\nfrom ever obtaining legal\nstatus in Spain were he or\nshe to enter the country\nirregularly, for life. This\nmeans that any immigrant\nentering the country, for\nexample in a dinghy,\nwould never be able to\nsettle in the country, or\nreceive any sort of help,\nincluding medical help.\nThis effectively means\nthat hot returns would\nnot be illegal. Hot returns\nis a term describing the\nStrongly reminiscent of\nthe Emergency Quota Act\nof 1921 in the States, their\nproposal would prioritise\nSpanish speaking immigrants and immigrants\nfrom countries with ties to\nSpain over other countries\nof origins and establish\ntight quotas on other na-tionalities.\nThe final questionable\nproposal on the topic\nunder this section was the\nurge to publish all data on\nnationality and origin regarding statistics of crime\nin Spain. Under the 14th\narticle of the Spanish con-stitution, all citizens have\nthe right to no discrimi-nation, so publishing this\ndata would not only be a\nviolation of privacy, but\nalso an attempt to scapegoat different nationalities\nof people living in Spain\nby portraying them as\ncriminals.\nReading through their\n100 points for a more\nrenovated Spain, all I saw\nwas a perfect recipe for a\nbackwards, xenophobic\ncountry, much like the one\nwe had during Franco\u2019s\ndictatorship. Why would\nanyone vote for these\nreforms? Is it that easy for\nus to forget how damaging\nit was for Spain when the\noutlook was extremism,\nblack and white division\nand complete disregard\nfor dialogue? Are we sure\nwe really want history to\nrepeat itself in that way?\nWhat is certain is that\nno attempts to derogate\nour historic memory will\ndefinitely not erase the\nmistakes of our fascist\npast, and I would much\nrather learn from them\nthan to repeat them.\nSantiago Abascal, leader of Vox // Washington Times \u201cIt is\nimperative\nto raise an\nuncrossable\nwall between\nSpain and\nMorocco\u201d\npractise of returning immigrants without carrying\nout the legally established\nprocedures or meeting the\ninternationally acknowledged guarantees to their\ncountry of origin. Images,\nwitnesses and other\nnumerous sources with\nevidential value accredit\nsuch practices in the cities\nof Ceuta and Melilla and\nthe small islands under\nSpanish sovereignty. It is\na practise that has been\ndeemed illegal by both\nEuropean Court of Human\nRights and the United\nNations.\nBut perhaps the\nmost worrying measure\nproposed on the topic of\nimmigration, is the notion\nof nationality quotas.\n\n"

He\u2019s\nas loud and as flamboyant\nas you would expect from\na panto star. But there\u2019s\nmore beneath the surface\nfor Roy. Faced with aging\nand the inevitable changes\nfacing his beloved art-form, he\u2019s a man hiding\ntremendous emotion\nbehind the fa\u00e7ade of his\nbright yellow gown. In a\nwell timed follow-up to\nthe Christmas pantomime\nseason, The Dame opens\nup a bleaker take on this\ncheerful Christmas staple.\nWriter Katie Duncan\nstarts off with what would\nalready be rich material\nfor exploration. Roy is\nfacing the lack of relevance that has come with\nboth age and the decline\nof pantomime, alongside\nthe death of the British\nseaside town that had\nbeen the traditional stage\nfor pantomime. Surely,\nthere\u2019s more than enough\nhere for a 70 minute\nperformance. But halfway\nthrough, we switch focus.\nIt becomes clear that\nRoy also has a troubled\nchildhood past. An\nabusive father and a child\nshielded by a vulnerable,\nbut ever so loving mother.\nPerhaps it\u2019s cold to be so\ndismissive of such clear\nsentimental bait, but it\nfeels like Duncan has just\ntaken a generic \u2018sad childhood\u2019and added it into the\nmixing pot, almost as a\ncheap cheat for emotional\ndepth.\nThe script also has a\nstrong tendency towards\nhyperbole and the mel-odramatic, and to an\nextent that works. Our\ntitular character is, after\nall, a pantomime dame\nlooking back on his glory\ndays \u2013 a certain flair for\nthe dramatic is to be\nexpected. But Duncan\u2019s\nwriting fails to rein in her\nwords when she takes Roy\nfrom stage performer to\nconfused child, with her\noverly lyrical wording\ndestroying any hope of\nactual immersion in Roy\u2019s\npast.\nThe play is almost\nsaved by Peter Duncan.\nThe former Blue Peter\npresenter delivers a strong\nperformance as Roy,\nalternating between exuberant pantomime dame,\nand troubled man. The\nperformance is almost a\nshowcase of his versatility\nas he easily transitions\nfrom one to the other.\nHowever, even he cannot\nfully salvage this confused\npiece. Roy as a character\nlacks the genuine heart\nneeded to really come to\nlife and as a result, we are\nleft with a performance\nthat somehow rings false.\nLondon\u2019s Fringe theatre\nscene is full of talented\nwriters, and it\u2019s all too frequently that I find myself\nwatching a lacklustre\nproduction of a great\npiece. It\u2019s almost more\nfrustrating that The Dame\nis the exact opposite. The\nPark Theatre\u2019s lovely\nintimate space, simple yet\neffective set and most of\nall, Peter Duncan\u2019s strong\nacting talents are wasted\non this confused piece.\nObscure Shakespeare receives a fun new revival\nT\nhe comedy\ncentres around\nthe lascivious\nSir John Falstaff,\nknown to many from\nShakespeare\u2019s Henry IV\nplays \u2013 The Merry Wives\nof Windsor is said to have\nbeen commissioned by\nElizabeth I herself, who\nmust have felt her beloved\nFalstaff deserving of his\nown story. This play uses\nthis fact as a means of introducing the characters,\nas in the beginning they\ncome in one-by-one with\ntheir names projected onto\nthe background \u2013 I found\nthis immensely helpful in\nkeeping track throughout\nthe play due to the many\ncharacters.\nIn classic Shakespeare\nstyle, the story at times\nfeels like there\u2019s a bit too\nmuch to keep up with,\nwith bizarre sub-plots\nincluding marrying off the\nyoung Anne Page, a confusing dispute between a\nWelsh person and French\ndoctor, a jealous husband\nposing as \u2018Master Brook\u2019\nto trick Falstaff, and the\ninvolvement of Falstaff\u2019s\nservants in his downfall.\nHowever, the main story is\nultimately that of Falstaff\nbeing the subject of Mistresses Ford and Page\u2019s\nschemes \u2013 and rightly so,\nas Falstaff is attempting to\nwomanise them simultaneously (owing to his debt\nand need for money).\nLittle does he know\nthey\u2019ve been tipped off \u2013\nand boy do they have a lot\nin store for him. And so\nthe hilarity ensues, as they\nrepeatedly ruin Falstaff\u2019s\nfoolish attempts to seduce\nthem. The standout\nperformances were those\nof the titular characters,\nMistresses Ford and Page\n(Beth Cordingly and\nRebecca Lacey). There\nwas such incredible and\nsuccinct repartee between\nthem, and every scene\nthey had together lit up\nthe stage with flawless\ncomedic timing.\nDavid Troughton, a\nveteran Royal Shakespeare Company actor,\nalso commands the stage\nin every scene he appears\nin, perfectly depicting\na lecherous and loud\nFalstaff, and as expected,\nnails every bit of verse he\nhas. Naturally then, the\nbest scenes were the ones\nwith all three of these\ncharacters, and there was\nsome fantastic physical\ncomedy alongside the\nbanter \u2013 notably the scene\nwhere Falstaff manages to\nget himself into a wheelie\nbin to hide from Ford.\nThe costumes and\nset design \u2013 a weird,\nnever-before-seen mix\nof Tudor and Essex, with\nneon and glitter amok \u2013\nwere fantastic, and the\nstrange dance scenes at the\nbeginning and end only\nadded to the quirkiness\nof the whole play. There\nwas never a dull moment;\nthere\u2019s humour for even\nthose who typically don\u2019t\nunderstand Shakespeare\u2019s\njokes.

Rumour has it that\nchampagne was popped\nby Bungie staff after the\nannouncement was made.\nActivision in the past\nhave publicly called out\ntheir disappointment with\nthe earnings of Destiny\n2: Forsaken with their\nChief Operating Officer\nCoddy Johnson said that\nthe earnings had failed\nto meet their standards.\nA Bungie developer had\nfired back publicly to this\nstatement:\nComments from\nstrained relationship that\nwe\u2019ve seen over the past\n9 years of their contract.\nActivision expected\nBungie to release a new\ndestiny title every two\nyears from Autumn\nof 2013, but as we all\nknow, Destiny 1 shipped\nin 2014, with Destiny 2\nhaving gone live in 2017,\nwhich makes Bungie a\ntitle behind Activision\u2019s\nschedule. From\nActivision\u2019s massively\nknown franchise \u201cCall of\nDuty\u201d, strict production\nschedules are a classic for\nActivision releases. So in\nsome ways, this divorce\ncould be Activision\naccepting that Destiny has\nnot panned out to be the\nfranchise it expected from\ntheir contract.\nIt\u2019s no understatement\nthat Destiny has a long\nand arduous road to get to\nwhere it is today through\nthe numerous expansions\nand updates during its\nlifetime, which at times\nhave left us Guardians\nwith feelings of joy at the\nnew content but annoyed\nat other times for splitting\nthe player base and letting\nthe microtransactions\nslide straight to our\nbodies.\nTough times for\nActivision\nActivision is truly\ngoing through rough\ntimes though, with\ncustomer backlash and\na drop in their stock\nprices back in November\nafter announcing Diablo\nImmortal for mobile\nphones instead of a full\nPC title. Additionally,\nthey have abandoned their\nSkylanders franchise, so\ncoupled with Destiny,\nActivision\u2019s harem of\nmega-franchises has\ngrown smaller.\nThe future for Bungie\nA Chinese online\ngame company called\nNetEase, which\npublishes Activision\u2019s\n\u201c O v e r w a t c h \u201d ,\n\u201cHearthstone\u201dand\u201cWorld\nof Warcraft\u201d games in\nChina has invested $100\nmillion in Bungie for non-Destiny related IP titles.\nNow that Bungie are\nin full control of their IP,\nthe industry landscape\nallows many options for\nthe developer to continue\ntheir development of\nfuture instalments for\ntheir baby without the\nneed of a publisher. They\nnow no longer need to\nstick to the strict release\nschedules which could\npan out well Guardians.\nLet\u2019s hope that Bungie\ncan now restore the light\nto the 10 million active\nguardians. This will also\nlet us see whether or not if\nsome of the issues which\nplagued Destiny were\nfrom the developer or by\nexecutive meddling from\nthe publisher.\nThe 10-year contract, started in 2010, has not been seen through to the end.

Despite rising 7%\nagainst a broad basket of\ncurrencies in 2018, many\nnow deem the dollar over-valued. Drawing parallels\nfrom both physics and\nForex trading, it is well\nknown that whatever goes\nup must eventually go\ndown. The bear case for\nthe dollar is formed on\nthe expectation that GDP\ngrowth in America will\nslow down. The stimulus\nprovided by Trump\u2019s tax\ncuts last year will fade,\nand increasing Fed Funds\nrates will begin to bite.\nSuffering oil prices, that\nis hurting investment in\nAmerica\u2019s shale regions,\nis another factor as low\ncrude prices becomes beneficial for oil importing\nregions such as Europe\nand Asia. America\u2019s tech\ngiants are also coming\nunder pressure, losing\ntheir invulnerability\nallure they had at the\nbeginning of last year. In\nshort, the recent bull run\non America\u2019s economy\nis coming to end and so\nshould the rise of the\ndollar.\nMansoor Mohi-uddin\nof Natwest Markets\nhas set out three preconditions for a turn in the\ndollar: a \u201cpause\u201d by the\nFed, an end to the ChinaAmerica trade war and a\npickup in the eurozone\neconomy. The first looks\nlike it\u2019s on the horizon.\nJerome Powell, chairman\nof the Federal Reserve,\nhinted at the beginning of\nthe new year that it might\npostpone any further\nrate hikes. Furthermore,\nwhilst interest rates in\nAmerica may not rise\ndispersed trade tensions,\nstimulating private sector\nspending. Consequently,\nthis stirs other Asian\neconomies which will\nincrease activity in the\neuro zone, which relies\nheavily on emerging\nmarket demand. Hence\nbond yields rise in the\nexpectation that interest\nrates will increase, making\nUS debt less favourable,\nas spreads between US\nand Euro bonds decrease,\ncausing the dollar to drift\ndown against the Euro.\nEvidence of this has been\nseen in recent turbulent\nmarkets, causing strain\non the American fixed\nincome front. JPMorgan\nrecorded a sharp fall in\nbond and currency trading\nrevenue as CEO Jamie\nDimon warned that US\ngovernment shutdown is\ncreating more challenges\nby bringing the economy\nto a standstill. However,\nthis scenario also suggests\na softish Brexit boosting\nthe pound, causing\na capital influx into\nemerging markets in the\nsearch of higher returns.\nHowever, after Tuesday\u2019s\nvote, the probability of\nthis remains uncertain as\nit sunk the pound to a six\nsession low of $1.2668.\nThe second scenario,\nthe trade dispute between\nChina and America\nescalates. This continued\nuncertainty means China\u2019s\ntax cuts are saved rather\nthan spent. Weakness in\nChina\u2019s economy brings\ndown other emerging\neconomies. Evidence of\nthis can be seen in the\nfact that export orders\nfor the large trading as\nwell as manufacturing\neconomies of Asia and\nEurope are signalling a\ntrade recession. Europe\nhas been suffering from\ndeclining demand in\nChina, the primary\ndrivers being policy and\nregulatory efforts to rein\nin the economies credit\nindependence, as China\u2019s\neconomy gets to grip\nwith underperformance\nof domestically oriented\nChinese equities. A rise\nin emerging markets risk\nassets would only happen\nif there was a reversal of\nthe Chinese protectionist\nrhetoric. Since this\nremains improbable\nand would indicate that\nthe stuttering eurozone\neconomy is not temporary\nthey are still higher than\nin Japan or the Eurozone,\nmaking owning the dollar\nmore rewarding. Will this\nchange in 2019? Many see\nthe path of the new year\nlaid out by two scenarios.\nThe first entails tax cuts\nand looser monetary\npolicy in China, caused by\nWill the dollar determine markets in 2019?\nbut a reflection of weak\nexport demand, there\nwould likely be a sell off\nof risk assets across the\nboard. Consequently, the\ndollar falls sharply against\nthe yen and swiss franc\n(euro remains weak).\nInvestors rush towards\nsafe-harbour currencies,\nas JPMorgan strategists\nadvise clients to take\nsome insurance, leading\nto a surge in the price of\ngold. Goldman Sachs now\nexpects the price of gold\nto rise to $1,425 over the\nnext year. \u201cTo take a view\non gold, you have to first\ntake a view on broader\nmarkets\u201d, said Tom Holl,\nBlackRock portfolio\nmanager. He added, \u201cIf we\ncontinue to see elevated\nlevels of macroeconomic\nuncertainty and risk\nadversity, then gold will\nprobably continue its\npositive momentum\u201d.\nJPMorgan recirded heavy losses in its bond and currency trading amid hieghtened volatilty//Brookings Institution\n\u201cto grip\nwith under\nperformance\nof domestically\noriented\nChinese\nequities \u201d\n\u201ctax cuts\nand looser\nmonetary\npolicy in\nChina, caused\nby dispersed\ntrade tensions,\nstimulating\nprivate sector\nspending\u201d\n\n"

They\ngave analogies related to\nfootball and F1 and things\nthat you could understand\nhow, in the \u201870s that\u2019s\nwhat you would accept\nfrom a Business school\nbut, in this day and age,\nit wasn\u2019t good enough.\nThey received a lot of\ncomplaints.\u201d\n\u201cI know that,\non reflection,\nthey have\nrealised that\nwas a mistake\u201d\nImperial Business\nSchool carry their \u201celite\nstatus\u201d with pride and\nmarket themselves as one\nof the world\u2019s leading\nuniversities. In Amy\u2019s\nopinion, Imperial Business School still has a lot\nto work on before being\nworthy of its \u201celite status\u201d\nin the world.\n\u201cThere are of course\nsome faculty members\nwho you see are trying, or\nhave found themselves in\nan environment that isn\u2019t\nrepresentative of how\nthey\u2019d do things but the\nvast majority of staff, and\nmaterials are not where\nthey should be for an elite\nschool.\u201d\nAccording to Amy, she\nand many of the students\nin the cohort were just\nlearning off YouTube,\nwhich begs the question,\n\u201chow can the Business\nSchool justify the cost\nof its Global MBA programme?\u201d\nAmy said: \u201cThey\nwanted you to pay your\nmoney, take what you\u2019re\ngiven. For a lot of stu-dents, it was because they\njust wanted the Imperial\nname, they just wanted the\ncertificate and this is part\nof the problem. This was\nalso part of the tension\nwithin the cohort. The\nvast majority of people\nwere doing it because\nof Imperial\u2019s reputation.\nThey didn\u2019t really care\nso much about the quality\nof what we were being\ntaught.\u201d Other students\nin the cohort have tried to\ndefend this in ways which\nAmy considers \u201cselfish,\nmisguided and unethical,\nincluding arguing that,\n\u201cpaying a lot for a course\nmeans that you should\nwork hard, even if this\nmeans teaching yourself\nor struggling through\nmaterials because of poor\nadministration or teaching.\u201d\nFor Amy, the whole\nreason that she chose\nImperial was because\nshe thought it \u201cimplied\nquality\u201d: \u201cI thought that\nI\u2019d be getting a high\nquality of teaching, a\nhigh quality of integrity,\nwhen in reality, it\u2019s all\njust brand, it\u2019s all just\nrepresentation. That\u2019s\nall I feel the majority of\nthe staff at the Business\nSchool really care about.\nThey don\u2019t care about\nthe quality for quality\u2019s\nsake, they care about what\npeople think about them,\nwhich is not the same\u201d\nAmy found herself\nasking whether Imperial\nCollege is elite or elitist\nand whether the two\ncan be separated. \u201cIn an\nideal world, you\u2019d want\nintegrity and reputation to\ngo hand-in-hand but we\nall know that reputation\nand integrity, there\u2019s not\na direct parallel all the\ntime. There should be but\nthere isn\u2019t, especially with\norganisations and institutions that have been going\nfor many, many years if\nnot over centuries. It takes\na long time for reputations\nand brands to change, it\u2019s\nnot an overnight thing.\u201d\nAmy complains of\nproblems that she felt\n\u201cgave people who had\ncome into the course with\na certain level of privilege\neven more privilege over\nother people.\u201d\nAmy added: \u201cI come\nfrom the direct opposite\nto the privileged, elitist\nbubble that this course\nseemed to want to protect.\nAnd it's not something I\ncan stand for.\u201d\nFollowing the problems\nwith bullying and issues\nwith her syndicate group,\nAmy decided to contact\nthose in charge of the\ncourse. However, she ran\ninto countless difficulties.\nShe grew frustrated with\nthe continued inaction on\nthe part of the Business\nSchool. Within the first\ntwo months Amy sent 12\ne-mails, to which she received no response. Amy\nrecounted: \u201cI was telling\nthem I was in a lot of\nemotional distress, please\ndon\u2019t ignore this email. It\nwasn\u2019t just casual stuff,\nit was \u2018I\u2019m hitting crisis\npoint, please help!\u2019\u201d\nIt got to the point where\nAmy then had to escalate\nit to the Dean of the\nBusiness School because\nshe was still receiving\nno response. When they\ndid finally respond, I had\na Skype call with the\nCourse director.\n\u201cI think generally\nspeaking, all the way\nthrough I was having a\nlot of problems with them\nand they just didn\u2019t help\nme. They knew that I was\nsuffering and, in many\nways, they just made it\na lot worse. They were\nfully aware that was being\nbullied and did nothing to\nstop it.\u201d\nTwo weeks into the\nsecond term, the stress\nbuilt again because \u201cthe\nquality of the teaching\nmaterials was just so poor\nagain\u201d. The course took\nits toll on Amy and left\nher really ill:\n\u201cBy that point I was\nreally suicidal and just\nreally depressed and my\npartner and I decided\nthat a major source of\ndistress was this course.\nThere was nothing more\nthat I could do, it wasn\u2019t\ngoing to get any better.\nI wasn\u2019t in a position to\naccept the poor quality,\nI felt that I hadn\u2019t been\ntreated fairly, I felt that\nmy reputation within the\ncohort had been damaged\nand also, it got to a point\nwhere I felt my integrity\nwas being compromised.\nI didn\u2019t want to be associated with the course and\nI didn\u2019t want to propagate\nthis elitist mentality of 'it\ndoesn\u2019t matter about the\nquality of the course, of\nthe teaching etc., it\u2019s all\nabout the name and the\nbrand and the reputation\nand what people think of\nit outside'\u201d.\nAmy is still dealing\nwith the ramifications of\nthe ordeal she suffered\nthrough. When speaking\nto Felix, she mentioned\n\u201cI\u2019ve only today just got\na psychiatrist say that I\u2019m\nactually now better. It\u2019s\ntaken all this time for the\ndepression to go away and\nthat\u2019s with medication,\ntherapy, everything and I\nhad to take three months\noff work because of it\naswell so it\u2019s not inconsequential to me\u201d.\nWhen approached\nfor comment, Professor\nFrancisco Veloso, Dean of\nImperial College Business\nSchool, said: \u201cWe are\ncommitted to providing\nall students with a world-class educational experi-ence, and want everyone\nin our diverse and global\ncommunity to feel supported and respected.\nIt would not be appropriate for us to comment\non specific matters\nrelating to an individual\u2019s\ncomplaint. However\nwe deeply regret if any\nstudent has had a negative\nexperience or did not\nreceive the support they\nexpected, and we always\nseek to learn and improve.\nWe welcome feedback\nfrom students, and are\nalways looking at ways\nwe can enhance our pro-grammes, currently with a\nparticular focus on student\nexperience. Our students\nare instrumental to our\naim of innovating, and\ntheir insights have driven\nmany of the changes\nbeing introduced to our\nprogrammes. Any students who would like to\nshare further suggestions\nor concerns are always\nwelcome to contact me.\nWe are very proud of\nour student body, and\nlook forward to continuing to work with them to\nmaintain and develop our\ncommunity.\u201d\nAfter self-researching\nand having to fight alone,\nAmy followed the official\ncomplaint procedures\nafforded to her, which\ntook six months. Whilst\nher complaints were all\nsubstantiated, she was left\n\u201cprofoundly disappointed\nby the contrition, empathy\nand humanity shown by\nthe Business School\u201d.\nAmy recently published\nan article on LinkedIn,\ntitled, \"2018, My Year of\nHell, Thanks to Imperial\nCollege Business School's\nOnline Global MBA\". In\nthis article, Amy gives\na full account, detailing\nher version of events.\nShe added: \u201cI do want\nto be categorically clear\nthat this is not just my\nstory. A lot of the things I\nwas affected by, affected\nother students too. I know\nother students who have\nsuffered on this course too\nand didn't get the support\nthey needed. Some even\nwithdrew too- just more\nquietly than me!\u201d\n\n"

These\nchanges can alter how\ncertain regions of DNA\nare read and copied, so\naffect the activity of key\ngenes.\n\u201cOur study shows\ncompelling evidence that\nchanges in epigenetic\nmarkers may persist over\nthe lifetime of an individual,\u201d said Professor\nMarjo-Riitta Jarvelin,\nfrom Imperial\u2019s School of\nPublic Health, and who\nled the research group.\nSmoking during pregnancy can lead to premature birth and low birth\nweight, as well as predisposing the child to higher\nrisk for cardio-metabolic\nrisk factors in later life.\nBut the exact mechanisms underlying these\nlonger-term effects were\nunclear.\nYet despite the known\nrisks, it is estimated 53%\nof women who smoke\ndaily continue to smoke\nduring pregnancy.\nProfessor Jarvelin\nadded: \u201cThese findings\nare important for health\npolicy makers to further\ndraw attention towards\nincreasing awareness\non smoking cessation\nprograms and for better\nprevention strategies in\nmaternity clinics and\nhealth centres.\u201d\nHer team focused on\nmethylation of a gene\ncalled GFI1, known to be\nlinked with smoking.\nUsing data from 22\npopulation-based studies\nfrom Europe, the US\nand Australia, the team\nlooked at the link between\nmaternal smoking and\nepigenetic changes in a\nnumber of regions of the\ngene.\nThey identified lower\nDNA methylation of GFI1\nin those who smoked or\nwhose mother smoked\nwhile they were pregnant.\nrange of health conditions\nin adulthood, including\ndiabetes, heart disease and\nstroke.\nPriyanka Parmar from\nthe University of Oulu,\nsaid: \u201cSuch epigenetic\nloci might serve as objective biomarkers of past\nenvironmental exposures\nthat could be used for preventive health measures.\nThis discovery provides\na strong foundation for\nfurther work to unravel\nemerging smoking\nepigenetic markers with\ndownstream detrimental\nhealth outcomes.\u201d\nCigarette smoking\naccounts for an estimated\nsix million deaths each\nyear and even former\nsmokers are at long-term\nrisk of cardiovascular\ndiseases, lung cancer and\nstroke.\nThe study highlights\nan underlying epigenetic\ncomponent for maternal\nsmoking exposure and\ndisease risk. But the size\nof the effect is unclear.\nThe team now\nhopes to explore more\ngenetic regions linked\nwith maternal smoking\nexposure and disease risk.\nTheir work focused on\njust six genetic markers\nout of a potential 6,000.\nPregnant woman smoking outside London hospital // Wikimedia\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 18TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\n\u201cThe study\nserves as\na caution\nfor mother\nsmokers,\nmore than\nhalf of whom\ncontinue\nduring\npregnancy\u201d\nKnown as \u2018epigenetic\ntags\u2019 these changes can\nlead to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and\ncancer.\nThe study, led by scientists at Imperial College\nLondon and the University of Oulu in Finland,\nanalysed data from more\nthan 18,000 people across\nthe world \u2013 including the\nUK, US and Australia.\nTheir findings published in the Lancet\u2019s\njournal EBioMedicine\n\u201cSmoking\nduring\npregnancy\ncan lead to\npremature\nbirth and low\nbirth weight\u201d\n\u201cExposure\nto cigarette\nsmoking in\nthe womb\nultimately\nincreases a\nperson\u2019s risk\nfor a range\nof health\nconditions in\nadulthood\u201d\nAccording to the\nresearchers, these epigenetic changes are associated with increased body\nmass index (BMI), blood\npressure and blood lipids\nlevels in adulthood.\nThis means exposure to\ncigarette smoking in the\nwomb ultimately increases a person\u2019s risk for a\n\n"

Sometimes this\nis down to airbrushing\nand photo-editing, but\nsometimes this can be\nbecause the celebrity has\nhad a cosmetic treatment,\nsuch as botulinum toxin\ninjection.\nBotulinum toxin works\nby disrupting the normal\nrelease of acetylcholine in\nmotor neurons, resulting\nin a temporary flaccid\nmuscle paralysis. Normal\nrelease of acetylcholine\nat the neuromuscular\njunction is mediated by a\nsynaptic fusion complex,\nwhich is made up of a\nset of proteins known as\nSNARE proteins. After\nmembrane fusion, acetylcholine is released into\nthe synaptic cleft and then\nbound by receptors on the\nmuscle cell. Botulinum\ntoxin cleaves the SNARE\nproteins, disrupting the\nassembly of the synaptic\nfusion complex, and\nthereby blocking achetyl-choline release.\nSeveral clinical trials\nhave been conducted\non botulinum toxin for\naesthetic use, mainly for\nfrown lines and crow\u2019s\nfeet. Botulinum toxin\nis also used for lateral\neyebrow lifts, \u2018bunny\nlines\u2019, and \u2018gummy\nsmile\u2019, among others.\nMuch of the safe use of\nbotulinum toxin is based\non the physician\u2019s injection technique, which is\noften personal and based\non clinical experience\nBotox injections result in temporary flaccid muscle paralysis // Flickr\nSeveral clinical trials have\nbeen conducted on botox\n// Flickr\n\u2013 incorrect injection technique can cause problems\nsuch as eyelid ptosis (a\ndrooping eyelid).\nBotulinum toxin has\nmedical and therapeutic\nuses outside of aesthetics,\nincluding muscle spas-ticity, strabismus, and\nimproper eye alignment.\nMany types and brands\nof botulinum toxin are\nnow available in several\ncountries worldwide.\nPeople have a range of\npsychological, cultural\nand social reasons for\nchoosing botulinum toxin\nas an aesthetic treatment,\nin our increasingly im-age-conscious world.\n\u201cIncorrect\ninjection\ntechnique\ncan cause\nproblems such\nas eyelid ptosis\n(a drooping\neyelid)\u201d\nWith more than 3.5 million botulinum toxin procedures worldwide in 2014, the global botulinum toxin market is\ncurrently worth \u00a33 billion and is expected to grow 7.2% each year\n\n"
