    "content": "Gene Loves Jezebel\n-Tangled Up In You 12\"\nGene Loves Jezebel continue their quest\nfor chart success. In desperation, this\nrelease contains one track from each of\ntheir latest four LPs, but not necessarily\nthe best (these were released years ago).\nThe last ditch advert even goes so far as\nto include a complete album photo\ndiscography in the gate fold. The title track actually sounds good. All the ingredients of chart success are there,\nbig sound, happy tune, happy lyrics,\nnothing devastating ly beautiful. The catch\nis Jay's voice which will only ever be\nsuited to his effected experiments, but\nblight this tuneful attempt. The dead\nending should throw a few DJs but it\ncould chart if it receives enough airplay.\nAs the record whines on, the band\nWorld of Twist\nI expected a dod gy Manchester band and\nI got it. Even the catalogue of visual\neffects, which luckily concealed the Shaun\nRyder lookalike, could not make such\ninsipid music interesting.\nThank God for a support act with a degree of originality. The first song began\nwith a never-ending mesh of sampled\nnoise and ended with a wave of feedback\nwhich left flares quaking in its wake. The\nrest of the set consisted of a series of\nbursts of distorted, heavily flange d wah-Dickless\nA somewhat strange record with an apt\nname for the, dare 1 say, fox core, band. I would presume that this is their first\nrelease of the OK's Glitterhouse label\n\u2014Subterrania\nwah guitar washing over the bass and\ndrums. The vocals were magnificent.\nAlthough soft they were clearly audible\nover the backing noise. Dr Phibes kicked\nbutt. Unfortunately whatever they were\non was not generally distributed to the\nassembled, flared, fans and their\nmagnificence seemed to pass well over\ntheir heads.\nThe rest of it\u2014see Dr Phibes avoid the\nManchester clones like the plague.\nSeb.\nwind further back into their persistent if\nnot progressive past. In fact it only leads\nto wondering whether the band have\nrather regressed. Suspicion and Heartache\nboth are more typical, more daring and\nreminiscent of U2's Unforgettable Fire era\nbut with more to it. Then, to totally\ncontradict me, the last and earliest track\nhere is the worst of the lot, dod gy vocals,\ndod gy backing, dod gy track. Sorry,\nStephen.\nThe odd choice of tracks just prove that\nsome things don't change. If you are a fan of Gene Loves Jezebel you will\nalready own the four offerings here. If\nyou are not, this will not convert you, but\nit may well earn the band a few more\npennies.\nSJH\nThe Big Dish\n\u2014Miss America 12\"\n-I'm a Man 12\"\n(licenced from Sub Pop USA). It coincides\nwith the recent vinyl debut of L7 and\nsubsequent UK tour. Similarities may be\ndrawn with another bands, The\nLunachicks, who are however at the\nother extreme.\nThe best comparison is perhaps Pussy\nGalores' bastard child, Boss Hog. The\nsame bass orientated drawling amble\nthrough the clich ed realms of scum rock dominate and a voice that defies the\nname Dickless. Despite all these assets\nthe music is one dimensional, showing\nlittle initiative. It seems the tried and\ntested Sub Pop formula is being used\nagain. The B side is remarkably similar to\nTad's God's Balls\u2014some achievement\nconsidering the difference in vocalists.\nUnfortunately it sounds like Sub Pop, a little heavier than the Sub Pop of old but\nstill the same old rock 'n' roll.\nSeb.\nSide one, the title track, sounds like the\nneedle stuck. The same line is repeated\nten times, then a different one, then off\nthey go again!. The result, eight minutes\nof reasonableness that needed a little\nmore energy to convert the monotony\ninto music. This is a case of a single\nbeing stretched to a12\" that should have\nremained at seven.\nSide two definitely has more substance\nand the needed energy. Both 'The\nMission Bell to the Deep Blue Sea' and\n'The Town Celebrity' hold your interest in\na way that 'Miss America' fails. This is a style of music that, in general, I like.\nMale vocals su ported by a traditional\ndrums and guitars set up and so thay\nwould have to be very bad for me not to\nlike them - which they're not.\nA good effort, hopefully the\nforthcoming album will contain something\na little more exciting - keep trying.\nIGH\n12\n\n"

    "content": "|\u00a3 Maggie Opens Centre\nOn Wednesday, Mrs Thatcher opened the\nnew Centre for Population Biology at\nSilwood Park. Although this was her first\nofficial engagement since her resignation,\nshe was in arum bus tio us mood, saying:\n'they want you to be in the photograph,\ncome along Eric' to Sir Eric Ash, the\nRector. Her first attempt to reveal the\nplaque failed; she said 'it's quite\nguesswork as to whether you pull the\nshort one or the long one,' referring to\nthe curtain pull-chords.\nThe visit of Mrs Thatcher to Silwood\nwas a high security operation\u2014even\nFELIX were not allowed to be present\u2014\nand her identity was kept a close secret\nill \u2022\nin view of possible terrorist action. STOIC\n(Student Television of Imperial College)\nwere the only camera crew allowed in\nthe building to perform a live relay to\nanother part of the building\u2014exclusive\nfootage this lunchtime at 1.00pm. The new centre, funded by the National\nEnvironment Research Council, was\nconstructed at the cost of \u00a32 million. The\nprime feature of the centre is the\nEcotron, a series of chambers in which\npopulations of insects and plants are\nhoused, forming small and totally isolated\necosystems. This enables the gap between\nthe real world and computer models to\nbe bridged, by reducing the variety of\nanimal-plant interactions to a more\nmanageable level.\nThese chambers can also be used to\nexamine the effect of environmental\nchanges since all factors, such as\ntemperature and daylight hours are under\nthe control of the experimenter rather\nthan nature. The simulation of\nenvironmental change on a small scale\nshould give rise to new insights into the\ncomplex interactions between plants and\nanimals.\nThe scientists at the centre hope to\ndevelop a more predictive science of\npopulation biology, with the ultimate aim\nof applying such knowledge to the\nmanagement of the environment. Spinoffs include results for scientists interested\nin closed-environment life support\nsystems which have applications in space\nand underwater technologies. This is\nbecause the Ecotron operates with\nre circulated and filtered air flow,\nreturning up to 98% of the air to the\nchambers on each cycle.\nEvacuation By-Law Union Lift\nPlans Change Stays Down\nCollege have announced an update to\ncontingency plans to deal with the\nevacuation of the College site. If the\nwhole college is to be cleared, a siren\nwill sound from the top of the Queen's Tower. Simultaneously fire alarms will\nsound in all departments.\nUnder the direction of emergency\nservices, students and staff are asked to\nmove Eastwards towards Prince's Gardens, assembling outside the Health\nCentre.\nAll exits onto Queensgate will either be\nmanned or will be locked and it will not\nbe possible to remove cars from the\nSherfield car park.\nNo more Union cards will be issued to\nresearch assistants until the By-Laws are\nchanged, Paul Shanley, Union President,\nhas announced.\nAlthough some cards have been\nreleased, the By-Laws do not currently\nallow the issue of cards to research\nassistants. A motion will be put at the\nnext Union General Meeting (UGM) to\nchange the situation.\nTo be approved, the motion must pass\ntwo UGMs and must be approved by the\nGoverning Body. The first U GM will be\non Thursday 17th January.\n)\nThe Union building lift will be out of\nservice until late March. The lift, which is\nsituated in the building's foyer, is used by\nboth DramSoc and STOIC for moving\nheavy equipment and has been out of\norder since early last term when a component unexpectedly sheared.\nThe delay is due to the time taken\nstress-testing the remaining parts and\nreplacing any deemed unsafe. Benjamin\nTurner, Deputy President, said that the\nlift should be serviced once every year\nbut added that he had 'no idea when it\nwas last serviced'. He has apologised on\nbehalf of the Union to the clubs\nconcerned.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "The persistent Pinky and Perky eventually interview..\nThe Wedding Present MUSIC\n'All of a sudden I 've had loads of\ninterviews to do\u2014how long have you\nbeen waiting then?' Well it had been for\nover four hours, but never mind, we\nfinally had an audience with His Royal\nHighness of indie pop; Mr David Gedge.\nFor those few who don't know, The\nWedding Present hail from Leeds (sort of),\nand are David Gedge (guitar/vocals);\nPeter Solowka (guitar), Keith Gregory\n(bass) and Simon Smith (drums). So how\ndid they form? 'Well I 've known Peter for\nyears and years\u2014I went to school with\nhim. Actually I 've probably known him\nfor too long. I 've always been in bands\nand when I finally got to University we\ndecided to try and make a career out of\nit'. At this time David was studying Maths\nat Leeds, while Peter was in Liverpool.\n'So I put an advert in the college union,\nand we got Keith, and our first drummer\nShaun\u2014put out a single' (Go out and get\n'em boy!) 'and we've never looked back\nsince.' In the early days 'Peter was a supply teacher, but the rest of us were on\nthe dole, except Shaun who was still a student (he was a year younger than us)'.\nShaun on drums eventually left 'because\nwe asked him to' and was replaced by\nthe present drummer Simon. 'It's just, for\nme anyway, it's really important that you\nget on with everyone in the band, and in\nthe end he was quite difficult to get on\nwith. You hear stories about the Sex\nPistols all hating each other, and then\nmaking brilliant records, but I couldn't do\nthat.'\nTheir early work\u2014the LP's George Best\nand Tommy\u2014and numerous singles were\nreleased on their own label Reception\nRecords. The band waited several years\nbefore signing to a major record label, in\nspite of several lucrative offers as they\nsought complete artistic independence\nand control. They finally got this with\nRCA 'to their credit' and have since\nreleased an LP Bizarro and the singles\nBrassneck (along with an infamous TO TP appearance) and Corduroy. The band\nformed over five years ago but Gedge is\nstill enthusiastic about writing and\nperforming\u2014'I don't think I'd be doing it\nunless I was, it's not something I can\nmanufacture. I can't sit down and say\nright I 've got to write a song, it's not like\ndoing a mathematical problem' (we never\nimagined it was!). He claims that he is not\nhappy with their work to day, as looking\nback George Best is a bit disappointing,\nand something like Tommy, which is a compilation of all the old singles is fairly\nun listenable. For me, there's always lyrics\nthat stick out as slightly embarrassing,\nand the sound is a bit cheap.' He believes\nhis writing and singing have improved\nover the years 'and now we're much better at producing records'. In 1988 The\nWeddoes released a session of Ukranian\nfolk music, which was somewhat distant\nfrom their own musically distinctive style\n(but was still excellent). The guitarist\nPeter Solowka, who is half Ukranian can\nbe held solely responsible, but the rest of\nthe band really enjoyed making the\nalbum, and do not regret that particular\nventure. 'Peter would probably have done\nit anyway', with or without the other\nband members.\nThe band's influences 'change all the\ntime. Each of us have our own musical\ntastes, but it's guitar bands really'. Gedge\ninsists that the band work together as a team, with each member having their\nown role, although he writes all the\nsongs. 'If I write ten songs, the rest of the\nband will hear about seven, and then\nmaybe five will be committed to record.'\n'We vote on all important issues such as\nsigning record deals\u2014we've got a very\ncomplicated voting system\u2014we're quite\ndemocratic really.'\nAnd his views on the current music\nscene: 'Well, it's alright, but it's not my favourite, although I quite like the\nManchester scene.' (Gedge a BAGGY??)\n'From a musical point of view I'm all in\nfavour of music changing.'\nThe Wedding Present are currently in\nthe process of getting enough material\ntogether for a new LP 'which will\nprobably be recorded early next year,\nand I imagine it will be out by Spring'.\nFinally, we had to ask whether he had\nseen George Best's notorious Wogan\nappearance, since the band had named\none of their albums after him.\nWell: 'No, I wish I had, loads of people\nhave asked me about it.'\nPinky and Perky.\n\n"

This is the first issue of the year,\nmy first issue as Ed, and thus the first set\nof mistakes for which I have to take the\nblame. It's also the first year of the new\ndecade, and so what does '91 hold in\nstore?\nWar\nYep, the prospect of Saddam 'jolly sane\nreally and we believe that don't we?'\nHussein actually pulling out of Kuwait\nseems about as likely as Sir Eric Ash saying 'Extend the college day? Nah, I was only joking'. So, despite President\nBush's 'hard line' (ie 'pull out by ... or I 'll\nissue another ultimatum'), it seems that\non January 15th things are going to start\nto get nasty. Although what exactly the\naforementioned perfect example of\nreasoning behaviour (Hussein, not Bush)\nhopes to achieve by the deaths of\nthousands of people in a war he has no\nchance of winning isn't exactly clear to\nme. Anybody want to let me in on the\nsecret?\nCollege Day\nThe working party (possibly one of the\nmost ironic names for a committee I 've\never heard) has been ominously silent for\nquite a while now. It's tempting to think\nthat maybe the resounding 'f**k off\ngiven to them in the referendum held\nbefore ch rim bohol s has halted them in\ntheir tracks.

    "content": "Scribblers' Corner Zymurgy\nLETTERS\nDear Andy,\nI would like to point out that my name\nis actually El-Kholy, not El-Choly,\nhowever, considering the length of reply\nto At h,I am in no position to complain\nabout a minor typo. This is a much\nshorter reply, and hopefully one which\nwould spare me the effort of having to\naddress people like Ultan McCarthy once\nand for all.\nFirst, in reply to A th,1 was glad to see\nthat Ath's letter contained something like\nan attempt to address the issue without\nthe usual inflammatory 'bigoted ranting s'. My first reaction, however was not to\nwaste time on a reply since the\narguments presented were so weak as to\ndemonstrate an almost total ignorance of\nthe situation in the Middle East. I don't think that A th had ever heard the name\nSaddam Hussein until August 2. Having\nfound out that A th are actually two\nneighbours of mine in Southside, I think\nmy initial judgement was totally justified.\nAs for Mr McCarthy, and for anyone\nelse who is hard of thinking, my reply\nwas tongue in cheek. I was merely trying\nto point out that any culture can be made\nto look 'immature' if judged from a biased\nperspective. Not once in my letter did I deny that Britain has a long history, and\na culture emulated the world over. I am\nnot so sure if the British culture is envied\nthe world over. There are people who\nrecognise the achievements of this culture\nas well as being able to point out its\nshortcomings. Let me also remind Mr\nMcCarthy, that American culture is widely\nadopted the world over, and that this\ndoes not mean that it is in any way\nsuperior, or for that matter envied.\nWhat Mr McCarthy seems to lack is the\nability to look at the history and culture\nof nations from a factual and objective\npoint of view, instead of his narrow,\nnationalistic and bigoted perspective.\nAs I have no intention of stooping so\nlow as to devote any more time to Mr\nMcCarthy, let me state once and for all,\nthat I am not a member of the Saddam\nHussein Fan Club, and neither are any of\nthe students who actually know anything\nabout the Middle East. More than anyone\nelse, we know the kind of repression\ninflicted by this man on the people of his\nown country. But there is more to life Mr\nMcCarthy than a stupid football match\nmetaphor, or fan clubs, of winning a losing a game. That is why, the people\nwho oppose the policy of the United\nStates and all other states who take the\nhigh moral ground only when convenient,\ncannot be referred to collectively, in the\nbest bigoted tradition of over-generalisation, as the Saddam Hussein\nFan Club. I hope you can understand me\nMr McCarthy, because, in case you have\nnot realised yet, you are no more than a minor irritation to people who are having\nto deal with a legacy of disruption,\ninstability and economical political chaos.\nA legacy to which people like yourself,\nwhen they had the power to do so, made\na major contribution. We have better\nthings to do than to answer your letters.\nYours sincerely,\nAmin El-Kholy, DoC PG.\nWhat' sOn AN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS\nIN AND AROUND IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nFRIDAY\nHang Gliding 12.30pm Southside Upper Lounge.

What concerns\nthe organisation are human rights\nviolations taking place in that context.\nThose violations which have been\nreported since August 2 1990 are entirely\nconsistent with abuses known to have\nbeen committed in Iraq over many years,\nand which have been documented by A I in its numerous reports. Iraq's policy of\nthe brutal suppression of all forms of\ninternal dissent continues to be\nimplemented, and the people of Iraq\nremain its victims. A I has repeatedly\nplaced such information on the public\nrecord, and regrets that until the invasion\nof Kuwait, the international community\ndid not see fit to apply serious pressure in\nan attempt to put an ft nd to these abuses.\nThe report has been compiled\nprincipally on the basis of interviews with\nsome 100 people who fled Kuwait\nbetween August and November 1990.\nThey were mostly interviewed in Saudi\nArabia, Bahrain and the UK. They\nincluded Bahrainis, Saudis, Lebanese,\nEgyptians, Palestinians, Indians, Filipinos,\nBritons and Americans as well as Kuwaiti\nnationals, former detainees, families and\nvictims of extra judicial executions and\nthose who have 'disappeared',\neyewitnesses and medical personnel.\nIt is impossible to estimate the numbers\narrested after the invasion. Kuwaiti\nsources estimate over 10,000 have been\ndetained\u2014a figure impossible to\nsubstantiate without further interrogation.\nThe report contains extensive\ninterviews with detainees who were\ntortured. Common to the testimonies of\nmost witnesses were reports that:\n1.

    "content": "Miami Blues\nAfter seeing a certain number of\nfilms you start to draw a few\nconclusions about various things.\nOne of mine is that films based on books\nare always a bit weird. Often they're very\nbad as well, especially if the director\ndecides to stick very closely to the\noriginal, instead of utilising the\nadvantages of film as a medium, and\nworking around the innate drawbacks.\nRight, enough of the pretentious film\ncritic (rave on). Miami blues is a film of a book of an idea that the writer (no doubt)\nonce had while sitting in front of his\nkeyboard and wondering what time the\npubs open. Or maybe not. Anyway, it is a bit weird.\nThe story follows the adventures of one\nFrederick j. Frenger, Jr. (Alec Baldwin),\nex-con, a newcomer to Miami, and a bit\nof a psychotic type as well. Once off the\nplane he breaks the finger of a pestering\nHari Krishna and walks off. The Krishna\npromptly drops dead from shock, which is\na bit unfortunate for Junior (and the\nKrishna, of course) as this sets Sergeant\nHoke Moseley (Fred Ward) on his trail.\nBy the way, where did they get these\nnames from?\nAnyway, Junior meets Susie Waggoner\n(Jennifer Jason Leigh, and I'm not joking\nabout the name..) and off we go on a sometimes funny, sometimes sad and\nsometimes shocking, but ultimately\ndoomed trip into unwilling Bonnie and\nvery willing Clyde country. With Junior\ngetting hold of a cops gun and badge and\nusing them to commit various criminal\ntype things\nOverall it's a hard film to review. It's very well done, quite amusing at points\nand Fred Ward is, as always, excellent.\nBut whether or not you should go and\nsee it really depends on your feelings\ntowards the slow but definite sense of\ninevitability that pervades the whole film.\nYou know what's going to happen a long\ntime before it does, and despite the\ntraditions of Hollywood it does happen.\nMm mm... Alien Sex Fiend\nThree Sisters\nThe Physics students have\ndeveloped a bad reputation at this\nCollege. To wit: they are 'square'\nand boring. This is perhaps only true for\n6 0 % of any given year, but it is still a significant proportion. Their grown-up\ncounterparts, the professors, are, with a few not i cable exceptions, little better.\nWhy then is one of the main characters\nin this film an attractive, woman ising and\nlikeable bastard of a Physics professor?\nIt is a question of conflicts, as is so\noften the case in 'relationship' movies.\nLife and science, man and woman, duty\nand desire struggle their way through the\nlives of the three sisters\u2014Sandra (Valeria\nGolino), an 18-year old medical student,\nVelia (Fanny Ardant) a lecturer and Maria\n(Greta Scacchi), bored wife of aTV Comedian\u2014as well as their artistically\nfrustrated brother Roberto (Sergio\nCastellitto). While the women are the\ncentral char actes, the men are not\nreduced to ciphers, but allowed full\ncharacters, if ones which seem inferior to\nthe women.\nThe film is handicapped by the twin\ndisadvantages of subtitles and slow\npacing, yet for those prepared to brave\nthese a good film awaits. Despite the\nlanguage barrier, the film avoids\naddressing culture specific problems,\ninstead relying on universal emotions and\nfears, a direction that was no doubt aided\nby the fact of its Italian-French-German\nco-production. Into this emotional swell\nwe are swept, with the concept of time\nslowly ebbing from the mind, as we come\nto care for the characters. Without doubt\na good, if not exceptional movie, and one\nthat is better than much of the\ncommercial dross foisted on us by\nHollywood.\nPendragon.\nFred Ward's got those Miami\nblues\nTexasville is one of those films that\ncries out to be described as 'warm,\naffectionate and witty' and while it's all of\nthese things, it's also more calibrated for\nthe American psycho-drama market than\nfor British audiences. All the characters\nare well-drawn and the plot (for want of\na better word) is entirely concerned with\ntheir various neuroses and love-lives.\nAll in all, a nice film with a fair amount\nof appeal but don't expect fast-moving\naction. A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nOne sister - one drink: Democracy The start of a tough day in\nin action Texasville\n\n"

In\nhospital, he has a dream in which God\ngives him a second chance as a 'probationary angel', helping the needy.\nSo off he goes, with an extremely bad\nhat, dressed like a character from TV's abysmal 'Highway to Heaven',\nun surprisingly enough.\nThings go from bad to worse. Every\none of the 'moral' points this film tries to\nput across is made to be either cringing ly sentimental or embarrassingly 'streetwise',\nand in both cases is restated again and\nagain, just in case we were thick enough\nnot to figure it out the first time.\n'Almost an Angel' is being marketed as\nThe Garden\nDerek Jarman is sitting at his desk,\nhis consciousness is fading, soon he\nis asleep and the camera is to drift\ninto the man's sub consciousness. The\nGarden is Jarman's dream scope( so\nbeware!). It is both Jarman's nightmare\nand Jarman's wet dream.\nThe Garden is a reinterpretation of\nChrist's life. Here he is represented by\ntwo homosexual men who are arrested,\npersecuted, humiliated, tortured then\nmurdered by brutal policemen dressed in\nSanta suits. There is also the depiction of\nthe Virgin Mary and child who is\nhounded by and virtually 'raped' by the\nvoyeurism of three balaclava d photographers kit ted complete with\nphallic zoom lenses.\nThere are hardly any spoken words in\nthe film, but the images are so striking\nthat words would be superfluous in this\na comedy, but I'd love to know why.\nWhat few humorous moments exist are\nruined by bad timing and direction, even\nif they weren't tragically unfunny in the\nfirst place. The entire film relies on\nHogan's earlier success as Crocodile\nDundee - it certainly has little or no\nappeal of its own.\nTo be fair, the film does keep you\nguessing about Hogan's angelic ness right\nto the very end. But what an end: The\nmorsels of suspense that make it through\nthe constant barrage of sad and futile\nbible-thumping disintegrate in a closing\nscene which is, quite frankly, bollocks.\nSo, to sum up, 'Almost an Angel' is a bad film. It sucks. Hard.\nM LE Bumps It.\nfilm. Jarman filmed in Super 8 originally\nand then transferred the print to video.\n(The picture thus acquires the right\n'experimental' quality which is essential\nfor the work of any radical film-maker.)\nThe Garden is harder than many of\nJarman's other films (for example Jubilee,\nThe Tempest or Caravaggio) probably\nbecause Jarman feels he is making more\nand more for himself rather than people\n(he claims to be the only real\nindependent film-maker of his generation!\nHe also said 'The Garden extends cinema\nin a way that is absolutely\nextraordinary'). I suppose artistic integrity\ncomes more easily if you know you won't be making many more films (Jarman is\nHIV-positive).\nGo see The Garden if you want to be\nchallenged.\nI.H. Arachnophobia\nYes.it is about spiders, and yes,\nthey are nasty ones. It starts in\ngreat 'B movie' style with an\nexpedition to a remote part of the\nVenezualian rainforest that has been cut\noff from the outside world for thousands\nof... Yes, well, you get the idea. The\nupshot of this is that one of the\naforementioned nasty spiders get back to\nthe good ol' USA, the land of opportunity\n(at least, apparently, for spiders). It ends\nup in a lazy little rustic town, the new\nhome of a big city doctor (Jeff Daniels)\nand his family, who have moved away\nfrom the stress of the big city. From this\npoint on everything goes wrong for\nDaniels (who, surprisingly enough, has an\nacute case of the aforementioned phobia),\nand right for the spiders (well, at least\nuntil the end of the movie). Several\ndeaths ensue, the last being that of the\nbaddies (ie the spiders).\nThe secret to enjoying this movie (and\nit is enjoyable) is to suspend your\ndisbelief. Scientifically (sorry) speaking, it\nsucks. It really is very silly. The spiders\nhave a hive based biology, which is silly,\nand are jolly intelligent, which is very\nsilly. However, the film is very good. It\nmanages to maintain a Hitchcockian\ntension, interspersed with some very\nfunny bits, mainly supplied by John\nGoodman (the husband in TV's Rosanne)\nwho plays the role of the town's pest\nexterminator. The end result is something\nof a rollercoaster ride of horror and\nhumour, well worth the effort.

    "content": "Douglas Makhija ponders the future of our public transport.\nTrains! I often find myself assessing the true\nworth of my season ticket while\ncommuting daily to and from College\nthrough mostly subterranean channels.\nThree factors carry the most weight in\nmy assessment: the comfort of the ride\non the system, the speed at which Iam conveyed to my destination and the ease\nof changing between modes of transport\n(when the need arises). It is clear that\nwhat, in my view at least, is the ultimate\nsolution to the problems caused by the\ninherent imperfections of the concept of\nof public transport (that can be easily\nperceived by any old twit who travels on\nthe tube in the rush hour) would require\ninfrastructure changes so radical that it is\nunlikely that they would ever be\nimplemented.\nThe first area of public transport that\ncould be approached (and, in fact, is\nbeing approached\u2014albeit at a very\nleisurely pace in the United Kingdom) is\nthat of the comfort of ride on the mode\nof transport in question. In the case of\nthe bus, the Leyland Titan of 1977\nrepresented the major leap forward in\nperformance and ride, but the progress of\nthe bus is severely limited by the\ndimensional constraints imposed by road\nwidths and bridge clearances. Numerous\nimprovements can still be made to the\nhigh capacity rapid transit 'toothpaste\ntubes' that one has the daily pleasure of\nbeing squeezed into and out of, morning\nand evening. With modern semiconductor\ndevices being introduced into electric\ntraction packages, vehicle performance\nhas improved and better ride quality has\nresulted from efforts to save energy.\nInside the trains, problems caused by\nantisocial tendencies (similar to the classic\n'seats being taken on a bus' analogy that\nis often used to explain Pauli's exclusion\nprinciple) have been solved by removing\nmost of the seats for future designs of\ntrains. The estimates of packing density in\ngangway spaces have also been increased\nfrom 4 to 6 passengers standing, or rather\nsuffocating per square metre.\nIncreasing passenger capacity is not\nsufficient: the fact that the platforms of\nsome principal node stations on the\nLondon Underground network can fill up\nto 'genocide-on-the-track' point from\nvirtually empty within 90 seconds does\nimply that an increased frequency service\nis desperately needed. This means that\nmore trains are required which in turn\nimplies that more money is needed which\nmeans that unless the tube receives a generous donation of \u00a3500m from the\nIkimichinatsubishi Bank of Japan in\nreturn for some advert slots...basically,\nnot in my lifetime.\nTrains have to be closely spaced in\norder to derive full benefit from the\navailability of more rolling stock. The\nTransmission Based Signalling (or TBS)\nconcept has gained ground following the\nadvent of popular, inexpensive\nmicrocontrollers. The trains inform each\nother of their relative positions so, if one\ntrain brakes to a halt, a train directly\nbehind it will be informed of the velocity\nchange and consequently will\nprogressively brake to stop a fixed\ndistance behind the first unit. The system\nhas also found application in an automatic\nmotorway driving experiment conducted\nby Volkswagen in 1989: three cars were\nsuccessfully driven as a 'train' using lane\nmarkings as guide ways and, through the\nuse of radio inter communication, were\nable to sustain 80mph driving at distance\nof '/zm apart, without being physically\nconnected in any way.\nTransmission Based Signalling is finally\nbeing turned into reality in the UK: the\nDocklands Light Railway in East London\nis being re-equipped with a TBS signalling\nsystem to increase train frequency in time\nfor the opening of the Canary Wharf\nbusiness development. The Docklands\nLight Railway has demonstrated the\nability of light rail transit to adapt to a rapidly changing environment with ever-increasing usage. The success of the\nDocklands Light Railway has paved the\nway for other light rapid transit systems\nin the United Kingdom: the Manchester\nMetrolink, featuring street-running of\nsingle-deck light rail vehicles through the\ncity centre, is due to open later this year,\nand there are other systems planned for\nBirmingham, Sheffield and Bristol, to\nname but a few. Current trends seem to\nsuggest that privately financed light rail\ntransit will be dominant among new\ntransport projects in the UK, as well as\nworldwide, in this decade.\nThe final failing of the public transport\nsystem that I would like to dwell upon is\nthat of changing: between lines on the\ntube, between tube, train or bus, etc.\nThose of us who know what it is like to\nbe a 'Metro, Boulout, Dodo' zombie\nwould certainly like to see an end to\nhaving to change between different lines\non the tube: being trampled upon on the\nescalators and being pushed on the track\nin front of an approaching train while\nwaiting for it on a platform packed to\n'fire hazard' point. A simple solution\nwould be to connect the lines together at\nthe stations where they cross and to run\nthrough services between them. This\ncould be taken much further: to avoid\nunder-util is ation of large capacity\nvehicles, why not make them much\nsmaller, say with only four seats and no\nstrap hangers? Eventually, having finished\ncontemplating Autotaxis, one would reach\nthe ultimate goal of a unified standard\npersonal transport system, with a flexible\nTBS system being provided by an\nobservation satellite. All vehicles would\nbe automatically driven to the\ndestinations spec if ed by the user. They\nwould be capable of operating over\nrailway and standard roadway\ninfrastructures. With personalised\ntransport taking over on such an\nenormous scale, public transport would\ndie an instant death (however, this would\nnot necessarily mean mass-unemployment\nfor train staff: take computer scientists for\nexample; they claim that their job\nspecification is that of making themselves\nredundant, but the ascendancy of the\nincomprehensibly complex Unix operating\nsystem means that they are likely to have\ngainful employment for many years to\ncome).\nWould all this even be necessary? The\npopulation may all end up working from\nhome and the only item needing\ntransportation would be information. The\nworld may become full of couch-potatoes\nfirmly rooted in front of their television\nsets (if television is needed by that time).\nUltimately, the question may boil down\nto whether the industrialised world would\nlike to sit and rot, feeding itself on a stream of binary digits, or whether it\nwould prefer to take both the good and\nthe bad in life, having something better\nto look forward to, rather than dying a premature death of boredom, not to\nmention under-exercise.\nI have found that, despite having to\nendure daily suffocation, travelling on a public transport network forces one to\nacknowledge that other homo-sapiens are\nstill in existence (whatever the situation\nin the Gulf crisis may be). Public transport\nmay not appeal to the environment-unfriendly business executive, but it is\nstill of vital importance to us lesser\nmortals who are not granted parking\npermits in Central London. My hope is\nthat future governments will never\nneglect this vital service again, learning\nthe lessons arising from the excessive\nfrugality of the 1980s, the lessons of the\nworst cases that were previously assumed\nimprobable; the King's Cross fire of\nNovember 1987 is an example that\nforever lingers in my memory, especially\nsince 1 can remember riding on the\nsqueaking escalator, where the tragedy\nstarted, in the morning on the very day\nthat the fire occurred. It must always be\nremembered that nothing is impossible to\nirresponsibility: one hopes that the 31\ndeaths on that fateful evening were not in\nvain.\nINTERESTED?\nWatch the documentary on ' The Docklands Light Railway' at 1pm on Tuesday January 1 5 (Gulf war\npermitting) in the Union Snack Bar,\nJ CR and halls.\n14\n\n"

There followed a bloody civil war between Government\ntroops and armies of Samurai, in which the Samurai were utterly defeated;\nswords and arrows proved no match for\nbullets and grape shot. Japan's rush\ntowards economic and political reform\ncontinued faster than ever. The civil war\nhad created a lot of ill feeling towards\n'the old ways', and many people gave up\ntheir traditional way of life.\nWatching events unfold was a young\nprofessor, Jigoro Kano (1860-1938).\nAlthough a rather weak man physically,\nhe had studied several martial arts,\nincluding a version of ju-jitsu. The origins\nof ju-jitsu are unknown, lost in the mists\nof time. It is many centuries old, and was\nthe most brutal, violent and lethal form of\nunarmed combat in the world. Ju-jitsu\nwas one of the first things to be banned,\nand it was some years before a revised,\nless murderous version was reintroduced.\nOne of Kano's chief concerns was the\nteaching of physical education in\nJapanese schools, which he considered to\nbe greatly inferior to that taught in the\nWestern world. He wanted to introduce\nsomething traditional but acceptable, and\nin 1882 he invented Kodak an Judo.\nThe new 'combat sport' of judo\nincluded many techniques from various\nforms of ju-jitsu; techniques and skills\nwhich Kano feared might otherwise have\nbeen lost forever. To understand what\njudo really is we must look carefully at\nthe name.\nJu-do is made from two Japanese\nwords. 'Do' means way or path, such as\nin Aikido\u2014the way of Aiki \u2014 or kendo\u2014\nthe way of the sword (Japanese two-handed fencing). 'Ju' is more of a philosophical term than a physical\nquantity. It is a word taken from Taoist\nphilosophy, and is the opposite of 'ken'.\nKen means hard, extreme, unreasonable,\noffensive, while ju means soft, gentle,\npassive, defensive. Martial arts can\napproximately be classified as 'ken' styles\nor 'ju' styles. Ken styles include karate,\nkendo, bo-jitsu and some forms of kung\nfu, where the object is to overpower your\nopponent through speed and strength. Ju\nstyles include taekwondo, ju-jitsu, some\nstyles of nin-jitsu and judo, where the\niii ii in it i A powerful throw by Peter Swettenham, scoring ip pon. object is to exploit your o ppen ent's weaknesses. Ju does not mean weak\u2014no\njudo throw can be described as weak.\nRather, it calls for economical, efficient\nactions and movement. The weakness we\nlook for in judo is balance. If your\nopponent is even slightly off balance,\npressure in the correct direction will\nthrow him to the ground with hardly any\neffort on your account.\nBasically, judo is a style of wrestling.\nSome wrestling styles, like Greco Roman,\nare 'naked' styles: only allowing grips and\nholds on the body. There are belt styles\nlike Glima and Sumo, where grips are\nmade primarily on the belt; and there are\nfully clothed styles such as Sambo and\nJudo, which offer the greatest range of\ngrips. The object in Judo is to throw your\nopponent onto his back, or to im mobil is e him by holding him on the ground, or to\ngain a submission.\nWe will look at throws first. When Kano first started teaching judo at the\nKodokan in Tokyo he taught forty\nthrows, now known collectively as the\nGokyo. These were mostly ju-jitsu throws,\nsome carefully altered to suit the ideals of\njudo, and a few were brand new throws\ninvented by Kano. In the years since then\nsome of these throws have changed\nslightly, and a few new throws have been\ninvented. One such throw, yama-arashi,\nwas invented by a student of Kano. He\nbecame so devastating ly effective with it\nthat it was banned for several years until\nsomebody devised a manoeuvre to\ncounter it.\nSome of the throws in the Gokyo are\nextremely popular and widely use, others\nare rarely seen. Particular throws suit\ndifferent height or weight of people. All judo players (judoka) have to kui waz a, favorite techniques they are particularly\ngood at, but to be successful in fight and\ncompetitions you should know and\npractice as many different throws as\npossible. All the throws depend on the\nthrower (tori) getting the defender (uk e: literally 'the receiver') off balance for the\nsplit second necessary for a properly\nexecuted throw to work.\nThere are six main groups of throws,\nalthough a few throws do not fall under\nany particular category.\n1. Nage-waz a( throwing techniques). In\nn age techniques tori pulls uk e off balance\nin order to throw him. Uke is usually\nthrown forwards, over tori's body.\n2. Koshi-waz a( hip techniques). As in\nn age waz a, tori has turned to face the\nsame way as uk e. Tori squats slightly so\nhis hips are under uk e's. Tori then stands\nup, lifting uk e off the ground. (This is\nsurprisingly easy. My twelve year old\nbrother can lift my12 stones right off the\nground.) With uk e stuck a couple of feet\nup in the air, tori can easily throw him\nonto his back. As with n age waz a,uk e usually falls forwards.\n3. Gari-waz a( sweeping techniques). Uke\nis very unstable if he takes a step. Just as\nuk e's foot touches the mat, tori sweeps it\nin the same direction. We call this\n'extending the step' and it has the same\neffect as if uk e had slipped on ice. He is\nsuddenly completely off balance. Tori\npushes uk e, at right angles to his\ndirection of motion. Uke falls backwards\nor sideways.\n4) Gake-waz a( hooking techniques). In\nthe sweeping techniques tori's leg is\nstraight, whereas in hooking techniques it\nis bent in order to hook uk e's leg. This\nprovides more power, at the expense of\nmano ever ability. Gake throws are used in\na similar way to gari ones, when uk e is\nstationary.\n5. Sutemi-waz a( sacrifice techniques).\nThese are often affectionately described\nas suicide throws. Tori falls onto his back\nin order to pull uk e off balance and\nthrow him. If uk e is very quick he might\nescape from the throw and trap the\nprostrate tori on the ground, otherwise\nthere is virtually nothing he can do.\n6. Guruma-waz a( wheel techniques).\nMost guru maw aza are leg techniques;\nsimilar to gari-waz a except that tori's leg\nis stationary, provided a pivot over which he 'wheels' uk e. There are others, such as\nkata-guru ma( shoulder wheel). In kata-guru ma tori lifts uk e right into the air,\nover his shoulders, and throws him on\nthe other side.\nIf you manage to throw your opponent\nyou will get a score of 3, 5, 7 or 10\npoints, depending on how uk e lands. A ten point score (called ip pon) is an\nautomatic win, and the contest is ended,\nany other score is recorded by the\nscore keeper and the fight continues on\nthe ground.\nIn ground techniques (ne-waz a) you must hold uk e flat on his back, and you\nget a score of 3, 5, 7 or 10 points\ndependent on how long you hold him( for\n15, 20, 25 or 30 seconds respectively)\nbefore he escapes or you win. Two waz a ari (7 point scores) are equivalent to an\nip pon. This dates from early judo when\nip pon and waz a ari were the only scores\ngiven. Lower scores are only important if\nboth competitors have one or no\nwaz a ari.\nA very important part of groundwork is\ns hime waz a( strangle techniques) and\nkan set suwa za( arm lock techniques). The\nobjective of these is simple: to hurt your\nopponent so he submits. The range of\npermitted techniques is quite restricted, to\navoid injury to uk e. Wrist and shoulder\nlocks were never allowed, and leg locks\nwere eventually banned because they are\ntoo difficult to control safely. When strangling someone you may apply\npressure with your forearms or the neck\nof their jacket, but you cannot grab hold\nof the throat. There are ten basic\nstrangles and five basic arm locks. Locks\nand strangles may be applied while\nstanding, but these are difficult and\nextremely rare.\nJudo was an instant hit in Japan, and\naround the turn of the century\nenthusiastic judoka started to 'export'\njudo around the world, giving\ndemonstrations and exhibitions, but it\nspread slowly. The first judo school in\nEurope was the Budokwai in Chelsea,\nwhich still thrives and attracts senior\njudoka from all over Britain to training\nsessions. Its founder, Guni Koizumi(18851965), is typical of many judoka. As a boy he studied ken-jutsu, but found it\ndistasteful and switched to ju-jitsu. Much\nlater he joined the Kod ok an \u00ab nd fell in\nlove with judo. After settling in England\nhe opened the Budokwai (then) Royal\nAcademy, who eventually set up their\nown dojo. Imperial College Judo Club is\nthus the second oldest in the country.\nJudo became an Olympic sport when\nJapan hosted the Games in 1964, and is\nnow practised by millions of people in\n(probably) every country in the world.\nPeople sometimes wonder why we use\nso much Japanese terminology in judo.\nThis is by no means unique in judo, most\nmartial arts use Japanese words; but in\njudo before you can get a belt you must\ndemonstrate an understanding of a few\nterms, and there are about a hundred\nwords a good judoka should understand.\nWe use a common language because judo\nis taught in exactly the same way all over\nthe world\u2014there is only one style:\nKodokan judo. It makes sense for a particular technique to have a universal\nname. Some names accurately describe\nthe technique, such as ip pons eoin age( one handed shoulder throw) or okur i eri-jim e( sliding collar strangle); while other\nnames like yama-arashi (mountain storm)\nor tani-o toshi( valley drop) are poetic\nrather than practical.\nAnother unusual aspect of judo is its\netiquette. This chiefly comprises tachi-rei\n(standing bows) and za-rei (kneeling\nbows). A judoka should give a standing\nbow on entering and leaving the dojo or\nthe tatami (the mat on which all training\nand competition if performed), and before\nand after a contest. The kneeling bow\nformally opens and closes a training\nsession. There are also specific ways you must wear your judo gi( judo suit) and obi\n(your belt). A judoka must never question\nthe referee's decisions in a contest. I 've\nnever seen that happen, but I expect he\nwould be penal is ed or disqualified.\nA point I should stress is that judo is\nperfectly safe. The first thing you learn,\nbefore any throw or hold, is uk emi waz a, break fall techniques. These are ways of\ndissipating the force of a throw, mainly in\nthe arms. The tatami is cushioned, which absorbs much of the impact, and injury is\nextremely rare. The permitted strangles\nand arm locks cause temporary pain but\nno injury. There are no at emi waz a( striking techniques: punches, kicks etc)\nwhatsoever, although such techniques\ncould easily be incorporated into judo to\nform a powerful martial art.\nImperial College judo club trains twice\na week in the Union gym (in Beit Quad).\n2nd dan black belt Peter Swettenham\ntakes the class on Tuesday, on Thursday\n1st dan Jon Lean. Both classes start at\n6.30pm and are two hours long. If you\nthink you are interested in judo, come\nalong to a session in loose clothes like at shirt and track-suit bottoms, or (of\ncourse) a judo suit if you have one.\nPlease note, however, that a karate suit is\nnot suitable for judo. The judo gi is\nreinforced to survive the rough handling\nit receives, a karate suit is light and will\nrip.\nFor more information about the club, or\nabout judo in general, please see Peter\n(Management MSc), Jon (Pet Eng 4), Reg\nCook (Mech Eng2), or myself Ultan\nMcCarthy (Physics 3).\nSquaring up: a good grip is essential to control your opponent.\n\n"

The Computer Misuse Act 1990\nnecessitates universities to take a serious\nview on hacking and the introduction of\nviruses.\nIn a letter to Felix, Peter Mee, College\nRegistrar, states that although it may be\npossible to deal with computer misuse\nwithin college through internal\ndisciplinary measures, this may not\nalways be possible.\nAt the December meeting of the Board\nof Studies the following addition to the\nRegulations for Students was passed:\n'Computer misuse will be regarded as a serious offence and will be dealt with\nunder the College Disciplinary Procedure\nor, where appropriate, under the\nprovisions of the Computer Misuse Act\n1990'\nUnder the Act hacking and the\nintroduction of viruses into computer\nsystems and networks are criminal\noffences. The Act identifies three specific\noffenses: unauthorised access to a computer system, unauthorised access to\na computer system with intent to commit\nor facilitate the commission of a serious\ncrime and unauthorised modification of\ncomputer material.\nMr Mee also said that remedying the\ndamage caused by computer misuse\ninvolves a great deal of work and is a gross misuse of College resources.\nThe Act and the new regulation are\nalready in effect.\nPolice Calls Union Break-in\nRestricted\nIn any incident not involving danger to\nlife or property, security must now gain\npermission to call the Police. Only Ms\nValerie Straw, Facilities Manager, or\nGordon Marshall, Director of Estates, may\ngive such permission.\nMs Straw stressed that this will only\napply to non-emergency incidents, stating\nthat the change of policy was to avoid\ncalling the Police unnecessarily.\nThieves broke into the Union Office over\nChristmas but were foiled whilst trying to\nbreak into the trophy cupboard.\nOn the 20th December, whilst Union\nstaff were in a meeting in the Snack Bar,\ntwo men stole money, credit cards and\ncheque books. Whilst trying to open a cabinet underneath the trophy cupboard,\nhowever, they, set off an alarm. The\ncabinet, tidied the day before, was empty.\nWhen staff arrived on the scene, the\nmen escaped through the stairwell\nentrance, injuring Paul Shanley, Union\nPresident. When staff gave chase, one\nman ran into The Royal School of Mines\nand was lost. The other ran towards\nKensington, chased by Tom Cunnington,\nNick Marley and Benjamin Turner, Union\nDeputy President.\nMr Turner caught the man outside\nBarkers in Kensington High Street after\nstopping him from getting on a bus.\nAll of the stolen items except for \u00a330\ncash have been recovered. Police are\nnow questioning a man who has pleaded\nnot guilty.\nIraqis Stay Lost & Found Power Loss\nNone of Imperial's Iraqi students were\ninvolved in last week's expulsions.

There are aproximately 15 Iraqi\nstudents studying here.\nAn honours board, stolen from the Union\nDining Hall two years ago, has resurfaced\nat a National Rag Conference, where it\nwas auctioned off.\nIts return to the Union has now been\nsecured by Union President Paul Shanley\nafter negotiations with three other\nstudent unions.

    "content": "Michael Newman introduces a new programme of talks\norganised by the Imperial College Huxley Society.\nGodlessness FELIX\n30th January 1991 is the centenary of the\ndeath of Charles Bradlaugh: The man\nwho made secularism a mass movement\nin the 19th Century, a man who successfully entered Parliament as a Liberal MP, despite a five year battle due\nto his notoriety as an atheist and\nsupporter of sex education, each time\nbeing re-elected by his constituents!\nAs so many writers, publishers and\nbooksellers had been taken to court and\nprison for blasphemy, Bradlaugh\nsuccessfully challenged the establishment\nwith the fight for his right to represent,\nspeak and publish. He was one of the\nmost popular speakers of his day.\nThe organisation he led, the National\nSecular Society, is still campaigning\nagainst the injustices of censorship,\nblasphemy laws, religious worship and\nschools, the influence of Christian religion\nin the media and in our laws. The\nfigurehead today, Barbara Smoker, is a tough and sharp-witted lady who, since\nher early experiences of Catholicism, has\nspent her life fighting religious bigotry\nand pro pog and a. She, along with other Humanists, led a march in support of Salman Rushdie, as a counter-demonstration to the Muslim\nprotests. She performs non-religious\nfunerals and weddings, including\nweddings between homosexuals and\nlesbians. She has written books on\nHumanism and the campaign for the right\nto euthanasia. For decades she has been\na strident voice in the media defending\nthe rights of atheists and agnostics.\nMany people are under the false\nimpression that this is a Christian country.\nThere is an ignorance of the contributions\nto our culture and history of those people\nwho profess Godlessness. (If Michael\nHeseltine had won the leadership election\nall our political leaders would have been\nnon-believers!). This ignorance also\nincludes that of the history of Imperial\nCollege.\nImperial College, or the Normal School\nof Science, was set up as a place to train\nscience teachers. HG Wells won a meagre\nscholarship here as a student teacher.\nThis was a part of the Government's plans to improve our schools, resulting in\nthe 1870 Education Act that created a state school system. Amongst those\ninvolved in the campaign for education,\nand specifically science education, as well\nas helping to implement the Act was\nProfessor TH Huxley, Dean of the\nCollege. His writings, teaching and\ncampaigning clearly show the relationship\nbetween his agnosticism, a term he\ncoined, and his aims in science teaching:\na tradition that can be found within the\nstaff of Imperial throughout its history.\nAs an acknowledgement to, and\ncelebration of, this tradition the TH Huxley Society has organised a series of\nspeakers, every Thursday lunchtime this\nterm. They will cover the history of Wells\nand Huxley at the College, the history of\nblasphemy, the personal beliefs of those\nleading the Secularist movement, the life\nof Bradlaugh and the relationship\nbetween science and religion.\nThe society is also examining the way\nwe see and understand science. We are\ninviting poets to read and discuss their\nworks. An exhibition public ising our first\npoetry event, with Jo Shapcott, can be\nseen in the bookstore window. Her\nbooks, along with those of our President,\nthe international poet and scientist Dr\nMiroslav Holub, as well as the book\nBreaking the Shackles\u2014about Imperial\nCollege, Wells and Huxley \u2014 can be\nbought from the Union Bookstore.\nThe National Poetry Society is involved\nwith us in organising a resident poet, at\nImperial College, to examine and describe\nscience here. For those interested in\npoetry, the Poetry Society's events are\nheld on Tuesday or Thursday evenings, at\nEarl's Court Square, five minutes from\nEarl's Court tube station. There is a good\nbar and you can get to meet the poets\nafter their readings.\nMembership forms are available from\nthe ICU Bookstore.\nLook out for the Huxley Society\nnewsletter, Experiment, coming out soon.\nTHE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE TO BE HELD IN HUXLEY340 AT1.00 PM ON THURSDAYS17 th January\u20147b Hell with GodBarbara Smoker explains her life-long\nfight against religion\n24th January\u2014Bradlaugh\u2014the hero\nof 19th Century Secularism\u2014Jim\nHerrick, writer and editor of 'New\nHumanist'\n31st January\u2014Humanist\nCeremonies\u2014 Jane Wynne Willson,\nChairwoman of the British Humanist\nAssociation, talks about the growing\nnumber of Humanist weddings,\nfunerals and naming ceremonies.\n7th February\u2014 'Mainly Christian\nWorship in Our Schools' The Current\nBattleground\u2014John White,\neducation a list, member of interfaith\neducation group, adviser to LEAs.\n14th February (Huxley 213)\u2014\nReligion and Science\u2014Professor Sir\nHermann Bondi, international physicist\nand President of the British Humanist\nAssociation re-examines Huxley's theme.\nEvening\u2014Love in the Lab\u2014So\nShapcott reads her poetry.\n21st February\u2014Breaking the\nShackles\u2014Michael Newman talks about\nhis book on Imperial College, Wells\nand TH Huxley.\nCHARTER STUDENTS ARTISTS WRITERS\nENTERTAIN The Angry Young Publishing House needs\nyou to contribute to 'CHARTER' magazine\nand other periodicals.

    "content": "The Love for Three Oranges\nAnd Madam Butterfly\nEnglish National Opera at the London Coliseum\nThe current ENO season has\nreached new heights of excellence\nwith the combination of Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges and\nPuccini's Madam Butterfly, both in staging\nand musically.\nThe Love for Three Oranges is a well\ndeserved rapid revival of last year's production. A nonsensical tale of a nonexistent kingdom where the Prince is\ndying until the faithful jester Truffaldino\nmakes him laugh. The Prince is then\ncursed to fall in love with three oranges\nand sets out on a quest to find them, o Needless to say there is a happy ending\nas the prince finds his beautiful bride;\nalong the way there are large dollops of\nwicked witches, evil relations and plotting\nprime ministers.\nThe production captures the spirit of\nabsurdity beautifully: the set groans under\nthe weight of distorted perspective;\nDonald Maxwell's contorted walk as the\nevil prime minister Leander will make\nyou wince; and the costumes allow no-one, least of all the heroes, to appear\ndignified or sensible. The audience are\ninvited to use 'scratch ' n' sniff cards at\nappropriate moments to produce suitable\nodour s. This is opera at its most fun,\nfrivolous and accessible.\nNone of this is at the expense of the\nmusic. All the parts are well sung,\nespecially Stuart Kale a sT ruff aldi no and\nAlan Woodrow as the Prince. As always\nthe orchestra are well drilled. This\nproduction is not just recommended, it is\na must for anyone who has a passing\ninterest in being amused.\nThe production of Madam Butterfly is\ndifferent but no less commendable. It\ndraws on the darkest elements in this\ntragic tale. Pinkerton, the American sailor\nwho marries a Japanese geisha, lightly\nand frivolously, knowing he can divorce\nher simply by abandoning her, is played\na heartless cad: insensitive, uncultured\nand careless. Susan Bullock brings naivety\nand childishness to the role of the\nbewildered Butterfly, who abandons her\nown culture for her husband and refuses\nto believe he will not return. She also\nbrings a powerful and pure voice which rises brilliantly to the challenge of\nPuccini's score.\nThe whole production brings new light\nto this old favourite, stressing the\nalienation between the Japanese and the\nAmericans and the lack of understanding\nbetween the two worlds. The set is both\nstark and on a human scale, difficult to\ndescribe in a few words, but always\ninventive and reflecting the many moods\nof the story.\nBoth productions are a must. The Love\nfor Three Oranges continues until\nJanuary 24th and Madam Butterfly until\nFebruary 9th. Tickets are from \u00a36, with\n100 seats at \u00a34 on the day and standing\nroom at \u00a33.50 if all seats have been sold.\nThe London Coliseum is on St Martin's Lane, near Trafalgar Square.\nLiz W mm\nProject presentation coming up?\nEnd the agony now!\nSpeaking Technically A handbook for professional scientists and engineers\non how to improve technical presentations\nby Sinclair Goodlad\nISBN 0 9515673 0 6f4.95( P&P UK \u00a31.00, Overseas \u00a32.50)\nObtainable from booksellers or direct from Sinclair\nGoodlad, Petersham Hollow, 226 Petersham Road,Petersham, Richmond, Surrey TW10 7 AL. \"It's brilliant\" British Telecom World\n\" What a good and useful book.\" Imperial College Engineer\n\" Dr.Goodlad's analysis of this subject is quite the most comprehensive and useful I have seen..\" The Structural Engineer\n\" ..tackles a subject which many find difficult or daunting\nwith personality and charm.
