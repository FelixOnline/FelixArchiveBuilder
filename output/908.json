    "content": "Kiddy Korner\nAlternatively, if you're doomed to\nescorting younger siblings, cousins,\ncomplete strangers etc. to the movies this\nsummer, Felix presents a quick view of\nsome of the better (ie. more tolerable)\nmovies out this summer. Conspicuous by\nits absence is The Rocketeer, Disney's attempt to succeed this year where Dick\nTracy failed last year. 'Rocketeer' is based\non those brilliant old series which feature\na man with a rocket on his back\nmysteriously not blowing up but instead\nsolving crimes, disasters etc. It's currently\nin the Big Secrecy Phase prior to its US\nrelease, whereupon you can expect to be\nbored rigid by everything from RocketWogan to Rocket-Condoms. Some time\nlater this year Disney will release The\nRescuers Down Under .which if it lives\nup to the standards of the first could be\neven better than The Silence Of The\nLambs.\nThe only other remotely kiddy film not\nherein is Rock-A Doodle, featuring\nancient cartoon character Chanticleer the\nRooster. Who knows ?\nTMNT n:f file1 ec re to, lbe With nary a pause for pizza the\nfour lovable amphibians with poor\ndisguises are back with a vengeance. They kick butt, they talk jive,\nthey don't use skateboards (as they're\ngoing out of style) but they do\nbreakdance (?). And so to the plot. This\nmovie follows directly on from the last\n(although no previous knowledge is\nrequired) with the turtles kip ping at\nApril's and the Shredder in a garbage\ntruck. But you can't kill Shredder that\neasily so he's back too. Everyone seems\nto be back save Casey Jones, the sports\nequipment wielding psychotic from the\nformer excursion. This is because it is a real kiddies sequel with all the violence\nin a 'Tom and Jerry' style e rather than\nthe 'Hey kids! Knives are fun!' of the first.\nThis comedy violence idea actually\nworks. At one point Raphael even beats\nup a bad die with two sausages.\nAnyway, what about the ooze?. Well\nthe ooze of the title is the stuff that\nchanged the turtles and can be used to\nmutate. Pretty obviously you-know-who\ngets you-know-what and makes himself a couple of nasty guess-what-kids to fight\nthe-Nolan-Sisters. That's the story. Throw\nin the scientist in charge of ooze removal\n(David Warner, great actor), April O 'Neil\n(Paige Turco), a streetwise oriental kid\nwho's a karate genius (Ernie Reyes Jr.),\nand a rare cameo (I hope they're going to\nbe rare) by Vanilla Ice and you've got the\nwhole caboodle. It's aimed at the under\ntens and it's great fun. In the words of Mr\nTutti Frutti himself, 'Go Ninja! Go Ninja!\nGo!'.\nThe Amazing Machine II: the Secrets\nin the Taste\nDrop Dead Fred Cinderella\nAlternatively, if you don't want the\nkids influenced by even comedy\nviolence, you could take them to\nsee this. The basic story goes : Phoebe\nCates (great actress that she is) did not\nhave a particularly happy childhood\nbecause her mother had the disposition of\na badly tamed harpy. As a result she\ncreated an imaginary friend, Drop Dead\nFred, who happens to be Rik Mayall.\nNaturally, jolly japes follow, since our Rik\nis not known for his sensitive character\nportrayals.\nNow Phoebe is grown up she still looks\ntwelve years old and her marriage is on\nthe rocks, presumably because her\nhusband can no longer face her acting.\nShe gets taken home by The Megabeast\n(as Fred calls her mother). Once there,\nshe recalls Fred..\nWhat follows is fairly predictable, no, I do the film an injustice, extremely\npredictable, as Fred tries in his six-year-old way to reunite the couple against the\nphilandering husband's better efforts, but\nit's all very sweet in its way. In the end\nPhoebe comes to terms with herself and\nwith Fred...blah blah blah...\nThis is a pretty good film for the early\nteens and quite enjoyable for old folks so\nlong as you leave any more demanding\ninstincts at the door. Rik Mayall hardly\ncharts a new path for himself but is\npredictably competent in the role; Phoebe\nCates follows up her performance in\nGremlins 1\n1 (which won her so many\nOscars that she was forced to stand\ndown) in unnoticeable form. The support's okay, including Carrie Fisher as Phoebe's best friend (apart from Fred, of course).\nGood idea, fair execution, nice try\nPhoebe.\nThe Flying Gerbil and Friends.\nSix tickets! We were sent six tickets\nto see Cinderella\\ Oh joy. And as it\nturned out, Cinderella is my\ngirlfriend's favourite animated film of all\ntime (Akira move over). The reason for\nthis sudden re-release is that Cinders is 41\nthis year (?). And not a wrinkle! Its a wonderfully animated cartoon, all the\nbackdrops are wonderfully detailed, and\nthe characters are luxuriously drawn. One\nthing Cinderella does not do is travel\nwell. It remains firmly rooted in a traditionally valued, happy ever after\nscenario where impossible romance is\npossible- pre-marital sex get outta here-and the bad guys (gels) get their come-up pan ce. Having said that, it makes a refreshing change from modern cartoon\nfare (Killer Tomatoes et al) but sadly the\nprince turns out to be nothing more than\na one dimensional dancing prat with too\nmuch money for his own good. (An\nobvious metaphor for the eighties yuppy\ngeneration -Walt you're a genius).\nDisney's early films have become\ninstitutions and as such are part of the\nfabric of everyone's childhood. Go re-live\nit for an afternoon.\nJohn.\n12\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nThe personal observation of the happenings of Friday April 5th0 f mis year \u201e .\nThe Day Iraq was Invaded in London 9\nFELIX\nAt around 9.00am on April 5th of this\nyear fourteen Kurds made their way into\nthe Iraqi embassy on Queensgate,\nopposite the Huxley building of Imperial\nCollege, bypassing the light police\npresence at the time. Though in general\nhighly policed at that time of tension, the\nimmediate area was only being guarded\nby two policemen, and only one of these\nwas at the front door.\nPrior to the invasion, a group of\napproximately ninety Kurdish\ndemonstrators had assembled outside the\nembassy to protest about the treatment of\nthe Kurdish people in their Iraqi\nhomeland, a plight largely ignored by\nWestern governments until recently. The\nbuilding was not stormed in any\ntraditional form. One of the group of\nninety told a small group of journalists\nthat entry had been gained to the locked\nembassy by possession of the front door\nkey. Where this had been gained from he\ndidn't say.\nBy 9.30am the police presence had\ngained considerable strength and the\nstretch of Queensgate enclosing the\nbuilding had been sealed off, the rest of\nthe demonstration having been moved up\nthe road and out of the way. Prince\nConsort Road and Bremner Road had also\nbeen blocked, although at this point it\nwas still possible to walk through College\nvia both the Prince Consort Road and\nQueensgate entrances. People from\nneighbouring houses and the Crofton\nHotel were told that they could not move\ntheir cars, much to their distress.\nThe protestors inside began their\noccupation in style by throwing burning\nleaflets out of the windows together with\na fast incinerating picture of Saddam\nHussein. Iraqi diplomatic documents\nlittered a large stretch of Queensgate.\nThe Kurds appeared at the windows\nfleetingly and hung up a large banner\nasking that we 'STOP Saddam's genocide\nagainst the Kurdish People'. Various\noccupiers who began to shout out pleas\nfor help to the British public, held back\nby the police, found them virtually\nbeyond the reach of their vocal strength.\nLiaison with Imperial College Security\nclosed the Queensgate road entrance and\nallowed police entry to the Huxley\nbuilding for observation and control\npurposes\nA Hostage Control Room was\nset up on level 3 of Blackett as it was\nsuspected that one remaining Iraqi\ndiplomat was still within the embassy. It\nlater transpired that he had made his\nescape by the back entrance. At 11.30am policemen, clad in bullet proof vests,\ncrawled onto both the embassy's roof and\nthe top of Physics.\nThe three Kurds at the window spotted\nme and my camera in the building\nopposite and waved a leaflet for my\nbenefit. A second uniformed officer\nappeared on the embassy roof.\n\u2014 i11.55am, three police vans and a police\nbus passed the embassy on the college\nside of the road, as if displaying strength\nin the hope that the Kurds inside would\ngive up peacefully and leave. The Kurds\nremained and Home Office and Scotland\nYard personnel appeared on the scene.\n12.36pm, a team of five 'Blue Beret'\npolice, their commanding officer and\n12.51pm, the first Kurdish demonstrator\nwas removed from the embassy courtesy\nof two riot police. He was frog-marched\nto one of the vans chanting, but showing\nno sign of resistance. One by one the\nother thirteen were lead out at roughly\nfour minute intervals. None of them\nstruggled, some were quiet, but others\n12.08pm, the police on top of the\nembassy checked the masonry as if an\nSAS style counter siege was being\nplanned as with the Iranian embassy on\nthe other side of College. The policemen\nwere armed with pistols, their holsters\nclearly showing.\n12.13pm, the police vehicles drove past\nthe embassy again, packed full of riot\npolice.\n12.27pm, senior police officers appeared\non the roof of a building four blocks\nnorth of the embassy.\nanother senior official gathered at the\nEmbassy's front door. The men were\narmed with semi-automatic light rifles and\nmachine guns. The Landrover, bored with\nthe slow pace of the incident,\nmano eu ve red around the road destroying\nseveral traffic cones and crossed the\ncentral reservation for no apparent\nreason. It crossed my mind that the\ndriver was considering ramming the front\ndoor.\n12.34pm, Approximately thirty riot\npolice entered the building, police dogs\ncould be heard from the Landrover on\nthe street, while, in the background, the\ndemonstrators chanted.\n12.39pm, their voices weakening, the\noccupiers brought out a megaphone to\nproject their final plea; 'We are human.\nWe need your help. We want to leave\npeacefully, more than anyone else'.\nshouted the slogans 'Down down with\nSaddam' and 'Viva Viva Kurdistan'.\n1.48pm, the 'Blue Beret' force entered\nthe building with the dog to rou st the last\nman.\n1.51pm, the last demonstrator was\nescorted out of the building and the 'Blue\nBerets' check the building next door.\nThey left at 2.18pm, climbed back into\ntheir Landrover and drove off.\nI left and took my films to Reuters,\nnearly selling a photo and found myself\nreading the last edition of the Evening\nStandard. On the front page was an awful\npicture of a policeman on the embassy\nroof taken from Sky Television.\nWords and pictures\nby Chris Stapleton\n\n"

    "content": "E. W1R0 Antarctica\nThe continent surrounding the South\nPole constitutes nearly a tenth of the\nworld's land but is owned by no one. It is\nfree of war and to date entirely lacking in\nmanufacturing industry. It has no national\ngovernment and its temporary inhabitants\nare all principally involved with\ninvestigating or supporting some aspect of\nscience. Thanks to the Antarctic treaty of\n1959, science is king. It froze territorial\nclaims, banned military activity and\nestablished Antarctica as a nuclear free\nzone. But thirty years on, world demand\nfor mineral resources has risen, fuelling\nspeculation on Antarctica's mineral\nreserves and the political uncertainty\nregarding the future of the Antarctic\nTreaty.\nThe seventy million km2 of rock and\nice surrounding the southern pole,\nconstitutes the highest, coldest, most\nremote and least explored continent in\nthe world. Despite its extent, only a relatively small area about the size of\nSpain is exposed, free from permanent\nice. The geological mapping, of this\nexposure, completed so far has been\nmainly at a scale of 1:500 000. Such\nmapping omits features less than half a kilometre across. These resolutions are\ninsufficient to identify potential settings of\nmineral is ation. Of the hundreds of\nmetallic mineral occurrences reported on\nthe Antarctic Peninsula none have\nundergone the intensive sampling and\nanalysis required to describe their genesis\nand demonstrate their extent and\nimportance. Many are simply spectacular\nsurface oxide stains with little or no\nsubstance. At present they are only of\nacademic interest. Discussion of their\nexploitation is untimely and would be\nconsidered a farce within the mining\nindustry.\nDespite this lack of evidence,\nreconstruction of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, provokes\ncomparisons with once adjacent terrains.\nThis leads to parallels with mining\ndistricts in Australia, South America and\nSouth Africa. The popular media report\nfinds of economic concentrations of\nvaluable minerals (Times 23rd May 1989)\nand even scientific papers refer glibly to\n\"ores\" and \"economic deposits\". Abuse of\nthese terms has rendered them\nmeaningless in Antarctic literature. A single value of 0.09 parts per million gold\ndoes not imply the enviable grade of 0.09\ngram mes per tonne. \"Economic minerals\"\nin this context refer to minerals with a human resource potential which are\neconomically extracted elsewhere in the\nworld. Only too often the phrase is\nwrongly interpreted as an Antarctic\nmineral deposit which can be mined at a profit. Currently their is no ore in\nAntarctica. \"Ore-minerals\" have certainly\nbeen found, in fact almost every\nindustrial mineral, base and precious\nmetal occurs. But it is not until the\ntransport links are established, the deposit\nis extracted, refined and sold at a profit\nthat the term \"ore\" can be applied,\nexplains Dr Willan, economic geologist u for the British Antarctic Survey. It seems\nreasonable to believe that Antarctic crust\nis as mineralized as other continents,\nimplying perhaps 900 significant deposits.\nHowever, in the absence of data these\nresources are completely hypothetical. At\npresent there is more chance of finding\nsuch resources beneath the few hundred\nmetres of East Anglian chalk than the\ntwo kilometres of Antarctic ice.\nExisting geophysical surveys have\nproved inadequate for defining potential\nhydrocarbon traps. They do little more\n\n"

Then we wrap up\nLittle Chas in incense-scented toilet paper\nwhich seems to be very plentiful in the\nIraqi Embassy, and put him on the sign\nso we can carry him, and what with the\nwrappings, and the large swelling that he\nhas on his noggin from where Penguin\nslugs him, he looks very authentically\ninjured, indeed, and we are sure that the\ncoppers will let us pass without pass\nwithout asking any tough questions,\nmaybe thinking that His Excellency the\nAmbassador was not so pleased with our\ninsurance premiums.\nHowever, just as we are proceeding to\nlift Little Chas on the sign, the door from\nwhich we have just removed it opens like\na horse-trap at the start of the Derby and\na short guy wearing so many robes that\nhe is almost as bundled up as Little Chas,\nand whom I presume is His Excellency\ninhabitants of the Iraqi Embassy to depart\nas quickly as possible. In fact, I do not\ngive a hedgehog's deposits on Broadway\nfor our chances at this moment, and if\nanybody desires to lay a little six to five\non our survival, I will not give it to them,\neven if they offer me a thousand G's, since I consider it a very bad proposition,\nindeed.\nBut, just as I am preparing to hand in\nmy dice and go meet the Big Guy\nupstairs, I see a pineapple come sailing in\nthe window behind His Excellency the\nAmbassador, and it seems the other guys\nsee it too, because they all drop to the\nfloor as if they are shot, which surprises\nHis Excellency the Ambassador greatly\nsince he does not yet start to let off his\nrods. But this surprise is nothing\ncompared to the surprise he gets when\nthe pineapple goes boom, very loud, and\n\u00bb Am the Ambassador, though I do not enquire,\ncomes bustling out yelling a blue streak.\nNormally I will be all for b offing him with\nthe Rag can, if it is not too cracked by\nnow, and making a quick getaway, but I see that he is holding a John Roscoe in\neach fist, and waving them in a most\nunpleasant manner. He is in a most\nexcited state, and I judge that he is not\ntoo tickled that we try to borrow his\nname plate, since he continues to holler at\nus, and Happy Steve and Penguin and\nPaul Reynish and I are also hollering,\nbecause we are afraid more than\nsomewhat that he may start blasting with\nhis rods and pepper us all full of holes,\nand in addition to all this excitement\nthere is also a considerable co motion outside, because the mob are apparently\ntired of waiting and wish to help the\nsome pieces of it come and hit him in the\nback, making him fall down dead as a door nail, or maybe deader.\nOf course, I do not know for sure that\nhe is dead, but we do not hang around to\nsee if he is going to be rejuvenated, or\nwhat, since he may remember us and\nstart waving his John Roscoes again, so\nwe give Little Chas the old hey h up and\nlift him, and almost lift him clean into\norbit, since he is nothing but skin and\nbones and hair and toilet paper; and we\nlug him downstairs as fast as we can clip.\nAs we are going out the door he hops off\nthe name plate and says he prefers to\nwalk, but this does not matter any longer\nsince the coppers are too busy keeping\nfrom getting trampled like beetles by the\nmob to notice that he is walking when he\nis supposed to be a patient.\nWe do not go fifty yards before we\nhear that the mob is yelling extra loud,\nand on turning round we see that the\nIraqi Embassy is burning very nicely, and\nflames are shooting very prettily from all\nthe windows, because it appears someone\nmanages to throw a great deal of petrol\ninto the place and set it alight. None of\nthe parties present recalls seeing a joint\ntorched so professionally, although we\nare very fortunate in making a getaway\nwhen we do, since to be inside a place\nthat is on fire in such a way is likely to\nbe most uncomfortable, and also fatal.\nI see that Happy Steve is royally\npleasured up at obtaining this name plate, for his kisser is almost in a straight line,\ninstead of with the corners drooping\ndown so far that you fear they will fall\noff, as is usual. Moreover, Little Chas is\nsmelling so sweet from being wrapped up\nin incense-scented toilet paper, that he is\nun recognisable, and in fact we almost\nlose him, which pleasures up Happy Steve\nso much that I fear his kisser will bust.\nWell, there is little more to tell, except\nthat some days later I am sitting with\nPenguin in the Caterpillar Cafe, enjoying\na dish of chicken tikka, since the chilli\nseems recently to be going downhill in\nthis establishment, and not hearing any\nloud thuds whatsoever, when I see Happy\nSteve; and although I see many a sad-looking guy in my time, and most of the\ntime it is Happy Steve himself, I wish to\nstate that I never see him looking sadder,\nand indeed I think that maybe the\ncorners of his mouth drop off altogether.\nThis puzzles me, since I imagine that he\nwill still be up on cloud nine, or ten, or\nmaybe higher, on account of getting the\nname plate from the Iraqi Embassy, and\nso I enquire of Penguin what causes this\nsudden depression.\n'Well, I hear just now', says Penguin,\n'that this morning he gets a very polite\nnote from the office of the gendarmes,\nrequesting that he return the sign to the\nIraqi Embassy. Apparently,' says Penguin,\n'one of the coppers guarding the joint\nsurvives the attack of the mob, and\ntestifies that he sees a guy with a very\nsad kisser flogging insurance, and also\nsmells something very strange, and the\nlocal gendarmes know there is only one\ntime that you find a strange smell and a sad kisser side by side, which is when\nLittle Chas and Happy Steve go\nborrowing property together. Naturally,\nHappy Steve cannot refuse such a request, especially since it is so polite, but\nthe fact that he must return the sign\ndiscomfits him no little. However,' adds\nPenguin, 'this is nothing compared to the\ndiscomfiture he feels when he discovers\nthat, the party who tosses the first\npineapple, and starts the riot which\nnearly causes us to be fried like schnitzel s inside the Iraqi Embassy, is no-one but\nShifty Shan.'\n18\n\n"

    "content": "Trespassers on the\nMarch saw the first visit of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual and political\n\"Dalai Lama...Dalai Lama....\" the\npilgrim repeated the words over and over\nagain, stroking my arm with her\nblackened finger nails and fumbling with\nher prayer beads. 'Dalai Lama la mei', (I haven't any Dalai Lama pictures) I replied. The golden roofs of Huangzhong\nmonastery shone in the afternoon light in\nthe depression below.\nIn 1950 I would have been standing in\nTibet, but today it was Qinghai province\nin the Peoples Republic of China. Since its\nforceful occupation over forty years ago,\nTibet has been administered as an\n'autonomous' region of China.\nTibet's recorded history began in 127\nBC. During the next two millenium,\nshrouded by its Himalayan veil, Tibet\nacquired a romantic image which hides a darker past. Behind this ice curtain the\nmajority of the population were all but\nslaves trapped by poverty and punitive\ntaxation. Five percent of Tibetans owned\nmost of the land, while the monasteries\nowned great estates covering a third of\nthe country, consuming half of Tibet's total revenue and controlling tens of\nthousands of serfs. Every family in the\nland was expected to contribute one son\nto the monastic order and there was\nvirtually no education for the rest of the\npopulation. Despite the far from ideal\nfeudal theocracy of its past, the\nimpending Chinese holocaust would cause\nunimaginable destruction and suffering.\nTibet's borders remained from the tenth\ncentury until the Communist Chinese\ninvasion in 1949 to \"liberate the country\nfrom feudal control and to 'return' it to\nChinese sovereignty.\" Fearing invasion,\nTibet sent a delegation to Britain and the\nUSA. Both countries refused to recognise\nher as an independent nation, with no\narmy of her own and precious few\nresources with which to repay them.\n\"one sixth of the\npopulation have\nbeen killed\"\nSince then, in the name of liberation,\nmore than 1.2 million Tibetans, one sixth\nof the population, have been killed.\nMonks, previously accounting for up to\none in five of the native Tibetans, are\ntoday few and far between. More than\n7.5 million Chinese settlers have been\ntransplanted into Tibet, thus making the\nsix million indigenous people a minority\nin their own country. During the Cultural\nRevolution over 6,000 monasteries,\ntemples and historic structures were\nlooted and raised. Such looting of 'your\nown territory' calls into question the Han\nChinese view of their 'conquest'.\nIn 1979, a program of renovation began\nand selected temples have been rebuilt in\nthe name of tourism. Today though, study\nand teaching of Buddhism are forbidden\nand thousands of religious and political\nprisoners remain in prisons and forced\nlabour camps.\nLord Ennals, the president of Britain's all-party group for Tibet, who invited the\nDalai Lama to visit Britain, describes\nTibet as: \" A slave state in which people\nare shot, detained and tortured for their\nbelief in freedom.\"\nHis Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama,\nTenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual\nand temporal leader of the Tibetan people.\nIn 1950, at the age of 15, with China\ninvading, His Holiness was called upon to\nassume full political power. Despite talks\nwith Mao Tse-tung and other Chinese\nleaders in 1954, his efforts to bring\npeaceful solutions to the conflict were\nthwarted by an uncompromising Peking\ngovernment. The stalemate came to a head in March 1959 when thousands of\nTibetans demonstrating against Chinese\noccupation were killed.\nEscaping at night and in disguise, the\nDalai Lama, accompanied by some 87,000\nTibetan refugees, fled to northern India.\nBorn on the 6th July 1935, in northeast\nTibet, he was recognised as the\nreincarnation of his predecessor at the\nage of two. With his older brother, he\nwas bought to the Potala Palace in Lhasa\nto begin his education. This culminated in\na final examination before an audience of\n20,000 monk scholars, involving the\ndebating of logic and metaphysics.\nSince 1960 he has resided in the town of\nDharamsala. He refuses to return to his\nhomeland until the Chinese withdraw and\nrecognise his claims, both to religious\nleadership and as head of the Tibetan\nGovernment in exile.\nDalai Lamas are the manifestations of\nthe Bodhisattva of Compassion. For\nTenzin Gyatso, with the cause of his\nRoof of the World\nleader, to Britain for three years. Christopher Riley spoke to him.\nsuffering so clearly identified, exercising\nthis compassion, cannot have been easy.\nBut the 14th Dalai Lama is adamant that\nthe Sino-Tibetan problems will be solved\npeacefully. For his persistent compassion\nand opposition of violence he received\nthe Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\nThe Chinese maintain that their forty\nyear occupation has removed any doubt\nof China's right to the \"tribal area\". They\nare now rewriting Tibet's history, but\ndespite the duration of this occupation,\nnothing has happened to legitimize\nChina's presence in Tibet. Would forty\nyears of Iraqi occupation have made the\nKuwait situation irreversible? Unlike\n\"Britain's position is\nnot satisfactory\"\nKuwait, there has been no international\naction to liberate Tibet. There is no oil to\nmotivate the UN. The Dalai Lama alone\nrepresents the task force. Since 1967 he\nhas travelled the world on lecture tours,\nvisiting 41 nations, to bring the plight of\nhis country to the attention of the world.\nMarch of this year saw his first visit to\nthis country for three years. The British\ngovernment, however, refused to meet\nhim, at risk of jeo pardi sing the delicate\nrelationships with Peking - Hong Kong\nreverts to Chinese control in 1997.\nOn the fourth of his six day visit to\nBritain the Dalai Lama held a press\nconference. Sitting in front of the red,\nyellow and blue Tibetan national flag and\nframed by two Himalayan Snow Lions,\nbathed by a golden sun he was\nquestioned about the parallels of Tibet\nwith the situations in Kuwait and the\nBaltic States.\n\"two generations of\noccupation \"\n'There are similarities between the\nTibetan and Kuwait situations. Human\nrights violations and torture took place in\nboth cases, but this is where the\nsimilarities end. In Kuwait the atrocities\nonly remained for a few months. In Tibet\nthey have existed for almost two\ngenerations. The motives for persecution\nin Kuwait were not religious.' In Tibet we\nhave seen the systematic dismantling and\ndestruction of Buddhism. He felt the\nwestern attitudes, over the Baltic States,\nwere healthy. 'It is good to make your\nviews clear. The West, including Britain\nshould be more critical of China. It is not\nnecessary to be pro-Tibet but just pro-justice, pro-truth.'\nCritical of the British government's weak stance on Tibet, he described their\npresent views as 'not satisfactory.'\nStressing the importance of standing up\nto China, he said it was important that\nBritish policy should not be based on\nChinese propaganda. Propaganda which\nhas mislead the British government to\nwrite-off Tibet as 'autonomous' - with the\nChinese occupying a 'special position' in\nthe region. 'The attitude of some\ncountries towards China is, I feel a little\nover-cautious. If you concede too much,\nthe other side becomes bolder and\nbolder.' We need not worry about the\npeople of Hong Kong, he explained.\n'China relies strongly on Hong Kong for\neconomic support - this guarantees a better situation for Hong Kong Chinese.'\nReturning to Kuwait, His Holiness was\nasked if Iraqi torturers could have been\nremoved from Kuwait peacefully, or are\nthere occasions when force is needed?\n'Basically the proper method to solve\nthe problems is non-violence. Violence\nand war are very unpredictable, with no\nguarantee of the desired consequences. It\nis better to avoid violence. Whether the\nmethod of violence is justified or not, we\ncan only judge much latter. Violence is\nlike a very strong pill. It may relieve pain\nfrom certain illness, but side effects\ncannot be predicted.' Side effects which\nhave perhaps now manifest in the\nKurdish backlash.\n\"it's not necessary\nto be pro-Tibet, but\njust pro-justice, pro-truth \"\nNot only have the Chinese imposed\ntheir most brutal and inhuman communist\nregime upon Tibet, but they are also\nforcing their appalling environmental\nrecord on the roof of the world. They\nhave started mining in southern Tibet,\nthe Dalai Lama said. 'Up to 60 lorries a day are transporting minerals out of the\nregion.' The deforestation and\nindustrialisation are being conducted\nwithout regard for the environment.\nBecause of the high altitude, (a lot of the\ncountry is above 5000 m) once damage is\ndone it takes much longer to repair.\n'Environmental damage inflicted on Tibet\nhas climatic consequences in the\nneighbouring states, Nepai, India, and\nChina.'\n'But what causes anxiety is the\npopulation transfer', he said. In the\nnortheast of Tibet new Chinese towns\nhave been built on pasture land, forcing\nnomads into the hills and leading to\nquarrelling and killing between Tibetans\nfighting for scarce grazing land.\nNaively perhaps, the people of China\nstill believe that their occupation of Tibet\nis \"for the good of the Tibetan people.\"\nEven those Chinese who have first hand\nexperience of Tibet are unable to see\nthrough the propaganda. Lu Tsun Sheng\nwas sent to Lhasa for eight years during\nthe 'Cultural Revolution'.\n'The Tibetans were just savages, feeding\ntheir dead to the vultures and skinning\npeople alive as a punishment,' he\nexplained. 'We have brought them\ncivilisation. They can now watch colour\nTV, they have electricity, roads, and\ngenerally a better standard of living. We\nhave established China's largest\nhydrothermal energy project, and are\nactively mining metal life rous ore, and\ncoal.'\n\"such progress has\nonly benefited the\nChinese economy\"\nBut is all this \"development\" really for\nthe good of the Tibetan people? 'No one\ncan deny that there has been no progress\nunder Chinese occupation', His Holiness\nexplained. 'There has been some progress\n- a new airport, hospitals, schools and\nsome small scale industry.' But the\ndestruction, which the Chinese never\nadmit, totally outweighs the progress, he\nsaid. 'Such progress has only benefited\nthe economy of the Chinese.'\nHis Holiness seems sure that the\nincreasingly repressive nature in China is\na sign of weakness. 'Unless they use force\nthe situation becomes out of control. This\ncreates a very negative image in the\noutside world and the Chinese\ngovernment are concerned with China's image. But isolating China is not the\nanswer. Pushing China into isolation is\nunwise; bringing China into mainstream is\nmy belief.'\n\n"

Nor MacGyver or\nAutoman. Neither is there a sniff of Lee\nMajors (The Fall Guy) and Howie in a dress.\nIt does include Terminator 2 :\nJudgement Day. Summer just wouldn't be summer without tea and scones on the\nlawn and a bit of multi-million dollar\nviolence. Arnie's an android, Cameron's the director and the plot's a secret.\nChances are it won't feature Howie in a dress. Vying for pole position with Arnie\nand vying with Tom Bergin's effort comes\nthe thinking man's bread and butter,\nKevin Costner, in Prince Of Thieves\nwhere he dons his green tights and goes\nsinging through the treetops. Or will he?\nOr will he examine the natives of\nSherwood Forest from a sympathetic\nviewpoint over three hours of nice\nscenery? Who knows? Kevin Costner\ndoes, for one. Why don't you ask him ?\nWe're still trying to find his phone\nnumber. I once saw Vince from Grange\nHill. Friends of the stars, that's us..\nHudson Hawk emerges in July, with\nBruce Willis as a spunky young burglar\nwho turns to espionage. This film is\ndirected by the man who brought you\nHeathers and Meef The Applegates but\nfinanced by the man who brought you\nDie Hard II so big-budget fun aplenty.\nDoing quite well Stateside with everyone\nbut the critics.\nIn a desperate attempt to burn off all\nthe big movies in a single category, we\nbring you Backdraft, in which Kurt\nRussell (did you know he's been stepping\nout with Goldie Hawn? Remember where\nyou heard it first, folks) and William (not\nAlec, who's been stepping out with Kim\nBasinger) Baldwin star as fire-fighting\nbrothers. Enough said.\nThis category would not be fulfilling\nThe Amazing\nwithout telling you what Steven Seagal is.\nFirst he was Nico, then he was Hard To\nKill, but now he's been Marked For Death anyway. Shortly he'll be Out For\nJustice. We'd like to wish him luck in his\nfuture activities whether At The Dentist's or Scared Of Heights..\nA Kiss Before Dying stars Sean Young\nand Matt Dillon as well as Max 'Ming The\nMerciless' von Sydow in the second\nadaptation of the Ira Levin novel. This\nmeans it should be great plot wise, but\ndoes it translate to the screen ? Word has\nit that it does not..\nA few ti ddl ers.. Teen Agent looks quite\ngood. Can you spot the deliberate mistake\nin the last sentence? Boyz N The Hood\nreceived critical acclaim at Cannes; New\nJack City featuring Ice T( not to be\nconfused with iced tea, which you might\nalso like to try this summer) caused\nviolent uproar Stateside and wins the\nMost Dangerous Film To See award.\nFinally, two from this month; State Of\nGrace featuring the ever-versatile Sean\nPenn and King Of New York starring\nthe go lem esque Christopher Walken. We\ncan tell you nothing about these films.\nThe Jim Davidson\nCorner Actually, it's not. it's comedy.\nLet's start with Another You( no\nthanks, I just had one). (Crap gag ! Crap\ngag!) . Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder as\n(wait for it) a duo of Unlikely Criminals;\nPryor is a con man doing community\nservice by looking after Wilder, who is a pathological liar. Advance reports are\nthat there may be many comical pauses\nand Richard Pryor may say \"shit\" a lot.\nLife Stinks. Well, yes, but this is Mel\nBrooks not taking the piss and word has\nit if you're looking for a good film you\nmight be better off at Return To The\nBlue Lagoon. Don't quote us on this. It\nmight be great.\nIncidentally, we're not kidding about\nReturn To.... See below.\nPa-pa pa-pa pa-pa pa-pa pa-pa-pa pa-pa\npa-pa pa-pa pa-pa PA! Pearl And Dean\nPresent\nNothing But Trouble (did you know\nyou can get Cool Dude Smarties with\nsunglasses?) starring Dan Aykroyd, Chevy\nChase and Demi Moore (isn't she pretty?\nShe's stepping out with Bruce Willis).\nFrom what we've read it's failed to make\nFlying Gerbil Machine\nanyone anywhere laugh ever. Even the\nAmericans thought it was bad. This is the\ncountry that brought you Out Of This\nWorld. However, it does contain John\nCandy in drag, as opposed to Howie from\nThe Fall Guy.\nOnly The Lonely, from the same\npeople who brought you Home Alone,\nstars John Candy (presumably not still in\ndrag) (although Howie might be), Ally\nSheedy as - get this - mortician love\ninterest - and Maureen O 'Hara as an\ninterfering mother.\nSylvester Stallone makes an attempt to\nemulate Arnie and move into the comedy\nbracket in the mob farce Oscar which is\ncurrently doing great You-Know-Where.\nAs opposed to a Ray Clooney farce, in\nwhich he would lose his trousers and\nmeet his wife while with a young\nsecretary at the vicar's garden party.\nShame, really.\nSoapdish. An all-star cast featuring\nWhoopi Goldberg, Sally Field (who was in\nSmokey and The Bandit with Burt\nReynolds.

As an\nAnzac biker named Lobo. Who is really\njust pretending in order to get off with\nJami Gertz. Frankly you'd be better off\nlooking for comedy-shaped potatoes.\nFilms That Refuse To Be\nPidgeonholed\nOkay.. Most eagerly awaited (by us,\nanyway) is Edward Scissorhands, which\nrelates the adventures of an artificial\nhuman with a variety of kitchen\nimplements for Moulinex mittens. Said\nadventures seem to relate largely to\ntopiary and kebabs along with romantic\nAttractions\nslag off the Summer's films\nadvances to a blonde Winona Ryder\n(who's stepping out with Johnny Depp\nboo hiss); Johnny 'Bastard' Depp (who's stepping out with Winona Ryder) plays\nthe eponymous Mr Ed. Tim Burton directs\nwhich means it may be attractive but\nmeandering (viz Batman) or just good ol'\nfashioned fun (Beetlejuice).\nAnother film which may be attractive\nand meandering is Thelma and Louise\nwhich is (of all things) a road movie\ndirected by Ridley {Alien, Bladerunner)\nScott. Thelma and Louise are a pair of\nyoung ladies who decide to escape their\nlives and in the course of things get\nentangled with the law. Susan Sarandon\nis Thelma and Louise is played by Geena\nDavies (who's stepping out with Jeff\nGoldblum, dont'y know).\nOff And Running is another road\nmovie about a groups of 'varied' (read\ncontrived) individuals who are thrown\nforcibly into each other's company and\nyours too. Is it good ? A tough ie. It's certainly not promising.\nStill staying with vehicular action we\nhave Harley Davidson and the\nMarlboro Man who are Mickey Rourke\nand Don (snort) Johnson (who's stepping\nout with Meg Ryan) as two ass-kicking\nheroes who are trying to save the local\norphanage from Mr. Big. That's almost\nright, but substitute \"biker's bar\" for\n\"orphanage\" and \"bank\" for \"Mr. Big\"\nand you have the basic idea. Sounds\ngood, huh ?\nPossibly the best film in this particular\nsector is Jungle Fever, believed by\nmany to have been robbed of the Palme\nD 'Or at Cannes. This is a Spike Lee film\nabout ah interracial relationship (ooh,\ndangerous) and has a Stevie Wonder\nsoundtrack. Depending on your tastes this\nallows either one or two reasons to see it.\nIf you need a third, Lee has an increasing\nreputation as a black (in both senses)\ncomedy director.\nLatest in the series of Euro-fl ics to\nundergo the Hollywood treatment is\nPertwee's seminal Die Kroppe, which has\nbeen remade into Potatoes! and stars\nRoseanne Barr in the title role. John\nMcTiernan directs.\nOnce Around is the tale of Whistling\nJack's Trouser Press. Okay, so it's not. It's about a Catholic woman (Holly Hunter)\nwho falls in love with an salesman\n(Richard Dreyfuss). Might be okay.\nRegarding Henry. Great title. Features\nHarrison Ford dying early on.\nReincarnation and happy vibes..\nClass Action stars Gene Hackman and\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as father-and-daughter lawyers who are forced to\noppose each other in a case of rich vs.\npoor. As you might expect this also\ninvolves them Examining Their\nRelationship. Both Hackman and\nMastrantonio are fairly adept at their\ncraft so it shouldn't be too wince worthy. Where Angels Fear To Tread is\nbased on the E.M. Forster novel of\ncolonial Brits abroad, something to fear\nfor those of us who have endured A Passage To India. The usual cast (you\nknow them already), probably the usual\nlocation footage, maybe the same plot (a widow and her strait-laced companion\nwandering in tropical climes), probably\nnot the greatest movie this summer.\nThe Hairdresser's Husband is the\nmuch-lauded tale of bald Antoine and his\nhairdresser fetish. Eh? Yes indeed, a man\nwho gets the hots for (female) barbers.\nStrange blok e indeed, but a big thumbs-up from all and sundry means the\npromising plot is well executed.\nDying Young is Julia Roberts' Serious\nActress film (who's stepping out with\nKiefer Sutherland, but they've postponed\nthe wedding) about a pretty (obviously)\nnurse who falls in love with a bald\nleukaemia victim. And then she leaves\nhim and he dies. No, not really. Test\naudiences got so upset they changed the\nending.\nOne Good Cop is about Michael\nKeaton adopting three cute kids after his\nbuddy is cut down before his time. This is\nnow about the fifteenth movie based on\nthis premise. Fourteen of those were\nredundant..\nFinally, Liza Minelli - wait for it - in\nStepping Out (hooray!). Liza seeks to\nescape typecasting in a role as a tap-dancer, co-starring Julie Walters and\nShelley Winters (who died in The\nPoseidon Adventure. Showbiz, huh ?)\nThe Shit Bin:\nNot Necessarily Shit : Switch is a Blake\nEdwards movie about a man in a woman's body (spiritually, anyway), the\nbody in question being Ellen Barkin's. This may well be a pointless exercise,\nsince Steve Martin seems to have just\nabout exhausted the possibilities of this\nidea in All Of Me. Dutch is a John\nHughes movie in which a man and his\ngirlfriend's brat break down and have to\nCo-Operate (can YOU say Co-Op-Er-Ate)\nto survive, in the process coming to\nterms with each other As An Individual.\nSounds crap to us. Navy S.E.A.L.S is the\nrisible tale of Sheen & Biehn kicking ass\nin the Middle Eas.t in an inflated tale of\nmilitary der ring do. Great.\nWe now turn to the amazingly titled\nWhore which Ken Russell tosses to his\nless than adoring public. This is the warm\nand wet tale of an everyday hooker\nwhich boasts less taste than a Ratner's bargain bucket and considerably less\nsubtlety. In a fit of fervent per v appeal,\nKen guides his characters through the\nnegligible plot with his traditional light\ntouch and s a voir faire. Although Huggy\nBear, yes, Huggy Bear, does show up.\nSequels department : Nightmare On Elm Street VI : Freddy's Dead hmm\nyes bet that's a good film. Freddy, aka\nRobert Englund, also brings us 976-Evil\nII which might be a good movie. And\nthen again it might not. First one's a pile\nof donkey do. Staying with the Horror\nmotif, Child's Play III will be out later\nthis year. Alas, poor Chucky, I knew him\nwell. First one was excellent, second one\ndidn't feature the mother from the first\nfilm, and was pretty damn crap; this one\ndoesn't even star the original kid..\nFX2 stretches credibility with what is\npractically a remake of the original,\nwhich we doubt will be particularly\nentertaining twice.\nThe Completely Hopeless Cases\nDepartment : What Empire wittily called\n'the least eagerly awaited sequel in recent\nyears': Mannequin II, same story,\ndifferent people. Which leaves only the\nquestion : will it still have a Starship\nsoundtrack? Why? Who commissioned\nthis film?\nAnd finally : The Grand Turkey Of\nThem All: Return To The Blue Lagoon.\nSomehow the son of the original couple\nhas been careless enough to get himself\nstranded on another desert island, but not\nso careless that he doesn't have the\ncompany of a nubile young lady. What\ncan we say?\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nThe Staff on the\nThe Case for\nthe Prosecution\nYou should be careful what you wish for.\nWhen Chris failed his exams, the whole\nstaff wanted an editor. Instead we got\nAndy. He is believed not actually to exist,\nbut is instead a projection of all the staff's worst nightmares. Constantly surrounded\nby a cloud of fags and empty Dog bottles,\nhe sweeps through the office threatening\nto give people as lapp in' or a kick in' for\nno apparent reason. Talking of reasons,\nwe still wonder why he actually stood for\nthe post. After drawing a couple of\ncartoons, and doing a bit of collating, he\nsuddenly found himself in charge of\nproducing 4,000 copies of a magazine\nevery week. The only explanation he has\never given is that it would be 'al arf. My,\nhow we lar fed. Things did not start well when most of\nthe staff did not come back from holiday\nfor the first issue. In a fit of madness, the\nfeatures editor (who hasn't been seen for\nthe whole of the summer term!) suggested\na cover, and Andy's bum was printed\n4,000 times, in red. In panic, the staff\nreturned, and while they tried to bring\nthe style back to normal, Andy proceeded\nto try and write the entire magazine\nhimself. The odd cartoon, massive\neditorials and endless features on the\nAndy's second love (the first being\nhimself), comics began to dominate the\nmagazine. Staff were resigning in droves.\nBy the Valentine's Issue he had\ndiscovered the standard excuse 'I'm not a sabbatical and I 've got exams' and\ndisappeared for two weeks. The litho\nbroke down in despair, along with the\nstaff. The printer and print unit manager\ngot drunk, and various staff members\nfound themselves in overnight paste up\nsessions. To complete a perfect week, it\nstarted snowing. This may also have been\nAndy's fault.\nAfter a particularly late night's collating\nhe declared his intention to have FELIX\nfinished by the time the pubs shut. He\ndidn't specify on which day or in which\ntime zone. In recent weeks it has become\napparent that he meant Monday, although\nit's been a close thing recently.\nThe subtle distinction between reality\nand fantasy is non-existent in the\nbyzantine labyrinths of Our Darling\nEditor's mind. The personal computer in\nthe office has a city simulation game on\nit, and boy is he PISSED OFF if anybody\nreleases earthquakes, floods, godzilla s and\nair crashes on it when he's not looking.\nAnd as everybody knows, when Bagpuss\nplays computer games, all the mice on\nthe mouse organ fall asleep. Whilst\ndeadlines heroically slip by, and the\nmadness unfolds, what is Andy doing? Is\nhe in his room studiously revising? Is he\ncatching up on his course work? Is he\njollying on the staff? Is he typesetting,\npasting, brom i ding or writing editorials? Is\nVal Doonican a real hip guy? The answer\nis cruel but true.\nAnother favorite pastime is often played\nas collating sessions wear on. When\neverybody else wants to get finished and\ncollapse into bed, Andy looks for a verbal\nfight. Collating is forgotten as tempers\nrise and contradict ary statements fly. It\ndoesn't matter what the subject or the\nangle, Andy always has the last word, of\ncourse (see Editor on staff!).\nHis latest psychological disorder stems\nfrom the Life Sci ball. Ever since he\nattended this event he has been claiming\nto be a celestial avatar of sex god. This is\nbased on the fact that he believes that\npeople spent the evening telling him how\ngorgeous he looked in his Tux. He was\ntoo drunk to realise they were in fact\ntelling him how 'gargoyle'-o us he looked.\nHe has an overdraft larger than most\nthird world debts, a waistline to match\nand turns into an amoeba at the sight of\na spl iff. As the saying goes 'The spirit is\nwilling but the flesh is weak (and flabby)'.\nThe Felix staff's confidence in Andy\n'the' Butcher was seconded only by the\nrelief of the Union staff and sabbaticals';\nrelief in knowing that their incompetence\n44\nEditor,\nwould not be recognised given the sheer\nincompetence present in Mr Butcher's Gotham-warped mind. The faith of the\nUnion Social Colours committee was also\nin evidence. 'Votes for...?', '...and those\nagainst?', 'that's a far greater number'.\nAndrew very rarely takes things in the\n\u2022spirit in which they are intended. He will\nprobably succumb to suicidal thoughts on\nreading this article. Every editor has been\ns lagged off by his staff in the final issue\nof each year. The difference is, up until\nnow, the staff haven't meant it.\nAnd what of the future? Mr Butcher has\nexpressed a desire to edit London Student\n- the rag of the University of London\nUnion in a year or so. Interested parties\nare rubbing their hands in glee at this\nthought. We've been looking for an\nexcuse to shut London Student down for'\nyears...\nThe immediate future for Andy is a return to the life sciences division. Well\nprobably not, given that he has done less\nfor his course than for Felix. Rumours\nthat his examination pass will be\ndelivered to him by Lord Lucan riding\nShergar are said to be completely\nunfounded, but quite possible nonetheless.\nAnd just before we finish, as Andy\nalways complains about being crit i sized behind his back, this time it's in black\nand white, and read in 2750 Felices.\nThe hottest head, a temper vastly\nquicker than his paste-ups or editorials,\nmore quirky than Bill Goodwin: Andrew\nButcher, you're going down.\nThe Case for\nthe Defence\nBeing the first non-sabbatical Felix editor\nsince 1974 put Andy in a very difficult\nposition. Editing Felix is a time\nconsuming job, and mixing this with an\nattempt to save a degree that was\nalready spiralling into oblivion was a nearly impossible task. There was no way\nthat he could be in the office enough to\ngive the staff the sort of guidance they\nneed (individually us staff are quite\ncompetent, but in groups we tend to\nassume a sheep-like quality, needing to\nbe reminded to sleep, for example).\nHe was torn between his course and\nFelix, feeling an obligation to do both,\nand finding himself doing neither. Editing\na magazine when you have only eight\nhours work a week is hard enough, but\ndoing a full-blown science course takes\nthings beyond the realms of possibility.\nThe problems really started about his\nAfter two terms of command under\nAndy 'the' Butcher the staff of Felix\nair their views and reveal the truth\nbehind the man in charge.\n9\nFELIX\nfourth and fifth issues. Various tensions\naround the office came to head, as Andy\neffect iv ly had to take two weeks off to do\nhis exams. As a result staff found\nthemselves doing much more work which\ninterfered with their course work. Some\nhad to resign. This in its turn had the\neffect of starting to break up the 'family\nspirit' that is, too a large extent, the\ndriving spirit behind Felix. Course\npressures, and in one case, starting to\nedit another college's paper, led to the\ndeparture of many of the general purpose\nstaff, leading to a team mainly concerned\nwith their own sections. The magazine\nteam had become more insular with few\npeople willing to just do past-ups.\nAndy found things more and more^\nfrustrating, and as he received less help,\nhe began to lose interest in Felix. Things\nreached a head when virtually all of the\nremaining staff went on strike on a Thursday night, with half of Felix still to\nbe printed. Production of Felix had\nbecome virtually impossible.\nWhile he really had started out with\ngood intentions, the mountains he had to\nscale were nearly insurmountable. Despite\nthis, for much of the time Felix was\nbigger than last year's. And he really is\nquite a good blok e. And he reads (fairly)\ngood comics and ... um ... he bought me\na drink once and err...\nThe moral of this tale is not that Andy\nis a completely useless editor, but rather\nthat to have a non-sabbatical Felix editor\nis virtually impractical. Andy took on a shit job, with little idea of what he was\ngetting into, and very little experience of\nthe job. Is it any surprise that things went\nwrong? Thanks for trying Andy.\n15\n\n"

This\nhowever was not going to get in my way\nof getting to the place on time. Troopers\ncome and troopers go, but only true\ntroopers know how to know. With a piping hot cup of coffee on the way I prepared to talk to Damon, one half of\nPierre Etoile, which means 'rock star' in\nFrench, and ex-one third of Galaxie 500.\nHe's over from Noo Yawk to promote his\nlatest sonic al sound s cup ture( my clich e, not his) which is why we are seated in\nthe Rough Trade interview room and we\njust let the conversation flow.\nSo how did this all come about?\nIt's just a little side project that we (we\nbeing Damon and Naomi who is the other\nhalf of the band and also used to be in\nGalaxie 500) had done which was already\nscheduled for release before Galaxie 500\nsplit up. We were getting ready to do an\ninterview for the band and we came back\nfrom our last European tour and Dean\nsaid he didn't want to do an EP after all\nand he wanted a break. Looking back it\nwas an ominous sign, but he was really\nkeen that we should do it. I think he\ndidn't want to hold us up. It's just a three\ntrack EP of quiet intimate songs in the\nspirit of solo records like Johnathan \" \u2022\nRichman and Alex Chilton.\nWhy did Galaxie 500 split?\nDean quit, for reasons only he knows. It's very unclear to us.\nEven though the three were old\nfriends Dean isn't talking to them\nanymore and they have had no\ncontact since the split.\nWas it a sudden thing?\nYeah, it was straight out of the blue. He\nsaid it had just gotten to be too much\nwork, just like a job.'\nPrior to their split Galaxie 500 were\nreceiving more critical success than at\nany time previously and they were\nespecially popular in Germany and\nDamon thinks that this had a lot to do\nwith it (being popular, not necessarily\nbeing big in Germany). In the past New\nYork semi-legend Kramer had been the\nfourth member of Galaxie and would play\non some of their records.\nI asked if he had been in vole d with\nthis new record.\nUh no, we produced it ourselves. We\nwanted it to not sound like the band so\nwe did as many things different as we\ncould, like I sang instead of Naomi so that\nit wouldn't sound like Galaxie. But\nKramer was into it and understood why\nwe did what we did.\nThis project is a one-off and Damon\nand Naomi have been looking for\nother people for a new band. Damon\nis enthusiastic:\nOnce we got over the shock of the band\nsplitting up it was kinda exciting. It's going to be a very different sound. It's gotta be radically different though, or it'd just be like Galxie 500 all over again.\nDamon is a teacher in English\nLiterature and is going to have to get\na job upon his return since now\nGalaxie are defunct there's no money\nfrom the band. He also prefers vinyl\nand thinks CDs are too clinical and\nthat the covers of CDs are crap. He\nrates Can and The Soft Machine, and\nso do I so we must be right. We have\na bit of mu so chat about guitars,\nll th s and 13th s and 'Decomposing\nTrees'. What about covers?\nYeah, covering songs is great, because\nyou get into the song and learning\nsomeone else's song is like having\nsomeone else play for you and we will do\nmore in the future.\nHe's mates with Sonic Youth and I tell\nhim how even though I'm a great fan\nof theirs I still managed to fall asleep\nat one of their shows. He thinks this\nis particularly amusing and says that\nthere've been people falling asleep at\ntheir shows but that he understands.\nHe still doesn't see how I managed to\nfall asleep.

NVIRO\nCould you not live with a smaller house,\nwith one or no car per family, with just\none brand of detergent and half your\nplastic equipment? Governments refuse to\ninvest in such policies for future\ngenerations who cannot yet vote.\nThese suggestions might not sound that\nattractive, but then neither is the reality\nthat our continued environmental abuse\nwill create.\nAll the metallic and bulk minerals\nmined so far are still on the Earth's surface. They have not been destroyed\nand still exist, incorporated into discarded\nproducts. Much of our rubbish is made to\nlast and will never decay when disposed\nof in a landfill site. British homes and\nindustry generate 23million tonnes of\nrubbish a year. In 1988 the drinks, food\nand aerosol cans disposed of in Britain\nwould have reached to the moon and\nback, yet we recycle only 1.5% of our\ndomestic waste. In contrast the DDR,\nAustria, Switzerland and parts of the\nUnited States recycle over 10%. In the\nworld of recycling even environmental\nand economic factors support the same\ngoal. There is a95% energy saving when\naluminium is res melted. Every tonne of\nglass recycled saves thirty gallons of oil,\nand half the energy needed is saved\nwhen making paper from waste rather\nthan virgin pulp. Recycling of\nmetal life rous waste dumps and scrap\nheaps is logistically easier, more efficient,\ncheaper and less destructive than mining\nsouth of Cape Horn.\nThat is not to say that present\ntechnology will not permit Antarctic\n\"development\". \"Frontier\" exploration\ncompanies maintain that polar technology\ncurrently employed for Alaskan and\nArctic exploitation could move south\ntomorrow. The relevance of\nArctic/Antarctic comparisons is however\ndebatable and the performance of Arctic\ntechnology in the much harsher regime\nof the southern hemisphere is not\nguaranteed. Ironically pollution clean-up\ntechnology has not kept pace with\nll till \u00ab fe \u201e .\nii J9 \u00bb IP'1\n]\u2014S^ mi . .\nt tW|| B||r \u2122\na priceless continent to preserve\nENYIRO\nexploitation technology. The Exxon\nValdez disaster exposed just how underdeveloped it is. The pathetic clean-up of\nthe coast line consisted of high pressure\nhot water hosing and wiping the rocks\nwith paper towels. It is envisaged that oil\nspilled at sea, where high winds and ice\nexist would probably be impossible to\nrecover or even contain. With Alaskan\ndrilling costs approaching &40 million per\nkilometre and estimates of equivalent\nAntarctic costs nearly three times this\nfigure, such budgets are not justified by\ntodays markets, despite the Gulf crisis.\nInternational energy companies like Du\nPont, the parent company of Conoco,\nprefer to spend their funds on alternative\nenergy research. Unless alternatives are\nfound, the first world's reliance on oil and\nits associated products will surely dictate\nfuture development of our fifth and final\ncontinent.\nDespite such demands which may one\nday exist, few companies would take on\nthe complex geopolitics. Sovereignty\ndisputes, acquisition costs, and royalties\nremain at an unacceptable level.\nThe 15th consultative meeting of the\nAntarctic Treaty, in Paris in 1989, was\ndominated by a proposal put forward by\nAustralia and France that Antarctica be\ndeclared a 'Wilderness Park'. Implicit in\nthis proposal is a ban on all mining and\nstrict regulation of all other human\nactivity on the Continent.\nThis struck a mortal blow to the\ncontroversial 1988 Convention on the\nRegulation of Antarctic Minerals\n(CRAMRA). This convention was the\nculmination of ten years of negotiations.\nIt assumes that at some stage in the\nfuture, mining in Antarctica might\nbecome a reality and allows for future\nexploitation under strict conditions and\nwith the full agreement of all signatories.\nA veto by only one state being sufficient\nto block any mining application.\nDeciding what constitutes minerals\nexploration is central to their proposal.\nAn international secretariat would police\nenvironmental regulations and vet\nproposed geophysical research to ensure\nthat it is not prospecting in disguise.\nA special consultative meeting, to\naccept or overturn CRAMRA in favour of\nthe world park regime, was held in Chile\nin December. However, after three weeks\nthe signatories had failed to find a formula which satisfied both camps.\nThe US, Britain and Japan, still supporting\nCRAMRA, argued that an agreement to\nregulate mining activities is better than a total ban. If commercial pressure for\nresources ever force mining, a ban\ncontains nothing to control it. This is a situation which Mr Richard Laws,\npresident of the Scientific Committee,\nregards as potentially disastrous CRAMRA\nat least imposes strict rules on such\nactivity. Opponents including Australia\nand France maintain that without\nCRAMRA, nations will not even look for\nminerals because land ownership would\nremain impossible. There are now twelve\nmore like minded countries. This year,\npowerful groups in Washington have\npressed the US state department\nnegotiators to forget mining and back the\nidea of a world park.\nBefore April's Madrid meeting, and with\nsupport dwindling, the prospects for\nCRAMRA look grim and the\nimplementation of the world park regime\nseemed likely. Indeed on the seventh day\nof the eight day conference in Madrid\nanother stalemate was imminent.\nHowever, after Japan's defection from the\npro-mining camp, at the eleventh hour, a compromise was reached. Since the Chile\nmeeting Britain had shifted its position,\npushing for a fifty year moratorium and\nJapan now asked for a moratorium on\nmining until such time as technology was\nsufficiently advanced to safeguard the\nenvironment. A blue-print was drawn up\nwhich would ban mining for at least 50\nyears. Treaty nations must now take the\npackage back to their governments for\nfurther consideration before signing in\nMadrid on the 23rd of this month. Head\nof the American delegation, Curtis Bohlen\nsaid the plan represents significant\nconcessions by all the major players. But\nhe pointed out that the opportunity is still\nthere for future generations to lift the ban\nif they choose.\nEven environmentalists are encouraged\nby the agreement, although it falls short\nof their objectives of having Antarctica\ndeclared a world park. What is clear is\nthat the moratorium provides a strong\ndeterrent to mining companies and will\nperhaps ensure the protection of\nAntarctica until at least 2040.\nDespite claims by Mike King, professor\nof petroleum engineering at Imperial\nCollege, (Independent 19th November\n1990) that the oil companies are queuing\nup for exploration licences, it seems that\nthe opposite is true. Robert Horton, (BP\nChairman) stated publicly that \"We have\nno short or long term plans or ambitions\nto explore for oil, gas or minerals in the\nAntarctic\", (Independent 23rd November\n1990). Both RTZ and Shell remain totally\nimpartial about the outcome of the Chile\ntalks and would be happy to abide by the\nlaws of a world park.\nWhether a conservation park or not,\nextreme economic and political reasons\ncan force mining in the most unlikely of\nplaces. The Siberian coal mining industry\nhas not been a profit making venture\nsince its birth. It is still heavily subsidized\nby the government in an attempt to\nsynthesize employment in the region. The\ndetrimental effects of mining PGE, (so\nimportant for controlling global industrial\npollution) may be offset by its benefits\nof helping to preserve the Antarctic ice\nsheet. Alternatively, as Dr. Willan points\nout, future demands may be satisfied by\ndiverting the 50% of the PGE annual\nworld consumption from jewellery and\nspeculative hoarding s. Although our current resources are\nsufficient to support our forever hungry\nspecies, what problems of supply will the\nnext century bring? Antarctica may\nbecome an important frontier simply\nbecause it is the last frontier. The future\nof Antarctic mineral resources depends\non a great many unknowns. What\nconstitutes \"ore\" in the future will change\nwith advances in exploitation, mining\ntechnology and demand. But until these\nare more adequately defined, forecasts\nremain as speculative as the Antarctic\nmineral resources themselves.\n\n"

    "content": "This is probably my last report as\nPresident before handing over to Zoe\nHellinger. The allegation often made by\nthe Rector is that Union sabbaticals are\nunrepresentative. The Union has tried to\ndemonstrate that this is not always the\ncase. In particular, we have tried to\ngauge student opinion on such issues as\nthe college day and student rents. We\neven undertook a market research\nexercise - the first on such a large scale\nin ICU history. What follows is completely\nunrepresentative - it is personal.\nConstituent College Unions\nIf Imperial College was to be recreated,\nCCUs would play no part in it. The\nvariety of CCUs is interesting in itself. St\nMary's is probably the most with-it CCU.\nIt generally represents its members and\nforms a good social forum for the medics\nto meet. However this would probably be\ntrue of any CCU which found itself\nisolated on a different site. Of the other\nCCUs, there is little else in their favour.\nCity and Guilds performs some useful role\nacademically, as it did when the threat of\nACGIs being awarded outside of IC came\nup. Socially, they satisfy little need that\nisn't already catered for by the Union\nmain body. The Royal School of Mines\ndoes little academically - its Academic\nAffairs Officer has done nothing this year\n- and generally gets a reputation for\npissing it up in the bar every night. The\nRSMU completely wipes out every effort\nmade by the college to promote women\nin science and engineering. And the\nRCSU? The biggest laugh is left until last.\nRCSU may well represent its members\nacademically - its Academic Affairs\nOfficer has done a good job this year -but the majority of RCSU are people who\ncouldn't muster half a course unit\nbetween them. Some of them, of course\nmean very well. But the majority of\npeople within the RCSU office are wasters\nwho have failed exams and are too\nfrightened to face the real world. Suzanne\nAhmet, in particular, had ideas about\neliminating the random s from the office\nthis year. She has failed in that\nendeavour - not least of which because\nshe failed to appreciate the ethos that\nexists of RCS being for a select bunch\norganising events for themselves. A complete waste of a union block grant.\nAngie Creissen has stacks to do next\nyear.\nUL U The University of London Union is\npossibly the worst waste of money in the\nwhole of the country's academic expense.\nSet up to provide additional services not\ncatered for by host unions, it performs\nlittle or none of this function. At the\nheart of ULU is a policy making body\nknown as GUC. GUC is the worst case of\ncommittee destruction known to mankind.\nIt forms working parties to discuss the\npurchase of a new ULU minibus (ICU\nbought one overnight), it attempts to\ndonate money to charitable causes (illegal\nunder attorney general guidelines), it\nrepresents no-one but a select band of\nfollowers. In principle ULU should work,\nin practice it is a meaningless\norganisation whose sole raison d'e tre is\nICU PRESIDENT\nUNOFFICIAL REPORT: SHAN'S LAST RANT the management training of political\nactivists and the provision of junkets for\nits sabbaticals.\nCOUNCIL\nICU Council has met this year at regular\nintervals. In this time, the majority of\nmembers have had little or nothing to say\nabout any of the topics debated. Council\nhas been dominated this year by three\nsabbaticals and about three other officers.\nVirtually every idea put forward by a sabbatical has been passed unanimously\nbecause of the blind faith council has\nplaced in its sabbaticals. On only one\nissue has there been any sort of debate -the question of market research. Whilst\nthe idea of this was sound and probably\nthe best thing the Union was proposing in\na very long time, the execution of this\nidea was awful. Council should have\ndeferred the proposal pending further\ndebate - they didn't. Council is a managing body with full powers of\ndebate. It has discarded those powers this\nyear.\nCOLLEGE The year 1990/91 has been the year of\nthe accountant. Balance sheets play a larger factor in the decision-making\nprocess at IC than ever before. In order\nfor IC to survive in an increasingly\ncompetitive market, fiscal policy has to\nplay as big a role as academic policy, but\nmust never overtake it.\nStaff morale within IC has never been at\nits worst. There have been mass\nredundancies within college, and at the\nsame time a recruitment drive for\nmanagers and directors. We now have\nmanagers and directors of Estates,\nDevelopment, Marketing, Personnel,\nFinance. The college is in danger of\nhaving too many chiefs and not enough\nIndians. At the Rector's question time a few weeks ago, points were raised on the\nissue of mass early retirements within the\nEstates section. Estates has a huge\npersonnel problem within college. The\nblame for this must be partly shouldered\nby its big chief - Gordon Marshall - the\nDirector of Estates.\nGordon Marshall has upset a large\nnumber of employees in his time at\ncollege. In particular he has the amazing\nability of being able to bullshit himself\nout a corner. All year he has denied to me\nthat he had anything to do with the farce\nsurrounding the purchase of the\nClayponds development and the sale of\nMontpelier Hall:\n-He has continually stated\nthat he was not employed by the college\nat the time that the two were debated.\nGordon Marshall was employed by the\ncollege at the time. He was retained as a building consultant by Imperial College in\nJuly of last year. He attended the\ngovernor's meeting that discussed the\npurchase of Clayponds back in July.\nGordon Marshall has misled every\ncommittee this year on which he has\ndenied his involvement with the\nClayponds deal. The further denial\nrelating to the Clayponds/Montpelier saga\nis that the two were not related. How\ncould any competent businessman\nadvocate buying a property for SM11\nwith no source of funding other than a bank loan? A senior administrator within\nSherfield told me that he had shown the\nresidence balance sheet to someone in\nthe real world (i.e. industry). The reply\nwas that whoever was ultimately\nresponsible for Clayponds should have\nbeen sacked for gross mismanagement\nand sued in the high court. A simple\nadmission from the top echelons of\nCollege would suffice - Okay hands up,\nwe got it wrong. Instead we have seen a cover-up.\nMr Marshall has been aided and abetted\nby his right hand woman Sheelagh\nCrampton nee Patrick. Mrs Crampton has\nfluttered her eyelids this year whenever\nin a tight corner. She even rang Gordon\nMarshall in the south of France when the\ngoing got tough on negotiating rents with\nWilson House, the St Mary's hall of\nresidence. Mrs Crampton is an evasive\nwoman and will fit in well with the\ncurrent management style.\nThe tide is turning within college. Staff\nare openly criticising Gordon Marshall for\nhis management style. His -briefings to\nValerie Straw, his facilities manager, are\nflawed, as she has found to her cost. On\ntwo occasions this year, she has arrived\nat college committees (Parking & Traffic\nand College Athletics) to present papers,\nonly to find that her brief is incorrect.\nAs for the academics, they are the\nunhappiest of all. Heads of department\ngenerally feel that the college now views\nthe academics as a support service for the\nadministration, instead of the opposite\nway round. Decisions affecting academic\nstaff are now being made at\nadministration level - not even via the\nManagement Planning Group, the\nunofficial 'advisory' panel headed by the\nRector. Poor old Eric Ash probably isn't aware of what Sherfield is doing half the\ntime.\nThe MPG has also lost its credibility.\nFormally an advisory body, it now makes\nmedium level policy, seemingly with\nautonomy from Governing Body. A senior\nacademic told me that MPG is a body\n'made up of suits with Angus Fraser at\nthe head of the table, Donald Duck on his\nleft and Mickey Mouse on his right.'\nThe future of Imperial College is bleak.\nThe huge debt is mounting, staff morale\nis at its lowest, students are finding the\nLondon Factor too much of a disincentive\nto come to this 'centre of excellence' . If\npresent trends continue, IC will be a well\noiled machine in ten years time, returning\na large surplus. But the academic\nreputation will be shot to ribbons. IC will\nbe another institution catering for\nresearch students. One year ago, I wrote\nin the fresher's handbook that the\nconcept of IC becoming a postgraduate\ninstitution was a nightmare. In ten years\ntime, that nightmare may well be a reality.\n\n"

The\nreasons for this are complicated and are\nnot only a function of the reforms\nthemselves, but also the speed with which\nthey have been implemented and the\nfailure of the systems that have been\ndevised to support them.\nThe reforms combine a number of\nideas, perhaps too many. There is an\nattempt, building on work that was\ncarried out prior to the reforms being\nintroduced, to improve the management\nof the resources within the NHS. The\nResource Management Initiative came\ninto being in 1986 when six pilot sites\nwere established, and is concerned with\nall the resources used by the NHS, such\nas nurses, clinicians, laboratory services,\ndrugs, beds and even the finance\ndepartment. The initiative aims \"to allow\ntotal and individual patient care (and its\nquality) to be planned, delivered and\ncosted more effectively\" (Ian Mills,\nDirector of Resource Management, NHS\nManagement Executive, February 1989).\nThe NHS has for some time controlled\nand planned its functional costs (such as\nnursing or laboratory services) and has\nhad a good idea of the total costs of\nparticular disciplines, such as geriatrics or\northopaedics, within a hospital. From this,\nit has calculated an average cost for\ntreating each patient, but this takes no\naccount of the complexity of different\ncases. It has only been within the last\ncouple of years that the NHS has been\nable to find out how much a hip\nreplacement operation using one\ntechnique costs compared to using\nanother technique.\nClearly any industry that ran itself on\nthe basis of not knowing how much more\nits cost to make one product rather than\nanother would have soon found itself out\nof business. While the views that \"there is\nan infinite demand for free healthcare in\nthis country\" and that \"the NHS is a cash-limited service\" both oversimplify the\nposition, it is true that we could spend an\never increasing amount of money on\nhealthcare, by trying to achieve a perfect\nstate of health for the entire population,\nand that, even if we turned over the\nentire gross national product to the NHS,\nwe would still run out of money at some\npoint. The resource management\ninitiative tries to offer some kind of\nmeasure of 'treatment effectiveness' by\nlooking at the different resources used to\ntry and treat different cases.\nThis scenario often causes people to\nthrow up their hands in horror in the\nbelief that patients will now only be\ncured if the treatment is deemed 'cost-effective' or will receive poorer quality of\ncare because it is cheaper. This is not\nentirely true, and the NHS Management\nExecutive, which has day-to-day\noperational control of the NHS (as distinct\nfrom the Department of Health)\nrecognised this in the statement by lan\nMills quoted above which mentions\nquality. Another strand of the reforms is\n'clinical audit'. There is no clear definition\nof clinical or medical audit, but it involves\nlooking at different aspects of the\npatient's treatment and evaluating their\neffectiveness in terms such as recovery of\nfunction (for example, mobility in a broken arm which has been set and then\ntreated with physiotherapy).\nIn fact, audit has become rather a buzz\nword in the NHS and the NationalAudit\nOffice and the Audit Commission are\ncarrying out a series of studies in the\nNHS on the effectiveness of many of its\norganizational structures, such as supplies\nand pathology services. Sadly, most of\nthese reports have been, at their most\nkind, scathing.\nThe third strand of the reforms, and the\none which has caused most controversy,\nis the 'internal market'. This divides the\nNHS into 'provider' organisations, which\noffer services such as particular\noperations, and 'purchasers', who buy\nthese services for the population they\nmust supply with healthcare. The\npurchasers mainly consist of district\nhealth authorities, which serve a local\npopulation, together with fund holding GPs, who control their own purchasing\nbudget to buy healthcare for the patients\non their list rather than simply expecting\nthe district to pick up the cost of referrals\nas in the traditional system.\nPurchasers may also include hospitals\nthat decide not to provide a particular\nservices themselves (for example, a specialty such as orthopaedics) and\ninstead subcontract another hospital to\nprovide those services for them. Amongst\nthe providers are the Trust hospitals,\nwhich have been given self-governing\nstatus, independent from the DHA in\nwhose district they lie. The Trust\nhospitals have been one of the major\nsources of political argument, especially\nthe allegations after the Monmouth by-election that Labour 'lied' during that\ncampaign by describing the Trust\nhospitals as having 'opted out'.\nPurchasers and providers draw up\ncontracts between them agreeing the type\nof service to be supplied (such as a hip\nreplacement), the number, the cost of\neach operation and levels of service, such\nas maximum waiting time for an\noperation. Here the concepts of resource\nmanagement, clinical audit and\ncontracting meet, since it is clearly\nnecessary for providers to be able to cost\neach type of operation and prove its\neffectiveness so that purchasers can\nbalance price and quality in placing their\ncontracts.\nHere is the first area in which the\nreforms have foundered. Despite the\nresource management initiative, and\ndespite the fact that the NHS\nManagement Executive were forced to\nroll out the project to all the acute\nhospitals in England before the pilots\nwere finished or evaluated (a move which\nhas been highly criticized by the team\nfrom Brunei University which evaluated\nthe pilots), most providers still have little\nidea what their services cost them and\nwhat to charge for them. To avoid\ncomplete confusion, the Department of\nHealth also effectively ordered districts to\ncontinue to place contracts with those\nproviders who had historically served\nthem. Thus the internal market has been\n'fixed' in its first year, a move which sits\noddly with this government's policy of\nfree marketeering.\nThe avowed intention of these free\nmarket e ers was that \"the money would\nfollow the patient\". Yet, unless the district\nin which the patient lives has a contract\nwith the hospital to which the GP wishes\nto refer them, they can no longer be\nreferred there. The truth of the matter is\nthat \"the patient follows the contract\".\nThis is the case even with fund holding GPs, since they too must make contracts\nand are not as free to \"shop around\" as\nthe government would like us to believe.\nThe reforms also appear to have taken\nno thought for the problems of paying for\npatients who fall ill when away from\nhome and are treated by GPs or hospitals\noutside their own district. In London,\nespecially, this is likely to cause a major\nheadache.\nAt the beginning of this article, it was\nsuggested that the failure of the reforms\nwas not only due to problems inherent in\nthe underlying philosophy and errors\nthrown up in the formulation of policy\nand strategy from that philosophy, but\nalso a result of the speed with which they\nwere put in place. This haste has given\nlittle time for trials to be carried out, and\nhas not allowed the lessons learnt in\nthose trials to be incorporated in the\nnational scheme. It has also allowed\ninsufficient time for the systems\nsupporting the reforms to be developed,\nput in place and tested. This is\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nWell, here it is, the last issue of Felix for this\nacademic year. Surprisingly enough that means\nthat this will be my last editorial (isn't logic a wonderful thing), at least for a little while.\nHowever, before you all burst into tears at my\npassing, in the great tradition of editors\neverywhere, I 've still got a few things left to\nsay.\nMost of these are things that have been\nlurking belligerently around in the area at the\nback of my brain where belligerent things like\nto lurk for quite some time, and there just\nhasn't been the chance to write them before.\nThe rest are just feelings and opinions and\nsumming s up of my time as an editor. But let's deal with alu rker first...\nNon-Sabbatical Editorship, and other things\nI wouldn't wish on my worst enemy...\nFor this year I 've been the first non-s abb editor\nin quite a while, and the main thing I'd like to\nsay about it is that it sucks. If I'd had half the\nsense that evolution (or God, depending on\nyour view of things) saw fit to bestow on the\ncommon earthworm, then I would have\nresigned after the first couple of weeks.\nBasically the job of Felix Editor is far too big\nfor someone who is unable to devote all their\ntime towards it, regardless of how much help\nthey have. Even with an extra member of\nstaff, as we had this year, it just won't work. It\nis still the editor who is ultimately responsible\nand everyone, despite all their misgivings and\nsane feelings to the contrary, continues to look\nto him or her to make the decisions, organise\nthe whole thing, and sometimes, unbelievably,\nfor advice and encouragement (mad, aren't they?). So if the person concerned can't be in\nthe office all the time, and even when they are\noften can't give Felix their full attention\nbecause they're worrying about their course,\netc, the whole system breaks down.\nI'm not saying that it was only the situation\nthat has been to blame for many of the\nproblems that Felix has had this year. As I 've\nalready mentioned in my piece on the staff,\nseveral people haven't acted in the way which\n1 think would have been ideal (ho hum). On\ntop of this I 've been far from blameless myself,\nand several things that have gone wrong have\nhad at least some grounding in me, and\nseveral have been entirely my own fault.\nHowever, I feel that even the most organised,\nhard-working, even-tempered and generally\nsaint-like example of the perfect editor still\nwould not be able to overcome the innate\nproblems of being a non-s abb. Basically it's just too much. In order to give\nFelix the attention it needs and deserves of its\neditor, you would have to sacrifice your\ncourse, and vice- versa. There isn't any way to\nfind a middle road that will allow you to do\nboth well. In future the Union should bear this\n. in mind, and while I appreciate that there\nwasn't much else they could have done in the\ncircumstances, they really shouldn't allow the\nsame thing to happen twice. Felix needs an\neditor, and it needs one that can devote all\ntheir time to it, otherwise they won't be able\nto do justice to the job, to themselves,\nand.most importantly, to Felix itself.\nStudents of the College unite?\nMore shady lurking, I'm afraid, this time to do\nwith our beloved Union, and the people In\" charge thereof. Several people have\ncommented this year that I have on occasions\nbeen very soft on the Union, and generally\nhaven't maintained the near-tradition of pitting\nFelix against 'them upstairs'. This is true.\nNo, I'm not about to admit to being a snivelling lackey of the Union by claiming that\nthey haven't actually done anything wrong, or\nthat they are the most wonderful Union\nOfficials ever. The reason why I'm not going to\nadmit to it is because it's not true.\nHowever, I do have an explanation. I came\ninto this job not really knowing much about\nthe internal workings of College or the Union.\nHowever, I did know that a lot of people seem\nto find a great deal of amusement in whiling\naway their time by moaning about the Union. I also realised quite quickly that College\nadministration are continually trying to change\nthings here, and often in a way that could be\nor in fact are bad for us students.\nI also realised that the only student body\nwith the power to try to stop this kind of thing\nhappening are the Union. For example, the\nproposed extension of the College Day, and\nthe ridiculous rent increases proposed for next\nyear were both fought by the Union, and in\nboth cases students ended up a lot better off.\nIt seems to me that most of the so-called\n'problems' with the Union result from the fact\nthat not enough people actually get involved.\nIt's all well and good to sit on your backsides,\nadmire your digital watches/stare at your pint,\nand slag off the Union, but nothing is going to\nchange if more students don't start seeing the\nUnion for what it is: A group of people who\nare there to represent OUR views to College,\nand to serve US.\nAs, typically enough, the average apathetic\nstudent seems to be unable to realise this for\nhim/herself, I have been attempting to get this\nidea across via my editorials. Hence my lack of\ncomplaints about the Union. It would be no\ngood me propounding their virtues and\nattempting to raise peoples awareness of 'them\nupstairs' if I then turn around and give them a good s lagging for some minor annoyance or\npathetic cock-up. I'm not saying they haven't made any, because they have. However, they\nhave also worked very hard; almost as hard as\nthe Felix staff, which is about the highest\ncommendation I give to anybody.\nNeither do I want to give the impression that\nFelix is the mouthpiece of the Union, because\nit isn't, and never has been (or will be). I just\nfeel that both the Union and Felix are here to\nrepresent and serve students. I also feel that to\nencourage interaction with the Union benefits\nfar more students than reducing the already\nlow faith in a group of people who, for this\nyear at least, have done a lot of work, and in\nan institution that is vital to us, and has the\npotential to do so much more than it does, if\nonly people would take an interest.\nEvil Tyrants, Nasty Plans, Accountants and\nManagement Structures\nQuite a short bit, just for a change, as the\nupper tiers of College have been covered in\nvarious other articles in this issue (I'm talking\nspecifically of Shan's Bit - give it a read).\nSuffice it say that in my innocent idealism and\nnaivety 1 used to believe that the big boys\nover at College had as their primary concern\nthe quality of our education, and the\ncontinuing academic standards of our college.\nI was wrong. I have attempted to show just\nwhat kind of things actually go on, and how\nmuch sneak in ess, backstabbing, dubious\naccountancy, and plain old incompetence there\nis 'over there'. Unfortunately, 1 don't think I 've\neven managed to scratch the surface.\nI just hope that Adam can do better next\nyear. There are a lot of things that go on over\nthere that they'd rather we didn't know, but\nwe'd probably be a lot better off if we did. At\nleast then we might be able to have a say in\nour futures.\n'Regrets, I 've had a few...'\nI don't regret having been Felix Editor.\nHowever, in my own eyes I have not done\njustice to Felix, to my course, or to myself, and\nthis 1 do regret. I know that 1 could have done\na better job, and not all of the problems were\nto do with being a non-s abb. But that's just the\nbreaks.\nI would like to apologise to all the people\nthat I 've managed to annoy over the past few\nmonths, for whatever reason, especially those\nwho haven't deserved it (ie the staff). There\nhave been times when I 've been surprised that\nthey haven't murdered me...\n...He's coming around the final bend (and\nhe's in front of all the people behind\nhim)...\nSo there you have it: My last editorial (well,\nnot including this bit). I'm afraid 1 feel a bout\nof that horrible affliction that affects all Oscar\nwinners and Editors in their last issue - The\ngratuitous thank yous...\nFirstly, a massive thankyou to all the staff,\nboth for all the hard work, and for putting up\nwith me as well as you have. I'd like to thank\nall the contributors and colla tors: Without you\nguys and gals Felix would have been in even\nmore trouble than he was when I got elected.\nAlso huge hugs and kisses to all the people\nwho've ever said to me 'Good editorial' or\n'Nice issue this week' or 'The cartoon was\nfunny' or anything like that, and all those\npeople who are in college at very silly hours of\nthe morning when I distribute Felix, and pick\nup a copy as soon as I put them down. Last\nbut by no means least (don't you just love\nclich es?) all of you who have ever read a copy\nof Felix this year.

This\nwill further reduce the divide between\nImperial College and Imperial College pic.\nAlready the London School of Economics\nand University College have considered\ncharging tuition fees. IC's own\nManagement School has increased it's course fees for the MBA in Management\nfrom \u00a33,500 to \u00a34,500.\nAs well as cutting funding to\nuniversities, the Government this year has\nintroduced the Student Loan. This is\nintended to offset the depreciation of\ngrants which have been frozen at last\nyear's level. However, by the beginning\nof November only 200 students had\napplied. Was this due to the general\napathy that haunts IC or due to a massed\noutcry against this twisted system? In\ntandem with the loans came the Access\nFund, a Government safety net for\nimpoverished students. Mr Cullen, who\nmanaged both schemes, tried valiantly to\ngive away \u00a3259,400, receiving just 220\napplications at first, rising to 560 after a campaign in Felix. Next year Mr Cullen\nhopes to have more to give out and\nthought that more students would apply.\nThese grants aren't to offset the loss of\nhousing benefit are they?\nThe Union\nThe Union has been fairly quiet this year,\nwith only a few major cock-ups. The first\nmajor hiccup came when a giant marquee\nwas erected on the Queen's Lawn for the\nCareers Fair. Setbacks aside, the Fair was\na runaway success in all ways except\nfinancial. The fair made a small loss in\n50\ncomparison with the substantial' surplus it\nmade last year, but this was due to a change in organisation and added facilities\nto the companies who attended.\nAn even bigger c langer was dropped to\nthe tune of \u00a35,500 due to\nmal administration both in the Union and\nthe College over the 'big gig' which was\ndue to be held in the Careers Fair's marquee the next weekend. On the day\nthe marquee wasn't used, there wasn'ta bar extension, the support band pulled\nout and publicity was poor. The ticket\nprice spiraled down from the original \u00a37,\nand ended up free. Even so, only 350\npeople attended to see the ever trendy\nDr. and the Medics. Fortunately, the gigs\nlater in the year were more successful\nand attracted a fair crowd.\nThe Snack-bar (aka the 'Lounge Bar'\naka the Caterpillar Cafe ) has been refitted again during the year, this time\nwith some success. Although the\nconversion to dark blue carpet and pink\nwalls cost around \u00a38,000, the\nestablishment broke even for the first\ntime in four years. The change started\nwell, with a new selection of bap s( Chicken Tikka anyone?) and pastries.\nThe latter, however, are overpriced and\nthe finesse that went into the first menus\nseems to have fallen into the familiar\n'there's chilli or some ve a i mush'.\nFurther work planned for the summer\nthat should make entering the toilets less\nof an ordeal and revamp the Union office,\nis the first stage of an attempt to make\nstudents feel part of the Union. The aim\nis to create a hub of activities to which a student may turn for entertainment. This\nwould provide a reason for students to\ncome to the Union building, eat some\nfood in the Union Lounge-bar, watch a film courtesy of the Union's Film Society\nand social is e over a drink from the Union\nbar. Just by being in the Union building,\npeople would then find out where to\ncome for help with any part of student\nlife. Many people do not realise that there\nis a Union welfare service and that the\nUnion is not only there to provide a huge\nrange of clubs and activities but also to\nadvise and represent students on a wide\nrange of issues.\nSpending money on cosmetic changes,\nhowever, is the easy part. To produce a caring face, some radical changes will\nhave to be made in the day to day\nrunning and the unfriendly, closed\natmosphere found at present. The insular\nnature of many segments of the Union\nhas been building up for many years and\nchange will be a painful and difficult\nprocess. In addition, if the functions are\nrun only to the standard seen so far,\nramshackle and badly coordinated, the\nincreasingly sophisticated student will\nturn to the well organised events\navailable in London.\nChanging of staff and attitudes has\nstarted this year with new staff being\nappointed to over half the professional .\nposts in the Union. This has already had an effect, with Mandy Hurford, the new\nUnion Manager, instigating the successful\nchanges seen in the Snack-bar. She is the\ndriving force behind many of the changes\nmooted above.\nThe face of the Union certainly\nchanged with the retirement of Jen\nHardy- Smith who was at the centre of\nthe Union for 17 years. With new faces in\nboth the finance and administrative\nsections of the Union, there may be a better tolerance to change and\nreappraisal of the purpose of the Union.\nVisitors to Mickey Mouse land\nThe College has been overwhelmed with\nvisitors this year, including Margaret\nThatcher who opened the new Centre for\nPopulation Biology at Silwood Park as her\nfirst official engagement since her\nresignation.\nConSoc invited many conservatives,\nsuch as Cecil Parkinson and Edwina\nCurrie to speak to them and The Socialist\nWorkers Student Society and ICU Labour\nClub did likewise, inviting Tony Benn and\nJeremy Corby n, another Labour MP. Why they don't ever want the other side' to\ntalk to them I don't know.\nAnother event, which might have been\nof wide interest to students was the\nSchrodinger lecture which this year\nfeatured Professor Mandelbrot. The\nlecture was originally to be held in the\nGreat Hall, as usual, but when this venue\nwas over subscribed it was relocated in\nthe last week to the Westminster Central\nHall. It is a pity that the extra capacity\nwas not widely advertised as the larger\nvenue was only half filled, and not many\nof those attending were students. College\nclearly could not be bothered to\nencourage students to attend even though\nthis was a topic which can arouse interest\nin even the most apathetic soul.\nActs of God - Fire and Flood\nThe halls of residence are becoming\ndangerous placed to live. In Weeks Hall,\na kamikaze wall heater destroyed the\nroom in which it committed suicide.\nOther halls have had exploding\nmicrowaves and incendiary grills. These\nfires highlight the inadequacies of the\nequipment and alarm systems in hall,\nthough as usual, nothing has been altered\nsince nobody was seriously hurt.\nCollege did not escape injury this year,\nwith the water in a tank on the eighth\nfloor of Me chEng making a dramatic\nescape. Not content with it's high position\nin the College hierarchy it decided that\nworking in the basement was it's aim. To\nreach this envious position it took a short\ncut down the main power ducts, shorting\nout the department in the process. A lesson in staff management there.\n\n"

    "content": "ENV1R0\nAlaska, the Exx\nThen and now\nAlaska is a treasure trove of natural\nresources. The ancient Inuit, the Indians\nof the North, lived for thousands of years\noff Alaska's renewable resources; the\nseals, fish and whales of Alaskan waters.\nIn modern times attention has focussed\non the region's rich reserves of nonrenewable resources; oil, gas, and mineral\nreserves. The extraction of these\nresources has proved controversial.\nAlaska is breathtakingly beautiful and is\nhome to rich flora and fauna. The\nenvironment of Alaska has neither been\ncomprehensively studied nor has any\nsuch area undergone similar\ndevelopment. Alaska is something of an\nenvironmental enigma. The effects of this\nlack of knowledge are twofold: a poor\nunderstanding of polar development has\nled to both insensitive development and\nun exploited opportunities.\nThe confusion and ignorance that lies\nbeneath the surface of polar development\nwas clearly seen when the 'Exxon Valdez'\nspilled her 11 million gallon oil cargo into\nPrince William Sound.\nThe Exxon Valdez\nOn March 24th1989, the Exxon oil\ntanker, the Exxon Valdez, broke open on\nBligh Reef and spilled 11.2 million gallons\nof crude oil into Prince William Sound.\nThirty thousand fish from nine different\nspecies died in the initial stages of the\nspill as did over a thousand otters. There\nagreement ends.\nenvironment is a lot tougher and more\nresilient than most people give them\ncredit for. All the evidence suggests\nPrince William Sound is a robust ,\nresilient environment well on the way to\nrecovery.' These environmental reports\nhad no mention of Exxon and instead\nbore the emblem 'Printed on recycled\npaper'.\nWhat is the truth\nEven apparently quantitative analysis can\nbe misleading. The histogram shows the\npink salmon harvest from 1978 to 1990.\nThe 1990 harvest is double that of the\nprevious year. Salmon have a two yearly\nlifecycle therefore the first figures of any\nsignificance would be those for 1991, two\nyears after the original spill. A recent\n^^^^^ I'^^ gj:mm mt mW mm mW mm^ mW MW m Block Island, April 1989\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment\nExxon was heavily criticised in the media\nduring early March 1991 for an alleged\nwhitewash surrounding the environmental\nimpact of the oil spill on Prince William\nSound. In July 1989 Exxon organised press\nconferences to show the world's media\nthe apparently pristine beaches of the\nSound. The before and after pictures of\nBlock Island are taken from a press pack\nhanded out at that time. There is strong\nevidence that those same beaches were\nre-oiled long after the media circus had\nmoved on.\nIndependent empirical evidence is hard\nto come by. The initial impact reports\nwere all written either by direct\nemployees of Exxon, or people paid by\nthem. These reports are subjective and\nnon-empirical. The following conflicting\nstatements appear in the publication\n'Environmental recovery of Prince\nWilliam Sound and the Gulf of Alaska',\n'Longterm studies of the recovery process\nare incomplete and recovery timescales\nsuggest some extrapolation', and in the\nsame publication, ' we saw nothing to\nindicate Prince Willaim Sound is\nparticularly fragile. The marine\nBlock Island, June 1990\n38\non Valdez Spill\nChannel 4 documentary revealed that\neven fish that did survive the original\nspill were polluted with oil. Valdez's canning factory was closed down by the\nlocal health inspectorate in July 1990 due\nto high levels of oil in fish.\nIndependent Reports\nThe only independent reports published\nto date examine the actual response to\nthe oil spill. In Kelso's 'Alaskan response\nto the environment', published in the\nFebruary 1991 edition of EST magazine,\nthe response to the oil spill is criticised in\nthree ways. The technical response to the\noil spill , the beach washing technique, is\nheavily criticised, the report also\nconcluded that there were insufficient\nresources and that the management of\nthese resources was ineffective. Despite\nthis criticism the United States\ngovernment, according to New Scientist\nOctober 1989, has delayed ratification of\nan international treaty aimed at\nformal ising who should be responsible for\noil spills, both their clean up and cost.\nLong Term\nSignificant amounts of oil are still being\nwashed ashore in Prince William Sound.\nFishermen describe the waters as 'dead'.\nThere has never been an oil spill of these\nproportions in this type of environment\nbefore. Scientists both Exxon funded and\nindependent must sit and wait before the\nlong term effects of the spill can be fully\nassessed.\nThe Inuit and Alaska\nAccording to the anthropologist James\nWatson the Inuit are 'one of the most\nsophisticated adaptations to the\nenvironment known to anthropology'.\nThe Inuit of Alaska are descendants of\nthe first human migrations, ten thousand\nyears ago, across the prehistoric\nland bridge now washed by the Bering\nSea. The Inuit are completely dependent\non the renewable resources, especially\nmarine mammals and fish. Until the late\nnineteenth century the Inuit lived in small\nsemi-nomadic groups with strong social\ncohesion.\nWhat Went Wrong?\nDuring the early twentieth century the\nInuit came into contact with 'the white\nman'. They became increasingly\ndependent on the commer ical fur trade\nand abandoned their subsistence way of\nlife. The fur trade collapsed in 1940 and\nthe Inuit were starving. In the latter half\nof the twentieth century over- fishing and\nculling of marine animals has decimated\nthe fauna of Alaskan waters. Even if the\nInuit had still had the skills to return to\ntheir old way of life the resources were\nno longer there.\nThe Balance is Redressed\nThe advent of oil and gas exploration had\nfocussed Inuit demands for self-determination. Their fight against the\nproposed MacKenzie pipeline was\nsuccessful and acted as a cohesive force\nwithin the Inuit people. The two groups\no orne out of that fight COPE, Committee\nof Original Peoples Entitlement and the\nITC, the Inuit Taprisat of Canada\ncontinued the fight for Inuit\nindependence. During their early years\nthe groups concentrated on the\nsettlement of land claims but growing\nLWIRO\npolitical awareness made Inuit\norganisations ever more determined to\ngain political independence for their\npeople.\nThe Future\nInuit and Oil and Gas companies have\nlearned to co-exist. In the same way the\nextraction of non-renewable resources\nmust co-exist with the renewable\nresources of the Arctic. Although our\nknowledge of the Arctic is limited the\nway ahead is clear. A balance: neither\nblind exploitation of non-renewable\nresources nor preservation of Alaska's renewable resources to the exclusion of\nall else. Through compromise Alaska's future can be made secure and its\nmagni fi en ce, encapsulated in the ancient\nInuit poem below, remain for generations\nwell after our own.\n/ arise from rest\nWith the beat of the raven's wings.\nI arise\nTo meet the day.\nMy eyes turn from the night\nTo gaze at the dawn\nNow whitening.\nNative Inuits\n39\n\n"

    "content": "IvIlA **\nThe Felix office has a reputation for\nbeing the sanctuary of dispossessed,\ndisgruntled and disillusioned science\nstudents seeking refuge from the\npeculiarities of the college and the people\nin it, and from the excessive tedium and\npain that many of the courses inflict. This\nhas generated a certain atmosphere\nwithin the office which though I often\nfeel is not altogether healthy, does give\nthe weekly output a certain objectivity. It\nalso seriously gets up the nose of people\nlike the Rector and associates whose job\nit is to sell the college to sixth former s, foreign governments and businesses by\ntelling them what a orgasmic ally superb\nplace it is, where the happy, oh so\nrapturous ly happy students only stop\nenjoying themselves when they fall asleep\nafter a long (but happy) day spent\nstudying their future vocation. I thoroughly enjoy irritating the powers of\nauthority, I'm sure I 'll have plenty of\nopportunity next year.\nFelix is now the proud owner of a collating machine. This will speed up the\ngrinding ly painful late night process of\nmanual collating - that is assembling each\ncopy of Felix by hand, with the aid of a great deal of alcohol. This technological\nleap has its obvious benefits, but its\ndownside is that the opportunity for\npeople from outside Felix to make\ncontact with the office is diminished.\nIn my second year at this place I was\nFelix's news editor, well, to be exact I was the entire news team - Felix has a perennial problem of too many chiefs and\nnot enough Indians. As well as stoking\nmy paranoia this has made me a 'news\nperson', meaning that I see Felix\nprimarily as a newspaper. This has a number of intrinsic problems, the main\none being that we need far more news\nreporters than we have at present. A secondary problem is that the front page\nis going to be news, not a photograph\nlike this year. I have heard a number of\npoints of view on this matter, generally\nopposed to mine, and I have decided to\nexert my authority and completely ignore\nthem. A tertiary problem is what to do\nwith our photographers now that they\ndon't have a front page to fill.\nBy far the biggest problem facing next\nyear's Felix is the same as has faced this\nyear's, namely the lack of volunteers\nrunning it. Those who have worked on it\nthis year have done an excellent job, but\nthey all have degrees to get so it is\nhighly unethical to push them to do more\nthan they are doing already. The upshot\nof this is that complaints about the\nquality, contents or quantity of Felix are\nsingularly pointless. This is not wilful\ndismissal of those complaints, but merely\nsaying that the solution to the problem\nlies within the hands of the plaintiff. If\nyou feel that the quality of English is\npoor, spelling is abysmal or that there is\nnot enough news, don't stop complaining,\nbut do come and do something\nconstructive about it.\nIf Felix cannot depend on people to\ncome into the office by their own\ninitiative, a campaign of leafleting and\nposte ring may be instigated. If this fails I may be compelled to resuscitate the\ncustom of press ganging. So please, help!\nWe desperately need more volunteers.\nAlthough I hope that I will be able to\nwork with Zoe, Jonathan and Steve of the\nUnion executive elect next year I believe\nit is important that the Felix editor should\nfeel no guilt at slamming a member of\nthe executive if that editor thinks they\ndeserve it. I have no evidence to suppose\nthat any of these three disagree with me\non this point, but just to emphasise it,\nFelix must never be allowed to become\nthe lap dog of the Union executive. It\nwould lose all credibility and what's more, it would become terribly, terribly\ndull. Speaking of lap dogs, it looks like\nthere might be a general election during\nmy year of office. I'm sure I get as\nirritated as any sane person with the\nbackstabbing and shit throwing that\naccompanies this triennial orgy of\nsenselessness, so I promise from the\nuttermost depths of my limb ic system that\nFelix will not become the exclusive\nbattleground of the college's representatives of bol she vis m or\nbourgeoisie.\nFinally I wish to extend my gratitude to\nChris and Andy for keeping the flame\nalive for the past year - I hope to see\nthem both again after the summer\nholiday. Undying thanks goes towards the\ntrusty band of Felixites and Felixettes\nwho are, in the main, the people\nresponsible for each week's baby. Not\nforgetting, of course, the people whose\nword is law within the office, and who\ncan cause the building to tremble and the\nmountains to shake, Andy the printer and\nRose the typesetter operator.\nI am looking forward to being editor\nnext year.\nFreshers issue next year comes out on 30th September. Anybody wanting an\nentry should see me before the 31st August. If you would like work printed\nover the summer, see me as soon as possible.\n13\n\n"

But, keeping eyes\npeeled both left and right,\nmany a beer can be taken\nin many a distinctive pub.\nFollow Phil's advice and\ndon't lose your wallet...\nGiven the task of conjuring up an article\nfor Felix at this slack time of year I have\nbegun desperately to search through my\nlimited rep e to ire of student experiences\nand anecdotes to find a subject to interest\nthe discerning IC punter. 1 have decided\nto forego any macho posturing on my\npseudo-athletic achievements or\npolemic is m about the Gulf War in order\nto present a short users guide to the pubs\non the Portobello Road.\nAt this point anybody who does admit\nto knowing me will have their toes curled\nup in the cringe position and be hurriedly\nskipping through the rest of the issue to\nfind that map of the hairdressers in South\nKen where we IC fashion creatures can\nget a \u00a320 haircut for only \u00a319. I shall\nleave them to it and begin the tour. A quick note however to any of you\nbearded real ale 'enthusiasts' out there, I suggest you join the queue at the salon.\nA ho lost ic approach is what is called for,\nso, I won't be harping on about the\nrelative merits of different pints of warm\ndonkey's piss. Anyway when was the last\ntime you were propositioned in a bar\nwith the line. 'I couldn't help noticing you\nwere supping a full bodied, yet still\nyeasty pint of Old Cats Flaps xxxx x'( insert Big Boy or Darling as required).\nThe first venue, 'The Sun in Splendour'\nis located at the southern tip of the road.\nThis pub is an aberration, has nothing\nworth noting and if you closed your eyes\nyou could be in any one of a hundred\nsimilar establishments across London. The\nsame cannot be said of the other pubs on\nthe road and you could be walking home\nwithout your wallet.\nA300 metre walk down the road brings\nus to the 'Portobello Gold'. As advertised\nby the bright pink pimp mobile with\nattendant Harley Davidsons squatting\noutside. The interior design was by\nsomebody who really thought that if he\ndrank enough Bacardi, whilst waiting for\na number 52 bus in Cricklewood, then he\nwould be in the Bahamas. Punters are\noffered a panoramic (yet beer stained)\nview of Montego Bay, complete with fake\npalm trees to accompany the equally\nsynthetic culinary offerings of what is\nessentially a wine bar masquerading as a restaurant. Salvation is at hand however\nas we now head for the 'Earl of\nLonsdale'. This Sam Smith pub has\nsuffered yuppy and Australian\ninterdiction s in the last year. A meat-market atmosphere still prevails however,\nwith the well-heeled offspring of sixties\nrebels, turned chartered accountants,\nthronging around the expansive bar.\nThey are what Mark Knopfler refers to as\n'Portobello Belles' vying with each other\nto poses s the fattiest cardigan and\nhollowest cheeks, whilst at the same time\nholding unconditional offers to 'good'\nOxbridge colleges. A few stalwarts of the\nlegions of the disposes sed begin to make\nan appearance in this pub. Their numbers\nrapidly diminished when the table football\nwas taken away last year, and they now\nonly really attend to watch England\nmatches in the conservatory, the groans\nof their collective failure to achieve\norgasm, at each missed shot, shuddering\nthrough to the rest of the pub at 10\nminute intervals. \u2022\nThe door of the next destination, 'The\nPortobello Star', a minute's walk away\nproclaims 'No food, No children, No dogs,\nNo portable phones', they should also\nhave mentioned no service, no room and\nnowhere to sit. The medieval door policy\nof this tiny bar serves to exclude snoopy\ntourists and suit wearers, distilling out a client el which, judging by their sick\nexpressions, have average life\nexpectations of maybe two years. The\nbarman seems to be mumbling something\nabout keeping off the moors, or is it, 'we\ndon't get your sort round 'ere' but we IC\nstudents can rest assured as we know you\ncan't catch rickets from sitting on a bar\nstool.\nWe have reached the bottom of the hill\nand from now on I have decided to\nA User's Guide\nchange the names of the remaining pubs.\nI make no apologies, since the newly\nchristened pubs have titles more suited to\ntheir characters and some Martin Amis\nreaders may be enlightened in the\nprocess.\nThe first, a hundred metres down from\nthe Star is 'Pickwicks' a new-Watneys pub\nwith a drifting, listless complement of\nrefugees from the other, more lively,\nvenues on the road. If there has been one\ntoo many drug busts this week at The\nBlack Cross the place fills out. Overall it\nis unremarkable except for the park\nbenches outside which encourage\nincontinent canines and tourists to sit\ndown and shed their loads. Looking at\nthe crap the overburdened tourists have\njust been sold on the market, one\nmarvels at the mimicry the dogs are\ncapable of. Past the Electric Cinema and\nover the road is 'The Pub That's A Caff.\nThis sch itz op he nic place has improved\nremarkably in the last few months and\nnow, happily for the owners, is in the\nposition of being the trendiest and\nnaturally the priciest pub on the road.\nFashions will change. Last year, to be\nseen in The Pub That's A Caff was a more obvious admission to a lack of style\nthan being caught stark bol lock naked,\nrunning down Gloucester Road humming\na Van Morrison song. During the\nunpopular period a twice weekly serving\nof 'World Music' was laid on by the then\nowner, a huge fat bastard who would sit\nin the corner sipping a diet coke. What\nhe didn't realise is that people going out\nfor a drink don't want to be confronted\nby the inevitable consequences of 25\nyears of bodily abuse and the residents of\nan area where white, middle class,\nliberals are in the minority don't give a tinkers toss about 'World Music'. The\nsolution was simple, turn the volume,\nsteal the 'cool as fuck' barman from the\nFEATURES\nplace down the road and drastically\nincrease the prices. That is capitalism.\nOne hundred metres northwards one\nmeets a pub which is as rough as a badger's arse. The 'Black Cross' can only\nbe reached by negotiating a crowd of\nleather clad youths who seem to be\nsneezing in a most pe cula r way. They\nwalk up to you and exclaim, 'Hashoo!'\nwithout even blinking their eyes, pat their\nsoon to be exterminated pit ball terriers\non the head and then start mumbling\nabout coke and other soft drinks. The\nefforts of these agents of the tempor ance society's should be ignored by we hard-living IC students and I advise immediate\nentry into the bar and the ordering of a pint of strong beer.\nThis pub is the centre of the West\nLondon trade in banned substances. The\ntwo beautiful blue pool tables at the back\nare the scene of more money changing\nhands than the Stock Exchange and the\npolice know about it. They raid the place\nregularly. If you are six foot tall, have\nshort hair and like to wear big, black\nboots don't walk into the Black Cross and\nexpect to be greeted like the prodigal\nson. I always feel genuinely uneasy about\ngoing to the toilet as it involves passing\nthrough the 'dealing' area. A flashing\nglance could easily be followed up by a flashing knife. This is the only pub where\nI have seen somebody glassed. It is also\nthe most interesting, dangerous, exciting\npub on the road and has an atmosphere\nthat has attracted filmmakers ('I hired a contract killer') and novelists, it being the\ncentral location in 'London Fields' by\nMartin Amis. On a Saturday the Black\nCross is an apex of a miniature Bermuda\nTriangle for the locals that includes their\nmarket stalls and William Hill the\nbookies.

    "content": "9\nFELIX\nOf Firecrackers,<\nWell, one day it happens that I am sitting\nin Ian Richard's chow joint, the\nCaterpillar Cafe, partaking of a little chilli\nand rice, which is a very refreshing dish\nat this time of year, when I am suddenly\naware of a loud thud beside me.\nNaturally, I am very much perturbed, as I am not accustomed to hearing loud thuds\nin Ian Richard's joint, and I am thinking\nthat Ian Richard's blood pressure may be\nshooting up some, because the last time\nhe hears a loud thud in his joint it is the\ninhabitants of the Iraqi Embassy trying\nout a small shipment of firecrackers from\noverseas, which is an event apt to cause\nloud thuds around and about in general.\nHowever, on looking round I discover\nthat the loud thud is on account of Shifty\nShan dropping into the chair next to me\nas heavy as a South Kensington copper\nbusting up lock-in, which is very heavy,\nindeed.\nNow 1 am'extremely cautious, since it is\nwell known to one and all that Shifty\nShan is having some considerable dispute\nwith the authorities which seem to think\nthat he is owing them dough, and I do\nnot wish to associate with such a character, especially as a guy may get\njudged by the company he keeps.\nNaturally though, I give him a big hello,\nas he may think I am being inhospitable\nif I suddenly take it on the lam out of\nthere, and may get so red up at me, and\nthere is no percentage in having such a guy as Shifty Shan so red up at you, on\naccount of his being a greatly respected\ncitizen in the underworld. Shifty Shan\nleans forward very close, and if Bookie\nButcher is per sent at this moment, he will\ngive three-to-one to anybody who cares\nto take it that that Shifty Shan very soon\nsoils up his nice shirt front with my chilli,\nbut then Shifty Shan stops and speaks to\nme as follows:\n'You remember,' he says, 'that some\ntime ago Happy Steve has a most\nintriguing notion for a Rag stunt?'\nNow this guy which Shan mentions is\nknown to folks who are in on these\nthings, as Happy Steve because he is\nalways going about with such a dolorous\nexpression on his kisser that anyone\nwould think he just loses all his dough, or\nhis doll, though it is well understood that\nhe is pretty well up to the noggin with\npotatoes, and no doll ever leaves him\nthat would sadden him so severely, what\nwith his being homely as a mud fence, or\nmaybe more so. I wish to state, though,\nthat I know of no party more honest than\nHappy Steve, which is a fortunate thing\nbecause he is also the head guy in the\nRag business, which is a dodge for\ncausing decent citizens to part with their\nscratch by telling them that it is to be\ngiven to sick children, and elephants, and\nsuch; and any party who is willing to be\nso free with the potatoes he collects in\nthis manner is a sure thing to have plenty\nof integrity about him.\nAnyway, I remember very clearly that\nHappy Steve once comes up with a notion which I will indeed say is\nintriguing, although I will use a much\nstronger word, which anybody who\nknows me will be very much surprised to\nhear me say, since I am generally\nregarded as something of a soft pooch, at\nthat. I recall that he is good and scotched\nup at the time, which is by no means an\nunusual situation for him, and that all\nother citizens within hearing are equally\nwell dosed with assorted beverages, if not\nmore so, and so I am willing to lay plenty\nof six to five that no-one, not even Happy\nSteve, remembers this notion the next\nday.\nNow Happy Steve's idea is to nip into\nthe Iraqi Embassy very quietly, like cats\non tiptoe, though anyone who sees\nHappy Steve will protest very loudly that\nhe is about as much like a cat on tiptoe\nas King Kong, and borrow the name plate from the door of His Excellency the\nAmbassador without asking his\npermission first. It seems that many guys\nwho associate with Happy Steve are in\nthe habit of borrowing signs and\nnameplates and such things without\npermission, and the gendarmes never get\nthe old wind of them.\nOf course, I say to Shifty Shan that I wish to have no truck with this scheme,\nand in fact I want no part of it, because\nmaybe the gendarmes are getting wise d But now it appears that Shifty Shan\nnonetheless has some of his faculties\nabout him on that occasion, and this\nworries me no little. In fact, I am\nbeginning to wish most heartily that the\nloud thud I hear is indeed a firecracker\nfrom overseas, even if it makes Ian\nRichard's blood pressure shoot up so high\nit spouts out the top of his noggin,\nbecause it will mean that the Iraqi\nEmbassy becomes nothing but a burnt-out\nshell, and furthermore contains nothing of\nany interest wha so ever to parties with\nsuch ideas as Happy Steve has at this\ntime.\nup by this time, unless they have less\nbrains than a bullfrog. Furthermore, I say,\nit may be that His Excellency the\nAmbassador is sitting in his office when\nwe borrow his name plate, and feels that\nhe wishes to keep it, and perhaps it\nenters his mind to try out some more\nfirecrackers. But by this time Shifty Shan\nis getting impatient, because it appears he\nagrees to meet Happy Steve with enough\nguys to carry out the heist, and Happy\nSteve will be greatly distressed if there\nare not enough guys, and when Happy\nSteve is distressed you can bet aC note\nany day of the week that other parties\n16\nMadmen,\naround him will feel his distress very\nacutely. So before you can say Jack\nRobinson, I find myself walking to the\nIraqi Embassy with Shifty Shan, and\nHappy Steve, and a party by the name of\nPenguin, whose square monicker is Marc\nEllis, and who is looking to get a slice of\nHappy Steve's action if Happy Steve\nshould ever pop off unexpectedly, and\nanother party called Paul Reynish, who\nhas such a sweet and innocent puss that\nyou will not think he is in the habit of\nflaunting the rules of polite society,\nalthough when it comes to borrowing\nproperty without the owner's permission,\nhe is just naturally a curly wolf. Also\nalong with us is Little Chas, who is\nalways seen in the same clothes except\nwhen he is dressed up to go to some\nknowledge of politics, but I notice that\none or two parties in the crowd are\nrod ded up under their suits, and I see\nthat one guy has a pineapple, which\nsome folks call a grenade, in his back\npocket, so I judge that they feel rather\nstrongly about things in general. I cannot\nsee that there is any percentage in trying\nto enter the Iraqi Embassy at this time,\nsince the coppers guarding the joint are\nall rod ded up too, and there are a great\nmany of them, but Paul Reynish tells\nthem that we are flogging insurance, and\nwe are allowed inside, because it seems\nthat no-one desires to insure the Iraqi\nEmbassy, it being a proposition somewhat\nhotter than a ton of coals, and they are\ndesperate for insurance in case the mob\nwishes to break their windows, or\nswank occasion, and who offends the\nnoses of many decent citizens in his time,\nparticularly since he is so little that he\nnever reaches higher than their noses, if\nthat.\nWhen we reach the Iraqi Embassy, we\nfind a middling large mob outside with\nvery large banners, and these people are\nyelling very loud, in language that is-'\nmost impolite, and it seems that what\nthey want is for the inhabitants of the\nIraqi Embassy to leave, because their\npolitics and their beliefs and suchlike are\ndisquieting the local population more than\nsomewhat. Personally, I have very little\nsomething.\nShifty Shan remains outside, because,\nhe says, his position does not allow him\nto engage in anything that is unlawful or\nnot allowed, although he wishes us every\nsuccess and furthermore, he says he sees\na friend in the mob, and wishes to chew\nthe fat with him. So we enter the joint\nand make our way up the stairs towards\nHis Excellency the Ambassador's office,\nexplaining to one and all that we are\nflogging insurance, though many parties\nappear very surprised indeed to be told\nthat such a looking guy as Little Chas is\nin this profession; on the other hand, it is\n9\nFELIX\nloudly agreed that Happy Steve has such\na kisser as you will never find on anyone\nbut an insurance dealer.\nWe find His Excellency the\nAmbassador's office, and his name plate is\nno small slab such as is on the door of\nShifty Shan's room, because it has to\nhave His Excellency's full title on it,\nwhich is His Excellency the Minister\nExtraordinary and Ambassador\nPlenipotentiary of such-and-such, and\nmoreover his full name, which is OmarAl-Khareem El Wahlid Hussein Bin\nSalmani and some more too, and Happy\nSteve does not see how we can stroll out\nof the Iraqi Embassy with this object\nabout our persons. In fact, it seems\nHappy Steve is rather displeasure d altogether, but with Shifty Shan in\nparticular, and he says:\n'I regard Shifty Shan's conduct in\nleaving us to carry out matters by\nourselves as ungentlemanly in the\nextreme, and furthermore, I think he is\nnothing but a low-down sab bo, at that.'\nNow sab bo is a most degrading term\nused to describe citizens who selflessly\ndevote themselves to the common good\nof the population for a very unsatisfactory\nsalary, like Shifty Shan, when they are\nnot doing their sacred and bounden duty,\nlike Shifty Shan. However, I think it is\nvery improper of Happy Steve to refer to\nShifty Shan in this manner, so I say to\nhim, 'Steve, sab bo is not such a word as I like to hear being used about any citizen,\nbecause it is most undignified, and what\nis more,' I say, 'it is illiterate.' However,\nthis only riles him up more, and he looks\nas if he is about to haul off and punch\nme in the snoot, so I step back, and\nnearly step on Little Chas. But by this\ntime, Paul Reynish has the old tools out,\nand he is removing the sign as smoothly\nas I ever see a sign removed, and I wish\nto say that I see a great many signs\nremoved in my time.\nWell, at this point, everything is looking\nvery hot sy tots y, and the only remaining\nsnag which may upset things is that if the\ncoppers give us the eye very closely\nwhen we come out, they may notice that\nwe are carrying some property with us,\nand naturally they will wish to know if\nwe have permission to borrow it.\nHowever, Penguin, whose mind is well\nknown to be no Limburger when it\ncomes to tricky problems, suggests that\nwe bundle up Little Chas like he is\ninjured and carry him out on the sign, as\nthough it is a stretcher such as the\nquacks use to carry injured persons. Little\nChas expresses no little indignation at\nthis, and states that he does not wish to\nbe bundled up in any manner, shape or\nform, but Penguin b offs him on the\nnoggin with a Rag can that Penguin has\nbrought along in case anybody wishes to\ngive us any money for the sick elephants\nor whatever, so that Little Chas does not\n17\n\n"

    "content": "When nuclear power was first\nintroduced people said that electricity\nwould be produced so cheaply that it\nwouldn't even be worth metering. Forty\nyears on we are still paying the bills. If\nnuclear funding had been ploughed into\nrenewable energy research from the\nbeginning we might have achieved that\nenviable goal. Sadly though the weapons\nmotives dictated a different path which,\ntoday, is still fraught with the debate\nwhich plagued it from Day 1.\nWith the inevitable connections\nbetween nuclear power and nuclear\nweapons \"Joe public\" believe that in\norder to be pro-nuclear power you have\nto be pro-nuclear weapons. However,\nsupport of the former does not dictate\napproval of the later. In Sweden 50% of\nthe national electricity is produced by\nnuclear reactors, while they have no\nnuclear weapons. In Britain many people\nwho work in the nuclear power are also\nin CND!\nThe basic principal of producing\nelectricity is the same using any fuel, but\nwith nuclear power the amount of fuel\nused to produce the energy through\nfission is much smaller. To produce the\nenergy consumed by one person during\ntheir lifetime, would require 54 tonnes of\ncoal, or 33 tonnes of oil, or 3kg of\nUranium. The benefits are obvious. The\ndifference of three orders of magnitude of\nmass is large enough to out way many of\nthe disadvantages. Indeed standing\ndownwind from a coal fired power station\none is exposed to more radiation than\nliving in the proximity of any nuclear\npower plant.\nThe allegations that incidences of\nleukaemia coincide with populations\naround nuclear power stations remain\nstatistically unproved. The likelihood of a completely uniform distribution of\nanything is very low. Even \"random\"\nnumbers are observed to \"cluster.\" Of the\nthirty leukaemia clusters that have been\nidentified in the UK, only 2-3 are next to\npower stations. According to Morgan Rue\nof BNF Ltd. there is apparently a higher\ncorrelation of leukaemia cases to ancient\nmonuments. Living in Britain the\nradiation you are exposed to can be\nbroken down as follows:\n47 % Terrestrial Radon\n14 % Terrestrial gamma from granites\n12 % Eating (K40 in Hamburgers)\n12 % Medical X rays\n10 % Cosmic radiation\n4 % Thoron inside homes\n0.4 % Fallout from weapons tests\n0.4 % Miscellaneous...travel, luminous\nwatches...\n0.2 % Occupational (eg dental nurse)\n0.1 % Nuclear discharge from power\ngeneration\nUranium is abundant and does not have\nmany other uses as it is very brittle and\ndense. Despite the obvious attractions,\npolitical decisions in some countries have\nfrozen the nuclear programme. In the\nUnited States, reactor construction has\ncome to a halt, no new orders have been\nplaced since 1978. In Sweden the\ntermination of nuclear power generation\nby 2010 has been called for and in\nSwitzerland and Germany there is a de\nfacto moratorium.\nHowever, on a global scale, nuclear\npower is a growing industry. In 1989,\n16% of the world's electricity was\nproduced by 426 nuclear reactors. There\nare currently 96 more reactors under\nconstruction which when completed\nwould bring the total nuclear generating\ncapacity to 397,178 MW. In 1989 12\nreactors were added to the global grid\nand construction began on five reactors:\ntwo in Japan, two in South Korea and\none in the USSR. Does this mean that\nnuclear power is becoming safer?\nWhether incidents or accidents is a matter of definition. Whatever you want\nto call them, they are always serious and\npotentially deadly: Germany has one of\nthe most exhaustive records of nuclear\nincidents. This is perhaps a function of\ntheir stringent laws which require details\nof every episode that effects safety. In\n1988, 296 such incidents were\ndocumented. Causes were recorded as\nincorrect planning and construction,\nincorrect use of equipment, incorrect\nmanufacture of equipment. Even if the\nreaction process could be made 100%\nsafe there is still all the waste to be dealt\nwith.\nLike any other process, nuclear fission\ngenerates waste products. Although less\nvolume than other methods, the\nplutonium by-product is toxic ally far more\nof a problem. The liquid waste is stored\nin stainless steel containers which, after\nthe liquid has cooled, are put into\nlandfills. The volumes of waste can be\nreduced substantially when the liquid is\nconverted to a super cool liquid (glass\nform), and it can then be stored under\nInternational Safety Guide-lines. These\nstipulate that the plutonium waste cannot\nbe diverted to weapons production\nwithout the rest of NATO knowing.\nThe alternative to landfill, is\nreprocessing. This involves extracting the\nPlutonium and the unused Uranium from\nspent fuel. Currently there are four\nreprocessing plants in the world; Sellafield\nin the UK, La Hague in France, Tarapur\nin India and Tokai in Japan. Four more\nare under construction. Allegations of\nradioactive discharge from the Sellafield\nplant are dismissed by BNFL Ltd. Rue\nstates that there is \"less radioactive\ndischarge than from coffee beans. In\nthirty years it has put half a tonne of\nplutonium into the Irish sea. This\ncompares with the two million tonnes of\nnaturally occurring alpha o mitter s already\nthere. The mutant fish trawled in by\nfisherman are put down to sampling\nerror. \"Mutants are naturally occurring\nanyway\", says Rue. \"Around the\ndischarge pipes fisherman bring back all\nthe mutants they catch. Further away,\nthey are thrown back to preserve the\nclean image of the industry.\"\nReprocessing still results in some waste\nwhich still needs storing; typically for 500\nyears. After this period it can be\nreclassified from high level to\nintermediate level; which is low enough\nto be manageable. Stored waste is\nalready producing problems. The United\nStates' Washington State Hansford\nNuclear Reservation is the oldest site,\nwith 177 steel concrete tanks containing\n40\nks?\nE. WIRO\nradioactive waste. Sixty-six of these are\nleaking, twenty-two are accumulating\ndangerous amounts of hydrogen and\nanother 22 are potentially explosive. The\nstar of the reservation is tank 101-SY\nwhich is sending up hydrogen bubbles\nthrough the hard crust. The dilemma is\nhow to gain access to the tanks without\ncreating an explosion and scattering\nradioactive material over a large area.\nSo can nuclear power with all its pitfalls\nand problems ever by made safe? In 1946\nthe then US Secretary of State Dean\nAcheson along with David Lithienthal and\nBernard Baruch of the United Nations\nAtomic Energy Commission called for the\ncreation of a global agency to govern\natomic power. The agency could ensure\nreactor safety, to implement and monitor\nwaste storage facilities, while taking into\naccount the concern of the year 2000 and\nbeyond. The idea of International Waste\nstorage facilities was developed further by\nWolf Hafele in 1976. He believed that\nsuch facilities would be immune to\nnational politics and so would not hold\nback development in science and\ntechnology of waste disposal methods.\nBut even with improvements in design,\nefficient fuel cycles, and other\ntechnologies, would more countries\nconsider nuclear power unless it is\neconomically feasible?\nIn the UK where nuclear power has\ncontributed to the national grid for over\nforty years, John Wakeham, (Energy\nSecretary) last year gave formal approval\nto the building of Britain's second\npress uri sed water reactor at Hinkley point\non the Somerset coast. The project at\nHinkley point will cost \u00a3l,700m and will\ndepend on the Government's review of\nits' nuclear programme, scheduled for\n1994. The inquiry into Hinkley-C included\nan investigation of economic benefits of\nnuclear power alongside fossil fuels, but\nwith the rates of return needed by\nprivate investigators, nuclear power\nlooked unfavourable. This resulted in the\nremoval of the ageing Magnox reactors,\nand the removal of the nuclear power\nstations from the privatisation of the\nelectricity supply industry and scrapped\nthe plans for Sizewell-C and Wylfa-B. For the moment nuclear power is losing\npopularity in some countries, but since its\norigin in the 1950's the propaganda from\nboth camps continues and the debate\ngoes on.\nSTOIC PRESENT GOING FOR\nCOPPERS\nA fun new quiz show after\nthe news at l pm on\nThursday\nBritish Coal\nChallenge Ban\nBritish Coal is renewing its efforts to develop a new open cast pit in NW Leicestershire. The\nproposals have been met by fierce opposition,\nAnna Teeman reports.\nIn August British Coal will open its appeal\nagainst Leicestershire County Council's decision to reject a planning application\nfor a new open cast mine in North West\nLeicestershire.\nThe area concerned lies to the south of\nCoalville which has its own open cast pit,\nCoalfield North. The proposed site lies\nbetween the picturesque villages of\nHeather, Ravenstone, Packstone and\nNormanton-le-Heath. The villages'\nresidents, many of whom are vehemently\nopposed to the proposal, are fighting\nBritish Coal through the organisation\nFOIL (Fight Opencast Mining in\nLeicestershire).\nFOIL'S opposition to open cast mining is\nbased on both economic and\nenvironmental grounds. The\nenvironmental arguments aside, FOIL is\nincensed by the apparent economic\nstupidity of open cast mining. The\nproposed site, known by the Coal Board\nand coalfield west, would, in common\nwith other open cast pits in Great Britain,\nproduce high sulphur coal. The power\ngenerating companies, open cast mining's all powerful customer, foist penalties on\nsuch coal. In addition low sulphur coal\nmust be imported into the country, at\ncost, for proper mixing.\nFOIL see just the phrase 'open cast mining' as misleading. NW Leicestershire\nhas a tradition of deep-mine coal mining.\nUp to 4,500 miners have been made\nredundant due to pit closures in recent\nyears. Using the phrase 'open cast mining',\nargue FOIL 'sways people into\nacceptance'. They see the open cast extraction process as more akin to civil\nengineering than to mining. The\nemployment benefits for the local\ncommunity are minimal, say FOIL,\ncompletely opposite to the days when a whole village would be employed by a deep-mine.\nFOIL are deeply concerned about the\nenvironmental impact of a large open cast pit on the local area. Residents are\nconcerned about dust, noise, traffic and\nthe aesthetic impact of an open cast pit.\nThe environmental section within the\noriginal British Coal planning application\nlists all possible environmental hazards\nbut contains only vague assurances that\nno detrimental environmental impact will\nresult. According to Mr A Crompton of\nBritish Coal Region Project Group, his\ncompany intend to present more\nquantitative information at the\nforthcoming appeal. Mr Crompton was\nextremely cagey about what such\ninformation might contain. British Coal\nare keen to keep their new\nenvironmental plans under wraps and\naway from the action groups until the\nappeal.\nEven if British Coal do pull a sparkling\nnew environmental plan out of the bag,\nlocal residents are unlikely to change\ntheir opinion of the Coal Board. British\nCoal has already simply chopped down\n'Green Lane', a bridle way documented as\ncontaining hedgerows of enormous\necological significance, on the boundaries\nof the proposed site. As to increased\nnoise British Coal's measurements of the\ncrucial background noise were taken as a jumbo jet flew over and an articulated\nlorry rumbled past, say local residents.\nBritish Standards 4142, by which the Coal\nBoard would have to abide if a new pit\nwere opened, state that noise would not\nexceed the present level by over lOd b. By not averaging out their readings,\nBritish Coal attempted to stay within that\nall important lOd b range, foul play say\nresidents. British Coal, in the original\nenvironmental statement say dust\nwouldn't be a problem, despite\nunequivocal proof that it pays a local\nnursery owner living near Coalfield North\n\u00a33,00 per year to clean dust from his\ngreenhouse windows.\nBritsh Coal are adamant that coal\nwould be transported by rail; residents\nquestion this. Two children were killed\nlast year by lorries from a nearby pit\nwhere all the coal went by rail.\nThe appeal is due to open in\nLeicestershire on August 6th1991 is\nexpected to last three weeks.\n\n"

Reports in the national\nmedia suggested that Mr Birch was\nfrustrated with the limitations on\ntreatment he could offer patients enforced\nby the administration policies at St\nMary's. Mr Birch is reported to have said that it\nwas 'no longer professionally possible' to\ncare for children to the levels he wanted\nto. He said that the implementation of\n'trust status', soon to be adopted by St\nMary's, would add to the bureaucracy\nthat already hindered him getting to see\npatients.\nAlthough Mr Birch was too busy to\ncomment yesterday, a spokesperson from\nthe Stanmore hospital said that 'we are\ndelighted he is moving .. and is going to\ncentre his activity here at Stanmore'.\nDelayed w| n eD ,\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, has stated that\nthe proposed changes to the college day\nwill not be implemented this October. He\nadded that it will probably not occur\neven in January 1992 as the timetable for\nmany of the departments was already set.\nMend-a Bihe\nPETE* THOMAS BICYCLE\nREPAIRS\nSALES\nAND ACCESSORIES\n4-6 Effle Road\nFulham, London SW6 IT D0713715867 There are plans afoot to convert the\nbasement of 170 Queensgate into a wine\nbar for academics and alumni. The\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, told Felix that the\nfeasibility of doing this - both technically\nand financially - had not been studied,\nand that if the plan was to go ahead it\nmight occur next summer.\nSir Eric said that academics and alumni\nneed more than the Holland Club; 'they\nneed faculty clubs such as many\nAmerican universities have'. He added\nthat 'if it can work financially it will have\na useful effect on the college'. In his view\nthe college needs somewhere where\nalumni can drop in when visiting the\ncollege and where college staff can meet\nafter work. He said that* his objective was\nto 'get alumni to make a bigger\ncontribution to the college as a whole'.\nLast year the whole of the ground floor\nof 170 Queensgate except the room\nfacing the garden was renovated. This\nsummer the remaining room is to be\nredecorated. 'I don't think this is\ndebatable', said the Rector, and added\nthat the building was often rented out\nand was where 'the great and the good',\nindustry and commerce were persuaded\nto support the college.\nDirty\nDealing\nDoctor\nA warden of a college hall has been\naccused of attempted fraud this week. Dr\nJoe Cartwright, the warden of Willis\nJackson house, is alleged to have fined a student in his hall \u00a350, stating that the\ncheque should be made payable to Dr\nCartwright himself. This is in direct\ncontravention to the rules laid down in\n'discipline in Imperial College' where it\nstates that 'all monies from fines shall be\ndonated to the Union charity of the year'.\nFollowing an appeal by the student\nconcerned, who had removed and\ndamaged a hall stereo player, the matter\nwas brought to light and the fine was\npaid to the charity. According to both Dr\nCartwright and Dr Brian Levitt, the\nchairman of the Student Residence\nTribunal and also a Westminster City\nConservative councillor, though it was\ntrue that this had happened, nothing\nunacceptable had been done. Dr Levitt\ntold Felix that whether the fine was made\npayable to the Rag charity or not\ndepended on whether it was considered a 'fine' or a 'charge' - the latter being\nmade payable to the hall concerned for\ndamage done to it. He said that in this\ncase it 'could have been either.'\nA secondary allegation concerns the\nappointment of a sub warden in the hall.\nSources from the Union categorically\ndeny that this sub warden took up office\nafter being approved by the Subwarden\nAppointment Panel, which is the only\nlegitimate way of doing so. Dr Cartwright\nin turn states that he did nothing wrong\nand that Ben Turner, Union deputy\npresident, was informed and agreed to\nthe placement. This Mr Turner refutes,\nsaying that all he did was to tell Dr\nCartwright exactly what channels he\nshould use.\nIn addition, a number of sources have\nsaid that a former sub warden, Mike\nPriestnall, stayed on in the hall after his\nterm of office paying a weekly rent of\n\u00a320 to Dr Cartwright. Dr Cartwright in\nturn said that he had offered Mr Priestnall\nthe hall guest room for a month while he\nwas searching for somewhere else to stay\nand that the rent was paid into the hall\namenities fund.\nDr Cartwright concluded by saying all\nthese allegations were 'definately not\ntrue.'\n\n"

    "content": "NHS Reforms\nparticularly true in the area of systems\nwhich provide management with\ninformation on resources, costs and the\nprogress of contracts. Why else are\nhospitals quoting such a wide range of\nprices for the same procedure? (Even a simple 'bed day' in a London hospital can\ncost anything between SI80 and \u00a3250.)\nThe NHS is waking up to the fact that it\nneeds accurate, timely information on all\nits activities, to be able to manage itself\nsuccessfully whether the reforms endure\nbeyond the life of this government or are\nabandoned as rapidly as they were\nintroduced. The NHS is finally waking up\nto the fact that it needs information\nsystems and information technology of\nthe kind that have been used in industry\nand the commercial sector for years.\nSadly, its plunge into IT is in many cases\ncausing as many problems in the new\nsystem as all the other factors.\nThe NHS is an immature market as far\nas IT is concerned. 'Mature' industries put\nup to 20% of their expenditure into IT.\nThe NHS spends less than half a percent\nof its expenditure (around \u00a3200 million\nper year, expected to grow to around\n\u00a3500 million per year over the next five\nyears). It lacks expertise in specifying,\npurchasing, installing, operating and\nmanaging information systems. It has\ninsufficient and inexperienced staff and\nhas been slow to recruit or train. One of\nthe most damning reports on the NHS\nproduced by the National Audit Office,\n\"Managing computer projects in the\nNational Health Service\", concluded that\n\"management of computer projects was\noften weak, with many failures to follow\ngood practice, resulting in poor value for\nmoney\".\nIn addition, some system suppliers have\nseen the chance to turn a quick buck and\nare fleecing the NHS with inflated prices\nand unsuitable systems. Where the NHS\ndevelops its own systems, these often\noverrun on cost and price, are poorly\ndesigned and still fail to meet the needs\nof the users. The systems already in place\nare fragmented and run on a bewildering\narray of hardware and software. Jo\nBayes, a department of health research\nstudent, put it succinctly when she said,\n\"you name it, we've got it. Not only that,\nwe have all the previous marks, models\nand versions, and those are just the ones\nwe know about!\"\nThe NHS also lacks any clear strategy\non information and information systems.\nIt is disturbing that, five years after the\nresource management initiative was\nlaunched, the deputy director of the NHS\nManagement Executive's information\nsystems directorate, Ray Rogers, could\ncall his workshop session at the annual\nHealthcare Computing conference \"FIRST\nthoughts on an information strategy for\nthe NHS\".\n\u2022 Nowhere is the folly of such haste and\ninexperience shown more clearly than in\nthe area of GP fund holding. GP practices\nwhich wished to become fund holders had\nto have more than 9000 patients on their\nlist and to already be sophisticated\ncomputer users. Such experienced and\nenthusiastic users would be expected to\nhave little problem with the systems\ndesigned to manage the fund holding aspects of the practice (essentially\naccounting and tracking patients). This is\nnot the case.\nThe first problem lies in the\nspecification of the system. This was\ndrawn up by the Department of Health\nand sent to the system developers.\nSystems were then tested by consultants\nTouche Ross for 'conformance' to the\nspecification. Unfortunately, the designers\nof the specification clearly had no idea\nhow a real GP practice worked, what\ninformation was required or would be\navailable at which stage of the treatment.\nFor instance, the system asks for a The Audit Cube\nThe audit cube\nidentifies the issues\ninvolved in a nursing\naudit, sets them in the\ncontext of the whole\nNHS, and provides a guide against which\naudit progress can be\nmeasured.\nORGANISATIONAL AUDIT diagnosis from the GP before the patient\nis sent to the hospital or outpatient clinic.\nThis allows a sum of money to be\nearmarked from the GPs funds to pay for\nthat treatment. The doctor, however, is\nusually sending the patient to the hospital\nin order to obtain that precise diagnosis\nand at the time of referral cannot provide\nthe answer demanded by the software.\nOnce the patient reaches the hospital,\naccompanied by the vast amounts of data\nwhich are required by the department of\nhealth, the hospital usually throws most\nof this information out of the window,\nsince it has no use for it. The 'unique\nreferral number' given to each patient by\nthe system is meaningless to the hospital\nsystem, while the standard referral letter\ncontains no details of the contract\nnumber, which is what the hospital is\ninterested in. As Angie Daniels, Oxford\nregional primary care computing advisor,\nsaid at a recent seminar on primary care\ncomputing: \"Nobody thought to share the\nspecification with the hospitals.\" Another\nconsequence is that necessary information\nis not flowing back from the hospitals to\nthe fund holders. Apart from these problems, some users\nhave discovered that passing the\nconformance test did not guarantee that\ntheir system would actually work on 1\nApril 1991. At least one system did not\nand several of the others are very\nunstable, particularly in their interaction\nwith other GP system such as patient\nregisters. This instability is undoubtedly\nthe result of the speed with which the\nsystems were developed (around six\nmonths in most cases) and the\ninadequacies of the specification, which\nappears to have been aimed at\naccountants rather than software\ndesigners. There have also been\ncomplaints of inadequate training and a lack of basic accounting understanding by\nsystem suppliers.\nThere are some good aspects to the\nreforms. The NHS does need better\ninformation that will allow both managers\nand clinicians to make sound judgements\nabout patient care. But the way the\nreforms have been implemented, the\nspeed, and the sacrifice of real needs to\npolitical expediency will not help the NHS\nface its future. Baroness Cumberledge, a leading Conservative health policy\nadvisor, told a conference of health\nservice managers earlier this month that\nthe NHS was in danger. Its 'board of\ndirectors' is Parliament, she explained,\nand Parliament was dominated by the\n\"two-swords length that separates the\ngovernment and the opposition\". The\nNHS is being used to score political\npoints. It should be more important than\nthat: it is an important national resource\nand it deserves better than to be kicked\nabout like a football between the children\nat Westminster.\n\n"

    "content": "Holding Up Half\nIn the aftermath of the Gulf War, as the\nUnited States and its allies slip\ncomfortably into their designated roles in\nPresident Bush's 'New World Order',\nanother silent and deadly scenario is\nbeing waged in the Third World: it is the\nongoing struggle against under-development. In January 1990, the United\nNations affirmed development as a human\nright. However, as Western aid is\ndiverted to Eastern Europe, following\nfundamental changes in the political\nclimate, there, the prospects of bridging\nthe North-South divide seem ever remote\nand the issue of development, particularly\nthe subject of women and development,\nremains one of much concern and debate.\nAn Essay on Women in\nDevelopment by Natasha\nShoaib:\nWomen are at the heart of development:\nthey not only control much of the non-money economy (subsistence agriculture,\nbearing and raising children, domestic\nlabour) but also play a vital part in the\nmoney economy (trading, the informal\nsector, wage employment). Women's contribution is central to development\nand costs of ignoring the needs of women\nare uncontrolled population growth, high\ninfant mortality, a weakened economy,\nineffective agriculture and a generally\npoorer quality of life. Improvement in the\nsituation of women is closely linked to\nother objectives, namely those aimed at\nreducing poverty. In fact, improving the\nstatus of women is probably the most\nbasic way of improving general living\nstandards in a community\u2014in short\ninvesting in women means investing in\ndevelopment itself.\nMany women in developing countries\nare still trapped in a web of traditional\nvalues, with few choices other than\nmarriage and bearing children. They tend\nto have large families because a woman's status and achievements are linked to her\nrole as a mother and because children\nare regarded as an insurance policy in\nold age. However, implementation of\nfamily planning is f avi our able to the\nhealth of mothers and children, to the\nimprovement of family life and to raising\nthe cultural and technological status of\nwomen. In fact family planning is an\nessential prerequisite for achieving real\nequality between men and women.\nMost people now agree that poverty\nand rapid population growth are closely\nlinked and need to be tackled together.\nThere is also growing concern over the\nissue of population growth and\nenvironmental damage: ever increasing\nnumbers of poor people in developing\ncountries have been forced, in order to\nsurvive, to use up resources which could\nsustain them in the future, and the effects\nof environmental degradation are felt\nmost acutely by women, for it is they\nwho must walk further to search for\nfirewood and unpolluted water. An\nestimated seventy percent of India's groundwater is polluted with toxic waste\nand sewage, and deforestation and\nirrigation projects have left an estimated\n23,000 villagers without drinking water.\nIn parts of Central America even breast\nmilk was found to be poisoned by\npesticides. The deterioration of the rural\nenvironment has led to urban growth, the\nconsequences of which are an issue of\nconsiderable concern because the massive\nconsumption of resources and production\nof waste in towns and cities has already\ncaused major pollution and environmental\nproblems. Urbanisation is partly due to\nthe men leaving the countryside to find\nemployment in the cities and has resulted\nin the growing number of female headed\nhouseholds\u2014needless to say these\nhouseholds are amongst the poorest in\nthe world.\nDiscrimination against women starts at\na young age, for many it starts at\nchildhood\u2014parents with limited resources\ngive more to their sons than to their\ndaughters. Many studies have shown that,\ndue to a girls inferior status, boys are fed\nbetter than girls and girls are more likely\nto be malnourished in times of famine.\nParents have greater expectations of their\nsons, even though their daughters start\nwork at an earlier age and work harder\nthan their sons. However a woman's contribution is seen as less valuable as it\nconstitutes less to the family income (in\nmany cases, women's wages are less than\nmen's, even when they do the same\nwork).\nThe discrimination against women\ncontinues as they grow older. The\navailable data on literacy and education\nsuggests that a wide range of levels of\nliteracy and educational attainment exist\namongst women in developing countries.\nAlthough the majority of women in Latin\nAmerica are literate, more than two\nthirds of the women in African countries\nare illiterate. Generally, fewer women\nthan men are literate, and as literacy is\nclosely associated with participation in\nsome aspects of development, the gap\nbetween the sexes will suggest the extent\nto which men and women participate in\nthe development process. In addition to\nbasic literacy, the level of education\nattainment is also important, as very few\nwomen (compared to men) complete\nsecondary school, which is a prerequisite\nto more financially rewarding work.\nVery often, the work that women to\ngoes unrecognised and women's participation in the economy is frequently\nunder-reported in the usual statistical\nsystems because of their involvement in\nthe informal sector and because of their\nstatus as unpaid family work es. Recent\nsurveys in a number of South American\ncities indicate that the labour force\nparticipation rates of women are\nconsiderably higher than the\ncorresponding rates reported in national\ncensuses. Most statistics suggest that\nwomen's roles are at best supplementary,\nwhen in fact, many women are heads of\nthe Sky\nhouseholds, with full responsibility for\ntheir own and their children's survival.\nThe overwhelming majority of women in\ndeveloping countries live in rural areas\nand their contribution to agriculture is\nenormous: women are responsible for\nsixty to eighty per cent of the food\ngrown in Africa; one survey of village\nwomen in Pakistan found them working\nsixty-three hours per week; in Rwanda\nwomen were found to work three times\nas much as men. Studies documenting\nrural women's 'invisibility' have increased,\nbut there is still a shortage of vital\ninformation. National data collection\nsystems do not yet accurately document\nwomen's contribution to development.\nThe development of quantitative and\nqualitative data on women will enable the\n'fine tuning' of policy interventions\ncurrently being used, some of which have\nbeen shown to have a negative impact on\nbeen encouraged by the IMF and the\nWorld Bank, the two main sources of\nfunds. The role of the IMF is to help\ngovernments with financial difficulties\nmanage their budget deficit and balance\nof payments by way of short term one or\ntwo years loans. In return the country\nconcerned must implement corrective\nmeasures such as the devaluation of\ncurrency and cuts in public expenditure.\nThe World Bank is primarily charged\nwith improving a countries' productive\ncapacity and promoting growth and\ndevelopment through 'Structural\nAdjustment Loans', targeted at mobil ising domestic resources, improving the\nallocation and use of resources,\ninstitutional strengthening, and, as\nmentioned above, reforming economic\nincentives. Structural adjustment involves,\namongst other things, the realignment of\nprices through the exchange rate and an\nFEATURES\nincrease the price of export crops have\nresulted, in many cases, in a shift from\nsub sistance farming to cash crops and has\nmeant that control of the crop has passed\nto men, as they (and not the women) are\nroutinely given training, credit and\ntechnology. And what about those\nwomen and men who are unable, for\nwhatever reason, to shift production to a more lucrative product? For them, the\npoverty inducing effects of adjustment\ncould be more than just short term.\nWhy is it so important that women's needs are recognised and specifically\nincluded in development policies? Firstly,\nif the goal is to produce social and\neconomic transformation, then the\nexclusion of one social group on the basis\nof sex will certainly sabotage those aims\nand there will be specific socio-economic\nrepercussions for those who are excluded.\nSecondly, targeting women as a women. Students of economic\ndevelopment have dealt a major blow to\nmodernisation theory by demonstrating\nthat the benefits of development do not\naccrue equally to men and women. This\nhas been the basis for exploring the\ngender impact of macro-economic policy.\nVariations in the instruments of macroeconomic policy (the exchange rate, fiscal\nand monetary policy etc) influence the\ncosts and benefits of different economic\nactivities. In recent years, with the debt\ncrisis in many developing countries, the\nincentives for the production of tr ad able versus non-tr ad able goods have increased.\nManufactured good, internationally traded\nfoodstuffs and close substitutes of imports\nare examples of tr ad able s; construction\nand personal services are examples of\nnon-tr ad able s. This reform of economic activities has\nincrease int he price of tr ad able versus\nnon-tr ad able goods, with the intention of\nchanging production incentives. There is\nnow growing concern over the short-term\npoverty inducing effects of structural\nadjustment. Removal of food price\ncontrols and an increase in the price of\nconsumer goods is felt immediately on\nthe demand side, whereas the increased\nincentive to produce takes more time to\nwork. Thus any increase in income will\nonly come about after a lag, and the\ninitial fall in wages affects women more\nacutely.\nAgriculture is typically targeted for\nstructural adjustment programmes. In Mali\nninety-one percent of all women are in\nagriculture; in Zaire the figure is ninety-four percent and in India seventy percent.\nThus the issue of the impact of women is\nimportant. Policies that selectively\ndevelopment priority will not end\npoverty, save the environment or ensure\npeace, but it will certainly make a crucial\ncontribution to these ends.\nIn this essay, I have tried to outline,\nvery briefly, what I feel are some of the\nimportant issues in what is often referred\nto as 'Women in Development', namely,\nfamily planning, the environment,\neducation, the importance of developing\nreliable indicators on the status of\nwomen, and gender and macro-economic\npolicy. This list is by no means\nexhaustive, and it is my firm belief that\ngrowth and development can only be\nachieved with the full and equal\nparticipation of women. Finally, the more\none studies women at the bottom of the\nhierarchy the more strongly one feels\nthat no-one needs emancipation, equality\nand development more than they.\n\n"

    "content": "With the deadline fast approaching for the second meeting in Madrid to\nsign the protocol, banning Antarctic mining for 50 years, Christopher Riley\nreviews the speculation and history of negotiations which have clouded\nthe issue, and asks if there really is anything to fight over beneath the ice?\nENYIRO\nthan provide a tantalizing glimpse of the\nseven major sedimentary basins which\nsurround the continent. Of these seas the\nWeddell Sea is thought to contain the\nthickest successions of sediments. At over\nten kilometres these offer the most\npotential for yielding hydrocarbons,\nexplains Dr MacDonald, senior\nsediment o logi st for the British Antarctic\nSurvey. However, the sea is plagued by\nthe world's most hazardous pack ice,\nmaking any extraction almost impossible.\nAccess into the Ross Sea is far easier\nalthough the sedimentary sequences in\nthis basin are only four kilometres thick\nand to date, only methane and ethane\nhave been detected by the deep sea\ndrilling project. Such results provide little\nsupport to the claims of the 45 billion\nbarrels of oil that the continental shelves'\nare estimated to contain.\nPerhaps the most speculated sites of\nAntarctic mineral potential are its iron\nformations and coal bearing strata. The\niron formations of Mac Robertson Land,\nEnderby Land, Wilkes Land and Dronning\nMaud Land are dwarfed by those of\nWestern Australia and Brazil. Even the\nimportance of the coal in the\nTransantarctic and Prince Charles\nMountains has been exaggerated. Located\nhundreds of kilometres inland from ice\nbound seas it is thought that such\nresources could never compete with the\nabundance of more accessible, better\nstudied, better quality deposits elsewhere\nin the world.\nIndications of copper are common on\nthe Antarctic Peninsula. There are\nnumerous reports in early literature of\nspectacular bright green malachite and\nblue azur it e stained outcrops. In fact such\noccurrences are the source of rash\nAntarctic place names such as\n\"Coppermines Peninsula\". Frequently the\norigin of such staining is little above the\nbackground levels of copper in the crust.\nThe Dufek massif (a layered igneous\nintrusion in the Pensacola Mountains) is\noften compared with the Bushveld\nComplex in Southern Africa and regarded\nas highly prospective for nickel, cobalt,\nchromium, platinum, vanadium and other\nplatinum group elements (PGEs). The\nPGEs speculated from this tentative\nparallel have become a reality through\nmedia exaggeration. Only three percent\nof the Dufek intrusion is exposed and this\nhas only been studied for a few weeks in\nthe field. From a few unrepresentative\nhand samples it is suggested that the\nunexposed three kilometres may contain\nPGE deposits perhaps within 100 metres\nof the surface. The limited data available\nsuggests that there are more differences\nthan similarities between the two\nintrusions. Their differing ages,\ngeo chemist ries and origins all reduce the\nlegitimacy of comparisons. The rocks of\nthe Shetland Islands seem just as likely to\ncontain PGEs as the Dufek massive. The\nonly real test is by extensive grid drilling.\nBut with speculation at such a high level\nand the chances of discovering the\ncomplex to be barren, equally as high,\nsuch a drilling programme cannot be\njustified.\nJohn Hughes of RTZ explains that for\nAntarctic mining to become economically\npossible, the inflated market prices would\nrender many other low grade deposits\nelsewhere in the world exploit able. This\nwould postpone the need for Antarctic\nmining further. There is still plenty of\nunexplored crust left. Each new survey\nreveals new mineral potential which was\npreviously unknown.\nDespite this, the time will surely come\nwhen depletion of the Earth's easily\naccessible crust will necessitate Antarctic\nexploitation. If ever this position is\nreached, present rates of pollution will\nhave rendered the world uninhabitable,\nglobal warming will have destroyed\ntodays polar environments and Antarctic\nexploitation will be immaterial. The most\nimmediate threat facing Antarctica is not\nthe possibility of local mineral\nexploration, but the effects of global\npollution. The industrial northern\nhemisphere which drives the demand for\nexploitation is responsible for the ozone\ndepletion and the CO increase which\njeopardizes Antarctica's and hence the\nplanet's future. Comparison of Antarctic\naerial photographs, taken thirty five years\napart, show that in places the snow has\nreceded forty metres. Whether this is just\na cyclic ebb and flow of the ice sheet, or\na permanent man-induced change might\nnot be discovered until it is too late.\nAnother perhaps less publicised threat\nto the continent is that of tourism.\nFor a little over \u00a311,000 a Canadian\ntrekking company offers a19 day\nexpedition to climb Mount Vinson. Some\n3,000 tourists come to Antarctica annually\nfor skiing and mountain climbing. During\nthe past 25 years 'adventure tourism' in\nNepal has grown from 10,000 to 250,000\na year. Without proper controls on litter\nand sewage the Himalayan trek ker transmitted plague of discarded plastic\nbags and used toilet rolls will infect the\nSouth Pole as well.\nAntarctic science has a global\nimportance in describing, understanding,\nmonitoring and predicting changes that\neffect the whole world. There is a general\nconsensus that preservation of the\nAntarctic environment and mining are\nincompatible. The inevitable accidents,\nchronic pollution and habitat\nencroachment would destroy the\nwilderness and these scientific values.\nAntarctica has already suffered its first\nenvironmental disaster. Early in 1989 the\nArgentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran\naground near Palmer Station.\nThousands of gallons of fuel fouled\nbeaches and killed wildlife.\nBut we should not be too quick to point\nthe accusing finger. We are all at fault. It\nis the consumers that feed the industrial\nmachine. The new emphasis on the\nenvironment as the ultimate resource\ndemands a re-education of todays\nconsumer society. All of us in the\nindustrial world are already using too\nmuch energy. It is up to every individual\nto do justice to their planet.\n\n"

    "content": "News Review 90-91\nAccommodatio n Clayponds and Montpelier Hall are two\nnames which have been linked\nthroughout the year. In separate deals, so\nit is claimed, the College was to sell\nMontpelier for at least \u00a37 million and\nfinance the building of a new estate in\nSouth Ealing, Clayponds, for \u00a311 million.\nThe sale of Montpelier, however, was a fiasco. At first the students were told they\nwould have to leave before Christmas,\nthen the deal was delayed and they were\ngiven a reprieve. It was up to Felix,\nhowever, to tell them this.\nClayponds went ahead, even though the\nCollege had, as yet, not received any\nmoney from Montpelier. This sale was\nwrecked when it was discovered in the\ndeeds that the building could only be\nused for educational purposes. Sir Eric, in\nthe Rector's question time recently, said\nthat 'we've made a terrible mess of it', a feeling echoed by those who have been\nleft in uncertainty over exactly how long\nthey had left at Montpelier.\nNow the first residents have moved into\nClayponds, and very nice it is too. It just\nseems strange that College should be\nbuying a whole new estate when the\nAccommodation Office is deeply in debt.\nPerhaps it is hoped that by raising a large\namount in new rents, the \u00a320.5 million\naccommodation deficit may be paid off.\nHence the steep rent rises proposed for\nnext year.\nDissatisfaction over levels of rent\nreached unprecedented levels when\nresidents of many halls were asked to\npay full rent over the Easter vacation or\nempty their rooms. This was done\nwithout the consultation of the wardens\nand was seen by many students as a way\nof making a fast buck.\nAs for next year, increases include a rise in deposits from \u00a350 to \u00a375 and a lengthening of the period of notice to a term. This will make it far more difficult\nto move out of a College room. Residents\nwill also be asked to pay for 34 weeks\ninstead of 31 in many halls. Consultation\nbetween Paul Shanley and Gordon\nMarshall over a proposed rent increase\nfrom \u00a346 to \u00a352 p/w has made the later\nlose face. Mr Marshall shall henceforth\nnot be handling rents.\nThere is another problem with\naccommodation, that of ageing buildings.\nSouthside should be condemned in a few\nyears time, having been built 29 years\nago, with an intended lifespan of 25\nyears. It is unlikely that the College will\nbe allowed to build such a monstrosity\nagain, which means that a large sum of\nmoney will be needed to finance a hall of\nthe same size. Of course a smaller hall\ncould be built, or the land used for other\npurposes, but the student population have\na heed for more purpose built\naccommodation near to College, not less.\nOngoing Sagas\nThe future of the careers service at\nImperial is looking bleak with the\nplanned d is affiliation from the University\nof London Careers Advisory Service\n(ULCAS). The Rector took what he said\nwas a purely managerial decision to\nbreak contact with ULCAS, consulting\nonly Mr Angus Fraser, College's Managing\nDirector, and not the student\nrepresentatives. There are fears that this\nmove will reduce careers advice in non-scientific areas since the Rector is known\nto favour graduates moving into jobs of a technical nature.\nClaimed benefits of d is affiliation include\nsimplification of the management\nstructure, but Russ Clarke, IC's chief\ncareers advisor from ULCAS believes the\nservice provided to students could suffer.\nUnsurprisingly, the move was initiated\nwhen the College was asked to pay more\nmoney for the service. They had been\nreceiving ULCAS support at a reduced\nrate due to a quirk in university funding\nprocedures. Funny how money\nconsiderations overrule that of students.\nQueen Mary and Westfield College took\ndrastic action to save money - it has\ndecided to close at least one department\nand severely curtail others. Up to 400\njobs may be lost in the next five years as\nthe hospital restructures in the process of\nbecoming self-governing. The action\ngroup there expects the Government to\nclose one London teaching hospital. This\nwould have a severe effect, not only on\npatient care, but on training for the\nfuture.\nThe College announced a new science\npark to be built at Duffryn, South Wales.\nThe first building is likely to be a \u00a32\nmillion technology center called 'Imperial\nHouse'. Research projects form a large\npart of Imperial's income, \u00a339 million for\nthe 1989/90 period. Does all this money\nhave to go back into research? One\nwould have hoped that part could be\nused to pay off the massive\naccommodation debt. That kind of\ntransaction is illegal under Government\nregulations, but as the Rector said about\nmissing lectures; 'its's been done before'.\nCollege Security\nTheft has been a major problem all year,\ncontributing to the news again and again.\nUnfortunately the Union building is still as\ninsecure as it was this time last year and\nrandom thefts are increasing.\nThe biggest movers during the year\nhave been bikes. Plugging D locks has\nmade no impression on students. The\nCollege in general is an area of rich\npickings with departments being totally\ninsecure. Many cheque books and cards\nhave been stolen from offices and from\nthe Union. On three occasions this year\nBenjamin Turner, ICU Deputy President,\ngave chase and successfully gained their\ncollars. In the words of the local nick, it's more than they have had! Although I support students and staff being wary, it\nshould not be their responsibility to\nprotect the College.\nEven the College Ambulance was\nbroken into and \u00a3500 of emergency\nequipment stolen. Included in the items\ntaken was Nitrous Oxide. Known more\ncommonly as laughing gas it was\nprobably intended for personal use.\nAnother College vehicle, a mail van, left\nunattended for a few minutes, was stolen\nand driven to Peckham. It seemed that\nmost of the post, apart from six\nregistered packets, was untouched. The\ndriver was chastised but security\ncommented that the theft was 'one of\nthose things'.\n\n"

This is not because he identifies\nwith penguins (right down to emulating their\nskill at chess), but because he has openly\nstated that he liked some of my issues.\nStrangely enough it appears that penguins,\ndespite being very bad at chess, are actually\nquite nifty little graphic designers, as Stef is\nresponsible for most of the icons in Felix this\nyear. They also apparently take to the things\nthat need to be done in a Felix office in much\nthe same way that they don't to sea-lions.\nHe is also very talented at destroying\ncomputerised cities.\nAnna( Current News Editor and Token Woman)\nAnna wants to be a journalist. I mean she\nreally really wants to be a journalist. With all\nher heart.\nShame really.\n(1 don't really mean it. Honest.)\nAdam( Generally Good Bloke and Former Arts Editor)\nAdam T is as near to being a perfect student\nstaff member as anyone I 've ever met. Losing\nhim due to his exams and appointment as\neditor of CUB (the student magazine at QMW\nwhere he now studies) was a huge body blow\nboth to myself and to Felix.\nHe has worked ridiculously hard for Felix\nthis year, despite not even being at Imperial\nand having to travel for an hour to get here.\nHe can do just about anything that is needed\nof him: Paste-up, camera work, typesetting, not\nsleeping, write the nice bits about me in the\n'Staff on Editor', and go on comic buying trips\non Fridays after getting up really early to help\nme distribute (the fact that he was often\nsleeping on my floor having nothing to do with\nthis). He also reads some really cool comics,\nand he bought me a drink once, and...\nI'm sorry. I tried to think of something nasty.\nHonest.\nMatt and Sumit (Current Arts Editor)\nThese two have been grouped together for the\nsimple reason that they share the same brain.\nUnder Adam T they worked as reviewers, and\nwhen he resigned they leapt into the gap with\nmore gusto than a particularly suicidal\nlemming who has watched far too many bad\nAmerican TV shows, and was under the\ninfluence of various recreational\npharmaceuticals, mainly those of amphetamine\ndescent. Which is roughly how they describe\nthemselves when writing reviews.\nExcept for the bit about the bad TV shows.\nMike( Sex Starved Books Editor)\nMike is one of those people that 1 could have a real heyday with. 1 could be really nasty,\ntotally rip him to pieces.\nBut it's much more fun to let him wonder\nwhat 1 could have written.\nSarah (Former Music Editor)\nSarah was one of the staff members from the\nold school (ie she's left). She originally decided\nto stand for the non-s abb editor, but in a flash\nof neural activity far too impressive for a potential editor she realised that if she got the\npost she'd actually have to be seen in the day.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing for your\naverage human, but Sarah belongs to that\nvague sub-species, the 'Goffs'. As such she had\nspent painstaking hours not going out in the\nday, avoiding exposure to any form of solar\nradiation, and generally working up a nice\nunhealthy pallor. So she decided to stay\nnocturnal (ie do the music pages).\nShe's also damn good at lot's of other stuff\n(like paste-up), but as she left without telling\nme what was getting her down, I'm not going\nto say that.\nJohn( Current Music Editor)\nI have a feeling that John is in fact an alien.\nHe's far too good at being music editor to\nreally be a physics fresher. He's also stolen one\nof earths women, and he's into indie music.\nWhat makes it really suspicious is that he's actually nice to me.\nAnd I 've never seen him without his cap on.\nDom( Music Reviewer and Ed this issue)\nDom is the guy responsible for those really\nweird bits that appear in the music pages\nalmost of their own accord. He is also a pro\nMC-5 fan, and full time hippie.\nRoland (Former Features Editor, Current\nwhereabouts unknown)\nRoland was the man responsible for the cover\nof my first issue of Felix. I think that just about\nexplains why he hasn't been seen in recent\nmonths.\nEither the rest of the staff got him, or he's still in hiding.\nIan (Former Science Editor, H anger-On)\nIan Hodge, or as he doesn't like to be called\n(but everyone does anyway), 'BODGE',\noriginally decided to stand for non-sabbatical\neditor. However, he was persuaded by the rest\nof the staff that he really shouldn't stand, as\nthe job was very strenuous, and what with the\nweak heart he didn't actually have, it wouldn't actually kill him, so he shouldn't do it.\nAfter this he seemed to lose interest in doing\nany work for Felix.\nRichard (Rumoured Photo Editor)\nWho?\nJonty, Nige, Dave and James( Reviewers,\nNews People, General Bods, Hacker)\nThese three are the kind of people we need far\nmore of. They aren't concerned with just one\nsection, but do whatever is needed at the time.\nThey're all good blok es, and I love 'em to\ndeath.\nThis has nothing to do with the fact that\nthey haven't really been about long enough,\nand thus actually do things that I ask them.\n(James is the exception: He has been around\nlong enough, but still does what I ask him)\nChris Riley (Professional Tourist)\nChris has been everywhere in the world, and\nwritten articles for Felix about most of it. He is\nalso the only PhD student at IC who has ever\nwritten anything for us more than once.\nHe also has the annoying habit of being\nhappy all the time.\nKate and Louise (Err...)\nKate and Louise are not staff in the strict sense\nof the word. However, they have been very,\ner, accommodating to some of the other staff\nthroughout most of the last two terms. At this\npoint my natural instinct for self preservation is\nscreaming rather loudly into both of my ears .\nat the same time, so I think I 'll shut up.\nSteve (Head Collator, Video Supplier, and Professional Mug)\nSteve isn't so much a staff member as someone\nwho's far too gullible for his own good. He's turned up to almost every collating session,\nnormally with a VCR, TV, and assorted tapes\nfollowing dutifully behind. He never leaves\nbefore it's all done, which means he normally\nends up distributing.I could almost forgive him\nfor all the hassle he gives me.\nAlmost.\nJeremy( Business Manager, Advertising,\nand Part-Time Computer Tyrant)\nJeremy is the living incarnation of Karl Marx's worst nightmare. He has done such an\nexcellent job at organising the finances and\nadvertising this year that he has become one\nof the best examples of why communism is\ndoomed to failure. He is also one of the very\nfew people in the office who is totally frank\nwith me, which comes as a refreshing change\ncompared to most of the other Machiavellian\nplotters around here.\nUnfortunately he realised quite early on that\nas he isn't being paid he doesn't have to do\nanything I ask him to unless he really really\nwants to.\nRose and Andy( Typesetting, Printing, and\nWonderful Human Beings)\nI 've grouped these two together not because\nthey don't deserve separate sections, but\nbecause they deserve so much praise that I haven't got the space to say it all twice.\nIf Adam T is as near to a perfect student\nstaff member as I 've met, then Rose and Andy\nARE the perfect paid staff. They are both\nexcellent at their jobs, and no one in the office\nworks harder than they do. I couldn't say too\nmany good things about them. What makes it\nworse is that Andy is a hideously talented\nmusician, with a brilliant band, and both of\nthem are great people.\nI cannot adequately express my thanks to\nthem for the work they've done this year. I only hope that they both stay with Felix for a long time yet, as we would find it nearly\nimpossible to find two other people who are as\ngood at their jobs, and are willing to put up\nwith people like me. I know this all sounds\nhorribly gratuitous, but the worst thing is it's all true, and I mean every word. Thanks.\nChris( Former Editor Elect and Current\nProduction Manager)\nI 've left Chris until last because I don't really\nknow what to write. He's been a huge help to\nme throughout the entire year, both\nprofessionally and as a friend.\nI can't say he hasn't annoyed me at times, or\nthat he's always acted as I would have liked.\nBut the basic fact is that without him there\ncould not have been a regular Felix this year.\nWhenever I 've had exams it has been Chris\nwho's got the thing done while I 've been\ntrying to work. This issue would not have been\nproduced without him, as he's handled nearly\nthe whole thing (I 've got exams on Thursday\nand Friday).\nHe really deserved to be Editor this year,\nand I thank him for all the help he's given me,\nand all the work he's done both for Felix and\nas Print Unit Manager.\nHe's also a really cool guy.\nCheers Chris.\n52\n\n"

    "content": "News Review 90-91\nCollege Tyranny9 to 6.\nProposals to change the college day\nhave resurfaced throughout the year. A longer working day and staggered\nlunchtimes were firmly rejected by\nstudents at UGM, but the Rector, Sir Eric,\ncontinued to plug his cause throughout\nthe year.\nStudents have complained that a lengthened College day, even if the\nnumber of contact hours remain constant,\nwill create traveling problems and will\ninterfere with hall meals. There is also\nthe suspicion that departments will try to\ncram more work into the newly made\nspace. Additionally a staggered lunch\nhour will make it almost impossible for\nmany clubs and societies to operate in an\neffective and productive way.\nThe Rector brushed aside such\nobjections saying '...after all, just\noccasionally, one can skip a class-get a friend to take some notes. Going to\nlectures is much to be desired-but one\ncan make a few exceptions. It has\nbeen done before...'\nOn the subject of work, the Rector, Sir\nEric Ash, has been on record saying there\nis not enough maths on courses.\nEngineers say that the college might-as\nwell rename all courses 'applied\nmathematics' if any more is introduced.\nAffairs of the Rag\nThe most prominent feature of Rag this\nyear was the squabble between Imperial\nand Cardiff Universities. The chief\ncomplaint of Cardiff was that collecting\ncans had been appropriated into\nImperial's own collection. At first glance\nthis seems to be a petty charge since all\nof the money would eventually go to\ncharity. It emphasises, however, the\nsloppy way that cans were gathered at\nthe end of the day. For some time after\nthe event, rag cans were being found in\nodd corners of the Union building, some\nmarked, some not. If Imperial is to keep\nit's position as a rallying point for London\nand country wide rag organisations, it\nmust manage events such as these in a more professional way.\nPetty bickering aside, Rag has raised\nthousands of pounds this year, Monopoly\nand Tiddlywinking racking up \u00a36,000.\nPub crawls and the Beer Festival were\npopular, as was the Bar Quiz (yet again I must report without bias that Felix won\nhands down). The C&G Slave Auction\nraised over \u00a3700 but proved\ncontroversial, prompting an attack by\nSTOIC (Student Television Of Imperial\nCollege) on the outdated and sexist views\nprevailing in College.\nThe Rag Fete did not fair so well. It\nhad a poor turnout and raised little\nmoney, due to a lack of publicity and a move from it's normal venue, the Queen's Lawn being abandoned due to College\nhaving removed the turf. Another\nexample of a well planned and executed\nevent due to mutual cooperation.\nThe Exec. Initiative proved that yet\nagain the Union Executive are a tenacious breed. Dropped outside\nStonehenge, the Exec, were to make their\nway back to college. Unfortunately for\nthe organisers, their minibus was stolen\nby the Hon Sec, Murray Williamson who\nhad decided to return in style, showing,\nfor the first and last time, some initiative.\nThe Queens Tower's lions did not\nescape Rag stunts this year being suffused\nwith a cheery red glow. King's College\nwas suspected but the culprits are not\nknown. The occasion produced an\nunforgettable quote from Mr Reeves, 'If\nwe have to sandblast the lions much\nmore we'll end up with a couple of\nbloody mice'.\nConclusion\nThere is a general trend emerging that all\naspects of College and Union policy are\nbeing justified on financial grounds, rather\nthan on possible benefits to students.\nChange is often accompanied by the\nargument that 'it will bring more money\ninto the system which will filter back to\nstudents'. In reality, any extra revenue\ngained stays within the section wherein it\nwas created, propping up a research grant\nor sub sidi sing one club's activities rather\nthan benefiting students in general.\nThe Union now has it's own logo, but is\nstuck with it's old image. College has not\nseen fit to introduce anything new and\nmy research is going quite nicely\nthankyou.\nThe next few years will see the Union\nand College fighting with the problems of\naccommodation. The College is already\nseeing a reduction in intake which may\nbe directly accounted for by the high cost\nof living in London, exacerbated by the\ncurrent mismanagement of College\naccommodation. How the issue of\naccommodation is tacked by the Union\nwill strongly affect it's image and standing\nsince the decisions made will affect many\nstudents, both in the short term and for\nmany years to come.\n51\nWhich would you trust with &13.5K?

The Rector, Sir Eric Ash,\ntold Felix that 'we (the college) haven't done any market research - that was one\nof the deficiencies of our system.'\nFlying\nThe Royal College of Science Union aid\nexpedition to Romania, organised by\nMartin Heighway, has suffered a change\nof plan. The volunteers will go by air\ninstead of overland by bus. Mr Heighway\ntold Felix that 'we're still taking a lot of\nstuff ... like baby clothes and cuddly toys.'\nHe said that he was 'over the moon'\nabout the response to his appeal. A group\nof volunteers will leave for Zvoristia in\nMoldavia in about a week's time. Rag\nhave donated about \u00a31000 to the\nexpedition, but much more is required.\nAny donations - money or cuddly toys -would be gratefully received. Please\ncontact the RCSU office on 8675.\nBar\nResurrection\nThe Union bar acquired two new bar staff\nlast month. Andrew Flanagan took over\nfrom John Riding as Bar Manager and\nRamesh Patel was appointed Assistant Bar\nManager. Mr Riding only became\nmanager in September last year.\nWhen asked his name, Mr Flanagan\nanswered that he was still trying to find\nhimself, but later admitted to actually\nbeing the late Karen Carpenter. He was\nformally bar manager at Goldsmiths\nCollege and is looking forward to the\nchallenge of working here. 'There is a lot\nto do', he added, 'and an enormous\npotential. It will be fun to see how far we\ncan go. The Union is a good team'. He\nhas already held a Pimm's cocktail\nevening and has more events planned.\nRamesh Patel was formerly at St\nThomas' Hospital. He is an avid squash\nplayer and succeeded in beating Felix\nBusiness Manager, Jeremy Burnell, with\nease.\nRent Breakdown\nThe college has backed down on the its\nproposed increase in rent. The Rector, Sir\nEric Ash, told Felix that the college\nwould now receive about \u00a392,000 less\nfrom the residences than the original\nproposals suggested. This was done after\na 'lot of agonising discussion' between the\nUnion and the College, he added.\nThe Rector said that he had received\nassurances from Angus Fraser, the\nCollege's managing director, that the rent\nfor a single room in any college residence\nwould not exceed \u00a349.50. Sir Eric said\nthat he 'intended to sign on the dotted\nline' when the final rent proposals from\nMr Fraser are presented to him.\nThe Rector commended Gordon\nMarshall, Director of Estates, for his 'real\nattempt to put rents in a logical order',\ntaking into account such things as the\nlocal poll tax, travelling distance and\nquality of housing.\nThe Union's proposals would mainly\naffect residences around Prince's Gardens\nsite. Under their scheme a single room in\nSouthside would cost \u00a34 less per week\nthan the original college rents proposal. If\nthe college had adopted the union\nproposals unchanged the college would\nhave lost \u00a399,382 in revenue.\nThe catalyst for a re-examination of the\nproposed rent rises came from both the\nUnion and academic staff. Senior tutors\nand heads of department expressed\nconcern, formerly expressed in a letter to\nSir Eric, signed by a number of interested\nparties including A. J. Taylor-Russell, the\nChairman of the Admission Policy\nCommittee, T.J. Seller, the Director of the\nInternational Office, and D.M.L Goodgame, a College Tutor.\nThe signatories to the letter said they\nwere aware of the Rector's concern about\nthe financial difficulties of students and\nthat they were sure that he would not\nlike to encourage the view that 'Imperial\nCollege is widely perceived to be too\ncostly a place at which to study'. They\nexpressed worry at the effect on student\nnumbers though it would be 'difficult to\nquantify the extent, by which admission\nnumbers will be affected by the proposed\nhigher residence rent'. One of their\nconcluding comments was that there was\n'clear evidence from surveys undertaken\nby the registry and departments that\nac como dati on costs are a major reason\nfor potential students declining offers of\nplaces.'\nSir Eric told Felix that his 'hope is that\nthe increase in rents will have a close\nbearing on RPI', which is the inflation\nrate, and that 'my ultimate responsibility\nis that the college doesn't go broke.'\nLow Down\nLoos\nThe Peachtree survey conducted on\nbehalf of IC Union will be published in\nabout a week's time. The draft\nconclusions show that the Union building\nlavatories are considered the most serious\nproblem in the building; they actually put\nstudents off entering it. Improving the\nlavatories will cost an estimated \u00a38,000.\nA secondary problem concerns the\naccessibility of the union offices. There is\na proposal to relocate the union to the\npresent SCR (Senior Common Room) on\nthe first floor of the Union building. The\nSCR would be moved to the present\nUnion back office and the whole\nrelocation would cost about \u00a313,500.\nA number of other changes are in the\npipeline, though the funding has not been\nfully arranged. The Union lounge may be\nimproved and the concert hall may have\na gallery installed so that FilmSoc can\nshow films more often. This latter change\nwould cost about \u00a33,500. The upper\nkitchen in Southside may be converted to\na health suite, and catering will be moved\nto the weights room and the motor club\nstore. This would cause confusion as the\nMotor club have nowhere to go and\nSTOIC (IC Television) would not be able\nto move to Southside as previously\nplanned.\nHAIRDRESSERS15 A HARRINGTON ROAD, SOUTH KENSINGTON0718238968 We have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women\nCheck us out !\n\n"

(It's not really that\ninteresting anyway.)\nInfluenced by Elvis, Ricky Nelson, Fat\nMattress, Badfinger, Doug Sahm, all the\nusual Country-rock bands and a million\nothers, the band are currently getting it\ntogether and have just re or ded a single\nfor July release on Heavenly Records.\nEntitled 'Good Day To You' it will be as to rmer even if it's only half as good as\nthe live version, which, frankly, storms.\nHaving now got a fair sized crowd\ncoming to their London shows they're\nstarting to get a following outta town as\nwell y which was compounded by getting\nthe support slot on the Johnathan\nRichman tour.\nSo Rockingbirds, let's talk some more;\ndo you think there's an audience for you\nwith this noise scene that's going on?\n'We make our own audiences, we don't expect a ready-made one, but with this\nnoise-scene there's just a lack of\nalternatives. Sometimes the music press\nare interested in promoting crap bands,\nbut let's face it most bands are crap\naren't they?'\nWe agree.\n'It's just that they have to sell music\npapers so they have to make out that\nthere's something worth writing about.\nObviously there were prime movers in\nthe scene, like My Bloody Valentine, but\nI 've never understood why people want\nto go home and form a band that sounds\nexactly the same. It's got to the point\nwhere you go into Virgin Records and\nyou can't find anything you like because\nthe racks are full of rubbish.'\nWe most definitely agree again since\nthere are far too many of these\nChapterhouse, Slowdive types around for\nour liking. What about the other bands\non your label?\n'Everyone on Heavenly ploughs their\nown furrow, like The Manic Street\nPreachers and Flowered Up, oh yeah! and\nEast Village'\nEveryone starts laughing at this point as\nEast Village write songs about the autumn\nand flowers, though the band say they're\ngood geezers and were instrumental in\ngetting them a deal.\n'We're not interested in appealing to\nthe country-rock crowd, we just want to\nbe played on Radio 1 and tour the world.'\nWhat do you think about Satan's most\nevil creation\u2014the Compact Disc?\n'Well there's nothing you can do about\nit now. I much prefer LP's, but I'd quite\nlike a CD player if anyone's got one\ngoing since that's the only way you can\nget a lot of music now. What I really\nthink is a shame is the demise of the 7\"\nsingle. It was such a great format.'\nLuddites that we are, we dispute the\nmerits of a CD player and rave about the\n7\" single, but talk turns to money.\n'None, enough to put petrol in the\nTransit.'\nWhat's it been like hanging out with\nJohnathan?\n'Well he doesn't really hang out since\nhe's got his own mates, but he stays\naround and has a chat after the show.'\nWe talk about Johnathan some more\nand they tell us how they still can't quite\nbelieve they've been supporting him. We\ntalk about the crummy dressing room and\nthey remark that they plan on painting\nup the dressing rooms when they go on\ntour.\nAndy is the mu so and talks about\npentatonic majors and blues scales which\nmeans absolutely zilch to me and\neveryone laughs. He then tries to deny\nthat he'samu so, but I don't know if 1\nbelieve him. Alan writes all the lyrics and\nRockingbirds\nis 'not the person to write political lyrics'\nsince they are a pop band.\nAfter the soundcheck we nat ter some\nmore about people, places and rehearsing\nwhilst tripping. They are too poor to\nafford drugs at the moment, but luckily\nsome turn up from somewhere, where-1-don't know etc...and the interview\ncrumbles with sustained bouts of giggling\nand much debate over the musical merits\nof Fat Mattress. I learn that when they go\non tour they want a travelling show with\nthem, jugglers, NO! make that 'no fucking\njugglers'\u2014and fire-eaters, proper ones of\ncourse, Johnathan Richman comes in with\nhis guitar and tells us anecdotes about the\nVelvet Underground\u2014he's a friend of\nthem all\u2014and we are impressed. He is\nvery funny but doesn't do interviews, the\nband play a stomp in' and a storm in' set\nand pass out on the bus home.\nThe Byrds a rockin'; we have no picture of The\n36\n\n"

    "content": "BJ on Fridays Ents FELIX\n'Why don't we end the year with a really\nbig bang, and really go out in style!!?'\nsaid the best Ents team ever assembled,\nso we sat down and got to it.\nSo now on Friday 21st June, the last\nday of term, the Ents crew have lined up\nan un surpass able treat for you lucky IC\nstudents. One of the biggest, most\nhappening bands around at the moment\nwill be playing at IC (a band even Lise\nYates may like), the Paris Angels.\nFor anyone who has not got an ear to\nthe ground the Paris Angels are the band\nresponsible for the massive dancefloor hit\nPerfume (All on You) which has been\nplayed at Libido every Wednesday and\nFriday, and many other top London\nnights out. Although they stem from\nManchester they are different to the run\nof the mill bands from this part of the\ncountry. Their music is mainly dance\norientated but retains the bagginess\nwhich encapsulated all the good parts of\nthe now defunct Manchester scene.\nImperial College is very lucky to play\nhost to the only London College date for\nthis band (after they pulled out of the\nSummer work plans\ncome unstuck? Why\nnot try UROP (the\nUndergraduate Research\nOpportunities\nProgramme)? Booklet\navailable (free) from\nUROP Office, Room\n313C, Level 3, Mech Eng\nBuilding.\nDO YOU SPEAK\nFLUENT\nMANDARIN?\nIF SO, I NEED YOUR HELP FOR1/2 HOUR. WILL PAY. CONTACT JOHN AT FELIX OFFICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\nULU date due to other commitments).\nOver the last few months the band has\nattracted so much media and public\nattention that most dates on their recent\ntour have been sold out, including the\nNew Cross Venue and the International in\nhometown Manchester. This means this is\na pristine date, so much so that the gig\nhas been moved to the Union Concert\nHall (from the Lounge) usually only\nreserved for carnivals. Support on the\nnight comes from the superb Spinning\nJenny, who stem from the Ride/Catherine\nWheel ilk of bands. A very recent signing\nand definitely the name to watch (just\nlike 1 said for Leviathan, Catherine Wheel\nand Soul Family Sensation who all played\nat IC this year).\nDoors open at 9pm and the admission\nprice is \u00a33 (as opposed to \u00a37 at the\nVenue (New Cross). Tickets are only\navailable from the door and are on a first\ncome first served basis, as there are only\na few hundred more than a usual Lounge\ngigAs well as the bands there will be\nmany other forms of entertainment so\nthat the end of the year spectacular is\nlike a carnival. This will include a late\nbar extension and drinks promotion, Ents\ndisco (of a very high quality) with many\nnew and special effects in the Concert\nHall, and others to be confirmed. So my\nadvice to you is to put on your dancing\nshoes, your drinking trousers/skirt and\none of your best tapping tops and ease\non down to the Union on Friday night!\nAs this is the last article I will write I would like to take this opportunity, on\nbehalf of the whole Ents team, to say a big thanks to: The Union staff, the\nsabbaticals and everyone else who has\nmade the Ents shows possible. And of\ncourse to you, the students who have\nmade doing Ents this year a real laugh especially the Links Club and Ian\nWagstaff. Hopefully we have made the\nUnion a better place for you to come to\nand have a good time and let your hair\ndown. Normal Ents service will resume in\nFreshers Week. Good luck!\nBJ (Ents Chair 89/91, 90/91)\nYOU'RE BOUND,\nAt STA Travel, we're all seasoned travellers so we should know a thing or two\nabout where you're headed. And because we know the travel business backwards,\nwe can offer you the best deals on fares - even the flexibility to change your mind as\nyou go, without having to pay over the top for the privilege.

If this sounds like\nyou, read on...\nThis summer three expeditions leave\nImperial College for the four corners of\nthe world. George Beccaloni a third year\nbiologist is leading a party of scientists to\nMadagascar to study the ornithology.\nRachel Pears is the Imperial College\ncoordinator for a joint British Universities\ndiving expedition to the Galapagos\nIslands, and Chris Riley and John Rogers\nare the 1991 British Trans-Atlas Mountain\nBike Expedition which plans to cycle\nacross Morocco.\nRachel Pears expedition has a large\nparty and requires the largest budget;\nalmost \u00a320,000. Such sums of money are\nnot easy to raise, and this has been the\nbiggest headache during the present\nrecession, explained Rachel.\nThe Trans-Atlas Mountain Bike\nExpedition is the smallest proposal with\ncosts being kept to a minimum.\nPatronised by the College Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, and explorer and travel writer, Dr\nRichard Crane, the ride is to raise money\nfor a Scholarship fund for North African\nstudents to come and study at Imperial.\nThe whole expedition is running on\nunder \u00a31000 for both members. This\nincludes purchase of any vital equipment\nnot supplied through sponsorship. Their\nglossy prospectus was printed and\ndistributed in January. 'Initially response\nwas slow, and it looked like we would be\ncycling across the Atlas on a pair of Usecurity locks, supplied by Citadel'\nexplained Chris. 'Since then nearly 70 of\nthe 240 companies have replied, some\ntwice. Sixteen of these have offered\nsupport. The extent of this has varied\nfrom simply a copy of their catalogue, to\ngenerous discounts of between 10% and\n55%. Nikwax, the Waterproofing\ncompany has offered to supply their\nproducts for free. Saracen and Marin\nhave offered 33% of their bikes, and\nDawes, a generous 50%. Cyclopath, a supplier of cycle clothing run by Emyr\nGriffiths and based in South Wales have\noffered the very durable New Zealand\nTika cycle-luggage, as well as bike\ncarrying straps and special leather handlebar grips. To make comparisons,\nCarradice have supplied their panniers\nwhich convert to a rucksack.'\nThe two man expedition hopes to cover\nthe 800 miles in four weeks, and plans to\nmake the first ascent of the south face of\nMount Toubkal, (3,625m high), by bike.\n'The biggest problems we will probably\nencounter, is finding clean water to drink\nalong the way. Other problems I 've been\ntold about include the drug sellers who\nforce you to buy their hashish at gun\npoint, for the police to confiscate it and\nfine you up the road.'\nChris and John leave at the beginning\nof September, to avoid the searing\nsummer temperatures on the fringes of\nthe Sahara, where they start. 'If all goes\nto plan, we should be back by the\nbeginning of September', said Chris.
