This weekend RAG are going to attempt the virtually\nimpossible, the incredibly\ndangerous, the most reckless feat\never undertaken. In pairs, tied\ntogether for a modicum of safety,\nyour mission (should you choose to\naccept) is to climb a completely\nhorizontal pavement, from the\nVictoria and Albert Museum, along\nBrompton Road, past Harrods, all\nthe way to Hyde Park. Yet more\ntourists will again be deprived of\ntheir cash as they are amazed by our\nintrepid adventurers. All money\nraised will go to the Royal\nAssociation for Deaf People. The\nperilous proceedings will cease\nwhen we reach the Hyde Park Base\nCamp for a massive picnic, so don't forget to bring your rations!\nHopefully we will be able to\narrange some hot food to greet you\nwith too. There are prizes for the\nbest fancy dress and climbing gear,\nand the charity are offering aCD player for the best collector, so the\nrisks are worthwhile! Meet at Beit\nArch at 10.30am tomorrow\n(Saturday) or come to the RAG meeting at 1.10pm in the Ents\nLounge opposite Da Vinci's today\nto find out more, if you are brave\nenough to attempt the impossible!\nQPR 2, Leeds 1, RAG \u00a3 9 4 0 . 0 7\nLast Saturday a group of 14 r aggies too lazy to get up at 8.30 to go to\nCambridge and too stingy to pay\n\u00a310 to get into a football match went\nup to Leftus Rd and armed with\nRAG Mags and cans terror is ed both\nsets of fans. This was all an attempt\nto con them out of money for\nMEN CAP and worked very well\n(look at the score for yourselves).\nFree lunch was provided by 'The\nSandwich Shop' - Gloucester Rd.\nWe collected for an hour and a half\nbefore kick off, found ourselves\nCALLING ALL BUNGEE JUMPERS!

Forms are still available\nif you don't already have one, and\nthe jump is free if you raise over\n\u00a3100 in sponsorship.\nMonopoly Revisited\nSince the last issue of Felix more\nmoney has come in, bringing the\nfinal total for Monopoly to \u00a34660.\nWell done to everybody who\ncollected. The top seven teams,\nwho all received AZ sightseeing\nguides to London were: 'Norfolk\nand Chance', 'Chuck and Chris',\n'The Tarts', 'Lonely Hearts',\n'Undecided', 'Mo, Steve and Rob'\nand 'The Superteam'. The top\ncollectors also received bottles of\nwine. Any members of the winning\nteams who have not collected their\nprizes yet should either attend the\nRag meeting on Friday in the Union\nLounge at 1.10pm or come up to the\nRAG office any lunchtime.\n. . . AND THANKS TO... Other people besides students help\nICU RAG collect money for\ncharity. The local community\naround Kensington provide help,\nservices and prizes for RAG events.\nSome of the places that have helped\nRAG recently have been: Harleys\nPharmacy (near South Ken tube)\nand Boots in Knightsbridge, who\nprovided films for Monopoly, Fast\nFoto Centre in Knightsbridge Green\nwho processed them, The Sandwich\nShop and Fileric on Gloucester\nRoad who fed collectors at the QPR\nvs Leeds, football game on Saturday\n24th October. Further afield,\nNadia's Patisserie, Burger King\nand Pizza Land in Cambridge fed\nthe Rag Raiders last Saturday.\nFinally, Dunkin Donuts in\nPiccadilly gave dozens of free\ndonuts to the Tiddlywinkers.\nThanks to all of them and any and\nall who gave to Rag.\nRag Rocky Horror\nDisco\nLet your alter ego out.\nNeed I say any more? Maybe I ought to for any uninitiated virgins\nout there. Rocky Horror is a strange\nmusical film concerning transvestite\naliens from the planet Transylvania,\nof the galaxy Transsexual, here on\nEarth to deprave, corrupt and\nentertain. We show the film, you\ndress up in drag (if you want to) and\nafterwards everyone gets down to\ndance to such classics as The\nTimewarp and Sweet Transvestite.\nDon't worry if you've never seen\nthe film, turn up anyway. A night\nof enlightenment and fun is\nguaranteed. The venue is the Union\nBuilding. Doors open at 7.30pm and the film will commence at\n8.00pm in both Da Vinci's and the\nEnts Lounge. Disco starts at 9.30ish in the Ents Lounge and the film will\nbe repeated all night in Da Vinci's. Entrance is only \u00a32 and there are\ndiscounts for appropriate fancy\ndress (stockings, suspenders,\nbasques, come on don't tell me you\ndon't know what drag means!) and\nalso for the day's courageous\ncollectors.

    "content": "N ews\n30 October 1992 Felix 946\nFleming Chair Goldsmith House\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School\nhave announced a new appointment\nto the Fleming Chair of Medical\nMicrobiology. Dr Douglas Young,\nwho is currently a Senior Scientist\nat the Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool researching tuberculosis and\nrelated infections, will begin work\nat St Mary's in October 1993.\nThe work of the thirty-eight year\nold Dr Young could result in major\nimprovements in testing for drug\nresistant tuberculosis. He is also\nchairman of the steering committee\nfor the World Health Organisation\nprogramme, IM MY C, promoting\nresearch into the immunological\naspects of leprosy.\nThe Dean of St Mary's, Professor\nPeter Richards, welcomed the\nappointment of Dr Young, saying\nthat 'It is only fitting that this key\nnational chair be taken up by\nsomeone of Dr Young's experience\nand calibre.'\nEsso Support\nThis week, Esso provided the\nDepartment of Chemical\nEngineering and Chemical\nTechnology with \u00a321,000 to fund\na new design office, which will be\nnamed after the company. The\nmoney was awarded after the\nDepartment succes fully bid for\nfunds under Esso's Higher\nEducation Support Scheme, and\ncontributes to the Chemical\nEngineering Jubilee Appeal\nlaunched by the Department in\n1990, which has already raised\n\u00a3300,000.\nThe office will have it's own\ndedicated network of computer\nworkstations where students can\nlearn to develop complete\npreliminary plant designs, based on\nactual case studies provided by\nEsso. The head of Department,\nProfessor Bill Wakeham\ncommented, 'We are delighted by\nEsso's contribution which will go\ntowards ensuring that the facilities\nin the Department continue to be\nsecond to none.'\nCollege has hired an external\nagency to locate property in the\nlocal area for a new residence. The\ncompany has been called in after\nattempts by the college itself to find\na suitable property proved\nunsuccessful. The money for the\nhouse, which is expected to cost in\nthe region of \u00a3300,000 including\nrefurbishment is mainly going to be\nprovided by the Worshipful\nCompany of Goldsmiths, who\nrecently made a sizeable donation\nto the college for this purpose.\nThe new house is planned to\naccomodate up to eight students,\nand the college Estates Manager,\nMr N. Black, commented that the\n'intention is to enable scholars to\nlive at moderate rents'. It is\nbelieved that the potential residents\nwill be nominated by their\ndepartments and selected on the\nbasis of academic merit.\nDespite considerable advertising\nfor suitable property, there has so\nfar been no success in finding a property entirely suitable for the\npurpose, resulting in a local\nproperty expert being contracted to\ndraw up a shortlist of approximately\n10-12 properties which may be\nsuitable. The Rector, Sir Eric Ash,\nis believed to be very interested in\nthe project.\nStreeter Banned\nRichard Streeter, House Committee\nChairman, has been banned from\nthe Union Building until Christmas.\nThe banning follows a Union\ndisciplinary hearing into the\ndisappearance of a Union minibus.\nFelix has been informed that Mr Streeter borrowed a Union minibus\nwhen it had been booked by another\nperson. The keys to the bus were\ngiven to a third person by a Union\nduty officer some days before. Mr\nStreeter has also been banned from\ndriving any Union minibus for an\nindefinite period. As a result of the\nban, meetings of the Union House\ncommittee will take place outside of\nthe Union building, with Mr Streeter continuing to hold the post\nof House chairman.\nVoluntary Membership Timetable Announced\nby Declan Curry\nVoluntary membership will be\nintroduced before January 1994.\nJohn Patten, the Secretary of State\nfor Education, has announced that\nhe will legislate for the voluntary\nprinciple 'in the next session' of\nparliament. Ministerial sources\nhave indicated that a green\nconsultation paper will be issued in\nOctober 1993, and a white\nlegislative paper will be brought\nbefore the House of Commons in\nJanuary 1994. The Department for\nEducation has also confirmed that\nSTUDENT\nACCOMMODATION OFFICE\nIMPORTANT\nNOTICE\nOn Tuesday 3rd November 1992\nThe Waiting List for College Halls\nwill close\nFrom Wednesday 4th November\n1992\nVacant rooms will be advertised in the\nAccommodation Office and will be\nallocated on a first come first served\nbasis.\nministerial consultations on\nvoluntary membership are still\ncontinuing, though on an ad hoc\nbasis.\nThe Education Secretary was\nspeaking at a rally of Conservative\nStudents in the House of Commons\nlast week. Mr Patten told the\nmeeting that he had been\nencouraged to introduce voluntary\nmembership by students 'of all\npolitical persuasions'. 'Sensible\nstudents say the NUS (National\nUnion of Students) closed shop\nmust go', he said. 'It is an affront\nthat we have the last closed shop in\nyour world'. Mr Patten added that\nhe would make a further substantial\nannouncement on voluntary\nmembership around Christmas. His\nrecent speech to the Conservative\nParty conference was criticised for\nnot differentiating between campus\nunions and the national union, and\nfor not detailing the specific\nlegislation he hopes to use to\nintroduce the voluntary principle.\nThe Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals (CVCP)\nhas warned the Secretary of State\nthat he will encounter substantial\ndifficulties in his attempts to draw\nup voluntary membership\nlegislation. At some colleges, the\nexistence of the campus student\nunion is set out in the statute and\ncharter setting up the college. These\ndocuments have a legal status of\ntheir own, and in some cases they\nhave a legal standing equal to that\nof legislation passed by parliament.\nIf the voluntary principle were to\nbe introduced, the charters of most\nhigher education institutions in the\ncountry would have to be changed\non an individual basis. This would\nusually be done by a body of\nuniversity commissioners, and\nforcing through change would\nbecome a lengthy process. David\nAnderson Evans, of the CVC P, has\ntold /'CNN that ministers couldn't 'bugger around with charters and\nstatutes without going through the\nPrivy Council', effectively\nWestminster's politburo. Conor\nPickering, the national director of\nConservative Students, told /CNN\nthat legislation would not be a 'question of central government\ninterfering with individual\ninstitutions'. Jan Moore, of the\nDepartment for Education, said that\n'ministers have already made it\nclear that they wish to introduce the\nvoluntary principle. They have no\nreason to suppose that the\nprovisions of university charters\nwill prevent them from\nimplementing their policy'.\nThe imminence of the\nintroduction of voluntary\nmembership is concentrating the\nminds of senior NUS sabbaticals.\nThe Presidents of all NUS affiliated\ncampus unions met recently in\nWarwick University to plan a 'campaign of action' against\nvoluntary membership. The\nmeeting was also attended by senior\nfigures from NUS's Holloway Road\nheadquarters. The sabbaticals\ndecided on what they termed a 'positive campaign of union\npromotion in preference to a negative campaign' of\ndemonstrations and protests. The\nNUS strategy has three main\nstrands, the promotion of students'\nunions to members, an attack on the\nvoluntary principle, and a national\nlobbying campaign. The first wave\nof lobbying has already been\nconcluded, with Lorna Fitzsimons,\nthe NUS President, attending both\nthe Labour and Conservative Party\nconferences. A campaign of student\nunion promotion is already being\nplanned by sabbaticals at Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU), and Chris\nDavidson, ICU President, has\nalready announced that he will be\nmeeting Nigel Forman, the Higher\nEducation minister, in the coming\nweeks.\nPage 2\n\n"

The\nfilm fluctuates from banal and\nrepetitive to cracking ly gripping.\nThough more play than a film, and\nin the present climate, a very\ndepressing one at that, see it for the\nacting.

While Proteus remains in\nVerona, held by his love for Julia,\nValentine travels to Milan where he\nfalls in love with the Duke's daughter, Sylvia.\nProteus is sent to Milan by his\nfather. There, he instantly forgets\nJulia and sets out to betray his friend\nby seducing Sylvia.\nThe play has been updated and is\nset in the 1930s where the\natmosphere created is both\nsophisticated and fun.\nPortrayed in this era, the action\nis extremely easy for the audience\nto relate to. It is set to a delightful\narray of Cole Porter songs which\nyou'll find yourself humming for\nweeks.\nThis play is worth seeing for one\ncharacter alone.

Violist Shebaldi and Cellist\nBerliusky are the originals and\nthough in their seventies, play with\nan und i mr ned youthful vitality and\nlightness missing from the newer\nviolinists Koplman and leader\nAbramenkov. Opening with\nBeethoven's intense F minor Op 95,\nskill, experience and concentration\nbreed an ease which carried the\nthree Allegro movements to\nsparkling heights. The lyricism of\nthe final Larghetto-Espressivo was\nbreathtaking. An inspired\nprogramme lead to Shostakovich\nNo. 13 in B Flat Op 138. A potential nightmare in many other\nhands, discords and tonal lunacies\nflourished into witty, wonderful\nsound pictures and electric rhythms.\nThe Schubert of the second half\n(D804 in A minor and D707 in C minor) lacked restraint. Complacent\nensemble playing, dynamic surges,\nunnecessary glissandi and\nmisplaced, mannered, soloist ic flourishes from the leader showed\nthe sugar-sweet writing at its worst.\nThat aside these are masters of their\ncraft, catch them next time, this is\nthe stuff of music history.\nSara.\n\u2022 Barbican, EC2, 071-638 8891.\nCelebrity Recital Series continues\nnext year.\nTheatre\nOur Song\nFollowing the success of Jeffrey\nBernard is Unwell, Peter O 'Toole\n(leading), Ned Sherrin (directing)\nand Keith Waterhouse (writing) are\nattempting another profitable\ncollaboration. This is not a good\nidea. The play charts the course of\nan affair between Roger Piper\n(O 'Toole) and the considerably\nyounger Angela Caxton (Tara\nFitzgerald) and the resultant havoc\nit causes to Piper's marriage,\ncareer, finances and liver until its\ninevitable end. The first attempts at\nrather brittle comedy, but the jokes\n(inevitably about sex) are old and\nweak. The second half is better and\nis partially successful in delineating\nthe intensity on both sides of the\nrelationship. O 'Toole gives a nice\nperformance as a lou che, middle-aged drunk; but it is all artifice and\nno feeling. Performing is too much\nin evidence. He also wears the\nnastiest suit I have seen in a long\ntime. In total, it is a disjointed play\nabout squalid characters who never\nsucceed in engaging interest.\nMatthew Hapold.\nArtists & Admirers\nThe talented but penniless young\nactress Alexandra Mikolavia\nNegina has to struggle for\nrecognition as her rich and\ninfluential admirers scheme to\nwreck her career after she has\nrejected advances by their most\nprominent member, Prince\nDulyebov. But, thanks to a keen and\ncalculating merchant rather than\nAlexandra's fervently idealistic\nfiance (a student), art wins over\ncorruption.\nAnyway, more interesting than\nthe somewhat disappointing plot\nwere the drama tis personae:\namiable, witty theatre-types, a student and an uneducated bunch of\naristocrats, nouveau-rich and\ngovernment officials. Ostrovsky's strength is character is ation and\ndialogue, which is well preserved\nin the new English version. This\nand the superb acting on all parts\nsave the production. Obviously an\nimportant figure in Russian\nliterature, but unlike Chekhov's, his\nplays have lost a lot of their impact\nover the last hundred years.

Please come and\nsupport us.\nIC extended their lead with the\nfirst touchdown of the season,\nprovided by Richard Stubbs,\nminutes before the Interval. The\nconversion was a formality.\nAfter the break and playing into\na strong wind, IC held their\nopponents out, before surging\nupfield with Melvin Aguh who\nreplaced Andrew Montgomery,\nwho left the field because of a groin\nstrain soon to be followed by Anton\nFields with a hurt knee. Paynter\nslotted the conversion to complete\nthe scoring and IC's first win of the\nseason.\nwell with a good drive and a converted try in the first five\nminutes. Kings, unfortunately came\nstraight back with a score and\ncontrolled the game from then on.\nIt was a disappointing loss but a hard game well fought until the last\nwhistle.\nIC Rugby meet every Sunday at\n12.30, Monday at 6.00 and\nTuesday at 12.00 in the Union\nGym, all players are welcome.\nVolleyball at IC\nDespite rather poor public relations,\nvolleyball is alive and kicking at\nImperial College, providing\npossibly the best example of\nexcellent athletes not being\ncompetent organisers. Last season\nIC was victorious in seven\nconsecutive matches in the U AU volleyball competition, only finally\nsuccumbing to Early Sunday\nMorning Blues at the Semi-finals\nstage against a less flamboyant\nManchester side, which had\nobviously spent less time on a thorough investigation of the Exeter\nnight life the previous evening.\nEven our veteran Hans Bavendiek,\nwho was later considered to be the\nbackbone of the British Universities\nteam found the hour did not befit the\noccasion and did not display the\nrelentless offence that had put and\nend to the ambitions of all other\nopposition. Imperial then threw\naway the bronze medal against a team they had beaten easily the day\nbefore.\nImperial players also formed the\nbackbone of the UL U teams, taking\nfour of the six full purples awarded\nfor volleyball this year. This was no\nmean achievement, given that after\na very convincing gold medal at the\nStudents Cup in Leeds, the London\nmen's squad has been described as\nthe strongest university side Britain\nhas ever seen. The squad's strength\nwas further underlined during the\nBUSF tournament, when three\nplayers could not attend, including\nIC captain Joel Ikdal and Swiss\nsenior and Czech junior\ninternationals Yves Cortellini and\nStepan Ruzicka, but the team still\nmanaged are sep c table4 th place,\nwhile the women took the bronze\nmedal, captained by IC's Kristina\nSagen.\nTrials will be held in the Imperial\nCollege Volleyball court (behind\nChemistry) from 7pm9 pm on\nMonday 2nd November. Training\nwill start with two sessions a week\nfor the ambitious and a casual\nsession for recreational players. The\nseason this year will get underway\nwith the first round of the U AU competition on the 24/25\nNovember.

Adrian, sweetly oblivious,\ntalks excitedly into the mouth piece,\nand seemingly unaware of the fact\nthat she cannot see him, gestures\nfrenetically with his hands.\n'Listen, Jilly, I 'll see you on\nTuesday at... g mm mph... a arc gh!'

He'll regret it.\n'Hey guys, does this like, remind\nyou of anything?'\n'Like what, Carver?'\n'It's just like being in the back of\na black cab, isn't it?'\nAdrian buries his head in his\nhands, but Guy likes the idea.\n'Well, yes, but our house might\nactually go south of the river at this\ntime of night.'\n'But would it go to Dulwich?'\n'Only if we tip well.'\nUnseen, Brian makes his way up\nthe street towards the house,\ndisbelief camping out on his face.\n'Yo, guys, what are you doing?'\n'Driver, driver, stop the cab!!'\n'Brian, how you doing?

In Case of Voluntary\nmembership \u2014break\nglass\nPrevention is better than cure; but\nit may be neither possible or\ndesirable to prevent the introduction\nof voluntary membership. The most\nwe can hope for, in my opinion, is\nan input into how the process is\nundertaken. It is safe to assume that\nsome sort of voluntary principle\nwill be undertaken. This assumption\nis not only prudent but essential.\nPreparation is the key. Our\nmasters have one hold over us;\nquite simply this is funding, but in\nmost cases, they see this as money\nwell spent. It is essential to convince\nour parent institutions of our worth.\nWe must be shown to be an efficient\nand effective way to give our\nstudents that elusive extra\n'something' that makes the\ndifference between an average and\na good education.\nHow do we prepare?. In\npreparing, we are changing; some\nwill have to change more than\nothers, but change we must. In\norder to make the change effective\nwe must identify what we are and\nwhat we want to become. We must\nquestion our place in the lives of our\nstudents, the role we have to play\nin the scheme of higher education\nand our relevance within that role.\n(Here is the controversial bit) As I see it, ideology has little place in a modern students union, we must\ninstead concentrate on two things:\n1) Making our students time at our\nuniversities more enjoyable.\nThrough their courses, their social\nlife, their ac como dati on etc. 2) To\nmake our students more\nemployable, although if we do a proper job of the former this will\nfollow.\nIn summary, we must look at\nways to become a customer focused\norganisation. This may sound like\na1980's guide to better business but\nit's more useful then the manic\nramblings of a1970's trade\nunionist.

I know this\nbecause the single 'Goodbye' has\nalready wormed its way into my\nbrain, and this was a song I initially\nthought to be a sub-standard\n'Reading, Writing and Arithmetic'\n(their delicate, enchanting first\nalbum).\nWhat 'Blind' is essentially, is\nmore of the same. If it was anything\nelse it would not be the Sundays.\nIndeed when they do diversify as on\nthe funky, aptly named 'What do\nyou think?' it is as if the Sundays\nthemselves are not sure of the\nanswer.\nHarriet Wheeler's voice is as\ncaptivating as ever although her\nlyrics sometimes sit uneasily within\nthe metre of the songs.\nDavid Gavurin's guitar echoes of\nboth Johnny Marr and the Cocteaus\nwhilst the understated drumming of\nPatrick Hannan is a delight\n(especially after having to endure\nthe RockSoc debacle last\nThursday).\nIt will probably be demeaning to\nthe Sundays for me to say that this\nis a 'nice' album but\nCrippledick.\n\u2022 Out now on Parlophone/EMI.\nFelix 946\ne views30 October 1992\nThe Frank and Walters: Yawn, and I 'll cut your head off.\nThe Frank and WaltersTrains, Boats & Planes\nFranks' debut album!

(If, of course, you\nhaven't got all these, then it's about\ntime you got your act in order. Off\nto Tower. Right now). So what's new in Frank City?\n'Trainspotters' evokes no\nreaction in me right now.\n'After All' is reason enough to\nbuy this album, twice. A gentle\nlilting Frank And Walters in full\neffect.\n'John And Sue' is an anthem for\nlonely people. Now that strikes a chord with me. Really it does. Sing\nit loud, lonely people. 'Bake Us A Song'? Writer's block, huh, Mr.\nFrank? 'Time': Time flies when\nyou're having fun. I'm not.\nThe final song, 'High And Low',\nis somehow reminiscent of REM's similarly titled track from 'Out Of\nTime', with a dose of\nschizophrenia.

    "content": "Point of Order\nDear Jonty,\nMy, such letters last week. One\nin particular caught my eye, that\nfrom Mike Castles of ICU Pro Life.\nMike mentioned the Irish\nConstitution. Allow me to add to\nthe sum of human knowledge on\nthat one.\nMike says that the Irish\nconstitution accords equal rights to\nthe unborn child and to the mother.\nThis is indeed true. The English\ntranslation of the Irish original,\nwhich technically has no legal\nstanding in itself, reads:\n'The State acknowledges the right\nAftertaste\nDear Jonty,\nAfter reading Alan Bailey's letter\non 'Nobby the Sheep', I was left\nwith a bitter after-taste. Unlike Mr Bailey, I am in a better position to\njudge the article in question. This\nis because I am a Muslim and he is\na self-confessed atheist and\nprobably does not even have a clue\nabout Islam or what Islam means!\nHowever, there were a few points\nthat I did agree on with Alan. When\nI was handed the article, and I read\nthe title, the first thing that came to\nmind was the soft lovable character\nthat comes on the children's Saturday morning programme on\nto life of the unborn and, with due\nregard to the equal right to life of\nthe mother, guarantees in its laws\nto respect, and, as far as\npracticable, by its laws to defend\nand vindicate that right'\nThis is all well and good, except\nthat the equal right to life of the\nmother was only defined by this\nyear's Supreme Court judgement in\nthe X case. Before then, the article\nwas taken as guaranteeing the right\nto life of the child above all else,\nand with the mother as an\nafterthought. Indeed, the thrust of\nsome of the abortion campaigning\nITV ('Ghost Train'). I really can't see how the author decided to put\nthis title with his bizarre story. If\nthe author did intend, in good faith,\nto put across moral points\u2014then he\nfailed. I found the story to be quite\ncrude and it was an unsubtle\napproach to change the reader's way-of-life for the better. The\narticle must have been written some\ntime ago hence the opening\nparagraph contained the word\n'polytechnic' which is a thing of the\npast now. The Islamic Society\nshould have at least read it once\nbefore publishing it and so could\nhave realised how pathetic the story\nFelix 946\nin Ireland at the moment is to\nincrease the right to life of the child,\nand to hell or Connaught with the\nright to life of the mother.\nIncidentally, in the last\nreferendum campaign in 1983, antiabortion campaigners said that a raped girl would not be refused an\nabortion. They lied then, they're at\nit again this year. The December\n3rd referendum is anxiously\nawaited.\nKeep up the good work.\nYours in the sunrise of\nfreelancing,\nDeclan Curry.\nwas.\nI feel that the Islamic Society\nshould spend some time on\neducating people like Mr Bailey,\nthat Islam was one of the first\nreligions to give women rights. It\nis not the fault of Islam that the men\nin power such as in Saudi Arabia,\nwish to misuse these rights. If Mr Bailey wishes to 'talk' about\ncivilisation 'then maybe I should\ninform him that it was the West that\nlearned about chivalry and\ncivilisation from the Muslims in the\nEast.\nYours sincerely,\nMiss S Ahmed.\nOpinion\n30 October 1992\nDear Jonty,\nCan I firstly congratulate the\nIndonesian Society for an excellent\nfood fair and cultural show which\nthey staged on Saturday 23rd October in the JCR and Great Hall.\nThe amount of work and effort\nwhich had been put in to arranging\nthe event was really impressive,\nespecially when one remembers that\nthis society was only started up a few years ago (1990 to my\nknowledge).\nAs always seems to be the case\nwith such events organised by the\noverseas students in this college, the\nnumber of home students present\nwas absolutely pathetic. At \u00a34 a ticket, the price was hardly\nextortionate, considering the\nportions of food and the quality of\nthe show.\nIn raising this issue at the Union\ncouncil meeting last year (during\nmy time as OSC Chairman) I was\ntold that home students may feel\ninhibited to attend such events as\nthey bele ive that they are solely\norganised for overseas students.\nCan I please stress that any event\norganised by a society in the\nOverseas Students Committee is not\njust for us but also for you.\nI hope all the home students will\nin future show more interest in the\nevents we (and I am talking about\n20% of the college) are trying to\norganise. Who knows, maybe they\nwill actually find some enjoyment\nout of it all.\nGaurang Chadha,\nOSC Chair 1991-92.\nCrossword by John Westwood\nSOLUTIONS TO CROSSWORD IN ISSUE 944 ACROSS: I. Ho\u00a7t,3.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\nFelix 946\nUnderwater\n30 October 1992\nGoing\n'We're here! Wow, a cold beer,\nthanks you're a life-saver.' these\nwere the first words uttered by one\nof the van drivers upon our arrival\nat Brenda's caravan site in Port\nGrimaud near St Tropez.\nFourteen or so IC Underwater\nClub members had just descended\non this beautiful spot of the med for\nsome therapeutic drinking and\nsunbathing, with diving thrown in\nas a diversion. After driving nonstop from London to St Tropez in\na Union Van and other vehicles the\ndriving teams needed the two weeks\nahead to recover for the journey\nhome, but Id egress. In the whole time there we only\nhad a day's rain so the\nsuntans/burns were quickly\nacquired, for some of us even factor\n15 ('Dulux emulsion') did not offer\nprotection.\nWe either ate out or barbecued\nanything we could find, from fish\nto aubergine s. Handy hint for\nlighting barbies quickly, even better\nthan petrol, use a diving cylinder,\nhowever care should be taken with\nthe valve control, unless you want\nto wander ao und the camp site1 looking for the charcoal, food etc...\nThe diving in the region varies\nfrom the good to the 'not bad' (the\nlatter is a phrase for great which\nwas used to wind up Jean-Noel).\nFor nature lovers the bay of St\nTropez offers ledges, walls and\nother lumps of geography in and on\nwhich wild life abounds, octopi,\nscorpion fish, lobsters, edible crabs\nand other yum mie stuff, shame that\nthe place is a nature reserve and\nthus the marine life lived to tell the\ntale.\nThe sea bed in the bay is littered\nwith small wrecks; as we found out\nwhen a pair of divers ignored the\nSkipper (Phil 'the bottle' from the\n'Club Equipe' diving centre) and\ndid not descend down the anchor\nline. Thus missing the intended\nwreck 'The Columbia' but had a quiet dive on a completely different\nwreck.\nThe Columbia kept causing\nproblems. As Doc. Bayley, our tour\norganiser (Dive Marshal) found out\nwhen he missed the wreck by being\nonly five feet away and not seeing\nit due to the crap kicked up by\nprevious divers.\nOne note-worthy wreck that Phil\ntook us to was 'Le Rubis', a French\nsub which appears at 20m down,\ngetting larger until one lands on the\ndeck at 40m. She is almost\ncompletely intact, her mine laying\nConga eels and big blue fish??\nbays are now the playing ground for\nBritish sized Conga eels (1.5m). Some of our more intrepid divers\nentered the sub (one at a time)\nthrough the conning tower. The\n. 'Rubis' has not been plundered, so\ngauges, big handles\n(torpedo/batteries/mines?) are still\nvisible, since they are brass they\nstill move, but thankfully all\nordinance has been removed. I was\nmost impressed by the intact light\nbulbs embedded in the rust of the\naft engine block.\nHowever our diving was not\nrestricted to just Phil's area of the\ncoast, down the coast at Le Lavandu\nresides the a fore mentioned JeanNoel, with his lemon yellow dive-boat and Gallic sense of humour.\nHe waxed lyrical about the wrecks\nin the area, hence the 'not bad'\ncomments given in reply to his\nenquiries on how we liked the site\nwe just dived.\nAdmittedly the 'Conga Barge' is\nworth a mention, as it is possibly\nthe best named wreck site ever. The\nwreck lies at 40+m and is the home\nand playground for a score of\ncongas. These beasts varied in two\nmajor ways from our native eels.\nOne of these is that they are tame\nand so don't stay in their holes, only\npoking out their heads to scare\ndivers, these cute fish swim free;\nthe other difference is that they\ndwarf most British congas, and\ndivers, by a few metres. As the\nbarge is their home the congas\nexpect the divers to either feed them\nor move out of the way. We were\nnot prepared for this, so some fast\nmano ev ring was required, handy\nhint (number 2) leap-frog g ing congas, due to their size and\nnumber of pseudo-teeth' is only a little less insane than leap-frog g ing unicorns.\nOff an island near the conga\nbarge lives another set of 'cuddly'\nfish; giant Groupers. Imagine, if\nyou will, a perch. Now make it the\nsize of a large Pit Bull. The overall\neffect is a fish big enough to\nswallow whole boiled eggs and likes\nto terror is e divers until it's fed.\nAt the end of this particular dive,\nRolf T am not insane, honest'\nTietema impressed the French with\nhis 'parachute', a boat signalling\ndevice which looks remarkably like\nan eight foot orange condom.\nRounding off our stay we\ncelebrated with a night dive in St\nTropez bay. As night diving\nrequires navigational skills I elected\nto be shore cover, compasses and\nI have come to the agreement that\nif I don't use them, they will not\npoint me in the wrong direction (see\nthe Easter Tour report). Shore\ncover means that I have to count the\ndivers in and out of the water and\nexplain to the locals, in my\n'amazing'\" French that the lights\nthey were seeing a hundred yards\nout in the bay were mad English\npeople swimming at nine metres\ndepth and that they were not\nharpooning everything in sight.\nThe return journey to London\nwent smoothly until Calais where\nwe had to wait for a Seacat. Once\nonboard we thought it would be\nplain sailing but no\u2014the tour was\nto end with some 'humour'. The\ncaptain announced that all\nwatertight doors had been sealed\nand that we would be leaving\nshortly. Half an hour later the call\ncame through that the 'bow visor'\nwas jammed and that tools were\nbeing sent for from the shore (bow\nvisor = front cargo doors?). A while later the restful sound of\nsledge-hammers be labour ing steel\nwas heard, followed some time later\nby the announcement that the\ndamaged section of the Visor' was\ngoing to be cut away. At this point\ncomments about donning diving kit\nwere overheard by the cabin crew\nwho, un surprisingly, had a total\nsense of humour failure.\nPeter Bowen, Biochem Room\n201\n' We are having a few problems\nwith one of our divers who insists\nthat they have no teeth, if so they\ncarry the bluff off perfectly.\n2\n'amazing' because the locals\nunderstood me.\nPage 14\n\n"

Been with the same\nboy/girlfriend so long and feel it's just routine?\nNo? Well, neither are we,\nactually. We have to admit,\nhowever, that we have found\nimmense satisfaction in a tasteless,\ncolourless liquid with no smell-it's good old London water and it's only been through seven other\npeople's kidneys (including, we\nsuppose, at some point, the kidneys\nof the writer of the 'Beit Back'\narticle in Felix 944). If that doesn't stimulate you, then try reading the\nnewspaper article published a couple of weeks ago which\ndescribed how an eighteen-year old\n'man' battered a five year-old girl\nto death with a baseball bat under\nthe illusion that she was an evil\nhorde of skeletons following him.\nEven if the LSD that he'd taken\ndoesn't fuck his mind, it has sure\nfucked the mind of that girl, since\nthe skull is not known for its\nresistance to high velocity impact.\nThat 'man' sure got a good trip\u2014\nto prison, where he now languishes\n(or maybe he floats, if he was able\nto get hold of some more LSD),\nhaving been sentenced to life\nimprisonment.\nAfter reading the article in Felix\n944, we got so enthusiastic that we\ntook our heads out of the sand and\nburied them deep into the\nEncyclopedia Britannica* to see if\nit could tell us where we could\npurchase some of this amazing fast-learning drug (if only it was\navailable at the beginning of every\nlecture, eh?). After ingestion of the\ninformation contained therein, we\nwondered why this miracle drug is\nnot available on every street corner\nand in every chemist at rock-bottom\nprices for consumption by the\ngeneral public. After all, wouldn't it be a great comfort, as you wander\ndown Oxford Street watching pink\nhippos and purple elephants\nbouncing along on the pavements to\nthe sounds of Gilbert and Sullivan\ngone mad, that everyone else is\nsharing those selfsame visions?\nWho needs virtual reality when you\ncan enter your own fantasy world\nin real life and kill real people?\nWouldn't that be more fun?\nThe writer of the article,\nnameless as he/she remains (for fear\nof retribution by 'The System'\u2014\nGeorge Orwell eat your heart out\u2014\nthe police or large green moron-eating monsters with huge bat like yellow wings which can fly through\nwalls?) effectively 'withheld the\ntruth' all the way through his/her\narticle. These missing bits of\ninformation, which are necessary\nfor any reasonable human being to\nreach a balanced viewpoint, shall be\nsupplied below.\n(Sceptics please note, these\nquotes are direct from the\nEncyclopedia Britannica.)\n\u2014 ' A second important\naspect...involves a change in the\nfeelings and the awareness of the\nself. The sense of personal identity\nis altered...The person may feel\nempty inside, or he may believe that\nhe is the universe...increased\nsuspicion of the motives of others\nmay also become a factor.. .at times\nthe mood shifts...there can be a 'hellish' (their quotes) terror, gloom\nand a feeling of complete isolation.\nFor some people the experience is\nso disturbing that psychiatric\nhospital is ation is required' (our\nitalics).\n-'Laboratory studies...linked\nLSD to chromosomal and genetic\ndamage, thus intimating that future\ngenerations of the LSD user might\nbe subject to the fearful issue of\nmalformation and genetic illness'\n-'The user of LSD seems to have\nan almost fanatic need to prose ly tis e( convert) others to drug use.' Does\nthis remind you of anyone? (Hint:\nReal Felix issue 944).\n-'There is also a tendency on the\npart of those who take these drugs\n(Hallucinogens) to repeat the drug\nexperience and to experiment with\nother drugs.'\nIn summing up, we feel that Felix\nhas not only been used to satisfy the\nneeds of a few crazed LSD users to\nprose ly tis e, but as a jolly good\nadvert to inflict a potentially la thal drug on under informed and\nunsuspecting fresher s. Yours,\nSome concerned students.\nP.S. We wish to remain\nanonymous in fear of retribution by\n'The System', the police and large\nhash- (and God only knows what\nelse) smoking rugby players.\n*Reference: 'Encyclopedia\nBritannica Volume XIII pp 235-241\n('Alcohol and Drug Consumption')\nToo much truth? Islam\u2014the real story\nDear Jonty,\nAt the beginning of your year of\noffice, you stated that you would\nmake every effort to persuade\nauthors of controversial letters to\nput their name at the bottom. At the\nsame time, you are publishing 'Beit\nBack', a regular anonymous\ncolumn, claiming it was in your\nelection manifesto. Quite how you\ncan justify encouraging anonymous\nwriting in one section of Felix while\ndiscouraging it in another is difficult\nto see.\nNaturally, there are isolated cases\nwhere anonymity is justified. On\nthe whole however an anonymous\ncolumn encourages misinformation\nand lies. This point is clearly\nillustrated by the content of last\nweek's 'Beit Back' article,\nadvocating the use of LSD. The\nauthor claims he/she has not taken\nthe drug. Obviously it is something\nelse that is altering his/her\nperception of reality. Perhaps it is\nfeelings of persecution brought\nabout by the diabolically oppressive\n'system'? The author's suggestion\nthat even pure LSD( let alone that\navailable on the black market) is\nharmless, is not only naive but quite\nsimply untrue.\nDr Raanan Gillon, director of\nImperial College Health Centre said\nthat although some people will be\nunaffected after taking LSD, there\nis a 'significant risk' of 'long term\nmental disturbances' and long term\nside-effects of a psychotic nature'.\nWe realise that the readership are\nnot so impressionable that they will\ngo out and take LSD en masse after\nreading the article. The real damage\ndone, is that Felix and hence\nImperial College Union has been\nseen to be promoting illegal\nactivities, despite any disclaimer at\nthe end of the article. Imperial\nCollege Union IN NOWAY WHATSOEVER condones the use\nof ANY illegal drugs.\nWe understand that the idea\nbehind the article was to stimulate\ndebate, but would you initiate a debate on racism by printing an\narticle representing extremely racist\nviews? Perhaps not the best tack!\nWe urge you not to neglect the\nresponsibility that accompanies the\npower you wield as Felix editor.\nIt is the sensitivity of the subject\nof drug abuse that has driven us to\nwrite to you today, I suspect that\nmany of those who read the article\nin question will echo our concern.\nChris Davidson,\nRick Bilby.\nDear Jonathon,\n'Why are Muslims here, when\nthey disapprove so strongly of this\nsociety?'\nIt is a sad fact that there is no\nIslamic State anywhere in the World\ntoday\u2014even more sad than the fact\nthat most people are totally ignorant\nof this, as so beautifully\ndemonstrated by Mr Bailey in his\nletter. For example, the way Saudi\nArabia is run has very little to do\nwith Islam. (That is not just an\nopinion. It's a fact.) We cannot\nexpect those people to realise this\nwho see Islam as the 'Mad Mullahs'\nand 'wreck less Bedouins' who are\ngiven free publicity by the media\nand who are about as re pre se native of Islam as the British Royal Family\nis of ideal family values. Muslims\nhave to choose between countries\nrun by 'Hypocrites', or countries\nrun by 'Unbelievers'. Not an easy\nchoice.\nI do not support oppression of\neither sex in any country, but a good flues tion to ask about Western\nso cie ites is: 'If women are supposed\nto have such rosy lives here, then\nwhat is feminism all about?'. I wonder if Mr Bailey supports\nfeminism, or is this something else\nof which he says 'Who cares!'. But\nthat is another issue.\nAs for Salman Rushdie: in 'The\nSatanic Verses' he said plenty to\nenrage millions of people (but they\nwere Muslims). Mr Bailey was so\nen flamed by what was said in such\na small article by the Islamic\nSociety that he started to call for\nthese Muslims to be sent to Iran.\nAnd, I believe, this 'Nobby the\nSheep' article was banned, unlike\n'The Satanic Verses'. So much for\nfreedom of speech! I'm not even\nexpecting this letter to be printed.\nI have neglected to make a defence of Islam by presenting its\nprinciples. (It might have been too\ndetailed for the people I'd like to\nread this letter.) Those who really\nwant to know should come to the\nmany debates and lectures arranged\nspecifically for this purpose by the\nIslamic Society. Let sc ep tics see if\nthey can 'knock holes in Islam when\ntalking to real experts on the\nsubject. However, most people may\nsay 'Who cares' and go off to the\nbar. They are happy to remain in\na state of ignorance, unthinking:\nwhich is, perhaps, what the 'Nobby\nthe Sheep' article was all about.\nYours sincerely,\nAmir Rehman Khan.\nPage 4\n\n"

The victim believed that\nthe reason for the attack is that the\nattacker held a jealous grudge\nagainst her. A few days before the\nattack, the man came to Linstead\nHall uninvited. He was asked to\nleave by the victim after he made\nunwanted physical advances.\nOn Friday evening, the victim\nsays that the attacker walked into\nher bedroom while she was visiting\nthe room of a friend, having left her\ndoor unlocked. Later on when she\nreturned to her room, she was\nimmediately held at knife-point.\nThe knife was held against her face,\ncausing a large cut and bleeding to\noccur. In her own words; 'He\npushed me, something hit my head\nand after that everything went\nblank'.\nThe victim was found about half\nan hour later, unconscious, by a friend. The friend says that she\ncalled the sub-warden and between\nthem they revived her.

The girl alleges that the Doctor\nimplied that she had inflicted the\nwounds on herself. He, reportedly\nsaid he did not believe there had\nbeen any attack at all.

He\nmaintained the same story in his\nstatement to the police, also denying\nthe fact that she had had a bump on\nthe head.\nThe friends of the girl, however,\ninsist in their statements, that she\nwas accompanied at all times for the\nremainder of the night. Therefore\nshe would not have had any chance\nof wounding herself.\nReasons for this change of\nattitude of the doctor is considered\nto be part of a security cover-up.\nAttempts have been made by Felix\nreporters to obtain a statement from\nhim.

Basically, it was 10 weeks\nat the University of Delaware,\nworking on a research programme\nwith a salary of $2500. The culture\nshock and language difficulties were\nthrown in for free.\nDelaware, for those who don't know, is the smallest state on the\nmainland US, next to Pennsylvania\nand Maryland, about 120 miles\nsouth of New York.\nAnyhow, we arrived in Delaware\nin the last week in June. The\nac como dati on was a nice surprise\n- two bedroomed flat, air\nconditioning, fitted kitchen,\ntelephones, close to the university\netc. I pitied the American students\nwho got Southside over here.\nThe first experience of American\n'culture' was breakfast the next\nmorning. The waitresses were like\nflies - they wouldn't leave you\nalone. This is un-nerving coming\nfrom England where bad service is\nthe norm. When they say 'Have a nice day', try explaining that you\nhave other plans. This can confuse\nthem, especially if you can do a half\ndecent Hannibal Lecter grin.\nA synopsis of the country can be\ngained by watching the television.\nStuds will leave you with the idea\nthat most women are blonde, slim\nand incredibly stupid and that men\nthink with other parts of their\nanatomy than their heads.\nWith MTV, Home Shopping and\nthe televangelists you can be staring\nblankly at the screen for hours\nwithout consciously taking anything\nin. (A bit like a physics lecture!)\nThe televangelists are unbelievable\n- God regularly phones them from\nabove. I could have been healed of\nmy boredom, had I been arse d to\nget off the sofa, place my hands on\nthe TV screen and just believe. The\nsaving grace is that Cheers is on\nevery day.\nWork was another story. We\nwere in the School of Health\nSciences (Biochemistry to you).\nAmerican students don't get a lot of\nlaboratory practice during their\nscience courses, so the supervisors\ntended to treat you as if you hadn't got a clue. You can only endure this\nfor so long.

We ended up going to\na club on 5th Avenue where the\nbouncer was a Julian Clary look-alike, where the client elle were\nMafiosi Godfathers and bimbos and\nwhere the beds upstairs were open\nto anyone. It was weird, but it\ndidn't end there. Where in\nBrooklyn did we park the car? Why\nare we the only whites on the\nsubway? Why was the best looking\nwoman all night a transvestite?\nWhat are we doing here?\nIt wasn't always that exciting. We\ndid invent some amusing games to\nplay with the Americans:\n(a) Convince them you're related\nto the Royal Family and insist that\nthey call you 'Sir' and bow before\nspeaking to you.\n(b) Hire 'Young Ones' and\n'Blackadder' on video and try to\nteach them that these series' are\nfunny. There is a cable channel\nshowing 4 hours a night of 'Are\nYou Being Served?' which is\nregarded as a classic comedy.\n(c) Go into 'Bob's Big Boy' (a fast food chain) and ask for one as\nyou can imagine Rowan Atkinson\nwould.\n(d) Try keeping a straight face\nwhen someone comes up to you and\nsays 'Hi, I'm Randy.'\n,(e) Insult them by explaining how\n200 years of British Colonial Rule\nshould have taught them basic\nEnglish.\nOverall, it was good fun, and\nalthough we aren't dying to do it\nagain, it was a good opportunity to\nexperience a totally different\nlifestyle. We're now going to\nbecome EC Commissioners and\nclose Europe's borders to America.\nFinally, we flew Virgin Atlantic\nto and from the States and really\nwished we hadn't now. One of us\nwas jettisoned off onto an Air India,\nflight whilst the other was treated\nto a nine hour drunken extravaganza\ninstead of films and sleep.

I'm sure there is Zen in all of us. I did\nfeel a certain affinity with some of\nthe 'awareness' (my old school\nteacher would tell you that this has\nnothing to do with Zen, more with\nme being on another planet in the\nfirst place). Certainly I could relate\nto the simple number mantra having\ndone it myself and never realising\nit had Zen connotations.

    "content": "Felix 946\nReviews\n30 October 1992\nJoseph and the Amazing\nTechnicolor Dreamcoat\nAbout ten years ago Phil Schofield\nwas a mild-mannered man living in\nNew Zealand. He had the world at\nhis feet with a diploma in chiropody\nand the future looked rosy. Where\ndid it all go so horribly wrong for\nhim?\nIn 1983 Phil started fronting Kiwi\nPop Kid show Shazam, two years\nlater he became the straight man for\na puppet gopher and the story was\nalmost completed with a performance on the Children's Royal Variety Show. Then he met\nJason. I never believed it could\nhappen but right before my eyes on\nthe Palladium stage Phil stepped\ninto the shoes of a rock legend.\nSince Jason Donavan left\n'Joseph' (the show, not his alleged\nhomosexual lover) one might be\nforgiven for presuming that\nattendances would drop. Nothing of\nthe sort. Tonight, a Tuesday, the\ntheatre is once again packed. The\nshow opens with THAT song,\nadmittedly though 'Any Dream\nWill Do' sounds terrific sung by a hundred or so treacle-sweet\nchildren. Phil joins them to a huge\nwelcome from all present and I knew then I was in for a treat. By\nthe end of the song any doubts about\nthe boy Schofield's( he's30) voice\nhave been long forgotten and I'm completely en grose d until the\ninterval.\nThe Killing of Sister George\nIt were a lovely film, y 'know. Dear\nold Auntie Beryl Reid, overacting\nher dear old heart out and facing her\npastures new with stoicism and\ndread. Susannah York, her young\nlover, passionate and frightened.\nWould that I could say this play is\nnot a disappointment.\nIt shouldn't be; My problem with\nthe live theatre medium is that it is\nlive, and any attempt to ascribe\nsincerity, or many of the darker\nemotions grates just a little bit. It\nmay be my problem, but I don't think I'm the only one. I also missed\nthe free drink ies they give out to\npress bod s, but I digress. The leads\nhandled their roles competently\nenough; the decline of a popular\nradio soap star is handled with\nsensitivity and a modicum of very\nappropriate melodrama, and its shift\nfrom pathos to black comedy is\npoignant enough. I wish I'd been\ndrunk; I would have loved to see the\nmascara running in streaks down\nmy face.\nDavid\n\u2022 Baron's Ale House, 28\nComeragh Road W14. Box Office\n071-602 0235. Tickets \u00a3 5 , cones\n\u00a33.\nPhillip Schofield, a fine figure of a man.\nThe second half starts like the\nfirst half did, a babbling American\nbehind me has completely missed\nthe point and is dying to shout 'He's behind you' or 'Oh no he isn't' every time Phil appears on stage.\nIf he had done I would have\npunched him. The tourist is soon\nforgotten as Elvis appears in cameo\nas the Egyptian Pharoah and\nJoseph's brothers offer a calypso\nversion of the song Benjamin that\nthe Iron Lion from Zion himself\nwould have been proud of. The\nshow is wrapped up by a reprise of\n'Any Dream Will Do' during which\nJoseph is hoisted high into the air\nin glorious tech nicol our... brilliant\nstuff.\nIf you're still in any doubt about\ngoing to see this show, don't be.\nAnd don't think you'll stand out like\na grown-up amongst a teeny\naudience, the word got around long\nago that Joseph is too good to be\nwasted on children alone. By the\nend you'll feel like you've known\nall the songs all your life and\nalthough it'll ruin your hard earned\nstreet c red in the process, you'll be\ndeclaring your undying love and\nrespect for Phillip Schofield for\never more.\nMcCarter.\n\u2022 London Palladium, Argyl St\nW l.

I think it is very\nappropriate to exhibit pre-Hispanic\nart in this, the 500th anniversary of\nthe West's 'discovery' of America.\nI liked this exhibition. It is\ndivided geographically, and\nincludes a rich mix of art from the\nregions' cultures. The sculptures\nare very different from the stuff we\nwere doing at that time. They\ncertainly had a different idea of\nwhat a fertility goddess looked like!\nThe style is very plain, but not\nsimple.

One s Hp and it's homeward bound\u2014bump!\nUnfortunately both natures are\ndisplayed in this record.\nThe basic step-up is quite (dare\nthat word be used) nice. Vaguely\nceltic-folk y celtic-folk y arrangements of fiddle and\nharmonica are tightly structured and\nnot intrusive. The strum my guitar\nand vocal pastiche neatly interlink\nin a pleasant kind of way.

Their music is\nmere hard rock & roll, they could\nbe little brothers of the Black\nCrowes. Their words are hardly\nunderstandable, something about\ncrack-dealing school kids( 'Brand\nNew Amerika') and some irrelevant\nrelationship fuss (the two other\ntracks), but who cares anyway.\nThere is honestly absolutely nothing\nrevolutionary or exciting about the\nPoorboys ('ce pt for maybe their\nspelling of 'Amerika'), it's all been\nthere for eternity.\nBut I like it.\nYes, as long as there are\nand rog y ne mega stars only able to\ngive a concert with the electricity\nconsumption of a small town and as\nlong as my heart and soul are\nassaulted by machine gun computer\nrhythms every time I enter a disco,\nthere shall be hand-made, dirty,\nsimple, groovy rock 'n' roll like\nthat of the Poorboys, be it heard a thousand times before or not.

What are they so happy about?\nKingmaker\u2014Armchair\nAnarchist\nIt is difficult to imagine that just a few months ago, this band were\nbeing hailed as the brightest hope\nfor the future. British music,\nbecause this EP is really BORING.\nThis is the first time I 've heard\nanything by Kingmaker, so perhaps\nI was expecting a little too much;\nhowever, even if I wasn't expecting\nanything I would still be\ndisappointed with this record.\nThe song 'Armchair Anarchist' is\nkinda snide and sneering but it's clever-clever lyrics don't really do\nanything and the choruses 'Bomb\nthe idiots, bomb the idiots now',\nand 'Viva dynamite, viva dynamite\nOH!' sorta hint at right-on-ness but\nit's all a bit contrived and tame.\nThe music is probably even less\nnoteworthy than the lyrics\u2014all\npretty much standard indie guitar\nmusic, I guess. There's some nice\nchord yj an gly bits (oops, lapsing\ninto mu so jive there, sorry) here\nand there, but it's all pretty\nforgettable stuff.\nThe second song is called\n'Everything's Changed (since\nyou've been to London)' which is\nall about the supposedly corrupting\ninfluence of our beloved capital. I think they're just pissed off 'cos\nthey live in Hull!\nThe last song is called 'Kissing\nunder anaesthetic' which should be\ncalled 'Listening under anaesthetic'\nbecause you'd love to be knocked\nout to enjoy this record.\nMusic to snore to.\nJ Andelin.\n\u2022 Out now on Scorch/Chrysalis.\nMetallica \u2014 Wembley Arena\n25.10.92\nThe world's greatest heavy metal\nband hits Wembley for the first\nproper British date since when\u201489?\nToo long ago anyway.\nThis is the bit where I describe\nthe support band. Except that there\nwas none. We've heard limp\nexcuses like 'Well, Skid Row and\nFaith No More are the only hands\ngood enough, and they're too busy'\nbut so what?\nWhy not give an up-and-coming\nband a chance to reach a larger\naudience then?\nInstead, we get around twenty\nminutes of a crap video\nrockumentary (i.e. drunken\nAmerican fans being stupid) before\nEnnio Morricone's music from\n'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'\nheralds Metallica's arrival on\nstage\u2014where they would still be\nsome two and a half hours hence.\nOpeners 'Enter Sandman' and\n'Harvester of Sorrow' sounded\nweak\u2014perhaps the lack of support\nband resulted in a lack of\natmosphere and energy for the band\nto feed on (man)?\nWith 'Creeping Death', however,\nthe black-clad foursome were in\ntheir stride and, indeed, playing a blinder. Tighter than I have ever\nheard them, in fact, despite this only\nbeing James Hetfield's second show\nas guitarist since he incinerated his\nhand on stage some months ago.\nJason Newstead's bass solo was\na predictably tedious affair\ninvolving fuzzy bits and whale\nnoises. Lars Ulrich, obviously fed\nup with the drummer's traditional\nstationary role was able to race\naround on his mobile drum kit with\nall the speed and grace of an\narthritic tortoise, but thankfully\nthere was no drum solo.\nKirk Hammett managed to avoid\nthe symptoms of guitar solo tedium,\nbasing his solo around Deep\nPurple's 'Mistreated' whilst still\nhaving fun kicking his guitar down\nthe stairs. Infinitely better than the\nten minutes of high-speed wan king I was expecting.\n'Seek and Destroy' was an\ninteresting sing along extravaganza.\n'Fade to Black' and 'One' were art\nin its highest form and 'Whiplash'\nand 'Last Caress' were pure\nenergy. If I have seemed negative\nabout any individual parts of the\nevening, here are some of the\nsuperlatives I missed out:\nChoice, fine, rare, f elicit io us, excellent, admirable, first-rate,\nprime, crack, cardinal, super fine, super-excellent, exquisite, high,\ninestimable, incomparable,\ntranscendental, matchless, peerless,\ninimitable, but perfect?

The dull grey\nlight bathing the East End battled\nagainst the months of grime, and\neventually gave up dispirited.\n'It's still daylight,' I commented,\nde spar at ely hoping I had guessed\nright, 'We could still go and do\nsomething before Brian comes\nround.'\n'Yeah, like what?'\n'Well, Carver's always busy, ask\nhim.'\n'Carver, in case you haven't noticed, isn't here.

'Hmmph.'\n'Well?'\nT'm going for a fag.'\nI watched Guy take up his normal\nposition perched on the wall at the\nfront of the house, sucking hard on\nthe cancer stick. The summer\nholidays were really getting to him.\nOf the people we knew in London,\nvirtually none of us had found\nwork. Admittedly, one\nacquaintance had found himself a reasonably successful career as a male prostitute in a brothel, but\nthat, to be frank, was not an option\nthat appealed to many of us. Bar a brief week Adrian had spent\nworking for an accountant, none of\nus had managed to earn a penny\nsince term ended. One way or\nanother, we were scraping by\nfinancially, but the biggest problem\nwas boredom.\nCarver had been the least\naffected, having spent the last year\ndoing absolutely nothing and he\nseemed intent on doing even less in\nthe year to come.\n'Well, if I can, like, get through\nthe year OK, Patty will have\ngraduated, and she'll like set up her\nhippy commune, right?

No Travellers, no\nproblem?'\n'Errm...'\nT don't really think it's a problem, which ever way you look\nat it,' muses Adrian, lifting his head\nfrom the style pages of the latest\nGo. 'The Government might say\nthat they're going to clamp down,\nbut do you really think the civil\nservants in the dole office are going\nto be able to? I mean, don't they\nhave enough to do already?'\n'More every month,' I comment.\n'The recession's on you know, and\nnot everyone's rich enough not to\ncare.'\n'Hey, it's not as if I don't care.\nFor the unemployment figures to\ncome down, the recession's got to\nease, hasn't it?'\n'Yeeees...?'\n'Well, unemployment is a cost we\npay to lift us out of recession, so it\nwill, eventually cease to be a problem in of itself, so why worry.'\nHe leans back with that certain air\nof smugness that only Kenneth\nBaker has ever really mastered,\nleaving Carver looking confused.\n'Does that mean I 'll get the dole\nor what?'\n'Filthy scrounging lay about trash.'\nThe phone rings. We all make a dive for this brief flash of\nexcitement that has entered our\nlives, but Guy gets there first.\n'Hello, Clowns for Crime Inc.,\nBozo speaking.
