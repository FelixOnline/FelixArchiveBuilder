    "content": "Page 2 Felix, August 22,1980\nSir\nI would like to be the first to\ncomplain about your first attempt at\nproducing a PHALLI X. Eventhough I haven't seen any of it yet,\nI'm sure it will be packed with the\nsame wealth of degrading material which formed one of your previous\npublications( you know, that one).\nBesides inflicting your own insidious\nramblings on an innocent post grad community you will, no doubt, be\nincluding letters* full of useless rubbish, like this one. I think it's pitiful. We all know that fees are too\nhigh, grants are too low, Liberal Club shouldn't be allowed to do what they do and Just in Newland doesn't even exist! We're not interested in eternal crossfire from opposing camps concerning mainly moral meandering. Let's have letters\nfrom people who want to contribute a bit of news you may have missed;\nnews of past members of IC for instance or tips on upcoming events\noutside College. I also think this is a lousy way of getting me to fill your letters page.\nYours in anticipation of an editorial comment, Mark Smith (if in full)\nG.M. Tarkin (if letter is cut)\nDear Sweetie,\nTo my horror, I have recently\ndiscovered that most of my present\nincome is being' nicked' by my bank under the guise of' bank charges'. Whilst I see the point of' ripping o iF the 'filthy rich', I see\nthis as a gross injustice.\nI mean, how can a poor graduate, unemployed, possibly keep up with it! It appears tome that the students, with their grossly enlarged grants, should keep people like myself free from the clutches of the\nnasty banks.\nIt occurred to me that writing my cheques on fish might reduce my bill, but, regarding the price of cod at the moment, this notion was immediately struck from my mind. I urge you to persuade Tom Cot tre li et al to give us poor buggers\na chance. Yours, less than pleased\nSimon Middleboe\nIam not one to write reams of meaningless drivel just to get my name in FELIX but, this time I feel\nI really must make an exception\nand put pen to paper. Seriously, in all my time at ICI have never been\nso shocked, nor so annoyed by what\nis going on. I thought that there must be some\nintegrity left in the students of today\nbut apparently there is not so much as one grain of common sense or decency in anyone of them. It is a far cry from my first days\nat university when students were\nlooked upon as responsible, upstanding citizens who, if at times a little boisterous, were atleast, genuinely trustworthy people.\nNot so today! It was only recently\nthat the true depravity to which students a tIC have fallen was brought home to mein a fashion\nwhich left me speechless with disgust. Therefore Iam impelled to\nwrite this letter in the hope that\nperhaps some of your readers will\npull their socks up. Yours sincerely,\nC. Alucard\nReal name and address supplied.\nSir,I must say that I wholeheartedly commiserate with you on the matter\nof copy deadlines. Two months seems a perfectly adequate amount of time to write any article \u2014 I don't think you' ve ever given me more than two days to write anything. However, you already know this. I write this more as a pleading letter\nto those people out there who have\nmaterial for FELIX. Please get it in on time; there is nothing in the world more irritating than trying to\ndo a quiet evenings work in the office pasting up the Rag Mag whilst a rampaging FELIX Editor is\nstalking back and forth in a foul\nmood, screaming coarse invective\nat anyone in his way and shouting down curses on people who haven't delivered copy. Instead of getting on with it I find myself forced ( if I ever want to get any work done al all) to write letters like this to fill in the holes that you people leave. Honestly, he really is mean. Please\nhelp me. Yours sincerely,\nDave Jago\nDear Stephen, I hear you are staying on at that\nnice Imperial school for another year. I'm afraid your father is a bit\nupset as he feels you should be out earning a living, but then his boil\nmay need lancing. Besides you always were such an insular child and another year of quiet security\ncould mature you so much. What' s this about you growing some bread?\nI'm afraid your last letter was quite\neligible and I couldn't understand a word of it.\nI hope your cat gets better.\nYour loving mother,\nr PG Tips\nj Well, here it is, the first highly exciting \" PG Tips\" column of the\nnew regime, packed lull of exciting facts and useful hints towards\nleading a full and active life.\nFirst though, the committee:\nChair thingy: me (John Whitehouse), Chem4162 Secretary: John Haber shon, DSE S4272 Social Sec: Doug Armstrong, Chem4147 Treasurer: Graham Greene, Chem4117 Welfare Officer: Marcus Karo lewski, Che mEng3774 This year I intend to continue the scheme, started last year,\nencouraging departmental groups to set up and get busy organising\nevents, both with their own departments and on a wider scale, as in\ninter-departmental football matches \u2014 the carrot being the offer of cash or equipment.\nLast year there was a minor hassle, as an open oiler was made to\nall departments and we had no idea what was happening until the\nbills arrived, some of which had to be settled out of this year's cash,\nwhich sent Graham into a right tizzy. This year then, tell us\nwhat you intend doing first and things should run a lot more smoothly. The best way to get your share is to coop t some member of your department as a rep and send them along to our meetings.\nAlso if np one comes up with any exciting ideas, we'll be stuck with\nthe usual forty-five bar nights and the odd plough mans. Another ambition of mine is to actually hold a quo rate general\nmeeting at least once during the year.\nMy job is essentially representing you on Council and the Graduate Studies Committee. Now it's all right me ranting and raving about the inadequate and expensive refectory service over\nsummer, the fact that Stan's Bar prices are also up, the cricket\npitches at Hari in gt on were ripped up at the beginning of summer, PhD students average four and a half years to finish and are lucky if\nthey see their supervisors more than twice a year, but il no one\nother than myself has voiced any opinion on these matters, I'm not going to be able to fight with much conviction. Last year's questionnaire, for instance, received about 10% response, and most\nof them PhDs. It has been suggested that this year's reps should go\nround physically visiting as many as possible, would you reply then?\nAnother thing that bugs me is that PG Group receives only \u00a3 5 6 0\nfrom the Union, though admittedly, in the past they' ve had difficulty spending this much, but 30p return from the \u00a3 3 9 you're\nputting in doesn't strike me as very generous. Of course a lew PG s do take advantage of the full range of Union facilities, especially\nsports, but do you think you're getting a fair share? Please let me\nknow.\nJohn Whitehouse\nPG Chairman,1980/1 of property and open land is made to the students; there are massive\nareas of grass, that we, especially, miss\nout on by living in London \u2014\nthis makes Cambridge an attractive\ncity to be in during summers when the sun shines regularly. At teatime the cautious drinkers\nceased their peregrinations and stopped by again at the Corn Exchange where the beer festival\nwas accommodated; the range of beers put on was modest but well\nbeyond the capacity of any normal person in a single day. Cheap who lse some foods \u2014 brown bread, cheese, pickles, pies and more \u2014\nwere also laid on in the same area.\nDuring the steady drive through the grey blue flatness of the East\nCountry twilight, the loneliness of the journey home was eased by the\ngentle sound of the voices of the back-seat choir. Graham Greene\nCambridge trip\n( A review for those who missed it)\nAt te no' clock on Friday the meteorological signs looked favour able and there were a number of students on the dust dry pavement who were reluctant to climb into\nthe coaches. The drive to Cambridge was a bit warm but passed fairly\nquickly and we arrived at noon.A few groups went straight across to\nthe beer festival and when they left\nto get some lunch developed blinding headaches, a consequence of the strength of the beer and the parching heat. Down on the river some students engaged in horse-play on hired punts; those who gripped the\nquant s too long slid off the end plat i brm into the welcoming cushion of the Cam. Walking around the city was hard and thirsty work but it was interesting\nto see just how generous a provision "

    "content": "Pa\u00a3e6 Felix, August 22.1980\nRecord\nBoys Don't Cry\n(Fiction Records)\nThis album is an imported compilation of early Cure. It features all\nthe pre \"17-seconds\" singles and\nthe smoother parts of \" Three Imaginary Boys\".\nIt opens with the anti-fashion\nsong 'Jumping Someone Else's Train', follows with 'Boys Don't Cry' the tragically underrated debut single (I 'll never understand\nwhy this song wasn'ta hit), then\nthe slightly uncomfortable 'Plastic\nPassion'. The rest of the first side\nis off \"Three Imaginary Boys\", and\nincludes '10.15 Saturday Night' and\n'Subway Song', the latter being an\namazing track in which a walking\nbass line, an echoing guitar and\nisolated harmonica wails combine\nto produce a superb atmosphere of\ntension.\nSide two features two tracks not\nfrom \"Three Imaginary Boys\", to\nwit 'Killing An Arab' and 'World\nWar'.\nThis makes an excellent introduction to the music of the Cure, a sort of edited highlights, and though it omits ' So What' my\nfavourite Cure song, all the other\nobvious tracks are featured.\nThe Return Of\nThe Durutti Column\n(Factory Records)\nI got hold of this album \" on the off\nchance\", and I 've totally fallen head\nover heels for it. The Du rut ti Column is basically Vini Reilly,\nguitarist, writer, recluse and classic\nailing artist stereotype. He has\nproduced an album of moody evocative instrumental pieces\nranging from the infectious bu bb lie ness of 'Jazz' to the wistful, somehow unsatisfying 'Requiem\nFor A Dead Father'. He plays without recourse to cheap tricks, or\nmassed batteries of effects, and the\nmusic gains from this, achieving an\nintimacy that puts most solo guitar\nwork to shame. Martin Hannet's production is clear and sympathetic\nand the bass and percussion fit easily\ninto the background.\nIt's the ideal album for playing\nwhile sitting ona balcony soaking\nup the sun, for going to sleep to,\nfor waking up to, or for holding a conversation over. I love it.\nLenny Bruce At\nCarnegie Hall\n(3 record set)\nThis is not a new release, but it's currently selling at Virgin for only\n\u00a33, making it the best buy of the\nmoment. It appears to be a straight\nend to end recording of his act.\nThe essence of Lenny Bruce comedy is in the timing; he slows,\nsets the background, spots his\ntarget and races suddenly in to the\npunchline. The laughter is not\ndispersed immediately, for he\nnearly always jumps straight back\nin building up a wall of comedy\n(sometimes reaching almost lunacy)\nbefore smashing the whole to with\nthe punchline and usually leaving\nyou thinking at the end. The subject matter leaps from place to\nplace: racism, sex, a heckler, always sparked off from chance\nremarks.\nOne of the most interesting\nfeatures of the album is the way\nBruce deals with hecklers by\nsetting them up as a target for the\nlaughter of the rest of the audience.\nThis almost ruthlessness being a marked opposite to his normal selfless philosophy. The album\ngives at least a hint of the enigmas\ninvolved in the life of this remarkable\ncomedian. In add it on to which it's a damn good laugh.\nEric Jarvis\nAlthough in the States, so my\nAmerican friends tell me, books by\nEdward Gorey are just \"falling off\nthe shelves\", they tend to be\nextremely rare and hard to get\nhold of in this country. It's nice,\ntherefore, to find a Gorey double\nfeature easily available in most\nbookshops, at a reasonable price.\nThe only real way to find out\nwhat Gorey does is to find a copy\nof the book somewhere and flick\nthrough it, but perhaps a word or\ntwo of explanation might be useful.\nGorey draws in a very full, detailed\nway, giving his drawings a strong\n'Victorian' look. His subject matter\nmanages to attain the same kind of\nperiod flavour. Dancing Cats is a series of drawings, as the title page\nsays: \"in which cats are shown\nengaged, for reasons known only\nto themselves, in a wide variety of\nunlikely pursuits, many of them\nbeing of a rather mysterious\nnature.\" That just about sums it\nup. The pictures are quite sweet,\nwhich is rather unusual for Gorey;\nhis stories are usually either bleak\nand tragic or display a really evil\nsense of humour.\nThe second collection, Neglected\nMurderesses, is more typically\nGoreyesque, and consists of a series of drawings with a caption to\neach. Typical is: \"Nurse J. Rosebeetle tilted her employer out of a wheelchair and over a cliff at\nSludgemouth in 1898.\" The accompanying illustration shows the\nnurse standing at the top of the\ncliff with an empty wheelchair.\nBoth sequences in the book are\nworth looking at, although Neglected\nMurderesses appeal more to my\nmacabre sense of humour (some of\nthem will be in this year's Rag\nMag, so watch out!). The book\nmakes a nice addition to any\ncollection, being the sort of thing\nyou can keep for years without it\nlosing its appeal, and is worth \u00a31.50\nof anybody's money.\nDave Jago\nf Gordon Blurr\nPresents....

    "content": "Felix, Auyust 22,1980 Paf}e5 Reviews\nCinema\n\"ifs show time..?\nSince the last FELIX few worthwhile films have surfaced.\nClint Eastwood stars in the title\nrole of Bronco Billy, an unusual comedy in which Eastwood himself is as magnetic as ever. Billy is the\nmanager of a modern day wild-west\nshow who, through various misadventures, sticks to the upright morals of his cowboy heroes. The film is quite amusing and well played, although I doubt whether it\nwill appeal to many of you. Unrivalled in its appalling d rear i ness is the over hyped Can't Stop The\nMusic, starring the Village People and assorted idiots. The music is\nprobably catchy( but then again so\nwas bubonic plague), but outrageously bad acting is supported by amazingly unimaginative photography. Billing this with Kremmen\nThe Movie is a crime.' Nuf T said?\nI almost forgot Dynasty, the first 3-DRung Fu movie. Frankly fm not\nsurprised.\nOf a far more palatable nature is\nCaddyshack, a new golfing comedy. However, despite the good intentions\nand unusual subject matter, it falls\nwell below par. Breaking Glass The two most interesting releases to\nrecent weeks both opened yesterday\nand both concern music. Breaking Glass ( A A, Brian Gibson) is a British production starring Hazel O' Connor as Kate, a rising\nnew wave star who cannot cope with her eventual success. She is\nmanaged by Danny( Phil Daniels)\nwho, through his corrupt dealings\nwith the record industry, sparks off\nthe success of Kate and her band. The film defeats a fairly thin storyline with well-staged set-pieces\nand many light moments \u2014 watch out for Jonathan Pryce as Ken, a deaf sax player. Mis sO' Connor performs her musical histrionics with style, although her numbers lend themselves too easily to comparison with Len eLo vich. They are, nonetheless, very enjoyable, especially the interpretation of 'Eighth Day', her present single. Recommended. All That Jazz\nRoy Sch eider stars as Joe Gideon in All That Jazz ( X, Bob Fosse), a semi autobiographical film from musical director Bob Fosse.\nGideon, like Fosse is a successful\nBroadway director who, through smoking, speed, overwork and sex\neventually has a heart attack. The final months of his life are told in flashback by Gideon himself as he\nconfronts his final lady love \u2014\ndeath itself( portrayed hereby Jessica Lange as a showgirl in full\nbridal gown).S che ider gives a smooth portrayal of the cheating, loveable liar who is\nnever really certain what he really\nwants. His obsession with\" show time' runs to the very end; as he\nundergoes open heart surgery he directs his own death in a series of glamorous musical scenes. Particularly brilliant, in- my own opinion, was a fan dance around his own hospital bed to 'Who's Sorry Now?\\\nThe prospect of his death isn't just\nglanced at; he analyses his motives\nand looks at various aspects of his\nlife and loves.\nThe whole film centres on death, a subject which is obviously of questionable taste. I personally thought it was quite well handled and kept roughly to the tenuous\narea of' black comedy'. Fosse himself has survived a recent heart at tact and the film is\nO Hazel O 'Connor performs 'Eighth day'\nobviously full of his own experiences\nand opinions. The dance scenes are well shot( with some excellent editing) which adds to the credibility of the whole subject. Very enjoyable indeed. Brubaker Brubaker is an entertaining new film starring Robert Redford and the\never improving Yap he tK otto. It\nconcerns the efforts of a new prison governor( Redford) to reforma farm prison, based on the actual experiences of one Thomas Murton. He meets resistance at every quarter, especially from the' trustee' prisoners who starve and torture the\nother inmates for their own gain. Despite great personal risk, Brubaker sticks to his morals and eventually... Good heavens! What a cliff hanger. Anyway, it'san interesting,\nwell made film( if a little sombre) and well worth viewing. It opens on11 th September at the Leicester Square Theatre. Mark Smith\nTheatre\nAnarchy Rules, OK?\nAn anarchist, whilst being' interviewed' by the Italian police, falls to\nhis death from a seventh floor window. The court of inquiry finds\nthe death to be accidental. Two weeks later the government changes\nits mind and decides to set up a second investigation. All very jolly, you might think \u2014 and it is. This is\nthe background to one of the funniest plays currently in the WestEnd. The Accidental Death of an\nAnarchist, by Dari oF o( of We Can't Pay - We won't Pay! fame) manages to carry its message and remain superbly entertaining at the same\ntime.\nThe principal protagonist, played by Gavin Richards is an alleged\nlunatic, picked up by the police for\nvagrancy. Whilst in police head quarters, he hears of the impending arrival of the Judicial Investigator.\nBeing a master of disguise, he impersonates the judge and proceeds\nto question the two policemen responsible for the anarchist's death. He soon discovers that they were,\nin fact, to blame. Whilst pretending to be sympathetic he reduces them to hopeless confusion with his\" helpful\" suggestion. The plot thickens with the arrival of the ace\nreporter, ably played by Jen i Barnett. The endings( there are two!) nicely bring over the point of the play. The play is remarkable in that\nit neatly combines several types of humour. The jokes, for example, range from the appallingly obvious to the extremely subtle. In addition to the dialogue, which maintains a high standard of wit throughout, there are some excellent and be a uti fully timed visual jokes. The humour goes deeper, however, and the actual plot, and even the presentation\nof the play itself is very amusing. Gavin Richards does an excellent\njob both as actor and director. He keeps the play nicely balanced between farce and drama, and between comedy and political comment. Such a well rounded play should not go unseen.\nDave Jago\n\n"

The latter\nsix years were spent in the Organisational Methods Department. Due to economic cutbacks in the\nlast year the number of security guards have been reduced from 58\nto 48, i.e.24 per shift. However, Mr Reeves, whose son studied in Guilds seems ably qualified to make best\nuse of his available manpower. During the coming year, a roving patrol for the halls a sarape deterrent is likely to be formed and out of hours access to some College buildings will be more strictly controlled. A key card access method may be used for Huxley andR SM. RSC Drama\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company used the Great Hall recently to\nrehearse the present production of Henry IV. The dress rehearsal took\nplace between the 27th July and the\n5th August preceeding the RSC' s current tour.\nVan Trouble\nThe trials and tribulations of ICU Transport go on. Only weeks after\nbreaking down in Bristol and leaving the Cricket Club tour temporarily stranded, the blue van( G GP), on its way to Newcastle, got\nas far asK il burn before the alternator fell off. Fortunately the\nhire rs were able to use the new orange crew bus( RG O)f or the remainder of the journey. It was\nlater discovered that Peacock's of Balham had just replaced the alternator and since it was highly\nlikely that they had not bolted it\nback on properly they agreed to\nmake goodall the damage. Day Nursery\nThere is the possibility that ICU\nmay acquire some space in the\nRoyal College of Art Day Nursery\nfrom October for one year only.\nThe scheme will only work if we\ncan guarantee to fill the extra\nplaces and the RCA must know\nby Tuesday. The fees for the\nNursery are not yet fixed but will\nbe similar to or slightly less than\nthose charged in the IC Nursery.\nIf any student or member of\nstaff with children is interested\nplease contact J Passmore, ICU\nOffice (int 3915) as soon as\npossible.\nEven the new Transit( R GO) has\nnot been without trouble. When it\nwas only a month old, the suppliers,\nPeacocks again, fitted a new gear-box \u2014 as part of the first service! Railcard\nNext session, the British Rail Student Rail card will cost \u00a310 and is valid from 1st September,1980 to\n30th September,1981. It entitles\nthe holder to 50% off the following\nsecond class rail fares: ordinary single, ordinary return and away day return, limited only by a minimum student fare of \u00a32 Ordinary Single\nor Away day Return and \u00a3 \\ Ordinary Return. There is no minimum fare\non Saturdays, Sunday sandBank Holidays, any day during July and August or, for the first time this\nyear, after 1800 hours on Monday to Friday. Holders of Student Rail cards can also obtain half price travel on Sea link services to the Channel Islands and Ireland, and through rail/ ship journeys to the Isle of Wight.\" The Student Rail card's success is\nplainly due to the fact that it offers\ngreat value for money travel to young people who would not otherwise be able to travel so much\", said Mr. David Rayner, BR' s Passenger Sales Manager( Wow! -Ed). BR Student Rail cards may be\nobtained from the L ST Office near\nthe J CR when it reopens in late\nSeptember. Retirement\nMr. John Sam worth, the Bookshop Manager, has now retired after six\nyears as Manager. A party was held\nin his honour in the Bookshop on30 th July. MrS am worth, a keen\nartist, was presented with an easel\nfor him to enjoy during his retirement. We at FELIX wish him well and all the best for the future.\nThere will not be a new Manager in the Bookshop in the near future;\nit is hoped that it can run itself,\nwith the aid of a small computer. Share-a Fare\nWith fares rising once again I shall try once more to re susi tate the above scheme. Please send\ndetails of whether you want or\ncan offer a lift on a postcard to\nRoom 6M19 Huxley Building\nand when I have enough participants I will make a list and send\nout copies. I know people dislike\nbeing tied down, but if you can\nonly offer a lift two or three days\na week it all helps you and your\nenvironment! Don't forget to\ninclude an internal phone number\nor other contact point.\nJ Crawley, int 4595\nThe L instead extension is now complete after many, many months\nof building. At present the rooms\nare being broken in by hoard es of tourists, who, it is hoped, will take\nthe awful smell of polyurethane away with them on their clothes.\nThe extension can accommodate74 people;44 in double rooms. There are four floors labelled from\nA to D;A being the lowest floor,\nabove the beautiful view of the boiler house on ground level. Old L instead links with the extension\non levels A and D and will be the base\nfor all the amenities.\nThere* are no lifts, just stairs at each end. The system of the floors\nwith telephones on each level is similar\nto Weeks Hall; however, the ' new style angling of the windows, which is apparently intended to attract sunlight for a greater duration of the day, fails dismally. These peculiar window designs have resulted in producing some equally\npeculiar shaped rooms in which the resident has the choice of working in normal daylight near\nthe windows or relaxing in soothing\ndarkness in the back two-thirds of\nthe room; whether this is desirable is\nquestionable. A new feature of these\nrooms is the window box which should provide a pleasant facade for\nthe extension assuming everyone takes advantage of their window boxes. Unfortunately, in winter a facade of milk cartons, cheese packets and egg boxes might not\nlook so appealing. Maybe the hall\ncould organise a 'Best Window Box' competition to encourage this.\nHall Bursars!\nRecent weeks have seen some comings and goings amongst the housekeepers in the halls of residence.\nIsabel Hamilton, housekeeper of Garden and Weeks Halls, has left us\nfor fairer climes \u2014 she has moved to\na similar job at Chelsea College. The new housekeeper starts work\nthis Tuesday. Another new arrival, Debbie Ro well, has already started in L instead Hall. With the opening of\nthe new extension, it has been decided to provide the hall with its\nown housekeeper (to date L instead has been the responsibility of Gill Footer, who also has Selkirk and Ti zard to look after).\nFinally, congratulations to Gill Footer, who isn't anymore. As of several weeks ago, she is Mrs. Gill Th all on. In recent weeks a sizeable amount of structural damage has occurred in Garden Hall. Following the collapse of a ceiling on level 3 of the building, caused by a leaking sink unit, a large amount of heavy plaster was removed. The ceiling collapsed during a lunchtime and someone could have\nbeen seriously injured. A student\nwas in fact having a bath in the vicinity at the time and the cleaner had only just left.\nSubsequently further incidents have occurred. Flooding was caused\nin House10 of Garden Hall by an overflow from blocked showers\non Sunday,11 th August. On the\nsame day a cracked ceiling dripped water when a student had a shower\non level 4 in House11. Several ceilings seem to be in a questionable state of repair. Mr. Jeremy Turk, the Warden, has\nasked for all the ceilings to be\ninspected.\nFurther defects include the continued failure of the Entry phone System, which has been out of action for some time.\nSouthside Bar\nModifications to the bar beneath\nSouthside are presently in progress.\nImprovements include the intro-duct ion of new seating, heavy wooden topped tables and hessian\nwall coverings. Decorations will be\nadded to the walls and spot lighting will replace the present fluorescent\nlamps. By the use of partitions a series of small alcoves will be formed.\nThe estimated cost of the invest-ment is \u00a317,000 and the bar should\nbe open before the winter term.\nHot News\nInstallation of a new radiator system\nis nearing completion in K eoghan d Selkirk Halls. The work has taken\nthe whole of the summer vacation to\ndate, and has meant that the halls\nhave been unavailable for use in the\nSAC scheme. The new radiators are both more efficient and more attractive looking than the old, and it is expected that Falmouth and Ti zard will eventually follow suit.\nThe work is due for completion in\nthe first week of September.

Wolffe\nOur Ace Reporter who exposes\nwhere no other Ace Reporter\ndare expose\nContinued on page three\nAT the beginning of August it\nwas learnt that a hundred American tourists who had been previously booked with SAC( Summer Accommodation Centre) for a three-day period were now staying at the Penta Hotel in Cromwell Road. The official line is that \" such overbooking is quite normal and nothing to do with SAC incompetence due to them not realising that K eoghan d Selkirk Halls would not\nbe operational because of the replacement of radiators\". However, Captain Lindley had admitted to\nFELIX that this did not occur last\nyear ( Aha!). We refuse to believe\nthe official line of this matter and propose that the real reason (denied\nto the hilt by SAC) is due to the\nfilthy state of the RC$ windows. The RCS Office is next door to SAC and is believed to actually be\nthe SAC Office by some tourists from Third World countries.\nWe believe that the American vistors upon arrival at the SAC Office were so utterly disgusted at\nthe state of the RCS windows that\nthey as a party decided to*, take advantage of the Penta Hotel's competitive rates and much clearer windows. It is undisputed FACT that after\nmy initial telephone call to Captain Lindley conditions in the SAC Office took a turn for the worse.\nThreats\nThe SAC employees were advised: a) not to say a word about anything to anyone. b)if they did say a word to make sure they didn't mention 'that business'.\nc) if they did mention' that business' not to say it in the bar.d) if they did say it in the bar, not to say it if I was around. e) not to let anyone who did not work for SAC into the office.\nf) if they did let anyone in the\noffice to make sure it was not\nsomeone with a connection to\nFELIX. Breakfast Tickets\nOf even more interest is the fact\nthat Captain Lindley himself came over to the SAC Office and ordered a SENIOR RECEPTIONIST to immediately take bucket in hand and clean the RCS windows. Is this\na job for a person who is used to\nhandling millions of pounds worth of Mooney breakfast and lunch tickets\n(sometimes as many as 50!) to be\nexposed to? We at FELIX believe some pretty high level thinking went into this decision and realise that\nCollege would never submit a Senior Receptionist to such a menial task without good reason.\nIt is little wonder that the state of the RCS windows has caused such high level concern.

This historic silver trophy was well over\none hundred years old and was undoubtedly the most valuable item\ntaken. Other clubs hit hard by the\ntheft were Athletics and Golf. Many of the trophies belonged to\nthe University of London Union; indeed some should not even have been at IC. Earlier this year, UL U were informed that several of their\ntrophies being held by I Chad not\nbeen competed for in recent years\nand were offered their return. However, this produced no response\nand meant that the cups remained in the Union Office.\nback of the Union Building, opposite\nthe Albert Hall. It is apparent from the way the theft was carried out, that those responsible knew the layout of the Union Office and had a good idea of the security arrangements.. it should never\nhave occurred...\"\nAn unfortunate aspect of the loss\nis that it should never have occurred. At the start of the session, several\nUnion officers, worried about the\nAnother \"hot\" cup\nConversely, a large proportion of Imperial College silverware was in the Royal School of Mines at the\ntime of the theft. It had been borrowed by Mines Union for their\nAGM and Dinner, and, through a fortunate oversight, had not been\nreturned. Broken Window The theft took place in the early\nmorning of Tuesday,29 th July, between two o' clock, when Be it security made their patrol and the\ntime the cleaners opened the office.\nThe intruders made their entry by breaking a window in the Honorary Secretary'sON ice, which is at the\nrear of the building; they then farce d the rather inadequate locks\non the Trophy Cabinet. To carry away the sizeable haul, a small van or car must have been parked at the\nstandard of security in the Union Office and particularly the Trophy Cabinet, investigated means of\nimproving matters. The Deputy President, Malcolm Brain, wrote to\nthe College Estates Section on31 st October and3 rd December,1979, requesting an estimate for better locks, an alarm for the trophies and an extension of the rape alarm. Rachel S nee, this year's Deputy President received the reply on9 th July,1980 \u2014 addressed to Malcolm Brain. And the estimate was not\neven item is ed! Police investigations are being dealt with by Gerald Road Police Station, although no sign has been seen of them since the day of the\ntheft. Anyone with any information should contact either the Police, Mr Burroughs in the College Security Office or the Union Office. Your help would be appreciated. TopMan thwarts thief\nAt 4:00p.m. yesterday Mr. John Smith, the College Secretary\nand former Go verner of the Gilbert& Ellice Islands, arrested a thief in his office.\nThe Thief, whose name is uncertain at the time of going to press,\nwas described earlier as 'Malaysian-looking with dark hair' when he\nwas reported to College Security at 2:00p.m. as a suspicious\ncharacter.\nMr. Smith observed the thief leaving his office at 3:45p.m. His\nsuspicions aroused, he discovered that his wallet had been stolen.\nUpon challenging the thief he noticed his wallet sticking out of the\ngentleman's trousers\u2014a struggle ensued, a window was broken and\nthe thief overpowered.\nThe police arrived shortly afterwards but did not allow a full\nsearch of the thief in the College which means a delay in compiling\na full list of the other items stolen from Sherfield.\nLondon Student to fold ?\nLondon Student ( formerly Sennet) appears to be running into financial difficulties. Their usual printer, Baileys of Dursley, G los, has been dropped and a new printer sought. This looks likely to be Febedge's of Hack e ney \u2014 a test print run will take place at the end of August to see if the new printer can both cope with the hectic schedule inherent in printing a weekly newspaper and come up to the quality previously obtained by Baileys. With the change of printers comes a change in process; from letterpress to offset\nlitho. We at FELIX look forward to seeing the new look newspaper as we\nchanged from Bailey's letterpress to offset-litho on Union premises in1974. When it appears the newspaper will be slightly smaller than usual with a freshly designed header. (Incidentally, hope you like our new header - Ed.)\nHowever, a change of printers will not relieve London Student's financial\ndifficulties. Next year only22 issues with an eight page maximum will be\nproduced. Also, student unions have for the first time been asked to pay a subscription for the newspaper of21/2 pper copy. IC will be taking300 copies. Subscriptions at present stand at 6,700. About seven thousand subscriptions are needed at present to break even (in 1974, Sennet boasted\n100,000 circulation). If sufficient subscriptions or advertising revenue is not forthcoming, it seems likely that London Student will fold after Christmas thus\ngiving FELIX the largest circulation of any London student newspaper.\nA day at Buck House\nOn Thursday, 17th July, a few College notables were invited to\nattend a garden party to honour the Queen Mother, who is the\npatron of the University of London.\nThe mode of transport was the College motorised mascots to add\nauthenticity to the occasion. With Miss Jo Armitage dressed in pink\nhat and hastily made summer frock in Bo and Messrs Fox and\nO 'Boyle, dressed in Moss Bros morning attire, accompanied by the\nWheales in Jez, they set ofF in a light summer rain to the palace\nWith the passengers dropped ofi\" at the door, the transportation\ntook up their allotted positions in the Mall, ready to collect their\ncharges.\nThe participants, however, felt rather out of their depth, and, with\nthe exception of Miss Armitage, who engaged two old ladies in brief\ncon vers tion no-one did very much, though, I understand, Mr. O 'Boyle was very much on the look-out for any 'spare' aristocracy.\nA venture to see the Queen and assorted Royals was foiled by the\nhuge queues of people with the same purpose in mind and the\nambition to do something, in the Beatles mode, in the Royal loos\ndid not materialise.\nAs one can guess, the party, if that's what it was, dragged on a bit, and all were quite ready to leave at the appointed time; I think\nthe weather had a hand in this, though.\nThe motors were summoned over the loudspeaker system, \"the\ncar for Miss Jo Armitage\", etc, from the Mall and the 'party goers'\nwere duly picked up. Alas, Jez was not allowed to pass through the\nInner Gates by a Palace Official, so her charges had to walk.\nIt is understood from the few participants that I spoke to that the\nbest piece of the afternoon was coming and going, with the hawks\ntrying to guess who these strangely attired people, with as many as\nthree chau ff ers each, were. A good time was had by all!\nSimon Middleboe\n\n"

You will certainly find this issue full of news as it is the first one for\ntwo months and is somewhat of a review of those months for\nthose of you that don't keep your ear to the ground. This is my first and last PG issue due to the fact that the ownership\nof the Print Unit has just been transferred to the\nUnion from the College, and we were forced to buy our own materials. As College generally pay through the nose for most\nthings, this necessitated the search for ne w suppliers. This took\nfour weeks negotiation, together with viewing numerous folding\nmachines (we now have a Faltex folder, an absolute masterpiece\nof engineering!)\nYou will see that I have introduced one or two new features; I have launched 'Fishy Tales & Tasty Morsels' \u2014 an article which\ngathers together little snippets of news, gossip, together with a little\nsubjective cynicism has been lacking for some time.\nSAC\nThe less said the better. Captain Lindley (Domestic Secretary) and\nthe people who work in the SAC office are making complete and\nutter do ngos of themselves by the way they are overreacting to\nour perfectly straightforward investigation of rumoured malpractice\nwithin SAC( we have printed only fact, no rumours). The sooner\nLindley and SAC stop acting as if they were the cast of a disaster\nmovie, the sooner this whole ridiculous affair will be sorted out.\nI must apologise to any PG' s who are mystified by our lead\nstory \u2014 why don't you phone up Captain Lindley (int. 2216) and ask him what it's all about.

I attempted to probe deeper until\nthat magic phrase: \" No comment\" left afoul after vibration in my cochlea. I posed as an applicant for\nthe post of a Southside cleaner in the hope of gaining entry to the\nshroud of mysterious silence that had engulfed the SAC Office. Unt br tuna tel y,I was recognised and hence was unable to glean any information concerning the RCS windows; however, as I turned to\nleave, a sharp strong reflection of the sun penetrated my retina \u2014 my\noh my, how clean the RCS windows\nlooked! Immediately I sensed a cleanup operation had been in progress\nsince my initial telephone call to\nCaptain Lindley. One of the SAC employees later told mein the bar:\" For Christ' s sake, how can I tell\nyou anything while Iam still working there.\" S/he wished to remain anonymous for obvious\nreasons but did intimate that s/he would be revealing the full story\nafter his/ her term of employment had ended.( Watch this space!)\nIT is quite clear that a great deal\nof unnecessary pressure has been brought to bear on these tormented souls in SAC' from above'.

The swimming pool was closed for a longer period than usual due to the expected delivery of chlorine not arriving. During the time the swimming pool was closed for this reason, the Multi gym remained open although some people found it difficult to\npersuade the attendant to allow them in to use it. Hopefully, the\nsquash courts will be back in use\nshortly after the Sports Centre reopens in September. New Games Hall\nThe preparation of the new Games Hall in the old Chemistry Block is\nprogressing well and it will certainly\nbe ready for use by the start of term. Nick Morton( ACC Chairman) is currently looking for the most suitable equipment for the hall. Anybody with suggestions or complaints about sports facilities at College should contact Nick via the\nUnion Office.\nYacht Sale\nAt the end of january, many mon lhs ago, an ACC General Meeting decided to sell the Union yacht, Impetus. The main reason\nwas that due to faults in the construction of the boat; it had been\na constant drain on Union finances\nand consequently had been of little\nuse to Yacht Club members. The boat, bought in 1977, has\nsuffered from severe problems, arising from faults in the manufacture of the hull. This has meant that\nexpensive work needs to be done to\nmake Impetus safe and seaworthy.\nThe problem arises over who is\nresponsible for the cost of repair;\nMichael Arthur is at the moment negotiating with Coral Marine, the\nsuppliers of the yacht, their solicitors,\nand the insurers, but until the matter is finally settled, the yacht\ncan not be sold.\nThis means that while the yacht\nis un useable, awaiting sale, the Union is still spending large sums' on essential maintenance, insurance\nand mooring fees. However, members of the Yacht Club are now able to\nenjoy their sailing once more; the\nClub now charters yachts for weekends and during the vacations.\nThis has proved a far more suitable\narrangement. ByB.B. Wolffe\nB wt qU tt ke qo it Two weeks ago, a mews resident\napproached a Southside security guard to complain about the noise\nof knives and forks from the Southside\nMain Refectory and asked him to\nclose the windows. As it was an extremely hot day, he refused, whereupon the mews resident attempted to close them himself. When asked to leave by the security\nguard he resisted and became violent and thus ended up with a punch in the gob, your honour. A pom w Urn c^Lc e All praise for those chap pies in Estates. Within36 hours of the Union Office being broken into they\nwere around to fix the window in\nLiz Lindsay' s office, despite the twenty\nyear wailing list. However, they did omit to bring any tools with the m.(I knew it was too good to last - Ed).\nLater the same day they returned and as far as we can discern they\nmust be very keen to fix windows. In fact, they like fixing windows so\nmuch, that they smashed one that\nwasn't broken just so that they could have twice as much fun. The Summer Accommodation Centre( SAC) offers bed and breakfast\nto tourists for j \u00a39.40 a night. Of this,\nMr. Mooney apparently provides\n\u00a3 2 . 5 5 worth of breakfast per tourist per day. Initially, one would think that\nMr. Mooney could not possibly have the audacity to Offer tourists\nthe same \" food\" that he passes off\nas edible to poor unsuspecting students at these prices. Yet only last week a tourist complained of\nreceiving a mouldy chicken at lunchtime. It was immediately replaced \u2014 with another mouldy chicken! One of the first castings of the GPO' s new1980\" K\" pillar box was officially opened in Prince Consort Road near the Albert Hall stepson Thursday,31 st July. A group of thirty well-dressed\nladies and gentlemen were seen drinking and smoking cigars while\nviewing the postbox for about three\nhours. This is undoubtedly because\nthis revolutionary box is, to quote\nthe GPO:\"... smaller than its\npredecessor yet can hold just as\nmany letters. It has a new look collection plate \u2014 set at an angle\nand using easy-to-read lettering to\nhelp the customer \u2014 and incorporates\nfeatures giving greater security and safety\". The Post Office claims that\nthe old post boxes have to be replaced every twenty five years, and yet the old-style one across the\nroad has \" V.R.\" emblazoned upon it.\nThe advantage of the new boxes\nare that they are easier to make and the doors on the new boxes can be\nreplaced if damaged, whereas previously the entire box had to be\nchanged. The40,000 existing boxes\nwill only be replaced as needed, not\nimmediately \u2014 old boxes will remain in spots where it is \" en v iron mentally desirable\". It is interesting to note that only\nsix days after its official opening, the\nnew box had attracted its first piece\nof graffiti.\nAlt} Coleman' s Vamckm\nThe Oily Dow son memorial prize\nfor misleading headlines was today\npresented to Mr.S. J. Marshall. Act God? On Saturday morning,26 th July, lightening induced a large voltage\ninto IC Radio's cables in tunnels\nunder College. This destroyed most\nof the distribution and line receiving amplifiers which in turn destroyed\nthe power supply. It took a week to\ntrace all the damage and IC Radio is now back on the air23 times a week between6:00 \u2014 1 1 : 0 0 pm on Wednesdays, Fridays and Mondays if you' re lucky(?' Ed).\nCol ut Par WiTh e night of30 th June and morn mg1 st July marked the start of the new\nacademic year. A group of FELIX hacks celebrated the end of Colin Palmer' s debacle and the onset of new hope for the newspaper by engaging in a massive paper fight in\nthe FELIX Office in which60 reams of Mr. Palmer' sun distributed FELICE S were actually distributed, if only into the air. Following this, a photograph of Mr. Palmer was ritually burned with flaming issues;\nthis lead to a torchlight procession\naround the Quad at midnight. So as\nnot to waste the crumpled FELICE S which lay wounded in the office,\nthey were burned in the centre of the Quad( darkness prevented location of the barbeque area), thus\nsingeing Roderick Hill.3 i2d9 What a silly numbering system has\nbeen used for the new staircase telephone system in Southside! Rather than a simple two digit number to signify the staircase and level as for the rooms, (e.g.32 for\nstaircase 2 level 3), the company who installed the system were allowed to use sequential numbers( e.g.32 in the logical system becomes 19). This not only means that you cannot immediately deduce the correct number for the level and staircase you wish to contact, but also calls for the drafting of yet another telephone list which will\ninevitably be torn down by the residents.\nPerhaps all the room numbers could be changed to draw them into\nline with the wonderful new telephones \u2014 that's progress folks!\nAud cfa w&i While on level 32 Southside looking at the telephone, it was noticed that\nsomeone had dropped a real hum dinger. The fire bell above the fire\ndoor is conveniently positioned so\nthat when the fire door is opened it\nwill wedge beneath the fire bell. What if an actual fire should break out?\nWe could warn the residents of32 by phoning19 of course!\nJo it t tte iq ttt You may have noticed that the committee rooms on the fourth floor\nof the Union Building have now been labelled with gold lettering to\navoid confusion. To the discerning eye, however, the wording looks a little on the lows ide,as door lettering is usually at eye level. In fact, the artist, Steve Tyson(4 ft2 in) agrees with me but says it looks\nokay to him. lUo nail olE... It is pleasing to see that at last we\nhave got a Refectory Committee Chairman with a little sense. Dr. Bob Sch roter( a former Guilds' President) was observed eating at\nthe Royal College of Art on the\n14th of August along with the rest\nof IC.A quick phone call to the\nSouthside Main Refectory confirmed that it was, in fact, open.
