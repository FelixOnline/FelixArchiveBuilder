    "content": "SPORT\nCROSS COUNTRY\nThe club continues to make good progress in both University Leagues. After winning the first three matches, IC's1st team\nhave an 8 point lead over Barts and Kings\nin a700 pt total. The second team also\nleads the second division by about 80 pts.\nfrom Guy's and Goldsmith's with the 3rd and 4th teams in 7th and 8th places respectively in a field of 18 teams. A succession of\nregular matches shows a more disappointing\nform largely due to continuous weakening of\nthe club b v the University.\nThe annual two-man mile invitation Paarluuf was held at Hurlingham on Sunday 26th November. This race is over 40 laps divided into 220-440 yd laps, with each runner\non alternate stages. Apart from proving to\nbe an extremely interesting slant on racing\nGalling one's self?) it is extremely good train-ing. The race was won by Bogshaw of LSE/ Littlewod, Barts in 45-10, with John\nCollins/Dave Hammonds IC's first team\nhome in 3rd place in 45-50.\nTomorrow, Saturday 9th December^ the\nUniversity Championship takes place at\nWimbledon Common. After six successive\nwins, the first team have every hope of retaining the Tyrian Cup. However, a greatly\nimproving UC team could well upset hopes.\nThis race also incorporates the intercollegiate\ncross county competition, counting towards\nIC Sports Day. Why not come and support\nyour constituent College? Helpers would be\nvery welcome to act as recorders and team\nmanagers for the six IC teams; see the Cross\nCountry notice board for details.\nDOUBLE TRIUMPH FOR SWIMMING CLUB\nTwice within a week, the College flag has\nbeen flown in honour of the Swimming Club\nfor winning both the UL Water Polo KO Competition, and the UL Men's Challenge\nCup for swimming.\nAn uncertain start against QM C nearly put\nIC out of the running but by playing more\nas a team they reached the semi-finals only\nto find their opponents were the old lags of\nthe IC II team. IC played in the spirit of\nthe competition, unlike Barts, who in a similar position withdrew one of their teams, and\ntreated the spectators to the fine sight of\nthe second team revelling in their only opportunity to hammer our firsts.\nLuckily, the first team won and in the fin-al, a shocked NCL team (certain f ovo u rites, or so they thought) were soon 2 goals down.\nPutting on the pressure in the second half\nthey soon drew level but a series of indiscriminate fouls against our players gave us\na well deserved 5-4 victory. Harford, Morris\nand Ted were outstanding in this match.\nThe first night of the UL Championships\nsaw IC to the fore once again, with Cliff\nDavis setting up a nAv fly record whilst the\nfree style relay team comfortably bettered\nRUGBY\nThe first hurdle of the University Cup was\nsurmounted when IC beat NCL comfortably\nby 14 to 3. There seems no doubt that a strong IC cup team has an excellent chance\nof retaining the cup, but the usual team\nweakened by injuries and UL U demands\nhave been struggling after a good start to\nthe season (5W,8 L, ID), but with the exception of the cup match, the last win was Oct.\n28th. There are some easier fixtures ahead\nand the in j pry list is being reduced so the\nrecord should improve.\nThe main reserve teams have suffered by\nthe calls of the first XV with the result that\nthe Ex. 1st and A XV's, and Ex. A XV have\nonly one win apiece, but a real improvement seems to be on the way. It would have\nhelped these teams if they could have fielded\na full 15, but this has not always been pos-sib le,a situation which should not arise in\na club of this size.\nThe B and Ex. BX V's do not suffer so\nmuch from this difficulty as their strong team\nspirit enables them to field regular teams.\nMany players i who could play for i higher teams have decided to stay with the lower\nteams, so that their records are the best in\nthe club, the Bl st's having lost one match,\nJim's two, the B3 none of seven games, and\nthe B4 and 5 not being so successful. The\nstars of the club are without doubt the B3, having scored 50 points on two occasions,\ntheir total is 212 for and 89 against in only\n7 games.\nSAILING\nLast Friday I.C. entertained the University of London Sailing Club at Ayrton Hall\nfor the Annual Ball\nDuring the course of the evening, the var-o us trophies we fce presented, I.C. winning\neverything bar the 2nd place in the ' A' points. The President, who had been invited,\nwas suitably appreciative. I.C. are continuing to do well this year and we hope to repeat the performance.\nA new boat will be arriving after Christmas. This brings the total to six, the largest number owned by any one college in the\nUniversity. This will provide further opportunities for people wishing to sail.\nthe existing record. The finals resulted in a long series of second and third placings with\nfew wins and IC topped the overall point\nscore with 48 points to NCL's44, and Kines'\n35.\nThe display of swimming and water polo\nstrength augers well for the Intercollegiate\nGala to be held tonight at UL U pool at 6.30\np.m. Turn up to see the same first class performances in the pool, and help in the celebrations after!\nB.M. SOCCER\nHoping to win the University Soccer Cup\nfor the fourth season in succession, the 1st Round game on Sat. 25th Nov. at Harlington, against Woolwich Poly, was approached\nfar too casually and after a very tough 90\nminutes the score stood. 0-0. A drawn game\nseemed imminent as in the 90 minutes the\nI.C. defence had blotted out Woolwich's forward line, whilst the forwards moved slowly\nlacked directness and many good scoring\nchances were wasted.\nIn the second period of extra time Mike\nCox scored two goals from close range, having evaded the strong Woolwich defence that\nhad played extremely well for the previous\n100 minutes.\nIn defence it must be pointed out that I.C. finished with 10 men on the field, Colin Harris having been carried off on a stretcher just\nafter half time while three of those were lim-ping: Steve Fisher having gone on to the\nwing after two minutes of the start of che\ngame and Lawrie Austin and Max Finney\nhaving injured ankles in the second half.\nIn the 2nd teams cup, I.C. II and III had\nnarrow victories,which were in keeping with\ntheir excellent performances this season.\nThe 4th XI are still without a win, although they were by no means disgraced in\nlosing 3-0 to U.C. II in the cup. The Ex.\n7th s strengthened by formed Soccer Club\nstars march on and are now unbeaten since\nthe first game of the season.\nCurrently the 1st and 3rd XI are leading\ntheir respective/ leagues jn the University\ncompetition, and there is promise of an even\nbetter season than last.\nTEAM RECORDS up to and including Saturday, Dec. 2ndP.

    "content": "- 2\n50 ANNIVERSARY\nof the Union\nBY OUR CONVIVIALITIES CORRESPONDENT\nI had a slight headache in my left eye\non December 3rd. This was probably due to\nDecember 2nd, when the Union celebrated\nit 50th anniversary. A large crowd of past\nand present Union celebrities, officials and\ngeneral lay about s, with an admixture of academic and administrative staff were\ngathered together at a reception in the Upper\nDinning Hall and the Senior Common room\nwhere the drink flowed freely and the conversation was, to say the least, lively.\nA happy note was struck right at the beginning by the appearance of a rum punch,\nthe very smell of which brought tears to the\neyes of one former Union official. This was\nan incredible drink which conferred the gift\nof to u gue s on more than ex-I'.C. rugby\nplayer. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. But\nwell begun is half done, as they say, and\nthe festivities took on a more than Olympian look. At this point my recollections of\nthe evening become a little blurred, but the\nthing which stood out more than anything\nelse was that all the older people present\nreally enjoyed themselves.\n...Our correspondent blissfully expired at\nthis point, so we can on lv add that, judging\nfrom the chaotic state of the Lower Lounge\nand the New Hostel, a good time was had\nby one and all (or words to that effect!!).\nPROFESSOR\nFRED HOYLE\nA TI.C. Approximately 650 people attended the\nmeeting of the R.C.S. Maths. & Phys. Society\non Nov. 21st to hear Professor Fred Hoyle\ngive a very comprehensive and interesting lecture on the origin of the solar system. Professor Hoyle began by giving a survey of\nthe theories from Laplace to Lyttleton and\ncontinued with his own supernova theory\nwhich he had later abandoned in favour of\na condensing gals cloud and its associated\nmagnetic fields. His lecture ended with the\nprediction that there was no heavy water on\nJupiter \u2014 any keen P.G. want a research\ntopic?\nThe organising committee of the society\nshould be congratulated on arranging three\nexcellent lectures this term, their efforts have\nbeen well worth while.\nJ.K J. FELIX YET ANOTHER1 SURVEY 1\nAt lunchtime on Thursday Nov. 22nd Mrs\nRobb was to be seen in the Union Archway\nprocuring innocent young men for yet another student survey. The pill was sugared\nby the presence of an attractive red-headed\nyoung lady who was distributing the quest-ion aires. This was a pilot survey for a nat-ion-wide one to be organised in the Spring\nfor the Robbins Committee, and comments\nwere invited on the questions and any other\nmatter relevant to the survey. No doubt due\nto the red-head's presence the comments received were milder than might have been\nthe case.\nCorrect Procedure\nJust to emphasise the point let us first outline the incorrect procedure. Find a telephone\nthat works and dial the number that ,you\nfound in the booklet on DSIR grants. This\nloses your four pence right away, because you\nmerely get the Whitehall exchange operator\nto tell you that the number has been changed.\nAssuming that you can remember the new\nnumber that you are told, you dial it and\nafter a few attempts you find that the\nphone has an objection to that particular\nnumber and keeps on burping back at you.\nUndaunted you get the operator and she finally gets you through to the DSIR incoming\nswitchboard. This is where your troubles really start.\nThe DSIR operator knows nothing about\ngrants or anything, and passes the call on to\nan infinite series of people who are in a similar position. Halfway through this lot,\njust as you have got your piece down to the\nabsolute mini mun j number of words, you are\ncut off and find yourself addressing the Chancery operator again). She sym pathis es and\nputs you back to the DSIR switchboard and\nyou are off on the infinite series again. This\ncan happen several times and can mean i>p to half-an-hour in the phone-booth before,\npurely by chance, you contact someone who\nknows something about DSIR grants.\nIn contrast, the Finney-Gilbert procedure,\nnamed after the two intrepid idiots who discovered it, is beautifully simple. Dial CHA\n1262 and ask immediately, without revealing\nyour mission, for extension 237. This puts\nyou in touch with the only man who knows\nanything, and is strongly recommended.\nI.C. out of U.L. U. On Thursday, November 23rd the IC Debating team was knocked out of the UL U competition by a team from Richmond Training\nCollege. The motion was \"That the monarchy\nis irrelevant\" and Richmond were prop os ing. This motion was eminently suitable for\na debating competition and neither side could\nproduce an overwhelming argument. Nevertheless, I.C.'s team, Finlay McPherson, Dick\nLewis, Asit Chandmal and Bob Finch acquitted themselves well and their opponents\nsuperiority was only marginal. By far the\nbest feature of the debate was Taff Philips'\nchairmanship; although engaged at very short\nnotice Taff made an excellent job of the serious side and during the free-for-all while\nthe judges were in session he was the life\nand soul of the party. The U.L. U. judge disgraced himself by turning up an hour late\nand prattling in the worst possible style for\nfar too long before announcing the result.\nThe Saga\nof the Yogi Bear\nOn Friday Dec. 1th,2 nd Year Chem* Eng.\nterror is ed the Snack Bar by removing the\ntrousers of catch able members of Zoology,\nthe present owners of Yogi Bear, Chem. Eng.\n2's favourite tele vf ki on chara cher. To raise\nfunds for the stolen Mr. Bear, the unfortunate zoologists were charged 2/6 each for the\nreturn of their trousers; there was no discount\nfor repeated orders and one gentleman paid\n7/6 for three pairs.\n1\nQUOTES OF THE WEEK '\nI am not aC.

The first team nas\nentertained several teams at home this sea-son. We put up a good performance against\nBerks, and Bucks. County Team of 8 and\nespecially so in the second half. IC finally\ndrew after pulling up a deficit of 20 imps\nat half time.\nFor the second year in succession we were\ndrawn against Harrison Gray's team in the\nLondon Championship Team of 4. They\nfielded their strongest team consisting of M. Harrison Gray, A. Rose, R. and J. Sharpies\n(all Life Masters) and F. North and J. Pugh\n(both National Masters). Needless to say we\nexpected to be rather outclassed but this\ndid not prove to be the case.\nAfter 8 boards there was no swing and\nafter 16 boards we were only one new imp\ndown. On board 13th we had a very unlucky\nswing.\nWest Dealt. Love all.\n9 -BADMINTON\nA. J.9.8.5.4. K.9.7.5.3.2.K.A. Q. J.9.6.5. Q.102.A. Q.8.4. K.10.8.7.4.3K.6. J.10. A.10 i3.2.7.3.Q.8.6.4. J.9.7.65.2.

As this\nwas right we lost 11 imps on the board, our\nother pair playing in only 5s. This represented a swing of 22 imps on the board and\nour chance of a sizeable lead at half-time\nhad gone. The second half was fought out\nkeenly but we finally lost by 17 new imps.\nThe performance of IC in these matches\nhas undoubtedly raised the prestige of the\nCollege in bridge circles.\nBoth the first and second teams have won\ntheir rounds in the Hospitals a and College\nCup and it is quite possible that the final\nwill be a repeats of last year's clash. IC is\nalso supplying by far the bulk of the University team at present.\nWe have held three pairs contests, so far,\nand it is hoped to hold another befor Xmas\nvacation. All have been well supported and\nall members are welcome to play. Guests are\ninvited.\nSince our last report the mixed team has\nchalked up three consecutive 9-0 wins, over\nLondon Hosp., L.S.E., and Q.M. C. The\nladies team sup rise d us all by beating Royal\nHolloway 7-2.\nThe men's team have also been going a good account of themselves. The 2nd team,\nafter losing 6-3 to L.SE.1 and Q.M. C.1, beat Chelsea 1 by the same score. The l st team beat Battersea 6-3 on a highly mobile\nplaying surface! The match was noted for the\nfine play in the game between the Battersea first pair and I.C.'s Pete Semple and Sarfrez Ahmed. Fresher Pete Semple is proving\nto be a valuable asset to the club. Last week\nthe l st team beat an uninspired L.S.E. team\n9-0, to remain undefeated so far this season.\n-R.C.S. CARNIVAL CAB ARE TThis was one of the best Cabarets of recent years, with the possible exception of\nlast year's R.C.S. effort. The production was\nsomewhat varied; at best quite hilarious, at\nworst entertaining, and it succeeded in keeping the cong rag ation with the cast throughout.\nThe producer appears to have been Dick\nFoster, or Jon Bareford, or some combination of the two, occasionally hindered by\nD. Lain, and assisted backstage by Norman\nFranklin and an unnamed Guilds' electrician.\nTheir Neolithic Nights was a fine attempt at\nthis most difficult type of production.\nOf the various items in the Cabaret, undoubtedly the most effective were the Queer\nSong and the neat Bus Stop sketch \u2014 al-though, musically, the opening 'Great One'\n(who was he?) and the 'Rock Song' were\nalso good. Dick Foster is to be congratulated\non a startling appearance as two different\nvehicles, and 'Angela' made a delightful Miss\nConception \u2014 not, perhaps so revealing a role as last year's, though!

Well, do not worry if this week you\ncannot understand a word \u2014 is not your\nfault it's mine. What a week-end! What a shambles! Let's forget about running rugby\nteams, C.'sN. D.,S.C. C.,R.C.

But if I go back a little way further 1\nhave vague recollections of starting the evening by consuming 2\\ pints in the Queen's in twenty minutes, followed by three rapid\npints in the I.C. bar and then playing darts\nof all things. I remember being quite excited\nover this, at least someone was excited and\nI think it was me. But to go back even further there were those crazy biochemists in\nthe basement who try to make wine out of\nevery enzyme that they cannot in det if y. How\nmany bottles of that so called apple wine\ndid we drink He said he had a dozen bottles\nsomewhere, but we can't have drunk that\nmany, the fridge was not big enough, and\nafter all there^were only three of us, or was\nit four? Oh, yes, that funny fellow with no\nhair on and a big beard, you know the one\n\u2014 he ordered another rum-punch to be made\non Saturday and then discovered it costs \u00a318,\ncame along and said something about wanting a sack for the Carnival. Seem to remember stuffing him in a green sack and then\nnearly cutting his ears off when trying to\ngive him arm holes. Oh, yes, the Carnival.\nDon't remember fee ing him there 'though,\nin that sack. What was that about his head\nbeing dirty? Surely we did stick him in the\nsterilisation cupboard? I had better go to have\na look. Oh, no, of course, he was there on\nCITY AND GUILDS COLLEGE\nENTERTAINMENTS COMMITTEE\nENGINEERS\nDINNER DANCE\nJanuary 26th1962 Apply now for tickets.\nForty-four shillings double.\nSaturday. The Carnval cabaret seemed good,\nbit obsessed though, these mixed up Guildsmen trying to wreck it, McPherson going to\nstop them, wonder if they filled him in-That's it, these films, I knew something was\nbothering me. I was watching Peter Sellars\nin some crazy good picture and I closed my\neyes for a second and instead of being an\ninspector from Scotland Yard he was a dig\nchief Union official. Still don't understand\nthat, and those floppy nude women what had\nthey to do with a theft from a museum? Bit\noff that I thought.\nWhat happened on Saturday? Somebody\nwas. three men short, good game though. I went to Harlington to play soccer for Ben's team, didn't see Ben though, don't remember seeing Ben after 12.00 midnight, funny\nthat, anyway I was changed for soccer wher\nsomebody said the extra A needed a wing\nforward. Seem to remember playing wing\nforward for the first XV some time ago-Wonder if I did play rugby.\nNever seen anything like it. Started off soberly enough, everybody on sherries then\nrum-punch, then beer, then there was some\nmore rum-punch, then beer, then there did\nnot seem to be anything left but sherry. Had\nto buy the drinks in the I. CW. A. Lounge.\nSaw Ben again didn't look too good. Don't remember much until Dr. McCoubrey ar-rive d. Seem to recollect going to McPherson's room for coffee never been in a sea of\ngreen crepe paper before. Must have been\nother people there occasionally saw hands\nwith arms attached poking through the paper.\nWas it McPherson's room though? Who made\nthe c of fy anyway? Wonder why Lyle and\nStacey kept coming in off the balcony through\nto the sea and out through the door. Wonder\nwhat day it is.\nTHEATRE TIGER AT THE GATES \"Tiger at the Gates\" is a trag i comedy set\nin the time of the Greco-Trojan Wars. In it\nthe Dramatic Society have again found a play which debarks the kitchen sink school.\nThe play has a message which is communicated without grime or vulgarity and sex is\npresent without being dominant.\nThe play presents the opinion that war is\ndependant not so much on the leaders as the\nstate of mind of the people. A parallel may\nbe drawn between the pointless death of a Trojan sailor brought about by the lies of\na dying poet-politician and the as s as i nation of an Archduke in 1914 b v mistaken nation-a lists. Neither were really important but\nserved at the excuse that had been awaited.\nThis play has not the depth of The Ascent\nof F6 possessed but never t ne less it is wort ny of reading prior to seeing. Mike Barron's production is carried along well by the comedy\nwh ch is personified for members of the Union\nby James Carter \u2014 I quote from the programme \u2014 playing the part of! a sex-starved\nTrojan. In general the production %is solid\nbut like the \"stone\" step has the occasional\ncreak. The standard of acting is again very\nhigh but as in F6 the female lead is the weak\npoint; however, Paris' portrayal of John\nWebb is inimitable!\nI have not mentioned the electricians, the\nmake up and many other small items: this\nis because they do their job with efficiency\nand without protrusion; in conclusion I would say that this was a play worthy of full\nhouses.\n\n"

For the\nsake of those who value these vitr tue s and\nfor Mr. Levitt's information, I beg of you\nto grant me the hospitality of a column of\nFelix.\nOn the basis of the most conservative\nUnited Nations es tim te, at least 600,000\nArabs fled from Palestine as a result of the\n1948 war. I don't think that one needs to be\nas knowledgeable in mathematics as Mr.\nLevitt is to conclude that more than a miracle is needed to make a nation's population increase six fold in the span of 12 years'.\nI would certainly ask him to check the source\nfrom which he obtained the figure of 100,000\ninhabitants in the whole of Palestine in 1936.\nThe best known estimate puts the figure\nnearer half a million (His Majesty's Government Report to the League of Nations).\nAs for the statement that 90 per cent of\npresent day Israel consists of swamps and\ndeserts which nobody inhabited, all that is\nneeded is for someone to take the trouble\nof looking up any geography book. It\nwould not be difficult to check that there are\nno extensive swamp areas in that part of the\nworld. As for the Negef which forms the main\ndesert area in Israel, it forms only 45 per\ncent of its total area. The Negef was, any-how, annexed by Israel since the signing of\nthe armistice in 1948, in a series of at tak s between 1949-1950 against repeated U.N. resolutions.\nm any case, the number of people living\nthere and what proportion of the land they\noccupied are irrelevant to the moral issues in-vol ved What is relevant is that these people\nlived there continuously for 20 centuries, so\nthey had a perfect right to regard the country\nas theirs. What is more they were a homogenous\nnation having a common language, religion and\nculture. Were they morally wrong in resisting\nJewish immigration when such em migrants arrive with the declared intention of creating an all-Jewish in de pe dent state within\ntheir country? Or is Mr. Levitt going to uphold the principle that any nation (religious\ngroup!) which has an emotional attachment\nto a particular piece of land is morally justified in acquiring it irrespective of what\npeople already living there might think?\nI am awaiting Mr. Levitt's promised article with great eagerness- Surprising as it may\nseem to him, I am as eager to establish the\nmorality of it all as anyone else. I hope he\nwill write it in the same spirit of good faith\npromotion Of peace and understanding and\nthe alleviation of human sufferings, which\nI wrote my article in.\nYours etc.,\nM.H. KUBBA\nDear Sir,\nPlease allow j ne to reply to Mr. Levitt's letter which you published in the last issue\nof Felix.\nIf Mr Levitt is not a Zionist (I say Zionist\nnot Jews, since all Jews are not Zionists) then\nhe is either biased against the Arabs or has\nbeen carried away by Jewish propaganda. I dm not concerned here about his references\nto such things as the barriers to Jewish immigration in Palestine, etc. What I would\nlike to point out is that before the Jews got\nthe idea of setting, up a state in Palestine\nthere was a minority of Jews living in'Pal-e stine just as in other Arab countries. This\nhad been the case for many centuries and\nwas not something quite recent. Now may I ask, what right had the Jews who were foreign to Palestine have in setting up Israel.\nIt was mainly because of the foreign Jews\nor Zionists that this agitation for Israel\nff tar ted. The majority of Jews in Palestine\nand the Arabs were living peacefully for centuries and would have continued to live like\nthis had there been no Zionists. Any person\nreading the many unbiased works on this subject will soon come to the conclusion that is\nis strange and shocking that the Zionists\nshould have done to the Arabs what the\nNazis had done to them.\nOnly when individuals stop believing in\nthings like \"My country, right or wrong\", or\n\"My community, right or wrong\" will there\nbe any justice and peace in the world.\nYours truly,\nAZIZ SULAIMAN, AERO 3\nSir,\nThere seems to be a regrettable tendency\nin the College towards a more Social Club\n\u2014 type attitude. You, Sir are as much to\nblame as anyone in not reporting the activities\nof the more important sporting clubs, and as\nrepresentatives of about 300 players we feel\nwe must protest very strongly over this neglect of the Soccer and Rugby Clubs'.\nYours,\nD.R. HARBURN\nCAPT. I.C.A. F.C. J.P. KEHOE\nCAPT. I.C. R.F.C. Dear Sir,\nThe correspondent who wrote the report on\nthe last Union Meeting seems to be under\na complete misapprehension about the use-fulness, or perhaps he would prefer to use the\nterm uselessness, of \"procedure\" at meetings.\nIn fact, good procedure sensibly upheld by\nthe Chairman is especially useful at meetings\nwhere a great deal of business has to be\ncompleted in a restricted time, as is the case .\nat our Union Meetings. The Chairman by\nproper application of pre ce dure should be\nable to keep the debate on strictly relevant\nterms thus enabling the business to be completed in a correspondingly shorter time. For\nexample, the motion to reinstate I.C.C. N.D. would have been put to the vote much earlier\nif the Chairman had been able to cut short\nthe rambling, and to a large extent irrelevant,\nspeeches made by the two gentlemen who opposed the motion.\nIt appears that the author of the article\nhas had misfortune to be present at meetings\nwhere irresponsible Constitutional and Procedural wrangles have taken place and I would\ntherefore like to suggest that he goes to a properly run meeting where he will see for\nhimself that all such meetings are not \"pro-ce dure bound slang ing matches.\"\nYours sincerely,\nC.M.B. HENDERSON\nP.G. GEOCHEMISTRY\nDear Sir,\nI have read the article in the last issue of\nFelix concerning an l.C. Motor Club.\nI believe that it would be rather pointless\nto form such a single club instead of having\nthe three seperate clubs. At present Guilds\nis the only really active Motor Club and its\nmeetings, film shows, rallies, visits and talks\nare open to all its members many of whom\nare from Mines and R.CS. I hope that they\ndo not mind being members of a Guilds\nMotor Club rather than an IC club. If they\ndid have active clubs, we would be only too\nglad to join them as it would enable us to\nindulge in even more motoring activities.\nIt is the responsibility of the club committee to maintain the three mascots in running\norder and I am sure that no single committee\nwould have the time to look after all three\nvehicles properly.\nI hope never to see the day when an I.C. Motor Club has to be formed because there\nis not enough support to h aave seperate\nclubs.\nYours sincerely,\nS.R. KLAT P.G. M.E. Captain, Guilds Motor Club\nDear Sir,\nAs possible originator of the idea of an\nI.C. motor club for the article in the last\nedition of Felix, I feel bound to comment.\nJudging from the present state of the constituent college motor clubs, an I.C. club\nwould be doing little more than changing the\nname of the Cuilds' club. Even the upkeep\nof the so-called 'motorized mascots' would\npresumably still have to be maintained by\nunwieldy sub-committees from each college.\nThere is much that can be said against\nchanging the name. The club has a proud\ntradition built up since its foundation in the\nlate 20V Its reputation stands high as having\nproduced some of the best rally men in the\nUniversity. A fine example set In recent years\nis that of Keith Duckworth (Captain five\nyears ago) who produces the Cosworth-Ford,\none of Briton's most successful racing car\nengines.\nInvested in the club name is a consider-able, sum in the form of car badges, which\nhave to be bought in bulk to prevent their\nprice being prohibitive. The financial aspect\nis perhaps the mo$t important one. Guilds\nM.C. receives nearly twice as much fin an vial support as R. CS. because of its larger\nmembership and it seems unlikely that I.C.S. C.C. would be willing to put up a three-figure sum each year.\nYours etc.\nH.C. WATSON\nP.S. When will Felix learn that BO is male'!\nDear Sir,\nIt is proposed to form an \"Anarchists' Society\". This society would co-ordinate the efforts of those students who are dissatisfied\nwith this country's progress towards a democratic Socialist republic, and who are prepared to use revolutionary means to achieve\nthis aim.\nAnyone who is interested should contact\nme through the Aero rack-S.

    "content": "FELIX\nIIII PIP II OF IMPERIAL COLLIDE OHIO* Edltmial Cammettt\nSeveral readers have remarked on the absence of editorial from the past few issues\nof Feli*. and some explanation ma v be we l come. The Editor belie vs that Felix's first\ni ob is to report news and that a regular so i el by the Editor himself is of secondary im-port ance: thus pressure on space has excluded editorial comment from some recent\nissues. This time however there are several\nthings that ought to be said.\nThe first is that many students at this College are ill-mannered, uncouth and given to\npetty thieving. Felix can vouch for this last\nbecause we often lose up to \u00a31 from our\nboxes and tins each fortnight. This is appalling but it is true. As for manners, we appreciate that students enter this College as\ncallow, unpolished youths, but this is no excuse for the uncouth inconsiderate behaviour that many outsiders take for our trade-mark. Also, whilst appreciating that this\nmay be a rare exception to the rule, we have\nhad reported to us-' the boorish behaviour\nof one professor of this College to a girl-student who had come to see him on a perfectly legitimate errand. This sort of thing\nis offensive and unnecessary; perhaps a little\nmore politeness on both sides might help staff-student relations.\nFelix itself has some apologies to make\nfor its behaviour. Due to the disorganised\nstate of Felix generally (part lv inevitable and\npartly due to the Editor's way of working)\nwe did not print some articles which we had\nasked for in the last issue. We apologise to\nthose concerned. Since it seems to be a touchy subject in some quarters we should\nalso apologise to the other Union publications (Phoenix, Exploration Review, Mountaineering Club Journal and Scrutiny) for\nmentioning them or not mentioning them 'is\nthe case may be. It is the Christmas issue\nafter all.\nThe Editor would like to thank all those\npeople who have assisted Felix in any way\nthis term, both his regular staff and the students who are interested enough to come along and help. These people have given generously of their time and energy and their\nwork is all too often taken for granted.\nFinally, a Merry Christmas and a Happy\nNew Year to all our readers.\nFELIX BOARD1961/62 Editor\nSecretary\nSales Manager\nAssistant Sales Manager\nSports Editor\nProduction Managter\nAdvertising Manager\nTreasurer and Buisness Manager\nPublications Board Representative\nPublicity Manager:\nDAVE GILBERT\nPENNY HOWARD\nMICHELE CONFAUVREUX\nCHRIS PETRI\nDENIS RAMHARRY\nANDREW PAWLOWICZ\nJAMES PORTER '-\u2022-\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab.\nTONY ALCOCK\nPETE YOUNG\nREG TALBOT\nFACES FOCUS | Personal Opinion\nAn unknown policewoman being attacked by\nunknown body somewhere in Kensington\nrecently.\nDear Sir,\nJust two brief comments on the last Felix*\n1. Si Lyle's chairmanship of the Uniori\nMeeting which \"Culcutt\" describes as 'com-p let ely character less', could surely be better\ndescribed as 'completely efficient' \u2014 or pen\nty i aps Culcut^s presidential experience consisted more of trying to project his own views\non a meeting!\n2. / / \"Scrutiny is... a vehicle for propaganda\"( quote from your 'Literary Correspondent') then it is surely up to to those\npeople with other views to submit them in\nwriting to the Editor of Scrutiny. Such a magazine, like your own, can naturally only\npublish articles sent to it, so Christians and\nothers please take note (...paper, and pen\nto it\\). Remember 750 were sold this time.\nYours,\nGGEQDBI\nOUR PRINTER\nWing Commander\nROMAN GAR BY CZ ERN I AWSKI VIRTUTI MILITARI, O.B.E., CROIX DE GUERRE\nFor just over ten years now Felix has been\nprinted by West London Offset Co.\nand it seems an appropriate time for\nus to introduce our readers to the\nfounder and director of the firm, Wing\nCommander R. Garby- Czerniawski was\nthe head of the Allied Intelligence organisation in occupied France during the last war,\nwas described by the Germans as \"a legendary man\", and has just published a book\n' THE BIG NETWORK\", telling the story of this\norganisation for the first time.\nWing Commander Garby was born in\nsouthern Poland in 1910 and joined the Polish\nAir Force im rr jedi at ely after matriculating\nfrom school, having always wanted to be a pilot. Immediatelv before the last war he was\nthe leader of the Polish aerobatics team; he\nthen entered the General Stafl College,\nlearning the French language and the\nbasic principles of intelligence operations as\npart pi the syllabus. When France fell he\nfound himself travelling across occupied\ncountry and observing almost without effort\nthe positions, the destinations, the strength\nand so on of the German troops that he\npassed. He decided then that he could, if he\nchose to remain in France, set up and run\nan intelligence organisation which could be\nof the greatest value to the Allies. The story\nt> f how he did this is told fully in \" THE BIG\nNETWORK\".\nWhen the network was finally broken by\nthe Germans, its leader was imprisoned, but\nmanaged to escape to England. There he\njoined the Polish General Stafl, and after the\nwar he was the Director of Resettlement for\nthe Polish Air Force. Having resettled 12,000\nmen, in 1949 he finally set about the task\nof entering civilian life in England, having\nbeen in uniform for the whole of his adult\nlife- In spite of all the difficulties and setbacks he has now built up a successful bus i ness, and although he has many claims to\nfame remains a modest, sur pr singly mild\nman. Felix and the Union have to thank\nhim for all his interest, enthusiasm and hard\nwork for us during the past ten v ears: during\nall this time, in spite of all the usual\ncontretemps. Felix has never been out late.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION NO. 169 FRIDAY, 8TH DECEMBER 1961. PRICE 4D. GUILDS IN GREAT FORM SPANNER-BEARERS SENTENCED\nOn Thursday November 30th1961 Guilds\nheld their second Union Meeting this term\nin room 04. This meeting was well up to the\nstandard of the previous one due to some\nhard work behind the scenes in preparation\nfor the trial of the Spanner-bearers. The trial\nwas successful in that they were convicted\nand subsequently thrown into the R_ound\nPond.\nOpening the meeting at 115 p.m. Guilds'\nPresident, Lawrie Austin, called for a Boomalacka to ensure that the meeting was qu or ate; room 04 was shaken to its foundations\nby the blast. There was a quorum. Secretary\nMax Finney eventually read the minutes under extremely trying conditions, as the number density of decayed grocery round his\nhead was unusually high. At this point a young lady from R.C.S. was observed to be\npresent: blood was called for but the President rightly decided that this could only\nbe brought up under A. O.B. The only item\nof correspondence was a letter from all eleven\nundergraduate Guildswomen challenging all\nGuildsmen (1200) to a game of hockey. The\nmeeting decided that it was not going to take\nthis lying down (\"We don't take it standing\nup either!\", said an irate Guildsman). Mr. G. Brough was unanimously elected Captain ^f the men's team.\nThe President announced that Sunday,\nJanuary 21st,1962 was to be a Sport Day\nagainst RCS with 5 rug ger,4 Soccer, 2 Hockey, 2 Darts, 2, Dominoes, 2 Bridge, 2 Chess\nand 1 Tiddlywinks teams from each college.\nKick off /bully off/ middle-for-diddle /first\ndrop/ opening bid /first move/ first squid ge was to be at 2.15 p.m. The contests were to\nbe kept to departments as much as possible.\nReports were received and adopted from\nBernie Liberman on Morphy Day (\"We\nwon!\"), from Harry Watson on the Brighton Run, and from the President himself on\nthe Lord Mayor's Show. Mr. Liberman also\nintroduced the meeting to the Morphy Day\nsong (lyrics by 1st year Civil, music by\nFlanders and Swann). The Swimming Gala\nwas also announced \u2014 see this page for de-tails.\nThe trial of the Spanner-bearers is reported\nfully in our Legal Column, but the outcome\nwas never in doubt due to the excellent behaviour of the jury, who maintained a barrage of assorted missiles, all aimed in the\ngeneral direction of the officials.\nHaving sentenced the Spanner-bearers and\nconcluded the trial, the President announced\nAOB. Under the vigilant eyes of Dr. Vest,\nthe RCS intruder was brought forward together with her Guildsman escort, one Mr.\nJ. Klascka, aged 21, of no fixed address.\nThe case was speedily and summarily dealt\nwith, and they were both sentenced to join\nthe convicted Spanner-bearers in the Round\nPond. The meeting was then adjourned to\nthe Round Pond where 350 Guildsmen saw\nthat juts tice took its course. The Spannerbearers and Mr. Klascka took to the water\ngracefully, especially Mr. White, whose long\nwhite corns were much admired. In deference to her sex, the RCS lady merely had\nher feet paddled in the water by the now,\nbrighter-than-white Spanner-bearers.\nA stray police-woman joined the throng in\npursuit, it later transpired, of a cork annul us of unknown use, but the meeting assumed\nthat she wanted to join the Union, and her\napplication was accepted with acclaim. Indeed, she was lifted shoulder high to the accompaniment of a Boomalacka.\nAfter a short horn recital by Chem. Eng.\nfrom the bandstand, the parry was returning towards the Union when the President\nrealised that he hadn't concluded the meet-ting (idiot!), so this was done with due ceremony on the Albert Memorial. Guilds' contribution to the IC Carnival was started by\nasking a penny each in return for permission to leave the Memorial enclosure. The\nsum of \u00a31 \u2022 18.10 was collected. The meeting closed at 2.50 p.m., but at 3.15,' several\nGuildsmen were still playing hop-scotch with\na stray copper on the zebra-crossing.\nSWIMMING GALA At last the day of the I.C. Swimming Gala\nat U.L U. has arrived. After all the plugging\nit has received I.C. will be turning out in\nforce and who knows, perhaps a little sport\nmay be had. I.C. and U.L. U. in close proximity seems a promising situation for a start.\nCoaches have been provided by the three\nconstituent colleges for your convenience.\nThese will leaving Guilds' Entrance (Exhib-it ion Road), the Chemistry building and the\nMines' Entrance at 5.30 p.m. today and passengers are advised to get there early. If you\nmiss the coach take the Piccadilly Line from\nSouth Kensington to Goodge Street, or a73 bus from outside the Albert Hall which passes Goodge Street Station. U.L. U. is in Malet\nStreet quite near to the station.\nAll who are going are asked to take their\nI.C. Union Cards; U.L. U. Cards are not necessary in spite of what the commission aire may tell you. The President of I.C. has arranged with U.L. U. President for I.C. to be\nexempted from the rule which states that\nstudent must carry UL. U. Cards as well\nas their college Cards-\n"

The purpose is to raise money for a charity which\nthe Union chooses. Direct financial help is\nimpossible for a student, dependent himself on\nanother body for hi is livelihood, but his energy and ideas can be tapped to help t ne needy.\nIn other parts of the country, Universities\nand Colleges run \"rag\" days, and raising\nmoney this way is necessarily by plaguing the\ncommunity for a day or so with typical student pranks, enjoyed by nearly all. The location of Imperial College does not allow this\nmethod and the result is the more sophisticated Imperial College Carnival. Until a tradition is well established this is a more difficult\nway of making money- It means that IC must\ndevelop methods such as the garden fe te, but\nmore must be done to bring in the residents\nof the neighbourhood. It is these people that\nshould be brought to take part in the Carnival not only with a view to raise money,\nbut also with the aim of creating a good relationship between them and the College.\nImperial College Carnival should benefit the\nCollege, the neighbourhood and above all,\nthe Charity.\nMuch work must be done throughout the\nyear to help this year's Carnival, and to lay\nthe way for future Carnivals. I would like\nto make an appeal for helpers; you can help\nothers as you are being helped by those\nwho are sending you to University.\nJON BAREFORD\nPlease help this man: he is the Carnival\nOrganiser, Jon Bareford.

Opera and Ballet\nAlthough Christmas is still some way off,\none must be thinking in terms of the New\nYear if one wishes to see of the more popular\nOperas and Ballets in London, so great is\nthe demand for seats; and the following brief\nnotes are written with that in mind.\nParrault's well known fairy tale \"Cinder-ella\" has been a source of inspiration to no\nless 'then three operatic composers; Rossini,\nMassenet and Wolf-Ferrari all producing\noperas on this theme at various times in the\n19th and 20th centuries. However, only one\nof these works has survived the test of time\nand is still regularly re vie ved on the stage.\nThis is Rossini's version which can be seen\nat Sadler's Wells during the Christmas season (Dec. 20th&26 th, Jan 6th&16 th). The same) fairy tale also attracted the\nRussian composer Prokofiev which le to the\nproduction in Moscow in 1945 of his full-length ballet \"Zalushka\" (The Ash-girl). This\nrapidly became very popular in Western\nEurope and is regularly revived at Covent\nGarden under the title of \"Cinderella\". These\nperformances, along with /those at Sadler's Wells mentioned above, provide an almost\nunique opportunity of seeing the same performed in the two different mediums of\nOpera and Ballet. The leading ballerinas of\nthe Royal Ballet will alternate in the title\nrole with evening performances on Jan. 19th,13 th,15 th,17 th and 25th while the exacting role of the Jeser will be shared between\nGrant and Shaw.\nFelix\nPub Guide\nNo. 4.

Prosecuting: Mr Perry Libermason, G.C.E. Defending: Dr. Row Pindi Jossstik.\nThis interesting test case shows that criminal law, civil law, slapstick and cabaret combined need not prejudice the chances of obtaining a conviction. Indeed, the jury-cum-public gallery participation which distinguished this trial could well enliven many\nmagistrates' sessions.\nThe court officials entered the court in a hail of escorted m' ssi les and order was obtained with difficulty. The foreman of the\njury was elected by unilateral vote, i.e. his\nown and swore at the jury to their evident\ndi satisfaction. Christopher John Liddle, aged\n21, unemployed casual labourer at present\nliving in a men's hostel and Jonathan White,\naged 21, unemployed and of no fixed ad-dress, were charged jointly with wilful negligence allowing certain persons unknown\nto extract from their possession the Beloved\nSpanner and thus failing to fulfil their duties\nto the Union. Both defendants pleaded not\nguilty.\nProsecuting counsel called two witnesses;\nMr. Mike Hunt and Mr. Tiger Barron. Mr.\nBarron's professed inability to read caused\nsome difficulty, but both witnesses testified\nto the accused s' negligence in allowing the\nsaid Spanner to travel unaccompanied. In\nhis cross examination Dr. Josstik sought to\nshow that both prosecution witnesses were\ndrunk at the time and that the evidence was\ntherefore invalid. The jury did not agree and\nshowered defending counsel with a variety\nof rotten fruit, etc.\nDr. Josssrjk called in two mey i ical ad-vis ers; Dr. T.S. Tickles examined Mr. White\nbehind a temporary screen in the courtroom\nand Mr. White's unusual taste in underwear\ncaused a titter to run round the room. Dr.\nTickles announced that accused was too\nshort and ribald comments from the jury\nhad to be suppressed. Dr. Thelma Vest, a German ph ys colo gist, explained the struggle\nshe had with Liddle on her couch to sympathetic cheers from the jury and announced\nthat accused was complex and difficult 10\nhandle. At this point Mr. Harburn, an amateur footballer, bel'eve d to be living in a hostel for Distressed Gentlefolk, was observed to hurl an egg at the judge, who how-ever, observing that the jury was behind him,\ndid not order his suppression. Dr. Jossstik,\ncompeting with the growing tumult from the\njurors and partly obscured by the toilet rolls\naimed at him, put forward two pleas of diminished re sposi bil 'ty, for Liddle on the\ngrounds that he was a congenital idiot and\nfor White on the grounds that he was too\nshort. The jury and the judge agreed with\nthe mental and physical states of the accused,\nbut though that this was no excuse, and directed each other accordingly, Mr. Harburn\nthrew another e ge to emphasise the point and\nthe missile struck a gentleman of the Press\non his top-hat.\nThe verdict of gull tv was never in doubt\nand the result was received with acclaim and\nanother egg from Harburn, together with sundry objects proceeding in the general direction\nof the convicted who were hampered in their\nretaliation by the fact that they were standing in dustbins. When asked if they had anything to say Mr. White announced that he\nwas pregnant and Mr. Liddle confessed to\nbeing responsible. The jury collapsed in\nlaughter and Mr. Harburn threw yet another egg.\nJudge Lol donned the black cap (curious-ly reminiscent of a festering pair of soccer\nshorts) and pro nunc ed the sentence: that the\nconvicted be taken to the Round Pond,\nthere to be washed till they be cleansed of\ntheir sins. A pleasantly informal touch was\nthe way in which the iur v collared the prisoner immediately and assisted in the ex-ecu tion. FILM\nWILL HAY\nand\nOH! MR. PORTER\nIn the late thirties Will Hay, having already made an impact with his highly successful Music Hall sketches, appeared in a series of films which were gloriously comic\nwith typical English humour. Hay had made\nfilms earlier but his best were made for the\nold Gainsborough Company and resulted\nfrom brilliant teamwork, Graham Moffatt\nand Moore Marriott appeared with Hay,\nMarcel Varnel directed and the script writers\nand technicians were retained for successive\nfilms, Albert (Graham Moffatt) is modelled\non Dicken's fat boy Joe from Pickwick plus\nperhaps Billy Bunter. He is bullied by Hay\nto comply but only reluctantly does so after\nshowing his own independence first- Har>\nbottle (Moore Marriott) is a stubborn old man\nfull of advice wh i oh, after Hay has rejected\nit, invariably turns out to have been sound.\nEveryone has met an old fogey like Harbottle. Hay is their leader full of ludicrous\nideas, always extracting his band from one\nuncomfortable situation only to land them in\nanother. He chooses to take un fam l 'ar characters and poke fun at them \u2014 a station\nMaster in \"Oh\\Mr. Porter\", a fireman in\n\"Where's that Fire\", a policeman in \"Ask a Policeman'\" a convict in \"Convict 99\", and\na British explorer in \"Old Bones of the\nRiver\". \"Ohl Mr. Porter\" is his best-loved\ncomedy. Hay is station master of a very small\nstation in rural Ireland \u2014 Buggleskelly, which\nthe railway company seems to have forgotten\nabout. All are lost in a world of their own,\nproud of their sel^-inflated importance and\ntheir old engine Gladstone. Peace reigns. The\nsignal box is used as a greenhouse. The village gossips. Then the smugglers appear to\nbreak the quiet and the highlight is a chase\nin Gladstone, remarkable not only for it brilliant comic impact but also for the superb\nphotography. Marcel Varnel directs and edits the film with crisp smoothness and the\nwhole dialogue sparkles throughout.\nA. J. WALKER\nThe accused: White and Liddle in dustbins. The Rt. Hor. Judge Lol Austin B. Sc.,\nA. C.G.I. "
