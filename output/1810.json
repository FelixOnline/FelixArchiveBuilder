    "content": "munication with school kids, and they were teaching\nthings like science magic tricks to perform at museums\nto get kids interested.\nThere\u2019s so much interesting stuff out there. When I\nfinished my PhD another research position had come\nupatauniversityanditwasresearchingicecream.Iwas\nthinking \u2018why did I not do my PhD in ice cream???\u2019; it\nwas about the textures and flavours, it was awesome.\nI get so much FOMO when I hear other people\u2019s research and think that it\u2019s fantastic! I have a friend who\ndanced her PhD about healthy ageing \u2013 she did a dance\nperformance in front of her examiners. There are all\nsorts of things to do.\nIt sounds like the book would be helpful in\ngetting people to want to go back into research too.\nThe whole point of research is to expand our knowledge as a human race, and one of the things we really\nlearnt during lockdown was that we\u2019re nothing without the arts and humanities. The things people missed\nthe most were going out to the theatre and cinema,\nlistening to bands, going to eat at restaurants, watching football matches, all those arts and leisure, sociable\nthings that set us apart as humans. That\u2019s our main\ndistinction \u2013 we can be artistic, creative, imaginative.\nCreativity and advancement of human knowledge isn\u2019t\njust about what technology we can build or getting to\nMars.\nOne of our editors recently wrote about the\nlack of humanities at Imperial \u2013 we have\nquite a limited view of the humanities and\narts in general.\nYeah, there are all these distinctions, even at school\nwhen you\u2019re selecting your choices, sometimes people\nare pressured to choose one over the other. When I\nwas at school I loved art, but also really loved science,\nand they pushed me to do an extra science or further\nmaths, but I wanted to do art and drama as well.\nKeeping education broad and not making people feel\nthey have to drop things they love is really important.\nDo you have any personal notes for women\nin STEM and in the research industry?\nIt\u2019s still very tough to be a woman in STEM or\nresearch, it really is. It\u2019s getting better and more\nwomen are getting into these careers, but it\u2019s also still\nvery white. I\u2019m mindful as a\nwhite woman, when I talk about\nus progressing, that, looking\naround meeting rooms, while\nthere are more women, we\u2019re\nall very white. Diversity still\nreally needs to be worked on,\nand because it\u2019s so tough, there\u2019s\nsometimes pressure from universities and society to try and\nact stereotypically male \u2013 to be\nstrong, not show emotions, and\nact in a certain way \u2013 to get to\nmore senior positions. We\u2019re\nstill not really allowed to lead as\nourselves. If you do progress into\na research career, try not to be\npressured too much by that and\nact stereotypically male to do\nwell. I think the author of Lean\nIn \u2013 Sheryl Sandberg \u2013 regrets\nwriting that book now, because\nit was all about acting like a man\nand power posing. If you do get into those careers,\nmentor other people as well, and shout about other\nwomen\u2019s achievements. Help each other out rather\nthan going down the route of not bothering about the\npeople coming up behind you. The more women we\nhelp out the more we can get in the door, and that\u2019s\nwhat we want \u2013 more women sticking around in these\nkinds of careers.\nWhat advice would you give to the students\nat Imperial about studying at university\nand getting graduate jobs and developing\ntheir careers?\nI think young people get a rough ride these days;\nthere\u2019s social stigma that young people are on their\nphones all the time, obsessed with social media and\nhow they look, that they\u2019re a bit empty-headed and\nlazy, and don\u2019t have ambition. Every generation had\nthat, and every time the older generation thinks \u2018we\nweren\u2019t as lazy or feckless as kids are today\u2019. But you\u2019ve\nhad a really rough time, and the past two years you\u2019ve\nmissed out on loads of education and social skills\ndevelopment.\nI would just say: be kind to yourself, you\u2019re living in\ntough times, and you do have your whole life ahead of\nyou. There\u2019s a whole world of opportunities open to\nyou, because people are breaking things like gender\nstereotypes. Don\u2019t necessarily see your career as just\none thing \u2013 you might end up doing a whole range of\nthings, and that\u2019s fine. If you fail sometimes that\u2019s also\nfine, because to get anything done right you have to fail\na few times. Try not to let it get you down. It\u2019s all learning in the end, and if you\u2019re in the privileged position\nto have the time and money to travel \u2013 travel while you\ncan!\nI just want to point out that within the book\nResearcHER and Women in Academia network\nwe\u2019re a space who support and are inclusive of gender\nnon-conforming, non-binary, trans sisters as well.\nWhen we talk about being \u2018for women\u2019, we don\u2019t mean\ncis-gendered, heterosexual women, we mean anyone\nwho feels they identify in our space. That\u2019s important\nbecause, at the moment in places like the US and UK,\nunfortunately transgender and non-conforming people are also getting a super rough time. We\u2019re here to\npromote the inclusivity of people like that in research\nas well!\nFollow the Women in Academia Support Network\nat:\nTwitter: @wiasnofficial\nFacebook: Women in Academia Support\nNetwork Page\nWebsite: www.wiasn.com\nFRIDAY 28TH OCTOBER 2022\n21\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\nIF YOU DO GET INTO\nTHOSE CAREERS,\nMENTOR OTHER PEOPLE\nAS WELL, AND SHOUT\nABOUT OTHER WOMEN\u2019S\nACHIEVEMENTS\nBOOKS\n\n"

    "content": "Since the early 2000s, e-commerce has grown mas-sively, and continues to expand, as new innovations\nemerge. These innovations enter the market, offering\nbetter service, faster delivery, quality, and affordabili-ty. We have seen the rise of online payment, ultra-fast\nfashion, advertisement technologies, etc. However, not\nall of them are available everywhere. At the end of the\nday, human needs are similar, so there is a huge opportunity in localising products.\nY Combinator is an American startup accelerator\nwhich launched over 3000 companies since 2005, including Airbnb, Coinbase, DoorDash, Reddit, Stripe\nand Twitch. Jonathan Aeschlimann is a serial entrepreneur backed by Y Combinator, and is now targeting this gap through his two companies, DivBrands\nand Conversion Pattern. We will be looking into the\nDivBrands this week.\nCEO Bio: Jonathan Aeschlimann\nDivbrands.io co-founder. The company founded in\n2018 reached a revenue of $35 million and has a remote team of over 100. Received executive education\nat Stanford GSB and Chicago Booth.\nDivBrands: From 0 to $35M Annual Revenue\nin 3 Years\nDivBrands operates like an in-house product incu-bator, using data-driven methods to discover new demands in everyday apparel products - such as slippers,\ntactical hoodies and cargo pants. Then it works with\nmanufacturers and designers, and turns these products\ninto something that solves real problems. The company\nhas already launched 17 brands, and employed 100+\nremote members in 26 countries.\nThe First Steps to Building DivBrands\n\u201cFind the right products that customers really want\nthrough hypothesis,\ntesting and iterations.\u201d\nDivbrand\u2019s product development\nprocess started from\nextracting insights\nfromdataandraising\nhypotheses. To test\nthe hypothesis, they\ndesign the product\nat a creative studio\nin Cape Town, purchase a small quanti-tyfromsuppliers,ad-vertise to customers\nandreviewcampaign\nperformance. After products are delivered, they survey\nthe customers, categorize their feedback, and absorb\nthem into the design iteration. Eventually, they make\nstrategic decisions such as whether to grow that brand\nor to change its direction.\nAnother thing that worth notice is that, although\nDivbrands is paying close attention to trends and evaluating internal opportunities, they only choose a very\nlimited number of products to act on.\nData-Driven Sales\n\u201cThe key to growing sales is to see what customers\nsee. In other words, to find out, within the miscellaneous information demonstrated to customers, what exactly works.\u201d\nWhat rocketed Divbrand sales were social media. In\n2017 when most people had a phone, they were used to\n\u201cscrolling\u201d endlessly for more newsfeed. So Divbrands\nrealised, to attract customers\u2019 attention, they needed to\nimplement effective scroll stoppers. These are the first\nthree to five seconds of a video that are very catchy and\nmakes you want to stay. They then developed 10-20\nvariations of scroll-stoppers and adopted the one that\nworked better.\nData analytics is written into the gene of Divbrands.\nA prominent example is their new product launch.\n\u201cFor the front-end, clicking, average time spent on a\npage and behaviours are important measures that help us\nfigure out what obstructs consumers from buying. For the\nback-end, metrics such as manufacturing cost and shipping cost are closely monitored to guide strategic decisions.\nOur decisions are largely based on data. There is little\nspace for non-substantiated, unsupported ideas.\u201d\nOptimising Logistics as a Startup\nToday\u2019s consumers are almost \u201cspoiled\u201d by next-day\ndelivery and free returns. However, for smaller D2C\ncompanies that have yet to reach economics of scale, it\nis not easy to offer a cheap and fast delivery service for\ncustomers. According to Jonathan, their secret sauce to\nbringing down logistic cost is to lower the return rate.\n\u201cIf shipping a bag costs $5, returning it would cost $8,\nin which $6 is the small-quantity shipping cost and $2\nis the inspection fee. To further plague the problem, the\nindustry also lacks reverse-logistics providers.\u201d\n\u201cOne of our solutions is to be transparent to customers,\nmeaning to provide clear descriptions of a product and\navoid exaggeration. For example, we would clarify that\na water resistant shoe is \u2018waterproof\u2019. Another key strategy is to allow selection on product category. For example,\nfast-fashion apparel by nature have a high return rate,\nlaundry, footwear, products with elastic materials such as\npolyesters.\u201d\nJonathan also mentioned the evolving landscape of\ndata-driven marketing. Nowadays, due to increased\ncustomer preference for anonymity, less data is available for marketers. The gap between what data marketers are allowed to access and the data they need to\nupgrade products is huge. This is especially true for\ne-commerce companies which \u201cbreathe\u201d on data. So,\nthey face a struggle to ensure advertisement is relevant\nto their viewers. Thus, Jonathan co-founded Conversion Pattern to solve this problem. It is essentially a\nwebsite tag manager that tracks purchases, gathering\ndata across devices and through ad blockers, aiming to\nenable smaller companies to make the transition to a\ncookie-less era.\nOur next edition will take a closer look into marketing technology and Conversion Pattern. Stay tuned.\nInterview with Jonathan Aeschliman\nEntrepreneur Spotlight\nAshley Xu\nBusiness Editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n22 Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: ASHLEY XU\nBusiness\nJonathan Aeschelimann\n\n"

However, they have\nnow banded together with the other\ntwo staff unions to reject a 3.3% pay rise,\nasking for a 10.9% increase instead.\nImperial College London reported\nspending\u00a3593.2minstaffcostsofwhich\n\u00a3486.3m went to salaries and wages (the\nrest went into pension contributions),\nand had a surplus of \u00a322.8m in the\nfinancial year ending in July 2021,\naccording to the Higher Education\nStatistics Authority (HESA).\nWhen compared to the previous\nfinancial year (Jul 2019-20), Imperial\nCollege spent 7.8% more in staff costs.\nThis does not account for inflation.\nAccording to an annual report by\nthe College, they reported their total\ncomprehensive income for the year as\n\u00a3161.7m, a 31.6% increase from the\n2019/20 year.\nLast week, the JTU sent an email to\nPresident Hugh Brady and Provost Ian\nWalmsley, requesting a meeting with\nthe pay negotiation team to reach an\n\u201cagreement on how pay at Imperial can\nbe improved this year\u201d, citing that both\nImperial UCU and Imperial Unite had\nconducted a ballot that resulted in a\nstriking mandate, and that Imperial\nUNISON were going to be balloting\ntheir members.\nUCU:\nThe UCU conducted a national pay\nand working conditions ballot on 24th\nOctober,inwhichtheyachievedturnout\nof 57.8%, with 81.1% of these voting yes\nto industrial action including strikes.\nThey demand \u201ca meaningful pay rise to\ndeal with the cost-of-living crisis\u201d. They\njustify that universities can \u201cmore than\nafford to meet staff demands\u201d because\nthe UK university sector generated a\nrecord income of \u00a341.1bn in the last\nyear, while spending on staff increased\nby \u00a3200m.\nImperial\u2019s branch of the UCU have\nconducted their own local ballot, in\nwhich they achieved a 61.2% turnout\n(\u201dhighesteverrecordedinsuchaballot\u201d),\nwith 79.5% voting in favour of industrial\naction including a strike, and 87.8%\nvoting in favour of industrial action\nshort of a strike. This gives Imperial\u2019s\nUCU members the mandate to take\nindustrial action over the pay dispute\nat any point over the next six months,\nand they are under a legal obligation to\ninform employers two weeks in advance\nof any strike action.\nUnite:\nOn 19th\nOctober, Imperial\u2019s branch\nof Unite the Union (Imperial Unite)\npublished a Facebook post, in which\nthey reported a turnout of over 50%\n(the legal required threshold). 79.05%\nof respondents voted in favour of taking\nindustrial action. In another ballot,\nthe legal threshold was reached again,\nin which 79.49% voted in favour of\nindustrial action including striking and\n87.82% voted in favour of industrial\naction short of a strike.\nOf the members who voted in the\nImperial Unite ballot, 79.49% voted\nin favour of industrial action including\nstriking, and 87.82% voted in favour of\nindustrial action short of a strike.\nThey will now be balloting members\non \u201cindustrial action in support of\n[JTU\u2019s]jointpayclaim\u201d.Theyconcluded\nthe post stating that \u201cstrike action\nremains our least favourable option\u201d,\nbut that they are looking for \u201ca fair and\nappropriate pay offer which recognises\nthe cost of living crisis facing members\u201d.\nOriginally, JTU based their request\nfor a 10.9% increase on a Bank of\nEngland projection of an 8% inflation\nrate on the June 2021 CPIH (Consumer\nPrices Index plus owner-occupiers\u2019\nhousing cost) value in the second\nquarter of 2022.

    "content": "Imperial College staff are in the\nmiddle of a historic pay dispute with\nthe College, and students are facing\nincredible challenges in finding a\nway to afford staying at university.\nJust yesterday, the College\nannounced a one-off\npayment for staff, with the\nlowest paid (ahem Felix\nEditor) getting the highest\namount of \u00a31000, while\nthe highest paid earners\nlike the President and\nProvost will receive\n\u00a3400. This comes\nafter the Provost\nBoard rejected the Joint\nTrade Unions\u2019 inflation-matched pay claim for 10.9%\nin May. The sudden announcement\nalso arrived at the Felix inbox at 2pm\non Thursday, 3 hours before we go to\nprint,andalmostexactly48hoursafter\nI asked the College for a comment on\nwhat they were doing to avoid strikes\nanddisruptionstostudents\u2019education.\nStudents are facing down a harsh\nwinter, but majority don\u2019t qualify for\nhardship funding like the Student\nSupport Fund, which received a \u00a3500k\nboost yesterday. The requirements\nare being reassessed continuously to\n\u201censure that the fund remains fit-forpurpose\u201d, but it\u2019s likely that a large\nproportionofstudentswillnotqualify,\nand that\u2019s not what it\u2019s there for.\nAdditionally, the 1.1% raise for the\ntop earners means that College leaders\nthemselveshavegottenapermanent4k\nboost at the very least. That\u2019s relatively\nfine when compared to other ways the\nCollege is gathering money for their\n\u201cunexpectedlyhighenergybills\u201d.Inthe\nlast year, Imperial\u2019s very own nursery\nraised their prices by 3% (higher than\nthe average increase in staff salary),\nin an economy that reports\nthat mothers give up\ntheir jobs as a result\nof not being able to\nafford childcare. For\nthose women with\ntwo or more children\nunder the age of\ntwo, it just doesn\u2019t\nmake financial sense\nto be working. These\nwomen are then classed as\n\u201ceconomically inactive\u201d, as if the\nchoice to not be working and maintain\nsome sort of financial independence\nis just about being inactive, and\nthat a mother isn\u2019t paid for the\nhours of unpaid work that goes into\nhousehold chores and raising a child.\nIn fact, this is why a charity called\nPregnant Then Screwed is taking to\nthe streets on Halloween to march,\nand are demanding increased\nfunding for the childcare sector to\nenable affordable and high quality\nchildcare for all children, properly\npaid maternity AND paternity leave,\nand for all jobs to be flexible by\ndefault, rather than as an added \u2018extra\u2019.\n31% of new parents will not be able\nto afford another child, and 43%\nof mothers are considering leaving\ntheir job because of childcare costs.\n2\nJamie John\nDeputyEditor\nandChiefSci-enceEditor\nSam Lovatt\nManaging\nEditor\nHahyun Lee\nComment\nEditor\nJonah Hewett FilmEditor\nI promise to drecit\nall of you next\nweek!s\nCopyeditors\nTara PalChaudhuri\nMusicEditor\nJoe Riordan MusicEditor\nZanna Buckland BooksEditor\nZhifan Xu BusinessEditor\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\u2018Rady and Walms get \u00a3\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

Also, when we looked\nat what books were out there to encourage young girls\ninto research, they are heavily science-based, and very\nmuch around the work of historically famous scientists \u2013 big, huge discoveries \u2013 but not everyone makes\nhuge discoveries. Sometimes contributions to knowledge don\u2019t always make the press. We wanted to give\nyoung girls a better idea of different kinds of research\nyou can do, that it doesn\u2019t always have to be done in\na lab, and that there\u2019s a whole range of careers availa-ble. You don\u2019t have to be world-leading scientists, and\nsometimes research can be contributing in a small way\nto a bigger discovery.\nHow did you and your colleagues go about\ncollecting and writing the profiles up?\nOne of our co-authors who helped collect profiles\nto actually be included in the book is co-founder and\ndirector of a charity called \u2018Women in Academia Support Network\u2019. We have over 13,000 members from\nover a hundred countries across the globe, from early\ncareer stages (people just studying for their doctor-ates) all the way up to vice-chancellors of universities.\nWe thought the best place to start was asking our\nmembers who wants to be included, so a call went\nout for chapter contributions, then when we got\nthem back, we chose a range of career trajectories. For\nexample, we\u2019ve got some women who have only just\nfinished their PhD along with some professors, and we\nwanted a range of global perspectives as well. It\u2019s still\nquite heavily UK-based because a lot of our membership is European, but there are people in there from\nthe USA, for example, to try and demonstrate the\ndiversity of where women researchers are in the world.\nDid contributors write their own sections,\nor did you write for them?\nThey did, yes, we gave them a rough writing frame.\nWe tried to think about what people would want to\nknow about science and research. We asked them to\nprovide a bit about their background, because often\nyou think of researchers as quite wealthy, well-to-do\npeople, who went to the\nbest universities, so we\nwanted to demonstrate\nthat all kinds of people\nfrom various backgrounds\ngo into research. They\nwrote a bit of a bio about\nwhere they came from,\nwhere they lived, how they\ngot interested in research, and another part about\ntheir current research topic. There are people researching things like goth metal rock as a disabled person, all\nthe way up to the hard sciences. Then, in each chap-ter, they would give an activity or insight into their\nresearch that readers could have a go at, to get away\nfrom this idea that to conduct research you have to\nhave a fancy lab setup or load of equipment.\nWould you say you\u2019re trying to target\nyounger boys, as well as young girls?\nYeah, the book had two aims, the first was to elevate\nthe voice of women\u2019s contributions in research. That\u2019s\nfor everybody to read about the fascinating research\nthat\u2019s happening in the world \u2013 for any gender, whatever end of the spectrum you\u2019re on. The second aim\nwas to encourage young people to go on to research\ncareers, and particularly young girls from geographical\nareas where they\u2019re unlikely to do that.\nIs there a career profile in the book that\nparticularly resonates with you?\nThere is one: Professor Jackie Carter. We were actually at the same university as each other for a while.\nJackie had a very similar trajectory in research to me;\nshe was working class, and not many working-class\npeople, let alone women, end up at university in the\nfirst place, let alone continuing to a doctorate. She\u2019s\nalso a mum; when she was studying for her PhD she\nhad young kids, and I did too when studying for mine.\nIn fact, I went to university late because I was from\na working-class background, and nobody really had aspirations for me. Careers advice was rubbish even though I really liked science.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with any job you\ntake up, they just didn\u2019t talk to us about\na range of jobs. It was very much: you\u2019re\nfrom a council estate, you\u2019re obviously\ngoingtoworkinashop,orforgirlsbeali-brarian or a teacher. It was very gendered\nand a narrow description of what you\ncould be. That\nspoke to me\nabout Jackie\u2019s\nstory as well,\nthat she had a\nsimilar experi-ence.\nI didn\u2019t sit\nmy final exams\nfor my degree\nuntil I was 32, two weeks before my first son was born.\nI didn\u2019t go to a university, I did the Open University,\nso six years part-time whilst working in a shop. Jackie\u2019s\nstory was also similar in how she ended up at university \u2013 she became a maths teacher and then went on to\ndo a PhD, and now she\u2019s a professor, so that\u2019s fantastic.\nIt makes you feel not so alone that there\u2019s such a range\nof people out there going to university, doing degrees,\nand carrying on into senior roles. It\u2019s hidden because\nwe don\u2019t talk about our backgrounds much, which is\nwhy we were encouraging people to write more about\ntheir backgrounds and not just the research they do.\nHow have your personal experiences influenced the writing of the book, and your\napproach to communicating your points\nabout research careers?\nMy experience of careers education \u2013 I don\u2019t know\nwhat it\u2019s like outside of the UK \u2013 but I became a qualified careers advisor and worked for about ten years in\n\u2018underserved\u2019 areas or \u2018areas of deprivation\u2019, places like\nWythenshawe in Manchester. I grew up in Wythenshawe myself, it\u2019s one of the largest council estates in\nthe UK \u2013 it was shocking that even all those years later\nafter I\u2019d left school, the kids who finished school and\nwanted to go to work or college were still getting the\nsame rubbish careers advice and being written off. I\nwanted to write a book that spoke to a wider audience\nand could show what was available for them, even if\nyou didn\u2019t perform particularly well at school or didn\u2019t\nknow what you wanted to do for a long time. I wanted to show that you\u2019ve got the whole of your life to\ndevelop, it\u2019s not necessarily something that happens at\nsixteen. Even when choosing what options you wanted\nto take for GCSEs, your career still might change, and\nthere are opportunities for us late bloomers!\nDo you think that career advice in general\nhas improved a bit, or is there still a lot of\nroom for it to get better?\nFunnily enough, I think what helped was the global\npandemic, when across the world a lot of education\nmoved online, and because of that people in different\ncareers and in education started using social media\nmore. It forced more adults onto social media, and the\nexplosion of things like TikTok allowed more re\u201c\nTHERE ARE\nOPPORTUNITIES\nFOR US LATE\nBLOOMERS!\n\u201c\nWE CHOSE A\nRANGE OF CAREER\nTRAJECTORIES\nCredit: Envato Elements\nBOOKS\n19\n\n"

    "content": "Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nLast week, Professor Aoife Foley of\nQueen\u2019s University Belfast spoke\nto The Guardian about how leaving the\nclocks on British Summer Time (BST)\ninstead of reverting back to Greenwich\nMean Time (GMT) could save us\nall money on energy for heating and\nlighting in the winter. This year, autumn\ndaylight saving happens on Sunday\n30th October.\nDaylight saving is when the UK\u2019s\ntime zone goes back by one hour in\nthe winter\u2014this means there is more\nsunlight in the morning hours and less\nin the late afternoon and evening. The\nDaylight Saving Time (DST) time\nzone itself is equivalent to BST. Around\n70 other countries also follow this in\nspring and autumn with respect to their\nown time zones, many of these are in\nAmerica and Europe. The practice of\nbringing clocks forward by an hour in\nsummertime originated in the UK in the\nearly1900s,whenpeoplebegantonotice\nthat in summer, daylight hours weren\u2019t\nbeing utilised as effectively as they could\nbe. One person who was particularly\nresponsible for advocating the idea of\nchanging the UK\u2019s time zone in summer\nwas an English builder named William\nWillett.\nWillett wrote and published a\npaper called \u2018The Waste of Daylight\u2019\nwhich detailed his observations of\npeople wasting their time in bed in\nthe mornings and his logistical ideas\nabout implementing daylight saving.\nUnfortunately, Willett died in 1915,\na year before daylight saving practices\nwere actually started. Germany and\nBritain began observing it in 1916, as a\nmethod of conserving energy from\ncoal during World War One.\nAligning sleep schedules to\nmore closely match sunrise\nand sunset times meant\nless coal was required\nfor light and heating.\nHowever, it\nis important to\nnote that the\nidea of daylight\nsaving cannot\nbe attributed to\none individual,\nit being a notion\nthat many people\naround the world had\nconsidered in that era.\nIn 1895, New Zealander\nGeorge Hudson (an\nentomologist) wrote a\npaper for the Wellington\nPhilosophical Society on the\nbenefits of daylight saving for his\ninsect collecting activities.\nDaylight saving was implemented\nin even greater measures during the\nSecondWorldWar,andinresponseto\nfuel shortages in 1947, with what was\ncalled \u2018British Double Summer Time\u2019\n(BDST). Instead of going forward\none hour for summer, the clocks went\nforward two hours, so, for example, if\nthe sun was rising at 4am on GMT, it\nwould now be rising at 6am (GMT+2).\nThe original GMT period in winter was\nthen placed on regular DST (GMT+1).\nThis all sounds confusing, but\nessentially the logic was to maximise the\nuse of sunlight during commercial and\nsociable hours in order to reduce energy\nusage and waste. This was useful in the\nwar periods when everything was being\nrationed, from tyres to tea, and a large\nportion of the country\u2019s resources\nwere being redirected towards military\npurposes.\nThe British Government trialled\nusing DST continuously for three years\nfrom 1968 to 1971, arbitrarily calling\nit \u2018British Standard Time\u2019. During\nthis period the clocks remained on\nGMT+1, and various assessments\nof public responses were carried\nout. The most prominent aspect of\nthe Government\u2019s \u2018comprehensive\nreview\u2019 was data collected by the\nDepartment of Transport on\nroad accidents, as one of\nthe major consequences\nof daylight saving is\nthat there is more\ndaylight for evening\ntravel and less in\nthe morning. It was\nfound that overall,\nthe number of\npeople involved in\nserious accidents\n(deaths and severe\ninjuries) decreased\nby around 11%\ndespite there being\nan uptick in morning\nroad incidents. It is\ntheorised that low-light\naccidents are more likely\nto happen in the evening due\nto factors such as drivers being\nmore tired after work, and people\ntravelling to different places for\nsocial engagements or running\nerrands as opposed to the direct\njourneys between home and school\nor work in the morning.\nThe experiment was completed by\n1971duetoanoverwhelmingmajority\nof MPs voting for its discontinuation.\nThere was also some public resistance,\nand both MPs and citizens from\nthe northerly parts of the country\n(particularly Scotland) spoke about the\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n6\nEdited by: Marie Mori\nEnvironment\nPermanent BST: a bright\nidea or a dim one?\nAN AVERAGE\nHOUSEHOLD\nCOULD SAVE\n\u00a31.20 ON ENERGY\nPER DAY UNDER\nDST\n\u201c\n\n"

The\nmain protagonist is Juror #8, and he leads the charge\nto prove that there is a reasonable doubt in this case,\nwhile taking the audience on a journey with him as he,\nalong with fellow jurors, unravel the prosecution\u2019s case.\nIn doing this, the film leaves us with no definite conclusion as to whether the teenager did it, but it leaves\nus with reasonable doubt and allows us to question\nwhether he did it or not, treating the audience as if we\nwere jurors, and by not revealing the truth, we are also\nleft uncertain and left with reasonable doubt.\nInterestingly, the director revealed that he shot the\nfilm \u201cabove eye level\u201d in the first third of the\nfilm and \u201cbelow eye level\u201d in the final act, which had\nthe effect of the walls closing in and the ceiling lower-ing, used in order to not only make the jury trapped,\nbut also treat us as if we are entrapped with them.\nThedismantlingofgroupthinkandthewillpower\nof one\nThe term \u201cgroupthink\u201d was first mentioned in\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s 1984, and it is when you conform to\ngroup ideals to thrive within that group. The idea of\na jury inspires groupthink, with the need for a unanimous vote suggesting everyone should think the same.\nJuror #5 is intimidated at the start by Juror #3 and #10.\nHowever, it is the willpower of one man to go against\nthe group that drives the dismantling of groupthink.\nThe film masterfully presents this dismantling in a\nbelievable way, from the evidence presented by the\nswitchblade used in the murder, as well as the reliability of the witness statements, all the way to the defendant\u2019s thought processes. With each step, more and\nmore jurors have their minds changed.\nPrejudice and the shortcomings of juries in the\nAmerican judicial system\nOne standout scene is in the final\nact, where Juror #10\u2019s\nracial prejudices are fully exposed: \u201cI\u2019ve lived\namong them all my life;\nyou can\u2019t believe a word\nthey say.\u201d\nJuror #10 allows\nprejudice to cloud the\ndiscrepanciesthejurors\npresent to him, leading\nto a fit of rage. This\nthen causes Juror #5,\nwho grew up in \u201cslums\u201d\nand understands preju-dice, to finally stand up\nto him (literally), and\none by one, the jurors follow suit and stand up to face\naway from him. The silence says it all. A truly powerful scene, highlighting the shortcomings of the American judicial system, as people with prejudice can slip\nthrough the cracks of the judicial system and affect the\noutcome of a trial.\nThe misuse of power and the planting and payoff\nof Juror #3\nThe power of the jury is established even at the start\nof the film, where the jury is standing and the defendant is sitting. The levels show the power the jury has.\nThis film does very well to explore the misuse of power,\nfrom Juror #7 switching his verdict from guilty to not\nguilty just to leave the proceedings, to Juror #3 projecting his feelings about his son into the case. The film\n\u201cplants\u201d his thwarted relationship with his son as a key\nmotivator in the case: \u201cWhen he was 16, we had a fight.\nHit me on the jaw. He\u2019s a big kid. I haven\u2019t seen him for\ntwo years. Kids. Work your heart out.\u201d\nThe juror clearly sees himself and his son in the case,\nas that is the main reason why he can allow the case to\ngo to not guilty; he sees the case as what could be if his\nrelationship with his son is not repaired, and if he does\nnot accept responsibility. Interestingly, the thing that\nkept him stubborn was the very thing that caused him\nto change his vote to not guilty; his son, and that is the\n\u201cpayoff.\u201d\nI highly recommend that you watch this film; it is\njust that good!

    "content": "Speaking to Dr. Kelly Pickard-Smith:\nUnorthodox Research Careers and\nSmashing Stereotypes\nAuthor Interview\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\nTitle: ResearcHER\nPublisher: Emerald Publishing Group\nIhad the pleasure of a conversation with Dr. Kelly Pickard-Smith, one of the co-editors of the ResearcHER title. Her journey to a career in research has been long and\nfilled with a variety of internal and external barriers. As a young girl, she was faced with heavily stereotyped career advice that didn\u2019t properly prepare her to follow her\ngoals. Now a Culture and Community Research Fellow at the University of Manchester and Co-Founder of the Women in Academia Support Network Charity, Dr. Pickard-Smith strives to educate and raise awareness about the disparity between women and men in the research industry. The network also aims to support young girls and\nteenagers who want to get into research careers, as well as providing a platform for women around the world to share their stories. Read the full interview overleaf:\nted in a way that constitutes a clear and concise read.\nAn added \u2018Activity\u2019 section per chapter\ngives ResearcHER a fun and unique flair\nby describing thought exercises that anyone can do to participate in the chapter\u2019s\ndescribed field of research. It thus serves\nto highlight the point that anyone can\nwork in research, although it does seem\nthat the book is aimed at much younger\naudiences \u2013 an impression furthered by\nthe simplistic writing style used in most\nof it.\nThroughout, ResearcHER manages\nto present an ample breadth of experiences, owed to\nthe chapters being written by researchers of many different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, sexual\norientations, and gender identities. The book explores\nhow their identities and lives have shaped them both\npersonally and professionally, very often influencing\ntheir decisions to become researchers or their choice of\nresearch field. We see, for example, how one PhD candidate\u2019s Nigerian background has inspired her to study\nfamily planning in sub-Saharan Africa, or how another\nscientist\u2019s experiences with terrorism have motivated\nher to research trauma in relation to terrorist attacks.\nMany of these researchers live with disabilities or\nneurodivergence, and do not hesitate to talk about\ntheir struggles with the prejudice and lack of accommodation that often come hand in hand with these\nconditions. In general, ResearcHER does not shy away\nfrommentioningdifficultiesthatmightinterferewitha\ncareer in research \u2013 from illness to parenthood to poverty and abusive relationships \u2013 but it always remains\nappropriate for general audiences and does not go into\ngraphic detail.\nUnfortunately, the book\nappears to have a few editorial issues, in big tonal shifts\nbetween some of the chap-ters, and the occasional\nclumsy sentence structure and erroneous use of\npunctuation. While the\nindividual authors are not\nprofessional writers and\ncan\u2019t be expected to produce a perfect work of literature, there are several\noversights on the part of the editors which sometimes interrupt the flow of reading, and, while not\nnecessarily a major issue, can be irksome. The emphasis on the fact that \u201cnot all research happens in a\nlab\u201d, omnipresent in the introduction and the book\ndescription, also reads as a bit dismissive of studies\nthat do necessitate lab work, although this attitude\nis fortunately not present in any of the chapters.\nOverall, however, ResearcHER manages to do\nwhat it sets out to do: prove that anyone can be-comearesearcher,regardlessoftheircircumstances,\nand that diversity in research is crucial in providing\nnew ideas and avenues of thought. As a woman in\nSTEM and an aspiring researcher myself, some of\nthe experiences portrayed resonate with me deeply \u2013 be it that of a biologist who is also passionate\nabout history and culture in her spare time, or that\nof an immigrant woman enduring culture shock as\nshe transitions between education systems upon\nmoving to the UK as a teenager. With the variety of\nidentities and backgrounds of the researchers that have\nwritten for this anthology, any reader will be able to\nfind a story or experience to relate to. If you have any\nschool-age female relatives considering a career in re-search, this might just be the read for them.\n\u201c\nSOME OF THE\nEXPERIENCES\nPORTRAYED\nRESONATE WITH\nME DEEPLY\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n18\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nBOOKS\n\n"

That\u2019s not bad, take it from\nme.\nI went to one of their free events (of which there are\nquite a few), called \u2018Creative Future Writers\u2019 Day\u2019. This\nevent involved a series of talks and discussion panels in\nthe Purcell Room at Southbank Centre, along with an\nexhibition of literary organisations, publishers, and societies set up in the foyer just outside. It was a fantastic\nexperience. Being able to hear first-hand advice from\npeople who know the industry inside out was something I\u2019d never dreamed of being able to do. Looking\nback over my eight pages of notes, I\nhave to highlight the insights into\nindie presses that the speaker from\nOut-Spoken Press, Anthony Anaxagorou, shared with us.\nAnaxagorou painted a vivid picture of a one-and-a-half-person team\nsoenthusedbytheirloveofwordsand\nlanguage that they work at all hours to get poetry that\ndeserves to be seen, published. There are people who\nopen their emails in the morning looking for \u2018fresh,\nunique voices\u2019 and poetry \u2018they couldn\u2019t live without\u2019.\nIs that how you feel when you wake up? If so, then this\nmight just be the career for you.\nThe audience broke into applause by the end of his speech,\nso infectious was his energy. The\nwonderful dynamic between the\npanellists continued throughout\nthe day. Everyone kept running\novertime, and the quality of answers to questions from the audience was brilliant as well.\nHowever, unfortunately the\nprogramme was better than the re-ality: the Director of Faber Academy had tonsilitis and the absence of the Associate\nEditor of Dialogue Books wasn\u2019t even mentioned. In\ncase that doesn\u2019t mean much to you: Faber Academy is\noneofthebettercreativewritingschools,andDialogue\nBookshasjustbecomepartofHachette,oneofthe\u2018Big\nFive\u2019 in the publishing industry.\nI learnt about the distinctions between pamphlets,\ncollections, and anthologies, shared a room with Joelle Taylor, the 2021 winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize for\nPoetry, and accumulated an\ninfinite number of free poetry booklets. I was also introduced to this quote from\nRobert Graves: \u2018there\u2019s no\nmoney in poetry, but then\nthere\u2019s no poetry in money,\neither.\u2019\nYou could hear the appreciation in the applause when the day finally wrapped\nup. Many people in the audience had experienced getting their work rejected, but today had been treated\nwith consideration by experts in their field.\nIf you are reading this and even vaguely interested\nin what advice was given, here are three of the top tips\nI gathered:\nAnd poets! Submit to indie presses, go to Open Mic\nnights, get involved in the scene, join Poetry Society!\nI did temporarily, before I found out there\u2019s a Writer\u2019s\nSociety at Imperial, so here\u2019s some free advertisement\nfor them.\nI think it\u2019s appropriate to mention here that Imperial,STEM-orientatedthoughitis,hasatleasttwomajor\nconnections to the creative world: the first ever Queen\nperformance happened here (Brian May studied Maths\nand Physics) and when Imperial was still the \u2018Normal\nSchool of Science\u2019, H.G.

    "content": "Where there is life, there is death.\nIn my view, modern societies\nare living without thinking carefully\nabout how they spend their time. The\namount of time we spend doing things\nwe do not like but are forced to, or\nover-thinking about elements outside\nof our control is unimaginable. People\nlive their lives as if they are immortals,\nforgetting that their time is limited.\nDeath is the end of all biological\nfunctions, e.g reproduction, nutrition\nand relation, forever. In the case of a\nbacterium, death is when that single\ncell dies. In our case, as multicellular\norganisms, it is defined as brain death -if you lose an arm, but your brain keeps\nfunctioning, it is not considered death.\nBraindeathmeansthatallmemoriesand\nskillsyouhaveobtainedthroughoutyour\nlife will be gone forever; not only will all\nthe sadness and sorrow, but also joy and\nlove will be gone forever. Your body will\nnever move again and just be an empty\nshell. Death is the utmost expression of\nindifference towards the environment,\nof complete stillness and emptiness.\nIt has become increasingly normalised\nto say things like \u201cI will be looking at\nInstagram for 10 min while commuting\u201d.\nThe phrase \u201cI am just gonna kill some\ntime\u201d has become alarmingly innocent\nand innocuous. We spend countless\nhours going from one YouTube video\nto another only to emerge having learnt\nnothing, gained nothing and having had\nno meaningful experiences. We have a\nmentality of brainlessly wasting time\nin anticipation of something new. We\nspend copious amounts of energy on\nirrelevant things like Instagram just to\n\u201cpass time\u201d, even though we will forget\nthese useless activities instantaneously.\nWhy do most people love scrolling\nthrough social media or watching\nYouTube? Because it is simultaneously\neffortless but stimulating. The human\nbrain is designed to remember the\nactivities that were challenging for itself,\nthose that require you to push yourself\nto your limits. Instagram is just scrolling\ndown the screen, occasionally giving\na \u201cLike\u201d here and there. It requires\nno degree of effort, but it gives you\nenough little bursts of dopamine and\nserotonin for you to get addicted.\nWe don\u2019t get paid for using social\nmedia, but can for writing a book,\ndeveloping a new cure for diabetes,\namong other achievements. Our society\nrewards people who do hard things\nbecause not everyone is willing, or able\nto sacrifice instant gratification for long-term reward. You could easily spend\nyour \u201cInstagram\u201d time reading a book\ninstead, increasing your intrinsic value,\nor having quality time with your family,\nbringing more authentic joy. The list of\nmeaningless things we do every day is\nalmost infinite: Instagram, YouTube,\nsmall talk, video games, TikTok, etc.\nHowever, some of these activities are\nuseful when done so in moderation.\nYou can learn a lot from YouTube\nprovided that you choose informative\nchannels such as Kurzgesagt, and small\ntalk is essential for bonding. I am not\nin favour of being ultra-productive all\nthe time - there will be times that you\nwill just want to watch some Netflix\non the couch. What I am against is\nthe systematic way we waste our time\nwithout even realising almost every day.\nIthinkoneofthemainreasonspeople\nspend their time so carelessly is the lack\nofawarenessoftheinevitabilityofdeath.\nThe general population avoids thinking\nabout death because they are afraid of\ndying - who isn\u2019t? They usually make\nexcuses such as \u201cIt is too far away,\u201d or \u201cI\nam still young\u201d. However, they do not\nrealise that our bodies are in a process\nof constant degeneration. Our hearts,\nmuscles, brain, etc. are deteriorating\nNOW, not just 40 years later. Each\nday, a new cancer cell appears in your\nbody and the risk of that cancer cell\nbecoming a life-threatening disease\nincreases exponentially with your age.\nYou have a 50% chance of getting cancer\nat some point in your life. Another\nfact to remember is that people live an\naverage of around 80 years in developed\ncountries. Therefore, if you are 20 years\nold, you have already lived a quarter of\nyour life. Well, you can still say that you\nhave 60 years more! But that is tricky\nbecause the quality of life of your last\n20 years will probably not be the best.\nChronic diseases will emerge rampantly.\nOne in three people older than 65 years\nhave diabetes. Mobility restrictions will\nbe common. Heat stroke during the\nsummer days will be a serious threat. You\nwould no longer be able to eat whatever\nyou want. Therefore, in reality, you\nonly have 40 years of good health left.\nSome people still stay in good health\nin their 60s, 70s and even 80s, but if\nyou go to the statistics, the majority\nwill suffer from chronic diseases and\ngeneral body degeneration. Therefore,\nare you going to spend that time with\npeople that you do not care about\non social media or would you build\nmeaningful relationships and work\nhard on your life objectives? The clock\nis running unstoppably. Now, it is your\nturn to move. Do not waste your time.\nFRIDAY, 28TH OCTOBER 2022\n5\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe Kill-Some-Time Culture\nWang Guo Science Writer\nComment\nCredit: Envato Elements\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"

Professor\nFoley, who studies and advises on\nrenewable and sustainable energy, has\nestimated that an average household\ncould save \u00a31.20 on electricity per day\nunder DST. While less artificial light\nwould need to be used for working in\nthe afternoon, there would also be less\nneed for heating, as buildings would\nstart to lose the sun\u2019s heat later in the day\ntoo. The same energy savings that would\nreduce a household\u2019s bills would also\nresult in lower carbon emissions from\nthose providers still operating with coal-based power. However, this proposal has\nbeen brought to Parliament and rejected\nmany times before, so it is unlikely\nthat it will get passed any time soon,\nparticularly in the country\u2019s current\npolitical state (we have yet to see what\nRishi Sunak has in store for the UK\u2019s\nclimate and environmental policies).\nOntario, Canada was the first place in\ntheworldtoadopttheDSTin1908,and\nisnowoneofthefirststatesinCanadato\nmove towards permanent DST. Iceland\nadopted permanent DST in 1968, as the\nextreme difference between summer and\nwinter daytime renders daylight saving\nslightly nonsensical. The European\nUnion and the US have both considered\nremaining on DST in the last few years,\nbut neither has fully halted the turning\nback of the clocks yet. A major factor in\nthis is the vast range of the two regions,\nand discrepancies in the preferences of\ntheir constituent states or countries.\nSimilarly to Scotland, most Northern\nregions are opposed to constantly being\nan hour ahead, while Southern areas\ntend to be more amenable to the idea.\nEitherway,itdoesnotappeartobeatthe\nforefront of anyone\u2019s current political\nagenda.\nIf DST were to be implemented\npermanently, it is estimated that less\nenergy would be used for light and\nheating during the day, leading to lower\nhousehold costs and environmental\nimpact. The change in time zone has\nbeen associated with a spike in physical\nand mental health issues, such as heart\nattacks, strokes,\nseasonal depression, and circadian\nrhythm disruption. As discussed above,\nthere is also a link to lower rates of road\naccidents, particularly in the evening\nrush hour. Furthermore, arguably more\nwork is now done during the afternoon\nand evening, at least in the corporate\nsector, and it would be beneficial to have\nmore daylight in that period of time.\nOn the other hand, jobs that begin\noperating earlier in the morning, like\nfarmers and rail workers, as well as\npeople driving in the morning, could\nsuffer from having the sun rise later\u2014\nthere would then be an unfair negative\nimpact on blue collar jobs. There is also\nthe consideration that children would\nspend more of their morning travel\nand lessons in darkness\u2014 although this\ncouldberemediedbyalsoshiftingschool\nhours forwards throughout the year.\nPeople living in the north of the country\nwould also be more disadvantaged by\nthe transition than others.\nI am only the most recent in a long\nline of people who have written about\nwhether or not our country and others\nshould remain on DST year-round. It\u2019s\nsurprising how seemingly mundane\nmatters can have such an impact as to\nbe continually discussed and revisited,\nbut every year the question comes back\nround with the changing of the clocks.\nWho knows whether a policy change\nwill ever be implemented in our future,\namong all the other policies being\nconsidered, but at least you now have\nthepowertolectureyourflatmateonthe\npros and cons of changing our time zone\nevery six months!\nENVIRONMENT\nWhat YOU can\ndo about the\nclimate crisis\nBy the end of this century, more than\na quarter of the population could\nbe living in places where the average\ntemperature is 29\u00b0C, which today only\nscorches the Sahara. Farming in these regions would be impossible, forcing one\nbillion people living in rural regions to\nmigrate. Due to resource constraints,\nthose still living in cooler climates might\nbe forced to close their borders, potentially resulting in conflicts. Thankfully,\nthere is still time to turn things around.\nThe media suggests you can combat\nthe climate crisis by donating to chari-ties, joining climate rallies, and reducing your carbon footprint. Whilst these\nhelp, this one-size-fits-all advice wastes\nthe individual\u2019s unique talents; We need\npeople with very different skillsets to attack this crisis from all angles: research-ers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, teach-ers, journalists, community organizers\nandactivists.InherTEDTalk,Elizabeth\nAyana Johnson suggests that, to find our\nrole, we each should create a Venn diagram with three circles for three ques-tions: \u2018what needs doing?\u2019, \u2018what brings\nyou joy?\u2019 and \u2018what skills do you have?\u2019.\nThe aim is to then spend as much time\ndoing things that are at the intersection\nof these 3 cir-cles; note\nt h a t\nthese\nc a n\nb e\ntime\nspent\na t\nw o r k\nCharlie Lindsay Environment Writer\n11%\nThe decrease in\nthe number of\npeople involved\nin serious accidents during the\nthree year experiment\n\n"

The remainder of this article aims to help you answer these three questions in the context of combatting climate change.\nNow, imagine a doughnut; this is not\nthe sugary kind, but instead a diagram\ncreated by economist Kate Raworth\nto illustrate an answer to \u2018what needs\ndoing?\u2019. Raworth states that \u2018we must\nstrive to meet the needs of all people (be\nabove the doughnut\u2019s inner ring) whilst\nstaying within the planet\u2019s 9 ecological\nboundaries (be within the doughnut\u2019s\nouter ring)\u2019. To exist in the sweet spot of\nthe doughnut, there are many possible\nstrategies like implementing carbon-free\nenergy solutions and restoring biodiver-sity. However, one overlooked strategy\nis stabilizing the global population;\nperhaps the most effective way to\ndo this is through empowering\nwomen. In Sir David Attenborough\u2019s \u2018A Life on Our Planet\u2019,\nhe states that \u2019wherever women\nhave the vote, wherever girls\nstay in school for longer and\nwherever women have access\nto good healthcare and con-traception, the birth rate falls.\u2019\nThis is because when women gain\nfreedom of choice, they choose\nto have fewer children. Austria\u2019s\nWittgenstein Centre found that if\nthe education systems of the poorest countries improved as quickly this\ncentury as the richest countries did last\ncentury, we would reduce the forecasted\npeak human population from 11 to 9\nbillion! Fewer people mean less carbon\nemissions and in improving education,\nweworktowardscreatingasafe\nand just future for all;\nwe move closer into\nthe doughnut on\nboth fronts.\nThere are\ntherefore\nincredible reasons to\nbe ex-trin-sica l- l y\nm o t i v a t - e d\nto act, but often the main barrier is a lack of intrinsic motivation.\nAs combatting the climate crisis is a\nmarathon, not a sprint, it\u2019s important\nto fill your time doing things which intrinsically motivate you and bring you\njoy, or more specifically, \u2018flow\u2019. In his\nbook, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines\n\u2018flow\u2019 as \u2018a state in which people are so\ninvolved in an activity that nothing else\nseems to matter\u2019. The experience itself is\nso enjoyable that you do it for the sheer\nsake of doing it, even without the benefits of money, praise or recognition.\nCsikszentmihalyi conducted over 8,000\ninterviews and found five components\nwhich contribute to a flow experience:\n1: At every moment,\nyou have a clear goal.\n2: There is regular feedback as to how\nwellyouareprogressingtowardsthisgoal.\n3: Your skill level matches that required by the challenge.\n4:Yourattentionissingularlyfocused.\n5: You stop being self- conscious.\nIf you are yet to find a\n\u2018flow\u2019 activity, consider learning a new\nskill which incorporates\nthese five\ncomponents ;\nif you\nh a v e\nfound\ns u c h\na n\na c - tivity, ask\nyourself how the activity itself or\nthe skills gained from it can be applied to tackling the climate crisis.\nPerhaps it is therefore better to rephrase \u2018what skills do you have?\u2019 to\n\u2018what skills could you have after leaving\nImperial?\u2019. Firstly, these may be entrepreneurial skills like business management;\nAttenborough hopes for a sustainable\nrevolution in which innovators create\nproducts that reduce our impact on the\nplanet. A new society called Climate\nEntrepreneurs has been created to help\ninspire new ideas and connect you with\nsustainable start-ups. Imperial\u2019s Enterprise Lab also hosts the Venture Catalyst Challenge, which can help fund\nyour ideas. A previous winner is SaltyCo, who create biodegradable and\ncarbon-neutral textiles as an alternative to the norm, which uses up\nvast amounts of land and creates\nswathesofplasticpollution.Sec-ondly, these could be skills of\nlifelong importance like critical\nthinking and communication,\nwhich could be improved by\njoining societies like Debating\nand Model United Nations.\nLastly, these may be skills you\ngain from your degree; A mechanical engineer could design affordable heat pumps, a materials\nscientist might create a low-carbon\nalternative to concrete and an electrical engineer could implement micro-grids for renewable energy production.\nThe average person spends 80,000\nhours working; if you can fill this time\ndoingactivitieswhichareattheintersec-tion of the Venn diagram, which simultaneously moves us closer into the sweet\nspot of the doughnut, brings you joy,\nand matches your skills, you could massively help to avert a climate catastro-phe.

Of course, that\u2019s fine if that\u2019s what\nyou\u2019re like, but a lot about going to university and getting degrees is just about perseverance, rather than per-sonality. Passion and real interest also factor in a lot,\ne.g., if you\u2019re interested in performing arts you can do a\ndoctorate in that and become a lecturer or do research\nin it. It\u2019s a lot about tapping into people\u2019s interests, and\nsocial media has really helped with that.\nYoumentionedperformingarts;isthebook\nfocused on STEM careers or is it a wider\nrange of subjects?\nNo, it\u2019s definitely not focused on STEM, there are\nsome STEM researchers in there but Dr. Allison Upshaw, one of the chapter contributors, whose research\nis arts-based, is also a fantastic opera singer, so it presents a whole range of things.\nDo you read much in your spare time?\nThat\u2019s one of the stereotypes of people who do well\nacademically, but I don\u2019t really read. I\u2019m not the kind\nof person to pick up a novel. When I do read it\u2019s usually for information \u2013 when I was really young, I liked\nlooking at encyclopaedias, and looking online for\ninformation, but I don\u2019t read for pleasure \u2013 I do binge-watch shows on Netflix! It\u2019s one of those stereotypes\nthat people think we live in libraries and have books\nall over the place. I don\u2019t even particularly like writing,\nwhich is why I did arts-based research \u2013 I made a film\n\u2013 but I did have to do some writing about it too.\nWhat was the process of publishing the\nbook\u2013wasitinternalordidyousenditout\nto publishers?\nIt was a very quick turnaround. We were lucky that\nWomen in Academia Support Network was selected\nby Facebook for a prestigious global community ac-celerator. We have a Facebook group that many of our\nmembers engage with, and we were one of only ten\ncharities in the UK that got chosen, and about for-ty-four worldwide. That entailed getting some money\nand professional development for wider projects, and\nwe were thinking about what we could do as a group\nof academics. We said, well, we write, don\u2019t we, and we\nwant to get our research out into the world.\nWe\u2019d already been working very closely with a publishing house called Emerald Global Publishing, who\npublish academic journal writing, and many of us already had articles\npublished with\nthem. We knew a\npublisher, had a\ngroup of people\nwho write and research for a living,\nwe thought, let\u2019s do\na book! Emerald\nhad never done anything like this be-fore, because it\u2019s a\ncomplete departure from just putting research in jour-nals. We were very grateful they got on board, because\nwe were able to have a fast turnaround, so the book was\nproduced in just six weeks. That included getting chapter authors to contribute, writing the foreword and in-troduction,gettingamazingillustrations,andgettingit\ninto print. We were so over the moon with the illustra-tions. That was such a brilliant day, when those images\ncame through.\nWith the funding we then bought back a thousand\ncopies from Emerald, and we\u2019re currently distributing\nthose for free through a network of institutions to be\ndistributed more widely by participation teams, who\nknow their local areas better and know which groups\nof young people would benefit most from reading it.\nI\u2019m in the middle of getting prices for shipping books\nout because we\u2019ve got some going out to places like\nSouth Africa, India, Australia, and also around the\nUK. We\u2019re really pleased that people will get to read\nthese books for free. They are for sale as well, and we\u2019re\nencouraging universities, schools and colleges to buy\nsome copies for their libraries. For the general public,\nthey make a lovely gift \u2013 I\u2019ve gifted some to young people who I know would enjoy reading them, for long\nholiday journeys like Manchester to Cornwall in the\ncar. Getting some copies out for free was a big part of\nthe funding drive.\nYou said you went to the Open University\nfor your bachelor\u2019s degree, where did you go\nafter that?\nAs I said, I sat my finals two weeks before my son\nwas born, so I didn\u2019t get to go to graduation. I never\nstepped foot in a university building apart from sitting\nsome exams, but I did my final exams at home with a\nhuge belly. Two or three years later I did a master\u2019s in\nInclusive Education and Special Educational Needs\nat Manchester Metropolitan University, and being\nme, managed to complete it earlier than I should have\nbecause it was another part time course. I was at home\nwith two under two, and I was working, but I got a\ndistinction, and that enabled me to get a PhD scholarship at the University of Manchester.\nThere I researched: \u2018Why are mathematically demanding careers like the sciences and engineering seen\nas being for particular kinds of people, and so stereotyped?\u2019. I got a load of people who did those kinds of\ndemanding courses, like chemical engineers, maths\nteachers, quantity researchers, to do improvisational\ndrama about their experiences with maths, and filmed\nthat and made a documentary. I absolutely loved that;\nwhen you start a PhD you write a proposal saying what\nyou think your research is going to be, and by the end\nof the first year I realised I wanted to do arts based. Often when we research subjects like maths or sciences,\nwe concentrate on why people aren\u2019t good at it or why\nthey don\u2019t enjoy it, but we can learn just as much from\npeople who succeed in it.\nThe stories that came out from the participants who\nhad gone into careers in maths or hard sciences were\nthat they tended to have the same struggles as everyone else \u2013 not really enjoying it or finding it difficult.\nThere were two participants who were in lower sets for\nmaths at school, but managed to work their way up by\nasking questions and doing extra homework. Sometimes it just takes age and maturity to figure out how\nthings work. It was really enjoyable, especially to bust\nthat stereotype that people in those careers are quiet,\nshy, socially awkward. I met one of my participants at a\ndrama group, we were both looking into science com\u201c\nTHE BOOK WAS\nPRODUCED\nIN JUST SIX\nWEEKS\n\u201c\nWE CONCENTRATE ON\nWHY PEOPLE AREN\u2019T\nGOOD AT [STEM] OR WHY\nTHEY DON\u2019T ENJOY IT, BUT\nWE CAN LEARN JUST AS\nMUCH FROM PEOPLE WHO\nSUCCEED IN IT\nCredit: Envato Elements\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n20\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Their debut album, Whatever People\nSay, That\u2019s What I\u2019m Not (2006) defined British garage rock from the noughties, checking all the relevant\nboxes: gritty, disillusioned teenage rants, Strokes and\nLibertines-inspired post-punk revival riffs, danceable\nhits that can find homes in indie clubs, and the unmistakable Northern accent that the group made the executive decision to retain. This was the band that\nachieved internet fame in 2006 having circulated\na few free CD demos literally \u201cbeneath a boardwalk\u201d,\nfinding their music skyrocketing to number one on\nUK charts. This was the band with Matt Helders,\nwho only took up the drums only because the\nrest of the band had picked up guitars.\nHowever, those who\nmatured along\nwith the band\nknow that with\neach consecutive album, the\noriginal punk rock angst of their\nsound was slowly being traded in for sounds\nwith a softer edge. The reverbed and ambient timbres\nheard in Humbug (2009) had a dark and almost sinister undertone that relied on orthogonal analogies,\ninstead of the on-the-nose narrative that separated\nthe band from other garage rock bands in the first\nplace. Although it didn\u2019t perform as well, Suck it and\nSee (2011) gave the band a chance to flirt with con-trastingly sweeter, guitar pop elements \u2013 airy, sparkly\nguitar with an understated bass line, and a version of\nlead singer, Alex Turner, that was very sing-alonga-ble. AM (2013) reserved some of that romance for\nsome sultry, soft rock numbers, while cashing in on\nTurner\u2019s distinctive brand of nonchalant seductive-ness and dialling down Helders\u2019 inventive drumming.\nWith the occasional heart-in-my-hands poet-ry, the Arctic Monkeys discography took a detour\nupon the arrival of Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino\n(2018) \u2013 a space, lounge concept album with an instrument no one thought to hear on an Arctic Monkeys record \u2013 a piano. Turner experimented with\nBowie-influenced voice modulation in vocals that\nclung loosely to the album\u2019s tonal backgroud. It is\nthis jazz-tinged and instrument-heavy sound that\nthe Arctic Monkeys have brought forth to their\nseventh, and most recent studio album \u2013 The Car.\nThe album opens on the first single released by the\nband, \u2018There\u2019d Better Be a Mirrorball\u2019, immediately setting the tone for the rest of the album. A blossom of\nominous string arrangments means the band definitely\npursued the path their previous album took \u2013 an exception to which would be \u2018Sculptures of Anything Goes\u2019\nwhose haunting 80s synth sound can be attributed to\nguitarist,JamieCook,puttingadrummachinethrough\naMoogsynthesiser.Nottomention,theoccasionalgui-tar twangs throughout the album that give it a mature,\nyet funky touch. But orchestras introduce dynamic, in\na controlled and sophisticated way \u2013 a way that was\nmodestly explored in Turner\u2019s other band with Miles\nKane, the Last Shadow Puppets, in their last album,\nEverythingYou\u2019veCometoExpect(2016).Although,the\nband occupies more of the spotlight in this album than\nin its predecessor, I would agree that criticism\nfor Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino still stands:\nTurner\u2019s vision for an album still reigns supreme over this record, for better or for worse.\nTurner\u2019s voice has grown more depth \u2013\nnot deeper, just depth. Listening to Arctic\nMonkeys is\nalways an exercise in trying to understand what about Turner\u2019s\nvoice is so incredibly appealing on this record. Is it\nthe seductive eyebrow-raise in a leather jacket in AM\nor the crooning meanders of Tranquility Base Hotel\nand Casino? Turner uses this album, instead, to propound his falsetto, especially in \u2018Body Paint\u2019, while\ntrying a raspier, whispy sound in the album\u2019s second\nsingle, \u2018I Ain\u2019t Quite Where I Think I Am\u2019. Much like\nhis live performances (even of old material), Turner\u2019s\njazz-inspired vocals hang tenuously from the frame\nof these orchestral symphonies, because, after all,\nthe focus of the album has succesfully shifted to the\ninstrumentals more than his (still seductive) voice.\nTonally, this album signals a complete departure from\ntheir youthful unrest that translated into sharp guitar\nriffs and frenzied rhythms.\nTurner has stopped sounding\nlike the cocky try-hard he was\nbeginning to impersonate in\n2013, around the release of\nAM, and has certainly moved\npast describing indie club\nbouncers and underage drinking in a fraught, yet blas\u00e9 voice from 2006. The album-openerthistimeisnostalgicallyromantic\u2013evenif\nit may be about love past its prime, the romance comes\nmore from the simple pendulum of synth and string\nthat backdrops Turner\u2019s voice. He sings about the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with\nbeing a middle-aged rocker\nwith a reputation he simply\ncannot live up to anymore\nin \u2018Big Ideas\u2019 This album is\nthe big idea he enticed the\nband with, but now that he\nstands with the orchestra at\nhis disposal, the excitement\nis replaced by consternation.\nEven through interviews,\nthe band has drawn tenuous\ncomparisons to songs from\nThe Car to those from AM,\nd e s p i t e the differences in their styles\ngreatly outperforming the similaries. And isn\u2019t that\nthe whole point? The instruments on the album soak\nup the band\u2019s tonal shift without hesitation, even if\nTurner and the rest of the band might take a moment\u2019s\nthought before accepting the same. Despite this, the album definitely takes a more honest look at where the\nband are right now, both sonically as well as in their\nlives, never looking at events \u2013 only at the emotion.\n\n"
