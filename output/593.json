    "content": "Deal Mark\n' \" The majority ol socialists\narc not pow ei crazed dictators\nin the making\". So wrote Robert Kclsev in FELIX592 in his letter defending social-ism. The obvious implication ol this statement is that a minority ol socialists are pow crc r axed dictators in lite making. It is all too obvious from his\nspeeches that Tony Benn( formerly Viscount Stansgalc)\nTails into this latter category.!\nMr Kelsey continued his\nletter b v saving,( j nite rightly, that Russia is not a socialist\nstate. But if Tony Benn and his friends seize power in this\ncountry then wc will, as he\nhas stated on numerous occasions, turn our nation into a country run very much on Russian lines, il not b v Russia herself. Mr Benn has\nmade it quite clear that lie\nwould national is e all major industries in this country and many minor ones as well. He has said that .the ' media is\nbiased against socialism and a socialist government would therefore have to 'rectify' the\nimbalance. The means by\nwhich Benn would do this I leave to the readers' i mag in a tion.) He has said that the\nsocialist members of par lia ment would be accountable to\nthe National Executive Com*mit t ce( i.e. Politburo) ol the\nLabour Party and mil to their\nconstituencies who elected them: this incidentally is a. flagrant breach with the principles of the English Revolution which Mr Benn is.\nso fond of quoting at us. Mr Benn has said that the police\nwould be made' more accountable' to the community whatever l/ ml ma v mean: by\ngaining control ol i he police\nlone, which is what Benn means, a Benn government\nwould have the ability lo\ncontrol the state and suppress\nthose individuals who weir so\n\"anti-social' as in resist Ins\nregime. I could ra it\\ on Ibe\nlist of things which Benn has\nannounced thai he would do\nbill this would become tedious, and I think thai I lie\nabove examples arc sull ic lent\nin show i hat he does want io\nsei up a So viel \u00ab.i> le sl alc in\nthis cot mtr v. One must not, as Robert Kelsey appears lo do. believe\ni he rhetoric or freedom w lii eh Benn preaches | Lenin did the\nsame On ennis i exercise independent critical judge-ment of the motives of people\nsuch as Benn. It is a pity that\nmany people are so intoxicated by the philosophy of power that Benn preaches that they\ncannot see what their actions\nwill ultimately lead to. The Labour Party is not to be\ntrusted.\nTours sincerely\nFrank James Dear Sir\nI thought you might like to\nin form your readers ol some ol\nthe great video cas se11es we have available to view in\nthe library on Level4( West),\nmost of our collection ol tapes\n(some 80+) are on course related topics, but the following\nmight be ol general interest\ntoo: ( Health and Safety) Vis i ble Display Units \u2014 A Doctor's view\";( Careers) YVe have 1 1\ncareers tapes from companies ranging from Shell to British\nRail and also some Civil Service careers tapes; ( Com put ing) Lots ol computing tapes\nincluding our own rer r interesting\" Office of the Professional\".

As we agree with the general\ntone of the letter, we will take\nthe reference to our esteemed\norganisation as a humorous aside, and take no further\naction against Mr/ Mrs/ Miss Ms J. Hol lier, ignoring the\ncouple of unfortunate phrases\nincluded. Meanwhile we would like\nto take this opportunity to\nwelcome fresher s to this wonderful College; now you' ve looked around and I bund how boring this place is\n(and how boring most of you are) perhaps you are wondering how to liven things up a bit. To set the scene H44HS is\nnot so much a College club( we prefer to operate outside\nthe system), as a movement, especially at this time to guide\nyoung lost souls floundering in their newfound freedom.\nMention has already been\nmade of our lighter side, but\nwe are more serious, though this is generally seen by others\nas a policy of creating as\nmuch havoc and disorder and rebelling against our superiors\nas possible. However these\npeople do not appreciate the\ndeeper social meaning ol our act ions.\nThus our message to you. young adventurous bored fresher with pent up frustrations (and too many clich es) is\nhave a good time. Fk the\nCC Us, nick a mascot, if you can( that'll bugger ' cm;, or\nsomething smaller( e. g.B McCabe and give him to\nanother college) if you can't, bill please, please do some-thing.

Twice, in your most\nrecent issue we were criticized unjustly.\nFirstly. SF Soc ALIEN at cd' your readers by claiming th a tEXTS were charging exorbitant fees for hire of\nprojectors. This is not the case. for. approximately50% ol the charge is a refundable deposit to ensure that( as\nhappened last year) the projectors are not u nrc mitla bly damaged. We do not\nsuggest for a moment that SF Soc is responsible for this but\nhow can we charge one society without charging another? Of course we would not have based these charges\nwithout complete Union approval. Why should ENTS deprive anyone( including ourselves) of showing films\nwithout some form of cover.\nSecondly, why did your( unnamed) reviewer make the\nabsurd claim that we were no l represented at the fresher s'C CU party when the acting I CENTS Officer was responsible for booking the band and ensured the smooth running of the event? Other EXT S committee members were employed both at the\nfilm and selling tickets for the\nfresher s' concert at the time.\n1 ours\nPaul Beli or d Page 2 FELIX, October 23, 1981\n\n"

Good work in mid lie ld by\nDolan on the left and Kindred and McMahon in more central positions resulted\nin i he forwards getting good service. Many chances were wasted before a line cross from\nthe right by Kindred was met at the near post\nby Savage, who scored with a header.\nThirty or so corners won by the\nFourths and good efforts by McNicholas,\nBurns and Savage failed to add to the score.\nSuch a one-sided match, RH C had a single\nshot, should have resulted in a larger margin\nof victory, but IC had to be content with\ntheir solitary goal.\nTeam: Slater, Burns, Chown, Burden, Ataddr,\nMcMahon, Kindred, Dolan, McYicholax, Savage,\nHeath.\nFifths\nOn Wednesday at Harlington the Fifths, last\nyear's league and cup winners, opened their\nleague programme with an excellent win\nover Royal Holloway Seconds.\nThe Fifths began in grand style and Keith\nChamberlain was unlucky to see his well-taken shot rebound oil the Holloway bar.\nThe Fifths had several more efforts, before\nDave Stephenson gave them Ihe lead with a well-taken header from a Bob Dhillon cross.\nThe score remained 1-0 until hall-time with\nthe IC defence of Nigel Aud in, Satish Kiel, Dave Rogers and Mark Haberlin dealing\ncapably w ith a very skilful Holloway forward\nline, and Neil Hampton in goal dealt\nbrilliantly with anything that did get through\nthe defence.\nAlter hall-time Holloway were lucky to\nget a highly dubious equalise r, but far from\nde moral ising the Filths this was the signal lor\neven greater ell br t from them. Now wave upon\nwave of attacks were launched on the\nHolloway goal as IC sought their rightful\nlead. Inevitably alter some miraculous escapes around the Holloway goal mouth the\ngoal came: Dave Wadsworth opened up\nHolloway on the right side and crossed to\nBob Dhillon who saw his first shot parried by\nthe keeper, but his lightning reflexes enabled\nhim to plant the rebound in the roof ol the\nHolloway net. Further trouble was to befall\nHolloway as Nick Gas kill opened up\nHolloway's defence and sent a rasping shot\ninto the top corner of the net.\nShortly alter this Holloway managed a second goal. But IC immediately retook\ncommand with Steve Coussens. once again\nghosting past his fullback lo open up\nHolloway's by now beleaguered defence.\nThe final whistle signalled yet another\nline team performance by IC: Filth s.

The team consisted of no less\nthan eight fresher s and against a fit.\nexperienced ' D' Division, it did not take 10\nlong to establish a stamp of authority over\ntheir opponents. Instrumental in the control\nof the game was Steve Thompson, a centre\nplaying ll y half, who showed a cool head in\nall situations. Il was he. linking so well with\nJose Paxaio who initiated back moves which\ncreated tries for Owen Miles (1) and Dick\nDowns (2). two wingers putting forward\ncreditable performances.

    "content": "CLUBS AND SOCIETIES;\nBoardsailing\nEarly last \" Saturday morning, a group of\ndrowsy students gathered outside Southside,\naround a bedraggled mini which was laden\nwith a wind surfboard. Yes, these were some\nenthusiastic members of the board sailing club.\nA quick drive down the M4 took us to the lake,\nwhere the three 'experienced' board sail ers went to don wetsuits, whilst the two others\njoined the five hour beginners course. The\nfirst two hours were spent standing on dry land\nin the pouring rain by a board simulator,\nlearning the basic skills of sailing and turning.\nOccasional jogs delayed hypothermia setting\nin. \u2022\nAt lunchtime we invaded the local pub and\nhogged the log fire in an attempt to warm up.\nSomehow we all managed to force ourselves\nback into the cold rain, back to the lake. The\nbeginners crowded into the communal lorry to\nbe fitted up with wet suits. We all then took\nour boards and sails and paddled them out to:\nattach them to some buoys whilst we rigged\nand practiced our skills. Falling in was agony\nand the skill of getting out of the water as\nquickly as possible was developed rapidly:\nSoon all feeling had left feet and hands. Some\nof the more frozen beginners were taken by\nboat to land to have a reviving coffee before\nbeing let loose on the lake. Despite many\nsetbacks we all man ged to sail across the lake\nat least once, just enough to get us well and\ntruly addicted.\nBack on dry land dressing was difficult with\nnumb hands that refused to function. We then\noiled into the caravan for coffee and a talk on\nsafety precautions at sea. Then it was all over,\nback home to showers and baths to dream of\nnext week's attempt (that is if we haven't all\ncontracted pneumonia by then!).\nRebecca May( a 'hooked' beginner)\nSF Soc\nApologies first for Alien balls up. I trust you saw\nit last Tuesday instead, and 1 must repeat that\nit wasn't our fault (look out for Ridley Scott's new film next year Blade Runner, a film\nversion of Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream\nof Electric Sheep?). But first the news. From now on, SF Soc library meetings will be on\nThursdays( sametime) in the Green Committee Room on the top floor of the Union\nBuilding. Come and peruse our 450+ volumes\n(if you're a member that is). You may have\nnoticed that this week's bulletin is almost\nembarrassingly full of information. This is\nunavoidable I'm afraid, since now and then\nnews mounts up until nothing can be done to\nstave it off any longer. I would also like to\napologise for the informative nature of last\nweek's bulletin, but our kindly editor explained\nthe reasons for that in his editorial. So, now\nyou'll never know how to teach a rat not to\nread, how to generate power with vampires,\nand the mysterious link between B NFL and\nthe Church of Scotland.\nBut still in this weary world, where man is\nborn to trouble as the sparks fly upward, there\nis little to gain by speculation on what might\nhave been, and instead we must, as Walt\nWhitman advises, tuck our trousers into our\nsocks and have a good time. I will leave with\nsome food for thought for you all, in the first of\nour series, \"words I will remember\".\n\"I 've measured it from side to side\nIt's four feet long and two feet wide.\"\nW.

The venue was the Thames at\nHampton Court and after a fruitless wait at\nSouth Ken. for one or two members who\ndecided to remain in bed we finally began\nfishing at around 9:00am. The weather was\nnot, as Capital Radio had predicted, dry and\nsunny, but wet and miserable with occasional\nspells of extremely wet and miserable. This\nhowever did not detract from the sport and the\nfish were soon being reeled in. The best fish of\nthe day was a one pound c hub caught by Dave\nHardy on a swim feeder. Vic Butorijs and Van\nScott proved to be a formidable team, catching\nthirteen d ace, and a couple of roach between\nthem with Andy Chapman also catching a couple of d ace. All in all a successful day\nmarred only by the weather and the quality of\nthe Directors in the Prince of Wale s at\nHampton Court.\nThe next outing will be in about a fortnight's time, so if anybody is interested why not come\nalong to our Thursday night meetings which\ntake place at 6pm in Southside Bar or get in\ntouch with one of the following: Dave Kelsall,\nCE PG( Rm G10, CE) or John Davies, EE3.\nOSC\nThank you for making the fresher s' reception\nlast Wednesday such a big success. Next week\nthe OS C will hold two events you can't afford\nto miss.\nFirstly replacing our originally advertised\nfilm The Klansman we proudly present Where\nDoes It Hurt (Cert X) starring Peter Sellers in\nMech Eng 220 on Tuesday, October 27 at\n6:00pm. Tickets will be on a price differential\nbasis with6070 \u00b0o reductions for OS C members. Obviously it is highly advisable to\njoin the OS C or one of its nine national\nsocieties, you can join a club before the\nfilm show and make the most of the reduced\nrates for members!!!\n/ would like to take this opportunity to\nstress that the overseas students clubs are\nopen to all students and home students are\nmost welcome to join the clubs.\nSecondly, on Thursday, October 29 there\nwill be a talk on Asia and the Brandt Report in\nthe Read Lecture Theatre, Sherfield at 1:30pm to be given by Mr Qutbodin Aziz, Minister of\nInformation, Pakistan Embassy. As you may\nknow Pakistan withdrew from the Commonwealth and is not a member of the Lome\nConvention so this talk will certainly be super,\ndon't miss it for anything.\nMet & Mat Sci\nSoc\nGems, gems, gems.\nGeologists search for it, miners dig it up,\nbeautiful young ladies wear it, but what do\nmetallurgists and materials scientists do with\nit.\nFind out at the metallurgy and materials\nscience society's illuminating first evening\nlecture, on gemstones by Professor R.A.

    "content": "Cutting right down to the bone?\nA report on the College health service\nOur own health service consists of two full-time doctors, namely Dr Haines and Dr Addenbrooke. As well as these, there is Dr Gillan who\nshares his time between the health service and the Journal on Medical Ethics, which he edits. On the same terms as Dr Gillan there are two\nadditional doctors from a local general practice and also a psychiatrist\nwho works at the health service.\nAs well as students the service also caters for members of staff who\nregister there. Apart from providing medical attention to students, Dr Haines also serves on various committees such as the Safety Council\nand the Biological Safety Committee. According to Dr Haines it is\ngenerally an interest in younger age groups which draws doctors to\ncome and practise in college health services.\nOther special ser vies which our health service can oiler to students\ninclude advice on examination learning and counselling to students\nsul fe ring from stress, particularly near examination time.\nDue lo the very limited funds obtained from the NHS the service is\nvcr v heavily dependent on the University Chants Committee. As of\nyet. the cuts in expenditure have not afl ec led the health service but it\ndoes not seem that this state of all airs will las l very long. Dr Haines\nstated that at the present time he was involved in appealing against a refusal to allow him to provide unrestricted general medical services. If\nsuccessful this would provide additional funds. At the moment the\nhealth service receives a specific amount per studen i registered.\nII recent proposals under consideration by the Department ol Health\nare enforced, overseas students will lose their right to tree medical\ntreatment under the NHS. The XL'S are urging all overseas students\nbeginning their course this year to register with a doc tor al once to\nmake sure of free treatment. When asked about this new government\npolicy. Dr Haines remarked that il was very \"shortsighted\" of the\ngovernment to put up Ices and not account for the health service. He\nIC Radio\nImperial College Radio is the only student radio station in London, and\nbroadcasts on 301metres(999 kHz) medium wave to the Halls ot\nResidence round Princes Gardens. If you are interested in the station\nthen you are very welcome to drop into our main studios (beside the\nSouthside Shop, underneath the College end of Southside) at anytime\nduring lunchtimes or throughout the evening. If you would like to present\nprogrammes, you're especially welcome, and we'll show you how to use\nthe studio equipment and give you some advice on how to put a programme together. Another way to get involved is simply to phone in\nrequests, which we will try to play as soon as possible (usually within a very few minutes)\u2014so if you're in the Southside or Linstead Bar during\nthe evening dial 3440 on the internal phone for the music you want to\nhear.\nA typical weekday's programmes on IC Radio looks like this: 8:00-9:15am Breakfast programme, including cinema and gig guides,\ncompetitions, national and College news, and details of that day's College\nevents. 6:00pm Live From Six, with news of events happening in and\naround College, and entertainment and TV guides for that evening.\n8:00pm The Request Programme, this time of the evening is when we\nparticularly encourage listeners to ask for their favourite music on\ninternal 3440 (0-3440 from the Southside staircase phones). J0:00midnight The Late Late Late Late Early Show, some late night music and\na nightly competition (with records as prizes) and news and views from\naround College.\nThe schedule varies a bit on some nights of the week, and is very\ndifferent at weekends (for instance there's the Heavy Metal Show 'Scrap\nMetal' on Saturday evening), but in all our programmes we try to provide\nthe sort of radio station that students like to listen to: IC Radio is your\ntype of station\u2014why not tune in and prove it?\ncommented that the administration problem for the health service\nwould be immense, especially in terms ol collecting money or running\ninsurance schemes, and even under insurance schemes these would not\ncover free prescriptions or hospital treatment. As for the cost of\nprescriptions he cited a recent ease of a prescription for an overseas\nstuden i consisting of a one month's supply of 240 tablets costing the\nstudent \u00a350. Over a year this would come to \u00a3000. being the cost of\ntreatment for only one illness.\nWhen asked to comment on how lie could see the health service\ndeveloping in the light of recent cuts Dr Haines staled simply \"no way-will it expand\". The gloomy outlook however does not seem to have\ndampened his enthusiasm lo develop the service. In fact Dr Haines\nstated i hal lie would like to engage the services of a psychotherapist,\nthai is, someone who could provide a form of in-depth student\ncounselling.\nAsked whether in the light of a recent request made ol IC lo increase\nlis student numbers will the health service be expanding to\naccommodate for this change. Dr Haines commented dial he doubted\nwhether the UGC would provide funds for ibis and he- could no l realistically envisage an expansion. If the situation floes start to worsen\nrapidly, it will not be the students who will be- aliened li rsi. since the\nstall provide a form of buffer in that they w ill be the li rst patients to feel\nthe elicits of belt tightening.\nIl seems that the health service does have a great deal lo oiler\nstudents in u rms of direct medical advice as well as the not so direct\ncounselling services for examination worries, study stresses, etc.\nHowever it is clear thai the dependency of the funding of the service on\nthe UGC, coupled with the reduction in finances made available will\ninevitably take its toll and what is all too clear is that if this reduction\nin funds continues it is the student who will lose out eventually.\nOLD CENTRALIANS\nSir David Nicolson, M.E.P.

The game as a \"football spectacle\"\nwas quite unimpressive, IC obviously being\nin a generous mood and not scoring any ol a multitude of chances in the second half.\nFortunately, one or two incidents do stand\nout in the memory. Martin \"when I kick 'em,\nI don't hit ' em\" Curran did a commendable\nimpression of a pirouetting ballerina whilst\ntrying, unsuccessfully, to execute a volleyed\nclearance! Steve \"when I lay in front of'em,\nthey don't score\" Ward chose an opportune\nmoment to pray to Mecca and thus save the\nshortsighted Williams' blushes! Andy \"anyone want to buy a pair of second-hand\nhoots\" Page decided his feet were overheating\nand cooled them down by hall-ripping the\nsoles oil! But, the burning question left from\nthis match was: Why does Dave Dean always\nfall over when he shoots? Answers on a postcard to IC First XIco FELIX. Team: .1. Williams, M. Curran, S. Dunhill,\nA. Reeve, S. Ward, J. Lay, P..\\ic coll. s, A. Page,\n1). Dean. M. Can', G.

IC's early confidence was quickly\nrealised with M cP hail scoring two early\ngoals. Just after this however, despite trying\nto keep a \"low profile\" (his words, not mine),\nreferee Russ Gilbert (ex IC. now working),\ndecided to blow his whistle. While the IC\nplayers studied their' rule books to see if this\nwas allowed, Bedford scored (and the whistle\nblew again!!).\nThe second half saw a more determined\nattitude from IC and some moments ol\ninspired play led to two goals from Rim mer and one lor Philia s tides. Rim mer then\nproceeded to out jump a defence considerably\nbigger than his own garden gnome-sized\nIVame. to score the goal of the match, and\ncollect his hat-trick.\nBedford scored a consolation goal before\nHendy kicked the goalkeeper with some\nconsiderable force, so that he dropped the\nhall, and allowed M cP hail to nip in for his\nhat-trick and IC's seventh goal.\nOverall therefore a pleasing performance\nfor the lust match of the season, one that\nmust hold good prospects for the rest ol the\nyear. Which is more than can be said about\nthe chances of seeing Rimmers hat-trick jug.\nTeam: I). Broun, . V. Milner, R. Gibaul, I'. Choun, 1). Kindred, S.

Gaston\nsco fed, due to poor IC marking at a corner.\nHowever. .Norley again gave IC the lead\nfollowing another cornel'.\nDuring the li rst half St. Georges had coped\nwith the persistent IC pressure by passing\nback to their goalkeeper but this proved their\nundoing in the second half and allowed\nNorley to complete his hat-trick.\nThere then followed almost total domination by St. Georges but they were\nrestricted to a single A. Robinson goal,\nparticularly due to a line save by the cat-like\nRob Bird, IC's player manager and temporary goalkeeper and excellent mid field play from Dave Tinkler.\nThe game concluded with Colin Baker\npunishing another St. Georges defensive\nerror.\nTeam: R. Bird, M. Benczner, P. Nagle. D. Bradley, P. Rodgers, C. Baker, A. Rose, I). Tinkler, P. Pishwick, T. Donovan, J..

This they did with a shot from the\nedge of the area which went in past an\nupright keeper.\nTowards the end of the game, alter' a revival from Imperial, the opposition notched up their third from a penalty Hick,\nalter a recumbent goalkeeper had lain on the\nball.\nNevertheless, the team's performance gave\ncause for optimism for the remainder ol the\nseason.\nTeam: Boiler, Cnaleucoilh. Riley. Franklin.\nParker. Clarke. Rao. Cray, .ly ers. Bilk Hensal.\nPaul Bullet\nSeconds\nDespite being forced to play on a miserable\nSaturday morning, the seconds reached Sunbury with eleven fully conscious players\nand umpire Martin Shaw. The team started\noil full ol confidence, the defence ol Pete\nCunningham, Mike Pitketulcy, Chris Bird\nand Andy Whitehead dealing very well indeed with a strong Sunbury attack. Pete\nHughes then decided to show the Sunbury\nsupporters on the touch line what college\nhockey is all about. They were certainly left\nwith the right impression as his twenty yard\naerial pass landed in a large bush in somebody's back garden. Unfortunately we\nconceded a goal just before half-time when\nwe were looking the better side.\nThe deficit was quickly wiped out alter the\nbreak with Gordon Bateson scoring alter a line run. The Sunbury defence was then put\nunder tremendous pressure with Andy Garms and Tim Mitchell combining well\ndown the centre of the pitch. As we\ncontinued to throw men forward the\ninevitable happened: Sunbury scored on the\nbreak despite the efforts of Roll Slatter. who\nhad earlier made a superb save to keep us in\nthe game.\nWith time running out we were awarded a penalty alter a finely struck corner from\nHughes. Unfortunately his resulting penalty\nHick failed to gather pace oil the turf and\ncaused the goalkeeper to dive full length in\norder to save the ball before it came to a complete standstill! Despite several more\npenetrating attacks down the right wing, we\nconceded a third goal near the end of the\ngame. This was a line team performance,\ndespite the rather unflattering score line and\nour li rst win cannot be far away.\nAndy Stroomer\nThirds\nThe team maintained its unbeaten record (an\namazing feat for so late in the season) after a well fought hacking session on the Old Creightonian potato patch. Chris Jones (20)\ncareered around the D clearing the ball and\nhostile players alike, while the wallowing s of\nthe rest of the learn achieved the desired\nresult (of staying upright for more of the\ngame than the opposition managed to). After\nan invigorating shower everyone joined Chris\nin the bar lor a well-earned pint.\nThanks arc due to the Tim Allan taxi\nservice, Tim Mitchell lor the time-keeping\nand to everyone else for turning up.\nlearn: A.

    "content": "EXEC VIEWS\nWhat fun, Council met last night. For the benefit of first years our by-laws\nstate that \"the management of the Union shall be vested in a Council \".\nCouncil consists of a variety of hacks and is chaired by yours truly. It\noften discusses financial matters and day to day running of the Union.\nOccasionally Council discusses policy and it has its own policy book to\ncomplement Union policy.\nExamples of Council policy are \"the Deputy President should conduct\nhimself in an orderly fashion\" and \"sexual intercourse is per miss able in\nUnion premises but only when discreet and unavoidable\". Obviously\nthese examples are somewhat facetious and Council often discusses very\nserious matters.\nLast night the most controversial item discussed was the Rag Mag. It\nwas finally decided that the Rag Mag should be put on sale only to IC\nstudents for the time being. The Rag Mag contains jokes which many\nmay find offensive.'\nCouncil last night was not particularly well attended. It is rumoured\nthat this was due to the absence of tea to help sustain members through\nthe meeting. Those of you who were not present can be assured there\nwill be tea next time ! would appreciate it if the absentees would see me\nas soon as possible\nThose members who were present and promised to help out next\nweek with our little problem, please turn up in the Union Office for\ninstructions, etc.\nAnd finally on Council, there are a number of vacant posts especially\non PW P.P WP is the Permanent Working Party and they are concerned\nwith solving internal problems. Last year, for example, they worked on\nrefectories, libraries and Union places on College committees. There are\nfour vacancies, wo of these being reserved for first years. They will be\nelected at the next U GM and Marco will be putting up papers soon. More\nform him on that one soon.\nDon't miss your chance for fame, glory and tea at Council meetings.\nDrat Mark\nIam writing to you about the plight of ICU transport. For those who don't know it\nICU are the proud(?) owners of three crew buses, one transit\nand a land rover. These vans are used by both clubs and individuals lor their var iu os activites at relatively modest\ncharges.\nIt seems to escape a lot of peoples attention that the vans have to have a group of people to look after them. The system should be run by Barney, two transport olli cer s( one from ACC' and one from RC C) and the transport committee comprising of the\nabove plus one representative\nrom each of the major users\nVH A, Canoe, Mountaineering, etc) and, of course,\nJoanna( Union Receptionist), who deals with bookings and keys.\nThe theory of operation is\nquite straightforward. Each major user should be responsible for one vehicle and make sure it is clean and do general servicing. The transport olli cer s are then responsible\nlor more major repairs and the running of the system generally. Barney has overall responsibility. Apart from this a number of responsible\npeople are required to carry out the driving tests.\nAt the moment there is a deficiency intra sn port officers\nof two and very lew people to\ndo tests. This means a general degradation of the vans and a loss of revenue. If the situation is not rectified soon, by people\ncoming forward to offer their\nservices, it is my op in in on that\nthe transport will have to fold\nup with the added inconvenience and cost to the user\nwhich it will involve.} ours\nSteve V eats Acting ACC Transport Olli cer Small Ads\n\u2022Congratulations Jimmy and Pauline on the birth ot your daughter.

    "content": "rEd t f \u00a9/tia\u00a3'\nA bit of a heavy week:j Comraemortion Day\n(Rector and co. send everyone to sleep) followed\nby all this Rag Mag nonsense. On top of all this\nthe typesetter broke J&r w n on Thursday afternoon during the final stages of production\n(hence a possible delay in publication). Sjtill,\nthere have been a few fun items.\nPulling a fast one\nWhile on the subject of Montpelier Street,\nit has come to my attention that the Senior\nWarden, Dr Don Monro, has mysteriously acquired three \"wardens places\" in the new Hall,\nto allocate as he sees fit.\nWarden's places have been the subject of\nsome controversy in the past at IC. It was over-w hel rn ingly agreed by ICU Council that welfare\nplaces are needed for people who need a Hall\nplace due to illness or other disabilities. These\nplaces exist and are allocated by the Welfare\nService.\nWarden's places are not the same. These\nare a 'perk of the job' (as if a rent-free penthouse flat and the satisfaction aren't enough!)\nand are allocated by the individual wardens as\nthey see fit. They often go to welfare cases,\nbut not always (indeed a staff member is now\nliving in Weeks Hall in another of Don Monro's places). They are open to abuse and Council\nagreed in 1980 that they should be phased\nout and replaced by more welfare places.\nSubsequently Student Residence Committee\n(of which Don Monro was then Treasurer and\nnow Chairman) passed a motion which, while\nnot affecting the wardens under contract at that\ntime, ensured that any NEW contracts did not\ninclude a right to warden's places. Don Monro\nis trying to pull a fast one by hoping that nobody\nwill remember, but unfortunately for him I was\non that committee too.\nWorst of all, of course, is that Dr Monro isn't even warden of the Montpelier Street Hall.\nHe is warden of Weeks Hall only, but as Senior'\nWarden is the person to whom the new SubWarden of Montpelier Street is responsible!\nThis blatant attempt to disobey policy of\nwhich he is perfectly well acquainted is a dis-grace. I trust the Exec and the reps on Student\nResidence Committee will INSIST that the places\nare removed from his control immediately.\nThe sports editor\nDue to lack of space this week, some sports.\narticles have had to be cut/not included. I would\nbe grateful in future if articles were not longer\nthan 200 words, unless it is a special match (i.e. cup or tournament). Hopefully this will enable\nme to include everything submitted. I would also\nappreciate it if articles were legible.\nLesley Horrocks\nMontpelier An article has gone into Felix about complaints of lack of facilities at the\\ new hall of residence yet Nick has received no formal complaints himself/ and neither have the relevant authorities. This must not happen in the/ future because this sort of pre judgement can prejudice the chances rfa fair settlement The above clipping is taken from the minutes\nof an Executive Meeting held two weeks ago.\nThese meetings take place every week between\nthe three sabbatical officers (Nick Morton,\nBarney McCabe and Marco Ledwold) and the\nCCU Presidents (who are the Vice Presidents of\nICU).\nThe startling thing about this piece is that the\ncomments made are so incredibly stupid.\nSurely the Executive realise that they, like\nmyself, were elected to act in the interest of the\nstudents and not merely to appease the College\nauthorities . It seems that an article which\nappeared in FELIX concerning how students\nin the new Montpelier Street Hall were being\nripped off (because of the lack of decent facilities) triggered this pathetic response from\nour glorious leaders.\nDid they ask for a rent rebate?\nDid they complain to College?\nDid they even bother to investigate\nthe validity of the claims in the article?\nNo.\nTheir response was the above five lines.\nNo action. No questions. They didn't even\nmention their 'grievance' to me. Mouth a few\nplatitudes, write them down and give yourself\na pat on the back for having done something!\nThis seems to be their attitude.\nI'd like to make my position clear. It is\nquite obvious that if FELIX had not raised\nthis matter the whole affair would have gone by\nunnoticed. It is my opinion that FELEK should\nactively attempt to bring to light any matters\nwhich affect student interests at this College\n(and elsewhere) whether they are embarrassing\nto the College authorities or not.\n\"Nick has received no formal complaints\nhimself,\"-if the mountain will not come to\nMohammed it appears that hell sit on his arse\nuntil it does! If Nick is so concerned, why\ndidn't he take a ten minute walk down to Montpelier Street to check the facts for himself like I did?\n\"This must not happen in the future because\nthis sort of pre-judgement can prejudice the\nchances of a fair settlement,\"\u2014if by raising an\nimportant issue (which the Exec were apparently\nunaware of) we are \"prejudging\" then the Exec\nobviously feel that FELIX cannot be used to\ncampaign for change. They seem to suggest\nthat we made up te whole story to be bloody-minded!!\nMy advice to the Exec is. stop crawling\nto the College and start trying to get concrete\nresults for the students you represent. A rent\nrebate for Montpelier Street residents would\nbe a good start. Why haven't they done it?\nADIOS AMIGOS!\nAlthough he wished us all farewell with an\nAdios Amigos at the end of last summer term,\nSteve Marshall left only yesterday for South\nAmerica. We wish him a long and pleasant\njourney. A list of possible diseases and poisonous\nsnakes was to appear, but we've started on the\nobit ury just in case. Seriously, good luck and\ndon't drink the water, eat the food or trust\nthe natives!\nThe Credits\nMy thanks to the following people without\nwhom I would be even more tired and red-eyed\nby the end of the week: Martin S Taylor, Steve\nGoulder, Shams, Moez, Martin Taylor,\nMohammed, Nobby Stiles, Eddie, Peter, Mike\nMcClancey, Pallab, Chrissie, the ever-smiling\nLesley, Steve Groves, Alistair Kirk, Caroline,\nJane, Ian and Maz.\nA special thanks to the College Press and Publications Department without whom this publication would not have reached you.\nScaramouche\nScaramouche has asked me to clarify that the\neighth group in his puzzle reads \"mn\".

    "content": "Cab\nhits student\nAt approximately1:30 on Monday, anIC student was\ninvoked in an accident on\nPrince Consort Road. According to eye-witnesses,\nhe was waiting on his bicycle\nin the middle ol the road( between Che mEng and Physics). As he turned he\nmoved into the path of an oncoming taxi which was travelling at normal speed.\nHe was hit broadside on and pushed along for about two\nyear ds \u2014 being lucky not to go\nunder the taxi. He was lucky only to sustain a cut on the\nhead, his bike seeming a write-off and the taxi suffering\na slightly stove d in grille and a smashed indicator. Police and ambulance were\nquickly on the scene and having been attended\nto by a doctor before the\nambulance arrived, was quickly taken away.( The fate\nof the bike is. at present, unknown.) Bill\nPassmore\nIC Union has received a bill for \u00a3 4 0 0 from the Estates Department for damage caused to Beit Quadrangle during the summer term. The damage consisted of\nthe removal and later smash ing of one of the lintels from\nthe wall in front of the Union Lower Lounge. It was then\nused for a barbe qi le In a party that included someRS M students and the then\nICU' President. Mr John Passmore. It was felt that his\npresence did not make the\nUnion responsible for this act of vandalism. During the ICU Council Meeting on Monday Mr Morton suggested the Executive look into the situation\nand report to the next Council meeting. Mr Morton, how ever, echoed the feelings of\nCoi u neil when he said that he\nfelt that ICU' should not have\nlo pay this money. I he case\ncontinues.\nRector Soldiers On\nIn a speech given yesterday afternoon at the Commemoration\nDay celebrations in the Albert Hall the Rector, Lord Flowers,\nurged graduates to support Imperial College through the lean\nv ears ahead.\nUsing rhetoric more typical of an Army Major than a leading\nacademic Lord Flowers described the way in which the world\nrecession affected institutions such as our own and suggested tactics for fighting the way through to more pleasant places.\nAt the very outset Lord Flowers reminded his listeners of\nthe present financial situation by intimating that Imperial College\nmay not be able to afford another Commemoration Ceremony.\nHe went on to describe the way in which universities had been\nstudied and criticised in the previous year, suggesting that in\nthe present age they are expected to produce definite results\nin terms of employment of graduates in order to justify their\nexistences. Instead of this, he said, it is scholarship that should\nbe prized.\nHe believed that Imperial College should be committed to\nthe maintenance of standards in teaching and research even though\nthis will not be the easiest of paths. The Rector continued by\nbemoaning the fact that we now have a lower intake of overseas\nstudents than in previous years, saying that this would lower\nthe contribution that Imperial College makes to the world. Imperial College is. he said, encouraging the formation of ex-student\nassociations in many parts of the world and these, together with\nthe Old Student Associations of the three Constituent Colleges,\nought to give their loyalty and support to aid the College through\nthe present troubled times and inspire it to greater things.\nSumming up he stated that we should take courage from\nthe splendid achievements of the past to fact the future un dismayed. Rag Mag\ncontroversy\nLast Friday City and Guilds\nUnion took the unprecedented\nstep of refusing to sell this\nyear's ICU Rag Mag. They\nobjected to some of the\nmore contentious jokes concerning the recent ' H' Block\nhunger strike, and the Yorkshire Ripper case.\nCopies of the publication\nwere brought to the ICU Council meeting on Monday.\nAfter Council had glanced\nthrough the magazine there\nwas an extensive discussion.\nThe President was asked\nif he had checked the proofs\nbefore they were taken away\nto the printers. He claimed\nthat he had taken the proofs\nto look at but had subsequently delegated the job to\nsomebody else in the Union\nOffice. He accepted that had\nhe read the magazine he would\nhave asked for several jokes\nto be removed. Thus he must\nshoulder the blame, he said.\nCouncil then decided that\nuntil the matter was debated\nat aUG M its sale should\nbe restricted to students of\nImperial College. In addition\nit was recommended that Rag\nCommittee alter its constitution to include a statutory\nrequirement for the proofs\nto be approved by members\nof the executive before print-ing.\nThe magazine is now on\nsale from the Union Office\nfor a donation of 30p or\nmore to Rag.\nULU Welcomes\nNobody?\nLast week saw l he Uni vc tsi tv oI London In ion'1 nl in Week\", fins consisted ol .i three-dav clubs an il societies\nfair, several discos an il an all night Intro Ball, all held in\nthe UL U Building in Maki Street. However, mam stud ents in all colleges were unaware of these events due\nto scant publicity. On Tuesday. Wednesday ami Thursday (he Intro Fay re\nsic look place from 2:00 lo\n7:00j mi.

This was\nundoubtedly the highlight of\nthe week, being reasonably\nsuccessful.\nThe lack of attendance at\nmany of the events was clearly\ndue to the lack of publicity. IC was provided with a total\nof three posters, and the Editor of FELIX did not receive details to pub ie ize the\nevents despite strenuous efforts.\nFELIX, October 23, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

Wells Soc\nIncidents of seeing objects or events, which for\nreasons of space or time or other causes, not\ndiscern able through the ordinary sense of\nvision, have occurred since time immemorial.\nFolktales, myths and indeed religious documents including the Bible are full of such\nevents.\nIt hasn't been until this century that this\nphenomenon has been investigated scientifi-call y. The first studies were undertaken by the\nsociety for psychical research, founded in\n1882.\nLast Monday the current president of the\nsociety, Prof Arthur Ellison, addressed the\nH.G. Wells Society on clairvoyance. Prof\nEllison began by giving evidence supporting\nthe validity of clairvoyance, which was so good\nthat the only doubts anyone could have would\nbe doubts on his honesty. Cases of mediums\nachieving an accuracy of 96% in answer to\nquestions from the relatives of deceased\npersons were cited.\nProf Ellison finished off by saying that\nalthough examining other peoples psychic\nexperiences would give a great deal of insight\ninto the workings of the human mind it would\ncontinue to raise more questions than give\nanswers. The next step for people researching\ninto the field would be for themselves to\nundergo psychic experiences through hallucinogenic drugs, like LSD or, for long\nterm effects, through mind training through\nRaja Yoga.\nNext week we will be having Dr Sinclair\nGoodlad delivering a lecture entitled 'Humour,\na serious business?' with excerpts from Tony\nHancock's 'The Blood Donor' and Tom and\nJerry.

A sessions costs \u00a32 for ski club\nmembers. Meet 1:00pm South Kensington\ntube arcade. Come and along and give it a try!\n\u2022\nCanoe\nLast weekend saw the club's first trip away.\nThis time to Crbyde Bay in North Devon,\ncanoe surfing. Despite having to use a crew bus instead of our usual, we eventually managed to\nfind spaces for both people and luggage, and\nset off at about 6:00pm. After a longish stop for\nfood and refreshment we all arrived safely, if a little tired at approximately 1:00am. We awoke\non Saturday morning to find it pouring down\nwith rain and that the waves (ripples is\nprobably more accurate) were smaller than one\nusually sees on the Serpentine. After a hearty\nbreakfast we had a quick tour around the local\nsurf shops and then went to the pub for lunch.\nOn Sunday the surf was a little better but\nnot at all inspiring, especially for those who\nhad been on the summer tour to Brittany.\nOn a slightly brighter note, the club is having\nthree further trips this term.\nOctober 31 to November 1 Mike Jones\nmemorial weekend on the River Dee at\nLlangollen, N Wales. The Dee is one of the\nbest white-water rivers in Britain and this is\none of the few occasions that we are able to\npaddle this river. This trip is highly recommended for the more experienced paddlers.\nNovember 29 River Dart, Devon. The Dart\nis also a very interesting river with good\nstretches for both novice and experienced\npaddlers.\nDecember 12 and 13 surfing trip to Bude.\nHopefully we will have better luck with the surf\nthis time.\nFor more information about the above trips\nor just canoeing in general don't hesitate to\ncome and see us.\nMeetings every Tuesday6:30 pm in the\nswimming pool or 8:30pm in Stan's Bar Upper\nLounge. Alternatively contact: Tim Clark,\nME3; Neil MacMillan, CE3; or, Doreen Thomas, Chem2. Chess\nThe final results from the 1980/1 season\nbecame known over the summer. A summary of\nthe results is as follows. In the Middlesex\nPremier Division the first team finished equal\nthird or points and beat Wood Green in the\nprocess. (We were the only team in the whole\ncountry to do so.) The second team finished\nsecond in the second division and have gained\npromotion. We were winners and runners-up\nin the London University Pugh Cup and in the\nIntercollegiate League our three teams finished\nthird, first, and third respectively. The College\nChampionship was a three-way tie between D.B. Lund (Maths 1), M. McCall( Physics 1) and\nR.A. Coles (Maths 3).\nOur first event of this season was the\nFreshers' Lightning tournament on Monday,\nOctober 12. Forty-two people entered and a nine round swiss competition was played.\nMost of the strongest players had surprise\ndefeats in the early rounds and with a good win\nin the last round Jeremy Fraser-Mitchell from\nPhysics won with 772 /9. Other leading results\nwere 2-4: M.G. Benson, D.B. Lund, R.L. Smith; 7/9 5: R. Hasan 6>/2 /9.\nICCAG\nThings have now got into full swing.\nAnyone wanting to go on the Soup Run just\nturn up in Falmouth kitchens at 10:30pm on\nTuesdays and Fridays.

If you're interested come along to\nthe meetings on Mondays.\n. See you then,\nRebecca May Yacht\nIC Yacht Club started the new season last\nweekend when sixteen members and a clapped out minibus travelled down to\nLymington harbour on the Solent. We had two\nboats for the weekend: an OOD34 and a Red\nAdmiral 37, both of which are comfortable\nyachts and exciting to sail.\nSaturday dawned grey and damp, but with\nplenty of wind. After a substantial break f st we\nheaded up the Solent towards Cowes. The\nstrong winds made sailing exciting, at least for\nthose not busy throwing their breakfast back\nover the side. After lunch at the Island Sailing\nClub in Cowes, we sailed back across the\nSolent to spend the night in the Hamble River,\nwhere we celebrated the Captain's birthday in\nsuitable fashion at the Jolly Sailor.\nLight winds on Sunday enabled the boats to\nsail back to Lymington with spinnakers flying\u2014or in the case of one meg lo maniac skipper, with a series of coloured sails being\nhauled up and down the mast in quick succession by a rapidly tiring crew.\nIf you want to sail on a voyage of discovery,\nfind those little known south coast hostelries\nand experience latex custard, come to a yacht\nclub meeting on Thursdays at 12:30pm in the\nBotany Common Room.\nGraffitti\nGraffitti is alive and kicking, and waiting for\ncommissions, but please give us at least two to\nthree weeks . notice if you want us to print\nsomething. Unfortunately we cannot do\nposters with two days notice since members\ndesign and print them in their own time and, as\nyou well know, that tends to be limited once\nthe term gets into full swing.\nGraffitti meets on Wednesdays at 12:30pm in the workshop, west staircase, Union Building. See you there!\nDave Po/ey, ME3\nChairman\nSnooker\nA very successful Freshers' Tournament was\nheld last Saturday which attracted twenty-four\nentries. The winner was S. Calvert, who beat\nR.
