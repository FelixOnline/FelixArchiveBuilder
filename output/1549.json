Sophie Shina looks at telecare\nO\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPrimes, primes everywhere!\nScience Writer\nFRIDAY 31 MAY\n10\nne third of babies born\nin 2012 are expected to\ncelebrate their 100th\nbirthday, according to\ngovernment statistics.\nWhilst ageing populations are a victory of development, health and social\ncare systems are struggling to cope\nwith the burden of long-term care. As\na result, the need for healthcare innovation has intensi\ufb01ed \u2014 is large-scale\ntelecare implementation the answer\nwe are looking for?\nDepicted by one patient as like having a \u201clittle nurse sitting on [his] shoulder,\u201d telecare is an innovative eHealth\nservice which aims to help patients\nwho are either frail and elderly, or\nwho have a long term condition, to\nlive more independent lives. It uses a\ncombination of sensors, alarms and\nother equipment to monitor changes\nin a patient\u2019s health. he most common forms include personal alarms,\nwhereby pressing a button on a pendant alerts a local control centre, and\nmotion sensors which automatically\ncontrol bathroom and hallway lights,\nthereby reducing the likelihood of\nfalls.\nTelecare can signi\ufb01cantly increase\nthe quality of life for people with a\nhigh dependency on health services\nthrough facilitating self-care and re-Mathematicians from the US, Hungary and Turkey just might be one step\ncloser towards the impossible. One of\nthe greatest problems in number theory is determining whether the number\nof prime tuples, prime numbers which\nlie very close to each other, is in\ufb01nite.\nIn short, \u201care there an in\ufb01nite number\nof prime tuples which lie next to each\nother?\u201d\nhe authors present a mathematical technique which shows that there\nare an in\ufb01nite number of prime tuples within 16 or less from each other.\nWhile this does not fully solve the\nlong-standing problem, the research\npublished in Annals of Mathematics at\nleast o\ufb00ers a \u201cpartial solution\u201d.\nPrime numbers are divisible only\nby themselves and 1. For example, 2,\n3 and 5 are all prime since they can\nonly be divided by themselves and 1.\nWhereas 4 is not, since it can be divided by itself, 1 and 2. his makes it\nseem that there are less primes than\nthere are positive integers; however,\nmathematics can tell us that there are\nas many prime numbers as there are\npositive integers.\nHowever, as the size of the number\nincreases, the distance between adjacent prime numbers also increases.\nAndy Roast his means that the chance that any\ngiven number is prime decreases as\nthe size of the number increases. he\nresearch indicates that even with a\ndecreasing probability of \ufb01nding two\nprimes close to one-and-other, primes\nA stained glass window of primes.

Many academics have\ncriticised the early evaluation of the\nWhole System Demonstrator Programme and the subsequent haste to\nmake policy based on what they perceive as little evidence. Indeed, the\nlatest analyses of the programme released earlier this year found no signi\ufb01cant positive impacts for patients\nor on the use of other health and social\ncare services. In addition, there have\nbeen several un\ufb01nished pilots over the\nlast few years as a result of the organisational and operational complexity of\ntelecare implementation.\nSo is the scale up of telecare an ambitious gamble by a government with\nscarce resources?

One effect of GLV release is to attract predatory insects to defend the\nplant, though how effective they\u2019d be against a lawnmower is another question.\nUnfortunately for grass the resulting released GLVs also create the pleasant\nodour associated with a freshly-mown lawn. And so the carnage continues...\nwith very close neighbours are still in\ufb01nitely many. A weird result, since this\nmeans that prime tuples are as numerous as the set of positive integers.\nDOI: 10.4007/annals.2009.170.819\n\n"

I will start\nwith the bad news. The\ntragic death of an Imperial alumnus is not the most pleasant\nthing to be reporting. It reminds me\nof another incident earlier this year,\nwhich was similarly upsetting to put\ninto the paper. The fact that so much\nmoney has been raised in his memory in such a short time, and that he\nseems to have had so many friends\nat Imperial, shows that his character\nmust have been strong. It is particularly upsetting that he died so young,\nand left behind a wife. I hope that\nhis friends and family can take some\ncomfort in the fact that he seems to\nhave inspired a lot of people into being very generous: to raise that much\nmoney in barely any time at all is almost unbelievable. Hopefully, the field\nhospital will help people and so it will\nbe for a good cause.\nSome good news\nThereissomegoodnewstotalkabout.\nFirstly, there is the Fleming Library reopening after donations. There are\nalways a few students that feel the\nneed to essentially move into a library\naround this time (if they weren\u2019t students they would probably even have\nto pay council tax), and they should be\npleased that it\u2019s looking pretty plush.\nImperial teams also seem to be dominating the Engineers Without Borders\nChallenge. I\u2019m glad that they had the\nopportunity to take such a course,\nand hopefully more students will get\nto benefit from these extra courses\nnext year. Take the opportunity to do\nsomething beyond your subject next\nyear if you haven\u2019t already. Trust me,\nyou\u2019ll really regret it if you don\u2019t. When\nyou\u2019re in a job, your life becomes more\nrigid, and learning about new things\nbecomes restricted to documentaries\nby the latest dough-eyed scientist.\nThis actually extends to taking part\nin clubs and societies at the Union\nas well. Hobbies take time, effort and\nmoney, and, here, you have an opportunity to do something fun while not\nlosing too much of all three.\nElections again\nThe Summer Elections have loomed\nup once again. It\u2019s that super stressful work season, so the last thing you\nprobably want is for someone to start\nwaving their arms in your face telling\nyou they\u2019ll instantly transform your\nlife into blissful relaxation if you click a\nbutton. Firstly, try to be gentle to anyone distracting you to give you sweets\nand a voting link. Secondly, spend\nthe few seconds it takes to vote and\nmake a difference. All the positions\nmatter in their own way. As with all\npart time positions they can be made\nbigger or smaller by the person filling\nit. This is to say that if someone truly\nproactive is in the role they could really change some things for the better.\nThe fact that all Union positions aren\u2019t\nelected in one burst does make people a bit bored with the whole proce-dure. It\u2019s tough on everyone involved,\nbecause the previous round of voting\nhappened before Easter when people\nweren\u2019t as busy, stressed, tired of Imperial, tired of work, or all of the above.\nThis means the Summer Elections\nalways have a vastly reduced turnout\ncompared to their counterparts before\nEaster.\nThere is actually a big position up for\ngrabs: Deputy President (Education).\nThis is the person that is in charge of\nyour educational needs. Need to complain about a lecturer\u2019s terrible notes?\nThey are your first port of call. They\nalso head up the Rep system, which\nis all of the Dep Reps and Year Reps\nwho sit on the Student Staff Committees. You only have one week to vote,\nso make an informed decision and go\nfor it. If you don\u2019t like any of the candi-dates, click RON or abstain.

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 31 MAY\n18\nt is slightly perplexing for a\nfew seconds. Laura Marling\nis a name seemingly sliding\noff everyone\u2019s lips at the mo-ment, yet still, seems to be\nunheard of to more than a fair few.\nWidely known but remaining anony-mous, this enigma-like quality continues to run through her music, her\nfourth album, Once I Was An Eagle,\nbeing no exception.\nThe first single, \u2018Master Hunter\u2019\nis the most poppy song on the al-bum. Poppy, in this context referring\nto the most catchy and structured\ntrack. Dylan references and the\nonly song which features prominent\ndrumming, it is no wonder that it\nwas chosen to be the one of the first\npreviewed prior to album release.\nMost of the other fifteen are more\nakin to long, insightful musings. PerSoar Like An Eagle?\nLilly Le examines the intricacies of Laura Marling\u2019s latest effort\nsonally, I am a great fan of such stuff;\nfor those who are not, it is probably\nnot an album for them. Surprisingly,\nOnce I Was An Eagle is not an album\nI would judge people for disliking. It\nis not an album I would try and ram\ndown my friends\u2019 throats. Unlike her\nprevious releases, and especially unlike I Speak Because I Can, darling\nMarling seems to be finally releasing\nmusic which I can imagine many listeners not enjoying.\nWith each LP, she has become\nmore distant from her early teenage\nreleases. Previously full of haste with\nan annoying \u201cfolk\u201d image, dropping\nNoah and The Whale\u2019s Charlie Fink\nin favour of Ethan Johns\u2019 production was probably the best thing she\ndid musically. Since then, her songs\nhave matured at impressive speed.\nMarling has gone from moulding\nI\nherself to fit a London scene to an\nindependent songstress brimming\nwith Americana; with four albums\nunder her belt at the age of 23.\nHer latest one opens with a four-song medley, previewed via a beautiful film full of twirling dancers and\nromancers \u2018When Brave Bird Saved.\u2019\nThis, combined with three which\nhave been streaming on her Sound\nCloud for the past couple of months,\nmake the 16-track album less of a\ndaunting thing. Plus, don\u2019t bother\nwith \u2018Interlude\u2019.\nThe remaining eight require two\nthings to be enjoyed. Firstly, being\nin the right mood. Many people mistakenly believe this would be a depressive one, but I would personally\nwarn against that (it doesn\u2019t help)\n\u2013 more of a state of contemplation\nand retreat. Secondly, it requires listening several times. This is no bad\nthing, the best songs are the ones\nyou get to know over time rather\nthan those which jump at you first\ntime and hardly ever again.\nCompared to earlier records, the\npieces are less layered, mainly focussing on her guitar and her voice\njoining in here and there, humming\nalong only when she feels like it.\nMarling\u2019s poetic prowess is not lost,\nbut is half transferred to the musical bed rather than fully channelled\nthrough the lyrics as they used to be.\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed, however, is\nher aloof approach to song-writing.\nIt is obvious that the songs do not\ncome directly from personal experi-ence, but more of an empathy for the\ncharacters she sings about. Plus, she\nis a great source of inspiration when\ntrying to find a book to read \u2013 one\nwhich has moved someone to write a\nsong about it is obviously one worth\ngetting lost in. I tip my hat off to\nSalinas (off of third album A Creature I Don\u2019t Know) and its nod to\nSteinbeck\u2019s East of Eden.\nRather than the majestic instrumental composition which bathed\npervious releases, the parts that\njump out are the tender guitar\nstrings which echo the melody of\nher voice. Try \u2018Little Bird\u2019 and your\nheart will swell as she sings the name\n\u201cRosie\u201d.\nInstead of her long poetic verses,\nwhich bulked up older albums, are\nshort, sharp phrases which send\nchills down the spine.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where you\u2019ve gone beast\n\u2013 I care where you go.\u201d \u2013 Take the\nNight Off\n\u201cWhen we were in love - if we were -I was an eagle and you were a dove.\u201d\n- I Was an Eagle\n\u201cWrestle in the rope from darkness is no fucking life that I would\nchoose.\u201d \u2013Master Hunter\n\u201cMaybe I like pleasure-pain.\u201d \u2013 Little Bird\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t my curse. You weren\u2019t\nmy curse. Thank you naivety for failing me again.\u201d \u2013 Saved These Words.\nThis closing track, as they usually\nare, is the personal highlight of the\nalbum. Understated and elegant it\nleaves the listener with a sweet af-tertaste. It is similar to watching a\ntouching film and for five short minutes feeling as though you see your\nlife in a whole new way and that you\nare a completely different person.\nAMS album of the week\nWith my short side-parted hair and\ncorduroy jacket, I\u2019m about as far away\nfrom metal as you can get. Always\nopen to new experiences, however,\nDeafheaven\u2019s upcoming sophomore\nalbum Sunbather caught my eye. Described as \u201cshoegaze with black metal\ndrumming and vocals,\u201d and with a cover more reminiscent of drinking pink\nlemonade on a summer\u2019s day than of satanic rituals in Norwegian forests,\nit looked to be far from the usual black metal fare. It seems that the span\nfrom shoegaze through post-rock to metal may not be an impossible one\nto bridge.\nBeginning with an unrelenting torrent of distorted guitars and frantic\ndrums, it lives up to the description: this is undeniably black metal \u2013 purists may claim that it\u2019s not \u201ctrve\u201d enough \u2013 but with a major key, a series\nof powerful crescdeni and melodic tunes picked out on the lead guitar,\nit takes the genre in a completely new direction \u2013 at least to this outside\nobserver. This may be the most uplifting album I\u2019ve heard all year.\nWhile I\u2019m no stranger to screamed vocals, those who are certainly\nshouldn\u2019t be put off \u2013 incoherent and fierce, yet not grating, they blend\nso well into the mix that they become almost like just another guitar ef-fect. They could just as easily be screams of anger as they could of pure,\nunadulterated joy.\nThe album\u2019s fourth and central song, \u2018Please Remember\u2019, provides a\nbrief respite after twenty minutes of the near-continual wall of sound\nwith sampled speech over a back-masked strings loop which eventually\ndecays, drowned out by ever-increasing distortion until a soft acoustic\nguitar rhythm plays out the rest of the track. This wouldn\u2019t sound out of\nplace at all on a Godspeed You! Black Emperor album, yet fits perfectly\nhere, before the following track slowly builds back up to the unmistakable\nphenomenally fast-paced metal sound.\nUndeniably heavy and powerful, yet at the same time optimistic and\ndreamy, metalheads and shoegazers alike should find something to enjoy\nhere. This album is, if you\u2019ll pardon the phrase, not black metal but bright\nmetal.\nDeafheaven -Sunbather\nKeir Little\n\n"

However Apple TV has never really hit o\ufb00 (well not as popular as other\nApple products) with the general pub-lic, due to the fact that it was not very\ngeneral in its abilities, limiting you to\nwatching movies/TV shows over iTunes\nor streaming from your computer. his\nFRIDAY 31 MAY\n24\nH\nyour current set up to be connected to\nyour new console. Apart from serving\nas an entertainment hub it can access\nthe internet, run Windows 8 apps, let\nyou watch TV, Skype calls, play bluray discs, oh and did I forget to men-tion, it also happens to play games.\nNow that seems to be the attitude\nwith which Microsoft approached the\nXbox One, despite the 360 being one\nof the most successful \ufb02agships for the\nhardcore gamer. Eight years ago when\nthe 360 was released, in 2005, the \ufb01rst\niPhone was probably a bunch of wires\nin some Apple technician\u2019s desk and\nwent on to be quite a hit. So why did\nMicrosoft totally change their apparently winning strategy? Smartphones\nand tablets, that\u2019s why. With the advent of free-to-play games and casual\ngamers, the money in the market has\nmoved away from the classic niche of\nthe console gamer, where, apart from\nthe big name titles, there are rarely any\nsuccess stories. herefore with this\nstrategy of controlling your multimedia as well as o\ufb00ering a quality gaming\nconsole, Microsoft is hoping to appeal\nto those casual as well as hardcore\ngamers, and thus maximise pro\ufb01ts.\nNow what does this strategy mean\nfor the major competitors of the Xbox\nOne, the Wii U and the PS4. Well Sony\nseems to have retained the same strategy with the PS4 as the PS3, and in fact\nNintendo has tried to go the opposite\nway with making the Wii U: appealing\nmore to the hardcore gamer than the\nWii. So it seems that the Xbox\u2019s strat-Xbox One: Ton of fun?\nApparently the one and only center of your new Multimedia world!\nThe News Bubble\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date with the\nnewest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.\nMini Galaxy\nSamsung seems to have inadvertently shown off one of its new products, the\nGalaxy S4 Mini. For a short while it was possible to see the, at this point unreleased product, in the Samsung Online store. The site has now been taken\ndown, but the existence of the Mini is all but confirmed. Purportedly to be\nofficially announced on the 20th of June, it will carry some respectable specs\nand aim to replicate its big brothers success in the mid-range smartphone\nmarket.\niWatch the Advert\nWatching the new iPhone 5 advert, some of the more sharp-eyed of you may\nhave noticed one of the people in the video wearing a square wrist watch.\nApple are supposedly masters of advertising, so that may suggest this was a\npurposeful measure to further increase the hype surrounding the iWatch. It\ndoes seem to have striking similarity to artist\u2019s renditions, so you never know.\nOn the other hand, the actor could have just had a really ugly watch.\nBuzz, Buzzing no more\nGoogle Buzz, one of the tech giant\u2019s failed attempts at a social network is now\nbeing closed down for good. All the data on the website will go into a private\nGoogle server for all the stuff that people kept private, and all the stuff on the\nprofile that was public will be going into a public server where the general\npublic will still be able to view everything.\nFacebook phone fail\nThe HTC First, aka the Facebook phone has officially failed. The Android\ndevice, which was hyped pre-launch has failed to sell in the US, even after\nthe price was dropped to $0.99. This rather cold reception has now led to\nthe European, including UK, launch to be postponed indefinitely. Facebook\nthemselves have called the phone a failure. Perhaps this just goes to show that\npeople do not want their whole phone dominated by their Facebook account.\nWhat\u2019s Black, White and Flat all\nover?\nApparently iOS 7! Now that Jonny Ive has taken over the design of the new\niOS after Scott Forstall\u2019s dismissal, speculators on the internet are coming up\nwith the most interesting rumours. The first no-brainer that I\u2019ve come across\nis that Ive, who hates the skeumomorphic design, will get rid of the faux leather as well as all the other \u201creal life\u201d approximations, to make way for a cleaner,\nflatter look more in line with the actual devices themselves. There are several\nconcept videos on the web right now, and most of them look really good, so\nhave a look if it tickles your fancy!\nOn A Personal Note\nRemember those epic bluetooth headphones I bought about 6 months ago?\nYeah, well I managed to kinda break them by stepping on them. In a study\ninduced haze, I didn\u2019t watch my step and managed to snap the plastic bit that\nattaches one of the headphones to the actual bridge. They still work perfectly,\nexcept that they won\u2019t stay on my head. Well, every cloud has a silver lining,\nright? In my case that silver lining is an upgrade in the form a 5 pound more\n(\u00a325) pair, from the same company, which have not let me down. In fact they\nare even a bit more sturdy than the previous ones ( I hope).\n\u201d\n\u201c\nApple TV; just\nanother device\nin your burgeoning pile of\njunk surrounding your TV.\nTech editor\negy is unique in this market. here\nare two possible consequences of\nthis uniqueness. One, the average\nconsole gamer is pissed o\ufb00 at Microsoft for betraying them and selling\nout, meaning they will probably buy\nthe PS4. Two, if the hardcore gamer\ndoesn\u2019t care what his console does\napart from o\ufb00ering the best gaming\nexperience possible, then the Xbox\nseems just as attractive as its com-petitors. he big di\ufb00erence is that\neven if Microsoft loses some of those\ntrue gamers, it will likely get more of\nthe not so gaming inclined folks who\nlike their devices to make their lives\nsomewhat easier.\nMaximilian Eggl\n\u201d\n\u201c\neven if they\nloses some\nof those true\ngamers, it will\nlikely get not\nso gaming\ninclined folks\ndoes not make other devices obsolete\nor replace them, in fact it\u2019s just another\ndevice in your burgeoning pile of junk\nsurrounding your TV.\nNow let the Xbox One step into the\nlight. Firstly the name; the Xbox One\nitself refers to the fact that it will be the\nonly device you will need in your home\n(except for the Screen, TV-box etc.), and\nwill serve as the hub of all your entertainment needs. hus it seems that everything will be controlled by this central\nhub, which certainly does help to reduce\nthe copious amounts of remote controls\nthat lay around. It not only has a HDMI\ninput, but also an output allowing for\nI SEEEEEEEE YOU\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFRIDAY 31 MAY\ning presence of commercial in\ufb02uence at\nthe Sports ground during these events,\nbut this year was frankly unbelievable.\nOn arriving at the gate to the ground\nan o\ufb03cious man in a security uniform\nmet me and told my family and me\nthat we had to park our cars in a space\na great distance from the pitch next to\na set of bins. I was told that I could not\npark where I had parked every year for\nthe last 30 years over-viewing the pitch\n- so that in the event of rain my family could retire to the car and still be\nable to see their old dad give the young\nlads of the uni an education in the\nart of hockey, because that space was\nreserved for \u201cthe \ufb01rst team\u201d. Indeed\nthere was a barrier across more than\nhalf of the car park which was manned\nby another o\ufb03cious man in a security\nhut and beyond this barrier was a set\nof ostentatious cars belonging, as it\nturned out, to players from some half-baked football club, none of which have\nprobably got a set of A\u2019 levels let along\nbeen enrolled on a course at our treasured college in central London. I asked\nMick Reynolds, the out going groundsman - whose \ufb01rst year in charge was\nthe same year that I entered as a fresher at college - what was going on and\nhe expressed dismay, explaining that\nalumni and students were not allowed\nin the vast majority of the clubhouse\nbecause the college had let it out to this\nfootball club! What was more my 10\nyear old son was thrown o\ufb00 one of the\nfootball pitches where he had wanted\nto kick his football in one of the very\nmany unused goals because supposedly it belonged to the reserve squad.\nLet me get something straight here -I was appalled to see that my college\nhad sold out to pro\ufb01t, and that today\nalumni and students came last in the\norder of priority for use of college fa-cilities. What is going on? Have you all\ngone completely insane? You are a university - you are meant to educate the\nyoung men and women of this country\nand in the process, make Britain great.\nYou are not meant to be selling out to\nthe highest bidder and squeezing students into a corner by a set of bins.\nStudents are the entire raison d\u2019etre of\nthe college and aside from matters of\nsecurity there should be no place that\nthey should not be allowed to go.\nhis is particularly the case with\nHarlington and the Boat House in\nPutney. It seems the College has conveniently forgotten where these facilities came from and who paid the price\nfor them. Just to remind you - if you\nread the governing body minutes dating back to the period just after World\nWar I - as I have done - and trace the\nhistory forward to today you will learn\nthat Harlington and the Boat House in\nPutney were bought with the proceeds\nof sale of the War Memorial Ground in\nWembly North London. hat in turn\nthe War Memorial Ground was bought\nwith funds raised by a trust established to commemorate the fallen in\nWWI a trust called the War Memorial\nFund. hese grounds were bought with\nthe blood of fallen students in World\nWar I and through the charitable giving of other students and their families\nat that time who all expected the money they were giving to go for the good\nof students. To instead put students\nat the bottom of the line of priority is\na gross breach of trust and makes me\nfeel sick in my stomach. When I was\npresident of the ICU in 1987 the then\nChairman of the Governing Body a\nHigh Court Judge recognised the importance of the heritage of these sporting assets and forced the college to return them to trust for the good of the\nstudents. It now seems that his ruling\nhas been completely disregarded by\ncurrent college administration and not\nonly do I and my children have to be\nmarginalized by someone who does not\neven work for the college on the one day\nthat I wish to show o\ufb00 the wonders of\nmy student heritage to my family but it\nappears that the students have to play\nsecond \ufb01ddle the entire year around.\nI would like to understand for the\nsake of the fallen students from World\nWar I and their memory, exactly how\nmuch money is being made from the\nletting of these student facilities to outside bodies and how the college justi\ufb01ed the detriment su\ufb00ered by the student body as worth the bene\ufb01t of the\nmoney raise, and I would further like\nto see how this money is being spent to\nthe bene\ufb01t of students and in particular student sporting activities. Please\nnote that I will not be swayed by any\nuse of this money that in my view is\nbeing used to reduce the grant that\ncentral college has been obliged to pay\nto support student sport and other recreational activities since the establishment of the college back at the turn of\nthe last century. I expect to be able to\nsee some demonstrable improvement\nin bene\ufb01ts to the students that has\narisen out of the letting of these facilities which might make it worthwhile\nmy family being stuck by a set of bins\nand us all (students, alumni and their\nfamilies) being treated like third class\ncitizens.\nIan Howgate\nImperial College Union President\n1987-88\nI have to say that it is my view that\nthis communication should be going\nto the Rector of the College and in my\nday as a student we would have had\nthe right to take a letter straight to his\ndoor. However of course in my day I\ncould have raised this matter to the\nrector either in my weekly meetings\nwith him, by picking up the telephone\nor by raising it at the Governing Body\nor Finance and Executive committees.\nHowever it seems that in today\u2019s world\neven the alumni have to take a back\nseat in regard to communications with\ncollege o\ufb03cials and hence I am forced\nto write to you.\nYou will probably have grasped that\nthis is not a letter of commendation\nto the college but a letter of complaint\nand I would like a formal response and\nexplanation.\nTwo weeks back I attended my regular alumni event at the college by participating in the president\u2019s match day\ncelebration where alumni and students\nmeet and come face to face across the\nplaying \ufb01elds at Harlington and battle\nout for supremacy. I have been participating in this particular event since\n1984 when as a fresher I was selected\nas the university centre half and had\nthe privilege of playing against some\nex-students who promptly taught me a\nthing or two about hockey.\nWhat I and others learned about\nteam work, fair play, strategy and\ndetermination on the playing \ufb01elds\nat Harlington during our time at\nIC should not be under-estimated.\nFrankly I believe that it was far more\nimportant training for my time in industry than what was given to me in\nthe lecture theatres and labs at the\nSouth Kensington site - 99% of which I\nwould never use again.\nOver recent years I had noticed a ris-Letters\nfelixonline.co.uk/contact\nBy selling use of the sports grounds to the highest bidder, College\nis forgetting the families of the WWI dead who paid for them\n\n"

Many former students will remember it both as a place for study\nand to attend some wonderful social\nevents. hanks to a major refurbishment funded by he St Marys Development Trust and by Imperial College it is now a joy to behold and is\n\ufb01t for the 21st Century. It certainly\ninvites study and there is provision\nboth on the ground \ufb02oor and in the\ntransformed gallery with modern fa-cilities, superb lighting and comfortable furniture. here is an elegant\nstaircase which allows easy access to\nthe gallery. I hope it will be used and\nenjoyed by many present and future\nstudents and I also hope that alumni\nwill make a point of coming to see\nthe transformation which has sensitively retained all the oak and other\nfeatures while becoming thoroughly\nmodern. Deborah Shorley who was\nthe Librarian in Imperial deserves a\nspecial mention for her foresight and\nher perseverance.\u201d\nSta\ufb00, students, doctors, medical\nprofessionals and the funders celebrated the reopening of the Fleming\nLibrary earlier this month.\nhe refurbishment appears to be a\ngreatly needed boost to the library,\nwhich was last redone in 1982. he\nupgrades include a redecoration, new\nstaircases, improved heating, lighting,\nWi\ufb01, more computers, a study space\nand a training room.\nhe library \u2013 designed by Sir Edwin\nHistoric library reopens\ncontinued from the front page\n>> Cooper who designed many other\nbuildings including the NatWest\nbuilding on 1 Princes Street \u2013 was\noriginally opened in 1933. he building was used for student activities\nup until 1982. It also played host to\nGilbert & Sullivan productions over\nChristmas, one of which was attended\nby Her Majesty he Queen and Princess Margaret in 1945.\nSo, next year\u2019s stressful all nighters\nwill be in a more modern setting.\nRead online at felixonline.co.uk\nBefore (left) and after (right) the refurbishment, it\u2019s like changing rooms\nunder less pressure than the others.\nhe Graduate Students\u2019 Union\n(GSU, formerly GSA) will be electing\ntheir committee for next year. Last\nyear, many of these positions had to be\nre-run as nobody put themselves forward for the positions. his seems to\nbe also happening this year, as multiple positions are uncontested. 8 out of\nthe 14 positions available will have to\nbe re-run as nobody is going for them.\nhere is also the problem with one\nperson going for two positions that\ncannot be simultaneously held.\nThere was a problem with the website for the elections. This year, the\ncandidates submitted manifestos for the\nwebsite by writing them in a text box\non the website. They could therefore\nwrite a draft in this box, save their pro-gress, and adjust the manifesto until the\ndeadline. When the deadline had past,\nthe manifesto would be locked from editing and the last version would be up\non the voting website. During this elec-tion, there was an error, and students\nand, more importantly candidates, were\nable to see the manifestos that other\ncandidates had submitted (pictured).\nThis means that candidates could have\nchanged their manifestos based on others that were submitted. The problem\nwas swiftly rectified after the Union\nwere informed of the issue.\nThis year, the position of RAG Chair\nwill not be in the Summer Elections.\nThis was instead elected at the RAG\nAGM.

I mean with\nstyle and true feeling.\nhe Voice is a TV show which\nsearches for these very people and\nassesses them on the quality of their\nvoices alone. In the so called \u201cBlind\nAuditions\u201d the vocal coaches cannot\ninitially see the contestants as their\nchairs are turned backwards. If they\nlike what they hear and want the singer to join their team they press their\nbuzzer and their chair spins around.\nhis can be exciting and nerve-wracking; if no one spins around the\ncontestant goes home. And if more\nthan one coach spins around a \ufb01ght\nfor the singer ensues. Unlike The X\nFactor, in which the best, worst, and\nmost unusual acts are televised, he\nVoice\u2019s Blind Audition contestants are\nselected on vocal merit. Whilst the\n\ufb01rst round of he X Factor can involve\nlaughing at the poorer contestants\nrather than enjoying the better perfor-mances, the contestants in he Voice\u2019s\nBlind Auditions are of a consistently\nhigh standard. After the Blind Auditions, the competition continues with\nbattle rounds between team members\nand eventually a live sing o\ufb00 before an\noverall winner is crowned. hese later\nrounds are not as thrilling as the initial\nBlind Auditions but are nevertheless a\n\ufb01ne showcase of vocal expertise. he\nVoice is a talent show like no other\nand most certainly deserves your at-tention.\nhe Voice started in he Netherlands in 2010 and was such a success\nthat it has now spread to 50 other\ncountries or regions, 8 of which also\nhave children\u2019s competitions.

If, however,\nthe UK programme irks you for some\nreason, try he Voice Australia with\nthe beautiful Delta Goodrem, he\nVoice Holland in which the coaches\u2019\nfeedback is in mind-boggling Dutch\nor he Voice Ireland in which the\ncoaches sit on di\ufb00erently styled red\nchairs and argue a lot.\nBut before you get stuck in it is my\nduty to warn you of the possible side\ne\ufb00ects of this programme. Firstly, revision e\ufb00orts could be hampered; you\ncan \ufb01nd more than 8 hours of Blind\nAuditions\u2019 footage on BBC iPlayer.\nAnd secondly, there is a risk of su\ufb00ering from what I like to call, for obvious\nreasons, the \u201cWimbledon e\ufb00ect\u201d. You\nstart to believe that you too can sing\ndespite 25 years\u2019 worth of evidence\nsuggesting otherwise.

Over\nthe last ten years, the Union roles and\nremits for the President and four deputy Presidents have been kept relatively\nconstant.\nhe paper was brought to Union\nCouncilbythecurrentSabbaticalTeam.\nIt explains that during the last ten years,\nthe Union has developed to be a di\ufb00erent organisation to what it used to be:\nit is a registered charity that employs\n45 members of full time sta\ufb00 and has a\nturnover of \u00a35.5 million. External factors have also changed signi\ufb01cantly, for\nexample the change in tuition fees\nhe current Sabbaticals are proposing\nchanges to the exact role descriptions\nfor the role of the Sabbatical; they also\nbelieve this is something that should be\nreviewed every 4 or 5 years according to\nthe needs of current students.\nA comparison of the Union with\nother student Unions was undertaken.\nComparisons were made with institutions that are a similar size to Imperial,\nas well as those who scored well in the\nNSS survey question where students\nare require to rank their students\u2019 un-ion.\nhe paper states that the Sabbaticals\nbelieve the Union does not do enough\nto: support postgraduate students,\nsupport volunteering, support international students, support students\nbased on campuses other than South\nKensington, enable internationalisation\namongst the student, e\ufb00ect liberation\nof minorities, develop student\u2019s career\nopportunities and campaign for fairer\nliving costs in London. he last of these\nthey say was under the spotlight \u201cparticularly this year, with #AgainstActon\nand the North Acton development\u201d\n.\nhe paper also says that the Sabbaticals are keen to add in careers, student\ndevelopment, an aspect of post graduate support and volunteering to the\ncurrent role of the Deputy President\n(Finance & Services, DPFS).\nhis proposal has two discussion\npoints. he \ufb01rst is adding in the remits\nstate above into the Sabbatical roles.\nhe second is renaming the role of the\nDPFS to Deputy President (Community\n& Development), where the remit of the\nDPFS will remain but with the aforementioned additions. he reason given\nis that \u201cthis would more aptly describe\nwhat the DPFS role does on a day-to-day basis\u201d\nhe paper is clear to mention that the\nSabbaticals are \u201cnot proposing removing any remits from any of the roles. We\nare happy (and believe) that sabbaticals\nin this organisation should always retain\ncertain powers and ability to do things,\neven if they\u2019re not what they (going for-ward) are required to do day to day.\u201d\nAt the moment, it is merely a discussion and not an action.\nExtra Sabbatical remits discussed\nPresident\nAccommodation\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties)\nNon-SK Campuses\nVolunteering\nDeputy President (Education)\nInternationalisation\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices)\nStudent Development and Skills\nDevelopment\nPostgraduate Social\nVolunteering Accreditation\nDeputy President (Welfare)\nLiberation\nInternational students\nAccommodation\nProposed additions\nto remits\n\n"

I\u2019m\nhere to help you.\nRule number one: Don\u2019t get me killed.\nWait, where\u2019s your sword? Stick to the\ndarkness until you \ufb01nd it. Good thing\nyou were out cold, looks like they don\u2019t\nknow you\u2019re alive. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\nNow come on, we\u2019ve got to save Master\nAzai!\u201d\nAnd so opens Mark of the Ninja,\na 2D stealth game in which your superhuman senses are not the result of\ntraining or bloodline, but rather from\na powerful toxin injected into the skin.\nTattoos known as: he Marks.\nhe \ufb01rst level takes place at the tail\nend of an attack on your clan, led by a\nman named Karajan. Starting with only\nyour amazing senses, but picking up\nvarious pieces of equipment and learning new moves along the way, your goal\nis to assassinate him. his is a matter of\nhonour, however all may not be quite\nas it seems...\nhe controls are solid, though a little\nclunky if using keyboard and mouse.\nPersonally, I prefer to use an Xbox\n360 controller, occasionally using the\nmouse for precision, however a little\nbit of practice and most people should\nbe \ufb01ne with a keyboard and mouse.\nhe art and music, on the other hand,\nare absolutely astonishing. Together\nwith a few major features in the gameplay (being able to \u2018see\u2019 sound, pausing time for short periods, the sheer\nnumber of di\ufb00erent ways to execute\na stealth kill), these cause a very powerful atmosphere in the game. If, like\nme, you\u2019re one of these people who\nbecomes very invested in a game, you\nmight even start feeling like a real ninja.\nUnfortunately, there are very few\ngames out there to compare this to \u2013\n2D stealth games have only really started becoming popular with the release\nof Mark of the Ninja. However, in comparison to 3D stealth games two things\nshould be noted.\nFirstly that the game is more \u2018casual\u2019\n,\nin that it\u2019s much easier to get into. If\nyou simply want to complete the levels and \ufb01nish the story, you can fail all\nthe time and be detected quite often\nbut still complete it \u2013 only your points\nwill su\ufb00er. But if you want to, there\u2019s a\nwealth of secondary objectives to complete that turn it from a game that\nanyone can complete to one\nthat few can master.\nSecondly, it is also far\nless tedious; in my experi-ence, many stealth games\nhave a large element of wait-ing. Whilst this is indeed\npresent here, guard patrols are short, in order to\nminimise the wait. Rushing through a level\nwill still get you\ndetected and\ndecrease your\npoints, however you\noften need\nnot wait\nlong ,\na n d\n\u201c\nH\nGAMES\nFRIDAY 31 MAY 25\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you\u2019ve been living under a rock\nthese last two weeks, there was a lot of\nhype, building up to the reveal of Microsoft\u2019s latest console \u2013 the last real\ncontender in the latest saga of the console wars. As with anything that has\never had that much anticipation built\nup for it, you could hear the joy leaving everyone\u2019s souls, making the noise\nlike a rudely deflating balloon animal.\nIt turns out that most people\u2019s worst\nfears had become manifest.\nhere were rumours abound, regarding the name of the new console,\nand it looks like the community came\nup with a better name and branding\n(Xbox In\ufb01nity) for the console, than\nwhatever name Microsoft eventually picked out of a hat. So, we\u2019ve now\ngot the WiiU, PS4 and now the Xbox\nOne (now forever known to the Felix\ngames team as the XBone), so yeah.\nReally inventive names, people. You\u2019ve\npushed the boundaries of thought,\nby incrementing your console name\nby one, adding a letter and wilfully\nconfusing people with your \ufb01rst con-sole, respectively. What happened to\nthe time when we had names such as\n\u2018Dreamcast\u2019 and \u2018Gamecube\u2019? Heck,\nI\u2019d even accept mixing random words\nand letters to get new names, like the\n\u2018AssPlayer 128\u2019 or \u2018Screaming Eagle X\u2018,\nas that would at least be a less-half-assed attempt. Wow, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d\nmoan about the names for that long.\nSo yeah, onto the real disappointment.\nApparently, everyone in the world\nwatches TV, or they\u2019ll die \u2013 a school\nof thought founded by TV Licensing,\nand now adopted by Microsoft. Now,\nthat\u2019s not to say that Netflix, etc aren\u2019t\npopular, but trying to advertise your\nconsole because you can watch TV on\nit is... well... that\u2019s just stupid. hat\u2019s\nwhat a TV is for.\nUnusable gimmicks aside, Kinect is\nrequired for the console to even boot,\nso in other word... oh right, unusable\ngimmick. Well, I started so I might as\nwell let myself \ufb01nish. Kinect will always be on, and watching your room\n\u2013 your supposed to use Kinect commands to turn on your XBone. So, in\nother words, Microsoft will now have\na way to watch and record everything\nthat\u2019s going on in your room. Germany and Australia, the stalwarts of sen-sible-thinking, are debating banning\nthe console in their countries, due to\nthe ma-hu-ssive privacy concern.\nMuch hilarity could be had with other people\u2019s XBones, if the announcement ceremony was anything to judge\nthe Kinect by. Internet denizens reported that their Kinect-equipped\nXbox 360s turned o\ufb00 whenever the\npeople at the event gave commands\nto their on-stage XBone. Be ready for\npeople using in-game chat to direct\nyour XBone to lemonparty or goatse\n(Google at your own risk). Also, using\nyour Xbox to watch the reveal of it\u2019s\nsuccessor is just cruel.\nDRM is back for another round,\nThe consolation prize? Nah, you can keep it.\nRoss Webster Miss Universe 1908\nwhere now Microsoft has you bent\nover a barrel, and you\u2019re still begging\nfor more. No backwards compatibility with previous games, and games\nare tied to your Xbox Live account\n(like WiiU games, but we\u2019re bashing Microsoft today). Microsoft has\nmentioned creating a monopoly on\nthe used-game market, where you can\ngive up your license of \u2018Game A\u2019, to get\na discount on \u2018Game B\u2019 \u2013 the sequel to\nGame A, with nothing changed apart\nfrom a new weapon, which we\u2019ll nerf\non release\u2019. So yeah, good luck with\nthat Microsoft. We\u2019ll be watching.\nAnd silently judging.\nthere is nearly always something you\ncan do in the meantime to maximise\nyour chances of a successful stealth kill.\nOverall, Mark of the Ninja is a testament to what a group of programmers\ncan do when they have a singular vision and the time and money to do the\nbest they can at ful\ufb01lling that vision.\nMark of the Ninja is available on\nSteam or Xbox live for \u00a312, and a single DLC will be released over the\nsummer, expanding a little on\nthe backstory and introducing new items.\nXBone is watching\nyou sleep. It enjoys it.\nThe sequel, Simon of the\nNinja, coming Fall 2013\n\n"

I do this quite\na lot. Justin Bieber did that once in\nAmsterdam, but the less said about\nthat the better. So I guess I shouldn\u2019t\nhave said it all then.\nAnyway, even though there may be\na great museum on my doorstep, it\u2019ll\ntake me years to go there \u2013 a good\nexample is the V&A, which I \ufb01rst\nstepped into after being in London\nfor a whole four and a half years, not\nto mention the fact that I walked past\nit on a daily basis.\nI recently went to the British Museum. I may have been before when\nI was younger, but if I had then I certainly don\u2019t remember it. Everything\nabout the place is impressive. he\nmajestic architecture of the building is the \ufb01rst thing to strike you. It\u2019s\ndetail and size is just awe-inspiring.\nOnce you move inside, you realise\njust how much there is to explore. If\nyou like to go around reading every\nbit of information and looking at\neach individual item in a museum,\nthen good luck to you here: there\u2019s so\nmuch on o\ufb00er that you may end up\nhaving to live there for a year.\nhe Rosetta Stone is one of the\nmost famous attractions. In the \ufb02esh,\nwell, stone, it\u2019s incredible. he Rosetta Stone is what allowed us to understand hieroglyphs. Inscribed on it\nis a decree from King Ptolemy V in\nthree di\ufb00erent scripts: Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Ancient Egyptian\nDemotic script, and Ancient Greek.\nHaving actually learnt Ancient Greek\nfor two years at school, which on re\ufb02ection was probably an odd choice;\nit was a particularly fascinating experience for me. Although my knowledge of the language may not extend\nfar past knowing the phrase for \u201cunder the tree\u201d it was fun to have a stab\nat translating it. Be warned though,\nthere will be an army of tourists with\nvarious di\ufb00erent cameras constantly\nsnapping away.\nhe British Museum houses many\nancient ruins. Amongst the most\nimpressive of these are the Parthenon sculptures. Countless other ancient civilizations are explained with\nstructures exhibited. From China to\nthe Babylonians, it\u2019s all on display in\nsome form. here are extensive exhibitions on the Far East that have\nmany beautiful items and interesting\nexplanations.\nWhen walking through the Ancient\nMiddle Eastern structures, the size\nof some of the statues that survived\nfrom temples and palaces makes you\nwonder how they were built \u2013 at the\ntime they were constructed modern\nmachinery was still literally thousands of years away.\nhis being a newspaper, it should\nalso be noted that the history of\nwriting was particularly interesting.\nHow writing changed and evolved\nfrom early writing and cuneiform to\nwhat we see today is astounding. he\nthought that is most difficult to get\nyour head around is that, at one point\nwriting did not even exist.\nhe British Museum is in the heart\nof London.

You\u2019d think given this is my personal highest achievement at the Polo Nationals in the last\n5 years that I\u2019d have managed to get it\nout quickly. But no, life and, more an-noyingly, work goes on. However, as we\nclose in on our trip to the summer edition of the Polo Nationals in early June I\nhave \ufb01nally managed to sit down (at the\npub) and whip my laptop out antiso-cially to write up my hazy recollections\nof a cold weekend in February and what\nlooks from the outside like an industrial estate a little outside of Rugby which\nis, in fact, a polo ground.\nImperial this year managed to beg,\nborrow or steal enough cars so that\nmost of us could rock up under our\nown steam fairly easily with just one\nmedic having to join us via the train late\non the \ufb01rst day. However, by this stage\nour beginners, already irate about pre-tournament politics interfering with\ntheir fun, had to swallow their anger\nand hop on ponies sporting their very\nfetching ICU Lions polo shirts kindly\nsupplied by the Polo Bar at Rydges Hotel Kensington. I should probably point\nout what these \u201cpolitics\u201d were. Invariably any sport involving horse lovers\n(a pretty nutty breed of person at the\nbest of times) will bring out the worst\nin people. And where a slight mixup\nwith the division entries meant that we\nwere relying on another team to do the\ndecent thing and swap with us. It all\nlooked sorted for some time until the\npresident of a large student polo club,\nbased in the capital and comprising a\nnumber of di\ufb00erent universities (that\nshall remain nameless), kicked up a fuss\nand destroyed the whole thing leaving\nus stuck in Beginner 1a. Suddenly worried about the safety of my players in a\ngroup that would include a number of\nteams far more con\ufb01dent on horseback\nthan them I watched with my heart in\nmy mouth as they took on Portsmouth.\nhis is where my memories start to\nget hazy. Which, while I would like to\nblame it on the intervening time, is\nprobably due to the fact that most of\nmy cheering time was spent with a pint\nin my hand. Despite a few hairy moments when I thought one of my play-ers, Mike, might make an unceremonious exit from his pony, Midnight knows\nhis job well and gave Mike the sort of\nsmooth and forgiving ride he needed\nand to the sound of one embarrassingly\nloud cheer from me Imperial managed\nto pull ahead to an early lead. he chukka continued, hard fought and scrappy,\nwith Portsmouth scoring two and Imperial managing to increase their tally\nto stay in touch. With the game being\nonly 7 minutes long and 4 goals already\nscored everything looked set for a draw\nand then eventually the more con\ufb01dent\nriding of the Portsmouth girls took it\u2019s\ntoll and they pulled ahead for a 3-2 vic-tory. Never underestimate how good at\nriding girls from Portsmouth are.\nI should introduce the rest of the\nteam. But our number 3 thinks that\npolo is an embarrassing sport that\nmight get her teased by her friends\nfor being posh. As a girl who\u2019s favourite word (and nickname) is \u201cShan\u2019t\u201d I\ndoubt any of her friends were in any\ndoubt as it was. Marina on the other\nhand \ufb01nished up the team of three, another tiny little blonde girl. \u201cShan\u2019t\u201d got\no\ufb00 of Cura with some mixed feelings\nabout the match; many people say that\n90% of polo is your horse and while I\nthink at our level things tend to swing\nback to our incompetence making the\ngreatest di\ufb00erence it\u2019s true that if you\nand your pony don\u2019t get on you will just\nbe out of it with no way to get back.\nStill, with a change sorted for match 2\nthey headed swiftly out to play again\nagainst Warwick (a team with a reputation for dominating the Beginner divi-sions). Again our guys held their own\nbut just couldn\u2019t compete and it was a\nvery disheartened Beginner group that\nleft the yard that evening, however with\nintentions for having a decent night of\ndrinking in the pub.\nUnfortunately, at this stage my memories really do get hazy, though I do\nremember I ate a huge meal that was\nfar too large for any sane person. It did\ngive me a chance to get back to the polo\non Friday morning. Myself, Jon and Olivia were in the prestigious Novice 1\ndivision and were pretty excited to see\nwhat we could do when we got on. I\ncan\u2019t for the life of me remember who\nwe played in our \ufb01rst round match,\nit may have been Portsmouth again,\nhowever I do remember the score: 6-0.\nWe pretty conclusively smashed them\ninto the ground. Jon went on a spree of\ngoals and after the \ufb01rst throw in I think\nthey only made it over the half way line\nonce from a free hit before we were\nback after them. Trying hard not to let\nthe score line go to our heads we waited\nfor match 2. Against the much more\nworrying Cambridge team involving\na player well known to us as someone\nthat has played at the level above\u2026 but\nthen so have both me and Jon before\nnow so we were aware we\u2019d have to\n\ufb01ght hard.\nhings did not go well with us starting behind and me at the back having\nto \ufb01ght o\ufb00 strong attack after strong at-tack. Jon and Olivia managed to mount\nplenty of attacks of their own keeping us in contention and winning us a\npenalty to keep the scores level. hese\nhave been our Achilles\u2019 heel in the past\nand my heart was racing as I lined up\nto take it, my words from a few days\nbefore ringing in my ears; \u201cI\u2019ve never\nscored a penalty in an arena match\nbefore\u201d\n. he match ended 3 apiece and\ndread set in as we realised we were going to be penalties for the match and\nJon and Olivia both agreed that I would\nbe up \ufb01rst. If I recall correctly we ac-ICU Riding and Polo celebrate victory at the Arena Polo Nationals\nLions Rampant at Polo Nationals\ntually got through a full round of penalties and were still tied, but it was all\nover shortly after with the \ufb01rst penalty\nof sudden death making the di\ufb00erence.\nWe were through to the top four.\nhe Beginners were enjoying a day\no\ufb00 and slowly resolving to enjoy their\n\ufb01nal chukkas no matter what. Takeaway Chinese and plenty of drinks at\nour B&B were the order of the evening\nas we were all a bit knackered for the\npub. Plenty of banter ensued and while\nI was just about okay the next morning I somewhat assume that some of\nthe others were a little the worse for\nwear come Saturday, even if they didn\u2019t\nlet on. A match each on Saturday left\nthe beginners happier with a nil-nil\ndraw where they were competitive the\nwhole way through, yet still not the vic-tors. Perhaps my most fun match of\nthe nationals was against Sterling that\nafternoon despite a couple of notably\ndodgey moments. A harsh call against\nus led to a 2-0 de\ufb01cit in the \ufb01rst minute.\nAnd Sterling were by no means going\nto let us get it back easily, challenging\nour goal several more times, stopped\nonce primarily by a player tumbling o\ufb00\nof his pony practically underneath our\nponies. Still, we were quickly getting\ngoals back and my overriding memory\nof the chukka is a moment galloping\ndown the pitch where an opponent\nlight hearted asked Jon if he would ever\nstop appealing for fouls and I had the\ntime to reply that it seemed extremely\nunlikely. he match ended 4-2 in our\nfavour and the Sterling lads were extremely gracious in their defeat despite\nmutterings before the match about our\nteam being \u2018unfair\u2019\n.\nhe penultimate night of any given\npolo tournament is usually a fairly\nmessy players party. And this Saturday\nwas no di\ufb00erent. I think I saw more of\nJon\u2019s flesh than I ever needed to and\nsome cunning individual came up with\nthe remarkably pretentious idea of the\n\u201cChampager Bomb\u201d\n. Which, for anyone that likes the idea of Champagne\nand Jagermeister tastes absolutely foul\nby all accounts. Something about us\nmeans Imperial seem to always have\na 9am chukka on Sunday and as such\nthe beginners were on relatively good\nbehaviour; the same cannot be said\nfor Jon, though he continues to claim\nhe was actually ill on Sunday not ridiculously hung over. Still, my team\nspirit remained more or less intact and\nI did manage to blearily watch the beginners starting up this year\u2019s London\nDerby against ULU. Much as I\u2019d have\nliked to work up some proper rivalry at\n9am slightly hung over it is hard to do\nanything but club together and generally cheer everyone on. Our guys put\nup a good showing, with even the ULU\nspectators admitting that there was a\nvisible di\ufb00erence from them on day 1.\nHowever, as close as they kept it our\nbeginners went down 2-1 to claim the\nunfortunate wooden spoon.\nAll hope of redeeming ourselves then\nrested on the Novices and a \ufb01nal with\nour training partners and good friends\nOxford Brookes. Much as in the warm\nup arena we were all happy to crack a\nfew jokes with Sophie, Georgie and\nSaul it was clear that every one of us\nwanted it badly. he chukka was close,\nphysical and scrappy; both teams happy\nto muscle in and ruin each other\u2019s play\nrather than allow anyone a real chance\nto make flowing runs up and down the\npitch. Frustration started to set in as a\nfewobviousfoulsgotmissedbytheum-pire and with the clock counting down\nBrookes were ahead by one. A last foul\nagainst Jon, adding to his already splitting headache, gave us a penalty from\n25 yards and a \ufb01nal chance to level the\nscore and we sent it home comfortably\ndespite the pressure.\nSo the \ufb01nal eventually came down\nyet again to penalties and with us up\n\ufb01rst we put the pressure on, putting\nyet another against the backboard and\nlaying to rest our demons (the usually\nunreliable nature of Imperial penal-ties). Georgie Bolton lined up to try to\nequalise. She struck it well but low and\nthe ball bobbled slightly to the left, then\nslightly more and eventually caught the\nwall just wide. It took a few seconds to\nrealise that these penalties were sudden death before the elation hit and we\nknew we were taking home a national\nchampionship title. Alongside a pretty\nhefty trophy Jon managed to pick up\nthe Novice MVP award and we all went\nhome on a high. Time now for the summer version playing on grass and hopefully a tournament that isn\u2019t quite so\ncold and wet!\n\n"

All\nwork was co-ordinated in context of\nthe \u2018Global Challenges\u2019 \ufb01eld of Imperial Horizons. heir success manifests\nthe core skill bases championed by\nImperial Horizons tutors; many hope\nthat it will mark the inception of more\nfuture success related to the ancillary\ncourses.\nhe project took place over an eight\nweek time frame. he students were\nessentially left to their own devices, being required to assimilate a system for\nsolving a problem a\ufb00ecting An Minh,\nVietnam. he students proved that\nthey were commensurate to the task\nby hypothesising their own question\nand then creatively solving it. While\nthe project required a signi\ufb01cant component of Engineering the organisers\nstress those team players from non-Engineering disciplines were invalu-able, contributing to the cohesion that\ndelivered success in competition. Two\nPhD students mentored and channelled the e\ufb00orts of the students, liaising with the teams to construct a\nportfolio recording the design process.\nRaunaq Bagchi, one of the students\nthat competed, said: \u201che Engineers\nWithout Borders Challenge has been\na great exercise from the start. he\nprocess of coming up with ideas and\nrunning through all the possibilities\nto try and design the best solution\nfor people in other parts of world, is\na great way to open one\u2019s eyes to the\ntroubles many face. Now entering the\n\ufb01nal stages of the competition, I would\nsay it\u2019s a bonus and an opportunity to\nsee how our designs appeal to experts\nin the \ufb01eld.\u201d\nhe fruits of their labour were presented to judges at the national competition and as mentioned above three\nof the four teams will proceed to the\nFinals. he dominant team from each\nuniversity is entitled to a place with\nseven additional places awarded based\non merit. As cited by one Imperial Horizons member of sta\ufb00,\n\u201cIt is\u2026an outstanding achievement\nthat in our \ufb01rst year of running the\nChallenge we have managed to take\ntwo of those additional seven places.\u201d\nAs well as the competition the students will be o\ufb00ered opportunities to\nparticipate in \u2018innovative\u2019 workshops\nthat seek to convey living conditions in\nAn Minh and how the local community will bene\ufb01t from the endeavours\nof the students.\nCongratulations are in order for the\nfollowing individuals (see box), who\nhave served as remarkable ambassadors for Imperial College London and\nhighlight the potential of the intellectual arsenal imparted to students while\nstudying at the university.\nImperial Horizons extended an invitation to anyone interested in next\nyear\u2019s Engineering Without Borders\ncompetition \u2013 it is required that they\nenrol for the \u2018Global Challenges: Engineers Without Borders Challenge\u2019 on\nthe website enrolment page.

Isa Abdur\nRahman (pictured), 26, was a medical student at Imperial and was killed\nwhile helping the British charity\nHand In Hand for Syria (HIHS).\nDr Rahman was from North West\nLondon and was married. He had put\nhis medical career in the UK on hold\nto help the civilians hurt by the con\ufb02ict in Syria.

Fifteen\nFellwanderers packed into the minibus with all their kit secured on the\nroof and tents, gas stoves, ice axes,\nthe beast pot and more as well. After a\nlengthy stop in North London to \ufb01ght\nwith a tyre inflating compressed air\nmachine we sped up the M1 \u2013 which\nhad enough snow to convince us we\nwere already in Scotland \u2013 and on to\nthe M6, stopping at Birmingham for a\ngreasy spoon fried breakfast. Passing\nthe Peaks and Lakes we soon crossed\nthe border and stopped for a break at\nGretna Green village, stocking up at\nthe Cadbury factory outlet store. he\njourney continued between the tower\nblocks and industrial sprawl of Glasgow up to the beautiful Loch Lomond\nand beyond into the Highlands. As the\ngale force side-winds lashed the bus\nwe were all speechless, either from the\nbeautiful scenery or the ruined van\nand coach that had seemingly been\nripped from the road and rolled into\nthe frozen lake to our side. To ease the\njourney we \ufb01lled the bus with a half\nweek\u2019s food and continued under the\nveil of darkness, blissfully ignorant of\nthe perilous conditions outside, arriving safe and sound at 11.45pm.\nhe Bothy (constructed \u2018on a budget\u2019 with solid stone walls and a meagre hardwood ceiling beneath sheet\nmetal to ensure e\ufb03cient heat loss)\nnestles itself on the shores of Little\nLoch Broom, in the wee village of\nBadrallach, which was comfortably\nenjoying a sub-zero yet sunny and\ndry climate.\nSunday morning we rose early\nmunching granola and drinking tea,\nwith a tantalising view of the snow\ncapped An Tealach massif across\nthe Loch basking in sun. We walked\nfrom the Bothy climbing the ridge\nimmediately behind us which formed\na peninsula spiking towards the Atlantic ocean. We summited both\nCnoc a\u2019 Bhaid-rallach (544m) and\nBeinn Ghobhlach (635m), escaping\nthe harsh winds to enjoy a sandwich\npicnic huddled between some rocks.\nWe strolled down to Scoraig Village,\nwhich is accessed by boat across the\nLoch (no road); some 50 people live\nthere, with well-drawn water, electricity from windmills, and neat little houses where phone and TV signals do not reach\u2026 a real contrast to\nLondon. We wandered back around\nthe coast to our new home for a slice\nof Hello Kitty cake and then a classic cheesy chorizo pasta meal with\na few beers. here was a good sized\ntable and chairs to eat around but we\nwere a bit cosy with 15 squeezed in,\nthough the comfy sofa and roaring\n\ufb01re kept us happy. After hot showers\nit was time for bed, where two sleeping bags was the only way to keep\nwarm!\nMonday we were hungry to enter the mountains, hiking from Camusnagul up to Glas Mheall Mor\n(979m Munro Top) with a snowy\nscramble to the summit, then epic\nviews to the spikes of the Munros\nbeyond. We crossed the valley before\nheading up Sail Mhor (767m) with\npanoramic views of the mountains\nbehind and the islands and sea in\nfront. hai green stir-fry and cherry\npie for dinner. Tuesday we journeyed\ninland to Iverlael Bridge (on A835)\nclimbing the snowy ridge up to the\nwhite-out that was Eididh nan Clach\nGeala (927m Munro), slowly picking\nour way down the icy decent we had\nlunch by the frozen fords and then\nretreated down the valley via Loch\nan Chnapalch. A delicious beef curry\nwith rice and naan was prepared at\nthe bothy and much fun was had.\nWednesday was a rest day for most,\nsome basked in the sun with books\nat the bothy, others made a tour of\nthe highlands, visiting gorges, water-falls, distilleries, the glorious Morray\nFellwanderers Chill Out for Easter\nJack Redvers Harris\nFellwanderers President\nFellwanderers Easter Tour to the Snowy Scottish Highlands\nFirth suspension bridge and picking\nup some shopping in the bleak city of\nInverness. Others took a walk from\nnr.

A delicious pork and dumplings meal was\nprepared with trifle for dessert over\nwhich many tales of old where told.\nhursday we enjoyed a hearty fry-up breakfast, fuelling folks with en-ergy. One group climbed from Torran Dubh (on A835) up to Beinn\nLiath Mhor Fannich (954m Munro)\nvia Creag Dhubh Fannich, returning via Beinn Laith Bhearg (664m).\nMeanwhile another group undertook\nan epic journey passing the back of\nAn Tealach down to the shores of\nLoch na Sealga and back. After a\nbrisk dip in the icy sea loch and a\nspot of tea and cake at the bothy, a\ntraditional Scottish dinner of Haggis\nwith potato mash and swede was had\nin the evening, with many an ale and\ncheesecake for dessert.\nFriday we woke at 5am to pack\nand leave at 7am, driving over three\nhours North along \u201cA roads\u201d which\nconsisted of single-track roads with\noccasional passing places, to reach\nBen Hope, the most Northerly Munro. We eagerly marched from sea\nlevel up the long ride to summit Ben\nHope (927m Munro), before whiteout set in and we found our way back\ndown the snow to the sunny valley,\nbefore bundling back in the minibus\nfor a long journey home. We left the\nvalley at 4pm, stopped for dinner in\nPerth at 8pm and returned to London for 7am.\nMAPS\nDay 1-2: OS Explorer 435 An Teallach and Slioch\nDay 3-5: OS Explorer 436 Beinn\nDearg and Loch Fannich (Ul-lapool)\nDay 6: OS Explorer Ben Hope\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n19\nFRIDAY 31 MAY\nCassette Culture: RRR Records\nRiaz Agahi talks to Ron Lessard, head of seminal noise label RRR\nA\nfter hearing about RRR\nrecords through their\nRecycled series, I discovered a contribution\nto the development and\nproliferation of noise music that goes\nfar beyond a series of tapes which\nbrings together some of noise\u2019s most\nimportant artists. Based in Lowell,\nMassachusetts, RRR has the distinction of being the \ufb01rst American label to release Merzow, e\ufb00ectively\nglobalising noise. Despite that, the\nlabel\u2019s pro\ufb01le is lower than Merzbow\nand the like, and this is because rather\nthan sticking with the artists it helped\nestablish, the label has relentlessly focused on new discoveries. his is RRR\nrecords\u2019 truly underground ethos,\nwhich I felt worthy of further exami-nation, so I got in touch with label\nfounder and head Ron Lessard.\nRiaz Agahi: What motivated you to\nstart RRR?\nRon Lessard: I\u2019ve been passionate\nabout record albums since I was a\nteenager, it\u2019s a passion that grew into\nan obsession \u2013 opening a record store\nwas the natural direction for my life,\nit\u2019s the one thing I always cared about\n\u2013 y\u2019know that old saying about \ufb01nding\nwhat you love in life and you\u2019ll never\nhave to work again? Well, it\u2019s true \u2013\nI followed my passion and that\u2019s the\nbest thing anyone could ever do.\nRA: How did you get in touch with\nJapanese artists like Merzbow and\nAube?\nRL: I didn\u2019t get in touch with them,\nthey got in touch with me \u2013 back in\nthe day when there was no \u201cscene\u201d, it\nwas just a bunch of us guys who traded\ntapes with one another, there used to\nbe a number of fanzines and publications that promoted tape trading and\nthose guys read about me in a magazine somewhere. I was the American\nguy who understood what they were\ntrying to do so they said hello.\nRA: What is it about the cassette that\u2019s\nmade it so heavily a part of the noise\nscene?\nRL: At the time, internet didn\u2019t exist\nand making records for that weird\nrecording you made last night was\ntotally out of the question. Cassettes\nwere cheap, you could buy them anywhere and most importantly, you\ncould make them yourself at home \u2013\nand because of that, cassettes was the\nmedium of choice.\nDigital technology has changed the\nway noise gets disseminated but that\noriginal cassette camaraderie still exists and it seems to be getting stronger \u2013 cassette labels are popping up left\nand right \u2013 I totally understand the\nlove for cassettes, it\u2019s the need for human connection \u2013 clicking a button to\nhear something on your computer is\nswell but it could never match the appeal of getting something in the mail\nthat someone made just for you.\nRA: How did the recycled series come\nabout and do you have any personal\nhighlights?\nRL: Most labels put out cassette after cassette of the same people \u2013 I\nwanted to do just 1 cassette by everyone \u2013 as a theme/direction for this\nconcept, I decided instead of original\nworks by these artists, I would ask\nthem to recycle their own or someone\nelse\u2019s recordings (recycling is remix-ing, tearing it down and rebuilding\nit) \u2013 I would then take those recycled\nrecordings and record them over preexisting cassettes \u2013 that Twisted Sister tape got taped over by Merzbow,\nthe Billy Joel tape is now an Aube\ntape.\nI no longer ask the artist to make\ntheir master based on recycling/re-mixing \u2013 I\u2019m happy to accept new\noriginal material \u2013 I no longer ask\nwell known and successful artists to\nparticipate in the series, I try to only\nrelease the unknown, unloved, unac-complished \u2013 the new recruits, those\nwho are just beginning their noise\njourney \u2013 I see no reason to support\nthose who are already successful, they\nalready have their support mechanism in place \u2013 the unknown, unloved\nhave no one who cares and that\u2019s why\nI want to use this series as a support\nmechanism for the new recruits\nhere was a time when the noise\nscene didn\u2019t exist, everyone was unloved and unaccomplished \u2013 but\nwhen we found each other, we knew\nwe had to support each other \u2013 now\nthe noise scene exists but it sill has the\nunloved and unaccomplished \u2013 they\nget my full support, I remember what\nit was like when no one cared.\nRA: How do you feel the noise scene\nhas evolved since the beginning and is\nit for better or for worse?\nRL: Well, the big di\ufb00erence is the\nnoise scene actually exists now \u2013\nthere was a time when only the artists\nknew each other and the information\nwas hard to get out, now the information is easy to get out, it happens\nevery second of every day \u2013 and now\nthere are so many people who listen to\nnoise for their own personal pleasure,\nit no longer revolves around those\nwith the NEED to make noise \u2013 it has\nbecome an acceptable form of expression and because of that, you have to\ntake the good and the bad.\nRA: Kind of a more general question\nis about the origins of noise as a genre.\nhere were academics like Luigi Russolo at the start of the 20th century\nwho promoted it as an idea, as kind of\nthe next step in the evolution of music\nbecause the human ear had become\nadjusted to the noise of the urban industrial environment. But then on\nthe other hand, there\u2019s more anarchic\ngenres like punk and grind, which\nseem more organic in their approach.\nDo you feel it\u2019s a combination of both,\nor one in particular or something else\nentirely?\nRL: I was listening to the academics before punk and grind were even\ngenres \u2013 and many of the original\nnoise guys did also \u2013 me personally,\nI never read that Russolo manifesto,\nI don\u2019t care about the theory, I only\nreally care about the results \u2013 does it\nspeak to me, does it covey a mood or\nexpression that I can identify with \u2013\nall the theory in the word ain\u2019t gonna\nmake me like it, that\u2019s just some guy\ntrying to explain himself.\nI can certainly appreciate the organic approach, those guys make noise\nbecause their passion compels them\n\u2013 I love those guys, its all about bare-ing your soul.\nRA: As kind of an extension of the last\nquestion, how important is industrial?\nI\u2019m not a fan of industrial, it sounds\ntoo much like people singing songs\nGX Jupitter-Larson (of he Haters) said it best... \u201cIndustrial is singing about \ufb01re, Power Electronics is\nscreaming about \ufb01re, Noise is starting\nyour own \ufb01re.\u201d\nRA: Merzbow once said that Western\nnoise was too academic, do you feel\nthat there\u2019s major di\ufb00erences in noise\nfrom each country?\nRL: Everyone has their own ideas and\nperceptions \u2013 some countries do have\ntheir own identity of sorts, no doubt\ndue to their cultural environment:\nEngland \u2013 big on power electronics\nGermany \u2013 big on power electronics\nJapan \u2013 big on noise\nUSA \u2013 big on noise\nMake of that as you will, I won\u2019t\nmake any judgements.\nRA: his doesn\u2019t really have anything\nto do with the interview, but I got this\ncassette single with my recycled tapes\nthat said Autraumatic on the side,\nwasn\u2019t sure what this was but it was a\npretty great tape.\nRL: Actually this has everything to\ndo with the interview because it goes\nback to my wanting to support the\nnew recruits \u2013 I don\u2019t remember that\ncassette but I\u2019m in the habit of giving\naway cassettes by unknown artists\nwhenever I get an order \u2013 it\u2019s another\nway I support the unloved and uncared\u2026.\nRA: Are there any new artists on\nyour label you\u2019d especially recom-mend?\nRL: Ha! - all of them.\nBuy RRR music from http://www.\nrrrecords.com/\nTo hear John Wiese\u2019s entire recycled\ntape, visit http://www.icradio.com/\nschedule/228491\n\n"

Isa tried to emulate the qualities of the\nprophet by devoting his youth, health, rich-ness, time and, ultimately, life, for the sake of\nGod through humanitarianism. This beautiful example is particularly relevant in light\nof the tragedy that occurred in Woolwich\nearlier this month, showing how religion can\nbe and is a motivation towards beneficence.\nIsa left Britain to use his medical skills to save\nlives, and both his death and the death of\nDrummer Lee Rigby have brought sadness\nto a great many people. The Quranic verse\nrelated by Deputy PM Nick Clegg last week\nat a conference with Muslim leaders thus\nfeels particularly relevant: \u201cIf anyone kills a\nhuman being, it shall be as though he killed\nall mankind.

In addition, Isa actively organised tutorials and PotMed\nevents for the Muslim Medics society,\nas well as o\ufb00ering advice and guidance to younger students. He was also\na member of the Snooker and Book\nclubs at Imperial.\nIsa was described as a dedicated volunteer who strived for good and profoundly touched the hearts of many\npeople with his endeavours, and as a\ntrue inspiration to everyone \u2013 many\nwill deeply miss him. On behalf of\nthe ISoc at Imperial, the President,\nHazem El-Turk, commented: \u201cIsa was\nundoubtedly one of the most exceptional individuals to pass through\nour Society. His contribution to university life, as well as his passion and\ncommitment to issues beyond that\nare things that we remember him for\ntoday. Our thoughts are with his family in this difficult time, and we hope\nthat his sel\ufb02ess actions will inspire\nothers to engage more in humanitarian issues worldwide\u201d. Muslim Medics\nand the ISoc will be having a tribute\nto Isa later on in the year.\nAamir Shamsi, a 5th year medic\nat Imperial said that Isa was \u201ca great\nman and an elder brother to me.\u201d\nAamir went on to say: \u201cIsa\u2019s patience\nand wisdom was beyond doubt even\nat such a young age. He had a towering presence and was highly respected in the community but he was so\nmodest and humble that you would\nnever have realised his incredible\nachievements until someone told you.\nHe was and will continue to remain a\ngreat role model.\u201d\nHis friends set up a JustGiving page\nfor people to donate money for a new\n\ufb01eld hospital to be set up in his memory to continue his work. he original\nplan was for a new ambulance in his\nmemory. However, the \u00a37000 needed\nwas raised in fewer than 14 hours. His\nfriends said that the speed with which\nthe money was raised was \u201ca testament to the character of Isa and the\nbeauty of the people who know him\u201d.\nhe aim was changed to the more\nambitious target of setting up a \ufb01eld\nhospital, which would be named after Isa. In the last week, over \u00a350,000\nhas been raised, which means a \ufb01eld\nhospital in Syria can be set up after\nIsa and will be run by HIHS in his\nmemory.\nOn the Just Giving page, his friends\npaid tribute to him. hey said: \u201chose\nwho knew him personally, and those\nwho have heard of him, will know\nwhat an amazing, inspirational, kind\nand deeply-caring person he was. It\nis quite hard to know where to even\nbegin describing what an amazing\nperson he was, and all of us are still\nin shock.\u201d\nhe donations, which came in thick\nand fast, came with comments paying\ntribute to him. Anne Hinojosa said:\n\u201cI am so sorry to hear of the death of\nthis brave young man. What a beauti-ful, inspirational human being.\u201d Not\nall of the donations were from fellow\nOver \u00a350,000 donated for hospital in his honour\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nThe Royal Free\nHospital, where\nIsa worked\nbefore flying to\nSyria\nMuslims; some appeared to\nbe from people that did not\nknow him personally and/\nor are not Muslim. Anthony\nPage said: \u201cA brave man\u2026\nRespect\u2026 from an atheist.\u201d\nAt the time of going to print\nthere have been over 900\ndonations.\nDr Mahmoud al Akraa, a\nclose friend of Dr Isa, commented that \u201conce you met\nIsa you never forgot him. He\nwas so kind, so warm and so\nbrave. He had the respect of\neveryone and would do anything to help others in need.\nOne time one of the refugee\ncamps in Syria had cholera and no doctor would\ngo in, except Isa. He would\nrisk his life for others. He\nworked up until midnight\nand would treat hundreds of\npatients each day. He would\nthen sleep rough in a sleeping bag and often not wash\nfor days.\u201d\nThere is more information\non the \ufb01eld hospital being\nset up in his honour on the\nJustGiving page, where donations can be made: http://\nwww.justgiving.com/for-Isa\nNida Mahmud News Editor\nWhat religion truly\nmeans\nThe brave\nyoung doctor sacrificed\nhis life to save\nthe lives of\nothers and he\nwill be very\nsorely missed\nby the many\nfamily, friends\nand colleagues who\nknew him.\n\u201d\n\u201c\n\u201cEveryone who\nknew him is\nshocked and\nsaddened\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 31 MAY\n8\nIacopo Russo\nhen I found out\nthat my team\nhad made it to\nthe \ufb01nals of the\nEngineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge I was\nof course really pleased to know that\nall of our e\ufb00ort was actually worth it. I\nfeel really satis\ufb01ed because I think that\nif they chose us out of the 50 teams in\nthe UK and Ireland, this means the design portfolio and oral presentation we\nproduced were valuable and we actually managed to apply our (engineering)\nskills to a real problem successfully.\nI think there were mainly two good\nthings about the Horizons course I\ntook and the EWB Challenge in gen-eral: \ufb01rst, you get your hands on a real\nengineering problem and with the help\nof the data provided by EWB you have\nto come up with a solution that makes\nsense and takes into account all the\nvariables of the real world; second, you\nget to think about the problems the\nworld has from the perspective of the\nless fortunate, of the world\u2019s poorest,\nwho don\u2019t even have safe houses or access to clean water, so you widen your\npoint of view quite a lot and realise you\ncan actually do something to change\nthe situation.\nhis year, the challenge was to design an engineering solution for one\nof the many problems a\ufb00ecting a community in rural district of Vietnam, in\nthe Mekong Delta. My team decided to\nfocus on the \u201cHousing and Infrastructure\u201d design area: our objective was to\nimprove the design of the houses and\nbuildings this rural district so that they\ncould provide a safe sheler for the families against the threat of rising sea water levels, pests and extreme weather\nevents. During the eight weeks of the\ncourse, we learnt how to assess our\nstrengths and weaknesses (in terms\nof knowledge, skills, interests), how to\nbetter de\ufb01ne the question and how to\nchoose the best solution among a few\nthat we had come up with. he fact\nthat we are now in the \ufb01nals shows\nthat we probably managed to do this\npretty well!\nhe course was very well designed\n(especially if you consider it was the\n\ufb01rst time it had been run), and I think\nElizabeth [the member of sta\ufb00 at Imperial Horizons] did a very good job\nin matching the assessment criteria\nfor the Horizons course to those for\nthe national competition. his course\nwas actually special, in that it was both\norganised by Imperial (and so the \ufb01nal\nmark we got will go on our transcript,\nI think) and by EWB. We didn\u2019t have\nto do more work when submitting the\ndesign portfolio and the oral presentation to the competition because, as\nI said, the \u201cmarking scheme\u201d was the\nsame.\nI would recommend this course to\nnext year\u2019s \ufb01rst year students, as it\ngives you an insight into what they\ncall the global dimension: it helps putting your course and the things you\nstudy in the right perspective, thinking\nabout what the real problems that the\nworld faces today are and what we can\ndo about it. I also very much liked the\nfact that the cultural and social side\nof the issue was highly stressed: we\nlearnt that for a design solution to be\naccepted, it must be consistent with\nthe cultural and social characteristics\nof the community you are implementing it in. When you are dealing with\ncommunities whose culture is very different from the Western, this requirement becomes especially stringent. I\nguess this is the reason why the whole\nprogramme is called \u201cHorizons Global\nChallenges\u201d: it forces us to widen our\nperspective to include multiple points\nof view, because only in this way we\ncan understand each other even if we\nare from di\ufb00erent parts of the globe\nand work together to solve those\nproblems that can be solved only by a\ncommunal e\ufb00ort (see Climate Change,\nGlobal Poverty).\nSo yeah, the \ufb01nals are now a very\ngood opportunity for us to \ufb01nd out\nhow other teams from the UK have\napproached the issue and maybe learn\nsomething new about how we could\nimprove the way we have approached\nit. It will also be a good opportunity for\nus to con\ufb01rm that coming from a good\nengineering university means that we\ncan actually be quite good at solving\nengineering problems (in fact, we have\nthree teams in the \ufb01nals...)\nIacopo Russo discusses the benefits of taking part in the Engineers\nWithout Borders Challenge where he solved a real life problem\nEngineering a good course\nW\nFollow us @FelixComment\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLike us facebook.com/FelixComment\nSomething got you raging?

Due\nto the stresses of political life, MBs\nare able to claim back honey that is\nspent maintaining their two hives \u2013\none in their constituency, and another\nin London. hey are not allowed to\nclaim against their allowances, honey\nspent on any properties which they do\nnot live in.\nHowever, rumours spread on the\ninternet last year, over alleged em-buzzlement of honey, after photos\nwere released of Sir Edward Fuzzington-Stripes, meeting with a group of\nwasps. Upon confrontation, Sir Fuzzington-Stripes, aged 2 months, and 12\ndays, gave up a list of names of other\ninvolved parties.\nhis lead to the arrest of many MBs,\nalso on the charge of wax evasion,\nwhich holds a maximum prison sentence of 18 days.\nhis isn\u2019t the \ufb01rst time that Sir Fuzzington-Stipes has been caught in the\nspotlight either. Last May, a super-injuction was taken out to prevent the\nproliferation of photos of him, crawling out intoxicated, from the \ufb02ower\nbed of a Miss Givens of Bethnal Green,\nLondon. It didn\u2019t help his image, when\nlater, upon leaving Downing Street, he\nwas heard to mutter \u2018fucking drones\u2019\nas he was ushered through a side gate.\nIn the light of this research, the government has suggest that we should\nlower the wax tax for the bees with\nthe most honey, to stop them from\nleaving the country. he paper, how-ever, does go on to say that trying to\nbribe bees to stay in this country, just\nto keep the honey \ufb02owing, is goddamn stupid.\nHangman\u2019s 2013 guide to getting some nerdy companionship\nDappy: \u201cTarzan\u201d\n\u201cEstate agent told me I can\u2019t be\nlate,\nWhen I turned up told her chat to\nmy briefcase\u201d\nSo were you late or not?
