Philosophy is split into two great camps \u2014\nthe idealist's who assert that thought 'is primary 'to matter and the materialists who say 'that ideas arise out of the material world in some way.\nIf you subscribe to Ithe for-mer, then .end of correspondence for your arguments will\nreduce to a question of god given morality, and your political position to one of fervent reaction.\nThe '\u00a9a rly materialists assented that changes in ideas\ncame about from 'changes in the material world, but of course could not explain the source of changes in Ithe\nmaterial world, and ascribed\nit (like the idealists in explaining the source of changes of ideas ' did 'to a god or 'third force iof some kind) to some constant law of Nature\u2014it just works that way!\nThese 'mechanical materialists were just another form of philosophical idealists, in having to look outside the material world for some source of changes in it.' Dialectical materialists( of which Marx was the first) say on the contrary( that ideas arise out of the struggle between Man and Nature \u2014 a struggle which changes both Man and the material world. From this we can 'see that there are no absolutes \u2014 no straight lines through historical development \u2014 just( con-tin u al conflict. Furthermore that the working. class can only 'develop\nspontaneously trade union, I.e. bou geo is reformist, consciousness and it is precisely to break the working class from reformism that we call for the election of Labour government, etc. The necessity for the party or more precisely a democratic centralist organisation( democratic to allow the ful lest discussion of ideas or abstractions from the' political situation and centralist to provide the greatest unity in carrying out the policies of the Party arising out of the discussion) is to provide the highest form of political leadership for i the masses. Y SSS class\" The role of the revolutionary party.\" Me ch.Eng.214, Wednesday,1 p.m. ENTS\nDear Ali,\nI should like to clear\nup a few misunderstandings which may have\narisen out of the 'Felix'\ncoverage of the U GM of\nOctober 16th regarding\nthe 'Ents Motion'.\nFirstly, the council\nmotion of last term was\namendment was proposed to allow Ents a little more freedom than\nthe (amended) Council\nMotion originally suggested. John Lane's amendment did not purport to \"increase the\nnumber of 'large\ngroups' to four per\nterm\"; it restricted the\nnumber of optional extra concerts to one,\nthe overall effect being\nto limit the number of\n\"large concerts\" to four\nper term.\nYour reporter has\nalso grossly misinterpreted the original\nCouncil motion. It was\npassed, not \" . . . . to\nensure Ents cater for a wider range of tastes\",\nbut rather, and I quote,\nthat \"I.C. Ents run\nevents to consist of\nWeekly Hops combining\nthe Friday disco and a' dance able' band. This\nto be run on Fridays or\nSaturdays as a social\nevent in the Union (Con-cert Halt) . . . No big\nconcerts in the Great\nHall in the first term\" (A subsequent amendment\naltered\" No\" to\n\"Three\").\nAt the time this motion was passed Ents\nhad already been running films for a term.\nThe \"Folk Groups\"\n(i.e. Ralph McTell, pre-sum ably) this term,\nhardly qualify under the\nabove stipulation and\nare, for the time being\nat least, being planned\nindependently of both\nthe \"Three Concert\nLimit\" and Ents. The\nmotivation to cater for\na wider range of tastes\nhas always existed in\nEnts and was not influenced by Council.\nThe attendance at\nTuesday's Osibisa concert suggests to me at\nleast that plenty of I.C. students are interested\nin what Ents is doing.\nSo can I encourage\neveryone who is inter-SOUP RUN\nFor the past year ICCAG have been doing a soup run to Charing Cross and surrounding\nareas. This happens each Wednesday and Friday night and involves taking soup and bread to\npeople who for various reasons have nowhere\nto go and are sleeping on the streets.\nThese are the people who have slipped through the net of the welfare state in what is meant\nto be a caring and compassionate society. Very\noften the only alternative to the street is alo used up Salvation Army Hostel or a vast impersonal Government Reception Centre, I know which I would choose. Most of the people at Charing Cross have social problems of one sort or an other, some have medical problems, while yet\nothers are purely and simply homeless. This\nmakes them unable to draw Social Security,\nthereby creating an unavoidable vicious circle. So what can we as students do about it all?\nThe most important achievement is to make personal contact with some of the\" dos s ers\" who\nso many people just pass by and ignore. It is\nsurprising how quickly individual relationships\ndevelop, especially for those who do soup run\non a regular basis.\nAs well as showing that we at least doc are and consider it a scandal and an outrage that in our society there are people sleeping on the pavement in front of showrooms housing cars, we\nmust aim to heighten people's awareness and rouse their consciences. If public opinion was\nsufficiently strong this appalling situation would no longer be tolerated and something would have to be done. It is people's attitudes that\nwe must try to change \u2014 after all it could happen to anyone of us. It's easy to end upon the street, but not so easy to get back off it.\nWell, this is what Soup Run is all about \u2014\njust seeing and talking to people. It doesn't take much \u2014 we are all human. Claire.\nSoup Run \u2014 Wednesday, 9.00, Selkirk Kitchen,\n10.00 Union Arch. Friday 10.00 Selkirk Kitchen,\n11.00 Union Arch.

Ents Chairman.\nIndia's human calculating\nmachine\nSHAKUNTALA DEVI\nSHAKUNTAL A DEVI was born in Bangalore,\nIndia in 1946. When she was three, she had a revelation that she was a mathematical genius. The revelation proved to be true, and even now, at the age of\n32, she is baffling everybody with her mathematical!\nprowess.\nAt six, Shakuntala demonstrated her 'talents ait the\nUniversity of Mysore to a large gathering of students\nand professors of the University. The little girl\nworked out the most complicated arithmetical manipulations with 'lightning rapidity and scientific pre-c is ion, and kept the assembly astounded for two\nhours.\nShakuntala who later displayed her talents to\npeople all over India came to be acclaimed as a child\nprodigy.\nIn London, on October 5th,1950 the BBC presented Shakuntala on TV. She gave quick answers to problems set by the B.B.C. She also gave a present at fon at Leeds University the next day.\nAt i the University of Rome, one of her answers\nwas found to be wrong by the calculating machine.\nAfter re-checking it was found that the calculator\nhad gone berserk.\nIn Washington,. D.C., the party of reporters and.\nmathematics professors who witnessed Iher demonstration in July 1952 were completely baffled. The audience of Dan Seymour's\" We the People\" TV show\nin New York witnessed Shakuntala compete with an electronic calculator and win by six seconds. She\nappeared on other shows in the U.S.A. Shakuntala also toured South America and the Far East. In Japan she appeared on the Nippon Television Network, and in Cambodia she gave a performance before H.H. the King of Cambodia.\nIn Sydney, Australia, Shakuntala matched her wits\nagainst an \u00a380,000 electronic brain \" UTE COM\" of the University of South Wales. Seconds before the\ncomplete question could be fed into \" UTE COM\", Shakuntala had the answers. \" It is frightening!\" remarked one of the professors present.\nShakuntala Devi has toured most of the countries\nexcept Russia and China and some in Eastern Europe.\nNowadays, she is in Britain. Recently she appeared,\non TV and also featured in i the daily newspapers.\nShe has challenged any computer or calculator to\na match of mathematical ability, while she is in Britain. Her record to date: Extracting Ithe 20th root of a42 digit number and multiplying figures\nthat yielded- a39 digit answer. Simple sums don't take any time at all. By \"simple\" she means calculating cube and fourth roots, etc.! She said modestly to\nthe Daily Mirror:\" For big problems like finding the\n10th root of a40 figure digit I have to concentrate\nhard and it might take up to 30 seconds to answer\"..\nRecently, the Sunday Times put her to the test,\nThey took her to the accounts department, where\nthere was a very bright girl with a deft hand on an.\nelectronic calculator. Shakuntala Devi won each time\nbecause her answers to a series of extensive addition,\nmultiplication and division were just about instantaneous; their girl hadn't had time to get them on the machine. There was no competition when it came\nto finding a fourth root: the machine couldn't do it.\nShakuntala took three seconds.\nSuch a display of brilliance is hardly credible.\nNevertheless, it is true. You too can witness the\nwizards at work. Shakuntala will be appearing at\nImperial College (Great Hall), on November 8th,1973, at 7.30 p.m. on invitation from I.C. India Soc,\nAdmission will be lOp. All are welcome.\nFurther information may be obtained from:\nM. Bhadresha, Elec. Eng. 3;\nor P. Chakrabarety, Chem. Eng. PG; or J.P. Singh, Mech.

    "content": "Pag\u00a9 6\nOctober 3(Nfe, 1973\nREVIEWS\nOsibisa\nBeing the first concert I 've reviewed\nfor quite some time, I expected it to be\nquite a difficult one, but it turned out\nnot to be the case in Osibisa.\nAll the music papers categorise their\nmusic under the term \" Afro Rock\", though this is a little vague. I would\nprefer to say that their music consists\nof a very driving rhythm, which is\nplayed, bursting with exuberance, on\nbass, keyboards and various percussion\ninstruments, which were dotted around\nthe stage. Superimposed on this are\nequally driving passages on brass. Dn the whole I found them very easy to\nlisten to, despite not having heard a great deal of their music beforehand.\nWhat did quite bewilder me was the\nsemi-hysteria they received from the\nmoment they were announced, and persisting throughout the evening. This was\nencouraged by the energy Osibisa were\ngenerating in turn enhancing audience\nparticipation, which was well supported,\nthough tended to drag on a little towards\nthe end.\nEarlier, Heavy Metal Kids had played\nsome fairly good and basic heavy rock,\nthis time to a rather unresponsive audi-enc e.G. J.K. Ron Geeson opened the evening with\na short set in which he was not put off\nby the bar racking and impatient part of\nthe audience tout countered the shouted\nremarks with equally witty comments.\nHe is a rather eccentric Scotsman whose\nMorcambesque antics with the banjo\nand piano (which he played very well),\nand several monologues (which he\nenunciates very clearly and precisely in\na rather sinister fashion), were very\namusing.\nGenesis were brilliant. The sound\nwas well mixed from a console in the\nmiddle of the stalls and the volume\nwas also used carefully and subtly. It\nwas not a continued mind-shattering\nblast but was gradually increased during the one and three-quarter hour per-form ance. The stage was backed by a white\ncloth screen onto which slides were projected during the songs. They helped to\naccentuate the music and illustrate the\nlyrics but on the whole were rather poor,\nthough the idea was good.\nThe production was excellent and\nexact. Genesis are a band whose music\nis as careful y structured as classical\nmusic and they reproduced their recorded material in the finest detail,\nright down to a recording of the two\nlittle boys singing the sinister nursery\nrhyme :\nn angelic and uncomprehending\nvoices.\nit could be said that there is lit tie point in going to hear music that you\nalready have on record. Well the answer\nis Peter Gabriel. The atmosphere he\ncreates with his literally fantastic cos-tu me, sinister dramatics and amusing\nintroductions had the audience tense\nand expectant for surprises which, when\nthey came, were original and effective.\n\"Watcher of the Skies\" opened, with\nbooks\nAdvertisement\nLast year, there was a cut-price record service,\noffering students a19% reduction, run in College by\nCotin McCall, and this year the service has been taken\nover by John Holloway (Computing I) and Steve Walker\n( Chem. Eng. II). The service will be run from the Room at The Top on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday\nLunchtimes (12.30\u20141.30), and any record can be\nordered. The 19% reduction is better than either Comet\nor Virgin Records mail orders can give.\nGenesis and\nRon Geeson at the Rainbow\na majestic and impressive introduction\nfrom Tony Bank's organ and synthesis-er. His playing is simple in form yet is\nvery effective and dramatic. During the\nconcert they mainly played songs from\ntheir latest album \"Selling England by\nthe Pound.\" These were 'Fifth of First\",\n'The Cinema Show\", \" The Battle of\nEpping Forest\" and \" More fool me\" which is a simple acoustic guitar number played by Michael Rutherford and\nwith Steve Hackett on vocals, whose\ndrumming I think plays a very important part in bringing the other instruments together and giving a definite\nrhythm to the music.\nThey finished with what is, I think,\ntheir best composition yet\u2014\"Supper's Ready\" from \"Foxtrot\". As the climactic organ solo \"began, Gabriel stood\nmotionless on the stage illuminated with\nultra-violet light wearing an orange\nluminous \"mask\"(?) (See cover of live\nalbum), then a loud explosion just before the return to the vocals revealed\nhim, when the smoke cleared, in a bright silver shirt in contrast to the black\nsuit that he had worn before.\nThen after nearly 10 minutes clap-ping, an encore, \" The Knife\" from\n\"Trespass\", with the whole audience on\nits feet.\nIt was a carefully thought out and\nrehearsed performance, the strong element of fantasy accentuated by the use\nof lighting, music, costume and makeup by Peter Gabriel plus excellent lead\nguitar work by Steve Hackett (often\nindistinguishable from the organ). These\nqualities of musicianship and stage production make Genesis one of the best\nlive bands in the country.\nStone groove man. A really heavy\nsap. .\nPALANT IRT ON. Small dreams of a scorpion by Spike Milligan Penguin 25p 'There comes a time in every man's life when he stops laughing and starts\nto grind under the yoke of contemporary pressures. . . . The result of this\nchange in personality is found within\nthe confines of this book.\"\nThese words from Milligan's own introduction to this slim volume of (very)\nserious poetry goes a long way to explaining their existence. Spike has always been the campaigner, from wild\nlife preservation to the cure of mental\nillness. No wonder then that the serious\nside of his character should express itself\nin a creative form as well as the comic\nside.\nMost of the poems are short\u2014but\nvery direct, very hard hitting and\nintentionally so. There are illustrations\nby Spike and also his wile Laura that\nadd a lot to the atmosphere of the\nbook. Some of the verse is so well\nthought out that one finds it hard to\nbelieve \"some of the poems were\nwritten by dropping 800 English words\ninto a sack, taking them out one at a time and calling them by their names\nlike 'Hello Sailor',\" as Milligan would\nhave us believe.\nThe topics of the poems range from\nwar and preservation to the tender\nones dealing with the plight of children in trouble, like those of Aberfan,\n\"I don't burn coal any more.\"\nThis is not a book to be read on a longish train journey, but one to be\ntaken in small selective doses so that\nit will stimulate and provoke thought\non those topics and causes dear to Spike\nMilligan's heart.\nIn many ways it is an amazing and\nsurprising book and at times confusing.\nSome of the poems are presented twice,\non opposite pages, once in normal type\nface lettering and the other in( pre-sum ably) Spike's original handwriting.\nThe poems deal with their subjects in a human, compassionate way and in so\ndoing give an insight to the man, the\nfamily man Spike Milligan, that is\nrarely evident and certainly not obvious\nin li is many other books.\nThere are many short verses and\nlines that are powerful enough to hit\none immediately, like\n'Tf I die in war you remember me.\nIf I live in peace you don't.\"\" God made night, but man made\ndarkness.\"\nNow that this volume is available in\npaperback for the first time you have\nno excuse for not owning a copy. If\nyou're a Milligan-mahi ac you'll buy it\nanyway and be pleasantly surprised, if\nyou're not you still can't afford to be\nwithout it. Anything by Spike Milligan is more than a book, in this case it's a testimony to our present world and\nway of life. A favourable testimony?\nWell get the book and find out . . . a toil-of things.\nJEREMY BARKER Jack Kerouac was born in 1922 in Lowell, Mass., the son of a printer and\na French-Canadian girl. He attended\nColumbia University from 1940 to 1942,\nand then left to hitch and odd-job his\nway around, eventually becoming part\nof the \"underground\" of Greenwich\nVillage, New York. His first book, The\nTown and The City, was successfully\npublished in 1950, but he was little-known outside America until 1956 when\nhe produced \" On the Road\" which,\nwith \" Howl and other Poems\" by Ar thur Ginsberg became a sacred text of\nthe 'beatniks'.\nJack Kerouac has since written many\nbooks, all following the loose line of the\n'beat poets', but his prose carries more than the mere trendy message of some\nof his contemporaries. Like Orwell,\nKerouac only writes of what he knows,\nand it is this autobiographical viewpoint\nwhich gives his novels their relaxed\ncohesion. The 'hero' of a Kerouac story\nwill be a thinly-veiled Kerouac; a point\nto bear in mind when considering his\nwork. Even the Town and the City is\nnot a narrative with the outsider looking in; it is the insider, Peter, looking\nin and about, w'it to all the apprehensions\nand stumbling errors of a teenager.\nThe Town and the City is not, then,\nthe saga of each member of an A meri can family which you might expect\nfrom a glance at the blurb. Instead it is\nThe town and the city\nby Jack Kero vac the saga of Peter, the third son in a family of five sons and three daughters, who finds that excellence in sport\nis an artificial and limited criterion of\nsuccess, and sets out to look for truth.\nOf the Other characters, Francis and\nMr. 'George' Martin are admirably\nportrayed, and in Mickey and Charley,\nKerouac reveals his keen memory and\nunderstanding of the emotions of child-hood. The other members of the family-have an air of being 'extras': the sisters\nare seen through the eyes of a busy\nbrother as part of home, yet different\nbeings on another plane of existence,\nwhile Mrs. Martin leaves the impression\nof a worried card-sharper rather than\nthe contented understanding mother.,\nII seems likely that this re-issue is the\nresult of some publisher equating the\npresent 'off-beat' scene with that of\nthe '50s'. It pleases me to define literary\nclassics as writings which always have\nrelevance, in which case I can sincerely\ndeclare this book to be a classic . . .\nand the publisher to have been, in a sense, right.\nFor a paperback the book is well-bound, with a pretty dust-jacket so you\ncan cover it. If \u00a31.75 is a bit steep for\na novel, put it on your Christmas list or\ngive it to your fiancee. At any rate, if\nyou haven't met Kerouac before, be sure\nto read iit.\nCANES, Johnathan Livingston Seagull could\nbe described as the narrated story of\nan extremely individual gull who rejects the life of the seagull flock, \"fight-ing and screeching with the flock\naround piers and fishing boats, diving\non scraps of fish and bread,\" living to\neat, never flying through the night,\nthrough the storm, never leaving the\nrocky shore behind.\nJohnathan is a gull who \"finds and\nfollows a meaning, a higher purpose for\nlife,\" ever to learn to fly better. We then\nlearn of Johnathan's conflict with the\nflock, his increasing flying ability, until\nhe learns to fly \"as fast as a thought\"\nthrough time and space because he\nknows himself to be unlimited \" a perfect idea of freedom of flight.\"\n\" But to describe it in this way is not\nto define it, the book has 93 pages, 43\nof them pictures of gulls in flight, is a glossy and pleasing presentation of a really rather lovely and original story.\nI was rather surprised as you might be,\nJohnathan Livingston\nSeagull\nas to how much I enjoyed the tale of the\n''ascent of the gull\".\nBut to say this much would be to\nleave the intended point of the book\nun mentioned. J. Seagull goes on to\nteach, to introduce other gulls to his\njoy, thus the book becomes a direct\nparallel of Christ teaching love. This\nundisguised snowballing element of the\nbook certainly detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story; though Iam stil i amused to feel that despite its in-tent ions, those of a humanist outlook\nwould see the story as more truly a parallel of man's intellectual ascent, a search for purity in knowledge.\nThe photographs, though not all\nessential, do add something to one's enjoyment, especially in the first half\nof the book.\nAt50p it is an expensive hour's reading, t tough one that offers more\nsheer emotional pleasure than most, and\none which I could repeat.\n\n"

A great deal of her life has been\nspent doing voluntary social work. Be fore coming here, while living in Islington, she worked for the 'Family Service\nUnit' and also for the 'National Association for Mental Health'. This was\nwhile Sir Brian was chairman of the\nScience Research Council. She worked\nto prevent the splitting up of families\nin: one case and to bring a greater\nunderstanding of mental disorders in the other.\nNaturally Lady Flowers is well aware\nof the stresses and strains which we\npoor, overworked students are subject\nto and is very concerned. Being a very\nsensitive person, who has at time suffered depression and loneliness, she\nrealises the problems of people around\nher, and tries to help. Working with\nthe telephone Samaritans was another\nwork which she found very taxing\nemotionally. Perhaps it was as a reaction to the misery and depression\nwhich she had come across, that she at\none point became a model. Being older\nthan most models she seemed to have\nthe knack of matching clothes, natur-ally, and eventually drifted into training models. Her new customers with\ntheir many and varied wardrobes were\na long way away from the women who\nhad never had more than one outfit.\nTheir continued and expensive fight\nwith obesity had nothing in common\nwith the struggle of the others. But, she\nenjoyed modelling and thinks that the\nclothes consciousness which she acquired will never leave her, nor will her\ngood posture.\nLady Flowers makes her own clothes,\nfor her the achievement of making\nsomething outweighs the gratification\nwhich most women get out of buying\nan expensive dress.\nWith this background what does she\nfeel about the way girl students dress?\nShe likes the liberal ness of the clothes,\nthough she feels (they could be a little\nneater. But a compliment to all girls at\nthe I CW A Dinner, she thinks you were\nvery smartly dressed, she especially\nSir Brian plays the cello, and Lady\nFlowers the piano (in private). She has\nalways been a great concert\ngoer, and enjoys jazz and dancing. Her greatest pleasure is Ito listen to radio 3,\nwhile doing her cooking, always giving\nit her personal touch. In answer to my question about her literary aspirations,\nshe showed me a long row of cookery\nbooks in many languages and from\nmany more lands. She reads them in\nbed for inspiration.\nLady Flowers was born in a middle\nClass family in Manchester, and still remembers the servants in her grand-mother's house, who lived in the attic,\nhad an outside lavatory and always\npresented things on trays. Her father\nis the well-known liberal Sir Leonard\nBehrens. He ran for parliament twice.\nLADY FLOWERS\nliked the Laura Ashley clothes.\nLady Flowers' sense of colour carries\nover to her kitchen and her paintings.\nShe is good at putting colours together,\nin contrast to Sir Brian who is predictably more preoccupied with technical\nproblems in paintings like representing\nglass on canvas, cylindrical shapes and\ncreases on a well-worn pair of shoes!\nTo do him justice, he did have a rather\ngood portrait of his sister on the easel\nin his studio.\nunsuccessfully, but nonetheless never\nlost his deposit. Lady Flowers of course\ntook a view to the left of her father\nand became a Marxist. She thinks\nMarx and Engels make good reading\nbut the revolutionary zeal of her\nyounger days has watered down. She\nhas visited the USSR, Czechoslovakia,\nPoland, and has been disillusioned perhaps by the closed society of the Communist countries. She was very im pressed by the re-building and public\nservices in East Berlin and by the\nachievements of Tito in his non aligned\npolicy.\nRegarding British politics she is a mild Socialist and would like to see a lot of alterations, though without a revolution. Although she has seen the\ngreat misery and poverty of many\npeople, she feels sorry that they have to\nresort to strike action and does not support the extreme position of some\ntrades unions. She is a floating voter\nbut has only voted Conservative once,\nnever to repeat it.\nLady Flowers has not had time to\nsort out the tangle of political opinion\nat IC yet though like every Fresher she\nhas been bombarded with bump h.I told her about the exciting battles\nwaged in FELIX, CEF E, BROADSHEET etc., and she said she would\ncatch up over the weekend. Good luck\nto her!\nAt present Lady Flowers is occupied\nwith the various organisations she has\nto deal with, like the IC wives club of\nwhich she is chairman. She has to learn\na lot of names and is finding out who\neveryone is and how everything works.\nThis of course includes ICU and the\nCC U's. She is interested in meeting the\nstudents and has got in touch with\nNorm. Sayles and Anne Short to arrange cocktail parties and of course\nlike every other fresher she has realised\nthe difficulty of having a well balanced\ngathering with the chronic shortage of\ngirls.\nAre we studying anything Meaningful ?\nHow do we know if the subjects we\nstudy are obsolete or meaningless?\nLet's look at some of the problems of\napplying our I.C. acquired knowledge\nduring our working life.\na) Energy resources\nBritain is an import-export country\nwho cannot feed herself out of her own land (at least under present conditions)\nin spite of using more than one calorie\nof fuel to obtain each calorie of food.\nFor this reason it is important not only\nto know whether or not Britain will\nhave fuel in the next decades but also\nto know whether or not the countries\nimporting costly high-fuel-consuming\nBritish-made machinery and products,\nwill have fuel and money enough for\nthe imports to make any sense to them.\nThere are obviously very serious\nforeseeable difficulties with oil supplies,\nbe it in the next few years or in the\n'80's or'90' s. The same applies to coal,\nespecially in other countries. Nuclear\npower does not seem to promise anything significant, given the size and\nproximity of the energy problem.\nLess fuel abroad means less planes\ncoming to Britain, less tourists leaving\ntheir foreign currencies, less high-fuel-consuming British-made machinery, less\nhigh-fuel-consuming civil engineering\nBritish contracts abroad, etc.\nb) Pollution\nThere are two kinds of increasing\npollution problems brought about by\nindustrialisation and \"progress\". 1 \u2014\n, The higher levels of pollution due to in creasing numbers and concentration of\nmachines, apparatus, etc., from the\nriver polluting factory to our neigh-b our's noisy electric shaver that also\ninterferes our radio reception; 2 \u2014 The normal desire of people to relatively\nimprove their environment.\nTo sOlve these problems the obvious\nway out is to produce less, down to the\nnecessary level. This implies such\ntaboos as reducing the G.N.P. and the\ngrowth of large corporations and\nmonopolies, etc., so that only a few\nnon-industrialised nations are likely to\nadopt this policy in the near future.\nThe second policy, the one adopted by\nindustrial nations, is to produce anti-pollution devices and gadgets (the production of which causes more pollution)\nat the expense of general increases in costs. The first pa\u00a3cy means for\nBritain, less exports of high-energy-consuming machinery and techniques\nand less exports of products in general.\nThe second one means, ever higher\nprices of products that can only be\nafforded by an ever-reducing number of\npeople (until inflation allows it) as well\nas increasing demands for energy and\nresources in general. ( GO TO' a).c) Growth of population and GNP plus inflation mean shortages and\nhigher costs of basic resources such as\nland, food, housing, etc., which are the\nthings that Britain either lacks or has\nto import. At the same time these\nshortages divert the interests of the\nconsumers of British industrial products towards the more basic needs\nboth here and abroad. For example,\noverpopulation plus increased need for\nspace for factories, mines, roads, air-ports, etc., means world-wide prices in crease, and hence less spare money for\nTVs, cars, machinery and other typical\nBritish pro dud ts, both home and\nabroad. Also, the problems just mentioned worsen the above-mentioned\nones.\n( GOTO a. OR b.)AtI. C. we learn how to invent, design and build these highly sophisticated, costly, Mgh-energy-consuming\n, products that contribute to all these\ntroubles.\nAll these problems will come well\nwithin our working life: Petrol rationing was a reality in the U.S. even before the Middle East war; petrol ration-\"\ning due to political reasons is a reality\nnow, and so are the pd tro l price rises;\ntendencies towards self sufficiency and\nlow energy consumption are a reality\nnow in some countries; escalating land\nprices, over population and housing\nshortages are a world wide reality today and so are rising levels and costs\nof pollution.\nWhey then are we compelled to study\nhigh - energy - consuming technology\n(with planned ob sole sence) assessed\nonly by traditional economics (if at all)\nwithout taking all these problems into\naccount?\nOne of the reasons is that we have\nbeen streamed into highly fragmented\nfields, in order to achieve high levels of\nspecial is ation, thus not getting to know\nmuch even about neighbouring fields,\nlet alone i the social, ecological and\npoli it cal implications of our studies or\neven why should we reach high levels\nof special is ation or why should we pursue this type of science and technology.\nAnother reason is that we didn't have much choice anyway; we had to\n\"choose\" from among a GIVEN number of pre-packaged approved fields of\nstudy (if we wanted to get a degree\nand a \"good job\", that is).\nHave you heard of low energy tech-no logy? Alternative technology? Technology assessment? Non-industrial\ntechnology? Science for people? These\nare SOME ways by which people are\ntrying to face the real problems of today and tomorrow, rather than \"plan-ning for a future\" which is nothing\nbut an extrapolation of the past and hoping to solve the problems with an expansion of our obsolete remedies.\nBut are we allowed to study such\nthings at I.C., with recognition and getting a degree? . . .\nJ.

Bob Davenport and Rakes.\nIC BROAD\nLEFT STATEMENT\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that\nImperial College Union is facing a crisis of leadership. The attempt by some\nmembers of the Union to prevent the\norganisation of any actions on grants\nthis term and the ineffectiveness of the\nrefectory prices campaign are but two\nsymptoms of a wider malaise, the ap-pear ance, not so much of apathy but\nof irrationality in the Union; the tendency to oppose motions or actions\nsimply because the left has proposed\nthem; to sabotage rather than argue\nagainst; to in effect propose no action\non urgent issues, which face students.\nAnd prominent figures in the Union hierarchy have supported this trend.\nParadoxically, the majority at Union\nmeetings have continued to vote for the\npolicies proposed by the left and, as\non prices, have adopted the most militant form of action suggested \u2014 but\nwithout the commitment needed to\nmake it a success. The activists who\nhave tried to implement union policy\nhave been a small minority, our militancy may have publicised the issues to\nstudents, but it has not persuaded them\nto join in and turn minority militancy\ninto majority militancy. Clearly a major rethink of our approach is necessary. We believe that the fault does not lie\nin the policies of the left (and I.C. Union) but in a lack of strategy which has\nled to tactics which have failed to win\nthe massive student support which success requires. Our fundamental aim must be to win\nwide support for our policies, it is\nnecessary to foster a greater understanding of the issues faced by students\nand must be our primary task and\nto win the support, and part ic ipa tion, of the majority of students, in actions to achieve the Unions! aims. Practice has refuted the idea that the mass\nof students are like an explosive, to be\ndetonated by the actions of a militant\nhandful. But neither is it simply a question of \"Better communication.\" Students must themselves be involved in\nactions. If less militant mass actions are\nsuccessful in getting support but fail to\nwin our demands, the commitment, understanding and. perhaps, most imp or tant, confidence in the Union, will have\nbeen created for more militant action.\nTo give this sort of leadership, to the\nbest of our ability, we propose to form\na Broad Left grouping in I.C. Union,\nwith similar policies to the Broad Left\nin N.U.S. which has been responsible\nfor the left ward shift there, in recent\nyears, and in many other Student Uni ons, eg. Sussex, Cambridge, which\nmanage to combine left policies with\nthe active involvement of the majority\nof students.\n(1) The most importance issues of\nthe last few years have been the defence of student unions and the fight\nagainst inflation, whether for higher\ngrants and demonstrating rates or\nagainst price rises. Militant mass action\nhas been at least partially successful at\nboth local and national level. But we\ndo not propose to concern ourselves\nsolely with the economic issues. One issue of concern to all students which the\nleft has sadly neglected, is academic affairs \u2014 what we are taught, how we are\nassessed. In particular we must take a critical look at the increasing influence\nof the profit motive in determining\nwhat we are taught and the research we\ndo.\n(2) Students are badly in need of reliable allies. Many of the issues which\nface us, inflation, housing, defence of\nunions etc., are faced equally and often\nmore so by working people. The basis\nfor unity exists if we work for it. But not just through socialists students helping workers struggles but in a way\nwhich involves large numbers of ordinary students and workers eg through a joint campaign for grants which do not\nexclude) working class children from\nhigher education (as N.U.S. suggest).\nPORTABLE ELECTRONIC CALCULATORS Tremendous value\nfor money, adds, sub-tracts, divides, multi-plies; also can be\nused for logs, trig\npowers and roots.\nBrand new. 1 year's guarantee \u2014 Fits into top pocket. \u00a327\n(Plus V.A.T.). CE COURT ELECTRONICS Cambridge Trading\nEstate, Hanweli,\nLondonW7 3PA.015679672(3) We welcome the increasing willingness of student union and NUS to\nexpress collective views on wider issues\neg racial is m, the environment, South\nAfrica. This is particularly relevant in a college with such a large percentage of\noverseas students. We believe that I.C. Union should support not just our fellow students in other countries but their\nfellow countrymen against colonial or\nneo-colonial regimes.\nIn all these policies, our aim is to get\nmaximum support while keeping to our\nprincipal beliefs.\nUnfortunately, when tactics have\nbeen proposed which could have started to involve the majority of students\nthey have been directly opposed by organised groups in I.C. as was the case\nwhen the proposal to launch a massive\npetition campaign on prices to be delivered by a mass demonstration to the\nGoverning Body, was defeated at the\nlast U GM. Similarly, the policies of\nNUS are rarely argued for, in this Uni on, because of hostility from both the\nright and sections of the left.\nIn launching a Broad Left grouping\nwhich involves students from inside and\noutside the Socialist Society in IC we\nare in no way counter posing it to Socialist Society. Its value as a Forum remains and, on policy, much unity ex-is ts, although on strategy and tactics\nwe differ. Nor do we claim to be overcoming the sectarianism of the left\u2014\nno doubt some people will be quite\n(continued on page 8)\n\n"

The police were even called in the hopes\nthat they would be able to force students to\npay college's inflated prices instead of last\nyear's price.\nThe authorities backed\ndown at the last minute\nand sent the police away;\ninstead college tried to\nuse i their own 'police'.\nChief of police (security)\nMr. Dawson warned that\na student could be prosecuted under the theft\nact for refusing to accept\nthe inflated college price.\nMr. Dawson pointed out\n(apologised?) that he did not make the laws and that he only interpreted\nthem. He made no comment when it was pointed\nout that the law in this\ncase was being used to ensure that students (like\nworkers with the pay\nJaws) were being made to\naccept the burden of inflation through these refectory increases. The authorities seemed so concerned to ensure that\nstudents were made to\npay, that they 'sent along'\nsome of their higher\nofficials namely Mr. Mooney and Mr. Seaford\nto the refectories to in crease the line of 'heavies'\nby the till..\nUnion exec seemed to\nhave a strange way of\nsupporting union policy.\nUnion exec threatened\na student with disciplinary action for implementing union policy. It is\nhardly reassuring to know\nthat our exec are willing\nto attack those who implement union policy. Mr. Seaford likewise issued\nthreats presumably with a view to persuading students from further ac-tion?\nCollege seem to accept\nthat any increase in our grant should be immediately eroded- away by in-, creases in college prices.\nThis comes from a body\nwho claim to support the\ngrants campaign! They\nmust feel an increase in grant justifies higher\ncollege prices so students\nare no better off; instead\ncollege can save on expenditure by these in creases and delude students that they have real\nincrease in income.\nNext year I.C. students\ncan look forward to an even bigger increase in refectory prices, also a rent increase for halls and\nstudent houses! Judging\nby this year's exec lack\nof interest in the grants\ncampaign (no body from\nexec could even be\nbothered to g6 to last\nweekend's national con-ference) and attempts not\nto support union policy\non fighting refectory in. creases; (Perhaps exec\nhave forgotten the situation most students are\nfacing and are too busy\ngetting fat on their free\nmeals and sherry with\ncollege?) we are unlikely\nto expect a lead from\nthem in a fight against\nthese increases. The only\npeople we can rely on are\nourselves.\nNLP- End of\nOccupation\nLast week at a Union General Meeting at North London Polytechnic a motion was tabled by the International Socialists in conjunction with the Conservative Society to end the week long occupation of the Administration block. The students who had occupied as a protest to force the resignation of their Director Terence Miller voted to end the occupation by an overwhelming majority. Television cameras, microphones and reporters from the \" nationals\" were there at the U GM which was attended by something in the order of500 students( Telegraph) to 1 , 0 0 0 ( Guardian). The day before the occupation ended last Wednesday40 members of the National and Local Government Officers Association( NAL GO) walked out because of the mess and disruption caused by the s it in. The students were sensitive to this and it was a contributing factor to the tabling of\nthe motion. The meeting requested the executive publish certain documents unearthed In the Administration files during the occupation which disclosed certain irregularities in the' appointment of Mr. Christopher Champ ness as head of the Law Department. The occupation has been liquidated by the I.S. because the students at NLP realise they fia cea whole range of problems in common with students everywhere \u2014 problems whose solution involves a political fight against the Tory government and not 'another round of mindless militancy which is the by word of these revisionist groups. However to back down before this political fight is a betrayal of the students and as we see above plays right into the hands of Miller and the rightwing.| PURPLE PATCH j During the past week, the the Postgraduate grant will to end with.

Students are not calling on\n\u2022he Government to slow down the rate of expansion\nof higher education: that would be an intolerable be-tray al. Nor are they asking the Government to find\nStudents somewhere to live in preference to finding\nnon-students somewhere to live; the Government's responsibility, Which it has consistently refused to\nface, is to all people, students included, Who are prohibited under its income controls from earning enough\nto pay the prices charged under its Housing Finance\nAct.\n\u2022Cambridge Technical College students are occupying Owlstone Hall of Residence, which would provide 150 good, modern study-bedrooms for Cam bridge Tech's students, and solve its accommodation problem\u2014but which has been empty for\nthree years. It used to be a nurses home, but in1970 the Department of Health and Social Security offered\nit to Cambridge Technical College, and then a few\nweeks later withdrew the offer, saying they wished\nto pull it down, and build a hospital management\ntraining centre. It has lain empty ever since, until\nhomeless students from Cambridge Technical College\noccupied it last week. The D.H.S. S. are now ready to\nreverse their original decision and leave the building\nstanding.\n*Sussex University students have just ended an occupation of their administrative block. Many Sussex\nstudents live a long way away, since accommodation\nin Brighton and Lewes has become expensive and\nhard to find. They were demanding that the University should make up the difference between what is\nallowed in the grant for board and lodging and what\nthe students were actually having to pay. The -Univer-s it y has now agreed.\nTeesside College of Education students have just\nfinished occupying half their College\u2014the half which\nwas due to be pulled down last Monday. The College, and the students, were told that they had just\none week to pull out and allow a development company to build on the site. Instead of pulling out, they\noccupied; and the caretakers refused to do overtime\nto move the College possessions out of the threatened\nhalf of the building. They have now moved out, and\nalthough the building is still to be pulled down, they\nhave forced the local authority to provide temporary\naccommodation for the displaced parts of the col-leg e. Sympathetic vice-chancellors\nOn Monday, 12th October the Committee of Vice\nChancellor's stated their concern that unless something was done about student grants only the wealthy\nwould be able to go to university.\nThe Vice-Chancellors are concerned that the principle set down by the Anderson Committee in1960 is being eroded. This committee reported that grants\nshould be available to cover the reasonable basic\nmaintenance costs of first degree students. The ViceChancellors said that the \"Governments have begun\nto threaten this principle by fixing grants which fall\nshort of basic living costs\".\nThey expressed particular concern at the current\ncost of housing for students. They say that universities\nmust be able to fix rents in halls of residence at a level which students can afford. The Vice Chancellors are obviously worried that many students in halls of residence have to pay more for board and\nlodging than is allocated in the grant. Students\nreacted to these high charges last year by refusing\nto pay their rent.\nThe Committee of Vice Chancellors will make their\nviews known to the DES while the review of grants\nfor the next three years is underway. They want student grants to be fixed initially at realistic levels and\nwant grants to be supplemented annually to take\naccount of changing prices.\nThe Vice Chancellors may feel sympathetic to the\nstudents' predicament but it does not seem that they\nare going to regard rent strikes with any sympathy.\nThe university heads regard rent strike action as mis-conceived. They say that it \"wastes time and money\non conflicts which are not created by universities and\n\u2022 which are not in their power to resolve.\"\nSeveral recent incidents show that they may be\npreparing to take a hard line over the rent strike\nissue. Harry Kay, the Vice Chancellor at Exeter\nUniversity was asked by Peter Smart, President of J the Students' Union to address a meeting of first year\n; students. It had been agreed before the meeting that\nit would be simply a welcoming speech. However,\nMr. Kay, after expressing his delight at seeing rows\nof new faces, then proceeded to tell them that rent\nstrikes were not a good thing and hoped that they\nwould not themselves think of participating in one.\nAlec Merrison, Vice Chancellor of Bristol University, has been using the university news letter to warn\nstudents against rent strikes.\nStudents take over\nMusic School\nA number of Manchester students are squatting in the old College of Music situated near the University\nUnion building. The property previously housed the\nRoyal Northern College of Music which has since\nmoved to a \u00a31 million complex near the University\nPrecinct Centre.\nThe squatters hope to develop the buildings as an overspill for activities of the University Union. At the moment it is providing much needed temporary\naccommodation for students who have- been unable\nto find anywhere to live.\nThe Principal of the Music College, Air Commodore Vaughan, said in reaction to the squat that the\nbuilding is to stand for two years at least and is still\nused for occasional music practice. The city planners\nhave said that they want to pull the building down\nby Christmas to make way for a car park.\nWhen the squat first began the university threatened to evict the students, but this no longer seer ns likely. A group of the squatters and student union\nofficers from the university met representatives from\nthe Music College and the university authorities and\nagreed that they would fry to use the building as\nlittle as possible during the day while music students\nwere using the practice rooms. A committee is being\nset up to examine how best to utilise the building.\nThe Welfare Vice President at Manchester University\nUnion said today that the most important thing was\nthat the building was properly used and not just\nallowed to rot.\nSir Brian Flowers\ndeplores low grants\n. . . and student action to\ndefend living standards\nThe former Chairman of the Science Research\nCouncil, SIR BRIAN FLOWERS, FRS, in his first\npublic address since becoming Rector of Imperial\nCollege, today deplored the low level of student maintenance grants. Speaking to an audience of Imperial\nCollege's staff, students and their parents in the Royal Albert Hall, Sir Brian said that students' opportunities to benefit from university life were being limited\nby the present depressed value of the grants they\nreceived. Even if one accepted the basis on which:\ngrants were calculated in1971( and he had reason!\nto believe that this was not entirely satisfactory) a! triennial scale fixed as it had turned out, for the j three years in which inflationary pressures had been;\nexceptionally severe, and lacking any suitable mech;anism for adjustments meanwhile, was not one which;\ncommended itself to anyone but the most arid of bureaucrats. Students believed that their grants were\nnow too low; but worse than that, they believed that\ntheir genuine financial difficulties were unrecognized\nbut socially divisive, that the level of grant undervalued the contributions they already made to society,\nStill more the contributions they were preparing themselves to make in the future. Sir Brian said that he\nshared these beliefs and that, so long as they were\nbeing responsibly expressed, he would support them.\nConsidering the position of an Imperial College\nundergraduate resident in a hall of residence or student house, Sir Brian said that he had calculated\nthat the present level of undergraduate maintenance\ngrant was deficient by at least \u00a3100 a year. He made\nno comment, he said, about students in other circumstances nor about the average student, whoever he\nmay be.\nSir Brian said that he recognized that any proposed\nincrease in student grants had to be sought in com-1\npetition with all other urgent calls on public funds1 \u2014for old-age pensions, new hospitals and schools. He also acknowledged that it was not for the universities\nto determine the social status of students, but he\nsubmitted that the proper financial welfare of our young people in universities and colleges was a matter\nmost deserving of the Government's urgent attention.\nLeeds Poly Sit-in\nStudents at Leeds Polytechnic reconvened a Union meeting in the administrative block at (the Polytechnic\nyesterday. About600 students decided to move into\nthe administrative block at 1 p.m. and several dozen\nstayed over night. They intend to remain in occupation of the block until Friday. They are protesting\nat the inadequacy of teaching, catering and union\nfacilities.\nThe telephone to the Polytechnic has been cut off\nby the P.O. at the request of the administration.\nThe Director of the Polytechnic, Patrick Nutgens,\nis in Scotland at the moment, but the Assistant Director, Gordon Wright, has expressed some sympathy\nwith the students. He has agreed that only \"essential\"\nwork will be carried out by the administration for\nthe next few days.\nIt is widely accepted amongst the a doi in is t ration, staff and students that facilities which were adequate\nfor 1,000 students are no longer adequate since there\nhas been a considerable expansion in student numbers*\nLeeds Education Committee are prepared to offer\nsome alternative accommodation in Headrow in Leeds. Alderman Arthur Tallant is expected to speak\nto the students in occupation today,\nMargaret Thatcher, Minister of Education, went to Leeds on Friday to open a factory in the morning and\na school in the afternoon. When she arrived to open\nthe school she was greeted by a large number of,\nstudents from all over Yorkshire.\nThe students marched from Leeds Polytechnic,\nThey protested about the plans for the future of education as expressed in last year's White Paper, \" A framework for expansion\" and the inadequacies of the grant system.\nStudents without grants\nSome Local Education Authorities have not yet\nsent out grant cheques to students who live in their area. Several colleges have reported that a num ber of their students are Still waiting for their grant\ncheques to come through.\nHuddersfield Polytechnic, Hereford College of Edu cation and the University of Warwick seem to bs\nparticularly badly hit. Tony Bowers, President of Huddersfield Polytechnic Students Union is hoping\nthat students in this predicament will be able to claim\nsocial security until their grant arrives. Warwick University has had to tell some students that their grants\nmay not arrive for another six weeks.\nOne of the reasons for the delay in the receipt of grants this year is that the LEA's have found it difficult to sort out the new grant regulations which\nMargaret Thatcher announced to Parliament on May15 th. The raising of the threshold level for parental\ncontributions from \u00a31,100 to \u00a31,500 has caused particular difficulty.\nResignation of Camhridge\nExecutive\nThe Cambridge Students' Union Executive has\nbeen forced to resign. The executive, the majority of\nwhom are on the right, was elected last term. Ever\nsince they have said that i they have been hamstrung\nby the composition of general meetings, which by the\nconstitution of the union make all major policy\ndecisions. They claim that general meetings are not\nrepresentative of the majority of students in Cam bridge.\nLast Tuesday this executive called a referendum\nto attempt to change the constitution so that policy\nwas made by referenda and not by general meeting.\nStudents were asked if they wanted i the Union to be\ncontrolled by referenda or general meeting.\nWhen the result of i the referendum was known the\nright found that they had been defeated by their own tactics. 2,156 students voted in favour of taking decision making power away from general meeting, but\n3,046 students voted that the general meeting should\nretain sovereign power. This is the highest poll that\nhas ever taken place among Cambridge students.\nNeville Walton, who was elected as the Camhridge\nStudent Union president now finds himself in a difficult position. As a sabbatical officer on his resignation he will no longer be either a member of the\nuniversity, because he is not registered at Cam* bridge as a student this year, or a member of the\nstudents' union. He is reported to have since fled to\nGermany.\n\n"

Why did Heath\nsay in his address to the\nUnited Nations in 1 9 7 0 : \" The seventies will not be a time\nof war between nations, but\nrather of CIVIL war\"? Why d id Brigadier Calvert state\nwith such impunity, in an\nObserver colour supplement\na few months ago, that it is\nlikely that there will be an\nattempted insurrection before\nthe end of the decade? How\ndo the Tories KNOW? The answer to that is demonstrated every time you\ngo to the shops\u2014inflation. In\norder to boost up their flagging balance of payments, in\norder to inject value into\ntheir worthless paper money,\nthey have floated down the\npound. This enables them to\nexport easily to countries\nlike Germany whose currency has floated up \u2014 but at the same time imports\ncost that much more. Half\nof our foodstuffs are imported and every time the Tories\nfloat down further and make\nhuge profits from exporting\nmore (on paper only incident ally \u2014 you can't buy dear and\nsell cheap and make a CONCRETE profit!) our food\nprices shoot to new record\nlev a's. The Tories have to do this, they have no choice, for\nthem to exist as a class they\nhave to export or die. But for\nthe working class it means\na rapidly diminishing standard of living and with every\nlaw that passes onto the statute books of the Tories, the\nsigning away of the democratic rights of the working\nclass \u2014 until today when it is\nillegal to fight to DEFEND your standard of living.\nInflation? We haven't seen anything yet. When the\nFinancial Times talks about\nthis being a period of PreW ei mar inflation it means\nthat prices will not just go\nthrough the ceiling \u2014 but through the roof and into\ninterstellar overdrive? Remember the one mark German stamps overstamped one\nmillion marks? \u2014 That was inflation during the pero d of\nthe Weimar Republic of the\nearly 30s. That the working class\nwill fight to defend its rights\nand living standards neither\nthe Tories nor the Y SSS have any doubt. Whether it\nwins that struggle or not depends on the leadership of\nthe working class. When we\nare talking about this conflict we are talking about the\nquestion of power, of ownership of the factories and finance houses, and the sole\nway that the working class\ncan avoid the crushing defeat of fascism is to take the\npower \u2014 to national is e all the\nmajor industries and banks\nunder workers' control and\nwithout compensation.\nPlaced against the background of the economic crisis and the present preparations of the ruling class \u2014\ndoes not campaigning with\npetitions for higher grants\nseem somewhat inadequate?\nExcept of course unless one\nneeds to learn through practice that petitions lead only to full waste paper baskets\nin the DES and rent strikes\nto fines or being sent down,\nperiod.\nBut is that not the lesson\nof last year's grants campaign and the lesson of all\nprotest politics be they in\nthe Trade or Student Unions,\nin this period \u2014 that reformism leads to defeat, and that\na new, revolutionary, leadership has to be built to fight\nto take the working class to\npower.\nThen it follows that for\nthose in the broad left and\ntheir adherents, to now\nlaunch a campaign to win\nstudents to policies and\nmethods of struggle which\nhave been proved IN PRACTICE to be incapable of winning any th ng except a further cut in our grants,\nconstitutes a most enormous\nbetrayal of the interests of\nstudents and the working\nclass. This is not to say that it\nis a betrayal to fight for\nhigh ter grants, s imp iy that unless that struggle is seen in the context of a fight to\nbring down this Government and replace it with a labour government pledged to socialist policies, any increase that we win we will be unable to defend, and like the \u00a3 2 0 we received for this\nyear, will be destroyed by\ninflation. Furthermore that\nthat this gives more time for the forces of reaction to pre pare and organise. To finish with the words\nof Horace: Carpe diem, for\nthe longer we dally \u2014 the more our British junta is preparing to crush our British\nAllendes.\nEditor\nMedical Aid for Vietnam\nby Alastair Hay The war in Indo China, although it currently receives little news coverage, is far from over. It is\nreported that there are over 100 bombing missions a day by the Saigon forces and that the number of\npolitical prisoners has increased from 200,000 to\n300,000 in the past few months. These are only two\nof the violations of the Paris Peace Agreements. The\nimportance of the Agreements is recognised in the\nfollowing statement from Madame Nguyen Thi Binh,\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam ( PR G) in a letter to the Medical Aid Committee\nfor Vietnam, wrote:\n\" We ardently wish that the solidarity and the\nprecious support of your people will continue, and\nstrengthen us in our struggle to ensure the strict\nimplementation by the USA and the Saigon administration of the Agreement signed, to acknowledge the\nrole of the PR G, the genuine representative of the\npeople of South Vietnam, to help heal the wounds\nof war to build up the liberated zones and to support\nthe political struggle of the people of South Vietnam\nfor the right to self-determination.\"\nBranson P. Clark, Executive Secretary of the\nAmerican Friends Service Committee (a Quaker or-gan is ation) having just returned from a week in North Vietnam, bad this to say: \" The Vietnamese are prepared for the possibility of renewed U.S. bombing on\ntheir country. But at the same time they are literally\nbuilding homes, schools and public buildings with\ntheir bare hands in an atmosphere of optimistic re-construction.\"\nThe whole story of destruction of Vietnam is not\nyet known, but we have some details. Nearly six\nmillion square metres of housing completely destroy-ed; 58 secondary and technical schools completely\ndestroyed; 2,867 primary schools completely\ndestroyed; agriculture was sy stern tait io ally destroyed.\nBombing of the dams destroyed many of the rice\nfields; three-quarters of all chemical plants were\ndestroyed; 80 per cent of the textile and clothing\nfactories destroyed, three-quarters of the food industry destroyed. Millions of square metres of ware-houses, holding food and produce were reduced to\nrubble.\nWith the destruction of over 650 hospitals, reconstruction of hospitals is special priority.\nThe Medical Aid Committee for Vietnam\n(M.A.C. U.) sends medical supplies to the Liberation Red Cross of South Vietnam and to the Vietnam Red Cross for use in North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Dr. Nguyen Van Tin, Vice-Minister of Health\nof the D.R. V. N. and President of the Vietnam Red Cross in a letter to M.A.C. U. acknowledges their\nimportance: \" Your aid and your expressions of support during the war, as in the initial phase of the\nrestoration of peace in Vietnam, touch us deeply and\ngive us great encouragement in our struggle to safeguard our independence. In spite of the blockade\nand the intensive bombardment by the U.S. Air Force, your consignments of medical instruments\nhave arrived at their destination . . . \"\nAll the evidence available indicates that the level\nof destruction in Cambodia is equally as that documented for Vietnam. It will be many years be tore the\nPeople of Indo China are able to rebuild Ithdr co un tries, and maintain a lasting peace. M.AC\"' have\nbeen assisting the Vietnamese for eight years and\nhope to play a positive role in the reconstruction\nof North Vietnam and i the liberated areas of South\nVietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Together with other\nEuropean committees M.A.C. U. supplies urgent drugs\nfor the treatment and prevention of malaria, tuber-los is, cholera, polio, measles, plague, and vitamin\ndeficiency diseases. Surgical equipment, 500 dental\npacks and 200 mobile hospital units are the latest\nitems which have been requested. The surgical equipment and dental packs have already been sent, and\n125 hospital units will be sent shortly. Each hospital\nunit costing \u00a31,000 each and containing over 1,000\ninstruments will enable a team of six medical personnel to treat people at village and commune level.\nTogether with i the medical supplies M.A.C. U. is\nrestocking hospital and medical libraries with the relevant journals and textbooks. 20 tons of literature,\nworth approx. \u00a330,000 has been sent this year. Medical slides for the teaching of the basic medical sciences\nare also in preparation-^four types in Anatomy,\nmorbid anatomy, Physiology and Midwifery have already been sent.\nThe Medical Aid Committee relies for its work on\nfinancial contributions, for individuals and groups,\nstreet collections and ' Rag' sponsoring. With 'Viet-nam' rapidly becoming an issue of the past it is\ncrucial to inform people that the danger is not over.\nM.A.C.
