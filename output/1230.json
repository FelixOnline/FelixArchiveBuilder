    "content": "interview film 23\nRichard Gere\nQ&A You haven't made a supernatural thriller before, is that why you wanted to do this?\nNo, it was the script itself. I didn't say, 'I want to make a scary\nmovie'. The script came and I could see the possibilities,\nalthough it went through a lot of drafts to find the balance\nbetween a scary movie and a smart movie.\nWhat did you like about the script?\nThe emotional stuff was rich. In the beginning, my character's in the perfect job, he has a beautiful wife, they're talking about\nbabies, they're buying a house, everything's great and then literally in the middle of laughing, there's a car accident and she's gone. Now if you put that on top of the metaphysical story of 'Is\nthere anything out there?', then you have something that has a lot of power.\nYou wanted to avoid the clich es of the genres, is that why we\ndon't see the moth man? That's the B movie version of this. The assumption is that this\nis a metaphysical story, not a ghost story, meaning that we're\nmaking the adult's thinking version. So the trick and brilliance\nof director Mark Pellington was finding a visual vocabulary that\nwould suggest a presence and give you the kind of chilling feeling that was much deeper and larger than 'Don't open that\ndoor!'. This was more like a dream and dreams aren't usually\n'there's something behind the door', they're more a feeling that\nseems to take over everything.\nYou normally play characters who are in control but your\ncharacter in this, John Klein, thinks he's going mad....\nI don't think the people I play are in control. I think the characters always strive for control and it's the fact that they can't have it that makes drama. They have the illusion of control but\nthe universe never gives any of us control, otherwise there'd be\nno drama at all. You know, people think they're on balance, life\nputs them off-balance and they have to find someway to reestablish balance.\nDo you think your efforts on behalf of the Tibetans and your\ncriticism of China have ever had a negative effect on your\ncareer?\nNo, no effect at all. I never really think about it. You know, you\nsay something that wasn't popular but I'm not aware of it when\nI'm doing it and then, quite often, I get these letters from my co-workers, other actors or musicians, thanking me for saying\nwhat ever I said.\nWhen you were a teenager, did you think that at 52 you'd be\na major star?\nOh, I never saw past 25. How can you project that far ahead? I had no idea. I mean, it's like asking a rock star if they think\nthey'll still be prancing around at 55. It's like no, you think\nyou're going to be dead at 26.\nSince the success of The Sixth Sense there seem to be more\nand more movies with supernatural themes. Why are we so\nfascinated by it?\nI don't think it ever goes away. It's part of our collective unconscious, whether we're tribal people or we're urban people. I think it's genetically-coded in us and, in a way, that belief is\nmore powerful in urban people who are continually having it cut\nout of their lives. So that need to express it is always there.\nWhat's your favourite scary movie?\nWell the scariest movie I ever saw had no ghost in it and that\nwas \"The Servant\". It was a Joseph Losey film from a Harold\nPinter screenplay and it was the same kind of terror that\n\"Mothman\" deals with: it calls into question the nature of identity. I think that's scary to everyone.\nDo you believe in psychic phenomena, and have you had any\npersonal experience of ghosts?\nI have no interest at all in that, although if someone came up\nwith the Loch Ness Monster I'd be interested. As for ghosts,\nthere's been nothing that shook me to my marrow.\nYour co-star is Laura Linney, who you worked with on 1996's Primal Fear when she was still unknown. Was it fun working\nwith her again?\nI was delighted because she helps elevate the film to the right\nlevel. We're very good friends and now, after You Can Count On\nMe, everyone realises how good she is.\nYou don't seem to dominate co-stars like some big movie\nstars..?\nNo, I like the collaborative process. I like people working\ntogether and what the project says and does is equally important to me as what I do. Do I have ideas about it? Of course I do\nand I 've been around long enough now for people to listen to\nme, for better or worse. But the satisfying thing about doing this\nmovie was working with all these extremely talented, hyper-creative people who were also very trusting and open, which\nwas important because this had to come together quickly; we\ndidn't have six weeks of rehearsal time.\nYou started out doing stage musicals like Grease and now\nyou're making the film of Chicago. Is that fun?\nIt's a total delight and it's something I haven't done since I was\na kid. Even then, I was working in musicals, but they were\nnever this kind of Broadway show. I get to sing and dance with\nbeautiful girls and I have a big tap-dancing number at the end.\nYou're a New Yorker, so how did you react to the events of\nSeptember 11th? It was so shocking that it kind of calls into question the nature\nof identity on many levels. The skyline of New York changed in\none hour. Just mind-boggling. To imagine that it's gone; something that we thought was going to be there as a monument for-ever. And the identity we had as a country totally changed and\nso did the people. As the anger and vengeance came up, that\nshocked our identity as well. You know, we're Christians, we're\nBuddhists, we're not supposed to feel this way.\n\n"

    "content": "college news\nWine Stolen From Union\nThirty-two bottles of wine,\nworth over \u00a3200, were stolen\nfrom the Union Dining Hall last\nweek in the latest of a series of\nthefts and attempted thefts in\nthe Union building.\nThe consignment was placed there at lunchtime in advance of a wine tasting session by ABV the RCSU club\nformed by the merger of the\nformer wine-tasting, cocktail\nand real ale societies - but\nwas taken at some point during the afternoon. ABV members are able to use the sessions to learn how to 'taste,\nsniff and slurp' wines under\nthe guidance of an expert.\nThe Union has conceded\njoint responsibility for the\nwine having being left in the\nunsecured room but has agreed to fully reimburse ABV for the loss. Security are currently checking CCTV footage\nin the hope of identifying\nthose responsible.\nThe theft comes in the wake\nof a series of similar incidents\non the first floor of the Union\nbuilding. A student had their\nbag stolen recently from\nreception, and the handbag of\nMandy Hurford, Union\nManager, was taken from her\noffice in a 'walk-in' theft.\nIn addition, the office of\nDave Parry, Union Finance\nManager, was involved in a similar incident a month ago.\nIt is thought that thieves\nentered and searched for valuables, but nothing was taken.\nIn view of the location of the\noffice, it is thought that the\nperpetrators were likely to be\neither students or staff, and\nmay have been scared off\nbefore they were able to take\nanything.\nKen Weir, head of College\nSecurity, told Felix that students and staff alike should\nremain vigilant with respect to\nsecuring their personal prop-er ty. He added that bags and\ncoats should never be left\nunattended over the back of\nchairs, for instance when in the libraries. Room doors\nshould always be locked when\nrooms are to be left un attend ed, even if it is only for two\nminutes. Valuables should\nnever be left where they can\nbe seen from outside, especially in rooms in the basement or on the ground floor.\nSimilarly, windows should not\nbe left open when rooms are\nunattended.\nABV hopes to hold its introductory wine tasting session,\nwhich had to be postponed\nfollowing the theft, in the near\nfuture.\nJohn S4 Issue 1230\n1 March 2002\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews: Alex Coby\nReporter: John Stratford\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nSports: Vacant\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nComic: J With Thanks To:\nBobby\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nRAG Week Success\nMore than \u00a39000 was raised\nfor the Shooting Star\nChildrens' Hospice Appeal during this year's RAG week.\nThe eight-day extravaganza\nculminated in last Friday's 'School Uniform Day', in which\nstudents took the opportunity\nto turn up in the apparel of\ntheir alma mater in return for a small charitable donation.\nMoney was also collected on\nthe day by a pair of RAG kiss a grams, and several hundred balloons were released\nfrom the Queen's Lawn in the\nRAG Balloon Race.

    "content": "reviews clubbing\n21st Century Body Rockers\n@ Cynthia's Robot Bar\nThis was the first 21st Century Body\nRockers night, organised by Cool Delta,\nand as such my expectations were high.\nCool Delta, in their own words, specialise \"in only cool, credible releases\",\nthese cool, credible people being the\nlikes of Aphex Twin, The Strokes, FC\nKahuna, Seafood, Ed Harcourt,\nCornelius, Squarepusher, Sigur Ros, Mull\nHistorical Society, Adam Freeland,\nPreston School Of Industry and Felix Da\nHousecat to name but a few. All in all,\nyou'd be forgiven for expecting an eclectic mix of left field, ambient, moody, alt-rock, no-wave, post-rock, lo-fi underground beats, breaks, harmonies and\nsoundscapes...\nThe venue itself suggests something\nslightly to the left of the avant-garde.\nCynthia's Robot Bar is nestled away\nunder the arches at London Bridge, and\nas such it comprises a maze of routes\nthrough retro-futuristic decorated rooms.\nEverything is shiny metal and flashing\nred lights. Seats light up when you sit on\nthem. A robot serves you drinks (well,\nactually it was a large, clunky contraption that was malfunctioning and just\nreplied \"PANIC\" to the request for a vodka and cranberry). And, of course, all\nthe people look \"cool and credible\".\nSo much for my expectations. The DJs\nfrom City Rockers proceeded to play\nwhat can only be described as \"tech-house\" all night. In all the rooms.\nWithout any variation or innovation. It\nnever even made it to techno proper, or\nto hard house, or to a decent four-to-the-floor. Any hint of the avant-garde had\nbeen ruthlessly removed, leaving me\nwondering if I'd come to the right club.\nEvery Saturday. Doors open at 11pm. There\n@ Heaven\nYou've all heard of it, you all know where\nit is, but how many of you have actually\nbeen? Heaven has been described as\n\"probably London's best-kept clubbing\nsecret\". Well, it's not exactly a secret that\nthere are three huge floors, each with different music policies. It's no secret that\nthe crowd in attendance aren't exactly\nshy - \"no holds barred\" begins to have\nmore interesting connotations. It's hardly\na high-level, confidential and politically\nsensitive datum that the dancefloor s and\nbars are packed with beautiful boys and\ngirls of all orientations proceeding to first\nglow, then perspire and finally sweat. So,\nwhither the mystique and aura? Go down\nand find out.\nLet us begin our tour of this delectable,\ndecadent and degraded diversion in the\nmain room, where the heaving crowd are\nkept smiling and raving to hard house\nand high energy trance. There's plenty of\naction from the DJs to keep our sweaty\nmob happy for a while. Let us leave this\ncrazy, loveable bunch and head towards\nthe Star Bar. Tonight is a special night, for\nno less a star than Kenny Carpenter (of\nNew York's Studio 54 fame) is DJing. We\nmay not have asked for house, but that's what we've got - the finest in US house to\nwrithe rhythmically to. Or maybe you can\nkeep in time to the shakes of the other\nguests, such as Joey Negro.\nPerhaps you fancy something different.\nWhy not mosey on into the Dakota Bar, for\nsome urban beats and alternative flav as? You are now in the office party to end all\noffice parties, the speakers are pumping\nout Kylie and the Chemicals, and some-one's nicked the fax machine. You no\nlonger care.\nEvery Friday. Doors open at 10pm. Going Clubbing\nOn The Cheap\nWord up peeps.\nIf you read this on Friday and you're\nnot going out tonight, then shame on\nyou. However, if you'd like to join the\nelite ranks of Felix clubbing reviewers,\nand b lag your way into some quality\n(and, alas, kw ali ty) clubs, then simply\nread on...\nI am looking for people who are interested in clubbing (or just scoring a free\nnight out for themselves) to write to me\nat clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk, leaving contact\ndetails.

    "content": "Condominium? Dear Felix,\nI would like to write to both\nJolyon Thompson and Irene\nWeinreib with regard to their\nreply to an Inkwell article\nprinted the issue before, an\narticle I whole heart ly agreed\nwith.\nSurely the single most\nimportant aim should be to\npromote being responsible\nand safe to those who are\ngoing to have sex, and to make\nthis as easy as possible. And the worst argument has to be\nthat displaying condoms\nwould be offensive to those\nwhose religious group opposes contraception. I'm sorry, but\nif I was a member of one of\nthese religious groups then I would find this argument itself\noffensive. We undoubtedly live\nin a multicultural society:\nSurely it is time that we are all\nable to accept each other the\nway we are, and live peacefully together? She argues that\nit's disappointing that we live\nin a society that is too\nrepressed to talk about sex,\nyet seems happy that we live\nin a society too repressed to\nopenly accept each others\nbeliefs. I'm not arguing that\nwe should be brazen or insensitive, but I would ask how\nmany people would admit to\nbe offended by a few packets\nof condoms placed discreetly\nin the corner of the health c en tre?\nIn reply to Irene, if the health\ncentre has to provide statistics\nconcerning their supply of con-dom s, how are they able to\ngive 2500 to the ICSU to distribute during fresher s week?\nDo the fresher s have to fill out\na form? Since they are able to\ndo this, can they not for example provide 20% without this\nfrankly ridiculous bureau cr a cy? These could be placed in\nthe health centre at start of\neach morning's surgery and\nmade available to those who\ndo not feel confident in having\nto fill out a form and having\ntheir \"statistics\" placed on\ntheir patient record.\nSadly, it seems that because\nthe health centre has\nfavourable statistics regarding\nunwanted pregnancies, it\ntherefore feels that there is no\nmotivation for trying to make\nthose statistics even better.\nIt's easy to accept things for\nthe way they are, but much\nmore difficult to strive for\nimprovement. Especially in the\nface of people such as Jolyon\nwho seems delightfully happy\nin blindly accepting the status\nquo, without any considered\nthought for the issues\ninvolved.\nYours,\nAnonymous.\nJust for the record, we believe\nJolyon is a man, contrary to the\nbelief of our correspondent.\nThis might be a good time to\nnote that letters are not generally edited except for length or\noffensive content - or offensive\ngrammatical errors. Ed.\nElect-roc uti on Page 12 of last week's Felix\nexplains the ICU voting rules:\n'You will then be required to\nvote by the Single Transferable\nVote System... If you put a1 next to RON, all other numbers\nwill be ignored.'. Why is this?\nIt's reasonable you could put\nRON as your first choice and\nthen go on to give a second\nchoice, if you want to say:\nnone of the above candidates\nis really up to the job but if it\nhas to be one of them then\ncandidate X is the best of a bad lot. This way of giving\nsecond and subsequent choices (in case your first choice\ndoesn't get in) is what STV is\nall about.\nWith the current system, if\nyou put RON as your first\nchoice you effectively lose the\nrest of your vote. But this does\nnot apply to other candidates.\nPerhaps someone from the\nUnion could explain the reason\nfor this discrimination against\nRON.\nEd Avis\nWe have contacted the\nReturning Officer for the sabbatical elections, David\nFrancis, who replied that there\nwas indeed an error in the art i cle. RON's votes will be reallocated just like any other candidate if RON is eliminated from\nany ballot. Ed.\nLEQ-roc uti on Dear Felix,\nPlease could you find out from\nProf Rawlings:\n1. How much did the LE Q system cost IC?\n2. Where did the money come\nfrom (internal, government,\nor private sector)?\n3. Who built it (was it in-house\nor contracted, and if con-tr acted, who to)?\n4. Are departments forced to\nuse the college LE Q or are\nthey free to develop and use\ntheir own system instead?\n5. Would he welcome an alternative system developed by\nIC Students?\nThe rumours I have heard\nanswer:\n1. \u00a340 000\n2. Government\n3. Contractors\n4. They have to use LE Q5. Unknown (likely no)\nbut I would appreciate having\nthe truth from the person who\nshould know best...\nRegards,\nPhilip Willoughby\ntalk back\nThe Hall Guy\nDear Felix,\nIt has come to my attention\nthat Sir Richard Sykes is\nintending to sell Garden Hall,\nin Prince's Gardens (Felix, 25\nJanuary).\nGarden, as is affectionately\ncalled by all its residents, was\nonly refurbished in the last\ncouple of years, and has a warm and friendly atmosphere, with the obvious\nadvantage of proximity to uni-vers it y. Even if you choose to\ndisregard such important fac-tors, you cannot help but wonder whether Sir Richard really\nhas his students' interests at\nheart, for surely it makes no\nsense whatsoever to sell one\nof the only remaining halls\nwhich offers such cheap\naccommodation (from \u00a335 a week in double and triple\nrooms). In doing so, Imperial is\neffectively being turned into\nan ever more exclusive university. Moreover, if anything,\nImperial needs more rooms not\nless. Can it seriously afford to\nlose any? For example, most of\nthe other great London universities offer accommodation for\nthird or final year students.\nIf this plan is allowed to go\nahead, then surely there will\nbe nothing to stop any further\ndecisions to close down other\nhalls. It is all good and well\nthat Imperial needs to raise\nmoney, but at who's expense?\nI urge Felix and its readers to\nquestion the motives behind\nSir Richard's plans, and to\nponder on the implications of\nreducing cheap rooms near the\nUniversity. Is this really the\nbest way forward?\nGarden Hall Resident\nLetters may not be edited for\npunctuation or spelling, but\nmay be edited for length.\nMail letters to felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "LIVE: Cornershop\n@ Scala\nThe venue was packed for Cornershop's first UK gig in four\nyears, and we were treated to new material from their forthcoming album Handcream For A Generation, due for release on\nApril 1 through Wiiija. There was no support band, and the only\npre-Cornershop entertainment came from a sixties-style DJ set\nand a patched-up video of the idiotic adventures of Peter\nSellers.\nCornershop's set started in a pretty strange way: nobody on\nstage, a brass sample, and then the bass guitarist came on and\nplayed in a funky style. Then, the drummer, two guitarists and\na sitar player entered, and a really lively sound filled the venue.\nFinally, a percussionist arrived with the singer, Tjinder Singh.\nHis vocals, added to the sitar and the percussion, produced the\ndistinctive Cornershop sound, typified by most of the tracks on\ntheir previous album When I Was Born For The 7th Time. Then\nsome pictures and videos were shown with some kitsch\nCornershop logos, and we knew that the funky days were back\nagain!\nThe first three tracks, taken from the new album, lacked freshness and fluidity. Tjinder seemed to have difficulty smiling, and\nseemed more interested in his technicians than in the audience.\nThe band were not very subtle when the three guitarists all\nplayed at once; I preferred it when other instruments became\ninvolved, such as keyboards or an Indian bass. Then, we heard\nsix songs from When I Was Born For The 7th Time, including the\nsingles Good Shit, Sleep On the Left Side and the famous Brimful\nOf Asha. These suddenly gave me a compelling desire to listen\nagain to their last record.\nTheir fifty-minute set finished with the new single Lessons\nLearned From Rocky I To Rocky III, which sounded great in a sort of pop-rock style and was almost conventional. Thankfully,\nthey came back for an epic fifteen-minute track (Spectral\nMornings, taken from the forthcoming album), which managed\nto make the crowd dance thanks to a mixture of pop-rock and\ntraditional Indian sounds.\nA pretty good gig, but definitely too short.\nmusic reviews\nINTERVIEW with\nJason Perry from A Felix caught up with the motor-mouth of rock to discuss snowboarding tips, plans for global domination and the release of\ntheir third studio album (see review, page 16).\nFELIX: How was the recording of the new album?\nJASON: It was great to get back into the studio. We'd been touring and promoting the last album [1999's A vs Monkey Kong] for\nthree years because we staggered the release - it came out first\nin the UK, then across Europe, and in the States a year later. The\ntouring was getting to us and if we hadn't called a stop to it and\ngot into the studio, it would have all gone a bit pear-shaped.\nSo now that the recording's over, what are the tour plans?\nI'm gagging to get back out on the road. We'll be touring here in\nBritain over the next couple of weeks, playing the Astoria in\nLondon, and then going over to Europe for a couple of weeks.\nWe'll be hitting the States for the summer, then on to Japan and\nthe rest of Asia for the end of the year.\nAre you on the Warped Tour in the States this year?\nWe've done the Warped Tour before, and it was ace. You get to\nsee loads of wicked bands night after night, like Pennywisethose guys are amazing live. You get to hang out with great people and just do cool shit for the whole tour. Plus, you get to play\nin some crazy places, like this one time we played a Warped\nTour date in a bullring in Spam.\nThe new album seems to be a little more serious, and there\nare none of the short hardcore songs. Why is that?\nTo be honest, I don't think we did the hardcore punk stuff very\nwell - it was a bit of pissing around, and not really what A was\nabout at all. We take the whole \"making music\" thing really\nseriously. Anyone who takes the business side of music is crazy,\nbut the one area we're really concerned about is the music mak-ing. That's it. I think this is the first time we've been allowed to\nmake the music we've really wanted to make, so this is the true\nsound of A. Any chance of some piss-take B sides, like the Owner Of A Lonely Heart cover?\nOh yeah, B sides, we may well do some piss-takes there.\nWhat about the live show shenanigans? Will the snow\nmachine be travelling with you this time?\nYou know what that snow machine smells like? You can just\nimagine some fourteen-year-old getting back from the gig covered in that stuff, and his parents going \"What the hell was\ngoing on?!\" and never letting him go to a rock gig again! Yeah,\nwe should be taking that out with us again.\nSpeaking of snow, have you managed to get out to Tahoe this\nseason?\nWe haven't had the time. We were going to try and get out to\nMammoth whilst we were recording in LA, but we ended up\njust chilling with some mates and shopping instead. We're looking into maybe recording the next album in Tahoe next winter\nthough, which would be great. Recording and boarding constantly for a couple of months - nothing could be better!\nFrangois Ben\n\n"

    "content": "A Hi-Fi Serious\nOut this Monday on London records\nBig guitars tuned as low as they can go,\nplaying a viciously heavy riff - something\nwe hear a bit too often in these nu-metal-heavy times. It usually means that we're\nabout to hear some spoilt American brat\nwhining on about why his trousers don't fit properly or something. But not this\ntime, baby: today is brought to you by\nthe letter A and the (album) number 3.\nAnyone not familiar with the work of A ought to be ashamed of themselves. This\nLondon-based band are living proof that\nit is possible to play great tunes, have\nfun and rock stupidly hard without pandering to the self-centred, nihilistic tendencies of a hormonal ly imbalanced\nSlipknot fan.\nYour average A song involves finding a blissful melody, adding some lyrics\n(about how cool they are/catching the\ntube/why Starbucks are shit), lacing the\nwhole thing with comedy sound effects\nand then playing it like a seriously talented Van Halen cover band.\nThose of you already associated with A probably want to know if this new platter is much cop. Well yeah, it is. The\ntunes may be a little more sedate, with\nless hardcore outbursts than before, and\nthe lyrics slightly less juvenile (which is\na shame). But the hooks bury deeper and\nfaster than before, the standout tracks\nsuch as Nothing and Starbucks are certainly the best things they have ever\ndone, and I have a nagging suspicion\nthat most of the songs will be taken to a new dimension in a live setting, where\nthis band really shine.\n[See page 18 for an interview with lead\nsinger Jason Perry.]\nBen\nTimo Maas\nLoud\nOut this Monday on Perfecto records\nThis album came with an impressive\nDVD case and stickers, so of course I instantly agreed to review it. Though I had been impressed with Timo's music\nbefore, notably his wicked remix of\nAzzido Da Bass' Doom's Night, I wasn't sure what I would get from this album. I shouldn't have worried.\nUnsure as to which dance category\nthis album falls into, I checked the biography - apparently it's \"wet and hard!\"\nI'd say it's got a bit of trance, house, progressive and breakbeat - so, basically,\nthis is for anyone who likes dance.\nThe two big collaborations on this\nalbum are with Kelis and Finley Quaye.\nOK, so Finley might not have released\nanything for a very long time, but he's still out on the scene. His track Caravan\nis very spiritual, with his usual soothing\nvocals. The Kelis track Help Me has a mysterious beat in the background and a general ghostly feel to it.\nThe new single To Get Down will be a floor-filler, with its funky beats and\nwicked guitar riff. Another highlight is\nThat's How I 've Been Dancin', which has\ngreat vocals and an awesome beat.\nI definitely prefer the real house tracks\non the album - the slower beats just drag\non a little bit too long. The only other criticism I have is of the track arrangement -the tempo of adjacent tracks seems to\ndiffer dramatically, and perhaps a slow\nprogression would have been better.\nOverall, a great album with funky\nbeats and not a single song that I dislike.\nLoud will definitely enhance Timo Maas'\nstatus as an artist, and I hope to hear\nsome of these tracks when out clubbing.\nOscar\nmusic reviews\n...Trail Of Dead\nSource Tags and Codes\nOut this Monday on Interscope records\nThe third album from Texan rock misfits\n...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of\nDead has the same underground rock\nethic as their previous releases, the\neponymous .. .AYWKUBTTOD and\nMadonna.\nListening to this kind of music makes\nme feel like I 've lost something. I'm not\nsure what, but as all those guitar chords,\nimpassioned vocals and frantic drums\ncome at me, I feel strangely disconnect-ed, as though I should be having a moving experience, but I'm actually not. Or\nmaybe the sheer intensity of a band like\n...Trail of Dead requires more than just a brief listen - perhaps you have to really\nfeel the music before you can appreciate\nit fully. Or maybe they're just not as good\nas other rock bands.\nThis album certainly grows on you.\nThe first listen just flows over me, and it\ntakes a while to get into the whole thing.\nI think the people who would get the\nmost out of this are those who really live\nand breathe rock and guitars - essential-ly, it's one for the fans. Because this is\nquite hardcore. Not in an overwhelmingly heavy Mudvayne/Carcass kind of way,\nbut in a strangely disjointed manner.\nYou'll be listening to psychotic power\nchords, and then some French folk music\nwill pop up.\nOccasionally loud, occasionally sensitive, often an the mic and sometimes\ntending towards the self-indulgent, this\nalbum is full of surprises and never con-vent ional. Not for all tastes, but if you like\nrock and you like something a bit different (you know who you are), then I would\nrecommend .. .Trail of Dead.\nTomX\n\n"

    "content": "books reviews\nThe Shape of Snakes\nMinette Walters\nOn a rainy night in a lower class London suburb, Mrs\nRanelagh unexpectedly stumbles across an old black woman,\nAnnie Butts, lying at the side of the road. Mad Annie is the\nneighbourhood enigma, the local cat lady, who often seems\ndrunk and disoriented, and who is fiercely paranoid. As she\nlooks at Annie's bruised body and into her eyes, she is convinced that Annie has been murdered. The police and the rest\nof the neighbourhood, including Ranelagh's husband and her\nbest friend, insist Annie was simply the victim of a hit and\nrun driver. However Mrs Ranelagh, who is already struggling\nwith a troubled marriage, vows to prove otherwise. She\nwants justice. Or does she merely want revenge?\nIn this dark novel, the true stories of Annie and Mrs\nRanelagh, finally surface. For example, the misunderstood\nAnnie was a victim of Tourette's Syndrome, harassment, and\nprobably racism. Her possessions have been stolen, her cats\nthreatened. In her painstaking twenty year investigation of\nAnnie's death, Ranelagh uncovers layer upon layer of deceptions - wife and husband abuse, vicious assault and rape,\nmarital indifference and infidelity, and thoughtless cruelty to\nanimals and children. In this novel, no one, including best\nfriends, husbands, and seemingly good Samaritans, are quite\nwhat they seem.\nHowever, Walters does not merely create and solve an\nintriguing mystery. As each revelation in the solution of\nAnnie's murder occurs, the perceptive reader comes to question anyone's ability to easily recognise or prevent evil. As Walters says, like the shape of snake's heads, evil too comes\nin many subtle forms. Through her skilled, thoughtful writing,\nWalters breathes life into many difficult, ethical questions,\nsuch as: Why do people hate so illogically anything which is\ndifferent? How do violence, cruelty, and racism become an\nintegral part of a child's life? Are only parents to blame?\nFortunately Miss Walters offers hope; some good people do\ncare; and some adults overcome part of the horrors of their\npast. Without a doubt, this complex, m esme rising, and often\ndisturbing novel is one of Minette Walters' best.\nDIALOGUES\nOF THE DEAD Dialogues of the Dead\nReginald Hill\nA short-story contest for the local newspaper brings more\ncontestants than anyone had expected. One of them submits\nthe distasteful \"The First Dialogue,\" which recounts the death\nby drowning of a nice man while the writer looks on and\ndoesn't help. A day or so later a news item appears in the\npaper describing the incident in detail. The readers dismiss it\nuntil \"The Second Dialogue\" appears in their mail sack and a similar news item is found in the newspaper. By the time of\n\"The Third Dialogue\" the police are involved with a murder\ninvestigation. The writer of the Dialogues is dubbed the\n\"Wordman\" and the chase is on. The only problem is that the\nWordman is an extremely cunning killer as well as a word-smith without equal - and in all that he does he seems to by\ntoying with the police and media. The text of both the\n\"Dialogues\" and the novel are rife with wordplay and obscure\nwords. Have an unabridged dictionary (preferably the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary if possible - it plays a role in the book)\nhandy if you are the type that feels compelled to look up\nunknown words.\nAlthough Dalziel, Pascoe and Wield play prominent roles,\nthe spotlight is taken by the rookie DC Bowler (known as\n\"Hat\" - another of the myriad of word plays in the novel) and\nthe librarian Rye Pomona. Much of the story and investigation\nare told through their eyes, and a more likeable and interesting pair you'll be hard pressed to find in Hill'so eu vre. Hill keeps the reader's interest at a high peak wondering\nwho the next victim of the Wordman will be. This is a fine\nbook, well written and witty. It isn't as emotional as On\nBeulah Height or The Wood Beyond, but it does show\nReginald Hill teasing and entertaining the reader, demonstrating his literary skills and knowledge without patronising\nhis audience. Anyone who likes Hill's work will enjoy this\nbook; anyone who has ambitions to move beyond conventional detective fiction will find this an entry into a new world;\nand those who regard serial novels and detective fiction as an\nunimportant genre will discover how the constraints of form\ncan be used to hold together an impressive piece of work.\n\n"

    "content": "clubbing reviews\nThe Gallery\n@ Turnmills\nIt's the day after Bedrock's first night of\nthe year, and I'm strung out. But I'm at\nThe Gallery, so it doesn't matter any\nmore. An up-for-partying crowd almost\nfill the floor even when it hasn't really\nkicked off yet. There aren't any glow-sticks here, but everyone wears bright\nenough clothing to get picked out artistically by the lasers.\nWhat is really noticeable is the scary\nlack of attitude at this place, even when\ndrinks are spilt over people or they bump\ninto each other.\nOne o 'clock: Max Graham transports\nthe crowd to Planet Turnmills, a place\nwhere premium bang in', funky, trip py house is dropped and where the DJ makes us dance like we're on the points\nof his Technics needles. I carry on dancing and jumping and yelling and whooping and cheering and throwing down\nmoves I never knew I had. It's like I'm on\ncoke and not caffeine. Amongst the sonic\nchaos, I recognise the new Trisco track\nand soon we have waves upon waves of\ntough-nut, sledgehammer beats to shake\nthe kidneys and intestines of the Gallery\nmassive some more. This is aston king dance marathon to shake off the working\nweek - or whatever your problems are.\nThe synth bass starts to shake the\nroom (and my ears), but I'm in the zone\nnow. The pounding high-impact keyboard slab-stabs take me to that place in\nmy mind where I'm thinking of perpetual\nexplosions of light (greatly aided by Mr Newman's kick as s laser light show; he's even having problems keeping up with\nthe music). Right to the very end, the\nGallery crowd are screaming, yelling and\ncheering, and I walk away thinking \"that\nwas a top night out\".\nINTERVIEW\nwith Max Graham\nFELIX: Coming from nowhere to rank\nat No 23 in the DJ Magazine chart is\ngreat, but how did you get there?\nMAX: Most votes came from the US, and\nI'm very happy with that, but I'm aware\nthat down-to-earth grass roots promotion is what helped my earlier career\nmore. I used to send out charts of tunes I thought were hot to Hope Records regularly, so they knew my name, and that\nway I established a relationship in order\nto access new promos for the progressive\nsound which hadn't really taken off in\nCanada at the time. In the end, they were\nlike \"the Canadian guy's on the phone\nabout the charts\", because I bugged\nthem so much, but when I needed the\nrecords I got them and when I started\nsending my own demos around, I was\nalready known thanks to my legwork,\nand that's really paid off for me.\nTransport 4 [a double CD mixed by\nGraham] was named as one of the compilations of the year by M8 magazine,\nbut the first review from DJ magazine\ncriticised its lack of emotion compared\nto other mix CDs and the fact that it\nbanged it out from start to finish. Your\nfeelings on that, Max?\nThat's how I play. You can't be anyone\nother than yourself when you're mixing;\nif it's not you then it won't be any good. I had to be myself rather than fit the brand\ntoo closely or sound like some other DJ.\nIn general, trying to permanently change\nyour sound too quickly according to what\nyou think is the next big thing just makes\nyou sound terrible, because it's just not\nyou.\nYou've been DJing, making tunes and remixing in stacks since you broke\nthrough with Bar None in the UK. What's in store for the future?\nI'm90% DJing and 10% producing at the\nmoment. I only started producing to further my DJing career - ideally I'dD J rather than produce. I love all that. My newest tune, Crank, is signed and out in\nthe spring. The next mix CD, the followup to Transport, is also slated for around\nthe same time, and in the meantime it's more DJing and also a couple of collaborations with other artists and DJs who I really respect.\nCanada's your home, but how do\ncrowds react differently across the\nworld, and in Ibiza are they really just\none big melting pot?\nIsrael goes off, Tokyo goes off, New York\ngoes off, London goes off - but y 'know\nwhat? Every club and every crowd eventually becomes the same.\nThis is your second Turnmills gig at\nThe Gallery, so what attracted you here\nin the first place, and what drew you\nback?\nTimo Maas, actually. He was lined up to\nplay and said to the management, \"I 'll do\nit, but this other DJ I know needs to play\nhere as well\", and he got me the gig. I loved it. After six weeks off [from New Year 2002], I was really itching to get\nback here and play again. It's really just\nthe crazy party vibe of the place that\nbrought me back - the crowd here always\nappreciate you.\nKen Ken\n\n"

    "content": "feature caving\ndrop to the main valley below. Colm and Ed went to zone B, spending time walking\nround the plateau to get a feel from the\nplace. A dump of kit was assembled at the\ntop of the ridge, above the camp to save us\nhaving to carry heavy caving equipment up\nthe steep and rocky climb every morning.\nWalking round the plateau, it also\nbecame apparent quite how many people\nlived on the plateau. A population of over 10\nshepherds lived in small rock shelters. They\ncollected water from the few small springs\nthat could be found on the plateau. Their\nshelters we made homely with a few rugs\nand cushions to sit on. They had a supply of\nflour and oil, to make bread and tinned fish\nfor sustenance. You could not help but be\nstunned by how these people lived. Our\nchef, Hassan told us that they were being\npaid to look after sheep from the valleys\nduring the summer.\nSo far, we had not found anything of\nmajor interest, so we decided to focus our\nefforts on the farthest part of the plateau\n(zone N). This area looked to have the best\npotential and many small caves had been\nfound by the French expedition in the last\ndays of their expedition. While most of us\nstayed at camp to allow Hassan to descend\nto the so uk, Jan set off for an exploratory\nwalk around this zone. His plan was to figure out a good route to get there, walk\nthrough the area, and take photographs. It\nwas a mammoth trip, and when he returned\nhe was rewarded with chocolate cake,\nbaked in our new camping oven. Hassan,\nreturned from the so uk with more supplies,\nincluding some meat! That evening we had\na massive feast, washed down with a little\nwhisky and vodka.\nThe next day, a team set to take a closer\nlook at the area, We stopped for lunch in the\nshade of an overhanging cliff. We had a good view of zone B, and studied the maps\nto try and find out where we had been the\nprevious week. As we relaxed, a shepherd\nappeared. Communication was difficult but\nwith rudimentary Arabic and Berber we\nmanaged (just about). He was asking for\nsomething, which we eventually discovered was a lighter. We gave him a spare\none, and after that all the shepherds were\nasking for them!\nWe explained to him we were looking for\ncaves. He seemed to indicate he knew\nwhere there was one, so we decided to fol-August 2001\nlow him. He headed straight up the other\nside of the dry valley back towards zone B. We could not believe how quickly he could\nmove around the landscape. He was wearing a pair of very old and knacker ed shoes,\nand even with our walking boots, we were\nstill not able to keep up. After about an\nhour, walking past several surface shafts he\ntook us to an innocuous looking pile of\nrocks. He disappeared under them, and we\nfollowed him in. Inside was a small spring,\none of the few hidden springs on the otherwise dry plateau. Just to the side of the\nspring was a shaft which looked to be\nabout 5m deep. A small back hole could be\nmade out at the bottom to one side. He\nwatched with interest as Jan tied a rope\nround one the boulders and I descended\ndown. At the bottom, I followed the small\nhole, for the first time getting totally out of\ndaylight! I sat on a small ledge and threw a rock down into the darkness below me. It\nrattled for about 10 seconds, and then hit\nthe ground. This looked very promising. We\ndid not have enough rope to go any further,\nso I retreated back to the surface. We\nthanked the shepherd, and gave him some\ntinned fish and bread in return for showing\nus the cave. He disappeared off, presumably to find his sheep.\nLeaving the kit at the cave, we returned\nto the camp. The next day we would return\nwith more rope. We celebrated the first real\ndiscovery that night. We asked Hassan if he\nwould like to join us the next day to see\nwhat we had found. He was entirely baffled\nas to why we wanted to visit this desolate\nlocation, but agreed to come with us.\nThe next day, Hugh stayed behind to\nguard the camp, and Hassan, Jan and I returned to the cave. Colm and Ed went\nover to zone N, to try and do what we were\nsupposed to do the previous day!\nIt took us about 3 hours to get back to the\ncave, it was not easy to find! Armed with\nmore rope, Jan descended first, and continued down the main shaft. I followed him,\nwhile Hassan stayed safely on the surface.\nAs Jan descended, we used a tape me as ure, compass and cli no meter to make a detailed survey of the cave. When Jan\nreached the bottom, he had a look around,\nbut it went nowhere. We had found another\ncave with a flat floor - very tedious.\nColm and Ed had had a better day. They\nhad found an area with loads of stuff to look\nat. They had also managed to find a good\nroute there; a return trip could be done in\nless than three hours (we were all pretty fit\nby this stage, and had acc lim at is ed to the\nheat and altitude).\nWe spent a couple more days exploring\nzone N, walking and taking in the splendid\nisolation. On Tuesday, the muleteers arrive\nto take us home.\nThe descent back to Bougoumez was\neasy. We rested at Abachkou, waiting for\nthe land rover to take us the final few kilo-metres, while the mules continued their\n\u2022\njourney home. We were greeted by\nMohammed in the g it e that evening with\nsoft beds, good food and hot showers ready\nto go! The fecund valley of Bougoumez\nseemed like paradise compared to where\nwe had been. After a good feed and a few\ndrinks we slept like babies, ready for the\nfinal journey to Marrakech the next day.\nTim Wright\nIf you 're interested in joining the caving club\non their expedition to Slovenia this summer,\ncontact caving@ic.ac. uk or look at our web-site: http://www.su.ic.ac.uk/caving\n\n"

After piling the pressure on, Holloway hit us on\nthe attack and their player\nskinned Magic,spent from the\nnight before, before doing\nMills in a similar manner.

They were\nnot merely demonstrations of\nhuman physical fitness at its\nhighest level, but of mental\nand spiritual awareness as\nwell.\nWatching Sifu Chen Lei, a quadruple National Wushu\nChampion of China, one\nwould be very tempted to say\nthat truly, there is no better\nmirror than wushu to reflect\nthe beauty of Chinese thought\nand the Yin and Yang philosophy. Indeed, wushu is about\nharmony between contrasts.\nIt is grace and strength com-bin ed; it is both relaxed fluid\nmoves and powerful energy\nexplosions. It can be slow and\nlanguid on the one hand but\nswift and precise on the other.\nWushu is about discovering\nthe secret of a calm mind\nguiding a quick body for maximum efficiency.\n5 hours of intense training\nwith one of the most inspiring\nmartial artists of our times\nturned out to be, indeed, a most fulfil ing experience for\nall those present - for IC\nwushu lovers, definitely an\nearth-shattering sensation.\nSapna\nIce Hockey\nIC Devils 10 3 Cambridge B The first period was the\ncalmest and least eventful:\ngood for the new players still\nfinding their feet, and allowing our more experienced\nplayers to give us a21 lead\nafter a couple of goals from\nMikko.\nThings started warming up\nin the second period, with our\nself-titled 'C.

By\nnow Cambridge were used to\nour ice, with their dwarfish\ncentre making several dangerous breaks toward goal.\nHowever, thanks in no small\npart to keeper and man-of-the-match Adrian Gill, and\nsome nifty defence work, we\nkept a clean sheet during this\nperiod. Our attack thoroughly\noutclassed the Cambridge\ndefence this period, with impressive shifts from all\nthree lines. At the close of the\nsecond we led 7-1 thanks to\ngoals this time from Mikko (3),\nDmitry and Alex.\nDespite a couple of consolation goals which excited their\ncentre enough to stick his\ntongue out at our bench (keep\nit for your bird you hairy tw at), there was now no way back\nfor them. We pulled ahead further with Mikko, Dmitry and\nanother of our attacking elite\nputting three more past them\nto end the game 10-3.

    "content": "reviews books\nm^ About the Author\nJohn Colapinto\nCal Cunningham calls himself a writer, but he's too busy to sit\ndown and actually write anything. He spends his days working as a bookstore stock boy and his nights and weekends in\nthe bars of Manhattan chasing women. On Sunday mornings,\nhe spins tales about his conquests to his roommate, are clu sive, hard-working Columbia law student named Stewart\nChurch in their small flat in Washington Heights. When\nStewart is killed in a bicycle accident, Cal finds a novel - a brilliant novel - based on Cal's own exploits hidden in\nStewart's desk. Cal is appa led, and then inspired. He sends\nthe novel off to one of New York's leading literary agents,\nclaiming it is his own, and work begins on turning Cal into\nthe next literary giant.\nCal is horrified when, whilst looking through Stewart's work for a short-story for a magazine piece, he finds evidence\nthat the manuscript of Stewart's novel was sent to a woman.\nHe intercepts this copy and immediately falls in love with\nStewart's ex-girlfriend Janet, and soon ends up marrying her.\nThe book is a smash hit, and as he claims the rewards of literary l ionisation, Cal convinces himself that he is, really, at\nbottom, responsible for the writing of the book, if not exactly\nits author.\nThe novel convincingly portrays Cal's determined delusion\nthat everything has worked out just as it was meant to be. As he begins his new life with Janet in Vermont, he thinks how\n\"Stewart's ghost had turned out to be a benevolent spectre\nafter all, his spirit helping to shape my destiny, to guide both\nJanet and me to this moment.\" Which is all well and good,\nuntil Cal discovers that someone else is in possession of a copy of the original manuscript.\nThis novel is very much in the style of the Thomas Ripley\nnovels by Patricia Highsmith, with its very dark, almost noir\nfeel. The sense of desperation that Cal Cunningham feels\nwhen his life is at stake from his blackmailer is very gripping.\nThis is John Colapinto's first novel and is one of the best that\nI have read in a long while, with an excellent prose style and\na really satisfying ending.\nmm\nBitterroot\nJames Lee Burke\nBilly Bob Holland, ex-Texas Ranger and now an attorney, goes\nto Montana to visit his friend Doc Voss. However, the visit\nturns into a working vacation when Voss is arrested for the\nmurder of a biker who participated in the gang rape of his\nyoung daughter. Voss has been active in speaking out against\na company dumping cyanide into the river of the Bitterroot\nValley, as well as ant agonising the local right-wing militia. He\nalso had a confrontation with the biker prior to his murder.\nVoss is not the only one with a problem, though. There is a killer in Montana, newly released from prison, who is tracking\nHolland. He holds the attorney responsible for his sister's death and intends to make Holland pay for it. The FBI is also\nplanting informants in some of these anti-social groups in an\neffort to determine if it can learn more about the Oklahoma\nCity bombing, and Holland works to play these groups off\nagainst each other. Throw in some mob-connected villains and\nthe author has indeed created a dangerous mixture for all con-cern ed. Burke is perhaps the most poetic crime writer currently\nworking in America. His ability to paint a portrait with words\nis unsurpassed, offering the reader a true visual feel for the\nsettings and the characters. While all those in the novel are\nwell drawn, the standout is Billy Bob himself. Haunted with\nguilt over the accidental shooting of his partner, Holland sees\nhis ghost everywhere - in fact, he actually looks for the spirit\nto appear so he can discuss his life, as well as the case, with\nhim. Further, the author has constructed an engrossing tale of\nmystery that is not for the faint of heart.\nThe Shape of Snakes is published by Pan, \u00a36.99\nDialogues of the Dead is published by Collins, \u00a36.99\nAbout the Author is published by 4th Estate, \u00a310\nBitterroot is published by Orion, \u00a312.99\nAll these books are out now and would make excellent reading during the coming Easter break - not as a substitute for\nrevision but as a wonderful supplement to it.\n\n"

Spirits were high as the\nRSM were on their way to\nhumiliate a bunch of Cornish\nretards - Camborne School of\nMines - for the sixth year in a row.\nWe settled on to the coach,\nand were introduced to Dean,\nour driver for the weekend,\nand no sooner had we reached\nQueens Gate, Jim\" The Panther\" Mccuscker produced\na pom stash that would rival\nthe contents of any Soho sex\nshop. Somewhere near Exeter,\nFlo decided that everyone was in need of a bit of light enter-tain ment, Light it wasn't, Dean couldn't keep his eyes on\nthe road and the bus swerved\nwildly across the motorway,\n(think two marrows being\nforced in as martie s tube). We\narrived in Newquay to drop off\nthe Homosexual footballers\nand associated riff raff so they\ncould go drinking. The real\nmen arrived at the panty-cel-lyn's sister hotel (ask geology\n3) and settled in for the night.\nA Chinese and a game of\narrows later, people went to\nbed, but not before Rhys had\nsqueezed in a sly pint or two.\nThose that had not succumbed to hypothermia during the night rose for breakfast\nand were served by the\nCornish female wrestling\nchampion, and a training session later and we were ready\nfor action. The drive to\nCamborne was accompanied\nby Chin-Choi's musical collection to get in the mood, and a brief stop at Tescos resulted in\nthe purchase of half a Banana\nplantation and 50 gallons of\nLucozade. Following a word of\ninspiration from Dean, along\nthe line that we were to go\nand F*c king murder the scum,\nwe set out for a trek through a cow field and arrived at the\nCamborne ground. Camborne\nwere training nearby, a spying\nparty was sent out, and Henry\nset the tone for the day by\nabusing the Camborne captain Sideshow Bob. The crowd\narrived and the game was about to start live on Cornish\nradio and taped for masses, as\nunfortunately the TV has not\nyet reached Camborne. Segun\npunched a few doors in preparation for a Camborne players\nhead. The game started,\nSegun got an early try which\nresulted in the RS M propaganda minister Brewster bursting\ninto life and announcing to the\nmasses that Camborne had\ncracked. They had cracked,\ninto their ringers...\nA few tactical substitutions\nlater and Camborne were 45\nstone heavier in the pack, but\nthey couldn't do anything to\nhalt the black magic, and The\nAngel Gabriel ran in a try or\ntwo. A passing seagull picked\nup the ball and dropped it over\nthe RS M posts giving the\ninbred s3 points.\nAt some point in the first\nhalf Segun broke his shoulder\nbut didn't notice until Sunday.\nWho knows what the score\nwas or when the tries were\nscored, but half-time arrived.\nSome wag from Camborne\ntried to streak, but he hadn't bargained for the Northern\nstreaking king in the RS M crowd. The Ginger prince Don\nJuan de Christian burst from\nthe crowd and chased away\nthe Cornish pervert before\nbeing floored by a back injury.\nThe display of pasty flesh put\nthe RS M boys out of synch for\na few minutes letting\nCamborne catch up to 17-19.\nThe panther was injured so\nthe RS M secret weapon Super\nBrewster made his debut,\nquite why no one knows, but\nhe provided entertainment by\nswiftly having his nose pul-ver is ed by some thug.

What a surprise, we won again the final score 17-29 to\nthe RSM.\nThe drinking began in earnest, Henry was live on\nthe radio, a star in the making.\nWe went to a dinner, where\nthere was a lack of wine so we sent someone down the off\nlicense thing descended into\nanarchy, lots of people had\nbirthdays and Brewster\nchucked the flower arrangement at some Horn from\nCamborne football and announced Henrys engage-ment, which was news to him.\nBalson entertained the local\nladies, to put it mildly. We\ndrank some more there were\nsome fireworks and then it all\nwent a bit hazy.

    "content": "caving feature\nThe Caves Of Morocco\nIn the early eighties a French team explored\na high plateau near Jbel Ghat, (Jbel *\u00bb\nMountain, Ghat. The 'Gh' is pronounced as\na throaty R sound). The plateau is surrounded by a horseshoe shaped ridge, the\npeak of which is just below 4000m. The\nreport documented many caves, mostly vertical shafts, in several different areas of the\nplateau. The French expedition had only\ncovered a tiny proportion of area of the\nplateau and we were intrigued enough to\nwant to take a look for ourselves.\nfrom the airport and headed for the stunning Bougoumez valley.\nThe most amazing thing about\nBougoumez valley is the colour - it's green.\nFor the entire drive from Marrakech,\nthrough the plains west of the mountains,\nto the foothills of the Atlas, an arid, dusty,\nrocky brown terrain was normal. As we\nrounded the final corner into the valley, we\ncould not help but be amazed by the fertile\ngreen fields laid out before us. This is quite\nan achievement since it's such an en or It was decided that a team of 5 (Tim\nWight, Hugh Penney, Jan Everts, Colm\nCarroll and Ed Austin) would spend 2V z weeks on the plateau. September is the\nbest time to visit the Atlas since the heat of\nthe summer is over, but winter has not yet\nset in. Since we would be staying in one\nplace, no driver would be needed. So we\ncontacted the owner of a local guide,\nMohammed Achahri and he sorted out all\nthe logistics.\nOn August 28th, we flew to Marrakech.\nWe had two days to dos s and sort out some\nsupplies, which we decided were better to\nget out there. The most significant of which\nwas carbide. For those who don't know, carbide is a rock like substance that when\nmixed with water fizzes to give off acetylene gas. This is burned to provide light in\nthe caves. In less developed countries it is\nnormally found quite easily since it is used\nfor lighting and welding, but we were not\nso lucky, and had to engage in some very\nshady dealings before we were supplied\nwith what we needed. It felt like we were\nbuying crack.\nThe other supplies, however, were easy\nto get from various stalls, and on Saturday\nwe met our driver, Lassan, picked up Jan\nmou s valley, supporting a population of\nmany thousands, but with a single large\nstream as the only water supply.\nThe next morning we travelled by lan-drover to Abachkou where we swapped\nfour wheels for four legs. By the time we\nreached Abachkou, it was 3:00pm, so we\nwould not be able to reach our destination\nthat day.\nAll the kit for six people for 2V4 weeks\nwas loaded onto just four mules, a sight\nthat has to be seen to be believed. We\nwalked carrying only water and cameras\nfor about three hours, following a small\ntrack along the river and passing small villages made up of mud huts. The only way\nwe knew we were in the 20th century was\nthe occasional solar panel, or satellite dish\npeeking from a window. This really was\nvery isolated, so enchanting - we loved it.\nEventually the source of the river was\nreached, a bubbling spring emerging from\nthe stones. The dry riverbed stretched off\ninto the distance. The muleteers had never\nbeen here before, and did not know where\nto find water further on - so this was the\ncamping spot for the evening. Hie plateau\nwas still another 8km.( and 1200m higher).\nThat evening, the massive communal\ntent was put up. The chef and muleteers\nmade us dinner while we relaxed, studied\nthe maps and explored a little. It was per-fec t, until the next morning at least.\nThe first thing I did that day was the only\nthing I was capable of: I was sick. I got up,\ntried to take some paracetamol and a bit of\nwater - but my stomach was having none of\nit. At 9:30am, the sun was rising fast and I found somewhere to rest in the shade while\neveryone packed the kit onto the mules.\nWhen we set off I was less than en thus i as tic, after an hour I was able to go no further.\nI found a rock and hid from the blazing sun.\nJan kindly offered to stop with me for 24\nhours so I could recover. Everyone one else\ncontinued up the mountain. The mules\nwere to descend the next day to return to\nBougoumez, and Colm would come with\nthem to guide us up the mountain.\nJan and I were quite exhausted having\nhad a rough night's sleep and little food. We\nslogged up the final steep ascent to our\nnew home. As we rose out of the valley, we\nleft behind all the green, and entered a desolate moonscape. The only vegetation was\n'hedgehog' bushes (small spiky shrubs).\nThe camp was at the head of hanging val-ley, above the main wadi. The plateau,\nwhere the caves were to be found was over\nthe western ridge of the valley. The main\ntent was erected, and Hassan set up the\ncooking area inside. The rest of us tried hard\nto find some vaguely flat, non-spiky ground\nto pitch tents on. The water supply was a small dribble that filled a series of cascading pools, about 5 minutes from the camp.\nIt quickly became apparent that we were\nnot alone. In the evening, we saw several\nfires. A population of shepherds was living\nin the valley with us. The next morning we\nmet one of them as he beat us to the water\nsupply. His sheep drank all the water, so we\nhad to wait hours for the pools to re-fill.\nWe split the caving area into several\nzones. The nearest (zone A) was the area\njust above the ridge. Zone B was the central\nregion of the plateau. The farthest area from\nthe camp, zone N was where the French\nexpedition found the most caves.\nIn order to orientate ourselves, we split\ninto two teams. Myself, Hugh and Jan\ndecided to visit zone A, and follow the ridge\ndown to the lowest part of the plateau,\nwhere an enormous dry riverbed, followed\nby a narrow gorge plunged down a200m "

(Page 18)\n\"WW- dx rJ Last Chance to Vote Today\nThe election race to decide next year's sabbatical team has been heating up all\nweek and culminates today in Imperial\nstudents' last chance to cast their vote.\nThe most prominent election events took\nplace on Tuesday and Wednesday, when\nthe candidates were quizzed by students\nat hustings in both Wye and South\nKensington.\nAt the Wye campus there was a good\nturn-out, and the candidates for President\nand Felix Editor were particularly carefully grilled. Wye's integration (or not) motivated most of the questions along with\nfunding issues and, perhaps un predictably, fox hunting.\nThe second ordeal for candidates came\non Wednesday in the Union building, but\nwas overshadowed by controversy about\nthese elections' returning officer, David\nFrancis.\nThe first candidates to take the stage\nwere those for Deputy President (Finance\n& Services). All the candidates performed\nsimilarly, usually agreeing both on their\nmanifestoes and answers to questions.\nDavid Francis: Returning Officer\nAt this point, Tasha Newton, former\nUnion President and maybe not as much\nof a College celebrity as Andy Heeps,\nunexpectedly took the stage to request\nthat questions be taken from the audi-en ce. The original intent had been to submit candidate questions through David\nFrancis, some of which he declined to\npose, but she was backed up by an emergency convention of the Union Executive,\nwhich took place near the bar. Regardless\nof whether or not this meeting was valid,\nthe Election Committee decided to overrule Mr Francis' questioning strategy,\nthus allowing questions from the floor.\nAfter all this fun, the candidates for\nPresident were put through their paces.\nThe traditional pints were downed\n(though Mr Francis declined strong audience requests to do so too) and issues\nfrom the NUS to the LE Q system and\nfunding were raised.\nQuestioning for the Clubs & Societies\nDeputy President and that of Education &\nWelfare proved reasonably uneventful\nand were followed by the hustings for\nFelix Editor, which were as colourful as\nexpected.\nThe results from the elections will be\nannounced in Felix early next week.\nAlisdaii\n\"At the bottom, I followed the small\nhole, for the first time getting totally\nn..^I!\" "

This\ngame appeared to wake\nDoctors up, who then played\nagainst the home team,\nLoughborough. After the previous weekend's demolish-ing, Doctors wanted vengeance. In a tight game,\nwith some difficult calls,\nDoctors managed to keep\nHaze to a low score, and\neventually took the game 3-2.\nSheffield were the next opponents, and the Doctors turned\nthem over 8-4. The following\ngame was against tournament favourites, Glasgow.\nThey were commanding\nthroughout the game, and\nalthough Doctors were full of\neffort, and played some good\nultimate, the better team won comfortably, Glasgow taking\nthe game 7-4\nThe next game was against a strong Ow! side from Oxford,\nand ended in a77 draw lea v ing Doctors with a321 record, and a following match\nagainst Portsmouth. Doctors'\nnemesis once again threw\ntheir zone and killed off the\nDoctors' offense. Doctors\nheads dropped, and sublime\ntook the game easily, 6-2.\nDue to a very close group, the\nfinal result of the first round\nput Doctors in third place in\nthe pool, now seeded 6th overall. This was a dramatic\nimprovement on their initial\nDancesport\nThe IC Dance Team arrived in\nReading for the Southern\nUniversities Dance\nChampion-ships, ready for\nbattle against the rest of the\nBig Three (i.e. us, Oxford and\nCambridge). We arrived early\nand everyone had a full \u00a32\nbreakfast courtesy of 'the big\nASDA', which could perhaps\njustify the good atmosphere\nand hence our good results\nthat day...\nFor the first time this sea-son, our Beginners managed\nto outnumber Oxford in their\nLatin section of the competition with 3 of 5 finalists in the\nJive and 2 of 5 in the Cha. Two\ncouples also managed to get\ninto the finals of the\nBeginners Ballroom, so all in\nall, well done to Phong and\nGait, Philip and Annelise,\nTom and Jo, Konrad and\nMelissa, as well as Simon\nand Sarah. As for the Opens,\nEllis and Indika won the\nAdvanced Latin and the\naward for 'the couple showing the most promise as voted\nfor by the judges' (or something along those lines).\nSpecial congratulations to\nAshoke and Bryony for winning the Novice Ballroom .\nThe Team event went well,\nwith every mixed final having\nat least one IC couple (2 in the\nJive, Waltz and Quickstep).\nWe didn'twin a team trophy\nthis time round but it was still\na good day (which was measured by the amount of\nsinging, or screeching,\ndepending on who you talk to,\ngenerated on the coach the\nway back). There's IVDA in\ntwo weeks, guys and gals,\nand we KNOW we're good\nenough to beat 'Watford'.\nCP\nseeding of 13th, and also\nguaranteed a top eight finish.\nThe party went along with\nthe Doctors team, as usual at\nthe centre of attention. Well,\nperhaps not. At least we all\nhad a nice sleep and were raring to go the next day.\nThe quarterfinal was against\nthe oldest club in the country,\nthe Warwick Bears.\nDiscdoctors were very fired\nup for this game, as were the\nopposition. Discdoctors were\non defence first, and managed to force a turnover and\nget the crucial break point.\nAnother point followed, and\nDiscdoctors were looking\ngood. Bears managed to get\nback to 2-2, and from there\nthe teams traded points. It\nwas 6-6 at the end of time,\nand so the game went into\nsudden death. After numerous nervous errors from both\nteams resulting in a number\nof turnovers, and a difficult\nsituation with some music,\nBears eventually took the\nwin.\nAfter this disappointment,\nDiscdoctors played against\nLeeds. The spirit of the team\nwas very low, and a poor performance meant Leeds took\nthe game comfortably.\nThe 7th8 th place match was\nthen against Cardiff. The\ngame was played in a very\nlight-hearted manner, as both\nteams were disappointed not\nto be in the top four. So, final-ly, Discdoctors ended up 8th in the country.

    "content": "reviews music\nAir\nEverybody Hertz\nOut now on Source records\nAir's \"new\" offering does not consist\nsolely of new music, but is a compilation\nof edits, remixes, alternative versions\nand one new song.\nThere are four different versions of\nDon't Be Light, which range from upbeat\nto R&B to a slow, electronic mix. There\nare two takes on How Does It Make You\nFeel, both slow, with a chorus that\nsounds like UB40.\nModjo really incorporate their own distinctive style in their remix of People In\nThe City. The other mix of this track is by\nJack Lahana, who turns the tune completely on its head, rapping the chorus.\nI'm not going to waste much space\ndescribing my views on these remixes -they're pants. The only saving grace on\nthis record is The Way You Look Tonight,\na chilled-out, soft, delicate song resembling tracks from Moon Safari.\nThe CD comes with an enhanced video\nof People In The City. But there's nothing\n\"enhanced\" about it - just a bit of zooming around a city followed by footage of\nthe band at the Mayan Theatre.\nThis is nothing special, and I only hope\nthat Air release something new soon.\nAqua Bassino\nBeats N Bobs LP\nOut this Monday on F Communications\nAfter the likes of Llorca led the way with\nmodern jazz last year, now comes Aqua\nBassino, also known as Jason Robertson,\ngiving us a tasteful selection of nu jazz\nmixed in with a twist of deep house.\nThe album begins with a lovely song\ncombining a soulful acoustic guitar, a deep house beat and a soprano saxophone with some vague water sounds\nthat set you drifting away. You then glide\non towards Love Is Here To Stay, which,\nlike most of the tracks, features the vocal\ntalents of Nikki King.\nAqua Bassino then steps up a gear\nwith Baby C 'mon, a chilled-out tune with\na sample from Sweet Home Chicago and\na vibrant deep house beat.\nOther artists, such as Colin Steele, are\nalso introduced, playing over the general\nvibe created by Robertson.\nAlthough very well made, the album\nnever has a real sense of direction and\nseems monotonous. In this post-St.\nGermain era, too many have jumped onto\nthe nu jazz bandwagon, and as a result,\nthe sound is becoming repetitive. More\nnew ideas and creative touches are\nrequired.\nTobyB TobyB\nALICIA KEYS COMPETITION\nAlicia Keys' debut album Songs In A Minor\nwas one of the major success stories of\n2001. Her new single A Woman's Worth is\nreleased on 18 March. To win a copy of\nboth, just tell us how many Brit Awards\nAlicia Keys was nominated for.\nPlease email your answer, along with\nyour name, year and department, to\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 7 March.\n- \u00ab / , \u2022 # . art*// Wmmk\nVarious\nLong Time Dead\nOriginal Soundtrack\nOut now on Talkin Loud records\nThough I can appreciate that this CD has\nmore than a little to do with the film Long\nTime Dead, I think it would be better just\nto sell it as a Best Of Breakbeat And\nGarage compilation. I understand that\nsome people who saw the film may now\nbe drooling at the thought of getting\ntheir hands on the soundtrack, but since\nthe film itself got such a frosty reception,\nthis superb and diverse collection of\ntunes really needs to be sold on its own\nterms.\nWith a driving mixture of breakbeat,\nfunk and drum 'n' bass, this is a great\nsoundtrack for a warm, moody evening.\nNeil Barnes' opener is truly dark and\nutterly impossible to dance to, but it's just about OK for some slightly scared\nhead-nodding. The standout track is\nColonel Red's beautiful soul/hip-hop mix-ture, and things actually approach the\n\"quite nice\" category with Zero 7's Waiting Line (pic above) - a gorgeous\nblend of Portishead trip-hop and Air key-boards, all caressed with a pleasant,\ndreamy vocal.\nMore surprisingly, however, there's some good garage here too. I find garage\nhard to appreciate at the best of times,\nand there are a couple of average examples on here, but they're rescued by the\never-reliable MJ Cole. Nextisms is full of\noffbeat rhythms, featuring strings neatly\njuxtaposed with a surging bass line.\nWith Roni Size and Krust charging in to\nfinish off the album, this is a great ride\nthrough much of what is good about the\nUK dance scene today. Forget about the\nfilm. Buy this for the music.\nID Derek\n\n"

But I was able to enjoy this movie despite\nhis presence. His performance is not too painful at all and\nthings are helped by Mark Pellington's direction (basically,\ndon't ask too much of him).\nAfter a split-second vision causes his wife to crash their\ncar, John Klein (Gere) walks away but his wife later dies in\nhospital. In her final hours she produces reams of odd sketch-in gs of what she supposedly saw. Then, two years later, on a foggy overnight drive to Richmond, John's car breaks down.\nHe tries to get help at the first door he comes across, but\nthere he is greeted by a gun pointed at his face and a voice\ntelling him he has been expected. The puzzled journalist from\nthe Washington Post has found himself hundreds of miles\nfrom where he thought he was, in the town of Point Pleasant,\nVirginia. The town has borne witness to eerie apparitions and\neye witnesses describe the figure depicted in his wife's draw-in gs. John is intrigued and sacrifices his work assignment to\ninvestigate. More sightings occur and many of those who\ncome into contact with the Mothman become able to correctly predict global tragedies. It is left up to John the journalist\nto explain what is going on.\nWith almost no appearance from the Mothman himself, the\nfilm takes a much more psychological, human approach to the\nun explain able phenomena that surround the main character,\nJohn Klein - but, nonetheless, there is really very little point\nto this film. We don't learn about John's grief at the death of\nhis wife, nothing much is made about the possibility of being\nable to glimpse the future nor the accepted dismissal of witnesses as crazies. There is not much to ponder on beyond the\nleaving of the cinema - but, having said that, I enjoyed it\nwhile it lasted.\nAdam Joyce\nRichard Gere\nPROFILE\nThe star of The Mothman Prophecies has been a Buddhist for\nover a decade and is just as famous for being a humanitarian as\nan actor - although I have only just been told he does acting...\nGere has been one of the foremost and most radical supporters of the Tibetan independence movement. He has even been\nbanned from the Oscars after making anti-China comments on\nair at the 1993 ceremony. In fact, Jackie Chan threatened to\n\"bosch him up\" after the ceremony if he did not \"keep his opinions to himself\" in the future. Chan vs. Gere... China owns Tibet.\nRichard Gere was born in 1949 in Philadelphia. His father was\ncalled Homer, an insurance salesman. He dropped out of university to pursue a 'career' in acting. Initially, gaining notoriety\nas an actor in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), his big hit was\nPretty Woman (1990). After that, his movie career has been a scramble up the slippery slope of anonymity. He has kept himself afloat with such armbands as First Knight (1995), The\nJackal (1997), and Runaway Bride (1999) - which means The\nMothman Prophecies is his first decent movie in living memory.\nMOTH MA NHl Of il ECS ES\nMOTH MAN COMPETITION\nThis week's competition gives you a chance to WIN!

This time around, they've neglected to\ninclude either a decent, memorable tune or some good rock\naction.

Having said all that, and although the A and B sides are virtually indistinguishable, this is well worth a listen or five.\nJess\nTHE DANDY WARHOL S Get Off\nA catchy tune that picks up pace as it goes on, with a simple\nrhythm and strange chanting voices in the background.

Expect this to be on the\nRadio 1 (over)playlist for at least the next ten months. Good Bside, too.\nBen\nTHE SUPERNATURALS What We Did Last Summer\nOh dear! Whatever happened to The Supernaturals? They\nused to be known for happy guitar-based rock, bringing us such\nfabulous songs as Smile and Lazy Lover, but now all we get are\ndrum machines and too many synthesizers. What We Did Last\nSummer is such a mess that nothing can repair it. The vocals\ngrate, the beats don't work and there are too many Human\nLeague noises. Westlife aside, I never thought my ears could be\nhurt this much.\nTank\nALPINESTARS - Snow Patrol\nSnow Patrol is a lively dance track with a thumping bass line\nand electronically mastered vocals, singing lyrics which seem\nto be based on some kind of alpine sport. The B sides are a bit\nof a let down, however - a Lo-Fidelity Allstars remix which\nsounds too much like the original, and a pretty non-de script track called Social Circles which sounds like it could have been\nmade using a Commodore 64.\nTobyB Jess\n\n"

The Council meets at least three\ntimes a year and reports to Annual\nConference.\nNational Council directs the work of the\nNEC within union policy; makes recommendations to Conference regarding the\naccounts and estimates. National Council\nguides and generates ideas for the NEC on\ntheir campaigns. National Council may\nalso pass policy, in exceptional c irc um stances.\nRegional Conferences\nThe eight English regions are known as\n'Ordinary Regions'. Each ordinary region\nholds a Regional Conference to which each\ncollege is entitled to send the same number of delegates as they did to the previous\nAnnual Conference. Regional Conferences\ntake place twice annually, once in each of\nthe first two academic terms.\nNUS Affiliation\nEvery Constituent Member union of NUS\npays an annual subscription fee. This is\ncalculated by a number of means, depending on the number of full and part time\nstudents who are members of the union\nand the amount of money the union\nreceives from their college. The funds\nraised from fees are used to fund the cam-pa ign s, activities and administration of the\nNational Union. The affiliation fee for\nImperial College Union will be \u00a335,000 per\nyear, with a reduced fee for the first year.\nNUS Services Limited (NUSSL)\nBeing a member of the NUS allows you to\njoin NUSSL (although you do not have to\njoin it). NUSSL is a limited company operating as a purchasing consortium that procures deals for commercial services\n(including beer, stationery etc). Imperial\nCollege Union is already a member of a different consortium and it is vital to compare\nthe relative prices offered by both consortiums to assess the value in joining NUSSL.\nFind out more\nFor more about the advantages and disadvantages of joining the NUS, go to\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/nus.\nThe ICU Islamic Society\nPresents\n:m11e4 c:oI oat% bt lilt*4 th,5 th,6 th,7 th&8 th March 2002\nKeep your Eyes\nOpen\nIT'S IN YOUR HANDS \"SUSTAINABLE FUTURES'\nICU ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIETY2 ND ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FAIR DATE: 6 MARCH\nVENUE: CIVIL ENG (LVL 2) 201 & 207\nTIME: 1230-1700\nHtt|K// union.ic.ac.uk/e soc/a cf2002. html \u2022\" imperial\ne mail: thomas.tib bits' a ii c. ac.uk un mn "

    "content": "Stones in his Pockets\nDuke of York's Theatre\nUntil the 29th of June you have a chance of seeing one of the\nfunniest plays in the West End. Stones in his Pockets, written by\nMarie Jones is based in Ireland and follows the goings-on of\ntwo Irishmen, Charlie Conlon and Jake Quinn as extras in a movie - shot in a small Irish town - wanting to make it big. Their\nbid for fame is helped by meeting the lead of the movie, Caroline\nGiovanni in the local pub, who takes a fancy to Jake. With\ntwists and turns to follow, the story thickens with the suicidal\ndrowning of Sean, which opens Jakes eyes to the hostile,\nobnoxious film business.\nThe acting throughout the show is brilliant, Lloyd\nHutchinson, who plays Charlie and Kieran Lagan who plays\nJake, also play every other role in the show. With over 15 characters it may sound as if it's easy to lose the plot, but that never\nhappens. Both actors do a fantastic job at putting on different\nstyles for each character, using different postures, accents and\nattitudes to distinguish all apart: you'll be gasping for air\nthrough laughing at the characters quirks and habits. The\nswitching from one character to another is well done, directed\nby Ian McElhinney, who uses the changes in posture, sudden\nmovements across the stage and other little tricks to convert\nLloyd Hutchinson and Kieran Lagan into their alternate characters. One wonders how they'll even leave stage or do the switch\nto change characters as it is done in so many ways.\nLloyd Hutchinson is a delight to watch as the Director in the\nplay and Kieran Lagan is superb as Mickey, the only surviving\nextra from the last film to be shot at Co Kerry, \"The Great Man\".\nThe first act is full of laughs, while the second becomes more\nsombre after the drowning, but somehow is able to tie in\nhumour around the situation. You end up one moment completely enthralled by the plot, and then the unable to concentrate due to the ferocity of your laughing.\nOverall this play has to be seen: it doesn't get loads of amazing reviews and nominations for awards for nothing, and I can\nhonestly say it is worth spending your pennies on. Tickets start\nfrom \u00a316.60 and the nearest tube stop is Leicester Square.\nToby\narts reviews\nlol an the Savoy Theatre\n'Iolanthe' is a story of thwarted love, and its eventual consummation. In an absurd fairy world, Iolanthe, the fairy of the title\nis disgraced for marrying a mortal, and is banished to live at the\nbottom of a stream. So beloved was she by her Queen and the\nother fairies, however, that 25 years into this sentence she is\npardoned.\nIt transpires that the distasteful stream was her choice of\nabode in banishment to be close to her son. A son! Half fairy,\nhalf mortal (from the waist down), and one who is deeply in love\nwith a mortal - a mortal who is a ward of Chancery. Here Gilbert\nand Sullivan's plot contrivances become manifestly clear. Of\ncourse, the Chancellor will thwart Strephon's( the son's) desire\nto marry Phyllis (his loved one) and the production will end\ninevitably with their eventual reunion. And Phyllis, you've\nguessed it, was once married to the Chancellor.\nThe few features in its favour - the gloriously un graceful, bawdy fairies, or the well-observed scenes amongst the peers\nand Lord Chancellor - did not redeem it. It was difficult to\nengage with the story or the personalities. Perhaps this was\nbecause of the medium - the libretto was often difficult to hear,\ndespite the cast's impressive attempts to enunciate clearly.\nThat, or an essential difference with Messieurs Gilbert and\nSullivan about what constituted an entertaining story. In any\ncase, all that one could feel towards the resolution of Strephon\nand Phyllis' plight was complete indifference.\nThe story line thus dealt with leaves the production itself.\nDeclaring itself an opera, one might be forgiven for expecting\nsomething rather more accomplished and visionary than what\none got. Whereas, at least the cast members of musicals can\nsing, dance and act, the cast of Iolanthe failed to satisfactorily\ndo any of these things. Even allowing for a certain amount of\nparody, we were still in bad pantomime land.\nIt might be that Iolanthe was simply not to our taste, or operatic ignorance rendered its charm to be invisible. The Savoy\nitself, however, was a delight. It was plush, comfortable and a fitting setting for much worthier things.\nLibby\n\n"

    "content": "felix talk\nIC Radio\nICR has shat on the grave of rock'n 'roll\nAt last year's Student Radio conference\nwe were given a bol locking by Sony's Sumit Bothra. Student Radio, he said,\nused to lead where now it was content to\nfollow. Too many Heads of Music were\nXeroxing the Radio One playlist. How was\nhe supposed to plug new up and coming\nbands when all we played was Hear'Say.\nThen he started singing the praises of\nToploader and robbed his argument of\ncredence, somewhat... He also stole our\npizza. What a bastard!\nHe had a point, though. Student Radio\nhas changed; that's because students\nhave changed. But is there really any\npoint in giving heavy rotation to stuff that\nRadio 1, Capital, Xfm and, God help us,\nRadio 2 are already playing? I would\nargue not: If you're not offering anything\ndifferent, then you're probably gonna lose\nyour listeners to the more professional\nstation with the bigger rep and the bigger\nprofile. The level of promotion college\nradio can offer is inconsequential to the\nlikes of Hear'Say, so why not support\nsomeone equally (more?) worthy who\nactually needs it?\nOf course, you can't be a complete indie\nsnob. Well, you could, but you'd be a dick-head. Britney Spears has done some good\ntunes. S Club 7 have done some good\ntunes. But, like I said, they're tunes which\nare forced onto the public in a constant\nbarrage of promo and publicity and\nwhich, to be blunt, appeal to the lowest\ncommon denominator so are bound to\nsell. Besides, right now is one of the most\nexciting periods for music in ages. There\nare bands and artists of all shapes and\nsizes bringing a range of styles and\nsounds that's as wide as the ocean.\nThere's something to suit everyone: Fun\nfor all the family. It would be criminal to\nignore a vast swathe of it, just because\nwe were afraid of leaving the shallow end\nof the, er, musical swimming pool, as it\nwere. And let's face it, Radio l's crap, X is\nOK, but not great and Capital, Virgin,\nHeart, Magic and all those other station\nwith made up sounding names are barely\nworth mentioning. So what if student\nradio can't compete with commercial\nradio? We shouldn't even try: Who wants\nto be like Chris Tarrant? We are in position of enormous privilege in that we're\nnot cow-towed to sponsors insisting on\ncontrol over output, demanding certain\nconcessions in playlist policy.\nWe get to play pretty much what we\nwant. So let's pick up the ball and run\nwith it. If it's a good record let's play it,\nwhoever it's by. It's a big beautiful world\nout there, so open up the window and\ntake a great big sniff...\nic radio P* www.ic radio. com\nWhy I am voting\n7\nNATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS\nA note by David Francis, Student, Imperial College I he NUS represents, and wins, for students. I here are numerous\nexamples of this plotted throughout history, in particular I would like to\nhighlight the beneficial relationship struck up between the NUS and Ul U which has produced outstanding concessions for students such as the\nStudent Railcard and the Ion don Transport Card. Rut representation is all\nabout getting information in, analysing it, and producing significant\nresults because of it. At the moment, students at Imperial can not m flu en ce the direction the NUS takes Imagine a scenario, for a second:\nIn gland is governed by Parliament, but the people of ion don could not\nvote in the Llections for the members or indeed the leaders of that\nParliament. I low can the Parliament ever hope to listen to the concerns of\nIon doner s when it removes even the most rudimentary rights7 I he argument that Imperial's students aren't political (either with a capital\nor a small \"p\") holds no weight with me. If you went around Imperial's many campuses, and asked the students how much they think they should\nbe paying in tuition fees, or whether cr not they should have a market rate\nloan as opposed to an interest rate free one, or whether they think they\ndeserve a grant; I can guarantee that each and every one would have an\nopinion. In the current set up, 11,000 students can't tell the NUS what\nthey want. I believe that ICU is robbing those students of a right that many\nother students at other Unions have. I he government speaks to the NUS.\nI he Research Councils speak to the NUS. I he Student loans Company\nspeaks to the NUS. Who speaks to ICU?\nI he NUS card gets you discounts and saves you money. Now, Imperial\nCollege Union can push its sub vent ion( the money it gets from College)\nthrough many different hoops and around various circles, but by affiliating\nto the NUS, students here will be able to see actual, tangible benefits\nmanifested through there being more money left in their wallets. It's as\nsimple as that.\nJoining the NUS also gives the option of subscribing to NUSSI, the buy\ning consortium that gets cheap beer, stationary etc. Initial figures show\nthat Imperial College Union could save up to L?(),()()(.) by doing so. Nice.\nSo there we go, it's simple really. Shouldn't the question really\nbe \"why wouldn't we affiliate to the NUS\"? Check out the website for more details.\nIf you are interested in supporting the Imperial Students say\nYES to NUS campaign visit www.nus at imperial. co.uk ma\n\n"
