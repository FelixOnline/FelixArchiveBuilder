Heading the list of this remarkable crew are the pseudo-intellect-u als. Let me draw you a little pen portrait\nof one of them. He stands, or per hap t droops is a better word, about five feet\nsix inches tall. His face is not very pre-possessing, being white and pasty, and\nsometimes spot try as well. He is thi in and for some reason* unknown to me always looks as though the next force two\nbreeze {will blow him over. He we fl rs strange clothing, sandals, jeans, sweaters,\n(usually with aC. N.D. badge pinned on)\ni ong hair and an expression of intense\nthought.\nWhat does he like? He likes Brubeck,\nMiles Davis, Charlie Parker, Picasso.\nIonesco, PirandjeUo, coffee houses and\ncoffee. (But he cannot stand Brahms\nBach, Beethoven, El Greco, Shaw. Shakespeare, pubs or beer.) He likes going to\nparties and drinking foul, cheap Algerian\nwine (possibly as a gesture of solidarity\nwith the forward-looking, counter\u2014reactionaries with whom that unhappy country\nis-pestered). He will always give you his\nopinion (always a very low one) of our\ncountry s leaders.\nIn fine, he likes everything new and\ndislikes everything old. His reasons,\nshould you be so misguided to ask for\nthem, will be long, sonorous and mostly\nnonsensical. The truth of the matter is\nthat he likes everything new because it\nis new, and dislikes everything old because it is old. He knows not, neither does\nhe understand.\nOne other thing of note. He hates anyone who plays Rugby and drinks beer.\nThe possibility of a beer-drinking Rugby\nplayer having an original thought, or even\nbeing able to think, does not exist for\nhim. \"Mens sana in sano corp ore.\" is\nto him a diabolical attempt to keep the\nmasses in subjecting. (Or rather it would\nbe, if he believed in a Devil.)\nThis then, is our man, the new man\nof twentieth century England. This is\nthe descendant of those great Englishmen\nof old. I'm sure you will all agree that in\nthis context descent is the right word.\nIt is written in the Bible, a book of\nwhich he has never heard, that '''The\n3in s of the fathers shall be visited on the\nchildren to the third and fourth genera t ions.\" I think that some of our fathers\nmust have committed some real whoppers.\nJ Carter\nThe retiring student Officers: Paul Buet, Mines President, Jim Carter, I.C. Secretary, Ian Hill, I.C. President, Alan Logan, R.C.S. President and Norman\nGreaves, Guilds President\n-fett wd to. the EdUoJi\nDear Sir,\nFollowing the general discussions and articles on nuclear disarmament with mild\ninterest, I am slowly coming to the con\nel usi on that Mr. Peter Young, amongst\nothers is getting slightly confused with his\nt.w n ideas. In one article (FELIX, Friday\nMay 19th, under Letter to the Editor) he\nsays, about British nuclear weapons,\n\"...our bomb B can make little difference\nto the situation...\" and \"...the renouncing\nof nuclear weapons by one of the three\nnuclear powers; Russia and the U.S. will\nnot do it...\" The inference is obvious. I am sure that Mr. Young would be more\nconvincing in his argue ment s if he omitted contradictory statements from his art-i cles. All the same, nuclear disarmament\nwould not solve any problems, for cosi der the consequences. Does Mr Young want\nthis country deprived of all forms of military retaliation in the event of serious ag-gres sion? Can he really imagine this country tucking in its tail and running to the\nU.S. for protection? No!!! If t;e is half a man he will admit he cannot, and if he\nhad any pride in himself and his country\nhe would not write \"...our bombs can make\nlittle difference.\" Someone else said something very similar once, and he was ver*'\nwrong. Did^, not a handful of our men ta\"\non, fight, and utterly defeat that invincible\npower, the all-conquering masters of the\nsky, the German Luftwaffe. Does that not\naptly illustrate that a small power, with\nlimited resources, but with infinite guts and\ndetermination can be victorious against\nheavy odds? Perhaps it would be a different\nsituation in a nuclear war, but it is still,\nalways has been, and always will be, better\nto die fighting, knowing that you have at\nleast wounded your opponent, than to die\nrunning away to hide \"behind Mummy's skirts\" so to speak: for die we must in the\nevent of nuclear war. Because if this it\nis necessary that Britain keep bii ern uc^ ar\narms. As for keeping a minimum number of con ven c ional forces, what does that\nachieve? Nothing. It would simply be a half-hearted attempt at showing some limited force of arms, which would gain absolutely and precisely nothing.- The whole\nidea is ludicrous. The' only alternatives\nto nuclear arms for this country are not\nconventional forces, but a force of highly\nskilled saboteurs. Their operational power\nwas aptly demonstrated during the last\nwar.\nUntil that is reas lise dI suggest that the\nC. N.D. packs its bags and retires grace-fully, for the only thing they are doing at\nthe moment is providing an excuse for\nsemi-hysterical half-wits 'to go traipsing\nabout the countryside at Easter, making\na nuisance of themselves to others more\ncivilised human beings.\nYours since rel v,H. Jurke\nPhveics 2\nThe Editor would like to point out that\nthe Peter Young referred to in this letter\nis not the Pete Young who is Business\nManager of this newspaper and Vice-pre air We ler^. nf R OS.\nDear Sir,\nIn replying to Mr. Young's \"impulsive\nreaction\" to Mr. Finch's article in\nScrutiny\", I make no apology for putting what I hope is a less spontaneous,\nmore, careful thought-out point of view.\nUnilateralism is a very important issue,\nmeriting considerably more than the\nblind, hysterical \"Ban the Bomb\" attitude which so many Unclear Disarmers\nseem to have.\nMy own view is that nuclear weapons\nare an appalling horror, and that the use\nof them against Japan was one of the\nworst atrocities of the last war. However,\nit is foolish to shut out eyes to the fact\nthat they do exist, the knowledge is there,\nand one country after another is going\nto make them, and possibly use them.\nIt is quite possible that if Portugal were\na nuclear power, she would use the Bomb\nin Angola.\nBearing t'.ies e circumstances in mind,\nit is hard to see what good could be achieved if Britain threw away her nuclear\nweapons. In the first place we would have\nto leave NATO, for the Western defence\nsy atom, like the Eastern, is inevitably\nfounded on the possible use of nuclear\nweapons. There may be a case for relying\non American weapons rather than making our own. but this has been Liberal\nand Labour policy for years and is not\na unilateral is t point of view. How can\nMr. Young reconcile his plea for unilateral\ndisarmament with his own fatuous statement that \"if we must have nuclear protection we can have America's\"? Having left NATO, we would become\na neutra list country like India and Sweden.\nBut this is entirely incompatible with our\npresent position as a world power of considerable prestige and influence, with still\nremaining responsibilities for large areas\nof the world. Britain is at the moment\nin a position to encourage world peace.\nThe only ultimate solution for the nuclear\nproblem is World Government, and I hope\nthis country will be able to make a lead\nin furthering this aim.\nWould Unilateral Disarmament have\nthe slightest effect in inducing other nu-lear powers to follow our example? I do\nnot believe this is any more possible than\nit was possible for the widespread pacifism in Britain in the thirties to quell\nthe rising militarism of Germany, or for\nthe present abstinence from nuclear\nweapon testing by the three major powers\nto impose a similar abstinence on France.\nEventually we would be left in a ridiculous position as the only country without\nnuclear weapons, and would be under\nthe heel of whatever country chose to impose her will on us. t No, Mr Young, the C. N.D.'s \"bold, imaginative plan\" is nothing but a recipe\nfor the biggest national\u2014 and possibly\ninternational \u2014 disaster this country has\never known.\nYours sincerely,\nI.N. Guy\nATTACK ON THE\nTWO-WHEELERS\nThe Oonin Bill at present in the pro-COSH of going through Parliament, will if\nbrought tnt n force virtually kill motorcycling as we know j*7 by making thin\nform of transport pro bit iv ely expensive.\nThin Bill, the Motor Vehicles (Pasflengcr\nInsurance) Bill, nooks to make paH Heng crit i Kt iran cc compulsory for all vehicles. Let\nUH examine the implications of this Thf.\ninsurance companies, who are opposed to\nthis measure, estimate that this will increase premiums by \u00a3 1 5 to \u00a320, HO Unit\ninstead of the five pounds or so which\nthe rider pays at present for third party,\nfire and theft cover, he will have to pay twenty-five pounds. Inevitably, this will\nprevent the large majority of those who ride motor-cycles and scooters from continuing to do so, as one of the great advantages of the two wheeler at present is\nits cheapness and low running costs.\nThe incredible thing about this is that\nat present, passengers can insure them-Helves at premium of about thirty shillings per thu os and pounds compensation.\nNo c nae can l>c made for this measure\ncomparable to that for\npj ir f.v in sur ance. The \"third party\" is tue innocent\nvictim of an accident that he could do nothing to .prevent, but the passenger\nelects to travel with the rider; he ii\nperfectly free to refuse the lift, or to insure himself against accident, so why make his insurance compulsory and plac*> this very heavy fina cia l burden on the\nrider?\nThe Ooverment has ',an open mind\"\ntowards this Bill, but because there has been so much opposition to it they have\nintroduced a clause allowing solo riders\nwho undertake not to carry passengers to\nbe excluded. However, fair this appears\nat first, it is merely a sop, and a rather\ndeceitful one at that, for if the Bill i a passed we can be certain that this clause\nwill <\nbe repealed very soon. A similar\nclause in the 1930 Road Traffic Act enabled solo riders undertaking not to carry\npassengers to obtain third party cover at\nreduced rates, but was repealed in 1934,\nbecause rie dr s so covered did have accidents while carrying passengers i legally and their policies were of course invalid.\nThis Bill is both unnecessary and dis-cri minatory. It will affect the motorcyclist and the scooter rider unfairly by imposing a penalty on him which he is\nthe least able to bear. Students who ride\ntwo-wheelers for pleasure, convenience or economic reasons are advice d most strongly to write to their Members of Parliament\ntelling them that they are opposed to the\nCronin Bill instructing them to prevent\nits passage through the House, or at least,\ntu quote one reply received to such a letter by a student of this College, \"not to\nlet it pass, on the nod, as it were.\"\nWHY?\nWhy is it that the normally articulate\nperson when faced! with the prospect of making a telephone call makes a complete\nmess of it? It is difficult enough to get through ; the argue ment s with the operator,\nthe pressing of Button B in order to get\nback into the right sequence of events,\nthe eventual connection, the frantic bellowing \"hello\" on both sides (the poor fellow must be deaf) until you remember\nyou haven't pressed Button A. The call\nis important, asking the girl for a second\ndate, you had worked out what you were going to say, it sounds fine, only you don't say it. Instead you make some inane and damning remark such as \"Are you doing\nanything this week?\" If she wasn't she is now.\nThe instruments make no allowances for captivating smiles and flashing teeth, it\neven twists v our voice round and minces\nit before delivering it at the other end in\na minced-up condition. Surely closed- circuit television is the answer to the problem ; one would be able to see the effect\nof one's remarks and would prevent oneself from ploughing deeper into the mire,\nIt would be all visual, thus doing away with the magnificent sound effects the telephone is blessed with at present: the various \"tones\". Their efficiency cannot be denied, they baffle completely. You're\nnever quite sure whether the girl is in, en-gaged, or just playing hard to get l If we are to live in an age free from\nfrustration, fear and worry, then society\nwill have to find a better instrument for\ncommunication than the telephone, the\nwoman's friend and the devil's disciple,\nthe fruit machine with no prizes, the gadget that musses up so many romances; but\nwh v?

In the\nTideway Head, the Second Eight finished\n27th several places higher than last year,\nthe First Eight came 10th, just failing to\nbest the University.\nThe regatta season started on the first\nSaturday of term with the Third Eight\nlosing in the seo on d round of the Mortlake\nMaiden Regatta to a powerful Thames\ncrew.

R.M.A. Sandhurst.\nThis was hard t fought mati ch against\ns very strong Sandhurst side which resulted in another I.C. win, thus keeping\nup our 100 percent record. In the first\ncontest Cohen fought the s msl lest man\nin the match, a five foot Malayan, managing to avoid tripping up over him, and\nthe contest resulted in s draw. Robin\nBedding then set about his opponent with\ngreat gusto, and with two strong attacking movements quickly disposed of him.\nA black mark was recorded against third\nman Warne, who suffered one of his rare\ndefeats, but a few well-chosen words from\nthe Captain made (sure that the next\ntwo men in the team,- Downing and\nSimon, won their contests in convincing\nstyle. The second black spot was recorded\nwhom Colin Barry was thrown by a balding gentleman wearing an orange belt.\nA good laugh was had by all when Bowles\nwent out to meet his opponent; John is\nonly a mere six foot two inches and he\nwas dwarfed by (he gigantic Sandhurst\nman, but the contest resulted in a draw.\nThe I.C. Captain, Ramsbottom, of neo k fame, then gave one of his usual brilliant\ndisplays, beating the Sandhurst man in\nabout thirty seconds flat, and Shepherd,\nour tame Black Belt, surprised himself\nand the rest of the team by beating an\nopponent only two grades lower than nim-selves.\nIn the return match at I.C. we were\nwithout Shepherd and Ramsbottom, the\nlatter, so he says, having turned over in\nbed rather quickly and bent his neck in\nti he process, to consequence he has to\nwear a large clerical collar. However, the\nteam again won quite convincingly. The\nCaptain did not know whether to be\npleased by the result or disappointed that\nthey could still win without him.\nThe Third and Fourth Eights met in\nthe semifinals of the Maiden Eights, the\nformer getting Jiome b v half-)a length\nafter a great battle.

On Thursday May 25th a Guilds Union\nMeeting was hold on the roof of the R.C.S. Chemistry Building. Tt was thought that\nthis unusual location would give rise\nto some sport with the inmates, but they\nw ro all hard at work and did not notice\nthe two hundred or so Ouildsmen walking\nthrough the building.\nThe meeting was opened with due cer-emo ny: Norman Greaves declared the\nmeeting open, the house roared the traditional response \"Late!\" and the Vicepresident hoisted an article of ladies*\nunderwear to the top of the flagpole to\nappreciative applause.\nAssisted by the President and enc\nour aged b v the house the Secretary deciphered the minutes written in the\nPnder-sep re ttir v's illegible scrawl, gave up\nhnl f wav. and they were passed as rend.\nThe only Correspondence was a letter from\nthe Dean refusing the request for a half-holiday on the occasion of the Field Cup\nRnc e. \u00ab\nWith moving eloquence the President\nrecounted 'lie adventures of the old wood-en Spanner and bade it farewell, and then\nthe new Spanner was introduced to the\nUnion, This is of metal, cast and engraved\nwith the name of the College, and\nweighing between 20 and 200 lbs. ; the\nexact figure cannot be disclosed. Tt is an\nexact replica of the wooden Spanner which\nwas used as a pattern, and considerably\nleu portable, indeed the President could\nhardly lift it. Tt was baptised with a bottle\nof Final Selection, and strong men were\nseen to weep as the beer dripped to the\nground.\nThe now Spanner was put to good use\nright away, n swoop being held to guess\nSt* nMt net weight in pennies, and this\nraised \u00a33.15.0 for OXFAM. The weighing\ndes it rno d and built by the College and\nwas done on a special portable balance\nconsisting mainly .of a plank and a bottle.\nThe President attempted to explain the\nscientific principles behind this in s tru ment, but th p house remained invincibly\nignorant of these, despite his visual aids\nin the form of band-waving, etc.\nThe President closed the meeting with\nthe traditional Boomolaeka. and in attempting to wave t tie new Spanner as he\nhad been wont to wave the old one, he\nnf early \"overbalanced backwards off the j roof. The Vice-president then p no posed John White as Guardian of the Spanner,\nas he seemed to be the only man capable\nof carrying it. To this the President insisted that he .had already closed the\nmeeting, in spite of attempts to convince\nhim that he had only adjourned it, so\nthat this had to be held over until Tuesday's meeting.\nOn the way out, the Guildsmen were\npleasantly surprised to find some members of the R.C.S. Executive holding the\ndoor open for them, assisted by a Black\nBelt Judo, a very courteous gesture which\nwas much appreciated.\nNorman Greaves initiating the new\nSpanner (above) and attempting to\nto lift tt above shoulder height (left).\nFt\u00abC*$ ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\nThe R.C.S. annual general meeting was\nheld on Thursday May 18th. The Preside\nnt, Alan Logan, opened the meeting and\na eked the secretary to read the minutes.\nThis the secretary refused to do and tende\nred his resignation, which was accepted\nwith acclamation by the house. Reading\nthe minutes was pointless anyway as typewritten copies of them were provided for\nali present, who showed their contempt\nfor such trivialities by making them into\npaper darts and bombarding the officers\nwith them throughout the elections.\nThe Entertainment Committee were ele\nc ted by ballot papers, but the election of\nyear reps, and one or two other officers\nwas on more unusual, though doubtless democratic lines. During the Trophy Officers'\nelections one candidate was asked, if he had\njust had four pints set up for him and\nTheta was removed, what course would he\nfollow? With true scientific insight into the\nproblem, he said that in view of the potential energy contained in the four pints, he\nwould consider it his duty to drink them\nbefore pursuing the abducted mascot. He\nwas elected. It was announced that Pete\nYoung had been elected Vice-president by\na small majority in the previous day's bal-lot, and that votes had actually been received from Silwood. The passing round of\nthe beer in loving-cups at this point caused\nsome disturbance during the presentation\nof reports, tho Be at the back of the theatre\nbeing uncertain of the quantity of beer\navailable and the cubic capacity of those\nnearer the front. Our reporter, though a Guildsman, showed _Jr is impartiality by\ndrinking the health of the R.C.S. Union\nwith the rest.\nThe President's Report contained an interesting passage about the formation of\ni European Cultural Community . He had\nreceived a long-distance telephone call from\nParis on this subject, R.C.S. having been\nrecommended by the British Embassy there\nas a college suitable to form part of this\nCommunity. No doubt feeling that further\nexplanation was un no eg s ary the President\ndid not elaborate on this, but reveal i1 that he and some of his officers had attended a week's conference in Paris, on\nwhich he could not report as the minutes\nof their sessions were not yet available.\nThe house showed its scepticism of this\nexplanation by screaming \"Lies!\" and firing a further salvo of paper darts in his\ndirection.\nAt the of his report, Alan Logan handed\nover the coat of office to the new President Finlay, D. MacPherson, who had been\nelected unopposed. Having dealt swiftly\nwith Any Other Business, Finlay conducted the closing Kangella during which\nTheta fell apart.

In Stockholm especially, all foreign students are\nmade very welcome at a club which\nhas now been running for 5 to 10 years\nfor the purpose of providing a social atmosphere in which students who are working in\nor visiting the city are able to meet\ntalk, argue, and in fact do all (yes, ALL) that students enjoy doing to the full. This\nis run by students, for students, and is*\nentirely self-supporting.\nThis summer we are holding a similar\nclub for all visiting foreign students, during the month of July. The programme will\nconsist of a, dance every Saturday (to be\nheld in the Concert Hall) and a social evening (to take place in the Snack Bar) at\nwhich talks or films of topical interest\nwill be provided for everyone's entertain-ment. The start of this whole scheme will\nbo on Saturday evening, July 1st at 7 p.m when we will hold a reception to which\nseveral notable people are to be invited,\nand the first dance of the club will be\nheld afterwards.\nIn order that this whole scheme shall\nbe a success as we intend, help is needed\nin one or all of three categories. First,\nin the planning of the programme, final-ising arrangements and advertising throughout the University and abroad as well,\nbefore Julv 1st. Second, in running the club\nduring July. Third, in attending the club,\nusing the facilities and acting as hosts to\nour visitors. Everyone who is in or around\nLondon is welcome.\nWe are also going to rim a few tours\nor visits for our foreign friends during\nthe week and at the weekend. Ideas in\nhand at present are a coach tour around\nLondon with a guide, visits to Chiswick\nWorks of London Transport, the Royal\nMews at Buckingham Palace and the Ceremony of The Keys at the Tower of London.\nCan you think of any other places of interest to visitors? Call in at Room 17 (Old\nHostel'. Coffee will be provided in return\nfor useful suggestions.\nTo a Briton, our Capital City can be\nextremely lonely place; even more so to\na foreigner on his or her first visit to this\ncountry. Every day half a dozen foreign\nstudents call at the U.L. Union in the\nsummer vacations wanting to meet British\nstudents, and to find out what we do and\nhow we live. That is why this scheme is\nso deserving of your support. It should\nhave- been done years ago.\nThis year, the scheme is experimental\nlasting only for the period of one month\nand if it succeeds, a much bigger scheme\nwill be possible (and required) next year.\nAn example of this is the Stockholm club\nwhich \"Snowballed\" solely because it was\na success and people who had been there\nadvertised it to their friends. So if you\ncannot help this year, at least tell your\nfriends (both at home and abroad) ; there\nwill be a far greater need in 1962. We have\nsome duplicated circulars if you wi Bh to\nsend some abroad it saves you writing!\nThere is a notice in the union Entrance\nHall; please read it (if you have not already done so) and attach your name if\nyou can support. If you have any queries,\nquestions or want any further information\ncontact Peter Hills (3C) at Selkirk Hall.\n50, Holland Park (PAR 7041), or Brian\nManton (3C) at Room 17, Old Hostel\n(KEN 5111, ext. 445).\n\n"

I was talking to Dunn\no MacPherson down at the jetty this\nmorning mid ii e was saying that it would\nbe line again tomorrow because the wind\ny fallowed the BUU. Just a few minutes\nigo old Angus the* postman was saying\nthe opposite. Ho said it would be bad ton\nor row because the seagulls are a J l quiet.\nWe had n grand concert in the Village\nHalt a few weeks ago. Pat the piper was\nwy good, he always is when he has aW drums of whisky. Some young men\nriA j ria g at the Hotel sang a song called\n\"\nIn mo Real\" or something like that. We\n(\nHint' t understand some of the words, Dunn\no said they were French but it was very\n(\nood anyway.\nThe film-show at the Hall was called\n\"\nBen Her\". We all thought it would be\ni bout a mountain but it wasn't. It looked\nlike the charge of the light brigade at the\nbattle of Hastings to me. Anyway before\nit started the man from Kinloch who turns\n(\nhe handle of the lantern said that we\nvo ul d need to put a sheet at the side of\nthe screen because it was in cinema scope. We took a sheet from the washing line\nit the back of the Minister's house, it was\ni bit wet but the picture soon dried it\nHit. Young Effie-Ann MacDonald has had\nmother wee ba irn. Morag MacFaydon Bays\nthat it looks like its father Hugh MacD\non nld but I don't think so. Hugh's hair\nis red but the wee ba irn has curly hair\nlike that young geologist chap pie from Lond\non. Besides he used to go into the house\nlor tea every time that Hugh was away\nit the fishing until last August which\n\u00bbas whan it would have happened.\nOld Ewan MacEwan came down to see\nme last night. He wanted me to write a letter to the prime minister for him. He\nmid that he wanted Mr. Gladstone to comp\nand look at his now brown calf since he\nthought that ho should get more subsidy\non it than the inspector from the ministry\nhad given him, I told him that the prime\nminister wouldn't want to como all the way\nfrom London just to see his new brown\ncalf and any wav his name was MacMtllan\nnot Gladstone. Also he wanted me to put\nin the letter to the prime minister that\nhe wanted n grant to put a now roof on\nthe both y( that's like a woe stone hut)\nat the bottom of his croft. Ho said that\nit was a historical monument because hn n nio Prince Oharlev and Robert Bruce had\ntalked about the battle of Oleneoo there\nHo was quite sure this because ho had\nfound their initials carved on the door like\nthis PC-RB. Also he said that the din in\nthe windowsill was whore bonnie Princp\nChnrlev bad sharpened his sword and the\nhook on the wall was where Marie Queen\no' Scots had hung her st av s.T have put\nall this in the letter to the prime minister\nbut I don't think it will help. Neither\nRobert Bruce, bonnie Prince Charley or\nMary Queen o' Scots were anywhere near\nold Ewan's both y. There was a bit of a commotion over\non the wee isle of Eilean Maol last week.\nThey telephoned through to say that the\nFrasers and the Campbells were fig thing with pitchforks and scythes. Duncan went\nout in his boat with Calum the policeman\nand Dugald Kennedy the jetty-master.\nCalum came back with a black eye and\nDuncan lost two teeth. Anyway they\nbrought back old Campbell and old man\nFraser with them. They had been fighting about who should mend the fence between their crofts.\nApart from that its been very quiet in\nthese parts. Everybody has been putting\nup their \"Bed and Breakfast\" signs just\nlately ready for when the summer visitors\ncome. I must stop writing now the cows\nare at the door waiting to be milked.\nHoots th'noo,\nRabhie MacCheene\nSPRING ON THE RIVER\nI CW A stays clear\nof mixed bar\nThe new mixed bar in Weeks Hall h^s now completed its successful first month.\nAlthough the regulars from Weeks and\nGarden appear to drink moB t of the beer,\na sprinkling of females occasionally adorns\nthe bar lounge. Apart from the draught\nTankard, the main feature of note has\nbeen the absence of ICWArians, so perhaps those who cried so loud and long for\na mixed bar in the past, basing their ar-gue ment B on the Declaration of Human\nRights, were wasting their time after all.\nIt is hoped that ICWA's absence will not\nbe permanent.\nShould people like to see more of Crud's drawings, they are on display in the bar\nlounge, which will be open until the end\nof term.\nI CW A ELECTIONS\nAt the ICWA A.G.M. held on Thursday, May 15th, the following were\nelected:\nPresident \u2014 Anne Hodnett\nHon. Secretary \u2014 Gillian Harrold\nEntejT-fc a in mets \u2014 Carolyn Russell\nICWSC Secretary _ Beryl Milner\nby John Jennings\nUNION\nA*G*M. The President's dream came true at last\non Fridav, May 19th when we had a quo-rate Union Meeting. This was notable for\nJim Carter's long and hilarious minutes,\nand for the resignation of the College Mascot. This was not accepted by the house,\nthough the joke is Bomewhat worn by now,\nand the static mascot collapsed at the news,\nthough rather belatedly. The non-static\nstatic mascot took the rejection of his resignation rather badly, throwing one of his\nshoes at the President: but his aim was\npoor and he did not recover his shoe for\nsome time.\nThe election results are given elsewhere.\nM 'nes representatives on Council were\nelected unopposed.\nIn the report of the Chairman of A.C.C., Paul Davies outlined our considerable sporting achievements this year, and he was followed by Dave Wilbraham and Bob Finch\nwith the R.C. C. and S. C.C. reports re-spec t iv ely. Dave Wilbraham set a good example by making his report last only six\nminutes, and the reports were adopted.\nAs the hall was emptying rapidly by\nthen the President closed the meeting.\nELECTIONS \u2014 Bed loose \u2022\nin the quad\nStrange influences were at work in BeitHall la et Thursday night i when a bed,\nno doubt feeling rather lonely at having\nto spend all its life alone in a hostel room,\ngot up and went for a walk. Having\nwalked across the Quad, it finally came\nto rest in Room 61, New Hostel, after\nan apparently vain attempt to reach the\nThird Floor. This room was empty at the\ntime, the occupant, who shall be name-less, not return ig until many hours later,\nand so the thi rig responsible decided to\noccupy its time decorating the room.\nComments from the two, occupants\nwere, from Room 61, \"That sure was the\nmost comfortable night I 've had in this\ncountry.\" And from Room 17 not a twitter was heard.\nNOTED... Even the great have their troubles.\nThe eighteenth century essayist, Steele,\nwhen editor of the 'Spectator', was driven\nto plugging up one issue with some of\nhis own love-letters, which he passed off\nas written by a gentleman of the Restoration. The present Editor of J?e lix has\nno intention of following Steele's example\nIn this, however, Bhort of material he\nmay be. So that when Felix, two centuries hence, is read with Design and\nWhich? is the in tell i gets i a's stamping\ngrounds, such as the National Film\nTheatre, set in Eric Gill's Joanna, and\nthe Editor is be sei ged with brilliant and\nwit tv contributions and not writing col-nm n bottom-stoppers like this one, no irreverent college newspaper will be able\nto poke fun at it on this score.\nCOUNCIL _ Mines:\nR.C.S.

Congratulations to Frank Irving for his\nexquisitely worded notice displayed on\nthe Hostel's notice-board [in the Union\nside-entrance, concerning the presence or\notherwise of Refectory crockery and cutlery in the hostel. The delicate phrasing\nand perfect choice of words bear the stamp\nof an accomplished man of letters, and\nFelix has no hesitation in awarding Frank\nthe Award of the Year for Elegant NoticeWriting.\nAND IT SHOWS...\nNevertheless, it must be faced that\nImperial College, in one afternoon,\nraised \u00a3 200 more then the whole of\nSaturday's fe te, in spite of the Whitsuntide crowds.\nCan this simply be .explained as the\ndifference between Clapham Common and\nPrincess (sic) Gardens?\nFrom the Evening Standard's Student\nSupplement.\n\n"
