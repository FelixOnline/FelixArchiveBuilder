    "content": "ElETTERS\nOUR\nMarathon effort\nBAG Usual drivel\nDear Sir,\nWe have just read the Xmas FELIX of last\nterm and feel obliged to comment. Aside\nfrom all the usual drivel, there stood the\nfeature article on your 35 birthday. We take\nexception to your remark 'The first issue was\nprimitive by today's standards, thin and and\ncontained little that would be of relevance to\ntoday's student (rather like Broadsheet is\ntoday)'.\nBroadsheet is neither primitive (in\nproduction or content), thin (a consistently\nhigher number of pages over the last two\nyears than ever before) nor is its content\nirrelevant to today's students. On the\ncontrary, if you read Broadsheet you get: an\neasy to read What's on, factual reports of\npast events, Executive comment and above\nall a number of humourous/satyr ical articles\nwhich go together in an attempt to take your\nmind off the lecture you are in. Most people\n(not only 'hacks') feel that the CCU\nnewspapers have improved over the last\ncouple of years and also that FELIX has been\nsteadily declining to what is almost\nuniversally recognised as an all-time low.\nFELIX is neither 'superb' nor 'vibrant'. It is\nin fact excessively boring, the staff are (we are\ntold) disenchanted with the Editor, the\nstudents are disenchanted with:- the absent e of news, letters, editorial comment, CCU\nwritten articles (which have been submitted\nbut never printed) and generally the lack of\nitems about what the students have been\ndoing.\nThe Editor pleads: 'for goodness sake .. do\nsomething interesting!' Jesus, we've just had\nRag Week and does FELIX write any reports\non events? Does it Hell, it gives two pages of\nphotographs with little or no text, no precise\ndetails of monies raised, turnouts to event or\neven congratulation.\nWe are reliably informed that most of\nFELIX (eg pictures) is printed by Wednesday\n\u2014 so it's not even up to date!\nCome on Dave, get your finger out and\nstart producing a newspaper that's more\ninteresting than Friday morning lectures.\nYours\nS Banton and others\nDear Sir,\nOf course the staff are disenchanted with\nMr Rowe when he prints letters from whining\nninnies like S Banton and others.\nP Jarnoyce\nDear Sir,\nStudents taking up jogging as part of a'I'm going to get fitter' New Year's Resolution,\nmight for the first time be attempting a half\nmarathon or Fun Run. Some may have even\ngone the whole hog and entered into a full\nMarathon.\nI should like to ask all those students,\nthrough your page, to consider getting\nsponsored for ASBAH. We care for\nthousands of people who have the handicap\nof spina bifida (defect of the spine) and\nHydrocephalus (water on the brain). We\ndesperately need funds for research, social\nwelfare, special equipment, education and\nemployment training and for our special\ncourses run for young people with these\nhandicaps to prepare them for a full and\nindependent life, despite the fact that they are\nin a wheelchair.\nPlease write to me , Madeleine Legg, for\nsponsorship forms; and if you do run for us,\nthen you get a free T shirt or running vest.\nNot in the least bit interested in running?\nThen pass the word on to a friend who might\nrun for us. Mind you, you could always be\ncarried or pushed round a Fun Run...\nI hope some of you can help us.\nYours sincerely\nMadeleine Legg\nASBAH Runners\n22 Upper Woburn Place\nLondon WC1H OEP\nLooney nonsense\nDear Sir,\nAs many will know, last year saw the end of\nthe closed shop, with compulsory ballots\nbeing necessary for their continuation. Yet\none important closed shop, the NUS remains.\nIt is undemocratic, corrupt and a waste of\ntax-payers money. A movement is being\nstarted to campaign for voluntary student\nunions \u2014 Imperial is out of NUS and that is\nthe way it will remain. So to register your\nsupport I urge all members of IC to write to\nNeil Hamilton MP at the House of Commons\nand tell him what you think of NUS.\nHowever, Imperial's student union is also\ncompulsory and I call upon the College to\ndisband our closed shop and replace it with a number of (competing) student unions\nallowing the individual a freedom of choice. I am sure an ICU more accountable to its\nmembers would rapidly improve to a stage\nwhere the majority (rather than minority)\nwill take an active role in our union.\nYours faithfully\nGraham Brown\nFELIX\nThe scrapping of the joint honours courses in\nChemistry/Management Science and\nBiochemistry/Management Science reveals a flaw in official College thinking, as well as\nmaking the College less attractive to prospective\nstudents. (See report, page 3).\nThe joint honours courses consisted of two\nyears in Chemistry or Biochemistry followed by\none year in Management Science. They\nprovided graduates who have a better\nperception than most, of the realities of\nindustrial life and the role of the manager. In\nshort, they provided graduates tailored to suit\nindustry's needs.\nBut the worst thing that this decision has\nrevealed is how out of touch the College is with\nthe nation's needs. It is producing graduates\nwho are more and more specialised in their\nsubjects. They leave College after being told\nthat they are to be 'Captains of Industry'. But\nindustry doesn't need thousands of captains; it\nonly needs a few Admirals. This is a trend that\nwill become more pronounced in years to come.\nSo while industry's needs are for graduates of\nbroadly-based experience, the College is\nconcentrating its resources in producing highly-specialized graduates.\nThe fault does not lie entirely with the\nCollege. The reduction in student numbers that\nhas necessitated the change has been forced on\nthe College by the UGC. But the way that the\nCollege has achieved the reductions is short-sighted, to say the least.\nThe major sub-committee chairmen and CCU\nleaders are being subjected to a financial\nguessing game.\nClubs grants have already been cut once this\nyear; now it seems certain that the sabbaticals\nwill enforce further cuts.\nThe annoying consequence for MSC\nchairmen is that they can not plan expenditure\nfor the rest of the year. They simply do not know\nhow much money they have got to play with.\nWhy weren't all the cuts imposed at the same\ntime, and as soon as possible last term? Are the\nsabbaticals having trouble adding up? Or are\nthey simply playing off one sub-committee\nagainst another? I think we should be told.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Grenville\nManuel, Peter, Nigel, Dave Jones, Jon Jones,\nHugh Stiles, Hugh Southey, J Martin Taylor,\nTom Osorio, Andrew Causebrooke, Dave\nGreen, Diane Love, Chris Martin, Pete Hands,\nPatrick, Farah, Nick, Tinker, Ian Thomas,\nRosemary and Tony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7.\nTelephone 0\n1\n-5\n8\n9 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

    "content": "CATHSOC\nNorthern\nIreland\nNorthern eland is a prime case of familiarity\nbreeding cor tempt or at least numbness.\nThe 'ti u ge dy:s that it is so near at hand and\nyet so far from everybody's minds (unless\ny c; happen to live there), so seriously a pro bl; m and yet so apparently insoluble. The\nsheer weight of the media attention focussed\non it in the past 16 years has only served to\ncreate the mass of clich es that are now\noffered as a poor substitute for the reality of\nthe war (and its attendant Human Rights\nabuses). 'Shocking, isn't it', 'Bastards!',\n'When's it going to end?' Comments like\nthese emerge automatically from the lips of\nthose suckled on the media's presentation.\nThey are utterly useless\u2014worse in fact,\nsince they conceal the vital issues at hand.\nThree of these issues will now be\nconsidered in some serious detail.\n1. The first issues is legislation. The\n'Emergency' Provision Act and the\nPrevention of Terrorism Act continue to\ncause hardship and suffering to many\ninnocent Irish people and have serious\nimplications for civil liberties and legal\nprocedures here in Britain. Between them\nthey have completed the shift from policing\noffences to policing people. This is seen most\nclearly in the present informer strategy\nwhich has done so much to bring the whole\nlegal system in Northern Ireland into\ndisrepute.\n2. .Then there are the plastic bullets, 4\nin che long PVC cylinders introduced to\nreplace the rubber bullet as a' minim i um force riot control weapon'. To date fifteen\npeople, seven of them children, have been\nkilled by plastic bullets and many more\nseriously injured through blindness, brain\ndamage and shattered bones. The use and\nabuse (it does happen) of these weapons is a continuing source of moral outrage in\nNorthern Ireland and yet the government\nstands by them. What do you think would\nhappen if they were used in the streets of\nBritain?\nThe Royal Ordinance Factory in Enfield,\nNorth London, is at present testing a riot\nmachine-gun capable of firing alternate\nrounds of plastic bullets and CS gas.\n3. A third area for concern is the treatment\nof Irish prisoners serving their sentences\nhere and the women prisoners in Armagh.\nThe distress caused to parents who travel\nfrom Northern Ireland to visit there sons\nhere at great expense and sometimes\nwithout even seeing them, is a shameful\nstory.\nThere is a strong case for the repatriation\nof Irish prisoners. Then there is the\ndegrading treatment of the 40 women\nprisoners in Armagh who are subjected to\nregular strip searches. This policy amounts\nto nothing more than a brutal attempt to\ndegrade them as women and make little of\ntheir political beliefs.\nUnfortunately there is neither time nor\nspace to go into these issues more deeply (as\nthey deserve) but plenty of evidence is\navailable for those who are prepared to go\nbeyond the media half-truths. It is simply not\ngood enough to dismiss these measures as\nnecessary for combatting the man oe vres of\nthe IRA. If we are prepared to seek justice\nand if we claim (as the Government so\nadamantly does) to defend Human Rights\nthen we must not compromise these values\nin any circumstances. Certainly the IRA\nmust be stopped (as must all paramilitary\nforces) in its campaign of violence\u2014but the\nGovernment, too, must be fearlessly\nchallenged when it is seen to overreach its\nlegal powers. And it has manifestly done so in\nNorthern Ireland.\nHaving read this article you are urged to:-1. Inform yourself (as widely as possible)\non the war in Northern Ireland.\n2. Write to your MP and voice your\nconcern about the human rights issues\ninvolved.\nWIST\nFemale\ncircumcision\nWe hope to have a speaker from\nFORWARD, a group who want to make\nit possible for women in large areas of\nNorth and East Africa to choose not to\nsubject their daughters to female\ncircumcision.\nFemale circumcision is a misleading\nterm\u2014female castration would be more\nappropriate\u2014it is not a matter of lopping\noff a piece of skin as it is with men. In\nover 80% of cases it means excising the\nwhole of the clitoris and in many parts of\nthe Sudan, the Somalli Republic and\nMali, also cutting away the labia and\nstitching the wound together so there is\na tiny hole, just big enough for urine and\nmenstrual blood, In country areas the\n'operation' is performed without\nanaesthetic, on Muslim (and some\nChristian) girls aged between four and\neleven years old.\nIn its extreme form the aim is that no\nflesh should remain at all, only skin\ndrawn 'tight as a drum' and a pin hole\nopening.\nMany brides are among emergency\nadmissions to hospital because a husband has not been able to penetrate\nand after weeks or months of trying has\nopened the wound up with a knife or\nrazor blade.\nChildbirth is made complicated and\nhazardous because the mother cannot\ndeliver the baby until she is cut open.\nIt is claimed that if a girl did not have\nher genitals excised in this way she\nwould be too highly sexed. Women say\nthat they do it in order to get a husband\nand that if it is not done they feel dirty,\nlook ugly and smell objectionable.\nNow many educated African women\nare questioning the practice. It is, they\nsay, completely unnecessary and a terribly painful and dangerous\nmutilation.\nICCAG\nHomeless\nin London\nHomeless in London- A case for Human\nRights\nThe plight of thousands of homeless people\non our doorstep, is a prime example of how\nin a western democracy, groups of people\ncan suffer injustice which is rarely brought to\nthe public eye. The so-called 'down and\nouts' \u2014 living rough on London's streets\u2014comprise only a minority of those\nwithout homes in London.\nMany people still come to London in\nsearch of employment and soon find\nthemselves stranded without money\nemployment or anywhere to stay. People\nwho have become 'marginal is ed' in their local\ncommunities come to London where they\neasily obtain anonymity in the metropolis;\nthis may be because they have drug or family\nproblems or that they are homosexual and\nthus 'unacceptable' in their home\nenvironment.\nThe excessive rent charged by many\nlandlords means that only people claiming\nhigh levels of supplementary benefit can\nafford to pay their way; working families are\nunable to afford such costs and this has led to\nthe unusually high proportion of elderly\npeople living alone in London.\nHostels provide a roof over the heads of\nthousands in London but here again the rent\ncharged can be substantial. Overcrowding\nand ill-treatment of the residents is\nwidespread; some choose to live on the\nstreets rather than in such accommodation.\nThe magnitude of the housing\nproblem \u2014 which affects so many\npeople\u2014can accentuate other difficulties,\nsuch as mental, family or alcohol problems.\nThe Social Services are wholly inadequate in\nproviding the levels of preventative care to\ncope with these problems and they can only\nattempt to help with corrective measures.\nThe provision of such rights as adequate\nhousing and standards of living is sadly\nneglected for thousands of people.\nThe plight of such people\u2014who so easily\nbecome isolated\u2014is surely a case for Human\nRights which we, and the society we live in,\nneed to recognise and take steps to alleviate.\n\n"

The appearance of these\ntwelve men in Hawaiian shirts at\nthe match is even more\nsurprising when one considers\ntheir state after the Fremantle\nbeach party the night/morning\nbefore, most of them still being\ndrunk/hungover/still to go to\nbed, and, having walked down\nEarls Court Road, only one\nstopped for a kebab.\nWe could tell things were still\ngoing well for the Fremantle\nwhen we won the toss, so we\nresisted the temptation to go\ndown to the Ferret to celebrate,\nand the gain e began once Colin\n'Samurai' Irwin completed his lap\nof honour.\nIt was a game of two 45 minute\nhalves, played with a round ball,\npunctuated by stoppages due to\na very high foul count. Play\ntended to sweep from the\nFremantle end to halfway to BS's end, and back again, but both\nsides had a few chances in the\nfirst half. Andy 'safe as 'o uses' Reeves, John 'kneecaps' Baxter,\nand Kev 'take a man' Gardner\nwere very solid in the Fremantle\ndefense, and it was perhaps an\nunfair comment on the half that\nBS ended it one-nil up.\nBS changed two men during\nthe second half, while the\nFremantle lined up with the same\neleven. However, the forward\nline of Lewis 'Rawhide'\nWestwick, John 'Sureshot'\nHeighway, Hewitt 'legs' Benson\nand Colin 'Samurai' Irwin\nseemed to have new life, and\nhaving forced a corner, were\ndelighted to see the BS\ngoalkeeper tip Kev Gardner's curling kick over the goal line with Steve 'Frankie' last and\nSimon 'shoulder' Blayney finally\ngetting their act together\nmidfield, things were looking up.\nThen a good pass let John\nHeighway loose, and it was 2-1 to\nthe Fremantle.\nBS responded with increased\npressure, but because they were\nactually wearing a proper strip\n(with numbers!), the Fremantle,\nin their Hawaiian shirts, found it\nmuch easier to organise marking\nthan BS did. John 'silent one'\nGalloway and John 'killer'\nFitzmaurice did Stirling work as\nsemi defenders/sweepers, but in\nthe end BS's pressure paid off,\nand the game was levelled.\nThe Fremantle then made a substitution, bringing on Mike\n'swift foot' Grimshaw, and letting\nColin Irwin go off and drink his\ncans. John Heighway was set\nloose once more, and he put the\nball away. The match ended\nsoon after, and the Fremantles\nfirst ever victory was duly\nrecorded, despite the fact that\nmedical reports later established\nthat the Fremantle team had too\nmuch blood in their alcohol\nstream.\nCheers BS for the game, and\nyou never know, if you'd played\non Hyde Park, you might have\nwon.\nBADMINTON\nFirst win\nof season\nIC v UCL Mixed II\nIC, looking for their first win of\nthe season, were disgusted by\nthe sight of only four UCL\nplayers. This did mean, though,\nthat IC only had to take two\ngames to win the match.\nThanks to fine play from IC the\nmatch was won after the second\ngame, and the final score line was\neight games to one.\nTeam: Susan (Captain),\nHelen, Anne, Phil, Ava, Andy\nSPORT\nREPORTS\nThese should be\nhanded in to the\nFELIX office as soon\nas possible after the\nmatch.\nthe world's most boring student by Finian\nI didn't know that ribe na could make me so\ntid d ly.

    "content": "CFEATURE\nWatch out County\nKerry, here we come!\nDoes a week touring the green and pleasant countryside of Southern\nIreland take your fancy? Does the thought of lung ful s of fresh, sweet air\nand the fragrant scent of freshly laid cow dung make your heart leap and\nyour eyes go all misty? To be travelling in a sociable atmosphere with\nabout ten other IC students making frequent detours to test the fresh\nGuinness. Or to visit all those places you never thought could prosper\ntucked away, out of sight in a Hibernian vale. These it is hoped will\ninclude glassware, textiles and carpet manufacturers. Suddenly, will\ncome home to you the meaning of the words 'Made in Eire'. The fresh\ndairy cream will never have been so creamy, the Guinness so stout or\nthe ham so ham-ish. You, too, could make the journey of a summertime\nwhich very few IC students will ever have dared, or afforded, to make.\nYes, this year, IC Indsoc will be making\ntheir corporate way, 20, perhaps 30, strong\nover to Southern Ireland for a week. Last\nyear, they blitzed the Germans, the year\nbefore, they charmed the Welsh; this year its\nthe Irish, God help 'em.\nThe group, already quite fully laden move\noff into the Emerald Isle to stock up on the\nJamesons and Stout before they board the\nferry, even more fully laden, on the way back.\nThe rest will be history after it has happened\nin the last week of the summer term. The\nexperience will be open to any Indsoc\nmember including any who might join\nbetween then and now, requiring a \u00a35\nreturnable deposit cheque to IC Social Clubs\nCommittee to reserve a place. Cost should\nbe in the order of \u00a350 and is heavily\nsub sidi sed at this price. Jim Ward, Chem\nEng 3 and Caroline Foers, Mech Eng 3 are\norganising the whole shebang \u2014 they're\nopen to offers of all sorts \u2014 so don't blame\nme if they miss the boat.\nTalking of boats, that leads me nicely on to\nthe subject of pleasant cruise a few times up\nand down the Thames. For those unfamiliar\nwith spending the night on Victoria\nEmbankment, I can tell you just how\npicturesque the river and its banks look in\nthe evening and early morning . As a purely\nsocial occasion in the penultimate week of\nMarch, and the last Indsoc event of the year,\nan evening river cruise is planned. The cost\nwill again be sub sidi sed for members and\ntheir guests who are invited onto the boat to\nimbibe in the customary refreshments and\ndance the night away to the floating disco. A \u00a33 deposit cheque is required (to ICSCC)\nsent to David Green, Mech Eng 2 to secure a place.\nAlcoholics Synonymous?\nIC Industrial Society, as you may have\ngathered, does bear a striking, or should I say\nremarkable resemblance to a Society for\nalcoholics. Most events have their own food\nand drink laid on, cheese, wine, bread,\nbiscuits, slim line salad dress sing and so on.\nSome even provide full blown, four course,\npass the port dinners.\nThe most recent such occasion was a business game organised by Chartered\nAccountants, Ernst and Whinney which was\nquite lavish in its provision of refreshments.\nStarting at lunchtime on a Wednesday with\ns arnie s, savories and wine, everyone got\nwarmed up for an afternoon's hostilities in the\nBrewery, Chiswell Street. The game, itself,\nwas fairly typical\u2014putting groups of five or\nsix students with a graduate trainee to form a company. The companies would have to\nmake decisions to outwit the others and\nmake the largest profit on their product. Two\nand a half hours later, though it seemed like\ntwenty minutes, one team lead by some\nfuture impress a rio, emerged jubilant and\nway ahead of the rest. Just in time for some\nwining and dining, conversation ranging from\n'Star Trek' to people throwing themselves off\nthe Queen's Tower and every subject in\nbetween.\nIt so happens that there will be one more\nbusiness game this year\u2014courtesy of Arthur\nAnderson this time, on January 16. On past\nperformances highly recommended. It's for\nfirst and second years; all third/fourth years\nand PG's who didn't play one earlier in the\nyear have missed their chance. Why not fail\nthis year, then be ready for next year's Indsoc Programme? Perhaps not.\nAlso on January 16, next Wednesday, in\nfact, we're off to see the lighting wizard\nThorn Emi in sunny Enfield. Need your bulbs\ncultivating? Fluorescents to be massaged?\nEver wondered how they get the twi ddl y bit\nin the 40W pearl in the smallest room?\nBlinded by brightness? Transfixed by\ntungsten? No idea about neon? Stunned by\nstrobes? Tired of traffic lights? Turned on by\nstreets lights? Wonder when I will go away?\nWonder how on earth you are ever going to\nvisit a light bulb factory? The solution to all of\nthese is: send Bill Chan, Mech Eng 2 a returnable deposit cheque for \u00a33 and we'll\nilluminate your day, light up your life. Come\nwith us and all your questions will be\nanswered.\nSub-routine\nOn February 13, Rolls-Royce and\nAssociates will be at College, courtesy of\nIndsoc. Who are they? What do they do?\nThey don't build cars or planes as would be\nexpected, but design and manage the\ninstal ation of the machinery used inside\nconventional nuclear submarines, no less.\nAfter years of being pals with the Navy they\nare at last coming out of the closet and\nshowing the world who they are, what they\ndo and how they do it. Fearless, Courageous\ndo I hear? Conquerors, perhaps? Invincible?\nperhaps not. They are coming in order to be\nseen, to publicise their industry and to look\nout for potential employees. You have the\nchance to meet and question them. You are\ninvited to come along to find out a bit about\ntheir technology and their work and their\npolitics. Contact Gareth Rowles, Physics 2\nwith a \u00a33 deposit cheque before the date.\nTwo weeks earlier, BSC Port Talbot,\npickets allowing, will have a visit from Indsoc.\nThe foundry, rolling mills and research labs\nwill be open for our inspection on 23 January.\nBSC equipment now 'lean and healthy' after\nMacgregor decimated its workforce and\nequipment in his time there, is back fighting.\nNo longer the lumbering giant unfit for\nNational Service, BSC nearly made a profit\nlast year.\nTim Bird, Mech Eng 3 is the man to\ncontact with the usual gratification. BSC is\ndying to get its hands on quality graduates in\nall disciplines; Imperial has been given\nparticular attention and it seems a great\nopportunity to learn something first hand\nfrom the horse's mouth rather than through\nthe eyes of the Daily Star.\nFood and drink again\nReturning to the subject of alcohol under\ndiscussion earlier, on 20 February, just to\nprove that we can do it, we are organ isn gap... up in a brewery at Young's and Co of\nPutney. However, their supplies are so large\nthat they will need more than the three\npeople who have already volunteered to help\nthem drink it. Apart from sampling the brew,\na tour of the plant and a talk on the process\nand its history will be included. It'll cost you\nnothing and you won't have to drive back.\nSimon Denye, Chem Eng 2 will be delighted\nto receive a \u00a33 cheque from any Indsoc\nmember, so that he can put their name on\nthe list.\nFreebie time again, on March 6, when the\nlast, positively the last, absolutely the last\nIndsoc visit of the year goes td the Mars\nFactory, Slough. On offer is a comprehensive tour of the plant with no limit\non the samples off the line. Free planets (ho,\nho) will not be on offer, but the odd case of\nchocolate bars has been known to find its\nway into the minibus somehow. Simon\nDenye is again the person to contact on this\nsubject. We have been informed however\nthat no member of the ALF would be allowed\ninto the factory alive. Rat poison was also\nmentioned somewhere, I believe.\nBefore I run out of space and memory, I can't neglect to mention the Aston Martin\nTrip on 13 February. No Indsoc program mme would be complete without at least one tyre\nsmoking, petrol guzzling, metal bashing,\nFerrari smashing, turbocharged, four wheel\ndrive, very expensive motor car factory visit.\nNeed I say more? Don't miss it! William\nChan, Mech Eng 2, is the fortunate person in\ncharge of this trip.\nBananas, I think?\nJust before this latest issue of the IC\nrag is consigned to the floor in front of\nthe lecturer, I mist tell you something\nabout the great nightclubbing, food ing, drinking and womanizing event to occur\nnear to the end of this term.\nIt's all as a result of an annual\ncompetition run by National Student\nIndustrial Society \u2014 SIS for short \u2014 and\nfrom whom came the inspiration of IC\nIndsoc. Each year they run a competition called a Business Quiz \u2014\ninspiring sounding it ain't, but in\ncommon with a lot of things to do with\nIndsoc, the title doesn't do justice td the\nactivity. However, to brighten things up\nthis year, they are hoping to be\norganising a trip to a famous nightclub in\nLondon, with cheap entrance in the\nevening for all those that come along to\nthe National final of the quiz at a sumptuous and world renowned venue\nto be chaired by someone famous like\nBamber Gasgoigne in the afternoon. Do\nI hear a murmur of interest? Does this\nsound like yet another Indsoc event\ndominated by food and drink I ask\nmyself? Is this another chance for a lot of\nstudents to get some freebies in the\nname of industry? This has the feeling of\nanother event which will be\nunder appreciated by the masses\nfrightened off by the title. On February\n27 (before the National Final) the\nLondon Regional Heat is being run,\norganised by Queen Mary College. This\nwill obviously be a more low key affair\nthan the final but still worth attending\nfor the free transport, food, drink and\ncompany. The quiz, along similar lines to\n'Ask The Family' I'm told, will ask\nunsuspecting teams of students very\neasy questions on subjects vaguely\nconnected with business and commerce. If you feel adequately\nqualified to answer such questions ie\nequip ed with an ICU card and abi ro, offer your ser vies at the earliest\nopportunity to the organiser. God\nknows, he's badly in need of it. The event\nwill be for the audience and contestants,\nan afternoon and early evening's entertainment before everyone\nadjourns to the pub. If you feel\nsufficiently moved or indeed interested\nto join those going to either of these\noccasions Tim Bird should be\ncontacted.\nFrom small beginnings...\nAlso planned for this term is a seminar on\nthe running of a small business \u2014 problems\nencountered, solutions to these problems,\ngrants available, schemes to be taken\nadvantage of, all these will be introduced and\ndiscussed. Representatives from the DTI\n(eager to expound their new scheme for\nfinancing graduates) and a couple of small\nbusinessmen will be organising this seminar\nin conjunction with Gareth Rowles, Physics 2\nfor Indsoc. Enquiries should be directed to\nGareth in cone c tion with the event.\nFEATURE!\nAnothe seminar being planned will set up\nFord, Vauxhall and BL face-to-face, each\ntrying to persuade an audience that their\nproduct is better than the rest. The idea is\nthat each side will have time to present their\ncase before an open question and answer\nsession inspired by the audience. This is sure\nto be a fascinating experiment in marketing\nstrategies worth missing an afternoon's writing up of lab report any day and that of\nWednesday 30th January in particular.\nIndsoc members will, as always, receive\nconfirmation and more details of this nearer\nthe day via the Newsletter. All speaker\nmeetings, including seminars, are open to\neveryone. Any other event requires a membership card and its quite a fetching one\nthis year \u2014 yellow with black writing and a rather nice crest on the front. The\nCommittee when they all bother to turn up,\nmeet at 12.35pm on Fridays in Chem Eng\nLT4. The perils of Christmas are past, the\nsnow is melting and the warm summer days\nseem only half a year away. Now is the time\nto get involved, take part, get you money's worth. Now is the time to find out about the\nCommittee, elections are not that far away\nand we're looking for fresher s with fresh\nideas and second years with strong wills to\ntake over for next year. Everyone welcome,\n(especially Committee members!) to attend\n\u2014 no lunch is provided, but feel free to bring\nyour own. If you're not a member and Indsoc\nsounds like it gives a lot more than it gets (as\nit does) and expends a lot of effort to help its\nmembers and the College then why have'nt\nyou joined yet? Membership is only \u00a31, less\nthan the cost of a Mooney or a pint in most\nLondon pubs.\nI hope that this has given you an\nalternative view of IC Indsoc, differing\nslightly from the stuffed-shirt image all too\nreadily propagated by others.\nDave Green\nPublicity Officer\nIndustrial Society Events 1985\n16 JAN \u2014 Arthur Andersen Business Game 1st/2 nd years\n16 JAN \u2014 Thorn EMI Lighting Factory visit\n23 JAN \u2014 BSC Port Talbot visit\n30 JAN \u2014 Small Business seminar\n6 FEB \u2014 Car Marketing Seminar\n7 FEB \u2014 Dunlop High-Tech Sports Equip talk\n13 FEB \u2014 Rolls Royce and Associates Seminar\n13 FEB \u2014 Aston Martin Visit\n20 FEB \u2014 Young's and Co Brewery visit\n27 FEB \u2014 Business Quiz London Heat \u2014- QMC\n6 MARCH \u2014 Mars Confectionary visit\n13 MARCH\u2014 Business Quiz Final\n14 MARCH \u2014 Evening River Cruise and Disco\n6 Friday 11 January 1985\n\n"

    "content": "HUMAN RIGHTS WEEK\nSDPSOC\nCivil Rights in the UK What does 'Human Rights' mean to you?\nThe right to vote? Freedom of expression?\nFreedom of information? A 'just' legal system\nand 'fair' law enforcement?... Full\nemployment?? Unlike many countries\nBritain has these rights \u2014 rights\nimplemented to high degree and fairly\nextensively. The second half of this article\nlooks at some more controversial areas of\ncivil rights in this country. First, however, I want to highlight three problem areas in\nhuman rights in an effort to demonstrate how\ncomplex and difficult this whole field is.\nThe provision of a 'human right' allows\nsome members of the population to abuse\nthat right to the detriment of the rest of\nsociety. Allowing free movement of the\npopulation, assemblage, communication\nmakes violent protest, in the form of\ndemonstration, easy. The right to possess\nfirearms (for self defence) allows for those\nweapons to be used in offence.\nSecondly, how far should the state be\nallowed to go in infringing human rights in\norder to prevent crime and bring criminals to\njustice? Phone-tapping is an intrusion of\nprivacy. Trial by jury has long been accepted\nas the most practical, fair method, of trial, in\nthe UK this right is suspended in certain\nterrorist cases.\nThe role of the state in providing for and\nensuring human rights is constrained by\neconomics, the attitudes of the population\nand other 'practicalities'. Racial and sexual\nequality is difficult to enforce by law \u2014 it is\nthe attitudes of society which must change.\nFood, work, clothes and health can only be\nensured for all by manipulation of the\ne como mic system of the country (and\nperhaps the world?). The 'free market' is not\nefficient in providing rights and equality. A government's ability to do these things is\nlimited, partly I believe, by its political\npersuasion.\nThe human rights scene in any country is\ndetermined by the interplay of the above with\nthe history and political/religious/social\nphilosophy of that country. Thus, one might\nsay, the Soviet economy places more\ne mph a is is on basic needs such as food,\naccommodation, employment, rather than\nindividual fred om. On the other hand the\nWest emphasises individual freedom more\nthan the right to basic needs. The degree of\nsuccess of either system is arguable.\nReturning to the UK, the following are\nsome areas of civil rights where, it is claimed\nby some, those rights are being eroded or\nweakened.\nLaw and order\nNew government legislation proposes\ngreatly increased powers, for the Police \u2014\nmost notably in the area of 'Stop and\nSearch'. Arrests will be allowable on\n'suspicions' or because of 'possible\nconsequences' of somebody's actions.\nThose suspected of 'serious arrest able offences' could be detained in custody for\nfour days without charge . There will still be\nno provision for a complaints procedure\nwhich is independent of the police.\nSecrecy\nThe Data Protection Bill and the\nprosecution of Clive Ponting for allegedly\nrevealing political deception have raised\nprotests from many. There is a case for\nsecrecy in 'strict cases' of National Security\nbut the present situation of institutional is ed secrecy which pervades every aspect of\nsociety decreases the accountability of the\nstate and invades the privacy of the\nindividual. The transfer of information\nbetween the police, inland revenue, social\nsecurity and medical systems has sinister\nconsequences, in our view.\nIf the US sur ives with a Freedom of\nInformation Bill why cannot the UK?\nSexual equality\nBasic civil rights are denied in this country\non the grounds of sex and sexuality.\nWomen are desc rim in a ted against in our\nimmigration laws, over taxation, social\nsecurity and pension regulations, in the\nprovision of parental leave for women and\nnot men, and in contraception. The\neducation system and society deters women\nfrom involvement in male preserves,\nincluding science and engineering cour ese. Gay men and lesbian women suffer appalling\nand quite explicit desc rim i nation under\nBritish Law \u2014 especially in the area of\nconsent, 'indecency', soliciting, immigration,\ninherit i ance, taxation, custody of children,\nand job loss because of desc rim i nation. Immigration\nUnder current law the right of full British\nCitizenship is no longer granted to all British\nPassport holders. Naturalisation laws give\nwide discretion to the Home Secretary\n(remember Zola Budd!). Family members do\nnot have right of entry on even the same\nbasis as exists for ECC nationals.\nMany people have argued for our rights to\nbe included in the constitution (a Bill of\nRights). This would help prevent abuse by\nthe government in that new laws could be\ntested against the constitution in much the\nsame way as in the United States.\nJEW SOC\nJews in Syria\n'Everyone has the right to leave any country,\nincluding his own, and return to his country'.\nArticle 13/2, Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\nThe denial of human rights in Syria has been\na major source of concern in the\ninternational community for many years.\nThe repressive nature of President Hafez-al Assad' s regime and the state of emergency\nwhich has existed in the country during his\n\n"

    "content": "has eliminated famines and fed its\npopulation. Some of the world's most\ndensely populated areas are well-fed (eg\nHolland, Britain), and vice versa (Bolivia,\nparts of Africa). Hunger is caused\u2014and\novercome\u2014by political changes: in land\ntenure, land use, and social priorities.\nIn conclusion, hunger is caused by the\nunjust distribution of food due to the\ngreed and in gn or ance of governments\nand us. The reality of starvation is an\ninfringement of Human Rights. What are\nyou going to do about it?\nAmnesty?\nWhat's that?\nAmnesty International won the Nobel Prize\nfor Peace in 1977 but in a recent public\nopinion survey it came last in the list of\ncommon charities and pressure groups\nwhich people had heard of, with 60%\nknowing that it existed. In another, it was\nfound that only 38% know what 'Prisoners of\nConscience' are. Noting this, and the\nprobability that Imperial College students\nare not chosen for their general awareness, it\nseems like a good idea to inform you about\nAmnesty in general.\nAmnesty was founded in 1961 by the\nBritish lawyer Peter Benson and has three\nmajor roles:\n1. It campaigns for the release of men and\nwomen who are imprisoned anywhere for\ntheir political, religious or their\nconscientiously held beliefs or because of\ntheir colour, sex, ethnic origin or language;\nprovided they have neither used nor\nadvocated the use of violence. These people\nare called 'Prisoners of Conscience'.\n2. Amnesty advocates fair and early trials\nfor all political prisoners and works to\nachieve this for people detained without\ncharge.\n3. Amnesty opposes all cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading punishment outlawed under\nArticle 5 of the United Nation's Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This includes\nthe death penalty.\nAmnesty is an international voluntary\norganisation with members in 78 countries. It\nattempts to meet these objectives largely by\nwriting letters to Government Ministers,\nAmbassadors and Newspapers of the\ncountry involved. When possible contact is\nmade with the prisoners involved and relief\nrequired is provided. The Imperial College\nAmnesty International Group adopts\nparticular 'Prisoners of Conscience'. After\nthe release last June of its last prisoner it has\nadopted a new one, Ivan Staroviot of the\nUSSR, who is serving a five year sentence for\nanti-social religious activity. The group's work at present consists of writing to Soviet\nOfficials to ask for copies of indictment and\nthe court's judgment, and requesting a review of the case. This action is supported\nby research at the International Secretariat\n(in London) and by the sending of fact finding\nmissions to various countries.\nThe action is focussed on political\nprisoners because it is believed that\nconcentration on particular human rights is\nmore effective than acting as an umbrella\norganisation.\nAmnesty is not a political organisation. It\ndoes not receive any money from\ngovernments and carefully vets all\norganisations which give aid before\naccepting money.\nFinally the present campaign against\ntorture, which you can support by signing a petition to be presented at Parliament, gives\nsome idea of the scale of the problem. About\n65 of the world's175 governments practice,\nor fail to prevent, torture within their states.\nThey come from both West and East, North\nand South.\nPOLISH SOC\nHuman rights\nin Poland\nSince the end of the last war, Poland has\nbeen a one party state, ruled by the soviet-backed 'Polish United Workers'( Communist) Party'. The record of this\ngovernment includes the continuing\nsuppression of human rights. For much of\nthis time, it has maintained authority by\nharassing any grouping outside the Party\nwhich may constitute a 'threat' to its power.\nAt various times suppression has resulted in\nimprisonment or killing of its opponents,\nthough more commonly this involves\nsurveillance of the Church, students,\nacademics and \u2014 particularly over the past\ndecade \u2014 the working class, the section of\nsociety whose interests the Party claims to\nrepresent. For this purpose, the authorities\nhave..employed the militia and security units\nmade up largely of former criminals. Threats\nof Soviet military intervention are not taken\nlightly, Hungary and Czechoslovakia bear\nwitness to this.\nThe rise of the popular free trade union\n'Solidarity' from within the working class\nunderlined the lack of faith in the Party, and\ngave hope of an improvement. Solidarity\npursued improvements in health and safety\nconditions at work and was actively\nproposing a radical scheme for workers self-management. Ten million workers flocked to\njoin Solidarity in the last few months of 1980,\nthis number including many grass-roots\nParty members who had become\ndisillusioned with the government and now\nshared their fellow workers' hope for a better\nfuture.\nSolidarity also played an important social\nrole, pointing out problems ignored by the\nauthorities (eg alcoholism), suggesting and\nimplementing solutions. Above all Soldarity\nbelieved and practised peaceful action \u2014 a difficult principle to abide by in the face of\nprovocations orchestrated by the\nauthorities. In maintaining this approach,\nSolidarity earned a grudging respect within\nsections of the government \u2014 a government\nwhich was exposed to be morally bankrupt.\nAs a result of vigorous peaceful negotiation\n\u2014 often led by the charismatic figure of Lech\nWalesa \u2014 political prisoners were released,\ncensorship was relaxed in places, and the\nChurch was given limited access to the\nmedia.\nUnfortunately, many of the agreements\nwhich were signed have never been\nimplemented by the government. Issues\nraised by Solidarity \u2014 including that of\nHuman Rights incorporated in the United\nNations Charter to which the Polish\ngovernment is a signatory, were branded as\n'anti-state activity' and were given as an\nexcuse for well-planned military takeover,\nstill under the auspices of the Party and with\nthe consent of the Soviet government.\nLarge scale arrests of those 'acting against\nthe public interest' included not only trade\nunionists \u2014 the very people who had the\npublic interest most at heart \u2014 but also\nactors, religious writers and students. The\nindependant student union was closed down\nby force, and Solidarity itself has been\ndeclared illegal. Thousands of people were\narrested under martial law, the very fact that\nexact numbers were not quoted exposes the\ngovernment's disregard for the right to know\nwho is imprisoned and why.\nThe official ending of mar it i al law in July\n1984 was followed by the release of most of\nthe imprisoned solidarity activist. \u2014 though\nthere have been subsequent re-arrests of\nseveral prominent figures. Despite the end of\nmartial Law, many of its features have been\nincorporated into civil law, which now\nincludes repressive legislation which was\nabsent even during the early 1950's Stalinist\nera.\nThe recent brutal murder of FR. Jerzy\nPopieluszko shows what certain elements\nwithin the authorities are prepared to do in\ntheir belief that the ideals of Solidarity must\nbe extinguished. These ideals remain\ncommitted to a clear identification of the evils\nin society and their causes, plus a programme of peaceful change w where the\ndignity of all citizens is respected. The fact\nthat FR Popieluszko and others have had to\npay for expressing this view with their lives\nmakes its eventual implementation all the\nmore necessary.\nSo while you look around the other stands\nat this exhibition and here the plight of other\npeoples and read the word 'Solidarity' \u2014\nremember the repressed Polish people and\ntheir continuing campaign for truth and\ndignity.\nThank you for reading this if you wish to\nhelp in any way, please ask at the Polish\nSociety Stall.\n\n"

    "content": "continued\nfrom front page\nwhole term of office, make the maintenance\nof civilized standards virtually impossible.\nIn the introduction to its new report on\nSyria published in November 1983, Amnesty\nInternational repeated the concerns which it\nhad already expressed in letters to President\nAssad in 1979. They were:-1. The use of emergency legislation to\nsu press political opposition and other basic\nhuman rights;\n2. The prolonged imprisonment without\ntrial of known or suspected political\nopponents;\n3. The abduction of alleged political\nopponents from Lebanon by Syrian forces\nand their subsequent detention without trial\nin Syria;\n4. The use of torture to intimidate and to\nextract 'confessions' during interrogation\nroutine ill-treatment during investigation and\nas a means of punishment, and prolonged\nsolitary confinement of untried political\ndetainees;\n5. The use of the death penalty for both\npolitical and criminal offences.\nFour years later, Amnesty was unable to\nreport either any response to its\nrepresentations or any improve m nt in the\nsituation.\nFor Jews in Syria the situation in many\ntimes worse than that of the average Muslim\ncitizen. Syria has a long history of anti-jewish\noppression. On November 29th1947, immediately after the United Nations voted\nin favour of the partition of Palestine into a Jewish State (now Israel) and an Arab state\n(now Jordan), Arab mobs in Damascus and\nAleppo stormed the Jewish quarter, setting\nfire to homes, shops, and synagogues\nburning ancient holy books.\nThe Syrian leader described these events\nas the 'spontaneous expression of the\npeople's anger'. But from then on,\npersecution of the Jews became official\npolicy. During the 1948 Israel War of\nIndependance, hundreds of Jews in Syria\nwere thrown into prison, many of them\nreceiving long sentences for 'Zionist'\nactivities.\nIn the wake of the many revolutions that\ntook place in Syria after 1949, each\nsuccessive regime tried to outstrip its\npredecessor in its hostility to the Jews and in\nenacting new legislation against them.\nConsequently, most Jews decided to leave\nSyria, whatever the cost. Today, only about\n4,600 remain.\nTheir situation became even worse when\nthe Ba'ath Party came to power in March\n1963, and the persecution of the Jews\nreached new heights following the Six-Day\nWar (1967) and the Yom-Kippur War (1973).\nThe Jews of Syria became in effect hostages,\nvictims of desc rim i nation, persecution and\nconstant new laws directed against them.\nToday they are the scapegoats for every\nfailure of the Ba'ath regime.\nThe only hope for Jews in Syria is to be\nallowed to leave. But this is forbidden.\nFRIENDS OF PALESTINE\nIsraelis on\nthe West Bank\nOccupied by Israel after the Six Day War of\nJune 1967, the West Bank and its population\nhave suffered severe forms of oppression,\nrepression and sup pre sion. In 1968, the UN\nGeneral Assembly resolved to set up a special Committee to investigate allegations\nof Human Rights violations in the occupied\nterritories, and has since passed numerous\nresolutions condemning Israeli practices in\nthe occupied terri to res Among the\nviolations by Israel of the Geneva\nConvention were the following:\na The annexation of occupied terri to res. Specifically East ' Jerusalem and more\nrecently the Golan Heights violates the\nprinciple of inadmissible acquisition of land\nby. war. Furthermore the policy of Jewish\nsettlements is considered as 'creeping\nannexation'.\nb The establishment of Israeli settlements on\nexpropriate land and the transfer of an alien\npopulation violates Article 49 of the Fourth\nGeneva Convention. There are now over\n100 settlements with an estimated 25,000\ninhabit i a nts.c Collective punishment especially the\ndestruction of houses is designed to act as a general de tt errant. Houses belonging to\nPalestinians accused of security offences or\nthose in which they lived are blown up\nwithout any court proceedings and\nregardless of innocent family members or\nresidents of the home. Up to 1977, the Israeli\nauthorities confirmed the destruction of\n1,229 houses (Jerusalem Post). Other forms\nof collective punishment include weeks of\ncurfew and closing of un iver is ties such as Bir\nZeit University which was closed for a total of\nsix months in 1982.\ndin the West Bank, political parties and\norganizations are forbidden, political\nmeetings and assemblies are not allowed,\nnewspapers and magazines are censored or\ntaken out of circulation. Politically active\nPalestinians face arrest, imprisonment and\ndeportation. By 1978, more than 1000\nPalestinians had been deported usually\naccused of 'endangering public security.\ne Torture: various international organisation\nsuch as Amnesty International and the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\nhave confirmed the systematic mistreatment\nof Palestinian Prisoners in Israeli Jails. The\nInsight Team of the Sunday Times reported\n(19.6.77) that 'torture is so widespread and\nmethodical that it cannot be dismissed as a handful of 'rogue cops' exceeding orders.\nTorture is systematic. It appears to be\nsanctioned at some level as deliberate\npolicy.' The report continues to say that\n'torturing is done for three purposes: to\nobtain information, to induce people to make\nconfessions be they true or false and to deter\nthe Palestinians in the occupied territories\nfrom resistance activities.'\nf The Israeli occupation has eroded the\ntraditional agricultural economy and many\nyoung men seeking work have been drawn\ninto the Israeli economy as daily migrant\nlabourers. Thirty four percent of the\nPalestine labour force in the West Bank and\nGaza strip work in Israel on a dail t basis.\nThey cannot join trades unions and are paid\nfar less than an Israeli doing the same job.\nOther violations concern academic\nfreedom at universities, the pillaging of\narchaeological and cultural property and\ninterference with religious freedom.\nThe social and economic effects of\noccupation and dispersal have created\namong Palestinians a hunger for a national\nidentity. Palestinians in the West Bank and\nelsewhere, despite their hardships, continue\nto struggle for freedom and security, basic\nrights of which they are denied.\nFood for J thought 1\nHave you ever considered food as a human rights issue? We talk about\npolitical freedom, justice and the\nabolition of Torture but we forget about\nthe right to eat. Starvation is one of the\ncruellest methods of torture and the sad\nfact is that it is a torture implemented by\nman not nature. Our reaction to the\nproblems of hunger are uninformed and\noften erroneous.\n1. 'Hunger is caused by food shortage'.\nWrong. The world has enough grain\nalone to give everyone a US-style intake\nof 3000 calories a day. Many 'food poor'\ncountries actually export agricultural\nproducts while their poor are underfed.\nDuring the 1971 drought, the Sahel\ncountries (southern edge of the Sahara)\nexported 15 million kilos of vegetables,\nmainly to Europe. Four million tons of\nrice accumulated in Bangladesh after\nthe 1974 floods because people were too\npoor to buy it.\n2. 'Hunger is caused by land shortage'.\nWrong. Only 44% of the arable land is\nworked. Much is left idle by large\nlandowners. Hunger owes more to\nunequal land d is tru but ion than land\nshortage. In Latin America, 8% of the\npeople own 80% of the land. In India 22%\nhold 76%. Land holdings are increasingly\nused for export crops , while people\nnearby go hungry. Since 1960 coffee\nproduction in Africa has quadrupled, tea\nproduction has increased six times,\ncoca o and cotton doubled, and sugar\ncase tripled. But Africans are eating 15%\nless on average than 1970 and 20% less\nthan in 1960.\n3. 'Hunger is caused by overpopulation'.\nWrong. In the 1970's Brazil's economy\ngrew at three times the population\ngrowth rate, but the number of\nmalnourished people increased. With\nhalf India's cultivated acreage, China\n\n"

Then\nbegan his lifelong association\nwith the Department of\nChemical Engineering and\nChemical Technology at\nImperial College, to which he\ncame in the same year to do\nresearch on mass transfer in\ndistillation. He joined the staff\ntwo years later as a Demonstrator, was made a lecturer on\nthe award of his PhD in 1955,\nrising to Senior Lecturer in 1961\nand Reader in 1965. The title of\nProfessor of Chemical Engineering was conferred on\nhim in 1976, and he was elected\nDean of the City and Guilds\nCollege in 1982.\nProfessor Sawistowski had a world-wide reputation for his\ncontributions to research and\neducation. His name will always\nbe coupled with advances in our\nunderstanding of mass transfer in\ndistillation and extraction, and of\ninter facial effects at free surfaces.\nHe was also a brilliant lecturer,\nand much in demand as a distinguished speaker in all parts\nof the world. His impressive\nresearch achievements were,\nhowever, almost incidental to a lifetime dedicated to his College,\neducation and his profession.\nThe Institution of Chemical\nEngineers this year awarded him\nits Arnold Greene Medal for\noutstanding service to the\nprofession over a long period,\nparticularly in the field of\neducation and international\nrelations. He was elected to the\nFellowship of Engineering in\n1980.\nHe always described himself as\na European, and he did much to\nstrengthen our ties with other\ncountries in Europe through\nservice in various European\norganisations and his many\ninformal visits. He was a great\n\u2022 traveller, and his interests spread\nto many other countries beyond\nEurope.\nWithin the College he was a dedicated teacher. He cared\npassionately about his\ndepartment, about the structure\nand content of its chemical\n, engineering course \u2014 and he\ncared about every single student\nwho passed through it. Indeed he\nwas an in d is pensi ble part of the\nDepartment's filing system, for\nat a moment's notice he could\nremember the name, dates,\ngrades, and subsequent career of\nany student graduating over the\nlast thirty years.\nHenry, as he was known\nthroughout the profession, will\nbe remembered with great\naffection by his many students\nand friends all over the world.\nThose who have been associated\nwith him over the past two years\nwill also retain a deep admiration\nof his fortitude and cheerfulness\nin coping with a debilitating\nillness whose inevitable end he\nknew only too well, yet he\nretained a lively interest in his\nstudents, his research, and the\naffairs of the College until the\nvery end.\nHe is survived by his wife\nMargaret, and their two\ndaughters, Elizabeth, an\nImperial graduate, and Joanna, a present student at the College.\nThe Editor and staff of FELIX\njoin with the whole College in\nexpressing their sincere\ncondolences to Professor\nSawistowski's family.\nCourses\nscrapped\nThe College Board of Studies has\napproved plans that will result in\nphasing out Joint Honours\ncourses in Chemistry/Managemecience and Biochemistry/\nManagement Science. No new\nstudents will be admitted to these\ncourses from now on.\nDr Levitt, Director of\nUndergraduate Studies in\nChemistry, said that although he\nwas sorry to see the courses\ndisappear he didn't think it\nwould be very damaging.\n'Students will still be able to do\nan MSc in Management Science\nafter their third year', he said.\n'Current students can rest\nassured that they will still have\nthe option of Management\nScience in the third year'.\nJane Ryder, RCS academic\naffairs officer, said that students\nin the Chemistry/Biocemistry\ndepartments were annoyed that\nthe changes had been\nimplemented without any\nreferral to the staff/student\ncommittees.\nThe cuts are designed to\nachieve an overall reduction in\nstudent numbers, to meet agreed\ntarget figures.\nUGC visit\nThe University Grants\nCommittee ( UGC ) is to visit\nImperial College on February\n6th. The UGC is a government\nbody, chaired by Sir Peter\nSwinnerton-Dyer, which advises\nthe Department of Education\nand Science on the allocation of\nfunds to universities, and the\nmembers of the committee visit\neach university every five years.\nImperial College is funded as a separate body from the\nUniversity of London.\nWhile at the College the\ncommittee will be spending time\nwith the Rector, academic and\nwelfare staff, and 45 minutes with\nstudent representatives. This\nUnion delegation includes the\nsabbatical officers, academic\naffairs officers, and major subcommittee chairmen.\nIan Bull said that the aim of the\nmeeting was to show the\nmembers of the committee some\nof the problems of being a student in London, and that in\nparticular the College needs\nmore money for accommodation\nand sports facilities.\nAny student who feels that\nthey have suggestions for the\nmeeting should contact Ian Bull\nas soon as possible.\nFELIX Friday 11 January 1985\n\n"
