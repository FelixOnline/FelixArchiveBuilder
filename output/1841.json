His Nobel Prize medal was\non display together with letters of correspondence from\nPaul Dirac \u2013 who was Salam\u2019s PhD supervisor \u2013 and other\nnotable physicists.\nPhD students at Imperial\u2019s Theoretical Physics group\ndelivered presentations on topics including Electroweak\nBaryogenesis, Black Holes and Holograms, and Modified\nGravity.\nThe winning entries from the Salam Essay Contest\nwere also on display, with Lahore Grammar School\u2019s Zimal\nCheema taking home the top prize for his work entitled, A\nTurban\u2019s Triumph and Tragedy.

The word \u2018Muslim\u2019 has\nbeen erased from Salam\u2019s gravestone in\nPakistan.\nImperial\u2019s decision to rename the\nCentral Library to the Abdus Salam Library\nlast summer is a poignant tribute to Salam\u2019s\nprofound contributions to physics.\nHe has rightfully earned a place among\nthe many distinguished figures in the\nCollege\u2019s history. The renaming of the\nlibrary, and this week\u2019s events, ensure that\nSalam\u2019s impact on the field will continue to\nbe celebrated for years to come.\nIn the Science section this issue, we\nfeature pieces from students who have\nbeen inspired by Salam\u2019s legacy.\nNeha Yasin reflects on how Salam\u2019s\nlife fills her \u2013 a fellow Pakistani Ahmadi\nMuslim \u2013 with pride and hope for her own\ncareer in science.\nAnubha Bal celebrates Salam\u2019s work\nby exploring the electroweak theory, and\nexplaining its link to the elusive \u2018Theory\nof Everything\u2019 that physicists continue to\nsearch for.\nTurn to page 6 to read their thoughts.\nMonday\u2019s events were a fitting tribute to one\nof Imperial\u2019s greatest scientists\nFROM P. 1: IMPERIAL CELEBRATES ABDUS SALAM\nTaylor Pomfret\nScience Editor\nA letter sent by the High Commissioner for Pakistan in London in 1959, congratulating Salam on\nwinning a prize, on display as part of Monday\u2019s exhibition.

Stunning performances jostled with winc-ingly bad moments to produce an uneven but enjoyable,\nand ultimately impressive endeavour.\nOpera, I find, benefits from impressive surroundings.\nThe lacquered wood and soaring ceilings of the King\u2019s\nchapel did a lot to alleviate the ridiculousness of a man\nin breeches.\nHollywood\u2019s tentpole funding structure uses\ncrowd-pleasing mega hits to compensate for the more\ndaring and artistic works unlikely to generate returns.\nKing\u2019s Opera Society can be pleased by the fact that\nthey seem to have a cast full of tentpoles. Ella Frost\nas Dido, Beatrice Tinsley as First Woman, and Ellie\nBlewit as the Sorceress were extraordinarily good in\na way that was both shocking and immensely gratify-ing. They showed complete mastery of their roles and\nI can only hope that I will get to see more of them on\nthe stage.\nThis is not to slander the indie darlings of the rest of\nthe cast and chorus, who did not seemed cowed by the\ntoweringtalentoftheirleadingladies,andwhomanaged\nto make the most of the awkward, multi-layered stage at\nthe front of the chapel. Director Mya Kelln should give\nherself a pat on the back for having managed to fit a lot\nof people into not a large amount of space, without ever\nappearing congested, not to mention having secured a\nfantastic set of costumes.\nStrangely, by comparison, the orchestra\u2019s performance made one suspect that they were a collection\nof random passers-by who had had instruments thrust\ninto their hands. Thankfully, their duff notes and dud\npacing did not totally draw attention away from the\nmain event.\nA notable shout out to Imperial student Peter Costello\nin the role of Witch, and former Imperial student Gilbert\nJackson who both played the organ and was impressive\nin the role of Aeneas. If I ever need a man to carry a suitcase for me, I will know who to call.\nThis was a tour de force from a confident and purposeful society, which has both the ambition and the\nknow-how to pull off big productions. I wish them the\nbest in their next projects.\nDido &\nAeneas\nARTS\nLed by lions, played by\ncubs. A King\u2019s Opera\nSociety production.\nArtsWriter\nCALUM DRYSDALE\nAmessagefromthe\nwriter...\nDespite the seeming eclecticism of many\nyoung people\u2019s taste in music, it is notable that\nopera has not been able to make a similar breakthrough achieved by genres as diverse as Ethiopian jazz and ambient music. Arts Council England\nhas found that only around 4% of adults have\never been to an opera, and that number is steadily decreasing over time.\nThere are two reasons for this, I believe. Firstly, anyone trying to listen to opera music on their\nphone will miss much of what makes the experience so enjoyable. Opera is a visual medium as\nmuch as a musical one. Is it any surprise that opera music can feel silly if experienced without the\nstory told through the usually impressive staging\nandnecessarysubtitles?Thegreatariasonlymake\nsense in the context of a great love story.\nThe second reason is the stubborn notion\nthat opera is for the stuffy. This is an idea that\nis at odds with the very determined work done\nby many passionate for the art. The Royal Opera\nHouse in London for example offers a very generous youth ticket subsidy for 16-25 year olds, with\nfantastic tickets for only \u00a330 pounds. This is in\naddition to the numerous other fantastic opportunities to experience this art form, such as the\nKing\u2019s College Opera Society. I encourage you to\nmake a resolution this year to attend an opera\nand make up your own mind.\nDido & Aeneas, final scene Jasmine Newton-Rae\nDido & Aeneas, act one Jasmine Newton-Rae\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n6 | sCIENCE 2 February 2024\nW\nhen I first expressed an interest in pursuing\nphysics in high school, my parents\u2019 eyes flashed\na glint of recognition that surprised me at first.\nBut while they knew little about what it meant to actually study Physics, they certainly knew all about the\nrenowned physicist Dr Abdus Salam, as I soon found\nout.\nNot only was he the first Muslim Nobel Prize-winning\nscientist, but he was also a Pakistani Ahmadi Muslim \u2013\njust like me.\nBorn on 29th\nJanuary 1926 in what is now Pakistan,\nSalam\u2019s journey was marked by challenges \u2013 from growing up in a small town, in a home without electricity, to\nthe discrimination and threat of violence he faced in\nhis own country, as a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. In fact, to this day, the word \u2018Muslim\u2019\nremains whited out, erased from his gravestone in\nRabwah, Pakistan by local authorities.\nSalam was reliant on scholarships for his\nfurther education, including his studies at\nCambridge \u2013 in fact, a copy of his application was available to view during Monday\u2019s exhibition (see this issue\u2019s\ncover story on page 1).\nDespite everything, his relentless pursuit of curiosity,\nintellect, and excellence lead him to rise above societal\nprejudices, transcend borders and impact the global scientific community.\nSalam took great steps within his lifetime to develop a more inclusive environment in science. Notably, he established the International Centre for\nTheoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. The ICTP\nbecame a crucible for nurturing scientific talent from\ndeveloping nations, embodying Salam\u2019s belief that the\npursuit of knowledge should be a universal and accessible endeavour.\nA booklet from 1966, in which Abdus Salam outlines\nhis reasons for founding the centre, was also on display\nat Monday\u2019s exhibition,.\nBeyond the realms of academia, Salam\u2019s commitment\nto diversity and scientific diplomacy was exemplified by\nhis work with the United Nations, including chairing a\nUNESCO advisory panel in 1981.\nAbdus Salam\u2019s story resonates with me deeply, in a\nmanner I have not felt elsewhere in the physics com-munity. It triggers a whole host of feelings I find hard to\ndescribe. For one, his story fills me with awe at just how\nmuch can be achieved by one person, in one lifetime.\nIt also fills me with a sense of pride and honour for his\nachievements, as an individual and as a member of my\ncommunity. Salam acknowledged and showed off his\nreligion and culture proudly, wearing traditional garb as\nhe received the Nobel Prize, and crediting the Quran as\nthe font of his inspiration and achievements.\nIn touching recognition of this, his personal copy of\nthe Quran and a set of his regularly-used Quranic tapes\nwere displayed at Imperial\u2019s exhibition. For Salam, religion and science were interlinked and totally compati-ble.\nSalam\u2019s story gives me hope and inspiration for a successful career in science of my own, and gratitude for\nbeing able to have him as a role model.\nHowever, I also feel a sense of sorrow, as there is so\nmore to be done to fully achieve what Salam set out to\ndo. While the benefits of diversity were acknowledged\nin Monday\u2019s lecture, a more comprehensive discussion\nis needed on how this will be achieved. I still see a lack\nof people like me around and I know that many of my\npeers continue to feel out of place at Imperial.\nMay Abdus Salam\u2019s legacy continue to inspire us to\nfoster a world where diversity is embedded in every lab,\nlecture hall and aspect of living. The exchange of perspectives and collective knowledge can only enrich our\nscientific understanding of the world, and propel scientific inquiry and advancement. I am excited to see all\nthat physics has yet to offer.\nCelebrating the life of Abdus\nSalam\nSCIENCE\nScienceWriter\nNEHA YASIN\nA personal reflection\non Abdus Salam\u2019s\njourney \u2013 from\novercoming adversity\nto inspiring inclusivity.\nAbdus Salam\u2019s tape collection of Quranic verses.\nNeha Yasin for Felix\nHis story fills me with a\nsense of pride and honour\nfor his achievements,\nas an individual and a\nmember ofour community.\n\u201c\nPortrait of Abdus Salam in the Queens Tower Exhibition.\nTaylor Pomfret for Felix\n\n"

This\nmasterpiece of a shot by Mike, communicates the\nprimal feeling of paranoia through an unholy, yet\nvery real image.\nImagine this: you\u2019re sitting on the tube, as Londoners often do, and you begin to wonder where you\u2019d end\nup if you were to just\u2026 stay on the train, miss your stop,\nand then drive past the terminal. The depot, right? Surely, the train must end up somewhere? Somewhere in the\nback of your mind, doubt starts to whisper into your ear.\n\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t? What if instead, it just\u2026\u201d. The voice\nstops and the passing thought leaves as soon as it came,\nnever to show its ugly head again. You go back to reading your book, watching your video, or scrolling social\nmedia; but this time with an eerie feeling and a shiver\ndown your spine \u2013 the only remnants of what just occurred to you.\nLots of stories revolve around paranoia; not knowing\nwhat is coming up ahead. An iconic example springs to\nmind: Dylan Dog & Martin Mystere - Last stop: the night-mare! (1990), an italian comic book featuring the paranormal investigator Dylan Dog. This is a recommended\nread for fans of horror and psychological thrillers, as it\ndelves into the human psyche and behaviour, highlighting the abnormal within a beautifully narrated background of supernatural activities.\nThe fear of the unknown is not only profusely represented in visual media \u2013 think of Alien (1979) directed by\nRidley Scott or It Comes At Night (2019) directed by Trey\nEdwards Shults.\nIn real life, a fixed path is a reassuring feeling until\nyou start to ask yourself what happens beyond those\noff-beaten paths. What lies beyond our day-to-day?\nWhat\u2019s after death? What will I do after university?\nWhat to do when I get off work? The doubts can devour\nyou from the inside out, and yet you can\u2019t quite pinpoint\nthe feeling. It\u2019s not fear, and it\u2019s not regret. It might simply be the paranoia of having chosen the wrong path; a\nfeeling that can never truly be settled. Choosing a direction in life must indeed be the bane of human existence.\nI think we like to be told what and when to do things\nbecause surrendering control is an escape from the paranoia of having to choose every single day. 19th-centu-ry Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard paraphrased\nit nicely as: \u2018No matter what you choose, you\u2019ll regret\neverything\u2019 in his novel Either/Or. I find the timeless\nquote timeless groundbreaking, if you consider that he\nwas the first existentialist to inquire the meaning of life.\nFinally, we return to Mike\u2019s incredible picture. Look\ninto it and try to extrapolate anything except for the\ngeneral context \u2013 you know for a fact that the ski lift\nterminates somewhere, but from this image alone you\ncan\u2019t determine exactly where. You\u2019re on a track, and\nyet you have no clue where you\u2019re really going. Frozen\nSolitude beautifully depicts the worst of both worlds.\nThe monochromatic environment amplifies the liminal\nnature of the space \u2013 cold and solitary \u2013 as human existence often is.\nParanoia\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nIn the midst of your\nlife, fear is your only\ncompanion\nFrozen Solitude Mike Buzadji\nScan the QR code to submit for the\nnext theme \u2018Moby Dick\u2018:\n\n"

Since 2012, Brazil\u2019s\nAmazon deforestation levels\nhave seen an increase under\nthe presidencies of Jair Bolsonaro, Michel Temer, and Dilma\nRousseff, and reached a 12-year\nhigh in 2021, despite Bolsonaro\u2019s pledge to end the practice.\nThe Amazon rainforest is valuable to the entire planet, being\nhome to a diverse range of spe-cies, some of which remain undiscovered or unidentified. It is\na vital ecosystem for Brazil, and\nthe other countries that it spans,\nas it provides valuable natural\ncommodities like rubber and\ntimber as well as regulating the\nlocal climate. It also used to be\none of the Earth\u2019s largest carbon sinks, but, in recent years,\nthe rainforest has been\naltered\nfrom a sink to a source of carbon emissions from wildfires\nand exploitation of deforested\nland. The greatest drivers of the\nAmazon\u2019s deforestation are the\ndemand for beef \u2013 leading to\nland clearance for cattle pasture\n\u2013 and for timber, mainly from\nwealthy countries such as the\nUK, US, and China.\nPresident Luiz Lula da Silva,\nwho was sworn in on 1st January\n2023, is a vocal environmental-ist, and has pushed Brazil towards greater sustainability and\nnet-zero commitments through\nseveral policies rolled out in the\npast year. Lula\u2019s government is\nstrengthening monitoring of\nforest loss and regrowth, and of\nillegal forest-degrading activity,\nthrough more-robust satellite\nimaging and data collection.\nThis will be enhanced by law-en-forcement initiatives, including\nimproved on-the-ground tracing of criminal activity, identification of financial activity that\ncould be linked to\nillegal trade and logging, and implementation of the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) for\nenforcing good forest manage-ment. CAR ensures that local\npeople and communities have\nthe right to own their land and\nencourages efficient and sustainable management of this\nland.\nEconomic policies are also a\nbig part of Lula\u2019s conservation\nplans. Local forest management and conservation efforts\nwill be incentivised through\nsubsidies and direct payments.\nEcotourism will be encouraged,\nalthough it should be ensured\nthat the funds raised from it\nwill be channelled directly back\ninto local communities and sustainability initiatives. Improvements to product tracing and\ncertification systems will also\naim to ensure that the country\u2019s exports are being sourced\nfrom sustainable practices. This\nsomewhat aligns with the European Union Deforestation-Free\nRegulation (EUDR), established\nin May 2023. A primary aspect\nof the EUDR is a ban on imported products sourced from land\nthat was deforested or degraded\n\u2013 natural forests converted into\nplantations or other wooded\nland \u2013 after 31st\nDecember 2020.\nBrazil has put in a bid for its\ncity Belem to host the COP30\nclimate conference in late\n2025, which could be a landmark event both for examining\nthe trade routes that drive\ndeforestation and for strengthening policies on global forest\npreservation and management.\nThe environmental policy\nchanges that Lula has made\nsince his inauguration, and the\nseemingly related decrease in\ndeforestation, are a great example of what can be achieved by a\nchange in leadership, especially\nwhen strong governmental and\npublic support exists.\nLula speaks\nfor the trees\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\n\u001f\nhe built-environment and\nconstruction industry\nis currently one of the\ntop three greenhouse gas\n(GHG)-emitting sectors in the\nworld, accounting for nearly\n40% of global emissions.\nAround 25% of this comes from\nwhatiscalled\u2018embodiedcarbon\u2019\n\u2013 emissions generated by the extraction and processing of raw\nmaterials for manufacturing or\nconstruction. It is most often\ndiscussed in the context of\nbuilding development when estimating the carbon footprint of\nmaterials such as steel and con-crete.\nSteel and concrete are both\ncarbon-intensive materials, and\na huge amount of them are pro-ducedforconstructionuse.Steel\nand cement production each account for around 8% of global\nGHG emissions. Mass timber\nhas recently gained popularity in large-scale construction\nprojects as a more sustainable\nmaterial, containing\nless embodied carbon than steel\nand concrete do.\nMass timber refers to various categories of large wood\npanels that are engineered to be\nused in structural applications;\nthese consist of timber veneers\n(thin layers) that are laminated\nin such a way as to give them\nhigh load-bearing potential.\nUse of the material is becoming\nparticularly prevalent in\nScandinavian, US, and Canadian building projects.\nThe benefits of mass timber\nproducts are extensive; first\nand foremost, growing the\nsource trees mean that carbon\nis actually consumed during\ntheir production. The material\nis much lighter\nrelative to its strength than steel\nis, and tests have found it to\nhave good fire and earthquake\nresistance, as well as naturally\nbeing visually attractive.\nDespite these advantages,\nthere is an ongoing debate as\nto whether timber-based structures are in fact more sustainable than typical steel and concrete buildings. Although the\nembodied carbon from production is much lower, the timber is\nonly truly sustainable if sourced\nfrom forests that can be swiftly\nregenerated. There is a concern\nthatincreasingdemandformass\ntimber as a construction material could become a fresh driver\nof deforestation. Furthermore,\ndifficulties in fulfilling structural safety factors and fire-safety\ntesting in\nlocal building development\napproval procedures, which\nare currently more tailored\nto assessment of steel and\nconcrete materials, poses a\nsignificant barrier to the use of\nmass timber in taller buildings.\nThe Ascent in Milwaukee,\nWisconsin, standing at just\nunder 87 metres, is the tallest\nmass timber structure to date.\nAs with all innovative\nsolutions for improving\nsustainability, it will take time\nfor mass timber to gain traction\nin the fast-paced world of\nconstruction. To facilitate this,\na rapid response from urban\ndevelopment authorities will\nbe necessary to update building\ncodes and land-use policies\nso that developers can be free\nto make the switch if they so\nchoose.\nTimber tailor\nsoldier spy\n\n"

He spent\na great portion of his life creating opportunities for\nphysicists in the global South, and the questions he\nposed about the fundamental forces of nature continue\nto motivate theoretical physicists.\nToday, contemporary science is still very much in\npursuit of a \u2018Theory of Everything\u2019: an all-encompass-ing framework that unifies gravity with the other three\nfundamental forces.\nThe Standard Model postulates that there are four fundamental forces of nature: gravitational, electromagnet-ic, strong and weak.\nGravity is the weakest of the four, and the most intui-tive. It is long (infinite) range and is responsible for keeping us on the ground. It is hypothesised that this force is\npropagated by an elementary particle called a graviton,\nalthough the particle itself has yet to be observed.\nThe electromagnetic force is propagated by the photon\n(particulate light), and includes both electricity and mag-netism. In fact, these two concepts are entwined in what\nwe call an electromagnetic field.\nThe strong force holds together the quarks, the tiny\nbuilding blocks of protons and neutrons, while the weak\nforce governs the interactions of the particles in an atom.\nIt is also responsible for so-called beta decay \u2013 the mechanism by which a proton turns into a neutron. Quantum\nfield theory provides the mathematical basis to describe\nthe behaviour of these forces.\nThe unification of electromagnetism, known as the\n\u2018second great unification\u2019, was the work of Scottish\nphysicist James Clerk Maxwell, and it revolutionised\nour understanding of electricity, magnetism, and light.\nThe unification theory that Abdus Salam contributed to\nconcerned the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force at high energies.\nA vital concept in physics is symmetry. Symmetries of\na system can be described by \u2018symmetry groups\u2019, which\ncontain all of the transformations that one can apply to\na physical system while leaving all its elementary properties the same. An example of a transformation is a ro-tation.\nSalam, John Ward, and Sheldon Lee Glashow had predicted the existence of W+\n, W-, and Z bosons, which are\nforce carriers, but the requirement that these had finite\nmass posed a problem: fundamental symmetries would\nbe broken.\nIn 1968, Salam, in collaboration with Steven Weinberg, presented a resolution to this issue. They suggested merging electromagnetism and the weak force into\na unified electroweak field, characterised by four massless bosons. The symmetry of this electroweak field is\ndisrupted at low temperatures by the Higgs field, which\nimparts mass to particles upon interaction with it.\nIn its initial stages, the Universe was intensely hot\nbut gradually cooled. Salam and his collaborators\nsuggested that the breaking of electroweak symmetry took place at temperatures lower than 1015\nKelvin (1 followed by 15 zeros!), approximately one trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. Eleven years\nafter discovering their solution in 1979, Abdus Salam,\nSteven Weinberg, and Sheldon Lee Glashow were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their contribution to\nthe elegant story of the fundamental forces, a prize that\nSalam generously donated towards the establishment\nof scholarships for physicists from underrepresented-countries.\nWe celebrate Abdus Salam\u2019s contribution to physics,\nand his efforts to make physics accessible to those outside of the western world.\nAbdus Salam\u2019s Nobel work:\nElectroweak unification theory\nUnifying forces and\nunifying humanity:\nAbdus Salam\u2019s legacy\nin bridging physics and\nthe natural forces.\nScienceWriter\nANUBHA BAL\nSchematic of Unification, at high temperatures a Grand Unified\nField Theory posits the unification of all four natural forces.\nAbdus Salam Exhibition, Imperial College London\nTop: Excerpt from Salam\u2019s notebook on null geodesics.\nBottom: Salam\u2019s 1979 Nobel Prize medal.\nTaylor Pomfret for Felix\n\n"

Red meat \u2013 including venison \u2013 is a\nClass 2A carcinogen, so should not be eaten in excessive\namounts anyway.\nImperial from the vegan perspective\nDespite the benefits of going plant-based, vegans are\na minority of students on campus. Felix surveyed students who are vegan or participated in Veganuary this\nyear what they think about Imperial\u2019s catering. 16 students and one recent graduate filled in the survey.\nOverall, students felt neutral about the availability\nand positively about the taste of vegan food on campus.\nPlantworks received very positive reviews for both availability and taste. Students commended how more vegan\ncakes are being served on South Kensington and Charing Cross campuses than before, and how Silwood Park\nserves delicious fake fish and chips. The lowest rated\noutlets for vegan food were Library Cafe and Neo Pizza\nand Pasta for both taste and availability.\nLike the food being served, Imperial\u2019s Sustainable\nFoodandDrinkPolicywasmetwithmixedreviews.Most\nrespondents applauded the decisions to stop charging\nextra for non-dairy milks and to phase out beef by 2025-26. Replacing beef with venison received less praise.\nSome students used words like \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d, while another asked Taste Imperial \u201cwhat were\nthey thinking\u201d. 35% of students recognised that venison\nis the best of the meat options but said they would prefer\nplant-based food. For example, a fourth-year computing\nstudent called venison \u201ca necessary evil\u201d. Taste Imperial\nalso pledged that any livestock served would meet Red\nTractor Assured Standards and any fish would be Marine Stewardship Council certified. 70% of respondents\nwere sceptical of at least one of these certifications \u2013 for\nreasons including being \u201cdifficult to fact check\u201d, \u201chorrible conditions\u201d at certified farms, and the criteria not\nbeing robust enough.\nIn response, Jane Neary, Director of Campus Operations, said: \u201cImperial has taken positive steps in recent\nyears to improve the availability of vegan food on our\ncampuses, as shown through the successful launch of\nPlantworks, the increase in plant-based alternatives\nacross our campuses, and our commitment to make all\nnon-diary milks available at no extra charge.\n\u201cAs a large institution, we need to cater for those who\nwish to continue eating meat. Whilst there are certain\n\u2018red lines\u2019 for us - not least the continued serving of beef\n- there are other areas where we instead will prioritise\nan alternative that is more sustainable. The serving of\nvenison, for example, is a pragmatic choice given its\nconsiderably reduced carbon footprint.\u201d\nStudent Union Environment & Sustainability Forum gives vegans a voice\nOn 25th January, Deputy President (Finance and Services) Stephanie Yeung hosted representatives from PlantBased Universities (PBU) Imperial for a vegan-themed\nEnvironment & Sustainability Forum. Representatives\nexplained that PBU is a student-led initiative aiming\nfor universities across the UK and Europe to have 100%\nplant-based catering. They thought it was \u201chypocritical\u201d\nfor universities to research the health and environmental benefits of plant-based food while serving meat on\ncampus. Founded in 2021, the campaign has successfully convinced eight student unions in the UK to transition to 100% plant-based catering. 42 Imperial academics have signed a PBU open letter along with other\nacademics, politicians, campaigners, and public figures.\nThe Environment & Sustainability Forum discussed\nfour challenges PBU Imperial faces when convincing\nstudents that there should only be vegan catering on\ncampus. The first challenge is showing that vegan food\ntastes as good as food containing meat and dairy. To\ntackle this, the survey also asked respondents for the\nbest dish they made during Veganuary. Responses included tofu stir fries, Indian curries, and soups. 10 of the\n12 dish suggestions did not mention plant-based meat or\ncheese alternatives. The second challenge PBU faces is\neliminating the bias that meat-eaters have against food\nlabelled as \u2018vegan\u2019, which could be solved by removing\nthe label from vegan food or making vegan food the de-fault. Thirdly, meat-eaters are concerned that they will\nnot get enough protein from a vegan diet. To dispel this\nmyth, students at the forum shared examples of bodybuilders and elite athletes who are vegan. The trickiest\nchallenge PBU Imperial faces is convincing international students from countries where meat, fish, and dairy\nare an integral part of their culture that they do not need\nto buy them on campus. Imperial is proud of its reputation for both sustainability and internationalism, so\nPBU Imperial hopes to talk to a diverse range of students\nabout how a vegan menu could honour their cultures.\nSome students used words\nlike \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d\n,\nwhile another asked Taste\nImperial \u201cwhat were they\nthinking\u201d\n.\n\u201c\nBeef and dairy form the two\nlargest components of the\ncarbon emissions from an\naverage British person\u2019s diet.\n\u201c\nA Veganuary-themed Environment & Sustainability Forum was held last week. Guess how much of the catering was vegan! Simran Patel\nPosters appearing to express discontent for the move from beef to\nvenison have been spotted on Sherfield Walkway. Simran Patel\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n8 | environment 2 February 2024\nA\ns part of Imperial\u2019s Sustainable\nFood and Drink Policy, beef will\nsoon be replaced by wild culled venison starting at Queens Tower Rooms and\nSCR Restaurant. According to Imperial\u2019s\nSustainable Food and Drink Policy, the\namount of beef served at College catering outlets has already reduced by 47%\nsince 2017. Taste Imperial plan to reduce\nit further by 35% every year until no beef\nis served in 2025-26. Moving to venison\nforms part of this plan, but vegans at\nImperial wonder why Imperial is not replacing beef with more plant-based food.\nIronically, the switch from beef to venison was announced during Veganuary.\nBeef and dairy are the two largest\nsources of carbon emissions in an average British person\u2019s diet.. Cattle farming\nemits around 65 kilograms of carbon\ndioxide equivalent (tCO2e) for every\nkilogram of beef. Venison or deer meat,\nis a lean meat hailed as a sustainable alternative to beef. Not only does venison\nemit 38% less carbon dioxide equivalent\nthan beef, but killing a wild deer prevents its future emissions.However, the\nUK slaughters more cows each year than\nour whole deer population \u2013 so replacing\nbeef with venison is not feasible nation-wide.\nVenison is also more sustainable than\nbeef because deer are culled to control\ntheir population. There are at least 1.5\nmillion deer in the UK \u2013 a 1000 year\nhigh \u2013 partly because climate change has\nmade winters warm enough for more\ndeer to survive. Since humans drove the\nnatural predators of deer extinct, humans must now act as their predators to\nmaintain ecosystem balance. Reforestation Scotland cites deer overpopulation\nand overgrazing as the biggest threat\nto their reforestation efforts. In theory,\nTaste Imperial is moving from serving\nanimals killed especially to feed people\nto serving animals that are killed anyway\nto preserve ecosystems.\nNotably, Taste Imperial will still be\nserving animals.\nVegan Imperial students argue that\nsince plant-based food is healthier, better\nfor the planet, and more ethical than any\nkind of meat, Imperial should be replacing beef with vegan proteins like tofu and\nlentils.\nIs vegan food better for the\nplanet?\nAccording to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, food accounts for 21-37% of global emissions.\nThe same report was the first to analyse\ndemand-side reductions, concluding\nthat changes we make to our diets can\nhave a bigger impact than any other end\nuse sector. In fact, a 2020 study by Michael Clark and colleagues showed that\nhumanity will spend our carbon budgets for 1.5\u00b0C and over two-thirds of our\n2.0\u00b0 C budget on food alone with our current diets.\nRaising animals emits much more\nthan their transport, retail, or packaging.\nBeef emits about 20 times more carbon\nthan tofu and about 150 times more than\nroot vegetables according to a 2018 study.\nA 2020 study by Kim and colleagues\nfound that going vegan in the UK, where\nthe average person emits about 2 tCO2e\nper year, can reduce someone\u2019s emissions\nfrom food by 80%. The UK sits at 13th in\nthe world for per capita food emissions,\ngiving us a real reason to change quickly.\nBeing a well-respected institution, Imperial and its students could lead the country in changing diets.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organisation reported that 77% of agricultural\nland globally is used to raise or feed live-stock, even though it produces only 18%\nof global calories and 37% of global protein supply. This makes reducing meat\nand dairy consumption one of the most\nfeasible and impactful ways of addressing deforestation, feeding a growing\npopulation, and improving biodiversity.\nAccording to both the American and\nBritish Dietetic Associations, vegan diets support healthy living at every age\n\u2018Deer\u2019 Imperial,\nWhy not go\nvegan?\nENVIRONMENT\nFelix investigates what vegan\nImperial students think about food\navailability and sustainability on\ncampus.\nEnvironmentEditor\nSIMRAN PATEL\nEnvironmentWriter\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nVeganuary may be over, but these dishes recommended by vegan Imperial students will never go out\nof fashion.

She, posed as a prize possession\nto many wealthy older men, unexpectedly falls in love\nwith young Grieux. Initially perceived as mere physical\nattraction, their connection is strained by a confrontation with Manon\u2019s protective brother. Act 2 begins with\nan intense game of cards at a party, during which it is\nrevealed that Grieux is double-dealing G.M., and he is\nforced to escape. Manon follows, and the first character\n\u2013 whom I shall not reveal \u2013 is killed in a swift motion.\nManon and Grieux escape to another country in Act 3,\nposing as a married couple and hiding from the police.\nManon is taken as a personal prisoner by the gaoler,\nwho attempts to convince her to live with him. Another\nmurder triggers Manon and Grieux to flee a second time\ninto the swamps. The story ends tragically, with the two\nlovers in embrace.\nThe beauty of this ballet lies deep within its meticulous choice of costume, choreography, and setting.\nWithout dialogue, the audience has to guess and feel\nthe storyline. The beginning of Act 1 was cryptic, as one\ntries to find Manon in her white costume in the flock of\nbrown-black dresses, instantly shining the spotlight on\nour female lead. Bold stripes of red and purple helped\ndistinguish Monsieur G.M. from the other wealthy men,\nall dressed in black, and Grieux, dressed in beige.\nThe choreography becomes the silent narrator, unveiling the complex relationships between characters\nas we see them embrace. Manon dances effortlessly\nwith Grieux, while her intimate scene with Monsieur\nG.M. requires the aid of his assistant, representing his\ninability to satisfy her by himself. Manon embraces her\nbrother as her only family, always in his proximity for\nprotection. It does not take too much interpretation to\nunderstand the storyline by observing body lanuage.\nThe backdrops changed twice per act. With a total of six\nscenes,theaudiencetravelsfromthecourtyard,toManon\u2019s\nbedroom, to an upper-class party, to the port, the gaolers\noffice, and finally in the swamps. Without excessively relying on props, the cast skillfully occupied the stage, placing\nthe spotlight on the interactions between characters. The\ndecision to maintain a classical setting, rather than modernising the ballet, enhanced its timeless appeal.\nThe night ended after three excellent hours of mu-sic, dance, and raw emotion. The Royal Opera House\nis truly a magnificent place, with great seating in the\nupper amphitheatre, and a vibrant atmosphere during\nintervals provided by their snacks and drinks. Guests\nare allowed to pre-order drinks to avoid long queues\nduring intervals, adding to the overall enjoyment of\nthe evening.\nManon\nA review of the ROH\u2019s\nperformance.\nArtsWriter\nCHARLOTTE E.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n12 | arts 2 February 2024\nS\nhakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet is a play that needs\nneither introduction nor explanations: so en-grained it is in the public consciousness, that often we recite its lines, and hold it as a the exemplar\ndepiction of defying tradition and honour for the pursuit of love. DramSoc\u2019s production certainly delivered\nboth quality acting and staging, as well as bringing\nmarvellous innovations to the centuries-old play.\nWhile I was hesitant about the setting being 1960s\nBrighton during the clash of mods and rockers \u2013 after\nall, it is in \u2018fair Verona that we lay our scene\u2019 \u2013 my hesitations were laid to rest as the setting did not detract\nfrom the play itself. Instead, it added a bold new colour\npalette, especially where staging and costuming were\nconcerned, and so hearty praise must be given to Director Jonah McCleod along with the production crew for\ntheir brilliant stylistic choices.\nPlaying the role of Romeo was Jack Finnis, whose\nimpeccable delivery, attention to metre and emphasis,\nemotional detail, and sheer reverence for the play was\na shining beacon and paragon of tasteful acting which\ndeserves much acclaim. Charlotte Andrews was equally\nbrilliant in her role as his infatuated, star-crossed lover,\nand was a magnetic personality on stage, captivating not\njust her on-stage partner but the audience as well. However, much applause should be given to Molly Clifford\nin the role of the Nurse. While I personally believe that\nthe \u2018low-class, no-filter maid with the thick Northern accent\u2019 is a trope done to death, Molly Clifford is nonetheless a fine actress who brought radiance, humour, and\ndominance to the stage.\nElana Todd-Miller and Omar Tahir were in the roles\nof Benvolio and Mercutio respectively, and were fine ac-tors, bringing much lyricism to their lines which highlighted the poetic nature of the play. However, at times\nit felt like the characters had swapped roles, leaving\nthe audience in a state of confusion: rather than being\na kind-hearted and pacifist soul, Benvolio at times was\nsnarky, forlorn, and sarcastic; instead of being spritely\nand (as the character\u2019s name implies) mercurial, Mercutio was soft and gentle.\nBilly Gregory in the role of Tybalt brought the necessary components to make the headstrong and trig-ger-happy boy an interesting character to observe on\nstage, but he was on the brink of turning the character\ninto a comical spectacle: the unnecessary raspy voice\nand peculiar finger-waving were bordering on the car-toonish. Finally, Siddharta Adaikalaraj in the role of Friar Lawrence gave us a wonderful display of acting pro-fessionalism. The frankly appalling behaviour from the\naudience during the entirety of the play did not waver\nhis commendable acting, and he maintained the utmost\nstoic demeanour.\nFinal mentions must be made also to the choreogra-phers, who put together an exceptional spectacle during the Capulet banquet scene. Packed with of-the-era\ndancing, it goes to show that such feats of ingenuity\nare what allow the audience to be fully immersed in a\nplay\u2019s setting. Truly this was a wonderful and refreshing performance from DramSoc, the sheer amount of\ntalent on display was breathtaking. The production\nand staging teams may rest easy knowing that all their\nhard work has paid off and yielded a fabulous produc-tion.\nRomeo & Juliet\nArtsEditor\u0003\nGILBERT JACKSON\nA review of Imperial DramSoc\u2019s production.\nRomeo and Juliet wedding scene Gavin Xie\nFinal scene Gavin Xie\n\n"
