If you\ncompare it to using a keyboard and\nmouse (yes, I am a PC gamer) you\nwill find it\u2019s a lot easier to execute\nyour commands on time that make\ngetting that head-shot a lot simpler.\nHow to test my claim?

Because\nbeing a console gamer in a Call of\nDuty Lobby with PC gamers is like\nfinding yourself in a lobby full of\nnoobs \u2013 as in, it\u2019s not exactly fair.\nI actually considered re-evaluating\nmy decision on the cost effectiveness\nof consoles compared to gaming\nPCs. This is because now, you have\nto pay for online/multiplayer gaming\non both the Xbox One and PS4\nwhich 99% of gamers will get either\none, the other or both. When it was\nOsama Awara\nGames Writer\n5 Things Consoles are killing\nWith the recent releases of the\nXbox One and PlayStation 4, it\u2019s\nhigh time we examine the victims\nconsoles have claimed since their\nheralding in the 70\u2019s. Will they be the\nultimate culprit in our murder series?\nThe great thing about consoles is\ntheir price relative to gaming PC rigs.\nWith the Xbox One currently at \u00a3430\nand the PS4 standing at \u00a380 less, it\u2019s\nno wonder so many gamers flock\nto consoles instead. With the same\namount of \u2018console money\u2019 you\u2019d only\nmanage to buy a \u2018student\u2019 PC and by\nthat I mean a computer that handles\nMicrosoft office and RuneScape if you\nfancy a bit of that. For you to handle\na hardcore game such as Battlefield\n4 or Crysis 3 at decent frame-rates\nand maxed out settings, you\u2019re\nlooking at easily over \u00a31000. With the\ncurrent state of tuition fees, I don\u2019t\nthink any university gamer has that\namount of free cash lying around.\nBefore buying a next generation\nconsole, whether it is a PlayStation,\nXbox or Nintendo, one of the main\ngamer concerns is whether they can\nplay their old games collected over\nthe past decade on the new systems.\nIt is never more dismaying to find the\nmany game titles on your bookshelf\nthat you still haven\u2019t touched or\ncompleted unplayable on your new\nsystem that you\u2019ve invested in. By\nthat, ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m\nreferring to the Xbox One,which\ndoes not let you play 360 games,\nwhich is such a shame considering\nmany big titles being released\nrecently on the 360 such as Battlefield\n4. PlayStation 4 certainly isn\u2019t off the\nhook either, but at least they\u2019ve tried\nto remedy their \u2018hardware mishap\u2019\nby allowing previous console titles\navailable via online streaming.\nSince the release of the PlayStation\n2 in 2001, consoles have had their\nown inbuilt DVD, and now, Blue\nRay players. The only place you\nwould find a DVD player is e-bay,\nand even Blue Rays are starting to\nfeel the market shift.

It\u2019s\nvery strange because they\u2019re so close\nand yet they don\u2019t really talk at all.\n[RCA is located behind Beit Quad, next\nto the Royal Albert Hall.]\nWhat inspired you to set it up?\nI think it was the fact that I\u2019ve always\nenjoyed art, and it was a bit of a wrench\nfor me to come to Imperial. I spent\nmost of my first year hoping I\u2019d fail\nso I\u2019d have an excuse to go and do an\nArt Foundation course! I also saw that\nthere were a lot of students at Imperial\nwho liked art but kind of felt like they\nhad to supress it, because they couldn\u2019t\nreally use it or because it wasn\u2019t that\nrelevant to their studies.\nDo you have an artistic background\nyourself?\nWell, I always did art qualifications\noutside of school. I did an Art GCSE\nand a Graphic Design A Level at a\nfurther education college \u2013 although I\ngot a U in Graphic Design\u2026!\nWhy do you think it\u2019s important\nto have something like Artifact at\nImperial?\nI think mostly because there\u2019s a\ndemand for it. I basically see myself as a\nfacilitator.IknowthattheRCAstudents\nare gagging to have interaction with\nscientists, and I know that for a lot of\nthe PhD students, and undergraduates,\nthey really want to be able to talk about\ntheir science, and they want to see it\nrepresented in interesting ways.\nI actually don\u2019t like a lot of \u2018Art\nScience\u2019\n, a lot of it\u2019s terrible. But I want\nto give people the opportunity. You\nfind that some quite fantastic things\nemerge sometimes when you just give\npeople the opportunity.\nDo you think it\u2019s been a success so\nfar?\nThe first year we ran it, I think it went\nquite well, given that it was a standing\nstart; we had an exhibition of about\nseven pieces, and some of those\npieces were beautiful. The last couple\nof years it\u2019s been a bit up and down I\nthink, so I\u2019m using this year to take\nup the scheme again and really push\nit forward, and hopefully leave a big\nlegacy before I finally leave Imperial!\nHave you thought about including\nthe Royal College of Music (RCM) as\nwell?\nWe have! It doesn\u2019t fit very well into\nthe format, but it would be nice to\nhave a really solid year and then to\nstart expanding the scheme. We had\nthe Courtauld Institute involved last\nyear, who are a small art history place\nat Somerset House. But it would be\nreally nice to extend this to the RCM,\nyes. I\u2019m not sure how we would fit any\nemerging collaborations into a gallery\nthough \u2013 I guess we\u2019d have to have a\nthink!\nHow can Imperial students get\ninvolved in this year\u2019s Artifact?\nThe launch event is Wednesday the\n4th December, and it\u2019s going to be\na pub quiz based on art and science\nquestions. We\u2019re going to force you\ntogether into teams with artists and\nscientists and hopefully it will be quite\nfun. You\u2019ll have a chance to talk to\nartists and start to maybe suggest ideas.\nWe\u2019ll then have a series of events\nthroughout the start of next term, and\nyou can come along to any of them, and\ntry and find someone who\u2019s perfect for\nyou to collaborate with!\nDo you have to have a background in\nart to get involved?\nIt\u2019s definitely, definitely not essential.\nAlmost, almost, possibly, you could say\nthat it would help if you didn\u2019t.\nWhat kinds of artworks have been\nproducedinpreviouscollaborations?\nI think my all-time favourite was an\nartwork called Matters of the Heart. It\nwas a book-binder, who collaborated\nwith a biomedical scientist. They took\nevery slice from an MRI scan of the\nheart and bound them into a book, so\nwhen you opened the book you would\nsee cross-sections through the heart,\nand when you closed it the whole heart\nwould be there in ink. It was really,\nreally gorgeous.\nWould each piece normally be\nmade by one scientist and one RCA\nstudent, or groups?\nI think we\u2019re going to leave it open for\npeople to form any kind of group they\nwant. Generally pairs normally work\nquite well, and it\u2019s easy for people to\nform pairs, but if people want to form\ngroups that\u2019s fine as well.\nFinally, what advice would you give\nto Imperial students looking to get\nmore involved in art across campus?\nThere are lots of outlets, I think, for\nartistic students. Obviously, Leonardo\nFine Arts Society. There are quite a\nfew artists in residence who are worth\ntalking to, such as Geraldine Cox in\nthe Physics Department and Gemma\nAnderson in Maths. And Artifact, of\ncourse!\nArtifact\u2019s first event will be this\nWednesday, 4th December at 7.30pm,\nand will take the form of a science and\narts pub quiz in the Royal College of\nArt\u2019s college bar. Everyone welcome.\n\u201cFashion is a vampiric thing, it\u2019s the\nhoover on your brain. That\u2019s why\nI wear the hats, to keep everyone\naway from me. They say, \u201cOh, can I\nkiss you?\u201d I say, \u201cNo, thank you very\nmuch. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve worn the hat.\nGoodbye.\n\u201d I don\u2019t want to be kissed by\nall and sundry. I want to be kissed by\nthe people I love.\n\u201d \u2013 Isabella Blow\nA\nbrand new exhibition\nopened at Somerset\nhouse last week,\ndocumenting the life of\nthe late Isabella Blow; a\nladyhighlyregardedwithinthefashion\nindustry. Born into the privileged\nworld of British aristocracy, Blow\nis acknowledged with discovering\nthe likes of Alexander McQueen\nand Philip Treacy, along with being\nreputed for her own eccentric and\noutlandish style. Having grown up\nin London, Isabella studied in New\nYork and later landed a job as an\nassistant to the revered editor-in-chief\nof American Vogue, Anna Wintour.\nSubsequently working for the Sunday\nTimes style magazine, she progressed\nwithin Tatler until ultimately earning\nthe role of fashion director.\nIsabella Blow: Fashion Galore!\nfeatures pieces from her extensive\npersonal clothing collection, with\nitems from McQueen and Treacy\nalong with the likes of Dior, Prada,\nFendi, Givenchy, Manolo Blahnik\nand Marni. This is not solely an\nexposition of fashion, however, but\nalso a commemoration of the life of a\ncomplex and colourful lady. Through\nthe use of video, voice recordings,\nletters and books, visitors are given\nthe opportunity to delve deeply\ninto Blow\u2019s personal life as well as\nwitnessing creations typically seen\ngracing the covers of high-fashion\nmagazines.\nBlow had a meticulous eye for\ntalent and, after witnessing the young\nAlexander McQueen\u2019s Central Saint\nMartins MA fashion show, was swift\nin purchasing the entire collection.\nThe pair developed a close personal\nand professional relationship in which\nshe helped him develop into the\ninternationally acclaimed designer he\nwas to become.\nThe world which she helped\nrevolutionise, however, would\neventually lead to her downfall.\nDaphne Guinness, a close companion\nof Blow\u2019s, stated that, \u201c[Blow] was\nupset that McQueen didn\u2019t take her\nalong when he sold his brand to Gucci.\nOnce the deals started happening, she\nfell by the wayside. Everybody else got\ncontracts, and she got a free dress\u201d.\nIn addition to her professional\nproblems, her marriage of 18 years\nbroke down and she was later\ndiagnosed with ovarian cancer. She\nbecame severely depressed and\nattempted suicide many times, once\nbreaking both her ankles by throwing\nherself from the Hammersmith\nFlyover. On May 6th 2007, during a\nweekendsocietyparty,Blowexclaimed\nthat she was going shopping. She\nwas discovered by her sister on the\nbathroom floor after swallowing the\nweed-killer Paraquat and exclaimed,\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that I haven\u2019t taken\nenough\u201d. She died at hospital the\nfollowing day.\nAdmittedly not for everyone,\nthis exhibition is certainly of great\nimportance in recognising a lady\nresponsible for making such a\nprofound contribution to her field.\nHer life, albeit ending prematurely,\nwas nevertheless full of experiences\nand encounters that make this\nexhibition so much more than a\nsuperficial array of fashion, but instead\na fascinating and original experience\nthat demonstrates the talent and flair\nof an extraordinary lady.\nMario Lepore\nWriter\nWhat: Isabella Blow: Fashion Galore!\nWhere: Somerset House, WC2\nWhen: 20th Nov 2013 - 2nd Mar 2014\nPrice: \u00a312.50, \u00a310 concessions, \u00a36.25\non Mondays\nFashion Galore!\nARTIFACT EXHIBITION 2013\nJO NUTTALL\nPETER MCDIARMID\n\u201cNot just an exposition of fashion, this Somerset House exhibition is also\na commemoration of the life of a complex and colourful lady.\u201d\nA true modern masterpiece\nS\natyagraha has been lauded\nas a masterpiece of modern\nopera since its premiere in\n1980. After witnessing it\nfor myself, I can\u2019t help but\nagree.\nThis is not a conventional opera\nin any way, but an exciting chance\nto see what one of the greatest\nof contemporary composers has\ncontributed to the evolving art form.\nAs such, it\u2019s important to approach\nwith an open mind; the rewards are\ngreat.\nSatyagraha, roughly meaning\n\u2018force-truth\u2019, is the word used to\ndescribe Ghandi\u2019s philosophy of nonviolent resistance, a concept which is\nvery relevant today. Here there is no\nnarrative or plot in the conventional\nsense; instead we are witness to a\nseries of scenes which unfold and\nexplore aspects of Satyagraha, and\nGhandi\u2019s personal journey.\nThe opera is sung entirely in\nSanskrit, and no subtitles are\nprovided \u2013 except for the occasional\nphrase projected on a wall \u2013 but this\ndoesn\u2019t detract, and instead adds\na level of mysticism. Indeed, the\nwhole performance has a mysticism\nto it. Philip Glass\u2019 minimalist score\nis entrancing, and the beautiful\nimagery presented by Phelim\nMcDermott\u2019s \u201cskills ensemble\u201d is\nequally captivating.\nAs the sung text consists of\nrepeated phrases from the Bhagavad\nGita, there is little action; the actors\nare often stood still for long periods\nand use small but effective gestures to\ncommunicate. Still, a grand sense of\nmovement, or perhaps of unfolding,\nis felt through the happenings on\nstage; giant creatures are constructed\nfrom bits of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, a bird is\nborn from sticky tape and a cloudy\nsky is magnificently turned clear\nblue. Almost every image presented\nis strikingly beautiful.\nPhillip Glass, icon of the minimalist\nmovement, has contributed a\nmagnificent score, its repetition\nperfectly suited to the meditative\nnature of the work. Yet on a larger\nscale it is structured to provide a\nEmiel De Lange\nWriter\nWhat: Satyagraha, with the English\nNational Opera\nWhere: London Coliseum, WC2\nWhen: Until 8th Dec 2013\nPrice: various\nDONALD\nCOOPER\ngreat sense of happening, and an\nauthentic narrative emerges despite\nthe near-endless repetition. In this\nsense the ending is particularly\nstriking, as a sense of resolution is\nremarkably achieved. This is happens\nthrough a broadening of the tempo\nand fantastic use of colours in the\norchestra. Meanwhile at other points\ndynamism and momentum are\ncreated through syncopated rhythms\nand odd compound timings.\nThe orchestra, under Stuart\nStratford, handles all this with great\ndiscipline, stamina and occasionally\nflair, as does the choir, whose endless\nstaccato repetitions are impressively\ncarried. A great deal of work has\nobviously gone into balancing the\norchestra with the singers on stage,\nas they are almost always perfectly\naudible and their words clear.\nOutstanding among these is Alan\nOke in the role of Ghandi, who sings\nwith a tenderness befitting the great\nman. The rest of the cast is superb,\nalthough Clare Eggington\u2019s secretary\nwas at times off-pitch in a very\npenetrating role.\nThere is little left to say. This\nbeautifully meditative journey\nthroughoneofthemostextraordinary\nof humanity\u2019s episodes needs to be\nseen by everyone.\nWhat: Woyzeck\nWhere: Omnibus Clapham, SW4\nWhen: 19th Nov to 7th Dec 2013\nPrice: \u00a315, concessions \u00a312\nT\nhrough an ominous mist and\na haunting cello note, I enter\nthe theatre. Two figures sit\nthere, hacking away at timber,\nas I cross the woodchip floor\nto my seat. This is just how Georg\nB\u00fcchner\u2019s seminal work Woyzeck\nshould be performed: intimate,\ninclusive, atmospheric. Clapham\u2019s\nnewly opened Omnibus Theatre\nprovides an excellent setting for this\nplay. In its first in-house production,\nthe converted Victorian library creates\na truly unique performance space, cut\nin two by a colonnade that encourages\nexciting and innovative stage design.\nOne hundred years after its first\nperformance, Woyzeck tells the story\nof a poor man \u2013 a barber, soldier and\noccasional scientific test subject, who\nis constantly belittled and ridiculed\nby his superiors. When his wife finally\ncheats on him with a handsome Drum\nMajor, his eroding mental condition\ncompels him to murder her in a fit\nof rage. The plot was in fact inspired\nby an actual murder that took place\nin Leipzig, executed by a wigmaker\ncalled Woyzeck who said he heard\nvoices that urged him to do it.\nThroughout the play, Woyzeck is\ndehumanised and criticised, whether\nit be for pissing on a wall like an animal\nor by being forced to eat nothing\nbut peas for six months as part of an\nexperiment. Even the midday sun\noppresses him as he works to scrape\ntogether a living for his wife and child.\nHis whole life is torment, submission,\nmisery, like the monkey puppet forced\nto perform by the dominant showman.\nAnd so it seems simple enough a\nplay, a classic tale of poverty, lust and\na murder of passion. However, it is\nanything but that, as it becomes clear\nthrough the phenomenal scriptwriting\nof B\u00fcchner. Free will, determinism and\nexploitation of the underclasses are all\naddressed through the tragedy that\nWoyzeck becomes. It is the powerfully\nrelevant nature of such themes that\nmakes this play so timeless and\nespecially poignant in today\u2019s world of\neconomic injustice.\nBecause of this, people often\ndescribe Woyzeck as the first truly\nmodern drama. Modernity is also seen\nin its assembly. Fragmented, it is a play\nformed from a mosaic of cut scenes\nthat creates a plotline as disjointed as\nWoyzeck\u2019s paranoid mind.\nFor me, it is the play\u2019s writing,\nthemes and structure that make it so\nbrilliant, not especially its setting in a\nsmall German town. I feel this detracts\nfrom the work\u2019s underlying messages\nand so I think an update is needed to\nmake it more relevant to the audience.\nHence, I thought it a shame that the\noriginal setting was hardly changed by\nthe director. I went away thinking what\nan exceptionally clever play B\u00fcchner\nhad written, as opposed to considering\nits interpretation and performance.\nSuch was the influence of B\u00fcchner\u2019s\nplay that many adaptations of it were\nmade, most notably Alban Berg\u2019s opera\nWozzeck, which appeared at the Royal\nOpera House a few weeks ago. I found\ncomparing the two very interesting,\nas it showed precisely the effect of\nmusic on the drama itself. Berg\u2019s\nmodernist masterpiece of atonality,\nI feel, perfectly complimented and\neven accentuated the madness and\nhopelessness of the main protagonist\u2019s\nstruggles. But which was better, the\nplay or the opera? Even though the\nformer was excellent, both intense\nand poignant, I feel the opera was\nable to intensify this experience,\nsensationalising the script to create a\npiece of art that still lingers with me\nafter all this time.\nWoyzeckisstillwellworthseeing.The\nbeautiful setting and some excellent\nacting performances, especially from\nLiam Smith, the helpless yet frenzied\nWoyzeck, really make for a brilliant\nshow. But I think what is most clear\nfrom the play is the sheer genius of\nB\u00fcchner. At only 23, he was able to\ncreate a work that combines drama\nand emotion with deep philosophical\nquestioning and poignant social\ncriticism. To create a character in\nWoyzeck that can be empathised\nwith, despite having murdered his\nwife in a state of virtual insanity, is\na phenomenal feat definitely worth\nexperiencing.\n\n"

This will strengthen\nhigher education, industry and society\nalike.\n\u201cIn recent years, Imperial\u2019s CDTs\nhave pioneered a series of innovations\nin doctoral training, including the\ndevelopment of bespoke professional\nskills training, public engagement,\nentrepreneurship and cohort-building. This approach has cultivated\nthe right environment for students\nto combine world-class training in\nresearch with the acquisition of a\nbroad range of work-ready skills. Our\nnew CDTs will enable us to take this\nsuccessful approach to the next level.\u201d\nThe Chair of the EPSRC, Paul\nGolby said that: \u201cCentres for Doctoral\nTraining have already proved to be a\ngreat success and the model is popular\nwith students, business and industry.\nThese new centres will give the\ncountry the highly trained scientists\nand engineers it needs and they will\nbe equipped with skills to move on in\ntheir careers.\u201d\nCampus Services:\nSilence Abounds\nNida Mahmud\nWriter\nImperial to create new Centres for\nDoctoral Training for postgraduates\nO\nne week further into\nthe confusion over\ncleaning in halls and\nCampus Services has\nyet to reply to the\nquestions sent to them by Felix over\ntwo weeks ago, begging the question:\nDoes the department feel any\nobligationtoprovidingitsstakeholders\nwith satisfactory information? We\nnow approach the end of the first term\nof the academic year, and for some\nstudents there is still confusion over\ntheir cleaning rotas, and some would\nstill like to see some token of apology\nfrom the department in regards to the\npoor communication that has gotten\nso out of hand.\nOne major cause for concern is\nthe fact that despite the duration\nthat the changes have been in effect,\nsome students still have no idea about\nwhether they have access to cleaning\nequipment, and if they do have access,\nsome still may not be aware to find it.\nHere at Felix we find it upsetting that\nmany new students will have waited\na full four weeks before their rooms\nhave been cleaned, without the option\nto clean it themselves.\nFelix believes that at a minimum the\nCampus Services department should\nprovide much more information about\nthe feedback process they consulted\nbefore making the changes, as well as\nthe decisions and reasoning that led to\nthe final choice.\nHopefully, at the upcoming cleaning\nservices review (that Campus Services\npromised in their most recent missive)\nwe will see a situation where the people\nwho are affected most by the changes\nget to have some input into the\ncleaning solution, whether they would\nlike things to return to the way they\nare, or whether they have suggestions\nthat would drastically improve both\ntheir happiness and wellbeing.\nLooking forward to the future, Felix\nhopes that all College departments\nwill learn from this mistake and\nwill consult or at least inform\nstakeholders of important changes to\nthe services it provides, rather than\njust implementing changes, which are\nannounced at a later date.\nFelix\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nUnion releases\n12/13AnnualReport\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhis Tuesday the Union\nreleased their most recent\nannual report, covering last\nyear\u2019s activities. There have\nbeen some changes in the\nUnion\u2019s financial reporting methods,\nafter the recent change to full charity\nstatus it now has to present financial\nstatements according to the Charities\nSORP (Statement of Recommended\nPractice). The SORP requires a charity\nto not only present its finances, but\nalso to do it in such a way that shows\nhow financial transactions relate to\ntheir charitable activities.\nThe Union\u2019s charitable activities\nfall into three categories, Social\nEnterprise, Student Activities &\nDevelopment, and Student Voice.\nSocial Enterprise incorporates the\nactivities of the Union\u2019s \u201clicenced\ntrade, retail outlets and the hiring of\nspace\u201d, which includes the bars run by\nthe Union (on the South Kensington\nCampus) and the Union Shop and Gift\nShop on campus.\nStudent Activities & Development,\nhowever, encapsulates all the activities\nrelating to student volunteering\nand Clubs, Societies and Projects\n(CSPs). Meanwhile, the Student Voice\ncategory accounts for campaigning,\nrepresenting student views and\nvarious other student-related\ndemocratic activities.\nAs a part of the changes to the\naccounting practices used to present\nthe Union\u2019s accounts (after gaining\ncharity status), they now have to\nreport the value of goods and services\nprovided for Union use free of charge.\nThis includes the provision of building\nspace and IT services by College.\nOver the 2012-13 period, the\nUnion (via CSPs) paid over \u00a340,000\nin affiliation fees to external bodies,\nincluding \u00a320,096.82 to \u2018British\nUniversities & Colleges Sport\u2019 (BUCS)\nand \u00a35111.28 to Denham Golf Club.\nThe Union donated \u00a3145,296.37\nthrough fund-raising activities last\nyear,includingdonationsof\u00a335,235.75\nto the Winnicott Foundation,\n\u00a324,204.97 to Islamic Relief, \u00a39297.00\nto Tsunami Rehabilitation and\n\u00a35,192.76 to Children in Need.\nExamining the statement of\nFinancial Activities (for the year\nending 31 July 2013), ignoring the\n\u00a3359,804 estimated for support costs\n(which are in fact provided by College\nfor free), over the 2012-13 year the\nUnion made a \u00a3171,246 surplus from\nSocial Enterprise Activities (including\nbars, the Union Shop and hiring out\nspaces in the Union building).\nOverall, the Union seems to be in\na healthy financial position, having\nachieved a surplus of \u00a3196,112 over\nthe 2012-13 period.\nAccording to the Union\u2019s Balance\nSheet on 31 July, the Union owned\nNext week\u2019s issue is\nthe last issue of term!\nAhhh! What to do?\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll still be active\nover the Christmas holidays on\nour website and via\nsocial media!\nThere\u2019s still time\nto get involved\nthis term,\nsimply send an\nemail to one of the\nsection editors and\nthey\u2019ll be in touch!\n\u00a3190,960 worth of stock (think goods\nfor sale), was owed \u00a350,699 by debtors\nand had a total of \u00a31,525,434 between\nfunds in the Union bank account and\ncash held on the premises. While the\nUnion also owed its creditors a total\nof \u00a3514,921 at that point in time, after\ntaking into account the value of the\nUnion\u2019s investments (\u00a3110,627) and\nthe value of its tangible fixed assets\n(\u00a35,398,106 \u2013 which we assume\nincludes the value of the building\ncontaining the Union offices), the\nUnion had (at the time) net current\nassets worth \u00a36,760,904.\nIn terms of staff salaries, the Union\nseems to pay a total of \u00a31,773,812\n(including pension and National\nInsurance contributions), with\n\u00a31,045,000 going to staff in the Social\nEnterprise category (including full\nand part-time staff and students at the\nUnion\u2019s bars and shops). According to\nthe report on average 49 permanent\nstaff and 109 student staff were\nemployed over the 2012-13 period.\nThe highest paid employee at the\nUnion is paid between \u00a370-80,000.\nOverall, the Union is in a good\nfinancial position, having made a\nstrong recovery from the 09-10 period\nand now has healthy reserves which\ncan be used to improve the student\nexperience at Imperial.\nImperial college union\nDo Campus Services truly care\nabout their stakeholders?\n\n"

Travers (Emma Thompson). Mrs\nTravers to be exact. And nothing else.\nShe is very clear as to how she would\nlike to be addressed, much like how\nWalt Disney himself (Tom Hanks)\nwould have to have others call him\nWalt instead of Mr Disney, and so it\nwould seem that they have both met\ntheir deserving match in this film. And\nit turns out that this match is packed\nwith wonderful little details.\nThere is never a boring moment\nin this incredibly well acted film\ndespite its 125-minute running time.\nThe story has a defined thread that\nit follows through without getting\nsidetracked but does manage to get\nenough details to weave a sound piece\nof work. It also makes good use of\nwarm-toned flashbacks to add depth\nand layers to the emotions that lets the\nviewers understand the complicated\ncharacter that is Mrs Travers, without\noverusing the sentimentality factor.\nThompson, with 2 Oscars under her\nbelt, is absolutely spot-on in terms of\nliving and breathing her role in the\nmovie. Her overwhelming reluctance\nin agreeing to Walt\u2019s proposition\nbrought to life by her stiff upper lip\nattitude that dominates more than\nthe first half of the film is hilarious\nto say the least, which is made even\nmore enjoyable by Hanks\u2019 and other\nsupporting roles\u2019 priceless reactions\nthat utilises every pause, flinch, sigh,\nlook etc. to its fullest effect.\nThe film does not feature many\ncharacters which is because there\nis no need to do so; each character\nis meticulously placed to play their\nrespective part that gets the overall\nclock of this movie tick smoothly.\nEven Disney\u2019s receptionist has her\nmoment of glory and Mrs Travers\u2019\nchaffeur in Orlando has something\nvaluable to add to the fabric of the\nplot. Of course, seeing the woman\nherself who inspired the original\ncharacter of Mary Poppins, aunt Ellie\n(Rachel Griffiths), is such a treat that\nit really is tease that we only get to see\nher for around 4 minutes total.\nAnother very welcome treat is the\nnumber of interesting trivia that is\nrevealed to the viwer in relation to\nDisney as well as the making of Mary\nPoppins itself. Not only do you get\nto see the original character sketches\nthat were used in the process, those\nwho are already familiar with the\nDisney picture will instantly recognise\nits iconic words such as \u2018spit-spot\u2019 and\n\u2018spoonful of sugar\u2019 in addition to the\nsongs that are sung for Mrs Travers\u2019\nhigh threshold approval and no doubt\nher reaction will only make it better.\nThe concession that Mrs Travers was\nwilling to make in the famous ending\nsong \u2018Let\u2019s Go Fly a Kite\u2019, for example.\nAll in all, this film is certainly one\nof the best we will see this year with\nits ever funny, heartwarming and\nintriguing content. By all means, do\nmake sure to check out the original\nwork of Mary Poppins if you haven\u2019t\ndone so already but then that would\nmean that you\u2019ve been living in a cave.\nAnd may the odds be ever in your favour...again\nAnonymous\nReluctant Writer\nThe Hunger Games:\nCatching Fire\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\nWriters: Simon Beaufoy, Michael\nArndt, Suzanne Collins (novel)\nStarring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh\nHutcherson, Liam Hemsworth,\nWoody Harrelson\nRuntime: 146 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nSo it\u2019s been about a year since the first\nHunger Games film made its debut,\nhowever, the second one in the series\ncatches up with the protagonists\nbefore a whole year has passed for\nthem. Because just being out of the\narena does not necessarily mean\nthat you\u2019re out of the game. Rather,\nafter becoming the victors Katniss\n(Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh\nHutcherson) are unwittingly in the\nmiddle of some political agenda which\nrequires them to be madly in love.\nWhich would have been fine but for\nPeeta\u2019s sheepish passivity but more\nso due to Katniss\u2019 long standing love\ninterest Gale (Liam Hemsworth) \u2013\ndespite the severe lack of progress\non that front so far \u2013 being in the\npicture. And occupying quite a bit\nof space in the so-called picture. In\nspite of the positively life-threatening\ncircumstances that unfold, the tension\nfrom the love triangle is lingering in\nthe background which sets down the\ncringe-foreboding grounds for the\nthird one especially as it will be split\ninto two films.\nHowever, the film is more or less\nfaithful to the contents of the original\nnovel that it is based on and does not\nmake the mistake of overly dwelling\non certain details whilst cutting out\nsignificant chunks and ultimately\nmaintains appropriate balance. As\nfans of the series would already\nknow, quite a bit takes place in the\nsecond volume and the film digests it\nall well without losing the hints and\nforeshadowing and, most importantly,\nwithout dragging on and on. This is\nalso true for the introduction of new\ncharacters (Sam Claflin, Jena Malone)\nthat will carry on into the later films\nwhere only the essential parts of their\nstories are told to let them intertwine\nskillfully with existing characters. The\nchemistry between the existing and\nnew casts certainly seems convicing\nwhich is very good news for the\nremaining characters waiting to be\nintroduced.\nThe film also packs much more\nof a punch in terms of action in\ncomparison to the first film where the\ngame seemed more of a solo camping\nchallenge than a gladitorial fight to the\nSaving Mr Banks\nDirector: John Lee Hancock\nWriters: Kelly Marcel, Sue Smith\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Emma\nThompson, Ruth Wilson, Colin\nFarrell, Paul Giamatti, Bradley\nWhitford, Jason Schwartzman,\nRachel Griffiths\nRuntime: 125 minutes\nCertification: PG\nAnonymous\nReluctant Writer\nThe example above shows a script\nthat is clearly not one which will stop\ndenigration of women in films. It does\nhowever pass the Bechdel Test.\nTwo named female characters:\nCheck. Who talk to each other :\nCheck. About something other than a\nman: Check.\nI know the Bechdel test started as a\njoke in a comic, but it has build a lot\ncultural momentum behind it to the\npoint that some cinemas in Sweden\nhave decided to use it as a ratings\nsystem.\nIt is shocking how few films actually\npass this test but I really don\u2019t think\nthis is the metric we should use to\ndecide if a movie avoids gender bias.\nI believe there should be films with\njust men in, in exactly the same way\nthere should be films with just women\nin, and like the real world you\u2019d kind\nof hope there would be films with\npeople of all genders interacting. The\nproblem with the Bechdel Test is that\nit only applies to one film at a time, not\nthe landscape of cinema.\nRun Lola Run? Fail. The Devil Wears\nPrada? Pass! Maybe there is a problem\nwith the Bechdel Test, but clearly we\nneed some mechanism to fill the\nvacuum of women on screen. My\nquestion is, whose job is it?\nThe Producers?\nWho decides who directs a movie?\nThe producers. Who produces films?\n80% of the time it\u2019s men. Now I think\nthis is the place where, with the right\nkind of lobbying and nudging, we can\nslowly change the number of women\nin films. These are the positions in\nwhich women need to be given more\nopportunity. The producer brings\ntogether the script, actors, and\ndirector - plenty of opportunity to\nbring other women on board.\nI hear you cry \u201cExactly, I agree with\nPete! It\u2019s all the producers\u2019 fault!\u201d.\nYou recline into your chair and relax\nfeeling kind of smug.\nNOPE. It\u2019s our fault.\nPete Brook\nthehussingtonpost.blogspot.co.uk\nWill Sweden\u2019s Bechdel Rating Work?\nThe Directors?\nFemales are underrepresented\nbehind the camera. Only 7% of\ndirectors are women. Of the entries\nto Sundance Film Festival, women\ndirect 16% of entries and produce\n30%. Obviously these festivals are\nfostering more female talent, but they\nseem to be a sticking point for lots of\nfemale talent. Women just don\u2019t move\non to direct blockbusters. Sundance\nsponsored Dr. Stacy Smith to do some\ngreat research and found that having\nfemale directors also increases the\nnumber of women on set, but still\nnot to 50:50. However the increase\nof women on set will hopefully mean\nmore women get a foot in the door.\nThe Audience?\nWhy do producers do what they do? It\u2019s because they get paid by people going\nto see their movies. You vote with your wallet and in 2012 the paying public spent\n$10,957,460,255 at the cinema. Currently women make up 51% of cinemagoers\nbut are represented by having 1/3 of the presence on screen. Women spend $5\nbillion a year going to the cinema, and producers don\u2019t think that sounds like\ndissatisfaction. This gender imbalance won\u2019t change until male-oriented films\nstart to make less money than a more mixed bag.\nIf you see a film by a female director whom you admire, buy the DVD, tell\nyour friends to go see the movie, because without legislation that impinges on\ncreative people (no one wants that) it\u2019s the only way the situation will improve.\nFinally, the thing that annoys me most is that because of the gender bias in\nfront of and behind the camera we are missing angles, stories and entertainment\nthat would actually make the producers money!\nA gender-bias test that applied to a studios\u2019 output for a year which measures\nthe number of movies that it releases that pass the Bechdel test, the ratio of\nmale/female leads across its films and the ratio of male/female directors would\nbe a start.\nFire in the Blood showing\nFREE SHOWING!\nTrailer: http://bit.ly/VkvEo1\n\u201cA shocking expos\u00e9 of how pharmaceutical companies use patent law to\nkeep profits unconscionably high even at the expense of peoples\u2019 lives, and a\nplea for universal access to affordable, life-saving generic medicines. FIRE\nIN THE BLOOD tells the story of how Western pharmaceutical companies\nand governments aggressively blocked access to affordable AIDS drugs for\nthe countries of Africa and the global south - causing ten million or more\nunnecessary deaths. It is the inspiring story of the improbable group of people\nwho decided to fight back. Shot on four continents and including contributions\nfrom global figures such as President Bill Clinton, Bishop Desmond Tutu and\neconomist Joseph Stiglitz, FIRE IN THE BLOOD is the never-before-told true\nstory of the remarkable coalition which came together to stop \u2018the Corporate\nCrime of the Century\u2019 and save millions of lives.\u201d (copyright: International Film\nCircuit)\nTitle : Fire In The Blood\nCost : FREE\nDate, 25th November, Monday\nVenue : LT16, SAF Building, SK Campus\nwww.mybikemyworld.com\ntheguardian.com\nhuffingtonpost.co.uk\ndeath. Since this Game is a special one\nfor which tributes are selected from\nthe existing pool of victors you also\nget to see many victors with a variety\nof weaspons, skills and both of them in\naction. Understandably the handheld\ncamera has been replaced to offer a\nbigger, grander picture particularly so\nfor the scenes of the chariot sequence.\nAnother aspect to look forward\nto in this series is the fashion; Effie\u2019s\n(Elizabeth Banks) outfits for the sheer\noutrageousness accompanied by\nfrankly alarming attention to matching\ndetails that would make even Lady\nGaga jealous \u2013 and we do get a good\nvariety of ensembles with one truly \u00e0\nla Alexander McQueen! \u2013 and Katniss\u2019\nfor the imaginative realisation of her\nsymbolic costumes and makeup.\nThe film ultimately comes to a\nsignificant twist of an ending setting\nthe big scene for what is likely to be\nthe most anticipated films over the\nnext two years. Much remains untold\nand unsolved but with such steady\nand calm take as demonstrated in this\nsecond work I think we can reliably\nexpect high quality feature from the\ncast and crew should the odds be\nagain in their favour.\n\n"

In 1924 the manuscript of an\nextraordinary book was smuggled out of post-revolutionary Russia and published in the West. We\ndescribed the slow awakening of citizen D-503, an\nengineer in the apparently utopian One State. The\nurban nation is made entirely from glass to facilitate\nsurveillance and its citizens cultivate a dispassionate\npreoccupation in maximising productive efficiency.\nD-503 is tortured and confused as he finds himself\nfalling in love, a cardinal sin under the regime.\nZamyatin\u2019s writing is a heavily satirical response\nto his own youthful Bolshevik sympathies and\nhis experience of the Tyne shipyards during the\nFirst World War. The book, with its subversive\ncommentary, had the dubious honour of being the\nfirst ever to be banned by the Soviet censorship\nbureau. Zamyatin was exiled from Russia and, like\nall great authors, died in poverty and obscurity in\nParis in 1937. However, his work lived on and its\nimportance to 20th Century dystopian literature\ncannot be understated.

By 2008 Dad had\nreplaced the BMW with a Range\nRover. It consumed the driveway\nwith its girth.\nI remember being gathered\naround the television. The Madines\nwere having a quiet night in for\nJoe\u2019s nineteenth birthday. Mammy\nnursed our new sister Eithne in her\nlap. Dad\u2019s hair was untidy and his tie\nwas crooked. He never left the office\nnow.\n\u201cAlmost forgot,\u201d he said, passing\nme a copy of CarSport magazine.\nWith Joe looking over my shoulder\nI began to flick through the pages.\nA poster slipped out from the\nmagazine\u2019s spine. Unfolding it\nrevealed the most the most garish car\nI had ever laid eyes on. Its crenulated\nwheel spokes grinned at me from the\nglossy page. The spoiler protruded\nlike the hilt of a blade from its\nscabbard. To me, in that moment,\na sword and a car were one and\nthe same. When wielded properly\nboth became an extension of the\nhand. With enthusiastic conviction I\nshowed the poster to Dad.\nI announced that it would be my\nfirst car. Joe nodded his head in\nagreement.\nDad contorted his face and\nwhistled before replying,\n\u201cNow lads, if you\u2019re looking a\nNissan Skyline, you\u2019d need to start\nsaving.\u201d\n\u201cRight then, we will, won\u2019t we\nShane?\u201d said Joe, poking fun. \u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t always have a fast car, Dad.\nYou have to start somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t have a roof over\nyour heads much longer, if you don\u2019t\nwatch it lads,\u201d retorted Dad.\n\u201cWe might as well aim high,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSure, everybody\u2019s at it.\u201d\nDad stole a glance at my mother.\nHis eyes were red and raw. He looked\nunnerved as he chided me, \u201cNo more\nof that talk out of you.\u201d He took out\na cigarette and left the room. The\nbuoyant atmosphere had collapsed.\nThe baby began to whimper over\nthe knell of the television, \u201c\u2026as\nDublin house prices continue to\nfall.\u201d\n***\nMickey Bishop gave us work as a\nmechanic on weekends. I worked\nincessantly, leaving and returning in\ntotal darkness. Sitting in school on\nMonday mornings I was aware of my\nhands. They would be smeared in oil,\nmy fingers throbbing. I\u2019d tell myself\nit was worth the effort. Everything\nhad its price.\nJoe and I would count the money\non Sunday evenings and place it\ninto a glass jar which we concealed\nbeneath a loose floorboard.\nOne Friday I arrived home from\nwork. The kitchen light was still on.\nDad was visible through the frosted\nglass, hunched over the table with\nhis head bowed. I went in. He barely\nacknowledged me. His stubble was\nthick, his face thin. The acrid smell\nof whiskey filled the room. He spoke\nwith a brusque tone.\n\u201cDan Harrington didn\u2019t turn up to\nwork. His won\u2019t answer the phone. I\nwas relying on one of his contracts\nto cover my costs.\u201d\n\u201cHave you got enough to cover it?\u201d\nI asked.\nHe snapped \u201cGet you to bed!\u201d\nbringing his fist down hard on the\ntable on the final word.\nA chill ran up my spine as I left\nthe kitchen. As I climbed the stairs\nmy spirits were doused by a sense of\nforeboding. Falling into bed I looked\nthrough the skylight. A thick veil of\ncloud masked the stars.\nThat evening stands out in my\nmemory. It was like a rug pulled\nfrom beneath our feet. With each day\nthereafter the lives of the Madines\nbegan to shatter and fall.\n***\nWe shared our fate with many\nothers as the fabric of Ireland\u2019s\ndestiny swiftly unravelled. Dad put\nthe car up for sale. Nobody was\ninterested. Mickey Bishop turned up\nthe following Sunday. \u201cDan\u2019s done a\nrunner, Aodh\u00e1n,\u201d he said as he drew\non a cigarette. No one ever smoked\nin the house. Dad said nothing. His\nface said it all. Mickey continued.\n\u201cNo one has had word of him for\nthree days.\u201d\nDad finally mustered a reply,\nfighting tears.\n\u201cI have the largest stake in the\nbusiness\u2026I\u2019m liable.\u201d\nFrom then on he spent his time\non the phone. He demanded\npayments and defended his own.\nThe bills slowly amassed beneath the\nletterbox. I walked into the kitchen\none evening to find him facing my\nmother. Tears ran down her cheeks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve three mouths to feed. You\ncan\u2019t touch our savings Aodh\u00e1n,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t stay liquid, we\u2019ll lose\neverything. I\u2019ve no choice, Sarah.\u201d\nThe silence that followed was\nshattered by the doorbell. A voice\nrang out, \u201cWe need our wages,\nAodh\u00e1n!\u201d\nDad turned towards me, \u201cGet rid\nof them, Shane.\u201d In that moment I\nknew that his business was beyond\nsaving. That car was my last ray of\nhope.\n***\nGuarantee day was the final nail\nin the coffin. Joe and I had taken\nGranda Michael out for a pint to\ncelebrate our earnings. We\u2019d raised\njust shy of three thousand euros\nin eight months. Walking home\nGranda slapped us both on the\nback as we rounded the corner.\nDad was smoking on the doorstep.\nThe glow of his cigarette danced\nin the darkness like a crosshair\u2026\nand by God he was shaking like a\nhunted man. Barely able to stand, he\nfollowed us inside.\nMammy was bawling her eyes out\nin the sitting room. The lights were\nout and the television cast dancing\nshadows on the wall. Eithne was\ncurled up in the corner. Granda went\nto her and picked her up.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d asked Joe. Mammy\ntook a moment to gather herself.\n\u201cThe banks rejected your father\u2019s\napplication for a loan. The business\nis dead.\u201d\nGranda Michael winced as though\nhe\u2019d been struck across the face. He\nturned to face my father.\n\u201cNo, Aodh\u00e1n, no\u2026What about the\nmen under you? What about their\nchildren?\u201d\nJoe sank into the sofa and bit his\nlip. I couldn\u2019t move. Mammy clasped\nher knees to her chest and closed her\nRaw Words: Part Two\nThe second installment of Eoghan Totten\u2019s short story\neyes as she spoke.\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their own. Our savings\nare gone. The mortgage is two\nmonths in arrears.\u201d\nIt was difficult to watch Granda\nsuffer as he relived hardships he\nthought were confined to the past.\nHe kept whispering \u201cThis isn\u2019t\nhappening\u201d over and over. In that\nmoment I realised that nothing is\nsacred, that all hope can die and\nevery dream be pillaged. I knew what\nI had to do. Climbing the stairs I\nentered Joe\u2019s room. My tears started\nas I lifted the floorboard. Joe jumped\nup when I came back with the glass\njar in my arms.\n\u201cNo, Shane,\u201d he said as he reached\nout and touched the jar.\nDad moved for the first time in\nthose long minutes. Sweat glistened\non his forehead. The sinews on his\nwithered temple twitched. He licked\nhis lips and asked, \u201cHow much?\u201d\nI replied \u201cThree thousand.\u201d\nHe paced across the room with his\nhands extended. I gave him the jar.\nHe cradled it in his arms.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a roof over our heads,\u201d\nhe whispered. \u201cFor now.\u201d\nHe dropped like a stone to the\nfloor. His moans were like that of\na wounded animal. Granda bent\ndown to him, placed one hand on\nDad\u2019s cheek and kissed his forehead.\nHe held Eithne close with the other\nhand. Joe gave Mammy\u2019s shoulder a\nreassuring squeeze\u2026and I watched\nas my family was brought to its\nknees.\nThe image of my father gripping\nthat jar of money will stay with me\nforever. He had been humbled in\nfront of his wife, his children, even\nhis father. In that moment he had no\nchoice but to extinguish the dreams\nof his children. His business had\nbeen ravished by economic rot, a\nplague that would smother our lives\nfor many years to come. Things\nnever returned to the way they were.\nIn a way, I never left that sitting\nroom.\nI used to wonder who was to\nblame. I\u2019d spend hours harbouring\nthoughts of revenge that ricocheted\nback and forth in my mind, when\none day I simply stopped. It didn\u2019t\nmatter. A myriad of higher powers\nhad ploughed the soil of Ireland\nand when it became sterile they got\nout when they could. Things went\nforward until they failed. When the\ncrash hit we had to bear a financial\ncross whose shared load would break\nthe backs of millions\u2026and there\u2019d be\nno relief.\nNow, I lament what followed. The\ndeath of friendships spawned family\nfeuds. Dan Harrington abandoned\nmy father. He in turn had no choice\nbut to abandon those workers who\nhad put their trust in him. Mickey\nBishop never calls. Dad is dead\ninside. We can never look beyond\ntomorrow.\nDad was right. There was a price to\npay for everything. Now, we\u2019re forever in debt.\nIf you are interested in submitting\nyour own short fiction to Felix, don\u2019t\nhesitate to email us at books.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk .\nMaciej Matuszewski talks about London\u2019s\nfirst comedy book festival\nChortle Festival\nDear Dan Brown\nRobert Finn\nThe bestselling author Dan Brown has\nthrilled and infuriated readers in equal\nmeasure. With outlandish plots, insipid\nprose and wilful and repeated misuse of\nthe word \u2018facts\u2019, it is somehow difficult\nto see how he ever managed to get\npublished in first place. Despite all of\nthis the author has somehow managed\nto amass a legion of loyal fans. Up-andcoming comedian Robert Finn, however,\nwas not afraid to brave these fans\u2019 wrath\nin this scathing and vitriolic critique of\nBrown\u2019s writing skills.\nFirst performed at last year\u2019s Edinburgh\nFringe to broadly positive reviews, the\nshow was in the form of an open letter\nto Brown from a struggling prospective\nauthor. This was certainly an interesting\nshow, combining both good humour\nand fascinating insight into the oft\nmisunderstood publishing industry and\nthe process of writing a novel. While\ncertainly not for fans of Dan Brown, this\nwas a very enjoyable hour for people\ninterested in books and writing.\nFinn is certainly a name to look out for in\nthe future.\nThe Trade Secret\nRob Newman\nRob Newman first made his name in the\n1980s as a stand-up comedian working\nwith David Baddiel. However, in more\nrecent years he has managed to successfully\nre-brand himself as a popular novelist. His\nlatest book, The Trade Secret, is a historical\nnovel set at the start of the seventeenth\ncentury. The novel follows two friends as\nthey attempt to discover a hidden oil well\nunder the abandoned Temple of Mithras in\nPersia.\nBased on a true story that Newman found\nin the Rare Books Room of the British\nLibrary, this looks to be an exciting globe\ntrotting adventure, taking place in England,\nPersia and Italy.\nSpeaking at the Festival, Newman made\nclear how the book was born from the deep\ninterest he has in this period. He spoke of\nhow the events that that he writes about\nmarked the beginning of the modern age\nand how they have an impact on the world\u2019s\ngeopolitical situation even to this day.\nWhile I don\u2019t normally read historical\nfiction, I might be tempted to check this\none out.\nThe Simpsons and their\nMathematical Secrets\nSimon Singh\nMuch has already been said on these pages\nabout Imperial alumnus\u2019 Simon Singh\u2019s\nlatest work, which explores the hidden\nmathematical depths of the popular\ncartoons The Simpsons and Futurama.\nIn his festival show, one of a series of\npromotional appearances for the book\ntaking place around the country, Singh\naimed to give a brief outline of what the\nbook is all about.\nIt turns out that the writers of these shows\nare surprisingly mathematically literate,\nwith one even leaving a maths PhD to\njoin the writing team. As such, a standard\nepisode is usually filled with mathematical\nreferences \u2013 some obvious, many others far\nmore subtle. Singh has clearly put in a lot of\nresearch to identify even the most obscure\nof these.\nDuring his talk Singh showed how he was\nclearly very passionate about the subject\nmatter \u2013 with his sheer joy about working\non a book that combines both The Simpsons\nand maths never failing to show through.\nThis seems to be a book to look for.\nI really wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from\nthe Chortle Comedy Books Festival \u2013 an\nevent hosted by the comedy news website\nChortle. After all, what would such an\nevent even entail? It turns out that I\nneedn\u2019t have worried. The festival was an\neclectic mix of comedy shows related to\nbooks and discussions of books written\nby high profile comedians.\nWith a host of different comedians and\nother speakers ranging from Richard\nHerring to Shappi Khorsandi and Robin\nInce, there was something here for\neverybody. Taking place in the August\nsurroundings of Ealing Town Hall, some\nevents were packed and boisterous while\nothers were more sparsely attended \u2013\nallowing for a more intimate discussion\nbetween the speaker and the audience.\nAll in all, this was a very enjoyable\nexperience, with the talks, in general,\nbeing both witty and interesting. I\nrecommend that you look out for future\ncomedy events hosted by Chortle.\nIRISHTIMES.COM\n\n"

In addition, because the keys\nare going to be different for each\nsession, the compromise of a secret\nkey on the server will not cause the\ncompromise of the session keys,\nthereby enabling perfect forward\nsecrecy. The downside to this\nprotocol is the increased complexity\nin implementation, and a possible\nperformance hit on the server due\nto increased complexity. However,\nTwitter has written that they have\nnot noticed any adverse effects in\nterms of performance, and that\nthe increased security is worth\nthe slight increase in complexity.\nOne problem still remains in\nall of these security measures:\ntechnological advancement. With\nthe NSA storing information storing\nvast amount of encrypted traffic,\nthere is a chance that these traffic\ncan still be retroactively decrypted\nin the future. This is because many\nof the cryptography technique rest\nEncryption moving forward\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nOsama Awaara\nTechnology Editors\nThe competition in the wearable technology sector is growing extremely\nquickly. Each company is trying to come up with that one knock-out\nproduct that will allow them to dominate. Sony has taken a completely\nnew approach with yes, you read right a Wig. If this product will ever\nbe released is a big question, would be interesting though right?\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to\ndate with the newest, wierdest and most futuristic things around\nSony\u2019s SmartWig\niPad Maxi\nSomehow , somewhere a rumour sprang up on the internet that Apple\nwas planning a new larger iPad, with a diagonal screen size of 12.9 inches.\nTo be perfectly honest this seems like a bit of strange rumour. Why\nrelease a product into a market that seems to prefer smaller products?\nThe recent spate of NSA tapping data\nand storing huge amount of internet\ntraffic has been rather worrying.\nThe expos\u00e9 courtesy of Edward\nSnowden has made end-users more\naware of the need for encryption,\nand accelerated the process of\nenhancing the security between end\nusers and the service providers at\nmany big names. Twitter is the latest\ncompany to join the ranks of Google\nand Facebook by implementing\nPerfect Forward Secrecy on their\nservers. This is a much needed\nmove. The end user might not\nnotice anything different in their\nexperience, but NSA will certainly\nhave a harder time trying to pry\nopen your private communications.\nTransport Layer Security (TLS)\nand its predecessor, Secure Sockets\nLayer (SSL) are the most widely\nused protocols in your web browser\nto encrypt traffic between the\nuser and service providers such as\nGoogle and Twitter. When you see\na \u201clock\u201d icon in the address bar of\nyour browser, and a web address\nbeginning with \u201chttps\u201d, that\u2019s a sign\nthat TLS is being used to encrypt\nyour traffic. TLS works in two steps.\nFirstly, your browser will perform\na \u201chandshake\u201d with the server to,\namongst other things, decide on\nthe cryptographic algorithm to\nuse for the entire session, and a\n\u201cshared secret key\u201d, known as a\nsession key, that will be used to\nencrypt and decrypt the traffic.\nThen, the server and your browser\nwill transfer data to each other using\nthe session key and an algorithm\nthat was agreed on. The same key is\nused for encryption and decryption,\nand therefore the algorithm used is\ncalled a symmetric-key algorithm.\nHowever, most websites\nimplement a form of TLS that\ndoes not exhibit the \u201cperfect\nforward secrecy\u201d property, and this\nweakness lies in method being used\nfor handshaking, in particular the\nstep when the shared secret key is\nbeing transmitted. This is because\nmost servers uses the RSA algorithm\nto exchange the shared secret, a\ntype of public-key cryptosystem.\nA public-key cryptosystem is\nan asymmetric algorithm, having\ndifferent keys for encryption and\ndecryption. The public-key is used\nfor encryption, and is public and\nknown to all. The private-key is used\nfor decryption, and is only known to\nthe owner. This means that anyone\ncan encrypt messages using the\npublic-key that only the recipient\nwith the private-key can decrypt.\nRSA is such a system, by deriving\nthe public and private keys from a\npair of randomly generated prime\nnumbers. The strength in this system\nlies in the fact that it is infeasible to\ntry and \u201ccrack\u201d an encrypted message\nor \u201cfind\u201d the private-key from the\npublic-key in a reasonable time.\nMost servers implement TLS by\nasking browsers to generate some\nrandom secret, and then sending\nthat secret encrypted using the\nserver\u2019s public key back to the\nserver. If someone can, by means\nas simple as obtaining a court\norder, obtain the server\u2019s private\nkey, then all communication to\nand from the server can then be\nretroactively decrypted because\nthe private key is essentially the\nmaster key in the grand scheme.\nThis is a violation of the \u201cperfect\nforward secrecy\u201d property that\nstates that even if one of the secret\nkeys are compromised, the session\nkeys are not all compromised.\nIn order to obtain this property,\nanother form of protocol for key\nexchange has to be used. The\n\u201cDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange\u201d is\nan example. This process can be\nillustrated by a very simple analogy\nas seen in the diagram. Essentially,\nany eavesdropper will not be able\nto trivially obtain the shared secret\nYong Wen Chua\nTechnology Editor\non the belief that cracking them are\nequivalent to solving two well known\nproblems that are known to be in\nthe complexity class NP: the prime\nfactorisation and discrete logarithm\nproblems. This is equivalent to\nsaying that there are no computers\nthat can solve these problems\nin a reasonable amount of time.\nHowever, it has been proven that a\nquantum computer would be able to\nsolve these problems in a reasonable\namount of time, and if someone can\nprove that P = NP (one of the biggest\nunsolved problems in Computer\nScience), then this no longer holds.\nIn the digital age where\nconnectivity is ever more prevalent,\nit is still important to have some kind\nof privacy. Aside from the possible\nthreats of governments trying\nto silence dissent, simple things\nlike keeping your communication\naway from an annoying ex-girl/\nboyfriend can be as important.\nCommon sense computer\nComputers have many things, but common sense is not one of them.\nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon in the US are running an algorithm\nwhich allows a computer to teach itself common sense.

This is a nice\nexample of how what\u2019s on the catwalk is allowed\nto be totally cooky compared to bog standard\n\u2018clothes\u2019. Does anyone think that this is the kind\nof outfit you\u2019d be able to wear to Tesco with three\nkids in tow? No! Does anyone give a flying fuck?\nAlso no! Once you look a bit closer you get to\nsee the nicer touches \u2013 her hat also contains\nanonymous, tropical-looking flowers, which\nare probably reminiscent of where toucans live.\nI\u2019m sure that this has a deep and meaningful\nmessage, probably to do with the reckless\ndestruction of the beautiful environment that\ninspired this outfit. But hey, who are we to dwell\non such things? Let\u2019s sit back and enjoy the pretty\ncolours present in this dazzling outfit.\nT\nhis was designed by Gareth Pugh, who\ndescribes his style as, \u201cthe struggle\nbetween light and darkness\u201d. Anyone\nwho can\u2019t see this immediately from\nthe picture and thinks it just looks\nlike someone dressed as a spike is obviously\nnot trying very hard and should probably enrol\nin a Horizons philosophy course. This is a\nMETAPHOR, people. It\u2019s MEANINGFUL.\nAnyway, I like this one because it\u2019s clearly\nbatshit cray-cray. It looks like someone began\nwith a triangle, gave it a ruff and called it an\noutfit. This is the kind of creative outlet civil\nengineers just don\u2019t get to experience. No matter\nhow much they want to make a spiky dam, they\nget told \u2018that\u2019s stupid\u2019 and that it would lead to\n\u201cHolland being crushed by billions of tonnes\nof water\u201d. Well, no such restriction applies to\nfashion. You want a spike, you get a goddamn\nspike.\nT\nhis colourful little number is being\nworn by the amusingly-named\nMilagros Schmoll for New York\u2019s\nFashion Week. We like this primarily\nbecause it\u2019s colourful and pretty but\nalso because you can see her underwear. This\ndesign is all about conflict \u2013 just look at the\nhostility on her face against the friendly and\ncolourful outfit and the way the pink and the\ngreen of her dress fight for dominance. But that\u2019s\nenough of that \u2013 if this article carries on like this,\nwe might end up seriously discussing fashion,\nand we absolutely can\u2019t have that, can we?\nY\nes, it has been what every student\nhere yearned for for years. \u201cWE\nNEED A CREATIVE OUTLET!\u201d\nwe cry in block caps. \u201cWE HAVE\nALL THESE COLOURFUL\nAND STYLISH IDEAS BUT NO MEDIUM\nTO EXPRESS THEM!\u201d Well, finally there is a\nsolution to your problems.

After intense negotiations\nbetween the P5+1 nations- the\nPermanent members of the UN\nSecurity Council and Germanyand Iran was signed in Geneva. The\nagreement is one, which manages to\nease the pressure on Iran for a six-month interim period. It\u2019s perhaps\na small step towards improving\nunderstanding between western states\nand a rather unpredictable nation.\nIran tried to hold talks with the US\ngovernment in 2003 to come up with a\nnuclear deal. The Bush administration\nbelieved, however, that since Iran was\nweak and battered by sanctions it\nwould not be able to enrich Uranium\nand therefore decided not to hold\nany talks. As a result, the number of\ncentrifuges in Iran has gone up from\n174 to 19,000. Although there are\ntough sanctions in place, the cost of\nenriching nuclear fuel for an oil rich\ncompany like Iran is relatively small.\nThis realization led to the Geneva\nConvention and the subsequent\nagreement. As a result of this deal,\nIran will not be allowed to enrich\nuranium above 5% and any further\nenriched Uranium would have to be\noxidized. Furthermore, there will be\ngreater access provided to inspectors\nin the nuclear sites, which includes\ndaily access to Natanz and Fordotwo of Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites. This\ndeal, however, manage to shut any\nof the fuselages down. If Iran abides\nby the rules, there will be no new\nnuclear related sanctions for the next\nsix months. This, however, does not\nguarantee any new nuclear sanctions\nafter the aforesaid time period.\nFurthermore, the sanctions on its\ntrade of gold and precious metals,\ncar-making sector and petrochemical\nexports will be suspended. This deal\nhas culminated in about 7 billion\ndollars of sanction release, which is a\nfraction of the sanctions currently in\nplace against the country.\nThe deal has been met with mixed\nreactions around the world. Israel\u2019s\nPresident Benjamin Netanyahu has\ncalled the deal \u2018a historic mistake\u2019.\nIran is a country, which has publicly\ndisplayed its dislike of Israel, causing\nit to be seen as a threat by the Israeli\ngovernment. Last week itself, Iran\u2019s\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini\ncompared Israeli\u2019s to \u2018rabid dogs\u2019. Thus,\nIsrael desires a complete dismantling\nof Iran\u2019s nuclear program but the fact\nthat the Iranian nuclear program has\nbeen legitimized for an interim period\nhas caused it a lot of worry.\nThis deal has also been a source of\nworry for Saudi Arabia. Israel may be\nwilling to reach a diplomatic solution\nwith Iran but Saudi Arabia sees itself\nin the middle of an endless proxy\nwar in the region and it wishes that\nthe western powers, united states in\nparticular, be involved in this war.\nThe Saudi rulers see the Middle\nEast through a sectarian lens. Saudi\nArabia is a nation of a Sunni majority\nand it does not wish to see a Shiite\nmajority country gain power. In Iran\nitself, people see the deal with an air\nof skepticism but are excited by the\nprospects of reduced sanctions and\nbetter relations with the west.\nKartikeya Rana\nPolitics Editor\nA\nfter a political turmoil\nthat took a toll on the\nlives of thousands\nof hapless innocent\nSyrians, peace talks\nbetween opposing factions has\nemerged as the only recourse for the\nmultitude. The situation on ground\nhas deteriorated beyond recognition-derelict streets, blast ravaged homes,\nunemployed youth, crying orphans\nand polio-infested children abound\nthe Syrian land.\nThe leaders of the Syrian National\nCoalition, President Assad\u2019s\nadversaries are meeting to agree its\nstance on the so-called \u201cGeneva 2\u201d\ntalks, which aim to end Syria\u2019s two-and-a-half year civil war by creating\na transitional governing body. They\nstrongly demand that the President\u2019s\nreign be called off and that President\nAssad relinquish his office as the head\nof the state.\nA few other factors bolster\nAssad\u2019s claim to hold onto the top\nposition. Ever more Syrians reject\nthe opposition coalition\u2019s authority,\nseeing it as an ineffective group\nexiles that have failed to supply arms\nor aid to fighters on the ground. On\nNovember 4th one of the most senior\npro-Western rebel commanders in\nnorthern Syria resigned in frustration,\nciting divisions among fighting\nfactions and the fecklessness of the\nnational coalition as reasons. On\nOctober 15th 50 groups, most of them\nIslamist-leaning, announced that they\nno longer recognized its authority.\nSyria also claims to have destroyed all\nof its chemical arms by now.\nDamascus has decisively said Assad\nwill stay in his post at least until his\nterms ends in 2014 and that he may\nrun for re-election.\nThese demands are being asserted\nby the National Coalition, which\nclaims to be the only representative of\nthe Syrian people, but which doesn\u2019t\nrepresent even a majority of the\nopposition groups.\nAlso, the coalition members demand\na certain fulfillment of promises made\nby intervening nations- the promise\nto ensure that humanitarian corridors\nwere opened so that aid could reach\nrebel-held areas currently blockaded\nby the regime, the promise to release\nopposition detainees and the promise\nto bring an end to air raids. In an\ninterview with The Sunday Telegraph,\nhis first with a Western newspaper,\nAhmed Jarba said he was willing to\ntake part in the long-awaited talks.\n\u201cYes, but do you think we can sit with\nthe regime whilst there are people\nin Syria who can\u2019t even drink water?\nWe have been promised by the West\nthat these humanitarian issues will be\nsolved before the conference.\u201d\nAmerica who supports the ousting\nof President Assad and Russia, the\nregime\u2019s staunch supporters have\njointly agreed on the need to end the\nwar and reach a peaceful agreement.\nHowever, Saudi Arabia, which has\naligned itself with American forces in\nSyria, has a differing call. The Saudis\nsee an axis of Shia mischief, stretching\nfrom Tehran through Baghdad and\nDamascus to Hizbullah in Lebanon,\nas their biggest threat, and Syria as\nits linchpin. On the other hand, Iran\nhas invested billions to prop up Mr\nAssad\u2019s regime and to retain a vital\nlink to Hizbullah.\nMr Assad has felt stronger since\nAmerica failed to carry out a threat\nto punish the regime with missiles\nfor its mass-murderous sarin-gas\nattack on August 21st. Saudi Arabia,\ninfuriated by America\u2019s loss of nerve\nover punishing the Syrian regime with\nmissile strikes after its sarin attack,\nhas embarked on a project to create\na new national army in the south of\nSyria rather than working through\nthe Supreme Military Command,\nthe coalition\u2019s armed wing based in\nTurkey. For months it has reportedly\nbeen training 5,000 rebels in Jordan,\nwith help from French and more\nrecently Pakistani forces.\nSevere malnutrition is reported,\nespecially among children in areas\nbesieged by government forces. The\nUN says two in five Syrians now need\nemergency aid. Neighboring countries\nwarn they can no longer cope with\nthe scale of the refugee influx, the\nmost dramatic since the Second\nWorld War. Displaced Syrians now\nmake up nearly a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s\npopulation. To add to the pall of grief,\nAl Qaeda is waging polio biological\nwarfare in Syria. The Poliovirus is very\ncontagious and thrives in an infected\nperson\u2019s throat and intestines. It could\nbe that Al Qaeda is seeking vengeance\nas America in the past had abused\npolio vaccination program to find out\nOsama bin Laden.\nThe stalemate in Syria needs\nimmediate redressing. The unrest\nthat has gripped the Middle East has\nSyria as its epicenter. If not addressed,\noutbreak of epidemics and economic\ninstability might only aggravate the\ndifficulties faced by innocent Syrians.\nAnd redressing can only be effectively\nachieved by show of sympathy and a\ncompromising spirit from both the\nfactions of a warring nation.\nPresident Assad\u2019s adversaries meet in the wake of ending the Syrian Crisis\nOXFAM AUSTRALIA\nThe next question to ask is- why\ndid US partake in this deal? By going\nforward with the deal, the US has\ntried to make a deal with a state,\nwhich not only has a very anti-American sentiment but is also a\nsponsor of terrorism. As a result of\nthis agreement, it has also managed to\naggravate its closest ally in the middle\neast- Israel.\nI believe that one reason why the\nUS signed this deal is because it does\nnot want another war in the Middle\nEast. The frequency with which\nthe US has been going to war in the\nregion in the 21st century has had a\ndetrimental effect on its standing at\nhome as well as around the world. As\na result, the Obama administration\nfound it particularly hard to garner\nsupport domestically for a military\nintervention in Syria. Thus, gaining\nsupport for a full-fledged war with\nIran would be particularly hard.\nHowever, the immense pressure it\nput on Iran due to the secret nuclear\nprogram made a war with the nation\nvery likely. By signing this interim\ndeal, the US has been able to ease\nsome of the tension and has reduced\nthe probability of a war taking place\nin the near future. But this does not\nnecessarily mean that the tensions will\nnot rise again in the future.\nThe deal signed is an interim one\nand the pressure is reduced only for\na period of six months after which,\nfurther nuclear sanctions can be put\nin place. Thus, the idea that this deal\nis anything \u2018significant\u2019 is a misnomer.\nThe agreement can be simply seen as\na source of cautious optimism but not\nanything else.\nThe fact that there are some tactical\nconstraints on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\nhas of course made the world safer but\nthis is a nation, which has had a longstanding anti-American rhetoric.\nAround the same time the Geneva\ntalks were held, Ayatollah Khomeini\ngave a ferociously anti-American\nspeech to Iran\u2019s revolutionary guard\ncorps. Thus, it is unlikely that the\nnuclear aspirations of Iran are going\nto decrease in the near future even if\nthat is what the US wishes for. Once\nthis agreement is put into practice, it\nwould also be very hard to reinstate\nthe sanctions on a country with such\nstrong nuclear aspirations.\nThis is only the first stage of a very\nlong and difficult road. The next step\nfor the \u2018P5+1\u2019 nations would be to try\nand close some of the fuselages. It will\nbe interesting to see how they manage\nto ease tensions when the six-month\ninterim period comes to an end.\nnypost\n\n"

As with any year, there are strong\ncontenders in every field and it\u2019s\ncertainly too early to be betting on a\nwinner.\nSo over the next few weeks, Felix\nFilm will be giving you a breakdown of\nthe actors, actresses and films that will\nbe grabbing the headlines in the near\nfuture but this is in no way a definitive\nlist, as some of the films haven\u2019t even\nbeen released here yet.\nThis final week in our feature is the\nBest Picture category.\nReady...\nSteady...\nGo!\n2014 at the Oscars: Best Picture\nThe Wolf of Wall Street\nThere\u2019s a reason why Martin Scorsese\nis one of the most respected directors\naround, and with DiCaprio on top\nform, tackling a very timely subject\nmatter (greed, corruption of the 1%) is\nan extra bonus ingredient required to\nalmost certainly make the cut.\nNebraska\nAlexander Payne\u2019s heartfelt father-son\nroadtrip movie is a charming, smooth-ly-directed, carefully paced, nostalgic\nblack-and-white delight. Bruce Dern\nis quietly moving with very few words,\nwhich pretty much sums up the film\u2019s\ngeneral atmosphere.\nAugust: Osage County\nWith a cast this good, it could end\nup as an overstuffed turkey, but early\nreviews indicate a warm response, although not overwhelmingly positive\nwhich is a disappointment given the\nnumber of A-list names involved. Still,\nit\u2019s early to completely rule this out.\nDallas Buyers Club\nAnchored by Matthew McConaughey\u2019s career-best turn, he\u2019s an\nHIV-positive man who takes matters\ninto his own hands to find drugs that\nactually work. There\u2019s compassion\nand fearless energy in its story, which\nis exactly what the Oscars look for.\nLone Survivor\nA potential dark horse in this year\u2019s\nrace is Peter Berg\u2019s (not normally\nsomeone associated with high-end\nawards) intense military action film\nthat has all the predictable but pow-erful, patriotic elements of heroism,\ncourage and survival.\nBefore Midnight\nJesse and Celine talk/fight/argue their\nway through yet another Before film\nthat shows what wonders a fantastic\nscript and two actors with faultless\nchemistry can do just by exchanging\nwords to one another. May look sim-ple, but it\u2019s so much more than that.\nBlue is the Warmest Colour\nThe highly graphic, extended sequences of lesbian sex as well as its\nthree-hour running time will certainly\nalienate some voters but this Palme\nd\u2019Or winner certainly deserves a mention for its powerful, unrelenting approach to its story-telling.\nBlue Jasmine\nWoody Allen is on tip-top form with\nhis wickedly funny, keenly observed\nfilm, with Cate Blanchett most definitely in the running for Best Actress\nthis year portraying what arguably is\nthis year\u2019s most fascinating, entertaining female character.\nAll is Lost\nJ. C. Chandor\u2019s sophomore directorial effort is unlikely to get much attention this year since a DVD release\ndate has already been set, as well as its\nalarmingly early online release date.\nVery few will see it, but it\u2019s one that\ndeserves to be seen and admired.\n12 Years a Slave\nOne of this year\u2019s most beloved critical darlings, Steve McQueen\u2019s brutal,\nunflinching slavery drama is as shocking as it is intensely moving. Already\na big winner at the Toronto International Film Festival, the film, as well\nas its cast, should gear up for some\ndeserved awards glory. The subject\nmatter is one that is tough to swallow,\nand traditionally such difficult films\nhave been overlooked by the Academy\nfor the sake of something brighter and\nshinier, but the undeniable force 12\nYears a Slave packs into its narrative\nwill be hard to ignore.\nGravity\nNot only are the critics on board with\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s terrifying new space\ndrama that will put you off flying to\nthe Moon forever, it\u2019s proving to be\nimmensely popular with the audiences worldwide as well. Having already\nbagged an impressive international\ngross of $500 million+, the film is\nshowing absolutely no signs of slowing down in its colossal box-office run.\nSandra Bullock\u2019s performance is phe-nomenal, but the real highlight here is\nthe technical aspect of the film - and\nso overall, a Best Picture nomination\nis most certain.\nSaving Mr Banks\nThe ultimate feel-good movie of the\nyear, this \u201copposites attract\u201d, behind-the-scenes telling of the production\nwoes of Walt Disney\u2019s Mary Poppins\nis one of the funniest Best Picture con-tenders. Emma Thompson and Tom\nHanks are a magical pair as they go\nhead-to-head over the rights of P. L.\nTravers\u2019 (Thompson) novel, and who\nknew there was so much touching\npersonal background stories in each\ncharacter to make one hell of a tear-jerker? A film that perfectly balances\ncomedy and drama, this is exactly the\nkind of film that moves the voters.\nAmerican Hustle\nDirector David O. Russell has yet\nto win an Oscar so perhaps here is\nhoping that this year, his luck will\nchange. Coming off the successes of\nThe Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, he has assembled a mighty\ncast (Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper,\nAmy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer\nLawrence) and the setting of the cool,\nsuave 1970s for his newest slick heist\nfilm. Very few have actually seen the\nfilm, and the release date is still quite\na while away, but given the amount of\npromotion and backing the studio is\ngiving, this is one to watch.\nThe Butler\nAlthough released in the States all\nthe way back in August, The Butler\ncertainly won\u2019t be escaping the minds\nof the Academy voters anytime soon.\nDirector Lee Daniels\u2019 name is one that\ncarries some weight in the industry,\nand thanks to the outstanding performances of Forest Whitaker and\nOprah Winfrey (the mega-famous,\nmega-rich chatshow host who makes\na welcome comeback to the screens),\nthis is a textbook example of how to\ndo an Oscar-bait, which must be why\nThe Weinstein Company picked it up\nfor distribution.\nCaptain Phillips\nDespite the controversy that surrounds how Captain Richard Phillips\nis depicted as a heroic leader when in\nfact some of his crew argue that he\nreally wasn\u2019t, Paul Greengrass\u2019 tense,\nclaustrophobic thriller is a palm-sweatingly effective, heart-thumping\nstory, Tom Hanks is hugely reliable, although the revelation here is Barkhad\nAbdi, the leader of the Somali pirates,\na first-time actor of such fearful,\nthreatening demeanour. It\u2019s smart,\nwell-paced and the closing scenes are\nincredibly stirring. If there\u2019s an action\nfilm to be nominated this year, it\u2019s this.\nInside Llewyn Davis\nA tragi-comedy in which we follow\nthe titular Llewyn Davis\u2019 (Oscar Isaac)\nstruggle in the little known music industry of the folk music genre, the\nCoen brothers\u2019 new film has an overall\nbleak tone that nevertheless finds time\nfor humour arising from entirely convincing scenarios. The Coen brothers\nhave justly been awarded with many\nhonours in the past, and their most\nrecent work deserves an equal amount\nof attention. With heartfelt performances as well as a killer soundtrack\nall performed by the talented cast, the\nCoens have once again struck gold.\nPhilomena\nToo British to be considered? The\nlowering of the film\u2019s certificate from\nits original R-rating to a more au-dience-friendly PG-13 will work to\nwiden the love and critical acclaim,\nwhere hopefully Dame Judi Dench\u2019s\nheart-wrenching performance will\nhelp elevate this deceptively sim-ple, straightforward \u201cbased on a true\nstory\u201d drama. The search for her\nlong-lost son is both a comical but ultimately powerful one for Philomena\nLee (Dench), with an unlikely but effective pairing between her and Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan).\nFruitvale Station\n2013\u2019s down-to-earth and genuine\nbreakout independent film is based on\nthe blood-boiling true story of how a\nyoung black citizen was accidentally\nmurdered by the police. It\u2019s neither\npreachy with needless emotions nor\ndry with tons of information.\nRush\nRon Howard\u2019s Formula 1 biopic is as\nexciting as it is informative, and even\nthose not familiar with Niki Lauda and\nJames Hunt will find themselves completely hooked by their rivalry and\nblown away by the adrenaline-pump-ing race sequences.\nHer\nA quirky, 21st Century rom-com in\nwhich our leading man falls in love\nwith the robot voice of his phone. It\u2019s\na funny, screwball comedy that takes\nthe story to places you would never\ninitially expect it to, which is why it\u2019s\nproving to be such a hit already.\nOut of the Furnace\nChristian Bale is out for blood, which\nis always an excellent way to start a\nmovie. It\u2019s described as being a gutsy,\nraw feature with Bale\u2019s powerful performance to top it all off - this alone\nshould be enough for the film to pave\nits way to awards glory.\nMandela: Long Walk to Freedom\nIt\u2019s that time of year for inspirational\nbiopics to start coming out, and with a\nfigure as legendary as Nelson Mandela, the film stands a real chance, what\nwith Idris Elba\u2019s outstanding performance that should work well in the\nfilm\u2019s favour.\nThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty\nBen Stiller\u2019s fifth feature as director\nis creating buzz for its wonderfully\ncreative mix of fantasy, comedy and\npoignancy. A Christmas Day release\ndate? Sounds like the perfect film for\nthe whole family. Something for the\nAcademy to consider? Maybe.\n\n"

This design could\nprotect areas against radiotherapy for instance, or it\ncould be used as a new strategy for camouflage.\nThe potential of the \u2018invisibility cloak\u2019 is unimaginable,\nanditonlyemphasisesthecreativeusesofmetamaterials.\nProgression in this field could generate a new era of\ntechnology and gadgets!\nAmrita Ghosh & Arya Mehta\nScience Writers\nKeir Little talks about Harry Potter, US Defense research and the\ncreation of a new frontier of science with Professor Sir John Pendry\nThe magic of metamaterials\nF\nunction through structure\u201d\nis something of a mantra\nfor researchers of\nmetamaterials, a truly\ntwenty-first century field\nwhich aims to create materials with\nbizarre and fascinating optical and\nmagnetic properties, invented here at\nImperial by Professor Sir John Pendry.\n\u201cIt was serendipity, really,\u201d he told\nme. His office is warm and inviting,\na far cry from the laser and steel-filled lab one might expect of the\ninventor of the invisibility cloak. \u201cI\nwas doing consultancy work with the\nMarconi Company in the 90s. They\nwere interested in producing stealth\ncladding for warships which consisted\nof carbon fibres. These worked very\nwell, but they didn\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\u201cThe carbon fibres strongly\nabsorbed in the middle of the typical\nradar frequency band, but in a very\nnarrow range; however, they found\nthat if they spread them very thinly\non paper, it becomes a broad band\nabsorber over nearly the entire radar\nfrequency range, but why?\n\u201cObviously, they were interacting\nwith each other. My first impression\nwas that they were touching, but my\nsecond take was that if you have a wire,\nthere\u2019s a magnetic field associated with\nit that\u2019s inversely proportional to the\nradius. If the wires are very thin, you\nhave a very powerful magnetic field.\nThere\u2019s a magnetic loop connecting\nthe wires, so it\u2019s magnetic induction.\nYou wouldn\u2019t think that, would you,\njust from putting a conductor down?\nThat gave me the idea of function\nthrough structure.\u201d\nMarconi had unwittingly invented\nthe first metamaterial. \u201cThey were so\npleased with that result that they said,\n\u2018go away and do something interesting\nthat you like!\u2019 So I went away, and what\nI did involved a series of structures\nwhose properties were dependent on\nthe structure rather than what they\nwere made of.\u201d\nJohn Pendry\u2019s publication of his\ntheory in 1999 gave rise to the new\ntopic of metamaterials, in which the\nelements or molecules that make\nup the material are secondary to the\narrangement of its larger parts: while\nsome metamaterials are discernible\nonly on the nanoscale, some have\nstructures that are easily visible, like\nmagnetic split-rings.\n\u201cThe next thing was to see if we could\nget some unusual magnetic properties,\nso we devised these little so-called\nsplit rings. They\u2019re about 5mm across.\nIf you put a magnetic field along here,\nthe current tries to go round the loop\nbut can\u2019t because we\u2019ve deliberately\ncut it, but there is some capacitance\nbetween the two loops, so the current\ncan flow through that. What you\u2019ve\ngot with loops with an inductance\nand a gap with capacitance; t\u2019s a little\nresonant circuit. This material has a\nvery peculiar property: it behaves like\nan ordinary magnetic material below\nthe resonant frequency, but if you\ntune the frequency above that, the\nresponse flips, so the applied magnetic\nfield is trying to push one way, and the\nresponse is in the opposite direction!\u201d\nThis was the first step towards one\nof the greatest early breakthroughs\nin the field: materials with a negative\nrefractive index, where light bends\nthe opposite way to normal materials.\nIn 1967, Russian physicist Victor\nVeselago theorised that a substance\nwith both a negative permittivity and\npermeability \u2013 the properties which\ndefine its response to electric and\nmagnetic fields \u2013 would also have a\nnegative refractive index.\n\u201cYou never find this in nature.\u201d\nProfessor Pendry continues, \u201cit was\nthe realisation by my friend and\ncollaborator David Smith in San Diego\nthat with this new metamaterial which\nI announced in 1999, they could make\nin the laboratory a negative refractive\nmaterial. His group made the first;\nthat set off a lot of interest and a lot of\ncontroversy. It also stimulated me to\nthink of what else you could do with\nnegative refraction: if you build a lens\nout of this negative refractory material\nand you do it right \u2013 you have to do it\nexactly right \u2013 then that would break\nthe so-called diffraction limit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain how\ncontroversial these ideas were at the\ntime, people got really upset and I\nreally had to handle some very violent\ncriticism. I think those people would\nhave to agree with me now that\nnegative refraction, sub-wavelength\nresolution is a valid concept.\u201d\nFrom this theory came the perfect\nlens, in which light can be focussed\ndown to points far smaller than its\nwavelength, at the nanometre scale.\nThis could lead to microscopes able\nto directly see large molecules, such\nas DNA. At such scales, the usual\nlaws used to describe light rays break\ndown: \u2018transformation optics\u2019 is the\nname given to manipulating light\nwaves at this level.\n\u201cHave you heard of DARPA?\u201d The\nUSA\u2019s Defense Advanced Research\nProjects Agency is most famous for\ninventing what would later become\nthe Internet. \u201cThey had some\nfunding problem, and invited me to\na meeting. I wanted to show off this\ntransformation optics, so I had to\nthink of something that would surprise\nthem \u2013 that\u2019s how the invisibility cloak\ncame into being. I realised I could use\nthis transformation technique to hide\nan object, and oh boy, did they go wild\non this! I didn\u2019t expect them to take it\nquite as seriously as they did.\u201d\nThe invisibility cloak is what\nProfessor Pendry is most famous for\nin the public eye. \u201cThat led to, largely\ndue to JK Rowling, a huge amount of\npopular interest. I think it was a great\nopportunity to sell science to people:\neverybody knows what light is; thanks\nto Harry Potter, everyone knows what\na cloak is and that it\u2019s something\nmagical. If you say you can make one\nthe public are immediately interested\nand say, \u2018it\u2019s magic! How can that be?!\u2019\nBut you explain to them that it isn\u2019t\nmagic, it\u2019s really just hard science.\u201d\nSmall-scale, single-wavelength\ninvisibility cloaks have been\nmade, but we\u2019re still very far away\nfrom creating one of the Deathly\nHallows. More modest metamaterial\nproducts, however, are already being\nmanufactured. \u201cIt\u2019s a typical trajectory\nin engineering when you have a very\nnew idea: the engineers want to do\nwhat they\u2019re doing already, but just\na little bit better, so they\u2019re making\nlenses which are lighter and focus a bit\nbetter.\u201d\nToyota are funding the development\nof metamaterial lenses to focus\nterahertz rays, which are found in\nthe radars of cars with active cruise\ncontrol systems, and in projects to\nmake self-driving cars. Similar lenses\ncan be used to track the motion of\nsatellites without costly mechanically-moving dishes \u2013 essential for\ntelecommunications in remote areas.\nIn Imperial\u2019s Department of\nElectrical and Electronic engineering,\nProfessor Richard Syms is developing\nmetamaterial-based detectors for\nMRI machines, which allow safe and\ndetailed imaging of the heart and\nbrain.\nProfessor Pendry is keen to point\nout these beneficial areas of research:\n\u201cpeople say it\u2019s all about radar and\nstealth, killing people and so on, but\nit\u2019s not: it\u2019s about safety in cars, and\nhealth. In any place where you can use\nelectromagnetism, you can probably\nfind an application for metamaterials.\u201d\nThe invisibility cloak\nSo far, the most popular application of metamaterials\nbeing worked on is the \u2018invisibility cloak\u2019. This idea was\nfirst proposed by Professor Sir John Pendry. His team\nreceived a grant of \u00a34.9 million to develop metamaterials\nfor \u2018invisibility cloaks\u2019 in 2009.\nThe aim of this cloak is to use metamaterials to grab\nlight and conceal it, therefore making it invisible to the\nhuman eye. This idea is based on the same principle as\nhow water in a river flows around a stick \u2013 in this case\nMetamaterial-enhanced solar cells\nA newly developed layer of tiny Aluminium studs has\nbeen found to enhance the efficiency of solar cells by\nup to 22%.\nThe coating, made up of cylinders just a hundred\nnanometres across, was investigated by scientists\nat Imperial College as part of an international\ncollaboration.\nThey looked at similar structures in gold, silver and\naluminium, to see which could scatter the incident light\nat a high enough angle without absorbing too much\nitself.\nThe scattered light takes a longer path through the\nsolar cell, which can then extract more of its energy.\nThis increase in efficiency looks to make the price\nof solar cells more competitive with fossil fuels in the\nfuture.\n\u201cAs the absorbing material alone can make up half the\ncost of a solar panel our aim has been to reduce to a\nminimum the amount that is needed,\u201d lead author of the\nresearch Dr. Nicholas Hylton said.\nFor thinner solar cells in particular this is good news\nas they are already cheaper than traditional, thicker solar\ncells, but the thinness of their light-absorbing material\nmeans that they are too inefficient to be widely used.\nThis new coating could mean lightweight, flexible\nsolar cells that could power laptops and other everyday\ndevices.\nEmma Wills\nScience Writer\nFrozen rainbows and corkscrew lasers\nProfessor Ortwin Hess speaks to Keir Little about his research\nO\nrtwin Hess is known\nfor the \u2018trapped\nrainbow\u2019 principle,\nbut this is just one\nstep towards his\nexciting vision for metamaterials.\n\u201cIt stops light,\u201d he says about it,\n\u201cso the only thing it can do is \u2018lase\u2019\nenergy off its surface. Why is this\ndifferent to a good old normal laser?\nIt doesn\u2019t have a cavity and is about\na factor of ten thinner. You could\ninclude this in integrated circuits.\u201d\nSuccessful pairing of photonics\nand electronics would have wide\napplications, including a practical way\nof realising quantum computing. \u201cI\nthink the way how one, as a condensed\nmatter physicist, approaches these\nproblems is really quite unique\nas we know we can do something\nspecial with optics because we have\nan understanding of how to arrange\nand change matter. The task is to get\nphotonics down to where electronics\nis, as the wavelength of photons is\naround a factor of a thousand bigger\nthan that of electrons. Photons are\nvery good for communication over\nfibres, but very bad for integration\ninto circuits. We\u2019re aiming to change\nthat.\n\u201cTwo things that go throughout all\nthat I\u2019ve looked at in my academic\ncareer are materials and light. I\nwas first drawn to spatial-temporal\neffects in very small lasers and\nsemiconductors: this was before\nmetamaterials were invented.\u201d\nThe theorisation by John Pendry of\nmaterials with a negative refractive\nindex was the next step in Professor\nHess\u2019s research. \u201cMy way of thinking\nabout these metamaterials was about\nwhat they can do to the speed of\nlight. We looked into controlling the\nspeed of light and saw that under\ncertain conditions, through the\nclever arrangement of the width of\nwaveguides, one can approach states\nwhere the light would need to stop.\nThat realisation led to the trapped\nrainbow principle.\u201d\nIn collaboration with Ullrich\nSteiner\u2019s group at the University\nof Cambridge, Professor Hess\nconsidered a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach to\nmaking metamaterials. By depositing\ngold on a framework of co-polymers,\nthen selectively etching and removing\nthe polymers, a 3D \u2018gyroid\u2019 structure\nwas made which has chirality: it can\ncome in \u2018left-handed\u2019 and \u2018righthanded\u2019 forms.\n\u201cYou have this three-dimensional\nstructure with a chiral property,\nwhich gives us an avenue to generate\nmetamaterials with optical activity,\nwhich means they interact with\npolarised light, something that normal\nmaterials struggle with.\n\u201cHaving manufactured them, the\nexperimentalists investigated them\nand found the very disappointing\nresult that although these have a\nhighly chiral structure, they don\u2019t have\nmuch optical activity.\n\u201cThis is where we theoreticians\ncame on board and were asked to\ndevelop some models. We realised\nthat when wires are helical they have\ndifferent properties than from when\nthey\u2019re straight. This is one of our\nmajor research thrusts at the moment.\nThe aim is to build something that\ndoesn\u2019t exist yet: a laser that emits\ncircularly-polarised light. Can you\nimagine that?\u201d\nLight can be plane polarised,\ncausing all the waves to lie flat in\nthe same direction, or it can be\ncircularly polarised, in which the light\ncorkscrews in a left- or right-handed\ndirection. Circular polarisation is used\nto create the 3D effect at cinemas, but\non the nanoscale could be used to\nprobe the structures of molecules and\nmaterials.\n\u201cAt Imperial we have something\nthat is probably unique worldwide:\nwe can bring together knowledge\non metamaterials and knowledge\non lasers. Normally, the researcher\ncommunities don\u2019t talk or work\ntogether. We\u2019re now combining the\ntwo using gain and active materials.\nThis has huge implications: it opens\nup a whole realm of research. There\u2019s\nno way of controlling light so strongly\nas with a metamaterial.\u201d\nWhat is plasmonics?\nPlasmonics is the the study of free metal electrons which trap light at the\ninterface of a metal and another substance, creating \u2018surface plasmons\u2019.\nThis confines light to an electronic scale, and is the basis on which meta-materials science is built.\nImperial\u2019s Professor Stefan Maier is a researcher in plasmonics and na-nophotonics, who was pivotal in developing the field as a modern science.\n\u201cThe topic is a little older than metamaterials,\u201d he says, \u201cby about one hundred years or so! But it was really revolutionised by the development of\nnanofabrication, so new research in plasmonics began at the end of the\n90s and the turn of the century.\n\u201cI did my PhD at CalTech at that time, which showed that you can make\ntiny waveguides far below the diffraction limit based on surface plasmons.\u201d This discovery was key to enabling the research of many other\nplasmonics and metamaterials scientists.\n\u201cI think the most exciting applications are nanoscale biosensors and\nhighly efficient light sources. If you focus light down to the nanometre\nscale, you can interface it with molecules.\u201d\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\n\n"

Formed from\nthe ashes of mclusky and Jarcrew,\nand now featuring Julia Ruzicka\nfrom Million Dead on bass, they\nare known for their heavy stop-start\nguitar riffs and front man Falco\u2019s\nviciously delivered satirical lyrics.\nI arrive as the first support finishes\nbut catch The Wytches - a fuzzed out\nsurf rock trio from Brighton with lots\nof hair. Catchy, if a bit buzz-bandy. By\nthe time FOTL make it to the stage,\nthe venue is packed. They open with\nolder track \u2018Arming Eritrea\u2019, followed\nby \u2018Small Bones Small Bodies\u2019 from\ntheir first album. Both feature those\npowerful guitar riffs and fist-in-the-air\nshout-along refrains that FOTL do so\nwell. They have successfully woken up\nthe sleepy midweek crowd. On tour\nFuture of the Left at Heaven\nI\nAMS album of the week\nDeath Grips rose to prominence with\nthe 2011 mixtape Exmilitary. This still\nstands to this day as one of my favourite\nhip-hop records. It\u2019s raw, filled with\ncrushing industrial beats and has, in MC\nRide, a very unique rapping style. 2012\nsaw two more albums: The Money Store\nand NO LOVE DEEP WEB, both of which\nI found a bit disappointing, and then shit\nreally hit the fan. NO LOVE DEEP WEB\nwas leaked by the band to bypass the\nrecord label who wanted to delay release\nuntil 2013. This resulted into Death Grips\nbeing dropped and the cover of NO LOVE DEEP WEB being an erect penis with\nthe album name drawn onto it (also available as a t-shirt). Since then it\u2019s got\neven weirder. Their set at Lollapalooza this year was a suicide note being read\nout over feedback, and then they cancelled a tour they hadn\u2019t even announced.\nThe most recent record, Government Plates, was released with little fanfare.\nLuckily, it turns out that in amongst all of the crazy bullshit, Death Grips were\nactually recording a really good album.\nThe crushing industrial beats, viciously shouted rapping and dissonant\nkeyboards all remain. In fact, the main sound is still fairly similar, but the song\nstructures are far more interesting. There\u2019s slightly quieter bits, there\u2019s a few bits\nthat sound a hell of a lot like Nine Inch Nails. The industrial influences seem\nto have progressed to industrial rock in places, rather than the pure noise that\nseemed to dominate earlier releases. Highlights include the schizophrenic Anne\nBonny, the hectic This is Violence Now and the hypnotic, almost tribal, Feels Like\na Wheel. There\u2019s a few tracks that don\u2019t quite hit the spot for me, lead single\nBirds just feels a bit too flat for me and Whatever I Want is a bit too techno for\nmy tastes.\nI always felt like my indifference towards the two 2012 records was due to\nhaving overlistened to Exmilitary and being a bit tired of the whole concept.\nI\u2019m not sure whether my enjoyment of this one is because I\u2019m now ready to\nlisten to Death Grips again, or because it\u2019s actually better. Either way, it\u2019s a really\ngood album. Big fans of Death Grips will almost certainly enjoy it, though I can\u2019t\nimagine this converting anybody who doesn\u2019t like them. For those of you who\nfall in between, this is definitely amongst their better output, and is definitely\nworth your time.\nDeath Grips \u2013 Government Plates\nStuart Masson\nto promote their new crowd-funded\nalbum they play a decent balance of\nnew material to older favourites with\nthe topical \u2018How to Spot a Record\nCompany\u2019 off the new record going\ndown particularly well with the crowd.\nFalco\u2019s scathing wit \u2013 an integral\npart of any FOTL show, seems to be\nslightly subdued tonight. I can forgive\nhim for the recycled \u201chaving to explain\nwhat a keyboard is to a Metallica\nfan\u201d joke since the reason for said\nkeyboard is to play \u2018Manchasm\u2019 \u2013 one\nof my favourite tracks from the first\nrecord. It finishes with a wonderful\nshout-along \u2018round\u2019 about Colin \u2013 a\nvery pretty pussycat. And that is what\nmakes FOTL so immensely enjoyable\nlive: they may, at heart, be an angry\nnoise-rock vehicle for Falco to spew\nhis darkly amusing bile into the world,\nbut they combine it with catchy\nkeyboards, great guitar riffs, and yes,\neven vocal harmonies and rounds!\nThey treat us to some\nold mclusky tracks.\nNo surprises there.\n\u2018To Hell with Good\nIntentions\u2019 seems to be\ntheir go-to fan-pleaser,\nbut it hardly seems\nnecessary since they\nare doing a great job\nof it so far (I confess,\nI still sang along to\nevery word). FOTL\nhave managed that\nrare thing: they have\nsuccessfully stepped\nout of the shadow of\ntheir former beloved\ncult band. Rarer still,\nfour albums in and\nthey show no signs of\nlosing their edge. They\nhave more than proved\nit tonight \u2013 filling\nHeaven to capacity on a Wednesday.\nEvery track they play is a winner.\nThey build to a spectacularly\nscathing and surreal finish. Out comes\nnew track \u2018Singing of the Bonesaws\u2019.\nFalco preaches to the crowd in\nRecieved Pronunciation English over\nthis bare-bones track about how we\nmay be confusing our feelings of\nexcitement with the fear of missing\nout. They blend this into an intense\nmash-up of \u2018Lapsed Catholics\u2019 and\nmclusky\u2019s raw and dirty \u2018Lightsabre\nCocksucking Blues\u2019, speeding up on\neach successive verse until Falco is\njust screaming nonsense and sending\nthe crowd into a frenzy. As Falco\nbegins dismantling Jack Egglestone\u2019s\ndrum kit while he and Ruzicka are\nstill playing, guitarist Watkins climbs\nthe scaffolding above the crowd to\nfeed them with chorizo tied to a stick.\nAll very exciting for a Wednesday\nnight; I certainly didn\u2019t miss out.\nClemy Walker reports on the Welsh rockers\nsmerine are one of the\nmore loosely-related\nGodspeed You! Black\nEmperor side projects.\nIt features Bruce Cawdron, the drummer from GY!BE (he\nalso plays in Set Fire to Flames),\nalongside cellist Beckie Foon, who\nplays with both Set Fire to Flames,\nHRSTA and A Silver Mt. Zion (all\nother Godspeed side projects, keeping up?). Probably due to the members\u2019 other bands, they\u2019re frequently\nlabelled as a post-rock band. However,\nto my ears this owes much more to\nchamber music than it does post-rock\ntraditions. It\u2019s a far cry from Godspeed, but it\u2019s still a fascinating listen.\nOpening track \u2018Learning to Crawl\u2019\ncomes from a fairly basic modern\nclassical direction, but it\u2019s really\nbeautiful and works great as an\nopeningtrack.\u2018LostRiverBlues\u2019IandII\nexplore Arabic musical traditions over\na background of ambient and more\nupbeat modern classical respectively\nto moderate success. \u2018Barn Board\nFire\u2019 is probably the closest thing to a\npost-rock track on the album, but it\u2019s\nlaced with heavy folk rhythms, and it\u2019s\nabsolutely fantastic. \u2018Hayale Dalmak\u2019\nis a fairly ambient track, but it fits in\nnicely. \u2018Translator\u2019s Clos\u2019 I and II are a\nbit more upbeat, and they really don\u2019t\ndo it for\nme. \u2018White\nPine\u2019 on the\nother hand,\nis a really\nlovely track,\nagain from\na more basic\nm o d e r n\nc l a s s i c a l\nd i r e c t i o n\nand \u2018Yavri\nY a v r i \u2019\ncloses the\nalbum with\na n o t h e r\nreally nice\na m b i e n t\npiece with a\nfew strings\nover it.\nThis is an\nalbum of\nLumina Kemp\nEmserine \u2013 Dalmak\nStuart Masson\nMusic Editor\nE\ninconsistent styles, but it all meshes\ntogether fairly well.

Held in Dagenham, East London,\nthis competition saw 36 of the best\nteams in the South East compete for\na top-six finish, and with it, a place at\nthe National finals.\nUniversity-level Ultimate is played\non two surfaces: outdoors, on large\ngrass pitches, and indoors, played on\nhardwood basketball courts. It is also\nplayed across three divisions: open\n(where anyone is eligible to play),\nwomen\u2019s (exclusively for females)\nand mixed (with an even gender split\nacross the team). With Open Indoor\nRegionals hosting such a depth of\nteams, qualification for Nationals was\nnever going to be easy.\nStarting on Saturday seeded fifth,\nImperial College Ultimate needed to\ncome out hard to fight their way up the\nrankings. The first group-stage match\nwas drawn against Portsmouth II, and\nit soon became apparent that these\nwere to be the group whipping-boys.\nA relatively nonchalant performance\nsaw Imperial gain easy turnovers,\nforce simple errors and eventually\nreach the maximum points cap in\nless than twenty minutes, winning the\ngame 13-0.\nThe next game pitted Imperial\nagainst King\u2019s College; the teams not\nonly share the training ground in\nHyde Park, but also a friendly local\nrivalry. Imperial stepped up their\ngame against this stronger opposition\nand, even during several long points,\nplayed impressive shut-down defence\nto deny several scoring opportunities.\nMeanwhile on offense, Imperial\nplayed it cool, taking the chances they\nwere given to extend a comfortable\nlead, eventually winning 9-2 and\nsetting up a pivotal final group game.\nThe University of Sussex are the\ndominant force in the South East,\nwinning several National titles\nacross all divisions in recent years.\nTestament to their strength was their\nsecond team, featuring cameos from\nseveral of their first-team players,\nwho were also unbeaten thus far in\nthe competition. The group-deciding\ngame saw Imperial trailing 3-1 after\ngiving up some cheap long goals, but\novercoming their nerves and finding\ntheir feet the London team battled\nback and overturned the deficit to level\nthe scoreline. With the momentum\nbehind them, Imperial forced errors\nfrom the Sussex side who now could\nnot handle Imperial\u2019s offense. With\ntime running out and with the disc in\ntheir hands, Imperial soaked up the\npressure to win the game, and with it\nthe pool.\nBy beating their second team,\nImperial earned a semi-final matchup\nagainst Sussex I to start their Sunday.\nFacing a team unbeaten in the region\nfor several years was an intimidating\nprospect, but Imperial began the\nmatch on an equal footing, trading\nscores. Both teams forced throwaways\nand both teams got blocks, and with\nthe game staying tight play became\nmore and more intense. The toughest\nmatch of the tournament for both\nteams, late in the game Sussex forced\nan error from the Imperial side and,\nalready in the lead, scored the goal to\nextend their lead to two points. Out\nof time and out of luck, Imperial had\ntheir first competitive defeat of the\nseason.\nUpset at the loss but still proud\nof the performance, there was still\neverything to play for: Imperial could\nstill end the weekend ranked second.\nPitted against the other beaten semi-finalist, Portsmouth I, Imperial\u2019s\ndefensive strength was crucial \u2013\nlocking down the opposition, the\nLondon side played the disc through\nthe team to score a number of crisp\ngoals. Portsmouth, who looked strong\nearly in the match, began to capitulate\nand failed to threaten the endzone,\nwith Imperial seeing out the game in\nrelative ease.\nWinning meant Imperial faced up\nagainst Surrey, the beaten finalist.\nOver recent years the two teams have\nmet at crucial points in tournaments\nand a strong rivalry has emerged,\nwhich incentivised an Imperial victory\neven more. An athletic side, Surrey\nlooked promising in the early stages\nof the match, but the experienced\nImperial team was up to the challenge\nand denied a number of Surrey\u2019s\nattempted scoring passes. On offense,\nImperial kept calm despite significant\npressure at the end of a hard weekend,\nworking the disc well and being\nrewarded with some confident scores.\nDespite the closeness of play, the\nscoreline painted a very different\npicture: a 7-4 victory for Imperial.\nBeaten only by the eventual\nwinners, Imperial secured second\nplace \u2013 their highest ever finish at a\nRegional competition \u2013 and a spot at\nthe prestigious Division 1 Nationals\nwith fifteen of the top-ranked\nuniversity teams from around the\nUK. The second team also finished\nvery strongly, finishing 13th and\nhigher than five university first teams,\nwhich bodes very well for many of the\nteam who were playing in their first\ncompetitive tournament.\nMeanwhile the third team finished\n25th, earning silverware for topping\ntheir bracket of the tournament and\ncapping a very successful weekend for\nImperial College Ultimate.\nUltimate is still welcoming new\nplayers \u2013 if you are interested in\nplaying, regardless of experience,\ncome along to our training sessions\nin Hyde Park on Wednesdays (13.00-15.00) and Saturdays (12.00-14.00)\nor email ultimate@imperial.ac.uk for\nmore information.\nImmortals\nroyally Rumble\nRegents\nThe Imperial Immortals returned to\nHarlington to take on their old rivals,\nthe KCL Regents, in their third\nmatch of the season. However, there\nwas more on the line than league\npositions, as the teams were playing\nfor the London Bowl. Coming off the\nback of wins against Greenwich and\nWestminster, the Immortals were\nlooking to continue their winning\nways.\nIt was a cold Sunday Afternoon\nwhen the match kicked off. The\nImmortals\u2019 special teams unit was\nonce again fired up, looking to\nmaintain the good work they put\nin against the Greenwich Mariners,\nand sprinted down field to tackle the\nRegents returner.\nThe home defence then took the\nfield. So far this season no team had\nscored against the Immortals and\nthey were looking to hold onto this\nrecord. The Regents\u2019 offence could\nnot break through the big hitting\ndefence and were forced to punt the\nball on their fourth down.\nThe offence then took the field,\nbig runs from Emanuel Olagbaju\nand Duncan Mackinnon pushed\nthe Regents\u2019 defence back. The\nImmortals pass game, which had\npreviously struggled this season,\nbegan to come together with Toby\nSinclair finding Henry Badham with\na deep ball. However, the defence\nwas not giving in easily, and stopped\nthe Immortals getting into the end\nzone.\nThe game continued in a similar\nfashion, but big plays came in the\nsecond quarter. Alex Hutchinson\nleapt to intercept a deep pass from\nthe Regents\u2019 quarterback, but the\noffence failed to score from the\nadvantageous field position. The\nhome defence then put in another\nbig effort and the Immortals\u2019 offence\nwere ready to take the field again. A\nhard-hitting run game pushed the\nImmortals deep into the Regents\u2019\nhalf. A quick pass threaded from\nToby to Tino Millar, who had beaten\nhis defender for pace, provided the\nfirst touchdown. After a failed PAT\nattempt, the score stood at 6-0.\nThescorestoodgoingintohalftime,\nbut the Immortals were ahead they\nknew that the small mistakes they\nwere making on both sides of the\nball could lead to them losing their\ncurrent unbeaten record. The half\nbegan with the Regents kicking the\nball deep to Tino, who raced behind\nthe wedge and managed to make it\nto the 40-yard line.\nThe highlights of the third quarter\nwere Duncan\u2019s hard running and\nspin moves and Tino grabbing a deep\npass from Toby. It was not long until\nthe Immortals scored again. The\noffensive line created a big pocket for\nToby who had time to pick a pass to\nHenry, who ran in for a touchdown.\nThe PAT attempt was converted by\nDuncan diving across the goal line\nincreasing the score to 14-0.\nThe third quarter came to a\nclose, and after a long break due\nto injury, the Immortals defence\ntook the field to stop a Regents\ndrive. The away offence took the\nfield looking determined to score.\nThey continued to punch the ball\ntowards the Immortals\u2019 goal line and\neventually ran in for a touchdown,\nbecoming the first team to score on\nthe Immortals this season.\nWith the score at 14-6 and less\nthan a quarter to go, the Immortals\nknew that they had to keep the ball\nand run down the clock. After a\nbig drive down the field, with both\npass and run plays picking apart\nthe Regents\u2019 defence, the away team\nwere forced to take a timeout with\nninety seconds remaining.\nThe Immortals\u2019 offensive coaches\ndiscussed the situation and decided\nit was time to use the reverse play.\nThe fake was made to the halfback,\nand then Tino took the handoff\nfrom Toby. The defence took the\nbait and Tino had an easy run in for\nhis second touchdown of the day.\nEmmanuel then scored the PAT\nattempt, diving through a large gap\ncreated by the offensive line.\nWith that the game was over,\nthe final score being 22-6. The\nImmortals had retained the London\nBowl and continued their impressive\nwinning streak, which now stands\nat three games, placing them top of\ntheir conference. Man of the match\nawards when to Alex Hutchinson,\nDexter Valencia, Emanuel Olagbaju\nand Anuj Baid. The overall MVP\naward went to Tino Millar for his\nhard work on both offence and\nspecial teams.\nThe Immortals next face the Royal\nHolloway Bears at Harlington on\nDecember 1st. Kick off is at 12 and\nall are welcome to come and support.\nHarry Badham reports as IC\nwin London Bowl and preserve\nunbeaten record\nAussies strike\nsignificant\npsychological\nblow\nKunal Wagle\nSports Editor\nIn last week\u2019s column I said that, despite the 3-0 scoreline, Australia troubled England in the summer, and that\nEngland would need to be wary if they\nwanted to retain the Ashes for the\nfourth consecutive time (for the first\ntime ever). In the Brisbane test the\nAustralian team produced a performance beyond their wildest dreams\n(and those of most of their supporters)\nto take a 1-0 lead in the series and win\ntheir first game since January.\nThere are some worrying points\nfor England, beyond going behind in\nthe series itself. The first is the nature of the loss. The Australians look\nup to the task and fired up \u2013 Michael\nClarke\u2019s comments that James Anderson should \u201cget ready for a fucking broken arm\u201d prove this. This victory would only have given them more\nconfidence, especially the large margin of victory.\nLast week in Felix I wrote that England\u2019s batting looked in good shape\nduring the warm up games, with\nAlistair Cook and Michael Carberry\nlooking particularly strong. However\nthe top order\u2019s strong performance\nmay have had its disadvantages as the\nmiddle order looked under-cooked,\nwith Kevin Pietersen\u2019s second innings\ndismissal summing up England\u2019s per-formance. The two-day practice game\nbefore the Adelaide test is now crucial\nfor them to get some practice in the\nmiddle.\nOne positive for England is that\nthe bowlers produced a reasonable\nperformance in the first innings, dismissing Australia for what looked like\na meagre total (293). They may want\nto reconsider selecting Chris Tremlett\nahead of Steven Finn. They might also\nwant to further bolster their attack by\nadding all rounder Ben Stokes in place\nof Jonathan Trott, who has returned\nhome with a stress-related illness.\nPerhaps the most worrying factor is\nnot only that Michael Clarke returned\nto form with a hundred, but that David Warner and Brad Haddin also\nsupported ably \u2013 something that was\nabsent in the summer.\nAdelaide is a must win game for\nEngland now, as they can\u2019t go to Perth\n\u2013 a bouncy pitch where Australia will\nprobably be favourites \u2013 2-0 down. In\nterms of ability, England should still\nwin this. But Australia have struck a\nsignificant psychological blow \u2013 one\nthat may prove decisive.\nThe Ashes Column\nPremier League\nPredictions\nJames White\nFootball Columnist\nTottenham v Man United\n(Sunday 12pm, Sky Sports 1)\nAndre-Villas Boas needs to go back to\nthe drawing board after humiliation at\nthe Etihad last weekend. Spurs have\nheld a very defensive line all season,\neven though AVB has the attacking\nresources to play much more offen-sively. He needs to take some risks but\nis unlikely to change his tactics when\nthe champions come a-calling. It\u2019s\ngreat to see Wayne Rooney firing on\nall cylinders again, and United were\nunlucky to only draw at Cardiff. This is\na great opportunity for David Moyes\nto silence more doubters and build on\nthe Red Devils\u2019 strong record at White\nHart Lane.\nPrediction: 0-2\nHull v Liverpool\n(Sunday 2:05pm, Sky Sports 1)\nSteve Bruce will have been extremely\ndisappointed that Hull lost their unbeaten home record to rock bottom\nCrystal Palace last weekend, and\nwith an extra man. For the first time\nthis season, they looked vulnerable\nand disorganised. Their centre halves\ncould be chasing shadows on Sunday\nas Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez\nare capable of running rings around\nthem. The Reds came as close as any\nteam has to ending Everton\u2019s unbeaten home record for 2013 in last\nweekend\u2019s thrilling Merseyside derby.\nHull don\u2019t score many so the Reds will\nrightly be strong favourites.\nPrediction: 0-2\nChelsea v Southampton\n(Sunday 4:10pm, Sky Sports 1)\nBoth sides will be bang up for this.\nChelsea\u2019s big win at West Ham was\nonly their second win away from\nStamford Bridge all season and Jos\u00e9\nMourinho says he now wants his side\nto embark on a winning run in the\nbusy run-up to Christmas. They have\na kind set of fixtures to come and, with\nall their players fit, they could soon\nseize pole position. But the Saints are\nno pushovers and Mauricio Pochettino will have been disappointed that\nthey laid down with a whimper after an Artur Boruc howler gifted the\nGunners a lead last weekend. Expect\nan impassioned contest but the Blues\u2019\nclass should prevail.\nPrediction: 3-1\nNewcastle v West Brom\n(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nBoth these teams are entertaining\nto watch because their attackers link\nup well and understand each other\u2019s\ngames. Steve Clarke likes to go for it\naway too \u2013 this could be a Desmond.\nPrediction: 2-2\nBest of the rest\n(Saturday 3pm unless stated)\nAston Villa v Sunderland\nVilla showed a lot of determination to\ncome from 2-0 down to draw at West\nBrom on Monday. Gus Poyet\u2019s Black\nCats were luckless at Stoke and do not\ntravel well so anything here will be a\nbonus.\nPrediction: 2-1\nCardiff v Arsenal\nThe Bluebirds are fast making a habit\nof seeing off the league\u2019s big guns on\ntheir home patch. But Arsenal have\nbeen an entirely different kettle of fish\nthis season and should extend their\nlead at the summit here.\nPrediction: 1-2\nNorwich v Crystal Palace\nTony Pulis will recognise Palace\u2019s win\nHAMISH BLAIR / GETTY IMAGES\nPA PHOTOS\nIC Judo produce\nstunning performance\nin London Open\nAndres Olivares gives his account\nJudo players from around the UK\ndescended on the University of East\nLondon to compete in a tournament\nof titanic proportions. The main Imperial College contingent left from\nSouth Kensington at 6.30am so as to\nmake it in time for weigh-ins, a tedious but necessary part of any Judo\ntournament. First up to compete were\nthe women, and they did not disap-point. Suzie Lednarova won gold in\nthe under 70kg black belt division,\nbuzz-sawing through all competition\nwith none of her matches going the\nfull 5 minutes on her way. Renata Picciotto pulled off a stunner, winning\nthe novice to green belt under 52kg\ndivision which included women with\nmuch more than her month or so of\nJudo experience, as well as competing\nin the weight class above. Ex-captain\nand former Imperial student Alice\nMitchell managed to get a bronze in\nthe womens under 57kg. We were\nthen treated to a groundwork clinic by\nour young Brazilian jiu-jitsu phenomenon Nour Kelfi, who won the bronze\nin his division. The next category to\ncompete were the under 60 kg men\u2019s\nblack belts, famed for their speed, car-dio and unrelenting pace. They did not\ndisappoint, with our very own cap-tain, Andres Olivares del Campo who,\nleading by example, ran through the\nopposition, as if they were like many\nuneaten bowls of tapas, scoring several devastating Ippons (Judo\u2019s equivalent of the knockout, which is scored\nby throwing an opponent flat on his\nback) and my personal favourite for\nits unexpectedness \u2013 a twisting arm\nlock out of thin air when his opponent\nwas stalling on his back, which had his\nopponent tapping in seconds. Straight\nafter this were the under 66 kg black\nbelts, a large, talent-filled division that\nhad no fewer than 3 Imperial Judokas.\nThis division was equally exciting to\nbehold, and Etienne Wilbaux snapped\nup a well-deserved Bronze medal. The\nhighlight was the tense and well contested final won by Jo\u00e3o Pela. Neither\nof the competitors could make any\nheadway and the contest seemed sure\nto head into extra time when Jo\u00e3o unleashed his secret weapon, an unorthodox switch to a southpaw stance\nfollowed by a spectacular throw, which\ncatapulted his opponent gracefully\ninto the air before landing him rather\nless gracefully on his back for the Ippon and a well deserved first tournament win. Next on the mat was Juuso\nTerava aka \u2018The Iceman\u2019 or \u2018The Finnisher\u2019, for both his ice cool demeanour\nunder pressure and his scintillating\nJudo, which often leaves competitors\nquivering in fear. He showed clinical\nJudo to earn himself a bronze in the\nunder 90kg black belt division. The\nfinal two medal winners were in the\nheavy weight division \u2013 Chris Holdsworth-Swan, the Judo club\u2019s social sec\nand newly minted brown-belt (with an\nuncanny resemblance to Hagrid from\nHarry Potter), secured the silver medal in his first soir\u00e9e into black belt level\ncompetition, with Chong Swee Hang\nsecuring the bronze.\nIn the team competition Imperial\nCollege came second to Nottingham\nUniversity, only narrowly missing out\non the trophy by two points. There\nwas a great team spirit on show from\neveryone, with people watching and\ncheering on our competitors, and the\nmore experienced Judokas were able\nto provide tips and corner advice,\nwhich really made the difference to\neveryone. Special thanks must go to\nGlenn Spiers, our coach who gave up\nhis Sunday, despite being ill, to coach\nand support the team. His mat-side\ncoaching and encouragement was\ncrucial to the success of all of our\ncompeting athletes.\nIC JUDO\nat Hull was smash-and-grab and it will\ntake time for him to impose his own\nstyle, but he inherits a spirited side capable of pushing a struggling Canaries\noutfit right to the wire.\nPrediction: 1-1\nWest Ham v Fulham\nNeither of these sides can buy a goal\nright now and both Sam Allardyce and\nMartin Jol will both fear for their fu-tures. This could turn out to be a relegation six pointer but who is going to\nfind the net?\nPrediction: 0-0\nMan City v Swansea\nSwansea badly needed their win at\nFulham last weekend to restore confidence in the camp. Unfortunately\nfor them, Man City are indomitable\nat home. Their strikeforce is just irresistible and they could rack up a few\ncricket scores at the Etihad this year\nPrediction: 3-0\nEverton v Stoke\nMark Hughes was a relieved man after the Potters finally won versus Sunderland but they are not suited to the\npassing style he is trying to impose.\nThey will be tough to break down but\nthe Toffees have the flair players to\nwin the midfield battle at Goodison\nPark.\nPrediction: 2-0\nSHAUN BOTTERILL / GETTY IMAGES\n\n"

There was even time for a song\nfor birthday boy Ed Hallet, whose present was a rather skimpy size 6 vest to\nwear in the race. The scenic route did\nlimit time to arrive at the start though.\nBut, following a brisk march led by the\ncaptain yielding the club vuvuzela in\nthe air, and a precarious bag drop at\nthe alumni\u2019s car the team made it to\nthe start line with barely any time to\nspare!\nOver 2,000 runners took part in the\nevent, but despite this the club had\ntop 25 finishers in both the men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s races. Returning from inju-ry, Chris Bannon acted as pacemaker\nfor the term\u2019s star male athlete Liam\nSmith, with both runners staying side\nby side until the last km with Bannon going to finish in 33.17 (21st) and\nSmith in 33.25 (22nd), a huge personal best for Liam. Some say that Liam\nowes Chris many drinks for the rest of\nthe year\u2026 James Ellis also joined the\npaced train for the first 4km and held\non to run 34.55, a huge personal best.\nJust behind, Milan Misak ripped up\nthe form book with one of the team\u2019s\nmost animalistic runs of the day with\n35.39, more than 4 minutes off his\nprevious best.\nHe just held off Charlie Houston\n(35.45) who had the better of club secretary Matt Douthwaite (36.18) and\nClement Jambou (36.20).\nIn the women\u2019s race, the club\u2019s stellar summer signing Imo Simmonds\nonce again impressed running 38.58\nto take 12th in the women\u2019s race,\nwhich would have made the top 200\nin the men\u2019s race! This followed a 4th\nplace in the London Colleges League\nearlier in the week, the best result by\nan Imperial lady for 4 years! She led\nback Sophie Kirk (42.40) and Imogen\nKeane (43.29), showing that Imogen\nproves to be a fast name in ICXC!\nSarah Twaite and Barbara Hollinger\nwere next making impressive club debuts with 46.33 and 46.35 with Antoinette Hardijzer also taking a PB with\n47.42.\nAfter the race, there was the necessary pose for a seafront photo, consumption of club baking and a trip\nto a local fish and chips restaurant.\nSome of the group then headed back,\nbut other continued visiting some\nof Brighton\u2019s watering holes, before\nstocking up on some essentials before\nthe early evening banter train back to\nVictoria.\nAltogether it proved to be a Super\nSunday for the club, with a terrific\nturnout, personal best performances\nand some serious socialising.\nOnwards to Stirling for BUCS championships in February!\nINSIDE\nJudo produce stunning performance in London Open\nBUCS\nHome\nFixtures\n4th December 2013\nBADMINTON\nmens 3rd (medics) vs brighton\nwomens 2nd (medics) vs\nwomens 1st\nmens 1st vs portsmouth\nbasketball\nwomens 1st vs chichester\nfootball\nmens 1st vs canterbury\nmens 2nd (medics) vs\ncanterbury\nmens 4th vs westminster\nhockey\nmens 5th vs surrey\nwomens 5th (medics) vs lse\nwomens 2nd (medics) vs\nwomens 1st\nmens 1st vs kcl\nmens 6th (medics) vs sussex\nmens 7th vs royal holloway\nlacrosse\nwomens 1st vs brighton\nnetball\nwomens 5th (medics) vs kcl\nwomens 7th (medics) vs\nroehampton\nwomens 4th vs kcl\nwomens 6th vs royal holloway\nrugby union\nmens 3rd vs ucl\nsquash\nmens 2nd vs lse\ntable tennis\nwomens 1st vs lse\nMens 1st vs east anglia\ntennis\nwomens 2nd vs brunel\nmens 1st vs kent\nChris Bannon reports from the\nseaside\nThe Imperial Cross Country team pose triumphantly by the coast in Brighton.\nIC CROSS COUNTRY\nT\nhe Imperial Eagles\nHandball Club could\ncelebrate a double\nvictory over the newly\nformed Kings College\nCobras Handball club, with both\nthe women\u2019s and the men\u2019s team\ncoming up trumps last Sunday.\nThe women\u2019s team was playing their first game of the season\nin Barking on Sunday, but a late\ncancellation forced them to compensate and improvise a great deal\nif they wanted to defeat Kings College on the day. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a\ngreat deal of depth this season, but\nstarting a game with one player\nless is something that we wanted\nto avoid at all cost.\u201d said Natalia\nCouto Francisco, team captain of\nthe women\u2019s squad. \u201cOn the other\nhand, it really focused our minds\nand helped us to ensure we use\nevery spell of possession to the\nbest of our abilities!\u201d She laughed\nafter the encounter.\nIn the first 20 minutes, Kings\nCollege tried hard to demoralise\nthe Eagles and get plenty of goals\nbetween the teams. However, Imperial never looked likely to let\nthat happen and cleverly shifted\ntheir defense in order to adapt\nto their opponents\u2019 shooters in\nthe centre positions. A necessary\nconsequence of this was that the\nattackers on the wing would find\nthemselves with more space, but\nthe Cobras struggled to capitalise\non the space and numerical advan-tage.\nIn attack, Imperial\u2019s women\nplayed their waves effectively and\nwithout conceding many turno-vers, which helped them create opportunities to take promising shots\non goal. The Cobra\u2019s goalkeeper\nand her unusual technique proved\ndifficult to overcome, but by the interval the score was 5:12 in favour\nof Imperial.\nIn the second half, the Cobras\u2019\ndefense tried to disrupt the Eagles\u2019 attack by marking their centre\nplayer. After an initial success and\nreducing the deficit by 2 goals, Imperial\u2019s women\u2019s team shifted their\nplay onto the wing and continued\ntheir fine scoring run. Throughout\nthe second 30 minutes of the match,\nthe leaders managed to hold on to\ntheir advantage and secured their\nfirst victory with a goal difference of\n+8.\nEarlier that day, the Imperial Eagles men\u2019s team had to face the Cobras in Kings\u2019 first ever competitive\ngame. Imperial have learned to not\nunderestimate new teams after their\nclose encounter with Royal Holloway 2 weeks previously and started\nwith a strong team. Due to a low\nturnout, Kings was allowed to add\nsome girls players on the bench in\norder to support their starting seven\nand increase their depth. In the first\n15 minutes, the Cobras struggled\nto trouble the Eagles\u2019 defense and\nonly two careless moments by Stefan Bauer spared them the embarrassment of ending a half without\nhaving scored. On the other side of\nthe court, the inexperienced Cobras\nshowed a lot of will and spirit and\ntried stay on top of their opponents,\nbut Imperials unique mixture of fast\ncounter-attacks, skillfully crafted\nschemes like \u201cWurst\u201d and \u201cHeidi\u201d,\nand their individual brilliance meant\nthat Kings would find themselves\ntrailing by 25:2 at half time. All hope\nfor the second half was lost when the\nKings College goalkeeper was red-carded for flooring Imperials Ruben\nFreytag in the middle of a counterattack a few minutes before the in-terval. After a partially sloppy display by Imperial in the second half,\nthey came away with a 42:10 victory.\nClub president Rishi De-Kayne,\nwho was unable to attend either fix-ture, was rumored to have danced in\ncelebration upon hearing the excellent news. He later said that \u201cI am so\nhappy for both teams, but especially\nthe girls\u2019! To win the first game of the\nseason despite being a player short is\na remarkable achievement.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s clashes see the girls\nbattle it out against UCL, who are\nfavourites for the league title this\nyears, and the men\u2019s team is set to\nplay Brunel University, who put in\nan impressive performance against\nMiddlesex University on the opening day of the season.\nStefan Bauer describes the action as\nIC complete the double over KCL\n\n"

Various other sizes available.\nA joint venture between a musician/designer and an artist/\nphotographer - in short, two creative folk. David Balfour and\nHannah Scott specialize in loose leaf tea from around the world.\nFrom the staple English Breakfast to some more-exotic Oolong from\nChina, to sumptuous caffeine-free blends of rooibos and other\nherbal teas, Tea Studio has such a wide variety to pick from - there\u2019s\nsomething for every tea connosieur out there.\nWhat we think makes them stand out is the highly visual aspect of\ntheir products - everything from the tea itself (in its loose, \u201ccome\nhither and brew\u201d state) to the packaging (done in collaboration\nwith other artists and designers) is impeccable and pleasing to the\neye. Think Whittards with a lot more understated yet artsy flair - the\ntea looks great both in and out of its packaging! (Okay, we\u2019re sure\nthere\u2019s an innuendo in here somewhere...)\nBut it\u2019s not all flash, the blends are wonderfully aromatic and\nuplifting. And of course, they taste heavenly. They\u2019ve also got\nsubstance; a good number of their products have won some gongs\nin the Guild of Fine Food\u2019s Great Taste Awards 2013. We could go\non, but as the proof\u2019s in the tasting you might as well go and sample\nthem yourself! Samples are cheap on the internet and they last a\ngood few cuppas.\nFelix Loves: Everything (it all looked and smelt good on\nthe stand), but our star pick is the Camomile/Chamomile\n(caffeine free) at GBP4.00/50g. It\u2019s whole head chamomile\nblossoms, not the sneeze dust wrapped up in teabags you can\nprocure from aisle-number-whatever in Sainsbo\u2019s. Honey buttery\nnotes aplenty (without the bitterness that plagues most chamomile\ninfusions), it\u2019s the perfect calming/sleep aid (not like we require\nsleep aids here at Imperial, do we...)\nAlso try: Reindeer Rooibos (seasonal), Peppermint,\nSuperfruit (not available online - try contacting them!)\nA Taste of Christmas (2013)\nWe get taken into custardy by the myriad of goodies on offer\nNow in its ninth year, the Taste\nFestivals cohort show no signs of\nslowing down or giving up any time\nsoon. Taste Festivals are annual\naffairs that take place in at least 12\ncities around the world, from Bath to\nMelbourne to Cape Town. In London,\nthey run two events a year: Taste\nof London, the flagship event that\nstarted it all, happens in the summer,\nwhereas Taste of Christmas more\naptly takes place a few weeks before -er, Christmas.\nHaving been introduced to the\nTaste of Christmas festival a year\nago by a former Felix Games editor\n- and thoroughly enjoying it - we\nsaw no reason to miss out this year.\nEspecially since the festival moved\nto the beautiful spacious Tobacco\nDock this year, and with a bevy of free\nmasterclasses and demonstrations\n(amongst other things) on offer -hosted by a star-studded lineup that\nincluded Eric Lanlard, Gizzi Erskine\nand Michel Roux Jr - who were we\nto say no? Even if Tobacco Dock\nwas quite a trek away from typical\nImperialite haunts (put it this way - we\nsaw what the DLR looked like for the\nfirst time!)\nOf note was the Intel Baking Theatre\n- if you were lucky enough to get in\nline for a free slot, you got to indulge\nin a baking masterclass where chefs\nwould demonstrate in front, and you\u2019d\nfollow along with an Intel-powered\ntablet on your station that showed you\nprocedures and tips as the instructor\nwent on. It\u2019s meant to be both digitally\nand personally interactive, and it sure\nlooked so. Naturally all the slots were\nbooked out due to its novelty value;\nbut from what we could see from\nthe sidelines many were enthralled\nby it. We can\u2019t imagine messy cooks\nwill take too well to the idea though;\nleaving cupcake batter smears all over\ntouchscreen displays probably isn\u2019t\nthe best thing!\nBut the bulk of this festival\u2019s\nattraction really lies with the various\nsmall (and not-so-small) artisan\nproducers who were present and\nexhibiting their wares, alongside\nrestaurants who had pop-ups on\nthe day to cater to hungry tummies.\nHaving moved to their new venue\nfrom dingy ol\u2019 ExCeL last year, there\u2019s\nplenty more space to accommodate\nnew producers on show. (In fact when\nwe went, part of the LG floor was\nunused! More next year maybe?)\nAnyway - there were many star\nproducts on the day; if we tried to\nwax lyrical on all of them here we\u2019d\nprobably need a full issue of Felix on\nour own. We\u2019ve painstakingly whittled\nour picks down to the top one or two\nin each category - we\u2019re not saying\nby any means that you HAVE to give\nthese guys a go; but they\u2019re amazing.\nDisclaimer: While Felix Food received\ncomplimentary tickets to the event, all\npurchases and opinions on the exhibits\nare our own - we\u2019re not paid for them.\nAnd just as well - support artisans!\nTaste of Christmas, cheesy no? Stop w(h)ining about the weather and mulling over your troubles!\nTHE FELIX GUIDE TO VISITING FOOD FESTIVALS\nWe totally realize that they\u2019re not all one size fits all (they\u2019re all\nstructured rather differently), and that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re not saying\nthat this guide is a hard and fast set of rules to follow; however,\nif you\u2019re a food festival rookie/virgin, you might find this helpful\nso you don\u2019t get \u201cdeer in headlights\u201d syndrome when you arrive.\nAfter all, it\u2019s hard to see sense and know where to start when\nthere\u2019s a myriad of mouth-watering fare on offer right in front of\nyou...don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a valid excuse.\nGETTING THERE// In the winter, the bigger indoor food festivals\ntend to take place in the East London exhibition centres due to\nspace constraints with the West London venues. For the love of\ncrumble, figure out transport beforehand. Especially if your route\ninvolves using the Overground/national train services, which can\nbe sporadic.\nSAMPLING ETIQUETTE// Just because you sample some wares\ndoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obliged to buy what you\u2019ve just tried, so\ndon\u2019t guilt yourself into HAVING to buy everything and be out of\npocket. Then again, don\u2019t just. gobble and ditch your way around\nthe festival - that\u2019s greedy and rude. We find making small talk\nwith the people on the stand fun; you get to know the stories\nbehind their companies and products (some of which are rather\nserendiptious and funny!) Remember, they\u2019re people too - you\u2019re\nnot buying from a faceless big-name party.\nMASTERCLASSES/WORKSHOPS// Probably the most fun\npart! Please, please read and plan ahead if you know one of your\nculinary idols is hosting a session and you want to be part of it.\nWhile most tend to be free, some can cost - so check to make sure\nyou won\u2019t be caught out. Other than that, you\u2019ll need to sign up\nfor them on the day - so check times and go early to register for a\ngood hands-on view/experience!\nCHEESE\nBlue Monday, Alex James Presents.\nGBP18/kilo\nAvailable at Whole Foods Kensington,\nHarrods Food Hall, pongcheese.co.uk\nYes, *that* Blur bassist has only gone\nand bought himself a farm before\ngoing into cheesemaking. Sounds like\nthe British version of The American\nDream; but when his venture now\nproduces award-winning cheeses that\nhave had us going back for more (since\nlast year\u2019s ToC festival!), you really\ncan\u2019t complain. All of James\u2019 cheeses\nare stunning - we can\u2019t fault any of\nthem, but Blue Monday - a Shropshire\nblue not unlike a British Gorgonzola\n- really stood out for us from the\ntime we took home a cheeky wedge\nlast year. It\u2019s since been \u201cremixed\u201d\nso it\u2019s a little bit firmer than the Blue\nMonday of yesteryear; but the flavour\nand punch is still as we remember it.\nServe on a cheeseboard, or cook with\nit - we hear one of the Food editors has\na boyfriend who mades a mean blue\ncheese tagliatelle with it...\nIf blue cheese really isn\u2019t your thing,\nnot to worry - the other (milder)\nofferings in his range are just as\nscrummy.

Four high\nprofile judges will set three essay\nquestions and a task for a video\ncategory.\nEvery year the selected judges give\nup their time to talk at the launch\nand grand final events, and chose\nthe overall winners. They are leaders\nin their fields: academia, science,\njournalism and business. Last year\nthe Director of Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change, Professor Sir Brian\nHoskins, judged one question. The\nyear before Wellcome Trust Head of\nCommunications and former Science\nEditor of the Times Mark Henderson\nwas involved.\nThe Science Challenge is generously\nsponsored: previous winners have\nreceived tours of CERN in Switzerland\nand big cash prizes. All Imperial\nstudents can enter the competition,\nregardless of faculty, as well as\nstudents from any secondary school\nin the country.\nUltimately the Science Challenge\nis here to make the scientists of\ntomorrow stop and think about\nthe problems that affect society as\na whole, and how their scientific\nprowess can help resolve them. But\nimportantly, to also think about how\nto best communicate the science that\naffects people\u2019s daily lives to a wider\naudience, not necessary of the same\nscientific inclination as them.\nJust in case you were wondering, the\nScience Challenge is open for all at\nImperial College, and school students.\nNo matter what faculty you are in, you\nare more than welcome!

Millions of\npeople, and their descendants, now\nexist because of this.\nHowever, these victories exist in the\nshadow of those threats which remain.\nPathogens such as HIV, influenza\nvirus and Hepatitis C virus represent\nmore complicated foes, able to evolve\nbeyond our existing techniques.\nFresh innovation is required \u2013 a\nbattleplan is needed.\nGathering Intelligence\nWithout information, the war is\nalready lost. Understanding each\npathogen\u2019s journey, through one host\nand into the next, can reveal its most\nvulnerable moments \u2013 our windows\nof opportunity.\nAchieving this requires a strong\nfoundation of research \u2013 particularly\nthe existence models for studying\npathogens at the lab bench, rather\nthan in patients. Some diseases, such\nas Hepatitis C have proven challenging\nto grow in the lab, slowing efforts to\nstudy them.\nProgress is being made in this\narea, but each discovery reveals new\nquestions. By improving our tools we\ninch closer to spotting that chink in\nthe armour, and exploiting it.\nSelecting a Target\nThe right target makes all the differ-ence. Vaccines are typically designed\naround a marker, called an epitope,\nselected from the outside of an invading pathogen. This trains the immune\nsystem to rapidly recognise and neu-tralise the invader, a vital head-start in\nbattle.\nPicking the right epitope is essential \u2013 it will be the calling card of the\ninvader that the immune system re-members. However, successful pathogens often have a high rate of change\nin their DNA as they replicate \u2013 creating populations with a huge range of\nslightly different epitopes even within\na single infected individual.\nPathogens such as HIV use this\nability to create a constantly shifting\nbattlefield \u2013 altering their epitopes\nto reset their recognisability. This\nconstant guerrilla warfare keeps the\npathogen hidden, and the immune\nsystem guessing.\nCurrent research is overcoming\nthis problem using shrewd selection,\nrather than brute force. Avoiding the\nobvious epitopes which can easily be\nchanged, researchers are selecting\nareas which the pathogen needs to\nkeep fixed in order to maintain its\ninfectivity. This puts the pathogen\nin a lose-lose situation \u2013 either get\nrecognised, or become less infectious.\nWith the target selected, an\nappropriate weapon is required.\nIn the Armoury\nVaccines are not all alike. We know\nthe body creates different types\nof immune response according to\nthe pathogen encountered, and a\nsuccessful vaccine needs to support\nthe correct reaction.\nEarly vaccines have taught us many\nlessons \u2013 early HIV vaccines failed\ndue to ineffective immune responses\nbeing made. The latest vaccines aim to\ncreate subtly-tuned and overlapping\nimmune responses, best designed to\nrepel the target.\nWe also need to think about how\nto deliver the vaccine \u2013 existing\ntechniques using dead pathogens, or\nextracted epitopes are not sufficient.\nNew ideas include using raw DNA\nto immunise people, or exposing\nimmune cells outside the body before\nreintroducing them.\nCounter-Insurgency\nDespite best intentions, our immune\nsystems can sometimes be misdirected\nby invading pathogens.\nResearch has shown that during\nHIV infection, one of our own\nimmune sentinel cells unwittingly\ncarries HIV from the entry site all the\nway to its target, deep inside the body.\nSuch hijacking allows HIV to bypass\nthe dangers of making this journey\nalone, protecting it from the immune\nsystem.\nWhen planning our intervention,\nwe need to allow for the failings in our\nown natural response and fill these\ngaps with carefully designed support.\nOnce incorporating these features, a\nvaccine can be readied for deployment\nin the field.\nCampaign strategy\nA powerful vaccine is only a tool,\nand one that still needs to be applied\ncorrectly.\nTomaximisethelife-savingpotential\nof vaccine, we must prioritise those\ngroups of people who are most at risk,\ncatching the pathogen at a bottleneck\nand reducing its dispersal. The spread\nof disease, influenced by factors such\nas urbanisation and global travel, is\nstudied by the branch of science called\nepidemiology which can guide the use\nof a new vaccine.\nEpidemiologists can advise on how\nprevious vaccination strategies have\nwork, and how local conditions such\nas lifestyles, diets and even other\nexisting diseases can change the way\na vaccine will work. Without this\nplanning, even a good vaccine can fail\nto have the desired effect.\nA Winnable War?\nAdvances are coming, but the\nremaining challenges are the hardest.\nWhen fighting these constantly\nevolving pathogens, we must evolve\nour own tactics in parallel. Success lies\nin unifying the advances in all the fields\nmentioned, creating effective vaccines\nbuilt upon a strong foundation of\nknowledge. Our intervention will take\nplace in an already chaotic natural\nbattlefield between a pathogen and\nour immune system, so understanding\nboth belligerents is critical to lending\nuseful support.\nThe challenge of understanding this\nchaos should not deter us, but give us\nhope for success \u2013\n\u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also\nopportunity\u201d\nGeneral Sun Tzu, The Art of War.\nEssay by Ben Bleasdale.\n\n"

This means that\nthey will have minimum professional\nstandards and there will be a route for\nredress in the case of misconduct.\n\u2022The running costs of a rental\nproperty include a list of things\nsuch as: BTL mortgage repayments,\ntax on rental income, repairs and\nrefurbishments (allow for around 10%\nof annual rent), agency fees (varies,\nusually around 12% of annual rent)\nand Voids (periods where the property\nis empty \u2013 most landlords again allow\nfor around 10% of rent, but as this is\na student property there is a chance\nthat it could be empty for as much as a\nquarter of the year).\nFinally if you are planning on\ninvesting in South Kensington,\naccording to the London property\nwatch, the average cost for a\n1 bedroom property in South\nKensington currently is \u00a3912,000; 2\nbedroom is \u00a31.568 million; 3 bedroom\nis \u00a32.256 million. Back in early 2006,\nhouse prices in South Kensington for\na 1 bedroom property was just below\n\u00a3500,000. This can be compared with\nfigures to properties in Hammersmith,\nBecome a property owner in London\nImperial houses some of the wealthiest\nstudents in the UK. At Imperial,\nstudents are only able to live in college\nprovided student accommodation for\ntheir first year, before moving out with\nfriends or becoming a hall senior. As\nSW7 is the most expensive postcode\nin the UK, rent in the neighbourhood\ncan be extremely expensive. One\nway some parents get around this\nproblem is through investing in\nproperty in London. Trends are good\nat the moment in London, with the\nLondon Property Watch measuring\n14.2% growth in house prices for a one\nbedroom property in London between\nOctober 2012 and October 2013.\nMost universities can accommodate\nfirst years in halls of residence, but\naround 70% of all students in most\nuniversity towns will be looking to\nthe private sector for accommodation\n(Telegraph, August). According\nto HESA (the Higher Education\nStatistics Agency), in the 2011/12\nacademic year, there were around\n2.5m students in Britain, so this would\namount to 1.75m students looking for\naccommodation.\nIn the past 18-24 months, there\nhas been a 20-30% uplift in parents\nspecifically purchasing properties\nfor their children to live in during\nstudy. These customers are generally\ndissatisfied with the return on their\nother investments such as pensions,\nISAs etc, and want something that\nwill offer a decent return whilst\nsimultaneously helping their son or\ndaughter through study. Once their\nchild\u2019s period of study has passed, they\nwill either sell the house or continue\nto rent it out for a steady income\nbooster. These customers may already\nhave a buy-to-let property, however\nwill not be experienced in property\ninvestment. Key factors which they\nmust take into account when choosing\na property is the area, property type,\nhow to finance it, how to manage it,\netc. These factors coupled with the\nprobability that the parents will be\nbuying at a distance means that a good\nletting agent is recommended.\nUsually a student plus around\n3-5 others will live in the property,\nbut rent will only be charged to the\nhousemates. This is important, as\nthere are regulatory implications for\nmortgages on properties that you\nwill let to family members \u2013 by only\ncharging rent to the housemates, the\nparents avoid this.\nA few pointers to parents investing\nin university digs for their son or\ndaughter:\n\u2022Most BTL mortgage lenders\nrequire the rental income to cover the\nmortgage interest by about 120\u2013130%.\nIn order to achieve a good yield, many\nBTL investors opt for an interest-only\nrather than a repayment mortgage \u2013\nhowever, this means that the capital\npart of the loan needs to be repaid,\neither by the sale of the property or a\nseparate \u2018investment vehicle\u2019.\n\u2022Your letting agent should be\naccredited by ARLA (the Association\nof Residential Letting Agents), NAEA\n(the National Association of Estate\nAgents) or RICS (the Royal Institute of\nBusiness Editor\nJames Tsim\nwhere the average 1 room property\nis just less than \u00a3400,000.

A survey was\nput to international students earlier\nthis month to canvas opinion on these\nissues, and the results of this survey\nwere used to form a paper presented\nto Union Council by Marissa\nLewis, Deputy President (Welfare)\non November 12. It was passed\nunanimously, meaning the Union\u2019s\nstance on this issue is clear: we oppose\nany policy that would adversely affect\nour international students.\nThere are two proposals in the\nImmigration Bill in particular which\naffect international students \u2013 the first\nis the introduction of an NHS fee of up\nto \u00a3200 per year of study, paid before\nentry into the country. For doctoral\nresearch students with families, this\ncould add up to \u00a33000 to their costs\nof studying in the UK. Although\nthere is a persistent stereotype that\nall international students are rich,\n51% of students claimed it would be a\nfinancial struggle to pay this levy.\nThe second proposal is introducing\na fine to any private landlord who\ndoesn\u2019t check the immigration status\nof their tenants, raising fears that\nlandlords would simply refuse to rent\nto international students to save them\nthe time and bother. With 29% of\ninternational students already saying\ntheir fee status makes it difficult to\nrent accommodation, this change may\nfurther restrict access to safe, high\nquality housing.\nOne of the most shocking findings\nof the survey was that the proposed\nchanges would have discouraged\n60% of international students\nfrom applying to Imperial College\nLondon. In the face of an increasingly\ncompetitive global market for higher\neducation, the changes could be\ncatastrophic to Imperial as we rely\non international students and staff to\nmaintain our status as one of the top\nuniversities in the world.\nSince passing through Council, the\nsuccessful paper has been making its\nway through College. Marissa Lewis,\nDeputy President (Welfare) presented\nthe paper to the Vice Provost\u2019s\nAdvisory Group (Education) and,\nas a result, has gained the support\nof Professor Denis Wright, Director\nof Student Support and Sharon\nBolton, Head of International Student\nSupport. Professor Debra Humphries,\nVice Provost (Education) is also\nincluding the text of the paper in her\nregular report to the Provost Board\ntaking place today.\nThe Union is joining with the\nnational campaign of students\u2019\nunions from across the UK to call\non Parliament to allow international\nstudents to be exempted from these\nproposals. The next step being taken is\nto lobby the House of Lords, where the\nBill will next be debated. The Union is\ncalling for students to add their voices\nto an open letter to the members of\nthe House of Lords (pictured) who\nhave ties with Imperial. Students can\nalso support the National Union of\nStudents\u2019 campaign by signing their\npetition and writing to their local MP\nusing an online form.\nWhether you are an international\nstudent or someone who recognises\nthat international students provide\nour College with a wealth of talent and\ndiversity that we should be protecting,\nyou can find out details of how to get\ninvolved with the campaign here:\nimperialcollegeunion.org/\nimmigrationbill\nFashionSoc on London\nFashion Week 13\nMetamaterial Magic\nKeir Little interviews Professor John\nPendry\n8\niScience\nComing soon: Imperial\u2019s\nScience Magazine\n37\n\n"

In fact, despite their\ngroundbreaking discoveries (the four\nstages of sexual response, multiple\norgasms, vaginal lubrication), most\nof the general public would not know\nabout them were it not for their TV\nshow-inspiring personal relationship.\nAfter years of collaborating in some\nof, literally, the most hands-on projects science has to offer (I\u2019m sorry to\nsay dissecting Drosophila flies pales\ncompared to inventing giant glass\nvibrators), Masters married Johnson\nand the two became inseparable companions in life and work. Despite their\ndivorce, and recent interviews with\nthe late Mrs Masters revealing that\nthe two never loved each other and\nthat Virginia married Bill out of fear\nof compromising her job, the show is\ncurrently airing the sweet initial stage\nof the relationship.\nMichael Sheen is, unsurprisingly, in-credible, managing to portray a character who is both innocent and dis-turbing, likeable and creepy. Similarly,\nLizzie Caplan (\u2018mean girl\u2019 Janis Ian)\nis perfectly able to handle the comparison with her talented colleague.\nShe is such a strong female lead that\nit is hard not to like her. Even so, Miss\nJohnson is not just a romantic hero-ine, but a complex figure: a sexually\nconscious single mother, ambitious,\ncompetitive, free-spirited, and trou-bled. Caplan is able to show the inside\nworries of her character, driven and\ndedicated to her work, yet tormented\nby having to leave her children.\nAlthough the show has been criticized for approaching sexual liberation too freely and for not presenting\nthe pressures that society must have\nimposed on such an independent\nwoman, the actors perfectly portray\nthe personal struggles and moral di-lemmas. The other characters\u2019 stories\nare equally compelling, with subjects\nsuch as homosexuality and traditional\nmarriage creating riveting plotlines.\nIn addition, the set is so beautiful that\neveryone from Downton Abbey geeks\nto Mad Men aficionados will enjoy it.\nFinally, it is rare to find a program\nthat so accurately depicts the everyday\nlife of scientists. In this program, the\nactors do not spend their time flirting with each other whilst occasionally wearing white coats. Research is\nan important side of the series and,\nalthough it is not a recollection about\nthe joys of grant proposals and Eppendorfs, it definitely succeeds in showing\nthe ambition and motivation of scientists and even in making them a tiny\nbit sexy for once. This show was made\nfor Imperialites, as it\u2019s basically intellectual porn: love and research as an\nexcuse to watch TV on a Sunday evening without feeling guilty about the\nunfinished lab report.\nGiulia Gabrielli Television Writer\nWhat\u2019s on this week\nSherlock\nBefore the long-awaited third series\nbegins (the date of the premiere is\nas of yet unreleased), remind yourself of what happened in the last\nseries of the modern-day retelling\nof the detective.\nFriday 29th November,\nBBC Three, 9pm\nDon\u2019t miss New this week On catch-up\nDon\u2019t Ever Wipe Tears Without\nGloves\nAnother Scandinavian import, this\nthree-part miniseries is the story\nof young love in the Stockholm\ngay community at the height of the\nAIDS scare.\nMonday 2nd December,\nBBC Four, 10pm\nDoctor Who: The Day of the\nDoctor\nIn case you missed it, the much-hyped 50th anniversary episode\n(along with the 3D version) is\navailable online, along with all the\ncelebratory specials and documen-taries.\nOnline on 4oD until Sunday\nSamurai Jack aired on Cartoon Network from 2001-2004. It was created by\nGenndy Tartakovsky, also the creator of Dexter\u2019s Lab and a producer on The\nPowerpuff Girls. It tells the story of an unnamed samurai (nicknamed Jack)\nfrom \u201clong ago in a distant land\u201d (a deliberately nebulous era/place where\nRobin Hood, Vikings, Cossacks and samurai coexist), who is tasked with defeating an evil demon named Aku using a magic sword forged by the gods.\nStandard hero\u2019s journey fantasy stuff, but the snag is that Aku transports\nJack to the far future, where he has succeeded in taking over the Earth and\nturning it into a seedy spaceport. Jack\u2019s mission is then to defeat Aku and\nfind a way back home. It\u2019s still pretty simple, but also unique and creative.\nOne interesting feature of the show is that there are almost no recurring\ncharacters \u2013 most of the time Jack is alone as he wanders from place to place\nlooking for a way home. Many episodes contain almost no dialogue, yet\nsomehow still remain gripping. The only recurring character besides Jack\nand Aku is The Scotsman (again, never named), who has a machine gun leg\nstraight out of a Robert Rodriguez movie. Just thought I\u2019d throw that out\nthere.\nThe plot of each episode is usually very simple: Jack wants to get from A to\nB but Aku has sent something to stop him, or Jack must save someone from\nBad Things that Aku has done. The simplicity of the plots allows the show to\nfocus on the action scenes and the interesting characters that Jack meets.\nThe show is not afraid to mix genres \u2013 for example, Aku\u2019s minions are all\nrobots (allowing Jack to slice an infinite number without spilling a drop of\nblood). Jack frequently encounters monsters of all shapes and sizes, and\nthey rarely state whether they\u2019re aliens or something magical \u2013 it basically\ndoesn\u2019t matter. Episodes vary in tone and genre; Jack goes from fighting\nrobots in space to trying to get past blind archers to reach a magical wishing\nwell \u2013 nothing is off limits.\nTartakovsky\u2019s influences in the show are very obvious, yet they\u2019re diverse\nand colourful. He draws inspiration from Star Wars, old martial arts mov-ies, various anime and comics (one episode is \u2018inspired\u2019 by 300, one is yet\nanother Seven Samurai retelling, but with only one samurai). The art style is\n\u2018Japanese\u2019 (not necessarily anime) and it looks, well, pretty damn good. The\nepisodes are atmospheric, with intense action scenes, yet are never afraid to\nbe light-hearted and fun on occasion.\nYou may be thinking \u2018so Jack wanders from place to place and nothing ever\nhappens\u2019. In a sense, yes, but what\u2019s amazing about the show is how it manages to make this really gripping and engaging. Every episode is an individual work of art and a memorable, satisfying experience. Sadly the series was\nnever finished, and Jack never made it home/defeated Aku. Tartakovsky has\nalways dreamed of finishing it, and recently IDW comics started publishing\na continuation series. Hopefully someday soon Jack will return to the past\nand undo the future that is Aku!\nCartoon Corner\nSamurai Jack: A Retrospective\nTom Rivlin\nchannel 4\ncartoon network\n\n"

Have you researched the areas\nof work that you are interested in? Have you\nlooked at all opportunity providers, large or\nsmall? Have you considered the hidden job\nmarket, and finally, are you doing yourself\njustice on your applications and CV\u2019s?\nOnce you have secured yourself that\ninternship or graduate role it is important to\nrecognise that you are moving into a totally\ndifferent environment that, for many of you,\nmay well feel a bit alien. The workplace. It is\nimportant to ready yourself for this transition\ninto the workplace, as first impressions\nreally do count. How you present yourself,\nyour manner, and interactions with your\nnew colleagues, really will last. If you are\ngoing onto an internship or placement it\nis important to be aware of this as these\ninteractions with your colleagues could well\ndetermine whether you receive a permanent\noffer of a full time role on completion of\nyour studies. Lots of organisations are using\ntheir internship programmes as a way to\nidentify talent early on and to start building\na relationship with their future employees.\nThis, for you, is a great opportunity to really\nshow what you can do, and perhaps even\nsecure a graduate role based on both your\nperformance and the impression that you\nhave made. Starting your final year with a\njob offer is a great position to be in.\nSome of you will also be starting with a\ncompletely new employer. Again, your initial\ninteractions with your new colleagues will\ncreate an impression, and you want to make\nsure it\u2019s a good one as you embark on your\ncareer after your years of study at Imperial.\nThe Careers Service has compiled some\nkey considerations to note before you start\nyour new role to enable you to make that all\nimportant first impression.\n1 Remember that you are no longer within\nyour familiar environment, with well-known\nfaces who you have got to know over the\nlast 3 to 4 years. How you now need to\ncommunicate may well differ markedly\nto how you talk with fellow students and\nfriends. This also is the case in your written\ninteractions in the workplace. You should\nmaintain a professional approach. Also don\u2019t\nbe too quick to disclose details about yourself\nthat you may regret later. As a rule of thumb,\nif it feels wrong to say or write something,\nthen generally it is! Learn to listen to your\nintuition. It is something you will rely on as\nyou progress through your career.\n2 Consider your social media presence.\nSome organisations may check out your\nFacebook profile. Those holiday photos that\nwere taken last year might be best if they are\nnot accessible to your employer. Ensure that\nyou have your privacy settings set to the full.\nSome organisations even recommend that\nyou have two Facebook pages, one for your\npersonal life and another for your outward\nfacing professional life. Also if you use\nTwitter remember that these 140 character\nstatements are open to all to see. Take care\nwith what you tweet! There have been a few\ncases recently of past tweets coming back to\nhaunt people. LinkedIn is also something\nelse to consider. If you don\u2019t have a LinkedIn\naccount you should consider one. This will\nnot only give you a professional front of\nhouse image, but it\u2019s also a great way to keep\nconnected to all the professional contacts\nyou will start to make.\n3 People can start to form impressions\nstraight away. Your body language and\nappearance is important. Dress appropriately\nfor the organisation and when being\nintroduced to your new colleagues offer a\nfirm handshake and make eye contact. Have\ntidy, well groomed hair, nails etc. and be\nconservative with jewellery, make up, and\nso on. This sounds very obvious, but in the\nCareers Service we often hear feedback from\nemployers about times when students have\nnot quite made the transition from student\nlife to working life successfully. Also show\nsome of your personality and smile. By the\nend of the day you will be amazed at how\ntiring it is to permanently display a positive\npersona, but it will certainly help you\nintegrate and build up a circle of friends and\nsupport at work.\n4 Now you are in the workplace be careful\nto adhere to some basic professional business\netiquette. Be alert and engaged, polite and\ncourteous. Show consideration for others.\nDuring all your research before applying\nyou will have gathered some idea about the\norganisations culture and values. Do not\nforget these on day one. Remember that you\nshould show respect for all employees from\nthe reception staff right up to the CEO. Most\norganisations now have a very strict code of\nconduct which includes aspects of mutual\nrespect for all employees. This might be the\nfirst time that you have been in the situation\nof instructing someone or supervising\nanother person. This should be done in a\npositive, supportive way, appreciating the\nindividual\u2019s skills and strengths.\n5 Emails and phone calls can be the first\nindication to an employer of how you will\nfit into the organisation. When writing\nemails use professional language and\ncertainly don\u2019t be tempted to use shorthand\ntext style language or add smiley faces to\ncorrespondence. Start emails with Dear and\ncontinue to do so until you have established\na relationship with whoever you are writing\nto and they perhaps reply with \u201cHi\u201d. Do not\nuse work time or email for personal use and\nthe same goes for having your Facebook page\nopen at your desk. Over time, once you have\ngained a bit of confidence and awareness of\nthe organisation, it may ok to use the internet\nover lunch for personal use, however do not\nassume this. Remember, if your intuition\ntells you this feels wrong, it probably is.\nSome other points to consider are using\nheadphones to listen to music, eating at your\ndesk, and trying to become too familiar with\nnew colleagues. This will take time, so take\nyour time. Get to know them, how they act\nand talk with each other and before long you\nwill feel comfortable in your interactions\nwith them. It pays to spend the first few\nweeks trying to listen and absorb as much as\npossible and this also means the culture of\nthe work place.\nThese are just some of the aspects that you\nneed to be aware of as you start work. You\nwill undoubtedly come across more, however\njust as Imperial was a learning experience,\nso is the workplace. Employability skills are\nnot something that you learn once and never\nimprove on. You will be learning new things\nevery day and these will make you into the\nexperienced and desirable professional that\nyou are striving to become.\nFor more information on some of these\nissues visit www.imperial.ac.uk/careers\nThe Careers Service\nImperial College London\nCareers\nEvents\nWorkshop\n2 December, 12:30 \u2013 14:00\nPreparing for Assessment Centres \u2013 In-Tray / E-tray\nExercises\nGetting an Internship in\u2026\n2 December, 13:00 \u2013 14:00\nMedia, Broadcasting and Journalism Sectors\nWorkshop\n3 December, 12:30 \u2013 14:00\nGroup Mock Interview\nLunchtime Careers Talk\n3 December, 13:00 \u2013 13:50\nLaw for Non-Lawyers\nWorkshop\n4 December, 12:30 \u2013 14:00\nPreparing For Assessment Centres - Group Activities\nSeminar\n4 December, 16:15 \u2013 17:15\nInterviews\nEmployer-Led Skills Workshop\n4 December, 13:30 \u2013 15:30\nTeamworking Skills Workshop (Rolls-Royce)\nBook in person at Careers Service - \u00a310 deposit\nrequired (correct change only!)\nWorkshop\n5 December, 12:30 \u2013 14:00\nPreparing For Assessment Centres - Presentation\nSkills\nSeminar\n5 December, 16:15 \u2013 17:15\nAssessment Centres\nSeminar\n6 December, 16:15 \u2013 17:15\nApplying for Postgraduate Study\nErm, wearing a balaclava to a networking event probably gives a bad impression.\nApply via Jobs Live unless stated\n\n"

To the left, the world\u2019s poor\nare caught in a poverty trap; without\nthe minimum resources to help them\nhelp themselves, they will never break\nout of this cycle. Aid, then, is clearly\nneeded as a big push to kick things\noff. To the right, aid encourages\ndependency, distorts markets and\nprops up nasty regimes \u2013 keeping the\npoor in their place. There is no sign\nof either side winning this battle. But\nsubjecting individual aid projects to\nrobust statistical analysis through\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs),\nmodelled on medical trials, could\nprovide a way out of the ideological\nmire.\nSo what is aid? Aid can come in many\nforms \u2013 such as military aid to help a\ncountry fight terrorists, or budgetary\naid sent with no strings attached to\nbolster a government\u2019s finances, or the\ncancelling of historic debts. Here we\nfocus on a more altruistic form of aid\n\u2013 that sent to help the world\u2019s poorest\nwith little expectation of benefit to the\ndonor, for example direct financing of\nmosquito nets or primary schools.\nThe moral cause for wishing to\nalleviate world poverty is a clear one.\nThat one billion people live on this\nplanet on less than a dollar a day while\nso many of us live in luxury is surely a\nmoral outrage. The philosopher Peter\nSinger has compared such inaction to\nstanding by a lake as a child drowns.\nSurely, he reasons, no person would\ngive a seconds thought to diving in?\nPractically speaking, of course, giving\naid is complex and costly yet the\nprinciple, he argues, is the same.\nThis metaphor succinctly\nencapsulates the argument for aid\n\u2013 that only immediate, decisive and\npotentially painful action, essentially\ndiving in, can help the poor. The clear\nimplication of Singer\u2019s reasoning is\nthat the solution is to get actively\ninvolved \u2013 but what if modern aid\noffers our metaphorical child little\nmore than a faulty life ring? Or worse,\nwhat if aid actually helps to drag her\ndown? This is the real question in the\naid debate. This goes beyond rock\nconcerts and emotive advertisements;\nis the obvious solution the right one?\nDiving In\nMany would say yes. These aren\u2019t\nsolely rock stars and actors \u2013\ndistinguished professors of economics\nsuch as Columbia\u2019s Jeffery Sachs see\naid as an essential way of unlocking\nthe economic potential of the poor.\nIn his book The End of Poverty, Sachs\npoints to farming as an example of this\n\u2013 if farmers are donated fertiliser, they\ncan massively increase their harvest,\nwhich in turn gives them money to\nbe able to buy their own fertiliser next\nyear, thus creating a virtuous cycle.\nFor Sachs, the farmers are caught\nin a poverty trap (unable to buy the\nfertiliser they need to progress) and\nwithout an aid-based kick-start (free\nfertiliser) they will never escape from\npoverty. Sachs sees this poverty trap\nmodel applying to many other areas\nof development \u2013 sick, poor people\ncannot afford medicine, but whilst\nthey are ill they are unable work,\nmeaning that they get even poorer. But\naid also has a larger role to play. It can\nhelp small, cash strapped democracies\nstay on their feet and provide for\ntheir people\u2019s basic needs. It can also\nkick-start basic infrastructure such as\nroads and schools.\nSufficiently compelled by this call to\naction, I headed off with some other\nImperial College students last year to\nwitness just this type of aid \u2013 designed\nto kick-start economic progress \u2013 in\nrural Kenya. Herdsmen, caught by\na severe drought, were encouraged\nto take up fishing. A British charity\nsubsidised nets and boats for the\nfledgling fishermen, with the idea\nthat the subsidies could be gradually\nreduced as the economy took off. Each\nboat would take ten fishermen and\neach fisherman supported around ten\ndependents, meaning 100 people were\nhelped by just one boat. It seemed to\nbe the perfect project.\nUnforeseen Consequences\nThere are, however, powerful\narguments against this kind of help.\nOn a nationwide scale, the large\nand sudden influx of foreign money\nmakes the local currency rise in\nvalue, suffocating exports. This was\nbest documented in Holland when\nthe manufacturing sector contracted,\nfollowing the discovery of natural gas\nin 1959, earning the phenomenon the\nname Dutch disease. Furthermore,\nmoney given to poor country\ngovernments needn\u2019t necessarily\nend up going to infrastructure or\nhealthcare. According to Paul Collier\nof Oxford University, 40% of African\nmilitary spending is funded by aid,\nunbeknownst to the donors. It is\ncertainly no secret that the poorest\ncountries often have the nastiest\nregimes.\nAid can also undermine democracy,\nmaking poor countries accountable\nto donors, not to their citizens. The\nold American maxim of \u2018no taxation\nwithout representation\u2019 too often\nworks in reverse \u2013 no representation\nwithout taxation. When poor\ncountries rely on foreign funds and\nnot taxes from local people and\nbusinesses, the need to be accountable\nto citizens is reduced and corruption\nand inefficiencies can more easily set\nin. Somaliland provides an excellent\ncounter-example \u2013 not recognised\nas a country by the international\ncommunity, it cannot receive aid\nand in fact has seen significant\nimprovements in accountability\nand reduced corruption as citizens\ndemand more for their taxes. And\nlastly, we cannot forget the ethical\nimplications of aid recipients relying\non public services provided by\npoliticians in wealthy countries for\nwhom they cannot vote.\nThe Truth Lies in the Data\nWhere does this leave the Kenyan\nfishermen? They lack a mature\nmanufacturing sector so that shouldn\u2019t\nbe an issue. But how could the other\nfactors affect them? It is here that we\nget to one of the biggest problems\nwith aid \u2013 the lack of good data on its\neffectiveness. In truth neither the left\nnor right perspectives can offer a good\nevaluation of such a program without\nfirst gathering data. This was exactly\nwhat we did in Kenya.\nThrough interviewing 200 of the\nfishermen, we were able to gain a\nclearer picture of how the subsidies\nwere impacting the local economy.\nThe results were surprising; the perfect\npicture offered by aid evangelists was\nfound to be murky at best. Investment\nin boats turned out to be not only\na surprisingly ineffective way of\ncatching fish \u2013 as opposed to just tying\nnets to rocks and leaving them \u2013 but\nwas also heavily biased in favour of the\nrelatively rich fishermen who could\nafford to pay the unsubsidised half of\nthe price. However, we also found that\ninvestment in nets, especially targeted\nat the poorest, was a very cost effective\nway of helping out, with nets paying\nfor themselves after two months.\nThis was not only interesting, it was\nalso very useful. The data enabled the\ncharity to refocus its efforts, saving\nvaluable donations and improving the\nquality of life for the fishermen.\nOur research is part of a bigger\nshift in the aid debate \u2013 its scientific\nrevolution. In seeking out quality data,\nwe were able to get to the heart of the\nissue. The apex of this is the use of\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs),\nin the style of medical trials, on aid\nprojects. The idea is simple. Half of\na population is given a form of aid\n(nets, extra teachers etc.) while the\nother isn\u2019t. Those who do and don\u2019t\nreceive the aid are chosen at random\nand in such a way that they cannot\naffect each other so that the impact of\nthe aid can be clearly demonstrated.\nEssentially like any lab experiment.\nThe idea is simple and common sense\nto any science student but it is having\na significant impact on a hitherto\nopaque world.\nThe world before evidence-based\nmedicine is hard to imagine \u2013\nquack doctors of varying credibility\ncombined folklore and pseudoscience\nto propose cures for just about any\nillness. Today, trials form the basis of\nmedicine. Think of the 1991 discovery\nthat folic acid reduces incidence of\nspina bifida, as a result of which 10% of\nthe world\u2019s flour is now fortified with\nthe acid and thousands of such birth\ndefects have been prevented. This\nsame process is gradually taking place\nin aid. RCTs in Uganda have found\nthat providing food in schools won\u2019t\nincrease enrolment, but it does boost\nattendance. RCTs across Africa have\nfound that charging even a nominal\nfee for a malaria bed greatly reduces\ntheir use, contrary to the intuitive\nview that people only value what they\npay for. Aid is experiencing its own\nscientific revolution.\nThe pioneers of this field are\nundoubtedly Professors Abhijit\nBanerjee and Esther Duflo of MIT\u2019s\nPoverty Action Lab, who have been\nworking in this area since the Lab\u2019s\nfounding in 2003. In their 2011 book\nPoor Economics, they outline the\nresults of their RCT work. Their\nfindings agree with neither left nor\nright, they simply find out what\nworks. A new student union project\nat Imperial College called The African\nDevelopment Project is dedicated to\ndoing just this; involving science and\nengineering students in the evaluation\nof aid projects.\nThe potential of RCTs is very\nexciting indeed. They can provide no\nmagic bullet \u2013 far too many such cures\nhave been proposed in the past \u2013 but\nthey do provide a way to go beyond\nthe ideological warfare and change\nthe aid debate for the better. Beyond\nsimple moralising and abstract\nphilosophising, scientific trials offer\nperhaps the most effective approach\nyet to understanding and tackling\npoverty. Its message is simple: find\nout what works, and then fund what\nworks.\nImperial students interested in\nlearning more about what makes an\neffective charity might want to attend\n\u201cHow To Run The Most Effective\nCharity In The World\u201d on Thursday 5th\nDecember, 6pm Huxely 145, a panel\ndiscussion with the directors of two of\nGiveWell\u2019s 3 \u201cmost effective charities in\nthe world 2013\u201d and the director of a\ncharity consultancy.

For the\nchildren of Tanzania,\nthis is not always true. Less than 20%\nof Tanzanian children have access to\nsecondary school education. This is\ndue to the lack of funds and secondary\nschools that do not work closely\ntogether. However, a glimmer of hope\ncomes in the form of TEKUA. As an\neducation centre that provides free\neducation for the neediest students,\nTEKUA aims to empower its students\nwith knowledge, giving them a means\nto make a living. TEKUA gives them\nhope, and our dream of a better future.\nTwo local men, Chris and Ally, saw\nthe plight of teenagers and decided to\nset up a centre where young people\ncan learn basic skills. Together,\nthrough much personal sacrifice, they\npurchased a building in Usa River,\nabout twelve miles outside Arusha.\nThere are about 120 students in\nTEKUA. All students (ages 13-25)\ncomefromimpoverishedbackgrounds\nwho cannot afford regular secondary\nschool education. The students of\nTEKUA study English, Art and basic\nIT skills. Learning English allows\nthem to gain employment as safari\nguides and the other subjects equip\nthem with the skills necessary to set\nup their own businesses and sell what\nthey have created. This allows them to\nmake a living to support themselves\nand their families as well as to be able\nto join the workforce.\nTEKUA relies heavily on donations\nfrom charitable organisations such\nas Helping Africa 100 to fund the\neducation centre and its activities.\nHowever, 10% of their expenditure\ncomes from self-sustaining ventures\nsuch as the selling of artwork and\nsouvenirs made by their students. This\nreliance on donations is worrying;\nwhen financial difficulties arise,\nvery often the grants dry up. This\nhappened in 2008, when the financial\ncrisis caused TEKUA to nearly shut\ndown due to a lack of funds.\nEnactus Imperial began its\ninvolvement with TEKUA in 2007,\nwhen project founder Kushboo\nLalwani visited Tanzania and\ndiscovered it. She saw firsthand what\nshe had always seen in the media \u2013 the\ndeprived conditions under which the\nlocals were living. She saw how the\nabsence of the most basic ideas and\nobjects were hindering the growth of\na Tanzanian child in every dimension\nimaginable. She came back to Imperial\nand decided to import the artwork\nthat she had seen in Arusha. She,\nwith the help of other students, went\non to display it in a very successful\nexhibition. The capital raised was\nused in relocating the TEKUA to a\nbetter location, positioning it within\nthe reach of the larger region.\nIn recent years, the economic\nsituation in Tanzania has been\nimproving. More tourists than ever\nare visiting the safaris, making the\nArusha region a staple location on the\nsavvy traveler\u2019s list. However, the safari\nindustry is becoming increasingly\nsaturated, prompting TEKUA to begin\nteaching new courses in carpentry and\nfurniture making. Vocational skills\nsuch as these are in demand in rural\nareas, where a trip to the furniture\nstore in the commercial centre of\nArusha is a luxury few can afford.\nHowever, many students graduating\nfrom their course at TEKUA find\nthemselves with the skills, but without\nthe tools to make a living. One of the\ncauses that money from the exhibition\nwill go to is the funding of carpentry\nkits for the brightest students,\nallowing them to sustain themselves\nonce they graduate. In this way, by\nCheong Yi Heng\nTEKUA Director, Enactus\nHear Hidden Voices of Africa at ICBS\nsupporting themselves and not being\nreliant on charitable donations, the\nsustainable source of income will see\nthem through longer than a simple\ngrant can.\nEnactus Imperial this year also\nhopes to engage both students and\nteachers of TEKUA from the UK\nthrough the internet. Generous\ndonations of computers and hardware\nequipment from businesses have\nallowed TEKUA to set up its own\nlittle cyber caf\u00e9, the profits of which\ngo to sustaining the education centre.\nThe team aims to develop a package\nof teaching materials, geared both at\nteachers and students of Tekua, to\nempower them with soft skills such as\nbasic management and fundamental\nfinance. Doing this would benefit\nnot only the teachers in their job of\nrunning the centre; the students would\nalso have a chance to be taught skills\nand concepts they would otherwise\nnot have access to. With students\ngoing from primary school to TEKUA,\nand then directly into jobs that force\nthem to balance their expenses from\nday one, failure to empower is not an\noption.\nThe situation in TEKUA has\nimproved much in the past decade,\nand the centre has grown to be able to\naccommodate more students, lifting\nthem out of backbreaking poverty.\nEnactus Imperial has worked with\nthe centre since 2007 and seen it go\nfrom strength to strength. Much still\nneeds to be done, however, and for\nall the students that pass through its\nclassrooms, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket\ncompared to the overwhelming need\nfor education in the country. Faced\nwith such statistics, it\u2019s easy to lose\nhope. TEKUA refuses. Its drive to give\nunderprivileged Tanzanians a better\nshot at life, its willingness to be the\nboy that throws just one more starfish\ninto the ocean, has brought it this far.\nWhenever help is needed, wherever\nwe can provide it, Team TEKUA and\nEnactus Imperial will be there.\nBut, will you?\nEnactus Imperial hereby invites you,\nthe reader to the ART EXHIBITION:\nTEKUA \u2013 the Hidden Voices of Africa\nshowcasing an intriguing blend of styles\nand unique mediums - highlighting the\nversatility of minds and talent of the\nstudents.\nWE see past, present and future in\ndifferent aspects through expression\nand realism of their artwork. It will be\non the 4th December at the Imperial\nBusiness School Entrance. Come and\nbe amazed! We will also be selling\ndoughnuts to raise money, so grab one\nwhile stocks last!\nB\net you didn\u2019t know\nyour one idea can save\nthe world! You will be\nsurprised to find that in a\ntypical week, the average\nUK household is throwing away\nwhat would have been six complete\nmeals. Not shocking enough? Well,\nhow about picturing five Wembley\nStadiums full of food waste? That is\nthe amount of food waste we generate\nevery year \u2013 all these could have been\ngood, consumable food that would\nhave fed the stomachs of the millions\nwho are badly in need of it And if food\nwasn\u2019t so much of a concern to you,\nhow about heat and fuel, since the\nsupposed worst winter in 50 years is\nhitting us right now? Canary Wharf,\ntall skyscrapers, the London Stock\nExchange \u2013 all the posh and modern\nimages of London would have never\nhinted to you that UK is ranked the\n2nd-highest in Europe for the number\nof people struggling to pay their\nenergy bills. Households are being\ntrapped in fuel poverty, a trend that\nhas increasingly blighted the lives of\nmillions of households. And of course,\nthere are so many other issues like\nenvironmental damage, child poverty,\nageing population and healthcare.\nYou might have heard of all these\nbefore, but have you ever stopped\nand pondered seriously the extent of\nall these social problems affecting the\nUK?\nYou might ask \u2013 how does one\nindividual solve all these and more?\nIt might sound really tough, but\nrest assured that it is not totally\nimpossible. In fact, what you really\nneed is an idea. A good idea that may\nbe simple, easy, yet effective and gives\na great impact when implemented on\na large scale. As amazing as it might\nsound, a single good idea indeed has\nthe ability to make a large difference,\nthanks to a new business model called\nsocial enterprise.\nSocial enterprise is, in the simplest\nterms, a business with a heart.\nFundamentally, it is still a business,\ntherefore making money and\ngenerating profits are still essential.\nIt is, however unlike a charity where\nit gets its income from donations\neither by the government or the\npublic. A social enterprise makes\nits own money through provision of\ngoods or services. But what makes a\nsocial enterprise really different from\ntypical businesses is how the goods\nand services provided help address\na particular social problem, and how\nmost of the profit earned through\nthe business is reinvested to grow the\nbusiness further.\nTherefore, essentially, a single idea\nthat helps address a major social\nproblem may be developed as a\nbusiness and be transformed into a\nworld-changing phenomenon. Take\nfor example The Big Issue, a business\nset up to give homeless people a\nchance to earn income. The Big Issue\nis a news & current affairs magazine\nthat is sold to homeless people for 75p.\nIt is later resold at \u00a31.50. Driven by the\nsocial meaning behind this, it became\nso popular that weekly circulation\nfigures topped 135,000 in the UK.\nWith the mechanism of a social\nenterprise, we at Imperial Hub believe\nthat every student in Imperial has the\npotential to change the world, as long\nas you have an idea for how to do so.\nHence, we are organising for the first\ntime a Social Innovation Bootcamp\nfrom 7-8 Dec 2013. Join us to build\nyour own social enterprise within 48\nhours to solve some of the UK\u2019s most\npressing social issues. There will be a\nseries of workshops where you learn\nfrom our industry experts and hands-on sessions to really get your hands\ndirty. At the end, there will be an\nopportunity for you to pitch to a panel\nof judges. The top team will eventually\nbe shortlisted for mentoring schemes\nand fast-tracked to Imperial Create\nLab\u2019s Venture Catalyst Challenge\n2014!\nEarly bird tickets are available until\nSaturday this week!

Hurrah!\nIn this weeks issue, Felix delves further into\nthe problems with the government\u2019s proposed\nImmigration Bill and we still await a decent\nresponse from Campus Services! Fun, fun,\nfun!\nThe Immigration Bill is a serious issue\nthat will affect a significant proportion of\nour students. It seems to have been poorly\nthought out by the government backers, since\nstudents are a significant proportion of the\nUK\u2019s international population, you would\nhave thought that the government would have\ntaken more care when trying to make changes\nto the way immigrants are treated by the NHS\nand landlords in the UK.\nSimilarly to the government, Felix is still\nconcerned by the apparent disregard Campus\nServices has for it\u2019s student stakeholders.\nWeeks away from the end of term and there\nhas been no significant improvement in the\ncleaning provisions made for students. What\nthis episode has highlighted is that some\nsections of College may seem (to some) to\ntreat the students as objects that have no\nimportant views, rather than smart, rational\nadults that most of us (bar the odd few) are.\nHopefully, within the next week we\u2019ll see\nsome real progress on both issues, with lots\nof new information being presented by both\nsides.\nGood luck with your assignments and\nmarking, term is nearly over!\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nInternational issues and\ncommunication\nLetters\nEbitaspis voluptatem est arum velentecea nobit,\nquam eosam alictor simet recte pedi doluptiisin\npore occumquunt reptae parchilitio.

You better not cry.\nBetter not pout, I\u2019m telling you why: Santa\nClaus is coming to town. He\u2019s making a list,\nchecking it twice. He\u2019s gonna find out who\u2019s\nnaughty or nice. Santa Claus is coming to\ntown!\u201d\nAs juvenile as a Naughty List may seem,\nthe notion of an annual register for badly\nbehaved children is really quite clever. It\u2019s a\nperfect ploy parents use to persuade their\nchildren to make their beds, put their dirty\nclothes in the wash basket and stop thumping\ntheir siblings. I remember my parents telling\nme to be good otherwise Santa would put me\non the Naughty List. Since I didn\u2019t want to\nreceive coal in my stocking, I dutifully obeyed\nthem and for at least one month before the\n25th I was relatively better behaved\u2026 again,\nrelatively. Thankfully I always made it on the\nNice List, and no coal was ever found in my\nstocking.\nLooking back at those childhood\nChristmases, I see that the reward I believed\nwas due to my good actions was actually\nbecause of my parents\u2019 love for me. My\nslightly better behavior had little impact on\nthe presents I received. Those were thanks to\nmy mother and father, who wanted to see the\njoy on my face when I unwrapped my purple\nGame Boy or Bratz doll. They made sure that\nmy fear of being on the Naughty List was only\never a fear because they cared about me.\nAs I\u2019ve grown older, the gifts matter less\nbut the appreciation for the affection they\nrepresent has increased, especially in light of\nChristmas\u2019 history. Over 2000 years ago, God\nsent his only begotten son to permanently\nremove our names from a much more eternal\n\u2018Naughty List\u2019. Swaddled in rags and delivered\ninto this world from a virgin mother, this\nSon came to take on the sins of people like\nyou and me, and to reconcile us with God.\nThough he was but a babe then, his life was\ngoing to be one of sinlessness and selfless love\ntowards all; his purpose, to make God\u2019s glory\nknown through the gift of eternal life to all\nwho believe in Him.\nJust as I didn\u2019t earn the presents my parents\ngave me, so we don\u2019t deserve this much more\nvaluable gift of life, but it is still given to us\nfrom a heavenly father who loves his children\nmuch more than we can fathom. Although\nas a child I only believed myself to be on\nSanta\u2019s Naughty List, as humans, we are on a\n\u2018Naughty List\u2019, for all have sinned and fallen\nshort of God\u2019s glory. Yet, God, in his infinite\nlove, offers us the opportunity of redemption\nthrough the birth, death and resurrection of\nhis only begotten Son.\nAt Christmas time, the significance of Jesus\u2019\nbirth often becomes a blip in the holiday\nseason. Between the second viewing of\nLove Actually and the fight for the piece of\nChristmas cake with the most marzipan on\ntop, the true meaning of Christmas is lost.\nTo remember God\u2019s love and to celebrate the\nbirth of Christ, the Imperial Christian groups\non campus are welcoming all students,\nbelievers or not, to the Christmas Carol\nService. The service will be taking place on\nFriday December 6th, 6PM at Holy Trinity\nwith All Saints Church on Prince Consort\nRoad (next to Beit Halls). After the service,\nthere will be mince pies, refreshments, and\na chance to mingle. Everyone is invited, from\nthe nicest to the naughtiest.\nOn the Naughty List\nHannah Edmondson\nWriter\nhopeeternalcookbook.wordpress.com\n\n"

More precisely, I\u2019ll never again get\nto live beside Exhibition Road. I\u2019ll miss it.\n\u201d\nExhibition Ode: Fenton Reflects\nT\nhis being my last of an\nexcessive six years at\nImperial, I can\u2019t help but\nwonder, with more than\na little panic, just how\ndifferent life will be outside of the\nacademic bubble. Excactly how I\u2019ll gel\nwith a world of 9-5s, responsibility,\nmortgages and early nights is\nuncertain. One thing I do know is\nclear: I\u2019ll never again get to live in\nSouth Kensington. More precisely,\nI\u2019ll never again get to live beside\nExhibition Road. I\u2019ll miss it.\nVisiting London from Belfast with\nmy family as a child, I would always\ninsist on a visit here. In every way a\nfuture Imperial physicist, it was the\nScience Museum that leapt out for me\nand would fill up my precious London\nhours; a vast warehouse of discovery\nand invention \u2013 with whole rockets\nand World War II aeroplanes, hands-on exhibits and guided tours. I wanted\nto work there. I wanted to live there,\nor nearby. I ended up doing both.\nActually working at a museum, now\nthat\u2019s a lot of fun. I spent a few months\nas a volunteer guide in the Science\nMuseum\u2019s 1001 Inventions Gallery\n(which looked at science during the\nIslamic Empire), mostly hovering\naround the display on numbers. Did\nyou know that the numerals we use\ntoday were drawn so that the number\nof acute angles each has corresponds\nto the number it represents? Think of\nchubby, rounded zero. Or the number\none with its slanted cap. I imagine I\nbored the hell out of the hundreds of\nschool kids who passed through, but it\nwas an awful lot of fun.\nHeading down the road from\nCollege, taking care to avoid the ever-earnest Mormon missionaries, gives a\ndrive-by viewing of one of the finest\nbuildings in London, the V&A. But\nthis beauty is a war veteran \u00ad\n\u2013 take a\ncloser look and you\u2019ll see that her\nnewly restored side has ugly lumps\nmissing, wounds inflicted by German\nbombers in World War II and left by\nrestorers in memorial. To get to know\nthe museum, the ideal would be to\nspend whole days walking around, but\nfor the exam-pressed Imperial student\nI offer the most convenient way to get\nto know the museum \u2013 my patented\nStudy and Toilet Tour.\nIt is a little known fact that the V&A\ncontains the National Art Library, a\nhuge collection of mouldy old leather-bound books in plush surroundings\nwith 100 desks for studying, open to\nall and free of charge, complete with\ncomfy leather chairs, old fashioned\ndesk lamps and a view of the museum\u2019s\nlarge quadrangle. You can feel like you\nI\nlearned this week that the\nSpanish government have\nrecently been taking lessons from\nGeorge Orwell. The new Citizen\nSecurity Bill is a title worthy of\nthe delicious irony heaped upon the\nvarious ministries in 1984, while the\nSpanish government is trying to use\nit to introduce new laws that brings\nthe Spain of Franco (as described by\nOrwell) uncomfortably close.\nThe bill, if it passes in Parliament,\nlegislates for massive fines (up to\n\u20ac600,000) for a plethora of \u201cvery\nserious crimes\u201d, such as illegal protest\n(including the particularly Latin form\nof grass-roots protest, the \u2018escrache\u2019),\nor publishing photos and data of\npolicemen online. One might argue\nthat this graces the police with an\nelement of immunity. After all, the\npublic is rather stupid and might\nmisconstrue advanced and modern\npolice techniques for brutality,\nassault and all too often, murder.\nOther \u2018serious crimes\u2019 (meriting fines\nof up to \u20ac30,000) include insulting\npolicemen and, um, dangerous,\ncriminal activities such as botellones.\nOr, in English, drinking outside\u2026\nThe way this new bill aims to\nprotect the good citizens of Spain is\nby rendering them destitute if they\nprotest for being, well, destitute. The\nSpanish have very sensibly given up\ntheir financial independence and\nleft the hard work of managing the\neconomy to the Germans (I\u2019m being\nironic).\nThe population doesn\u2019t realise what\na blessing it is to have the time to\nenjoy the golden sun, sea and sands\nof Andalusia. They don\u2019t realise how\nwonderful it is that over 25% of the\npopulation is unemployed. In the\nwords of Morrissey, \u201cI was looking\nfor a job, and then I found a job, and\nheaven knows I\u2019m miserable now!\u201d\nMiserable Morissey may be but\nI hope we can agree the Spanish\npeople probably have it worse. There\nis a sad truth to the mantra \u201cthe only\nthing worse than being exploited by\nreally did get into Oxbridge. Now for\nmy Toilet Tour; go to this library to\nstudy instead of Imperial\u2019s and take\na map. Every time you want a toilet\nbreak, chose a different toilet on any\nfloor you like and take your time\nwalking there. I count eight toilets\nThe Orwellian Spanish Security Bill\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\ncapitalism is not being exploited by\ncapitalism\u201d and history has shown that\ntop-down administration has proved\nremarkably ineffective in resolving\nsocial and political problems. The\nlame attempts by Bismarck and\nAlexander II are cases in point. Even\n\u2018success\u2019 stories such as Park Chunghee of South Korea demonstrate just\nhow problematic attempts at genuine\nreform are when \u2018permitted\u2019 from\nabove. The utter rural-urban divide\nin South Korea was little mentioned\nduring the visit of Park Chung-hee\u2019s\ndaughter to Imperial College recently.\nDespite everything, significant\nhope remains for the Spanish people.\nSpain has a rich and long standing\ntradition of grass-roots and anarchist\nprotest. Eric Hobsbawm\u2019s essay on\nthe \u2018Expropriators\u2019 is one of the most\ntouching historical portraits I have\nread. The 2008 crisis prompted the\nre-emergence of widespread protests\nwhich have engendered this reaction.\nIt indicates, at the very least, that the\nSpanish government must be feeling\nthe heat. If it is overcome it could lead\nto genuine political change. So, in a\nperverse way, is this a positive sign?\nIt all depends on the results. It\nis only with hindsight that we can\ntell whether this will herald a new\nbeginning or simply the beginning of\nthe end. There is, to paraphrase Alain\nBadiou, no objective determination\nof an event. What is required is the\nfurther radicalisation and organisation\nof the protest movement. This means\nless focus on ethics and doing what is\nnecessary and more focus on politics\nand doing what is right. This is not\nquite as paradoxical as it sounds: the\ndifference is best exemplified by the\nopposition of Churchill during WWII\nand Che Guevara in Batista\u2019s Cuba.\nAt the risk of massively reducing the\ncomplexity of the situation, what will\nit be? A new General\u00edsimo or the\nThird Republic? I know which side I\u2019m\non.\nRory Fenton\nColumnist\n@roryfenton\npublicintelligence.com\nI\u2019ll never again get to live in South Kensington.\nMore precisely, I\u2019ll never again get to live beside\nExhibition Road. I\u2019ll miss it.\nI\nn today\u2019s world I would challenge\nany reader of this newspaper to\nnominate a sportsperson that\nthey could truly say they have\nan emotional attachment to.\nMessi, Ronaldo, Federer, Nadal, Tiger\nWoods; these names roll off the tongue\nas behemoths of their respective\nsports. Hearing these names evokes\nadmiration, loyalty, respect, but never\na sense of identification, brotherhood,\nor, most importantly, a sense that that\nparticular player could ever possibly\nbe bigger than the game itself.\nWell, this is precisely where Sachin\nRamesh Tendulkar is different; and\nin a category of his own. For the\nreasons that I will delve further into\nbelow, this man has dominated both\nthe sport as well as the hearts and\nminds of fans; boys, girls, mothers,\nfathers, doctors, lawyers, rich, poor,\nold and young for the best part of a\nquarter of a century. He has carried\nthe hopes and dreams of a nation that\nwas beginning to find its voice and\nemerge from insecurity. The rise and\nrise of Tendulkar coincided with the\nrise and rise of naya India \u2013 and this\nis probably one of the most important\nthings to consider.\nI will try and make the rest of\nthis article as easy as possible to\nunderstand for those of you not yet\nacquainted with the glorious sport\nof cricket. Tendulkar\u2019s career as an\ninternational cricketer began in 1989\nas a tender 16 year-old boy facing\nsome of the most fearsome and skilful\nbowlers to ever grace the game. He\nwas hit in the face, blood flowing from\nhis nose, but continued to play on.\nFast forward 24 years to the day and\nhe bows out from the sport, having\nbroken nearly all conceivable batting\nrecords, plundering runs with ruthless\nefficiency and outrageous flair all over\nthe world. It is almost impossible\nto convey how great his career was\nwithout having to revert to some\nnerdy statistical analysis (cricket fans\nlove stats), and whilst statistics do not\ntell the full story, there is much truth\nto the old adage \u2018the numbers don\u2019t lie\u2019.\nThe best way to measure the\ngreatness of a player during his\ncareer is to compare him to his\ncontemporaries/rivals. He has scored\n24% more Test Match centuries than\nthe next highest century maker. He has\nscored 19% more Test runs than his\nnearest competitor, who has retired,\nincidentally. A whopping 63% and\n34% are Tendulkar\u2019s respective ODI\nnumbers. In addition to this he holds\njust under 100 individual and team\nrecords. Compare these achievements\nto modern day legends such as Tiger\nWoods \u2013 who has yet to beat Jack\nNicklaus\u2019 record of Majors won.\n\u201cIndia is a country where cricket is\nalmost like a religion, and Sachin is\ntreated as a god\u201d. This is a clich\u00e9 that is\nbandied around all the time; I dislike it\nand feel it does injustice to the average\nIndian cricket fan. I would like to\nembark on a more detailed analysis of\nwhat Tendulkar means to Indians. To\nclarify the quote, he has been a beacon\nof hope and aspiration to the entire\nIndian Diaspora. But let me put this\nstatement into context.\nIndia gained independence from\nthe British in 1947. The next 40-50 years were ones of turbulence,\nwars and relative global economic\ninsignificance. Citizens had limited\nheroes and role models, Indian\npoliticians have by and large been a\nsource of despair and corruption, and\ninequality was still widespread. Cue,\nwithin a few years of one another, two\nof the most important Indians of the\npast couple of decades; Manmohan\nSingh and Sachin Tendulkar. The\ncurrent PM and then finance minister\nimplemented wide-sweeping,\ncritically acclaimed economic\nreforms in response to the Balance of\nPayments crisis in 1991. These reforms\nliberalised the economy, opened India\nup to foreign investment and signalled\na new chapter in the development and\ninternational recognition of India. At\nthe same time Tendulkar emerged\nas India\u2019s great national treasure,\nstill merely a boy at the time. He\nwas magnificent; able to tame and\ndecimate all that stood before him\nwith joyful abandon. Tendulkar has\nnow retired, a shadow of his former\nself for the past few years; Singh has\nbeen increasingly ineffective, mainly\ndue to his party\u2019s incompetence and is\nfacing the very real possibility of the\nend of his political career next year\nwith the upcoming general elections.\nThe symmetry between the two is\nstriking.\nComing to the subject of unity and\nequality, Tendulkar brought all sorts\nof people together, in the early days it\nwould be listening in silence around\na transistor radio, and later television\nshops would be invaded to capacity.\nIndeed, such was Sachin\u2019s hold on the\nnation that economic output could be\nseen to drop in the morning after he\nreached stumps not out. People could\nforget about their problems for a short\nwhile when he was batting.\nThroughout the 24 years he has\nrepresented the largest democracy on\nearth, there has never been a scandal\nin which he was implicated. He helped\nrestore credibility to Indian cricket\nafter a damning match fixing expos\u00e9\nin 2000. He played the game in its\ntrue spirit, and was one of the last\nof a generation of real gentlemen.\nHe exhibited sportsmanship down\nto his core and was one of the main\ninstigators in the calling back of\nthe England batsman Ian Bell when\nhe should have been given out. He\nhas hardly said a bad word about\nan opposition player and, out of\nrespect, has hardly ever been abused\nor \u2018sledged\u2019 onfield. This is made\nSach a Life: So long and farewell\nall the more remarkable given the\noverbearing adulation of over a billion\npeople. No other athlete in the history\nof sport has had to deal with so much\ncombined pressure and expectation\nand not buckled at some point.\nFurthermore, Tendulkar was a true\npioneer of his sport. He reinvented\nthe \u2018One Day International\u2019 format\nalmost single-handedly, displaying\na never-before-seen combination of\nthe traditional and the new. Dogged\nby uncommon injuries for a cricketer,\ntennis elbow being his most potent\nnemesis, he also helped scores of\nfirst-class cricketers by leveraging his\nstatus as a healthcare ambassador.\nArjun Jayaswal\nWriter\nThis ensured that these poorly paid\ncricketers would have some kind\nof cushion if they became unfit to\nplay. He even refuses to advertise for\ncompanies that he feels uncomfortable\nwith; one example is his turning down\na $4 million a year contract to be\nsponsored by Vijay Mallya\u2019s United\nBreweries Group.\nTendulkar, for a large proportion\nof people, was synonymous with\nchildhood. Perhaps this is because the\naverage age of the Indian population\nis 26 \u2013 approximately the length of\nhis career. He has straddled three\ngenerations of cricketers in his career,\nbut never seems to have aged. He\nstill has the chubby 16 year old\u2019s face,\nperhaps a little more worn around\nthe edges; he has celebrated every\nopposition wicket with childish glee,\nnever the angry, profanity-inducing\nmacho-isms of others. Fittingly,\nthe most common source of sorrow\nfor cricket fans was that their only\nsource of innocence and current link\nto childhood had been severed when\nTendulkar retired. Even now, merely\nfootage of his strokeplay is enough\nto turn grown men into babbling\nschoolgirls.\nAs I am coming to the end of\nthis article, I would like to add a\nfew personal anecdotes and views.\nMy grandfather (who, incidentally,\nannounced he would leave his job\nif he wasn\u2019t allowed leave to watch a\nparticular Test Match) was fortunate\nenough to watch Tendulkar on his first\ntour of England. He arrived home and\nprophetically exclaimed in Punjabi\n\u201cThis boy is going to be great\u201d. I also\nhad the privilege of watching him bat\non his last tour to England at Lord\u2019s on\nthe 5th day of a pulsating Test Match.\nFor the first time in many people\u2019s\nliving memory, Lord\u2019s was at full\ncapacity on a 5th day.\nI myself have never been one\nfor putting Tendulkar particularly\nhigher than other cricketers, but a\ncertain journalist was able to sum up\nemotions from the past week very\nwell: \u201cmany who didn\u2019t believe they\nwere red-blooded Tendulkarites, or\neven cricket maniacs, listened to him\nspeak and were bewildered by their\nown reaction. They didn\u2019t belong to\nthe \u201cSachin\u201d faithful, yet they sensed\na reverberation\u201d. This is completely\ncorrect; as I listened to his retirement\nspeech, I struggled to contain tears, as\ndid about a billion across the world.\nNot only were the crowd and myself\nmoved beyond belief, but they realised\nthat they had been in love, true love,\nfor 24 years, without them knowing.\nTendulkar, the Little Master has\nbeen a colossus of the game and a\nconstant in every Indian\u2019s life. He\nhas stoked fierce pride in the face of\nopposition, pure enjoyment for the\nneutral, and most of all, someone\nto place all your faith and hope in. I\nhope this article can help those people\nwho don\u2019t know who this great man is\nunderstand the impact he has had.\nFarewell, Sachin, thanks for the\nmemories.\nmirror.co.uk\nin all \u2013 it won\u2019t be long before you\u2019ve\ncovered the entire museum, from the\nincredible collection of statues on the\nground floor to the British Galleries\non level 4. And lunch in the museum\u2019s\ncaf\u00e9 is accompanied by a live pianist\non Saturdays so you\u2019ve no reason to\nleave the place at all, really.\nThen we have the Natural History\nMuseum, a temple to Darwinism and\nthe natural world. The millennium old\nGiant Red Wood segment is worth\ncatching, with the history of the last\n1,400 years marked using its growth\nrings as a timeline. You\u2019ll find it in the\nmain entrance hall, a few floors up.\nNot forgetting the Darwin Centre \u2013\napparently if you flash your Imperial\ncard, smile politely and imply you\u2019re\nsome kind of expert, they\u2019ll let you in\nto see their giant squid. Now there\u2019s\na sentence that I never expected to\nwrite.\nExhibition Road is now\npedestrianised, with the traffic/\npedestrian distinction blurred and\nspeed limits kept to 20 mph, much to\nthe annoyance of drivers. Until two\nyears ago, it was just a regular road,\nwith none of those fancy benches and\n\u2018Boris Bike\u2019 stations. I\u2019m glad for its\nmakeover, because the truth is that it\nis more than a road.\nFor such a busy part of Central\nLondon it\u2019s pretty amazing to have\nplaces where you can sit in complete\nsilence. For such an affluent part of\nthe UK, it\u2019s nice to have such a variety\nof people walking around. We lucky\ndevils get to live here, for now. Make\nthe most of it.\n\n"
