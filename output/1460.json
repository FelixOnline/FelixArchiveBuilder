    "content": "FREE Credit Card Bonuses\nFREE Expenses\n22 felix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nTRAVEL\nTravel Editor\nTravel Editor Dylan Lowe\nDylan Lowe\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGap year free of charge? Globetrotting penniless? felix seeks ways to take advantage of the tourism industry\u2019s\nlittle nuggets, and examines how money-saving these freebies truly are in planning your big trip\nExperiences don\u2019t cost anything\nN\nothing is truly free nowadays. De facto. Don\u2019t\nsuccumb to the sweet enticing promises of freebies thinking it\u2019s an absolute loss-free advantage,\nbecause even during our runs of \u2018fortune\u2019, money\nstill leaks out of our wallets like a prickled barrel.\nNeedless to say, this applies to the travel industry as well: like the\nonline surveys you fill in to win luxury holiday packages, which\nis preceded by an Internet bill; like the free-boat-ride-for-three\nthat comes with a box of cereal that you purchased. And it isn\u2019t\njust the monetary stuff we\u2019re talking about: time, energy, moral\nobligations, all indication that the free-of-charge ideal simply\ncannot exist.\nDespair not, fellow travellers. I didn\u2019t imply that there\u2019s nothing out there that will help you save a few bucks when you\u2019re out\non the road. Combine a little bit of wit and resourcefulness, a\ndash of corporate promotional giveaways, plus a whack load of\ngenuine charity and hospitality, you might just have yourself a\nconcoction that will help you patch up that barrel of yours.\nAnd so we analyse some ways you can adapt to travel without\nhaving to casting a single penny.\nFREE Tours\nFREE Transport\nIf in desperation, cardboard boxes are always free. Though\nsleeping rough isn\u2019t something felix advocates. Well, not saying it isn\u2019t fun or eye-opening \u2013 well, I\u2019m drifting into a tangent\nnow. There are many online communities that offer to facilitate\nhouse swaps, couch lending etc. among travellers.\nCouchSurfing\nOh CouchSurfing (www.couchsurfing.org), that absolutely\nlegendary network that seems to hang on the tip of every\ntraveller\u2019s tongue. It is the non-profitable organisation\u2019s mission to connect travellers with locals, and judging by how\noften it dominates as topic of travel-related conversations\nsince founded in 2004, there is little doubt that it\u2019s a phe-nomal success.\nFor the benefit of those unfamiliar with CouchSurfing, it\nis a website where members host a traveller in their homes,\nand/or themselves being hosted by fellow members, by prior\nexchange and arrangement online. Bluntly, a free bed given\nthat you would provide likewise, though no such obligation\nis compulsory.\nVerdict:\nNobody can refuse a free bed. I do, however, avoid CouchSurfing due to the simple fact that I can\u2019t host anyone\n\u2013 sometimes moral obligations can be more demanding\nthan coerced cooperation. Some travellers may have trust\nissues and feel insecure in strangers\u2019 homes, which is un-derstandable. Another similar network worth considering\nis The Hospitality Club (www.hospitalityclub.org), which\ncame into existence in 2000 and is eponymously hospital-ity-themed. Being one of the older kids in the neighbourhood it has a more extensive database of members than\nCouchSurfing and is definitely worth your while.\nHike till you drop\nYou can always consider the option of walking. It certainly\nisn\u2019t the most appealing idea ever, though it does have immense\nhealth and spiritual benefits. Britt Das, who runs the charity\n\u2018Footprints for Freedom\u2019, walked from her native Netherlands\nto Tibet to raise awareness for world peace.\nOn the flip side, both physical prowess and mental toughness\nare tested. Cautionary tales include Matt Boyle\u2019s quest to trek\nfrom Bristol to India, whose journey fell short of completion\nwhen he gave up in Calais due to a \u2018language barrier\u2019.\nVerdict:\nToo much effort, says the Travel Editor, and infinitely\nunappealing to those who are slothful and unfit, both\ntraits that he possesses.\nHitchhiking\nYou know me: I cannot recommend this enough. Far from being a lost art, it\u2019s very much alive \u2013 not only does it exist as RAG\nor charity events, many hitchhikers hitch-hike as an ordinary\nmeans of getting from A to B. In Germany, for example, I had\nstumbled across Germans and foreigners (including myself)\nalike huddled in petrol stations and waving their thumbs in an\nattempt to get a lift.\nVerdict:\nIt\u2019s a wonderful way to get around. Your exposure to\nnew cultures, languages, customs will commence the\nmoment you hitch your first ride. The unpredictability\nof hitchhiking will be your supplier of free thrills, and\nthe sheer joy in creating friendships out of complete\nstrangers within fleeting encounters is, in all honesty,\noverwhelming.\nHere are the downsides: it\u2019s potentially dangerous, it\u2019s\nnot for the squeamish, and it certainly isn\u2019t for the freakishly pre-prepared.\nFREE Accommodation\nMany cities have tour companies that\noffer free tour, usually in an effort to\nentices customers with charismatic\nguides, animated presentations and\na more casual atmosphere in order to\nsell other priced services it offers.\nVerdict:\nA free tour is free, but then so is\nwandering down the street. A relatively petty gain. At least if you\nthink the tour guide as the charisma of a rotten carrot you won\u2019t\nfeel bad (to yourself) for leaving.\nIf the creditor is mortal manifestation of Death himself, then surely the credit\ncard is his scythe. For all the living inferno caused by the credit crunch, and the\nreckless spending they represent, which we as students strive to avoid like the\nplague, little wonder credit cards are generally dismissed solely as a means to\nburn money. Not if you look more closely at some of the benefits that come with\na card application, and manage your spending a little more wisely.\nGetting Air Miles\nMany frequent flyer programmes have affiliated credit cards that allow you\nto convert your daily spending into air miles, which can be used to redeem free\nflights, hotel rooms, etc. Additionally, some offer benefits to charm customers\ninto scrambling for an application form. While some cards require an annual\nfee, the ones we are concerning ourselves here are completely free-of-charge.\nIt is, however, important to compare to make sure you\u2019ve got the best deal.\nThe British Airways Amex Credit Card, for instance, gives away one BA Mile\nfor every \u00a31 spent, as well as 1000 BA Miles when you spend more than \u00a3500\nwithin the first three months of the membership. In contrast, the Lloyds TSB\nAirmiles Duo offers a 1500 mile voucher when you spend \u00a310 in the first two\nmonths, along with one mile for every \u00a310 spent. Nevertheless 1500 Lloyds TSB\nAirmiles is enough for redeeming two flights to a Zone 1 destination \u2013 Paris,\nAmsterdam and Dublin for instance \u2013 British Airways\u2019 equivalent of which\nwould demand a whooping 18,000 BA Miles.\nVerdict:\nPotentially shockingly good deals to be pocketed, though the research\nphase of the bargain-hunting isn\u2019t exactly effortless. And let\u2019s not forget the money that has to be spent before you start earning air miles.\nOversee with caution or the credit cards may turn out to be a financial\nburden.\nThere are many more ways to travel for\nfree than begging, stealing, and becoming an MP. Here are felixTravel\u2019s personal\nfavourites:\nTravel Writing\nThe Dream Job couldn\u2019t be spelt in another way: every avid traveller craves to\nwrite their way around the world.\nTruth is, it\u2019s a less profitable profession\nthan you think.\nWhile professional and freelance travel\nwriters are assumed to be travelling at the\nexpense of their newspaper or magazine\neditors, publications don\u2019t like subsidised\ntrips.Notonlybecausetheywouldhateto\npart with their cash \u2013 should the writers\nbe claiming expenses \u2013 they see a piece\nwritten by someone who has received\nfreebies as compromised and biased. Not\nsaying one\u2019s destined to be uncritical, but\nthat it happens.\nWith the rise of travel blogging, bloggers very often receive offers to review\nproducts free of charge.\nVerdict:\nA controversial one. The compulsion\nis that you write favourably to repaying the generosity of your client. Or\nyou can grow a conscience and see\nwhere that takes you.\nOn top of that, one major flaw: your\nwriting career will not take flight\nwhen you can\u2019t write to save your\nown life.\nVolunteering\nNot the pretentious CV-booster volunteering tourism that costs a grand. Thousands of non-profitable organisations\nare actively seeking extra hands and will\nhappily provide food and accommodation in exchange for a good day\u2019s work.\nMatadorNetwork has a list of ten volunteer opportunities that come with little\nor no cost (matadornetwork.com), which\nis a good starting point for searching for a\nreputable organisation to work with.\nVerdict:\nThis is what volunteerism is all\nabout, instead of slum excursions\noffered by hotels and unscrupulous,\nhighly profitable enterprises that\nhave more interest in beguiling than\nhelping those in need. Rather than\npaying for a tailor-made volunteering programme that is no different\nto a package holiday and offers little\nfreedom, enjoy the spontaneity and\nconfrontation with serendipity a\ngood programme brings. The incon-venience, of course, is finding one.\n\n"

Looking forward\nto a career in investment\nbanking? Young entrepreneur Yannick\nRoux offers a refreshing new perspective for business-minded students who\naren\u2019t quite ready to sell their souls to\nthe big banks.\nOn paper, Yannick seems to be\nshaped in the same mould as every\nother suit that speeds past you on a\nMonday morning. He\u2019s got a degree\nin Business Administration from Bocconi University in Milan and a Masters\nof Science in Accounting & Finance\nfrom LSE, and he worked at Macquarie Capital for two years - exactly two\nyears. He emphasises, \u201cI quit on the\nexact same day that they hired me two\nyears before\u201d. But it\u2019s quickly apparent\nthat behind the CV hides a person with\nthe courage to quit the rat race to make\nhis own way in the world, \u201cYou don\u2019t\nhave to follow the masses and do what\neveryone else is doing, because there is\nmore to life than investment banks.\u201d\nThere probably isn\u2019t anyone more\nqualified than Yannick Roux to offer\nthat advice. At the age of 25, he quit a\ncushy job at the Australian investment\nbank Macquarie to start his own business in an uncertain economy. Why\nwould anyone want to do that, I ask?\n\u201cIf you think about it rationally, if\nyou have a choice between starting up\na business and buying a lottery ticket,\nyou should always buy the ticket. But\never since I was an undergraduate, I\u2019ve\nwanted to run my own business. I did a\nsemester at Babson College in Boston,\nwhich is number one in Entrepreneurship. Every student at Babson had their\nown business and when I heard these\npeople talk about their businesses during class I got very excited. Since then\nI\u2019ve known that I did not want to work\nfor someone else.\u201d\nBut is it just about being your own\nboss? Surely you could work hard for\nthis or that promotion, become head of\nyour team, head of a particular division\nin this or that area, but for Yannick it\u2019s\nnot simply about having power, \u201cNo,\nit\u2019s about wanting to create something\nfrom scratch on your own. You know\nthe feeling? Wanting to be 100% responsible for it. Seeing something going from zero to somewhere is great.\u201d\nThis is probably why he seems so up-Ever thought about taking the plunge?\nKadhim Shubber interviews Likebees founder Yannick Roux about the risks and rewards of starting-up\nbeat as we\u2019re talking in the Union Quad.\nAfter years of dreaming Yannick finally\nlaunched Likebees.com in March with\nhis life-long best friend (\u201cWhether I\nwould strongly recommend it [part-nering with his best friend], I\u2019ll tell you\nin some more time.\u201d) The company\norganises heavily discounted deals on\notherwise expensive activities like Pilates classes, haircuts at top salons or\nmeals at fine restaurants by utilising\nthe power of mass-purchasing through\nits online community. If enough people buy into a deal, the deal is activated;\notherwise it\u2019s cancelled. The idea originated from the popular US-based website Groupon.\n\u201cAfter I left Macquarie I took a few\nmonths out to think about what I\nwould do. During my years at the bank\nYannick Roux has always had a passion for taking up exciting, new challeneges - a vital trait for budding entrepreneurs\n\u201c...rationally, if\nyou have a choice\nbetween starting\nup a business and\nbuying a lottery\nticket, you should\nalways buy the\nticket\u201c\n\u201canyone with an\ninternet connection\nhas got ideas, what\nmakes a business\nis how you execute\nyour ideas\u201c\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\nfollow the masses...\nthere is more to life\nthan investment\nbanks\u201c\nare commodities, anyone with a brain\nor an internet connection has got ide-as, what makes a business is how you\nexecute your ideas. How do you drive\ntraffic to your website in a smart way?\nHow do you create an engaged com-munity? How do you scale, and how do\nyou monetise that scale? We looked at\nGroupon and thought \u2018That\u2019s a clever\nbusiness model, you don\u2019t need a huge\nscale and it\u2019s easily monetisable. How\ncan we make it better?\u2019\nNowadays people are willing to share\neverything, they are on Facebook most\nof their time anyway. At the time we\nwere banking on the fact that we would\nbe the only ones doing this in London\nand in fact in Europe. So we thought,\nlet\u2019s do this now, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nBut in this new internet economy,\nYannick stresses, it is the technical\nspecialists, and not the businessmen\nwho have the edge. As he tells it, the\nguy who knows how to code his own\nwebsite is miles ahead of any Business\nStudies graduate.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve lacked is the technical\nbackground \u2013 how can this work? How\nlong will it take? I could never tell. I had\nno background in computer science so\nI always had to ask someone else. If I\ncould do my studies again, I would do\nsomething technical so if I had an idea\nI could spend one night doing a proto-type. Right now I have twenty ideas I\nwant to do but I cannot, because I do\nnot know how. If you can build your\nown ideas, all you have to do is spend a\nfew nights on it. And then you show it\nto people, get them excited about your\nproduct, see what they think. Right\nnow I cannot create something on my\nown. I have to pay people and so it is\nnot worth it and I do not do it. But if\nyou can do it yourself, then do it. The\nworst that could happen is that you\nspend two nights making something\nthat is not valuable. Otherwise, find\na technical co-founder who is willing\nto code in exchange for equity, but it\u2019s\nhard to excite developers with equity,\nthey like cash a lot more.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a long journey for Yannick\nand looking back, it\u2019s obvious that it\nhasn\u2019t been straightforward. Without\na clear idea of what he wanted to do,\nhe found himself buffeted and pressured by the storms of ambition at\nLSE, \u201cWhen I got there I still had no\nidea what I wanted to do. But everyone\nI saw had done applications to fifteen\nbanks. So I thought \u2018Wow, I must be\nlate for something.\u2019\u201d\nHe ended up following the crowd and\nheaded for the big banks like everyone\nelse, with limited success, \u201cI started\napplying to banks, for everything \u2013 I\napplied for derivatives, cash equi-ties, trading, IB... I had no clue what\nI wanted to do. I did some interviews\nwhere I got grilled, I didn\u2019t have any internships on my CV and of course the\nbanks like you a lot more if you\u2019ve been\nthere before.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint where exactly the young, perhaps na\u00efve Yannick\nRoux transformed into the confident\nentrepreneur he is today, but I suspect he was forged somewhere in the\nfurnace of his time as an investment\nbanker. \u201cYou do not have any time to\nthink about other things in life when\nyou work for an investment bank, you\nwork so hard that your brain is com-I compiled a long list of business ideas,\nboth online and offline. Given the size\nof our pockets, it was obvious to use the\ninternet because it\u2019s the least capital-intensive place to start. Obviously the\nrisk is that without a super-technical\nidea with a lot of IP [intellectual prop-erty], anyone can copy you. But ideas\n\n"

Meanwhile, questions are being raised over the\nconsequences if the Greek government does not meet austerity measures\ndemanded as a condition of the loans. European leaders insist that the\nloan package will be revoked if the agreed conditions are not met; how-ever, the EU\u2019s willingness to enforce such rules is unclear because no Euro\nmember has, to date, incurred penalties as should have happened under\nthe 1996 Stability Pact, an agreement that specifies rules and fines for\nEuro member government spending.

The company has\nprocured one third of the world\u2019s available dispersants and has already\ndeployed over 600,000 litres into the Gulf and on Wednesday announced\nthat it closed one of the three leak points, which is a significant milestone\nbut does not affect the rate of oil spillage. Komsomoloskaya Pravda,\nRussia\u2019s best-selling daily newspaper, published an article recommending that BP employ a Soviet-era tactic of closing the wells through the\ndetonation of atomic weapons.

The walls and ceiling will have\nexposed brick work and beams making the\nmost of the space we have available. The\nmain area also features booth seating which\nfaces towards the dancefloor and stage.\nThe dancefloor in Metric will be wooden to\ndistinguish the area from the rest of the club.\nThe stage will be raised with a permanent\nDJ booth behind it.

Again, the bar will be made\nof concrete and above the bar will also\nbe concrete. We hope to project onto the\nconcrete above the bar to show sports and\ntelevision programmes.\nBehind the bar will be new offices for the bar\nteam as well as a new large cellar which will\nservice all the bars across the entire venue.\nThere will also be a new kitchen designed for\nquicker service both at lunchtimes and in the\nevenings.\nA first look at your new bar and nightclub\n1.

You all dream about the lifestyle that money can buy you, but really,\nlet me tell you, it\u2019s not all about playing the high-roller at a posh club. Save money now so\nif one day you decide to start your business you will have the funds to do it; if you spend all\nyour salary, all you can do is keep running the rat race! Another good way to save money is\nusing Likebees.com.\nGo for it!\nIf you have ideas, go for it. If you do not do it now, you will always regret it. When you are\nthirty, you will think, \u201cWhy did I not do that when I was twenty?\u201d When I am thirty-five, I\nwill probably not leave a job to start my own business because by then I will have a family\nand so on. You either do it now or you forget about it. And find a co-founder, possibly with\na different set of skills.\nNetwork\nIf you go on meetup.com there are tons of events in London on any given area of business\nevery day. I was able to build a network in two months because I was in London. That\nis how I found the guy who developed the website. That is how I met some potential\ninvestors. You have to network. It is the best way to be aware of what is going in your\nindustry and meet the relevant people.\nIterate\nNowadays, when you set up a website, you need to iterate constantly with your customers.\nYou make a prototype, which might work, it might not work. Reid Hoffman, a famous\ninvestor and entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, once said that if you are not ashamed of your\nprototype, you have launched too late. If you can find ten people who like what you\u2019re\ndoing, they will help you get there. The best way to go is by iteration. Have a product, show\nit to your friends, get them to try it and love it, get feedback. Then go to investors.\nPlay the game\nIn the internet space, no one knows who the underdog is. You can look a lot bigger and\nmore organised than what you are; appearance plays a lot. Offline is similar: have nice\nlooking slides, flashy business cards, dress smartly.\nBut the other thing is you have to manage expectations. You can\u2019t bullshit. You get people\nto take you seriously by being honest. Particularly with clients. You want them to come\nback to you.\npletely washed out of everything else.\nSo your either burn out or make a\ndecision like mine. That is why they\npay so much and make you work so\nhard, because otherwise you would\njust leave. Money is a pain-killer. And\nthen obviously after the crash I realised\neven the financial rewards I expected\nwere not there. That\u2019s when my brain\nwent back to what I wanted to be do-ing. For example I really hated not being able to plan a holiday. Every time I\nmade plans, some big deal would happen that week by coincidence. The first\ntime was okay, the second time well\nokay, but after a while...\u201d\nHe trails off but the end of the sentence is obvious and refreshing, \u201c...after\na while, you quit the rat race and follow your dream of starting your own\nbusiness\u201d.\nSo after years of following the\ncrowds, and heading in the wrong di-rection, Yannick is finally the person\nthat he wanted to be all those years\nago during that life-changing semester at Babson College.\nHe runs his own company, he\u2019s creating something from the ground up\nand he\u2019s happy. \u201cIf I\u2019m up working\nuntil 3 or 4, it\u2019s okay. I decide, I could\njust go to bed. It\u2019s up to me.\u201d\nBut if it all doesn\u2019t work out, I ask,\ndoes he have a backup plan?\n\u201cYes, I do, but I\u2019m not doing this\nbecause I want to get rich; I\u2019m doing it because it is an experience. If\nit does not work, I will do something\nelse. If I run out of money, I\u2019ll find\nanother job and save as much money\nas possible to start my next business.\nAlthough at school they tell you that\nyou need a good, safe job \u2013 that is not\nall there is to life. I do not tell anyone to avoid investment banking, but\nmake sure you enjoy it and take time\nto think if it is what you really want\nto do with your life. If everyone is\ntelling you to go to Goldman Sachs,\nquestion it.\u201d\nWhat is Likebees all\nabout anyway?\nL\nikebees.com is a website that features discounted deals on things to\ndo in London (from restaurants to Pilates classes, from charity events\nto spas and hair salons). Deals run one at a time and for a limited period of time: if enough people buy before the deal ends, then everyone\ngets it, otherwise the deal is cancelled and no one is charged. And for\neach friend that you refer to Likebees, you can make \u00a35 in credit!\nCompetition Time\nLikebees is offering \u00a350 free credit to\ntwo lucky Imperial students. Simply go to\nhttp://imperial.likebees.com to qualify\nfor the competition\nYou can contact Yannick via @yanroux\non Twitter\n\n"

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\nThe events in Agora take place in 391\nA.D. as the sun starts to set on the\nRoman Empire. Christianity is gaining more and more power from the\npublic and the number of believers is\ngrowing exponentially every day. This\nmeans trouble for the pagans and the\natheists. As the Christians are growing\nin momentum and power, their hatred\ntowards other religions also grows. It\nappears the city of Alexandria will not\nbe a safe place unless the place is dominated by a single religion.\nAll of this sounds incredibly religion-heavy \u2013 a major downer. But fear not,\nfor Agora is not just about the religious\nconflicts. Director Amen\u00e1bar amazingly manages to include astronomy,\nphilosophy, geometry, mathematics\nand romance in the midst of the city\u2019s\nturmoil. The film\u2019s protagonist, Hypatia (Rachel Weisz), is an atheist philosopher and teacher who is forever\nfascinated by and is trying to figure out\nhow Earth fits into the solar system.\nShe has some rough ideas, but nothing\nis definite for sure. She has love inter-ests, Orestes (Oscar Isaac), her student\nand Davus (Max Minghella), her slave,\nbut she is far too busy to address them.\nShe does notice them but her love towards them is strictly platonic: a true\nWitness the fall of classical antiquity\nDirector Alejandro Amenabar\nScreenwriter Mateo Gil\nCast Rachel Weiz, Max Minghella,\nOscar Issac\nAgora\nJohnPark\nJohnPark\nphilosopher, she is focused solely on\nher research and her academia.\nThe hefty number of Goyas (Span-ish equivalent of the Oscars) won by\nthe technical departments of the film\ngoes to show that one of the biggest\naccomplishments of Agora lies in the\nspecial effects, cinematography, cos-tume, make-up, and production design crews. They have all been justly\nawarded and it\u2019s easy to marvel at the\nendless technical achievements. Agora\nimmediately turns into a visual treat,\nwith the flawless, epic recreation of Alexandria, recapturing the city in all its\nglory initially, but later, in its decline.\nThe details are hard to ignore and the\ngrandness of it all is a dazzling view.\nCrucial events occur in the biggest\nplaces, the library of Alexandria, the\ntown square etc, and they are sights to\nbehold. The sacking of the Alexandria\nlibrary carried out by the Christians\nwho drive out the pagans from the\nlibrary is handled with perfectly controlled pace. There is enough speed to\nbuild up plenty of tension and a strong\nsense of urgency but it\u2019s never rushed\npast, the camera does linger in certain\nplaces to give the audience the maximum amount of detailed, vivid drama,\nand a chance for the excellent musical\nscore to thrive.\nAmen\u00e1bar is a big fan of using aerial\nshots and he uses them in all the right\nmoments. And with these shots, he\ncan show the spectacularly rebuilt city\nof Alexandria in one big sweep, as well\nas the large crowds of people flowing\nin and out of the city that closely resemble little bugs swarming the place,\nwhich is a truly exhilarating visual ex-perience. The struggles surrounding\nKicks - two girls, one footballer\nDirector Lindy Heymann\nScreenwriter Leigh Campbell\nCast Nichola Burley, Kerrie Hayes,\nJaimie Doyle\nKicks\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nEmerging from Liverpool after the\ncity\u2019s stint as European Capital of Culture, Kicks is a dark slow drama delving into the world of celebrity obses-sion. And I mean slow, the snailpace of\nthis film drags out its bare plot to the\npoint of exasperation.\nNichola Burley, last seen viciously\nseeking revenge in Donkey Punch,\nslips easily into the role of Jasmine,\ndesperate to fulfil her dream of marrying a footballer and getting her \u2018tits\u2019\ndone. After meeting Nicole (newcom-er Kerrie Hayes), the two girls bond\nover their love for Liverpool United\nsuperstar Lee Cassidy (Jamie Doyle).\nCue endless shots of the mottled concrete that infests Merseyside as the\ngirls stalk their idol at his home and\nclub.\nLee is deliberately played with all\nthe arrogant unpleasantness you\u2019d\nexpect of a Premiereship footballer\nwho finds himself on the wrong side\nof the girls affections, when a transfer\nto Madrid is approved. At the heart of\nthe film lies the relationship between\nthe girls, whose worship of the celebrity footballer arises due to broken\nfamilies. The shy Nicole is portrayed\nrather brilliantly by Hayes, whose delicate innocence is caused by the absence of her parents whereas Jasmine\nis showered with money and clothes\nbut finds comfort with Nicole that her\ncrass parents can never offer.\nUnfortunately the performances are\nlet down by the story which never really amounts to anything. It is at times\npainful to watch the plot meander towards the predictable climax which is\nwhere the film breaks down, the writers apparently not sure what to do.\nThe soundtrack is provided by the\nScouse electro pop outfit Ladytron\nwhich makes up for some of the originality lacking in the film. Kicks has it\u2019s\nfaults but it has many strong points\ntoo, especially in the rising stars of\nNichola Burley and Kerrie Hayes. Essentially it\u2019s a flawed fable about the\ndangers of celebrity culture.\nthe different religions are given the extra dramatic push with the wonderful\ncamerawork and music. Massacres are\nnever easy to watch but they\u2019re even\nmore disturbing to watch when they\nhappen repeatedly; Amen\u00e1ba doesn\u2019t\ngo overboard though, so they never\nget boring.\nThe action is handled well by much\ntechnical flourish, but the rest is up\nto the actors. Weisz is on fine form as\nusual as the intelligent, independent\nwoman who craves knowledge more\nthan anything else in the world. She\nis an atheist, and this does inevitably\nland her into trouble, but she is not\na weak-spirited person. She is headstrong and brave, qualities Weisz portrays beautifully. Minghella, the slave,\ntherefore creating the forbidden love\nsubplot, is also hugely effective. The\nfrustration and confusion his character experiences as he finds himself\ntorn between religion and his eternal\nlove for a woman he never will be\nable to have for himself are well established by the young actor\u2019s\nexceptional performance.\nHe doesn\u2019t have a lot\nof dialogue and relies\non his body movements to do the\nacting, a method\nthat pays off immensely due to his\ntalent. Yet another\nstand-out here is\nIsaac, playing the\ncharacter that completes the love trian-gle. He\u2019s a slimy, arrogant student to start with\nbut his character changes: his affection towards Hypatia remains but\nas he gets older he turns into a man of\nslightly more insight and intelligence,\na change that is convincingly showed\nthroughout by Isaac.\nAgora is a stirring, epic journey that\ntakes us to unique places and explores\nfascinating characters who get caught\nup in extraordinary events. It certainly is a welcome return from the always\nmasterful Amen\u00e1bar who can bring\nout all sorts of heart-wrenching emotions with the\nhelp of his\ntalented cast\nand crew.\nAncient\nhistory\nhas never\nlooked so\ngood.\ngent, independent\ns knowledge more\nin the world. She\nhis does inevitably\nble, but she is not\nrson. She is head-ualities Weisz por-Minghella, the slave,\nthe forbidden love\ngely effective. The\nonfusion his char-as he finds himself\nion and his eternal\nhe never will be\nimself are well es-young actor\u2019s\nformance.\nlot\nies\ne-e\nm-an-arro-art with\nchanges: his af-out all sorts of heart\nwrenching emo\ntions with\nh th\nhelp of hi\ntalented\nd cas\nand cr\nrew\ne\nAncient\nt\nhistory\nhas neve\nlooked s\ngood.\nThe explosive trailer for Machete has just gone up on\nthe internet. A bit ironic when you consider that the\nfilm is based on a fake trailer itself. Oh well, feast your\neyes on this impressive cast - Dany Trejo, Michelle\nRodriguez, Cheech Marin, Jessica Alba, Steven Seagal\nand Robert de Niro! Robert Rodriguez has promised\nthis film is going to be pure Mexploitation. Watch the\ntrailer now at http://bit.ly/bfBG0n\n\n"

Intel\u2019s Light Peak\nThe World Cup in HD\nThe World Cup is coming and it\u2019s only\n34 days away! That\u2019s 32 of the best\nteams from around the world, battling it out over 30 days, through group\nstages and knockout games, all to get\ntheir hands on that elusive golden tro-phy. That\u2019s a lot of quality football, and\nthis year we\u2019ll get the chance to see the\nwhole lot in glorious HD.\nMeh, I hear you say. Why would I\nwant to see football in HD? What possible benefit is it to football? Well, I\ncould bang on about how HD has up\nto 5 times the level of detail of SD,\nand that it\u2019s broadcast with a Dolby\nDigital sound track, but I\u2019m not going\nto hit you over the head with that old\nrhetoric.\nHD-ready or Full HD, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou\u2019re watching an HD broadcast. But\nit\u2019s an easy and relatively painless upgrade for most, now that Freeview has\ngone HD. For those of us in London,\nthe Freeview service that you know\nand love began broadcasting in HD in\nDecember of last year. Unfortunately\nto receive the HD channels, BBC HD,\nITV HD and Channel 4 HD, you\u2019ll have\nto either buy a new TV with Freeview\nHD built-in or buy a new Freeview HD\nreceiver. Similar to the Freeview boxes\nthat were bought to receive the digital\nfree-to-air service in the beginning,\nthese Freeview HD boxes pick up both\nSD and HD channels using only your\nTV aerial. If you\u2019re in London you\u2019ll\nhave to have your TV aerial pointed\nat Crystal Palace, which most already\nwill be, so once you plug the box into\nit and your TV, you\u2019re set. A Freeview\nHD box will cost somewhere in the\nregion of \u00a3100 to \u00a3180, with Freeview\nHD PVRs starting at about \u00a3250. There\nis one caveat however, if you live in a\nblock of flats, the internal aerial feed\nmay be filtered causing problems\nwith the HD broadcasts. If you think\nyou might have this problem, buy a\nFreeview HD box from a retailer that\noffers refunds if it won\u2019t work for you.\nOf course Freeview HD, although\nthe most recent service to introduce\nHD broadcasting, isn\u2019t the only way to\nThere are only 34 days left till kick off. Are you and your TV ready?\nget the World Cup in HD. The other\nfree-to-air service FreeSat HD, a partnership between the BBC and ITV,\ncurrently offers BBC HD and ITV HD,\nwith other HD channels promised in\nthe next couple of years. As the name\nimplies, FreeSat uses a satellite dish to\npull down its signal, which is great if\nyou happen to be living in a place with\na Sky dish or other digital satellite dish\non the roof. Whether you\u2019re thinking of\ngetting rid of your Sky service or want\nto put up a new satellite dish, FreeSat\ncarries loads of free-to-air channels as\nwell as HD offerings. To take advantage of FreeSat HD, you again need an\nHD capable FreeSat box, which starts\nat around \u00a3100 or an HDTV with FreeSat HD built-in. FreeSat HD PVRs are\nalso available and they start around the\n\u00a3250 mark.\nIf you want more channels than the\nfree-to-air services provide, then you\nmight want to look at the various subscription services that are available.\nIf you\u2019re in a cable area then you can\ntake advantage of Virgin Media\u2019s HD\npackages with a V HD box costing you\na one off fee of \u00a349 or free on the TV\nXL package. You then pay for one of\nthe Virgin Media TV packages, which\nrange from \u00a311.50 to \u00a329 without a\nVirgin phone line. Virgin Media also\noffer a HD PVR box called the V+ HD,\nwhich also costs \u00a349 but has a \u00a35 per\nmonth extra service fee attached to it.\nThe venerable Sky also offers HD\npackages with the UK\u2019s largest selection of HD channels. Sky HD is available in a dizzying plethora of options,\npackages and charges starting with\nthe \u00a328 Sky+HD starter. That includes\n2Mb broadband as well, although you\u2019ll\nhave to have a BT phone line to take\nadvantage of it. That\u2019ll give you the all\nimportant BBC HD and ITV HD channels among others.\nAnd finally, if none of that\u2019s possible,\nyour budget\u2019s a bit tight perhaps, then\nyour best bet is to find yourself a pub\nwith the games in HD, or take beers\nround to your mates place and camp in\nfront of his massive HDTV.\nEye-bleeding\ndetail abound\nH\nD, it\u2019s the future and it\u2019s\nhere now! Or is 3D the\nfuture? Why not 3DHD?\n3DHD on your 52\u201d OLED\nFreeviewHD TV. What a mouthful,\nand it looks like it\u2019s only going to get\nworse in the near future with all sorts\nof new acronym-brandishing technologies on their way.\nIt\u2019s not all bad though, because presumably one day HD won\u2019t be high-definition any more, once everything is\nHD. At that point we\u2019ll get 4KHD; four\ntimes the eye-bleeding detail of regular\nHD. We already have cameras recording things in 4K and even 8K, but that\u2019s\na good thing, because once the relentless onward march of technology gets\nthose kinds of displays into our homes,\nwe\u2019ll already have the content available\nto make them shine. The BBC and alike\nhave been recording things with HD\ncameras for years, which is why you can\nget the old, yet still digitally recorded\nprograms in HD now.\nBlu-Ray has been making ground in\nrecent months, having shown a relatively lacklustre adoption after \u2018winning\u2019\nthe format war with HD-DVD. Blu-Ray\nmight be the last of its kind however,\nif Microsoft and others have their way.\nGone will be the physical discs of yes-terday, and in will be the newfangled\nsuper-highspeed super-mega-turbo-ul-tra connections and their instant down-loads. Problem is Britain\u2019s certainly not\ngoing to be ready for it if we go along\nwith what government calls \u2018highspeed\ninternet\u2019\n. That\u2019s 2Mbit \u2018broadband\u2019 if\nyou didn\u2019t know. My cellphone gets\nthat kind of bandwidth and honestly, I\nthink it\u2019s practically crawling. What will\n2Mbit be like in the future, or even 2012\nfor that matter? The internet with the\nhand brake on I\u2019m guessing.\nBut what is government expected to\ndo? Especially in this economic climate?\nIn all honesty, I don\u2019t know. I hope companies like Virgin Media and BT, pile the\ninvestment in, to get us truly connected\nin the Gbps realm, at least in major cit-ies. You can\u2019t expect a company that has\nto make money to fork out a boat load\nto make sure Fred living on his country\nestate is connected. The digital divide\nmight end up evolving into the high-speed divide in the modern interconnected world.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week in tech has flown by\nwhilst the majority of you have been\nfighting your way through exams. So\nlet\u2019s have a quick recap to see what you\nmight have missed in a pretty much\nApple free week.\nIntel\u2019s been busy this week with two\nseparate announcements the first of\nwhich we\u2019ve talked about in felix be-fore: Light Peak. If you remember,\nLight Peak is Intel and Apple\u2019s shot at\nUSB3 using the power of light. Yes, as\nthe name suggests, Light Peak pumps\ndata down optical fibres, as well as the\nmore traditional copper variety. This\nweek Intel showed off a laptop kit-ted out with the optical technology,\nretrofitted into a regular USB cable.\nThe demonstration unit pumped two\nsimultaneous HD streams down one\ncable without even a stutter. According\nto Intel, the initial 10Gbps bandwidth\nLight Peak will be capable of is only\nthe beginning, with trillions of bits per\nsecond theoretically possibly over optical fibre. If Intel and Apple get their\nway, Light Peak could end up replacing almost every type of connection;\ndisplays, data, networking, everything.\nIntel also announced this week that\nwe could have smartphones with \u201810\ndays of standby time\u2019, thanks to its\nAtom Z-series of processors. Previously known as Moorestown, Intel hopes\nthe Atom Z will enable it to get a proper foothold in the smartphone market\ncurrently dominated by ARM based\nchips like Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon.\nTen days worth of standby time is apparently achievable by only switching\non those parts of the chip that are required at any one time; a bit like only\nswitching on the lights in the room\nyou\u2019re in. Intel also showed a prototype\nAtom Z-packing phone running Quake\n3 at 100fps, which is way too fast to actually play, but impressive nonetheless.\nIntel\u2019s making some bold claims how-ever, and faces an uphill battle against\nthe extremely efficient and moderately\npowerful ARM competitors.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor Dr. Andre Ng became the first cardiologist to use a robot to complete a remote heart operation, at the Glenfield\nHospital in Leicester this week. By using a robot, cardiac surgeons can avoid\nthe cumulative effects of exposure to\nX-rays, which are used to monitor the\nprogress of the operation. \u2018As long as\nthe connection\u2019s reliable, the operation\ncould be performed from anywhere in\nthe world\u2019, Dr. Ng was quoted as saying.\nIs this the future of surgery, since brain\nsurgery and a kidney transplant have\nalready been performed using robots?\nAnd finally, those 3D specs you got\nwith your 3DTV could work fine with\nyour mates incompatible 3DTV, just\nby turning them upside down. Apparent incompatibility solved. Format war\naverted. Absurdity inevitable.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nThen why not check out the\nUK\u2019s weekly tech podcast\nbrought to you by two\nImperialites and a Bulgarian.\nTheWrapSheetPodcast\nAvailable on iTunes or at\nwww.thewrapsheet.co.uk\nCan\u2019t get enough tech news?\n\u201ceverything that\u2019s\nexciting about\nfootball is pin sharp\nand in exquisite\ndetail\u201d\nWhat does HD mean for the World\nCup? Watching the World Cup in HD\nis about as close as most of us are going to get to actually being there. The\ncolours are vibrant and rich, the crowd\nroars as if you were there whilst the\nplayers dance their skilful moves now\nshown in incredible clarity allowing\nyou to see exactly what they\u2019re doing.\nAnd the goals; every curve of the ball;\nevery swerve in the air; the rebounds,\nthe deflections, everything that\u2019s exciting about football, is pin sharp and in\nexquisite detail.\nOK, OK, it sounds awesome. How do\nI get it? I have an HDTV, I already have\nit right? Contrary to popular belief,\njust because you might have an HDTV,\nHold still a minute will you?\n\n"

Why was this? Well it was because from that day onwards a large\nproportion of European airspace was\nclosed off, resulting in the cancellation\nof flights. Of course, you know all this\nalready. After all, it happened in the\nmiddle of the Easter break when you\nwere deep in revision (may still be) and\noccasionally heard the odd snippet of\nnews about Gordon Brown slagging\noff a pensioner for not liking how the\ndemographic of her town was deterio-rating. OK, so the volcano itself is old\nnews, but what was the timescale and\nwhat actually happened? Is it even still\ngoing off?\nEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull has erupted frequently since the last Ice Age. The Icelandic Meteorological Office published\ndata in December which indicated\nan increase in residual seismic activity around the area during the years\n2006\u20132009, culminating in December\n2009 with thousands of small earthquakes detected (of magnitude 1\u20132\nMw) This most recent major eruption\n(April 14th) has not come out of the\nblue, as many people have suggested.\nIt still rages, too. Whilst the situation\nwith the airspace - as far as most people care - became much more relaxed\nin Britain on April 20th, the ash still\nremains ( it has been suggested that we\neven saved 200,000 tonnes per a day of\nCO2 emissions as a result of cancelled\nflights). As recently as the 4th May, a\nfresh plume was pushed 5.5km into\nthe air. As a result of this massively dynamic situation, local airspace restrictions are being applied and removed\nconstantly.\nA Volcano erupted a wee while back...\nNathan Ley\nNathan Ley Science Editor Now this all sounds reasonable, and\nshould offer a nice amount of context\nto put the headlines in to.\nHowever, there are problems with\nmodern media and the associated hys-teria. As far as I\u2019m concerned, very little fundamental information has been\nconveyed to the people. Sure, we heard\nfrom a lot of people who\u2019s flight from\nBarcelona back to Manchester was\ncancelled, and they were \u201cABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED!!!\u201d We even heard\nfrom a sober Scotsman who screamed\n\u201cI HATE ICELAAAAAND\u201d down the\ncamera. Well that\u2019s nice for you mate\nbut seriously? Volcanoes are as much\na part of life as me or you. They are a\nproduct of having a planet based on a\nmolten core.\nThe eruptions were not, as some\npeople have suggested, \u2018an act of god\u2019.\nAn act of God means nothing. It was\nbad enough that the media threw this\nphrase around, but worse is that this\nis the same wafer thin defence behind\nwhich faceless insurance companies\nhave sat, in an attempt to avoid major\npayouts to customers.\nProfessor Brian Cox recently gave\nhis opinion on that matter, in a more\nrational manner. He said \u201cNext time\nyou get upset because you can\u2019t get\nstrawberries or asparagus, remember\nthat without volcanoes there would be\nno atmosphere on this planet,\u201d And he\nSpectacular scenes at Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull light up the night sky\n\u201cEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull has\nerupted frequently\nsince the last Ice\nAge\u201d\nRotting fish could give scientists an\ninsight into how to interpret some of\nthe oldest and most important fossils.\nBy finding patterns in rotting fish, a\ngreater understanding of fossilised sea\ncreatures can be gained. The study revealed how primitive marine creatures\nmay have changed as they decayed.\nThe researchers have identified certain particular patterns of deterioration that should help scientists identify\nvery early marine fossils more accu-rately. Dr Rob Sansom from the University of Leicester, who led the study,\nsaid that fossil examination is similar\nto forensic analysis. \u201cUnlike forensics,\nhowever, we are dealing with life from\nmillions of years ago,\u201d he said.\n\"What we want to get at is what an\nanimal was like before it died and, as\nwith forensic analysis, knowing how\nthe decomposition that took place after death altered the body provides important clues to its original anatomy.\"\nThis is most important for animals\npreserved as soft tissue remains, the\ncase for some of the earliest creatures\nin the fossil record. These are marine\ncreatures that lived up to 500 million\nyears ago. The earliest known chordates had no skeleton but luckily in\nrare conditions their soft bodies were\nfossilised and preserved partially in-tact. The researchers were hoping to\n110\nThe number of millions of cubic\nmetres of tephra ejected during the\neruption of the 14th April\n500\nThe age (in millions of years) of\nthe earliest marine creatures that\nmaintained their skeletons\n1\nThe number of times the study has\nbeen cited in new research, since it\u2019s\npublication in January 2010\nfind out how the forms of the animals\nhave changed during decay, between\ndeath and fossilisation.\nDr Mark Purnell, a member of the\nstudy, explained that this involved\n\"some very unpleasant experiments\".\nHe and his colleagues studied some\nprimitive marine vertebrates, including lampreys.\nThey also examined some close relatives of vertebrates. The dead creatures\nwere placed in clear containers and they\nwatched how each specimen changed\nas it rotted. The team discovered that\nsome of the defining characteristics\nused by biologists to identify fossils\nwere fundamentally altered by decay.\nFeatures including the muscular patterns and shapes changed dramatically\nduring decomposition. Now traced,\nthese changes and patterns can be used\nby scientists to better interpret some of\nthe most ancient marine fossils.\n\"We need to understand how they\ndecayed if we're going to put them in\nthe right place in the tree of life,\" said\nDr Purnell. \"The work doesn't appeal\nto everyone, but it's worth the effort.\"\nat work that are, quite simply, greater\nthan any possible man-made con-struction.

Perhaps this may seem an everyday occur-rence. (Certainly, to a grocer, the citric\norb perched nearby must be a veritable\nleitmotif (or rather life motif)). But I\nsensed a certain kinship, the orange and\nI, regarding each other silently over the\nhalf written page.\nFor Oranges may not be the only\nfruit, but proud, as I am, to be amongst\nthe ranks of those not providing evidence of that particular aphorism, I can\nstand up for the oranges. Conventional\nhe may be in these days of jet-setting\nex-patting exoticism, and I must admit,\nthe orange is no pineapple. It\u2019s a fruit\nwhich says, have fun kids, but keep safe.\nThe frivolity of the moderate bourgeois\nif you will. I aim to live up to the or-ange, spitting forth a similar sweet and\nzesty piquancy and leaving pithy lines\nbetween your teeth.\nBut as I watched the orange, we\nseemed no longer so close, what I\nhad perceived as our shared function,\nturned out to be no more than a tan-gent, and while I could aspire to become a tan gent, the orange would be\ntango before my tan went. This bright\nsphere, cousin of the fabled fruit in the\ntrees below the Beatles\u2019 marmalade\nskies, would dream instead of marmalade \u2018pi\u2019s, just half of which will send\neven the merest tan of tangerine to infinity and back.\nThe orange does, however, have\nsomething in common with the three\ncandidates for prime minister, who\nby now have reached the end of their\nelectoral race. I allude not to their waxy\nskin, their shiny image or their potential for acidic disappointment, but instead to their excellently smooth chins.\nFor not one of the leaders of Britain\u2019s\nthree main political parties sports a\nbeard.\nThe beard, considered a masculine\nessential in a great many societies, but\nreviled in others, has been entirely out\nof fashion, and certainly out of political\nfashion for many years now.\nThis election begs to differ though,\npoliticians more divided over missiles\nthan bristles on which they stand cheek\nto closely shorn cheek (or maybe chic).\nAll this is the explanation for my advice\nnot to abandon your shaving-ism as\nyou might your chauvinism.\nYet I must admit a certain sadness\nas the election campaign stops like a\nspeeding ballot, leaving maybe only a\nweek of political speculation. I will miss\nthe intense commentary, for election\ntime is when everyone has their say,\nespecially in these days of Twitter and\nreinstated status of status (forget cars\nand clothes, smileys are the new status\nsymbols). I think it\u2019s glorious to know\nthat the comments are being written,\ntirelessly, again and again, this is what\nreal social commentary is made of! Given my penchant for roomy ruminations\nand attractive tracts, it\u2019s been a nice va-riety. By next week we will be back to\nthe usual few common-tators, but for\nnow, my heart pounds to the pitter-patter of a tinny beat, the key strokes of\nstroke keys and the fingers tapping on\nthe thinking man\u2019s drumkit.\nJoyBalmercompares the PM with oranges\n\u201cI allude not\nto their waxy\nskin, their shiny\nimage or their\npotential for acidic\ndisappointment...\u201d\nA\nfter years of labour, the\nagonising gestation period\nis finally over. We have had\nrisks of abnormalities and\ncomplications, moments\nof crisis and panic, but at last the great\nMother Democracy has brought forth\na leader, still covered in amniotic fluid\nand wailing in shock, into the arms of a\nproud and expectant public.\nAs of last night you are the lucky owners of a bouncing baby Prime Minister.\nAnd yes, it\u2019s a boy. Let the bells ring out,\nthe trumpets blare, and the wine pour\nforth like ash from a dyspeptic volcano.\nDeck Ed Balls with boughs of holly and\nhave George Osborne dipped in gold\nand sold as a commemorative figurine.\nHow relieved you must be that the\nelection worked out as it did. I know I\nam very happy for you. And I am also\nincredibly glad that the whole sensational and sensationalist mess is behind\nus. I think it only fair of me to point out\nthat I don\u2019t have an English passport \u2013 I\ngave it up for Lent. But seeing as I live in\nyour country and nap in the dark corners of your universities, I feel it would\nbe rude of me not to take an interest in\nthe internal rumblings of the British political stomach. It would be like a lodger\nin a provincial bed and breakfast taking no notice of a fire in the bathroom\nunless it singed his bowels. Sorry, that\nshould be towels.\nBut, as I believe you say in this coun-try, my tongue is not yet suited to your\nmother. My ears flap helplessly in the\nwind broken by your rapid speech, and\nI often find myself incapable of understanding your iron railings against au-thority. Or should that be ironic?\nSmall wonder, then, that I should\nhave such trouble understanding a\nword familiar to the meanest intellects\nthe length and breadth and width and\nheight and depth of your remarkably\npointy country. If you will pardon me to\nask, what is meant (a thousand apologies for disturbing your peace) by this\nword \u2018Change\u2019?\nYour well-known Face Book (written,\nI believe, by William the Conqueror in\nan attempt to catalogue the facial features of the Anglo-Saxon race), is not\nparticularly helpful. \u201cIf David Cameron\nwants Change so badly,\u201d it suggests,\n\u201cgive him 30p and tell him to fuck off.\u201d\nNot only does this seem a disrespectful\nway to address a man who is/was/will\nbe leader of the country/a politician\nwith a face best remembered as having launched a thousand memes, but it\ndoesn\u2019t make a great deal of sense.\nIs this the sort of Change that Cameron wanted? The Change that Nick\nClegg so passionately campaigned for?\nThe Change that Gordon Brown desperately claimed he could bring? Who\nknows. All I can say for certain is that\nI was as fed up with having \u2018Change\u2019\nflung in my direction from posters,\nbroadcasts, leaflets and newspapers as\nI am with having change flung at me\nby shopkeepers, vending machines, bus\ndrivers and rich passers-by who tell\nme not to spend it on drink.\nGeneral elections are a fun and exciting break from the monotony of\ndaily politics. They provide clean\nwholesome fun for all the family, and\nusually come with a five year money-back guarantee. They are also, paradoxically enough, among the most depressing times to be a member of the\ngeneral public.\nI dislike being taken for an idiot.\nAs discussed at some length above I\nam not English, so I am averse to presuming as to your own feelings on the\nsubject. But few things have annoyed\nme more about this national campaign\nthan the blanket assumption rolled\nacross the country and tucked in at\nDover that the public can\u2019t think for\nitself.\nBy the time you read this one of the\nguys who will cut taxes and implement change in ways eerily similar to\nand yet utterly different from the other\ntwo guys will have won. Coalitions will\nbe discussed, political careers will end,\nand the embarrassing business of campaigning will be forgotten.\nAnd now that _____ ______ is contentedly playing with a slinky down the\nstaircase of Number 10 (it is left as an\nexercise to the reader to fill in the gaps\nin the preceding clause), it does seem a\nlittle churlish to dwell on the past few\nfrenetic weeks. The birth of a baby\nis, after all, the sign that friends and\nwell-wishers can finally release months\nof pent-up emotion and go to buy it\nclothes.\nAnd so I should, by rights, be picking\nout the tiny onesies of expectation and\nthe matching bonnets of hope for our\nbeloved newborn. At the same time,\nmy arms should overflow with the nappies of cynicism, ready to mop up the\ncopious doo-doo that your national\nbaby will doubtless be emitting.\nNext time, have a look at birth\ncontrol.\nGileadAmit isn\u2019t convinced by UK politics\n\u201cFew things have\nannoyed me more\nthan the blanket\nassumption that\nthe public can\u2019t\nthink for itself.\u201d\n\n"

Well, my\nfriends, he is. He managed to get into\na brawl last friday over this paper.

Enough of him.\nMy week has been a little different to\nnormal, been in quite high spirits to be\nhonest. However, last Monday morning I was coming in to College on my\nmotorbike for an early morning revision session. Being a bank holiday, sunny and about 8.30am I was gunning it,\nValentino Rossi stylie. This was to be\nthe main downfall, as Rossi has a bike\ndesigned to be ridden fast. Me, not so\nmuch. Coming up to my favourite turn\nI decide to nail it. First mistake. The\nfoot peg dug into the road, lifted up the\nback wheel and spat me down the road.\nUsing all my sense, I decided to hang\nonto the bike to stop it getting too\ndamaged. However all I really succeeded in doing was damaging myself more\nas I slid down the road, face down, still\nholding the handlebars. At this point\nI was pretty sure I looked spectacular.\nOnce the bike (with me still attached)\ncame to a halt, I picked it up, forgetting to pull the clutch in. Second mis-take. The bike lurched forward, and\nI, right in front of my newly founded\nstunt fan club, once again preceded to\nfall over with the bike on top of me. At\nthis point I was just embarrassed. It\u2019s\none thing to practise a fast dismount,\nbecause it can be useful in situations\nwhere you are being chased by a gang\nof hoodies, maybe. But falling over like\na toddler who\u2019s just learning to walk is\nmore embarrassing that watching Dan\nWan fight.

Always.\nBecause it\u2019s really cool to create a new\nharmony with the vocal line. With the\nsame vocals melody you can create\nso many different atmospheres. Our\nfavourite remixes are the \u201cpop\u201d ones.\nNot club. We love to do something soft\nand very pop. Unexpected. For exam-ple, check our remix of Telepathe or\nour remix of Adam Kesher.

From Etienne de Crecy,\nIsol\u017de, Harvard Bass and Siriusmo.\nClassy remixers, we are very proud.\nYou\u2019re taking part in the Oui Love\nExchange Tour which will make people more aware of some of the latest\nFrench acts. Apart from Daft Punk\nand Air, what other artists would\nyou recommend in order to rid our\nignorance of French music? Why do\nyou think that there is such a lack of\nFrench musicians in the mainstream\ncharts in the UK?\nBecause you\u2019re Racist! Hahaha, seri-ously, I think (I hope) that it\u2019s changing step by step. Before, the famous\nFrench artists were only in electronic\nmusic, like Daft Punk. But since the\nsuccess of Phoenix, we\u2019ve begun to\nbe good at pop music and rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\nThe Shoes are playing in\nLondon at the Mac Beth\non the 14th of May, get\nyour shoes on and go see\nthem!\nAnd there are a lot of good bands right\nnow. If before the French weren\u2019t in the\nUK it was because they were not good\nenough I guess.\nAs an artist, what do you think\nmakes a good gig? How do you\ntry to distinguish yourselves from\nother bands in the live scene in order to make sure that the audience\nwalk away knowing they have had a\nunique \u201cThe Shoes\u201d experience?\nThe Oui Love tour will be the first time\nwe\u2019ll play our new live show. Before, we\nwere in a kind of \u201celectronic DJ\u201d per-formance. A dance music act. Now we\nwant to show what our record is. So we\nplay a lot of crazy keyboard, we sing,\nthere are even soft songs. It\u2019s gonna be\nthe \u201cpop\u201d side of The Shoes. The side\nwe prefer at the moment.\nSo we are very excited!\nInterview by Lily Le\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWhen Metric is finished and does what we hope,\nit\u2019s certainly going to be competitive as a venue\nto [LSE and King\u2019s Union]. I have no problem with\nadvertising it to other universities\u201d\nbut that\u2019s pretty much the vaguest answer you can give.\u201d He\u2019s right. It\u2019s the\nvagueness that most final year Imperial students will exude when asked.\nBoth his background in Biology and\nhis environmental policy work with\nthe Liberal Democrats means there\nmay be a green agenda coming for the\nUnion.\n\u201cThe Union\u2019s environmental policy\nruns out at the end of the year. I\u2019ll be\nworking over the summer to renew\nthat, with hopefully some additions.\nSome presidents have concentrated on\nthe environmental agenda, but not all\nof them,\u201d he states before explaining\nhow he intends to change the system\nby which clubs and societies travel\nacross the globe on tours to be more\nenvironmentally-friendly.\nThe system is way over my head, but\nit\u2019s evident it\u2019s a personal concern, especially since he\u2019s Chair of Fellwanderers society this year. It is not uncommon to see Alex throwing hiking gear\ninto the back of a minibus on Prince\nConsort Road come Friday afternoon,\nas he prepares for a weekend trip to the\nwild stretches of the county. If working in politics for a year wasn\u2019t the\npre-cursor to becoming Union President, it\u2019s his active involvement with a\nsociety that has produced two Sabbatical officers for next year: himself and\nDeputy President of Clubs & Societies\nHeather Jones.\n\u201cThe Fellwanderers showed me that\nthe Union is about developing students\u2019 lives in all the areas that College\ncannot, be that through Sport, learning a new skill, or learning more about\nyourself. I think that we lose that perspective sometimes, that it is here and\nnow that matters more than the future.\nI love that about the Union, which is\nwhy I wanted to be a part of it.\u201d\nAs great as it to see someone who\nhas picked up an interest such as\nFellwandering at university and run\nwith it, there are many more who just\nhaven\u2019t. The lack of involvement many\nstudents have shown has been down to\nthe \u2018general apathy\u2019 that exists at Imperial, and Alex is looking to at least\nmake a start on removing it by avoiding being what he calls \u201cthat faceless\nUnion\u201d.\n\u201cEmails from the Union need to be\nmore personal, you are more likely to\ncome to an event organised by people\nyou know or have bothered to come\ntalk to you, or at very least people\nyou\u2019re familiar with.\u201d\nAlex is also looking to take a different angle on his approach with Freshers than with previous years. He wants\nthem to see the Union not so much as\nthe sugar-daddy of entertainment and\nbooze, but as lots of older and wiser\nsiblings to join in the fun with.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that they know all\nthe things they\u2019re enjoying are run\nby students. It\u2019s so easy to come from\nschool to this huge university and to\nthink club or bar nights are being run\nby \u2018adults\u2019 or professionals. But, if we\nget them to realise everything around\nthem is organised by people that have\nonly been here a year sometimes, it\u2019ll\nencourage them to get involved. If they\nreally want to be involved, it\u2019s not that\nhard and there is a way into it.\u201d\nThe analogies of families within the\nUnion may sound absurd, but the concept is something that the Medics and\ntheir Freshers at Imperial thrive on.\nThis hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by Alex ei-ther. He\u2019s keen to take elements of the\nMedics\u2019 Union and implement them\ninto the central Union in Beit Quad.\nUsing the Medics\u2019 way of communication of representation throughout\ntheir students is the first way he will\nbring faces to the \u2018faceless Union\u2019.\n\u201cI want to know who my year rep is,\nI want to know what their names are,\nwhat they look like and their email ad-dress. At the moment you have to navigate your way through the RCSU website to try and find out who they are in\nBiology. You need to put this somewhere obvious, like up on a board. It\u2019s\nunashamedly copying from the med-ics, but it works.\u201d\nOn the flip-side and away from academic representation, he wants to\nbring the fun-loving reputation Medics\nhave to the South Kensington campus.\n\u201cWhen the Medic\u2019s do their themed\nbops on Friday nights, they\u2019re unique\nand they\u2019re absolutely packed [at Reynold\u2019s Bar]. We need clubs and societies to put in applications to take over\nthe new venue [Metric] and put on\nthemed nights. That\u2019s good at attracting people, and it\u2019s not run by faceless\nUnion people again,\u201d he says. \u201cI think\nthe Union is lagging behind, when\ncompared to the Reynold\u2019s, because\nthe events it puts on are organised for\nstudents rather than by students.\u201d\nAs the conversation approaches the\nsubject that is hot on the lips of the\ncasual punter at the Union\u2019s bars, Alex\ngives a wry smile. He knows what\u2019s\ncoming with the mention of the new\nnightclub and bars, and he\u2019s obviously\nkeen to talk about it. After all, the Union\u2019s bars are what he freely admits is\nall that most students see as the Union.\n\u201cMost students by the end of their\nfirst year will either see it as that or\nget involved with the Union\u2019s other as-pects. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d How is he going\nto solve it, then? \u201cIt\u2019s letting students\nget involved with the new club and\ncopying the medic \u2018bop\u2019 system they\nhave at Reynolds.\u201d\nThe renovation of dB\u2019s nightclub\nwhich will see it renamed Metric will\nalso allow an avenue of entertainment\nwhich hasn\u2019t been seen at the Union\nbefore: good live music.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the factors of the design\nand we\u2019re hoping to have a really good\ntouring venue for bands.\u201d It\u2019s the use\nof students that Metric will make a\nsuccess of the space that dB\u2019s couldn\u2019t.\n\u201cWe need more bands from outside\nas well as more bands from Imperial\nplaying there.\u201d\nThe new nightclub, which sees\na substantial part of \u00a32.4 million\npumped into it, also opens up the possibility for the Union to benefit from\nexternal visitors.\n\u201cWe are rebuilding it for us and it\nneeds to be primarily for Imperial stu-dents. If it isn\u2019t, then it\u2019s failing.\u201d\nWhen I bandy the idea around of\nMetric being seen alongside King\u2019s\nCollege or LSE\u2019s open student club\nnights with a slight sense of ridicule,\nAlex is keen to shoot the ridicule\ndown.\n\u201cWhen Metric is finished and it looks\nand does what we hope, it\u2019s certainly\ngoing to be competitive as a venue to\nthose places. I have no problem with\nadvertising it to other universities in\nLondon and having multi-university\nevents at Metric.\u201d\nThe nightlife at Imperial isn\u2019t the\nonly thing students have been complaining about in recent times. A\nquick look at Facebook shows nearly\n1000 students have joined the \u201cFuck\nOur Imperial Lives (FOIL)\u201d group. It\nis a group where people collectively\ndespair at their perceived hardships at\nImperial. Wisely or not, Alex doesn\u2019t\nread too much into it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tongue in cheek. In a way, it\u2019s all\nself-induced pain because everyone\nsecretely enjoys the fact they\u2019re at such\na good university and it\u2019s nice to complain \u2018Oh, haven\u2019t I got so much work?\u2019\nand to tell your friends about it. It\u2019s not\nas funny as \u2018Overheard at Imperial.\u201d\nSo do Imperial students whine too\nmuch?\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. There are plenty of good reasons to whine, because\nthings do go properly wrong. There is\npoorly marked coursework and feed-back; there are badly taught lectures;\nlecturers that don\u2019t turn up. Those\nkinds of issues aren\u2019t given as much attention as those problems on the FOIL\ngroup.\u201d\nDespite barely containing his excitement about the new venues, they\nare not Alex\u2019s priority. His priority\nis something which many see as the\nmore mundane side of the Union: the\nrepresentation network.\n\u201cWe want to increase the representation network to help them whine!\nWe want whining aimed at the Union\nrather than at Facebook.\u201d It\u2019s almost\nlike he\u2019s putting himself up for sacri-fice. \u201cThe representation network depends on people knowing about it and\nI don\u2019t think people feel confident or\nable to go up the chain of representation when there is a problem. Enabling\nthat to happen doesn\u2019t sound like a\ngrand vision but it was something that\ngot me thinking about running for the\nposition in the first place.\u201d\nSo is Alex a commanding officer or\na front-line soldier? Surprisingly, for\nsomeone so perfectly legible to be the\nnew face of Imperial College Union, it\nlooks like he\u2019s happy to drive the Union tank from the back seats, albeit\nwith his head poking out the top.\nAlex on a trip with the Fellwanderers society; with the Sabbatical team he will be in charge of, excluding Meera Ganeshadevan who has already resigned; and finding Muesli in Beit\u2019s club store rooms.\nFEATURE\n\n"

So what exactly have we\non offer? Caz Knight has been busy in\nLondon\u2019s theatres: an excellent production of the beloved, swinging Hair\nis currently showing at the Guilgud\nTheatre and elsewhere, at the Peacock,\nthe subject of neuroscience is under the\nlimelight. The excellent Les doigts de la\nmain \u2013 a French dance troupe perform\na physical, poetic interpretation of varying mental illnesses. Clearly it is a spec-tacle, with sensitive undertones.\nAs for me, I have engaged with one\ndifficult subject: the display of a work\nof art by recognised criminal Charles\nBronson (about whom a feature-length\nfilm was out in cinemas only recent-ly) in the public space of the London\nUnderground.\nElsewhere, I had the pleasure of\nvisiting Pick Me Up \u2013 a novel contemporary art fair, held this year at\nSomerset House. Graphic art is quite\ndifferent from traditional works of art,\nand delighted me in quite a different\nway. Hopefully we will be seeing more\nof this in the future. As for the upcoming weeks, there are a few good shows\nin the private galleries of Mayfair and\nof course, the larger galleries also.\nPurely\npsychedelic\nRosieMilton\nRosieMilton Arts Editor\nPsychotic? Just plain Psy with \u2018Les doigts de la main\u2019\nCaz KnightgoestothePeacockTheatretowatchthedelicatelychoreographedinterpretationofmentalillnessonthestage\nO\nne in four people will\nbe diagnosed with a\nmental illness in their\nlife. The human brain\neach day consumes the\nequivalent energy of two bananas and\ncontains around 100 billion neurons,\neach making up to 10,000 synapses.\nIt is not often that a show starts with\nthe audience being given a very short\nintroduction to neuroscience as the\nspotlight is shined on them, but thus\nstarts Psy at Sadler\u2019s Wells\u2019 Peacock\nTheatre \u2013 the latest energetic offering\nfrom French-Canadian dance troupe\n\u2018Les 7 doigts de la main\u2019 (the 7 Fingers).\nIt has not been often, either, that the\nsubject of mental illness has been ex-plored, portrayed by and given rise to\nsuch an explosion of dance, trapeze\nswinging, gymnastics, knife throw-ing, somersaulting and more. The\neleven member troupe, many of whom\ntrained at the National Circus School\nin Montreal, each assume the identity\nof one mental illness and adjust their\nperformance styles accordingly so that\nevery motion, jump and expression illustrates and brings alive perfectly the\nnature of their character\u2019s condition.\nThe eclectic mix of agoraphobia, ma-nia, addiction, OCD, insomnia and\namnesia to name a few is oddly reminiscent of Ken Kesey\u2019s One Flew Over\nthe Cuckoos Nest (a dance version of\nwhich is actually coming to the Peacock Theatre in June), without being\nconstrained by the rigid rules of a psychiatric ward. Psy balances the mix of\nindividual and group routines as well\nas interludes of comical dialogue, with\neach member of the troupe given the\nchance to convey their mentally ill persona via their specific talents, as well as\ncoming together to execute some finely\nhoned routines together. An especially\nimpressive feat of choreography was\nthe juggling \u2018en masse\u2019 involving all\neleven dancers. There was also Johnny\nthe constantly horny Addict whirling about in his German wheel; Suzi,\nwith Intermittent Explosive Disorder\nastounding all with her knife manipulation skills to the sound of slow and\ndeliberate dubstep and a very sad and\nmoving scene where John? Joe? Jim?\nthe Amnesiac (tries to) remember his\njuggling skills against an urban back-drop, swapping his props for juggling\npins and pins for props.\nThe team chemistry and synchronicity is impressive and evident as they\nmove seamlessly with and around each\nother \u2013 moving as if part of one interconnected organism, their routines\nflowing and changing like an Escher\ndrawing. The playlist that accompanies the wild routine moves between\nthe sad and classical and the very modern and includes music from the film\nAmelie by Yann Tiersen, hip hop and\nthe very apt song Frontier Psychiatrist\n(\u201c\u2026that boy needs therapy\u2026\u201d) by the\nAvalanches which plays as Dexter with\nMultiple Personality Disorder vaults\nand catapults off his teeterboard.\nHowever, it seems unfair to single out\nany of the routines for they were all jaw\ndropping and all the dancers equally\ntalented, performing their pieces with\nprecision and to perfection: never has\nthe audience ever broken into applause\nso frequently in any show before, ending by giving the 7 Fingers an extremely well deserved standing ovation.\nPsy continues at the Peacock Theatre, Portugal Street, until May 15th.\nTickets start at 10 pounds.\nT\nhe recent installation of\nan artwork by criminal\nCharles Bronson on the\nLondon Underground by\napparent guerilla group\nArt Below invites the reconsideration\nof morals in several areas.\nIt has become a question of correct-ness: political and social. How can we\njustify admiring the work of a violent\ncriminal in our public places? After the\ncurrent political climate and the excitement of the general election, we are seeing every law and promise of moral justice strapped down and tightened until\nthe country is practically turning blue.\nThis attitude smacks of currying favour.\nAs a cultural aesthetician I support the\nchance to see the inner-workings \u2013\nsome call it soul, Vasari called it \u2018genius\u2019\n\u2013 of a criminalised thug, by the visual\ntransliteration of his artworks. My curiosity in this respect, is what has allowed\nme to consider his work. However, in\ntraditional terms of competence, Bronson is somewhat lacking. His drawings\nwould benefit from a more rounded\nform to appear less flat. The reality is\ncloser to the dozy, fantastical doodlings\nof a day-dreaming schoolboy than the\nnext workings of a Hans Bellmer.\nThe subject matter has raised the\nmost protests: a head with three grimacing faces, two with bared teeth and\ntongues hanging out, the schizophrenic\nbody buckled down into a straight-jacket, clearly labelled \u2018restraint\u2019\n. The\ncartoon-like style is distantly similar to\nthe animation of The Yellow Submarine\n(1968). The message implies a disturbed\nmind: whether of the artist himself, or\nmerely of the character he has depicted,\nthe implication is there.\nThe problem with Art Below\u2019s intentions is that they are very obviously\ncapitalizing on Bronson\u2019s celebrity sta-tus. It is unlikely that any inmate of this\ncountry\u2019s penitentiary establishment\nhas managed to reach the public to his\nextent with their work, before or even\nagain, under any other circumstances.\nPerhaps we will be seeing a series of inmate\u2019s works, with Bronson\u2019s the first to\ncatch our attention, or possibly a slew\nof bizarre celebrities\u2019 attempts at art.\nWhatever the case, Art Below have certainly embraced the modern more of\nstar exploitation with this affair. -RM\nCharles Bronson: criminal and artist apparently\n\u2018Triptophrenia\u2019 at Angel tube station\nOne of the acrobatic displays as performed by the Seven Fingers dance troupe for their riveting performance of Psy\n\n"

He likes\nto read trashy horror novels and thinks\nFamily Guy is very mehh. He wishes he\nhad more time to see the kids.\nThe Election is like the Ashes \u2013 suddenly everybody knows everything\nabout cricket and won\u2019t stop talking\nabout it.

You know what, fuck it I\u2019m\nmoving to North Korea.\nOn a lighter note, at least I no longer have to listen to celebrities singing\nfor Haiti. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that\nno-one talks about Haiti anymore. It\u2019s\nlike it\u2019s suddenly become a really unfashionable charity. I heard that Haiti\nare releasing their own charity single\nfor the poor souls that were exposed to\nthe vile slaughter of REM\u2019s \u2018Everybody\nHurts\u2019.\nThey would have made a lot more\nmoney if they just gave us the ultimatum of money or charity single.

Here\u2019s\nthe game: Do whatever you can to find out the name of the person sitting next to you. (You can\u2019t sit next to your friends) Now open their\nfacebook page and just stare at it, or perhaps laugh at their status. Tilt\nthe screen slightly to esnure you ensure that your stalkee has clear view.\nYou get 1 point if they move away and double points if they file a restraining order.\nDAWN OF THE ASIANS\nThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re trapped in a mall full of brain-dead zombies, only this time, the mall is the Library\nand the zombies are Asians. If you touch or make eye\ncontact with an Asian, you become infected and lose.\nYou\u2019ll need a medikit, food supply and a shotgun.\nDon\u2019t forget to use your melee attack. I\u2019ve lost too\nmany friends to Asians because they forgot their melee attack. You can respawn at the cafe coke machine.\nSAVING PRIVATE RYMAN\nThis is a great game for you and your\nfriends. The idea is to re-enact the\nOhama Beach landing with your sta-tionary. Choose your teams (Gener-ally your worst friends are nominated\nas the Germans) and then find your\nTom Hanks HB pencil. Using pencil\ncases as the landing boats and computers as German casemates (those turret\nthings) try to get your Tom Hanks HB\nto your French Nemesis, who will be\nlaunching every item of stationary they\nhave at you. For extra realism, bring\ntomato ketchup for blood and perhaps\ntorch one of the computers if you have\ntime. You\u2019ll need to use a mirror on a\nstick like Tom Hank does. Just do everything Tom Hank does. Don\u2019t let your\nTom Hanks HB die.\nULTIMATE REVISION\nWait a second! This doesn\u2019t sound like a game that comes under procrastination! That is unless you\u2019re revising for a subject\nthat you\u2019re not even taking! This game is so insanely badass\nit practically seems stupid. Ultimate Revision has been cited\nas the next base jumping and the new rush for thrill-seekers.\nGet your mobile phone camera out, run up to someone and\nthen slap yourself in the face.\nSend videos to hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHAPPY \u2018WTF?\u2019 SLAPPING!\nEvery point you earn will be sent to Haiti. Not\ntranslated to cash form or anything...just points\n\n"

With IC\nlosing the toss once again, University of Sussex elected to bat first.\nThe Sussex openers made a steady\nstart by accumulating 61 runs in 12\novers before Ankit Patel got one to\nseam back in to get the Sussex captain\nLBW. Navin Surtani made a breakthrough with a slower ball which was\ncaught at mid off, sending the second\nopener back to the pavilion. Soon after\nIC brought on the first of three spinners they employed during their time\nin the field. Hasit Mehta bowled with\nsupreme accuracy; hitting the right\nareas to make it incredibly difficult\nto score. Coupled with tight fielding,\npressure began to build on the Sussex\nmiddle order, which turned out to be\ntheir downfall. Hasit picked up 4 wickets for just 20runs in his 10 overs.\nTight bowling at the other end from\nRehan Ali and Pawan Patel didn\u2019t let\nSussex get away. Rahul Pai continued\nwere Hasit left off, keeping the Pavilion\nend tight, while at the M4 end Anirudh\nSompalli kept getting the odd wicket\nas the end of the innings approached.\nUniversity of Sussex ended on 199-9\nfrom their 50 overs.\nIn reply IC\u2019s new and incredibly attacking opener, Sompalli, dispatched\nthe second ball for four over extra cov-er. In fact, he smacked it so hard that\ndespite 15 players looking for the it in\nthe sidelines, the brand new Readers\nball was not found.

Not concen-trating, he skied the next ball high over\nmid-off, who completed an impressive\ncatch over his shoulder. Matt attacked\nin similar style to reach a quickfire 45,\ntaking 20 runs off one over which included a huge six over midwicket. The\nrest of the chase was fairly uneventful\nwith the IC batsman all contributing\nbut then getting out. Yasir Bin Riaz\n(26), Ankit Patel (24) and Mehta (34)\nall chipped in, until keeper and premier finisher Adam Hugill (50 not out)\ncalmly finished the chase in 37.5 overs.\n****\nAfter the 1 and a half hour minibus ride\nto Brighton and arriving in time for\na novel pre-match warm up, Captain\nPete Swallow won the toss and decided\nto bowl. President Andy Payne was\ngiven the first over and had obviously\nbeen watching the 2006/7 Ashes as\npreparation, immitating Steve Harmison and opening with a wide ball, before rectifying his shocking start with\nsix dot balls in a row. Shouldering re-sponsibility, Swallow (2-15) took the\nsecond over and things started to improve as he soon bowled both openers\nwith firstly a cunning slower ball and\nthen a faster yorker. Things got even\nbetter as Payne got in on the act with a\nvicious lifter to hit the gloves and have\nthe batsman caught behind. To keep\nthe pressure high, Ian Woolf and Rajiv\nBhar were brought on and the wickets\ncontinued to fall with Bhar eventually\ntaking 4-29.\nWoolfy somehow managed to not\ntake a single wicket despite having the\nslip cordon salivating for his entire 10\nover spell. Sussex managed to steady\nthe ship near the end and progressed\nto a large total. Fortunately, Payne (3-39) and fresher Jonny Cooper managed to take the remaining 3 wickets to\nleave Imperial needing 169 to win.\nWith a second pair of openers in as\nmany matches, Imperial got off to a\nslow start that turned sour with the\nloss of the opening pair for single fig-ures. In came Payne and Rohan Babla,\nwho managed to get the innings going\nwith a 50 partnership.\nThe stand was dominated by Payne,\nwith an innings of 41 which was typically brutal to both sides, as when he\nwasn\u2019t smashing the ball to all parts of\nthe leg side boundary he was watching\nthe ball whistle past his off stump. A\nmassive DFL maximum over long-on\nwas the highlight, closely followed by\nan impressive argument with the Sussex team about fielding restrictions.\nUnfortunately, the journey to the seaside had wiped all notion of the purpose of a cricket bat from the other\nImperial players and their serene progress was spectacularly halted when\nBabla (with the second-highest score\nof 10) and Payne both got out in the\nspace of two balls. Babla took a rash\nswipe and skied the ball before Payne,\nstill angry at how Babla had given his\nwicket away, lofted an easy catch to\nmid-off; this triggered the mother of\nall collapses where Imperial fell from\n75-2 to 81 all out.\nA dejected Imperial team made their\nway back to London, where Andy\nshowed his prowess at driving the minibus by stalling twice in two minutes,\nwhich cheered up everyone no-end.\nThe team performance was excellent\ngiven the available players and there\nwas an impressive improvement in\nfielding from the match on the previous Sunday. If improvements are made\nin the batting order and with more\nplayers hitting the ball, IC 2nd XI will\nbe a force to be reckoned with.\n\n"

    "content": "14 felix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nF\norty-three years on and\nHair is still \u201cblowing the\nroof off\u201d our theatres \u2212 according to both London\nproducer Cameron Mackintosh and this reviewer. The American\ntribal love-rock musical was written\nby young people for young people and\nmarked the beginning of a time where\nsaid young people began to actually\nwant to go to the theatre. Daring, ab-surd, surreal, lewd and crude all at\nonce, Hair is also both fun and deeply\npolitical, tracking the lives of a tribe of\nNew York hippies as they rebel against\nthe government, \u2018square\u2019 parents and\nthe draft. Free love, free acid and free\nflowing hair abound but the looming\nthreat and arrival of the draft throw\nhippy Claude into moral indecision as\nhe deliberates over whether to resist\nthe draft or resist pacifism.\nWith book and lyrics by Gerome\nRagni and James Rado (spotted in the\naudience looking very well preserved\nfor his seventy eight years) and music by Galt Macdermot, this colourful\nand groovy show began life in 1967\noff-Broadway and has since enjoyed\nlengthy runs on both sides of the Atlantic as well as countless recordings\nof the soundtrack, a film adaptation\nand several awards including a Tony\nAward and a Drama Desk Award won\nby the 2009 Broadway cast. The same\ncast and director Diana Paulus have\nnow been whisked over to London for\nthe next six months to continue in the\nWest End for the current production at\nthe Gielgud theatre.\nThe excitement before the show was\nutterly palpable and continued that\nway throughout every second of the\nfollowing two and a half hours, largely\ndue to the electric cast who brought\nthe forty songs, multiple dance routines and plentiful comedy to life. The\ncast members are evidently completely\nin love with each other, confirmed by\n\u2018tribe member\u2019 Crystal Jones speaking\nafter the show \u2013 and is it any wonder,\nfollowing month after month of performing love-and-drug-fuelled Be-Ins\nand salacious choreography. The fun\nthey have together is highly infectious.\nWonderful cast aside, this production of Hair is also magnificent from\na purely technical point of view. Stage,\ncostume, lighting and sound design-ers, not to mention the stellar on-stage\nband, have come together beautifully\nto create an on-stage psychedelic haven which creates a powerful atmosphere throughout, especially during\nClaude\u2019s last acid trip before being sent\noff to Nam (where a Black, female Abe\nLincoln makes an appearance).\nIn true hippy style, the audience are\nhugged, touched, given flowers and invited to a Be-In. Those in the front row\nalso get the special treat of a close up\nview of loose cannon Berger\u2019s (played\nby Will Swenson) loincloth-clad pack-age. The show culminates in the interactive Be-In where the audience are\ntugged from their seats and invited to\nrave away to Let the Sunshine In as the\ncast dole out more hugs.\nNot only did Hair get more young\npeople going to the theatre but it also\npaved the way for rock music to be introduced into theatre. Now we have Jesus Christ Superstar, the Rocky Horror\nShow and We Will Rock You, to name\na few.\nDirector and critic Charles Marowitz\nwrote of London\u2019s 1968 production of\nthe musical, \u201cit is almost entirely nourished by the current generation's hatred of what its 'senior citizens' have allowed America to become\u201d. Words that\necho uncannily what many of today\u2019s\nyouth feel towards the hippy/baby\nboomer generation regarding global\nwarming.

    "content": "4 felix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFEATURE\nY\nou can see why people have\nvoted Alex in as next year\u2019s\nImperial College Union\nPresident. Although it\u2019s\nhard for me to put forward\nfirst impressions of him as I\u2019ve known\nhim for about six months now (as part\nof the felix team), it\u2019s the exact reason\nwhy he\u2019s President next year. A combination of mild manners, good looks\nand an active involvement with most\nthings at Imperial means he\u2019s a familiar\nface; a face that other students obviously couldn\u2019t resist voting for.\nHe\u2019s on the other side of the bank\nholiday weekend that has seen him\nfinish his finals in Biology. He has one\nlast stretch of work in the form of a\nsix-week project before he completes\nhis degree and becomes the Union\nPresident.\nThough by no means has he had aspirations of authority since he arrived\nat Imperial four years ago.\n\u201cIn your first two years you\u2019re vaguely aware that there\u2019s this thing called\nthe Union and they put on bar nights,\u201d\nhe says. After he returned from a year\nin industry working with the Liberal\nDemocrats, he became Fellwanderers\nsociety Chair and subsequently more\naware of what a student union does.\n\u201cComing to the end of my final year,\nI discovered a lot I wasn\u2019t aware of\nbefore and from that I got an idea of\nthe potential of things that could hap-pen, and also about the rather strange\nstructure of the Union which can be\nmade clearer, not redone. I didn\u2019t even\nknow what the RWB board was until\nthis year,\u201d he says.\nThough some might worryingly flag\nup a lack of experience in the higher\nstructures of the Union considering\nhis time at Imperial, it may come as\na blessing in disguise. Alex Kendall is\nthe average Joe of Imperial College; the\naverage Joe you\u2019d probably want representing you, as Imperial students, to\nother institutions across the country.\nHe\u2019s not the type of student that has,\nas he puts it, \u201clived in the Union and\nknows everything about the Union\u201d.\nChoosing to work with such a large\npolitical body like the Liberal Democrats as part of his degree may lead\npeople to view his time as Union President as another stepping stone in his\npolitical ladder. He\u2019s keen to dispel this\nhowever.\n\u201cI\u2019m genuinely not a career politican\nand I\u2019m not doing this for my CV. I\ndon\u2019t agree. No sabbatical I\u2019ve met has\ndone it purely for their CV,\u201d he pro-tests. When I point out the recent resignation of what would have been next\nyear\u2019s Deputy President of Education,\nMeera Ganeshadevan (who instead\ntook up a three month internship at\nCredit Suisse), Alex is quick to see both\nsides of the situation.\n\u201cIn Meera\u2019s case, I think she wasn\u2019t\nwholly committed to being Deputy\nPresident of Education, but I don\u2019t\nthink you could say she doesn\u2019t care\nabout students. After all, she decided\nto run in the first place and there are\neasier things than putting your face in\nfront of 14,000 students. I appreciate\npeople who are true to their promises,\nand standing for election is a promise,\nbut I also don\u2019t judge people too harshly.\u201d he says.\nFor himself however, he hints there\nmay have been political aspirations\nonce, but says that his time in politics\ntuned them flat.\n\u201cStrangely enough, the experience\n[with the Lib Dems] also put me off\npolitics, I am now less interested in going into politics than I was.\u201d Beyond his\ninterest in student politics then, what\ndoes he actually want to do? After deferring a Masters programme at Imperial to take up his Presidency, he\u2019s still\nleaving his future unroofed. His uncertainty is probably oddly familiar to\nmany students at Imperial as he gives\nhis response to my question about his\nfuture career.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I want to do with\nmy life. It\u2019s either science or business,\nHe\u2019s not the type of student\nthat has, as he puts it, \u201clived\nin the Union and knows\neverything about the Union\u201d.\nA NEW FACE\nFOR IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nUNION\nNEXT YEAR\u2019S UNION PRESIDENT, ALEX KENDALL TALKS\nTO FELIX ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR THE NEW NIGHTCLUB,\nFOLLOWING THE MEDICS\u2019 LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO\nHAVING FUN AND WHY IMPERIAL STUDENTS SHOULD\nBE WHINING...

    "content": "31\nfelix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nSPORT\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOn a cold February morning, the Imperial College Sailing Club ventured into\nthe depths of Oxford for the southern\nqualifiers to the British University Sailing Association (BUSA) team racing\nchampionships. The weather offered a\nlight fog and little wind- giving a bleak\nview of the Oxford countryside and a\nbleak view of the weekend ahead. It\u2019s\na shame this rather romantic image of\nthe countryside was shattered by one\nof the Imperial team, who managed to\nsoak his kit in milk on the train journey\nand the stench was beginning to engulf\nthe whole of Oxford.\nImperial\u2019s first races did not go to\nplan, with no wind and poor starts giving easy victories to Portsmouth 2 and\nSouthampton 2. The smell, the two\ndefeats and the lack of wind put the\nImperial team in a foul mood ahead\nof their race against previous BUSA\nchampions University of London 1st\n(ULU 1).\nDuring this race the wind picked\nup and while Imperial did not win the\nrace, they put up a good fight and attacked at every opportunity. Fiona\nWall and Claire Trant got in a particularly vicious fight, engaging the ULU\n1 team captain in a gripping start line\nbattle. With a steady breeze now blowing away the fog to reveal the gentle\nOxford countryside, Imperial were\nnow warmed up and ready for their\nrace against their regular training partners ULU 3.\nBoth teams got off to an equal start\nand Imperial sailors Chris O\u2019Donnell\nand Martin Hauge were first to the\nwindward mark, followed loosely by\ntwo ULU 3 sailors. Despite having a\nboat in first place, Imperial were losing\nthe race...but only just. Chris and Martin stopped at the second mark, waiting to pounce on the two ULU 3 sailors\nbehind them, attacking them and letting Imperial team mates through. Despite ULU 3\u2019s best efforts, the trap was\nexecuted smoothly, allowing Imperial\nto win the race.\nFiona and Claire started the next\nrace against Brunel with some unusual\ntactics- chatting up the opposition and\nserenading ducks.\nThis insane behaviour must have distracted Brunel because it gave Imperial\nthe lead right from the start. Imperial\nwanted to keep this lead secure by taking out the Brunel boats and leaving\nthem no chance to fight back. Instead,\nChris and Martin (who were again in\nfirst) sailed off, leaving Gavin MacAulay and Henley Leong alone to fight 2\nBrunel boats by themselves.\nThis cowardly streak from Chris\nand Martin vanished by the last mark\nwhere they acquired right of way and\ntried to T-bone a Brunel boat, forcing\nthem to get out the way. This gave Imperial a solid victory.\nFinally Imperial beat Oxford 3s, securing their place for the next day\u2019s\nsailing, while 5 teams were knocked\nout. This left Imperial with a night full\nof pubs, jump starting cars and generally getting lost (yes, that is possible,\neven in Oxford!) before the next day of\nsailing.\nFate, however, had other plans for\nImperial. In order to get full rank-ings, the organisers decided that there\nwould not be enough wind to complete\nenough races, so two teams had to be\neliminated. This meant Imperial, who\nonly won the races necessary in order\nto qualify for the second day, along\nwith Reading, were eliminated without\nthe chance to fight for a better place.\nImperial finished the weekend by\ncoming joint 11th out of 17 teams.\nChris O\u2019Donnell Sailing\nSailing brave the cold February waves to compete at BUSA championship\nThey don\u2019t look very happy, but neither would you if you were stuck on a freezing cold lake with the stale stench of milk\nDavid Wilson\nOther stories from the sporting week\nwhilst nothing\u2019s happening at Imperial Sports Editor\nT\nhere has been very little\nin the way of sporting activity at Imperial College\nduring the first few weeks\nof the summer term presumably due to the exam slog associated with the summer term. As a result\nfelixSport have resorted to including\nadverts for osteopathy treatment and\ntrawling for snippets of global sports\nnews to fill up our pages. So, if there\nare any of you taking part in summer\nsports activities with the college, send\nin your reports so that you can immortalized in the pages of felix.\nJoe Cole, Frank Lampard and John\nTerry were among a host of top names\nwho turned out at Upton Park for the\nacademy director, Tony Carr\u2019s, testi-monial. Although the Chelsea players\nwere unable to play in the match due\nto the Premier League run in, all three\nsheepishly donned West Ham United\nkits which was a sight in itself. The\nWest Ham fans managed to refrain\nfrom the \u2018Fat\u2019 Frank jibes and were\nalmost clambering over each other to\nget autographs off the Chelsea players.\nFickle game, football.\nMeanwhile, over in America, Rory\nMcIlroy won his first PGA tour title\nat the Quail Hollow Open over the\nweekend. The Irishman scored a final round of 62, that would be an impressive 10-under-par and he finished\nfour shots ahead of Phil Mickelson\nwho is soon expected to overtake Tiger Woods in the rankings as World\nnumber one. Even more impressive is\nthat McIlroy, at twenty years of age,\nbecame the youngest winner of a PGA\ntour event since 1996 when a a certain\nTiger Woods burst onto the scene.\nWoods, the global sports phenomenon\nturned professional at 21. McIlroy? Oh\nhe\u2019s been around since he was 18.\nMark Cavendish was withdrawn\nfrom the Tour de Romandie by his\nteam after winning the second stage\nfor sticking his fingers up at his critics.\nLiterally. Cavendish apologized for his\nactions which he claims were aimed at\nhis critics, some of whom had claimed\nhe had gone off the boil. As well as\nbeing withdrawn from the competi-tion, Cavendish was also fined \u00a33,640.\nHopefully the Manxman will return\nto dominate the sprint sections of this\nyears prestigious Tour de France, sans\ntwo fingered salute.\nReports this week are claiming that\nJoe Calzaghe could be tempted out of\nretirement for a \u2018superfight\u2019 rematch\nwith Bernard Hopkins. No, Floyd\nMayweather against Manny Pacquiao\nwould be true superfight, any matchup\nbetween Calzaghe and Hopkins would\nsurely be an exhibition fight from a\nprevious era. Anyone who witnessed\nthe first fight between these two surely\nwould not want to endure another.\nThere is no doubting that they were\nboth great fighters; Hopkins dominated the middleweight division for years\nbut now aged 45 he\u2019s far and away over\nthe hill. Calzaghe became joined an\nelite club bowing out with world titles and an unblemished record intact.\nCalzaghe seems to have succumbed to\nthe greatest vice of all retired boxers;\nboredom. Many of the greats couldn\u2019t\nresist one final crack all glory, Marciano, Foreman, Balboa and Holyfield\nat present. But as Calzaghe\u2019s father and\ntrainer Enzo nicely put it \u201cIf Joe comes\nback now, he\u2019s playing with danger because he has nothing to gain and everything to lose\u201d.\nEngland cricket coach Andy Flower\nlabeled his team as \u2018dangerous\u2019 before\ntheir Twenty20 super eights showdown with Pakistan yesterday. It has\nbeen recently shown that the greatest\ndanger associated with English cricket\nis the expecations and hope which the\nfans place upon the team.\nManchester United\u2019s striker Michael\nOwen has not had a season to remem-ber; his appearances on the pitch were\nlimited and he then suffered a hamstring injury in the Carling Cup final\nwhich demolished any small change\nof him going to South Africa. Owen\u2019s\npoor luck continued as Nemo Spirit,\nthe horse he part owns disappointed\nat the Chester Cup . Teammates Nani\nand John O\u2019Shea fared better as both\nracked up betting wins.\nThe most pleasing news for Global\nmale population is that Anna Kournikova is returning to Wimbledon to play\nin a veterans tournament this summer,\nat the grand old age of 28.

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA colourful new fair rolls into London\nRosie Milton goes to Somerset House to see the work of up-and-coming contemporary graphic artists\nS\no the first fair of the year for\nme, Pick Me Up: Contemporary Graphic Art Fair \u2013 held\nlast week at Somerset House\n\u2013 is apparently the first of\nits kind in this country. Set out along\ntwo floors in a wing of the regal Somerset House, the event was welcoming\nand intimate (as opposed to the overwhelming Frieze).\nThe d\u00e9cor, by way of primary-col-oured arrows and shapes, immediately tells you that the contents will\noffer simple forms. This is the attraction of graphic art. The experience is\nsomething like being in a sweet shop:\nso much candy on display you want to\ncollect and consume. I found myself\nassessing the prices of several of the\nprints, eager to add something to my\n(small, but growing) collection of art.\nTo get an idea, digital prints by graphic\nartist James Joyce ranged from \u00a385\u00a395 for one of five editions.\nThe prints that caught my eye were\none large-scale graphic of a plastic\nfish soy sauce container (such as you\nfind often with take-away sushi), almost empty of its liquid and another\nof a large black droplet with the words\n\u2018we\u2019re doomed\u2019 illustrating light catching the curved edge.\nMuch is pleasing about the graphic\nstyle and illustration: crisp, bright\ncolours, simple signs and text are\ncombined, resulting in a composition\nusually found on consumer product packaging or those achingly cool,\nglossy urban magazines, whose purpose is rarely clear. Here then, the purpose of Pick Me Up is to bring recognition to graphic art in market terms.\nI would have to agree that I would be\nhappy having 85% of what was on display here, than much of the conceptual\nwork found at Frieze. At least prints,\ndrawings and 3D models are tangible,\nas opposed to an idea.\nTo expand on the media used in the\ndisplays, there were not only digital\nprints, but also screen printing, block\nprinting (actually live by the studio\nPeepshow, set up in one niche of the\nroom), textile prints, illustration,\nhand-drawn graphics and 3D models such as painted wooden toys. In a\nseparate room a film was playing and\nin another niche of the main room was\na stall displaying the treasures of an\nEast London printing shop, Nobrow.\nAs I pored over the rich illustrations,\nI caught a whiff of freshly printed ink\nand the boy sitting on the stall confirmed to me that these picture books\nwere hot off the press.\nAlthough there was a slight sense\nof art-school-amateurism about the\nshow \u2013 the opening gambit being \u201c20\nup-and-coming-artists\u201d, the work was\ngood and widely ranging in subject\nmatter, style and media.\nStill considering purchasing an artwork when I came to the end of the\nexhibition, a room lined with an exclusive prints for the show by each of the\nartists seemed a more appealing and\n\u2018cheaper\u2019 option for an art-show-tour-ist like myself. I purchased a cheery orange illustration of an Indian girl with\na child on her back for \u00a320, delighted\nthat I could take a piece of the show\nwith me. I will definitely be making a\nbee-line for this show next year, if it is\nto continue.\nAnthony Burrill, \u2018Pick Me Up: Contemporary Graphic Art Fair\u2019, 2009 Nobrow, Miscellaneous Nobrow Press publications, courtesy: Nobrow.

No? Well\nneither did I until I\nwatched Tajomaru, a\n2009 Japanese movie about an outlawed Royal who leaves his kingdom\nto become a badass with an oversized sword. Besides being a decent\nhack\u2019n\u2019slash 16th Century Japanese\nepic, there was one scene which completely destroyed the po-faced tone of\nthe movie: when the exiled swordsman meets a group of bandits pillaging a village, they stop and present\nthemselves and their wonderful lives\nof rape and murder in rap format,\ncomplete with breakdancing and all.\nIt\u2019s a hilarious moment which seems\nweird at first but is actually quite fitting in the context.\nThis got me thinking about how intertwined hip-hop and oriental culture\nhave become over the years. These\ntwo seemingly opposing worlds have\ncollided in numerous media formats\nleading me to the conclusion that there\nmust be some sort of link between the\ntwo.\nIndeed, since starting out in 1992,\nthe Wu-Tang Clan \u2013 arguably the\ngreatest hip-hop crew ever \u2013 have\nbased their entire mythology and lyrical content on Chinese culture, TaoVirus Syndicate ally the murky beats\nof dubstep, courtesy of DJ MRK1,\nwith the grime vocals of emcees\nGoldfinger, JSD and Nika D. But\nthis ain\u2019t Kode9 & Spaceape. The\ntracks here have lost the grittiness of\nboth aforementioned genres by being completely overproduced. They\ndiffer from the growing number of\ngeneric dubstep \u201ctunes\u201d by the vo-cals, but these range from menacing\n(Anything) to comedic (Crazy) to\nmelodramatic and plain laughable\n(Believe). The only genuine tune is\nTalk to Frank, an ode to the drugs\nindustry with a genius chorus. In the\nend, though, they\u2019re just flogging a\nstillborn horse with \u201cpop-step\u2019 written all over it.\n- Greg Power\nHip-hop and oriental philosophy...?\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough not to be revising (and you must be if you\u2019re reading this) how about heading down to\nBrighton for a weekend festival this\nmonth? Over 350 bands are playing at\nvarious clubs and venues around the\ntown and if it\u2019s sunny you might even\nenjoy the beaches too.\nThe Great Escape\nWhere do I even begin? If you\u2019re fond of\nsand dunes and salty air there\u2019s Groove\nArmada, punk-reggae legends The\nSlits, indie cool kids like The Big Pink\nand Wild Beasts. Here\u2019s a very shortened list: The Sunshine Underground,\nCrystal Fighters, Chase & Status, Tinie\nTempah, Broken Social Scene, Japandroids, I Blame Coco, These New Puritans, The Walkmen, Cornershop, Slow\nClub, Tuung, Ellie Goulding, Marina &\nthe Diamonds, Mount Kimbie, Django\nDjango, and so on...\nWhen & Where:\nWho:\nBrighton\n13th - 14th May\n\u00a355 (3 day ticket) or less for single days\nMore Info and Full Lineup\nhttp://www.escapegreat.com\nMotorpsycho are an institution in their\nnative Norway, described as \u201cone of\nmusic\u2019s best kept secrets\u201d. This statement does not seem far-fetched upon\nlistening to their fourteenth full-length\nalbum (and 50th-something release\ncounting EPs and live albums since the\nband\u2019s inception in 1989) Heavy Metal\nFruit.\nEqual parts prog-rock, psychedelic\njams and stoner-metal, Motorpsycho\nproduce songs fusing the raw heaviness and dynamic range of Kyuss with\nthe structural complexity of Tool,\nthrowing in some incredible jazz licks\nand rock n\u2019 roll riffs. Six tracks of glorious sing-a-long vocals and far-out lyrics make for an exhilarating and trippy\nhour-long space odyssey.\n- Greg Power\nMotorpsycho\nHeavy Metal Fruit\nVirus Syndicate\nThe Breakout Trilogy\nism and kung-fu movies adapted to\ntheir experiences of life on the streets\nof New York City. They incorporate\ncomic book imagery of kung fu fighting into the hardships of being gangsta,\nmixing Chinese words with their own\nslang (for example they refer to their\nnative Staten Island as \u201cShaolin\u201d). The\nClan\u2019s spiritual leader and producer\nRZA has written two philosophical\nbooks titled \u201cThe Wu-Tang Manual\u201d\nand \u201cThe Tao of Wu\u201d which describe\nin depth the beliefs and founding principles of the group.\nThis is where the link is: self-pro-claimed \u201cgangstas\u201d may rap about mur-der, prison, misogyny and arson but\nthey all stick to a certain code among\ntheir individual circles. Honour thine\nHomie, rob from the rich and give to\nthe poor, live by the sword and die by\nthe sword and so on. There is a certain\nmorality to their lyrics which can only\nbe related back to things like the Bushido, the Samurai code by which retainers were taught to obey and defend\ntheir feudal lord above all else. These\nwarriors were ready to sacrifice their\nlives in the name of a cause which may\nseem ridiculous in our day and age, but\nback then meant everything. It is all\nabout honour, much like rap battles are\nall about coming out victorious having\ncrushed your enemy on the lyrical bat-tlefield. In Kobayashi\u2019s 1962 classic Harakiri the hero defeats an entire band\nof samurai and proceeds to cut their\ntopknots off, the sign of their samurai\nstatus, knowing they will have to kill\nthemselves because of the disgrace of\nthis loss. In the same way one decisive verbal jab about how overweight\nan opponent\u2019s mother is results in his\nutter humiliation, loss of honour and\nsubsequent stutter of death.\nThese analogies are best exemplified in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s incredible Ghost\nDog: Way of The Samurai, the story of\na ghetto hit man who lives by the codes\nof the Hagakure, an 18th-century Japanese warrior text. The soundtrack is\nhip-hop in all its glory (scored by the\nRZA) and Forest Whitaker is spot-on\nas the gangster-turned-modern samurai who carries the film to its final\nmassacre. Another tribute to kung fu\nmovies and Japanese anime was Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill, again scored by the RZA\nand featuring some tasty beats over a\nblood-splattered bride killing everyone in her way. These Western movies\nboth associate tales of revenge carried\nout by honour-bound warriors with a\nhip-hop soundtrack.\nIt would seem that it is also a two-way street then, since hip-hop is now\nbecoming a typical soundtrack for\nsamurai warriors to bop their heads to\nas they slice and dice. Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s anime series Samurai Champloo which aired in Japan in\n2005 frequently inserted\nelements of hip hop culture\nin every episode; rap, break\ndancing, turntablism, hip\nhop slang, and graffiti are\naplenty. The crossover is\ncomplete.\nThe ultimate fusion of both\ncultures arrived in 2007\nwhen Takashi Okazaki\u2019s\nlove of hip-hop music\nand American media\nwere combined in his\navant-garde manga Afro\nSamurai, featuring an\nAfrican-American samurai\nwho travels the land killing hundreds of enemies in\na quest to avenge his father\u2019s\ndeath. This was later adapted\ninto an award-winning anime series scored by (you guessed it) the\nRZA and voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. It is now being developed as a\nHollywood movie, which just goes\nto show how the two seemingly\nopposite worlds have become\nalmost synonymous in some\npeople\u2019s minds. And with\ngood reason: they\u2019re both\nhella badass.\nGreg Power explores the unlikely fusion of gangsta rap and samurai warriors\nHush...! Don\u2019t tell everyone but\nthere\u2019s a show combining all sorts of\nfun happenings a mere stone\u2019s throw\nfrom Imperial at the Royal Albert\nHall. Hush combines indie-folk and\nclassical music, beatboxing, stand-up comedy and flamenco dancing.\nWhat\u2019s not to like? It\u2019s a night of\nfolky bliss and enchantment.

Everyone\nis outgoing and the atmosphere is\ngreat, plus it\u2019s a flexible programme\nthat works really well with everyone\u2019s\nschedule.\u201d\nSolomon Zacharia, studying Civil\nEngineering, said \u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic\nexperience meeting other people and\ntalking to new students. When I\u2019m\ntaking tours, students are engaging\nand enjoy every bit of the tour. I\u2019ve also\nhelped out at careers fairs and met lots\nof people from other universities. I\u2019ve\nmade good friends here: we all come\nfrom different backgrounds and it\u2019s\ngood to talk to other people and see\nhow they do things.\u201d\nYou can apply for the\nRector\u2019s Ambassador Scheme at:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/international/\nstudents/rectorsambassadors\n3\nfelix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nNEWS\nC\nhemical engineers have\nbeen left fuming this week\nafter a printing blunder in\ntheir exam papers led to\nmass confusion and urgent rescheduling.\nOn Thursday 29th April, 3rd year\nstudents were due to take the \u2018Business\nfor Engineers\u2019 (BfE) multiple choice\nexam from 10am to 12pm. However,\ncandidates found themselves bewildered when their papers listed a choice\nof three exam numbers to note down\non answer sheets. Invigilators were\nthen almost immediately notified that\nthe majority of the papers were incomplete with alternate pages having been\nomitted. Amidst the chaotic scenes,\nstudents were told to leave the room\nand were then informed that the exam\nhad been cancelled, to be taken at a\nlater date.\nThose affected later received an apologetic email from Dr. Colin Love, Imperial College Business School\u2019s Director\nof Undergraduate Studies, who blamed\n\u201ca clerical error in the copying process\nof examination papers\u201d before stating\nthat the incident was \u201centirely the fault\nof the Business School\u201d. Alongside this,\nstudents were informed that the exam\nPrinting error halts business exam\n3rd year Chem. Engineers criticise Business School after exam is cancelled after 5 minutes, Matt Colvin reports\n\u201c...this event\nhighlights how\nlittle attention is\npaid to BfE by the\nBusiness School.\nOliver Calderbank\n3rd yr, Chem Eng\nInternational Office seek new Rector\u2019s Ambassadors for new programme\nThis week the International Office are\nseeking new volunteers to take part\nin this year\u2019s Rector\u2019s Ambassadors\nscheme. For those unfamiliar with the\nconcept, the Rector\u2019s Ambassadors\nbring the Departmental Ambassadors\ntogether, representing the College as a\nwhole at Open Days and campus-wide\ntours.\nStephanie Mambo, a 4th year Chem\nEng student and Rector\u2019s Ambassador,\nsaid; \u201cBeing a Rector\u2019s Ambassador is\nan honour. It\u2019s an opportunity to gain\nskills such as leadership, interpersonal\ncommunication skills and initiative,\nwhilst showcasing Imperial positively.\u201d\nStephanie has attended university\nfairs in Cyprus and Kenya as an Ambassador, and has also participated in\ncollege events such as the Post Graduate Open Day.\n\u201cThe fair in Cyprus was a once in\na life time opportunity. I was able to\nshare my experiences and talk in depth\nabout my course to highly driven\nEmily Govan\nEmily Govan\nhad been rescheduled for the 27th of\nMay, weeks later than anticipated.\nDr. Love, who described the situation\nat the time as a \u201ccock-up on a monumental scale\u201d spoke to felix regarding\nthe measures taken in the aftermath:\n\u201cThere was no option other than to\nstop the exam. As some had started\nwith the correct paper, it would be argued that to recommence, say, an hour\nlater would have given an unfair advan-tage. Also, at the time, it was not possible to confirm a restart time.\u201d\nThe new date and resulting delay has\nnot been well received due to its close\nproximity with the second set of the department\u2019s core module examinations,\nbeginning on the 3rd of June. Many\nwere also dissatisfied with the original\ntime of 6pm chosen for the rescheduled\nexam, although this was later changed\nto 2pm. Some have taken this opportunity to criticise the Business School\nitself for the handling of the BfE course\nover this academic year.\nIan Swords, a 3rd year student and\nalso Departmental Representative for\nChemEng, labels the debacle as, \u201ca simple error that could have been easily\nprevented which has now caused massive disruption to the year as a whole.\u201d\nHe also believes that this is, \u201cIn many\nways a fitting end to what has been a\npoor performance by the Business\nSchool all round. We all know they can\nproduce world class MBAs (Master of\nBusiness Administration) \u2013 why is the\nsame quality not reflected in their BfE\ncourses?\u201d\nFellow 3rd year student Oliver Calderbank agrees, stating that, \u201cthis event\nhighlights how little attention is paid to\nBfE by the Business School. The course\nseriously needs to be re-designed and\nmore effort put into it.\u201d\nVictor Dillard, another 3rd year\nChemical Engineer, outlines the overall\nproblems that face those affected by the\nblunder, arguing that, \u201cA lot of time and\neffort was put in by students to prepare\nfor this exam as there was a substantial amount of material to study. This\nexam also marked the send-off of the\n3rd year Chemical Engineering exams.\nThe cancellation forces us to reshuffle\nour revision timetables, a big inconvenience when we have nine other exams\nto prepare for, all much more difficult\nthan BfE. It seems rather disrespectful\nto the students that no care was taken\nto check that the examination paper\nwas faultless before it was handed out -very disappointing from such a highly-reputed institution.\u201d\nWith this event serving as the culmination of a year-long dissatisfaction with the BfE course, it remains\nto be seen whether there will be any\nchanges in the way the module is run\nin the future. Until then, a highly \u201cred\nfaced\u201d and repentant Business School\nis unlikely to be of any consolation to\nthose who now find themselves with\neven more unexpected revision on\ntheir plates as the examination period\nbegins in earnest.\nImperial College Business School has been accused of not paying enough attention to their engineering students\n\n"

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 07 MAY 2010\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nS\nticks and stones can break my\nbones but words can never\nhurt me.\nAh, a popular children\u2019s id-iom, especially for those who\nhad more words than stones hurled at\nthem in their formative years, but I\u2019m\nnot keen on it. For one, it\u2019s completely\nwrong, and two, far more importantly,\nit sells words short by a wide margin.\nWords have power, far more power than\nwe give them credit for.\nIt all started, as most things did, in the\ndimly lit caves of prehistory. All men\nwere equal (Women weren\u2019t, sadly).\nAs utopic as this sounds, they didn\u2019t\nget very far. Since they had no way of\ncommunicating, aside from charades\nand shadow puppet theatre, complex\ntasks like organising mammoth-hunts\nor guard-duty from hungry leopards\ndidn\u2019t really get off the ground. Our ancestors didn\u2019t know who to turn to, who\nthe brains of their operations were. Remember, this was before the invention of\nglasses. Then an outsider of the group,\nchastised for his mutation of a slimmer\ntongue, finer vocal cords, or maybe a\nnovel approach to temporal lobe archi-tecture, stood up, cleared his throat and\nsaid, \u201cExcuse me, chaps. I don\u2019t mean to\nbe a bother but I think you would have\nrather more luck with those dastardly\nMammuthus primigenius if you gave\nthem a good going over with sticks a\nmite sharper than your current arsenal.\nCan you see my, ahem, point?\u201d\nAnd thus, Language was born! With\nthe pun following close behind.\nOnce his comrades realised these\nnew-fangled words could help procure\ntheir basic living needs, they began to\nponder what else they could be used\nfor. Could they, for example, woo and\ncharm their ladyfolk to relations of a\nmore intimate nature? The answer was\nyes, and so Poetry was discovered. After\nthis, they found more and more uses for\nwords and society really kicked off. All\nthanks to some rather odd-sounding\ngrunts.\nAnd as with anything, with all their\nuses, words have their misuse. They can\nbe used to insult and demean, to hold\npeople back. From the playground to\nthe workspace, psychological bullying,\nof which words are the tools, cuts far\ndeeper than a mere pummelling. A com-ment, thrown away in spite, can worm\nits way into a person\u2019s head and heart.\nThere, it can grow and fester like a can-cer, with all the same poisonous poten-tial. You only have to pick up the Metro\nto read of someone who took their own\nlife over a tirade of taunting. That\u2019s not\nright. Words aren\u2019t meant for that.\nWith arguably less maleficence, words\ncan also be used to exclude. From the\nimpenetrable wall of jargon that renders\nthe scientist dumb and the public deaf to\nthe difficulties of asking for directions in\nFrench, instead of going between peo-ple, words get in between people. This\ncan promote social inclusion to those\nfortunate enough to speak the spiel but\nat the expense who left their phrase-books at home.\nBut words can be used to bring people together as well. Countless people\nthrough the ages have drawn spiritual\ncomfort from the religions and oral histories of their ancestors and, in more\nrecent times, football anthems. In the\npolitical sphere, the best orators and\ndemagogues throughout history have\nknown how to mould and manipulate\nthe populace with a cleverly crafted\nturn of phrase. And the greatest way of\nreaching someone is, of course, comedy.\nThis can range from the humeral malapropism (Or rather, humorous) to the\nFreudian cock-up (I mean slip-up!) to\nthe ubiquitous pun (They\u2019re infamous\n\u2013 every time I tell one, people have it in\nfor me).\nIf you\u2019re still in doubt of the power\nwords can hold, simply look to the field\nof medicine. Oh, go on \u2013 it won\u2019t bite. It\nis thought that Shakespeare coined eight\nthousand new words \u2013 that\u2019s hardly one\nchapter of even the briefest of medical\ndictionaries. Doctors boldly operate\nwith the ethos that brevity is for sis-sies. And yet most of their vocabulary\nis within one syllable of each other! But\nit\u2019s the pharmaceutical companies who\nhave taken this to a whole other level.\nEvery new drug they release has a name\nthat is half a dictionary long, utterly unpronounceable and reads like an incantation from the Necronomicon. Ph\u2019nglui\nmglw\u2019nafh Cthulhu R\u2019lyeh wgah\u2019nagl\nfhtagn...Abciximab.\nBut this barely scratches the surface.\nYou could fill a dictionary with mor-phemes, portmanteaus, syntaxes, hom-onyms, jokes, rhetoric, one-liners and\nWar and Peace. Except that\u2019s not what a\ndictionary is for. So I\u2019ll simply say this:\nCiao!\nRhysDaviesknows the power of words\n\u201cAnd as with\nanything, with all\ntheir uses, words\nhave their misuse. \u201d\nW\nell, now. Aren\u2019t I in\na bit of a position\nthis week. I\u2019m writing this pre-election,\nyou\u2019re reading this\npost-election; what to do, what to do.\nDo I rail at you for bringing in Cameron and dooming us to a future of\ndeath and dirty looks from China? Do\nI chuckle at the idealistic thought that\na hung parliament might \u201cmake them\nwork together\u201d? I\u2019m in a bind here.\nOh but you\u2019d planned ahead for this,\nhadn\u2019t you. You planned ahead by all\nacting like a riotous band of tossers\nfrom start to finish in this election\ncampaign, thus giving me this point to\nreflect on - no matter who you elect in\nthis week, you\u2019ve only gone and proved\nthat democracy in this country is one\nepic game of the blind leading the ArseElbow Differentiation Society.\nFrom the very first television debate,\nwhere you watched one man shout\nslightly louder than two other, uglier\nmen and decided that he was charismatic on that basis, every single one\nof you has done nothing but drive me\nround the fucking bend. I\u2019ve heard so\nmuch contradictory bullshit in the last\nmonth that by Friday I\u2019m expecting us\nto have seventeen different Prime Ministers, with the economy simultaneously recovering and dipping back into\nrecession. That\u2019s going to be a tough\nweekend, eh?\nBad news guys! Whoever you just\nelected, it turns out, has exactly the\nsame debt to clear, has told almost the\nsame number of lies, and cares as much\nabout your personal situation as the\ntwo guys you thought were total shit.\nThe minor points - the tax break here,\nthe immigrant-burning power stations\nthere - they\u2019re just fluff to distract you.\nThe government is going to do what\nthe government likes, and just like\nthe other three and a half years prior\nto January when you couldn\u2019t give a\ntinker\u2019s cuss, you will probably live life\noblivious to it.\nAnd I don\u2019t mind, I don\u2019t. But I have\nto sit through hours of your pseud\nbullshit, listening about how \u201cthe country\u201d either used to be a certain way,\nis a certain way, or will be a certain\nway. About how you\u2019re emigrating, or\nstaying here all your life, or wah, wah,\nwah. Just because you\u2019ve finally got to\ngrips with the big nine-letter words\nthe Economist uses doesn\u2019t mean that\nI want to inhale the second-hand opinion you\u2019ve been getting off your local\ndealer in Tescos.\nI sat revising with Lord Factshitter\nII the other day, having every attempt\nat learning a formula punctuated\nwith some comment about margin-als. Nothing gets that man hot like the\nfiery taste of single-figure percentage\nswings. Phwoar. Three-way marginal,\nyou say? You dirty, dirty electorate,\nyou.\nI\u2019m sat there wondering what this\nman does when Dimbleby isn\u2019t on the\nnews at least twice a day, and all he is\ndoing is tripping facts off about the\nLabour party. You remember that time\nlast month when that girl turned down\nan offer of naked hijinx because she\nfound out you think Lost\u2019s a bit over-rated? That was Labour\u2019s fault, it turns\nout. That time in primary school where\nyou shat yourself instead of answering\na question in front of the class? Even\nthen was the hand of the Left wing at\nwork.\nOf course, every election should\nmake people feel slightly desperate and\nhopeless about their future. If an election is particularly good, it\u2019ll also make\nyou despise the media and all those\nassociated with it. But I didn\u2019t think\nthat it could make you hate the voters\nthemselves. If ever there was an argument for despotism, then there are several hundred of them milling around\nQueen\u2019s Tower on weekdays right now.\nSo I\u2019m left feeling that whoever you\nelect on Thursday, no amount of political activism will allow me to vote in a\nnew generation of students. Sod emigrating to the States, I\u2019m off to North\nKorea. It might be a bit drab, but the\nnewspapers probably read better.\nAngryGeekcontemplatestheelections\n\u201cThe government\nis going to do what\nthe government\nlikes...and you will\nprobably live life\noblivious to it.\u201d\n\n"
