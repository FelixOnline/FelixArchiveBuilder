Imperial soon found\nthemselves a wicket down in\nthe fourth over with just four\nruns on the board, bringing\nthe skipper to the crease.\nAfter a slightly apprehensive start, both Khurrum and\nVed looked comfortable and\nset about building a partner-ship, with Khurrum pouncing on the persistent short\nline with a few cracking pull\nshots and Ved offering much-needed support at the other\nend. However, after a somewhat dubious leave, Ved was\nadjudged leg before wicket\nand found himself back in the\npavilion.\nBrijesh bought some attacking shots to the game and hit\ntwo glorious boundaries to\nforce a bowling change. After\nbeing tempted by another\nloose delivery, he was unlucky\nto be caught at mid-off after\nscoring ten quick runs.\nWith the score now on just\n34 for three after 12 overs, it\nwas imperative that Khurrum\nstayed at the crease to provide some stability. He did\njust that, whilst engineering\nthe bad balls into the gaps to\nensure that the scoreboard\nwas ticking along.\nHowever, in the 18th over,\njust after playing a glorious\ncut shot for four, Khurrum\nnicked a short one to the\nkeeper for a regulation catch.\nAlmost immediately, Imtiaz\nwas caught at point after\nplacing two glorious strokes\nto the boundary, and it looked\nlike Imperial were heading\nfor a total under 100.\nHowever, Sohaib Ali and\nAmmar Akhtar both came to\nthe crease with a somewhat\ndifferent view. Ali pounced on\nanything loose and showed\nthe fielding side a glorious\nexhibition of pinch hitting.\nAt the other end, Ammar\npulled out a selection of\nwristy strokes and some athletic running between the\nwickets. Between the two,\nthey contributed 49 runs to\nthe Imperial total, including\nseven fine boundaries.\nWith some solid contributions down the order, Imperial\nrecovered from some early jitters to post a low but respectable total of 127 all out.\nImperial\u2019s fast bowlers, led\nby Ben Evans, then produced\ninspired spells of mostly\naccurate and consistent line\nand length. The School of\nPharmacy (SOP) had begun\nbrightly but soon found themselves two wickets down as\nBen cleverly had both openers caught behind, with some\nexcellent catches from Ved.\nHowever, after losing\nanother wicket, SOP set about\nbuilding a partnership. It was\nclear that if they were going\nto win this then they would\nneed contributions from all\nthe batsmen.\nAmmar and Brijesh both\nbowled exceptional spells\nto support Ben, and were\nrewarded with wickets.\nRazza, batting at number\nthree for SOP\n, looked in fine\nform but was lucky to survive\na few close calls.\nSOP were firmly on top with\nthe score at 119 for six with 10\novers to spare, needing just\nnine runs for victory. It looked\nas if Razza had almost sealed\nthe win for the away side as\nhe middled one straight back\nat the bowler. More out of\nhope and desperation than\nanything else, Khurrum flung\nhis hand low to his left and\nwas amazed to see the ball\nstick. Suddenly, with Razza\ngone for a fine 46, Imperial\nhad a glimmer of hope.\nBrijesh then produced an\nexceptional over of full and\nstraight deliveries which\nwould have been difficult\nfor the top order to contend\nwith, let alone the tail-end-ers. He took the remaining\nwickets that Imperial so desperately wanted, and the face\nof the game had completely\nchanged.\nOn the whole, this group\nof young and inexperienced\ncricketers produced a spirited and memorable performance for Imperial. Many of\nthem were on their debuts\nand, through a bit of luck and\nsome exceptional talent, were\nrewarded with the victory.\nThis is clearly an indication\nof the strength and depth of\nability in the Imperial squad.\nThese players will not forget\ntheir debuts in a hurry.\nCRICKET\nanother wicket, SOP set about their debuts in a hurry.\nImperial cricketers line up before their narrow victory over the School of Pharmacy\nPHOTO: JIBRAN AHMED\n\n"

Anything, that is, including gratuitous hyper-violence, shoddy acting, dialogue that\u2019s cheesier\nthan fondue, and plot lines that\nare about as plausible as London\u2019s\nOlympic bid.\nSin City tracks three separate stories that take place on the decadent\nand depraved streets of Basin City.\nThe streets are lined with pimps,\nprostitutes, and drug dealers \u2013 think\neighties Manchester and you\u2019re getting there. In the central plot, Marv\n(Mickey Rourke) is out for revenge\nfor the murder of his lover, Goldie.\nIn a separate story-line, Hartigan\n(Bruce Willis) is a policeman who is\nframed and imprisoned for a crime\nhe didn\u2019t commit (a bit like The A\nTeam). In the third story, Dwight\n(Clive Owen) finds himself in the\nmiddle of a gang war after getting\nembroiled in a murder.\nThe disparate quality of the acting and direction within the three\nplot-lines damages the overall prod-uct. For example, in the third story,\nabout Dwight, Clive Owen mumbles\nhis lines in an inscrutable mono-tone. Whereas the likes of Mickey\nRourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica\nAlba seem to adapt well to Sin\nCity\u2019s unconventional comic-book\nmedium, some of the other less\nprominent actors in the movie flap\naround like fish out of water, completely out of place in Frank Miller\u2019s\nfilm neo-noir.\nSin City is also the most violent\nfilm that\u2019s spattered the cinema\nscreens for some time. It makes\nKill Bill look like The Care Bears.\nMutilation, decapitation, castration,\namputation \u2013 it\u2019s like a fight between\nBlack and Decker and Bosch in a\ncrack lounge. But given that the\nviolence is highly stylised and that\nthe film is shot almost entirely in\nblack and white, we are spared the\nrealism that would leave any permanent disturbing effect \u2013 although\na particularly impressionable friend\nadmitted he was \u2018baying for blood\u2019\non the way back (to the shock of our\nfellow passengers).\nThe trouble is that Robert\nRodriguez (like his mentor\nTarantino) sees violence as an end\nin itself. This is something that will\nput the more discerning viewers\n\u2013 the ones who look for suspense\nin movies \u2013 off watching Sin City.\nThe violence is not suspenseful, it\u2019s\npredictable and it contributes nothing of any substance to the story. If\nit wasn\u2019t for the dazzling cinematog-raphy, Jessica Alba and the fact that\nI had to write this review, I would\nprobably have left halfway through.\nIn summary, you shouldn\u2019t go into\nthe cinema with high hopes. Visually\nit\u2019s a stunning achievement, but\noverall it\u2019s not exactly Citizen Kane\nis it?\nSick City\nDarius Nikbin finds this violent thriller disappointing, despite its all-star cast\nSin City\nDirectors: Frank Miller,\nRobert Rodriguez\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke,\nJessica Alba, Clive Owen\nLength: 124 minutes\nCertificate: 18\nHIIII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cIt makes Kill Bill\nlook like The Care\nBears\u201d\nListings: page 12\nOUT THIS WEEK\nReleased on Friday 10 June at Vue\nFulham Broadway:\n\u25cf Mr & Mrs Smith\nBooking for Thursday 16 June at\nVue Fulham Broadway:\n\u25cf Batman Begins\nVisit www.myvue.com/student for\nmore details.\nVue Fulham Broadway are giving\nyou the opportunity to win a Sin\nCity or League of Gentlemen\u2019s\nApocalypse poster.

I am touched to\nhear \u2013 from our esteemed editor,\nno less \u2013 that several of you pick up\nour little paper of joy on any given\nThursday and turn straight here to\nget your disposable piece of me!\n\u2018Disposable piece of me\u2019 \u2013 onomatopoeia for an emocore band name,\ndon\u2019t you think? I should really pass\nthat on to Greasy, who has been\nemailing me non-stop this week\nabout his \u2018clart\u2019 posse.\nI would also like to thank the lovely Diogo for keeping me a secret,\nand the inimitable Aaron S for\ntaking the time out to answer my\nlovingly thought-out questions \u2013 I\nenjoyed his \u2018String Theory\u2019 column\nimmensely!\nMoving on. What else have I been\nup to? Running into a variety of hid-eosities with my partner in crime,\nBrownian motion, I do believe! A\nhideosity is cross between something hideous and a monstrosity. In\nkeeping with this theme, I\u2019ve decided to compile a list of the most hideous people in college, to keep you\nall guessing during those dreaded\nmaths methods lectures! Short of\nnaming and shaming them, we\u2019re\ngoing to leave you with a treasure\nhunt... the prize being a cold beverage shared in the presence of the\nmost excellent yours truly. Here are\nsix of the \u2018best\u2019...\nWe begin with a four foot tall,\nHuxley-based case of short-man\nsyndrome. He\u2019s also homophobic,\nwell versed in text harrassment and\nunbelievably inarticulate. Without\nthe requisite anger management\nclasses, he would have been better\nsuited to a career in suicide bomb-ing. His brother, the curry breath\ngreaseball from EEE, also gets a\nmention. We finally met up with him\nafter months of painstaking emails\nsaying, \u201cplease meet me, you won\u2019t\nknow if you hate me \u2018til you try\u201d.\nSo we did. We took him to the\nScience Museum, since no-one we\nknew would be hanging out there\nat 2pm on a Thursday. Believe me,\nhe was highly embarassing to be\nseen with \u2013 a two-foot tall, fully-bearded old-school hair metaller\ndoes nobody any social favours! His\nattempts to claim the Lostprophets\nas Britain\u2019s biggest rock band fell\nflat on our unreceptive ears.\nOur next hideosity is more refined.\nThis ICT worker actually pronounced his occupation as a \u2018pergammer\u2019 (programmer). Spitting\nrelentlessly as he talked, we lasted\n45 minutes before giving up on this\nabsolute gem.\nNext up is another Mech Enger.\nOf Asian origin, he has taken a leaf\nfrom the books of the sleazes most\ncommonly found in Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nmarket. I\u2019m sorry, but just because\nI\u2019m brown does not mean I\u2019m from\nyour country of origin. It also does\nnot mean that I\u2019ll automatically love\nyou. Setting foot in Chelsea does\nnot suddenly make you rich. Even\nif it did, you\u2019d still not be desirable.\nBelieve me, if I was going to marry\nfor money, it certainly wouldn\u2019t be\nto a man whose hobbies include\nchirpsing brown females and getting sweaty patches in the middle of\nhis pink Ralph Lauren polo shirts...\nNumber two in our \u2018chart\u2019 is the\ninfamous Erection Man, famous\nfor grinding against unsuspecting\nfemales in the union. Not only does\nhe gyrate, but he gets full blown\nerections from it. Many of us have\nbeen unfortunate enough to be dancing merrily before turning around\non feeling something small and hard\non our bums.

Despite porn being so\nomnipresent in our lives and on our\ncomputer screens, porn comes up\nvery rarely in conversation. I guess\nyou\u2019d have to be pretty good friends\nwith someone to say, \u201cI found this\ngreat new porn site the other day,\nit\u2019s got everything...\u201d\nPorn is defiantly losing the stigma\nthat has been associated with it in\nthe past. Its stars are now rightly\nproud of their assets and achieve-ments. In the past, some famous\nactors have had to dabble in the\nporn world to keep their finances in\nthe black. Once they become mainstream movie stars, the threat of\n\u2018revelations\u2019 hangs over their heads.\nBut exposure through porn can give\nporn actors celebrity status in their\nown right \u2013 see Jemma Jameson\nand John Holmes, for example. The\nporn world also has its own version of the Oscars, the AVN awards,\nwhich are held at some of the plushest hotels in Las Vegas and San\nFrancisco.\nStrictly for research purposes, I\nhad a quick look at the myriad of\ndifferent types of porn that are available on the internet. There is a\nwhole plethora of different types of\nporn available. You would have to\nhave some truly bizarre interests\nto not find your niche somewhere.\nUnfortunately, no matter how hard I\ntried, I couldn\u2019t find any true scientist porn. There were lots of nurses,\nfiremen, nuns and teachers, but\nabsolutely no lab coat related stimu-lation.\nThe nice thing about porn is that\nyou can be as specific as you like.\nFor instance, you don\u2019t have to wade\nthrough a sea of ginger people if you\nlike \u2018em blonde. If you have a fetish\nfor golden showers or S&M there\nare multiple sites that will give you\nexactly what you want without you\nhaving to ask.\nI don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me to list all the types\nof truly depraved porn in the hallowed pages of Felix. Suffice to say,\nyou can get some truly weird and\n\u2018I\u2019m surpised that\u2019s physically possible\u2019 stuff. This got me wondering whether these niche activities\nexisted before the internet revolu-tion. I know there are sex shops\nand stuff, but I can\u2019t see how there\ncan possibly be enough demand for\nsome of the truly bizarre. So, have\npeople always been turned on by\nthese \u2018activities\u2019 or has the internet\ncaused the creation of scores of new\ncrazes?\nThe internet must have increased\nporn usage by several orders of mag-nitude. According to Men\u2019s Health\nmagazine, roughly one quarter of\nall web searches are porn-related.\nI imagine most of the population\nhas a bit of a dabble in porn, but\naren\u2019t so into it that they go out\nactively seeking it. The internet\nserves these people excellently\n\u2013 if you\u2019re a bit bored or horny you\ncan have a Google and sort yourself out without heading down to\nSoho, where you have to quell those\nnerves and ask the motherly-look-ing woman for a magazine, the title\nof which you hope your mum has\nnever heard of.\nInternet porn does, obviously, have\nits down sides, child porn being the\nmajor one and far too serious an\nissue for discussion here. Addiction\nis another \u2013 I\u2019ve got a friend (this\nisn\u2019t a friend who is actually me)\nwho was seriously worried internet\nporn had caused him to fail his\nexams. His explanation? \u201cRevision\nis boring, porn isn\u2019t.\u201d However\nfunny it may sound, porn addiction can become a serious problem,\nwith men spending countless hours\nonline to the detriment of their families and jobs.\nPorn itself is but a tool and tools\nare completely neutral \u2013 it\u2019s their\napplication that renders them good\nor bad.\n4th floor library dude\nI would like to apologise for any\ndistress that may have been caused\nby my previous column, \u20184th floor\nlibrary dude\u2019.

What\ndo you do?\nIn some circumstances, people think\nthat they can juggle personal problems\nwith academic work. Some people can\ndo this, but most can\u2019t. When a close\nfamily member or friend is ill, or perhaps even dies, it is very hard for us\nall to concentrate on our jobs, and we\noften cannot carry out our usual tasks\nto the best of our ability.\nSometimes departments can make\nmistakes in their procedures, for\nexample the wrong revision notes\nmay be given to you or you might be\ntold the wrong location or time for an\nexam. These situations do sometimes\narise and they are known as procedural irregularities.\nIf either of these situations, or\nsomething similar, happens to you,\nit is always important to talk in the\nfirst instance to your department.\nSometimes a senior or personal tutor\nis a good start, but who else could you\ntalk to?\nThe Information and Advice Centre\n(IAC) is here to act as an independent and impartial ear to all students\nwho find themselves in this type of\nawkward situation. We are totally confidential and can give you options as to\nthe best way forward.\nIn some circumstances, students\ncarry out an exam with this sort of\nproblem hanging over them and then\nafterwards realise that it affected their\nperformance. In this situation, you may\nbe able to launch an academic appeal\non the basis of extenuating circum-stances. To do this you will need good\nevidence, so for example if you had an\nillness you would need to provide doctor\u2019s notes or proof of a hospital stay.\nIt is easier to resolve if you bring these\nissues up before exams or coursework\nhas to be handed in.\nWith procedural irregularities, again\nyou will have to have proof of this on\npaper. The IAC can help you with all\nthese issues by ensuring that you have\nenough evidence to proceed.\nIf you do wish to appeal when you\nreceive your results, it is important to\nthink about this long and hard before\ndoing so. Consider the following:\n\u2022 What basis are you appealing on?\n\u2022 Have you got the evidence to support\nyour appeal on paper?\n\u2022 Will you be any better off if you win\nthe appeal?\n\u2022 What result do you want to see hap-pen, and is it likely to be the outcome?\n\u2022 Are the department willing to give\nyou another chance anyway?\nIt is important to remember that you\ncannot appeal just because you are\nunhappy with the mark. Papers are\noften marked two or three times, so if\nthe mark was wrong it would almost\ncertainly have been noticed by now.\nIn all cases, be honest with yourself.\nIf you honestly feel that you have a\ncase then proceed, but if you just didn\u2019t\ndo enough revision then your appeal\nwill be thrown out at the first level.\nThe IAC is currently producing an\ninformation sheet as a guide for students on how to appeal and the possible outcomes that can occur.\nIf you would like more information\non academic appeals, please contact\nthe Information and Advice Centre on\n020 7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\nRemember, don\u2019t let your concern\nturn into a crisis. Make the Information\nand Advice Centre your one stop shop\nfor all your welfare issues.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nDeath in vain?\nYesterday was the cremation of Apijak\n\u2018Joe\u2019 Srivannavit, the Imperial postgraduate who was killed in an accident\nwhilst cycling at the Queen\u2019s Gate\njunction with Cromwell Road. Coming\na couple of months after the death of\na long-serving staff member, Thomas\nSippel-Dau, on the same road, it\u2019s\na poignant time to think about road\nsafety in the area.\nThere have long been concerns\nabout the safety of Cromwell Road,\nfor pedestrians as well as cyclists.\nFurthermore, there is an air quality\nmonitoring station which shows it to\nbe the most polluted road in London.\nThe Union is seeking to raise political awareness of the road safety and\nenvironment issues with the Cromwell\nRoad. The issue is complicated\nbecause the main road is the responsibility of the Mayor and Transport\nfor London whilst the adjacent roads\ncome under the jurisdiction of the local\ncouncils. Nevertheless, the nature of\nrecent events means that it is now a\ncause we must champion on behalf\nof the local community (of which we\nare a major component). Joe\u2019s family\nhave expressed their support for our\ncampaign. To find out more, or to help,\nplease visit www.union.ic.ac.uk/icbug.\nRadio controversy\nI know there are several controversial\nissues bubbling up that people want\nto talk to me about. I get a lot of email\nand it can be difficult for me to reply to\neach and every person who emails me\nabout something. So I thought it might\nbe worth drawing attention to the fact\nthat you can phone in to Fireside, my\nradio show with Dave Edwards, the\neditor of Felix. We are on air every\nThursday, 5-6pm on 999AM in Princes\nGardens, 1134AM in Wye and at www.\nicradio.com.\nRequests\nI know that next week will be my last\ncolumn after serving two years as your\nPresident. I expect to write about the\nfuture of the Union and Imperial as a\nwhole, as well as what I have learnt\nin my six years as a student here. If\nthere\u2019s anything you think I should\nwrite about, then please email me\n(president@ic.ac.uk) to let me know.\nAlternatively email Felix as they are\ngoing to interview me.\nElection time\nPlease don\u2019t forget that we have\nelection nominations open for Union\nOfficers as well as the new Graduate\nStudents\u2019 Association. Nominations\nclose on Monday 13 June and voting\ntakes place online later that week.\nULU success\nAs I hope you are aware by now,\nImperial students are members of the\nUniversity of London Union (ULU)\nas well as ICU. ULU organise central\ncampaigns and every other year or so\none of them actually achieves some-thing. This is one of those years.\nFrom September 2005 all students\nwill be able to use the University of\nLondon Library (ULL) in Senate\nHouse which has an extensive collection of humanities and social sciences\ntexts. Up until now, only students from\nthose Colleges which subscribed to\nthe ULL could use it. That excluded\nImperial as we didn\u2019t subscribe since\nthe ULL does not maintain any specialist science collections. Nevertheless,\nthe ULL is valuable as study space for\nImperial students who live in intercollegiate halls in the area. It is also\nincredibly valuable for anyone who\nwants access to a broader collection\nof humanities texts (especially those\ntaking humanities for credit). Credit\nmust go to ULU for this.\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nLocal community must learn\nfrom cyclists\u2019 deaths\nO\nur thoughts go out to the friends and family of Apijak\nSrivannavit, the Imperial College postgraduate student who\nwas killed in a road traffic accident in South Kensington two\nweeks ago. He was knocked off his bicycle by a coach at the junction\nof Queen\u2019s Gate and Cromwell Road [see last week\u2019s Felix, issue\n1325].\nMr Srivannavit was not the first person from Imperial College\nto suffer a tragic death while cycling in the area. Less than three\nmonths ago, Thomas Sippel-Dau, an ICT manager, was knocked off\nhis bicycle and killed by a 4x4 vehicle in a hit-and-run incident.\nOne death could be seen as an anomaly, but two in such a short\nspace of time suggest that something is seriously wrong on Cromwell\nRoad. It is a long, straight route, where drivers appear to break the\nspeed limit very frequently, perhaps as a result of the fact that many\ncome in from the west on the M4 and fail to realise that they need to\nslow down.\nImperial College and its students\u2019 union should put pressure on\nthe local council and Transport for London in order to protect those\nwho cycle in the area. Any number of traffic calming measures could\nbe introduced, perhaps on a trial basis initially. These would also\nimprove safety for drivers and pedestrians. There is no doubt that\nthe status quo must not be allowed to continue.\nThe local community must learn from the deaths of Mr Srivannavit\nand Mr Sippel-Dau, doing all it can to prevent further tragedies.\nImperial College Bicycle Users\u2019 Group has information on how you\ncan help at www.union.ic.ac.uk/icbug/cromwell.html.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 June 2005 5\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe UK is facing a carbon\nparadox. As the Government\nstrives to cut carbon dioxide\nemissions by 60% by 2050, the\ndemand for energy is increasing and so too is our dependence on carbon dioxide-pro-ducing power stations.\nOver the next 20 years,\nalmost all our existing nuclear power stations and most\ncoal-fired power stations will\nclose as they reach the end\nof their operating lives. Then,\nthe UK will have to rely on\nimported energy such as gas\nand oil, often from politically\nunstable countries. To reduce\nour reliance on imports, the\nGovernment has invested in\nrenewable energy sources\nsuch as wind power, which\npromise cleaner energy without the carbon emissions.\nWind farms are high on\nthe Government\u2019s agenda.\nControversial wind turbines\nhave sprung up across\nBritain\u2019s countryside and\nthere are plans for a further\n2,000 by 2010 at a total cost of\naround \u00a39bn. Despite being\n\u2018green\u2019, wind turbines have\nmet with considerable resist-ance. Opponents argue they\nare ruining some of Britain\u2019s\nbest-loved landscapes and\nare an unreliable source of\nenergy.\nOne such critic, David\nAnderson, who chairs the\nenergyboardattheInstitution\nof Civil Engineers, refutes\nthe claim that wind power\nwill reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. He calculates that\nturbines could only reduce\nBritain\u2019s greenhouse gas\nemissions by a maximum of\n5%.\nThere are alternatives:\nanother solution to curb\nemissions and maintain a\nreliable energy supply would\nbe to clean up the act of the\nwell-established coal derived\nenergy.\nCoal-fuelled power stations\ncurrently supply 30% of the\nUK\u2019s electricity. Equally, they\nare responsible for releasing over a third of the total\ncarbon dioxide produced in\nBritain. Coal is easy to store\nand transport, and is accessible from diverse suppliers\nboth here and abroad. Loads\nin coal-fired stations can\nalso be varied easily, so coal-fired generation is particularly useful in meeting peak\ndemand or covering for supply intermittencies in other\nfuels. Developing cleaner\ncoal that releases less carbon\ndioxide would therefore have\nhuge benefits.\nVarious clean coal technologies already exist and aim to\nuse coal in an environmentally friendly and economic way.\nClean coal can be achieved\neither by targeting the pollutants that result from burning\ncoal, or by developing more\nthermally efficient systems\nso that less coal generates\nthe same power. There are\nalso improved techniques for\ngas cleaning, effluent treatment and residue use or dis-posal.\nA new possibility is the\ndevelopment of ultra-clean\ncoal. \u201cUltra-clean coal is seen\nas something of a Holy Grail\nin energy generation,\u201d said\nDr Karen Steel of the School\nof Chemical Environmental\nand Mining Engineering,\nUniversity of Nottingham.\n\u201cIt is a very efficient way of\nproducing electricity and it is\nalso much less harmful for the\nenvironment.\u201d Her team have\njust been awarded \u00a3120,000\nto help them kick start the\ndevelopment of ultra-clean\ncoal which they believe could\nmake power generation 50%\nmore efficient and reduce\ncarbon dioxide release by a\nthird.\nMined coal contains about\n15% mineral matter including sulphates, oxides, clays,\nquartz and carbonates, which\nrestrict its use. By definition,\nultra clean coals are coals\nwith less than 1% ash and\nfrom which naturally occurring minerals have been\nremoved by chemical clean-ing.\nCSIRO (the Commonwealth\nScientific and Industrial\nResearch Organisation) in\nAustralia is the only other\norganisation looking into the\nmanufacture of ultra-clean\ncoal. They have invested\n$15m into a pilot-scale ultra-clean coal operation that\nhas already yielded positive results demonstrating a\nreduction in greenhouse gas\nemissions.\nThe ultra-clean coal process developed by CSIRO\nutilises alkali/acid digestion\nto dissolve the minerals out\nof the coal under moderate\ntemperature and pressure\nconditions, without the loss\nof coal\u2019s properties. The dissolved minerals are then\nprecipitated as gypsum and\naluminium silicates, which\nare used in the building and\nceramics industries, while\nthe alkalis are regenerated\nfor reuse.\nDr Steel and her team are\nhoping to develop a similar chemical leaching process that has the potential to\nreduce the mineral content\nof coal to less than 0.1%. This\nensures a much greater efficiency per tonne of coal and\nup to a third less carbon dioxide pollution.\nMost conventional coal-fired power stations burn\ncoal to produce steam, which\nturns turbines linked to a\ngenerator. This process is\nonly around 37% efficient,\nwhich means just over a third\nof the energy potential of the\ncoal is converted into elec-tricity. Unlike normal coal,\nultra-clean coal can be burnt\ndirectly in gas turbines. Gas\nturbines are similar to aircraft jet engines and are a\nmuchmore efficient way of\nusing coal to make electricity\n\u2013 but normal coal cannot be\nused in them because their\nimpurities damage the turbine blades. Ultra-clean coal\nis therefore around 50% more\nefficient than normal coal.\nCommenting on the cost of\nimplementing this new tech-nology, Dr Steel said: \u201cThere\nhas been an assumption that\nit would be too expensive to\nproduce ultra-clean coal. But\nour aim is to do it cheap, so\nthe coal will sell at about the\nusual price.\u201d\nUltra-clean coal could\nalso help reduce the world\u2019s\ndependence on oil, according\nto Dr Steel. There are greater untapped reserves of coal,\nand they are generally located away from the politically\nturbulent Middle East. For\nexample, China and the USA\nboth have large reserves of\ncoal, but not much oil. Coal\nwill also remain the dominant generating fuel in large\nparts of the developing world\nsuch as China and India for\nmany years to come. This\ncould be beneficial for UK\nindustry, which could develop\nbusiness initiatives to promote and install cleaner coal\ntechnologies in developing\ncountries.\nUltra-clean coal also will\nbe up against nuclear power.\nThe zero carbon emissions\nassociated with nuclear\nplants are proving tempting\nfor the re-elected govern-ment. But nuclear power stations tend to generate electricity at the same rate all\nthe time. This would provide\na baseline rate of power, but\nwould be too inflexible to deal\nwith sharp fluctuations in\nconsumer demand. The age-old problem of storing radioactive waste has also yet to\nbe solved.\nEvery method of energy\nproduction has its pitfalls.\nThe only way the country can\nkeep up with the increasing\nenergy demand is to ensure\ndiversity in energy produc-tion, some renewable, some\nnot. Although people were\nquick to reject fossil fuels as\ndirty fuels in favour of greener more renewable sources,\nultra-clean coal could ensure\nthat coal is back in the game.\nThe clean coal revolution\nGreen energy may not have to be renewable. Forget wind and solar power, ultra-clean coal may now\nbe the future for cleaner air. Emma-Lynn Donadieu investigates\nClean coal: a non-renewable solution to the energy crisis?\n\u201cUltra-clean coals are\ncoals with less than\n1% ash and from which\nnaturally occurring\nminerals have been\nremoved\u201d\n\u201cUltra-clean coal is\nseen as something of\na Holy Grail in energy\ngeneration\u201d\nLeave your anti-gravity books at the door\nIn levitating frogs, scientists achieved both the almost impossible and the completely useless.\nTom Simonite looks at new research that may lead to a more useful applications of levitation\n\u201cWhat we want to do, for\na number of reasons, is to\nmake things float in mid-air,\u201d\nexplains Peter King, a man\nwhose job is to defy gravity.\nIt sounds amazing, and he\u2019s\ngetting better at it. This month\nthe latest refinements to his\ntechnique were released,\nalong with video footage of\nchunks of platinum, lead and\npound coins floating freely in\na glass jar. As a result he\u2019s\nbeen in demand \u2013 national\nnewspapers were interested,\ntelevision networks even travelled across the Atlantic.\nBut King thinks they missed\nthe point: \u201cYou say you can\nfloat something using a magnetic field, and ten minutes\nlater it\u2019s \u2018scientists discover\nan antigravity machine\u2019. This\nis not quite what we\u2019ve done\n\u2013 we\u2019re not having free trips\nto Mars tomorrow in our anti-gravity machine.\u201d\nSo just what has King\u2019s\nresearch group at the\nUniversity of Nottingham\ndone? When he tells the story\nhis way, it emerges that an\nelegant piece of research has\nlargely been ignored in favour\nof the allure of the word \u2018levitation\u2019 and myths of antigrav-ity skateboards.\nIt turns out that levitation is\nactually nothing new \u2013 water,\nstrawberries and frogs have\nall been levitated before using\na phenomenon called diamag-netism, as King explained:\n\u201cDiamagnetic materials absolutely hate magnetic fields\nand experience a force driving them out of them.\u201d This\nforce can balance out gravity\nand make things levitate, but\nonly up to a density like that\nof water. This limits the usefulness of levitation, but in\n2003 King\u2019s group improved\non this by harnessing an\nopposite effect.\nIt is another electromagnetic phenomenon\n\u2013 paramagnetism \u2013 that is the\nopposite of diamagnetism.\nParamagnetic materials are\nstrongly attracted to a magnetic field, and liquid oxygen\nis one example. King found\nthat it could strongly enhance\nlevitation \u2013 as it strives to get\nclose to the electromagnet,\nthe liquid gas displaces the\nfloating material even higher.\nMuch denser materials like\ndiamond, platinum and lead\ncould now be levitated.\nThis was a major step for-ward, but with a potentially\ndangerous catch. Liquid oxy-gen, rocket fuel, is massively\nexplosive. It made levitation\nmuch more useful and dra-matic, but its volatility rendered applications outside\nthe lab unimaginable. The\nreal story of King\u2019s recent\nresults is that he has solved\nthis potentially explosive\nproblem.\nThe secret is using a mixture of liquid gases. Oxygen\nis still used, but diluted to one\npart in eight by calmer nitro-gen: \u201cYou can actually dilute\noxygen a lot and still float\nthings pretty well. It\u2019s clean\ntoo \u2013 nitrogen and oxygen in\nthose proportions is just air.\nIf we lose that back into the\natmosphere, nobody shouts\nat us.\u201d\nSafe, clean levitation of\ndense objects allows more\nuseful applications than making frogs \u2018air sick\u2019. First in\nline is the mining industry\n\u2013 levitating metals or gems\noffers a more efficient way\nof separating them from soil.\nThis is the real tale of King\u2019s\nlatest research. Levitation\nis in the end, perhaps liter-ally, too down to earth for the\nmedia circus, but hearing the\ndetails of this story from the\nhorse\u2019s mouth beats sci-fi\nspeculation hands down.\nLevitation: no longer the stuff of magic shows\n\n"

To what extent\nand in what direction are sci-ence, engineering and technology in the UK influenced\nby the military support they\nreceive? What are the ethical issues involved? And is a\nweapons-based, hi-tech military agenda the best way to\nimprove global security?\nOn Wednesday 11 May the\nRoyal Institution hosted a\ndebate that took as its starting point the fact that about\na third of all public spending\non UK research and development (R&D) stems from the\nMinistry of Defence. Dr Chris\nLangley, author of the report\nSoldiers in the Laboratory\npublished by Scientists for\nGlobal Responsibility (SGR)\nin January 2005, Malcolm\nSavidge, former Labour MP\nfor Aberdeen North, and\nProfessor Ron Smith, economist at Birkbeck College,\npicked apart the complex sci-ence-military relationship to\nconsider its implications at a\ntime when defence expenditures are creeping up to Cold\nWar levels.\nMilitary involvement in\nR&D is by no means a recent\nphenomenon. Nor are the\nmoral and ethical dilemmas\nthat surround it. Chair David\nDickson, Director of scidev.\nnet, opened the evening with\na pointed reminder of the\nManhattan Project, which\ngenerated both military success and protest movements.\nWith an election just gone\nand Iraq still weighing heavy\non the agenda, the Trident\nNuclear Programme up for\ndiscussion and the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty to\nundergo its five-year review\nthis month, the role of science and technology in the\npursuit of military objectives\nhas risen to prominence once\nagain.\nLangleyisworried.Hisshort\ntalk drew attention to the calls\nfor increased spending on\nmilitary technology outlined\nin the White Paper Delivering\nSecurity in a Changing World.\nHis greatest concern is that a\ngrowing reliance on technology in the national security\nagenda tends to favour armed\nintervention over diplomacy\nas a means to resolve con-flict. Funding and expertise\nare pouring into military\nsolutions, diverting resources\naway from research into the\nunderlying causes of wars,\nsuch as poverty and climate\nchange. The UK\u2019s pursuit of a\nhi-tech, weapons-based military agenda like that of the\nUS is not making the world a\nsafer place.\nOn this, Malcolm Savidge\nseemed to agree. Although\nhe defended Labour\u2019s track\nrecord on defence with examples such as stronger export\ncontrol on UK arms sales,\nhe traced current policy to a\ndebatable desire to stay close\nto the US and erase the \u2018Old\nLabour\u2019 image. Criticising\nBush for his positive stance\non nuclear power, Savidge\nintroduced the eternal problem of dual use: civil technology can be adapted to military\npurposes and vice versa.\nProfessor Ron Smith took\nthis concept one step further.\nThe economist argued that a\ndistinction between science\nwith military potential and\nthat without is impossible.\nIn an entertaining anecdote,\nhe related how Louis Fry\nRichardson, a Quaker and\nmeteorologist, fled to psychology when there was mention of using his work to study\nthe diffusion of poison gas.\nDecades later, the mathematical models he subsequently\ndeveloped are the very foundations of any War Studies\ncourse. In any case, Smith\nreminded listeners, the military is increasingly buying\ncommercially available technology off the shelf instead of\ninvesting in basic research.\nBut our inability to slot\nmilitary and civilian science\ninto separate boxes does not\nfree scientists, universities\nand government from ethical\nresponsibility. Smith emphasised that history has delivered the scientist as patriot\nas well as the conscientious\nobjector. The speakers concurred that universities\u2019\nincreasingly commercial outlook has facilitated military\npartnerships in recent years.\nThe MoD continues to spit\nout \u201csmall islands of information in a sea of blather,\u201d\nas Langley eloquently put it.\nThere is a need for transparency and accountability\namong scientists, universities\nand government. It\u2019s only global security at stake.\n\u201c...a growing\nreliance on technology\nin the national security\nagenda favours armed\nintervention over\ndiplomacy to resolve\nconflict\u201d\nScientist or soldier?

    "content": "EXHIBITION\nThe sixties and seventies formed a\nperiod of renaissance. It was an era\nof change, engraved onto modern\nculture forever because of its trademark \u2018hippy\u2019 culture. Therefore, art,\nbeing a form of expression of society,\nunderwent some changes as well.\nThe common perception of art is\nrestricted to those of oil paintings,\nsculptures and sketches. However,\nin the seventies, artists rebelled\nagainst those traditional views and\nventured into different forms of\nmedia such as installations, photog-raphy, performance, film and video\nto express their ideas about the\nchanges in their world.\nWith the emergence of computers\nand binary code systems, the world\nseemed to have evolved into a simple and organised system governed\nby mathematical principles. And so\nthis exhibition opens with a look at\nthe cube as a form of art. A cube\nis basically perfect by geometric\nlaws; the world simplified by scientific discoveries and technological\nprogress could be seen as a cube.\nArtists rebelled against this idea.\nA striking example of the rebellion would be Measurement: Room\n(1969) by American artist Mel\nBochner. A room is mapped out by\nblack tape and the height and width\nof the room are indicated. However,\nthe values given for the height,\nlength and width are nonsensical;\nthe piece challenges viewers to think\nout of the box. It makes the viewers\nrethink the real meaning behind\nman-made measurements and leads\nthem to reconsider the efficacy of\nefforts to understand the universe\nthrough science and mathematics.\nNewspapers, magazines, televi-sionandencyclopaediashavealways\nbeen relied upon as sources of infor-mation. This exhibition includes a\npiece by Andy Warhol called Mao\nTse Tung (1972). In this creation,\nthe picture of the late Communist\nleader is repeated in various garish shades. This picture is a common poster picture placed all over\nChina at the time to inspire people\nto conform to the rules of com-munism. However, it is infamous\nbecause of the attacks communism\nreceived from the international\nmedia. The artist is challenging\nits credibility and our dependence\non these sources of information.\nPerhaps the most melancholic\npiece in this exhibition is a video\nrecorded by the Dutch-born artist\nBas Jan Ader. He recorded systematic acts of failure such as falling\nout of a tree into a canal repeatedly.\nWhat is strikingly highlighted in this\nwork is the inevitable tragedy that\nall man-made systems are imperfect and fallible. It also serves as a\nreminder, that in our search for control over different aspect of our lives,\nwe will always be powerless to some\nforce or fate or chaos that will always\nhave the upper hand in our destinies.\nContemporary art has always\nbeen a challenging field. However,\nthis exhibition is a worthwhile\nvisit. Not only does it amaze you\nwith the creativity these artists\nhave employed to express their\nideas, but it also challenges you\nand makes you reconsider truths\nyou have always taken for granted.\nConsidering the summer holidays\nare starting soon, art aficionados\nand newbies alike should consider\npopping in to the Tate Modern for\na little life-changing experience!\nOpen Systems:\nRethinking Art c.1970\nLevel 4\nTate Modern\nBankside, SE1\nEnds 18 September\nTickets: \u00a35.50 students, \u00a37 full price\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 June 2005 13\nSummertime\nThe sublime, the bizarre, the curious and the intriguing all on show at the Royal Academy\nThat seventies show\nAngela Lee digs beyond the off-putting title for some contemporary art\nEXHIBITION\nDespite the rather tragically cold\nstart to June, there is some sign\nthat summer is indeed on its way,\nalbeit very slowly. Every year, the\nbeginning of June brings the opening of the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer\nExhibition, which, predictably, lasts\nfor the summer period, closing in\nmid-August. This instalment is the\n237th in a tradition that began in the\nyear of the Academy\u2019s foundation,\n1768.\nThe exhibition is the world\u2019s\nlargest where anyone can submit\nwork for inclusion. Vast volumes of\nwork are submitted every year, and\nonly a fraction of it makes the cut.\nPieces by established artists and\nmembers of the academy are displayed alongside the efforts of much\nlesser known or even completely\nunknown artists. The best of the\nart that does not make the cut at\nthe Royal Academy is on show at\nthe Llewellyn Alexander Gallery in\nWaterloo. These are the 1200 best\nof the 8000 refused by the Royal\nAcademy on display and for sale at\nthe creatively titled \u2018NOT The Royal\nAcademy: A Salon des Refus\u00e9s\u2019 running until the end of August.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s Summer\nExhibition is \u2018Multiples\u2019, referring to\nprintmaking and related art forms.\nFortunately, this year\u2019s theme has\nlead to a somewhat more satisfying collection of art than last year\u2019s\nrather underperforming \u2018Drawing\u2019\ntheme. Despite the allocation of a\ntheme to every exhibition, there will\nalways be the full range of media\non show. Paintings, sculpture, draw-ings, etchings, prints and architectural drawings and models of a wide\nvariety of sizes are all there to be\nseen.\nWhat the addition of the \u2018theme\u2019\naspect of the exhibition allows the\ncurators to do is to showcase some\nof the best of one particular form\nof artistic expression. This year,\none was expecting some striking\nand intriguing images, which are\nafter all what one would expect\nfrom a medium that has so recently\nreceived its revival, and this was\nindeed delivered. The exhibition\u2019s\nfirst room was dedicated to prints\nprincipally by artists from the US.\nThe Weston Rooms are traditionally given over to prints, and here\ntoo some interesting works were on\ndisplay.\nHowever, after the first few rooms\nof the exhibition, the \u2018Multiples\u2019\ntheme had pretty much flown out\nof the proverbial window, which\ndoes beg the question, why bother\nwith the theme at all? However,\nthis departure was not unappreci-ated, particularly as I happen to like\nsculpture and large canvases coated\nin completely abstract splodges of\ncolour, which the Royal Academy\nvery obligingly provides every year.\nUnfortunately, while this year\u2019s\nofferings are much more substantial\nthan last year\u2019s drivel, the question\nof how on earth the judges select\nthe contents of the exhibition does\nalways raise its ugly head. There are\nalways strong pieces on show that\nmay not be to everyone\u2019s taste but\nclearly show passion, creativity or\na powerful statement and comment\non life and society if not all of the\nabove, but there also some things\nthat do make you wonder about the\nselection criteria. Paola Smith\nArts Editor\nSummer Exhibition 2005\nRoyal Academy\nPiccadilly, W1\nEnds 15 August\nTickets: \u00a35 students, \u00a37 full price\nNOT The Royal Academy\nLlewellyn Alexander Gallery\nThe Cut, SE1\nEnds 27 August\n\u201cHe recorded systematic acts of failure\nsuch as falling into a\ncanal repeatedly...\u201d\nCondensation Cube, Hans Haacker (1963)\n\u25cf If contemporary art really isn\u2019t\nyour thing, and neither is modern art, we would suggest the new\nJoshua Reynolds exhibition at the\nTate Britain: Joshua Reynolds:\nThe Creation of Celebrity. This\nExhibition also runs until 18\nSeptember and explores the\nart of Reynolds, one of the Royal\nAcademy\u2019s founding fathers, and his\nimpact on the birth of the cult of the\ncelebrity. Tickets for the exhibition\nare priced \u00a35.50 for students and \u00a37\nfor those unfortunate enough to be\npaying full price. Evidently, the Tate\ngalleries all employ a standardised\ncharging scheme.\nHeading back east down the river,\nthere is also now a new installation\nin the Turbine Hall to be experi-enced, the work of the architects\nHerzog and de Meuron. This exhibition is definitely a little less infuriating than the last that graced the\nTurbine Hall and should appeal to\nall artistic tastes and preferences.\nOne Night Only, Allen Jones (2003). This is a sparkling example of a\npiece that makes people question the sanity of the exhibition\u2019s judges\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 9 June 2005\n18\nVirgins trounced\nWomen\u2019s Sevens\nImperial 0-35 Brunel II\nImperial 0-35 UCL\nImperial 0-55 Brunel I\nImperial 0-45 Wye\nBy Wonkey\nOne groggy Sunday morn-ing, six die-hard (or perhaps\nfoolish) Virgins were to be\nfound outside Beit Quad at\n9am. Dappy wins the Random\nAward for coming back all\nthe way from Cardiff, only\nto decide she didn\u2019t want to\ncome with us on our lovely\nday out in the country after\nall.\nWe finally assembled an\nunlikely sevens line-up (there\nwere six of us) and established that the rest of the\nVirgins were blind drunk,\nill or otherwise in absentia\n(all three, in one particular\ncase). We set off for UCL\n\u2019s\nground near St Albans (well,\nnear a motorway), via a ticket\nmunching train and a vaguely\ndodgy \u00a313 taxi ride.\nOn arrival, captain Felix\nhad arranged for a UCL\nplayer to join us, and we\ntook stock of the situation.\nThere were four other teams:\nBrunel Firsts (wearing their\nEngland women\u2019s rugby jack-ets), Brunel Seconds, UCL\nand our dear old friends from\nWye. Our slight discomfort\nat the appearance of teams\nwith substitutes and coaches\nwas heightened further by the\nsight of John Sykes (the Royal\nSchool of Mines President)\nstrolling across the pitch looking suspiciously like he was\ngoing to be referee. Sadly he\ndeclined our request for some\ncoaching assistance, so we\ntook it upon ourselves to try\nto educate Armitage in time\nfor her first ever match.\nThe first match against\nBrunel Seconds went reasonably well. The Virgins put\nup a good fight, with a lot\nof commitment in defence,\nbut the attack took longer to\ngel. Brunel outplayed us with\nseven tries, although had we\ndrawn them later when we\nhad woken up we would have\nput some points on the board.\nUCL were a step up from\nthe previous game, but an\nimproved effort from the\nVirgins meant the scoreline\nwas similar. Felix changed\nthe penalty-taking tactics\nfrom the usual tap-and-go to\nWonkey kicking downfield for\ntouch, which slowed the game\ndown and enabled us to make\nmore ground. Again the team\nshowed huge commitment in\ndefence, but couldn\u2019t break\nthrough UCL\n\u2019s defensive line.\nBrunel Firsts were the\nteam of the tournament,\nfinishing a totally expected\nfirst overall. After listening\nto John\u2019s sage advice before\nkick-off, the Virgins \u201ckept it\nin the forwards\u201d with a huge\nteam effort, and managed to\ncontain the Brunel girls better than any other team in the\nfirst half. This may have been\nhelped by the intimidating\nnature of the Virgins scrum,\nwhich caused a quiet expletive from the Brunel forwards\nwhen we first packed down \u2013\n6\u20192\u201d locks Felix and Armitage\nmoving to prop, budging usual\nlooseheadWonkey(veryheavy\nbut not as tall) to hooker \u2013 a\nsight that even Men\u2019s Firsts\nCaptain Hixxy called \u201cscary\u201d\nwhen presented with it in\nSouthside.\nThe backline also pushed\nup well in defence, with notable tackles from all three\nImperial backs, Thumper\n(aka Bambi), Tumbles and\nCherrypicker, who also managed a fantastic punt to clear\nour lines from the 22. She was\nso busy admiring the view\nthat she forgot to chase it.\nSadly, the Virgins were\nexhausted in the second\nhalf and much scrappier in\ndefence, enabling the classy\nBrunel players to clean up by\n55 points to nil.\nBy the final game, the\nVirgins were feeling the\neffects of playing without\nsubs, and although they put\nup a good battle against Wye,\nincluding an awesome lineout\nsteal from Felix, the game\nwas lost 45-0.\nHighlights of the day\nincluded Cherrypicker stepping up to take the drop-kicks\nand restarts, despite endless\nprotestations that she couldn\u2019t\ndo it (she could) and taking\nover the scrum-half job halfway through the day; Tumbles\nhaving a blinder in both attack\nand defence despite an early\ninjury; Thumper making her\nusual fearless tackles and\nremaining intact after a full\nspeed head-on collision with\nWonkey; Armitage making\noutstanding runs and tackles\nin her first game (and possibly backhanding someone,\nbut we won\u2019t mention that);\nFelix mauling away all day\nwhile berating the rest of the\nteam for standing and watching (guilty, moi?); and Wonkey\ncatching her own stud in the\nother bootlace and flooring\nherself, totally confusing the\nother team and herself in the\nprocess.\nIn the playoff matches,\nBrunel Firsts beat UCL to\ntake first place, and Wye beat\nBrunel Seconds to take third.\nDespite finishing 5th (and\nthere wasn\u2019t even a wooden\nspoon for us!), the Virgins\nhad an excellent day out and\nenjoyed (finally) playing some\nrugby again.\nOur \u2018supporters\u2019, who\nnever actually made it to the\ngames, were tracked down\nto Southside and forced to\nlisten to our tales of \u2018glory\u2019.\nFelix and Tumbles shared the\nplayer of the match award\n(although somehow neither\nof them drank it), Armitage\ndid her Virgin pint and the\nlovely Ben gave us nice neck\nmassages.\nRUGBY\nCurling Club created\nBy David Willey\nAt the end of last term a\nsuicidal leap into Union red\ntape was made by a couple\nof brave third year students \u2013\nthey went before the Athletics\nClubs Committee and proposed the creation of a new\nclub. With some sweet talking\nand support from some committee members, the idea of\na Curling Club was accepted.\nEven more importantly, some\nmoney was prised out of the\nACC\u2019s tight fists.\nWith the money secured, an\nevent was scheduled, emails\nwere sent out and on the day\neight potential curlers turned\nup. The Union minibus\nweaved its way nervously out\nof London and down the back\nlanes of Kent, using a combination of internet directions,\nAA roadmaps and scribbled\ninstructions on envelopes.\nOur venue was located on a\nfarm, so once we had driven\nthrough the yard, ignored the\ndogs and cows and avoided\nthe barn, we arrived at the\nshiny new Fenton Rink.\nOnce at the rink, we\nadorned the appropriate foot-wear, with one Teflon sole.\nThen we ventured out onto\nthe ice to discover how slippy\nthe \u2018Teflon versus ice\u2019 combination was. After an hour\nand a half of slipping, sliding\nand falling, we were all able\nto send the stones in roughly\nthe right direction and at\nroughly the right speed. One\nintrepid curler soon found\nout (to his detriment) that\nstanding up after releasing\nthe stone while still sliding is\na less than sensible idea.\nSo with the basics just about\nachieved, we decided to have\na match. A couple of exciting ends ensued with much\nshouting and vigorous brush-ing. There was a winning\nteam who were promised a\ndrink from the losing team,\nbut smiles were prevalent on\nthe faces of all participants.\nThe rink has now closed for\nthe summer but will reopen\nin October. Look out for our\nstand at next year\u2019s Freshers\nFair and come join the Curling\nClub.\nCURLING\nImperial College Union now has a Curling Club\n\n"

I\u2019m in Wilson House at the\nmoment, and like most freshers in\nhalls, pay the college \u00a330 a year for\nhigh speed Broadband connections.\nHowever, unlike most other halls,\nwe don\u2019t get high speed broadband\nconnections. We don\u2019t even get 56k\nconnections.\nThe hall has approximately 270\nresidents, but yet has only (from\nwhat I was told when complaining)\na 2 Megabit line. This, to me, is quite\nfrankly appaling. I\u2019m paying \u00a330 for\na high speed connection that I\u2019m\nnot getting, and in essence filling\nthe college with money they haven\u2019t\neven bothered providing a service\nfor.\nWhen I rang up to complain (I\nwas trying to get some notes online,\nbut it was estimated to take several\ndays) I was met with \u2018Well you only\npay \u00a330, it\u2019s still pretty good value.\u2019\nI don\u2019t pay \u00a330 for good value, I pay\n\u00a330 for a decent service at the quality and speed that people at other\nhalls get whilst paying the same!\nThey have refused to give me any\nrefund or compensation.\nThanks\nName and department supplied\nArthur Spirling, Head of ICT\nServices, responds:\nFirstly may I apologise on behalf\nof ICT, if it was a member of ICT\nwho gave you such an unacceptable reply. They should not have\nreplied in that way. They should\nhave given the positive news that\nthe new 100Mb line to Wilson House\nhas been laid and we are expecting\nto be able to make it a live service\nwithin the next two weeks. Since\nICT took over responsibility for the\nHalls service, from Damovo, we\nhave been working on improving it\nand specifically providing 100Mbs\nlinks to Clayponds, Pembridge\nand Wilson Halls in place of the\noriginal 2Mb links. Clayponds and\nPembridge are done. Wilson has\ntaken rather longer because we\nhave had to dig up roads for the\nfibre and getting council permission for such digging took some\ntime.\nListening about libraries\nDear Editor,\nHelen Dawson (Letters, Felix 2\nJune) comments that the informal\nmeeting held with the student reps\nrecently was \u2018an incredibly useful\ndiscussion\u2019. I would like to echo this\nview. The students who came to talk\nto us were constructive, positive,\narticulate, full of good ideas, and\nwilling to listen \u2013 and this is exactly\nthe kind of relationship we need, to\nhelp us develop and improve our\nlibrary services.\nWe already have regular termly\nmeetings with the Union President\nandtheDeputyPresident(Education\nand Welfare) but last week\u2019s meeting was so useful that we have now\nagreed that we will also hold termly\nmeetings with the student reps as\nwell, so we can get a richer picture\nof students\u2019 views, to supplement\nthe feedback we get in other ways.\nHelenalsoreferredtotheLibrary\u2019s\n10 year \u2018plan\u2019 and \u2018closure\u2019 of departmental libraries. At this stage it is\nprobably more accurately described\nas our 10 year vision, based on\nobserved trends, here at Imperial,\nand at other research-led universities both in the UK and elsewhere,\nand on the local context in which\nwe are operating. We all know how\nmuch pressure there is on space\non the SK campus, and this, coupled with the changing way in which\ninformation is delivered and used,\nand the students\u2019 need for longer\nlibrary opening hours, has been a\nmajor driver in decisions by some\ndepartments to ask us to integrate\ntheir departmental library into the\nCentral Library.\nOur professional view is that this\ntrend is likely to continue over the\nnext 5-10 years, and that it would\ntherefore be better for the issues\nto be acknowledged and openly dis-cussed, and for a more coherent\nlong-term strategy to be developed.\nThis would help to ensure that everyone had adequate lead times to\nplan such moves, that the students\u2019\ninterests were understood and\ntaken into account, and that there\nwere clear policies about things like\nappropriate provision of study space\n\u2013 both in departments and in the\nlibrary. I hope that the proposed new\nschedule of regular library meetings\nwith the student reps will help to\nprovide a forum for more discussion about these and other library-related issues.\nClare Jenkins\nDirector of Library Services\nImperial College London\nMore Wye worry\nDear Felix,\nWe in Wye eagerly awaited the\narrival of Felix last Friday, in the\nhope that your interview with the\nDeputy Rector might give some\nof the answers that College still\nseem unwilling to give us directly.\nHowever, what we found was the\nsame old excuses, with a few extra\nexamples of contradictory statements and College management\ngoing back on their word on different days and to different audiences howsoever suits their latest\npurpose.\nYou were right to draw attention to\ndiscrepancies between the guarantees made in the initial press releas-es, and the subsequent withdrawal\nboth of the 2005 intake in the affected courses and of earlier guarantees\nthat provision for current students\nwould not be affected (suggestions\nfor their course provision include\nbuying in block teaching, whereby\neach module is taught intensively\nover a couple of weeks and immediately followed by that examination,\nas well as now refusing to rule out\nthe possibility that some teaching\nwill not take place on our campus;\nneither option represents students\nbeing \u201ccompletely unaffected\u201d).\nIndeed, at the Deputy Rector\u2019s\nface-to-face event in Wye, a student\nhighlighted such inconsistencies, to\nput into context students\u2019 cynicism\ntowards the remaining promises.\nThe Deputy Rector was very quick\nto deny any \u201cbad faith\u201d, with his\nargument resting upon the premise\nthat the College never made such\ninitial guarantees and these were\na product of being \u201cmisquoted by\nthe student media\u201d (in fact the\nstatement was in Reporter and on\nSpectrum!); he thereby answered\nthe question of \u201cbad faith\u201d beyond\nall reasonable doubt, but not in the\nway he had intended.\nThat academic activity at Wye\nmakes a loss is undeniable, although\nas your article shows, 60% of the\ndeficit in Life Sciences is from non-Wye-based departments. The figures\nfor this deficit vary every time they\nare quoted, and have never been put\ninto the context of the Faculty-wide\npicture, longer-term trends, income\nfrom other activities on the campus\nor indeed the initial financial plan\nagreed at the time of the merger,\nwhich, rumour has it, gave Wye until\n2009 to break even.\nA statement in your interview\nwhich Wye students definitely still\ndo not buy is that they have been\nconsulted and informed to an acceptable extent. As evidence for this, the\nDeputy Rector cites monthly meetings with the Faculty and Campus\nUnion Presidents, which sounds like\na reasonable degree of communi-cation. However, the current Life\nSciences President has yet to visit\nWye, and the frequency of meetings\nwith the Wye President is exaggerated and neglects to mention that\nno such meetings took place until\nJanuary, more than five months\nafter the initial announcement of\ncourse closures. Furthermore, such\nmeetings have focussed entirely on\nchanges to the Faculty academic\nstructure, with a flat refusal to discuss options for the future of the\ncampus, presumably until such a\ntime as all such plans are finalised\nand beyond debate.\nHowever, the inconsistencies in\nthe College\u2019s statements that we,\nas students, find most worrying or\neven appalling are those relating\nto academic standards. At the time\nat which the closures were first\nannounced, various responses, both\npublic and private, suggested that\nacademic standards were a part of\nthe decision, referring to \u201cresearch\nratings\u201d (College Press release),\nand \u201cduplication\u201d of London-based\ncourses \u201cto a less rigorous standard\u201d (the Deputy Rector quoted in\nreports by the ICU President). When\nthe Deputy Rector visited Wye, he\nwas extremely emphatic in assuring\nstudents that academically speaking\nthey had as much right to their place\nat Imperial as the London-based\nstudents, and the course closures\nwere not a slight against them or\nthe academic rigour of their degree\nprogrammes, and this was certainly\nreassuring to those students.\nAnd yet now, when final year students are within three weeks of\ngraduating, academic standards are\nonce again called into question, at\na time when we have just worked\nour socks off through examinations\nand are about to attempt to use\nour degrees in seeking employment and further study. Perhaps the\ncomments refer only to research\nratings; perhaps any lower standards among undergraduates are\nreflected in lower numbers of higher degree classes being awarded\nrather than lower standards being\nrequired to gain those degrees; but\nthis is not clarified in the article, and\nwith such disparaging comments\npassed so freely whenever it suits\nCollege management to do so, we\nare left wondering whether the certificates we hope to gain in three\nweeks\u2019 time will be worth the paper\non which they are written, and are\nleft with little doubt that student\nwell-being is worth far less to the\npowers-that-be than the College\u2019s\nwider reputation.\nWhen Wye students pointed out\nthat national press carried stories\nabout the course closures before\nstudents had heard about them, the\nDeputy Rector was quick to dismiss the national media coverage\nas \u201crubbish\u201d. I shall interpret that\nas meaning that such media coverage quoted our honourable College\nmanagement to the letter.\nYours sincerely,\nA Wye student\nName and department supplied\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk.

Let\u2019s put all those hardworking economics students out of\ntheir misery and re-train them as\npop stars. Why bother having LSE\ntaking up all that prime space in\ncentral London when it could be put\nto better use as a recording studio?\nYes it sounds risky, but only a few\nplatinum albums later they will be\ninstantly granted the moral authority to lecture world leaders on how\nto solve global poverty. Admittedly\nI write this article in the spirit of\nnimbyism* as living only a few miles\nfrom Gleneagles (the location of the\nG8 summit) I am not overly enam-oured with the prospect of returning home at the end of term to find\nmy local area swamped by anticapitalist eco tree-huggers and the\nsecurity services required to control them.\nSaint Bob Geldof has encouraged\nthe world to descend upon the G8\nconference as the high point of the\ncampaign to Make Poverty History.\nWhilst no-one with even the slightest shred of humanity can disagree\nwith the sentiment of this noble\ncause, its methods are verging on\nthe ridiculous. Whatever happened\nto the stoicism of giving to a cause\nprivately? Now when we support\na charity we insist on getting a\nsweat-shop-produced rubber band\nso the whole world can see just what\nfantastic people we all are. We can\nonly help Africa if we remain a well-educated, prosperous country in a\nposition to help developing nations.\nPerhaps Mr Geldof could explain\nto us all how encouraging children\nto play truant from school helps to\nachieve this.\nBy jumping on the A-list band-wagon, we would not be solving\nany problems but subsidising them.\nUnconditional aid rewards woefully incompetent governments who\nspend far too much of it on themselves and not enough on the food\nand healthcare it was supposed\nto provide for the people it was\nintended for. Swiss bankers will be\ndoing a roaring trade in the weeks\nfollowing Sir Bob\u2019s little sing-song.\nWe have a duty to increase aid to\ndeveloping nations but at the same\ntime we also have the responsibility\nto ensure that not a single penny is\nmisused along the way.\nIncreasing aid and reducing corruption are necessary but not sufficient conditions for improving the\nlives of the millions who are living\nwell below the poverty line. If the\nBollinger Bolsheviks of the anticapitalist movement stopped deriding the multinationals, perhaps they\nwould realise that these large corporations could play a vital role in\nproviding support to governments\nwho are overwhelmed with the\ntasks facing them. Love them or\nloathe them, they all have ruthlessly efficient management structures and vast knowledge of the\nglobal economy. Sharing this expertise with a fledgling democracy\nwould greatly increase its chances\nof developing into a stable, prosperous nation.\nTo further maximise the chances\nof this happening, we could start\nwith the chastening of the European\nfarmers lobby. They seem to be the\nonly group left who have not accepted the Thatcherite consensus that\nunprofitable enterprises should\nnot be propped up using taxpayers\u2019\nmoney, as was recently demonstrated by the unfortunate demise of\nMG Rover. We now live in a country\nwhere farmers receive payments\nfor the \u201cstewardship of the countryside\u201d \u2013 they don\u2019t actually have\nto produce any food. Not only are\nthese people not letting third world\nproducers compete on equal terms,\nbut some are receiving money for\nbeing little more than glorified landscape gardeners. The benefit felt by\npoor foreign farmers through the\nelimination of rural welfare will far\noutweigh any suffering caused to\nour own native producers. Perhaps\nMr Geldof could sanctimoniously\ngrandstand on their behalf. I can\njust see it now \u2013 Land Aid: Support\nthe Shires\u2019 Need for Tweed.\nAlso ignore the mean minded dictum of the xenophobes who believe\nthat charity begins at home. Please\ncontinue to give generously to overseas funds, but do so for their cause\nand not your own. Altruism is not\na quality to be publicly flaunted, so\nplease take those silly little bands\noff your wrist. The world assumes\nyou to be a kind and generous person until you show otherwise. Don\u2019t\ninsult the intelligence of your peers\nby giving them the most crass of\nhints. There are far more effective ways of helping the third world\nthan massaging the egos of a few\nhas-been performers. Their celebrity and passion generates a huge\namount of welcome publicity, but\nit is very dangerous to assume\nthat a group of people who have\nspent their lives insulated from\nharsh reality have all the answers.\nIrresponsible pleas for bringing a\ncity to a standstill are not the best\nway of spending the moral capital\nthey have generated.\nFinally I request you to quietly\nturn down Sir Bob\u2019s invitation to\nEdinburgh in early July. Try later\non, when the festival is taking place.\nIt is a beautiful historic city with\na rich cultural heritage, with far\nmore rewarding activities on offer\nthan joining the malodorous masses kicking in the McDonalds on\nPrinces Street.\n[*NIMBY: Not In My Back Yard]\nMaking economics history?\nBob Geldof and the Make Poverty History campaign have the best of intentions but are\ngoing about it all the wrong way, argues Stephen McAloon\n\u201cUnconditional aid\nrewards incompetent\ngovernments who\nspend far too much of\nit on themselves\u201d\n\u201cAltruism is not a\nquality to be publicly\nflaunted, so please\ntake those silly little\nbands off your wrist\u201d\nAs the academic year draws inexorably to a close, anyone would be\nforgiven for throwing all thoughts\nof the next one to the wind, in grateful anticipation of the summer.\nHowever, it will probably interest\nsome to know that a most unusual\nand unprecedented event is planned\nfor the first week or so of October:\nthe first Imperial Environment Day.\nNow although it might be considered\ntoo great a challenge to fit the words\n\u2018Imperial\u2019 and \u2018environment\u2019 into the\nsame sentence, the day will mark at\nleast some effort and progress on\nthis front.\nSupposedly, by the time this\nevent occurs, the College will be\nbusy reducing its environmental impact and trying to become a\nleader amoungst the group of top\nuniversities that demonstrate sound\nenvironmental practise. (At present,\nof course, we have some way to\ngo.) The day will look to highlight\nthis shift and attempt to reinforce\nit, whilst being a huge joint venture between students, the College\nitself and certain others, such as\nCarbon Sense. It will bring together\nthe numerous and diverse, if somewhat decentralised, strands of green\nwithin the university.\nIf all goes to plan then whilst\nImperial academics show off their\nworld class environmental research\nand famous and respected alumni\nholdrelevanttalks,Imperialstudents\nand societies will provide support in\nthe form of music, artistic ventures,\nalternative sports parties, games\nand stalls. As we all know, there are\na lot of incredible people at this uni-versity, staff and students alike, and\nit isn\u2019t all that often that they have\nthe opportunity to come together in\nthis way and create something spec-tacular. It would seem that this day\noffers just such an opportunity.\nIf, by October, the College has not\ndelivered on its promises (environ-mentally speaking), the potentially\nmonumental day could, alternative-ly, serve as a sharp reminder of the\nrelevance and importance of these\nissues. The more cynical might suggest that such a big event could\nalso offer the college a smokescreen\nwith which to hide its true level of\ncommitment to the environment, if\nindeed there is anything to hide. We\ncan only hope that no one within the\ncollege would resort to such behav-iour, and we expect this event to be\nonly part of a larger general movement and continued visible change.\nSo enjoy the summer, whether you\nare on holiday or not. But at the\nsame time, look forward to next year\nand what is to come, and look forward to the Environment Day! Any\nindividuals, groups or societies wanting to know more or get involved at\nall should contact joseph.bull@ic.\nac.uk, hannah.theodorou@ic.ac.uk\nor samantha.perera@ic.ac.uk.\nTurning the College green\nJoseph Bull offers you an invitation to the first Imperial Environment Day\n\u201cThe event will bring\ntogether the numerous\nand diverse strands\nof green within the\nuniversity\u201d\nGreen technologies, like this solar-powered speed monitoring device, could be signs of a new commitment\nto the environment at Imperial College\n\n"
