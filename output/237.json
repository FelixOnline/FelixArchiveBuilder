In this work he expounded that progress was an ideal society\ngoverned by wise and educated\npeople. In this Utopia, in which everyone has\" cultivated wisdom\" and can only do good, the only extra condition required by the leaders was\nto spend a week alone in the wilder ness to gain spiritual refreshment.\nEven now it is apparent that this\nUtopia is unworkable \u2014 to have no realisation of evil is clearly impossible when Utopian man has access to knowledge of the past. And it ap pears that the elected leaders could not just be ordinary men, even if super-refreshed, as by studying the life of past dictators the temptation to allow the Utopia to degenerate into a dictatorship would be overpowering.

Yu\nCriticism\nThe Art of Science Exhibition which closed on Friday, must have\nbeen somewhat disappointing to the organisers. The number of exhibits\nand the quality of many of them indicated that IC is too insular.\nThe exhibits fell into two main categories : the purely technical and those\nwhich, to some degree, encompassed\nart and science. Mr. Corby n's Fourier analyse r was a mechanical process, Mr. Haskell s Shoe Shine device was merely a photocell, and in addition did not work; it indicated that a bare (female)\nfoot was shinier than a pair of reasonably polished black shoes. A hologram was exhibited by Professor\nGabor; this though interesting did not have any apparent artistic value.\nSeveral other exhibits fell into -this\nclass.\nIt is sad that this exhibition should produce such an unsatisfactory over-all impression. The theme of the Exhibition was excellent and if it is repeated, as we hope it will be, perhaps\nmore of the exhibitors will bear the theme in Jhind.\nS.R. Mallinson, D.M. Harris. Published by C.G.

    "content": "FELLX\nFolk Club The YoungTradition\nWe usually dread going to College\nFolk Clubs, but we have enjoyed\nplaying here and think that you are\neasily the best college Folk Club we\nhave visited, the overall standard of\nyour singers being very good.\" Thus said one member of the Folk group known as The Young Tradition,\nIC's Folk Club's guests for the\nevening. The group consisted of two\nmen and a girl who sang traditional\nBritish songs in a style similar to that\nof the Watersons, who were so popular last year when they appeared at\nIC Folk Club.\nThe White City Ramblers played\nsome rousing numbers to begin an; ve ning that was to consist almost entirely of British folk music. They were\nfollowed by two members of the\ngroup playing solo, namely Ivor\nGrayson Smith and then Me u rig Williams who showed the audience that\nWales still has its own language.\nAfter Me u rig came another well known resident, Steve Grant with two\nof his own compositions as well as\ntwo blues numbers.\nAfter one or two more songs from some of the other residents the audience was introduced^ to the evening's guests The Young Tradition. From then until the interval there was some\nexcellent singing in harmony of many traditional songs and also a single\nwhistle. Included among the songs\nwas a selection of sea shanties giving\nthe audience a good chance to display\ntheir vocal talents.\nAfter the break, the evening'.con-tin u ed with more songs from several\nof the residents including IvorJ in ab loo cf thirsty mood. The Young. Tr adit i ori 'then resumed for the remainder of the evening with a further selection\nof traditional songs in their style'that\nthey had learnt from the Copper Family, who live at Peacehaven in Sussex. It was just before the end that\nthey informed those present of; their\nhigh opinion of the club which was\ngreeted predictably with cheers and loud applause. At the end, for the\nsecond time in two meetings, there\nwere enthusiastic shouts for more which were acknowledged by one more\nsong, ending another enjoyable even-ing at the Folk Club. Today, IC Folk Club have as their\nguest Nigel Denver, a Scotsman with a good voice and sense of humour. Also note that the prices are a shilling\ncheaper and are now4 s. and 2s.T. J.OH WAY LIBERAL SOC\nPARTY\nWith the National membership of\nthe Union of Liberal Students increasing by 50 per cent this year, Malcolm MacCullum feels it is moving into a good period. In many cases the membership is up by 100 per cent as at\nI.C. Mr. Mac Callum believes that they\nshould use the present good climate within the organisation, co-ordinate\nthe various sections and try to achieve\nco-operation. Their co-ordinated\nefforts could then be directed outside\nthe party, particularly to running their\ncampaigns effectively. At the moment the increased membership had caused\nan increased amount of work in the\ncentral office at Liberal Party head, quarters. The office was expanding but depended at the moment on voluntary staff ; more permanent staff\nwill be forthcoming since the greater\nmembership brings more money.\nIN or OUT\ncont'd If, as it appears, the motion involves\na change in the constitution, it cannot\nbe regarded as passed, since any such\nchange must be posted four days before a vote is taken-7-the amendments\nwhich involve the constitutional\nchanges were not included in the\nnotice given. The changes are required to be passed at two further\nmeetings separated by at least a month. Otherwise the motion could be split\ninto two halves, the half embodying the principle of joining the N.U.S. only requiring to be passed once, and\nthe other half requiring rather more technical treatment. It seems odd however, that such an important issue\nmerits less consideration than the\nmachinery to implement it.\nKing's College last week held a referendum on the motion \" Do you\nwish yourself and King's College to\nremain in the National Union of\nStudents of England Wales & Northern Ireland.\"\nFor:380. Against: 99,\nHALDANE MUSIC\nLIBRARY THE HALDANE MUSIC LIBRARY IS NOW OPEN, with several hundred\nnew records available for loan to any\nmember of the College. All the\nrecords, so far, are mon phonic and\nof classical music, but it is hoped in\nfuture to buy records of both jazz\nand folk music, and eventually some\nstereo records. The new library has\nbeen made possible by a generous\ngrant from the Governing Body for\nequipment and records, and by their\nagreeing to the employment of a full-time music librarian.\nAll the services of the library will be free, the old deposit and hire\ncharge system having been abolished.\nThere will now be, however, much stricter checks on the conditions of\nrecords and fines will be levied whe never fresh damage is found on a record returned from loan. So as\nto reduce possible damage to a minimum, reproducing equipment will have to conform to a certain standard,\nbefore records are loaned. These re-st ric. ions are very similar to those\nimposed by public libraries and are to\nthe advantage of the borrowers.\nAll the books and periodicals on\nmusic have now been moved to the\nmusic library and a collection of\nscores is being started so that eventually it is hoped to have a score cor responding to every record. The library can be reached through the\nHaldane Library and is open at the\nsame times. Miss Halliday, the librarian, will be available there at most\ntimes to answer any queries.\nD. W.P enfold The IC Liberal Society were holding a sherry party at which Mr. Mac Callum was interviewed. He is at\npresent taking a Postgraduate course\nat Cambridge after graduation in mathematics this year.\nThe UL S differs from the Young Conservatives and Young Socialists in that it is highly independent of the\nParty. It is a recognised unit of the\nparty but the students run it them selves and have never been dominated by party officials. Mr. Mac Cull um said that this was probably the exp la nation of the increase in member ship since the other student political bodies were either limited by the need\nto stick to decisions made at their\nconferences or they were apparently\nfree but were prevented from doing anything by the need for approval from the party. He found that the\nUL S was now attracting students who would otherwise have joined C. N.D. or some other non party organisation.\nThe UL S was at present working on an industrial campaign, in London the\nwork was concentrated in Campden Town. They are also planning a campaign for next term on the problem of Southern Africa including Rhodesia and South Africa and an other campaign will deal with the\nhousing problem. They were considering proposing their own candidates for certain bye-elections in which case they would receive money from the party for promotion. This would only be done where no Liberal candidate would otherwise be standing.\nS. S. BAGGAGE In a recent interview Mr. Seaford,\nthe Domestic Bursar, declined to make any comment on the position of students whose luggage was rifled in Southside over the vac, as the matter\nwas still sub jud ice. He did however\npoint out that no liability was accepted for loss or damage to students'\nluggage and that the students con;cerned had several times been re quested to remove their luggage.\nDavid P. Sullivan graduating\nin the summer...?\nbean airline pilot \u2014\njoin the flying elite where your degree\ncould be of\nimmediate value to you\nThe BOAC/BEA Joint Pilot Training Scheme offers\ngraduates a special course of sponsored training for\na career as an airline pilot. The thirteen month initial\ntraining course includes at least 225 hours flying on\nsingle and twin engined aircraft, in addition to many\nhours on flight procedure trainers and simulators.\nYou would also receive extensive instruction in the\nmany subjects associated with flying - navigation,\ncommunications, aerodynamics, propulsion units,\nelectrics and electronics, radar . . . in fact the whole\nrange of aero-sciences.\nAs a graduate, your initial training would take place\nat the Oxford -School of Air Training, Oxford Airport,\nKidlington, one of the Board of Trade (Civil Aviation)\napproved training schools under contract to the\nBOAC/BEA Joint Pilot Training Scheme. When at the\nend of the course you are the holder of a, Commercial\nPilot's Licence and Instrument Rating you would be\noffered a Pilot's Contract with BOAC or BEA, You\nwould then be on th s threshold of an elite profession;\ntough, exacting, but infinitely rewarding. The salary\nof a senior captain rises to well over \u00a35,000 a year, and\nto his ample financial reward is added the immense\nsatisfaction of commanding the most up-to-date\nairliners in service.\nAn application form submitted now would enable you\nto attend our selection process during the coming\nmonths, and if successful you could be commencing\nyour training next Autumn.

As such the first two of\nthis term were successes. The relaxed atmosphere was prevalent and the audience\nwas prepared to listen. This last point is important to the Polk Club as they\nare not background music. In later weeks the attendance by the Polk Club fell off because they could not get the attention from the audience that they merited.\nThe last two weeks have made it clear that the sessions could not go on in their present form, because of the well-known group that began forming around the\nBar, and who seemed to show little interest in the proceedings, except when they\ncould comment on some particular person's performance.\nIt was not intended to ponder to their tastes which became apparent on\nSunday with a rendering of a well-known Rugby-song by a life-member of the Union\nafter the evening closed, so it has been decided, va th regret, to close the\nsessions for the rest of this term,\nPete Boldon\nChairman of Ents.\nSocialist Society and Student Politicians Alan Richardson, the Chairman of the National Association of Labour\nStudents' Organisations, spoke \u00bbo the Socialist Society on November 12f about\nthe Student Left. lie discussed first the role of the Socialist Society inside a University, a role which he described as being not only concerned with national issues but also with the more mundane sides of student life, including such things as staff student relationships, student freedom, curricula and the\nlike. Pie continued with some remarks on the Radical Student Alliance of which he\nis one of the founder members together with other liberal minded thinkers. The\naim of the RSA he said was to push the NUS executive into implementing the\ndecisions made at council.

    "content": "FELIX9 THE RUNNING, JUMP I HC, AND... SATURDAY THE29 th of October saw the first of the inter-col legia it e winter competitions at Motspur Park. These are run on a league basis, with each college competing against another (I.C.'s opponents were Guy's Hospital), so placings in an event are un imp or tant, providing the opposition's representative is beaten. Of course\neveryone attempts to do his best\u2014the U.L. captain and his talent\nscouts are always on the lookout for potential team members\u2014\nso individual results were good.\nOnly seven members of the club turned out, with but one fresher, of the\nmany who joined on Fresher's day. Even allowing for those whose cross\ncountry commitments had first priority, this was rather poor\u2014though other\nteams were correspondingly small. However, the team acquitted itself with\nsome promising results. Fresher Richard Beck\u2014another addition to the small\nbut strong Mines team\u2014came second in the 220 yd s. race and later coasted to\na win in the 440 yd s. in a time of 51.4 sees. The non-running U.L. quarter-mile champion being visibly perturbed by this. I.C. won all three jumps\nthrough Derek Wade in the long jump, a returned to form Chris Power in the\nlong jump, and Mike Evans in the high jump. Mike, now incidentally\nNorthumberland and Durham champion, conquered the opposition in his\ndazzling purple U.L. vest and claimed victory with a jump of 5 ft. 10 in. \u2014\nhe looks a likely successor to Leon Hall as U.L. champion.\nGenerally speaking the performance of the established \" stars\" was?\ncreditable, but a better turnout of Freshers is required\u2014throwers are in great\nneed. Excuses of un fitness are unacceptable as training sessions are arranged\neach Sunday and Wednesday, at Hurlingham, and Friday lunchtimes in the\ngym. The U.L. championships are in the first week of the summer term and\nSports Day isn't long after, so winter training is an essential preparation for\nthese events.\nI.R. Winship\nFIRST ELEVEN TOP LEAGUE\nI.C1, Battersea 0\nUNDER \"NEAR-IDEAL playing conditions I.C. made heavy\nweather of beating a quite useful Battersea team. The pattern of the\nplay soOn emerged with I.C. doing most of the attacking and the opposition relying on the quick breakaway\u2014these being quite easily dealt\nwith by a strong I.C. defence. However, Battersea did break clear\nonce\u2014only terrible finishing prevented them from scoring. After this\nthey created few chances, whilst I.C. were doing a lot better. Unfortunately, attack after attack was wasted th rou fh poor finishing.\nMidway through the second half it seemed that Battersea were quite\ncontent to play for a draw. At times they were reduced to panic measures\nto keep the I.C. forwards at bay. Sometime they had to crack and, with\nabout twenty minutes to go, Eastell scored with a well placed shot which the\ngoalkeeper touched but couldn't stop. During the game I.C. played some\nglorious football, but were let down by their finishing. By virtue of this win,\nI.C. are now too of their league.\nGuilds lead Mines in the Lowry race.\nPhoto by A. Gawronski.\nTHIRD) WIN I0 AFTER BEATING U.C.I Ion Wed., 9 th Nov., the thirds are now in the embarrassing position of being\nwell placed in the league, but having a somewhat misleading, yet chronic, goal average of7 for and14 against.\nThis follows the shock result against\nQ.M. C. II two weeks ago, when the thirds were completely crushed 13-0.\nThis days has now been forgotten,\nhowever, and so this Wednesday I.C. kicked off, and took an early lead \u2014\nEb butt scoring after 6 minutes. The college defence was very solid, with centre half Dolphin particularly dominant. Thus U.C. were rather in effective and play was chiefly con fined to their half. At times I.C. attacked strongly and only the brilliance of the opponents' goalkeeper\nkept the score down. With the beginning of the second\nhalf, I.C.'s play became slack and U.C. began to take the upper hand. However, the defence held and Hayes, in goal, had little to do. After some\nminor fluctuations the game ended\nwith I.C. the worthy victors.\nT.

As far\nas prestige is concerned the races\nare much more important than\nthe organised(?) warfare. This\nsituation is rather a sad reflection\non the prevailing state of affairs\nat college. Nevertheless the races\nDO take places.\nThe conditions for this year's races\nwere good, if slightly chilly \u2014 with a strong tide and a following wind. The Lowry crews raced first, pro duc ing a close race to the halfway mark, where Mines caught a crab, leaving\nGuilds with a two length lead. However, Mines managed to regain con tact with R.C.S. When the Morphy crews eventually started, Guilds took\na slight lead, but moved out of the\nbur rent at Fulham Way.

I refer to the subtle, vicious and unwarranted attack on Dr. Walter Adams, which appeared under the formerly respected and responsible\npseudonym of\" Col cut t.\" Col cut t calls Dr. Adams\" the very apotheosis\nof a racialist \" \u2014 though admitting that\nhe is a true champion of academic\nfreedom. I protest that Dr. Adams is no racialist, and that his actions\nthrough the whole of his public life do not warrant the attachment to him of the description \" the culmination or highest development of\" a racialist\n(apotheosis according to Webster,\n1961), and challenge Col cut t to adduce\nany evidence supporting his claim. It is a thing of great discredit to Imperial College that comment on the\naffairs of another college should be\nso calum nio us, particularly in a supposedly responsible publication which is distributed to most Universities and Colleges in the United Kingdom. John Grout another view\nSir,\nIt is unfortunate that Col cut t could not display a more sober control of\nhis emotional dislike ( Felix,2 Nov.) of the \" long haired, weir die trouble-makers of LSE Union.\" He, like many others with paternal is t attitudes to wards student protest, fails to recognise the fundamental point that it is\nquite natural for the LSE students to feel concerned over the appointment of Dr. Adams as their Director \u2014 particularly in view of the allegations\nmade against him in the two reports\nin question. The resolution passed\nat the LSE union is only an expression of this genuine concern and the\nfact that 425 students supported the\nresolution to only 10 against shows\nhow widely this concern is spread.\nOn another point we are told that\nbecause the Union has no part to play in the appointment of the Dire ctor it should keep its mouth shut. Ap plying this to life at large it implies\nthat one who has no power in a decision making should have no right\nto express an opinion either. Well, well! Finally it is true that Dr. Adams did an admirable job as the secretary\nto the Academic Assistance Council to help academic victims of NaziGermany in the thirties but does thai\nmean that all his subsequent actions\nshould be beyond question\" After\nall, Oswald Mosley was one lime a Socialist!\nFrancis G koh. and\nRhodesia\nSir,\nAs a result of your\" Support Rhodesia\" advert, Felix was accused in a letter to the Editor entitled \" THAT AD!\" of being \" an outlet to racist\nand near-fac is t propaganda.\" Your only reply to this extravagant\ndenunciation, was the rather weak\nstatement that \" The Editor does not\nnecessarily agree with the opinions expressed by advertisers etc. etc. \" a fact which anyone with the slightest\nknowledge of journalism should have\nknown. However, be that as it may, I did feel that the entire letter stank of the\nvery intolerance, which is the root\ncause of Africa' s troubles today; and\nI would just like, through the courtesy\nof your column, to point out to the\nwriter, Ashok Guru swamy, that there\nare in fact many people in the College who sym pathis e and even, dare\nI say it\" Support Rhodesia\" in her\npresent crisis, none of whom to my knowledge, wear jackboots.\nJ.G. Fleming\nIndifference?\nSir, Your editorial in the last issue of Felix regretted the smallness of the\nnumber of students present at the\nMemorial Service for the late Rector.\nIf this was due, as you imply, to in difference to the memory of this great\nman, it would indeed be deplorable. 1\nthink however that there was another\nreason for many people staying away.\nIn an age when only a small prop or tion of college members would claim themselves as Christians, it is surely\nanachronistic for the College's public\nact of mourning to take the form of a service in a Christian church conducted by a Christian minister. To expect people who are not Christians to join in this is to expect them to\nperform a dishonest act and to submit\nthemselves to considerable embarrass-ment.\nIn case it be thought that the\nChristians in the College wanted this\nservice, may I express my feeling,\nwhich1 know is shared by many other\nChristians, that this kind of establishment religion is a thing of the past,\nand in any case never had much to do with the Christian faith. May I also point out that the service was was arranged by the College author i ties independently of the Church in the College and its appointed chap-la in s. It would have been better by far for a purely secular act of remembrance\nto have been held by the College, in which Christians and non Christians could have happily taken part. We Christians would then have been free\nto offer thanks to God for the life of the Rector, and to pray for him and\nhis widow and family, in our own churches and in our own way.\nD. G. Finch a mEd: For a Christianman1 can see\nno alternative to a Christian service.\nI cannot see that a non-secular memorial service has any significance.\nPolitical Advertising\nSir,\nThe advertisements on Rhodesia and Vietnam prompt us to make the\nfollowing comments.\nIf the Editor of Felix is allowed to accept this type of advertising, then\nhe is causing the College Newspaper to become a political mouthpiece. In our opinion this is not the function of a College Newspaper. A person or group of persons with strongly opposing views, who wish to express their political disagreement, are forced to put a similar adv irt is e ment, citing their views, in a subsequent issue. Hence this can only develop into\na rather boring slang ing match as far as the general readers are concerned,\nsince all the arguments put forth, stated or implied, will undoubtedly be second-hand and well known to a majority of the readers through the national press.\nWe hope this advertising practice will cease.\nMike Edwards\nChris Eriksson\nOu is Parker\nPhil Marshall\nChris Molain\nMike Wilson\nlane E. Pearson\nJerry Stockbridge\nRay Phillips\nPeter ML Roberts\nRCS Union Meeting\nSir,\nI think it is a great pity that ICU is, as it seems to be, continually prevented from joining NUS by internal\npolitical rivalry. I applaud the efforts of some members of R CSU in their attempt to join NUS. This motion was well amended by S.E. Barnes\nto ensure that RCS representatives on NUS would be democratically elected\nfrom the Union and not nominated by the general committee. This will involve a change of constitution which I hope will be brought through the\nnecessary machinery eventually enabling RCS to take a full and active\npart in NUS from1967 onwards.\nR.E. Mack man Sir, Although some people may consider that Morphy Day and the S mo king Concert are amongst the most important aspects of Union life, Iam of\nthe opinion that the executive of\nR CSU should know better. The fact\nthat a motion as important as R CSU joining NUS should only appear on the Agenda Notices a few days be fore the meeting, whereas the above-mentioned \" sports \" received large-scale publicity for two or three weeks,\nappears to me to be either a de liberate attempt to \" slip it through quickly,\" or an unwarranted mis management of Union affairs. In both instances, this is a deplorable\nsituation.\nI feel certain that such an imp or tant motion could have been debated\nat a later Union meeting, by which time comprehensive speeches, both for and against the motion, could have\nbeen prepared.\nM.J. Lack TheHon. Sec.\nreplies\nSir,\nI would like to reply to the charges\nmade by Mr. Lack in his letter to this\nedition of FELIX. TheN. U.S. motion was handed to\nMr. Cavanagh on the evening of Thursday,3 rd November, and I did not receive it until Friday,4 th. It was\ntherefore not possible to post publicity\ntwo or three weeks before the Union General Meeting. The motion being received, it was not possible within the powers of the\nOfficers of the Union to defer it to a later Union meeting.\nI resent most deeply the libellous\nattacks on the integrity and competence of the Officers of the Union, and\nhope that in the future Mr. Lack, and others of his ilk, will have the sense\nand responsibility to check the facts\nbefore levelling such serious allegations. Jcffery J. Warren,\nHon. S ec,R. C.S.U. Sir,\nWith reference to the R CSU meeting of Tuesday 8 November, we wish to complain about the manner in which the \" Limerick Competition was promoted. It is our opinion that,\nalthough the limericks recited would have been in order at the \" Smoking Concert\" they were unsuitable for a general union meeting at which many members of I CW A were present.\nIf I CW A members are to be encouraged to take par f)in union activities\nwe feel that this sort of behaviour should cease.\nMaria Antonia Wallis\nPamela Horrocks\nGuys Again\nSir, In the last issue of Felix the editor\npublished an apology to Mr. Jim Murray for references made to him in the previous editions. In view of\nthe fact that I wrote the original report on the Freshers Hop it seems\nstrange, to say the least, that I was not consulted at all on the publication of the apology. There was probably nobody more surprised than myself\nwhen J read it in Felix. As the Felix editorial board do not seem interested in whether my information is accurate or not, I will for the benefit of those who are interested\nreveal where it came from. After the\nHop I interviewed \" Some Other\nGuys\" and on discovering that they\nhad no agent and had travelled down from Newcastle for the day I naturally\nasked how they came to be appearing\nat IC.\" My brother was Chairman of your Entertainments Committee last year \" was the answer I received\nfrom one of the group. \" Jim Murray?\"I asked, \" Yes\" he replied. I also had the information confirmed by a member of Ents Committee, who for obvious reasons wishes to remain\nanonymous. In his apology the Editor also said:\n\" It was also stated in several places\nthat Mr. Murray had failed his final\nexams.\" Anyone who care to read\nthroughout the original article will see that in fact it was stated nowhere\nthat Mr. Murray had failed his final\nexams. The Editor, in spite of his obvious anxiety to apologise for some-thing, might at least have read the\narticle for which he was a polo gi sing. In view of these facts the only conclusion seems to be that our\" controversial and independent fortnightly newspaper \" has allowed itself to be\nbullied into a retraction of the facts \u2014\na very lamentable occurrence.\nD.P. Sullivan\nE d:Iam pleased that Mr.S ulli v an\nhas been willing to restate his information personally. The article in the\nlast is ue stated that Mr. Murray em-,\npha tic ally denied the facts represented\nhere. If Mr. Sullivan will read the\nwhole of the first two issues he will find, j jn several places other than in his own article, that it was stated\nthat Mr. Murray had failed his exam i nations.\n\n"

CHA6081CO L CUT T TheN. U.S. debate together with the \" President by Popular Vote \" move-ment, are the two hardy annuals of Union Meetings. The fact that they are\nboth such frequently recurring themes and lead to more heated discussion\nthan most other topics, would lead one to expect a high standard of debate.\nThe debates are, in fact, usually very disappointing. Ample notice of such\n..lotions is given by the proposer s and the Union, but, apart from the\nproposer s themselves, nobody seems to bother to work out their own arguments,\neither for or against, until the debate itself. As a result, the last R. CJS.\ndebate on the N.U.S. was a shambles. No more can be said about it, except\nthat Pete Finch was rather brighter than usual in adding the \" provided finance\ncan be obtained \" clause, knowing full well that this must come from Council,\nwhich is not really likely to be swayed by the arguments put forward last\nweek. A similar situation arose at the I.C. Union Meeting two weeks ago\nwhen the motion to establish contact with North and South Vietnamese students\nwas debated. The motion was carried largely because the House was impressed\nby Malcolm Duckett's obvious sincerity of purpose, and because all other\nspeeches from the floor were of an extremely low standard. Please, all you\nbudding orators, give the motion a little thought in future before jumping to\nyour feet and trying to impress the Union. Remember, not many people\nhave impressed so far.\nCouncillors All? The same accusations of lack of preparation may be levelled at several\nmembers of Council, which also had its first meeting of the year two weeks ago.\nFor those who are not aware of the fact, and they seem to be legion, Council\nis that august body of elders who are responsible for the management of\nUnion affairs, particularly finance. Dr. Ken Weale, the Hon. Senior Treasurer,\nhad as usual prepared detailed estimates of income and expenditure for this\nyear, and had also written two foolscap pages of explanation. These na a been issued to Council members some days prior to the meeting, but it was\nobvious from the discussion that followed that few had bothered to read\nthem\u2014certainly not in detail, anyway. Pete Finch spent sometime questioning\nvarious aspects of the estimates which he did not thoroughly understand perhaps because he hadn't bothered to read the brief\u2014until the Duke lost his\ntemper and shut him up. But how many of those who sage ly accepted the\nestimates and tut. tutte d at Finch had really studied them themselves? On the\nwhole, though, the meeting was conducted well and showed a fairly responsible\nattitude from those present. The President showed the same somewhat\nnervous self-confidence that was evident at the Union General Meeting\u2014a change from Fletcher's assertive steam-roller ing chair technique. One does at\nleast have the impression that others are helping to run the Union and formulate policy this year. Duke shows promise\u2014when Frank Fuchs proposed\nthe installation of a Juke-Box in the Southside Bar and was about to expound\nat great length on the economies and aesthetic charms of such a device, the\nPresident accurately assessed the feeling of the meeting and ruled further\ndiscussion unnecessary, to the relief of all but one.\nLast year's Carnival was the centre of much controversy and unpleasant-ness, and as a result could hardly be described as a great success. With the\nrevamped Carnival organisation, much of the work has been given to the\nConstituent Colleges and a competent committee is running the show. We\nshould see a major improvement this year, but everyone in the Union should\nbe thinking about his contribution now, instead of waiting till next summer, if\nCarnival is going to realise its full potential.\nis for.\nThe Editor has presented me with a dictionary and made me write a hundred times \" I must not use big words if I don't know what they mean,\"\nyou will be glad to hear.\nCorrection\nIn the VIETNAM advertisement in the iast issue the name of Dr. S.J. Gold sack was omitted due to what\nis known as a\" clerical error.\" His doctorate was conferred on Mr. J. S.R. Good lad who is reported to have\nsaid that perhaps if he had paid more\nthen he might have received a professorship THE EDITOR does not necessarily\nagree with the opinions expressed by\nadvertisers, columnists or corre sp on dents;\nAS IN THE PAST the Editor will be\npleased to receive letters for publica-tion. However, the right to with old from such letters, either in part or\nIn toto, is reserved.\nTHE EDITOR REGRETS that, due\nto lack of space, several letters and\narticles have not been included. It is\nhoped to publish them in succeeding\nissues.\nDemocracy and all that\nIn the past two weeks we have seen two Union meetings, each one has been\nattended by some feelings of discontent amongst certain members of the\nUnions concerned. At the IC U ui on meeting last Thursday there were (two)\nmotions proposed from the floor voicing discontent of the way it was planned\nto run the choosing of the Carnival charity. There have been many protests\nabout the RCS Union meeting at which the NUS motion was debated.\nIn answer to the question of calling another meeting to give sufficient time for discussion, Union Honorary Secretary Bren doi j Parker replied that this\nwould have been considered if he had been questioned sufficiently early,\nthe letter protesting against the dec is ion to allow no discussion was not\nwritten until the previous Monday. While I do not consider that this has\nset a serious precedent in view of the\nabove statement, 1 feel that it should have occured to the executive that discussion would be demanded and p revision should have been made for this.\nIt is important that they should giv\u00ab\nthe impression that the Union can be\nrun democratically even if this is not\npossible to the extent of allowing uncontrolled discussion. With a limited time in which to cover a certain\nagenda the Union meeting must be\nRun; Adrian Fletcher could do this,\nso can Tony Duke, thought he has\nrather less skill than Fletcher; to answer a call for a quorum with an offhand affirmative betrays the urge to\nget through the agenda by hook or by\ncrook. Of course this could have\nbeen avoided if there had been more time.\nRCS Union failed in a different\nway, though perhaps with the same\nintention. Article25 of the R CSU constitution states \" Seven full days\nnotice of every General Meeting shall\nbe given on all departmental notice\nboards.\" R CSU Honorary Secretary\nJ. Warren states that notices were\nposted in time \" though perhaps they\nneeded looking for.\" As far as can be ascertained this was not the fault\nof the Publicity Commit ee. What ever the truth, a large num bei of RCS students were not fully aware that the\nmeeting was called until Monday morning. For such an important issue surely the maximum amount of\npublicity well in advance is warranted. An R CSU official said he thought that\nthe opposition( to the NUS motion) was not organised very well. cate d in the constitution. Suppose\nthat this change is not carried? Will R CSU have joined NUS but failed to\nproduce representatives?\nAgain the impression is created thai all along there has been an urge to\naffiliate R CSU to NUS as quickly as\npossible \u2014 presumably in time for the\nMargate Conference this month. All amendments proposed which would have given the Union more time to\nthink were rejected or deferred.\nHowever the issue is still open. To join NUS, R CSU needs to get the\nmembership fee (soon to be 5s. per\ncapita) from Council as well as sufficient money to send up to seven de le these meetings of councils of three\ndays and one week (likely to be replaced by one Annual Conference),\nI estimate the cost as being of the\norder of \u00a3500 per annum. political ?\nConstitutional ?\nHowever the most debatable point to come out of this debate is the\nquestion of a constitutional change.\nKeith Cavanagh admits that the set-ting\" up of a Committee to represent\nR CSU at NUS involves such a change,\nbut that the motion debated merely\ncauses such a change to be proposed.\nThis will be du'y proposed as in di As you can see from a letter printed\nin this issue, there are moves afoot\nin this democratic institution to suppress the publication of political\nadvertisements. The Secretary of the\nFELIX Board, who also received a copy of this letter, considers that\n\" there is a strong feeling for the exclusion of Advertisements of a Political Nature from FELIX,\" although he\nhimself subscribed to the last one.\nPresumably the basis of this \" strong feeling \" is one letter signed by several\nmembers, albeit prominent members,\nof the Union. These advertisements\nwere not published without careful\nconsideration. I do not see why\nFELIX should not be a forum for\npolitical debate any more than re li go us or recreational debate, provided\nit remains independant and unbiased.\nI consider that the two political advertisements so far published represent the feelings of a significant\nnumber of people in the College.\nSince FELIX is expected to run almost\nsolely on advertising revenue I must\npoint out to these people that the\ntwo advertisements they deplore have\npaid for almost 24 per cent of the\npages so far published this term. In\nview of the fact that SCRUTINY was\nwound up only three weeks ago due\nto a lock of advertising, it would seem\nfoolhardy to reject any opportunity to\nincrease our revenue, provided that it\nis within the limits of the law and\ngood taste.\nINTERESTED IN: RALLYING RADAR RAILWAYS\nThen come to the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Princes Gardens\nfor a book about it.\nOpen117 pm. daily (11-5.30)\nMonday& Wednesday LAMLEY'S technical & general\nbooks\nart materials\ndrawing\ninstruments\nstationery\npaperbacks\n1.3 & 5.

    "content": "IN or OUT? RCS NUS debate By our Correspondent\nAt the last R. C.S.U. general meeting on Tuesday, 7th November,\nthe following motion was passed:\n\" The Royal College of Science Union instructs its General Committee to apply immediately for full membership of the National\nUnion of Students of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if the\nextra money can be made available and that a General Meeting\nshould elect an NUS Committee comprising of:\ni. An NUS Secreary who shall become an officer of the Union,\na member of the General Committee, and Chairman of the NUS\nCommittee, the Secretary to be elected from and by a General Meeting\nof the Union,\nii. Ex-officio the President of the Union,\nHi. Five members elected from and by a General Meeting of\nthe Union, the function of the Committee being to advise the General\nCommittee on matters concerning NUS and to be responsible for\nNUS services. The Committee shall elect delegates and observers on\nbehalf of RCSU to any NUS cone rence or committee on which RCSU\nwishes to be represented.\"\nIt seems doubtful whether this was constitutional. Its effect will\nbe to create a new officer, a new general committee member, and a new committee, which require amendments to the constitution\u2014\na similar situation occurred in May when Brian Compton's publicity\ncommittee had to be incorporated in the constitution, and am amendment therefore had to be passed.\nHie original motion.\n\" The Royal College of Science instructs its General Committee to apply\nimmediately for full membership of the National Union of Students of England,\nWales and Northern Ireland.\"\nmight not have created these difficulties since the general committee has\n\"the power to appoint representatives to any committee on which it is desirable\nto have the Union represented\" ( RJ G S.U. constitution, article 67). However,\nit was argued by Br. Barnes that a committee would be necessary to handle\nN. UJS. services, and would ensure that the representatives were democratically\nelected.\nBefore Mr. Barnes' amendment to the motion- was voted on, President\nCavanagh said that there had never been any intention1 of not democratic ally electing the delegates. The amendment was, however, passed.\nThe main debate was opened by Mr. Booth man who tabled the motion; the\ncase for joining N.U.S. was e luci dated by F. Fuchs, R.E. Mack man, Miss B. Hedge, and A. Lafferty, and Mr. Booth man summed up. The argument was that R. C.S.U. would not lose its autonomy, since N.U.S. is\na federation of colleges, individual colleges being free to pursue their\nown policies. Mr. Lafferty said that\nthe Union would not lose financially\nsince the County Councils were\nlegally compelled to pay the increase\nin the Union fees. This assurance did not prevent an amendment, proposed\nby Mr. Finch, being passed, that the\nUnion would not join unless an additional grant sould be obtained. Miss Hedge pointed out that although the\ncost of joining was 2/6 per head\n(rising to 5/-), the cost for individuals joining was 17/6 (rising to 2 gn s.) and this made it cheaper to join as a whole, even if only16 per cent of\nUnion members wished to join privately. The o pnc. st ti opened with a letter\nwritten by R.C. Lethbridge, who could not attend, and read by Tim Doe:\" I believe many other members of R. C.S.U. will be left with no alternative but to resign from R. C.S.U. if\nthis motion is carried... I would like to convey my regret that this\nunion should lower itself even further\nby considering any association with a cosmopolitan body such as N.U.S.A body that speaks without saying anything.\" Mr. Doe continued by saying that\nR. C.S.U. would gain nothing by\njoining N.U.S. and would lose much of its autonomy. Most of the con cessions which were available could be obtained from other sources or\nsimply with an ICU card. Regarding the finance, Mr.T a it said that it was\nnot right that other people should\npay for N.U.S. concessions, through\nincreased R. C.S.U. fees.\nMr. Fuchs summed up the case for\nmotion in his usual lucid style\ngiving further details of N.U.S. services.\ncontinued on p.2 the\nby\nBo runs to Brighton\nBOANERGES, Guild's veteran car mascot, successfully completed this year's Brighton Run, which was held on Sunday the 6th, the Seventieth Anniversary\nof the repeal of the Red Flag Act. This year's time was just under three\nhours, undoubtedly a tribute on Bo's part to the traditionally py jama clad Guilds men who turned out to give him arousing send-off from Hyde Park. The time is very nearly a record for the car, now sixty four years old and a real credit to the College and, especially, to the Guild's Motor Club, who, obviously, spare no effort to keep him in tip-top condition. Bo, as he is affectionately known to to meet him, enjoyed a very good\nall Guilds men, is one of the only two\nJarnes and Browne cars known to\nstill be in existence although nearly\ntwo hundred are thought to have been\nbuilt in the firm's ten year life-time at\nthe beginning of the century. Jim Andrews, of the Motor Club, has\nspent some time unearthing facts\nabout the car and is hoping to produce a pamphlet on the subject later\nin the year.\nMost of the Guilds men who went\ndown to Brighton, either with Bo or\nto meet him, lunch with Professor Ford. President\nof the Motor Club and Sponsor of\nBo for the run, and Mr. Proctor,\nowner of the other James and Brown, CONQUER ER, who also completed\nthe Run. Although Conquer er is two\nyears younger than Bo he had a lot\nmore trouble getting to Brighton and\ntook four and a half hours.\nA tribute then to Bo, the Guild's Motor Club and John Hann is for\nimproving Bo's position from97 in Hyde Park to 13 in Brighton. F.J. Morris R CSU meeting Chemistry Lecture Theatre A was\nagain crowded for the important\nNUS debate. After the minutes had\nbeen read and signed as correct, President Cavanagh proceeded to attack\ncertain articles which had appeared in\nFELIX. He claimed that sufficient notice\nhad been allowed for the Rent Tribunal Motion, and that any criticism\nshould have been made during the\ndebate and not in the letter page of\nFELIX. He also objected to an article\nby Tim Does in \" Late News.\" which had described the election of Queen of Jez as \" a primitive and barbaric\nspectacle.\" This was a traditional event, he said, and he was unable to\nalter it. \" Had Mr. Doe made his\ncriticisms at the time, the matter\ncould have been discussed.\"\nThe main NUS debate followed, and the amended motion was carried\nby 170 votes to 119. Later Frank Fuchs proposed that R CSU should encourage closer relations with Royal College of Art Union, and that discussions should be started about reciprocal agreements. This motion was\ncarried overwhelmingly \u2014 only half a dozen A CW arians voted against. As an interim agreement. R CSU members were to be allowed into RCA dances at reduced rates.\nRoger Lyons If an application were made to\nNUS before the 16th of November it would be notified at the coming Margate Conference and the college\nwould be able to send delegates. This was the reply given by Roger Lyons( treasurer of NUS) to a question put\nby Frank Fuchs. Mr. Fuchs asked\nbow a college could join NUS at a meeting he had organised on2 nd November. Although many members of R CSU known to be interested in NUS were\ninvited to the meeting, less than a dozen people turned up to 'hear the\ntalk on NUS. Mr. Lyons \u00a3ave a general introduction outlining NUS services, concessions and its- function as a national representative in governmental discussion. Following this\nintroduction, questions were put to\nMr. Lyons. To a question about political influence in NUS he said it was not possible for an NUS conference to discuss political motions due to its constitution. He admitted, however, that\npolitical groups did exist behind the\nscenes.\nOn NUS fees Mr. Lyons said that\nthe fee was due to increase shortly to\n5s.0d., however for colleges with financial difficulties special concessions\nwould be made.

The first\nwas fr or, John Hands, President of UL U, requesting permission to ad dress tii e Union; the second from the Senate was the annual warning to students about participation in November5 th celebrations. The third letter was from Messrs. Eb don and Flint and expressed concern at the\nCouncil decision not to allow discussion of the Carnival Charities. Tony Duke stated, in reply to this,\nthat Council were acting within their\nrights in taking this decision but a motion could be raised after the\nCouncil elections. This did not seem\nto satisfy some people however, and a motion was raised immediately to the effect that the Carnival Charities should be discussed immediately after\nthe financial report. A vote was taken on the motion and although it seemed\nto many of those present that the mo tion had been carried the official result was129 for and140 against.\nD r.K.E. We ale, the senior treasurer\nof the Union, then presented the fin an cia l report for last year. Although there was a deficit for last year of nearly \u00a32,500 this has to be considered\nin the light of the fact that over \u00a32,000\nwas spent on refurnishing the lower lounge of the Union.

( IC has been without a mascot now for two years, the last\none being a stuffed eagle called\nPhoenix). Mike was then carried in by the mascot bearers and placed at\nthe front of the Union. Dave McBain, Deputy President of the\nUnion, read out an apposite de di Mike only cost \u00a330 and that recently\nthere was an article in the \" New Scientist\" promising a barrel of beer\nfor the Union if Mike is not stolen\nwithin one year.\nElections Ballot sheets were handed out for the Council elections, there being only two vacant places. The candidates\nwere K. Guy, last year's chairman of S CC and this year's secretary of Ents Committee, D. Booth man, last year's captain of the University challenge\nteam and member of S CC,P. Neo gi, who stood for election as General Secretary of Union Calcutta University before coming to IC, and was\nchairman of the India Society last\nyear, J.O' Reilly, vice-president of Mines, D. Poul ter, chairman of Con Soc, and finally S. Barnes. The result\nof the election was: \u2014 K. Guy267, J.O' Reilly226, P. Neo gi163,D. Booth man125,S. Barnes 106, D. Poul ter103. Charity vote A motion was again introduced, after the Council elections,\nto have a discussion on the Carnival Charities. This was defeated by 158\nvotes to131 votes.\nThe result of the Charity vote was :\nMuscular Dystrophy 261, International Family Planning 97, Oxfar 95\nand ICS AF37. John Hands, President of UL U, then addressed the meeting and after\nissuing a few preliminary blandishments he urged members of IC, particularly fresher s, to take an active\npart in UL U and to take advantage of\nthe facilities provided at Male t St. He said that IC students could gain a great deal by meeting members of other Colleges, particularly arts stu-dents, through U LU.A motion was then introduced by\nMr. Duck ett saying that \" IC Union should establish contact with students\nin both parts of Vietnam.\" After a short debate the motion was carried\noverwhelmingly. RCA The meeting was informed that a number of students from the Royal College of Art was interested in getting together in pairs with students\nfrom IC and seeing what they could produce. After the laughter died down it was discovered that they had some form of kinetic art in mind. Apparently a small number of IC and RCA students are already co-operating\nto produce something and it is hoped\nthe idea will spread.\nMr. Finch, just before the close of the meeting, said that he had received\na letter from LSE asking if there\nwould be very much support for an LSE IC nursery for the use of married students.\nSuch a nursery has already been\nestablished at Manchester. Will any married students at IC who would support such a nursery please contact\nMr. Finch( via Union rack).\nThe meeting closed,at 2.38 p.m. D. Sullivan\nA DECISION to double the NUS\nsubscription fee for each student\nis likely to cause furious debate at\nthis year's Margate Conference.\nIt was at Margate two years\nago that the fee was raised from\n1/3 to 2/6. The latest proposal\nrepresents a300 per cent, rise in\ntwo years.\nA Birmingham NUS spokesman\nsaid, \" I don't think we will be getting value for our money when the\nfee goes up to 5s, particularly if they\ndon't divert money to regional head-quarters.\"\nTheN US electoral system is also\ncausing dissatisfaction. A report by the committee set up at the Easter\nconference is to recommend no change\nfrom the present system.\nThe recently-formed Radical Student Alliance has published a manifesto which attacks the NUS leadership as a\" self-perpetuating clique.\" It also criticises student organisations\nfor their \" lack of h nil it an cy and per-spec ti ve.\"NUS President-elect Ge of frey Martin \u2014 like his predecessor\nfrom Belfast University \u2014 said at\nSwansea recently that he would welcome militancy. Several colleges have already threatened to d is affiliate from NUS. At Bradford a committee has been set up to consider forming a breakaway\nmovement in the North. And Southampton intends to withdraw unless the\nvoting system is changed to a\" more equitable method\" by Easter 1967.\nVARIOUS PILL OR NURSERY WHILE Cambridge guards against the\nfuture with the opening of a birth\ncontrol clinic, the red brick universities\nare taking care of the consequences.\nManchester University Union has\nrecently established its own nursery in a' church hall \u2014 against the advice of the university authorities. It caters\nfor twenty babies of students at \u00a32 12s. per week which is cheaper than other\nlocal nurseries.\nA similar scheme for students is\nalso in an\" experimental stage\" at\nBirmingham \u2014 where it is hoped to extend this later. RED BRICK. ANOTHER RADIO PIRATE UNIVERSITY students are definitely\nto have their own\" pirate\" radio show. Radio Scotland has agreed to\ngive Strathclyde University a full Hour's broadcasting on Sundays.\nAccording to the show's student\nmusical director, the programme will resemble BBC's\" Roundabout.\" NONESUCH New Phoenix\nEditor Phoenix, as many people know, is\nICUn ion's official magazine.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nHELP STAMP OUT MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\" The disease is one of the most in-te resting, and at the same time one\nof the most sad of all those with\nwhich we have to deal : interesting\non account of its peculiar features\nand mysterious nature, sad on account of our powerlessness to influence its course.\nIt is a disease of early life and of\nearly growth. Manifesting itself\ncommonly at the transition from infancy to childhood, it develops with\nthe child's development, grows with\nhis growth\u2014so that every increase in\nstature is an increase in weakness and\neach year takes him a step further on\nthe road to a helpless infirmity, and in\nmost cases to an early and inevitable\ndeath.\"\nThis was how William Gower s described Muscular Dystrophy in1879 and until recently the position had not changed. However, in the past\nsix years, the Muscular Dystrophy group of Great Britain has supported research to the tune of a quarter of a million pounds. As a result,\ndoctors can now detect the carrier in women to an accuracy of 75 per cent,\nand further research should increase\nthis figure to over 90 per cent. A woman who is a carrier may infect\nhalf her sons with the disease and half her daughters will be carriers.\nOh vio us ly, systematic detection can\ngradually stamp it out\nit is the furtherance of this aim that\nis receiving the support of the Carnival Charity and a good financial result\nof our efforts will bring benefit directly and substantially to the Muscular Dystrophy suffer ara. \"Details of the group and the precise\nnature of the disease are to be found on the main notice board in the\nUnion. It is essential that Carnival raises a record amount this year, and with this aim in mind I ask for the\nsupport of every member of the\nUnion, and every member of staff.\nIF EVERYBODY COLLECTED ONLY ONE POUND, WE WOULD DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS RECORD. Various activities are planned for the whole session. Collecting tanks\nbridge\nFor the opening match of the sea-son, IC first team played LSE. The\nmatch resulted in a draw, a result\nwhich may have been as good as expected since both the ICp a rner ships were hitherto untried.\nGame All Dealer South\n\u2022 AJ37A J0AQ7632* A J At the table, where IC were sitting\nEast-West, the bidding was :\nES W N \u2014 \u2014 2 D \u2014\n2S \u2014 2 N.T. \u2014\n3 N.T. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nA sufferer from Muscular Dystrophy\nfor your^ n nie s will be placed at\nstrategic points. A football pool will be run and raffle tickets will be\navailable this year before Christmas. Other events are o eing discussed, and details will be announced in good time.\nHowever, despite all these activities\nmost money comes in from rags and street collections. In the weeks before Christmas, carol singing parties\ncan bring in \u00a3100 a night if enough people turn up. The three college\nVice-Presidents will be organising this\nsinging and some of the rags. 1\nwant other groups who have ideas to\nsee me and then go out and collect.\nIt is the public who have the money \u2014 ROB THEM IF NECESSARY! Remember the success of the Carnival lies with everyone of us. If you are willing to help, see or write to\none of the following: J.C. Stockbridge, 612 Ti zard, C. Palmer,435 Ti zard, or the three VicePresident s: J.O' Reilly, R. Conn and Phil Marshall. J.C. STOCKBRIDGE, Carnival Organiser.\nIC against LSE The LSE pair finished also in three\nNot rumps but this time East was de-clare r after bidding2 Not rumps in response to West's opening bid of 2\ndiamonds. It shows remarkable restraint on the part of both Wests in that the final contract stopped at\n3 Not rumps. Making this contract presents no difficulties. However the IC declare r made 10 tricks (2 in each of clubs,\ndiamonds and hearts, and4 in spades)\nby tackling the spade-suit whereas our opponents only made9 tricks by going for the longer odds of establishing the diamonds. However, on West's cards, if he gets\na positive reply from his partner he\nmust start thinking about the possibility of bidding aslam. The first difficulty which confronts\nWest is deciding what to open. The choice lies between 2 Diamonds( showing eight playing tricks with\ndiamonds as trumps) or two No trumps (20-22 high card points and a reasonably even distribution). I would favour a2 Not rump opening on the\nhand since it holds the controls in all four suits and the likely bidding sequence would then be :\nES W N \u2014 \u2014 2 N.T. \u2014\n3 C \u2014 3 D \u2014\n3S \u2014 4 D \u2014\n4S \u2014 5S \u2014\nEast's bid of 3 Clubs is asking his\npartner to bid his four card suits in\nascending order.\nOver5 Spades East may well bid 6\nSpades. Although this is not a good\ncontract it is one which can be made\ngood by good declare r play.\nThe probable lead from South will\nbe a small club, taken by the ace in\ndummy, since South will not have\nunder led the king of clubs against a slam contract. Declare r now has a certain club loser ,and the only ways\nin which he can avoid losing a spade\ntrick are if West holds K x spades or\nif East hold10,8 doublet on. So\ndeclare r will play J hearts and overtake with K,now finesse J diamonds\nand overtake with Qin dummy if\nEast does not cover with K. Trump a small diamond in hand and then\nfinesse J spades. When North plays\n6 spades it shows he could not have\nstarted with10,8 doublet on. So\nSAFETY Recently Mr. Harry Fairbrother,\nSecretary of the College branch of\nA.S c.W., told Felix that if the CoUege\nwere an industrial organisation with\nthe same number of people, the medical side would be far larger. The\nconditions of use of machinery would\nbe far more strict. He also claimed\nthat there is insufficient access to the\nCollege Health Centre and that there\nare not enough first aid cabin ents pro-vi ded. Mr. Fair brother said that he\nthought there should be a student\nrepresentative on the College Safety\nCommittee. The Technical Saff have\nan elected representative\u2014the chairman of the College branch of the\nA.S c.W. Why should there not be a student rep.? Mr. Fair brother seemed\nto think that there should be a representation of every group in the College, so that there should be no one\nwho did not have a say in the running of such an important body as the\nSafety Committee. Dr.E. Cohen, the chairman of the\ncommittee, said that he did not want the committee to be turned into a debating society to meet every six\nmonths to decide whether or not to\ngrant some group or other an extra\nration of safety. The function of the\ncommittee, he said, is to investigate\nhazards and reduce accidents.\nRemar k able Record Dr. Cohen had a list of every accident involving injury reported in the\nperiod April to September this year.\nThis list contained about a hundred accidents, all of the order of bruises,\nsprains . broken fingers with an occasional broken arm. Of the accidents\nreported, only about one or two\naffected a student ,and a similar num ber affected the Academic Staff. This\nis remarkable, even though the\nperiod includes the long vacation, and could be explained either by the\nfa<$t that the academic staff and students are far less accident prone, or\nthat staff or students don't want to\nreport their accidents. The Technical and Cleaning Staff would be more inclined to report accidents, as they then\nget sick benefit. Dr. Cohen said that\ndespite the fairly small number of reported accidents, the first aid boxes\nempty at a phenomenal rate.\nBoth Mr. Fair brother and Dr. Cohen were of the opinion that safety\nis an attitude of mind. The attitude\nof the College is illustrated by the\nattendance at the safety lecture the\nprevious week. This was publicised in FELIX beforehand and it was stated\nthat all staff, academic and technical,\nand all students would be welcome.\nIncluding the speaker, Dr, Buzzard, Dr. Cohen, who introduced him, and\ntwo FELIX reporters, the attendance of the lecture was fifty-three men and one woman. This out of a college of over 3,500 students alone.\nI. E.W. play A spades dropping Souths K, and trump another diamond. Draw North' s last trump and enter dummy with A hearts and play dummies two winning diamonds and concede the\nfinal club. This play illustrates a very useful\ntechnique for playing what at first\nsight appears to be an impossible con tract. I imagine a distribution of the\nopposition's cards such that the con tract could be made and then play the\nhand assuming that these are the\ncards the opposition hold. It is surprising how often bold play like this\npays off.\nIan Constable. "
