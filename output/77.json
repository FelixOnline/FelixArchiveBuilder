February, is the entry:\nWE LIKE MOONEY Good old Mooneyl\nKeep up the good work!\nKeep off the 1\nOn the opposite page, the diet loi an in-chief has written:\n\"Noted\".\nMr. Mooney was born in 1923, and he tells us that his\nearly life before 1939 was uneventful. He spent seven, years\nduring the war in the Merchant Navy, and saw most of the\nworld, but not as an adviser on ooo ker yi His life as a catering manager did not start on Joe's Stall in the Mile-End\nRoad; it started at the Selsdon Park Hotel in 1946. From that\ntime onwards, he stayed at the St. James Court Hotel, the\nGrand Hotel at Harrogate, and many others.\nIn 1952, Mr. Mooney came to I.C. as manager of the\nUnion Catering, and sino e that time he has taken over nearly\nthe whole of the catering of the College. When he was a a kad. what he liked, he replied \"Quieter Carnivals, and trifles--eaten, not used as missiles!\".\nAny profile of Mr. Mooney would be incomplete without\na reference to Mr. Kitchener.\n\"At a recent Dinner in the Upper Dining Hall,\" said Mr.\nMocmey,\" I put peppercorns in Kitchener's soup; but he found\nthem. I put cayenne pepper in the fish course; but he twigged\nit. But I got him at last - I put ginger in the cherries of\nthe fruit salad, and I cant tell you what he said to me.'\" Kitchener replied by asking Mooney to \" come out and\nhave a good dinner\".\nHOPS The entertainments committee are hold ij; hops in the\nAyrton Hall on the following Saturday even ii ga of the term:\nTomorrow 28th May 4th June & 11th June.\nIt will not be possible to hold one on June 18th as\nthe Hall has been booked for another function.\nTickets will be sold in the new Union on Friday lu noh times and on the door Saturday evenings.\nScores of fair \"maidens\" were turned away from the\nHop on 7th May last and doubtless they will not be very keen\nto oom e again. What is the o a use of this deplorable situ-ation? - YOU Y0 Ul\nAt 8.30 p.m. there were about 100 girls and 30 men, and\nthe numbers did not become even until some of the girls had\ndeparted to make way for the 10 per cent. boys.\nI.C. Hops were once the best in London and there is no\nreason why they should not again hold this distinction.\nGentlemen, it depends on Y0UI R.C.S. COUNTRY HOUSE BALL The second R.C.S. Formal Ball waa. held at Silwood\nlast week and is now an established event. The organisers defied superstition! \"by holding it on .Friday 13th, \"but\nwere unlucky only in the weather the evening being as wet\nas any since the last Silwood Ball*\nwe were all pleased to see the Rector and Mrs- Linstead there, and also Mr. and Mrs, Savage who had helped\nto make the dance a success*\nThere was dancing in the Hall until 6,00 a.m,, but\nmany preferred to sit out on the balcony and watch their\nfriends below.\nAt midnight everyone walked over to the refectory\nfor an excellent buffet set amidst delightful floral\ndecorations, Silwood has a reputation for its\nflowers and again the gardener proved himself a master\nof his craft.\nAs the night progressed most people explored the\nrooms around the hall and car drivers were doing a brisk\ntrade renting out back seats. As it became lighter, y many couples were seen strolling around the park apparently getting an appetite for breakfast before climbing into t ie coaches for the return journey.\nStudentship is a branch of that well-known, but little\nstudied, art, Undergraduateship, which is in itself an integral part of Lifemanship. The basic premises of Lifeman\nship are laid down in several excellent treatises on the subject by Potter, and the headquarters of the Lifeman movement\nare situated in Exeter. Being such a large field of study,\nmany of the smaller branches are handed over to research\nteams who send periodic reports of their work to the head-quarters. Such a report was read to the I.C. Lifeman Society on May 11th and is republished in an abridged form with\ntheir kind permission.\nSTUDENTSHIP: by Mr. Lentil\nI think, before I begin to talk about my researches into Studentship I should define the meanings of a few terms\nused in LIFEMANSHIP. To start with, Lifemanship is the art\nof being \"one-up\", of making the other fellow ft fela cad by\nlegitimate means. The Lifeman is, or always should be,\"one\nup\" on the other fellow by using Lifeman ploys (sometimes\ncalled gambits). The art of Lifemanship is the ability to\nknow when and how to use the o or rect ploy.\nStudentship generally takes two distinct forms; that\nof plo ying fellow students, and that of plo ying academic su-peri or s, such as lecturers. There is, of course, a danger\nin the latter, as the academician may be a Lifeman himself,\nbut this is a rare if not a good thing. Taking the first\ncase, I shall consider one or two well known ploys, and give\nexamples of them. .As is often the case, the Lifeman's main\nobject during his career is to be \"one-up** on his mentally\nsuperior colleague.\nThe BEE gambit, named after Mr. Edmund Bee is an example\nof this type of ploy. It is quite well known now, but loses\nnone of its efficacy for all that.\n2A CSI MILS OF\nOLD DRAWING USED IN BEE GAMBIT\nI \"It is not a good thing\", thought Mr. Bee, \"that there\nare gentlemen among us who work too hard, if such a thing is\npossible\". Acting on this thought, he would procure a half\nfinished engineering drawing,- about six months old, an^ approach the gentleman who was most ahead in his drawing, \"Ex-cuse me\", Edmund Bee would say, \"can you please tell me how\nto construct the plan view from this elevation?\" This question so unnerved the other on finding Mr. Bee far behind\nin his course, that he was quite unable to work any more\nduring the day, and either retired for coffee or went home.\nMr. Bee did not restrict himself to one ploy, however,\nand there is on record a striking instance of the \"\nDON'T MIND WHAT PEOPLE SAT, IT'S VERY. SMART\" ploy, used by him\nwith great effect.\nA certain Mr. Grave was growing moustaches, but the\ngr j w th was somewhat inhibited. For a whole month after ^\nMr. Grave had embarked upon whisker ing his upper lip, Edmund Bee pretended not to notice, and then one Monday morning he said:\n\"What luxuriant moustaches you have there, Grave , old\nchap\".\n\"Oh, not really\", simpered Mr. Grave.\n\"But they are magnificent - vous I' a vez ech a ppe belle\",\nreturned Edmund Bee.\n\"Well, they're not so fine as Mr. Slater's, \"replied\nMr. Grave, who didn't speak French.\n\"Don't mind what people say, they're very smart\",\nploy ed Edmund and turned on his heel. The next day Mr.\nGrave was clean-3haven. The plo ying of academic superiors is best done incognito, such as from the bao k of a lecture theatre, unless\nthe Lifeman has reached stage three. The VICE-VKRSA ploy,\notherwise known as Oak's gambit, is devastating when used\ncorrectly. Mr. Oak, in company with many others, attended\nhourly lectures under the direction of a Mr. Te who\nwas wont to expound at great length on the beauty of certain\nmathematical formulae. After some time had elapsed, during\nwhich silence reigned, he stopped for want of words at the\nsentence \"... and so we see that the Ooriolis component acts in this direction if the body moves in that dire c tion\" .\nIn the hush that followed, Mr. Oak's s otto voice was\nheard to pronounce ... \" ..and vice-versa\".\n\"And vice-versa\", repeated Mr. T......e, completely\nploy ed. Many other instances of standard forms of Studentship\ngambits were given by Mr. Lentil, but la ok of 3pace prevents\nus from publishing them. At the next meeting of the I.C. Lifeman Sooiety'a talk will be given by Mr. Bee on \"Student-ship : Exam-man3 hip\". "

LOSE BY NARROW MARGIN\nIn the U.L. Athletios Championships at Mot spur Park\non Saturday, the I.C. men's team did not achieve the glory\nwh i oh was I.C. W.A's but nevertheless did better then ex pec ted, in finishing only 7 points behind U. O. AH who had anticipated amu oh more comfortable vio tory. Throughout the\nafternoon, the lead alternated between I.C. and U.C. but\nvictory was assured for U.C. when, with only the 440 yd s. to\nbe run, I.C. were leading by 3 points but had no finalist,\nwhile.the two.U.C. runners finished 1st and 4th.1.0.' s impressive total of 61 points was amassed as a result of a fine all round effort from the t \u00abam who gained\npoints in J?., of the 19 events. The Athletio Club has at\nlast learned that the I. C.W. A.t a ot ios pay dividends and many\nvaluable points were gained from the \"unpopular\" events, suo h as the hammer and pole vault.\nThe best individual performance o a me from John Evans,\nwho retained his mile title in the new I.C. reo or d time of\n4-14*7 to give I.C. their only first place. The hardest\nworker in the team was undoubtedly Terry Hyslop who ran in\nall three hurdles finals, finishing 2nd,3 rd and 6th in the\n120 yd s,220yd s., and 440 yd s., respectively. His times\nof 16*1 sees, end 26'7 sees, in the first two were both I.C. records. In the 3 miles, Trevor Bailey lost his title end\nUniversity reo or d to Richards of U.C. but ran better than of\nlate to finish 2no. He followed this with a very tired 4th pla oe in the mile.\nSTEWART FINISHES 2ND.

The throwing events were, as usual, disappointing hut bearded Phil Toynbee gained two useful 4th. places in the shot and hammer. In the latter event, Bunny\nSnellook, throwing for the first time in competition,\nremembered to let go at the^right time and finished 5th. Rather surprisingly, 1.0. had no finalists in the high\njump and long jump, \\at|in the hop,%t ep and jump, Snellook\nwas 4th. and Mike Browne\" 6th. Tne hurdles proved to be\nI.C.'s strongest department,; for in addition to Hyslop and\nPinsent, Tony Raeburn finished 5th. in both the 120yd s. and 220yd s. races. Mention too should be made of Oldfield,\nMeller and Turner who gained a point ea oh for their 6th. pla oe a in the walk, steeplechase and pole vault.\nHie unluckiest I.C. runner was Gordon Stewart who\nqualified for the final of the 880yd s. but whose fine 50.8\nsees, in his heat of the 440yd s. failed to give him a pla oe in the,\u00a3ia*U In the final of the 880yd s. he fought\nhis way th rou arJ i^ at nd.p lao e after using a vigorous\"\nbreast-stroke\\rt* action to force his way between two\nother runners U \u00bbJtfmtunately the U.C. captain appealed\nto the Refer** tri Gordon was disqualified.\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY \"FELIX\" AND C.R.

    "content": "FELIX59 h<m unie A> of %\nSPLOSH - \"and yet another Guildsman hits the Serpentine\".\nIt's a funny thing how sounds \"bring back memories of\noccasions in the past. Splosh always reminds me of last\nyear's Field Cup race. Not even the weather, Scotland\nYard, or the Home Secretary could prevent this annual battle taking place. The Aero dept. led practically all the\nway, until, contrary to rule 35 of the Field Cup race some\nmerman from one of the other departments managed to divert\ntheir path; and made way for the Civil Dept., who subsequently won.\nThe Field Cup was presented to Guilds in 19\u2014 (no record available) by a Mr. Field. It was intended that the\ndepartments in Guilds should select rowing teams from their\nranks, each oarsman not being a member of the Boat Club, and\nthey should all row for the cup. In the early days, only\nthe Mechar '\u2022< :-.-~tr.i. pr! Civils took part, but in recent years\nall depart mei j Cc..: \u2022\n. competed.\n195\"! stands out as the year in which the race to end\nall races was run. That is unique in the history of the\nrace, as no rowing was involved. 25 feet high sky lons were\nraced i Yom Exhibition Rd. to Battersea Power Station, transport being provided by the entrants. The result was very\nkindly judged by the gentlemen in blue, who were asked to\nchoose between a complete but in erect able skyl on, and an\nerect able but incomplete one. Fortunately for the Electrical Department, they chose the latter.\nThe celebration have not always been confined to Guilds,\nfor in 1953 one or two bodies from R.C.S. were present at the\nUnion meeting. Fortunately for Guilds, their presence was\ndetected by one or tw c Guildsmen Just following their noses\n(The stench being easily perceptible).\nFollowing the ejection of these stalwarts, Guilds, armed\nwith fire extinguishers and hoses soon damped out any contemplated R.C.S. participation in the festivities.\nGuilds then retired to Hyde Park and continued the pro-gram me. Apathy amongst the members of I.C. towards sporting and\nsocial activities has always been much criticised by other\ncolleges, and the Field Cup race is no exception. Any mention of the Riot Act seems to put the fear of God into most\nmembers of Guilds. It's not only in the last couple of years\neither: for in 1949, quote from Union Records: \"The Field\nCup had been dropped due to lack of support\" and in 1947\u00bb Mr.\nSynett asked whether it would be possible to restart the boat\nrao e on the Serpentine, between the Mechanicals and the Civils.\nMr. Arnot, a civil engineer, replied there was nothing he\nwould like better. It was not a Union matter but departmental.\nIt is hoped that this year there will be no lack of enthusiasm for the Race. It will be held on 31st May and now is\nthe time for you to start preparing plans and subterfuges to\nhelp your team along. However, due to the close proximity of\nthe general election, no H bombs PLEASE.\nSee you in the water, Guildsmen.\nA \"FELIX\" PHOTO OP THE 1952 FIELD CUP RACE.\n\\\n\\ /\n/\nPOSITIVELY MAGNIFICENT\nLast week (May 10-1 if), the Photo. Soo. held its Annual\nExhibition. The Society is indebted to Miss Ethel Miller\nA. R.P.S. for judging.\nHer comments about the prints as a whole were that\n\"extremely good technique was evident, but a fair number of /\nprints were too complicated involving poor arrangement of\nthe masses.\" This \"simplicity\" demanded by the Judge was\nthe keynote of the pri re winning entry in the Pictorial Class\nby R. Parry.\nThe Glaister Trophy for the best print in the Exhibition\nwent to a portrait of an I.C. Warian by T. Eyoott (R.S. M.). The Record Seotion winner was B.R.F. Cook (Guilds);\nand in this seo tion L. Dowdall is to be congratulated on his\nfine action shot of a Hawker Hunter A/C. College Activities, as usual, were poorly represented\n(Why?); so also was the colour print seo tion, but this was\nunderstandable (expense!)\nThe colour slides, to quote the Judge, \"were not of Exhibition standard, the o ol ours being too garish, and no thought\ntaken before shooting\". The individual winner was S. Paah.\nThe Exhibition was an han oed by first rate prints by Drs.\nGlaister and Heywood, former and present Presidents respect-iv ely. Summing up, the Exhibition showed definite improvement\nover last year as regard to technique, mounting and general\nlayout of the show.

After\nlistening to a statement from the secretary of the British\nYouth Festival Committee, they decided not to support the\nsending of any delegates to the Festival - as this might\nbe taken to entail agreement with its aims - but made\nclear that any team wishing to participate in the 3por ting\n- but not the political - events of the Warsaw Festival\nmay participate as official represent it ives of I.C. As a result, a semi official \"agency\" for popularising\nthe Festival has been set up in the college. FELIX sent\na reporter to the Festival \"Agents\" and the Following\ninterview took place with one of their spokesman:\nQ: What happens at the Festival?\nA: The Festival programme includes shows of songs,\ndances and plays of nearly every country in the world\na sports programme second only in size to the Olympic\ngames, and meetings between the delegations of tft e countries represented.\nQ: How many students from I.C. are going?\nA: Four at present \u2014 all as individuals.\nQ: Is participation compulsory?\nA: There is no obligation to attend any event in the\nFestival. Some visitors to previous festivals\nhave spent the whole of their stay looking around\nthe Festival city.\nQ: Will the opinions of I.C.d el agates pass as the\nopinions of I.C. and can this be used for Communist\npropaganda, or will it \"promote peaceful co-existence?\nA: It is explicit in the decision of Council that no\ndelegate has the authority to speak for I.C. The\nworst that can be said of Council is that they are\nprepared to allow a team from I.C. to play against\nteams from behind the 'Iron Curtain' and of course\nno one can prevent individual students of I.C. from\nattending the Festival. Your readers can decide\nfor themselves whether they consider that such a gathering will promote peaceful coexistence.\nHAMMERSMITH REGATTA Four crews were entered in the Hammersmith Regatta en Saturday 1V th.

That question is now\nbeing delved into by the Committee of the City and Guilds\nCollege Union.\nThe advantages of & running buffet are few tut imp or tant, namely economy and ease.of organisation. The fault\nof the buffet is great. After two weeks of finding his way\naround the long gloomy corridors, the fresher goes to the\nBuffet, where, although he is told to work hard and get\nall he o an out of \"College life\", he (the fresher) merely\ncomes away full of free beer and free food with the idea\nthat this College is a place for providing o heap( if not\nfree) entertainment. Thus, getting off to a bad start,\nthe student i a further influenced in this way of thinking\nby those around him. As I see many students, sub sidi sed though they are, their cry always seems to be \"something\nfor nothing or I do not want it t\"I do not suggest that this attitude is caused 1\n>\ny the\n\"beer-up\" of the Buffet but a fresher, who arrives at College and is treated to a reasonably sober dinner by another\nstudent, second or third year* will realise that he has: a certain amount of responsibility to the community which he\nhas joined. I have heard arguments to the eff eot that\nthe fresher oo ul d pay for his own dinner amongst the money\nhe pays to the College in entry fee, breakage deposit, etc;\nalso that the library donations scheme in wh i oh students\nleaving give the rest of their breakage deposit to the\npurchase of books, should support the fresher's 'dinner.\nAnd I say no I Why should the literary belly be starved\nfor the benefit of a few shillings pocket money of the second and third year students ? Let them actually pAve a chap a dinner even though, when they were fresher s they had\nsandwiches and sausages. Thy not \"nothing for something\".\nIn this act they will be able to fulfil some of their\nresponsibility to the College and to those who have established it for producing sound engineers; (and not merely\ntechnicians)\nThat the system works has been proved by the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union which has, 7. am ashamed to say as a Guildsman, a far better spirit and a more worthy average\nman. Indeed the Mines has something of that university\nair which the Guilds lacks.\nNow, with the majority of freshmen arriving at\nCollege straight from school)and probably very green, it is up to those who can, to teach them a little in the art of\nliving and the support of this scheme by the present first\nand seo on d years in the C&G, will go a long way to preventing this College from becoming just another te oh nio a loo lle ge in the years to oom e after the expansion.\nMay I say to those whom I might have offended,\n\"if the o ap fits, wear it\".

Prom 6 o 'clock onwards when\nthe first guests arrived, the new Council room began to fill with those people who have done most to aid the College in\nthe past year. The Rector, speaking at 7-30 to the assembled throng, emphasised that this year has been a most difficult one. The Union officers, he 3aid, were to be congratulated on their hard work and diligent labour which had not\ngone unnoticed. They had made the year a success in both\nthe social and academic spheres.\nAt this point, the reo tor was loudly applauded by his\ngnosis*\nCommemoration Day would be held on the 25th October in\nthe Albert Hall, the Rector announced. Lord Adrian would\npreside over the gathering, and eleven old members of the\nstaff would also be present at this celebration of the\nvisit of His Majesty the lot e Aing George VI on October\n25th1%6. After this no further news was received which meant that\nthey had either made it or were down in the sea.Finally at\n6.00 p.m. London Airport rang through to Lasham to relay a message relayed from Brussels. They had crossed the channel.\nThe glider landed in a Belgian field after a flight of 250\nmiles.\nIt now remains to get them back. The glider will have\nto be dismantled and taken to the nearest aerodrome. The\nTiger Moth can then be sent over to tow it back.\nIt seems appropriate that Frank should be the first to\ndo this as he has done a lot of work for British Gliding.\nFrank is on the British Gliding Association Technical Committee and is responsible for the issue of all gliding\ncertificates of air worthiness in this country and has been\nground crew in the British team at the last two World\nChampionships.\nSlingsby Type 42 Two-Seater\nMO'\nTYPE 42\n1\nTHE GLIDER IN WHICH HE CROSSED THE CHANNEL. '\nGUILDSMEN ENTERTAIN THEIR STAFF\nGUILDS SHERRY PARTY\nThe Guilds' Committee organised a very successful reception in the \"Squadron H.Q.\" on Tuesday 10th \"may. The\nobject was that the staff of the college who take an active\ninterest in student affairs might meet the committee and\ntheir guests for a chat and a glass of sherry. In this\nway next year's prospective Union officials were introduced\nand it is an under-estimation to say a good time was had by\nall.\nAs was hoped, many of the guests later attended Hall\ndinner, which with an attendance of 120 - in evening dress\n- must be an all time record.\nAfterwards the party continued (thanks to the hospitality of the Squadron) until well after midnight. The\nmain cabaret \"spot\", of this late night gathering was Basil\nEvans' rendering of his \"Lurgi?\" and many impromptu \"blues\".\nThe latter o ono er ned nearly every character in Guilds - staff\nand students alike. One verse referred to our esteemed dean\nof Residents P.G. I. whilst that same gentleman was almost\nbreathing down Basil'a neck. But oh - that chorus:\n\"Pass me another trifle, Ifcr, Ash! \".\n\n"

SOUTHGATE Circulation 1200\nIflhen the last Felix was published, I asked my fellow\nstudents what they thought of it, \"Too much Sport; too\nmuch Bar; not enough New3\", they said* I agree. There\nwas too much about sport - but remember that two tours took\npla oe over Easter. There was too much ao out the Bar - and\nespecially its colour. But ask yourself this - if the Bar\nis painted in this way, how will the new Union be decorated?\nWe're all going to use the Union when it is completed,\nand none of us want it looking like a modernistic monstrosity.\nSomeone had to stand firm, and FELIX is that someone.\nThere wasn't enough news. Well, to report news, news\nlias to be made. We can scarcely report that which doesn't happen!\nThis week, we've done our best to give you a good paper.\nIf you don't like what you see, write to us. If we haven't reported something which should have been reported, write to\nus. Above all, don't say \"It doesn't matter\". IT DOES.\nTHE BSGOTKING OF THE END\n\\\nThe sub-zones of the Carboniferous\nShould differ us\nFrom fleas in heliotrope pinstripes\nPlaying bagpipes\nThus spake a lady coal heave rI knew\nBut to be true\nI 've since found that she erred\n(Coalmen preferred -The Swine!) But turn the other cheek\nLet Mother speak\n\"My Son you'll have to learn to fight\nAnd even write\nAnd read and 'ri th metic ate and be inscrutable\nThat's irrefutable\nFor advanced Aya-Aya conte mpla tors And divers med it at or s, Thinkers, bolshevik dustmen and, the better me\nDo all agree\nThat if Skunks think like Skunks stink\n(Or drunks drink)\nHome will have among his friends\nSkunk Sapiens., '\nDonovan P. \"Ashwin\n(Philosopher Erotica to the Half Crowned Heads of Tales)\nWE STILL WANT MORE PEOPLE HELPING ON \"FELIX\"-ESEECIALtar TYPISTS !\nINTERNA TZONAL MEETING - PLACE.\nSome time ago one overseas student was overheard saying\nto another \"Englishmen, the cunning devils. Give them half\na chance and they'll worm their way into all the post-g radu ate courses at I.C.\" This was, of course, said in a joking\nfashion, \"but nevertheless it gives us some idea of the ever-increasing number of overseas students who annually come to\nGreat Britain to further their education, a fact the Home\nstudent should be proud to acknowledge, for does it not go\nto prove that perhaps Britain has a higher standard of education than almost any other country in the world?\nHowever, far too many of us are taking the overseas student for granted, and do not stop to think that perhaps these\n. students may feel rather lonely in this city of millions, or\neven a little home-sick, on remembering their climate, their\ncustoms, and their so often entirely different way of life.\nHow would we feel in similar conditions if for instance we\nstudied at Bombay, with not a soul paying any attention to\nus? We have a duty to perform to our overseas students,\nand an important duty at that.\nIt is therefore very satisfying to hear that yet another\noverseas student meeting place has recently been opened \"by\nthe Veryj Rev. Monsignor John L. Coonan S.T. L. It is the\nCatholic students international Chaplaincy at , Holland\nPark, London W.11( Tel. PAR 301*7). wh i oh is of course open\nto all students, national or international* The facilities\ninclude a chapel, library, lecture room, canteen, lounge etc.,\nand accommodation is available for a limited number of men\nstudents. The Chaplaincy is open daily from 10 a.m. to 10\np.m. and if anyone wishes to be notified of forthcoming events,\nhe should simply send his name and address to the above-men-tio ned address.\nFinally,, another point should be brought to the attention\nof the Home student. The overseas student will never feel at\nhome unless he meets his hosts, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that the home student should attend some of the\noverseas students' functions.\nMM.M Lm A PIECE OF NE3S THAT MISSED THE LAST\nISSUE: AT THE DRAM.

Evans was seen\nrecently on the roof of C&G shouting \" I can't stand it the work is getting me down.\" A large\ncrowd of passers-by accumulated, waiting for him to\njump. A pity he didn't. LORD W00LT0N, speaking last week, said that what\nwas needed in Manchester and Birmingham were Universities giving facilities like Oxford and Cambridge\nwhere the student would be able to\"live in\" for at\nleast one year during his undergraduate training.\nTHE DAILY EXPRESS, (another newspaper) published an\narticle a week ago, Friday May 13th., by James Bartl ett, in which he explained that 43 out of every 100\nstudy the arte. Opposed to this, 21 study pure science\nand 12 study technology. Out of university yearly,\ngrants, 4 goes to help science and technology.
