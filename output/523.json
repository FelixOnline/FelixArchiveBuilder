    "content": "Dear Sir, - In his letter of 15th June ( FELIX522) Mr Purewal\nclaims that he knew that I had\nwritten the letter signed 'Independent Observer\" ( FELIX521). In fact, he didn't know until\nI told bim. I have borne no\npersonal grudge against Mr Purewal, as he alleges. Indeed, if\nhe will care to read the India Soc\nelection memorandum, he will\nfind that I was one of the people\nwho proposed him for the\npresidency. It was Mr Purewal's reaction to his defeat, rather than\nany animosity, which prompted\nme to write to FELIX. Yours faithfully.\nV Dhanak\nDear John. Just dropping a line\nto let you know that whatever\nSonia may or may not write, or\neven if she only thinks it; we\ndisagree with it.\nRick Archer Sean O 'Boyle\nChris Fox\nMich Maghar Dear John, I am glad that my\nletter of two weeks ago, of which\nthe prime purpose was to fill a quarter page space on page 2 of\nFELIX, has given rise to\ncorrespondence filling half a page.\nFrom the three letters of last\nweek it seems that the higher\nechelons of the Royal College of\nScience Union do not themselves\nknow exactly what they are to do\nabout the stripper at their\n'Revue'.\nSo may I venture a final\nopinion and say that the featuring\nof a stripper might be just slightly\ninconsistent with the intention of\nputting on a quality revue.\nAs for Chris Fox, no doubt he\nwill learn during his year as ICU President to express himself\naccurately and unambiguously,\nor he will have trouble not only\nwith FELIX reporters.\nTo return once again to the\nproblem of the 'undemocratic\nminorities', this concept was only\nvoiced to me by Chris Fox in\nanswer to a question about\nwhether protests by women had\nbeen a factor contributing to the\nchange in the nature of Smoking\nConcert. I did not need to 'divine\nChris' thoughts' as Sean O 'Boyle\nmakes out. I still fail to see how\nanyone can construe that Chris\nmeant any other group than the\nwomen protesters referred to in\nthe question. If he did then he was\neven more inept in his use of the\nEnglish language than he makes\nout.\nHowever, only Rich Archer,\nSean O 'Boyle and Mick Maghar claim to explain which other\npeople Chris meant while Chris\n\u2022 himself remains silent. As this is\nthe last FELIX this term we shall\nprobably never know.\nOne more point from Mick' s5.5 inch paragraph, yes I was at\nSmoking Concert and 1 thought\nthat most of the audience was\nguilty of disruption and excess\nconsumption of free beer. But this\nis irrelevant to the argument\nabout undemocratic minorities.\nI wish next year's Revue\norganisers the best of luck in their\nattempts to persuade the\naudience to behave themselves.\nSean claims that Rich Archer\nexplained the reasons for the\nname 'Highlights Revue', and\nthen justifies Rich's lack of\nexplanation by saying that the\nname is obvious. Obvious it may\nbe to you and many others, but\nthere are people to whom it is not\nat all obvious. Saying that it is\nobvious does not in any case\nconstitute an explanation. Not\neveryone watches the same\ntelevision programmes.\nIam glad that Sean does not\nmind people airing their views in\npublic. It would be a sad day for\nthe democratic body which he\nheads if he did mind. Finally, having livened up your\nlast few FELICE S with a bit of\nnot too serious correspondence, I hope everyone has a good summer\nand perhaps we shall meet again\nsome day.\nYours sincerely,\nSonia Hochfelder\nP.S. In view of their letter\nelsewhere on this page, may I assure readers that I think RCS LI is wonderful.\nSir, - I do not recall any response\nfrom IC Executive or Council\nhaving been made on Barrv\nAustin's letter in FELIX No. 520.\nPresumably, Council had just\nquietly ignored the points\ncontained in that letter! Well, I for one object to such an attitude,\nbecause an important principle is\ninvolved.\nIf Parliament passes a particular Act that happens to be\nfaulty, the Government has no\npower to presume a 'correct'\nversion of that Act - it has to\nintroduce a Bill into Parliament\nto amend the existing legislation,\nthereby removing the mistakes. It\nis only after this that the 'correct'\nversion becomes law.\nNow all this applies, by\nanalogy, to IC Union. AUG M may pass a particular policy. This\nmay include particular mandates\nor directives. But for these to have\nany effect, they must be phrased\nin the correct terms. ICU Council\nhas no power to take the attitude,\n'Well, the U GM really meant\nsuch and such, even though they\ndidn't actually say that, so that's what we will do.' If Council are\nuncertain, or if they would like a particular policy of aUG M altered, then they have to bring\nthe matter before another U GM, which may or may not agree with\nthem.\nBarry Austin is right about the\nlatest motion on Abortion: I had\nalready pointed out to several\npeople including Barry Austin,\n(before the motion was discussed),\nthat, in that form, it could not be\nunderstood as instructing t InExecutive or Council to do\nanything. I had not noticed the\ninternal inconsistencies that\nBarry has pointed out, although\nthese seem to result from the\namendment. Neither had I noticed that the policy could not\naffect any existing policy, as has\nbeen correctly shown in Barry's letter. It is no use whatever\nCouncil saying that the policy\nmeant to do these things - if the\nproponents of such ideas cannot\nfind from amongst themselves\narticulate, clear-headed persons\ncapable of drafting a simple little\npolicy motion, then that's just too\nbad. The only problem with ICU is that there is no system like the\ncourts to restrain Council or the\nExecutive from acting beyond\ntheir proper powers.\nI can only hope that the next\nCouncil will not be so blatantly\nhigh-handed as to invent new\npowers for itself! If the policy on\nthe ' NAC' has been 'deleted' by\nthis present Council, then it is the\nduty of the incoming Council to\n\u2022overturn such a decision and, on\nbehalf of their predecessors, to\napologise to the next U GM for\nhaving previously acted ultra\nvire s( beyond their proper powers).\nYours faithfully,\nTony Leech,\nMaterials Science 3\nll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll lt ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll SCIENCE RESEARCH\nCOUNCIL:\nRESEARCH STUDENTSHIPS\nCLEARINGHOUSE FOR ENGINEERING RESEARCH STUDENTSHIPS - 1979\nThe Council's Engineering Board has been concerned at the low\ntake-up of its quota research studentships in recent years and new\narrangements are being made for the 1979 awarding exercise to\nimprove the situation. A clearing house for students seeking\nengineering research studentships will operate in the period 11 June31 July. There will also be a small reserve of studentships available to\ndepartments that have filled their quota studentship allocations and\nhave further eligible candidates seeking awards. We hope that this will\nhelp departments achieve a full take-up of their quota allocations.\nThe normal S RC Appeals procedure will continue to redistribute\nunused studentships during August in the first instance in accordance\nwith Council's general allocation between Science and Engineering. In\nprevious years the Appeals exercise has been too late for some students\nsince by then they had made other arrangements - hence the clearing\nhouse exercise this year.\nProspective research students are advised in the first instance to\ncontact the head of the relevant department to see if quota studentships\nare available. In case of difficulty students should telephone the S RC Engineering Secretariat for details of departments that have unfilled\nstudentships. This clearing house will operate between 11 June and 31\nJuly 1979, Departments which have difficulty in filling their quotas may\nalso contact the Engineering Secretariat (Mrs Marion Bird, Swindon\n(0793) 26222, Extension 2429) for names of students seeking awards.\nThere will be a reserve of up to 24 research studentships which may\nbe applied for on a first come first served basis by departments that have\nfilled their quota research studentships ie when S RC has received as\nmany applications for eligible students as allocated. Nominations of\neligible candidates for reserve studentships should be made in the\nnormal way except that the top of the front page of the application form\nmust be marked Clearing House Reserve.\nStudentships from this reserve will cease to be available after 31 July\n1979 when the normal S RC Appeals procedure operates.\nThese arrangements will apply only to quota research studentships\nallocated by the Science Research Concil's Engineering Board; they do\nnot apply to Case Awards.\nIll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll l "

    "content": "REVIEWS I 'Back to the Egg' - Wings\nIt's strange that the word\n'album' should be used to\ndescribe LP records. Normally,\nthe word refers to a collection, a group of things with a common\ntheme - 1,238 pictures of Auntie\nMargie on Blackpool Pier every\nsummer since 1949. With records,\nhowever, it's often impossible to\nregard them as anything but 10\nsongs coincidentally on the same\ndisc. So it is with this 'album'.\nWings, under Paul McCartney,\nhave always produced very varied\nrecords - the sheer range of songs\nis impressive - but on this new\ncollection it would seem that\nMcCartney has lost his way. Not\nonly are the songs almost\nconfusingly varied in pace and\nstyle, but many hark back (or\nacross) to some other Wings\nopus. (Is the title 'Back to the Egg'\na clue??)\nHaving said all that, I must add\nthat the music is very good, and I like the record very much indeed.\nThere are, of course, the weak\npoints - for instance, on how many\nrecords have you heard the old\ntrick of tuning a radio into a song\nwhich just happens to be the next\non the record? If this trick annoys\nyou (and it certainly does me),\nthen try and avoid track 1, side 1,\n'Reception'. Not an auspicious\nstart - the music itself is fine, but\nwhy oh why throw in the effects?\nFrom there on in, you have to\nkeep your wits about you. The\nnext song 'Getting Closer', is a good Wings soft-rocker, followed\nquickly by a typical McCartney\nballad-style crooner, 'We're open\ntonight'. Then headlong and\nhead bang into the fast and furious\n'Spin it on' - almost New Wave,\nthis. See what I mean about\nvariety? And we're only halfway\nthrough side 1.\nThe slightly worrying thing\nabout it all is; a lot of it has been\ndone before - by McCartney\nhimself. Phrases that I have just\nused, like ' - a typical Wings...' are\nthe give-away. Make no mistake,\nthey're all good, but then they\nwere when he did them the first\ntime.\nA slight change comes with 2 of\nthe tracks on side 2, featuring the\nfamed 'Rockestra'. I'm sure you\nremember last summer, and the\ndark muttering s about the\ngreatest collection of Rock musicians ...' and so on - all\nsupposedly recording together\nfor McCartney. The fruits of these\nsessions are on side 2 - the\n'Rockestra Theme' and 'So glad to\nsee you here'. So, if you've always\nwanted to hear the sound of 5\nguitarists, 3 drummers, 4 bassists,\n3 pianists, 2 'keyboard' players, 4\npercussionists (non-drummers?),\nand 4 Horn players all slogging\naway together, then this is for you.\nThis combination has limited\ninterest - give me a spoons and\ncomb duet any day.\nSo what are the conclusions?\nWell, Wings are marking time with\nthis one. It's good, and will find its\nway into the collections of all\nMcCartney devotees, and a few\nothers too. And by the way, my\nfavourite song is 'After the Ball' - it\nsounds just like 'Amazing Grace'.\nOh what a give-away ...\nSimon Milner\nRickie Lee JonesRickie Lee Jones (Warner\nBros).\nA few weeks ago the ' Old Grey\nWhistle Test' did a short feature\non Rickie Lee Jones, showing a wonderfully produced promotional film of herself walking\naround town and pe forming with\nher band. Together the film and\nthe pair of songs stirred up enough\ninterest that the release of the\nsingle did not go unnoticed\n(although IC Radio were unable\nto play it) and the single ' Chuck E's in Love' persuaded me to go\nout and get a copy of the album.\nAlthough I did not know quite\nwhat to expect I fell in love with\nthe album right away.\nThis girl, coming from the same\nbackground as the Eagles, Steve\nMiller and similar West Coast\nMusicians, has come out with a style of her own, virtually singing\nthe Blues.\nIn one way the music sounds\ndisjointed, though disjointed maybe inaccurate, there is a coherency about it, yet each note\nfrom each instrument seems to\nhave been individually placed,\noften only seeming to blend\ntogether, when strung together\nwith the singing.\nShe has already been compared\nwith Springsteen, and perhaps\nthe lyrics do have some quality in\ncommon with some of his, yet this\nalbum is infinitely more relaxing,\nthe vocals more controlled, more\ncompelling listening and she is\ncertainly prettier.\nThe closest comparison must\nbe, and I don't mean to be too\nrude, Merrie Wilson. RL J manages to give the same\npersonal feel to a song, in the\nbreathy loose way the lyrics roll\nol f her tongue.\nThe musicianship of the\nbacking band seems to be quietly-competent whilst doing little else\nbut accentuating the vocals, until\nit gets pushed to the front, as in\n' Young Blood' especially when\nthe music becomes a lot tighter\nand the sound gets much more\nexciting instrumentally.\nIf you're one of those people i that read a lot into the Lyrics of a song you may be disappointed\nwith these: although at first sight\nthey appear to be trying to say a lot, upon closer inspection they\nbecome casual observations\nrather than constructive comments on anything. Rickie\nLee Jones sometimes sings in such\na way that words arc barely-distinguishable and are more\nimportant for the mood and tone\nin which they are such than for\ntheir content.\nThere are two tracks worth\nsingling out from the rest. One,\nthe single ' Chuck E's in Love'\ngives a good standard for assessing\nthe rest of the album, although it\nis perhaps a little more catchy and\nir resist able than most tracks it\nrelies on a slow rhythm\nstrummed out on guitar, with a slightly unimaginative drum section, backing up RL J singing\nup front.\nAlso, 'Danny's All Star Joint'bringing back memories of\n'Telephone Man' by Merrie\nWilson, - which if you can\nunderstand all the American\nslang stands out as the strongest\ntrack on the album, here RL J moves much more towards jazz\nthan on any of the other tracks.\nSo il you're looking for\n^something a little laid back to\nrelax to I'd go as far as\nrecommending this.\nChris Watts\nJOHN OTWAYWhere did I go Right (Polydor)\nJohn Otway has had a reputation as a real head case.\nWell forget that, because on this\nshowing he's calmed down so\nmuch that even Clement Freud\nseems lively in comparison. The\nmusic has always been pretty\nbasic, but the lyrics of the OtwayWild Willy Barrett duo easily\novercompensated. Thinking back\nto the classics, 'Really Free',\n'Josephine' and 'Beware of the\nFlowers' (for example), all had\namusing, interesting and very\naccessible story lines What we\nhave here is bland music and\nlyrics that are either boring and\nclich ed or just plain unintelligible.\n'Where did I go right,' asks Otway.\nLet's face it, John, you're not\nfooling anyone.\nYet the album title sums up the\nOtway spi rt;a cross between\nconfidence (I have succeeded) and\nanarchic al self destruction( despite all my efforts to the\ncontrary, I have succeeded),\nwhich has in the past worked but\nin this case flounders.\nRedeeming features? Well the\nproduction of Neil Innes (of\nBonzo Dog Band and Monty\nPython fame) is excellent, so at\nleast every track has a fighting\nchance, but somehow something\nalways pulls it down. The clich es, the painfully old-fashioned music\nor just the fact that the song is no\ngood. But back at the good bits:\nurn, there aren't any more. What\nthis album does have is three\ngood tracks but that's hardly a recommendation to buy.\nAll the songs on the LP, which\nincident ly lasts all of thirty five\nminutes, are written by Otway,\nexcept 'The Highwayman', a superb adaptation of a poem by\nAlfred Noyes, which is far and\naway the best track, and it's not\neven recent material. Synthesised\nwind, atmospheric organ music\nand Otway's curious vocal style all\nlend themselves to the fine\nrendition. The opening number,\n'Makes good music', provides a solid foundation for the album,\nthe infectious rhythm of this semi-autobiographical song blending\nneatly with the vocals. 'What\nbetter time than now to take a look\nat your life,' Otway sings, 'guess\nyou never got nothing right.'\nThe only other track worth an\nhonourable mention is 'Blue Eyes\nof the Belle', a slow, graceful song\nof young love and marital loyalty;\n'their's was a love that could never\nbe' - type slush - but it works.\nThe current single, 'Frightened\nand Scared', is so nondescript\nthat I couldn't even remember\nwhich track it was after I first\nheard the album. But then the\nwhole thing is like that - stark,\nsometimes purposely so, with\nlittle relief. In fact I actually fell\nasleep listening to the first side, so\nI suppose it may pick up on the\ninsomniac's market i \u201e \u201e C i,fK "

All the more commendable considering he was also\nCivil Engineering Departmental Representative, on countless Union\ncommittees and trying hard to get a degree.

IC Liberal Club was formed in\nI974 when Alan Beith, MP,\nattended the inaugural meeting.\nSince then many distinguished\npoliticians have spoken at Club meetings and events, including Jo\nGrimond, Lord Gladwyn, Peter\nHain, Lord Avebury, and, most\nrecently, the Liberal leader David\nSteel, who opened the national\nconference of the Union of Liberal\nStudents which was organised by\nOn Wednesday 13th June (unlucky for some) a notorious\nbunch from the Royal College of Science descended upon\nCharing Cross Station at 8 a.m. en route for Calais.\nA crate of Swan later they arrived in Dover and then suffered\na Channel crossing by hovercraft.\nOn arrival in \" la belle France\" and having exasperated the bus\ndriver by offering 50 franc notes for a3 franc journey, it was decided to\npartake in a cup of \"cafe au lait\". This created total confusion even with\nthe help of Steve's French dictionary - but they succeeded in the end.\nAs the French are an hour ahead they arrived with all the shops\nclosed for lunch. This decided the course of action and everyone went\ntheir separate ways.\nSome members of the party felt very extravagant and invested in\noysters, lobster and numerous bottles of wine. Others had French bread\nand plo nk at 3 francs a bottle in the park.\nA stock of wine was built up before boarding the bus to the hover port where a large amount of duty free spirits was purchased. But\nunfortunately the homeward journey was rather rough and poor\nPatrick lost his lobster!\nBack on the train once the wine was produced the carriage cleared\nrapidly due to the singing of those very polite songs everyone knows so\nwell!\nThe intrepid band arrived back in London at 9 p.m. with plenty of\ntime to get to the Union Bar before closing time.

    "content": "Twittens I Have Known...\nfrom an Original Idea\nby Pete Spencer-Phillips\nand written by Sheyne Lucock\nThe astonishing fact that you're still\nreading FELIX now at the end of the year\nprobably means that you're an even more\navid reader than the Editor, who gave up\nreading it himself after the first three issues!\nSo who is this Editor - the face behind page\nthree? Quite obviously some of you will think\nhe's a complete idiot and you could have\ndone much better yourself. Others will have\nbeen continually amazed at the ever\nincreasing standard of technical excellence\nwith each passing issue.\nANGELIC\nAt first, John Harris seemed such a quiet\nand unassuming lad, exuding innocence\nfrom somewhat angelic features. Though\nthings are not always what they seem, and in\nthis case, could not have been further from\nthe truth.\nPASSION\nIt all started on the PG Outing to\nCambridge last July which was also attended\nby the three sabbaticals. The Beer Festival.\nThe punting (with someone falling in). The\neffect was traumatic. From lager and lime and\nFELIX to real ale and passion overnight.\nPERSEVERENCE\nDuring the autumn term, the fact that FELIX\nappeared at all is a great credit to John's persevere n ce and dedication. Practically\nsingle-handed, often working right through\nthe night at least twice a week, he produced\nissues of FELIX to a standard far higher than\nin previous years, which was undoubtedly\nresponsible for attracting and keeping the\nhigh calibre student staff he has been blessed\nwith for the last two terms.\nFOIBLES\nBut do FELIX Editors have time for\nanything else? Certainly John's main\npreoccupation outside the FELIX office is\nspending as much time as possible in the\nBot/ Zoo Common Room, which is\nconveniently situated just three yards away.\nAs it approaches ten o 'clock there is a definite\nspeeding up of the metabolic rate, ary th mic twitching of the drinking paw, a nervous\nrolling of the eyes and then - wham! He's gone! When the dust clears, one is able to\nfollow the well-worn tracks leading direct to\nthe serving hatch, where, in the midst of what\nappears to be a cataleptic fit, a cup of tea and\na caramel wafer are hustled away to be\nconsumed with even greater vigour than the\nday before. Once more, calm is restored -until just before three o 'clock, when the same\nritual is repeated. Although now, of course,\nMrs Adams' sir resist able charm and tea-making expertise means that the\npreliminary drooling is maintained for at least\nanother half-hour. And his Mum can't understand why he's started to drink tea after\nall these years!\nWhile we're on the subject of foibles, John\ncertainly has plenty, and it's difficult to know\nwhere to start to describe them.\nPerhaps the most ob sure foibles relate to\nthe two pictures on this page. The Stockpot\nRestaurant is a rather nice, relatively cheap\nplace to eat not too far from College - just\nbehind Harrods. So I can't think why he'd travel miles to the one near Duke Street ?\nEcstasy!\nMORE FOIBLES\nThe second most obscure foible relates to\nthe model (illustrated) - one of many he has\nbuilt in his spare time - of what is purported to\nbe a nucleotide (fundamental building block\nof DNA) of quite peculiar stereochemical\nproportions. Not that John is a biologist, but\nprolonged exposure to complex biological\nchit-chat over tea twice a day can seriously\naffect anyone's mental health - and FELIX\nEditors are more susceptible than most to any\nkind of royalty - whether they be Duchesses\nof Duke St or not!\nThere's more! He reads dictionaries!\nGeological ones. Physical ones. And, you\nguessed it, Biological ones! But he doesn't stop there. He actually bought a copy of an\nexcellent Biology A level text-book, and\nstarted to wade through it from chapter one.\nIt'll be point quad rats in Beit Quad next!\nNOCTURNAL\nApart from the PG trip to Cambridge, a lot\nof interesting things have happened during\nthe year. Like there was the time we decided\nto go with Roger Stotesbury for a drink in Kew\none night. \"Are you sure it's quicker to go to\nGunnersbury Station?\" asked John when it\nwas time to go home. We never found it, but\nhad to walk all the way back to College, on the\nway calling at a Chinese take-away in the\nFulham Palace Road which John assured us\ndid quite excellent nocturnal chips, having\noften frequented it in the middle of the night.\nWhy? We never did find out, but apparently\nit's better than Westminster Bridge at one in\nthe morning.\nHe used to go to Barnet a lot, too. Well, it'sa\nnice place is Barnet - right at the end of the\nNorthern Line.\nCOLD FINGERS\nIt was probably a taste for adventure that\ninduced him to spend a frozen weekend\ndelivering 1500 leaflets in a small seaside\ntown on the East Coast for a political cause\nthat he had never expressed a loyalty to,\nadvertising a meeting with the well-known\ngourmet Clement Freud. When your fingers\nare that cold, and you get them trapped in that\nmany vicious letter boxes, then I would have\nthought you'd never want to see the place\nagain. Not a bit of it. Back the next weekend\nfor an encounter with the man himself, and\nmore frozen fingers.\nCONSCIENCE\nThe disappointment of never having got it\ntogether with the other two sabbaticals who\nalso live in Room 434 Linstead (a grammatical\nerror in one of his first issues which led to all\nkinds of confusions & interests) was never\nquite overcome in spite of the thrill of marking\nup Mel Kinkie's deliciously erotic articles\neach week. So he developed a social\nconscience to make up for it. From a truly\nright-wing reactionary view-point and an\nabsolute mistrust of anything red or feminist\nand Mary in particular, there has been a steady shift in both his opinions and ideas\nnever parallelled in the course of history.\nPerhaps the most striking event in this\ntransformation was the result of an hour-long\ndiscussion over a Mooney with Mary one\nSunday night (it takes that long to chew it -the Mooney, not Mary) on the fine details of\nthe Single Transferable Vote. Now, believe it\nor not, but the new FELIX Society is the only\nUnion club which elects its officers and\ncommittee by proportional representation!!\nHe's even got to the stage of beating such\nseasoned campaigners such as Mary and\nmyself at a quite complex General Election\nBoard Game - but Risk! is probably still his\nfavourite.\nFROGS\nNew information recently came to light\nduring a close inspection of his native habitat\nin Bath. It was then that Mary realised where\nshe'd seen those eyes before. Frogs. Lots of\nthem. They stare at each other for hours,\nthem probably remembering the days when\nhe used to catch flies and dangle them on bits\nof string for their supper. He also used to have\na meaningful relationship with a large white\nrabbit. Used to take it for walk ies on a lead.\nInto the woods. Say no more.\nUsually when you write a profile of\nsomeone, the temptation is to exaggerate.\nFortunately I haven't had to. It's with regret\nthat one realises that John could end up on\nthe traditional straight career ladder along\nwith everyone else leaving all his foibles\nbehind him. That would be a pity.\nOpposite Duke St.\niii iii iii iii im mimi l mim in imi mini iii mim mimi "

Many travelled from far distant\nworlds to come to Imperia and looked strange compared to the ordinary inhabitants\nof the continent of Ken Sing Ton in which Imperia stood. Creatures from overseas,\n(Yellow y ill on s, green garr ions, and red ran s is) played happily with the blue biz on s that came from local continents.\nIn the beginning the magic was all good magic and the creatures used wisely the\nmany bags of gold placed in their position by other inhabitants of the continent.\nHowever, it cannot be assumed that the creatures met no problems. Surrounding the\nland of Imperia was a great forest.\nEach of our friendly creatures could have built his own tree hut with plenty of space.\nHowever, the land was ruled by the Talists who employed black demons called Capits.\nThe Capits could ll y from tree to tree protecting them from occupation even if their own masters had no purpose in mind for the trees. The fli gh. of the Capits was a terrible sight. As they\nrose in groups to light off any offenders against their rule, the very sun itself would be blotted out\nby a huge black cloud of squalling flesh.\nOur creatures lived in fear ol the Capits and the Talists who controlled the trees outside their\nlittle land, so they tried to grow their own trees inside the boundaries of safety. The trees grew\nslowly and space became scarce because the ground was filled with the equipment they needed\nto successfully perform their magic. Eventually, despite the creatures sharing many trees many\nhad to seek a compromise with the demons outside and they bribed the Capits with gold. One of\nthe smallest pots of gold was given to the individual creatures in order to keep a tree hut in good\norder and buy l bod and personal equipment. The creatures had to offer up to half of what they\nhad been given this way in order to be able to bribe the greedy Capits.\nBecause of the problem ol the trees and many other problems all the creatures of Imperia met\ntogether and had a great discussion. The whole land was lil led with the chatter of voices and the\nCapits lied for a while from the edge of the forest in fear of the sound of so many y ill on s, garr ions biz on s and ran s is meeting together. They decided to form a great organisation called the Onion. It would be called the Onion because it would bring them close together like the layers ol an onion and because, while its organisations would grow, like the onion, underground, its leaves\non the surface would spread manifold from the effect of their actions.\nThey elected many leaders lor the Onion and the leaders appointed wise people to help them\nfind the best action to take and to help organise the parties and other activities, (sports like\ngambolling, reacting and som bling). organise tl by the Onion. You may have thought that only the\ncreatures of the land ruled over the magic in\nImperia and decided how to guard the pots of\ngold but in this I would have misled you.\nOver the land there in fact ruled a Baron who\nwas appointed by the Wizard Dcsdree\n(known as Des for short). Des and his servant,\nUnit i a Grasson Conti( known as UGC), issued edicts to the Baron and the Baron\nwould have to accept their wrath if he\ndisobeyed.\nThe Baron appointed servants to guard the\npots of gold which were stored in his castle in\nthe centre of the land. The Baron would often\nlean out of level 5 of his castle and stare\naround at the land he controlled. However,\nthe Baron did not always rule wisely. Often\nhe was too busy to take not ice of the problems\nof the creatures in his control even when the\nleaders of the Onion came to see him. The Baron travelled to different continents or\nsometimes he went off to play games with\nother Barons from that continent who held\ngreat meetings.\nThe sen ants appointed by the Baron were\nstrange animals. Not all liked the little\ncreatures inhabiting the land. One such was a wolf called Sammy who guarded the pot of\ngold that was meant to help the little\ncreatures grow good food to live oil. The wolf\nlike the look of the gold and didn't like to\nallow any ol it out of the pot. He would howl\nall night staring at the gold & during the day\nsilently pad around the levels of the castle\nwith a hungry look of hatred in his eyes. It\nwas rumoured that in his past Sammy had\nworked for the Talists and most thought he\nwould be better serving the creatures of the\nwild forest. The Onion organised its member\ncreatures to organise raids on this pot and were sometimes successful in bettering their\nlot - but that is another story.\nThe purpose of this story is to tell of a time\nwhen the wizardry of Des came under the\ncontrol of evil people within the continent.\nThese evil people wanted to foster hatred\namongst the people of the continent and claimed that the pots of gold in Imperia (and\nother such lands were being used for outside\npurposes. They wished to take control of the\nmagic learnt and developed at Imperia to use\nonly for their own people and did not want it\nto be shared amongst the people of the world\nand the universe.\nA time came to pass when Des and UGC ordered the Baron to create a new pot of gold\nto be many times greater than the ones\nalready in his possession. He was to use the\nsweat and labour of the green garr ions, the\nred ran s is and yellow y ill on s.He was to make\nthem all pay into the pot and if they did not\nhe would whip them and torture them until\nthey would be forced to leave the land of\nImperia.\nThe day the Baron boomed bis\nannouncement out of the castle the creatures\nwept and wailed. The Onion organised many\nbig meetings and everyone was united\nagainst the creation of the new pot. The Baron said that he had no choice but to obey\nDes or else he would himself IK: sent from the\nland. The( real tires from overseas worked\nhard in the outside forests to try to gain some\ngold but the Talists paid them little. Later,\nthe evil people controlling Des also ordered\nthe Talists only to employ creatures from\ntheir own continent. The creatures from\noverseas could then only rely on help from\ntheir homelands. There was much poverty\namongst the garr ions, y ill ions, etc, and the\nOnion pleaded with the Baron to be merciful.\nFor a time the Baron whipped and tortured\nlew and the community was able to be\nrelatively peaceful.\nThen, one autumn, as the trees in the forest\nglinted red, brown and yellow in the light of\nthe sun low in the sky a terrible cry set up in\nthe land. The leaders ol the Onion rushed to\nthe castle. In front of the castle ranged the\nBaron and all his servants, each carrying\nsome terrible instrument of torture and threatening a cowering creature from\noverseas. Above the crowd towered the vision\nof Des, dressed in Black and perching on the\ntop ol the castle checking that his edicts were\nperformed. The noise of screaming and shouting filled the air and the Capits in\ncuriosity flew over above until, seeing Des,\nthey scattered back in the forest.\nThe creatures from overseas began to leave\nthe land. The magic ol the land was no longer\nso great and much new magic was not\ndeveloped. However, the torture continued\nand the land never returned to its happy\ncontentment.\nEventually the blue biz on s were the only\nones remaining and they were sad at having\nlost their friends and there was much mourning in the land.\nxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx There is one small chance that you\ncould help prevent that terrifying\nautumn from coming about. Go out now\nand demonstrate outside\n170 Queen's Gate\nat the\nMEETING OF GOVERNORS\n10.30am TODAY\nYou can save the yellow y ill on s, green\ngarr ions and red ran s is and protect the\ngood magic of Imperia.\nMARY ATTENBOROUGH Onion President\ni mimi iii iii iii iii iii iii iii imI III III Iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii "

This decision followed naturally from Union policy in\nsupport of gay rights and the legal is ation of cannabis, he argued.\nCouncil had made fornication a discipline offence in 1974, a policy\nrevoked by this week's decision. It will be up to the Executive to decide\nwhen sex is \"un avoid a be\". The meeting was attended by\nmembers of both the current and\nthe incoming Councils.

    "content": "4\nREVIEWS I A Leper's Tale The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant - The\nUnbeliever. (Fontana).\nWhen I first started reading this trilogy by\nStephen Donaldson I thought 'Oh dear! A Lord of the Rings -American Style'. The map\ninside the front cover, the Land with its\nmagical inhabitants, the volcano and the\nthreat of an evil Lord Foul started bells\nringing in my head like noon in a clock-makers. The further I read, the worse it got: a magical talisman, The Staff of Law, had been\nlost during the last battle with Foul and\nrecently found by this demented creature,\nDrool Rockworm, who lives under a mountain. Sound familiar? But just as I was\nprepared to slate these three books into the\nground the story takes a very unusual twist.\nLord Foul's Bane\nMeet Thomas Covenant, writer and happily\nmarried modern-day American whose life is\nshattered when the doctors tell him he has\nleprosy. He becomes an outcast, divorced by\nhis wife and shunned by the townsfolk who\ngo to such lengths as paying his bills to\nremove any excuse he may have for visiting\nthe town. Determined to fight back against\nsocial ostracism, Covenant marches defiantly into town, but while crossing the\nroad is run down by a police car.\nHe awakes in the Land, a virtual paradise,\nwhose inhabitants hail him as the reincarnation of a legendary hero. This is where\nDonaldson departs from the traditional good\nvs evil fair ty tale. There is no straight battle\nbetween opposing forces here. Lord Foul has\na complex forty-nine year plan for conquest\nof the Land which involves manipulating the\nLand's protectors, the Lords, for his own\nends. Lord Foul tells Covenant to warn the\nLords and also that Drool Rockworm has\nfound the Staff of Law.\nThroughout his time in the Land, though,\nCovenant stubbornly refuses that any of it\nexists. He maintains that he is dreaming and\nthat the Land & its peoples are figments of\nhis deranged mind: believing himself to be in\na coma following the car accident.\nBeing a leper, and therefore without any\nhope of being cured, Covenant has to\npreserve his precious self-disciplines. Any cut or bruise can deteriorate his condition\nand lead to a hideous death by cumulative\nrotting. He sees the Land as a seduction he\nmust resist, for it he drops his defences then\nhe will surely die in the 'real' world when he\nwakes up. Each time Covenant steels himself\nagainst the beauty of the Land his resolve is\nworn down. The 'Illusion' that his leprosy is\ncured, the health and vitality of the\ncountryside, the trust of the people, all\ncombine to drive him insane if he trusts his\nsenses. Never before have I read about a more unlikely, or more unwilling, hero.\nYet by maintaining his own integrity\nCovenant becomes Foul's pawn, unwittingly\ncausing suffering and betraying those who\ntrusted him.\nThe position of the Lords is hardly much\nbetter. Sworn to an Oath of Peace, they find\nthemselves forced to defend the Land against\nFoul using the minimum of force. Can they\ntrust Covenant? Do they have any choice?\nPlagued by self-doubt, they must join forces\nwith Covenant against Foul in the hope that\nthe former will be able to use his magic white-gold wedding ring. But despite the legends\npromising 'salvation or damnation' from the\nwi elder of the wild magic, to Covenant his\nring remains a painful reminder of his broken\nmarriage.\nThe first book sets the scene and\nintroduces many of the characters that\nappear in the following books. On the surface\nit is a simple story concerning the Quest for\nthe Staff of Law, but many of Covenant's actions have far - reaching repercussions\nwhich only become apparent in the third\nbook.\nThe Power That Preserves\nDespite having failed the Land on the\nprevious occasions Covenant is summoned\nfor a third time, two years before the\ncompletion of Foul's scheme. Foul has all but\nsucceeded in enslaving the Land. The once\nbeautiful countryside is now held in the grip\nof an unnatural winter and Lords' Keep, the\nlast stronghold, is besieged by a massive\narmy of Foul's creations.\nWithout the seductions of beauty,\nCovenant summons all his anger, his last\ndefence, and sets out to personally destroy\nFoul. The final confrontation was, I felt,\nsomething of an anti-climax, yet was\nperfectly in keeping with Covenant's character.\nAt this point I must mention what to me was\nthe most powerful character in the book -Lord Mhoram. Initially described as 'a man\nwho looked as if he could surprise fate itself if\ndriven to his last' Mhoram bides his time until\nthe last book. It was Mhoram who, as the\nyoungest Lord, listened to and understood\nCovenant's reluctance to help. It was Mhoram\nagain, forty-seven years later as High Lord,\nwho discovered the reason the Lords were\nlosing the battle and unravelled the secret\nbehind Covenant's 'white gold'.\nAll in all this is a very powerful and sometimes deeply moving account of a struggle between the forces of good and evil.\nEach character has his/her strengths and\nweaknesses which are exploited to create\nacts of tremendous bravery or incredible\nstupidity. Donaldson describes the Land in a vivid fashion with more depth than Tolkien.\nCertainly the characters are more believable.\nThe use of symbols, a complex story-line,\ntrue-to-life characters and vivid narration of\nmomentous events make these books the\nmost interesting and enjoyable I 've ever read.\nI strongly recommend you all to go out and\nbuy them.\nJohn Harris\nThe ll l earth War\nThe second book begins with Covenant\nback home, having been released from\nhospital. After only a few days he is\nsummoned to the Land, where forty years\nhave passed since his last visit. Lord Foul has\nnow gained control of The ll l earth Stone and\nuses it to wage open war with a vast army.\nWe are introduced to Hile Troy, also\nsummoned from the 'real' world, who is a brilliant tactician and convinced he can gain a strategic advantage over Foul's armies and thus defeat them. The conflicting philosophies of Troy and Covenant are\nbrilliantly handled by Donaldson. The one\nbelieving passionately in the Land and doing\nhis utmost to defend it, the other doing his\nutmost to disbelieve it and yet only narrowly\nfailing to thwart Foul's plan. Again the story is\ncomplicated by the two mens' relationships\nwith High Lord Elena, their triumphs and their\nfailures.\n\n"

What do you mean we had no alternative!? That' s beside the point. The End is Nigh It's rather a funny feeling, sitting here, writing my last\nEditorial. After three years of chasing around after a degree this\nlast year has given me a chance to pause and take a good look at\nIC.I can't say I like the place, but many individuals have made it brighter by helping either FELIX or myself. I'll list them in the order in which they spring to mind. Thankyou; Malcolm Brain, Mary Attenborough, Mike Elk in, She y neL u cock, Paul Fairbairn, John Shuttleworth, Dave Haddon, Colin Palmer, Jill Dawson, Sonia Hoch f elder, Dave Crabbe, Paul Williams, Mark Smith, Jen, Pat and Annie in the Union Office, all those in IC Radio especially John Allen, everyone in Beit who helps collate, the Central Stores and College Block stall\nwho liven up my Friday morning and Julie and Fe from IF. Without the regular crowd in the tea room I would have given up long ago and without the many favours granted by Arthur Carter, Sue and Steve at AM International, FELIX would have\nnot appeared on more than one occasion. Anita Lai and Gill McCon way have put up with both var i type rs and phototypesetter s in typing FELIX and Iam deeply grateful to them both. Ian Morse has printed( almost) all ol my FELICE Sandon time: many thanks Ian. I'd like to wish those of you leaving IC the best of luck in the\nfuture and offer my' commiserations to those stuck here for\nanother year.\nAt least you' ll have JohnS. type FELICE S to read. The End is Here. NEWS IN BRIEF\nBEIT SAFETY\nCollege are at last to take action\nover the safety of women in Beit\nHall where the main door to the\nhostel cannot be locked.\nEstates section is to begin work\non strengthening the doors and providing good locks to prevent\nstrangers entering at night.\nDiscussions are to take place\nabout the possible provision of an\nanswerphone system for all Beit\nresidents.\nBEER RIP-OFF\nMalcolm Brain, piss artist\nextraordinary, has been appointed chairman of the Bar\nCommittee for next session. He takes over from Andy Middleton.\nA bar price survey by Andy Mid dlc ton has shown that IC bar\nprices are of the same order as\npubs elsewhere in South Kensington.\nHe told Council that this was a matter for concern as IC prices\nare the most expensive in the\nUniversity of London and are\nhigher than in pubs in many of the\nareas where students live.\nIt is College policy that IC bars\nshould be as profitable as possible.\nThe Union are to try to reverse\nthis policy which will probably\nrequire a Governing Body\ndecision.\nBLOOD GIVEN\nA total of 268 students gave\nblood over two days this term\nwhen the National Blood Transfusion Service visited the\nCollege.\nThe Service has sent a message\nof thanks to all volunteers.\nLast year 369 students gave\nblood over a period of three days.\nA barrel of beer awarded to the\ndepartment giving the most blood\nwent to Life Sciences but it has\nnot been claimed to date.\nWELFARE CENTRE USED\nAbout 3,000 visits were made to\nthe Union Welfare Centre this\nyear. The Union see this as\nconfirmation that the Centre is\nfulfilling a need not previously\nrecognised to exist by College,\nespecially as an accommodation\nservice.\nUNION MONEY CUT\nThe Union is to receive\n\u00a3\\26,525 from College in 1979/80.\nThis is a cut of ,\u00a37,500 on the\nestimate put in by the Union and\nhas meant that an overall 4 per\ncent cut has been forced on all\nexpenditure.\nUnion Finance Committee,\nmeeting last Friday, decided not\nto cut the grant to City and Guilds\nUnion as their original estimate\nhad been very low.\nDAY NURSERY\nDay nursery charges to\nstudents are to go up by \u00a31 per\nweek to \u00a316. Charges to staff will\nbe \u00a320.80, representing a6.7 per\ncent increase. The subsidy of\n\u00a35,000 for student places remains\nthe same as last year.\nChelsea College, which has five\nplaces in the nursery has been told\nto withdraw early in 1980 because\nthe nursery is becoming overcrowded. Chelsea College is\nhaving difficulties finding a building to house their nursery.\nUNION CARD\nNext year's Union card will\ninclude an advertisement by the\nNational Westminster Bank. The Union will receive \u00a3450.\nThe deal means that plans to\ninclude a list of useful telephone\nnumbers have been dropped.\nRADIO FIRST\nLast Sunday IC Radio broadcast what could be the first\nreal breakfast programme ever.\nAssistant Station Manager\nHarvey Nad in, who usually does\nthe Sunday morning slot, decided\nto celebrate the end of term by\npresenting the show live from his\nbedroom and providing a full\nbreakfast lor anyone who turned\nup.\nPeople began arriving soon\nalter the eight o 'clock start, coffee\nmugs in hand, and included the\nHall Warden, Frank Potter, and his wile, Union Deputy President\nMalcolm Brain, who smothered\nhis cornflakes in beer, and other\nstudents including Paul Fairbairn\nclad in pyjamas and a tie. Harveysoon found that he had barely-enough food to cope with demand\ndespite a shopping spree the day\nbefore.\nThe programme required a special two-way line, laid from\nHarvey's Keogh room to the\nstation control room in the\nSouthside basement where the\noperating was done.\nThe breakfast itself continued\nuntil well after the three-hour\nprogramme had ended, except for\nsome members of the station who\nhad to prepare the equipment lor\none of IC Radio's more usual\noutside broadcasts that evening,\nfrom Stan's Bar in Southside.\nRAG RECORD\nImperial College Rag has\nachieved a record collection this\nyear. Figures released this week\nshow that almost \u00a316,000- was\ncollected.\nThe previous record stood at\n\u00a39,000 and last year's total was\n\u00a37,500.\nBRAIN DAMAGE\nDeputy President Malcolm Brain estimates that the 2pV AT increase on a pint of beer\nannounced in the Budget on\nTuesday will cost him an extra\n\u00a320 per year.\n\n"
