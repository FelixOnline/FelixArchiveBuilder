FELIX FRIDAY DECEMBER 1 ST 1995 NEWS\nNews in brief\ncontinued from page one\nthe miners have just walked off\nwith the money.\nThe RSMU organisers have\ncomplained bitterly that Rag did\nnot clear the customers out of\nDa Vinci's before the event or\nprovide a cloakroom; both of\nwhich had customarily been part\nof Rag's responsibilities. But the\nacrimony between Rag and the\nRSMU goes back further, with\nPHOTO: DIANA HARRISON The door's open, but nobody's coming in. Interest in Rag has\nbeen fading.\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nCollege Examiners have decreed\nthat students will no longer be\nallowed to bring their own calculators in to external examinations, starting in the summer of\n1996. Instead, they will be\nissued with a standard depart-ment-approved model incorporating the basic scientific opera-t ions. The move to exclude students own calculators was taken\nearlier this month at a meeting of\nthe College Board of Examiners,\nwhere concern over the increasing sophistication of the\nmachines was discussed. In the\npast, the instructions to candidates sent to each student listed\na group of forbidden calculators,\nconsidered too powerful for the\nexams to be fair. Other calculators with memories or programs\nhad to have them wiped before\nentering the examination room.\nthe RSMU executive taking an\nincreasing dislike over the past\nfew years to Rag's methods for\nraising money, believing they\nlacked any ethos.\nRob Park, speaking for the\nRoyal College of Science Union,\nfelt that more publicity would\nnot have gone amiss. \"You need\npublicity all the time,\" he said.\n\"When I told some people about\nthe event [after it had hap-pen ed] they were interested like\nanything\".\nOn a happier note, Austin\nJones of the City and Guilds\nUnion said that they raised at\nleast \u00a3200 (the figure excludes\nsums collected by Rag members\nat the event). He added, though,\nthat a greater sum may have\nbeen collected if the sabbaticals\ntook part in the Slave Auction.\nThat is not to say, however, that\nthe Sabbaticals have not been\ngetting involved, as proved by\nSarah White, who was flan ned twice during the week by the Hit\nSquad.\nRag officials were unable to\ncomment on the total sum raised\nso far this year.\nNow, the Board of\nExaminers have said that it is\nunfeasible for in vigil at or s to be\nexpected to check that every calculator has been wiped, and having every student with the same\ncalculator will 'level the field'.\nDepartments around the college\nwere consulted on their preference for the standard machine,\nand three calculators have been\nshortlisted for further invest iga tion. These are the Casio fx82 super, Casio fx85 s and the Sharp\nEL 532gh. Vernon McClure, the\nAcademic Registrar, stressed\nthat there was no need for students to purchase any of these\nmachines, as some will be available for familiaris ation purposes\nnext term. He said that the\nexaminers decision would lead\nto \"parity of treatment\" and\nmaintain the \"integrity of the\nexamination.\"\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nAnother Hall Burglary\nOlave Hall, one of the college\nhalls on Knightsbridge, was visited by a burglar last Monday,\nprobably entering via a door that\nwas left propped open. The thief\nbroke into two rooms and stole\nover a hundred pounds of cash.\n...and Another\nLinstead - A man was seen leaving a room carrying a jar of tea.\nHe asked for some milk and left.\nA small sum of cash and a watch\nwere later reported missing by\nthe occupant. This follows the\narrest of another intruder in\nWeeks Hall on the 21st. Police sources advise people\nwho see someone suspicious\nshould try. and record their facial\nfeatures and actions and call\nsecurity.\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nA union official was told her\nrequest for information on IC\ndisciplinary proceed ure s 'caused\na great deal of amusement' this\nweek. Whilst researching for\nWelfare Week, Julia Knight,\nRCSU Welfare Rep, circulated a letter to Wardens for information concerning disciplinary procedure for offences in halls.\nProfessor Geoff New of\nFalmouth Keogh Hall gave the\nonly reply. He said that he\nassumed her request was not\nmeant to be taken seriously, but\nthat if it was she was under 'a total misapprehension about discipline in IC in general.'\nProfessor New's response\nwas considered by many students to be sarcastic and d is mis sive, though questions have been\nraised over whether or not Julia's approach was justified. Miss\nKnight said she \"was very di sap pointed\" by his reply, \"consider-ing the serious nature of my initial request.\" The House\nChairman at Bernard Sunley\n...and Last Week's The man who was arrested and\ncharged with attempted burglary\nin Weeks Hall last week is still in\ncustody. He is refusing to\nanswer any questions.\nHe was apprehended when\na student contacted Security\nafter she became suspicious of\nhis intent. He had barged into\nher room and claimed he was\nlooking for a toilet.\nIt is believed that the man\nmay be a part of a trio of thieves\ntargeting IC this year.\nDiscipline Problems\nA fourth year RSM student who\nkicked a hole in a plasterboard\nwall in the Concert Hall faced a Union Disciplinary earlier this\nweek. The Committee accepted\nhis story that he thought it was a solid brick wall and levied a \u00a320\nfine.\nHouse thought that \"it was an\ninsensitive reply... they [the war-dens] are there for student we l fare.. I wish the warden would\nre-examine his views, they\nshouldn't be put forward in such\na blunt manner.\"\nAlthough Prof New was\nunable for comment, there was\nlittle sympathy for Julia's letter\nfrom other quarters. College\ntutor Dr Gareth Jones, who\ndeals with welfare said that Miss\nKnight \"seems quite unaware of\nthe student disciplinary hand-continued on next page\nCalculator Ban in Exams\nWelfare Snubbed by Prof\n\n"

    "content": "simon baker Another week passes, which\nmeans Christmas is not that far\naway and, for some of us, exams\nare just round the corner. Tis -1 \\ * *\nthe season to be worried. ,\nHowever, in this uncertain\nworld, it's nice to see some\nthings don't change. I refer, of IPftfljf\ncourse, to the latest episode in\nthe Hnstead saga. After a session\nof the Spanish Inquisition, a res- fH ri Uf'' ident has been expelled, and the j fl Hfl k' shutters of f instead bar, which ^ > ; \u00bb ^ 4 ^\nseem to rise and fall quicker than\na whore's drawers, briefly closed yet again. There\nmust be something in the water this year,\nbecause it was never like that in my day.\nIt made a refreshing change to read in last\nweek's Felix some calm, objective articles on\nEcstasy, in very stark contrast to that scrawled in\nthe tabloids rec end y.E is no stranger to Imperial,\nmaking it a important subject for debate. The\narticles by Mark Baker (no relation!) and 'Iain\nBailie' (I did think the unthinkable for a minute)\nrightly put the scale of the 'problem' in perspective. This is not to condemn or to condone the\nuse of E, but merely express an opinion on the\nbasis of the facts as they are. Legalisation is\nalways going to be a tricky question, but one that\nshould be discussed rationally. The review of\n'Ecstasy and the Dance Culture', which I have\nread myself, captured the aim of the book per-fec dy, to present the facts, and enable the reader to arrive at an informed opinion. One wonders\nif any copies have reached the Wapping area.\nHowever, I would disagree with the notion that\nthose who are for and against E can be divided\non party lines. I know of very staunch supporters\nof the government at Imperial who are, through\npersonal experience, able to speak on this subject\nwith some authority.\nOne thing that I 've been meaning to do for a while is to attend the Bust-A Gut Comedy Club\nat the Union, so far to no avail. Nevertheless, this\nweek has not been without the odd laugh, albeit\nfrom an unexpected quarter.\nOn Wednesday, I found myself\nin east London, and decided to\ngo to the Student Funding\ndebate at Goldsmiths College,\nat which our dear friend\nGhassan Karrian was a speaker,\nalong with Ian Moss from the\nNUS and Hb Dem MP David\nRendel. The NUS call for grants\nat 1979 levels by putting 6.5p on income tax raised a smile,\nbut it was the questioning from\nthe floor that had me in stitches.\nThe first wasn'ta question, tak-:\ning on the form of a rant from\nsomeone who made Dennis Skinner look like\nMussolini. It rapidly emerged that she was a member of the SWP, who went on and on about\nthe evils of the Tories and suggested, nay\ndemanded, the abolition of Trident and the\nmonarchy, along with robbing the privatised utilities in order to pay colossal grants and every conceivable benefit to students. Another, from the\nCampaign for Free Education (?!), suggested\nthat students left university with debts of \u00a31520,000 (answers on a postcard as to how), and\ncriticised Ian Moss for selling out. When someone describes the policy that he supports as\n'broadly in agreement with Militant Students'\nonly to be told he's not radical enough, you know\nyou're in for a giggle. I never realised that anybody was, or could be, so left-wing and so\ndetached from reality. The wonderful irony of\nenabling more working class kids to get to university by taxing their working class parents into\noblivion seemed lost on them. I didn't ever think\nI would find myself most closely allied to\nGhassan in such a debate. Still not sure about\nhim, though.\nNice to see another lively article from our\nmen's cross-country team, but no news of the\ncaptain 'Swiss Cottage.' As for his mysterious\nsoubriquet, the only possible inferences are in\nconnection with a London district or an\nunspeakable act in a Genevan public toilet.

After a breezy first\nnight, some of us went to Portland for\nhard bolted climbs while the rest\nwent to Swanage for some more\nadventurous traditional climbing.\nAlthough some of us were complete\nbeginners this did not cause any\nproblems. The club had sufficient\nequipment to go round and the more\nexperienced members taught us what\nwe needed to know so that we were\nable to climb safely.\n518\nDuring the weekend we were\nable to do a lot of different climbs\nranging from exciting climbs through\nsea caves to strenuous climbs up sun\ndrenched limestone.\nSome people decided that the\nwater was just too tempting so they\nindulged in a spot of cliff jumping. As\nproof that students are not entirely\nmade of money the club president\nfinished the day's climbing with an\nafter dark a bse i ling epic merely to\nretrieve an item worth about two\npints.\nOn the whole, the weekend was\na great success for everyone and after\nthe following trip to the Peak\nDistrict, we're definitely going to be\nregulars from now on.\nNon-members are welcome to\npop along to the climbing wall, just\noff the Sherfield Walkway, to have a go.

FIVE\n0 nee tipo o3f i rne, Freixf] ot i clear fest ii) \u00a3...\n\"Nuclear testing.\"\nEvery time I hear these words, I remember\nhow uncomfortable it is sometimes to be a French citizen. People are very often\ntempted to associate your ideas as an\nindividual with your government's actions.\nResolved to keep a low profile, I wish to shed\nsome light on the current controversy\nregarding nuclear testing.\nFirstly, let's consider the scientist's arguments, as they do not pretend to carry\nout such experiments for the\nbenefit of debate. It seems\nthat for research's needs, this\ntesting will help to refine the\nexisting numerical model for\nthe explosion of nuclear\ndevices. Secondly, there is a safety concern involved. In\nfact, scientists argue that they\nneed to explode nuclear\ndevices to assess the effect\nthat long term storage has on\nthem. They have to make sure\nthat weapons will still be safe\nas they get older and older. Exploding\ntwenty year old devices might reveal\nmodifications that should be made to ensure\nsafety. This seems to be one motivation for\ncarrying out the tests. In parallel, the people\nin charge are zealous professionals\nperforming their tasks as well as their skills\nallow them to. As fundamental researchers\nthey will never accept they they are limited\nin their approach by anything other than\ntheir own intellectual facilities. All the same,\na researcher in genetics would not give trp his\nresearch on human gene alteration on the\ngrounds that it could produce a degenerate\ncreature. It's an intrinsic part of the\ndynamics of research to go beyond the limits.\nOn the other hand, these scientists\ndepend on their country which sponsors and\ncontrols them. That is mainly where the\npolitical interference in their work comes\nfrom. Away from the research centre in the\nPacific Ocean, the 'qualified' politicians in\nParis are meant to be making the appropriate\ndecisions. It looks like the recently elected\npresident, Mr Jaques Chirac, excels in the\nart of cultivating paradoxes. Regardless of his\ntroubles at home, his international\nengagements are enough to highlight these\ncontradictions. By pretending to favour the\ncompletion of the nuclear program, he tried\nto revive the tradition from the era when the\ntests were previously performed. At the\nsame time, he initiated and promised to sign\nthe international treaty of non-proliferation\nof nuclear weapons.\nSince Descartes, the French have been\nseen as rather logically minded, but for some\nreason, this time the transmission of the\ninheritance failed. In spite of the vehement\nprotests from people with the slightest\namount of common sense, a research matter\nhas become the guarantee of mon sier le\npresident's determination and independence.\nI am still wondering to what extent a government can impose its action against\ngeneral opposition before becoming\ndictatorial. Remember that Chirac won the\nelections with a small majority and that the\ngreater part of people in the country are\nopposed to his measures. This is especially\napparent where the future of nuclear\narmament is concerned.\nSo what shall we do? I am not sure\nwhether such an incautious boycott on the\nBeaujolais Nouveau, (as an advert in last\nweek's press proposed) is really a powerful\npersuasion tool. The problem is far beyond\nthat. The president must first realise that his\ninterest lies in a better international co-operation. Once his credibility is lost, any\nother involvement of the country in other\nfields will not be trustworthy. Economic\nconsequences particularly\nare far from negligible.\nConcerning the field of\nresearch, it seems rather\nchildish to aspire to a better modelling of\ndevices that are already\nsufficiently powerful to\nkill an entire population.\nIs it a matter of how deep\nthe radiation is going to\npenetrate their bodies?\nHow quickly a ninety-nine kilometre long city\ncan be destroyed? The population is not\ngoing to survive anyway.\nThe future orientation of research\nshould be towards improving safety and\nshould forget about improving existing\nweapons. I doubt the latter is absolutely\nnecessary for the security of the country,\nparticularly at a time when the expansion of\nworldwide communication should bring\nabout a better understanding between\ncountries. And if this doesn't happen, at least\na better knowledge of your opponents'\nmotivations can be used as a basis for\nmediation in a crisis.\nNow that things have been explained, I leave the last word to the French ambassador\nin Guatemala who said: \"Peace is a delicate\nmatter which ought not to be left in the\nhands of pacifists.\"\nSabine Louet\nSabine Louet is from Brittanny, and is at IC to do a MSc in Science Communication. With a bit of luck her offering will be the first of a semi-regular Foreign Objective, looking at international issues from the perspective of IC's overseas population. We would like to hear from\nany Nigerians out there, or perhaps there are a few Americans who could explain Newt Gingrich to the rest of us, or Irishmen with strong\nviews on divorce. And if there's anyone from ex-Yugoslavia, you've got a lot of explaining to do...\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY DECEMBER 1 ST 1995 SPORT\nFELIX SPORT\nRandom Soccer Matches\nLast Saturday RSM, despite\na 'donkey' keeper, managed an\neasy win over Goldsmiths III on\nSaturday, crushing them 6-1\naway from home. It was the previous week's result, though, that\ngrabbed the eye more.\nFor all true sports fans out\nthere, it was the upset of the sea-son. The Premier League leaders\nQMW were coming to face\nThird Division team RSM.\nThe scoring was opened,\nsurprisingly, by the RSM cap-tain, with his first for the club.\nHowever two soft goals in quick\nsuccession gave QMW the lead,\nbut IC fought back, and were\nImperial College Rugby finally\ngot itself sorted out when they\nrecorded a seven-nil victory\nagainst Wye College in the first\nround of the Gutteridge Cup.\nA superb first half display\nresulted in an opportunist try for\ncaptain Ian Oldham, which Kate\n(or is it Claudia) Mayes duly con-verte d. IC pressure after half\ntime saw Tom Salter stopped\njust short of the line after some\nslick back play.\nThe referee then seemed\nunduly keen to redress the bal-ance, awarding several dubious\npenalties against Imperial, with\nEric Cantona eventually taking\noffence. Imperial though, held\nfirm, and solid form from John\nEsser, Captain Oz and Chopper\nCrossman helped to record an\noutstanding victory, where\nImperial shone as a team and\nfully deserved their win.\nAnother men's rugby team\nwas also in action this week, the\nRoyal College of Science, (RCS)\nwho beat SOAS by 15-8. RCS\nwere absolutely bombarded in\nthe first ten minutes by powerful\nrewarded by an equalise r in the\nshape of Si's delicate chip over\nthe keeper. The second half saw\nQMW resurgent, yet IC coped\nwell with their continual pre s sure, until the 70th minute when\na quick break presented Hamish\nwith a simple finish. The last 20\nminutes saw QMW camped in\nIC's half. With only seconds\nremaining, a cross came into the\nbox to be met by the QMW captain who headed home only to\ndiscover the ref had blown for\nfull time.3-2!\nTheir most recent match\nthis Wednesday saw their sixth\nconsecutive win, with the prev i SOAS running, but after\nregrouping, Imperial's players\nshowed their superiority, with\ndominant forward play, swift\nhands in the backs and a few\n'howitzers' from stand-off Welsh\nGit.\nA 'well rehearsed' back\nmove then resulted in their new\nfullback Giles 'Ladies Man' Gale\ncrashing over under the posts.\nUnfortunately he was not quite\nso outstanding in the bar afterwards .\nWith the score 10-3 at the\nbreak, SOAS began to come back\ninto the game in the second half,\nbut a well worked forward effort\nfrom Captain Courageous himself allowed RCS to keep in\nfront.\nThe last ten minutes were\ntense, with a series of 'out-land ish' penalties forcing RCS\nback; SOAS, however, managed\nto knock-on as they were crossing the line to the relief by the\nscientists' entire team.\nThis win was the best way to\nget avenge their loss of four\nweeks ago.\nou sly underrated Simon scoring\nhis fourth goal in three games.\nAfter having all the play in the\nfirst half, and most of it in the\nsecond, the \"Donkey\" came\ngood and preserved his first\nclean sheet of the season to safeguard a10 win.\nAlso playing this Wednesday\nwere the RSM second team, who\nspent their afternoon scoring lots\ngoals and being denied many\nmore.\nTo say that the Royal Vet's goalkeeper was the man of the\nmatch after conceding seven\ngoals gives you some idea of the\nutter walkover RSM II enjoyed.\nINDOOR\nROWING?\nOn Sunday the 26th of\nNovember, members of IC\nBoat Club participated in the\nBritish Indoor Rowing\nChampionships, held this year\nin Reading. IC's main strength\nwas in the under-23 section,\ntraditionally a student event.\nIn the heats, IC finished\nwith six rowers in the the top\nten. The fastest time for the\n2500 metre race was set by our\nown Louis Attrill, finishing in\nan outstanding 5 mins 57 sees.\nThe U23 final included\nmany GB internationals and\ntop athletes from this year's Cambridge University Boat\nRace Squad. In the final, Louis\nAttrill finished first in 6.01,\nfour seconds ahead of\nSebastien Dawson-Bowling,\nCUBC's6'9\" monster.\nIn the open final, the\nGerman Ergo World\nChampion Matthias Siejorvski\nbeat Greg Searle of GB by four\nseconds, in a time of 5.46. That\nresult put Louis third overall in\nthe whole competition, beating\nmany top Senior Rowers!\nSpecky\nTwat Twats\nBeer\nMonster\nLike lambs to the slaughter we\ngot 'em and we got 'em good.\nTheir attack, defence and midfield fell apart. Unlucky!!!!\nHowever, our skills were\nsilky and the hockey of a Mrjet\ncharacter. All goals were, of\ncourse, Ferdinand-esque and the\nOxford reject scored a st unna( reverse stick flick from the top\nof the D, for those who are\ninterested). In their desperation\nthey resorted to violence:\nBeermonster was whacked by\nthe Specky Twat and was thus\ntransformed into \"Rhino\nWoman\". IC 7(Seven)-l UMDS\nHELL AT\nIMPERIAL\nSixteen of ICs finest took up the\nchallenge to become the\nCollege's Doom 2(the classic\nPC shoot 'em up) champion.\nThe quarter finals went with\nseeding, leaving only 6 com pet i tors. The semi-finals were a complete shock with the 2 highest seeds being knocked out,\nthough David Ruescas had\nadmittedly set his configuration\nwrong. The final between\nP. Blakerman and C. Marston was\none sided with Marston winning\nby a resounding 26 kills (or\nfrag s) to 13.\nSport? Hmm.\nTENNIS\nELBOWED\nIC Tennis II headed up to\nSherburn, Yorkshire confident\nthat their sublime talent would\ncarry them to success. In the\nevent, things did not quite go to\nplan, with IC beaten 71-37, but\nit was at least a good effort. In\nsummary: \"We were miles bet-ter, and they had all the luck.\"\nHmm.\nRugby Teams Sort It Out\n\n"

The Union now has a legal\nadvice scheme operating on\nWednesday evenings between\n5 and 6pm. The visiting\nsolicitors are specialists in\neither housing or im migr a tion. The service is available\nto students and staff. Those\nwho are eligible for legal aid\n(on grounds of low income)\nwill be asked to sign a legal\naid green form. If you are not\neligible for legal aid you will\nstill be given free advice.\nAny subsequent legal work\nrequired will not be provided\nfree unless you qualify for\nlegal aid.\nThe session operates on a 'first-come, first served'\nbasis. You are recommended\nto check in before 5pm as\nonly a limited number of people can be seen. If you want\nto find out who is attending in\na specific week or require further details, please contact the\nUnion Adviser.\nRecent tragedies concerning\nec stacy, the \"love drug\" have\nproved it to be potentially as\nlethal as any other. Many\nknown problems stem from\nimpurities (and even poisons)\nbeing mixed with the pure\ndrug in order to save money\nfor the supplier. Added to this\nare risks of overheating\nINTERNATIONAL\nSTUDENTS & COUNCIL\nTAX\nInternational students are\nreminded that if they are currently paying 75% council tax\nbecause their non-British\nspouse has joined them, they\nmay be eligible for full\nexemption following a change in the regulations\nrecently. If a non-EEA\nspouse is either prohibited\nfrom working or forbidden to\nclaim public funds, then the\nexe m tion may apply. Contact\nthe Union Adviser for further\ndetails.\nSTUDENTS &\nCOUNCIL TAX\nStudents who share ac como dati on with non-students may\nfind themselves jointly and\nseverally liable for council\ntax. For example, 3 students\nliving with 1 non-student\nwould each be responsible for\ncaused by dehydration and\nother adverse reactions to taking the drug, the causes of\nwhich are not yet fully under-stood. Taken over the longer\nterm, it is thought that it may\nlead to psychological dependance and possible physical\nand neurological damage.\nmaking sure that someone\npays 75% of the full bill.\nThey Would get a25% discount as only one non-exempted person lives there.\nAlso, students living in particular types of housing may\nalso have to pay council tax\nvia their rent (as the landlord\nwill be charged directly).\nAnyone moving into different\nac como dati on should find out\nwhat their council tax\nsituation is before they do so.\nINTERNATIONAL\nSTUDENTS & CHILD\nBENEFIT\nInternational students with\nchildren are reminded that\nthey can and should claim\nchild benefit and help with\nNHS charges. Child benefit is\nnot regarded as 'recourse to\npublic funds'.\nEcstacy is a class A drug so\nmanufacture, possession and\nsupply is illegal. It is also\nillegal to drive under\nits influence. Anyone needing\nadvice or counselling on any\ndrug-related matter should\ncontact Release on 0171 603\n8654.\n6CST RSV...?

    "content": "TWENTY FOUR. FELIX FRIDAY DECEMBER 1 ST 1 995 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix:\nEDITED BY JEREMY TI IOMSON\nIn a Scrape Dear Felix,\nAt the last Council meeting it\nwas decided that \u00a3300 (a reduction from \u00a3487.03) should be\npaid by myself and the Sailing\nClub for the repair of several\npaintwork scratches on one of the\nnewer minibuses. As the driver at\nthe time of the accident, the\nUnion insurance policy makes me\nliable for an excess payment of\n\u00a3500 on any damage done to the\nbus whilst I am responsible for it.\n(Incidentally, this includes damage by a third party).\nFirstly, the Union staff have\nhandled the matter badly in every,\nrespect. The incident occurred in\nJune. My driver's card has been\non hold ever since. It has taken 5\nmonths (and several meetings) so\nfar to reach this conclusion which\nI am greatly unhappy with.\nSecondly, the amount I was\ninitially expected to pay was not\ngreatly different from the \u00a3500 I would be charged if I had written\noff the bus! The point I was trying to make at the Council was\nthat, although I accept to pay a reasonable excess on damage , I feel that my signature on the bottom of that insurance policy was\ntaken to mean \"IOU \u00a3500\". No\neffort at all was made to keep\nrepair costs down on my behalf.\nI hope that the Union Staff\nhave learnt a lesson from this one\nand make the effort to clear up\nfuture incidents quickly and pro-fess ion ally. Regarding the Union's insurance policy, it seems obvious that\nsomething should be done to protect Union drivers against the\nexcess. I urge other concerned\ndrivers to put pressure on the\nUnion to make it more sympathetic to those of us that make\nclub trips possible. Don't wait\nuntil it stings you'\nSarah Wingrove\nMech Eng TV\nI had no idea that drivers were\npersonally liable for accidents,\nespecially third party. Call me a optimist, but I thought that was\nwhat insurance policies were for.\n\u00a3487 to repair some scratches?\nThey could buy new panels for\nthat. They probably did.\nM usos Nabbed Whilst relaxing in the tranquillity\nof Da Vinci's last Friday evening,\nin the midst of the usual collection\nof student and non-popstar types,\nit came to our attention that there\nwas an intruder among us. The\nintruder of which we speak is not\none of the usual brigade of doormat thieves or hockey players, but\ninstead one of the star spangled\npop crowd, who for some reason\nhad chosen to grace our hallowed\nhalls. The one and only Jake.\nShillingford, of 'My Life Story'\nfame, was downing a merry bev vy of the Union's best.\nAt first we thought an\nimpromptu gig was the order of\nthe day, only to remember that\nthe fluffy bunnies had already\nplayed their last gig of the year a week earlier at the LA2. A gig that\nwe would like to point out was\nc huffing ace.\nWe would be very grateful if\nthe powers that be could inform\nthe world whether or not this is\ngoing to be the start of an amazing\ntrend of pop ster s popping in for a pint on a Friday night or just\nMark's mate making a merry one-off.\nWith love,\nlake and Mark\nCould be. Not only have 'My\nLife Story' been seen struggling\nthrough sturdy swathes of\nshouting sportsmen, but the\nunique Henry Kelly recently\nreclined among the rancid rev-eller's refuse in the reputable Da\nVinci's Bar.\nSo I'm told.\nCurry Sc Fags Dear Felix,\nPerhaps it is that the\nBlackett Smokers Lobby have\nrelocated, or maybe mid-term\nstresses have become too much,\nbut I feel that I have been roused\nto pop forth my two-penne th into the smoke pit. It seems that\nin the JCR it has become a new\nand funky to display ignorance\nand disrespect; you can practically see the two dimensional\nthought bubbles reading \"Bog off,\nif I want a fag I 'll 'ave one\" float\nfrom one end of the room to the\nother. The unfortunate no smoking signs peep dejectedly from\nbehind last week's posters, hoping beyond hope that someone\nmight take notice of them.\nThe final blow occurred\nwhilst queueing for a vegetable\nbargain at the curry bar. Ahead of\nme in the queue stood a slovenly,\nthough not unattractive youth.\nHe purchased his box in a manner apparently ignorant of common etiquette, the reason, I charitably suggest was the Lambert &\nButler King Size gently nestled\nlike a new born puppy (beagle,\nprobably) into the damp corner\nof his mouth. The ash had\nreached formidable proportions\nand threatened to free itself from\nthe glowing butt to parachute\ndelicately into the serving trolley\nbelow. If it had not been for my\ndesperate appetite I fear I may\nhave passed out.\nThe point to this IS , though\nthe JCR is designated a no smoking area there are a growing number of people who smoke regard-less. An impromptu head count revealed that all these people\ncould quite happily fit into the\narea between the JCR and the\nSenior Dining Area. However, as\nit seems smokers prefer, quite\nrightly, to smoke their own\nsmoke, they prefer to further\ntheir hobby in places where the\nair is clean. But as Dr Bot so virtuously says, they can just bog off\nand smoke in the smoking area -which has a splendid view of QT.\nWhat is to be done? Will the\nUnion take it in its stride or will\nthe Dr and I have to speak tersely to those reprobates involved?\nCaptain Spooner &d Dr Bot\nWell there, steady as you go\nchaps, not to cast any aspersions\nor such like about your persons,\nbut pertaining to your an humorous pseudo no mic suggestion\n(suspicious alliterative?) should\nit not read, so to say, 'Dr\nSpooner', the stable mate of the\nesteemed Mrs Malaprop, or is\nthis this a case of 'no relation'\neh? I think we should be told,\nramble, etc.\nAnd Now... My response to C Unwin's letter\nlast week regarding student\ngrants:\nOur major competitors ask students to pay in full their living\nexpenses in addition to their fees.\nI must emphasise again that it is\nthe people in the street; the post-man; the brick layers; the cleaners that are helping to pay for our\neducation. Never forget that we\nwill become the high earners of\ntomorrow- we have a responsibility to taxpayers, and let's not lose\nsight of that for one moment.\nGeoff Boon\nVice Chairman of ConSoc\nWhat utter twaddle. 'Major\ncompetitors' do not all expect\nstudents to pay their own way. If\nthey did, wouldn't that ensure\nthat university remained elitist\nand exclusive? Also, I do not\nhave a responsibility to any 'tax\npayer', except myself and possibly my dad. It is the government\nthat takes the taxpayers' money\nthat is responsible for seeing it\nused wisely. I hardly think the\ntaxpayer would accuse the government of wastefully squandering money on education.\nGrants are not gifts but\ninvestments. If the government\nwants to see able people excel,\nthen they must allow them the\nmeans to do so. The alternative\nis the age old idiocy of educating\nthe affluent and having a country run by sheltered out-of-touch\nrich fools. Ring any bells?\n\n"

    "content": "HOUSING MATTERS\nMany enquiries have come\ninto the advice office concerning housing matters.\nSome of the questions most\ncommonly asked are set out\nbelow. The Union produced\n\"Housing Rights Guide\"\nshould be available again\nfrom reception very soon.\nQ. My landlord keeps calling\nround and letting himself in to\nmake sure I haven't destroyed\nhis flat. He lives across the\nroad and this is annoying me.\nWhat can I do?\nA. Your landlord is harrassing\nyou and this is a criminal\noffence. An implied clause in\nany tenancy agreement is that\none is entitled to \"quiet enjoy-ment\" of the property. Try\ntalking to your landlord and if that fails, your local tenancy\nrelations officer should be\nable to intervene. Failing that\nyou could take legal a dy ice. Q.I signed a tenancy agreement for a year but I'd like to\nmove in with some friends.\nMy landlord says she will bill\nme for the whole of the peri-od. Is this allowed?\nA. A fixed term contract is\nsupposed to give both parties\na degree of security. Your\nlandlady could sue for rent\nshe loses but would have to\nshow that she has tried to mitigate her losses by re-letting\nyour ac como dati on first.\nAlways try and be sure you\nwant to live somewhere\nbefore you sign an agreement.\nQ. My landlord says I have to\npay him extra if I have any\nfriends staying over in my\nflat. I have an assured short-hold tenancy and this isn't in\nmy agreement. Is it fair?\nA. Your landlord may be\nconcerned that you are going\nto 'sub-let' to other people\n(i.e. charge someone for\nsleeping on your sofa etc).\nHowever, he cannot charge\nyou for having friends stay\nover unless it was part of your\ninitial agreement. Even if he\nwas certain that you were\nsub-letting would have to take\nlegal steps to end the tenancy.\nQ. There is a leaking pipe in\nmy kitchen which has led to\nmould and slugs appearing.\nMy landlord does not seem\nkeen to fix it. What can I do?\nA. Contact your local environmental health office and\nask them to inspect the prop-er ty. They can serve a notice\nforcing the landlord to carry\nout repairs.\nAll enquiries are dealt with in\nstrict confidence. The above\nscenarios may be familiar to\nsome but their inclusion does\nnot refer to specific cases.\nA WIDE &ANGE'\nli iiii Spl i^pl ll ill ll UNION.\nTHE MONEY PROBLEM\nGraduating without amassing\nlarge amounts of debt is virtually impossible, particularly\nfor London Students.\nGiven that rent alone is likely\nto eat up your entire student\ngrant (if you get one), it is\nimportant to budget your\nexpenditure over the year.\nSetting aside part of your\ntermly income to cover the\nessentials (boring things like\nrent, food, travel, gas etc.)\nwill give you a better idea of\nwhat you can and can't afford\nto buy.\nIf you have to take out a student loan (and are eli gi ble), take it in termly install-ment s. While the College\nwould not wish to encourage\nstudents to borrow from any-where, realistically, student\nloans are (apart from free\noverdrafts) the most sensible\nway to borrow. The interest\nrates are low and should you\nfail to be employed at the end\nof your course, you can defer\nrepayment.\nAlso, it is crucial to keep your\nbank informed if you are having financial difficulty. Banks\ntend to get upset when students take it for granted that\nspend beyond their limits\nwithout permission. This can\nlead to painful bank charges\nand withdrawal of some services (such as switch cards).\nIt is basically a question of\ngood manners and you should\nnot feel like you are \"beg-g ing\" your bank for mercy.\nThey are there to help you\n(and to subsequently make\nmoney of course).\nCredit cards are to be avoided\nat all costs and if you are currently propping up a credit\ncard debt or any other loan\nyou should consult the Union\nadviser on how to go about\nreducing the repayments if you find yourself in dire hard-ship. With a little reasonable\nnegotiation it is sometimes\npossible to suspend interest\npayments as well (although\nyou will have to pay the debt\noff at some point).\nPost-graduate and overseas\nstudents face equally hard\ntimes and often receive little\nor no help with their funding.\nThere is some financial help\navailable from the college in\nthe shape of the access and\nhardship funds and externally\nthere are trusts and grant\nmaking bodies who distribute\nmonies to specific target\ngroups. Any students experiencing financial difficulties\nshould contact the Union\nAdviser for further in form a tion. Managing what you\nhave might still not see you\nthrough to the end of your\ncourse without extra help but\nit will certainly make a big\ndifference.\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY DECEMBER 1 ST 1995 NEWS\nCool Telescope Blasts Off\nGuilds Union Hits\n\"Unprecedented\" Low\nBY DIPAK G HO SH Recent elections for City &\nGuilds College Union's three\nremaining posts on their executive committee were marred by\nthe low turnout of voters. The\nlack of interest in the three posts\non offer, Honorary Secretary,\nEntertainments Officer and\nPublicity Officer, has been\nblamed on poor publicity.\nThe posts should have been\nfilled at the last election in\nFebruary but no candidates came\nforward at the time.

The\nFestival normally returns a healthy amount for Rag's chari-ties, but has fallen victim to the\ndearth in interest that has blighted Rag's efforts this year.\nThe Beer Festival itself\ncaused irritation for College and\nUnion alike as neither College\nCatering, Estates, nor any of the\ncollege licensees said they were\nconsulted about the event.\nFurther, a senior Rag source said\nthat Simon Cooper, the organ is er, was warned that a loss was\nvery likely this year, as the event\nhad been running into diff i cul ties. The RCSU have agreed to\nrun several events to try and\nmake up for the very significant\nlosses, with astonishing reports\nthat over half the beer was not\ntouched.\nThe other events of Rag\nWeek have also been hit by low\nattendances. The Guilds Slave\nAuction could barely count more\nthan its organisers and potential\nslaves as being present in the\nUCH last thursday.

The idea is\nnot just to promote prevent it ive practices such as safe sex\nbut to demonstrate support\nand concern for people infected with HIV and AIDS and to\neducate people in order to\nfight prejudice.\nThe red ribbon is the international symbol of aids aware-ness, and was first worn in\nBritain in November 1991 by\n70,000 fans at the Freddie\nMercury Memorial concert at\nWembley Stadium.

    "content": "Sophisticated machines have become\ncommonplace in hospitals. They\nmonitor patients, perform imaging\nand treat cancer. But imagine if you\nwere told the operation you were\nabout to undergo will not be performed by a human surgeon, but by a robot.\nPicture the scene. You are wheeled in under a general anaesthetic and connected to the appropriate equipment by a team of surgeons. Then a robot inserts a probe into your body and soon\nafterwards, visual and ultrasound images appear\non a monitor. The surgeons in s tandy see the\nproblem and mark on the screen the areas which\nneed attention. Next, the robot is instructed,\nstep by step, to make a series of incisions using\nits cutting tool. Thirty minutes later, the operation is complete and when you wake up you will\nhave undergone surgery which is safer, faster,\nand will take you less time to recover from. No,\nthis isn'ta wild vision of the future but a reality\nmade possible by developments in robot technology at Imperial's mechanical engineering\ndepartment.\nDr Brian Davies and Dr Roger Hibbert have\ndeveloped a robot which is capable of performing prostrate surgery by itself. So far several operations have been carried out at Guy's Hospital in\nLondon - this the first time a robot has been\nused for surgery in this way. Dr Davies, who has\npreviously worked with robots in manufacturing\nand powered prosthetics such as artificial arms,\ngot the idea for the system when he was\napproached by the Institute of Urology in 1988.\nProstate surgery is a difficult, messy business.\nIt requires lengthy tai ning and involves (cross\nyour legs gents) surgeons inserting an endoscope\nand a hot wire cutting tool into the urethra. The\nsurgeon must look down the endoscope from an\nuncomfortable angle and cut away a section of\nthe prostrate gland whilst urine, blood and gore\nruns down his armpits. Another problem is that\nsurgeons tend to 'get lost' within the body during the operation and need to retract the endoscope so they can get their bearings.\nDr Davies saw prostrate surgery as an ideal\nTelesurgery Soap Opera\nCould robot surgeons replace human surgeons\nin the future? One popular idea is long distance\ntele surgery in which the patient is operated on\nby a robot under the supervision of a surgeon\nwho could be in a different country. Dr Davies'\nopinion is that this would be undesirable, \"You\nneed to have the skill and judgement of a surgeon involved in the procedure at all times, surgeons must take responsibility for the operation\"\nHe pointed out that if anything went wrong\nwith a robot operation, who would be resp on si ble? \"There must be accepted levels of liability.\"\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n>in\nRobots at the Cutting Edge\nof Surgery\nA Robot from Imperial has recently been allowed into the\noperating theatre. Ben Wilkins finds out what it can do\nLook no hands! Surgeons at Guy's Hospital stand back and watch the 'Probot' do its stuff.\nxm\napplication for robots because they are very good\nat not losing their way, they are accurate and can\nperform many repetitive cutting motions. \"It\nseemed like an ideal area to start with\" he said.\nHowever, an initial feasibility study showed\nwhile robotic prostrate surgery was possible, it\nwas difficult to perform safely. The cutting must\nbe accurate, 'otherwise, you'll make make someone a wetter' as he put it.\nAfter a struggle to gain funds for the project,\nDr Davies and his colleagues were eventually\nable to overcome this problem and develop a system which was able to operate safely. The\n'p robot'( prostrate robot) is mounted on a counterbalanced gantry and uses a motor gearbox\nencoder to manipulate the endoscope probe.\nWhen the endoscope is first inserted into the\npatient's urethra, an ultrasound probe scans in\n5mm sections and builds up a3 dimensional\nimage of the prostrate. This image is used as a basis for the cutting program.\nNext the cutting tool, called the 'vapour-t rode' is fitted into the endoscope. The vapour-t rode is essentially a little roller with teeth on\nwhich vapour is es the tissue and causes less\nbleeding. The robot's ingenious mounting system only allows it to safely remove small conical\nsections of the prostrate. But before cutting\nbegins, the surgeon uses a light pen to mark the\narea on the ultrasound image which needs to be\nremoved. He can then watch the operation\nprogress via a monitor linked to a camera system\nin the endoscope. \"The surgeon is always in the\nloop during surgery\" explained Dr Davies, \"he\nbuild up an idea of what is safe to re sect as he\ntells the robot to remove successive sections.\"\nThe operation can be done faster and more accurately by the p robot and is much less labour\nintensive for the surgeons. The research team are\ncurrent iy making further refinements to the\nimaging system.\nDr Davies has also developed a robotic system\nfor performing total knee replacement surgery.\nTraditionally, the surgeon has to manually cut the\nknee bone surfaces to the exact shape of the new\nprosthesis. Accuracy and alignment are crucial.\nThe robotic system uses \"force control\" which\ncreates an artificial restriction on where the surgeon can move the cutter. For instance, if a surgeon has to cut a groove in the bone it will only\nlet him cut wit fr in that groove. If the cutter starts\nto stray away from the 3-dimensional region designated by the robot program, the surgeon will\nfeel a resistance force. This allows him to cut the\nbone faster and more accurately with less blood\nloss. It also means that means a more predictable\nresult, so fewer revisions are necessary. Dr\nDavies believes this kind of surgery will also be\napplicable to other areas such as brain surgery,\near surgery and kidney stone removal.\n\n"

    "content": "gig/in te mew: built to spill\n+ foo fighters vi k We're sitting in some far from salubrious surroundings in Brixton Academy. Built to Spill's dressing room adds a new dimension to the\nphrase, 'Back to basics'. No chairs, tables or heating here. Just a floor and a cooler box with some\nbottles of beer and water.\nNot that this seems to phase Built to Spill.\nYou see, they are not your typical band. They're\njust four ordinary guys who make music and have\nstumbled upon a worldwide tour supporting a major band. They're not even too bothered about\nthat. Guitarist, vocalist and band mainstay, Doug\nMartsch articulated his lack of enthusiasm:\n\"Sometimes we like being on tour but it's a bit boring because we're playing the same songs\nevery day. I'm actually looking forward to leaving.\"\nA major contributing factor to this seemingly\nblas e attitude is the fact that Doug has his girlfriend and an eighteen month old baby. He is a lot more exuberant about that part of his life.\n\"My son totally changed my life. My girlfriend and I chase him round the house all day!\nHe's really into our music. For some reason, he\nonly wants to hear our CD and gets upset if anyone changes the music. I think that my girlfriend\nis a bit p*** ed off with the album now.\"\nThe album in question is 'There's Nothing\nWrong With Love'. With its cellos, distinctly non-aggressive stance and progressive musical meandering you wouldn't think that it would be a fetish\nfor Foo Fighters' fans (alliteration, anyone?).\nPredictably, this does not seem to bother them\neither, as cellist John Mahon explained:\n\"We just hope that people are willing to lis-ten. Too many people go to shows for the wrong\nreasons. If they go with a spirit of discovery then\nthat's okay but if they just go to get angry then...\"\nLater that evening, Built to Spill take to the\nAcademy stage and deliver a set that's low on\nincident but high on accomplished playing. Doug\nis obviously a seasoned veteran in handling hostile\ncrowds (although this crowd is persistent in its\npolite applause) and responds to shouts for Foo\nFighters with, \"No, sorry. We are Built to Spill.\nThat's Built (pause) to (pause) Spill.\"\nThe band leave with a parting shot to the\ncrowd of, \"You've been something else.\" Who\nsaid Americans have no sense of irony?\nThanks to the inter-band songs on the PA, I didn't have to think too hard for a written link\nbetween Built to Spill and Foo Fighters. Gloria\nGaynor's'I Will Survive' sums up Dave Grohl's transition from Nirvana drummer to guitar-wield-ing frontman of the Nirvana legacy perfectly.\nThe eponymous debut album is packed to\nthe brim with uplifting songs that sound like\nGrohl is just glad to be alive after all the emotional turmoil of the last eighteen months. Tonight\nthey are played with a reckless punk abandon that\ngives the anticipation-frenzied crowd the good,\nclean fun that they have been salivating for.\nThe biggest cheers are saved for the first two\nsingles, 'This Is A Call' and 'I 'll Stick Around', but\nthe whole set, from the dreamy 'Floaty' through\nto the charging Good Grief (which Grohl otters\nto play \"The Pixies way or the Def Leppard way\"\nand un surprisingly is coerced into choosing the\nformer option), is an enthralling, energetic ride.\n'I Will Survive' may summarise Grohl's progress to date but Til Stick Around' is more\nthan an appropriate signature tune for him and\nthe band from now on.\ngig: moon dog JT. mr. trout\nStef Kami! Carlens is better known as the driving\nforce behind dEUS, but it is with Moondog Jr.\nthat his creative brilliance shines through.\nMoondog Jr. are simply incredible. On first hear-ing, they can be best described as a bizarre mix of Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Tom\nWaits, Rage Against the Machine,\nMadness, and a hefty dollop of free form\njazz. On record they are weird, but\nstrangely engaging. Live, they are breath-taking.\nIn the normally reserved and super\ncool atmosphere of the Camden Jazz\nCafe, their deliberately understated start\nsomehow managed to enthrall everyone present.\nFrom the frightening solo blues songs to the near\nmosh frenzy of the funkier numbers, the person-singles\nness. Both are unoriginal.\nLook out tor this band. This\ninfectious, '80s guitar based\nwhirl is a sure sign of great A jay/, influenced riff under a encountered - buy the live\nali ties( and drug preferences) of each band member presented themseves in an intoxicating ly subtle way.\nStef, though, was the man r anning the show,\nand he managed to blend raw sulphate energy\nwith a near vulgar display of sincere emo-tion, in a way not seen since Cobain. He\neven carried off a truly brilliant cover of\n\"Jackie\" (you know, the one where the\nguy wants to be for only an hour, just an\nhour every day, if he could be for just one\nlittle hour, cool, in a stupid-ass way),\nsomething which demonstrated the\nextreme diversity of the band.\nGoing home, I couldn't help t fr in king I'd discovered a whole new world. Moondog Jr. will\nnever be on Top of the Pops, but this is no reason\nto ignore their obvious talent.\nPsychedelic Fur\ndoesn't live up t< Starts all Sn\nlike with lu\nli ill ll lii A A AAB:; \u2022-.\"AA'A; "

My legs ache from\ntheir climb up to this place, home to shepherds\nwho are sole summer guardians of the livestock\nfrom many villages. Now though, the sun is\nbeginning to set, and the goats on the pasture\nare being herded back to their pen next door,\nbleating madly as though chased by some o vine nightmare. The shepherd's son comes through\ndoor grinning, his lace less Adidas trainers\ncontrasting with his shalwar q am eez and\npullover. He is soon followed by the shepherd\nhimself who has been giving the goats their last\nmilking of the day.\nHis daily chores discharged, he turns\nhis attention to his guests, putting a kettle on\nthe fire and offering some tea. For a meal, we\nsupplement his homemade ph it ti bread with\ntinned meats and cheeses of our own. Not\nquite a cultural exchange though, as cans of\nHeinz beans seem to have made the long\njourney to some of the local markets, albeit to\nserve the foreign trade.\nLater, after some incredibly sweet tea\ndrunk whilst reclining across their blanket\ncovered floor, the old man talks to us,\nalternating Burushaski with halting Urdu. I am\naware of the fire glowing red ly to one side,\ncompleting the circle of our group and\nilluminating his face so that it stands out from\nthe darkly re cee ding hut. This scene seems\nsomehow removed from everything else, as our\ncultures meet in a fragile hut on the side of a mountain pasture in the midst of some of the\nhighest peaks in the world.\nAs an opening gambit, the shepherd\ndeclares that he is still strong enough to knock\nme on my head, even though he is three times\nmy age. Thus satisfied that he has asserted\nhimself, he goes on to relate his part in the war\nHimalayas\nThe green and fertile pasture was quite an arresting sight 4000m up in the Karakoram mountains,\nespecially after an exhausting eight hour climb\nthrough remorselessly barren s cree and boulder.\nThe name Karakoram means 'black rock', and\nlends itself well to describing the land around the\nHunza valley, a tiny strip of life clinging to a river,\ndeep within northern Pakistan.\nagainst India, becoming quite animated with\nthe stories of his behind-the-lines action. But\nnow this erstwhile soldier says that he likes to\nget away up here during the summer, as he\nfinds it too hot in the valley, and there are too\nmany tourists. During the winter months,\nhowever, he looks after one of the many micro\nhydro-electric plants that have sprung all along\nthe valley with development aid.\nThis revelation was shortly followed\nby a request for some medicine for his head, in\nwhich he had a constant pain. Assuring him\nthat we would send some up with his next\nsupply of foods, the evening moved on to sleep,\nour own heads befuddled by the heavy\nwood smoke trapped in the low hut until it\ncould escape through the\nroof. Up on the roof, I fell\nasleep quickly, only to\nreawaken a few hours later\nshivering and wishing that I brought more clothes up\nwith me. Unable to sleep, I lay staring at the incredibly\nbright Milky Way until the\ndawn chased it away,\nconscious that it was\nsomething I had never\nreally seen properly before.\nAlex Feakes\ns fi i&r WAy.

Despite the\ndifficulties however, it is hoped\nthat they will be able to have \"a skeleton-type service running.\"\nthe task for which she had vol-un tee red. Miss White added that\nshe had received letters of\nenquiry from some of the hall\nwardens who had been contacted by the Welfare Rep, expressing surprise at the fact that this\napproach was being used given\nthat such information was freely\navailable.\nMiss White maintained that\nJulia should really have been\nexamining topics like student\nhousing rights and similar subjects under the banner of \"Legal\nMatters\", rather than bringing\ncollege disciplinary procedures\nunder scrutiny. \"I'm not amused\nby it... it was a waste of people's time.\" As for the attitude of Prof\nNew, she said \"It's just his way,\nhe's just like that... college staff\nare tactless sometimes.\"\nHowever, this still leaves\nopen the issue of what many\nconsider to be the unnecessary\nsarcasm and rudeness on the part\nof a hall warden and college pro-fess or.\"I think it typifies the\nwardens' views of students\" said\nPub board Chair Piers Williams,\n\"it isn't very responsible to say\nthings like this.\"\nBY BEN WILKINS\nIn his column in The Times\nlast week, Matthew Parris highlighted the difficulties faced by\nhomosexuals at IC because its\nstudents, mainly studying sci-en ce, were more prejudiced than\nat other universities.\nParris, the first MP to come\nout as gay in a speech to the\nHouse of Commons, recently\nvisited the college to talk to\nImperial Queers, IC's society for\ngay men, lesbians and bisexuals.\nMembers of IQ complained to\nhim that their group felt it was\n\"quite a struggle to be open\nabout their sexuality at this col-leg e\". Their members say they\nsuffer from a lack of respect and\neven arrogance from their fellow\nstudents. On several occasions in\nthe past when they have put up\nposters around college, they have\nbeen torn down. IQ members\nenvy the \"openness of the ethos\nin colleges where not all the students are studying science\".\nIn his column, Parris reflected on the fact that scientists on\nthe whole seem \"disproportion-at ely timid and deferential to\nconventional wisdom\". Scientists, he says, are often perceived\nto be rational, objective and free\nthinking, belonging to the discipline most likely to challenge\nauthority and religion. But he\nsuggested that in reality, scientific thinking encourages a \"narrow\nand focussed adherence to one\nline of study\". He believes it fosters narrow mindedness and reinforces ideas about the inferiority\nof groups including women, the\nmentally ill and homosexuals.\nHis remarks were criticised\nby Sir Walter Bodmer, who has\nproduced an influential report on\nthe public understanding of sci-en ce. When he visited Imperial\nlast week, he commented,\n\"clearly we still have a long way\nto go\". The president of Imperial\nQueers, Ashley Lumsden, also\ndisagreed with his reasons for\nthe prejudice at IC, he said, \"I think because its a science col-leg e, there are are large numbers\nof men social ising with other\nmen. This situation creates a 'macho' atmosphere which does\nnot lead to much tolerance\".\n\n"

With Catharine taking over\nthe captaincy, things went\ndownhill after conceding two\nsoft tries on the wing due to an\nabsence of three-quarter tack-ling.\nThis aspect of the game is\nmost disappointing given the\nefforts of the forwards, part icu PHOTO: WILLIAM tORE NZ la rly in the line out which was\nonce again exemplary.

I did not say\nthat ConSoc 'disclaimed' the\nviews of its chairman, only that\nhis views were not necessarily\nthose of ConSoc and more\nimportantly the views of the\nConservative Party (look in your\nglossary of journalistic terms,\nthis is not the definition of a dis-claim er, which of course has\nwider legal implications). In\neffect he was expressing his personal views and not acting in his\ncapacity of ConSoc chairman, as\nwhich I believe he still has the\nstrong support of ConSoc mem-be rs, including myself, to cont in ue. He should not, I believe have\ntherefore signed himself as the\nConSoc chairman on the letter in\nthe same way that MPs and ministers when writing to national\nnewspapers do not include their\ntitles on letters or articles. As\npress officer for ConSoc my primary concern is to see that party\npolicy and the interests of\nConSoc as a whole are well and\nfairly represented both on the\npages of Felix and elsewhere and\nto advise the current membership on how this can best be\ndone. In so doing I would prefer\nto work with Felix rather than\nagainst it in achieving a broad\nrange of political opinion on its\npages...\nYours,\nMark Summers\nWhat utter twaddle. Although\neditorial columns are traditionally a little glib, last week's 'erratum' fell squarely on the\naccurate side of opinion.

Offended so many\nmembers of ConSoc, they all\nhave to write in and complain.\nMaybe they're complaining\nbecause you wrote what Mr\nGummer said, not what the vast\nmajorities of right wingers present thought he said. Still, I hypothesis e, maybe ConSoc\nwere right and you presented a massively biased account of the\nproceedings. Shame they\nweren't organised enough to\nsend in one complaint, you got\ntwo, so they both had to be edit-ed. What efficiency.\nIt also seems that you have\ndetected a note of discord in\nConSoc. Maybe they are trying\nto emulate their party by splitting into so many factions it\nbecomes impossible to credit\neach with the same beliefs. On\nthe other hand, maybe the 'Press\nOfficer' wishes to replace Mr\nBayley. Just think, your very own\nJohn Redwood.\nOne final very worrying\nthought - IC ConSoc might be\nour future leaders.

Now I know\nthe RCS have been known to be\na little tiresome in their day, but\nI am incredulous that someone\nappointed to their position so\nthat they could be responsible\nfor the pastoral and social welfare of students should respond\nto a letter of enquiry with 'Yeah,\nI got together with my mates\nand we had a jolly good laugh at\nyour expense.'\nI have a certain degree of\nsympathy with the question any-way: during those heady days of\nsummer last term when people\nseemed to get caught smoking\ndope on site every few minutes, I endeavour ed to find out what\nthe college policy on the subject\nwas.

But there was broad\nagreement that it was 'a difficult\nissue' and that we were in need\nof a standardised policy on the\nsubject.
