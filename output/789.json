    "content": "Features GOING ON THE P ISTE Skiing holidays are\nbecoming cheaper\nand cheaper as cut\nthroat tour\noperators tout for\nbusiness. They\ncombine sun, fresh\nair, fantastic\nscenery, physical\nactivity and a pre s ski to make a thrilling antidote to\nthe academic blues.\nJudith Hackney,\nstill limping\nslightly, tells you\nwhere and when to\ngo and whether it's really worth all the\neffort.\nBefore you decide to try skiing, you\nought to consider just how much the\nholiday will cost you. You shouldn't believe that the \u00a3200 odd you give the\ntour operator will be your major\noutlay. On top of flights and\naccommodation there will be\nequipment to hire, special clothing\nand ski lift passes to buy, lessons to\narrange and over-the-top food and\ndrink prices to pay. Skiing holidays\ndon't come cheap if its your first time. Inhere\nThe first decision you will have to\nmake is which country to visit. Each\nhas its own merits. Austria is said to\nbe the best for beginners, Germany\nthe most friendly and France the best\nfor all types of skiing terrain.\nAustria is still the most popular\ndestination for Britain's first-time\nskiers. Most of the resorts still\nmanage to keep the mountain village\natmosphere which seems preferable\nto the well-designed pre-fab s that\nadorn the French slopes. Cheap out-of-season skiing is also good here\nbecause life in these villages doesn't stop when the holiday trade\ndisappears. Austria does have its\ndisadvantages: it has a high cost-of-living which makes eating out\nexpensive and, because of its cosy\nvillage life, there are very few self-catering apartments. If you want good\na pre s ski it is better to stick to the\nwell-known resorts of Innsbruck or\nKitzbuhel where this is especially\nwell-catered for.\nSwitzerland is out of the price range\nof most of today's students. The\nresorts are populated by the jet-set\nwho have been retreating slowly from\nthe other European towns as the\nprices drop and the lower classes\ninfiltrate their a pre s ski. You can\nexpect to pay at least another \u00a3100 on\ntop if you chose any Swiss resort.\nThe favourite family resorts are\nsituated in France. It was here that the\nmodern-style ski resort took shape,\nwith well-designed apartments and\ngood ski lift networks. Such resorts\nas Les Deux Alpes and Val d'l sere were built solely with skiing in mind.\nLe Village complex in Les Deux\nAlpes, where I spent a week over\nChristmas, boasts skiing from the\ndoorstep with no long cable car rides\nto endure. It also has snow nearby all\nyear round so it was one of the few\nresorts this Christmas which could\noffer skiing after the European thaw.\nMost of the French holidays on\noffer are for self-catering apartments\nwhich cram up to six people, a bathroom, a kitchen area and a lounge\narea into a space no bigger than two\nSouthside rooms. It is important to\nensure that your group gets on well\ntogether because there's no place to\nhide.\nSelf-catering is the cheapest form\nof living because all restaurants\ncharge steep prices in these obvious\ntourist traps and, although\nsupermarket food is not cheap, it's far\ncheaper than having to eat out every\nnight.' There are other European skiing\ndestinations apart from the big three.\nItaly is the next biggest although its\npopularity seems to have declined\nrecently with its bad international\nreputation. Package tours are\navailable to Spain, Andorra, Norway,\nBulgaria and Yugoslavia. There's even Avimore in Scotland, but the\nskiing and weather isn't as good as\nthe alps.\nj^ hen\nSecond is the decision of when to\ntake your skiing trip. The obvious\ndates of Christmas and Easter are\npeak season and tend to be the most\nexpensive. The cheapest time is in\nJanuary or early March. Don't be\ntempted to go before Christmas, even\nthough the fares are cheap because\nmost of the resorts facilities will not\nhave opened for the season. We went\nover Christmas and found that the\nadvertised heated swimming pool was\nstill shut. Our tour guides\n10 Friday January 15th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "1 \u00bb\nv nui um Happy New Year to you all. Let's all\nhope that 1988 will be ten times better\nthan 1987. Spring Term has always\nbeen my favourite of the three. There\nis a spate of annual dinners\nthroughout January and February\nleading up to elections at the end of\nthe term. For first years, this annual\nevent is quite exciting. There's the\nchance to stand for posts within your\nown club or society. It should be\ninteresting to see just who puts\nthemselves forward for major Union\nposts. It's about now that you should\nhave decided which post to stand for.\nAs the time gets nearer FELIX will\nbe carrying features on the sabbatical\nelections, how to stand and how to\nvote.\nLinstead\nWhat a shambles. The brief was for\nLinstead to sell off any items which\nhad been left for years and were not\nclearly marked. So why did they sell\nrecently left equipment, books,\nrecords and clothes especially when\nthey were all marked? College should\nreimburse all claimants immediately.\nBut this won't replace the treasured\nitems which were left in Linstead's care and sold as forgotten items.\nGrants\nBit by bit we're losing the war against\ninflation with less money in students'\npockets again in 88. Student loans are\na thing of the future. FELIX has been\nhard hit as more of the staff have to\nsupplement their incomes with casual\nwork. This must be true of all clubs.\nThe Union cannot distribute the\nWelfare Handbook because they don't believe that they have the forty or so\npeople needed to carry the operation\nout. Nobody is prepared to do\nanything for nothing nowadays. In the\nsixties and seventies the Union had no\ntrouble in finding 'hacks' to help clear\nup after parties, distribute leaflets or\norganise campaigns. But now the\n'hacks' ask: 'what's in it for me?'.\nThey all want posts to add to their\nCVs but they don't want to do the\nwork which their job entails.\nFELIX\nIt's a new year so why not come and\nwork on FELIX.

Parents whose\nresidual income is below \u00a39900 will\nnot be assessed for a contribution.\nThe minimum contribution will rise\nfrom \u00a340 to \u00a350.\nUnion Welfare Officer Pippa\nSalmon said yesterday that 'in view\nof the fact that housing prices in the\nSouth East have gone up by 20% this\nyear and rents accordingly, this\nincrease is laughably small for\nImperial students'.\nUnion President Ian Howgate was\nalso quick to condemn such a small\nincrease. He said, 'my personal\nfeeling is that 4% is obviously\nin suffice nt. The instalment of the cut\nin Housing Benefit in April means\nthat they are instigating the student\nloan system already.' He went on to\ncall for a co-ordinated national\ncampaign by students. 'We need a national union which operates\nproperly but unfortunately we don't have one of those,' he said. 'At the\nmoment we can't fight the Thatcherite\ngovernment without proper\ncoordination.'\nFELIX carried out a straw poll in\nthe Union Building yesterday and\ncouldn't find one student who was\nsatisfied with the increase.

The present\nstores will continue to organise\nstorage, delivery and collection of gas\ncylinders, and purchase and storage\nof cleaning materials. The stationery\nstores will be moved to Sherfield and\nall scientific consumables will be de-centralised. The stores staff have\nargued that this is effectively closing\nthe Stores from August 1 this year.\nJohn Smith, in a circulated letter,\nclaims that 'these changes are\nexpected to make savings on staff\ncosts, space, vehicle cost and\nmaintenance, and the reduction of\nstocks held centrally'. However, the\nStores staff say that only Central\nFinance will save money as the\nexpense is shifted from Central\nAdministration' to the departments.\nThey believe that College stocks will\nhave to increase overall, rather than\nbeing reduced, if sixteen de-centralised stores are set up and\ntherefore the space needed to store\nthese items will increase.\nMr Smith has also assured all\nCentral Stores staff that they will be\n'offered alternative work within the\nCollege'. Both the staff and their\nunion representatives from IC\nNALGO believe that nine jobs will be\nlost as a result as technicians and\nhandlers are persuaded to take\nvoluntary redundancy.\nThe staff feelings are running very\nhigh at the moment. They believe that\nadministration have not treated them\nfairly and have let the Central Stores\nrun down over the last ten years. They\nargue that great savings can be made\nthrough central ordering and Stores\nmodernisation which has been\nrejected by administration.\nThere is a joint purchasing power\nof \u00a3'/2 million and Requisitions\nbelieve that they can save \u00a350,000 a year through centralised bulk\npurchasing from the right suppliers.\nThis 'could wipe out the \u00a33m deficit'\nrather than trying to skimp on a few\njobs. The discounts are much less for\nsmall purchases.\nMr Terry Neville, who has the\noverall responsibility for Central\nStores, told FELIX yesterday that\ndepartments had 'voted with there\nfeet' over the last few years. He\nbelieves that departments can demand\nthe same discounts as the present\ncentral service. He is confident that\nmany suppliers are willing to deliver\nto individual departments at short\nnotice. He told us that 'departments\ncan get most supplies cheaper\nelsewhere any way'. He believes that\nthis plan is ideal because it cuts\nstaffing costs and each department can\ncater for its own specialist needs. He\nsaid that the response has been 'quite\npositive so far' from departments and\nhe expects savings to be in the order\nof \u00a3100,000. As far as job losses were\nconcerned he said that 'no pressure\nhas been put on staff to take\nredundancy'.\nNALGO representative Janice\nLewis is arranging a campaign to save\nCentral Stores to start next Monday.\nShe is angry that the College\nadministration have no concrete\narguments for their decision. She is\nalso concerned about the lack of\nconsultation between the staff,\nadministration and the departments\nwhich will have to take on their own\npurchasing and supplies; she believes\nthat 'it clearly hasn't been thought\nthrough properly'. Other staff believe\nthe plan to be 'short-sighted' and\n'naive'.\nThe NALGO campaign will consist\nof posters, lobbying for departmental\nsupport and a petition which all\nstudents are invited to sign. The staff\nhave already made representations to\nthe Rector.\nIf you wish to sign the petition,\nCentral Stores staff have given\nFELIX a copy which students can\nsign.\nMeanwhile 1200 items are out of\nstock in Central Stores due to the\nbreakdown of computers in Sherfield\nat the beginning of December.\nLRT rise\nFrom January 10 London Regional\nTransport has operated its increased\nfares which once again will hit\nstudents' pockets. A two zone ticket\nwill now cost 80p( previously 70p) and a three zone ticket increased to\n\u00a31.10 (\u00a31 before). However travel on\nbus or tube in the central zone\nremains the same at 50p. Travelcards\nhave gone up by 30p to \u00a32 and all\nzone Capitalcards now cost \u00a32.60.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "recommended that March was the\nbest time to go to France because that\nis when the snow is the thickest and\nthe p is tes the clearest. March also has\nthe added advantage of longer\ndaylight hours so there's more time\non the precious slopes. That late in\nthe season the weather can be\nrelatively hot and ultraviolet rays are\nin abundance. If you do go in March,\nit is best to take a high factor sun\ncream and lip protector.\nflo thing Once you have made the decision\nwhere and when to go, there are\nessential items of clothing which have\nto be bought or borrowed. Good ski\nclothing is very expensive so a first\ntime skier should try to borrow as\nmuch as he/she can. This, in my\nexperience, is not the easiest of tasks.\nHardened skiers are reluctant to let\ntheir clothing go on holiday without\nthem for fear of having their designer\nsalo pet tes ripped to shreds by an\ninexperienced student. I ended up\nhaving to buy most of the essential\nitems. This only applies to clothing.\nIt is best to hire skis, poles and boots\nin the resort as they can fit everything\nto you exact requirement.\nWhen you buy your jacket make\nsure that arm movement is not\nrestricted in any way. It will cost\naround \u00a360 for a good, well-insulated\njacket so buy one which you can wear\nin London afterwards, just in case you\ndecide skiing is not for you. I tried\nmost of the well-known sports shops\nin London before deciding on one\nfrom C&A whose Rodeo Collection\nis the best-selling make in Great\nBritain. You will also need ski pants\nor salo pet tes, which are high-waist ed, padded trousers that cover your\nkidneys for added protection.\nSalopettes are the best but make you\nlook very silly. Alternatively, you can\nbuy a ski suit. But you can't wear a ski suit to College if you've decided\nagainst skiing again.\nThe most important item to buy is\na pair of ski gloves. You can't get\naway with the ones you usually wear\nin London. One of the members of\nmy ski party thought that he could and\nsoon discovered how uncomfortable\nit was to ski with freezing cold, wet\nhands. You should make sure that the\nones you buy have leather palms and\na slight curl in the fingers. They\nshould go several inches beyond your\nwrists so that any jacket will overlap\nand no cold air will get to them.\nYou'll also need a ski-hat because a large percentage of your body heat\nescapes through the head. Remember\nto pack ski sunglasses, several thick\nski socks and lots of thin polo neck\njumpers. Several thin layers are better\nthan one thick layer.\nquip ment When you finally make it to your\nchosen resort you will have to hire\nboots and skis. Skis should come up\nto between shoulder and head height,\ndepending on your build. You should\ncheck that there are no gouges in the\nbase and that the bindings are easy to\nstep into and release. The hire shop\nwill alter them to suit your height and\nability.\nThe most important item of your\nequipment is your pair of boots.\nYou'll have a miserable holiday if\nyour feet are uncomfortable or cold.\nTry walking around the shop for a few minutes with the boots on before\naccepting them and if you're\nunhappy, change them.\nWesson s One of my mistakes this Christmas\nwas to believe that I could go skiing\nwithout first taking lessons. If you are\na first timer it is best to take a few\ndry slope lessons in Britain before you\ngo. While the ones who believed they\ncould ski without doing this, spent the\nholiday on their bottoms, the ones\nwho did, ski i ed off into the sunset.\nSkiing holidays are much more fun if\nyou can stay upright for most of the\ntime. The ICU Ski Club organises\ntrips to a local dry ski slope most\nweeks.\nSome people chose to take lessons\nat their resorts. These aren't cheap\nand most foreign instructors have\ndifficulty explaining in English. If\nyou're unlucky you will end up\npaying through the nose for an\narrogant fool who just-wants to show\nhow good a skier he is compared to\nyou.\nxe rc is es Many ski books will recommend\nthat you do a few exercises before\nyour holiday. This may be necessary\nif you're an expert skier but I didn't experience any aches or pains from\nany of the gentle skiing I performed.\nPrice The advantage of the cut-throat\ntactics of today's tour operators is that\nskiing holidays are getting cheaper.\nI have discovered recently that\nHorizon have a special 'First Timer's' six-day ski package to Austria. The\nflight and accommodation for seven\ndays costs from \u00a3232-\u00a3347 depending\non the season and the First Timer's pack an additional \u00a3146.50-\u00a3156.50.\nWhen I visited Les Deux Alpes this\nChristmas a six day ski pass cost \u00a364,\nlessons (12 hours total in groups of\nten) cost around \u00a345 and ski and boot\nhire \u00a340.\nConclusions Today's skiing technology is much\nmore sophisticated than a decade ago.\nThe boots are designed to protect your\nankles and, in so doing, make your\nknees more vulnerable. The first\nlesson to learn is how to fall without\nhurting yourself. I didn't and missed\nthree days skiing with an injured\nknee. The second lesson is how to\nslow down and stop without falling\nover.\nI enjoyed my first skiing holiday\ndespite the falling over. I will, no\ndoubt, be gracing the slopes in the\nfuture. I also found the whole\nexperience surprisingly relaxing. This\nmay have had something to do with\nmy lack of skiing, my excess of fresh\nair and sun, and a severe case of over-eating. It did have its downs (literally)\nas well as its ups but I can thoroughly\nrecommend skiing as a wonderful\nantidote to the academic blues.\nFELIX Friday January 15th198811 "

    "content": "H HP\" pcie tyR age Before starting this week's article I feel it necessary to reply to my critics.\nTo all the people I have either upset\nor angered, it was never my intention\nto and I do apologise. The comments\nmade have been noted and I shall\nattempt to follow them.\nI must make it clear that this\ncolumn is not an official communique\nfrom the St Mary's Student Union,\nmerely the personal view of one\nstudent (who tries to reflect typical\nstudent life).\nThis month it has been pleasing to\nsee three students from St Mary's playing in national rugby trials with\nKevin Simms (Wasps), a regular\nEngland Centre returning to the team\nplaying the French at the Pare des\nPrinces in Paris. The other two\nplayers\u2014Sean O 'Leary (also of\nWasps) and Richard Wintle (London\nWelsh) playing second row and right\nwing respectively, distinguished\nthemselves playing for the seconds\nsides in the respective national trials.\nIt must be noted that all three do not\nplay for St Mary's regularly, only for\nthe special occasions which include\nthe Hospital's Cup and the annual\nCambridge University fixture.\nEligible to play for St Mary's are a whole team of excellent players\nregularly turning out for noted\nLondon sides. One cannot for a minute disagree with their decision to\ngain deserved recognition by playing\nfor clubs that can offer a good fixture\nlist.\nThe problem is Catch 22. St Mary's can no longer offer first class fixtures\nto entice quality players, but on the\nother hand in the new league system\none has to earn the right for first class\nfixtures. Thus the problem cannot be\nresolved due to the unusual situation\nof a student team playing good rugby\nof the time but never able to realise\nthe full potential of the talent\navailable.\nWhat can be done has been\ndemonstrated with a string of victories\nincluding Hospitals' Cups, 7-a side\ncompetitions and last year's win\nagainst Cambridge University. Not\nbad for a potential pool of only 250\nmale students, of which only xh are\nseriously interested in the game.\nRugby has, and will continue to\nplay a large part in the social strata\nof life at St Mary's, and while it may\nnot be the sole reason for the outside\nworld to know of St Mary's and its\nhigh standards it must be pretty close.\nPARACHUTE CLUB\nMaxim ising the jumps We have another first time jump\ncourse. It is organised for the\nevenings of Feburary 2nd and 3rd for\nground training in College. First\njumps will be on the weekend of the\n6th and 7th of February\u2014weather\npermitting. The cost is \u00a365 and \u00a34\nmembership plus a \u00a315 deposit is\nrequired ahead of time. Our meetings\nare at 12.30pm on Mondays in the\nUnion Lower Lounge. Come next\nMonday to book your place.\nThose who have seen me already\nabout this course please come along\non Monday as well or contact me\nthrough pigeonholes.\nMax Hung von Herbing,\nChairman, Parachute Club.\nCOOKERY\nCLUB\nCelery and ham\nrollers\nThis is an extremely easy meal to\ncook and is ideal as lunch or a late\nsupper. You can substitute asparagus\nshoots for the celery hearts if you\nprefer. I like the combination of the\nhot cheese on the cold ham but others\nlike to bake the dish. The quantities\nshown should give you a healthy meal\nfor one.\nIngredients\n15g butter\nVi tbs. flour\nV* pint milk\n50g grated cheese\n2 celery hearts, halved\n(or asparagus shoots)\n4 slices of ham\nMethod\nMelt the butter and remove from the\nheat. Add the flour and cook the roux\nfor 1 minute. Gradually stir in the\nmilk and bring it to the boil. Add most\nof the cheese and season to taste.\nWrap each bit of celery in a slice\nof ham and place it in a grill proof\ndish. Pour the cheese sauce over the\nham and sprinkle the top with the\nextra cheese. Grill until the top begins\nto brown.\nIf the hot\u2014cold combination does not\nappeal to you then try baking at 180\ndeg C for 20 minutes before grilling.\nGood appetite.\nWIN \u00a3 5 0\nDEBATING\nCOMPETITION\nMeet Physics UG Common Room, Level212.30 pm WED20 th JAN EVERYONE WELCOME\nFELIX Friday January 15th198817 "

However, when\nwife and daughter are out of town, he\nhas a passionate affair with Alex\nForrest, an unmarried publishing\nexecutive. For Dan, this is a whirlwind thing\u2014intense but\nshort lived. However Alex wants\nmore.\nAfter the heap of excrement that\nwas the designer S&M of 9'A Weeks, Adrian Lyne now tries his\nhand at designer psycho pathology and\nthe result isn't much better than his\nprevious work. In this film, culture\nis a fondness of Madame Butterfly,\nand style amounts to expensive\nclothes, famous locations and flashy\nediting. At one point, we cut back so\noften to Alex's seemingly lifeless\nbody in a bath that you just can't not\nknow that she's going to rise up.\"\nMuch has been made out of the\nsteamy scenes between Alex and Dan,\nbut Fatal Attraction is actually quite\nconservative. Dan and Alex may have\nsex in a kitchen sink, but the big\nmessage of the film is 'don't stray\nfrom the path'.\nFatal Attraction seems to me to be\nyet another addition to the yuppies-in-peril catalogue of films. However,\nit is also not ici bly a product of the\npost-AIDS sexual climate. Alex,\nexcellently played by Glenn Close,\nrapidly loses her character, becoming\na vengeful rampaging psychopath.\nDan's part in the affair, and therefore\nwhat should be his share of the blame,\nis quickly forgotten in a knock down,\ndrag out fight. Alex, it is made clear\nfrom the start, is bad news\u2014you are\nbeaten over the head with this. Alex\nis overtly sexy\u2014Dan's wife plain, just\npretty. Alex's loft is barren, bleak,\nfilmed in colourless tones. Dan's flat\nis homely clutter, filmed in warm\ninviting colours. And if the audience\nstill doesn't get the message, Alex's loft is pointedly set in the meatpacking district of the city. The poor\nwoman never stood a chance.\nWhat at first seems to start as an\nintelligent film about adultery soon\nbecomes pretty objectionable in the\nway it relies on an image of the\nsexually independent single woman as\nclinging and psychotic. Give Fatal\nAttraction a miss\u2014it's long, heavily\nover-directed in places and ultimately\nthe male comes out on top yet again.\nC.R. Aaron Kotcheff\nCharles Robin\nvim Near Dark\nNear Dark is another contemporary\nvampire story\u2014vampires on the road,\nin a way. Farm boy Caleb Cotton,\nlooking for excitement, takes a strangely beautiful young woman,\nMae, for a ride in his truck. As dawn\napproaches, she demands to be taken \u2022\nhome and he insists on a kiss first. She\nbites his neck and runs off. Since his\ntruck won't start Caleb has to walk\nhome\u2014and the sun, when it rises,.\nsears his flesh. And so\"begins what\nis probably the most off-beat vampire\nmovie since The Hunger. Near Dark\nhomes in on the hysterical violence\nbeneath a folksy surface, like David\nLynch's Blue Velvet. An innocent boy\nis drawn by his desire for something\ndifferent into a sado-erotic nightmare\nworld, which threatens to destroy\nhim. And, as in Blue Velvet, Caleb\novercomes the monstrous vampire\nfamily so that the good and normal\none can prevail.\nWhereas Blue Velvet centres on its\nyoung hero's fantasies, Near Dark\nmakes skillful use of the vampire\ngenre to give Caleb's battle for\nsurvival a mythic dimension. The\nvampires stand for Society's outcasts,\nwandering the land wreaking unholy\nvengeance: their battle scarred leader,\nJesse, sporting long rider coat and\npony tail, fought for the doomed\nSouth in the civil war. His partner,\nDiamond Back, was a wanderer.\n'Young' Homer was a high school\nmisfit and the pathologically blood\nthirsty Severen sports bikers jacket\nand spurs.\nThe vampires are sometimes treated\nwith black humour (Jesse coughs up\na bullet and hands it back to the man\nwho just shot him with it) but never\nare they glamour is ed: they are\nunremitting ly evil. The film also\nmanages to steer clear of a few clich es such as the long fangs\u2014but the\nvampire mythology has also been\nchanged a little bit, to allow a blood\ntransfusion to cure the afflicted.\nDespite this Near Dark is qu tie close\nto Bram Stoker's Dracula making\nmany of the latter's submerged\nthemes, especially the erotic\nundertones, more explicit.\nCaleb finds himself unable to kill\n. his own victims and therefore has to\nlead a parasitic al existence off Mae.\nAnd the scenes in which he drinks her\nblood from her wrists are intensely\nand disturbingly erotic. In other\nwords, vampirism is the ultimate\nzip less sex.\nNear Dark is almost as much a Western as it is a vampire film. Caleb\nengineers the escape of the vampires\nfrom a police ambush\u2014and is\nrewarded by Severen giving him one\nof his spurs. Later, when Caleb rides\nout to confront the vampires he does\nso on a horse. And the final battle has\na definite show-down feel to it.\nNear Dark is a thoughtful film-one of the few in the vampire genre\nwhich actually raises the question of\nwhether or not it's nice to be a vampire, and gives a real impression\nof the difficulties involved in sucking\nblood: T hate it when they don't shave' complains Severen, just before\ntucking in.\nIf you're in the mood for something\na bit off the wall, but not too much\nso, Near Dark is probably your kind\nof film.\nC.R. The Woo-Woo Kid\nA charming story of 'Sonny'\nWisecarver, a15 year old who\nbecame something of a national\ncelebrity in wartime America, after\nbecoming romantically entangled with\ntwo married women, and\nsubsequently chased around the\ncountry by the authorities and scandal\nhungry press. The story is treated\nwith a light, rather glossy, Hollywood\nstyle but is definitely amusing and\noccasionally hilarious. The central\ncharacter, Sonny, was often\nreminiscent of Woody Allen in his\nbemused innocence, and the whole\nfilm had a modest, un imposing atmosphere rare to American cinema.\nA.K. Predator\nAs one would expect, bulging biceps\nand macho wise-cracks abound in\nPredator, the latest production\nstarring Arnold 'intelligent\nSchwarzenegger. Arnie, plus team of\nseasoned mercenaries do battle with\na high-tech alien who seems to want\nto kill anything warm-blooded he\ncomes across for no particular reason\nwhatsoever. Despite having some of\nthe deadliest man-portable artillery\nyou're ever likely to see, the men get\npicked off one by one very much in\nAlien style, but without the\nimagination or subtlety of that film\nHowever Predator is well produced\nand, treated with the amount of\nrespect you might give an episode of\nthe A Team, is good entertainment\nand proffers a few laughs.\nA.K. THEA THE\nIan McKellen Acting\nShakespeare\nThe Playouse, Adjacent to\nEmbankment Underground Station\nThis is probably one of the best one-man shows that London has ever\nseen\u2014actor Ian McKellen takes his\naudience on a tour of the life and plays\nof William Shakespeare. He plays the\npart of the playwright, as well as all\nof his famous characters\u2014and he does\nit all without one change of costume.\nMcKellen switches from Prince Hal\nto Hamlet to Polonius to Juliet with\nawesome ease.

    "content": "F\"EE II The game of Go The game of Go (nothing to do with monopoly) is played regularly\nby the Imperial College Chinese Chess Society. Proper name\nWeichi, the oriental game is played with Hsiang ch'i. Chris Eardley\ndescribes how Go is a subtle strategy game which requires tactics\nentirely different to those of Western chess.\ncrop up, and it can be summaries ed in one phrase\u2014give and take. Greedy\nplayers always lose, and so do meek\nand timid players. Moderation is the\nwatchword. If a player claims too\nmuch territory he can only guard it\nthinly, so he will lose it. If he over-attacks his opponent and indulges in\ntoo much 'rape and pillage' he will\nsuddenly find himself being attacked.\nThe techniques of attack in Go are\nquite subtle and usually work best if\ncontact with the opponent is avoided.\nThe aim is usually to manipulate the\nopponent rather than take him out\ncompletely. Of course, the\nopportunity to wipe out some local\nopposition in big fights does occur,\nand is highly exciting, but this\nPicture in your mind a game of\nordinary western chess after a few\nopening moves have been played.\nNow modify the game in two ways.\nIn chess, the separate pieces, with\ntheir separate identities and powers,\ntogether form an army, and the game\nis about one army battling against the\nother. For the first modification,\nshrink one of these armies down into\none piece, into one unit, and let you\nand your opponents have 180 of these\narmy pieces to distribute at will on the\nboard. This gives rise to the next\nmodification\u2014add another 300\nsquares to the board. These\nmodifications have the effect of\nconverting the localised battle of chess\ninto a full scale war using many\narmies over a large area. This new\ngame is called Go.\nGo is a strategy game for two\nplayers using black and white\nidentical pieces on a brown wooden\nboard marked with an almost square\ngrid of 19 x19 lines, giving 361\nplaying points.\nThe game starts with the board\nempty and players take it in turn to\nplace pieces anywhere they like on the\nboard. Pieces do not move about the\nboard but stay in the same position\nthroughout the game. The object of\nthe game is to create more territory\nthan the opponent by surrounding\nsegments of empty space with\nuniform lines of pieces. If your\nopponent gets in the way you can\nsurround him too and remove him\nfrom the board, but this is a secondary\nobjective. Go is a constructive game\nin that there are more pieces on the\nboard at the end of the game than at\nthe start, in contrast to most other\n'war' games.\nCalling Go a war game is in fact\nfairly misleading, though for most\npeople this is the easiest concept to\nhave when they start playing for the\nfirst time. It takes only a short while\nhowever, before beginners sense the\nsubtlety and depth to the game\u2014it is\nindeed a game of war, with both\nplayers spending much of their time\ntrying to kill each others pieces, but\nthe rest of the time is spent building\nterritories in a constructive manner\nand only 'leaning' on the opponent\nrather than going in for the kill all the\ntime. When an attack is made, it is\ndone subtly\u2014not much 'cut and\nthrust' occurs in Go because it doesn't work. In chess, for example, a queen\nand a rook can be let loose for a while\nto bash up the enemy, and indeed this\nis a most enjoyable occupation. When\nthe pair have finished they can retire\nbehind their pawns and be safe. This\ndoesn't happen in Go because the\npieces do not move around, and so\nonce committed to an attack, it has to\nbe followed through right to the end\nbecause it is impossible to 'pull out'.\nIf the attack is mis-handled then the\nmistake sits there on the board staring\nback at you for the rest of the game.\nWhen attacking the opponent's pieces, his pieces are also a threat to\nyours and very often an attack has to\nbe suddenly turned into a defence for\na few moves, then back to an attack,\nand the defence, and so on. This is\none of the beauties of the game\u2014it is\nimpossible to bludgeon an opponent\nwithout having to let him make major\ngains against you. The game has a built-in s tabi lising effect which defies\nexplanation but which never ceases to\nhappens comparatively rarely.\nIn Go there are no guns or cannons\nor tanks, or in fact anything remotely\nviolent to look at or use. All the pieces\nare identical round counters and none\nof them has special powers or moves.\nIndividual pieces are worthless; it is\nthe position they are in that is\nimportant. In chess, for example,\nplayers have armies that they put into\nbattle against each other, and in effect\nthe players 'hide' behind their\npieces\u2014they are one stage removed\nfrom the theatre of operations. In Go,\nthere are no such armies and the\nplayers are brought right into the\naction and it becomes a much more\nintense fight, not between armies, but\nbetween minds. Go players locked in\ncombat stare intensely at the board\nwith their knuckles white, hands\nclammy and stomachs churning. They\nare totally immersed in action which\nto an outsider seems pretty boring, but\nto them is a matter of life and death.\nIn this sense Go is the ultimate war\ngame: there are no objects of war in\nsight, yet the players are trying to tear\neach other apart.\nPeople who like arguing should\nenjoy Go, because many of the fights\ncan be likened to arguments. If black\ninvades white's territory he is telling\nwhite that he has a point to make, and\nwhat's more, he is right. What\nhappens next is highly interesting\nbecause white has to listen to black's point of view (ie that white has too\nmuch territory and should surrender\nsome) and agree or disagree. If he\nagrees with black it means that black\nattacked successfully and white gives\nway and battens down any remaining\nopen hatches. If white disagrees, he\nanswers with a counter-attack on\nblack, leaving black to ponder. After\na few moves of this 'argument', and\nbefore its logical conclusion, it\nbecomes clear to the players who is\ngoing to be the eventual winner, and\nthe argument stops, because there is\nno point in continuing\u2014the point has\nbeen made. To give a ridiculous\nanalogy, it's a bit like Julius Caesar\nstorming into Gaul with 1000 men\nand coming face to face with a million\nGauls. Some people would advocate\nfighting to the death; they lose every\ngame of Go. In a case like this if\nCaesar fights to the death the Gauls\nwin. If he doesn't fight, the Gauls\nwin. There is no argument, and\nCaesar should get out of Gaul\nsharp ish. In this way fights are left\nunfinished all around the board\nbecause both players see that in 3\nmoves time, say, one of them will die,\nso what is the point of carrying on.\nIf you're arguing with someone and\nyou suddenly see that you have\nargued your way into a hole, then you\nshut up there and then unless you're\none of those tiresome people who like\narguing that black is white. The nice\nthing about Go is that if someone does\ntry that argument you can always\nprove them wrong. Of course the\ntrick lies in working out whether\nyou're going to win the argument\nbefore you start it.\nIn Summary\nGo is one of the most beautiful games\nin the world because of its simplicity,\nelegance and its many hidden\nsubtleties. It looks pretty as well.\nIt is a battle of minds rather than\narmies of pieces, because the pieces\ndirectly relate to your thoughts\u2014they\nare not coloured by any special\npowers a piece may have.\nIt is a game of extreme violence\u2014\nlife or death, yet players have to live\nwith each other on the same board.\nA player can never be totally wiped\nout. In this sense it is more\nconstructive than most war type\ngames which are usually a fight to the\ndeath.\nAnyone who likes a good strategy\ngame should like Go, and anyone who\nis fond of a good (logical) argument\nought to get hooked on it without too\nmuch effort. It takes five minutes to\nlearn to play, so come and see for\nyourself at one of our meetings during\nTuesday and Thursday lunchtimes in\nElec Eng 403b. FELIX Friday January 15th19889 "

Not only was it insulting to\nsecretaries but on the whole meaningless and I feel that\nthe printing of it was very insensitive on your part,\nconsidering that young secretaries make up a large number\nof the non-academic staff at Imperial.\nThe statement itself, made by a furrier, just goes to show\nhow out of touch they are with the public's awareness.\nIf they are finding it so hard to sell cheap fur then why\ndo they go on butchering animals, and trying to persuade\nwomen that wearing dead rabbits on their backs is still\nglamourous and desirable.\nYours sincerely,\nKay Randall, Secretary, Chemistry Dept.\nGlad to be\nLiberal\nDear FELIX,\nI must object to James Papa's suggestion (FELIX 788)\nthat Liberals used the slogan T haven't been kissed by Peter\nTatchelF in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election. I worked\nfor Simon Hughes, the successful Liberal candidate\nthroughout this by-election, and never once saw or heard\nthis slogan or anything else anti-gay used by Liberals.\nIt is often forgotten that right up until the last week of\nthe by-election it was seen as a two horse race between\nLabour's Peter Tatchell, and John O 'Grady the\nIndependent Labour candidate. The Economist actually\nprinted a cartoon of the two of them on horses a week\nbefore the by-election. Most of the anti-gay smears that\nappeared came from the O 'Grady campaign, the rest from\nthe Tories, NF etc. It is possible that some O 'Grady\nsupporters, realising their cause was hopeless, came over\nin the last few days to help Simon Hughes and continued\nto use anti-gay smears on the doorsteps. At this stage in\nthe campaign there were hundreds of people coming to\nhelp, and it was obviously impossible to check the political\nsoundness of every volunteer who turned up. But I am\nsure if anyone had been heard using the slogan mentioned\nby James Papa they would have been told to leave.\nLiberals have long been the party which has worked\nhardest for gay rights. Labour has jumped on the issue\nin their usual inept way and only whipped up more\nprejudice. Many of my Liberal friends are gay. As an\nundergraduate at IC in the late 1970s, and a member of\nthe IC Liberal Club then, at the time the most active\npolitical society in College, I remember being constantly\nhassled for our support of gay rights, particularly as the\nJeremy Thorpe case was then in the headlines. The\nstandard slogan was then 'Backs against the wall, it's the\nliberals'. The Socialist Society actually circulated a spoof\nof our 'Forward!' newsletter, called 'Sideways!' full of\nanti-gay jokes. I am sure that much of this material can\nbe found in the Union archives, and I ask Mr Papa to look\nit up before spreading more smears about the Liberal Party.\nI campaigned for Simon Hughes because he stands for\nthe sort of radical Liberalism I believe in, and which is\nnow threatened by merger with the SDP. Seeing Simon\nelected as MP for Bermondsey was one of the proudest\nmoments of my life, and I am sorry that the Labour Party,\nthe world's worse losers, continues to tell lies about the\nelection.\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Huntbach, Dept of Computing.\nHamlet's hardships\nDear Judith,\nOn Tuesday December 1 the warden of Hamlet Gardens\nwas notified that the immersion heater in flat 210 Hamlet\nGardens was not functioning thereby causing the residents\nof the above some discomfort, as they could not even wash\nproperly. In the two weeks after the defect was reported\nthe warden was re-notified at least three times until on\nWednesday December lb a letter was sent by the residents\nproposing to go and see the fair rent officer for\nHammersmith if the defect was not repaired. A repair was\ncarried out on the following day (December 17).\nOn the evening of Saturday December 19 the water\nheater again ceased to function. We think we have\nreasonable cause to feel that neither the warden of Hamlet\nGardens nor Strolmoor Ltd, the landlords, are fulfilling\ntheir obligations to these students of Imperial College who\nare in residence at Hamlet Gardens.\nWe wish to protest in the strongest manner possible\nabout the amount of attention afforded to the above flat\n(and probably the rest of Hamlet Gardens) by the two\nagents in question.\nW J M Keys, Andrew Marsh, David Hendy, TP Weggett.\nCocktail\nthank you\nDear Judith,\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank Sarah Cox\nand all the students who acted as hosts at the Guilds\nCocktail Party. The event was a tremendous success. If\nanyone is interested in seeing the letters of thanks then\nplease contact me in the Guilds Office.\nDave Tyler, Guilds President.\nFELIX Friday January 15th198819 "

    "content": "review j MUSIC\nby Phil Young\nHi! A belated welcome to 1988 from\nthe all-new FELIX music column,\nbringing you previews and reviews of\ngigs and rec rods, concentrating on\nnon-mainstream music\u2014those not in\nfavour can go and listen to BBC\nRadio. Recovering from the\ntraditional Christmas gig wilderness,\nthe London live scene starts tonight!\nFor those of you not going to see\nBuday Curtess tonight at College, you\ncould try the Boogie Brothers at\nDingwall's, Camden at 8pm( \u00a35). For\nvibrant blues and soul complete with\npork pie hats and shades. If you miss\nthem you can see them on Sunday at\n9pm for \u00a34 at the Half Moon, Putney.\nIf your appetite was whetted by\nHowlin' Wilf & the Vee Jays at\nCollege last term, you can see them\nat the Dublin Castle in Camden\ntonight at 8.30pm for \u00a33, or\ntomorrow at the King's Head, Fulham\nHigh Street, at 8pm for \u00a33. Punk fans\ncan see Chelsea\u2014remember them?\u2014\ntonight at the Marquee in Wardour\nStreet, Soho at 7pm for \u00a33.50, and\ndevotees of the speed poet John\nCooper Clarke can see him in action\nat the Cricketer's, by the Oval at 8pm for \u00a33. Marillion fans can try and buy\na ticket from the touts to see them at\nHammersmith Odeon between\nSaturday and Tuesday.\nGig of the week has to be Pop Will\nEat Itself'at ULU tonight at 7.30pm, \u00a34.50 on the door, for a night of sexist\nhip-hop gre bol s doing self-indulgent\nthrash and parody.\nOn Saturday 23rd, The Triffids play\nthe Astoria and Echo and the\nBunnymen play Brixton Academy,\nEric Clapton appears on January\n25-27, 29-31 at the Albert Hall.\nDefinitely worth missing are the\nAlarm on February 9 at Hammersmith\nOdeon.\nGig of the week: self-indulgent Pop Will Eat Itself at ULU tonight\nAlbum review:\nThe Smiths\u2014Strangeways here we come\nDeterred from buying this one\nbecause of the lousy music press\nreviews, I find this album distinctive\nfrom previous Smiths' material. A not i cable lack of Morrissey one-liners\nis countered by a stronger\ninstrumental input. Don't be put off\nby the single 'Girlfriend in a Coma'.\nGems like 'Stop Me If You've Heard\nThis One Before' and 'Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me'\nput this album amongst their best.\nFOOTBALL\nby Adrian Grainger\nA week after the FA Cup third round,\nLondon's teams return to the league\ntrail with some exciting matches in\nprospect:\nAll matches are on Saturday\nJanuary 16th with 3pm kick-offs.\nQueens Park Rangers v West Ham\nDivision 1, Loftus Road,\nShepherds Bush (tube)\nA clash between the hooped Rangers\nand the pride of East London is\nmouth-watering. QPR have faltered\nlately but are still a force with new\nsigning Mark Falco settling in well,\nscoring two FA Cup goals last week.\nWest Ham have had their problems\nthis year v. 'th injuries to key men like\nAlviu Martin, but after a cup victory\nover Charlton last week, a draw\nseems likely. Watch out for the skills\nof Liam Brady whose curling free\nkick goal last week was superb. Go\nalong to see football on plastic, its the\nlast season at Loftus Road.\nTottenham v Coventry\nDivision 1, White Hart Lane,\nSeven Sisters (tube).\nThe obvious comparisons will be\nmade with this being the repeat of last\nyear's FA Cup Final. This match\nthough should be a reverse of that\nMay result, a classic match is\nunlikely. Terry Venables is slowly\nforming Spurs into a winning side\nwith an impressive cup win at Oldham\nunder his belt. Clive Allen seems also\nto have returned to form. Coventry\nare struggling near the foot of the\ntable and are finding it tough to live\nas cup winners. Regis is playing well\nthough with memories of his great\ndays at WBA. The walk from the tube\nis 25 minutes long, so I would wait\nfor a better match than this to see.\nWimbledon v Watford\nDivision 1, Plough Lane,\nWimbledon Park (tube).\nWimbledon are 'on a roller' with six\nstraight wins including a demolition\nof WBA last week. John Fashanu,\nVinny Jones and other part-time\nplayers have made the Dons a strong\nr or ce, not given enough credit for\ntheir achievements. They are my top\nfor the cup this year. Watford are a poor side with recent turmoil about\ntheir ownership not helping their\nleague position. New man Steve\nHarrison has problems indeed. They\nstruggled in the Cup and should\nreceive a lesson or two in this match.\nCrystal Palace v Huddersfield\nDivision 2, Selhurst Park,\nNorwood Junction (BR)\nPalace are playing very well and I think that they are a good bet for\npromotion. I saw them demolish\nPlymouth 5-1 and their rhyming and\nroaming strikers Bright and Wright\n(37 goals between them this season)\nbeing devastating. Huddersfield have\nnew manager Malcolm MacDonald\nbut are still smarting from their 0-1\ndefeat at Manchester City. Palace\nshould take the 3 points without\nbreaking into a gallop.\nMillwall v Middlesborough\nDivision 2, The Den,\nNew Cross (tube)\nAlthough this is the match of the day\nin the second division, I would keep\nwell clear. I saw Millwall at West\nHam and their bad reputation with\ntheir fans is justified. There were 40\narrests at Arsenal in the cup last week\nas well. Tony Cascarino is Millwall's best player, a fighting 17 goal striker.\nMiddlesborough were top but\nhave d dropped back lately and could\nonly draw with non-league Sutton last\nweek. 17 goal Slaven is their star\nstriker. Millwall might just sneak it.\nFulham v Port Vale\nDivision 3, Craven Cottage,\nPutney Bridge (tube)\nThis doesn't seem on paper a very\nexciting game, but you never know.\nFulham are a decent side and Terry\nMcCann will always stick with them.\n18 goal Rosenior is the key. The lads\nfrom the potteries are near the foot\nof the table. I saw a game at Vale Park\nabout 5 years ago and the atmosphere\nof financial heartache and old\ntraditions was a saddening feeling.\nFulham should win.\nLeyton Orient v Crewe\nDivision 4, Brisbane Road,\nLeyton (tube)\nThe home team with their new name\nare second in the league and deserve\nto climb up a division. The East\nLondon reds are in round four of the\nFA Cup which may prove a distraction though. Crewe are mid-table, better than usual for them, and\nhave a good away record. Orient's form should see them pull further\naway with Wolves at the top\nLondon game of the day:\nQPR v West Ham.\nFriday January 15th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": ">\u00bbi8f# Bad news for atom power1988 is going to be a terrible year for\nthe nuclear industry. At the end of last\nyear this column reported that studies\nof the survivors from Hiroshima and\nNagasaki had shown higher than\nexpected incidences of cancer, forty\nyears after the bombings (latest news:\nNew Scientist 7th January 1988 p46). The first few weeks of the new year\nhave already seen worse news.\nA horrific study of the effects of\nfallout from Chernobyl on American\nmortality rates is about to be\npublished (see The Independent 4th January pi4). The main conclusion of\nthe report is that radiation kills many\npeople in the short term by indirect\nmeans (this is in addition to the long\nterm risks of death from cancer).\nThe results come from a statistical\ncomparison of the state-by-state\nmortality figures and the measured\namounts of fall out in each area. Small\ndoses of fall out are normally difficult\nto measure, but the report found a clever way to make reliable\ncomparisons. Iodine-131 is a common\nradioactive component of fallout, and\niodine is concentrated in cow's milk.\nMeasurements of the amounts in milk\nare routine and they give a reliable\nindication of the amount of fall out in\nthe area where the cows graze.\nBetween May and August 1986 (the\nthree months following the reactor's explosion) the death rate showed an\nunexpected glitch. Normally about\n650,000 people die during these\nmonths in the USA. After Chernobyl\nabout 690,000 people died, that is,\nabout 40,000 (forty-thousand) more\nthan expected. The result is\nsignificant because the figures have\nshown remarkable stability since the\nbeginning of the century: such a large\nglitch is completely unprecedented.\nNormally the figures would be\nregarded as a meaningless\ncoincidence because the actual\nradiation doses are so small. Such\nsmall doses were previously thought\nto cause only marginal increases in\ndeath rates (from cancer) and these\nwould not show up for decades. But,\nthe measured radiation doses in milk\noccur in the same states as the\nunexpectedly large body counts.\nStates with low doses of Chernobyl's muck show normal death rates. So,\nthey cannot be ignored as a quirk of\nUNDER THE MICRO g jSC QP E by Steve Black\nthe Grim Reaper.\nHowever, 40,000 Americans did\nnot kick the bucket from radiation\npoisoning, or indeed from anything\nthat is normally connected with\nradiation. The theory that is gaining\npopularity is this: the most easily\nradiation-damaged part of the body is\nthe immune system; even small doses\nof radioactive nas ties cause small\ndecreases in the body's ability to fight\noff nasty invaders; so if people are ill\na small increase in the radiation dose\nmay be enough to make the difference\nbetween survival and death.\nSo we have to take the figures with\na pinch of salt: most of the people\nwho died were probably not healthy\nfit individuals who were suddenly\nstruck down by Russian fallout. Most\nwere ill people who were just tipped\nover the edge by the small decrease\nin their ability to kill bugs. It is\nmeaningless to say that any specific\nindividual died because of the fallout;\nthe effect only becomes obvious in\nlarge populations. Nevertheless, no\none ever imagined that such small\ndoses of radiation could cause such\na large secondary effect.\nThe number of deaths caused by the\ndisaster is likely to be very much\nlarger than anyone thought likely at\nthe time (if the results are confirmed\nin European work). The study is\nreminiscent of the one that showed a small, but perceptible corre ll ation between exposure of pregnant women\nto X rays and deformed babies. That\nreport led to tight restrictions on the\nuse of X rays in medicine. It is, as\nyet, impossible to say what will\nhappen as a result of the latest figures,\nbut it isn't going to be good for the\nnuclear industry, civil or military.\nIn twenty years time we may be\nthankful for Chernobyl. It may prove\nto be the only thing that will convince\nus just how dangerous our nuclear\nplaythings are. We have to learn that\nlesson now and start to look for safer\nways of defending ourselves and\nkeeping our light bulbs glowing.\nSex\nand the\nsingle\ninsect\nChemical warfare is banned under the\nGeneva Convention. But the Geneva\nConvention convention only applies\nto people. This leaves the world's chemical companies free to engage in\na continuous and fearsome ly nasty\nwar against creepy-crawlies.\nThe big problem in this war is\nselectivity: we could kill our insect\nenemies with the same things we are\nnot allowed to use on our human\nenemies (phosgene, chlorine, t aubin, hydrogen cyanide...), but we would\nkill lots of friendly people as well, and\nthis is considered rather\ncounterproductive by the agricultural\nprofession (though it might just solve\nsome of the EEC's problems with\nfarming subsidies).\nThe first big breakthrough was the\ndiscovery of DDT. It killed almost\nanything with too many legs and\nproved to be nearly harmless to\npeople. Unfortunately, it is really\ninert chemically and so sticks around\nin the environment, enabling resistant\nstrains of insect to develop. Also, it\nkills birds and fish, which we would\nrather kill by other means so we can\neat them.\nPyrethroids were the next really big\nbreakthrough. Some British\ngovernment chemists borrowed the\nbasic chemicals from some plants who\nhad been engaged in their own war\nagainst insects for eons, and then\nimproved them to make them more\neffective. They are much more\nselective than DDT: you can spray a room with them killing all the flies but\nnot your pet cat. The lethal doses are\nsmall and the compounds do not\naccumulate like DDT. But, they are\nstill rather un selective among insects\nand are not wholly harmless to the pet\nfish.\nNewer and better chemicals are on\nthe way, but it will always be\nextremely difficult to find a chemical\nweapon that kills just one type of\ninsect selectively. Ideally we want a chemical that can be used to kill things\nthat eat crops, but not useful insects,\nsuch as honeybees and crop\npollinators. However, a bit of lateral\nthinking has just produced some\nspectacular and completely specific\nresults in Egypt.\nTheir particular problem involves\nkilling Cotton Leaf Worm (which\ndestroys cotton crops) without killing\nHoneybees (which produce a valuable\ncrop in their own right). The trick that\nproduces specific results, is to use the\ninsects own sex pheromones against\nit. Pheromones are the chemicals\ninsects use to find each other when\nthey are randy and want to start a family (in this case female\npheromones attract the male insects).\nThey are completely insect specific\n(after all God does not want to\nencourage unnatural acts between\ndifferent types of insect, does he?).\nChemists can identify and reproduce\nthe pheromones in large quantities.\nThe first attempt to control the\ninsects involved using the\npheromones to attract male insects\ninto a trap. However, this failed\nbecause the small number of males\navoiding the traps were enough to\nkeep the population going. After an\namazing lateral thinking leap, the\nscientists tried a better method that\nworked: they saturated the cotton crop\nwith the pheromone. This,\npresumably, drove the male flies into\nan orgy of randy ness, but. more\nimportantly, left them completely\nunable to find the females (not so\nmuch because the small amount of\nfemale scent was drowned by the\nartificial variety, making it impossible\nfor the males to smell out the\nfemales).\nThis, of course, left the population\ndevastated after one generation. More\nimportantly, it had no effect on the\nbees (or any other insects for that\nmatter), thus producing a bumper\nhoney harvest.\nThe side-effects of DDT left\nchemistry with a tarnished image, but\nthese latest developments show that\nChemists may be near to redeeming\nthemselves. A healthy respect for the\nbalance of nature is not, after all,\nincompatible with the chemical\nindustry.\nFriday January 15th1988 FELIX\n\n"

The\nmistake was discovered when two Canadian students from Montpelier\nHall came to collect items from the Linstead Hall basement where they\nhad left them for safe-keeping and discovered they were gone. Four\npeople have since come forward claiming that their possessions have\nalso disappeared.\nFive years ago the Students Residence\nCommittee decided that the Linstead\nBasement area would be the only area\nin College where property could be\nleft for a long term period. Since then\nmore and more items ac cum mula ted and it was not obvious to whom they\nbelonged. At the beginning of this\nacademic year the Linstead Hall\nConvenor Martin Whitfield suggested\nthat the area should be cleared and\nany unwanted property sold. The Hall\nWarden Richard Clarke was in favour\nand the Hall Committee agreed to\nhelp.\nThree notices were put in FELIX\nto announce the decision and\nimpending sale of any goods which\nhad not been clearly marked with\nname and department.\nThe Basement was closed on 2nd December and the Committee spent\nthree days sorting out what could and\ncould not be sold. Dr Clarke told\nFELIX that anything which was not\nmarked was opened and if it was good\nit was put aside for sale by auction.\nHe said that the whole operation was\nmonitored by the sub wardens. It was\ndecided to donate all the clothes to\nOxfam as there were sufficient other\ngoods to make a sale worthwhile.\nThey also found three televisions,\nthree stereos, ski boots, a windsurfing\noutfit, a computer and three bicycles.\nThe sale took place on the\nfollowing Saturday and made\n\u00a31123.935 with the proceeds being\nsplit between the Hall and the RNLI.\nDr Clarke said that the Hall would be\nusing the money to finance the Hall's20 th birthday party in March.\nIt was shortly after this that people\nstarted to realise that personal\npossessions had also been sold,\nincluding items from boxes which had\nbeen marked with peoples' names and\ndepartments. One women claims to\nhave lost \u00a33000 worth of skiing\nequipment while others have lost\nrecords and important lab books.\nDr Clarke apologised for the losses\nbut said that it was 'inevitable with\nsuch an exercise.' He has also\npromised to examine each case and\nhas asked for all the students affected\nto put their stories down in a letter.\nMartin Whitfield, in a written\nreport, said that he believed that the\nsale had been a great success and was\na long time in coming. He also wishes\nto see such a sale held every year. He\nwrites, 'as with anything that is done,\nsome people will get hurt and lose\nsome of their possessions. But the sort\nout of the basement occured with\nevery reasonable effort being taken to\nlocate the owners of most of the\nvaluable items. If any article was not\nproperly labelled, i.e. Name,\ndepartment, year it was left, date of\ncollection, it was then opened. If it\nwas obvious that the total worth of the\narticles was high then their name\nwould be checked against the College\nlist and if the name didn't appear, the\narticles were then sold or thrown out.\nIn my opinion if the people who did\nlose belongings in the sale had taken\nmore care of their possessions in the\nfirst place, they wouldn't now have\nlost them. Hopefully it will teach\nthem that if they can't be bothered to\neven label them properly, why should\nthe Hall look after them, when all they\nare doing is cluttering up the Hall's basement which is to be used\nprimarily for the Hall's residents and\nnot as a potential fire hazard which\nit was before the clear out was\nstarted.'\nThe Union is to take up the cause\nof the students who have lost their\npossessions. President Ian Howgate\nhas described the situation as 'a complete mess'. He said yesterday\nthat the whole thing is a shambles,\nbecause proper records had not been\nkept of the items in the basement by\nLinstead Hall security. They have a list of names and departments of\npeople who have gained entry to the\nbasement in the last five years, but\nthey are concerned that students were\nnot informed by security that they\nshould put name,'department and date\nto be collected on any boxes left there.\nCollege administration have stated\nthat College will not be held liable,\nwhich means that people who have\nlost items will not be reimbursed.\nHowever, the Union is trying to\ncompile a list of people whose\npossessions have been sold.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

    "content": "I found Christmas really depressing\nthis year. The endless reunion parties\nwith old school friends who were still\ndrinking too much and smoking too\nmuch. I think it depressed me because\nI started to realise that I had somehow\ngrown away from the people I used\nto hang around with. I no longer\nwanted to party into the night, drink\ntoo much or smoke too much. I put\nthis down to being Tmperialised',\nthough my old friends just said\n'boring'.\nI don't consider myself boring. It's those eggheads that sit in the front\nrow and know all the right questions\nto ask that are. I'm just more\nconfident than I used to be since\ncoming to university. I don't feel that\nI have to pretend anymore when I go\nto a party. I 've never really liked them\nall that much, or discos, come to that.\nThe parties of my formative years\nconsisted of spiked orange juices and\nthrowing up in the kitchen. I could\nnever understand why I let myself go\nthrough that same old Friday night\nritual. I could sit for hours in the same\narmchair, with a fixed grin and\nobligatory gin & tonic, watching them\nchatting up girls with nervous giggles\nand 34a busts. I would feel my week-long inhibitions floating away as the\nwall fixtures began to rotate\nmysteriously and I would have an\ninexplicable urge to visit a bucket.\nDiscos are worse. One evening\nover Christmas my best friend at\nschool and his latest girlfriend Sue\ninsisted that we should go to\n'Grooving' in Hainsham. Sue\npromised that this newly-opened\nnightclub would make the ideal\nevening out. So I spent the. evening\nwith my obligatory gin & tonic,\nwatching heaving, sweating bodies\ngyrating mindlessly to mindless pop.\nThe charts are full this dross\nnowadays. I suppose it's because the\nonly people who can afford to buy\nsingles in 88 are those that run the\ndamned discos. It only takes 20,000\nsales and you've made it. Radio One\nonly makes it worse. I get really\nirritated when I find myself singing\nalong to it. I don't want to. I 've found\nmyself brainwashed by the\nbackground music and the backside\nchatter.\nI must admit that Christmas wasn't just a string of parties and family get\ntogether s.I did meet some people that\nI hadn't seen since school. I was\nshocked to discover how many of my\ncontemporaries had got engaged since\nthen, and one had been married for\nfive months! I 'll soon be the only\nbachelor in Hainsham. This doesn't worry me that much because I intend\nto make the most of being single.\nI think the best thing that happened\nto me at Christmas was EastEnders.\nIt's suddenly got really good again.\nI 've managed to miss both of this\nweek's episodes but I plan to catch\nthem on Sunday.

    "content": "As citi c News Welfare worries ULU Welfare Handbooks, intended\nfor first year students in October, are\nstill collecting dust in the Union\nOffice. Union President Ian Howgate\nand Union Welfare Officer Pippa\nSalmon have blamed this on the\nUniversity of London Union who\nproduced it and apathy in the Union.\nLast year's Union Welfare\nCommittee took the decision not to\nproduce 'But Were Afraid To Ask',\nthe ICU Welfare Handbook, but to\ntake 2000 copies of the new UL U Welfare Handbook instead. These\nwere intended to be distributed at the\nFreshers' Reception as 'But Were\nAfraid To Ask' had been done\npreviously. However, the booklets\ndid not arrive until the third week of\nthe Autumn Term, too late for the\nReception, after a series of mix-ups\nat the University of London Union.\nMs Salmon siad that the ideal\nsolution would be to get stickers and\nnames from Registry in order to\ndistribute the booklets to the\ndepartments but she felt that there\nr It's the Year of the Dragon!\nDiscover China in '88...\nBeijing \u00a3456 m Hong Kong \u00a3456 \u00ab\nand all around Asia\nThailand \u00a3345\nMalaysia \u00a3420 \u00ab\nIndia \u00a3375 \u201e\u201e\nBook now before it's too late!\nfor low cost worldwide flights, tours, holidays and expert advice for the independent traveller. Special fares\n\u201e for students\nand academics\nAsk for our brochures \u2014\nsee how lar you can go!\nUl U travel ULU Travel\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nPrince Consort Road\nLONDON SW7\nEnquiries and Bookings: pn\nEuropean 0\n1\n*\n5\n8\n1 8233\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nA service of\nS ff ii TheWorldbeaters\nIMC\nwould not be the support to help her\ndo this and that she did not have the\ntime to do this all herself.\nMr Howgate does not believe that\nthey are worth distributing at this late\nstage and is particularly annoyed with\nULU. 'The Handbooks were 8-9\nweeks late and they were definitely\nnot as good as But Were Afraid To\nAsk.' He is not worried that first\nyears missed out on the welfare\nliterature this year because it was\nwell-covered in the ICU Handbook\nwhich Ms Salmon edited.\nMs Salmon still hopes to persuade\ndepartmental senior tutors to take on\nthe distribution but until then they will\nbe collecting the dust in the Union\nOffice. She said yesterday 'it's a great\nshame that the first years didn't get\nthe Handbooks when they arrived,\nwhen they probably needed them\nmost. Ian spent a lot of time chasing\nULU up about it. I don't think we\ncould have done anything else once\nwe were committed to the UL U book'.\nIt is almost certain that the Welfare\nCommittee will decide to return to\n'But Were Afraid To Ask' for the\ncoming year's intake.\n0 RS awards\nThere will be 800 new Overseas\nResearch Students Awards this year\nin the United Kingdom. They will be\noffered on a competitive basis to\noverseas postgraduate students of\noutstanding merit and research\npotential. Each award will cover the\ndifference between the tuition fee for\na home postgraduate and the full-cost\nfee they would have been expected to\npay as an overseas postgraduate\nstudent. Nine of these awards are\ntenable at IC. Further information can\nbe obtained from the Scholarships\nOffice, Room 314, Sherfield\nBuilding.\nObituary\nVernon Clancy MBE\nVernon St Clair Clancy has died aged\n82. One of College's most\ndistinguished alumni, he was a leading explosives expert and\ninvestigator of bomb-induced aircraft\ncrashes, his most recent being into the\nloss of the Air India Boeing 747 over\nthe Irish Sea in 1985. He leaves a wife\nand two daughters.\nExtra cash\nThe Union Snack Bar has been\nseriously affected by the illness of\nManager Norman Jardine. There is a severe shortage of casual workers\nespecially before midday and an\nappeal has been made for any\nstudents, who can spare a few hours\none morning and need extra cash, to\nhelp out.\nSmash V grab\nThe Union's Microcomputer Club\nwas broken into over the Christmas\nperiod and several vital bits of\nequipment were taken including a BBC micro and a keyboard. The job\nwas not professionally done as the\ndoor was broken open. Honorary\nSecretary Chas Jackson believes it to\nhave been carried out by an\nopportunist. This has put the Club out\nof action.\nInter-Rail\nJBritish Rail have decided to keep the\n'price of their Inter-Rail card at the\nsame price as last year, despite their\nrecent price increases in Great\nBritain. For \u00a3139, the card allows\ntravel throughout 20 European\ncountries and Morocco to all people\nunder 26. The price also includes\ndiscounts of up to 50% on a choice\nof cross-channel hovercraft and ferry\nservices.\nFlowers urged\nLondon University's trade unions\nhave urged former IC Rector and\ncurrent UL Vice Chancellor Lord\nFlowers to attend the House of Lords\nthroughout the debating of the\nEducation Reform Bill. They believe\nthat Lord Flowers should take a high-profile stand against the Bill and\nrepresent the feelings of all academics\nin the University.\nAdventure\nThe first National Outdoor Pursuits\nExhibition opens on Thursday March\n3 in Battersea Park, London for four\ndays. If you want to add a little\nadventure to your dull, dull life then\n;it's only \u00a31.50 to students.\nFELIX Friday January 15th19883 "

    "content": "\u2022 MYSTERIOUS THINGS have\nbeen afoot in Ye Olde Hamlet\nGardens. My spies inform me that\none of the new sub wardens has been\nnot-such-a good boy. One wonders if\nthe appointment was just jobs for the\nboys? Apparently he was just an\nordinary resident of Hamlet last term\nand certain people claim to have\ncompiled a damning list of all his\nmis demean ours which shows him in\na most unsuitable light and would\nhave easily taken up this whole page.\nUnfortunately said sub warden let\nhimself into my spies' flat, found the\nlist and destroyed it. Luckily they\nhave promised that I can have all the\ndirt in the very near future.\n\u2022 THE NEW WARDEN of Holbein\nHouse has arrived, much to the relief\nof weary College d is ipl in arians, who\nbelieve him to be the answer to their\nprayers. The residents, however,\ndon't seem to thrilled with this new\nCollege messiah. There are now no\nwashing machines and a cooker has\nalso been removed. We recommend\nthat you take a clothes peg with you\nwhen you visit friends in Holbein.\nCollege are sticking by their man: he\nhas also managed to remove all the\nshopping trolleys, road cones and\nFOR SALE signs from the premises.\nIt is also rumoured that he has the\ndish i est wife to have tant ali sed celibate Evelyn Gardens residents\nsince Tony Aston left Willis Jackson.\n\u2022 NEW BOY Reggie with the\nunpronounceable surname took on the\nUnion finance system at the beginning\nof the year only to find that he was\nwithout an office, desk or even chair.\nAccording to my source, it was\nDeputy President Alan Rose's job to\nfix Reggie up with the necessary\nequipment for running the Union but\nAlan went to Malta and seems to have\nleft all his motivation in the sun.\n\u2022 IC RADIO hacks and hackett es have been amusing themselves with\na tale about Station Manager Steve\nGutteridge and old-timer John Allen.\nA small reward to anybody who is\nprepared to reveal the reason behind\nthe merriment because it smells like\nscandal to me.\nBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr went Derek's alarm clock. Derek looked at it\nsleepily and mumbled 'the big\nhand's pointing at the five and the\nlittle hand's midway between the\neight and the nine; that means\nit's... err...it's... err'. 'Eight twenty-five, dear' said Derek's wife Mad\nDash, 'time for work'. (Derek was\nthe Baron of Cheapskate and part\ntime actor on Channel 4 when the\nmoney got a bit short.)\nDerek leapt out of bed and\nhurriedly got dressed. This was\ngoing fine until he came to the tie.\nHe didn't have time to ask Mad Dash to do it for him so he selected\nhis newest and nicest clip on. It was extremely wide and extremely\nloud but no one ever had the guts to tell him so to his face so\nhe didn't know how awful it looked. When he'd finished he picked\nup his new filo fax and rushed out of the front door. He didn't have\ntime for breakfast, but that wasn'ta problem, he would get\nMcNorthey to bring up something from the Quite Tasty Burger\nFactory to his office later. People often bring up things from the\nQuite Tasty Burger Factory.\nDerek reached his office on the top floor of the Surefield fortress\njust as his brand new digital watch beeped for eight-thirty. As he\nsettled into his luxury reclining chair and continued reading the\nlatest addition to his library (Ladybird book 7C) he wondered what\nall the fuss was about. The citizens were w hinge ing for no good\nreason yet again. If he, Derek the Baron, could get to his office\nby half past eight then why shouldn't all the citizens get to\nCheapskate at the same time.\nThe problem was that there weren't enough torture chambers\nat Cheapskate so Derek had decided that tortures should start an\nhour earlier. This might have been bad news for the citizens but\nit was even worse news for the torturers, most of whom lived\neven further from Cheapskate than the citizens.\nIt's not as if they do anything useful between half eight and\nhalf nine, thought Derek, now if they read a quality paper or the\nWest End theatre listings then things might be different....\nAnyway, this was all good complaining practice for the leading\ncitizens as they prepared for the Cheapskate General Election at\nthe end of term. No one was quite sure who was going to stand\nfor the posts of Head Citizen, Deputy Head Citizen, Phallix Editor\nand...the other one, but some citizens had started (continued ?)\nto act very strangely and very secretively as they strove to get\nsome all important publicity. Some of them were even seen in the\nPhallix Office trying to achieve the ultimate hack credibility of\nappearing in the 'Duke of Sluicegate'...\nMeanwhile in the citizen's office the winners (losers) of last\nyears elections had returned from their Christmas break.\nWhygate was contemplating about holidays. How was it that\nhis Deputy, Alan Ego, could go to Malta and the Phallix Editor,\nJudith Largeamounts, go skiing in France when all he managed\nwas a few days with some amateur hairdressers in Guildford. It\nwasn't fair, but then life in Cheapskate never was.\nWill Whygate go on a proper holiday?\nWho will stand in the Cheapskate General Election?\nWhat has happened to the 3 clowns?\nDoes the bookshop sell Coles Notes to Ladybird Book 7C? Find out in the next episode of the Baron of Cheapskate\n\u2022 THE LANDLORD of the\nCat'n 'Fiddle in Holborn is to receive\na shock this week when he gets a writ\nfrom Union President Ian Howgate.\nIt appears that the deranged man\nattempted to disco dance down the\nsteps to the basement bar and slipped,\nbreaking his right thumb in two\nplaces. He has instructed the Union\nsolicitor to sue for the partial loss of\nhis services to the Union for the next\ncouple of months, since he now\ncannot write with that hand. Damages\nare expected to run into tens of pence.\n\u2022 THOSE GLORIOUS Guildsmen\nhave managed another winner. They\nheld an legged pub crawl earlier this\nweek. Problem was that nobody got\nthe message about what terrific fun\nit would be to do this wacky stunt.\nNever mind. For all mathematicians,\nn=9 where n tends to HackSoc.\n\u2022 WHOLESCALE CONFUSION\nreigned in the IC Union Office this\nweek when Deputy President Alan\nRose swapped offices with Union\nAdministrator Jen Hardy-Smith and\nneglected to tell anybody. Union\nofficers have quipped that they\nthought their demented DP had had\nhis hair re styled and taken to wearing\ntasteful skirts and blouses.\n\u2022 MY EARS ALWAYS prick up\nwhen I hear the word scandal. Most\nof it is either unrepeatable or concerns\nvarious sabbaticals that have severe\ndifficulty doing their jobs properly.\nDespite strong words at the last\nCouncil, Honorary Secretary Chas\nJackson has been doing his best to do\nhis worst. My favourite instances of\nthis curious phenomenon revolve\naround Christmas cards and\ninsurance.\nIt is rumoured that Mr Jackson was\ngiven 45 cards to post at the end of\nlast term on behalf of the Union and\ndidn't. It was left up to Receptionist\nKathy Tait to send them after they had\nbeen ingeniously date-stamped\n13/12/87 last week.\nMole Higgs has enhanced his Hon\nSec 88/9 credibility by sorting out all\nthe insurance claims which Chas had\nneglected.\n\u2022 CAN NIGEL WHITFIELD ,\nboyish IC Radio News Editor, live\nwithout the phone? The poor boy\nobviously needs the substitute while\nhero Pete Hands is working hundreds\nof miles away. And why does Pete\nhave a double bed? Nigel claims that\nits just wishful thinking.\nChris Jones\nFELIX Friday January 15th19887 "
