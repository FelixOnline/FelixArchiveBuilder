    "content": "2 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR1 LIVING LOCALLY'\nSir The editorial writer of the last FELIX has ob-vio us ly lived all his( I.C.) life in the hostel. I have on several occasions roamed up and down King's Ed., Fulham Rd. and Earls Court Rd. and studied the\nKensington Post looking for digs under 40/- within walking distance of College. There are some but\nthey are invariably of a very poor quality. Nor\ncan much help in t:is respect be obtained from Miss Ehir law. The rooms which are available further out\nare superior and not only in the kind of attention obtained from the landladies. I agree, it is not\ndifficult to find accommodation in Queen's Gate Terrace, but we have not all got private incomes.\nYours,, etc., K.G.9.3.51.( The writer of last week's editorial, and another member of the FELIX board both recently obtained rooms,at 30/- weekly, within a stone's throw of the college. Cheap rooms are not al ways advertised but they can be found with a little enterprise. Ed.)\nTHE SATURDAY HOPS\nSirI. C. Hops are in a distressing plight and\nsteps must be taken to correct this state of affairs immediately. This weekly cattle market, wh ifl his so bad that one thinks twice before inviting af rie nd, is attracting large numbers of casual 'guests',\nresults in a female attendance of low quality( be-cause the better types will not come) and is giving the college a bad name. These factors, together\nwith such minor ones as the impossibility of dancing after8.45 and the difficulty experienced in buying even a lemonade without a15 minute wait, make these Hops incompatible with the dignity of a oo lle ge such as I.C., and it is imperative that something be done to improve matters. I would suggest as a solution that the number\nof women attending the Hops should be out by a quart er. This would have the effect of re duo ing the\nnumber of casual 'guests' and (probably) the attendance from I.C., and would definitely improve the\nstandard of da no ing and behaviour. This out might\nbe hard to enforce but a start could be made by\nsending to some of the relevant training colleges a notice cancelling the general invitation issued at the beginning of the Session. Alternatively, the admittance of women might be by . invitation on-ly, except, say, for some 25jt to keep a reasonable\nbalance. A more distasteful method - a perhaps\nthe only practicable one - would be to raise the\nprice of entry. Yours faithfully, D.R. Twist.\nSir Who are the people who complain about the\ngoings on in the Upper Dining Hall on Saturday\nnights? I maintain that it is a very fine institution in that, at all times (20.00 - t2330} the\npossibilities for dancing are greater in the U.D. H. than in the Gym and further, the floor is better. At a hop, you will always find me in the U.D. H. for that reason. It is true that one can generally observe a couple spooning in the darker corners. So\nwhat? It does not worry me and I assure you, I do\nnot worry them. Why should anybody be offended by\nthese couples? Is it, perhaps, a question of sour\ngrapes?\nYours, etc. K. Graupner\n(Chem.

The sight of dusty\nstacks of gymnastic apparatus, abandoned kit and\nstuffed heads must be extremely un savoury t of re qu ent users of the rooms like myself. In the shower\nroom, the foot boards are waterlogged and rotten, the wash-basin is stained and chipped, and the walls are be spattered with mud.

I feel sure that you mj tst know of someone who\nwould be willing to help me, and the many like me\nwho feel quite bereft of comfort and advice. Yours hopefully, Joe.\n( I.C.

    "content": "\u2022 FELIX SPORT I.C BULLY VETS\nUL HOCKEY CUP HELD\nI.C5 Royal Vets.1 This match was played at Mo3pur Park, and I.C. won convincingly; but the Vets, p ttt up a grand\nfight, and indeed had the better of a goalless first half. Defence has been our strongest point for the\npast two years - as is borne out by the bare two\nge als scored against us in the last nine cup games -and it was the defence that was severely tested in the first half. Just es en and Palmer rose manfully to the occasion, supported by Pike who played a' blinder' throughout the match. The rot of 'cup-nerves' was stopped, but not before Hardy had made\nseveral fine saves and the st ect at or s' nerves had\nhad a severe testing. By halftime the halves had found their feet, and after halftime the boys\nwent to town, in no uncertain manner. How the half line, Pike, Bennett and Mossman, served their forwards with a series of quick, hard and accurate passes, concentrating on the left, since Green was\nour most dangerous forward. Purslow on the right wing had a rather scanty service but did some use-ful work, in support. George and Jones played a skilful and unselfish game, backing up Bentley and\nGreen, and continually feeding them with short\npasses. The scoring was opened after a short co rner had been awarded against a Vets, defender for pushing a possible scoring shot out with his hand:\nBennett hit a low s creamer from the corner hit, and\nhad the Vets, goalie beaten all ends up. Only a minute or two later Green scored one of his 'spec-i ali ty' goals. He ran in from the left, drew the\ngoalie, and lofted the ball nonchalantly under the\nRUG GER RCS. 3. C&G.0. RCS. narrowly defeated the C&G. by a penalty goal in the second match of the inter oo lle ge series for the new \"Sparkes\" Cup.\nRCS. kicked off against a strong wind,\nand the first ten minutes were fought out in their'25'. C&G. were very close to taking the lead with three attempts to kick penalty goals. After several anxious moments, RCS. managed to for o efl h li lds back towards their goal line. After hammering away for several minutes RCS. were awarded a penalty, S. Coppleman landing a fine goal from an\nawkward position and against a difficult wind.\nRCS. gained heart from this fine effort and the\ntackling of their three quarters became especially good. This proved to be the only score of the game,\nalthough lapin, the Guilds full back, was very un-fortunate to see yet another attempt to kick a pena l ty goal hit the upright. The forward play was fairly even, though\nthe RCS. were superior in tights c rummaging, but\nWere beaten in the line out s by the taller Guilds men.\nR.C.S.3 R.S. M. The annual fixture between R.S. M. and R.C.S., having been postponed due to rain, was played at\nH arlington on Monday, March 12th. Play throughout the game was rather scrappy,\nand there were numerous penalties awarded against1 \u00bbth sides. The Mines missed chances to score on three occ aei on a in the first ten minutes, when they were awarded penalties within the R.C.S.25. R.C.S. were\nunfortunate in losing M. Holman with an ankle injury, tout he was able tote turn after medical attention.&. C.S. were only awarded one penalty within kicking Instance of the Mines goal, and Ellis, the full back,\na on fl dent ly scores3 points to give R.C.S. the lead. There was no further score in the first half. The\nforward play was fairly even, although far from polished, and neither set of three quarters had much\nof the ball. In the second half, play fluctuated from end\nto end, and Mines lost an opportunity to draw level DV missing a very easy penalty in front of the posts. The result, after this, was never i a doubt, even when\nl.CS. lost CM. Wilson with vet another ankle injury.\n(Continued In next column)\nbar into the net. Bentley scored the remaining\nthree; one from a penalty bully, another through\na second infringement. The last goal was a classic \"shot across the goal keeper's bows, cushioning off the post into the net.\nVets never gave up the struggle and indeed\nstaged a fine rally, aided by some rather lighthearted fly hitting by the I.C. backs; the Vets\ngoal was well deserved, but it was too late to save\nthe day. I.C. were victorious, and retained the\nrather depressing looking rose-bowl for a second\nyear.

Gliding Club, and in that time it lias achi ev ed a considerable status in the\ngliding world, helped to a large extent by its close association with the Surrey G.C. an association rather similar to that between I. C.B.C. and Thames R.C. The 21st Anniversary dinner was held in Ayrton Ball on Saturday, 3rd March, the Staff Common Room\nhaving been made available for the reception. The\nClub had put in an incredible amount of work in hiding the work of the builders and in decorating the hall, and the result was very pleasing. The\nHector welcomed the guests' at the reception, and a prodigious amount of sherry met its fate before we\nsat down to the excellent four course dinner, with white and red wines (the wine bill showed an average\nof half a bottle a head), port and oi gars( for the\nprivileged). Speeches by the Rector, Sir Frederick Kandley Page, Sir David Brunt, Son Mac fie( the capt a in),2.C. Gordon England, R.S. Colquhoun, and\nPhilip'.'/ ills were all excellent, but they obviously cannot be reported here.( A full report appears in 'The Aeroplane' of9 th March) We might perhaps record, as our more august contemporary does not, that when Mr. Gordon England mentioned \"the flaming torch of British. gliding\",' his point was promptly illustrated with a paper napkin, and the pin that was heard to drop in Hon Mae fie' s spee oh was in fact a6 inch nail' from the roof. The remark that won universal approval, however, was Sir Frederick's that a21 st party was the time forgetting tight.'./ hen the dinner was over and the important guests departed, the Club took Sir Frederick's adv ice and, with the aid of a piano and much beer,\nrendered the night hideous into the small hours.\nONE YEAR WALK TO GET HOME CIGARETTES* Strike out wh i oh not applicable.\nHYPNOTISM Hypnotism is still regarded sceptically by\nmany people. The power of hypnosis has been known\nfor thousands of years to priests,' mira ole' heal-ers, tribal witch doctors and the like, and pra otis ed with considerable success,though with little knowledge of the scientific principles involved. Hypnotism is derived from tine Greek word tir vs u*( hypnos, sleep). When hypnotised, the conscious mind is put to sleep. When this happens, the sub-conscious mind will respond to almost any commands\nand suggestions made to it. Everybody has experienced the phenomenon of waking up at a particular time In the morning simply by reminding himself the\nnight before that he has to wake up at that time. This is entirely due to the reaction of the sub-conscious mind to self hypnosis for that is all it is. It is not proposed to enter into the various methods of hy p not is inga person, since this can\nbe gleaned from demonstrations and books ( e.g. R.S later' s 'Hypnotism and Self Hypnosis', Gh. 5).\n(H.B. It is not necessary to have a) a swinging light held just above eye level, b)a man with a dominant will, coupled with beady black eyes and\nwaving hands), Any willing subject can. be hypnotised by almost anybody and in a very short, time. However, our main concern is the practical benefits to be gained from hypnotic and post-hypnotic suggestion. Three outstanding applications immediately spring to mind.\na) Amnesia\nb) Calibrating real moral standards\nc) Material gain. a) The advantages of this form of am nes is and ana es the sia are already well-known and are being app-lied more and more extensively to dentistry, childbirth and operations etc. b) This second application has become necessary through the increasing dependance of moral behaviour on social convention. The method depends on the\n( empirical) first law of Hypnotics, that nobody,\nwhen hypnotised, will do anything against his or her\nmoral or religious principles, so that a series of\ntests can be arranged in which the subject is made\nto obey various commands. By this method, the\nsuitability of a male door keeper in a womans'\nhostel could be determined accurately. c) The third application is one of the most outs tan ding interest to stm dents. First of all, let it be explained, that when under the spell of the\nhypnotist a subject will obey any command or res pond to any suggestion Riven by the hypnotist with the exception of Law 1. Further, if given a post hypnotic suggestion while still asleep, that he will experience such and s uch a thing when he wakes up\nand will do such a thing at being given a particular signal, he will do these things until told not to by the hypnotist. The author has actually seen\nfour initially sober men reduced to complete a J co h'oli c bliss by drinking from a glass containing nothing whatever, in a recent demonstration by Ralph\nSlater. Thus it is not difficult to foresee the\ntime when a party can remain in an advanced state of in sobriety for an entire evening,the only expense being drinks for the hypnotist. Another material use of hypnotism, oi gh t wen be in alleviating the strain of examinations.( N.B. Mo research has been done yet in imposing the com\nple te syllabus of a course on the subconscious mind\nof a candidate before an examination). Hot long ago, a group of Cambridge ( all right, all right,) students were given post hypnotic suggestions that they would be bursting with confidence when the\ngreat day came, and that all the things they had\nswot ted up would come easily and clearly to them,\netc. They were all men usually prone to failing exams, through( perhaps) nervousness; and, need-less; to say, they all did magnificently. The vast fields for research revealed i by these\nfew ideas exposes the urgent need for a brand, new\ncourse at I.C. that of Hypnotist ry. G.H.S.

An eminent sportswoman, she is also a gifted conversationalist and although no feminist, has, as certain members of the rug ger club know only too well, a rough side to her tongue when the peace\nof the I.C.'A'. A. residents is disturbed. June was born in April,1928 two months prematurely and had to be bathed in olive oil. Her pa rents with a foretaste of her own press on regardless attitude persisted in calling her June.\nAcademically she has risen from the Sudbourne\nRoad Junior Mixed to3 rd year Zoo at the R.C.S. Her determined spirit is shown by her finally passing Inter four years after Mat ric. She is now specialising in paras it ology( being but an ignorant engineer we unfortunately chose this point in the inter view to ask her if she had a cigarette, we now know\nthe meaning of paras it ology and that she doesn't smoke). She hopes to go on to research next year.\nHer rise in I. C.W. A. has been swift and steady:\nf re.; her rep., secretary and president. She was\nlast year's hockey captain and captain of the mixed\nteam. At netball she plays centre attack... hen asked what she likes doing best June gives a laugh reminiscent of Joy Nichols, but then says:\n\" Travelling\". This is mainly done on the continent by hitchhiking. She has a catholic taste in literature,, md leans to the classical in music. In her ow Qr words she drinks but not to excess.\nShe is5 ft.4 in. tall, takes size5 shoes and\nrefuses categorically to allow other measurements\nto be published.'\nIn general June gives the impression of a competent reserved personality nicely rounded by natural charm. I.C. and I. C.W. A. have been richer for her presence for three years and it, is to be\nhoped she will continue long to adorn is ur all but\nmonastic precincts. SCIENTIFIC HISTORY Professor Levy's lectures on 'The History of Science' began with discussion of how we ought to approach the history, and the Professor drew for us some ingenious diagrams showing that science and technology grew in a spiral. He hoped to be\nable to present the whole of his subject similarly in a scientific fashion. In his second lecture he dealt with the earliest civilizations, of Egypt and Babylonia, and\nshowed how they needed mathematics for their architecture. Thus the use of a few empirical laws\nwas developed. For instance, to solve the equation x*+x=1 they would have a table of values of x 'and x, and look through this to find a solution. The third lecture dealt with the beginnings\nof Greek civilization, and the development of a society dependent on slavery. Their\" attitude began to be 'why?' instead of 'how?'.These Greek\nthinkers were of two classes the Sophists and\nthe Pythagoreans. The Sophists believed that change ( in society) is essential, and then proved by\ningenious mathematical argument, that it was impossible, whilst the Pythagoreans started with the i dea that actuated change is impossible and proved\nthat it was essential. This crisis was only solved when Alexander led the Greeks into world dominance and the upheaval\nrequired a complete change of values'.\u2014I recommend\nyou to go. The lectures are held in the Main Lect ure Theatre of the Huxley Building.

On Saturday we entertained Cambridge and London Universities, and a Mast ers' team, which won the teams-of-four event com-fort ably. This was hardly surprising as their team\ncomprised M. Harisson Gray and Jock T arlo( the senior half of the British Bridge team) and two other Internationals, the Sharpies brothers. Although I.e. beat Cambridge convincingly in our match ei th them, they beat us into second place with a slightly better aggregate over the whole cont est. On Sunday, after the Congress proper had been\nopened by Mr. T arlo, Open Pairs and Teams events\nwere held. Representatives of nearly every London\nCollege competed for the prizes, which were presented by Mrs. Tar lo.G. W.S LIMBO ET JIE Recently a voluble character with Smutsian\nbeard and cold blue eyes was to be seen around the\nUnion, allowing all within earshot to benefit from\nhis colourful experience. Within a few hours of this South's African's arrival from Ireland( or Czechoslovakia or maybe it was Rur it ania) he had\nbeen gladly taken in('.) by 2 ex-students who live in a nearly flat. What a fund of anecdote there\nwas to be had - not of course that one notices the\nrapid emptying of one's pocket during the process.\nHe was a Journalist, cattle breeder, gold miner, merchant-seaman, companion of all the well known film characters and writers and above all a most convincing storyteller. With a little experience one could detect him weighing up a new\narrival before launching out on some new true experience which would culminate - maybe not until the next day - in a small loan ( until next week).\nHe was never one not to make himself at home;\nperhaps this is best illustrated by the way in which, having helped himself to a cigarette from\nanother resident's pocket, he closed the packet,\nhe then - profuse in apology for his un generosity re-opened the packet and offered it to its owner'.\nIn 3 short weeks, a cloud of bon homie and\nfantasy had been built round his head, much of it believable; under cover of this cloud atleast a dozen men had been fleeced of more than they\nwould ever invest in the Post Office and had\nreceived not one word and thanks l One of our\nlocal paupers still cannot understand how this happened, when for4 years he has not been able\nto scrounge even a beer from those same people.\nKnowing of course that an exception can never define a rule, some of us may be e \u00bbo used won-de ring why, the Empire having been flung so far, this particular piece should stick to one's fi ngers for so long.

Since his return in1948, and getting a2nd. in Finals, he has been in turn President of R.C.S., and now of I.C. Since Derek has been in this office he has\nbeen especially keen on fostering cooperation between the college and university Unions, and\nwe expect a special effort in this direction next\nyear.

At the last meeting of the Entertainments Ccar.it tee a resolution was passed recommending to I.C. Union\nCouncil that the Saturday night 'Hops' should be discontinued as from the end of this term.\nFor some time past the committee has felt that the situation was getting out of hand. Many comp la in ts have been received regarding the overwhelming numbers attending the 'hops', making dancing\ndifficult and leaving the Union so much the worse\nfor wear and tear. Comment is also widespread\nabout the \" Palais de Danse atmosphere\" which has\nbeen giving I.C.a bad name in university circles. The committee considered a number of schemes to remedy the situation. Some of these have already been tried. A rigorous check of Union Cards was\none of these moves; but this did not greatly improve matters owing to the large numbers of IC. men and their\" personal guests\" - these often self invited. Increasing the price of admission was\nconsidered and rejected on the grounds that it would\ndiscriminate unfairly against the more impecunious\namong us.\nWhen interviewed My. Halsey, Chairman of the\nEntertainments Committee said that it was felt that I.C. 'hops' had become too much of a habit amongst\nmembers of our own Union and of other colleges. In order to return to the friendly party atmosphere,\nonce the outstanding characteristic of the 'hops',\nit was thought necessary to have a clear break so\nthat a freshstart could be made next year.\nAt the time of going to press( Tuesday) it is not known what act ionI.C. Council will take as a result of the recommendation of the Entertainments Committee. However, when a similar motion was\nput to Co until by Mr. Peter Rayward earlier this year it was only narrowly defeated by eight votes\nto seven. Since then the Entertainments Committee\nconsider that the situation has deteriorated. t bouc bst The Touchstone weekend at Silwood on 1 0 - ll th. March discussed \"Broad-casting\", and the Speaker\nwas Sir Noel Ashbridge,\nTechnical Director of the\nB.B.C. On the Saturday, he\nstarted the meeting with an outline of the problems\nof purpose and programme-methods, avoiding more than\n\u00ab- \u2022 \u00bb the technical possibilities and limitations. In the\nevening he answered and\namplified questions, so\nthat on Sunday the meeting\nwas able to divide its in te rest into concentrations on\ntelevision and the purpose\nand power of sound broad-casting.

Affording as they do a unique opportunity for a weekly\nget together they represent to many the core of our\nsocial life. We are told that this core is rotten and are recommended to throw away our social apple\nand to await next year's new crop. Yet it is difficult to see how the Hops are to be reorganised. The popularity of the Hops is due in no small measure to the efficient running of them by'the Entertainments Committee. So long therefore as they a on tin ue to be so smoothly run the numbers will al ways be too great for the Gym and Upper Dining Hail Thus Council is presented with an apparently Insoluble problem, subject as we are to the limitations of our present Union buildings. Until the extensions are made to the Union the only alternative place to hold a dance is Ayrton Hall which at this moment is in the grip of an army of decorators. Rrgerding the \"atmosphere\" at the Hops, while\nagreeing that it leaves something to be desired, we\nfeel that D.R. Twist's remarks about the type of\nyou hg ladies coming to the Hops will be taken\nrather badly by the 70jt or so college women, most\nof them being from training colleges. Surely the\ntruth of the matter is that a relatively small num-ber, by their disregard of generally accepted stan dards, are jeo pardi sing the good name and future of our weekly gyrations. EASTER\nFish and Friday have common enough associations in the old world outside I.e., and thus it has been\na convenient custom for FELIX to rear his ugly young,\nmaking bones about it, on this day in alternate weeks.\nHowever this term's end threatened notre chit chat with an incomplete fortnight before the Easter Vac. Here was a pretty kettle of fish. But in this lay also the solution the Refectory serves\nfish on Tuesday!\nHence, in a flurry of fur, this' ten day' FELIX\nhas been produced for Easter.: The Miners are going\nto Cornwall, the Editor is going to clean his cave,\nhis Assistant touring Swiss water-works, and I.C. students generally will do their first work since Christmas.

About 80 students and\nstaff attended. Mr. M.J. Merrick was in the chair and the motion was proposed by Mr- P.l'. Chettle. He\ncontended that at present the student is trained only for design and research, and is handicapped\nIn any other work. In particular he criticized tutorial periods as poor in not showing the full application of theory or putting into perspective the assumptions necessary for it. In this he com\npared us \"another place, in East Anglia\", where\ntutors of broad experience are available to each\nstudent.\nMr. Ted Hughes opened the opposition's case\nwith a reminder of the good reputation of I.C., and then outlined the present 3-year system, arguing that it provided reasonable technical and char\nact er training. He got good support for the prop os it ion that there is no need to do the course\nperfectly and that it is g pod experience to have\nthe choice between some of t he work and Union activity. The second er of the motion, Mr. G.A.Gs ll an, then went on to criticize in more detail; such as\ncourse-work experiments on obsolete equipment;the\nlack of a code of symbols, and the failure to coo rd in ate Lhe overlap of certain subjects. The\nsecond for the opposition, Mr- J. Fredericks fol lowed with some detail in turn. The first speaker from the floor argued that I.C. should not produce technical clerks the\nslide rule mechanics, but engineers as the pioneers of new applications of the forces of Nature.\nHe advocated a longer training period at College. The next speaker considered that the subject detail was no more important than that of students\nof the classics, whose work was designed solely to develop their minds. The next pointed out\nthat at I.C., the postgraduate year is a4 th year in the few subjects that need it, and that there by the 3-year basic system is extended only when\nrequired. Two speakers quoted their knowledge\nand experience of European and U.S. colleges, respectively. After the summaries ( during which something about \"broadening the bases of the brown\nbag gers\" was heard), the motion was defeated1527(10 abstentions).
