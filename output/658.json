    "content": "Spineless and\nwithout teeth\nCreepy\nletter\nRSMU Rants\nDear SitAs a member of R SMU1 would like to set the record\nstraight. As a union we are\ngetting extremely fed up with\nother groups at IC perpetuating\nthe image they think we should\nhave and promoting this tra vee sty with their propaganda\ncampaigns.\n: R SMU is an organisation\nwith no political leanings and\nfeels that a great deal of ICU timers being wasted on political\nissues which could be far better\nused on matters of direct\nconcern to students; after all,\nthat's what the Union is for. As\na Union we don't try to impress\nour views on others, so we don't see why others should try to\nforce us to conform to their\nvalues. There is no such thing as\nthe 'Mines block vote', no\nattempt is made to coerce\npeople into voting for a particular viewpoint at UGMs but\nwhat I will say is enough people\ncare about their Union to want\nto preserve its individuality and\nfreedom of expression.\nFinally I would like to voice\nmy disgust with the manner in\nwhich the 'anti pornography' vote was carried out. The\nmatter was handled so ineptly\nand the meeting had degenerated into such a shambles that I do not see how a fair account\ncould be obtained from the\npaper ballot.\nYours etc\nAlison B Mew\nA tit\nwrites\nDear Pallab\nI was appalled to read in the\nU GM report in Friday's FELIX that Neil Stewart\nliterally wiped the floor with the\nother speakers. Is it really\nnecessary for the NUS President to use such violent means\nto gain his ends?\nSecondly, I note that your\nfront page headline proclaims a 'Caption Competion' (sic). I'm glad to see there's nothing halfhearted about your campaign\nto ban tits from FELIX.( I thought I'd make an exception in\npublishing your letter-Ed.)\nYours sincerely\nMartin S Taylor\nFELIX Edtitor 1982/3\n(Surely some mist i take?

The fact that vacant\nUnion posts are not sufficiently\nadvertised makes the elections a mockery. The fact that ICU sabbaticals can get away with\ndoing bugger all makes the\nUnion a mockery and an insult\nto the student body, although\nmost students don't seem to\nmind this.\nI must admit that Ents are\nusually good, particularly\neven* organised by the CCUs,\nbut ICU's laudable claim to be\nnon-political seems to stretch to\nstudent politics and student\nrepresentation. We need good\nrepresentation if we are to avoid\nbeing trampled all over and we\nneed more students at UG Ms to\nstop them from being fiascos\nand to lend weight to any\nmotions passed.\nPlease come along to the next\nU GM, at the very least you'll\nget a chance to make a paper\naeroplane.\nLove and Kisses\nJO 'Shea\nEE1\nThe Bad\nDear Pallab\nI would like to start vicious/\ndelicious rumours about the\nreforming of the IC Social\nDemocratic Society.

Headlines on\npigeons and issues devoted\nalmost entirely to careers,\nworthy though they may be, are\nhardly your supposed style.\nEditorials on the Moonies,\nNUS etc aren't very original,\nneither are little personal digs at\npeople who have criticised you.\nWhat happened? Did the flabby\npansy threaten to sue you or\nsomething?\nMoving onto pastures new,\nwhy don't we have a few digs at\nthat paragon of cock-ups\u2014the\nCollege administration and\nother bureaucrats. For instance\nwhat was the real point of\nbuilding all that parking control rubbish? They haven't actually saved any money by\ngetting rid of any labour so it\nwas rather pointless to blow all\nthat money (\u00a310,000, \u00a315,000\nwhatever).\nWhy did they hire all that\nMeccano to go round Elec Eng\nand then leave it for six weeks,\nbuilding up a massive hire\ncharge? I 'll tell you: it was\nspecially done so that the\nworkmen could come in on\nMonday 3 October and cause\nmaximum noise and inconvenience to a maximum number of\npeople.

    "content": "Sport\nEDITORIAL\nSome of you may have thought that I'd cocked\nup again with the Canoe Club article about\nwater skiing. This was, infact, genuine, and the\nCanoe Club are taking up water skiing. Sailing vs UEA 2-0; UEA Ladies 1-0; UL2 1-0; UEA Old Boys 0-1\nOn Saturday the team travelled to Oulton\nBroads in East Anglia to take up the challenge of UEA.\nThe first race was sailed in a light and very\nshifty force 1 against the UEA old boys. The\nIC team made a good start but the old boy's superiority in Lards soon showed itself and\nImperial were struggling by the first mark.\nMatters did not improve in the remainder rr\nthe race and resulted in the Sailing Cub's first\naway defeat of the season.\nThe second race was sailed in similar cond i tins but this time the impressive UL2 were the\nopposition. Jones and Bennet-Clarke soon\ntalked their vessel into sailing faster than\neveryone else's and a lucky streak from\nHowarth saw IC with first and positions at\nthe first mark. Bevan in the meantime was\nseen trying to improve his tacking by leaping\nfrom one side of the boat to the other; needless to say at the back of the fleet. Positions\ndid not change until the last leg of the course\nwhen a surprise last minute attack from UL2\nwas heroically kept at bay by Jones. IC\nscraped home with '/2 of a point to spare.\nUEA were obviously not impressed with\nthe IC tactics and proposed a best-of-three\nrace series. However by this time IC had got\ntheir act together and in the first race sailed\nhome ahead of the entire UEA fleet. In the\nsecond race of the series, Kennedy sailed two\nof the UEA boats in the wrong direction\nsingle handed to give the remainder of the IC\nteam a clear starting line. Imperial cruised\nhome with 1st,2 nd and 5th. The UEA Ladies then had the audacity to\npropose a challenge. They were soon\nregretting their actions as Imperial left them\nstanding at the start. On seeing this Jones and\nBevan nobly decided to return to the start to\nmake more of a go of it. Even so Imperial\nproved too much for the girls to handle and\nsailed home in winning positions.\nMany thanks to UEA for a very enjoyable\nSaturday.\nPage72 H BH HH HI HH HI H HH HMM[ Gutteridge Cup 1st Round\nA magnificent display by IC saw QMC well\ntonk ed and thus they progress to the second\nround of the Cup competition where they will\nplay Guy's Hospital on 16 November.\nThanks to all the supporters who turned up\nwith crates of Swan and look forward to\nseeing you next Wednesday.\nAfter my little self-introduction to FELIX a couple of weeks ago, the table tennis committee have decided to submit weekly reports\nto enable us to complain about sports page\nquality in future issues.\nA quick resume of the season to date:\nTeam 1 are looking to relegation already.\nThey've only won 1 out of 6. However, their\nstar player NG is out with (chicken) pox at the\nmoment so they can only improve (?).\nTeam 2 collapsed like a prick-ed balloon.\nTeam 3 doing well! Won 3 out of 6.\nTeam 4 are settling down after the loss of\ntheir keystone (who me?). They've won 1 out\nof 5.\nTeam 5\u2014Erica's doing a grand job! They\nhave won 3 out of 5. Cor!\nNow, all you fresher s form team 5! If you\nstill want a game come up Wednesday afternoon and get onto Erica, the queues aren't so\nbig now.\nBye till next time.\nGraeme (Hon Sec)\nThe Volleyball Club has got off to a fresh\nstart this year. We have two men's teams, the\nsecond of which have won all of their two\nmatches!\nTeam 1. however, failed to win against the\nhighly praised ULU team, by a very small\nmargin (score was 3 sets to 2). The sole reason\nbeing, of course, that two of IC's best players\nwere actually on the other side of the net,*\nplaying for ULU! To compensate for this d is heartening experience, ICI had an easy victory over the London Fire Brigade team.\nThe Ladies' team, which is incidentally the\nfirst one in existence for a few years, is now\npractising regularly and the players hope to\nbring glory, honour and fame to IC, through\ntheir forthcoming matches! They had a friendly match against a very vicious looking\nULU team last week....Well, it was good\npractise anyway!\nA final note, to remind any forgetful club\nmembers, or anyone else interested in joining\nthe best IC club, on practise times: Tues 5:30-7:30pm Ladies; Wed l:305:30 pm Mixed; Sat\nl:303:30 pm Mixed and 3:30-5:30pm Ladies.\nOne cannot describe the emp hori c sense of\nteam spirit, not because the thirds are illiterate but because we won and the bar was\nopen afterwards.\nWe won 4-2!\nSpot the Ball Competition\nOur heroes were reduced to ten men at a very\nearly stage in the game by despicable intimidation from the Chem Eng thugs. Combined\nwith this, Matt Fawcett, our goalie and ace\nFELIX photographer suffered withdrawal\nsymptoms when a fiendish forward removed\nhis pet camera. After this, he didn't have to\nstop the ball hitting his camera and he lost his\nprevious motivation.\nCarl Burgess, News Ed and Centre Forward, was brutally crocked. Cramp, the\nChem fc ng centre forward scored their only\ngoal, as the rampaging FELIX heroes trampled all over their helpless victims. The final\nscore was 10-1 to FELIX. The Chem Eng\ncaptain said 'I'm as sick as a parrot! It was a good job Pallab and John Scott weren't play-ing, or we'd have conceded 30!''\nI Friday, 18 November, 19831\nTop of the League! Thats our position after\nwe thrashed Guys Hospital on 7 Nov. As\nnewcomers to the League Guys felt they had\nan easy first match against last year's holders\nof the wooden spp on. Ha!\nThey had not chance with the scoring of\nAlex 'Superhog' Mackenzie (28 points), the\nrebounding power of Big George Droungas\nthe speed of Scott 'The Yank' Broderic, the\ncoolness of Ken 'Iceman' Jarret and strong\nperformances from the rest of the team all\nbrought together by our star coach 'H'. Well,\nI rest my case! (Guiltyl-Sports Ed.)\nwo mow own w nwo mo wmo wmF Eux "

Last year IC students stole dustbin lids\nfrom Putney residents' front gardens, dripping blood and\noffal on their way. In some cases dustbins were overturned and abuse was hurled at protesting residents. And\nGaynor couldn't care less. She is unwilling to ensure that\nthis vandalism by IC stud ert s does not happen again,\ndespite protests to College from residents and the local\nMP. As President of IC Union Gaynor is responsible for\nall activities of any event organised by Union clubs,\nsocieties and CCUs.

EftPSKflTE\nRecap: Smarty Saylor, ex-FALIX Editor and failed academic,\nwakes up on e day in the fabled Land\nof Cheapskate, which is ruled by the\nBaron and his minions, a collection\nof fairies, ogres and crones.\nAny resemblance to anything at\nall is purely unintentional.\n'Ah me,' thought Smarty Saylor as he lay in\nthe Cheapskate sick bay. Life had been looking up: he had gone from being a penniless,\nhomeless, out-of-work ex-PhD student and\nex-FALIX Editor to someone lucky enough to\nlive in 6 Queers Court Square with the cockroaches and silverfish under the patronage of\nthe influential if malodorous Eric Professor.\nHe even got to run the Baron's choir. But just\nat the peak of his return to fame, he had been\narrested for drinking too much ginger beer\nand spent over six weeks recovering from his\nhangover in the Baron's Dungeon. Slowly he\ngot up and pu' on his clothes. Today they\nwere letting him out.\nHe noticed that many things had changed\nas he walked towards the Baron's estate. It\nwas cold, and the leaves had turned brown\nand were falling. 'Never mind,' he thought,\n'Soon warm up with a nice mug of tea and a penguin at Bite Zoo'.\nHowever, when he arrived at Bite Arch, he\nwas horrified to see that Bite Zoo was not\nonly closed, but boarded up. He found a starving wretch huddled outside the\nbarricaded door under some large bits of\ncardboard.\n'What's all this!' he cried in his funny high\nvoice (he had still not recover d from his\nenc outer with Michael Arthur the good but\nnot very useful fairy).\n'Why is the Bite Zoo closed?' Smarty\nshrilled.\nBy\nJuvenal\nThe wretch shivered under his cardboard\nand his bright blue lips formed a word.\n'Would,' he hissed, crossing himself feebly.\n'Professor Would!...had it closed!'\nThe wretch shuddered and nodded a little\nbefore sinking into a malnutrition-induced\ncoma. Smarty noticed that one of his ears\nhad fallen off.\nMeanwhile, in a distant ivory tower Baron\nWeed slept, snoring irregularly.\nHe was old and tired. When he was awake,\nhis eyes were glazed, his glasses double-glazed. His position of Baron of Cheapskate\nwas unshakeable. His one embarrassment in\nlife was his good wife, Lady Marigold. The\nkindest thing to do with her was to ignore her,\nhowever her eccentric behaviour often led to\nraised eyebrows and behind-the-back s nig gers, although it was agreed that she gave\nevents she attended a cera in je ne sais quoi.\nWha a pity she couldn't inject some life into\nthe hidebound Baron.\nAt the Baron's right sat John Secretary,\nthinking about his carefully engineered fall\nfrom grace in Surefield. He had recently manipulated the Baron into removing him from\nhis space o us level 5 office and installing him\nin a dripping, rat-infested cellar. He smiled\nse ret ly, thinking how clever he was.\nSmarty thought of none of these things as\nhe crossed Bite Quad. He was transfixed\nwith the horror of what he was about to\ndo\u2014eat at Victual Munchey's infect or y. Munchey was well-known as a man of culture\n\u2014so much so that he was inclined to let it\ngrow on his crockery.\nSmarty's heart quailed as he stood before\nthe hunch-backed crone behind the counter.\nHe ordered his meal in faltering Catalonian,\nand after a few muttered curses and imp re cations, was handed a plate containing an old\nwet football sock, two used brill o pads and\nwhat looked like a spoonful of Swarfega and a bowl of viscous yellow fluid with an ominous\nblack fin protruding from it. He shrugged and\ntook it to the till. Suddenly he noticed some-thing.\n'There's no pasta in my sock,' he whined\nninny ish ly. 'DID I HEAR A COMPLAINT?!' boomed a terrifying ogre ish voice behind him\nWill the Ogreish Munchey have Smarty\nboiled down for stock?\nWill the rats complain to the Baron about\nhaving John Secretary in their cellar?\nHow many starving wretches will die of\nmalnutrition if Prof 'Bad Guy' Would has his\nway?\nFor the answer to these and many other\nquestions, don't miss the next thrilling\nepisode of 'The Baron of Cheapskate'.\nSHER\nBEHIND CLOSED DOORS\nPage 10 Friday, 18 November, 1983\n4. Victor Mooney, Refectory Manager\nWhen Victor joined Imperial College in 1952\nthere was waitress service in the UD H with a general refectory on the top floor of the\nUnion Building and the Butler had just left the\nUnion Lower Lounge. The Lower Lounge\nwas then quite resplendent with stuffed\nanimal heads adorning the walls. He now\ncaters for many more people in much larger\nrefectories lacking virtually all the style of the\nformer areas.\nVictor Mooney has the stature of a man\nwho has spent his life in the food and drink\ntrade, he has the ample girth that would be\nregarded, in people other than caterers, as\nfatness. He is instantly recognisable around\nCollege, which is a contrast to the College\nbureaucrats and stands out as a 'Man of\nCharacter' in Sherfield. He is the only person\nI know to have thrown a punch at Hector\nCameron-Clark after being let down by Estates, which he is frequently.\nHe is always willing to put on an apron and\nlend a hand serving food if the refectories are\nunderstaffed. Since he clearly has a great\ncommitment to Imperial College it is rather a pity that his day to day food is of such poor\nstandard.\nIn many respects he is like a captain of a ship flying a flag of convenience. Though he\nand the officers are likely to be capable and\nwell trained the crew are mostly foreign,\ncheap to employ, staying for short periods of\ntime, and mainly undependable. However\nwell the crew is led it will never accomplish\ngreat things.\nVictor's main fault lies in his old fashioned\napproach and ignorance of many modern\nmanagement techniques which are essential\nnow that university cash is limited.\nVictor does have Falstaffian faults and has\nbeen criticised for them, but when he retires\nand is replaced by a dapper chap wearing a striped shirt with white collar and cuffs and all\nthe character of a well peeled grape the\nCollege will be a much poorer place.\nThe Mole\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2014 1 1 IM \u2014 \u2014 \u2022 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews]\nIt may be obvious what 'Rag and Drag' involves and\nyou may have heard about Silly Sports, but what of\nSCAB Night? This is a somewhat obscure event whose\ntitle gives little help to anyone who tries to find out what\nit involves. Fortunately, with three quarters of a page at\nmy disposal, all uncertainties can be removed and you\nwill be able to decide whether SCAB Night, among the\nmaze of other Rag events, is worth attending.\nSCAB is the somewhat pretentiously titled 'Social, Cultural and\nAmusement Board' which joins\ntogether the performing societies\nin College. Dramatic Society,\nOpejatic Society, a range of music\nsocieties, Debating Society, Film\nSociety and Jazz Club all\ncontribute to make a night of\nvaried and amusing entertain-men tt, the profit of which goes to\nIC Rag funds. This year's offering\npromises much with all the\nSCAB clubs contributing.\nDramsoc are showing just\nhow coarse their acting really can\nbe by pe forming three of Michael\nGreen's 'Coarse Acting' plays:\n'Streuth', 'Alls Well That Ends As\nYou Like It' and 'II Fornicazione'.\n'Streuth' takes the piss out of the\nmany Agatha Christie thrillers\nthat have been drama tis ed, with\nthe only question remaining to be\nanswered being: was it the\nbutler? 'Alls Well That Ends As\nYou Like It' pokes fun at\nShakespeare, notably Shakespeare as performed by an all girls\npublic school. Assembling the\nnecessary female cast, from\nImperial College, must have\nproved difficult but, no doubt,\nthe lecherous talents of the\ndirection had much to do with it.\nThe final play is 'II Fornicazione'\nwhich pokes fun at the performance of amateur operatic societies with a taste for Gilbert &\nSullivan ie like IC Operatic\nSociety. Indeed, so complete is\nthe analogy that Dramsoc\ndirector Nick Moran is\nconsidering performing 'II\nI\" Cromwejjwn\nEntrance on:\n3 Cromwell Road, SW7.\nTel: 584 7258\n(Opposite Natural History Museum)\nCOCKTAIL BAR\nU Open\nMon Fri6.0011.00 Sat 8.00-11.00\nHappy Hour\n6.00-9.00\nCocktails \u00a31.50\nMonday Special\nCocktails \u00a31.50\nall night\nNIGHTCLUB\nI Open\nTues-Sat\n11.00-3am Party Night\nWesnesday\nDrinks 9 0 p Cocktails \u00a31.50\nall night\nSUMMER OFFER\nEntrance to Night Club half price on\npresentation of Imperial College cards\nI6H SCAB Treasurer Roger Middlebrook explains his accounts t the auditor.\nFornicazione' directly after\nOpsoc's SCAB Night offering,\nbut fears retribution from Opsoc\nchairman Jo Claydon.

All\nthe pieces are well known and\nwill be presented with all the\nspontaneity of under-rehearsal.\nBut seriously, if you want a good\nlaugh and fancy hearing what '\nthey sound like it will be well\nworth while and Jo Claydon will\nbe buying a few drinks in the bar\nafterwards\u2014for a change.\nFor the first time in living\nmemory the Choir are performing at SCAB Night due to the\ncondescending Martin S Taylor\nsuccessfully overcoming a generally apathetic attitude towards\nsupporting Rag, since they're\nFortunately, no tricks from\nMartin S Taylor.\nonly just getting out of the idea\nthat SCAB Night is a dirty film\neve ing.

The rifle\nrange superintendent took him\nonto the range and showed him\nhow to fire the gun. On leaving the\nrange to reload his rifle the\nsuperintendent heard a shot and\nreturned to the room. Mr\nChelsea College was shot dead at\nThursday at 7:30pm. Artemiou was found dead, shot\nthrough the head.\nPolice and forensic scientists\nwere immediately called in by the\nSports Centre officials. On arrival they sealed off the area and\nquestioned people as they left. A post-mortem was held on\nMonday and the matter is being\ntreated as suicide.

It is\ntraditional for the CCUs to fight\nfor the Morphy Oar once the race\nhas started. This usually de ge rates to a neanderthal punch-up\nwith fish guts, offal and dung\nbeing hurled.\nPutney residents felt that the\nevent went too far last year with\nmany having their dustbin lids\nstolen by IC students.\nA letter was sent to the Rector\nby the local MP David Mellor.\nThe Rector expressed his concern\nto the then IC Union President\nStephen Goulder who took action by making it Council policy\nthat IC Union will not have\nanything to do with the event.\nThe CCUs will stage the fight\nthis year further down the river in\nthe hope that the rising tide will\nwash the Vness away.

    "content": "Gaynor\nFooled\nAgain\nUnion President Miss Gaynor\nLewis and the Rector Lord\nFlowers may be the victims of a practical joke concerning the\nthreat of legal action by the\nrecently opened Sainsburys\nsupermarket.\nThe Rector's office received a phone call from someone claiming to be the supermarket manager threatening to take College\nto court unless IC students\nstopped removing shopping trolleys from the premises. The\nRector expressed his concern to\nMiss Lewis and asked her to take\naction.\nA worried Miss Lewis immediately started taking legal advice\nfrom the Police and the College\nlegal service.\nHowever, neither the supermarket manager or Sainsbury's head office have any knowledge\nof such action. The manager\nsuggested that perhaps the\nCollege had been the victim of a practical joke.\nExpansion\nDelayed\nPhase One of the expansion of\nUnion facilities to Southside is\nmaking slow progress. Work that\nshould have been started by the\nCollege Estates section over the\nsummer has only now begun.\nWork has begun on a weights\nroom and a central launder et te in\nthe basement, and the conversion\nof the old Southside refectory to a gym for martial arts and table\ntennis. Phase One is due for\ncompletion on 5 March 1984.\nIt is hoped that there will soon\nbe squash courts and a sauna\nbuilt into the old refectory.\nPhase Two of the plan, which\nMiss Lewis denies the Union has\naccepted, will be the move of the\nUnion Office to the Southside\nUpper Lounge.\nAerosoc\nDarts\nThe annual Aerosoc paper darts\ncompetition provided the usual\nvariety of unpowered flying\ncontraptions.\nThe longest flight was 50.35\nseconds achieved by Mark Rest\nusing a parachute and the greatest range by Benjamin Fielle\nwhose dart sailed the entire\nlength of the Quad.\nFELIX m nH MBH rai Two Ways to Get Plastered!\nThe RCS Beer Festival, held on Wednesday in the JCR proved to be a successful opener to Rag Week raising over \u00a3500 for charity. This is\nhardly surprising, since swilling large quantities of ale is one of the few\nthings most IC students can be bothered to do!\nThe Festival passed without any great incident, except for the arrival of\nthe Hit Squad who performed a large scale 'random hit' on anyone\nunfortunate enough to be in the way.\nThe organiser of the Beer Festival, Gareth Fish, said that he expected\nthe final profits to be in the region of \u00a3500.\nBot Zoo Tea:\nThe Saga Continues\nThe campaign to get the Botany\nZoology Tea Room open is being\nstepped up by Life Science\nstudents. Next Thursday a 'Tea\nIn' will be staged where cups of\ntea and coffee will Be served\nbetween 10:00 and 11:00am. Mr Peter Burt, spokesman for\nthe protesters, said to FELIX\nthat the demonstration was to\nshow Professor Wood the\nstrength of feeling for the re-o ping of the tea room. He hoped\nthat all those who enjoyed the tea\nroom in previous years would\nattend the demonstration. Mr\nBurt sees this as the last attempt\nto get the tea room open.\nICU Flouts ULU Ban\nOver \u00a37,000 of University of\nLondon money has been spent on\nthe presentation of honorary\ndegrees to dign i tories who have in\nsome way helped the University.\nThe only students invited to\nattend this lush event are sabbatical officers of each college and\nULU officials.\nGaynor Lewis, ICU President,\nsays it is a prestigious occ arion that will benefit IC (and herself-Ed) as all those attending will\nmeet influential people who have\na say in the finance of IC.\nGUC, the governing body of\nULU, have mandated their Exec\nnot to accept the invitations as it\nis their opinion that the ceremony\nis unnecessary.\nSpaccd-Out Sounds\nMr Desmond Briscoe, the former\nhead of the BBC's Radiophonic\nWorkshop lectured to a packed\nmeeting of the HG Wells Society\nlast Monday.\nHis talk spanned the history of\nthe Workshop, from the pioneering days of the late fifties, when\nall the equipment available was a tape recorder and a pair of\nscissors, to up to date work with\ncomputer synthesisers.\nHis talk was illustrated with\nmaterial from the Radiophonic\nArchive.

Predictably, the\naversion to re affiliating was the\ncost of membership and NUS's political extremism.\nThe news for NUS wasn't all\nbad however, a convincing majority sought further debate,\nalthough members of Coucil\nwere conspicuous by their ab-absence of this group. Unity with\nother colleges topped the reasons\nfor re affiliation, together with a need for a voice in material\nbargaining, highlighting the\nsense of isolation caused by\nd is a ff il ation.

It is estimated that between the late 1980s and mid 1990s the number of\nsuitably qualified school leave rs will fall by between 15% and 20%\ndue to demographic trends. The\nUGC is posing a series of\nquestions to universities about\nhow they propose to cope with\nthe drastic changes such a drop\nwill necessitate.\nAreas previously considered\nuntouchable are being brought\ninto question by the UGC, for\nexample the question of academic tenure and the length of\ndegree courses. Also covered in\nthe 29 questions are topics such\nas changing the balance between\ntechnological and arts subjects,\nfunding for research, increasing\nthe financial contribution from\nnon-public funds, and the relationship between universities and\npolytechnics.

    "content": "1\n1 I FESTIVAL The London Film Festival is one of the most prestigious film events in Europe and is\nan unrivalled opportunity to see many old and new films not likely to be on general\nrelease. Some ofthe best directors in the world will be showing their work this year; their idea of cinema is definitely not limited to that of the Hollywood blockbuster.\nOver 150films will be shown during the two and a half weeks ofthe Festivalfrom 17\nNovember to 4December. TheLFF is not perhaps quite as famous as Cannes, but for IC students it has one big advantage: the bulk of the films will be shown at the\nNational Film Theatre, just five tube stations from South Kensington. The NFTis on\nthe South Bank, beneath Waterloo Bridge.\nFELIX has not covered the LFF in recent years. Students have tended to complain\nthat the Festival is loo arty, too avant-garde and too dominated by foreign films.\nThat is untrue this year. There are some excellent films on offer. This article will try\nto provide a guide to the Festivalandsuggest a few of the films worth seeing. Most of\nthe films will not get press reviews, so I have split this article into two parts. Firstly,\nthose I have seen personally and secondly those seen and recommended by\nprofessional reviewers.\nI 've carefully selected films that Ifeel will attract most IC students, hence the\nlarge number of British and USfilms.By all means try other films out for yourselves; the best I can do is point out those that particularly interested me. There will usually\nbe just two showings of each film: times and dates are given. Further details about\nbooking can be found at the end of this article.\nFilms Reviewed by FELIX\nPride of place must go to the British films this\nyear. These show just how strongly our film\nindustry is reviving. Most are financed by\ntelevision, as is usual nowadays, despite\nGoldcrest, Virgin and Handmade Films.\nInterestingly, quite a few are wi tien by\nnovelists like Ian McEwan, William Boyd and\nEdna O 'Brien; they are just as good writing\nfilm scripts as they are conventional prose.\nGood and Bad at Games (Mon 21 Nov\n11:00am,6:15 pm) by William Boyd is both\nfunny and disturbing. Three men were at\nschool together a decade ago. Mount, the\nrugby team captain is now an officer and a gentleman, up holder of his class. Niles, the\nborn sportsman yet exploited by everyone,\ndesperately tries to ignore his present seedy\nlife and instead relive his old school days of\nglory and friendship. Cox, bullied by every-one, is now a journalist out for revenge.\nTheir old boys reunion is no fun and games.\nThis film is well acted and professionally put\ntogether, mixing Cox's attempt to win Niles\nover on to his side, with the story of his\nhumiliation by Mount ten years previously.\nYou will probably have difficulty getting\ninto The Country Girls which is today at\n6:15pm. Edna O 'Brien has skilfully adapted\nher own novel about a young girl growing up\nin an Irish village, then moving out into the\nbig wide world. Maeve Germaine as Kate\nputs in an enchanting performance as her\nlife gradually opens out and she realises the\nopportunities before her. The plot smacks a little of the well-worn path to self-discovery,\nbut the acting and the gentle pacing soothes\nthis film into something surprisingly enter-tai ning. No wild emotions here, but evocative. Meantime (Tues 22 Nov 11:00am,6:15 pm) written and directed by Mike Leigh\nis about the trials and tribulations of an\nPage 8|\nentire East End family on the dole.\nMeantime is neither oh-so-boring 'gritty\nrealism', nor is it Coronation Street\ncardboard cut-outs. Leigh is superb at\ncapturing the atmosphere of the working-class life. He doesn't try to preach, and as in\nall his work there's real humour to set off his\ncharacter's traumas. The plot proceeds via\n'incidents' and you can lose the thread\nsomewhat, but the acting is excellent: skin-heads, well-meaning aunts, the local pub.\nWorth seeing.\nThe Weather in the Streets (Wed 30\nNov 2:30pm and Thur 1 Dec 8:45pm) is\nanother stylish British film. The screenplay\nwritten by Julian Mitchell (of 'Another\n'The Weather in the Streets'\n'Liquid Sky'\nCountry' fame) is based on Rosamund\n\u2022Lehamann's novel about the hypocrisy and\ndouble standards of between-the-wars\nBritain. Olivia Curtis (Lisa Eichborn) chucks\nin her old life and decides to find herself in\ndecadent London. This leads to an affair\nwith Rollo Spencer (Michael York) who she\nhad a crush on at a party once before and\nnow decides to go the whole hog with him.\nUnfortunately Rollo is married, with a'pos i tion' in elegant society. Shot as beautifully as\nBrideshead Revisited, this film is perfect for\nthose who like to wallow in the atmosphere\nof the 20s and 30s. Finally, of all the British films I 've seen at\npress reviews over the last few weeks, the\nbest by far was the double bill An Englishman Abroad and Last Day of\nSummer (Mon 21 Nov 2:30pm,8:45 pm). The former is based on the true story of a meeting between Guy Burgess and the\n'actress Coral Browne in Moscow in 1958.\nAlan Bennett's script is witty and flows well\nand Alan Bates as Burgess and Coral\nBrowne herself use it perfectly. Burgess is\nstill the charmer he was before he defected,\nbut his whole situation is shown to be so sad,\ncooped up in a tenement block most of the\ntime, even though he chose it voluntarily. A man whose borrowed time ran out. What\ncould have been spoilt by political argument\nand the pressing for interpretations is made\ninstead into a film that entertains, pokes fun\nat and yet celebrates the British, and manages to comment on the important questions raised by the whole Burgess/Maclean\naffair.\nLast Day of Summer is superb. Ian\nMcEwan (writer of The Ploughman's Lunch)\nhas adapted his own short story marvellously from prose to film. The story is of the\nfriendship between Tom, a twelve-year-old\norphan and Jenny, a shy short fatty in her\n'An Englishman Abroad'\nearly twenties who comes to join the hippy\ncommune run by Tom's elder brother.\nBeautifully shot, this film is delicate, funny\nsad and ultimately profoundly moving. The\naudience at the press review was left very\nquiet and thoughtful. The acting of the two\nmain characters deserves special mention:\nAnnette Badland as Jenny and Graham\nMcGrath as Tom\u2014this young man put in a performance that in its naturalness and sensitivity was something extra special. If you\nsee nothing else at the Festival, I urge you to\ngo to this double-bill\u2014it was marvellous.\nThere are a huge number of American\nfilms at this year's LFF. These include two\nThames Silents (recommended later) and\nGeorge Cukor's complete version of A Star\nIs Born (Sun 27 Nov 9:45, Odeon Leicestr Square) starring Judy Garland\nand James Mason. Unfortunately Cukor\nkicked the bucket just before he was due to\nsee the final result of all his work. And there\nare five of the best Hitchcock's, all\nunavailable for many years:\nThe Trouble With Harry (Sun 20 Nov\n8:30pm, Queen Elizabeth Hall) is that\nhe's a corpse on a hillside. All the local\nvillagers have different motives for thinking\nthey killed him and should dispose of the\nbody. Unfortunately Harry died of natural\ncauses. It's a bit like Fawlty Towers, and\nthen again like an Ealing comedy, but with\nthe black disturbing humour that\nHitchcock loved. Shirley MacLaine makes\nher debut as an actress, the photography's marvellous and 'Harry' was one of Hitchcock's favourites.\nVertigo (Sat 19 Nov 8:30pm QEH) is in\ncrea singly seen as a masterpiece that even\nbeats 'Psycho'. The best I can do is quote the\nLFF reviewer: 'If there's a better movie in\nthis LFF I 'll jump off Waterloo Bridge.'\nRope (Sat 19 Nov 2:00pm QEH), The\nMan Who Knew Too Much (Sun 20 Nov\n6:00pm QEH) and Rear Window (Sat 19\nNov 6:00pm QEH) are all excellent murder\nstories, all celebrations of cinema,\nHitchcock and the murder genre. If you can\nget into any of these, you'll be lucky\u2014ring\nup, or try last minute at the NFT box office;\neven if they said earlier it was sold out, there\nare often a few tickets left, in case the Queen\ndrops by or something\nRecommended Films\nThese are films that have been recommended by many of the professional\nreviewers\u2014I have not seen them, but they\nwill probably be well worth a visit.\nOlmi's Cammina Cammina (Tues 22\nNov 2:00pm,8:45 pm) has been widely and\nfervently praised by countless people after\nit's first showing at Cannes. The film is in the\nepic style, an odyssey. A vast procession of\npilgrims sets off on a trek to the East, meeting all kinds of dangers on the way. The story\nis sometimes i rr ever ant, sometimes surreal,\nsometimes tragic. Children are often the\nwisest, and adults can be fools, but fundamentally Cammina Cammina is a celebration of the human character.\nGun ey' s The Wall( Fri25 No v11:00am,6:15p m) is about the revolt of a group of Turkish children in Ankara prison\nin 1976. Like 'YOL', this film is said to be\ntough and highly effective, using children\nwithout sentimentality to show the abuses\nand tyranny that ignorant men can inflict on\npeople, once given the authority. A short\nsharp shock against those who believe might\nis right.\nFirst Name Carmen (Fri 25 Nov\n11:15a m)m) is the Critics Choice of Derek\nMalcolm from the Guardian. A female filmmaker robs a bank to finance a project, has\nan affair with one of the security guards and\ngets her cruel but expected comeuppance.\nCarmen (Maruschka Detmens) is a real\nlook er. But as an actress, as Malcolm says\nhimself, she's 'asked to do very little except\nlook pretty and strip'. Sounds good.\nWagner (Sat 26 Nov 5:00pm QEH)\nstars Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Burton\nin an epic British film that in its shortened\nform lasts five hours. There's Laurence\nOlivier, John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson\n'The Trouble with Harry'\ntoo. The photography and music is said to\nbe fantastic. I doubt if there'll be many seats\nleft, due to priority booking, but it's worth a try.\nThe Wind (Fri 2 Dec 8:00pm, Sat 3\nDec 8:00pm Dominion) along with\nBroken Blossoms (Thur 1 Dec 8:00pm, Sat 3 Dec 4:30pm Dominion) will also be\nhard to get into. Both star Lillian Gish and\nwere made in 1928 and 1918 respectively.\nThe Wind is a murder story set in Texas and\nis a rarely-seen silent classic with wonderful\nphotography. Broken Blossms is of similar\nstature, making an early plea for racial\ntolerance, but subtly, calmly. Both will be\naccompanied by a full orchestra conducted\nby Carl Davis.\nLiquid Sky (Wed 30 Nov 11:00a m,6:15m) is weird, extraordinary, a modern\nfairy story set amongst the New Wave,\nstarring sexual perversions, drugs and\npunk. For those who like their films different\nand lively in the extreme.\nTrading Places (Sun 4 Dec 1:30pm,6:15 pm) has been a massive hit in the US,\nand is praised as perhaps the best comedy of\nthe year. A top executive and a criminal\nswap places, and all kinds of hilarious things\nstart to happen as Capitalism meets the\nGhetto.\nThe South (Fri 25 Nov 2:30pm) marks\nthe return of Victor Erice after a ten year\nabsence from films. He made a marvellous\nfilm called 'The Spirit of the Beehive' one of\nmy all-time favourites. The South is about\nthe developing relationship between a father\nand his young daughter who starts to suspect he is having an affair with a famous\nactress. Its themes are the adjustments\nmade by a child moving into the adult world,\nshe only half-understanding, confused,\nscared. Judging from Erice's past work this\nshould be good, if you can get Friday after-noon's off. There's just one showing.\nFinally, the bur b in the LFF guide is accompanied by a still from each film dis-cussed. In the whole booklet, only Erendira\n(Sat 3 Dec 1:30pm) has a photograph featuring naked breasts and taut nipples. This is\none film that is bound to sell out.\nBooking Arrangements\nMost of the films are at the National Film\nTheatre. A few are at the Dominion Theatre,\nOdeon Leicester Square and Queen Elizabeth Hall.\nMembers of the British Film Institute are\ngiven priority booking, and there is no telephone booking at the Dominion. Prices\nthere for Broken Blossoms and The Wind\nare \u00a34, \u00a36 and \u00a38.\nAll other booking is through the NFT and\nfrom the Box Office personally or by\ntelephone via 01-928 3232 daily between\n10:30 and 20:30 hours. Telephone bookings \u2022\nI must be claimed within 72 hours and tickets\ncost \u00a33. There doesn't appear to be any\nstudent discount. Last minute tickets, ie half\nan hour before the performance, will often\nbe available, especially for non-evening\nperformances. Telephone bookings made\non the day of the performance will be held3/4 hour before the film begins.\nTony Atkins\nFriday, 18 November, 1983 [Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Glengarry Glen Ross by David Mamct at\nthe Cottesloe Theatre (National\nTheatre)\nDespite the Scottish-sounding title\nGlengarry Glen Ross is firmly set in America,\nand more particularly in the jungle world of\nhard-selling, smooth-talking, law-bending\nAmerican salesmen. A sales contest is nearing its close, and each man is desperately\ntrying to better his position on the sales-graph, or 'board'. The top man wins a Cadillac, the least successful gets fired. No\nwonder the panic and frantic urgency of the\nmen, as they alternately form uneasy\nalliances, or cut each others' throats in order\nto sell more. What they are selling is tracts of\nland in obscure regions of Florida, to gullible\ncity-dwellers. And this they do, employing\nthe most marvellous kind of honied' sale speak'. This is brilliantly demonstrated in\nthe hilarious performances of Jack Shepherd\nand Derek Newark as two evenly-matched\ncrooks. In one brilliant scene, this nefarious\ncouple display every possible trick in order to\nprevent a dubious client from withdrawing\nfrom his contract.\nMore humour, in this un doubt ably funny\nplay, is given by the shifting relationships and\ninteractions between the salesmen them-selves. Unconsciously, they wheedle and\ncajole each other, using the same phrases as\nthey use with their clients or 'prospects'. But\nas the pressure increases, tempers rise and\nsoon the men are swearing liberally, gesticulating wildly as they exclaim 'Now you listen\nto me!'\nThe salesmen contrast markedly with\nJohn Williamson, the miserable office wet.\nOpenly despised by the salesmen, they are\ncompelled to defer to him, because it is he\nwho arranges the much coveted 'leads' or\nappointments. He is played by Karl Johnson,\nwho gives just the right shade of limp reticence as the miserable misfit.\nA wonderfully quick-fire comedy this, and\nstrongly recommended.\nAntigone by Sophocles (translated by CA Tryparis) at the Cottesloe Theatre,\nNational Theatre\nOver two thousand years old it may be, but\nSophocle's Antigone has some of the most\npowerful and effective drama going. A deceptively simple play, its main theme is the conflict between Antigone and Creon; between\nthe law of the individual conscience with the\ncentral power of the state.\nThis production has a1930s flavour, with\nthe chorus resembling grey-suited gangsters,\nAntigone in a turban and slinky dress, and\nthe guard a kind of British 'Tommy'. In no\nway does this detract from the play, but\nenlivens it and makes it more accessible.\nFELIX \u2014 B \u2014 WMI IHI III II Ill Michael Bryant is splendid as Creon\u2014\ninitially the stubborn and irascible autocrat,\nthen as tragedy unfolds before him, becoming merely a rather pathetic, isolated old\nman. Finally, he is so humbled and subjective\nthat he has to be led away from the stage.\nBarbara Flynn is a powerful and tomboyish\nAntigone, though sometimes she tended to\nproclaim her words rather than act her part.\nShe is ably matched by Belinda Lang, who\nportrays Antigone's more conformist sister.\nThe chorus\u2014an essential part of Greek\ntragedy\u2014have a fascinating collection of\ntimeless faces, whose fleeting expressions\nare intriguing to watch. The music of their\nmingling voices was supplemented by eerie\ntones from pipes, which intensified the\ndrama.\nSo, if you think Greek tragedy died with\nthe Greeks, going to see this production may\nwell convince you otherwise.\nClaire Moss\nWoza Albert, Criterion Theatre\nWhatever Woza Albert may be, it is no\nlonger funny. These two talented actors\n(Percy Mtwa and Mbongeni Ngema) appear\nto have lost their enthusiasm on the West\nEnd stage, where the actors now play mostly\nto tourists.\nThe play is described as 'our fantasy of the\nconsequences of a Second Coming to South\nAfrica of Morena, the Saviour'. It ends a little\nobliquely. Perhaps because is is based upon a series of improvisations, or perhaps because\nthe play's structure and form take a second\nplace to getting across the political message,\nwhich appeals far less to the British\naudiences than to those in Johannesburg and\nNew York. Because of this, the pair appear to\nhave lost interest in their play, and the spark\nof enthusiasm for it has long since died.\nSimply as an evening out however, I can\nrecommend the play. Full of African music\nand rhythm, the duo work themselves up into\na big sweat as they rush about the stage and\nthe gestures and the faces can speak louder\nthan the dialect, which is hard to understand\nat times. If you have not seen Woza Albert\nyet, then see it soon, because it will not be\nlong before it has gone.\nJohn Burgess\nm LIVE!\nNever\nMind\nThe\nBollocks\nA large contingent of\npunks descended on\nCollege last Friday to\nsee London Cowboys\nand also outnumber\nstudents at the gig.\nFELIX reports on the\nCowboys and support\nband Arista Blaze.\nLooking and listening Arista Blaze seem\nalmost identical to The Slide, one of the\nbands who supported Clint Eastwood\nand General Saint. They both have girls\non lead vocals, play with 'punk ish energy\nand vitality' and close their sets with\ncovers of Patti Smith's Because the\nNight. The only difference is the Bo Derek plaits and being based in Camden as opposed to Cardiff. This is obviously\nan advantage as The Slide have now\nbroken up. Unfortunately Arista Blaze\nsuffered a lack of crowd reaction (every\none just sat down and waited for the\nLondon Cowboys) which was a shame\nas they were much more original than\nthe top band.\nIt's possible we wouldn't have seen the\nLondon Cowboys had not Dram soc supplied and built a light show at short\nnotice when it transpired the band hadn't brought their own lights. We really\nneeded the lights or we would have\nthought they were some up and coming HM band doing their A C/DC impressions. However with the lights we were\nable to see a dandy bunch of dudes\nwhose lead singer was really doing Mick\nJagger impressions. The impressions\nwere quite good but that has little to do\nwith talent or originality. The music was\ncertainly powerful and dynamic but this\nloud and proud cock rock was as predictable as song titles like Blue Murder,\nCentrefold and Animal Pleasure would\nlead you to believe. A version of Something Else was poor whilst Reggae Bop\nwas best. Come back rock'n 'roll, come back CE& GS, come back support band\nwe don't need this aged rock thang.\nPeter Rodgers\n\u2022 B^H HH I^B HH Page 7\n\n"
