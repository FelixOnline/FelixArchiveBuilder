The two should-n't be judged with the same values,\nas the favour is clearly not reciprocated. So where were the letters lamenting the passing of students' meagre\nmaintain ance grants into history? It\nmight seem selfish to compare the\ntwo, but it is pec u lier that students\nare prepared to stand up for admittedly voice-less animals yet are not\nprepared to even comment on events\nthat they will feel the effects of far\nmore keenly.\nSHEDDING LIGHT ON THE\nGREY AREAS The letter entitled \"Us and Them?\"\non the opposite page raises a few\ninteresting points. The correspondent\nhas noticed the tendency of some\nCollege staff to huddle in a 'grey\narea' of departments' smoking poli-cie s. The department mentioned here\nis, I believe, Physics, one of the last\ndepartments to ban smoking in public areas (Felixes pas sim), and one\nwhich tried to accomodate both\nsmokers and non-smokers for many\nyears.\nThe intention behind bans such as\nthese was ob sent i ally for health and\nappearance sake s, both laudable rea-sons. However, it does require evenhanded implementation and, per-hap s, education, for staff and students alike. For students to see staff\nbreaking rules like these will not\nencourage them to keep to rules in\nother areas, such as the new policies\non roller b lading on campus. So\nmaybe a closer eye needs paying to\nthe greyer areas of departments and\ntheir policies to ensure that people do\nnot feel that there is one rule for\nsome and another rule for others.\nA BUNGED UP NOSE...\nLike many others, I have succumbed\nalready this term to a heavy dose of\nwhat is colloquially known as \"fresh-ers' 'flu\". I would like to thank\nwhichever fresher it was who\nswan ned through the office and left\nsome of their germs floating around\nfor me to breathe in.\nIt was, as sure many of you will\nreadily sym pathi se,a somewhat\nde abi lita ting experience and brought\nwith it its own share of sleepless\nnights, snuff ly noses and 'out-of-body' feelings. I mention this last\none in particular (though perhaps it is\nsomething pec u lier to me), as there is\nnothing quite like staring at a page of\ntext and suddenly feeling like you are\nfalling through it in a \"it's full of\nstars\" manner. If it wasn't for the fact\nthat the 'flu also engenders an inability to concentrate and an ecce s s it y to\nconstantly down 'Tunes', I might not\nmind the annual depletion of my han-kerchief reserves.\nBOLD AND CHEEKY\nPEOPLE NEEDED\nOne last thing.

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 25TH OCTOBER\nThe woman who wants to be .\na Defence Minister\nANDREW SMITH\nThe day that the Government's plans\nfor their latest Parliamentary session\nwere announced, the Minister of\nState at the Home Office responsible\nfor prisons and life sentences defended policies which will dramatically\nincrease the UK prison population.\nWhile admitting that the changes\nwould increase overcrowding in the\nshort term, Anne Widdecombe,\nMember of Parliament for\nMaidstone, spoke to Imperial\nCollege students on Wednesday\nabout Law and Order, and of her\nGovernment's plan to help build\ntwelve new prisons.\nIn a move, widely regarded as an\nattempt to embarrass the Parliamentary Labour Party, after seventeen years in power the Conservative\nParty have announced plans to interfere in the sentencing of a wide range\nof convicted criminals. Ms\ncontinued from front page\nLast week, as part of a questionnaire concerning security that was\nsent to all residents, asking what\nmeasures they would like to see\ntaken, students were asked to consider window bars, lights programmed\nto turn on and off at random, net cur-tain s, whether they would be willing\nto spend their spare time planting\nrose bushes, and whether or not they\nwould consider paying an extra \u00a32.50\na week for the extra security patrols.\nSo far, replies handed in have been\nmostly negative, and the feeling\nseems to be that people were not prepared to pay extra rent towards security. As one resident remarked, \"it\nshould come out of the rent we are\npaying already.\"\nCurrently, Clayponds Village is\ninsured by College. Residents' basic\ncover gives a pay out of \u00a32,200, and\nthe maximum pay out for any specific item is \u00a3600. The most that a student could claim for is \u00a35000. Last\nyear, Clayponds insurance claims\ncost the College somewhere in the\nregion of \u00a325,000. This could have a knock-on effect, forcing College to\nincrease insurance premiums.\nIn his interview, Mr Caldwell\nWiddecombe, admitted that the plans\nare a political tool, but denied that\nthis was the only reason for their\nintroduction.\n\"It is not just a crude attempt to put\nclear blue water between us and\nthem,\" she insisted after being questioned about her party's motives. The\nJunior Minister, who enjoys a comfortable 16,000 majority, insisted that\nthe package of measures was being\nintroduced for the public good,\ndespite the fact that \"there will be\nsome hiatus\", due to the inevitable\novercrowding.\nGovernment plans centre on the\nimposition of mandatory sentences,\nand thereby regularly removing the\njudiciary from the sentencing\nprocess. Anyone convicted of a third\nClass A drugs crime would receive a minimum of seven years, and two\nsuccessive rape convictions would\npointed out that Clayponds is often\nempty during the daytime and early\nevening. He also expressed a resigned attitude that if thieves really\nwanted to get in, they would find a way of doing so, whatever precautions were taken. \"The burglars seem\nlead to \"mandatory life sentence\".\nThis would mean that \"we will have\ncontrol over the point at which they\n(sexual offenders) get released.\"\nAccording to Ms Widdecombe the\noverall rise in UK crime during the\ncourse of the successive Tory administrations is part of \"a rising tide of\nlawlessness that has been experienced in every western country for\nthe past 40 years.\" She repeatedly\ndenied that there was any link\nbetween poverty and crime, and\nasserted that vehicle and property\ncrime increase with prosperity.\nWhile the Tories have introduced\ncrime bills almost every year since\ntheir election in 1979, the Home\nOffice Minister insisted that, \"It is\nnot possible for any Government to\nwave a magic wand.\" Her\nGovernment's new measures of\nmandatory sentences and \"honesty in\nto change tactics,\" he said, pointing\nout that they glass panels have been\nsmashed and window frames jem-mie d in order to gain entrance, which\nis, apparently, \"very unusual.\"\nDespite this, residents still feel that\nCollege aren't doing enough, mostly\nsentencing\" were an attempt to \"deal\nwith what we have.\"\nRecent personal attacks on the\nLabour leader, Tony Blair, also came\nunder fire during a question and\nanswer session, but Ms Widdecombe\ninsisted that the 'dangers' of Labour\nplans for trade union reform and the\nintroduction of a minimum wage and\nthe Social Chapter must be high-lighted. She dismissed her party's of\ntax increases following the last ele c tion, blaming the ERM and the re ces sion, saying \"We were derailed.\"\nLooking forward to the next\nGeneral Election, which she expects\nto be held on 1 May 1997, Ms\nWiddecombe would like to \"break\nthe mould\" and become the first ever\nwoman in the Ministry of Defence.\nPerhaps optimistically, she hopes to\nserve in a Government which will\nhave, \"a nice large majority.\"\non the grounds that it would be too\nexpensive to put bars on ground floor\nwindows and deadlocks on the doors.\nThey feel that that argument is a bit\nweak, considering the lavish expenditure on brand new carpets that have\nrecently been installed, at a cost of\n\u00a3163,170 including VAT. (Figures\nsupplied by Mr Daniels). The reason\nfor this, Mr Leeson said, was that \"on\nthe stairs, where the carpet was fray-ing, someone could have had a nasty\naccident. These new carpets should\nlast for a good 10-15 years.\" Mr\nCaldwell added that they had had a substantial discount for carpeting all\nof the hall at once.\nMr Caldwell pointed out that the\nmoney for the new carpets and for\nthe forthcoming new common room\n(estimated to cost about \u00a340,000)\ndoes not come out of the same fund\nas the security costs, though, ultimately, it all comes out of the rent.\nThe new common room, which students have been waiting several years\nfor, is in the planning stages.\nAlternative funding for this venture\nhas been sought, with the IC Trust\noffering to provide \u00a315,000 towards\nthe final cost. As yet, there appears to\nbe no alternative funding sought for\nthe residents' security.\n\n"

    "content": "12 LETTERS FELIX FRIDAY25TH OCTOBER\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nedited this week by David Roberts\nDeterrence and\nDetermination\nDear Felix,\nIt is with a wry smile and ironic\namusement that I read last weeks\narticles on Dangerous Cyclists and\nBike Coding having had my Dlocked bicycle stolen on the\nThursday preceding. I write not so\nmuch as to correct your quality publication but your misguided security\ninformant. It may be that the RSM\nwalkway is covered by four separate\nsecurity cameras. But to my unfortunate experience I have discovered\nthat the cameras are merely a device\ninstalled of psychological expedience\nfor the benefit of all (the student,\nsecurity and the establishment) concerned with the possible exception of\nthe criminals involved.\nThe truth of the matter is that\nwhilst the security reception may be\nthe epitome of modern CCTV technology the information relayed by\nthe cameras occupies only a fraction\nof the television screen. As for the\nattention paid to it in a security reception that on two occasions reminded\nme of lunch time at McDonald's Well, one wonders whether\nincreasingly scarce resources may be\nbetter directed toward some other\nmeans of crime prevention? Or\nwould it be less pretentious to say\ncrime deterrence? Without detracting\nfrom the cumulative advantages of a secure lock and bike coding, insurance it seems is the only answer, wisdom indeed for all to contemplate\nthan to learn of bitter, and oh yes I am, experience.\nYours as Ever,\nHumbaba\n(a pen name under which I'd rather\nhave the article published under than\nreceive hate mail, many thanks)\nDear Felix,\nWith respect to the \"News in Brief\nitem (\"Bike Coding\") that the \"safest\nplace for bikes is on the RSM walk-way\". Safest for whom? Easiest, and\ncheapest, for College Security cer-tain ly, but is this prompted as much\nby laziness as by concerns for the\nsecurity and safety of the general college population?\nWho thought that centralisation,\nparticularly in that area, was a good\nidea? It certainly won't have been a cyclist. Are the College authorities\ngoing to pay for the damage caused\nby leaving bikes out in all weathers?\nAre students in Chemistry,\nComputing or Physics really going to\nwant to traipse half way across the\ncampus?\nThe transport situation in London\nis appa ling. Car use is ridiculously\nhigh, public transport woefully\nunder-funded and under-used.\nCollege should be encouraging bike\nuse, not making it dramatically hard.\nQuite rightly the local police are\nclamping down on illegal pavement\ncycling, and not before time, but is it\nany wonder that a growing proportion of cyclists are turning to this\nmethod? London's roads are packed\nwith irate motorists casting envious\nglances at the urban cyclist who is fit-ter, happier and quicker than any dr i ver, pedestrian or bus-user. Road\nrage is not a headline or a buzz-phrase, it is a daily occurrence and a real menace to the safety of cyclists.\nThe quicker the police crack down on\nthat, with the appropriate backing by\nthe law courts who seem to value the\nlife of a cyclist very lightly, the better\nthe life of everyone.\nAttack the cause, not the symptom\n- the future transport of London\nmight not be the bike, but it certainly\nis not the car.\nChris Harrison.\nCaldwell: The saga\ncontinues\nDear Mr Feakes\nI am writing in response to Mr\nCaldwell's reply to Mr Baker's article two weeks ago, which stated that\nthe College is suffering from a lack\nof funding due to the Government\ncutbacks. I would like to point out\nsome key facts arising from the\nresponse which came on the same\nday that the new book shop tender\nwas announced in Felix 1065.\nThe ICU Bookstore currently is a source of income for Imperial\nCollege Union, as it is a Union retail\nfacility, similar to Da Vinci's and the\nUnion Bar. This income can, and is,\nused to fund improvements in student\nfacilities and activities. One obvious\nexample of this is the construction of\ndBs, now a venue of exceptional\nquality, funded solely through the\noperating surplus of the Union's retail outlets.\nThe question that should now be\nasked is thus; how can College justify the tendering of the ICU\nBookstore when an outside retailer\nwould not retain retail income on the\ncampus, for the benefit of the College\ncommunity at large? Surely this will\nlead to a reduction of the Union's income, which will result in less\nfunds for student activities and the\ncontinuing development of Union\nfacilities. How will this shortfall be\ncovered? I, for one, certainly do not\nwish to see any student services com-promised.\nThe tender is seen by myself and\nnumerous others as a particularly\nun savoury idea. The student body\nwould rather see its money being\nrecycled to the Union than go to an\nexternal company's profits and\nshareholders' dividend payments.\nYours,\nCaroline J. Deetjen.\nDear Editor,\nMay I make a small correction to\nyour news item (18 Oct. p.4) about\nthe tenders for the Bookshop?\nIt was never proposed that I should\nappoint a student to the panel which\nwill consider the tenders. What has\nhappened is that I conferred with the\nICU President about how best to represent the student interest, remembering that as one of the tenderer s( we\nassume) the Union could not properly have a member or officer on the\npanel. The President proposed, and I was delighted to agree, that Professor\nBob Schroter should be a member of\nthe panel. Your readers can reasonably assume that the other members\nwill remember that the new bookshop will exist primarily to meet the\nneeds of students.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Swanson\nUs and Them?\nSince I returned for my second year,\nI have noticed the storekeeper smoking in the store, and when I go to my\nlecture theatres 2 and 3,1 notice technicians smoking in the stairway, toilets and workshop.\nIs there a rule for us on no s mok ing, and one for them for smoking in\ntheir areas?\nH.O.D. policy is NO smoking - or\nis it no-one checking? Policy for us,\npolicy for them?\nSecond year student, standing outside smoking.\nGet a Life....\nDear Editor\nI would like to draw to your attention\nwhat final year students have to deal\nwith in looking for a job. IC may\npride itself on having a 'Careers\nOffice' to assist us in looking for a job, and College may enjoy looking\nat the Times League Table of col-leg e's graduate jobs, but it seems as\nif students do all the job searching\nthemselves.\nFirstly the Careers Office is just\nnot big enough to deal with the number of people who enter their third\nfloor office. They have one desk, one\nperson to deal with the enquiries of a few thousand final year students -does that make sense ?\nThen there is their programme of\nlectures and workshops. What happens if you are not able to go at the\nspecific times that they get people in\nto talk about filling in application\nforms and dealing with interviews ?\nThey have an impressive list of\nspeakers from top quality companies,\nbut if you study languages over lunch\ntime you cannot benefit.\nTheir workshops are even more\ndifficult to get into, at least you can\npack people into lecture theatres,\nwith courses being fully booked for\nweeks in advance. One session of\ncourses gets fully booked, and they\nwon't take bookings for the next lot -you can't win!\nIf college is serious about helping\nstudents in not only gaining qu ali fi cations, but also graduate jobs, then\nthey should provide decent facilities\nand lectures and courses that we can\nactually benefit from.\nBen Weir\nPhysics\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those\nof the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1067\nis Monday 28th October. Please\nbring some form of ident if ica tion. Letters may be e mailed to\nour address: felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Can\nyou believe, Mr\nCaldwell, that\nsomeone made\nthe crass comment that 'you\ndon't want to live\nin Alcatraz.' I know, it's dis-graceful. With\nsuch stringent\nsecurity, the last\nthing you would\nwant is for a set of\nkeys to get into\nthe wrong hands.\nOh dear. A set of\nmaster keys was\nstolen Not ay j ff tt fj f of i major problem, Iw^* \u00ab M W^W MW hear you cry, just a matter of changing the locks. Overheard snatches of\nconversation say that it took four\ndays to change the external locks and\nseven weeks to place the order for\nnew internal ones. Another story\ndrifting over the tables of Southside\nbar told of a resident whose lock\njammed, was removed after 24 hours\nand replaced after three days.\nStill, you say, there's always the\ninsurance. Oh dear. Because of the\nabsence of deadlocks, experienced\ncrime prevention officers who have\nhad a look at the place say that no\ninsurance company appears willing\nto take on business at Clayponds.\nBut, I hear you cry, there is the\nCollege policy. Oh dear. Maximum\nbasic cover is \u00a32,200. Not too bad,\nuntil you realise that as from this\nyear, apparently,\nthe maximum\ncover on any one\nitem is \u00a3600, not\nmuch use for a computer, which\nstudents have\nbeen known to\npossess. Additional cover\nfor expensive bits\nclocks in at a massive 12% pre-miu m. With this,\nallegedly, the\nabsolute maximum cover they\nwill let a student\nhave is \u00a35,000.\nStrangely, this is\nrumoured to be\nthe College's excess on the policy.\nTherefore, all claims are met by IC.\nClayponds has some very smart\ncookies and some of them were men-tion ing, while I queued up at\nDaVinci's, that the total pay out for\nlast year must be about \u00a3100,000.\nI'm not the man from the Pru, but\nthis strikes me as a less than entirely\nsuitable policy for insuring residents'\nproperty.\nAll these measures would be very\nexpensive, you say. Whatever policy\nthey have will carry an excess,\nthough a policy that would pay out\nonly if Ealing was sucked into the\nsun seems to have scope for\nimprovement. Cash is tight these\ndays. Bloody Government, you say.\nOh dear. Even though the building is\nonly five years old, it has recently\ncar, mobile phone,\nmortgage and a sweet\nlittle suburban pair of\nsmiling kids.\nThis is the problem.\nThe degree is no\nlonger a mark of\nlearning, of experience and knowledge,\n- in the course of duty -breaking the cycle\nmeans losing money,\nand losing money is\nfundamentally bad.\nOf course, I am not\nsaying that no students are there for the\nright reasons (to learn,\nto gain understanding\nimagination to complete it in the best\nway possible, thus gaining from it\nintellectually. The other was to complete it by rigorously obeying the lec-tur er's hints and tips, and following\nhis spoon-fed orders from start to fin-ish, thus learning nothing at all.\nWhich method should I choose? the\nsimple answer is that I should choose\nthe latter, because it is the one which\nWell, what a week it's been. Not\nonly has Des Lynam signed a new\nfour year contract (he was quoted as\nsaying \"The BBC isn't an employer\nto me. It's a cause.\" Pure genius), but\nmy dear old friend Ian Caldwell has\nfinally honoured me with a response\nto one of my pieces. The man says he\noften agrees with me, so he can't be\nall bad (some may think this deeply\ndisturbing, but there you go).\nContinuing this spirit of amicability,\nI have decided to be nice to Mr\nCaldwell this week, and give him a flavour of what's currently on parts\nof the Estates grapevine that he may\nnot have heard. I was initially going\nto say something just about\nMontpelier Hall, the sale of which\ncould net the College several million,\nand is easily justifiable for this reason alone, but then I started hearing\nabout rumblings at another post grad encampment, Clayponds. If the\nrumours are true, it would seem that\nthe inmates are restless.\nIt would appear that security is a major concern, not unreasonably, of\nthe residents. I hear that they average\none break-in every ten days, which\nmeans that, with 130 houses, the\nchances of getting done over a year-are a tad higher than the national\naverage. Allegedly, most burglaries\nare effected by jemmy ing ground\nfloor windows. The situation is not\nhelped by doors having glass panels\nand no deadlocks. College refuse,\napparently, to install deadlocks\nbecause of cost, yet will not let residents fit their own. Nor will they, I recently overheard, install bars on\nThere seems to be a problem at\nImperial. A problem so great, so\ningrained, so paradoxical that few (if\nany) have noticed its existence. The\nproblem is work, and what it is for.\nWeek after week, lecturers and\nteaching staff churn out assignments\nfor the students without stopping for\na moment to ask themselves what the\nassignments are for. Week after\nweek, students plough through these\nassignments with equally little regard\nfor why they are doing them; or\nrather, they have a reason but it is the\nwrong one. Why are you doing this?\nI might ask, and the reply is invariably 'because I need the marks',\nWhy do you need the marks?\n'Because I want to get my degree';\nand why do you want the degree?\nBecause you need it to find a decent\njob with a nice pay packet, company\nbut it is simply a meaningless qualification; but although it has no meaning it is nevertheless a necessary and\nrequired qualification. Therefore,\nyear after year millions of students\nand staff go through the charade of\npretending to learn, pretending to\nteach, simply so the machine can\ncarry on moving; and they are all\nreluctant to break the cycle because\nand experience); many of them are -but they do seem to be the minority,\nand the difficulty for them is that the\nsystem is geared towards the major i ty. This is a problem, because it can\nturn teaching into a farce. For\ninstance I recently had an assignment\nwhich I could have completed in two\nways. One was to take the assignment and use my intelligence and\nbeen entirely re-carpeted. Strolling\nalong the walkway one day, I heard\nsomeone mention that this cost\n\u00a3150,000. That's a lot of shag pile by\nmy reckoning. So let me get this\nstraight. No cash for locks and bars,\nloads a money for a x minster. And did\nI forget the new common room,\nallegedly to be costing \u00a345,000? The\nresidents have seemingly been\noffered a daily patrol if they are prepared to stump up an extra \u00a32.50\u00a33.00 per week. That wouldn't seem\ntoo bad if the previous had not been\ndone or planned. Wandering through\nthe library (they're all talking about\nthis, you know), I heard that Security\nhave asked if the residents would\nhelp in planting 'deterrent shrub-be ry.' So you can plant spiky bushes,\nbut not fit locks. It's not all bad, though. They are\nvery sensibly trying to cut the energy\nbill at Clayponds. Oh dear. Changed\nall the 100W bulbs for 60W low\nenergy ones. Result? People can't read in their rooms, so they have\nswitched on additional lamps. But in\nthe corridors, they save lots, you say.\nWould if they'd changed those\nbulbs, mate. They commissioned a survey, apparently, so that's OK.\nBoys and girls, being a chemist, I have a keen sense of smell for all\nsorts of nasty ni ffs. As Biology is a related discipline (that second cousin\nthat Mother says we don't talk to,\nmind), I have some skill in the scents\nof animals. Here I detect a furry\nrodent that has a penchant for the\nBlack Death.\nAny comment?\nwill gain me most marks. So I find\nmyself left in a tricky situation -either I gain the marks and the qualifications, or I gain the knowledge\nand experience. Which do I choose?\nWell, being a foolish idealist I would\nalways choose the latter, and suffer\nfor it - but how long will it be before\nit is literally impossible to complete a degree by using one's own initiative,\nrather than blindly following orders?\nDepressingly soon, I fear.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY25TH OCTOBER SPORT 15\nIC Rugby - It's not just the winning....\nA triumphant homecoming.., | .. .but the seconds do better...\nBARRY JOHN FELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT\nIC's first home game of the season\nsaw the team deliver a convincing\nvictory against LSE.\nDebutant centre Dave Gol opened\nthe scoring after some slick passing\nand interplay between backs and for-wards. Two tries by winger Marvin\nWoodhouse kept the scoreboard ticking over, although some slack\ndefence let LSE back into the game.\nAmaze y run by supermodel Andy\nMayes reasserted IC's dominance\nbefore the break.\nThe team seemed to go off the boil\nafter the interval, but the fire was\nre stoked by Rob Gare, who is start-...and the thirds\njust have fun.\nAfter failing to muster a team for last\nSaturdays fixture against St Mary's, IC thirds pieced together thirteen\nplayers for Wednesday's fixture.\nBarts were kind enough to loan us\none forward, which left us only one\nwinger short. Things started evenly,\nwith good defenses on both sides\nkeeping things level. With the wind\nbehind them, Barts managed to pin\nus down in our own twenty-two for a few minutes before their one man\ning to make a name as a try scoring\nprop forward. Yes, they do exist!\nIt really should have been a cricket score, but further scoring was\nrestricted to a second try for Dave,\nafter a scintillating scissors move,\ncoupled with searing speed, resulted\nin a try under the posts. Conversions\nwere something of a rarity, although\nat the end of the day the win was still\nconvincing enough.\nThe second XV upstaged the firsts in\nstyle, conceding only five points.\nThe awesome appearance of the IC\nside had the frightening effect of\nscaring the opposition into sickness,\neven before the kickoff.\nThe game started well, with our\nLomu-esque winger, Kolone Peung\ncrashing over within minutes for the\nfirst of his two tries. Further dominance resulted in a sparkling \"try of\nadvantage allowed them to open the\nscoring. They unfortunately then\nrapidly scored again, leaving IC 12\npoints down.\nShortly afterwards, the IC prop\nmade a good break, but was left con-cussed from the double team tackle.\nWith our numbers once again down\nto thirteen things stayed much the\nsame, with Barts breaking down\ndefence only twice more, leaving us\n26 down at half-time.\nThe second half saw IC take the\nupper hand, and with sound tactical\nkicking, frequent opportunities to\nsteal the ball, and formidable maul-the month\" from scrum-half Yomi\nBenson, and a try from half way by\ncentre and vice-captain Julian\n\"Logic\" Harrison. Superb kicking\nfrom fullback Jushin Lee (rewarded\nwith two conversions), and outstanding support from Miles \"Slim Boy\"\nGilder also helped us in this outstanding performance.\nHowever, the team slackened off\nin the second half, and conceded a soft try in the final minutes.\nUnfortunately, due to procedural\nwrangles this match may have to be\nreplayed. Next time they will all be\npuking beforehand.\ning, IC had a number of good attacking sequences - but just fell short of\nscoring several times. We sustained\nyet more injuries - another mild con-cus sion, and a sprained ankle to\nname but two - but we fought on.\nBarts managed to make their advantage in numbers show, and scored a few breakaway tries, to end the game\n52-0.\nIt was a truly magnificent performance from IC, under harsh c irc um stances, where only the lack of numbers (and perhaps fitness) showed. A good showing for our first match\ntogether!\nSport in brief\nHockey Seconds perform\nMission: Impossible\nThis was a prime example of a game\nof two halves. The game started with\na phase of good pressure, which led\nto Shaggy stroking in a cross from\nPD File. End to end play followed,\nwith Holloway gaining ascendancy.\nThis led to a series of short corners,\nfrom which Holloway scored three\ntimes. IC were forced to hold out\nuntil half-time.\nFilled with hellfire and brimstone,\nIC started the second half with a true\nsense of purpose. A delightfully\nstruck, defence splitting, pass from\nLeightweight found Shaggy\nunmarked, and he duly slotted in a second. A few minutes later saw\nShaggy alone at the top of the \"D\". Moments later he secured his first\nhat-trick with his annual well-struck\ngoal.\nMore intense pressure followed,\nleading to a long corner. Once taken,\nthe ball arrived at Rich Brunt, and he\nslammed the ball into the back of the\nnet.\nAt this point Holloway were\ndestroyed, as IC pressed forward,\nwith effervescent vigour. It was\nuns uprising therefore, when towards\nthe end of the half, Shaggy again\nfound the net with a reverse flick.\nPure disbelief flowed from the\nHolloway side, 3-1 up at half-time,\nthey were now 5-3 down. IC stormed\nthe second half, to win through\nagainst impossible odds.\nWOMENS FOOTBALL\nAfter a rather uncharacteristic start to\nthe season, IC Ladies, bedecked in\nwar paint, came good.\nLSE took the lead twenty minutes\nin, with a brilliant strike from 20yd s out. LSE scored twice more, before\nJo Staton pulled one back, notching\nup the Painted Laides' first goal of\nthe season.\nIn the second half, IC played\nbravely , but LSE made the most of a few lucky chances to take the game.\nEven so, IC showed a return to form,\nwhich should serve as a warning to\nother teams - the Painted Ladies will\nbe a force to be reckoned with.\nTENNIS\nThe mens team had tough opposition\nin their first match, with only Arnau\nand Alex securing another victory.\nThe womens team had more luck, as\ntheir opposition failed to turn up!\nBASKETBALL\nAfter a long summer of no play or\ntraining, most players left IC anticipating defeat. However, the match\nagainst Holloway ended in a3624 victory for IC. We shall triumph\nagain!\nSPORTS CROSSWORD\nThe winner of issue 1064's Sports\nCrossword was David Clark, the\nrunner-up was Matt Chong.\nPlease come and collect your\nprizes from the Felix office.\nFull solution next week.\nApologies to all those who sent in\nmatch reports that haven't been\nincluded.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 25TH OCTOBER\nThe case ofthe 'superfluous insurance'\nAre Imperial College students being conned into paying for insurance they don't need? Simon\nWistow dons trench coat and fedora and steps out to investigate ...\nAs anyone who has tried to join a sports club this year will have found\nout, the College appears to have instituted a supplementary insurance policy in the form of Activities Cards,\nbought at the bargain price of one and\na half pounds sterling.\nFor this pint-purchasing sum of\nmoney you become covered to hurl\nyourself out of perfectly serviceable\naeroplanes, climb walls and mountains \"because they're there\", scrum\ndown with 15 other sweaty, beer\nswilling , heavily muscled berserk ers( with apologies to 'Vicky' the\nViking) and ... play table tennis. Um,\nyes, that's right, somebody somewhere has decided that Ping-Pong\nfalls into the same category, insurance wise, as sky diving.\nOK, one could argue that an errant\nforehand smash could leave a nasty\nbruise but, how about aerobics? Fair\nenough, you might slip on a sweaty\nleotard but how can one possibly justify players of Bridge needing in sur ance. Do they expect the deck to\nexplode? That someone will tear\ntheir ligaments picking up an unusually heavy two of Clubs? Maybe a highly stressed player will crack\nunder the strain of a particularly tense\nrubber and will run\namok with a vis-cou sly sharpened\nscoring pencil.\nSomebody, some-According to Sports Manager: Frank\nMurray, Activities Cards are not\ncompulsory, they are \"recommend-ed\". Okay, this ain't exactly Lois and\nClark stuff (although I am better\nlooking than Dean Cain) but it does\nsuggest that somebody up the hierarchy is misinform-somebody somewhere ing the people\nhas decided that below. Whether it's Ping-Pong falls into deliberate I could\nthe same category,\nwhere, is either insurance wise, as sky\nvery paranoid or is diving\ntaking some\nextremely powerful narcotics.\nStill, back to the story. I must have\nbeen told \"I'm sorry, you have to join\nor you can't play.\" at least a dozen\ntimes at the Freshers' fair but a spot\nof investigative journalism has\nuncovered a large scale scam:\nYOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A CARD TO PLAY!\nYup, you are being mislead.\nResearch\nOpportunities\nProgramme\n\u2022 duller\nwii h tl\n\u2022 Hired\nfrom I \u2022 In lorn\n13.15\niR or. s clio in \u2022 Clnsin\ni Yukiy\n\u2022 Find oc starT available (free)\ne exchange applications:\n0 hours.\n/ww.hu.ic.ac.uk/uro p/ Help academic staff and help your career:\nJoin URO P now\nnot say.\nBut why do we\nneed extra insurance anyway?\nUnion membership provides insurance for students taking parts in club\nactivities and many sports clubs have\ntheir own policies to cover public lia-bil it y, especially those that are affiliated to their governing body. The\nRugby club for example is insured up\nto \u00a35 million through the RFU. The\nCollege has what was described by\nthe Finance Office as a \"massive\ninsurance policy\" which covers you\nfor anything that has a bona fide association with Imperial whether it is a chemical spill or a spontaneously\ncom busting pack of cards.\nThe interesting bit however is the\nfact that the Finance Office didn't know anything about this, ergo it\ndoesn't have anything to do with\nthem (really Sherlock?). So, the big\nquestion is: who came up with the\nwhole idea in the first place? Yet more detective work ensued\nand after a bit of lying, we a selling, pleading and bribing (OK, not strictly true but it makes it sound so much\nmore interesting) I managed to get\nmy grubby hands on the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies)\nCouncil report (15th October, 1996)\nwhich had this to say:\n\"Insurance: Members of all sporting clubs have now been asked to\nobtain an Activities Card. This provides the holder with BUSA Gold\nPlus cover during participation of\norganised Union activities.\nUnfortunately we are having to\ncharge \u00a31.50 to cover the cost of\ninsurance, printing and lamination\ncosts. We will more that (sic) likely\nbe able to get them sponsored for\nnext year.\"\nSo what is the Card for precisely?\nIt appears to do exactly the same as\nthe College policies. The Council\nreport informs us that \"I have already\nbegun to implement (this policy) due\nto the call for extra insurance cover,\nand the five claims I already need to\nput in.\" So it could be it is a knee\njerk reaction to cover somebody's ass. The author does concede that\nhe/she/it \"would like to express my\nconcerns in how effective it will be\nthis year.\"\nYet more digging around got me\nthrough to Sarah Corneille, the most\ninformative person I'd spoken to during the investigation, and somebody\nwho actually appeared to know what\nwas going on.\nThe policy was in it a ted by Tim\nTownend, her predecessor, who had\nin turn been asked by the College on\nbehalf of the clubs. Apparently there\na number of accidents last year and\nthe College insurance, which was\ndescribed as \"minimal\", didn't cover\nthem so, on the recommendation of\nBUSA (British Universities' Sports\nAssociations), the Union took out\nthis extra policy to cover personal\ninjuries and stuff like dental care.\nDoes this mean that before this\nyear we were dangerously under\ninsured or alternatively that we're\npaying for a policy we don't need (I know that it's only \u00a31.50 but that is\nthe equivalent of three sandwiches\nform the Sandwich Shop after four)?\nEither way nobody seems to know\nwhat is going on, which is the general impression I seem to have garnered during my time at Imperial.\nHence forth I suggest a 'teach the\nright hand to speak to the left hand'\ncampaign. Comments, suggestions,\ndonations, abuse and free tickets to\nprestigious parties should be sent to\nthe usual address.\nAnd so I trudge back to my office,\nhang up my mac, loosen my tie, put\nmy feet up on my desk and crack\nopen a bottle of bourbon satisfied in\nthe knowledge that it was another\ncase...\nnot quite solved.\n\n"

Just this term, inhabitants\nhave noted a significant number of\nbreak-ins, currently about one every\nten days. The estate, situated in\nSouth Ealing, currently houses 334\nundergraduate and postgraduate students in 130 separate houses.\nMr P Leeson, Clayponds Residential Superintendent, tells a different story. He assured Felix that there\nhad been no burglaries for \"about 4\nweeks,\" and that the culprits had\nbeen apprehended. One is serving a two-year prison sentence, the other is\non remand, yet to appear in court. He\nalso stated that break-ins had only\noccurred through ground-floor win-dow s. At the request of residents,\nCrime Prevention officers from\nEaling Police have already visited\nClayponds, and have recommended\nthe fitting of deadlocks on all bedroom doors and bars on all ground\nfloor windows. Students have mostly\nagreed with this, \"We wouldn't mind\nit looking like Alcatraz if we got to\nkeep all our stuff,\" remarked one.\nAll the window locks have now\nbeen replaced, though Mr Leeson\nclaims that students are not using\nthem. A meeting was held to discuss\nthe security issue on 13th October.\nAttended by Prof Swanson, the ProRector, Ian Caldwell, the Director of\nEstates, Graham Daniels, the\nResidence Area Manager, and about\na hundred students. This meeting discussed the possibility of dummy TV\ncameras, bars on ground floor win-dow s, and deadlocks. It was later\ndecided that deadlocks would be\npointless, as they would make it difficult to exit the room in case of a fire, and there not had been, as yet,\nany break-ins through doors.\nMr Daniels added that a lock was\nonly as strong as the door it was fitted to, and that deadlocks were not\ndesigned for internal doors. He\nadded that the cost of fitting deadlocks on all the bedroom doors\nwould be \"hundreds of thousands of\npounds.\" However, the College's own figures show that deadlocks cost\nunder \u00a3100 each, so a simple calculation shows the maximum total cost\nwould be \u00a333,400 for the 334 res i dents. Mr Caldwell dismissed the\npossibility of putting bars on win-dow s, \"We don't want the place to\nlook like Fort Knox. I once stayed in\na hotel room that had bars on the\nwindows...it was a grim experience.\" College have also conducted an\nindependent review into Clayponds\nsecurity. As well as replacing all the\nwindow locks, a new set of window\nframes were ordered 6 weeks ago at\na cost of \u00a317,000. These have now\nbeen delivered, and will be fitted on\nMonday. Also, Mr Leeson confirmed\nthat a \"man and his dog\" have been\nhired at a monthly cost of \u00a33,000\nfrom a local security firm to patrol\nthe campus at night, and \"deterrent\nshrubbery\" will be planted along the\nwall where Clayponds borders a council estate. This will consist of\n\"various sorts of bushes, roses, pyro-can thi a, anything with big spikes\non.\"\ncontinued on page two\nDon't forget to find\nsobering thoughts\nin Something for\nthe Weekend this\nweek!\nPHOTO: WEI LEE\nThe Imperial College Fencing team getting in some practice before\nWednesday's match against Barts.\nThe results of last week's friendly against the Royal Free and Queen\nMary can be found on page 14 along with the rest of this week's sport.\nLSE won't Top-Up\nANDREW SMITH\nThe London School of Economics,\none of the leaders in the rush towards\n'top-up fees', have abandoned plans\nto make their September '97 intake\npay for tuition. \"Administrative difficulties\" are quoted as the reason\nbehind the move, with students\nexpressing concerns that the '98\nintake will not be lucky.\nThe decision announced last week\ncomes as a working party, set up to\nexamine the mechanics behind the\nimplementation of fees, continues to\ndiscuss the proposals. It is understood that the Acting Director of\nLSE, Leslie Hannah, as well as other\nsenior officials are behind consistent\nattempts to introduce the fees.\nAn LSE spokeswoman confirmed\nthat the 'Court of Governors' would\nhave to approve any new measures,\nbut refused to supply details as to\nhow much the fees, if introduced,\nwould be. Other sources suggested\nthat figures of up to \u00a31,000 are under\ndiscussion. Unlike Imperial College,\nLSE are facing serious financial difficulties, despite income from their\nlarge number of overseas students.\nWhile LSE's Union believes that\ntuition should be free, and continue\ntheir attempts to persuade LSE\nauthorities of the same, they are currently working with LSE to provide a scholarship structure should 'top-up\nfees' be implemented. \"We feel that\ntop-up fees would mean that only a quota of people from lower economic backgrounds would be allowed\nin\", commented Sam Palmer, the\nEducational and Welfare Officer of\nLSE Student's Union.\nThe decision to postpone the introduction of fees comes amid statements from David Blunket, Labour's Education spokesman, that his party\nwould 'claw back', by reducing\ngrants to third level institutions, any\nmoney gained by tuition fees.\nSTOP PRESS: Researchers at St Mary's discover new link between BSE and CJD; EU officials rule out lifting of beef ban.

Firsts came right back up\nwith another boosting victory\nagainst last years high fliers. With\nthe notable absence of \"Fat Boy\"\n(again) and \"Archie\", the rest of us\nstormed on to kick LSE. all over\nthe park. With Psycho having a relatively \"bloodless studs\" game, it\nwas left to young Jamie to show\nthe rest what to do. Debutante\nChris Parsons seemed to think the\ngame ended early, hitting the bar\ntwice, when even Phil \"only\nscores drugs and birds\" could have\nbagged one. Thankfully, Tke did\nwhat he's paid for, putting us one\nup, before Arno \" shot up\" the\nLSE. defence, between 18 men,\nincluding most of our team, to\nscore the most outrageous goal in\nI.C. history! At half-time, happily\n2-0 up, we ate oranges. Little did\nwe know that they had been\ndrugged, allowing LSE. to score\nthe most off-side goal ever, despite\nan outstanding block by David\n\"honest, Roy is my cousin\" Keane.\nHowever, a little \"injection of\nspeed\" brought us out of it, allowing our 100% record to be main-tai ned. Keep doing the pills, lads!\nSeconds saved by own goal\nAfter a pre-match warm up at the\nComplex nightclub, Phil, Steve,\nLaurence and Donal took their\nplace in the seconds line up wide\neyed and eager for the game.\nCaptain Steve Fleming's five at the\nback formation looked solid with\nChris Parsons having an outstanding match. However, even with\nI.C. having the majority of posses-sion, the front pairing of Martin\nand Alex saw little of the ball, and\nRFH. proved to be dangerous on\nthe counter, taking the lead midway through the first half.\nThe second half saw two substitutions; Felix on for Hajo, and\nDave on for Phil, who had to leave\nthe field due to \"something he ate\"\nthe night before. I.C. stepped up a gear, and were rewarded with an\nequalise r via a Chris Parsons back\npass through the keepers legs from\n25yd s.I.C. maintained the pre s sure, especially through Laurence\non the right, who must have\nthought he was still clubbing as he\nkept trying to score. Victory came\nas Felix sent a deep free kick into\nthe box, where under pressure from\nAlex one of their fullbacks rose\nlike an idiot to head into his own\nnet.\nAsked after the game how the\nnew formation had worked, captain\nSteve was quoted as saying it was\n\"Sorted!\"\nFourths make it three in a row\nThe fourths again managed a win in their toughest test of the\nseason. Conceding their first goals\nof 1996, I.C. made tough work of\nthis BUSA game, against LSE.who were economical with their\nfootballing skills. Yet again man-of-the-match went to Darren - this\ntime with four goals. Nak and\nChris also scored quality goals.\nHowever, the team was let\ndown by poor defending, in particular by keeper Stuart. The worst\nmistake was a complete misjudgment when a shot from half-way\nbounced 10yd s out from goal, and\nover the floundering keepers head.\nThe ball being stolen from\nGeordie David in defence certainly made a change from his usual\nthieving exploits.\nNak and Mike made up, how ev er, with a superb display in mid-field.\nIC Volleyball\nescape jail\nEver thought what it was really like\nto be in prison? Well I.C. Volley did\nit, with some style! The men's team\nplayed in Wormwood Scrubs on\nSaturday in a league match. After an\nendless wait to get into prison (electronically locked doors, scanning of\nbags, escort asking permission to\ncross the field s),I.C. players put on\nan impressive display for a team\nwhich had never played together\nbefore, not even in training. True,\nthe mixture of inmates and staff\nfrom the well known nineteenth\ncentury prison were never a threat\nfor our team, hardly scoring more\nthan five points every set.\nThe final score was 15-5, 15-3,\n15-4: an emphatic win which will\nboost the confidence for the next\nthree matches in three weeks.\nGary Hoare\ntriumphs for I. C.X Country\nA beautiful day heralded the start of\nthe cross-country season, with solid\nperformances throughout the team.\nAfter a sedate start, where most of\nthe runners were left on the line\nchatting, I.C. picked up the pace,\nproducing excellent individual\nresults from Fishick, Ponytail and\nGaffer, coming 8the,12 the and\n17the respectively.\nWith the womens team coming\nsecond, these results provide a good foundation for kicking the\nbutts of the remaining U.L. U. colleges again.\nThe teams left Parliment Hill\nwith chants of Gary Hoare ringing\nin their ears, and Holloway whim-pe ring. Fencing : Mixed Fortunes\nThe IC men's fencing team began\nthe season with a friendly against the\nRoyal Free.

Embracing the AUT's cause, NUS president Douglas\nTrainer spoke of solidarity, \"Students\nare suffering in the crisis of higher\neducation cuts. It is vital that we\nunite with lecturers, teaching staff\nand other trades unions against the\ncrisis on campus.\"\nRepresentatives from ICU were\nsomewhat less vociferous in their\nsupport of the strike. Upon hearing\nthe news, President Eric Allsop\nadopted a carefully considered\napproach, \"We are in a very difficult\nposition, caught between a rock and a hard patch. The AUT have a perfectly valid protest, and so we'd like to\nback them on this issue. However, if\npressure is put on the College to provide extra funding, it will mean that\nthey will have to look for additional\nmoney from alternative sources,\nnamely top-up fees. This is something the Union wishes to avoid, so\nwe're faced with a dilemma.\"\nMary's Sabb funding in place\nKENT YIP\nAfter much campaigning by St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nStudent Union, funding for a sabbatical presidential post has finally been\nsecured. This should see the transformation of the current position into a full time role for at least five years.\nThe president will receive an\nannual salary of \u00a38,000. The funding\nis understood to be coming from St\nMary's current sub vent ion, and other\nsources and trusts associated with the\nmedical school.\nSpeaking to Felix, Piers Williams,\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices) of ICU, was unaware that\nfunding for the post had been found.\nHe did however recall that a motion\nrelating to this matter had been\npassed in an ICU Council meeting\nlast year. In principle, the Council\nhad voted in favour of this change,\nprovided that St Mary's Union were\nable to come up with the required\nfunding.\nSami Ansari, the current Mary's President, expressed his view that the\nnew sabbatical nature of the job\nwould allow future presidents \"to\nlead a normal life, to enjoy what the\nCollege has to offer, instead of having to miss out on all the social and\nsporting activities, as is presently the\ncase.\" He pointed out that, on top of\nhis clinical study, on average he\nspent over 6 hours a day in meetings.\nMr Ansari went on to explain that\n\"the nature of the job has changed\nfundamentally over the last five\nyears. Issues that past presidents did\nnot have to deal with directly, such as\nchanges in the curriculum, the constructions of the BMS building,\nfinance of the clubs, provision of\nrecreational space and sports ground,\nare all of a pressing nature at the\nmoment.\"\n\"That person must have the confidence of the student body and the\nself belief in doing a good job. Future\npresidents would be strongly advised\nto carry out the job saba tic ally. Given\nthat the new intake is going to be\naround 320, an enormous amount of\nwork will be required.\"\nThe Mary's President summarised\nthe dedication needed for the job by\nsaying, \"You take on this job\nbecause you care. You must believe\nin what you are doing, and that it is\nall worth it at the end of the day.\"\nGoldman Sachs International\nIf you've never thought of a career in Technology\nin an Investment Bank, come and learn more about it\nat our presentation.\nWednesday 6 November 1996\n6:30 pm\nThe Ante Room\nImperial College\nIf you are unable to attend, information is available from the\nCareers Office, our Web site http://www.gs.com/ or\ntelephone on 0171 774 SSS0.\nBANGKOK BEIJING* FRANKFURT HONG KONG LONDON MADRID* MEXICO CITY\nMILAN MONTREAL NEW YORK PARIS SAO PAOLO* SEOUL* SHANGHAI*\nSINGAPORE SYDNEY TAIPEI* TOKYO TORONTO VANCOUVER ZURICH\nGoldman\nSachs\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 25TH OCTOBER FEATURE 7\nDunblane : A balanced response?\nThe Government has taken this\naction in response to the shootings at\nDunblane. This incident was a national tragedy, something nobody\nwants to see repeated. However, it\nseems unreasonable to deprive thousands of responsible people of their\nchosen sport unless the proposed\nchanges significantly reduce the\nchances of such an event happening\nagain.\nOver one million people shoot in\nthe UK. They come from all walks\nof life. It is one of the few sports\nwhich allows men and\nwomen of all ages, able-bodied and disabled, to\ncompete on an entirely\nequal basis.\nShooters are aware that\nfirearms are potentially dan-gero us. For this reason the\nsport is heavily regulated by\nboth the present gun laws,\namongst the strictest in the\nworld, and by shooters\nthemselves in the form of\nthe regulations laid down by\nthe sport's governing bod-ies.\nThe phrase \"guns don't kill people, people kill pe o ple\" has become ac liche, and been dismissed as such\nby the press. It is true\nnonetheless. The most\neffective way to ensure\nsafety is not to restrict the\nguns in use by calibre or\nmagazine capacity, but to\ncontrol which people have\naccess to them. This task is\ncarried out by the police,\nwho control the issuing of\nlicenses, in cooperation\nwith the shooters them-selves. Gun clubs have strict\nrules governing who they will admit,\nand will not hesitate to ban anyone\nconsidered unfit. All applicants for\nfirearms certificates are required by\nlaw to have completed at least six\nmonths as probationary members of\nHome Office approved clubs, and so\nthese rules help the police in deciding whether to grant such a cert if i cate.\nAfter the tragedy of Dunblane, the\ngovernment ordered an independent\nenquiry into gun legislation led by\nthe eminent Scottish judge Lord\nCullen. He conducted a thorough\ninvestigation and made a number of\nconsidered proposals for tightening\nthe law in order to ensure that the\nFew people can be unaware that the Government has introduced a bill severely restricting the use of firearms in the sport of target shooting. Felix invited\nthe Imperial College Rifle and Pistol Club to react to the Bill.\nthe conclusions of the enquiry that\nthey had ordered. Instead they disregarded the report's recommendations\nand announced the bans listed above\nas well as additional restrictions on\nthe owning and keeping of firearms.\nlikes of Thomas Hamilton would be\ndenied access to firearms.\nOne would have thought that the\ngovernment might pay attention to\nPROPOSED CHANGES \u00a7 A ban on all handguns larger than the small bore calibre of\n0.22\"\n\u00a7 A ban on all self loading handguns\nThe bans were promptly described as\nDraconian by Lord Cullen.\nSome might argue that since the\nmajority of people in this country\nseemed to be in favour of the bans,\nthe government were right to capitulate to public pressure. I disagree.\nThe majority of the public, who have\nhad no direct personal experience of\nthe sport, have based their views on\nreports in the popular press, which\nhave mostly been biased and sometimes inaccurate. Most people have\nbeen led to believe that a ban will\ngreatly improve public safety,\nwhereas a firearms expert who gave\nevidence to the Cullen enquiry has\nstated that it will not. In fact, the current legislation should\nhave prevented Thomas\nHamilton from obtaining a firearms certificate as the\nofficer who interviewed\nhim recommended against\nthe issue of a license, but\nwas overruled by a senior\nofficer. This would seem\nto be a deficiency in the\nimplementation of the law\nby the local police, rather\nthan in the law itself.\nThe high profile of the\ntragedies at Hungerford\nand Dunblane has also\nmeant that the number of\nillegally held weapons has\nbeen forgotten. At a recent\nmeeting of senior Police\nofficers, the chairman\naccepted as accurate an\nestimate that 96% of\nfirearms used in crime had\nnever been registered. In\nother words, they had\nnever been legally owned\nby a dealer or private\nowner.\nWe should not forget\nwhat happened at\nDunblane, and it would be\na second tragedy if Lord\nCullen's recommendations for preventing its repetition were not acted\non. What shooters fear is that legislation will be passed which goes\nbeyond this and bans the ownership\nof handguns in order to punish all\nthose involved in the sport for\nThomas Hamilton's actions. We are\nin danger of losing this most challenging and enjoyable sport forever\nwithout the justification of improving public safety.\n\n"
