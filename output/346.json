FELIX November 13th,1973 NUS to fold ?\nThe net result of the\nStalinist dominated NUS exec's wheeling s and dealings 'is now courting\nout: Bath University and\nNewcastle Polytechnic have already discussed motions tod is affiliate from NUS and mur mw rings about d is affiliation are growing louder 'in\nmany colleges throughout the country.\nSo far none of these\nhave been passed, al though they have necessitated the despatch of,\nNUS president John Randall to colleges\nwhere the murmuring s have grown into an ominous rumble from the\nright wing to do BO.\nRandall turned up at\nKing's on Thursday\nwhere the first stages of\nd is affiliation moves are\noccurring to try and quash them. He did not appear unduly worried\nby the sudden emergence of these right wing tactics as those motions\nwhich had been tabled\nhad been kicked out.\nWhat does the NUS exec think about this? The story begins back in\nthe last stages of Digby\nJack's reign at the NUS National Conference in Exeter, Easter this year\n. . . . A motion was tabled by NUS exec to split off NUS services\n(travel, insurance, etc.)\nfrom NUS so that they\nwere financially 'inde-pendent. The reasons for\ndoing so were 'stated as\" the existing provision\nof NUS services and the arrangements for their\ncontrol are inadequate\".\nHowever it seemed strange at the time that\nthe exec had allocated\none of its two priorities\nfor the conference order\npaper to that apparently\nun contentious motion.\nIt is clear to all now\nthat in view of recent\nevents the NUS exec\nwas preparing even at\nthat stage to consciously liquidate NUS.\nAlthough it was argued by the exec that to\nsplit the services off\nfrom NUS would have\nsaved NUS from any financial 'maladies that\nthe services might have\ncollected, in fact quite\nthe reverse was true: the splitting ensured that\nwhatever happens to\nNUS as a political body,\nlucrative profitable NUS Services can continue\nmaking their money off\nstudents.\nThe demonstration\nthat occurred on Wednesday was spontaneously organised by the: London Students Organisation ( LSO), the London area organisation Of\nNUS. Earlier this year the\nexec had thrown out a motion 'calling for a national march, opting\nfor local demonstration's and expressions of support for the grants campaign to be organised on\nan un centralised local\nbasis.\nTo cap it all the NUS even presented to the\nemergency conference,\nheld at Imperial last\nterm, a motion calling\nfor a\" work in\" to be held this term.\nWhen questioned on\nthe nature of the \" work in\" they replied that it\nwas up to each individual college to organise\na\" do your own thing\" alternative syllabus to everyday college life.\nDespite this vacuity\nof leadership, students\nare prepared to fight,\neven though the demo on\nWednesday was not organised nationally by the\nNUS, over 1 0 , 0 0 0 students ( L6C estimated\n15,000) turned up, near-9\nly all from London, to\nvoice their anger at the\nrapidly vanishing value\nof the grant.\nTheN US are trying\nthe disgusting sell-out\ntactics of engineers'\nleader Hugh S can I on\nWho, despite a pile of\ntelegrams a mile high on His plush desk de man ding a national strike of\nthe AUE' W until the\n\u00a375,000 fine is Withdrawn, offers no leadership and left it up to\neach individual area organisation to arrange\nstrikes / stoppages / go\nslows/overtime bans or\nwhatever they like.\nThis comes as no surprise of course as the\nCommunist 'Party who control NUS exec have\nbeen continually exalting\nSoanlon (an ex CP mem ber) in the columns of their paper and covering\nup for each betrayal he\nhas 'done.\nNever before has the\nquestion of leadership\nbeen of such paramount\nimportance in the Trade\nUnions and theN US. There is not a squeak of\nobjection to the plummeting value of our grants visible In the\nactions of the NUS exec.\nThey are preparing quite\nconsciously to hold back\nany struggle of students\nthat turns into a political\nfight against the Tory\ngovernment. This situation of politically bankrupt leadership is a stamping ground for the\nright Wing who will use\nit to d is affiliate from the\nNUS.A s NUS collapses\nround the ears of the\nStalinist NUS exec they\nWill place the blame on\nthe students just as in Chile the rise to power of the Junta was the\nfault of the working and\nmiddle classes there.\nAre we to let them get\naway with this for one\nmoment longer? Only\nthe policy of immediate\ncash supplementary\ngrants tied 'to the student\ncost of living index can maintain our depreciating standard of living\nand yet they refuse to\nput forward such a demand to the Triennial\nReview or to rally support for it among the\nstudents.\nThe Y SSS will cai ripa ign most ruthlessly to\nexpose and replace these\ntreacherous leaders and appeals to all students\nWho are no longer prepared to sit back and watch the NUS destroyed by these enemies\nof the student movement\nto join them in a fight to\ndefend our grants and our democratic rights.\nParking Stickers\nI am still in possession of over 2 0 parking per-m its. It seems rather\nstrange that, considering the lack of official\nparking space, there are\nstill people wanting to\ncome to college by car and yet not use the college parking that they've\nbeen allocated. For the\nsake of others who were unsuccessful in their ap-pli cations, I think it\nonly fair that, if these\nstickers are not collect-ed, they Will be re-allocated.\nElectricity Supply\nYou may be aware\nfrom the national press\nand radio that interruptions to supply may take\nplace due to the power\nengineers' wages dis-put e. The London Electricity Board has in formed the college that,\nalthough power cuts are not expected, voltage reduction maybe Introd u ced at any time.\nThe normal operating\nvariation of \u00b1 5 % on the\nnormal voltage of 4 1 5\nvolts would, under such circumstances, not be\nmaintained. Reductions\nof up to \u2014 1 0 % ( 4 1 . 5\nvolts) can be expected\nwithout warning. Conservation of electricity during any voltage reductions will be essential.\nThe LEB have also\nwarned us that if the situation deteriorates a system of planned disconnections will be introduced. If you have ever found\nyourself in the middle of\none of our large laboratories late at night and a power failure occurs you\nmay well find yourself in a very ticklish situation.\nThis happened to\nsome unfortunate people\nwho found themselves 'in\ntheir department, in different parts of the build ing, at about 8 . 3 0 p.m. one night When the\npower cable running\nalongside the building\nsite failed. Without\ntorch or matches they\ngroped their way past experimental rigs and other\nsources of danger and eventually found themselves in a pitch dark\ncorridor. Trying to remember where the staircase was( there being\nnothing to give them the\nfaintest clue) provided\nquite a task and it was10 minutes or so until\nthey found it and eventually got out.\nIt is, of course, al ways better if there\nare two of you and the security guards know\nexactly where you are. Even if you have not\ntaken the precaution of\nhaving your own torch\navailable, security will eventually come round\nto get people out. You would think, of course\nthat the battery operating emergency lighting\nwould 'be provided, but no such luck, merciless\ntreasury has seen to that\nand the provision of such matters now is a very\ncostly business. No, the\nsolution is simple, never\nwork alone after normal\nhours. Always make\nsure that you sign in and\nout at the security post\nand if possible carry a torch or have one at a known place in your\ndesk or 'hanging up be hind the door or where-ever it is most convenient. Of course, if you happen to be in the lift at\nthe time, bad luck. The college maintenance en\ng in e ers have a routine\nemergency drill which requires them to check\nevery lift eventually.\nLady Flowers' Do\nThe first of Lady\nFlowers' get together s is\nbeing held at170 Queens Gate on Thurs\nday, 2 2 nd November\nBeer, soft drinks, snacks\nand music will be pro-vi ded. Unlike previous\nones, however, males\nare being invited. If you would like to go please\ncontact Jen, the Union Clerk and your name will\nbe added to the list. If\nyou are female, please\ncontact Mary Short.\nP.A.W. AGAPE\nDigby James, RCS Broadsheet editor, Jesus freak and Bible main-liner, is growing ever\nmore agape at the un-l paralleled 'political tour-j m oil of today's society. j Perhaps if he shut bis|\nmouth for a moment an\nthought about the consequences of his ramblings\nhe would realise the horrible implication's behind\n\" Spark\", the National\nFront Students As soci ation term'ly newspaper\nappearing on campuses.\nA glance at any history of the Hitler Youth\nMovement would warn of the danger's of a frivolous approach to \" f as cso c\".

He pointed out that in\nsuch a situation the\nquestion of leadership is\nparamount and that\nbuilding of a revolutionary leadership to fight to\n;\ntake the working class to\npower is the most urgent\ntask facing everyone in\nBritain today.\nA discussion on the\nreport took place with many delegates emphasising the need to rem ove the Tory government which was attacking their living standards\nurged on by the worsening economic crisis, and the betrayals of the present TU and Labour leadership in every situation\nconfronting the working class today.\nIn the evening a play\n\" Moscow Trials\" was performed by Socialist\nLabour League actors,\nmusicians and sympathisers to set the record\nstraight for events after\nthe successful Russian\nRevolution of 1 9 1 7 .\nThe trials which were\nthe most gigantic frame\nup in all history executed most of the Bolshevik\nleaders as agents of a \"Trotskyite - Zinovievite\nTerrorist Conspiracy\". Organised by Stalin\nthey enabled him to destroy all opposition to the\nformation of the Stalinist\nbureaucracy which usurped the political\npower of the working\nclass and established\nthemselves as a ruling\ncaste in Russian society.\nThe betrayals of the\nworldwide Communist Parties which necessarily occurred from the\npolitics of its Kremlin based leadership were\nalso stressed.\nA party building fund\nof \u00a3100,000 was announced as complete\nafter an excellent collection at the conference.\nAs well as the daily\n\" Workers Press\" the\nweekly youth newspaper\n\" Keep Left\" two new monthly papers have\nbeen added to reach out\ninto specific sections of\nthe working class to\nfight for the building of\na revolutionary leader-ship: \" The Entertainer\"\nand \" Miners News\" for\nthe entertainments industry and the miners.\nThe establishment of\nthis Revolutionary Party\nis a complete v indic ation of the correctness\nof Trotskyism and is only\nthe first of many \u2014\nthey will be built in all countries in the world to\nfight for the international dictatorship of the\nproletariat.\nAs Trotsky said:\" Iam sure of the victory\nof the Fourth International \u2014 go forward!\" Students and workers\neverywhere in all professions are urged to take\nup the challenge to fight\nto build this revolutionary leadership and join\nthe Workers Revolutionary Party.\nOVEMBER 14th1973 j A day which will pluck at the heartstrings\nof that small minority of relics from feudalism \u2014\nthe monarchists.\nIt is of course the day that Princess Anne will pledge her troth to Captain Mark Phil-lips. As has already been publicised widely in the gutter press and Felix has\nno qualms at repeating\nit; Princess Anne will have \" to promise to\nobey etc.\" Mark Phillips during the ceremony, but\nhe is only a Captain in\nhis regiment whereas\nshe is a Colonel in hers.\nWhat a precedent for ins ub ordination! Back to reality, however . . . November 14\nis also the day of the\nlittle publicised, still less understood, still less\nliked NUS work-in. NUS have decided not to change the date and the\nWindsor s certainly.won't so there will be a clash\nbut as John Randall ex-plains:\n\"If it makes any difference at all, we are\npleased rather than displeased that the much publicised Phillips\nWindsor wedding is taking place on the same\nday as students are demonstrating about grants. It enables us dramatically to draw attention to certain injustices\nin our society which it\nwould be appropriate to\nbring to the notice of as\nmany people as possible\non November 1 4 th\". He was referring to\nthe discrepancy between\nthe financial situation of\na female student before\nand after marriage and that of an average British Princess.\nIncome before marriage Income after\nmarriage Rent\nType of accommodation Married female student Absolute maximum of \u00a3 5 2 0 p.a.. generally less\nIncome almost halved, maximum \u00a3 3 2 0 p.a. \u00a3 8 . 5 0 p.w.( aver-age quoted by London Un iv.

House:9 rooms,2 bathrooms, i acre grounds GREEN RED\" REVOLUTION\"( II)\nOnce upon a time\nman had no other means\nof transportation than his\nown feet. He had to\nchoose the easiest way through his environment\nwhen he wanted to move\naround. Occasionally he\nwould have to remove\nstones, plants or trees to\nfacilitate his transportation or that of his goods.\nThis was decided by\nhim alone (or in small\nsocial groups) so that\nthe same people that\nwould work would benefit of the results.\nNowadays road build-ers, car makers, etc. (i.e. scientists and engineers) are not controlled\nby human decision, in\nfact, they are not controlled at all, but they\nare encouraged to grow\nindefinitely by the artificial profit system. What\nmakes things even\nworse is that travellers\nor commuters are also\nencouraged to move\nmore and faster by the\nartificial profit system,\neither directly (travel\nagents, British Rail ad verts, etc.) or indirectly\n(faster moving means\nmore business). In other\nwords the situation is\ncompletely out of control and there is no recognised way of telling\nwhether we have very\nlittle, enough or too\nmuch or too fast move-ment; worse than that,\nby definition, we have\ntoo little, and this is supposed to apply forever!\nand even worse, we don't object to it! But\nhow are we at l.C. involved in this systematic\nblind pursuit?\nLet's look at one of\nthe products of the kind\nof science and technology we are normally\npursuing at l.C. If \" Concorde\" ever\ncomes into service, it\nwill bring to a few a faster rhythm of life, and because of the nature of\nour present social s ys tem, it will bring them\nprivilege. This also means a disadvantage\nfor those who don't use\nit, who will eventually\ncome to demand its use,\nknowing that this way of\nreducing the privilege\ngap is more feasible\nthan the other alternative, i.e. trying to stop\nConcorde once it's brought into use. In\nother words, social ad diction to the new crea-ture. This means that the\n\" advantages\"( if there\nare any) of this plane\nwould really come to the\npeople when its use was widely spread ( which would be a long way ahead) time by which another similar invention\nwould appear, discriminating the majority and repeating the cycle. That\nis, in the meantime (i.e. always) the majority of\npeople would suffer from\ndiscrimination and an unsatisfied need. This\nhappens because the\nplane is designed to create a necessity for all, and its creation was motivated by profits and by the same uncontrolled - growth - maniac -mad race dead circle.\nThis plane is no revolutionary thing, but the\nlogical by-product of\ncontinuing our old trends of building whatever can be built as long\nas we can create a demand for it, and in the\nabsence of a humane\nsystem controlling both\nthe \" supply and demand of transportation\" which by the way is now regarded as purely economic commodity( fam-i liar?). This fits very well into the definition of the\nGreen-Red \" Revolution\" that I gave in the last\nissue of \" Felix\", namely\nthe systematic substitution of man's abilities,\nsenses and mechanisms by institutions, organisations, machines or ap-para tus, that lead to the\ngradual atrophy of the\nformer s and addiction to\nor dependence on the\nlatter s, with the consequent control or manipulation of human masses\nand finally leading to\nsome kind of enslave-ment.\nThe worst part of the\nstory is that we at l.C.( supposed to be going\nto build the world of to-morrow, etc. . . . ) are\ncompelled to co-operate.\nThis is done by prepackaged curricula, pre-defined professions,\nmonopoly of degrees\nand qualifications,\nmonopoly of information\nand learning tools in universities and colleges,\nmonopoly of privileges\nfor those who consume\nmore institutionalized\n\" education\", fragmenting and specialising (i.e. lengthening) fields of\nstudy, thus restricting\nour view of the world, labelling taboo the mixing of science or technology with politics, eco-logy, sociology, etc., etc.\nBut even worse is that\nnobody can be held responsible for all this,\nmoreover I can't imagine anybody (or a group)\nso clever and destructive to have implemented\nsuch a system, and yet\npass unnoticed. Thus, it\nseems, that the only\n\" guilty\" persons that we can find are ourselves\nfor not stopping such situation; but are we too\nimpotent already? . . . .\nJ. AGUIRRE Ci v.Eng. DISAFFILIATION MOVES\nby BATH UNIVERSITY\nSTUDENTS UNION\nIn a non-policy making\ndebate at Bath University last week a motion\nto d is affiliate from NUS was proposed by President John Kiddey.\nKid dey said that NUS conferences were too\npre-occupied with Chile\nand Northern Ireland,\n\" issues not relevant to\nstudents\". He said that\nnot enough discussion was spent on education\nand student welfare.\nNUS President John Randall spoke against\nthe motion saying that\nthe correct thing for Bath\nto do was to stay within\nNUS and fight to get\nmotions of interest to it\nprior it is ed at NUS con-ference s. He failed to point out\nthe necessity for discussion on issues other than\neducation and student\nwelfare for the political\nlessons that can be\nlearnt from these events.\nHe also failed to mention that, isolated from\nthe strength of the NUS students and their unions\nwould be open to the most enormous dangers.\nDisaffiliation would ef rf ect iv ely sabotage the\nstudent union at Bath or\nanywhere else.\n\n"

It\nis hard to see exactly\nWhats its purpose is. It\ncan hardly be designed\nto bolster the author's ego since he somehow neglected to sign his real\nname at the bottom, and\nviewed as humour it is\nover worked, pretentious\nand downright tired.\nWhich ever way you look\nat it, it doesn't say much for the mentality lurking\naround somewhere at its\npoint of origin.\nHowever, on reflection I realised that it\neffectively illustrates a rather distressing trend\nin society as a whole.\nThis is the widespread\nattitude that the homosexual is automatically\nfunny. Now I'm sure we\nall know., and love (if\nyou'll pardon the expr es sion) Kenneth Williams and his particular brand\nof humour, (I 'll do my best to ignore Dick Emery and his particular\nbrand of humour), but\nhe does perpetuate the\nidea of the camp \"ster-eo type\" that exists only\nas a small minority of\nthe gay scene, and he is,\ninto a.... stool, slowly\n(at first) to rest my poor\nfootsies, when I thought,\n\" Ooo h!

Too much talk\nand not enough music, was, I think, the general opinion and what was played, included none of his best material.\nAt least three quarters of his performance was backed by Crazy Horse( now renamed the Santa Monica Fliers) and he only\nplayed acoustic guitar\nand harp after leaving\nthe stage and returning\nfor an encore. This strange act of petulance or sarcasm came after\nonly 4 0 minutes in which he had commented on the silence of the audie n ce( what did he ex-pec t?) and had given up one of his lengthy, involved introductions due\nto shout of ' Rock and Roll', ' Southern Man' and' Ohio' from the audience. The only really\npositively memorable number was' Please take my advice' which was backed by acc or dion and harmonies from Nils Lofgren Some other numbers played were To night's the night' which opened the set and was inexplicably played again later on,' Albuquerque' and Cowgirl in the S and \u2014 (the final number) \u2014\nwhich contained a long\nand chaotic double lead\nguitar jam from Young and Lofgren.\nAt times ha was arrogant and cyn. cal and it\nwas difficult to i ell when he was being serious.\nHe established no rapport with the audience who remained hopeful\nand frustrated, indeed several people even\nwalked out in disgust\nand protest. I realise\nthat he must be bored with playing material\nfrom 'After the Gold rush' and 'Harvest'\nwhich are in his past,\nbut I think that there is\na lack of new songs in his present. Do the two albums of live material,\nold tapes plus a few\nnew songs indicate\nstagnation?\nVery sad. Palant iri on. BOOKS\nIN A FREE STATE V.S. Naipaui\nPenguin 35p In a Free State it is\naxiomatic that men should be able to\nchange their roles, but\nrarely is it openly rec ogni sed that the exploiter will probably become the exploited.\nExploitation and the part of the underdog serve to connect the five\ntightly-drawn pieces in\nthis welcome addition to the Penguin library.\nThe story was awarded the Booker Prize in\n1971, and deservedly\nso, for V.S. Naipaul' s writing is, as always,\neconomical, and his character is ation fault-less. Without effort, we consider a proud tramp\non a steamer trip, feel\nthe problems of an Indian immigrant in Western Society, and drive\nthrough Africa with two\nEnglish ex patriots. Though projected\nthrough these characters, our picture is not\naffected or distorted;\npeople act as we would expect them to, and although their behaviour( continued page5) X COUNTRY Following our extremely narrow defeat\nat the hands of the Met.\nPolice(6 to count, the\npolice having the first 7\nfinishers) the. CrossCountry Club set off to\nthe middle of Kent for\na change of air and a race against Wye College Not Only was there\na change of air but also a dramatic change of\nresult, for both our teams beat Wye' s single team though only\nbecause they were less\nfit than we. For the first\ntime ever we put on a team finish with our first\nfour runners Rob, ian, Paul and Alf, so far\nahead that they waited\nfor each other and fin-is he d together, and behind the next Wye runner were Steve and Keith with no chance of\nbeing caught or catch ing up so i they to or an in together. Another new departure was Paul's short cut through\na thorn bush and he finished with an impressive amount of blood flowing from his wounds. Speaking of de-part ure s,our journey to\nWye was not without in-c ident. Having to\nchange trains at Ash ford we had been in formed that there would be three minutes between trains. Ian Ellis\n(not Iris) optimistic\nat the punctuality of BR thought to answer a call\nof nature and emerged to see the train gathering speed. Fortunately,\nthe train stopped, though whether this was in response to lan's cry of \" comeback\" or bec a use a door of the\ntrain had been flung\nopen by Keith anticipating his leaping aboard( though Ian was running in the opposite direction to the train) is\nnot yet established.( It\nis rumoured that Ian\nhas been reading a book: \" 1 0 1 ways to\nStar\", and this may . . .)\nThe course was up and down several of the\nsteeper hills near Wye College and for such a terrain it was surprising there were nobodies strewn about the route\nafter the race, but even\nDave Jones and Pete\nJohnson finished, beating the last two of the\nfive Wye runners. For some reason the results\nwere worked out including 6 of our runners in\na team and only 5 of\ntheirs: this was swiftly\ncorrected. After the race and some hotly (if not well)\ncontested games of bar billiards we took part in\na torch \u2014 ( real flame) \u2014\nlight procession up an other long and steep hill\nto a large bonfire party\nwhere there were fire-works, some of which went whe eu' all by themselves. Then there\nwas a hurried return to\nthe bar, only to find it\nopen, where festivities\ncontinued well into the night, or at least until\n10.30 p.m. when we had to stagger back to the\nstation to catch the last\ntrain home.

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNovember 13th,1973 FREE! ISSUE No.3461U GM Thursday 12,45 p.m. in the Great Hall\nMASSIVE RESPONSE TO GRANTS DEMO OVER10,000 ON MARCH Over 10,000 students, mainly from London but some from further afield, turned\nup for the grants demonstration organised\nby the London Students Organisation last\nWednesday.\nA rally was held at\ni he Friends, MeetingHouse, Euston Square and speakers included representatives of\nTrade Unions, teachers\nand old age pensioners. The march started at\nMalet Street at 3 p.m. and moved off chanting slogans down across the Waterloo Bridge to\nthe Department of Edu cation and Science headquarters on the\nSouth bank.\nRinged on all sides by peacefully plodding policemen, the march was uneventful and well-ordered.\nParticularly vociferous was the contingent\nfrom the National Union of School Students( NUSS) who were welle quipped with loud-hail ers and led the chanting of slogans in\nmany parts of the demo.\nAt times the lilting\nsopranos of Phillipa Fawcett College when not shouting raucous demands, broke out in\nsong protesting at the level of the grants.\nThe IC contingent\nwas small and consisted mainly of \" the regulars\". Most of the\nnumbers for the march came not from the Colleges of the University\nof London, but from the Polytechnics, Teacher Training Colleges and Colleges of Further\nEducation, in and around London. A somewhat be-mused, if sympathetic response was received\nfrom members of the\npublic who thronged the pavements to watch and were promptly\nhanded explanatory\nbump h by enthusiastic\ngirl students.\nA policeman had to\nbe specially detailed to\nguarda Rolls Royce( parked on a yellow\nline, mid - afternoon!)\nwhich was inundated with leaflets from the demonstration. King's College in the\nStrand was greeted with a chorus of boos and hisses due to the\nlarge number of scab students who were watching out of the windows but who refused to participate in\nthe march. Two delegates from\neach College attended\na meeting on the grants\ncampaign held during the afternoon. It is not\nknown whether representatives from IC were there.\nThe next step in the fight for the four basic NUS demands will be a\" work in\", organised on a collegiate basis, to\ntake place on No vem ber 14th. NUS Secretary acquitted\nSteve Parry, Secretary of the NUS, was arrested, along with\nseveral others including Tariq A li,on a demonstration in July against\nCaetano the Portuguese Premier.\nHe was charged with\nassault but acquitted\ndue to inconsistencies in the police evidence on Thursday1 st November.\nTariq Ali however was fined \u00a350 despite photographic evidence\" disproving\" the police case that Ali managed to assault two con stables while holding a briefcase in his hand. New Chair\nfor\nBiochem\nA second chair has been instituted in the\nDepartment of Biochemistry here at IC to\nbe known as the Rank Chair of Physiological Biochemistry. The Chair will be financed by the J. Arthur Rank Group Charity.\nIt is not known at\npresent who will take\nup the Chair. UC Give in\nThe boards inscribed with the names of past\nPresidents, Deputy Presidents and Honorary Secretaries of Imperial College Union have been returned.\nThey were wrenched off the walls of the S CR in the Union building a few weeks ago by persons not unlike certain of the rabble that\nclaim to inhabit University College Engineering Department.\nEnquiries led by\nDeputy President Dave\nSinclair soon revealed\nthat the above as sump tion was not a million\nmiles from the truth.\nA telephone call was duly made by Dave Sinclair, in which the possibility of legal action to\nretrieve the boards was not left unsaid, to the\nabove-mentioned hoard of butter-fingered mean-der thal s who know not\nthe meaning of in vio late.\nThe boards were instantly returned last\nWednesday and after\nsterilisation will be soon on show again in all their gilded spend our. PURPLE PITCH\nThis week I have decided to write\na totally un political Patch, as I think\nthat there is a great deal within the Union which we must begin to sort\nout. The main item at the moment is\nthe behaviour of a great number of\nour students at parties and the like.\nI have always given students the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their behaviour and attitude to\ntheir neighbours, and also those\nwho are working for the benefit of\nthe students, but unfortunately,\nonce one has seen the aftermath of\n\" Student fun\" then one begins to\nwonder how thoughtful students\nreally are.\nAfter a while one expects to see broken glasses, broken bottles,\nsome litter and occasionally a little\ndamage, but this term we have been getting into the state of walking up the staircases amid the stench of\npints of vomit, urine, and when one enters the toilets finding that some considerate student has deposited human excreta upon both the floor\nand also the walls. I can, if I try very\nhard see that once a person is\npissed and is desperately trying to\nimpress his friends, that this type of\ndisplay could be very funny ( Ha. Ha.) but I think that if this same person were to find himself with the\nunenviable task the following morning of having to clear up the mess which he has made, then the situation would be somewhat different.\nWe have got to the state at the moment where the cleaners are about to refuse to clean any of the\n\" Student areas\" at all unless something is done about the obnoxious conditions in which the rooms are left. Iam not exaggerating when I say that some of the cleaners have\nbeen known to make themselves ill\nby trying to clean the shit and vomit\noff the floors after student parties\nthe previous night. You may say that\nthe way of preventing this kind of\ntrouble re-occurring is to get hold of the childish prat who is causing the mess and make him clear it up once he is sober, but unfortunately,\nunless one could do a vast amount of\nanalysis throughout the college,\nthen it would be very difficult to\ntrace the owner of the aforesaid ex-cr eta. Iam afraid that if this is becoming the ' normal' way for a student to be-have, then I would like to recommend to our Academic Affairs\nOfficer that he approach the Board of studies with a view to inserting in\nevery student's syllabus a course in\n' Common decency, and how to act like an adult'.\nThe problem is not merely one of\nfilth and squalor. There is also the\nproblem of noise at parties, and especially excessive noise after\n11.00 at night. I would not doubt that a party without music would, for\nmany, be very boring, as they are not great conversationalists at the\nbest of times, but does this noise\nreally have to begin at around 1 0 0\ndecibels and increase in direct proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed? Why should it be that Iam getting\non average the threat of one indictment each week either from the\narea around the college or from the\narea around the Hamlet gardens\nflats?? I fail to see why I should be\ncalled from my bed at 12.00 midnight to quiet ena\" Party\" in Hamlet\ngardens, and when Iphone the flat\nthere is noone on the other end of\nthe phone who is capable of answering the question \" Can Is peak to\nsomeone in charge of the party\". In\nfact one evening last week I spent\nalmost 20 minutes trying to get through to the organisers of a party\nin Hamlet gardens, and I got no other reply than from two drunken buffoons on the other end of the line\ntrying to chat each other up. This\nwas, I might add after 12.00 mid-night.\nIt might seem obvious to most\nsensible students that my accusations are only aimed at that absolute\nminority who seem incapable of conducting their lives in an adult man ner.\nAs a final note to all, by all means have a good time and get the best\nfrom your time in University, but for\ngoodness sake, PLEASE consider those around you, both your fellow\nstudents, your neighbours, and also those who are working for the good of the students within the college( ie. Cleaners etc.)., Unless some drastic re-thinking\non behalf of the organisers of parties etc. is done, the only solution\nwill be for the Union to take disciplinary action against those people who are spoiling the lot of the rest\nof the student body. It is unjust for\na minority to influence decisions against the majority.\nAs a plea to all the students of the college, it is in your own interest to\nprevent other students from causing a disturbance in any way. The only\nreal way of maintaining discipline is\nfor every student to act as a disc ip line officer, and keep things under\ncontrol. PLEASE HELP US TO HELP YOU. NORM. "

Frances the NUS Press\nOfficer asked a policeman how many people\nhe estimated were on\nthe demo, his reply was\n\" about10,000.\" However when he saw her\ngo into a telephone box\nto make a call he dived\nin after her and presuming her to be a journalist said that if she was\ncalling her newspaper\nthen she'd better say\n7 , 0 0 0 !\nThe Guardian's reporter was not waylaid in\nthis way and said that\nabout 1 0 , 0 0 0 students\nwere there.\nIC was singularly\nwell represented there\nwith a massive turn-out\nof 15, well done, that's one in the eye for St.\nJohn Stevas!\nAfter all the exhortations from Pres. Norm Sayles in last week's Purple Patch, to make\nsure the demo is well supported, NONE of the\nUnion Exec, joined the\ndemo.\nStudents must realize\nthat the NUS leadership\nin the coming period\nwill fight tooth and nail\nto head off any struggle\nwhich must of necessity\nbecome a fight against\nthis Government. This will be further borne out\nby their motions and amendments in the NUS Margate Conference.\nHIGHER GRANTS FOR\nPOSTGRADUATES\nSign the Petition!\nWe, as members of\nimperial College, feel\nthat we must add our\nvoice to those who have\nspoken up about the\npresent anomaly of the\nPost Graduate grant.\nFor Post Graduates in\nLondon, the problem is\nparticularly acute. Ever\nsince the London\nweighting was abolished\nin 1 9 6 2 by the upgrading of the award for all\nother PG students in\nthe country, the real\nvalue of the award has\nbeen a I lowed to fa 1\n1 to\nthe point where London\nPG students are unable\nto live within their\nmeans.\nThe Ashby report of\n1 9 6 2 stated that the PG grant should be sufficient\nto allow aPG student to\nenjoy a standard of living higher than that of\na typical undergraduate.\nAll we ask is that the\nPG grant be tied to the\nUG grant by the ratios\nproposed by NUS, so\nthat account is taken for\nthe fact that PG students\nhave to pay for food,\nclothing and accommodation for all 52 weeks of the year. This should\nallow aPG to enjoy the\nsame standard of living\nas aUG as well as automatically providing a London weighting, a benefit enjoyed by all\nother members of the\nUniversity.\nThose who state that\nthe present low level of\ngrants is fair because\nthe PG grant is not\nmeans tested should remember that parents\nhave already financed\ntheir children for 3 years\nas UG' s. Surely this\nsupport should not be\nincreased to 6 years?\nPG students carry out\na major proportion of\nthe research carried out\nin British Universities.\nThis contribution should\nbe acknowledged by a major revision of the level of the grant for the\nnext t rien niu m. PETITION WORDING\nThe undersigned call\nupon the DES to make it\npart of their policy to\ninclude a London allowance in the awards to all\npersons studying for\nhigher degrees who are\nregistered as students of\nthe colleges and schools\nof London University\nand all colleges in the\nGreater London area.\nThis is a copy of a petition for higher postgraduate grants. It is to\nbe signed by all ICPGS\nand hopefully by Sir\nBrian as well. Ten For the attention of\nMess rs. Corbyn, East\nand Ve all: \u2014\nWhat does CEF E consider are a person's basic rights? Does the\n\" freedom\" of socialism allow a man freedom to\nhold bis own idealism,\ne.g. have a religion\n(which a socialist should\nconsider reactionary and\nillusory.)\nIf the answer is \" yes\" then explain the action\nof all known communist regimes against ideal-ism.\nIf the answer is \" no\" then please explain\nwhether (a) socialism is\nan idea! around which men must be moulded, i.e. claiming to be absolute truth therefore ideal-ism); (b) socialism is an\nideal to be moulded by\nman, the material world etc.\nMAURICE MOLONEY\nEditor's reply to the open\nletter to CEFE\nCEF E's ideas of a person's basic rights are\nsomewhat confused as\nthey have no concept of\n\" democratic rights\", i.e. those rights which have\nbeen won by the working class in the course of\nstruggle like the right to\nstrike, the right to a free\nnationalised health ser-vice, the right to a decent standard of living,\netc. There are no such\nthings as rights as\nthings in themselves,\nonly rights that are won in continual struggle\nagainst the exploiting\nclass, and that are only\ndefended in further\nstruggle, which in certain periods, must assume a revolutionary\ncharacter and result in\nthe overthrow of the exploiting class and the\nsetting up of the dictatorship of the exploited\nclass.\nFreedom \u2014 ? What is\nfreedom? Is freedom the\nability to jump out of a tenth storey window? No, \" freedom is the\nappreciation of necessity\" as Engels put it,\nand by that he meant\nthat subject as we are to\nlaws of nature, e.g. grav-it y, disease, etc., freed om is the recognition\nof the necessity of those\nlaws, i.e. of their objective character. It is by\nrecognising the necessity of the law of grav-it y,i. e. its action independent of our will, that\nenables us to \" overcome\" it by the use of\naeroplanes, etc., i.e. by\nthe recognition of further necessities (laws) of\nnature.\nEngels writing the\nintroduction to the\n\" Civil War in France\" by\nKarl Marx points out that\nthe Communards( of the\nParis Commune of 1871)\ncorrectly abolished all\nfinks between the church and the state: they realised \" that in relation to\nthe state, religion is a purely private matter\".\nThat is of course completely necessary \u2014 the\nidealist philosophies\nspring historically out of\nscarcity and play an\nextremely reactionary\nrole in any political situation and cannot therefore be supported by a workers' state. As socialism alone can release\nand co-ordinate the presently available productive power and abolish\nscarcity \u2014 idealism will disappear in a similar\nway to the early Chartist\nmovement which sprang\nout of poverty and ended\nthrough prosperity.\nIn the schools, of\ncourse, a dialectical\nmaterialist approach will be used towards every\nsubject and the only religion that will be taught\nwill be comparative religion taught in a dialectical materia I ist approach as part of man's social pre-history.\nThe communist reg-ime's action against religion as \" exposed\" in\nthe current issue of\n\" Voice' arises out of\nthe need to combat any\nreturn to idealism in\ntimes of Hardship during\nthe period of the dictatorship of the proletariat\n\u2014 for that will not solve\nthe problems.\nThe present \" com munis:.\" regimes are not\neven socialist in the\nmarx s: sense of the\nword end have to be\ndescribed scientifically\nas degenerated workers'\nstates, where the Stalinist bureaucracies are in a similar position between\nthe West and the Eastern working class as the\nTrade Union bureaucracy in this country is\nbetween the Tories and the British working class.\nArising out of that\neconomic position (the\nStalinist bureaucracy)\nonly certain economic gains are possible and these are only limited\nones. This produces a lessening of the gains of the working class( than\nare actually possible)\nand also because this\nnaturally involves not\nfighting for an understanding of dialectical\nmaterialism within the\nworking class \u2014 ideal ism gains a hold and has\nto be viciously sup-pressed.\nAlthough the answer\nis in a limited sense\n\" yes\" your conception\nof socialism is (of\ncourse) incorrect. Socialism is not an ideal in\nthe sense of a Utopia. It\nis a stage of social\norganisation of mankind which is necessary\nto run the present productive for css and develop them further. It is no\nmore permanent than\nwas feudalism or slave\nsocieties or the capitalist mode of commodity production.\nThe urgency of the\nfight for socialism today\narises out of the economic crisis, caused by\nthe contradictions inherent within capitalism,\nwhich must ro solve itself in fascism or social-ism.\nHaving ^rasped t'~ at\nand decided upon fig. ting for socialism, then\nthe means, tactics, strat-e gy, etc., for that fight\ncan only be arrived at\nout of a dialectical materialist approach to the\nclass struggle and its\nhistory.\nAll other means result\nin fascism.

I enclose a list of\nthose books which are\nuseful to Black South\nAf ri can sch o ol chi Id ren.\nThe LM F can arrange for\ntheir transportation to\nSouth Africa and could\ncollect books sent to a station in London; the\nIMF will also pay for\ntransportation costs within this country.\nThe facts about books\nin schools in South Afr ica are as follows: in\n1 9 6 8 \u2014 R14.48 per A fri can pupil was allocated.\nR228.00 per white pupil;\nsometimes 4 African pupils share 1 textbook;\nin many schools there is\nno library at all; as a re-sul t,1 in 2 4 0 African pupils reaches matriculation;1 in12,000 receives a university deg-ree.\nI think you will therefore feel that this work\nis of major importance,\nto arrest or minimise the\nevil effects of the system\nof apartheid in South\nAfrica. We would very\nmuch like to hear from\nyou if you are able to\ntake part in the scheme.\nYours sincerely,\nPIC TON V.M BATHA, Acting Director.\nBOOKS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL LIBRARIES Science\nPhysics Topics Series (Longmans, 1969)\nChemistry Background series, ed.

In order to break the\nworking class from ref or mis m it is\" necessary\nfor it to learn through\nexperience that the\nrights and living standards of the masses today can no longer be defended by reformist\nmeasures.\nThat is why we call\nfor the return of a Labour Government pledged\nto socialist policies (na-t ional is ation of the ma jor industries under\nworkers' control and without compensation,\nnationalisation of the\nbanks, major finance\nhouses and land, withdrawal of British troops\nfrom Northern Ireland,\netc.).\nWe as well as you understand fully that the\nLabour Government will be incapable of introducing such measures,\nwhich are the only ones\nthat can resolve the present econom'ic crisis with out mass unemployment,\nclosure of industry, total erasure of the rights\nof the working class; a third WorldWar etc., i.e. all the historical ways that capitalism drags itself out of economic crises and in doing so paves the way for the\nnext.\nBut\npose \"\nto\nthe\nsimply \" ex Labour Party\nwithout the building of\nan alternative Revolutionary Party would be\nthe grossest betrayal of\nthe working class and is\nof course an antithesis\nto the concept of leader-ship.\nThat is why we transformed the socialist\nLabour League into the\nWorkers Revolutionary\nParty on Sunday, November 4th at the Odeon,\nHammersmith. This involved a mass\ncampaign of training in\nMarxism and recruitment throughout the\ncountry in the months\nbefore the (transform a tion, to give a lead to\nthose layers of the working class and students\nwho were already experiencing the treachery\nand betrayals of the\npresent Labour leaders,\nto turn them back into\ntheir factories and colleges to fight for revolutionary politics as the\nonly way to defend one's democratic rights.\nSimply to \" try to\nbring real revolutionary\npolitics to the working\nclass\" is meaningless\nWithout the construction\nof a Revolutionary Party,\nsteeled in Marxism as\nthe theory of knowledge\nof the class struggle,\nfighting against bureaucratic distortions and revisionism, with the\naim of taking the working class to power.\nI in no way \"reject\nlearning through practice\" as you state and I do not say that the student body has already\nlearnt that reformism\nleads to defeat, I simply\npointed out that this\nwas the lesson of the\ngrants campaign so far and should be conned\nby vote and actualized in\nthe building of a new, revolutionary Ieadership\nin NUS to ally with the\nworking class in a political fight to bring down the Tories.\nTo call the5% grant\ncut that we received\ndue to the \u00a320 increase\ninsult we received from\nthe Tories \" not a defeat\" is to completely distort\nthe meaning of the word, and leads one to adopt\nthe political position\nthat the Stalinist NUS leadership did not betray\nthe willingness to fight\nof the 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 who mobilized in support of\nthe grants campaign.\nThe 5 % grant cut constitutes a further\nattack on our living stan\ndards by the Tory Gov eminent and one which cannot be tolerated in\nview of the current in creasing rate of inflation\nwhich will \"necessitate\nfurther attacks as the\neconomic crisis deep-ens.\nOwing to the complete lack of any political position that you hold being stated in your\nletters, your criticisms\nof the Y SSS and SLL are\nof an eclectic unproductive nature which is borne out by your comments on democratic\ncentralism in the SLL. I trust you will forward\nnames, documents or\nany other form of proof\nfor your allegations or\nelse they will be reassigned to the growing\nheap of slander and libel\nthat is fast being produced by enemies of the\nworking class.\nI refer you to Lenin's\" Left Wing Communism \u2014 an Infantile Disorder\" if you are still unclear\nabout our position of returning a Labour Government pledged to socialist policies.\nIf you were to state\nyour political position\n(for your references to\nGerry Healy show that\nyou are not unknown to\nrevolutionary politics)\nthen this correspondence could continue in\nan enlightening productive manner, and would also elucidate any ideas\nI might harbour about\nyour signature being a pseudonym.\nQuote Red Weekly:\"... a reader in the USA Who tells us that we are\nthe best English language left-wing paper\naround.

Accordingly, the R.A.T.T. has\nnot been designed to be a medium for publicity or\ninstant communication.\nThat is a job for Felix\nand S.T.O.I.C. It is, however, largely a \"self-help\" system for\nmost of the things that\nmost students want to\nfind out about.\nWhat Is There?\nI.C. Travel Bureau to\nshare the counter space\nwith N.U.S. Endsleigh Insurance.\nMr.E. Meacock, who\norganises the Careers Library in College Block has\nsent across to the Union a good deal of literature\nabout future careers. This\nis not intended in any\nway to replace the fuller\nselection over in the Careers Library in the College Block, but is aimed\nat those students who do not have any specific career aims, but want to\nbrowse around in an in formal atmosphere, and\nonly go to the Careers\nLibrary when they have a specific request: The Careers Section will be\nsupplemented by more\ndisplay racks to be supplied by Mr. Meacock.\nBrian Childs, the Accommodation Officer, will\nbe putting up the addresses of flats for those of\nyou wanting to change\nflat/digs. Hopefully, he\nwill be displaying literature to guard you against\nthe legal hassles you may\ncome across.\nFor those of you who\ndon't particularly want to\nlook for any information,\nbut just browse, there is\n40 foot drop\nto quad\nSR Dl TOP J FLOOR rJ q fj DJ Careers Information\nAccommodation\nInformation\nplus magazines,etc.,\nfor anyone to\nbrowse through\n( to IC Cheap 'Reoorclf\n/^^nds lei c quite a lot of reading\nmatter up there. The Union subscribes to many\nother societies, and often\nreceives magazines, etc.\nfrom them. This is where\nyou can find them.\nComfy chairs and sofas\n(Never mind the age,\njust look at the quality)\nand a coffee machine are\nprovided (Follow the instructions on the coffee\nmachine explicitly!).\nWhat else can the room be\nused for?\nFm not sure the room\nshould be used for \" wild\" boozy parties, but more\nsober events are ideally\nsuited to the room.\nMeetings, mini-lectures\nor talks, would be welcome to use the room,\nwhich will be book able via Jen. Really, it'sup to\nyou, you've got the room\nthere, use it!\nProspects?\nI think we are all in favour of fully using the\nUnion Building, and it\nmay seem that at this\nstage in the year, you could well say that no-one\nreally knows where the\nroom is, what it's for, or\nhow people can be persuaded to use it. To be\nquite honest, I don't really\nexpect it to get off the\nground this year, not even\nnext year, but eventually\nit will happen. Students\naren't patient as a rule\nbut for this to work, you'll\njust have to be! The problem of students not knowing where the room is will\nbe solved in October next\nsession. The Registry is\nalways overcrowded in\nthe first 3 days of an academic year, with the twofold problem of registration plus associated enquiries and the issue of\ngrant cheques.\nI have arranged for the\nRegistry to give out grant\ncheques via the counter\nfacilities in the R.A.T.T. In case you forget this\nroom after this desperate\nvisit for your cash, you may require an N.U.S. card. Those will be also\navailable from the\nR.A.T.T. for two and a half weeks after the\ncheques have been issued.\nThen, most oe ople will\nknow where the room is\nand what it's for.\nBelow are a few words\nfrom a few of the\nR.A.T.T. participants.
