After the release of\nThe Joshua Tree album last year came\na mammoth world tour, followed by\nthe release of Rattle and Hum the\nalbum, Rattle and Hum the book, and\nnow comes Rattle and Hum the\nmovie.\nIs U2 being rammed down our\nthroats? Are we getting a little sick\nof Lf2? For me, this film just cements\nI72's standing as the world's foremost rock group.\nWhat is this movie about? 'It's a musical journey', exclaims Larry\nMullen Jr, somewhat unsure of\nhimself. But that is all it really is, and\nit doesn't pretend to be anything\nelse. It is a well made concert film\nwith brief moments of life on the\n\u2022road with the band, with concert\nfootage interspersed amongst the\nsongs. With concert footage taken\nduring the group's Joshua Tree tour\nof the US last year, the movie was\ncreated to give Lf2 fans the best seat\nin the house from which to\nexperience a172 concert. And it is\nquite a treat for any fan. With songs\nmostly from The Joshua Tree and The\nUnforgettable Fire, the music is loud,\npowerful and passionate-traditional ingredients to the\ngroup's appeal.\nAn annoying aspect of the film is\nthat it is mostly shot in black and\nwhite, but this does give it an\ninformal, documentary style\npresentation, making the band seem\nmore accessible.\nWe aren't given the opportunity*\nto explore the minds of the\nindividuals making up the group, or\ndelve into their personalities. But,\nColors\nthe few snippets we are treated to\nare significant ones, and there are\nsome gems that stand out. We see\nthe band in awe of a Harlem gospel\nchoir giving a row sing rendition of\n7 Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking\nFor; we see the great old man of\nblues guitar\u2014BB King\u2014playing with\n1\n7\n2 and professing 'I can't stand\nplaying chords'. We see an\nemotional Larry Mullen at\nGracelands and his obvious disgust\nat seeing his hero Elvis' grave 'in his\nback yard'. The band go to the\nhistoric Sun Studios at Memphis\nwhere they record five songs in five\nhours\u2014the songs, they say, that\nkept them going, on the long tour.\nHowever, there is nothing here\nindicating the band as anything out\nof the ordinary. Indeed, for the most\npart the band come across as the\nIn L.A., it is now reaching the point\nwhere it will be required for tourists\nto know which colours to wear in\nwhich area, in order to avoid death.\nDennis Hopper's film attempts to\nanalyse a problem which is daily\nspiralling into more mindless\naverage, pretty dim, lads next door\nthat are suddenly propelled to\nsuper stardom; which is a little\nirritating to those of us who know\nthem to be a cut above the rest of\nthe pop crowd. However, the\nturning point comes late in the film\nin blazing colour, and the effect is\nstunning. It is when politics rears its\nhead that the real 1\n7\n2 emerge, with\nattacks on South Africa, the wars in\nCentral America, and in particular,\na moving condemnation of the IRA.\nTaken just after the Inniskillen\nviolence and more deaths, and also\nassesses the police's impossible task\nof trying to tackle it.\nThe film begins promisingly as\nHopper draws us into a world of\ngangland violence and, through the\nlives of two new partners; one\nexperienced and diplomatic (Robert\nDuvall), who believes in the softly,\nsoftly approach, and the other (Sean\nPenn) who is young, vigorous and\nfirmly believes in the strong arm of\nthe law.\nHowever, the film soon\ndegenerates into just another buddy\nmovie as it concentrates too much\non the partnership and discards the\npotential of the title subject.\nAlthough Duvall is as reliable as\never and Penn reminds us that he\nused to be a very competent actor\nbefore becoming a full-time press\nbas her, they can't really do much\nmore with a script that fails to get\nto the heart of the subject. The\ndirection too, lacks inspiration and\nis often unoriginal, which is\nsurprising and disappointing\ncoming from a director like Hopper.\nHowever, having said this, the\nfilm does have its scenes, more\nnotably towards the end and\nHopper's nihilistic view that the\npolice can't win no matter what they\ndo, survives to make a strong point.\nNoel Curry.\nbombing, Bono's anger at the 'glory\nof the revolution' followed by\nSunday, Bloody Sunday is a pivotal\nmoment of the film.\nWith All I Want is You rolling over\nthe credits, ends a film that should\nbe a satisfying experience for all 1\n7\n2\nfans.\nI, for one, am eagerly awaiting\ntheir next venture. Hopefully,\nthough, we'll be spared The Making\nof Rattle and Hum.\nSumit Guha.\n\"A The Greatest\nStory Never Told\nTony Husband, Corgi, \u00a32.99.\nWalk into any bookshop and browse\nthrough the humour shelves and\nyou'll discover a plethora of flimsy\nbooks crammed with cartoons of\none dec rip tion or another. They are\noften themed, or try to be, and\ndespite an incredible amount of\nwork by the cartoonist, are almost\nalways overpriced.\nHere's another one. Readers of;\nPunch or Private Eye would recognise\nTony Husband's style if not his\nname. He has won awards as\nCartoonist of The Year three times,\nand I must say that basically it's because he is funny. I found this\nlatest collection hilarious in places.\nI also found it confusing, since it's subject is the Bible, and I don't confess to knowing the Good Book\ntoo well. Some of the jokes were lost\non me. But the many that weren't were pretty good, funny and\nslightly cruel.\nBeing a pretty devout athies tI was\nwary of recommending this though.\nSo I asked a few people, Christian\nand otherwise to look it over and tell\nme if it's offensive. The consensus\nwas that it is not if you don't take\nit seriously, and anyone who has a sense of humour isn't very likely to.\nSo, The Greatest Story Never Told is\nall set for anonymity in the endless\nranks of overpriced Christmas\nstocking fillers. Just be careful who\nyou give it to.\nAndrew Clarke.\nPage 22 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Science\n\"/A/ THE\nWith America back in the space\nrace, Russia about to launch 'her'\nspace shuttle, and pollution a highly\ntopical subject at the moment, most\npeople are unaware of the\nenormous amount of 'space\npollution' orbiting the Earth.\nThe North American Air System\n(NORAD) currently have 6194\ntrack able objects, tennis-ball size or\nabove, on their computer system,\nand of these only about 300 are\noperating satellites! In addition to\nthis, they estimate that there are\nanother 40,000 golf-ball sized objects\nthat are not track able. The debris\n' ranges from paint flecks, nuts and\nbolts and fragments of exploded\nsatellites to hand tools that have\nslipped from the gloves of\nastronauts!\nThe majority of space debris\ncomes from the explosion of space\nrocket stages and satellites.\nApproximately 80 explosions have\nbeen caused by the combustion of\nspent rocket casings and the\ndeliberate explosions for space\nweapons testing.\nUnplanned explosions of rocket\nstages have occurred years after the\nlaunch; some fifteen Soviet Proton\nand US Delta and Titan rocket\nshrouds are known to have burst\nspontaneously in orbit. The thin\ncasing that separates fuels corrodes\nin the harsh environment, the fuels\nmix and explode. Delta shrouds lay\ndormant for about three years, and\nin keeping with its performance on\nthe ground, even Arianne has\nexploded after spending a year in\norbit!\nDeliberate explosions in space\nhave been occurring since the 1950s when the US exploded warheads in\nlow orbits. Ballistic missile and\nanti satellite tests are thought to have\ninjected 10 million pieces of debris\ninto low and high orbits.\nOn September 13, 1985, a functioning solar research satellite,\nSolwind, was destroyed by an\nexperimental anti satellite missile.\nNORAD showed that the debris\nformed a300 mile dust cloud\ncontaining 300 track able pieces.\nAfter this test, Congress prohibited\nanti satellite tests against objects in\nspace? however, in September 1986,\ntwo satellites were blown up as part\nof a SDI test.\nEven if no further refuse were\ngenerated intentionally or by\naccident, the flurry of fragments\nalready in orbit might spawn more\ndebris. NASA scientists believe that\nthe large velocities at which space\nparticles collide (about 8 to lO km/s) could be destructive enough to\ngenerate hundreds or even\nthousands of additional particles.\nThe proliferation of these particles\ncould snowball into a chain reaction\nwith other satellites or particles,\nwith the result being a debris belt\naround the Earth. Should this debris\ntear into a discarded satellite still\nmore debris would be generated,\nincreasing the potential for\ndestruction.\nThe Soviets have dumped 3000\npounds of old nuclear-powered\nsatellites in a600 mile orbit, 'A hyper velocity collision with a spent\nSoviet nuclear reactor may generate\nas many as one million particles of\na diameter of one millimetre or\nmore', says Nicholas Johnson of\nTeledyine-Brown Engineering.\nNASA has been particularly\nworried about the space debris\n1984 when Challenger astronauts\nretrieved the ailing Solar-Maximum\nSatellite. Detailed micro-photographs revealed that the\naluminium casing was create red by\nthousands of impacts, the largest by\nmiles a marble-sized object would\ntake a year, at 500 miles, 30 years,\nand at 800 miles, a mission-threatening 300 years!\n'At 300 miles, the typical altitude\nfor space stations, orbiting\ntelescopes, and other satellites, you\nare definitely in a spec e debris\nenvironment', says Donald\nKressler, NASA Orbital Debris\nspecialist at Houston.\nGraphic evidence of the damage\nthat can be done was discovered in\na particle of at least 1mm diameter.\nFrom the density of cratering,\nscientists have estimated that the\nflux density of space debris is\ncomparable to that of natural\nmicro meteorites. The Hubble Space telescope,\nscheduled for launch next year, has\na projected 17-year operational\nlifetime, but may not survive to\ncarry out its full mission. Michael\nSharva of the HST Institute in\nthreat since June 1983, when a stamp-sized paint fleck cracked the\nwind shield of the space shuttle,\nChallenger; an impact equivalent to\na ten pin bowling ball travelling at\n60 miles per hour! Other satellites\nbelieved to have been battered by\ndebris include the Soviet Kosmos\n1275, the European GEOS-2 and a US balloon satellite.\nContrary to popular belief, space\nis not self-cleaning, although\natmospheric drag does eventually\ncause objects to re-enter the\natmosphere. At an alt it ute of 180\nmiles, debris can take from several\ndays to 9 months to re-enter; at 300\nMaryland estimates a1 per cent\nchance of being destroyed by debris\nduring its lifetime. For a billion-dollar investment, such odds are not\nattractive. The Hubble Space\nTelescope will be put into a low\nEarth orbit, and its cross-section of\n172 square feet and lack of thrusters\nmake it a very likely target. Sharva\nhas calculated that there is a0.1% chance of cill is on with an object of\nabove lm; NASA will know days in\nadvance if debris will impact, and\nbeing unable to manoeuvre, will be\nable to do nothing about it!\nEven ground based astronomy\nhas not escaped from the space\ndebris threat. The atmosphere is a very poor optical medium; large\nobjects such as MIR and the Space\nShuttle are visible with the naked\neye. Others are fainter, but easily\ndetected by sensitive photographic\nemulsions used in\nastro photography. Most space\ndebris in low earth orbit is only\nvisible for a few hours after dusk or\nbefore dawn, but pieces of spent\nrockets and broken satellites in\ngeostationary orbit (22,300 miles\nabove the Earth), pose a more\ndifficult problem, because the clutter\nis visible for most of the time, and\nhas an infinitely long decay period.\nAlthough Kressler estimates that the\nproblem will not become serious for\nanother 25 years, optical\nastronomers differ in their views of\nhow the debris a ffe q fs their work.\nRadio astronomy, unaffected by\nthe time of day, does not escape.\nReflections from debris can wipe\ncomplete bands from the spectrum\nat a time. Astronomers were given\na glimpse of this, when, in 1961, the\nUSAF launched the 'Needles'\nproject\u2014releasing billions of copper\nneedles into orbit to create a dipole\nbelt around the Earth, to act as a mirror. These needles were\nsupposed to re-enter in early 1966,\nalthough a few clumps are still\nthought to be in orbit.\nWhat then of the future? When\nwill the first mission fail as a result\nof a coll is on with space debris\u2014or\nwill a clean-up operation be initiated\nbefore such a disaster occurs?\nSeveral 'space dustbins' have been\nproposed\u2014the trash removal and\nsatellite hauler 1 (TRASH 1)\nproposed by SpaceTech Inc, or a debris catcher with a huge scoop,\nmiles in diameter are just two\nsuggestions.\nBut as with most problems,\nprevention is better than cure, and\nseveral ideas are being investigated.\nThe airforce want to use more\n'disposable orbits' in low Earth\norbits, which speed up re-entry\ntimes. Satellites are more modular,\nthus reducing the number of\nexterior nuts and bolts and a new\nNASA operational procedure\nensures that all rocket fuel is burnt\nup eliminating the problem of\nexploding rocket casings.\nPage 10 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

The move\nto high technology means a loss of\n20,000 jobs in military related work\nin Britain between 1981 and 1985,\ndespite an increase in our share of\nthe global arms market. Arms\nthemselves don't even make\neconomic sense, since once made\nthey can generate no further wealth.\nBut detailed plans for converting\nmilitary industry to socially useful\nproduction have been dismissed out\nof hand by industry and by\ngovernments of both main parties.\nWhy this reluctance in the W to put an end to the arms trade? Are\narms companies just satisfying a \"market need\"? For a start, the\nworld economy is grossly distorted.\nDespite gaining official\nindependence from colonial masters\nin the years after 1945, most\ndeveloping nations find themselves\nlocked into a system in which they\nare suppliers of raw materials and\nthe consumers \u2022 of western\nmanufactures. The main global\neconomic powers are the\ngovernments of the rich\nindustrialised nations and\ntransnational companies (TNCs).\nThe TNCs like to invest in countries\nwith low production costs and\nwhere they control the profits. Third\nWorld elites sympathetic to TNCs\ntend to be those most willing to\nalign with the strategic interests of\nwestern governments. A good\nexample is Malaysia, where\napproximately 50% of\nmanufacturing output is controlled\nby TNCs.\nBut the profit driven business L. arms export doesn't even stick to\nthis strategic and economic logic.\nBritain was selling arms to\nArgentina up to eight days before\nthe invasion of the\nMalvinas/Falkland Islands! The sad\nreality is that the arms trade is\nfuelled by the search for profits and\npower and works hand in hand\nwith governments such as our own.\nIts existence is totally opposed to the\nwell being of ordinary people. There\nhave been some limited successes\nwith campaigns against specific\narms deals and for some further\ninformation as to how to get\ninvolved with fighting the arms\ntrade contact the organisations listed\nbelow.\nAt the present time, a large\nproportion of science related jobs\nand funding remains with the MoD\nand companies like British\nAerospace, GEC, Marconi etc. It is\na matter of personal choice and\ncircumstance as to how you decide\nto deal with this fact. Nevertheless,\nto accept the status quo is to side\nwith the powerful.\nMalaysia\nOn the 27th September Dr Mahathir\nMohamad* the Malaysian Prime\nMinister, visited Mrs Thatcher at 10\nDowning Street to sign a Memorandum of Understanding for\nthe purchase of over \u00a31 billion worth\nof military equipment during the\nnext fifteen to twenty years.\nContracts with individual\nmanufacturers are being handled by\nthe Ministry of Defence's Defence\nExport Services Organisation\n(DESO). The details have yet to be\nworked out, but the equipment sold\nis understood to include:\n- a dozen Tornado fighter aircraft\nfrom BAe\n- twelve Rapier air defence missile\nsystems from BAe\n- 105mm light gums from Royal\nOrdinance (a BAe subsidiary)\n- about thirty FH70 towed howitzers\nfrom VSEL\n- electronics for the Tornados and air\ndefence radar from GEC Marconi\n- sonar, radar and communications\nequipment from Plessey\n- about 50 Javelin ground-to-air\nmissile launchers from Shorts\n- a refurbished Oberon class\nsubmarine\n- a training programme\n- contracts for naval construction\nand repair facilities in Malaysia.\nIt is not entirely clear why the\nMalaysian government should want\nto spend so much money on\nAfgan Rebel with US SA missile\nweaponry. In reply to an\ninterviewer's question, Dr Mahathir\ntold ITN that it was routine\nrearmament. Britain has been\nmaking strenuous efforts to sell\nmore arms to south east Asia, and\nthe DESO opened an office in Kuala\nLumpur in 1986.\nNo details have been given on any\ncredit terms, but Malaysia will be\npaying in oil, natural gas, and other\ncommodities, in a series of barter\ndeals. Overdraft fac i lites will\nprobably be provided by Britain as\na supplier of credit, and British\ncompanies will be encouraged to\ninvest in Malaysia. There are also\nreports that Malaysia wants more\naid money in return for the arms\ndeal. Britain does not give aid for\nmilitary purposes, but parallel talks\nare said to be taking place about an\nincrease in UK aid to Malaysia\nthrough the Overseas Development\nAdministration.\nDuring the past year in Malaysia,\nthe leader of the opposition and\nother political figures have been\ndetained without trial, dissidents\nwithin Dr Mahathir's party have\nbeen purged, newspapers have\nbeen closed, and six supreme court\njudges (including the most senior)\nhave been suspended. Although\nMalaysia has been one of the few\ndemocratic countries in south east\nAsia, two former Malaysian Prime\nMinisters are said to feel that Dr\nMahathir is abusing his power.\nNothing suggests that Mrs Thatcher\nraised the question of human rights\nduring the Downing Street meeting.\nConversion\nIn Britain, around 120,000 people\nare employed in manufacturing\nmilitary goods for sale abroad.\nCampaigning for an end to arms\nexports without considering those\nwhose jobs are affected would be\nirresponsible, hence the conversion\nof weapons factories to encompass\n\"socially useful\" output is\nencouraged.\nThere have been many attempts\nat conversion since the second\nworld war, both in Britain and\nabroad. Although there have been\nfew successes, most have proved to\nbe technically feasible, the main\nobstacle being lack of political will.\nMany of the initiatives for\nconversion have come from trade\nunionists who have been sufficiently\nforward looking to see that secure\nand satisfying jobs require long term\nchange. Unfortunately,\nmanagement prefers short term,\nguaranteed profits, so that weapons\nmanufacture, which offers low risks\nand has taxpayer sub sidi sed research and marketing, is very\nattractive.\nIn 1976, faced with prospects of\nredundancies, the Lucas Aerospace\nComfTine Shop Stewards\nCommittee (LACSSC) developed\nthe Alternative Corporate Plan to\nprotect the employees' right to work\nand to encourage the production of\nat least some socially useful goods.\nMeeting social needs rather than\ncreating profit was the main\nconcern, as with subsequent\nschemes at Vickers, British\nAerospace, Faslane and the GLC In\naddition, the Plan specified that all\nmembers of the workforce should\nhave real influence over the\norganisation of production by\nincreasing industrial democracy.\nIdeas for new products were\ncollected from the employees,\nleading to 150 proposals in a number of areas - transport,\nalternative energy sources, oceanic s,tele chi ric s( remote* control) and\nmedical equipment.\nThe management refused to meet\nthe Combine or consider the Plan.\nNeither the DTI, the Labour\ngovernment nor the TUC gave any\nassistance. In the following years,\nLucas closed factories and adopted\ndivide-and-rule tactics against the\nunions. Despite this, the Plan has\nbeen successful in that it has been\nthe inspiration for other schemes.\nContact addresses:\nCampaign Against the Arms Trade\n(CAAT),\n11 Goodwin Street,\nFinsbury Park,\nLondon N4 3HQ.012810297 Campaign Against Military\nResearch On Campus (CAMROC),\n190B Burdett Road,\nBow,\nLondon E3.\n01-980 2455\nPage 20 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

Perhaps if you just send\n| off thousands of application forms, someone will give you some sort o: \u2022a job which you might enjoy? No, better just ignore the problem. No,\n\" know, go and see the Careers Advisers, they'll tell you what to do.\nUnfortunately, we can't tell you\nwhat to do, we can help you\ntowards the decision, point you in\nthe right direction to get you started,\ntest out whether you're being\nrealistic but, ultimately the decision\nis yours. You're on your own on this\none! So where do you start? Well\nyou could stick a pin into every third\npage of the Graduate Recruitment\nProgramme booklet or you could try\nto be a bit more systematic about it.\nFirst of all, you could think about it\nyourself, try to compile a list of your\ncharacteristic traits, your values,\nwhat you want out of life and your\nskills, what you're good at, not\nforgetting, of course, those things\nthat interest you and that you enjoy.\nThen, when you look at job\ndescriptions, you can compare them\nwith your personal profile and see\nwhich ones match and, hey presto,\nyou know what you want to do\nnext.\nThe trouble is, it's not so easy to\nidentify all these things about\nyourself and so here's some tips as\nto how you might go about it. Look\nat your life so far. Why did you\ncome to Imperial College, why are\nyou reading Mathematics or Biology\nor whatever? What have you\nenjoyed out of the experience and\nwhy? What have you hated? Was\nthere anything in your holiday jobs\nthat you found fun or that you\ndiscovered you were particularly\ngood at? How about leisure\ninterests, any clues there? If you\ncan't do it this way round, try\nlooking at the jobs first. Read as\nmany job descriptions and adverts\nas you can and when you spot one\nthat takes your fancy, try and\nanalyse what it is that attracts you\nand then you can look for other\noccupations containing these\nfactors. Perhaps you've seen or\ntalked to people whose jobs seem\ninteresting. Why, what was it about\nthat job? Your Careers Adviser can\nhelp you with this task or an aly ising your skills and needs by asking\nquestions and checking out whether\nyou really mean it when you say, for\nexample, that all you care about is\nbecoming a millionaire by the time\nyou're 30!\nThere are brief descriptions in the\nback of the Directory 'ROGET', but\nfor more detailed descriptions,\nconsult the series of booklets\npublished by the Association of\nGraduate Careers Advis >ry\nServices, all available free of charge\nfrom the Careers Library.\nIf you find all this totally\nimpossible and your Careers\nAdviser can't help you get started\non the trail, then you may be\nrecommended to complete a Gradscope Questionnaire which is\na fiendishly clever little toy. You\nanswer fifty questions and the\ncomputer programme comes up\nwith your top fen jobs....but alas\nyou've still got to answer the\nquestions: What are you good at?\nWhat do you enjoy? What do you\nwant to do next?\nHave you enjoyed yourself so\nmuch as a student that you're\nthinking of going on to take a further qualification? There are\nmany reasons for continuing your\nstudies but merely having enjoyed\nyour undergraduate years may not\nbe an adequate motive. Being a postgraduate may turn out to be\nvery different from being an\nundergraduate. Are the elements of\nyour undergraduate life that you\nhave enjoyed still present at\npostgraduate level?\nAnother pretty pathetic reason for\ntaking a further course is because\nyou can't think of anything else to\ndo or because this careers choice\nbusiness is just too difficult. What's going to make it easier to think of\nsomething else, or to decide after\nanother year or three at College? If\nyou just continue to study and take\nno active steps toward the dreaded\nfuture, you'll find yourself in exactly\nthe same dithering situation, only\nslightly older!\nBut beware, the worst reason of\nall is falling prey to flattery. You\nmay feel that you're not susceptible\nbut come June, when your degree\nresults are out and notable\nprofessors ask if you'd like to do a PhD with them, it's so easy to be\noverwhelmed by the ideas, without\nthinking out the reality. Should this\nhappen to you, beware false pride.\nBeware the professors have reasons\nof their own for wanting PhD\nstudents and before jumping onto\na three year project, weigh up the\npros and cons and analyse whether\nit's really the right move for you.\nBefore you get the impression that\nI'm totally against postgraduate\nstudies, here are some more positive\nreasons for this course of action.\nYou may simply not feel finished\nwith studying and decide that you\nwant to learn more. Perhaps there's a part of your undergraduate course\nthat you have found particularly\ninteresting and would like to study\nin depth. Many a masters course\ncaters for this need, eg\nAstrophysics.\nThe most obvious reason is\nvocational. Your chosen career may\nrequire a PhD or a further\nqualification, eg research in the\nPharmaceutical industry or\nteaching. You may feel that it will\nbe easier to get a job in your chosen\nfield if you possess a further\nqualification, eg Geophysics or\nPetroleum Engineering. You may\nwish to change direction and\nanother course can often help, eg\nInformation Technology. Another\nword of caution is required here. It's easy to be misled into believing a course is more vocational than it\nreally is. Admissions tutors are sure\nto tell you how useful their courses\nare and so make sure you ask what\npercentage of their previous\nscholars are in employment and\nwhat they are doing. You might also\ncheck the value of your chosen\ncourse with some of the employers\nat the Careers Fair or discuss it with\na disinterested person like a Careers\nAdviser.\nHaving made the decision to\nprolong your student days, the\nobvious next step is to decide where\nyou want to study. The Careers\nOffice, Sherfield 309, keeps a reference copy of 'Graduate\nStudies' which lists all the PhD and\nMasters and many of the Diploma\ncourses available in the UK.

    "content": "Careers\nJournalism: the inside story\nIt's been a long time since\njournalism could be considered\nglamorous, and technical journalism\nitself has always played Cinderella\nto its television and newspaper\nbrethren. Once in a while the\nnationals find themselves in too\ndeep and dig the staff of specialist\npublications out of their little\ncupboards and put them into a chair\nto talk about the latest disaster.\nThe Piper Alpha explosion was\none such incident. Lost among the\njargon and market speak of the oil\nindustry, the nationals were forced\nto consult with the editors of the\nspecialist books who gleaned their\nallotted 15 minutes of fame.\nCynical though that view is,\njournalism of any kind still beats\nworking and in the technical market\nit can provide a narrow doorway\ninto the newspapers, radio and\ntelevision, if that is what you really\nwant.\nFor the science graduate, technical\nwriting provides the best entry into\njournalism as the one thing that\nevery technical publication is short\nof is technical people. The upshot of\nthis is that anyone leaving college\nwith anything approaching a science\nor engineering degree should not\nexperience any particular difficulty\nin finding a job.\nThe other traditional channel\u2014the\nlocal newspaper\u2014is practically\nclosed as it involves competing with\nschool leave rs or English students\nwho are by far the most favoured\nbreed in mainstream writing.\nAlthough it has long been ac liche, English is still considered the subject\nfor the budding journalist.\nSo, what does the editor of the\naverage technical book want?\nGenerally, the one thing that he or\nshe needs is some sort of feeling for\nthe magazine's subject matter rather\nthan any direct knowledge and it is\nvery rare that a particular degree\nwill have any direct relevance to\nwhat is happening to its related\nindustry.\nOn the one hand, it means that\npeople move from one area to\nanother fairly easily, but it also\nmeans that the science graduate is\njust as lost as the ex-English student\nwhen it comes to specific\ntechnologies. However, while\nemployers still believe that the ex-engineer is indispensable then the\nfield is largely clear for IC graduates.\nThe one other thing that the editor\nneeds is a writer. Although writing\nexperience will help, especially if\ngleaned on a magazine - college or\notherwise - it is by no means\nnecessary. Quite a few journalists in\nthe electronics field a e those who\ndrifted\" into the joh\nbecause it was\nsomething differ ert after working as\nan engineer for Plessey or Ferranti.\nMany did very little actual writing\nbefore joining and, after the odd\ntraining course and some on-the-job\nexperience, usually end up writing\nat least passable English.\nThe other criteria that the editor\ndecides by are usually the things\nthat any employer will cite:\npersonality, compatibility with other\nstaff, and interest.\nBut when you have found\nyourself a job at any of the\npublishers, what will you be doing?\nOne thing is for certain, most editors\ndo not see it as their role to be\ndigging up the dirt. Most material\ncomes in the form of a press release,\nor conference and occasionally from\nthe disgruntled telephone call when\nsomeone reveals that the entire\nmanagement team of a company\nhas been made redundant.\nHow the press release is used\ndepends largely on the magazine. In\nall areas, even those that are sold on\nnews stands, the books shake down\ninto three main types: the\nnewspaper; the technical features\nbook; and the product book. Many\nwill combine some of these parts,\nbut most are referred to as one\ncategory out of the three.\nAs long as it involves a new\nproduct or service, the product book\nwill take the press release as it\nstands and print it along with a telephone number for the company\nor with a \"bingo number\" to go on\na reply paid card. Many newspapers\nand technical books also incorporate\none of these sections.\nThe technical features book will\ntake the release and invite a member\nof the company to produce a feature\nor will do an in-depth look from the\nrelease. Usually the book will also\nprint reviews of products carried out\nby themselves or people in the\nindustry.\nThe newspaper represents the\nsharp end of the market since it\ninvolves a starting point for any\nnumber of different stories. The\nfinal article may be a re-run of the\nrelease or it may develop into\nsomething entirely different and\npossibly entirely wrong. How\ncritical the final piece turns out to be\ndepends on. the editor and,\nfrequently, on the in-house lawyer.\nIt is from the technical\nnewspapers that the nationals, as\nwell as radio and television, poach\ntheir science correspondents and\neditors. And so, if you want to end\nup on a daily that is the way to go.\nWith the exception of the training\ncourses at Morgan-Grampian and\nReed, the way to get in is to study\nthe Guardian every Monday for\nparticular jobs. Generally, you will\nbe aiming at job titles like reporter,\nstaff writer and assistant editor.\nEditorial assistant is probably one to\navoid as it is often a synonym for\ndogs body. If you can get hold of it,\nSo, who are you going to work for?\nAlthough there are a number of\nfields to get involved in, there are\nthree fields in which the sheer\nnumber of magazines make it much\neasier to move around: electrical and\nelectronic; computing and\ncommunications; and medical and\npharmaceuticals. Following up on\nthose are general engineering and\nindustrial books.\nThere are two major players in the\ntrade and technical market \u2014 Reed\nBusiness Publishing and MorganGrampian \u2014 with a number of\nmedium-sized and smaller\npublishing houses bringing up the\nrear. However, if its current spate\nof acquisitions continue then the\nnewly formed Maxwell Business\nCommunications will represent a third, but its final shape is far from\nsettled.\nReed represents the largest share\nof the market, with its portfolio\ncovering just about everything from\nfarming to computing. Its biggest\nmoney earner is probably Computer\nWeekly which has the third largest\ncirculation of any business\nmagazine, including news stand\nbooks like the Economist. Other\ntitles include Electronics Weekly,\nEuropean Chemical News,\nComputer Talk, Electronic and\nWireless World, Practical\nComputing and Systems\nInternational.\nAlthough based in a tower block\nout in Sutton, it is one of the better\npayers in the industry.\nMorgan-Grampian offers what is\nregarded as the best training\nprogramme around. However, it\nhas an odd portfolio that veers from\na trio of electronics publications\nthrough a couple of transport\nmagazines like Transport Week to\nthe Engineer, Process Engineering\nand Design Engineering.\nThe house is known in the\ntry a copy of UK Press Gazette;\nburied among the ads for Trout &\nSalmon Monthly and Shoe &\nLeather News there may be\nsomething interesting. The\nIndependent on Wednesdays is\nanother to look out for, though far\nless comprehensive than the\nGuardian.\nindustry for pioneering its series of\nWhat's New product magazines like\nWhat's New in Electronics and\nWhat's New in Computing.\nVNU is the UK subsidiary of one\nof the Netherlands' largest\npublishers and specialises in\nproducing computing magazines as\nwell as Family Circle. Its most\nfamous title must be Personal\nComputer World, and it also holds\nComputing, the magazine which\nonce threatened Computer Weekly\nfor leadership but is now losing out.\nPart of the success of Computer\nWeekly, however, has been the\ndemise of Computer News, one of\nCW Communications' titles. Part of\na worldwide network of computing\npublishers, CW is now left with\nDEC Today and PC Business World\namong others.\nEMAP is another house\nspecialising in personal computing\nland CADCAM with titles like\nCADCAM International and 3D. Its\nmajor title is PC User, the magazine\nwith which VNU's Personal\ni Computer World is having\nj something of a readership war\nI which is a little odd since PC User\n|is controlled circulation and PCW is\na news stand book. EMAP also may\nI be picking up the pieces of\nComputer News from CW.\nBased in Dartford, Findlays is\nreckoned to be the best payer in the\nmarket and carries Educational\nComputing and Eureka, a sort of\npaper Tomorrows World for\nengineers.\nAmong the rest are assorted\npublishing houses including\nTechpress, Angel, Hanover and\nEDA. However, they all have one\nthing in common: any publisher of\na decent size is based in London, so\nyou could be paying extortionate\nrents or commuting for four hours\nevery day for a very long time.\nWhere to work\nNovember 11 1988 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Careers\nEngineering in perspective\nGone are the days of being able to get up when you like and go to lectures\nif you want to. From now on it's five or maybe six days a week, every\nweek for the next forty odd years! This rather bleak view of full-time\nemployment is not intended to scare you, but it is often the image held\nby students, as I did, about working life. I now hope to dispel some of\nthese fears and enlighten you to some of the better points of life as an\nengineer and more generally as a professional person.\nI graduated from Brunei\nUniversity as a Mechanical Engineer\nin July 1988 and since then I have\nbeen employed by ICI Chemicals &\nPolymers Group in Teeside. In fact,\nI have been employed by ICI since\nthe age of 17 when I was successful\nin obtaining sponsorship for my thin\nsandwich course at Brunei. Having\nonly ever worked for one company\nmight have given me a blinkered\nview of engineering, but because of\nthe size and diversity of this\nparticular company, I would like to\nthink this is not the case.\nWhilst at Brunei I spent a total of\neighteen months on industrial\nplacements; two of the six month\nperiods were spent on Teeside, the\nother with ICU Brantham in Essex.\nSince joining full-time in July 1988\nI have spent three months with ICI\nAmericas in Wilmington, Delaware,\nUSA and I am now four weeks into\nmy job as Mechanical Technical\nSupport Engineer for one of the\nTerephthalic Acid plants on the\nWilton site, Teeside. Having done\na thin sandwich course, I was\nperhaps in a better position as a graduate recruit than some of those\nwho had come straight from full-time courses. The transition from\nstudent life to full-time employment\nI found it very\ndifficult, from an\ninterview, to discover\nwhat was on offer.\nis probably one of the most radical\nchanges in environment and\nattitude that anyone is likely to\nmake. As a result of spending time\nin industry between periods of\nacademic work, the two very\ndifferent approaches to engineering\nwere blended together well.\nA sound and comprehensive\nacademic training is essential in all\nprofessional jobs but the ways that\nyou apply this knowledge can vary\nconsiderably. It is this practical\napproach to engineering that is\nsadly lacking from all University and\nCollege courses and it is the first\nlesson you will have to learn as a graduate recruit.\nThe message which overrides all\nothers throughout the majority of\ncompanies in the UK, is 'Safety\nComes First'. At University only a passing word is mentioned with\nregard to safety but now everything\nI do revolves, and rightly so, around\nthat one word. The other big\nLife as an engineer is\nnot all roses.\ndifference between University and\nIndustry is responsibility, at\nUniversity it did not really matter if\nyou got one of your calculations\nwrong or your balsa wood bridge\nfailed because of poor design or you\nused the wrong glue. In industry,\nhowever, poor or careless design\ncan result in major incidents such as\nthe Hixborough disaster. Right from\nday one you are told: 'You will be\nheld responsible for your actions'.\nThis all sounds very dramatic, but\nit really is not as bad as it sounds.\nYou are not just thrown in at the\ndeep end and left to get on with it.\nThere are strict instructions and\nprocedures to follow and a veritable\n.plethora of 'experts' to help you\nmake the necessary decisions. I am\n\u2022 still in the process of an extensive\ninduction course which has been\ndesigned to introduce me to\neverybody I need to know in order\nto do my job effectively. When this\ninduction is over though my\ntraining is far from complete. My\ncareer path is carefully monitored by\na career working party to ensure I get the most from the company and\nthat the company gets the most out\nof me. I will receive continuous on\nthe job training as well as attending\nspecific courses to prepare me for\nthe next, more challenging\nplacement.\nAs Technical Engineer for a continuous plant, which runs 24\nhours a day, 7 days a week making\nTerephthalic Acid, I respond\ndirectly to the Maintenance\nManager, whose job it is to keep the\nplant running. I suppose the\nbroadest remit for my job is to\nimprove the long-term reliability\nand performance of the plant from\nan engineering stand point. The\nwork, despite the man-traps of\nsafety and procedure, is extremely\nvaried, always interesting and often\nchallenging. As well as providing\nthe technical input to a problem\nthere is also an element of man-management involved in the\nimplementation of the work. Manmanagement is another personal\nskill, which is not taught (if it can\nbe taught) at University or College,\nwhich is vital in industry if work is\nto be done properly, efficiently and\nsafely.\nThere is nothing wrong with the\nlarge cities such as Leeds and\nNewcastle. I was brought up on the\nSouth Coast and have spent the last\nfour years in London. Moving to\nTeeside in the North East of\nEngland has come as something of\na culture shock but you soon adapt\nto it. Again though, my sponsored\nindustrial placements in Teeside\nhave prepared me for this\npermanent move. Permanent is\nperhaps the wrong word because,\nas with many international\ncompanies, ICI may move me to one\nof the hundred odd sites in the UK\nor perhaps (hopefully!) to sites\nfarther afield.\nThere is one element of full-time\nemployment which I have not yet\nmentioned which, to some, is\nprobably the most important of all;\nthe money! Suddenly I have gone\nfrom being a poor student with four-figure overdraft to an engineer\nearning over \u00a31000 a month. The\noverdraft has not diminished any\nbut my standard of living has\nimproved considerably and my\nsocial life has become hectic to the\npoint of exhaustion.\nLife as an engineer is not all roses\nthough. A large chemical site on the\nedge of the North Sea can be a grim\nplace to work when it is minus ten\ndegrees with force five winds and\ndark by four o 'clock. The majority\nof engineers I know put a lot more\nthan 37V2 hours a week and are\noften here in the middle of the night\nor over the weekend.\nIn conclusion, I would say that if\nyou have been put off engineering\nby the work you are doing at\nUniversity, try the real thing before\nyou become a Merchant Banker in\nthe City.\nThis man eat too much muesli.\nNovember 11 1988 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "Alternative 1\nThinking about research? Research is just one of the options\navailable to a graduate, but it can be\none of the most rewarding.\nResearch need not just be carried\nout in the ivory towers of a university, it can just as well be\nperformed in the normal working\nenvironment. Indeed, one of the\nmost exciting areas yet to be\ndiscovered involves incredibly\nmundane equipment but is\nproviding insights into all areas of\nscience, including biology and\ncomputing.\nIn computing, for example, the\nrise of object orientated\nprogramming has given rise to the\nidea of using actual objects and\nmoving them to see the results.\nThis movement of objects forms\na new abstraction in the field of\nresearch with furniture representing\nthe ideas. At Pickfords R&D centre\nin Wokingham, researchers are\nlooking into how many fields of\nscience can be regarded in terms of\nfurniture movement.\nHowever, the project has already\nhit troubled waters: there are simply\nnot enough staff to do the moving.\nAccording to Professor van\nNostrand, \"The brains are willing,\nbut the limbs are weak. It is not\nenough to be bright, the likely\ncandidate must be able to lift a filing\ncabinet.\"\nAlthough short-staffed, the first of\nthe teams has started field trials in\nthe town. An assignment at 20\nLavender Avenue has developed\ninto a full-scale study of neural\nnetworks in the brain, and the\nlearning patterns involved when the\nnetwork is moved to 14 Acacia\nClose.\n\"It's all to do with the filling of the\ntea chests,\" explains Tom Hutter, a team member. \"Simply stuffing one\nfull of Duane Eddy records is not\nenough: too many and the equation\nbecomes too lopsided, not to\nmention impossible to carry.\"\n\"Also,\" adds Diane Warbrick, the\nteam's leader. \"The system is not\njust about where the objects are\nmoved to. The intervening process\ncounts as well.\"\nShe cites the necessary task of tea\nmaking in the process of removing\nfurniture: it calibrates the system for\nlater analysis. The tea should be\nmade in a large teapot and served\ninto whatever mugs are available\nafter all of the china has been\npacked. The mugs are then lost, as\nthey must not affect the eventual\nmove.\nLikewise, at least one vase and a leg from a great aunt's table should\nbe broken on crossing into the new\nhouse. This process serves to\nnormal is e any results obtained from\nthe analysis.\nNot enough can be made of\npacking the lorry for transport,\nwherein almost all of the team\nmembers stand in the road and\ndirect whoever is the youngest to\n\"put the wardrobe at the back with\nthe potted plants and mind the\ncrockery.\"\nEven though the project is still\nyoung, it has already yielded\npromising results, not least in\n'Diane Warbrick\nobserving the physiological effects\nof excessive tea consumption. \"It's bloody backbreaking,\" says\nWarbrick, \"But it's worth the aggro:\nI expect to have my first paper out\nby Friday.\"\n\n"

    "content": "News\nRents to increase\nThe Student Residence Committee\n(SRC) has set rent levels for next\nyear, with an average increase of\n10%. The new rents will leave the\nCollege's Residence account in debt\nby \u00a3400,000 by 1991, according to\nSenior Assistant Finance Officer,\nMalcolm Aldridge.\nThe rents were set under fierce\ndebate after IC Union President,\nNigel Baker expressed fears that\nstudents would be driven away\nfrom Imperial by rising\naccommodation costs. Speaking\nafter the meeting Mr Baker said the\nnew rents 'will never work.'\nMr Aldridge told FELIX that he\nwas 'concerned' over the matter and\nadded that 'If there really are a large\nnumber of students who cannot\nafford to come to Imperial then we\nare failing in our central function.'\nHe went on to say that he felt that\nstudents would continue to come to\nIC for the high academic standards\nand social life within London.\nThe increases come in the wake of\nRENTS DISCUSSED BY SRC* 9/11/88\n88/89 89/90\n\u00a3 \u00a3\nSouthside (Single) 40.00 44.03\nBeit Hall (New Hostel) 37.00 40.86\n(Old Hostel) 34.00 37.70\nFisher Hall (Single) 40.00 44.03\n(Double) 29.00 32.43\n(Triple) 21.00 23.99\nEvelyn Gardens (Single) 33.50 37.17\n(Double) 24.50 27.68\n* Student Residence Committee.\nAll figures are subject to approval by the Rector.\na \u00a375,000 refurbishment of Warden\nand Sub-Warden accommodation,\nwhich Mr Baker says 'really stinks.'\nThe SRC found that the expenditure\nwas a 'one-off. Managing Surveyor\nof Residences, Peter Hallworth said\nthat a decision had been made that\n'Wardens' accommodation should\nbe standardised.' He added that\nthere are no further plans for\nrefurbishing Warden or Sub-warden\nflats.\nCollege Secretary's solutions to rents?\nCollege Secretary, John Smith is to\ntake a paper on possible solutions\nto the accommodation problem at IC\nto the College's Finance and\nExecutive Committee meeting next\nFriday. The paper proposes the\npossible sale of one of the College's Halls, the transfer of funds from\nacademic accounts to the residence\naccount and the charging of a 'notional rent' for Wardens.\nIn the paper, Mr Smith points out\nstudents' financial difficulties and\nthe high cost of accommodation at\nImperial. On the subject of a transfer\nof funds from academic\ndepartments, Mr Smith argues that\nmoney paid in fees to the College\nabove the minimum amount per\nstudent could be transferred into the\nresidence account. He also suggests\nthat some part of the money\nbrought in by foreign students could\nbe taken from their departments to\nhelp in the funding of residences.\nThis proposal is similar to the one\nput forward by the last Union\nGeneral Meeting.\nIn the document Mr Smith\nacknowledges the concern\ndisplayed by Imperial College Union\nin its motion on rent levels. He\nexpresses concern, however, that\nthe idea of using money from\noverseas students' fees may meet\nwith opposition under the Race\nRelations Act, and adds that\noverseas students are no longer\nguaranteed places in hall. How can\nIC justify a surcharge on such\nstudents for residences they may\nnot use, he queries?\nThe suggestion of selling a Hall is\nnot a new one. The Student\nResidence Committee has been\nconsidering the sale of Montpelier\nHall, in Knightsbridge for some\ntime. The postgraduate hall is\nestimated to be worth \u00a3 4 million.\nThe subject of its proposed\nrefurbishment is still under\ndiscussion. Mr Malcolm Aldridge,\nCollege Senior Assistant Finance\nOfficer told FELIX that no firm\ndecision has been made on the\n\u00a3230,000 refurbishment since there\nare fears that the money will have\nbeen wasted in the event of a sale.\nMaths\nroom\nThe IC Physics Department is\nsuffering from timetabling problems\nafter a doubling in intake levels in\n\u2022the Mathematics Department. First\nyear Maths lectures are being held\nin the Huxley Building, Room 213,\na lecture hall previously used by the\nPhysics Department. When asked\nabout problems caused by this\nchange, Dr Gareth Jones, Head of\nUndergraduate Studies for Physics,\nsaid that the resulting Physics\ntimetable was 'inflexible' and that it\nwas a 'disadvantage'. Speaking on\nthe subject of room 213 in Huxley,\nDr Berkshire of the Maths\nDepartment said, 'it's ours and we\nwill use it as we see fit'.\nSince leaving members of staff\nhave not been replaced under\npresent College policy, staffing\nlevels in the Maths Department\nhave dropped from 60 to 50 in the\npast year. Many tutors have been\nsurprised to find they have 2 or 3\npersonal tu tees instead of the\nprevious 1 or 2. Commenting on the\nlow staffing levels, Dr Berkshire said\n'Well, they'll just have to work\nharder then, won't they?'. He also\nadded that 'it would have been nicer\nif there'd been more' in this year's Maths intake.\nBEST!\nTwo Chemical Engineering students\nrepresented Imperial College at a conference of European science\nstudents in Eindhoven, Holland last\nweek.\nThe conference was held by the\nBoard of European Students in\nScience and Technology (BEST) at\nthe Technische Universiteit of\nEindhoven. BEST was inaugurated\nat a similar conference in Grenoble\nin March of this year and plans to\nhold events in 1989 in Vienna and\nBerlin.\nStudents attended from the EEC,\nScandinavia and the Eastern Block\ncountries of Poland and Hungary.\nThe purpose was to expose differing\ncultures and develop\ncommunication across national\nboundaries.

    "content": "Opinion\nThe\nArms\nRace\nNow is the time when most final\nyear students are beginning to\nthink seriously about finding a job.\nThe Careers Fair is one way in\nwhich companies try to attract the\nattention of future graduates, and\nit is only part of a process of\npresentations designed to smooth\nthe transition from student to\nemployee. But amidst all the\nbrochures and the hype, there are\none or two awkward questions that\nmany companies would prefer not\nto be asked. For the science,\ntechnology and engineering\ngraduates of IC, one of the most\nimportant questions is 'how is your\ncompany in vo loved in the arms\ntrade?'\nThe arms business has not led to\na secure peace, as some hard facts\ncan show. Since 1945, 21 million\npeople have died in wars, mainly in\nthe Third World. Three out of every\nfive deaths were civilians, the\nmajority of them women, children\nand the elderly. Two-fifths of the\nNicamguian Soviet-built HIND helicopter\nworld scientific R&D is devoted to\nmilitary purposes, and $17 billion is\nspent on arms every two weeks (this\namount is enough to feed, clothe\nand house everyone in the world for\na year). The science graduate is an\nintegral part of this process and\nthree out of every five in this\ncountry go on to take a job in arms\nrelated industry. Britain is one of the\nworld's leading arms exporters and\nsold \u00a35,000 million of military\nequipment to overseas countries in\n1986.\nThree-quarters of these UK arms\nexports were to Third World\ncountries. When people in this\ncountry think about the arms trade,\nit is more often in terms of balance\nof payments than about where the\narms go or the uses to which they\nare put. Already nearly every Third\nWorld country spends more on its\nmilitary than on health and\neducation, and many of these\ncountries have serious debts which\nare made worse by the spending on\narmaments. A recent report in a At an opening debate of the UN\nGeneral Assembly in 1987, a number of Third World delegates\nwarned that the debt problems of\ndeveloping nations were as serious\na threat to international stability as\nthe arms race. \"A world in which\npolitics is replaced by arsenals and\neconomy by finance is simply a world in danger,\" stated President\nAlfonsin of Argentina. However, a world in even greater danger is one\nin which the build up of arms is\nactually inter meshed with the debt\ncrisis.\nThird World governments have\nspent a large proportion of loans on\npurchasing expensive weapons\nsystems, greatly encouraged by the\nworld's arms companies who faced\na slump in sales at the end of the\nVietnam war. Between 1972 and\n1982, precisely the period of\nincreased Third World borrowing\nwhich has led to the current global\nfinancial crisis, the value of arms\ndelivered to non-oil producing\ndeveloping countries more than\ndoubled in real terms. Since arms\ncan only be used for destruction,\nthey generate no further income and\nhave done nothing to repay debts.\nIndeed, arms purchases have led to\nfurther borrowing.\nThe Poverty-Repression-Militarisation Cycle\npurchase of arms and luxuries\n7\n<\nlack of foreign exchange\nrepression, concentration of\npower and wealth in the\nhands of the elite\nrevolt; political opposition\nTurning to the International\nMonetary Fund for short term loans,\nThird World governments find that\nloan conditions include a removal of\ngovernment food subsidies, cuts in\nhealth and education, and\nreductions in wages - all measures\nthat extract money from the poorest\nsectors of society. A reduction in\nmilitary spending is never included\nin these conditions.\nSuch austerity measures, by\ndiverting resources into the\ninternational loans; policies\nfor increasing exports\nless food production for local\nconsumption and\nimpoverishment of the society\npurchase of costly military\nequipment, deny people of the most\nfundamental human rights - the\nright to work, to be free from\nhunger and to enjoy good health\nand education. When the denial of\nthese human rights provokes the\npeople into protest, their\ngovernments often find it necessary\nto retaliate with violence, involving\nharsher repression, more military\nspending and greater poverty for\nthe people. A vicious circle is set up\nwhich is extremely difficult to break.\nBritish medical journal on the health\nof the Third World showed a direct\ncorrelation between high arms\nspending and high infant mortality.\nMore directly, this global trade\noccurs in a world where two-thirds\nof the people are undernourished\nand millions are dying from hunger\nand preventable diseases. The arms\ntrade diverts money away from\nthese issues. So without ever being\nused, merely by existing, the ever\nexpanding armour ies of the\nunderdeveloped nations are killing\nand maiming on a massive scale.\nLooking more closely at the\nconsequences of the arms trade\nwithin such countries reveals a vicious dynamic called the poverty-repression-militar is ation cycle. The\ndebt, which is increased by the\nspending on arms and luxuries by\nThird World elites, leads them to\ngenerate more hard currency by\ncutting wages, food subsidies and\nwelfare programmes and by\nincreasing exports (eg. cash crops).\nThe poor, as ever, bear the brunt of\nthese measures but any expression\nof discontent or protest is repressed\nby the government, which then\nbuys more arms to maintain its\nmilitary stranglehold on power.\nThe arms trade is also an overtly\nGreen issue. From the total\ndestruction of full scale war through\nVietnam style defoliation to the\ndeliberate disruption of\nenvironmental programmes by the\nContras in Nicaragua, the business\nof military sales helps to wreck our\nplanet. The militar is ation of the\nworld is the very opposite of a sustainable lifestyle.\nToday, Britain is one of the\nleading arms manufacturers and\ntraders. What about all the jobs that\nmust depend on the arms industry?\nSurely making arms for export\nmakes economic sense? In fact,\nNovember 11 1988 FELIX Page 19\n\n"

    "content": "Loans by 1990\nSpeaking in Parliament on\nWednesday, Kenneth Baker\nannounced that the Government\nhas plans to introduce student loans\nin October 1990.\nHis proposals, published in a white paper entitled 'Top-up Loans\nfor Students', state that loans will\nbe introduced to supplement the\ngrant which will be frozen at the\n1990 level. Grants will remain\nmeans-tested as at present.\nUnder the scheme students will\nno longer be entitled to claim\nhousing or unemployment benefits.\nThe loans will be interest free but\nrepayment will be linked to inflation\nand initially cost an additional\n\u00a3120m. Students graduating on low\nsalaries can have the loan\nrepayment deferred .\nThe proposal allows a student\nliving in London to borrow \u00a3460 per\nyear, and \u00a3340 in their final year .\nThe scheme is designed to\neventually save \u00a3 2 0 0 m per year,\nwhich would be used to make more\nplaces available and according to\nKenneth Baker 'reduce the burden\non parents and taxpayers'. He\nadded that he believed it would\nmake students more self-reliant and\nfinancially independent and would\nbe 'a step away from the\ndependency culture'.\nJack Straw, the labour Shadow\nEducation Secretary, retorted, 'In\nthe future knowledge will be\n3000\n2500H1989/901990/91 Levels of grant, contribution and loan.\n2 0 0 7 / 8\nmortgaged' and added that it would\nreduce access and increase debt.\nThe white paper has been the\nsubject of much press speculation\nrecently, and was reported in FELIX\ntwo weeks ago when Kenneth Baker\nvisited College.\nThe Government intends to\nestablish three \u00a35 million Access\nFunds to provide discretionary\nbursa ries. The funds will be\nadministered by the Universities,\nPolytechnics and colleges of further\neducation to enable students, to\ncontinue their studies in the face of\n'real financial difficulties'. The\nbursa ries will be available to both\nundergraduate and postgraduate\nstudents in addition to the loans.\nHow it will affect the IC student\nThe report bases the requirements\nfor a student's finance on the figures\nshown here.\nThe rent paid by students living\nin private accommodation at \u00a340 per\nweek, over a39 week period, is\n\u00a31560. Currently the difference\nbetween this figure and the rent\nallocation is made up by Housing\nBenefit, about \u00a3400 per year. In\nAugust 1990 this will cease to\nbecome available and poses a grave\nthreat to study in London.\nRentals in London have doubled\nin three years so will very rapidly\nincrease beyond the capacity of the\nloan. If rentals average only \u00a345 per\nweek in 1990 students will find they\nhave a \u00a3600 deficit for each year at\ncollege despite the top-up loan.\nBy Robin Davison.\nBreak-down of a student's expenditure\nfrom top-up loans for students\n\u00a3\nRent 779\nFood 462\nEntertainment 399\nTravel 227\nBooks 172\nClothing 132\nOther 711\nTotal 2882\nNews\nAnswering\nthe critics\nCriticism of the loan system has\nbeen in the form of five main points\nwhich Mr Baker's white paper\nattempts to answer.\nThe Government believes the debt\nburden will not discourage\neducational participation by\ndisadvantaged groups, women and\nmature students. It claims this is an\n'unproved cultural assumption' and\nthat the lower social classes are\nincreasingly dependent on credit.\nCareer prospects and the\nnecessity to earn higher graduate\nsalaries has been a contention of the\nloans issue. The opposition claims\nthese factors will guide students'\nsubject choice. The white paper\nargues that students should be free\nto choose, whilst 'preference needs\nto be informed by a better\nunderstanding of the employment\nmarket'. This is 'in the interest of\nthe student and the economy' it\nadds.\nMr Baker believes academic\nexcellence will not be undermined\nby students taking part-time work.\nHe argues that the academic\nperformance of students is already\ncontrolled by their standard of\nliving.\nThe inflationary pressure of\nforcing graduate salaries higher, is\ndismissed in the report as being\nrelatively small.\nThe issue of default on repayment\nof loans is addressed in the paper.\nIn the USA, where a much more\nadvanced system is present, loan\ndefaults cost $1.6 billion a year. The\nsystem in Britain would allow low\nincome graduates to defer\nrepayment. Graduates who left the\ncountry to avoid repaying top-up\nloans would be prosecuted on their\nreturn.\n'loans of money', said Ken\nBaker on his recent IC visit.\nNovember 11 1988 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Careers\nThe employer\n'How do I choose which employer\nto apply to? They all seem much the\nsame. I 'll apply to the seven largest,\nmost famous; employers with the\nmost vacancies and that will\nprobably do.'\nIt might work but, if you have\nspent any time at all choosing what\noccupation you wish to follow, it\nseems a pity to mess up your future\nhappiness by failing to carry out\nof environment would you enjoy?\nWhat promotion prospects or\ntraining vu ld suit you best? Do\nyou want a.ery open, friendly style\nof management or would you prefer\na more conservative formal firm?\nWhat other factors are likely to make\nthe difference for you between one\nemployer and another? Then when\nface to face with employers or recent\nj graduates, you can question them\nadequate research on your\nprospective employer. There are five\nDirectories of employers of\ngraduates, Register of Graduate\nEmployment and Training (RoGET);\nGraduate Employment and Training\n(GET); Graduate Opportunities (GO);\nDirectory of Opportunities for\nGraduates (DOG) and Directory of\nOpportunities in New Technology\n(DONT). Therse are a good source\nfor your preliminary list of possible\nemployers. Besides outlining the\nvacancies that they may have, they\nmay tell you about the Company's size, its location, its pattern of\nemployment and even a little of its\nphilosophy. Many employers\nproduce special Graduate brochures\nwhich provide profiles of recent\ngraduate entrants of the 'Day in the\nLife of...' variety. There are many\nvideos for those who prefer\nwatching and listening to reading.\nThese can be viewed in the Careers\nVideo Room. Key from Sherfield\nRoom 309. Although all these\nsources will tell you something of\nthe companies, they are produced\nand written by the employers\nthemselves and therefore are\nunlikely to paint the companies in\nanything other than glossy terms.\nThe same can be said of the recent\ngraduates brought along to\ncompany presentations. A company\nis unlikely to bring along people\nwho think it's a foul company in\nwhich to work. So how can you find\nout which company is for you?\nFirstly, you must know what you\nwant from an employer. What sort\nclosely. The Careers Fair is a good\nj place to start. You might ask them\nwhy they think you should work for\ni them rather than for X and Co\nalthough don't sound too arrogant\nwhen doing so! Another valuable\nway of finding out about different\nemployers is at the old students'\nAssociation Careers evening.\nOnce you have narrowed the field\nof employers, you can save\neveryone an awful lot of time by\nchecking whether the companies\nactually have vacancies in the areas\nof which you are applying. Every\nyear, a well known computing\ncompany is inundated with\napplications for computer\nprogramming jobs. They do have\nbetween 400 and 500 vacancies but\nnot for computer programmers.\nIf the company is visiting the\ncampus during the Graduate\nRecruitment Programme then you\ncan obtain the application forms\nfrom the Careers library otherwise\nyou will have to apply directly to the\ncompany.\nAnd finally, think about 'falling\nback positions'. Please consider the\nwisdom of only applying it to the\nbig glamourous, well known\ncompanies. Every year on the\nImperial Graduate Recruitment\nProgramme, perfectly respectable\ncompanies have to cancel their visits\nthrough lack of applications. Just\nthink what it would do to your\nchances of success if you applied to\nsuch a company.\nApplications\nBooks have been written on this\ntopic and so it is not particularly\neasy to condense into a couple of\nhundred words or so.\nA good application is absolutely\ncrucial in seeking any job\u2014without\nit, you have no chance of an\ninterview, let alone the job! The\nreasons why most applications fail\nare because they are badly\npresented (illegible writing, coffee\nstains, etc), badly thought out and\npoorly expressed. One employer\nreported he had rejected 90% on\nthose grounds. Perhaps more\ntypically an employer with about 15\njobs might receive 700 applications\nand these would be reduced to\nabout 150 for the first interview.\nThus it really is significant to get the\ninterview.\nWhat then is the 'secret'? Actually\nthere is no secret at all; just plain\ncommon sense. So here then are a few tips.\n1. Think carefully about what kind\nof job you want, identify possible\nemployers then read up about them\nand their vacancies.\n2. Follow the instructions on the\nform carefully. If they say 'attach a photograph and write in black ink'\nthen you cannot expect too much if\nyou do not send a photo and write\nin blue ink (as a depressing number\nof applicants did for one employer\nlast year).\n3. Work out in advance your\nanswers to the questions on the\nform.\n4. Draft and edit your answers to fit\nthe space provided.\n5. Answer all the questions. If one\nis not really applicable to you,\nexplain why that is so and do not\nleave the space blank.\n6. Keep it all simple; keep a copy.\n7. Try and view your application\nfrom the employers position. Would\nyou be impressed by the answers?\nIt is not likely that you would be if\nthere were broad unsupported\ngeneralisations, for example; T can\ncommunicate well and get on with\npeople'\u2014is the evidence elsewhere\non the form?\n8. If you want more help or advice\nsee one of the Careers Advisers. If\nalso after a few applications you\nhaven't been invited to an\ninterview, come and see us again.\nInterviews\n'The unspoken message'\u2014When\ncalled to an interview, the unspoken\nmessage from the employer is that\nthey like the look of you on paper\nand so wish to meet you to confirm\nthat view. The invitation to the\nsecond interview is, that having\nchecked you out, 'we'd now like to\ngive you the proper interview from\nwhich we may make you an offer'.\nThus, the first interview, often\nheld in College and certainly for\nthose employers listed in the GRP\nProgramme, is relatively short.\nMuch will consist of points in you\napplication\u2014'tell me more about\nthat', 'why did you do that?',\n'describe your project'. In some\ncases there may be a little technical\ncontent. The interview is also a chance for you to ask questions\u2014\nso have some prepared! In fact be\nprepared all round\u2014dress suitably,\narrive in good time, be friendly and\npositive, look at your interviewer,\nbe prepared to smile, be honest\u2014if\nyou don't know the answer to a question, say so and don't waffle!\nThe second interview is normally\non the employers premises. This\ngives a special chance for you to\nevaluate the employer (after all it is\na two way process)\u2014does the place\nseem a good one in which to work?\nAre the employers friendly? How\nare recent graduates getting on? The\nemployers may have a variety of\ntests for you to do\u2014some use\npsycho metric tests, some use group\ndiscussions\u2014here the important\nthing is not so much whether you\nget the right answers to the problem\nbut how you deal with other people,\nhow do you react under stress.\nFinally, there will be the interview\nitself, very often before a board. Of\ncourse you will be nervous but the\nconfidence that comes from a good\npreparation can help a lot.\nOnce again the Careers Service\ncan be part of that preparation. We\nare easy to find, easy to consult and\nwe are running a comprehensive\nprogramme of talks and seminars,\nwe also have a lot of literature, so\nif you want any help, do come and\nsee us.\nPage 12 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Sports\nNETBALL\nGood start\nIC 1-50\nLSP-11\nLast Saturday morning an\nexceptionally bleary eyed netball\nteam assembled at South\nKensington station for the first ULU\nmatch of the season. The team\ntrundled over to Russell Square to\nplay London School of Pharmacy (or\nSOPS as they call themselves) on\ntheir court situated in an 'inner city farm' complete with sheep!\nWe looked very scruffy next to\nsmartly kit ted LSP in our odd\nassortment of track suits, skirts and\ntops (lack of funds for kit from IC\nUnion) but fortunately the netball\nwas better than our strip. Lunchtime\npractices have certainly paid off. The\nteam played well together and for\nonce on LSP's court un hampered by\nsheep. By half-time IC had\nestablished a clear lead and went on\nto win without seriously maiming\nthe LSP team.\nFOOTBALL\nTop of the\nTable\nIC II\u20146\nUC II\u20141\nWith IC top of the table, and UC\nsecond, this looked as if it would be\nIC's toughest game yet, and my\nword it was! UC kicked off, and for\nten minutes press uri sed the IC\ndefence. But with the class and\ncoolness of Russ Dark and Jezz\nHolland in the heart of the defence,\ngoalkeeper Webster Nonde was\nnever bothered. Then came the\nbreakthrough. Good work on the\nright from Ash Jalan allowed the\ncross, and Rackesh Muthoo was\nthere to poke the ball home. The\nsecond, ten minutes later was\ncreated in a similar fashion, with\nGuy Phiri scoring from an awkward\nheader. IC went forward again, and\njust before half-time, and Ed Coates\ncorner was cleverly dum mie d by\nRuss Dark to leave debut ant Kev\nGraves the easiest of chances to\nmake it 3-0. After the switch, UC\npress uri sed again, but it was IC who\nscored through Adam Thomas, on\nthe break. Adam then added a fifth\nas IC began to play some lovely\nfootball. UC then scored, but it was\nIC who had the last laugh. Freddie\nDadze wriggled his way through the\nUC defence, and then calmly placed\nthe ball under the keeper. After this\ndemolition of one of the strongest\nteams in division 1, IC II look to be\nin for another successful season.\nTHE SPORTS PAGE\nFOOTBALL\nDoug King\nAndy Watson finds trouble in their 30-6 win at LSE\nORIENTEERING\nNovember\nClassic\nThe morning after Guy Fawkes\nNight was incredibly foggy, as if all\nthe bonfire smoke had failed to\ndisperse, and the sight made me\nwonder if it was worth getting out\nof bed. Alright so oriente ers are only\nsupposed to need a map and\ncompass, but there are limits! I made the rendezvous with a nice\ncomfy van which whisked us off to\nthe New Forest.\nBy the time we arrived the day\nhad metamorphosed into a bright,\nsunny and warm ish sort of day and,\npausing only to don our 'O' suits,\nwe set off , one by one to run\nthrough the beautiful woodland.\nFor those who think they\nunderstand orienteering, but don't, it consists of getting from certain\npoints in the countryside to certain\nother ones, preferably in a suggested order and fairly rapidly.\nThe most amusing feature of this\ntrip was the unusual presence of\ncamouflaged 'watchers', behind\ntrees and in hides who became very\nsecretive when asked what on Earth\nthey were doing. One theory is that\ntheir mastermind (Dr Spellenberg of\nSouthampton University) was\nres era ching the 'environmental\nimpact of orienteering'.\nWell, my old expedition injury\n(acquired in the Karakoram you\nknow) played up, so my\nperformance was a little below best\n(so I'm told) but what do you care\nanyway?\nThe sport is truly open to all and\nthe club will cater r for absolutely\nanyone (although two legs and the\nability to run 100 yards at the finish\nare a basic requirement). If you are\nmildly interested, call internal 6776\nfor Andrew Fazakerley (club\ncaptain).\nRUGBY\nUnbeaten\nAfter a particularly good intake\nduring Freshers' Fair, Imperial\nCollege rugby is still unbeaten. The\nClub is putting out two teams every\nWednesday and Saturday which are\nnearly the same standard.\nIC 1st XV's most pleasing victory\nwill most probably be against the\nformerly unbeaten club side,\nOrlcons FP. This performance\nshowed a lot of determination,\nespecially among the forwards, who\nfinally secured us a place in the 3rd round of the Middlesex Cup.\nAfter our first UAU game against\nSussex, we were to play LSE last\nWednesday. Due to lack of\nconcentration IC were only 8-6 up\nat half time. During half time\neveryone got a kick up the bum\nfrom the captain, S Blanco, and IC\njumped into a higher gear pinning\nLSE in their 22 for the rest of the\nmatch.\nA powerful drive from the\nforwards was finished off by a try\nfrom H Fadge. Three tries followed\nfrom Hughes, Anderson and\nWatson which brought the final\nscore to 30-6.\nDivision 6\nIC VI-1\nLSE V \u20143\nTodd Hansen's first goal of the\nseason, a30 yard drive that left the\nkeeper clutching thin air, was not\nenough as IC dropped some\nvaluable points in their bid for\npromotion. Playing yet again with\nonly 10 men, IC were unlucky not\nto get a draw with Albert Wong\nbeing denied by the crossbar and a fine save by the keeper.\nMENS HOCKEY Demolition\nIC 2nds8 LSE0 Although some warned of\ncom pace n cy the 2nd XI went into\ntheir second UAU game with high\nhopes after a resounding 4-1\nthrashing of Sussex. Our worst fears\nwere realised when we learned our\ngoalkeeper had opted for a lie-in.\nHowever, our forwards produced\nthe goods against an opposition\nfeared throughout the land.\nThe second half saw the demise\nof your faithful correspondent, as a fatal head injury forced him off the\nfield with concussion leaving the\nremainder of the game shrouded in\nmystery. The result, however, was\nnever in question.\nBADMINTON UAU Success\nAs usual before the badminton\nseason has really got going we have\nbeen thrown in at the deep end with\nsome tough UAU matches. Last\nweek we travelled down to Sussex\nUniversity where, despite having\ntrouble with the drift on court and\nthe confusing array of coloured lines\non the floor our mens teams\ntriumphed 8-1 (mens I) and 5-4\n(mens II).\nUnfortunately the ladies were\ndefeated 9-0 by a Sussex team that\ndidn't really contain any players of\nspectacular ability. The main\nproblem was that we were playing\nwith totally new partners and\nconfusion in positioning caused\nmany points to be lost. This is\nsupported by the fact that the scores\nimproved steadily as the afternoon\nwent on.\nPage 24 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Careers\nThoughts on finding a care e What do you think is important? Have you decided yet? Do you care?\nIf you think the third statement applies to you, then I'm not sure what\nyou are doin\u00a3 at Imperial College in the first place!\nMy qualifications for writing this do not include becoming the chairman\nof the company I work for\u2014yet!...However, three years after leaving\nUniversity I'm happy that I 've made the right decisions so far. My work\nhas been interesting and enjoyable and my salary quite acceptable!\nThroughout my time at University\nmy ideas on careers were constantly\nevolving and I hope they will\ncontinue to evolve for a few years\nyet! So far they seem to have\nworked out well for me and\ntherefore I 'll try and explain a few\nfactors that I believe are important.\nFirst of all, it helps to have the\nconfidence that you'll be able to do\nand obtain the job that you want; in\nIt is difficult to\npersuade someone\nelse you can do a job\nwhen you're not sure\nyourself.\nthat order\u2014there's no point in\nseriously applying for a job unless\nyou reckon you've got a chance at\npersuading the employer that you\nare capable of that job and it's difficult to persuade someone else\nthat you can do a job when you're\nnot sure yourself. I'm not talking\nabout 'bullshitting' (it tends to get\nspotted!), but straight confidence in\nyour own abilities. On the other\nhand, there isn't any harm in\napplying for a couple of jobs for\npractice; but don't be surprised if\nyou don't get offered them\u2014it often\nshows when you are not interested.\nIt helps if you can\nfind something that\nyou enjoy.\nAnother important aspect is, of\ncourse, deciding what you want to\ndo. Since most of your waking life\nis spent at work, (unless you are an\ninsomniac or thinking of a part-time\ncareer), it helps if you can find\nsomething that you enjoy. Some\npeople may believe in saving up all\ntheir happy moments for the annual\nholiday, but not me\u2014I want to enjoy\nlife all year round, not just for two\nor three weeks in the summer. I find\nthat I can be paid very adequately\nfor work which I find rewarding,\nand can then afford to spend my\nholidays in the many different ways\nthat I enjoy. By the way, it might be\nworth checking how much holiday\nyour prospective employer does\nallow.\nI found that it was very difficult,\nfrom an interview, to discover what\nwas on offer\u2014most of the time was\nspent discussing my capabilities.\nTherefore, it was essential to visit\nthe company and have a chance to\nchat to the people working there.\nThis is the only way you can get a feel for the environment where you\nmight spend your next couple of\nyears. Peoples' attitudes to their\nwork were important; but even\nmore important, was whether I felt\nI could work with them. You always\ntend to work as part of a team and\nso it helps if you can respect the\nwanting work to provide a large\nproportion of your ongoing\nchallenges. I looked for a company\nthat would continue to present me\nwith chall eng. es and new\nopportunities throughout my\ncareer. So, for me, it was important\nthat the company I joined believed\nin career development and hence in\ndeveloping my career with me. That\nway I have the widest opportunities:\nI still have the option to leave if I don't like the way things are going,\nbut I have the advantage that the\ncompany itself has an interest in\nhelping me to progress towards\nmore senior jobs.\nContinued training and personal\ndevelopment throughout your\ncareer are very important\u2014job\nexperience, though vitally\nimportant, needs back-up away\nfrom the job\u2014to clarify your ideas\nand teach you new ways of tackling\nproblems. Technical training leading\nto membership of a Professional\nInstitution is very useful, especially\nif you wish to work abroad at some\npeople you work with. A company's policy to its employees can be read\nin its annual report but how that\npolicy works in practice can only be\nascertained by talking to the people\nwho work for that company. On the\nsubject of annual reports\u2014it is often\nworth checking that the company\nwill be able to afford to pay your\nsalary for the first couple of years'\n(and even some profit sharing too!).\nWork can be very challenging\nwherever you are for the first couple\nof months\u2014getting to know\npeople's names, getting into work\nevery morning on time, finding\nsomewhere to live...however, once\nyou've got the rest of your life\nsorted out then you'll probably be-point in your career. Though you\ncan obtain training individually, it's much easier if your company is\ncommitted to it. You can then make\nuse of established training packages\nand tailor them to your own needs.\nLocation is largely dependent on\npersonal taste. A factor also to be\ntaken into account is how often the\nlocation changed! I personally had\nno strong feelings on these matters\nwhen I left University\u2014but it does\nhave a very large impact on your\nlifestyle and quality of life. Though\ntravel often seems exciting, most\npeople seem to tire of it after a while\u2014so check you have an option\nto change in case you change your\nmind! The advantages often seem to\ninvolve increased monetary reward\nbut there tends to be reasons why\nthe companies have to pay these\nsums. The expatriate lifestyle may\nalso be attractive\u2014though it is fast\ndisappearing in most countries. I was brought up with this style of\nliving and so fortunately had a chance to see all its facets; so though\nI enjoyed myself greatly living\nabroad I had no great urge to spend\nall my life there!\nWithin this country there is great\nvariety. Remember the North? Well\nI have moved up here and have\nfound many advantages. At\nUniversity I chose the job and\ncompany, rather than the location\nwhich I wanted to work in..\nHowever, when I compare myself\nto many friends who stayed on in\nLondon, I find I am able to afford\na wider choice of how and where I wish to live. A recent report\nsuggested that you have to earn\n\u00a337,000 in London to achieve a similar standard of living to\nsomeone on \u00a320,000 in the North;\nand don't worry there are plenty of\nways of spending it up here.\nEnjoy the hunt!\nAnother choice you might have to\nconsider is between industry and\ncommerce. Many people think that;\nthe bright lights of London are more;\nattractive, however, I chose,\nengineering in Industry and, as I have already said, I am happy with\nthat decision.\nFinally, I don't suppose I should\nfinish without mentioning starting\nsalaries. They are generally\nindicative of the quality of person\nthat the company is seeking to\nemploy; but only between similar\ntypes of companies. Of equal\nimportance though is progression of\nyour salary once starting work.\nWatch out for high ish salaries that\ndon't lead anywhere\u2014there is often\nlimited scope and some companies\noperate a 'burn them out' and\n'chuck them out' policy. If you are\nonly after the money then I'm sure\nyo can find it for a couple of years\u2014\nthe problem is how to sustain that\nincome and then increase it.\nI 've mentioned a few of the areas\nthat I thought through before\nchoosing a job\u2014there are many\nmore; but I hope I 've stirred up\nsome of the issues that you will have\nto consider in the next couple of\nmonths. Enjoy the hunt...!\nCaroline Scott, Electrical Engineer.\nPage 14 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nWhoops\n/Dear Bill,\nI write to apologise for the confusion that seems\nto have arisen over SCABNITE this year. In last\nFriday's FELIX it was advertised with an incorrect\nstarting time and subscription. SCABNITE will\ntake place on Saturday 12th November in the\nUnion Concert Hall commence ing at 7.30pm. The\nsubscription will be \u00a32.50 at the door.\nThis year's performances are as varied as ever\nwith all the SCAB societies represented \u2014\nOP SOC, CHOIR, CHAMBER MUSIC,\nDRAMSOC, FILMSOC and JAZZ & ROCK\nCLUB. The program includes Stoppard's'15 minute Hamlet' and a showing of 'Dead Men\nDon't Wear Plaid' with Steve Martin.\nI hope to see lots of FELIX readers enjoying\nwhat is always an entertaining evening.\nHave a happy Rag Week.\nRoger Davies,\nSCAB Chairman.\nUGM\nChair\nDear Bill,\nI have always been a believer that you can write\nanything you like about me so long as views and\nopinions go under an 'Editorial' or 'Opinion'\nheading. In this way the readers will realise that\nthis is your opinion and not a factual report, and\ncan then make their own minds up as to whether\nthey agree with it or not. I do however believe\nthat if you are going to base your editorials on\nfact then you should at least get the facts right.\nIn your editorial, printed in issue 816, you go\non to discuss the position of the U GM chairman.\nThe whole of the section revolves around the Blue\nBook, the book that contains the Union\nConstitutions and By-laws. When I questioned\nwhether you had looked at the Blue Book before\nwriting your editorial I was not surprised to hear\nthat you hadn't. Why wasn'tI surprised? Because\nthe facts that you base the whole piece on are\ntotally incorrect.\nThe whole saga started when the person\nelected to be the U GM Chairman, Paul Shanley,\nfailed his exams. Paul then decided to enroll as\na part-time student so that he would still be\neligible to undertake the role of U GM Chairman.\nWhen this was brought to my attention I consulted the Blue Book to see what the position\nwas. If Paul had registered as a part-time student\nthen he would have been an Associate Member\nof IC Union. According to the Union by-laws,\n'Associate members shall have the same rights\nas full members except for the right to represent\nImperial College in any team.' I then read what\nrights full members have and the last line read,\n'only full members of the Union may hold elected\nUnion posts representing students.' This was\nquite clearly a contradiction in the by-laws. On\none hand Paul was entitled to be U GM Chairman\nand on the other he wasn't. No where in the by-.\nlaws does it say who was responsible for the.\ninterpretation of such by-laws. A decision had to\nbe made as to who was to make the necessary\ninterpretation.\nThe date was now the middle of September and\nas the Fresher'sU GM was planned for the first\nThursday of term, I realised that the matter was\nquite urgent. I again consulted the Blue Book for\nthe terms of reference for the Executive\nCommittee. These state 'it shall concern itself\nwith domestic matters and matters of urgency.'\nSo, in my capacity as President, I called an Exec\nmeeting to discuss the matter. When the Exec\nmet, on 22nd September, there were five\nmembers present, not four as mentioned in you\neditorial, another factual mistake. Quorum for\nExec is four and I thought that considering it was\nsummer vacation, five out of six members was\nnot a bad achievement. At the meeting we\ndiscussed that Paul was unable to take up his\nposition. This was a unanimous decision.\nIn light of the above explanation I'm sure you\nwill realise that your statements; 'four of the\nUnion Executive decided that the Blue Book was\nincorrect and that Mr Shanley was unable to take\nup his post,' and 'the executive had no right to\nmake such a decision' are totally wrong. The last\nstatement in that section of the editorial was, 'the\nUnion President does not have the power to\nreinterpret the Blue Book as he sees fit,' which\nitself is quite correct, however, in the context of\nthe rest of the piece it implies that I did reinterpret\nthe Blue Book as I saw fit, something which I have\nshown not to be true. I therefore hope that you\nhave the strength of character to admit that you\nwere wrong and print an apology. Next time you\nwant to have a go at me, please get the facts right.\nNigel D Baker,\nICU President.\nFisher\nagain\nDear Editor,\nAs the newly elected committee of Fisher Hall\nwe would like to inform your readers on the state\nof affairs in our Hall and to take a view on the\nissues discussed in the two letters which\nappeared in the 28/10/88 issue of FELIX.\nFisher Hall is the newest Hall of Imperial\nCollege and is a pleasant place to live, situated\nin an excellent area, with new furniture and\ndecorating, well-equipped common areas and\nmany active and friendly people who have helped\nmake several events a success since the beginning\nof term\nA lot of work is needed during the first term\nof full operation to establish procedures and\nmaximise the use of space and resources for the\nbenefit of the residents. It would be an\noversimplification to assume that our Hall could\nsimply copy the procedures of another Hall. One\nreason is that Fisher Hall is not situated within\nthe main complex of Halls near the College. This\nmeans that we cannot have a messenger or\nsecurity guard, for example, at a reasonable cost.\nOur sub wardens have been coping with the\nadditional burden responsibly and systematically\nand have shown considerable enthusiasm and\nability in dealing with their normal duties as well\nas special events. They have the full confidence\nof the committee and all the members believe that\nthe views expressed in the anonymous letter do\nno represent the views of the majority of the\nresidents.\nOn the specific subject of mail distribution, new\nways are being considered and we will hopefully\nhave a better procedure soon.\nOur committee election was not particularly\nlate\u2014it has in fact taken place earlier than similar\nelections in several other Halls or Houses.\nWe feel that the intention of the authors of the\nletters in question was to point out weaknesses\nand to be constructive on the issues mentioned\nthere. However, it is fair to say that there has\nbeen an element of exaggeration (extreme in the\nfirst letter) combined with a level of apprehension\nwhich is not normally expected in the first two\nor three weeks after moving in.\nThe committee is determined to see that a very\nhappy, social atmosphere dominates and is\nbacked by many other residents with lots of ideas\nand the will to make things happen. It encourages\nand welcomes the participation of all the\nresidents, including the authors of the a fore mentioned letters. We are delighted to add that\nwe have already obtained a list of\nrecommendations from the authors of the second\nletter, which confirms a constructive attitude on\ntheir part, and we invite them to become more\ninvolved.\nYours sincerely,\nTheodore Theodoropoulos,\nHall Convener on behalf of the Committee of Fisher\nHall.\nWar\nDear Bill,\nI refer to the letter from IC Class War Group\n(FELIX, Nov 4). According to the members of that\ngroup Mrs Gross was 'murdered' by the police-in fact she died of a heart attack. PC Blakelock,\non the other hand, was 'killed during a riot'.\nMay I suggest that Class War have mixed up\nthe definitions of 'to kill' and 'to murder'. I doubt\nit, the real reason is that PC Blakelock was part\nof the 'oppressive' class and Mrs Gross was part\nof the 'oppressed' class.\nYours faithfully,\nSD Cholerton.\nPhones\nDear Bill,\nI am writing to express my dissatisfaction with\nthe College switchboard and its operators. On\nnumerous occasions I have tried phoning either\nfrom externally or internally (to request a phone\nnumber), in the middle of the day, and have\nreceived no reply, despite ringing for 2 or 3\nminutes. Even so the telephone is rarely\nanswered in less than ten rings.\nThese people are paid to answer the telephones\nand they should do so! It must reflect very badly\non IC when outsiders ring in and the telephone\nis not answered immediately.\nYours Irritatedly,\nLiz Warren.\nPage 4 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Careers\nIn Summary...\nGeneral Employment Prospects\nSince the low in 1981/82,\nemployment prospects have been\nrising steadily. Although full\nunemployment rates are one\nobvious indicator of this (and\nImperial is always at or near\nbottom of the league table), ever;\nother measure tells the same story.\nThus there are more jobs on offer,\nmore employers asking to visit,\nmore employers having jobs\navailable at Summer Fairs and many\nothers. While all these signs art\nparticularly evident here, the same\noptimistic reports are being made all\naround the country. As might be\nexpected, demand is strongest in\nsuch areas as electronics and\ncomputer science. One employer,\ncommenting on the trend, reckoned\nthey would have to run hard to\nstand still! In other words they were\ngoing to find it much harder to\nrecruit as many graduates in 1986 as\nthey did in 1985. There has also\nbeen a good recovery in recruitment\nlevels in manufacturing and, to a slightly lesser extent, the oil\nindustry. Finance (Banking,\nAccour' cy, Insurance,\nCommoc, iti , and Retailing are two\nother areas that need a special\nm \u00b0nti on. Most of the employers\ne are making special efforts to\nscience and engineering\ng,^ duat es. All this does not mean that the\n1988 graduates can sit back and wait\nfor attractive job offers. The market\ndoes not operate that way. As an\nexample; about 300 electronics\ngraduates were unemployed at the\nstart of the year. It is still vital to\nremember you must be realistic\u2014if\nyou have taken five years for a pass\ndegree do not insist on looking for\naR&D job as one graduate (from\nelsewhere in London) did a few\nyears ago. Also good applications\nare crucial but they are dealt with\nelsewhere in this issue.\nTaking a Year Off\n...or six months (some employers\nrecruit in March).\nA year off taken before University\nis welcomed almost universally.\nQuite a number think seriously\ninstead about having some time off\nafter graduation and before starting\n(serious!) work. This too can be very\nrewarding and productive. As\nusual, however, there are some\nqualifications to be made. If, for\nexample, you are aged about 21 or\n22 then there is no problem, from\nan age consideration, regarding\nyour eventual career prospects. If,\nhowever, you are 24 or 25 it may be\nless straightforward and it could be\nworthwhile to seek careers advice\nfirst. It is also good that at any age\nyou would have some sort of plan\nfor the year and one which you can\narticulate\u2014perhaps to a future\nemployer. You should be able to talk\nabout what your aims were, what\nyou gained from the experience etc.\nYou should also think ahead. For\nexample it might be fun going\njacka roo ing in Australia for about 12\nmonths but you will hardly be well\nplaced to apply for jobs back in the\nUK. For just such simple reasons as\nthis, 12 months off often becomes 15\nor more. Remember the vacancy\nlists in September are probably\nshorter than at any other time of the\nyear. Nevertheless, given some\nthought and planning, some time\noff after graduation can be fun,\nproductive and, for many, a time of\ngreat personal development.\nSummer Fairs\nIt has always been wrong to think\nof recruitment as being only a January to March phenomenon\nassociated with the Graduate\nRecruitment Programme (GRP),\notherwise known as the Milk\nRound. In fact, recruitment is\nincreasingly becoming an all-the-year-round event. Nevertheless,\noutside the GRP, the next busy peak\nis during the Summer Fairs. This is\nthe time in June and July, starting\nimmediately after finals, when there\nare about ten fairs throughout the\ncountry. Of these, London's is by\nfar the biggest. This year almost 200\nemployers attended during its three\ndays, with a wide variety of jobs on\ni offer. Thus these events are\nI particularly useful for those who\nhave not wanted to think about jobs\ni prior to graduation.\nATTENTION\nall staff and students\nMicro-Facilities Ltd, the first IBM\naccredited education dealer now offer\n40% off all IBM PC computers\nXT 286 with keyboard and mono display (KX0123) 5.25\"\n20 MB HD DOS 3.3\n\u00a3999.00*\nWith EGA Colour Display\n\u00a31349.00*\nCALL US NOW ON 01-943 3922\n*excluding VAT.\nGROUP Micro Facilities ltd.\nCentral House\nHigh St. Hampton Hill\"\nMiddlesex TW12 INS\nTel: 01-943 3922\nNovember 11 1988 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Careers\nTeaching \u2014the\npolitics and pitfalls of the\nclassroom\nThere was a time when teaching\nwas regarded by some as a soft\noption - a last resort for the graduate\nif all else failed. This is no longer the\ncase; the profession faces greater\nchallenges today than at any time in\nits history and graduates would be\nwell advised to consider carefully\nthe evolutionary processes which\nare combining to make teaching one\nof the most stressful occupations\ntoday.\nBefore considering the financial\nrewards, short days and long\nholidays it may be advisable to think\nof the high proportion of teachers\nwho retire early on the grounds of\nill health or mental breakdown.\nWhat is happening in the world\nof education to produce such serious\nproblems? One of the most\ncontentious issues is discipline in\nthe classroom. It is not simply a question of the much publicised\nviolence or the abolition of corporal\npunishment; laudable though it\nwas, it was simply the first step in\na series of legal moves which have\nreduced the sanctions available to\nteachers'to an alarming extent.\nDiscipline in today's classrooms\ncan only be maintained by a process\nof negotiation between the teacher\nand pupil, but not all parents or\npupils are prepared to enter into\nthat process.\nThe status of teachers in todays\nsociety is constantly called into\nquestion. Words such as\naccountability and assessment are\nbandied around with little or no\nunderstanding of the problems they\ncreate. Mr Baker, has stated that\nteachers should be assessed\nannually - a simple enough idea, but\nby whom and on what grounds ?\nThe learning and teaching processes\nare subjective; they cannot be\nquantified or measured empirically.\nThere is also the problem of the\nobjectivity of the proposed\nassessment.\nThe encroachment of information\ntechnology into the classroom is\nanother factor which is claiming a lot\nof firsts for some teachers. The\nrange of skills and knowledge\nrequired to handle the new\ntechnology expands daily and\nteachers are expected to keep\nabreast of these developments.\n'It is without doubt a very rewarding career, if\none is successful, but it is also extremely\ndemanding.'\nThrough the advisory services local\neducation authorities do provide\ncourses to enable teachers to gain\nnew skills or expert ese, but the\nknowledge base is constantly\nshifting and expanding.\nThe stresses involved in these\ndevelopments coupled with\nadditional work of the changing\nsyllabuses and examination\nrequirements have increased the\nwork load of the teacher to an extent\nwhich could not be for seen20 years\nago. As a direct consequence the\nteacher finds himself operating in a strained environment which is\nforeign to the one he envisaged\nwhen he elected to enter the\nprofession.\nThe Government's latest package\nof proposals indicate the rate of\nchange is not going to slacken. The\nadvent of the City Technical\nColleges (CTC) in their areas will\ncreate even greater pressures on the\nteacher. Already schools are\nbeginning to compete with each\nother. There is a per cie ved need to\nbe judged as being a 'good' or\n'successful' school and the obvious\ncriteria for comparison is\nexamination results. If the 'better'\neducated parent of pupils who\ncurrently attend secondary schools';\nwith good catchment areas send\ntheir children to the local CTC the\nschool's success rate in\nexaminations will fall off. Will the\nschool then be judged as a failure?\nThere will certainly be an increase\nin the pressure brought to bear on\nteachers to maintain past levels of\nachievement. As we move into an\nera when schools will be responsible\nfor their own financial\nadministration, and the funding is\ndependent on the number of pupils\nattending each school parental\nchoice will become a vital\nconsideration in the success or\notherwise of any school. The\nprospects for some schools look very\nbleak indeed.\nIn the light of these and other\ndevelopments currently under\nconsideration, it will behold the\ngraduate well to think very carefully\nbefore commiting him or her self to\na career in teaching. It is without\ndoubt a very rewarding career, if\none is successful, but it is also\nextremely demanding. In the old\ndays it was said that 'those who can\ndo - those who can't teach.' Perhaps\nit should be rephrased 'those who\ncan teach and those who can't should keep well away'.\nActuary Most people have absolutely no idea\nwhat an actuary is or does, unless\nthey know one. This is not\nsurprising, as there are only about\n2000 qualified actuaries in Britain.\nActuaries are professional people\nwho have taken exacting\nprofessional examinations. They\nwork mostly in the field of insurance\nand life assurance, where they\ndevise insurance policies and\npension schemes, manage and\ninvest the fund:, generated from\nsuch schemes, or work as\nconsultants or brokers for\ncompanies wishing to invest in\npension schemes.\nTo do their job, actuaries require\na sound knowledge of statistical\ntheory, demography (population\nstatistics), economics and\ninvestment. Most actuaries have a mathematics or economics degree,\nalthough any degree with a strong\nmathematical element may be\nacceptable.\nThere are ten actuarial\nexaminations, divided into two\nsections. The first six examinations\ndeal with the necessary theory. The\nother four examinations deal with\nthe application of this theory to\neveryday actuarial problems. Most\nactuaries study via correspondence\ncourses (although there are some\none year MSc courses, which allow\nexemption from part of the\nexaminations). The majority of large\ninsurance companies allow two half\ndays paid leave each week for study\npurpose. It is usual for actuarial\nstudents to complete their\nexaminations in four to six years,\nwhen they will become Associates\nof the Institute of Actuaries.\nThe Financial rewards for\nactuaries are generous\u2014higher than\nthose for accountants (though\nprobably not as high as, for\nexample, merchant banking). The\naverage graduate salary is\napproximately \u00a310,000 in London,\nrising to \u00a317,000 for newly qualified\nactuaries.\nMost trainee actuaries join large\ninsurance or life assurance\ncompanies. They provide 'on the\njob' training, to complement the\nformal examinations, moving their\ntrainees around their different\ndepartments. It is usual to spend six\nmonths to a year in each section,\nand this not only provides the\nopportunity to apply the theory\nacquired during study, but also to\n'try out' different areas and choose\nthe area one wishes to specialise in.\nGeorgina Warren and\nElizabeth Warren.\nPage 16\nFELIX\nNovember 11 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial Student Loans. The introduction of\nstudent loans, announced on\nWednesday, represents another nail\nin the coffin in which the Robbins\nprinciple of freely available\neducation has been laid to rest.\nThe Government has presented\nthe scheme as an attempt to help\nstudents. In reality it provides the\nGovernment with the excuse it\nneeds to first freeze, than phase out\nstudent grants completely.\nAny move which leads to a reduction in the number, of highly\neducated people in a country can\nonly be detrimental to the country's interest. Alternative Prospectus. The\nCollege, with some hesitation, has\nreleased the mailing list which will\nallow the Union to send out this\nyear's batch of Alternative\nProspectus (AP) supplements. The\nsupplements are likely to cause a few raised eyebrows amongst those\nCollege academics who cannot\nbelieve that the ivory towers in this\ncentre of excellence are anything\nless than sparkling.\nWhilst the AP has always proved\ncontroversial, the reaction of some\nacademics when it comes to criticism\ncan only be described as childish.\nTwo years ago the Alternative\nProspectus Editor, Sunny Bains,\nreceived open threats from one of\nthe lecturers within her department\nbecause the lecturer did not approve\nof her editorial comments. The\nmeeting left Sunny in tears and she\nwas told that she would have to\n'accept the consequences' of her\nactions. What those consequences\nwere was not made clear, but\nwhether they would have affected\nher degree class, references, or any\napplication to take a second degree\nis an open question.\nThis, year, departments were\nunhappy with the first version of the\nAlternative Prospectus Supplement\nedited by Martyn Peck. They were\nquite correct; the supplement was\ninaccurate and later completely\nrewritten.\nNevertheless the paranoia\ngenerated by the AP is illustrated by\na letter circulated by an academic in\nthe Mathematics Department. The\nletter accused Paul Shanley of\nwritting the article on Mathematics\nwhich it described as 'clear libel'.\nThe academic based his\nassumption on the fact that the\nname 'Shan' had appeared in the\ncredits 'for providing endless hours\nof amusement'.\nBut the article was written by\nMartyn Peck.\nwhether or not the incident had\nanything to do with the\ndepartment's refusal to let Mr\nShanley re-sit some of his exams\nwhen he was entitled to do so, is a moot point.\nGiven the attitude of members of\nthe College staff to the Alternative\nProspectus, I do not think the Union\ncan continue to expect individual\nstudents to take on its entire\nproduction. An editorial committee\nseems to have a lot in its favour;\nprotection from victim is ation and a greater input of student views. It is\nsomething that the Union should\nseriously consider.\nApologies. The Union President\nNigel Baker is quite right to point\nout two factual errors in last weeks\neditorial and I would like to take the\nopportunity to set the record\nstraight.\nThe questions raised in the\neditorial revolved around the\nelection of a Chairman for the Union\nGeneral Meetings (UGM's) and the\nfact that the Union Executive had\ndecided that a part-time student,\nPaul Shanley, was not eligible for\nthe post.\nThe rules to determine the validity\nof all elections are contained within\nthe 'Blue Book' - the 'Bible' by\nwhich the Union operates.\nThe particular rules concerning\nthe eligibility of part-time students\nto take up Union posts are not\nclearly defined, and this is where\nthe dispute originates.\nHaving read Nigel's letter there\nare two points I would like to\ncorrect. Firstly, the decision\nconcerning the Blue Book was made\nby 5 members of the IC Union\nExecutive not 4 as stated in the\neditorial. Secondly, and this is a major point, the Executive did not\nover-rule the Blue Book, they\ninterpreted it.\nAs Nigel points out in the letters\npage, to change the by-laws requires\nthe approval of two Union General\nMeetings (UGM) and the Governing\nBody of Imperial College. However\nthe interpretation of the Blue Book\nis arguably a matter for the Union\nExecutive.\nIn this case the Blue Book\ncontained contradictory information\nand the Executive were free to\ninterpret it however they wished.\nI would therefore like to apologise\nto Nigel and the rest of the Executive\nfor suggesting otherwise.\nLoop Holes. Two years ago a precedent was set which allowed\npart-time students to take up posts\nin the Union. The case in point was\nthe election of part time-student,\nSydney Harbour-Bridge (name\nchanged in aid of comic relief) to the\nposition of Union President. The\nExec of the day met and interpreted\nthe Blue Book to allow part-time\nstudents to take up Union positions.\nMr Harbour Bridge was therefore\nPresident for a year, his successor\nbeing Nigel Baker.\nThe fact that this year's Exec were\nWA'TC-HA! ErVTlH'.\nWHfVPS <HfVl?\n1 WAS i uST... free to overturn that precedent\nillustrates the farcical state of the\nbook which is supposed to govern\nthe Union's operation. And this\nreflects badly on the Union itself.\nUGM's. It is impossible to have\nsensible debates on U GM motions\nwhen the motions are distributed a few minutes before the U GM starts\nand students are not given adequate\ntime to read them. It is even more\ndifficult when the motions raised\ncontain intricate clauses in small\nprint. Moreover, it is all too easy for\npeople to slip in clauses which have\nfar reaching effects in motions\u2014\nwhich on the surface seem\ninnocuous.\nThe Officers who submitted the\nmotion allowing a vote of 'no\ncandidate' to the last U GM ought to\nhave known better than to gloss\nover the accompanying by-law\nchanges.\nHow many of the students\nattending the last U GM knew that,\nby voting in favour of a 'no\ncandidate' option in Union elections\nthey were also voting to prohibit\npart-time students from standing?\nThis was an issue which some\nstudents may have wished to\ndebate.\nCredits.I am frequently amazed by\nthe dedication shown by the FELIX\nstaff.

    "content": "Travel\nTklndependent\nSKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKIER SKI EA skier going down hill\nTo many people, skiing may seem\nto be a completely pointless sport.\nWhy should anyone want to spend\nseveral hundred pounds to\nexchange the cosines s of home at\nChristmas for a 'holiday' doing\nvigorous exercise in freezing\ntemperatures at the top of a mountain with the apparent\ninevitability of a broken leg?\nHowever, if this is your opinion\nof skiing holidays then your ideas\nare sadly outdated; thousands of\nfirst-time skiers each year can't be\nwrong. Modern advances in textiles\nnow enable skiers to keep warm in\neven the most extreme conditions,\nand any decent ski resort will by far\nsurpass the cosiest of homes with\nthe infamous a pre s ski. Advances in\nski equipment have dramatically\nreduced injuries to the point where\na broken leg is now extremely rare.\nIn fact, the most common skiing\ninjury is a broken thumb, and how\nmany skiers have you heard about\nwith that problem? And as far as\nexercise? Why not! The air is about\nas unpolluted as you can get and\nskiing is an excellent way of working\noff the Christmas and other festive\nindulgence.\nBy far the most popular resorts for '\nthe British are in the French, Italian,\nSwiss and Austrian Alps. Of these i areas, France generally is the\ncheapest with more modern\npurpose-built resorts such as [\nMeribel, Val dT sere and Les Arcs.\nItaly is slightly more expensive and\nSwitzerland and Austria are the\nmost expensive, especially in the socalled exclusive resorts such as\nVerbier, Klosters and Gstaad where\ngood a pre s ski compensates for the\nlimited skiing. There is also some\ncheap skiing in Scotland but the\nweather and snow are unreliable,\nand the falling dollar has made\nskiing in America slightly more\naffordable, although still out of the\nrange of most students.\nSo what should you expect on a ski holiday? Unfortunately\ntransporting thousands of people\nrapidly to such an isolated place is\nnot easy, so, at best, you should\nexpect a two hour coach journey\nafter a flight, or else a twenty hour\ncoach journey to the resort.\nHowever, the coach journey is not\nas horrific as it sounds as the\ncoaches all have air-conditioning,\nvideos, refreshments, toilets and\neither reclining seats or seats which\nconvert into bunks. On arrival you\nwill be issued with boots and skis\nif you have not brought your own.\nIt is very important to ensure that\nyour boots fit correctly as the wrong\nboots can be murder on your feet\nand will not help your skiing either.\nFinally you have everything\norganised and it is time to hit the\nslopes!\nYour instructor may be either\nfrom the holiday company or from\nthe local ski school (in which case\nhe will speak good English) but\nwhoever they work for, their job\ndepends on getting a good report\nfrom you so they will be very patient\nwith you, no matter how often you\nfall or need a rest.\nFor the beginner, the first few\ndays on the slopes may be\ndominated by the frustrating\nparadox of how easy it is to fall over\ncompared with getting back up\nagain. However, a few sessions on\na dry slope before the holiday will\nhopefully by-pass this stage and you\nwill proceed straight to the\nexhilaration of speeding along,\nquietly humming the theme to 'Ski\nSunday' to yourself, before the\ninevitable happens and you bury\nyourself in a snow drift. The\nprogress of beginners varies\naccording to their self-confidence to\nsome extent, but even the slowest\nof learners is able to ski down the\nnursery slope with ease within a week. The faster learners may even\nhave the confidence to tackle the\nhardest grade of slope, the black\nruns.\nThe process of skiing is\nsurprisingly tiring, partially due to\nthe altitude, but the slopes are well\nscattered with mountain bars and\nrestaurants so a liquid 'confidence\nbooster' is never far away.\nAfter a hard day's skiing, there is\nnothing better than to get back to\nthe apartment, remove the weights\nclamped to your feet, and flake out\nin a hot bath with a generous\nmeasure of-your duty-free. Sadly\nthough this euphoria cannot last\nsince there is still the a pre s ski to\ncome. Depending on the group you\nare with you could go to the local\nrestaurant, pub, bowling alley,\nbingo hall, night club, skating rink\nor just descend on someone else's apartment and drink their duty free.\nSleep tends to be instantaneous as\nyour head touches the pillow and\nyou wake up raring to go for\nanother day.\nFor the more advanced skiers,\nskiing is not limited to bombing\ndown the p is tes or trying to cut up\nthe beginners groups. For a small\nhire charge you can hire a mono ski or a surf-ski for the day, both of\nwhich are surprisingly easy to learn\nto drive but difficult to master. Ski\nballet, or freestyle, is rapidly\nbecoming a popular sport although,\nlike ski jumping, there are few\nplaces where it can be learned. The\nmore adventurous skiers can ski\nwhere no man has skied before by\ntouring from resort to resort, or by\nhe li skiing (using a helicopter to\nreach the most isolated slopes).\nHowever, I will admit that there\nis one problem with skiing: the cost.\nFor example, for a week's holiday\nin France, in the top resort of Val\nThorens, the prices range from \u00a3140\nto \u00a3300 for travel and self-catering\naccommodation only. To add to\nthis, the lift pass and insurance is\nanother \u00a3100 to make the basic price\nfor an experienced skier with his or\nher own equipment at least \u00a3240.\nHowever, for the beginner the price\nrises if you include lessons and\nequipment hire (at least \u00a3100) and\nthe necessary clothing (another\n\u00a3100, although jackets and gloves\nare useful in the British winter and\nclothes can sometimes be\nborrowed).\nBut before you give up hope of\never going skiing, there is some\ngood news. The IC Ski Club is going\nto Val Thorens this Christmas for\nonly \u00a3177! This price includes the lift\npass and insurance as well as travel\nand accommodation, and if you\nrequire ski and boot hire and lessons\nthey are only \u00a334 and \u00a343\nrespectively. This price is so low\nbecause we have negotiated a special group rate with a reputable\nand efficient company (it is the\ncompany which owns Les Arcs),\nand not because the company has\ncut corners with the holiday. If you\nwould like to try skiing for the first\ntime, or if you have already\nexperienced the excitement of skiing\nand would like a cheap holiday,\nplease come and talk to the Ski\nClub. We meet on Tuesdays and\nThursdays at 12.45pm in Southside\nLounge, but please hurry if you\nwould like to come on the holiday\nAnother skier\nsince all money must be paid by\nThursday November 17 (this\ndeadline has been extended due to\nthe late publication of this article).\nBut whether you go this year, or\nnext year, give skiing a try. It really\nis a fantastic sport\u2014thousands of\nfirst time skiers each year can't be\nwrong!\nJeremy Biddle\nPage 8 FELIX November 11 1988\n\n"
