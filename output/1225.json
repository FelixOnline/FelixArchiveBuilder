    "content": "felix talk\nln k well: The ArtSoc struggle\nImperial College prides herself on being a specialist institution. Her selection of\ncourses being arguably the most competitive and highly rated in the country, while\nshe sits regally at the peak of university\nleague tables amongst the finest institutions in the world.\nThe unfortunate result of this achievement however is that it has now come to\nbe regarded within the corridors of power\nthat the study of science and the appreciation of the arts must be mutually exclusive.\nIt was revealed late last session that\nUnion funding for the Art Society was to be\nsubstantially cut, as the idea of susi di sing students to enjoy opera and theatre was\nlittle more than a colossal waste of Union\nfunds.\nOf course the imp i cation of this, is that\nlovers of art who happen to be scholars of\nscience are denied the enjoyment of a hobby that many in other in st it u ions take\nfor granted. Not only has the Union failed\nto realise the enormous contribution the\nArtSoc makes to student life at IC, but like\nthe LE Q blunder, this once again speaks of\npoor insight and decision making.\nImperial College has neither Art nor\nSocial Science departments, and as efficient as the humanities department is, it\noffers little in the way of extra-curricular\nactivities for students. ArtSoc served as\nthe bridge between the shallow pocketed\nLondon student living on a government\nloan, and the pomp and culture of the performing arts, by providing tickets to highly\nacclaimed west-end productions at substantially discounted prices. But sadly the\nUnion does not realise this.\nThe \"democratically elected\" union has\nalso failed to see that ArtSoc stands as one\nof the biggest societies in the college with\na membership base of well over three hundred and fifty members. Do the principles\nof democracy and proportional representation not demand that funding be allocated\naccordingly to a society that houses a significant proportion of the student body?\nSadly, it seems the Union does not realise\nthis.\nAs Imperial College is located in\nLondon: the epicentre of the performing\narts, not only did ArtSoc further the appreciation of the arts in a purely scientific\ninstitution, it also served as a useful\nground for foreign students, enabling them\nto enjoy the sites of London, whilst mingling with ArtSoc students of other cultures and backgrounds in a non-academic\nsetting. Where ethnic societies further\ndivide the Imperial College student body\nalong racial lines, ArtSoc served as the\nmelting pot of cultures and backgrounds in\nan institution where racial divisions are\nnoticeable, and impossible to ignore. But\nsadly the Union does not seem to realise\nthis.\nThe concept of an all-round education\nmeans that students should be given the\nopportunity to engage in extra-curricular\nactivities that do not necessarily pertain\nto, or stem from their academic pursuits.\nAs the saying goes: To define is to limit. IC\nmay pride herself on being a fine specialist\ninstitution, but if she limits herself to being\none by suppressing the activities of a society that aims to bring the beauty of the\nperforming arts to the penniless student,\none doubts if the University Challenge success will ever be repeated.\nI am not looking to assume the role of the\nvoice of ArtSoc. In fact, let me assert that\nthe views expressed herein are in no way\nrepresentative of the views of the Art\nSociety. But when a \"democratically elect-ed\" student-representative-body drastically cuts funding to one of the biggest societies on campus, then one wonders what\nhas happened to principles of democracy\nthat we all should hold sacred.\nFunding to ArtSoc should be re-instated.\nA society that seeks to broaden, enlighten\nand expose should be appreciated not\nscorned. Sadly, the Union does not realise\nthis.\nNate Evuarherhe\nEditor al\nThis is my second attempt at this bloody\neditorial, and the first one was quite reasoned and rational, and then the ar sing computer crashed, so now I'm annoyed. So\nthis one's just going to be a real rant.\nI'm not going to continue on the subject\nof LEQs, since my main gripe is with the\nattitude of College to students in general.\nWhile I am not accusing Prof. Rawlings\nof this personally (having met him he\nseems to be one of the members of staff\nwho most cares about students), even he\nis beginning to exhibit symptoms of this\ntrait. In his letter he spoke of concern that\nonly 20% of students had bothered with\nthe LEQs, but there has never been a note\nof concern about the pitiful turn out that\nStudent Union elections have every year.\nAnd I am sure many College officials reading this now are thinking And why should\nwe', and many students may even agree.\nThis is the problem. The College is under\nobligation to have a students' union, and\nthis is where it seems to end. The fact that\nthe Union is here to represent the students\noften seems to be ignored, and in my job I have also found similar problems. I am\nmeant to find stuff out for you. That is my\njob. But many times I have tried to obtain a quote or information from some member of\nCollege or other, only to meet a stony\nsilence, or even abuse, along the lines of 'I don't have to tell you anything.'\nThis is ent i rly incorrect. College only\nexists to educate its attendees, and as\nsuch we are all well entitled to know what\nis going on. It seems to me that this important fact seems to have been forgotten in\nthe mists of bureaucracy and business of\nCollege life, and while the wonderful\nscores we get in all those things like\ngrants for research and lecturing, and the\nother things IC Reporter tells us about, it\nshould be remembered that these should\nbe the result of a good University. They\nshould not be the end goal in themselves.\nBut as you all probably know by now,\nwhile I like a good rant, I also like to be bal-an ced, and College is not entirely to blame\nin this situation. Most universities are run\nlike this now, and the government, with no\ngrants, and more fees, is obviously similar.\nOh well, eh?\nwill\n\n"

    "content": "college news\nIC To Gain Independence\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,\nhas announced that the\nCollege has applied to the\nUK's Privy Council for\nreserved powers to award its\nown degrees and so become a university in its own right.\nThe announcement was made\nduring the Rector's bi-annual\nquestion-and-answer session\nwith Imperial students on\n18th January.\nThe College currently\nawards degrees from the\nUniversity of London, a federal institution described by the\nRector as \" a conglomerate of\nlots of damn things.\" If\nawarded its own degree-awarding status, Imperial\nwill no longer be associated\nwith the federation and its\nunion, UL U. It is thought that\nIC could gain this independence within the next five\nyears.\nThe push for IC to award its\nown degrees is bound up\nwith the Rector's desire to\nimprove both public recognition and the reputation of the\nCollege both in the UK and\nfurther afield. Speaking to\nFelix after the address, the\nRector confirmed his intention for the College to become\na university in its own right\nand emphasised his belief\nthat the University of London\nwill see major changes over\nthe next five years: \"It's not\njust IC that's going down this\nroad. Other colleges, including King's and UCL, are also\nexploring doing the same.\"\nDeparture from UL U would\nresult in Imperial students\nlosing the benefits which come with membership.\nImperial College Union\nPresident, Sen Ganesh,\nwarned that \"if the union was\nto d is affiliate from UL U, we\nwould need to ensure that we\nget adequate compensation\nJjf * '\nThe Rector\nfor the loss of facilities and\nservices.\"\nSpeaking to Felix, UL U President, Justine Stephens,\ncalled Sir Richard Sykes'\nplans for an independent IC\n\"a blow to the federal collectivism that is the University of\nLondon.\"\nThe Rector spoke at length\nabout strengthening the\nImperial College brand and\nhis belief that having its own\ndegree-awarding powers\nwould help to improve the\nCollege's standing as a prestigious international university of the same calibre as\nOxford and Cambridge. An American student in the audience commented that\nImperial was almost unheard\nof in the United States and\nthat he had to tell friends\nback home that he was studying at 'the University of\nLondon' rather than 'Imperial\nCollege'.\nOther major issues of discussion were the College's sports facilities, student\naccommodation and the number of first-class degrees\nawarded, which the Rector\nsaid was being monitored, as\nit was one of the key measures used in university league\ntables.\nThe Rector also answered\nquestions regarding the\nrecently revised opening\nhours of the Central Library\nand the possible closure of\nsome departmental libraries.\nHe commented that library\nprovision across campus was\nunder review and that the\nway in which students use\nthese facilities was being\nmonitored. He also answered\nquestions relating to the\nCollege's new faculty st ruc ture, which is currently being\nimplemented.\nThe sale of the Teddington\nsports ground later this year\nwas both confirmed and\nexplicitly linked to the funding of the sports hall at South\nKensington. Few medical students were present and the\nmoment passed almost without comment.\nOn the subject of accommodation, the Rector confirmed\nthat Garden Hall will soon be\nsold to provide funds for the\nplanned refurbishment of the\nSouthside halls, which is now\nput at a cost of \u00a325 million.\nThis will result in the loss of\naround eighty-two bed-spaces, however it is thought\nthat these will be mainly double and triple rooms in the \u00a335\nto \u00a350 per week price range.\nThere are plans to refurbish\nthe hall before it is sold in\norder that it may achieve a higher price.\nThe College's Strategic\nPlan suggests that in order to\nmeet the guarantee of accommodation for all first year\nundergraduate students,\nreplacement accommodation\nwill be found in privately-owned developments. In\nresponse to questioning, the\nRector promised that students who were housed by\nthe College in. privately-owned accommodation would\npay rents \"controlled by the\nCollege\" and that they would\nbe \" in the same ballpark as\nBeit and Southside...if it's Issue 1225\n2 5 January2002 Editor: will Dugdale\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews: Vacant\nMusic: Dave Edwards\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nSports: Vacant\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nWith Thanks To:\nEtienne, John S Felix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nmore than that it will only be\nby a few pounds per week.\"\nHe also outlined his plans\nfor a new \u00a314 million building\non Dalby Court to house the\nadministrative departments\nthat currently occupy\nSherfield.

    "content": "talk back\nLE Q Dear FELLX\nNegative articles about the first Collegewide iteration of the electronic Lecturer\nEvaluation Questionnaire (LEQ) compel\nme to intrude into your pages to set the\nrecord straight.\nLet me start by stating that these articles do give well-earned plaudits to ICU\nfor assuming a greater involvement in the\nLEQ. Indeed from inception a couple of\nyears ago, student representatives have\nbeen supportive of the introduction of a web-based system. The articles also correctly identify a major contribution to the\npoor response as student apathy. The LEQ\nis part of the quality assurance procedures\naimed at improving the learning experience for students; completing the LE Q is\nto the benefit of current and future stu-dents. My view is that students have a responsibility to complete the LE Q just as\nCollege has a responsibility to consider\nand respond to the resulting data.\nBoth articles declare that the system is\ninherently insecure and that a public service was performed by those students who\nhad tried to hack it. These statements are\ninaccurate and misleading. The system\ndetected uninvited interference and identified two students who appeared to be\nusing privileged information gleaned from\nthe pilot study of last year. Both were\nreminded that the LE Q software, as with\nall software, is protected from hacking by\nCollege IT regulations, which they agreed\nto abide by when they signed on as\nCollege users. All College users, whether\nstudents or staff, are subject to these regulations and to disciplinary action if they\nshould contravene them. Thus the system\nis robust and was not successfully hacked.\nThe College has run a paper based LE Q since 1987 but this was showing its age in\nthe last few years of its life before becoming completely decrepit and thus unr eli able; its software was beyond repair. Even\nwhen operating to full capacity the system\nwas unable to read some responses, was\nslow and labour intensive.\nWith the enthusiastic support of the\nthen student representatives, the\nUndergraduate Studies Committee a couple of years ago commenced the development of a web-based LEQ. A trial in\nDecember 2000 involving six Departments\nproved to be flawed but nevertheless\nyielded valuable lessons and helped in the\nconstruction of the more robust version\nthat was exposed to science and engineering departments last month.\nI am a great supporter and regular reader of Felix and have been particularly surprised at the uncharacteristic and un reasoned hostility that has appeared in its\npages. The LEQ project team put a great\ndeal of effort into delivering a product\nwhich worked to its specification in that it\naccurately recorded the responses made\nand successfully collated the free form textual comments which under the paper system a poor scribe would have had to copy.\nThe electronic results were truly anonymous with Departments, including\nRegistry, being unable to track individual\nresponses; furthermore the results were\navailable within a couple of days of closure\nof the web site.\nThe most disappointing part of the exercise was the poor response rate by stu-dents, just over 20% of those eligible, and\nthe reasons for this are being examined\nand collated by departmental student rep-resent at ives. Those students who had difficulty\naccessing the system and who reported\nthis to the LE Q helpline had their access\nfixed rapidly in the main. Some students\nreported difficulty in accessing the LE Q site from halls of residence; this should not\nhave been a problem and the matter is\nbeing investigated, with students being\nadvised during the live running to access\nthe site from their Departmental server; a problem with access from Mechanical\nEngineering was not reported during the\nlive running of the LEQ and is being\nreviewed.\nThe Undergraduate Studies Committee\nwill be reviewing how to improve the promotion of the electronic LEQ among both\nstudents and academic staff so that the\nstudents feel more empowered to participate in this exercise which is one important (but not the sole) mechanism by\nwhich students can make their voice heard\nto Departments about the quality of undergraduate teaching; the optimum timing of\na survey will be one issue. It should be\npointed out that a web-based system is\nflexible and once it is established for LE Q it may be readily extended and modified to\nobtain student opinion on other education-al/welfare matters such as the personal\ntutoring system and research supervision.\nLet us work together to make a success\nof the web-based LE Q to everyone's bene-fit.\nYours sincerely,\nProfessor Rees Rawlings\nPro Rector (Educational Quality)\nAs editor, I feel that I should stick up for\nFelix, and insist that the hostility was neither uncharacteristic nor un reasoned. As\nthe vocal representative of all students at\nImperial, if something as fundamentally\nimportant as the LEQs is found to be a flawed system, then this gross oversight by\nCollege and the Union should be addressed.\nThe research (which was quite thorough)\nthat I myself carried out, indicated that the\nstudents were being held scapegoat, in\norder for College to save face.\nThe information I have received has\nadmittedly all come from non-staff members of College, but this is due to every single member of staff I asked having said 'no\ncomment'.\nTherefore the information I have recieved\nis only from 'non-trustworthy' students,\nbut nonetheless, the blame seems to be on\nCollege. Last year there was a button on\nthe LEQ website that took you to the\nadministrator page, and while this button\nhad been removed this year, the link was\nstill identical. Also I know personally that\nmore than two students 'accessed' this\npage, yet the two who are to be disciplined\nare the ones who published their findings\non a news server. So, no, the system wasn't hacked, the students just 'walked' in.\nHowever, as stated, Felix does believe\nthat LEQs are very important, but what we\nobjected to was College blaming students\nwhile refusing to either comment or apologise.( See Editorial for more ranting)\nThat' s Not A Hawk... Dear ed,\nI hope you dont mind the informal style of\nthis email, ed, but there is no place for\npleasantries in todays high-pace society.\nThe reason I write is simple. On the front\ncover of Issue 1224, you glee-fully state\n\"We like this helicopter...Black Hawk Down\nreviewed\" etc.etc. However, next to it you\nhave a picture of an Apache. Thats not a Hawk. So go figure. Do I get a prize?\nNo. Don't be an arse.\n\n"

    "content": "INTERVIEW with\nJames Lavelle\nreviews music\nVarious\nFabricLive.01\nmixed by JAMES LAVELLE Out now on Fabric records\nAs you load your CD player with this 70-minute mix by James\nLavelle, label manager of Mo'Wax and member of UNKLE, you'll\nprobably be expecting eclecticism, daring and sweltering\ndancefloor fever!\nIt's obvious that James Lavelle (pic above) likes a very wide\nspectrum of music indeed. He mixes abstract hip-hop, trip-hop,\nbreakbeat, pop and house music. Nevertheless, he gives attention to heavy beats, which he brings out on almost every track.\nMoreover, in spite of this variety of styles, the excellent mix\nquality makes it all fit together nicely.\nYou'll discover a lot of new names on this CD. Apart from the\nwell known Quannum, DJ Shadow (both on Mo'Wax), Chemical\nBrothers, Howie B, Orbital and Radiohead, you can listen to\nsome very interesting new sounds. The most impressive ones\nare Peter Dildo with his tribal rhythms, Green Velvet with their\ncatchy beats and the funny La La Land, and Buswacka! for The\nHealer, with its addictive digitized vocals and keyboards. Also,\ntracks 11 to 17 put some barely known artists together to form\na lively new musical entity.\nForget the dancefloor as James Lavelle starts rather quietly,\nwith abstract hip-hop featuring heavily on the first six tracks.\nThen the Chemical Brothers and Howie B open fire with Hey\nJack's fantastic percussion. Now your body begins to move to a frenzy of rhythms charged by heavy, repetitive beats as they\nprovide a mix between breakbeat and '80s sounds. Then Lavelle\nlinks all that with house music. He finishes up quietly, with an\nexcellent remix of Radiohead's Everything In Its Right Place\nthat combines pop and minimalist techno.\nThis record is not a vital addition to your collection, and it's not particularly good at making people dance. You discover a few new bands, and there's a really good Radiohead remix, but\nit doesn't ease the wait for the next UNKLE record.\nJames Lavelle is a resident at Fabric and the founder of Mo'Wax\nrecords. Felix asked him some questions over the telephone.\nFELIX: FabricLive.01, mixed by yourself, is out now [see\nreview, left]. What were you trying to achieve with the mix?\nJAMES: I wanted to convey musically what happens throughout the night at the club, so it's just like a snapshot of an\nevening at Fabric Live.\nMo'Wax was behind a lot of the bands in the trip-hop move-ment, but you've said in the past that you don't like the term\n\"trip-hop\". Why not?\nIt was something at the time - when you're doing what you're\ndoing, you don't really want to be told by the media what your\nmusic is. It wasn't really a term we'd have come up with our-selves, that was why. I think we just didn't want to be thrown\ninto a category, when the whole point of what we were trying\nto do was not be part of a category, you know? I don't really care\nanymore. This was seven or eight years ago.\nWhat's happening at Mo'Wax at the moment?\nThere's a lot of stuff coming out this year - there's the new\nShadow record, Psychonauts, Black Lodge, Scratch Perverts and\nlots more.\nIf the Mo'Wax label represents a lifestyle, what would that\nlifestyle be like?\nErm... not wanting to have a proper job! No, I think it just represents an area of culture we're all into. I think we're about graffiti and toys, and bike things.\nIs it fair to say that Mo'Wax is a hip-hop label?\nI don't think it's focused on hip-hop anymore. It's about a certain\nkind of mindset of artists and people, and always trying to push\nboundaries really. We don't always get it right, but we try!\nWhere would you like to see Mo'Wax heading in the future?\nI would like it to be something that survives and continually\nevolves and develops and pushes contemporary art.\nOut of all the roles you play - DJ, producer, businessman, etc.\n- what would you say is your true title?\nRecord collector! My collection's not bad; I have about 30,000\nrecords. I stole them all! Or they were sent to me, you know.\nWhat's the centre piece of your collection?\nProbably my old skool hip-hop collection is what I'm most proud\nof. This is going to sound quite trains pottery, but I also have all\nthe Beastie Boys records on white label, every Major Force\nrecord that was ever released in Japan and all the white labels\nand promos of very early hip-hop too.\nWhat do you think of the current music scene?\nI think it's really shallow at the moment, to be honest.\nEverything from pop to the new wave of rock, it all seems so\nclean and easy really. And that's not what I'm about!\nIs there anything you'd like to say to the Felix readers?\nJust enjoy the record really! Don't try to read too much into what\nit's about. I just hope that people get some enjoyment and some\ninspiration from it.\nFrangois TomX\n\n"

Saturday the 19th of\nJanuary 2002 and IC 3rds played Kings 2nds to stay in the\nULU reserves cup and to keep\ntheir incredible unbeaten run\nintact...\nKings were a bit late arriving\nto Harlington and turned out in\nmismatched kit and a couple of\nobvious ringers. Despite this,\nthe first fifteen minutes of the\ngame were all about the 3rds. Chances came and went think\nand fast but the ball just would-n't seem to hit the back of the\nnet. Jaime hit a post, Gabba had\na goal disallowed and Iain went\nclose. This scared Kings into\nwaking up and they started to\nproduce a couple of chances\nthemselves and only the intervention of Ricky in our goal and\nthe inside of the post kept the\nscores even.\nFinally the deadlock was broken in our favour. Sherlock got\nround the back of the defence,\ncrossed to Steakhouse who,\nrather than take it round the\nkeeper, opted to square the ball\nto Gabba who literally walked\nthe ball into the goal. The quite\nludicrously biased linesman\ntried to give it offside but the\nreferee pointed out that if you\npass the ball to a player behind\nyou, he can't be offside.\nOur second came from Gabba\nagain who was found space on\nthe right hand side of the area\nand slotted the ball in past an\nadvancing keeper. We went into\nthe break 2 - 0 up and feeling\nvery confident. No changes\nwere made by us but Kings tried\nto counter our dominance by\ntrying out our effective 3-5-2 for-mati on. This formation requires\nan able and effective sweeper\nwhich we had in the shape of\nDan. Kings did not have a good\nsweeper and their defence was\na rickety as ever.\nIC chances continued to be\nchurned out, Basis went close\nwith a free kick and a couple of\nruns through the middle, but the\nfinal touch was lacking. Lily\ncame on for Johnny and the\nHamster came on for Iain to consolidate our lead just before the\ngame took on its interesting\ntwist.\nIn a rare attack, Dhruve gave\naway a free kick on the edge of\nour area and when it was taken,\nthe wind got a hold of the ball\nand unluckily, it lobbed Ricky. 2-1 is far from safe and we were\nnervous and felt robbed that\nthey had scored with their first\nchance of the half but our\nresponse was swift. Jamie took\nthe ball from inside our half, ran\nall the way to the goal line and,\nat full stretch, lobbed the keeper\nfrom an impossible angle.\nQuality.\nOur fourth was sheer comedy.\nThey got a comer and, it being a cup tie, their keeper went up for\nit. Stupidly they played it short,\ngot caught in possession and\nthe ball was cleared. Their hapless keeper legged it back to his\ngoal unaware that the ball was\nrolling only a couple of feet\nbehind him. Gabba sprinted\nclear of the recovering defenders to be first to the ball and,\nwhen his shot was blocked, the\nHamster was on hand to knock\nin the rebound.\nIt finished 4 - 1 . We drubbed a team in the league above us to\nstay in the cup.\nImperial College Student Support Facilities\nHockey Success Who' s Here to Help You? IC 1st Team 4\nICSM 1st Team 0\nIC ended their Liverpool-esque\nrun of eight games without a win with a comprehensive\nquality crushing of medics.\nICSM has little answer to IC's tide of blue and white goal pie.\nWe arrived at the palatial\nunion at 11am for an early\npush back but were still waiting at 11:30. We eventually\narrived at for tess Harlington as\nwe were due to push back, but\nthat didn't stop the monster IC\ngoal machine.\nAfter a half of piss-taking,\nEssex Wide Boy scored from\ntypically short range. Shortly\nbefore Herpes' inspiring team\ntalk: \"Pain is fleeting, chicks\ndig scars and glory is forever!\"\n(What a tool!), Villager skillfully placed the ball between the\nkeeper and the far post, a feat\nhe was to repeat at a similar\ntime in the second half.\nAfter a spell of some total village hockey, epi tomis ed by\nGump trying to hatch out baby\nhockey balls, IC decided that\nthe Medics has been out their\nown half for long enough, and\nan awesome team goal was\nfinished off from about a foot\nby our resident Geography\nTeacher.\nGump then pelted the ball\nbetween the ICSM keeper's legs. I think the phrase is 'nut-meg'! Nice.\nThe scoring did not stop\nthere with Essex Wide Boy\nscoring another rubbish goal,\nbefore Villager repeated his\nfirst half cock-up with another\nspool of a mammoth prop or tion.\nWe are legends!\nUnion Advice Centre\nImperial College Union, Beit Quad, East Wing\nConfidential and impartial advice for students and staff on\nlegal, academic, financial, housing, immigration and benefits.\nMartin Thomson\n: Telephone: 020 7594-8067 e mail: advice@ic.ac.uk\n: Other Support Services\n: Chaplaincy Centra\n; Imperial College Union, Be it Quad.

Students will be able\nto contact these employers and apply\ndirectly.\nThe project aims to add to the number\nof jobs already available from departments and the careers service by mining\nthe membership of the City & Guilds\nCollege Association (CGCA). The CGC A consists of past and present students of\nCity & Guilds College. By requesting former students to consider offering place-ment s, we have been able to create extra\nopportunities for students looking for\nsummer work. Many of these opportunities will be unique to Imperial students,\nas some of these employers will not have\npreviously considered offering jobs.\nThere will also be a regular email\nnewsletter that you can sign up to when\nyou login to the site.

Your\nfriends are ethnically diverse and you are\ndaily being challenged to become more\nand more of a world citizen? No? Well,\npanic not. Help is at hand.\nThe Chaplaincy and faith societies are\norganising an afternoon trip on\nWednesday 13th February from 1 till 6 to\nvisit places of worship belonging to the\nmajor world faiths - yep, all in one after-noon. So if you've ever vaguely wondered\nwhat the differences are between a church, a mosque, a gud war a, a mandir\nand a synagogue but have been too busy\nto find out, now is the perfect chance.\nThe trip is part of the Chaplaincy's commitment to encouraging people of\nfaith on campus to come to know and\nunderstand one another - a task that\nseems the more urgent since the events of\nSeptember 11th last year. Bill Clinton,\nChaplaincy\nspeaking in the annual Richard Dimbleby\nlecture in December captured the essence\nof the challenge facing us all. \"Think\nabout how important your differences are\nto you,\" he said. \"Think about how we all\norganise our lives in little boxes: man,\nwoman; British, American; Muslim,\nChristian, Jew...Our little boxes are\nimportant to us. And indeed, [they are l necessary. How could you navigate life if\nyou didn't know the difference between a child and an adult, an African and an\nIndian, a scientist and a lawyer? But\nsomewhere along the way, we finally\ncome to understand that our life is more\nthan all these boxes we're in - and that, if\nwe can't reach beyond that, we'll never\nhave a full life... I don't want you to look\nat people who look different from you and\nsee a potential enemy, instead of a fellow-traveller.. .\"\nDon't be a box-dweller. Why not sign up\nfor the trip on Wednesday 13th February\nand be a better fellow-traveller as a result.\nAnd if you prefer to do your exploring\nfrom the comfort of a chair, then join us for\nTHE WEDNESDAY DISCUSSION which\ntakes up the same theme of being a fellow\ntraveller. This term's series 'Being\nHuman' draws together diverse speakers\nto help us explore what it means to be a person in the 21st century, when the challenge of difference is a daily experience.\nOn Wednesday 30th January, Eugene\nCulas from 'The Voice of Dalit\nInternational' will talk about human\nrights violations towards the Dalit\n(untouchable) communities in India. The\nfollowing week, Wednesday 6th February, the speaker will be Rabbi Gavin\nBroder, the University of London Jewish\nChaplain. The meetings take place in 6B in the East Basement of Beit Quad from 1\ntill 2.\nTo join the WORSHIP WHIZZ on the\n13th February or for a full programme and\nfurther information, contact The\nChaplaincy Centre on x49600 or on chap-la in cy@ ic.ac.uk\nCards, chocolates ami u if t* available fur the so cca il people in your life.\nshop ICU Newsagent+ Monday-Friday, 8:30am6:00 pm Monday-Friday, 8:45am6:00 pm "

    "content": "interview film\nINTERVIEW\nMichael Mann\nThe man who's bringing Mohammad Ali to our cinema screens\nnext month speaks candidly about the difficulty of transferring\nAli's larger-than-life persona to screen, his views on boxing, and\nthe clash between mythology and corruption in the sport.\nWhy do you think it has taken so long for a film about\nMohammed Ali to come to the screen?\nI think the reason is that Ali's life is so extraordinary. It's so dramatic and it has such extreme dynamics of sacrifice. What was\nactually intimidating about his life was how do you find one\npiece of it that would authentically do justice to the whole of it?\nTo do all of it reduces the experience. So you want to have a drama, it becomes a do cu drama, which is good. Wonderful\ndocumentaries were made, the finest of which is When We\nWere Kings. But his life is a truly extraordinary life. Will Smith\nand I probably exhausted ourselves for two years making this\nfilm, and what did we do? What we did was replicate a fraction\nof what he did and we didn't even do it for real! We made a motion picture! So, he is larger to me now than he actually was\ntwo years ago when we first started. Not as a person. As a person he is just a man sitting in a room with us, but the scale of\nwhat he did actually seems larger to me today than it did a couple of years ago.\nHow did you go about bringing Ali's persona to screen?\nIt evolved, it was very much a year spent with Will and myself\nlearning Ali-ness basically. With everything that Will had\nlearned and all the training, all to you have to do is to push him\noff the edge of a cliff. The only thing I'm going to ask Will for is\nbeing Ali in the moment and being totally spontaneous to it. So\nif there is an outrage like he has just been visited by a boxing\ncommission, and as he is coming down the stairs in the lobby,\nhe is just exploding. It's not about dropping my breathing to a different part of my solar-plexus so that my inclination drops\ninto Ali's range, and putting your tongue behind my teeth in a certain way so that I get the Kentucky sound. That all has to be\nabandoned, you have to be on a high wire without a net. But\nthe most difficult thing of all is to see and grasp and have\ninsights into things in advance of everybody else the way Ali did. Because Ali characteristically would. It's almost as if\n[that's] the way his mind worked. My job is to actually discover\nthe way Ali discovered, to think the way Ali thought. The hardest part of the struggle of actually becoming Ali, in my mind, is\nto be so totally immersed in character that you are actually\nthinking and dreaming the way Ali would. That's what we\nlooked for.\nHow did you go about capturing Ali's vocal mannerisms?\nWe would analyse an interview he did in 1965. Someone just\nstops him on the way into a Rooster in a Holiday Inn and asks\nhim if he has a prediction and Ali would say in five lines that he\ndidn't have a prediction, but he pronounced the word prediction\nthree times in a different way. And we were working on it and\nrealised he's three different characters in one paragraph.\nThe film is about a supreme boxer, but what is your view of\nboxing as a sport?\nI think, first of all, boxers are like actors, like directors. I mean,\nan actor isn't intimidated to get on the stage, he can't wait to\nget on the stage and he has to have his mind in that perspective. It's the same with a boxer. He may have anxiety in a fight\nbut, if he's prepared, he can't wait to get in that ring. The spectrum of boxing personalities we encountered on this film\nincluded intelligent, literate and decent guys. For these men,\nboxing is about commitment, courage, and strategy. It's an art\nand not two guys getting in a ring, hitting each other, with the\none who hits harder winning. That's not boxing.\nHow do you reconcile boxing mythology with the corruption\nthat has always been endemic to the sport?\nOf course. I'm not saying there's not corruption in boxing. In\nfact, the area where Ali learnt how to box was taken over by a couple of guys from Chicago and suddenly there were illegal\nfights. I remember being a kid in Chicago watching an unauthorised Friday night fight with my dad and all the bookmakers\nhad inside odds. There is plenty of corruption in boxing. At the\nsame time there was something real about boxing. There is all\nthat wonderful cultural history in the 1960s, tracking primarily\nMuhammad Ali's progress. So why did people watch it?\nBecause boxing is very corrupt, but it also elevates itself sometimes to become almost mythic. Clearly, the Rumble in the\nJungle, which is where we elected to end this film, was a perfect example of the mythology. Ali came to signify some kind of\naspiration to a lot of people all over the planet. He signified\nsomething positive to everyone. His opponent, George\nForeman, came to signify something else. He signified an in different, anonymous, disinterested power and the Frazier fight,\nwhich the film doesn't deal with that much, was absolutely an\nanalogue of a pro-life America. Everybody rooted for\nMohammad Ali and the establishment rooted for Foreman or\nFrazier. That's how it worked.\nThe film seems to deal with the history very fairly and hon-est ly, but has there been any negative reaction from people\nportrayed in it?\nNot so far. We have had a lot of contact with everybody in it.\nMalcolm X's daughter saw the film last week and liked the film\nvery, very much.\nDarius\n\n"

I am not a betting woman, but I would say\nthat the odds were against us!\nAfter about 15, a great pass\nto Teens gave US the first goal!\nThe crowd (someone from\nLSE's mum) was silenced, and\nwe realised that despite being\ntwo women down, we could\ndame d well win this thing!\nOur stunning second goal by\nMaewie-baby (her first for IC!)\nseemed to put a confused LSE\ninto panic mode, and rightly so,\nbecause by anyone's stan-dards, we were wir r ning! Oh, but then they got one\nback. No matter though,\nbecause by half-time, another\nsmooth attack and a beautiful\nstrike by Teens had made the\nscore 3-1 to us. Nice!\nWe geared ourselves up for a gruelling second half, in which\nthe strong wind would now be\nagainst us. LSE, having been\nshouted at by their three coach-es, piled on the pressure - especially in central midfield, giving\nIona lots of work to do. Goalie\nAnneke had to make several\nexcellent saves. But despite our\nbest defensive efforts, with Mo,\nRim, and Claire coping com-mend ably, they scored after\nabout fifteen minutes of relentless attacking.\nAnother scrappy LSE goal\nlate in the half, and suddenly,\nwe found ourselves at 3-3 with\n4 minutes left. Exhausted by\nour efforts so far, we gave it our\nall to try and get the winning\ngoal. Twice, our strikers Louise\nand Teens came aching ly close\nto getting the fourth, but it\nwasn't to be. What was to be\nwas an unimpressive, wind-assisted LSE goal, and the final\nwhistle being blown, in a seemingly very short space of time.\nSo there you have it. In the\nend, I think we had a bit too\nmuch to do. LSE got far more\nthan they bargained for with\nthe nine of us, so well done\neveryone!!\nLadies' Rugby\nSunday 20th January\nA soggy start to this term\ndown at Honour Oak Park\nended with a disappointingly\nsoggy score. We fought hard\nbut the highlights of the day\nwere the giant bath and\nsausage (or ve ge burgers! Lu),\nbeans and chips to follow.\nNever mind gir lies, things can\nonly get better.\nWednesday 23rd January\nWith our span gly new line-out\ncalls, fantastic scrum s and\nwonderfully brilliant team, we trekked to Harlington ready to\nwhoops some Royal Holloway\nass. The massive turnout at\nMonday's training session\npayed off to make today's match some of the best rugby\nwe've played this season. We\neven had a sub and two fab\nsupporters who rallied round\nwhen times got tough with a few choruses of \"ICU Babes!\nShaking that ass!\"\nQuote of the match from\nHolloway's front row: \"It hurts,\now!\" - well, it is a scrum, ladies.\nInjury of the match goes to an\ninanimate object! Thank you to\nall those who played and sup-ported, and let's make it an\neven better one next week!\nWell the year shot off to an\nimpressive start giving us\nanother victory. Unusually\nthe weather was on our side\nbut the court was ugly. As well as the mounds of gravel\nthere were also several used\nsparklers lying around. So\nwhen slipping on the gravel\n(which I managed quite a lot) we then had to avoid\nlanding on a sparkler and\nimpaling ourselves! Rumours\nare the netball courts are\nhome to closet sparkler\nusers! Anyway back to the\nmatch, the game started fairly messy but we soon gelled\nback together and by the last\nquarter the goals were flying\nin, excellent attack from\nMills, Jo and Jen! The umpire\nhowever was not so good,\nany attempt from our side to\ntouch the ball led to us being\npulled up for some reason.\nCommon examples were;\ncatching the ball perfectly,\nrunning too fast towards the\nball and finally for landing on\nour feet. However the other\nteam managed not to get\npulled up for throwing their\nweight at us and starting to\nplay basketball half way through! No bias there then!\nHats off to Sherry who got\nthe most of the umpire's bad side for basically being too\ntall! Oh well we still hammered them! So to sum up it\nwas netball on roller skates, with a blind umpire but we kicked a** e!

    "content": "music reviews\nLimp Bizkit\nNew Old Songs\nOut now on Flip / Interscope records\nThis album has no new material, just\nremixes of their old songs, hence the\ntitle. These remixes come from some of\nFred Durst's new-found friends, like The\nNeptunes, P Diddy, Timbaland and\nWilliam Orbit. There's more of a hip-hop\nfeel to all the songs, and it seems like the\nremixer s have put some real effort in.\nThe Neptunes are the most sought-after producers right now, for all types of\nmusic. From Britney to Limp Bizkit, they\nstill keep on the hip-hop side of things,\nand their tunes just make you stand up\nand take notice. Their remixes of Nookie\nand N2 Gether Now are definitely the\nhighlights of this album.\nThen we have aP Diddy remix, which\nisn't bad but has all the same old traits,\nlike the lines \"and we won't stop\" and\n\"this is the remix, bad boy\". Get some\nnew lines P but keep the beats.\nThe major disappointments on this\nalbum are the remixes of the most\nfamous songs, Take A Look Around and\nRollin'. The Rollin' remix sounds like bad\njungle, and Timbaland's remix of Take A Look Around just didn't do it for me. The\nbeat consisted solely of two notes of the\nMission Impossible sample repeated con-tin u ou sly, and really got on my nerves. I doubt that either of these songs really\nsuited a genre-changing remix.\nNew Old Songs is really just another\nmoney spinner. But although I prefer\nmost of the original songs, I do like the\nalbum. I'm not sure if it's value for money,\nas there are often multiple remixes.\nHowever, if you're a fan, then this will\ncomplement your collection.\nNeil Halstead\nSleeping On Roads\nOut this Monday on 4AD records\nFormerly of Slowdive and currently of\nMojave 3, Neil Halstead certainly has\nenough experience behind him to deliver\na semi-decent solo album. But this is far\nfrom semi-decent; it's bloody ace.\nMixing in a whole wealth of supporting\ninstruments behind the slow acoustic\nguitar, from deep synths to the typical\ncello/violin combo, this sturdily complete\nalbum of soft, mournful songs makes\nmost recent singer-songwriters seem\nlike Pop Idol rejects. It revels in influences and comparisons by the dozen,\nsuccessfully melding the best of the male\nsinger-songwriter genre from the '60s( Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel) with the\nleading lights of recent times (David\nGray without the radio overkill, Kings of\nConvenience).\nOK, so this is not party music. It does-n't shake your rump or tell tales of how\nsuccessful the guy is with the lay dees. There are no sing-a long-a Max-style\nchoruses and it will not prompt you to\ndye your hair stupid colours and pierce\nyour face with bits of metal. But hey,\neveryone occasionally needs music for\nthe long, dark teatime of the soul, and\nthis album does the job very, very well.\nThoroughly recommended.\nVarious\n...Not A Soundclash\nOut Monday 4 February on Nuphonic\nIThe full title is This Is Not A Soundclash,\nand the album retails at \u00a32.99].\nWhile Nuphonic doesn't make any pretentious claims for its music, it is known\nfor producing consistently good tunes:\ndance able, hum mable, enjoyable tunes.\nSurely then, this compilation is a good\nbet?\nUnfortunately, Nuphonic have come up\nwith a dull, shockingly limited example\nof their wares. Its un inventive, lazy\nbeats, its overlong mixes and its awful\nlyrics are, for the most part, stupefying.\nMarginal exceptions are Groove\nArmada's mix of And That's Saying a Lot\nby Natural Calamity, and The Sky Is Not\nCrying by Tiny Trendies. And it would be\nunfair not to include Block 16's Morning\nSun, a track that has some of the soul\nthat the others manifestly lack.\nPerhaps dance music has progressed\nso much in recent years that \"seminal\" or\n\"classic\" tracks now sound unimpressive\nand un ambitious. Or perhaps Nuphonic\nsimply don't have enough really good\ntunes to fill all their compilation albums.\nWhatever the reason, a foray into the\n\"Best Selling Compilations\" section in\nHMV will guarantee a better buy than\nthis.\nBen Libby\nICO Oscar\nCOMPETITION This week, we're giving away 25 & Alive: Boneshaker, a DVD and bonus CD of\nMotorhead playing live at Brixton Academy on 22 October 2000.\nQUESTION: What was Motorhead's original name?\nPlease email your answer, along with your name, year and department, to\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 31 January.\nThe winner of the Ash competition from Issue 1223 is Alison Twelvetrees of\nBiochemistry I, who wins the Ash video Tokyo Blitz.\n\n"

A large increase in\npart membership followed; as\na direct result, the fascists say.\nWhile the party hopes for a return to the chest-wigged\nbarnet-bearing glory days of\nold, leftist commentators within the Italian media and government have insisted that the\nnovel - written partially during\nthe Second World\nWar - may actually be\nread as a cautionary\ntale of fascist opp res sion, and of a collective (elves, men,\ndwarves and hob-bits) triumph over an\nomnipotent evil (the\nevil Sauron).\nTolkien, who died in 1973,\nalways insisted that there was\nno political dimension to his\nwork, and sought to distance\nhimself from political interpretations of the story, which he\nconsidered to be more\nmyth o poe ic in nature.\nJoe\n<2\nS \u2014^ its\nElery Wednesday\nCocktails in the UDH\nHon-Alcoholic Drinks a Cocktail Specials\nBars til midnight Dance'til 1am Late Night Chilli and Fries\n\u2022* imperial\n>\u2022 college\nJunk\nThousands of tonnes of scrap\nmetal originally part of the\nWorld Trade Centre are being\nshipped to the Far East,\nReuters reports.\nNearly half a million tonnes\nof scrap are to be\ntransported to\nIndia and China,\nwhere they will be\nrecycled and\nreused for new projects.\nSteel salvaged *\nform the gutted and pg j destroyed building\nis actually quite valuable, due\nto its resistance to corrosion\nand weathering.\nAs well as thousands of two-foot thick girders from the shell\nof the building, rescue and salvage operations have also\nyielded burnt yet usable items\nof office furniture, such as\ndesks, filing cabinets and the\noccasional Bauhaus-era all-metal basket chair, all of which\nsurvived the blast.\nZimbabwe\nANS: The eyes of the international media continued to gaze\nupon the former\ncolony of 1\nZimbabwe this\nweek, as the ARC I( a body of fellow\nAfrican nations\nostensibly dedicated to championing new democracies) declared its\nacceptance of ruler President\nMugabe's electoral plans. The\n78-year-old ruler has agreed to\nhold elections this year to find\na new ruler, which he insists\nwill be free and democratic.\nHowever, spectators have\ncalled for Mugabe - who instituted the controversial 'land-redistribution' policy that\nparcels out land formerly\nowned by white colonists to\nblacks in the colony - to stand\ndown.\nThough he insists the elections, to be held this May, will\nbe both fair and truly demo-crat ic, spectators have\nexpressed reservations.\nMugabe owns or controls nearly all of the\nstate media in the\ncountry, including\nthree TV channels\nand seven of the\ncountry's radio sta-t ions.

(Page 5)\nSummer Ball Revived\nIn a dramatic reversal of fortune, the\nSummer Ball has been raised from the\ndead. While it is certainly still in critical\ncondition (to extend a metaphor), hopes\nare now once again high that the end of\nyear party will go ahead.\nLast week, Felix reported that the Ball\nwould be axed, but on the same day that\nFelix came out, it was revealed that the\n\u00a320,000 gap in funds would be covered by\nCollege.\nSen Ganesh, Union President, had informed Council during last week's ses-sion, that it would be in viable to have a Ball this year due to lack of cash. This\nannouncement was greeted with disappointment by a majority of students, but\nthe reality of the situation made this decision necessary.\nHowever, Mr. Ganesh had spoken to\nCollege at the beginning of last week,\nand they had offered to underwrite the\nBaU to the tune of \u00a320,000, but this had\nbeen in place of paying back a grant that\nthe Union insists that College owes any-way. This was deemed unacceptable by\nBumper Cars At Last Year's Ball\nUnion officials, and therefore the loss that\nwould be made on the Ball would be too\nlarge to swallow.\nHowever, on meeting with the Rector,\nSir Richard Sykes, a few days later, Mr.\nGanesh explained the decision, and surprised everyone by emerging with the\nnecessary money, given to the Union as a gift from College.\nWhile this is undeniably a very kind\ngift, there must be some reasons for it.\nTom Miller, College Press Officer, said\n\"College sees this as very important part\nof College life\", explaining that it had\nbeen such a great success last year that it\nwould be seen as a great shame not to\nhave one again.\nAdmittedly this money does not cover\nthe full cost of the Ball, but the Union now\nneeds only a further \u00a310,000 to ensure no\nloss is made. This money will probably\ncome from corporate sponsorship.\nOne of the questions if the Ball does go\nahead is that of the venue. While the decision is ultimately the Union's, no word\nhas yet been heard from them on this sub-j ect. Mr. Miller, speaking for College, said\n\"College is right behind holding it on the\nCollege grounds, and we think it's the\nright place to hold it.\"\nwill\n\u2022 h TJijs ee yi g either your\ners are gon n end up on th J wi c Rar fsh?^ Tiny s ez 'Do Da Crossword\n\n"

Hosting some of the most\nexperimental music shows in London, the atmosphere is never\none of exclusivity or pretension. And tonight is no exception.\nWith the venue's laid-back ambience and eclectic air, the crowd\nseem sincerely excited about the line-up.\nWauvenfold, aka Tom Hill and Noel Murphy, spellbind the\ncrowd with their full Powerbook artillery. Squeezing furious\nnoise motifs into glorious glitch soundscapes, the duo contort\ntheir beats, clicks and gurgles through countless pedals, Kaos\npads and a mixer. The results are imaginative and humorous\nrenditions of songs from their two EPs and forthcoming album.\nTom continuously giggles, obviously not intending to play\nexactly what he is playing, yet making a mighty fine job of it.\nNoel hides behind the mixer, visibly shaking with laughter (at\nTom, one presumes, though it's impossible to tell 100% with this\nband). Grinning throughout their set, Wauvenfold clearly enjoy\nplaying their music as much as the audience enjoy listening.\n\"When you see a laptop on stage, you might be at a Kid606\nshow, you might be at a Matmos show, but if you're really\nunlucky you might imminently be watching Her Space Holiday\"\nannounces the jarring computerised voice of HSH's Powerbook,\nwhich introduces the band and each song.\nHer Space Holiday is the brainchild of Marc Bianchi, who uses\ntechnology to create rhythms over which he lays down voc oder musings and self-effacing guitar passages. Few bands are as\nmodest and unassuming as HSH - the computer issues the apology: \"Congratulations to those who've made it through a couple\nof our songs; unfortunately there are still a lot to go\".\nHSH write saccharine, unpredictable yet sentimental songs\nabout love and loss; about hope and giving up. They are the\nhonest and authentic sound of the US underground pop scene.\nDon't be afraid to put all your trust in them.\nOUT THIS WEEK\nThe following musical delights should appear in all good\nrecord shops on Monday 28 January.

Name-checking\nFugazi and Deftones as major influences, HIFH are a hailstorm\nof righteous anger and bilious angst. Live, they're a truly kick-ass band, but this single really doesn't do them justice. It's not\nbad - it's loud and tuneful and pretty angry - but it's just not one\nof their best songs. Stick with them until the album comes out\nor go and see them live. You won't be let down.\nTom M JIMMY EAT WORLD The Middle\nFresh from their sellout show at the Astoria, Rock Sound's \"brightest hopes for 2002\" release another slice of melodic\npower-pop. Taken from their self-titled album, this is two minutes of uplifting yet unoriginal MOR. With vocals mildly reminiscent of an americanized Tim Wheeler, The Middle is a like-able, albeit unremarkable, tune.\nSajini\nALKALINE TRIO - Private Eye\nHey, someone still remembers Therapy? and the all-out indie\nrock nonsense that came out of the Midlands. Most of the bands\ninvolved are currently trying to reform before young upstarts\nlike these take over. Indie rock? Indie rocks!\nRobert\nASH There's A Star\nGone are the almost grungy sounds from Ash's beginnings.\nInstead, we have nicely polished pop-rock. There's a Star is one\nof the slower tracks from i^ ee All Angels, and it might not rock\nmuch, but you can still dance to it. With its chilled guitar solo\nand orchestral backing, this song does seem to sparkle.\nChris ID Robin\n\n"

    "content": "18\nMohammad AM\n\"Beyond Reproach?\"\nThis week in film, the first part in a two part Ali special.\nAli. A man as famous for his exploits in the ring as his political\ndissidence and spirit outside the ring. In an age when words\nmeant something, he used them to transcend his limits as a sportsman and became a legend. A figure who sacrificed everything for his beliefs, a man who was loved and despised in\nequal measure, and a man who, in alleviating the suffering of\nAfrica and Black America, saw his mission in life.\nThis is the myth. The question is, was Ali for real? Was he a man who affected real political change, or a gifted boxer whose\ngarrulousness made him an ideal propaganda tool for extremists like Louis Farrakhan and Malcolm X? Either way, however,\nMohammad Ali represented a dissolution of the Black Power\nmovement into popular culture. Here was a man who advocated the views of extremists such as Elijah Mohammad, and who\nwas seen in the company of the Beatles. He was a dampen er on\na political movement that threatened America with racial\nupheaval.\nWhat was his legacy to Black America? Mohammad Ali came\nto epi to mise everything that Black America was and still is not.\nHe had money, he had success, he had power and he had a political voice. But Mohammad Ali's real impact was wholly illusion ary The truth is that Ali was the centre piece of the 1960s cultural\nrevolution. A folk-hero and myth, whose assimilation into\ntoday's popular consciousness is nothing but a detraction from\neverything he stood for. A man who aligned himself with The\nNation Of Islam, a group openly proclaiming \"the white man is\nthe devil\", is now the darling of liberals everywhere. It is this\nkind of double-think that moulds our current interpretation of\nthe myth of Mohammad Ali.\nThe ultimate popular icon. The ultimate example of modern\nmyth. And certainly not beyond reproach. Before making up\nyour own mind, you should go and see Michael Mann's Ali,\nreleased on the 15th February. Interesting and potentially controversial stuff.\nfilm interview\nPROFILE\nMichael Mann\nBorn in Chicago on 5th Feb 1943, Michael Thomas Mann studied at the University of Wisconsin, before moving to the UK to\nstudy at the London Film School.\nHe quickly gained notoriety as a versatile TV director working\non titles such as Starsky and Hutch and Police Story. His career\neventually took off with Thief (1981), an intelligent crime caper\nwhich earned Mann a Palme D 'Or award and, more importantly,\nrespect. Subsequent films, such as The Keep (1983) and\nManhunter (1986), confirmed his status as a talented and stylish director.\nThroughout the 1980s Mann worked on the wildly successful\nMiami Vice, thus cementing his reputation. Major success finally arrived when he co-wrote, produced, and directed The Last of\nthe Mohicans (1992). Then came his most commercially successful movie, the Los Angeles crime saga Heat (1995), featuring the only screen meeting between acting legends Pacino and\nDe Niro. Heat became an ultra-contemporary and uber-cool\narena for yuppie fantasy. It was De Niro the thief immersed in a quasi-religious code of discipline and prudence, versus Pacino\nthe freewheeling loud-mouthed copper, living and working by\ninstinct and whim. It was Mann's finest movie and made over\n$100 million, mainly outside the US.\nHeat gave Mann room and money to make the commercial\nfailure and critical success that was his last movie, The Insider\n(1999). In this movie he surpassed even Heat, with superior dialogue and' photography. His achievement was recognised with\nseven Oscar nominations and countless other awards from\naround the world. It was perhaps its anti-establishment theme\nthat denied it an Oscar, but The Insider will be remembered for\nits brutally honest portrayal of the greed of American tobacco\ncompanies.\nSuffice to say that Michael Mann was the ideal candidate to\nmake a movie about one of the greatest cultural and sporting\nicons of our time. The movie comes out in the West End on the\n15th February. When all the plaudits are going to Will Smith's potentially Oscar-winning performance, don't forget the Mann\nbehind the camera.\n\n"

    "content": "felix talk\nIC Radio\nSo what's on IC Rodeo(sic) this week? I thought I'd bring you a quick summary of\nfour of our best shows. In coming weeks\nwe'll have some interviews with the presenters of said shows, as well as details\nof forthcoming events. Of course, if you're\nout doing all manner of exciting things at\nthe time your favourite show is on, you\ncan listen to it on the website later, at\nhttp://ic radio. com/relive. Of course, if\nyou're sitting at home at the time, lonely\nand bored, tune in to 999AM( Linstead\nand Southside halls) or the web stream. Felix Forty-Five with will Dugdale.\nMon day 11pm midnight. The random late-night ramblings of a( usually drunk) Felix editor. Monday\nnight, as you may not know, is deadline\nnight for this lovely publication. As such,\nWill sees it fit to get somewhat intoxicated and ramble at anyone who is mad\nenough to still be up, and who isn't out\ndoing better things with their life. All this\nvia the miracle of technology that is IC\nRadio. There's usually a competition or\ntwo, and the munch of Chinese food\nbeing chewed in the background.\nThe IC Radio Breakfast show with Steve.\nMonday Tuesday & Friday Mornings 8-10am. Something nice to wake up to. Tune your\nalarm clocks to 999AM and be woken by\na selection of soothing chilled music, both\nfrom the charts and rarer stuff. Or at least,\nthat's the first hour... The second hour\ntakes a more sinister turn, with louder\nand harder music with an occasional\npunk/metal tinge to it. The thinking is,\nthat by nine, if you haven't got a lecture,\nyou should be awake anyway. Why\nshould only some of us have to suffer? Of\ncourse, there's a selection of random rambling and bizarre burbling too.\nCheesy Lunch with 'Cheesy' John Stratford.\nWednesday Lunchtime, 12-l pm. John brings you the very finest in musical\nstilton. Every track a classic, or your\nmoney back. Useful info about the tracks\nand the bands, so you can swot up on all\nthose things you hear in the Union when\nyou're blind drunk, and impress your\nfriends by failing to remember by\nWednesday night. Bargain.\nDrivetime with Dave Edwards.\nMondays and Thursdays, 5-7pm. Dave knows what's what when it comes\nto the latest mainstream music, and usually has a couple of guests along for the\nshow to lower the tone and generally supply comedy interludes in what is possibly\nthe best collection of new music anywhere on radio. The people who brought\nus \"Tube or Trout' (the comedy quiz show)\nhave various competitions where you can\nwin the latest singles or a variety of other\nprizes, and the now infamous 'Joke of the\nDay'.\nAnd for info on what other shows are\navailable, check out the website...\nic radio* www.ic radio. com II\nMedics' Rag Ramble\nThis year's Medics' Rag kicked off just\nbefore Christmas, with our annual Carol\nsinging venture just before Christmas.\nWe raised a sleek \u00a3688.60 for CLIC\n(Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood),\nthis year's designated charity; work I think you'll agree not a bad day's. We\nthought a good place as any would be\nVictoria station at rush hour. We sang for\nnigh on 6 hours straight. People were\neventually paying us to shut up, 'cause\nthey were so sick of us. Since then, we\nhave moved onto bigger and better things\n- Rag Dash.\nThis year's Rag Dash consisted of a pissed hitch-hike up to the sunny climbs\nof Nottingham. With over 200 people\ndashing, this seemed a bit optimistic but\nin the end, everyone managed it, a little\nworse for wear to say the least, but booze\nwill do that to you if you consume over 3\ntimes the monthly limit of a Hippo.\nThe lot of us boogied the night away at\na club called McClusky's, an amicable little nightclub which unfortunately did a2 for-1 offer on cocktails; those who had not\nsuccumbed soon fell foul. At lam, we\nwere all kicked out and piled onto 4\nbusses which began the long trek\novernight to Edinburgh. Sleep came easily to some people who'd drunk the equivalent to a Horse's dose of Ketamine.\nHowever, my sleep was inhibited by the\nbabbling s of two alcoholics, JB and Bill,\nwho could only spout shit for hours upon\nend.\nFor the rest of the day, the das her s were\nleft to their own devices. Hardcore dash-ers went to a pub or a bar and carried on\nboozing until they could no longer walk.\nHowever, if their legs still functioned,\nthey were free to join an organised Pub\ncrawl to finish off any part of their liver\nthat was still functioning. If that wasn't enough, post Pub crawl, das her s were\nfree to go to a classy club called\n'Revolution' (since we had managed to get\non the guest list). I can't remember getting into the club but I remember spending a lot of money in a kebab shop on my\nway .home.\nNext day, we finally headed for home.\nMy coach resembled a sauna since the\ndriver was having issues with the heat-ing. The journey lasted for about 9 hours\nand when home, those who had some\nkind of brain went straight to bed; those\nwho were clinically insane went to the\npub.\nNext day, the rag committee had to\ncount all the hard earned money. We had\nsomehow managed to collect the staggering amount of \u00a36,015.85 in just 3 days of\nhard boozing. Not bad at all. Our Rag\nweek is next week (28th Jan-l st Feb),\nmake sure you get involved! Saf\n\n"
