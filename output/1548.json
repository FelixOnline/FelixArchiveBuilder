    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 FRIDAY 24 MAY\nJohn Park Film Editor\n16. The Dark Knight\nWorldwide gross: $1,004,558,444\nWhy? Anticipation was through the\nroof for Christopher Nolan\u2019s followup to his highly praised Batman\nBegins and the press coverage on the\nsudden death of its star Heath Ledger\ncertainly put the \ufb01lm on a lot of the\nfront headlines. His outstanding\nperformance as the Joker (he won an\nOscar for playing a Batman villain \u2013\nthis never happens) was every \ufb01lm\ncritic\u2019s talking point, and the overall\nreviews could not have been more\necstatic. Its opening weekend was\nthe highest on record at that point,\nand it held steadily on, slipping very\nlittle throughout subsequent weeks,\nalthough in a cheeky move, the studio\ndid re-release the \ufb01lm in the States to\npush its total money intake past that\nbillion line.\nThe Billion Do\nCongratulations are in order for Iron\nMan 3 and its associated Marvel Universe, as within 3 weeks of its international release date, the third Tony\nStark picture has already generated\nmore than one billion dollars at the\nworldwide box o\ufb03ce. Robert Downey\nJr.\u2019s latest e\ufb00ort joins a surprisingly\nlong list of \ufb01lms that have already\ndone so, although to his credit, a lot of\nthe \ufb01lms on the list reached the milestone near the end of their box o\ufb03ce\nruns. Given Iron Man 3 still has a\nlong way to go before it is pulled from\nthe theatres, we can expect the \ufb01lm\nto keep moving up in its total gross.\nAnd although Downey Jr.\u2019s return for\na possible fourth adaptation remains\nin doubt, Marvel Studios president\nKevin Feige expects the Iron Man\nfranchise to remain \u201cas evergreen as\nJames Bond.\u201d\nBut to celebrate the biggest moneymaking \ufb01lms so far, Felix Film takes a\nlook at just what made each and every\none of them so special that audiences\nworldwide \ufb02ocked to the theatres to\nwatch them on the big screen.\n15. The Hobbit: An\nUnexpected Journey\nWorldwide gross: $1,017,003,568\nWhy? With Peter Jackson returning\nbehind the cameras to take us back\nto Middle Earth, no LOTR fan would\nhave said no to this. There were\nconcerns over Jackson splitting a\nrather thin book into three \ufb01lms but\nthis gamble seems to have paid off\nsince the \ufb01rst in a trilogy has already\nmade a billion. No matter how long\nor seemingly dull, Jackson\u2019s visual\nmastery is always worth catching on\nthe big screen. This also enjoyed the\nbig Christmas and end-of-year push,\ntypically the hot-spots for studios\nto release their big epic \ufb01lms. And\nlet\u2019s not forget about the brilliant\nAndy Serkis, without whom Gollum\nwouldn\u2019t exist.\n14. Alice in Wonderland\nWorldwide gross: $1,024,299,904\nWhy? Summer came early in 2010\nas audiences rushed to the screens\nto keep their important date with\nTim Burton and Johnny Depp. The\nBurton-Depp pairing is one that is\nhugely appealing given the right\naccessible source material (so no,\n\ufb01lms like Ed Wood don\u2019t cross the\nbillion mark). This was smartly\nmarketed by Disney as a colourful,\nall-round fun experience for the\nwhole family, whilst also cashing in\non the then-newly booming business\nof adding an extra dimension and\ntherefore throwing in some glasses\nand a couple of quid to the ticket\nprices. Outstanding international\nticket sales came from Japan, where\nit grossed $130 million + (its 11th best\nnon-Japanese \ufb01lm).\n13. Star Wars Episode I:\nThe Phantom Menace\nWorldwide gross: $1,027,044,677\nWhy? Everyone loves to hate the new\nStar Wars \ufb01lms, and it all started here,\nwith a billion-dollar grossing prequel.\nGeorge Lucas, in his high and mighty\nstanding in Hollywood, was paid an\nunbelievable sum of $400,000,000 in\ntotal for his efforts on the \ufb01lm - that\u2019s\nmore than a lot of \ufb01lms even dream\nof making in their run. Because of\nthe phenomenal hype surrounding\nthe \ufb01lm, few major studios dared\nreleasing anything in the same week\nas Lucas\u2019 big space comeback. An\nestimated number of 2.2 million full-time employees missed work days to\nattend the \ufb01lm \u2013 it was that much of\nan exciting \ufb01lm event. The 2012 3D\nre-release helped surpass one billion.\n7. Skyfall\nWorldwide gross: $1,108,561,013\nWhy? 007 was in dire need of a fresh\nnew start even since Quantum of\nSolace came out and ruined whatever\ngood that was set up from Casino\nRoyale. With Sam Mendes stepping\ninto the director role, Daniel Craig\nreturning, a meaty sub-plot for the\n\ufb01ercely talented national treasure\nJudi Dench, plus that Adele song,\nmany agree that Skyfall is the best\n007 \ufb01lm yet. As UK\u2019s highest grossing\n\ufb01lm of all time, 007\u2019s home country\nadded a whopping $160 million + to\nits international total, and the rest\nof Europe (France and Germany in\nparticular) followed, with China also\nnot far behind. With Christopher\nNolan now in talks to direct the next\none, can this record be broken in a\nfew years\u2019 time?\n6. The Lord of the\nRings: The Return of\nthe King\nWorldwide gross: $1,119,929,521\nWhy? Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the\nRings trilogy came to a fantastic close\nwith Return of the King, where epic\nbattles and emotions swept across\nthe screen over a 3-hour running time\n\u2013 the build-up from The Fellowship\nof the Ring and The Two Towers paid\noff here, and sweeping the Academy\nAwards in 2004 gave the \ufb01lm an ever-so slight bump in the box office. The\nChristmas/end-of-year season was\nalsoinplayhere,aswellasthepromise\nof a grand scale and extraordinary\nspectacle. One of the earliest to cross\nthe billion mark, when 3D wasn\u2019t in\nuse, this is no doubt Jackson\u2019s biggest\naccomplishment.\n5. Transformers: Dark\nof the Moon\nWorldwide gross: $1,123,745,996\nWhy? Critics hate Michael Bay,\nbut that\u2019s of no trouble or any\nconsequence to the director, as he\nwill always have his loyal followers of\naction-junkies who only ask for some\ndumb fun, which is exactly what is\ndelivered here. \u201cI make movies for\nteenage boys. Oh, dear, what a crime\u201d\nhe says, and it appears this is his\nmotto for making any of his \ufb01lms. But\nkudos to him \u2013 many of his \ufb01lms are\nconsistently regarded as box office\nsuccess stories and ideal for summer\naudiences, where students are out\nof school. The Asian market (China,\nSouth Korea) gave some signi\ufb01cant\ninput too, where the robot franchise\nis hugely popular.\n4. Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows Part 2\nWorldwide gross: $1,341,511,219\nWhy? The \ufb01nal \ufb01lm of one of the\nmost successful \ufb01lm franchises in\nhistory, this \ufb01nale conjured up $32\nmillion worth of advance tickets,\nsetting a new record, whereas\nthe $169 million North American\nopening weekend made history, until\nit was beaten a year later by a group\nof superheroes. More impressive (as\nif the \ufb01lm doesn\u2019t have enough to\nboast about), its worldwide opening\nof $483 million in one weekend is\nstill the one to beat. Better luck next\ntime Avengers. Audiences loved\nseeing Hogwarts get torn apart by\nevil wizards/witches, and the ensuing\nbattle was suitably thrilling with the\nlarge ensemble cast giving it their all.\n\n"

    "content": "13\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\n12 FRIDAY 24 MAY SEX SURVEY\nSEX SURVEY\nMASTURBATION\nWho's conducting experiments on themselves?\nSEX AROUND THE CITY\nSEX TOYS / DRESSUP\nThis year we wanted to \ufb01nd out all\nabout your sex toys. How many of you\nhave a cheeky little device hidden in\nthe bottom of a drawer? Maybe you\nhave it in pride of place on your man-telpiece. Probably not. Regardless of\nwhere you keep it, it was interesting to\nnote their use.\nWe found that 25% of people used\nsex toys of some kind. 19% of men\nand 34% of women used them (not\ntoo shocking there). Interestingly 90%\nof virgins didn\u2019t use sex toys. If you\u2019re\nin a relationship you\u2019re twice as likely\nto be using a rampant rabbit or other\nsuch device. It seemed like straight\npeople were much less likely to use\nsex toys than their gay, lesbian, and\nbisexual counterparts.\nIt seems that those of you that indulge in sex toys are adventurous\nenough to use them with your partners as well, with the \u201cOn your partner\u201d and \u201cOn both\u201d options totalling\naround 2/3 of responses.\nWhether sex toys make you happier or not is debatable. We\u2019re at Imperial, so we\u2019ll give you the \ufb01gures.\n32% of people who are happy or very\nhappy with their sex lives use sex toys,\nwhereas 14% of the unhappy or very\nunhappy were using sex toys. 44% of\nwomen who were very happy used sex\ntoys. So, if you want to make your girl\nElectronic stimulation\nfor the Imperial nation?\nTHREESOMES\nWanking, frigging, adjusting the an-tenna, shining the diamond, scratching the patch, cleaning the ri\ufb02e, and\nmany other euphemisms describe this\nsection. That\u2019s right Imperial, how often do you masturbate?\nAs society leads us to believe, men\nare complete wankers with 24% of\nmale survey respondents admitting to\na daily rub and a whopping 42% celebrating themselves a few times a week.\nIn fact a total of 83% of male survey\ntakers shake it out at least once a week.\nMaybe think before shaking hands\nwith the next guy you meet!\nWhat is interesting to notice is how\nfew men live hands free, with only\n2% of male respondents having some\nquality alone time only a few times a\nyear and almost managing to masturbate less than that (or possibly not at\nall).\nBut what of the girls, you ask? Well it\nseems that the ladies lead more ful\ufb01lling lives with less boredom, leading to\nonly 3% of females saying they masturbate daily and 17.5% taking themselves\nto task a few times a week. Combining\nthe results we see that 39.7% of women\nat Imperial masturbate at least once a\nweek, in other words less than half of\nthe male equivalent.\nIn contrast to their male counterparts 25% of female survey respondents take part in self-grati\ufb01cation less\nthan a few times a year or not at all. A\nlack of availability to comment on this\nsection means that we can only speculate whether this is because of di\ufb00erences in sexuality, lifestyles or just less\nboredom!\nPeople who choose not to identify as\nmale or female formed a much smaller\nnumber of respondents, so the data is\nnot as reliable. However of this group\n33% did not wish to divulge their masturbation habits, while 20% claimed a\ndaily self-devotion.\nBy department, well, it seems Civil\nEngineering are the biggest wankers.\nThey nearly reached 30% masturbating daily. When you next go to shake\nhands with the person designing a\nbuilding, perhaps think twice about\nit. ESE masturbated the least, possibly\nbecause they are all in relationships\nwith each other (see analysis of rela-tionships).\nWhen it came to watching porn, it\nwas a clear split. 68% of men watch\nporn weekly, whereas only 11% of\nwomen did. By department, Materials\n\u201cI once gave\nhead in the\nphone box on\nPrince Consort\nRoad dressed\nas an ooma\nloompa\u201c\n\u201cThreesomes\nshould me\nmore widely\navailable.\u201d\n\u201cImperial\ndefinitely isn\u2019t\nfull of sexless\ngeeks - I think\nit\u2019s one of the\nhealthier universities of\nLondon from\nwhat I\u2019ve\nheard - both\nfrom Imperial and out-side-Imperial\nfriends.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Daily\u2019 is the\nhighest available frequency for porn/\nmasturbation?\u201d\n\u201cI have had\nsex in trafalgar square.\u201d\n18% are finding places on campus to get jiggy with it. Some of\nyou seem far too keen to avoid\nbeds. Felix isn\u2019t aware of any kind\nof housing crisis, so why 19 of you\nhave had to have sex in Reynold\u2019s\nBar is a mystery. It\u2019s the very public locations that confuse us. How\nhave 18 of you had sex in Ethos\u2019\nPool? We don\u2019t want to know ac-tually. Blackett is the most popular department building, 29 of you\nhave been at it there. Frankly, we\nall want to stop thinking about\n100\n50\n200\n150\n250\nNo\nof\nrespondents\nRestraints Vibrators Dildos\nIt seems that threesomes are a lot less\ncommon that you might have heard.\nJust 9% of all survey respondents\nclaim to have taken part in a three-some, with the number of these students from Biomedical Engineering\nand Chemical Engineering not being\nhigh enough to have their own internal departmental threesomes. Surprisingly Materials comes out on top as the\nmost adventurous (no pun intended),\nwith a whopping 24% of Materials respondents claiming to have taken part\nin a threesome. While this might seem\nwild, we have to, as always, consider\nthe possible skew these results contain\ndue to the people most likely to take\npart. Then again who knows, it might\nbe worth popping your head in at the\nRoyal School of Mines. Second place\nis reserved for EEE who scored 16%\nwhile Mech Eng came third with 13%.\nWhat does it take to have a three-some? Probably guts, alcohol and\nan inquisitive nature. This of course\ndoesn\u2019t mean you are any more or less\nofapersonfortakingpartinabedroom\nsituation with multiple partners. After\nall some people have\ndi\ufb00erent opinions\non threesomes and\nthey don\u2019t always\nend happily. As well\nas the possibility of\nbeing an exciting,\nsweaty experience\nthat leaves you smil-ing, a threesome can\nalso be emotionally\ndamaging especially\nif there is a friendship or relationship\ninvolved.\nAdding numbers\nto the mix almost\n12% of Imperial\nmales have been involved with a threesome in comparison to just under 7%\nof females which might shine a light\non how a signi\ufb01cant number of Imperial threesomes are split by gender.\nHowever apparently 23.5% of men\nand 35.5% of women have been asked\nfor a threesome, while 20.5% of males\nand 10% of females have been the ones\nasking. So it seems that guys at Imperial are much more keen on the idea of\nno\nof\nrespondents\nYes\nNo\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\nEver had a threesome Ever asked Ever been asked\nThreesomes\nthreesomes than their female counter-parts.

It seems that a lot of you are\nconfusing your life for an episode\nof Skins by having sex in a park.\nAn impressive number managed\nto do the deed on the street. The\nother locations that were given\nwere certainly impressive to say\nthe least. The Tube!? That\u2019s just\nconfusing, some commuters and\ntourists must have been treated to\na more eventful journey then they\nplanned.\nSex around London\n*Sorry we forgot Chem Eng\nUnion Minibuses\n(erm, eww)\nare watching the most porn, but aren\u2019t\nmasturbating the most... Interesting.\nOne interesting thing came up. If\nyou masturbate a lot of are also likely\nto be unhappy with your sex life. If you\nmasturbate a few times a week or less\nyou are 15% more likely to be unhappy\nwith your sex life than people masturbating weekly or more. So perhaps\nmasturbating regularly is an indicator\nthat you are unhappy with your sex life.\ngive her sex life an A* rating, buy a sex\ntoy maybe?\nThe majority of you that have sex\ntoys own vibrators, which perhaps\nmeans that Imperial students are so\nbusy that when they want to spice up\nthings in the bedroom (alone or with\na partner) they want it done for them.\n205 people said they had a vibrator,\ncompared to the 105 who had a dildo.\nFinally, we would like to advise one\nrespondent that \u201cputting a hamster up\n[your] bum\u201d does not count as a sex\ntoy, and is certainly not safe.\nDressup is mainly reserved for\nDramSoc and Musical Theatre it\nseems. A sole one person said they\ndressed up \u201call of the time\u201d and another one person said they dressed up\n\u201cmost of the time\u201d. Presumably, most\nof that was with the person walking\naround in a gimp suit 24/7.\n\u201cI thought this survey\nwould encapsulate broader\nattitudes towards sex, and\nnot assume one is taking part\nin sexual activity. There are\nmany others in my position\nwho are saving sex for a\nlong-lasting and loving\nrelationship. A chance to\nshare intimacy and something\nvery special with one person.\nWithin marriage... Cultural/\nreligious reasons don\u2019t\n\u201caffect\u201d my sex life. I look\nforward to great sex from my\nwedding night and beyond.\nNo baggage!!\u201d\n\u201cHad sex in St. James\u2019 park\nduring the summer, after\ndark, while beach volley\nball was going on in Horse\nGuards Parade.\u201d\n\u201cGreat Hall, on the stage,\ntry it someday.\u201d\n\u201cWe had sex in the\nchanging rooms in REISS on\nOxford Street.\u201d\n\u201cDid this [Felix Sex Survey]\nin the library.

Well that\u2019s a couple\nof puns out of the way, so\nI guess we can get onto\nmore serious(ish) stuff.\nWe have the pretty infographics for\nyou to look at, as well as plenty of anal-ysis. Hope you enjoy it! Flip to page 8\nand go testicles, sorry, nuts.\nThere are some very interesting\nthings to pick out of the survey. This\nsmall X-Rated picture paints quite\na few words, and has some surpris-ing, and less surprising, results. For\nstudents that remember the previous\nincarnations: don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s all\nthe stuff you want to see like which\nDepartment are the biggest wankers.\nLet\u2019s be clear on a few things: this is\na bit of a tongue in cheek look into the\nsex lives of Imperial students. It\u2019s by no\nmeans going to be 100% accurate, but\nit definitely has its merits and there are\na lot of interesting things to read. The\ndata analysis has been a long process,\ninvolving a lot of organising and a lot\nof information. Publishing the results\nhad to be delayed to allow us enough\ntime to look through everything. There\nis no possible way that we can go\nthrough everything and 100% analyse\nthe results to perfection: we are, after\nall, a small student newspaper, and\ndon\u2019t have the resources to go through\nit all in perfect detail. If you spot something we missed out or messed up, let\nus know, and we can correct it for next\nyear. We know we\u2019ll probably mess up\nthe wording here are there.\nThere are also plenty of questions\nwe could have asked. We wanted to\nlimit it to not make it too laborious to\nfill out and analyse: this was in the\nhope that people wouldn\u2019t get bored\nhalf way through completing it and\nnot bother to finish it off. So sometimes we only touched on a subject\nbriefly. Maybe next year some topics\nthat people found interesting can be\nexplored out in more detail.\nThere were a lot of responses and\nnot too many trolls, well, not many\nobvious trolls. This does bring up the\nserious point: people lie on surveys.\nThey really do. Every single survey\never done in the history of the world\nwill have people lying. Therefore there\nis always the worry that people are fib-bing. Obviously, the best we can really\ndo about this is just ignore them and/\nor point out odd trends.\nThe British are known for our slight\nshyness. It seems it is not a reputation\nwe fully deserve, but the results still\nspat out some interesting conclusions\nfor us to swallow. One that springs to\nmind under the pressure of a deadline\nrumbling towards me is the responses\nwe received for the question about\nonline dating. We all thought a lot of\npeople would say they have tried it,\nbut it didn\u2019t seem so. Whether this is\ntrue or people are (sensually) massaging the truth due to embarrassment or\nsome perceived social stigma is up to\nyou \u2013 although we quickly investigated it (page 10). People did seem fairly\nwilling to try it out though. There were\nmany more interesting observations to\nbe made, but I don\u2019t have the space to\ntalk about them in the three columns I\nhave here.\nWe took data protection seriously.\nAt no point could we find out who you\nwere. All we looked at when analysing\nthe results was just the replies: it just\nshowed the responses that you gave\nin an Excel document, it didn\u2019t show\nwho gave what. After the analysis was\ndone, the data was deleted. For more\ninformation on this, email felix@impe-rial.ac.uk.\nA big personal thanks to all of the\npeople that helped with analysis!\nFinally, a gigantic thank you to all\nof the respondents. We couldn\u2019t have\ndone this without you. Well, we could\nhave I guess, but it would just be self\nstimulation, which, apparently, a lot\nof you like...

Kurt Vile\nhad not brought a backing band\nalong on this occasion and he made\neveryone wait. The crowds were a\nbunch of happy campers though \u2013\ntrue to the stoner spirit. They did\nnot mind one bit as Vile spent some\ntime tuning his guitar on stage and\nrepeatedly asked his sound engineer\nfor \u201cmore reverb, yeaa!\u201d\nHailing from Philadelphia, Vile\nwas initially a part of The War on\nDrugs which was followed by constant touring with his backing band\nThe Violators. His writings come\nacross as incoherent, yet purposefully poetic and although he lands\nhis words in a leisurely way, boy, do\nMonday,Tuesday,HappyDaze\nMo Mirza getswithintouchingdistanceofKurtVileinCamden\nthey pack a punch. Vile\u2019s songs are\nunhurried and spacious and have\nuncanny knack for conveying his\ndeep meanderings.\nI found his previous album Smoke\nRing for My Halo absolutely superb\nand the appearance of a few choice\nsongs, such as the blissful \u2018Jesus Fever\u2019 and loving \u2018Baby\u2019s Arms\u2019, made\nmy night. One admirable thing to\nnote about Kurt Vile is that even\nthough he comes across as overt\nabout religion, it never really becomes annoying. He somehow manages to sing his praises, and not detract from the musical experience\n\u2013 that is pretty rare.\nOnce tuned to perfection, Vile\u2019s\nguitar squeaked awake as he shared\nhis stoner wisdom with \u2018Wakin\u2019 on a\nPretty Day\u2019, a song from his fifth latest studio album Wakin on a Pretty\nT\nDaze. \u201cPhone ringing off the shelf\u2026\n\u201d he sang, epitomizing his laid-back\nnature.\nHe continued on to play some\nmore people pleasers which lulled\nthe crowd into a pretty daze. A kind\nof seduction by soothing is how one\ncould describe it. \u2018Peeping Tomboy\u2019,\nalso from Smoke Ring for My Halo,\ncame across as a crowd favourite\nwith quite a few happy campers\nchiming in to Vile\u2019s dulcet tones.\nWith no backing band most of\nwhat Kurt plays has a more subtle\nand easy going feel to it than what\nyou hear in the album versions. Perhaps this is what he intended. In\nVile\u2019s head, there is all the time in\nthe world and no need for rushin\u2019\nand the crowd acknowledged that.\nLike most geniuses Kurt\u2019s mutter-ings are very erratic, some of them\nincredible and some not so. His live\nperformances are, however, undoubtedly exceptional and I am totally looking forward to seeing him\nrock out once more at the Field Day\nfestival tomorrow. Yeaa!\nAMS album of the week\nEnsemble Pearl is a thoroughly dark\nalbum featuring some big names in\nmodern avant-garde metal. Steve\nO\u2019Malley of Sunn O))) is the best\nknown, but two members of Boris,\nthe Japanese noise rock band, are\nalso present (drummer Atsuo and\nlive guitarist Michio Kurihara). Former bassist of Jesse Sykes & the\nSweet Hereafter, Bill Herzog, is the\nonly musician that might seem out of\nplace.\nThe four of them set out to make a careful masterpiece of ominous music\nlike nothing they\u2019ve written before. This is saying a lot, as O\u2019Malley and Boris\u2019 music has touched upon everything heavy and unholy. Ensemble Pearl is\ninstead a collection of slow, doomy instrumentals, fleshed out with gloomy\ntextures. Drums keep a steady dirge pace yet feel loose and improvisational.\nMelodies and riffs take minutes to play out and run their course through\nmoods both dark and ambiguous. The mix never becomes muddied by an\noverdose of pedals or laptop effects. Dissonance is not constant, such that\nthe listener is not exhausted by offensive sounds, but this does not stop Kurihara occasionally lashing out with incredibly loud, fuzzed guitar solos that\nthe rest of the band are unshaken by.\nTracks average 8-10 minutes with the final chapter, \u201cSexy Angle\u201d, playing\nfor a monumental 20 minutes, climaxing in a solo at its 13th\nminute that could\nbe mistaken for a small child, screaming. In the song\u2019s quieter moments, an\nassortment of drones rise up from the background, and individual snares and\ntoms are delayed separately from the rest of the drum kit, making the band\nfeel like much more than four players.\nSome of the album\u2019s best parts are those where the atmosphere surfaces\nfrom its darkest moments. The best example of this is \u201cWray\u201d, a beatless track\nfocused on string drones and heavily sampled koto plucks, evoking a differ-ent, lighter mood, becoming almost ambient. A casual listener might fault\nthe album on being too consistent, or simply be disappointed that the result\nisn\u2019t \u201cheavy\u201d enough, given the talent present. It\u2019s simply heavy in a different\nmanner \u2013 a slow, suffocating manner, rather than the blistering noise that Boris and Sunn O))) have been treating our ears with for years.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\n14\nHorizing to the challenge\nIt\u2019s drawing to the end of another year\nat Imperial. Everyone has some kind\nof big deadline looming, except for the\nlucky few that \ufb01nish early. It\u2019s around\nthis time that extra curricular activities su\ufb00er. If you go to level 4 of the\nLibrary and suggest to someone that\nthey do work for something that will\ngive them precisely zero marks, then\nyou\u2019re risking a punch in the face.\nThat\u2019s what Imperial Horizons has\nbeen doing this year, and it\u2019s been\nsurprisingly e\ufb00ective. Reasons for this\ncould be everything from students\nwanting to learn a new skill to the\nmore cynical CV padding. Although,\nthe idea that an employer would be\nshaking with excitement at seeing that\nyou did an extra course at university is\na bit strange. Either way, people have\nbeen doing these courses. Next year\nsome Departments will let students\ndo these courses for credit. Mainly it\nseems that students are enjoying the\ncourses and doing them as a way to\nbreak out of the science and engineering world, or perhaps just take on a\nnew challenge. Plus, it\u2019s a good way to\nmeet some new people.\nThe \ufb01rst thing to address is the\nname. The pun department weren\u2019t\nexactly on overdrive when they \ufb01shed\nit out. We get it. Expanding our hori-zons. Har har. Anyway, more impor-tantly, what did people think of the\ncourses?\nSOLE feedback shows that 80% of\npeople think that the structure and\ndelivery of the teaching was either\ngood or very good. This is a fact that\nthe Horizons team say they are particularly proud of. In fact, nobody said\nthat the teaching was very poor and\nonly 2% considered it to be poor. The\nmajority actually rated it as very good.\nAt Imperial, where almost everyone\nis a scathing critic of teaching, this is\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief certainly impressive.\nThe content is a similar story. Again,\nvery good and good dominated the\nbar chart: 72% said the content of the\ncourse was desirable.\nLloyd Fung, who took the Energy\nand Climate Change course, said that\nhe took the option as he was \u201cvery\ninterested in related technology\u201d. He\nsaid that it did not get in the way of his\nother studies and that he would like to\ndo a follow up course, if possible. His\nfavourite part of the course was that\ndi\ufb00erent perspectives were given on\nan issue. He said it gave him a \u201cwider\nperspective\u201d as opposed to \u201clooking\n[at] it as a scientist or engineer\u201d.\nShiladitya Ghosh did his Engineers\nWithout Borders Global Challenges\ncourse as he \u201cwas really keen to learn\nabout the holistic implementation of\nengineering design in the real world\nout there\u201d. He enjoyed the course but\nwould want a new challenge and to try\nsomething di\ufb00erent next year, possibly\nMandarin or German. Shiladitya admitted that the work got in the way of\nsome other submissions at the end of\nspring, but said: \u201cI have lived to tell the\ntale\u2026 at the end day, it\u2019s due to such\nstress that I felt I really got something\nout of the course as well.\u201d\nArijit Gupta\u2019s favourite part of his\nIntroduction to Mandarin course was\nlearning his \ufb01rst Chinese symbols. It\ndidn\u2019t get in the way of his other stud-ies, and he said it was \u201ca nice change\nfrom maths\u201d. He is already planning to\ntake the next Mandarin course.\nOn-line enrolment for current 1st year undergraduates entering\ntheir 2nd year in October 2013 is now open.\nFind out more:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/horizons\nMake sure you enrol by 2.00pm Thursday 6th June 2013\nIMPERIAL HORIZONS 2013/14\nLeft to right: Shiladitya Ghosh and Arijit Gupta \u2013 both took courses this year\n\n"

Budd\n\u201cTea is instant wisdom \u2013\njust add water\u201d \u2013 A. Alauda\nMy most recent experiment involved a very ancient tradition. One\nthat is the same in Chinese as in Persian, Urdu or Dari. The word is \u2018chai\u2019\nNow, such research is not because\npuny e\ufb00orts at lifting \ufb02oating weights\nin aqua aerobics has not done much\nfor the strength of the mind, and neither have countless tests. This investigation is because of a solid attempt to\nactually investigate the link between\ntea, meditation and life.\nTea is a way of life. No joke. In some\ncultures, drinking tea is the most wonderful way to relax. You have your pot\nof hot water, tea leaves, honey and\ncup, and for a few moments drinking\n\ufb02avoured hot water and \u2018being\u2019 is a\nspecial moment.\nSo how does this link to meditation?\nThe way of the tea is the link. The art\nof making it and mastering the minti-ness, honey and tea (for example not\never adding cold water). When you\nfocus on the cup and tea, emptying\nyour mind. Feeling numb. You\u2019ll pretty\nmuch be reaching Nirvana. Soon.\nTo say it was a bit of a surprise to\ndiscover that there was Echinacea\ntea, lemongrass to even lavender tea,\nwould be an understatement. My narrow world had been shown some light.\nAfter mixing many teas, and actually\nfeeling unwell prior to this, I stumbled\nupon the right mix of mint leaves, car-damoms, lemongrass and ginger tea.\nI\nSurprisingly, it was curing. Nowadays\nI have an obsession with teas, I think,\nwhich would totally contradict that\nwith trees. This is because of incorrect meditative practice. The point of\nmeditation isn\u2019t to focus on a object\n(or a \ufb02ickering candle), but actually\nfeel at peace.\nTea makes you strong and healthy,\nwithout any of the arti\ufb01cialities or\n\ufb01ckle synthesis. Just the way mother\nnature intended. From leaf to clay. In\nharmony.\nIt is a part of our daily lives, what if\nwe actually questioned and thought\nabout the \u2018why\u2019. Why the tradition of\ntea. In a world where modern utopia\nis on the surface overtaking zeitgeist,\nthe core remains entrenched in\ntradition. Chai matters.\nFor tea, over which many\nhumourous observations\nand re\ufb02ections were made.\nI hope the link between\ntea, meditation and life\nis unclear. Because\nin life, you\u2019ve got to\nmaster your own\nmind in meditation over tea,\ninstead of\nlistening to\na lost cause\nramble on.\n\u201d\nTea is a way\nof life. No\njoke. In some\ncultures,\ndrinking tea\nis the most\nwonderful\nway to relax\nTea: A taste of harmony\n21\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\nI still cherish the memory of the \ufb01rst\nmeeting of the IC Heads of Departments I attended \u2013 it was both\neducational and amusing.. Having\nreceived the invitation, my predecessor immediately tried to dissuade me\nfrom accepting it; nobody expected the\nLibrarian to discuss College business,\nshamefully I would be the odd one out\namong the Heads.\nNaturally, I immediately decided to\ngo, taking the risk to be the odd one out,\nnot on account of being the Librarian\nbut being the only woman on the list\nof participants. The Rector, Eric Ash,\nwas the \ufb01rst person to realize this,\nvaliantly rising to the challenge: after\nrapping his gavel and emitting a stentorian cry: \u201cGentlemen\u201d, he looked at\nFarewell to HOST\nme and added \u201cand Magda\u201d. The discussion included, as almost always,\nthe \ufb01nancial prospects of the College;\nhow much income the departments\nwere expected to earn, and how the\ndepartments which did not bring in\nsu\ufb03cient money would be supported.\nThe Library was always a special case\nbecause of the disproportionately high\ncost of scienti\ufb01c journals, but everyone\naround the table agreed that journals\nwere the life-blood of research and that\ntheir subscription must continue.\nWe also debated the position of\nHOST (History of Science and Technology), the relatively modest cost of\nmaintaining three to four members\nof sta\ufb00 teaching and undertaking research which was acknowledged as\noutstanding and seamlessly \ufb01tting into\nthe high academic standard of the College. To my amazement and delight,\nthe Heads of the major, internationally respected departments stood up,\none after the other and declared their\nsupport for HOST. They \ufb01rmly stated\nthat current achievements in science\nhad been built on the foundation laid\nby our predecessors. That there is a\ncontinuity of scienti\ufb01c discoveries, and\nthat the past belongs to us, it is therefore our duty to keep its memory alive.\nWhat better way to do that than to\nmaintain HOST? I felt that I was witnessing something unique: the declaration of solidarity of scientists both past\nand present.\nIt was, therefore, with great sadness\nthat I have learned of the transfer of\nHOST to King\u2019s College London. I am\nsure that there must have been a serious debate in College regarding the\ndecision and it is not my intension to\nquestion why this had to happen. The\nmemory of that Heads of Departments\nmeeting, however, will stay with me\nforever, the image of a magnanimous\nCollege \ufb01rmly believing in \u201cone culture\u201d \u2013 science and arts combined \u2013\nwhich few institutions were ever able\nto demonstrate. What remains now is\nto say farewell to HOST, wishing it a\nhappy and prosperous future \u2013 alas, in\nanother institution.\nMagda Czig\u00e1ny\nLibrarian 1986-2000\nFellow of the College 2002\nLetters\nfelixonline.co.uk/contact\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\nWikipedia\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\nollar Babies\n12. Iron Man 3\nWorldwide gross: $1,035,973,000\nWhy? It hasn\u2019t even been a full month\nsince its release, and yet here sits\nTony Stark\u2019s third outing, proudly at\nnumber 13 in the highest worldwide\ngrossing \ufb01lms of all time. You can\nexpect the \ufb01lm to climb up several\nspots at the end of this summer. Stark\n(played by the irreplaceable Robert\nDowney Jr.) is without a doubt\nthe most popular character of the\nMarvel Universe, and given the great\nbig success of Avengers Assemble,\nimmediately following that record-breaker no doubt helped boost the\noverall numbers. It\u2019s raking in money\nfrom China ($64 million + opening\nweekend \u2013 highest ever), after a\nspecial-cut featuring local actors and\nscenes appear to be going down well\nwith audiences there.\n11. Pirates of the\nCaribbean: On Stranger\nTides\nWorldwide gross: $1,043,871,802\nWhy? After the dud that was At\nWorld\u2019s End where very little made\nsense, Disney commissioned another\nouting for Captain Jack Sparrow\n(Johnny Depp \u2013 always the reliable\nblockbuster box office draw),\nretaining very few of its original\ncharacters (Geoffrey Rush stayed on\n\u2013 hurrah). Business in the States was\ndisappointing to say the least, falling\nmassively short of its predecessors,\nbut it\u2019s the international market\nthat contributed to $800 million\nof its total gross. Italy poured in an\nimpressive $108 million into the \ufb01nal\ncount, with the next highest coming\nfrom China with $70 million.\n10. Toy Story 3\nWorldwide gross: $1,063,171,911\nWhy? Dubbed as a \ufb01lm that would\nmake even grown men cry, this was\none of the best reviewed \ufb01lms of\n2010 (Rottentomatoes places a 99%\nfresh rating), as well as the highest\ngrossing \ufb01lm of 2010 (both in the\nStates and internationally). The kids\nloved it, and frankly, so did the adults,\nwith many young adults reminiscing\nthe days they watched their \ufb01rst two\nToy Story \ufb01lms as children back in the\n90s. Everyone loves and trusts Pixar\nto come up with something witty and\nheart-warming time and time again.\nAlso bene\ufb01tting from the 3D push,\nit had very little competition (if at\nall) in its \ufb01rst two weeks (Jonah Hex,\nGrown Ups, Knight & Day), in which\nthe \ufb01lm generated $250 million in the\nStates alone.\n9. Pirates of the\nCaribbean: Dead Man\u2019s\nChest\nWorldwide gross: $1,066,179,725\nWhy? The Curse of the Black Pearl\nwas such a huge hit that greenlighting\nsequels couldn\u2019t have been a difficult\ndecision \u2013 and with the full cast on\nboard, only success was in store\nfor this immediate sequel. Its 2006\nopening numbers, $135 million, was a\nrecord-setter, smashing Spider-man\u2019s\n4-year reign at that point. It ruled the\ntop for three straight weeks, and was\nthe fastest \ufb01lm to earn $100 million,\n$200 million and $300 million back\nin 2006 (all these records have since\nbeen smashed but for a non-3D, non-superhero themed picture, this was\nquite an achievement seven years\nago).\n3. Avengers Assemble\nWorldwide gross: $1,511,757,910\nWhy? Raking in $207 million, this\nholds the record for the best North\nAmerican opening. Ever since the \ufb01rst\ncouple of Iron Man \ufb01lms convinced\nMarvel to pursue something bigger\nand bolder, every \ufb01lm before\nAvengers Assemble (Thor, Captain\nAmerica, The Incredible Hulk) has\nbeen hinting at a possible massive\ngroup project. Finally hitting the\nscreens in 2012, Joss Wheon of Buffy/\nAngel/Firefly fame certainly did not\ndisappoint. Undoubtedly the biggest\nmovie event of 2012, a long list of\nrecords were smashed, although\nit didn\u2019t fly as high as some were\nanticipating (i.e. didn\u2019t reach number\n1 internationally). But being number 3\nis still incredible, and with a sequel on\nthe way, perhaps that can aim higher.\n2. Titanic\nWorldwide gross: $2,185,372,302\nWhy? From this point on, we\u2019re\nonly dealing with \ufb01lms that have\ncrossed the TWO billion dollar line.\nOnly two \ufb01lms have done so, both\ndirected by the same man, James\nCameron that show-off. Well, where\nto start with this one \u2013 there was the\nLeo-fever, where women worldwide\ncouldn\u2019t get enough of its leading\nstar, Leonardo DiCaprio, there was\nthat song \u2018My Heart Will Go On\u2019,\nthe tragic love story, plus the \ufb01nal\nspectacular hour of where the ship\nsinks, killing a whole load of people\nalong with it. This holds the record\nfor spending the most number of\nconsecutive weeks (15) at the number\none spot in the North American box\noffice, and even in its 3D re-release,\npeople loved it \u2013 15 years on.\n1. Avatar\nWorldwide gross: $2,782,275,172\nWhy? It\u2019s the same pattern with\nJames Cameron \u2013 there is a lot of talk\nsurrounding his new project, because\nit\u2019s so ambitious. A trailer is released,\neveryone hates it and guarantees that\nhis latest big-budget epic will tank\nseverely and won\u2019t make any money.\nAndyetoncereleased,he\u2019sthekingof\nthe world. (Unadjusted for inflation),\nno \ufb01lm in the history of Hollywood\nhas crossed $700 million in America,\nand neither has foreign gross crossed\n$2 billion, until Cameron came along\nwith his blue Na\u2019vis and took over\nthe 2009 Christmas season with his\nnew \ufb01lm. Despite stiff competition\nfrom Sherlock Holmes and Alvin and\nthe Chipmunks, audiences just could\nnot be kept away from what would\nbecome the biggest \ufb01lm of all time.\n8. The Dark Knight\nRises\nWorldwide gross: $1,084,439,099\nWhy?

    "content": "11\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\n10 FRIDAY 24 MAY\nSEXUAL SATISFACTION\nIs Imperial really as limp\nas it seems?\nONLINE\nWith Imperial students having more\ncompassionate relationships with\ntheir laptops than they do with their\nlab partners, only a surprisingly low\n4% (39 people) admitted to using online dating websites. However, it does\nseem that some of you out there could\nbe convinced, with 29% admitting to\nconsidering it in the future if it does\nappear rather bleak. It may be no time\nbefore people are uploading and refreshing over weeping and wanking.\nRELATIONSHIPS\nJust how shy are we all around those\nwe have a soft spot for? With 56% of\ngirls being in a relationship at the mo-ment, compared to 49% of the males\nout there, woman are slightly taking\nthe lead when it comes to romance.\nBut how many people out there are\ngetting down and dirty within the\nvery social con\ufb01nes of Imperial? 51%\nof those in a relationship are dating\nsomeone else with Central library ac-cess, meaning that the other half are\ngoing elsewhere to get their teenage\nkicks right through the night.\nSo with one half getting their nerd-gasm on in between lectures and labs,\nare those dating fellow Imperial students faring any better? 93% of those\nconsider themselves happy or even\nvery happy, whereas a smaller 88% of\nthose indulging o\ufb00 campus coitus can\nsay the same. Making love in lab coats\nmay therefore have its perks.\nSo if you want in on this Imperial in-fatuation, where should you start your\nsearch? 33% of those dating someone at Imperial found their squeeze\nin halls, with about 20% \ufb01nding their\nsigni\ufb01cant other at a club or society\nor dating someone from their course.\nAt either Union or non-Union parties\ntrailed behind. Perhaps missing that\nnight out to look over your notes and\ncolour co-ordinate it by subject wasn\u2019t\nsuch a terrible shout after all then.\nAre hall seniors therefore rising to\nthe challenge, going above and beyond\ntheir role? 91 people have experienced\ntheir hall senior trying it on, whereas\n52 people succumbed to their authoritative advances and been given more\nthan the average pastoral care. This\ngives hall seniors a hit rate of around\n1 in 2: something for Wardens to worry about, and something for socially\nawkward \ufb01rst years to aspire towards.\nWhat about Departments? Well, the\nmost incestuous were the ESE (Earth\nSciences and Engineering) people.\n22% of them are in relationships with\neach other. That\u2019s a staggering 44%\nof the department. They stood head\nand shoulders above the others. Next\nup were humanities as the others just\naren\u2019t alternative enough for them.\nMaterials were very low though, so\nthere\u2019s at least one building on campus\nthat\u2019s bound to be awkward. Computing, well, maybe you should close your\nmonitors and look at the people in\nyour lecture theatre: below 5% are in a\nrelationship with each other.\nAt the same time as them all being\nlovey dovey with each other 20% of\nESE are not happy. Awkward.\nSo it seems at Imperial a lot of people aren\u2019t doing too badly when it\ncomes to \ufb01nding that special some-one. However, don\u2019t feel that this may\nhinder your chances as a singleton, as\nwith one comment stating, \u201cover half\nthe guys I\u2019ve slept with have had girlfriends,\u201d faithfulness may not be at the\ntop of some of the men\u2019s agendas. This\nis de\ufb01nitely something that needs to\nbe addressed in the next Sex Survey\u2026\nHow many scientists are\nsampling each other?\nORAL AND ANAL\nWho\u2019s getting on their knees? Well,\nprobably most of you. 82% were happy to give oral, and 85% were happy\nto receive oral. When you go down to\nthe gender split, 5% more men were\nhappy to give head. The most stunning di\ufb00erence was in the answers\nfor happy to receive oral. 77% of\nwomen and an amazing 91% of men\nwere happy to get head. It seems the\n\ufb02avoured condom need a massive ad\ncampaign, as nobody is using them.\nPerhaps it\u2019s the \ufb02avours? 87% of people who give/receive oral sex are using protection.\nHow about anal sex? Well, 32%\nsaid that they had had anal sex. 24%\nof people said that they had at one\npoint asked for anal sex. The gender\nsplit for this was pronounced. 11%\nof women and 32% of men said that\nthey had asked. In total, 30% said\nthat they had been asked for anal sex.\nPerhaps you\u2019re all asking each other?\nWho knows. Anyway, breaking that\ndown by gender and you \ufb01nd that\nthe result corresponds to the people\nasking pretty well. 24% of men and\n38% of women said they had been approached about anal sex.\nOf the people that had had anal sex,\n63% of them had asked. Don\u2019t ask\ndon\u2019t get applies then it seems. Although 69% had also been asked. 84%\nwho hadn\u2019t had anal sex had not been\nasked for it.\nSo, with our infamous ratio often being quoted as a source of a lot of dis-content, are we really as dissatis\ufb01ed as\nother student surveys are leading us\nto believe?\nWhen asking students about how\nhappy they are with their sex life, the\nmajority of students said they were\nsatis\ufb01ed with their sex life, with 61%\neither happy or very happy in their\nbedroom endeavours. Only 15% of\nstudents said they were dissatis\ufb01ed\nwith their lacklustre sex lives.\nSplitting by gender though, 67% of\nall females out there are either happy\nor very happy. This is not the case for\nthe boys, with only 55% of men feeling\nthe same. One in four males simply\ndescribed their attitude to their sex\nlife as \u201cmeh.\u201d\nSo has Imperial had any in\ufb02uence on these \ufb01ndings? When asked,\naround 46% of students overall feel\nthat being at Imperial negatively affects your sex life. However, when\nsplit by gender, it was found that, ac-tually, to the contrary, 20% of women\nthought it enhanced their sex lives,\ncompared to only 9% of men thinking\nthe same. Not only that, a further 56%\nof males agreed that going to Imperial\nhas left them rather high and forever\ndry by stating Imperial has done them\nno sexual favours.\nJust to cover all of the bases, we\nthen asked if their sex life at Imperial\nhas had any impact on their overall\nstudent satisfaction. It was also found\nthat 59% of students thought that\nthere wasn\u2019t really any link between\nthe two. Splitting by gender again,\nit does seem that the boys are again\nmore disgruntled than the girls, with\n64% of females not considering their\nsex lives a hindrance to their blossoming student experience, whilst\nonly 56% of the boys seem to think\nthe same. Maybe what the library can\ndo for some it just can\u2019t do for others.\nWith women on average having\nmore sex per week then men, it does\nseem that men are indeed feeling a bit\nbegrudged towards the ratio. However, generally, the majority of students\nshouldn\u2019t seem to have a hard time\nswallowing the fact that we are, gen-erally, quite a sexually satis\ufb01ed bunch.\nFor departments, 26% of Maths students declare themselves \u201cUnhappy\nwith their sex life.\u201d They should head\nover to EEE where it drops to just 5%.\nIs EEE the hive of Imperial\u2019s sex life?\n43% of them have sex \u201cMonthly or\nLess\u201d so perhaps it is.\nWhat about those hard core fuckers\nout there who ticked the \u2018daily\u2019 box\nwhen asked how often they had? How\nhappy are they? 76% of them declare\nthemselves Very Happy. No surprises.\nSo next time someone publically\nberates the Imperial social scene and\nthe lack of stimulation it may provide,\nit is probable that they are actually\nbumping uglys behind closed doors\n(or even in that toilet upstairs in the\nUnion)\u2026 unless they are male.\nAre students logging on\nor jacking off?\nDespite the obvious decline in the\nnumber of virgins over the years as\nmore of the na\u00efve \ufb01rst years get around\nto popping their cherry, just how many\nFreshers are virgins when the arrive?\nThe split between the age that females and males are losing their virginity at is evident. With 27% of females losing their virginity at the age of\nthe 18 compared to only 18% of males,\nit seems that they will be more experienced than their male counterparts.\nThere is also a signi\ufb01cant drop between the ages of 18 and 19 as ages for\nvirginity loss \u2013 with only 12% of girls\nholding out for that extra year and 11%\nof boys doing the same, this may be\nin\ufb02uenced by the transition to univer-sity, and also halls providing that amorous atmosphere we all know and love.\nThis year alone saw a \ufb02urry of activity within the fresher community: 28%\nof the females who started this year\nlost their virginity aged 18, with only\n18% of those who are male doing the\nsame. Even after allowing for corrections for those who may have started\nuniversity at a later age and those that\nmaybe lost their virginity before uni-versity, it still shows a signi\ufb01cant discrepancy between the two genders \u2013\nthe men are seemingly more likely to\nbe virgins than the women throughout\nthis \ufb01rst year.\nIt seems that some virgins at ImVIRGINITY\nJust how fresh are the freshers?\nperial traverse their maiden voyage\nwithin the con\ufb01nes of halls, and even,\npossibly, at the hands of the trusty hall\nsenior. Those who lost their virginity\nat the ages of 18 and 19 also saw 7%\nand 5% of them respectively having\nsex with their hall senior too, although\nsuch a correlation drawn can be seen\nas rather tenuous. It does remain a\npossibility, however, that 1 in 20 of students were de\ufb02owered by that impressively experienced second year student\non your corridor.\nSo if it is not the tender hands and\nwords of a hall senior, what else in\ufb02uences students in losing their V plates?\nWhen asked whether beliefs have an\nin\ufb02uence on their sex life, 37% of people who stated that they are virgins\nalso said religion has in\ufb02uenced their\nchoices sexually. This suggests that\nperhaps many are choosing to remain\nvirgins as opposed to wanting to lose\ntheir virginity but not being able to.\nWhen it came to age, most lost it\nat 18. However, a larger number than\nyou may think lost their virginity very\nyoung. 117 people said that they have\nlost their virginity at the age of 15 and\nbelow.\nThe always popular virginity by department saw Medicine at the top of\nthe scale.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 24 MAY 23\n10\n10\nChip Kidd\nFrancis Cugat\nMaurice Sendak\nPaul Bacon\nMichael Gillette\nJosh Kirby\nTerry Pratchett was the best selling author of the nineties. The man who\nput a cover on every one of his books until his death in 2001 was the otherwise relatively obscure artist Josh Kirby. His highly distinctive paintings\nperfectly caught the quirky, caricatured madness of Pratchett\u2019s early Discworld novels.\nWorking in oils, his busy, slightly grotesque depictions of the characters\nin the books perfectly caught the surreal atmosphere of the strange comic-fantasies. Perhaps this is why Kirby was also chosen to design the poster art\nfor Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian.\nThe painting for the first printing of F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s seminal work The Great Gatsby may be one of the few examples\nin history of book covers actually influencing the writing of\nthe book. The highly symbolic illustration features a pair of\nfemale eyes beaming mournfully through a night sky. The\neyes hide reclining nude figures and hover above a bright\nmetropolitan carnival. Fitzergeral maintains that the image\nwas written into the final draft of the book possibly in the\nimage of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg billboard eyes.\nCugat went on to work on art for over 68 Hollywood films\nbut it is for this work, the most widely disseminated cover art\nof the 20th Century.\nPaul Bacon designed over 6500 book covers in his career.\nWith a portfolio of that size one could argue that a big hit\nwas inevitable. Bacon also illustrated for Jack Kerouac and\nJohn Cleever but it was his work for Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch 22\nthis is considered by many to be the most memorable.\nBacon was known for pioneering the \u201cBig Book Look,\u201d characterised by the title and author\u2019s name in large, bold print,\naccompanied by a small conceptual illustration. He would\nwork for around three weeks on each book, saying his skill lay\nin \u201cfinding something that would be a synthesis graphically\nof what the story was about\u201d. His jazz record cover designs\nare also worth a look.\nSometimes a young or unrecognisable designer just happens to hit upon an absolute classic. Michael Gillette\u2019s series of covers for Ian Fleming\u2019s Bond novels\nwas one of those times. The covers were commissioned to celebrate the centenary of Ian Fleming\u2019s birth in 2008.\nEverything is perfect from the bold lines and bright colours to the typography.\nThe images proved extremely popular and were made available as prints and\ntranslated into a variety of languages. They feature delicate, smouldering sexy\nretrotastic representations of the girls in each book. \u201cNone of them are based\non any one person or image, they are archetypes. I wanted a look of seductive\nmurder about them,\u201d he says.\nWhere the Wild Things Are has sold 19 million copies worldwide since its publication in 1956. This extraordinary success marks it as one of the most popular children\u2019s book of\nall time.\nUniquely for this list, the illustration and writing are all the\nwork of one man Maurice Sendak. Sendak includes Disney and\nMozart amongst his influences yet his books were so visually\nstriking these are difficult to justify. The story describes the escape of a small boy into a land populated with strange beasts,\nactually caricatures of his family.\nSendak famously refused to write a sequel, announcing just\nbefore his death in 2012 that this would be \u201cthe most boring idea\nimaginable\u201d.\nMany of the illustrators on this list have sunk into relative\nanonymity. Chip Kidd is certainly not one of these. His flamboyant confidence and marketing acuity have seen him rise\nto the top of Random House\u2019s design team. An early work\nthat cemented his reputation was his design for Michael\nCrichton\u2019s fated publication Jurassic Park.\nThe design was so popular it came to represent the entire\nfranchise that followed, including the three Hollywood films,\nmaking Kidd, we suspect, a very wealthy designer.\nLike many of Kidd\u2019s covers the image is simple, striking and\ncreepy. Kidd himself has said that \u201cI\u2019m very much against the\nidea that the cover will sell the book\u201d.\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n"

Thankfully\nthough to help us out we were joined\nby our not so secret weapon Adam\nSchole\ufb01eld, fresh from playing in the\nOlympics for Team GB. The other\nteams began to worry as they witnessed our class and tenacity playing\nagainst our \ufb01rst opponents Manchester, which ended 10-6 in IC\u2019s favour.\nSaturday night saw the team have a\nrelaxing meal out, whilst resisting the\ntemptation for a night out in Bristol,\npreserving our energy for a tough\nSunday of matches. This however did\nnot stop the supporting girls who had\na great time with ladies\u2019 man Torres.\nSunday was an early start against\nEdinburgh who at \ufb01rst proved resilient but tired quickly, ending in an 8-5\nwin to Imperial. Our last game of the\nround robin semi-\ufb01nals were hosts\nBristol, who were also tournament\nfavourites as last year\u2019s winners of the\ncompetition. A strong \ufb01rst half from\nBristol lead to them having a comfortable lead, until we then had them\n\ufb01gured out, where we began to then\nmake a comeback and reduce their\nlead. However, the comeback was neither strong enough nor quick enough\nand the \ufb01nal score was 8-3 to Bristol.\nBristol\u2019s performance throughout the\nsemi-\ufb01nals proved themselves as the\nteam to beat for the \ufb01nals, with the\nother two quali\ufb01ers from the other\nsemi-\ufb01nal leg, Bath and Durham, not\nlooking that imposing.\nThe Finals were due to be played on\nthe 23/24th of March at Leeds University, which happened to be right in the\nmiddle of England\u2019s freak cold spell.\nCommunication came through on\nFriday morning from the BUCS head\no\ufb03ce that the Water Polo Finals were\nto be cancelled, due to heavy snow\nand treacherous driving conditions.\nHealth and safety rules declared that\nit would be unsafe for any competitors\nto risk travelling into the area, and as\nsuch the Finals were postponed until\nthe 11/12th of May. As many Imperial\nstudents can empathise, this is right\nin the middle of exam season, putting\nus at an immediate disadvantage with\nthe loss of many key players.\nNews was then later received that\nDurham has pulled out completely,\ndue to them being unable to \ufb01eld a\nteam as exams had got the better of\nthem. Great commitment was shown\nfrom Andrea, Nick and Jen Wei, who\nall had exams in the coming few days,\nbut they were able to spare some time\nfor the most important matches ever\nof their Water Polo careers.\nWe left early on Friday evening, arriving in late in Leeds but thankfully\nwith comfy beds and a nice hotel to\nsleep in. As Durham had dropped out\nit left us with only Bath and Bristol to\nbeat and also a guaranteed podium\n\ufb01nish. Our \ufb01rst match of the \ufb01nals\nwere against Bath, which in the end\nproved to be one of the closest games\nwe have played this season, akin to\nthat of the one against Oxford back\nin the preliminary rounds. The \ufb01nal\nscore ended 11-12 to Bath, with their\nwinner being scored in the very last\nminute of the game, an unfortunate\nresult and one which made the Bristol\nmatch even more crucial for Imperial.\nAfter substantial hydration and\nsugar consumption we were ready\nto play our \ufb01nal and most important\ngame of the season. Bristol started\nstrongly putting 4 past us in quick\nsuccession, leaving the team looking\nshocked and confused as to what just\nhappened. Ultimately this set the tone\nfor the \ufb01nal match, with Bristol being the much stronger team \u2013 which\nis to be expected of a team who train\n5 times a week and also compete in\nthe national club league. Their performance was well drilled and almost robotic in a sense, giving them a strong\nadvantage over us who had had a long\nEaster break without training and the\nabsence of a few more key players.\nAfter the match we headed to\nLeeds Union, where Marco was able\nto pull some strings and bag us all\nBBQ tokens meant to be exclusively\nfor Leeds Mech Eng students. Once\nBUCS bronze for Water Polo\nAlex Simpson Sports Writer\nIC Waterpolo make a splash at national championships\nwe had ravaged their meat stocks we\nhastily returned to the pool for the \ufb01nal quarter of the \ufb01nal match and the\nwinning ceremony. Bristol produced\na similar result against Bath, securing\ntheir position as championship cham-pions. Our bronze medals were emphatically presented to us and we then\nheaded back to London. An enjoyable\nminibus journey home was unfortunately marred for one anonymous individual who was the subject of a certain piss in an apple juice bottle prank.\nHe neglected to check the colour and\nsmell of the juice before consumption\nand subsequently drank the piss.\nDespite this we all had a great trip\nto Leeds, and thoroughly enjoyed\nplaying. A special thanks should go\nto Tom BF and el presidente Alex for\ntravelling all the way up with us to\nsupport us, and also to coach Adam\nfor the continual hard work he has\nput in over the season. This remains\nImperial\u2019s best performance ever in\nBUCS Water Polo, surpassing that\nof 4 years ago when we won the 2nd\nDivision Shield competition. We look\nforward to next year where we will\nagain be playing in the top division,\nand hope to surpass this year\u2019s perfor-mance.\n\n"

She\u2019s also a great\nexcuse for Dom (Diesel) and his gang\nto come back into the racing game,\neven though they promised to leave\nthis life behind after the birth of Brian\u2018s (Walker) baby boy.\nTurns out Letty is caught up in\nsome illegal activities with notorious\ninternational criminal Owen Shaw\n(Luke Evans) who is waging \u201cvehicular warfare\u201d against the good guys.\nHe drives a fancy, modi\ufb01ed racing car\nwith a neatly equipped trick of \ufb02ipping over any car that races towards\nhim. And it\u2019s Dom\u2019s job to bring her\nWhat\u2019s this? Katherine Heigl in yet\nanother underwhelming romantic\ncomedy? Amanda Seyfried as yet another googly-eyed bride-to-be? Robert de Niro in yet another brainless\nrole? Diane Keaton as yet another\nneurotic old woman who is unlucky\nin love? Ben Barnes playing yet another charming but empty shell of a\nrole? And is Robin Williams so out of\nwork that he needs to resort to play-back, since she\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d. That f-word\ngets tossed around so much here that\nby the end of it all, you\u2019ll get pretty\nsick of hearing it, especially since it\n\ufb01lls up so many chunks that needlessly slows everything down as a\nwhole.\nWith so many good guys turning\nup to form a united front, it\u2019s the\nmain antagonist who has hardly any\nroom for himself. Evans, although an\ne\ufb00ectively smooth-talking baddie,\nnever has the chance to \ufb02ourish. As a\nformer-SAS you\u2019d think he has more\nto o\ufb00er than some driving moves \u2013\nand aside from a brief showdown\nbetween him and Diesel, all Evans\nhas to do is to deliver some smug dia-logue, something he has no problem\nwith handling.\nEach good guy has something to\nbring to the \ufb01lm: Tyrese Gibson and\nLudacris are mostly there for comic\nrelief (some hits, some misses), Sung\nKang and have a love story going on,\nDwayne Johnson and Diesel \ufb02ex their\nmuscles, Walker is the eye-candy for\nthe ladies who doesn\u2019t have much to\ndo in the end, whereas Rodriguez and\nCarano show that girl-\ufb01ghts can be as\nbrutal, if not more, than boy-\ufb01ghts.\nIt\u2019s over-crowded and overlong,\nand the Rock\u2019s grossly enlarged arms\ndeserve their own end-credit mention (would NOT like to look at those\nunder IMAX conditions), but any\n\ufb01lm that pairs up Diesel and Dwayne\nJohnson for a smack-down is bound\nto be enjoyable \u2013 which is exactly\nwhat this is all about. Forget about\nlogic, forget about how two race cars\ncan slide and glide around the busy,\nbusy central London (Piccadilly\nCircus to be precise), the point is,\n\u201cthey\u2019ve got a tank\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s really all you need to know.\nAnd for die-hard fans of the fran-chise, rest assured that the sixth outing will not be this crew\u2019s last, as the\nbig cli\ufb00hanger in a post-credits scene\nshows us, there is one more vengeful antagonist for Dom to deal with,\nplayed by a charismatic actor who is\nvery good at what he does\ning a priest for the second time? (Re-member License to Wed? It\u2019s best to\nforget about that one) Such is the dire\nconcept of this horrible mess of an\nensemble comedy, a \ufb01lm that boasts\nhaving all these hugely talented stars,\nbut one that doesn\u2019t give any of the\nactors something interesting to work\nwith.\nIt must have sounded great on paper (which could explain just how on\nearth this attracted so many stars). A\nremake of a French screwball comedy,\ndysfunctional family, a wedding that\njust will not go according to plan, siblings with issues with their parents,\nand two divorced adults having to act\nas though they love each other for the\nsake of avoiding embarrassment.\nDon (De Niro) and Ellie (Keaton)\nmust act as though they\u2019re still married when their adopted Mexican son\nAlejandro (Barnes) is about to be wed\nto his love Missy (Seyfried); because\nAlejandro\u2019s birth mother is a devout\nCatholic who doesn\u2019t believe in di-vorces. Don\u2019s lover Bebe (Sarandon)\nis not happy with this arrangement\nand is ready to cook up a little revenge for her man. Also invited to the\nwedding is the uptight sister of the\ngroom Lyla (Heigl), and the 28-year-old virgin brother of the groom Jared\n(Grace).\nIt\u2019s worrying how very few jokes\nactually stick, and there is absolutely\nnothing remotely touching about the\nvarious big long speeches that are\nmade that are supposed to hint at\nnostalgia and a mature look at love.\nAttempts to throw in moments of\nraunchiness by unwisely peppering\nthe script with obscenities also fall\n\ufb02at, and it\u2019s di\ufb03cult to see just which\ndemographic this \ufb01lm is aimed at.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather gouge my eyes out with\nhot spoon\u201d says De Niro at one point.\nOh the irony...\n\n"

In some\ncases the fungus goes a step further,\ninteracting with the roots of a plant\nbeneath the ground, in a symbiotic\nor mutualistic relationship. The mycelium is highly e\ufb03cient at absorbing\nwater and minerals from the soil, and\nthe colonised plant gets the bene\ufb01t of\nthis, allowing plants to thrive even in\ndrought conditions or mineral-poor\nsoils. In return, the fungus feeds o\ufb00\nthe energy-rich sugars made and\nstored by the plant. The mutualistic\nrelationship may also increase the\nplant\u2019s resistance to disease and toxic\nmetals.\nIt has been suspected in recent\nyears that fungal connections between plants might play some role\nin communicating. The recent study,\nhowever, provides the \ufb01rst experimental evidence of this mechanism\nin action.\nThe bean plants used in the study\ncan develop resistance to infestation\nby aphids when exposed to a sample\nof the insects. However when two\nplants were connected by the fungal\nCompared to uninfected mosquitoes\nmalaria parasite-containing mosquitoes are approximately three times\nmore attracted to the smell of hu-mans, a study shows.\nThe researchers from the London\nSchool of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine infected malaria mosquitoes with\nthe deadly parasite that causes malar-ia, Plasmodium falciparum.\nThey put the mosquitoes in a container with socks that had been worn\nfor 20 hours before the experiment.\nThe scientists recorded the number\nof times the mosquitoes attacked the\nsocks.\nThey repeated the experiment with\nuninfected mosquitoes.\nThe infected mosquitoes attacked\nthe socks more often and fed for longer than uninfected mosquitoes.\nThe \ufb01ndings, published in PLOS\nONE, suggest that the malaria parasite\nmanipulates the behaviour of mosquitoes and makes them more blood\nthirsty.\nIt cannot resist the smell of human\nblood and bites more often and for\nlonger. This gives the parasite a higher\nchance of getting passed on to hu-mans, so its lifecycle and the deadly\ndisease can continue.\nNick Kennedy\nDr Logan from the London School\nof Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\nsaid, \u201cWe have shown for the \ufb01rst time\nthat the sense of smell could hold the\nkey to understanding how the parasite\nsuccessfully manipulates the mosquito to ensure its spread. Exploring this\nfurther opens up the possibility that\nwe could use this knowledge against\nthe parasite by developing tools with\ncrucial chemicals found in human\nodour.\u201d\nThese \ufb01ndings will enable researchers to develop better mosquito traps\nthat speci\ufb01cally lure malaria-infected\nmosquitoes by human scent. This\nshould help eradicate the parasite,\nwhich infects more than 200 million\npeople every year, over three times the\npopulation of the UK.\nDOI : 10.1371/journal.pone.0063602\nIf you\u2019re still in the midst of revision,\nholed up in the library, cramming\nequations and formulae into your\nswollen brain, scientists might have a\nsolution. A team of researchers have\nstudied harmless brain stimulation\nand found it can be used to improve\ncognitive ability for up to six months.\nThe team trained a group of 25 test\nsubjects in mental arithmetic whilst\nstimulating their brains using a technique called transcranial random\nnoise stimulation (TRNS). In typical\nsci-\ufb01 style, TRNS involves applying\nDC current to the scalp with electrodes in saline-soaked sponges. The\nresearchers trained the volunteers in\narithmetic drills and calculation, involving shallow and deep level brain-work respectively. By stimulating the\narea of the brain used for tricky arithmetic functions, the researchers found\nthe subjects processed unlearned material better and that 6 months after\nthe TRNS brain-training they retained\nimprovement in the deeper brain cog-nition.\nThe scientists hope the research\ncould be used to help people who suffer with neurodegenerative illness,\nstrokes or learning di\ufb03culties not\nonly in maths but also in other brain\nfunctions. Lead researcher Roi Cohen\nKadosh said, \u201cMaths is a highly complex cognitive faculty that is based on\na myriad of di\ufb00erent abilities. If we\ncan enhance mathematics, therefore,\nthere is a good chance that we will\nbe able to enhance simpler cognitive\nfunctions.\u201d\nZap your way to a better brain\nScience Writer\nVictoria Druce\nvectorbase.org\nMalaria parasite entices Anopheles mosquitoes to human odour.\n\u201c\nA new way to\nprotect agricultural crops\nagainst pests\nand disease?\n\u201d\npests\npests\nease?\nease?\nnetwork, the aphid-exposed \u2018donor\u2019\nplant was able to transfer signalling molecules through the myce-lial network to a \u2018receiver\u2019.

A \ufb01ne mesh barrier was\nused to prevent actual root-to-root\ninteractions, and controls using non-connected plants demonstrated that\nthe communication was not simply\ndi\ufb00usion through the soil, providing\nstrong evidence that the plants really\nare chatting to one another over the\nnetwork.\nThe researchers suggest that we\nmay be able to manipulate mycelial\nnetworks to develop new ways to protect agricultural crops against pests\nand disease.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\n20\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBig Headlines & Little Englanders\nPadraic Calpin gives you an update on recent happenings in British politics.\nThough everyone seems to be\nresigned to the Coalition trundling\nalong to 2015, there\u2019s still a bite\nto British (though perhaps more\nspeci\ufb01cally English) politics. It\u2019s been\na tumultuous month, with waves\nof Tory rebellion unsettling David\nCameron and the gu\ufb00awing face of\nFarage barely o\ufb00 the front pages.\nFrom\nEastleigh to\nthe Third of\nMay\nThe focus of all the noise is a newly\nbuoyant UKIP, having jumped 6-8\npoints in opinion polls in the last\ncouple of weeks after some years\nbubbling around 10% support. The\nsudden surge came just as English\nvoters prepared to go to the polls\nand elect their district and county\ncouncillors, and appeared to be\nmore than borne out; UKIP secured\nsome 23% of the vote, gaining 139\ncouncillors and splitting majorities in\ntraditional Conservative heartlands\nsuch as Kent and Lincolnshire.\nThe trouble began in March, in\nthe by-election held following Chris\nHuhne\u2019s sentencing over swapping\nspeeding points. Eastleigh, nestled in\nthe county of Hampshire, has been\na Lib-Dem seat since \u201894, with the\nbulk of the vote split between the two\nCoalition partners. But, a bullish UKIP\nturned the tables, cutting swathes out\nof the Lib-Dem and Tory vote to soar\ninto second place, some 24 points\nhigher than their result in 2010.\nDespite Eastleigh being fought\noverwhelmingly on local concerns,\nit prompted a bout of back-bench\ngrumbling within the Conservatives\nthat has kept UKIP on the front pages\nfor weeks. As the murmurs of dissent\nseep further up the party, every article\nspeculates on attempts to woo voters;\nthe Tories and the British press seem\nto be doing UKIP\u2019s work for them.\nAt the heart of the unrest is Europe,\nsomething Cameron hoped to have\nlaid to rest in January with a promised\nreferendum. And yet, while Eastleigh\u2019s\nUKIP supporters spoke of fears about\nimmigration and unemployment, the\nEU question seemed curiously absent.\nPolling from IPSOS Mori reveals it\u2019s in\nfact only the 5th most important issue\nto a UKIP voter, well behind other\nfactors. But, while Cameron did o\ufb00er\nwords on being tough on crime in the\nrun up to the local elections, it was\nall but drowned out amidst the EU\nsquabbles.\n4 Party\nPolitics?\nAs the results rolled in, the media\ncommentariat were quick to\npronounce the arrival of \u20184 Party\nPolitics\u2019 to the UK; once again,\nit seemed people were vying to\nmake UKIP\u2019s PR team redundant.\nBecause, away from the press and\nthe Conservative rebels fanning the\n\ufb02ames, the actual hard data from the\nlocal elections doesn\u2019t support such a\nstatement.\nFor one, these were English\nelections. In Scotland, Wales and\nNorthern Ireland 4 party politics\nhas long been a reality. What\u2019s more,\nin Scotland and Northern Ireland,\nUKIP\u2019s poll performance is poor to\nnonexistent. Just last week Farage\nfound himself surrounded by an\nantagonistic crowd in Edinburgh, who\nwere quick to dismiss his accusations\nof being \u201cAnti-English\u201d, insisting they\nwere protesting his \u201cBigoted, English\nNationalism\u201d.\nThen there\u2019s the results themselves.\nWhereas their overall performance,\ngaining around a quarter of the vote,\nis certainly signi\ufb01cant, the council by\ncouncil breakdown reveals a much\nmore fractured picture.\nRural English counties are a long\nstanding Tory heartland; even in\nthe north of England, councils are\nhistorically split with \u2018No Overall\nControl\u2019 by a single party. In these\ncontested Northern counties, UKIP\nregistered some 2 new councillors\nout of 433 up for election. In the west\nMidlands, too, gains were modest; 2\nseats here, 6 there.\nIt was in the east Midlands and\nSouth that UKIP made a signi\ufb01cant\nshowing, edging into Conservative\nmajorities and, in places such as\nNorfolk and Lincolnshire, pulling\nenough councillors to nudge the\ncounty into \u2018No Overall Control\u2019.\nSo, the overall picture given by the\ndata is UKIP edging into councils\nacross England, often where they\npreviously had no councillors\nwhatsoever, and in a few regions\nbecoming a signi\ufb01cant opposition.\nAnd yet, when considering the\nsigni\ufb01cance of all this we have to\nremember that these elections are only\nin rural England, in Tory heartlands.\nThe seats UKIP won were leached\naway from the Conservatives; in more\nLabour leaning counties, UKIP made\nno appearance whatsoever. In many\nregions, Labour also increased its\nshare of councillors. And in the South\nShield\u2019s by-election, triggered by\nDavid Miliband\u2019s resignation and held\nBursting the\nBubble\nThe South Shields result in particular\ngives a picture of the reality of the\nUKIP position. Their appearance in\nthe local elections is signi\ufb01cant, but it\ndoes not translate into a party on the\nverge of entering Westminster. Pulling\npredominantly from dissatis\ufb01ed Tory\nvoters, UKIP hasn\u2019t so much surged as\npoked its nose in, doubtless bene\ufb01ting\nfrom the free publicity a\ufb00orded by the\nConservative rebellion.\nThe rise of Nigel Farage cannot\nbe ignored; unlike, for example, the\nGreen party, UKIP has demonstrated\na surprisingly broad reach. However,\na more sober analysis is called for.\nUKIP\u2019s gains are tied to a wider debate\nlong overdue in British politics,\nconsidering the rise of the \u2018Political\nClass\u2019 and its estrangement from\nthe majority of British society. This\nquestion cannot be ignored, but also\ncannot be addressed by a Londoncentric media keeping Farage\u2019s face in\nthe public eye.\non the same day, the UKIP surge was\ndriven by huge cuts into the Coalition\nparties, with Labour\u2019s vote share\nbarely dented.\nNews from around the world\nObama, the new Nixon?\nObama has found himself in some\ntrouble over the past few weeks.\nAfter being accused of sexism for\ncalling the new attorney general\nthe \u201cbest-looking\u201d, Obama faced\nembarrassment as his gun background\ncheck bill was defeated in the Senate,\na strong victory for gun lobbies.\nMore recently, the Justice\nDepartment has been accused of\nspying on Associated Press (AP)\njournalistsbyobtainingmonthsworth\nof phone records. This has highlighted\nthe growing worry regarding the\nrelations of the White House, the\npress and respecting its freedom and\nthe First Amendment.\nObama has since been described as\na 21st Century Richard Nixon, tainting\nan already troublesome beginning to\nhis second term.\nMarriage for All\nThe Commons passed the same sex\nHuffington Post\nmarriage bill for England and Wales\nand French President Francois Hollande\nsigned the law allowing gay marriage\nand adoption. Gay marriage in France\nhas seen a strong response for both\npro- and anti- groups. The passing of\nthe law has led to uproar from far-right\ngroups. A renowned French historian\nhas committed suicide in protest. A rally\nis planned for Sunday to protest against\nthe law.\nTories Torn over EU\nDavid Cameron found himself once\nagain in the spotlight after Michael Gove\nand Philip Hammond declared they\nwould vote to leave the EU. The spin\ngame begins and the Prime Minister is\nattempting to present a united Party and\nCoallition front on the European ques-tion. It\u2019s like watching an episode of The\nThick Of It all over again.\nIranian Elections in June\n600 people have registered to stand\nfor the role of President, with only\neight allowed to run. President\nAhmadinejad will be stepping down.\nLittle political change is expected as\nthe candidates are mostly hardline\nconservatives.\n\n"

Little surprise then that the gig sold out\nin minutes and the queues to get in\nstarted an hour before doors opened\nThrough the delicate vocals of Lauren Mayberry and pulsing synths of\nMartin Doherty and Iain Cook, Chvrches have found a winning formula.\nCritics have drawn comparisons between them and the Canadian duo\nPurity Ring, but live the ominous bass\nsounds more like an epic blend with\ntheir fellow Glaswegians Mogwai.\nThey opened with their debut release \u2018Lies\u2019, a hypnotic electropop tune\nwhich set the mood for the rest of the\ngig. With trippy laser beams and lots\nof \ufb02ashy lights they slowly built up\nto the climax of the evening, performances of their most commercially\nsuccessful tracks \u2018Mother we Share\u2019\nand \u2018Recover\u2019. On the way though Chvrches showed they aren\u2019t just a one\ntrick pony, with Doherty taking the\nmic to perform the intimate \u2018Now is\nnot the Time\u2019. There can be no doubting the true star of the evening, the elf-ine Lauren Mayberry. Her immaculate\ndelivery and presence really captured\nthe hearts of the audience, as did her\nplayful banter on themes as diverse as\nGame of Thrones (their cover of the\ntheme went viral on YouTube), kittens\nwith laser pointers and boy bands in\nthe audience. Add to that her ability\nas an intriguing lyricist and Chvrches\nhave found a new indie heart-throb.\nTo round o\ufb00 the evening Mayberry\nperformed (as promised) a karaoke\nversion of Little Kim\u2019s \u2018Lady Marmalade\u2019 rap followed by a stunning cover\nof Prince\u2019s \u2018I would die 4 U\u2019, a song\nwhich could have been written for\nthis band. So did Chvrches live up to\nthe hype? Although they aren\u2019t quite\nthe \ufb01nished article yet a fantastic gig\nshowcased their massive potential and\nleft the audience hungry for more.\nThomas Leeman Writer\nThe Melvins have long since become\nan institution, one of the most in\ufb02uential bands in modern rock. In recent\nyears however, they have not simply\nbeen resting on the laurels of their classic albums, but exploring new territory\nand breaking new ground. Their album\nas Melvins Lite, a stripped down form\nof the Melvins with Ipecac favourite\nTrevor Dunn on double bass is one\nexample, another is their record breaking 51 states in 51 days tour last year.\nIt must be said, however, that a bit of\nretrogression from a band as great as\nthem is always appreciated, so it was\nmuch to the delight of many when two\nshows consisting of Lysol/Houdini and\nStoner Witch/Bullhead played in succession were announced.\nTrust me, it was a tough decision,\nStoner Witch is probably the most varied of the four, and the opening track\non Bullhead is so good Boris named\nthemselved after it. After much delib-eration, however, I went to the Lysol/\nHoudini night.\nAs anyone familiar with the Melvins\nknows, I was greeted by the sight of\nfour rather eccentric looking guys. If I\nseem abnormally focussed on their ap-pearances, it\u2019s merely because I want\nthe uninitiated to know how hilarious the Melvins can be. Buzzo wore a\nrobe and his sideshow Bob-like mane\n\ufb02opped to punctuate the dropping of\nevery ri\ufb00, and I\u2019m pretty sure one of\nthe drummers, Dale Crover, was wearing some kind of tunic.\nOne major di\ufb00erence is that since\n2006 Coady Willis (formerly of Big\nBusiness) has been in the band as a\nsecond drummer and there is no doubt\nthat having two drummers contributed\nto the enormity of their sound as much\nas it did to the visual presentation, with\nWillis being left handed creating a sort\nof mirror image between the 2 halves\nof the stage, where the four piece\nplayed standing in a row, rather than\nmost rock bands, who simply hide the\ndrummer in the back somewhere.\nThe set opened with Lysol and possibly the highlight of the night. \u2018Hung\nBunny\u2019, the opener of the album and\nan absolute monolith was hugely enhanced by massive drums and a punchy\nbass rumble that practically had me\nshaking. Indeed, the sound over the\nMelvins: Live Review\nRiaz Agahi Music Editor\nwhole night was excellent; incredibly\nloud, with guitar tones forming carefully controlled, resonant feedback at\nmany points.\nTheir rendition of Lysol continued\nvery much in this vein. In other words,\nit was truly crushing, with a tangible\nfeeling of euphoria in the audience\nany time they dropped a great track,\nwhich was pretty much all of them.\n\u2018The Ballad Of Dwight Fry\u2019 provided\na rare moment of relaxation amongst\nthis barrage of powerful, sludgy ri\ufb00s.\nThis response continued throughout\nthe night, throughout their rendition\nof Houdini. This is considered their\nlandmark album and generally the \ufb01rst\nalbum anyone hears, so I\u2019m sure it invited some nostalgia for more or less\neveryone there. For those not aware,\nthis album is more rocky and less\nsludgy than its predecessor. The bassy\nexcellence of \u2018Night Goat\u2019 or the particularly catchy \u2018Lizzy\u2019 stood out for\nme.\nThe set ended on a powerful note\nwith \u2018Spread Eagle Beagle,\u2019 as Buzz left\nthe stage, leaving the two drummers\nand bassist Jared Warren, (also formerly of Big Business) who was clad\nin american football padding made out\nof a cardboard box. then proceeded\nto enter the crowd screaming vocals\nwhich heavily distorted themselves,\ndecaying into feedback (possibly with\nFriday 24 May 2013\n10:00 \u2013 11:00 \u2013 Morning Musings\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 \u2013 Mad Craic\nAward-winning Mad Craic features\ntunes and banter from the wonderfully\nEnglish Craig Woods and the astonishingly Irish Aislinn Hayes\nSaturday 25 May 2013\n17:00 \u2013 19:00 \u2013ONFM (Orgasmic Noises\nFor the Masses)\nMonday 27 May 2013\n20:00 \u2013 21:00The Eclectic Ectoplasm\nAn eclectic mix of anything and every-thing.

His gleefully effusive works\nhave graced the covers of numerous pulp fiction paperbacks,\nnone of which you are likely to have read. Often working\nwith his wife as muse and collaborator the pair\u2019s execution\nis immaculate.\nBoris\u2019 familiarity with human form so complete he seems to\neffortlessly inject near fatal quantities of erotic potency into\nhis oil paintings. His sylphine, alabaster warrior princesses\nand axe-wielding beef-cake barbarians may seem dated, but\nfor pure red-blooded thrills they have never been surpassed.\nAs leader of Penguin\u2019s design team from the early 70\u2019s David\nPelham was responsible for most of Penguin book\u2019s fiction.\nHe did a number of brilliantly eye catching designs for J G\nBallards paperbacks amongst many others.\nMost famously Pelham designed the iconic cover for Anthony Burgess\u2019 A Clockwork Orange. The Cog-eyed Droog\ndesign instantly became a design classic and informed much\nof the subsequent imagery that surrounded the book and\nfilm.\nThe minimal design and sinister featureless face evokes a\ndisturbing otherworldly sense that compliments the content\nof the book.\nThe Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath featured a cover designed in 1966\nby Shirley Tucker. Sylvia Plath\u2019s only novel, published in the\nUK a month before her suicide, details the protagonist Esther\nGreenwood\u2019s descent into clinical depression.\nThe bleak outlook is perfectly encapsulated in the strikingly contemporary cover design by graphic artist Tucker. The\nbold, modernist text set above a graphic image of concentric\ncircles, creates a strong visual effect. Like all great covers, it\ndoesn\u2019t explicitly describe the plot, but rather hints at the\nstory contained within.\nShe was originally never credited with the design, a happily defunct convention. Her name now features in all modern editions.\nAlmost as mysterious as Sainger himself E. Mishael Mitchell\nis hard to get a handle on. Yet the reclusive illustrator is responsible for the cover on of the most revered pieces of modern American literature, The Catcher in the Rye.\nThe bold design is representative of the rest of his body of\nwork which features bold avant guard pen and ink drawings.\nMitchel spent much of his career as an instructor at California Institute of the Arts. Where he built a formidable reputation with his students. Mitchell passed away in 2009 at 89,\nnever again ascending so high in the popular imagination.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n31\nFRIDAY 24 MAY\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn a near-repeat performance of his\nprevious match as captain, stand-in\nskipper Vignesh Venkateshwaran led\na squad with a depleted batting line\nup to a 58-run victory over a much-vaunted St. Mary\u2019s side who had recorded some big wins of their own\nleading up to this match. Imperial\nwas put in to bat first on a slowish\ntrack with some variable bounce.\nJuhin Patel anchored the innings\nwith a solid 75 off 134 balls, nearly\ncarrying his bat. After a stern pep-talk with Juhin about not getting\ncaught playing an on-drive, the skipper , coming in 1-down, promptly\nmanaged to get dismissed in that\nexact fashion for a duck. Every dark\ncloud has a silver lining however,\nand in this case the wicket heralded\nthe arrival of club president Siddharth Kohli to the crease.\nLooking absolutely \u201cvillage\u201d\nsporting a sun-hat and basketball\nsneakers along with a standard\nrevision-paunch, he proceeded to\nsystematically dismantle the opposition\u2019s bowling attack, taking a\nparticular liking to a certain legspin-ner who hence finished with 1 for 61\noff his 10 overs. Ironically, that one\nwicket was that of Siddharth him-self, who had made his way to 49 off\n42 balls without realising how close\nhe was to a half-century. He hence\nattempted to heave a flighted de-livery, only to pop it up straight in\nthe air for a straightforward catch,\nbreaking the hearts of his teammates\nand inducing a rare smile from the\nopposition. Some ordinary batting\nfollowed before Juhin finally fell after his long vigil.\nShezad Ahmed played a handy\nknock down the order with most of\nthe tail for company. He batted with\nthe classic elegance of a left-hander,\nfirm in defence against good balls\nbut very severe on those in the hitting zone, with most of such deliveries being promptly dispatched over\ncow corner. A few heart-in-mouth\nmoments occurred, particularly\nwith Shezad and Darshan \u201cZombie\u201d\nPatel being dropped off successive\ndeliveries. Finally, with the perfect\nforward defence of Simon Mitchell\nholding up one end, Shezad struck a\nfew lusty blows to finish not out on\n39. Imperial posted a daunting 207\nfor 9, which we felt was more than\nenough to defend with our bowling\nattack.\nThe second innings was anchored\nby one of the opposition\u2019s opening\nbatsmen, who finished with a hard-fought 57. After his whirlwind knock\ndown the order, Shezad took the first\nwicket following a good accurate\nspell of bowling, and he was ably\nsupported by Simon from the other\nend, who toiled hard on an unhelpful\ntrack. The balance was shifting ever\nso slightly towards our opposition,\nbut the introduction of spin changed\nthat completely. Makhan Gill helped\nhimself to a wicket, before Siddharth\ncapped off a Man-of-the-match\npeformance with 4 for 29 off 8 overs.\nThe captain Vignesh took the responsibility of bowling to the two\nset batsmen from the other end and\ndismissed both the set opener for 57\nas well as a middle-order stalwart\nfor 32, finishing with figures of 4 for\n23 off 8.5 overs. Barring a couple of\nmisfields and some tough chances\nput down by Siddharth, the fielding display was generally imperious,\nand ultimately it was a long spell of\nquick, quiet overs which delieverd\nthe victory for ICUCC as St.Mary\u2019s\ncrumbled to 149 all out.\nSports Writer\nArvind Rajagopalan\nOn a \ufb01ne English summer\u2019s day \u2013\nwith temperatures soaring to 10 de-grees, 11 of the bravest and \ufb01ercest\nImperial cricketers stepped onto the\nsacred Harlington turf we call home\nto battle UCL, led by the one and\nonly Will Baker. With heavy cloud\ncover and strong winds, UCL were\nput into bat.\nWe were looking to improve on our\nstart against them last year \u2013 7 runs\n0 balls bowled. It didn\u2019t prove to be\ntoo di\ufb03cult. The tone of the game\nwas set in the third over when Viggy\nVenkateswaran castled their only\nbatsman with a loopy full toss. From\nthen on Umar Minhas kept pegging\naway at the tail \u2013 picking up the only\ndecent wickets \u2013 while the spinners\nkept beating the batsmen with their\n\ufb02ight \u2013 di\ufb03cult to judge after the\nsecond bounce \u2013 the special wicket\ntaking ball in Viggy Venkataraman\u2019s\narsenal. Ganesh Kumar was steaming in the whole way through \u2013 with\nsome good overs and then showing\nus all how a catch should really be\ntaken!\n17 overs and 6 wickets later \u2013 with\nUCL tottering at 80/6 \u2013 in walked\nMr. Cricket. The only man with\nproper whites and would you believe\nit, he had his own bat! Taking guard\nhe looked like the complete bats-man. Had they reversed their batting\norder? 20 dot balls and 10 play and\nmisses later our question was an-swered: no they hadn\u2019t!\nSoon after the departure of Mr.\nCricket \u2013 UCL tumbled and were\npacked away for 110 in 29 overs with\nDarvin Davis skittling the tail.\nLomas Persad and Yash Verma\nstrolled out stu\ufb00ed on the low budget\nand extremely sugary teas. Chasing\n111 in 50 overs \u2013 the pressure was\non us from the very \ufb01rst ball. With\nthe help of some average bowling Lomas and Yash raced to 50 in 6 overs.\nAlong came their trump card \u2013 our\nsupposed kryptonite \u2013 but even he\nwas no match for Lomas who took\n20 o\ufb00 his over, dispatching him to all\nends of the \ufb01eld.\nSome classy batting followed and\nwe chased down the total within 14\novers with Lomas ending up with a\nwell deserved 59*(37) and Yash with\n41* (40), thus completing a perfect\nday of cricket and an impeccable\nstart to the season for Imperial 2\u2019s.\nYash Verma Sports Writer\nICUCC continue on their successful season\nImpeccable Imperial 2\u2019s\nSt Mary\u2019s put to the sword\n\n"

This is its favourite\nhouse; the one in the country\nwith the shooting range and\nlake. This rare astrological\nevent means that you will fail\nall your exams and spiral into\na black hole of despair while\neveryone in your project\ngroup bitches about how you\naren\u2019t pulling your weight.\nThisweekyoucan\u2019tunderstand\nwhy your housemates love Fifa\nso much. You conclude they\nhave been brainwashed by a\npixelated Lionel Messi, and\nsmash up their screen to free\nthem from their trance. They\nfeel angry rather than liberated,\nbut at least they might have\ntime clean more now the TV\u2019s\nbroken. Every cloud\u2026\nThis week the brightness of\nJupiter means that your cum\nwill turn blue on the eve of the\n25th. It will permanently stain\nanything it touches, including your favourite wank sock.\nWait, is that blue on your lips?\nNow everyone knows you like\nto taste your own ejaculate\n(or can suck yourself off in\nwhich case, fair enough).\nThis week you grow an extreme female equivalent of\na revision beard. When you\nfinish exams, your lady garden has grown so thick and\nmatted that you are unable\nto trim it, and there is no way\nthrough the curly forest for\nany potential explorers. You\nare doomed to a life of kera-tin-induced celibacy.\nThis week Pluto\u2019s view of the\nsun is eclipsed by Earth. Cold\nand excluded, Pluto vows\nrevenge by exiting orbit and\ncolliding with the Arctic ice\nmass. All the ice melts, and\nsea levels rise so much that\nanyone not climbing Mount\nEverest is submerged in a sea\nof screaming bodies. How\nlong can you tread water?\nThis week your favourite\nexam pen stabs you in the\neye, blinding you. You are\nheartbroken that your relationship could end in such\na bitter way after all the\nclammy 3 hour embraces\nyou have shared. Joke\u2019s on\nit though, as you\u2019ll have no\nneed for it now you have to\nwrite in Braille.\nThis week Saturn\u2019s moons\nare aligned, a sure sign that\nyour toe hairs will get crabs.\nThey nestle in the skin folds\nwhere your toe joint is, revelling in the cheesy moistness.\nYou try to burn them off with\nacid but your whole toe dissolves while they crawl up\nyour leg in search of a hairier\nresting place.\nThis week, you seek peace and\nquiet for revision in the network\nof tunnels under Imperial. But\nvicious glowing rats, fluorescent as a result of an unhappy\nlove tryst between genetically\nengineered mice and a horny\nsewer rodent, seek you out and\nnibble you to shreds before\nyour flesh becomes sour with\nasbestos contamination.\nThis week, you wish that your\nhoroscope would predict fame\nand fortune for once. But the\nstars don\u2019t lie: you are doomed\nto fail at life and love. You realise that if you were less intelli-gent, you might lack the neural\nconnections necessary to recognise failure. So you cut out\nyour brain and subsist in eternal vegetative ignorance.\nThis week you get food poisoning the morning of your\nlast exam. Your insides erupt\nall over your answer booklet\nabout 2 hours in, destroying any marks you may have\nmanaged to get. What\u2019s\nworse, you now have to cancel your summer trip around\nThailand so you can do re-takes. Pint?\nThis week the library printer\nis so fed up of printing badly-written coursework that it swallows you whole and holds\nyou hostage in paper tray 2. It\nstarts flashing error messages\nin Morse code to communicate\nthe ransom for your release,\nbut no one understands so it\ndrowns you in ink and spits you\nout while flashing \u2018paper jam\u2019.\nThis week you must choose\nbetween two pets: a squirrel\nthat constantly pelts you with\nacorns, or a meerkat that\nconstantly humps your leg.\nOn the one hand, the acorns\ncould seriously deplete your\nbrain cells, while on the oth-er, a jizzing meerkat would\ncost a fortune in cleaning\nbills. What\u2019s it going to be?\nHOROSCOPES\nTHE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS\nDOG ARRESTED AFTER\nEXPERIMENTING WITH LSD\nHangman\u2019s Finest College News Source\nthe turnip\nHot on the heels of the internationally acclaimed bouncy castle and petting zoo on the Queen\u2019s Lawn, Imperial College Union has announced,\nin junction with Imperial College a\ncollege-wide Nerf war.\nScheduled to start on Monday 3rd\nJune, with the assassination of the\nRector, there is only one rule \u2013 the\nlast department standing wins. All\nstudents that participate in the con\ufb02ict, and survive, will receive an automatic 70% in all exams taken this\nterm. Treachery will be rewarded by\na Nerf \ufb01ring squad, followed by their\nname being added to the roster for the\nend of term fruit-pelting.\nThe warzone is spread over the\nwhole campus, with College security\nmonitoring the war, to identify casu-alties, and record death tolls. There\nare no safe areas on campus, and the\nCollege will be open 24/7 during this\nperiod of con\ufb02ict.\nWeapons and darts will be supplied at the start of the week, through\nweapon caches hidden throughout the\ncampus \u2013 each department will contain one crate of projectile weapons,\nand one of melee weapons. Weapon\ndrops may be called in to Queen\u2019s\nLawn. For those of you who wish to\n\ufb01ght for the glory of your department,\nyet have no training, the Union will\nbe hosting a \ufb01ring range and weapon\nsafety school, during lunchtimes of\nnext week.\nThe College and Union will accept\nno liability for failed exams or nemeses created during this time.\nImperial full of nerfs\n\n"
