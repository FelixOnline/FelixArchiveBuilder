    "content": "X FTMX\n'\nWARE IHVTjrj\nGENERAL STUDIES\nSHEER POETRY\nPoetry \"began as a branch of magic\nthe \"basis of the rhythmic implications\nthrough which roan could describe life to himself, his means of exploring for\nknowledge by imitating nature. This\nimitation continued in England up to\nthe Augustan period, said Cecil Day\nLewis in hi3 lecture on \"The Poet in Theory\", as a form of moral improve-ment, picturing virtue in words and\neducating by example.\nThe poet is a spokesman of the\ncommunity, in so far as he is influenced\nby society: his poetry is inseparable\nfrom propaganda for building up morale,\nin the same way as the artist's paintings\nin the Middle Ages followed Christianity.\nFurther, this recording and praising of\nlife is for giving us pleasure at the\nsame tine.\nPoetry has now become a recreation,\nwhere the poet explores life to further\nhis own personal understanding: he is not primarily concerned with cor arr runic at in$ anything, and is oblivious of his\nfuture audience. In the past, copying\nhad no shame attached to it, but now\noriginality is at a premium, and Mr.\nLewis believes that friction between\nthe poet and society will produce the\nbest effects.\nBut, theorising apart, poetry is to give pleasure: ancient man used\nrefrain and repetition to remove evil spirits this was the earliest demonstration of man*s desire for form\nand order in the hitherto un tethered diversity of life. Tod -y, \"the\nfertilisation of the soul is the reason\nfor the necessity of art:\" it ij M reese s our understanding of life by giving us\nk knowledge unobtainable elsewhere, and\nis the only means of s tabi lising the\nfleeting moment and emphasising it. Since words are used for so many\npurposes other than poetry, poetic\nlanguage, the source of wh i oh was the\nreligious incantation, has been introduced, although this also brings the\ndanger of a lot of talk without any\nmeaning. Nevertheless, poetry is great\nby virtue of its language rather than\npure originality, and any Torce is derived solely from the intrinsic virtue\nof the lines themselves.\nICWA WINS THE TOSS\nTwelve o 'clock on Shrove Tuesday\nfound the Chairman of Entertainments\nsupervising the preparation of the\n\"batons\" for the annual men . I. C.W. A. Pancake Race. Being an engineer he\ndirected the mixing and cooking of the\npancakes with strict adherence to\nBritish Standards.\nI. C.W. A. were sporting a strong\nteam, mostly members of the victorious\nI.C. W.S.C. team which went to Delft.\nThe men's team included our beloved\nWarden (see photo.), Dr. Kenneth\nWooley (see Sennet) alias Ken Weal,\nand a remarkably agile President.\nThe men, fortunately ble seed with\na rather tough British Standard pan oak ej lost much ground due to excessive back-bending, and in the last leg, Tony\n^Tub) Iwart was necking and necking\nwith Hilary Torapsett, but, with 50\nyards and two tosses to go he dropped\nthe pancake. There was much weeping\nand gnashing of teeth among the\nassembled throng. Thus I. C.W. A. won the contest, and gained the\no ove ted Shrove Tuesday frying pan.\nENGINEER'S BALL Last Friday, City and Guilds College\npresented their annual Engineer's Dinner\nand Dance. The Dinner, held in the\nLower Dining Hall and the Upper Refectory, was indeed a welcome change from\nheme cooking and the usual dismal product of the Mooney cuisine. ' i est of\nHonour was Professor Saunders, the Dean\nof City and Guilds, who proposed the\ntoast of the college, to which the President Dave Cxark responded. Mike Newson got up to speak and launched into\na long series of Engineering jokes, and\nit was not until long after that j* was\nfound that he was welcoming the Guests.\nRuby Rubenstein, an Old Centralian, responded , and closed the official pro-cee dings. The exceedingly replete assembly\nmigrated to the Concert Hall, and it was not until much later, when the effect\nof the meal wore off, that the term\n\"da no ing\" could be applied to their\nc irc uma m bulat ion. The band may have\nbeen lacking in n\\un eric al strength, but\ntheir sheer stamina was prodigious, as\nwas more than adequately displayed in their marathon Cha-cha-chas. The\nevening was characterised by a real\nsense of friendliness, so often lacking\non formal occasions such as these. The\nevening, or rather, the morning as it then was, closed with the traditional\nBoomalaka.\ns LOON COON Forty-nine oom petit i or s a et oat\nfrom the Start of the C.*G. Meter\ndub's Loon-Goon Night Rally last Feb.\n6th. Although the weather was crisp\nand clear to begin with, the route soon\nran into thick fog wh i oh began to take\nits toll of competitors by one means\nor another. With visibility down to\n20 ft. and less, and a tight time\nschedule to keep to many oars had damaging encounters with parts of the\nscenery. 'lie stories naturally be o a aw all the better for the telling, but\nbriefly the o aau al ty list was as\nfollows:\nAn Austin 7 over-looked a left\nheader, rolled onto its roof, and then\nsomersaulted back onto its wheels.\nIt was driven home.\nA Biley Special stove dits front\nin on a bank when the driver lost the\nroad in the fog at aT jun tion, and\nwent straight on.\nA Marri3 Minor van couldn'tle aide wh i oh branch of a fork to\ntake so the driver o hose the middle\npath. There was a house there.\nA Ford Anglia grazed a bank and\nbent a wing, whilst a Ford Taunus\nbumped the curb and dislocated the\nfront suspension.\nMechanical failures put out another\nAustin 7 and another Riley; whilst one\ncrew retired with o arbon monoxide\npoisoning.\nIn addition to all thi3 a marshal\nlost two front teeth in a fight (with\na non-competitor) and even this was\nafter he had been in the ditch off a motor-bike.\nWith the conditions as they were\nit is not so surprising that only 19\nout of the original 49 finished the\ncourse. The winner was G.F. Howard\nclosely followed by M.J. Gibson, both\nof whom were Guildsmen.\nUNION MEETING\nCONTINUED FROM FRONT PAGE\n(2) That this Union considers that, in general, Wardens of College Halls\nof Residence should be appointed\nfrom the Academic Staff.\nIt was proposed by Peter Levin,\nwho said that through the medium of\nHostel life, the students and Staff\nexert a civil ising influence on one-another. Fe pictured an hostel run by\none of the Admin, as a barracks; an\ninstitution with personnel devoted to\nrunning student l if<_. He declared that\nthe Admin were \" like ruddy rabbits, or\nrather worse as one rabbit by itself is relatively harmless.\"\nWhen a ak ed whether the motion, if passed would carry any weight with the\nPower.-th ab be, the President said that,\nconstitutionally, the matter was no\no on cern of the students. In general,\nit was felt that although not all of t the Admin, would necessarily be bed, it was better to adopt a safe policy by\nchoosing the Academic Staff. The\nmotion was carried with only three voting against.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nS \u00a3/?/OUSLY SPEAKING\nBY SIG\nThe writings of Sig are, to a rather obvious extent baaed on such\nmaterial - emphasising ludicrous\nconnections and exaggerations, suo h as\none would expect to find in dreams.\nThis, of o our se, requires little talent, but o an provide both amusement and instruction far the part ici pants. Amusement? because the human\nmind is not an entirely serious machine-there is always a pla oe far that elusive\nquality called 'humour' and which we\nalways consider everyone else has a twisted sense of.\nFar several weeks now, thi3 column has been a vehicle for some\nrather curious articles made up very\nlargely of psychologically \"loaded\"\nmaterial. This has been far a reason,\nnaturally, and Sig hopes that his readers will find it of interest.\nFirst of all, by way of introduction,\nwhy should there have been any discussion at all of the 'rubbish' (as some\nhave called it) that has appeared here?\nAdmittedly, it was nonsense of a type.\nIn fao t, nonsense does not exist -everything has a reason and can be\nconnected with something else - \"non-sense\" is merely something that does not\nappear to tie in with the accepted\nlines of thought or the customs of the\nparticular society that you live in.\nIf there is no nonsense, in the usually\naccepted meaning of that word, what\nthen are we left with? Consider\nyour dreams, for it is then that the\ncareful guard that you normally have\nover your thoughts i3 no longer on\nduty. How often do we all dream what\nwe are satisfied to call \"nonsense\".\nYet it is this very material - without\nconnections, relations or any obvious\nreference to our spatial lives which\nis constantly in the process of being\nmoulded in our unconscious.\nWas the writing of Sig necessary\nor important? The answer to that\nis neither \"Yes\" nor \"No\". Because\nthey have been written directly, without the interference of thought and\nanalysis, Sig' s so rib bling s' have\nappealed mainly to people who feel\nrather than think: such people are\nneither better nor worse than anyone\nelse, they are just different. It so\nhappens (otherwise he could not have\nwritten them) that Sig believes in the\n\"engagement\" theory of human existence\nwhich means that we are in instantaneous\ncontact with the outside world. What\nwe each make of, and with, this world\ndepends on the mental attitudes that\nwe each have, and have developed. It\nis a medical fao t that, barring mal-formations, we all possess the same\nphysical basis to our mentality. What\ndiffers between 'personalities' is the\nrelative flexibility and nimbleness\nof that delicate machine, the human\nbrain. This fao t makes nonsense, in literal terms, of barriers, whether\nsocial religious or otherwise.\nThis also means that for anyone to\nclaim a complete understanding of the\nhuman spirit or the totality of human\nwisdom, is as ridiculous as to claim that\nany one human language o an contain\nanything but a fraction of the total of\nhuman truth and beauty.\nThe Chinese have a proverb:\n\"The bullfrog rent its throat\ntrying to tell the eagle how to fly\"\nThis is a timely reminder to all who\nwould write and tell others what they\nCOLLEGE OIL-STRIKE\nYESTERDAY STUDENTS\nOf IMPERIAL COLLBQB\nS1KUCK OIL IN THE QUAD.\nLAST N/ SHTi SXCLUSIVfi PICTURE OF THE IMPERIAL\nC0H.E6E GUSHER\n\"DON'T BE AFFECTED BY RICHES\nAPPEALS RECTOR\nthe i.c. \u00abfct<jr\nsaid last *j0 \u00abt that \u00ab\u00a3\nhoped students would\nnot let wealth co to their heads. the president had 5eta splendid\nexample .... his only\nconcession to newfound wealth was a NEWTIrt OFSlMOtilZ FOR\nHis scooter .\nunfortunately\nsome students we rc Letting the whole\ncolle oe down . they\ndid not think 0fo the/& with the \u00abes u u that\nworkers at rolls\u201e_ ROYCE WiHE NOW\nMS\u00a3 ON \"DOUBLE- TlMl\n\" IT WAS J MR KANa j DAMP JOWIa* THEftg\n/V 'WflJL\"REPORTER\nlast n1& ht questioned f> Student about work ok\nthe oil well.\n\" with only one\ncompanion i spent z months in a conf'hed\nSPACE.

    "content": "/celiac s NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT\nDear Sir, It was obvious, from the violent reaction from the floor at the SoperCurran debate on Britain' s Nuclear\nPolicy, that there are a large proportion of I.C. students sympathetic to the cause of Nuclear Disarmament. If this be the case, why on earth do they\ncontinually fail to respond to the\nchallenge and not support a Nuclear\nDisarmament Group at I.C.? Such a Group has existed since last March,and\nyet the response to a letter to Felix and a meeting last May was negligible.\nIt is true that the Nuclear\nDisarmament Committee has been severely\nrestricted in its manoeuvres: the\nestablishment is seldom en amour ed to the\nthought of spontaneity, obvious in the\ncondition for the formation of a new\nsociety. To have to pass a constitution through to two sittings of the\nSocial Clubs Committee which meets one\na term is quite ludicrous. Furthermore,\nto forbid the use of notice boards without the co noes sion of a right-wing Union\nOffice is quite clearly designed to kill all initiative at birth; to\nhave to stand off the pavement to\ndistribute leaflets at I.C. is wicked,\nespecially in weather such as this. How much warmer and congenial are the\nconditions inside the Union lounge?\nIh spite of the difficulties enumerated above, it is still possible\nfor a Nuclear Disarmament Group tofu notion effectively within the College.\nAll that is required is a nucleus of\nsome twenty or thirty people who are\nprepared to give a few hours a week.\nConsidering the time spent by the\naverage student sipping coffee or beer\nthis would amount to a very small\nsacrifice. In o losing I would sym pathis e with\nwith one of your correspondents Sir, who recently complained of the d is appointment he feels about student life and attitude at I.C.I would add a further complaint: lethargy. I willingly salute my active opposition;\nat least they have convictions. I also acknowledge the devotion to duty\ndisplay id by the majority of Union\nofficials, to whom we are all indebted.\nThe irritant is the student who is unable to see beyond the pint, text\nbook or confines of his college or\nhome.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Finney\nEDITOR'S NOTE\nOn points of information:-a) The constitution of a new society\ndoes not have to pass through two\nsittings of the S. C.C. Onoe the\nS. C.C. has passed it and it has\nbeen approved by the Union Executive,\nthe society o an be formed.\nb) The S. C.C.s its at least two or\nthree times per term, more frequent\nmeetings are unnecessary as there\nis in suf fi ent business to merit\nthem.\ne) The Nuclear Disarmament Committee\nhas\"never applied for membership of\nS. C.C. MAC REPLIES\nDear Sir, Mr. Brookes' letter gives the\nimpression that he is totally unaware\nof the position of the cartoonist when\npresenting such issues as that dealt\nwith by my cartoon.\nI think that it is reasonable to classify this cartoon as broadly\n\" political\" in this context \" polit i cal\" denotes that it dealt with\no on f lio ting opinions, not that the controversy was of polit io al origin.\nIn such circumstances it is not the\nplace of the cartoonist to state his own opinion (which is of no interest)\nbut to observe the widely-held views\nof others and present them through\nhis particular medium in a way that is( he hopes!) mainly humourous, yet with\na slight undercurrent of acerbity.\nI had always considered that anonymity was a privilege to be invoked\nby any writer or cartoonist - who\ncared to do so, that it could even be\na virtue. ( I have certainly never\nheard the right to use a nom de plume\nquestioned except in oases of black-mail. ) Mr. Brookes, however, thinks\notherwise. More, he dictates that ^\nshould think otherwise, for his parenthetic comment \" is he ashamed to reveal his identity?\" is not just an\nexclamation requiring no reply, but\na challenge that he knows I cannot\nrefuse. Thus I must sign this letter sorrowfully, becuase I know of one\nperson at least who will be very d is appointed (he confided in me that\n\"Mao\" was really Mr. Garnett seeking\nsolace in his old age by drawing!) -but I shall continue to use my \"nom\nde cartoon\". It is for the very\n'great, and them only, to write their full names on their doodles, and I am\ncertainly no Ronald Searle.\nYours, etc.\nJ. M. McNeil\n(Aero. 1)\nFRESHER S RECEPTIONS Due to the increasing numbers\nof Freshers every year at Imperial\nCollege there has \"been for many years\na very evident need for the streamlining\nof the Freshers1\nreceptions, which are\nheld by the I.C. Union immediately prior to the commencement of the academic\nsession in October.\nThe main difficulty in the past has\nbeen the limited space and also the short\ntime available in the afternoon. The\nFreshers' Reception next year will therefore occupy the complete day aid more\nspace will be made available in the\nUnion Building for the social and a thr let ic clubs.\nPreviously Freshers were separated\naccording to whether or not they permanently resided in t..e vicinity of\nLondon, but the di\\. sion will now be\nmade into undergraduates and postgraduates. This is only a small step, long\noverdue, but I sincerely hope that it will be the first one leading to a very much improved Reception.\nR. ff.T. GAR&PITT\nPresident, I.C. Union.\nNELSON S COLUMN\nMembers of the R.S. M. Union were amazed\nto hear at their last Union \"nee ting, that their Hon. Pornographer had been\nlocked in the Hostel room of an ICWArian\nof very high office. (She has made a special request that her name should\nnot be mentioned in this column again)\nHowever, the Miners await their next\nmeeting with bated breath.\nNelson congratulates Cleopatra upon\nhearing that Bedford College wish to\nprint her Wallulk Rating in their news-paper. However, he doubts the accuracy\nof its interpretation, finding that his own is+20. Congratulations also to Guilds cm organ-ising the best Carnival of recent years,\nalthough one wonders whether the door-handles were torn off the Concert Hall doors by those trying to gain entrance\nor those trying to escape.\nWhilst the competition for Mr I. C.W. A. of 1959 has aroused a great deal of\namusement at I.C., Nelson would have\nthought that the ladies of I. C.W. A. were far more qualified than the men\nto propose the nominees - well, Just\nlook who's been proposed!\nNo wonder the Miners made a come-back\nin the Rector's Cup - half of them were\nwatching International, no-holds-barred\nwrestling in the Albert Hall on the\nprevious ene ning. The other Thursday afternoon Nelson observed \"Jezebel\" almost obscured under\na swarm of female models being photographed in Imperial Institute Road. In\nan exclusive interview , however, Mr.\nPeter Kassler B8c., A.R.C.S.,. President\nof the R. C.S.U., neither denied nor\nconfirmed the rumour that copies are to\nbe circulated to 300 female institutions throughout the country in order to\nattract more girls to R.C.S. TOAST\nDear Sir, With reference to the oom ment of\nyour reporter on the activities of\nI. C.W. S.C.,I would like to point out\nthat although IC men are notoriously\ndiscourteous, only a small proportion\nof the \"gentlemen\" present at the Hall Dinner mentioned refused to toast\n\"Victorious Women\". I am sure that\nl! hey,like myself, modified the toast\nto \"Victorious ICWSC\".\nI am Sir, yours etc.,\nMisogynist\nMINES CARNIVAL\nH osr tr OIL\n\n"

He was referring, in fact, to\nthe situation reported in 'Sennet'\nas being in force at Battersea.\nThis was (at the time), that the President had resigned, and after some\nreported machinations, the Principal\nhad taken over the Union.\nThe bright remark heading this col urn is typical of the complacency which,\nmagnified a little, permits revolutions\nto happen, allow a Dachau to be built unquestioned and so forth.

Union Office.\nNot all human emotions are happy\none3, and yet those which produce\nfrustrating circumstances in real life, or in a play, may well arouse in the\naudience a feeling of happiness and\npride in the heroism of the characters\ninvolved.\nSuch a situation is created in A MEMORY OF TWO MONDAYS, by Arthur\nMiller, the American playwright, to be presented on Granada T.V. at 9 p.m. this evening. It has been described\nby the author as a \"pathetic co raed y\", and tells of a boy who works among people for a couple of years, sharing in their troubles, their hope3 and successes:\nand when the time comes to depart, they\nbarely notice it. He is left to endure\nalone the absence of hope of all that\nhe had lived for.\nSeveral theatres outside the\nWest End have plays prior or subsequent to their main London production\nand these may provide excellent entertainment with less travelling: for example, this week at the Streatham\nHill Theatre is EXPHESSO BONGO, the\nlively musical set in a coffee bar,\nwhich ran for nine months at the\nSeville Theatre. Then, at the\nWimbledon Theatre is Arthur Miller's A VIE' FROM THE BRIDGE, which has\nnow escaped from- the Theatre Clubs,\nAlso in South London, at the\nRichmond Theatre this week, is Robert Anderson's TEA .v ND SYMPATHY\nwhile at the Theatre Royal, Stratford,\nE., is a new play FINGS AIN'T WOT\nTHEY USED T 'BE telling of Fred\nJi 6 wat th knowing.\nCochran's attempts to run a dilapidated\ndive, constantly visited by the police\nuntil he is ousted by a smart new boy\nwith a rival establishment.\nAs to new films, apart from LA\nGRANDE ILLUSION at the Academy Cinema\n(mentioned in the last issue), there\nis DANGER WITHIN at the Odeon, Leicester\nSquare, starring Richard Todd, Richard\nAttehborough, Michael Wilding and\nDonald Houston. This is another war\nstory set in a prison camp, but for some reason, which is not very apparent\nthere is one man who does not want the\nothers to escape: however, for a film on this theme to receive good Press\nreports, as this one has, it must have\nsomething to raise it above the milieu.\nTurning to exhibitions, on until next Friday at the Building Centre,\nStore Street, is LE CORBUSIER Exhibition\ncelebrating the seventieth birthday of\nthis versatile exponent of architecture,\nT>ainting, sculpture and tapestries.\nAlso at the same place is a permanent\nbut changing exhibition of buildings\nand their equipment.\nThen, until the end of next week\nthere is an exhibition at Selfridges\nof \"Leather Furniture on Parade\", to\nreawaken any interest in the possibilities of a material which has lost much of its popularity since the war.\nLIT.& DEE The 12th February wa3 an important\nday for the Debating Society when Dr.\nDonald Soper and Mr. Charles Curran\ncame to college to debate the motion:\n\"That the Government's Nuclear Policy\nis Inconsequent\".\nThe Chairman, Dr. Allan, said that\nhe had some doubts on the meaning of the\nward \"in consequent\", but took the\nmotion to mean that some people were\nin favour of the govt's policy while\nothers were against it. Accordingly,\nhe invited Dr. Soper to speak against\nit.\n\"It is wrong for Christian countries to attempt to carry a cross in one\nhand and a nuclear weapon in the other\",\nsaid Dr. Soper. He was also opposed\nto the policy on practical grounds:\n\"It is re ok less to muck about with\ncos mio forces which are not fully under-stood.\n\"\nWhom the gods destroy they first\nmake mad\", he said and carried on to\ncondemn \"silly men like Selwyn Lloyd\nand Dulles. Tt was wrong for Dulles\nto say he would go to war\". He quoted\nLord Birdwood who had said that he would\nrather die than live under Communist\ntyranny, and asked if Lard Birdwood\nwould be willing far millions of other\npeople to die because of his personal\nviews. Dr. Soper advocated an international solution to the problem, as\nhe thought national barriers to be no\nlonger opposite.\nMr. Curran disliked Dr. Soper's presentation of the argument, saying\nthat-it was not a choice between lunatics\non one side and intelligent people on\nthe other. Both Labour and Conservative governments had pursued the policy\nof the nuclear deterrent. He pointed\nout that there was a Labour government\nwhen the first A bomb was dropped, and\nthat it was the decisions of a Labour\ngovernment to manufacture H bombs and\nallow American air bases in this co un try. He quoted Earl Attlee: \"I supported making the bomb, because it was the only policy wh i oh has kept the\nRed Army where it is\". If Donald\nSoper thought Christianity was opposed\nto farce, then said Mr. Curran, he\nshould start by converting the Archbishops of Canterbury and go on to the\nVatican. As he did not agree with\ncapitulation to the Soviet threat, and\nas nuclear knowledge could not be\neradicated, he thought the only solution\nwas one to be brought about by political discussion.\nFloor speeches were noticeably\nlacking in opposition to the motion.\nThe theme of a number of speakers was\nthat money spent on defence would be\nbetter used in the economic war for\nthe support of the underdeveloped co un tries. Some people felt the Russians\nwere ignorant. A number of non-politicians present thought the problem\nwas all the fault of the \"blasted\npoliticians\".\nSumming up. Dr. Soper said he did not\nthink the Russians were waiting far\nwar, and therefore he was in favour of\nabandoning the cold war.\nMr. Curran thought that Communism\nwas still a treat and that what was\nwanted was a bargain. \"But,\" he said,\n\" it takes two to make a bargain\", and\nthe Russians always stuck at the idea\nof foreign observers.\nThe Chairman declared the \"ayes\"\nto have it, after a show of hands, but\nthe House was obviously quite evenly\ndivided.\n\n"

Qarnett announced to the Union Meeting on\nTuesday last that David Irving had\nbeen dismissed from the post of Editor\nof PHOENIX due to his unwillingness to\nco-operate with the Board of Directors.\nThis is the final and inevitable\nstep in the controversy that has swept\nI.C. during the past few months. Inevitable because of the truly unique\npsychology of Mr. Irving\" who \"accepts\nno middle path or in his own words:-'is\nthe only one in step'\" - I quote Dave\nClark.\nA lengthy debate ensued on the\nwhole question of PHOENIX, and ge her al Editorial polio y. John Cox summed up\nthe the widespread feeling by saying\nthat the magazine will only be successful if there is mutual trust between\nthe Editor, Editorial Board and the\nBoard of Directors, and that the Editor\nshould indeed accept any recommendations\nmade by the Board. No such trust has\nexisted recently, leading to perfidy on\nall sides.\nBut this was not the only topic of\ninterest at the meeting; there were\nalso two motions before the House:(1 ) That the Union should commit the\nmascots of the three constituent\noo lle ges to a place of reverence\nand safety, and that they should\nbe left there as a symbol of the\nhooliganism of the past.\nThis was proposed by Messrs. Chadwick and Bramley. The motion was\nproposed \"as a stimulus for introspective analysis\" Chad said that the\nconstituent college Presidents were\nsomewhat peeved, and slightly embarrassed by their mascots. Do they, in\nfact serve any useful purpose? Why is it necessary to follow the example of\nlesser London College?\nMike Amos, in reply, described\nChad (ex-I.C. President) as one who had\ngiven all his usefulness and vitality\nto the college. Accordingly he proposed an am mend ment to the motion to the\ns ff ect that past Presidents as well as\nthe mascots should be committed hence.\nThis was further am mended to include\nMr. Bramley, who then seconded the\nmotion and urged us to throw away \"those\nsilly little toys\"\nPeter Kassler declared that in relieving their mental constipation,\nC.&B. had completely missed the point.\nDave Clark agreed, and considered that\nthe mascots had a maturing influence on\na new President, while Graham King contended that they did not use their\nmascot as a rallying point as Miners\nhad sufficient spirit there already. The\nmotion was rejected.\nA. J. PRITCHARD SCORING THE FIRST GOAL FOR L,u. AGAINST BBJGS\nESSAY PRIZE\nThe winners of the Sir Artnur Acland Essay Prize for 1959 have just been\nannounced.

Onion meeting was held\non Tuesday, 10th February, the main\npart of the proceedings being devoted\nto debate on Constituent College Hostels.\nMr. Butters, Prepo&ing-, said that\nI.C. is what it is just because of the\nexistence of the constituent colleges;\nmixed halls of residence would exterminate the constituent colleges. The\nOld Student Associations have roots in the college system and it is difficult to see how they would continue. The\nsystem produces four different admin-is tr at ive bodies giving possibility to a far greater number of people taking\npart, and raise the I.C. President above\npetty or small loyalties. Mr. Finch, in opposing the motion,\nsuggested that R.C.S. should mix with\nGuilds in order to turn them into\ndecent citizens. Even the Rector could\nsee this argument and the Rector had\nnot been an official of the R.C.S. Onion.\nOn a more serious level t Mr. Finch suggested technical difficulties in split ting up between three colleges seven\nhalls of residence to be built within\na period of fifteen years.\nMr. Emerson, seconding the motion,\nsaid that as we have no Arts here but\nhave a broad range of character in each\ncollege, we shou id have college hostels\nas competition encourages resource and\nself-reliance; I.C. would therefore,\nthrive. In the hostels as planned\nit would be the aim of each Warden\nto get hostel loyalties and eventually\nPresidents of Hall would appear4 to\nthe detriment of I.C. Mr. Royee pointed out that\nconstituent collage hostels would\nlead to ragging, broken furniture\nand obscene drawing, enough to turn\nthe Rector into a sleepless Knight.\nMr. P feff er from the floor\nwaffled around the proposition and\nopposition and advised the Onion to abstain. It had been stated by the\nRector that there would be no inter hostel sport and inmates would *S distributed by ballot thus no hostel\nloyalty would be created.\nApart from a few red herrings\nlike Imperial Oniversity and the\nCambridge system no new matter was\nbrought up from the floor. However\nconcern was expressed for the existence of I.C. and the constituent\ncolleges.\nThe motion wa3 lost by 46 votes\nto 55 with 25 abstentions.\nCONVOCATION ELECTION\nElected to Standing Committee of\nConvocation at the January meeting in Senate House:\nDr. L.E.C. Hughes, B. Sc. (Eng).,\nPh.D.,a graduate of Imperial College\n-and later a Recognised Teacher. As\nChairman of the Social Sub-Committee of\nConvocation he has organised nine of\nthe annual Conversaziones.\nOleo-pali as Meedle\nImperial College, the College\nof men, is imprinted on the minds of\nstudents of London University. On\nbeing told that there are a few women\nstudents, 88 in all, they immediately\nimagine the \"blue stocking\" and \" jolly hookey sti ok\" type, attempting to compete with the men on and off the\nfield.\nThis impression is also held by\nthe majority of students at I.C. The\nwomen belong to an Association whose\nmembers are considered to be un approach able, scheming, unattractive females.\nIn fao t, they're I.C. W.A.I. C.W. A. Keep out j This cry of former years is now almost an echo along the third\nfloor corridor of the hostel.\nPerhaps it i3 due to the increase in numbers which both sexes have welcomed\nWe have realised that the mens at ti tude has changed and they are slowly\nrecognising the tremendous support we give\nto the College. (This is not a column of appraisal but a plea to the few students who still condemn the\nwomen at I.C.) In return members of the Union\nhave rendered many services to I. C.W. A., who wish to recognise these ser vio es in the election of Mr. I. C.W. A. Many\nnominations have been received but\nhow many of these are serious and\nappropriate will be discovered at the\nnext General Meeting of I. C.W. A., to be\nheld early in March.

LUDLAM.\nCONTINUED FT'OM FRONT PAGE\nSOCC\u00a3P COP\nEarlier in the afternoon the two\nteams had trotted out onto the pitch to\na great roar of welcome from the large\ncrowd of supporters, in which I.C. students far outnumbered Kings. The\ntwo sides lined up along the centre\nline to be presented to Professor Sir David Hughes-Parry, >C.,M.A., L1.D.,D. C.L., Director of the Institute of\nAdvanced Legal Studies and Chairman\nof the University .AlJiletiO: Ground\nCommittee, and after the National\nAnthem the game began in almost ideal\nconditions.\nThe experienced I.C. eleven,\ncontaining ten players who have\nappeared for University teams, settled\ndown much more quickly tha.:, their\nopponents, and caused the Kings defence\nmuch trouble by feeding their extremely\ndangerous wingers with a stream of long\npasses. However, the goals did not\ncome and gradually Kings were allowed\nto come more and more into the game,\nbut were un file to burst through the\nsolid1.0. defence j. On one occasion\na goal was only pi-even ted by Dytham\nkicking off the line. After the interval, I.C. really began to get on top with both wingers\nbeing continually set in action by their\nteam mates, and only a great display\nby the Kings goalkeeper prevented a score before Pritchard performed his\ngreat deed. This gave the team a tremendous boos*', and from then on\nKings were subjected to continuous\npressure, which was encouraged by a powerful roar of \"I. C.,I.C.,I. C.,\" from the touch line. The second\ngoal came when Coups forced the ball home and the same player began the move\nfor the tl li rd by breaking away down the\nright j wing. \"His centre was met by\nCrawley whose shot was only partially3 a ved and Casemore was on the spot\nto complete the scoring. On several\nother occasions the forwards very\nnearly added to the score, and once\nCoups hit a weak goal-kick with a tremendous first time shot which produced a magnificent save from the\nkeeper.\nAfter the final whistle I.C. skipper, Dai Joyce, his ambition now\nachieved, triumphantly led his team up\ninto the stand to be presented with the\nCup. Every member of the team had\nplayed his heart out in this great\nperformance, and had so worthily earned\nthe medals they received from Prof. Sir David Hughes-Parry. Finally the team\nlifted their skipper aloft with the Cup,\nand carried him into the changing rooms\nto the a ccc rrr pani ment of the cheers of\nthe I.G. Supporting contingent, to all of whom the club would like to extend\nits thanks for their encouragement.\nThen while the crowd dispersed to the\nbar or back to I.C. by coach, train, or on the two mascots \"BO\" and \"JEZ\",\nthe team celebrated their success by\ndrinking from the Cup. Later the\nteam returned with the Cup to I.C. where it is hoped that it will remain\nfor many years, in company with the\nrugby Cup for which I.C. play Kings\nin a fortnights time.\nRECTORS CUP\nMINES\nThis year, for the first time, the\nentry was limited to two boxers in each\nweight from each College. This natura ll y led to the cream of the talent\nbeing brought forward and a more balanced\nprogramme.\nAo lose contest was forecast from\nthe start and the evening lived up to its expect ions. Minesraen were\nresplendent in dinner-jackets and cigars\nand the Guildsmen (probably saving\ntheir dress shirts far the Engineer's Ball th d next evening) were more\nmodestly dressed. (Two prominent\nGuildsmen appeared in cloth caps and\nmufflers j). The entire audience was\nenthusiastic and very alive to the\nsport inside the ring and outside too.\nVocal and mu sio al( trumpets and\nbugles) support was much in evidence.\nUntil the very end the so ores were\nabsolutely level. Before the finals were boxed only one point separated\nthe three Colleges. The eventual\nresult put Mines and Guilds (who won\nlast year) even with 43 points each,\nand RCS a shade behind with 39 points.\nThis does not give an indication of\nthe quality of the individual bouts,\nsome of which ware very close indeed.\nSeveral dark horses~were brought\nto light and this augers well for the\nI.C. team next year. The standard of\nboxing was due to the efforts of the\nteam captains and the I.C. trainer.\nAnother innovation\nwas the award of a cup\nfor the best loser which\nwas very kindly presented\nby the Club's President ,\nO.C. Seaford Esq. It was won by J. Fairfield of Mines. Another Minesman P. Mousset-Jones\nwas voted the best sty-list in the competition.\nIt is very difficult to pick the best bouts of\nthe evening. The memorable highlights were:\na few rousing battles;\nWronski vs. Bridges, Tine\nvs. Ebsworth, Owen vs.\nCox, Miller vs. Lance;\nalso the stylised fists of Mousset-Jones and the\ncool efficiency of Yorke\nand Faulkner. Many of the losers too ought to be congratulated upon the\nplucky display they pro-vi ded. TIE WITH\nGUILDS\nThe individual Champions were:\nFlyweight P. Sribhibhadh\nBantamweight H. Kirpalani\nFeather weight A. Cox\nLightweight D. Young\nLight welterweight... G. Yorke\nWelterweight L. Williams\nLight middleweight. T. Banks\nMiddleweight. P. Mousset-Jones\nLight heavyweight P. Vine\nHeavyweight C. Wronski\nIn conclusion the Club would like to thank the gentlemen of the L.A.B. A. for the hard work they did in judging\nand refereeing the bouts. We should\nlike to thank Dr. Weale for giving\naway the prizes. John Bramley waa a masterful com per e and his handling of the audience a display of p luo k and\nscience in itself. Also the seconds\nwho worked in the two corners for so\nlong and with such efficiency. Those\nwho helped to organise the evening can\nfind no words sufficient to thank Mr.\nHenry for the splendid job he did in organising the officials and boxers.\nAnd to those who came to watch our\nthanks for making it a successful\nevening.\nSWIMMING\nLast Saturday the I.C. swimming\nand water polo teams went down to Bristol for a match with Bristol University.\nUnfortunately Bristol oo ul d only field one man in each event so we put two\nsingle-string teams in the swimming\nevents. The result was a win far the\nI.C. first strings with 23 points to Bristols 15 points and I.C. second\nstrings 10 points.

    "content": "FELIX\nCROSSCOUNTRY. The most important event during the\npast fortnight was the S.W. E.T.C. Trophy Raoe on 11th Feb. This race is\na London Colleges Championship, run\nover a4 i mile course, partly in Epping Forest and partly on roads.\nI.C. entered three teams and these\nfinished l3t,4 th and lj th. The winning\nof this Trophy was a fine perform an oe, as U.C. had held it for 4 years. We\nalso provided the individual winner\nin John Collins, who finished 30\nsees, ahead of Mitchell (U.C.) and Mead\n(Q.M. C.). The I.C. team was completed\nby Cleator (4th), Jaeger (6th), Briggs\n(9th) and Brown (15th); M. Barber,\nrunning for the second team, came 7th, so that I.C. actually had 5 men in the\nfirst nine positions.\nThe following Saturday, on our\nhome course, our first team defeated\nthe Metropolitan Polioe, and our second\nteam lost to Brentwood School but\nmanaged to beat Old Brentwoodians.\nThe outstanding performances in this\nmatch were those of 0. Gilbert and M. Barber, who finished 2nd and 3rd. On Feb. 18th, I.C. fielded two\n'A' teams of equal strength, one to\nrun against Q.M. C., the other to run\nagainst L.S. S. and King's. There\nwas thick fog on the Q.M. C. course, and\ndue to their Captain getting lost and\ntaking three of our men with him, we\nnarrowly lost the race by 25 pts. to 30\n(rather good tactics!t) The individual winner was John Collins, who\nfinished 4 mins ahead of the next man.\nThen o a me James (4th), Sandoz (7th) Smith (8th), and Huntley \u00a3l0 th). Our other team beat L.S.E., but\nnarrowly lost to King's71,I.C.76 and\nL.S.E.88. Our scoring men were Tilly\n(6th), Warren (7th), Briggs (9th), Rayment ( ll), Clare (12), Cheeney (14)\nand Barker (17).\nLast Saturday (21st Feb) the I.C. first team lost to Aylesbury A.C., but\ndefeated Deptford Park A.C., while the\nsecond team again defeated Pearl\nAssurance. J. Cleator was first I.C. man home (5th) in the excellent time of\n28 rains 56 s. Ihe I.C. team also\ncomprised Bernard and Brown (equal\n8th), Tilly (10), Gilbert ( ll), and\nWarren (15). In the second team Rob\nCheeney improved his personal best time\nby more than a minute.\nHYDE PARK ROAD RELAY\nTomorrow, 28th Feb., is the date\nof the Eleventh Hyde Park Road Relay,\nwhich will be started by Brian Hewaon\nat 3 p.m. at the West end of Rotten Row.\nThe rao e is larger than ever before,\nas 64 teams have 30 far entered, so\nthat at least 384 athletes will be\ncompeting. We believe thi3 is now\nthe largest Relay race in this country,\nand probably in the world.\nFavourites to win the Sir Roderick\nHill Cup are Loughborough College, but\nit is impossible to forecast who will\ntake second place. This is traditionally the position occupied by Imperial\nCollege, but many other teams will\nattempt to displace them. Durham the\nnew U. A.U. Champs should do well.\nRUGBY\nON TO FINAL I.C. once again meet Kings in the\nfinal of the U.L. Cup, having beaten Wy<50 in the semi-final on February 11th. The game, played at Wye, was unexpectedly long and hard fought, and it wasn't until the second ten minutes of\nextra time that I.C. managed to score\nto the great relief of the large number\nof enthusiastic supporters.\nIn the first half the expected\nsuperiority in the scrum did not\nmaterialise, and play was very even,\nwith a slight advantage to Wye who had\nthe slope.\nIn the second half, although I.C. seemed to be pressing harder, several\ndangerous breaks were made by Wye's competent backs, but no side managed\nto score.\nTwenty minutes extra time, having been previously agreed upon in the event of a tie, was played. I.C. managed to hold off Wye's last down-hill challenge and in the second ten\nminutes the I.C. backs showed their\ntrue form when an outside break by\nTony Seed with the ball quickly along\nthe line put Paul Buet over the line\nin the left hand corner. Dai Phillips\nproduced a magnificent kick to put I.C5 points up. From that moment onwards the true I.C. superiority in the\nscrum showed and for the last five\nminutes 10t> \u00a3 possession of the ball\nfrom the line out made the I.C. victory certain.\nBoth the team and the now hoarse\nI.C. supporters spent a very enjoyable\nevening in Wye leaving the GEORGE at\n10.30 under the watchful eyes of the\nwhole Wye police force.\nWithout the wonderful support\ngiven to the team by the I.C. spectators the result may well have\nbeen different. We look forward to\nseeing them at Motspur Park for the\nfinal on Saturday, March 4th. ICWSC\nThe only match played in the last\nfort ni j^ it was a squash match against\nKings. After having lost JaW at\nthe beginning of the term, I.C. W.S.C. turned the tables to win convincingly\nby 4 matches to one. Of the 8 matches\nplayed against the 1st teams from\nother colleges this season I. C.W.C. have won 5, a very good second.\nr1 CRICKET I ATTENTION OF ALL PEOPLE INTENDING TO\nPLAY CRICKET THIS YEAR is drawn to notices posted on the Cricket Club notice\nboard (which adjoins the Bar), giving\nfull details of the Club's activities\nand arrangements for trials.\nThe I.C. team will be chosen from\nthe following:-J. Collins, M. Barber, A. Larkum,\nJ. Cleator, J. F. Jaeger, 0. Gilbert\nand D. Briggs.\nHelp is needed with the work\nir vol ved in running this race, and with\nthe Crosscountry Club Dance in the\nUnion in the evening. YoIu\u00abicc rc should apply to Dave Briggs (Relay\nOrganiser) or to G.P. Tilly( C.C. Captain).\nOn the following Saturday the\n1st XV played O. M.T.'A' in a mood\nof anticlimax and won 12-0 after a rather disappointing game. Last\nSaturday they lost their 3rd game\nof the season, 6-9, rather surprisingly to a good R.A.F. Farnboro'\nside, the 2nd XV win ang320. The \"Bards\", fresh from their convincing win over the Kerchsjit Taylors,\ncrushed a powerful Harrow XV at Harlington last Saturday. The forwards dominated a rugged pack battle and, with\nexcellent service from the base of the\nscrum, the free scoring backs, combining\naggression with a rock-solid defence,\ncontained the opposition within their\nown 25 for the major part of the game.\nThe team, well led as U3ual from\nthe pack by Dave Titley and inspired by\nthe re- appearance of ex-captain Bill Shakespeare (The Bard), showed a consummate skill which bodes well for their\nfuture match against the 'B' XV on the\nmorning of the Cup match, March 14th. The result: The Bards 23 pts\nHarrow 0 pts\nScored: Jim (2), Jack, Bill Big\nBike, Terry, Ginger,\nSlim Jim (1 conversion)\nMissed: Rush ( 4 conversions!)\nHOCKEY The fortunes of the Hockey Club\nhave unfortunately taken a turn for the\nworse. The 1 st XI after losing only\none match last term, have won only three\nof their eight matches this term. Our\ndefeat in the semi-final of the U.L. Gup\nby U.G.(40) was a bitter disappointment. The margin of the defeat was\nsomewhat harsh, as two goals were scored\nafter we had lost full-bic k Macrae*\nthrough injury. \"\n,\n'\ne did r. ot take early\nopportunities and were defeated by the\nbetter team (on the day).\nInjuries and illness are two of the\nreasons far the toss of form. Another\nmay be summed up in the phrase \"nothing\nsucceeds like success\". Last term we\nwere riding on the crest of a wave; w* had beaten Battersea in the cup end\nwere going from win to win, This\nterm started with frustrating can ce Hat ions broken only by defeat on a frozen pitch. There is still time to\nbreak out of this vicious circle, and\nend the season on a winning note.\nNow, as you probably all know, Jim\nCarter, our vociferous and ebullient\ngoalkeeper, is enlivening a hospital\nward with a broken ankle. ?fe wish you\na speedy recovery Jim.\n\n"
