    "content": "- 10 -LONDON UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC CHAMPIONSHIPS.\nAt the end of the Union lounge you' ll find another gap -this time the Rose berry Cup for athletics is the defaulter. It has passed to Kings, so we shall probably never hear the last of it'. Things never looked too bright from the Wednesday evening when, although Jarvis gave us a2nd in the mile walk and Whitlock came 3rd. in the3 miles( in good time), Kings produced the winner of each. Brookman and Goldhawk got 3 rd and 5 th respectively in the discus and Bean managed a5 thin the hammer, but how we missed Fred Martin in these events. On Saturday hopes of remaining champions were slim but not extinct and a fine effort by Smithies to finish2 nd in the440y ds hurdles on his second run over that distance set the standard but the points only came slowly. George and Townend filled the last two places in the100 and. Watts beat the latter into4 th place in the220; Wind le seemed off form in the830, finishing5 th, but Gillett' s4 thin the120y ds hurdles equalled the I.C. record. A few Inches cost Brookman the javelin first place and Whitlock ran easily into3 rd in the steele chase. Need we add that Tony Watts\noccupied, his traditional place behind Wint In the quarter he\nprobably dreams of that view! IMPERIAL COLLEGE ATHLETIC SPORTS 1950.\nOn this grey day the I.C. stars of track and field shone\nbrightly. as they competed for the Imperial College Governors'\nChallenge Shield for their constituent colleges. The trophy, dim\nand dusty, had earlier been transported from its niche in the Union, by courtesy of London Transport, and via a circular tour of Walham\nGreen, to Motspur Park. Boanerges, that mascot of mascots, having spurned the R.C.S. drum outside the Union, but complete with Spanner, had already completed its course to the track. At this annual event, tactics in deployment of strength count for more than a few spectacular victories, hence the longstanding of some of the records. One, however, that fell again after only two years was that for the half mile, won by C.J, Windle,\nex Public Schoolboys Half Mile Champion, In2 mins,0.6 sec s.Windle later laid the foundation for the record breaking Mile Relay time of 3mins.43.4 secs. by returning2 mins.3,6. secs for the half mile. A,B. Watts clinched the matter with a52.4 secs. quarter at the end. The Guilds team thus had a grandstand view\nof the battle for second place between R.C.S. and Mines.\nThe meeting was visited early on by an intrepid airman\nwho might have been better employed cheering his side from the rails. The Judo Club exhibition, commentated on in the Carroll Gibbons style( \"Hullo Everbuddy\") atleast provided the long sought answer to the question as to which bone was connected to the shoulder bone. The events in general were coaxed, along most ably and wittily by the commentators.\nSince about 500 people attended the meeting, individual results will be quite well known, and we shall give only the final scores: G.&G.113 points, R.S. M.96,R.C. S.62. ERRATA.\nWe apologise for a mistake in our Editorial on page 1.\nThe Beer Improvement Sub-Committee In fact consisted of two\npeople, Col. Sheppard and D.C. Howe, and it was quite incorrect to refer to Derek as its chairman. We have also been guilty of ambiguity on page 6. It is Reg. Gill who is engaged, not Felix. "

    "content": "THE REFECTORY.\nBy a Felix Reporter, In the last issue of Felix, the Editorial expressed the\ndiscontent of the students with the latest increase in Refectory prices, and it is evident that a fuller explanation of the\nincreases is required than that given in the pamphlet issued by the Refectory Committee. It is hoped that this article will enable students to make a better appraisal of the situation by giving them the important facts, It is already well known that the Refectory was running at a considerable loss \u00a33,451 last year, and at a similar rate this year, and that the Governors could not continue to meet this loss. The basic reason for the loss Is the fluctuations in demand which occur In a partially resident al college; fluctuations of numbers, with a small number of breakfasts and\nsuppers, and a large number of lunches; fluctuations in quality, in that a higher standard of meals and service is required for college functions, like club dinners and Dinner in Hall; and\nheavy fluctuations in that the place Is busy for30 weeks In the year, fairly slack for14 weeks and very slack for8 weeks.\nAn organization that can meet these requirements must inevitably be less efficient than a normal catering establishment, although this loss of efficiency is partly offset by the lower overheads.\nIn their consideration of how to balance their budget,\nthe Committee has assumed that there can be. no lowering of\nrequirements or standards, and since the staff is considered to be the minimum necessary to meet the requirements, there could therefore be no economy by cutting the number of staff or cost of food. Actually, two minor economies have been made\nhere: it was found that one of the cleaners on the Refectory payroll worked elsewhere in the College most of the time, and\nher wages have been transferred to College Administration; also the usual trading discounts had not been obtained on some\nitems of food, and these have now been negotiated. A very substantial saving has been achieved by introducing a system of \" laying off\" staff during vacations. Retainers will be paid as a lump sum at the end of the \" layoff\" periods, these being considered a necessary incentive to the staff. returning. The year has been divided into periods at which it is estimated to be economic to employ certain numbers of staff an\nadequate warning will be given to those to be \" laid off.\" This quite drastic reorganization will effect a saving of\nabout \u00a32,000 a year, but there will still be a deficit estimated at \u00a31,600. There appeared to be no way of reducing this by\nfurther reorganization, and the Committee therefore reluctantly decided that prices would have to be increased. The distribution of price increases is well known, also that consideration was made of the fact that vacation meals\ncontribute largely to the loss. It may, however, be of interest to give the estimated yield from the increases: surcharge on\nfunctions \u00a3200, vacation meals \u00a3600, breakfasts and suppers \u00a3300\nand lunches \u00a3500.\nThese, then, are the salient facts. If anyone has any\nsuggestions to make the Committee would be glad to receive them.\nThey (the suggestions) should be dropped in the suggestions box\nin the Union, preferably this week-end, as the Committee are\nmeeting on Monday,\nThe Dilemma.\nThere used to be a saying that an apple a day keeps the\ndoctor away. An apple now costs five pence and the doctor nothing. "

In the course of a week,\nthree matches and a competition still left adequate opportunity for other things, and thanks to our hosts, I' Ecole des Hautes Etudes\nCommerciales, and. to the members of the Clubs we visited, a good\ntime was had by all. The highlight of the visit was the 'Challenge Ma bile an1, an international foil competition which provided some of the best fencing to be seen today, and which, incidentally, was\nrounded off rather pleasantly by the presentation to l'E qu l ped' Imperial College de Lond res, amongst others, of a case of4 bottles of champagne for taking part a liard ice session until the early hours adequately disposed of those S Our match against the H.E. C. was very close, resulting in a win for our opponents by one fight. Wholesale hissing by the spectators from time to time was rather disconcerting until we\nrealised it was meant as a compliment, but champagne after the match more than made up for this Initial misunderstanding. Matches against the Cercle d 'Escrime de Paris and the Racing Club de France also provided good practice, although both were\nlost to more experienced teams.\nHowever, by the end of our stay, we too had gained experience and it was generally agreed that there' s something very pleasant about Paris in the spring you'd never guess what.\nPutney Amateur Regatta. Cn Saturday,13 th May, in brilliant sunshine and with a stiff cross following v/ ind off the Middlesex shore, the I.C. First Junior Eight laid the foundations of a revival for I. C.rowing. The First& Second Junior Eights had been entered, the former for Junior Eights and the latter for Junior Clinker Eights, The Second Juniors were perhaps somewhat unlucky in being beaten by the eventual winners of the event In their heat. All the same, their rowing typified the errors into which I, C,rowing as a whole has fallen. An almost complete lack of beginning a hoi ck through at the finish and a consequent forcing away of the hands,\nwhich leaves the crew with little or no time to prepare for a true beginning. Every crew which bases its rowing on the teachings of the immortal Steve must realise that a quick, hard beginning, the blade locked up In the water at the moment- of entry by a quick flex of the arms and carried through by a drive off the stretcher with both legs is the first essential from which the rest will follow naturally without need of being forced. The First Juniors had the right idea and made no mistake in winning their heat. In the final, though perhaps a little rougher,\nthey were looser and more lively and commanded a higher rating. After a good fight they lost to a. good London R.C. eight, who 'showed\nclearly that the finish of the stroke is really only the end of the beginning. \"Through in one piece\" in fact, "

ODE Oil INTIMATIONS Of IMMORALITY.\nThere was a maiden, so demure,\nSo staid and nice, so chaste and pure.\nHer mind was free from base desire; Her thoughts were on the plane that' s higher; With skirt pulled primly o 'er her knees,\nWhen on this plane she feared no breeze. No wolf could brave this Gorgon'3 glance;( She stayed inside when at a dance). There was a maiden so demure;\nBut I'm afraid I never knew ' er. There is a maiden so assured; Her way of life's to be deplored,( I can't say why - it's not allowed). She's apt to giggle out quite loud When sitting on a Hyde Park seat. Her skirt and neckline almost meet\nA girl who's loose, and often tight( Particularly late at night). There i_s_ a maiden so assured; And do I know ' er? Oh, my Gawd!\nD. G. Randall,\nMatters of Moment,\nThe lists are now up in the I.C. Union lounge for the nominations of I.C. Council representatives, two from each-college, and for the Entertainments Committee. The lists will close on 2 9 th May, and the elections will take place at the Annual Union General Meeting on 1 st June.\nThe lists will also soon be up for the nomination of next year's President, who will be elected by Council on June 8 th. We urge everyone to give these elections their serious attention, for on them the future wellbeing of the Union will largely depend.\nMatters of Little Moment.\nWe \"understand that an unprecedented interest has been\ntaken in the Photographic Society since a very interesting notice appeared on their noticeboard outside the bar,( The\nEditor will be pleased to consider any photographs that may\nbe submitted to him, but cannot undertake to print them).\nThe Discovery II( see our last issue) is reported to have\nbeen held up by, amongst other things, a pair of trousers in the funnel. The I.C. men on board evidently find that old habits diehard. We were pleased to see that in a recent article on\nUniversity slang, The Observer very properly credited I.C. with the invention of the term \"brown-b agger\" on account of his inseparable devotion to his briefcase. Matters of Big Moments.\nOff the record: Reg. Gill has kept his secret well. Felix now lets the cat out of the bag he has been engaged since February. We offer our congratulations to Mary Mayer and Bob Re ave ll who were married during the Easter vac. Likewise to Paul D lg by, Frank Shepherd and David Shore, who have also taken the plunge.

    "content": "- 5 -Profile: DEREK HOWE.\nPew men at Imperial College can be so well known as D,C, Howe. Why then this profile? He is a prominent member of the\nI.C. Union Council, he is known to Guildsmen as their Union President, to the Hockey Club as a centre half, to supporters of the bar as a reliable( though always sober) supporter, and\nto Hostel residents as a late break faster. But it is not the\npurpose of this profile merely to catalogue his activities: rather to attempt a more unofficial portrait of one who has\ngiven much time and effort to the wellbeing and smooth running\nof I.C. After leaving school Derek casually studied some engineering to keep a friend company. Living at Portsmouth it was natural that he should join the Navy when the time came and the Navy\nwere pleased to send him severally to Cambridge, Loughborough\nCollege and the R,N. Engineering College to train him. After these preliminaries he joined a Fleet Air Arm Sqdn, on the\nImplacable at Belfast; a trip round the British Isles and before long he was landed at Pompey and de mobbed. To continue with engineering was the obvious thing to do though he confesses\nthat he had always wanted to be an actor or a writer. His\nsuccesses as the former with the I,C. Dram.Soc. leave no doubt\nas to his capability in that direction. 'During the winter,' he said,' I 'decide to be an actor every other week.' Of past\nI,C. productions the role he most enjoyed was that of 'Dr. Knock'\n( Christmas,1948); he has the ambition to play Henry V, 'Just\nbefore a production,' said Derek, ' its sheer agony. I quake\nand quaver and forget my lines. But once the play has opened\non its first night I enjoy every minute of it.' All his activities are, as it were, communal ones; he abjures such\nantisocial and vicious hobbies as stamp collecting or patience. He finds more pleasure in people than in things, a sentiment\nwhich Is reflected, in his ability to meet and mix with any and\neveryone,\nI asked Derek how he felt about the frock coat( see\nEditorial, p.l.), He was quite lyrical\\ In fact he approves\nof brighter clothes for men - only wishes he dared to dare a red waistcoat and a yellow cap - so is glad to have some ' official' excuse for sartorial extravagance. On I.C. matters, Derek\nexpressed the wish that more speakers at Union meetings would\ntake their courage and humour in both hands and speak their mind - be it grave or gay - for the edification or entertainment\nof the meeting. More colour and more dash were needed. 'I' mall for pomp and circumstance and spectacle though not to the\nexclusion of humour or spontaneity.' In respect of rags, Derek\nthinks that the best were often spontaneous - but we ought\nnot to neglect the idea of a great procession and an organised rag for charity this last providing both the excuse and the\nmeans of obtaining more license from the police. An epicure, Derek assured me that with diligence it was\npossible to find really good food in London without spending\na fortune.' I regard good eating as one of the chief physical joys of life,' he said, Derek Howe is indeed a man of many\nparts. Guilds President, sportsman, committee man, orator, oarsman, actor and engineer. And. but for Derek neither this nor any other profile would have been written FELIX itself owes Its conception and infant nurture to him.\nC.M. H. Attention, Future Presidents. At the risk of displaying our ignorance as deplorably: as the\nF resident, we offer the following as a free translation of the\nCollege motto:- \" Science is the Glory and Shield of the Empire.\"\n\n"

    "content": "No. 8 . IMPERIAL GOLLEQE , /9 MAY i950. EDITORIAL,\nPomp and Circumstance. At a recent meeting of the C.&G. Union, a motion was\npassed deploring the President's common mode of attire, and\ndecreeing that on official and semi official occasions he\nwear a frock coat of the old Guilds blazer material. Similarly the R.C.S. Union have decided that the august person of their President should be clothed In a top hat on these occasions. A similar motion was very properly defeated in the R.S. M. Union last term - we say properly, because the motion smacked\nof frivolity, and the ceremonial dignity of our Presidents is not a matter that should be treated lightly. This reawakening of a proper sense of the true splendour\nof these exalted positions is to be welcomed by all of right mind. The world to-day is drab, and the colour of official pomp does much to alleviate its monotony. Let us therefore have more of this sartorial brilliance; let the Guilds complete the costume with a grey top hat; let the R.C.S, clothe the body of their President in a garb becoming his headgear; and. let the R.S. M. clothe their President in such\nsplendid plumage as to put to shame all those of humble\nhabit. What, then, of the President of Imperial College? If his mere flunkeys are to be thus gorgeously attired, what\npossible apparel could match the true majesty of his exalted office? We regard as frivolous the suggestion that, after the Union had unanimously deplored, his ignorance of the meaning\nof the College motto, that a dunces cap would be most apt. This matter evidently merits the most serious consideration by the Union's ablest brains. It seems likely that nothing less will suffice than a full suit of armour, with lance and\nplumed helmet, a white charger and a shield inscribed with the College crest with the motto translated. A FEW KIND WORDS.\nIn our last Editorial we were so busy saying unkind things about the Refectory Committee that we forgot to give them the\npat on the back that they deserve. The beer in the bar may\nnow be drunk with real pleasure, for it is an excellent fine ale. Congratulations to the Beer Improvement Sub-Committee,\nChairman Derek Howe, for their fine achievement.\nA word of praise, too, to the Entertainments Committee\nfor adopting our suggestion of a second bar for Saturday\nnight hops .\n\n"

The local inhabitants are usually warned in advance and prepare themselves for the eight weeks to follow. On the whole a hearty welcome is given to the visitors from England and the neighbouring inns and public houses check\nover their stocks of liquid refreshment, Eerhaps to call the arrival there this year an invasion would be as light overstatement, for the Mines Carnival was barely over when the coach and twenty, followed by an odd assortment of\nvehicles, set off from South Kensington with loads of sufferers bound for the West. Recovery was swift in the sea breeze, but it was a full month before anyone dared to admit that things seen\nthrough a theodo lite telescope appeared upside down.\nTywarnhale Mine was an important copper producer until fifty years ago when it closed down and was taken over by the\nRoyal School of Mines. Since then scores of R.S. M. men have been\ntrained there in surface and underground surveying and the present course is organised to give a thorough understanding of practical mine surveying obtained in a hardworking but almost holiday like atmosphere. Work on the surface and underground is sensibly arranged as far as possible to suit the elements but this year's weather - \" th'w or rst for thirteen years\" was a different proposition and many got wet.\nThe ol u stone power house and long wooden hut which serves as a \"dry\" are pointed to with pride by the Porthtowan villagers who refer to them as \"The\" Royal School of Mines. Rumour has it that someone on oe wrote requesting to be shown over so that he\nmight compare it with the Camborne School of Mines' buildings. It is considered that Camborne would have lost the verdict by\na short head.\nSporting activities may be summed up as three rug ger, two\nsoccer and a billiards match lost; one darts and one squash match\nwon. Most of the pubs between Plymouth and Land's End were looked Into and among other places of Interest visited were Helston( on Flora Day), The Victory( on any day), the Camborne drill hall, the Redruth ambulance hall, St. Ives and the Camborne drill hall and the Redruth ambulance hall and the Camborne drill hall, A pleasant little Interlude occurred one evening in April when the third year miners, down in Camborne on a two week rock drilling course, threw a party. Surveyors and rock drillers combined to make the occasion a happy one and. the main results were one policeman convinced that he was not up to\" B\" Division standard and many early morning arrivals at the Camborne School of Mines shocked to see their flagpole capped, by a china utensil, A few such incidents lingered in the memory as we\neventually 'worked our way back to civilization.
