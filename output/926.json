I introduced myself\nand sharp grey crags. It is a land and asked about the jeep to Gupis\nwhere frantic streams weave across the following day. Nazir smiled,\nthe earth like veins of quartz and exposing a few lonely teeth, and\nalong their paths they have carved promised that the next day he would\ndeep valleys into the yielding rock. send me to Gupis for 60 rupees.\nIn mid-October of last year, as a Inshallah.\nDemons and Stones\nPeter Wright\nexplores stone\ncircles in\nnorthern\nPakistan\npart of an expedition to investigate\nthe Mongol Empire and its legacies,\nI found myself deep within this\nstark and isolated world. Here, in\nthe small town of Gilgit, in a cramped and musty bookshop on\nthe bazaar street, I came across a certain book. Written in the 1890s by a British Army Colonel, John\nBiddulph, it was a personal survey\nof the north of Pakistan and its\npeople. In one chapter was a lively\ndescription and accompanying\nillustration of an ancient stone circle\nin the region of a village called\nGupis, a day's journey from Gilgit.\nAlways one to be intrigued by the\nmysterious, I set out to find them.\nI was told by my hotel manager\nthat Nazir, a shopkeeper with a store on Gilgits Punial Road, had\na cargo jeep going to Gupis the\nfollowing day. So I went to find\nhim.\nHe was an old willowy man with\na large hooked nose and yellow y white hair that stuck out from below\nThe next morning, at 8.00am,I walked up the damp road to Nazir's shop. The sky above was an\nunbroken grey into which the\nsurrounding mountains gradually\ndissolved. Nazir was again sitting\non the floor of his shop. He was\nwriting receipts for the boxes and\nsacks which were then loaded into\nthe back of the ancient blue jeep\nparked outside. Judging by the weld\nmarks on the body, it looked like\nthe jeep had broken completely in\nhalf at least twice before.\nThe driver came into the shop,\nshook my hand vigorously and told\nme to come back at 10.00am as he\nhad to have some more work done\non the jeep.\nAs it turned out we didn't actually\nleave until 3.30pm. Nazir blamed\nthe delay on 'stupid engineers'. I'm sure he had one less tooth this time.\nThe back of the jeep was packed\nlevel with cargo up to the cab roof\nand I shared an unstable perch up\nthere with three others. As we\nfollowed the dirt road into the\nmountains along the Gilgit River I passed around the bag of walnuts\nthat Nazir had given me. In the\nfading light the river seemed like a fallen ribbon of the dark sky lying\nacross the valley floor below. The\nmountains reared up around us and\nwe travelled in the trough of some\nmonstrous frozen wave. As it began\nto rain they lost their sharpness and\nthe darkness became absolute.\nOur headlights cut white cones\ninto the driving rain and the four of\nus huddled together on the pile of\ncement bags and filing cabinets in\nthe back of the jeep. We were cold,\nwet and sore. In front of us, picked\nout in staccato black and white,\nstood an old Bailey bridge. It\nstraddled a river that was invisible\nbelow us in the swirling black. The\nbridge was barely a skeleton, with\nonly a metal girder chassis\nremaining. As we inched over it,\nour wheels slipping on the wet\nbeams with impervious strips of\nnight and the roaring noise of\nunseen water between them. There\nwas a crash followed by the squeal\nof rubbing metal and our vehicle\nlurched over to its left nearly\npitching us four into the greedy\nriver. The jeep stopped and we\ncarefully climbed down onto the\nbridge to find it resting on its axles\nwith its two left wheels hanging in\nspace. We were already halfway\nover and luckily the two right\nwheels retained their tenuous grip\non the bridge. The rain had reached\nepic proportions now and we\nslipped repeatedly as the four of us\nstruggled with our shoulders against\nthe fully laden jeep while the driver\nand his mate shouted\nencouragement from the warm cab.\nEventually we got it back on the\nbridge and set off again. It was now\nvery late and obvious that we\nwouldn't get to Gupis that night, so\nthe driver suggested that we stop at\nGakutch village. We all readily\nagreed and as we rounded the\ncorner, beyond the bulk of rock, we\nsaw the lonely light of Gakutch tea\nhouse.\nAfter a cup of glutinous ly sweet\ntea we were given c harpo ys and\nthick blankets under a large straw\nroof. There were no walls and the\nwind whistled through pulling\nstrands of rain with it. Drops of\nwater fell from the none-too-substantial roof and I had to sleep\nin a curious zig zag position with\nthe blanket over my head to avoid\ngetting soaked.\nAll through the night wild dogs\nfought in the yard outside and it was\na relief to be roused an hour before\ndawn. The rain had stopped but it\nwas icy cold as we climbed back\nonto the wet top of the jeep.\nOn the way to Gupis the driver\n\u2014 1 0 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 926 14 February 1992\nAcidic Viniculture\nDear Adam,\nMay I firstly commend you upon\nyour commitment to the defence of\nyour editorial freedom, however\nthis is only part of the job you were\nelected for and, judging by my own\nrecent experiences and those of\nothers, most notably Rocksoc (Felix\n925), perhaps your other duties\nhave been neglected somewhat. As\nwell as Felix editor, you are Print\nUnit Manager whose task it is to\nprovide a printing service for the\nclubs and societies of ICU. From\nthe start of the year the Felix\nphotocopier has been out of order\nand although its performance is not\nunder your control it is surely not\ntoo much to ask that the Manager\nof the Print Unit should organise for\nit to be fixed.\nPublicity is of prime importance\nfor clubs organising events where\nnot only their reputation but also a NatWest Again\nDear Sir,\nAfter an 'unfortunate' incident on\nJanuary 31 at the IC Nat West\nbranch, I feel obliged to write to\nyou. Every month, I transfer a cheque worth \u00a3205.00 into my bank\naccount. When this transaction is\ncompleted after authorisation by\ntelephone, I withdraw the equal\namount from my account. The sum\nis used to pay my rent.\nOn the above mentioned day, I endeavour ed to do the same. This\ntime however, my request was\nrefused by the cashier. Surprised as\nI was, I asked to see the manager\n(Mr Jamieson), who, after a fifteen\nminute wait, bluntly refused to cash\nthe cheque or give any further\nexplanation. On pointing out to him\nthat on the three previous occasions\nthere had not been any problem, he\ntold me, 'the past has nothing to do\nwith the present!'. He added that\nour lack in communication was\nprobably due to 'our difference in\nbackground (!)'. He also questioned\nmy attitude towards college in\ngeneral, of which he has no\nknowledge.\nEventually, the matter was solved\nby my paying a \u00a35 telephone\ncharge, to ensure the cheque would\nclear. The Current Account Tariff\nleaflet (published by Nat West)\nclearly states however, that this fee\nmust not be charged when a service\ncard is presented. My service card\nhad been in Mr Jamieson's hands\nfor the past fifty minutes.\nFurthermore, I was later told none\nof those charges apply to students\nanyway.\nThe whole incident was\nconducted in an insulting and\nunprofessional manner, not one you\nwould expect from a bank which\nprides itself on a positive approach\nto students, but more akin to a small-time swindler.\nI hope this charge and his\ndeliberately hostile attitude were\nentirely due to his Friday afternoon\ndesire to end business and not a reflection of his general attitude\ntowards students. Students find it\ndifficult enough to survive in\nLondon as it is, without having to\ndeal with the unsympathetic\napproach of their bank managers.\nYours faithfully,\nJ Van Hooydonck, Geology 2.\nlot of their finance is at stake.\nPeople should not have to use\nStabur Graphics yet on several\noccasions this year Guilds has had\nto resort to their services to get\nGuildsheet out in time despite you\nknowing of the print dates months\nin advance. Even when jobs are\ndelivered on time it is usually only\nthanks to constant chasing up by the\ngroup of people who need the\nmaterial.\nThe Union should have no\ncontrol of what you say in Felix,\nyou are the editor, but when people\nneed printed material in order to\npublicise or run a successful event\nthese jobs should take a higher\npriority than they appear to at the\nthe minute. When it comes to\nprinting jobs you are there to\nprovide a service for us.\nYours sincerely.\nTim Proctor.\nRockSoc Again\nAdam.\nThank you so much for printing\nPoddy's highly amusing reply to my\nletter in last week's edition. For his\ninformation I can spell puerile,\nalong with a host of other words.\nOne thing that was carefully ignored\nwas the fact that the letter was typed\nto avoid any confusion over my\n'illegible scrawl'. Although my wit\nand intelligence are as quick as they\nare sharp, alas my fingers are not\nso nimble and I am prone to the odd\ntyping error. Something you are\nquite familiar with yourselves\njudging from the amount of\nmistakes in Felix 925. Apart from\nICSF's 'Purty Tests' and Poddy's own Tngorance', you even\nmanaged to leave an f off fact in my\nown contribution. Other notable\nomissions included an explanation\nfor your( personal behaviour or the\nslightest hint of an apology. As your\nactions seem indefensible I am\ninstead subjected to a petty personal\nattack from fellow members of your\nstaff.\nTo clarify matters once and for\nall, unlike the members of Dramsoc\nand Opsoc whose actions were\nA Few Misconceptions\nDear Adam,\nI just wish to clear up a few\nmisconceptions that made\nthemselves obvious in your editorial\nrelating to the mass-removal of\nFelices by C&G in 1987.\nThe reason for their removal was\nthat Felix had made up and printed\ntheir own advert for the Guilds\nCarnival (admittedly because the\nC&G publicity team hadn't got their\narse s into gear). The tone of this\nadvert was such that, although it\nsaid that people should go, it was\nfeared that a lot of students would\nbe turned off the event; hence the\ndawn raid.\nThe news stories, to which Dave\nTyler, the then President objected\non the grounds of unfairness,\nmerely pricked at his over-inflated\nand over-sensitive ego and revenge\nfor them was not a mot ice for the\nremoval (although they may have\ncoloured his judgement).\nThe lawsuit against Felix later\nthat year had nothing to do with\nnews stories but with a column\ncalled 'Blackmail' whose author\n(Delator, where are you now?) had\ngot hold of a College Notable's stolen filo fax and had printed\nexcerpts from the diary concerning\nhorizontal athletics, Galaxy bars\nand exaggerated claims of staying\npower. The deal was that the owner\nof the filo fax should pay a ransom\nto Rag or be named. Unfortunately,\nthe notable's girlfriend's first name\nwas mentioned and its idiosyncratic\nspelling resulted in instant\nidentification; hence the lawsuit on\nthe grounds of invasion of privacy,\nhumiliation, using information\nobtained from stolen goods (Paddy\nAshdown, take note) etc. The\nmatter was settled out of court.\nOn a final note concerning\neditorial responsibility, the opinions\nexpressed in Felix may well not be\nthose of the editor, and his freedom\nfrom any external pressure over the\ncontents is sacrosanct (even UGM's have said so!), a little discretion and\nthoughtfulness on the part of the\neditor makes life run so much more\nsmoothly and free from such upsets\nconcerned with their review, our\ncomplaint is over the treatment of\nour press release. Reviews may be\nbased on opinion but a press release\nis fact. It appears that Rag are to\nreceive compensation from the\naforementioned societies for the\nloss of their main publicity resulting\nTow attendance'. Our main\npublicity was grossly mistreated, to\nthe same resulting loss, and yet\nthere appears to be no recompense\nforthcoming from Felix to cover\nour losses!\nIn reference to Poddy's further\nopinions, he is neither 'my friend'\nnor has ever met me, therefore I don't feel I need defend my music\ntastes, however varied they may be.\nPerhaps if he had bothered\nattending our event he may have\nbeen able to form some opinions\nbased on fact for a change.\nFinally. I would like to apologise\nto the readers who must be as sick\nof this affair as I am. Hopefully this\nletter will be treated in a more\nmature and sensible manner so the\nwhole matter can be brought to a long overdue close.\nAD Ham, Vice President\nIC Rock Society.\nas the events of last week. I agreed\nwith every word of the 'Grease'\nreview (having seen the show on\nThursday) but saving it for after the\nshow's run was over would have\nhurt no one, would have been\ntactful (a bad review can really mess\nup the performances of nonprofessionals as well as jeo pardi sing the success of a Union event) and\nwould have avoided last week's unpleasantness.\n'Publish and be damned' can be\nan extreme policy with extreme\nside-effects.\nYours,\nMax Kallios, Mech Eng PG (and\none-time Guilds VP).\n\u2014 2 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "14 February 1992 Felix 926 Feature\npulled up at his brother's house, a collection of rickety stone buildings\nringed by a complex maze of dry\nstone walls. We had a breakfast\nthere of cups of salt tea and greasy\npancakes soaked in cooking oil. I politely choked down the waves of\nnausea that overcame me as my\nenthusiastic host forced more and\nmore pancakes and oil down me. I was grateful when I was allowed to\nstop eating.\nA few hours later we arrived in\nthe village of Gupis, a small\nconglomeration of the usual dry\nstone huts clinging to the banks of\nthe Gilgit River. I bought the driver\nanother cup of salt tea and he\nexplained to me that he had heard\nof some stones similar to the ones\nthat I was seeking a further 10km upstream on the other side of the\nriver. I thanked him and he told me\nto be outside the village shop at\n7.00am the next morning if I wanted a lift back to Gilgit.\nI set off along the riverside road\nsurrounded by tall beech trees\ncloaked in autumnal browns and\nyellows. After a two hour walk I could see the village of Khalti on the\nopposite bank, perched on the\nnarrow shelf of land below\nprecipitous brown cliffs. The river\nhere was deep and green and wide\nand afforded the only crossing point\nfor some distance in either\ndirection. The crossing was carried\nout on a rather sorry looking raft\nbuilt from a plank of wood and two\nlorry inner tubes. It was hauled from\nbank to bank by two ropes and to\ncross the river I had first to bargain\nwith the rope puller on the other\nside. This was done by means of an\nagent who screamed my offers of\npayment over the river where they\nwere at first met with howls of\nderisive laughter. Eventually a fee\nwas agreed upon and I was floated\nunsteadily across to Khalti.\nIt took me a further hour and a half to explain to a group of curious\nvillagers what I was looking for.\nFirstly I tried drawing pictures in\nthe sand but finally succeeded by\nmaking a small model from\npebbles.\nA reluctant guide was found and\ntogether we trudged up into the\ncliffs behind the village. My guide\nspoke no English and set off at a sprint which I struggled to keep up\nwith. I felt ashamed of my Italian\nleather Vibram soled walking boots\nas he powered ahead sock less in a pair of cut off rubber Wellingtons\nseveral sizes too big.\nWe climbed to a gently sloping\nplane covered in brown sand and\nblack glazed rocks and from here\nscrambled down a loose slope of\ns cree onto the spur of land at the\nconfluence of the Gilgit and Yassin\nRivers. There stood the stone circle,\nlonely and almost daunting as the\nincessant twisting crash of the rivers\nwound around its large boulders,\nsmoothed by the constant flow of\nwater and stained brown by time.\nIt was possible to believe that the\nperfect 8 metre circle was entirely\na creation of nature, that tiny\ncurrents of water, breaths of air and\nvibrations of the ground had\nconspired over the millen i a to give\nbirth to this monument.\nIn form the circle resembled a table, the centre being solid and flat\nstones having been arranged as a top with large ones on the outside\nedge dishing down to small ones in\nthe centre of the slightly concave\nhollow. I took some pictures and\ndid a drawing but my guide was\nobviously uneasy and kept urging\nme to leave.\nAfter a further half an hour I gave\nin to my guide's, by now, frantic\nsign language and we left this\ncurious site about which nothing is\nknown except that there are similar\nones further up the Yassin Valley.\nThe locals, however, have their\nown ideas; as I was to find out later\nthat night.\nBack in Khalti I paid my guide\nand was immediately whisked off to\nthe house of Mohammed Ayub. He\nwas waiting for me as I walked into\nthe village. A tall, well built man\nin his early thirties he spoke very\ngood English and insisted that I come with him to drink tea.\nAs darkness fell I was invited to\nstay the night and accepted\ngratefully. Dinner was served next\nto the big black iron stove with the\nwhole family in attendance but only\nmyself eating. As I spoke to\nMohammed his little brothers and\nsisters ran around us shrieking and\nyelling. Mohammed explained to\nme quietly that the circle I had\nvisited was a very dangerous place\nas a powerful demon called Mirza\nKatchut lived there.

    "content": "14 February 1992 Felix 926 Clubs & Societies\nBallroom Dance Champions\nSaturday 1st February, saw the start\nof the first of the three annual\nuniversity dancing competitions.\nThe Imperial College Dance Club\ntook three teams - each team\ncontaining a waltz, cha cha,\nquickstep and jive couple - to the\nSheffield University Intervarsity\nDancing Competition held at the\nSheffield Octagon.\nAfter a coach journey made most\nadventurous by zero visibility fog\nfollowed by getting lost in the hills\nand valleys of Sheffield (I told them\nit was junction 33 but no ooo!...) we\narrived at the Octagon where we\nwere joined by 40 other university\nteams, amongst them our long time\nrivals, Cambridge and Oxford (we\nlove them really).\nFirst off were the team\ncompetitions. Imperial was the only\nuniversity in the finals of each of the\nfour dances. The waltz saw Nigel\nand Juliette to the third round, but\na commendable performance by\nNorman and Clare took them into\nthe semi-finals, where the sheer\ngracefulness of Colin and Joanne\njustified their tie for second place.\nDespite stiff competition in the\nLatin section, Pragnesh and\nLyeyen, new to the competition\nscene, survived up to the third\nround of the cha cha while a most\nwicked performance from our two\nother couples Mathew and Zoe and\nPaul and Sonia carried them to the\nfinals achieving 2nd and 3rd place\nrespectively.\nGood dancing by Joe and Sarah\nhelped them to the third round of\nthe quickstep. However, new\ncomers Peter and Susan\nquick stepped comfortably to the\nsemis, but Head and Patricia,\nthrough a smooth and enjoyable\ndance, secured third place.\nOf the five couples in the finals\nof the jive, three were from\nImperial. In a strong jive, Satin and\nLiz just missed a place in the finals\nbut a titillating show from Roger\nand Helen gave them fifth position.\nHowever a truly awe inspiring\nperformance from Alex and\nShelagh and Mark and Max\ndeservedly gained them 1st and 3rd places respectively.\nAfter a stunning demonstration\nfrom British world champions\nSammy Stopford and Barbera\nMaccall, the university knockout\ncompetition commenced. This\nsimply entailed two randomly\nchosen universities competing\nagainst each other in two randomly\nchosen dances, with the winner\nproceeding to the following round.\nImperial battled relentlessly to the\nfinal round, leaving in its path a damaged York University and\nOxford to pick up the pieces of\ndefeat. .\nIn the finals we met none other\nthan Cambridge. They stared at us\nand us at them, our feet tense and\nready for the mother of all dances.\nAnd then the shouting match\nstarted, 'Imperial', 'Cambridge',\n'Imperial', 'Cambridge', TC... but\nwhat were the dances? Waltz and\nQuickstep! We hurled Colin and\nJoanne, our strongest waltz couple,\nonto the floor and Cambridge sent\non their finest and in the blink of\nan eye it was finished. Then Head\nand Patricia glided on for the\nquickstep and it too was over in a flash - but who won? The room was\nsilent as the judges tabulated the\nscores and then it was announced...\n'The winners are Imperial\nCollege!!'.\nAt the end of the evening the\noverall results showed us barely\nlosing the C team trophy but\ncomfortably winning the B and Ateam trophies, making us the overall\nwinners. There can be no rest\nhowever as the Southern University\nCompetition is just a week away\nand Cambridge, Oxford and a dozen other hopefuls will be there\nbent on revenge. Special thanks to\nout team coaches Vicky and\nDorothy, without whom this victory\nwould not have been possible.\nLadies' Lawn Tennis Women's Cross\nSara (captain), Carol, Marianne\nand Kirsten made up the IC Ladies\nLawn Tennis team of four that were\nvirtually unrivalled in the round\nrobin area group of the U AU Championship, and qualified in\nsecond place behind Reading. Our\nfirst match in the Knock-Out stages\nwas against Bognor at home. After\nwaiting for an hour at Bishop's Park\ncourts, it was obvious that Bognor\nwere too scared to turn up. They\nmust have heard about our Saturday\npre-match training session, where\nmiraculously, all four members\nturned up for the first time ever. We\nclaimed a walk-over, thus resulting\nin our next match being away to\nCardiff, who had won their group.\nThree of us set off from South\nKensington Tube Station at 8am and\nmet our fourth player at\nPaddington. If we were feeling a little sleepy, we soon woke up at the\ncost of the train fare. Undaunted,\nwe managed to reach the tennis\ncourts with 45 minutes to spare. So\nusing our feminine charm (what\nfrom IC?) we bribed the\ngroundsman to unlock the courts so\nwe could have a little practise.\nThe opposition turned up late and\nin awe of our ability. After the 4\nsingles matches, the score in\nmatches was a22 tie, but with us\nleading 3-2 in sets. Kirsten at seed\n4 played valiantly, but lost in\nstraight sets (to who we considered\nto be their best player!). Marianne\nat seed 3, narrowly lost in a3 set\n'match of the day' battle. Carol\n(seed 2) won convincingly against\na mouth y opponent. First seed Sara\nwon in her usual style, by beating\nher opponent with ease.\nGoing into the doubles, we\nneeded to win one of the two\ndoubles matches without the loss of\na set, to guarantee winning the\nmatch. Marianne and Kirsten lost\ntheir match, but Sara and Carol\nensured victory by winning in\nstraight sets. Overall we won by\none set, 7-6. This put us through to\nthe quarter final stages.\nIf anyone wished to join the Lawn\nTennis Club, could they please\nleave their name and contact phone\nnumber in the message book on the\nUnion Office desk under Lawn\nTennis.

This was actually\nan amazing feat considering there\nwas a team at all. Imperial hasn't had a ladies team for eons. As a group, the team was relatively new\nto the circuit, but this was not\napparent to the flagging opposition.\nThe course covered a gruelling 2.75\nmiles on a windswept plateau above\nRichmond and was a test of both\nstamina and grit. However this\nproved no bar to the success of\nEdwige Pitel who came second,\nMana Raimandi who came fifth and\nKristina Sewple who came seventh\nout of a field of approximately 35.\nOn Tuesday evening (18th February) IC Chamber Orchestra\nwill be giving its first concert of the\nyear. The programme consists of\nthe 'Overture From The Magic\nFlute' by Mozart, Beethovens\nSecond Symphony and the Tuba\nconcerts by Vaughn-Williams. The\nsoloist will be Joseph Izod - a member of the symphony orchestra\nand a final year student of the Royal\nAcademy of Music.\nThe Chamber Orchestra consists\nThis is not the first time the girls\nhave been successful, since two\nweeks ago at Trent Park they again\ntasted victory. They did this by\nfinishing in 1st,3 rd and 7th places\nin the same respective order.\nIf there is anyone out there who\nfeels like jumping on the\nbandwagon of success, the team\nneeds another girl to run in the IC\norganised Hyde Park Relays (racing\naround the Serpentine) on the 15th February. There are lots of other\nexciting events happening soon as\nwell, such as a road relay at Oxford\nUniversity and even a race in Paris\nat the end of March. If anyone is\ninterested they should contact\nKristina (Chem 2) via the\nChemistry pigeon holes.\nof some thirty musicians, all of\nwhom are members of the Imperial\nCollege Symphony Orchestra.

The Big\nBronze Bap was likely to agree.\nAccording to the promo, the film\nwas an 'off beat romantic comedy\nfeaturing a cast of eccentric and\nbizarre characters'. Oh yeah? Guess\nwhose nose just grew 3 feet.\nYum! Sinus problems.\nBeing fair and looking at its\npromises,\nBizarre? Yes.\nEccentric? All right, yes.\nRomantic? As nog or two.\nComedy? Sigh,....,hum...\nAlthough it only lasts 8-9\nminutes, it seemed to drag, not a drag which would be in 17' tall\nneon letters and adjoining a grill and\ntapas bar, but a vaguely tedious,\nalright to see on the telly drag.\nThe main character is our Bob\nHoskins, Louis Aubinard, a devotional photographer who has to\nfind a model for 'The Epic Christ\non the Cross Scene' or bye bye job,\nhello unemployment and eating cat\nfood city. He finds himself standing\nin for an actor friend at a dub-over\nsession, at, get this, a porno studio,\nwacky huh? This is where the\nromance comes in, no, not the\nporno film Flame or I like it up the\nbum, oh you're so big inside me\n\u00a9Steve W! but his co-actress, Sybil\n(Natasha Richardson). Actually I much preferred her in the Ken\nRussell film Gothic, now there's a film with a good bap, breast and\nblood count, four stars, the BBB\nsays, check it out anyway. Louis\nfalls headlong for Sybil (willy long\nas well) and she for him (but not so\nmuch of the willy).\nAs the day progresses she reveals\n(oo er) her past (only her past) to\nLouis and her abortive romance to\nthe Pianist, aborted only by her\nenslavement to a diabolical\nviolinist. Argh. (This is the bit\nwhere the favour and watch come\ninto play). But, and there's where\nthe plot thickens, the Pianist is due\nThe Crucible\nSalem, Massachusets, 1662: A town of Puritans, mostly farmers\nand landowners. They live a quiet\nlife of hard work and prayer. The\nbible rules. A group of girls are\ncaught dancing in the woods at night\nwith a slave from Barbados\npractising voodoo rites. This causes\nturmoil. A court is adjourned, and\nthe accused have the choice of\nconfessing and accusing others or\nbeing hanged.\nThis is basically the story of\nArthur Miller's The Crucible,\nwhich is playing at the Young Vic\nTheatre. Although the play has lost\nits immediate topical it y McCarthy's Un-American\nActivities Committee\u2014it is still a good enough play to make you\nshiver for the cold logic with which\n\u2022 people are hanged even after the\ntrials have become an apparent\nfarce. The play is produced by the\nYoung Vic Youth Theatre\nCompany, which gives 15-25 year\nold amateurs the opportunity to\nactively learn about theatre. Not\nsurprisingly then the quality of the\nacting ranges from amazing to poor,\nbut the production's major flaw is\na sloppy direction (by Karen\nStevens and Chris White). There is\nnot enough differentiation between\nmost characters and hardly any\ncapacity was allowed for a climax.\nRight from the opening scene,\neverybody is panicking, rarely can\none sense the solemnity of the\npuritans. Many chilling lines are\nlost in the overall tumult.\nout of the very prison he was put\ninto for attacking the violinist,\ntomorrow. Louis ends up meeting\nthe Pianist, who, surprise, slap my\nthigh, is the perfect Christ.\nYippeee! The plot holds together.\nUnfortunately the Pianist starts\nbelieving his own divinity, does\nsome dod gy miracles whilst trying\nto kill Syb and Louis, Louis\nmeanwhile is trying to find Syb and\noh it's a mixed up world and no\nmistake. Since it's a romance Syb\nand Louis end up s noggin g. But as it was a comedy, where\nwere all the jokes? Lots at the\nbeginning and funny ones too,\nhumping goats etc, lots that were\nsubtle too and good throwaway\nlines (what sort of fish is that? A very big one.).\nBeing technical, the camera work\nis first class with shots of Paris that\nyou don't normally see as a tourist.\nThere again, as the film just wasn't funny enough, no matter of good\ncharacter work, excellent shots and\nbizarre scenario us could make up\nfor that fact.\nIf I'd paid \u00a36 to see it, the Big\n' Bronze Bap would not be happy,\nalthough I'd still try to nick a poster\nfrom the undergound.\nVital statistics: Baps zero, breasts\nnil. blood no pints, no car chases,\nno fights or chop sock y; one star.\nTrie Big Bronze Bap says don't pay \u00a36 to see it.\nThe Big Bronze Bap.\nThe Young Vic Theatre. 66 The\nCut (near Waterloo tube station).\nUntil 22.2.92. Box Office on\n071-928 6363\nBoris Springborn\nThe Roaring\nGirl's Hamlet\nImagine an all women performance\nof Hamlet! That's what The\nRoaring Girl's Hamlet is, produced\nby Sphink (ex Women's Theatre\nGroup). There is a little frame story\nto explain the unusual cast. It makes\nthem rough girls from the London\nunderworld of 1605, who, staging\na play, break the law in an\nem an zip a tory act. But this does not\nhurt the show at all.\nOriginal stage props and\ncostumes, highly theatrical lighting\nand brilliant acting on most parts\nmake this slimmed down three hour\nversion of Hamlet quite an\nexperience. As for the acting I should mention they have an\nincredibly funny Polonius, and\nHamlet\u2014well I guess you just have\nto see her. So what is the effect of\nan all feminine cast? Well, after the\naction had started, it didn't really\nstrike me anymore. What remained\nwas a weird sensation that\nsomething ain't right, which goes\nquite well with the play. Go see it.\nThe only drawback: It's in\nCroydon.\nThe Roaring Girl's Hamlet by\nSpinx at the Warehouse Theatre\nCompany, right next to East\nCroydon BR, until 23 Feb.

    "content": "14 February 1992 Felix 926 Feature\nThe PhotoSoc\nexhibition\nopened on\nMonday in the\nSherfield\nanteroom.\nRichard Eyers\ninvestigates.\nOn Monday the annual Photo Soc\nexhibition opened. Fifteen\nphotographers from both Photo Soc\nand. by invitation, Felix displayed\na wide variety of work. Overall the\nstandard is very high, though there\nare a couple of obvious exceptions.\nThe 58 photographs fill the\nSherfield Anteroom comfortably\nwithout overcrowding it. Whoever\nactually hung the prints did well to\nmake the most of the lighting\navailable. I overheard some\ncriticism that they were hung too\nclose together, but it was useful to\nbe able to compare multiple pictures\nby the same artist, (if you ever\ndoubted that photography is an art,\nyou should visit this exhibition).\nTechnically it was difficult to find\nfault with most of the prints, which\nhad been in the most part printed by\nthe photographer. This could\nexplain the dominant presence of\nblack and white over colour prints,\nbut some prints were detracted from\nby the less than competent\nmounting. A small moan perhaps,\nbut considering the time that must\nhave been spent in the darkroom\nanother few minutes could have\nbeen well rewarded. Consequently,\nmost of my comments are restricted\nto personal opinions and perhaps a few prejudices. Those attending the\nopening on Monday evening had the\nadvantage of the presence of the\nphotographers who were generally\nhappy to discuss their work,\nexplaining it where necessary,\nthough I did find the persistent\npresence of one particular\nphotographer a little annoying.\nI have not listed my thoughts on\nevery shot - you can go and make\nup your own minds - but here is a taste of what can be seen. The first\nphotograph is perfectly chosen, a striking window shot by a relative\nnewcomer to the darkroom, Sarah\nToo. It does not hold your attention\nfor too long, yet is difficult to\nignore. This is contrasted by Simon\nBolton's 'Tottenham Court Road',\nin which every face tells a story,\nand to which there is great depth.\nThe exhibition is dominated by\nA characteristic technique is not\nobvious in some of the work, but\nAndreas Brakoolias has a very\ndefinite style. I personally liked his\noriginal work, particularly 'Dusk,\nGreece', but some found it\ndisturbing, or perhaps disturbed!\nSimilarly, the work of Matthew\nJohnson was consistent in style,\nalthough I dislike the printing of\nsome of his work as they could be\nmore punchy. They have a superb\nreportage quality.\nOf the small collection of colour\nPhotographic Exhibition\nthe work of one photographer,\nAlvis Fong. His work is some of the\nbest I have seen in any exhibition,\nbut unfortunately he has also\nentered the worst picture in the\nexhibition. 'Feeding' should never\nhave been included in an otherwise\nstrong collection. A number of\nstudies in black and white can only\nbe described as excellent - 'Repair',\naccompanying this review, and\n'Houseboat' in particular, drew me\nback again and again. Fong's equipment is somewhat elitist, F3s\nand F4s, not to mention the use of\na Hasselblad, but his work has\nshown that these are only tools, that\nit is the photographer that makes the\nphotograph. His versatility is\ndemonstrated with 'Greenery',\nwhich is something quite out of the\nordinary.\nprints, 'Statue and Half Dome' by\nStef Smith stands out, both due to\nits quality and considerable size.\nAlso, Steven Kenny's sunrise was\nsatisfying ly simple, though his\n'evening' could have been better\ncropped.\nFinally, I have to mention Kate\nParker's 'Harley-Davidson' and\n'Iron Horse' by Edward DuninWasowicz, purely because I liked\nthem. I would recommend this\nexhibition to anyone, whether or not\nyou are interested in photography,\nit caters for a wide range of tastes,\nand might provoke a few thoughts.\nIt closes on 28th February.\nAnyone wishing to get involved\nin the Photographic Society should\ncontact James Evans, Mech Eng II,\nor visit Southside at 1.00pm on\nTuesday.\n\u2014 5 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 926 14 February 1992\nHan Mien Kho\nand Abdul\nMalek Said on\nthe Malaysian\nVariety Show\n'Flight MH 002'\n'Selamat data ng', directly\ntranslated from the indigenous\nMalay means 'welcome upon your\nsafe arrival', shows an extension of\nMalaysian hospitality and\ncordiality. For Malaysia itself is an\nexquisite jewel of tropical paradise\nand arguably the most beautiful\npiece of land on earth. From coral\nreefs and sun-bleached sands, to\nwhite-water rapids and rubber\nplantations; from surreal limestone\noutcrops to pressure-cooker coastal\nresorts..., you name it, we got it.\nSponsored by Malaysia Airlines,\nMalaysian Society is for the second\ntime presenting the annual\nMalaysian Variety Show, hence its\nname 'Flight MH002'. To\nwelcome you, we will serve you the\nmost exotic Malaysian cuisine. You\nwill be thrilled by 'Ayam Masak\nMerah' (a traditional mild chicken\ncurry) with 'Nasi Minyak' (Rice\nblended with herbs and oil). Also\nyou will find 'Acar' (preserved\nvegetables) ir resist able. Alongside\na wide range of other dishes,\nincluding the vegetarian, we are\npresenting authentic delicacies from\nhome, so don't mistreat yourself.\nAfter the exhilarating meal, a glance at the most sophisticated TV screens at Subang International\nAirport, Kuala Lumpur, you are\nkindly requested to be on board\nFlight MH002( Great Hall...!).\nCarried by probably the fastest\nsupersonic jet, your flight to\nLondon Heathrow Airport (i.e. the\nshow) is estimated to take two\nhours. Treated as an honoured\nguest, you are now on board one of\nthe most luxurious flights (let alone\nthe imagination). Instead of\nshowing you movies, we have\nspecially employed a cast of 30\nMalaysians to give you a live\nperformance. You will be presented\nwith a series of most graceful and\nspectacular traditional dances, a rich and exuberant fashion show,\nhaunting tunes and sensational\nsketches. So just sit back and relax,\nand let us fill your senses to the\nbrim.\nTogether with special lighting\neffects, our gifted musicians will\nbring vitality to the night by a rather\nlavish opening ceremony (details\nare yet to be uncovered). Our 'state-of-the-art' performances will\ncomprise three cultural dances,\nnamely 'Kuda Kepang', 'Ulek\nMayang' and 'Wau Bulan'. Kuda\nKepang is a traditional dance that\ncommemorates Javanese men who\nspread the Islamic faith in the\ninterior land of Java. They rode on\nhorseback and told dramatic tales of\nbattles to attract the interest of\npeople. The dance is performed by\ndancers astride 'two dimensional'\nhorses made of hide. They act out\nsome battle scenes. This very\ndramatic dance form is\naccompanied by the throbbing drum\nbeats of gongs, tambourines and\nang kling s( a percussion instrument\nmade from bamboo). The 'Ulek\nMayang' dance drama is probably\nthe most favourite dance amongst\nthe IC Malaysian students. This\ndance visualise s the romance\nbetween a young fisherman and a mystic procession. It begins with\nseven fishermen going out to sea,\nand one of them was killed in a storm and his body subsequently\nwashed ashore. Seven mystic\nprincesses then appeared and\nbrought him back to life by their\nmagical powers. The next dance is\nthe 'Wau Bulan' (Moon kite).\n'Wau' or kite flying is serious\nbusiness in the East Coast of\nMalaysia. Some of these ceremonial\nkites may be over ten feet in height!\nThey are made from bamboo and\npaper and though heavily decorated,\nare still aerodynamically feasible\nand aesthetic. The Wau Bulan dance\nis usually performed by the youth\nas a pastime after the harvest. In\nfact, the Wau Bulan also conceives\nthe supreme honour of being\nselected as the logo of the national\nair carrier, Malaysia Airlines.\nMalaysia's rich cultural heritage\nis evident in the colourful variety of\ncustoms and festivals of different\nethnic groups who have their home\nhere. Lastly descendants of\nimmigrants from China, the Indian\nSubcontinent and Sri Lanka,\ntogether with the aboriginal Malay,\nthe people have gradually acquired\na distinct identity as Malaysians\nwhile retaining their traditional\ncultures, customs and festivals. For\na change of taste, we will be\ndemonstrating the ancient art of\nChinese calligraphy. But before\nthat, we like to tell you a remarkable story behind it. In 1695,\na medical shop-keeper called Wang\nYi-young of the Shan Tung\nProvince in China discovered that\nthere were some cryptic inscriptions\nengraved on the pieces of bones that\nhe was selling. He probably never\nknew that those inscriptions are in\nfact what we now know as the\nearliest forms of Chinese writing.\nThey are part of the archives of the\nShang royal house, the first\nhistorical dynasty (1500-1027BC), and comprise questions put to the\noracle through the medium ship of\npriests-scribes-diviners, together\nwith the oracular verdicts. Three\nand a half thousand years has\nelapsed since then, Chinese\ncalligraphy too, has transformed\ntremendously. This is chiefly due to\nthe advances in technology and\nincreasingly flourished schools of\nthought of the scholars. Here we\nwill perform Xing Shu\u2014the most\nA Malaysian Paradise\n\u2014 14\u2014\n\n"

Feeding power to its strings\nit forced the player to make a seventh and then, his face racked\nwith fear, Mercy started playing\nsolo, his fingers dancing up the\nfretboard under the control of the\nanimal. Faster and faster his fingers\ndanced until, falling to his knees in\npain, he screamed aloud as the\nguitar forced his fingers to play a high C. The crowd groaned aloud as the\ncackling guitar was returned to its\nstand and the broken player was\ndragged aside, blood streaming\nfrom his lacerated fingers.\n'NOW STRESS MUST PLAY!'

The\nscheme is one of several plans\nwhich are set to form a students'\ncharter, aspects of which may be\nincluded in the Conservative Party\ngeneral election manifesto.\nThe initiative plans to link pay\nawards for lecturers to student\n(customer) views of their\nperformance in lecture halls and\nseminar rooms, and is reported to\nhave the support of the Secretary of\nState for Education, Kenneth\nClarke. Mr Clarke was one of a group of ministers and advisors who\nattended a seminar in Downing\nStreet midway through January.\nSenior sources close to the Prime\nMinister have disclosed that Mr\nClarke was directly asked by an\nofficial from another department if\nhe was in favour of a link between\nstudent assessment and lecturers\npay. The Education Secretary\nresponded that it was a good idea\nthat the Department of Education\nand Science (DES) could work on.\nThis has caused confusion within\nMr Clarke's own department.\nRoger Frost, DES Press Officer,\ntold Imperial College News\nNetwork (i CNN) that 'there are no\ndepartmental plans'for a students'\ncharter,' but he added that if it were\nto be a manifesto proposal, the DES\ncould not work on the idea until it\nbecame Government policy. Tessa\nKesswick. senior policy advisor to\nthe Secretary of State, told us that\nthe idea of students assessing\nlecturers' pay was 'not a Conservative idea. It may be\nsomething the Labour Party would .\ndo, but it is not one of our ideas.'\nMedia sources have already\nreported that tensions exist between\nthe policy 'think-tank' at 10\nDowning Street, and the policy unit\nat the DES. The Guardian\nWestminster Correspondent, David\nTwenty five thousand students from all over Great Britain attended a mass rally called by the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) on Wednesday 12 February. The march was called to protest about student\ndebt and the student loans system and was supported by Imperial College Union.\nMr David Taylor, acting NUS press officer, described the meeting as 'large, peaceful.. and very\nsuccessful. ' Mr Taylor also stated that the message about student debt had 'got across' as the coverage\nof the march had been very good.\nHenke, reported yesterday morning\nthat the Prime Minister has\ninstructed Sarah Hogg, the head of\nthe Downing Street policy unit, to\nrewrite the manifesto by pledging\na raft of initiatives in the public\nsector. Mrs Hogg has already\nreceived a dossier of ideas\nfollowing on from the January\nseminar. These include the\nstudents' charter, and charters on\nhealth and transport.\nThe pay initiative has been widely\ncondemned. The National Union of\nStudents and the Association of\nUniversity Teachers have already\nindicated that they will not support\nthe proposals. Stephen Twigg, NUS\nPresident, has said that the charter's ideas 'show no understanding of\nstudents' problems, nor any genuine\ncommitment to solve them'. Labour\nHigher Education spokesman,\nAndrew Smith, told i CNN that 'the\nonly pieces of paper students want\nto see from this government is ten\npound notes.' (i CNN) "

    "content": "Feature Felix 926 14 February 1992\nAPPY \u00ab y Fox NCURABLE\nALENTINE\nHIV\u2014if you asked people in the\nstreet what those three letters mean\nto them, most of them would tell\nyou it was a disease related to-AIDS, some may even know the\nsymptoms or how it can be\ntransmitted but few would know all\nthe facts or realise just how many\npeople are affected by it.\nHIV stands for Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus. If the\nvirus gets into the bloodstream of\na person, it begins to attack the\nwhite blood cells (T4 cells). These\ncells form part of the immune\nsystem and help to prevent the body\nfrom getting diseases. HIV enters\nthe T4 cells and makes them\nproduce more of the virus which\neventually kills the T4 cells.\nEventually there are not enough T4\ncells to protect the body from\ninfection.\nThe majority of people with HIV\ninfection show no signs of illness\nand will look and feel well and\nhealthy. Some people . may\nexperience symptoms shortly after\ninfection. These many include night\nsweats, swollen glands, weight loss\nor a persistent cough. These\nsymptoms are very similar to those\nassociated with the common cold or\nflu. The virus may lie dormant for\nup to ten years before any signs\nbecome apparent.\nOther people may go on to\ndevelop further symptoms of their\nHIV infection including persistent\nswelling of the lymph glands in the\nneck, armpits and groin, continuous\ntiredness, unexplained weight loss,\ncontinuous dry cough not related to\nsmoking, diarrhoea, thrush,\nunexplained bleeding, shortness of\nbreath, cold sores, night sweats and\nfevers.\nThe development of any of these\nsymptoms does not mean that you\nwill go on to develop AIDS\u2014\nhowever they are a sign that the\nimmune system is not working\nproperly.\nHowever, a number of people\ninfected with HIV will go on to\ndevelop AIDS. AIDS stands for\nAcquired Immune Deficiency\nSyndrome. 'Acquired' refers to any\ncondition which is not present at\nbirth. 'Immune deficiency' means\nthat the body's immune system,\nwhich fights off illnesses, is not\nworking efficiently. AIDS is not a single disease: it is a 'Syndrome'\u2014\nor-group-of specific infections and\ncancers, which occur because the\nbody's immune system has been\ncompromised.\nThe condition that we now\nrecognise as AIDS was first\nreported in the USA in 1981.\nBetween June and November of mat\nyear, 159 reports of people with\nAIDS were received. Three\nquarters of them come from three\nmajor US cities and 95% were gay\nmen. The first reports of AIDS in\nthe UK were in London in\nDecember 1981.\nThere were, undoubtedly, people\nwith AIDS before 1981, but careful\nretrospective studies have shown\nthat it was rare and affected few\npeople compared to the numbers\nnow involved. AIDS must have\nbeen exceedingly rare before the\nmid-1970s anywhere in the world.\nAIDS now occurs in most\ncountries. The number of people\nwith AIDS varies enormously\nbetween countries, but most of them\ncome from large towns rather than\nrural areas.\nWorldwide, most people with\nAIDS are heterosexual men and\nwomen. However, in the developed\ncountries, AIDS has first affected\ngay men, haemophilia cs and\ninjecting drug users.\nBy December 1990, the World\nHealth Organisation (WHO) had\nreceived reports of over 305,000\npeople with AIDS from 179\ncountries, but they estimate that the\ntrue number of cases is likely to be\nmore than 800,000 with between'\n8-10 million infected with HIV.\nThe majority of people with HIV\ninfection do not have AIDS, so HIV\ninfection is more common than\nAIDS. The WHO estimates that\n65% of all global HIV infections\nhave resulted from heterosexual\nintercourse.\nThe number of people in the UK who have been tested and are\ntherefore known to be infected with\nHIV is 16,248. The total number\ncarrying the virus has been\nestimated to be as many as 100,000\nof which 5,191 had been officially\nreported as having AIDS by\nSeptember 1991.\nIn the UK the proportion of\npeople infected with HIV differs\nbetween regions and between\ndifferent groups of people.\n44% of people with haemophilia\n(who are usually male) were\ninfected by 1985, before the\ncontamination of donated blood was\ncontrolled. This is known to involve\napproximately 1,200 people.\nPeople who have injected drugs\nhave rates of infection from under\n2% in some regions to 70%, with\nthe highest proportion found in\nEdinburgh.\nGay men attending sexually\ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics\nhave rates of infection from less\nthan 2% to 25%, depending on the\nclinic, i Other heterosexual people with\nHIV infection have been infected\nabroad. Heterosexual spread of\nHIV also occurs among injecting\ndrug users and their sexual partners.\nIn the UK, the great majority of\npeople known to be infected with\nHIV are gay and bisexual men and\nha emo phil acs. However, this trend\nis changing. Injecting drug users\nand heterosexual men and women\nrepresent an increasing percentage\nof those with HIV infection. During\n1990-1991 the numbers of HIV\ncarriers rose by 17 % in homosexual\nmen, 36% in heterosexual men and\n93 % in women. 70% of people with\nHIV in the UK are in London and\nthere are about 150 new cases of\nHIV every month\u2014which is about\n5 per day.\nHIV is not easily passed from\nperson to person. The virus is not\n'caught' in the same way as diseases\nlike chicken-pox or 'flu'. It is\ntransmitted through:\n1. Sexual contact, especially anal\nand vaginal intercourse. However,\nnot all sexual activities are risky.\n2. Shared use of needles and\nsyringes may transmit HIV. This\nincludes sharing 'works' to inject a drug, repeated use of medical\ninjection equipment for more than\none patient, and re-use of\nacupuncture, tattooing\", or body\npiercing needles without proper\nsterilisation. Very rarely, accidental\ninjury with contaminated needles\nhas transmitted HIV to a health\nworker.\n3. In the past, from blood\ntransfusion and products made from\nblood used to treat haemophilia.\n4. From mother to baby, before\n(and perhaps during) birth. After\nbirth, HIV may rarely be\ntransmitted by breast feeding.\nCertain sexual activities or drug-using activities that are able to\ntransmit HIV from one person to\nanother are called 'high risk\nactivities'. Even then, it must be\nremembered that for exposure to\noccur, one person must already be\ninfected by HIV.\nHIV is not transmitted by insect\nbites, nor through coughing or\nsneezing, swimming pools or toilets\nseats as insufficient amounts of\nvirus are present.\nWhat do you think?\nWhenever something unknown\nhappens, people react in different\nways\u2014horror, compassion, guilt\nand plain in comprehension. When\nAIDS was first identified in 1981,\nand HIV isolated two years later,\nmost of us experienced these\nreactions. There was talk of 'guilty'\nand 'innocent' people, or a 'plague'\nand of a disease 'punishing' people.\nBut how can people be guilty of\nhaving an illness, and how can a virus be said to punish certain\nsectors of society? People with\nAIDS, or who are HIV-positive, are\nno more victims of a vicious virus\nthan people who catch a cold. One\nthing that AIDS has meant is that\neveryone has to be honest, to admit\nto the past and to realise that the\nmorality of sexual relationships has\nchanged. The one-night stand now\nmeans more than simply fun\u2014it\ncould mean one person passing on\na virus that can develop into a series\nof cruel diseases.\nWe have to work out a code of\nconduct that encourages honesty,\nand admit U \u00bb our weaknesses. AIDS\nmeans that everyone has to think\nabout what their actions mean for\nthemselves in terms of feelings and\nhealth and for the well-being of\nothers.\nFurther information\nIf you would like more information\nor advice you can phone the\nNational AIDS helpline at any time.\nThe number is 0800 567123 and all\ncalls are free and entirely\nconfidential.\n\u201416\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "14 February 1992 Felix 926 Opinion\nDear English Friends,\nThe tragic situation in South\nOssetia makes us write to you and\nask for your support.\nSince the autumn of 1989 the\nnationalistic forces of the Republic\nof Georgia have been carrying out\nan armed terror and violence\ncampaign against the Osset\npopulation both in Ossetia and in\ninner parts of Georgia. South\nOssetia has been undergoing a military, political, economic and\ninformational blockade. Since 1991\nmore than 300 people have been\nkilled, hundreds of people\nwounded, more than 160 are\nmissing and more than 480 have\nbeen brutally tortured or mutilated\nbeyond recognition. Many of them\nhad their ears, noses, tongues and\nother parts cut off, their eyes put\nout. their faces and bodies burned\nby blow-lamps. As a result of\nwinter blockade dozens of people -mainly the elder y and children -died of hunger and cold. The\npopulation of 90 villages within and\noutside South Ossetia have been\nforced to leave their homes, over 65\nvillages have been plundered,\nburned down and destroyed by\ntanks. The number of refugees from\nSouth Ossetia and Georgia today is\nabove 100.000. A great number of\npeople, among them Thorez\nKulumbegov. a leader of South\nOsset Government, are languishing\nin Georgian prisons. What is\nhappening here is a gross violation\nof national minorities' rights and of\nhuman rights as well. It's a mass-scale extermination of the Ossets.\nIt's a genocide.\nThe situation is extremely tragic.\nThe capital of our region -Tskhinvali - and villages nearby are\nheavily bombarded. Houses are\ndestroyed and every day we have to\nburs our friends and relatives,\namong which there are children,\nwomen and elderly people.\nThe armed aggression and\nviolence in South Ossetia is\ncombined with propaganda\ncampaign which has the aim to\njustify before the world public the\naggression against the minor nation.\nThe Ossets are labelled as\nnewcomers' on the land where our\nancestors have lived for thousands\nof years. According to the antique\nhistorians (Strabo. X!.111,3) the\nOsset ancestors - Sarmats-Alanslived on this land since a.d. If this\nperiod is short for deserving the\nright of being called a native people\nthen what can one say about the\nwhite Americans who appeared in\nAmerica after Columbus? Or\nequally about the Russians in\nSiberia who moved there after\nErmak's campaigns, or about the\nHungarians who came to Europe in\nthe Middle Ages?\nIn 1920 Georgia became a part of\nthe USSR. The Bolsheviks, who\nconsidered the absorption of smaller\nnations by greater ones as a factor\nof progress, divided the Osset lands\nbetween Russia (North Ossetia) and\nGeorgia (South Ossetia). The\nbolshevik government made a rich\ngift to Georgia by including South\nOssetia in the Georgian Republic.\nBeing a part of Georgia had tragic\nresults for South Ossets. Our people\nhave undergone oppression and\nforced assimilation. In 1920 the\nGeorgian government implemented\nthe policy of a genocide, as a result\nof which more than 5,000 people\nleaders of the USSR and the socalled stars of democracy, including\nthe great pacifier Shevardnadse.\nwho were called upon to protect\npeople against violence and to\nensure security, have demonstrated\nfull inability and unwillingness to\ndefend the people of South Ossetia\nfrom the danger of being\nexterminated. It is their tacit consent\nthat inspires the Georgian\n'democrats' to new barbarous acts\nand hideous crimes.\nThe results of the coming events\nare not hard to foretell. Very soon\nnothing will be left df South Ossetia\nexcept the burnt out land and dozens\nSouth Ossetia\nVitali Tibilov, two years old, shot from a helicopter whilst in kindergarten.\nwere killed and many thousands\ndied when escaping to North\nOssetia over the Caucasian\nmountains.\nToday the Georgians are trying\nto represent the war against South\nOssetia as an ethnic conflict\nwhereas in reality it is an\nextermination of peaceful people\ncarried out by the well-armed\nGeorgian troops. The crimes\ncondemned at Niirnberg can't be\n-compared with those committed by\nthe lawfully elected Georgian\n.government.\nAll the crimes of the Georgian\naggressors have been only partly\ncovered by the Soviet mass media.\nThe English correspondents were\namong the first to break through the\ninformation blockade of South\nOssetia. the first to tell the world\npublic the truth about the crimes of\nthe 5-.5 million Georgian nationals\nagainst 65 thousand Ossets. We are\nvery grateful to them.\nThe central government doesn't stop the violence, it hasn't even\nintroduced the emergency rule on\nthe South Osset territory. The\nof thousands of corpses which no\none will be left even to bury. This\nwill happen if Georgian aggression\nis not stopped.\nSouth Ossetia is not Kuwait.\nThere are no oil fields in this land.\nThe great powers have no interests\nwhich they might defend. South\nOssetia is a test of genuine\ndemocracy for those who consider\nthemselves advocates of human\nrights because they can't expect\neconomic benefit in return for\nsupporting the Ossets rights for\nfreedom and life.\nWe appeal to you for support.\nDon't let the injustice triumph,\ndon't let the innocent people be\nexterminated. Raise your voice\nagainst the violence in South\nOssetia. Each death in this dirty war\nagainst our people is not only a dark\nstain on the conscience of our\nmurderers. The responsibility lies\nalso on those who encourage these\nNazis to new crimes by keeping\nsilent. Students of the English\nFaculty together with all the\nStudents of South Osset Teachers'\nCollege.\nAs the former\nSoviet Union\ncollapses,\nviolence and\nhatred begin\ntheir rule\nNo article in Felix necessarily\nreflects the opinions of the\nnewspaper, its editor, Imperial\nCollege Union or the staff of either.\n\u201421 \u2014\n\n"

UCL were back to\ndefend'their cup with only eight\nmen (does that make them confident\nor just plain dumb?), while the other\ncolleges were relative newcomers\nto the game. That made IC hot\nfavourites to not only win, but to\nsweep the top placings.\nAnd so battle commenced. PLOP\nstarted in great style, del u xing their\nopposition in their first three\nmatches in a combined total time of\nabout 17 minutes, for a total loss of\nfive men. STACK held their own\nin such company, with a100% record (3 matches, 3 wins) going\ninto lunch.\nIt was all building up to a grand\nfinale. PLOP won their penultimate\nmatch without loss in a mere 3\nminutes. That meant PLOP vs\nSTACK as the final match to decide\n1st and 2nd places, but only if\nSTACK could beat UCL. Twelve\nmen against six (two guns had since\npacked up). It didn't look too hard.\nLike shooting fish in a barrel.\nBut the fish shot back! UCL stunningly reversed the expected\noutcome, despite being reduced to\ntwo men (against eight). The flag\nwas hung, and it wasn't UCL's. In\nthe words of the UCL captain, 'they\nplayed like shite'. And so UCL guaranteed themselves second\nAbortion Talk\nThis Thursday (20th February) at\n12.45pm in the Union SCR,\nProLife Soc is hosting this years\nSPUC Youth & Student Division\nLecture Tour, at which all are\nwelcome. The topic is\n'Developments on RU486' and the\nspeaker is Catherine Francoise.\nSome of our committee have\npreviously seen Catherine speak at\nBlackpool, so we can safely say that\nthe talk will be both lively and\ninformative.\nRU486 is an abort if aci ent drug\ndesigned to replace surgical\nabortion and has recently been\nlicensed for trials in the UK. However there are grave doubts\nover its safety, let alone its\nadvantages over surgery. Its\nsuitability for the Third World is\nalso dubious, although this is the\nhuge market almost certainly\ntargeted by its manufacturers. If\nyou'd like to hear more about\nRU486 and how you can help\nprevent another disaster on the scale\nof Opren or Thalidomide, come\nalong to the talk on Thursday.\nM Castles (Chair ProLife Soc,\nElec Eng II)\n\u201418\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "14 February 1992 Felix 926 Editorial\neditor i a Tim Proctor's letter.\nCorrect. I am the Print Unit\nManager. But my job is not one of\ngenerating publicity for ICU clubs\n- I manage the Print Unit. In the\npurest sense of the word this would\nmean maxim ising profit for the\nUnit, which would exclude all\ninternal print work, for which we\ncharge only the cost of the materials\nand an amount toward the\nreplacement of equipment. You do\nnot pay for labour and we operate\nori a self help basis where possible.\nBut I work for a student Union, so,\nin fact, I have to deal with hundreds\nof students' enquiries, ranging from\nthe completely clueless and inept to\nthe imaginative and enthusiastic.\nBearing in mind the voluntary\nnature of most of the staff in the\nFelix Office and Print Unit as well\nas the wide variety of clients, it is\ncompletely unreasonable to expect\na100% efficient streamlined\nservice. Printing stuff for other\nbodies started as a favour, as neither\nthe printing press nor the typesetter\nbelong to the Union, but they were\ngiven to Felix expressly for Felix\nproduction in part payment for\nmoving from what is now the\nBiology Common Room. Printing\nICU business other than Felix is\nsecondary to Felix, and has to be\nfitted in when there is time. I am\nunder no obligation at all to provide\na print service to anybody, but I do\nto help the smoother running of the\nUnion. As for the photocopier, if\nyou have a spare \u00a3100 to call out\na mechanic who will only draw in\nbreath, say 'God, who installed\nthis? It's got to go,' and disappear\nlike your money will, I would feel\nvindicated. Likewise I would be\ngrateful for information as to how\nto fix the damn thing. I do not relish\npaying nearly a \u00a31000 a quarter for\na pile of junk that only rattles and\nsmells disgusting when turned on -the service contract was drawn up\ntwo years ago, since which time the\nservicing company has gone\nbankrupt taking with it our money\nand a lot of other people's.I do not know the printing dates\nof Guildsheet months in advance.\nIndeed last term there were so many\nlast minute changes of publication\ndate that I lost count. It is fitted in\nwhen it can be, and when it can't HAIRDRESSERS\n15A HARRINGTON ROAD,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\n071-823 8968\nWe have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women\nCheck us out !\nit is referred on. As a point of\ninformation, the Felix printer is not\npaid for his overtime by the Union.\nInstead, he is given time and a half\nin lieu - ie, for every hour of\novertime he can take one and a half\nhours holiday anytime. Last year he\nbuilt up several weeks worth of\novertime which he would never\nhave time to take off, as evidenced\nby the amount of overtime he had\nto do to keep up with the work.\nEventually an amicable\narrangement was reached, but this\nyear the same thing has started to\noccur. To avoid the situation as per\nlast year, he has decided to work off\nthe time owed in lieu week by\nweek, and the both of us have\ndecided to cut back on other work.\nThis results in three days of printing\nper week, of which Felix takes at\nleast two, and occasionally three. I can't change the laws of space and\ntime, though a proximate action is\nbeing undertaken to rearrange the\nPrint Unit, in co-operation with the\nUnion Office. As an alternative to\ndumping all overflow print work,\nit is redirected to Stabur Graphics,\na company in which I have no\nfinancial interest in whatsoever,\nwho use the Print Unit's equipment\nwhen the Print Unit's printer isn't, and who pay the Unit a rent for the\nprivilege.\nRockSoc letter\nFirstly, I did not respond to the\nRockSoc letter of last week because\nPoddy had already had a go and I thought it unfair to respond as well.\nSecondly, more important things\ntook over the editorial. Poddy is\nentitled to his own views, for which\nhe must take responsibility and\nwhich I will neither endorse nor\ndenigrate.\nThe original letter said I had been\nrude when faced with Mr Ham.\nThis is quite true. I believe Mr Ham\nentered the office with the offending\nFelix, flicked the offending article\nwith his finger and said T want an\nexplanation of this.' That sort of\nopening gambit is bound to raise my\nhackles, and by God it did. Sorry.\nThis letter was not couched in such\na way that demanded response as it\nwas merely an undisciplined rant -with an unpleasant personal taint to\nit. As for 'violating' my duty as\neditor, 1 understand that that meant\nthat I should not have allowed\nPoddy's bit to go in. Why not? It\ngoes in for the same reason that I allowed both RockSoc letters in. I can't go around telling people what\nto write. My duty as editor is more\nof a legal and moral one, to protect\nFelix, it's staff and myself from\nlegal action caused by inaccurate\nand defamatory articles, not to ban\narticles I disagree with. You didn't like what went in? Tough. This is\na ludicrous subject and I resent\nusing up editorial space with it. If\nyou think the quality of Felix is low,\ncome and help raise it.\nRumbling On\nDear Adam.\nI am appalled at the disregard for\nother students shown by the\nmembers of the 'Grease' crew who\nstole 3.500 copies of Felix on 31st January. This was a particularly\nnarrow-minded and selfish act\nwhich. I believe, should be\npunished further.\nNo apology, however 'sincere',\ncan replace the hard work of the\n'Felix' team or of those who\norganised the Cluedo event on the\n2nd of February. The money to be\npaid to Rag by the thieves partly\ncompensates for the harm done, but\nit is surely the principle of the\nmatter that counts.\nAnyone who believes that they\nhave the right to censure Felix must\nalso believe that they know what is\nbest for us 'lowly' students. Well,\n1 for one resent anyone trying to tell\nme what to do or think.\nI did try to find the time to see\nGrease on its last night, but was\nunable to due to a backlog of work.\nThis is despite reading the review\non Friday 31st( yes, I did find a copy of Felix that was not stolen!).\nI actually thought the review was\nnot that bad. I am now glad that I didn't see the performance and will\ncertainly avoid future DramSoc\nproductions.\nSo, what are the chances of\njustice being done? I'm afraid that\nthey are very small due to the\ninvolvement of Ms Hellinger in the\naffair. Yet again she has shown her\ncomplete contempt for IC students\nmaking me wonder why she chose\nto stand for the job in the first place.\nIf she had any guts at all she would\nhave done the decent thing and\nresigned by now. But no, she\nobviously feels that she is not\naccountable to the student\npopulation, something that really\nmakes my blood boil... Power\ncorrupts I suppose.\nWell Adam, I feel sorry for you.\nIt appears that little can be done to\nrectify the situation. Our only hope\nis that more students feel just as\noutraged and force the Union to do\nsomething. Maybe this is a bit\noptimistic!\nYours irately.\nIan Jones, Biology PG.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

It's1941 and\nBarton Fink (John Turturro) is\noffered a screen-writing contract,\n\\ ' adrift he sets aside his qualms about\npandering to a mass audience and\nmoves to LA, where as a concession to his social conscience,\nhe checks into a rather seedy hotel.\nThere, during a brutal heatwave, he\nMy Girl\nstruggles to carry out his first\nassignment for the studio, despite\na terminal case of writer's block and\nthe intrusions of his neighbour, (not\nyour run of the mill Ramsey Street\nkind mind you) an affable, talkative\nsalesman named Charlie Meadows\n(John Goodman) who seems to\nembody the virtues of the common\nman.\nThe Coen brothers wrote Barton\nFink while stricken with writer's block during the writing of Miller's Crossing (a gangster drama set in\nthe twenties), so they must know\nwhat they're talking about, they\ncertainly know how to bring the\nbest out of Turturro, who gives an\nou standing performance, as does\nGoodman.\nOh, special met ni on must go to\nthe Film's soundtrack, which I think\nis unsurpassed in creating\natmosphere, apparently there are\nonly 20 bars of music in the whole\nfilm, with only rhythmic section\ncoming when Fink finally begins to\nwrite and you can hear the\npercussion instruments grooving to\nthe typewriter strokes.\nA great movie, which has too\nmany surprises to keep you sane,\nand will leave you exhausted and\nutterly confused.\nPoo.\nA Night at\nTunesia\nJust recently the cinema has\nsuccumbed to a phenomena that\nseemed to have lain dormant since\nthe late forties.. The phenomena in\nquestion is that of the 'child star'.\nThis last year has seen movies such\nas Problem Child, Curly Sue and of\ncourse Home Alone, sky-rocket\ntheir young stars to unimaginable\nfame and glory, as well as ensuring\ntheir bank balances will remain in\na healthy state for quite some time,\n(well, at least until they are in their\nmid-teens).\nMacauly Culkin, pint size star of\nthe aforementioned Home Alone,\nnow features in Howard Zeiff s new\nmovie My Girl. In this particular\nmovie however, Mr Culkin is not\nthe star, but provides support for\nanother young actress who I'm sure\nwill, (quite deservedly) go on to\ngreater things.\nEleven year-old newcomer, Anna\nChlumsky stars as Vada, a young\ngirl who lives with her widowed\nfather (Dan Aykroyd), and\neccentric grandmother in the funeral\nhome her father owns.\nA hypochondriac, Vada is always\nclaiming to be suffering from one\nof the ailments that plagued her\nfather's late clients, and it is not\nuntil the entrance of Jamie Lee\nCurtis (as the make-up artist who\ndoesn't know that she's going to be\nworking with the deceased), that\nthings really begin to change.\nThe movie chronicles one\nparticular summer in nineteen-seventy-two, when Vada learns\nabout friendship, love, death,\ngrowing up and the possibility that\nJamie Lee Curtis is going to be her\nnew mother.\nThe friendship between Vada and\nher best friend Thomas J( Culkin),\nis mirrored by the growing\nrelationship between Aykroyd and\nCurtis, and so the scene is set for\na few nice comic moments, a touch\nof genuine drama and a fairly\ngenerous helping of 'sweetness'.\nMy Girl does suffer from some\nrather over-sentimental scenes, but\nit is nicely played with Chlumsky\ndemonstrating considerable talent,\nand Mr Culkin (definitely not in his\n'brat' persona), showing that\ndespite his youth, he does have\nconsiderable skill as an actor. It's difficult to know what sort of\naudience My Girl is aimed at, as the\nmovie may be a touch too dramatic\nfor younger members of the\naudience. Having said this\nhowever, My Girl does make a fairly entertaining night out for\ncouples and family alike.\nRav.\nA Night at Tunesia is the title of a song by Dizzy Gillespie and of a new play by Paul Sirett at the\nTheatre Royal Stratford East. On\ntwo parallel time levels, 60s and\n90s, it tells the story of a jazz\nmusician that doesn't quite make it.\nThere is not much more to say\nabout the play, but the production\nhas some nice features: A very\nslanted, askew stage, and nine live\njazz numbers. In all, go see it if you\nwant to see a light, showy play.\nIncluding the travelcard, it is still\ncheaper than your local Cannon.\nTheatre Royal Stratford East,\nGerry Raffles Square, near\nStratford Station.

Recorded during the\ncivil war in Yugoslavia this\ncollection of ditties was originally\ndestined to be used in a dance\nproduction called Emotional. But,\ndue to circumstances beyond their\ncontrol (even British Rail can't do\nas good as mortar bombs) we have\nthe pleasure of listening to it. And\na pleasure it is. Being distributed by\n'Play it Again Sam' records it\nshould fall neatly into the Eurobeat\nstyle of dance music. This it fails\nto do completely. Its rather hard to\ndescribe, being at time orchestral,\nat others hard edged, but always\nmoving. No. there are no bombs\nfalling in the background; yes, they\ndo use the odd four letter word; but,\nwho gives a fuck.

All sadly-reduced, babes\nof pathos, existing in the memory\nof the halcyon daze of 'Blake's Seven'.\n'Hey, look Avon, it's a spaceship\nwith everything we could ever\nneed, ever'.

And then later in the game,\nan own goal from Here Today,\nTomorrow, Next Week. Just\nrecently, Hit hit the net, but was\ndisallowed from this for being a45. The atmosphere is electric here, for\nif the Sugarcubes lose a goal now,\nthey will surely be out of the album\nchampionships. What do you think,\nLise?'\nThank you Brian.
