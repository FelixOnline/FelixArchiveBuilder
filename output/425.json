    "content": "FIIIX\nMusic\nCatherine Howe: Silent Mother\nNature (RCA)\nWhen I first listened to this album I must admit that it made very little\nimpression on me and I tended to dismiss as yet another piece of vinyl. However, I am rapidly revising my opinion after\nlistening to it a couple of more times.\nAll the songs on the album are written\nand sung by Ms Howe and all credit to her\nfor putting down such marvellous lyrics. She also sings them beautifully and indeed\nthe album is very we j l produced.\nShe has a style that is somewhat\nakin to that of Carly Simon although she\nis possibly not as powerful *a singer as Ms Simon.\nOf the actual tracks on the album,\n\"Freedom Enough\", \"It Took My Breath\nAway\" and the title track \"Silent\nNature\" are outstanding on side one. The first has a very catchy ry th m and\nMs Howe sings with delight and gay\na bond on; her concert piano playing\ntogether with Paul Keo gh's electric\nguitar combine to give a good effect in\nmatching with her vocals. Her vocal talent are, however, not\nreally revealed until the title track in which she covers the full range of chords.\nThe second side of the album continues\nin the same pleasant vein as side one\nwith \"All The Music In Me\" the best\ntrack. Again, a lot of ry th mis expressed\nin this tune and there is a crisp, clear\nflute solo by Peter Z or n. The ry th m changes and picks up half way through\nthe track \u2014 another flute solo backed by\na fast percussion that trails off at the end\nof the track.\nWhether Ms Howe will get the\nrecognition she deserves remains to be\nseen with Capital Radio's Mike Allen plugging her, she would appear to be in with a chance. Anyway, I liked the album\nand if you are looking for some easy\nlistening then this album is recommended.\nKool and The Gang - Love\nand Understanding\n(Polydor)\nKool and The Gang are a band that\nhave consistently failed to impress me\nwith their style of music. It's not that I don't like the particular musical genre to\nwhich their music belongs. It's just the\naw fu ij ness they make of the whole thing.\nOn the other hand this criticism might\nseem unfair since the apparently received\nno musical training whatsoever. All I can say is, tough bananas.\nAnyway, onto the album itself. It\nkicks off with the title track \"Love and\nUnderstanding\" which despite its good\npieces manages to be too long and\nslightly overbearing \u2014. it's nearly ten\nminutes long. But, typically of the band,\nthe next track, \"Sugar\", is a beautiful\ncombination of the band ls musical talent. The backing vocals by Tomorrow'sEdition and Something Sweet really set\noff this track beautifully. It also contains\na rather nice alto sax solo by Dennis\nThomas.\nThis track is followed by \"Do It Right\nNow\", a brassy sounding tune which is followed by a equally cheap sounding\ntrack called \"Cosmic Energy\". \" Cosmic. Energy\" is the sort of music that Capital RadTo's Greig Edwards delights in playing with a gusto that I always find\na bit nauseating.\nThe only track on side two - worth\nmentioning is \"Summer Madness\" which, as with the track preceding and that\nfollowing it, was recorded live at the\nRainbow Theatre. It is a beautifully\nmelodic tune tinged with a light delicate\npercussion. It features a good piece of\narp playing by Ronald Bell. All in all, though, a rather disappointing album\nfrom the Gang. I look forward with\nanticipation to a time when they really\nget and produce an album worth listening\nto in it sent iri ty. The Steve Gibbons Band - Any\nRoad Up (Polydor).\nLed by Steve Gibbons, a man the\npublicity bump h describe as a\" poet, story teller and third generation rock'n' roller\", the Steve Gibbons Band are a five-piece band who have been around\nfor about three years now. They play\nwhat I can only describe as a gres sive rock but not in such a way as to be\nostentation s or gross.\nThe clear, precise vocals of Gibbons\nis su poor ted by the twin lead guitars of\nex\u2014Move man Trevor .JBIuxton and the\ndrums of Bob Lamb. This is the band's first album and\nquite frankly for a debut album, it is\nastonishingly good. The album moves\nfrom all rock time \"Take Me Home\"\nthorough a ballad type rock \"Johnny\nCqpl\" to the more conventional, slightly\ncommercial tune \"Spark of Love\".\nThey are a band with originality and\nstyle of their own. The best comparison\none could make would be to say that\nmusically, they were somewhere between\nthe Who and Bad Company. They are not\nas loud and heavy as Bad Company but\ntend, in my opinion, have to the Who\nalthough in the same musical style. It is interesting to note that the album is released on Roger Dal trey's Goldhawke\nLabel. Yet despite the influence that the\nWho might exert on them, the individuality\nof the band still holds firm and shines\nthrough in the personality of Steve\nGibbons.\nI shall go on about how good the\ntracks on side two are because that would\ntake pages and pages \u2014 if you want to\nenjoy some bloody good music don't just\nsit there are read this, go out and buy the\nalbum now and discover for yourself the\nnew phenomenon in rock known as the\nSteve Gibbons Band. pM J LEK PEN YONG CARPENTERS:' There'sa Kind of Hush*\n(A&M Records AM LK64581) There's a rumour going around record\ncompany circles that the profits on the\nCarpenters' records pay for A&M's entire UK operations. True or false, the\nCarpenters still sell a lot of records and\nno doubt their new album will prove to\nbe no exception.\nYes girls and boys you can get your\nhankies out, the Carpenters are in town\nagain with a soppy sentimental and\nromantic album that mummy definitely,\nwould approve of.\nThe Carpenters, whose mode of\nunpretentious Middle of the Road music\nappeals to all and sundry, have produced\nanother fine effort that exudes beautiful\nharmonies, excellent orchestration and\narrangement (by Richard Carpenter\") and\nall-round technical perfection. ' Hush' is certain not to disappoint many, yet\ncompared to some of their previous\nefforts, notably ' Now and Then', the\nalbum lacks some of that charisma that\nI 've come to expect from Richard and\nKaren.\nIn short ' Hush' is likely to appeal to\nan avid Carpenters fan who already has\nmany of the duo's part offerings, whereas\nthe newcomer would be best advised to\npurchase one of the Carpenters' previous\nofferings.\nOne point that does bug me with\n' Hush' is why the Carpenters don't song more of their own compositions.\nOut of the ten songs on the album only\nthree, 7 Need to be in Love, Sandy, and\n/ Have You are penned by Richard\nCarpenter and lyricist John Be tt is. Yet the Carpenters excel much more on\ntheir own material than they do on other\npeoples. And they don't make bad\nversions of the latter! For starters you have a splendid reworking of Neil Sedaka's Breaking Up is Hard to do in a happy 5 0 ' s rendition set against a marvellous string arrangement. Jackie De Shannon's Boat to Sail and Randy\nEdel man's Y. ou aren't far behind either!\nIn all then a rather moody, sometimes\npensive, album that won't disappoint,\nbut is more for Carpenters fans than\nnewcomers to their world.\nCLIVE DEWEY Cinema\n\" SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE BATHS\", directed by David Buckley; starring\nRobert Aberdeen, Ellen Sheppard and\nDon Scotti.\nWHATEVER THE original intentions were\nwith regard to the making of this film,\nthe end result is a badly made soft core\nporno. You know, the sort of porn, \u2022 like\nLast Tango in Paris or Emmanuelle where\nthe deep significance of what is trying\nto be said is submerged by technical\nmeandering s and hazy and unnecessary\ndiversionary side plots of very little\nvalue.\nMichael (Robert Aberdeen) is an out\nof work pianist who eventually finds a job in club run for homosexuals and\nlesbians. Scotti (Don Scotti) is the\ncom per e at the club and needless to say, is a homosexual and Tracy( Ellen Sheppard) is Michael's photographer\ngirlfriend..\nOn his opening night, Michael refuses\nto allow Tracy to attend the show. When\nthe show is finally over he goes out for\na stroll with Scotti and hey presto, they\nare in bed making i ove \u2014 the way in\nwhich the whole thing is presented\nsuffers from the flippant attitude of \"I told you so( re homosexual tendencies),\ndidn'tI\". He then goes to meet his girl friend\nat her studio' and in not so many words\nshe finds out that he made it with Scott i. Just at the point when one would\nexpect the story to really begin to\ndevelop it stops. It's finished. The\ndirector has finally exhausted himself\nafter 90 minutes.\nIf Mr Buckley was trying to tell us\nhow hypocritical about sex people are, even the self proclaimed liberals, then\nit was not his fault that the message\nseeped through. Anyway, do we not know\nthis already? Surely the full import of a guy making love to his girl friend and\nthen to a homosexual is that he can love\nboth the male and female of his species. This tedious film has only one\nmoment of sparkle in it. That is when\nthe \" straights\" meet the \" gays\" in a football match (American football, of\ncourse!) I shall leave the game to\nyour imagination.\nPAUL EK PEN YONG "

Changing the current Union\nPolicy could lead to a better democracy. The Student Union\nNo matter how effective the President\nof a Union, is, it Is almost Inevitable\nthat there will often only be a small number of students interested in Internal/\nexternal politics. At Imperial College, with about 40% post-graduates and about\n40% Overseas students, the relevance of\nthe Union unfortunately tends to be even\nless than at other Universities. Union\nmeetings appear to draw a regular, small\npercentage of politically motivated\nmembers. For many more students, the\nUnion only helps fund their activities. Perhaps the majority make little use of\nthe facilities, and so provide a large\npool of resources for the interested few.\nOne Interesting phenomenon in this\ninstitution is that its members are conservative (small ' c'). Thus, when an\n'extremist' motion Is put to a Union\nMeeting it is likely to be heavily defeated.\nUnion Meetings\nBearing in mind the comments in the\nfirst section, it is very difficult to see how the Union's activities can be openly\nshown to affect the quality of life! on\ncampus. If the matters di cussed could be\nThe imp efta! College Orienteering\nClub has only been in existence since\nlast October, and it was officially recognized by the Athletics Club Committee in January of this year.\nSince its inception, club members have\nbeen competing in Orienteering ' Events' on most Sundays, in forests all over\nSouth of England. In total, members\nhave competed in over 20 different\nevents and TO C' is now a well know\nname in orient erring circles. The club has also organised its own events on Wednesday afternoons\nfor members of IC and other London Colleges. These have been held on\nHampstead Heath, Richmond Park and\nWimbledon Common. The club owns 10\nwhist lds7* which are used for introducing\nnewcomers to the sport. It is a group\nmember of the British Orienteering\nFederation, and four of the club are\nindividual members of B OF. Only two members of the club, Alan Leakey and David Rosen,' had had any\nsignificant orienteering experience\nbefore the club was formed. However,\nmany of the newcomers are already\nproducing good results and Rob All in son is well on the way to achieving a gold standard. Alan Leakey has been\nrunning very consistently, rarely\nmissing a 'gold' time. David Rosen has\nbeen having his most successful season, and is currently clear leader\nof the South East' Gallop pen', having\nwon three of the four events.\nMembers have also competed for the\nUniversity of London Orienteering Club in several major championships including\nthe. Midland, Southern and Scottish.\nFour from IC were at the Jan Kjellstroim\nInternational Orienteering weekend in seen to be Immediately relevant, the\nattendance figures might dramatically\nchange.\nUnion Council\nThe 'management' of Imperial College Union Is vested in a committee of about\n40 students ( ICU Council). This may\nappear to be .democratic, but Council cannot claim to be representative of\nUnion Members (Members represent the\nbodies who elect them). In many instances\nCouncil erupts into explosions of flippancy,\nwhich are unbecoming to the management\ncommittee.\nDecisions made by a large group of\npeople (who have not always considered\nthe full Implication of their voting) may\nsuperficially be democratic, but may not\nbe in the best interests of the Union. It is dl ff u cult for people to hold their\nconcentration for longer than 2 hours, and\ncan result in incorrect decisions being\nmade, which would put Council into\ndisrepute. Yet, meetings last about 5\nhours, and have occured roughly every 3,\nweeks during this session. In addition,\nthe large time commit t ment to attending\nthe meeting may unfortunately discourage\nsome students from helping the Union, and may also not allow Council Members\nto adequately read discussion papers\nrelevant to issues being considered at\nthe Meeting.\nthe Lake district at Easter, and a week\nlater, five from the College took part\nin the BUS F Championships at Stirling.\nHere, David Rosen won the Individual\nrace, and the next day was a member\nof the winning University of London\nTeam in the relay.\nFor the next year, the club hopes to\ncontinue to grow and there is already news of a keen oriente er coming\nto the College next term. Last term, we\nwere fortunate to be able to use the\nACC minibus on three occasions and\nthere was a noticeable improvement in club spirit when we were all able to\ntravel together. It is hoped that we will be able to use the minibus even more\nregularly in future. We have been\nfortunate in gaining a lot of support\nfrom members of the cross-country\nclub and Pete Johnson is a member of\nboth committees. Next year we will also try to encourage regular participation by people who are less athletically\nminded but who just enjoy a stroll in the country. We have had very little\nresponse from the women at College and this is another group that we will be vigorously encouraging.\nColours for 1975\u2014 76 were awarded to:-Full: Alan Leakey\nHalf: Rob Allinson\nJohn Gibbins Pete Johnson\nSteve Webb\nMike Welford\nThe Committee for 1975\u2014 76 was\nCaptain : David Rosen\nSecretary : Alan Leakey\nTreasurer : John Gibbins\nTransport Officer: Mike Welford\nDavid Rosen\nSlight mis-management of a Union\nmay be considered democratic, but the\nreal danger Is that the result can be that\nthe whole Union management is ignored\nby the parties which it seeks to help and\nthat is not democracy. Reduction of the\nsize of Council and/or an even stricter\ncontrol on reports to Council( more\nWorking Parties, with reports being taken\nas read) could greatly improve a situation\nwhich has several times been chaotic\nduring the last three years!\nCommitteee Management\nI sometimes ponder on a question:\n\"Why do Intelligent people resort to the\nuse of Standing Orders to conduct\nmeetings?\" Is this really good democracy,\nwhen some members are distracted\nthrough boredom?\nShould a chairman always remain\nsilent? Is there supposed to be some\nelement of discretion so that the business\ncan be expedited. Of course, the Chairman\nruns the risk of being challenged,\nprovided that the Committee is alert,\nwhich it should be!\nExecutive or sub-Committee decisions should be accepted, not discussed again. However, the power to over-rule\na decision must always be vested in the\nsuperior body.\nGordon Jackson Parker's Piece\nTHE NEW postgraduate grants for\n1976/77 were announced to the Commons\nby Mr Mull ey, Secretary of State for\nEducation, on Monday. These bring the\nvalue of a London studentship to \u00a31,380\n(previously \u00a31,180). For students outside\nLondon the new figure is \u00a31,270 (\u00a31,085)\nand for t? bse living at home \u00a3^25 (\u00a3790).\nIn the light, of recent wage restraints\nby the Government and the Unions, a rise of 17% might, at first sight seem\nquite reasonable. It is only when one\nlooks more deeply into these figures that\none realises how criminally low they are. Last month, new undergraduate ( UG) figures were announced which gave them\na grant for the next academic year of\n\u00a3955 for London, an 18% rise. This is1% more than the percentage PG rise.\nThis is an insult in itself, but even more\nso when one considers that the UG grant is already higher than aPG grant\nin terms of \" real\" weekly allowance.\nSome reshuffling of UG allowances has been made so that it will not be worthwhile\nto claim Social Security during the\nChristmas and Easter vacations.\nEven with this taken into account, the\nreal value of an .UG grant for the 31\nweek statutory term time will be \u00a327.90\nper week. APG will receive \u00a326.53\nover the whole year. When one adds to\nthis the availability of demonstrating\nwhich is restricted, and the fact that\nUG s have an opportunity to earn large\namounts during the summer vacation,\nthe new figures appear even more absurd.\nFor London students there are extra\ndifficulties as the va Sue of the London\nweighting in percentage terms has act y ally been reduced.\nOne can only conclude from these\nfigures that the Goverment puts less\nContinued on page 6\nWell known after\nonly a year\n\n"

So sang Tim Curry in a clip from the \"Rocky Horror\nShow\" which opened the first 'Film Talk'\nof the session. This was the first\nprogramme in the series to be recorded in the near broadcast quality studios of the\nILE A'S Educational Televison Centre.\nNext came Dirk Bogarde. He was in thee\ncountry to promote his latest film\n'Permission to Kill' and as well as appearing on STOIC, he was interviewed\nby Capital and Russel Harty.\nHaving recorded the interview, clips from his many films had to be acquired.\nTherein lay a problem. If you want a clip from a film which is no longer on release\nyou have to pay \u00a3270 for each minute\nof film used to the Kinematograph\nRenter's Society, a body which looks after\nthe interests of the distributors. Further\ninvestigation revealed that if your\nprogramme is industry approved you\ndon't have to pay anything. Film Talk is now an industry approved programme.\nNext, Terry-Thomas, who had come from\nIbiza to p remote 'Spanish Fly'. Several\ncritics vehemently expressed their doubts\nas to the quality of this film. This Theatre\nWhen the new National Theatre\nbuilding was being planned it was decided that besides the two conventional\nauditoria there should be s small studio\nthe ate with flexible seating arrangements,\nto be known as the Cottesloe. Because the Cottesloe is not yet ready, the\nNational Theatre Company has taken\nover the Young Vic, in the cut by\nWaterloo Station, for a season lasting\nthrough the summer. The first production,\nShakespeare's Troilus and Cressida\nopened last week and runs until July\n22nd in repertory.\nTroilus and Cressida was written at\nabout the same time as Hamlet and this\nproduction contains many of the familiar\nfaces from the National's\" Albert Finney\" Hamlet, thus helping those of\nus who delight in spotting the parts that\nShakespeare wrote for the same actor;\nfor example Feste, Touchstone and the\nPorter in Macbeth, or here, Polonius Agamemnon, Osric and A j ex. The audience is greeted, on am val, by\nan imposing circus ring surrounded by a four foot high wall and surfaced with\nneatly raked damp sawdust. At one\nmoment I was almost sorry that the\ndesigner had forgotten the lion tamer's cage, although the small space ensured\nthat the battles never got out of hand.\nInstead of Liberty Horses and performing\nseals we have a lot of verbal clawing, some wailing and a bit of sulking before\nthe long play reaches it climax in the\nfight between Hector and A chillies, aided by his hy mid on s, unpleasant\nlooking men with masks and a variety of\nnasty weapons, who dispatch Hector in a number of ways.\nThe play is the only one that Shakespeare wrote about the Greeks (unless\nyou include A Midsummer Night's Dream)\nand takes place during the siege of\nTroy. Whilst the tittle might suggest a momenta! love match in the style of\ninterview took place in December and\nthe studio was freezing. Terry-Thomas\nstrengthened his coffee with the contents\nof his brandy flask.\nAnother star of Spanish Fly, Leslie Phillips was interviewed at the College shortly after. He was making a film\ncalled 'Not now comrade' outside the\nAlbert Hall. In the last lunch break of the Spring\nTerm Barry Humphries made a second\nvisit to the TV Studio. This time,\ninstead of the ubiquitous Austral i an\nHousewife Dame Edna Everage, we\nwelcomed the man himself. At the time\nDame Edna was, and still: is starring in\n\" Housewife Superstar\" in the West End. This programme which was transmitted\nlive was the last to be made in Room\n306, Ele c Eng, the home of the TV studio\nsince its inception nearly 7 years ago. The studio is now being rebuilt in Room\n208.\nApart from ' Film Talk' this year's other main productions have been weekly\neditions of 'LUNCHBREAK' our weekly\nmagazine programme. Michael Williams' presence as anchor man lent the\nprogramme authority within the College Troilus Cressida at the Young Vic\nRomeo and Juliet the plot concerns\nmore, at least in this production, the\nchallenge of Hector to the Greeks, taken up by Ajax whilst Achilles is sulking in his tent with his boyfriend\nPatroclus. There is a wealth of minor\ncharacters, not least amongst whom\nare Troilus, as on of Priam, King of\nTroy, who loves Cressida, at a distance, and Cressida, who thinks it might be fun\nto encourage him. After their night of\nbuss it is announced that, in an exchange\nwith the Greeks, Cressida will be\nhanded over to be with her father,\nCalc has. who has defected. She immediately\nturns her attentions to Dionedes the\nGreek commander who carries out the\nexchange; unfortunately Toil us sees\nthese advances and the two suitors\nmeet in battle; what happened next I found it hard to discern! Robert Ed dison plays, the engaging\nPandarus matchmaker between Troilus and Cressida, his niece. In a delightful\nscene he points out to her the heroes as\nthey pass by in procession. The r sites could be said to be the Touchstone of the\nplay; Philip Stone draws a fine portrait\nof this jolly tap ster, cutting his teeth on\nsome fine wit with Achilles and Ajax. You would be well advised to read\nup your Aeneid before you go; a playgoer\nnear me had to have the plot explained\nin loud whispers. Fortunately the\ncostumes do distinguish Trojan from\nGreek but it is helpful to know who's who beforehand as a Plethora of familiar\nnames pass before you. The programme\ndoes give a short legendary biography of\nthe characters. What marred the evening\nmost was the late arrival of about fifty\npeople \u2014 the Young Vic is no lr well designed for the accommodation of\nlatecomers \u2014 please arrive early.\nThe National Student Drama Festival brings five award winning productions to\nthe Roundhouse from 27July to 7 August.\nwhich it had lacked during previous\nyears. Editions of note include our\ncoverage of rag week and a memorable\nstreak round the Albert Hall. The Union Hustings and Elections were covered\nlive with considerable success.\" Despite technical limitations, our coverage\ndoubled the number of people witnessing both events.\" LUNCH BREAK IS RECORDED is every Wednesday evening. One technical\nproblem which confronted us last year\nwas the lack of editing facilities. For example, when cutting from one item to\nthe next, the picture would roll furiously\nfor about ten seconds. The College has\nrecently acquired editing facilities and\nthese will improve the technical quality\nof our productions, particular i ly LUNCH! BREAK, considerably.

Let me keep you in\nsuspense no longer \u2014 everything you\nhave read about the album (that has already been banned from WH Smiths and\nBoots) is true \u2014 well almost.

Sadly. this is not so, which is not to\nsay this is a bad album. In fact its an\nalbum which I found quite enjoyable,\nalthough lacking any sort of originality,\n(the band having strong leanings toward\nsy tle of Bad Company, which is inevitable\nI suppose) it contains plenty of high\noctane energy and feeling, two superlatives that become mandatory when\ndescribing any work Paul Kos s off was\ninvolved in. The band itself is tight 'n 'hot with\nTerry Wilson on bass and Tony PI tuna gel on drums laying down a firm rhythm on\nwhich John 'Rabbit' Bundrick builds his fine keyboard work.

'Blue Soul',\nthe next cut, is a melodic blues with\ntasteful piano and acoustic guitar,\ntaking the song along until the band\nbursts ' back, with the vocalist bawling\nout the lyrics with a lot of energy.\nUnfortunately the album nose dives\nwith the next two songs \u2014 'Stop What\nYour Doing' and 'Raging River', which\nare straight rockers with little to say\nfor them, but the last track on the first\nside. \"Some Kind of Happy\" is a real\nin a relatively restrained manner,\ncompared with so nie of the vocal frenzy\nthat appears on other parts of this\nrecord. The next offering is one of three\nMatthew Moore songs included. 7 broke\ndown' which proves to be the albums sole\ntrack which shuffles along with any sort\nof urgency, the rest being the moody\nhii dil v emotional, often unbearably\npoignant interpretations that have become\nthe Cocker hallmark.\nInevitably, Bob Dylan is represented\non Stingray, he providing two of the\ncompositions. One of which, the previously\nunrecorded 'Catfish' proving to be the\nalbums finest piece, with Joe in fine\nvoice, and making the most of the\nshivering, ice cold arrangement given to\nraw meat in his face.\nThe Albertos reckon \"most musicians\nsuck\" it says on the press handout, and the band leave the listener in no doubt\nas to whom they think suck the most,\nthose bastions of moronic musa k Hawkwind and Pink Floyd. During 'Mandrax\nVariations \u2014 Parts', the band make\ndirect reference to the music of \"wind and\nFloyd, with parts of Silver Machine and\nEchoes, given new arrangements, and\nFollow the Guru' is a disarming step\nback into Barretian Floyd psychedelia. I could go on, but I guess you've got a picture of what this album's all about.\nMy only disappointment with the\nrecord is the sad omission of the all time piss-take that always proves a killer in their stage act \u2014 the immortal\nCaptain Beefcake routine, complete with\nfarting saxophone. The Albertos are\nreally a band to see, but this album is the next best thing, you' ll probably get\ninto it \u2014 but your mother wouldn't like it.\nIAN MORSE crease r, and once again, Wilson-Slesser\nis on top form, backed up by a girl\nchorus who make this the cut of the\nwhole album.\nThe second side opens with 'Sweet\nBeauty' \u2014 another ballad which is given\nadded momentum by the guitar playing\nof Kos s. The remaining tracks - 'Just for You'.\n'On Your Life' and 'Leaves in the wind'\nare good, but fall into the same cat a gory as so many Free and Bad Company songs.\nNevertheless, despite its faults this\nrecord is an essential addition to any\ncollection that contains work by either\n(or both) of the aforementioned bands, as\nit is the last statement by someone who\nhad more than a passing influence on\nboth Free and Bad Company, and for that\nmatter British rock as a whole.\nthe song by the band. This is the fourth\ntrack in, and from now on Cocker sings\nwith the rasping, raging intensity that\nonly this man can give to seemingly\nromantic songs. As the second side\nprogresses, the intensity level gets\nhigher, * until with 'Worrier' and 'Born\nthru Indifference', Cocker sounds as totally wasted as he looks on the\ngroup's cover photo. No wonder Joe is a forerunner in the rock casualty stakes.\nIf you like Joe Cocker a lot then\nyou' ll probably get into this album, but\nif yours is just a passing interest,try\nsome of the less intense recordings, like\n'Jamaica'.\nIAN MORSE The Last Record Album\nRock casualty hangs on\n\n"

I am sure no PG expects\nnor needs a financial incentive to do the\nwork he or she does, but the financial\ndeterrent of the present level of financing\nrequires a lot of enthusiasm and dedication\nto beat it.

Down to the canal, minding the right angle bend\nonto a three foot wide bridge\nwith no handrails over a backwater, along the tow\npath, past some really foul\nsmelling factory fumes which\nwould have brought tears to\nMooney's eyes had he been\nrunning this time, up over six lock gates to a main road with\nall that beautiful carbon\nmonoxide which makes running\nso enjoyable, back down to the\ncanal, past 'Southside' again\nand up to the finish; a good\nfive miles! Rob All in son as always was first home in4 th place in a very good time\nof 24.41. Steve Webb running\n\" a blinder\" was8 th, not quite\nbreaking the 5 minute mile\nbarrier with 25.08. Paul Clarke just recovering from\ninjury was38 thin27.30. Pete Johnson just broke the\nsix minute mile barrier with\n29.18 for 58th place closely followed by Alan Leakey30.38 in 65th place. The team was a very creditable 4th, just\nmissing medals by 10 point's. It was felt that some London Pride was needed to settle\nour stomachs \u2014 so the Dove\nwas visited afterwards. If you\nhave a thirst and need some\nexercise there is the Horsham\n10 followed by the King and\nBarnes 10 in the evening on\nJuly 19th; see our Union\nnotice board for details.

The weekend before he was 4th in the Olympic Trials for the\nsame event.\nControl 9 takes\nits toll\nON SUNDAY a small party of\nthree travelled to Thorndon Park, near Brentwood to take part in\na relay organised by Havering\nOrienteering Club( usually\nreferred to as HAVOC). Traditionally, relay teams\ncompete under silly pseudonyms,\nand IC have taken this one\nstage further by entering the\nindividual members of the teams\nin a similar manner. Thus the\nEmpirical Overshooters team\nagain featured such stars as\nR Braunschultz and LK Seltzer.\nUnfortunately no-one could\nthink up a name which, in this\nclean family sport, was suitable\nfor Alan Leakey; he thus ran\nunder his own name, which\nwas considered to be silly enough anyway.\nThe navigation was not\nunduly complicated, a good\nnetwork of paths, allowing one\nto follow ones progress on the\nmap by running along a path\nand counting the number of\nother paths which one crosses. This caused problems for Rob All in son, who is incapable of\ncounting higher than three\nwhile running. As a result he\nspent some time looking for\ncontrol seven about 150\nmetres too far to the north before\nrealising his mistake. Some\nareas of the woods were\ncovered in knee-deep ferns and\nbracken, which owing to the\nmorning rain were absolutely\nsaturated: Control nine, in a small depression in one of\nthese areas, was particularly\ndifficult to find, and Alan Leakey lost nearly 10 minutes\nfinding this control. The other\nteam members were more\nfortunate here, Rob All in son falling into the depression\nwhile - wandering aimlessly through the bracken, and Ian\nIsherwood, on seeing another\noriente er apparently rising\nvertically out of the ground,\ncorrectly deduced that this\nperson must have been visiting the control.\nThe IC team eventually\nfinished *5th out of about 20\nteams in the Class' A' relay.\nRob All in son brought them in\n6th on the first leg with a time of about 39 mins for his5 km course; 5 minutes down on\nthe leaders. Steadily improving\nIan Isherwood pulled the\nteam up to 5th, with a time of\naround 50 mins. Alan Leakey started off well, and had\nmoved up to 3rd at one point,\nbut unfortunately lost both\nthese places at control 9.\nHe eventually finished with a time of 44 mins, only a few\nyards behind the 4th placed\nteam.\nHullo de reb rudders an' \\ As you all knows, dis is\nsisters'.

Instead, they call for\na fee differential between\nfull-time postgraduates and\nundergraduates.\nOn the basis of this\nproposal, tuition fees for\nfull-time university students\nwould be levied at \u00a3250 for\nundergraduates and \u00a3450 for\npostgraduates in 1977/78.\nThe reports also calls on\nuniversities to contain, by\nvoluntary agreement, the\npresent open-ended commitment\non OS. The limitation of OS\nwould be made between a university and the UGC according to the university's need.\nThis would in effect stop\nuniversities from making up\ntheir numbers with OS. Colleges such as IC which had large\nnumbers of OS would keep to\ntheir present levels of OS intake and would therefore\nnot suffer under this proposal.\nThe choice of discrimination\nis described by Sir Brian Flowers as \" reasonable and\ncertainly undeniable\". Sir Brian went to comment:\n\" Overseas students are a strain on the taxpayers and a heavy one at the moment.\nGiven the present c irc um stances, we ought to accept\nvoluntary restraint and run the\nrisk of discrimination between\nundergraduates and post-graduates\".\" If one complains too much\nthen the choice is between\nhigher fees for postgraduates\nand something much worse\", he added.\nFor those PG s who are\nalso overseas students the\nWorking Party' s fees proposal\nmeans that although they will not be much better off, they\ncertainly will not be -much\nworse off.\nRaise your hats, blow your trumpets,' cause Ents lost \u00a3 7 0 0 on last Saturday's GB and concert.' Judging from the expressions of these two people( above) at the concert, they couldn't give a damn.'\nCollege tuition fees\nFOLLOWING the 30% increase\nin tuition fees for colleges in\nhigher and further education\nannounced by the Secretary\nof State for Education last\nDecember, the College is to\nimpose session al fees of\n\u00a3211, \u00a3426 for home and\noverseas under graduates\nrespectively and \u00a3 2 0 1 , \u00a3416\nfor home and overseas post-graduates.\nThe Hardship Fund set up\nby the University Grants\nCommittee ( UGC) will operate\nfor the session1976/77. In addition, the UGC has widened the application of the\nfund to cover all students who\nwere in attendance in 1975/76\nand not only those who were\nhelped from the 1975/76\nfund.\nThe available funds will also be used to alleviate\nnext sessions 30% increase as well as this session's \u00a370\nincrease.\nHelp with the higher level\nof fees will be restricted to\nstudents who pay their own\nfees and had already begun\ntheir studies at IC in1975/76 or who had made the decision to enter the IC before March\n1975. Claims by IC students\nfor remission in 1976/77 will be considered by a special panel of academic staff set up\nby the Board of Studies.\nApplication forms are\nobtainable from Mr J Bevan, Room 344 Sherfield Building. Flowers\non power\nIN A MAJOR speech, at\nTuesday's National Energy\nConference in London, the\nRector, Sir Brian Flowers,\nexpressed considerable anxiety\nabout proposals to develop a fast breeder reactor system\nas the basis for Britain's nuclear power stations.\nSir Brian, who is Chairman\nof the Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Protection, was speaking prior to the publication of the Commission's report on\nthe environmental hazards of\nthe nuclear power industry.\nIn his opening remarks the\nRector said that the Commission accepted that nuclear power\noffered the possibility of much\nless pollution than conventional\npower stations. However they\nfeH'that nobody should rely for\nsomething as basic as energy\non a process that produces in\nquantity a by-product as\ndangerous as plutonium unless\nhe is absolutely convinced\nthat there is no reasonable\nalternative course of action.\nI am bound to say that we have\nnot been wholly convinced that\nthis is the case by the\nevidence sum bit ted to us'\nThe Rector then outlined the\nawkward disposal problems of\nPlutonium arising because of\nits long radio-active life.\n17% for PGs\nAVERAGE INCREASES of 17%\nin the postgraduate grants for\nthe next session were announced\nby Secretary of State for\nEducation, Mr Mulley, on\nMonday in the House of\nCommons. The new grant levels( with last year's in brackets)\nare \u00a31,380 (\u00a31,180) for\nthose outside London and \u00a3925\n(\u00a3790) for students living at\nhome.\n\n"

T P<7F Only?.\nAlice through the EEC. ONE DAY ALICE happened, just to be\nclimbing up a steep, steep wooded\nmountainside. She took out her pocket\ntelevision set and saw that Mr Wilson\n(ie Callaghan) was about to hold a referendum on the Eurovision Song\nContest \u2014 could we bear the ex cr uti a ting pain of it each year anTi could Cliff\nRichard still go on representing us now\nthat he is an OAP?\nAlice realised this would have a direct bearing on the Marche Commun, in\nwhich, she felt, we must remain.\nHowever, she came across Le Tigre\nPresque Mort and was very concerned,\nseeing as she had campaigned vehemently\nto stop the IC1 from giving dogs cigarettes\nto smoke! She wept'buckets and tears and\nasked the Tigre why he was nearly\ndead. He managed to stutter a few words\n\"The c..c... Contest.,.c... cruelty\", of\ncourse Alice immediately linked this\nwith the subject of the Referendum and\nrang up the RSPCA to enquire whether\nsuch singing could have such a drastic\neffect on animals. She used a trunk call,\nnaturally, because she was in a forest \u2014\nthe line was engaged.\nA few steps further on she began to\nhear music \"How sweet\", she thought,\n\"A Christmas carol\". But soon, soon the\ndreadful truth filtered through. It was the\nGerman team flexing their vocal chords\nfor the contest with ' O Tannenbaum'.\nHorror upon horrors in true song contest\nstyle each team had decided to copy\neach other, hence the French version\n'Mon Beau Sapin'. The whole wood\nresounded with the dreadful cacophony, so\nAlice sang the ' Red Flag' like a good\nSocialist and also because it happens to\nbe the same tune.\nShe then tried the straight line test\nwhich indicates whether one has lost\none's equilibrium due to horrendous\nnoises \u2014 she failed miserably. Let there\nbe a moral there.\nAs you have probably guessed, the\nmountain was an EEC Butter mountain and\nso it will not surprise you that soon she came upon an EEC Wine Lake. What will\nsurprise you is that there was a Red Indian sailing or canoeing on it! Explanations were d needed. \"Big.chief-jam-but ty say-much-bitter-for-butt is in-european-but ty ci ub\"(E EC to intellectuals). Eek by Gum! exclaimed Alice, as she learnt\nthat everyone was now in the EEC. Except Le Tigre Presque Mort, who had\njust decided to stop playing silly billies. Continued on page 11\n\n"

    "content": "FILIX 7\nPROFILES:\nPaul Ekpenyong\nI'VE BEEN teasing Paul all week that l'd leave this space\nblank, as a moment o to his many spoof pages. That, though,\nwould be too unkind a gesture to someone who's put a tremendous\namount of work into the Union's hardest sabbatical job. So\nhere goes!\nBelieve it or not Paul E sien Inang Ukorebi Ekpenyong (p hew!) was born in East London in 1953. After various 'liberal studies'\nat Tottenham Technical College, Paul came to IC in 1973,\nsupposedly to study Mathematics. He soon realised this mistake\nand resolved to make a big impact on the IC social life and the\nactivities of IC Union. Three year's later he can justifiably\nsay he has succeeded (even Sir Brian' s secretary knows him\nas Pingpong).\nTo call Paul an alcoholic and a gourmet would certainly be\ntrue, but that in itself would gloss over many a humerous occasion. After all how would you go about celebrating the fact that you\nnever get a hangover, however much booze you consumed?\nPaul's alcoholic intake has at times given rise to many a precarious situation, particularly during his year as FELIX Editor. Nevertheless, despite walking along and across the tube\nlines at West Kensington station (after one too many glasses of\nAbbot), and despite a rather arrogant encounter with a taxi\ndriver in Soho Square, which was only resolved when Pingpong\njumped onto the taxi-cab bonnet screaming 'take me to Soho'\n(even he can't remember how much he' d had to drink that night),\nPaul has managed to survive his year as editor.\nOne notable incident happened at the end of his first term as FELIX Editor at a party given by Ricky Graham and friends.\nPingpong arrived rather drunk, to put it politely, and proceeded\nto down half a bottle of whiskey in two gulps. Minutes later he\nwas seen chatting to John Downs and Julia Ross. Apparently he\nmanaged to talk intelligently for half an hour before passing out,\nclutching a pint of lager! After being carried home he decided to\nwalk into a shower fully clothed.\nOn occasions he has been seen sober, although he still maintains frequent appearances in the Union Bar, despite the\nfact that the bar staff once decided to strip him after hours, and\ndespite frequent threats from his bank manager.\nHis eating habits are probably less well-known, although\nmany students will have guessed them after his frequent journalistic\nattacks on Mr Mooney's catering. Many restaurants, especially the Great American Success, have also experienced the byproducts of Paul's gastronomic dissatisfaction. In fact he' s always complaining about the hamburgers at GAS. He heatedly\nbangs his fist on the table vainly trying to get the bill reduced.\nHe doesn't like their milk shakes either.\nSloppy waiter service is another source of annoyance to\nPingpong, who at times has had to be forcibly restrained from\nassaulting waiters. Restaurants aren't the only places that\nPaul's got evicted from. Many of his friends remember a certain\nevent that took place at a West End Cinema. A spurious comment\nto an extremely voluptuous door girl saw Paul and his friends\n(who'd already paid for their tickets) promptly evicted from the\nbuilding.\nSo far I haven't said much about Paul as an editor, although\nTony Jones doesn't seem to have left me much room for manoeuvre.\nPingpong has a great capacity for work, surely fostered by his unique ability to go without sleep for long periods. He rarely\ndisplays any after effects, although recently he has looked a bit h agger ed(I don't think he' s learnt judo yet).\nAs an editor he' s been a great source of inspiration to his fellow staff members of the last two years and has encouraged a delegation of responsibility (from copy readers onwards). He' s a pleasant, humerous character who gets on well with people. A friend who's never afraid to make a fool of himself in the interests\nof his job (just look at the quotes file).\nIn his year as editor, Paul has done much to iron-out the\nremaining technical difficulties of offset-litho, as well as extending the role that FELIX plays at IC. It is perhaps unfortunate\nthat he will be remembered for the mistakes he has made\nrather than the stability he has given the paper.\nUnlike the predecessor, who Paul describes as a' nostalgic sentimentalist', Pingpong is a self-confessed cynic, whose\nintermittent disregard of women has often fouled up his relationships with the same. This term he' s finally got his sex life sorted out, although there was a time when he was frantically\nwriting out programmes for the CDC computer in an effort to get\nhis confused objectives straightened out. So now you know why\nthe CDC' s been 'going down' recently, it's Paul's love life stretching its facilities! After 700 words I think I 've said enough to destroy Paul's credibility, and given you a clear idea of the man himself. All that remains to be done is to gather together the remnants of this\nyear's staff and sift through the books that Paul suggests I read\nThe latter include How to get your bum^bitten (twice) by an IF\nPresident and Sensual Massage. Both are available from your\nlocal Cromwell Mews bookshop.\nPS Paul doesn't write the TP column.\nClive Dewey\n(PPS: Really Clive, I wish you'de left this space blank or at least\npresented me with an air ticket to Brazil (one way) \u2014 Paul.)\nMark\nCaldwell\n\" PLEASE PAUL, CAN I HAVE THE FRONTPAGE\" is a cry that I have\nheard many a time this year. It invariably\ncomes from no lesser a person than\nMark Caldwell, who has, for the past\ntwo years been the Chairman of STOIC. He is usually trying to get one of his now famous \"Film Talk\" programmes\nblaze ned across the front page of\nFELIX. Mark is the sort of chap that old ladies refer to as \"What a polite young\nman\", for he is polite and extremely\nmodest. A trait >ne might not expect to\nfind in' a media man.\nOften seen strutting between the\nSTOIC studios and the Union \u2014 lines of\ncommunication are very tenuous these\ndays \u2014 Mark presents the typical image\nof a public school boy.( He'll probably\nshoot me for saying that because his op in i otv of these bastions of upper class education is extremely low.) Although he came here to study\nPhysics, a subject he does not find\nparticularly fascinating, he has spent a substantial part of his time involved\nwith STOIC. First prompted by a STOIC notice in Topic which he found lying around in Keogh Hall, he went one\nproduction meeting after another and has\nnot looked back since. Neither has STOIC. His first interview proved abortive\nwhen, after sweltering under studio\nlights for half an hour, his interviewees\ndidn't show up. His second interview\nwith Don Monro was in his own words\n\" bloody awful\". Since then his interviewing technic has improved although\nhe has made inevitable slips now and\nthen. Once, interviewing Prof Lai thwaite he muffed his third question on the\nfourth or fifth re-take. Prof Lai thwaite was \"quite cutting\" about the whole\naffair.\nMark has shied away interviewing\nacademics since then and finds less of\na problem talking to film stars although\nthey too can get out of hand. Interviewing\nBarry Humphreys of Barry McKenzie fame, he had tea spilt on his notes by\nBarry, who turned up dressed in drag as\nDame Edna Eve ridge. Mark's comment\nlater was \"How do you talk to a man\nwho pretends to be a woman?\"\nHis many interview es include Mel Brooks who took off Mark's glasses as\nhe was about to introduce a film clip, Christopher Lee who threatened to walk\noff the interview if Dracula was brought\ninto the conversation and Glenda Jackson who threatened to poke his eyes out with\nthe women's lib flagpole! However, says\nMark, this latter interview was his most\nenjoyable.\nThe \" Film Talk\" series, of which\nthese interviews are a part, has achieved a great deal of success and most of them\nare made outside the College. They are\nbroadcast off the ILE A'S Channel 7\nnetwork and replaced a rather similar\nbut inferior programme they used to put\nout.\nAs with other media men, Mark is always worried about his audience.\nAudience ratings are a yardstick by\nwhich a programme is adjudged\nsuccessful. The formula that he has found that works is\" noisy or dirty film\nclips and big names\" \u2014 the precise ingredients of \"Film Talk\", he was quite c huffed to find well over 100\npeople sitting quietly in the J CR watching\nthe re-run of the Tim Curry interview.\nThe success of STOIC with \"Film\nTalk and the \"Lunchbreak\" magazine\nprogramme has brought its rewards. The Rector has taken a keen interest in\nSTOIC since being interviewed and\nthe result, after many letters from Mark,\nis that STOIC now have use of editing\nfacilities costing about \u00a36,000. In\naddition, \"Film Talk\" is now an\n\"industry approved\" programme; this\nfacilitates procurement of clips for the\nprogrammes.\nHas he enjoyed being STOIC Chairman. Yes.He has been interviewed by BBC Radio London, mentioned in the Evening News and has a glowing job reference\nfrom Barry Brown, producer of BBC's Film Night. He is currently trying to get\ninto one of the independent TV companies\n\u2014 \" anyone which' ll take me\".I' m sure\nthat despite his lack of luck at the\nmoment he will eventually breakthrough\nand FELIX wishes him the best for the\nfuture.\nPaul Ekpenyong\n\n"
