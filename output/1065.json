While Mr Black agreed that\nMontpelier is a popular hall and does\n'work well', he dismissed the\n'College myth' that it had to be used\nas hostel accommodation. \"There are\nno restrictions on the use of th te building as far as I am aware', insisting that his examination of the property deeds revealed no 'legal obligations'. to purchasing the prime site. In 1991\nwhen Montpelier was officially up\nfor sale suggestions were made that\ncollege was looking for around\n\u00a312m. With recent safety problems at\nother college sites, the 'integrity' of\ncould have influenced the decision to\nempty the property. Accidents over\nthe Summer with sash windows\ncrashing down on cleaning staff are\nbut one example of the problems\nexperienced with the hall, originally\nbuilt in 1865. Concerns over leaking\nguttering and the ancient wiring in\nthe hall have all contributed to the\nIt was originally intended that\nMontpelier should be sold to finance\nthe purchase of Clayponds,\nCollege's housing estate in West\nLondon, but the late 80's property\ncrash precluded the previous attempt\nat selling the hall. While Mr Black\ninsists that no effort has been made\nto market the property again, a steady stream of developers have\napproached the College with a view\nSeptember 1997 closure deadline.\nDespite the obvious need to provide a better standard of accommodation, the housing of seventy five\npostgraduates fresher s will clearly be\ndifficult. Despite College gaining an\nincrease in their UL Intercollegiate\nHall allocation, the deficit of conveniently located beds will not be rectified until the opening of the planned\nPrince's Gardens Halls.\nBeer-can thugs face disciplinary\ncontinued from frontpage\nthough he was sup rise d and worried\nthat so dangerous a stunt had taken\nplace.\nThe student was not a resident at\nSouthside, being \"...a friend-of-a friend\" and so will not have to face a resident's tribunal. The student will,\nhowever, be facing a disciplinary\nhearing, where it will be decided\nwhat action is to be taken. A disciplinary committee consists of the two\nsenior tutors, two members of the\nImperial College Union Council, a clerk from Registry and a dean of\none of the constituent colleges as\nchair. Severe action may be taken by\nthe College, \"being drunk is certainly not an excuse\" commented Dr\nHassard.\nDANGEROUS CYCLISTS\nBelgravia Police Station has received\na flurry of complaints from members\nof the public recently, concerning\nstudents cycling on pavements in the\ncampus area.\nPC Coleman warns students and\nmembers of staff at IC that it is an\noffence under council bye-laws to\nride on the footpaths and pavements.\nIn the interest of safety he recommends that students should use the\nroad instead - that is what it's for. If\nanyone is unhappy riding their bicycle on the road they should push it\nalong the pavement instead. Any IC\npersonnel or student caught riding on\nthe pavement will be reported and\nliable for prosecution. If the police\ndo not deal with the incident, then\nImperial College will discipline the\nperson(s) involved.\nIn addition to cyclists, roller-blader s are increasingly becoming a problem on campus. Non-slip surfaces have been laid on several steps\nas a trial to prevent people roller b lad ing on the walkways, said Bill\nOldridge, from the Estates division.\n\"We are looking at alternatives, as\nthe trial has not been as successful as\nhad been hoped. Rollerbladers are a potentially serious problem; security\nstaff have been abused, and blader s are injuring themselves. They are a danger to themselves as well as o th ers, and College has a duty to protect\npeople from them\" he added.\nRON SEALED OUT IN ALL WEATHERS\nThe Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nwas rendered temporarily unable to\nleave the college on Wednesday following a problem with his security\nclearance.\nThe Rector's chauffeur-driven car\nwas reportedly denied access at the\nCallendar Road entrance when the\ndriver's swipe card failed to raise the\nautomatic barrier. One security\nsource commented that due to a computer error the car may not have been\nregistered as leaving the campus, and\nso been prevented from re-entering.\nAnother blamed \"loose wiring\" in\nthe card-reader.\nLIBRARY FIRE ALARMS SAWN THROUGH There was some question as to the\nsafety of summer users of the\nImperial College Library when, due\nto nec cesar y building works, some\nadaptations were made to the Library\nfire alarm systems.\nProblems with rewiring meant that\nin certain areas alternative procedures had to be introduced.\nHowever, the Library staff, Fire\nOfficer and Fire Alarm Engineer\nwere fully aware of the situation at\nall times. All problems have now\nbeen dealt with and the Library is\nagain able to function without the\nworry of additional fire risks. CAMPUS CAMPING In a scene reminiscent of the last\nnight at the proms, IC undergrads\nhave resorted to sleeping rough in an\nattempt to snap up the few remaining\nspaces in halls.\nIt appears that this year a relatively large number of students have not\nbeen allocated accommodation in\nCollege residences despite rumours\nthat suggest that rooms are lying\nempty in halls.\nOn October 5th, the first weekend\nof this term, Students ignored\nrequests to wait until Sunday before\nqueuing at the Accommodation\noffice in Prince's gardens and were\nfound to be waiting on the steps in\norder to be at the head of the queue\nthe next morning. However, during\nthe middle of the night security\nguards moved the slumbering students away as \"they constituted a fire\nrisk\". Ken Weir, Chief Security\nOfficer, was unaware of the incident\nuntil informed by Felix, although\nlater several students reported it, and\nis making his own investigation.\nBIKE CODING\nThose of you who haven't had your\nbike confiscated for riding on the\npavements can take it along to the\nante-room in the Sherfield Building\nto have it marked with your post\ncode for security. Police will be\noffering this service free of charge on\nOctober 28th,29 th and 30th. More\ninformation will be available closer\nto Monday 28th. It might well be worth taking\nadvantage of this service, as parts\nhave been stolen from eight different\nbikes since the beginning of term.\nSecurity have advised that the safest\nplace for bikes is on the RSM walk-way, which is covered by four separate CCTV cameras. To date, nothing has been stolen from this area.\n\n"

    "content": "12 LETTERS & NOTICES FELIX FRIDAY 18TH OCTOBER\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nreplied to this week by Jonathan Trout\nMr C replies..,\nDear Mr Baker,\nI enjoy reading your column and I hope it does not upset you too much\nif I often agree with it.\nYou commented that you feel the\nJCR is a disgrace, I could add to this\nthe Walkway Southside Gym ..\nindeed the list is too long. We share\nan aspiration to provide decent facilities for our students. The new dB's, where Estates and ICU worked\nclosely together, is an example of\nwhat can be achieved. The obvious\nproblem is money, at a time when\nGovernment is cutting back\nUniversity funding. The good news\nis that we are developing plans to\nimprove the facilities in Sherfield.\nWatch this space!\nKind regards.\nYour sincerely\n/ Caldwell\nDear Mr Riley\nI would obviously like to comment\non your article in last week's Felix.\nFirstly, the safety of staff, students\nand the public is of paramount\nimportance, and secondly, yes I have\nspent much of the last week in meetings and on site - much of this has\nbeen related to the construction projects and reviewing these with Schal.\nYour article quite rightly raises\nconcerns, some of which relate to the\nstate of the construction industry\nitself. The industry has come through\nthe worst recession I have known and\nmany firms are indeed financially\nweak. Before contractors are\nappointed, they are subjected to\nfinancial, quality and health and safety checks to try to select firms in\nwhich we have confidence. Bank\nguarantees and performance bonds\nare used where appropriate.\nNeither Schal or ourselves are\nhappy at the number of incidents that\nhave happened on site. Following the\nceiling collapse I arranged for an\nimmediate investigation into the reasons behind it. An inspection of the\nother new ceilings was also carried\nout (which were of a different construction and all quite safe). The\nmain reason for the collapse was\nindeed the supply and use of the\nwrong wire for the ceiling ties.\nMeasures have been put in place as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Schal have based a Safety\nManager on site for the next month to\ncarry out a thorough review of both\nthe BMS and Libraries project.\n\u2022 Schal are adding to their team\nwith a Quality Manager on site.\n\u2022 I have also commissioned an\nindependent review from Waterman\nSafety Limited whose report is due in\nabout 2 weeks.\nWe are therefore doing a considerable amount to ensure that quality\ncontrol and health and safety management is as good as can be. In\ndoing so, we can reassure students\nand staff that their health and safety\nis a top priority.\nFinally I'm not 41!\nYours sincerely\n/ Caldwell\nNetwork corrections\nDear Mr Feakes,\nIn The Felix of 11th. of October\nunder the News in Brief heading\nthere was a section on networking\nconnections in the Beit Hall in which\nyou mention the Centre for\nComputing Services. Since the section showed some contusion as to the\nrole of the Centre in the networking\nof student rooms in Halls of\nResidence may I set the record\nstraight?\nThe Centre is not responsible for\nnetworking within any of the Halls of\nResidence. If rooms are to be wired\nup then this must be either funded by\nthe College or achieved by the\nWardens/College Residences. As\ncurrently defined and funded the\nCentre's role is to install a network\nconnection to the basement of each\nbuilding on campus. So far we have\nnot been funded by the College to do\nthis for Halls of Residence, but we\nhave managed to create a student network on the South Kensington campus linking them, from internal\nresources. We have also provided\nnetwork hubs for Weekes Hall (a joint pilot project with the Estates\nDivision to provide data and telephone outlets in each room) and a terminal con cent rat or for each of\nFalmouth/Keogh and Selkirk/Tizard\nhalls. The Union and Felix are on the\nnetwork because the Centre put considerable effort and some equipment\ninto extending the network to the\nBeit Quadrangle. It must be said that\nthe Beit Quadrangle is a particularly\ndifficult area in which to install network wiring, and I'm sure that any\nproblems in the Old or New Hostels\nare due to this.\nFinally the Centre is not empowered to make judgements about the\nuse students may make of campus\nnetwork facilities. That is an academic issue which is decided by the\nCollege and the departments. When\nsuch decision are made the Centre\ntakes all reasonable steps to see that\nthe rules are observed and will report\nto the department (or in serious cases\nto the College) any students transgressing those rules.\nYours sincerely,\nRJHynds\nCentre for Computing Services\nSchal? Schwa?\nDear Felix,\nYour catalogue of building disasters\nhere at IC has prompted me to ask\nthis question: If there is an accident\nhere at IC, who will be held resp on si ble, and what action will be taken?\nMore importantly, will any action be\ntaken before an accident occurs?\nD Goodwin, Comp I Reports that all students are to\nbe issued hard hats with their\nlibrary cards are as yet unc on firmed.\nGood clean fun?\nDear Alex,\nWhile there is much in the article\n\"Humans: 1, Animals: 0 A philosophy by Jonathan Trout\" that I accept\nand agree with, there are some points\nthat I take extreme exception to.\nI accept that Man is the ultimate\npredator, and Man's ability to breed.\nrear and kill some lower animals for\nfood is simply a function of his superior intelligence. I don't have any\nproblems with vivisection. Some\nmajor medical advances could not\nhave been made without it. What I disagree with is the notion that hunting animals for sport is \"a bloody\ngood laugh\" or that hare-coursing\nand badger-gassing are \"good, clean\nfun\". What sort of sick-minded individual thinks that an animal in distress is \"good, plain, old-fashioned\nhilarious\"?\nIf Mr Trout thinks that visiting\nschools with mad cows would have\nplaygrounds ringing with laughter,\nthen he has no conception of how\ndisturbed and frightened children\ncould be by such a distressing dis-play.\nIf Mr Trout considers that clubbing a blind-folded donkey, or\nthrowing a goat from a castle parapet\netc, etc, is treating animals \"with the\ncontempt they deserve\", then I suggest that he gets to know me by sight\nbecause, should he be foolish enough\nto vocalise such ideas within earshot\nof me then, with a name like Trout, I would be sorely tempted to shove a6 inch, barbed hook through the roof of\nhis mouth (let's face it, it wouldn't damage his intelligence), attach a line\nto it, and hoist him from one of the\nmany cranes currently to be found on\ncampus. Now THAT would be fucking hilarious!\nMr Trout should remember that\nwhat MOST distinguishes Man from\nall the other predators on the planet,\nis his predilection with killing his\nown kind - for fun!\nKen Pritchard, Biochem II.\nDear Sir,\nI refer to the \"philosophical\" article\nby Jonathan Trout. I am no animal\nrights activist, but I can only feel\nsympathy for the writer's warped\nstate of mind and his runaway\nhumanistic ego. Honestly, I am surprised that he did not go further to\nencourage human cannibalism, since\nit is along his line of argument.\nHe writes \"If a cow could corral,\nfeed and breed me, I would take my\nstraw hat off to him on the way to the\nabattoir. As the hammer swung down\non my thick, hairy, stupid enough to\nbe caught and branded head I would\nmarvel at the genius of my slaughter-At the invitation of ICXJ Rookstore. Prof P Aikins (author or\nChemistry te xls with Oxford University Press) will be giving a lecture entitled. The Hook. The Disc and The Future on\nMonday 21st October at 6.15 pm.

    "content": "10 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 18TH OCTOBER\nSimon Baker - Voice of Reason\nFirstly, Mr Caldwell, Robin Riley is\nnot a pseudonym of mine. Much as I would love to take credit for the\nexcellent article on Campus\nRenaissance (Campus Destruction,\nmore like), I must congratulate the\nman responsible. Apart from the odd\ncrane crashing into Chemistry, the\nBMS project does appear to be proceeding well, save for the natty red\nand yellow barrier outside the site\nentrance that has been up and down\nmore often than a whore's drawers.\nThe real concern is the Library\nproject. Quite frankly, I have to say I told you so when I heard about the\nbulldozer almost crashing through\nthe roof. We have read about large,\nheavy chunks of metal falling off\ncranes, and if this were to happen\nover the Library roof, the consequences of huge metal javelins\nplunging through to Level 2 would\nbe terrible. Leaving the building\nopen over the summer was risky if\nnot foolhardy, even though there\nweren't that many people around.\nHaving seen the cavalier attitude of\nthe contractors on that site, safety\nclearly is not a major consideration.\nAs any chemist at IC knows, one\nhas to comply with all manner of\nsafety requirements before undertaking any work. As they also realise,\nthis is not really in the name of safe-ty, but an example of what is known\nin the trade as 'covering the arse s' of\nour elders and betters. The Schal\nmanagers and indeed Ian Caldwell\nhimself might care to consider this. I accept that moron crane drivers etc.\nare not your fault, but you try telling\nthe HSE that you have no legal\nresponsibility whatsoever.\nThis nation is about to be gripped\nby the greatest threat to our way of\nlife since the 1940s. Not monetary\nunion; we'll have that bit of nonsense\ndispatched soon enough. Not instability in the Middle East; a couple of\nCruise missiles and Bob's your\nuncle. This is far, far more serious. I have read that Desmond Lynam's contract with the BBC ends in\nDecember, and Sky have made him\nan enormous offer. The consequences of this are too terrible to\ncontemplate. Des is not simply a consummate professional; he is the\ngreatest sports broadcaster on the\nplanet. To cite even a small percentage of the great man's triumphs\nwould fill a year's Felixes, but one\nonly has to mention the aborted\nGrand National to emphasise the\ngenius of the Lynam. The BBC is, by\ncommon consent, the finest broadcaster in the world and sport is\narguably its strongest department. It\nhas already lost football, some cricket and Formula 1. To lose the\nGuv'nor would be unthinkable. We\nmust unite to stop this. Write to John\nBirt, petition your MP, chain yourself to TV Centre. Des must stay!\nNice to see that the wait for the first\nULU balls-up of the season has not\nbeen a long one. A resignation and\nit's still only October. Fair enough,\nsince it was for personal reasons, but\nit was almost inevitable that the\nreplacement candidate would have\nfriends in low places. The Campaign\nfor Free Education is a particularly\ndistasteful organisation that has been\nhijacked by every extreme left outfit\nin the country, and has rightly been disowned by the rest of ULU. Mind\nyou, I hope he's elected. The expression on Ghassan Karrian's face...\nin the course of duty -Freshers really are a disgusting\nbreed. At this time of year they\nmiraculously appear, obstructing our\ncorridors and barging through our\ndoors as if they owned the place.\nThey have no redeeming features;\nthey are sallow of skin and crude of\ntongue, and stagger around without\neven a hint of politeness, leaving\nonly the scent of alcohol and nervousness to remind you of their\nunhealthy existence. You can imagine them at night crawling back to\ntheir purposefully scruffy rooms at\nthe end of a pathetic night out, fumbling drunkenly under their bedclothes to alleviate the knowledge\nthat the woman they were drunkenly\neyeing up still won't be interested\ntomorrow. Freshers however can be\nexcused. They will learn in the end.\nBut there is another breed of undesirable at Imperial who is far more\ninsidious; I am talking about the lec-ture r. They are proud and well paid,\nbut in the main they are completely\nuseless. OK, so there are a few\nexceptions worthy of respect, but the\ngrand majority are totally unqualified to stand up and teach anything\nto anyone, let alone teach a complex\nsubject to a large group of people.\nThey will mumble, hesitate and ram-ble, they will read their notes word\nfor word in a grim monotone, they\nmay attempt a few feeble jokes, but\nit is rare that any student leaves the\nlecture theatre any the wiser.\nTeaching is a skilled art, and only\na very few lecturers have the motiva-tion, inspiration or skill to do it prop-e rly. The rest are simply ploughing\nthrough a heavy load of unwelcome\nwork between the hours when they\ncan carry on with their research.\nAside from that, the lecture as delivered has become unnecessary any-way. They date from a time when\nbooks were rare and expensive, and\nthe only way to transfer the required\ninformation to a large collection of\nstudents was by dictation. Now, with\nphotocopiers, and word processors, this is an outdated and point ies s methodology. It would be far better j to simply provide the students with\nprinted notes and exercise sheets and\nallow them to field any questions\nduring tutorial time. This would free\nboth the lecturers and the students to\nget on with the work they want to do,\nrather than forcing everybody to\nwaste valuable hours sitting through\na painful daily charade. This is not\nto say that lectures have no role at\nall, they do - but it is one of in spira tion, rather than information.\nLecturers should utilise their time\nto encourage thought and discussion,\nto promote the excitement of the students and to pass on their passion\nabout their subject. That is what lectures should be for; but how many do\nthis? Very few.

If that is\nso, maybe the writer should be\nopposing the persecution of his own\nkind.\nYours\nSoh Kinn Yeow\nEEE2.\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Jonathan Trout's \"Humans: 1 Animals: 0 \" (Issue\n1064): and what a neat little manifesto it was too. However it all\nseemed to hinge on the argument that\nmore intelligent being, have the right\nto exercise their blood lust as they\nsee fit. Without wishing to be sensationalist, this kind of argument has\nled to genocide in the past and\nwhereas Mr.Trout may be clear on\nwhere he divides animals and homo\nsapiens, other people are not so sure.\nAs for his claims that animal suffering is \"a bloody good laugh\",\nthat's entirely subjective; but I doubt\nthat the sight of an abba to ir worker\nshovelling offal in ten hour shifts\nwould strike him as anything but sad.\nThe fact is that the farming practices\nof our ancestors bear no relation to\nthe sick practices carried out today.\n\"(Humans) build and destroy\nbecause they can conceive of doing\nso\" is a banal and pointless state-ment. The fact that humans conceive\ndiscernment and compassion is far\nmore important.\nYours faithfully,\nMr R Coupland.\nReally, I'm disappointed with you\nall. Petty personal insults and\ndeath threats are far below the\nlevel of debate I hoped for in writing this article. Aside from this, I was most bemused to find that\nhaving written it makes me a can-ni bali stic, genocidal, sick-minded\nand warped supremacist. With the\nfairly obvious exception of these\nthree letters, the response has been\noverwhelmingly positive to the\npiece, it having been seen as a refreshing change from the usual\n\"oh poor fluffy bunnies\"\napproach. Hypocrisy is rife in the\narea of animal rights, and it was\nmy aim to provoke reasoned argument by taking an admittedly\nextreme but thoroughly self-con-s is tent stance.\nIt also seems to me that I am\nbeing branded as being without\ncompassion. This is untrue - I do\nfeel compassion, it is just that I believe that we should look after\nour own race before we start with\nothers. While there are humans\ndying of starvation, or being persecuted for their beliefs I find it contemptible that our energies should\nbe devoted to the welfare of lesser\nspecies. Who has the right to tell us\notherwise?\nFinally, I'd like to state that I believe one of the major criteria\nthat separates homo sapiens from\nthe animals is the ability to have a sense of humour.\nNo animals were harmed during\nthe writing of this reply. Except a few squirrels. Cheers - JT.\nThe effective library\nDear All,\nThe Higher Education Funding\nCouncils, have set up a working\nparty which produced a report entitled: the Effective Academic Library.\nThe report recommends a vast range\nof measures libraries should take to\nassess their effectiveness and eco no my. One measure requires us to\ncount the number of users on specified sample days and the number of\nitems they consulted during their\nvisit. The first sample days are\nMonday and Thursday, 21 and 2 4\nOctober, followed by 11 and 14\nNovember.\nSpecial notices will be put up in all\nthe libraries informing users and\ntelling them what to do (eg re she lv ing books or journals they used). I would be grateful for your understanding and co-operation. On all\nother days in the libraries, will be\ntheir usual effective selves.\nMagda Czigany,\nDirector of Library Services\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those\nof the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1066\nis Monday 21st October. Please\nbring some form of identification.\nLetters may be e mailed to our\naddress: felix@ic.ac.uk\nMONTPELIER HALL\nAnother week, another issue, and\none without the recurrent problems\nof the first two thankfully. However,\nanother issue has indeed risen with the condemning of Montpelier Hall,\na decision that seems to have taken\nmany people by surprise.\nAlthough the Hall has been up for\nsale before, and the an nou cement comes some time before the Hall will\nclose, the problem of meeting the\nCollege commitment to house all\nfirst year students looks even\ntougher. To the best of my knowl-edge, there has been no proposal as\nto where to put next year's first year\npost grads. Will the extra entitlement\nin the intercollegiate halls be\nenough? Will the post grads be close\nenough to South Kenisngton for\nthem to want to live there?\nSAFETY HELMETS FOR\nALL?\nIt would seem that all this talk of\ndoom and gloom and Biblical style\nraining of bit of concrete from the\nheavens has worried some newcomers to the college (see D Goodwin's letter, left).\nThis is perhaps adding unnec ces sari ly to the burden on Freshers.\nThey already have had to stand in\nmore lines and sign more forms than\nthe mightiest beau rac racy could wish\nfor, and now perhaps they must\nqueue up again for a little chit to\nexchange for a safety helmet.\nThe campus is coming quite a dangerous place already without more\nqueues to trip over and the n ecce ssi ty for firmer head gear.\nTROUT ON THE HOOK\nI was happy to see some of the\nresponses to Jonathon Trout's article\nin last week's Felix, particularly\nsome of the reasoned answers to his\npoints. I am not sure what petty and\npersonal insults Jon took from the\nreplies, but I hope the irony can be\nappreciated by all concerned.\nThis subject is emotive to many\npeople, and spawns frustration for\nthose on both side of the debate.\nArticles such as Jon's can help to\n'break the ice' and perhaps initiate\nsomething more meaningful.\nPerhaps contrary to Jon's opinion,\nit would seem that Ken Pritchard has\nat least a dry wit.\nSUCH A NICE MAN And I mustn't forget to thank the\nchap in CCS who kindly sold us a vital cable even though the shop was\nshut.

Come the\nsecond half the IC machine started to\ncrank into gear. QMW then found\nthemselves under the co sh as IC\nstarted to swarm.\nPressure was converted into points\nas newcomer prop, Rob Gare, thundered over for the try. The conversion being supplied by returning outside half Gareth Williams. Despite\ndominating for long periods, further\npoints were proving elusive to come\nby. However, IC played to the end\nand as an epic three-minute period of\nplay resulted in Paul Hardcastle\ntouching down for the last score of\nthe match. Result 25-12.\nIn the day's second game, IC's2 nd XV went down 24-0 against\nQMW's2 nds. The third team open\ntheir campaign this weekend, with a match against St Mary's on\nSaturday. All support is welcome.\nWarm thanks being extended to\nthe IC Ladies, who hopefully pitched\nup a few pointers for their on and off\nthe field activities.\nThis early season setback should-n't deter IC from success in the near\nfuture. New faces, old hands and an\nabundance of skill and class under\nthe guidance of professional coach\nKevin Bell (Richmond) should weld\nthis IC team into a formidable unit -capable of tackling anyone.\nRESULTS\nMENS HOCKEY I C1ST XI82 ROYAL FREE1ST XII C2 ND XI20 ROYAL FREE2 ND XII C3 RD XI10 ROYAL FREE3 RD XI LADIES HOCKEY I C1ST XI01 QUEEN MARY AND WESTFIELD\nIC2 ND XI07 ROYAL HOLLOWAY MENS RUGBY I C1ST XV1225 QUEEN MARY AND WESTFIELD 1STIC2 ND XV024 QUEEN MARY WESTFIELD 2ND XV Hockey Firsts strike\nagainst Royal Free...\nThis amazing collection of brilliant\nplayers selected to play - honour ably for the IC Firsts waltzed all over\nRoyal Free Hospital. Two hat tricks\n(Kabadii and Plasticman) ensured a glittering performance in only our\nsecond game of this very promising\nseason. We were playing so well,\nthat even Johnny Fartpants scored\nfrom 2.4 inches, and that sweeper,\nChicken Boil was in the hunt for\ngoals. The final result of 8-2 was a poor reflection on the evident quality\ndifference.\nPubo boss kept a clear head as\nRent Boy remained exceptionally\ncalm when converting a slick short-corner combination. Mr T was solid\nas ever as pressure on him increased\nduring the game. This pressure\n(amounting to several kilopascal s we are scientists after all), finally got\nto our ginger goalie Tim, Red\nHelmet, conceding two easy goals\nlate in the game.\nIndiana had obviously enjoyed his\nFreshers' week too much to be effective, in fact, he was crap, as was Sid\nthe Sexist, alias give-me-the-ball-and-let-me-try-and-dummy-the-whole-opposition-and-score-myself.\nGoldenboy is still refusing to\nsquare any balls, as was Porn-o refusing to stay wide (Yann got\nFu**ing wide). \"This team has the\npotential to score on a regular basis.\"\nopined Rent Boy.\n,,,as do the Seconds...\nIC 2nds continued their winning run\nthis season with a20 victory over St\nBarfholemew Hospital.\nAs usual the game started like a house on fire, with fouls aplenty.\nEventually, Rab forced a short cor-ner, which our captain Goran flicked\ninto the top corner of the net to the\nraucous cheers of the team. An\nimprovement for goals from short\ncorners over last season when we got\nnone. Anyway, lots of attacking play\nfrom both sides followed, but IC was\nsuperior and we held out till half-time.\nThe second half started unlike the\nfirst, no fouls but butchery all over\nthe place. After some Barts' pressure\nand near misses, IC strode up the\npitch with ineffable ease and Shaggy\nsmashed a ball against the keeper's body.\nSome IC pressure followed and a confusion between the umpires and\nthe players involved a retaken IC\nfree hit. Taken it was, played about\nwith consummate ease before\nRichard Brut, who was feeling a need for young boys, smashed the\nball into the net. More Barts' pressure followed before the end of the\ngame, but we won, they lost, so roll\non IC Hockey.\n.. .and the Thirds\nAfter a tentative start, the 3rds Animals came roaring into life after\na penalty flick from pudding at 10\nminutes.\nIt was felt by many that the score-line did not reflect the depth, quality\nand general dominance of the rampant IC side, whose stalwart defence\noften threatened to overwhelm the\nmedical opposition.\nClinical passes and impenetrable\ndefensive work are fast becoming a hallmark of this promising 3rd's side, and they can only build on the\nsold foundations laid against St\nBarts.\n\n"

Mr Dearden will take over the Finance and Services portfolio\nfrom retiring sabbatical Claire Lawrie.\nMARIA IOANNOU\nThe University of London Union has\nat last found a replacement for the\npost of Vice-President. The resignation of the previous incumbent,\nClaire Lawrie, at the beginning of\nSeptember caused some dismay to\nthe three remaining sabbaticals, who\nhave had to take on extra duties\nwhilst organising the election for her\nsuccessor.\nMonday's elections, the first\nGeneral Union Council of the year,\nhave ended this period of uncertainty\nwith Nick Dearden, a Masters student from University College\nLondon, being elected to the post.\nHowever, Mr Dearden's election has\nnot been trouble-free.\nIt was thought that he might be\nbarred from standing after giving a pre-election address to Felix (Felix\n1064), a breach of electoral rules.\nAfter the Elections Committee\nsought, and found, a precedent in\n1992, where the GUC dismissed a similar allegation, it was decided to\nallow Mr Dearden to run. Mr\nDearden's close links with Ms\nLawrie were also questioned, though\nthe Elections Committee have since\nmade it clear that it would have only\nposed a problem if Ms Lawrie had\nactually nominated him.\nThe only other candidate, Ben\nHughes, decided to withdraw due to\nheavy academic commit tm ents. Sarah White, the ULU President,\ntold Felix that she and the rest of the\nULU staff were \"very pleased\" with\nthe result and looking forward to the\nyear ahead. Ms White will be training Nick Dearden, who starts on\nMonday, in his role as VicePresident responsible for Finance\nand Services, and it is hoped that\nULU will soon be running smoothly.\nBookstore tender begins ANDREW SMITH\nThe tendering process for the new\nbookstore, to be situated within the\nnew library developments, starts\ntoday with the official unveiling of\nCollege invitation for tenders. Just\nsix organisations are being invited to\nbid for the site with College insisting\nthat money alone will not be the\ndeciding factor.\nNick Black, College's Estates\nManager, looks forward to the establishment of 'an academic bookshop\nof the highest quality'. Imperial\nCollege Union faces stiff competition from Blackwells, Waterstones,\nDillons, WH Smiths and Foyles in\nthe race to provide IC students with\ntextbooks. Mr Black has confirmed\nthat when the new shop opens next\nEaster, the current ICU bookstore on\nthe walkway will no longer be\nallowed to handle academic books.\nThe Estates Manager, who took\npart in the Rector's Ad-hoc Advisory\nGroup on the new Bookstore, insists\nthat College is 'very happy with the\ncurrent ICU bookstore', but suggests\nthat their current location is not ideal.\nHe maintains that the winning bid\n'should be run to the best advantage\nof the College community'.\nWith this in mind ICU President\nEric Allsop argues that all profits of\nbook sales should be kept within the\nCollege community. He points out\nthe all revenue from ICU outlets goes\ninto improving facilities within the\ncampus. Mr Allsop gives the recent\nrefurbishment of the Ents Lounge to\nbecome dB's, using \u00a340,000 of\nbookstore profits, as a prime exam-ple.\nBids will be received in early\nNovember with the screening and\ninterview process being conducted\nby a panel lead by the Dean of\nImperial College School of Medicine\nat The NHLI, Prof Clarke. His group\nwill include Prof Alan Swanson, ProRector Educational Quality, Mike\nHansen, Director of Finance, Ian\nCaldwell, Director of Estates and\nMagda Czigany, Director of Library\nServices. Prof Swanson will appoint\none student to also sit on the panel.\nUniversitas 21\nKENT YIP\nA new international organisation of\nsuper-institutions, known as\n\"Universitas 21\", will be formed\nearly next year. The idea was initiated by the University of Melbourne in\nAustralia, and is scheduled to be in\nplace by March.\nBritish Universities provisionally\nsigned up to be members include\nBirmingham, Nottingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The new grouping has been described as \"a network of universities that share similar interest\" primarily aiming to\nexchange information, students, and\nshare their resources. All members\nof the group are from Commonwealth nations. Moreover, they must\nalso be research based, multi-disciplinary, and have a medical school.\nCloser to home, there has been no\nmove by Imperial College to join\nthis particular group, though it\nalready belongs to several international organisations. One of these,\n\"Caesar\", co-ordinates all the leading engineering colleges in Europe\nand was previously chaired by Prof\nHolmes of the Civil Engineering\nDepartment.\nCharing Cross\nsuicides\nCharing Cross Hospital, whose medical school is scheduled to become\npart of Imperial College in 1998, is\nunder investigation after a report in\nTime Out exposed a number of\nrecent suicides. Delays of up to five\nhours have been reported in the\nadmission of patients to the hos pi tal's casualty department, often leading to psych riat ric patients causing\nthemselves damage.\nOne female patient gave up waiting and proceed to take a taxi to\nLondon Bridge where she jumped\noff, her body being found ten days\nlater.\nUnder the former management,\npsychiatric patients were not abandoned to wait in casualty. Private\nsecurity contractors, introduced in\n1992, have been criticised for not\nbeing allowed to help patients in crisis situations such as these.\nWith three other suicide cases in\nthe past year, one where a man\njumped from the top floor of the hos-pital, it has been admitted that a 'tower block is obviously inappropriate for psychiatric patients.'\n\n"

Sadness over\nclosure of 'excellent'\nMontpelier Hall\nANDREW SMITH\nCollege's only dedicated postgraduate Hall of Residence is to close in\nSeptember 1997 with the loss of 75\nbeds. At a time of increasing pressure\non College bed spaces, senior academics have expressed concern that the\naccommodation of postgraduate\nfresher s may drop in priority.\nMontpelier Hall, originally built as\na nurse's hostel for what is now the\nLanesborough Hotel, is suffering\nfrom increasing dilapidation, and\nCollege's Management Planning\nGroup decided that its closure could\nno longer be delayed. The decision\nwhether to sell or renovate it, with\nminimum estimates for the latter\noption running at \u00a3600,000, will be\ntaken by MPG before Christmas.\nDr Richard Clarke, warden of\nMontpelier, expressed sadness that\nwhat he views as an 'excellent hall'\nshould be closed. While the sale of\nthe Knightsbridge property has been\non the cards for some time, Dr Clarke\nsuggested that the disappearance of\nseventy five beds would still be 'a great loss'.\nDespite the small rooms, for which\nthe hall is notorious, the warden\ninsisted that the large recreational\narea makes Montpelier 'a very sociable place'. Dr Clarke also points to\nthe fact that it was purpose built as a hostel, as a reason to keep\nMontpelier within the College port-folio.\nNick Black, College's Estates\ncontinued on page two\nPHOTO: ROBIN RILEY\nThe first week of the new term has been a complete success with an enormous response to all the Freshers' events. The Friday night 'Freshers'\nCarnival' (scene of the laser show above) was no exception with tickets\nbeing sold out by Thursday lunchtime. This was the first carnival ever to\ndo so.\nTakings at Da Vinci's bar reached record levels with substantial\namounts being spent over the course of the evening. \"People arrived earlier and stayed the distance\", observed Mark Horne, the Union Events\nand Marketing Manager. Southside also had a good night, the bar being\ndescribed as 'teeming'. The new dB's ents lounge has been hailed as a most worthwhile addition to the facilities the Ents crew have to work\nwith. \" A better venue to host better events\" commented Mark. \"The\ncapacity of the Union has expanded over the last year and possible plans\nto open other areas of the building are in the pipeline.\" Sarah Ewen\nBeercan potshot alarms\nMews residents\nMARIA IOANNOU\nLocal residents were shocked and\namazed this week after their preferred quiet life was shattered by the\ncasual ballistics of a Southside guest.\nA drunken reveller was observed\nthrowing a full can of beer into one\nof the exclusive mews houses behind\nSouthside.\nThe can was thrown from the top\nfloor of Tizard Hall and crashed\nthrough the front room window of a house in Princes Gate Mews at about\nmidnight, breaking two panes of\nglass and terrifying the resident, who\nwas present in the room.\nThe Warden of Tizard Hall,\nDr.John Hassard, spoke of his horror\nsaying \".. .it could have killed some-one... a terrible thing to have hap-pen ed.\" Friday night's occurrence was not\nan isolated incident and in the past\nsome residents have asked for the\nwindows to be boarded up or netted,\nbut this would be in breach of fire\nregulations and cannot be done.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 18TH OCTOBER NEWS 3\nJudo session enlivens Elections\nKENT YIP\nImperial College Union's Council\nline is almost complete after elections held at its first meeting of the\nyear. Two officers and seven ordinary members were elected at the\nmeeting last Tuesday, but the last\nminute withdrawal of candidate\nEmma Dedman still leaves the position of Welfare Officer unfilled.\nHeather Whitney, the sole candidate for the post of Womens' Officer,\nwas unanimously elected. Her intention to organise self defence classes\nfor women and to set up specialist\nlibrary on women's issues in the\nUnion office were warmly welcome\nby the voters. The post of Transport\nOfficer was likewise taken up by\nDuncan Tindall after a relatively\nuneventful speech.\nThe two ordinary member positions reserved for fresher s were filled\nby Lloyd Kilford and Savas George.\nIn his speech, Lloyd, a maths and\ncomputing student, announced that\nhe found committee meetings \"inter-e sting\". He also has plans to convert\nthe top room in the Queen's Tower\ninto an observatory, and to raise the\nprofile of the second hand book shop\nin the Physics department.\nMeanwhile, the less than lukewarm enthusiasm of postgraduates to\ntake a more active role in the running\nof Council meant that nobody was\nproposed before the start of the meet-ing. Paul Brown, former Transport\nOfficer and current head of IC Radio,\neventually \"volunteered\" for the\nposition. Confronted with the problem of finding a partner to take up the\nremaining PG post, Paul remained\noptimistic, highlighting the large\nnumber of postgraduates currently\ninvolved in the running of clubs and\nsocieties.\nWith medics from St. Mary's taking their usual active role in events,\neight candidates stood for the\nremaining four ordinary member\npositions. These elections saw their\nnumber on the Council increase from\nfour to six with Sarah Edwards, the\nformer President of St Mary's Hospital Medical School Student's Union, and WD Miles, elected as\nordinary members with the greatest\nnumber of votes. In their absence, for\nacademic reasons, current president\nof Mary's SU, Sami Ansari spoke on\ntheir behalf.\nRob Park's bid for election was\nhampered by a suspicion that he had\neaten all the pies during his time on\nthe Refectory Services Committee.\nHannah Pearson, a third year\nChemical Engineering student, and\nMatt Szyndel, a fourth year Physics\nstudent, were however eventually\nelected.\nDuncan Tindall, John Lambert,\nTom Gallaford and Caroline Deetjen\nwere elected from the Council to the\nExecutive Committee of the Union.\nDuncan Tindall, the only one of the\ncandidates to be interrogated, faced a barrage of questions on how he\nwould deal with the problems of lack\nof space in the BMS building and the\nconsequential overload on current\nfacilities.\nThree proposed Union policy documents also saw their first reading at\nthe Council meeting, with all but one\nmaking it through. A number of\nflaws and omissions resulted in the\nICU Publicity Policy being withdrawn for reworking.\nThe new Clubs and Societies\nSafety Policy, written over the\nSummer by Sarah Corneille, faced\neven more opposition. Debate\nfocused on the extensive new conditions placed on off-campus activities.\nThese include a requirement that\nseven days notice must be given to\nthe Deputy President Clubs and\nSocieties (DP C&S) 'before any trip\ncan proceed'.\nAlso debated was the proposed\nDisciplinary Policy, which will allow\nthe Appeals procedure to impose\nincreased penalties on students.\nCouncil members eventually agreed\nunanimously to this measure, as the\nJudo session proceeding in the room\nabove added to the excitement.\nMORGAN SlW!B3E%i IpOrgan Stanley is^^^fe-g global in ves l men lf bank that engages in an integrated range of\nactivities: InvestrrjsbfcBanking, Asset\nManagement and S a l^^^^^ing.
