    "content": "medical/welfare and Union places in Hall. On the positive side,\nserious investigations are taking place into the building of a new hall\non Northside, above the Sports Centre, which will hopefully house\naround 125 students. This is be com nga matter of extreme urgency,\nparticularly in view of the impending plight of Head Tenancies.\nOn the financial side, the rents for next session have yet to be fixed,\nmainly because there are too many unknowns at the moment to make\na sensible decision. Conferences continue to utilise student\naccommodation, but it is still not clear as to whether they pay a true\nrate for the usage, part icu al rly in view of the fact that certain\nupgrading s, charged to the account, are quite clearly attributable to\nconference requirements.\nThe SRC reserve has, thankfully, been preserved as an investment\nfor future residences and will not be used to fund fire and public health\nstatutory requirements.\nOn the whole, an industrious year, but there are so many problems\nstill to be tackled effectively.\nWardens Sub-Committe\nThis is a recently devised sub-committee of the Student Residence\nCommittee that invites all of the Hall, House and Head Tenancy\nWardens, as well as a few other people, to discuss the real nitty-gritty\nproblems of residences as a whole as well as in particular. In addition,\nSRC can refer work to it, for instance sorting out the problems and\nlack of working telephones in residences, Southside fire alarms etc.\nTo my mind, this has been quite a useful talking shop that does have\none or two teeth. Perhaps as if en vol ves, a few more teeth could be\nadded.\nServices\nUnion Snack Bar\nFollowing the take-over of the College run refectory in the Union\nbuilding, we have staffed and equipped what has proven to be a popular and lively snack bar which to-date, has been able to cover\ncosts. This is in no small way due to the efforts of Norman, Julie and\nthe student staff who have put a huge amount of effort into making the\nsnack bar a success.\nIt would appear that the current menu satisfies quite varied tastes\nand from time-to-time is added to according to demand. If anyone has\nany suggestions or complaints Norman or any of the sabbaticals\nwould be pleased to hear from you.\nSTA Travel Office\nInto its second year of operations, the travel office in the JCR seems\nto be providing a good, comprehensive travel service, ranging from\nNational Express tickets to Skiing hol days. For those members of staff and students who haven't ventured into\nSTA, pop in some time and see what they can do for you.\nTelephones\nFollowing the installation of a new exchange in the College and the\nchanging of numbers and classification of all phones, the system now\nseems to have settled down to a reasonably stable level.\nHowever, after repeated attempts and memos numerous to mention\neither the new-f angled, all-singing , all-dancing exchange is not\ncapable of simple time and STD restrictions or the\nTelecommunications manager is using the memos, which incidentally\nare designed to save money, as a door-stop. I really fail to understand\nhow , in a College of Science and Technology, such simple technical\nmatters are more difficult to achieve than climbing Everest.\nItems and Events\nUniversity Challenge\nImperial College was invited to take part this year, and our team\ncomprised Dick Langstaff (Captain), Humanities, Tim Williams,\nMining PG, Simon Errington, Min Tech PG and Duncan Swan, Chem\nEng 1 with Steve Parr, Physics 3 as reserve.\nThe team proved to be very strong with each member having a definite part to play. Along the way, Somerville College Oxford,\nQueen's University Belfast, Birmingham and Edinburgh were\ndefeated resulting in a final against Jesus College Oxford.\nIC were disp pointed not to have won outright but none-the-less\nproduced a commendable performance to reach the final, a feat that is\na first for the College.\nIncost\nThe 1985 International Confernce on Science and Technology was\nto have been hosted by IC Union over Easter, with the subject of\nBiotechnology as the main theme.\nAfter having committed a large amount of time and other resources\nto organise the conference, the response from delegates of member\ninstitutions was, to say the least, disappointing. Because of this, the\nconference was cancelled at the begining of March and arrangements\nare to date, being made to select the host for the 1986 conference.\nMy thanks must go to the College for their promised support, and\nderision to three people who enthused about our hosting the event and\nfailed to pay more than lip-service to the hard work required in\norganising it.\nHon Porn Night\nThis event, whichever side of the fence one sits on, caused\nconsiderable con tro very this year, much more so than in previous\nyears. The College, ICU as well as R SMU, bore the burnt of national\nand international notoriety on a scale that was quite frightening in its\npossible consequences.\nAt the t welt h hour the event was cancelled by the organisers with the\nstated intention that this event, in its present format, would not take\nplace again on College or Union premises.\nCollege\nRefectory Refurbishment\nThroughout the year there has been discussion about redesigning\nand refurbishing the main College refectories in the Sherfield Building\nwhich culminated in plans and proposals being put to the Hustings\nU GM for approval (details attached in minute book).\nApproval in principle was given by the U GM that it is feasible to\nswop the J CR for the Main Dining Hall, so long as sufficient attention\nis paid to recreating a new J CR and is not just an after-thought.\nNext years Exec will have to pay particular attention to the\nevolution of these plans.\nThere is considerable scope within the plans to improve the quality\nof the food and service, as well as the surroundings. I just hope that\nfood and service remain high priorities for improvement and are not\nconfused with nice decor! Furthermore, I would hate to see the day\nthat the grossly indecent and uncomfortable fixed furniture that\ncurrently sprawls all over the Buttery is adopted for the new refectory.\nVarious people (who shall remain nameless) seem to think that it is\nmore important to be able to clean around furniture than the comfort\nand ease of the customers. Personally I prefer not to have to dislocate\nmy hips in order to be able to get into this type of fixed furniture.\nStudent Manadatory Awards\nIn November 1984, the government announced that it intended to\nsignificantly increase parental contributions towards the maintenance\ngrants, to abolish the minimum awards and more significantly, to\nmake parents pay tuition fees as well (in some cases).\nThe ensuing fur ore involving letters to MPs from students and their\nparents and demonstration in and around London forced a climb down by the Government as far as the tuition fees were\nconcerned.\nWhilst the NUS claimed a major victory, which in my opinion had\nvery little to do with efforts on their part, the result had implications as\nfar as UGC funding to Universities is concerned, particularly for\nequipment grants.\nI was actively surprised that NUS even realised that they ought to\nrepresent students and it only serves to confirm the view that IC is\nbetter off out of NUS.\nUGC Visitation, 6.2.85\nAs part of their fact finding tour, the full UGC descended upon IC\nwhere they met representatives of all sections of the College including\nstudents.\nThe main points that we wished to put across concerned the\nproblems of a com mod ation in South Kensington, the complete\nmismatch between grants in London and the true cost of living,\ninadequate sports and recreational fac il ties on campus and problems\nfaced by overseas student in this country and in London. In addition,\nthe student representatives discussed academic affairs and problems\nof lecturing standards, wastage rates and library facilities.\nIn general, I think that the UGC were enlightened and a little\namazed at some of the things we had to say, particularly regarding the\nproblems and cost of living and studying in London. However, it was\nmade quite clear that the UGC could and would not do anything to\nhelp facilities, particularly in the way of financial support, although\nthey remained sympathetic.\n\n"

    "content": "CLETTERS\nLetters\nRevolting\nDrivel\nDear Sir,\nI would like to record my protest at the\ninclusion of the review of ' A Festival of\nErotica' in last week's FELIX. There are two\nmain faults with this review:\n1 A review of 'entertainment' such as this\nmakes attendance at such an event seem\nnormal\u2014this type of show is attended by\nonly a small fraction of the population (see\nattendance at the Mines' Hon Porn Night), or\nare people like myself, who can restrain\nthemselves from thinking about sex 'once\nevery fifteen minutes' in the minority?\n2 In all the major newspapers, and Criticon\ntoo, each reviewer is named so that\ncomments and criticisms can be directed to\nthe right person. I would suggest FELIX do\nthe same thing, for the reason above, and also\nbecause I am curious to know who writes\nsuch an article!\nYours sincerely,\nThomas Yeung\nPhysics 2\nDear Editor,\nThanks for another interesting and\ninformative publication in the form of\nFELIX703. The reason for writing concerns\na feature which I believe severely blemishes\nthe said issue, and perhaps your good name\nalso (since there is no author associated with\nthe article in question).\nI must overcome the intense personal fear\nof being regarded as another Michael\nNewman, and make known my objections to\nthe 'Armchair Perverts' feature. Whilst\ncommending the author's literary qualities\nand entertaining style, I am neither endeared\nto this choice of subject nor impressed with\nhis extremely liberated attitude towards\npublication of obscenities. Possibly there is\nan audience for this kind of thing but I don't think this is really what most Imperial\nCollege students want to read (although I may be wrong).\nI do think that a public exhibition of this\nkind will discourage the 'better students'\nfrom considering Further Education at\nImperial College: it made me think again\nabout the type of people students at Imperial\nCollege are portrayed as.\nRespectfully,\nMalcolm Gray\nElec Eng\nDear Sir,\nShame on you for publishing revolting\ndrivel! 'Armchair Perverts' (10 May issue).\nOur Union newspaper can well do without\nsuch insulting and offensive articles.\nYours Sincerely,\nHilary Todd, Richard Rijnbeek, Neil Murphy,\nMalcolm Dunlop, Fran Bageneal, Janet\nYarker, Sandra Chapman\nHope\nDear Sir,\nHaving heard and read many dismal\nforecasts recently, I am using this column to\nshare the comforting hope which I have\nfound.\nThis hope arises through study of the Holy\nBible. It foretold, with reasons, the world\nsituation precisely. Read thoughtfully\nMatthew 24: 1-14, Luke 21:7-19, Timothy 3:\n1-7, and Revelation 6, then see if you can\ndeny the sign of Jesus' 'paro usi a '\u2014the Greek\nfor presence, especially of royalty.\nIt also foretells oncoming events. Check\nLuke 21: 28-33; that 'Thy Kingdom' in the\nLord's Prayer will globally annihilate\nwickedness soon (Psalms 37: 8-11, 27-29)\nleaving a cleansed earth.\nAre you laughing? You are proving true\nthe words at 2 Peter 3: 3-13.\nThe Bible is free and open to all. I 've\nmentioned a couple of aspects but there are\nso many more. Come along Sunday 9.50am to Kingdom Hall, Pond Place\u2014just off\nFulham Road, South of South Kensington\nTube, totally without obligation. At worst\nyou can broaden your general knowledge\u2014at best you can gain peace of\nmind and a better life.\nYours after serious study,\nM Hayes\nComputing 2\nBloody mess\nDear Sir,\nTuesday was the RCS Exec initiation.\nMembers of the committee decided to wash\noff paint, blood etc, and, although not\nresidents used the first-floor ladies bathroom\nof Beit. This bathroom was left in a disgusting and nauseating state\u2014with blood\nstains on the floor, six inch tide-marks on all\nthree of the baths and solid clots of blood on\nthe shower floor. The smell is overpowering.\nWhilst I recognise any particular group of\npeople have the right to get totally drunk out\nof their minds and take part in such mindless\npractices I do feel that to inflict them on the\nrest of the College is disgusting, diabolical\netc.\nYours,\nChristine Spears\nPhysics 1\nFELIX\nIn the middle of FELIX this week you will\nfind the annual report of IC Union. Twelve\npages of close type, it's not compelling\nreading.\nUnfortunately, persistence in straining\nyour eyes to read it all is scant ly rewarded.\nThe reports conform to the format of last\nyear's and the year before\u2014a list of all the\nCollege and Union committees with a brief\ndescription of what they are. The reports\nmake interesting reading, though, when they\ndepart from this format and the sabbaticals\nwrite about what they have actually achieved.\nEric Darbyshire's report is much the best\nin this rep ect \u2014he has written at length about\nhis own areas of responsibility\u2014insurance,\ntransport, etc. He has also been quite honest\nabout what he hasn't achieved!\nAs a whole, though, the Union has\nachieved quite a lot this year and it's a shame\nthat the annual report doesn't reflect these\nsuccesses more vividly.\nOne interesting difference in opinion between\nthe sabbaticals can be seen from the reports.\nIan says:\n'The role of the U GM still remains as\nimportant as ever...', Eric says 'I sometimes\nwonder if there is any point in UG Ms at all.'.\nDave Parry doesn't seem to acknowledge\nthe existence of UG Ms at all, in his report.\nUG Ms are a waste of time. The only\njustification for keeping them is that on the\nrare occasions that you need them, they are\nthere.\nRag Fete last week was the most enjoyable\nfor years. As well as being good fun it raised\n\u00a3700 for charity\u2014not bad considering the\nweather.\nThe success was largely due to the hard\nwork of the 'hacks' about whom M Preen\ncomplains in his letter on page 4. I would\npoint out that the same 'hacks' were still\nclearing up late into the night, long after Mr\nPreen had w hinged off home.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Kathy,\nChris, Gren, Pete, Nigel, Tom, Jon, John,\nDiane, Pete, Debbie, Ajay, Alan, Judith,\nSarah, all the colla tors and especially\nRosemary and Tony for working extra-hard\nthis week.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit.

Martin Bax leads a double life.\nNot unusual, perhaps. However, in both of his lives,\nhe is an editor. As Dr Bax,\npae dia tricia n, he is responsible for a learned medical\njournal; as Martin Bax, writer\nof short stories and two\nnovels, he edits Ambit,\naccording to the Observer, 'a sensible a van fe garde literary\nmagazine'.\nAmbit, now in its 25th year,\nis celebrating its 100th issue.\nIts many famous contributors\ninclude JG Ballard, Ivor\nCutler, Gavin Ewart, David\nHockney, Christoper Logue,\nMichael Moor cock, and Eduardo Paolozzi.\nAfter a quick sortie among\nthe Charing Cross Road\nbookshops, I divined that\nAmbit was sold at the Arts\nCouncil Shop in Long Acre.\nThere, I managed to get hold\nof what appeared to be the last\ncopy\u2014thick as a paperback,\nseemingly a snip at \u00a33.

Ambit is dominated by\npoetry\u2014an art form of which I increasingly suspect we\nscientists know little. However, I recognised Henry\nGraham's Ozy as a clever\nparody of Coleridge and I was\nintrigued by the Cento, a form\nof poetry composed of lines\nsnatched, magpie fashion, from the works of others. The\nCento goes back to the times\nof Homer, but the Centos by\nJames McLaughlin are fun to\nread and have a variety of\nsources.\nApart from poetry there are\ndrawings, including four\nHockney s and the RCA printmakers' exhibition( Barbican) in colour, and\nthere is prose\u2014Bax on beds,\nBallard quizzed, but big\nBlondes by Geoff Nicholson is\none of the funniest, oddest\nshort stories I have ever\nencountered.\nAmbit gives a glimpse of\nanother world\u2014literary and\nartistic, mature, self-secure.\nCertainly it is the world of\nanother generation from ours\n(and it is very different from\nThe Phoenix, rising next\nweek). If you have literary\npretensions, if you like poetry,\nif you wish you knew more\nabout poetry, then Ambit is\nworth a read.

    "content": "Whether or not the visit will prove beneficial to the College as a whole remains to be seen. In particular, the question remains as to\nwhether the UGC will continue to treat IC favourably in the way of\nincreased selective funding or less harsh cuts.\nTeaching Standards\nOne-fifth of our undergraduates fail to complete the course for which\nthey originally registered in the correct time. The UGC expressed\nconcern . The Union made criticisms. The Academic Affairs Officers\nand dep reps are fed up of complaining. ProfessorAnderson resigned.\nAnd what have the College done? Abolished the Education\nTechnology Committee, a committee specifically set up to examine\nways and means of helping and improving teaching standards.\nIt is quite clearly true that standards, vary from course to course,\nfrom department to department, with some being much, much better\nthan other. But until the complacent and unrealistic attitudes\npresented by some departments are overcome and until some\ncomparisons are done between courses and departments, the\nproblems are not going to cure themselves overnight by magic.\nThe problems of wastage rates are not solely due to teaching\nstandards. Conversion from 'spoon feeding' at 'A' level to lectures on\na degree course is not always an easy transition for students. It might\nbe worthwhile putting some resources into helping students to learn,\nparticularly in how to get te best for lectures and libraries.\nWhatever happens, something has to be done to stop the rot.\nStudents may choose not to come to Imperial because of the cost and\naccommodation problems of living in London. They sure as hell\nwon't come if there is a greater than one in five chance that they won't get a degree and/or if they are going to be lectured to by less than\nsatisfactory communicators.\nULU AND GUC\nGeneral Union Council is the ULU equivalent of our UGM but that\nis where the similarity ends.\nSo much time has been wasted on so many stupid, irrelevant,\ntrend ly left, non-student orientated motions that there is no time left\nto consider the plight of the lowly student. IC has consistently sent a full delegation to each and every meeting in the forlorn hope that\nsomething useful may be ac hived. However, future relationships and co-operation with ULU look to\nbe on the up, particularly in involvement with UL U and other\nColleges as far as the various purchasing consortia are concerned.\n\u2022 The ULU Summer Training School is a worthwhile affair that,\nwhilst having one or two bad points, serves several useful purposes.\nWillis Jackson Remedial Works\nFor one reason and another, the local authority served a writ on the\nCollege to commence remedial works on the fabric of Willis Jackson\nHouse, regarding fire precautions and public health requirements.\nThe original plans put forward by the Estates Section would have\ninvolved students having to vacate their rooms and move to other\nvacant rooms, some during the exam nation period. Obviously , this\nwas a less than ideal solution.\nAfter many discussion at low and high levels, a much more\namendable solution was agreed upon,whereby work would only be\ncarried out during vacations. Furthermore, a rolling plan to continue\nthis type of work on other housing in Evelyn Gardens, again to take\nplace during vacations, has been agreed by the College and the local\nauthority. 'A triumph for co-operation and common-sense'.\nHouse Wardens\nA great deal of time was spent at the end of last session and over the\nsummer in interviewing and appointing new wardens to all of the\nstudent houses. Most will now be coming to the end of their first year\nand I hope that they have enjoyed their job as well as progressing with\nother work (perhaps!).\nEvelyn Gardens is at last getting some work done to update and\nimprove faults after many years of sad neglect. This work is going to\ntake many years to complete but will none-the-less be carried out with\nminimal disturbance and disruption to residents.\nThe wardens seem to have been able to strike up a good working\nrelationship with the Managing Surveyor for Residences, Mr Peter\nHallworth which should bode well for the future.\nImpossible without:\nUnion Permanent Staff\nThis session commenced with five permanent members of staff to\nfind, including two for the Snack Bar and all but one was filled in time\nfor the start of session.\nIt is to their credit that they have settled in as well as they have and\nfor showing such enthusiasm and commit t ment that is all too often\ntaken for granted.\nIn the office, Kathy has settled in part icu aly well and provides a constant source of amusement for students and staff alike.\nWith Jen and Pat, the full complement of seven staff really do make\nthe Union work and I really couldn't have hoped for more loyal,\nunderstanding and hard working staff.\nDave and Eric\nTable tennis and Waitrose trolleys may be how Dave Parry and Eric\nDarbyshire will be remembered by you.\nTo me, these two have been absolutely superb companions and\nwork mates, never shying from the task in hand and always there with\nsuch enthusiasm and determination.\nFurther than this, I'm a bit lost for words. All I can say is, thanks\nlads\u2014few will every know how such praise and credit you actually\ndeserve. Two better sabbaticals you'd have difficulty in finding.\nI would also like to compliment Dave Rowe on his competent and\nprofessional work this year, as well as his time and efforts in\npublications since he has been at College.\nThe End\nThere are hundreds of people who should be thanked here and I apologies for not mentioning their names.\nI hope you will pardon a slight indulgence if I were to say that I have\nthoroughly enjoyed this year, much more so than I thought possible.\nFinally, my thanks must go out to John Smith, Peter Mee, Ieuan\nThomas and Ted Brown, all of whom have made a difficult time much\neasier at some stage or other.\nAnd so, it only remains to wish Carl, Dave, Quentin and Hugh\ngood luck for next year. I hope you enjoy your terms of office as much\nas I have. There are low points , but the high points more than\ncompensate.\nIan Bull\nAthletics Clubs\nAs chairman of the Athletic Clubs Committee, I feel that I should\nexpress my gratitude to the rest of the committee for their tolerance\nand hard work throughout the year, to cover up for my mistakes.\nWhen elected (unopposed), I did not have the first clue about the\nfunctions that the ACC fulfilled, so thanks must go to Andy, who did a brilliant job on UAU. when he was sober, Simon, who attended most\nICU council and finance meetings, Dave Chadwick for running the\nExec Meetings, Paul for transport, Jon for writing all the letters and\nKathy, the ladies Sports rep. Not to forget of course Phil and Francis\nfor their witticisms on Exec Meetings as well Garry Lawrence and\nCary McHale for representing ACC on College Committees. A special\nmention should be made of the Ladies Rugby and Netball captains\nwho kept me in line by constantly giving me a dressing down when I was not doing my job.\nClub results are always difficult to keep track of, due to the\ntendency of club captains to gloss over poor results, and to forget to\ninform us of good results. Mention must be made though of the\nVolleyball club which performed well in UAU again, Tennis club who\nmanaged their now annual UAU balls up though it was not as drastic\nas last year. Rugby Club inflicted more damage on opposition\nproperty than seemed possible, as well as 'borrowing' several items of\nequipment. Football Club, not to be outdone, scraped back in to the\nfirst division of the UL Leagues and Ten Pin Bowling, through the\nefforts of an enthusiastic club committee, had several good results in\ninter-university competitions.\nFinance for the academic year 85/86 is looking like being extremely\ntight. The last Union Finance Committee meeting imposed a \u00a312,000\ncut in ACC (approximately 20% of our grant) by cancelling tours and\nreducing travel subsidies . We shall have to wait and see if any further\ncuts will be imposed, before restructuring the ACC allocations for\n85/86.\nThe Univeristy Grants Committee visit in February proved to be\nfruitless, as the request for funds to build a new sports centre on\ncampus fell on deaf ears. However, there is aps sibi lit y that College\nwill take out a loan to finance a new sports centre, and several\nlocations are currently being considered.\n\n"

    "content": "Recreational Clubs Postgraduate Affairs\nOverall, the year, has gone very smoothly indeed. Initially there\nwere problems because the Vice Chairman elect had failed his exams\nand at the first U GM the prospective candidate withdrew. However\neventually Richard Collcott was elected with Charlie Pollock of Scout\nand Guide filling in in the interim.\nAs last year, chairman's information sheets were issued and, once\nagain, I feel that they have been a great success. In addition treasurer's information sheets in the same format were distributed and (for those\nwho bothered to read them) proved very useful.\nTwo first aid courses were run this academic year by Roger Serpell\nand both had RC C members on them (course fees paid out of RC C general funds). Overall the number of people taking up the offer of a free first aid course is up on last year but several clubs still obstinately\ncontinue to refuse this valuable option.\nSafety policy documents were once again collected from hazardous\nrecreational clubs and sent to College for information and approval.\nOnce again College did not have the common decency to acknowledge\neven the receipt of these papers let alone offer any feedback.\nFollowing the fur ore surrounding the Christmas 1981\nMountaineering Tour death, I had assumed that College were\nconcerned about safety. Now I believe that they nearly want to be seen\nto be concerned and care little for the quality of the measures carried\nout at their behest.\nThe principles of Safety policy documents (and free first aid\ncourses) were amongst several alterations made to the RC C Constitution and Standing Orders during the year. The changes\nserved to overhaul the Constitution and Standing Orders (a task last\nperformed in 1976) and enshrine a fair portion of RC C Policy in\nlegally binding black and white.\nClubs in general have ticked over very nicely this year with Brewsoc\nin particular doing well to survive following the resignation of their\nchairman early in October. Keep fit joined the ranks of RC C early in\n1985 and have proved extremely successful\u2014after much publicity in\nFELIX and via posters they now have nearly 100 members and hold\nthree meeting every week.\nThe problem of finance as ever cropped up with RC C suffering a cut\nof some \u00a3750 following the discovery of Christine Teller's misinterpretation of F and E minutes. This was successfully\naccommodated into the contingency budget of the RC C grant but\nonly by reducing tours to a mere 30% travel subsidy and by being very\nhard on supplementary claims. I shudder to think what traumas RC C will have to go through next year whilst the CCUs drink their way\nthough their sub vent ions. I have enjoyed two years as chairman of RC C except, find it\ndepress sing that so many club chairmen seem to take on their posts\njust as ego trips and in order to get a pot in the bar. Too often clubs\nseem to be brought to their knees by chairmen who just do not care or\nwho do not bother communicating with their executive.\nTo whoever takes the helm next year\u2014good luck!\nHugh Stiles\nAthletics Colours\nOverall, after a promising start the year has been somewhat\ndiss appointing as far as social events are concerned. On the academic\nfront some interesting developments have occurred in the latter part of\nthe year. I will try to review the year in more detail below.\nFinances\nLast year's Deputy President decided that PGs were an\ninconsequential part of College life and correspondingly cut our grant\nto \u00a3100. Some hurried meetings and delicate threats, sorry\nnegotiations, with the present sabbaticals restored us to a grant of\n\u00a3850 (some \u00a3400 up on the previous year!!) for the 1984-1985 session.\nMost of this money has been spent on sub sidi sing events run by both\nthe PG Committtee and departmental groups.\nSocial Events\nWe started the year with two very successful discos in the Holland\nClub. The Fireworks and Valentines parties at Silwood were much\nenjoyed by those who attended. A brewery trip to Youngs brewery,\nmemorable for Jim Brannigan's connection between a ram and\nPrincess Margaret and a number of departmental parties have also\nbeen well received. An end of year party and the Silwood, South Ken\ncricket match are still to be organised.\nPG Handbook\nThe Postgraduate Handbook made its debut this year and has been\nwell received from all quarters. Congratulations and thanks to Hugh\nStiles for all his hard work.\nAcademic Affairs\nThe College received a slap on the wrist about PG supervision and\nthesis completion rates from the U GC.I am glad to say that the\nGraduate Studies and Board of Studies Committees are now\ninvestigating these problems and a documented set of guide lines for\nsupervisors and students alike should soon be produced.\nIC Union\nPGs have been well represented on most of the Union Committees.\nIt is apparent however that many of these are leaving or 'retiring' this\nyear and it is important that PGs involved in various union activities,\ntake posts of responsibility, so we may continue to be suitably\nrepresented.\nThe Future\nIt has become apparent during my two years as PGA O that\npostgraduates do not respond to large College run events and in the\nfuture departmental run events are the way for PGs to get together out\nof working hours. I shall be fading into obscurity at the end of this year\nand try to find my way back to the lab. A meeting will be held at the\nend of June to elect a new Chairman and committee. These are\nimportant, interesting and not least, enjoyable posts. If anybody is\ninterested please see me as soon as possible so I can give you more\ndetails. I wish those elected the best of luck!\nThanks\nI should like to thank, this years committee, especially Jim\nBrannigan, for his hard work as treasurer for the last two years. Andy\nHamilton and the residents at Silwood for continuing to invite us to\ntheir excellent events. The staff and sabbaticals in the union office for\ncontinuing to monitor my drinking and betting habits. Finally all\nthose people who have attended the events and socials we have\norganised and made the job worthwhile.\nChris Hendy PGAO 1984/85\n\n"

    "content": "Deputy President\nDeputy President's report continued from page 13\nGoverning Body/Finance & Executive\nThese committees consist of outside people who are the top body in\nIC. Their meetings are useful for us, for although we are only\nobservers we are given plenty of chance to express our views and pin\ndown College officers on points we think are relevant. This is one of\nour advantages when facing a hard time\u2014we can draw on a good\nquestion at these committees to show that someone is not pulling their\nweight.\nCollege House Committee\nA most useful one. The highest admin committee. The members are\nsenior enough to ensure that only the truth comes out under\nquestioning. Although nothing major has been initiated this year it\nprovides a great opportunity to pin down those who are not pulling\ntheir weight.\nIC Bookshop\nThis is owned jointly by ICU and the CCUs. It has grown up from\nbeing primarily a second-hand books tall to a modern specialist\nbookshop and stationers.\nUnfortuanetly the management ofthe bookshop seems to be stuck\nin a rut constrained by the level of staff and its sometimes my te riou s relation to ICU. Hopefully the profit made by the Bookshop will\nreoccur as a result of the changes made by the committee. The\nsports hop is not proving to be a success even given the lean time until\nprofits will be realised, predicted by various predecessors. To succeed\nit must gain more publicity to gain the turnover it needs to gain\nprofitability. A better site would do it no harm either.\nSTA\nThis year STA have proved themselves a competent firm in dealing\nwith our students. I have received no complaints from students about\nthem and Dick Porter has displayed great patience and understanding\nwhen dealing with College cock-ups.\nEstates Section\n(See also house committee)\nDue to the di lig ance of our accountants, this year we have been\npresented with large bills some dating back to 1981-1982 before many\npresent st due nts arrived at this College. Tracing back to the original\norders and quotes has been made more difficult and supporting\ndocumentation seems to be hard to get out of Estates. We have in at\nleast two cases been reduced to the level of waiting for the DP of those\nyears deciphering the claims for us.\nIt is incredible that bills for several thousands of pounds can lie\nunsent and ignored for so long. For us to plan any kind of expenditure\non this building we need to have bills quickly so that the people who\nordered the work can be around to inspect it and authorise the\npayment to the contractors.\nFinance Section\nThere are some people in this section who help us enormously. But\nothers do not seem to care that their handling of our officers and\naccounts bring us great hassle and trouble. Many things have occured\nmainly involving the Union accounts, where VAT seems to be\narbitrary and people going off sick seem not to be able to be replaced\nto carry on for a week or so. Brian Llowd Davis and Terry Neville have\nbeen particularly helpful this year in helping us with the snack bar and\nbookshop.\nGeneral Thanks\nPhysics, for allowing me to pass a degree course. R CSU, for making\nme into a hack. Chris Teller, for being helpful even after I'd been\nelected. Ieaun Thomas for the late bar licences, and Eric, Ian, Dave,\nJen, Pat and Kathy for their friendship and support.

    "content": "Athletics Committee\nThis is a sub-committee of the Governors, that oversees the running\nof Harlington, the Sports Centre and the Boathouse through its own\nsubcommittees.\nAthletic Ground Committee\nAs its name implies, this committee looks after Harlington, the\nCollege sports go und near Heathrow. To my mind, the College\nbureaucracy has failed to reach this committee, as many decisions are\nquickly and easily carried out. It is particularly pleasing to see that the\nreduction in Bar prices last session has been maintained during this\nyear.\nMick and Ann Reynolds continue to give good service, for which we\nall owe our thanks.\nWelfare\nThis appears to be much more of a talking shop than an action\ncommittee, with representatives of the Health Centre, Student\nServices, Student Counsellor, Day Nursery and the College Tutor as\nChairman. It does however allow problems that have been\nexperienced by one sector to be aired so that others may be better\nprepared should the same problems reoccur. A useful and informative\ncommittee.\nCentral Libraries\nAt the start of session, it was felt that the opening hours of the\nHaldane reading room were not as acceptable as they had been and\nthat insufficient money was available for the purchase of fiction stock.\nRemedies for both required money, and I would like to record\nthanks, particularly to the College and to Prof ET Brown for their\nhelp.\nWith the installation of a new security barrier at the Haldane/Great\nHall entrance, the opening hours have been restored to their former\nglory ie the same as those of the Lyon Playfair, and an extra grant has\nbeen made for the purchase of books.\nThe Lyon Playfair is currently installing a computerised lending\nsystem that should speed up and simplify the loan of books. This\nshould be ready for the start of next session.\nBoard of Studies\nThe Board of Studies is the top forum for academic matters and\nreports to the Governing Body, under the Chairmanship of the\nRector.\nThe year started dismally with the abolition of the Joint Honours\nCourse between Chemistry and Management Science, a worthwhile\nand popular course, brought in through the back door.\nThroughout the year reports have been received accompanied by\ngloomy statistics from admission, wastage rates, and PhD submission\nrates. The problems have been noted but little positive action seem to\nhave come out of it. My report elsewhere goes into much more detail\nas regards teaching standards.\nOne positive step was the inclusion of the PG Chairman as an extra\nstudent observer on Board of Studies.\nGraduate Studies\nA sub-committee of the Board to discuss matters of an academic\nnature relevant to postgraduate courses and education at the College.\nThe main topic for discussion this year been the 'nature of a PhD',\nin so far as what a PhD is meant to be, what the College should expect\nfrom its PhD students and what the students should expect to get out\nof a PhD.\nSecondly, the assessment of PhD and the role of the supervisor in\nthe assessment has been discussed in quite some detail. In particular,\nthe College has chosen to differ quite significantly from the CVC P guidelines and from the University of London in the role of the\nsupervisor in PhD assessment.\nGraduate studies committee also recommended to the Board of\nStudies that, apart from under exceptional circumstances,\npostgraduate students should be registered for the MPhil degree in the\nfirst instance and to be 'upgraded' to PhD after around 12 months on\nsatisfactory performance.\nMany thanks, to Chris Hendy and Hugh Stiles for their time and\neffort on this committee.\nCommittee on Overseas Students\nThe original remit for this Committee had centred around the\nwelfare of Overseas students. Recently, this has been extended to\ninclude recruitment which in certain ways, is incompatible with\nwelfare.\nThe most recent meetings have centred around the report and\nconclusions of the recent recruitment visit to Malaysia and Singapore,\nsome of which we found to be quite hypocritical and distasteful.\nFollowing the comment and criticism raised, it is to be hoped that\nthese point have been noted for the future recruitment of overseas\nstudents.\nRefectory Committee\nThis committee has again provided the focus for the activities of\nCatering, Bars, Shop and Wine Cellar as well as a policy making body\nfor the refectory system as a whole.\nThe computer is ation of the refectory stocks has gone from a serious\nproposition to a sick joke. Even with the threats of a misconceived\nRefectory boycott hanging over their heads, the refectory system has\nfailed to install and implement what would be a trivial problem for any\nundergraduate in the College. I'm sick to the back teeth of\ncomplaining about this and other fundamental weaknesses, as I'm sure Dr Perry, the Chairman is of hearing me. This whole facade is\npathetic! With all due respect to Simon and the hard work he puts into\nrefectories, the pleasing generation of a small surplus on the catering\nside is in my opinion more due to luck than good management. How\nthe hell can anyone expect to manage an operation of this scale when\nthe right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and when\nstocks and accounts are only accurately known well after the time that\nany effective manage mem nt interpretation and control could be\neffective.\nIt is pleasing to report that the price rise for student catering has\nbeen kept as low as possible, and has been limited to only one this year.\nI'm sure that any amount of computer is ation( whilst not being apa nance a for management faults) can only help to reduce the guess\nwork involved.\nAlso pleasing is the close collaboration with the Estates Section in\nrepairing small but niggling faults promptly.\nOn the whole, a small but pleasing amount of progress has been\nmade but there is acres of room for improvement. Mr Northey can\nhardly fail to make a positive impact on refectories.\nSuggestions, Complaints and Shop Committees\nAs its name implies, this is a committee that should take note and\nact upon suggestions and complaints for the College refectories as well\nas Southside Shop.\nIn my opinion, complaints about the quality of the food should be\nmade to the manager on duty at the time and place of purchase. It's all\nvery well having a letter to say that such and such a food portion was\ncold, or small, or whatever, but proves little satisfaction for the\ncustomer and not age at deal that Refectories can do days or even\nweeks after the date.\nThere have been two failings of this committee this year. One has\nbeen that there has been no official Chairman, which negates any\ncontinuity that it ought to have. The other is that some, (not all) of the\nRefectory managers pay little more than lip service to this committee.\nStudent Residence Committee\nResidences this year have been besotted with problems, large and\nsmall.\nThe year commenced with yet more complaints about the fire\nalarms in Southside , which to date are not perfect but are a significant\nimprovement on their past performance. Security in Southside again\nreared its ugly head, and was supposedly going to be cured once and\nfor all by the use of an electronic key card system. What a farce!\nPutting the key card in was no problem. Turning the damn thing\nrequired two hands and a couple of years' experience of weight\ntraining. The next refinement was an electrically operated door bolt\nand a nice flashing red light that flashes when the door is left open. It\nwould use less bulbs if it flashed when the system works! Yet another\ntrui mph for a College of Science and Technology.\nApart from technical cock-ups, there have been a number of\nadministrative changes this year. A non-residential housekeeper has\nbeen introduced to Linstead Hall. Montpelier now has a postgraduate\nwarden. A discipline tribunal for residence matters has been\nintroduced. (This will need careful monitoring by next year's Exec).\nNext session will be a difficult year for residences, with the loss of\nthe Fremantle and Lexham Gardens. To meet the existing guarantees\nto new students, considerable reorganisation in residence places was\nrequired, involving are duc it on in the number of re-applicants,\n\n"

    "content": "The Department of Aeronautics,\nwhich is one of the smallest\ndepartments in College, does much\nwork with Fluid dynamics which is\nof general application, and it is the\nexpertise that has been built up in\nwind tunnel design that has lead to ap rest igo us contact with Honda.\nThe Department is also involved in\nthe design of a new real-time\nSimulator which represents a significant advance over\nconventional machines.\nONE OF THE WORLD'S most sophisticated\nwind tunnels is being constructed in the\nDepartment of Aeronautics at Imperial\nCollege.\nIn recent years the Department has\nbecome increasingly interested in non-aeronautical work, including road vehicle\naerodynamics. This particular interest really\nbegan with tests carried out on racing cars,\nwhich included some for formula one racing\nteams like Ferrari, Lotus, and Williams.\nThere is already a wind tunnel in the\nDepartment which can be used for up to one-fifth scale testing, but it is in such demand\nfrom racing and sports car manufacturers\nthat a great strain is being put on its\ntraditional use for teaching and research.\nAlso Dr Peter Bearman and Dr John Harvey\nare inters ted in extending their research\nactivities to cover the fundamentals of air\nflow around cars, so there is a real need for\nnew facilities.\nThe new wind tunnel forms part of a joint\nproject involving the College and the\nJapanese car company Honda. There is a five\nyear contract with Honda, which includes\ntwo years for the construction of the tunnel,\nand three years for research. At the end of the\nfive year contract the wind tunnel will\nbecome the property of Imperial College. It is\nunusual for Japenese firms to place contracts\noutside of Japan, and the good reputation the\nCollege has built up in this area of work must\nhave influenced their decision. But also,\nwithin the College as a whole, there is a drive\ntowards increasing links with industry both\nin this country and abroad.\nThe tunnel has been specifically designed\nto carry out road vehicle aerodynamics\nstudies. It has a test section 5 feet high by 10\nfeet wide by 30 feet long with the capability to\ntest one-third scale models, and a maximum\nwind speed of 35m/ sec. A moving ground\nfacility based on a conveyor belt system\nmeans the effect of travelling along the\nground can be simulated, as well as the effect\nof moving through air. It is also possible to\nrotate the moving ground facility to obtain\nthe effect of cross winds. So conditions that\nmay be encountered in real-life situations can\nbe closely reproduced. The whole system is\ncomputer controlled, and it will be possible\nto measure wind forces on the cars, and a detailed pressure distribution on the models\nand in the surrounding air flow.\nIn the past much of the research on\npassenger cars has been directed at reducing\ndrag and so conserving fuel. But as fuel costs\ncontinue to rise car manufacturers are\nconsidering making more lightweight cars\nusing new materials. It is conceivable that the\nweight of cars may be halved, in which case\nthe design will need to be carefully studied to\nensure stability and safe handling. One of the\nmajor areas of research, using the wind\ntunnel, will be looking at the problems of\ndriving through cross winds, such as those\nencountered on motorways.\nIn a few days, work on the new wind tunnel\nshould be completed, and the res each can\nbegin.\nSimulated Excitement\nA high speed simulator, which will have a computing power to rival the largest computers\nin the world, is being developed by a team in the\nAeronautics Department.\nThe use of simulators for a wide range of\ntasks is on the increase. They are used to design\nand test mathematical models of aircraft so\nthat prototypes are right first time. These\ncomplete models are so complex that using\nexisting simulators it may take many computer\nhours to replicate a manoeuvre of only a few\nminutes or seconds. Real-time simulators are\nused to train pilots and crews. Modern\nsimulators are limited by their relatively slow\nspeed of computation, with the computer's version of the aircraft's movement only\nupdated about 30 times a second. There is a need to update at least 1,000 times a second,\nparticularly for helicopter simulation.\nThe team headed by Mr Belcher is in the\nearly stages of developing a real-time\nsimulator with the capability of handling 1,000\nmillion operations a second. It will be possible\nto simulate 900 processes simultaneously with\na high volume of data traffic between them.\nWith around 1,000 updates a second it will be\nover 30 times faster than existing machines,\nand it will be far cheaper because it is\nspecifically dedicated to this type of\ncomputation. It will have potential application\noutside of aeronautics, and there is interest in\nusing it to model the spread of disease through\npopulations.\n6 Friday 17 May 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS!]\nCHRISTIAN UNION\nWhy the\nCross?\nThis year the CU has been particularly active\nin College\u2014both through publicity and in\nactivities such as meetings and study groups.\nIn all the flurry of activity the outline of the\ncross will have been pertinent to observers.\nIndeed-these days many people wear a cross\naround their neck as a piece of jewellery. Yet\n2000 years ago this cruciform represented\nhorror, suffering and death\u2014the cross was\nthe most horrific piece of Roman execution\never devised. Where is the beauty in that?\nAnd why do Christians parade this as the\nsymbol of their faith?\nMany questions surround one cross in\nparticular. The crucifixion of Jesus\nChrist?\u2014Why did he die? Why did such a just and peaceful man have to die such an\nunjust and violent death? Was it a gross\nmiscarriage of justice\u2014or the Hope of the\nWorld?\nThis Friday, May 17 Paul Perkin, a local\nAnglican curate will give a personal view in a talk\u2014'Why the cross?' This one is worth\nmissing out on a few hours of revision (7pm, Union Dining Hall\u2014TODAY! Light buffet\nsupper provided: no charge)\nQ TSOC\n\u2022*s Shocker\nAnd lo,it came to pass that a mighty weekend\nwas had by all. The visitation ad Dominum\nBroadcastae Britanium went really well with\nyoung Martin being embarrassed in front of\n(well, strictly speaking, behind) hundreds of\npeople. Attendance at the Rag Fete was a little disappointing but it did even things up as\nthere were more pil locks from **s present\nthan there were mega heroes from QT.\nHowever we were, and still are, bigger then\nthem and they were well and truly\nvanquished in single combat.\nThis weekend brings the long awaited\npublic debut of the astounding Mr Graham\nShields\u2014a man barely alive, we have the\ntechnology, we can rebuild him, but we can't afford the materials.\nGraham will be at Speakers Corner on\nSunday at 3pm to display his incredible\ntalents. This time he will be there come what\nmay, riots, plague, shark infested custard, or\nabolition of the GLC, announcement of\nMount Pleasant as London's third airport, or\neven Everton winning the FA Cup. So be\nthere next Sunday to cheer Graham on.\n(Weather permitting).\nBIOTECH\nHands\noff\nmy\ngenes\nPatent Agent Peter Elliott gave a talk on\npatents in general and biotechnological\npatents in particular to the Biotech Society\nlast Monday. He made it clear that large new\nareas of innovation are being opened up in\nthe biotechnology field and that by their very\nnature patents are at the leading edge.\nPatents are a kind of bargain. In return for\npublishing an idea the inventor gets a monopoly for a number of years. The\ninventor can sell his monopoly or license it\nfor royalties. A topical example is that of very\nbroad patents that exist on a number of\ngenetic engineering techniques. The patents\nbelong to two American universities and are\nbeing challenged now by a big commercial\nfirm which is refusing to pay royalties. A legal\nbattle could be long, expensive, and highly\nsignificant for future research.\nGetting a patent is not a simple matter. An\ninvention must pass test of novelty, non-obviousness and applicability to be\nconsidered. The formulation of a patent is\ncritical, and Mr Elliott gave many examples\nof possible pitfalls.\nFortunatly in this country it is relatively\neasy to file a patent claim by handing in to the\npatent office a description of the invention,\nsomething saying you want to file a patent\nclaim and ten pounds. Such a claim\nestablishes priority of invention and gives\nprotection for a year. Mr Elliott encouraged\nanyone with an idea to consider taking this'\nstep. He did, however, point out that taking a patent to completion could take three or four\nyears and tens fo thousands of pounds. Most\napplicants are employers. Nonetheless,\nthere are laws to prevent inventors being\n'ripped off' by their employers or others.\nEstablished priority and protecting a research advantage are useful functions of\nthe first filing but problems arise about\npriority in an academic setting. Commercial\nprotectiveness present the free flow of ideas\nthat is normal in university res arch. Mr Elliott\nacknowledged that there was a conflict. The\nonly answer seemed to be to talk to few\npeople (and only in strict confidence) until a claim has been filed.\nDuring Mr Elliott's talk we heard about\ntwo kinds of overlapping Europe, The\nBudapest Treaty, patent for irrigating the\ndesert using snowballs from the South Pole\nand how inventors used to throw bricks\nthrough the patent office window in the dead\nof night watched by the police! (Round the\nbricks would be wrapped the patent claim\nand this could establish priority over a rival\nclaim the following day. Nowdays the patent\noffice is open all hours...). Mr Elliott's talk\nwas generally well received.\nNext Mondy May 20 The Biotech Society\nwill be presenting a talk on Biotechnology\nand the Food Industry by Prof R Righelato of\nTate and Lyle. Tate and Lyle is a sugar\ncompany that has diversified much in recent\nyears, so the talk should be of broad interest.\nVenue: Biochemistry Building, Link 4\nLecture Room, 5.45pm. ISLAMIC\nThe bad,\nthe worse\nand\nthe ugly\nThe 'sadistic cop' is the hero of most current\nTV cinema action films. He (or sometimes\none!) is very honest and in corrupt able but\nalso tough, yet ready to bend the law\nwhenever necessary to track down an 'evil'\nlaw breaker by adopting their violent and\nbloody methods. The theme is apparently\nthat unjust means are permissible in the\nquest for justice! Despite the obvious\ncontradiction in terms, this theme is still\nwidely accepted to the extent that it is rarely\nqueried.\nA more general question would be 'can the\nends justify the means?' The answer to such\na question is not straightforward, since it\nimplicit y assumes that 'ends' and'means'are\nseparable. Only when the aim is naively\ndefined does this appear to be true. 'All roads\nlead to Rome!' However, one aims to use the\nshortest, safest and easiest route, even if this\nis not explicitly stated. It is rather silly to\nserve the law by breaking it, or to serve the\ntruth by lying.\nOne of the major aims in life for a muslim is\nto keep to the straight path ie the good\nmeans of living are themselves 'aims'. A muslim asks his lord,\n'Guide us to the straight path...(Al-Qur'an\n1:6) a minimum of 17 times a day.\nFinally, everybody must realise that while\nit is 'bad' to have criminals, it is even 'worse'\nto have evil police, since the end result of a combination of the two can only be an 'ugly'\nworld.\nFELIX Friday 17 May 1985 19\n\n"

    "content": "Mud, mud,\nglorious mud\nNEWS!]\nIT CAME CLOSE to raining and\nit was bitterly cold which is\nprobably why only three hundred\npeople turned out for last\nSaturday's Rag Fete.\nDespite the bad weather nearly\n\u00a3700 was raised during the\nafternoon. The only mishap was\nbefore Lady Flowers opened the\nFete when a hundred people\nsneaked into the Queens Tower\nwhich was accidently left\nunlocked. In the spirit of Rag,\nnext year's Rag-chairman John\nIngham decided to charge 50p to\nlet people out. When someone\nrefused to pay John very\ngenerously invited them to jump\noff the Tower at no charge. The\nhighlight of the Fete was a mud-wrestling contest with Guilds\nPresident, Maribel Anderson\ntaking on anyone and everyone.\nDressed in a clinging swimsuit\nMaribel remained champ until\nGuilds President-Elect, Roger\nPreece clambered on top of her\nand pushed her shoulders below\nthe mud line. Among others\ncelebrities who took a bath (some\nmore willingly than others) was\nICU President, Ian Bull who was\nunceremoniously de bagged and\nleft lying face down and bare-cheeked. By the end of the\nafternoon dozens of people were\nwondering round the Queens\nLawn, some splattered and other\ncompletely covered with mud.\nThis gave rise to a new form of\n'hit' with mud-clad students\nbeing paid to hug people.\nAmong the other attractions\nwas the now t radi tonal fire-eating act. Last year's one figure\nhad multiplied into five daredevils who put on a stun n ning display The Royal School of\nMines Union presented their\ninfamous peep show, Debsoc had\na 'Rent an Argument' stall, food\nand drink appeared everywhere\nand IC Radio provided non-stop\nmusic. A rather more\nunorthodox stall was one called\n'Twat the Rat', where a rat was\nDuncan Moore-breathing fire\nput into the top of a tube and\npeople had to hit it with a stick\nwhen it slid out of the bottom.\nNeedless to say this particular\nstall did not last long since there\nwas only one rat.\nThe finale of the Fete involved\nICU President-elect Carl\nBurgess. Following in the\nfoot stop e of last year's Guilds\nPresident Mike Stuart, he\nvolunteered to have his head\nshaved by Maribel Anderson and\nended up looking like Mr T. Ian Bull, ICU President-naked swim in the mud\nBefore...\n1\ni \u2022after\nAnother 'true' story.\nThe Queen's Tower used to be\nopen all the time. However, when\nexam time came students used to\nhurl themselves off the top. One\nfrom the Physics department\nshouted Shrddinger's wave\nequation as he/she jumped.\nAnother time five Chinese students\njumped arm-in-arm, assuming\nthat they had failed their finals\nafter a particularly hard paper. In\nfact all had passed. Following this\nthe college authorities decided\nenough was enough, and closed it\nexcept for special occasions.\nExcept that no-one has ever\njumped off the top of the Queen's Tower.\nAny correspond ance about\nthis column should be addressed\nto me, The Apocryphist, c/o FELIX Office. I would be\nparticularly interested if anyone\nwants to bring a story to my\nattention.\nFELIX Friday 17 May 1985 5\n\n"

    "content": "Deputy President\nIntroduction\nThis report cannot hope to contain everything of significance that has\nhappened this year as that would probably fill a medium-sized book\nand also we three have worked on many things together so its not\nworth duplicating Ian's and Eric's reports on various bits.\nThe Union Building and House Committee\nThis year the plan was to redecorate the top floor and West\nStaircase. Having written to Estates Section for quotes, I got two\nreplies. One piece of work we decided was unnecessary and the firm\nquote from Estates for the second was deemed unsuitable by them\nbefore we placed an order. The following quote for that work was\napproximately double the first. The committee has approved work of\nthe following areas: Top Floor, Snack Bar Kitchen, FELIX Office and\nthe Lounge. Thanks\u2014as in many years, must go to Dramsoc\nespecially Andy Cave and Bryan Raven for helping out with furniture\nmoving, repairs and general get-up-and-go.\nEarly in 1983 the GLC Fire Inspectors started poking around the\nbuilding, pointing out various wrongs we have committed and what\nwe should do about them. These works, coupled with the major\nrefurbishment promised by Estates in 1986 will give a lot of work for\nHouse Committee to do over the next acca demi c years.\nOne of the bugbears of the DP is the use of rooms by clubs and\nsocieties as they do not clear up, break things and move furniture. We\nhave fined clubs who consist ant ly break the rules but they still insist on\nbeing stupid. This problem will, no doubt, continue but I hope that\nnext year's people will be able to at least get the better of it.\nDefects and accidents\nHaving reported about fifty defects, most of them have been dealt\nwith by the operations group. I also receive all accident reports\nconcerning students. Some of them are highly amusing, some of them\npoint up deficiencies in safety rules and procedures and some prove\nthe sheer stupidity of people. Among the most common are people\nbreaking glass tubes and cutting their wrist or hand. Safety Council\nseem, in their own detached way concerned about this but the\ndepartment concerned do not appear to take safety in this sense (ie\nsmall personal injuries) seriously\u2014or maybe chemists are just cac k handed. (Bog off, Ed)\nUnion Snack Bar\nLast year the outgoing sabbaticals ne go cia ted with College for the\nUnion to take over the running of the Union Building refectory outlet.\nWe advertised for permanent staff and engaged Norman Jardine as\nmanager.\nAfter immense hassles with senior College refectory staff over the\nstate they left the kitchen area in, we managed to get the operation\nworking for the beginning of Christmas term. Since then, owing to\nNorman's total commitment and energy, along with his various\nassistants, the snack bar has proven to be a valuable asset to the\nUnion, both by bringing people into the building and making money\n(so far!).\nThanks must also go to Brian Lloyd Davies for providing the\nfinance necessary to buy the equipment to set the operation up.\nGames Machines\nThis year we have survived two major attempts at break-ins.\nFortunately the security boxes resisted the entry. Thanks must go (as a registered addict) to Eddie, our supplier, for his prompt ser vise and to\nsecurity for preventing students breaking the machines up.\nOne suggestion I would put forward is that the Halls, at least,\nshould combine their forces to prevent duplication of machines and so\nprovide a better service to their residents.\nTelephones\nOver summer College installed a new computerised\ninternal/external exchange. One consequence of this is the reduction\nof instruments in the office from nineteen to nine! Over the year the\nslowness of college to sort out problems from minor malfunctions to\nlarge-scale disasters has been a real pain.\nFresher's Week\nMy main rep on sibi lit y here was fresher's fair which came off\nreasonably well, after various societies had been sorted out, and\npeople castigated for taking subscriptions. Otherwise the clearing out\nafter parties and stopping drunkards smashing up the building\nprovided most of the amusement. The crash pad again operated\nquietly with about forty people passing through during the two weeks\nit was open in the Upper Lounge. The Met Police again carried out\ntheir bicycle post-coding offer with the result that bike thefts are down\nagain\u2014no doubt also because of Geoff Reeves selling good locks at\ncost price.\nRag Week\nAs with Fresher's week my main involvement extended to clearing\nup after parties. Most of the time it was OK but after Carnival, because\nof the mix-up between Guilds and Ents, there was an awful lot to do.\nLuckily the groups who had booked the rooms the following day did\nnot seem to mind as much.\nSelf Defence Course\nChristine Teller last year tried to get this going but, owing to the\nslowness of the Special Constabulary in getting someone assigned to\nthis College. However, with Julia Kerr of WIST and Linda Sweeney of\nsecurity we managed to get a course for twenty people which most of\nthem enjoyed at least. Coupled with this are the rape alarms which we\nissue free to female students. Having so few here I think we should\ncontinue to issue them and to continue the Self Defence Courses in\norder to provide support for the minority group.\nUniversity Grants Committee\nThis is a quango which gives universities the money to carry out\nteaching, researching and to exist. They paid a visit here to 'hear\nproblems which face IC and cannot be solved internally'. I gave a presentation on student grants, housing and travel grants, all of which\ncan be laid at the feet of government policy. The chairman refused all\nhelp, saying only sympathy was available. The rest of the committee\nseem totally un aqua in ted with the problems London University faces\nand cannot seem to understand that a cumulative de fec it of \u00a32,000\nalong with a housing shortage might put someone off coming here to\nstudy. All in all I was not impressed with the amateurish way in which\nthey approached their 'day out' at IC.\nStudent Services Conference/NUS\nDuring the Lent term a document arrived laying out the\nrecommendations of a working party set up by a conference last\nsummer. The recommendations envisaged combining all the various\npurchasing cartels into one National Student Services Organisation\n(NSSO) creating a central admin office along with NUS Services.\nHaving had experience of NUS Services (I received a cheque from\nthe wind-up of NUS Travel last September\u2014they folded in 1976) we\nwere concerned about the viability of the NSSO. The conference\nconfirmed our worst fears. The NUS politicos in various Colleges\npushed through a motion excluding non-NUS cole ges from NSSO\nafter January 1987. The NUS sabbaticals are worried about this as it\nmeans that Scotland will pull out and there is a possibility that Wales\nand London will do so also. We are trying to set up a separate London\nconsortium but at the moment it is all up in the air.\nIC Union Committees\nCouncil\nThe management committee of this Union is supposed to represent all\nthe various sections of the Union. This year it has been noticeable that\nsome people on it (and UFC) are either i) out to get the best for their\nsection at the cost of all other parts, ii)more interested in the next pint\nthan anything else, or iii j blind to all except their own ego.\nCouncil has only functioned this year because of the dedication of\nsome of the officers and the chairman who has managed to keep the\ntrivia down to a minimum.\nUFC\nWhen we eventually got the accounts for 1983-1984 it was realised that\nthe Bookshop had not made enough money to be able to pass on any\nto the Unions. This amounted to a shortfall of \u00a34,000 between ICU\nand the CCUs. Following this the discovery was made that we would\nbe receiving \u00a3228,750 including \u00a36,500 for UAU from College, rather\nthan \u00a3228,750 plus \u00a36,500.\nThis, along with other factors, combined to give us an expected\noverspend this year of \u00a313,500. Accordingly UFC de cie de not to make\nup the CCUs' expectation of their Bookshop income and further\nmoved to extract \u00a31,000 from Pub Board, \u00a31,000 from Equipment\nreserve and a3% cut across Major Sub-Committees. This gave the\nUnion enough money not to go into deficit for the year.\n\n"

    "content": "Union Duplicating Service This consists of the photo-copier and the\ngeste t ner. The old geste t ner, which was a wreck, has been replaced\nat a not inconsiderable cost. There is no reason why this should\ndegenerate into the same state as long as it is looked after, which I strongly recommend. The only problem with the copier is that Canon\ncannot seem to send us any sensible invoices. The service and\nmaintenance is great.\nParking Permits In theory the allocation of parking permits is dead\neasy. Applications are received and most of the permits are allocated,\nthe rest are allocated pending appeals. In practice there are a number\nof problems. The number of applications is about four times greater\nthan the number of permits, the amount of truth on the application\nforms, is minimal in many cases, and finally some people cannot\naccept that they can't have one. I am fed up to the eyeballs with\nhearing sob stories, very few of which I believe, from people who can't park their ' A' and 'B' reg. BMWs and Rovers having driven them all\nthe way from Earls' Court.\nBlue Book, Council and U GM Policy It was my intention at the\nbeginning of the session to get these all up to scratch but I have largely\nfailed to do this, I do hope however, to have made a sufficiently good\nstart at it such that my successor will be able to finish it off without too\nmuch effort. The by-laws are now up to date and internally consistent.\nSeveral changes were made to achieve this but I was disappointed that\nthe change clarifying the relationship of UFC and Council was\nrejected. A tangible product was the formal is ation of a departmental\nrepresentative from the Department of Social and Economic Studies.\nUG MsI sometimes wonder whether ther is any point in them at all. About\ntwo percent of the Union Membership attend and they don't seem\ninterested in questioning the Exec, or the Officers who are supposed to\nbe accountable to them. The most exciting thing that happened to me\nwas being covered in multi-coloured shaving foam.\nCouncil\nDue to the ineffectiveness of UG M's this is where the decisions have\nto be taken and policy formulated. My main observation of this\ncommittee, apart form noting the remarkably high attendance figures,\nis that disproportionate amounts of time are spent discussing\ntrivialities whereas suggestions with large potential implications get\npassed on the nod. Perhaps this is only to be expected when the people\nwho say most have least to say and those who do least are most\nprepared to criticise. I can only express my admiration of the way\nChris Hendy has handled the rabble and allowed the sensible\ndiscussion and decisions to shine through largely unadulterated.\nUnion Committees\nI am secretary to the following. This entails the taking and\nproduction of minutes. I have, via these minutes, indulged in the odd\npersonal comment for which I make no apology, I'm only surprised I managed to limit them to so few. In each case they represented the\nfeeling of the meeting as I judged it to be, none were subsequently\nam mended. Finance Committee\nThis is by far the most arduous due to the accuracy with which the\nbusiness must be recorded. Despite Dave's occassionally era tic chairmanship I feel that the committee has been constructive and has\navoided much of the petty bickering and vindictiveness which has\naffected it in the past. It remains to be seen whether this will continue\nwhile we attempt to solve the problems which we have inherited.\nHouse Committee\nThis, I feel, could have done more through time constraints do\nprevent investigation of major projects. What it has done has always\nbeen well intention ed and in agreement with the committee as a whole.\nInternal Services\nThis has been an almost complete waste of time. I only hope that\nAlan Rose can do better next year.\nExternal Affairs\nAs above but delete Alan Rose and insert Grenville Mauel.\nCatering Committee\nThis committee has been helped no end by the fact that the Manager\nhas performed better than we could possibly have hoped. I think that\nwe have been very lucky in this respect although this is no reason for\ncomp lacan cy. Exec Committee\nAt the beginning of the session a number of disciplinary decisions\nhad to be made but since then very little has had to be done. There\nseemed to be very little point in concerning a formal committee to\nrubber stamp bookings.\nCollege Committees\nI sit on very few of these and from the performance of some of them\nI am glad it is so few.\nGoverning Body Finance and Executive\nThis is the exception to what I have written above. I have said very\nlittle at the meetings of these committees but I feel that by observing\nthe proceedings and by discussions at pre-meetings of myself, Ian and\nDave I have justified my election as union representative.\nParking and Traffic\nThis committee is absolutely hysterical, the amount of discussion\non hypothetical situations has to be heard to be believed. I feel sorry\nfor Ieuan Thomas who chairs the committee as I feel he is a well\nintention ed blok e but the same cannot be said of some of my fellow\ncommittee members.\nRefectory Committee\nSimon Perry tries hard, Mooney is evasive and usually downright\nobstinate and I sometimes wonder whether there is any point. The\nsooner Mooney goes the better.\nSuggestions and Complaints\nThis is a sub-committee of Refectory Committee. It seems that\nremarkably few people bother to suggest or complain these days,\nMooney pays lip-service in the form of written reply's to those that do.\nHe did, however manage to distort one decision that was made and\nsuccessfully upset the Union Bar staff in the process.\nGU C Are we really that different from other students? Are other de leg tes really representative of their students? Are We? I think it boils down to\nwhat one's conception of what the function of a students' union is. I see nothing wrong in expressing an opinion on apartheid in South\nAfrica (in case anybody gets me wrong here I am very much against it)\nor the NUM strike but I think when it overshadows discussions on\nteaching standard or student residence there is something very wrong.\nI rest my case.\nUGC visitation\nI was not hugely involved in this apart from at the general\ndiscussion level, I was, however, one of the Union delegation and\nworked very hard during the informal conversations with the UGC members over lunch. I was not over impressed with them as a body of\nindividuals and did not think that the way that they shut us out with\ntheir time wasting tactics gave them much credit. I had thought that\nthey were on a fact finding mission but felt that we were treated in a rather patronising manner, they obviously have very little conception\nof what being a modern-day student is like which is hardly surprising\nconsidering what little effort they made to find out.\nIncost\nWe now come to the topic which hs as carried me the largest amount\nof diss appointment this year. Having agreed to accept nominal\nresponsibility for the organisation of this event I was rather pissed off\nto say the least the lack of support from the people who had been so\nenthusiastic that the event should take place in the first place.\nWith the help of those few people interested, Jeremy Green deserves\na mention here, I pressed on and secured a number of speakers and\noffers of visit. Having done this it was then that, in the light of the\nminimal response from the intended participants, we decided to scrap\nthe event. Since then we have had to contend with a number of Dutch\nn utters and Scandinavian loonies who seem to be a pissed off with\nus\u2014the feeling is mutual. I strongly rec commend that we never\ncontemplate organising the event again, not that they'll let us.\nIn conclusion\nThanks to all those who helped me and no thanks to those who\ndidn't. It has been pleasing to work with fellow sabbaticals who share,\nbroadly speaking, a common set of aims and with whom I get on\nsocially. Enormous amount of thanks to my admin strat ive partners in\ncrime, Jen, Pat and Kathy and to those whose helped in less obvious\nways.\n\n"

    "content": "CLETTERS;\nRag Fete\nDear Sir,\nRe-the Rag Fete 11/5/85\nOn Saturday afternoon I attended the\nCollege Rag Fete and now feel extremely\ndisillusioned as to the way College events are\nalmost entirely 'hack' dominated.\nLet me explain. At about 2.20pm( the Fete\nwas supposed to begin at 2.00pm) the doors\nof the Queen's Tower opened, so I followed a large group of people to the top. Having been\nup at the top for a grand total of about two\nminutes a certain Jackie Peirce arrived at the\ntop and started to order everyone down, no\nplease and certainly no explanations were\ngiven. Let me say that it is a good job that I am a member of College who has learnt to\nput up with the behaviour of a hack, and not\na member of the public whose general\nopinion that 'all students are louts' would\nonly be reinforced by this performance.\nTo top it all, when we arrived at the\nbottom, a 'donation' of 50p was demanded\nbefore we could get out. I do not object to\ngiving to charity, but I do object to being\nordered to do so.\nIt wasn't even as if we'd done anything\nwrong. If the Tower was out of bounds to\n'normal' (non-hack) students then there\nshould have been someone guarding the\ndoor, or it should have been locked.\nI'm most glad that I'm a third year and\nthus will not have to endure this inanely\nchildish behaviour after June, and I certainly\nhave great sympathy for future students of\nthis College who, if my three years are\nanything to go by, will have to put up with an\neven worse 'variety' (drinking or childish\nmucking about) of social events. I'm not at all\nsurprised that College want to cut grants to\nthe Union, which after all is supposed to cater\nfor and represent all the students, not just the\nfew who want to spend every evening\ndrinking free beer instead of getting an\neducation, the purpose of attending college, I thought.\nYours angrily,\nMalcolm Preen\nComputing 3\nDear Sir,\nI write in reply to Malcolm Preen's higly\nobjectionable and derogatory comments. He\nsays that he is 'extremely disillusioned at the\nway College events are 'hack' dominated. He\nhas failed to realise that if there were no\n'hacks' there, there would not be an event to\ngo to at all. Without the organisation of the\n'hacks' there would not have been a Rag Fete\nto go to, and as there were a large number of\nstalls there had perforce to be a large number\nof 'hacks'.\nIn response to his criticism of Jackie\nPeirce, RC SUV P elect, I would like to point\nout that she unfortunately suffers from\nvertigo and was severely affected by it*at the\ntime. She had to go up as she was running the\nQueen's Tower at the time. The door was not\nleft open through any fault of her own but\ndue to someone who had wandered up earlier\nand had got locked in. Her behaviour to Mr Preen is highly understandable considering\nthe fact that Mr Preen should have known\nthat he had to pay to go up the Queen's Tower, having been here for three years, and\nnot trespassed where he had no right to go.\nYours faithfully,\nCarl Burgess\nIC Rag Chairman\nDear Sir,\nI should just like to make three points\nregarding the events in the Queen's Tower on\nSaturday 11 in reply to Mr Preen.\n1 The Rag Fete is organised purely as a fund\nraising event for charity. I would therefore\nassume that anyone with a modicum of\nintelligence could deduce that an entrance fee\nwould be required to go up the Queen's Tower. As a third year Mr Preen should\nundoubtedly have been aware of this and\nrealised that perhaps he should not just\nwander in.\n2 The Tower is opened up only under strict\nconditions that numbers inside be carefully\ncontrolled, and that people be supervised at\nevery landing. As there were approximately\n100 people already in the tower entirely\nunsupervised the only course of action open\nto me was to clear the building as quickly as\npossible.\n3 Suffering from vertigo, and having already\nbeen up the Tower less than half-an-hour\npreviously, I was, to say the least, not\nparticularly en amour ed with the idea of\nhaving to go up it again. I was however as\npolite as possible, explaining at every landing\nmy reasons for asking everyone to leave. As I was completely ignored by very many people,\nsome of whom carried on up to higher levels,\nit can hardly be surprising that I appeared a little agitated.\nI apologise to anyone who feels I was being\nunduly officious but I believe the above\npoints should clear up any misunderstand-in gs. If however Mr Preen, or anyone else\nthere still feels so terribly a grieved then I am\nsure a refund can be arranged.\nIn closing I should just like to agree with\nMr Preen on one point; I too am most glad he\nis a third year.\nYours faithfully,\nJackie Peirce\nRCSU VP elect\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to Mr Preen's letter, I believe that his comments refer primarily to\nmyself and not to Jackie Peirce. Jackie had\nthe unenviable and totally necessary task of\nclearing the tower before we could start\ncharging people admission. I believe that she\ndid this both proficiently and amicably.\nCertainly it was not made easy for her by the\nattitude of some people present and the fact\nthat, as I witnessed shortly after showing Mr Preen and friends out, she suffers from\nvertigo very badly. Surely this was then an act\nabove and beyond duty.\nIf there is any blame to be placed it is upon\nmyself for deciding to charge a50p 'exit fee'\nfor all those who had not paid to get in. This\nwas an on-the-spot decision made when I realised that there were approximately 100\npeople inside the tower who had not paid for\nentrance. I interpreted this as a lost revenue\nof \u00a350, about one-t welt h of the final income\nfrom the Fete, obviously something we could\ndo without losing. I did not realise that some\npeople had not been to the top and I apologise if my attitude caused any offence.\nIt is a pity that this incident has marred what\nwas otherwise an excellent day.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Ingham\nRag Chairman-Elect\n1 bo**'?

    "content": "The f oll wo ing UFC saw an attempt by us to rectify the anomalous\nposition of the CCUs who are able to carry over spare money from one\nyear to the next. UFC proposed policy which, in an attempt to cut\ntheir reserves asked them to pay for their clubs 5 year plans from their\nown money and for IC Union after 1987-1988 to take into account\ntheir reserves when UFC decided how much money to give them in the\nfollowing year.\nThis was passed by UFC and the following Council, but overturned\nat a stormy Silwood Council during February.\nAs the sections' estimates started to come in it became clear that we\nwere going to be asking College for a large increase, especially in the\nlight of various Government announcements. Myself and the\nPresident talked to the Financial Secretary about our claim but the\nlatest rumours seem to indicate that we will have a very harsh time\nindeed next year.\nUFC has taken no action to investigate how this Union could ease\nits problems, either by cuts which will not hurt clubs or the central\norganisation or how to increase our non-College sub vent ion income.\nThe members are quite happy to try and defend their own section\nagainst cuts without questioning why these cuts are being asked for by\nthe sabbaticals. If this Union is to survive as a body providing\nsub sidi sed activites for students, UFC or Council (as the management\ncommittee) must address itself to the question of getting money, not\nmerely distributing it.\nInternal Services\nThe actions and prestige of this committee shows what happens when\nyou put politicians in charge of something, ie a lot of words, but\nabsolutely no action at all until one threatens them. I hope Alan Rose\ncan rescue this once-useful committee.\nTransport\nThe running of the system was transferred to the Hon Sec at the\nbeginning of the year. The 'priority users' system was destroyed and\noutside vans taken on. This has resulted in a huge increase in the usage\nof our vans with considerable problems and benefits. Eric and Kathy\nhave dealt with the users competently, although some clubs do not\nappreciate that the vans are there for all and not just themselves. Steve\nLane, as Transport Officer, has kept the vans in working order and to\nall these three must go thanks for a vital part of many clubs\noperations.\nThe Cleaners\nThe cleaners are just about the only people who prevent the building\nfrom vanishing under a pile of dirty plates, cans, glasses and puke\nevery week. Without them I would have despaired at the state of the\nbuilding each morning.\nIC Ents\nDave Allen and his cronies have done better this year in keeping their\nsabbaticals happy. They have organised the Lounge, gigs, and a carnival without losing too much money. They have been around to\nanswer telephone calls and have cleared up after themselves. The only\nimprovement I can see\u2014if nec t year's crew is as good\u2014is in students'\nattitudes to Ents. They deserve it.\nBar Committee\nThis is a sub-committee to Refectory Committee; it cannot make any\npolicy but can only advise the Refectory Manager, and, via the\nRefcetory Committee and Chairman, the Rector.\nThe bars in this College are a fully commercial organisation. Yet the\nsupport given to them seems entirely amateur. Witness the lack of\ncrisps for two months, the lack of matches in the Union Bar. After last\nyear's fiasco over volume rebates it took the committee five months to\nextract some management account for this year's trading which\nshowed some disturbing trends. One possible way around this seeming\nlack of interest from the senior refectory staff is to put the bar\nmanagers on the committee so that they can fully see what is planned\nand how they can help their operations.\nAfter the student services conference qv in which the NUS muscled\nin on cheap goods and services for student unions, the managers have\nbeen negotiating with the brewery reps to di soc ver what discount we\ncan command on our own. The results appear to be quite comforting\nat the moment but no result will become clear until 1987.\nThe Deputy President's report continues on page 15\nHonorary Secretary\nI may as well admit to having written this part of my report last. I didn't realise there would be so much of it, hopefully it will look less in\ntypeset form. It hopefully contains a fairly comprehensive account of\nwhat I have done although I can't possibly account for many of the\nmore menial tasks, to-ing and fro-ing from central stores for instance,\nit is disconcerting to note how much time these take up. I have\nincluded a fair few personal opinions and frank comments\u2014I hope\nthey will not be taken out of context.\nInsurance\nThe task of upkeep of the Union's insurance policies is a major task\nand falls into three cat ago ries, the admins it ration of the Halls, Houses\nand Head tenancies policy which is not terribly onerous, and the\norganisation of both the Union equipment policies and the motor\npolicy.\nAt the beginning of the session it was decided to change the\nresidence policy from being one which covered theft and malicious\ndamage to one that is an 'all risk' policy ie covers loss and accidental\ndamage as well. This nec ces it a ted an increase in premium from \u00a35 per\nyear to \u00a39.50 per year but all those with whom I consulted were in\nagreement that it was a good move. The administration of this policy\ninvolves supplying claim from and ensuring that they are adequately\ncompleted before they are forwarded to the insurers\u2014I have received\nno complaints.\nThe Union holds one large policy for the insurance of its equipment\nand several smaller ones. The main one covers all clubs and societies\nequipment which is kept in or around the building and also when it\nanywhere in the British Isles. The main problem is that societies do not\nlet you know what they own and therefore it cannot be insured. This, I bele ive, has been a problem for many years and is unlikely to improve.\nMost claims have been successful despite several long confrontations\nwith Commercial Union to settle some of them. Despite any problems\nwith Commercial Union I have found them in general to be very good\nand as a consequence, with a UGM's approval, signed a three year\nagreement with them which ties us to them for that period but also\nkeeps the premium at the current level.\nCanoe, Board-sailing and sailing club's equipment is insured on a pleasure craft policy which also insures them on the water, there has\nonly been one claim and no problems.\nOther policies held by the Union although not centrally\nadministered are the flight policies of Balloon Club and Gliding Club\nand that of Underwater club. The latter is of very little interest but it\ndisturbed me to find that the others cost \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,000\nrespectively in premiums.\nThe motor policy has been very little work this year as there have\nbeen very few accidents, the claims on these have all been settled to my\nsatisfaction. We have also used our policy to cover all external van\nhire, this has, in general, only involved one phone call a week and is\nmuch cheaper than using the hire companies individual insurances.\nTransport\nThe responsibility for the transport was transferred from the D Pto\nthe Hon Sec when we acquired the Snack Bar. It represents a major\nincrease in workload.\nThe increase in usage of our own vehicles has increased a great deal\nover the past year. This I believe is due to the removal of priority clubs,\nthe restructuring of transport committee and an increase level of\nawareness of its availability. This has caused a strain on vehicles and\non me. The problem of the former has been eased greatly by a most\nconscientious and hard-working transport officer whose efforts I sincerely hope do not go without recognition. The latter is caused by\nhaving to a quire, from other sources, vehicles to satisfy the demand.\nThe two companies with whom we have discount agreements have not\nbeen able to satisfy the demand so I have often had to go elsewhere.\nThis has not always been as satisfactory as it might have been, but has\nbeen adequate. During the course of this year one vehicle has been\nsold and replaced, this leaves us with two thirteen-seaters and two\nseventeen-seaters, one with removable seats, which I think is a good\ncombination to have.\n\n"

    "content": "Academic Affairs\nIntroduction\nAlthough I 've had an enjoyable and challenging year as A AO it is\ndifficult to construct an annual report. First, there is the question of\nwho to aim it at, the average, apathetic, blinkered student, or the\ninterested few that seriously attend UG Ms. Secondly, what do I pick\nout to write about, after all, it took me, like most of the officers, six\nmonths to get going in the job.\nFinance\nAcademic Affairs is one of the few areas in the Union that does not\nfeel the economic squeeze directly\u2014it gets no budget. Instead, the\nA AO relies on human resources to get things done. Thankfully, this\nyear I have had excellent help from my three C CU AAOs, namely Jane\nRyder, Luke Walker and Tim Williams. With them, and Ian Bull I feel\nthat we have coped well at College committee level. It's not always a question of winning or losing, College often accept our criticisms, if\nour arguments are sensible and well argued, and if we have the backing\nof students in what we press for. I would also like to thank my bunch\nof dep reps I believe those who gave most benefitted most!\nHow to get a first\nUndoubtedly, the University Grants Commission visit to IC was\none of the most important points of the year. The UGC have told the\nCollege that it is not taking teaching seriously enough. Now is the time\nwhen we can make our presence felt, to make sure that there is change.\nBetter lecturing will cost students just a little awareness thought, and\nthe time to fill in course question aires \u2014in return the benefits could be\ntremendous. Please take time to hassle your dep rep\u2014that provides\nvaluable feedback which he/she can use at Council, and which my\nsuccessor can fire at College.\nSir Keith Joseph\nEducation is (foolishly) being butchered. Imperial has to cope with\nthe imposed cuts. This year we have managed to keep the impact on\nstudents, at the academic level, small. College will soon have to\nconsider losing a whole department, rather than just joint honours\ncourses. You can all help. Write to your MP about student grants and\neducation cuts in general. Stop this barbarism.\nGraham for President\nI consider Acadmic Affairs to be of underestimated importance to\nthe 'typical' students. It is a field of Union activities that is open to\neveryone whether you play rugby, drink quarts of ale, and screw\naround, or not. I wish J Martin Taylor and Carl all the best for next\nyear. With your help I hope they can build on the foundations I think\nwe have dug this year. I apologise for not having done more, and I hope I have not let down anybody who helped me. In the six weeks to\ngo, there is still lots to be done.\nMeanwhile, good luck in your exams, and whilst you're in them,\nconsider who you would turn to if you felt there was bias, or if there\nwas a pneumatic drill ringing out persistently, or...\nGraham Thorpe AAO\nPublications Board\nThis year has been very successful for Imperial College's publications. Few (if any) universities and colleges can claim the range\nand quality of publications that IC possess.\nFELIX Dave Rowe's performance this year as FELIX edit i or has been\nimpressive despite many problems he has had to deal with (not least of\nwhich has been his health). As a result FELIX has managed to remain\none of the best student newspapers in Britain.\nIC Radio now broadcast for well over seventy hours. They have more\nlisteners than ever before and their membership in excess of one\nhundred. Inspite of their relatively low budget, they are undoubtedly\namong the most successful student radio stations.\nStoic has been damaged by internal squabbling over the last few years.\nFortunately this year this hasn't happened as a result Stoic\nmembership has grown. Unfortunately the talk of heavy cuts in Stoic's funding has un doubt ably damaged Stoic's moral. Stoic have potential\nso the Union should invest money in it.\nPhoenix This year's addition is as usual packed with interesting and\nentertaining articles and photographs (copies available from all\nmembers of Publications Board, FELIX office, bookshop etc).\nSpecial mention should be made of the superb review of the Phoenix in\nthe Spectator.\nPG Handbook: This is a new publication that has proved to be very\nsuccessful. Early feedback suggests potential PG students have found\nthe publication a useful aid to deciding whether to become aPG. AP and Handbook: The production quality of both of these\npublications is as high as every. Both editors have revised the written\ncontent greatly so that these publications provide as good a guide as\nalways to student life.\nSo far this report has made out that everything is excel lant for\npublications. It isn't!A perennial problem associated with\npublications is the relations between members of various publications.\nThis year FELIX and IC Radio have had better relations than ever\nbefore. However there is still friction between STOIC and the the\nother publications. I am not sure how this can be prevented. I guess the\nindividuals concerned will just have to learn to get on with each other.\nThe second problem is finance. If the Union imposes a cut of, 10%\n(as has been suggested) on the Board, a publication will almost\ncertainly close.\nOn a personal note I would like to thank everyone who has helped\nPub Board and made this year so enjoyable. I would also like to thank\nDr Steve Cook, Peter Hands, Dave Rowe, Peter Coleman, Martin\nBolding, J Martin Taylor, Diane Love, Hugh Stiles, John Jones, Chris\nMartin, Grenville Manuel and anyone else I 've forgotten.\nHugh Southey\nExternal Affairs\nIt is usual at this time of the year for an officer to try and delude\nhim/herself and others into thinking he/she has done a wonderful job.\nI make no such claims, but I do have some points which have come up\nover the year which I believe should have attention drawn to.\nWhen I came into office last July one of the first things I had to\ncontend with were the plans by Sir Keith Joseph to axe the minimum\ngrant. The letter campaign which was instigated proved fairly popular\nwith over a hundred letters being sent. I was far more despondent\nabout the turn-up for the Grants March. (Only 20 people, most of\nwhom, were Union hacks). Before seeing the media coverage\nfollowing the March I was quite disheartened by the apathetic\nturnout. However, since both BBC News and ITV could do little other\nthan present the student protest in juxtaposition to the riots in the\nMinesworkers Dispute I now seriously question the value of such mass\nmeetings. The NUS failed to organise it sensibly and things got out of\ncontrol. I recommend that IC would be better off not attending such\nevents in light of the damage to Students' very creditable position\nwhich media coverage does in the eyes of most tax-payers.\nIt seems to me that with the present Government's resolution to\nconcentrate social benefit to those who most need it that students must\nstrive to make their plight known. I encourage as many students as\npossible to write to their MPs putting forward their points. I would\nlike to see another letter writing campaign put into action by the\nUnion.\nFinally, the relationship with UL U this year has declined to a new\nlow, while we are not affiliated to NUS and we continue to be be\n'billed' as a 'Centre of Excellence' I do not believe that the prejudice\nagainst IC by UL U and other colleges within the University will be\nlightened. To a large extent, IC can continue to promote the insular\n'University of South Kensington' attitude, but I think that IC must\nrecognise that some benefits (such as increased buying power) can be\ngained from keeping in touch. I believe that a diplomatic stance at\nGU C should be attempted.\nI should like to thank the permanent staff in the Union for their help\nover the past year, and I wish Grenville Manuel every success for next\nyear.\nJo Claydon\nEAO\n\n"

    "content": "Rag\nThe year started off very badly with the failure of James Benbow the\nRag Chairman elect, and the fact that a Rag Committee had not been\nelected for this year. Coupled with this was the non-existence of a Rag\nMag for the Year '84-85 after the first and only time an editor had been\npaid to produce a Rag Mag. Efforts were made to recover the money,\nbut to no avail as Dave Larrington was no longer a student (but will be\nagain next year), and as such was not under the jurisdiction of ICU. Tiddlywinks raised \u00a32,100 without any trouble from the Police,\nUnfortunately Eros had been removed from Picadilly Circus and so\nRing-a Roses was moved to the Duke of Wellington Memorial down\nthe road. Many thanks to Mencap for allowing us the use of their\nlicense.\nRag Week raised about \u00a33,000 My thanks to: Gareth Fish for an\nexcellent Beer Festival raising \u00a31,000, Jackie, Dai, Dave, Ian etc for\nthe Smoking Concert, Dave Peirce for the Mines Revue, SCAB for\nSCAB Night, Roger Pownell for Cocktails and to anybody else who\nhelped organise anything.\nRag Tour it was decided that coach trips to sell Rag Mags were not cost\neffective. The difficulties were that to get to any University we would\nhave to leave early in the morning, we had to charge people to go\n(leading to lack of incentive) and had to sell a lot of Rag Mags just to\nbreak even.\nOn the other hand the Rag Tours occured over a long weekend and\nraised over \u00a32,000, and that was selling old Rag Mags. I hope they\ncontinue next year.\nRag Fete raised about \u00a3700 even though the weather was not very\npermitting. Lord Flowers unfortunately could not appear but Lady\nMary came to open the Fete. This year I thought I'd make the Fete\nmore spectator orientated, hence the mud-wrestling which was so\npopular nobody did anything else. This was a bit of an experiment and\nit had some very unanticipated side effects such as Rent-a Hug and the\ncovering of everything in clay. I must thank everybody who turned up\nto help, especially Maribel who made the day a memorable occasion.\nA special mention must be made to RCS who have raised most of\nour total this year, due to the strength of the Carnival Committee and\nto Sean Davis. I hope Jackie Pierce continues this trend. Guilds have\nrecently set up a Rag Committee due to the apathy of the VP to Rag\nand hopefully this situation will change next year. Best of luck to\nSymon Corns. Mines have not done a lot this year but Chris Griffin\nassures me that we'll see a lot more of Mines next year.\nIn total we have raised just under \u00a3 10,000 but I don't have the exact\nfigure. I hope we can do better next year.\nC Burgess\nSCAB\nThe past year has seen the level of activity of The Board's societies\nmaintained, albeit with adaptations in view of the financial pressure\nupon them, and some organisational changes to ensure a more\ncoherent structure which is able to cope with the financial strains\nwhich reduced financing will place upon it.\nThe Chamber Music Society has has a quiet year with a lack of\npublic performances. The demand for both the practise and\nperformance of music by smaller groups definitely exists, but this\ndemand has yet to be met. Furthermore, the precise role of the society\nand its relationship with the other musical groups is unclear. It is to be\nhoped that next year's committee gives these matters the concern they\ndeserve and ensures an increase in the society's activity. The Debating\nSociety, whilst having attracted less famous speakers, has increased\nthe range and nature of the topics discussed and significantly\nincreased its membership. Subjects ranging from the development of\nnuclear power, proportional representation and the existence of\nFather Christmas have attracted variable sized audiences illustrating\nthe desire of students to express their opinions on both serious and\nlight-hearted matters. The Dramatic Society has continued the trend\nof having productions spread through the Autumn and Spring terms,\nall of which received good or average attendances. The 1984\nEdinburgh Tour overcame a series of difficulties to become the largest\ntour so far with up to forty people taking part. The theatre venue,\nwhich the society runs for the duration of the festival, requires\nconsid r able or gnis ation but enables the society's own production to\nbe performed at peak times.\nJazz Club was reformed this year and has begun to find its feet.\nRegular jamming sessions have commenced and, although there have\nbeen no Jazz Club per f om ances as such, a number of bands using the\nclub's facilities have played at SCAB night, Southside and The\nLounge. The Music Society, consisting of the Choir and the Orchestra,\nwith a membership of 280, has had a successful year. The Orchestra's Christmas concert saw a difficult piece performed well and the Choir\nchose a work by Rachmaninov, un performed in Britain for over forty\nyear for their Spring performance. That such difficult works were so\nwell performed is indicative of the increasing ability of musically-inclined students at College. The Operatic Society performed Gilbert\nand Sullivan's The Grand Duke in February, and despite the work\nbeing one of their less well known operas, it received the now\ntraditional full houses and appreciative audiences. Also, Opsoc\nincreased the number of smaller shows performed however the year\nhas been a difficult one with inexperienced committee members\nhandling the problems they faced ineptly.\nNearly all SCAB societies took part in SCAB night, during Rag\nWeek, and although the performance of all concerned were good the\nevening was not as well attended as previous years. It is essential that\nall societies appreciate that this event is for their benefit, to publicise\ntheir activities and requires their encouragement to ensure a good\nattendance and an enjoyable evening.\nThe SCAB Executive took over the booking of the projectors and\nthe system appears to be working reasonable y well. Repairs to the\nSCAB PA system has ensured its continued, heavy use by both Jazz\nclub and IC Ents, with whom co-operation has been excellent\u2014far\nbetter than the previous year.\nThe auditing of the 1983/4 SCAB accounts was incorrect, the result\nof easily avoidable errors by Finance Section. In future, the SCAB\nChairman is to have the full working papers of the audit which should\nensure that any further difficulties are more speedily resolved. Since\nthe format of the SCAB accounts was changed at the request of the\ninternal auditor to meet his specific requirement, I remain bemused as\nto how the mistakes occured. After an inti al request from Finance\nSection concerning the Music Society account, lengthy consultations\nhave led to the Choir and Orchestra's Finances being held by separate\naccounts I remain convinced that this change will be beneficial to both\nparts of Music Society.\nThis year has been a difficult one financially and next year is likely\nto see further problems. In these circumstances, it is essential that\njunior treasurers keep tight control over budgets and organise\nthemselves well\u2014to ensure that the senior treasurers time is not\nwasted. With societies relying more and more on ticket sales as a source of income, the role of junior treasurers is crucial\u2014the financial\nwell being of The Board as as a whole lies essentially in their hands.\nSCAB's contingency is small, relative to both its grant and turnover.\nFinally, I would like to thank all the members of The Board for their\ntime and help over the past year with special thanks due to Nikki Scott\nfor her work on the SCAB Executive and Dr Bill Wakeham for his\ncontinued, excellent work as senior treasurer despite ever-increasing\ndepartmental commit t ment.

    "content": "measures were proposed which, although not popular, were res on ably fair. Yet again, that most widely used of hypocritical expressions,\n'integral but autonomous' was bandied about coupled with some\nhighly selfish and irresponsible behaviour, resulting in the problem\nonly being half solved.\nAdmittedly, attitudes seem to have become more resolute as the\nyear has progressed. However, deep-rooted problems and unfair\npractices still remain and must be solved fairly, very soon.\nMajor Sub-Committees\nOnce again, it is pleasing to be able to report that the MSCs have\nworked well and remained very active, providing all manner of clubs\nand societies (as well as those provided by the C CU clubs and\nsocieties) I was pleased to have been able to attend the majority of\ntheir meetings in a supportive rather than regulatory role. It never\nceases to amaze me how much voluntary work is put in by their\nexecutives, particularly Chairmen, and of course by Senior\nTreasurers.\nWhilst it would be nice to list all their achievements this year, I think\nthat the annual report of each MSC is a much more fitting place.\nACC\nAlthough last session was the inaugural year in U AU, this session\nwas the first in which all clubs were eligible to enter.\nLast year was extremely successful, with five national\nchampionships, and set a very high standard from which to improve\nupon this year.\nTo date, the level of success has unfortunately not lived up to last\nyear's although a number of clubs, including Volleyball, Cricket and\nTennis have reached the elimination round for the national finals.\nMost importantly, more students have taken part this year and\nseem to have enjoyed these new opportunities.\nOn the 'domestic front', club performances seem to be of the same\nexcellent standard as previously.\nRCC\nThe baffling array of non-retrospective consumable\nsupplement aries seems to have been mastered by the RC C clubs who\nhave remained as active as ever and have been well supported.\nIn his second year as Chairman, Hugh Stiles has provided\nexperience and continuity that has been reflected in the smoothness of\noperation of RC C. SCAB\nAs usual, the societies in SCAB have excelled themselves in their\nvarious productions and debates which seem to have been well\nsupported by students and societies.\nAt long last, Nick Shackley's efforts seem to have paid off in the\nreorganisation of Music Society funding and accounts. His re-election\nas SCAB Chairman should ensure that the decision sticks and is\nsmoothly implemented.\nSCC\nOnce the trial and tribulations of Ultra Vires were sorted out, the\nreligious and political societies have continued to cater well for their\nown particular interest groups. The administrative title of\nmiscellaneous societies does not really do justice to the societies in this\ncategory who provide an excellent service.\nOSC\nThe national societies seemed to have catered for many different\nand varied cultures and tastes, to a greater or lesser extent this year.\nDoris Retsina has put much work into OSC and representing\noverseas student interests to the UGC and to College.\nPub Board\nFELIX, the newspaper of Imperial College Union, has been\nconsiderably different to last year under the able editorial hand of\nDave Rowe, and has surprised many people by printing factually\ncorrect, credible news items as well as a number of witty parodies.\nAs for the other written publications, the Handbook was very well\nreceived, the Phoenix has, by all accounts maintained a very high\nstandard and the Alternative Prospectus is currently close to\ncompletion.\nSTOIC and IC Radio have continued to tant a lise the eyes and ears\nof at least some of the Halls, Houses and the J CR whilst the\nenthusiasm of the programme makers remains unabated.\nPost Graduate Affairs\nAfter much hard work by Chris Hendy and the PG Committee, the\nyear got off to a flying start with a very successful party in the Holland\nClub during Freshers Week. Support for PG events as a whole seemed\nto decline somewhat thereafter, though departmental events look\ncertain to be popular.\nOn the academic side, the Rector and Board of Studies agreed to\nincrease the student representation to include the PG Chairman.\nThis year also saw the introduction of the 'PG Handbook' designed\nto help potential postgraduate students at IC to choose aPG course.\nThanks to Hugh Stiles must be recorded for the huge amount of time\nand effort that he put into the handbook.\nExternal Affairs\nThis year, External Affairs have had a lower profile than last year,\nthe main activity centering around the Grants campaign in November,\nand GU C. Ents\nThis year must have been one of the best ever for entertainments,\nwith all credit to the Ents team which, to my mind, has worked very\nwell as a team. They have even managed to break even on the year\nwhich is very good going. On behalf of the Ents team, I hope that you\nhave enjoyed the Carnivals, discos and parties that they have put on. It\nwas certainly a pleasure to help them when requested.\nAcademic Affairs\nThis whole field has been very active this year, with the four A A Os and the dep reps putting in a lot of time and effort.\nThe usual perennial problems of teaching standards, lecturer-training, anonymity of exam scripts etc have been attacked, with\nvarying degrees of success (or lack of it). It seems to me that if the\nCollege is not interested in improving or safeguarding these areas,\nthen perhaps we ought to start public ising these facts in the\nAlternative Prospectus, THES etc so that prospective students at least\nknow what to expect!\nI do sym pathis e with the A A Os who could be in the position of\ncriticising a department or member of staff on, perhaps, one of the\nabove, and yet being examined by that same department.\nHouse Committee\nThis committee has the important but difficult job of maintaining\nthe Union building, a bit like painting the Forth Bridge really.\nEqually never-ending is the acquisition and maintenance of\nfurniture, which migrates around the building at an astonishing rate.\nIf only people would leave the furniture in the room that they found it\nin, everyone would be a lot happier especially the sabbaticals.\nInternal Services Committee\nFollowing a reasonably active and useful committee last year, this\nyear's committee has been a waste of time. The chairman obviously\nstood for the corresponding place on Council, and managed to do\napproximately nothing for the bulk of the year. In fact, this might as\nwell have been the 'Contemplate Thy Navel' Committee for all that it\ndid.\nSuddenly when J MT and ISC was criticised, in public at aUG M, the oft promised but non-existent noticeboard survey miraculously\nappeared, accompanied by a set of ridiculously impractical and\nunrealistic proposals.\nI hope that as Academic Affairs Officer for 1985-1986 he does more\nin this important job than he has achieved this year, and that Rose can\nsalvage something from the mess that he has inherited.\nCollege Committees\nGoverning Body, Finance and Executive Committees\nThese are the top two College committees, each meeting one per\nterm, and there are three student observers on each of the committees.\nAs in previous years, we have had opportunities to voice opinions on a number of issues, and in some cases to force the issue.\nThese meetings are exceptionally valuable to the student\nrepresentatives since much of internal College business is discussed,\noften producing immediate action.\nCollege House' Committee\nA small committee including representatives of Residence,\nRefectories, Estates and Conference. It can often be a short cut to\ngetting things done when lower-level committees can't or won't respond to continual complaints and criticisms.\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nAnnual Report\n1984-1985\npresented to the AGM Tuesday 21 May 1985\nPresident\nIntroduction\nOnce again it is time to put pen to paper and present my report after\nalmost 12 months as President. Such an annual report is inevitably an\nassessment of the many and varied aspects of IC Union that the\nPresident is involved with during the year, as well as comment on\nrelevant issues of the year.\nFor the second year running, we have started and finished the year\nwith the full complement of sabbaticals and more notably, finished\nwith all four sabbaticals on good terms with each other. This has\nresulted in a friendly, working atmosphere in the Union Office as well\nas the FELIX Office, which can only lead to a more effective Union.\nThe Union and its committees\nUnion General Meetings\nTo date, each and every U GM has been closed, even though not\nquo rate, after all business has been dealt with, which to my mind has\nbeen immensely pleasing. This has allowed the sabbaticals and other\nofficers to present their reports and to be questioned thereupon. In\naddition, a number of motions have been heard, the vast majority\nbeing of direct interest to students at IC. Unfortunately, we have as\nyet, not solved the Union's financial problems courtesy of Mirror\nBingo!\nThe attendance has not been particularly high which may be due to\npublicity, lack of interest or any other number of reasons.\nNonetheless, the role of the U GM still remains as important as ever in\nbeing the sovereign body of the Union.\nCouncil\nAttendance has been good this year including the meeting at\nSilwood, and there have often been lengthy discussions and debates.\nUnfortunately, certain members of Council seem unable to see past\nthe end of their nose and would rather spend hours arguing over trivial\nand insignificant points than over policy making issues that could\naffect rather more students than themselves.\nIn particular, the sabbatical Officers reports have tended to be on\nthe long side, simply because it was felt that reports ought to cover as\nmuch of the work being done as possible. What has proven to be\nparticularly annoying is that important issues are glossed over to\nresult in a disproportionately long discussion over relatively minor\nt riva. The Executive\nApart from the mundane tasks of room bookings and parking\npermits, (tasks which have none the less been performed competently\nby the Exec) the other constitutional requirements of the Executive, ie\ndiscipline and policy/decision making where urgency requires action,\nhave fortunately taken up little time.\nThe first two terms saw frequent and regular meetings of the\nExecutive and with, happily only a handful of disciplinary cases, two\nof which went to appeal and were upheld.\nThe Summer term involves considerable extra work for the three\nVice Presidents, Ann, Maribel and Mike, whom I must thank for the\ntime and effort that they have put in. As a consequence, the Exec has\nnot officially met this term, since the only business has been room\nbookings (a task capably carried out by the Sabbaticals).\nUnion Finance Committee\nThis year commenced with putting the final touches to the estimates\n, and trying to incorporate a deficit in excess of \u00a36.500, Various\n\n"
