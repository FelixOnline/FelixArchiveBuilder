    "content": "A Knight To\nRemember\nDon Quixote A play by Keith Dewhurst\nfrom the novel by Cervantes. Directed by\nBill Bryden, The Olivier, National\nTheatre.\nIf a great play cannot be produced from a great novel, as is often claimed, then one is at\nleast entitled to expect a good play from such a book. The production of Don Quixote at the\nNational is such a play. The director Keith\nDewhurst deserves full credit for his courage\nand daring. Not only is Cervantes' book\ngenerally recognised as one of the world's great literary masterpieces (many have gone\nso far as to say that it is the world's greatest\nnovel), but one would have expected that its\nsheer size (over one thousand pages of small\nprint in the Penguin Classics edition) would\nhave prohibited any attempt at its distillation\ninto a two and a half hour production.\nIn all, twenty-six scenes are taken from this\nimmortal and universal book, chronicling the\nadventures of Don Quixote, a splendidly\nheroic figure but much given to spectacular\nand unbridled fantasy, and his faithful\ncompanion, Sancho Panza. The play contains\nsome of the more well-known and amusing\nencounters of the Knight, including \"the most\nterrifying and never-to-be-imagined adventure\nof the windmills\" in which Don Quixote mistakes the sails as limbs of giants, the inn\nwhich he mistakes for a castle, the wandering\nsheep he mistakes for attacking armies,\n' Montes in os' Profound Cave' and its\nsupernatural mysteriousness and the 'Merry\nAdventure of the Puppet Man, with the\nMemorable Soothsaying of the Prophesying\nApe'. (Oh what great stuff this all is!)\nIREVIEWSI\nQuick Change\nCorruption\nOur Friends in the North by Peter\nFlannery, Royal Shakespeare Company\nat the Pit, Barbican Centre. Directed by\nJohn Caird.\nOur Friends in the North is a combination of\npolitical thriller and social drama with a central\ntheme of corruption in British public life. The\nplay covers the years 1964 to 1979 and\nfeatures local politics in the northeast, the\nMetropolitan Police in London, and the\nRhodesia at the time of the oil embargo. On first sight, these three subjects seem too\nweighty to be combined in a single play.\nPaul Schofield plays Don Quixote and Tony\nHaygarth Sancho Panza, but Don Quixote's horse, Rozinante, and his companion's mule,\nfaithful Dapple, are ' replaced' in this production by a splendid penny-farthing and a mini tricycle. These delightful constructions\nare the vehicles of their dreams on which they\nsally forth in their quest for adventure. Paul\nScofield's portrayal of Don Quixote as a fanatical Knight Errant in maniacal pursuit of\nknight errant ry is comic but utterly endearing.\nThe Don's extravagant fantasies and romantic\nideas belong to a former, Golden Age, an age\nof 'peace, amity and concord'. No longer in\nexistence, the Order of Knighthood defended\ndamsels, protected widows and assisted\norphans. In the manner of a saint, Don. Quixote undertakes chivalrous adventures in\norder to be worthy of the fair Lady Dulcinea.\nHe much admires this lady whom he considers\nchaste and beautiful, but is in reality none\nother than Aldonza Lorenzo, the fastest salter\nof pig-meat in the locality. In contrast, Sancho\nPanza possesses much more down-to-earth\ncommon sense, but remains paradoxically\nwith his fanciful master because of the promise\nof the governorship of an island in those far off\nlands which the Don imagines conquering.\nAlthough the play has certain faults and\nshortcomings it is nevertheless very amusing\nand has many magical moments (witness a string of sheep on roller-skates). An excellent\nband gives musical and vocal accompaniment:\nsome of them are well-known folk musicians:\nMartin Carthy, Bill Caddick and Maddy Prior.\nIt is the comedy on one side of the coin and the\ndeep, deep sadness of the human condition on\nthe other that is so cleverly and entertain gly portrayed by Cervantes in his book (and after\nall, there is a little bit of Don Quixote in each of\nus). If you haven't read the book, the play at\nthe Olivier Theatre makes a memorable\nintroduction.\nNick Bedding\nGet out of that, Rhodesia! Joseph Marcell\n(black), David Whittaker (white).\nHowever, they are unified politically by the\ncorruption theme and socially by two of the\nleading characters, Nicky (Phillip Walsh) and\nGeordie (David Whittaker) who pass from\nnaivety to dir i!l usi on me<r during the play.\nThese two actors portray a politically 'likely\nlads' story with the form, r staying at home and\npursuing a conventional career in Tyneside\npolitics, whilst the latter is the bad penny who\nleaves and follows a less orthodox path.\nOne of the many joys of this play is the\nHerculean task under tak n by the performers\nof presenting thirty-four characters between\nonly about twenty actors. This calls for\nquick costume and character changes, with,\nfor example, James Garbutt playing a flat-capped working class Geordie, a commissioner\nin the Metropolitan Police and a Rhodesia\nminister.\nThis production does not require an interest\nin politics to be appreciated.\nStudent standby tickets may be obtained for\nthis play which continues through October\nand November.\nNick Hill\n\"No, you can't have a lift!\" Don Quixote (Paul Schofield) shows off on his penny-farthing.\nDank And\nLanky\nHanky Pan ky,a film directed by Sidney Poitier, at the Classic, Chelsea. Having recently gone on general release, the\nlatest \" all action comedy adventure\"( sic)\nfeaturing Gene Wilder as our innocent blue-eyed hero, Hanky Panky will contain few\nsurprises and few laughs to those cog nos centi of the genre.\nDirected once more by Sidney Poitier, this\nfilm makes their previous effort Silver Streak\nappear positively classic. The approach is the\nsame: a woolly plot based around big business\nespionage and murder catching up with our\ninnocent hero, while he pursues carnal rather\nthan financial aims. The plot is deliberately left\nloose as a framework for plenty of farcical\nhumour. \"However, where Silver Streak scored\nwas to have Gene Wilder playing off Richard\nPrior, a superb \u2022 talent in his own right. In\nHanky Panky; this element is missing. His\nfemale co-star (whose name escapes me) has a stronger role than the previous film: she is\nnotable for her adeptness as a motor mechanic as well as a sex-symbol. Indeed, only\novertime work by the make-up department\nmakes her role as object of our hero's desires\ncredible.\nI hope Mr Wilder will move off to more fertile\nground for his next film and that this will mark\nthe low point in the film career of this talented\nperformer. He seemed to thrive under the\ndirection of Mel Brooks( remember The\nProducers and Blazing Saddles) and I hope he.\nmanages one day to recapture that form. So\nunless you are a devotee of undemanding rib-tickle rs,s tear clear of this banal offering.\nLee Paddon\nFELIX IOctober 15, 19821 Po geT l "

    "content": "WALKABOUTLOOHSte\nky Mobile Optics fy c. The Victoria & Albert Museum, at the bottom\nof Exhibition Road, started life as the Museum\nof Manufacturers, with a government grant of\n\u00a35,000 to buy ornamental art from the Great\nExhibition of 185J. Today, the museum houses\na huge collection which ranges from ceramics\nand musical instruments, to tapestries and\nprints.\nThe Jewellery Gallery has been closed since\nNovember 1977, when it was found to be full of\ntoxic blue asbestos! It reopened last week to\nshow its sparkling permanent display, which\nincludes ornaments from the Russian Crown\nJewels, and the famous Canning Jewel, traditionally said to have been given by a Medici prince to a Mughal emperor. This\ntreasure-house of a gallery is also intended to\nhouse occasional small exhibitions of modern\njewellery: the first is an exhibition of work by\nWendy Ramshaw.\nThe jewellery on show results from a collaboration with Wedgewood. She is the first\nartist-jeweller to work with Wedgewood in the\ncompany's222 years. In the catalogue to the\nexhibition she says: \"I wanted to make pieces\nof jewellery which carried some of the vitality\nNeckpiece bearing pink and white Jasper with\nsilver beads.\nof so-called 'primitive' body ornament. I also\nwished to relate to 20th century form and\ntechnology. The collaboration with Wedgewood afforded the chance of using the famous\nBlack Basalt... reputed to have the most\nexcellent turning properties. In the event most\nof the pieces were made with the other famous\nWedge wood clay, Jasper, a dense white\nvitr if i ed stoneware body having much the\nsame properties as porcelain.\"\nHer beads are perfect geometric shapes:\ncones, spheres, hemispheres, and discs, and\nalso, cotton-reel and bobbin shapes. This basic\nvocabulary is arranged in varying degrees of\ncomplexity, sometimes combined with precious metals, semiprecious stones, feathers and enamelling, to form neck pieces, earrings and pins. Each piece seems to be\nmaking a complex symbolic statement, as if,\ngiven sufficient insight or inge u it y we'd be able\nto decipher a message hidden behind the\nsimple beauty of the geometric sequence.\nAmazingly, for modern jewellery, the pieces\nare very wearable. Some of the larger, stiff,\nnecklaces would look best set against a very\nsimple dark dress( as would an ornate necklace of any period) but others, and\ncertainly the pins and earrings, would be just\nas happy with denims!\nHowever, Miss Ramshaw is also concerned\nthat the pieces should be formally resolved\nwhen not being worn and has, at times,\ndevised means by which they can be enjoyed\nout of context of the wearer. For example, she\nhas made several totem pillars or columns of\nturned beads in fine grained stoneware and\nporcelain, in colours ranging from brilliant\nblues and dull purples to pale greens, creams\nand white. They are threaded on spikes and\nrest on a brass disc: each column unscrews to\nallow a random selection of beads to be strung\nas a necklace on a nickel-silver neck wire. Some of the jewellery on show was\nproduced by Wedge wood from Miss Ramshaw's designs, in limited and unlimited\neditions. The exhibition also includes other\nwork, from her ring sets of the late 1960s to\nnew ceramic pieces produced independently\nof Wedgewood.\nAlso at the V&A at the moment, is an\nexhibition of watercolours by John Sell\nCotman, 1978-1842.\nUntil 1750, the watercolour was considered\na fairly minor art and was generally limited to\nGold neck wire with black ornaments\nthe tinted drawings of topographers, and the\n'originals' used by engravers, coloured lightly\nand soberly. The Romantic movement and the\nperfection of the art of watercolour in this\ncountry, coincided at the end of the 18th Century, and made the English watercolour\nschool the most remarkable in the world.\nLandscape could express all Romantic sensitivity, all spiritual moods: it was a limitless\nrealm of poetic freedom. And watercolour,\nwith its clean colour, it swiftness and lightness .\nand its clear, almost transparent, lighting\neffects, provided the landscape artist with a way of expressing himself in a form that was\npart realistic, part poetic.\nJohn Sell Cot mah' s watercolours are\ndelightful. His drawing is superb and he steers\na course on the picturesque side of pretty. He\nsometimes uses touches of pure colour to\npowerful effect and the pictures are light and\nsoft, both in terms of photons-apparently-emitted and in the delicacy of colouring and\ndesign. Highly recommended to gentlefolk of\nvery civilised disposition!\nJohn Sell Cotman 1782-1842 is on till Oct 24\nand Jewellery by Wendy Ramshaw till January\n16, both at the Victoria & Albert Museum,\nopen daily ex c pet Friday; Mon-Sat 10:00-5:00pm; Sun 2:30-5:50pm; both exhibitions are\nfree.\nOSC Raffle\nThe winners of the Grand Raffle in aid of the\nWorld University Scholarship are:\nP Baker of NatWest who wins a Sinclair Z X81 microcomputer.\nT Karagouris, Aerio 2, who wins a book\ntoken worth \u00a320.\nN Buskell Aero PG who wins a Texas TI35\ncalculator.\nA Kotcheff, Kremantze Hotel Room 206,\nwho wins a bottle of.champagne donated by IC\nUnion.\nThe following win a bottle of wine: R May\n( Physics3), Mac Lenna n( Elec Eng1), G Kretsis (Aero PG), N Alipplantis ( DO C2),P Nathan (Biochem 3), K Joseph (Chem Eng), V Gandhi (107 Wakeman Rd), P Fernandez\n( DO C2),R Mendez (44 Werter Rd), L Jorden\n(ME3), I Graham-Watson (Admin), S Stirling\n(Admin), J Harpalani ( DOC1), A Davies\n(Admin) and Dr Perry (Civ Eng).\nThe last prize, a small bottle of port, donated by Mr Mooney goes to Dr Richardson\nof Chem Eng.

To help change this,\nIndia Society is running a short season of films\nthis term f ea:u ring great directors such as\nSatyajit Ray, Minnal Sen and Shyan Benegal.\nAll films are subtitled in English and the season\nstarts on Tuesday in Me ch Eng 220 at 6:00pm with Company Limited.

But\nhe loses something more important \u2014 the respect of his beautiful sister-in-law.\nThis charmingly told tale is a send-up of\nIndia'smock western business crusaders unfolded in the best of cinematic traditions.\nThe British have long left India and the Raj\nexists only as a memory. But the traditions,\nthe exclusive clubs and gym khan as and public\nschools have been left behind to provide a somewhat ill-fitting and pretentious lifestyle for\nthe country' s brown sahibs. The rich Industrialists.\nShy a mal, the bright, personable and smoothly Westernised young man is in the\nrunning for a coveted seat on the board of the\nBritish company he works for. He is stirred to\ntake stock of his life when his sister-in-law\ncomes to Calcutta from a provincial town for a visit. She observes all the aspirations to a Western style of culture with a mixture of\nwonder and irony.\nRay's greatness lies in his treatment of the\nsubject in such a manner that the superficial\nstrangeness of the characters is soon lost and\none immediately recognises situations familiar\nand known in human terms.\nSharmila Tagore gives an exquisite portrait\nof the sister-in-law who combines, so rarely,\nintelligence and humanity. Ray's heroines are\nalways so bright and deep.\n\u2022October 15.19821\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS!\nMiriam Karlin as Mother Sawyer with Andrew Jarvis, Ronan Wilmot, and Graham Turner.\nBook\nThe New and Noble School: The PreRaphaelites by Quentin Bell, Macdonald\n\u00a310.95.\nThe Pre-Raphaelite movement started in\n1848. It was a semi-secret society formed by\nseven artists as a reaction against the artistic\ndoctrines that had prevailed from the time of\nRaphael (early 16th Century) onwards. The\nPre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (as they called\nthemselves) wanted to return to what they saw\nas the more natural, honest and pious approach to the artists who worked before the\nRenaissance. According to Ruskin, the PreRaphaelites champion, art since the sixteenth\ncentury had degenerated into 'indolence,\ninfidelity (because they didn't copy faithfully\nfrom nature), sensuality and shallow pride'.\nThe Brotherhood set out to regenerate British\nart (they adopted a high moral tone and largely\nignored foreigners) by painting historical and\nother scenes as they actually might have\nlooked.\nThis is a very small scale summary of what\nQuentin Bell's book is about. If you have any\ninterest in the subject then this is a good\nbook to buy (if. you can afford it) because it's interestingly and informative ly written, and\nsometimes very entertaining. For example \"...if\nI you could go to Italy and see originals...you\nj probably received an impression far deeper\nand more valuable than that which the art\nlover of today gains from the enormous mass\nof mendacious rubbish, purporting to be\nfaithful reproductions of oil paintings by the old\nmasters, beneath which our coffee tables\ngroan.\" The book does get a little too profound\ntowards the end but on the whole it's very\ngood to read. There are about sixty-six\npictures in it as well.\nNick Willsor\nCat People, Paul Schroder, X, now\nshowing at Plaza and ABC Fulham Rd.\nCat People is billed as a mixture of horror\nand erotic fantasy. It fails as both.\nThe story begins with virginal Irena\n(Natassia Kinski) visiting her long-lost brother\nPaul (Malcolm McDowell). He immediately\nattempts to rape her. Then he spins her a yarn\nabout how incest is good for them. It stops\nthem turning into man-eating big cats, he\nassures her. Straight sex is a no-no.\nThen Irena falls madly in love with the city,\nzoo curator. Soon afterwards he suspects\nIrena of actually being a panther and not a girl\nat all. But he's determined not to let a thing like\nthat spoil an otherwise beautiful relationship.\nThe film has very little to recommend it. The\nfilming is dull and unimaginative (except for a few bits knocked together for publicity purposes) and the screenplay crap (although\nthe score is pretty good). Even the special\neffects, which usually make up for an\notherwise bad film are surprisingly ineffective\nin Cat People.\nHowever, I have a feeling that the film will be\nas tremendously successful as Bo Derek's little\nromps. Natassia Kinski is undeniably beautiful\nand as she spends most of the film pouting\n'innocent' sexuality it is sure to be appreciated\nby those to whom a good film is synonymous\nwith one off the wrist.\nSteve Marshall\nTheatre\nThe Witch of Edmonton by Dekker, Ford\nand Rowley, directed by Barry Kyle,\nRoyal Shakespeare Company at the Pit,\nBarbican Centre.\nThe playwrights have combined their own\nrespective talents of melancholy, satire and\ncomedy to produce a delightful combination in\nThe Witch. Written in 1621, the play was one\nof the few of that period which was concerned\nprimarily with the poor. Miriam Karlin plays\nMother Sawyer, a persecuted pauper who\nexperiences the spirit of the devil, appearing\nbefore her in the form of a black dog\n(portrayed by Miles Anderson). With the help\nof the canine devil, Mother Sawyer seeks her\nrevenge on a community based on lust, money\nand greed. Apparently the story is based on a true one, of Elizabeth Sawyer from Islington\nwho was hanged for witchcraft in 1621.\nThe Pit is the Royal Shakespeare Company's small auditorium at the Barbican Centre, seating only 200 people. It continues the\ntradition of the Other Place (at Stratford) and\nthe Warehouse which were rehearsal spaces\nconverted into intimate theatres. This intimacy\nadded to my enjoyment of the Barry Kyle\nproduction since sitting on the front row I was\nvirtually on the edge of the stage, with props\nand actors flying past my eyes. Indeed this was\na refreshing evening of theatre, a welcome\nbreak from the West End sitcom.\nHowever, due to the size of the Pit and the\npopularity of The Witch, I strongly recommend\nthat ticket availability is checked before setting\noff for the Barbican. Tickets, programmes and\ndrinks are inexpensive at the Pit and the play is\nbeing presented on several dates between now\nand early December.\nNick Hill\nCat and Dog:- Natassia Kinski as Irena in Cat People and Miles Anderson as the dog in The\nWitch of Edmonton.\nPogelO l October15,1982 I FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "Last week both Guildsheet and the HG Wells\nSociety used pictures of the female form to\nattract cheap publicity. The women's group\nWIST, among others, were offended, and this\nweek two of WIST's officers reply, asking\nWhy must you be\nso childish?\nIn reply to last week's article 'WIST Drive Fails' we would like to put a few facts right and expand a little on the motion which was to have been\nput forward at the first U GM. Firstly WIST cannot be described solely\nas a women's rights group, since we aim to provide information about\nsuch varied topics as woman's culture (including film, theatre, music,\netc), her involvement in politics, economics, society. We also try to\nvoice the opinions of women at this otherwise male orientated college.\nwas actually directed.\nThe two main images used in\nthe picture: firstly, the woman\nAt the U GM, WIST was to\nput forward the fact that both\nfemale and male students found\none of the Well Soc post c. used\nin Freshers' Week, offensive.\nMany of these students quer i. the relevance to Well Soc, ot a picture of a woman' snaked breasts, and wondered at whom this unnecessary form of publicity\npurely as an object of lust, and secondly the stereotype ' He man' suggest that WellSoc is\ntrying to attract fresher s who see\nthemselves in this light.\nIs Wellsoc trying to discourage\nwomen from joining? Or, is it\nSusan Walts, WIST spokesperson:\n\"We hope you will support us in\nstopping such irresponsible\nbehaviour.''\ntrying to win an exclusively male\naudience, by appealing directly\nto stereotype male sexual fantasies? This appears contrary\nto their saying in the Union\nHandbook: \" This is the society,\nthe one where everyone's face\nfits, no matter what their interests, creed or colour or political allegiance.\" We also\nunderstand that it is not com mon practise amongst pub l city officers, to use pictures which\nare totally irrelevant to their\nsociety in order to advertise its\nexistance. Another instance of\nthis however, was brought to our\nattention in the first cover of\nGuildsheet. The thoughtless front cover of a semi naked woman was used as a desperate\nattempt by the Guild sheet Editor to attract a new readers hip. We feel that both the\nWellsoc poster and Guildsheet\nfront page give a sadly childish\nimpression of IC students to the\nfresher s, and that the people\nresponsible for it are not helping\nCollege in its aim to attract more\nwomen into all departments.\nWe hope that many of you\nwill come to the next U GM to\ndiscuss the motion on Union Publicity (we need at least 300\npeople just to be able to discuss\nthe motion) and gives us your\nsupport in stopping such irresponsible and thoughtless behaviour.

Thank you to the person applying from Holbein House who\nmade me laugh after all of that!\nSeriously though, those who are lucky enough to be living close\nto College already; in either Westminster Council or Kensington\nand Chelsea Council areas, can apply for a 'Resident's Parking\nPermit' to the appropriate Council. You do not have had to live in\nthe district for a specific time and, I have been informed, the\npermits cost only about \u00a310 a term. The address of the Council\nshould be in the telephone directory.\nTo those who were hoping to offer lifts to female flat mates in\nKensington/Hamlet Gardens, firstly, these areas are relatively well\nlit and residential and therefore safer than most, secondly, if you're\nworried (and I know that sometimes I was very scared walking\nback to Evelyn Gardens at midnight after working late) then there\nshould be Rape 'Alarms' available, free, from the Union Office as\nsoon as they arrive (hopefully they should have at the time you are\nreading this).

    "content": "I! lii\nLetters\ncontinued\nroom high up in the Elec Eng\nbuilding when I unwittingly\nstumbled upon a conspiracy of a very similar sort to the one\nabove. What sounded like three\ndistinct male voices were saying\nbehind closed doors that within\ntwo weeks everything would be\nready, all the inside contacts\nwould have been made, to insert\nquantities of strychnine into\nrandom portions of College\nrefectory food. For fear of my\nown safety, I fled before the\nmeeting was over, and so was\nnot able to hear any more\ndetailed information, or discover\nthe identities of these criminals.\nObviously, sir, this is a very\nserious matter, and I refer it to\nthe proper authorities. Let me\njust make the point, however,\nthat in the USA the parent\ncompany of the Tylenol makers,\nJohnson and Johnson, acted to\nwithdraw its entire stock of these\nanalgesic capsules from the\nmarket soon after the outbreak\nof the poisonings. Perhaps a similar preventive measure\nought to be taken.\nYours sincerely\nMark Komondouros\n(in the interest of my safety, not\nmy real name)\nMaths 3\na Hypocrisy\nA wonderful letter in this week's Broadsheet deserves a wider\naudience; in it, Miss Deborah\nCooper tells how no less a person than Phil Nathan enc our aged her to advertise\nsweatshirts by parading herself\ndressed in nothing but a sweatshirt and underwear( RCS nymph et reveals all?). I am not\noffended by this, although I do\nsee that many people may be;\nbut I do condemn most strongly\nMr Nathan's hypocrisy in doing\nthis and then condemning sexist\nbehaviour at the RCS UG M.UG Ms This is rather old news now, but\nI would still like to congratulate\nNick Pyne on the way he\nhandled the U GMa week ago;\ndespite a few technical slips. He\nmade it clear that his aim was to\nget through the agenda quickly\nand democratically without\nletting wrangling pedants bog\nthe meeting down. What a pity\nso few people were there; could\nit be because at the RCS U GM the previous Monday (which was\npacked) Karl Schmidt chaired\nthe meeting so badly?\nOther Publications\nThere are still several copies of\nthe post grad FELIX, last week's FELIX, some old Phoenixes,\nand the Event London Student\nGuide. Anyone who would like\ncopies can help themselves from\nthe FELIX Office.\nNext Week\nNext week's FELIX will contain\nthe photographs of the people\nwho have the dubious privilege\nof sitting on Union Council;\nphotographs must be handed in\nto Mary Freeman, please, by\nMonday 5:30pm, or I may print\nsomething less complimentary in\ntheir place.\nFELIX Blues\nApologies to those of you who\nhave a calendar in which the\ncolours aren't properly regis t ered. We've had an enormous\namount of trouble with the\ncolour machine, and in addition\nto all the production apparatus\ngoing wrong (which we've grown\nto expect) and our suppliers\nletting us down (ditto) we've\nbeen plagued with little irritations like the telephones being\nout of order, the lights failing in\nthe print room, and (I kid you\nnot) someone walking into the\noffice and stealing artwork that\nwas about to be printed.\nFELIX Staff\nWe still need anybody and\neverybody who can spare the\nodd hour to help, particularly if\nyou are free on Thursday afternoons. About forty people\nsigned up as being 'interested' at\nFreshers' Fair. If you're still\n'interested' in spending some\ntime working on FELIX( how-ever little or irregularly) then\ncome to the staff meeting at\n12:45 today in the FELIX office, at any time except]\nThursday (when it is part of the ]\nEditor's job to panic and be bad-tempered).\nImpossible Without\nNick The xt on, Lee Pad don, Petra Barry, Mark Smith, Tim\nNoyce, Peter Rodgers, Dave\nRowe, Phil Greenstreet, and\nNick Pyne for pasting-up and\ndoing other jobs which are less\nthan exhilarating, Pinocchio and\nWalkabout-Looksee for their\nrespective columns, Dave Parry,\nRamzi Shammas, Steve Bishop\nand Mark Heasman for photographic work, Chris Mallaband\nfor sport, Hugh Southey for\nWhat's On, Adrian James for\nthe news, Hazel Cheesbrough\nfor the only decent contribution\nto the Letters page this week\n(and for giving me the opportunity to show I can spell her\nsurname) and Maz and Peter for\ntypesetting and printing.\nMartin S Taylor\ni \u2022 \u2022 i_t i it i_iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii it ii~i~ i~i~i~ ii~i~ i~i\"\"i~ i\"i~i rr ii~i\"i ri\"i. \u2022 i \u2022 \u2022 iiii iiii \u2022 i \u2022 iii iii iii iii ri~i\"i \"ri~i\"ii i~i \"ri~ir.I III IIi r ii\"i \"ri\"i\"i\" r(\" i~i\"i\" i\"ii iii iii iii\" i~i\"i\" i\"i~i~ i~i_i r||_|_|_|_|_|_,_|_|_|_,_|_,_|_,_|_|_|_,_'_|_,_,_|_|> \u2022 iii iii iiii iii iii iii i.L1111.1.1111i ii1111ii iii iii iri rrr rrr i~i~ rrr ri\" i_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_,_|_|_,_|11t j tj iji~ Cityr^ r cccccc rr cci \u00a3f'i~t~ i''i 'ccc\n- i.|i'i'i i'iii i|ii i''Ci~ i~'\"ri~ rrr i\" rrr i~i~ ri~r rrr i~i~i~ i~i\"i\" the Captain had no comment to\nmake.\nThe rumour turned out to be\nfalse, but that didn't stop the\nCaptain from being in a foul\ntemper for weeks, and cross-examining even his closest\nfriends on whether they had\ndone any writing for what he\ncalls \" that scurrilous news-paper\".\nAT LONG LAST ex-editor\nSteve Marshall has found someone who is prepared to\nemploy him. No more will the\nFELIX staff hear his nasal,\nwhining demand for tea (ac-curate ly mimicked by the rest of\nthe staff). No more the rotund\nlittle figure with the expression\nof childish glee when someone\ntakes pity and buys him a biscuit. No more the withering\ncontempt for anyone who so\nmuch as hints at an interest in a woman's charms (for Steve\nregards sex as a rather good\njoke, and the idea of gaining\npleasure from it is quite strange\nto him). No more half-finished\narticles for the Daily Mirror, no\nmore madcap money-making\nschemes, no more deliberate\noffensiveness to anyone who\ndare stand up to his supreme\narrogance. Steve\u2014we shall miss\nyou greatly, we wish you well\nsub-editing the magazine General\nPractitioner, and we look forward to seeing you back here\nin the evenings.\nNow all we have to do is find a way of getting rid of Mark Smith\nBUT BEFORE I leave Steve\nMarshall alone (for this week, at\nany rate) I feel I should make\nsome mention of his obstinacy,\nand in particular the way in\nwhich, having decided he has a pretty shrewd idea of valuing\nantiques, it is taking the ridicule\nof most of the Union to point\nout his folly.\nHis first purchase was a stuffed antelope head (\u00a320)\nwhich he has donated to FELIX and which stares down disapprovingly as I write. More\nrecently a bamboo flowerpot\nholder has appeared (\u00a3 13) and is\nnow residing in the president's room in Linstead until Steve can\nfind room for it. Personally I think it resembles nothing so\nmuch as one of those fairground\namusements that you throw\ntennis balls into in an attempt to\nwin a goldfish; but Steve seems\nto like it.\nBut the most appalling, the\nmost tasteless, the most unattractive purchase to date is a wrought-iron candlestick in the\nshape of a dragon which Steve\npaid twenty-five pounds for. This\nobject is so ghastly that it has\nmet with the universal detestation of all who have set eyes on\nit, and even Steve himself is\nbeginning to realise that its\ncharms aren't quite what he first\ntook them for. So if anyone has\na use for such an ornament, drop\na note to Steve in the FELIX Office. I'm sure he'd accept any\noffer around \u00a330.\nSteve Going-for-a song Marshall\nwith the latest of his many\ndubious trophies.\nAND FINALLY, two weeks ago\nI received an anonymous letter\nwith a photograph attached\nwhich purported to identify the\nmascot e ers who took Mike over\nthe summer.

These tournaments are\nmostly scratch and handicap so\nyou don't have to be in the team\nto travel the country and maybe\nwin a trophy.\nYou don't have to be good to\njoin the club so it doesn't matter\nif you haven't bowled before\nBowling is great fun so do come\nalong on a Wednesday. For more information contact Chris\nWells via the Che mEng letter-racks.\nLadies\nSport for women does exist at IC and several clubs have specific\nladies sections. Most clubs would welcome your participation\u2014the degree of involvement\nis up to the individual, but there\nis plenty of opportunity whilst at\nCollege to indulge in some athletic activity. Join the club\nfor the sport you are familiar\nwith, or try out something new.\nIf you cannot find the relevant\nperson to approach for details\nof the club you would like to\njoin, then contact me via Life Sci\nletter-racks in Beit.\nPS: Anyone who played netball at school and would like\nto throw a ball around again?\nWe have the offer of a friendly\ngame from Guildford in December so let me know if you would like to play.\nDominique Turner\nHockey\nSeconds . . .\nUnder new management and evidently inspired by the sweat\nfrom the still dirty first team\nshirts the 2nd XI produced a performance boarder in gon the\nalmost competent. N PL obviously overawed by the Eldrige\npre match training session, which left most of the team on their backs, allowed IC to take\ncontrol and in a rapid counter-attack reminiscent of Goose Green, Payne crossed the ball\nallowing Witter to score a well-taken goal.\nAfter half-time IC decided it\nhad been a day's work well done\nand allowed N PL to play as well.\nSome stolid defence ensued but\nafter a series of short corners\nN PL finally managed a shot on target and honesty prevented\nWhitehead from kicking the ball\noff the line twice in the match.\nSo the sun set on the final ten\nminutes of the match with only\nEl dr ige s voice spurring on a team spoiling the serenity of a lovely autumn evening.\nFELIXl \u2022October 15,19821\nand\nLadies\nIn the U LU7a side tournament\non Sunday ICl sts beat Royal Free and Kings by 2-0; drew\nwith Chelsea II and lost 0-1 to\nSt. Georges. Unfortunately we\ndid not qualify for the semi-finals.\nA typical IC poor turn-out\nmeant that we had to borrow a few players from St Georges to\nmake up a second team. 1-0\nlosses were sustained against Royal Free, UCH and Barts but\nwe did manage a00 draw with\nSt Thomas.\nSome of our players have been\ninvited to UL U trials and as\nAlison remarked \" We all deserve a bloody medal for turning\nup at 8:00 on a Sunday any-way!\" Squad: Janey, Melanie, Sara,\nShirley, Alison, Jo, Karen, Clare,\nRuth, Ann, Alison.\nSpecial thanks to both Chris and Pete for umpiring.\nHB HH HH9 HH| Page i3 "

    "content": "Advanced\nContraception\nDear Martin\nAlthough I greatly appreciate\nthe venture of FELIX into the\nWelfare field last week with the\nphotograph of advanced contraceptive equipment, I was disappointed that there were not\nmore descriptive details in the\ncaption to the photo. I would\nlike to correct this by making the\nfollowing facts known through\nyour columns (or in FELIX if\nyou find it too painful).\nFirstly, it must be pointed out\nthat the torch is not an essential\npart of the equipment, but if it is\nto fee included then instructions\nfor use must be followed to the\nletter. These things are best\ndemonstrated so I am offering to\ndemonstrate correct operation\nof a torch if anyone approaches\nme with a current copy of\nFELIX. It was thoughtless of you to\nomit to say that contraception is\nalways improved if both partners\nuse protection. You should therefore have pointed out that you\nwere in fact illustrating only the\nequipment designed for the\nmale. An equivalent is also\navailable for females and is\nstrongly recommended. It\nconsists of India rubber long-johns, perspex Liberty bodice\nand damp galoshes. I do not\nhowever know where such\ngarments can be obtained.\nI hope in the future there will\nbe more consultation before this\nsort of project is repeated by\nFELIX but I must commend\nyou on your initiative.\nYours in an advanced state of\ndecay,\nJon Barnett\nFoul Fare\nDear FELIX\nEr I don't like to ask\nawkward questions...but then\nagain\u2014I didn't design it, I just\nuse it, so how can I be expected\nto know? What's happened to\nthe Great New Refectory Outlet\nwe were all expecting?\nThe Refectory has been put in\nanother room. The set of plastic\ntables has been replaced by\nanother set of plastic tables. The\nwalls are another colour....but\nwhat's the difference?\nIt's just as inefficient. The\nfood's just as bad. The same\nbored women serve it up and it's still as expensive!\nMaybe it's just me\u2014maybe I missed the article explaining\nwhat the differences are?\nHazel Cheesbrough\nEnts and\nMines\nDear Sir\nI write as a relieved Minesman\nfollowing the huge success of all\nthe Mines' fresher s' events of last\nweek. This success could have\nbeen possibly jeo pardi sed by the\nabominable attempt by those\npurveyors of false self-gratification IC Ents, who attempted\nto lead fresher s astray as early as\nSunday evening by selling their\nown 'all encompassing money-saving tickets.' This attempt to\npervert IC fresher s( to my\ndismay, even some RSMfreshers)\nbefore the rest of us have even\nhad a chance to get our hands on\nthem. Fortunately we were able\nto have the foresight to ban the\nsale of tickets in RS M and\norganise the passing on of those\ntickets that had been bought by\nRSM fresher s unsuspecting ly on\nthe Sunday, to other unsuspecting fresher s( RCS).\nI would like to finish by saying\nthis is not a slag on the quality or\ncontent of any of the IC Ents\nfresher s' events, but simply on\nthe way in which the tickets were\nsold, and the fact that RS M was\nnot asked in any way to contribute to those events. A bit\nbiased, don't you think?\nYours\nJohn Eagleson\nR SMU Poison in\nthe Poison\nDear Sir\nI wonder how many of your\nreaders have heard about the\nhorrible Tylenol scare which\ntook place in the USA only last\nweek\u2014seven lives were claimed\nin the Chicago area by cyanide\nhaving been put in capsules in\nplace of the very popular analgesic extra strength Tylenol.\nNow, I don't wish to cause a panic, and with reason and\ncommon sense the whole explosive situation can well be\ndefused, since there is still time\nto act, but the following happened to me only this morning: I was looking for a particular\nIII II ILl lI III III ILI IIII \u2022 \u2022 1 IIII IIII III Jli~i~i~i~ ri iii \u2122~i~i~ r~i~ i~i~i\" ir \u2022 i it it ii \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 i \u2022 ii \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\"\niii ii ill I_I\ni~ii~ i~ri~ i~i\"i~ r Here's the new look diary column;\nhope you approve. As I wrote last\nissue, I hope to produce it weekly,\nbut I can only do this if I'm regularly supplied with gripes and\ngossips. All contributions should\nbe sent to Below the Belt, FELIX,\nand naturally will be dealt with in\nstrictest confidence if you so\ndesire.\nHOW PLEASANT to have a Union President with some\n.character to him! I don't mean\nthis as any kind of criticism of\nlast year's President Nick Morton; Nick was cheerful,\nhardworking, helpful and\naltogether a thoroughly pleasant\nperson, but without any real\nquirks that a newspaper diarist\ncould write about. In the\nprevious year John Passmore\nwas lazy, Irish, and frequently\ndrunk, but there it stopped.\nNeither of them had any of the\nstyle of Stephen Goulder who,'\nwith his felt hat, his slightly affected pomposity, and his wonderful\nuse of the English language, is\nalready making quite a name for\nhimself as a gentlemanly eccentric. He is also a master of the\noblique insult. His de sci pti on of\none of the C CU presidents as\n\"not exactly overburdened with\ngrey matter\" was so much more\neloquent than simply describing\nhim as thick, and his put-down\nof former FELIX Editor Steve\nMarshall was nothing short of\nmasterly. \"Steve,\" he announced,\n\" you have what they call a magnetic personality\u2014you repel\npeople!\"\nSo when Dramsoc hack 'Eric'\nJarvis wrote a widely-praised\nletter to the post grad FELIX supporting Mary Freeman's attitudes and criticising the\nPresident as a pompous, self-admiring fool, I was surprised to\nhear SD G mutter something\nabout the letter containing \" a bone of truth.\" It isn't his\nadmission which surprises me so\nmuch as the word bone. Is this a special presidential ossi form truth, as opposed to the granular\ntruth the rest of us understand?\nMARY FREEMAN has, since\nbefore the start of term, been\npestering members of Union Council for their photographs to\ninclude in next week's FELIX. One wag presented me with this\npicture;\nI have undertaken not to\nname the disloyal fellow con-cern ed, provided he sends a better likeness by Monday, but I will award a Jingles haircut\nvoucher (my God, the generosity) to the first person who\ncorrectly identifies the hirsute\nyoung lady of the photograph.\nMORE NEWS of our old friend\nCaptain Lindley RN( re td). The\nCaptain is Domestic Secretary at\nIC and is therefore administrative superior to such as Mr Mooney, the Refectories Manager and Mr Reeves, Chief Security Officer. He is also no\nfriend of FELIX, largely due to\nthe efforts of the two previous\neditors.\nThe Captain is due for a well-deserved retirement in December,\nbut over the summer several\nUnion hacks and a reliable mole\nin Sherfield phoned the FELIX Office and gleefully announced\nthat the retirement had been\nbrought forward to September.\nNot one to print unsubstantiated\nrumour (despite recommendations from a former editor)\nFELIX phoned Jolly Jack's secretary who coldly told us that\nPage4| ( October15,1982 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nBRIAN TURNS THE SCREW The Rector has revealed that if the plans to charge IC students for use\nof the Science Museum Library go ahead, the library's rent will be\ndrastically increased, says the Union's External Affairs Officer Simon\nRodan.\nIn last week's FELIX the\n.proposals to charge students\nthirty pence per book were\ndescribed, and the article went\non to describe the Union's official protest at this. Lord Flowers has now told ICU President Stephen Goulder that\nhe opposes the charges and\nadded that in view of the\nGovernment's policy on further\neducation spending, the College\nwould have to re-assess its\nexpenditure on certain external\ninstitutions\u2014unless the proposals were shelved. Mr Rodan has\ninterpreted this as meaning that\nthe library's overheads, which\nuntil now have been heavily\nsub sidi sed by the College, would\nrise suddenly.\nIn a letter to Mr Goulder last\nweek, College Secretary John\nSmith said that he had not heard\nof the Union's protest until he\nread FELIX, but that he will be\nhappy to liaise with the Union in\nany further action that they may\nwish to take.\nAt present the library occupies\na rent-free site on campus, and\nIC pays all its heating and\nlighting bills. The proposed\nadditional charge is the result of\na report by Sir Derek George\nRayner (a director of Marks &\nSpencer) who has been appointed\nby the Government to look into\nreducing public sector spending.\nLord Flowers: reassessing expenditure on certain external institutions. Despite warnings from the Rector, from College Security, and from FELIX, it's still been a Bumper Week for\nThieves at IC\nThere has been a record number of thefts in the College in the past two\nweeks, despite repeated warnings from the Security department and a safety-conscious speech from the Rector.\nSince Lord Flowers' introductory speech to fresher s on\nOctober 4, six bicycles, seven\nwallets, and various cheque-books, cards, purses and items\nof electrical equipment have\nbeen stolen. The total value of\nthe bicycles alone is over \u00a3600,\nand Chief Security Officer Geoffrey Reeves is requesting all\nstudents who park their bicycles\nin the College to register them at\nthe Security Office on Level 1 of\nthe Sherfield Building next week.\nStudents should give a short\ndescription of their machine,\nincluding make, colour and\nframe number. This will make\nrecognition and recovery of\nbicycles a great deal easier if they\nare stolen; at present very few\nowners can give an accurate\nGeoffrey Reeves, Head of IC\nSecurity.\ndescription of their machines at\nall.\nSo far, bicycles have been\nstolen from in front of the\nCollege building, from the\nrailings to which they were\ncontinued on page 3.\nThe Science Museum Library: charges of 30p per book for IC students?\nNo.6231i Friday, October 15, 19821 I Free!

    "content": "This week FELIX presents a special film review section which looks at the latest\nreleases and gives a guide to films which you may have missed over the holiday\nperiod.\nThis may help you to sift through the hundreds of films showing in London and\nchoose a quiet evenings entertainment after the first hectic week.\nfurniture, breaking glass, etc\u2014but things start\nto turn nasty when the old k nar led tree outside\nthe children's bedroom trie's to consume young Robbie during a 'freak' thunderstorm. In\nthe confusion their young daughter Carol\nAnne, who has been talking to the what she\ncalls ' TV people' (ie the spirits), disappears\ncompletely, only to manifest herself as a frightened voice on an unused television\nchannel. She had been abducted to the spirit\nworld and, in much the same way as Close\nEncounters, the family have to get her back.\nAll this is marvellously done, but then the\nfilm changes gear. Steve consults a team of\nparapsychologist s who, spouting a mixture of\nscience and religious gobbled y gook, explain\nthat they have been plagued by a poltergeist. At this point the story begins to get confused\u2014Dr\nLes h( Beatrice Straight) explains that a poltergeist is not associated with a building (as\nwith a haunting) but with a person. Spielberg\npromptly ignores this and juxtaposes three or\nfour plots into one to create a final conf lug ration which has nothing to do with a poltergeist, but rather a haunting.\nAs the parapsychologist s call in midget\npsychic Tangina (Zelda Rubenstein) to, rescue\nCarol Anne from the spirit world, they witness\nsome spec tula r events, all created for the\nscreen in immaculate style by George Lucas'\n. effects team at Industrial Light and Magic.\nIndeed, the weakness of the plot is made up for\nenormously by the stunning visuals and some\ncheeky humour, which combine to make this a quaintly horrific but undemanding film.\nMy only criticism of the film (apart from the\nmisleading title) is that it carries an X certificate. Poltergeist is basically a' Walt Disney' horror film designed to have mass\nappeal, and thus it seems odd that it was not\nmade as aAA feature. Don't get me wrong, it\nis hugely entertaining and very scary at times\n(especially the lingering gap between the two\n'endings') but apart from one small scene there\nTo be Hooper shot to fame with the\ncontroversial cult hit The Texas Chainsaw\nMassacre and his latest film Poltergeist (X, Empire Leicester Square and locals) is\ncurrently London's top-selling film.\nAs you may have heard already there has\nbeen a certain amount of controversy over this\nfilm too, cent ring not on the horror elements,\nbut on who actually directed it. The confusion\nhas arisen because wunder kind Steven Spielberg had a great influence on the\nproject\u2014he wrote the screenplay from his own\nstory and produced the film. Indeed his name\ndominates the credits so much that the press\nhave tended to ignore Tobe Hooper's hard\nwork and credit Spielberg for directing the\npicture too. He denies this\u2014end of story?\nThe confusion is easy to understand though.\nRight from the start the film bears the Spielberg stamp, from the setting in a middle\nclass American suburb to the obsession with\nmysteries and child-like sense of wonder. It\ntells the story of the Freeling family, whose\nworld is turned upside down when a spirit\n(supposedly a poltergeist) enters their home\nthrough a television.\nProperty salesman Steve Freeling (Craig T Nelson) his wife Diane (Jobeth Williams) and\ntheir three children then start to witness a series of standard magic tricks \u2014 moving is no unnecessary gore. The children all act\nwell and the only danger to fourteen-year-olds\nwould be the scenes where the parapsychologist s start to take themselves seriously. But for a student audience it will only\nappeal to the young at heart or those who are\nfans of outstanding special effects. Still,\nrecommended.\nlive in fear!\" A few lines like these are priceless\nindications of the depth in the film's story. The\nsingle greatest improvement is in the character\nof Roy Batty (Ruger Hauer) the leader of the\nreplicants. Hauer dominates the latter half of\nthe film with an unnerving, evil performance\nculminating in a powerful cat and mouse game\nwith the terrified Deckard.\nDirector Ridley Scott (right) instructing Harrison Ford on the set of Blade Runner. This scene is a direct\nhomage to Ray Bradbury's classic Outer Limits episode Fiend with the Glass Hand.\nJobeth Williams is confronted by a ghostly apparition in Tobe Hooper's Poltegeist.\nA more important, if flawed, film is Ridley\nScott's Blade Runner (AA, Warner, ABC Fulham Rd, ABC Shaftesbury Avenue) starring Harrison Ford. This is fairly directly\nbased on Philip K Dick's excellent science\nfiction novel Do Androids Dream of Electric\nSheep? Dick was a gifted author who used the\nSF medium to express his own slightly views\non reality and life.\nHere futuristic bounty hunter Rick Deckard\n( Ford) is sent to kill four ' replicants' \u2014\ngenetically engineered people who have\nillegally returned to earth. In the process of\nhunting them down he starts to doubt not only\nti is profession, but also the place of androids in\nhis society. The film is set in the next century\nin a beautifully crafted city; flying cars fill the\npolluted skies and the overcrowded streets\nbustle with a predominantly oriental community. Man has advanced genetic\nengineering to the stage where he can produce\nperfect, d is pensi ble copies of himself as\nslaves\u2014androids, which are only used 'off\nworld' to spearhead the colonisation of outer\nspace.\nThe replicants are very strong, but have\nlittle experience of life and poorly developed\nemotions. For this reason they become erratic\nand their inventor, Tyrell (Joe Turkell), gives\nhis latest Nexus 6 models artificial memories\nwith a brief four year life span as a safety\nmeasure. When six Nexus 6 replicants hijack a shuttle and return to earth they become a danger and must be ell imina ted. The film retains most of the passion for life\nwhich Dick's book expresses so well and it\neven improves on it slightly. \"There's nothing\nworse than having an itch you can never\nscratch!\" mouths Leon as he tries to brutally\nkill Deckard, \" Now you know what it's like to\nThe film is visually stunning with a look\nwhich is a cross between Scott's Alien and\nSpielberg's Close Encounters (not surprising\nas Douglas Trumball supplies the magnificent\nspecial effects were too) but it does have\nobvious faults.\nThose who dislike serious science fiction\nmay as well forget it straight away. Despite\nsome concessions to commercial pressures\n(an unnecessary narration and slightly overblown violence) the story projects a very\nserious, if gloomy, point about life and death. It\nrequires some effort to understand and those\nexpecting Indiana Jones vs The Robots merely\nbecause Harrison Ford stars will come away\ndisappointed. Indeed, American audiences\nwere generally disappointed by Ford and not\nthe film itself (he gives a reasonable performance\nas a terrified anti-hero, who is constantly\noverpowered by his superior adversaries not\nIndiana Jones at all!).\nYou won't come out of this one feeling\nelated, but I'm convinced that it is an\nimportant step towards putting more serious\nscience fiction back on the big screen.\nSo far I seem to have only raved about the\nsummer's good releases, so here's a warning\nabout some less desire able films.\nThe most disappointing film of the summer\nwas certainly Conan The Barbarian starring\nArnold Schwarzeneggar. Despite glimpses of\npromise, it really is a monumental bore, with\nJohn Milius wasting a decent story by banal\nscripting and unimaginative filming. Conan\nmumbles incomprehensibly and every time\nsomeone gets on a horse the orchestral soundtrack wheezes back into clich ed 'riding\nboldly' format. It reminded me of a two hour\ntitle sequence performed by a cast of\ncharacter less dummies.\n| October 15, 1982\nFar less disappointing, but still bad in a sense was John Carpenter's The Thing (X, ABC s), supposedly a remake of the classic\nHoward Hawk's film The Thing From Another t World. I can honestly say that the special\neffects totally overwhelm the pitiful story\u2014but\nboy oh boy, you just will not believe your eyes!\nEffects wizard Rick Baker( of American Werewolf in London fame) has conspired to\nproduce the most sickeningly repulsive and\nhorrific set of convincing effects I have ever\nseen. This is a new type of horror\u2014let's say\n' hardcore' horror \u2014 which is far more interesting and physically moving than any of\nthe recent glut of slash the teenager movies.\nBut as one reviewer has already said\u2014Things\njust ain't what they used to be (groan!).\nDenis Potter's play Brimstone & Treacle\n(X, Classics Haymarket, Oxford St) was\noriginally intended for the BBC, but its film\nincarnation with Sting in the lead role of\nMartin Taylor (which one, I hear you ask in\nunison) turns out surprisingly well.\nFilmed virtually compete ly in a small house,\nit has the feel of a play and may have been\nbetter set on the stage. It opens with Martin\nbumping into Thomas Bates (Denholm Elliot)\nand talking his way into the Bates' home. He pretends to be a friend of their daughter, who\nfor three years has been a helpless mute since\nan unfortunate accident. The beautiful young\ngirl cannot feed herself or communicate with\nthe outside world and so when Martin offers to\nhelp look after his long lost love, Mrs Bates\nseizes on the chance to relieve the constant\npressure of work.\nMr Bates is less enthusiastic. He suspects\nMartin's ruse and fears the worst, but is\neventually won over. Meanwhile Sting is busy\nmolesting his daughter in the living room.\nj^&I STONE The film is interesting and well shot, but\nwas a little too short. The sudden ending\nmanages to carry the central point of the\nplay \u2014 that good and evil are not totally\ndistinguishable and that some thoroughly evil\nacts may have good( if embarrassing) consequences. Whilst not being too explicit,\nthe morality of Martin Taylor's actions is\nsometimes surprising (I always had my doubts\nabout him) even shocking.\nAs for Sting, it is very fortunate that he has\nto look as if he's acting most of the time\nV The initial reaction when watching Diva is\nmixed; it opens with a ten minute opera scene\nwhere a post boy illegally records his favourite\nstar Diva, a woman who refuses to make\nrecordings for sale. Later he also comes into\npossession of a tape which exposes a drug\nsyndicate and ends up being pursued by just\nabout everybody.\nWhilst the plot may at first seem fairly\nsimple, it turns into a complex and unusual\nthriller of Hitchcock proportions, which is very\nwell crafted and beautifully filmed. It is these\nqualities which have rocketed its French director, Jean Jaque s Beine ix to instant\nstardom.\nBeineix has combined a series of simple\nplots to provide a stylish film with a certain\ndreamlike quality. The post boy is pursued by\ndangerous thugs and oriental gangsters through a world populated by comic strip\ncharacters and incredible pop-art backdrops.\nThe look of the film, switching between night\ntime Paris and almost surreal sets, is all\nimportant and I don't think I can recommend\nthis odd film highly enough. It is now showing\nexclusively at the Odeon High St Kensington\nand the Screen on the Hill at Belsize Park.\nEqually impressive, if far less exciting is\nWerner Herzog' s epic Fitzcarraldo (A, Camden Plaza). This is a hugely ambitious film\nset in South America at the turn of the\ncentury.\nKlaus Kin ski stars as Brian Sweeny Fitzgerald( known as Fitz carr aldo), an Irishman obsessed by the notion of building an\nopera house in the jungle. To do this he hits\nupon several fanciful schemes, culminating in a plan which involves dragging a massive riverboat over a hill to reach an otherwise\ninaccessible supply of rubber. This he achieves\nwith considerable effort, but his crazy scheme\nis doomed to failure.\nThe film is all about obsession and the story\nof its production is interesting, in itself. For ht is reason maverick documentary maker Les\nBlank (do you remember Garlic is as good as\n10 mothers or Werner Herzog Eats his Shoe?)\n.i. Burden of Dreams, now showing at\nthe Paris Pullman. This shows the pains to\nwhich Herzog went to film the story. He moved his actors to the middle of the Amazonian jungle and, despite numerous setbacks, eventually succeeded in pulling a full\nsize boat over a hill. Herzog confesses that he\nsometimes doubted his own sanity and the\ndocumentary is a testament to his brilliance as\nan obsessive film maker.\nMark Smith\n|Page9\n\n"
