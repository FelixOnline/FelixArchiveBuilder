Mr Phillips' case is that he does not\nbelieve in such awards and besides it would be inappropriate he feels, to give himself an award.\nOn the first point, if he does not believe in UGA's then he should have given none out. Indeed he has been\nin the best position to campaign for their abolishment\nbut he has not done this.\nOn the second point, it is not up to Mr Phillips to\naward himself a UGA: it is simply up to him either accept\nor reject it and he has done the latter. And yet he has\naccepted the award of social colours.\nEx-officio awards are those awards which have been\nagreed upon by the Union and are automatically awarded\nto certain people who are to be saved from the em baras sing paradox of having to present awards to themselves, i.e. the a warder does not give himself an award; rather, the\naward is given to him ex-officio on behalf of the Union.\nThus Mr Phillips is not refusing to give himself an\naward; he is refusing to accept it. And considering that\nhe accepted social colours, I find the situation approximately daft.\nWhy don't you just come out and say it, Trevor, that\nyou have an aversion of ties?\nLast week saw the return to the practice of producing\njust one issue of FELIX per week. The two issues per\nweek experimental pilot scheme was successful inasmuch\nthat it has now been proven that one person can produce\ntwo four-pagers a week when the rest of the staff are\nbusy studying for their exams.\nThe scheme has had one drawback however: morale.\nAn eight or twelve page FELIX is a newspaper; a four-pager is a just a news sheet. The feedback has been\neither general sympathy (from those who recognise the\nproduction difficulties) or open disappointment at the\nsize (from those who do not). The two-a week idea still\nhas possibilities, but that will be up to future Editors.\nCriticism of 'Parking Problem' Article\n20'h May, 1975.\nDear Sir, Re: your art ic fe dated 16th May under the heading of\nParking Problems.\nParking has always been a problem and always will be,\nat the feet of the Parking Committee. Unlike Police Traffic Wardens, John Fuller and Co do not have the authority\nto take matters into their own\nhands and they have to use a great deal of tact in performing\ntheir duties. The majority of\nstudents consider that John\ndoes a great job well. So I fail\nto understand what was meant\nby your article. Could it be\nthat you have run out of material\nor is Jacqui Gerrard jealous\nbecause she has no car? Please FELIX, we do not attack\nstudents, so do not attack\nmembers of staff who are only\ndoing their jobs.\nRon Parker\nMessenger Elec .Eng.\n(The whole lone of this\nletter amazes me . In what was\na straight forward investigative\nstory, 1 simply reported the\nstatistics and both sides of\nthe argument. I was most\ncareful not to take sides on the\nissue. Therefore your allegation\nthat I \"attacked\" (heaven\nforbid!) John Fuller, the Parking\nWarden, is totally unfounded.\n1 suggest you re-read the\nart ic le ^-Ed .) .\nIf ORLY\nMargaret Slimming\nTHE RUMOURS surely can't be true - that we've upset a number of you? C 'mon lads, stop sulking and accept the apologies\nof we humble IF girls! Actually, I'm flattered that you read our\ncolumn avidly enough to make you so touchy! (Did I say it right,\nMike?). Seriously though, folks, no offence whatsoever was meant\nby last week's article, and we\ntruly felt that none would be\ntaken. So can we forget it and\nall be friends again? Good!\nAt the moment, the foremost\nthing in most peoples' minds\nare those nasty things that are\nlooming in the nerve-racking ly close future - what away to\nspoil the summer! Mind you, I think we have had the summer\n(so short and sweet was it,\nanyone had blinked, they would\nhave missed it!). It was so determined, in fact,\nto transform my lily-white skin\ninto a deep brown tan that I even forewent my earlier\npromises of studying last\nTuesday afternoon In favour of\na quiet afternoon blinking in\nthe sunshine and doing the\nnearest to a decent strip that\nI could (no, not to the chords\nof a famous but rather hackneyed\ntune!). The trouble about being\nblonde (or is it \"pale and\ninteresting\"?) is those \" light brown spots on the skin\"( accord ing to the concise Oxford\nDictionary), which do not mean\na sudden attack of acne, but an\nattack of freckles!! Anc mine are certainly not light\nbrown \u2014 more a delicate shade\nof bright orange!\nStill, there's no danger of\nthat this weekend! Funny, isn't it, but wherever I go, it always\nseems to rain. I mean, last\nweekend, I decided to stay In\nLondon \u2014 and what happened?\nIt rained the whole time, didn't it? Meanwhile, \" back home\"\nwas in brilliant sunshine! This weekend, I decided to go home\n\u2014 so, what has it done since I arrived? Yes, you've guessed,\nrain! So cursed am I, in fact, by\nrain, that a friend sent me a snoopy card telling me to \"let\na smile be my umbrella\". But, the way things are going, I'll be walking around with a set\ngrin on my face for the rest of\nmy days!\nAnyway, I hope I have\nbrought a little sunshine into\nyour lives and taken your minds\noff exams, even if It was only\nfor a few minutes.\nGood luck to one and all, keep smiling and have a sunny\nsummer!\nIF Only Criticism (1)\n24th May, 1975 .\nDear Michael,, I may be a feminist but did\nyou know that I also have a baby?

My\neye twitched when Lorna Thomas announced last week\nthat she was going to write\ns ome th ing\" pleasant ly munda ne \"\nbut for Baby to become a humble intruder in the pages of\nFELIX... that really is going\ntoo far. One or two points\ndeserve attention:-1. It is hardly consistent (to\nsay the least) that Miss Thomas\nshould accuse others of\nla urchin g into \"indiscriminate\ncriticism\" of IC and conclude\nher article bu urging \"budding\npoliticians at IC to step down\nfrom their bro ing, extremist\nplatforms.\"\n2. It is hypocritical of her to\ncry out against the apathy of\nothers with regard to Rag collecting, when her face has certainly escaped mine on all past Rag collections.3. It is unprofessional on her\npart not to check her facts:\nroughly half the girls at IF, not\ntwo thirds, commute . ie., spend\nmore than an hour getting to\ncollege. I am sure that it would be\nfor more to the point if Lorna\noutlined her plans for Rag next\nyear. Baby would be so much\nhealthier too.\nYours sincerely, Katie Mackinnon, IF\nIF Only Criticism (2)\nImperial College Union\n27th May, 1975\nSir,\nIt is some time since\nanything angered me as much\nas last week's \"IF Only\".

    "content": "MU X7 DEMOCRACY AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY Tony Jones\nDURING THE public debate on continued membership of the\nEuropean Community much has been said about the bureaucratic\nand undemocratic nature of its decision-making process. That the\npresent arrangement does not match up to the British concept of\ndemocracy is undeniable, yet\nplayed down by so many of\nthose who believe in a united\nEurope. Indeed.it is ironic that\nin the recent TV debate between\nMichael FoStand Edward Heath\non sovereignty and the\nCommunity, it was Mr Foot who\npresented the more reasoned\nand accurate assessment. There is no point In denying\nthat Britain, as a political unit, Is losing an amount of\nself-government \u2014 that is the\nessence of a supranational\norganisation such as the\nEuropean Community. What\ngives cause for concern Is that\nthis \" sovereignty\" being\ntransferred from Westminster,\nis going to the executive\nCommission and Council of\nMinisters. Although the\nMinisters are responsible to\ntheir national parliaments, this\ncan hardly be claimed to be a satisfactory arrangement.\nThe European Parliament\nhas tended to be overlooked,\nand even scorned. In the debate\nover the past few months . Yet\nhere we have an embryonic\nCommunity legislature of 198\nMP's meeting once a month,\nwaiting for the day when it can\nassume control over Community\naffairs from the Commission\nand Council. At the moment Its\npowers are limited but real. Not\nonly does It sc rut in is e proposed\nlegislation from Brussels, but\nIt can dl s miss its own executive, the entire Commission, on a vote of no confidence \u2014 a power denied to many national\nso-called \" parliaments\". It\nhas curbed the Commission's one-time enthusiasm for\n\" harmon ising\" everything In\nsight (remember the infamous\n\" Euro beer\"?), and its control\nover Community expenditure\nhas now been increased from\n3% to about 20%. But perhaps\nmost important is its right to\nchallenge the executive, to\nquestion, to criticise and to\nspeak out .The influx of British Members has brought a wind of\nchange in this direction. With\nthe innovation of a Westminsterstyle Question Time 1224\nit is unfortunate that this point is\nQuestions were tabled in 1973\n\u2014 our first year of membership\n\u2014 and both written and oral\nanswers are supplied by the\nCouncil and the Commission, both of whom are represented\nin the House. At the present, Members are\nnominated from national\nparliaments, but the Treaty of\nRome provides for direct\nelections to be held on a Community-wide basis. The\nsummit conference last\nDecember confirmed that\nelections should be held as soon as practicable, and in\nJanuary Parliament approved a Dutch socialist MP on the\nprocedure for such elections .\nThe \" Pati jn Report\", with\nam mend ment s, calls for the\nParliament to be enlarge from\n198 to 355 seats, 67 of which\nwould be allocated to UK Members, with elections taking\nplace on a target date of May\n8th1978, but not later than\nMay 1980.\nIt now remains for the\nPatijn Report to be approved\nby the Heads of Government,\nbut it is vitally important to\nthe future of the Community\nthat it develops along democratic lines. Direct\ne lect ions wi11g ive the European\nParliament the teeth it needs\nto demand full control over\nCommunity affairs. The House\nof Commons has had to fight\nfor democratic control and the\nEuropean Parliament will have\nto as well. The European Community is\nthe nucleus around ' which a united Europe will be built.\nFar from being a static, faceless bureaucracy, It is in a continual process of development and evolution, and\nwe, the people of Europe, can\nand must mould it to the shape\nwe want. It was Winston\nChurchill who said of European\nunity \u2014 \"We are not building a machine: we are growing a living plant\".\n\"The European Community is the nucleus around which\na united Europe will be built.\"\nIF YOU have some ladies' hockey club kit or sticks,\nPLEASE return it as soon as possible to Shirley\nFairweather. If you have some kit from last year,\nreturn it now \u2014 no questions asked.\nReturn it to Falmouth Hall or Che m.Eng. Letter racks.\nThere will be 50 rooms in Hall available for IC\nstudents looking for accommodation. They are on a night\nto night basis on Saturday to Wednesday (20th \u2014 24th September) night before beginning of term.\nYou must bring a sleeping bag NO sheets will be\nprovided.

    "content": "A FELIX\nREVIEWS\nRECORDS Andrew Osborne\nSean Barker\nCities in Modern Britain\nTHIS BOOK is an introductory reader\nin urban sociology which is a frame of\nreference, an approach, which allows us\nto make some sense of our society. It\ncollects statistics about, for example,\nthe housing conditions of the various\nclasses and racial groups in an urban\npopulation, and provides a perspective in\nwhich to view these statistic, a perspective\nwhich plays an important part in the\nshaping of society. To dismiss sociology\nas 'wooly' and imprecise is to deny the\nvalue of town planning and social aid programmes .\nTo introduce a layman to ideas of\nsociology is not easy, and can create\nmore confusion and misunderstanding than\nalready exists. This book avoids presenting the esoteric ramifications of\nfashionable theories, or masses of\nun discernible statistics. What it does is\na large number of highly readable extracts\nfrom various papers and books on a broad range of subjects. The extracts are\nin various sections, such as \"Theories of\nCities,\" and \" People and Places\", each section containing an introduction\nto set the passages in context, and an\nappendix of books for those who wish to\nstudy the subjects in depth. This book\ndoes what it set out to do very well, and\nanyone writing an introductory book on\nany subject would do well to take note of\nthe techniques it uses. Philip Webber\nJ.P. Donleavy: A Fairy Tale in New\nYork (Penguin).\nSUDDENLY THE usual has taken on a quality of humour after this book Don lea vy manages to make you laugh at the genera I ly\nunfunny and the positively macabre.\nOur hero Cornelius Christian has\nquite stunning talents for women, fighting\nand just surviving to the next day by the\nskin of his teeth. He charts a rather\ncurious course through New York, the city of his childhood. Occupations which range from in a funeral parlour to an\nadvertising agency give some idea of his\ndiversification. Donleavy is continually inventive and\nhilariously funny, you would recognize\nCornelius strutting down the street\ntowards you after reading this book .\nJames Wilkinson\nPhilip Warner: British Battlefields*\n\"The South\" and \"The North\"(Fontana).\nTHESE ARE the first two of four books\ndesigned to form a handbook dealing with\nthe major battles fought on English and\nScottish soil, from Arthur's victory at\nMount Baden in AD516 to the butchery\nof Cumberland at Culloden in 1746. They\nare both a remarkable exercise in historical reconstruction, containing not only\ndetails of the battles themselves, but why\nthey were fought and what the results\nwere.\nMost of the battles covered occured\nduring the Wars of the Roses. Treachery\nabounds with nobles changing sides between,\nbattles. The culmination of all this being\nBosworth Field(1485) at which half the\narmies were never committed (their\ncommanders waited to see who was going\nto win). Hence Richard HI: was left\nstumbling around in a swamp crying \",A horse! A horse! etc ...\"\nThese very readable accounts are\nwritten by Philip Warner Senior-Lecturer\nat Sandhurst. So all you followers of cut\nand thrust, here's historically accurate\ngore for you! Plus details of how to get to yer actual places where It all happened.\nJohn Andrews\nStanislair Andreski: Social Sciences\nas Sorcery (Penguin).\nTHE PURPOSE of this book Is to\nexplain to the reader that a considerable\npercentage of what he reads in the social science vein Is quite possibly unoriginal,\nuninteresting and almost unreadable.This,\nhe says, is because most people writing\nIn this subject tend to do so In a style\nwhich has the effect of Impressing readers\nnot by what is being said, but by the fact\nthat the continual use of fl ve6y ll able words, 'jargon* and basically confusing\nprose covers up the true meaning of what\nis actually being said. The only trouble\nwith the book is that he could have made\nthis point quite concisely in a chapter;\ninstead, he spends 250 pages on the same\ntopic, and quite frankly this gets rather\nboring after a while. In the end he\nbecomes a victim of his own argument;\nand he Is not averse to the odd indulgence\nin unnecessarily over-long words himself\n\u2014 one chapter Is entitled \"Techno-Totemism and Creeping Crypto-Totalitarianism\", which I think illustrates my\npoint. For bored sociological freaks only.\nGeorges Simenon: The Eighth Simenon\nOmnibus (Penguin).\nTHE SIMENON Omnibus series\nconsists of collections of, in general,\nthree short stories about the French\nanswer to Sherlock Holmes, the diffident\nInspector Maigret. I haven't read any of\nthe others but I should imagine this Is a reasonably typical example . All three are\nset in Paris, and Simenon, although a Belgian by birth, has an uncanny gift for\ncapturing the atmosphere of the city and\nexpressing it in a handful of sentences;\nthis knack gets him a gold star in my\nestimation, as personally I find interminable descriptive paragraphs tedious in the\nextreme. The stories themselves are\npleasant enough; I'm afraid that that's about It really, they're well written and\nreasonably interesting, but you won't find much edge-of-the-seat stuff here. If\nyour detective abilities are anything\nabove that of a baboon you shouldn't have\na great deal of trouble in figuring out who\nthe baddies are; rumour has It that they\nall wear black berets anyway.\nDesmond Young: Rommel (Fontana).\nI HAVE always rated war books as\napproximately equal to westerns in\ninterest level: both float around uncomfortably close to absolute zero. This book\nleaves them all way behind. Perhaps if\nyou were a historian you'd enjoy it; you\nwould also be in a better position to\nreview It than me, as you'd no doubt have\nconsiderably more experience at digesting\nbooks of this type . Biographies are odd\nthings to review; you can't describe the\nplot, because there isn't one, and the\nonly opinion you can safely give is on\nthe character of the person described. This, in effect, Is like writing your own\nextremely short biography . Anyway, here\ngoes. ( Pause). Field \u2014 Marshall Rommel,\nthe 'Desert Fox', was a man whose skill as a military commander and tactician was matched only by his huge narrow-minded r ness. Nothing interested him ex c ppt war and the German Army. Nevertheless he\nappears to have been somewhat more\nintelligent and, perhaps, fairer than many\nof his colleagues. He committed suicide\nafter being accused of plotting to kill Hitler. Jimmy Osmond: Little Arrows\n(MGM Records).\nMY INITIAL reaction to this record\nwas that it was playing at 78rpm. I was\nwrong, and having turned the treble down\nI was able to receive this offering from\nthe remarkable Osmond camp with the\nminimum of pain. Intense concentration is\nrequired to interpret the meaning and\npurpose packed into every second of the\nmusic but it soon becomes clear that this\nis a contribution to contemporary minstrels y of prime importance.\nThe album takes the usual Osmond\nviewpoint presenting a dogmatically\nMarxian exposition of life in our capitalist society, maintaining a scientific rig our throughout and encouraging revolution.\nThe musical' vehicle for Mr Osmond's message is the call contradiction response, a dialectical method now\ncommon on the pop scene. \"Little arrows\", the Leap y Lee hit,\nis the opening track. But this version is\na remarkable reinterpretation substituting\n\"Little Ear 'ole s\" for \"Little Arrows\"\npresumably to indicate the omnipresence\nof CIA devices, although I get the feeling\nthat it might be due to an unfortunate\nspeech impediment. \"Day O\" describes\nthe experiences of a worker in a banana\nfactory and utilise s a reggae ry th m to\nsuggest repetition.\nTaking a firm grip on his concepts\nMr Osmond staggers forward to excrete\nhis accumulated philosophy into the\nreceptacle of his audience and deftly\nflushes away false consciousness with\n\"Purple People Eater\". The monster in\nquestion is plainly the corrupt imperialist\nAmerican system. This is followed by\n\"Don't You Remember\" in which the\nopposing rhythms of percussion and\nstrings synthesis e an explosion of aural,\nstimulation which is designed to instil solidarity into the pop fans of the/ world\nand encourage rejection of the treacherous\nfan club leadership who have become\nideologically separated from their rank\nand file members.\nThe record should work wonders for\nThe Osmonds' economic infrastructure but\nluckily their in a class by themselves. If asked for a neutral assessment I would say that the album is rather like a diet of enchiladas and green chile sandwiches \u2014 acceptable if ones palate is\nattuned to the treatment but after a while its surely enough to make the strongest\nman reach for the para cet a mal. \u00ab w BOOK,S "

There is general agreement that it lacks something in style; we have been asked, and are very willing to help in revamping the\nthe College prospectus.\nHowever the \" Alternative\" prospectus provides a necessary\nsupplement to this. There is much evidence that sixth-former s are increasingly cynical about the value of higher education,\nand judging by the drift to the polytechnics, about university\neducation in particular. The Manchester and Cambridge student\nprospectuses clearly managed to overcome this cynic i um in a way that no College or University prospectus, however well written and presented ever could. The crux of the matter lies in the prospective student's perception of the College. Rightly or wrongly, (I think rightly)\nhe feels that the only true and accurate indication of life at IC\nwill come from students themselves. This, of course, is why we students take them around in interview groups. This is also why the Alternative Prospectuses have had such an impact on\nsixth-former s. The Alternative Prospectus is not a gimmicK. Nor is it an attempt to indulge in an orgy of criticism of particular aspects of\nthe College. We would like to present an honest and balanced\nstudent view, and to that end, we would want to spread the\nauthorship as far as possible. I would expect, in the end, that\nover 150 people will have contributed, including year reps,\nunion officers, and even \" average students.\" We are as concerned as anyone about the decline in student\nnumbers. The Union's income depends on keeping those numbers\nup. I think that the fears of a number of academics may be\nallayed if they were to have a few words with their colleagues\nin other institutions.where student prospectuses have been\nintroduced.\n*\nThe defeat of Leeds United in the European Cup Final, tragic as it was, is probably significant in the context of the\nEEC referendum. The Yorkshiremen worked hard, skilfully and well and at the end had nothing to show for it. The Munich\nteam, contributed little to the game \u2014 except two goals, and at\nthe end, took the Cup and all the TV coverage. What reason did the commentators give for the Bayer Munich win? The big money\nspent to bring a new coach from the United States.\nNever mind. The World Cup comes next and I have every\nconfidence in Don Re vie, provided he doesn't play Alan Ball, nor Norman Hunter. (Fascist pig! \u2014 Ed.).\nThe referendum is next Thursday.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FREE! No. 392 FRIDAY30 TH MAY,1675. DON'T RAISE\nOUR FEES!\nA PEACEFUL PICKET of a meeting of the Imperial College Board of Governors took\nplace last Friday morning. The picket was in protest against the Government Proposals\n(to raise .the undergraduate and postgraduate tuition fees by \u00a370) which the Governing\nBody was being asked to ratify.\nAbout fifteen people took\npart In the protest which was organised by the Overseas\nStudents Committee to highlight\nthe particular plight of those\nstudents who have come from\nabroad to study here and are\nnow being forced to pay \u00a3330\nper session( both undergraduates\npay just \u00a3165 and P.G.' s \u00a3155.\nA letter was presented to\nSir Henry Fisher, the Governing\nBody Chairman, outlining the\ndifficulties in which many of\nthe overseas students at IC\nnow find themselves. (The\nletter is reprinted below).\nIn his reply to the letter on\nbehalf of the Governing Body,\nthe Rector said that the\nGovernors \"gave lengthy and\nsympathetic consideration\" to\nthe points which had been\nraised but they never e the less \"felt it necessary to implement\nthe increase in fees for 1975-76 as recommended by the\nSecretary of State tor Education\nand Science\".\nThe Rector further explained\" it this income (from the\nincreased fees) is not obtained,\nthen the College may be forced\nto review its planned expend i ture, perhaps having to make\nundesirable cuts in its services\nor facilities. I am sure that\nthis would be unwelcome both\nto staff and students,...\"\nThe College has, however,\nbeen given facilities to enable\nthe extra fees to be remitted,\nin whole or in part, for such\nstudents for whom the increases\nhave caused financial hardship.\nStudents in this position\nshould obtain application forms\nfrom Mr J Bevan in Room 344,\nthe Sherfield Building. In\nThe picket line outside the Rector's residence.\nWeeks Hall WEEKS HALL is to accommodate staff and students over the\nsummer and will return to full\nuse as a hall of residence next\nsession.\nThis announcement, which\nwas made at last Friday's meeting of the Governing Body' s finance and executive commit-tee, stated that contractual\nwork will have to be carried\nout probably next summer in order to reinforce the building,\nbut in the meantime the hall can be regarded as safe so long as\nthe safety regulations are adhered to. Bike Thefts\nTWO RACING bicycles, both of\nwhich were secured by a chain,\nhave recently been stolen.\nThe first bike, a purple Pu ch Prima belonging to J. Champ, a Biochem UG, was taken on\nThursday, May15 th at about\n3.1 5 pm in Fulham Road near\nEvelyn Gardens.\nThe other, a very expensive\nyellow Holdsworth belonging\nto J.. Cavanagh of Botany 1,\nwas taken from near the Sherfield Building main entrance by\nthe stairs between 3 3 0 and6.30 pm on Tuesday, May 20th. Anyone spotting either of\nof these two bicycles should\ncontact either the police or the\nabove named owner.\nthe words of the Rector, \"all\nsuch applications will be given\nthe most sympathetic\nconsideration\".\nWhen asked for his comments, Mr Chris Kourouniotis, the Chairman of the\nOverseas Students Committee\nsaid \"The Rector's reply to\nour letter was very uns at is factory. The seriousness of the\neffects of a decision not to\nImplement the increase to the\nCollege's financial position Is\ndoubtful. According to the\nUnion's information, the\ndifference would be about\n\u00a350,000 per annum, an amount\nwhich cannot seriously\nchallenge the College's situation either way. Our\nslogan Is apt: Universities\ncannot run on money alone,\nthey need students too.\"\nImperial College Union\n2 2nd May, 1 975 .\nDear Sirs,\nWe note the government's proposal for an increase of \u00a370 in\ntuition fees for all students and that the implementation is at\nyour disc re tion.\nWe would like to point out some of the major effects of this\nincrease which will have an adverse effect on students. In the\nlower sectors of the education system, namely primary and\nsecondary schools. This will be in the form of a reduction in\nthe amount of money available to the LEA's on top of the\nrecent cutbacks in education spending .\nIn particular the increase will cause a lot of hardship to\nself supporting students and especially to those already paying\nat the overseas rate. This will deter many prospective students\nwho fall in the self supporting category (mainly postgraduates)\nand have a detrimental effect on the research carried out in\nthis college .\nWe therefore strongly urge you to put the interests of the\nstudents and the College first, by refusing to increase the fees.\nYours faithfully,\nC. Kouroumotis,\nChairman\nOverseas Students Committee\nS. Mohindra\nChairman-elect\nOverseas Students Committee\n\n"

The major teething troubles had been sorted out\nlast year and in October we eagerly anticipated an eventful and\nsuccessful season. Our hopes were boosted when about eight\nFreshers joined us. Our first sortie was to the annual UL U seven-a side tournament at Motspur\nPark, where we fielded eight\npeople, taking turns to s it out.\nIdo not remember the score,\nbut I gre a ned inwardly when\nabout five of our players were\nasked to attend the UL U trials the following weekend. The seven-a side tournament is a pre-selection for the University\nteam trials, and those selected\nto play for UL U generally\ndisappear down to Malet Street,\nnever to be seen again by lesser mortals! However, on realising this, our patriotic IC Ladies excused themselves\nfrom the trials for various\nreasons, that is, all except Viv Hughes, who became the UL U team Treasurer and is next\nyear's Captain. Congratulations\nViv! \u2014 but we do miss you. Our first match was versus\nKing's College. For some\nreason, King's had a bomb\nscare that morning, so at around\n12.30 pm I was informed that\nthey had all been evacuated\nfrom the building (with their kit inside), no-one knew whether\nthey had got a team and would\nwe detain one of our coaches\nuntil they arrived at IC? Of course, the coach driver would\nnot wait, and I was left to wait\nfor King's. I think three girls\nturned up, who thought that the\nrest had gone straight to\nHarlington in a car.S oI took\nthese out by Greenline bus and\nwalked up to the ground (\u2014no\nmean treat when you are unfit!\u2014)\nto be greeted by the rest of\nKing's and of course IC. Disappointingly, they beat us\n4\u20143 (only because we didn't have a goalie). The weather\nwas not on our side after that\nand many matches were rained\noff.\nThe next memorable occasion was at Royal Holloway. Our\neight vs their eleven was a positively unfair to sliceD ian a's ear off with a high ball( well, almost!). I think we\nshould be proud of that score:\n13\u20141 to R.H. It was shear\ngenius to get that goal of ours.\nAgain, yours truly was \" kicking\nback\" in the absence of a goalie. My motto \u2014 when in goal, duck! We played a few other\nmatches, but during the first\nterm most were rained off, and\nso en thus i as i um disappeared\nboth a tIC and other colleges, and many of the remaining\nmatches were called off because\nof the lack of players. We came\nabout half-way up the final\nleague table, which was a good result. I hope that IC Ladies do much better next\nyear, under Diana Mounsey\n(Captain) and Sarah Horn\n(Secretary).\nwould like to wish\nall its readers\nTHE BEST OF LUCK\nWITH THEIR EGZA MS!\n\n"
