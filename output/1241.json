    "content": "0 2 NEWS FELIX Beit Quad Improved?\nBeit Quadrangle, the grounds outside the Union building, were refurbished over the holidays, mainly to\nremove the unsafe surfaces and\nimprove wheelchair access.\nThe new design leaves the Quad\nentirely without steps, though\nmuch of the original paving was\nretained and reused. The Quad\nnow has paths around the outside\nand a single central path from the\nQuad archway through to the main\nUnion entrance. As reported previously in Felix, the aim was for a more Cambridge-like quadrangle\nfeel, but we might have been taking the piss.\nThere has been some concern\namong Union drinkers using the\ntables outside about the 'bonded\ngravel' which has been used to\ncover those areas which aren't on\nthe main path, but which are also\nunsuitable for turfing due to heavy\ntraffic. The gravel is rapidly\n'un bonding', creating more of a sandpit effect and problems for\nthose charged with sweeping the\nquad of cigarette butts.\nApart from that, it is hoped the\nnew layout will satisfy the Health\nand Safety Executive who argued\nthat the previous paving was a trip\nhazard in event of a fire, which\nmight lead to a nighttime stampede\nof drunk students if it occurred during a large Union event. Despite\nUnion interests, however, the project received only a small amount of\nfunding from the Union for some\nadditional facilities, the remainder\ncoming from College.\nThe greatest challenge yet for the\nnew quad will be Freshers Week,\nwhich will no doubt see many\nattempts to destroy it.

This special pullout is\ndesigned to help you navigate your way around the now\nlegendary Imperial College Union Freshers Fair. At one\nor more of the unassuming trestle tables you will hopefully find an activity or group that you will end up\nspending a fair proportion of your non-study time with.\n1 believe they call it \"Having Fun!\" And how right they\nare. The fair is by far the best opportunity to become\ninvolved in one of the 250+ clubs and societies and\nstart having the most fun in your university life!\nThe M DH is a bit of amish mash, with companies\nalong one side, sport and recreational clubs down the\nother side, with a financial-industrial-business-type corner for good measure!\nIn the JCR, the religious societies are in the centre,\nwith various other social and recreational clubs represented around the edges. And the Sir Alexander\nFleming building is the place for clubs run by the\nmedic student association and businesses of interest to\nmedics, which are open to all.\nAcross the road in the Union Building, there is a plethora of activity! The stage in Beit Quad will host a number of performances from the artistic and musical\nsocieties as well as demos from martial arts clubs and\nfencing. The Quad will also be home to the Union Ents\nstall, where you can purchase tickets to all Union fresh-ers week events such as the Super Heroes Party on\nFriday night. The RAG stall is also here, so sign up to\ndo crazy things throughout the year in aid of good ca us es. There is also a cluster of adventure clubs here, as\nwell as the Felix\nstall and others.\nThose of you with\nan artistic streak\nshould head for the\nconcert hall, which\nPhew! Having made that bold\nstatement, it's time for the good\nnews for those of you who may be\nthinking that they don't wish to\njoin anything at all.\nAs usual, we have a number\nof commercial companies visiting us, with the aim of\npromoting their wares and services to your good selves.\nSome of them will have items to give to you for FREE.\nSo turn up and get given things. Everyone's a winner,\nwouldn't you say?!\nThe handy maps contained in this pullout will\nhopefully guide you around the various areas, and help\nyou pin down the exact location of your desired clubs\nand societies. (Although most people find aimless wandering is the Freshers fair navigation method du jour.)\nAs a rough guide, the companies and businesses\nwill be mainly in the Ante Room, and the Main Dining\nHall. In the Great Hall you will find all the overseas\nsocieties. Queens Lawn is full of outdoors y sporty-type\nclubs, as well as all the motoring clubs (outside the\nMDH) and departmental societies (outside the library)\nhouses arts and entertainments clubs such as\nchoir, orchestras, drama\nand musical theatre soci-e ties, cinema etc. The\nUnion gym is jam-packed with martial arts in many different forms\nFinally, don't miss the four STAMPY STALLS to\nenter the Freshers Fair Prize Draw! Make sure you get\nthe attached Freshers Fair Pull-Out Voucher stamped by\nall of the STAMPY STALLS and return it (completely\nfilled out) to the box by the catering cashier in Da\nVinci's, in the Union Building. Loads of great p rises to\nwin. Good Luck!!\nNona Ahmet\nDeputy President Clubs and Societies\n\n"

Only the most cynical of music\nfans could resist being seduced by its melodious love-happy lyrics.\nHere at GarageCity you will meet a mixed\nbunch of people. And because the crowd at\nGarageCity is so mixed, it is impossible to feel\nout of place. However, it is clear to see that\neveryone is united by their desire to enjoy\nthemselves, like at an office party or sixth-form\ndisco. Pheromones hang heavy in the air like\ncigarette smoke or over-applied cologne,\ncharging up everyone's libido.\nCome here and you'll discover Bar Rumba\nitself is like Southside Bar with make-up on.\nThere is no cavernous main room, no DJ idol-a try, no high-tech lighting - just good music\nand unpretentious fun. So enjoy it.\nCraig Smith will be taking charge, but\nexpect residents like Bobby & Steve,\nChrissy T to be there also.\nSaturday 5th October, 10:OOpm until late\n\u00a37 before 11pm; \u00a312 after 11pm Bar Rumba, 36 Shaftesbury Avenue\nwww.zoo events. com\nNightLife\nElectric Chair Competition\nSunday @ Bridge&Tunnel\nThe monthly Electric Chair night this Sunday\nis sure to be a lot more spiritually rewarding\nthan watching Songs of Praise, with the\ndeceptively named Unabombers bringing a little bit of soulfulness to the Bridge & Tunnel.\nThe Bridge & Tunnel is one of the classiest\nof recent additions to London's bar and club\nscene. It is a hybrid of bar and club: having\nboth a stylish ground floor bar and a minimal\nbasement dance-floor. It is intelligent conversation and not high impact dancing which is\nlikely to be found here.\nThe Electric Chair night at the Bridge &\nTunnel is actually a spin-off of the\nUnabombers' own infamous Electric Chair\nnight in Manchester, which has developed a reputation for its musical diversity, featuring\nas different DJs as Mr Scruff, Fabio and\nFrancois K in its history. In fact, the\nUnabombers own sets are known through out\nthe land as being perhaps the most genre\ndefying mixed-bag of sounds that is ever likely to be heard by man, woman or child. So\nprepare yourself for what is likely to be a whole evening of surprises.\nUnabombers will be manning the decks.\nElectric Chair is every first Sunday.\nSunday 6th October, 6:00pm until late\n\u00a33 after 7:00pm Bridge & Tunnel, 4 Calvert Avenue, E2\nwww.bridge and tunnel. co.uk\nIf this first week of the year has been a little\ntoo much for you, and you simply have to get\nout this week-end, check out our competition\nbelow - it might just be what you're looking\nfor.\nFelix's Clubbing Section is giving you the\nchance to win yourself a pair of tickets, courtesy of Fabric, to Fabriclive this Friday where\nyou will get to dance to DJs such as Hybrid\nand James Lavelle. There are four pairs avail-able, the winners to be chosen at random\nfrom all of you who answer this simple question below:\nWhich London Underground station is nearest to Fabric?\nE mail your answer to clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nbefore noon on Friday 4th October for the\nopportunity of winning a pair of tickets. Please\ninclude in your e mail a contact phone num-ber, so that I can inform you if you are a win-ner. These numbers will not be recorded or\nused for any other purposes.\nDon't forget: if you love the idea of clubbing\nfor free, then join the Felix clubbing review\nteam. As a reviewer you will be offered the\nchance to go to any number of clubs in\nLondon, including all of the big names, and all\nyou have to do in return is write a decent 150\nword review of the event. This is a unique\nopportunity to go straight to the front of the\nqueue, to get in for free, and maybe even get\na V.I.P. pass and a free drink in the process.\nFor more information e mail:\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPatrick\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

This is a quick introduction to a rapid diary\nsection (normally there's a more\nstructured form for the diary in\nFelix, but not much happens in\nthe first week except extreme\nexcess, so I really couldn't be\nbothered) which will tell you\nwhere to go when, and possibly\nwhy and who with as well.\nSaturday\nWell, you are keen to go to Uni,\naren't you?

People do, I 've\nbeen told. Oh, and go and make\nfriends with someone.\nMonday\nKERRANG! Really sums up an\nemotion, don't you think. Tonight\nthe Union is having a bit of an ID\ncrisis. Do we like rock (this is\nKerrangl's only London gig this\nyear - one of the club's DJs is\nplaying), or do we like cheese?\nBoth will be playing in the Union,\nand I expect to see you all there,\nbroadening your musical horizons.\n(Late licence night)\nTuesday\nRight. Some blok e with a dog\nwho hy p not is es people (the dog\ndoes, that is). I'm not joking. He's been here before, actually, and it's a really good laugh, but the\nentrance is tickets only at the\ndoor, so get there early.\nAlternatively, if you think you're\na bit too cerebral for such sill i ness, you could go to prove your\nintellectual superiority to all your\nnew friends (but remember noone likes a smart arse) in the room\nnext door (where you don't need a ticket), because there'll be a bar\nquiz going on, where you can win\nall sorts of goodies.\nTime Out\nJust in case you hadn't noticed,\neverything I'm talking about is in\nthe Union. That's because it's Freshers' Week, and that's where\nyou should be. It's not just a blatant plug, so don't get all cynical\nand mature on me now. Have\nsome fun, for crying out loud.\nWednesday\nYay! Cheesy wot sits! This is a bar night, also with a late licence,\nthat goes on every Wednesday for\nthe rest of your life, and it's fan-tast ic.I may feel this way because\nmany of the more formative\nmoments of my life have stemmed\nfrom encounters here, but they\nmay for you too. Anyway, just go\nand get drunk. Your liver has been\nevil. It must be punished.\nThursday\nMore comedy, this time with\nDaniel Kitson, who won the\nEdinburgh Festival Award for\nExtreme Funniness. This will certainly sell out, so get in there early.\nFriday\nIt's a superhero fancy dress\nparty. This will also sell out.\nWords cannot express how cool it\nwill be. I 'll be wearing PVC.\nBy Students, For Students\nWelcome to Freshers\nFirstly I would like to welcome you to\nImperial College. You are about to enter one of\nthe best Universities in the world with some of\nthe best teaching and research to be found any-where.

That observation is\namazingly far from the truth\nhowever, because on an industrial estate in Northamptonshire,\nyou can see racing of a sort that\nwill really make your hair stand\non end. Imagine going to a circuit where you see cars dicing\nthree wide at 170 miles an hour,\nwhere the action is relentless\nand where mistakes are met by\na painful and expensive\nencounter with a concrete wall.\nThink of a place where bigger is\nmost definitely better and where\nthe noise is almost guaranteed\nto make your ears bleed.\nplenty of manic action from the\nmoment the first wheel turns in\nanger. Each race is over a fixed\ndistance of 100 miles, with a single qualifying session setting\nthe grid for the first race of the\nweekend. The finishing order of\nthe first race determines the grid\nfor the second race and so on. At\nthe start, the field is held behind\nthe pace car until the track goes\ngreen, and when it does, it\nunleashes a60 lap frenzy of\npanel-bashing, paint-swapping,\nwall-scraping, high-speed drafting and that genuine rarity in\nFormula One - overtaking.\nMandatory pit stops to take on\ntwo fresh tyres add to the spectacle and with only three\nmechanics allowed over the wall\n\u00a9 Witotda Maruszev\u00abka 2002BB Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ASCAR.\nAnglo-American Stock Car\nRacing (or ASCAR for short) is a no-holds-barred, high-octane\noval racing series loosely based\non NASCAR Winston Cup.\nAccording to the specialist\npress, it is a championship that\nis going places fast, and one\nthat is rapidly increasing in popularity among fans and drivers\nalike. It is not just a question of\nflooring the throttle pedal and\nturning left - there is far more to\nit than that, and as drivers are\nwilling to testify, ASCAR is more\nof a way of life, one that is fast\nbecoming very, very addictive.\nThe ASCAR format guarantees\ninto the hot pit lane, it always\nguarantees a certain level of\nmayhem. Plenty can go wrong\nduring an ASCAR race and\ninvariably does; this is racing\nwhere staying out of trouble is\nan art form and where the\nopportunist is king.\nUnderneath the eye-water ingly garish paint jobs, the 500 bhp\nV8-powered cars are essentially\nidentical (if somewhat agricultural in the technology depart-ment), so succeeding in ASCAR\ndepends purely on talent, balls\nand an astute racing brain.\nDriving a car at average lap\nspeeds of 155 miles an hour just\ninches away from a concrete\nwall is a real test of skill at the\nbest of times, but doing that in\nthe close company of other cars\nrequires nerves of steel along\nwith a peculiar brand of insanity.\nIt takes a special kind of person\nto compete here - this is the\nstomping ground of hard,\nuncompromising racers and\nthat is why only\nthe best will ever win\nat this particular game. ,\u2014v \u2014^\u2014 t,^N The 2002 entry brings PlM^ I1 Germany,\ntogether the very best of mmm mm The fierce competitive\nUK circuit and oval comp e^ \u00a7HMr ness and sheer un pre t it ion, with a wealth of exp e*M*d ict ability of this champi\n\u00a9 Witolda Maruszewska 2 0 0 2\non), John Mickel (2001 ASCAR\nand World Legends champion)\nand Rob Speak (2001 World Fl\nand F2 Stock Car champion).\nRally star Colin McRae and\nsportscar ace Ian McKellar Jr.\nhave also guested in the series\nalongside the\nIfc^IRSd^' regulars, which also\nincludes drivers from\nthe US, France and\nrien ce and talent from both\nsides of the divide.

In future issues there\nwill also be interviews with DJs and dance\nartists - and other insights into the world of\ndance music and clubbing. So if you've lived\nin London all your life or only the last few\nhours, NightLife is going to supply you with\njust what you need to know to go out on the\ntown and paint it any colour that you can\nthink of.\nNightLife isn't just a one-way thing.\nWhatever your taste in music, if you enjoy\ngoing out - but enjoy going out for free more\n- then get in touch with NightLife and you\ncould be joining our review team. I am especially looking for people into R&B, UK\nGarage, and Drum'n 'Bass because these have\nso far been under-represented - but anyone\nwith a love of electronic music and going out\nshould seriously consider getting involved.\nJust e mail me at clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk to find\nout more.\nAlso, if you know of any club or event that\nyou think needs to be covered in NightLife,\ngive me a shout at clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk and I will try to make sure that it does not go unnoticed.

The prospect of John\nDigweed, Phil Thompson and a \"Very Special\nGuest\" in the main room seems too good to\nmiss, but with Soma Records taking over the\nStar Bar, you will also get for your money\nStuart Mcmillan & Orde Meikle (Slam) tearing\nup the dancefloor.\nEach month Bedrock promises talented DJs\nplaying the very best of house, sleek visuals\nand a great atmosphere - and delivers every\ntime. But perhaps one of Bedrock's best features is its enthusiastic, lively crowd. It is difficult not to get swept along when a tidal wave\nof cheers and hands in the air moves back\nthrough the audience when a crescendo is\nreached or the bass kicks in.\nHeaven is perhaps one of London's most\nfriendly clubs, with its well-lit bars, its intimate\nalcoves and lack of attitude. Bedrock and\nHeaven make a great team.\nFor your own sake: forget those Friday morning lectures and instead make time for this\nmid-week extravaganza.\nJohn Digweed, Phil Thompson, Stuart\nMcmillan and Orde Meikle (Slam) and one\nVery Special Guest.\nThursday 3rd October, 9:00pm3:00 am \u00a36 NUS /\u00a38 others before 11pm; more after 11pm Heaven, The Arches, Villiers Street, WC2\nwww.bedrock.org.uk\nFabriclive\nFriday @ Fabric\nFor the uninitiated, Fabric is considered by\nmany to be London's best club: everything\nfrom the neon-lit descent into the club to its\ninnovative cutting-edge sound system has\nhelped to make it a living legend of club land. Fabriclive, Fabric's Friday night event, really\nworks hard to give you an experience unparalleled by any other major club in London. From\nthe live performances by established and\nsoon-to-be-big electronica acts to the verbal\nmayhem of the MCs in room two, it goes\nbeyond simply offering you a line-up of\nfamous DJs.\nTestament to its abilities, Fabriclive can\nhost between its room one and two such\ndiverse sounds as quirky electro and hard-edged drum'n 'bass simultaneously without it\nseeming like a bad segue.\nBest of all, for a club which could have the\nmost famous DJs in the world play there if\nthey wanted, Fabric and Fabriclive avoid this\nobvious route. Instead they give their decks\nover to highly respected artists like Jacques\nLu Cont and the Propellerheads, which guarantees to give you a unique Friday night out.\nHybrid, James Lavelle, Stanton Warriors,\nFabio, Peshay, Krust, 4 Hero (DJ set), and\nDub Pistols among many.\nFriday 4th October, 9.30pm5.00 am \u00a312 (\u00a310 NUS)\nFabric, 77A Charterhouse Street, EC1\nwww.fabric london. com\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk Become a Felix reviewer to have your say on all the latest entertainment\n\n"

    "content": "1 V^!i COLUMN Editorial\nFELIX Hi De Ho, campers. I am here so\nwe can usher in the new term\ntogether, as old friends, and hopefully as new.\nI hope you are all fully rested\nafter your lovely summer holidays.\nYou should rest happy in the\nknowledge that I am now significantly more tired than when the\nholidays started out, and not in a good way, let me tell you.\nFor those of you who don't know, I'm Will, and I edit this here\nnewspaper. Although officially still\na student, I graduated in July\n2001, and since then I have been\nworking on this. Not this issue,\nobviously, but Felix itself.\nYou should also, perhaps, be\nwarned that I am prone to revealing fairly personal issues in this\ncolumn, so if you are easily\noffended, then look away now.\nUntil the end of the year.\nBut all this aside, I can write, as\nyou can tell from my excellent use\nof a conjunction at the beginning\nof a paragraph, reasonably well,\nas well I should, given the amount\nof practice I 've had over the year.\nHowever, I do not like it, because\nI believe that Felix should be written by you lot, since it's you that\nread it. Therefore I'm asking anyone who's interested to come\nalong and see us at Freshers Fair,\nor just come down to the office in\nthe West Wing basements of Beit\nQuad, and you can help out completely at will. And this is because\nwe're special here. There are no\nmembers to this club. Every other\nclub you have to join, and give\nmoney to, but not this one. 'Write\nwhen you like, edit when you like,\ncome and go as you like, and\nspend a fair amount of time in the\nbar if you like (researching stories,\nobviously)'. That was our motto,\nby the way. It's more catchy in\nLatin, no really - 'In vino Veritas'.\nSo yeah, it's nice to see you all\nback here already. It seems like\nonly yesterday that all my friends\nleft, leaving me here languishing\nin my basement, but you'll all be\npleased to know that I have fully\nsucceeded in having several mental breakdowns over the year, but\nI still manage to avoid becoming\naddicted to psychotropic drugs.\nSorry - this is a reference to something I wrote at the beginning of\nlast year (and I can assure you I am the only person that remembers), where I considered past editors and their mental healths having completed this job for a year. I am pleased to say that I am the\nmost sane one, in my opinion.\nWhich obviously goes to show\nhow little work I must do.\nSo, to bring some of you up to\nscratch. The cat's name is\nBridget, and while the more astute\nof you may recognise her from last\nyear, you have to agree she's had\na bit of a make-over. In case\nyou're interested 'Felix' is her middle name. Yes, boys and girls, this\nis the whole new-look Felix that's had the Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen\ntreatment and everything. And I must say she looks fantastic\n(thanks Al). So yes. Only a few\nmore hours until my deadline is\nreally, truly upon me, and in that\ntime all I have to do is write a few\nnews stories. But why am I writing\nthem, when you could do a so\nmuch better job? I don't know...\nmaybe you're too lazy or busy during Freshers Week.\nAll those of you who are fans of\nmy more interesting tales of woe\nand broken dreams may be sad to\nhear that at the moment I'm feeling relatively stable, but there are\na few surprises in store for me\nnext year, I'm sure, so do not fear:\nmental trauma will not be long in\ncoming. And for the rest of you\nwho like a bit of political commentary in your editorials, then let\nme just say that the current economic climate does not lend itself\nto the usual form of self-satisfied\nself-grandiose ment to which you\nmay well be accustomed.\nAnd on that note, my good\nfriends, Adios. Or should that be\nAu re voir? I don't know.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The day guardsman the security\nlodges in departments, as well as in Southside land the familiar lodge in Beit Quad where access to club and society facilities is managed. They also take care of departmental post.\nIn a memo sent during July by Keith Reynolds, Head of Security, Post and Fire services, it was announced that the sixteen day guard posts vo ul dbe replaced with sixteen patrolling posts,\nin order to provide \"effective patrol and response duties\". These new patrolling posts were to have different hours and rates of pay, and while the day guards were eligible to apply for the new positions, there was no guarantee that their jobs were secure. Redundancy was the likely alternative for those guards not given a patrolling job.\nDay guards not the only officers to disappear?\nOn1 st August, the situation further escalated when all Security Officers were warned that their\nterms of employment were to be reviewed. Meanwhile, some of the day guards previously threatened had sought alternative employment or had even planned to take the improved dancy package offered to them the prev month. The situation changed once again on September when it emerged that Con ferenc would fund fifteen Campus Receptionist job with an additional managerial role - h app matching the sixteen day guard positions\nwere originally to be lost. With the new emer would come new terms, but Keith Rey told Felix that they would be \"very, very sim\nto current hours and pay. Unfortunately, those planning to leave w the improved redundancy package, either\nretirement or other employment, no longer h that option, although some are still plan n in leave for health reasons, according to Mr Reynolds. Every departmental head contacted by F vehemently refused' to comment, but it is c that there is consternation in College about sri ty arrangements for the future. AW\nNUS by the Back Door\nThe National Union of Students seems to have crept into Imperial College despite an overwhelming rejection of theN US by Imperial students last year. The new Union card for the200203 session is\nsponsored by End sleigh Insurance, who are partly\nowned by the NUS, and bizarrely market ted as the only student insurers recommended by the body. As such,\nthey include theN US logo on their marketing material and the back of our Union card is no exception.\nThe result is that, although Imperial College Union is\nin noway affiliated with theN US after students voted72% against joining (\nprobably on the grounds that beer prices may have gone up), our Union card features an NUS online logo.\nIt is unclear whether stores accepting only NUS cards for discounts will betaken in, but David Francis,\nhead of the 'Yes' campaign last year, was clearly\namused. Imperial Union President Sen Ganesh added that the presence of the offending acronym had been\" unexpected\" but that the use of the Union cards would go ahead as planned. AW\nThe Union President welcomes\nyou to Imperial College, and\ninvites you to get involved in\nrunning the place.\nFreshers Week Diary, so at least\nyou know where you can get\nthat all-important drink.\nVintage cryptic crossword,\nwhich should give you something to do while queuing.\nFour clubs reviewed for the first\nweek of term, and a competition to win tickets to Fabric!\n\"Welcome to the first day of the rest of our... term?\" http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/felix/ * felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SECTION \u00a9 Wilolda Maruszewska 2002\ndifferent teams. Races are closely fought as a whole, but regulars to the series will not easily\nforget the sight of Jason Plato\nputting Stevie Hodgson on the\ngrass at over 170 mph or the\nrepeated and frequent clashes\nbetween Colin White and\nNicolas Minassian. Many of the\nother drivers and some of the\nteam managers have also added\nspice to the regular bouts of controversy - particularly in the sea-son-long needle match between\nthe circuit racers and the oval\nboys.\nEverything about ASCAR and\nits support package of Legends\nand Pick-ups is geared towards\nthe fans, and the whole atmosphere of a race weekend is\nfriendly and welcoming without\nthe bustle and im personality of a major meeting. In only its first\nfull season of competition, it is\nstill a voyage of discovery for the\norganisers, technical crew and\nthe teams, but they appear to\nhave the balance right, from the\nintense and extremely close racing to the approach ability of\nteam personnel; drivers are\nSpeedway in Germany.\nRockingham is just outside\nCorby so there is absolutely no\nexcuse in saying its too far away\nor hard to get to. The facilities\nare top notch and really puts\nplaces like Silverstone and\nBrands Hatch to shame. The\nRock is also the only circuit in\nthe UK where you can watch the\nracing from the roof of the pits\ngarages - well worth a visit for\nthat alone. Aside from ASCAR,\nRockingham also plays host to\nthe only European round of the\nFedEx CART championship as\nwell as other top-class national\nrace meetings.\n| \u00a9 Wto SSS Sze wsR o02l For the most part, the racing\nhad been hard but fair and with\njust two races left to run, there\nare still four drivers capable of\nwinning the championship and\ntaking the Mintex Cup away with\nthem at the end of the year. The\nbattling quartet of Kelvin Burt,\nColin White, Nicolas Minassian\na nd Jason Plato are seperated\nha paltry 59 points, and with\n1 7\n5 available for a win (not\nhunting bonuses), anything can\nst\n-ill happen and most probably\nMl ASCAR is like that.\ng felix@jc.ac.uk\nmore than happy to pose for\nphotos and to sign autographs\nwhile mechanics delight in providing fans of all ages with used\ntyres to take home as souvenirs.\nRockingham Motor Speedway,\nknown by regular race goers as\nThe Rock, is the spiritual home\nof ASCAR - built on the site of a former steelworks, it is the UK's newest circuit and only purpose-built oval. All but four of the\nMintex Cup races are contested\nhere, with the remainder being\nrun at the Lausitz Euro\nboth days. If you do decide to go\nalong and see for yourself, you\ncan be sure that the good 'ol\nboys of ASCAR will put on a show that won't disappoint. Get\nreal - who needs Formula One\nwhen you can have racing that's this good?\nMore photographs from this\nseason's ASCAR meetings at\nRockingham can be found at\nwww.thru x to n.f9. co.uk/gallery-circuit.htm. For further information on ASCAR and the\nRockingham Motor Speedway,\nvisit www.as car. co.uk and\nwww.rockingham.co.uk.\nThanks go to Jeff Carter and\n\u00a9 Witolda Maaiszewska 2002\nThere is still time to sample\nthe ASCAR experience this year,\nwith the final two races that will\ndecide the championship taking\nplace on the weekend of the 5th and 6th of October. For those\ninterested in going to\nRockingham, a car pass for the\npractice and qualifying on the\nSaturday costs \u00a35 and a ticket\nfor Sunday's races is \u00a315.\nAccess to the paddock is free on\nJonathan Clark for their time\nand co-operation in producing\nthis feature. Additional special\nmentions must go to Kelvin Burt\nfor giving up some of his time in\norder to give me a good insight\non ASCAR from a driver's perspective and to the RML and\nBintcliffe Sport crews for their\nnews, views and comments\nthroughout the season.\nWitolda Maruszewska\n\u00a9 Witolda Maruszewska:\nto.\n~'WKF\u00a5 ~ HT\"\"\ns The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

As he dived away to\nmy right I headed for the cloud\ndead ahead - a white, fluffy, well-developed cumulus cloud, it\nlooked like it could be marking a strong thermal. As I passed under\nthe sunlight side of the cloud, I felt the right wing of the glider\nbeing forced upwards. I pulled up\nand turned hard right to stay in\nthe lift. Glancing at the instruments, and adjusting the radius\nof my turn, I soon found myself in\nthe core of the thermal. The\naltimeter needle began to wind\nround the dial... 2000'...2100'...\n2300'. Five minutes later, at\n4000', the climb eventually\npetered out. I was now flying level\nwith the cloud base, staring\nstraight down at the airfield I launched from; now a tiny green\nstrip between the trees.\nWell, the weather wasn't quite\nthat good every day, but many\nmembers of Imperial College\nGliding Club (i cGC) had similar\nexperiences during our recent\nfour-week summer expedition to\nthe Black Forest, Germany. Last\nyear's expedition took us to the\nSpanish Pyrenees, while an expedition to the Czech Republic is on\nthe cards for 2003. i cGC is the\nlongest established and best\nequipped gliding club in the UK,\nwith a fleet of gliders consisting of\na two-seat training glider and two\nhigh performance single seater\ngliders. Union subsidy means that\ni cGC is without a doubt the\ncheapest and most accessible\nopportunity to learn to fly avail-able. And if you're not sure if it's for you, why not take a no obligation trial flight for just \u00a325.\nFinally, several of the pilots\nwho participated in this year's expedition took up gliding only\nlast autumn, so if you start training now, you could be joining us\nnext summer...\nFor more information, contact\nme at a jb@ glider pilot. net, visit\nour stand at the Freshers' Fair on\nQueen's Lawn (where you can't miss us) or come to one of our\nweekly meetings in Aeronautics\nRoom 266, 12.30-13.15 on\nFridays.\nAlan Bamford\nLive football\nFrom\nimperial\ncollege\nunion\nBARS\nSol 28th Sept\n12pm Leeds v Arsenal\n8.30pm ft. ft et is v ft arca Sun 29th Sept\n4pm Palace v Gillingham\n7.30pm Valencia vR.

Reality exists as an objective absolute \u2014 facts are facts, independent\nof man's feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.\n2. Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material\nprovided by man's senses) is man's only means of perceiving reality,\nhis only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic\nmeans of survival.\n3. Man \u2014 every man \u2014 is an end in himself, not the means to the ends\nof others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to\nothers nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational\nself-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of\nhis life.\n4. The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and\nexecutioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free,\nvoluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may\nobtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no\nman may initiate the use of physical force against others. The\ngovernment acts only as a policeman that protects man's rights; it uses\nphysical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its\nuse, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full\ncapitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for\nthe same reasons as the separation of state and church.\nNovelist-Philosopher Ayn Rand\nThe United Kingdom Objectivist Association, P.O.
