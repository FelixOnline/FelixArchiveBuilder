    "content": "18\nCOMMENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 15 OCTOBER 2010\nT\nhe Browne review into\nhigher education funding\nand student finance has\nrecommended not only a\ndoubling of tuition fees, but\nmade provisions for a free market in tuition fees.\nSuch extreme proposals had looked\nincreasingly likely as leaks built up over\nthe last few weeks \u2013 but, in many ways,\nthis was always the likely outcome of a\nreview led by the former chief executive\nof BP, with the rest of the panel made up\nof three business people, two vice chancellors and a university employee.\nThe question now turns to how the\nGovernment will respond to the review\u2019s findings. The make-up of the\nGovernment should be in our favour\n\u2013 the Liberal Democrat party have a\nlong-stated belief that tuition fees are\nregressive and unfair, and have indeed\nargued that fees should be entirely abol-ished. Moreover, every single Liberal\nDemocrat MP signed an NUS pledge\nprior to the election to vote against any\nrise in tuition fees. It will not be possible to get a rise in the tuition fee cap\npassed through parliament if the Liberal\nDemocrats stick to this pledge \u2013 and so\nall eyes will be on them over the coming\nweeks and months.\nWe will not accept any MPs breaking the pledge that they made to students\nand their families during the election\ncampaign \u2013 you simply can\u2019t say one\nthing one month, only to do the exact\nopposite once you are in power.\nBut we must also strongly make the\ncase against any rise in tuition fees to\nall MPs \u2013 they are a regressive model\nwhich, as Secretary of State Vince Cable argued this summer, act as a higher\neducation \u201cpoll tax\u201d. Higher fees would\nclearly be far worse still, leaving graduates with crippling levels of debt and\nundoubtedly deterring applicants from\npoorer backgrounds.\nPoliticians will argue that tuition\nfees have to rise given the massive cuts\nthe higher education sector will suffer.\nThis is completely unacceptable \u2013 why\nshould students be forced to take on yet\nmore debt simply to lessen the damage\nof expected government cuts? Students\ndid not cause the recession \u2013 it is simply\nnot fair to ask them to pay for the mistakes of others.\nWhat is more, universities made no\ncase as to how they would use higher\ntuition fees to improve the student ex-perience, let alone accounted for the\nReject higher fees\nextra income they have received from\nstudents\u2019 pockets since fees were tripled\njust four years ago. Student satisfaction\nhas not improved at all in that period.\nVice chancellors, on an average salary \u00a3219,000, must be disabused of the\nnotion that students and their families\nwould tolerate paying more for less,\nor indeed to foot the bill for others\u2019\nexcesses.\nThe Coalition Government has a\ngolden opportunity to implement a fair-er, more sustainable alternative to higher\ntuition fees. If they fail to do so, students\nand their families, already feeling the\npinch, will not forgive or forget.\n\u2018Crippling\u2019levels of debt are not the way forward for a\nsustainable higher education system\nThe ailments that afflict UK universities\nare well documented. A rapid increase in\nthe number of students wishing to go to\nuniversity, combined with declining government funding has left our higher education\ninstitutions short of cash and a generation\nof young people denied the opportunity to\nstudy at a higher level.\nThe argument about who should fund universities has been long settled. We have\nall agreed that, as it is the individual who\nbenefits from a university education, the\nindividual should also pay for it. Conflating\nBrowne\u2019s recommendations with the need to\ncut the deficit ignores the vital truth that the\ncurrent debate is all about the need to push\nthe financial burden onto the individual.\nSo, a graduate tax or unlimited fees?\nBrowne\u2019s recommendations are a welcome\ncompromise between the two. They assuage the fears of students like those at\nImperial who are worried that a graduate\ntax would unfairly penalise them for being\nhigh-achievers. And ideas like raising the\nlevel at which graduates begin paying off\ntheir debts, encouraging universities to give\nmore bursaries and a lower rate of interest\nfor low-earning graduates also ensure that\nstudents from poorer backgrounds are not\nput off.\nBut ultimately, any debate about university\nfunding comes down to one word: debt. Obviously higher tuition fees will result in much\nlarger graduate debt but the difference\nbetween this and other funding models is\nsimply a matter of perception. Consider the\namount that you would pay through a graduate tax as a lump sum and suddenly you\nhave a mountain of student debt; converse-ly, think of your tuition fee debt as a monthly\ndeduction to your salary and doesn\u2019t it suddenly feel like you\u2019re being taxed? Although\nyour student debt may take some time to\npay off, it is the friendliest debt you will ever\nincur.\nThe benefits derived from a university education (both financial and personal) are sub-stantial. The need for direct and increased\nuniversity funding is urgent. And the realistic impact of substantial student debt is far\nless than some would like to portray. Given\nthese three truths, the Browne Review\u2019s recommendations are useful, thorough and the\nideal medicine for our ailing higher education system.\nFELIX\nAaron Porter\n\u201c \u201d\nStudents did not cause the\nrecession \u2013 it is simply not\nfair to ask them to pay for the\nmistakes of others.\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nImperial students should\nsupport the Browne\nReview\u2019s recommendations\nEvery Lib Dem MP promised at the election to vote against an increase in tuition fees\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPresident, National\nUnion of Students\n\u201cWe will not accept\nany MPs breaking the\npledge they made\u201d\n\n"

This was a considerable\nblow for First Quantum, which spent\nUS$750m developing the mine, a move\nthat generated over a quarter of the company\u2019s US$3bn profits in 2008.\nThe Congolese government cited First\nQuantum\u2019s \u201cunreasonable unwillingness\nto renegotiate\u201d the amount of taxes they\nwould have to pay once the mine had\nbeen made operational as the reason. In\nearly August, the government proceeded\nin a highly controversial move to sell\n50.5% of the mine for US$175m to Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.\nENRC is one of Kazakhstan\u2019s largest\ncompanies, but is listed on the London\nStock exchange, has full access to global\nfinancial markets and employs several\nhigh-profile directors. These include the\nformer Rector of Imperial College, Sir\nRichard Sykes, who is the company\u2019s\nSenior Independent Director.\nComplaints against Sir Richard were\nfirst raised by Standard Life, which owns\n0.4 per cent of ENRC. They claimed that\nthe former Imperial College Rector had\nshown bad judgement in buying the\nrights, given that the mine is still subject\nto a dispute between the Congolese government and First Quantum.\nSir Richard, who also serves in a number of philanthropic and business roles\noutside of ENRC, defended his actions\nlast month, telling the Telegraph that: \u201cIt\nis an issue between First Quantum and\nthe DRC government. First Quantum\nwere given every opportunity to renegotiate their contract with the DRC. They\ndidn\u2019t and it was taken off them.\u201d Sir\nRichard added that his company went to\nconsiderable effort to ensure there were\n\u201cno dodgy dealings.\u201d\nFirst Quantum is now accusing the\ncompany of buying stolen property that\nbelongs to it and has sued ENRC in the\nInternational Court of Arbitration. Congo has already promised to respect the\ncourt\u2019s decision. The lawsuit demands\nUS$2.5bn, which Newall said was the\n\u201ccalculated market damage done to First\nQuantum and against our peer group.\u201d\nIn response to the Congolese government\u2019s claims of unspecified misconduct by First Quantum, Newall said that\n\u201cthey are making weightless and scurrilous accusations against the manage-The much fought-over Kolwezi mine generates a substantial part of the Congo\u2019s total government income\n\u201cThe Congolese government\ngave the reason for this termination as First Quantum\u2019s\n\u2018unreasonable unwillingness to\nrenegotiate\u2019 the amount of taxes\nthey would have to pay\u201d\nTwo miners rumble\nin the Congo\nKazakhstan\u2019s largest miner battles Canadian rival over\nproperty rights in a war-torn and impoverished region\nSina Ataherian\nRead this article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nNews Summary\nLiverpool owners lose court case\nThe High Court ruled on Wednesday against Liverpool\nFC owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett attempting\nto sack the club\u2019s Board of Directors.\nThe pair had been trying to prevent a sale of the\nclub. Justice Floyd told the pack court that this am-mounted to \u201cthe clearest possible breach\u201d of corporate governance rules. The ruling brings the club\ncloser to a takeover by either the American owners\nof the Boston Red Sox or a Singaporean billionaire.\nMixed signals on UK employment\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the\nUK claimant count rose by 5,300 last month, the\nbiggest rise since January. August\u2019s increase was\nrevised up to 3,800. These figures are still far better than recent US employment data, in relative\nterms.\nHowever, the International Labour Organistation,\nwhich measures unemployment in broader terms,\nreported a fall by 20,000 to 2.448 million in the\nthree months to August. That took the jobless rate\ndown to 7.7 percent from 7.8 percent, the lowest\nsince May 2009.\nThis was mostly due to a rise in part-time workers,\nand did little to calm market fears about expected\njob losses accross the public sector.\nGoogle plans inflation index\nComplaints about the inaccuracy of government inflation numbers, and their inconsistency with the\ndaily experience of buying and selling, are as old as\nthe statistics themselves.\nThese numbers are currently collected by hand from\narbitarily selected stores. They can be a month old\nbefore release and the product weightings used are\ntypically much older still.\nThis week Google announced its own inflation index,\nbased on, and weighted by, daily data from online\nsales prices and volumes. No decision has yet been\nmade about whether to publish it.\nWriting for Felix\nFelix Business is looking for new contributors this\nyear.

    "content": "Imperial College Mens 1st XV began their\ntitle seeking season with an impressive victory over RUMS at Harlington. A draw against\nthe same opposition at Harlington last season\ncost Imperial promotion and the division title\nand the team were egar to avoid another below\npar result this time around. The victory followed on from the successful summer tour to\nJapan and an intense pre-season programme\nin which some of the squad made appearances\nfor the London Nigerian side. The team was\npredominately comprised of experienced university players although four first years started\nin Caolan Cotter\u2019s first competitive match as\ncaptain.\nNick Johnson took over kicking duties from\nhis now graduated brother and duly slotted the\nfirst points of the match within the first ten min-utes. RUMS were able to draw level due to Imperial\u2019s ill discipline at the breakdown resulting\nafter big covering tackles from Cotter and lock\nCharlie Esberger. This was to be where tit for\ntat points scoring ended as Imperial asserted\ntheir dominant hold over the game. The front\nfive were hitting rucks effectively without being needlessly sucked in which allowed hair-band-ed scrum-half Graham Riddler to produce\nquick ball for the back line with Louie Barnet\nand full back Max Joachim combining well\ndown the left wing. Ben Adubi, making his first\nappearance for Imperial, produced some evasive and hard hitting lines and was rewarded\nwith the first of his two tries halfway through\nthe first half after Johnson had kicked another\npenalty. First year biomedical science student\nTom Stone added another try before half time,\nallowing the team to go into the break in a comfortable position.\nIn an act reminiscent of the supposed halftime meeting between Frank Rijkaard and\nAnders Frisk in 2005, Imperial coach Richard\nBirkett sought the referee to remind him of the\nnewly enforced rules relating to the tackle area.\nUnsurprisingly, within the first minute of the\nsecond half, Imperial were awarded a penalty\nwhen RUMS tacklers didn\u2019t release the Chris\nMcGeough before attempting to steal possession from him. David Bowe provided decent\nfield position with his kicking from hand and\nImperial began to impose themselves upon\ntheir opposition who were struggling in the\nscrum with debutante prop, Simon Fenton,\nproving to be a natural in his new position.\nAlthough Birkett rang the changes mid way\nthrough the second half, the energy and work\nrate did not suffer as Imperial ran in a further\nthree tries courtesy of Cotter, Adubi and replacement centre Adam Foley.\nThis was a promising and commanding\nperformance from the whole team who will\nbe looking to push on and remain unbeaten\nthroughout the season.\n42 felix\nFRIDAY 15 OCTOBER 2010\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSports Editors: Jovan Nedic & David Wilson\nFelix Sports League\nsponsored by\nTeam P W D L F A Diff Index\n1 Volleyball M1 10 10 0 0 20 1 19 5.00\n2 Fencing W1 10 10 0 0 1338 863 475 5.00\n3 ICSM Rugby M1 14 12 1 1 512 159 353 4.14\n4 Volleyball W1 9 8 0 1 17 4 13 4.00\n5 Rugby M1 14 11 2 1 470 88 382 3.93\n6 Lacrosse W1 8 7 0 1 145 21 124 3.88\n7 Squash M3 7 6 0 1 15 6 9 3.71\n8 ICSM Badminton M1 9 7 1 1 55 17 38 3.67\n9 Netball W2 9 7 1 1 308 184 124 3.67\n10 ICSM Netball W2 10 7 2 1 421 290 131 3.50\n11 Table Tennis M1 11 9 0 2 130 57 73 3.36\n12 Badminton M1 11 8 1 2 54 34 20 3.09\n13 Squash W1 11 6 4 1 30 14 16 3.09\n14 Lacrosse M1 8 5 1 2 73 54 19 2.38\n15 Fencing M1 10 7 0 3 1247 1022 225 2.30\n16 Hockey W1 11 7 1 3 51 14 37 2.27\n17 ICSM Hockey M1 11 7 1 3 39 23 16 2.27\n18 Squash M1 9 6 0 3 27 18 9 2.00\n19 Badminton M2 11 6 1 4 53 35 18 1.45\n20 Football M1 11 6 1 4 32 26 6 1.45\n21 ICSM Netball W1 10 6 0 4 378 314 64 1.40\n22 Tennis M1 12 5 3 4 70 49 21 1.25\n23 Tennis M2 9 5 0 4 46 44 2 1.00\n24 Squash M4 9 5 0 4 15 12 3 1.00\n25 Hockey M2 9 3 3 3 19 19 0 1.00\n26 Netball W1 11 6 0 5 450 393 57 0.91\n27 Football M3 7 3 1 3 8 18 -10 0.71\n28 Basketball M1 8 4 0 4 500 509 -9 0.50\n29 Fencing W2 10 5 0 5 1052 1235 -183 0.50\n30 ICSM Hockey W2 10 3 3 4 11 29 -18 0.50\n31 Badminton W1 10 3 3 4 43 37 6 0.50\n32 Hockey W2 10 4 1 5 20 29 -9 0.20\n33 ICSM Hockey M3 8 3 1 4 15 29 -14 0.13\n34 ICSM Hockey W1 9 4 0 5 28 23 5 0.00\n35 Squash M2 9 4 0 5 18 27 -9 0.00\n36 Fencing M3 10 4 0 6 1054 1163 -109 -0.40\n37 ICSM Football M1 7 2 1 4 9 14 -5 -0.57\n38 Rugby Union M2 12 4 0 8 222 167 55 -1.00\n39 Football M2 12 4 0 8 20 30 -10 -1.00\n40 Netball W3 9 3 0 6 189 281 -92 -1.00\n41 Tennis W1 11 2 2 7 35 75 -40 -1.27\n42 Rugby M3 10 2 1 7 103 258 -155 -1.60\n43 Rugby Union M4 9 2 0 7 79 220 -141 -2.00\n44 ICSM Netball W3 8 1 1 6 193 282 -89 -2.13\n45 Hockey M1 9 1 1 7 17 31 -14 -2.33\n46 ICSM Rugby M2 12 2 0 10 181 371 -190 -2.50\n47 ICSM Hockey M2 8 0 2 6 8 34 -26 -2.50\n48 ICSM Rugby M3 12 1 0 11 122 385 -263 -3.25\n49 ICSM Football M2 8 0 1 7 6 36 -30 -3.25\n50 Football W1 8 0 1 7 2 52 -50 -3.25\n51 ICSM Hockey W3 8 0 1 7 7 66 -59 -3.25\n52 ICSM Football M2 7 0 0 7 5 35 -30 -4.00\nWelcome to the Felix Sports League, now in its fourth\nyear and going from strength to strength.

Last week we went there to che\nThe Finborough Theatre occupies a small room\nabove a Kensington pub (The Finborough) and\nseems the most unlikely place to put on a large\ncast musical by the great Broadway duo Rodgers and Hammerstein. Now I\u2019m a massive fan\nof the intimate theatre but a broadway musical?\nAll I can say is that \u201cMe and Juliet\u201d triumphed\nin it and in fact only a few minutes into the\nshow the size of the place completely left my\nmind; quite a tricky but vital thing to achieve\nwhen putting on such a show.\nThe only thing that unsuspended my disbelief\nif you will, was the large, sweaty bloke who\ndecided to sit next to me and provide an unpleasant olfactory reminder of our proximity. A\ncombination of enveloping myself in the drama\nand breathing through my mouth allowed me to\nenjoy the night regardless.\nThe play is set with a touring musical company performing a show, also rather confusingly\ncalled \u201cMe and Juliet\u201d. The characters consist\nof the chorus girl and her brutish stagehand\nboyfriend, the Assistant Stage Manager who\nquietly swoons and several other colourful theatre types, including the massive luvvy lead ac-tor, all with hilarious \u2018New Yoik\u201d accents. The\ngirl goes for the quiet, sensitive stage manager\nand the nasty crew-member swears to kill him.\nBut of course!\nThe play within the play is a brilliant take-off\nof the tailcoats and canes, tophats and charleston musicals of the 30s and 40s. If you\u2019d seen\nany such musicals, then you could not help but\nlaugh out loud at the ridiculous grins and over\nthe top ah-ah-ah-ing The company really pulled\nthe laughs out of these chorus numbers considering they were written with 47 cast members\nin mind and they were only 11.\nThe company as a whole was excellent\nthough there were one or two personal performances that brought it down. The stagehand\nboyfriend wasn\u2019t nearly enough of a psycho\ndickwad to convince me that he would actually\ndo harm to the loved-up stage manager. To be\nhonest I\u2019ve heard 12 year old children say \u201cI\u2019ll\nkill you!\u201d more convincingly than he did. So he\nwas a bit wooden and one other character\u2019s accent seemed to sway between New Yorker and\nScottish but apart from that it was an all-round\nfun and clever show, brought to life in a challenging venue.\nMy parting message to you would be: don\u2019t\nthink that London theatre is confined to the\nWest End. There are dozens of \u201cpub theatres\u201d\nlike the Finborough that offer great theatre in\ninteresting venues with very fine performanc-es. So break the mould, look in the nooks and\ncrannies, you will most likely be pleasantly\nsurprised.\nNigel Fullerton\nLook in the nooks and crannies with this actor and you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\nImperial does The Ugly One\nBeauty does not bring true happiness. Marius\nvon Mayenburg\u2019s \u201cThe Ugly One\u201d, produced\nby the IC Drama Society, discusses this theme\nin a comedic and slightly ridiculous approach\nwhilst never letting us forget the tragedy of trying to conform to social norms.\nLette is a man who finds out that he is incredibly ugly and reacts by having his face\nsurgically remodelled. We watch his ascent to\nattractiveness and power before the surgeon\u2019s\nactions become his undoing.\nA cast of only four actors play the eight\ncharacters and the scenes are made to shift\nseamlessly into one another. At times, the actors transform from character to character with\nbarely a moment\u2019s pause. The flawlessness of\nthese complicated scene changes was a credit\nto the direction; the constant shifts kept my attention continually on the action.\nLuke Daley, Shamini Bundell and Phil Raymond were good in their respective parts, with\nRaymond providing some excellent comic\nrelief as the gay son of a very sexually active seventy-year-old woman. However, Tosin\nAjayi, who played the very similar characters\nof Lette\u2019s surgeon and boss, outshone the rest\nof the cast. Ajayi\u2019s nuanced performance gave\neach character a true and distinct personality\neven though both characters were not only fundamentally the same persona, but also followed\nsimilar storylines.\nI attended a rehearsal of \u201cThe Ugly One\u201d with\nno lighting effects, performed in the middle of\na simple meeting room. Although the extra effects in performance will undoubtedly improve\nthe fluidity of the scene changes, I enjoyed\nwatching the raw talent of the actors.\nAlthough \u201cThe Ugly One\u201d was essentially\nabout the power of beauty in our society and\nthe true uniqueness of inner beauty, they were\nat times trying to convey too many messages.\nEverything from domineering mothers to doc-tor-patient relationships were there so although\nthe play was a wonderful showcase of the acting talent at Imperial, it left me slightly confused as to the playwright\u2019s overall intended\nmessage.\nFriday 15th/Saturday 16th.\nin the Union Concert Hall.\nTickets \u00a34 (\u00a32 for students)\nAs another winter fast approaches, so too does another instalment of the never ending Harry Potter\nseries. Inevitably, reviews will swoon at how wonderfully dark the films have become, how fantastically magical Hogwarts is, and how brilliantly the\nannoying brats seize the day. And yet all I feel when\nI see this wizard boy with silly specs and about as\nmuch acting talent as a giraffe-impersonating lion\non stilts is a nostalgic yearning for the days when I\nfirst picked up a Roald Dahl book.\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Twits,\nGeorge\u2019s Marvellous Medicine, Matilda, The Witches.\nEach and every one of these books has its own brilliant array of grotesque adults and rotten children.\nVoldemort could learn a thing or two from the Grand\nHigh Witch and Miss Trunchbull. The black comedy\nis simply mesmerising. It\u2019s no surprise that Tim\nBurton felt compelled to delve into the disturbing\nworld of Willy Wonka. Dahl\u2019s books are to Harry Potter what Dracula is to Twilight.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nCharles Betts tells us about his\nfavourite author and just about\npicks his favourite book\nTales of the\nUnexpected by\nRoald Dahl\nWhich book do you love more than any other? Tell\nus why it\u2019s so good - Send 300 to 400 words to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBut arguably Dahl\u2019s most compelling work is reserved for adults, an audience for which he holds\nno reigns on his macabre and wry sense of humour.\nTales of the Unexpected is a literary gem, a sublime\ncollection of 16 sinister short stories with a gripping dearth of morality. Whether it\u2019s the traveller\nwho throws himself overboard on a cruise liner\nso as to win a bet or the harmless and mild mannered landlady whose guests stay for longer than\nexpected, each tale comes with its own concoction\nof comedy and horror, and its own startling twist.\nDahl\u2019s books are all classics and have been read\nby children and adults for over fifty years. They are\nall page-turners, all simultaneously enchanting,\nshocking, compelling, and vile. To pick a favourite\nis like asking Silvio Berlusconi to pick his pet mis-tress. It can be done, but not easily. Tales of the\nUnexpected is my pick of the bunch.\nEva Rosenthal Mena\n\u201cPhil Raymond was very\ngood, providing some\nexcellent comic relief\nas the gay son of a very\nsexually active seventy-year-old woman\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX Friday 15 October 2010 17\nMajid Al-Khalil\nSadly no simple single solution\nIn September 2010 members of the IC Palestinian Society travelled in the West Bank\nand took part in voluntary programs at Al-Najah University and Askar refugee camp\nwithout representing the Palestinians of\n1948 but also without representing the\nPalestinians of the Gaza siege. He is not\nsaying anything about the refugees. It is\nnot just a matter of \u201848. But why now to\nstress the idea of two states? Because we\nmust end occupation and I don\u2019t want to\nenter into this route of two states or one\nstate as a theoretical discussion.\nIt is neglecting and marginalising the\ndaily suffering of the Palestinians in\nGaza, the West Bank and in the refugee\ncamps which pushes us to placing at the\nhead of our agenda the matter of occu-pation.\nI am worried that we will forget even\nthe word occupation \u2013 you realise that\nduring the negotiation no one uses the\nword occupation. We forget that at the\ncentre of negotiations should be ending\noccupation and not just freezing it and\nAfter three hours of questioning and \u201csecurity checks\u201d it was with some relief\nthat our group finally left the bowels of\nBen Gurion airport and stepped out into\nthe warm Mediterranean night. Soon\nafter arriving at our first destination of\nJerusalem we entered the Old City and\nwandered through the maze of crooked\nstreets in awe at the splendour and majesty of our surroundings. Jerusalem is\na truly special city. The cobbles drip\nwith history and excavations reveal, in\ndistinct layers below the surface, how it\nwas razed and reconstructed repeatedly\nby different civilisations.\nYet scratch beneath the surface and\nviolence has never been far. Where the\nWestern Wall Plaza now stands used to\nbe the city\u2019s ancient Moroccan quarter.\nOn the 10th June 1967, after capturing\nEast Jerusalem from the Jordanians, the\nIsraeli army gave the 650 inhabitants of\nthe quarter a few hours\u2019 notice to abandon their homes. They then set about\ndemolishing the entire area to make way\nfor the Plaza. By the admission of Israeli commanders themselves, many of\nthose who refused to leave were killed.\nLeaving Jerusalem, it does not take\nlong to reach the now infamous West\nBank barrier. Concrete, sheer and\ntopped by great arcs of barbed wire, this\nsymbol of the conflict snakes its way\nthrough the country, separating Israeli\ncitizens from the Palestinians Arabs living just behind it.\nOne of the most striking aspects noticeable while travelling behind the wall\nis the number of Israeli settlements that\npepper the landscape. Huge obstacles to\nany current peace deal, these colonial\noutposts are well developed. Ariel, the\nlargest of its kind in the northern West\nBank, is home to over 15,000 settlers\nand has its own university. The settler-only roads that criss-cross the landscape\nand connect these towns to each other,\nalong with the different number plates\nthat Israeli and Palestinian drivers are\nforced to use, lead to countless comparisons with apartheid South Africa.\nIn the midst of all this the one seemingly obvious question which is seldom\naddressed is the following: \u201cWhere exactly is the long-proposed Palestinian\nstate supposed to go?\u201d\nThe Israelis have de facto annexed almost 50% of the land in the West Bank\nas fully Israeli controlled or of restricted\naccess to Palestinians. Almost 500,000\nIsraeli citizens live in settlements located in the West Bank or East Jerusalem\n\u2013 all of which are recognised as illegal\nunder international law by the United\nNations, the European Union and the\nUnited States.\nHowever, although they are illegal,\nit is also surely fantasy to imagine that\nthey will ever be removed. The evacuation of all settlements in the Gaza strip\nand four in the West Bank under Ariel\nSharon opened bitter rifts in Israeli society and the task of displacing hundreds\nof thousands of settlers, many of whom\nwould certainly resist, is not a realistic\nplan for any future prime minister. Why\nthen do the negotiating parties continue\nin the endless stalemate of talks based\non a two-state solution that will never be\nimplemented?\nMany of the Palestinians we spoke to\nstated in conversation that they would\nprefer a single state with equal rights\nand freedom of movement for all. At\nthe beginning of this month, Gregorey\nLevey, himself a former speechwriter\nfor two Israeli prime ministers, said in\nan interview with Time that increasing numbers of Palestinians are saying\n\u201cForget it. We\u2019ll have one state. We\ndon\u2019t want our own state, but we want\na vote.\u201d Despite this apparently growing\nmomentum, the one state solution is still\noften dismissed as a \u201cfad\u201d and not discussed at a serious level.\nParadoxically, when the first ideological settlers started building on the\nlands captured by Israel in 1967, they\nput into motion a sequence of events\nwhich now makes it seem less likely\nthan ever that Israel can remain a Zionist state. This is because the settlers\nhave entrenched themselves so deeply\nthat they will surely stay, and yet no\nIsraeli leader in the foreseeable future seems likely to attempt the ethnic\ncleansing that would be necessary to\nremove the millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank. The result is two\ncommunities which, despite their mutual loathing for one another, are bound\nto living cheek by jowl.\nOpponents of the one-state solution\nincluding Levey claim that it would lead\nto civil war, and that the two communities can never hope to coexist. But this\nneed not be the case. If people are treated with dignity and not subject to ritual\nhumiliation as part of their daily lives\nthen it seems more likely that a situation\nconducive to peace will form. Things\nare undeniably better in the West Bank\nnow since the end of the First Intifada\n\u2013 the checkpoints remain but generally\nallow traffic to pass and the university\nwhich we visited boasted truly impressive facilities.\nFor the 25,000 residents living in the\nsquare kilometre slum that is Balata\nrefugee camp, they may as well be living in a constant Intifada. Here, there\nis abject poverty and Israeli incursions\nare frequent. The gaps between houses\nare sometimes not wide enough for two\npeople to walk abreast and with 40%\nunemployment and an exploding young\npopulation (70% are below the age of\n18), life is very hard indeed. They are located less than 30 miles from the coastal\ncity of Tel Aviv yet have grown up without ever seeing the sea. The newest generation may turn out to be less moderate and more hardened by war than any\nthat have come before because they will\nhave never tasted the privileges of living\nin a free society.\nIf one can take anything from the\nWestern Wall Plaza and Balata camp\nother than acrid depression, then it\nshould be the deep knowledge that both\npeoples are there to stay. Neither are\ngoing anywhere and there will never\nbe peace in the Middle East until this\nis accepted.\npreserving the status quo. Year after year\nwe are negotiating to freeze the status\nquo and the real negotiations which take\nplace on the ground leads to expanding\nsettlements. So the aim of these negotiations is just to give legitimacy to occupation instead of ending it. I am afraid\nthat entering your discussion of one\nstate or two states would again change\nthe terminology, and we would again be\nhelping Israel to deepen and expand the\noccupation.\nTo many British Arabs, the Labour\nParty in the UK has played a role in\nlegitimising Israeli aggression. Why\ndid you attend the Labour Party con-ference?\nI attended the Labour Party conference\non the invitation of Labour Friends of\nPalestine who, if they were to lead the\nBackground facts\nArab Israelis \u2013 Currently about 20% of Israel\u2019s 7.6m population is of\nArab ethnicity.\nWest Bank barrier \u2013 Israel started erecting this concrete separation\nbarrier in 2002. It is planned to be a 709km long at the border between the West Bank and Israel, of which 409km has been constructed (as of August 2009).\nIsraeli settlements \u2013 Jewish communities or towns located in occupied territories Israel captured during the 1967 Six Day war. Israel\nofficially has 227 settlements (considered illegal by the international\ncommunity) housing 500,000 residents. There are no longer any settlements in the Gaza Strip, following the disengagement in 2005.\nThese facts are a simple guide to give context to the interview and\narticle.

The claim was rejected by Union\nPresident Alex Kendall who said that all\nstudents were able to find accommodation and that the free gym was proof\nthat Mr Jackman cared about students.\nCouncil voted to reject Mr Jackman by\n13 votes to 5 with 5 abstentions. George\nPalos, a chartered surveyor and former\nImperial student was approved by Council by 22 votes to 1 with no abstentions.\nMr Jackman said to Felix \u201c Clearly I\nKadhim Shubber\nam disppointed that I won\u2019t be able to\nplay a role in the ICU but naturally respect the Council\u2019s decision and wish\nthe organization and all at Imperial every success in the future\u201d\nPhoto by Marie Chkaiban\nPhoto by Tom Roberts\nBeard...

    "content": "FELIX Friday 15 October 2010 5\nThe last few months have not been good\nfor the Liberal Democrats. With poll\nratings plummeting from 23 to 14%\nsince joining the coalition, the reality of\npower for the first time in over a century is quickly turning into a nightmare.\nLow party morale and a new (but not,\nhe stresses, New) Labour leader keen to\nbrand the coalition as \u2018the nasty parties\u2019\nhave left the Lib Dem\u2019s top brass finding it increasingly difficult to keep the\nsizeable left of the party in tow. In short,\nthis is the worst possible time to test the\nparty members\u2019 commitment to the coalition\u2019s shotgun marriage.\nTuesday\u2019s publication of Lord\nBrowne\u2019s Higher Education Review\ncould prove to be the starting gun for\ndissent among Lib Dem MPs, itching\nto distance themselves from the already\nbiting austerity measures introduced by\nthe government. The rebels among them\naccuse their leadership of abandoning a\nmanifesto pledge to scrap fees, not raise\nthem. They also claim that the review\u2019s\nproposals are against the progressive\nprinciples of what it is to be a Liberal\nDemocrat, that the party has lost its\nidentity to the Conservative party, making no real impact on the coalition\u2019s di-rection.\nOn the former point, they are undoubtedly correct. The Lib Dem\u2019s made\na clear promise that they would push to\nscrap fees altogether, with Nick Clegg\nappearing in a party video targeting stu-dents, calling fees \u2018wrong\u2019. No amount\nof clever politics can disguise the fact\nthat accepting the Review\u2019s proposal (or\nabstaining from the vote) will amount to\na complete u- turn: resulting in uncapped\nfees. Yes, they can blame the economic\nclimate, but they knew the country was\nstrapped for cash before the election.\nThat the new proposals are regressive,\nhowever, is less arguable - the poorest\n20% of students will actually pay less\nunder the Browne proposals than they\ndo today. Nonetheless, this doesn\u2019t take\naway from the dizzying headline figures\nof potential student debt and the impression this will give the public of impossibly expensive education. The opposition of the NUS doesn\u2019t help, sweeping\nmasses of students into the welcoming\narms of Ed Milliband\u2019s Labour party;\nthe same students who just in the last\nelection voted in great numbers for the\nLib Dems.\nHowever, there is still hope for the\nparty. The new Austerity Britain is much\nmore open to consider changes in the\nrole of government which would have\nbeen unthinkable just 2 years ago. A\nmore open and honest public debate has\nlead to general agreement that the state\nmust tighten its belt and, if Britain\u2019s top\nuniversities are to remain competitive,\nthis may have to be made up for with\nhigher fees. While there will likely be no\nlove lost between the Lib Dems and stu-dents, the party can still target the much\nlarger slice of the electoral pie that ac-Porter argued that the proposals would\n\u201cleave graduates with crippling amounts\nof debt, and deter applicants from poorer\nbackgrounds.\u201d\nThe NUS also warned the Liberal\nDemocrats against betraying the students who voted for them in the general\nelection. They claimed that if the government adopted the recommendations,\nthey would be handing a \u2018blank cheque\u2019\nto universities, without any proof that\nthe increased funds would improve stan-dards.\nThe proposal of increasing the threshold for repayment to \u00a321,000 means\ngraduates will pay 9p of every pound\nearned above this threshold, meaning\nthat the average Imperial graduate starting on \u00a328,116 will begin paying \u00a353\nper month immediately, significantly\nless than the \u00a391 they would have been\npaying under the current system. However, the total amount paid back will be\nconsiderably greater; not just because of\nincreased fees, but also because the government will now charge real interest on\nthe loans (previously kept at inflation) of\n2.2% on top of inflation. Business Secretary Vince Cable has also suggested a\npenalty for early repayment of loans, to\nprevent wealthier graduates paying less\nby avoiding interest building up.\nThe proportion of the population going\nto university has gone up considerably\nin recent years; increasing by 44% in the\nlast 10 years alone. Many have argued\nthat this has undermined the value of a\ndegree, with many polytechnic colleges\nbecoming universities and many courses\nbeing revamped as degrees. The huge\nboost in funding that these proposals\nwould give to the country\u2019s top universities may start to reverse this trend; with\nother universities feeling pressured into\nproviding \u2018softer\u2019 courses in two years\nto reduce spending, the elite universities\nmay start to pull ahead as in the past, as\npotentially the only ones able to afford\nfull degree courses.\nThere is some doubt as to where this\nleaves Higher Education in Britain.\nLord Browne insists that the proposed\ncepts the need for tough fiscal measures.\nEd Milliband\u2019s party conference speech\nabout balancing work and life received\na lukewarm response from a public\nwanting fiscal action. The left in the Lib\nDems may simply not \u2018get\u2019 the public\nmood. What Clegg and Cable need to\nconvince their party, and the electorate,\nis that they will somehow reign in what\nwould otherwise have been savage Tory\nfee increases. By positioning his party as\neconomically responsible yet fairer than\nthe Conservatives, Nick Clegg may yet\ncome out of the Browne debate on top.\nreforms would put more power into the\nhands of students, on whom universities will be more reliant, enabling them\nto \u2018vote with their money\u2019 and leave\nunpopular institutions to the mercy of\nthe market. However, many groups (in-cluding the NUS) have voiced concerns\nthat potential students from poorer\nfamilies with the ability to study may\nbe put off by the fees, or choose lesser\nuniversities or courses, on the basis of\nprice. There have also been fears aired\nthat the proposals could create a two\ntiered system of rich and poor universi-ties. Whatever the effects on enrolment,\nthe shift in university education from\neffectively a state subsidised right to a\nserious financial investment, the proposals have the potential to change the\nvery way that higher education is seen\nin this country.\nLib Dems in trouble\nover higher fees\nRory Fenton\nRajat Jain\nCap on Fees\nWhat does the\nreview say?\nNEWS\nCurrent:\n\u00a33,290\nBrowne:\nGovernment\nbacked loan\nup to \u00a36,000\nBrowne:\nBut also\nno overall\ncap\nTime after which loan is written\noff if not repaid\nCurrent:\n25 years\nBrowne:\n30 years\nSalary at which you start\nrepayments\nCurrent:\n\u00a315,000\nBrowne:\n\u00a321,000\nEditorial: Page 18\nNUS President: Page 18\nYep Nick, that\u2019s going to be your\nhairline when this is all over...\nGraphics by Victoria McQuadeova\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 15 October 2010 11\nSCIENCE\nshould the cuts be as severe as many\nanalysts predict, there is a danger that\nour top scientists will start to leave the\nUK for greener pastures: pastures where\nscience research receives the funding it\nso fully deserves.\nThis danger is accentuated by the fact\nthat, at a time when the UK is considering cutting its science research budget,\nother countries are pumping money into\nscience as a way to boost their economic\nrecovery.\nBarack Obama for one has made his\nfeelings about the necessity of well-funded research quite clear: \u201cAt such\na difficult moment, there are those who\nsay we cannot afford to invest in sci-ence, that support for research is somehow a luxury at moments defined by\nnecessities. I fundamentally disagree.\nScience is more essential for our pros-perity, our security, our health, our en-vironment, and our quality of life than it\nhas ever been before.\u201d\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy\nwas also supportive of funding science\nresearch in a speech made this summer:\n\u201cScience is, I am well aware, a fragile\nenterprise and scientists must be defended against obscurantism, fanaticism,\nwilful ignorance and contempt for the\ntruth. The economic downturn should\nnot prompt us to postpone investment\nin science, but rather to bring it forward\n\u201cScience is more essential for our prosper-ity. our security, our health, our environment,\nand our quality of life than it has ever been\nbefore.\u201d\nand consolidate it.\u201d\nYet, perhaps the most damming criticism of the UK government\u2019s plan to cut\nscience research funding came not from\na world leader, or even from a scientist,\njournalist or politician, but instead came\nsimply from the daughter of a recent Alzheimer\u2019s victim.\nVivienne Hill, whose mother died\nin April, was speaking at the rally as a\nchampion of the UK Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust, claims that there is a dirty\nlittle secret that the government does not\nwant us to know.\nThe UK is currently second only to\nHolland in terms of the proportion of its\npopulation who give money to medical\nresearch charities. This fact has, in her\nopinion, led the government to believe\nthat any cuts made to funding medical\nresearch will be compensated for by the\ngenerosity of UK citizens.\nProtesters came prepared with slogans, some more witty than others\nThe crowd gathered outside the Treasury with high profile campaigners\nImperial researchers in Eureka top 100\n50 Prof Sir John Pendry\n60 Prof Sir Peter Knight\n63 Prof Jim Virdee\n75 Prof Simon Donaldson\n75 Prof David Nutt\n81 Prof Guang-Zhong Yang\n84 Prof Lord Robert Winston\n100 Prof Sir Roy Anderson\nShe says, \u201cThe government simply\nexpects the public to pick up the slack.\u201d\nPlainly, such exploitation of public\nkindness cannot be tolerated.\nWithin a matter of just two weeks, the\n\u2018Science is Vital\u2019 campaign managed to\nmobilise over 2,000 supporters for last\nweekend\u2019s rally and its online petition\nnow has over 28,000 signatures.\nBy the time this goes to press, the\ngroup will also have lobbied parliament.\nHowever, the scientists\u2019 pleas may\nstill prove to have fallen on deaf ears\nwhen George Osborne\u2018s Governmental Spending Review is published next\nThursday.\nYet, at least one thing is for sure; UK\nscientists can no longer be accused of\ntaking refuge in their \u2018ivory towers\u2019 and\nrefusing to engage in public debate.\nPerhaps the most important point to\ncome out of the rally is that UK scientists have taken their first major step in\nengaging and communicating their work\nto the public at large.\nIn the past, the science community\nhas hardly been held up as a paragon of\ngood PR skills. Yet, it would now seem\nthat more and more scientists are finally\nrealising that their ability to communicate with, and be held accountable by the\npublic at large is an increasingly important element of the role they have to play\nin today\u2019s modern liberal democracy.\nAt the very least, the rally induced a\nfew translucent-skinned science geeks\nto leave the lab and seek new frontiers\nand horizons in the fabled world of \u2018outdoors\u2019.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 15 October 2010 27\nThis picture looks happy and normal, but look closer... count the fingers... Did you count them? Crazy right?\nwalked on to Kleine Sclidegg to a campsite behind a restaurant and were joined by some rather charming French children and musical goats.\nThe restaurant had a lovely view of Grindewald and the route we had walked. The next\nday we started our descent back into a valley,\nwe went to Schetlberg to the campsite Rutti.\nThis was quite a nice campsite location-wise,\nbut some thieving foxes stole both Yvonne\u2019s\nand my lunchboxes (they just couldn\u2019t resist\nthe taste of the amazing Polenta we cooked\u2026.)\nand the washing machine stole Rafal\u2019s socks.\nVery strange. We decided to extend our stay\nhere by another day and do a day walk up to a\nhut where Jim\u2019s clever disguise fell apart and\nrevealed he was actually Gollum. We have evi-dence: climbing down a moraine and trying to\nfish in a lake on the way back.\nWe got to the hut, really impressing the owners with our massive bags and obvious hardcore hiking spirit, only to disappoint them the\nnext day by lying in and going on pathetic short\nwalks. This hut was the nicest place we stayed,\nwe had a lovely view of the mountains and the\npeople that owned it were absolutely lovely.\nThe food was delicious and plentiful, they actually managed to fill Jim up both nights in a row,\na task up until now thought impossible.\nOn the rest day, Jim and Joe went off and did\ntheir mental walk down to a hut somewhere\nmiles away, and up something that people with\nclimbing gear turned away from because it\nlooked a bit hard. This was The Vendre Butlasse and at 3031m, the near fatal scrambling\nit took to get to the top paid off as they finally\nbroke the 3000m. The dodgy scrambling undoubtedly amused the on-looking Ibex, seemingly always above the two.\nThe rest of us did a mixture of either walking\nup to a pass nearby that had a view of some\nmountains further on and then swimming in a\nlake made of snowmelt (freezing but beautiful)\nor staying in the hut playing games. There were\nsome rather sweet American kids who watched\nthe game playing, giving out handy tips and insulting Ande, so they were pretty popular with\neveryone, especially Rafal who got on with everyone like a house on fire.\nWe had another night of lovely food and discovered the game Blokus, a funny variation of\nTetris that was completely impossible to everyone except Ande who almost exploded because\nhe couldn\u2019t quite believe we made the moves\nthat we chose and kept asking scary questions\nlike \u201cBut why did you put that there?\u201d when\nthere was probably no right answer.\nThere was a massive cable car all the way up\nthe mountain and we all felt very smug reaching the top with our heavy bags. There was a\ncable car load that arrived about when we did\nand Chris and Ande accosted some poor tourists and told them all about our trip for hours (I\nwas told it was the other way round and they\nwanted to know about our trip but I\u2019m not sure\neither Chris or Ande know how to stop talking).\nWhile we were up there, we watched a video\nabout the Schilthorn being the set for the Bond\nfilm \u201cOn Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service\u201d which\nfeatured not just clips from the film but a lot of\ncheesy shots of Switzerland and a crazy dancing lady dressed in white who popped up every so often for no apparent reason. The view\nfrom the Schilthorn was fantastic; we saw all\nthe mountains we had been walking past for the\nlast week and more much further on.\nWe walked down to Blumenthal to camp behind a restaurant again that had a trampoline\n(!!), and Raf had his first ever go on a tram-poline. We also washed the MSR pots properly for the first time on the trip. They were\nSO SHINY. Then we went down to Suls to the\nhut there. We had our last dinner which didn\u2019t\nquite trump the infamous Gouda cheese cake\nof last year for inventive inedibility, but it was\nat least tasty. The starter was a slightly bizarre\ntinned-meat-and-pastry-twists thing (the less\nsaid the better really), then we had chilli which\nresembled real chilli in that it was made with\nsmoked sausage, ginger and celeriac\u2026 The\nwin of the evening was the waffles with fried\npineapple, chocolate, condensed milk and apple puree. The next day was the final walk back\ndown to Wilderswil to complete our circle. We\nstocked up on chocolate to take home and alcohol to drink and went for the last supper at a\nlocal restaurant.\nThe next day we went to Zurich to get the\nflight home. We spent a few hours looking\naround at all these lovely shops we could never\nafford to buy anything from and then went to\nthe airport to find that our flight had been de-layed, by what was to become 4.5 hours. But\nsome of us managed to swindle EasyJet out of\nan extra food voucher and we did manage to\nget on the plane in the end \u2013 it was a bit of a\nsqueeze because after noon some sort of noise\nreduction law meant that there were no flights\nallowed and we boarded the plane at quarter to,\nbut it happened and we got back.\nThus concludes the tale of one group\u2019s tour\nthrough breathtaking scenery, defying back-pack-induced hardship, painful ascents and\nquestionable cuisine to complete one of the\nmost awe-inspiring routes on the planet, the\nTour of the Jungfrau. The summer tour finished\noff what has been, for me, an amazing year\nwith the Fellwanderers. The club is accessible\nfor people of any level of fitness or experience\nand everyone in the club is really sociable,\nfriendly, fun and up for a challenge. The weekend trips throughout the year were a great way\nto get away from work and out of London and\nthe tours are fantastic holidays that give a real\nsense of achievement.\nIf this appeals to you then come and get\nin contact with this year\u2019s president, Jim\nCarr at james.carr08@imperial.ac.uk.\nHope to see you soon!\n\u201cJim\u2019s clever disguise fell\napart and revealed he\nwas actually Gollum. We\nhave evidence: climbing down a moraine and\ntrying to fish in a lake on\nthe way back\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 15 October 2010\n4\nUniversities should be unlimited in\ncharging fees to students, the Browne\nreview of university funding has recom-mended. The influential review, released\nearly this week, outlined various proposals and potential changes in higher\neducation funding to the government,\nincluding lifting the current cap on annual tuition fees, which currently stand\nat \u00a33,290. The review also proposed\nraising the threshold earning salary for\ngraduate repayment to \u00a321,000 to ease\nthe rise.\nLord Browne, a member of the House\nof Lords, former CEO of BP and President of the Royal Academy of Engineering, started the review panel in\nNovember 2009 in order to consider the\n\u201cbalance of contributions to universities by taxpayers, students, graduates\nand employers to university finances\u2019\u2019,\nas described by Lord Mandelson. Initial\nfindings were published in March 2010,\nwhere it was heard that students were\nnot deterred by current fees but the system was inadequate, and the full review\nwas published last Tuesday following\nsubmissions from various student and\nuniversity groups.\nThe main recommendation of the report was that the current cap of \u00a33,290\nbe lifted, allowing universities the freedom to charge as much as they need. The\nreport, released under the title \u201cSecuring\na Sustainable Future for Higher Education\u2019\u2019, made further recommendations\nthat universities no longer be required to\nprovide a minimum bursary (currently\n\u00a3329) for full grant students. Suggestions include distributing this bursary\nthrough the grants system instead. Tuition fees up to \u00a36,000 are recommended\nto be underwritten by the government,\nand fees greater are levied in that universities keep a diminishing proportion\nfor every thousand over \u00a36,000. Namely\n40% , 45% and 50% of the first, second\nand third respectively.\nThe report continued to suggest that\nstudents should not have to pay tuition\nfees up front, and that part time students\nbe eligible for loans under the higher\neducation funding scheme. The threshold for graduate repayment is proposed\nto rise to \u00a321,000 from the current\n\u00a315,000, with the inclusion of the period\nafter which debts are written off rising to\n30 years from the current 25. The interest rate is applied when earnings reach\nthis threshold and stand at the current\namount for borrowing from government\n(2.2%). Money owed would rise with inflation regardless of earnings. The report\nalso suggests increasing both the maintenance grant to \u00a33,250 from the current\n\u00a32,906 for households with incomes less\nthan \u00a325,000 and the upper threshold for\npartial maintenance grants to \u00a360,000\nfrom \u00a350,020.\nAlongside changes to fees, the review\nrecommended a shake-up in university\nregulation. At present there are four\nhigher education bodies; HEFCE; Quality Assurance agency; Office for fair access and the Office of the Independent\nadjudicator. The review argued that\nthese should be merged into one Higher\nEducation Council. This body would\nhave the power to bail out failing univer-sities. No university has ever gone bank-rupt, but in the \u2018free-market for education\u2019 advocated by Browne, this would\nbe a real possibility. Early calculations\nsuggest that if institutions charge \u00a36,000\nper year or less, their overall income\nwould be slightly lower than at present.\nAs well as affecting universities as a\nwhole, the regulations would also oblige\nstaff and students to meet higher stan-dards. Academic staff with teaching responsibilities would have to undertake\na teaching qualification. The review advised a minimum level of UCAS points\nfor students to be eligible for financial\nsupport, taking into account the demand\nand budget for individual courses.The\nfunding gained by the extra fees would\nallow a 10% increase in university places over three years. Universities charging over \u00a37,000 per year, will be subject\nto scrutiny, ensuring that these extra\nfunds are being used fairly to encourage\nstudents from poorer backgrounds.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband warned\nagainst the proposed \u2018free market\u2019 in\neducation. He offered to \u201cwork with\nanybody in the House of Commons who\nwants a progressive system of finance\u201d,\nan unspoken appeal to members of the\nLiberal Democrats who campaigned in\nthe general election to keep the current\ncap on fees.\nLord Browne defended his recom-mendations, saying \u201cWe have taken off\nthe cap, but we haven\u2019t taken off the restrictions\u201d\nBut student groups have criticised\nthe review as unfair on the next generation of students. In this paper, National\nUnion of Students President Aaron\nLord Browne (pictured) has recommended lifting the cap on university tuition fees\nThe main recommendation is\nthat universities be allowed to\ncharge as much as they want\nBrowne points to\nhigher fees\nAlex Karapetian\nAnna Perman\nRory Fenton\nRead this article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nUniversity finance\nThere\u2019s a desperate need for extra\nmoney for universities\nUniversity funding reform has been a long time com-ing; the principle of free education for all, long a\nmainstay of British political thought, had to be abandoned in 1998 following a review by Lord Dearing.\nPublic funding had for many years failed to keep\npace with increasing student numbers: between\n1989 and this first introduction of fees, funding per\nstudent fell by 36%.\nThe initial \u201ctop-up\u201d fee of \u00a31000 per year was\nincreased, in 2006, to \u00a33000 (subsequently increasing in line with inflation). This is roughly half\nthe cost of the average university degree; though it\nonly covers a third of the average degree at Imperial. The remainder of the course cost is \u2013 theoretically \u2013 made up by the Government. However, despite higher fees bringing in an additional \u00a31.3bn,\naverage spending per student is still lower than it\nwas in 1992.\nAs such, British universities remain heavily under-funded; we spend 1.3% of our total GDP on university education, compared with an OECD average of\n1.5%. Given British universities\u2019 high quality of education and research compared to our better funded\nEuropean counterparts, it seems unlikely that \u201cefficiency-drives\u201d are the key to saving this particular\ngovernment subsidised industry.\nThis financial difficulty has resulted in many institutions going into the red; 38 out of 142 universities in England and Wales produced a deficit in the\nacademic year ending 2009; a further increase from\nthe 27 in the previous year. While this shows over\n70% of universities had a small surplus (Imperial\nwith a relatively high \u00a314m, or about 2% of its operating budget), in general it doesn\u2019t mean they are\nactually coping; universities across the country are\nclosing departments, with other similarly desperate\nmeasures being taken. This year one of the best philosophy courses in the English speaking world was\nclosed at Middlesex University because it didn\u2019t generate enough profit.\nYou will no doubt have read in last week\u2019s front\npage article about the controversial and contested\nLife Sciences restructuring at Imperial, an attempt\nto eliminate the department\u2019s deficit; this is not the\nonly measure the university has taken to balance\nthe books. The university charges twice as much\nas it needs to for international students, in order\nto cover the cost of British and Europeans. Certain departmental courses are also heavily over-subscribed, sometimes to the extent that there\nare more students than seats in lecture halls; this\nmay have contributed to keeping the university in\nsurplus.\nUniversities are not only centres for education;\nthey are also home to the nation\u2019s publically funded\nresearch and development. These financial problems will therefore have a profound effect, not only\non the quality of education available, but on the\nquantity of world class research taking place in Britain; both are vital to the long term prospects of any\neconomy.\nWith this desperate financial situation, change to\nthe system is needed; the question is whether or\nnot Browne\u2019s proposals point in the right direction.\nRajat Jain\nNavid Nabijou\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Especially when it has enjoyed much\nsuccess in the recent years thanks to a revival\nof interest \u2013 evidently so judging by the social\nmedia attention it is receiving \u2013 and regarding\nEurope\u2019s status as a fashionable tourist destina-tion. It will definitely suffer, above all in the\nmonetary sense, and will most likely continue\nto suffer long after the US travel alert expires\nnext January.\nBut how does it affect us as independent\ntravellers? Should we suppress our appetite for\ntravel, for the sake of our safety?\nThe world has never been truly hazard-free.\nEven back in the 1970s, a time epitomised as\nthe golden age of free-roamers and peace-lov-ing travellers, grievous words of violence and\nmonstrosities still hanged on to tips of tongues.\nPre-coup Afghanistan may then be the Mecca\nof hippism, hitchhiking then the trendiest method of travel. But people had other concerns: the\ncommunist regimes cast shadows over Russia\nand China; the majority of the African continent was engaged in civil feuds; the aftermath\nof Vietnam War and the thriving drug trade left\nmost travellers shunning Southeast Asia.\nCombined with more advanced technology,\nsafer modes of transport, more ethical practices\nof human rights, the modern world is in comparison a much safer place for the traveller.\nMany fears have to be attributed to the general melancholic and pessimistic attitudes of our\nsociety, often those carved out of media por-trayals. For instance, many would-be visitors\nto Europe \u2013 which include businessmen and\nexchange students \u2013 have been pressurised into\nreconsidering their travel plans since insurance\ncompanies cited \u2018victimisation under terrorism\u2019\nas an ineligible claim to compensation.\nSo here is my plea: do not fret over the travel\nalerts and feel intimidated by public specula-tions. Bear a realistic, yet optimistic, approach\nwhen it comes down to planning your next\nadventure, the same way you would remain\nundeterred by the latest cyclist accident from\ncycling to college.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that no precaution should be\ntaken while travelling \u2013 quite the contrary in\nfact. Do remind yourself to stay alert to your\nsurroundings and ward off potential dangers,\n\u201cWithin the past month\nover 50 countries have\nbeen pitted against by\ntravel alerts\u201d\ndisasters \u2013 one of which rendered an area the\nsize of Italy submerged, with another delivering\nhundreds of violent aftershocks \u2013 turbulence in\nthe Middle East, and promise of terrorist attacks in Europe by the US intelligence.\nWithin the past month, over 50 countries\nhave been faced with by a fresh surge of travel\nalerts, which urge subjects of the respective\nnations to practise acute caution \u2013 while some\nactively advise against \u2013 travelling to the imperilled locations. Dominating the spotlight is,\nmost certainly, Europe\u2019s latest designation as a\nhigh-risk target of terrorism, which resulted in\nthe US government issuing an official warning\nand raising awareness of the \u2018imminent\u2019 threat\nof terrorism.\nThe British Foreign Office, France, Sweden\nand Japan have since reciprocated with similar warnings of their own, further highlighting\n\u201cVisit lesser-known\ndestinations that are\nthreat-free and more\ncharming than their\ntouristic counterparts\u201d\nas long as such alertness doesn\u2019t dampen your\ncapacity of having a good time.\nAnd since terrorist activities are aimed at\nmajor cities for maximum impact, may I suggest visiting lesser-known destinations that are\nthreat-free and, in most cases, more charming\nthan their touristic counterparts? This is a fantastic opportunity to explore the so-called off-beaten tracks \u2013 it\u2019s when I get to prioritise my\ncuriosity and sense of security over an obsession of clich\u00e9s and the fear of unpredictability.\nIn hindsight, I should have gone to the Philippines \u2013 not only a dismissal of my fears and\nfears of others, or a gathering of better understanding of the current situation, but a show of\nfaith, as a traveller and travel writer, to the Filipino tourism industry.\nOne S.W.A.T. team, one hammer to share, infinite buffoonery: this is CSI: Manila\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 08 October 2010 9\nINTERVIEW\nBATTLE OF IDEAS COMES\nTO SOUTH KENSINGTON\nIf I can start by being totally honest,\nI hadn\u2019t heard of the \u2018Battle of Ideas\u2019\nbefore I found out you were coming\nto the Royal College of Art this year.\nWhat would you like people to know\nbefore they come along?\nWhen we set it up 6 years ago, we\nwanted to suggest that there was not an\nintelligent-enough public debate about\nvery important issues. In the world of\nscience, for example, everyone talks\nabout public engagement or involve-ment, and that often means \u2018dumbing\ndown\u2019 or patronising the public. So we\nwanted an intelligent public arena \u2013 not\nacademia, but something that allowed\npeople to scrutinise and interrogate\nsome of the big questions of our day.\nSo we pack a weekend full of debates\nand discussions, and we emphasise that\nalthough there are excellent speakers,\nnobody gets more than 7 minutes to\nspeak. It doesn\u2019t matter how famous\nthey are, or how far they\u2019ve flown from,\neverybody gets their 7 minutes, sometimes even less. So we have a panel of\n5 people, allowing you, in a 90-minute\nslot, 45-minutes of open conversation\nwith the audience.\nWe are always aiming for an audience\nwho are prepared to challenge and be\nchallenged, and think about these ques-tions. We want the kind of people who\nreally think they\u2019re not getting the right\nsort of answers at the moment.\nThe timetable shows a huge range\nof subjects covered: from the relationship between teachers and parents,\nthe future of the Catholic Church,\ncrime novels and even the importance\nof opera. Is there a central, linking\ntheme?\nThere are some themes, but we\u2019re not\ntrying to pretend all the sessions link in.\nOne of the big themes is the climate of\ndistrust, whether or not it\u2019s corrosive\nand creating a cynical and misanthropic\natmosphere in society. But examining\nthat issue \u2013 possibly the lack of trust is\nbecause we\u2019re less deferential, which is\npossibly a good thing.\nI\u2019d say that the climate of mistrust has\ngone too far, and that we\u2019ve internalised\na lack of trust towards each other. We\u2019re\nfrightened to let the next-door neighbour\nlook after our kids, we\u2019re told that we\ncan\u2019t be trusted to go near alcohol or\nwe\u2019ll end up as alcoholics. We\u2019re being\ntreated as children by those in authority.\nAnother theme is evidence-based\npolicy \u2013 whether there\u2019s a move to hide\nbehind the evidence instead of making\nmoral or political decisions, and the\ndanger of this for science, let alone for\ndemocracy. So we\u2019ve got a strand of\ndebates on scientific evidence, looking\nat controversies around peer review,\nand whether we\u2019re dealing with poli-cy-based evidence, or evidence-based\npolicy.\nOne of our big themes every year is \u2018a\nfree society\u2019 and the growing climate of\nilliberalism, that there are things we\u2019re\nnot allowed to talk about. That\u2019s why\nthe slogan of the festival is \u2018Free Speech\nAllowed\u2019.\nWhy the name \u2018battle\u2019? What\u2019s the\nconflict about, and who\u2019s it against?\nWe wanted to imply that this was\nnot an anodyne set of discussions. We\nweren\u2019t trying to reach consensus \u2013 there\nare ideas worth fighting over. That\u2019s not\nto say we do school-level debating stuff.\nIt was to imply that sometimes people\navoid having arguments over things\nthat matter. Sometimes we\u2019re told not\nto question, whereas we wanted to encourage a more questioning atmosphere,\nparticularly around orthodoxies. People\nshould argue passionately over what\nthey believe in, and that will sometimes\nmean they argue against each other.\nOne of the quotations picked up\nfrom the booklet was that \u201cmorality has been sidelined by facts and\nstatistics\u201d. In what sort of areas do\nyou think there\u2019s an intrusion from\nscience?\nIn a lot of social policy areas, such as\nchild-rearing, the government emphasises the need for the state to have policies of early intervention \u2013 to intervene\nin family life ever earlier. The argument\nis that the first 18 months of a child\u2019s life\nis the key time, and so parents can\u2019t be\ntrusted to get it right and the state needs\nto intervene. People in these arguments\nalways say that \u2018the neuroscience shows\nthis.\u2019 I feel this is the use of evidence in\na very dangerous way. What happens\nis that it becomes part of a campaigning political agenda you can\u2019t oppose\nbecause no one knows how to challenge\nthe evidence.\nThere\u2019s a real possible prostitution\nof science for the needs of policy. A lot\nof scientists want to feel relevant, and\njustify the work they\u2019ve put into the\nresearch.\nYou\u2019ve invited a lot of very prominent science speakers to the event,\nsuch as former Liberal Democrat MP\nDr. Evan Harris and The Times Science editor Mark Henderson. What\nwill the debate be like on the subject\nof the role of science in society?\nOur concern is that scientists rarely\nadmit that reality is more complicated\nthan the statistics. They don\u2019t trust that\nthe public will be able to handle an is-GileadAmit speaks to Claire Fox, Director of the Institute\nof Ideas, ahead of its weekend of debates at the RCA\nsue which has a less black-or-white an-swer. Scientists contribute to that view,\nand we suggest we have a more intelligent debate over the role of science in\nsociety.\nYou can\u2019t clamp down on the debate,\nbut you have to be able to use your evidence to win the argument. But even\nwhen you\u2019ve proved that, say, the MMR\njab doesn\u2019t cause autism, you can\u2019t force\npeople to take it. People should have the\nfreedom to make their own choices.\nScience shouldn\u2019t intervene with your\nown decision-making. In the field of\npublic health, scientists have become\ntoo involved in the nanny state system\nand really quite draconian anti-liberal\npolicies.\nThere\u2019s a tendency to scientism, which\nis science being overstretched, suggesting that it can explain every human\ninteraction. I feel science is one of the\nmost important human inventions, but\nit should\u2019t make claims it can\u2019t support.\nThe first thing that came to my\nmind when I heard about your conferences was the similarity to TED. If\ntheir motto is \u2018Ideas Worth Spreading\u2019, would yours be \u2018Free Speech\nAllowed?\nI think so. I\u2019m a great admirer of TED,\nand they have certainly made a greater\nbusiness case than I. They have the\ntwenty-minute lectures and that\u2019s bril-liant, but we do believe in live debate \u2013\nthis is quite an important aspect.\nThe Institute of Ideas is quite contro-versial. We don\u2019t toe the line, and we\nchallenge orthodoxies. We don\u2019t try to\npretend in all this that we are neutral.\nWe have very strong opinions, and when\nwe put on the Battle of Ideas, we enter\nthe public arena. We don\u2019t try to chair\nneutrally, we try to join in the discussion\n\u2013 while ensuring that we always invite\nour best opponents to speak.\nOrganisers of the Battle of Ideas\nFestival have released 30 Imperial-exclusive half-price tickets for\nthe weekend (30 \u2013 31 Oct) at \u00a325\neach. These can be bought through\nthe official website at http://www.\nbattleofideas.org.uk/.\nClaire Fox battling it out with her interviewer, Gilead Amit, in a show of wits\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\nFriday 15 October 2010\n16\nPolitics Editors: Hassan Joudi James Lees\nRory Fenton Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArabs in Israel\nMajid Al-Khalil interviews MK Haneen Zoabi\nWhat are your impressions of the current\npeace talks in light of the end of the settlement freeze?\nFirst of all, there is no end for the settlement\nfreeze. The declaration until now is ambiguous\nand there is a clear declaration from the side of\nNetanyahu that the Israeli settlers should play\ndown or act without any announcement, and\nthere is planning [permission] for thousands\nof housing units that they are just continuing\nwith. More importantly, this is not the discus-sion. It is another condition \u2013 another matter\nNetanyahu creates in order for the Palestinians\nto concentrate upon and really it has nothing to\ndo with negotiations, because the negotiations\nare supposed to end occupation, not to freeze\noccupation. To make this part of negotiations\nand to freeze the real negotiations which are\nsupposed to be about dismantling settlements,\nJerusalem, refugees and withdrawal from 1967\nis a Netanyahu success or an Israeli success.\nTo what extent are the Israeli Arabs represented in these peace talks?\nThere are no Israeli Arabs, there are only Palestinian citizens of Israel. They are not represented in these negotiations. The Oslo agreements\nhave excluded the Palestinians and treated\nthem as an internal Israeli issue. The Israelis\nalso treat them as an internal issue, while not\ntreating them as full citizens. We say that we\nare part of the Palestinian people, we are part\nof the Arab-Israeli struggle \u2013 and should be\npart of the solution of course! This is part of\nwhy we should refuse and even struggle against\nregarding Israel as a Jewish state and consider\nit as very dangerous for the whole Palestinian\npeople. Because firstly it will close the doors in\nfront of any possibility for the right of return\nand secondly because you would legitimise the\nracism against the Palestinian citizens. The establishment of my party, the National Democratic Assembly, was actually a reaction to the\nOslo agreement, which says that the Palestinians are just an occupation issue. We say that\nno, the Palestinian issue did not start as an occupation issue in 1967. It started as a refugee\nissue in 1948 and if we want to reach any just\nsolution, the solution must take into consideration what happened in 1948.\nCan these talks be seen as legitimate with the\nexclusion of Hamas?\nNo, those who negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people must represent the whole Palestinian people. Hamas was elected by the\nPalestinian people on the grounds of Oslo. So\nit is an absurd, tragic and strategic mistake to\nenter these negotiations without a unified - I\nwould not say Palestinian authority but a unified PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organisation]\nwhich should represent the whole Palestinian\npeople. As we know, until now Hamas has not\nrecognised the PLO. However I think they now\nhave a new attitude to being a part of the PLO\nand recognising the PLO as a representation of\nthe Palestinians. So we must rebuild the PLO\nHaneen Zoabi, Arab Member of Knesset, with IC Palestinian Soc spoke with on their trip\nin a way that will represent the whole Palestinian people including Hamas. And the PLO\nmust negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians\nwithout considering negotiations as a substitute\nfor struggle according to our historical rights\nand according to international law. Negotiation\nmust be considered as a tool among other legitimate tools and must be according to a clear\nPalestinian vision of ending occupation.\nWhile we have been travelling in the West\nBank we have been shocked by the number\nof settlements and settler-only roads that\ncover the entire territory now. It seems unlikely that much, if any, of this will be dismantled so do you still hope for a two-state\nsolution?\nUntil now we are calling for the ending of occupation and the right of the Palestinians for\na sovereign state. But the reality which has\nbeen developing over the last 8 or 10 years is\nblocking the chance and in fact the possibility\nof two states and we [are] going into a reality\nof a one-state solution. Whether it\u2019s one democratic state or a binational solution. But again,\nour formal attitude should be not the two states\nof Netanyahu, not the two states of the Zionist parties, not the two states of Israelis but the\ndemocratic states which means not two states\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nChina\nThe US ban on openly gay military personnel has\nbeen suspended by a federal judge.\nThis follows a ruling by a district judge that the\n\u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy was unconstitutional.\nThis ruling was hailed by gay rights activists as a\nvictory for strong national defence. However, they\ncautioned gay members of the armed forces from\ncoming out as the Obama administration could still\nappeal this ruling.\nThe Obama administration has been trying to repeal this policy but has been held up by conservative politicians in the US Senate. More than 12,500\nmembers of the US armed forces have been sacked\nsince 1993 under this policy which is supported by\ncertain parties who claim that having openly gay\nmembers in the armed forces would lower troop\nmorale.\nUSA\nKyrgyzstan\nBallot papers in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s first parliamentary elections are to be recounted following the\nelection on Sunday.\nThis follows widespread concerns about irregularities and protests by losing parties over the\nelection results which saw five of the 29 participating political parties exceeding the 5% threshold needed to enter the 120 seat Parliament.\nThe far right Ata Zhurt party narrowly won the\nlargest share of the vote with 8.8% of all votes\ncast, but will not be able to govern on its own.\nThis is the first election in Kyrgyzstan after a\nnew constitution in June, and a mass revolt in\nApril which left hundreds of people dead.\nfor two nations - because again, we refuse [to\nrecognise] Israel as a Jewish state, we believe\nit should be a democratic state. When we say\ntwo states we must really differentiate between\ntwo possibilities: The two states of Netanyahu\nwith [Palestinian controlled] cantons and local\nauthorities and a Jewish state. This is the Israeli\nscenario of two states which we refuse.\nWe suggest another scenario. Not with Palestinian cantons without an army, without Jerusalem and keeping the settlements as the Israelis suggest, but a sovereign Palestinian state\nacross the full lands of 1967, Jerusalem and the\ndismantlement of the settlements; and beside it,\na state for all of its citizens. This is what my\nparty, the National Democratic Assembly is\ncalling for: a democratic state within the lands\nof 1948 which would not give privileges to Israeli Jews at the expense of the Palestinians. So\nthis scenario is not the solution of two nationalist states.\nDo you see the dismantlement of these settlements as a real possibility?\nThis is the minimum condition for peace. I cannot see a Palestinian state, a sovereign strong\nstate, with Jewish settlements. The problem is\nnot how difficult the solution is, but how the\nIsraeli establishment is convinced against it.\nAgain, this is the minimum condition for a just\npeace. We must remember that we are talking\nabout 22% of historical Palestine.\nMany of the people we have talked to have\nsaid that they would prefer a single state\nsolution with equal rights and freedom of\nmovement for all. Why is the one-state solution not discussed at a serious level? And is a\nsingle state desirable or possible?\nMahmoud Abbas entered negotiations not just\n\u201cYou realise that during\nthe negotiation no\none uses the word\noccupation\u201d\nA group of 23 Communist Party elders have\ncalled for an end to restrictions on the freedom\nof speech in a letter addressed to the National\nPeople\u2019s Congress.\nThis comes ahead of a key policy meeting in\nChina that is expected to shape Chinese policy\nfor years to come. The letter calls for people to\nbe allowed to express themselves freely on the\nInternet and demands more respect for journalists.\nThe release of this letter follows just days after the\n2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu Xiaobo\nlast week, who is currently serving an 11 year\nsentence for subversion.\n\n"

    "content": "20 felix\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY 2010\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nInnocent until proven guilty\nU\nnlike most cricket fans,\nsome of us have been\npraying for the season\nto come to an end, and\nfinally it has. It\u2019s been\na summer full of controversy, centring\non the enigma that is Pakistan. The Pakistan cricket team that is, though the\nsame could be said for the country itself.\nThis is a very unfortunate passage in the\nhistory of cricket but fortunately one\nthat comes around as often as Halley\u2019s\ncomet. What is imperative is that the issues from the spot-fixing fiasco must not\nbe swept under the carpet, something the\ncricketing world fears is on the horizon.\nThe controversy surrounded allegations of spot-fixing, of three no-balls revolving around the captain Salman Butt\nalong with seamers Mohammed Asif and\nMohammed Amir. An accusation heralded by the ever-trustworthy News of\nthe World. Their story was corroborated\nhowever, by video evidence that suggests the tale is nothing but true.\nThis is not the first time the Pakistani\nteam has been on the regulators\u2019 radar\nand, regretfully, it will not be the last. It\nis a country plagued by corruption, from\nthe playground to the President (himself\ncommonly known as \u2018Mr 10 percent\u2019).\nNaturally this corruption seeps into\nKahfeel Hussain\nthe cricket, especially when the cricket\nboard itself is government run, under the\nrule of \u2018officials\u2019 such as Ijaz Butt. Prior\nto the recent events, there were controversies at the Oval test in Pakistan\u2019s last\ntour of England and many other accusations of ball tampering on countless\nother occasions.\nThough proud, Pakistanis have often\nmaintained that such suspicions are a\nknee-jerk reaction from certain quarters\nto the \u2018reverse-swing kings\u2019 they produced over the decades (such as Wasim\nAkram and Waqar Younis), it is a stance\nthat becomes hard to keep up when one\nof the greatest emerging talents in the\nworld, Mohammed Amir, also falls prey\nto the same messy business. \u2018Allegedly\u2019,\nI should say, though the video evidence\nof the two yard no-ball does seem conclusive if we follow the official version\nof events.\nThe punishments for this scandal are\nof upmost importance to purge such actions from the game cricketing fans are\nso proud of. However, the reaction by\nthe media has been bizarre to say the\nleast. Many have called for life bans for\nthe players involved in the \u2018spot\u2019-fixing\nallegations, without properly justifying\nthis stance at all. It appears that some renowned pundits have let loose their anger\nand have finally got the opportunity to\nvent past piques without fear of reprisal.\nSome have gone even further demanding the temporary ban of the whole Pakistani cricket team, such as the likes of\nMalcolm Speed (ex ICC chairman) and\nSir Ian Botham in particular. It is also\nstrange but at the same time appalling to\nnot only see a blind eye being turned but\nmany, to the likes of Herschelle Gibbs\nand others who have themselves been\nat the other end of match- fixing allegations but received mediocre disciplinary\naction.\nSome other experts have followed a\nsimilar line, but focussing on past accusations and placing Pakistan at fault\nwhere it could never be proven so. An\nexample is of the infamous Oval test,\nfrom the previous tour, where some have\nvindicated the actions of Umpire Darell\nHair, though I fail to see the connection\nbetween the exaggerated no ball from\nMohammed Amir and the behaviour\nof the Pakistan captain (at the time Inzamam-ul-Haq) and Umpire Hair at the\nOval.\nNeutral opinions, such as that of West\nIndian fast bowling legend turned commentating legend Michael Holding, have\ncome to more logical and thought out\nconclusions. What the Pakistan play\u201cWhat is imperative\nis that the issues\nfrom the spot-fixing\nfiasco are not be\nswept under the\ncarpet\u201d\ners have done on this dark day must\ncertainly be condemned if proven true.\nHowever Michael is a proponent of the\nsecond chance philosophy, and therefore\nbelieves in a limited ban. It must also be\nrealised that this was not an incident of\nmatch-fixing as the game had not been\nthrown away deliberately by any team.\nThis viewpoint is also echoed by Pakistani Captain turned politician Imran\nKhan who is now the chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for\nJustice).The much admired, World Cup\nwinning Pakistani captain, who famously demanded of his players at the World\nCup final to fight like cornered tigers. In\nthis case the Pakistanis were definitely\ncornered but they made the suicidal mistake of locking themselves in with lions.\nRegardless of this saga, the majority\nof British born Pakistanis continue to\nremain staunch Pakistani cricket supporters ahead of the national England\nside. The question is why and there really isn\u2019t any logical answer. This is an\nextremely emotive time for Pakistan. A\ncountry in which cricket can define its\npeople. Ultimately the reputation of the\nsport of cricket has been scarred, leaving many of us with doubt as to whether\nwhat we are actually seeing will ever be\na hundred percent genuine.\nLetters Apologies + Corrections\nDear Sir, In the Freshers\u2019 Issue of Felix\nSimon Worthington wrote an entertaining piece about how to get Xboxes online without having to jump through the\nhoops that ICT puts in your path. Some\n\u201cworkarounds\u201d were suggested and\nthough Simon was (to quote him) \u201ctoo\nmuch of a pussy\u201d to recommend them to\nyou, recommend them he did.\nSimon was absolutely right in that\nboth of his suggestions *are* against the\nAcceptable Use Policy of the network.\nHis first suggestion was to muck\nabout with MAC addresses. We call this\n\u201cspoofing\u201d and don\u2019t like it very much.\nAt best it is unhelpful when we\u2019re debugging a network issue and at worst\nfraudulent. We also have a legal obliga-tion, reinforced by our upstream internet provider (ja.net, the UK academic\nnetwork) to be able to tie all traffic back\nto a known source. Deliberate concealment by spoofing is frowned upon and\nso we look out for it. \u2019Nuff said.\nAs for sticking a router on the network \u2013 we really don\u2019t like that. Apart\nfrom our macho need to be in control of\nthe active devices on the network, routers and suchlike almost by definition\ninterfere with its operation. Worse, they\ncan affect other people \u2013 perhaps even\ndenying them connectivity (for exam-ple, they run a dhcp server). Managing\nnetworks well when you don\u2019t control\nall the components is impossible, so we\nask you not to plug in anything that is\nnot a properly registered host.\nHowever, of most interest to me was\nthe impression given in the article that\nregistering a device is hard. Is it? Harder than spoofing your MAC address? If\nit genuinely is, please let me know and\nI\u2019ll try to do something about it. My\nteam do respond to registration requests\nimmediately, not that we get all that\nmany (five last year, I think).\nSimon is kind enough to say that\nImperial Internet is one of the fastest\naround. We work hard to achieve this.\nFor you. We *like* it to be used, for recreational as well as academic purposes.\nWe only try to prevent illegal activities\nand actions which interfere with another\nuser. The AUP is there because the network is a shared environment, so there\nneeds to be an operating framework.\nAfter all, without rules where would\nwe be?\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Williams\nNetwork manager, ICT\nLast week Felix published a letter\nwhich in retrospect was inappropriate.\nIt incorrectly stated that Jane Neary is\nthe Head of Catering (she is the Director of Commercial Services, Jemma\nMorris is the Head of Catering) and\nbelittled the efforts of catering staff in\nthe Senior Common Room (SCR). It is\nnot Felix\u2019s desire this year to unnecessarily attack hard working College staff\nand in that respect the letter was an unfortunate blip. We did not make the appropriate efforts to represent opposing\nviews of catering in the SCR or to ensure the right-to-reply and we apologise\nfor that. In addition we recognise the\nnegative impact that the letter had on\nstaff morale and we further apologise\nfor any hurt or offense caused. Felix is\ncompletely editorially independent of\nthe Union and articles published in Felix are in no way a reflection of the Union\u2019s positions. The letter represented\nthe views of the author (a student) and\nthe author only. Felix will continue to\npublish the views of students (however\ncontroversial) and support their right to\ndo so, but will strive to do this in a more\nresponsible manner in future.\nThe Editor An alternative view of catering in the SCR\n\n"

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 15 OCTOBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nO\nh, I\u2019m sorry. I must\u2019ve\nbeen emailing my imaginary Felix editor\nwith an entirely imagined column about\nthe need for you to shut your traps and\nadjust to life a bit better. My mistake.\nThat would explain the reams of whiny\ntoss on Facebook, Twitter, newspapers and my latest Moaning Gitfaces\nWeekly. Although the latter was a whiny\ntoss special edition, so that absolves it\nsomewhat.\nSo the government want to charge\nmore for university, eh? My, that is quite\nthe situation. I mean, the actual amount\nyou pay off each month/year is unlikely\nto change. And as long as the loans are\nstill available \u2013 which they always will\nbe \u2013 there\u2019s little barrier to entering uni-versity. Will you be paying your loan off\nfor most of your life? Well, yes. Will you\nnotice it between the myriad other bills\nyou\u2019ll be paying? I imagine not.\nIt\u2019s not your fault. The drive to push\nmore people into university has probably made you feel none of this is a big\ndeal any more. It is, of course. You\u2019re\ngoing to voluntarily cough up another\nAngry Geek\nfour years of your life to learn almost\neverything there is to know about a given topic. But because almost everyone\nyou know has also toddled off to uni-versity, it feels like it\u2019s just something\npeople do.\nAs Imperial graduates, you will, almost\nwithout doubt, be the highest earners in\nthe country compared with others in your\ngeneration. That may not be why you\ncame here, but it is an almost inescapable\nside effect, unless you\u2019re mentally damaged enough to want to write for Felix\nand become a journalist, hyuk hyuk.\nField Marshal Happypants Aaron Porter of the National Union of Students has\ncalled the cuts \u2018crippling\u2019and \u2018reckless\u2019,\ndespite the fact that the qualifying salary\nfor paying back the loan is only a few\nthousand pounds short of the average\nwage (a wage which many Imperial students earn from the day they graduate).\nEven coupled with an interest rate rise,\nit\u2019s hard to believe that the next generation will be scrabbling around in the dirt\nlooking for theorems to prove.\nWhat does this come down to? For\nsome \u2013 but by no means all of you \u2013 it\nis undoubtedly greed. You oppose paying such large sums for education, not\non a moral level, but because you love\nmoney. You came to Imperial to work in\nthe oil industry, or as part of a laughable\nplan to retire at the age of thirty-five or\nsomething. After three years of writing\nthis column, I hope I don\u2019t need to remind this particular subsection of Imperial society that, come the revolution, I\nwill be stacking you side by side, slapping cement between the lot of you and\nusing you as the wall against which I\u2019ll\nshoot the people I dislike slightly less\nthan you.\nFor the rest of you, I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s\na misunderstanding, or a feeling that\nyou\u2019re propping up the rest of society.\nThis might be true, but on some level\nit\u2019s your duty to do this. You are the\nmost able people in this country, with\nthe brightest future and the most poten-tial. Bottom of the class at Imperial is\nstill world-class in the grand scheme of\nthings. As a member of the undergraduate population, you have a role to play in\nthe world of tomorrow.\nSo get off your high horse, drink your\nmilk, and get on with that coursework.\nThere\u2019s work to do.\nS\nince I live in Cardiff and\nImperial is in London, I am\nwell-versed in the pages of\nEnglish countryside that is\nthe M4 corridor. Queues\naround Newport, chevrons outside of\nBristol, roadworks just past Reading,\nI\u2019m better than any SatNav. As well as\nspeed cameras, lane narrowing and cara-vans, there is a section of motorway life\nthat I have grown to know and loathe.\nMotorway services. They can be\nfound on every major highway, with\nmore than a hundred of them up and\ndown the country. Everyone has to use\nthem; from the slick, young drivers of\nAston Martins and Lamborghinis to the\ndoddery old dears in their caravans and\nWinnebagos. Few other public amenities can boast of such widespread usage.\nIf only the \u2018services\u2019 part could be\nboasted of as well.A stay-over can range\nin terms of pleasantness from a stroll in\nthe park on an overcast day to waiting\nin a bank queue in purgatory. Every services will have a fast-food outlet and\na quasi-restaurant-caf\u00e9 affair and the\nonly difference between them is that the\nburger bar is a bit more honest about the\n\u2018quality\u2019 of the food. And the trays are\ndifferent colours.\nIn addition to this, their prices \u2013 as\nwell as those of the customary shop (in-Rhys Davies\nvariably a WH Smith) \u2013 are extortion-ate. A pack of chewing gum once cost\nme 75p. 75p?! You could buy a small\ncountry for that price (admittedly, a very\nsmall country). In fact, it was more expensive than the overpoweringly odorous meal that I had before it. But they\nare the only services for at least twenty\nmiles and the really clever part is that\nthey have a captive audience that drove\ninto their clutches voluntarily.\nServices are always busy and nowhere\nis this truer than the toilets. There have\nbeen times when I\u2019ve visited the gents\nthat there has been standing room only\n\u2013 even in the cubicles. This isn\u2019t surprising since they are the main reason why\nmost people stop at the places to begin\nwith. Given their rate of thoroughfare,\nthey present another opportunity for\ncommercial ventures. Notice, for a start,\nhow they are always located at the back\nof the services so to reach them you\nhave to pass through the inveiglements\nof all the shops and food outlets. In truly\nhectic times, the queues will snake back\npast the arcades \u2013 very shrewd architectural planning and a temptation not\neasily resisted. But the selling goes on\neven inside the toilets. Condoms are\nstandard fare but more eclectic choices\ninclude chewable toothbrushes, balls of\nwet wipes and, my personal favourite,\n\u201chorny goat weed complex\u201d. And that\ndoesn\u2019t even cover the services advertised in the cubicles.\nSome services have a bridge that\nspans across the motorway. I know of\nno-one who has gone over one and returned to tell the tale. Still, that doesn\u2019t\nstop absent-minded wonderings over a\nCosta coffee and a Little Chef burger.\nMaybe the bridge leads to a nightmarish\nother-world filled with esoteric horrors\nand once familiar things now eldritch.\nOr maybe it leads to the services on the\nother side of the motorway, I don\u2019t know.\nUp until now, I\u2019ve been rather critical\nof motorway services but they are not\nall bad. No matter what misadventures\nyou may experience within, they do offer rest from the monotony of motorway\ndriving. Without them, we would be\ndriven to either tedium or insanity, neither of which is a preferable destination.\nTo take half an hour out to relax and do\nnothing can only be good for us.\nIt is only a shame that we don\u2019t apply this logic of the highways to the\nrest of our lives. As we struggle ever\ncloser to the twenty-five hour day, cramming more and more stuff in an already\npacked schedule, we miss out on the\nvital benefits of doing sod all. I blame\nthe motorway services. Only they could\nmake the art of nothing a chore.\nTaking an unwelcome break\n\u201cMotorway services\nhave a captive\naudience - one that\ndrove into their\nclutches voluntarily\u201d\n\u201cCome the\nRevolution, I\u2019ll be\nusing you as the wall\nagainst which I\u2019ll\nshoot the people I\ndislike slightly less\nthan you\u201d\nEmbrace the Vespa!\nDon\u2019t you just love trade un-ions? The sort that would\nstampede over their moth-ers. As the BBC\u2019s darling\nNick-specsavers-Robinson\nwas quick to note in his wet\ndream crescendo that was\nthe Labour leadership contest result, it\u2019s trade unions\nthat forced Ed Miliband into\npower. And now this bunch of\nunderused and absurd testes\nhas again brought the tube\nto a standstill in a series of\nplanned strikes.\nBut perhaps these strikes\nare a blessing. The tube is gingivitis to any brain-dead commuter at 8am. No one enjoys\nbeing crammed 40m underground like a stinking sardine\ninto a neon-lit carriage. Unless\nof course they are the type\nthat also enjoys looking at a\nfat man\u2019s haemorrhoids.\nThe train stops in a tunnel.\nIt\u2019s akin to a sauna, only with\nno towels provided. You try\ndesperately to imagine yourself in some far away land,\nperhaps on a beach with\nScarlett Johansson, yet the\ndistraction of those around\nyou is too much. There\u2019s an\narmpit in your face, a handbag\nrammed into your stomach, a\ntosser reading over your shoul-der, and a midget sniffing your\nballs. Scarlett Johansson?\nNo, the whole experience is\nfar more Deborah Meaden. If\nyou had a gun you\u2019d probably\nuse it.\nIt beggars belief that gazillions of Londoners submit\nthemselves to this rather macabre spectacle five days a\nweek. Why? The tube is not\ncheap, not even for students.\nIt still comes to \u00a370/month.\n\u00a370 that could have been\nspent on important things like\nbeer, computer games, or 10g\nof white Alba truffle.\nThere is a way out. Get a\nsecond-hand Vespa. A jewel\nof Italian design, a machine\nthat oozes sex appeal. It\u2019s not\na scooter. No, it\u2019s pure porn.\nCommuting no longer feels\nlike having your face slowly\nchafed against a cheese-grat-er. It\u2019s like going under the duvet cover when the sheets are\nclean and its cold. There\u2019s no\ncongestion charge, no parking\ncosts. It doesn\u2019t go on strike\nand there\u2019s even room for\nScarlett at the back.\nCharles Betts\nYou\u2019re a bunch of greedy t***ts!\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix FRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY 2010\nFILM\nThe classic teenage-girl webcam shot is aptly recreated in \u00d6stland\u2019s film\nDirector Ruben \u00d6stlund\nScreenwriter Erik Hemmendorg,\nRuben \u00d6stlund\nCast Villmark Bj\u00f6rkman, Linnea CartLamy, Leif Edlund, Sara Erikkson\nInvoluntary\nOliver Calderbank\nWhen a friend asked me to review a film\nas a favour, I (as most people would\nhave) said yes. His way of convincing\nme was \u201cthere are two good-looking\nSwedish girls in\u201d. What my friend\ndidn\u2019t tell me was that the film was rather low budget and had five story lines\nthat didn\u2019t overlap at all.\nThe film in question is a Swedish film\ncalled Involuntary, written and directed\nby Ruben \u04e6stlund. It\u2019s a tragic comedy\nbased on human group behaviour or, to\nput it simply, peer pressure. The film\nconsists of five separate story lines, each\nshowing a situation that most people can\nrelate to or have experienced. There\u2019s\nthe story of a grumpy old man refusing\nhealthcare; a bitchy actress who lets a\nfive year old kid take the fall for an action she committed; two teenage girls\nwho dress provocatively and drink too\nmuch (a critique on the MTV culture we\nlive in); five grown-up men who drink\ntoo much and \u201cexperiment\u201d; and finally,\na story of a teacher who speaks up to\nprevent child abuse and is ostracised by\nher colleagues. Unlike cult classics like\nPulp Fiction or Amores Perros there is\nno overlap between the story lines, each\none stands on its own to make a statement about group pressures.\nThe film draws you in by being so\nrelatable and through \u04e6stlund\u2019s use of\nsubtle directing techniques. His unique\ndirecting style is evident straight away\nas he challenges both himself and the\naudience to interact with and respond to\nthe film. You are drawn in by his choice\nof keeping some characters out of shot,\nallowing you to hear them but never see\ntheir faces, instead focusing on the reaction shots of the main characters. This\ntechnique is highly effective at making\nthe viewer feel more involved.\nWatching the film I felt as though I\ncould draw parallels between myself\nand some characters, making me wonder how differently I act when I want\nto impress a friend or not let someone\ndown. Involuntary will have you stuck\nto your seat, and then leave you questioning your actions and friends. Don\u2019t\nexpect a high budget film with a twist\nat the end, but do expect to have your\nbeliefs challenged.\nI spoke to Ruben \u04e6stlund about his directorial choices and future work:\nWhere do you draw your inspiration?\nThe concept is a thematic film about\ngroup behaviour. I think this is something very fundamental about being a\nhuman being, that we are herd animals.\nI made my first feature, Gitarrmongot [literally: The Guitar Mongoloid]\nabout being individuals that don\u2019t pay\nattention to the group, and while I was\nfor this style?\nFrom the beginning I needed limitations\nfrom which I could draw creative energy and one limitation is to have a fixed\ncamera. With this, the scene could take\nplace in front of the camera or not, so\nI have to make decisions that allow the\nscene to work. In the beginning, I used\nthe fixed camera as a method by which\nI could make the scene\u2019s focus 100% in\nfront of the camera, instead of taking ten\ndifferent angles in the same scene. When\nyou are on set, it takes so much time and\neffort to move the cameras around that\nyou can\u2019t fully focus on what is actually\ngoing on in the scene.\nWhy do you keep people\u2019s heads and\nbodies out of shot?\nI am very interested in the real time aspect that works in film. There are few\nother art forms where the real time aspect is as obvious as it is in film. In shots\nwhere people are off the screen or you\ncan\u2019t see the head, what I\u2019m aiming for\nis to activate the audience, making them\nuse their brains to figure out what is going on. The easiest way to do that is to\nmake something happen off the screen\nso the audience have to work it out\nWhich story line is your favourite?\nI like all of them and I think all of them\nare very important; I wanted all the\ngroups to be very different. A personal\nfavourite may be the storyline on the\nbus, where the actor breaks a curtain,\nand the driver refuses to move any further until whoever did it confesses. It\u2019s\na classic situation where you have a few\nseconds where you can say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m\nsorry \u2013 it was me,\u201d but if you miss that,.\nit becomes harder and harder to confess.\nI think the situation is very universal\nas humans are so afraid of losing face in\nfront of each other, and there are many\ncases in history where people are more\nafraid of losing face than actually dying.\nAn inspiration for this comes from a\nfamous Swedish adventurer called S.A.\nAndr\u00e9e, who, in the 1800s, decided\nto fly by hot air balloon to the North\nPole. Of course, when you look at that\neven today, you would think that\u2019s toA Swedish social commentary\ntally crazy and everyone on the expedition died. But as you read his diaries\nfrom the time you find out that even he\nthought it was doomed to failure but the\nsocial implications of giving up once he\nstarted were so great that he still hopped\nin the balloon, knowing the probable\nconsequences.\nYou started off directing skiing films\nand then went to film school, but how\nwould you advise getting into directing?\nI think the background with skiing was\nvery important for me, because what lots\nof people who want to get into the film\nindustry is for the red carpet and all the\nglamour. When filming skiing, I was a\nfanatic skier so I was pointing the camera towards something I was interested\nin. I think this is the best way to get into\nthe industry because other people decide that they want to be in the industry\nand then have to choose what to point\nthe camera at. If you know what you are\ninterested in, then that is a good start -point the camera in that direction.\nAre there any plans to do English language films?\nMaybe. We are working with a company\ncalled Third and one of their directors,\nDuane Hopkins and it might be that way\nin the future if we can get some money\nfrom the British Film Institute.\nDirector, Ruben \u00d6stland\nInvoluntary will have\nyou questioning your\nactions and friends\n\u201c\ne few\nme as-s-shots\nhots\nr you\nr you\nng for\nng for\nthem\nthem\nis go-go-Involunta\nInvolunta\nyou ques\nyou ques\nAre there a\nAre there\nguage film\nguage film\nMaybe. We\nMaybe. We\ncalled Thir\nThir\nDuane Hop\nne Ho\nin the futur\nn the\nfrom the B\nro\nnds\nnds\nmaking it I got very interested in the\ncomplete opposite, about how the group\ninfluences the way you behave. All the\nfive situations in Involuntary come from\nsituations from my life or other people\nin my life\nYou seem to have a very unique directing style through using long takes from\na stationary camera, is there a reason\n\n"

The standard\nuse of incorporating lenseless frames\nand pretty colours invoked more a cynical eye and left everyone in a state of\nlethargy, which was quickly fixed by a\nsnappy trip to Koko\u2019s swanky and (rela-tively) reasonably-priced bar.\nOf Montreal\u2019s anticipated opening\nwas a bizarre contrast of the eerie and\nthe energetic (think Willy Wonka\u2019s\n\u2018Pure Imagination\u2019 meets Justice\u2019s\nA playlist from...\nBusiness Editor\nAfonso Campos\nBusiness by day, dancing\nqueen by night: my man Fonzie\nwill float your boat any time of\nday.\nIslandsRough Gem\nNew OrderAge of Consent\nIggy PopReal Wild Child\nThe Black KeysI Got Mine\nDavid BowieLet\u2019s Dance\nAriel PinkInteresting Results\nSlow ClubGiving Up On Love\nElton JohnMona Lisas and Mad\nHatters\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist send\nit in to music.felix@gmail.\ncom\nA plethora of reviews from\nbrand spanking new writers!\n\u2018Genesis\u2019), as the band were joined on\nstage by some kind of aquatic abomination before front man Kevin Barnes\nbounded on stage in a frilly tutu and\nbelted \u2018Coquet Coquette\u2019, one of False\nPriest\u2019s better efforts. It\u2019s brilliant when\nan act can maintain such enthusiasm\nfrom the audience by ingeniously weaving those old forgotten classics amongst\nthe heap of new material that they\u2019re trying to sell, which is exactly what they\ndid to perfection.\nThe set was more like a theatrical per-formance, what with all of the confetti,\nkitsch decor and on-stage body painting\nsessions. But let us not forget the music\nitself; there wasn\u2019t the all too common\nincreasing of the tempo, and the band really interacted with one another as well\nas the audience in a special kind of way.\nIt was particularly interesting to see obviously more personal, emotive melodies written by Barnes being engaged\nin by the other band members to such\na degree, and the epic 11\u2013minute \u2018The\nPast is a Grotesque Animal\u2019 is one of the\nmost fantastic encores I\u2019ve had the pleasure of witnessing.\nAll in all, a brilliant performance from\na talented group who will never fail to\nmesmerise. Be sure to check out their\nlatest album \u2018False Priest\u2019 as well as\n\u2018Hissing Fauna\u2019 from their extensive\nback catalogue (and catch them live if\nyou can!).\nBatshit crazy psychadelic-rock outfit Of Montreal lay waste to\nKoko, in a haze of theatrics and musical mastery.\nWilder\nSkyful of Rainbows\nRough Trade\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nIn the dark and cramped backroom of\neast London\u2019s favourite bar, 93 Feet\nEast the slips are running late. The\nsmell of sweat and overpriced red\nstripe hangs in the air but the crowd\nseems undeterred, jostling about and\nexpectant to see whether the self titled \u2018electro renegades\u2019 will live up to\nsuch a claim.From the moment they\ntake the stage, the lights are off and\nthe silence broken as pulsing electronica punctures the darkness. While\nthe two front men alternate between\nsinging and thrashing their macbooks,\nthe drummer curls over and manically\nassaults the kit in front of him.\nOur ears are treated to a range of remixes including Daft Punk and Crystal\nFighter\u2019s \u2018 I love london\u2019 which from\nthe crowds cheers, they evidently make\ntheir own. But the best is to follow as\nthe trio dive into their science inspired\ntrack \u20184 elements\u2019. As the speakers spit\njustice-inspired noise, images of DNA\nand the periodic table flash behind\nthem, they must have known imperial\nstudents were coming.\nAs the set comes to a close I wonder\nwhether 3rd down the list is fair, the\nslips seem set to steal the night from\nunder the nose of headline act Cassette Jam and a look to the front confirms it, even the hipsters can be seen\ndancing: they must be on to a winner.\n\u2018Skyful of Rainbows\u2019, Wilder\u2019s\nnew single, does not sound anything like the Fleet Foxes as their\nlabel would have you believe. Instead they\u2019re more akin to chirpy\nKlaxons ripoffs. Betting on the\ncurrent syth revival (thank you La\nRoux), the song has an energetic\nriff built over a robotic chorus that\nculminates into a finale that would\nbe fitting for any club. However,\nthe same clich\u00e9d angle in the lyrics,\nwhich held so much promise with\nits quirky title, relagates it to chart\nfodder.

Formed by members of\nbands like ISIS, Neurosis and Pelican,\nthe direction and aesthetic is predictable.\nGroups described as post-metal tend to\nhave long instrumental focused compositions that lean towards the nastier and\ndirtier textures. What makes them such a\nwonderful listen, unlike your traditional\ndreary post-rock outfit, is the songwrit-ing, as Red Sparowes construct songs by\namalgamating catchy middle 8s with an\nundercurrent of meaningful direction.\nThe average song ends precisely when\nyou want it to. Consequently, you may\nnot remember the song\u2019s title, but you\nRed Sparowes\nLa Scala, King\u2019s Cross\n11th October 2010\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nNiraj Patel\nwill remember each distinct journey. I\ndaresay they are a much more graceful\nband than those mentioned earlier.\nThe gig itself was nicely orchestrated,\nstarting with heavier numbers from their\nfirst two albums, \u2018At The Soundless\nDawn\u2019 and \u2018Every Red Heart Shines Towards the Sun\u2019. I\u2019d quote song titles, but\nthey tend to be overwrought sentences.\nFluidly switching between a three electric guitar attack and a pedal steel guitar\nassisted by piano setup, the band never\nbored. When playing the newer mate-rial, which I wasn\u2019t familiar with, I got a\nchance to focus on the the visuals and I\nwas very, very impressed.\nIt would\u2019ve been easy for the band to\nslap together predictable natural imag-ery, but the wide range of images kept\nthe audience on their toes and in fact\nposed a lot of questions regarding the\nsongs. While never forcing a picture or\ntheme into my mind, they merely sug-Red Sparowes hypnotized by a giant eye: trippy as shit\ngested and teased the potential context\nof a song\u2019s meaning. Since they don\u2019t\nplay with a click track or a tightly syn-chronised video feed, there was no clich\u00e9 editing to fit the song\u2019s tempo. As a\nresult, it felt very very organic. All in all,\nthe video meant I was kept thoroughly\ndrawn in during songs I had never heard\nbefore, which is a massive accomplish-ment.\nRed Sparowes may not jump out in\nlists of music recommendations, neither\nwill they set the world on fire, but they\nare brilliant at what they do. If post-rock\ngeeks want a barometer, I had more fun\nthat night than I ever did at a Mogwai\nor Explosions in the Sky concert. That\nsays it all.\n\n"

There is slightly more groove to\nbe found in \u2018Heathen Child\u2019 but raucous guitars are\nstill prowling in the choruses to shake things up. It\nis far from a one dimensional album however; respite from the noise can be found in songs like the\ndelicate \u2018What I Know\u2019 and the upbeat \u2018Palaces of\nMontezuma\u2019.

Suddenly, they found themselves\nbefore an enormous stage, stunned, and they\nlooked up to see a dancing woman projected\nabove their heads. Her colourful legs parted as\na figure appeared from the screen, who rolled\nfrom the stage in an oversized hamster ball over\nthe heads of the wide-eyed, bushy-tailed rabbits\nand into a crowd filled with creatures from elves\nand unicorns to genies and caterpillars. One\ncaterpillar enticed the bunnies, and Flipsy and\nFlopsy started to dance under a rainbow that descended above their long bunny ears. Their blue\neyes glittered in amazement at the striped tents\nthat towered above their little heads, and they\nbounced for joy like never before. They had\nstumbled into Bestival as The Flaming Lips\nbegan the journey of their unforgettable perfor-mance, for if this was anywhere else I would\nhave discarded their story as myth.\nThe Flaming Lips gave Bestival goers an experience which was as beautiful as it was confusing and as colourful as it was loud. They raced\nthrough their psychedelic minds and unleashed\nthe musical accompaniment unto us, blowing\naway everything in front of the stage with a whirlwind of emotion. Through fuzzy riffs, distorted\nvoices, and numerous animal impressions, The\nFlaming Lips opened their parachute of \u2018Do You\nRealise?\u2019and brought the entire crown softly gliding back to Earth, not one without a smile.\nFlipsy and Flopsy bunny-jived their way over\nto the Wishing Tree and Chai Wallah tent\u2019s miraculous mixing and beats that could shift tectonic plates. Stumbling over a rabbit hole, they\ndecided to venture down, popping up in a magical meadow. This was actually the Magic Meadow whereAlice in Wonderland figures dotted the\npathways, and the Rock and Roll stage showcased New Young Pony Club, Mount Kimbies and the amazing Lizzie. Playing endearing\nAmericana style rock folk, Lizzie had everyone\nclinging to the \u2018sustain\u2019 of her electric guitar.\nFeeling energetic, they scampered as fast as\ntheir little bunny legs would take them up a hill\nand into the woods where tiny tents played big\nmusic as people skiffled to the beat, in the most\nrelaxed and colourful area of Bestival. Sculptures snuggled between trees, free tea and cakes\nwere abundant and the stars were clearly dancing above above their heads; the two bunnies\nhad to stop to take it all in.\nStanding over a twinkling view of the whole\nof Bestival, Flipsy and Flopsy lovingly joined\nhands and at that very instant an enormous gust\nof wind swept them from the hillside, up into\nthe air, and down onto the Arcadia stage. Shit\njust got serious. With sets from Darwin Deez\nand Todd Edwards, this stage was so full of\nmovement and energy that from time to time\nfire erupted from a giant metallic spider which\nencased the stage itself.\nFlipsy and Flopsy\u2019s experience of Bestival\ncontinued with The Prodigy following up after\nChase and Status on the main stage with brilliant energy, despite performing the same set\nthey have done for years. However a real highlight were the Wailers, with their endless summertime good vibes, reeling off Marley hits and\nlifting everyone to high spirits. The xx, having\njust won the Mercury Prize, performed flawlessly despite the overpopulated Big Top tent. The\nBig Top tent also revealed to the adventurous\nrabbits the likes of Skream, Jonsi, Fever Ray\nand the riot fuelled LCD Soundsystem, all of\nwhich broke bones, hearts and vocal chords, giving Bestival everything it could have wished for.\nStrolling out of Caribou\u2019s set would have exposed a huge firework display above a flaming\ncastle, spreading the magic to the sky as everyone congregated together in a final showdown\nof the fantastic and wonderful versus the world.\nThese two rabbits had learned an awful lot in\nsuch a small space of time; they were so happy\nthat they decided that they would hop and hop\nand spread the love they had gained at Bestival\nknowing full well that there was enough love\nthere to last a lifetime.\n\u201cIf this was anywhere\nelse I would have\ndiscarded their story as\nmyth\u201d\nLuke Turner\nAnother fantastic\nyear for Bestival\nThe sun in your eyes, everything is slightly blurred, strange drum circle; yep this photo sums up Bestival\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 15 October 2010\n26\nEach year a group of intrepid Fellwanderers\nleave the UK to undertake an ambitious two\nweek trek overseas. This year was no different.\nThe chosen trek was the breathtaking Tour of\nthe Jungfrau, winding its way among some of\nthe most spectacular and best-loved mountain\nscenery in the Swiss Alps.\nThe circular trek took the group through the\nBernese Oberland\u2019s most spectacular mountain\nscenery, in the shadow of such iconic peaks as\nthe Wetterhorn, Monch, Eiger, and Jungfrau\nfinally summiting the iconic Schilthorn at the\nend of the route\nThe start of the real hiking was from Schynige Platte, which was accessible by mountain\nrailway so we stayed the first night a little lower\ndown at Wilderswil. Tired from the long journey and early morning, we went to bed early,\nexcited about getting the real walking the next\nday. So the next day, we got the mountain railway up to Schynige Platte. On the way back, we\nactually saw the mountain railway come apart\nas it left the station so we appear to have been\nquite lucky in not encountering problems. On\nthe first day, we walked from Schynige Platte to\nFirst via the Faulhorn (2686m). We walked the\nlast 40 minutes in ridiculously heavy rain and\nthen got to the hut. As we were cooking dinner,\nJim had the first porridge spillage disaster of\nthe trip \u2013 his bag of porridge had come open\nand the rain had mixed with it to form porridge.\nIt stuck to all his stuff and the hallway when he\nemptied his bag out.\nThe next day was lovely and warm, and\nwe walked from First to Grindewald, a valley town. On this walk we really started to get\nour first views of the amazing mountains we\nwere going to see throughout the two weeks.\nWe walked past the Wetterhorn and were heading down to the valley. At this point, Jim, Joe,\nAnde and Ben decided to extend the walk to\nthe Gleckstein Hut (2317m). Treading in the\nfootsteps of Winston Churchill (who used the\nhut as a base to summit the Wetterhorn), they\ntraversed up steep-sided slopes above a gorge\nbefore emerging into a high alpine valley in\nwhich the hut lay. Here, Ande\u2019s coke addiction was satisfied as they were rewarded with\nthe first view from within the high alps of the\nfirst days of the tour. However (and this will\nbecome an emerging theme) I decided on the\neasier option and walked down the valley to the\ncampsite.\nWe originally just planned to stay the night at\nGrindewald but after much discussion we decided to stay at the campsite for an extra day,\nthe justifications being we could eat more food,\ntherefore carry less up the mountain, and there\nwas more to do in Grindewald than Alpiglen\nin terms of rest day fun. Jim, Joe (these two\ndidn\u2019t actually have a rest day for the whole\ntrip!) Ande and Ben decided to attempt to reach\nnew heights by ascending to another hut lying\nnext to a glacier at 2800m. After a very precipitous ascent, they were forced to turn back some\n200m from the top due to worsening weather\nconditions in the face of a tough climb up rocks.\nThe rest of us learnt crazy dominoes, courtesy\nof Rafal. He won\u2026 Coincidence? I think not.\nBut then Yvonne and I beat Peter and Rafal at\nbowls. So balance was restored, despite (false)\nallegations of witchcraft. That evening Chris\narrived and we watched a World Cup match on\nthe TV at the campsite.\nSo the next day we went to Alpiglen, taking\nus out of the valley. We got there just before\nlunch, ate lunch and got shown into a lovely\nhut. It wasn\u2019t so lovely the next morning when\nwe were woken up by flies at 3 in the morning.\nThat night I was introduced to President, the\ncard game with a player hierarchy that actively\nencourages social inequality by making it almost impossible to get out of the peasant role\nonce you\u2019re there.\nThe next day we walked on to Kleine Schliedegg, past Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau. Jim,\nPeter, Joe and Ande bravely \u201cclimbed\u201d all of\n3 feet of the North Face of the Eiger. We then\n\u201cAfter a very precipitous\nascent, they were forced\nto turn back some\n200m from the top due\nto worsening weather\nconditions in the face of\na tough climb up rocks.\nThe rest of us learnt\ncrazy dominoes\u201d\nSarah Martin\nTREKKING\nINTHE\nALPS\nFellwanderers are up\nto their usual antics\nincluding experiencing\nsome of Europe\u2019s most\nstunning scenery\nRaise your hands and give a cheer!\nRaising and Giving (RAG) is here!\nRAG at Imperial and in\ngeneral in the UK is\nwell established within the student body.

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX\nFriday 15 October 2010\n32\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\nfter the initial excitement of\nWelcome Week, the thrill of being asked to \u2018down it, fresher\u2019\nwears a bit thin and suddenly\nthe simple act of increasing your\nblood alcohol level beyond reasonable limits\nbecomes tedious. Today\u2019s would-be wasters\nneed flashing lights, sound effects and the thrill\nof adrenaline to keep them interested, but if\ndisgusting clubs don\u2019t tickle your fancy what\nother option do you have?\nThe solution comes from Cardiff-based company \u2018Games&Gadgets\u2019 in the form of \u2018Lucky\nEscape\u2019, their flagship electronic drinking\ngame that\u2019s a mix between roulette, Trivial Pursuit and downing shots. Glasses are filled with\ndifferent drinks and placed into a special circular tray, with each glass corresponding to a light\non a central podium. When a big, inviting red\nbutton is pressed the lights spin and flash, eventually slowing down to seal your fate: should a\nglass be lit up by the flashing board you must\ndown it, but should the central light be lit the\ngame has offered you redemption in the form of\na question. Get it right and you\u2019re safe but get\nit wrong and you must spin again. We got our\ngrubby mitts on a copy of \u2018Lucky Escape\u2019 and\nthought that, obviously in the name of science\nand fair review or whatever, we should have a\ngo at it ourselves.\nWith the lights suitably dimmed, the first\npleasant surprise was how pretty the game\nlooked when switched on. With the red, green\nand yellow lights softly lighting the sweet liquids in the tumblers, the black and green plastic\ntray suddenly took on a new, sophisticated ambience that would fit right in at a classy party\nas well as slightly less urbane drinks sessions.\nNow that everything was ready, all that was\nrequired was a volunteer to go first. Initially\npeople seemed a little intimidated and the usual\nparty conversation was worryingly absent.\nEventually though a plucky Northerner stepped\nup and tried his luck. As the lights span and\nthe game clicked like the roulette wheel it was\nsimulating, the room was genuinely tense. The\nlights ground to a halt and we were met with\ngreen flashing and a fanfare. He\u2019d got relatively\nlucky with the \u2018nicest\u2019drink \u2013 in our case, some\nsherry. While sober, the sound effects did grate\nagainst our nerves, but once we\u2019d had a bit to\ndrink it didn\u2019t seem to matter as much. One\nthing that became apparent very quickly was\nhow large the shot glasses provided with the\ngame are; downing one full cup would\u2019ve sent\na significant quantity of liquid down the hatch.\nEven our resident boozehound (he\u2019s a Medic,\nso he knows what he\u2019s talking about) described\nthe size of the glasses as \u2018gutsy\u2019, and the game\nwould hugely benefit from smaller glasses that\nheld more manageable amounts of liquid.\nAfter the first few spins the atmosphere became more relaxed and the game was definitely a focal point of the evening. Although\nconversation continued whilst the board was\nmaking up it\u2019s mind (as it should) people kept\npaying attention to what was happening. When\nthe wheel landed on red \u2013 the \u2018nastiest\u2019 drink\nwhich in our case was straight Southern Comfort \u2013 there were laughs at the expense of the\nunfortunate player and when the result came up\ngreen or yellow there were some similar inhalations of mutual relief.\nOne aspect that has yet to be touched upon is\nthe role that questions play in \u2018Lucky Escape\u2019,\nand that\u2019s because it took two complete rounds\nfor the game to even try asking us any. Instead,\nmuch like some of the creepier inhabitants of\nImperial College, the game seemed to be trying\nto get us drunk before it took things any further.\nOnce we were ready though questions came\nregularly and were actually quite challeng-ing, rewarding players who had kept their wits\nabout them. \u2018James Bond\u2019s favourite drink\u2019and\n\u2018the country associated with Sambuca\u2019 were\ntwo pieces of knowledge demanded of us and,\nbeing inebriated, the answers got to the tip of\nour tongues but no further.\nWe managed a handful of rounds of \u2018Lucky\nEscape\u2019 before the game finally fell down due\nto a need for organisation. Drinks need to be\ntopped up semi-regularly and some people\nfound huge chalices of Southern Comfort a bit\nmuch to take in one gulp and so held on to their\nglasses long after their turn. Eventually we\nall decided to call it a day, but the game had\nserved it\u2019s purpose and it had done so admira-bly. Although while sober \u2018Lucky Escape\u2019 initially seemed a bit mediocre, once a few rounds\nhad been played and a few drinks have been\ndowned it did quite well at entertaining us and\nproduced some genuinely hilarious moments.\nBooze away the boredom\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless specifically mentioned\nto the contary you\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash\nPlayer plug-in which can be installed from http://get.\nadobe.com/flashplayer/.\nDepict1\ntinyurl.com/depict1\nIn this retro platformer you control a small boy lost\nin a world of invisible walls, infinite pits and shadowy\nenemies. Led by a mysterious narrator whose advice\nis not as helpful as it initially might seem, you and the\nboy must journey in the hope of finding some escape\ndespite the narrator insisting that there is none to be\nfound. Depict1 turns a lot of the traditional staples\nof video games, such as spiky pits, bonus diamonds\nand timed levels, on their head and forces the player to re-examine everything they thought they knew\nabout platformers. After a few levels there comes\na feeling that the entire game is both unpredictable\nand out to get you which makes for an original and\nexciting experience. The adrenaline is kept high by\nthe constant suspicious thoughts about what might\nhappen next, and even working out how to move is a\nchallenge in itself.\nBacked up by some pretty graphics that give the\ngame a professional polish, Depict1 is a game that\ngrabs hold of you and won\u2019t let go until the end, despite some slow levels early on. There are two endings to be found, one significantly harder than the\nother, and the final level is a genuine stumper that\nmight take you a while to figure out. Go to the web-site, click Depict1 and then follow the links to the\nFlash version on the right.\nGame developer Blizzard, who are most famous for their massively multiplayer online\ngame World Of Warcraft, have been discovered\nto be handing out suspensions to offline players of their real-time strategy game Starcraft 2.\nPlayers were handed both temporary and permanent bans after being found to be using third\nparty programs whilst playing the single-player\ncampaign or skirmish matches. The story was\nbroken by CheatHappens.com whose members\nwere subject to bans that, in some, cases left\ntheir CD keys permanently disabled.\nThe action taken by Blizzard is unusual as\nsuspension from a gaming service is normally\nonly given out as a punishment to hackers in\nonline multiplayer. Although critics have questioned the legality of the bans, the terms are\nclear in the Starcraft 2 EULA that the developers have \u201cthe right to ban your battle.net account and/or CD key from ever playing again,\nonline or off\u201d.\nWe contacted Blizzard directly and received\nno comment in response to their action, but\nfrom what can be learned from press releases\nand replies to appeals, Blizzard seems to have\ntaken the view that as \u2018achievements\u2019 can be\nunlocked in single player there is a good reason\nto ban players who try to gain them unfairly,\neven though not all cheat programs are used for\nthis reason. Some players like to use \u2018trainers\u2019\nto make the game easier or just for messing\naround, and these players have also felt the effects of the famous Blizzard BanHammer.\nReaction from the StarCraft 2 community\nhas been mixed. Some regard the action as\ncompletely justified and have \u201ccheered on the\nbans\u201d, whereas others have reacted angrily and\nhave even called for a boycott of the game. \u201cAs\nlong as these cheats don\u2019t affect anyone but the\nperson using them, why does anyone care?\u201d\nsays CheatHappens.com editor Chris O\u2019Rorke,\nechoing similar arguments by other players as\nto why the bans are unjustified. Some question\nthe severity of the punishment, suggesting that\nsimply removing achievements from cheating\nplayers would be a less objectionable solution.\nAffected players have little option but to sit\nout the suspension or to shell out more money\nfor a new copy of the game in the case of a\npermanent ban. Increasing numbers also seem\nto be turning to piracy, which allows play of the\nsingle-player campaign for free. Banned layers\nwho wish to appeal are advised to contact Blizzard directly and be prepared for a long, drawn-out exchange will probably be unsuccessful.\nWhat happens when you take drinking to the next level\nBlizzard bans single-player hackers\nSimon Worthington\nOnly thing Felix writers are good for\nEvery time you do, this guy secretly laughs at you\nGET FREE STUFF!\nWe\u2019ve got sixteen copies of \u2018Lucky Escape\u2019\nto give away!

    "content": "30\nFILM\nfelix\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY 2010\n!Felix likes this...\nThe Social Network may just be the movie that\ndefines our generation. It tackles a subject that\ncertainly defined our generation \u2013 Facebook \u2013\nand after barely a month in the cinemas, critics\nalready call it a classic. What\u2019s the fuss about?\nFor one, it\u2019s directed by David Fincher, a\nfamiliar name in smart cult movies (Fight\nClub) and Oscar heavy weights (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). In addition to\nthat, the screenwriting comes from scriptwriter\nextraordinaire Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing,\nA Few Good Men). Based on Ben Mezrich\u2019s\nbestseller, The Accidental Billionaires, the film\ntrails the rise of Mark Zuckerberg from frustrated college nerd to the youngest billionaire\non Earth, and the genesis of a social platform\nthat revolutionized the way we communicate\nwith each other.\nIt is, as Fincher puts it, a Citizen Kane of our\nera. There certainly are parallels between The\nSocial Network and the \u2018greatest movie of all\ntime\u2019. Both depict the meteoric rise of a controversial figure after founding an empire. Both\nfigures soon \u2013 like a meteor \u2013 burn their closest friends and those who helped them reach\nsuch heights. And both end up at the top of the\nworld, alone.\nThe heroes of both films are based on real\npeople. Though Orson Welles\u2019 movie is a film\n\u00e0 clef, The Social Network deals with the man\nhimself, Mark Zuckerberg, albeit a fictionalized version. As scriptwriter Sorkin put it in a\nNew York Magazine interview: \u201cI don\u2019t want\nmy fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to\nstorytelling\u201d. And it is storytelling at its finest.\nThe Social Network is a contemporary tale of\nfriendship, jealousy, betrayal and \u2013 above all\n\u2013 ambition. It is an epic modern mythos, exploring the most fundamental and everlasting\nthemes in storytelling.\nZuckerberg himself voiced his reservations\nof the film prior to its release. \u201cI wish that no\none made a movie about me when I was alive,\u201d\nhe said in a recent interview. Flattering though\nit may seem, to have a biopic released whilst\nyou are not just still alive but a mere twenty-six, Zuckerberg does have reasons to fear for\nhis reputation. His reputation took a double\nbeating this year when Silicon Alley Insider\ntwice leaked IM logs detailing a darker (or\nrather, more adolescent) side of Mark when he\nfirst founded Facebook.\nIt is Zuckerberg\u2019s own \u2018FuckGate\u2019, revealing that he called early Facebook users \u201cdumb\nfucks\u201d and his plan to deal with rival Harvard\nConnection \u2013 whose creators later sued Zuckerberg, accusing him of appropriating their\nideas for Facebook \u2013 was to \u201cfuck them\u201d. He\nsubsequently apologised for this in a recent\ninterview with The New Yorker. With the new\nfilm depicting him as a rule-breaking rebel\nand prompting new questions about the claim,\nZuckerberg is understandably not too happy,\nespecially after the out-of-court settlement of\n$65 million to the founders of Harvard Connection, the Winklevoss twins.\nFortunately for Zuckerberg, however, the\nmovie actually does not portray him in such a\nway that would damage his fragile reputation\nfurther. Based mostly on Aaron Sorkin\u2019s own\nDirector David Fincher\nScreenwriter Aaron Sorkin\nCast Jesse Eisenberg, Rooney Mara,\nJustin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield\nThe Social Network\nGuo Heng Chin\nresearch, the Zuckerberg of the film is a tour\nde force of a character and may go down as\none of the most iconic anti-heroes in modern\ncinema. He is highly intelligent and extremely\nself-assured, yet he craves social validity and is\nhurt the most by social rejection.\nAn embodiment of \u2018the geek shall inherit\nthe Earth\u2019, he affronts people on the basis of\nhis intellectual capability. He is not socially\nawkward, but rather lacks fundamental social\nempathy in a borderline Asperger\u2019s way. This\nsometimes comes across as endearingly good,\nbut mostly just leaves a trail of pissed-off peo-ple. Zuckerberg is a Byronic hero for the Internet age, a visionary genius who, despite changing the social world, is himself socially flawed.\nJesse Eisenberg (Zombieland) brings to life\na complex protagonist with many conflicting\ncharacteristics. His portrayal of Zuckerberg\npossesses a subtle undercurrent of sensitivity\namidst his social stoicism, and reminds us that,\nthough genius, he is still human.\nAndrew Garfield\u2019s (Never Let Me Go) performance of Mark\u2019s BFF is haunting. His\ngradual but inevitable progression from Mark\u2019s\nconfidante to victim of Mark\u2019s ambition is especially heart wrenching. Justin Timberlake\n(Alpha Dogs, Shrek Forever After) sweeps the\ntable as the charismatic silicon valley playboy\nand Zuckerberg\u2019s idol Sean Parker, who much\nto Saverin\u2019s dismay, would soon become Facebook\u2019s first president. Ironically, the role\nthat would define the acting career of one of\nthe most successful male musician in the world\nwould be that of the founder of Napster.\nFincher\u2019s superbly stylish cinematography\ncaptures the audience in a surreal ride with\nZuckerberg. Sorkin\u2019s script is genius of its\nown, with top notch lines and bashing wit.\nThe Social Network is going to be big at the\nOscars, launch the careers of its young stars\nand might just go down in history as the film\nthat defined the cinema of our time.\nThe Zuckerberg of the\nfilm is a tour de force of\na character\nThe Zuc\nThe Zuc\nfilm is a\nfilm is a\n\u201d\ntelling at its finest.\nling at its finest.\nntemporary tale of\nntemporary tale of\none\ncin\ncin\nself\nself\nhur\nhur\nA\nA\nthe\nt\nhis\nde force of\nforce of\nClassic Cinema\nBack To The Future is re-released\nto celebrate its 25th Anniversary\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start when writing a review\nof a childhood favourite film. I think in all embarrassing truthfulness, the reason I love the Back to the\nFuture films so much is because when I was very\nyoung we had Back to the Future III on Sega Mega\nDrive and I used to love watching my older brother\nand sister complete the incredibly difficult (and even\nthen I seem to remember, wholly infidelitous to the\nplot) final level on the train. Admittedly the reason\nI loved it was because it had a train in it, and as a\nsmall boy I was a massive train geek, but I\u2019ve heard\nof worse reasons for liking a film: like watching Dune\nbecause you fancy Sting.\nAs films get older: their captive childhood audiences become adults with money to spend and\nwistful memories; their VHSs become obsolete or\nbroken (not to mention their Sega Mega Drives); and\ntheir creators become old enough to either need the\nmoney without bothering to produce a new film, or\nto no longer be able to fight off speculative distributors who want a guaranteed money-maker. Thus, to\nthis cynical old soul, the Re-issue is born. Luckily it\nhas avoided having the 3D treatment currently being\nforced upon the original Star Wars trilogy.\nI am frankly foaming at the mouth with excitement at the thought of going to see it, even though\nI wouldn\u2019t say that I am a complete B2TF nut. Although, now I think about it, I do have the official\nsoundtrack on vinyl LP but that\u2019s only because I saw\nit in a charity shop for \u00a31.50. Oh and I have four\npairs of Nike airforce ones simply because Marty\nwears them; and that before said trainer became\nfashionable over here I had to order them from the\nUS. And I know exactly the point in Part Two where\nyou can see the five-year old Elijah Wood on screen.\nAnd that the Amplifier in the beginning of Part One\nis called a CRM-114, in homage to Kubrick\u2019s \u201cDr.\nStrangelove\u201d. Also the first song i ever learnt on\nguitar was Johnny B Goode. So yeah I\u2019m a massive\nB2TF nut. I\u2019ve even watched Backsides to the Future,\ndespite usually steering clear of novelty porn films.\nI said at the beginning that it\u2019s hard to know where\nto start when reviewing a beloved children\u2019s film, and\nI\u2019ve realised I haven\u2019t even done that, just rattled off\nmy favourite moments. All I can really say is that,\nseeing those Oscar-winning-but-naff 80\u2019s special effects on the big screen they were made for will tide\nme over for childish glee quite comfortably until the\nHarry Potters come blasting our way at Christmas.\nJustin \u201cDick-in-a-Box\u201d Timberlake lends his gravitas to David Fincher\u2019s biopic-drama\nAn accurate representation of the EEE department\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "41\nfelix FRIDAY 15 OCTOBER 2010\nSPORT\na goal from Felch-Phallus. Confusion between\nMarc-Vivien Lobb\u00e9 and Dirk Kunt at the back led\nto the ex-pats taking the lead again before Huvely\nreceived the ball and was able to whip it into the\ncorner to equalize. IC saw out another 2-2 draw\ntaking it to penalties. Unfortunately Penetration 0\nand AIDS bottled their big moments and the victory\nwent to Celtic.\nA trip to both Morrison\u2019s 1 and 2 ensued, with\nboth clubs infested with skirt. In Morrison\u2019s 1 Dirk\nKunt made good friends with the local ditch pig,\ndutifully taking in all the things she said, whilst\nKernkraft 400 returned to the hostel to have a dig in\nthe whiskers of one of the staff under the watchful\neye of Earthworm Jim. Over in Morrison\u2019s 2 Maly\nPenis was having a psychedelic yawn in each of the\ntoilets whilst Huvely was living up to his name and\nattracting all manner of men. Earthworm Jim Del\nBoy-ed through a door, leaving him lying in the\ngrot while a bemused Hungarian looked on pitiful-ly. Penetration 0 almost became Penetration 1 with\na high-calibre young female, though it all went to\nshit soon after as a nosebleed interrupted his prog-ress. Susan Boyle had no such problems however\nas his Last Throw of the Dice tactics paid dividends\ndown a dark alley.\nThe final beautiful day in Budapest was brought\nin with the discovery of a bollard accrued by Gary\nGlitter and the contents of a man\u2019s wallet obtained\nby Muhammed. The Hungarian sister of Paper Tiger\nwas visited, though Papier Tigris failed to live up to\nthe high onion-ridden standards of its South Kensington equivalent. The third game of tour against a\nlocal Irish team took place that evening and began\nwell with goals from Bola Bola Loser Cunt, Susan\nBoyle and Velezzeraptor giving IC a 3-1 lead. IC\n\u201c\n\u201d\nWith an exponential\nincrease in the protection provided by their\nsuncream, the pasty\nEnglishmen took in the\nremarkable view and\nleft the local fizzing at\nthe bunghole\ncontrived to throw the match away, either distracted\nby the middle aged Hungarian woman doing hula\nhoops on the touchline or the tactical ineptitude of\nthe manager, with the game finishing 5-3.\nThat night the party visited the island, though\nthe clubs were empty and Velezzeraptor resorted to\nstealing a bike to ride around \u2013 a fetish he would\nlater revisit. Everyone returned to Rumkert, site\nof an excellent night a few days earlier, where\nKernkraft 400 received some painful friction burns\nfrom a toothy young maiden called Fanny. Scatman continued his lairy adventures and, along with\nLobb\u00e9 and AIDS, was comfortably dispatched by\nthe Hungarian Kimbo Slice.\nThe travelling pack of airborne rangers then made\ntheir way to their second destination on the Danube\nby means of a train - their first contact on tour with\nsomething older than Marc-Vivien Lobb\u00e9. Having taken seats in 6 man booths, they proceeded to\ndrink the bar dry. Cockles and his dutiful assistant\nVelezzeraptor obliged. Having already purchased\n3 bunches of heather for the journey, Velezzeraptor decided to donate these and one free ticket to\nhis premier streaking performance to the huvely in\nhis booth. Momo Sissoko and Emmanuel Petit put\nin noteworthy performances as we arrived at our\nhostel.\nSlovakian Bar One was the setting for the first\ndinner in Bratislava, and luckily for Bola Bola Loser Cunt they were able to serve Hawaiian pizzas\nwithout the pineapple. Velezzeraptor, fresh from\nhis role as bar assistant, was now undertaking the\nduties of toilet cleaner as he missed his call on the\nbig white telephone. Scatman and Huvely\u2019s date\nbore no fruit as both decided their crockery made\nfor suitable pillows, much to the waitress\u2019 disgust.\nNu Spirit was the venue of choice for the rest of\nthe evening\u2019s events, as 90c beers and deep house\neased the Rangers into the early hours. Leroy\nLighter and Hartlepool United gave pleasing performances with Velezzeraptor bearing his chest in\ncelebration. Susan Boyle was so overwhelmed he\nwas required to reboot. Earthworm Jim\u2019s request\nfor a lady to reveal her Jabulanis was met with con-tempt, as was the follow up appeal for her to play\nhis vuvuzela. Marc-Vivien Lobb\u00e9 was simply content with a pint of milk. Muhammed and Penetration 0 had earlier split from the group and were now\nin the company of Slovakian international Martin\nSkrtel, fresh from his side\u2019s loss to Holland in the\nsecondary football event of the summer.\nThursday yielded no scheduled game for IC, so a\nmajority made their way to a local lake. Velezzeraptor, again, cycled. With an exponential increase\nin the protection provided by their sun cream, the\npasty Englishmen took in the remarkable view and\nleft the local talent fizzing at the bunghole. A few\nlooked to emulate the antics of Andrew Flintoff by\nhiring pedalos, whilst others were content to bask\nin the glorious 30 degree heat and densely packed\nSlovakian fuzz. Earthworm Jim\u2019s nipple hair provided light relief, as did Brown the Down\u2019s retarded doggy paddle.\nAs the evening rolled in, those who had disregarded their tie when deciding on essential items\nfor tour were suitably reprimanded. As lesser men\nstruggled, Evan Davies stood tall and in the valley of the blind, the one eyed man was King. Gary\nGlitter, unable to regurgitate his reprimand, decided\nthe most honourable method to achieve such would\nbe to neck another beer. Belliot Gaylord remained\nfirmly tucked in his arsehole. Velezzeraptor had\nsomehow agreed to buy a live chicken for the paltry sum of 12 euros. With a flick knife for guar-antee, the raptor sat awaiting his livestock. With\nEvan Davies now tucked up in bed with a Polish\nman the group were kicking up a storm in another\nclub called Rio. Dave brought his special brand\nof French romance to the table by going bareback\non a girl\u2019s arm. Maly Penis, having been involved\nin a disagreement with a particularly large Slovakian club-goer, took evasive action by inverting his\nwhite t-shirt. The Black Plague, historically caused\nby rats, was now in hot pursuit of one and was left\nbehind as Maly Penis\u2019 cunning disguise allowed\nthe group to safely evacuate the dancefloor. Even\na slap of encouragement from Susan Boyle and\nBuckaroo to the buttocks of The Black Plague\u2019s\naforementioned rat gave rise to no further incident\nin the evening. The same, though, could not be said\nfor Bill and Ben. The innocent flower pot men were\nravaged by AIDS and bought to an untimely demise\non the backstreets of Bratislava.\nFriday brought IC\u2019s last touring match against\nKPMG Bratislava. IC started typically slowly,\nwith the robust KPMG side bossing the midfield.\nThe score remained 0-0 only due to excellent goal-keeping from Dave. A break down the right from\nMaly Penis saw him awarded a penalty. The Black\nPlague stood up to take the spot kick and proceeded\nto tamely knock the ball into the keeper\u2019s hands.\nKPMG gained impetus from this and by half time\nwere 1-0 to the good. A rousing team talk from Huvely saw an inspired IC team take complete control\nof the second half and they were soon 3-1 ahead\nthanks to a low strike from Scatman and Ronaldinho-esque cross-shots from Maly Penis and Brown\nthe Down. IC survived a late surge from KPMG to\ncome out of the game with a 3-2 victory, their first\nof the tour.\nIt being the last day of tour, the group descended\nupon a sports bar for their tour dinner. The service\nwas slower than Earthworm Jim\u2019s football and the\nfood colder than Velezzeraptor\u2019s heart but Luis Suarez provided a hand in giving us a penalty shootout for dessert and the touring party returned to\ntheir hostel for the awards of tour to be announced.\nEvan Davies was awarded Player of Tour for his accomplished performances at centre back throughout the 4 games. Man of Tour was awarded to\nEarthworm Jim for his incessant laughter throughout the 7 days, and his dismal performances in all 4\ngames. A new award introduced especially for this\nyear, Lad of Tour, was awarded to Velezzeraptor for\nhis all round ridiculousness.\nFor their last night in Bratislava, IC frequented\nSub Club where the basslines were dirty but the\nhuvely was sparse. Whilst some of the group continued to skank the night away, others returned to\nRio where much was to be gained. With the whole\ngroup congregated at the hostel, Dave managed a\nsolid conversion. Susan Boyle, though, was left\npicking up the pisses of his IBM career. Kernkraft\n400 saw the hostel no longer fit for purpose, and\nsuccessfully sought alternative accommodation for\nthe night with the local constabulary.\nThe following day saw our flight back to Blighty.\nUnfortunately, gnats were not permitted on the\nflight, so The Black Plague was left playing 7 hours\nof extra time as the rest of the group returned home.\nFootballers spread\nculture to Budapest\nand Bratislava...\nThe current crop of airborne rangers, amazingly all still intact\n<< continued from back page\n\n"

The\nmaintenance grant, which is a means-tested sum of money given on top of the\nloan to students, will also be increased\nto a maximum of \u00a33250. The poorest\nstudents will thus have access to \u00a37000/\nyear for living, \u00a31000 more than currently.\nImperial also has plans to increase its\nalready large bursary scheme for students\nwho struggle financially, as it aims to\nattract the best students regardless\nof their ability to pay, something the\nUnion is working with College towards.\nBursaries targeted at the most needy\nare crucial at helping students through\nuniversity and will mean that the headline\nfee (eg. \u00a310,000) will only be paid by the\nwealthiest. Bursaries can be provided\nby universities and by businesses, and\na criticism of the Browne Review is that\nit does nothing to provide incentives\nfor businesses to invest in students\u2019\neducation. 89% of students here who\nresponded to our Browne Review survey\nwanted to see more business bursaries.\nAnother aspect of the Browne Review\nis that government money should be\ntargeted at crucial subjects for which\nthere is a lack of skills in the workplace, or\nsubjects for which education is expensive\nbut salary is not high. STEM subjects and\nMedicine are all mentioned as subjects\nto support financially. This proposal will\nsee Science, Medicine and Engineering\ngraduates leave university with similar\ndebts to arts graduates because of\ngovernment help. We support this\nprinciple.\nIn conclusion, the full policy of the\nUnion on Higher Education funding\nwill be voted on in Union Council on 1\nNovember, this is just our initial response.\nAny student can attend and speak at\nCouncil. The proposals set out, however,\nare encouraging as they help students\nfrom poorer backgrounds more to widen\naccess, maintain the principle that no one\nshould pay up front, give more money\nto students to live on, set a graduate\ncontribution that is linked to earnings and\nfor which the interest rate only applies,\nand you only have to pay the loan back,\nafter you are earning \u00a321,000, up from\nthe current baseline of \u00a315,000. Crucially,\nthey also mean that Universities will get\nthe money they need and can charge the\ncost of the degree, something we need if\nquality of education is to get higher.\nAlex Kendall\nPresident\n\n"

That\u2019s 13.7%\nof the world population.\nAs David Kirkpartick points out in The Facebook Effect, Facebook fills a gap in the online\nworld because it is neither a dating site nor a\nprofessional site like its predecessors. It offers the complete social experience. Facebook\nallows us to literally \u2018lift\u2019 our social networks\ninto the Internet.\nUnlike Friendster or MySpace, we use our real\nidentities on Facebook because our Facebook\nnetwork mirrors that in the real world, a key to\nhow Facebook revolutionized our social lives.\nGone are the times of mustering up courage\nto ask that pretty girl you met at the party for\nher number. \u2018Friend\u2019 her on Facebook instead.\nWe now organize events via Facebook. We stay\nup-to-date with friends on Facebook instead of\ntraditional email. As Sean Parker quoted in the\nnew film on Facebook, The Social Network:\n\u201cWe used to live in villages, then we lived in\ncities, now we live in the Internet\u201d.\nOn founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook\nprofile, he lists \u2018openness\u2019 as one of his inter-est. Openness is a core value of Facebook too,\nKirkpatrick points out in his book. Besides connecting people, openness is also what made Facebook into the technology company valued at\n$33 billion, as reported in The Financial Times\nthis August.\nFacebook: Revolution\nFrom bedroom to billions - Guo Heng Chin talks social\nrevolution in the second installment of our Facebook saga\nWith 500 million users willingly inputting\ntheir personal information on Facebook, it is a\ngold mine for advertisers.\nHowever, Facebook is revolutionary in the\nworld of marketing because you and I list our\ninterests, activities and favourites on our pro-files. It is able to target ads with a demographic\nspecificity not found in other web services. I\ncould easily create an ad on Facebook that targets the estimated 3,620 men in UK between\n18 \u2013 26 years old, attends university, likes Star\nWars, is interested in women and is single.\nStanford Professor, BJ Fogg points out in an\ninterview with Fast Company that Facebook\n\u201ctakes the dynamics of one-to-one persuasion\nand scales it up to millions\u201d.\nThe scale of it has certainly manifested in\nFacebook\u2019s revenue. Business Insider estimated that in 2009, Facebook\u2019s revenue stood at\n$550 million \u2013 $475 million of it comes from\nadvertising.\nWall Street Journal says that Facebook forecasted their earnings to hit between $1.2 and\n$2 billion by 2010. Michael Arrington of Tech\nCrunch says that words are out from mid-level\nFacebook employees that the company\u2019s revenue will top $2 billion this year. Words may\nbe just words, but Facebook has a history of\nexceeding its own expectations.\nFacebook is constantly innovating new ways\nto increase the amount of information shared\nand make easier the process of sharing. News\nfeed turned everyone into a micro-blogger. Facebook Connect lets you use your Facebook profile on other websites; more info on your online\nbehaviour for advertisers. The newly introduced\nPlaces now feeds your current location to Facebook. These new innovations are often wrought\nwith controversy and backlash from users.\nAlready a revolutionary force its short six-year life - where will Facebook be heading\nnext? Certainly the recent defection of top\nGooglers to Facebook and the coming onboard of Internet superstars hint at the immense\npotential of Facebook. Catch up with Facebook\u2019s future in next week\u2019s Felix, as I discuss\nwhether Facebook has already peaked, or will\nsoon become, the Big Brother of the Internetconnected world.\nAccording to Facebook\u2019s statistics page, over\n30 billion \u2018pieces of content\u2019 (blog posts, pho-tos, videos, inane comments, fan pages, statuses etc) are uploaded every month to the web-site. Considering how central Facebook has\nbecome to social interactions these days, that\nfigure isn\u2019t surprising at all. What is surprising\nis that there\u2019s been no way for you to back up\nall of this content \u2013 until now. Facebook has\njust begun rolling out the ability to download\nall your information to your hard drive for\n\u2018back-up purposes\u2019.\nOnce your account has the feature activated,\nyou\u2019ll be able to go to Account -> Account Settings -> Download Information to download a\nzip file containing all the interactions involving your profile since you joined Facebook all\nthose years ago. That\u2019s one massive zip file.\nFacebook\u2019s helpfully included a HTML Facebook page with links to all the information\nthat\u2019s backed up. Unfortunately, there is no way\nof resubmitting the zipped file in order to \u2018reset\u2019 your profile to an earlier state. It\u2019s not that\nkind of backup.\nThe changes come as Facebook moves to\ngive users more freedom in handling the information that Facebook owns on them. Facebook\nstill refuses to make any guarantees on how\nlong they hold any information about you on\ntheir servers though. Privacy issues aside, this\nshould come in very handy if you want to have\nyour own copy of all the photos on your ac-count, rather than trusting Facebook to maintain your profile safely. Get a copy of your\nprofile now and enjoy some offline narcissism\nwhile it\u2019s fresh.\n\n"

The spray has potential for use to create\ngarments, medical dressings or upholstery for furni-ture. It is understood that the closed lab is directly\nrelated to this field of work.\nProf Andrew Livingston, Head of Chemical Engineering Department told Felix that the affair was an\ninternal matter for the department, and declined to\nprovide any specific details.\nA College spokesman later told Felix \u201cThe College\u2019s Safety Director carried out a routine inspection of lab 433 in the Department of Chemical\nEngineering and Chemical Technology. During the\ninspection, the Safety Director found that a fume\ncupboard in the lab needed cleaning, and that the\nregulator on a gas cylinder needed replacing.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 15 October 2010 25\ne Finborough\nfor showcasing new and neglected writers\neck out two new plays\nARTS\nA\npparently, very big\nthings are happening in\nAmerican Literary Fiction (ALF). In August,\nTime Magazine put author Jonathan Franzen on its front cover\nand the whole of the ALF establishment\nwent bonkers. I confess that I haven\u2019t\nread Franzen\u2019s new \u2018masterpiece\u2019, but\nlast year I did force myself through his\nprevious work, The Corrections.\nFranzen is in a difficult spot at the mo-ment. Proclaimed, as he is, as the doyen\nof ALF, he sneered at and refused his\nOprah Winfrey Book Club nomination\nand yet on the front of my copy\nof The Corrections it reads\n\u2018360 billion copies sold\u2019.\nFor someone so widely popular (there\nare probably only about four people\nwho really care that Franzen is on\nthe front of Time) how can he\nmaintain his hubris?\nPerhaps it is all an act and\nhe doesn\u2019t really need those\nthick, black-framed glasses\nand he doesn\u2019t really work in\na dark room with ear plugs in.\nHis image has been as finely\ncrafted as that of Katie Price,\nwhose book I also haven\u2019t read\nyet so can\u2019t fully comment on its\nmerits, so it seems to me that\nthe ALF world is just a\nhighbrow version\nof the Asda Price\nbargain book bin.\nFor a novel centring on a family reunion I found myself totally unaffected\nby The Corrections. The characters (a\nSchopenhauer-quoting, Parkinson\u2019s-suffering Dad, a bitter but hopeful mother,\na pseudo-lesbian daughter... oh I can\u2019t\ngo on \u2013 read it if you must) were parodies of an age that was too knowingly\nconstructed by Franzen to feel in any\nway real.\nWith Franzen\u2019s books, as perhaps with\nthe entire ALF genre, there is a huge\namount of brain, but if his new novel\nFreedom follows in a similar vein, and\nit does again have as its focus American middle class family life, I can\u2019t help\nwondering where its heart is.\nJONATHAN\nFRANZEN\nIS TOTALLY\nOVERRATED\nDavid Carr\nMe and Juliet and Ivan vs. Ivan both run\nthroughout October, tickets between \u00a39\nand \u00a315\nThe tale of Ivan vs. Ivan is a newly adapted play\nby the Canadian based company Talk Is Free\nTheatre. Showing till the end of this month;\nthe cast and crew bring an inspired and witty\npiece of work to life with fun use of props and\nmusical accompaniment. The play is narrated\nthroughout by the fantastic David Dodsley,\nwhose sometimes spontaneous outbursts crafts\nthe play\u2019s comedy and instigates the slapstick\nhumour of Ivan Nikiforovych (Colin Doyle).\nThe play opens with an introduction of the\ntwo Ivan\u2019s; Ivan Ivanovich (Milosh Rodic), a\ntall lanky man possessing great eloquence and\nmischievous character and Ivan Nikiforovych,\nthe complete opposite of the former; a short fat\nman, straight talking and somewhat of a prat in\nnature. The pair are a picture of perfect friend-ship, living as neighbours in their small town\nof Mirgorod. One day Ivan Ivanovich sees that\nIvan Nikiforovych has hanging on his clothes\nline a new gun. Ivan Ivanovich, a proud and\nnoble man, feels that he has everything in the\nworld that he needs and shows off to the audience his property (a miniature prop that at first\nseems amateurish is employed to hilarious ef-fect), becomes mightily jealous. Ivanovich proceeds to attempt to convince Nikiforovych that\nhe should swap this gun for two sacks of oats.\nAbsurd chaos ensues and the friends wreak\nhavoc upon each other, bringing the town into\nmayhem and the pair to court.\nThe cast is engaging and from the outset\nencourage the audience to clap and cheer and\nmakes them feel genuinely a part of the spec-tacle. Rodic brings a pantomimic physicality\nand manic, nearly psychotic mannerisms and\nexpressions which deliver a compelling perfor-mance. It\u2019s this quality in conjunction with the\nrest of the cast\u2019s versatility in changing roles\nthat really roots the show. The ever evolving\nabsurdity parallels with the narrator\u2019s unravelling mismanagement as the story draws to a\nconclusion and particularly drives the slapstick.\nThe direction and acting is so punchy and\nover the top that the play really runs ahead of itself at the beginning and ends up being left be-hind. The momentum is not built up and instead\nfinds that it slows down through the 90 minute\nperformance. The underlying plot and what\nthe audience may imagine as a moral standing\nis clearly never touched upon. The show just\nleaves you with a lack of feeling and thought\nand the departing words of the narrator fall foul\nand without dignity. If Gogol meant for you to\ncapture some sentiment, you certainly don\u2019t\nleave with it.\nJordi Brown\nOver the last couple of years I have had the\npleasure of putting on three little known, but\nwell received, performances of what was codenamed \u2018Panto\u2019. In two weeks time we\u2019ll stage\nthe final Panto Show, laying the series to rest\nonce and for all.\n\u201cOh no you won\u2019t!\u201d\nOh yes, I will. Just one more, with no mis-takes. We want to go out with a bang!\nBut, why \u2018Panto\u2019? It rolls off the tongue\nmore easily than \u2018our-top-secret-show-with-atop-secret-surprise\u2019, and once made us feel like\ncool and edgy artistes; subverting this lighthearted entertainment staple for something so\ncool. And edgy. Anyone who came expecting\nex-soap stars in drag and saucy innuendos were\ndisappointed.\nAll we have, and all we\u2019ve ever had since\nPanto 1, is an idea for a show that could surprise a media-savvy bunch of students who had\nseen it all before, and had the YouTube favourites to prove it.\nSo ambitious! So mysterious! So \u201cembarrassing\u201d was how my trusted friend described our\nrun-through the day before the show. I pretended that it was all part of The Plan\u2122. I ignored\nthe fact that we\u2019d only planned half a show. I\neven ignored the fact that my guys had not paid\nfees to miss a whole day\u2019s lectures (yes, I went\nthere) to prepare a show that was borderline\nretarded.\nI was tactically avoiding publicising the\nevent. The fewer people that saw the show, the\nfewer people who\u2019d have nightmares about me,\nthe crazed, perverted abuser of solidly entertaining evenings.\nAround 50 (lost?) people still turned up;\nenough to successfully lobby for my withdrawal from university, or perhaps, Life itself. This\nwas going to be horrific.\nIt wasn\u2019t. Despite the odd fumbled line and\na completely free-styled ending, the novelty\nof the show went a long way. People laughed.\nPeople gasped (and not in an \u2018i-actually-feelphysically-violated-by-this-crappy-show\u2019\nway). They even stood up and pulled poses on\nrequest. Best of all, the surprises actually sur-prised.\n\u2018Panto\u2019 quickly became a sort-of franchise.\nWe put on a fundraiser sequel and then, a year\nafter the first, we attempted what was to be our\nMagnum Opus; a sequel to Slumdog Millionaire with a Panto-twist.\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\nImperial students make\ntheir last \u2018Panto\u2019\nIvan vs. Ivan: question is, will Ivan win?\nThe director tells us\nabout their very unusual\ninterpretation of a\nseasonal favourite\nSo ambitious! So myste-rious! So \u201cembarrassing\u201d\nObjectively, it was our best Panto yet. It had a\nbig audience. It had a bizarre dairy-based story\narc. It had a guy who interpreted my pre-show\nadvice to \u201chave lots of fun so the audience do\ntoo\u201d as \u201crip open your shirt when you say your\nfirst line of the whole play\u201d. It had it all.\nBut, it wasn\u2019t quite complete. This wasn\u2019t yet\nThe Panto\u2122 that I envisioned all those Pantos\nago. A bit more time and we would have nailed\nit. TV interviews, top-ten lists, the works. Instead we got a heartfelt round of applause,\npeople telling us they loved it and the now-customary feeling of having gotten away with\nit. But it wasn\u2019t complete.\nSo I\u2019m back. We\u2019re back. Slumdog Millionaire 2: Jamal Got Broke is back.\nIt will be one evening in which a small group\nfrom the Islamic Society (whoops, forgot that)\ntry and put on a show with few resources but\nlots of heart and raise money for charity in the\nprocess. And honestly, I think you\u2019ll be presently surprised. You have my name, if not:\nOmar Hafeez-Bore, Director of The Last Panto.\nThursday 28th October 7pm, SAF LT1. \u00a33\n\n"

Plus, he doesn\u2019t seem\ntoo bad a guy, apparently spending holidays at\nhome in Essex and liking The xx.\nReportedly earning an estimated \u00a325m from\nJamie Oliver\u2019s Food Revolution in which he\npersuaded Americans to cut down on junk\nfood; the money will umdoubtedly continue to\npour in with the new stint. And it shows: his\nincreasingly stocky appearance and the swarming \u2018Jamie\u2019s Italian\u2019 chain restaurants opening\naround the country is a tell-tale of his enormous\nwealth.\nBack to the show though, 30-minute meals is\nChannel 4\u2019s third offering of Mr. JO this year,\nwhich, if you like the man, then HURRAH because his 5.30pm slot will be convenient for\nthose making dinner (or for those slumped on\nthe sofa procrastinating from work). Those who\nfeel nauseous from the JO overdose though,\nflick over to E4 where there will be ANOTHER\nFriends episode.\nDana Li\nJamie will be in your face every weekday night for the next 20 days\nThe G-&-Tea Party\nSo as Fresher\u2019s Fortnight draws to a close I\nam sure you will have noticed that gin features\nhighly in many a night out for the Imperial stu-dent. Particularly the Medics. We have all, with\ntime, come to fondly call it Gindamycin: our\nfavourite natural antibiotic. As freshers fortnight ends and freshers flu fortnight begins gin\nmay be your greatest ally. I jest. Drinking is\nbad kids. But if, like me, you came to IC with a\nlimited love of gin at best (mine was promptly\nkilled after a year of Medics related events)\nthen here are a few quick gin cocktail recipes to\nmake it seem a little more palatable\u2026\nGood luck to you all with your sports and society fines to be paid in gin. Hope these help!\nMy favourite! Got its name from the Long Bar\nin Singpore where it was first made:\n1\u00bd shots of gin\n\u00be shot of cherry liqueur or cherry brandy\n\u00bd shot of lemon juice\nClub Soda\nSugar\nCombine gin, lemon juice, and sugar in a shaker with ice. Shake well. Strain into a chilled\nglass with ice. Fill with soda and float the cherry liqueur/brandy on top. Garnish with a twist\nof lemon.\nWell it was good enough for Mr Bond.\n\u00be shot of dry vermouth\n2 \u00bd shots of gin\n2 dashes of orange bitters (optional)\nHalf fill a cocktail shaker with ice and shake\nwith vermouth. Strain to discard excess, leaving ice coated with vermouth.

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX Friday 15 October 2010 35\nThe Hummingbird bakery\nHummingbird Bakery has been supplying\nPortobello Road go-ers with their cakes since\n2004. Originally a British creation, Hummingbird is based on American recipes, and is famed\nfor bringing the Red Velvet cake to the UK. It\nis the Londoner\u2019s go-to-bakery for an instant\nsugar fix, and with one branch situated in South\nKensington, naturally I had to visit the caf\u00e9 to\ndemand an interview from an employee who\u2019d\nlike to be known as Don\u2019t-Mention-the-wordRed-Velvet.\nSo, what is your favourite Hummingbird\ncupcake flavour?\nWell everybody seems to like the Black Bottom\ncupcake, but I think cupcakes are overrated. I\nshudder at the two words \u201cRed Velvet\u201d because\nI spend half my day explaining to customers\nwhat\u2019s in a Red Velvet and Black Bottom! I\ndon\u2019t understand why people are still coming\nup with cupcake companies. Totally not what\nyou want to know, but my favourite is the chocolate chip whoopee pie - it\u2019s really crunchy on\nthe outside and has marshmallow in the middle\nwhich is chocolate flavoured. I don\u2019t think the\nother whoopee pies are like that.\nWhat is a whoopee pie?\nIt looks like a hamburger. The \u2018cake\u2019 bit is basically the same mixture you would make a\ncupcake with, but it is baked on a baking tray,\nso it looks a bit like two Ben\u2019s Cookies with a\nlayer of marshmallow sandwiched in between.\nKind of like a super-sized macaron\u2026 but more\nAmerican style, not posh French style!\nIs it really airy fairy working at Hummingbird?\nIf your team works together, it\u2019s really fun. But\nthe staff gets treated like shit, the girls would be\nmade to do weekend shifts whilst the boys get\noff lightly. We usually work shifts but generally\n9-6pm. It gets really busy between 3-5pm every day, and the queues go out the door! But the\ncustomers are great actually and really polite.\nDo you get free cakes at the end of the day?\nYeah if they\u2019re unwanted! But the longer you\ntake to pack your cakes, the less time you take\nto close the shop so staff generally just take a\nfew. After a few days, you get really put off because you see them throwing away, quite pos-sibly, a hundred cupcakes if it\u2019s a bad day.\nWhat\u2018s your favourite bakery in London?\nBea\u2019s of Bloomsbury. The cupcakes are good\n- the icing isn\u2019t sugar based, more light and\ncreamy, and the cake is feather-light.\nAnd your favourite restaurant?\n(Pierre) Koffman\u2019s. Hands down. But Hix in\nSoho comes a close second.\nDana Li\nWhat started with a mum causing a sugar-fuelled stir at her\ndaughter\u2019s school fair has\nturned into the Kings Road\u2019s\npersonal slice of quirky. These\ncupcakes are sold to you by\npeople with character. They\u2019ll\nsit and chat about anything\nfrom tattoos to camera apertures and fine art degrees as\nthey draw the day\u2019s labels.\nThere is nothing American,\nfalse or pretentious about\nLOVE. If charm is what you\u2019re\nafter, this is the only place\nworth visiting. 319 Kings Road,\nLondon SW3 5EP.\nLove Bakery\nIn the back streets in High\nStreet Kensington is this little\ngem. Donna, the founder, created her first cake recipe \u201cJoy\nCake\u201d at the mere age of 8\nyears old. After sharing her joy\nof baking with friends and family in places such as California,\nNew York, Mexico, Paris and\nnow London, her creations now\nalso grace Westfield Shopping\nCentre and Bluewater Shopping Centre. Around 18 flavours available currently, the\nElvis Presley is a particular hit\nwith the customers. 16 St Alban\u2019s Grove, London. W8 5BP.\nButtercup Cake Shop\nDubbed the \u2018Armani of bread\u2019,\nPrinci is the baby of Rocco\nPrinci and Alan Yau, the latter\nfamed for creating Wagamama,\nYauatcha and the more upmarket Hakkasan. Originating from\nMilan, the bakery is an experience itself with granite islands\nto perch at and a central table\ndecked in bronze. The food\nranges from olive breads and\npassionfruit cheesecake, to\nhot Italian favourites such as\naubergine parmigiana. Reasonably prices with a vibrant atmo-sphere. 135 Wardour Street,\nW1F 0UT\nPrinci\nIn stark contrast to the delicate French pastries that\nflood the bakery scene, Nordic\nBakery prides itself on their\nwholesome rye bread, Finnish\ncinnamon buns and savoury\ndelights such as the \u201cEgg\nand Anchovy\u201d, which I think,\nhas an uncanny resemblance\nto a morula\u2026 You\u2019ll find that\nNorwegians like their coffee served black and strong,\nso forget Starbucks and hop\nalong to this Soho treat.\n14 Golden Square, London W1F\n9JG.\nNordic Bakery\nThe smell of freshly baked\nbread has this amazing opioid\neffect on anyone who walks\npast a bakery, as I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ll know.\nBut if The Hummingbird Bakery does not fulfil your cupcake addiction, there is an\nabundance of other bakeries\nin London which are inspired\nby the likes of Scandinavia,\nItaly and America. Whether it\u2019s\na mere cupcake that you\u2019re\nafter, or a more sophisticated\npastry-filled dinner with friends\nin an Milanese bakery, there\u2019s\nno end to what you can find in\nLondon.\nHere are a handful of our\nfavourites that we would definitely recommend you to visit\nyou\u2019re hungry and cruising\naround our glorious London\ntown:\nLondon bakeries\nalso worth visiting...\nDana Li & Nadia Paes\nPhoto by Marie Chkaiban\n\n"
