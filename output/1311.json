The students\nand staff at Imperial College\nhave come out in full force\nto support this venture. The\nmedics have had a bar night\nat the Reynolds, and all clubs\nand societies have taken it\nupon themselves to collect as\nmuch money as they can, at\nthe same time raising their\nown profile.\nIslamic Society has apparently raised about \u00a3700 in a\nsingle meeting, and the Sri\nLanka and Tamil societies\nhave been involved in cross-campus collections along\nwith the Thai and Malaysian\nsocieties.\nAt the moment, more than\na 120 tins are in circulation in\nand around College, in halls of\nresidence and bars. To date,\nwe have collected \u00a32591.49.\nSo if you see a tin, empty\nyour pockets, please! This is\na catastrophe that needs a\nsustained effort and is more\nthan just the flavour of the\nseason.\nTo all those directly involved\nin the collection, you are doing\na worthy service and should\ncontinue your efforts.\nIf anyone else wants to\nget involved, contact RAG\n(rag@ic.ac.uk) or walk into\nthe City & Guilds office, room\n340 in mechanical engineer-ing, and take a collecting tin.\nFor those who have tins, it\nmight be a good idea to return\nthem any time this week.\nWe need volunteers to get\ninvolved and to continue\nraising money. More opportunities will arise in RAG\nWeek, scheduled from 7 to 11\nFebruary. Get involved!\nStudents raise thousands\nfor tsunami appeal\nMake the College\ncontribute\nBy Colin Smith\nImperial College Union\nWelfare Campaigns Officer\nThe generosity from ordinary people all over Britain\nin response to the disastrous\neffects of the Asian tsunami\nhas been remarkable, with\nmany millions of pounds having already been donated. In\nstark contrast, the current\ngovernment figure still only\nstands at the equivalent of\nfive and a half days\u2019 spending\non occupying Iraq.\nThere is a similar contrast\nwithin Imperial College. The\nresponse from students has\nbeen fantastic, with the total\nraised currently standing at\naround \u00a32500 and set to rise\nfurther. In response to this,\na motion will be presented to\nUnion Council on Tuesday 18\nJanuary, resolving to do two\nthings.\nFirstly, the paper will\ndemand that the College,\nwith all its money and sponsorship deals with oil and\npharmaceutical companies,\ndonates ten times the final\namount raised by students.\nAs it stands, that would be an\nextra \u00a325,000.\nSecondly, it will demand\nthat our Rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, gives the same proportion of his income to the\nappeal as the students have.\nThe average donation from\nstudents seems to be around\n\u00a32. Given that the non-means-tested loan for home\nstudents in London is \u00a33,790\nper year, and given that the 27\nFebruary 2004 issue of Felix\nreported Sir Richard accepting a pay rise to take his\nannual salary to \u00a3251,000, he\nwould have to give approximately \u00a3126.\nAnyone wishing to lend\ntheir support to the motion\nby seconding it should email\nme at cs602@ic.ac.uk.\nOne of dozens of collecting tins doing the rounds at Imperial, raising money for the appeal\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nFabric is one of those places you really can\u2019t have missed. Whether you\u2019re\na clubber or not, you\u2019ll no doubt have\nseen or been handed their stylishly\ndesigned monthly flyers in record\nshops, on leaving clubs, gigs or bars,\nand even around College.\nWith three rooms, each easily big\nenough to be a venue in its own\nright, and a capacity of 3000, the\nplace attracts an astounding array\nof well known and very good DJs.\nIt consistently offers a quality night\nout.\nFor many people, Fabric is where\nthey popped their clubber\u2019s cherry.\nFor some, it\u2019s epitomises the clubbing experience. I know people who\nrarely, if ever, go elsewhere. It\u2019s also\na bit of a tourist attraction, and why\nnot? I would advise anyone to go,\neven out of idle curiosity.\nThere really is a lot to love about\nthe place, but personally it\u2019s the\nvariety that keeps me coming back.\nOn any given night you\u2019ll find distinct and sometimes very different\nmusic in each of the rooms, and even\nmore of a mixture in the crowd itself.\nThere are first-timers alongside regulars and ageing old-school ravers,\nLondoners and people visiting from\nthe provinces as well as tourists\nfrom further afield.\nNormally I\u2019d go for house nights,\nbut tonight I\u2019d come to check out\nsome hip hop. Of course, since it\u2019s\nFabric, there was also drum and\nbass in room 2 and electro in room\n3. The line ups were, as ever, mouth-watering, including Craze (two sets\n\u2013 one hip hop, one drum and bass)\nScratch Perverts, The Herbaliser,\nKlashnekoff, Tigerstyles, Dillinja &\nLemon D, and Bones and Ramsey.\nArriving pretty early, our first port\nof call was room 2, where the drums\nand bass were already in full effect.\nNow, I do like drum and bass, but\nwhen confronted with a heaving\nmass of bodies as we found, I tend to\nwimp out and head for somewhere\nwith a bit more space. At least until\nI\u2019ve found my dancing feet, anyway.\nSo we continued through to room\n1 where we found The Herbaliser\nbehind the decks.\nThese guys are the pride of Ninja\nTune, representing UK hip hop.\nGiven this, the scene before us was\nsomething of a disappointment. The\nroom was pretty empty, and whilst\nthis was partly due to the early hour,\nthe music wasn\u2019t really helping. I\nadmit I\u2019m not a hip hop afficionado,\nand I\u2019m used to being impressed at\nFabric. Maybe I\u2019m spoiled, but this\njust didn\u2019t seem to be cutting the\nmustard. In a city where there is a\nlot of \u2018bling\u2019 around, any DJ playing\nR\u2018n\u2019B, soul or hip hop needs to stand\nout, or at least make the grade. I\nlove their music, but these guys just\nsounded generic and bland.\nAnd so onwards and upwards to\nroom 3. This is the smallest of the\nthree, but it has its own sense of\nintimacy as the DJ booth is at the\nsame level as the dancefloor, so\nyou can check out the jock\u2019s skills\nwhilst enjoying the sounds. Hoxton\u2019s\nBones and Ramsey were pumping\nout some electro beats, and this was\nreally doing the trick. After a while\nspent vegged out on a sofa, indulging in some people-watching, my\nfeet were itching. A few vodka shots\nlater, and we were all quite happily\nwiggling around the room, which\nwas nicely full \u2013 enough people for\nan atmosphere, but not so many that\nyou had to watch where your arms\nwere swinging.\nAfter an hour or so, we headed\nback to room 2, and this time I was\na lot more impressed. Now the stage\nwas filled with many decks and mix-ers, with a similar amount of DJs\nand MCs. We saw Desi collective\nTigerstyles, and another crew that\nI can\u2019t name, but, to coin a phrase,\nthis shit was heavy. There were\nfusing hip hop beats, double-speed\ndrum and bass breaks and all manner of bass and scratch sounds, with\na good smattering of to-the-point\nrhymes. Now the room was full, and\nbumping \u2013 just the way it should be.\nAside from Herbaliser\u2019s uninspiring performance, there were only\na couple of things wrong with this\nnight. Sadly, Klashnekoff was a\nno-show, but in his place the MCs\norganised an impromtu beatbox\ncompetition, pulling two contestants\nfrom the audience. This was actually quite enjoyable \u2013 these guys had\nsome serious oral dexterity. As the\nMC put it: \u201cIf he can beatbox like\nthat, what\u2019s he gonna be like with\nthe ladies...?\u201d\nThe only other let-down was\nmyself \u2013 Fridays can be a bit hectic\nif you\u2019re tired from a hard week. I\nwas, and had to quit and go home at\n2am, missing headliners the Scratch\nPerverts. I think I may finally be getting old.

Two weeks of fris-bee-lessturkeyandChristmas\npudding eating had slowed\nImperial\u2019s Disc Doctors down\nto a crawl.\nDisc Doctors 13\nCurve 7\nUnsurprisingly, the first game\nagainst Curve was a little on\nthe slow side. Everything was\nin Imperial\u2019s favour. There\nwas no wind, and the Curve\nguys had even chosen to play\ninto the sun! Still, the Disc\nDoctors (DD) went 2\u20130 down,\ndue to a couple of overhead\nhucks.\nNo sooner had the Disc\nDoctors put an end to the\noverheads, the score began\nto turn in their favour. A quick\ncomeback left the final score\nat 13\u20137.\nDr PAF 9\nDisc Doctors 5\nDue to a last minute pull-out\nin Division 3, a new pickup\nteam, \u2018Dr PAF\u2019, was formed\nfrom PAF players, a few very\neager Americans, and our\nvery own Nathan and MadK.\nDr PAF fought harder than\nshoppers at the January\nsales, sending a couple of\nquick upfield passes. They\nhad great organisation on\npitch, especially for a team\nwho don\u2019t usually play togeth-er. MadK scored a couple\nagainst DD, almost losing\nhis \u2018Committee Status\u2019 in the\nprocess (only kidding!)\nDD had the opportuni-ties, but, quite frustratingly,\ndropped a number of endzone passes. There was one\nvery long point that seemed\nto drag on for an eternity,\nwearing everyone down. Not\neven some fantastic hucks\nfrom Jay and Stylish could\nsave DD.\nIt finished 9\u20135 to the PAF\nfolks, but the free massages\nfromtheDrPAFplayersmade\nDD\u2019s efforts worthwhile!\nDiscuits 2 10\nDisc Doctors 9\nThis game was likely to be\nthe toughest. Discuits 2 were\nformidable opponents, jam-packed full of experience and,\ndare I say it, tall players!\nThey came straight at DD\nwith a zone, catching the\nguys unaware. They blocked\na hammer to score the first\npoint, then two consecutive\npoints after that. A brilliant\nflow of passes from Magic\nto Kev to Stylish to Stas got\nDD back in the game. With\nDoctors\u2019 discs flowing like\nraging rivers, Discuits resorted back to man marking to put\na plug in DD\u2019s scoring spree.\nWhen Discuits were 8\u20135 up,\nthey began to throw away a\nnumber of discs, but as the\nhorn went at 10\u20138 to Discuits,\nit was clear they had won.\nIn the true style of Ultimate,\nthe final point was played out\nwith just as much intensity,\neven though the outcome of\nthe game had already been\ndecided. DD won the point\nand the game finished 10\u20139.\nThe day ended with a singsong from Discuits, a game of\nKabaddi and a trip to the pub.\nAt this point, Nathan reminded me that he actually won all\nof his games, since he played\nfor Dr PAF for the last two.\nCheeky hucker!\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nDisc Doctors back in action\nCity & Guilds Men 1st 26\nHAC Men\u2019s 1st 5\nBy Andrew Towers\nCast in the phallus-like\nshadow of the city\u2019s erotic\ngherkin, the mighty City and\nGuilds rugby team played\ntheir final match of the\nautumn term. The opposi-tion: the Honourable Artillery\nCompany.\nSeverely depleted through\ninjury, apathy and alcohol,\nthe C&G squad consisted of\n14 men, two of whom had\nbeen called out of retirement\nto boost numbers. However,\nupon arrival at arguably the\nworld\u2019s most valuable rugby\npitch, it became apparent that the HAC were also\nstruggling, with only 13 men\nto avenge their 66-29 defeat\nat the hands of a rampant\nC&G team last year. Rugby\nleague style, the flankers\nwere dropped to accommodate these numbers. Their\nlack of front row also meant\nunopposed scrums.\nThe result of this was an\nunusually open game, with\nthe HAC exposing gaps\naround the fringes, and the\nC&G backs exposing the\nspace out wide. With the\nageing Adrian \u201cpretty fat\nfor a fast man\u201d Lewis stepping in at 10, Mike \u201cI love\nImperial too much to bother\ngraduating\u201d Hicks deputis-ing for our entire back row,\nand Will \u201cI had to cycle from\nCroydon to get here\u201d Green\nkindly substituting for us,\nan otherwise young and\nsprightly C&G dominated\nmuch of the first half with\nsome flowing moves and\ndirect running, coming\nclose to opening the scoring\non a number of occasions.\nAlthough both teams managed to cross the opponents\u2019\nline, the first half ended a\ndisappointing 0-0.\nThe good humour and fair\nplay disappeared quickly, as\nthe second half turned into\na scrappy, somewhat ill-tem-pered affair. Late tackles,\nsliding tackles, stamping and\neven trash-talk crept into the\ngame. The referee only exacerbated things by allowing\nmuch of the dangerous play\nto continue throughout the\nhalf.\nHowever, the superior fitness and skill of C&G started to make the difference,\nresulting in a dubious try\nfor the prolific Matt Taylor\nafter some Zidane-like footballing skills from the backs.\nThe powerful Mike Hicks\nwaltzed through the goal-line defence to add to the\nC&G lead, before fresher and\nladies\u2019 favourite Luke Taylor\nsnatched his first try for the\nclub.\nThe C&G scoring was\nwrapped up by an incisive\nfinish from the tenacious\nMatt Bangor after some hard\nwork from Nathan Alliston.\nThe HAC managed a try during this spell of scoring, but\nnever threatened to take\ncontrol of the game. With\nLewis contributing a respectable three out of four conver-sions, the game ended 26-5\nin favour of the Guildsmen.\nOther notable performances\ninclude that of debutant Neil\nTurkington, whose \u201caggressive\u201d tackling kept much\nof the HAC back line very\nquiet for the duration of the\nmatch.\nThis provided a satisfying end to an enjoyable\nyear which leaves the most\nglamorous team in Imperial\nunbeaten, and reigning\nSevens Champions (many\nthanks to the Numanator,\nand particularly to Alex\n\u201che\u2019s behind you\u201d O\u2019Rourke,\nfor all their help and hard\nwork). Plans for 2005 include\nmini-tours to Oxford,\nCambridge and hopefully\nDublin!\nRUGBY\nGlamour and the City\nJabberwock\n\n"

The fact that it takes\nsix weeks to get pay for some shifts\nis of course ridiculous, but I think the\nmost important part of your article\nto highlight was what Mustafa Arif\nhad to say about non-student casual\nstaff still being paid weekly!\nWhen the change happened, we\nwere told that it was necessary for\nus to have our pay scheme changed\nin order to bring us in line with the\nrest of college\u2019s staff, as this would\nreduce costs in payroll. The fact that\nthere are still staff being paid weekly\nby college payroll enforces my belief\nthat it was not necessary to fast-track all of us student staff onto the\nscheme. There could have been far\nmore time for negotiation with the\nUnion and planning by the college\nto make sure that if it did eventually\nbecome truly necessary for us to be\non monthly pay, it could have gone\nahead without all the glitches we\nhave experienced. These included\nnot being paid, being paid too much,\ntax and NI not being deducted, emergency tax being deducted and so on\nad infinitum...\nPerhaps, too, if we had been\nwarned of this change, those of us\nwho are hard up enough to need our\ncash \u201cup front\u201d would have had a\nchance to make alternative arrangements before the start of term. It\nwould have been even nicer if we\nhad been consulted on the change,\nbut then again, as it seems that\nMustafa himself was barely consult-ed, that might be like asking for the\nmoon on a stick.\nYours,\nJess Baker\nIV Chemistry with Management\nSecurity and medics\nDear Felix,\nToday, Tuesday 18 January, a student\nhad a fit in the entrance hall of the\nSir Alexander Fleming Building.\nStudents present at the time\nwere reported to have done nothing\nexcept continue to purchase their\nfood from the shop while watching on. Eventually a student had\nthe sense to ring Sherfield Security\n(of which there should be a fully\ntrained medical officer at all times),\nafter which four (allegedly) burly\nbut medically incompetent guards\nappeared with no first aid equipment and proceeded to join in the\nstaring contest.\nParamedics were eventually called\nand arrived within minutes and dealt\nwith the situation accordingly. One\nof the students who originally aided\nthe suffering student was rewarded\nby a \u2018Well done miss,\u2019 by one of the\nsecurity officers.\nLessons to be learnt from this:\nSherfield Security need to review\ntheir procedures for first aid train-ing; medical students really don\u2019t\nknow what they\u2019re doing even when\nthreatened with a real life situation.\nKind regards,\nName and department supplied\nMore exam anguish\nDear Felix,\nI\u2019d like to write a short response to\nMr Rorke\u2019s letter in issue 1311.\nCan I just point out that I personally pointed out to Mr Rorke the\nissues several weeks before the end\nof the autumn term and heard nothing back from him on the subject\nand it was up to the students themselves within their departments to\nkick up a fuss to get their exam\ndates changed! Surely since dates\nare confirmed two years in advance\nas (Sam so courteously pointed out\nto the readership), the DPEWs of the\nlast three years had plenty of time to\nrealise the problem far earlier?\nYet another example of the union\u2019s\nbumbling inability to see into the\nfuture and take preventative action,\nleaving them shrugging their shoulders and scratching themselves; letting the students down inevitably.\nYours Sincerely,\nTim Weinert-Aplin\nAero 4\nDear Felix,\nTwo weeks ago I had a letter published here. Despite it being anonymous I have since received some\nreprecussions. I would like to re-iter-ate the points in the article 2 weeks\nago.\n1) In response to a Felix headline\nlast term I pointed out that Mech\nEng was not the only department\nwith a ridiculous Christmas period,\nwe in ESE also had problems \u2013 fault\nfor this in my opinion clearly lies\nwith college who set the term dates\n\u2013 why we could not have started that\nterm earlier I do not know.\n2) Also in response to a Felix headline last term, examinable material\n(indeed an exam) was scheduled\nin the lunch period \u2013 clashing with\nsome peoples humanities courses\n(hence why nothing should be timetabled in the lunch hour). The only\noption I was given was to sit it in\nthe afternoon, which clashed with\na departmental lecture. I eventually sat it then. I believe no student\nshould be put in this position \u2013 I do\nnot accept that Monday 3rd being a\nBank Holiday as an excuse, it has\nbeen scheduled then for a long time.\nIf exams were indeed supposed to\nhave being scheduled for the \u2018first\nMonday\u2019 of term (10th) then there\nwould not be a full day of departmental lectures that day. I believe blame\nfor this lies with the department,\nas other departments don\u2019t seem to\nhave had this problem.\nThe point I was trying to make\nwas that individually these problems\nwould not have been that bad but\ncombined between them they could\ncause students great distress in\nwhat is an important year of there\ndegree.\nI would also like to point out and\napologise to the secretarial staff of\nthe department, who may have misunderstood the article, I believe they\nare not at fault for the above prob-lems, the job they perform, which\nincludes being a link between students and the department is performed consistently in a faultless\nmanner with a cheerful attitude, and\nall the more admirable bearing in\nmind the \u201cfluid and laissez faire\u201d\nnature of the department (as discussed above and in my previous\nletter).\nThankyou\nJohn Sykes\nMSci Geology (3rd year)\n(The Still Disgruntled Rock Hunter)\nBabar Ahmad\nDear Felix,\nWe, the family of Babar Ahmad,\nreject outright and condemn the\ndecision of the Independent Police\nComplaint\u2019s Commission (IPCC) to\nformally discipline one of the several Anti-Terrorist Branch Police\nOfficers who caused life-threaten-ing injuries to Babar whilst in their\ncustody on 02 December 2003. We\nfurther question the timing of this\ndecision, more than a year after the\nassault, and a week prior to BBC2\u2019s\ndocumentary on Babar\u2019s case on\n26th January 2005. We feel that this\nis a cynical ploy to create a scapegoat out of one officer to spare the\nsuperiors from blame.\nOur faith in the British Justice\nSystem is such that we always\nexpected a \u201ccover-up\u201d from the\noutset, but we did not expect the\nIPCC, Crown Prosecution Service\nand members of the medical profession to be part of it. This is the\nfourth time that the authorities have\ncharged their version of events of\nwhat happened to Babar on that\nday. First they declared in court that\nBabar\u2019s injuries were old injuries.\nThen they said that \u201csome\u201d of the\ninjuries were old. Then they said that\nBabar kicked, punched and violently\nresisted arrest. Now they are saying\nthat the injuries were not old and\nsome of the officers used excessive\nforce. They have also claimed that\nthe officers acted as such because\nthey believed Babar to be a highly\ndangerous terrorist who trained in\nAl-Qaida camps.\nThis latest decision leaves a\nnumber of questions unanswered:\n1) If Babar violently resisted arrest\nand attacked police officers, why\nwas he not charged with assaulting\npolice?\n2) Where is the medical evidence\nof any injuries sustained by the\npolice officers?\n3) If only one police officer assaulted Babar, why did the others stand\nthere and watch?\n4) Why did 3 independent eyewitnesses (neighbours) inform the\ninvestigation that they did not witness any struggle?\n5) WhyhasBabar not been charged\nwith making false allegations against\nmembers of the police?\n6) If Babar was a highly dangerous Al-Qaida terrorist, why was\nhe released without charge in\nDecember 2003?\n7) Why did the IPCC ignore the\nopinion of Dr Manolis Gavalas, an\nindependent medico-legal expert\nwho examined Babar?\nWe would like all of the officers\nconcerned to be charged and pros-ecuted, not just disciplined with a\nslap on the wrist. We are considering taking further action and we\nseek an urgent independent public\ninquiry into this matter.\nFamily of Babar Ahmad\n\u25cf Terror Suspect\u2019s Dad, a documentary on the \u2018Free Babar Ahmad\u2019\ncampaign, will be shown at 10pm on\nWednesday 26 January on BBC2.\nFun in Felix?\nIt saddens me to write this. In years\ngone by, the pages of noble Felix\nwere filled with interesting columns\nand funny stories. So much so in fact\nthat my vastly inferior writing skills\nwere never called upon. Now, howev-er, things have changed. Very much\nfor the worse. First we lose the format for cost reasons \u2013 fair enough.\nBut did you have to cull all the writers as well? I mean you didn\u2019t even\npay them. They had vision, skills and\npossibly even ideas.\nThe idea of a student paper is not\nto deliver daily news from the business world, or even daily national\nnews. That\u2019s what actual newspapers are for. A student paper should\noffer information about student life\n\u2013 funny events, places to eat, general\ncrude. It should be interesting. Fair\nenough we\u2019re all geeky enough to\nappreciate computers and gadgets.\nBut maybe more reviews of games\nand funky stuff and less dry pieces\nabout operating systems \u2013 which\nas anyone knows, aren\u2019t interesting,\neven to mac fanatics.\nYou need to have information on\nhow the university is being run and\nplans for the future. You also need\nto have columns on how wonderful\ndonuts are and how ignoring deadlines seriously reduces dancing ability at dB\u2019s. However, these shouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily be vying for space in the\nsame column.\nSo what needs to be done?\nBasically there needs to be a drive\nback towards fun \u2013 everyone needs\na break from knowledge occasionally\nsurely? Is there really no place for\nfannying about? What are we, serious scientists or students? There is\nso much more to life than studying.\nI mean really there is. No matter\nhow much you pay to study, you\u2019re\nmissing out on the whole aim of university if you use it just to work. Like\nmeeting people, having fun, maybe\neven putting something back into the\nuni and/or the community. But obviously it is not obligatory \u2013 I would\nnot be where I am today if it weren\u2019t\nfor my highly developed sense of\napathy and a keen knowledge of how\nbest to avoid doing stuff. Still I know\nthat occasionally a little effort makes\neverything better. In this instance,\nit is mainly that if by some quirk of\nfate I manage to encourage people to write something, I will have\nsomething to read and I won\u2019t have\nto spend weeks deciding whether\nor not to write something instead\nof staring blankly into the Mission\nFailed screen of GTA 3.\nTristan Lane\nMedic, 5th year\nDave Edwards, Editor, replies:\nFelix is a popular newspaper this\nyear. Almost all of our 4000 copies disappear quickly each week. I\nhave received more compliments\non the new style of Felix than I could\npossibly count.\nCost was only one factor behind\nthe change of format. The new \u2018compact newspaper\u2019 style defines Felix\nas a student newspaper, rather than\nlying somewhere between newspaper and magazine. The new style\nlooks more like a \u2018real\u2019 publication\nand is taken more seriously and\ngiven more respect as a result.\nWe didn\u2019t cull any writers \u2013 they\neither left College or just stopped\nwriting, unfortunately. To imply\nthat our current team of contributors lacks vision, skill and ideas is\na cheap and ultimately pointless\ninsult to these hard-working, talented volunteers.\nMany Imperial students are interested in national and/or business\nnews, and we are able to give a\nlimited amount from our own per-spective, so why shouldn\u2019t we do\nthat? The operating system articles\nhave attracted several comments\nand questions from readers \u2013 it\u2019s\nclear that people are interested in\nthat kind of thing.\nOf course there is space for \u2018fun\u2019\narticles, but we need people to write\nthem. Incidentally, Coffee Break\nalready offers two pages of fun\nand games each week. I\u2019m not sure\nthat we should be offering \u2018general\ncrude\u2019, whatever that is.\nAny student is welcome to write\nfor Felix. We really do want as many\npeople as possible to get involved\n\u2013 it\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, and we\ninclude something like 80-90% of\nwhat we receive. I accept that there\nis less fun, comedy, humorous columns etc in Felix this year, but that\u2019s\nonly because no-one seems to want\nto write them! If there\u2019s something\nyou want to see in these pages, you\ncan do something about it \u2013 either\nmake a specific suggestion or write\nit yourself. Contact me at felix@ic.\nac.uk.\n\u25cf I am pleased to say that Tristan\nLane writes for Felix in this week\u2019s\nSport section, page 23, and in next\nweek\u2019s Comment section\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk. Make your voice heard\nLetters may be edited for length, but not for spelling or grammar.\nLetters are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion.\n\n"

The\nEditor\u2019s deadline to get copy to the\nprinters was 12 noon on Wednesday.\nIt is now 12.43pm and he is glaring\nat me. I didn\u2019t go to bed last night\n(for the second time this week, so\nfar) because I was caught up with\nwork in the office. If, for some rea-son, you are able to combine the\nqualities Sam talks about below\nwith the sheer commitment and\ndrive required to do this on a regular basis, then I suggest you stand\nfor election as Union President.\nNominations do open next week\nafter all. You might want to re-read\nmy (allegedly scary) column from\nthis time last year to get a glimpse\nof what you are in for...\nHMV Discounts\nHere is my response to a letter in\nthe 9 December issue of Felix. You\u2019ll\nbe pleased to know that all Imperial\nstudents are indeed able to get discounts at HMV, without an NUS\ncard. In fact, HMV give us their own\ndiscount cards every year to hand\nout at Freshers Fair. If you are having any problems, it\u2019s because the\nbranch manager is simply a moron.\nIf you email the Union\u2019s marketing manager, Penelope Parker\n(p.parker@ic.ac.uk) you\u2019ll find that\na quick email from her to HMV\nhead office will solve the problem.\nPlease remember to give Penelope\nthe details of the offending HMV\nbranch.\nStudent staff pay problems\nI believe Felix is covering this issue\nin detail on the front page. I think\nthe College recognise the problem\nand it will get sorted out. My only\ncomment is that it\u2019s disappointing\nthat the Union was not consulted\nbeforehand. Had we, as the representative body of students, been\nasked for our opinions, this could\nhave been prevented. Instead, the\nCollege has created six months of\nhardship and headaches for students and managers alike.\nRadical change\nOne of the hardest things to do\nin any leadership position is to\nengage in a meaningful change pro-gramme. Imperial College Union\nshould be, first and foremost, the\nrepresentative body of students at\nImperial. The initial results of the\nstrategic review survey are very\nclear \u2013 we are failing to engage the\nvast majority of the membership.\nThis is untenable and things must\ntherefore change.\nInevitably there will be conflict\n\u2013 and the machinations of student\npoliticians will spill over into the\npages of Felix. The thing to remem-ber, however, is that conflict demonstrates a willingness to challenge\ndeeply entrenched interests. Just\nso long as everyone\u2019s aims are\nthe same and it doesn\u2019t all get too\npetty...\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nThe joy of... making a difference\nEver wanted to make a difference?\nIt is a common human trait that\nwe like to think we have made the\nworld a better place, having given a\nworthwhile contribution to society.\nSome might look for a labour-sav-ing invention, while others seek the\ncure to a debilitating disease. Many\nhave wished to spread peace and\nhappiness, while others still have\nhoped to inspire the world by their\nartistic contributions. It is a common driving force that most people\nwant to leave their mark on the\nworld.\nWhilst few of us will probably have\nthe opportunity to make such world-changing influences as this, there\nare ways in which people can make\na difference to their local communi-ties. In our community of Imperial\nCollege, one of the networks that\nholds many people together is\nImperial College Union. The Union\nis the recognised voice of Imperial\nstudents, and constantly strives to\nimprove the lot of our students and\nlook after their educational, sport-ing, social, and welfare needs. In\nshort, the Union is more than just\na bar!\nHow about doing something that\nwill really help you stand out from\nthe crowd, learning practical skills\nin a supportive, fun environment and\nhelping your fellow students along\nthe way? Have you thought about\nbecoming a sabbatical officer?\nElections to the five sabbatical\nposts of the Imperial College Union\nwill be taking place in February and\nthis may just be the year for you to\nmake your mark. While it is undeniably hard work, serving as a sabbatical offers a unique opportunity to\ndevelop skills and experiences that\nwill stand you in good stead whatever you choose to do in life.\nAs Deputy President (Finance &\nServices) you would be responsible for the day-to-day running of\nthe Union\u2019s finances and would get\nto manage an annual turnover of\naround \u00a36 million. You also have a\nsay in the strategic planning of the\nUnion and are responsible for ensuring that the services and facilities\nthat the Union provides meet the\nstudents\u2019 needs. If you don\u2019t have\nany previous financial knowledge,\ndon\u2019t worry \u2013 the Union\u2019s experienced permanent staff are there to\nhelp you out and teach you all you\nneed to know.\nThe Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) is responsible for the management of the Union\u2019s many clubs\nand societies, monitoring feedback\nfrom clubs and working on strategies to improve the service offered.\nYou will take responsibility for training and student development as well\nas health and safety.\nAs Deputy President (Education\n& Welfare), you would be responsible for the Union\u2019s network of academic and welfare representatives,\nthe Union\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears on the\nground\u201d. Using these representa-tives, you would be involved in promoting important welfare issues and\ncampaigns, as well as safe-guarding\nthe education of Imperial College\nstudents.\nAs Felix Editor, in addition to editing the newspaper you will also be\nresponsible for its financial manage-ment, which involves raising around\n\u00a330,000 in advertising revenues over\nthe course of the year. The day-to-day editing involves everything\nfrom trying to turn rather difficult\nsubmissions into printable content\n\u2013 this can be anything right the way\ndown to sports reports written on\nthe back of a fag packet \u2013 to image\nmanipulation and graphic design.\nIf you want a varied role that\npresents a real challenge, you might\nconsider standing for President. As\nthe figurehead, you would not only\nhave ultimate responsibility for all\nof the Union\u2019s activities but would\nalso be the public face of the student\nbody. As a College Governor, you are\nthe only student who can be sued\nor prosecuted (the Union is a \u00a36\nmillion organisation, for which you\nhave unlimited personal liability).\nYou have to balance this against the\nbreadth of the role, the celebrity status and the support from hundreds\nof staff and volunteers.\nFormer sabbaticals say they\u2019ve\nused their experiences at the Union\nin all manner of ways. From helping them start out on their chosen\ncareer path to learning essential life\nskills, it seems that nobody forgets\ntheir sabbatical year.\nNominations open on Tuesday, 18\nJanuary at midday and close on\nTuesday 1 February at midday. For\nfurther information, or to nominate\nyourself, please visit www.union.\nic.ac.uk/elections. Voting will be\nheld online in mid-February \u2013 more\ndetails on this will follow.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of standing and\nwould like to find out what being\na sabbatical is really like, or need\nany more information on each of\nthe posts, the current sabbaticals will be happy to speak to you.\nPlease contact Rebecca Coxhead\n(r.coxhead@ic.ac.uk, 020 759 48060)\nto arrange an appointment.\nOn a personal note, I think standing for a sabbatical position was one\nof the best decisions I\u2019ve taken, and\nI\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my time so\nfar. So if you\u2019d like to make a difference to the lives of students, while\ngaining valuable life skills, why not\nstand for election?\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nTime to tighten the purse strings?\nWell, I hope you all had a great holiday and enjoyed yourself. After all\nthe partying and over-indulgence of\nChristmas, it is easy to forget about\nthe bills that are coming your way\nafter the festive period. Credit card\nbills, accommodation fees, fuel bills\nand tuition fees can all build up long\nafter Santa has left your chimney.\nIt is often easy to bury your head\nin the sand and worry about these\nissues when they come up after the\nholiday, probably about now, but\nwhat happens when you get these\nbills and you actually cannot pay\nthem, no matter how much you try\nto find the money?\nOne option in this situation is to\nask your bank to extend your over-draft, but what happens if the smiling bank manager says no?\nWhen you find yourself in this situ-ation, it is easy to forget that there\nare people around who can help you.\nOne area of the College that can help\nis the Student Finance Office. They\ndeal with the Access To Learning\nFund, which gives students amounts\nof money up to \u00a3500. To find out if\nyou are eligible for this fund, please\ncontact the student support officer\nat p.worley@ic.ac.uk.\nIf it gets to the point where you\nare receiving letters from companies and they are demanding money,\nthen come to the Information and\nAdvice Centre. We can act on your\nbehalf to try to negotiate payment\nplans for the bills. We do this by writing a letter from the centre to the\ndifferent companies that you owe\nmoney to.\nWe can also work out what you can\nactually afford to pay and negotiate\nwith this figure to the companies.\nBasically, if you can\u2019t pay, it is better\nto let people know than to hope that\nit will all go away. The Information\nand Advice Centre can assist you\nwith this situation and help you to\ncome through the other side.\nThe Centre can also help you if you\ncannot pay the College. Whether this\nbe tuition fees or accommodation\nfees, we can advocate for you and try\nto get the relevant people to either\ngive you more time to pay or negotiate a payment plan.\nI hope that this article has given\nyou some idea of the support available to you if you find yourself in\nfinancial hardship. Remember: don\u2019t\nlet your concern turn into a crisis.\nMake The Information and Advice\nCentre your one stop shop for all\nwelfare issues.\n\u25cf The Information and Advice\nCentre is now in the East Wing basement of Beit Quad.

Human rights violation\nBy William Gates\nBioengineering department\nFollowing the birth of its\n1.3 billionth inhabitant on\nThursday, China\u2019s birth control measures are as necessary as ever. Their policy of\n\u2018one child per family\u2019 has\nalready produced a reduction in birth rates, causing\nthe population of the country\nto be an estimated 300 million\npeople short of what it would\nhave been had there been no\nrestriction. A population peak\nof 1.46 billion is still expected\nby 2035.\nHe stared nonchalantly at\nhis firstborn, a girl. Great,\nhe thought. Tick that box on\nmy license. Then hello life\nof celibacy, life of chastity,\nlife of the incapacitating\nvasectomy. He shuddered at\nthe thought. It would be any\nminute now that the men in\nthe white coats would burst\nviolently into the room,\ndemanding his submission.\nBecause they, after all, will\nbe the ones holding the scal-pel. Accidents do happen,\nthey will say. Play along and\nwe might just be extra careful with you.\nDid he just glimpse a shad-ow?\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey,\u201d his\nwife ventured compassion-ately. \u201cYou could always\nwear a condom.\u201d\nA what?\n\u201cOne of those relics?\u201d he\nsnorted back. \u201cThey haven\u2019t\nbeen in use since the beginning of the century. Get with\nthe times, woman!\u201d Rage\nand desperation were boiling\nwithin him. Suddenly, the 36\nhours of labour she had just\nendured seemed to be unduly\ntruncated. Melancholically\nhe considered the irony of\n\u2018unduly truncated\u2019.\nHe handed back his diminutive newborn, the symbol of\nhis woes, into the welcoming\narms of his wife.\nOK, there was definitely a\nshadow loitering outside the\ndoor.\nA flash of metal.\nYet this measure has had\nfar-reaching effects. Mothers\nare increasingly likely to have\nan abortion if their child is\nfemale due to the desire for\na male heir, causing a predominantly male society to\ndevelop. The restrictions also\nmean that no child can have\nbrothers, sisters, cousins,\naunts or uncles, causing a\nloss of family values in the\ncommunity. Also, the reduction in the mean number of\nchildren per family will create an ageing population with\nfewer able-bodied people to\nsupport it.\n\u201cThis is the end of my life\nas I know it,\u201d he pleaded to\nno-one in particular.\nHis wife misunderstood.\n\u201cWhat, having a daughter?\u201d\nshe asked absurdly.\n\u201cNo, never being able to\nprocreate again\u201d her husband retorted. \u201cI know what\nthey\u2019ll do. Come in here any\nminute; drag me off for the\nsnip. Impotency will consume the rest of my life! One\nchild and then that\u2019s it! Your\nlicense is revoked, no more\nchildren, no more sex life.\nEver!\u201d\nHis voice rose in pitch,\nprobably in premonition of\nthe fate that awaited him.\n\u201cThey have no right! All\nthese childbirth controls, all\nthese limits. No wonder there\nare so many prostitutes!\nNo wonder sexually transmitted diseases are rife! No\nwonder abortions are ram-pant! No wonder there are\nso many orphaned children,\nabandoned by their parents\nas they symbolise the true\nextent of the restrictions\nimposed upon them! Orwell\nhad it right! The death of the\norgasm!\u201d\nYet perhaps the most damaging aspect of birth control\nis the infringement on human\nrights. Is it fair to dictate to\na couple how many children\nthey are allowed to have? And\nwhat of the future, when the\never-increasing population\nneeds sterner restraints. Will\nstricter childbirth policies be\nintroduced?\nIn his controversial and\nemphatically prophetic\nnovel 1984, George Orwell\ndescribes a totalitarian state\nwhereby the Party, the force\nbehind the \u2018Big Brother\u2019 slo-gan, creates an environment\nwhereby sex is demonised\nand hated, where family values are destroyed as children\nare indoctrinated to become\ncompletely subservient to the\nParty, and love is annihilated\nas an emotion. The motivation for the hate campaign\nagainst these essentially\nhuman tendencies is so that\neveryone is entirely devoted\nonly to the Party, and this is\nwhere all their desire is chan-nelled. The drive is towards\na social system resembling\na bee hive, where all members are only concerned with\nthe welfare of the queen and\nignore any desire of their\nown.\nAt that moment four men,\ntwo wearing white coats,\ntwo wielding batons, erupted\ninto the room and swallowed\nthe new father up into a sea\nof limbs and wood. He struggled convulsively until one\nof the doctors (he hoped they\nwere doctors) injected something into his neck. Instantly\nhe went limp. Unable to\nprotest either physically or\nverbally, he was carried in\ntriumph into an adjoining\nroom, where the last rites of\nhis sex life were performed.\nHis wife, meanwhile,\ndrew her child closer to her.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cat least\nnow I might get some decent\nnights\u2019 sleep.\u201d\nAlthough I do not suggest\nthat China is on the verge of\ntotalitarianism, the similarities exist, and should be considered a warning, allowing\nus to avoid the unwitting path\nto subservience and dictatorship of ideals. Other birth\ncontrol measures, such as\nthrough education, hormone\nmanipulation and mechanical\nbarriers (such as condoms)\nneed to be introduced and, if\nalready present, more enthusiastically enforced so as to\navoid any violation of human\nrights. Personally I believe\nthat it is education and\nresponsibility that will \u2018solve\nthe problem\u2019.\nA nation of only children: China\u2019s \u2018one child per family\u2019\npolicy has had far-reaching effects\nNews\nin brief\nUS space shuttle\ncrew eager to\nreturn to flight\nAstronauts assigned to\nNASA\u2019s first space shuttle mission since the 2003\nColumbia disaster said they\nare confident mistakes and\ntechnical problems that led\nto that accident are in the\npast. The launch is set for\nmid-May and the crew are\nscheduled to spend 13 days\nin space on a test flight to\npractice inspection procedures and heat shield repair\ntechniques developed since\nthe Columbia accident.\nGerman team\nfinds new way to\nblock HIV\nreplication\nGerman scientists have\nfound a new way to prevent\nthe HIV virus from repli-cating, offering hope in the\nface of the virus\u2019 increasing\nresistance to existing drugs.\nJoachim Hauber, a professor at the Heinrich-Pette\nInstitute in Hamburg, and\nhis team have identified a\nprotein in human cells that\nthe HIV virus uses to reproduce and have run tests on\na chemical that blocks this\nprotein\u2019s action.\nSwift catches first\ncosmic blasts\nThe Swift space telescope,\nlaunched in November, has\nseen its first gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) \u2013 the massive cosmic explosions it was\nbuilt to study. The telescope\ndetected its first burst on 17\nDecember, only a few days\nafter its instruments were\nswitched on. GRBs are the\nmost powerful explosions\nin the Universe, releasing\nmore than one hundred billion times the energy our\nSun emits in a year.\nRats can tell\nthe difference\nbetween human\nlanguages\nRats can use the rhythm of\nhuman language to tell the\ndifference between Dutch\nand Japanese, researchers in Spain reported. Their\nstudy suggests that mammals evolved some of the\nskills underlying the use and\ndevelopment of language\nlong before language itself\nevolved. It is the first time an\nanimal other than a human\nor monkey has been shown\nto have this skill.\nHuygens Friday and the countdown to Titan\nBy Darius Nikbin\nScience Editor\nStop everything you are doing\nright now.\nLaunched on 14 October\n1997,sixyearsontheHuygens\nprobe is set for its arrival\non Titan\u2019s surface. With any\nluck, we should be seeing the\nfirst images and sounds from\nTitan on Friday.\nThe probe will arrive at\nTitan and dive into the atmosphere of Saturn\u2019s largest\nmoon. ESA TV will provide\nextensive live coverage of\nthis event, as detailed on the\nright. All transmission and\nsatellite details are online at\nhttp://television.esa.int.\nCoverage should begin\nfrom 8am on Friday morning\nwhen the Huygens probe is\nbeing switched on from the\nstate of hibernation it has\nbeen in since it separated\nfrom the Cassini mothership\non 24 December 2004.\nAt 9.06am, Huygens is\nscheduled to enter Titan\u2019s\natmosphere at a relatively\nsteep angle of 65 degrees and\na velocity of 6km per second.\nThe probe will then decela-rate to 400 metres per second within 3 minutes before\ndeploying a 2.6m pilot chute\nat about 160km altitude. After\ntwo and a half seconds, the\nprimary parachute will pull\naway and the main 8.3m\ndiameter parachute will open\nto stabilise the probe. From\nthis point on, Huygens will\nbe collecting information on\natmospheric composition\nand dynamics. The data will\nbe transmitted to the Cassini\nmothership which should be\nflying over Titan at a distance\nof 60,000km.\nThe descent will last two\nhours 20 minutes before\nHuygens impacts with the\nsurface of Titan at 6m per\nsecond. If it survives all this,\nHuygens will then have (at\nmost) 130 minutes to directly\ncharacterise Titan\u2019s surface\nbefore its mission is over.\nAlthough there is very little chance that we will have\nimages of giant insects or\nsounds of little green men\nsinging Fly Me To The Moon\ninto the on-board micro-phones, any results will be\nfascinating.\nTitan is bigger than the\nplanet Mercury and slightly\nsmaller than Mars. It has a\nthick hazy nitrogen-based\natmosphere containing\ncarbon-based compounds.\nScientists believe that the\nsimilarities Titan bears with\nthe Earth in terms of its\natmosphere and composition\nwill yield some clues to help\nthem understand how life\nemerges on planets.\nBritish bookies Ladbrokes\nhad set starting odds of\n10,000/1 that the mission\nwould find intelligent life on\nTitan.\nCoverage on ESA TV\nhttp://television.esa.int\nFriday 14 January\n08.00\u201315.30 (GMT)\nHuygens Probe Arrival at Titan\n(four live segments of between\n30 and 75 minutes\u2019 duration)\n12.30\u201313.00\nMedia briefing on Huygens\nmission status\n17.15\nMedia briefing on Huygens\nmission outcome\n22.00\u201322.20\nReview of the day: First images\nand sounds from Huygens (?)\nSaturday 15 January\n10.00\u201311.15\nMedia briefing on Huygens\nscience data This is Titan: a picture taken of Titan before Huygens was\ndispatched from its mothership, Cassini\n\n"

    "content": "After last week\u2019s rather long and\nmostly quite pointless ramblings, I\nthouught that it would only be fair if\nI kept it shorter and to some sort of\npoint this week. The topic is Wagner,\nand in particular the new Ring cycle\nat the Royal Opera house... but you\nmay have already guessed that from\nthe headline.\nThere have been a number of\nnew Ring cycles around the world\nrecently, in fact the one at the Royal\nOpera is in direct competition with\nthe English National Opera\u2019s own\nproductions, the most troubled so\nfar being that for Bayreuth. For\nthose that don\u2019t know, Bayreuth\nis the annual Wagner festival in\nGermany. Performances are held\nin a specially designed theatre,\nbut unfortunately it is rumoured\nto be somewhat uncomfortable.\nBayreuth, apart from being plagued\nby an assortment of Wagner family problems, suffered something of\na set-back when their director for\nthe planned 2006 Ring cycle quit\nlast year. However, a replacement\nhas just been found in the form\nof the German playwright Tankred\nDorst.\nEnough of other people\u2019s prob-lems; back to the Royal Opera. Last\nnight was the final night of the first\nrun of performances of the first\npart of the Ring, Das Rheingold,\nand as luck would have it disaster struck. Things were even worse\nthan when Mutti pulled out of La\nForza del Destino earlier on in the\nseason. This time, Bryn Terfel lost\nhis voice, confirmed an hour before\nperformance. Terfel had been singing the role of Wotan, a rather central role in the opera. Fortunately\nthe evening was rescued by the\nchance appearance of Sir Donald\nMacIntyre, a great Wotan of the\npast, in town. So, the show did go\non, with MacIntyre singing from\nthe pit and Terfel miming on stage.\nNot the ideal set-up, but this was\nnot the least of the production\u2019s\nproblems.\nThe much-awaited new produc-tion, directed by Keith Warner and\ndesigned by Stefanos Lazaridis,\nwas something of a let down. The\nopening sequence where the Rhine\nMaidens taunt the dwarf Albrecht\nworked well, but that was about it.\nTo match the sweeping music of\nWagner, one would expect equally\nsumptuous sets, however, in the\nage of stylised re-thinking, we were\npresented with a black and white\nnightmare. The palace of the gods\nwas barely approaching majestic,\nand Nibelheim was just unpleasant beyond words \u2013 a vile vision of\na morgue with lobotomised slaves\nbeing electricuted, not to mention\nthe ridiculous box with shiny bits on\nit that was meant to be the all-pow-erful helmet with which Albrecht\nwas going to bring the world to\nsubmission.\nAll I can do is hope that the next\ninstallment, Die Walkure, is an\nimprovement, and that Bryn Terfel\nwill not lose his voice again, as I\u2019d\nactually like to hear his Wotan.\nThe Royal Academy is currently\nhosting an exhibition of the work of\nthe British painter and printmaker\nWilliam Nicholson (1872\u20131949). The\nexhibition closes very soon, on 23\nJanuary, and so if you want to see\nwhat is actually a rather pleasant\nexhibition you\u2019d better get a move\non.\nThis is the first major review of\nNicholson\u2019s work in London since\n1942, when the artist was still alive.\nThe exhibition is comprised of 68\npaintings and also includes more\nthan 50 prints as well as some of\nthe books he provided illustrations\nfor, including the classic by Margery\nWilliams, The Velveteen Rabbit, the\nalmost criminally sad children\u2019s\nbook.\nNow, while the illustrations in\nThe Velveteen Rabbit are beautiful and touching, what one is most\nlikely to recognise of the works on\ndisplay are Nicholson\u2019s prints, particularly if your family or any of your\nfriends\u2019 families had a penchant\nfor Victoriana. The series of prints\nfor the artist\u2019s The Alphabet (1898)\nare the source of what are possibly\nNicholson\u2019s most iconic images, not\nto mention some rather amusing\nexamples for words beginning with\nthe letters of the alphabet: Y is for\nYokel.\nThe early part of Nicholson\u2019s\ncareer was spent as a printmaker and poster designer. In 1891,\nNicholson enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie\nJulian in Paris, and while in Paris\nhe was to meet fellow artist James\nPryde with whom he collaborated\nwith under the name of Beggarstaff\nBrothers, producing the design for\na series of posters. This was during\nthe time of the grand print revival\nin Europe, led by the Frenchman\nToulouse Lautrec. Work from this\nperiod in the exhibition includes the\nBeggarstaff Brothers\u2019 poster for\nDon Quixote (1895) which is striking\nin the simplicity of the design.\nWhile Nicholson may be most\nremembered for his prints and post-ers, the exhibition does focus on his\npaintings.\nA wide range of paintings are\nincluded in the exhibition, however,\nhis still-lifes are consistently his\nbest work. One begins to think that\nthe description of his landscapes\nas \u2018strikingly minimalist\u2019 is something of a cover-up for some rather\nuninspiring works, however, the still\nlifes are magnificent in their use\nof colour and texture as well as\nthe simplicity of their composition.\nPortraits are also featured in the\nexhibition, and from the selection\ngiven it is clear that Nicholson had\na fabulous talent for capturing the\nmoment that was only in its nascent\nstages as he was nearing the end\nof his life. His paintings at the time\nof World War I, though not strictly\nportraits in a traditional sense, are\nmesmerising.\nThe exhibition is compact, as is\nusual for the Sackler Wing, but highly recommended; the art is interest-ing, and it is a small exhibition and\nso one won\u2019t be horribly worn out by\nthe culture (as you may well be by\nthe new exhibition to be held in the\nMain Galleries, Turks).\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\n\u25cf The Raphael exhibition at the\nNational Gallery will be closing this\nSunday. Tickets for this exhibiition\ncost \u00a34 for students or \u00a39 at full\nprice. I do suggest booking tickets in advance, unless you particularly like queuing. Booking information is available online at www.\nnationalgallery.org.uk.\nIt might not strictly be pantomime\nseason any more, but Dramsoc\nbring you a late festive treat with\ntheir performance of Jack and the\nBeanstalk next week. Normally at\nthis point in an article, it\u2019s traditional to give a brief resum\u00e9 of the plot,\nbut frankly if you don\u2019t know what\nhappens in Jack and the Beanstalk\nyou should probably be complaining to your parents about having a\nneglected childhood!\nHowever, I guess there are a\nfew differences in this production\nso here is a (very) basic storyline:\nJack and his mother are going to\nbe thrown out of their house by the\nnasty Squire Macguire (boo hiss)\nas they can\u2019t pay the rent. In an\nattempt to raise money, Jack takes\ntheir cow to market and swaps it\nwith the evil Witch Whey for a bag of\nbeans (stupid boy!)\nThe beans turn out to be magic,\na mighty beanstalk grows and up\nit climb Jack, his mother, the princess Penelope, a blind royal servant\ncalled Stammers, Jack\u2019s sister Jill\nand her boyfriend (simple) Simon\n(yes there is also a pieman, and pies,\nmany pies!)\nAt the top is a giant\u2019s castle, home\nto Mr and Mrs Giant (who aren\u2019t very\ngiant), Captain Detergiant (evil captain of the giant\u2019s guards who looks\nquite a bit like Squire Macguire (boo\nhiss!) and his evil henchmen (or\nshould that be man) Pungiant and\nStringiant (mutants that resemble\n\u2018Two-bad\u2019 from He-Man).\nThe evil captain then steals the\ngolden goose from the giants and\nforces it to lay golden eggs by playing with a harp. It\u2019s up to Jack\nto save the giants, save the goose\nand harp (God only knows what\nDertergiant might do to them, he\nis a very naughty man), save his\nhouse, save his loyal cow Annabelle\nand win the heart of the princess.\nWill good triumph over evil? What\ndo you think?\nWell there you go, you are probably\nthinking, now I don\u2019t need to come, I\ncan guess what happens! But you do\nneed to come, because this review\nwasn\u2019t very funny and the actual\npantomime is! There are some great\ncomedy moments (including some\nwonderful \u2018Imperial\u2019 jokes), some\nbrilliant characters and people in\nvarious animal costumes. Also, one\nnight, the actual author of this ver-sion, an ex-Imperial student him-self, is popping along, so you get to\nsee a man tearing out his hair as he\nsees what we have done to his masterpiece (at no extra cost!)\nIf you like saying \u2018It\u2019s behind you\u2019\nand \u2018Oh no you didn\u2019t\u2019, and if you\nenjoy seeing men dressed up and\nwomen and women dressed up as\nmen (and lets face it, who doesn\u2019t)\nthen there is definitely no better way\nto spend an evening. In addition to\nthis, all the profits are going to the\nTsunami relief appeal, so by putting\nyourself through a couple of hours\nof mild pain you\u2019ll be helping people\nwho are suffering far more.\nJack and the Beanstalk is on at the\nUnion Concert Hall from Wednesday\n19 to Saturday 22 January, starting\nat 7.30 each night. Tickets cost \u00a34.50\nfor students or \u00a36 others. Advance\nbookings can be made at www.dram-soc.org (book early to avoid disap-pointment!).

    "content": "Humanity\u2019s number one enemy is alive and becoming stronger. Kathryn Lougheed\nreports on the threat of tuberculosis and explains how people can go about defeating it\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 13 January 2005\n4\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAsk many and they will tell\nyou that tuberculosis (TB)\nhas come back. The sad truth\nis that it never went away.\nThis disease has been killing us for thousands of years,\nwith evidence of TB being\nfound in Egyptian mummies dated from 2400BC.\nThankfully, we are now a little\nbetter equipped in our fight\nagainst TB than our ancestors were, as in the last 50\nyears effective drugs and vaccines have been developed.\nThe 1970s saw Britain arrogantly believe that TB was no\nlonger a threat, but, since the\n1980s, the disease has undergone a resurgence, both here\nand abroad. In fact, the rate\nof incidence in London has\nincreased so rapidly in the\nlast ten years that the city is\nnow the TB capital of Europe.\nThe TB burden of some North\nLondon boroughs, such as\nHackney and Newham, is\nequivalent to that of Russia,\nChina and Brazil \u2013 countries\nthat have some of the highest\nrates in the world.\nAround two million people\ndie of TB each year, making it\nthe biggest single infectious\ndisease killer in the world. The\nWorld Health Organisation\n(WHO) estimates that\nevery second, someone new\nbecomes infected. The causative agent of TB is a bacterium\ncalled Mycobacterium tuber-culosis, spread via inhalation\nof droplets expelled when\nan individual with the active\ndisease coughs or sneezes.\nSome of the symptoms that\nare seen in someone with an\nactive infection are coughing,\nshortness of breath, fatigue,\nweight loss and fever.\nSo how is it that despite the\nbest efforts of so many, the\nworld is still plagued by TB?\nThe problem is that this bacterium is a lot smarter than it\nlooks. As well as possessing\nnumerous methods to avoid\nand subvert the host immune\nsystem, it also knows when it\nis not winning and can chose\nto go into hiding. Somehow\nthe bacterium enters a persistent state in which it does\nnot really do very much; it\njust waits patiently for its\nenemy, the immune system,\nto become compromised.\nAround one third of the\nworld\u2019s population harbour\na latent TB infection. This\nobviously represents a huge\nreservoir of potentially infectious bacteria and presents\na major obstacle to any effort\nto eradicate the disease. It\nwould be invaluable if we\ncould develop drugs aimed at\nthese persistent bacteria and\neffectively treat those with\nlatent infections.\nDeteriorationoftheimmune\nsystem can often trigger M\ntuberculosis to make the transition from latent infection to\nactive TB. This weakening\ncan occur through ageing or,\nincreasingly more often, upon\ninfection with HIV.\nOnly 10% of those infected\nwith TB will go on to develop\nthe active form of the disease during their lifetime,\nbut this percentage increases\ndramatically in those infected\nwith the HIV virus. In Africa,\nHIV is the single most important factor in the increase in\nTB cases observed during\nthe last decade. TB and HIV\nare a lethal combination, and\nwe cannot hope to beat one\nwithout also attacking the\nother. The huge number of\nHIV cases in South and East\nAsia has led to a huge proportion of the total TB cases\nbeing found in these countries alone.\nIt does not help that these\npeople are some of the poorest in the world, and the loss\nof income associated with TB\ninfection can only increase\npoverty in these communities.\nTreating \u2013 and, more impor-tantly, preventing \u2013 both of\nthese diseases is not exactly\neasy for low income coun-tries. African leaders recently called for more money for\nthe UN\u2019s Global Fund, which\nfights AIDS, TB and malaria.\nAn additional problem\nwith the control of TB is the\nhuge number of displaced\nand needy migrants around\nthe world. This number was\nestimated at 20 million during 2003 and, according to\nthe WHO, as many as 50%\nof these people could have\nTB. These mobile populations\npose a problem for the treatment of those infected. Poor\nliving conditions, such as\novercrowding, poor nutrition\nand poor health care, lead to\nthe easy spread of the infectious agent. This appears to\nbe at least part of the reason\nbehind the recent increase in\nTB cases in London. Many\nof the identified cases are\namong immigrants born in\ncountries outside the UK,\nleading to calls for the compulsory screening of all those\nplanning to reside here. It is\na suggestion that has been\ncondemned as extremist, racist and unworkable by some.\nScreening would most probably save lives and slow the\nspread of TB, but whether\nsuch a policy could ever be\nsuccessfully implemented is\ndebatable. Perhaps voluntary\nscreening at GP surgeries\nand hospitals should be made\navailable to allow those at risk\nto decide for themselves.\nEven when TB sufferers\nare identified and treated,\nthe next barrier to the fight\nagainst this disease is the\ncurrent vaccines and treatments available. The protection offered by the current\nBCG vaccine varies greatly\nthroughout populations, and\nwhile it is very good at preventing serious childhood TB,\nadults only have between 0\nand 80% protection from the\nmore common pulmonary\nTB. It comes as a surprise\nto many that, despite receiving the BCG vaccination, they\nare still at risk of catching\nTB. Better education and\nincreased awareness would\nat least lead to more individuals recognising the symptoms and receiving treatment\nbefore the disease spreads\nand infects more.\nOne of the most disturbing trends associated with TB\ntoday is the gradual increase\nin drug resistant strains\nacross the world, leading to\nthe possibility that our current methods of treatment\nwill someday become useless.\nDrug resistance occurs as a\nresult of evolution. Within a\npopulation of bacteria, there\nwill naturally be variants that\npossess unusual qualities,\nsuch as resistance to antibi-otics. Treatment with an antibiotic does not itself cause\nresistance, rather it selects\nbacteria that are able to tolerate the drug and a \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 scenario\nresults in resistant variants\nmultiplying to take over the\nentire population. Multi-Drug\nResistant strains (MDR-TB)\ncannot be treated by at least\nthe two most important anti-TB drugs, Rifampicin and\nIsoniazid. In response to this\nproblem, 2004 saw Latvia\nand the WHO jointly open\nEurope\u2019s first centre to fight\nthe spread of MDR-TB.\nThe emergence of resistant\nstrains is partly as a result\nof inadequate or incomplete\ntreatment of the disease. It\ntakes around nine months of\nchemotherapy to completely\nbanish TB, and when many\nfeel better after just a few\nmonths, they stop taking the\nantibiotics. Furthermore,\nin countries where anti-TB\ndrugs are not readily availa-ble, expensive and incorrectly used, complete treatment\nof infected individuals does\nnot always occur.\nThe aid agency M\u00e9decins\nSan Fronti\u00e8res recently stated that drug resistant TB and\nHIV pose major threats, and\nthey believe that inadequate\nattempts to control the disease mean it is now spiralling\nout of control. The charity\ncalled for massive investment\nin the development of new\ndiagnostic tests and drugs.\nThe problem of drug resistance is not limited to TB. So\ncalled \u2018superbugs\u2019 have been\nwell documented in the press,\nwith the public becoming\nincreasingly worried about\nthehospital-associatedMRSA\ninfection. Again, this problem\nis the result of incorrect use\nof antibiotics, both in human\nand veterinary medicine.\nFor many years, there was\na culture of taking antibiotics for every cold we became\ninfected with. Doctors were\nonly too happy to prescribe\nantibiotics, despite the fact\nthat viral infections do not\nrespond to antibiotic treatment and this course of action\nonly results in the strengthening of potentially infectious\nbacterial populations present\nin the patient. Doctors have\nnow cut down on the number\nof prescriptions they write;\nunfortunately it is too late to\nprevent the emergence of a\nnumber of drug resistant bacterial strains that are much\nharder to treat.\nTreating drug resistant\nTB takes much longer than\ntreatment of the non-resist-ant strains, and the drugs\nare significantly more expen-sive. Once the drug resistant strains have emerged,\nthey are spread through\nthe air as for non-resistant\nTB. More and more of the\nnewly detected infections\ninvolve these new variants.\nTherefore, detection of drug\nresistance is important in the\nfight against TB as it allows\nthe cocktail of drugs used to\ntreat these infections to be\nvaried as resistance is detect-ed. However, in some serious MDR-TB cases, antibiotic\ntreatment becomes intolerable and surgery presents a\nbetter alternative. The early\n20th century saw removal\nof parts of the infected lung\nas the only resort for seriously ill TB patients, and it\nis extremely worrying that\nthe situation today sees us\ndesparately moving back\ntowards this somewhat barbaric method of treatment.\nRapid diagnosis of MDR-TB\ncan prevent further people\nbeing infected by the suffer-ers, hopefully slowing the\nspread of these strains.\nPrevention is better than\ncure when considering drug\nresistant TB, and worldwide\nTB control is important. The\nDOTS (Directly Observed\nTreatment Short course) pro-gramme, implemented by the\nWHO, is an internationally\nrecognised approach to TB\ncontrol. It involves government commitment to TB con-trol, better detection of those\ninfected, treatment with high\nquality drugs, recording and\nreporting of cases, and supervised taking of the chemotherapy for at least the first\ntwo months of treatment.\nHowever, a recent Nature\nMedicine paper used mathematical modelling to suggest that MDR-TB will in\nthe future become a major\npublic health threat despite\nthe current attempts at con-trol. Their argument was that\ndespite the lower fitness of\nmany MDR-TB strains compared with the fitter non-resistant strains, the rare\nemergence of relatively fit\nMDR-TB strains would be\nenough to allow these bacteria to eventually out compete\nthe less fit MDR-TB and non-resistant populations. This\nis obviously an extremely\nworrying prospect, making\nthe development of new and\nmore effective drugs and vaccines vital.\nIt appears that drug resist-ance, HIV and poverty have\nall played a role in the current\nTB situation. I personally am\namazed by this bacterium that\nhas survived among humans\nfor thousands of years, but\nwhen you consider the 16 million people worldwide with\nactive disease, and the one to\ntwo billion with a latent infec-tion, eradication of TB cannot\ncome too soon. For the time\nbeing, however, it appears\nthat TB is here to stay.\n\u201cTB and HIV are a\nlethal combination, and\nwe cannot hope to beat\none without also\nattacking the other.\u201d\nTB or not TB: is this a global epidemic?\nTuberculosis: 1-2 billion people have the latent infection, 14 million have the active\ndisease, and around 2 million die from it every year\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cOne of the most\ndisturbing trends\nassociated with TB\ntoday is the gradual\nincrease in drug\nresistant strains...\u201d\n\u201c...the situation today\nsees us desparately\nmoving back towards\nthis somewhat barbaric\nmethod of treatment.\u201d\n\n"

Proposed compensation\npayments and cash advances have been slow in reaching many workers suffering\nfinancial hardship, while others have been paid incorrect\namounts.\nA considerable proportion\nof Imperial students work\nfor the College part time, in\nareas such as Conferences,\nICT, Southside bar and the\nstudents\u2019 union. For many,\nthe work is an essential part\nof student life, without which\nthey would be unable to fund\ntheir education.\nMalcolm Aldridge, the\nCollege\u2019sFinancialController,\nsaid that the change from\nweekly to monthly pay had\nbeen made for two main\nreasons. Firstly, he said, \u201cin\ntime, it will enable us to save\nmoney on payroll processing\u201d.\nSecondly, \u201cquite a large proportion of the student labour\nforce are also recipients of\nstudent bursaries\u201d, which are\npaid monthly, and there were\nproblems co-ordinating these\nwith weekly pay.\nOne student worker told\nFelix: \u201cIf I needed money [in\nthe past], I could do some\nwork and have the money\nin my pocket the next week.\nNow I may have to wait six\nweeks to get paid.\u201d\nMr Aldridge responded:\n\u201cThere are some places in\ncentral London that would\npay you within days, but the\noverwhelming majority of\nemployees in this country are\npaid on a monthly cycle.\u201d\nMorten Olesen, an aeronautics student, recently quit\nworking in the Union bar.

I didn\u2019t see the point\nin signing up for regular\nshifts if I couldn\u2019t expect regular pay.\n\u201cAlthough I do understand\nit is much cheaper for the\nCollege to run a monthly\nscheme, they run the risk of\nlosing a lot more part time\nstudent staff as a consequence of this change.\u201d\nMr Aldridge said: \u201cIf we had\nserious difficulty in recruit-ing, we would have to look at\nthis again...

This job\nis supposed to be tailored to\nstudents. The people working\nhere have money problems,\nand this is making things\neven harder.\u201d\nMany employees who\nworked in December will\nnot be paid for that month\nuntil February. Mustafa Arif,\nPresident of Imperial College\nUnion, said this was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and offered cash\nadvances to his staff. Mr\nAldridge said: \u201cI agree, it is\nunreasonable,\u201d and went on\nto explain that this was due\nto problems with the installation of new management\nsoftware.\nMr Arif outlined the Union\u2019s\nposition: \u201cThe pay situation is\ncausing hardship for students\nand headaches for manag-ers. I think the College have\nnow accepted that there is a\nproblem, and I hope we can\nresolve it quickly.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe most galling aspect of this saga is that\nwhilst students have been\nmoved to monthly pay, non-student casuals are still being\npaid weekly.\u201d\nA number of student workers have already told Felix\nthat they have not been paid\nfor several months. Others\nhave been given the wrong\namount.

    "content": "Alexander the not so Great\nSadly, Stone\u2019s \u2018epic\u2019 is a waste of time and money\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFilm listings: see\nWhat\u2019s On, page 10\nOne of the world\u2019s greatest masters\nof war, Alexander the Great conquered the ancient world before the\nage of 30. So how amazing it must\nbe to have an epic that explains\nthe man behind this legend with\na cast list of Hollywood\u2019s best and\nOscar-winning Oliver Stone as the\ndirector.\nThe film follows Alexander all the\nway through his life as his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) fills\nhis head with stories of Achilles\nand the siege of Troy, fuelling his\nimagination and inspiring him\nlater on in his life to conquer and\ndrive his way through the east.\nOlympias is determined to see him\nachieve greatness and turn him\nagainst his father King Philip of\nMacedonia (Val Kilmer). After his\nfather is assassinated, Alexander\nsets out to Persia in order to avenge\nhis death.\nThe film has some beautiful sets,\nparticularly for Persia \u2013 they are\nstunning to look at and the fight\nsequences, yes all two of them, are\nvery impressive. Be warned, though\n\u2013 they do get quite bloody. If you\nweren\u2019t a fan of Kill Bill\u2019s usage\nof spurting blood and hacked off\nlimbs then perhaps this film isn\u2019t\nfor you. Actually, I can also give you\nseveral other reasons not to go and\nsee it.\nHow can I possibly start to tell you\nhow shockingly bad this film was?\nThe script was terrible. There was\nno way for the audience to relate to\nor care for any of the characters. I\nleft the cinema knowing nothing new\nabout this supposedly great man or\nany of his reasons for conquering\nthe rest of the world. Frankly, at the\nend of the film, I didn\u2019t care.\nThe main point of the film seemed\nto be that Alexander liked boys. Was\nit really necessary to keep bringing\nup his bisexuality? And if it was, why\nwas Hephaistion made out to look\nlike a lady boy walking around in\nfeminine robes when he was actually a skilled warrior and commander\nin real life?\nRelationships between men in\nancient Greece were very differ-ent. They went through so much\ntogether \u2013 there was an intimacy\nthat couldn\u2019t be replicated with\nwomen, who were there for sex, and\nchildren. The film made it out to be\nmore sordid, and the sex scene with\nAlexander\u2019s \u2018barbarian\u2019 wife didn\u2019t\nreally help, although the growling\nand naked fighting may appeal to\nsome of you. The words \u2018bouncing\u2019\nand \u2018melons\u2019 come to mind.\nWhat Stone seems to have forgotten is that Alexander had ambition\nthat was driven by figures such as\nAchilles, Heracles and Dionysus.\nHis quest for glory and his need to\nsurpass his heroes was the reason\nwhy he emerged as one of the greatest military geniuses in history, not\nbecause he had an over-bearing\nmother.\nThe film is laughable. Jolie, Kilmer\nand Leto do their best with what\nthey\u2019ve got, but it\u2019s not enough. Their\ncharacters are two-dimensional and\nthey end up playing stereotypes; the\ncrazy snake-handling mother, the\ndrunken tyrannical father and the\neffeminate lover.\nAnd can anyone tell me why the\nGreek have Irish accents? Colin\nFarell sounds surprisingly less\nIrish than the rest of the cast, apart\nfrom the random Scottish guy who\nwants us all to stop our belly-aching.\nConfused? So am I.\nAnother area this film lets you\ndown in is the lack of battle scenes.\nWe never find out why Alexander\nis still remembered today for his\nstrategic tactics. Important historical battles and major events in his\nlife, such as the trek back to Persia\nthrough the desert, have been left\nout. What makes this film even\nworse is that Farrell doesn\u2019t have\nthe right charisma (or acting skills)\nto portray this icon \u2013 he makes him\nout to be some sort of crazed wimp.\nI\u2019m not even going to go into the\nbrainless Matrix-like fight scene\nbetween a horse and an elephant\n\u2013 how moronic can you get? The\nSaving Private Ryan style battle at\nthe end is equally terrible.\nThis film is so ridiculous that it\nwill have you laughing all the way\nthrough, but something tells me that\nwasn\u2019t what Stone intended. Don\u2019t go\nand see this film. It\u2019s a waste of your\ntime and money. Even the comedy\nfactor won\u2019t help you endure three\nhours of this self-indulgent movie.\nHaj Alttahir\nAlexander\nDirector: Oliver Stone\nStarring: Colin Farrell, Jared Leto,\nAngelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Anthony\nHopkins, Jessie Kamm, Connor\nPaolo, Christopher Plummer\nLength: 175 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHIIII\nOne of the rare battle scenes in the disappointing Alexander\n\u201cJolie, Kilmer and\nLeto do their best...\nbut it\u2019s not enough\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 13 January 2005 13\n\n"

GKT have been finalists\nin the ULU Cup for the last\nfive years, are the reigning\nleague and cup champions,\nand last year hammered us\n98-0. We don\u2019t like them very\nmuch.\nAs always with the Virgins\n(Imperial\u2019s women\u2019s rugby\nteam), there was much fun\nto be had before we even got\nto the ground. We shall spare\nthe blushes of everyone who\nwas in the van on the way to\nthe match, as we all revealed\nrather too much about our-selves. Suffice to say that\nsex therapist DangerMouse\nhas a new project to work\non. She has decided to pass\nup the challenging case of\nSpandex, who asked if \u201cTo\nbe a serial monogamist, does\nthat mean you have to be\nfaithful?\u201d Perhaps we should\nhave made her keep her old\nbar name, Whore!\nSo, to the game itself. We\nquickly rucked and mauled\nour way up to their try line,\nand from 5m out Gump took\nthe penalty to crash over for\na try. And then we did the\nsame again; this time prop\nWonkey was screaming \u201cgive\nme the ball!\u201d Try!\nFrom a line out on their\n22m, several phases of play\nfound Wonkey on the wing,\nwho selflessly passed the ball\nto DangerMouse in the dead\nball area, and thus came our\ntoken backs\u2019 try of the game.\nThefinalfewminutesbefore\nhalf time were hair-raising\nto day the least. A succession of penalties were given\nagainst us for not retreating 10m, and pretty soon we\nwere 30m back. GKT found\ntheir winger, beat our guard\nand then raced off down the\ntouchline. A brilliant tackle\nby Tumbles saved us, forcing\nthe winger into touch as she\ntouched down.\nAt the start of the second\nhalf, good hands from the\nbacks let DangerMouse loose\non the wing, who made up\nhalf the pitch for us. This\npassage of play finished with\nFlipper nearly scoring, only\nto have the ball knocked out\nof her hands as she crossed\nthe line.\nGKT opted to run the penalty at the restart, but Gump\nripped the ball in the ensuing\nmaul, popped out the other\nside and just kept on run-ning.\nThanks to Joss\u2019 fine territorial kicking, we gained a\npenalty on their line. One of\ntheirs feigned injury, meanwhile the ref gave Gump the\nnod to take the quick tap and\nscore her third of the after-noon, causing us to to briefly\nconsider the headline \u2018How\nGump Gubbed GKT\u2019.\nIn the final ten minutes,\nthings started to get rather\nheated. Tempers flaired\n\u2013 we\u2019d had enough of their\npinching in the rucks, thank\nyou very much \u2013 and the ref\nseemed determined to even\nthings up a bit. Wonkey was\nsin binned (she was already\non a warning) for body-barg-ing their tiny winger into\ntouch and was off for the\nrest of the game. We were\nback on our line, scrambling\ndefensively to cope with self-inflicted bunching of defenders and a seven-man scrum.\nThe referee erroneously\nawarded a penalty try to GKT\nfor coming through the ruck.\nHonourable mentions must\nalso go to twirly Easy, Beater\nfor playing musical forwards\nthroughout the game, Flipper\nfor coping particularly well\nunder pressure, and loadsa\ntrademark Spandex penalties\n\u2013 she even managed to pass\nthe ball once, which really\nconfused them!\nA dishonourable mention\ngoes to the ref, for being\nthe most sexist buffoon I\u2019ve\nencountered in five years of\nplaying.

    "content": "Business business.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 13 January 2005 3\nUS deficit dips further\nAs the US current account deficit reaches record levels, Numaan\nChaudhry explains why it may not be such a bad thing after all\nA lot of the papers seem to\ntalk about the US current\naccount deficit with great\nemotions and anxiety. But the\nfact is, over a quarter of that\ndeficit is as a result of USbased companies operating\nin countries abroad.\nTrue, the US seems to\nhave an insatiable appetite\nfor imports and currently has\na particularly low savings\nrate. US policy-makers have\nconsidered many options to\ncounter this, including giving tax breaks for exporters\nto make their products more\ncompetitive in a global mar-ketplace, renegotiating bilateral trade agreements to suppress trade barriers, pushing\nfor the Chinese government\nto let the market dictate the\nprice of the Yuan and limiting imports, especially oil and\ngas, by instigating energy-saving programmes.\nBut the benefits of US companies operating outside of\ntheir home market are tre-mendous, including creating\nenormous values for consum-ers, corporations and share-holders.\nToday, nearly 25% of US\nmultinational profits come\nfrom foreign subsidiaries.\nThis adds roughly $2.7 trillion dollars to their market\ncapitalisation, bringing great\nbenefits to shareholders,\nthe vast majority of whom\nare household consum-ers. Expanding into foreign\nmarkets and restructuring\noperations internationally\ncan make multinationals\nmore productive and more\ncompetitive, which would in\nturn allow corporations to\noffer consumers lower prices\nand better quality and, in the\nlong run, add jobs at home.\nThis last step is achieved\nbecause multinationals will\nhave greater funds to invest\nin development opportuni-ties, and for this, recruiting\nwill be inevitable.\nThis trade between foreign\naffiliates, offshore subsidiaries of US-based corporations,\nand US companies and consumers will grow in the years\nto come as companies continue to expand their global\nsales, production and sourcing operations into emerging\nmarkets.\nAny negative net impact\non the trade balance must\ntherefore be weighed against\nthe economic value created\nfrom these activities. It\u2019s very\nsimplistic to assert that the\nrecord-breaking US current\naccount deficit is an indicator\nof a weak economy. Critics of\nthe US deficit need to take a\nglobal, rather than a national,\nview. They should consider\nwhat is necessary for a prosperous economy rather than\none that is heavily indebted.\nAmong these, the Fiscal\ndeficit does need to shrink\nto ensure that the US continues to be a magnet for\nglobal investment and that\nthe dollar remains a favoured\ncurrency. Tax and regulatory\npolicies need to be better\nco-ordinated across nations\nso investment decisions are\nmade on grounds of economic efficiency.\nThe US current account\nhas been consistently in deficit since 1982. Since 1998,\nhowever, it\u2019s growth has rocketed and has reached levels\nunseen before, when looked\nat as a percentage of GDP\n,\nexceeding 5%.\nOne problem with the way\nthe current account deficit\nis measured, however, is that\nit measures just the physical movement of goods either\nside of the market, regardless of the nationality or ownership of either party. This\ncan cause serious mispercep-tions as demonstrated by the\nnext example.\nWhen Ford produces it\u2019s\nvehicles in Mexico, many are\nsold to Mexican consumers\nand this generates income\nand hence profits for the\neconomy. But an excess of\nvehicles are made so that\nthey can be shipped back to\nthe US. See the problem?\nEven though they are produced by a US firm, they are\ncounted as imports.\nAt the same time, foreign\ncompanies such as Toyota\nand BMW produce goods in\nthe US and some of these\nare sent abroad to Canada\nand the links. These are then\ncounted as exports and we\nend up with a very intricate\nweb of global firms \u2018importing\u2019 and \u2018exporting\u2019 to the\nUS.\nIn theory, a current account\ndeficit should adjust itself\nthrough exchange rates. In\nthis case, a deficit causes the\nvalue of the dollar to decline,\nstimulates exports and\nreduced imports. However,\nthe US current account deficit has shown no sign of correcting in the past 2 decades,\neven with the dollar\u2019s decline\nover the past two years.\nIn the first quarter of 2004,\nfor example, the deficit was\n20% higher than in early 2003.\nMany theories are conjured\nup as to the reason behind\nthis tumbling deficit; but\nthe main possible reasons\ninclude foreign government\nintervention, problems in US\ntrade agreements, and the\nrise of multinational organi-sations.\nManyeconomistsagreethat\nthe US trade deficit is unsus-taniable and that adjustment,\nwhen it does occur, could\nbe painful. Since the deficit\nhas been at large for over\na decade, Alan Greenspan,\nhead of the Federal Reserve,\nis indeed concerned with\nthe matter and has issued\nwarnings himself. Although\nhe does not predict catastrophe now or in the future, the\ninevitable adjustment might\ncome in a disruptive form.\nOne such disruption he outlines in a speech in Germany:\n\u201cCumulative deficits, which\nresult in a marked decline of\na country\u2019s net international investment position \u2013 as\nis occurring in the United\nStates \u2013 raise more complex\nissues.\u201d\nBasically, a trade deficit\nneeds to be supported by foreigners investing in the US.\nIf, for example, China suddenly became reluctant to do\nso, the result could be either\na sharp rise in interest or a\nfall in the dollar, which, judging by its current rate, could\nmake its value ridiculously\nlow.\nGreenspan points to the\nUS government to tackle\nthe deficits in its finances as\none step towards recovery.\nPresident Bush, as a result,\nhas said he plans to halve the\ndeficit in the government\u2019s\nfinances. But it is evident\nthat the government will continue borrowing. One blatant\nexample of this is the signing\nin November, by President\nBush, of a new law that will\nallow his government to borrow further $800bn.\nLatest\nfrom the\nSquare\nMile\nDismal Morrison sales\nMorrison, the UK\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket chain,\nreported a poor 0.1% increase\nin like-for-like sales over\nthe core Christmas period.\nDespite the \u00a33bn acquisition\nof Safeway in 2003, Morrison\nhas seen profits fall and its\nmarket share drop since then.\nHowever, no profit warnings\nwere given and the group\nsaid it was \u2018on track\u2019 to meet\nits expectations for the year.\nStore cards get beating\nHigh interest rates and the\nanti-competitive behaviour\nof retailers was the focus of\nattacksbytheUKCompetition\nCommission directed at the\nstore card market. Over 90%\nof this market is controlled by\njust four organizations: GE\nConsumer Finance, Creation\nFinancial Services, HSBC\nand Argos. The commission\nis angry with the fact that\nstore cards charge an average of ten percentage points\nhigher than standard credit\ncards. The variation in APRs\ncan reach double digits. Some\nof the most criticised are:\nM&S 18.9%\nArgos 25.9%\nHabitat 29.0%\nBHS 29.0%\nUK gilt yields dip\nAs last December turned out\nto be the worst Christmas\nseason for a decade, retail\nsales on the whole fell 0.4%\nyear-on-year. This led two-year gilts, the securest form\nof bonds that mature in two\nyears, down 0.5 basis points at\n4.35%. The Bank of England\u2019s\nmonetary policy committee will have a meeting this\nweek regarding interest rates\nspecifically, but there\u2019s little\nchance of the cost of borrowing decreasing. The current\nlevel is 4.75%.\nPS2 sales dive\nYet another consequence\nof the poor Christmas sea-son, Game reported a drop\nof almost one fifth in sales\nas compared to the same\ntime last year. Sony failing to\nsupply enough PS2s, coupled with weak UK consumer\nexpenditure, led Game to\nwarn that annual sales in\n2004 would be lower than in\n2003. Sales should be better\nby mid-2005.\nUS Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan has warned that the deficit in US trade cannot be sustained indefinitely, even\nthough the current account looks set to do so\n\n"

With a\nbig grin on my face, I proudly\ntold them that I was chair\nof the Hyde Park Relays\nCommittee.\n\u201cFantastic, well done,\u201d\nthey\u2019d say, \u201c\u2026er, what is it?!\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I\nwas hearing. This is, after\nall, Europe\u2019s largest student\nrelay race we are talking\nabout!\nWhat was going on? I came\nto the conclusion, after much\nthought I might add, that\neither everybody I met was\njust taking the mickey out\nme (very possible), I\u2019d been\nelected to organise a race that\nwasn\u2019t the one I thought it\nwas, or nobody from Imperial\nactually knew anything about\nthe Hyde Park Relays.\nI decided to investigate why\nthis was and to try to remedy\nthe situation.\nAs the name might suggest,\nthis prestigious race takes\nplace on a traditional course\nin the historic setting of Hyde\nPark, London. Fantastic! Not\nrocket science I know, but\nat least I knew which park\nwe were talking about \u2013 the\none right next to Imperial\nCollege.\nSince its inception in 1949,\nthe race has provided the\nopportunity for thousands of\nstudents from across Europe\nto compete in a friendly yet\ncompetitive atmosphere.\nLast year, we welcomed\nteams from Poland, Holland,\nGermany, France and Spain\nas well as over 100 university\nteams from across the United\nKingdom. In total there were\naround 600 competitors who\nran \u2013 the men each running\nthree miles and the women\nrunning two. Great! It was\nthe race I thought it was!\nThis left me with the\nremaining two thoughts\n\u2013 either people were having a joke at my expense or\nImperial students really did\nnot know anything about the\nevent. Thinking of how I could\nsolve this one, I returned\nto my electrical engineering department for lectures.\nAnd then it hit me: what better place to find out if I was\nbeing mocked than speak to\nstudents in my department\n\u2013 everybody knows that EEE\nstudents don\u2019t have a sense\nof humour between them, so\nI could be quite sure that I\nwould get a serious answer. It\nsoon became clear that most\nstudents had not heard of the\nrace.\nSo why do so few Imperial\nstudents know about the Hyde\nPark Relays? Why didn\u2019t ACC\nteams, departments or lecturers enter?\nThe answer is simple \u2013 we\nhave never asked you to take\npart before! The cross-coun-try club has always promoted this event externally, but\nnever with any real convic-tion, internally. Many of the\nworld\u2019s greatest distance\nrunners have run this race\n\u2018before they were famous\u2019,\nbut hardly any of the greatest\nImperial students have.\nWell, I still intend to make\nthis race the biggest and\nbest yet and I am asking you\nImperial students to help\nme to do this by agreeing to\ntake part. The race, with its\nstart and changeover point\nsituated on the banks of the\nSerpentine in Hyde Park,\nis perfect for those of you\nwho love competition or simply just want to experience\nracing in such a renowned\nand beautiful location. So,\ncome on! Get yourselves a\nteam together and sign up\n\u2013 departments, lecturers and\nhalls teams already have.\nTo encourage you guys to\nput a team in, entry has been\nslashed to half price \u2013 \u00a312 for\na team of six men (or mixed)\nand \u00a39 for a team of four\nwomen (payment by cheque\nonly). This includes the race\n(obviously), some food, potential prizes if you do well (or\nreally badly) and the exclusive after-race party, where\ndBs is, for once, full of men\nand women dancing away\nuntil two in the morning.\nThe only problem is that\nyou will have to move fast.\nEven though the race date is\nSaturday 12 February, entries\nofficially close on 22 January.\nTo get an entry form, call\ninto the Student Activities\nCentre in Beit Quad. For more\ninformation, please visit the\nofficial website, www.union.\nic.ac.uk/hpr, or contact peter.\ndickenson@ic.ac.uk.\nI hope to see you all there\non race day!\nHYDE PARK RELAYS\n\u2018Imperial\u2019s biggest sporting event?\nI\u2019ve never heard of it!\u2019\nRunners\nchange over\nat the Hyde\nPark Relay\nBy Michelle Maloney\nOn Thursday 20 January,\nthe Pinks will be holding an\nevening to raise money for\nBreast Cancer Care in dBs,\nincluding an Ann Summers\nparty and Blind Date.\nPinks are a group of girls\nat Imperial who got together\nto form a social club. Pinks\nis not an official Imperial\nCollege Union club or society;\nit is just a group of girls who\nget together once a week to\nhave a chat and meet new\npeople.\nBreast Cancer Care is the\nUK\u2019s leading provider of\ninformation, practical assistance and emotional support\nfor anyone affected by breast\ncancer. Every year, they\nreach over one million people\nwith breast cancer or breast\nhealth concerns.\nBreast cancer is the most\ncommon cancer in women\n\u2013 nearly one in three cancers\nin women occur in the breast.\nThe lifetime risk is one in\nnine, with 13,000 women dying\nfrom breast cancer in the UK\nin 2002. Only 5-10% of breast\ncancers are hereditary or\ndue to family history, meaning that increasing people\u2019s\nawareness of it is vital.\nFor these reasons, Pinks\ndecided to hold an event\nat Imperial to raise money\nfor the Breast Cancer Care\ncharity. The partnership that\nthey have with Ann Summers\n(10% of the sales are donated)\nseemed to provide an excellent opportunity to have an\nevening at Imperial solely for\nwomen. Although some people may be offended by the\nnature of an Ann Summers\nparty, it is Pinks\u2019 opinion\nthat it will be an excellent\nevening and a great novelty\nfor Imperial women.\nThe evening starts with a\ntalk from a Breast Cancer\nCare representative at\n7.00pm. This is followed by\nthe very strictly girls-only\nAnn Summers party. Later\non, we are auctioning off\nsome of Imperial\u2019s finest\nbachelors and having our\nvery own Blind Date, also\nto raise money for the char-ity. Throughout the evening\nthe Pinks (easy to recognise\n\u2013 look for fairy wings and pink\nt-shirts) will be selling Breast\nCancer Care pins and taking\ndonations.\nTickets are \u00a33 in advance\nand \u00a33.50 on the door, and\ninclude entry to the raffle.\nPINKS\nBe tickled Pink in support of\nBreast Cancer Care\n\n"

Today, he writes exclusively for Felix\nI read with interest Felix\u2019s coverage\nof my case and the dramatic meetings that were held to campaign for\nmy justice. I would like to begin by\noffering my heartfelt gratitude to\nall those who have and are still supporting me, especially those who do\nnot even know me personally.\nSome of you raised concerns that\nyou did not want to get involved with\nthe campaign because it was \u2018too\npolitical\u2019. On the one hand, one could\nargue that campaigning against student top-up fees is also political,\nbecause it does not directly concern Imperial\u2019s students of today\n\u2013 it concerns future generations of\nundergraduates. The good nature\nof human conscience dictates that\nwe will always wish better for our\nfuture generations than what we\nhad ourselves.\nOn the other hand, I don\u2019t really\nblame you for not wishing to support\nmy campaign. I mean, who would\nwant to support someone who could\nbe planning to blow you to bits or\nsomeone who is, as on The London\nEvening Standard\u2019s front page of 7\nOctober 2004, \u201cBin Laden\u2019s London\nGeneral\u201d?\nYou see, not very long ago, I\nwas like you. When I saw dozens\nof Muslims (mainly North Africans\nand asylum seekers) being rounded\nup in Britain post 9/11, I myself was\nreluctant to campaign for them. I\nthought: \u201cThere is no smoke without\nfire. Maybe these people did have\nexplosives and terrorist plans. The\npolice don\u2019t just lock people up for\nnothing. I mean, how come it hasn\u2019t\nhappened to me?\u201d\nAnd then it happened to me.\nI saw for myself the \u2018fire\u2019 upon\nwhich the smoke of my arrest was\nbased: my father\u2019s 1973 tourist brochure of the Empire State Building,\na 9/11 documentary DVD that was\nscreened on national TV, and other\n\u2018evidence\u2019. However, none of this\nshould come as a surprise to any-one. After all, we live in an era where\ncountries go to war, destroy homes,\ncreate orphans and kill thousands of\npeople, based on reasons that turn\nout to be lies. Do you think that it is\nbeyond such people to imprison a\nhandful of individuals based on lies?\nThey are capable of anything.\nHaving now spent five months in\nprison, I am trying to make use\nof my time. I don\u2019t have a guilty\nconscience weighing on my mind\nlike other prisoners have, simply\nbecause I know, and God knows,\nthat I am not a terrorist and that I\nhave not done anything wrong or\nillegal. That is what matters to me\nmore than what others think. And I\nwill have my day, for sure, no doubt\nabout it. There is a saying in the\nEast that \u201cthe tongue of a lie is very\nlong, but its lifespan is short\u201d. The\nlie of the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq eventually came out,\nalbeit a few years on. Likewise, the\ntruth will come out one day, and\nthe liars and the hypocrites will be\nexposed.\nThere is nothing wrong if you do\nnot wish to support my campaign,\nbecause you are entitled to your\nown views. However, I would humbly request you not to prevent those\nwho wish to campaign for my plight\nfrom doing so. After all, they could\nturn out to be in the right and the\ntruth could turn out to be on their\nside.\nBritish Political Prisoner Babar\nAhmad MX5383\nHMP Woodhill, MK4 4DA\nwww.freebabarahmad.com\nBABAR AHMAD\nOn 25 January 1885, General\nCharles G Gordon completed his\nfinal diary entry, poured his last gin\nand tonic and strolled across the\nbalcony of the palace of Khartoum.\nStretching out in front of him, the\ngreat city of the Nile had been overrun by Madhists. His dream of a\ngreat Saharan kingdom for Queen\nVictoria was in tatters: Britain was\nlosing the Sudan. His incarceration\nnearly over, the general loaded his\npistol and turned to face the door:\n\u201cBloody dervishes,\u201d he muttered.\nIt took a few years for Gordon\u2019s\n\u2018murder\u2019 to be avenged, and 14\nyears in total before Sudan officially\nbecame a British colony. As the culmination of the scramble for Africa,\nthe race for the Sudan became a\nmatter of national pride, frequently\noccupying the front pages of the\nEuropean newspapers at the time.\nBritain got there first, Sudan turned\nfrom white to pink on the political map, and a disgruntled France\nwas given help colonising Morocco\nto stop her whingeing. A FrancoEnglish war was only narrowly\navoided, and within a few years the\nEntente Cordiale was signed.\nToday, interest in Sudan is low.\nThis is despite what, according to\nthe UN, is one of \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest humanitarian disasters\u201d happening within its borders. Perhaps\nit is because its vast sands turned\nout to be resource poor and its current exports to the west are insig-nificant. The US and Europe delay\nintervention and sanctions while\nan estimated one million refugees\nstruggle to survive famine and dis-ease. As news of the Sudan crisis\nslips from the press, it appears that\nethnic cleansing does not shock\nus as much when it happens to\nAfricans.\nA sincere-looking Jack Straw\nappeared on BBC News over a\nmonth ago to express his \u201cextreme\nconcern\u201d at recent events in the\nregion, but the Foreign Secretary\nhas not done anything to improve\nthe situation since. Yet, the arrival of the new year must galvanise\naction.\nOn 1 January 2005, Britain took\nover the presidency of the G8 industrial nations for 12 months \u2013 what\nwill be \u201ca make or break year for\ndevelopment\u201d according to the\nChancellor. Britain has an opportunity to use this position to increase\nthe foreign aid given to developing\ncountries by the other G8 nations.\nFor years, Sudan has been a forgotten slab of Africa, an arbitrarily drawn shape conjured up in a\nEuropean office, its straight-line\ninternational borders a sad relic of\nits colonial past and the General\nGordons of the 19th century.\nRelatively poor in resources,\nSudan serves little use to the West,\nand the genocide of its people\napparently does not merit military\nintervention. The West claims that it\nhas learnt from Rwanda, but it must\nnot sweep Sudan under the same\nAfrican carpet.\nBritain\u2019s leadership of the G8\ngroup provides a real chance to\nassist a continent it helped to carve\nup and exploit, and it should start by\nseriously addressing the Sudan cri-sis. It is our government\u2019s responsibility to make the most of this oppor-tunity. Only then can we begin to\nheal this \u2018scar on our conscience\u2019.\nHumanitarian crisis in Sudan\nFollowing ethnic cleansing, millions of Sudanese people suffer from famine and disease.\nIain Taylor explains why the West must not forget this former British colony\nRoom bookings\nDear Editor,\nI would like to bring up the sad and\nsorry state of the room bookings in\nthe Union this term. Also last term.\nIn fact, most of the time.\nI am directing this year\u2019s pan-tomime, and with my brave band\nof actors I struggle through our\nscript in various rooms across the\nCollege.\nLast term, I was cramming 25-30 people into rooms in the Royal\nSchool of Mines building, because\nthe Union could offer me nothing,\neven with plenty of warning. This\nterm, I booked as soon as it is pos-sible, to find not only that external people have the places before\nwe, students of the union, can book\nthem, but also I can be offered barely\nany space at all. Seminar Room 2 for\n30 people? Who are trying to act?\nThis situation would be OK if the\nUnion was full to bursting, in fact\nI would have been grateful for a\nroom that everyone could find eas-ily. But what do I find on Thursday\nnight? dB\u2019s and the UCH are both\ntotally empty! Had I not thought of\nlooking around the building briefly,\nmy merry band would have been\non each others laps while the two\nvenues with lots of space and proper\nstages were locked and silent. Does\nthis sound wrong to anyone?\nA Disgruntled Director\nExam anguish\nThe two-week holiday was particularly short this year, and many\nrepresentatives and ordinary students raised this with me last term.\nHowever, for various logistical rea-sons, the term dates are provisionally set ten years in advance by\nthe Academic Registrar, and confirmed by Senate (the College\u2019s sovereign academic body) two years in\nadvance. Therefore, whilst it was\nparticularly unfortunate that this\nimpacted badly on those with exams\nor coursework deadlines, there was\nnothing that could be done about\nthe length of the vacation at such\nshort notice. However, thanks to the\nvigilance and persistence of fourth\nyear Aeronautics students, the\ndepartment agreed to put back the\nexams by two days, allowing a little\nextra revision time. As with all these\nthings, the sooner a potential problem is brought to my (or one of my\nreps\u2019) attention, the more likely it is\nthat we will be able to change it.\nSam Rorke\nDeputy President (Education and\nWelfare)\nBabar Ahmad\nDear Editor,\nCorrection: Babar was still a member of staff when he was arrested\non Exhibiton Road having just left\nhis workplace, Imperial College. It\nseems that some have been reading the inaccurate reports by media\noutlets that follow the notion of\n\u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d when\nit comes to terror arrests etc.\nYes there are several organisations that are standing by Babar in\nhis fight for justice. However, perhaps if Babar Ahmad was your relative or close friend you would think\ndifferently and try to rally all the\nsupport you could get.\nThis campaign is not just about\nBabar, it is about gross abuse of\nour basic human rights and civil\nliberties. In the name of this War on\nTerror, the government is bending\nall the rules and demolishing the\nfoundations of this very democracy\nwe fought so hard to get. This is a\nmatter that affects all the citizens\nof this country, students and non-students. There is life beyond IC for\nits students.\nI suggest you first read his side of\nthe story on www.freebabarahmad.\ncom. Also, there is going to be a documentary about Babar\u2019s campaign\non Wednesday 26 January, 10pm,\nBBC2. It is important to look at both\nsides of every story before we judge\nanything.\nZara\nDear Editor,\nI believe that the Union represents\nonly the existing students of the\nCollege. There are other groups that\ncan campaign for that person [Babar\nAhmad]. People who are interested\non that case can form a group and\ncampaign on their own.\nPan\n\u25cf These comments on\nBabar Ahmad are taken from\nwww.felixonline.co.uk.
