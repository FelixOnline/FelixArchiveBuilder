There are still a number of clubs and societies that have not given me any information. All information is required by WEDNESDAY,10 th October.\nHall Dinners\nThere are weekly, sub sidi sed dinners held normally\nin the Main Dining Hall,\nUnion. They cost 9 5 p for\nstudents, sherry being a further 5 p and wines extra.\nThey always consist of at\nleast three courses and are\nwell above the standard of\nthe average Mooney me a j.

Wadsworth,\nHon. Sec. I.C. UStalinists meaning of free discuss w n SOCIALIST FORUM\nTuesday 9th October\n1 p.m. EE408\nROBIN\nBLACKBURN will be speaking on the\ncurrent situation in\nChile.\nBiackham is of LSE fame\nand a member of the international Marxist Group\nALSO a Speaker from the\n\"Morning Star\".\nIn July i the Stalinist s Tenth World Youth Festival was held in Berlin. Delegates from140 countries attended what was promised to be\" eventful days of friendly, candid discussion\", according to Erich Honecker in his opening speech. The MorningStar on August1 st said:\" One of the most popular aspects of the festival programme is i the' 'Free\nPlatform' Where delegates open up any questions affecting young people. Here delegates are listening to one of the speakers. In the background are the boxes handling simultaneous translations\", in la caption to a picture of a discussion seminar. It all sounded very' free' and' democratic' in theory, but then the practice of the Stalinist s has always been divorced from their left phrases as Peter Tatchell, ia member of the British delegation and representing the Gay Liberation Front, soon found out to b is cost. The GIF bad specially prepared a leaflet putting their aims to the Festival:\"' Radical homosexuals are committed to a socialist revolution because it alone gives the potential to revolution is e interpersonal relationships: to liberate them from economic restraints and exploitation by capitalism\". It went on to emphasise GL F's solidarity with black people, trade unionists, the unemployed and anti imperialist struggles. A certain amount of criticism was levelled at\" communist comrades for leaving capitalist sexual morals intact after changing the social relationship to the means of production. The Cubans, in their 'Fifth National Congress on Education and Culture had stated:\" It was resolved that all manifestations o!f homosexual devi an cy are to be firmly rejected and prevented from spreading... iit was agreed to demand that severe penalties are applied to those Who corrupt the morals of minors, depraved and repeated offenders are irredeemable antisocial elements\". Tatchell was barred from speaking at seminars but eventually was allowed to address a section of the audience.\" But as soon as1 mentioned Gay Liberation\", he s a lid,\" all the language translations abruptly stopped and a' technical fault' developed. There were subtle attempts to dissuade me from continuing. The equipment was mysteriously 'ire-paired' but if or some equally mysterious reason! none of the remainder of my speech could be translated into' German \u2014\nalthough the majority of the audience were members of the Bast German CP youth movement, the F DJ\". Further trouble occurred when in common with other' liberation groups' he was handing out leaflets on the fifth\nday, and some members of the F DJ tried to physically run him out of the festival precincts after a senior East German official had burnt one of the leaflets. A group of sympathisers intervened and demanded his release. But the emptiness o!f the phrases uttered at the start by Honecker was to be still further proven, during the march t \u00bb\nthe final rally. Tatchell had prepared a placard which read( in German!\" Homosexual Liberation \u2014 ' Revolutionary homosexuals SU0\"\nport socialism\", and on the other side,\" Gay Liberation Front, London. Civil Wights for Homosexuals\". He was told however that the placard was\" offensive te the G DIR\", but after explaining that i the text was in accent\nwith the GDR constitution which guarantees civil right st \u00bb .\nhomosexuals, he was grabbed by members of the F DJ ant\nStalinist s of the British contingent as he tried to leave \u00ab\nrestaurant.\" They tried to drag me into aside room\", he said. \"Tbm\nrestaurant doors were locked and a line ofF DJ heavies stood shoulder to shoulder across the doorway to prevent me from leaving\". He was rescued by some of b is supporters from the British delegation. Once outside he was be sei ged by an angry mob of British delegates who said that he couldn't march with them carr ying that placard. It appeared later that had he gone with ith\u00bb\ndelegation carrying the placard the PD J would have physically tried to prevent the Whole delegation leaving. Scuffles occurred when Tatchell refused to leave be hint f his placard. To settle this dispute a vote was called for\nand during the discussion a rumour was circulated amongst the delegates that Tatchell' s placard said,\" G'DR persecutes homosexual's\". The vote indicated toy as light majority that Tatc'hell Should mot be allowed to carry his placard. Tat che H said he would 'ignore the vote, denouncing it was unconstitutional and undemocratic that a Gay Lib placard be not\ncarried, as all other groups within the delegation had th a right to carry one. At this, violence flared and Tatchell continued:\" People were punched, kicked, clothes were ripped, etc., and threats made upon my life. Those involved in speaking and voting against me Carrying the placard, and in the ensuing violence included members of the Communist Party, Y C Land th* NUS \u2014 the latter two organisations having official policy statements in support of gay liberation!\". Eventually, Tatchell was escorted to the flat of some ga if friends in Berlin as\" the Violence was so frightening that\nsome people 'feared i for my safety\". According to the' Stalinist s that is\" friendly candid discussion\" as Honecker said. Following their meanings on* expects them to describe the events lin Hungary1956 and Czechoslovakia1968 perhaps as\" heated debate\".

    "content": "October 9th,1973 FELIX Page 7\nEDITORIAL What an earth-shattering introduction for\nfresher s the last U GM was. Here we are back at IC after one of the most momentous\nsummer vacations for ages: where a fascist\ndictatorship has been installed in Chile after\na bloody military coup, black South Africans\nmown down at Western Deeps, a gold mine\nwith sub machine guns, price rises in this\ncountry of a scale reminiscent of Weimar type inflation, bombs exploded by mysterious\nbombers all round the country and industrial\naction on the cards this winter, of the sort\nthat codd topple governments.\nBut what do we find at the U GM? Just\nICU pledging itself again to follow the line\nof the NUS with regard to the grants campaign. What have we won out of last year's mass\nmobil is ation of500,000 students at its peak\naround the4 basic NUS demands? \u2014 A10% grant CUT due to rising prices and no\nadvance on the demands.\nNo surprise is it that the Stalinists here\nat IC feel that students will be difficult to\nmobil is e this term, after a'l that resulted in\nnothing.\nThey' re talking of course of mobil is ation around their leadership \u2014 that politically\nbankrupt farce of Steve Parry, Judy Cotter,\nStuart Paul and their fellow travellers like\nNUS President John Randall.\nThe same kind of leadership as shown by Oigby Jacks, last year's NUS President, who\nwas reduced to silence at King's, last Thur s day, when challenged over the questions of\nChile and the role of the Popular Front.\nThe problems that students face today are\nnot isolated from the rest of society. They pay the same rising prices, live in the same\n(if not worse) accommodation at ex h orbi tant rents and have the same future of111 per cent mortgages, closure of industry and Weimar inflation as everyone else.\nSingle-issue protest politics is dead in this\nsituation. To try to force the Tories to\naccede to our really minimal demands by a campaign leading up to a session at the bargaining table is nothing short of blatant\ntreachery. On all other fronts the Tories\nhave burnt the bargaining tables and where\nthey stood, placed an armed policeman from\nthe Special Patrol Group.\nThe working class isn't going to sit back\nand have its Democratic rights and living\nstandards smashed by the Tories, in an effort to save their vanishing profits in this\nperiod of rapidly deepening worldwide economic crisis.\nThat is only if the fight is taken up within\nthe trade unions to remove their leadership\nof labour lefts, right wingers and Stalinists.\nThey preach that the way to fight against\nthese attacks by the Tories is a Popular\nFront pledged to socialism by reform.\n\" The peaceful road to socialism\", they\ncall it. But what we learnt from Chile is\nthat the so called peaceful road to socialism is the bloody road to fascism. These English Allende s are not misguided\nindividuals, they are consciously working\nagainst the interests of the working class in\norder to retain their privileged positions in\ntheir respective beau roc rac ies. Not that Allende had a suicide wish, it's just that his whole role and position came from his political standpoint, which was the peaceful road of the Stalinists.\nThe present leaders of the grants campaign at NUS are of the same political kind\nand are leading us up the same garden\npath to betrayal.\nSo what do we do? Leave our future in the hands of these charlatans and class\ncollaborators or build a principled trader-ship within NUS that will fight for our rights\nand living standards.\nReview of a year to come\nAAAAAA AA\"AAAA AAA^ \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u00bb * \u00bb * * \u00bb # A' \u00bb \u00bb . * \u00bb A \u00bb A A* AM*\n* X \u2022\nM** \u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n, \u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\nFUTURE ENTS\nHOPS/CONCERTS\nTIME 8p.m.( Prices later)\nFriday 12 Oct. \u2014 BEES MAKE HONEY.

Some of the Author's original illustrations are included with the calendar and this may attract many fans, as the drawings themselves are pleasant enough pieces, and you can always stick them on your wall. The drawings reflect the books, and vary from trite\nwoodland scenes through heroic fantasy to bedtime storybook illustrations. They are all charming but have absolutely nothing to say. Pretty pretty art for\narts sake. If you area true Tolkien fan this is probably just what you wanted, but you maybe disappointed in the comparison between what the author drew and your mental impression of the scenery. This may not be the\nplace to attempt to review the books themselves other than to.\nsay that they are escap ist fantasies written during WorldWar Two and really represent the\nhopelessness of all\nliberal intellectuals posed with the huge struggles of society outs ide their comprehension or influence. Whose\nresponsibility?\nAs a graduate who has been trained for probation work, they could\nbe yours. You have learned to think straight, to distinguish cause\nfrom effect. That ability and a practical approach to problems, are\nnow more important in our work than ever. For the Probation and\nAfter-Care Service is a principal agent in the Government's aim to extend the range of workable alternatives to prison. Some form of\ncommunity service, day training centres and intensive\nsupervision\u2014such are the kinds of alternative treatment that\nthe Home Office is sponsoring. And Probation Officers are\ngoing to carry them out. That is why anyone coming into the\nservice at this time must be flexible in approach; eager to\napply new techniques; and willing to experiment.\nThe way you enter is normally through a course of professional training\nrecognised by the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work and leading to the Council's Certificate of Qualifications in Social Work. Courses last between one and two years, depending on your degree.\nDuring training a salary of at least \u00a31,416 is paid. After training, a Probation\nOfficer's salary starts at \u00a31,803 and rises in all cases to not less than \u00a32,232.\nOfficers have the opportunity to reach a higher maximum of \u00a32,661.\nPromotion to Senior Probation Officer would bring it up to \u00a33,216; further\npromotion could bring up to \u00a36,000 according to the probation area. (Increases\nin these scales are currently being negotiated). All Officers working in the\nLondon area receive additional remuneration.\nFor more information about this demanding and fulfilling career, please send\nyour name and address on a postcard to The Home Office, Probation and\nAfter-Care Department ( ), Room 446, Marsham Street, London,\nSWI P3 DY, or get in touch with your local Principal Probation Officer whose\naddress and telephone number are in the telephone book.\nProbation& AfterCare Service "

NAIL-BITING\nTHRILLER\" GRIPPING DAILY EXPRESS I WES DION1 A II D COSTA O AVn AS'._ STATE OF n SUNDAY TELEGRAPH Muacty;\nWlKlSTHEOCTRAKIS\nNOW SHOWING CURZON ST MAYFAIR W1499373738 J LOWJON'S LUXURVCWEMA FULLY AIR-CONDITIONED\nCURZON\nLetter to the Editor\nS ir,On behalf of the\nRoyal School of\nMines Union, may I compliment you on\nhaving the first 'Felix'\nof the term (Issue No.340), delivered on\ntime to the Imperial\nCollege Union Office,\nand no further. This\nalone represents a tremendous amount of\nwork on your part.\nfilm Review This firm was direct-ed by Costa-Gavras, one\nof the few directors who make strongly political\nfilms. The scene was set in a South American country, which remain-ed anonymous throughout and claimed to relate a true story. It was about an episode in the fife of the T up amaro s guerrillas or\" unmentionables\" as they are called as their name is banned. In a very smooth\noperation they kidnap the Brazilian Consul, an American Embassy attac he and another American called Philip\nMichael Santere. In bul-let in s, which they regularly broadcast, they\ndemand that political\nprisoners, held by the government, should be released in exchange for the kidnap victims.\nThe government, of\ncourse, denies that it\nhas any political prison-ers, only common cri-min als, and refuses to\nnegotiate. Instead, it\norders a thorough search for the missing men and at one time\nthey come very close to\nbeing found but for the incompetence of the police. In the meantime the guerrillas interrogate\ntheir captives. The reason for the kidnapping of Santere is a mystery\nto the press as officially\nhe is a member of\nA.I.D.( Agency for International ije ve i op ment) advising on traffic and communications. It soon becomes apparent that\nhe is nothing of the sort\nbut is really there to\nwork closely with the army and secret police.\nThe guerrillas claim that\nthe government is corrupt and in establishing its ends uses torture dev ices( some rather\nhorrific scenes are shown) and completely disregards the law and constitution. They say that Sante re aided them and other Latin American countries to establish right wing views.\nHe turns out to be a complete oppressor of\nany form of liberalism and communism. The tension in the film increases as the government refuses to\nyield to the terrorists'\ndemands and it even\nconsiders resigning. On the whole the film exp res ses the situation in South America very\nwell. It was shot, with\nmuch opposition, in\nChile but the makers strongly deny that the events in it have anything to do with Chile. Even so it is worth noting that in1970 a former American police chief, Mr. Dan Mitrioni,\nwas kidnapped, with\ntwo others, and, later\nkilled in Chile. The film\nportrays the situation\nfrom the guerrillas'\npoint of view and does\nso very well. They say that they are fighting for\nliberalism and demo-c racy and are shown to\nbe compassionate, well-organised people who genuinely regret to have\nto go to such extremes to make themselves heard. Excellent direction makes this very\nclear and it is a film\nwell worth seeing.\nMark Gill.\nYves Montand arrives at Police headquarters in 'State of Siege' All eight pages\nhave been filled, We find the two page\narticle on 'Felix goes\nto press' most in-te resting, and the two-page Diary, with its\nlarge daily squares,\nmost useful. Spoil is\nmentioned; but the\nstandard articles by\nthe Union Officers\nstill leave some column-inches to be\nfilled.\nWhat superhuman\nefforts you must have\nexpended in collecting articles on such\nfar-flung topics, and\nwith such wide\nappeal.\nUnfortunately your\nheavy workload has\nobviously been responsible for the\ngross libel that you\nhave printed on Page\n2 of this issue. I refer,\nof course, to the\narticle neatly crammed into the top\nof columns 3-6; and\nmore specifically to\nthe 3rd paragraph of\n'Imperial College Publications'.\nThe Royal School\nof Mines Union objects most strongly to\nthe following lies, as\nprinted and circulated in Felix under\nyour auspices as\neditor.\n1. That Minesletter is 'defunct'.\n2. That the members of our Union\ndoing research are\nboth 'geriatric', and\nfew in number.\n3. That some members of our Linion\nare doing deferred\nhonours.\n4. That 'rumour'\nhas it that Minesletter\nis more blue in content and politics than\nGuildsheet.\nTo substantiate our\nobjections we would\nlike to bring to your\nnotice the following\npoints.\n1. Minesletter has\nbeen published frequently. The most recent dates being,\n24.5.73, 1.10.73. Last\nyear a total of eight\neditions were pub-li shed.2. Applications for\nresearch posts are\nmost carefully con-side red, and in common with any institution that is proud of\nits name and re put a tion, only postgraduates of the highest calibre are ad-mitte d. By no means\ncan 223 postgraduates be considered\nfew in number.\n3. There are no\nmembers of our\nUnion taking deferred honours in this\nacademic year.\n\u2022 4. The publication\nof any rumour is bad\nethics, and concealing\nthe source of a rumour is a most despicable practice.\nOn behalf of the\nRoyal School of\nMines Union, I would\nask you to publish\nthis letter 'in toto' in\nthe next edition of\nFelix. This action on\nyour behalf would be\nconsidered a formal\napology and the matter dropped.\nPAUL GEE Editor's reply:- jI welcome your letter and print it not as a formal apology but in\norder to reply to the\npoints raised.\nI shall not attempt to\nanswer you point by point but I should like\nto point out that the\nmajority of my 'work-load' as you put it is\nunfortunately not at present spent collecting articles but rather hunt-ing, begging and cajoling adverts without\nwhich Felix wouldn't even exist.\nFair enough, you might say, but what is\nthe point of producing a paper which is financially viable but irrelevant to students. Right,\nand so doing the\ngroundwork that Iam at present on advertising should enable me to\nspend less time on the telephone and more\ntime researching art i cles. Nonetheless I appeal to all students\nto write for Felix a sIam sure that the last\nthing that is wanted is\nan issue written by me. To move on to the' gross libels'. I apologise for stating that\nMinesletter is defunct in\nthe sense of no longer\nbeing published- The references implying that\nonly long-standing members of the College could remember the\nlast issue of Minesletter is, as you have\npointed out factually in-correct. It was by no\nmeans meant to refer\nsolely to people in the\nR. S.M.U. but to students\nin general.\nThe sources of the 'rumour' were many\nconversations with students and as such appeared to be the feeling of a section of the\nstudent body. Rather\nthan state it as such I called it, perhaps with\na degree of semantic lassitude, a 'rumour'.\nI note that you take\nno exception to the\ncontent of the statement\nabout the subject of\nMinesletter but instead\nfocus your criticism onto the form of that\nstatement.\nI conclude that you regard the statement is\ncorrect and I hope that\nyou will remedy the\nsituation.\nFELIX, Newspaper of Imperial College Union.

That the content of HE embodies\nthe values of the ruling\nclass.\n2. That the individuality of study\nepi tomis ed in the competitiveness\nof the exam system further reinforces the divisions between\nclasses.\n3. The struggles which have taken\nplace around the issues of educational policy, e.g.( a) the dismissal of a left wing lecturer at Lancaster.\n(b) the s it in s at Cambridge.\n(c) the alternative seminars at\nSussex.\n(d) the alter anti ve prospectus\nat Thames Polytechnic.\nRACIALISM\n1 Conference notes the increasing\ndiscrimination against Black\npeople in 'Britain through direct\neconomic and social deprivation\ne.g. housing, educational opportunity; constant police harass-ment; legislation aimed at keep\ning out black and brown im mi grants; the recent Court of Appeal\ndecision to apply the immigration\nact retrospectively.\n2. Conference believes that racial-ism is a product of the imperialist\nsystem and serves its interests.\nThe imperialist powers seek to\nuse workers from the newly independent states of Africa and Asia, employed often in the hardest\nand worst paid jobs. Further,\nracial is m is a tactic to divide the\nworking class by providing a scapegoat for diverting the frustration and anger of people from\nthe capitalist system, on to an\nunder-privileged and easily identifiable section of the community.\nSuch a tactic flourishes in an atmosphere of unemployment.\n3. Conference rejects the concept\nThat the problem of racial is m can be solved by cultural assimilation\nof the black community. This\n\" melting pot philosophy\" tacitly\nplaces black culture in an inferior\nposition.\nConference condemns Conservative and Labour Governments for\npropagating such racist attitudes\nto appease racist groups.\n4. Conference, however, notes the\ndisturbing increases in racist at-ti tudes, from which no group in\nsociety is entirely free. Conference notes that the activity of\nfascist organisations notably the\nNational Front, has increased recently appealing with racist propaganda and inciting violence\nagainst black people.\n5. Conference believes that students\nwith other progressive forces, in\nparticular the trade union move-ment, have a major responsibility\nin stepping up the fight against\nracial is m and racial disc rim in a tion, and the development of\nfascist organisations.\n6. Conference notes the firm stand\ntaken in the past by NUS and Student Unions against racial is m, especially the activity against the\nincrease in students' fees in\n1967, and the resolution on im migration passed at Easter conference 1 9 7 1 .\n7 Conference condemns the racialist bias of the education system\nin this country, and the lack of\nspecial facilities for immigrants\nwhich increasingly is a problem\nfor black school children, who, rejected by a highly selective\nsystem of education are unjustly\noften relegated to ESN establish-ment s. Conference believes that\nthis is a problem which particularly deserves the attention of\nstudent teachers.\n8. Conference welcomes the development of organisations among\nblack and brown people to counter increased discrimination and harassment. Conference believes\nthat the NUS students should\nwork with such groups, for the\nurgent need is to build the unity\nof all anti-racialist forces, black\nand white.\n9. Conference believes that much\nmore work must be done to\nchallenge the ideas of racial is m and that criticism of the mass\nmedia for its representation of\nracial questions should be under-taken. Criticism of the education\nsystem for a failure to reflect the\nhistory culture and achievements\nof people from the third world,\nand to provide the facilities necessary and the training to eq i up teachers and social workers to\ndeal with the special problems of\nimmigrant children, is essential.\nINSTRUCTIONS NUS Exec.\nTo organise the fullest co-opera-tion with organisations committed\nto fighting racial is m,e.g. J.C. W.I. Liberation, Institute of Race Relations, Anti-Apartheid, I.W.A. Organisations.\nC.O.'s To affiliate to the above organisations where possible.\nC.O.'s and Areas\nTo participate in the establishment\nof local anti-fascist committees\nwherever possible. Where these do\nnot exist to approach Trades Councils, trade union branches and other organisations to consider the\npossibility of establishing such a committee involving the organised\nmovement and immigrant organisations. NUS Exec.\nTo continue opposition to higher\nfees for overseas students.\nNUS Exec. & ' C.O.'s To fight all academic links with\nSouth Africa and Rhodesia and to\npublicise those links which do\nexist.\nNUS Exec.\nTo campaign for training for\nteachers and social workers to\nequip them to deal with problems\nof immigrants.\nNUS Exec. & C.O.'s To campaign for the introduction\nof courses to teach the history,\nculture and achievements of third\nworld peoples.\nNUS& C.O.'s To campaign for facilities to help\nimmigrant graduates become\nqualified to enter the British education system; particularly, in the\nteaching profession, with j pec i al facilities for late entrants.\nNUS& CO.'s To campaign for the repeal of the\nretrospective clause of the Immigration Act and eventually its re\npeal as a whole.\nNUS Exec.\nTo consider setting up special\nmachinery to deal with the problems of immigrant students.\nNUS Exec. & C.O.'s To support scholarships for victims of racial is m overseas.\nCOMMUNITY\nAND ENVIRONMENT\nConference notes that as long as to-day's problems are continually stated\nin terms of mass politics and mass\norganisation it is clear that only i nternational and national institutions\ncan deal with them. Yet, these very\ninstitutions are often tending to exaggerate the capitalist and industrial\ndrive towards \u2014\n1. centralisation of power and consequent limiting of scope for\nlocal initiatives\n2. subjugation of the interests of\nmankind as a whole to the interests of a powerful few\nConference thus asserts that, if an\necologically sound relationship of\nrespect between people and their environment is to be realised, then\nthose without power must be able to\nchallenge those selective institutions\n(such as the education system)\nwhich perpetuate the right of the\npowerful few to maintain the present\ncycle of exploitation.\nAlthough national and local student\nunions TALK about solidarity with\nthe powerless to achieve these ends.\nSCA and eco-action groups ACT together with rang and file trade union-is ts, residents, claimants and children in local situations actually challenging these power relationships.\nSuch work includes \u2014\n(i) urban renewal as a priority \u2014\nvia action on transport, hous\ning, urban trails, tenants ac\ntion, etc.\n(ii) the consolidation of the shift\nwithin schools towards environmental and community\naction.\n(iii) campaigning for more decentralisation of power and more\nautonomy.\n(iv) challenging the vertical hierarchies of the professional\noften based on strict curriculum special is ation.( v) boycotts and education campaigns by action groups in\nsupport of the interests of the\nThird World. Two projects were established u nder the auspices of NUS in 1971 for a trial period of three years to wot k with local community( S CAN US) and eco-action ( CONCERN US) groups. Both projects produce regular newsletters filled with contributions from activists round the country,\nact as an information exchange, organise conferences and workshops,\nproduce various publications, and S CAN US is involved in researching\nthe developments of alternatives in\nhigher education.\nEach project has two workers who operate as a team; they are in direct\ncontact with local groups which enables them to be responsive to the\nneeds of local activists. S CAN US has\nworked closely with an advisory\ngroup of student activists who play\na major part in the running of the\nproject within the broad policy lines\nlaid down by NUS national confer-en ce. Conference res co gnis es that \u2014\n(i) to facilitate local activity it is\nessential that this system of communication continues to\nexist in order to spread information arid aid groups' inter-action.\n(ii) the three year S CAN US and CONCERN US projects are due\nto close in the summer of 1 9 7 4 .\n(iii) experience via newsletters, field\nvisiting, workshops and research\nhave demonstrated the need and effectiveness of flexible grassroots controlled projects.\nConference notes the large numbers of students involved in these activities and recognises the need to\ncontinue to encourage and support\ntheir development.\nConference, acknowledging the\ninter-related elements of the 'cycle\nof exploitation' outlined above, therefore advocates the setting up of a national Joint Environment and Community Project to help coordinate\nwork in these areas.\nThe following points are necessary\nelements in the Joint Environment\nand Community Project:\n(i) in establishing this joint project the NUS should be aware\nthat they are not organising a national campaigning unit or\ninitiating specific projects but\nthat each Union situation is\nunique; in terms of action within the community and on environmental issues only students within that Union can\ndecide what form is suitable.\n(ii) NUS Conference should retain\noverall control with an Advisory Group (see iii) being responsible for day to day affairs.\n(iii) the Advisory Group be elected\nby an Annual Conference of\nactivists. NUS Executive members with responsibilities for\nthe Joint Project will be full\nmembers of the Advisory\nGroup.\n(iv) the Joint Project will not have\ndepartmental status within\nNUS since this implies managerial control, which would reduce responsiveness, flexibility and communications with\nthe grass-roots and would inhibit the capacity of staff to react to local needs via field\nvisits, etc.\n(v) at least four full-time staff are\nrequired working on an equal\nbasis with equal pay and their\nappointment and dismissal\nshall be the responsibility of\nthe Advisory Group.\n(vi) the nature of the work will be\nthe maintenance of a com muni cations system between groups\nas outlined earlier based on\nvisits, workshops, newsletter\nand should remain responsive\nto the changing needs of\ngroups.\n(vii) some differences will exist in the emphasis of future work \u2014\nsuch as the information base\nand scale of issues \u2014 and this\nwill require that the staff of\nthe Joint Project retain some\nseparate functions.\nEUROPEAN\nPEACE AND\nSECURITY\nNUS Conference notes that the\nmajor trend in European affairs is\nthat of detente. Conference specifically notes the treaties signed between the Soviet Union and the\nFederal Republic of Germany, Poland,\nand the FRG and the German Democratic Republic and the FRG; The\n1971 four power agreement on Berlin; the 1 9 7 3 bilateral agreement between the USA and the USSR; the\ngrowing international recognition of\nthe GDR; the partial success of the\nHelsinki SALT talks and the recently\nheld talks marking the opening stages\nof the European Security Conference.\nConference further notes the increased possibilities of international\ncontacts arising from the successful\nparticipation of over 4 0 0 delegates\nin the 10th World Festival of Youth,\nand the united opposition of important Scottish local authorities, labour\nmovement and students to the presence of nuclear bases in the West of\nScotland, expressed in the 1973 CNf>\nEaster march.\nConference welcomes the growing\ndemand that Britain should leave the\nEEC and that a future Labour Government should implement this.\nIn the meantime, in the interests of its membership the NUS Conference\ninstructs the Executive to collaborate\nfully with other student unions of\nWest Europe, the International Union of Students and relevant organisations of the labour movement in order\njointly to protect student interests in\nrespect of educational reforms and the transfer ability of professional\nqualifications; and to report to\nEaster Conference 1974 on the same.\nAs a first year student in the\nMathematics Department last\nyear I took an active part in the organisation of social events for my year and was elected Social Rep. Consequently I still hold a strong belief that the social life of the\ndepartment is sadly lacking and am always looking to\nthose in posts of responsibility\nto improve it.\nYou may imagine how outraged I was to hear that by Sunday, 7th October1973 there are only six students,\nincluding Freshers, attending\nthe Fresher s' Dinner. Unfortunately the numbers have to\nbe in to Mr. Mooney by Tuesday. It is the job of the Department Rep. to persuade students to come along to the\nDinner and as we have reached this sorry state of affairs,\none must ask whether the\npresent Department Rep. is\nreally interested in the social\nlife of our department or did he just stand for a seat on Council for Soc. Soc.I await\nhis reply with anticipation.\nHaving attacked my Department Rep. in this fashion Iam bound to be asked why I did not stand for election. The\nanswer to this is quite simple,\nI feel that I can help students\nenjoy college life more as Ents. Chairman of R CSU than\nI could have as Maths. Department Rep. The readers of Felix who feel concerned on reading this\nletter that a vast majority of\nFreshers will miss out on the\nbiggest social event of their\nyear can rest assured that\nsomething will be done. Al though there is only one day left to persuade Freshers to\ncome along, a group of us who feel outraged by the results of\nour Department Reps, work\nwill do all in our power to per-sua de people to come along.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter R. Teague,\nMaths. II.\n\n"

    "content": "9th October, 1973\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFREE! ISSUE No. 341\nICU GM: NO POLICY TO FIGHT REFECTORY PRICE INCREASES The quorum at last Thursday'sU GM was successfully challenged before discussion could take\nplace on the refectories motion.\nThe motion, proposed by\nPaul Watkins, suggested\ncourses of action to be taken\nagainst the 5 per cent increase that has been operating in all refectories since\nthe beginning of term.\nTop of his list of proposals was one to not pay the\nincrease but only pay for\nmeals according to last\nyear's list. A petition would\nhave been organised and presented to the Governing\nBody by a mass demon stra tion.\nIt was announced by the\nSecretary Paul Wadsworth that Mike Simm on ds, who\nwas elected to the newly\ncreated post of chairman of\nSCAB, will not now be re-signing.\nElections were held for\ndelegates to the forthcoming\nNUS conference in No vem ber. Each candidate spoke\nfor one minute and a secret\nballot was held. After eight\nreallocations the successful\ncandidates with votes achieved (according to the STV system) were\nN. Sayles 88\nT. PhilMps 4 6\nD. Sinclair 41\nJ. Lane 3 6\nJ. Porter 3 4 . 4 5\nMiss P. Moult31.17 A. Campbell25.55 J. East 2 3 . 2 4\nA motion on grants was\nproposed by John Lane calling for support for the NUS grants campaign. An amend ment was proposed by Steve\nMilton calling for immediate\ncash supplementary grants to\nbe paid to cover inflation.\nThis was defeated overwhelmingly and the motion\npassed as it stood apart\nfrom a minor semantic amendment. Purple Patch\nAt the Union meeting last week, this Union voted in favour of arent strike next term. I have heard it said that the motion covered up the fao t that arent strike was the most salient point, but nevertheless we have got\none now, and it is our job to make the strike the most comprehensive action that the Union has taken on the behalf of the Grant's campaign. Many of you will laugh at the idea of arent strike both from the point of view that the rents in our eo lle eg are the che a pest in London and also from the point of\nview that this type of action has absolutely no effect ' other than getting the college's backup against the students. The real reason for the rent strike is as a means of using the college to show the government that we are not in favour of 'the grants situation as it stands at the present. We must make it clear that although a person in hall is capable of surviving throughout the year on the grant Which he or she gets,\nthe person lout of hall who is having to\npay anything in the region of \u00a35 to \u00a310 for his digs, is not getting anything like a fair deal. We must also Show that the anomalies of the Postgraduate grant( \u00a315 per week), and the discrimination shown against mar ried women in Higher education is totally unjust, and drastic improvements to the methods of assessment should be made. Although Imperial college has so far participated in nothing on the scale of arent strike this lis no reason for us not to do so now. In fact this is the to est time of all for us to act upon our views. Our college is regarded( and quite correctly) as an institution of\" Academic Students\"( think about it!!!) and are respected as such in the circles of power that toe. As such an institution, any action which we are likely to take will have the greatest effect upon those people whom it concerns. Sir Brian Flowers, in his addresses to the freshmen last weeks aid:\"I must agree that your opportunities are being limited, I hope temporarily, by i the grants which you receive. No doubt, all of you believe that grants are too low, that they do not recognise the genuine financial\ndifficulties which Students have to meet, that they undervalue the contributions which students already make Ito society, and even more the contributions which they are preparing to make in the future.\" Without wishing to make at this time a quantitative statement, I would like you all to know that J share these beliefs and shall use what influence I have in your support.\" Surely mass action from the students in College accommodation will give the Rector just the push which he is looking for, so\nthat he can begin to get something done. This year will see the Government's triennial review of Students grants, and it is\nright that I.C. have saved their campaign until now, tout it is essential that this campaign is the campaign of the whole of the student body, or atleast has the support of\nthe whole of the student body, for it to be effective.\nI was elected into the post of President on a moderate platform, and a moderate student I still am, but we must realise that unless we backup the people who are working in our favour then we cannot exp ect anyone to take notice iof the m.I realise that some students in college feel it an atrocity that refectory prices have been increased by5 percent this year over what they were last year, but do they realise that these price increases are small compared with those which have been imposed on other colleges in the London area, some of which are in i the region of 15 or16 per cent. ( The increases include such places as L.S.E., probably one of the most politically active colleges in the London area.) Iam not advocating for a further increase in the refectory prices in our college, but what Iam saying is Ithat the college authorities have gone as far as the law permits them to go in keeping the price increases down to a minimum. I would say, that rather than refusing to pay the increase in the prices or whatever, we should ACCEPT the in creases, and use the fact that they have been made to strengthen our fight for a higher grant for all students.( Do you re a lise that Hall rents have now to een stationary for the past two years at a no und \u00a34 per week!!) I would ask you to support mein believing that the college authorities are working as far as they are allowed, on our Side, and what we need to do as not to protest TO them, but VIA them to the government. We need to work to get (the college as our ALLIES, and not to make them our ENEMIES. SUPPORT the rent strike next term, but only if you can see that it is a direct attack on the government, i.e. on the Grants system, and is NOT an attack on the college. Those of you in hall this year should rem ember that you have it easy now, hut next year many of you will be paying almost twice as much forfar worse accommodation outside college that you have alt the moment. Let us begin to work together WITH the college( NOT against them) for a better Standard of living for all students. Norm PARKING PLACES\nBelow is printed a list of successful applicants for parking places. The first half have been allocated residents\nplaces. These are situated at the rear of Linstead Hall. The remainder are commuters' places.\nAs usual, there were far more applications than places\navailable. AH the forms were considered by the Union Executive over the weekend and I would like to express\nmy gratitude for their assistance and especially the time\nthat they have donated to this.\nIt was generally felt that a main criteria for choosing\nthe places should be to use the places available to the\nfullest advantage i.e. to get as many people into college\nas it is possible using the places we have got. You will\nnotice that a number of applications have been specified\nas joint even if they were not originally submitted as\nsuch. It is a condition of allocation of the place that the\nsuccessful applicants agree to share their place such that\nonly one car is used in the place on any given day. ONLY ONE STICKER WILL BE ALLOCATED. This will have on\nit the registration number of the cars allowed to use the\nspace. Cars will not be able to park without a sticker.\nStickers will be allocated only at the following times.\nTuesday, 9th October, 2.30\u20143.30 (if stickers available).\nWednesday tOth, 12.30\u20141.30, Thursday11 th,11.30 \u201412.30.\nI will definitely be in the Union Office at these times. All allocation will be in the outer Union Office. Successful\nallocations will be in the outer Union Office. Successful\ncern ed. Stickers will not be issued unless I see the log\nbook.\nMotor cycles must be registered with the security office\nin College Block. This is for cases of emergency and the\nlike.\nA final word\u2014I will not fail to clamp down heavily on\nthose people breaking the parking regulations. It will be\nregarded as a discipline case if students are parking il leg ally. For your own benefit, obey the rules.\nP.A. Wadsworth,\nChairman, I.C.U.

The situation for medical students\nis even worse; the Survey\nestimates that they are \u00a32.40\na week below the level they\nshould be.\nThe Survey was presented\nto I he University of Bristol\nCouncil in July. As a result\nthe Council, which has a majority of laymen, including\ntop businessmen and local\nauthority representatives, asked Bristol's Vice-Chancellor,\nDr.A.W. Mcr r is ion, to write\nto the Department of E duc ation and Science expressing\nthe Council's concern about\nthe student grant situation\nhighlighted by the Survey's findings. The Bristol letter\nasked the DES to consider in particular the following\npoints:\nt. that the main grant\nshould be settled at a realistic level\n2. that there should be proper arrangements for\ncombating inflation\n3. that the parental contribution system should\nbe abolished\n4. that the principle of smaller grants for married women students\nwas wrong, and\n5. that special cases, such\nas medical and dental\nstudents, who work a48 week year, deserved\nspecial treatment.\nMr. Norman St. JohnStcvas, for the DES, has replied that he agrees with the\nCouncil that grants should be\nadequate to meet the essential costs of attendance at\nacademic courses. He refuses\nto make any promises about\narrangements to combat inflation. He estimated that the\nabolition of the parental contribution would cost \u00a34m per\nannum. He has undertaken to\nIC NUPE OUT\nON STRIKE\nOver the last few months\nwe have seen mounting attacks by police on working-class communities. The 'police, under the pretext of the bomb hysteria and anti-Irish demagogy, last week\nraided houses in Prince of Wales Crescent, Charrington\nStreet, Harwood Street, Basset Street, Gil den Road and Piatt Street. Two hundred and fifty police were involved\nin the raids, several were\narmed, some carried sledge-hammers, which they used\nto smash down doors and break windows.\nSEARCH FOR BOMBS Each of the streets was\n\"first cordoned off by police\ncoaches so no one could get\n!\nih or out. The police entered\n:\nthe houses whether locked\nor otherwise, smashing down\nfloors, climbing through\nwindows and over rooftops.\nMen and women were forced\nfrom their beds, interrogated\nwhile dressing and watched\nwhile their possessions were\nthrown around the room as\npolice searched for explosives. However no arms or\nbomb factories were un-earthed. Nevertheless 3 0\npeople were arrested on Friday morning on various petty\ncharges. None were charged\nin connection with the bomb-in gs. LAW OFF SIDE'\nOver the last week or two\nthere has been a series of in desc rim in ate raids on various squatting communities\nby the police. The House of\nLords ruling making conspiracy to trespass a criminal\noffence makes it very clear\nthat neither the law nor the\npolice are on the side of\nsquatters.\nFAIR RENT ACT This spells out grave danger for tenants \u2014 today\nsquatters are in the front\nline of attack in the broad\nhousing movement; tomorrow\nthe law and the police will\nbe used against the private\nand council tenant. Already\nthe 'fair rent act' is seen\nclearly to be opposed to tenants interests.\nPOLICE RAIDS\nThese police raids have\nbeen carried out in various\ncommunities and on one or\ntwo political organisations\n(i.e. Workers Fight headquarters \u2014 a radical left-wing group) over the last\ncouple of weeks, represent\nan increasing use of the\npolice to harass and terror-ise the community.\nPOLICE ATTACKS These attacks and h arras s ment of left-wing or a gnis at ions by the police signify\nthe 'bringing home' of the\nstruggle in Ireland. No longer\nwill the struggle be contained on the territory of the\noppressed but it is now being\ncarried back to the country\nof the oppressor. Under the\nsmoke screen of the bombings\nthe police and the state\nmachine are having their\npowers strengthened; already\nhaving chosen various \" hippy communities\" as the mass\nmedia put it to practise\nmanoeuvres before the full\nforce of the state machine is\nturned against the organised\nworking class. To send in\n2 5 0 police armed, carrying\nhatchets, walk ie talk ie, dogs,\nsetting up road blocks, cordoning off streets, isolating\nwhole areas under the pretext of looking for the bombers can only be seen in the\nlight of a military dress rehearsal by the state.\nPOLICE ESCORTS\nIn the last year the police\nhave been used more and more directly against workers interests. In particular\nthey have commonly escorted\nstrike breakers across picket\nlines in industrial disputes.\nThe law being used against\nthe Shrewsbury building\nworkers is being interpreted\nso that the tactic of the mass\npicket can be outlawed. The use of the immigration laws\nto increase divisions between\nblack and white workers, the\npay laws, the Industrial Relations Act all represent a strengthening of the state's legal armour y against working people.\nDEFEND LIBERTIES\nIt is becoming increasingly clear for the need to organise to defend what basic\nliberties we have.\nDIARY REMOVED\nJock Veall (one of your\nhippies (I) who had the\n'pleasure' of a bomb squad\ncalling last week and removing a diary of names and addresses 'for the records'(l) after failing to find explosives). Two weeks ago messengers, cleaners, maintenance, refectory, security and barmen all took industrial action. They came out on strike to support two fitters\nfrom maintenance who were suspended. The dispute arose because of the growing frustration of union members over the continual breaking of procedural agreements by college authorities. The procedure for the appointment of supervisors, once a vacancy appeared, was to advertise it both in and outside the college so that college employees as well as outsiders got a chance to apply for the job. For the second time in a few months college authorities broke this procedure and appointed' their man' without advertising the job. After several meetings the college management refused to\nbudge; faced with a choice of backing down or taking a stand, N. U.P. E. decided to\n\" block\" the supervisor, that\nis refused to take orders from him. College retaliated by suspending two of the fitters\nunder the supervisor. This in turn led to strike action by N. U.P. E. members to defend their suspended colleagues. Just over a day later\nmore than90% of N. U.P. E. members were out and the college was heavily blocked by other trade unionists. The postmen, dustmen and delivery men were all turned back at the college entrances by well manned picket lines. The effect of the picket was to make the strike bite right from the start. College had no post, delivery, cleaning, or security, and buildings were left unmanned. It was doubtful whether the college could remain open for long. There were undoubtedly some red faces amongst the college management, for on only the second day of the strike the authorities did an about face and backed down. They issued a public apology for breaking procedure and conceded to guarantee that\nfrom the non all vacant posts for supervisors would be advertised both in and outside college. The two fitters were reinstated, the college claiming to have made a mistake( for the second time) over the agreed procedure. Now that their collective strength has been demonstrated, N. U.P. E. officials\nhope that disagreements will betaken more seriously by college authorities. give special consideration to the problem of married\nwomen students living with non student husbands.\nTrevor Locke, Director of the Survey, and now President\nof the Bristol Students' Union said: \" We think our findings\nare important. The DES is in\nthe dark about the true situ-ation. Their statistics tend to\nbo two years out of date. This Survey is the most up-to-date\nand it covers an area which\nhas not been looked at before.\nWe wish to emphasise, for those looking for a national\nsignificance, that Bristol University has a higher percentage of students coming from\nwell-to-do backgrounds than\nmost. The situation at other\nuniversities is likely to be\nmuch worse than at Bristol.\nTherefore, the most significant results to come from our work will be those where financial disadvantage can be proved; if hardship exists\nhere one can be reasonably\nsure that it is far worse in many other universities.\" BACKGROUND \u2014\nINFORMATION The main conclusions and\nresults of the Survey arc:a) That the level of grants\nis just adequate for\nterm-time expenditure,\nbat does not allow for\nnecessary costs during\nvacations.\nb) That, as a result of this,\nusing conservative estimates of vacation expenditure( on food and\nretainers for term-time\naccommodation), the student is on average20% short, or \u00a357 p.a. OB hoard and lodging alone. c) That students on courses requiring more than30 weeks attendance at university are in an even more acute situation: especially medical stu dents undertaking clinical studies who are \u00a32.40\nper week short, compared with students on30 week courses. d) That students appear to be financing their short-fall for board and lodging from the money that\nought to be spent on books and equipment:\nan average expenditure\nem books of \u00a326 per year, compared with a'DES allocation of \u00a351\nwas reported.\ne) That the means test\nand parental contribution system is not working properly, since 2 0 %\nof students covered by the survey are not receiving the parental contribution that they should be, and are thus\ni in ding it even harder to\nmanage tina uci ally. Clinical medical students\nwork a48 week academic\nyear, and receive a grant of \u00a3596.20: this compares with \u00a3712 that would be received\nif the usual 30 week grant of \u00a3445 were extrapolated at the\nsame level. This means that\nthese students receive \u00a32.40\nper week less than students\nin other faculties throughout\ntheir working year. In addition to this, they have little\nopportunity to earn other\nincome, since they have only\nfour weeks vacation per year.\nThey also have to maintain\nstandards of appearance:\nanother expense from are \u00ab\nduce d grant.\nComments\nreceived\n\"Surely you should include\nquestions about the standard\nof living: it may seem thai\nthe cost of living is low for a lot of students because they\nhave to make do with what\nthey've got, than about quest ions on whether we have a room to ourselves or not; state of property, i.e. leaky\nroofs, etc.\"\" As a clinical medical student I have to be up for48 weeks per year. My total maintenance allowance is \u00a3596.20 per year, of which my parents contribute \u00a3528\nand my LEA \u00a368.20. I have no opportunity, obviously, to supplement this by a vacation job.\"\" Being female, items such as tights, deodorant, talcum powder, cosmetics, and\" personal hygiene\" easily costs\n\u00a31 per week. The amount: spent on food would be higher but I buy in bulk about \u00a315\nning of each term, e.g. m ashworth of goods at the be a med potato, coffee, sugar, soups, tins of stew, etc.\"\" I think that the student grant is becoming more and more impossible to manage on. BUT I think there are more people who arc less fortunate and less able to cope with money problems \u2014 esp e \u00ab\ndally the elderly. Therefore* I think students should campaign for people who have not the strength to fight for themselves.\" "

The\nidea was started in 1966 by IBlanton Belle, who got\nfed up with the misery and depression prevalent\namong students and composed of first and second year\nstudents and sixth former s decided to get them up.\nHis group has gone on from performing around\nMichigan to travelling all over the world. There are\nnow three performing groups. The audience are told\nabout the scheme during the performance and people\nwho are interested are interviewed later on. No basic\nskill is necessary to join, but interviewers look for\nmaturity, flexibility, concern for human kind, interest\nin people and ability to endure the tough life ahead.\nAfter one year the students are completely trans-formed. They manage to pack more adventure into\none week than many would in a year. They also learn\nto overcome difficulties and communicate with other\npeople. About two hundred out of the three hundred\ninvolved in the scheme are 'American.\nTwo professors travel with the group giving them\nthree to ten hours tuition a week in places ranging\nfrom hotel lobbies, ice skating rinks and squares to\ncathedrals and palaces. Great use is made of the\nchanging environment and history is taught literally\non the spot. Units offered are history, English and\nspeech with dance, music and physical education\navailable for the keen. 24 units can be picked up,\nas opposed to 32 on a university campus.

Hope its handy!\nThe case for effective family planning is\nirrefutable on hum-an it arian, economic\nand medical grounds.\nThe Family Planning\nAssociation has\nworked for almost 50\nyears for these principles and its 1,000\nclinics (ij hro ug j h out Great Britain dealt\nwith a record 805,642\nindividual patients in\n1972 as against464,356 five years ago.\nA major step in the\nFPA's progress this year\nwas the Government's long\nawaited decision to take\nover responsibility for its\nclinic and do mi ciliary ser-SCHOLAR\nSHIPS\nABROAD\nDetails of scholarships\noffered to British students by foreign governments and institutions\nare available from: Miss N.

These opportunities are\noffered mainly to present and\nprospective graduates and\nare available in countries\nranging alphabetically from\nAfghanistan to Yugoslavia,\nincluding the USSR, USA and Germany. Applications i must be in\nbetween November and\nMarch, depending on the\ncountry.\nvices by their gradual absorption into the National\nHealth Service from April\n1974. But the fact that\nthere are some 250,000\nunwanted pregnancies annually shows that the need\nfor advice and education\nremains enormous, which\nis why the FP A must continue in its endeavours to\nget the message across by\nevery possible means avail-able.\nThe FP A is responsible at\nthe moment for at least90 percent of the fal mily planning clinic services in this country. It believes that one of the main reasons for the continued rise in i the number of unwanted pregnancies is\nthe general misunderstanding about the costs involved to\nthe individual. How much greater the cost is to have a child which places an impossible burden on already over stretched purse strings, or the mental and/ or physical health of a woman can be\ngaugh ed from the following cost chart: Some284,207 new patients came to FP A clinics in1972, as against175,287 five years ago. Ten years ago the total number of all patients dealt with by the FP A was299,926 which included only94,037 newcomers. A very encouraging increase but still not enough when compared with the figures of unwanted pregnancies and known abortions, the latter being156,714 for1972. A wide range of FP A leaf-lets is available completely free of charge to anyone seeking help. Just under four million were distributed last\nyear, which was20 percent above the1971 figure. All that is necessary is a telephone call or a letter to FP A headquarters at2735 Mortimer Street, London W1A4 Q W(016367866). Personal callers are very welcome and the leaflets are displayed in the\nmain entrance and may be\nselected at random. Alternatively, they can be\nobtained from the local branches of the FP A and a tele-phone call to headquarters or a look at the GPO' s yellow pages will soon provide this information. The FP A fervently believes that every responsible inhabitant in the world should be\nconcerned with family planning. It has a member h sip scheme so that responsible people can keep abreast of\nthe latest developments and trends through the medium of its quarterly journal. Membership costs only \u00a31.25 a year. Very little when it is remembered that 'the Association is a charity and has worked for nearly50 years to Improve the quality of life of each family unit in Great Britain.
