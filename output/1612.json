Some hours later\nwe had arrived at our destination:\nthe beautiful Castell Courtyard\nin North Wales. Situated on a\npicturesque hillside (well, mountain,\ntechnically) this huge holiday home\nhad every comfort we could possibly\nneed \u2013 including a ten person hot\ntub \u2013 and this was a welcome\naddition considering the gruelling\nweek\u2019s training coming up! On\narrival most got straight to it with a\nrun. A hearty dinner set the tone for\nthe rest of the week, with big meals\nneeded to supply big appetites!\nAlumnus Jack, arriving late, decided\nto get in on the running action\ndespite it being dark, and only ran\ninto one fence.\nThe next day Jack and Ellie drove\nover to Snowdonia to do some\ntraining for an upcoming two day\nmountain marathon. Fellow runners\nLily and Lucie also joined them,\nrunning up Snowdon and back\nwith enough time to watch the end\nof the British Mountain Running\nChampionships.Back at the house a\nmorning run was followed by a core\nsession and then a brutal hill sprint\nin the afternoon.Club captain Liam\nCross Country take on Welsh hills\nSmith organised music to encourage\neveryone to push up the hills. A big\nroast dinner was a welcome treat\nand the last night of some departing\nclub members was cause for some\n\u2018minor\u2019 celebrations.\nThe hardier among us were up\nLily Battershill, Liam Smith and\nWill Jones\nCross Country\nAlex\nsubjected us\nto a brutal\ncore workout\nthat began\nwith an \u201ceasy\nwarm up\u201d of\na four minute\nplank.\nearly on Sunday morning for the\ntraditional long run. Jack, Ellie and\nWill ran up the highest mountain in\nthe area \u2013 Berwyn \u2013 which turned\nout to be quite an epic as it required\nclimbing another mountain just\nto get to it! Chris Bannon and\nChris Thomas also went mountain\nrunning and had a surprise meet up\nwith Jack and Ellie on the way back.\nOthers went in search of flatter\nrunning ground and found Lake\nVyrnwy; a lovely 18km loop that\nwe would return to for more runs\nlater in the week. Back at the house\nSocial Secretary Anna Lawson led a\ntough circuits session to prepare us\nfor the arrival of our strength and\nconditioning master Rob the next\nday. A chilled evening was spent\npreparing for Anna\u2019s birthday the\nnext day.\nThe next morning we all drove\nback over to Lake Vyrnwy. Some\nof us ran a full lap with the three\nChrisses laying down the pace\nand others getting a lift half way.\nWomen\u2019s captain Sarah came along\non her bike to provide some passing\nmotivation as she smashed a couple\nof laps. We rejoined at the end to\nhave a nice picnic in the sun by the\nlake shore before heading back.\nAfter a group stretching session led\nby club veteran Alwyn, Rob made\nsure we hadn\u2019t been slacking on the\ncircuits which suitably knackered\nanyone who wasn\u2019t already too\ntired to move. Surprise birthday\nbrownie cake was as good a cure as\nany and kicked off a fun night of\ncelebrations.\nTuesday morning was a more\nrelaxed affair with the big focus\nof the day being an afternoon trip\nto the Queensway Stadium in\nWrexham for a track session, which\nhandily coincided with an urgent\nrequest for the minibus to get an\nMOT.\nThe club split into two groups \u2013\none doing a long distance session\nof kilometre reps and the other\ndoing a middle distance session\nconsisting of 300m sprints with\nreducing rest between each one.\nStrong winds couldn\u2019t get in the\nway of some seriously fast running\nand encouragement from Liam and\nTom resulted in everyone leaving it\nall out on the track. \u2018GB Boy\u2019 Chris\nOlley ran so many laps that the rest\nof us started getting dizzy! Minibus\nreturned, we headed back for the\nhouse for a chilled out evening.\nWith the end of the week nearly\nin sight, Wednesday morning\nstarted with some more relaxed\nruns. Ophelie, Lily and Lucie\ntook the chance to explore some\npicturesque waterfalls nearby. Rob,\nstill not satisfied, put on another\ncircuits session before secretary\nAlex subjected us to a brutal core\nworkout that began with an \u201ceasy\nwarm up\u201d of a four minute plank.\nDinner was baked potatoes with\njust about every imaginable filling as\nwe tried to use up all our remaining\nfood.\nThe final day meant it was time\nfor a race! We returned to Lake\nVyrnwy one last time for seven\nkilometre handicapped time trial\nwith start times determined from\nfive kilometre personal bests \u2013 the\nintention being that if everything\nwent right we\u2019d all finish at the same\ntime. This made for an exciting\nfinish and with everything coming\ndown to the last kick, experienced\nclub member Duncan took the win.\nA post race BBQ was a welcome\ntreat for everyone, and once packed\nThe trip proved Instagram friendly. Photo Credit: ICXC\nThe whole gang. Photo Credit: ICXC\nwe spent the afternoon and evening\nenjoying the last of the holiday by,\nof course,finding out just how many\npeople we could fit into the hot tub!\nA huge amount of work from a\nlot of people went into organising\nthe tour and making sure it went off\nwithout a hitch, particularly from\nLiam, Will, Matt, Sarah, Duncan\nand Alex.\nIf you\u2019d like to join the club please\nemail us at run@ic.ac.uk, we\u2019d love to\nhear from you. After all, we didn\u2019t\nwin Sport Imperial Club of the Year\nfor nothing!\nPretty sure taking this picture slowed the runner down. Photo Credit: ICXC\n\n"

Script: Jia\nZhangke. Starring: Zhao Tao,\nZhang Yi, Llang Jingdong. 126\nminutes.\nI\nn the opening scene of\nMountains May Depart, a\ngroup of young Chinese people\ndance to the Pet Shop Boys\u2019\nhit 1993 single Go West. The year is\n1999, and a sense of optimism is in\nthe air, as China heads into a new\nmillennium; director Jia Zhangke\u2019s\neighth feature documents the\nchanges over the next 26 years, as\nJames White\nDir: Josh Mond. Script: Josh Mond.\nStarring: Christopher Abbott,\nCynthia Nixon. 85 minutes.\nT\nhe hype surrounding\nJosh Mond\u2019s debut\nfeature, James White,\nlargely stems from the\nfact that this is the final member\nof production collective Borderline\nFilms \u2013 responsible for Martha\nMarcy May Marlene and Simon\nKiller \u2013 to step into the driver\u2019s seat.\nHowever, there is much more to be\nexcited about here, as James White\nproves to be a solid, confident piece\nof filmmaking.\nThe titular character is a hard-drinking, fast-living New Yorker,\nplayed by Christopher Abbott of\nGirls fame, whose life is brought\nto a halt, first by the death of\nhis estranged father, then by his\nmother\u2019s development of terminal\ncancer. Abbott manages a tricky\nbalancing act: creating one of the\nmost self-centred characters I have\nseen on screen, only to turn things\naround in the closing half-hour\nwith some emotionally devastating\nscenes.\nHis performance is supported\nby a nuanced turn from Cynthia\nDixon as his mother, who manages\nto convey the agony of cancer with\ngreat physicality.\nMond\u2019s years in the producing seat\nhas clearly equipped him well for\nthis feature, and his direction style\nis certainly assertive, with Abbott\u2019s\nface in extreme close-up for much\nof the film, creating a disconcerting\nlack of distance between him and\nthe audience. James White is a\nfilm that is difficult to enjoy, but\nimpossible not to admire.\nChina follows the Pet Shop Boys\u2019\nadvice, hurtling into a new world\nof state-controlled capitalism at the\nemotional expense of its citizens.\nSplit into three parts \u2013 1999,2014,\nand 2025 \u2013 we follow the life of\nTao, a woman from Zhangke\u2019s own\nhometown, Fenyang, whose path is\nshaped by China\u2019s economic destiny.\nIn 1999 she spurns Liangzi (Liang\nJingdon), a coal miner, in favour of\nthe wealthier entrepreneur Zhang\n(Zhang Yi), and has a son called\nDollar, a mark of the influence of\nWestern consumerism.\nBy 2014 Tao has divorced, and\nmeets up with her son one last time\nbefore he emigrates to Australia\nwith his father, now a powerful\nmagnate.\nFinally, the action jumps forward\nto 2025,where Dollar \u2013 having lived\nin Australia for most of his adult\nGrandma\nDir: Paul Weitz. Script: Paul Weitz.\nStarring: Lily Tomlin, Julia Garner,\nMarcia Gay Harden, Laverne Cox.\n80 minutes.\nT\nhose who are rightly\nworried about the\nnumber of current films\nfailing the Bechdel\nTest (are there two named female\ncharacters who talk to each other\nabout something other than a\nman?) will take solace in the release\nof Grandma. A breezy comedy\nfrom writer/director Paul Weitz,\nGrandma passes within the first\nminute, as aging lesbian poet Elle\n(Lily Tomlin) breaks up with her\nmuch younger girlfriend Olivia\n(Marcia Gay Harden), calling\ntheir relationship \u2018just a footnote\u2019\nin the tale of her life. While such\ncallousness seems be par for the\ncourse with Elle,it is understandable\nin context: she is still reeling from\nthe recent death of her long-term\npartner.\nThe plot\u2019s drive is introduced in the\nform of granddaughter Sage (rising\nstar Julia Garner), who comes to\nElle asking to borrow money for an\nabortion.What follows is a road-trip\naround friends and acquaintances,\ncalling in old favours in return for\ncold cash, that generally follows the\nsame route that similar odd-couple\ncomedies have furrowed in the past.\nWhile the film has a light,\nconvivial atmosphere \u2013 aided\nby a naturalistic palate from\ncinematographer Tobius Datum \u2013\nthe subjects discussed are a different\nmatter: abortion, sexuality, and grief\nall form key motifs. This depth, and\nthe astonishing performance from\nTomlin, makes this film more than\nthe sum of its parts.\nFRED FYLES\nFilm Editor\nRemainder\nDir: Omer Fast. Script: Omer Fast.\nStarring: Tom Sturridge, Cush\nJumbo, Ed Speleers, Arsher Ali. 97\nminutes.\nT\nhere are perhaps many\nlabels that you can place\non Omer Fast\u2019s first\nfeature film, Remainder:\nhaunting; unnerving; perhaps, if\nyou\u2019re feeling dispirited: pretentious.\nBut one thing you definitely cannot\ncall it is derivative.\nBased on the novel by Tom\nMcCarthy \u2013 who, incidentally, has\nbeen nominated for this year\u2019s Man\nBooker Prize \u2013 Remainder is a dark,\ntwisting tale, involving a young man\nwho is crushed by an object falling\nfrom the sky. After an uncertain\nperiod of time, he returns to the\nworld, without his memories, but\nmillions of pounds richer thanks\nto the settlement case. As old\nmemories begin to filter through,\nthe man becomes obsessed with\nrecreating the visions he believes\nhold the key to unlocking the past.\nCats tied to rooftops, old women\nfrying liver, faceless stand-ins,\nwhose role is to inhabit rather than\nexpress an idea. These all feature in\nhis scheme. As the film progresses\nwe seem to get closer to the truth,\nbut the goalposts keep on being\nmoved, and really nothing in this\nworld is certain.\nTom Sturridge is brilliantly\nbrooding as the unnamed man, and\nwith his prominent jawline and\nheavy intonation, reminded me of\nIwan Rheon\u2019s character in the TV\nseries Misfits. The comparisons do\nnot stop there: the entire production\nseems to be imbued with the\nfamiliar-yet-unfamiliar spirit that\nChannel 4 productions manage\nto capture so well (think Misfits,\nUtopia, or Black Mirror). Fast takes\na look at the decay that lurks at the\nheart of modern society, taking it\napart with scalpel-like precision.\nThe script, with its heavy, evocative\nlanguage, seemed to be perhaps\nbetter suited to the stage, but it\nworks nevertheless.\nWhere Remainder really stands\nout is in Fast\u2019s unique vision; a\ncontemporary artist by trade, his\nlife \u2013 has forgotten Chinese, and\nhas problems communicating with\nhis traditionalist father, while Tao\nlanguishes alone in Fenyang.\nA thoughtful, evocative mediation\non the passing of time and the nature\nof change, Mountains May Depart\nis built around the emotional core\nprovided by long-time collaborator\nZhao Tao, whose performance of\nTao is wonderfully nuanced. While\nlacking the Tarintino-esque energy\nof his last film, A Touch of Sin, and\nsuffering from a sudden change of\ntone in the last section (which can\nperhaps be explained by the fact\nthat it is mostly in English, leading\nto clunky dialogue that feels much\nless naturalistic than the previous\nsections), Mountains May Depart\nis a clever, exploration of the effect\nof Westernisation on China, seen\nthrough the microcosm of a single\nwoman\u2019s life. Now entering his\nmiddle age,Zhangke has clearly lost\nnone of the energy that directed his\nearly works, and remains probably\nthe most important Chinese\nfilmmaker working today.\nMountains\nMay Depart\nshows us that\nJia Zhangke\nremains one\nof the most\nimportant\nChinese\nfilmmakers of\nour time\nwork involves rearranging existing\nvideos into new works of visual art.\nThis practice has clearly played\ninto this feature, allowing Fast\nto convey the film in a new visual\nlanguage \u2013 a similar case can be seen\nwith other directors who have made\nthe move from contemporary art,\nsuch as Clio Barnard, or Miranda\nJuly.\nLike it or loathe it, Remainder\nis certainly a film that provides\nquestions to ponder on, for which\nperhaps there are no answers. Call it\npretentious if you will, but I think it\nwas sublime.\nDollar and Tao (Zhao Tao), in Jia Zhangke\u2019s masterful Mountains May Depart Photo Credit: New Wave Films\nSuffragette: Oscar Bait?\nSuffragette\nDir: Sarah Gavron. Script: Abi\nMorgan. Starring: Carey Mulligan,\nHelena Bonham Carter, Meryl\nStreep, Ben Wishaw. 106 minutes.\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nT\no call Suffragette \u2018Oscar\nBait\u2019 would probably be\na tad unfair. The term\nconjures up all kinds\nof negative imagery: a mawkish,\noverbearing soundtrack that tugs\nat the heartstrings; a star-studded\ncast in which someone pretends to\nhave a disability; Forrest Gump. But\nif we look at the elements that make\nup director Sarah Gavron\u2019s latest\nfeature, it is difficult to come to any\nother conclusion.\nA historical drama that focuses\non the history of the women\u2019s\nsuffrage movement in the UK at\nits height, Suffragette manages to\nconjure up the theme of the march\nof progress coming up against the\nideas of the past. Beginning with\nsteamy shots of a cramped laundry,\nwhose conditions resemble those\nof Milton\u2019s dark satanic mills, we\nare introduced to Maud (Carey\nMulligan), whose short life has\nlargely been spent washing others\u2019\nclothes, to the detriment of her\nhealth. While her home life is\nhappy \u2013 with Ben Wishaw playing\nher initially-loving husband, Sonny\n\u2013 she seems to yearn for something\nmore. Finding a new life within the\nWomen\u2019s Social and Political Union\n(WSPU), she begins to take part in\ncivil disobedience and violence.\nWhile there was concern from the\ninitial trailer that hearing Mulligan\ngive her best attempt at an East\nEnd accent would be toe-curlingly\nembarrassing, her performance is\nactually quite believable. Her time\non stage \u2013 recently starring in a\nrevival of Skylight \u2013 has clearly paid\noff, and her acting style is incredibly\nnaturalistic. It is also interesting to\nsee how physical she has become as\nan actor, imbuing her character with\na series of jerky movements, which\nseem to develop into psychological\ntics as the strain the establishment\nplaces on her increases.\nMulligan\u2019s performance is\nsupported by a strong cast of\nwomen: Helena Bonham Carter\nplays Edith, the well-educated\nchemist whose shop becomes\na nexus for the movement, and\ninternational treasure Meryl Streep\nstars as the movement\u2019s leader,\nEmmeline Pankhurst. Streep\u2019s\nrole in the film is a small one, but\nher natural charisma means every\nsecond counts. Anne-Marie Duff\u2019s\ncharacter of Violet, the fellow\nlaundry worker who turns Maud\nonto the movement, is a highlight,\nforming a solid pillar upon which\nthe film rests.\nThe script,penned by Abi Morgan,\nwho is fast becoming a British\ninstitution, manages to breathe\nlife into the story, creating largely-believable characters, only some of\nwhom \u2013 such as Emily Wilding\nDavison (Natalie Press) \u2013 were real-life figures, the rest standing more\nfor concepts of femininity.However,\nit would be an achievement to make\na limpid script, given the fascinating\nsubject matter, and there is a slight\nsense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with the pacing of\nthe film. In the past couple of years\nwe have seen a formula developed\nfor period pieces that centre a\n\u2018controversial-at-the-time\u2019 issue,\nand Suffragette seems to follow it\nto the letter: we are introduced\nto the action through an initially\nreticent figure with whom we can\nsympathise (see: Pride); the film\nworks its way to an emotional and\nphysical climax that, with the gift of\nhindsight, we know is coming (see:\nThe King\u2019s Speech); and before the\ncredits roll we are given a glimpse\nof real-life news footage of the era\n(see: Selma). That\u2019s not to say that\nthis is a bad thing, or that the film\ndoesn\u2019t work, just that we seem to\nbe heading down well-trodden\nterritory.\nThe film avoids falling into the\ntypical costume drama trap of\nfeeling staid, thanks largely to\nGavron\u2019s direction; up to four\nhandheld cameras were used at one\ntime, creating an atmosphere that\nnever seems dour,but instead rightly\nholds up the work of the Suffragettes\nas vital, vibrant, and fresh. The\ncolour palate of the film, based on\nthe movement\u2019s now-iconic purple,\nwhite and green flag, is noticeable,\nbut never overpowering.\nWhile the film\u2019s focus on the\nworking-class heart of the suffrage\nmovement is very welcome, the\nlack of women of colour strikes a\ndiscordant note, especially when\nwe know that South Asian women\nin particular did contribute to the\npressure on government. I am sure\nthat in the coming weeks there\nwill be a deluge of thinkpieces on\nthis issue, so I will not dwell on it\nany longer. Suffice to say: if you\u2019re\nlooking for BME women, they ain\u2019t\nthere.\nSuffragette is an instinctively\nappealing film to watch. By and\nlarge, the audience is already on\nthe characters\u2019 side, seeing universal\nsuffrage as a sacred right (although,\nthe statistics at the end of the film\nshowing the dates that different\ncountries adopted this policy would\nindicate otherwise); right from\nthe get-go, we can empathise with\nMaud, a character for whom the\nforces of patriarchy have been near-literally crippling. Hit then with\na series of excellent performances,\nand a visit from Streep herself (by\nnow the closest thing cinema has\nto Jesus), and we have little choice\nbut to stay glued to our seats. On\nreflection, however, it is possible to\nnotice things that don\u2019t sit right:\nthe formulaic story arcs, the way\ncharacters stand more for ideas than\npeople, and the oversimplification\nof the background characters (we\nalready know that the laundry\nowner is evil, do we really need to\nsee him sexually assault a child for\nthe message to be clear?) \u2013 these all\nadd up to a film that is solid, and,\nwhile not staid, definitely imbued\nwith a sense of worthiness. It will\nwin a lot of Oscars.\nSuffragette is released on 12th\nOctober\nViolet (Anne-Marie Duff) and Maud (Carey Mulligan), in Sarah Gavron\u2019s Suffragette.

He thinks she groomed him for\nmonths. But neither is sure.\nNeverbeforehasaworkofartmade\nme as angry, disgusted and upset as\nConsensual. An utterly disgraceful\ndepiction of young people and\nsexual assault, the National Youth\nTheatre (NYT) should be appalled\nand ashamed at this production.\nPushing the boundaries of poor\ntaste and acceptable behaviour, this\nis miles past anything I have ever\nseen on stage.\nI joined the NYT in 2013 and my\nexperience with them was one of\nthe most rewarding and enjoyable\ntimes in my life. The primary\nambassador for young theatre in\nBritain, NYT represents thousands\nof aspiring actors and many of the\nstage\u2019s greatest names have passed\nthrough their doors.\nFrom their vast numbers, sixteen\nmembers are chosen each year to\ntake part in the NYT Rep company,\na free of charge training scheme\nwhich ends in a series of west\nend performances. Whether this\nexcuses a lack of professionalism\nin Consensual is debatable, but\nthe fact that these hugely talented\nyoung people are forced to perform\nthis painfully stereotyped, rancid\nmaterial is a real tragedy. I was\nproud to be a member of NYT \u2013 this\nproduction leaves me disappointed\nand embarrassed.\nWritten by the award winning\nEvan Placey, Consensual claims\nto be an explosive, thought-provoking piece about sexual\nconsent, but it\u2019s not. This play\nsystematically trivialises rape and\ndepicts the average teenager as\nrude, uncontrollable and stupid.\nThe premise isn\u2019t necessarily\nunworkable and I am in no way\naverse to controversial theatre, but\nthe execution is ethically all over the\nplace. Jokes are thrown in left right\nand centre and it seems impossible\nfor any character, not just the kids,\nto go two minutes without making\nsome obnoxious, unnecessary\nremark for comic effect. What\u2019s\nfunny about rape? Nothing \u2013 but\nsomehow the audience can\u2019t stop\nlaughing.\nTo end the play, in a decision\nthat continues to baffle me, Diane\nand Freddie are shown having sex\non stage. Whether in good taste or\nnot, the production continues to\ninvite laughter to an image which\nis frankly horrifying. I do not doubt\nthat Placey had the best intentions\nwhen writing this play, but I fear\nfor the victim of sexual assault who\nwitnesses this work.\nThere are glaring inconsistencies\nrunning throughout the script and\ncharacter development is completely\nunbelievable. Classic moments of\nNYT ensemble work and a number\nof scene changes are accompanied\nby the year 11 class rapping are\nto an extent impressive, but to\nwhich purpose I do not know. The\ndirection at the start of the second\nhalf shows some potential, but\nmost moments feel forced and the\nactions of multiple characters are\nunacceptable and unjustified. It is\na real shame because I can honestly\nsay that the performance of Lauren\nLyle as Diane is outstanding and\nthe rest of the cast work well with\nthe material they are given, but they\ncan in no way redeem the travesty\nwhich is Consensual.\nIn his programme notes, Placey\nmentions how he wanted to\nexplore the complexity behind a\nteacher/student relationship and I\nunderstand why. As wrong as the act\nis, nothing is ever black and white\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nand no question about relationships\nis ever simple. But execution is\neverything and Consensual lacked it\nall.The approach this play has taken\nis horrific, and no good intentions\ncan excuse the end result. With\nno moral path, no boundaries\nand no respect, Consensual is an\nembarrassment.\nConsensual is on at the Ambassador\u2019s\nTheatre until December\nThe National Youth Theatre knows no boundaries in this dire depiction of rape\nMembers of the NYT Rep Company.

However,\nmost of his career has taken place in\nhis native Germany.\nUntil his appointment at the\nBritish Museum, he was director of\nthe Staatliche Kunstsammlungen\n(State Art Collection) in Dresden,\nand previously the Folkswang\nMuseum in Basel. This will have\ngiven him the experience of looking\nafter historic priceless collections,\nbut being at the helm of the\nBritish Museum will quite another\neperience.\nFischer will have big shoes to fill\nat his new role. MacGregor has\npresided over something of a golden\nage in the museum\u2019s history. The\nBritish Museum has become one of\nthe world\u2019s most visited museums,\nsurpassed only by the Louvre; it\nwelcomed 6.7 million people visited\nin 2014.\nThe History of the World in 100\nObjects exhibition will be touring\nChina as part of the a soft power\napproach to improving relations\nwith the economic giant.\nMacgregor was also instrumental\nin resisting the return of antiquities,\nparticularly the Parthenon marbles.\nThese foreign antiquities form the\nbedrock of the British Museum\u2019s\ncollection, their would be disastrous\nto the organisation.\nFischer will have to find new\nways to maintain this success. His\nexpertise is in 20th\ncentury art;\nDr Hartwig Fischer Photo Credit: British Museum\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nMuseum appoints first foreign\ndirector since 19th Century\nTom Lucy.\nIt\u2019s early days\nfor this young\nclub but I\nexpect drastic\nimprovement\npretty quickly\nMacGregor\u2019s was in classical art,\nit will be interesting to see how\nthis difference manifests in their\napproaches to setting the direction\nfor the future of the British\nMuseum.\nThe best in budget stand-up\nY\noung, fun and edgy, The\nComedy Tree\u2019s rebirth\nin Hammersmith shows\nflashes of brilliance at an\nunrivalled price.\nHaving left their Putney venue\nafter thirteen years, The Comedy\nTree still needs to find its feet but\ninklings of long term potential are\nthere. While the laughs will always\nbe the focus of a good comedy club,\nthe buzz of the best venues offer\nan experience second tier clubs\ncan\u2019t match. The Comedy Tree has\na sharp young line-up, but three\nweeks into their new venue,the club\nhasn\u2019t found its groove. The space is\nflash but the room feels a little large\nfor an under filled club.Would I just\nchill in a room like this? Probably\nnot. Of course this will improve\nas The Comedy Tree solidifies its\ncrowd and learns how best to use its\nspace but they aren\u2019t there yet.\nWith a changing line-up, each\nweek will of course vary, but the acts\nI saw suggest a knack for booking\nquality up-and-coming young\ncomedians. With the eighteen\nyear-old Tom Lucy standing\nout as a future star, the line-up\nwas rounded off by newcomers\nFrancis Foster, George Lewis, and\nheadliner Gordon Southern. Foster\nand Lewis both show signs of their\ninexperience but the laughs are\nfrequent and well judged.\nFoster is funny but can feel\nquite simple and Lewis has an\nextraordinary knack for one liners\nbut lacks the filler needed for a full\nset. Southern is a wicked wordsmith\nwith an entertaining mix of comic\nrap and dirty charm. His pedigree\nis obvious and he holds himself\nwith confidence. With a sharp,\non the money set, Southern is\nan entertaining comedian who\u2019s\nnot too far from being fantastic.\nOccasionally his material drags a\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nlittle and his pace drops towards\nthe end, but the overall result is\nimpressive.\nWithout going into detail, I\nmust commend Tom Lucy for an\nexemplary set by a young comedian.\nWith perfect timing and a superbly\nclever progression, Lucy has an\nalmost unrivalled ability to lure his\naudience into a laugh and subvert\nour expectations \u2013 I\u2019d be amazed if\nwe don\u2019t see a lot more of him in the\nyears to come.\nThe lasting impression from The\nComedy Tree is somewhat mixed.\nIt\u2018s early days for this young club but\nI expect drastic improvement pretty\nquickly. The bar is expensive, so any\ntrip requires a substantial pre-drink,\nbut the ticket price is as good as it\ngets. Realistically,The Comedy Tree\nisn\u2019t something I\u2019d make a date out\nof, but if you\u2019re free on a Thursday,\nthere aren\u2019t many better things to do.\nEvery Thursday from 7.30pm\nTickets for Students from \u00a36\nHammersmith\u2019s newest comedy club shows great potential but has work to do\n\n"

Pete\nDoherty\u2019s (vocals/guitar) descent\ninto a serious crack cocaine and\nheroin addiction caused tensions\nin the band, particularly between\nhimself and other front man Carl\nPeter Munton\nWriter\nBar\u00e2t which ultimately led to the\nend of the band 11 years ago. The\nmedia\u2019s coverage of Doherty\u2019s drug\naddiction and involvement in crime\ndestroyed the band\u2019s reputation,\nmaking it almost unthinkable that\nthe music industry (or the public)\nwould ever welcome them back into\nmainstream music culture.\nHowever, after a series of\nsuccessful reunion gigs in 2010,\nincluding both Reading and Leeds\nfestivals, a reformation looked\nincreasingly likely. It was not until\nthe beginning of 2015, after it\nwas announced that Doherty had\nsuccessfully completed his rehab\ntreatment in Thailand, that The\nLibertines returned to the studio to\nrecord their third album.\nThe anticipation surrounding\nthe band\u2019s reunion led to a\nunprecedented hype focused on\ntheir headline slots. Questions were\nbeing asked: has Doherty\u2019s and\nBar\u00e2t\u2019s relationship finally been\nrecovered? Will they ever be as\ngood as they used to be? Will their\nperformance live up to the hype?\nWith a ticket for the Sunday\nof Reading Festival, I was\noverwhelmingly excited to see them\nfor the first time. But this would\nhappen before expected.\nIn June, they performed as special\nguests on the Pyramid stage at\nGlastonbury, replacing the hole that\nthe Foo Fighters and Dave Grohl\u2019s\nbroken leg had left. Throughout\nthe day rumours spread across the\nGlastonbury site about who the\nThe suprise replacement headliners seemed triumphant after their career-spanning set.

On a sunny Somerset\nevening, crowds lined the field\nwaiting expectedly for a special\nguest worthy of the Pyramid stage.\nThe rumours did not disappoint\nas the likely lads charged onto the\nstage blasting out \u2018The Delaney\u2019\nwith such enthusiasm that they\nreceived a huge roar from the tens\nof thousands in the crowd.\nThey thundered through their set\nwhich included songs from their\nnew album such as the live debut of\n\u2018Anthems for Doomed Youth\u2019 (the\ntitle track) as well as old classics\nlike \u2018Can\u2019t Stand Me Now\u2019 to the\nupmost joy of the festival goers.\nThey finished off their set with a\nrendition of \u2018Don\u2019t Look Back Into\nthe Sun\u2019which left fans chanting for\nmore.\nThe crowds left the stage certainly\nfeeling surprised.The appearance of\nThe Libertines may well have even\nbeen a surprise to the band members\nthemselves as the replacement\nwould\u2019ve been so last minute and\npotentially rushed.\nThis was somewhat evident in the\nband\u2019s first live festival performance\nof the year; their set seemed a little\nclunky and chaotic, lacking the\npolished look and sound that one\nwould expect from such a skilled\nquartet. Being such an unexpected\ngig, this could not be held against\nPhoto Credit: Virgin Records\nMadness\nensued as\nthe likely\nlads made\ntheir way\nthrough the\nhit heavy\nset long into\nthe night\nthem, as replacement shows have a\nreputation of not always living up\nto standards. It was going to be very\ninteresting to see The Libertines\nheadlining Reading, a night that\nthey had prepared and rehearsed for\nheavily in advance.\nWhen the moment finally came\nfor their performance at Reading,\nthere was the feeling that the newly\nreformed band had to fight to prove\nThe media\u2019s\ncoverage of\nDoherty\u2019s\ndrug\naddiction\ndestroyed\nthe\nreputation\nof the band\nthemselves worthy to be back at the\ntop.The intro of Vera Lynne\u2019s \u2018We\u2019ll\nMeet Again\u2019 softly hummed out\nof the speakers, consequently the\npacked crowd chorused along to the\nfamous lyrics.The air of anticipation\nwas at its highest.\nAs the band members made their\nway onto stage kicking off with\n\u2018Horror Show\u2019,the audience erupted\ninto a series of mosh pits, crowd\nsurfers and red hot burning flares\nlighting up the night sky. Madness\nensued as the likely lads made\ntheir way through the hit heavy\nset long into the night. The energy\nand precision of the performance\nrenewed their previously damaged\nreputation and earned them a place\nat the top of raging rock music.\nTheir third studio album Anthems\nfor Doomed Youth was released on\nthe 11th\nof September. The chaotic\nsounds of their 2004 album The\nLibertines has been replaced by\na more mature and witty elegiac\nsound, perhaps an indication of all\nthey have been through.\nSome argue that it is their best\nalbum yet; whatever the case it\u2019s\nwell worth a listen. The Libertines\nstart their tour at the beginning of\n2016 and they\u2019ll be playing at the\nO2 arena in London on the 30th of\nJanuary. If you are a Libertines fan\nthis is a show not to miss.\nAnthems for Doomed Youth is\navailable now on Virgin Records\nDrake / Future - What aTime to Be Alive\nCollaborations between hip-hop\nartists in their prime rarely see the\nlight of day. Delays follow delays,\nfollowed by furtherly delayed delays,\nleaving ample time for the novelty\nof the idea to fizzle out (Kanye/\nPharell/Lupe Fiasco) or for artists\nto sufficiently diverge artistically\n(Kendrick/J Cole). It should then\ncome as little surprise that the\nexistence and masterful execution\nof What a Time to Be Alive\u2019s release\nwas not at all expected. Drake\nand Future, two members of \u201915\nhip-hop\u2019s top echelon of rappers,\nreleased their joint mixtape a week\nafter rumors first hit the internet,\nand only months after bagging a\ncritically acclaimed #1 solo album\neach.The first official announcement\nof the tape, live on Apple\u2019s Beats 1\nradio, was immediately followed\nby its leak-free debut, providing a\nshared listening experience rarely\nseen these days. If nothing else, it\nshould serve as an example of how\nto release an album in the social-media age. What if The Weeknd\ncirca 2011 and FKA twigs delivered\nan EP out of the blue, sans irritating\npre-release promo run? Or Frank\nOcean and James Blake? Or Jay-Z\nand Kanye West (still not over\n\u2018H.A.M.\u2019)?\nFuture is the powerhouse at the\nhelm of hip-hop\u2019s Atlanta-birthed\nmelodic renaissance. Known for\nhypnotically mumbling his way\nAslan Sayfimehr\nWriter\nacross bass-heavy production,\nhis signature raspy cadence and\ntop class melodic talent (he gave\nBeyonc\u00e9 \u2018Drunk In Love\u2019) has\nPhoto Credit: Epic / Cash Money\nWorry not,\nthe staple\nthemes of\nstrippers,\nheartbreak\nand crime\nare all still\nvery present\nIf nothing\nelse, it\nserves as\nan example\nof how to\nrelease an\nalbum in\nsocial media\nage Is this image a metaphor for the powerplay on this mixtape? No.\nPhoto Credit: Williams / WireImage\nmade nearly everything he\u2019s done in\nthe past year downright addictive.\nA mixtape three-peat followed by\nJuly\u2019s stellar DS2 cemented Future\u2019s\nreputation for consistency and\ndedication to his fan-base. Hip hop\npurists be warned- lyrical content\ntakes a backseat to phonetics among\n\u2018New Atlanta\u2019 artists, and Future\nregularly uses auto-tune to further\ngruff-up his voice. Plus, I\u2019m pretty\nsure Future freestyles most of his\nlines; I refuse to believe anyone\ncould actually write down \u201cI put my\nthumb in her butt.\u201d\nDrake\u2019s been running the rap\ngame since 2013. The Lil Wayne\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s presence on a track has\nbecome so synonymous with\na hit that making it without a\nDrake feature is considered an\nachievement in its own right. He\u2019s\nalso a soppy, manipulative middle-class Canadian former child actor\nwho really likes his sandwiches\n(YouTube it). Drake\u2019s initial foray\ninto aggressive chest puffing with\nWorst Behavior felt a tad awkward,\nbut after a year of braggadocios\nfeatures and the rapid fire slew\nof bangers on this years If You\u2019re\nReadingThis It\u2019sToo Late,I think I\u2019m\nok with bearded gym-rat Drizzy 2.0\nand ex-drug dealer Future \u2018Hendrix\u2019\nside by side. Both products of the\nemotionally transparent melody-infused rap pioneered by Kid Cudi\n& Kanye West back in \u201808, yet\nseparated by their widely distant\nsubject matter and deliver, Future\nand Drake had the capacity to make\nsomething really special.\nWhich is why I was pretty\nunderwhelmed after noticing that\nif you leave off the last two tracks,\nWATTBA is a really, really good\nFuture tape with Drake featuring\non every track. The fact that even\nthis disappointment is still one of\nthe best pop-rap releases of the year\nis a testament to the duo\u2019s ability.\nFuture pushes himself lyrically for\nDrake\u2019s audience (no odd orifice\ninsertions or homophobic slurs this\ntime around), delving further into\nhis drug use as a coping mechanism.\nWorry not- the staple themes of\nstrippers, heartbreak and crime are\nall still very present.Throughout the\ntape Future displays his unrivalled\ntalent for conveying emotion\nthrough auto-tuned vocals; his\nhoarse croaks of despair on \u2018Live\nfrom the Gutter\u2019 draw instant\nempathy. The penultimate track,\nFuture\u2019s solo effort \u2018Jersey\u2019, has him\nconfessing his regrets in a defeated,\ngritty panic, and although it\u2019s no\n\u2018Codeine Crazy\u2019, the song ranks\namong his best to date.\nDrake continues to do what he\ndoes best. Jumping on and then\ndeveloping flows lain down by\nFuture, he delivers quotable after\nquotablewithundeniableconfidence\nand precision. The absurd hook on\n\u2018Big Rings\u2019 begs to be belted out\nloud, and his sing-song rapping\nis used to expert effectiveness on\n\u2018Scholarships\u2019.The inflections at the\nend of each of his lines are nothing\nshort of delightful. The tape closes\nwith \u201830 for 30\u2019, a strong contender\nfor Drake\u2019s most technically\nbrilliant song yet, in which he\nglides through gentle pianos over a\nmuffled soul sample punctuated by\nmuted drums, effortlessly switching\nbetween impeccable flows made all\nthe more impressive by the minimal\nbeat.\nThe first thing heard on WATTBA\nis Metro Boomin\u2019s iconic producer\ntag, followed shortly by Southside\u2019s,\nand the two clearly deserve the\nrecognition. Handling the majority\nof the production, their infectious\nsynths and punchy drum patterns\nare guaranteed to incite awkward\nhead-bobs in public. The hazy lean-influence seen on other Future\nreleases is polished and toned down\nfor Drake\u2019s audience, but the beats\nremain very much typical of Future.\nOther personal highlights include\nNeenyo\u2019s ethereal stripper ballad\nin 3/4, \u2018Plastic Bag\u2019; even if I don\u2019t\nfully understand the stripper/client\ndynamic, it\u2019s smooth as hell.\nUnfortunately, Drake and Future\ndon\u2019t interact nearly enough. Bars\nare never traded, and the two\ncapable singers only harmonize\non \u2018Diamonds Dancing\u2019, albeit\nto stunning effect (that is before\nDrake embarks on two minute rant\nto an ex peppered with scoffs and\nharrumphs). Maybe the distance\nis put there for a reason; Drake\nfrequently raps about his rich-womanizer woes immediately after\nFuture\u2019s laments over a dark and\ntroubled past. An amalgamation\nof their two individual styles would\nhave been to die for, but I think\nI\u2019m expecting a bit much from\nsomething recorded in 6 days.\nIf you enjoy well-made contagious\nbangers, listen to What A Time To\nBe Alive. Filled with hard-hitting\npop-rap songs from the biggest in\nthe game, pre-existing fans won\u2019t\nbe left disappointed. Dominated\nby Future\u2019s aesthetic but discernibly\nelevated by Drake\u2019s Midas touch,\nWATTBA raises some questions\nabout the Toronto pop-star\u2019s future.\nIs WATTBA a tactical play, tapping\ninto Future\u2019s notoriously loyal fan\nbase as a safety net for a well overdue\nexperimental solo record, or is it\nmerely asserting his position as the\nprince of rap by releasing what could\nbe his second platinum record of the\nyear? Either way, Drake\u2019s strategy of\njumping on buzzing songs has now\nevolved into latching onto another\nartist\u2019s sound, a far cry from 2013\u2019s\nirrefutable boast of: \u201cGive these\nn*ggas the look, the verse and even\nthe hook/That\u2019s why every song\nsound like Drake featuring Drake.\u201d\nOut now on Epic / Cash Money\n\n"

The annual\nawards are widely regarded as the\nmost prestigious in their respective\nfields.\nRecipients receive a gold medal\nand diploma; each prize is also\nworth \u00a3631,000 which is split evenly\nbetween the winners if several\nshare the award. The Laureates\noften donate their prize money to\nscientific, cultural and humanitarian\ncauses.\nThe prizes were established in\n1895 by Swedish inventor Alfred\nNobel, who bequeathed his fortune\nCecily Johnson\nScience Writer\nPhysiology or Medicine \u2013\nWilliam C.

It described the\npreparation in water of Artemisia\nannua, commonly known as sweet\nwormwood.\nTu\u2019s research determined the\nactive ingredient which was highly\neffective at treating the disease.\nInitial tests in 21 humans with one\nof two forms of malaria found that\nthe extract was effective in wiping\nout both types of parasite.\nProfessor Tu described her prize-winning discovery as \u201ca true gift\nfrom old Chinese medicine\u201d. In an\ninterview after the announcement\nshe said: \u201cI was a little bit surprised,\nbut not really \u2026because [this prize]\nis not an honour just for me, but an\nhonour for all Chinese scientists\u201d.\nThis is the first time in history\nthat the Nobel Prize in Physiology\nor Medicine has been awarded to a\nT\nhe Nobel Assembly at\nKarolinska Institutet\nhas chosen to split the\nawarding of the 2015\nNobel Prize in Physiology or\nMedicine, with one half jointly\ngoing to Irish parasitologist\nWilliam C. Campbell and Japanese\nmicrobiologist Satoshi \u014cmura.\nThe pair were behind the discovery\nof new drug Avermectin, derivatives\nof which have proven to be effective\ntreatments for a number of diseases\ncaused by roundworm parasites.\nTheir work has radically lowered the\nincidence of River Blindness and\nLymphatic Filariasis.\nCombined, these two diseases\naffect more than 100 million people\nworldwide. Those who contract\nLymphatic Filariasis can suffer from\ndisabling swelling, in some cases\nincluding elephantiasis.\nSatoshi \u014cmura made an initial\nbreakthrough after studying soil\nsamples, growing bacteria that were\nfound to produce anti-microbial\ncompounds. William Campbell\nthen found that a particular strain,\nStreptomyces avermitilis, was\nparticularly effective against the\nT\nhe Royal Swedish\nAcademy of Sciences has\nawarded the Nobel Prize\nin Physics for 2015 to\nTakaaki Kajita of the University of\nTokyo and Arthur B. McDonald of\nQueen\u2019s University in Canada.\nThetwophysicistswererecognised\nfor their key contributions to the\nexperiments in the late 1990s and\nearly 2000s, which showed that\nneutrinos are not massless particles.\nFirst predicted in 1930 by\nWolfgang Pauli,neutrinos have zero\nelectric charge and were believed for\nmany years to also have no mass,\npassing through normal matter\nalmost undetected.\nBy constructing two neutrino\ndetectors deep underground, one\nI\nn a second announcement, the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of\nSciences awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Chemistry for 2015\nto Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich\nand Aziz Sancar for their work in\nmapping how cells repair damaged\nDNA, safeguarding the genetic\ninformation.\nTogether the three scientists\nprovided fundamental knowledge\nof how living cells function, which\nis now used in a number of fields\nincluding the development of new\ncancer treatments.\nHuman cells divide billions of\ntimes from the time of conception\nto adulthood, each time unravelling\nand recreating the strands of\nDNA within their nucleus. It was\nlong considered incredible that\nthe genetic information could be\nduplicated so accurately each time.\n\u201cFrom a chemical perspective,\nthis ought to be impossible,\u201d the\nNobel committee stated at the\nprize announcement. \u201cAll chemical\nprocesses are prone to random\nerrors. Additionally, your DNA\nis subjected on a daily basis to\ndamaging radiation and reactive\nmolecules.\n\u201cIn fact, you ought to have been a\nchemical chaos long before you even\ndeveloped into a foetus,\u201dthey added.\nThe trio of scientists who were\nawarded this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in\nChemistry resolved this conundrum\nby figuring out how cells are able to\nrepair the inevitable mutations that\noccur during DNA synthesis.\nIt was Tomas Lindahl who first\ndemonstrated in the 1970s that the\nrate of decay of DNA molecules was\ngreat enough that it ought to make\nthe development of life on Earth\nimpossible. He went on to discover\na piece of molecular machinery\ncalled base excision repair, which\ncontinuously counteracts the\ncollapse of DNA.\nAziz Sancar went on to map\nanother mechanism, nucleotide\nexcision repair, which cells use to\nrepair the damage caused by UV\nrays from the Sun. Those born\nwith defects in this repair system\ndevelop skin cancer when exposed\nto sunlight, making the discovery\ncrucial to cancer research.\nFinally, Paul Modrich was\nLaureates\noften donate\ntheir prize\nmoney to\nscientific,\ncultural and\nhumanitarian\ncauses\nto found the Nobel Foundation\nafter reading an unfavourable\nprematurely released obituary for\nhimself.\nHis legacy created a series\nof awards for individuals who\nbestowed the \u201cgreatest benefit on\nmankind\u201d with their work in in\nphysics, chemistry, physiology or\nmedicine, literature and peace. A\nrelated Nobel Memorial Prize in\nEconomic Sciences was added in\n1968.\nEach Nobel Prize is awarded by an\ninstitution and chosen from a list of\nnames recommended by the Nobel\nCommittee after nominations\nhave been received. The decision is\nannounced immediately after the\nvote takes place.\nThere is often a significant time lag\nbetween the scientific discovery or\nwork recognised by the Nobel Prize\nand its awarding, as the granting\nof prizes is typically delayed until\nthe achievement has been widely\naccepted.\nInset Photo Illustrator: Niklas Elmehed\nMembers of the Nobel Assembly at the announcement. Photo Credit: AP\nin Ontario and the other in Gifu\nprefecture, McDonald and Kajita\nwere able to determine between\nthem that the particles can oscillate\nbetween three types \u2013 muon, tau\nand electron.\nThis mysterious behaviour means\nthat the particles have mass \u2013 albeit\nan almost immeasurably tiny mass.\nThe new discovery was hugely\nimportant for physics. \u201cWhen you\ndo not know whether they have\nmass, it\u2019s otherwise difficult to\nunderstand how to incorporate\nthem into those theories that give us\na more fundamental understanding\nof the world of physics,\u201d McDonald\nsaid in an interview.\n\u201cWe are very satisfied that we\nhave been able to add to the world\u2019s\nknowledge at a very fundamental\nlevel. This recognition is a\ntremendous accolade for our group\u201d.\nresearcher from China. By splitting\nthe award, the Committee chose to\nhonour two different research teams\nfighting a common battle against\nparasitic infections.\n\u201cThetwodiscoverieshaveprovided\nhumankind with powerful new\nparasites associated with domestic\nand farm animals.\nThe team headed up by Campbell\nwas able to isolate the compound\nAvermectin, developing it into an\nentirely new class of drugs to treat\nthe parasitic worm infections in\nhumans. The US-based company\nMerck, which housed the team,\nannounced in 1987 that it would\nmake the drug Ivermectin available\nto all free of charge.\nCampbell initially did not believe\nthe news of his prize after being\nwoken by a call from a reporter.\nIn a statement to the press he\nemphasised the significance of the\nrest of his team\u2019s contribution to the\ndiscovery.\nHe also urged scientists to\ncontinue to search the natural world\nfor inspiration in developing new\ntreatments:\u201cOne of the big mistakes\nwe\u2019ve made all along is that there\nis a certain amount of hubris in\nhumans thinking that we can create\nmolecules as well as nature can\u201d.\nSatoshi \u014cmura said that he was\n\u201cvery surprised\u201d to be receiving the\nprize, but would \u201chumbly accept\u201d it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very happy day\u201d.\nmeans to combat these debilitating\ndiseases that affect hundreds\nof millions of people annually,\u201d\nthe Nobel committee said. \u201cThe\nconsequences in terms of improved\nhuman health and reduced suffering\nare immeasurable\u201d.\nrecognised for his demonstration\nof a mechanism called mismatch\nrepair, which explains how living\ncells correct those errors that occur\nwhen DNA is replicated during cell\ndivision, reducing the frequency of\nmistakes.\nThe secretary general of the Royal\nSwedish Academy of Sciences,\nG\u00f6ran Hansson, announced the\nwinners of the prize in Stockholm\nsaying:\u201cThis year\u2019s prize is about the\ncell\u2019s toolbox for repairing DNA\u201d.\nHe explained that the new Nobel\nLaureates have each \u201cprovided\nfundamental insights into how cells\nfunction\u201d.\n\n"

For the newbies amonst\nyou, as the Angry Grad (AG from\nnow on, because acronyms are hip,\nand who has time to speak in full\nsentences these days - not me,\nI\u2019m too busy looking for a job) I\nendeavour to rant about all things\nof utmost importance.My topic this\nweek is far more pressing than the\npresidential election, more stressful\nthan junior doctor contract reform,\nand yes, more heart-wrenching than\nZayn leaving 1D. This week, we\ndiscuss why humanity violates my\nsoul,based on the most liked photos\non Instagram.\nAt number five, with 2.3\nmillion likes, we have Kylie Jenner\ngraduating from high school. To\nbe fair to the kid, I\u2019m suprised\nshe bloody got there. She\u2019s had a\npretty tough year, and I\u2019m not even\ntalking about the whole Caitlyn\nthing. Balancing that mega pout\nwith organic chemistry sounds\nmore stressful than BSc finals, and\ncombined with the fact that her lip\nfillers get more publicity than the\nUSA\u2019s drone strikes, means that this\nlady has had one arduous fucking\nyear. But hey, she made it, and you\nguys rooted for her.\nOh sorry, what did you say 12 year\nold girl? Who do you want to be like\nwhen you grow up? Indra Nooyi,\nthe female CEO of PepsiCo? Edith\nWharton, the writer who exposed\nclass conflict and social hypocrisy?\nOh, Kylie Jenner, rocking the duck\nface on graduation day? Okay, I\u2019m\nfully aware that I can\u2019t moan too\nmuch because in a way, this picture\ndoes promote education, especially\nfor women, but it just pisses me off\nthat this photo is more appreciated\nthan snaps of Oprah Winfrey or\nHilary Clinton getting up to their\nown ground-breaking antics. The\nfact that kids these days, and myself\nincluded here, know more about the\nKardashians than they do about the\nKorean crisis makes me despair.\nNumber four boasts Kimmy\nand Kanye playing tonsil tennis on\ntheir wedding day, which received\n2.4 million double taps. Well done\nworld, that amount of appreciation\nmust have gone straight to Yeezy\u2019s\nalready hyper-inflated ego, but at\nleast Kim\u2019s arse can balance it out.\nThis photo is quite sweet really, but\nthe miserable douche in me finds\nthis amount of class unsettling when\nit comes from the Kardashian-West\nclan. I mean, Kan-ye not?\nI want to see Kanye ruining\naward shows, or talking about how\nhe invented leather pants in Latin\ntimes and sold the idea to Virgil.\nI mean, if this photo declares that\nKimye are modern day advocates\nof matrimony, we must also assume\nthat the league tables are right, and\nUCL is better than Imperial. We\nall know that Jay-onc\u00e9 are the true\nI mean,\nKan-ye not?\nBack by popular demand, and more bitter than ever, this week\nthe angry grad is coming for the most liked photos on Instagram.\nEvidently,\ngive a girl\nflowers\nand she\u2019ll\nShake It\nOff.\nFeast your eyes on these, the greatest\nachievements of our time. Clockwise\nfrom top left, Kenner graduates,\nKardashian-West snoggage, TaylorHarris horseplay, Taylor\u2019s humblebrag\nand the most liked picture on all of Insta\n- Kendall Jenner, who couldn\u2019t even\nkeep her eyes open for the photo. Photo\nCredit: Instagram / Kylie Jenner / Kim\nKardashian / Taylor Swift / Kendall Jenner\nking and queen, so why the world is\ntrying to fuck with the monarchy, I\ndo not know.\nOf course Taylor ruddy Swift\nhas to feature somewhere, and she\nnabs the number three spot with\na totes adorbs snap of her and\nher bae, Calvin Harris.

Who fucking knows.\nI cry male tears for Bahar Mustafa\nA cis white man on what he thinks about the welfare officer who said #killallwhitemen\nJonathan Masters\nComment Writer\nWhen the media scrolled back through Bahar Mustafa\u2019s tweets, they found a\ntreasure trove of \u201cstories\u201d.\nB\nahar Mustafa is the\nWelfare and Diversity\nOfficer of Goldsmiths,\nUniversity of London and\nfor the second time whilst in her\nposition she has come under fire for\ncomments made through twitter.\nShe previously entered public\nconsciousness after requesting that\nno white men attend a BME non-binary and women\u2019s meeting, and\nthen because of various activities on\nsocial media. An image posted to\ntwitter displayed her mock crying in\nfront of a sign reading \u201cno white cis-men pls\u201dand now her tweeting using\nthe hashtag \u201c#killallwhitemen\u201d has\nsurfaced once again. The reason she\nhas resurfaced yet again is that she\nhas been charged for these actions:\nthe first being that of sending\na communication conveying a\nthreatening message between 10th\nWe deserve\nfreedom of\nspeech, no\nmatter what\nthat speech\nis\nThe ever\npresent\nspectre\nof sexism\nstill lingers\nwithin our\nsociety\nNovember, 2014 and 31st\nMay,\n2015; and the second is for sending\na grossly offensive message via a\npublic communication network\nbetween the same dates.Ms Mustafa\nis set to appear before magistrates at\nBromley magistrates court on the\n5th\nNovember.\nNow as you might imagine,as a cis\nwhite male (that is, identifying with\nthe gender I was asigned at birth) it\nis with great trepidation that I write\nthis article.However,I feel that in all\nhonesty,although her actions within\nthe public eye were idiotic, I do not\nbelieve that she should have been\ncharged for these acts. For me the\ncrux of the issue comes under the\nalmost clich\u00e9 value that we deserve\nfreedom of speech, no matter what\nthat speech is. The fact that Bahar\nMustafa is being prosecuted is a\ndisgusting violation of this, and\nalthough my own personal views are\nin direct contention with hers, it is\npossible to support her whilst she\nundergoes this process.\nFirst of all what must be dealt\nwith are the views she holds; I\ndo not agree with her brand of\nfeminism remotely. I perceive it\nas an aggressive, alienating, and,\nfrankly, insidiously nasty personal\nbrand. However, it is unacceptable\nthat she is not allowed to express\nthese views in whatever way she\nsees fit, and with social media being\nthe quickest way to convey your\nviews,Twitter would seem like a fair\noption.\nTo put this into balance I think\nit\u2019s worth considering the various\nother social figures that continually\nsend communications carrying\nthreatening and grossly offensive\nmessages, who continually spew\ntheir verbal faeces all across social\nmedia and in print, who receive no\ncomeuppance. Of course I\u2019m talking\nabout the woman who says offensive\nthings instead of mustering the\nenergy to come up with anything\nvaguely insightful to say: Katie\nHopkins. From refusing to speak\nto fat children, to comparing\nasylum seekers to cockroaches,\nthis woman has built a career out\nof being grossly offensive, and yet\nshe seems to become more and\nmore successful the more vitriol\nshe emits. On the other side of\nthe spectrum, the grossly offensive\n\u2018Dapper Laughs\u2019 goes from rape\njoke to leery objectification in a\nblink of an eye, and yet there is no\nform of prosecution towards him\neither. I believe that the reason\nBahar Mustafa is being singularly\npersecuted is a lack of understanding\nand a stubbornness to progress\nsocially.\nThe ever present spectre of\nsexism still lingers within our\nsociety. Although there is definitely\nprogression within all sectors, the\nidea of new schools of thought\nwithin a movement that too many\nperceive as a homogenous idealism\nare reflected here. For example, the\nchange.org petition to have Bahar\nMustafa removed from her position\nwas started and campaigned for by a\nwhite man at a completely different\nuniversity, citing that he worried\n\u201cabout the future of Britain, free\nspeech and the ability to be whom\nyou are\u201d. As a result of her tweets\nand the publicity of the whole\nepisode,Mustafa received numerous\ndeath threats, as well as rape threats,\nand the fact that none of these have\nbeen followed up by the police/\nbeen publicised in the media seems\nextremely odd.\nI would rather see the culture,\nperpetuated by the likes of the\naforementioned Dapper Laughs,\ntargeted more proactively, rather\nthan this particular brand of\nfeminism. For some reason he\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be a priority when\ntargeting grossly offensive messages.\nI feel as though if this hadn\u2019t been\ngiven the publicity it was by the\nmedia, this case would not have\nbeen followed up to the extent that\nit has been.\nHer case also raises the issue of\ntwitter as a platform for ideas and\nviews. If you want to share your\npersonal philosophy with the world,\nwhy not use a network that can\nconvey this instantly? Because if\nBahar is a sabbatical officer at Goldsmiths. Can you imagine one of our\nsabbs being this controversial?\ncertain people disagree with your\nviews it could land you in Bromley\nmagistrates court. Social media has\nbrought a new age of connectivity\nand broadcasting content has almost\naccidentally ushered in an ominous\ncloud of censorship, ready to strike\ndown those that hold risky looking\nviews, leading to a general anxiety\nover whether or not we should ever\ntweet an opinion.\nThe final point I want to make\nis this: a platform for sharing\nideas does not give credence or\nincitement to those deemed \u2018grossly\noffensive\u2019, moreover it provides a\nbigger platform to ridicule, discuss,\nand even perhaps understand them,\nwhich is far more than sending\nsomeone to court over a tweet can\never do.\n\n"

A man\nwhose work stems from the space\nhe inhabits, the idea that he could\nbe anywhere quite appeals to me.\nHaving been completely\nabsorbed by Absent earlier in the\nweek \u2013 Tristan\u2019s new installation\nat Shoreditch Town Hall \u2013 I am\nonly too aware of this man\u2019s creative\npower. There are many wondrous,\npowerful artworks that can captivate\nan audience,but few art forms are as\nfreeing and individual as site specific\ntheatre. The ability to take part in a\nwork and be surrounded by it, has\nan effect on people that observing a\nwork from afar cannot match. This\nis the brilliance and skill of Tristan\u2019s\ncreations. The designer of these\nwonderful worlds,Tristan has found\nhimself a niche in which all aspects\nof the creative process can come\ntogether and form something larger\nand more impressive. Although\nsite specific theatre can fly under\nthe radar, the quality and joy of\nwork like Tristan\u2019s should not be\nunderstated.\nWith his dream to be an artist\nhalted by his inability to draw,\nTristan\u2019s early love for art and\narchitecture fuelled a move into\nthe theatre. Founding a theatre\ncompany after college, Tristan\nspent a number of years acting and\ndirecting on the fringe. By the mid\n90\u2019s, Tristan had found himself\nwith a group of people all kicking\ntheir heels as to what to do. Given\nthe opportunity to create a piece\nusing a whole theatre, not just the\nclassic black box studio we\u2019re used\nto, Tristan seized on a radically\ndifferent style of theatre. All the\nlittle areas around started to interest\nTristan \u2013 the woodland around the\ntheatre, the windows looking out\non that woodland, the backstage\nareas and the little garden the\npublic would never otherwise see.\nThe result of this experience wasn\u2019t\nexactly the beginning of Tristan\u2019s\nsteps into site specific theatre, but\nthe culmination of all the artistic\nendeavours he\u2019d always really loved\nand had never been able to connect\ntogether.\nWith a clear direction and\nfresh inspiration to create art in\nspaces with no connection to the\ntheatrical context, Tristan founded\ndreamthinkspeak and has been\nmaking thought provoking, unique\nwork ever since. Having dreamed\nup work in a Moscow paper factory\nand reimagining an underground\nabattoir in Clerkenwell, the scope\nof Tristan\u2019s work is staggering. Part\nof the joy of experiencing Tristan\u2019s\nwork is how little feels forced upon\nthe audience. From collecting\ntickets at the venue to having a\ndrink at the bar afterwards, there\nis an impressive consistency and a\ndedication to fitting each part of the\nsetting into the dreamscape Tristan\nhas generated. The transformation\nof Shoreditch Town Hall from\narts venue to hotel for Absent\nis all encompassing and wholly\nconvincing.\nSpeaking to Tristan about the\ncreative process, there is a unique\nthoughtfulness in how he describes\nhis relationship with different\ndiverse venues. Rather than\ncreating a work and placing it in a\nvenue, Tristan dedicates himself to\ndreaming in a space and allowing his\nwork to naturally slip into its chosen\nlocation.Progressing into the details\nof the piece, the space develops in\na way few other practitioners have\nconsideration for. In a solitary, time\nconsuming process, Tristan inhabits\nhis chosen building with a specific\nidea and allows the building to\ndefine the detail to a piece.\nOf course, the ideal venue isn\u2019t\nalwaysavailabletodreamthinkspeak.\nWith a number of ideas at any one\ntime, it is a testament to Tristan\u2019s\nartform that he is able to hold off\na project and keep it on the back\nburner until the time is right.\nAlthough I can\u2019t judge the suitability\nof previous chosen locations, my\nexperience at Absent suggests a\nparticularly refined patience. With\ndetail going into every little corner\nof Shoreditch Town Hall - the\nsigns, the reception, the bar and the\nlobby \u2013 it is hard to believe this isn\u2019t\nreally a hotel.\nBased on the life of the Duchess\nof Argyll,Tristan\u2019s initial inspiration\nfor Absent came from a small\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\ninstallation created for the Royal\nOpera House in 2009. A piece\nin response to Powder Her Face,\nthe opera by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, the\nDuchess of Argyll spent many\nyears in a central London hotel,\nextraordinarily because she had\nrun out of money. Blagging her\nway through her time at the hotel\nand living on credit, Tristan has\nfictionally extrapolated her story\nto describe a young girl moving to\nthe hotel in the 1950\u2019s and being\nevicted in the present day. A view\nless into the individual and more\ninto the development of the hotel\nand how it mirrors the increasingly\nglobalised and homogenised world\nwe live in. Tristan\u2019s criticism of\ncorporate power is obvious, but it\nis impressive that he has created a\nwork which doesn\u2019t obnoxiously\nMax speaks to the artistic director of dreamthinkspeak, the critically acclaimed company\nrevolutionising site specific theatre\nTristan Sharps Photo Credit: dreamthinkspeak\nMICE-IS:Too DangerousTo Display\nF\nar away, in the land of\nSylvania, all woodland\nanimals have overcome\ntheir differences to live in\nharmonious peace and tranquillity.\nUntil Now.Thus reads the catalogue\nnote on Isis Threaten Sylvania, a\nseries of tableaux by artist Mimsy.\nThe work features scenes of\nfuzzy toy woodland creatures in\nidyllic anthropomorphic scenes of\nclassrooms and beaches.Just beyond\nthe windows or over hills lurk\n\u2018MICE-IS\u2019, black clad Sylvanians\nin balaclavas, a pun-filled reference\nto the terror group ISIS.\nThe artwork is surreal enough\nalready; the circumstances under\nwhich they came not to be exhibited\nare so surreal as to beggar belief. It\nwas to form part of the Passion\nfor Freedom exhibition in the\nMall Galleries a couple of week\nago. Passion for Freedom is a\nnot-for-profit organisation which\nclaims to \u201ccreate space for artists\nand writers who discuss subjects\nomitted in politically correct circles\u201d\nand \u201cinvite people to open and\nuninhibited discussion\u201d. When\nthe police claimed that the art\nwas too inflammatory and would\ncost an extra \u00a336 000 in security,\nPassion for Freedom decided not\nto show the piece. You know it\u2019s\ntime to worry when a pro-freedom\nof expression organisation starts\ncensoring art. Passion for Freedom\nare far from alone, over the summer,\nthe National Youth Theatre pulled\nout of staging Homegrown a play\nexploring the paths that lead young\nBritons to become fundamentalists.\nIn the case of Homegrown, the\nNational Youth Theatre pulled the\nperformance after 10 days, citing an\nissue with quality.The writers of the\nplay made it clear that they thought\ntheir voices had been silenced. The\nshort run was plagued by last minute\nchanges.The site specific production\nwas forced to change venue when the\nTower Hamlets council expressed it\nwould be \u2018insensitive\u2019 to stage the\nperformance at a school close to the\none in Bethnal Green from which\nschoolgirls flew to Syria. In August,\nseveral signatories, including Anish\nKapoor and Liberty director Shami\nChakrabarti, wrote a letter to the\nNational Youth Theatre expressing\ntheir worry that the theatre had\nbeen put under pressure to cancel\nthe production.\nSafety of the artists and the public\nshould of course be of paramount\nimportance, however, galleries and\norganisations curating exhibitions\nshould not be so quick to err on\nthe side of caution. Censorship\nonly serves to shut down discussion\nabout important issues that artwork,\nsuch as that by Mimsy, provokes.\nAfter months of watching the\nhighlighted work was humorously\nmocking the despised terrorist\norganisation that causes suffering\nto many, not only in the Middle\nEast, but also here, in Europe and\nthe America\u201d. The artist, Mimsy,\nwho has adopted this pseudonym to\nprotect her family, is surely acutely\naware of the costs of exercising the\nfreedom of expression. To dismiss\nher work as being flippant would be\na mistake. Isis Threaten Sylvania is\na poignant and ultimately chilling\nsatire that mocks the innocence,\nand false safety that we live with\nin the West. The scenes of girls in\nschoolrooms and toy sunbathing\non beaches which were created\nbetween December 2014 and May\n2015 have since then tragically\nplayed out in the real world, first\nwith the kidnapping of schoolgirls\nin Nigeria, and then on the beaches\nof Tunisia.\nThe opposition to Charlie Hebdo\nreceiving the freedom of expression\naward from the American\nassociation of Poets, Essayists and\nNovelists (PEN) highlights the\ndifficulty inherent in discussing\nfreedom of expression issues. Those\nwho thought Charlie Hebdo should\nnot have received the PEN award\ncited that condemning the violence\nperpetrated against them was one\nthing, actively celebrating cartoons\ndesigned to be inflammatory was\nquite another. It can be a difficult\nand often emotive line to negotiate\nwhen self-censorship arises\nfrom a desire to offend religious\northodoxies and other cultures.\nChoosing not to celebrate the artists\nand writers who bravely create work\nthey know will put their lives at risk\nslowly erodes the freedom we all\nhave.It draws the line a little tighter\naround the things we are allowed\nto say or allowed to think, it feeds\nthe environment of fear we live in.\nSpeaking eloquently on the topic,\nMichael Attenborough, the artistic\ndirector at the Almeida Theatre\nsaid \u201cthe conscience and the soul\nof the country consist within the\nartistic community of this country,\u201d\nadding \u201conce we compromise that,\nwe compromise something very\nserious.\u201d\nUnfortunately, self-censorship in\nthe arts is becoming an increasingly\ncommon issue in Britain. In 2014,\nExhibit B, a show which aimed\nto recreate the \u2018human zoo\u2019, a\n19th\ncentury phenomenon, using\nblack actors was closed because\nof protests. Jude Kelly, artistic\ndirector of the Southbank Centre\nhas said that there is reluctance\namongst the powers that be within\nartistic institutions to put on\npolitically challenging productions.\nInstitutions such the National\nYouth Theatre and others prefer to\nerr on the side of caution and play\nit politically safe rather than risk\nlosing in funding from the state.\nSelf-censorship is a slippery slope.\nThe more that institutions veto\nproductions to avoid controversy,\nthe blander the work will become.\nSociety as a whole, not just the art\nworld, will be poorer and less free\nfor it. We may not always agree\nwith what an artist has to say, but\nit is important that we defend their\nright to say it, otherwise we can\nhardly complain if we are silenced\nin the future.\nPassion for Freedom and other\norganisations aiming to uphold\nthe right to freedom of expression\nshould do so wholeheartedly,\nwithout fear. The state has a role\nto play, in order to make sure that\nour rights to freedom of expression\ndo not slip away. The police should\nwork to supporting organisations\ncreating thought provoking and\ncontroversial work,not discouraging\nthem with financial burdens.\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nCensorship reaches new levels; artwork featuring Sylvanian toys dressed in black\nrobes removed from exhibition after being considered a security threat\nMICE-IS threaten to spoil a picnic.. Photo Credit: Mimsy\nYou know\nit\u2019s time\nto worry\nwhen a pro-freedom of\nexpression\norganisation\nstarts\ncensoring\nart\natrocities occurring across the\nworld, the magnitude of what is\nhappening can become too large\nto fully comprehend. When these\nevents go on for years, even the\nreporters leave, it is simply not news\nanymore. We need the jarring and\nslightly ludicrous juxtaposition of\ntoy pandas, bears, and rabbits in tiny\nhandstiched school uniforms who\nsitting at the desk,with the threat of\nunlikely terror just outside. It brings\nback the issues to the forefront and\nreminds us exactly what is at stake.\nThe curators of the Passion for\nFreedom event have argued that\u201cthe\nIsis\nThreaten\nSylvania is\na chilling\nsatire that\nmocks the\nfalse safety\nthat we live\nwith in the\nWest\nPart of the joy\nis how little\nfeels forced\nupon the\naudience\nforce this point.\nThe result of the endless\noverthinking of personal\nobsessions, the work on display\nis evidently that of a wonderfully\ndedicated artist. Never satisfied\nwith his own work and constantly\ntweaking current creations,Tristan\nshows continuous ambition but\nwith great modesty. Turning every\npound of funding into five,Tristan\nacknowledges the difficulty of\nachieving huge artistic dreams\non a finite budget, but inherently,\nTristan lives to create.

Although Imperial\nHub did not receive any funding\nfrom the union, and had not sought\nany, a union trustee board agenda\nmakes the point that there was a\npercieved \u201crisk related to Student\nHubs attempting to raise funds\nfrom College Resources\u201d.\nImperial Hub continues to make\nthe point that students were not\nconsulted on the decision.The union\nsays that after discussion between\n\u201cunion management and officer\ntrustees [i.e. sabbatical officers] the\nview was taken that the partnership\nshould come to an end as the\nintentions of Student Hubs were\nbecoming clearer\u201d. Members of\nthe Trustee Board were \u201cnot asked\nformally to approve this decision\nbut all responses were supportive\u201d.\nThe union\u2019s Trustee Board is\nmade up of an appointed chair,\ncurrently a professor at the college,\nfive student trustees, lay trustees\nand every sabbatical officer bar the\nFELIX Editor (who take a year out\nof their studies and are paid by the\nunion). The Trustee Board is legally\nresponsible for the union.\nThe hub\u2019s central office employed\na member of staff to coordinate\ntheir activities at Imperial and the\nhub\u2019s statement says the decision\nhas the potential to cause three\nredundencies.\nAt least one Imperial Hub staff\nmember was was given office\nspace in the union building, and\nsociety level privileges for room\nbooking within it. With this, the\nunion was able to include Imperial\nHub\u2019s successes in its reports on\nvolunteering, since the hub was a\npartner of Imperial College Union.\nImperial Hub elected a 2015/16\ncommitteelastacademicyear,asthey\nhad no idea their future partnership\nwith the union was under threat. In\nan official statement released by the\nhub, they said that the union had\n\u201cmade it as difficult as possible for\nthe student committee to continue\u201d\nand have\u201crefused to have discussions\nabout considering them as a student\nsociety, and have offered support\nonly if the committee no longer\nworks with Imperial Hub\u201d.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Fair, the\ncommittee were not allowed a\nstand, posters or banners, and were\ninstructed by the union not to\nwear their Imperial hub branded\nclothing. Some of their flyers were\ntaken away by union staff, but they\nstill managed to get four hundred\nsign ups.\nIn an open letter to the president\nof the union and several union staff\nmembers, the President of the hub,\nDaniel Chipchase, described how\nthe union had left the hub members\nfeeling \u201cbetrayed and undervalued\u201d.\nThe agreement between Imperial\nHub and the union has been official\nsince 2011, and was formalised by\na Memorandum of Understanding\nbetween the two parties, essentially\nagreeing on the terms of their\npartnership. In July, the union\nsought to add a clause stopping\nImperial Hub from applying to the\nCollege for any funding. The union\nsaid it attempted to \u201csoften the\ntone\u201d of this new clause by asking\nthat Imperial Hub \u201cconsult and\nagree with [the union] any proposed\nagreements with college\u201d.\nThe union went on to say that\nwhile these negotiations were\ngoing on, Imperial Hub had \u201cbeen\napproaching senior college staff...for\ndirect support for their activities\u201d,\nwhich they found out after being\n\u201ccopied into an email response\nto [Imperial Hub] from the Vice\nProvost (Education)\u201d. Imperial\nHub\u2019s statement disagrees, saying\nthat these meetings were arranged\nby the student committee to\ncelebrate their achievements and\nraise awareness with college, rather\nthan ask for funding. At a meeting\nwith Alice Gast, the president of\nthe college, Imperial Hub said it\nwas \u201cinvited\u201d to bring a proposal\nto college, which would include a\nrequest for funding.\nThe union said it knew the\ncentral hub charity had been set a\nfundraising target of \u00a3135k, and\nthe union\u2019s worry seemed to be\nthat the hub would attempt to\nraise this from College, presumably\njeopardising the union\u2019s own\nfunding applications. Imperial Hub\nmaintains this figure was taken \u201cout\nof context\u201d and would not all have\nbeen requested from the college.\nThe union currently employs two\nmembers of staff in its Student\nDevelopment department. It\u2019s no\nsecret that they\u2019re looking to hire\ntwo new recruits in this sector, but\nImperial Hubs protests this. In a\nstatement seen by FELIX, Hubs\nwonders why the union didn\u2019t invest\nthe money they had for these new\nstaff members into Imperial Hub\ngiven its \u201cproven track record\u201d.\nIn the same statement from Hubs,\nwhich contests several points in\nthe union\u2019s Trustee Board agenda\n(which is freely available online,\nalbeit deep within the throngs of\nthe website), Hubs say that the\nunion \u201cspoke to partners about\nAt Freshers\u2019\nFair, the\ncommittee\nwere\ninstructed\nby the union\nnot wear\ntheir Imperial\nHub branded\nclothing\nterminating the partnership before\nthey had even notified [us]\u201d.\nDominic Falcao, of Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Create Lab, wrote an\nopen letter expressing dismay at the\ndecision.\u201cFor the meantime,I chose\nto ignore your decision,\u201d he said,\n\u201cI will continue to send Imperial\nstudents to Imperial Hub\u201d.\nIt\u2019s too early to tell what this\ndecision will mean for Imperial\nHub, its volunteers and the projects\nits been working on.

An odd mix between the classically stereotyped Oxbridge elite and a young shaky political\nsmart arse. Wickedly funny with a biting political repertoire, Shah\u2019s material is rarely easy watching but some\nof the sharpest, wittiest and most current comedy on the scene. Some will hate Shah\u2019s work, but if you can bare\nthe intensity of his set you\u2019ll be in tears by the end of the hour.\nStaging a Revolution (Young Vic, 2nd\n- 14th\nNovember)\nA series of ten productions over two weeks, the critically acclaimed Belarus Free Theatre present a collection of\ncontroversial works on the theme of revolution. Banned in their own country, the production moves each night\nperforming at undisclosed locations and at the Young Vic. The viewer is subject to the fear and bravery that\ngoes into consuming and creating art under a totalitarian regime. Ranging from discussions on hacking and\nsurveillance state to two nights of King Lear,BFT display a breadth and a creative courage rarely seen on stage.\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses (Donmar, 11th\nDecember \u2013 13th\nFebruary)\nLike every production at the Donmar, Les Liaisons Dangereuses is sold out two months before opening night.\nWith the feisty Dominic West taking up the lead role, it is unlikely that he lives up to John Malkovich\u2019s\nlightning performance in the 1988 film, but the play oozes enough sex, sass and wit for West to work with. I\nhave little doubt that this production will be extraordinary. Day tickets are available but getting them can be a\npain. For those of us with better things to do, NT Live will show the production on January 28th\n.\nFrank Auerbach (Tate Britain, 9th\nOctober \u2013 15th\nMarch 2016)\nFrank Auerbach is considered by some to be one of Britain\u2019s finest painters. He has worked a very narrow set of\nsubjects for many years, charting the change in the streets around his home in Camden Town over decades. He\nis notorious for simply painting over his previous works until the finished piece emerges. This exhibition is an\nopportunity to see the collected works of an artist who, along with Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon, has had a\nprofound impact on British art.\nCarmen (Royal Opera House, 19th\nOctober \u2013 30th\nNovember, ballet from 26th\nOctober \u2013 12th\nNovember)\nThis is the classic tragedy of Don Jose who sacrifices everything for Carmen, the woman he loves. When she\nleaves him for another man,his love turns to hatred.It has everything you could want from a blockbuster opera;\npassion, betrayal, a raucous Spanish atmosphere with unforgettable music to boot. For a two-week run, the\nROH will also be staging a dance adaptation of the classic Bizet opera by The Royal Ballet.\nThe Amazing World of MC Escher\n(Dulwich Picture Gallery, 14th\nOctober \u2013 17th\nJanuary)\nEscher\u2019s lithography and woodcuts, based on the work of leading mathematicians such as Roger Penrose are\nsurrealism at its most distilled. Whether you want to admire the mathematical concepts that underlie the art,\nor the brilliance of Escher\u2019s technique and imagination, this exhibition featuring nearly 100 of his drawings\nand prints spanning his career is not to be missed.\nWords that bridge cultures\nS\nituated merely a couple\nof minutes away from the\nhustle and bustle of Covent\nGarden, Betterton Street\nwith its petite shopfronts and\nrelative quiet seems like a world\naway.\nYet, almost every night, from a\nhumble unit along this street, words\nemerge, carried by the wind and\nheavy with emotion.\nIt is easy to miss the Poetry\nCaf\u00e9. Its nondescript shopfront is\nidentifiable only by a plain sign:\n\u201cThe Poetry Place\u201d, and the bright,\ncheery interior of the caf\u00e9 when one\npeers in. The glass front is plastered\nover with leaflets and posters\nadvertising poetry events all over\nLondon. It is small and cosy, a place\nwhere one might enjoy an afternoon\nwith a book and coffee.\nThe stairs to the basement open\ninto a small space; on one side there\nis an open area where poems are\nread and music played, on the other\na couple of rows of red plastic chairs\nfor the audience.\nIt is this basement that is the heart\nof activity, with different poetry\nevents happening all the time.These\ninclude open mic poetry readings,\n\u201cpoetry clinics\u201d, where established\npoets are invited to critique the\nworks of aspiring poets, poetry\nslams and even combined jazz and\npoetry performances.\nOn the first Monday of every\nmonth, the basement fills with\nthe voices of those who hail from\nforeign lands, the ones trying to\nfind their place in a land they still\nhesitate to call their own. These are\nthe members of Exiled Writers Ink,\na group of artists mostly living in\nexile in the UK and Europe, as well\nas the descendants of those who fled\ntheir countries.\nThe organisation was set up in\n2000 by Jennifer Langer, herself\nthe daughter of Holocaust survivors\nfrom Germany. It aims to support\nthe work of exiles, migrants\nand their descendants through\nperformance, publishing and\ntraining, encouraging integration in\nthe process.\nEach poetry reading is themed\n\u2013 this month, it was \u2018Daughters\nof Migrants\u2019, while the upcoming\nNovember reading is themed\n\u201cWriting out of War and Exile\u201d.\nOften, they are opened with music\nby the gypsy music group Le\nGazhikane Muzikante, a longitme\ncollaborator of Exiled Writers Ink.\nThis month, they performed music\nform the Jewish community of 15th\ncentury Spain,in the spirit of poetry\nby the daughters of Jewish migrants.\nIt is often said that art is universal,\nand its appreciation is common\nacross cultures.Of the audience who\nwent to hear the October poetry\nreading, only a handful were exiles\nthemselves. Some were third, fourth\ngeneration migrants, on all accounts\nborn and bred British,but interested\nin their own ancestry and how their\nforefathers must have felt, having\nleft their homes for unfamilar\nland. Others were interested in aid\nwork. There were poetry enthusiasts\nand even some tourists who had\nhappened to pass by.\nYet, the words of the poets were\nrelatable to anyone \u2013 it is fair to\nsay that everyone has felt some\ndisplacement at some point in their\nlives, whether it is a child not fitting\nin at school or an adult moving into\nanother city for work.\nAviva Dautch, one of the poets\nreading on the night, brought\nup the concept of a \u201charmonious\ndiscord\u201d, which she raised as the\ncommon experience of any migrant.\nAs a foreigner among people who\nare different to yourself but largely\nsimilar to each other, there is both\nan unwillingness to completely\nchange yourself to fit in, and the\nphysical impossibility of doing so.\nThe best solution,then,is a positive\nintegration of your differences\ninto the fabric of the community.\nDiscord is not always unpleasant \u2013\nin fact, it can sometimes add colour\nand excitement into our lives.\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nFamily relationships and vignettes\nof childhood seemed to be a popular\ntheme of the night. Perhaps, when\nour physical surroundings keep\nchanging, we identify \u201chome\u201d\nintangibly - it is our most important\nrelationships and our fondest\nmemories.\nHaving grown up outside of the\nUK myself, one of the poems I hold\nclose to my heart is Originally by\nCarol Ann Duffy:\nDo I only think\nI lost a river, culture, speech, sense of\nfirst space\nand the right place? Now, Where do\nyou come from?\nstrangers ask. Originally? And I\nhesitate.\nDisplacement has always been\na favourite theme of poets, and\nlanguage especially is a recurring\nmotif. Linda Black, another poet of\nthe night, described the confusion\nwith the pronunciation of her\ngrandfather\u2019s family name when\nhe moved. Language is probably\none of the first things that reveal\none\u2019s foreign origins, and one of the\nfirst obstacles that a new migrant\nhas to overcome. Language is also\na connection to one\u2019s roots. In the\nwords of Ms Dautch:\n\u201cWe brush off dust, but who can brush\noff pain in Hebrew?\u201d\nBeing a third generation Jewish\nmigrant, she questions the extent\nto which we can shed the history\nof our people even as we seem to\nThe Poetry Cafe is the perfect stop for a light dose of poetry - this month, we cover a\ngroup of writers who discuss their experiences transitioning between cultures.\nThe Poetry Cafe. Photo Credit: The Poetry Society Exiled Lit Cafe. Photo Credit: Exiled Writers Ink\nIt is often said\nthat art is\nuniversal, and\nits appreciation\nis common\nacross cultures\nso easily morph everything else to\nfit into our adopted homes. \u201cHow\nis that possible,\u201d she asks, \u201cwhen\nthe root of the sound of my name\nis Hebrew?\u201d\nEven as these poets write of the\nsearch for a coherent identity and\na sense of belonging, their words\nhave crossed cultures and shared\ntheir personal struggles with the\nrest of the world. This, I feel, is the\nbeauty of words and art \u2013 both as\nan articulation of emotion and a\nforce for a common understanding.\nWithin the theme of exile literature,\nthen, the words of the dispossessed,\nespecially those of the newly settled\nmigrants,is as important as a tool for\nintegration and understanding as it\nis a way of dealing with the complex\nemotions of such a displacement.\nDiscord is\nnot always\nunpleasant \u2013\nin fact, it can\nsometimes\nadd colour and\nexcitement\ninto our lives\nWith the refugee crisis constantly\non the news and spilling right onto\nour doorstep, it is not enough to\nonly be thinking about the logistics\nand politics of where and how the\nrefugees should be distributed. It is\nperhaps worth thinking about how\nour societies can integrate those\nthat eventually settle in kind ways \u2013\nExiled Writers Ink, for example, are\nmaking a trip to the Calais refugee\ncamp to bring them books, poetry\nand company. Migration, after\nall, has been a fixture throughout\nhistory and we are living in the\nresulting richness and diversity that\nmakes the world so interesting \u2013 and\nof course, enjoying the whole genre\nof literature that human migration\nhas inspired.\n\n"

Hangman doesn\u2019t\nmuch care for tradition, but here we\ngo anyway.\nSo. Hangman made the mistake\nof going to the Freshers Mingle last\nweekend.\nWe didn\u2019t mean to. We were just\ntrying to get this page done early\nand we got trapped by hundreds of\nfreshers. Hundreds, we tell you.\nMaybe not hundreds. We\u2019re not\nreally sure. All we saw was a bunch\nof drunk, gropey people in our way.\nHangman would apologise if you\nwere one of the freshers we pushed,\nshoved, growled at or generally\nlooked at with a withering glare,\nbut we\u2019re not sorry. Hangman has\nno time for regrets.\nAll this (necessary) violence\nagainst those new to Imperial got\nHangman thinking: how, after the\nsweaty, alcohol-infused buzz of\nthe first few weeks of university,\ndoes anyone survive the crushing\nboredom and pressure of doing an\nactual degree?\nHangman would have asked other\nstudents what helped them make\nit through the year, but that would\nhave been too much like actual\njournalism.\nWe\u2019ll have none of that in the\nHangman section, thank you very\nmuch.\nInstead, we just made some\nobservations about life, safe in our\ncave under the West Basement.\nAnd because Hangman bloody\nloves listicles (\u201clove \u2018em, can\u2019t get\nenough of the things,\u201d said no-one\never), here is one of those. About\nwhatever we were just talking about.\nDrinking\nHangman has noticed an awful\nlot of people spending time in the\nUnion. The only possible reason for\nthis must be the relatively cheap\nalcohol (only one arm and half a leg,\ncompared to most London pubs\u2019\nmultiple-limbs-per-pint pricing\nstructure), and the ability/need\nto consume large quantities of it.\nHangman can think of no other\nreason to come to this godforsaken\nplace.\nTV\n\u2018Netflix and chill\u2019 is the latest\npiece of nonsense that has wormed\nits way onto Twitter/Tumblr/Social\nNetwork 7 - yes, Hangman uses\nsocial media. We\u2019re not a bunch of\ncave men. Although we do live in a\ncave.\nApparently people enjoy\nmindlessly staring at a screen as\nthe pictures on it change and noises\ncome out. This is what counts for\nentertainment now. What a world\nwe live in.\nDrinking\nWhile watching TV? Who knows.\nHangman doesn\u2019t.\nSocial Media\nBecause there\u2019s nothing quite\nlike the thrill of seeing what other\npeople are doing in their equally\npointless lives, but all from the\ncomfort of your own home/bed/\nsofa/cage without actually having to\ngo to the effort of doing those things\nor seeing those people yourself.\nBelieve it or not, Hangman is\nactually quite fond of social media,\nthanks to its suite of tools for\nignoring people (or just winding\nthem up).\nOur favourite is reading people\u2019s\nmessages, then deliberately not\nanswering.

If and when you console a\nmonster correctly you can spare\nthem \u2013 making an entirely pacifist\nplaythrough possible.There\u2019s still the\noption to fight, like in conventional\nJRPGs (which requires you to time\nyour key presses to deliver optimal\ndamage), but the game is most fun\nwhen you leave your foes uninjured.\nEven when you\u2019re being nice,\nmonsters will still fight back and\nyou\u2019ll have to dodge their attacks\nin a top down bullet hell style\nFrequent save points make the game a frustration-free experience. Photo Credit: Steam\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nTobyfox\u2019s debut delivers the\nmost subversive JRPG of the\ndecade so far\nEach monster design is impressively unique \u2013 it\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t catch \u2018em all. Photo Credit: Steam\nUnderTale\nhas one\nnoticeable\ndifference \u2013\nthe freedom\nto be\nmerciful\nmini-game where you control your\nheart as you avoid projectiles. Add\nin more enemies and this becomes\nincreasingly chaotic. Bosses add\ninteresting twists to this mechanic,\nproviding some of the game\u2019s\nmost memorable experiences.\nWhen you\u2019re not battling\nmonsters, you\u2019ll be solving\nenvironment based puzzles. These\nare easily the weakest part of the\ngame \u2013 they\u2019re wholly unoriginal\nand offer little challenge. In the\ncontext of the story they make\nsense but they quickly become\ntiresome and you\u2019ll wish there was\nan option to skip these sections.\nThe writing in UnderTale is\noften hilarious and at other times\nshockingly depressing. It\u2019s littered\nwith awful puns and self-aware\njibes aimed at the JRPG genre.\nThe dialogue in battle and whilst\nexploring the underground is just\none part of the game\u2019s fantastic\ncharacterisation; lo-fi sprites\nreminiscent of Earthbound or\nMother 3 (and the SNES-era in\ngeneral) create characters that are\nimpressively diverse and unique.\nTumblr is already full of fan-art\ngiving testament to the popularity\nand originality of these designs.The\ndifferent colour palettes throughout\neach of the game\u2019s environments\nare matched perfectly with the epic\nand haunting soundtrack. Toby Fox\nhas composed music for popular\nwebcomic Homestuck (along with\na number of other projects) in the\npast and his experience shows\nhere. Catchy chiptune tracks\nare mixed with expertly layered\nsampled instruments. At times,\nthis mish-mash of genres feels\njarring but the consistent quality\nand originality of the compositions\nmakes this one of the year\u2019s\nbest videogame soundtracks.\nRecently there has been a trend\nof superficial choices in games.\nSave one character and let another\ndie or say something that might\noffend an NPC and they\u2019ll hold\nthat against you forever. In most of\nthese situations the outcome at the\nend is still the same and there\u2019s very\nlittle emotion behind the decisions\nthat you make. UnderTale feels\ndifferent, not only in the way that\nit forces you to make decisions\nso often but also in how essential\nthese decisions are to its themes and\nmechanics. You can kill everyone\nin the underworld or spare every\nmonster you come across and\nyour experience will be drastically\ndifferent. Ultimately, UnderTale\nmakes the statement that there is\nanother way: not all battles can or\nneed to be resolved with violence.\nIt recognises that understanding\nand compassion are essential if\nwe truly wish to resolve conflicts\n\u2013 a message that is all too obvious\nand yet so commonly ignored.\nUnderTale, by tobyfox, is available\nnow on Steam.\nChiptune\ntracks are\nmixed with\nexpertly\nlayered\nsampled\ninstruments\n\n"

If Imperial\nfeels male dominated now, imagine\nwhat it was like then.\nPorter was already a fellow of the\nRoyal Society when she got the\njob. The research group she headed\nup at Imperial was one of the first\nfew to use chromatography to study\nmetabolism in plants.\nAn analyst from the IT\ndepartment, Kay Barrett, won the\ncompetition.On choosing the name,\nshe said that Helen \u201creally stood\nout\u201d and that \u201cas a woman working\nin the technology sector, I thought\nit was important to recognise the\ncontribution women have made to\nscience throughout history\u201d.\nThe supercomputer\u2019s rebrand\ncoincides with its recent upgrade.\nOpening up the naming process to\nthecollegecommunityhasreminded\neveryone that Imperial does in fact\nhave several supercomputers, and\nthat they are available to Imperial\nacademics to test their models\nbefore asking for time with other\nmore powerful computers.\nThe supercomputer, formerly\nknown as CX2, has just been given\nmore memory,with the competition\nbeing launched in celebration.\nThis high powered computer is\nused to generate big data, analyse\nmultifaceted models and predict the\noutcomes of complex mechanical,\nmedical and structural set ups.\nAfter retiring from her post\nat Imperial in 1964, Professor\nPorter went on to the Agricultural\nResearch Council. This Helen joined Imperial in 1959.

Photo Credit: amsat-uk.org\nDr Sherman\nwas the first\nBriton in\nspace, and\nremains the\nonly one\nReal life astronaut to join Imperial staff\nT\nhis week, Imperial\nannounced the\nappointment of a new\nOperations Manager\nin the Chemistry department, who\nhappens to have been to space.\nIn the late 80s,Dr Helen Sherman\nwas working for the confectionary\ncompany, Mars, when she heard a\nradio advert appealing for wannabe\nspace explorers. By 1991, she was\naboard the Mir space station,\nconducting experiments with\nRussian cosmonauts.\nDr Sherman was the first\nBriton in space, and remains the\nonly one, since all other British\nastronauts have had to change their\ncitizenship, and make the trip under\nthe American flag. She is likely to\nremain the only British woman\nto do so for a while longer, since\nthe European Space Agency has\nchosen a male helicopter test pilot\nas the next British recruit to be\ntrained as an astronaut.\nNow Dr Sharman will be\ndealing with chemists at Imperial.\nAlthough the role is managerial,\nshe told college in an interview on\ntheir website that, \u201cthe fact that I\nenjoy chemistry means I just feel\nright having a home in a chemistry\ndepartment\u201d.\nAfter returning from space,\nSharman focussed on science\noutreach, doing talks on her\nexperiences of space travel. She\nwas recently awarded a science\noutreach prize from the British\nScience Association. With David\nNutt, the Imperial academic sacked\nas a government advisor for saying\nthat ecstacy was less dangerous than\nriding a horse, returning to do a\nHorizons lecture, could Imperial\nbe banking on their new resident\nastronaut to do a few talks herself?\nThe trip that blasted Dr Sharman\nto fame, and space, was a joint\nventure by British companies and\nthe Soviet government. When\nBritish firms didn\u2019t have the\nfinances to complete the project,\nand the British government would\nnot invest, Russia made up the rest\nof the money.\nDr Sharman has spoken out on\nthe British government\u2019s reluctance\nto spend on space flight, saying that\nthere are long term gains. In a 2009\ninterview with The Telegraph, she\nsaid that space flight gives people\n\u201cthe feeling that Britain is not\ngetting left behind when it comes to\ntechnology and worldwide status\u201d.\nThis sounds pretty Imperial to us.\nHaving worked for a chocolate\ncompany and then going on to be\nan astronaut, Helen Sharman now\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\nadds Imperial to her enviable CV.\nThe former chemist was born\nin Yorkshire, went to space and\nnow works for the College\nIt was\nimportant to\nrecognise the\ncontribution\nwomen have\nmade to\nscience\u201d\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

It combined\nblack metal and shoegaze (call it\nblackgaze if you wish) in a way few\nhad dared to do before, introducing\na once inaccessible genre to\nthousands of new listeners.\nThe cover of New Bermuda\nstands out in stark contrast to its\npredecessor; gone is the warm pink\nof Sunbather now replaced by dark\nuneven strokes.
