    "content": "22 FRIDAY 08 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMichael Fassbender (12 Years a Slave)\nIt\u2019s a shocking but true fact that Michael Fassbender has never been nominated for an Oscar. Ever. Not even\nfor Shame. That\u2019s right. So this really\nshould be his year to shine...right? His\nruthless, pure-evil, malicious interpretation of the worst slave owner\nyou\u2019ll ever come across is frighteningly convincing, and his unhinged\nperformance is compelling through-out. Once again, his performance isn\u2019t\nsomething you\u2019d feel comfortable sitting through to watch, but even that\ntaboo subject of slavery shouldn\u2019t deter a nomination at this year\u2019s race.\nBarkhad Abdi (Captain Phillips)\nEveryone thought they would be impressed by Tom Hanks. And they\nwere. But making an even bigger\nimpact in this thriller that finds an\nAmerican container ship boarded by\narmed Somalian pirates was Barkhad\nAbdi, a first-time actor. It\u2019s the deadly\nintensity in his eyes that scares at first,\nbut it\u2019s also the surprisingly humane\nside to his lead pirate character that\nhe brings out that paints an interesting aspect of his role that could have\nbeen simpler and dumbed down. Abdi\nshould definitely brace himself for a\nwhole horde of nominations.\nJared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club)\nPlaying a transgender character is\nno easy job for any actor, but word\nis, Jared Leto (who lost 30 pounds\nfor the role) gives quite the sensational performance of this year. He\nwas awarded the Breakthrough Actor\nAward at the Hollywood Film Awards\n(perhaps slightly insulting given how\nlong he\u2019s been successfully around in\nthe industry), but an Oscar campaign\nmust surely be well underway. She\u2019s a\nseemingly street-smart, HIV-positive\nprostitute, although she too must have\na story or two to tell given her actual\nvulnerability and insecurity.\nTom Hanks (Saving Mr Banks)\nThe film marks the first time Walt\nDisney has ever been played on the big\nscreens. And who better to play such\nan icon than Tom Hanks, who shows\nhe\u2019s not only good at saving Private\nRyan but also Mr Banks in an attempt\nto bring Mary Poppins the novel to\nthe movie theatres? As Walt, he is the\nfriendliest boss you\u2019ll ever find on this\nplanet, and as his easy-going American way clashes with the more traditional and uptight English methods of\nMrs Travers, the book\u2019s author, much\nhilarity ensues, with Hanks being an\nintegral part of the pair.\nDecember is just around the corner,\nand film studios are lining up their\ncritically-lauded films to take part\nin this year\u2019s much-anticipated Oscar race. As with any year, there are\nstrong contenders in every field and\nit\u2019s certainly too early to be betting on\na winner.\nSo over the next few weeks, Felix\nFilm will be giving you a breakdown of\nthe actors, actresses and films that will\nbe grabbing the headlines in the near\nfuture; but this is in no way a definitive\nlist, as some of the films haven\u2019t even\nbeen released over here yet.\nThis week in our feature is the Best\nSupporting Actor category.\nReady...\nSteady...\nGo!\n2014 at the Oscars: B\n\n"

Strong\npublic scepticism has been fuelled by\nthe parade of paraphernalia arriving\nfrom the USA. Images ranging from\nflaming taps right through to ominous\n\u2018frack pads\u2019 litter the internet. In the\nsummer of 2013 protestors took\nto the streets at the G8 Summit in\nFermanagh. Balcombe became the\nfocal point in the notorious Cuadrilla\nrow, exhibiting some of the most\nvitriolic resistance.\nWhile there may be fundamental\nethical and environmental questions\nto be addressed in context of the\nwider fracking debate the sporadic\nsensationalism of many individuals\nand parties ought to be condemned.\nCredence must also be conceded to\nempirical analyses and research into\nthe practice.\nIt must be highlighted that the\nprocess of hydraulic fracturing\nhas been carried out on a number\nof occasions prior to the 2011\nBlackpool \u2018Earthquake\u2019. Nodding\ndonkeys (remnant equipment from\nfracking processes) pepper the fields\nsurrounding the Gainsborough\nand Beckenham communities.\nFracking has been carried out as far\nback as 1969. It must be noted that\ncontroversial \u2018shale\u2019 fracking did not\ntake place in this instance. In spite\nof this, the case study highlights the\ndangers associated with the selective\nimplementation of statistics employed\nby certain media outlets. This\ncreates an exploitative smokescreen,\nespecially on internet search engines,\nthus masking the truth by crowding\nit in skewed hysteria. Public opinion\nis confined to a fabricated status quo\nand the problem becomes a self-exciting perpetuity.\nThe UK debate can be realigned\nthrough the clarified efforts of\nscience communication. A 2013 BBC\ndocumentary entitled \u2018Fracking: The\nNew Energy Rush\u2019 and presented\nby Professor Iain Stewart of the\nUniversity of Plymouth demonstrated\nthat the fracking debate, despite the\nschism in public opinion, contains\nmany other dimensions that could\nshift the balance of debate to the\nunderlying science. The documentary\ndrew inferences from the USA.\nStates like North Dakota typify\nexponential growth in the fracking\nindustry. It has provided the country\nwithanunprecedentedsenseof\u2018energy\nsecurity\u2019 through a liberal supply of\ndomestic gas. It has boosted exports\nof American coal. The other side of\nthe phenomenon is the myriad of\nconstruction, deforestation, increased\nemissions and noise pollution. The\ncrux of American opposition centres\non civilian health within areas of\nindustrial development. Many also\nquestion the consequences for the\nwater table, the integrity of agriculture\nand biodiversity.\nIt is clear that the priorities of\nthe American fracking industry\ncluster around the economics (Many\nmiddle men and landowners have\naccumulated small fortunes) . The\nindustry has developed without\nsufficient regulation. One might infer\nthat the physical process of hydraulic\nfracturing is misconstrued as the evil\nentity. In actuality it is the supporting\nframework of policy, business and\ncommercialism that generates the\nimperfection.\nThe UK could learn from these\nmistakes. First and foremost,\nthe process of fracking requires\nexceptionallyhighpressurestofracture\nrock. By its very nature it demands\ndiligence, focus and time. A mediated,\nreduced rate of production from shale\nfracking could minimise unnecessary\ndamage to surrounding bedrock and\nreduce the (still vague) environmental\nhazards. It could unify the disparity\nbetween pragmatism and economics\nby encouraging a more relaxed and\n(crucially) localised energy market.\nSecondly, this could engender an ethos\nof openness surrounding the practice.\nIn the United States many companies\nchampion injunctions, concealing the\ncomposition of their fracking fluids.\nWhile this is favourable for business in\ncontext of an aggressively competitive\nA\nt least 120 Tibetans\nhave set themselves\nalight in protest against\nChinese rule since\n2009. It\u2019s the only\npeaceful way they\u2019ve been able to\nbroadcast their recurrent message:\nSave Tibet. It seems that their message\nhas fallen on deaf ears. When you ask\nmost people what they know about\nTibet common answers would be \u201cit\u2019s\npart of China isn\u2019t it?\u201d, or \u201cit\u2019s where\nthe Dalai Lama lives\u2026\u201d Whilst the\nsecond answer is significantly wrong\nand the Dalai Lama has been in exile\nsince 1952 the first answer, though\ntechnically correct, completely\nundermines and puts into perspective\nTibet\u2019s efforts to fight peacefully for\nindependence for over 50 years.\nSo what is Tibet? Tibet is situated\nin the western part of China, on the\nTibetan plateau, encompassing \u00bc of\nChinese landmass which, including\ntraditional Tibetan provinces, have\nbeen gradually assimilated into the\nSichuan and Qinghai regions. Now\nknown as the Tibet Autonomous\nRegion (though it holds no real\nautonomy from Beijing) TAR has\na population of around 6 million\nTibetans and over 7 million Chinese\nwho, following occupation in 1952,\nhave been forcefully relocated to\nTibet, making Tibetans the minority\npopulation in their own land. Prior\nto its occupation it was a historically\nand politically independent country\nwith its own language, alphabet\n(both of which hold no similarities to\nChinese Mandarin), distinct culture\nand religion (Tibetan Buddhism).\nH.H. Dalai Lama is the spiritual and\npolitical head of Tibet,giving you an\nidea of the values that the Tibetan\nnation holds.\nIt is a nation that, due to its\npacifist policies, had no power to\nwithstand an occupation. It has a\nunique culture preserved within\nthe heights of the Himalaya and\nremained untouched until Chinese\noccupation. Ever since its days of\npeaceful Buddhist practice Tibet\u2019s\nsituation has gravely changed. Human\nrights have failed, Tibet\u2019s culture\nand religious practices have been\nheavily oppressed. Environmental\ndestruction as a consequence of\nburgeoning infastructure in Tibet\n(adhering to China\u2019s energy needs)\nare endangering Tibet\u2019s fragile\nenvironment. According to NGO\n\u2018Friends of Tibet\u2019 the ingidenous\npopulation has dramatically declined.\nMonasteries have been destroyed,\nespecially in Lhasa, obstructed by new\nbuildings, plastic palm trees (I kid you\nnot) and plans of an airport. Monks\nhave been imprisoned (the majority\nof Tibetan prisoners are monks) and\ntortured. The Tibetan flag has been\nbanned, possession of a photograph\nof the Dalai Lama lands you in prison\nand celebrating his birthday on a\nsacred mountain is not advised (as\ndemonstrated by 9th July 2013).\nHow has the rest of the world sat\nback whilst the most peaceful nation\nis slowly being eradicated? It has been\nstudents who have pushed for Tibet\u2019s\ncause in the West, more so than\npoliticians who have turned a blind\neye to human rights violations. On\nthe 22nd October, at the quadrennial\nUN Human right\u2019s review in Geneva,\n\u201cStudents for a Free Tibet\u201d managed\nto break through security and scaled\nscaffolding at the UN headquarters in\nGeneva with a banner saying: \u201cChina\nfails human rights - UN stand up for\nTibet\u201d. On Tuesday 5th November\nstudent activists protested at the\nIntercontinental Hotel in Westminster\nagainst Intercontinental\u2019s plans to\nbuild a 5000 room hotel in Lhasa.\nThe plans indirectly give licence to\nenergy market, it detracts from the\nintegrity of science and health policy.\nThe UK could learn from this. The\ncomposition of fracking fluids would\nneed to be disclosed, in line with\nthat of Government expenses and\nthe already established ethos of free\ninformation.\nToconclude,sciencecommunication\nmay prove to be the crucial and\nrestorative link in the chain of the\nfuture UK energy market. It can\nserve to show that fracking, while\na chief focus, must be considered\nwithin a cohesive approach to science,\neconomics and ethics. This may prove\nto be easier said than done.\nWhat does the Future Hold for Tibet?\nEoghan J. Totten\n@eoghantotten\nComment Editor\nmotherearthnews.com\nChinese plans of turning Tibet into\na commercialized concrete jungle.\nMultiple NGOs, united action and\ncontinuous protests land the Tibetan\u2019s\ncause in the headlines frequently.\nWhile unforeseeable in the near\nfuture, for Tibet to become truly\nautonomous, let alone independent, it\ndoes not seem a lost cause.\nOnce aware of Tibet\u2019s situation,\nI feel compelled to take action . If\nyou\u2019re interested in supporting Tibet,\nvisit www.studentsforafreetibet.org\nand like the Students for a free Tibet\nImperial College facebook page for\nregular updates.\nIt is a nation\nthat, due to its\npacifist policies,\nhad no power\nto withstand\noccupation.\nKamil\u0117 Padma Rudaviciute\nWriter\n\n"

The T-index\nis defined separately for each topic\nof interest. A high score is achieved\nwhen the user is well known and when\nthey have been tweeted often.\nIt is hoped the T-index will help\nadvertising companies, political\ngroups and digital agencies to\nascertain who the most influential\npeople are on social media.\nThe tool was launched by sharing\nthe \u201910 most influential tweeters\u2019 on\nfive different subjects. The analysis\nhas been done on topics such as\nManchester United and David\nCameron.\nThe team who created it would\nlike to expand the project so that\nany person can search who the most\ninfluential speakers are on any subject\nby themselves.\nThe Director of the Institute of\nGlobal Health Innovation at Imperial,\nProfessor Lord Ara Darzi, stated: \u201c\u2018We\nfirst became interested in measuring\ninfluence in social media during the\nrecent reforms in the health service,\nwhen it became clear that Twitter\nhad become an important forum\nfor discussions about the changes.\nWe wanted to find some way of\ndetermining how influential different\nindividuals were who were tweeting\nabout the reforms and published a\nresearch article detailing our findings.\n\u201cWe then realised this metric could\nbe more widely used across Twitter to\nmeasure key influencers in any topic\nfrom fashion brands, to public events\nto major geopolitical events. The\nresults we\u2019re getting from the topics\nwe\u2019ve analysed so far are fascinating,\nand certainly tell us more than existing\nmetrics of influence currently in use.\u201d\nDr Dominic King, a lecturer at\nImperial commented that \u201cThere\nare lots of companies that measure\ninfluence on Twitter, but they usually\ndon\u2019t tell you how they do it. They also\nfocus on the individual rather than a\ntopic.\u201d\n\u201cThe T-index is a simple, transparent\nscore that measures how influential\nsomeone is based on the quality and\nquantity of their output on a specific\nsubject. The method is open to\neveryone, so people can discuss how\nuseful it is as a metric.\n\u201cThe results show that bloggers\nand independent voices can have\ntheir messages disseminated to a\nwider audience than established\nnews providers. For tweets about\nDavid Cameron, Marcus Chown and\nChunky Mark have higher T-indexes\nthan established media providers like\nthe Guardian and Daily Mirror.\n\u201cWe also provide information on\nthe most popular tweets overall about\neach topic. These are almost always\nfrom celebrities such as Stephen\nFry, Lady Gaga or members of One\nDirection. But while one tweet about a\ntopic may stimulate a peak of interest,\nit\u2019s likely to be short-term. The T-index\nmeasures sustained influence.\u201d\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\nImperial\u2019s New\nTwitter Tool\n\n"

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 08 NOV\nCOMMENT\n\u201c\n\u201d\nI\nwas born in Kenya. I lived there\nuntil I was 10 years old. I learned\nto swear at someone in Kiswahili\nand Kikuyu. One of my fondest\nKenyan memories is my first ever\nlive cricket match at the Gymkhana\nStadium in Nairobi. It was the 2003\nWorld Cup and Sri Lanka were in\ntown. The gulf in class was enormous\nand yet we trounced them by 53 runs.\nIt really doesn\u2019t get better than that.\nSadly enough the fortunes of Kenya\nCricket (and I guess the entire country\nin 2007) have plummeted to some\npainful lows, mainly due to financial\nand personnel mismanagement.\nMy elder brother decided he wanted\nto study medicine. Since there was no\nway we could afford international fees\nmy mum, brother and I moved to the\nUK to try and get home-fees status.\nMy brother graduated as a doctor\nin 2009 and is now well on his way\nto becoming an anaesthetist. More\nimportantly he is now a father. It\nwould appear that the move has been\na good decision.\nHaving completed secondary\neducation here my interest in Kenya\nbecame passive. People in the UK\nwould say \u201cYou\u2019re not black!\u201d or, \u201cIs\nthat the capital city of Africa?\u201d when\nI told them I was from Kenya. Until\nthis summer I hadn\u2019t been back since\nDecember 2008. After all, why would\nI want to go back to a place where\nelectricity ran three days a week and\nwhere hot water was a luxury? Life was\na lot more challenging than it should\nhave been. Yet \u2018home\u2019 is and always\nwill be Kenya. I think most Kenyans\nwould agree that we are happy to\nslate Kenya as much as possible but\nwe have very, very little tolerance for\nforeigners doing it. This is borne out\nof a sense of pride. The jubilation at\nBarack Obama becoming president\nof the USA was huge in Kenya. It\nprompted my dad to send me a text\nsaying, \u201cWananchi na kuja!\u201d meaning,\n\u201cThe local citizen has come.\u201d\nI followed the recent March\nelections as much as possible. Many\nmedia and news agencies claimed\nthey were the most important\nelection in Kenyan history. This\ncannot be stressed enough. Yet no one\ncites Kenyan history to support this,\nsave the bloodshed five years ago. It\nwas incredible to see large queues at\nthe voting stations. \u201cWe have been\nwaiting for this for the past five years.\u201d\nWere the comments of a Mr. Anthony\nWachira to the BBC.\nThe great thing about primary\nschool in Kenya is the two main\naspects of our history classes: The\nRoman Empire and Kenyan history.\nOur teacher was a very passionate\nIrishman.\nKenya was a British colony since\nthe end of the 19th century as part\nof the East Africa Protectorate.\nIt served as a British base during\nWorld War 1. Following this, political\nactivity in Kenya started to grow as\nthe local people bore the brunt of\nthe increased taxes and lower wages.\nKenya was an important British base\nin World War 2, stimulating African\nnationalism. Meanwhile tensions\nwere rising between the British (who\nwanted to impose their agricultural\nmethods) and the Kikuyu tribe (who\nrefused). As a reaction to exclusion\nfrom political representation the\nKikuyu people founded Kenya\u2019s first\nAfrican political protest movement\nin 1921. It was the Young Kikuyu\nAssociation led by Harry Thuku.\nThe most famous events occurred\nbetween 1952 to 1956, known as the\nMau Mau Uprising, an armed local\nKikuyu movement directed against\nthe colonial government and the\nEuropean settlers. It was the largest\n(and most ferocious) movement in\nBritish Africa. The Mau Mau fighters\nare declared as freedom heroes\nbut the Mau Mau movement was\ndescribed as, \u201ca disease which had\nbeen eradicated and must never be\nremembered again,\u201d by soon-to-be\nfirst Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta.\nIn June British Foreign Secretary\nWilliam Hague announced that\nKenyans tortured by British colonial\nforces during the Mau Mau uprising\nwill receive payouts totalling \u00a320m.\nIn 1962 a coalition government\nformed and a constitution was\nestablished. Kenya achieved self-Government with Jomo Kenyatta as its\nfirst Prime Minister. He is renowned\nas founding father of Kenya. Ethnic\ntensions remained as Kenyatta of\nthe Kikuyu tribe reallocated \u201crepossessed land\u201d from European\nfarmers to his fellow Kikuyus. This\ncreated tensions with the other tribes.\nLikewise President Moi redistributed\nwealth to his Kalenjin tribe while\nmarginalising (and even attacking) the\nother Kikuyu and Luo tribes. Having\ngoverned with a corrupted iron fist\nfrom 1978-2002 fresh elections took\nplace, leading to Mwai Kibaki being\nnamed president. There was much\nhope in Kenya and the economy grew\nrapidly, until Kibaki was ensnared\nin Moi\u2019s leftovers. Kibaki\u2019s regime\nquickly fell apart and Raila Odinga\n(supported Kibaki in 2002) attacked\nKibaki\u2019s government in the lead up to\nthe 2007 elections. Kibaki and Odinga\nwere the main contestants in the 2007\nelection which appeared to have been\nwon by Odinga, until accusations of\nvote-rigging filtered in. Kibaki swore\nhimself in as President.\nMonths of ethnic violence followed\nbetween the Kikuyus, Luos and\nKalenjins.\nEnough has been written about the\natrocities. One of my idols, Wangari\nMaathai (first woman to win the\nNobel Peace Prize), said, \u201cIf they had\nresources and better leadership they\nwould not be killing each other over\ngrazing ground and water.\u201d\nA new constitution was set out by\nthe government in 2010. It is the first\n(desperately needed) redaction since\nthe 1969 constitution It has been met\nby widespread international acclaim\nin its efforts to tackle corruption and\nstrengthen civil society. The recent\nelection was pitted as a two-horse\nrace between Raila Odinga and Uhuru\nKenyatta (son of Jomo, the first Prime\nMinister). The latter (who won) stands\naccused by the International Criminal\nCourt along with his Deputy President\nWilliam Ruto for being involved in\norganising the 2007 attacks.\nI returned to Kenya this summer\nand was astounded. There are new\nhigh-rise buildings and apartments\neverywhere in Nairobi. The Chinese\nhave built some new flyovers and\nrepaired some main roads. Roads\nleading out to other major cities have\nalso been built. Whatever you can get\nhere, you can now get over there .\nI was in Nairobi at the time of\nthe Westgate terrorist attack. I live\nquite close by. Investigations are\nonging and new CCTV footage is\nstill being released: It further lets the\nGovernment down. Police and Army\nwerefound to have looted the banks\nand jewellery shops in the building.\nThis is a strange situation for me.\nKenya is an outrageously bountiful\ncountry of wildlife, scenery and\nculture. Kenya\u2019s economy is on the\nverge of massive growth and yet things\nsocial security is still terrible. Traffic\nis horrendous and the inner city roads\nare still gravel.\nEye-watering sums of money are\nbeing invested into projects like\nKonza City which aims to be the\n\u2018silicon savannah\u2019. It will cost around\nUS$14.5billion. There have also been\noil discoveries in Lake Turkana,. This\nshould be good news. I consider myself\nan African and therefore optimism is\nnot a choice; it is a necessity. I have\nfaith in Uhuru Kenyatta to leave a\nmeaningful legacy. If he doesn\u2019t, I\nhope that the next president will.\nHope springs eternal.

Did it feel satisfying\nto know you\u2019ve cultivated such a\ndedicated fanbase?\nYeah, it was really exciting on one\nlevel, but obviously you don\u2019t want\nto see the whole enterprise purely in\nfinancial terms but just as a show of\nfaith it was quite lovely. I would say it\nwas quite a heartwarming experience.\nA lot of the business experience of\nbeing in a band, and it\u2019s increasingly\na business, is cold and lonely and\ndepressing. So even though it was\nsomething that was just a headlines\nday, and a lot of the work began from\nthat point, it was still lovely. As much\nas it sounds false, I will never forget it,\ngenuinely very exciting.\nWhat prompted the decision to\nhave the whole album streaming in\nadvance of its release date?\nIt\u2019s a question of publicity and\nalso because we had some production\nproblems with the CD production.\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t go into that\nbecause of legal reasons, I\u2019d love to go\ninto that, because I love to pick a fight,\nit\u2019s one of my favourite things to do. It\nbecame a question of the fact that the\nalbum wouldn\u2019t be available until the\n28th rather than the 21st so if people\nwere going to be talking about the\nrecord, we wanted them to be talking\nabout the actual songs, not the fact it\nwas going to be delayed.\nF\nYou\u2019ve come out in the past and\nvilified file sharing. What was the\nstory there?\nI think it\u2019s important in terms of\nthe blog post I wrote when our album\nleaked two and a half months early\na few years ago, that was specifically\nabout leaks as opposed to file sharing.\nI\u2019m not the hugest fan of file sharing,\nI don\u2019t know many self-respecting\nmusicians who are, although some\npeople have convinced themselves\nthat they are. Leaks are a different\nthing, especially when they happen\nso early, because people have got into\nyour record, extracted the fat and\nprotein, and moved onto something\nelse, even if they\u2019ve really enjoyed it, a\nmonth before your record even exists\ntangibly. Also, when you release an\nalbum, you want a sense of occasion, I\nwouldn\u2019t go as far as to say a party, but\nyou want it to certainly be an event\nin your life. When it\u2019s been leaked so\nearly, when it is eventually released,\nit\u2019s just apologetically farted out into\nthe world.\nHow did you come up with the voice\nin Singing of the Bonesaws?\nI don\u2019t honestly know. Maybe\nI hadn\u2019t had enough oxygen to my\nbrain that day. I was listening to the\nend of the first test between England\nand Australia in the middle of doing\nvocal takes and I was a bit nervous,\nso maybe something in me decided\nto become really English as a coping\nmechanism.\nYour lyrics are often highly surreal\nand amusing. What is your writing\nprocess?\nIn general, the lyrics are usually\njust thrown together at the last\nmoment. Sometimes, when they are\nthrown together at the last moment\nthey don\u2019t work, and they\u2019re the songs\nthat nobody ends up hearing. More\noften than not I think it\u2019s really helpful\nto the creative process to have some\npressure. We\u2019ve finished recording\nfor the day, everybody else is having\ndinner, you\u2019ve got an hour to write\ntwo songs, go. That kind of situation\nbrings out the best in me.\nYou made the unusual decision to\nrelease an EP, Human Death, at the\nsame time as the album. How did\nthat come about?\nWe just wrote a lot of songs that\nwe really loved which weren\u2019t maybe\nas focused as the record. We definitely\ndon\u2019t see them as b-sides, in any sense.\nWe see them as being part of a slightly\nmore considered musical approach.\nFor example, in the case of Fucked Up\nRunners, that was kind of our jokey,\nvery self-conscious attempt at doing\na song with a kind of Shellac-y guitar\nsound. To us, if that had ended up\non the problem album, it would have\nsounded too much like a pastiche.\nAre you looking forward to getting\nback on the road and touring the\nnew album?\nI am, especially if my back gets\nbetter, because I\u2019ve been in agony for\nthe last few weeks. I went to see an\nosteopath this morning, so if I can\nstand up straight, I will enjoy touring a\nlot more. Although I feel lucky to have\na job and earn some money, nothing\ncomes close to playing rock n roll.\nYou\u2019re well known for your on stage\nrants and putting hecklers down. Is\nthis something you plan or does it\ncome out naturally when you\u2019re on\nstage?\nWhen I started playing, I didn\u2019t say\nanything in between songs because I\ndidn\u2019t know what to say and also,\nwhen nobody knows who you are,\nwhat\u2019s the fucking point in talking?\nThere was maybe a time, when Kelson\nwas in the band as well, when perhaps\nthe talking and people talking back at\nus from the crowd got a bit too much.\nThere\u2019s a balance to be drawn. You\nneed to remember it is about the rock.\nThere\u2019s some genuinely funny people\nwho come to see us, but sometimes\nyou just find people who know the\nreputation of the band and just want\nto be arseholes and make the show\nabout them. If that happens, we just\nget them fucking chucked out.\n\n"

Harmony Korine\u2019s Spring\nBreakers is certainly a tricky one to\ncome to grips with, something that\nrequires patience and a completely\ndifferent level of expectations from\nthe action-packed, girl-power film it\npromises to be. But something that\ncannot be faulted is James Franco\u2019s eccentric supporting turn, which alone\nmakes the movie worth seeing. His\ntattooed, dreadlocked, fake-toothed\nappearance is a shocker, and the acting\nthat goes with it is remarkable.\nSam Rockwell (The Way, Way Back)\nWith dialogue such as \u201cYou see what\nI did there? I manipulated her with\nmy sexual charisma\u201d, the sleazy-look-ing Sam Rockwell is full of hilarious\none-liners, as he runs a summer wa-ter-park in this heartwarming indie\ncomedy. His supporting turn is an\nabsolute triumph in a film that boasts\nseveral top-notch cast members. Sure,\nthe film was released during summer\nas a vacation family movie, but there\nshould be enough charm and quality\nin the coming-of-age story to warrant\nsome worthy attention and spotlight\nhis tremendous role.\nDavid Oyelowo (The Butler)\nAngry and rebellious, with his im-pulsive, fiery temper, although never\nwithout a justifiable cause, David Oyelowo\u2019s performance is electrifying. As\na black man growing up in a society\nthat never fully embraces him, it\u2019s only\nunderstandable that he has such a distorted view of the unkind world. The\ninevitable conflict that arises between\nhim and his government-serving father is tragic and heartbreaking, and\nas one important half of such relation-ship, Brit actor Oyelowo absolutely\nnails it opposite Oscar-winning Forest\nWhitaker.\nJake Gyllenhaal (Prisoners)\nAs a hardworking detective determined to get to the bottom of a mysterious kidnapping case that only\ngets more and more complicated as\nhidden evidence and the past slowly\nstart opening up, Gyllenhaal\u2019s at-times\ngreatly restrained and at-times incredibly intense, moody performance, as\nwell as that intricate balance between\nthe two, is a part of what keeps this\n150-minute crime drama thriller so\nutterly compelling. As he becomes\ntired and frustrated, we do too, but the\ntough investigative process is made\nmore relatable thanks to him.\nJames Gandolfini (Enough Said)\nAs a plus-sized man with a heart of\ngold, the late James Gandolfini\u2019s untimely passing makes this grown-up\nromantic comedy all the more touching and poignant. Two divorced adults\nin their mid-fifties try their luck once\nmore with falling in love, although this\ntime there are other problems that\npresent themselves between the cou-ple. Gandolfini delivers the humourous aspect of his character well, and\nis a worthy star opposite Julia LouisDreyfus, but it\u2019s the more vulnerable\nside of him with his cuddly big heart\nthat really wins us all over.\nSteve Coogan (Philomena)\nPossibly the least showy role on the\nlist, but in keeping with the film\u2019s\ngeneral tone, it\u2019s the quieter, more\nsubdued performance that makes\nthe most impact, which is what Steve\nCoogan brings to the table. There\u2019s\nplenty of dry humour for him to play\naround with, but ultimately it\u2019s his\nchemistry with Judi Dench that makes\nthe pair\u2019s travelogue so richly dense,\nwith touching drama and appropriate wit. His character\u2019s transformation\nthroughout the film is exceptionally\ncaptured by Coogan, who proves his\nknack for drama as well.\nMatthew McConaughey (Mud)\nOne of McConaughey\u2019s more serious\nroles, where he doesn\u2019t turn on the\ncheese or lay on his thick Southern\naccent; one to show us what a versatile actor he can really be. As fugitive\non the run, McConaughey possesses\nall the right necessary rough edges\nto convince, but there is more to his\n\u2018Mud\u2019 character than what you may initially be shown. He\u2019s someone deeply\nin love with possibly the wrong wom-an, and with this comes heartbreak,\nunlikely friendship and touching sac-rifice. Mud was quite the indie critical\nhit, so a nomination is possible.\nJeremy Renner (American Hustle)\nDavid O. Russell\u2019s American Hustle is\nthe kind of film that could be nominated for all four acting categories next\nyear. We already discussed Jennifer\nLawrence having the potential to be\na part of the Best Supporting Actress\ngang, and with this category, it\u2019s a difficult choice between Jeremy Renner\nand Bradley Cooper. But since Cooper\nreceived plenty of attention last year,\nwe\u2019re siding with Renner on this one...\nfor the moment. Donning that ridiculous 1970s retro hairdo for the new\nheist film, Renner is one of the most\nunder-awarded actors around.\nJonah Hill (The Wolf of Wall Street)\nWho knew that awkward, insecure kid\nfrom Superbad could be considered as\na contender during awards season and\nin particular, the Oscar race? Having\nalready been nominated once before\nfor Moneyball, things are starting to\nlook promising again for Jonah Hill,\nwho stars in a Martin Scorsese film\nthat is due to be released in the States\non Christmas Day which is a real double whammy when it comes to the\nkind of backing you have. Here his role\nseems to be more comedic in nature,\nwhich will no doubt work towards his\nadvantage.\nDaniel Br\u00fchl (Rush)\nRon Howard\u2019s exhilarating Formula\n1 drama benefits hugely from its unforgettable race sequences (and lots\nof them, too), but when it comes to\nselling the biopic part of the film, it\u2019s\nthe actors who do all the hard work.\nAs Niki Lauda, Daniel Br\u00fchl makes a\nmemorable figure of the legend. There\nis tragedy that surrounds his charac-ter, one that Br\u00fchl plays to the right\nlevel of sensitivity without overdoing\nthe suffering. It\u2019s a rousing perfor-mance, one that proudly stands out\neven amongst all the more obvious\nloud engines and squeaky tires.\n\n"

Trisomy\n21 is caused by the presence of all or\npart of an extra copy of chromosome\n21 in a person\u2019s DNA.\nDown\u2019s patients suffer from many\nphysiological disabilities such as\nhypotonia (reduced muscle tone),\nsandal toe, congenital heart defects,\nbrachydactyly (short fingers), a flat\nfacial profile and skeletal deformities.\nDown\u2019spatientsstrugglewithactivities\nlike walking, sitting, standing, reading\netc. There is no current cure for\nDown\u2019s Syndrome but support is given\nto help patients lead a healthier, active\nand independent lifestyle.\nCurrent antenatal screening\ninvolves a combined test done in the\nfirst trimester between the 11th and\n13th weeks of pregnancy and includes\nultrasoundscreening(usedtomeasure\nthickness of tissue at the back of the\nfoetus neck) and a hormonal test of the\nmother\u2019s blood (to detect high levels\nof Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin\nand Estriol). The results of these tests\nalong with the mother\u2019s age are used\nto predict the risk to the foetus \u2013 this\nmethod picks up about 90% of cases.\nFor high-risk pregnancies, further\nmethods of testing include: Chorionic\nVillus Sampling, which involves\ntaking cell samples from the placenta;\nand, Amniocentesis, where a sample\nof amniotic fluid is taken. These are\nsubsequently analysed for presence\nof the extra chromosome 21 copy.\nHowever, both methods are invasive\nand carry a 1% chance of miscarriage\nand a false positive chance of 3-4%.\nThe new antenatal blood test\nuses \u2018foetal cell free\u2019 (cf) DNA that\nis present in the mother\u2019s blood\nto scan for the presence of the\nextra chromosome 21. The study,\npublished in the journal \u2018Ultrasound\nin Obstetrics and Gynaecology\u2019, shows\nthat in the 1005 pregnancies trialed\nat 10 weeks, there was a much lower\nfalse positive rate of 0.1% and a 99%\nrate of Down\u2019s Syndrome detection.\nCurrently, this test is only being\noffered privately and to any pregnant\nwomen who volunteer to participate\nin the ongoing trials. Professor\nNicolaides added that this new\ntechnique \u201cif offered across the UK,\nwould have the potential to increase\nthe diagnosis rate from 1,000 cases\nto almost all of the 1,200 which occur\nevery year\u201d.\nProfessor Lyn Chitty of Great\nOrmond Street Hospital confirms that\nthis could \u201cvery significantly reduce\nthe number of invasive tests\u201d as only\n0.5% of cases that had the blood test\nrequired any form of invasive testing.\nEarly detection of the condition in\nfoetusescanhelpparentstoplanahead\nand also gives them time to learn more\nabout the condition and how they can\nhelp their child. However, at \u00a3400 a\ntest, it seems highly unlikely that will\nbe readily available through the NHS\nany time soon.\nDOI: 10.1002/uog.12504\nThere is plenty of on-going research\nin the field of battling cancer, whether\nchemically, physically or biologically.\nA research group from southern\nCalifornia is developing a new\nstrategy on improving the transport\nof medicine within the patients\u2019 body,\nby creating antibodies which only\nactivate in the presence of cancer cells.\nThe idea of using monoclonal\nantibodies (antibodies cloned from\na unique parent) is not a new one,\nand has existed for almost a century.\nHowever, due to side effects and the\nway certain antibodies attack the\ncancer cells, there has only recently\nbeen approval for their use. For\nexample, the Cetuximab antibody\nreleases antigens which can become\ntoxic to skin cells in high doses,\nlimiting the effectiveness of this\ntreatment.\nAttempts to use antibody-drug\nconjugates have shown potential, but\nare still limited due to skin toxicity.\nHowever, due to healthy tissue cells\nexpressing similar properties to the\ndiseased cells, the antibodies are not\nalways able to make the distinction\nand may target healthy tissue too.\nA solution was proposed by a team\nof researchers led by Desnoyers\nLuc, to mediate the toxicity of the\nantibodies based on the surrounding\ncells. While the antibodies would\nstill have the power to knock out\ncancerous infections, they would only\nrelease the antigens in the presence of\nthe intended cells.\nThe research group developed the\nEGFR antibody PB1 based on the\npreviously trialled Cetuximab and\ntheir tests have shown hopeful results.\nComparing the two in mice tissues,\nPB1 and Cetuximab both showed\nclose to 80% reduction in cancer cells.\nHowever, when tested in primate cells,\nCetuximab caused the predicted skin\ntoxicity, although no such observation\nwas made in the PB1-treated bodies.\nFurther tests were conducted at\nhigher doses, and for longer periods,\nafter which mild dermal toxicity was\nfound, but at a less severe level than\nthe Cetuximab.\nAnalysis and research are continuing\nin this area, but with more hopeful\nresults being shown, this could\ndevelop into quite a plausible method\nof treatment.\nDOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3006682\nAntibody treatment for cancer\nPavitar Singh Devgon\nScience Writer\nLove Science?\nOr want to be Brian Cox?

Such activity has highlighted the fact that both\nscience and politics are actually very much intertwined;\nsomething that can be easy to overlook.\nOur own Professor Nutt this week was rewarded the\n2013 John Maddox Prize for Standing up for Science,\nfor his impact in influencing drug classification, and his\ndedication to promoting science despite facing difficultly.\nHis paper earlier in the year, published in Nature,\nimplored the government to reconsider their rather\narbitrary drugs classifications to allow for a more\ncomprehensive scope into the research concerning illegal\ndrugs and their biochemical effects.\nWith drugs ranging from cannabis to MDMA having\npotential medicinal benefits for treating a whole host of\nailments, research has been stifled by the government\nlegislation surrounding lab acquisition of the drugs for\nexperimentation.\nHis relentless rebuttal against current legislation led to\nhis dismissal from the government, highlighting just how\nscience and politics can struggle together at times.\nOn a brighter note, the UK and Korea signed an\nagreement to advance fuel cell technology, with Imperial\u2019s\nown Professor James Stirling and Professor Taihyun\nChang, Provost and Executive Vice President of Pohang\nUniversity of Science and Technology in Korea, penning\ntheir names to agree to further engage in hydrogen and\nfuel cell technology.\nScience and politics can be so intrinsically involved that\nneither should be seen as entirely exclusive or independent\nof each other. The clash or collaboration between the two\nseem even more exuberated this week, but it is great to\nsee Imperial providing a platform for both of these.\nIt is important to remind ourselves that there is a bigger\nworld outside the microcosm of science and technology\nthat we currently seem to reside in on campus.\nThe science we are learning, the way in which we learn\nit, down to the jobs available for when we graduate are\nall sculpted according to the political landscape that\npaves Exhibition road and beyond. It is important to\nrecognise that science doesn\u2019t exist as a pure endeavour\nof the pursuit of knowledge but hangs within the larger\nframework of politics and policy.\nCancer cells like these may be targetted by the treatment\n\n"

Nowadays you can\u2019t wait to throw that\none year old trash out, to get the\nabsolutely newest piece of tech.\nAfraid of having to actually talk to\npeople, but still in need of not feeling so alone in the world? Then you\nare not the only one at imperial!\nEnter the smartphone. Snapchat,\niMessage, Facebook messenger,\namong many others, have circumvented the actual need to look into\nsomeone\u2019s eyes, while still allowing you to fulfil your daily communication quota. This easy road has\nmanifested itself in more and more\nridiculous ways. Smartphones are\nbanned from dinner tables, which\nthen feature stony silence. Groups\nof friends will often be seen all staring at their smartphones instead\nof actually having fun. Surely soon\nenough any form of communication\nwill be replaced by a 4-5 inch screen.\nyou a grainy picture of themselves\nbutt-naked, but all in all this is a\nnewer phenomenon. Yet not many\nare aware of the dangers that can\nhappen when you send something\nso private to anyone, so beware!\nWen u abbreviate everythin it aint\nhard 2 understand that spelling skills\nare fading, innit? Well after you read\nthrough that cancer-inducing sen-tences, consider the impact that text\nspeak is having on English. Textspeak\nis endemic in todays youth. Some of\nthese even use textspeak for official\ndocuments and emails. Yes you may\nargue it is faster to use, and quicker\nto read. However when you look at\nall the beauty that the English language possesses, and then imagine it\nall written in numbers, single letters\nand completely wrong spelling its\nenough to really become depressed.\nSince your smartphone becomes\nobsolete every year, it is not hard to\nimagine why people in general tend\nto update theirs on an almost annual basis. However this lies in stark\ncontrast to the time when durability and longevity of a gadget were\nprized, and the affection that grew\ntowards something that you used\nover the years. I mean remember\nA\nfter last weeks Osama\nAwara\u2019s \u201c10 things\nthe Internet has\nslaughtered\u201d, I decided\nto write something\nin a similar vein, except of course\nexchanging one vital invention\n(internet) of our lives for something\nequally important (smartphones). So\nhere goes (in no particular order).\nApart from a few notable exceptions\n(I am looking at you Pok\u00e9mon),\nsmartphone gaming has dominated\nthis market. It has lead to the decline\nof Sony\u2019s PSP line, as well as curbing any future dedicated consoles\nthat may have arisen. I mean, why\nshell out several hundred pounds on\nsomething that can only play games\nthat also cost 30-40 pounds a pop,\nwhen you could use that handy telephone of yours, spend 5 quid and\nget the same amount of pleasure.\nIn fact some people suspect smartphones will have a bigger impact\non the gaming industry as a whole!\nWith everything that these little\nwonder machines have to offer right\nat your fingertips, some people find\nit hard to keep their instant gratification monkey in check. Want to check\nthat hilarious YouTube video in the\nmiddle of a lecture? Sure go ahead!\nWant to buy something on amazon?\nGo ahead, your smartphone can do\nit! In fact smartphones have managed to kill this off so well, that some\npeople can\u2019t even control themselves\nlonger than 5 minutes, without\ncompulsively checking their phone.\nThese little gadgets were the bee's\nknees back in the day, ready to on\none hand wow your friends with awesome tracks that you never listened\nto, and on the other croon to you on\nthe bus with the tracks that absolutely embarrassed you. However with\nthe advent of the smartphone, the\ndevice that could do all of the above\nAND make phone calls, the future of\nthe one-track gadgets was doomed.\nWhy wait when everything is just\nright in your pocket? What is the\npoint of waiting to see a message,\nemail or tweet when you could see\nyour messages within a matter of\nseconds? In fact why doesn't everyone answer right away? With the\nadvent of smartphones and constant\navailability, any need to wait necessary or unnecessary is questioned.\nKind of obvious isn\u2019t it? Why have a\nboring old feature phone (you know\nthose ancient things that have physical keys) when you could have a su-per-duper awesome califragilisticex-pialidocious smartphone that does\neverything you could ever imagine?!?\nIn the past portraits were reserved for\nthe rich and wealthy. Even with the\ninvention of cameras, people would\nnot have wasted their money, time\nor film (hopefully) on taking a selfie.\nHowever with the ease of snapping\na quick pic introduced by smart-phones, this inhibition of blatant\nself-love has been eroded. Nowadays\nyou can't escape the outstretched\narm and pouty lips/tensed muscles\nthat accompany many a selfie on\nany social media sites that you visit.\nCome on, lets face it, how many of\nyou never attempted to sext with\nsomeone? Yeah I thought so. The\npromised instant gratification, and\nassurances of deleted messages have\nall to often led some of us astray.\nHowever before the dawn of the\nsmartphone, sexting was almost unheard of.

With Game of Thrones\ndirector Alan Taylor taking over the\nreins from Kenneth Branagh, it seems\nreasonable to expect things to take a\ndarker, grimier tone than the rather\ncamp, light-hearted original and, well,\nthey do.\nAfter the standard opening monologue from Odin (Anthony Hopkins),\nevents instantly launch into a full-scale battle (one of many), which looks\nfar prettier than it has any right to be,\nconsidering it takes place in a world\nquite literally entitled The Dark World\n(why yes, it is that Dark World from\nthe title, however did you guess). This\ngrimy yet weirdly pretty quality seeps\nthrough the entire film \u2013 Asgard is\nabsolutely beautiful, and the FX are\nsecond to none (the 3D\u2019s even kind of\ngood, in that \u2018doesn\u2019t quite justify the\nextra price of entry but still looks nice\u2019\nway). The design of the Dark Elves\nfeels a bit generic (although their ship\ninteriors bear more than a few similarities to the feel of the Xenomorphs\nfrom Alien, which gives them bonus\ncreepiness), but since the focus is less\non them and more on the action, it\u2019s\nnot a major issue.\nSpeaking of the action (of which\nthere is a lot), it\u2019s just as good as anything that\u2019s come before in the Marvel\nfilm universe, and in some cases goes\non to better it. It\u2019s as quippy as you\u2019d\nexpect from a Marvel film (as evidenced within the first two minutes of\nThor\u2019s (Chris Hemsworth) introductory fight), but it also ranges from the\nlarge-scale battles that echo those in\nAvengers Assemble to epic one-on-ones, including both a barnstorming\naction sequence on the Dark World\nand the finale, a inter-dimensional\nbattle between Thor and Malekith\n(Chris Eccleston) that consistently\nwrong-foots everyone involved, from\nthe participants to the audience (and\nis all the more fantastic for it).\nThe twisty-turny nature of the finale\nis representative of the plot as a whole\n\u2013 there\u2019s a lot going on here, and while\nit\u2019s not exactly difficult to follow it can\nmean that the two major, surprisingly\npowerful emotional sequences feel\na little weakened. On the flip-side:\nmuch more time spent on them would\nhave dragged the film down into an\nover-long, intolerable mess, so taking\nit as it is is definitely the better option\nhere.\nOf course, all this prettiness and delightful plot would count for naught\nwere the actors completely useless,\nand that\u2019s definitely not the case here.\nHemsworth is as comfortable with\nMjolnir as he\u2019s ever been, Tom Hiddleston is the undeniable highlight as\nImperial Cinema\nAs a special Post-Grad Film Night\nwe\u2019re showing the critically acclaimed coming-of-age drama Mud.\nWith echoes of the Adventures of\nHuckleberry Finn it tells the story of\ntwo teenage boys in rural Arkansas\nwho meet and help a reclusive fugitive called Mud (Matthew McConaughey) who is hiding out in hope\nof a reunion with an ex girlfriend\ncalled Juniper (Reese Witherspoon).\nAs the travails of adolescence ensue,\nthe two boys clash with Mud and\nlearn about the hardships of family,\nlove and the loss of innocence.\nKick-Ass 2 is the acid-tongued\nsequel to the raucous comic book\nmovie send-up.

Chris Eccleston\nfeels a little wasted as Malekith considering he spends most of his time\njust making strange noises, though, as\ndoes Natalie Portman when her role is\nmostly reduced to damsel-in-distress\nreplete with bonus sarky assistant (Kat\nDennings, still fantastic).\nThere are plenty of additional\ntreats throughout the film \u2013 from\none completely predictable cameo to\none (hilarious) surprise one \u2013 and it\u2019s\ndefinitely another Marvel film that demands a rewatch just to fully appreciate it all. A couple of plot points do go\nmissing in action (namely the potential for a Sif-Thor-Jane love triangle),\nbut on the whole it\u2019s all wrapped up\nnicely in one of the year\u2019s best films.\nAs for the stings: well, see them for\nyourself. There are two, after all\u2026\nDame Judi\u2019s finest hour\nPhilomena\nDirector: Stephen Frears\nWriters: Stephen Frears, Jeff Pope,\nMartin Sixsmith (novel)\nStarring: Judi Dench, Steve Coogan\nRuntime: 98 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nStephen Frears\u2019 latest \u201cinspired by a\ntrue story\u201d drama is a rousing crowd-pleaser that will make you cry and\nlaugh throughout with its extraordinary retelling of what started off as a\nhorrifying event. A child is torn away\nfrom his mother, and for 50 long years\nshe has kept this a secret, ashamed of\nsuch past, stemming from her long-running faith in the Catholic Church.\nShe finally gathers up the courage to\nshare this painful information, which\nleads to a desperate search for her\nlong-lost son who she knows nothing\nabout, but who she has never stopped\nthinking of.\nPhilomena Lee (Judi Dench) is one\nof many women who were sent off to\nan Irish convent to spend their youthful years working almost like slaves\nunder the fierce command of harsh,\nstrict nuns. A pregnancy out of wedlock and a forced adoption abroad\nis her \u201chuman-interest\u201d story, and\nhelping her tell this is disgraced ex-BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith\n(Steve Coogan). Together Philomena\nand Martin strike up the unlikeliest\nfriendship in search for a boy they\nonly know as Anthony.\nAnd so starts the thoroughly entertaining journey that eventually takes\nthem across the Atlantic to the States\nwhere the two outstanding performances of the film\u2019s leads are put to\ntremendous use. Dench\u2019s heart-break-ing portrayal is without doubt the\nhighlight, and so are the outrageously hysterical one-liners Philomena\ncomes up with, said in all seriousness\nwithout actually trying to be funny.\nWe saw Dame Maggie Smith drop the\nf-bomb in last year\u2019s Quartet. Here\nDame Judi Dench drops a \u201cc\u201d one...not\nTHE C-word...but something close.\nWith her incredibly sweet and moving\nperformance, Dench is an unstoppable powerhouse breaking your heart\nwith her every glance.\nHer travel companion Coogan is\nequally as effective, providing the\ncomplete opposite of the God-respecting, very courteous, socially\nunaware grandmother. Together they\nenter deep discussions about religion,\nsex, among others, and it\u2019s an onscreen pairing that is never boring.\nSixsmith at first isn\u2019t all that invested\nin the story: it\u2019s something he does\ninstead of writing books about Russian history he knows no one will read\nnow that he\u2019s unemployed. And yes\nthey have their differences, most obviously so when it comes to discussing\nGod, but as time goes by he warms to\nher view of the world, and is clearly\ndrawn more and more to help her find\nclosure.\nThere are many unexpected turns\nthe film takes, none of them an unbelievable development, but ones\nthat amount to something a lot more\npoignant and thought-provoking.\nTears will flow as Dench dominates\nthe screen with never-ending warmth,\nand when there is sadness there will be\nas many moments of laughter, and it\u2019s\nthis delicate balance that gives the film\nits endless likability, one that is never\nforced, but instead charms with its\ngentle, genuine storytelling.\nscreenrush.com\n\n"

    "content": "5\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 08 NOV\nFEATURES\nA\nfortnight ago you read\nabout the IPCC report\u2019s\nfinger-pointing, 7 days\nlater you glanced over\nthe future of energy\nsourcing\u2026now we will have you\ncontemplate sustainable strategies\nfor business, policy, and the general\neconomics of the future!\nWhat exactly does sustainability\nmean? Simply put, a business is\nsustainable if it minimizes its adverse\nimpacts on the environment and\nincorporates environmentally-friendly operating principles while\nmanaging to return a net profit, so\nas to keep things going. So, what\nwill allow a business to continuously\nreturn a net profit in such a manner?\nOne answer is by making products\nthat last long. In the current times,\nconsumerism has taken on a fickle\nmask causing people to regularly\nreplace their gadgetry and personal\nhardware \u2013 according to a 2011 survey\nby the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), people in the UK get a new\nphone every 22 months, only beaten\nto \u2018top\u2019 spot by the US of A\u2026 similar\ntrends exist for TV sets, cars, and\nother accessories. Such a trend has\nbeen in part perpetrated by mobile\ncontract operators who tend to offer\nhandset upgrades at the end of a\ncontract\u2019s tenure. There is little sign of\nthis being on the turn; however recent\nviral concepts such as Phonebloks\n(from Kickstarter) have shown that\nthere is substantial consumer demand\nfor electronic products that are more\nsustainable, with companies such as\nMotorola showing great interest and\nsupposedly developing a very similar\nconcept phone of their own.\nStemming from that thought,\nanother answer may well be to\nimplement infrastructure that\nencourage consumers to embrace\ne nv i ro n m e nt a l l y - s u s t a i n ab l e\nconcepts. For instance, constructing\nbuildings using more steel than\nconcrete, incorporating solar cells\nand mini wind-turbines into their\ndesigns, developing materials that\nabsorb and trap CO2\nto lay pavements\nwith \u2013 these are all examples of how\nsustainability has been introduced\ninto various communities around the\nworld.\nNote,however,theword\u2018introduced\u2019.\nFor any semblance of sustainability,\nideas have to be implemented on\na large-enough scale to make a\ndifference, which is where economics\nand policy can play their part in\nmaking things happen. To simplify the\neconomics to an almost-sacrilegious\nlevel, if policy makers were to rule that\nall future construction in a town/city\nwould have to conform to particular\nstandards and designs incorporating\nsustainability, the demand for the\nappropriate products and raw\nmaterials would increase, making\nbusiness profitable for suppliers, while\ndemand for sustainable construction\nwould also rise, at the very least\nmaintaining profit margins for\nconstructors.\nThis change can also be brought\nabout by greater consumer awareness.\nAt the recent 20th Anniversary event\nby Global Action Plan, a UK-based\ncharity focusing on encouraging\nenvironmentally-conscious behavior,\nChris Rapley noted that if CO2 were\norange and noxious, people would\nvery likely be a lot more concerned\nabout it and the mitigation issue\nmight already have been addressed\nby now. This implies that: because\none does not consciously get directly\naffected by increased CO2 levels in\nour daily lives, one feels less inclined\nto take any steps against it. As a result,\nbusinesses which already attempt to\nbe sustainable and promote it to their\ncustomers, somehow find their efforts\nnot being reciprocated in terms of\ninterest from the market. Thus, the\nchallenge is to motivate people to\nworry about climate change and\nsustainability by showing them how it\nwill affect their lives.\nOn the other hand, there are\nbusinesses and sectors of the economy\nthat are decidedly unsustainable, such\nas petrochemical companies and\ntheir associated industries. How can\nthey make a difference? On paper,\none possible strategy is to focus on\nbiofuels development, but that would\nrequire a substantial write-off in terms\nof capital and an unhealthy level of\nfresh expenditure to merely adapt\ntheir business to biofuels, after which\nthere would be the costs and problems\nassociated with securing land suitable\nfor cultivating biofuel crops, and so\non. It may well be that they would\nhave to completely shift their focus\nand redevelop their brands.\nThere are yet many more issues to be\ndiscussedinsuchafashion.Howwould\nfuture conurbations, megalopolises,\nand even \u2018smart\u2019 cities be planned and\ndesigned? Will a ranking on the Dow\nJones Sustainability Index become the\nsingle most important statistic for a\nbusiness to predict its future? Should\npolicymakers be obliged to be climate-aware and incorporate sustainability\ninto policies? Well, we are no experts\nbut we are certainly keen to hear some\nof them discuss exactly these issues\nthis Saturday in College.\nWant to hear more conclusive\nand insightful discussions about\nsustainable business, policy and\neconomics of the future?

This is an interesting event for\npostgraduate students and staff members,\nmost of whom still fondly remember the old\npub.\nThere are some major improvements\nin the new venue, including a dedicated\nfood service, a larger drinking space, easy\nwheelchair access and more space for club\nand society activities. On the downside for\nPG\u2019s and staff members they\u2019ve lost the use\nof two snooker tables and they have to share\npart of the space with undergraduate students\nfor a Monday\u2013Thursday dinner service (5:30-7PM), albeit with the bar section separated by\na partition. We look forward to your letters\nabout the new h-bar, all comments welcome,\nwhether glowing praise or long rants. Well,\nreasonably long rants.\nTuesday saw the presence of Imperial\nregular, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.\nThe mayor came to campus to take part in a\n\u2018People\u2019s Question Time\u2019, which was an event\nwhere the people of London had the chance\nto hold him to account in a public forum.\nTickets were quickly snapped up and luckily\nFelix was able to attend, and we were even\nable to get an exclusive picture of the Mayor\noutside the library, moments before he began\nhis cycle home.\nFinally, yes there was a colossal amount of\nrainforsomepartsofthisweek,italmostmakes\none tempted to check the weather forecast.

Pumpkin is a perfect winter veggie that\u2019s chock-full\nof versatility; it lends itself to lovely hearty soups which are great for\nthis cold weather.\nSo don\u2019t bin it all just yet - here\u2019s a quick recipe that makes the most of\nthis yummy ingredient, a great treat for you and your friends!\nFor the cake\n300g self-raising flour\n300g light muscovado sugar\n3 tsp mixed spice\n2 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n175g sultanas\n\u00bd tsp salt\n4 eggs, beaten\n200g butter, melted\nzest 1 orange\n1 tbsp orange juice\n500g (peeled weight) pumpkin or butternut squash flesh, grated\n*Protip: You can substitute with carrot for other times of the year!\nFor drenching and frosting\n200g pack soft cheese\n85g butter, softened\n100g icing sugar, sifted\nzest 1 orange and juice of half\nMethod\nHeat oven to 180C. Butter and line a 30 x 20cm baking or small\nroasting tin with baking parzchment. Put the flour, sugar, spice,\nbicarbonate of soda, sultanas and salt into a large bowl and stir to\ncombine. Beat the eggs into the melted butter, stir in the orange zest\nand juice, then mix with the dry ingredients till combined. Stir in the\npumpkin. Pour the batter into the tin and bake for 30 mins, or until\ngolden and springy to the touch.\nTo make the frosting, beat together the cheese, butter, icing sugar,\norange zest and 1 tsp of the juice till smooth and creamy, then set\naside in the fridge. When the cake is done, cool for 5 mins then turn\nit onto a cooling rack. Prick it all over with a skewer and drizzle with\nthe rest of the orange juice while still warm. Leave to cool completely.\nIf you like, trim the edges of the cake. Give the frosting a quick beat\nto loosen, then, using a palette knife, spread over the top of the cake\nin peaks and swirls. If you\u2019re making the cake ahead of time, keep it\nin the fridge then take out as many pieces as you want 30 mins or so\nbefore serving. Will keep, covered, for up to 3 days in the fridge. (But\nI\u2019m pretty sure it will all be eaten before then!)\nMichael Chung, Food Editor. Adapted from BBC Good Food\nA round-up on some of the world\u2019s foodie vices under threat - some luxurious, some less so\nSome Like It Hot...well, not all\nPumpkin Cake\nIt seems to have been quite a\ntumultuous year in foodie arena,\nwith many food items under threat.\nJust this Halloween, fans of the\nglobal cult favourite Sriracha hot\nsauce (affectionately known as\nRooster Sauce to some) breathed a\nsigh of relief when a judge denied a\ntemporary restraining order against\nthe manufacturing company, Huy\nFong Foods.\nThe plaintiffs? Residents of\nIrwindale, California; where Huy\nFong\u2019s new processing plant is located.\nLame food pun notwithstanding,\nthe city\u2019s main beef with Huy Fong\nwas that the spicy scent of ground\npeppers due to the company\u2019s chilli-processing season from Sept to Dec\nis a public nuisance in violation of\nthe municipal code. Some nearby\nresidents had complained of burning\neyes and throats, and had sued in\norder to shut down production which\nwould have seen the price of Sriracha\nsauce escalate due to massive demand\noutstripping supply. The company\naren\u2019t yet in the clear, the judge has\nset Nov 22 for a further hearing. By\nthen however, chilli processing will\nhave been complete which means\nthis year\u2019s sauce production is safe.\nAlthough the plant\u2019s long-term future\nis unclear.\nSriracha wasn\u2019t the only thing under\nshortage threat this year. Below we\ntake a look at some of the food items\nwhich came under the microscope this\nyear due to potential shortage .and we\nalso look at one cult foodie treat which\nwas brought back from the dead, shall\nwe say.\nCHOCOLATE\nDoubtless a good few of you will have\nseen some panicked/sentimental\nFacebook sharing of reports citing\nhow cocoa butter is becoming scarcer\nby the day, largely due to dwindling\nproduction in Ghana and the Ivory\nCoast caused by poor weather, plus\nthe fact cocoa trees take up to 4 years\nbefore producing cocoa beans so some\nfarmers have thrown in the towel as\nthe wait is \u201ctoo long.\u201d\nSome reports even cite predictions\nthat the world\u2019s supply of cocoa will\nrun out in about seven years, which\nwould mean that in order to keep our\nsupermarket shelves stocked with\ngrab-and-go treats, manufacturers\nwould have to start falling back on\nvegetable fat substitutions (palm oil),\nbulking bars out with more nut and\nfruit etc. More bubbles in the \u201cAero\nchocolate, now with more bubbles\nand less chocolate. A few years ago, at\nleast you knew all of the solid stuff you\nwere getting in your bar was actual\nchocolate.\nWINE\nPoor weather has also affected\nvineyard harvests (ergo wine\nproduction) in Europe over the last\nfew years, and the increase in wine\nconsumption in China and the US\nseems to have put pressure on supply.\nThe world went into a bit of a panic\nwhen Morgan Stanley published a\nreport saying that its research had\ndeduced a worldwide shortfall of up to\n300 million cases in 2012.\nThankfully 2013\u2019s harvest was\npredicted to be a strong one, and\nsubsequent harvests have also been\npredicted to be on the up which\nis welcome news, after years of\nmediocrity and cruddy weather for\nfarmers.\nOLIVES\nThe popular bar snack also fell victim\nto poor weather in both Spain and\nGreece (specifically Halkidiki olives),\nwith olive distributors around the\nworld citing that suppliers were highly\nlikely to hike prices up by at least half.\nGOAT\u2019S CHEESE\nWay back in 2009/2010, the\nNetherlands, one of the biggest\nproducers of goat\u2019s cheese had to\ncull thousands of pregnant ewes to\ncurb the spread of Q disease which\ncould spread to humans. The effects\nof this cull can still be felt now, with\ncheese production having dwindled\nboth there and in France; demand,\nhowever, has steadily increased since\nthen as goat\u2019s cheese has become\nmore fashionable amongst consumers\nand the catering trade.\nExperts predict that this Christmas\nwhich is traditionally when cheese\nsales have been known to skyrocket,\nsome people are just going to have to\ndo without.\nAnd one item that came back from\nthe dead.\nTWINKIES\nYes, we know it\u2019s not quite a real\ncake/food item amongst purists. It\u2019s\nonly fair that they do get a mention for\nthe bizarreness that happened when\nthey became scarce, $5 boxes of the\nstuff were hoarded when production\nceased due to makers Hostess Foods\ngoing bankrupt. One week before\nthey returned to store shelves being\nproduced under new ownership,\nan eBay user was trying to auction\noff some expired Twinkies as rare\ncollectibles for the price of $15,000,\n\u201cone that can be passed down the\nfamily and will only gain in value.\u201d\n\n"

I don\u2019t think\nit is really the done thing to do a\nhalf ironman as your first triathlon but\nI thought it was a great idea because\nI would be able to relax and get into\nit over the day, rather than be rushing\naround in a sprint. It turned out fine\nfor me, so my first piece of advice is to\nrecommend doing whatever distance\nyou like the sound of as your first race.\nThe Hever Castle Triathlon festival\nwas alive with over 5,000 competitors\naged between 7 and 70 years old\nenjoying a race to complement their\nlevel, from the children\u2019s sprint to the\nGauntlet half ironman, all around the\nstunning grounds and countryside.\nTheracecoursewaslinedbythousands\nof supportive spectators cheering\non everyone taking part. Piece this\ntogether with the live music, food,\ncastle grounds and entertainment\nand you\u2019ve got a killer race day. David\nMcNamee, ranked 13th in the world,\nand Ironman reigning champion, Lucy\nGossage, were the course favourites\non the new half iron distance racing\nalongside many first timers and\nuniversity teams.\nI hadn\u2019t done much training so I was\nfeeling a bit nervous when my alarm\nwent off at 5:30am on the morning\nof the big day. I clambered out of my\ntent and wandered down to transition\nand the race briefing with Josh (my\nboyfriend and supporter for the day),\nPit Pillatsch, and Nick Brierley (fel-low members of Imperial Triathlon\nClub). After a briefing on safety and\nthe course it was time to get going.\nThe mist cleared across the lake\nand a hot air balloon rose up over the\ncourse, giving those spectators what\ncan only be imagined as the prime\nrace course view.\nClose to 300 Gauntlet competitors\nentered the water awaiting the cannon\nto go off. I said goodbye to Pit and\nNick and as instructed, slid down\nthe slimy steps on my bum into the\nornamental lake, where you could\nactually walk out to the middle on a\ncarpet of weeds! I made for the start\nline, feeling too nervous to be cold,\nand positioned myself at the back to\none side of the group because I didn\u2019t\nwant to be swum over by all the super-fast swimmers when the gun went off.\nAs it turned out I spent pretty much\nall of the swim trying to pass the\npeople in front; next time I need to be\nRebecca Rowe gives her account as Imperial record good times against 5000\nmuch more aggressive and sprint off\nthe front. We first swam in a straight\nline out into the lake, and then turned\ninto a narrow channel for the second\nhalf of the 1.9 km course, through the\nRiver Eden and around the 16-acre\nisland. The crowd support from the\nbanks and bridges was amazing and I\nwas soon being hauled out of the water\nand running back towards transition.\nPit had a great swim and was already\nin T1 when I got there, simultaneously\nencouraging me and getting out on his\nbike at lightning speed. I took transition at a more leisurely pace \u2013 I was\nfully aware it would be a long day and I\nwanted to stay as comfy and relaxed as\npossible to make sure I finished. After\n15 minutes, an energy bar and a quick\nhug from Josh I was on my way to the\n90km bike course.\nThis was the part I was most worried about, having ridden a road bike\nonly four times ever before the race I\nwas definitely venturing into the unknown here. Within about 5 km I had\nalready bounced my bike bottle out of\nits holder on a pothole leaving me very\nthirsty until the first water station at\n20 km, where I surprised the volunteers by coming to a complete halt to\npick up a new water bottle because I\nwasn\u2019t confident enough to do it riding along like everyone else. It was a\nbeautiful hilly course with great views\nand the weather was perfect so I settled in and really enjoyed it. Towards\nthe end, the low riding position became very painful to maintain and it\nwas my back rather than my legs that\nthanked me as I finally reached T2\nand ran back to my rack, 5 hours after\nI had left it.\nI only spent 10 minutes in transition this time, and got out on to the\nrun feeling good. Maybe I felt a bit too\ngood as I accidently ran my first mile\nin 7 minutes, which is about my 5 km\npace (so it was a good thing I looked\nat my watch and slowed down before I completely destroyed my legs).\nFrom the 4th mile, I had begun walking about half of each mile depending\nwhere the hills were. The course was\nlovely with two castles and lots of nice\ngardens and fields so it felt like no time\nuntil I was onto the last 5 km. With the\nvolunteers shouting great encouragement such as \u201cYou look\u2026 er\u2026 OK!\u201d\nand \u201cYou\u2019re not last!\u201d I jogged home,\neven adding a wobbly sprint finish at\nthe end to clock 8:26. I was tired, but\nI\u2019d had a brilliant day out and I was\nthrilled to have finished the course\nwhich was much tougher, and more\nscenic than I was expecting.\nPit and Nick both had great races\nwith 5:20 and 5:44 finishes, not too far\nbehind the top of the field with eventual winner Karl Alexander setting a\ntime of 04:40:31, and David McNamee\ncoming on 20 seconds after to take\n2nd.\nIC TRIATHLON\nIC 7s steal victory from St George\u2019s\nin 6-5 thriller\nJulian Iacoponi\n7th XI Football Player\nOn Wednesday 30th October, with\nthe chill of Halloween whistling\nthrough the drab skies of autumnal\nLondon, the 7s gathered for what\nturned out to be, appropriately, a\nthriller.\nOur journey to the ground\nmirrored the match in some\nways, but not in others: a long\ntime spent on the tram lines\nseemed appropriate given the\ntennis-like back-and-forth nature\n(and indeed score) of the game,\nalthough the number of stops\nalong that journey did not reflect\nthe equivalent number achieved by\neither defence.\nAfter an unexpectedly\nprofessional warm up \u2013 with extra\nfocus on those key triceps stretches\n\u2013 the team started strongly, with\nMyles Jarvis and Sam \u2018Dzeko\u2019\nDuffield linking up well in attack.\nAn unfortunate non-decision\nby the referee (who conveniently\nwas their player) on a clear down-the-line push on Luke Looney led\nto their first attack of the match,\nwhich, after a sloppily missed\ntackle, led to the first goal. Onelove St. George\u2019s.\nHeads still up, the 7s rallied\nand started to move toward\nthe opposition net with greater\nfrequency and Phil Gantner\nshowing his class in midfield.\nGreat movement from a throw-in\nled to a crisp pass from Phil across\nthe six-yard box for Julian Iacoponi\nto place carefully through the legs\nof the keeper with a firm side-foot\nfinish. One-all, no breaks yet.\nAfter a couple of missed\nchances, complacency set in\nand the opposition began to\ndominate proceedings, bouncing\nback well. Again, a set of poorly\nmissed tackles led to a (legitimate\nthis time) penalty, which the St.\nGeorge\u2019s striker aced passed the\npalms of 7s keeper Zain \u2018Dodgeball\u2019\nAbbas. Perhaps such ball-dodging\npractice didn\u2019t come in handy in\nthis situation? A few minutes later,\nslack marking off a corner led to\ntheir centre-back \u2013 one of those\nmen who look more at home in a\npub than on a football pitch \u2013 who\nheaded in. At 3-1 for St. George\u2019s,\nthe 7s needed to buck the trend\nand break back.\nSome strong tackles by Phil\n\u2018Gersty\u2019 Gerstenberg at right-back\nsparked the team back on track:\ntiming the ball well and challenging\ncleanly, with Vivek Dava in midfield\nasserting himself on the match. The\never-reliable Phil Gantner struck a\nlovely through-ball to Myles Jarvis\u2019\npiercing cross-pitch run, which\nwas followed by a slotted finish. 3-2\ndown at halftime, we had broken\nback and were eager to serve up\nthat equaliser, and then some.\nAt the change of ends \u2013 all triceps\ncrucially still intact \u2013 player-manager-captain Jamie Goodier,\nwho was just a piece of chewing\ngum away from emulating the\nclassic SAF look, sporting a thick\nblack coat; made no substitutions,\nwith the only change coming in the\nreferee position- a role appointed\nto a reluctant but gallant Rob \u2018The\nFresher\u2019 Harris.\nThe second period frenzied\ninto an abuse-gargling affair;\ntreacherous tackles teetering\non the terminal were scattered\nfrom the two teams, elevating the\ntemperature of this testing t\u00eate\u00e0-t\u00eate from moderate to intense.\nSebastian Gosden certainly\ndeserves acclaim for his positively\nEtonian attitude to abuse he\nreceived as linesman: \u201cPlease\ngentlemen, you\u2019re all simply\nembarrassing yourselves\u201d \u2013 indeed\nit could not have been phrased\nmore elegantly.\nAlmost every decision caused\ncontroversy, with St. George\u2019s\nfeeling \u2018robbed\u2019 by the referee\nwhen a penalty was awarded \u2013\nlegitimately \u2013 for handball off an\nattacking Luke Looney header, a\ngreat spot by the hawkeyed fresher.\nMyles Jarvis stepped up to take it,\nbut after sliding the ball weakly\ntoward the middle of the goal\u2026 he\nscored. As previously mentioned,\nthere were indeed very few stops in\nthis game.\nThree-all, the game back on\nserve, we began to serve up some\nimproved football ourselves. Matt\nTaylor moving into centre-back\nprovided stability. A slick one-two move between Dzeko and\nJulian sliced open the St. George\u2019s\ndefence, with a Van Persie-esque\nleft foot boom into the near top\ncorner from the 4th team first-year\nbanking the seventh goal, ever-crucial in any football match as\nevery fan must know.\n4-3 up and with Matt Taylor\nmoving into the referee position,\nthe 7\u2019s standard dropped again,\nwith the sloppiness from early in the\nfirst half returning. A couple of close\ncalls in defence, including a goal-line\nblock from Kingson Opasina, only\ndelayed the inevitable St. George\u2019s\nequaliser.\nAt 4-4, the game again turned,\nwith its end-to-end nature almost\nironically not actually coming to an\nend. A cleanly struck ball from Julian\ninto the feet of Myles resulted in a\nslow toe-poke attempt toward the\ngoalkeeper. Vitally, this shot was at\nleast on target, and with the keeper\u2019s\nattempt at a save horrifically feeble,\nit trickled in. Trick or treat? This was\ncertainly a treat.\nThe standard again fell from the\n7s, with the opposition\u2019s best player\ntaking matters into his own hands\n(or should I say feet?). Their stellar\nno.4 ran around four less stellar 7s,\nand scored with a cultured cross-goal finish. Five-all- this match\nneeded a tiebreaker.\nWith the game deteriorating\nin quality faster than a Kingson\n100m, Myles again stepped up after\nsome neat interplay with Julian\non the left wing and provided a\nthreatening cross toward the back\npost. A looming Luke Looney, who\nlaboured nobly all game, launched\nhimself towards the ball and lashed\nthe header towards goal. The lax\ngoalkeeper had little hope as he\ngropedattheair,leavingtheballlying\nin the net and the 7s in the driver\u2019s\nseat (despite not actually having\na qualified minibus driver). With\nthe score at 6-5, and the tiebreaker\nswinging our way, the final whistle\nblew. Game, set and match.\nAll triceps still nice and limber, we\nshook hands with the opposition,\nand thanked the numerous referees.\nA hard fought war of a game\nbehind us, Nandos and ACC night\nawaited to reward the battle-weary\n#SocialSevens.

With teams\ncoming from as far as Glasgow, the\npressure was on to make it down in\ntime for the Friday night party. With\nthe fastest, most efficient rush hour\navoidance scheme in club history, we\nmade record time out of London and\nwere encountering new and exciting\nforms of debauchery by midnight.\nOn Saturday morning, there was a\nperfect beginner wind. We sent our\nbeginners out to join the 156 newbies\nhitting the water for the first time,\naccompanied by the club instructors\nto supervise, for what must be the\nbiggest mass lesson in the UK!\nFollowing a quick simulator session,\nthe beginners went out in force\nand were soon sailing up and down\nbrilliantly with only a few tows back\nupwind. As the afternoon wore on,\nthe wind began to build and build. We\nrigged our sails and got down to the\nbeach in short order, with every single\nclub member making it out onto the\nwater. Beginner Sam, who headed\nstraight back out onto the water,\ndespite the massive wind, to hone his\nskills,showedparticularlystrongform.\nIn the meantime, the intermediates\ncontinued to push themselves, leading\nto several rescues and some epic kit\nbreakages! Exhausted but happy, we\nwere shooed off the water and headed\nback to the campsite.\nOnce there, the fancy dress madness\nbegan. The overall theme for the party\nwas Jury Summons as it was AK12.\nHaving considered and discarded\ngoing as snowmen (\u201cJust ice!\u201d) on the\nbasis that we\u2019d have been explaining it\nall evening, Imperial had shot gunned\nthe sub-theme of \u201cThe Mob\u201d and as\nsuch it was an extremely smart bunch\nof trilby-ed, suspendered gangsters\nand molls who weaved their way down\nto the party. Avoiding the Di-Octo\nbong (or not) as character dictated, the\ndancing and caravan hopping began\nand lasted well into the morning.\nBy Sunday morning, excitement had\nreached fever pitch. The Daily Herald\nhad informed us that this would be\nthe windiest day for 25 years (Minibus\nmaster Matt\u2019s mum had texted him\nto be careful driving in the gale force\nwinds) we were ready to hit the lake!\nNursing sore heads, we bossed the\ncaravan clear up before piling into the\nminibus. When we arrived, the gusts\nwere so strong that you could see\nthem raising half-foot ripples across\nthe surface of the lake. Needless to\nsay, \u201cDoctor Extraordinaire\u201d Tom was\nout on the water before we could even\ncomplain about putting on our wet\nwetsuits and he proceeded to blister\nup and down at the most ferocious\nspeed while we watched the pros go\nfrom the shore.\nDefying the forecast, the wind\ncalmed a little in time for the racing.\nSadly, it was still too strong for the\nbeginners to race \u2013 a massive pity\nas our beginners had shown some\nreally considerable progress over\nthe weekend and we had high hopes\nof getting some medal winners!\nProgressing to the team racing, Tom,\nPresident Sam and first-time racer\nIzzy took to the water to show off their\nskills. Despite a dramatic beginning\nwhere a cheeky side attack from\nLiverpool trapped him downwind,\nSam whipped away, leaving the ex-Club President (who abandoned us for\nExeter this year) gasping in his wake.\nTom continued in the same vein,\nbringing us up to a nail-biting second\nplace with an awesome plane out and\na clean gybe.\nUnfortunately, Izzy was unable to\nhold position following an unlucky\ngybe and we finished in a still-respectable fifth place. As the clouds\nstarted to close over, we dragged\nMayliss and Will off the water and\npacked up to head home, refreshed\nand rejuvenated after a wonderful\nweekend away.\nSam Cooper\nWindsurfer\nEagles squeak past Royal\nHolloway in close game\nStefan Bauer\nHandball Secretary\nThe Imperial Eagles Handball\nClub has started their new campaign with a hard-fought victory\nover newcomers Royal Holloway\non Saturday, and are now amongst\nthe favourites to win the first ever\nLUSL Handball League.\nOver the summer, all Londonbased University Handball Clubs\nhad put a lot of work into a combined LUSL application in order\nto play amongst like-minded clubs\nand further the whole sports\u2019 application to the BUCS network.\nLast weekend marked the first\nmatch day of the newly established\nLUSL Men\u2019s Handball Division and\nImperial was set to face Royal Holloway for the first time ever.\nAfter a rather long journey to the\nSPORTHOUSE in Barking, a venue that serves as a painful reminder of the failure that is the Olympic\nLegacy, the Eagles saw their opposition for the first time and had\nto come to the realisation that this\ngame would not be the push-over\nthey were expecting for the first\ngame of the season. What Royal\nHolloway was lacking in experi-ence, they more than compensated\nfor with individual class. Their\nfrancophone comrades on the left\nwing and the right back positions\nwould prove to be difficult to control and their counter-attacking\nstyle was very efficient.\nFrom the first attack onwards the\ngame was very heated and hotly\ncontested and after 14 minutes\nplayed, the Eagles found themselves trailing with 7:4 goals, leading to the first team time-out. The\nopponent\u2019s tactical set-up was addressed and spirits were rekindled,\nwhich quickly refocused Imperial\u2019s\nteam and saw them clawing back\ngoal after goal. Some questionable\nrefereeing and some sloppy finishing meant that at half time, the\nEagles found themselves one goal\nbehind their opponents at 15:14.\nAfter a detailed analysis at halftime and a change in their defensive set-up, which saw Royal Holloway\u2019s dangerous right-handed\nwinger cut-off or alternatively the\nleft-back man marked in order to\nslow their attacking waves, Imperial finally found their way into the\ngame. The goal deficit was quickly\nturned into a 2-goal lead and with\nStefan Bauer in goal finally finding his form, Royal Holloway soon\nfound themselves trailing by 4\ngoals.\nA highly debatable call by the referee saw Imperials\u2019 David HoSchmi sent off with 20minutes to play\nand threw the hosts from north\nLondon a life-line. However, unlike\nin previous years, the Eagles kept\ntheir cool, continued to be clinical\nin front of goal and held on to their\nlead. Royal Holloway tried to open\ntheir little box of tricks, but their\nattempts to unnerve Imperial were\nto no avail. After 60 minutes the\nfinal score was 27:29 for Imperial.\nClub President Rishi De-Kayne\nwas ecstatic after the encounter:\n\u201cWhat an exciting game! This is\nwhy we went through all the trouble of setting up the Uni League. It\u2019s\ngreat to play competitive matches\nagainst teams with the same standard and mindset. Admittedly, this\nwas a very close game, but everyone in the team really worked hard\nand stayed focused when it mat-tered. If we keep playing like this, I\nfancy our chances this season.\u201d\nICU HANDBALL\nICU WINDSURFING\nICU\nWINDSURFING\n\n"

This is partly\nbecause they recruit in volume and\nas a result have budgets to spend on\nmarketing their opportunities and\nraising their profile on campus. But\nthey are not the only option and in fact\nthe data shows that, nationally, more\ngraduates obtain their first job with an\nSME than with a major corporate. So\nlet\u2019s investigate the pros and cons of\nwhat might be right for you.\nWhat do we mean by an SME?\nIn a recent survey of undergraduates\n36% of UK students reported that they\ndid not know what an SME was. There\nis some debate about what constitutes\nan SME and the definition varies\nacross countries and continents but\ngeneral in Europe the three broad\nparameters can be defined as:\n\u2022 Micro-entities are\ncompanies with up to 10 employees\n(often but not always Start-Ups)\n\u2022 Small companies with up to\n50 workers\n\u2022 Medium-sized companies\nhave up to 250 employees.\nThe Association of Graduate\nRecruiters (AGR) annual survey of\ngraduate vacancies typically estimated\napproximately 20,000 opportunities\nprovided by AGR member companies.\nThese are mainly, although not\nexclusively large employers who\nrecruit in volume so there is a big\ngap between this and the number\nof graduates each year. Out of the\n300,000 or so undergraduate students\nwho graduate in the UK each year\nonly about 10% will obtain work in a\nFTSE100 company so it makes sense to\nassume that many more graduates are\nfinding work in smaller organisations.\nWorking for an SME - the\nPros?\nSMEs often work on a different\nrecruitment cycle to large corporates.\nIt is more common for them to\nrecruit on an \u2018as required\u2019 basis so\nopportunities can appear throughout\nthe year with more immediate\nstart times. This is a benefit for\nthose who wish to delay their job\nhunting until the spring or summer\nwhen many of the deadlines have\npassed for larger companies. SMEs\nmay have a structured application\nprocess but often they are open to\na direct speculative approach too.\nThis can work particularly well for\nthose interested in internships. Also\nSMEs are perhaps more open to\ninternship applications from earlier\nyear groups and not always restricting\nopportunities to penultimate year\nstudents.\nBecause SMEs have fewer\nemployees you can expect to work in a\nclose knit, perhaps more collaborative\nenvironment with possibly more\naccess to senior management than in\nlarger organisations as it is common\nfor managers in smaller companies\nto be more involved in the day to\nday operation of the company. You\nmay find a more open and supportive\natmosphere with less hierarchy. In a\nsmallerorganisationyourcontribution\nmay be much more visible which can\nallow you to feel a greater sense of\nachievement and recognition of your\nwork, helping you feel more engaged\nwith the aims of the company. Smaller\norganisations may also provide a\nmore flexible working environment\nwith opportunities to work across\ndifferent projects and to determine\nyour trajectory within the company.\nThe companies tend by their nature\nto be more agile and fast moving and\nso can be a great experience in fast\ntracking your career but you need to\ndevelop resilience and self-confidence\nto ensure that you keep up and seize\nthe benefits.\nBut what are the cons?\nThe slightly less formal structure\nmight not suit everyone. If you\nare hoping for a well-defined role\nand clear cut route for your career\nthen an SME might not suit you.\nUnlike larger companies who recruit\nsubstantial cohorts of graduates at\none time you may find you are the\nonly new graduate working for a\nsmall company. As such it will be up\nto you to establish yourself and plan\nfor your training and development\nin a more proactive way than on an\nestablished graduate scheme. This\ndoes not mean that you will not get\nthe support you need and in fact it\nmight be more personally tailored but\nthere is no doubt that you will have to\ntake more responsibility for making\nthe most of any opportunities. Unlike\nlarger graduate schemes where you\nmay well have set rotations around\ndifferent departments and your\nexperience determined for the first\none to two years in an SME it will be\nmore likely that you need to network\nwith colleagues to gain opportunities\nto develop your experience. This\napproach suits some but not all so\nthink through what you will be most\ncomfortable with.\nAnother slight downside is that\nsmaller companies are more likely to\nhave a less structured salary package\nso again you may need to take the\ninitiative in establishing how and\nwhen your pay will be reviewed. If\nyou prove your worth and have the\nconfidence then this need not be a\ndisadvantage and in fact could lead to\nbigger earnings in the long run.\nHow do you find the\ncompanies?\nSMEs are far less likely to make a\nsplash on campus but they are there\nand just take a little more effort to\nseek out. Even at the big careers\nfairs you will be surprised how many\nof the companies attending fall into\nthe SME category, particularly in\nthe Technology sector where SMEs\nabound. JobsLive is a good starting\npoint where more than half of the\n7300 companies registered employ\nless than 250 staff and just over 3000\nhave under fifty employees.\nThere are also two useful sections\non the Careers Service website on\nhow to research companies and links\nto resources:\nimperial.ac.uk/careers/ug/research\nimperial.ac.uk/careers/resources/\nweblinks/researchjobs/companies\nWhat about Start Ups?\nStart Ups by definition tend to\nbe small businesses. Some remain\nsmall and some grow into giants and\nmany familiar names have followed\nthis trajectory in recent years. Start\nUps can be a great experience for\nsome but they are possibly not for\nthe risk averse among us. If you\nare interested in developing your\nentrepreneurial skills and learning\nhow a business develops then being\nin at the start with a company can\nbe hugely rewarding. Consider what\nyou have to offer a Start Up company.\nIs it business acumen, technical\nknowledge, a specific practical skill\nor work experience background? Also\nthink through what they have to offer\nyou in terms of career development,\nskills and knowledge enhancement\nand reward. Be cautious of the Equity\nShare only offer with no basic salary.\nThis is common among Start Ups and\nis a particularly risky proposition. You\nmay feel that it is worth the gamble\nand of course for some the rewards in\nthe long run can be fantastic but also\nconsider the percentage of small Start\nUps who do not survive into their\nsecond or third year. It is perhaps\nsafer to negotiate at least a small basic\nsalary along with some potential for\nshared equity in the longer term. Each\nyear nationally about 4.5% of new\ngraduates set up their own businesses\nimmediately after graduation. This\nis a relatively small percentage and\npossibly reflects the fact that although\nmany graduates harbour the thought\nof being their own boss most feel it\nis safer to gain some experience of\nthe business world at someone else\u2019s\nexpense first before launching into\nself-employment. Getting involved\nin business competitions and\nentrepreneurial student challenges is\na good way to test out your aptitude\nfor developing a business. Details of\nbusiness challenges notified to us at\nImperial can be found at:\nimperial.ac.uk/careers/ug/\ncompetitions\nSome challenges may also be notified\ndirect to your department.

    "content": "24 FRIDAY 08 NOV\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNashville: Season 2\nIt\u2019s country music y\u2019all!\nJohn Park Television Editor\nIn a battle for the top of the country\ncharts, let the cat-fights commence\nbetween an older living legend who is\nstruggling to keep up with the evolving music industry, and a younger,\nfresh-faced new star who is experiencing success as a crossover artist between country and pop to a huge teenage fan-base. Rayna James (Connie\nBritton) is the older one, Juliet Barnes\n(Hayden Panettiere) is the younger\none, and together they headline Nashville, a rather inconsistent soap opera\ndressed up all nice and pretty in the\ngood original soundtrack that tries to\ncarry the clunky series along.\nThe focus on the music industry\nis the upside of the show. Even for\nthose not familiar with country mu-sic, a good mixture set list of both\nupbeat, cheerful songs, to the slower\nballads, is enough to win over new\nfans. What the characters sing about\nare highly limited, as is the case with\nthe country music genre in general\n- driving trucks, drinking beer/whis-key and love, mostly heartache. The\ncast members tasked with singing\na lot of the original songs all handle\nthem beautifully. Britton and Panettiere both have strong voices as well as\ncharisma and stage presence in their\nflashy music scenes, and it\u2019s certainly\nrefreshing for a musical drama where\nits protagonists don\u2019t randomly break\nout into a song-and-dance routine to\nthrow their worries away. These people aren\u2019t misguided, delusional highschool teens, they seem more like real\nindividuals with deep-rooted problems that need addressing.\nContributing to the music scenery\nare season 1 characters who make a\nwelcome comeback, as well as some\nnew talent that shows promise. Scarlett O\u2019Connor (Clare Bowen) and\nGunnar Scott (Sam Palladio) have\nbroken up; Scarlett is on a potential\nroad to stardom, having been taken\nunder Rayna\u2019s wings and her record\nlabel, although the glamorous, pub-licity-heavy side of the industry is\noften too much to handle for a girl\nwho started out singing in a small cafe\nwhilst waitressing. Gunnar has been\nless lucky: he\u2019s continuing to write\nsongs although it\u2019s a challenge to get\nback on his feet after such heartbreak.\nHe finds an unlikely ally in Avery Barkley (Jonathan Jackson), Scarlett\u2019s ex,\nand the two of them bond over writing and performing, which provides\nan interesting angle on a newly forming bromance. They used to absolutely\nhate each other - but it would appear\ntheir new common ground of loving\nto perform will bring them closer.\nNew faces for season 2 include Will\nLexington (Chris Carmack), Gunnar\u2019s\nhouse-mate who could make quite an\nimpact on the country charts, as long\nas he keeps his homosexuality hidden and keeps working the ladies on\nstage, and Zoey Dalton (Chaley Rose),\nScarlett\u2019s childhood friend who sings\ngospel music, who also has the hots\nfor Gunnar. all have incredible voices\nand they only get better as they sing\nas duets forming beautiful harmonies.\nLet\u2019s not forget about Deacon Claybourne (Charles Esten) who we left\noff in the season 1 finale embroiled\nin a drunken fight with his on-again,\noff-again lover Rayna before getting\ninvolved in a car accident. Rayna was\ndriving, Deacon was distracting with\nher boozy antics which caused the\ncrash. His hand is badly damaged,\nwhich means he needs to say goodbye to music career and his extensive\nguitar collection. That revelation concerning the paternity of one of Rayna\u2019s\ndaughters shocks and naturally turns\nhis world upside down, although he\u2019s\na big enough man to concede that he\u2019s\nprobably not the best father-figure the\nyoung girl could have.\nRayna\u2019s sister, Tandy Hampton (Ju-dith Hoag) is also starting to have a\nmore prominent role in the show, as\nher loyalties are tested when it comes\nto uncovering the mysteries behind a\na car accident that killed her mother.\nWas there foul play? And if so, by\nwhom?\nJuliet thinks she\u2019s got it all - this is\nuntil she gets a dose of her own medi-cine, as yet another new emerging star\nthreatens to undermine her success\nand credibility as an artist who can\ntruly appeal to the teen market. The\never-changing nature of the music\nindustry, as well as its need to be cutthroat and ruthless is played out well\nthrough Juliet\u2019s character more in season 2 than how Rayna\u2019s struggle was\nhandled in season 1. Layla Grant (Au-brey Peeples), a runner-up of a singing\ncompetition, seems to be the talking\npoint of Edgehill Records and its CEO\nJeff Fordham (Oliver Hudson) which\ncould potentially derail Juliet\u2019s tour\nand album sales. Given how much of\na class A maniuplative bitch that she\nwas back in season 1, you might think\nit would be easy to feel no sympathy\nfor the character. But Juliet has a painful past to tell, and there are softer\nsides to her otherwise driven, ambitious nature which have the tendency\nto help you look past her icy persona.\nVulnerability reaches Rayna too, as\nthe aforementioned car accident that\nDeacon was involved in also affects\nher. Placed in intensive care, thankfully it doesn\u2019t take long for her to\nmake a comeback, although questions\nare raised as to whether she\u2019ll ever be\nable to sing live again, with a rousing\nanswer provided on the excellent closing scene of episode 5.\nAs if the show wasn\u2019t crowded\nenough, we also get a peek into the\npolitics of Nashville, Tennessee. Rayna\u2019s soon-to-be ex-husband Teddy\nConrad (Eric Close) is now the mayor\ndetermined to run a clean office although there is pressure from Rayna\u2019s\nwealthy, powerful father Lamar (the\nexcellent, excellent, Powers Boothe\nwhose deep, growly voice is still as\nmenacing and authoritative as ever) to\ndo things his way. Along with Teddy\nthere is a subplot that is headed for\ndisaster as his girlfriend/mistress\nPeggy Kenter (Kimberley WilliamsPaisley) claims that she\u2019s pregnant although she\u2019s clearly not. This tiresome\nstrand better resolve itself quickly, as\nany soapy drama that distracts from\nthe music is one that needs to quickly\ngo away.\nSpeaking of needless drama, the romantic side of the series is the major\ndownfall. It\u2019s inevitable that everyone\nstarts to have feelings for everyone\nelse, but there is too much moody\nsulking around to create any compelling couples to root for. Not everyone\ngels as an ensemble at the moment,\nand there is an odd lack of narrative\nstrength and continuity in certain\nepisodes that makes the show seem\nsporadic and its structure, a mess. So\nfar everyone is pretty much single, but\nthis will no doubt all change come the\nmid-season episodes.\nBut it\u2019s worth sticking around for\nthe Britton and Pannettiere duo alone.\nAlthough the two characters aren\u2019t\npitted against each other as much as\nyou\u2019d hope, even as individuals they\nare able to compel and move.\n\n"

As I read L\u2019etranger \u2013 usually\ntranslated as either The Stranger or The\nOutsider \u2013 a similar atmosphere appeared to surround me, created by Albert Camus to accompany his \u2018stranger\u2019\nthrough the absurd trap lying in wait\nfrom the very first page.\nA man \u2013 surname Meursault \u2013 notes\nthe death of his mother with the words\n\u201cAujoud\u2019 hui, maman est mort. Ou peut\netre hier, je ne sais pas\u201d \u2013 something\nlike \u201cToday, mother is dead. Or it could\nbe yesterday, I\u2019m not sure\u201d \u2013 in these famous opening lines.\nThe man\u2019s detachment only becomes\nmore evident as the novel progresses.\nHis life is lived through an intense appreciation of what might be called life\u2019s\nsimple pleasures: watching the progression and procession of an entire afternoon from his window, desiring his girlfriend when she wears a read and white\nstriped dress or swimming in the waves\non a sultry day. He is not unappreciative\nof company but rather seems able to derive only a very superficial feeling from\nit; this is more than sufficient for him.\nIn many ways, he could be described\n\u2013 and I imagine a Daily Mail headline\nwould \u2013 as cold and soulless\u2026 in short,\na stranger to \u2018normal\u2019 human feeling \u2013 a\ndevil.\nMeursault\u2019s powers of observation are\nimmense; he takes careful and precise\nnotice of his surroudings and actions,\noften noting bizarre occurrences of human behaviour. He also tries to understand himself and his motivations, however simple they may appear to us. Most\nEva Rosenthal\nBooks editor\nChortle Festival\nComes to London\nThe British comedy website Chortle has announced\nits first comedy book festival \u2013 which will take place\nin Ealing at the end of this month. The festival will\nopen with a stand up gala in Ealing Town Hall, featuring hit comedians including Richard Herring and\nShappi Khorsandi. This opening event will be hosted\nby Logan Murray, known for his appearances in TV\nshows such as Peep Show, Packet of Three and Pebble\nMill.\nOther events include Robert Finn\u2019s talk on how to\nturn debut novels into bestsellers and Rob Newman\u2019s\ndiscussion on the trade secrets of Elizibethan England. Imperial alumnus Dr Simon Singh will present\na lecture about the mathematical secrets of Matt\nGroening\u2019s hit TV shows The Simpsons and Futurama. Jack Whitehall, star of hit shows Fresh Meat\nand Bad Education, will also join his father to discuss\ntheir recently released book Him & Me \u2013 which explores their unusual family relationship.\nTickets range in price from \u00a35 to \u00a320 per event and\nplaces are limited so interested people are interested\nto book early.\nFor more information and to buy tickets for the individual events visit comedybookfest.com .\nFlash Fiction\nby Laurence Pope\nThe King watches his empire crumble under a tide of darkness. Ivory towers toppled,\nholy men slain. His fair Queen, crushed under mighty hooves. Cornered and alone he\nthrows down his crown. Checkmate.\nJack and Michael Whitehall\ninteresting to me however, is the complete lack of judgement he demonstrates\ntowards the choices made by others,\nsomething which resonates especially\nin the currently fashionable \u2018non-judgemental\u2019 trend of allowing people to live\ntheir lives \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 as they\nwant.\nOn a day of glaring sunlight, walking\nalong a beach, the \u2018stranger\u2019 enters a\nsemi-delirious state and with the evening coming on, shoots and kills a name-less, although menacing, man. Then, for\nno apparent reason, he shoots a further\nfour bullets into the dead man\u2019s body.\nMeursault is subsequently jailed, under-standably.\nHis trial however, is an absurd night-mare, that proceeds in any case, with a\nsense of the utmost normalcy.\nThe prosecutor, who initially likes\nMeursault, takes a sudden and very personal aversion to the \u2018stranger\u2019s\u2019 disbelief\nin God. From then onwards, Meursault\u2019s\ndestiny \u2013 the guillotine \u2013 becomes en-trenched. The courthouse is merely a\nzoo and Meursault an encaged animal,\njudged mostly on the lack of emotion he\nshowed at his mother\u2019s funeral.\nIt is moreover an incredibly human\nand moving. The last four pages espeL\u2019etranger for the centenary of Camus\u2019 birth\nAlbert Camus with accompanying non-PC cigarette\ncially, read like the explosion into light\nof a human brain. Meursault\u2019s acceptance of his fate and of the absurdity of\nall human life and relationships is condensed into these truly powerful pages.\nHis life, or rather his death, is a certainty\nand there is nothing left to do but take\npleasure from the warm summer night\nand the stars, open for the \u201cfirst time\nto the tender indifference of the world\u201d\n(loosely translated from \u201cje m\u2019ouvrais\npour la premiere fois a la tendre indifference du monde\u201d).\nL\u2019etranger is a book that tilts our understanding of human souls and their\nmyriad forms, of the way in which we\nare unable to accept anything beyond\nour narrow view of the world. Meursault\n\u2013 a stranger in his society \u2013 is cold by\nsome measure. But what meausure are\nwe using? Who are we to judge? In 2013\nit seems adequate to pose these ques-tions. I think Camus poses these and\nmany, and more complex, questions in\nhis L\u2019etranger.\nL\u2019etranger by Albert Camus, Editions Gallimard 1942\nThe Outsider by Albert Camus in a new\ntranslation by Sandra Smith, Penguin\nClassics 2013\n\n"

Last year they raised over \u00a345,000\nand this year they hope to raise even\nmore, with 100% of profits going to the\npeople who need them most \u2013 with nothing\nsubtracted for administration or overhead costs.\nIt\u2019s hard to appreciate the scale on which this\noccurs \u2013 universities across the world, from\nAustralia to Canada take part, and 14 universities\nfrom London alone. Usman Siddiqui is this year\u2019s\nLondon coordinator, and one of our very own\nmedics. He explains that the money is allocated\nto projects that are voted on by the volunteers\nat a national round-up dinner. Last year projects\nincluded rebuilding schools damaged by flooding\nin Pakistan, treating 3000 malnourished children\nin Somalia and providing vocational training for\norphans in Kenya.\nObviously some might be worried that\nfundraising through a religious body could lead\nto discrimination, on both ends. However, the\norganisers make very clear that this will not be\nan issue \u2013 both Muslims and non-Muslims help\nto run the events, and the funding is allocated\nwithout any religious considerations. The only\nlimitation is that the money must be spent on\nhelping orphans or otherwise needy children,\nwhich seems sensible enough.\nThe most incredible thing about charity week\nis perhaps the way in which it is run. Islamic\nRelief, one of the charities that makes up the UK\u2019s\nDisasters Emergency Committee, provides all\nthe materials needed for the week so that none\nof the donations are spent on overheads, and\nhandles all the financials. In the ten years that\nCharity Week has been running, they have raised\nover \u00a32 million and have managed to orchestrate\nthis entire endeavour without overheads and\nwithout paying any staff salaries, which I think\nis absolutely amazing. What\u2019s more, they didn\u2019t\neven set out with the intention of raising as\nmuch money as possible, rather just uniting their\nyounger members under some worthwhile cause.\nlondon.uk@onecharityweek.com\nDo you recognise this band logo?

    "content": "4 FRIDAY 08 NOV\nNEWS\nEditors: Aemun Reza,\nNida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhe Great Hall at Imperial\nplayed host to the second\nbiannual People\u2019s Question\nTime, an opportunity for\nmembers of the public\nto interact directly with the Mayor\nand the London Assembly. Over 700\npeople attended the event, with many\nbeing members of the public that live\nin the Kensington and Chelsea area.\nThe evening started with an\nintroduction from Darren Johnson,\nChair of the London Assembly,\nfollowed by a lively speech from\nthe Boris himself featuring his\ncharacteristic humour and dubious\nstatistics about the advances he had\nmade since making office in 2008.\nAccording to the man himself, he\nhas cut delays on the tube by 40% (\u201cOr\napparently [as this is] what TFL tell\nme\u201d) and his 8% crime cut is enough\nto claim London is now the safest\ncities in Europe, if not the world. He\nalso credited London for the immense\nexport trading that we provide,\nheartily including Piers Morgan\u2019s\nexportation to America.\nThat\u2019s not to say all members of\nthe crowd warmed to his humour.\nThroughout the evening as topics\nsuch as transport, planning\nand development, housing and\nregeneration were discussed, hecklers\nconstantly shouted above what Boris\nwas trying to explain, and other\nmembers of the crowd often were\nleft shushing the more rowdier of the\nmembers of the public.\nFire Station Closure\nOne topic in particular evoked a\nvery strong response from some of the\naudience, and this was concerning the\nclosure of the fire stations across the\ncapital. Plans to shut 10 fire stations\nand axe 550 jobs was approved by the\nLondon Fire and Emergency Planning\nAuthority (LFEPA) in early September\nof this year, causing considerable\ndistress to those in the boroughs\neffected.\nAssembly Member James Cleverly,\nchairman of the LFEPA, supported\nthis decision although the Fire\nBrigades Union (FBU) is currently\nconsidering challenging the decision.\nCleverly, when explaining the cuts,\nsaid that they were in response to\nthe significant reduction in fire risk,\nand Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson\n(who was not present) has already\nstated how response times will remain\namong the best in the UK.\nOne woman delivered a rather\nemotive speech to the Mayor over\nthe decision, deploring the idea that\nhe was using his humour and charm\nto mask the decisions he was making\nthat could potentially jeopardise\nthe lives of her, her family and the\nrest of his community. However\nthere seems there is no turning back\non the motion, with the measures\ncoming into effect next January and\nstations closing including those that\nservice Knightsbridge, Westminster,\nWoolwich in Greenwich and Belsize\nin Camden.\nAccommodation\nStudents at Imperial also took the\nchance to voice their views, with one\nstudent asking about implementing\ncontrols over the private\naccommodation sector, especially\nconcerning landlords that \u201ctake\nadvantage\u201d of the students looking to\nrent properties for the first time.\nWith a quarter of all Londoners\nrenting from private landlords, Boris\nmaking a decision about this would\ncertainly be in the interests of millions\nof people across the city, although he\nhas decided to take a stance not to\ninterfere.\nHe stated that although it is \u201cvital\nto continue to build more affordable\nhomes,\u201d capping the rent prices\nwould not be happening in the near\nfuture. He stated that there is still\nthe Voluntary Accredited Landlord\nscheme that should be ensuring that\nthe rights of the tenants are upheld,\nbut explained that he \u201ccannot reduce\nvalues of housing stock under the laws\nof supply and demand.\u201d More houses\nare needed to reduce rent prices as\nopposed to setting caps on rent prices\nof existing properties.\nEarl\u2019s Court renovation plans:\nThe Earl\u2019s Court Project\nThe renovation plans in the Earl\u2019s\nCourt area was also discussed, with\nmembers of the public voicing their\ndisbelief over the benefits to the\ndemolition of the exhibition centre\nand 760 homes in the neighbouring\nWest Kensington and Gibbs Green\ncouncil estates. Boris approved plans\nfor the 77-acre redevelopment scheme\nin July, called the Earl\u2019s Court Project,\nmuch to the displeasure of the rest of\nthe assembly who called the decision\n\u201cappalling.\u201d\nNicky Gavron of the assembly from\nthe Labour party, implored members\nof the public to \u201cGo on with your\ncampaigning,\u201d as the renovation plans\nare still not a done deal. With the new\nplans to include 6,000 new luxury\napartments, the audience argued that\nthe redevelopments did not include\noptions for affordable housing.\nThe London Living Wage\nWith Boris increasing this by 25p\nto \u00a38.55 this week, this was also on\nthe agenda. The wage is considered\nto be the minimum people should be\npaid per hour to cover the basic cost\nof living in the capital, although it is\nmore of a recommendation than a\nrequirement with only five councils\nof the 32 London boroughs currently\nsigned up to the scheme.\nBoris praised the scheme, explaining\nthat it increases \u201cloyalty [among\nworkers]\u201d and delivers an acceptable\nstandard of living for the people\nof London. No-one enquired as to\nwhether Boris was aware of Imperial\nCollege directly employing 699 people\nwho are paid below the LLW, although\nthis was probably because the crowd\nwas still expending valuable energy in\ncalling him a \u2018wanker\u2019.\nTravelling around London\nBuses were also on the agenda, with\none man enquiring as to why buses\nwere constantly running down his\nroad of residence empty, including a\nstudent favourite, the number 52. On\nthisBorisexplainedhowunfortunately\nthere is no \u201cgreat big bus Valhalla\u201d for\nbuses to \u201crecuperate in\u201d after running\nduring peak travelling times, so they\nare left circulating under capacity.\nIt is undecided as to whether or\nnot this warranted the man shouting\nin response that Boris himself is a\n\u201cwaste of space,\u201d although considering\nthe other, less imaginative heckles he\nreceived, was certainly not the only\nperson to feel animosity towards the\nLondon Mayor during the evening.\nOne member of the public\nenquired as to whether there will\nbe an introduction of greater safety\nmeasures to the cycle lanes after\naccidents have left cyclists injured,\noccasionally fatally. However students\nwho do cycle criticised the discussion,\nsaying not enough was resolved\nor disclosed to the public about\nimproving the lives of cyclists.\nBoris did state that \u201cso many people\n[jostled] me as I was cycling through\nHolborn. Maybe they had a point\nto make, \u201d alluding to the idea that\npeople may be taking out their anger\nat the Mayor using the very bikes that\nare colloquially named after him.\nThe overall atmosphere of the\ndiscussion was rather tense, with\naudience members being very vocal\nabout the issues that they were\nconcerned about. However, the\nevening ran smoothly, and it was\nencouraging to see members of the\npublic getting involved with the\ndecisions that would affect their lives,\neven if it did seem that the outcome of\nsome of the more audacious proposals\nare looking rather bleak for some.\nThe next People\u2019s Question Time\nwill be held after the New Year.\nPeople\u2019s Question Time\nPhilippa Skett\nNews Editor\nTop: Boris answering questions during the meeting.

JOSEPH LETTS\nA\nnew postgraduate\nstudent and staff\ndrinking and social\nvenue on the South\nKensington campus\nis set to open this Friday. In keeping\nwith the Union\u2019s trend of naming\nits drinking establishments with\nincredibly nerdy puns, the new\nspace will be called \u0127 (pronounced\nh-bar), named after the reduced\nPlanck constant, which is the smallest\nquantum of angular momentum (with\na value of 6.582 x 10-16 eV s). There\nhave been some criticisms of the\nnew name, however according to the\nUnion the name was chosen out of a\nshortlist of names submitted by staff\nmembers and postgraduate students.\nThe \u0127 will be a multi-function space,\nwith a \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019 area and a \u2018bar\u2019 area.\nThe bar will be run by the Union,\nwhilst food is provided by College\u2019s\nCampus Services division. The bar\nwill be staffed by students with\nprevious bar experience, similar to\nthe Old Holland Club and will have\nseveral student shift leaders, one of\nwhom will be Stefan Nubert, former\nDeputy President Finance & Services\nand current Imperial postgraduate\nstudent. The caf\u00e9 area is set to serve\nLeon -style street food \u2014 think falafel\nwraps and couscous \u2014 which adds an\nexciting variation to College\u2019s current\nfood provision, while the bar area\nwill provide pub-style food as well\nas sharing platters and tapas-style\ndishes. The lunch provided by the\nvenue will be different from the menu\nin the Senior Common Room, with\nthe added benefit of being accessible\nfor taught postgraduate students\n(unlike the SCR). The bar will serve a\nselection of beverages available at the\nother Union bars, with the addition\nof a new craft beer from Greene King\ncalled \u201cNoble\u201d. There might also be\nsome promotional deal available later\non in the year.\nThe Union stated that they were\nkeen for the space to host postgraduate\nstudent events and welcome student\ninput while the way in which the\nspace is used is developed. They are\nalso keen for postgraduate students to\nconsider \u0127 as a \u201chome for postgraduate\nstudents and staff\u201d.\nIn comparison to the postgraduate\nand staff venue that used to exist in the\nspace (the Holland bar) the \u0127 provides\na significantly large space for drinking\nand eating, utilising more of the\nSherfield building\u2019s basement spaces.\nAdditionally the availability of food\nduring lunch hours has the potential\nto reduce the stress on the popular\nSCR, which currently operates at\nfull capacity during this period. The\nbiggest boost to functionality from the\nrefit is the opening up of the space in\nthe sub-basement below Sherfield and\n\u0127. This has created two activity spaces/\nmeeting rooms for union clubs and\nsocieties, which were in desperately\nshort supply. Unfortunately this\nhas come at the expense of the staff\nsnooker room, but given the desperate\nlack of space on campus and the large\nsnooker room on the top floor of the\nUnion, this did seem redundant.\nMatthew Allinson\nReporter\nSay Hello to the\nGoogle Nexus 5 27\nGraduate Students Union\nThe GSU page is here\n31\nPick a size\nWhich company size is\nright for you\n35\n\n"

On the non-academic side, you can look forward to a range of\nfun events spaced regularly throughout the year:\na monthly pub quiz, movie nights and discounted\ntheatre trips are only a small sample of what you\ncan expect. These will always be well advertised\nhere in Felix, on our Facebook page and our\nnewsletter \u2013 so keep an eye out for anything\nwhich may interest you!\nHowever, a great student experience cannot be\nobtained solely through social opportunities.\nIt means having no extra worries at work, and\nsomeone to turn to should things go bad. We want\nto ensure that you get the same opportunities, the\nsame representation, no matter whether you are\nbased at South Kensington or any other of the\nmanyImperialCampuses.Yourvoiceisimportant,\nand we will endeavour to make it heard loud and\nclear on all relevant College committees; because\nwe can only remain one of the best universities\nin the world if we protect the student experience\nfrom being sacrificed for pure academic success.\nI look forward to seeing you at one of our events!\nAndreas Thomik\nGSU President\nP.S. Keep Saturday 7th December free for this\nyear\u2019s Post Grad Christmas Party! There will\nbe mulled wine, mince pies and snow! Wear a\nChristmassy jumper and come celebrate with\nus. Location and more details to be announced\nshortly - keep an eye on your emails.\nO\nn the 21st December of\nlast year, the much beloved\nHolland Club in the\nbasement of the Sherfield\nbuilding closed its doors for\nthe last time \u2013 to the big disappointment of\nthe numerous postgraduate students and\nmembers of staff who enjoyed having a place\nto have a decently priced pint in walking\ndistance of their lecture theatres and offices.\nA lot of thirsty postgraduate students were\nleft to battle with undergraduates over a\nplace at the counter at FiveSixEight or shell\nout a few extra pounds (and risk running\ninto their supervisor/lecturer) at one of the\npubs around campus.\nThese dark days have now thankfully\ncome to an end.\nAfter 11 months of intense and hard\nwork and unexpected challenges, the space\nformerly occupied by the Holland Club\nhas been completely renovated to become\nh-bar1, the new home for taught and\nresearch postgraduate students and staff\nseeking to unwind after a hard day\u2019s work.\nYesterday\u2019s opening revealed a brand new\nspace with more than twice the capacity of\nthe former Holland Club. New tables, new\nlights, new floor, new counter \u2013 even brand\nnew bathrooms! \u2013 nothing has been left to\nits original state. Some people will certainly\nregret the more classic, typical pub feeling\nof the former bar, but equally many will be\nhappy to see the old carpet gone and a (new)\nventilation system installed.\nTaught postgraduate students have a\nparticular reason to rejoice: in addition to\nthe beer, crisps and pizza offered by the\nformer Holland Club, the new h-bar now has\na fully functional kitchen which will provide\na warm lunchtime service, particularly\naimed at MSc students who had formerly no\ndedicated space to go to. In addition to that,\nthere is a newly refurbished basement with\nactivities areas which students can book free\nof charge to host small events.\nBut of course, what would the h-bar be\nif it didn\u2019t host the Holland Club\u2019s most\nfaithful and regular guest: our monthly\nGSU Pub Quiz, held every last Thursday of\nthe month, which had to take a temporary\nhome in The Union Bar over the past year.\nTo celebrate the opening of the new pub,\nwe are, exceptionally, putting on a special\nedition of our pub quiz two weeks early \u2013\nthat\u2019s next week already! A GSU Christmas\nparty is also planned on the venues early\nDecember. We look forward to seeing you\nall there to thoroughly test the new facilities\nand have a brilliant evening together.\nCheers to that!\nYour GSU Committee 2013/14\n1 Because let\u2019s face it: even at Imperial, no\none was ever going to say \u201cLet\u2019s go for a pint\nat the Reduced Planck Constant Pub\u201d\nA New Place for Postgrads\nThe role of the GSU Academic and Welfare Officers (AWOs) is very similar to the one of your freshly elected course and year Reps, with\nthe difference that they represent their entire faculty\u2019s interests at the College level! If you feel that an issue you have raised may be relevant\nto other courses/departments or is not being properly addressed, get in touch with your AWO! He will know how to best bring the issue\nforward and can leverage the GSU\u2019s strong links to the College\u2019s administration to bring about the changes which matter to you.\nNo clue who your AWO is?

Includes\nstudents-only guided tours by Wallpaper* magazine editors.\nUntil 9th February, \u00a38 students, \u00a312 adults\nH\nigh in the Andean jungle, to\nthe sound of drums, flutes\nand trumpets, \u2018El Dorado\u2019, the\ngolden one, the future king\nof the Muisca tribe, prepares\nto dive into sacred Lake Guatavita.\nCovered from head to toe in gold\ndust, he tosses emeralds into the water\nbelow as an offering to the ethereal\nspirits that reside in everyone and\neverything.\nIt was witnessing ceremonies like this\nthat prompted early Spanish explorers\nto speak of a land so rich in gold that\ntheir cities were almost dripping with\nit. Even now, the idea of El Dorado\nconjures up images in the minds of\nmost Europeans of some mythical city\nof gold, deep in the South American\nrainforest - proof of how deeply this\nmyth has infiltrated our notions of this\nmagical land.\nThis mythical ritual was only one\nof many that occurred amongst\nthe pre-Hispanic tribes of ancient\nColombia. The Beyond El Dorado\nexhibition at the British museum sets\nout to decipher this El Dorado legend\nand, as the title suggests, go beyond\nthis to uncover the truth behind the\namazingly complex spiritual worlds\nof these tribes. Through extensive\nnew archaeological research, viewers\ngain a clearer picture of civilisations,\npreviously only known about through\nthe journals of colonisers, looking to\nmake it big in this land of wealth and\nopportunity.\nThe exhibition brings together pieces\nfrom all of the ancient Colombian\nkingdoms in a broad display of artistic\nmajesty and sophistication not evident\nanywhere else in the pre-colonial\nAmericas. Their ability to manipulate\ngold through advanced casting and\nhammering processes into divine\npiecesofartisunquestionable,evenjust\nby looking at the remaining artifacts\nnot melted down and taken back to\nSpain by gluttonous conquistadors.\nThe way that gold doesn\u2019t tarnish\nand is effectively ageless can make\nthe material seem oddly impersonal,\ninexpressive and monotonous.\nMoreover, it can feel over-extravagant\nand emotionally detached, especially\nwhen not in motion. Unless it is\nanimated, glistening, you do not\nget the same effect of power and\ntranscendence. However, the gold in\nthis exhibition is suitably dispersed\namongst a wide array of ceramic and\njewellery pieces, keeping it interesting\nand giving a more varied picture of the\ntechnical skill of these vibrant agrarian\nsocieties.\nIn 1499, when the Spanish arrived on\nthe shores of Colombia, they found a\npeople rich in resources beyond their\nwildest dreams. However, gold was\nnot seen as an economic commodity\namongst these peoples. It was a highly\nspiritual material, with all the power\nand energy of the sun, turning anyone\nwho wore it into a living deity. Its magic\nenabled spiritual transformations that\nconverted shaman into birds, jaguars\nor other powerful creatures. Music,\ndance and hallucinogens heightened\nthem into a trance-like state where they\ngained the abilities of these animals\n\u2013 knowledge, strength, speed \u2013 all of\nwhich could help their communities\nin war or if struck by disease. They\neven wore gold helmets in battles;\ncompletely inept at stopping an arrow\nbut, with all the power that channeled\nthrough them, the warriors who wore\nthem believed they were invincible\nwith the whole cosmos on their side.\nTransformation played a large part\nin the lives of these tribes. Their art\nconsistently shows humans in the\nprocess of metamorphosis, with\nwhiskers or snake scales, and they often\npracticedbodypaintingorscarification\nto create further modification. These\nceremonials aimed to blur the lines\nbetween spiritual and worldly power,\nmaking chiefs into demi-gods that\nthe people idolised and worshipped.\nTumbaga, an alloy of gold and silver,\nwas the material mainly used to create\ntheir ornamentation and also had\nspiritual meaning as well as practical\nbenefits. As well as being stronger\nthan pure gold, tumbaga represented a\nunion of gold, imbibed with the sun\u2019s\nenergy, and silver\u2019s luminescent quality\nrepresents the power and majesty of\nthe moon. By combining the two, the\nuniverse was united and art made from\nit had a heavenly aura like nothing else.\nBeyond El Dorado represents a\nrediscovery of the intricate societies,\nwhich, up until now, had been largely\nignored by European history. It was\nas if they were the new Spanish\nconquistadors returning from a far\nflung land, with new artifacts set to\ndazzle and delight. The exhibition\nfelt unique, exciting and extremely\ncomprehensive, just as one would\nexpect from the British Museum. I\ndo wish, however, there was more\nanthropological research done\ninto these tribes as opposed to\npurely archaeological, as it would\ncontextualize what I was seeing\nmuch more. To be able to see videos\nof modern tribes performing rituals\nwith full body art and decoration\nwould have just added the little extra\nsparkle that this golden exhibition was\nmissing.\n\u00a9 TRUSTEES OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM\nKamil McClelland\nWriter\nWhat: Beyond El Dorado: Power and\nGold In Ancient Columbia\nWhere: The British Museum, WC1\nWhen: Until 23rd March 2014\nPrice: \u00a37 students, \u00a39 adults\n\u00a9 MUSEO DEL ORO, BANCO DE LA REPUBLICA, COLOMBIA\n1,500 masterpieces looted by the\nNazis found in Munich\nArianna Sorba\nArts Editor\nA\nround one billion euros worth\nof art has been discovered in\nthe home of an 80 year old\nman in Munich. The collection,\nincluding pieces by Matisse,\nPicasso, Renoir and others, represents\none of the largest recoveries of looted\nart in recent history, and includes\nmany pieces previously unknown to art\nscholars.\nThe Nazis confiscated or destroyed\nartworks throughout the 1930s and\n1940s that they deemed \u2018degenerate\u2019\nor \u2018un-German\u2019\n, including many\nexpressionist, surrealist, cubist\nand Dada masterpieces. They also\nacquired entire collections of Jewish\nart collectors, either by forcing them\nto sell to the Nazis at extremely low\nprices, or simply taking them once the\ntrue owners had fled the country.\nThis particular haul was originally\ngathered by Hildebrand Gurlitt, a\nmuseum director who was meant to\nbe selling looted works abroad to make\nmoney for the Nazis. Instead, he kept\nthe works for himself, reported that the\nentire collection had been destroyed\nin the bombing of Dresden in 1945,\nand eventually handed them down to\nhis son, Cornelius. The collection was\nonly discovered when the reclusive\nCornelius, now 80 years old, was by\nchance investigated for tax evasion,\nand the 1,500 artworks were found\nstacked amongst empty juice cartons\nand tins of food in a darkened room in\nhis flat. It appears that Cornelius, who\nhasn\u2019t been seen since August this year,\nnever had a job or even opened a bank\naccount, and kept himself in pocket by\noccasionally selling off a masterpiece\nor two to art galleries and auction\nhouses.\nThe initial discovery was actually\nmade early last year, in February 2012,\nbut the German authorities have\nsince been sitting on the information\nin order to give art historians time to\nclarify the works\u2019 values and origins.\nThere\u2019s also the rather difficult task of\nfinding the rightful owners \u2013 or even\nthe descendants of the owners \u2013 of\nthe artworks. While most pieces do\nappear to have been acquired illegally\nduring the war years, the emergence\nof paintings by old masters such as\nCanaletto further complicate the\nsituation, and suggest that at least some\nof the collection has been legitimately\nbought by Gurlitt senior and thus really\ndo belong to Cornelius. It could take\nyears before the artworks are returned,\nrestored and finally displayed for the\npublic once again.\nGUIDING LIGHT TO THE STARS BY MARK GEE (AUSTRALIA)\n\n"

But the crucial thing is they needn\u2019t be, it\u2019s the music and not the ideas that\nkeep you hooked.

You just have to have the\nknowledgeandexperiencetodealwith\nthat problem, to understand when it\nbecomes a bit boring. We had a show\nin Sydney about four years ago where\nthis guy kept shouting the same shit all\nthe time and we kept humouring him\nand taking the piss out of him. A lot of\nthe people in the crowd enjoyed it, but\nif you\u2019re a long way back in the crowd,\nit\u2019s difficult to hear what the heckler\u2019s\nsaying, so you\u2019re only hearing one half\nof the conversation. That isn\u2019t always\napparent to the people on stage, so you\nneed to be aware that the experience\nfor everybody in the audience is not\nas hilarious as for those at the front,\nand when people have paid to come\nand see you, the emphasis is on\nentertaining them first and foremost.\nYou often drop a few mclusky tracks\ninto your Future of the Left sets. Is\nthat because you still enjoy playing\nthe songs or is just a treat for the\nfans?\nYeah, I mean they\u2019re really easy to\nplay and they\u2019re really good fun and I\nwrote them, so it would a shame not\nto hear those songs again. Particularly\nTo Hell with Good Intentions and\nLightsabre Cocksucking Blues, they\nreally are the easiest songs to play ever\nwritten and I love playing them. What\nis actually quite flattering is that people\na lot of people enjoy those songs. What\nis a bit sad is when the biggest reaction\nof the night is to those songs, and that\nhappens sometimes. But yeah, we like\nplaying them.\nFinally, ever since I first heard\nRobocop 4 \u2013 Fuck Off Robocop, I\u2019ve\nalways wanted to ask you, what\u2019s\nyour favourite film?\nI\u2019ve got a few, but probably, if it had to\nbe one, probably Dr Strangelove. I love\nBlazing Saddles, that\u2019s probably the\nbest out and out comedy. So yeah, Dr\nStrangelove, that\u2019s my favourite film.\nFuture of the Left\u2019s new album - How\nTo Stop Your Brain In An Accident,\nwas released on October 28th via\nPrescriptions\nEmbarrasments or Riches?\nRiaz Agahi examines a few new(ish) releases\nSergio Sorrentino &\nMachinefabriek\nVignettes\nAutodidactic Dutch graphic\nartist \u2013 turned sound artist Machinefabriek recently added to\nhis prolofic 2013 output with this\neffort, a collaboration with Sergio\nSorrentino, an Italian avante-garde\nguitarist considered to be one of the\nbest modern Italian guitarists. From\nan early age he showed a precocious\nbrilliance, performing in a tonne of\nplaces in his native country, and has\ngradually amassed a large amount of\nacclaim for his work, which, it should\nbe said is more Oren Ambarchi than\nSir Richard Bishop.\nThe album as a whole reminds me\nof the high point of Machinefabriek\u2019s\n2012 album Color Tones a 12 minute\ntrack called Mosaic, which culminates in a wonderfully relaxing and\nevocative guitar part. In a way, with\nSorrentino\u2019s able assistance, Machinefabriek has distilled the beauty of this\nmoment into an entire album, backed\nup by a suitable sense of dread, remi-niscient of Svarte Greiner\u2019s release of\nthis year, Black Tie.\nIf I were to describe Sorrentino\u2019s\nguitar work in 2 words I would say:\nnatural harmonics. I can totally understand why as well, as they possess\na subtlety that a notew often can\u2019t\nmuster and it\u2019s a tool I\u2019ve used endlessly in my own exploration of bass\nguitar.\nThe album is one of those albums\nthat flows as one piece, with an element at the end of each track ushering in the next. The electronic drone\nstyle sounds from Machinefabriek\u2019s\nsynth work extend notes beyond\ntheir expected length, giving a sort of\ndisorienting effect which maximises\nthe dynamics of the piece.\nThe only real problem I can\nthink of is that never really explodes,\nbut to change that would ruin its\nsubtlety.\nHuntsville\nPast Increasing, Future\nReceding\nHuntsville are one of the many\nNorwegian bands such as Puma, who\nfall into the \u2018jazz\u2019 category which for\nmy money is always a rather dismissive label to put on these normally very\neclectic artists, so for the purpose of\nthis review I am going to defy Occam\u2019s\nrazor and instead call them \u2018ambient\nfree-jazz-folk.\u2019\nThis is their second album since\nmoving from ubiquitous Norwegian\njazz label Rune Grammofon to Hubro\nand much like their other albums\nconsists of a small number of long\ntracks, in this case 3 tracks totalling\n40 minutes. I always feel like this is a\nbrave format for such a short album,\nbecause in a 40 minute punk album,\nfor example, you can afford to throw\na few crap songs in and no one will\nnotice.\nThe opener, Presence in Absence,\nstarts with some rather ominous, puls-ing, ethereal tones which are uncer-emonously eclipsed by a loud clatter\nfrom the drums, recalling in a way the\ndynamic brilliance of Emptyset. At 17\nminutes, it\u2019s rather a slow burner, and\ngradually adds layers over the course\nof the track as the timbre slowly\nthickens. Very melodic guitar work\ngives the track a meandering feel until\nit gradually decays, interesting, though\nis how each instrument has a moment\nwhere it leads the track.\n\u2018The Flow of Sand\u2019 is possibly my\nfavourite, as it evolves over a slightly\ndistorted repetitive bassline, like a\ndarker, less groovy Fire! Really what\nwe have is 3 interesting studies in\ndrone, which evolve slowly by varying\nthe elements involved and the more\nexpressive elements, like the guitar,\nseem to guide a change in mood.\nWhile the album\u2019s great, there\u2019s a\ncertain sense of no end product, but\nany Huntsville \u2013 or indeed free jazz\nfan, will know to enjoy the journey.\nJoachim Nordwall\nSoul Music\nThis album has the potential to be\none of my favourites of the year, and its\nquality is backed up by its recent place\nin Wire\u2019s latest office ambience, one of\nthe biggest accolades in my opinion.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s certainly the biggest misnomer of the year. Those in\nsearch of soul music should probably\nscurry back to their Motown collection\nas there\u2019s not much to enjoy here.\nWhat it does have, is Joachim\nNordwall of The Skull Defekts fame\nblasting out some music that I would\ndescribe as the lounge-music in purga-tory. It\u2019s not a huge departure from\nhis previous work, and indeed final\ntrack Psychic Propaganda is actually\na re-edit of last year\u2019s EP, showing a\nconnection between it and this work,\nwhich actually has a thicker timbre by\ncomparison.\nIf this is Dante\u2019s Inferno, then\nthe album\u2019s equivalent of Virgil is the\npercussion, provided by Jean-Louis\nHuhta, also from The Skull Defekts.\nThe percussion is really the central\ntheme of the album, one that hypno-tises and creates something of a trance\nlike state, but in a much more muted\nand eerie way than the electronic\ngenre.\nThe relation between this album\nand dance music definitely does hold\nwater though, particularly in tracks\nlike \u2018Soul Vibration\u2019 or the very appropriately titled \u2018Acid Ritual,\u2019 where\nNordwall\u2019s synth work recalls acid\nhouse. In fact, \u2018Acid Ritual\u2019 would be\na great alternative title for the album,\nparticularly given the dark ritualistic\nvibe that Nordwall produces through-out.\nIt reminds me a little of EVOL\u2019s\nProper Headshrinker, an album that\nit sounds nothing like but which, like\nSoul Music, presents the traditions of\nelectronic music in a very abstract and\nunfamiliar way.\n\n"

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 08 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOnly Tilda and Tom left alive\nOver the past few years we have sadly\nseen studios satisfy audiences\u2019 need\nfor film escapism with story-driven\nfantasy action (comic book films being the biggest example) while staying\naway from science fiction. Even sci-fi\nstaples like Star Trek -whose writers\nAlex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci are\ninvolved in this project- haven\u2019t been\nspared and have been turned into entertaining but nonetheless seat-rum-bling blockbusters.\nAfter decades in development\n(young Anakin Jake Lloyd was considered for the role of ten year old Ender),\nI had some hope that an adaptation\nof the popular novel Ender\u2019s Game\nwould inject some much needed scifi into blockbusters. But when I saw\nthat Gavin Hood, director of the terrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine, was\ndirecting that hope turned to fear that\na very good novel would be ruined. In\nThe endgame\nthe end, Ender\u2019s Game does neither.\nAfter an attack on Earth by an ant-like alien species called formics is very\nnarrowly defeated, humanity decides\nto prepare itself from a future attack\nby sending its best and brightest children to Battle School, a space station\nwhere they are groomed by Colonel\nGraff (Ford, with his usual geriatric\ngrumpiness) to become the army of\nthe future. The best and brightest of\nthem all is Ender Wiggin (Butter-field), but he is troubled by his violent\nimpulses.\nIn a way, Ender\u2019s Game is similar to\nthe first Harry Potter film -Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone-, up\nto dodgy lines and suspect acting by\nsome of the supporting child actors.\nThe film\u2019s appeal is exploring with\nthe main character the possibilities in\nthe new world he is in, much like the\nbest part of GTA is seeing if you can\nkill sharks with grenades. When we\nfirst enter space we see blobs of sick\nfloating around in zero gravity. In Battle School the students are trained by\nplaying a sort of zero gravity paintball\nin which limbs that get hit are rendered immobile, so we see the students try different strategies of dubious real world application.\nThe film leaves behind much of the\ndiscussion on war and the use of vio-lence, and all of the political backdrop\nfrom the book, to become a film about\nchildren bouncing around in space.\nBut if we judge it as that it is a very\nentertaining and well made film. It all\nescalates to a much bigger third act\nthat packs a lot of punch, and leaves\nwith a last scene that satisfies the\nviewers\u2019 need for closure but still sets\nup the possibility of a sequel.\nEnder\u2019s Game\nDirector: Gavin Hood\nWriters: Gavin Hood, Orson Scott\nCard (novel)\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Asa\nButterfield, Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail\nBreslin, Viola Davis, Ben Kingsley\nRuntime: 114 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nMichael S. Martin\nStar Writer\nOnly Lovers Left\nAlive\nDirector: Jim Jarmusch\nWriters: Jim Jarmusch\nStarring: Tom Hiddleston, Tilda\nSwinton, Mia Wasikowska, John\nHurt, Anton Yelchin, Jeffrey Wright\nRuntime: 123 minutes\nFred Fyles\nStar Writer\nThe veteran American actor Martin Mull once said \u2018a cult following is\na nice way of saying very few people\nlike you\u2019. Perhaps this is a worrying\nthought for legendary independent\ndirector Jim Jarmusch, whose latest\nfeature film Only Lovers Left Alive has\nbeen chosen to headline the \u2018Cult\u2019 section of the London Film Festival\u2019s pro-gramme. The components that make\nup the film - existential crises, nocturnal wanderings, and fetishisation\nof all things vintage - make it sound\na bit like some kind of obnoxious arts\nstudent\u2019s final project; they\u2019ve read a\nbit of Satre, seen A Bout de Souffle a\ncouple of times, and now can\u2019t wait to\nshow the world how achingly hip they\nare. However, despite some hipster-esque pretentions, Jarmusch\u2019s light\ntouch and shades of black humour\nmake this film incredibly entertaining.\nDescribed by Jarmusch as a \u2018cryptovampire love story\u2019, Only Lovers Left\nAlive focuses on the relationship between Adam and Eve, a pair of aging\nvampires played by Tom Hiddleston\nand Tilda Swinton. Drifting through\nthe streets of romantic Tangiers and\nheart-breakingly desolate Detroit like\nwandering stars, they come together\nfor night-time drives, ruminations\non the banality of modern life, and\ntrips to a local hospital to ensure their\nsupply of \u2018pure O negative\u2019 doesn\u2019t\nrun dry. Their peaceful cohabitation\nis momentarily interrupted when\nEve\u2019s sister Ava joins them, played to\nbratty perfection by rising star Mia\nWasikowska, but this forms a small\nblip on their introspective existence.\nIn fact, without this upset there would\nbe very little to drive the plot along;\ndespite great performances from John\nHurt as fellow vampire Christopher\nMarlowe and Anton Yelchin as Ian,\nAdam\u2019s only friend from the human\nworld, Only Lovers Left Alive is essentially a duologue between the central\ncharacters.\nThe fact that Adam makes his living\nas a secretive musician, creating songs\non antique recording equipment,\nfits in nicely with the film\u2019s brilliant\nsoundtrack, which won accolades\nat Cannes. Masterminded by Dutch\ncomposer Jozef van Wissem, and featuring the electronic/experimental/\navant-garde darling Zola Jesus, the antics of Adam and Eve are accompanied\nby an eclectic range of sounds that\nrange from the mid-century Motown\nthat made Detroit famous, to middle\neastern sounding string music, to epic\npost-rock soundscapes. Jarmusch\u2019s\nsoundtracks are always a delight, but\nwith this film he has outdone him-self, curating a breathtakingly brilliant\nplaylist.\nHowever, despite holding strong\nin most other regards, it is the script\nthat somewhat lets the film down.\nJarmusch, who wrote the screenplay,\nhas an obsession with name-dropping\nfamous poets, artists, and musicians\nthe two main characters have known\nover their long life; it seems that there\nwasn\u2019t a single person of note from the\nlast two centuries who didn\u2019t have the\npleasure of Adam and Eve\u2019s company\n- from Byron and Shelley, to Poe and\nthe aforementioned Marlowe. There\nis one particularly painful scene where\nAdam drives Eve past Jack White\u2019s former house in Detroit, and they both\nwax lyrically about how much they\nlove him.\nAlthough this habit does make the\nfilm seem a bit like an exercise in pre-tension, the wonderful humourous\nmoments scattered throughout the\nfilm - most notably a star turn for Jeffrey Wright as the phlebotomist \u2018Dr\nWatson\u2019, who supplies Adam his blood\nwith a side order of sardonic coolness\n- tip the balance in Jarmusch\u2019s favour,\npreventing things from getting too\nheavy.\nSwinton is, as ever, a magnificent\npresence on the screen. With her\npiercing gaze and startling appear-ance, she is an obvious choice to play\nEve - in every scene she is in she manages to quietly steal the show, stealthily drawing attention towards herself\nlike a black hole. With standout roles\nin a huge range of films - from Lynne\nRamsay\u2019s devastating We Need to Talk\nAbout Kevin to Tony Gilroy\u2019s thriller\nMichael Clayton - I feel like I can say,\nwithout risk of hyperbole, that Swinton is one of the most versatile and\ntalented actors of our time. On a side\nnote, it is incredibly refreshing to see\n- in an industry where actresses peak\nat the age of 30 - a film in which the\nromance is played out between an\nolder woman and a younger man.\nWithin Hollywood there is a tendency\nfor the leading man to engage in a relationship with a woman who is notably younger; I call this the \u2018Woody\nAllen Effect\u2019, after arguably the worst\noffender, whose films regularly feature him as the protagonist in a relationship with women up to 30 years\nhis junior. In Only Lovers Left Alive\nthe age difference between the protagonists isn\u2019t seen as a major factor\n(they are immortal after all), making\nit a seem like a breath of fresh air in a\nlargely patriarchal industry.\nThe cinematography in the film is\nsublime, with Detroit and Tangiers\ncaptured in long, languid shots; while\nit could easily be classed as \u2018ruin porn\u2019,\nthe burned out remains of Detroit\nform a beautiful backdrop for this\nunconventional love story. These im-ages, combined with the wonderful\nsoundtrack and the magnetic cast of\nSwinton and her bright young things,\nadd up to make a film that is almost\nachingly cool. Literally dripping in\nennui, Only Lovers Left Alive is a film\nthat will appeal to both hardcore\ncinephiles and casual viewers alike. A\ncult film? Certainly. An unlikable one?\nNot a chance.\nEntertainment Weekly\nwww.themovies.co.za\n\n"

Matchboxes would be\nthrown, pints would be downed and\ncrap costumes would be destroyed on\nsite.\nBefore all that promise though,\nthere was a football match to be\nplayed (believe it or not). It wasn\u2019t\njust any old football match either;\nthis was a grudge match with our\nless intellectual neighbours (all other\nLondon unis), it was an absolute must\nwin game that would see us go 2nd in\nour BUCS league that we had just been\npromoted to. Nothing was going to\nplan straight from the off, when one of\nour centre backs Omar \u2018I\u2019m the Fastest\nMan in IC Without Ever Leaving 2nd\nGear\u2019 Amjad pulled out injured with a\ncalf strain, probably from all that rapid\njogging. Rumours suggested it was due\nto an unorthodox warm up proposed\nby Captain Robinson, involving his\ngirlfriend, however Captain Robinson\nwas conveniently \u2018missing\u2019 during the\npre-match warm up and unable to\ncomment. The second blow was dealt\nwhen we received the news of having\nto get changed at Little Harlington,\nthe solitary confinement prison cell of\nchanging rooms.\nRegardless of the above we got out\nearly on to the 3G, the Megan Fox\nof university football grounds, and\nstarted our traditional pre-match\nroutine of high knees and high ankles.\nAfter what seemed to be an eternity,\nUCL decided to turn up, clearly having\nspent most of their morning debating\nwhether or not to actually make\nthe journey to Harlington by public\ntransport just so they could receive a\nwell measured on-pitch beating. They\nhad a really quick warm up, probably\nequivalent to how long they last in the\nbedroom, and were thrust (wahey)\non to the pitch where we had been\nwaiting for nearly an hour. We were\nabsolutely all over them in the first 20\nminutes and they had no idea what to\ndo with the ball,\nSomething just wasn\u2019t clicking for\nIC, Abou Ela-Bourquin was looking\nfor the long diagonal but it just wasn\u2019t\ncoming off. The deadlock was almost\nbroken when Captain Robinson was\nput through on goal; but their CB had\nother ideas and absolutely destroyed\nhim from behind. It was definitely\ninside the penalty area but the referee\nabsolutely bottled it and gave a free\nkick and no card. It was at this point\nwhere Hill decided the ref had gone\ninto the options menu on FIFA and\nturned off cards altogether, but 9 cases\nof assault later and Hill was finally\nbrandished a yellow card, something\nthat is almost as regular to him as\nbrushing his teeth twice daily. UCL\nfinally worked out which way they\nwere shooting and put some pressure\non our goal; it was at this point\nBofarull stopped packing his suitcase\nand brushing his brilliant Pantene\nPro-V mop of hair and came to life,\nmaking a superb close range save to\ntip the ball over the bar for a corner.\nWe cleared the corner to the right\nwing where Murphy pushed on with\nthe ball, Nielsen who was originally\non the front post overlapped with\nmore energy than a ferret on heat.\nSomewhere in that attack the ball was\nlost and it came to the UCL centre\nback who decided, as the last man, it\nwas an ideal time to pull off a Cruyff\nturn. Nielsen, who was still running\nfrom the front post, nicked in and\npinched the ball off him, putting him\none on one with their keeper.\nNielsen, utterly unaccustomed with\none on one contact, couldn\u2019t look him\nin the eyes and decided to look at the\nfar post instead and casually stroked\nthe ball into the near corner with the\noutside of his boot, leaving the keeper\nstranded, legs open, in the middle of\nPeter Nugent reports as Imperial College\u2019s 1st XI show UCL how it\u2019s done\nthe goal. Dominated. Cries of sheer\nsurprise erupted around Harlington\nseeing Nielsen so far up the pitch,\nafter his FIFA-esque goal celebrations\nhe had to receive treatment on the\nside-lines for a shock nosebleed, who\nwould have thought?\nIC went in at half time 1-0 up, in\ncase you mysteriously skipped down\nto the third paragraph. We knew we\nhad to keep up the intensity, and we\nhad to press as a team when they kept\nit at the back because they were about\nas comfortable at the back as James\n\u2018Frosstyyyyyy\u2019 Frost is with a drunken,\nsteaming iNuge screaming in his face\nfrom close quarters on a Wednesday\nnight after a few Blackthorns.\nThe second half kicked off and it\nwas all about IC, Maizonnier summed\nup the industrial side of the game\nworking hard to assist goal scorer\nNielsen at the back. Beasley and Hill\nworked tirelessly in the midfield\nwhile Kolawole Ayanwale effortlessly\nprovided the link between the midfield\nand Captain Robinson. The hard work\nall paid off when Murphy got down the\nleft wing with his back to goal, Nugent\noverlapped in a blur of blue and red,\nMurphy played a back heel to Nugent\nwho played it through to Ayanwale\nin the penalty box. Ayanwale had\nforced a save from a similar position\nin the first half; instead he laid it off\nto Captain Robinson who, with his\nback to goal, dropped a shoulder like\nit was hot, sent the defender to soccer\ncamp before turning the other way\nand burying the ball in to the back of\nthe net. 2-0 up but the match, you\u2019ll\nbe pleased to hear, was far from over.\nA solid defensive display from IC\nmeant that UCL were reduced to shots\nfrom far, one of those came off their\npost and they tried their best to score,\nfortunately for us the pressure was\nalmost too great but after successfully\nhitting the post a second time within\nthe space of a second the attack was\nquelled by Diaz. Captain Robinson\ncame off shortly after, some say it was\na pulled groin from the pre match\nwarm up, others say it was a twisted\nankle, but either way Shamsi made\nan appearance, initially with a snood\nthat he was told to either take it off or\ndown it.\nLuckily the ref never saw his\nbathrobe in the post match showers.\nCharrel also made an appearance, and\nwith a good touch and making some\ntough tackles he was impressive on\nhis 1s debut; however a second injury\nmeant that Crawford had to be called\nin to action. The responsible sober\ngiant was not too keen to play; some\nsay he had the flu, but rumour has it\nhe was keen to make a quick getaway\nto catch the school run.\nRegardless of his post match activity,\nhe played a solid role in seeing the\ngame out that was wrapped up with\nMurphy running half the pitch past\nnumerous defenders, with decoy runs\nmade by Shamsi and Nugent playing\na key role in diverting the attention\nof the defenders. Murphy played a\nsumptuous one-two off their keeper\u2019s\nhands and forced the ball in to the\nback of the net, not the only thing he\nforces in on a Wednesday.\nAt a 3-0 whitewash, the game was\nover and IC had come out on top. It\nwas a convincing victory in a must win\nBUCS match. The only variable of the\nday had gone our way, Nando\u2019s and\nACC to follow were sure bets to top\noff possibly the best day in history.

The\nsigning of Mezut Ozil has brought\nmuch-needed attacking nous to\nArsene Wenger\u2019s outfit, whereas\nMarouane Fellaini is fast becoming\na transfer flop. For Arsenal it is all\nabout maintaining their current form\n\u2013 their run of matches between now\nand Christmas is unenviable and they\nmustn\u2019t let their performances slip as\nthey have in recent years. Meanwhile,\nUnited\u2019s title challenge is only still\nalive because Man City and Chelsea\nhave been so inconsistent. But because of that I think they will want\nthe win more and there were certainly\na lot of positives to take from their\nstrong show against Fulham.\nPrediction: 2-1\nSunderland v Man City\n(Sunday 2:05pm, Sky Sports 1)\nThere were precious few signs of\nthe bounce we were all expecting\nfrom Sunderland at Hull last week\nafter their derby victory against Newcastle. By contrast, City claimed their\nbiggest ever Premier League win\nagainst Norwich last week and for\nthem it is all about producing those\nkinds of performances week in, week\nout. The Black Cats may have a good\nrecent home record against Man City,\nbut having two of their starting 11 out\nthrough suspension won\u2019t help their\ncause. All the signs point to a City win.\nPrediction: 0-3\nTottenham v Newcastle\n(Sunday 12pm, Sky Sports 1)\nNewcastle did really well to beat\nChelsea last weekend, containing the\nBlues for so long before hitting them\non the break. It seems as long as they\ndon\u2019t concede early, their confidence\ngrows and they are capable of a result\nagainst anybody. Spurs seem almost\nto have too many superstars who each\nexpect the other to come up with the\ngoods. They just lack that cutting edge\ndespite their big-name summer sign-ings. There could be boos ringing out\naround White Hart Lane again this\nSunday.\nPrediction: 1-1\nNorwich v West Ham\n(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nNorwich suffered a battering at Man\nCity last week but yet again their performance deserved better. They badly\nneed a win and they have an opportunity to get it here against the Hammers, who still have no fit strikers.\nPrediction: 1-0\nBest of the rest\n(Saturday 3pm unless stated)\nAston Villa v Cardiff\nAston Villa are simply not the same\nside at home. Cardiff looked good\nvalue for their win in the Welsh derby\nlast weekend and their defence will be\nhard for Villa to break down. They certainly have the guile to claim all three\npoints.\nPrediction: 0-1\nChelsea v West Brom\nThe Baggies continued their good\nrun against Palace last week but Chelsea will be reeling after their defeat at\nNewcastle. Jose Mourinho has only\nlost 3 of almost 200 home Premier\nLeague games and shouldn\u2019t have any\ndifficulties here.\nPrediction: 3-1\nCrystal Palace v Everton\nINSIDE\nFootball with tennis scoring? IC win In \u201ctie-breaker\u201d\nACTION IMAGES\nSEAN DEMPSEY / PA WIRE\nHonous even\nin Double\nHeader\nChris Carter gives his account.\nThe Imperial Falcons made a promising start to their season, splitting a\nfriendly double-header against UCL.\nAfter a 7-2 loss in Game 1, Imperial\nrallied to take Game 2 20-12, with an\nimpressive batting performance.\nThe first game started promisingly\nfor Imperial, as UCL failed to score\nin their first inning, following some\naccurate pitching by Zack Wang and\na spectacular leaping catch by rookie\nright-fielder Stephane Mangeon. After General Manager Matt Bidwell got\nhit by the first pitch of the Imperial in-nings, Zack hit a double to bring Matt\nhome, leaving Imperial 1-0 up after\nthe first innings. Despite Ashley Ng\nhitting a double and Zack surviving a\npick-off attempt at third with a spectacular dive, Imperial couldn\u2019t add to\ntheir tally.\nAfter some sloppy fielding by Imperial, however, UCL recovered to go 5-1\nafter their first three innings. Matt\nBidwell stepped up to the plate to lead\noff the inning and blasted a monstrous\nsolo home run to centre field (al-though the celebration left a lot to be\ndesired). The Falcons failed to capital-ise, however, as Ashley and Zack were\nleft on base again after good hits.\nUnfortunately, UCL added two more\nruns in the fourth inning and, despite\na valiant effort by the lower order\n(special mention to J.D. Smith\u2019s fearsome game face), Imperial couldn\u2019t\ncome back, with UCL running out 7-2\nwinners.\nThe second game started well for\nImperial, as UCL\u2019s new inexperienced\npitcher (it seemed the 50-Year-Old\nMan from last year had retired) gave\nup 9 runs in the top of the first, as almost the entire Falcons batting lineup got on base. In the UCL inning,\nImperial brought on Vincent \u201cDemon\nPitcher\u201d Li, who reduced UCL to only\nthree runs. In the freezing cold and\ndriving rain, Imperial piled on the\npressure in the top of the second in-nings, adding another 8 runs after a\nnumber of walks and some good base\nrunning.\nThe Falcons gave up runs in the bottom of the second after a few wild\npitches and some slightly over-am-bitious fielding (it turns out this isn\u2019t\nMLB and double plays are still a bit\nbeyond us), although by then it was\ntoo late for UCL. Imperial added even\nmore runs in the top of the third (de-spite a pitching change by UCL), after\nhits by Zack Wang and Marcel \u201cAsian\nKevin Youkilis\u201d Ngan.\nImperial went into the final innings\n13 runs ahead and looking certain of\nvictory. Some excellent catching by\nVincent kept the runs to a minimum,\nand the first two batters were quickly\ndispatched, leaving Imperial needing\nonly one out to win. After a couple of\nwild pitches (and the threat of being\nreplaced by Marcel), Zack took con-trol, and got the batter to ground-out\nto finish the game, with Imperial running out 20-12 winners.\nIC BASEBALL\nIt\u2019s hard to see where Crystal Palace\u2019s next point is going to come from,\nlet alone their next win. It should be\ncomfortable for the Toffees who are\nquietly impressing this season.\nPrediction: 0-2\nLiverpool v Fulham\nThis is a home banker if there ever\nwas one. Liverpool have the best strike\npartnership in the division, whereas\nFulham are consistently terrible away.\nYou just hope for Martin Jol\u2019s sake this\ndoesn\u2019t become a cricket score.\nPrediction: 4-0\nSouthampton v Hull City\nThese sides are two of the best organised in the league. But the Tigers\nare not as menacing away from the\nKC Stadium and will struggle to break\ndown what is statistically one of the\nbest defences in Europe\nPrediction: 1-0\nSwansea v Stoke\nBoth of these sides will have started\nthe season with their sights set on the\ntop half but have flattered to deceive\nthus far. Unfortunately for the neutral,\nthey struggle for goals so don\u2019t expect\nmuch entertainment.\nPrediction: 1-0\n\n"

With\nNancy Edge as the club\u2019s\nTour Secretary, and a trip to Brighton\nin the midst, it was bound to be a great\nweekend for all! However, no freshers\nsigned up so it was going to be a\ncommittee bonding session if nothing\nelse!\nAfter bad news about Club Captain\nToni Semmence\u2019s ankle the same\nweek, treasurer Harriet Rumgay was\nall too ready to cancel the trip as on\ntour-eve it was looking like we would\nonly have 6 players to take to Sussex\nUni. After much peer pressure by club\nmember Emily Rolfe, our treasurer\nwas persuaded to go ahead with the\ntrip, especially after having called up\nthe hostel in Brighton to see about\ngetting a refund on the rooms and\nbeing told \u201cno refunds\u2026 but you\ncan still cancel if you want?\u201d swiftly\nreplying with \u201cwe\u2019ll keep all the rooms\nthen!\u201d\nOn the morning of the tour our\ntreasurer had calmed down enough to\ntake the driver\u2019s seat, only to find the\nengine warning light staring straight\nat her. Throwing caution to the wind\nwe climbed aboard and set off for\nBrighton in style, all thanks to Surf\nSoc who left their Cornwall sing-a-long CDs in the glove compartment\nwith a few pre-tour mix-tapes. Thanks\nguys!\nThe traffic was horrendous. So\nwere the drivers. With many cut-ins\nand close encounters, we took to the\nbus lane a lot more than we would\nhave liked.

Whoever\nthought the waltzes and dodgems\nwere a good idea after a full meal must\nhave been mad; however the girls kept\nit all down and decided to go for a\npaddle in the sea\u2026\nSo most of the girls just went to dip\ntheir toes in the water\u2026 not our social\nSecretaries! Georgie and Zoe Hudson\nleapt straight in, after confirming\nthat Georgie is actually a qualified\nlife guard, and cooled off in the huge\nwaves. Then it was time to find the\nhostel and get ready for our night on\nthe town!\nAfter finding out a little bit more\nabout each other we set off to meet\nthe girls from Sussex Uni for a bit of\na hoe down with some bunnies. Soon\nenough, someone at the Halloween\nparty downstairs threw a stink bomb\nso we took it as our cue to leave. \u201cWe\ndidn\u2019t want to stay at your Yates\u2019s\nanyway!\u201d\nWe moved on to Funfair where\nGeorgie was mistaken for a model\nand had her picture taken with some\nrandoms, and soon enough we were\nall knackered. Our Club Captain got\ntold to put her shoes back on or leave\n(classy lady). Treasurer was being a\nresponsible driver so we decided it\nwas time to go. About 20 minutes later\nthe Sussex Uni girls finally finished\ntheir goodbyes and we braced the\ngale force winds and rain for the short\nsprint back to the hostel.\nWith the clocks having gone back\nan hour it was way too early to call it\na night so we popped to the nearest\nkebab shop for some grub. Sponsor\nsecretary Ella M\u00e5rtenson used\nher persuasive skills in securing a\npretty big deal with her garlic mayo;\nmeanwhile our fixtures secretary\nLaura Kor absolutely demolished her\nburger, whereas Georgie smeared hers\nall over her face, hands and the table\u2026\nIt was definitely time for bed.\nAfter a few hours\u2019 shutweye we were\nup early to pick at the \u201ccontinental\u201d\nbreakfast and get back in the minibus.\nWe made it to London in good time\nafter some excellent eco-driving from\nthe Treasurer- always thinking of\nthe club\u2019s money, obviously- and just\nbefore the storm hit!\nAll in all we had a great time in\nBrighton and would like to thank the\nSussex Uni girls for their hospitality,\nand everyone who came on tour for\nmaking it a success!\nWe have also gained a new\ncommittee member as what would\nbe honorary secretary, but we already\nhave one of those, so she can be our\nlegendary secretary- Emily Rolfe!\nImmortals\nslay the\nDragons\n26-0\nA\nfter a preseason win\nagainst Sussex Saxons,\nthe Immortals were ready\nto take on Westminster Dragons\nat Harlington in their first regular\nseason game.\nThe first half opened with\nbig drives up the field from the\nImmortals, and the Dragons\nbeing reduced to punting away\npossession. The scoring was\nopened by Emanuel Olagbaju who\nbroke several tackles to rush in\nfrom 25-yards.\nHutchinson continued to stop\nthe Dragons\u2019 pass game whilst\nGuillaume Fontan stopped the\nrun. The rookie quarterback, Toby\nSinclair, then snuck into the end\nzone from 1-yard, and with the\n2-point conversion completed by\nDuncan MacKinnon the lead was\n14-0 going into half time.\nThe strong opening continued\ninto the second half. The Dragons\ntried to catch out the Immortals\nwith an onside kick, but luckily\nCharlie Edwardson was in position\nto recover the ball. Sinclair rushed\nin for another score, which was\nfollowed by a goal line stop by the\nImmortal\u2019s defense.\nThe win was sealed when veteran\nTino Millar caught a 30-yard pass\nfrom Joe. The Immortals\u2019 defence\nmade another stop and the hard-fought game was over. Next week\nthe Immortals travel to Greenwich\nMariners for what promises to be\nanother exciting game.\nHenry Badham\nImmortals Press Secretary\nIC AMERICAN FOOTBALL\n\n"

Provost\nof Imperial College James Stirling said\nthat the college were \u201chonoured that\nPresident Park has chosen Imperial\nfor such a significant part of her State\nVisit\u201d. During her visit, President Park\nwas given demonstrations of various\npieces of ground breaking research,\nincluding an \u201cinvisibility cloak\u201d using\nmetamaterial technology. She also saw\nprojects such as the latest robotic body\nsensing technology, plastic electronics\nand quantum technologies. These are\nfields where UK research is considered\nto be world leading.\nScience and Universities Minister\nDavid Willetts MP, who accompanied\nPresident Park on her visit to Imperial,\nsaid, \u201cInternational collaboration\nacross Higher Education is essential if\nthe UK is to remain ahead in the global\nrace for science and innovation.\u201d He\nalso added \u201cImperial College London\nis crucial to many of the eight great\ntechnologies including big data,\nrobotics, space and synthetic biology.\nWorking alongside the Republic of\nKorea will strengthen our relationship\nand allow greater collaboration in\nyears to come.\u201d\nThe visit itself began with speeches\nfrom President Park, David Willetts\nand Professor Stirling, following\nwhich President Park was shown\nthe research being presented. In\naddition to this, the event featured\nworkshops for academics, investors\nand entrepreneurs from both nations\nto explore additional UK-Korean\ncollaboration and development\nin fields such as future innovative\ntechnologies, digital cultural content,\nand cooperation among small and\nmedium enterprises (including\nadditional support for startups).\nIn the lead up to the event, Imperial\nsigned an agreement to enhance UKKorean cooperation in developing\nhydrogen and fuel cell technologies.\nA Memorandum of Understanding\nwas signed by Professor Stirling and\nProfessor Taihyun Chang, Provost\nof Pohang University of Science and\nTechnology (POSTECH) in Korea.\nImperial\u2019s Energy Futures Lab is the\ncentral hub for research into fuel cell\ntechnologies in the United Kingdom.\nImperial is also due to sign a strategic\npartnership agreement with the\nKorean Institute of Science and\nTechnology (KAIST).\nImperial College already has a strong\nconnection with Korean universities,\nhaving already attained extensive\nlinks with KAIST, POSTECH and\nSeoul National University. In addition\nto this Imperial also has strong links\nwith Korean industry, having formed\npartnerships with Samsung and LG.\nSponsored Editorial\nT\nhe new-look postgraduate\nbar is set to open this Friday,\nwith pictures released by\nthe Union and College\npreviewing what it will\nlook like and explaining the services\nprovided by the new space.\nWith its combination of wood tables\nand green leather upholstery, the new\nlook bar was described by Kirsty Roy,\na PhD student from the department\nof Materials as \u201cLooking exactly like a\nMcDonalds\u201d. Its previous incarnation,\nthe Holland Club which closed in\n2012, had a \u2018traditional British pub\u2019\nd\u00e9cor (i.e. \u2018dark and dingy\u2019) but it\nwas this atmosphere that many of its\nregulars enjoyed.\nThe name, \u0127,prompted half of the\npeople I interviewed to laugh and the\nother half to face-palm.It was chosen\nout of a shortlist of student and staff\nsubmitted names, with the final choice\nbeing made by a committee including\none of the Sabbatical Officers.\nThe most drastic change in operation\nof the bar is the fact that during the\nevening the space will be available\nto all staff and students (including\nundergraduates) for dinner. At this\ntime (between 5-7pm), the evening\ndinner service currently provided\nby the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms will\nbe served in canteen area of \u0127, and\nthe postgrad and staff pub area at\nthe back will be closed off behind a\nmovable soundproof partition. Whilst\nallowing the staff and postgraduates\nsome privacy, they will still have\nto potentially walk through a busy\ncanteen full of undergraduates to\nget to the bar, a fact that several staff\nand PhDs we spoke to were unhappy\nabout. Fortunately for postgrads and\nstaff a-like, this arrangement will\nnot be the case on Friday evenings.\nAs anyone who used to use the old\nHolland Club knows, Friday nights\nwere by far the busiest evenings,\nfrequently reaching full capacity by\n6pm. Instead on Fridays the \u0127 will be\nserving [alcohol] from 4pm and the\nwhole space, canteen and bar, with a\ncombined capacity for 250 people, will\nbe serving staff and postgrads only.\nThe previous entrance to the old\nHolland Club is now closed off and\nserves as a fire escape, while the new\nentrance is only accessible via the\nSherfield building. Several staff we\nspoke to predicted calls for this to be\nre-opened so that access would be\navailable for staff to go enjoy a pint\nwithout having to come face to face\nwith their tutees eating. However,\naccording to Union sources the door\ncannot be used as an entrance due\nto the conditions of their license.\nThey also mentioned that the new\nentrance provides wheelchair access\n(via the new lift) and the bar is also at\na wheelchair-friendly height.\nDespite complaints about the\nappearance of the bar, and the\ngeneral bemusement at how the one-space, two-uses policy will actually\nwork when the whole thing opens\nnext week; most people we spoke\nto seemed resigned that they would\nprobably get used to the new look,\nwith one PhD student summarising it\nas \u201csort of like when Facebook updates\nand I hate it for a bit,\u201d whilst agreeing\n\u201cthat it makes sense that they need the\nspace, but it sucks because I loved the\nold place.\u201d\nMatthew Allinson\nReporter\nSome postgraduates critical of h-bar\nPresident of Republic\nof Korea visits Imperial\nLayton Thompson / IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\n\u201c\n\u201d\nPark Geun-hye\nPresident of the Republic of\nKorea\nIt gives me great\npleasure that we\nhave gathered\nat the world\nrenowned Imperial\nCollege London\n\u2013 famous for\nits cutting edge\nresearch in science\nand technology\nKunal Wagle\nSection Editor\nJOSEPH LETTS\nThings that make you go hmmmmm?\n\n"

Thankfully, the Nexus 5 has\nditched the rear buttons on the G2\n(which LG touts as innovation), for\nmorepracticalbuttonplacements.The\nphone comes with 2 GB of RAM, and\na Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 system-on-chip (SoC), which is pretty much\nthe best SoC from Qualcomm you\ncan get on a smartphone at the time\nof release. It boasts a 4.95-inch 1080p\nscreen with a staggering 444 pixels per\ninch.Alloftheseareavailableforavery\naffordable unlocked and contract-free\nprice of \u00a3299. The Nexus 5 has clearly\ntaken the best of the Nexus 4, and\ncorrected some of its glaring faults.\nThe Nexus 4 was a great device\none year ago for its price. As Felix\nhad wrote about it a year ago, the\nNexus 4 boasted some of the best\nhardware you could get at that\ntime. However, it also fell short in\nthree areas, all of which Google has\naddressed in the Nexus 5. Most (in)\nfamously, Google left out Long Term\nEvolution (LTE), or 4G support in\nthe Nexus 4. This has been rectified\nin the Nexus 5- it will allow you to\nuse it on any LTE network around\nthe world, save for North America.\nThe Nexus 4 also came with\nlimited storage options, namely only\n8 GB and 16 GB. The Nexus 5 has\nalso rectified this by providing 16\nand 32 GB options. Finally, while\nthe Nexus 4 suffered from horrible\navailability issues, and the order\nwebsite promptly crashed under the\nweight of its own popularity, the same\ndoes not seem to be the case for the\nNexus 5. Initial orders made via the\nPlay Store have already been shipped,\nand should arrive within the week.\nCustomers can also buy them from\nretailers like Carphone Warehouse.\nAlongside the debut of the Nexus 5\nis a new Android version dubbed Kit\nKat. Kit Kat is another minor update\nto the operating system (OS), with\nsome minor visual changes allowing\napplications to turn the status bar\nand the navigation bar transparent.\nKit Kat also continues the Googlefying of the OS by turning some of the\ncore parts of the OS into Google apps\nthat can be updated via the Play Store,\nas mentioned in a previous article\n(How Google Updated Android\nwithout Updating Android). The home\nscreen of Kit Kat is now essentially a\nGoogle variant of the Facebook Home\nconcept, making Google Search\npower many aspects of the interface.\nThe old Android texting app has also\nbeen removed, in favour of integration\nwith Google Hangouts which now also\nhandles text. There are also various\nunder the hood changes to the OS that\nare of more interest to developers,\nsuch as the changing of the SELinux\nmode from permissive to enforcing.\nGoogle\u2019s Nexus programme\nbegan with the Nexus One as a\nmeans of setting benchmarks for\nother phone manufacturers to\nwork towards. Although the first\nphone wasn\u2019t exactly a commercial\nsuccess, subsequent releases have\ngarnered a dedicated fan-base.\nThis is quite evident when the US\nPlay Store started reporting multiple-weeks of waiting for people who\nwant to order the phone late for all\nthe models. In the UK, at the time of\nwriting, the black coloured models\nare all quoted as being shipped in\n2-3 weeks time, while the white\ncoloured models are still available.\nIf you are looking for a new\nsmartphone, and are unwilling to be\ntied down to a contract, the Nexus\n5 is the phone for you. For the price,\nyou can get excellent hardware that no\nother phone in the market can offer.\nGoogle.CoM\n\n"

Witness\nthe success of \u201cCaptain\nPhillips\u201d, a film in which\na vessel captained by\nthe actor Tom Hanks is hijacked by\nSomalis. Somali pirate operations\nhave been a major threat to ships in\nthe Gulf of Aden and those bypassing\nthe Indian Ocean. Yet the pirate\nmodus operandi is far from clear\nto intelligence agencies. In order\nto contain their activities many\norganizations have come together to\nunderstand their funding operations.\nReports have it that between $339m\nand $413m was paid in ransoms off\nthe Somali coast between 2005 and\n2012. Ordinary pirates usually get\n$30,000-75,000 each, with a bonus\nof up to $10,000 for the first man to\nboard a ship and for those bringing\ntheir own weapon or ladder.\nQat, a narcotic plant that is chewed\nby many, is often provided to pirates\non credit during an operation.\nTraditionally used in the same way\nas coffee - to assist social gatherings,\nmeetings and ceremonies such as\nweddings - the stimulant qat, like\ncoffee, is widely believed to have\noriginated from Ethiopia. And, just as\ncoffee was criticized and even banned\nin parts of Africa during the 16th\ncentury, so the mildly narcotic khat\nhas recently found itself at the center\nof a moral debate. Islamic rulers in\nMogadishu, the capital of Somalia,\nrecently banned use of the drug. This\nled Kenya, Somalia\u2019s biggest supplier,\nto stop all flights to its neighbor,\nsparking street protests in Mogadishu,\nand triggering concern among qat\ngrowers and traders in Kenya, who saw\nexports drop by 40 per cent. In Kenya,\nqat has semi-legal status, but this has\nnot stopped farmers from cultivating\nthe crop. In fact, qat cultivation is\ncurrently expanding into new areas,\nsuch as Embu and Nyeri, outside the\ntraditional growing area of Meru, near\nMount Kenya.\nDepending on personal\nconsumption of qat, pirates receive\nthe pending sum upon successful\ncompletion of their mission. Some\npirates find it difficult to retire\nbecause they end up in debt at the\nend of a hijack. Part of the ransom\nmoney flows to local communities\nthat provide services to pirates. Al\nShabaab, a terrorist group that wields\nenormous power in the area also\nThe situation in Iraq after the war with US\nE\nver since the US troops were\nwithdrawn from Iraq in\n2011, there has been little\ninternational coverage about\nthe situation in Iraq. Iraq is\nin a state of dysfunctional governance\nand civil strife. This has caused the\npresent Prime Minister, Nuri AlMaliki, to ask for military assistance\nfrom the US.\nON March 7, 2010, the people\ncame out in large numbers to vote\nin the national legislative election.\nThe credibility of the elections\nbecame questionable by the\ndisqualification of 500 candidates by\nthe Supreme National Commission\nof Accountability and Justice due to\ntheir alleged links to the Ba\u2019ath Party,\nthe party to which Saddam Hussein\nbelonged. In November 2010, a\ncoalition formed between all the major\npolitical factions, which resulted in a\npolitical vacuum. This allowed armed\ngroups to assert themselves in various\nareas.\nThere is currently a security failure\nin Iraq. Since there is no interior\nor defense minister in Iraq, both of\nthese tasks are managed by Al-Maliki.\nIn cities across Iraq where there is a\npredominant presence of the Sunni\nminority, Maliki\u2019s troops lead by the\nShiite majority has had to withdraw.\nWhilst in other places the troops have\nhad to face desertion, which may be\ncaused by the forces\u2019 local alliance.\nFurthermore, the security forces have\nhad to withdraw from key towns in\nAnbar and from a mainly Sunni area\nin the neighborhood province of\nSalheddin.\nAbout 500 Iraqis have been killed\nsince April of this year by Sunni\ninsurgents who have been bombing\nand attacking the Shiite majority. A\nlarge number of these insurgents have\nbeen infiltrating from neighboring\nSyria, which is itself facing a severe\ncivil war of its own. A number of\nthese forces are also home grown with\ntheir allegiance with Al Qaeda. ISIS\n(Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is one\nof the most active insurgent group\nin the country. Apart from opposing\nthe Shiite led security groups, these\ninsurgent groups also attack Sunni\nmilitias which were previously\nopposed to Al-Qaeda and were\nknown as the Sahwa, or awakening,\nsupported by the US troops during\ntheir operation in 2007.\nThe government forces tend to take\nrefuge in barracks as they are unwilling\nto conduct patrols on the streets. This\nunwillingnesshasresultedintheforces\nconducting raids and mass arrests of\nKartikeya Rana\nPolitics Editor\ndemands a chunk of the proceeds of\na hijack from ordinary pirates. The\ndaily supplies and mobile network\nare sold off to them at inflated rates.\nFinancing comes from former police\nand military officers or civil servants,\nqat dealers, fishermen and former\npirates. They take anywhere between\n30% and 75% of the ransom. A typical\noperation has three to five investors.\nSome financiers, especially those in\nthe Somali diaspora who have little\ncash inside Somalia but large deposits\nabroad, employ what the report\ndescribes as \u201ctrade-based moneylaundering\u201d to send funds to Somalia.\nIn order to contain pirate activity\nin the area, a number of measures\nneed to the taken. It turns out\nthat government policies are not\nparticularly favorable for setting up\nprivate enterprise that would lead to\njob creations. The involvement of ex-government officials further worsens\nthe situation.\nAs long as government support to\npirate financers is not severed, ship\nhijacks would continue to flourish.\nMoney laundering has enabled the\nswift execution of a number of these\nghastly acts. Somalis residing in UAE,\nKenya and Djibouti are believed to\nbe the main beneficiaries of the loot.\nIf current sources are identified and\nheld punishable, it could serve as a\ndeterrent to nouveau financers.\nKenya has long been the chief\nprovider of qat to east African nations.\nMany more are now turning to qat,\nwhich is not only easier to grow, but\ncan be harvested twice a year and\nbrings in an inwcome that is five times\nhigher than coffee. The trade has\ngreatly contributed to development in\nthe district of Meru, and local farmers\nare calling for the status of qat to be\nformalized. Qat-chewing is big (and\ngenerally legal) business in much of\nthe region, and the role of Somalis in\ndistributing it is growing. The lack of\ntransparency or monitoring of the qat\ntrade in Kenya, the main supplier to\nSomalia, makes it susceptible to crime.\nIn such an atmosphere, conventional\nmeasures are rendered inefficacious.\nTrue that one man\u2019s trash is another\nman\u2019s treasure.\ncivilians, which has further angered\nthe Sunni minority. Not only is there\nanger against the heavy handedness\nof the government forces but also\ndue to the failure of the government\nto do something for its citizens. The\ngovernment is dysfunctional and\nunable to pass important legislation.\nThere is also rampant corruption and\na lack of electricity, which further\nadds to the people\u2019s grievances.\nNuri Al-Maliki has now asked the\nUS for military assistance to fight\nthe insurgents. The demands include\na request for an apache helicopter\nand drones amongst other military\nequipment. Tehran tends to emphasis\nthat Al Qaeda is a common threat to\neveryone. In return for US support,\nAl- Maliki offers to negotiate with\nIran over cutting down on their\nnuclear program. Although Tehran\nand Baghdad have got increasingly\nclose, holding talks with the Iranian\ngovernment is unlikely to reap any\nfruitful rewards.\nObama is also unlikely to be able to\nmeet all of Al Maliki\u2019s demands for a\nvariety of reasons. Firstly, helicopters\nand F16 fighter jets are of little use\nagainst insurgents. Furthermore, AlMaliki\u2019s government has not been\nable to be inclusive of all the minority\ngroups. Many US Senators feel that\nAl-Maliki should not be supported\nuntil he shares power with the\nKurdish and Sunni minority groups.\nIf the government does not include\nminority groups, it will continue\nto lack support and resultantly the\ninsurgent forces will remain strong.\nAl-Maliki\u2019s support of Basher AlAssad is also unlikely to gain him any\nsupport from US senators.\nAfter years of rule by Saddam\nHussein, Iraq is finding increasingly\nhard to transition to democracy.\nAfter the Iraq war, the country lacked\nresources to rebuild itself as a nation\nand as a result the divisions between\nthe various groups have grown\nstronger.\nNuri Al-Maliki needs to hold more\ntalks with the various minority groups\nand show that he is more inclusive\nbefore he asks for aid from foreign\nnations. It will be interesting to see\nhow the situation plays out.\njafrianews.com\nthe guardian\nLet\u2019s have more than\ntwo people sharing\ntheir views on\nPolitics.\nSend your articles\nto:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nA frustrated Nuri-Al Maliki\n\n"

Janney is full of\nhilarious one-liners in every single\none of her scenes, Faris does her usual\nbrilliant work, and together they help\nthe dark comedy script come to life.\nVarious issues regarding addiction,\ntheir regrets and past mistakes surface whenever a mother and daughter\npairing takes place, and the snarky\ncomedy surrounding such issues\nmostly works.\nNo this has nothing to do with the\ncomedy hit of 2013, We\u2019re the Millers.\nWith The Millers, a tv series which debuted this season, we see Margo Martindale, who has been shown a lot of\nlove lately thanks to her remarkable\nsupporting turns in deadly serious\nshows like Justified and The Americans, going for a lead role in a comedy\nshow and mightily succeeding.\nThe titular Millers refer to a family unit made up of the parents Tom\n(Beau Bridges) and Carol (Martin-dale), their children Nathan (Will Arnett) and Debbie (Jayma Mays), Debbie\u2018s significant other Adam (Nelson\nFranklin), as well as their kid Mikayla\n(Eve Moon), with Nathan\u2019s colleague\nRay (J.

However, we\nstill find ourselves merely engaging\nin dialogue about how TEK should be\nappliedtopolicy-makingandresearch.\nThe world of conservation is only now\nrecognising that incorporating other\ndisciplines is necessary if any changes\nwe try to make as scientists are going\nto stick.\nI first learned about TEK when\nI attended an annual meeting held\nby the Society for Conservation\nBiology in 2010. The topic was how\nto build a bridge of communication\nbetween indigenous peoples and\nscientists. I was surprised to see the\nanger and bitterness from indigenous\ncommunities, that such a dialogue was\nonly being put to the table at that time.\nWhy hadn\u2019t it happened sooner?\n\u201cThere is something Western\nscientists don\u2019t understand,\u201d they said,\n\u201ca spiritual connection that makes\nour relationship to the land unique\u201d.\nI would argue that there are plenty\nof scientists with a spiritual side, but\nwere these communities right? Do\nthey know the land in an intimate way\nthat scientists can never accomplish?\nI\u2019m convinced that the indigenous\npeoples living in reservations in\nArizona aren\u2019t the only ones who feel\nthis way. Modern day society finds\ncountless ways to further fragment\nitself.\nWe are faced with a history that\nis dark, one that many people are\nunwilling to forget and perhaps not\nevenforgive.Itisclearthatwhilstwesit\nin our self-righteous chairs exclaiming\nthat barriers must come down, they\nhaven\u2019t completely. Targeting climate\nchange mitigation could be a way of\nbuilding a bridge.\nMany solutions that have been\nposed in the recent past involve\nalternative energy sources and\nbeing \u2018green\u2019, but the people most\naffected by climate change tend to\nbe indigenous communities in poor\ndeveloping countries. Adaptation by\nsome scientists is being presented as\na solution, given that extreme weather\nconditions such as droughts and\nfloods have already made an impact.\nIndigenous people have applied\nTEK successfully in this regard.\nIn the African Sahel, for instance,\nfarmers use a zero-tilling method that\nallows their crops to prosper under\nharsh climate. The Inuit hunters\nin Alaska have been able to keep\nhunting bowhead whales despite their\nchanging migrations. It took years for\nscientists to realize that their estimate\nof the bowhead whale population was\nwrong and that the Inuit had a much\nmore accurate number. The Inuit also\nbrought up the importance of wind\nstrength and direction as a factor in\nanalysing migration patterns.\nAnother success story is with The\nHotspots Fire Project in Australia,\nwhich is getting communities together\nto talk about fire and how to manage\nit because of increasing risk of fire\noutbreaks due to climate change.\nAlong with landowners and scientists,\nthe Aboriginal community is taking\npart, spreading their knowledge on\nfire management.\nThe extent to which their knowledge\nis being applied is unclear, but\nrecognising that these people have\nadaptation methods that have worked\nfor many years is a move in the right\ndirection.\nClimate change is a global problem,\nbut there is no global solution. As with\nother aspects of conservation, the\npossible solutions need to be applied\non a local level. Using TEK helps\nlocalise the problems and mitigation\nefforts.\nThere is a risk that TEK might be\n\u2018wrong\u2019 and evidence behind certain\nstrategies are usually anecdotal and/\nor biased, but the rate at which the\nclimate is changing means we don\u2019t\nhave the luxury of time. TEK could\nspeed up the scientific process by\nproviding scientists with information\nthat gets them to ask the appropriate\nquestions and gather data more\nquickly.\nSo let\u2019s cut the dialogue about what\nwe should be doing as scientists\nand conservationists. A systemic\nstrategy should be put in place to\ngo beyond initial communication\nbetween indigenous communities and\neveryone else.\nTEK isn\u2019t science, but without it, we\nrisk greater biodiversity loss, cultural\nloss, and a slowed implementation of\nclimate change solutions. Using TEK\nshould be the norm.\nAfter all, with climate change\nalready negatively impacting people\nacross the world, what more do we\nhave to lose?\nScience image of the week: a digital hologram of malaria\nT\nhis rather unassuming\ncollection of blobs is\nactually a male Plasmodium\nsp. parasite (on the left, with\nthe \u2018tail\u2019 known as a flagella)\nswimming among red blood cells,\nlooking to penetrate into them to\nreplicate within their fragile structure.\nThis parasite causes malaria, and is\nspread via the mosquito Anopheles\ngambiae when they take up blood\nduring feeding, unknowingly\nspreading the parasite from person to\nperson.\nUpon the parasite replicating to\nbreaking point, the cells will burst\nopen to relinquish a whole new\npopulation of the parasite that will\nthen go on to continue the lifecycle\nof this potent protozoan, or simply\ninvade more red blood cells.\nIt is not what this image is capturing\nhowever, but in what way this image\nhas been produced that is notable.\nScientists have developed a 3D\nfilming technique that creates digital\nholograms of the sperm-like cells,\nknown as microgametes, to show\njust how they infect the cells in the\nbloodstream. Understanding how\nthese microgametes then mate\ntogether in their sexual lifecycle could\nleadtoimprovingpreventivemethods\nof the disease from spreading.\nThe researchers saw that the\nmicrogametes move in an irregular,\nlopsided corkscrew motion, allowing\nthem to move in a multitude of\ndirections to find female mates whilst\nswimming among blood cells.\nThis was developed by the\nUniversity of Edinburgh and the\nRowland Institute at Harvard\nUniversity.\nDr Sarah Reece, Royal Society\nFellow at the University of Edinburgh\nand one of the authors of the study,\nsaid: \u201cFindings gained using our\nunique system provide us with a\nbetter understanding of how malaria\nparasites mate and spread this\ndeadly disease, and have revealed\nthat malaria sperm, and similar\norganisms, have greater freedom\nof movement than was previously\nthought.\u201d\nLocal knowledge of those that live in close confines with nature could help solve issues facing ecology today\nHTTP://WWW.ETHNOBIOMED.COM/\n\n"
