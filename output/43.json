    "content": "FELIX\nPROFILE\nPHILIP ALLSOPP It is probably not realised in I.C. how unusual it may seem to outsiders, and to past members of the College, that a student from the West Indies should be President of Guilds'. To have been elected to this job, a Colonial would have to be either a violent calypso showman - or the opposite. That he is the latter says much for the health of the system. _ _\nA year ago, a correspondent to FELIX,\" concerned about\nthe methods of electing Union Officers, put forward the opinion that the President of I.C. should be elected by general vote, so that everyone got the leaders they deserved. It was presumed that this was what the individual; Colleges got with such a method; the sagacity of the Guilds' is heartening. They chose a man this year who was not prominent in any sport or such popular activity, who was\nserious in debate, and yet was to prove a fine leader of his College. lt was a murky day in September 1949 when Philip first chuckled to himself on English soil. He came with the definite intentions of learning about roads and seeing Europe. From his home in British Guiana he brought a fine grey hat to protect his hair from the elements while he accomplished his two tasks. After a week he discovered that the rain never stopped reliably, and so he put away\nhis homburg er until the Brighton run,....., His first achievement a tI.C. was breaking two fingers for the SoccerClub. He now concentrates on the social side of college life, saying that England is too cold for any athletics, except perhaps cricket. For his work as Secretary of the Overseas Students Committee last year, he was one of the first to receive the Union General Award;\nand he is going to buy a blazer one day to commemorate the event. He has been Assistant Editor, and is now Editor, of the Guilds' Engineer. Philip's knowledge of Europe, a qui red through wide\ntravel, is the envy of many of us. He has done vacation work in Holland and Scandinavia, and the welcome he got in Norway was staggering. His employers, the State Railways, allowed him free travelling, and as a result of a profile in a newspaper a benevolent lady gave him all his meals. His wanderings took him to a remote village in Northern Norway which had never before been visited by a coloured man, and he was too great aeon nter attraction to the school until cooperation between the two was thought of, and he\ngave a talk to the children. Incidentally, he has been\nreported, on another occasion, to have talked With a German\nprofessor about Autobahnen in IATIN I The considerable va rie oy and balance of his activities is reflected in his character. Philip inclines to be\nquiet and retiring rather than push ful, but he is not a man\nof few words. He can talk for whole Union meeting_ on any\nsubject, without notes, and without digression. He does\nnot actively force discussions towards his own set opinion, but he uses his soft, in exhaust able voice to great effect in making a point clear against the happy hecklers in the Guilds'. Phil iF will lead the College anywhere, anytime, provided he is persuaded that the majority really want to go\nthat way, and that he is not just listening to the agitating few. .\nHis interests outside college work and duties are too many to catalogue. His tastes in music are strictly classical he revels in Mozart opera. But his chief enjoyment lies in being with people, sharing their jokes and telling his, end delighting everyone with his joie de\nviv re. One thing we have not heard from Philip Allsopp yet is a true calypso. We hope that his persistent refusal to sing will be broken at the Christmas Carnival. SURVEY OF WOMEN'S COLLEGES.

I feel it my duty after more than two years of successful bus catching to place the fruits of my experience before my frozen fellows of the bus queue. Here then are the seven basic methods of boarding a bus during the rush hour.1. The kerbs te p:aste p sideways Into the road, forcing the bus to stop some way out. Rundown the alley between bus and queue.( Not in foggy weather: see Coroner's notes on B. Thomas).2. The left hook: run right round the far side of j bus, clockwise and enter from the rear.|3. The feint: move forward and pretend to try to' get on the wrong bus. Those waiting for yourI proper bus will be fooled, and will allow you to stay at the head of the queue.( Make sure you dont j get on the wrong one). \u20224. The foreigner: charge in, scarf in brown bag, pretending to speak no English.5. The menace: walk to the head of the queue with a friend. Remark that you feel another attack of typhoid coming on. Spit a little blood.6. The innocent: wait in a doorway for your bus. Then rush up to the conductor and ask which bus goes to your destination. When he says\" This one; mate,\" fight vainly to get off again.( Make sure the fight is in vain).7. Queue normally: but watch that old lady who comes to stand near you, at the head, then steps smartly on the bus, assisted by a conductor who\nsym pathis es about\" those college tough s.\"He re'sto a happy( bus mans) holiday.

    "content": "FELIX\nChristmas( Lott c&rt The I.C. Musical Society Christmas Concert\nwas given in Q.A. H. on December 4 th. On the whole, the items were well performed\nand well received. However, Dr. Jacques' hero,\nBach, did not receive a worthy performance. The\nCantata No. 61 was the opening work and the\nOrchestra came trough well. The choir and\nsoloists did not. The choir's singing was not up;\nto standard, it being difficult to distinguish the\nwords. Corelli' s Christmas Concerto followed, beautifully played by an Orchestra of 10 strings. After a slow introduction, the violins breezed\ninto something resembling Mantovani. The latter movements of this work were, to my mind, the\nbest part of the evening. Aft art his, carols. The \u00bbaudience were\nsint ahL v' amused by Dr. Jacques* glance before the Holly and the Ivy, and sang, more or less; as\ndirected. Those carols performed by the choir alone were also well sung. Finally Vaughan Williams1 Sea Symphony.\nThis was the first time I had heard this work,\nand it is therefore difficult to write anything\nabout it. The choir sang at its best, bal anc^ was good, the words came through (most of them )\nand the soloists were both magnificent. Miss Holly well deserved her position next to William Parsons. There is no doubt about the succes of these concerts. The hall was practically full and the audience obviously enjoyed it. It was\nquite obvious that the choir did as well. Certainly, Dr. Jacques is a popular conductor\nand I.C. is very lucky to have him, both as\nconductor and lecturer. Finally, I would like to say a word about\nI.C. orchestra. This has fallen badly in numbers\nand may have to cease altogether. This is not\nthe fault of the Musical Society, but of those\npeople in I.C. who play instruments but do\nnot come forward. There are plenty of string players in I.G. and if they do get together it will be worth their while. Do please do some-thing. Making music is more satisfying than just listening.( The first meeting next term will be on\nJanuary15 t h).A.D. A.N.U.S. GIVES UP The Council of the National Union of Students, meeting ing right on a fortnight ogo,\nto\u00a5k, with some regrets, a definite step away from\nthe International Union. .\nFor several years, there has been dissatisfaction in N.U.S. with the overwhelming\npolitics of the I \u00bb U.S. and their dogma that international unity meant primarily political unity. In 1948, I.C. cut its last ties with the\nN.U.S. bee use it did not think that sort of\naffiliation worth supporting. Eighteen months ago\nthe N.U.S. placed itself down to\" associate membership\" of the International Union, hop in e that the executive of I.U.S. in Prague would allow\nsuch a contact to remain,whereby N.U.S. could still take part in social and student affairs, but have\nno share in the I.U.S. as a political machine,\nHowever, no action was taken to meet the\nEnglish conception of such student activity, and the vote of 820 \u2022- 420 at Brighton was to conf irma ruling that N.U.S. was automatically out of I.U.S. by default of action by the latter. Contacts will be maintained in hope, but it is possibly now that the massive N.U.S. debates and\nrefer end i on thi^ political subject can give way\nto urgent national business. It has always been the regret of many student\nbodies, in England and Wales that the only national association was fe o busy with one problem.Some have\nfelt, from tine to time,that their affiliation was\nnot worth the cost, and have been inclined to\nfollow I.C. out. These will be comforted by the\nappeal of many speakers at the council, including the new President, for more attention to domestic\nmatters - grants, welfare, vacation work, etc. UNIVERSITY LITERARY SOCIETY\nIn view of the almost phenomenal support given to previous functions, the University Literary Society is pressing on with several new\nventures this session. A magazine is to be pub-li shed shortly, devoted entirely to writing by\nmembers of the University; work of any sort whatsoever from the College will be welcomed, cont ri but ions to be sent to Arnold Rosen, c/ oU.L.U.,30 Woburn Square, W.C.1. Beside this, arrangements are being made for discussions between\nmembers and writers of established reputation, wh w are not too long in the tooth to be out of S5*y \u00abf>i il% with undergraduate outlook.\n\u00a3 et te*& to. the Edit m Dear Sir,\nMr, Fisher thinks that a page in FELIX devoted to\nU.L. activities should have the precedence to the sports\npage if lack of space prevents the inclusion of both\ntea fares. Mr Fisher rightly assesses the world situation as\ngrave. The remedy he xu gg est s, namely 'a resurgence\nof critical and constructive thought in mankind\" is a well sounding phrase with vacuum behind it.\nWe have a lot of cr nt J val and constructive thought\ngoing on. What is lacking in the world to-day is\nto 1era nee and good will.\nTo promote tolerance and good will we have to be\nprimarily interested in people and their problems. We\ncan practice that splendidly at I.C,, To take part in the activities of U.L. means a lot\nof time, '.i 'hose who fully participate in the life of\nI.C often cannot afford it. It does not mean that\nthey do not work towards the objectives Mr. Fisher is\nrather vaguely worrying about.\nHe also suggest that to practice sport is to be\ndirectly preventing understanding in the world.\nSomething is seriously wrong with someone's reasoning\nhere!\nTo practice any form of sport the way we see it is\nll o develop those very qualities which if present all\nover the world, would make for better understanding\namong nations.\nAt sport we train to achieve our objects by fair\nmeans, with courage and zeal. We learn team work and\ninward discipline. We learn to know one another. We\nhave, no language barriers. That is very important.\nactivities.''I am merely saying that they will never be\ngenerally topical at I.C., We will not lose atm thing by that.

    "content": "fiE LIX CHRISTMAS STORY.\nOnce upon a time there was a poor woodcutter, who\nlived in a forest, who had three sons, Arks, As sega i and\nAr res em. One day the eldest so n,Arks, said to his. father, \"The time has come for me to go into the world to seek fame end fortune.\" So he packed up his few belo ig in gs and set out. After many adventures he came to a wide road, lined with tall buildings. Entering one of these, he was looking round curiously, when he found himself in the grip of a monster. In terror he said, meant no ham, monster. Who\nare you s nd what do you want?\"\" I am the Prof\" the monster replied. \"And now you are my slave. But if you work well for me, at the end of two years I will set you free and, besides, give you a Ph.D.\" So poor Arks was set to work building a monstrous\napparatus to determine the o ir cura bend ability of old boots and slaved over it for many months. Constantly The Prof found fault with it, and many times Arks despaired of ever seeing his brothers again. Now The Prof's lair was guarded\nby a female dragon, small as dragons go, but armed with a sharp tongue and a cutting manner which could wound a man at thirty paces. Furthermore, Arks, who had learned that Ph.Ds. were rolls of parchment inscribed with magic writing of great power, had also found that they were kept in the bottom\nright hand drawer of The Prof's desk. And it seemed to Arks that if he could only become friendly with the dragon, it might let him enter The Prof's lair in his absence, remove a Ph.D., and escape. So he plied it with such things as he thought acceptable to dragons - invitations to dances\nand dinners, to see his etchings but to no avail. He was1 almost in despair when it occurred to him that the dragon\ni might well be a beautiful maiden under as pella common \"\nenough thing after all and, as everyone knows, such spells can usually be broken by a kiss. So one day, after disarming i suspicion by offering it some typing, for which it had a voracious appetite, he cautiously kissed it. Whereupon it knocked him clean into the middle of his apparatus, saying it was not that kind of dragon. The Prof was so furious when he \u00ab aw the damage that he turned Arks into stone with one glance, and poor Arks Is now the95 th statue to the. r:g ht on the Albert Memorial. When As sega i, the second son, grew up, he too set out\nt> seek his fortune, and after many wanderings he too was\ncaught by The Prof and set to work repairing the monstrous\napparatus to determine the o irc umb end ability of old boots,'. 'he Prof disapproved of everything he did, and in his turn he began to feel his only chance of getting a Ph.D. was to i teal one. So he set out to make friends with the dragon - i lending it books, talking about its operation, and offering suggestions on how to make its den more comfortable. The\ndragon seemed pleased, and quite frequently did not breathe fire at him for days on end, but it never relaxed its vigilance. Then it occurred to him to wonder if the dragon was\nreally bewitched, and if anything could be done about it. So one day he kissed it, but alas! he too was knocked into the middle of his apparatus, the dragon saying he was as bad\ni as. the rest of them, and breathing flame all over him. When\nThe Prof returned he was in a great rage, and As sega i is now\nthe96 th statue on the right on the Albert Memorial. When it was time for Ar res em, the youngest son, to seek his fortune, his father tried to persuade him to stay at home, since nothing had ever been heard of his brothers l once they had left. But Arresem insisted on leaving, and\nsure enough, he was caught by The Prof, and set to work,\nAr res em, poor chap, actually became interested in the c irc umb end ability of old boots, and tried hard to please, but\nfared no better than his brothers. He was very lonely, for naturally his fellow slaves were not going to talk to a man\n;whose chief to pio of conversation was old boots, so he fell into the habit of visiting the dragon, and listening to it talk about the young men it had had for supper the night before and such things, and little by little, they became\nclose friends. One day he came upon the dragon crying bitterly and found out that it had inadvertently breathed fire over a young man it had been saving up for a tasty snack, and charred him to a cinder.\" Poor thing, don't cry,\" he said, and kissed it sympathetically. To his amazement, the dragon turned into a beautiful maiden, who fell on his neck crying\" At last!. At last l\" \"You see,\" she explained later,\" I was uni era spell which could not be broken until I was kissed three times. Your brothers, I may add, discourage very easily.\" Then she told him about the F h.Ds. in the bottom right hand drawer of The Prof's desk. She explained it could only be opened by magic and told him exactly how to go about it. When The Prof found what had .happened to his dragon, he merely raised one eyebrow, waved his magic slide rule, and there was the dragon back again! but the maiden and Ar res em had expected him to do this and were not alarmed. Meanwhile, Arresem built a little fire, and put a stew-pot on it, and\ns at by it playing his violin. When The Prof realised what\nwas happening, he rushed from his lair, crying, \"What is going on? I will not have it in my -. laboratory!\" The dragon then slipped into the lair and\nwaited. When the sound of fiddling and the smell of cooking reached . the bottom right hand drawer it flew open, and there was a Ph.D. inscribed with Ar res em's name! The dragon took lit up, and, evading The Prof,it and Arresem na de their escape. As soon as they were safely away, Arresem kissed the dragon three times, skilfully dodging its claws the while, when itOI Ee more turned into the beautiful maiden, and they were married and lived happily ever after. And the moral of this is that beautiful maidens only behave like dragons for the first two kisses. Jonathan Staggers. BAR BALLADS, NO.I. A Legend of R.C.S.

This one falls into such a category' J ho Editor rs \u00bb rots that he had to edit it a little. woman \u2014the unpredictable element\nSymbol is 0 0\nGroup Thought to be\nOccurrence a member of a family. Seldom found in a pure state. Pure specimens assume a rosy tint when discovered in the natural state. Surface usually covered by a film of paint or oxide. Generally found in the immediate vicinity of flourishing economic situations, exact position unpredictable( see Heisenberg,\" Uncertainty Principle\") Rich deposits are occasionally found more often lost. Physical Properties Boils at nothing, freezes without reason. All varieties melt with careful handling( CARS fumes readily). Density is not as great as generally exposed. Very bitter if used incorrectly. Odour always present, maybe fragrant or pungent. Unpolished specimen tends to turn green in presence of a highly polished one. Chemical Properties Highly explosive and dangerous except inexperienced hands. Ages rapidly, with polymer is ation. Possesses great affinity for Ag,A u,P t and for C of high density. Activity is greatly increased when saturated with a spirit solution. A very powerful reducing agent e.g. of bank balances, also of peroxides in the case of dark specimens. Vast quantities of proteins, carbohydrates etc. are rapidly consumed( trial of this experiment can prove economically prohibitive). Under suitable conditions will form complexes. Various types are described in the literature. They occur in numerous crystal habits and atleast one amorphous form. All are functionally similar, varying only in outward appearances which maybe deceptive,( n.b. the exception is the behaviour toward Cg H5OH which is then a useful form of classification.) Uses Chiefly ornamental. Acts rapidly as a catalyst( negative or positive) in the production of fevers. Widely used in biology. It is illegal in most countries to possess more than one specimen though a certain amount of exchange is permissible. Summary Older chemists had difficulty in classifying this element of such wide occurrence. Application of the Do be reiner Triads leads to the concept of the eternal triangle. Even the current extensive knowledge fails to explain all properties, e.g. radioactivity strongly evident at about2 p.m. K.F. J.T.

In each subject50 marks constitutes a Pass. The boy's lowest mark is45, and his highest mark is in Mathematics; he fails in French, but obtains64 marks in English, and56 marks in another subject. In Mr. Davies' subject he obtains one and a halftimes as many marks as he does in the subject for which the master who lives at Ealing is responsible; and his average mark is57 \u00bb\nMr. Andrews, the youngest of the masters, lives at Richmond, and the master in whose subject the boy obtains56 marks lives on the opposite side of the river to Mr. Andrews. Mr. Andrews' nearer neighbour on the same side of the river is younger than Mr. Davies; his nearer neighbour on the opposite side of the river is younger than Mr. Bailey, but older than Mr. Elliot. Mr. Chapman and the Science master live on opposite sides of the river, The ages of the French and the Science masters are respectively the same as the boys' marks in Science and in French; and the ages of the other th reo masters are respectively the same as one of the boy's marks, one of the boy's marks with the digits reversed, and the average age of the five masters.

Contact with the main student body is desired on this matter, to obtain some ideas of your opinions. The Refectory suggestions books are always available for such comment. Opinions on\nthe provision of hot snacks in the New Lounge are also wanted. The Bar came in for a good deal of discussion, principally concerning a reduction in the price of whisky, the provision of pins of stronger ales, and the display of cigarettes and potato crisps. A Wine Committee is to study possible additions to the range of drinks sold. Regarding Ayrton Hall, it was emphasised that the congestion which occurs at12.30 on\nTuesdays and Thursdays could be largely relieved if people would arrive earlier. The 1 2 - 1 2 . 3 0\nperiod is usually slack. I he prices fixed in Ayrton Hall by the committee are slightly higher than those in the Union, but this is considered justified by the superior character of the meal. No satisfactory solution to the noisy metal tray problem was reached, but it was felt that they were better than plastic ones. The stuffed animals on the walls of the Lower Dining Hall are to be\nremoved. The Upper Dining Hall is to remain open during the Vacation. "

DECEMBER 1952\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nNo.43\nEDIT ORlAJl.BRAY CIRCULATION: 1250\nThere Is no excuse, in a Christmas Issue full of fun, for a weighty Editorial column, and indeed, writing in the foggy aftermath of a foggier party and dance, we are quite incapable of thought. The Editor wishes it to be recorded in this column that he deeply appreciates the prodigious labours of Mess r s.Wear ne, Purser, Wardle, Benson, Anderson, Star mer, Edwards, Morgan, Kale, Midgley, Piggott, D add, Gill( the M.C.), the Entertainments Committee, and all the others who helped to make\nthe FELIX Dance something of a sue ces s despite the weather. COMPETITION RESULT\nWhere the blue pencil blue-pen oil is my blue pencil blue-pencil?\nHats Off, gentlemen to\" Rafe\", whose limerick, unprintable by edict of the Lord Chancellor, swept the other29 contributions away from the limelight. The official winner is W. G.H.,C.& a.\" There was a Young Lady of Bude, Is a line which should not be pursued For I.C. in its crudity At once thinks of nudity, A subject, by FELIX, tabooed. Many others used a similar treatment, notably L. S.G., who says.\" But, Oh Boy', what there' ll be\nIn the ones you wont see, For they' ll be most subtly construed.\" There were several near misses. J. A. Lusher failed, as many did, on the last line. He was the\nbest. rh y m ster, with eschewed, panic, organic. and\nvi wwe d. Most competitors produced the obvious rhymes. M.W. Knil l sent in a baker's dozen, and his first, slightly ungrammatical, was ingenious and almost a winner.\" There was a Young Lady of Bude, With spirit so fierce was imbued, When she came up to college To assimilate knowledge Was distilled and the liq ru or drunk crude.\"\" Teapot\".\" Prof a num Vulgaris\"\" Burp\" J. W.S.,\" AJax\"( Who produced a subtle one), and Watt a. Wordsworth all contributed fair limerick. The\nThe \" Four Met Types\" were rather near the limit, and, but for making\" light\" rhyme wi Hi\"De light\", would have won.\nThe number of noms de plume, unaccompanied by full names, was a startling feature. We can only]\nsuppose that a few staid and elderly professorial reputations hide behind them. The complete entry can be seen on application! to the Editor. Several of the more serious articles submitted for publication have been held over until the next issue, owing\nto shortage of space. I0H CE THE SIR ARTHUR ACLAUD ENGLISH ESSAY PRIZE. 1953\nThe object of the Competition is to encourage good\nwriting of English, and is restricted to undergraduates, but students may submit essays written as part of the Final Examinations in the previous year. A candidate must submit\nan original English essay not exceeding5,000 on any subject, but a scientific or technological subject must be treated in an on specialized way. A Prize of25 guineas will be\nawarded for the best essay, provided a sufficient standard is reached. The Award will be presented on Commemoration\nDay. Essays must reach the Registrar not later than January 1 8 th.1953. Viewpoint SPELLING\nIm called upon to reply to critics of my\nspelling in the Union Library series of articles. To deny my right to conduct a private crusade is surely unfair: nobody questions the right of a writer to use his own - style in FELIX, and modernised punctuation is part of my style. I adopt it because I think its time for the use of condensed words to be more widely recognised. To illustrate my belief, consider the word \" can't\". Although nearly99.9?* of the people of England habitually say\" cant\", without a suggestion of it being really two words, only my enlightened self and the late Mr. Shaw have the courage to do anything about it in print. Our language is constantly developing; Chaucer and Shakespear are among the millions who have\nhelped to raise it to a unique position, as far as\nrichness and diversity of expression are concerned. At the moment the most potent force in language reconstruction comes from Whitehall; the tongue is in danger of becoming officious and stilted with ministerial platitudes and evasions. Surely a simplifying tendency like mine has some value as an antidote to this deadly danger? Regarding punctuation, I try to be orthodox, especially regard in d possessive apostrophes, as their use is often essential to correct under st standing of the sense. It is rather frustrating to be\na ccc sed of inconsistency by people who fail to differentiate between the two types of apostrophe the possessive and the abbrev i at ive. In spelling, I occasionally miss out redundant vowels they ll go\non to the end of time if somebody doesnt do something about it. Ien dev or to achieve a closer relationship between spoken English and prose than has so far been achieved by the reactionary writers of history. Modernised spelling is, of course far neater in print than is the old style. A flexible attitude, but nevertheless a sensible one. restrained and dignified, is in my opinion the best way of retaining a living language. Language is the property of the common man. If he cares tomis conjugate a verb for long enough it will eventually become accepted as standard English. Words in ordinary usage mean, not what the dictionary dictates, but what the ordinary man has decided they will mean. You may fight against him in the\" Times\" and in your treatises on grammar, but he\nwill win in the end.Am I in error to have made a step in his direction? A.R.B. U.L. U. DEBATE per\nOn November 28th the House, assembled in the U.L. U. Hut, preferred Pigs to Politics by 31 votes to16. There were sharp exchanges overt ne motives of Enid Shuttlebaura*s Society fort ne preservation of mangold w orz els but on the whole there was more sympathy for the pig, in the restricted availability of its products, than for the politician who is responsible for such travesties as spam\nand the a pella tion\" hotdog s\". The pig was also extolled for such virtues, unknown in politicians, as honesty, contented ne ss and sincerity. On November 21st an almost empty House carried the motion that \"The Art of Invective should be revived\" by\n14-6 votes, after only one speech from the floor, by a member of Westfield College. One would ex nBc ta supposedly intelligent University to debate more important ideas that these, but that two\nsuch frivolous debates should be held successively was due\nto the protagonists being unable to agree on the motion originally planned for the20 th. ULU COUNCIL The second meeting of the new U.L. U. Council of Presidents on the l st December was largely devoted to finance and implementing the new constitution( see FELIX of last February) The Presidents Report and those of the three main committees\ntwo minor financial items, and the confirmation of Standing OrderB for the management of various sections of the Union were got through in an hour and a half. The new Council is more of a policy body than the old, and t lw meetings are getting more businesslike than the rambling debates we have known.\nMINES BALL\nThe Mines Ball took place on Wednesday 2 7 th November.\nFor a mid-week function the numbers were fairly good.\nThanks to the keen helpers the gymnasium was transformed by subtle decoration into si me warmth and intimacy and\neveryone appeared to be enjoying themselves. At one\nthe band went home but a number stayed on and danced to records. Mike West was a very smooth M.C. and Brian Fen hou let is to be congratulated on organising the affair with the usual Mines s a voire faire. "

Second Round.\nI.C.28 Northern Polytechnic\u20143.\nThiB game was played on a treacherous wet surface\nwith a north wind blowing sleet and rain the length of\nthe ground. Starting against the wind I.C. looked a faster\nand better side than their opponents and were first to score\nthrough an Unconverted try by Coppelman. Northern Poly,\nreplied with a try, but just before half-time Hearn touched\ndown a kick ahead to regain the lead. In the second half\nthe college quite overwhelmed the visitors; making full use\nof the conditions by incessant long kicks down field. There\nwas some good play by the back, although attempts at handling were a waste of time. On several occasions a tackled\nthree-qu tir ter was able to release the ball and get a foot to\nit to start a rush. Six more tries were scored; one of the\nbest coming when Groves, who had followed up a diagonal kick\nby Hykin, was able to. gather a fortunate bounce at full speed\nThe scorers were Groves (3), Crossley (2), Cbppelman, Hearn\nand Hykin. Robinson made two conversions in spite of the\nmud.\nI.C. are clearly capable of retaining the University\nCup if they play in tell e gently, and choose the correct\ntactics in succeeding rounds. The keen support for the\nfour lower XV's ensures a number of good reserves on the\nfringe of the first team as an insurance against injuries.\nThe semi-finals are not until Feb. 18th when I.C. play\nWye College, and Q.M.

Squash Cup ia contested with only three\nplayers; this se cond round looked like a really hard\nfight, with St. Mary's playing the U.L. captain as their\nfirst string, and with I.C. playing three Varsity men,\nJ. Kenyon, A. A. Williams, and M.D. Martin.\nThe third pair went into the court first, and proved\nto be the most interesting squash, from the gallery point\nof view. The first two games brought out some excellent\nsquash, but Mike Martin then found a good length on his\ncorner drives, and alternating with side-mil drop shots,\nsoon had his opponent very exhausted; he eventually won,\nstill appearing very nra ch fresher than the St.Mary's No.3.\nby 3 games to 1.\nA. A. Williams did not get much opportunity to use his\n'disguised wrist-shots' ; his opponent was somewhat of as logger, with the result that the game did not prove very\ninteresting to watch, a great pity because Tony Williams'\nsubtle play is usually very impressive. He won by 3 games\nto 1, without appearing at all pressed.\nJohn Garfield, the U.L. captain, was in excellent form\nand proved too much for Jeff Kenyon, who lost in three\nstraight games. Garfield's corner drives were ir re tri eva ble, and his side-court drives so are ely left the sidewalls at all. This match was again disappointing, for had\nJeff Kenyon been 'on-form' we would have seen some first-class squash.\nI.C. Table Tennis Club.\nThe Club competes in the U.L. TableTennis league, the l st( Champions) and 2nd Teams playing in the Premier Division. The\n3rd Team is in the Second Division. The sea stra has started fairly. well, and\nseveral useful new players have been discovered.\nWith Miller captaining the University Team, the l st Team has done well to win all its matches to date, gaining 9 pts out of a possible 12. The 3rd Team has done equally\nwell, with 10 pts out of 12, but the 2nd Team has\nbeen unfortunately unable to obtain a point so far. MORPHY DAY\nThe date for Morphy Day next year has been fixed for\nWednesday 18th. November, 1953.\nWe apologize to two members of Lowry Race crews whose names\nwere misprinted sM.C.

C. fought their way into the semi-final of the\nU.L. Hockey Cup competition by a convincing victory over\nKing's College on Wednesday,26th. Novemberof six goals\nto one.The match was played almost throughout in a cold\ndriving drizzle but the standard of hockey was surprisingly good.\nThe first ten minutes were critical for I.e., but\nthe defence stood up to the test well,and from then on\nthe half-back line gradually gained control of the game.\nConsequently,in the second half the I.C. forwards were\nkept well supplied with passes and proved too much for\nthe King's defence.The first four goals were scored by\nLatter,Power,and John Smith(2),and the fifth was the\nresult of a demonstration by Forster of how a penalty\ncorner should be taken.King's struck back and scored\nbut I. Chad the last word when Haye3 went through and\nscored from the edge of the circle.\nThe semi-final will be played on February 4th. when we shall probably meet our old foes,University\nCollege,who at present have the Cup in their possession.\nWe are looking forward to relieving them of this\nresponsibility.\nResults.\nSaturday,29th.

Unf\nfortunately the same cannot be said of the second XI\nwhich is having a very lean season. There appears to be\ndespondency in the team and until this is. got rid of\nthe games will continue to be lost. A contributory factor\nto this apathetic condition is probably the difficulties\nexperienced by the club officials in selecting teams.\nAn availability list is in operation and correct use of\nthis should ensure that there are no crossings off but\nrecently last minute withdrawals have had disastrous effects as a quick glance at the record shows.\nFirst XI\nSecond XI\nThird XI\nP WDL For Against\nII 4 2 5 31 30\n12\n8\n10 22 46\n2 38 20\nI.C.

Almost eau ally stirring\nis Arthur Koestlers \"Darkness a two on\", an account\nof the Moscow trials, containing an unforgettable\npicture of pitiless electric lamps and the inhuman\nmethod of theoretical fetishists.
