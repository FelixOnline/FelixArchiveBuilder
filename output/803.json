    "content": "pe view Adrian\nBourne 1r X0 T0R Ayrton Senna's mistake 12 laps from\nthe flag in last Sunday's Monaco\nGrand Prix, when he crashed into a barrier while holding a50 second\nlead, has given the World\nChampionship advantage (both\npoints-wise and psychologically) to\nhis McLaren team mate Alain Prost.\nThe most successful driver of all\ntime, Prost won his 30th Grand Prix\nand his 4th Monaco victory in the last\n5 years in a rather unsatisfactory\nmanner. Prost has been out-qualified\nin all 3 Grand Prix this season by\nSenna quite easily and start line mistakes lost him the race at the Imola\nand should have cost him victory in\nMonte Carlo. Yet the fact is that he\nleads Senna by 15 points and\nMcLaren are yet to suffer a mechanical retirement (Senna was\ndisqualified in Brazil). This reliability\nalone should enable Prost to finish at\nleast 2nd in every race and as long as\nhe wins a few more he should be\nworld champion for the third time.\nUnlike football, where the complete\nunderdogs can beat a much more\nexpensive team, Formula One is ruled\nalmost exclusively by the\ncheque book. The big spenders at the\nmoment are Honda, Philip Morris\n(Marlboro) and RJ Reynolds\n(Camel). I say almost exclusively\nbecause Lotus are again proving that\nin the modern era they are the big\nlosers. Since the death of founder\nColin Chapman in 1982 Lotus have\ngone downhill in a big way and much\nof the credit for this must go to team\nmanager Pete Warr. His latest\nmasterstroke was signing world\nchampion Nelson Piquet, the arrogant\nBrazilian who has resorted to making\ncheap jibes about other drivers private\nlives in Playboy rather than\nconcentrate on his (very slow)\ndriving. He would do Fl a great\nfavour if he packed up, shut up and\nwent home.\nBOOKSThe Grey Horse\nRA MacAvoy\nThis simple tale of simple Irish folk\nturned out to be a little too simple for\nmy liking. The plot itself is very\nstraightforward, a man, Rory\nMacEever, wants to win the heart of,\nand then marry a young girl, Mary\nStanton. Not really the kind of thing\nyou might expect of a popular writer\nwhose works are generally found\namongst the science fiction or fantasy\nsection of bookshops. Well there is\na little more to the story. Mary is a nationalist, the kind of radical\nprotagonist which the South West\ncorner of Ireland might well\naccommodate. The real kick comes\nfrom Rory though. He is a horse (yes\na grey one), or to be more exact, a horse fairy who turns into a man on\noccasion and gallops around the\nhillsides the rest of the time.\nThe fairly subtle sub-plot of father\nand estranged son being reunited is\nnot only a touch obvious but very\nclich ed. In fact the only surprise in\nthe book is how quickly the characters\ncome to accept a magical creature in\ntheir midst. Perhaps the Irish are like\nthat\u2014I don't know.\nDespite these complications and\nsubstructures, the events develop\nrather too slowly, perhaps an attempt\nby the author to recreate the\ntimelessness of the country, which is\nusually claimed by the Irish Tourist\nBoard. The frequent Gaelic references\nI found confusing and distracting and\ndid little for the authenticity of the\nstory, a shame since this is no doubt\nthe reason for their inclusion.\nRA MacAgoy has received several\nawards and nominations for her\nwriting, and I can only assume that\nshe has done better in the past. If you\nlike horses and simple tales though,\nyou might like this book.\nThe Grey Horse is published today\nby Bantam, and is \u00a32.95.\nAndrew Clarke.\nCookery Club\nA Summer festival\n1 always look forward to the Summer\nbecause strawberries are available in\nabundance to make my favourite\nmousse.\nStrawberry Mousse\nIngredients:\n500g fresh strawberries\n50g(2oz) caster sugar\n4 t bl sp water\nV2 pint double cream\n2 egg whites\nMethod:\nPuree fruit\nDissolve gelatine into water\nPour gelatine into puree\nBlend together\nPour in whisked cream\nWhisk the eggs and blend into the\nmixture\nSet the mousse in the freezer\ncompartment\nThe mousse takes about 2 hours to\nset. Take care not to freeze it solid.\nMove it into the ref ridge rat or as soon\nas it has set.\nIf you want to make this mousse it\nis well worth taking the trouble to\nborrow a blender. You will love the\ntangy, slightly sweet, but creamy\nresult that this recipe produces. You\nmight like to try substituting\nraspberries for strawberries.\nFormer junior Swiss\nwrestling champion quits\nthe Dorchester\nThe world of food is as much about\nthe people who cook in it as it is about\nthe food itself.\nAnton Mossiman retired recently\nfrom the Dorchester Hotel after\nheading a posse of 80 chefs for many\nyears. He has opened a restaurant off\nBelgrave Square where he hopes to\ncarry on pleasing the palate.\nHe is regarded by many as the\nfinest chef in England since the great\nEscofier. Anton has helped to\npromote bread and butter pudding\nfrom the status of mere s tod ge to that\nof a regal pudding. I hope to include\nhis recipe for this classic pu d in a future issue of FELIX.\nGreece & Cyprus\nThe City of Thessaloniki\nL Patsiolou and K Yamalidou of\nChem Eng were kind enough to give\ntips on areas of the city where the\ngood Greek tavern as are to be found.\n1) The castle\nThe areas around the ancient Roman\ncastle and the village within it offer\nan excellent assortment of tavern as where Greek food must be eaten. If\nyou have any fears of Greek food this\nwould be the time to forget them and\neat like a glutton for you will have a difficult time finding better value food\nanywhere else in Europe. You might\nbe lucky enough to find a tavern a that\noffers a spectacular view of the port\ncity from a vantage point in the castle.\n2) The Olympus-Naoussa area (city\ncentre)\nRogottis\u2014This establishment is\nfamous amongst the locals for its juicy\n's out zo uk a kia'. The girls insist that\nthis local delicacy cannot be missed\nfor the world.\nThe city outskirts\n3) The locality of Krini-Kalamaria\nClose to Krini is the expensive\nluxurious tavern a of Krikelas. A meal\nhere would be recommended to those\nwho are prepared to spend between\n\u00a310-15 per head inclusive of service\nand wine.\n4) The locality of Nea Mihaniona\nand Epanomi\n5) The village of Panorama\nHere the tavern as offer the much\nloved 'trig ono' which must be had as\ndessert with any meal you might try.\nAll the areas that I have mentioned\ncan be reached by bus from the city\ncentre. It would be a good idea to try\nGreek seafood dishes if you go to a tavern a in an area near the sea, but\nfurther inland the 'Souvlaki' (kebab)\nmeat preparations might be prefer ed. The Island of Corfu\nIt might be sensible to avoid Corfu in\nthe peak of summer, but if you\nventure this far you certainly must not\nmiss a meal at Georgo's tavern a in\nMessongi. The Moussaka, the\nBarbouni (red mullet), the\nMassoroonatha do Foumou (oven\nbaked macaroni cheese) are the\noutstanding dishes to be tried. A meal\nhere will cost a paltry \u00a3 1 . 5 0 .\nDr Toumazou warns that Cyprus\nwill be more expensive than the Greek\nislands but that is never any reason\nto miss out on good food.\nThe places to look out for are:\nTaverna Aphrodite, Limassol\u2014The\nKleftico (leg of lamb) and the\n'Aphelia' (chunks of meat marinated\nin wine) are two masterpieces and\nshould cost about \u00a33 per head.\nTaverna Salamis, Ayia Napa\u2014The\nSouvlaki and the Galamari (squid)\nshould be tried.\nWe have come far since leaving the\nleafy lanes of London but before our\ngastronomic itinerary moves\nwestward I will be giving food tips\nfrom Athens and the Aegean islands.\nI am indebted to those who provided\nthe info that made this article possible.\nBye for now,\nYishu.\n10 Friday May 20th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "F1\nEE LI\n(t7 \u2014 \u2014 \u2022 - JIt occured to me today that perhaps\nI was getting a little too involved with\nthe 'Snack Bar saga\". Certainly this\nweek, with the bitter feuding on both\nsides, I have found myself slipping\nfurther and further towards the 'Snack\nBar staff side'. I no longer feel able\nto comment independently on the\nevents in the Union and the shambles\nof an Annual General Meeting we had\nyesterday.\nIt is for this reason that I have asked\nlast year's FELIX Editor David\nJones, who was also present at the\nAGM. to write a guest editorial this\nweek.\nJust before I go, I'd like to say a big thank you to the five people who\nturned up to collate last night and\neverybody who has rallied around me\nthis week. I love you all.\nI suppose it was just one IC UGM too\nmany. Like the compulsive gambler\nwho puts his last pound on the 33:1\nshot but knows in his heart that he's pouring money away, or the alcoholic\nwho can't put the glass down though\nhe knows it's killing him, somehow\nI believed this one might be different.\nWhat kind of a fool am I? After a close involvement with\nFELIX and the Union, it has been\ndisconcerting to have to watch the\ngoings on inside Beit Quad as an\noutsider. Perhaps that change of\nperspective has been significant, but\nthis year the Union seems to have\nhauled itself onto a new level of\ncollective absurdity. Hands up if you\nagree with the people from St Mary's. And those who disagree. That's a far\nsmaller number....\nThe crass behaviour of all but the\nmost level-headed students is par for\nthe course, but it's especially galling\nwhen there was at least one item of\nbusiness that needed as much\ndiscussion as time and/or legal\nconsiderations would allow.\nHopefully the Union as a whole will\nbe given a full account of the major\ntrading imbalances in the Bar and\nSnack Bar when the matter has been\nresolved. The only thing which came\nout of yesterday's hot air session was\nthat among the mightier members of\nthis shitty students union there are\nsome personal grudges which run\nvery deep indeed.\nAnd the biggest personality clash\nof all? Ian and Alan may not be best\nof friends anymore, but it's Howgate\nversus Hackney which has been at the\nforefront of Union in-fighting for\nmost of the year.\nOr at least, that is what everyone\nseems to think. I 've been looking\nthrough this year's back issues of\nFELIX recently, and there really isn't much evidence of the anti-Howgate\nhate campaign. There are one or two\neditorials which betray some personal\ndislike for the Union President, but\nhardly anything in the rest of the\npaper. Nothing, certainly, to rival the\nclassic FELICes of Steve Marshall\n(1980-81) or even those of Pallab\nGhosh (1983-84) at his most vitriolic.\nNow Ian Howgate is an interesting\ncharacter. I first met him in early\nOctober 1983, when his chief\ninterests were playing Dungeons &\nDragons and trying to get laid. He\nrose from obscurity in the year before\nhis election as President when leading\nthe crusade for better security in\nCollege residences. In this, and\nindeed in much of his work as Union\nPresident, he has worked very\nconscientiously and with the best\ninterests of IC students uppermost in\nhis mind. He has certainly been one\nof the most committed of Presidents\nin recent years, and if Judith has been\nunfair to him, then I think it has been\nin not drawing attention to his\ndill i gence whilst mocking his\neccentricities.\nBut I'm afraid she has her reasons.\nThere aren't many Council members\nwho were also Union officers last\nyear, but those who were will have\ndifficulty forgetting Howgate's continual interruptions. Whatever the\nsubject, he would hold forth as long\nas his lungs would hold out. Now it's probably expecting too much of\nanyone who seeks public office to be\nshy and retiring, but there's another\nside to this: if you put yourself in the\npublic eye, you have to be prepared\nto take the flack, and this is where\nHowgate falls down. He stormed out\nof Council on more than one occasion\nlast year and he withdrew from the\nPresidential election first time round\njust because a few people made it\nclear they did not want him in the job.\nIt was Ian Howgate that stormed into\nthe FELIX office during the elections\nand demanded that Judith (then VP of\nRCSU) immediately round up a group\nof RCS students who had chosen to\nsteal his posters. It was Ian Howgate\nthat made known his view that the\nUnion President should have the right\nto censor FELIX. It was Ian Howgate\nthat tried to amend the sabbatical job\ndescriptions so that all the posts were\nsubservient to the President. ('But\nwhy, Ian?'\u2014'Because I'm the\nPresident.' Well, bugger me). It's not\nsurprising that he doesn't hit it off\nwith the FELIX Editor.\nBut in one way or another Ian\nHowgate has left his mark on the\nUnion this year. What I find more\nworrying is that his term of office is\nhaving a knock-on effect on FELIX\nas well. He's a hard worker, he's thin\nskinned, and his other great\ncharacteristic is an endless capacity\nfor self-deception. This is what is\nrubbing off on those people who like\nto take his point of view. FELIX may\nnot like Ian Howgate, but Ian decided\nlong ago that he did not like FELIX.\nIf the Ian Howgate hate campaign\nexists it exists chiefly in the mind of\nIan Howgate, and in the mind of\nanyone else he can seduce. FELIX\nalways gets a good shelling but this\nyear it seems to have escalated into\na bombardment fed by paranoia. This\nis a shame, because you only have to\nlook at yesterday's proceedings to\nknow that, without its newspaper, IC\nUnion is a festering heap of\nego maniacs. On top of his other\nqualities, Ian has a gift for putting\nacross flawed opinions and being\nbelieved. This is not a situation\nwithout precedent, but only\nPresidents such as Carl Burgess have\ndared to suggest that they should\ncontrol FELIX. From Beit Arch to the\ncentral staircase, an iron curtain has\nfallen across IC Union.\nEditor-in-chief Judith Hackney\nGuest Editorial by David Jones\nBusiness Manager Chris Martin\nReviews Editors Andrew Clarke\nand Sumit Guha\nClubs Editor Andrew Waller\nSports Editors Dominic Strowbridge\nand 'Hector' Sullivan\nScience Editor...

    "content": "lew s JILHi\nIronweed\nIt is rare these days to see a truly bad\nfilm. Films cost too much money for\nanyone to risk making a bad one but\nHector Babenco has managed, against\nall odds, to achieve just that. His film\nIronweed runs for two hours fifteen\nminutes and seems to last twice as\nlong.\nThe film is set in 1938 in the\ndepressed town of Albany NY where\nFrancis Phelan (Jack Nicholson) and\nhis down-and-out friends scrape out\nan existence in soup kitchens and\nflophouses, doing odd jobs and\ndrinking liquor. When working as a grave digger he visits for the first time\nthe grave of his son, who died at 13\ndays when Nicholson accidentally\ndropped him on the floor twenty two\nyears previously. The grave starts him\nthinking about his life before the\naccident and about the wife and family\nhe left because he couldn't face the\nguilt. From then on the film\nchronicles the events of the next day\nand half with numerous scenes of life\nas a hobo and his belated return home\nbearing a151b turkey as a gift.\nThe scene of reconciliation is\nactually quite moving but it comes too\nlate in the film (about two hours too\nlate). By that time you are too bored\nto care, having sat through what must\nbe the most lengthy exposition in\ncinema history. Babenco seems so\nanxious to show what life was like as\na tramp that he uses most of the\nrunning time just to set the scene. The\nboredom and hopelessness of their\nlives is conveyed by boring the pants\noff the audience.\nThe film is based on William\nKennedy's Pulitzer Prize winning\nnovel of the same name (by the way;\nwhat does Ironweed mean?). But the\ndepth of character is ation possible in\na novel is not easily transferred to the\nscreen. After half an hour the\ncharacters are established and you\nwonder when the plot will arrive. An\nhour later you are still wondering, the\nintervening time seeming very empty\nbecause the director fails to express\nthe ideas of the book in film ic terms.\nBesides two superstars (Nicholson\nand Meryl Streep) the cast boasts Fred\nGwynne (Herman Munster), Tom\nWaits and 60s sex symbol Carrol\nBaker who is no baby doll any more.\nShe's no actress any more either\nalthough some of the acting is very\ngood, managing to produce the\nobligatory oscar nomination for Ms\nStreep. Unfortunately no amount of\ngood acting could rescue this film\nfrom the hands of its director.\nIronweed is sad proof of the fact that\neven Hollywood's finest can come up\nwith a151b turkey every now and\nagain.\nSteve Roberts.\nJtUSILU\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\nIron Maiden\nI 've always bought Iron Maiden\nalbums because they use Heavy Metal\nas a medium for presenting interesting\nmusical and lyrical ideas, rather than\nsimply thrashing out rock clich es to\nshouted 'blood and guts' lyrics.\nUnfortunately, the latter is a far more\naccurate description of their new LP,\n7th Son of a7 th Son. Even Derek\nRiggs' usually stunning cover\nillustrations are lacking, although the\ninner-sleeve is terrific. As with their\nlast album, synths can now be heard\nunobtrusively in the mix, along with\nsampled choirs on the very long title-track, the second half of which\ncontains most of the novelty on the\nalbum. The chorus, however, simply\nconsists of the title repeated 8 times!\nThe acoustic guitar ending to The\nProphecy would have come as a surprise to people if I hadn't spoilt it.\nA pity really, as there aren't any other\nsurprises.\nRichard Fincher\nThe Innocents\nErasure\nGiven that Erasure's latest album, The\nInnocents, is produced by Stephen\nHague, you might expect it to sound\nlike the 'every-hit's the-same'\nPetshop Boys. That sound is certainly\nin evidence, but Vince Clarke's catchy formula music is still the\npredominant feature. Vince is good\nat what he does, and obviously sees\nno reason to vary things unduly.\nAnyone who liked The Circus will go\nfor this one too. Unlike some gay\nlyricists, Andy Bell has always\nwritten lines which can be identified\nwith by both gay and straight people,\nalthough he does slip up in Witch in\na Ditch, albeit in German, which has\na catchy folk music tune. The other\nnon-formula track is 65000, which is\na boring attempt at a house\ninstrumental, the packaging is very\nattractive, the music, consistently\nchart-orientated, with numerous\npotential singles.\nRichard Fincher\nBlind\nThe Icicle Works\nFollowing last year's If You Want to\nDefeat Your Enemy, Sing His Song,\ncomes Blind. Consistently creative,\nyet consistently denied of commercial\nsuccess. The Icicle Works continue\nto cut their way through the ever\nincreasing volume of dross that finds\nits way onto radio playlists and shops,\nin their gritty s couse way. Blind is a blend of styles as diverse as the\nAfrican sounding What Do You Want\nMe To Do? through to the Prince\nsound-a like Kiss Off. McNabb still\nreminds us though that he's still\nlistening to his Led Zeppelin and Neil\nYoung albums, Shit Ceek sounding\nparticularly like Jimmy Page...\nThe title track though is without\ndoubt the finest track on the album.\nFollowing on from Up Here in the\nNorth a single from ...Enemy...,\nMcNabb sets about telling you in\nunder five minutes what's wrong with\nBritain/the World in 1988. No doubt,\nthis record will slip by barely noticed,\nwithout the recognition and radio play\nit deserves. Support a worthy cause,\nthe boys are probably still mourning\ntheir team's failed attempt at the FA\nCup (no doubt to be featured on the\nnext album).\nBrad Blundell.\nThe Wonderstuff\nMarquee, 5th March\nAs usual, The Wonderstuff mix a set\nof loud indie/rock with humour and\nwit, with the lead singer 'Miles' (!!)\nsupplying the inter song chatter. What\nThe Wonderstuff are good at are fast,\nshort pop songs such as their current\nsingle Give, Give, Give Me More,\nMore, More that are perfect to jump\nabout to. They will definitely be\nheading for bigger and better things\nif the following of fans they have and\nthe media attention they have been\nreceiving are anything to-go by.\nMac\nFELIX Friday May 20th198811 "

Inspired\nwords from a man who knows\nhow to kill ants.\nAn open letter to the Union President\nSyd's circus\nDear Mr Howgate,\nI am writing with reference to the orchestrated circus\nthat occurred last Monday night ie ICU Council.\nSpecifically I refer to four items of business.\nItem one: you steadfastly refused to discuss Mr Alan\nRose's conduct with regard to Union Bar/Snack Bar losses.\nThe reason given was that a police investigation was\npending. However Mr Chas Jackson stated from the floor\nthat Mr Rose was only guilty of 'gross mismanagement'\nand that there was no hint of criminal activity on his part.\nThe obvious assumption from this is that you deliberately\nset out to deceive Council.\nItem two: you reintroduced Constitution and Policy\nOfficer via 'the back door' in the form of amended job\ndescriptions for UGM and Council chairs. This is despite\na decision by a previous UGM to throw out this new job.\nAs I was elected U GM chair before this new job\ndescription went through I am now expected to carry out\na job for which I did not stand. The reasoning behind this\nis presumably to force my resignation so that either\nyourself or your sidekick Mr Neil McCluskey can stand\nas CPO, a job you are sure to reintroduce. Tough luck,\nI'm staying.\nItem three: Along with Mr Nigel Baker, you helped to\nensure that Mr Dave Tyler did not receive social colours\nfor his contribution to Rag this year. Anyone who raises\na four-figure sum for Rag, helps to organise Rag events\nand goes out collecting from theatres at times when he\nprobably had better things to do, surely deserves some\nrecognition from Imperial College Union. Am I right in\nassuming that personal opinions have influenced your\ndecision?\nItem four: You successfully moved that all Pub Board\ncolours be referred back for reconsideration. The reason\nfor this is apparent to anyone with half a brain in their\nhead, you objected to certain members of FELIX staff\nreceiving an award specifically because they have been\ncritical of your action this year\u2014notably in the past four\nweeks. This was not the reason given Monday night.\nIn conclusion. Mr Howgate, you deceived Council in\nmuch the same way as you have deceived the members\nof Imperial College Union all year. I await your reply to\nthis letter. You surely deem a reply is necessary, as no\nresponse is an endorsement of the above points.\nYours cynically,\nPaul Shanley.\nObjective report?\nDear Judith,\nI question strongly your view of the 'truth'. How can\nanybody purporting to have one iota of journalistic ability,\nproduce a flysheet, based on an hour and a half long\ninterview, and still misrepresent the facts at the time with\na report dotted with tiny quotes? You reported that Mr\nHarbour-Bridge 'said that he could have sacked the staff\nwho were suspected of petty pilfering but if he had got\nthe wrong people it \"would have been far worse\" than\nsacking everybody.' The only quote you used in this\nparagraph made no mention of the word 'sacking'. The\nSnack Bar staff have been 'laid off, since the outlet has\nbeen closed. Technically, you can't 'sack' casual staff\nsince they have no contract of employment; do you still\nsay your reporting was factual?\nWhat fun can be had from quoting out of context. Here's Letter\nhow your editorial sounds, when reported FELIX style;\nT always believed that growing up, maturing, call it\nwhat you will, was something you did by your own\nexperience...I feel I 've missed something.'\nIs this a true record of your editorial? I leave it to your\nreaders to judge for themselves.\nTo set the record straight, I still feel my reporting was\nfactual. I quoted from the minutes of the catering\ncommittee and the letter sent to Mr Rose last Friday. At\nno point did I quote Mr Harbour-Bridge, since I felt he\nwas too emotionally involved to give an objective report\non the events at the time. Mr Rose did not appear in the\nUnion Office all day and was not available on the\ntelephone; how could I have asked him for comment? I spoke to one of the Bar Staff to find the main areas of\ncomplaint they had and then tried to find out more about\nwhat had gone on. Most of the facts were, and still are,\nunavailable and I can understand why. If you were\nconsidering the dismissal of one of your permanent\nmembers of staff, wouldn't you feel it only fair that they\nwere given the full list of reasons at their hearing before\nthey were distributed to all and sundry?\nAs for your complaint that I was reporting on ICU\naffairs, why shouldn'tI? It seems that you are incapable\nof doing so properly.\nI shall certainly be at the AGM to question our Union\nOfficers.

By mid-1948 he\nhad proved that his theory could work\nin practise.\nAt the end of 1948, Gabor moved\nto Imperial College in London where\nhe had been appointed Reader in\nElectron Physics. In 1956 he wrote\nthat the preceding 6-7 years had been\nthe happiest of his scientific career.\nProfessor Eric Ash, Rector of\nImperial College, was the first student\nGabor supervised for a PhD. He\nwrote of Gabor:\nThere was no doubt amongst his\nstudents that Gabor should win the\nNobel Prize for something - we\ndebated just what it might be. Nor was\nthis a symptom of hero worship of\nwhich we were largely innocent. We\ncould assess the magnitude of the\nintellect but found it harder to discern\nthe direction.\nThis is, perhaps, hardly surprising.\nIn this period he designed an\ninterference microscope, started\nexperimental work in plasma\noscillations and did pioneering work\nin communication theory.\nThroughout his life, Gabor was\ninsistent that he was an engineer and\ninventor, rather than a scientist.\nPerhaps is surprising, then, that he did\nnot always like to work with\nengineers:\nMy experience with engineering\nstudents is that one in two is\ncompletely unfit for research, and the\nother takes a year before he gets\ngoing. For this reason I am taking on\na young physicist; their starting time\nis less, but of course there is always\nthe possibility of getting a dud.\nWhen doing experimental work, he\ntended to design an experiment and\nthen let the research assistants and\nstudents get on with it. This left him\nfree to go into his office to write.\nCommunication between Gabor\nand the students was sometimes\ndifficult. He often found it difficult\nto get down to the level of the students\nwhen trying to explain some idea.\nEric Ash wrote:\nHis lecture courses... seemed\nmemorable but hardly capable of\nassimilation - at least, until the\nrealization dawned that they were not\nso much lectures but master classes.\nIt was necessary to 'know' the subject\nbefore attending these occasions; but\nthen the experience was enormously\nworthwhile - providing both the long\nhistorical view as well as insight in\ndepth and generality.\nIn 1956 Gabor went back to\nGermany for a visit. Of his trip he\nwrote:\nThis was my first visit to Germany\nsince 1933, and it was almost a triumphal entry. I was the guest of\nGottingen University and of the Max\nPlanck Institute, to whom I gave a lecture on information theory and\nphysics. They gave a dinner in my\nhonour where I sat between Otto\nHahn and Heisenberg, who treated\nnever taken up since the cathode ray\ntube had been shortened by this time.\nIn 1956, however, the Sunday Times\nfound out about the research and\nprinted an article on the subject.\nGabor was concerned for his\nreputation and wrote to Allibone, who\nwas now head of the Associated\nElectrical Industries (AEI) research\nlabs at Aldermaston:\nYou may have seen in yesterday's me with more than polite courtesy.\nThese good Germans, whom nobody\ncould ever accuse of nazism, are\npathetically keen on making amends\nfor the others.\nBetween 1952 and 1958, Gabor\nworked on another of his pet projects,\nthe thin TV tube which could be used\nfor both monochrome and colour. The\nexperimental work was, in fact,\nsuccessful, but his invention was\nSunday Times a short article 'New TV\nset will hang on wall', mentioning\nthat I am developing such a tube. I want you to know that I neither\ninspired this article nor authorised it.\nPresumably it has been released by\nthe National Research Development\nCorporation, perhaps in the hope that\nthe British valve manufacturers would\nprick up their ears. For my part I am\nrather concerned about the article, as\nit could be read as self-advertisement,\nwhich can only be harmful to me. I wanted to let you know, in case you\nhave an opportunity to rectify false\nimpressions.\nDennis was appointed to a personal\nChair of Applied Electron Physics at\nImperial College in 1958. His\ninaugural lecture entitled Electronic\nInventions and their Impact on\nCivilization eventually became the\nbook Inventing the Future.\nIn 1958 he started working on a project involving thermo-nuclear\nfusion, but illness intervened in 1961\nwhen thrombosis-phlebitis of the legs\nsent him to hospital which forced him\nto withdraw from the project.\nIn 1962 the AEI research facility at\nAldermaston closed down. To a journalist from the Financial Times\nhe wrote:\nIn fact your personal worries are\nnow part of a very sinister\ndevelopment. Do you know that ICI\nare closing down their fundamental\nresearch at Welwyn, and Courtaulds\nare also shutting down fundamental\nresearch? I am afraid what is\nhappening is nothing less than the end\nof what can really be called research\nin industry in this country. It is a catastrophic development. When I came to this country 29 years ago and\nnoticed the primitive state of\nindustrial research as compared with\nthat in Germany, I thought, as most\npeople did, that it would be different\nin a generation, when the people who\nhad themselves done research when\nthey were young would have risen to\nhigh management posts. Just the\nopposite has happened, it is not the\nresearch man who has replaced the\nbluff old production engineer, but the\naccountant.\nFrom 1963, when Leith and\nUpatnieks applied lasers to\nholography, Gabor's place in history\nwas secured. When in 1971 he won\nthe Nobel Prize, Upatnieks sent the\nfirst telegram congratulating him, and\nin 1972 Leith wrote as part of the\nintroduction to the Nobel Lecture\nprinted in the proceedings of the\nIEEE:\nWhile Nobel awards are given for\nspecific achievements, it nonetheless\nseems fitting that the recipients of\nscience's highest award should be\ntruly intellectual giants in the\nbroadest sense. On all scores, Dennis\nGabor is worthy of this award.\nFELIX acknowledges the assistance\ngiven by the College Archives and\nHolographies International.\nFELIX Friday May 20th19889 "

    "content": "Eating Rocks\nPrecious metals, such as Gold or\nPlatinum, are so expensive that they\nare worth extracting from rocks that\ncontain only tiny amounts of them: 5\ngrams of Gold per tonne of extracted\nrock is not uncommon. Sometimes\nthis tiny amount of precious material\nis easy to extract: metallic gold is\nheavier than most rocks so\nsophisticated large-scale versions of\npanning can be used to separate it (in\na fast-flowing stream of water the\nleast dense bits get washed away\nbefore the heavier bits). However, in\nsome precious-metal ores the valuable\nbits are much more difficult to\nextract. About 30% of all Gold is\nfound in rocks made from sulphide\nminerals and these tend to hold on to\nabout one third of their Gold content\n(even when harsh chemical methods\nare used to try to get it out). A Canadian mining company has\nrecently proposed a new method that\npromises to get almost all the Gold\nfrom sulphide rocks. The method\ninvolves eating the rock.\nWhile eating rock (even the sort\nyou get with 'Welcome to Blackpool'\nwritten the whole way through it) is\nnot good for people, there are some\nbugs that just love it. One particular\nbacterium, Thiobacillus Ferridoxans,\ngets its energy by 'burning' the\nsulphide ores into sulphates (sulphates\nare derived from sulphides by adding\noxygen\u2014thereby releasing lots of\nenergy). This makes the rock more\nsoluble and breaks down its\nimpermeable and dense structure,\nmaking it much easier to extract the\nprecious components.\nThe only problem involved results\nfrom the am out of heat produced\nduring the digestion: the bacteria have\nto be kept at 30 \u00b0 C but this requires\na large amount of cooling and a large\nvat to hold the soup while the bugs\ndo their work. The extra Gold\nrecovered makes it worthwhile.\nMeanwhile, British biotech-no logi sts are working on some other\nbugs that work at much higher\ntemperatures and would therefore\nrequire smaller vats and less cooling.\nThese might be useful in\ncircumstances where the expense of\nthe Canadian bugs would not be\njustified. Perhaps this unusual\napplication of designer-bugs to\ngeology is a sign that biotechnology\nis, at last, starting to do something\nuseful with all the money that has\ngone into it.\nUNDER THE MICROSiSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nSpaghetti Universe\nAstronomy's latest fad is the cosmic\nstring. As is typical for such fads,\ncosmic strings are being used to\nexplain every piece of anomalous\ninformation available to astronomers.\nIn particular, they have recently been\ninvoked to explain why the observed\nuniverse is lumpy.\nFirst let's look at the observed\nfacts. In the last few years\nastronomers have concluded that there\nare huge holes in space between\nclusters of galaxies. This was\nunexpected and is, apparently,\ndifficult to explain given conventional\nassumptions about the origin of the\nuniverse and the formation of\ngalaxies. More recently a group of\nastronomers known as the seven\nsamurai have uncovered some other\nrelated awkward facts about the\nmotion of some nearby galaxies.\nTheir observations show that our\nneighbouring galaxies are being\npulled by some mysterious object\ncalled the Great Attractor (which is\nabout 200 million light years away in\nthe direction of the southern cross,\nturn left at Betelgeuse). This attraction\nwas discovered by subtracting the\nexpected velocities (resulting from the\nattraction due to the known galactic\nlumps) from the actual velocities\n(measured by red shifts). However,\nthe quality of this sort of data is\nquestionable (and often questioned)\nsince it relies on incomplete galactic\nsurveys.\nAstro-theorists are never slow to\njump on the bandwagon, even if it is\nbased only on dud observations. So\ncosmic strings have been invoked to\nexplain some of the anomalous facts.\nStrings already existed in the minds\nof the Alice-in-Wonderland theorists\nwho like to publish six impossible\nthings before breakfast, but until these\nrecent observations they had no facts\nthat could be usefully explained by\nthem.\nWhat the strings are is difficult to\ncomprehend (though I welcome any\nattempts by physicists to explain them\nmore thoroughly on these pages).\nBasically, they can be thought of as\none-dimensional defects in the fabric\nof space. Space near a string is\ndistorted in such a way that if you\ntravelled in a circular path around\none, you would not have travelled a full 360\u00b0. Such odd objects in various\nincarnations (including massive\nstrings which weigh a lot,\nsuperconducting strings and loops of\nstring) have been invoked to explain\nanomalies such as the great attractor\nand the in homogeneous nature of the\nuniverse. They are now even being\nused to explain the origins of galaxies\nthemselves.\nCosmic strings were, according to\nthe people who champion their\nexistence, formed in the very early\nstages of the Big Bang and have\npermeated the universe in a sort of\ncosmic Spaghetti ever since. As\nclouds of dust and gas flowed past\nthem in the chaos of the early universe\nthe clouds were condensed into thin\nsheets (this is a result of the distortion\nof space around the string). These\nsheets were condensed enough to\nform into galaxies and clusters of\ngalaxies whose distribution will\ntherefore be very uneven. One\ninteresting (and testable) prediction\nfrom this model is that the distribution\nof galaxies is more like a sponge than\na foam (a foam has lots of completely\nenclosed bubbles but a sponge has\nonly one interconnecting but very\ncomplicated hole surrounding a single\npiece of matter).\nIt will be worth waiting for the\nobservations to sort these ideas out,\nbut it will be even more fun to see\nwhat the theoreticians can dream up\nnext: a cosmic reef-knot perhaps?\nEditorial:\nScience and\nthe Heretic\nIn most fields of human endeavour the\nheretic is an unwelcome distraction.\nNot so in science: there, the heretic\nis an absolute necessity. Not that you\nwould know that by looking at the\nway they are treated by the\nestablishment. For example, when\nRupert Sheldrake's heretical work A New Science Of Life first appeared,\nthe editor of Nature suggested that it\nshould be burnt in public. It may well\nbe that the book was full of nonsense,\nbut Sheldrake stuck to the rules of\nscience and suggested how his ideas\ncould be tested.\nIn responding to his challenge,\nmany biologists will have been forced\nto think afresh about the fundamentals\nof their subject. This will have kept\nthem intellectually alert. The more\nyou close your mind to new ideas, the\nmore stodgy your own ideas become.\nStrict adherence to the conventional\nis a sure path towards intellectual\nstagnation.\nRecently New Scientist opened its\npages to another biological heretic:\nPeter Duesberg, who believes that\nHIV is not the cause of AIDS. He\nbelieves that the virus is benign and\nthat AIDS is simply a product of a sexually degenerate lifestyle.\nDuesberg's ideas were ignored by the\nestablishment when he first published\nthem, but this only encouraged him\nand his supporters in the press.\nNew Scientist took a more\nreasonable approach: they allowed\nDuesberg two pages to put forward\nhis ideas and then gave someone else\nthe same amount of space to refute\nthem. Duesberg's opponent admitted\nthat he had to think again about the\nbasic evidence when confronted with\nthe heresy, but the rethink only\nreinforced his own beliefs. He won\nthe argument convincingly.\nThis is the way all scientific debate\nshould be conducted. Heretics are a valuable spur to new thought and if\ntheir ideas are wrong then open public\ndebate is a better way to prove them\nwrong than suppression. Anyway,\nsometimes the heretics are right and\nconventional science just holds back\nprogress by ignoring them.\n6 Friday May 20th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Quite\npossibly. But certain figures have\nbeen passed in my direction.\nHamlet Gardens is a head tenancy\ndown in Hammersmith. Students are\ncharged either \u00a333 or \u00a336 per week\ndepending on which block they are\nliving in. This figure is zero-rated for\nVAT during term because it is a student residence. It does not include\ngas or electricity.\nHowever, during the Summer\nLetting Scheme, the same flats are let\nout at \u00a334pw for the first four weeks\nand then \u00a328pw after that. This\nincludes VAT at 15 % for the first four\nweeks and 3% after that. My\ncalculator reckons that the zero-rated\nVAT is therefore about \u00a327pw. This\nfigure is inclusive of gas and\nelectricity bills. At an average of\n\u00a34.50pw for gas and electricity this\nmeans that College is getting about\n\u00a322.50pw during the summer.\nIt doesn't take a degree in\nMathematics to see that \u00a3 2 2 . 5 0 is\nconsiderably less than the average\n\u00a3 3 4 . 5 0 that students are being\ncharged.\nWhy are students sub sidi sing summer residents?\n\u2022 COMRADE HOWGATE has\nbeen confiding to close 'friends',\nnotably Mr Martyn Peck, FELIX spy,\nthat he may find himself in academic\ntrouble next year. Hissing Syd is\napparently not guaranteed of a place\nin College next year. Will this\nendanger his master plan to get\nelected as Union President for the\nsecond time, at the end of next year?\n\u2022 THERE WERE some very weird\nproxies flying about at Council on\nMonday night. It seemed that people\nwere running about College all day,\ndesperately making phone calls in a bid to have a vote. One member\npresent, however, went out of his way\nto ensure he was there.

In their infinite wisdom, they\nhave chosen the ASSA 6000 series. This was the one installed in\nLinstead Hall over the summer. Why has the Union again chosen an\nASSA system when:\n\u2022 Dozens of masters (ie R37s, ES1s, etc) are flying about?\n\u2022 The Linstead 'foolproof system was cracked within eight hours\nof installation?\nTalking of key systems, why has Southwell warden Ken Young been\nexpressing an interest in obtaining a particular key? He asked one of\nmy spies if he could gain entry to Sherfield Level Four Finance. Why?\n\u2022 How many keys has College Chief Security Office Geoff Reeves\nreceived since he declared an amnesty on illegal key-holders?\n\u2022 Following my question a few weeks back, I can now reveal that\nUnion Administrator Jen Hardy-Smith was responsible for the Union\nreorganisation. She even drew up the 'white paper' for the scheme.\nIf Mrs Hardy-Smith is pulling the strings in the Union, then presumably\nMr Harbour-Bridge is Pinnochio, the lying puppet who broke free.\n\u2022 Life Sciences had a first-year intake of 140 students at the start\nof this year as opposed to a planned 100. A source of mine within\nthe department has told me that it is intended to raise the pass mark\nin order to fail more students. This would bring the size of the year\ndown to a manageable level. Can the head of department refute this?\n\u2022 Al Birch, Falmouth Keogh Assistant Subwarden informs me that\nThe Players were indeed at Rag Fete and threw a deck of cards off\nthe top of the Queen's Tower. Funny how no one else saw it, eh, Al?\nIs Mr Birch trying to shift attention away from himself? Could it\nbe that The Players weren't at Rag Fete because one of them was\nin Cambridge at the time, ie Mr Birch himself?\n\u2022 RCS tramp Tony Spencer wrote in to deny last week's story\nconcerning his leaking of information to Delator. However as I pointed\nout at the time, Mr Spencer is on Delator's 'unreliable information'\nlist. Consequently I don't believe a word he says.\nOn this subject, a third source within Guilds has refused to deny\nmy allegation that a slush fund exists.\n\u2022 A certain Hall/House Warden applied for the warden ship with 'his\nwife'. Why does his wife and kid(s) have a different surname to him?\nCould it be that they're not really married?\n\u2022 Two items marked 'confidential' were discussed at Monday night's Council.

Why? Close friends tell me\nthat she was disillusioned and cynical\nby the time she left. Her main reason\nwas the lack of support she was\ngetting from both her colleagues and\nImperial College Union.\nThe Student Accommodation\nOffice seems to be in a bit of a turmoil\nat the moment. Student\nAccommodation Officer Loretto\nO 'Callaghan is convinced that the\noffice will not be running smoothly\nuntil next year. The question on many\npeople's lips now is why, at the height\nof exam time and two months after\nMs Simmons left, has her job not\nbeen advertised? And why doesn't Imperial College Union push for the\npost to be filled now?\nSources close to the SAO have\nspeculated that it could be because\nUnion sabbaticals don't need welfare\nadvice\u2014but they do need jobs as\nsub wardens next year!\n\u2022FORMER RCSU HON SEC Tom\nMelliar-Smith was seen wandering\nhapless ly in the direction of the Union\nBuilding last Wednesday night.

IC batted first, and\ndespite an unpleasantly sticky wicket,\nmanaged to put on 80 runs before\nlunch. After the break Adrian Lewis\nterror is ed the UC bowling with an\ninspired 48, but the loss of his wicket\nheralded a tail end collapse and we\nwere all out for 142.\nMr Lewis's batting exertions had\nleft him too shattered to bowl, and cut\nIC's attack to three bowlers.\nFortunately, we had the men for the\njob in the agile O 'Brien and stubborn\nconsistency of Tim Harmer and Andy\nMcGee.

In a six boat final,\nusing the infamous wall of water\ntechnique and rating a phenomenal\n147 off the start, the Imperial four\nfound themselves half a length up on\na world championship silver medal\nwinning crew in the adjacent lane.\n(This crew only drew level with a mere 100m of the race left!) However\nthe important race was against\nDurham who were beaten by 2Vi lengths\u2014reversing the previous day's margin.\nOther wins were achieved in the\n'special race for extremely slow\ndouble sculls' and 'almost' lightning\ncox less fours. In the latter, yet\nanother crew combination was tried\n(with Porky Roper rowing at 2) and\nthe four cruised home to win easily.\nThe most exciting win of the\nweekend, however, was in the Senior\n1 fours. Suffering from a weakened\nsquad after a number of oarsmen were\noff games (without notes) the crew\nwas formed on the day, forcing ICs\ncoach, Mad-Dog Mason out of\nretirement and into the technical seat\nof the boat. In a race that was a cliff\nhanger throughout its 6:47\" duration,\nIC won by 4 feet. Bill Mason is 38.\nSQUASH Unsquashable\nFour IC squash players have proved\nto be 'un squash able' and are now\nteam champions of London's Fourth\nDivision.\nThe fifth team of IC snapped the\nChampionship from the London\nSchool of Economics virtually on the\n'finishing line'. The LSE had started\nthis squash season as the mighty\nfavourite but surprisingly dropped\npoints against teams from the midfield\nof the league table, which then\nsuffered 'whitewash' defeats against\nImperial College.\nFour convincing 5-0 victories in\ntheir last four games finally left\nLenssen, Bashir, Midler and Patel\ntwo points clear of the disappointed\nLSE team.

The project is\nto investigate how to organise\ncollection of paper from all over\nCollege and will run for eight weeks\nover the summer vacation. The\nproject will be funded by UK2000,\nthe project headed by Richard\nBranson, and supported by Friends of\nthe Earth, to provide cash for\ncommunity efforts to improve the\nenvironment. IC Union have also\noffered to provide some funding and\noffice space.\nThere are a number of problems\nassociated with collecting paper for\nrecycling which will need to be\ninvestigated in this project. One of the\nmost obvious, which has dogged\nprevious attempts is where to store the\npaper, and how the fire risk can be\novercome. It is hoped that a deal can\nbe negotiated with a waste paper\ndealer to provide fire-proofing as\nnecessary. Other problems include\nhow best to sort the paper as certain\ngrades of paper are worth more than\nothers, and how to encourage people\nto collect their waste paper.\nThe results of the project will be\npresented in a written report which\ncan then be circulated to other\ncolleges and institutions to encourage\nthem to set up their own paper\nrecycling schemes.\nAnyone interested in earning some\nmoney over the summer while\nremaining ideologically sound should\ncontact either Dr Richard Murphy\n(Dept of Pure & Applied Biology) or\nSteve Easterbrook (Dept of\nComputing).\nCity &\nGuilds News\nCity & Guilds Union have awarded\nthe following colours:\nFull Colours\nDave Tyler (Union), Tanya Maule\n(Union, President), Alan Hepper\n(Union, President), Rebecca Hunt\n(Union.

The project of the grim\nreaper has scared many a first year\ninto frantic work,-and reminded the\nsecond years of lost time. Talk is full\nof hints dropped by the teaching staff\nin tutorials and lectures.\nThis is the time the 'spotter kings'\n(or queens) make a mark. Carefully\npicking their way through the\nminefield of summer exams, they\nexamine each topic for the probability\nof appearing in the paper. Success can\nbe stunning, for example last year in\none paper (and I stress only one\npaper) an individual spotted 20 out of\n21 questions. Unfortunately such a dazzling performance occurs only\nonce.\nProbably the funniest sight of the\nday is the race to the library after the\nfirst lecture! Unless you are at the\nfront your chances of a desk are\nlimited. As one walks into the library\nthe atmosphere of concentration is\nimmediately apparent.

This is partly to improve\ntheir style and accuracy, but is also\n(and probably more importantly) to\nsee if the tutor will drop any half-hint\nthat can be acted upon. Such rumours\nspread around with the speed of a well\nfanned bush fire, so that by the end\nof this week almost every subject\nindividual will have been spotted!\nMounds and mounds of paper have\nbeen destroyed and countless pens\ndiscarded. One individual used a whole pad (200 sheets) of A4 in a week (using both sides and no waste).\nThis feat gains even more credibility\nwhen one remembers that there are\nfew if any formulae or calculations\nrequired, as most of the work is in\nessay form.\nThe ironic thing is that most of this\nwork is of no practical use for the\nfuture, simply a way to pass the 1st or 2nd MB. To work so hard and\namass so much information\u2014each\nsubject doubles the vocabulary, just\nto pass a single set of exams and then\nforget most of it strikes me as one of\nthe biggest wastes of time ever\ndevised. Those poeple who do well\nin 2nd MB do not necessarily make\ngood doctors, so what is the benefit\nof it all?\n4 Friday May 20th1988 FELIX\n\n"

The Union Executive gave a limited\nexplanation of the crisis, but were not able to disclose full details.\nThe meeting was opened to an\naudience of around 200 students at\n1.05pm yesterday in the Union\nConcert Hall. It was decided that\nawards should be handed out to their\nvarious recipients before the rest of\nthe business was dealt with.\nThe first awards to be made were\nICU Social Colours to members of\nCollege staff. Prof D Ewing and\nVernon McClure received their\nawards for their work on academic\naffairs; Patrick the Beit Quadrangle\nMessenger for his work as a messenger; Adrian Johnson for his\nwork as Union Bar Manager; Reggie\nBlennerhassett for his work as Union\nAccountant; and Sashi Patel for his\nwork in the Wages Office.\nAfter this. Imperial College Union\nPresident Sydney Harbour-Bridge\nannounced that a new ICU award was\nto be given by the ICU Executive for\noutstanding service to the Union in\nany one year. John Noble and Ian\nMorris were awarded an ICU\nOutstanding Service Award for their\nwork on Entertainments; Nigel Baker\nfor his work on Rag; Chas Brereton\nfor his work on Academic Affairs;\nMark Harris for his general help\naround the Union Office; Rob Kelly\nfor his work last year; Dr Ken Weale\nfor his work as ICU Honorary Senior\nTreasurer; Chris Martin for his work\non Publications Board and transport;\nand Kevin O 'Connor for his work on\naccommodation.\nThe final awards to be made at the\nmeeting were the Union General\nAwards (UGA), given by the Union\nPresident for service to the Union\nover a sustained period. The first\nUGA was awarded to Chas Jackson,\nthis year's ICU Honorary Secretary,\nfor his work as last year's ICU\nPublicity Officer and Hon Sec.\nQuentin Fontana was also given a UGA for his work as ICU Honorary\nSecretary two years ago. Mr Fontana\nis no longer a student at Imperial and\nwas not awarded aUG A by Carl\nBurgess, the ICU President two years\nago. Mr Harbour-Bridge said that he\nwished to make this retrospective\naward because he believed that Mr\nFontana had 'held the student union\ntogether at that time'.\nMr Chas Brereton was awarded the\nthird UGA for his work on Academic\nAffairs this year and in view of the\nlarge sums of money he has raised in\nthe past three years for Rag.\nMr David Clements was awarded\nhis UGA for his work with Debating\nSociety, Science Fiction Society, the\nRoyal College of Science Union and\nwork as ICU Social Clubs Committee\nChairman this year.\nThe penultimate UGA went to\nCollege Secretary Mr John Smith for\nthe support that he has given Imperial\nCollege Union over the time he has\nbeen at IC and for the amount of\nmoney he has made available to the\nUnion this year.\nThe final UGA was awarded to\nUnion Administrator Mrs Jen Hardy\nSmith who Mr Harbour-Bridge\ndescribed as the 'most deserving\ncase'. He said that he believed it was\ntime to make this award to Mrs Hardy\nSmith after the many years service she\nhad put into the Union.\nFollowing the award ceremony, a procedural motion was passed which\nbrought the emergency motions to the\ntop of the agenda. The first\nemergency motion, proposed by\nChris Martin and opposed by the ICU\nPresident, concerned the position of\n,the Deputy President, Mr Alan Rose,\nwho has been relieved of his\nmanagement responsibility for the\ntrading outlets. The motion called on\nthe Executive to explain why they\ntook the action regarding Mr Rose\nand to present any evidence they had\nregarding his all edged 'gross\nmisconduct'. It also called for an open\ndebate on the matter. After speeches\nfrom both sides, the motion was\npassed.\nAt the end of several minutes\ndiscussion of whether the action\nshould be debated, Mr HarbourBridge agreed to answer questions\nfrom the floor.\nWhen Mr Martin asked why the\nDeputy President had been relieved\nof his responsibilities, the meeting\nwas again interrupted by several\nprocedural motions from the floor and\nheated discussion on the conduct of\nall four sabbaticals.\nMr Harbour-Bridge was asked to\ngive exact figures for the lost revenue\nfrom the Union Snack Bar. He said\nthat projected profits of \u00a3 3 5 , 0 0 0\n(calculated by assuming that the stock\nthat had been purchased had been\nsold) had 'disappeared', and that the\nSnack Bar had actually made a trading\nloss of \u00a310,000 during this academic\nyear. He added that last year's trading\ndeficit had been \u00a33,000.\nMr Rose stated that he believed that\ndecisions made by the Executive two\nweeks ago had been based on opinions\nand not facts. Again the floor asked\nfor clarification of the accusation of\n'gross mismanagement' which had\nbeen levelled against Mr Rose by the\nExecutive. Not much was\nforthcoming.\ncontinued on back page\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

The\nwind section had a very tricky task\nin the Bizet but had a great\nopportunity to put their talents on\nshow. There are some fast and testing\npassages in 'Carmen' but these posed\nno problem proving the ability of the\nwind section.\nWe are very lucky in having so\nmany talented players in ICSO and\nRobert Manasse is certainly one of\nthem. He played the Reinicke with\nfeeling and apparent ease.\nThe Peterloo Overture was\ncommissioned in 1968 to\ncommemorate the 100th anniversary\nof the TUC. It regales the events of\nthe Peterloo massacre in 1819 in\nwhich 11 people were killed by\ncavalry. It was a piece of great\ncontrast and was my favourite piece\nin the programme, a feeling shared by\nmany others.\nThe Grand Finale was the suite\nfrom the motion picture Star Wars big tunes, that are well known and\nreminiscent of Mars from the Planets,\ntender tunes represent Princess Leia.\nThe only possible criticism of this\nmay be that the French Horn player\nexperienced some difficulty in\novercoming nerves whilst playing her\nsolo. This was a pity as in the\nrehearsals she'd played faultlessly.\nThe thing I admired was that she\ncontinued to complete the solo which\nisn't easy if you know of a slight\nerror.\nThe finale was a wonderful blaze\nof sound that roused the audience and\nensured the concert finished with a bang.\nFELIX Friday May 20th198813 "

He\nexplained that the decisions\nconcerning Mr Rose and the Bar and\nSnack Bar staff had been taken after\n12-13 hours of meetings and stressed\nthat they had not been made lightly.\nHe stated that an emergency\nExecutive meeting had taken place\n2lh weeks ago, at which all the\nExecutive officers, except Alan Rose,\nhad been present. The meeting was\nalso attended by the Union Bar\nlicence es, Dr Robert Schroter and\nMrs Jen Hardy-Smith, Dave Peacock,\nthe Union Manager, and by Chris\nMartin and Nigel Baker as observers.\nA second meeting took place where\nMr Rose was present in order to\nanswer accusations. It was at a third\nmeeting that it was decided to relieve\nMr Rose of his duties concerning the\nUnion trading outlets. This decision\nhad been made unanimously, said Mr\nParsons. He went on to say that the\nExecutive felt that Mr Rose had not\nfulfilled his responsibility and that he\nhad been obstructive when working\nwith the Union Bar licence es. He said\nthat he felt that all the decisions which\nhad been made in the last few weeks\nhad been in the best interests of all\nstudents.\nMr Rose said that in his opinion\n'certain facts' had been distorted by\nthe Union President. He also believed\nthat the Union had 'taken on too much\ntoo soon' as far as the outlets were\nconcerned.\nSeveral more questions were tabled\nfrom the floor until a vote was taken\nat 2.50pm as to whether any more\ndiscussion should take place on the\nissue. The meeting decided after a vote that it did not wish to carry on\nthe debate and the agenda went back\nto the minutes and reports.\nAt this point, Philip Drew,\nPresident of St Mary's Medical\nSchool Union, stood up to speak. He\nsaid that he was appalled at how badly\nthe meeting had been conducted and\nthat he would suspend all negotiations\nbetween his and IC Union until ICU\n'put its house in order'. He then lead\nhis fellow St Mary's students from the\nmeeting.\nLater he told FELIX that this had\nnot been just a spontaneous reaction,\nbut that he had for some weeks been\nupset at the way his union was being\ntreated. He condemned the fact that\nthe AGM achieved so little and said\nhe felt the chairing of the meeting was\npoor. St Mary's meetings were much\nmore civilised and ordered, he said,\nand they got much more done.\nThe meeting finally decided to\nconsider the annual reports. A motion\nwas passed mandating the FELIX\nEditor to write an annual report. Such\na motion is not technically within the\nremit of a UGM. The by-laws state\nthat 'the officers of the Union shall\nbe responsible for carrying out the\npolicy of the Union as determined by\na General Meeting'. The FELIX\nEditor is not classed as a Union\nOfficer in these by-laws. The UGM\nmay choose to dismiss a FELIX\nEditor but no other practical power\nover the FELIX Editor. But by this\ntime nobody was paying too much\nattention to procedure.\nThere was another procedural\nmotion, calling for the elections to be\nrun, which was passed. All elections\ntook place with only the GUC\ndelegates elections being referred\nback to the next Union General\nMeeting. Quorum was then called\nduring a motion on Human Rights\nWeek and the meeting was closed at\n3.30pm. Professor Alan Cowley, currently of\nthe University of Austin in Texas, is\nto take the Sir Edward Frankland\nchair of Inorganic Chemistry at\nImperial. He will succeed Sir\nGeoffrey Wilkinson, FRS and Nobel\nLaureate, who has been at Imperial\nfor 32 years.\nThe appointment comes at a time\nwhen the Chemistry Department,\nunder its new head, Professor John\nAlbery, has plans to widen its\nactivities. There is to be close\ncollaboration between the Department\nand the new Interdisciplinary\nResearch Centre in Semiconductor\nGrowth, Characterisation and\nProcessing.

These faults included\nproblems with roofing, drains and\ngutters as well as certain breaches of\nfire regulations. The Local Authority\nserved inspection notices on the\nlandlord which required him to carry\nout work on the properties to bring\nthem up to standard.\nAlthough the Local Authority does\nhave some discretion on how long\nthey can allow landlords to carry out\nmaintenance work in general, this\ndoes not apply where fire regulations\nhave been breached. In any case,\nCollege Secretary John Smith told\nFELIX, it would be irresponsible to\nhave students living in the building if\nthis work was not carried out.\nIt is thought that the investment that\nthe landlord would have to make in\norder to bring the accommodation up\nto an acceptable level for students\nwould be so high that he would be\nmore likely to want to sell the\nbuildings outright or redevelop them\nas luxury flats.\nuseful in this respect.\nAlan Cowley was born in\nManchester on 29 January 1934. He\nreceived a BSc -with Honours in\nChemistry from Manchester\nUniversity, where he also earned an\nMSc in 1956 and a PhD in 1958. For\nthe next two years he worked at the\nUniversity of Florida, before taking\nthe post of Technical Officer with the\nExploratory Group of Imperial\nChemical Industries (Billingham\nDivision). In April 1962 he started as\nAssistant Professor of Chemistry at\nthe University of Texas, and in 1984\nhe was appointed George W Watt\nCentennial Professor of Chemistry.\nProfessor Cowley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March\nthis year.\nThe Landlord, Mr Dangoor, was\nunavailable for comment, however it\nappears that he has actually offered\nto sell the houses to College. It seems\nunlikely, however, that the College\nResidence Account could afford to\ncompete in price with developers.\nLoretta O 'Callaghan,\nAccommodation Officer, has\nexpressed her regret at the loss of the\nplaces, but said that there were one\nor two alternative places that they\nwere looking into.\nSydney Harbour-Bridge was also\nsaddened by the news, especially in\nlight of the fact that they had already\nlost 50 places in Hamlet Gardens and\nanother 22 in Earls Court Square. It\nwould make life more difficult for\nthose who had already been accepted\nto live there next year, he said, though\nthere was no suggestion that these\npeople would not get places\nsomewhere.\nThe houses had been known to be\nunder threat for some time, but it was\nonly in the last couple of weeks that\nMalcolm Aldridge of Finance\nSection, who had been negotiating\nwith the landlord, decided that there\nwas little prospect of a settlement\nwhich would mean College keeping\nthe houses.\nThe present lease for the buildings\nruns out at the end of June.\nPassed the post\nGill Knowles has been returned\nunopposed as next year's Women's Officer at this year's Annual General\nMeeting.

From\nan early age the combination of\nDennis' own intellect and the\neducation provided by his father,\nBertalan, gave him more knowledge\nof physics and mathematics than his\nteachers. He and his two brothers\nwere given all the books and\nlaboratory equipment they needed to\nexcel in both the experimental and\ntheoretical sides of physics. Through\nthe family, Dennis learned to speak\ngood German, French and English,\nas well as his native Hungarian.\nAt school he was often bored by the\nwork, which he found too easy, and\nwas unpopular with teachers. He went\non to study mechanical engineering at\nthe Technical University of Budapest\nwhere he began to settle down until\nthe third year when he was called up\nfor military service. Eager to escape\nthe army, he moved to the Technisher\nHochschule in Berlin to per sue an\nElectrical Engineering degree:\n\"Though still at its height at the\ntime, I could not call the TH Berlin\nan ideal institution. There were far\ntoo many students and there was\nhardly any contact between students\nand teachers. It was a sort of slot\nmachine into which one had to throw\nno end of machine designs, essays and\npapers and out came a diploma in the\nend. But it certainly made one get\nused to hard work! My real education,\nand the memory which I cherish most\nat that time, was the Physical\nColloquium at the University, every\nTuesday, and the unforgettable\nseminar on Statistical Mechanics\nwhich I had under Einstein's guidance\nin 1921-22. \"\nGabor finished his first degree in\n1924 and went on to complete a DrIng in 1927. He then joined the\nPhysics Laboratory at Siemens but\nwhen Hitler came to power his\ncontract was not renewed and he\nreturned to Hungary where he worked\non the development of a plasma lamp.\nIn 1934, through Edward Allibone,\nwho was to become a lifelong friend,\nhe came to Britain. For 15 years he\nworked for the British Thomas\nHouston Company. His work at BTH\nwas, to begin with, largely based on\nthe development of the plasma lamp.\nWhen this project was eventually\nfound to be unworkable, he was given\na staff position at the company. With\nthe onset of the war he found himself\nvery restricted in his potential fields\nof research as he was classed an\n'enemy alien' by the British\ngovernment. For this reason he was\nnot allowed to take part in any project\neven vaguely involved with defence.\nHe nevertheless decided to pursue his\nown research on the detection of\nairplanes using the heat from their\nengines and an infrared detecting\nscreen but, when the military found\nout about it, the project was taken\nover and he was prevented from\nworking on it further.\nIn 1938, after the advent of\ntelevision, a worried cinema-chain\nowner persuaded Gabor to develop\nsome way of projecting cinema\npictures in 3-D which he went on to\npatent in 1940.\nIn 1947, Gabor was trying to solve\nthe problem of aberrations in lenses\nin electron microscopy. He had the\nidea of recording the phase\ninformation of a beam of light on an\nintensity sensitive plate by interfering\nit with a reference beam from the\nsame source, and then replaying it by\n8 Friday May 20th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Jobs for the boys( and the girls!)\nDuring the Summer\nvacation many of\nthe College's residences are let to\nvisitors from\noutside the College.\nThe income from\nthese schemes is\nessential if\nreasonable rents in\nthe residences are\nto be maintained.\nThe various\nSummer Letting\nSchemes offer a number of jobs for\nthe vacation period.\nThese vary from\nchallenging full-time managerial\nposts to part-time\ncleaning work. In\ngeneral the work is\nwell paid and\ninteresting; free\naccommodation is\nprovided in most\ncases.\nThe schemes fall into two distinct\ncategories. The Summer Accommodation Centre operates in Linstead\nHall and part of Southside, providing\nhotel standard bed and breakfast\nservice for Conferences and other\nshort stay visitors. This is run under\nthe auspices of the Conference Office.\nThe Summer Letting Schemes include\nEvelyn Gardens, Hamlet Gardens and\nBeit Hall, providing a more basic and\nless expensive form of\naccommodation. The clientele tends\nto be students from other Colleges\nstaying for fairly long periods. These\nschemes are run by the Student\nAccommodation Office. For all the\nschemes marketing is carried out\ncentrally, but during the residence\nperiod most of the work of running\nand maintaining the scheme is carried\nout by students on site.\nSummer Accommodation\nCentre (SAC)\nThis is the most prestigious of the four\nschemes and has a relatively large\nwork force necessary to maintain the\nvery high standards required. The\noffice and reception desk is in the\nfoyer of Linstead Hall and is run by\na member of the Conference Office\nstaff, together with Assistant\nRenumeration\nManagers, Night Managers,\nCashiers/Receptionists. The reception\ndesk is manned day and night\nthroughout the Summer vacation.\nGuests are welcomed, registered and\nbilled on arrival by the reception team\nand shown to their rooms by a porter.\nBehind the scenes, the cleaners\nprepare up to 460 rooms which\ninvolves changing and making beds,\ncleaning wash basins and bathrooms\nand vacuuming carpets. All this has\nto be done in the morning in four\nhours. Cleaners work in pairs, under\nthe supervision of the Housekeeper\nand coordinator, serving 24 rooms\nand three sets of bathroom facilities\non a staircase. There will also be a demand for extra cleaners for between\n7 and 14 days at the start and for\ncleaners to work weekends only.\nHowever accommodation will not be\nprovided for these two categories.\nEvelyn Gardens\nThis is the largest of the schemes\noperated by the Student\nAccommodation Office, and is staffed\nby four assistant managers and nine\ncleaners. All three schemes are\nhowever supervised by a Coordinator. The assistant managers\nrun the office, act as receptionists,\nmaintain booking charts ensuring full\noccupancy where possible, collect\nrents, operate the accounting system\nand supervise the cleaners. The\ncleaners clean rooms, change sheets\nand act as porters.\nHamlet Gardens\nAt Hamlet Gardens three assistant\nmanagers and two full time cleaners\nrun about 50 flats which provide\naccommodation for about 200 guests.\nThe duties are similar to those at\nEvelyn Gardens. These flats provide\naccommodation of a basic standard.\nBeit Hall\nBeit Hall is different from the other\nschemes in a number of ways. It is\nmuch smaller with only 100 rooms\nand the Housekeeper is heavily\ninvolved with the letting s. The Beit\nHall scheme operates with one\nassistant manager, one night manager\nand three cleaners. The assistant\nmanager is responsible for raising all\ninvoices and making sure that guests\npay on time and also acts as an\nassistant to the Housekeeper.\nCoordinators receive a \u00a3 1 0 per week\nresponsibility payment in addition to\nthe above rate. The hours given for\ncleaners and coordinators represent a guaranteed minimum; it is possible\nthat overtime will sometimes be\navailable. The hours given for other\nstaff represent normal hours, but there\nwill be times when extra hours are\nrequired. Although overtime is not\npaid for these extra hours they will\nbe taken into account when assessing\nbonuses.\nThe Summer Letting Schemes offer\nan inter sting and rewarding kind of\nvacation work. At times the work is\nvery hard, especially at the beginning\nand end of the schemes. Those\nworking in the management type jobs\nneed a lot of stamina and patience to\ndeal with large numbers of guests\nwhile working under considerable\npressure. At the same time most\npeople who work on the scheme tend\nto enjoy themselves as well as gaining\nuseful work experience. Please note\nthat in general all staff working in the\nschemes must be prepared to cover\nany emergencies that arise.\nApplication forms are available\nfrom the Student Accommodation\nOffice, 15 Princes Gardens, or Room\n170 Sherfield Building.\nThe Closing date is Friday May 27,\n2.30pm. All students who work in the Summer accommodation, and are eligible for\nLettings Schemes are offered a a discretionary bonus. Wages, hours\ncompetitive wage.
