V.'e followed five\ndrummers leading a Union Jack and ab--out eight other assorted flags carried\nby darkly dressed anonymous characters.\nDown Westboume Park Road and into\nGreat Western Road they marc ned at a_ slow steady pace while the drums beat\nquietly but insistently luring the\noccupants out of houses al on \u00a3 the way.\nLittle boys appeared in ever increasing\nnumbers and fell in behind, a shuffling\nill disciplined parody of their elders.\nThey turned into Harrow Road shepherded\nby an outnumbering force of policemen\nthen right, into a gloomy street\nflanked by low drab imitation Georgian\nhouses. By a sign warning us \"Beware\nchildren play here.\" was a loudspeaker van covered by posters.\nThese, advising us. to \"Win with lios ley\" and \"Eat the oy c ott\", explained the\norigins of the nameless band. Union\nMovement was on -the move.\nAbout forty people clustered round\nwaiting for the s pea er. Beyond them\nthe police waited, constables directing\nthe traffic and v/at ching while their\nofficers moved about issuing instruct--ions. The gathering swirled slightly and an outer ring of trench coated men\nsuddenly appeared spaced about one\nevery three yards. A man also wearing\na trench coat appeared on top of the\nvan looking over the crowd and away to\nthe end of the street. It was Mosley,\nin his trench coat, looking shorter and\nplumper than his poster picture.\nHe spoke into a microphone with a voice swift and persuasive Ww\nshould not achieve anything by rioting. Our experience of race riots has shown\nthi3. If we wanted to be rid of the\nblacks and send them back to Jamaica\n\"then why not join Union Movement in our\ntens of thousands. Then as a powerful\npolitical party we could achieve our\naims and provide money from the National\nExchequer to pay for comfortable pass--ages for negroes returned to Jamaica\nand for the provision of well paid jobs\nthere. The better type would be glad\nof this opportunity and the others\nwould be shipped out anyway. He re--ml nde d his audience of Englands great\npast and now the pitch of his voice\nwas rising. It had lost its warmth and\nbe oom e harsh England had been betrayed\nbut we could still regain what we had\nlost. The trench coats cheered and\nMosley continued his harangue. We\nwere reminded of the hysteria of a Hitler or a Mussolini heard on old\nnews recordings, but there were no\nmassed regiments to retort with terrible ry th mic cries of adulation, and Hosley's words disappeared down the miserable\nstreet to be lost unrecorded among the\ntraffic rumbling along the main road.\n\"Only join in and march behind the\nmagnificent band\", he implored. \"Pay\na small subscription\" and all would be\nattained. Come to his headquarters.\nMarch back with him that night. Only\ndo something for England1\ns sake. Again\nthe faithful applauded and the meeting\nwas over.\nAbout six of the trench o oats gathered nearby. The drum band was\nreforming. On its right flank stood\ntoo blond youths, tall, slender and\nproud. My companion remarked \"What\nperfect physical specimens of Hitler youth.\" Immediately a short fat trench coat'.tum ed on him , \"What\ndo you mean poor physical spec i men? That poor physical specimen\ncould knock you out in no time.\"\nObscenity dribbled from the corner\nof his mouth and he invited us\nto name a time and a place when\nthe poor specimen would make\nmincemeat out of us . Cowardly\nby nature and overawed by their\nsuperior numbers we did not reply\nando swearing and laughing quietly\nthey faded.j into the gloom further\nup the street .\nThe \"magnificent band\" led the\ntrench coats.and a few women ,\nfreshly recruited perhaps, on the\nmarch home . Now proud of their\nincreased number they disposed\nof the small boys who were chased\nonto the pavement. There the\npolice were restraining a rather\nviolent young cyclist, \"but I hate Moslay' , I have a right\nto hate\"Mosley , haven'tI.\" he\nshouted.\n\"Not here,\" was the reply\nand he was led off by a sergeant\nwhile a constable brought his bio y cle along behind .\nby I.L. Gibson.\nAt the Old Vic the most\ncontroversial new production this\nseason has been Visconti's \"Romeo\nand Juliet\" \u2022 The Italian producer\nhas succeeded where many of his predecessors failed, in bringing to\nthe London stage a real Veronese\natmosphere.^ The decor and ao tors both contribute to this illusion; the sets, the street scene in particular, have a really authentic\nring, while the young men of Verona\nstrut around and fight with hotheaded enthusiasm, just as one\nimagines they did in the far off days\nof the \"Romantics\"\nHowever; while h^s eyes were\nbeguiled, your correspondent felt that\nthe rather elaborate production\nsomehow tended to submerge Shakespeare's words and hence the production lost a good deal of its impact. The play\nas a whole became unconvincing and\none never really believed Juliet was\nin love with Romeo; one only saw her\ngoing through the motions. But don't take my word for it go and see this\nmuch discussed production for yourself.\nTommy Steele fans have a chance\nof seeing their idol when Goldsmithfe\n\"She Stoops to Conquer\" is produced at\nthe Old Vic on November 8 th. Mr. Steele\nplays the part of Tony Lumpkin, while\nleggy lou nt, of ''Sailer Beware\" fame,\nwill.be. appearing as Irs.Hardoastle..\nIn a less^\u00bbr4i \u00bbssi j ni in j, \u00abne. of the\nbest Musicals to coed on the London\nscene during the long vac is \"Oliver\".\nThis rather che a red up version of\n\"Oliver Twist\" can now be seen at the\nNew Theatre. Of course the freshman\ncannot go far wrong in taking his lady frio nds to \"My Pair Lady\" at the\nTheatre Royal Drury lane, or \"West\nSide Story\" at her Majesty's Theatrethat is of course if his predecessor\nhasn't already done so!

A. Man, like I'm mad, mean I'm up\nthe groove without a stylus. After\nreading Rimshot's sleeve notes in the last squares' song sheet, I got\nsent and played a riff in the local sax supermarket, like I wanted a Rimshot do-it-yourself hard bop out-fit,( man, the doll on that o ash register, she was pounding the keys\nlike Thelpnius Konk, but couldn't blow nothing but A major. Pow, was\nshe ou bic.'), I was rolling the life size model of Uranus up Earl's Court\nRoad, when this cop rides up in his motorised vibes, like he was playing Land of Hope and Glory on the\nsiren.\nThis bum gets out his manuscript\nbook and says \"I. an, that way you' 11\nbe doing your next solo on a steel-bar harp with a cement sound box.\" This didn't figure to me, like nobody's played me any legal discs\nabout not rolling planets up Earls\nCourt Road. So I played this guy two\nor three bars about not reading the\nroad traffic a ot, and he took off like he'd just heard Parnsworth practising\nhis extending trump ot. \"Kan\", he said,\n\"You're rolling that planet up a oneway street, that is, while the\nMotor Show is still playing.\" So he\nslung me in his jug-box, and made for the clink like he was five bars behind\nthe rest of cue combo.\nNext morning, I made a one day\nstand in the witness box, and blew my\nsolo at the leader of the long-haired\nguys on the be noh, making out like I played some blue notes at the cop by\nmistake, but that magistrate' He was\nsquare inn dimensions, like he thought\nMantovani had the swinging est outfit ever. This hunk, he says \"don't play\nthese chords in here, my man\", and\nslings the book at me. He thinned out\nmy let tuo e some, the pay ola was .220,\nfor riding a planet without lights and\ninsurance, going the wrong way up a one way street, and confusing the\nJodrell Bank tele s oops. So thats why I don't dig\nRimshot's outfit now. I traded it for a1/ I0d Jenitoys jazz set. Why,\nman, their cardboard guitar is supplied complete with Bert Weedon,\nand I traded him for an E.P. of\nLilo s Davis.

SIR CYRIL HINSnXLWOQD.\nNEW ENGINEERING BUILDING Since 1884 successive generations of\nengineering students have bean entering\nthe red brick, building designed by\nWaterhouse on Exhibition road, and\nwhich became the City and Guilds College.\nOn the evening Of Friday 4th November\na reception held at Imperial Collegethe same boll wh i oh 'was used to call\nstudents to lectures in1884 was rung\nagain to mark the transition from the\nold building to the new - now fully\ncom miss in red as the first part of the\nlarger building for Mechanical\nEngineering.\nUnder the guidance of men like\nUnwin and his successors, the growth\nof engineering education has been p phenomenal during the last 75 years.\nThere were some ,,200 engineering students\nwhen the City and Guilds College was\nfederated to form part of the Imperial\nCollege in 1907. By 1952 there were\nnearly 8001 today there more than\n1,250 and the planned number is1,750. The major increase during the past eight\nyears is the result of the Government1\ns decision to expand the Imperial College;\nand the number of engineering students\nboth undergraduate and postgraduate,\noo ul d only be increased by the provision\nor more space and up-to-date facilities.\nThe new building, of which the\nfirst instalment has now gone into\nservice, will be completed some three to\nfour_ years he no e. It will take the place\nof the bid buildings on Exhibition\nRoad,which will be progressively demolished\nto make room for it. It will be 440\nfeet long, and on nine floor levels,\nand will provide teaching and research\nfacilities for more than 330 students\nof Mechanical Engineering and for some\n300 of the engineering students from\nthe other Departments of the College.\n&k well as major groups working on\nApplied Theraodynamics ( all'subjects\nconcerned with oom bust ion and with heat\nand mass transfer) and Applied Mechanics\n( metal fatigue, plasticity, stress\nanalysis and the like ), the Department\nalso in o lude s sections studying nuclear\npower and production engineering.\nThe new building will form the eastern\nboundary of a new East Quadrangle,\nbounded on the south and west by other\nnew-trail dl Mg g now-n nder construction for\nCivil and for Electrical Engineering.\nDesigned by Messrs. Normen and Dawbarn,\nthe building is of composite construction\nwith structural steel and reinforced\nconcrete frames. External treatment is similar to that adopted for the new\nbuilding-for the Physics Department\n( opened last month by Sir John Cockcroft)\n- white mosaic columns and sp and rel walls\nfaced with green Swedish tiles.\n\n"

Furthermore, the pro--portion .of personal attacks in such o on tri but ions has been comparable with the\nproportion of personal attacks in the\nweekend speeches of Labour Party leaders.\nUnless we wish all discussion of Union L affairs to resolve itself into personal\ninvective, then it might be useful to im--pose a ban on the publication of all un-signed\u2014or wrongly signed\u2014contributions.\nIt is small comfort for those attacked to\nknow that the writers have not the courage\nof their convictions and are unprepared\nto substantiate their allegations. The\nvery fact that the \u2022\"\u2022tides ar\u00ab nub lia he d. \u2014 especially when s is ned with seemingly\nauthentic names\u2014can give the impression\nthat there is some substance in the articles. Several people have commented oh the\nimprovement to the Union Lounge now that\nthe carpets have been laid.' However the\nfact that old lags are seeing an improve--ment doesn't cut much ice with aesthetically minded fresher s or Saturday night\nhoppers from outside. Although the difficulties of making a large room look\nCOUNTER By B. T.L. In the column Comment one union\nmember presents his views and criticisms on the various controversies which per--en ni ally assail us. Obviously his column presents one view only. This\ncolumn is in tea it. ed to reply to these\nor it io is j is, and to offer opposing arg--um ents, although the views of this writer are not necessarily opposed to\nthose of our commentator.\nSane people have been vociferously\noom plain ing that the last editor of\nFELIX printed anonymous letters cont--a in ing personal attacks. This is not\ntrue. In none of the letters printed\nwas any individual mentioned or referred\nto, and all the authors were known to\nthe editor. Unfortunately there are\nin the College certain groups ho will never accept that the other side has a case. If a letter bearing the name\nof a protagonist of one side appears the\nother side dismisses it as pro pog and a. Thus in order to present a case wh i oh will be debated on it a merits it is. sometimes neo ess ary to adopt a pseudonym\nThe Felix Board stipulates that the\neditor must know the true name of the\nauthor, but, providing the case pre sen r ted is a good one, there seems no nec--ess it y for appending the true name of\nthe author. Perhaps some people o an not understand that there are Union\nmembers who don't write for FELIX just to be oom ewell known.\ncosy are considerable, the same excuse\ncan hardly explain the cold and bare IOOK\nof the smaller lounges in the Union 3ui ld ing. Apart from anything else, our\nUnion Building must be amongst the poorest\nwhe i.t comes to paintings. We have, it is true, two loyal photographs in the\nUnion Lounge and odd daubs elsewhere, bu1 nowhere is there anything hanging which\none would care to look at twice. It i3 difficult to see the reason for this, be--cause pictures, unlike other items of\nexpenditure, can even increase, in value\nwith age and the purchase of pictures of\nartistic merit cannot therefore be said\nto constitute a threat to the Union\nassets.\nIt seems a pity that it has been\ndecided to hold only one Union meeting\nthis term. This breaks a tradition of\nmany years standing that two meetings are\nheld in the autumn term, one for the\npresentation of'Accounts and one for any\nother important business. The next meet--ing on November 15th. will be the first at which the quorum of 400 becomes legal\nand unfortunately, due to this break in tradition, some societies had already ar--rar i ged meetings for this date before\nthis change was announced. In addition\nthe crowded agenda makes that either\nthere will be a very short discussion on\nimportant topics, or the meeting will go\non after2.30 p.m. and be in danger of be--coming in quo rate. Next term I3 Ug ge3t the Union meetings be announced well in advance and if the agenda appears likely to be crowded, an extra meeting could be\narranged.\nCOMMENT Fotheringham.\nOn the question of Union lounges\nI find myself in a green w it with Mr. Cox.\nThe intra i uc tl on of carpets to the low--er lounge has raised the standard to\nthat of a first ol as s station waiting\nroom. Who knows but what we may not\na oh i eve the standard of a second class\nhotel foyer in two or three years time.\nOf course a few good pictures would\nhelp to make the lounges attractive and\nwould prove a sound in ves ian ent; if Mr.\nCox would loan us. say \u00a3100,000 I am\nsure Council would buy the odd Van Gogh,\nand in years to come would sell at a vast profit.*\nMay I offer my condolences to our\ncommentator as he bemoans the passing\nof the age-old tradition of two Union\nmeetings in the Michelmas term. How-ever, it is not really\" possible to\njustify a Union meeting solely for pas--ing the accounts as there is usually\nvery li it le discussion on this subject.\nIt is unfortunate that this Union meet--ing clashes with some society functions\nbut it is not possible to decide the\ndates of Union meetings before the beg--inning of term as these are arranged\nin o on jun tion with the General Studies\nBoard. As many societies arrange\ntheir meeting during the previous term\nthis clash seems inevitable. We are\nall somewhat apprehensive as to whether\nthe meeting will achieve the neo ess ary400 quorum. However providing our\nPublicity Officer justifies his pos-- it ion there should be little difficulty in raising400 he fd s from a2,800 pop--ul ation. FOR CONTINUED You cannot change the traditions\nof an institution by an over-night\nrevolution, but you o an do all in your power to improve it little by\nlittle. That is why I regard with\nfavour the trebling in the number\nof the social clubs in the last few\nyears) although each one has been\nestablished in the teeth of the\nopposition of the stupidest form\nof conservatism.....Softly, softly, catches monkey,....One day this college will be important because\nwe will have learned how to have a social conscience.\nI think it is important that the\nUnion should do all in ip i power to\neducate itself. This is why I feel that members of the Union should\nlearn to choose their own President\nand o ease to allow the choice to be\nmade for them. Some people say that\nthe members of the Union are too\ni rr espn sib le to elect their own\nPresident. This is not true of the\nvast majority of college unions\nand I do not believe it to be true\nof this Union.lf it were true then\nsurely itf is the making of decisions\nthat causes people to be responsible\nand the vicious circle of\nirresponsibility must be broken\nsooner or later. Some people say i look at the King's fracas or the\nBattersea fracas, by way of evidence\nagainst a popularly elected President.\nBu i there have been some fairly good\nImperial fracases in the past two\nyears and we do not elect our\nPresident. I think the truth of the\nmatter is that probably the same\nman would be elected either by the\nUnion or by the Counoil.\nNow some people will pick on\nthe last statement tp prove that\nthere is no. reason to make the\nchange, and they will have completely\nmissed the point. The effect the\noh ange will have will be to causa\na far larger number of people to\nthink.and argue about the qualities needed in a good President. To the\nextent that to improve the output\nof Imperial College its members should\nlearn to argue and discuss, an election\nfor President would be a good thing.\nBob Finch.\nCOMING SOON COMING EVENTS\nCATHOLIC SOCIETY\nMaa.

I think,\nand I am sure that most readers will agree with me, that :^uc:i can be done\nto improve the appearance of the\npaper. Compared with other college\nnewspapers in the University, FELIX is a very shabby affair. In the method\nof production which we use at present\nnK st of our efforts go into actual\nprinting :>nd far too little into the\nediting and writing which form the sub--stan oe of the paper. The only ad--vantage that this method commands is that it is cheap so that we o an manage\nwithout external revenue (e.g. grant\nfrom the Union, fees for advertising\netc.) If we are to radically change\nthe appearance of FELIX then we must\nadopt a printing process w hio his, of\nnecessity, much more expensive.\nSince we barely make a profit on cur\nsales as we stand there is all too\nlittle latitude for Improvement if we\no on tin v.c without fine nti al hell; Two\nmain sources exist, revenue from oom--mercia l advertising, s nd direct grant\nfrom the Union, both of which are be--ing explored at the moment.\nThe other main difficulty which\nFELIX faces is the lack of variety of and depth of material which appears in its columns. This is inevitable owing\nto the small oi role of people actively involved. But I am sure that this is not a true reflection of the talent at Imperial College. Remember that to many people outside the College FELIX\nis the only organ of communication and\nas suo h should record pr act i oll y every\nactivity and opinion within the Students\nUnion as well as provide features of general interest.

Granulated Sugar are available at\na differential of j/ lj d. per cw t. under the\noost of an eq i valent quantity of 2 - lb. p packets. A single sack taken from a ret-ail grocer who is not in the habit of selling sugar in bulk,would however,be\nsubject to an additional delivery charge\nof 2/\u2014 per cw t. approximately,wh i oh would narrow the saving to l/l gd per ow t. In view of the fact that it will take you one oo lle ge year( thirty weeks\nof term time)to exhaust a supply of sugar purchased in this way,we feel that\nthe saving will be problematical.\nOne further point should be\nborne, ist mind, the grocery trade frequently treats packet granulated aa a \"loss-leader\"and sugar is. available at out prices from many retail outlets.\nIt may well be possible for you to purchase 2-lb.packets of granulated\nsugar for as little as l/2d. or l/3d.in your vio in it y, and at this price,they\nwould in fact,be cheaper fo purchase than\nthe equivalent quantity in a1 cw t. sack.\n*bs difficulties of transportation,the\npossibility of a stock of sugar spoiling i \u00a3 retained on your premises forth_ s length of time must also be borne in mind\nand we personally cannot-advise this method of purchase in your instance.\nWe hope that the above-mentioned\nfacts will enable you to compare the relative merits of purchasing sugar either\nin packet as required or in bulk.\nYours Faithfully, Tate and Lyle ltd.

Many members of the Union have exp--res sed disapproval of the system by\nwhich the President of the Union is ele c ted, that is by the joint meeting of new\n,and retiring Councils at the end of the\nsession, and instead would prefer to see\nhim elected from the floor at a Union Gen- era l Meeting. At the forthcoming Union\nmeeting Mr. Richard Lewis is to propose\na motion in favour of this latter course\nand will probably meet with some bitter opposition. In order to give the ord--in ary members of the Union food for thought before this meeting we publish\nthe two articles below, one by a sup--or ter and one by an oppose r. AGAINST The majority of students at college\nare idealistic,socialist in their be-ha vi our. This is a good feature because\nit induces a very questioning attitude\nto the society in which the student lives.\nHowever,sometimes students are swept downriver in their boats of demo c rao yj by the|\ntime they have manned the oars of practicality, their little craft is lost on the \u00bb. v sea. at. d is organisation. This?\nis the danger of- the idea of the President\nof the Union being e leo ted by a poll of\nUnion members and not by Council.\nThe proposer s of this motion have\nthe best of motives;the furtherance of\nDemocracy. However,let us consider the\npra ot i cali ties. What does the President\nhave to do?He represents the Union at\noutside functions;he is chairman of Counc il and must be able to work amicably\nwith them;he is the major contact between,\nstaff and students and must be acceptable\nto both bodies;last,but by no means least\nha is intimately o ono er ned with the administration of the Union and must therefore\nbe familiar with the processes involved.\nFOR 'The ideal output of the Imperial\nCollege remains a swam of mechanical,\ne leo tr ical and chemical business smart ies, guaranteed to have no capacity for\nsocial leadership constructive criticisms\nor original thought' - H.G. Walls.\nIt as impossible to be * member at\nthis college without feeling some\nsentimental attachment to it, so that it hurts a little to realise that there is an element of truth in Wells' words. If you ask yourself how many great men have\ncome from this place since it was\nThus obviously, the candidate oust\npossess certain qualifications. It seems\nfitting that Council,who have a knowledge of such matters should select the\nPresident,who may,by the way,be nominated\nby any member of the Union. The Council\nis elected by the Union.and if they make\na poor choice, as* is, unlikely, they could\nbe instructed by the Union to ask the\nPresident for his resignation.\nThe election of the President by a poll of Union members is a system fraught\nwith dangers. Firstly,there i a the danger\nof the President being a \"popular hero\"\nbut totally incapable of doing the job;in\nthis case,as happened at Battersea two\nyears ago,the outcome is disastrous. The\nUnion folds up and the Governing body\nstep in,thus reducing the power of the\nstudents to run their own Union. Secondly, the elected candidate may be unacceptable to Council in the sens* that\ntheir views may be radically opposed.\nThe administration will suffer since\ncontinual argument will slow down the\nprocesses of decision and legislation.\nFinally,in a college of 2,800 it Is impossible for any one person to know more\nthan a small percentage of the members of\nfounded the answer isi few in comparison\nwith Oxford and Cambridge in the same\nperiod.\nYou may be tempted to enquire\nthe cause of this sad state of affairs\nand I am inclined to think that the\nanswer to the inquiry lies in the a absence of an e duo ation in certain\nsocial graces at this college. Who\no an bar a great man if he spurns every\noh allen ge of dialectical exercise\nor mental effort and has a mind\nmade up, not wishing to be confused\nwith facts? Who has not learned in his student days even the rudiments\nof the democratic game?\nCent, oh page five.\nthe Union. In the election of the Iresid\u2014\nent,where personal qualities are much\nmore important than policy,it is essential\nthat the voters know the candidates. The\nonly way this o an be achieved,short of\nhaving whistle-stop tours of the depart-ment s, is by having the President elected\nby Council.\nWho would bother voting and who would\nbe eligible to vote?The apathy at college\nis such that a large number of students\nwould not record their votes and he nc s the President could not be said to be\ntruly representative. As to who is going\nto vote,the definition of which life\nmembers of the Union are to vote,is\nextremely difficult,if at all possible.\nMy personal test when people say that\nthis change would be a good thing,is to\nlook at the three constituent college\nPresidents,who are e leo ted by a democratic\nprocess. Have the constituent college Presidents been better at their jobs than\nthe President of I.C? The answer,to'my\nmind,is emphatically no.\nTherefore,I see no point in changing\nthe pro sent s yate m, and It rust that that\nUnion will not be swept off its feet*by\na watery wave of sham democracy at the\nnext Union meeting.\nFindlay D.

    "content": "FELIX3 THE I CW A Having obtained equality in the\nM to 5 world of I.C., the fair sex is now lau noh in gits campaign for equality\nin its social life. The major anomaly\nt men-only-in-the-bar has been successfully attacked.\nAfter the final fresher s' dinner\n(mixed ), several slightly inebriated\naquariums attempted to rush the main\nentrance to the bar. Tradition pre-vai led. This however was just a blind\nfor the daring young ladles who stressed\nthe ultimate aims of equality by entering\nthrough the door by the mens' lavatory*\u00a5e just want to touch it l? They swiftly found themselves outside.\nSUFFRAGETTES Drinks were served in the\nhall, and one young finishing school product downed a pint without\nstopping. She then lost interest in the proceedings.. I don't know wh i oh sex takes its liquor the better, but\nthe men of I.C. allowed them to walk'\nover to the sacred alter of happiness\nand place their glasses on it. Far\nfrom being resisted in this symbolic\ngesture I saw one I.C. man hiding a girl under his jacket\nBut for Howard, who knows what\nwould have been the result, ler hap s men would have been forbid a en from\nthe bar and have to wait patiently\nin the lounge trying to avoid the\nlecherous gaze of passing girls. Or\nmaybe curtains would be put over\nthe cold, black bar windows and\nworst of all aquarium bar maids on a rota.\nHowever, with true decorum they\nwere eso or ted out but the first blow\nhas been struck and the question\nagain arises \"Do the men of I.C. really want to exclude women from\nthe bar?\"\nL'C In def e reno e to those whose views- do\nnot oo in oi dew \u2014 the j's in the famous\ntrial recently concluded, I hb persuaded to write t \u2014 - art iole.

Thus by raising tha\noost of living the council is sub sidi sing the a ost of dying.\nSKELETON IN THE CUPBOARD Recently German Youth has\nstarted to ask searching questions\nabout the events of the war. There\nhas been awakened interest in the\nsearching out and trial of Bast war\nor imina ls. The swastika daubing of\nCologne synagogue sparked off a nation wide protest in which the\nyouth of Germany played a oom mend& bly o on a nicu ou a Dart. low\nof course we have'the Eiohraejan trial. It was a paradoxical feature\nof the Bermany of the Fifties\nthat there were no Nazis, or even\nex-Nazis to be found. The war w;s over, it must be forgotten. From this\nhead in the sand attitude, the German\npublic has swung round and reo ent ly Curzio Malaporte1\ns books have been\npublished in Gexmanv in paper backs.\nShe Germans\u2022 interest is very personal,\nbut to people in this country who,\ncompared to the holocaust of central\nEurope lead an almost sheltered\naw j jr ten oe during the war, the interest\nIs in looking at tha rise, motives\nand effects of a false sick truth.\nOursio Malaporte was in a unique position to observe this a lok truth, ea war correspondent of one\nof the leading Borne dailies he had\n\u2022o arte blanche1 to all theatres\nOf the war.

Strangely\nthe picture painted la oom io,a bizarre macabre landscape of\ngrotesque humour. He tells of the\nsnow-madness of the Alpenjaegen in Finland, tha terrifying resignation\nof Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, the\nhideous sick refinement and culture\nof the Nasi ruling elite, the massive\ndefiance of Russian resistance.\nThis set out in parables of animal a, which for Malaporte are symbols of the\ntragedy and irony of a kaput te Europe\nIn its death dan oe, the horses, flies dogs, the rats of Jussy.\nthis monumentally grim farce is an oblique attempt as analysis of the\nsick truth as well as being a documentary\nof the wake of \"that slow monster\ndragging itself towards Jerusalem to\nbe reborn\". Although it suffers greatly\nas a novel from being episodic and\nrepetitive, its strength lies in the\nauthenticity of incident, the acid\nanecdotes and the portrait of the\neffect of such crass in homini ty and\nbra t ali ty has on the men caught up\nwith it. Sensitive men like Malaperts\nhimself, or like the cultured Frank,\ntha Nazi King of Poland.

    "content": "AND FELIX MATCHES VERSUS MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS Gold weather and rain-i in fortunately marred the first nee tin\" of the season\nRUG GER AND SOCCER On Jaturciiy 2,th October the 1st,2 nd, and third elevens travelled to\nSouthampton for friendly matches\nagainst the University. The 1st XI\nplayed well, and showed a distinct, improvement on their performance in the first match. The result of the\n:xi to h was 2-1 to Southampton, but a draw would have been a fairer ref lec tion of the play. It was pleasing to\nsee fresher Dave Loftus, at right b aol caid Lave Hunt, at left half, playing so strongly and well. The 2nd XI also lost, by 3-0/ to\na strong Southampton side. Southampton\nwore held to a10 lead in the first half, but after half-time, their greater\nstamina told and they ran out worthy\nwinners\nOf the three' teams playing at\nSouthampton the 3rd XI put up the\nbest performance,, and with Rod\nVi'il shaw scoring twice, I.C. won 5-3.\nOn Wednesday 2nd November, all I.C. teams playing were engaged in league matches. The 1st. XI, not\ntaking advantage of a strong wind in the first half, lost 1-3 to Kings I, This was a great disappointment after\nour fine display of the previous\nSaturday. The 2nd XI, playing away,\nlost03 to King's II, while the 3rd XI, playing at Harlin~ton, went down\nby the same 3core to Q.M. C. II. The\nfifth XI, however, won convincingly\nby 5-0 against Northern Poly.\nNovember 3th saw the 1st XI resting for their match against Mannheim\nUniversity to be played on the .follow-ing day, and the 2nd XI took the\nopportunity of showing 1st XI how to\nwin.'Playing in an away league match at\nCondon School of Economics, they\n\"soundly thrashed the opposition and\nwon by 6-2. The 3rd XX, not to be\noutdone, also won, by 3-0 against\nNorthern Poly, their second clear win\nin succession. The fourth XI, playing\nagainst Old Templonians at Harlington,\nin a friendly were well beaten by\n5-0, and the seventh team also lost by\n5-2 against 3or ough Poly.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union. S.W.7 at Hurlmgham Park or. Sat. Nov. 5th. against L.S.E. and Kannheim University.\nIn spite of this, the match resulted\nin a very close finish between I.C. and,\nMannheim, with the German team winning\nby three points.\nKost of the I.C. sucess es came in the three field events - with some goo c performances fr on Connolly who well\nsupported by Allcock. These two ca>fie\nfirst and second in shot and discus and\nsecond aid sixth in the javelin. In the\ntwo relays, I.C. finished second in each\ncase to Mannheim . In the long relay,\n4&0 - 220 - 220- 880, Clifton running\nthe 1+k D handed over in2 nd. place to\nHarrison who ran a fine 220 under appal ling conditions to consolidate thi3 before handing over to meade .Cleator\nrunning the final stage, did well to main ta. in hi3 position and hold off a strong challenge from Heck of L.S.E, In the other relay, hk-0 -33\u00b0 - 220 -110 , Spier began well for I.C., narrowly failing to hold off a late\nchallenge from Leger of Mannheim . Blake\nMeade and Soribry drew well away from\nL.S.E. but were unable to close the gap\nwith Mannheim.\nThe next meeting of the season will; be the University Winter Relays at Motspur Park, far which we will need as\nstrong a team aa possible.\nTABLE TENNIS The first week of league matches was\nquite a successful one , with each winning\nits respective match. In the first round\nof the cup the first team scored a72 victory against Goldsmiths I and will go on to play the winner of Chelsea and\nCharing X. The second team were unlucky\nto draw L.S.E. I. as opponents add were\nbeaten by a superior side 9-0.\nI.G. Cameron (Capt.)\nDO NOT FILL IN THIS SPACE UNTIL TOLD\nWHAT TO D0:B On Sunday sixth November the I.C. Soccer\nand Rugby Clubs played the Mannheim University\nclubs at Harlington.\nThe Soccer Club, including the college's University players, lia da fine52 win.\n' The game started off at a fast pace,\nand the German side scored two early\ngoals. Mannheim kept this deserved lead\nuntil the interval, but in the second half\nI.C. gradually got on top. The tannh eim goal was under almost constant pre ;sui-e, and it was not surprising to see the German\ngoalkeeper beaten five time3. Two of\nthese goals were scored with long shots\nby I.C. defenders.\nThe Rufper Club, also including U.L. players, had a closer game, but their greater strength told in the end. The\nfinal score was 16 pts. - 3 pts. in favour\nof I.C. After the matches Mannheim were ent-ert a in ed 'at dinner. The teams then retired to the bar, where a general sing-song and\nthe drinking of much beer oom ple ted an\nenjoyable evening.\nIC MAN CAPTAINS WALES \u2022 Basil Janes brought great honour\nto himself and the college by being\nselected to captain Wales against i'pn gland in an Amateur International Match.\nThe match played on Brighton and\nHove'Albions ground on Saturday 5th. November ended in disaster for Basil, as in the 36th. minute he was carried\noff with a broken leg. The game ended\nin a64 win for England, but Wales\nfought gallantly with ten men.\nI feel everyone i nool leg e would\nlike to wish Basil a speedy recovery,\nand that we will see him in action\nagain later in the season.\nPrinted by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO., 307a Telephone Place, W.14 TeL FUL 79*9\n\n"
