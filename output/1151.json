It encourages scientists\nand engineers to take responsibility for their actions. Pugwash and its president Joseph Rot bl at received the Nobel Peace Prize in\n1 9 9 5 for their efforts towards nuclear disarmament. The Stu dent Pugwash group is guided by\nthe goals and principles of\" The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs\". It is concerned about the social impact of science and seeks ways to prevent\nits misuse. It is also concerned with reducing the danger of armed conflict and seeks cooperative solutions to global problems, and thereby tries to avert the imminent threats to civil-is ation. The IC Student Pugwash group aims to raise the awareness of our responsibility to help to reduce and, when possible, to eliminate the actual and potential harmful effects of the scientific\nand technological research and development. We a reorganising events such as lectures, discussions, workshops and seminars in\nareas like arms control, disarmament( particularly weapons of mass destruction),, sustainable environment and other ethical issues. Nobel Peace laureate Joseph Rotblat will give the inaugural lecture, and workshops on the following topics are envisaged: military research at IC, alternative careers, information warfare, environmental issues, international security, arms export, and ethics in science. For more information on the\nICU Pugwash group, or if you would like to get involved with our work, please contact Carsten Rohr at c. roh r@ic.a c.ukor checkout our website at www. su.ic.a c.uk/ pugwash.

    "content": "[fl Union Felix \u00bb 1 October 1999\nICSM Union\nEach week we hand over a page to one of IC's four faculty unions, and this week it's the turn of the\nSabbatical Med School Union President, Becky England, to explain who she is and what she does.\nWe are now welcoming our second intake of students into the relatively new site at IC. The new fresher s should benefit from the input from last years first years\nenabling us to make life easier for\nthem. Last year was a particularly\nhard year for all of our students\nwithin ICS M.Old were welcoming in the new whilst themselves becoming used to an ewen v iron ment and medical school st ruc ture; and the fresher s were not only dealing with the usual' f res hers nightmares' but also coping with being the first intake of a new\ncourse within a new building. This year we have a relatively\nfresh students union, although some faces have not changed.... Jo Manson has taken the role of Vice President Internal Mary's, with Lizzie Robinson now VicePresident External and Wade Gaye d has become Education rep for Charing Cross. I myself have not been a direct member of the\nstudents' union although I was heavily involved in ICS M RAG Week1999. The rest have all been involved with the organ is ation of various events and clubs throughout theMed School and I'm sure are going to do a fanta stic job over the next year.\nTo begin we have our F RES HERS' WEEK, running from the3 rd to the 9th of October. Our Social Secretaries, Anna and Chewy, with\nthe help of Susie( Treasurer),\nMarissa( Secretary), Alison( Clubs and Socs), Alia( VPI Charing Cross) and Jo; have put together what looks to be a week of shear fun and games,( not taking into\naccount the morning after experiences awaiting any poor unfortunates). Details are given in the fresher s' handbook and on posters around the campuses. On October16 th we are holding the\nICS M Freshers' Ball at Chelsea FootballClub, with a particular favourite of mine as the theme\" Austin Powers\" (watch\nout for girls with weapons where\nyou might not expect, boys, you' d better hold on to your mojo l). Tickets will be on sail at the major campuses when term begins. Throughout the year we hope to holdall the traditional social events theMed School expects\nand also to add some more. Any ideas please send them in our direction! We intend to host the\nsecond ICS M Summer Ball in the\nfirst week of July, a firm date will\nbe set in the near future; anyone interested in standing for Summer Ball chair should watch out for election info, going up in the first\nfew weeks of term.\nClubs and Societies will, as always bean integral part of Med School life, with a club for 9 9 % of\npeoples tastes. The Opera Society\nwill be staging' Crazy For you' in\nDecember, the Dram so cI'm sure\nwill be active at various points\nthroughout the year and the multitude of music socs will be sure to make their presence felt. Sports\ncontinue to flourish at ICS M with\nour1 st Rugby team destined for Europe. For information on any of the clubs either come along to the\nFresher s' Fair on Tuesday5 th October at the Alexander Fleming Building in the afternoon, or con tact myself or the Clubs& Socs rep, Alison Ogilvie. Throughout the coming year\nmany issues close to the hearts of\nthe medics will arise The future of our clinical sites; the future of our sports grounds; the prospect of\nmerger of the sports teams and the development of the new course and the repercussions on both the old and new students .\nThe students' union aims to re pre sent the students' views, and therefore any input will be readily\nreceived. As president( finally, after\nscraping through the nightmare of2 nd MB),I will be based primarily\non the South Kensington Campus, in the Alexander Fleming Building( formerly the BMS). However, my plan,( subject to change!) is to\nspend Tuesday mornings at St\nMary's, Wednesday mornings at\nCharing Cross and every second Thursday lunchtime at The Chelsea and Westminster.\nPlease feel free to call with any\nqueries, problems or general grumbles.

DAVID ROBERTS\nBattle lines are being drawn between the two biggest players in\nthe Higher Eduction world over the\nformat for the new Quality Assura n ce system, due to be introduced\nnationwide later this year.\nIn the middle sits the Quality\nAssurance Agency (QAA), the body\nresponsible for assessing and reporting on the quality of teaching in all\nHE universities and colleges, which\nis in the process of drawing up plans\nto re-invent itself. To one side sits the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and Principles ( CVC P), the owners of the\nQA A, who are demanding that all\njudgements on teaching quality are\nmade verbally. On the other side,\nthe Higher Education Funding Council( HEFCE) insists that numerical scores should be handed out to\nallow easy compromises to be made In Brief\nSABBATICAL CURSE LIFTED\nEarly in the summer it looked as if\nthe so called' ICU Sabbatical Curse'( which has seen elected sabbaticals forced to resign due to failing exams in each of the\nlast three years) was going to hit\nagain, as Med School President\nBecky England failed her 2 n dMB papers. This normally leads to being deemed to be in insufficient\nacademic standard which means you cannot pursue the sabbatical. However, she was fortunately allowed to res it the relevant exams and, having passed this time around, took up her post\nin mid September. SHOW ME THE MONEYMore money seems to beheading towards Imperial courtesy of the governments new Science Enterp rise Challenge. Imperial has been selected as one of eight National Centres of Excellence and has been awarded \u00a3 2 million to help\" promote the importance of enterprise in science and technology\". Experts will help to guide researchers from taking their ideas from conception to the\nmarketplace and attempt t of os between different institutions. They\nare believed t be backed by senior\nfigures in the government who are keen to see standardised, media friendly, University League Tables\nconstructed by the QA A. Forced into a compromise, the\nQA A's latest plan is to split assessment up into three distinct areas\n(teaching & learning, student progression and learning resources)\neach of which would be based around a four point scale where\neach level is described in words\nrather than numbers. Unsurprisingly,\nthe CVC P are less than impressed\nwith this compromise, describing it\nas \"numerical marking by the back\ndoor\". The fact that the QA A plan to\nmark other areas, such as curriculum design and content using a sim ple pass or fail system has hardly\nhelped to bridge the gap. The second battleground is the\nter a more entrepreneurial attitude to engineering. BYELECTION LOOMS A selection of Big names are gathering to fight it out for the conservative nomination for the Kensington and Chelsea by election. The by election comes about as a result of the death of Alan Clark during the summer, and must take place before Christmas. At present former Defence Secretary Michael Portillo is the\nhot favourite to be offered the nomination for the second safest\nConservative seat in the country.\nANOTHER ONE GETS AWAY\nSouthampton University has become the latest major Higher Education institution to quit the National Union of Students. They\njoin UMIST and Imperial as the only major institutions in Britain\nnot to be affiliated to the NUS although the vast majority of Scottish institutions and some Oxbridge Colleges have also chosen not to join the national student body. However, as Southampton students union left\nthrough a debate and vote at a so-called \"light touch\" approach, whereby colleges and universities\nwith a good track record in QA A audits would undergo simplistic\n\" screening\" to see if any further\naction were necessary. The CVC P fear that big name universities would automatically get an easy ride,\ndespite the fact that some do not\nhave n outstanding assessment history - Oxford and Cambridge, for\nexample, have simply refused to let\nthe QA A audit them in the past,\nwhilst some universities with very\ngood teaching records have performed poorly in the assessment due\nto their admin systems.\nWith the new system supposedly\nset to come on line next year (new\ndepartmental benchmark guidelines\nare due for release in March) a year\nof petty squabbling, power bro king and painful negotiation seems cer-tain.\nunion meeting, theN US have denounced this as undemocratic and have forced Southampton to have a referendum in November to decide whether or not to to confirm d is affiliation. STUDENTS STAY AT HOME The number of new students choosing to live at home has risen dramatically, from20.8% last year to22.6% this year according to UC AS. Bizarrely, the\nfigure rises to around36% in\nScotland but falls to17% in\nWales CALL FOR PAY INQUIRY\nFOR LECTURERS\nLecturers attacked the government at the TUC Conference two\nweeks ago for their failure to address the problems of low pay and poor conditions on an a tio nal scale( government policy currently states that pay and conditions are up to the individual institution). The Association of University Teachers( AUT) called for a national inquiry on pay disc rim i nation to assess the extent of\nthe problem across the entire\npublic sector.\n\n"

Cooking really is easy. To prove the point, this\ncolumn will build up slowly, reaching\na full roast before Christmas.\nFor most cooking, you only\nneed a few simple rules. In the Basic\nSkill section I intend to cover a small\nstep along the way each week. The\nMeal Suggestion will then give\ninstructions for making a whole\nmeal, without using anything\nbeyond the skills covered so far. For the more adventurous, there will\nalso be an Advanced Tip containing\nan interesting idea or technique.\nThe Basic Skill\nBoiling Water\nTo start off, this is a really basic but\nvery important skill. First, a few\nwords about pans. Obviously, the\nmain distinction is between non-stick\nand ordinary. For the novice, non stick is probably the best choice,\nalthough there are some things\nwhich are difficult to do with an on stick pan (eg achieving a good gol den brown finish). The other important characteristic is the thickness of\nthe base - in general, pans should\nhave a moderately thick base.\nControlling the temperature\nunder a pan is one of the most\nimportant skills to learn. If the heat is\ntoo great, food will burn, or cook unevenly. If the heat is too low, you\nmay not get the food hot enough for\nthe desired effect. The key to most\ntasks is to vary the temperature.\nWhen boiling a pan of water,\nstart by turning the heat up as far as\npossible. Loads of heat is required at\nfirst to raise the temperature of the\nwater. As a general rule, you should\nnever turn the heat so high that gas\nflames or an electric glow are visible\nround the edge of the pan. When the water is boiling, add the food\nyou want to boil. You will still need to\nheat the pan fairly hard, because\nnow the food needs to be raised in\ntemperature. At the point where the\nwater is boiling, with the food in the\npan, you will need to lower the temperature, so that amount of heat\napplied matches the heat which is\nbeing lost. In this way the pan will\nboil gently, without so much evap oration that the pan may boil dry.\nMeal Suggestion\nPasta with Pesto\nPasta is great. It is easy to cook, full\nof energy, and can be really cheep -and you don't necessarily have to\nmake a complex sauce to go with it.\nPesto is the general name for a paste, made with olive oil, garlic,\nand either hard cheese or nuts. You\ncan buy a basic green basil pesto in\na jar, from supermarkets. Many shops also sell red pesto, which has\nadded tomato. You can mix pesto\nstraight in with pasta, for a good value, tasty meal.\nBoil the pasta as described\nabove, adding a pinch of salt to the\nwater. After the pasta has been\ncooked for the time specified on the\npacket, drain the pan. If possible,\nadd some butter of olive oil to the\npan, and mix into the pasta. Finally,\nsimply stir in about a tablespoon per\nperson of pesto.\nAdvanced Tip\nRosemary and Stilton Pesto\nRosemary and stilton combine really\nwell in a pesto which is ideal with for\npasta, stuffing mushrooms, or ticking under the skin of chicken\nbreasts. Making pesto is great fun -I'm sure there are scientific ways of\ndoing it, but I normally just shove all\nthe ingredients in a blender. Just be\ncareful not to over-blend the stilton.\nIt is ideal to use one of those\nmini food processors, or a hand\nblender with an enclosed attach-ment. For two people, blend the fol-lowing, until smooth:\n5 0 g Pine Kernels (or Cashews)\n3 tablespoons Olive Oil1 large chopped garlic clove\na small clump of fresh rosemary\na few drops of lemon juice\nsalt and pepper\nTo finish, chop60 g of stilton into\nsmall chunks, then add to the pesto.\nBlend for a further 1 0 seconds.\n\n"

    "content": "1 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Union 11\nThe State of the Union\nBy Natasha Newton, Imperial College Union President\nHello, to all the new stu-dents, welcome back to all the old. Well, what a sum mer! To the Freshers, let me intro-duce the column. This is a weekly\nupdate of what the Union is up to, what we as your representatives\nare doing for you and quite often,\nwhy.\nSo,w e've been busy, da Vinci' s has had a big facelift and I hope you agree now looks tasty. It has been a constant battle as the demolition work going on in the rest of\nBeit has over spilled into this end of the building. Honestly, it was like\na French farce at one point, cut water pipes setting of fire alarms, but then they cut through the electrics for the fire alarm!! You should have seen the size of the hole in the men's toilets ceiling! W hat's this all about, then?\nWell, with the creation of a new Education and Welfare Sabbatical that's me comes a greater promotion of the\nnoncommercial services offered\nby ICU and the representation undertaken on your behalf. A full\nbreakdown of the services available to you and the representation\nundertaken on your behalf can be found in the Student Handbook( available from the Union Recep tion). Important issues relating to\nyou, within the Education& We l fare remit, will be aired here. So here goes \u2022 Meningitis All first year students have been encouraged to get vaccina ted for meningitis before arriving at\nCollege. However, two points need to be made: Firstly, overseas students living\nin Halls are especially encouraged to visit IC Health Centre for a vaccination. Secondly, the vaccination only\nprotects against type C meningitis -which only represents30% of meningitis cases reported in the UK. Therefore if you have been vaccinated but still have flu-like\nsymptoms please visit a doctor or call an ambulance to be safe and Down to business. Let's start\nsomewhere familiar, there have been some big changes in the shop this summer, sadly, we have\nlost some old friends, but we have\ngained two new permanent members, Andrew the floor manager and Daniel the System and stock\nclerk. Welcome gentlemen, we hope you survive Fresher's week! The Health Centre. Progress\nindeed, the Union and the centre\nnow have regular meetings to discuss problems our students, their\npatients, encounter. If you have a problem with them, you should talk\ndirect to their Practice Manager in\nthe first instance, but you can still\ncome to us. During the summer iCU surveyed the other University\nask a fire nd to look after you. Don't assume you can't have meningitis purely because you' ve been vaccinated this is NOT the\ncase. If you have not been vaccinated and are worried then IC Health\nCentre will be able to advise and arrange for vaccination. \u2022 Student Support Scheme First and second years are now funded via the Student Support\nScheme, which includes means-tested help towards tuition fees.\nUnder the new rules students have\na deadline by which they must\napply for support, otherwise they\nwill not be eligible for any financial support in future years of study. The\ndeadline is the end of the first term\nof their first year.\nEven if you think you are not eligible for any help with your\ntuition fee you still need to apply. If\nyou do not wish to take out any of\nthe loan: apply, be assessed for support and then ask for \u00a3 0 . The Student Loans Company will then\nhave your details and in future\nyears you will be able to apply.\n\u2022 Welfare at Sil wood Park\nOver the summer the provision\nof London colleges with their own Health Centres to see how they\ncompare to ours. We are now disc us sing these results with the Health Centre, who have taken a real interest.\nIn a big. paper pushing exercise, we have extended and up da ted our reciprocal agreements so your Union card will gain you access to even more Universities\nthan ever before. We have also done special deals for the students\nat Sil wood that they will be able to\ngo over to Royal Holloway to party.\nAs you will see, our sabbatical manifestos have been included in\nthis issue if Felix, so, for the 3 0 0 0\nodd of you who didn't have a chance to vote for us, you can see\nof welfare facilities at Sil wood were\nreviewed. Support links between\nSil wood and ICU are being strengthened and College has agreed provision for extra Counsellor time, allowing for a regular visit to Sil wood by one of the College Counsellors. This is a good start to improved provision at Silw ood. \u2022 Registry\nThe Academic Registrar, Vern on McClure, will be available in\nhis office ( 3 3 9 Sherfield) on Mon days during term-time from1.30 pm to2.00p m.No prior appointment is necessary. This is to\ndiscuss matters other than those\nyou would raise with your Depart ment or routine enquiries that the\nRegistry can help with.\n\u2022 And finally...\nPlease feel free to contact Mar tin (the Union Advisor) or me with\nany questions or queries - you'll\nfind my phone number and email address below.

Chances are that you did. However, it's conceivable that you didn't given that it's release was a slow key as are app on the Saturday now gone, when cars were jamming into Prince's Gardens and all manner of luggage was flowing towards the various Hall entrances. Strange that,\nsince musically it was quite radio friendly foot stamping lya live and a military rhythm\nsignalling that they are ready to start marching( already) round the UK live circuit once again. Lyrically, however, set against the backdrop of recent events in East Timor and yet another mass murdering teenage shoo tout in the US,\" There' s no profit in peace, boys, so you must fight some more,\" pro b ably leaves too sour a taste in some people's mouths. One From The Modern is recognised by\nmany as their third album( except those that\nare either extremely early followers or particularly pedantic musical know-it-alls) and it's not half bad. That' s not to say that it's half\ngood, though. There area few utterly unmemorable or is it im memorable? Any way, there area few completely forgettable tracks, with No One At All and Families being notably good examples of album fodder. There' s no immediate impact like the Riverboat Song riff (see TFI Friday) or Hundred\nMile High City (see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) but if you' re looking for something akin to aCr ad dock guitar rush,\nthen the opening of July will easily suffice -surely it's already whirling round the BBC as a new contender for the Goal of the Month signature tune.\nThe rant-driven / Am The News is an obvious single. The gorgeously simple Step\nBy Step is a less obvious choice. Not least\nbecause it maybe mistaken for a New Kids\nOn The Block cover. Jane She Got Excavated\nand/ Won't Get Grazed are understated quality songs. The problem, though, is that I can't spot any' moments'. No major riff exhibition. No emotion filled acoustic ballad anthem. Perhaps these moments will reveal\nthemselves with time. Too often, though, the more we wait the more disappointed we become. And when there's a fair few other options out there - just look across these\npages for examples who wants to wait? Dennis\nIY ou don't know it yet but you've been waiting for this album. You've sampled the\ncheeky absurdity of Pumping On Your\nStereo and experienced the shotgun chorus of\nMoving. And although this should have been a warning shot that something fairly special was to\nfollow, there were other things going on that\ndiverted your attention. Well it's time you got back in the swing of things, so sit up, sharpen\nyour pencil and start taking some notes. Point 1:\nSupergrass have released their third album. Point\n2: It's the best album this year so far.\nIf In It For The Money saw some sort of transition from bum-fluff pop artists to serious musicians, then Supergrass reinforces double-fold the\nfact that this transition is well and truly complete.\nThis is the sound of a band hitting its peak.\nThe singles have been fantastic. What Went\nWrong (In Your Head) will probably join them, as\nthe initial singing of the title line is the one of the\nmost memorable moments of the album. Varied\nand proud, contemplative ( Mama<& Papa) and sometimes slogan ee ring ly silly (Jesus Came From\nOutta Space), Supergrass have created a piece of\nwork that holds itself up with impeccable balance.\nThe kids aren't just alright; they're outstanding!\nDennis\n\n"

Yes, it's the sport pages, and this year you can expect to see the results of Imperial's finest\nclubs churning their way through whatever the mediocre University\nof London teams can throw( or\nkick, hit, pass) at them. Again. The British Universities Sports\nAssociation competition kicks off\non Wednesday13 th October with\nour Men's Fencing looking to defend their BUS A Championship title from the likes of Oxford and Loughborough. Men's Volleyball may go one better this year to clinch the title after reaching the finals last year. In the University of London leagues, Men's Football are looking to do the double again, while the Ladies team are still searching for their first title in\nany competition. Whatever your sport, Felix will bring you the latest results, match reports and team information on Monday mornings, for your lecture time reading pleasure. Match reports (in plain English, on paper, not scrawled illegibly on the back of a beer mat)\nare always welcome on a Wednesday night. We're also looking for eager sports reporters, pundits, statisticians and photographers, so if you fancy yourself as the next John Mot son, Barry Davies, Trevor Brooking or Murray Walker( potential Jimmy Hill's need not apply) and want to experience the\ncombined excitement of live sport\nand an expense account drop into the office or email felix@ ic.a c.uk. United stride away while Hakkinen nudges ahead\nchallengers falter at first of Irvine in race for title\nFootball Formula One\nOh dear. Once again United are going to walk away with everything,\naren't they. What looked like being\na relatively open season a three\nhorse race at the very least - looks\nlike a fairly safe bet already. The Premiership would seem to be in\nserious danger of turning into the\nScottish Premier, with United only\nhaving to turn up to walk away with\nthe silverware, at least until Arsenal can recapture their trademark stinginess and arrogance, Chelsea can learn a little consistency, Leeds\ncan afford a couple of truly world class players or Liverpool can afford\nto buy the other half of the coach ing manual( the section on defence\nwouldn't go amiss).\nAll we can really hope for now is for something nasty to happen to David Beckham, thus putting him out for the rest of the season and sparing us having to hear the words\n\"this is definitely Beckham territory\"\nevery time the opposition concede a free kick in their own half. Mean while they're almost certainly going to be the only British team making any progress in Europe( unless\nBobby Robson's magic reaches new\nheights or Spurs get lucky and Gino la starts showing off). Oh well,\nat least United can't win the Cup this season... Further down the division's, however, there's a much more interesting challenge in progress. I'm talking about the eternal quest to\nachieve the holy grail of League\nFootball. After years of the Third\nDivision effectively blocking any promotion into the League, using\nstadium quality as their justification,\nall the big Conference teams now have grounds that would do the\nLeague proud. Consequently, four\nor five years after first winning the\nConference, Stevenage finally look\nlike they've got a decent chance of\nmoving up into the heady world o \"real football\". The fact that it might\nbe at the expense of Orient just\nmakes it even sweeter...\nAs the 1 9 9 8 / 9 9 season draws to a climax, the scene is set for a dramatic finish to both the Drivers and Constructors competitions. Defending champion, Finn Mika Ha kkinen,31, clinched a vital two\npoints at last weekends European GP in which Damon Hill ended his\ndiss a pointing season in a fitting\nmanner in an accident involving\nJarno Trulli and Rubens Barrichello\non the first corner. The Nu rburgring in Germany made for an exciting, action packed race with a first place jinx striking four times.\nWinner Johnny Herbert took a first\nStewart-Ford GP win after title\nchallengers Heinz Harald Frentzen\nand David Coulthard retired in a race plagued by inclement we a th er. Italian Giancarlo Fisichella spun out having taken first place after Coulthard locked up after\nopting to take his chances in the rain. In a race which saw Ferrari\nperform the worst pit stop of the season, leaving Eddie Irvine languishing just outside a points pos i tion, the retirement of Jaque s Villn eu ve created a new battle\nbetween Irvine and Ha kkinen for6th position - and a much needed championship point. Ha kkinen sprung into action despite racing half-hearted ly for much of the race\nfollowing the strategy mistakes originating from the McClaren engineers. Ha kkinen' s first overtaking attempt saw him run off the track, but a later mistake by Irvine\nas the pressure built up allowed the Finn to take 6th position with\nthree laps to go. With two races togo, Hak k inen now leads the drivers championship by 6 2 pts to Irvine's60 pts, with Heinz Harald Frentzen surely\nout of the running in third on50 pts. The action now moves to Malaysia and Japan with all the potential for an incredibly drama tic finish - it just remains to be seen\nhow vital those two points turn out\nto be.\n\n"

As treasurer of the City & Guilds College Union I work with clubs & societies, assisting them\nwith budgets, claims and unravelling red tape. I have faced the dreaded Union budgeting rounds\nand won.[ translation] The crowning glory of my two\nterms as C&G treasurer was the successful purchase of silly hats for our bar nights.\nI have prepared the finances of the C& GUas a whole. I know how the Union runs from a club\nfinance side as well as the services side.\n[translation] The job title's got the word services in, so I'd better mention them somewhere.\nSecondly, I have been a student at Imperial for\nfive years and a member of several clubs including\nthe Mountaineering Club, Pimlico Connection and the Catholic Society\n[translation] If you have any spare ropes, text\nbooks or crucifixes, please donate them to Ian Clifford c/o the Union Office. We have no money after\nbuying the hats and purchasing sabbatical T shirts.\nI work in the Union Resource Centre, helping\nboth students and union staff - I will be as\napproachable as a sabbatical like Iam as a mem ber of staff. Personal contact and interest is important in establishing a good working relationship.\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare) - Kevin Butcher\nFinally ICU has created a sabbatical responsible\nfor education and welfare. I feel confident in taking on an undefined role and creating a job description - encompassing all aspects of edu cation and welfare.\n[translation] It was very kind of the Union to\nprovide me with a \"job description\" and then for\nthe president to take it away...\nSince coming to Imperial as a postgraduate student I 've been involved in the union: chair of Imperial Queers and S CC treasurer this year.\nBefore Imperial I was involved with clubs of Oxford and Aberystwyth and was a volunteer for\nOxford Nightline. This experience has given me the necessary motivation, listening skills, people skills, approach ability and fair judgement required for D P(E&W).[ translation] Trust me, I'm fluffy enough for\nthis job.\nI have three main aims. Firstly ! intend to\nwork on the welfare committee's job description. This will be in consultation with all the relevant\nUnion and College committees ( Ac com moda tion, welfare, Academic Affairs, Student Develo p ment etc.) the current s a bbs and various college officers (including the Pro-Rector for Educational Quality).\n[translation] Come on, you have to vote for\nme - I know the names of all the College staff\nand everything.\nSecondly I intend to ask as many of the E&Ws a bbs across the country about their role, their\nconcerns and hopes. The first two would be completed before the new academic year.\n[translation] I 'll go on lots of expenses pad \"fact finding\" missions.\nThirdly, starting the new term with this base,\nI will consult as many students as possible. D P(E&W) will work best if as many people as possible are made aware of the education and welfare brief and it the job is tailored to the needs of\nthe students. I would undertake a regular section\n[translation] And we all know how friendly the\nUnion staff are\nNext year I aim to:\n\u2022 Increase communications& training with\ntreasurers\n[translation] You might be able to read the\nfinance manual without falling asleep.\n\u2022 Open up the union to more students\n[translation] Don't know where we're going to\nput them though - we can't afford any more space.\n\u2022 Reform funding, payments and standardise\nsubsidies\n[translation] Coincidently giving more money\nto C&G, Mountaineering, Pimlico Connection,\nCatholic Society...\nin Felix and the C CU papers.\n[translation] I am the only sabbatical actually intending to get something done this year...\nAwareness events (about two per term) will\ncoincide with students experiences (eg accommodation week when students are thinking\nabout housing, a sexual health week to coincide with World AIDS Day, a stress buster to coincide( as close as possible) with exams and a mental\nhealth week. I hope to convince C CU officers\nand the dep reps to ensure that student representation is fair and adequate across all departments. f trans/ afi on] Hopefully the CCU officers and\ndep reps won't be quite as useless as usual... Felix Editor - Dave Roberts\nFelix is the primary source of information for students at Imperial , so it's vital that it presents\nenough material for students to reach their own opinions on key issues - whilst the reporting\nitself remains unbiased.[ translation] Felix is the primary source of\nscandal and manipulative articles at Imperial\nCollege. I will use subliminal messaging to get\nmy views across. Your opinion means nothing.\nTo this end, I 'll introduce regular in-depth\nfeatures on the major student issues - like UL U, fees and College expansion so that everyone has a chance to understand what's really going on. Proper dissemination of information also means proper distribution, so I 'll ensure that\nFelix hits every campus on the same day, and appears on the web every week.\n[translation] Because at Imperial we really\ncare about ULU, fees, and College expansion.\nBollocks more like.\nClubs and societies should have the opportunity to tell everyone what they do. Consequently, I 'll provide space for every club to write\nreviews of events or preview upcoming activity.\nSimilarly, sports coverage needs to be improved, with a dedicated team of reporters\nand photographers to cover matches at H arlington, Cobham and Teddington.[ translation] Look, see/ know the names\nof the sports grounds.\nFinally, both ICU and the Constituent College Unions should be given space to report on their activities and justify themselves - thus ma king our representatives more accountable.[ translation] ICU and CC U's justifying them-selves? I 'll eat my copy first. Please, keep your\nbullshit down to a minimum of 100 words.\nFelix is a club, and like any other at Imperial it must be open to all. As well as increased publicity (especially during Freshers Week) there needs to be more freedom for people to write occasional articles, features or short sto-ries, rather than having to dedicate their lives to the newspaper.[ translation] I love Felix. I'm in the office all\nday, every day and every night. Come in and\nsay hello and write something. Please. I'm desperate\nI 'll also have weekly meetings at St Mary's and Charing Cross, to ensure as wide a range of contributors as possible.[ translation j Because/ need the medics to\nvote for me...RAH RAH TEDDINGTON\nI believe that these changes are necessary to ensure that Felix maintains its role as the news-paper for the students and of the students, and having been involved for the best part of three\nyears - as a writer, reviewer, Advertising Man ager, Film Editor, and now Assistant Editor - I have the ability to put these changes into pra c tice.\n[translations] I write in very, very long sen-ten ces.

    "content": "Felix Felix \u00ab 1 October 1999\nFELIXANATOMY\nWhere Are We?\nOnce again Felix has moved house, this time into a pair of salubrious\nporta cabins situated in the campus' Latin Quarter( otherwise known as just off the road between Sherfield and Prince Consort Road, nestled\nbetween Physics and the liquid Nitrogen tank). We'll be living here for the next twelve months, until the shiny new Union Media Centre is finished in the basements of Beit. Until then, you can expect to find the edi tor (that'll be me) and a ever-changing collection of assorted sub edi tors, writers, general hangers-on and squat ers gathered around the\nplaystation and/ or comp ute rs (depending on the day of the week) at all\nhours of the day and night. Drop by if you're interested in writing and I 'll offer you a coffee, a seat on the sofa and some very suspect advice\nabout what you might like to do. Independence\nUnlike some student newspapers, Felix benefits from guaranteed inde-pen den ce from both College and the Union( despite the fact that a large\npart of our income comes straight from ICU). Consequently, this allows\nreporters and columnists to give honest, unbiased views and explanations of all the big issues - we promote the Union wherever possible, but\nthe interests of the students always have to come first. Similarly, the edi tor isn't directly responsible to the Union President (or indeed any of the\nsabbaticals) so Felix has the ability to stand alone as an independent entity.\nThe Editor\nLuckily for me (and hopefully for the quality of the finished product), Felix\nis run by a full time sabbatical editor. From now until the end of next July\nI'm being paid by the Union in other words you - just to run Felix. So, if you don't think that I'm making a particularly good job of it, or if you\ndisagree with something that I 've printed please get in touch - I need feedback to do this job properly. I can be reached at\neditor.felix@ic.ac.uk, on(020759)48072 or alternatively I'm usually\nin the porta cabins from 9 - 6 Monday to Friday. If you're unhappy with\nmy reply then the next stage is to complain to the Media Group Chair, Chris Jackson( caj7@ ic.a c.uk) who should be able to find a solution.\nWHAT IS FELIX\nYes, of course Felix is the new spa per for students at Imperial, but more importantly it's the new spa per written by the students of Imperial too. It can only function with abroad base of writers,\ndesigners, photographers, reviewers, sub editors and reporters drawn from across the College who pool their collective talents and knowledge to produce a publication to be proud of.\nNEWS\nThink about it, if something' s not reported' in Felix, where else are students going to find out what' s going on on campus? Consequently, it requires the full at ten tion of a crack team of reporters and photographers to keep you up to date with what' s going on in the Union, in the higher echelons of College, and in the local area. Willing volunteers togo undercover and infiltrate the inner workings of S her field are desperately sought. SPORT\nThis year's sports section should be bigger and better than ever.\nWe're looking for a dedicated team of sports reporters and p hot graph ers to enjoy the ex pen ses paid high-life of H arlington, Cobham and Teddington, cove ring as many of IC's major( and minor) fixtures over the coming season as is humanly possible. Interested? Come to the office and ask for Gus. REVIEWS\nEncompassing every style of music, film, theatre, books, video,games( on all formats), art, museums, gigs and clubbing, there\nmust be something for you. Write\na review, get some free stuff - it's a simple equation. In particular,\ngames reviewers are currently in particularly short supply, so drop by or email felix@ ic.a c.uk if\nyou' re interested.\n. _ j FEATURES\nAn esoteric concept at best, features encompasses just about anything you care to name. Been on an amazing holiday that you want to tell the world about? Then why not write about it. Got a burning issue you want to get off\nyour chest and turn into a College wide debate? Then I know a good place to start. Seriously, if there's something you want to write\nabout then just drop by and have a chat' no' isn't in the student\neditor's vocabulary. SCIENCE Despite the fact that this is one of te world's leading Science, Technology and Medicine Institutions,\nrecruiting a team of science writers always seems to be sur pris in gly problematic. Nonetheless, expect to see regular updates on every major movements, particularly those centred around Imperi al, interspersed with the odd panicked re-write of last week's New Scientist cover story. Contributors are very much in\ndemand. COLUMNS Due to a sudden( and very unexpected) spurt of graduation and PhD completion on the part of\nlast year's columnist snow's the time for the more committed and/ or opinionated of you to\noffer your services.

However, it\nseems that the fire in the belly of the youthful\nDeNiro responsible for his intense screen\npresence has dwindled to barely a smolder, as he seems content to phone in performances in\npretty undemanding( and very lucrative) roles\nand scar per with a fat cheque. Why else did he bother with Wag the Dog or Ron/'n? Bobby fans\nwill rejoice, then, as Analyze This features the man in top form albeit in a slightly un ex pec ted role.\nThough his best known performances should be filed under painstaking method realism, he has occasionally strayed into the\nrealm of comedy, notably with the hilarious Midnight Run. His latest film finds him aiming for laughs once again, though trading heavily\non his image as everyone's favourite mafia hard man. He plays Paul Vitti, head of a New York\ncrime family andaman used to inspiring fear in his friends and enemies a like. Not really a nervous introspective candidate for psycho analysis, but when the pressure of outmaneuvering his rival mobsters begins to cause anxiety attacks, he is forced to seek the help of a psychiatrist. The reluctant shrink, Dr Ben So bel( played by an in form Billy Crystal) rapidly has to get used to his new patient's habit of turning up with a bodyguard and a gun rather\nthan an appointment, and very soon his private life is affected. Most notably, his fiancee( Lisa Kudrow, offering up a performance which could probably have been cobbled together\nfrom a selection of Friends episodes) certainly\nisn't too keen on Ben consorting with members of the criminal underworld. Crucially, the on screen pairing of DeNiro and Crystal is a huge success, both expertly\nhandling the one liners along with the development of their unusual doctor/ patient relationship. This is the work of two masters of\ntheir craft hitting top form and bouncing off\neach other - and thus the result is never in\ndoubt. Though the plot looks a little flimsy at\ntimes, the jokes are the sort which make you laugh out loud and isn't that the most effective form of therapy?\nSimon\nI1I Competition\nAnalyze This\nN ew to London?

Basics staff were\ninstructed by their managers not to prompt students for proof of student identity, and to charge VAT if\nID was not volunteered. Basics\nstaff reported to Kevin that this\nchange in procedure resulted in\nmany students paying too much for\ntheir Pizza. Kevin warns students\nthat they will be overcharged in this\nway by many outlets run by both the\nUnion and College unless they\nactively wave their Union card at\nthe person serving them.\nNOVELTY GREENHOUSE\nSir Norman Foster, architect of the\nBMS building had some problems\nwith another of his projects, the\nGerman government building the\nReichstag, completed shortly after\nour own greenhouse.

    "content": "Q| Big Issue Felix . 1 October 1999\nThe Sports Centre\nFor as long as anyone can re mem ber, Imperial College has been trying to construct a new Sports C en tre. Since the farce which led to the\npresent building's current form (lack\nof planning permission for Halls to\nbe built on top only became appa rent after work on the Sports Centre had begun) it has been obvious that\na larger, improved facility would be necessary to fully accommodate the\nneeds of the College community.\nFor starters, running a series of\nsmaller indoor facilities - the swimming pool, Southside Gym, the\nWeights room, the Union Gym etc\nis far less efficient than central ising into one new venue (a situation\nanalogous to the sports ground issue). Consequently, major cost\nsavings and service improvements\ncould be made by building a new unitary sports centre.\nSecondly, there simply isn't enough space at present. Although most clubs and societies can just\nabout squeeze into the existing slots,\nthere's very little potential for a \"Sport for All\" ethos in which any random group of students have a decent chance of finding the facilities they're after. Moreover, the\nnecessity for some clubs to travel a considerable distance just to find a suitable facility is hardly going to do wonders for participation levels.\nOK, that's why it needs to be built - the next question is where...\nSince the mid eighties, a constant stream of proposals, designs\nand planning applications have\nfloated around the College and the\nlocal community, with a variety of\nsites, styles, costs and facilities on offer at one time or another - until\nfinally it seems that we have some thing on the table which has the\npotential to move into practice.\nIndeed, one of the College's most\npowerful arguments is that they have\n- quite generally - tried to fit the\nCentre into every other open( or not\nso open) space on campus. This is,\nquite literally, the last option avail-able...\nThe last major planning attempt\ncame back in 1 9 9 6 . Having had proposals for a combined sports\ncentre and halls development on top of the tennis courts next to Linstead turned down, College realised\nthat the local residents had had enough of IC's trademark concrete\nblock building motif, and would thus\nonly give permission to something\n\"in character\". Consequently, the\ndesigners took a large lateral step\nand proposed sinking the entire\ncentre - complete with a massive\nnine court hall - under Princes Gar dens, possibly linking together the\nexisting swimming pool with the tennis courts (and beyond). Indeed it\nwas believed that the \"Secret Garden\"( Princes Gate Gardens, behind\nWeeks Hall) was initially bought to\nfurther this project. Although such a scheme might now seem very far\netched,it's worth remembering that\nit was drawn up during the infancy\nof lottery funding, when huge piles\nof money were thrown at suspect\nprojects. Consequently, it was to\npossible to fund such a massive\nproject.\nThis plan went to committee late\nin Autumn1996 and, faced with\naround270 objections from local\nresidents - who cited unacceptable\ndisruption during construction and increased traffic when the Centre reo pen ed it was flatly rejected...\nAnd three years and a few other\n(less fully developed) plans down the line, here we are, awaiting the\noutcome of the latest round of plan ning discussions.\nSo what's the downside? Well,\nbuilding a newHall could mean the\nloss of Southside Gym( the\ntimescale would fit in nicely with the\nSouthside redevelopment and financing could, conceptually, be\nfunded by the sale of one of IC's three sports grounds although the\nsenior staff involved all deny a direct\nlink. Anyway, that's a discussion for\nanother day...\n\n"

Well in excess of a hundred local residents have submitted written objections, stating increased noise and traffic and the\nloss of light as their principle objections. Nonetheless, their decision is still far from certain\neither way the planning commit tee has agreed to come on a site\nvisit to get an idea of the project\nfor themselves, before returning to make a final decision on October14 th. Whilst the mixed support which the proposals faced was not entire-Spot the space where you can fit a county standard sports hall... Photo: Ed\nly encouraging, it hasn't dented the optimism of Frank Murray, IC's Sports and Leisure Manager, who has seen a constant stream of proposals ideas and sketches for the\nnew Centre drift across his desk\nover the last few years, before the\ncurrent plan was decided upon. Speaking to Felix, Mr Murray admitted to being \"quietly optimistic\". IC's Director of Estates,\nIan Caldwell, was in similar mind, pointing out that \"In Central London it's impossible to build anything without receiving a stack of\nobjections\". If permission is granted, work\nwill start early next summer on the\nyear long building work which would see a seven court sports hal i( suitable for basketball, badminton, five-a side football, golf,\narchery etc) an8 m by 1 8 m climbing wall,a dedicated aerobics gym, improved changing rooms and weights training facilities and a series of self contained residential flats erected above the current\nSports Centre site.\nWith a decision expected within the next fortnight, we'll keep you posted with all new developments. \u00a336 000 loss to spell end for Summer Balls?\nDAVID ROBERTS\nMassive losses on last June' s Summer Balls could result in the axe falling on these traditional end of year parties.\nA total of \u00a3 3 6 0 0 0 was lost\non the two balls, with the\" official\" ICU Ball notching up a \u00a3 1 4\n0 0 0 debt, and theMed School Union Ball collapsing \u00a3 2 2 0 0 0\ninto the red. Losses on both events were due to ticket sales failing to reach expectations, with\nthe ICU Ball, held at Alexandra Palace on the last day of term, selling only1400 of a projected1900 tickets.\nAs both balls -had full ICU backing, having been organised by Union groups, ICU will now be faced with covering these losses\nfrom it's own balance sheet. Whilst the Med School losses can be recovered from the remains of the old Medical School Union Reserves, finding sufficient cash to pay off the debt on the other ball\nmaybe more problematic. Indeed\nthe Union maybe forced to dip into it's strategic reserves (built up by bar profits and designed to pay for major capital projects) in\norder to cover the loss. This in\nturn will create further problems for those seeking to guarantee the necessary funding for next summer's expansion into the basements of Beit Quad which the money had been earmarked for.\nOne alternative source of income has come to light, how ev er, as it is believed that certain senior members of College staff\nhave offered to use IC to write-off\nthe losses, in order to ensure that\nthe Summer Ball continue s.How ever, one proviso has allegedly been set - that there is only one ball. In other words, there should be no more separate ICS M Balls.\nRumour has it that as a result of this caveat the ICU President, Natasha Newton, has rejected the offer out of hand. Ms Newton is a medical student.\nFo r now, however, the future\nof both Summer Balls would seem to be in some doubt, with the\nmost likely outcome a smaller scale event organised by ICU's Events& Marketing Manager. We'll update you as soon as there\nare any developments. "

    "content": "16 Music Felix \u2022 1 October 1999\n1 [\nLiquid skin's the funky stuff that you can stick\non to your fingers for protection when you\nknow that they're going to get ripped to\nshreds by some brutal and unforgiving guitar\nstrings. It's also an appropriate title to attach to\nthe Gomez sound. While each track is distinctive and different in its own right, there's an\noverall sonic appearance that's hard not to\nnotice. It's this fluidity that is Liquid Skin's strongest selling point.\nFollowing up on Bring it On was never\ngoing to be easy - massive sales and critical\nsuccess based around a very distinctive and idiosyncratic sound is a hard act to follow, especially as the originality naturally seems to vanish\nwhen you move into second album n territory.\nNonetheless, Liquid Skin holds to the same values that made Bring it On a classic, and whilst\nthe outcome might not be on quite the same plane, it's still nice to see that chart success and massive earnings have n't dented Gome's proudly lo-tech sound. The beginning is signalled by Hangover, a mediocre start that isn't disappointing in that it\nserves as a gentle ripple of what's to follow. Revolutionary Kind plods on and builds itself up\nmuch in the same way Whippin' Piccadilly did\non Bring It On, albeit in a less eclectic way. It's certainly one that's easy for audiences to march along to. The first of a few aural waves then\nreaches a peak with the first single off the album and probably the first to be named after your\nprevious album. Or was it the other way\naround? The musical high point is Rosalita, a char ming and addictive acoustic ballad. \"You've lost\nyour patience. I see myself sink in your es tima tion. Just please talk to me. I won't portray\nmyself so pitifully,\" are lines that make more sense and have more relevance to me than\n\" You say it best when you say nothing at all.\" Blue Moon Rising sees the tide go out under\ncover of darkness. Atmospheric and filled with a kind of late night Colombian moodiness, it's seductively attractive. Las Vegas Dealer then\nheralds the band sounding like they're really\nenjoying themselves and I think that this is the\nkey to their appeal. They're like the proverbial bigger brother.\nThe young kid could graduate with honours, land a job with respect and shed-loads of\ndough but whenever there's a party or family\nget-together, it's big brother with his happy existence that everyone seems to like and want to\nhave a chat with. Gomez may not be heavyweight players but they have a warm charisma about them that makes you want to keep on lis-ten ing. You can take Gomez or you can cut\nthem out. You don't have to have a clue of what\nthey're on about. You could dismiss Liquid Skin\nas Bring It On Again. But me,I 'll try anything\ntwice.\nDennis\n\n"

What fol lows is their report of a very successful venture.\nDiarrhoea, altitude, food poisoning, iodine, blizzards, glaciers, big rivers; summer must have arrived and many have found themselves yet again on Expedition. And so it\nwas for the six of us as we set off\ninto Pakistan.\nEverything went well on our departure from London, and Islamabad soon loomed upon us; we realised how much faith we had put in our Tour Agents; we hoped they would be there!\nAt3 amour first move took us\nto a small hotel in Rawalpindi, the\nolder city neighbouring Islamabad. Here our guide recommended we wait till the following morning to catch the forty minute flight up to Skardu, but no!We were far to keen. Wait twenty four hours in one place! Did they think\nwe were mad? Perhaps fat lazy\nAmerican s?No,we were young eager students and certainly weren't going to stand still for a day. Instead we managed to negotiate a bus for immediate departure upon the twenty five\nhour drive at 3 5 centigrade along the Karakoram Highway. I think\nwe were doubly c huffed not to have to pay extra for this success. Twenty eight hours later, and probably as many litres in sweat,\nwe arrived in Skardu. The scenery\nhad been quite fantastic with\nsheer drops of 1 0 0 0 m, to be found only in the greater ranges, and we felt we had got to know the country a little. Still, after fifty\nhours in transit our eager-student\noutlook was flagging, and we were perhaps beginning to join\nthe American camp. Indeed our next hotel was full of exactly the\naforementioned Americans, and we fitted in fine.\nThe trek (which interestingly is\nalways interchangeable for\" adventurous walk\") went well, covering amazingly chaotic ice fields before emerging on to the 'ice highway' of the Biafo Glacier. We had opted to allow plenty of time so as to be able to be able to climb some mountains en-route.\nOur dreams had been of long snow covered ridges that we could ascend, perhaps ice-axe in one hand, to our glory at maybe7,000 m. Instead we found many rock spires and sheer faces that\nperhaps could be climbed by\nBritain's best climbers; we would have to give it a few years. Despite this discovery we were pleased to make several ascents\nup to5882m, claiming one un climbed peak as\" Frisbee Brak k\". Kayaking was a huge success too with two major rivers, the Shyok and the Hus he being paddled and swam in large sections. The water was very fast - perhaps30 mph in places and proved very painful to those who swam. One epic ended in us losing a boat and paddle, though the boat was later recovered and we car ried a spare paddle. Other highlights of the trip\ninvolved scenic toilet sites, almost killing Hicksy (a large falling ice-block grazed his helmet) and the revelation that our staff had been threatened with the sack should our group complain. Surprisingly\nhigh standards followed! My final message from this\nexpedition would be that if you want to do something, DO IT!!\nHad we followed the well meant, pre departure advice from the many 'experts' we spoke to we should not have visited Pakistan\nthis year (Fabrizio's friends had been shot at point blank out there\nlast year), we would certainly not climb anything( Rob had had extensive experience in the area and knew it was all too technical), the porters would surely con us\n(an inevitable aspect of the difficult people in the area) and as for\ncanoes, huh!, don't even bother putting them on the plane( every\nriver will be stoppered to15m and lethal). Of course none of these\nproblems proved too hard to overcome, and with a little deter-mi nation any expedition can happen, and ours did. Many thanks to Cascade Designs for water filters and Therm-a Rests, Dall oz Fall Protection for Troll and Gri vel climbing gear, and Bridge dale2000 for supplying the team with socks. The expedition was approved by Imperial College's Exploration Board, the Dorset Expeditionary Society, and the Young Explorers' Trust of the Royal Geographical Society.\nTo find out how to join a suit-able expedition or lead your own, come along to the Exploration Society' s Introductory talk on Thursday14 October at 1 2 : 3 0 ,\nvenue TBA. Speakers include Prof.\nBob Sh roter from ICs exploration board, and Shane Winsor from the Royal Geographical Society,\nboth giving practical advice on planning and funding your ven ture.

    "content": "18 Film Felix \u2022 1 October 1999\nTake The Commitments and replace soul with ' experimental jazz jungle'( that'show they describe it in the movie, and I can't think of anything more appropriate). Now remove the easygoing Irish settings and genial characters and replace with modern day South East London and a mixed bag of\njunkies, ego maniacs, wasting no hope rs and a smattering of good apples. Finally adjust the level and the style of the comedy to correspond to this new setting. And, hopefully, what you' re left with shouldn't be a millon miles away from the pitch for GMT.\nLike all the best low budget British\nmovies, the cast is packed with unknowns alongside the occasional recognised face which provokes an automatic\" what the hell\nare they doing there\" response. In this case, that response will undoubtedly apply to the musical cameos on show, with Hind a Hicks arriving as the groups vocalist around half\nway through the movie, and Mercury Music Prize winner Talvin Singh putting in as trang ely out of place appearance in the last few minutes. Hardly A list, admittedly, but a clear pointer to the real strength of the movie it's music. Jazz jungle may well not be your thing( is it anybody' s?) but the haunting, al enveloping soundtrack is hard to forget or dismiss easily. Moreover, as the body of the\ncast consists entirely of newcomers you' re allowed to believe that the actors themselves are performing in front of you( indeed that\nmay well be the truth). Consequently, the traditional fairytale ride from obscurity to mas sive live sets and album deals is surprisingly believable and realistic, avoiding the extremely clich ed approach that you automatically expect with movies of this type.\nAnd so to the move itself. Half a dozen kids from varying South London backgrounds( lone junkie parents, broke but loving par ents, the rich kid, the token black guy...) fi nish school intent on making it big. A few years\nlater we rejoin them, a little older, not much wiser, and not much further through their\ncareers. However, the realisation that life is\ncatching up with them and ultimately at ra gic accident spur them into action, resulting\nin the usual selection of making up, braking up, fights and arguments. And as they slide in\nand out of the protective environment of the group( and the friendships inextricably linked to it) so their lives come together or fall\napart. It's certainly different to most other gritty\nBrit flicks you' ve seen recently, embodying an interesting attempt to revive the musical( given a decent marketing campaign based around the soundtrack album it might just\nwork) yet it's also fairly predictable and generic. The stories might be told in a different way, but they' re still the same stories. The characters weave in and out of each others\nlives in a neatly orchestrated way, yet their\nindividual destinies are never really in doubt. And of course, this being a band movie, there' s only really one possible ending... So what' s left? A very well made movie for sure. The cast probably aren't destined for great things ( musical cameos aside), but the\ndirector certainly has potential. GMT certain ly has the ability to immerse you in a form of music which you probably wouldn't normally go out of your way to listen to and whilst\nthat may ultimately be it's downfall at the boxoffice, it does great credit to the director. Yet\nultimately this just leaves you looking for a great movie to go alongside the soundtrack and, sadly, that's what GMT squarely refuses\nto deliver.\n\n"

Anybody taking over as DP (C&S) who doesn't have a firm background within a sporting club would not have the ability to represent you and your\nUnion appropriately to organisations such as BUS A and UL U.[ translation] Hockey, hockey, ra ra ra.

    "content": "1 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Feature\nWhy don't you get a job? John Simpson, Director of IC's Careers Service, explains why it pays to think ahead when it comes to finding a career.\nWelcome to Imperial College. The next three or four years should be amongst the most interesting and enjoyable in your life, provided you make the most of the opportunities available at College. What follows should give you some ideas for your own self develop ment.\nYou can probably recall one of the significant steps in your life\nwhen you entered the sixth form or went to Sixth Form College. Co ming to College is an even more significant step. You have more freedom, more independence and more opportunities to do your own thing and to succeed or fail. If you do not make some mistakes you will not have learnt anything, learning from one's own mistakes is an important part of experience, but don't waste time reinventing everything - build on the experience of others - take advice( it's usually free) - ignore some of it,\ntest it out, acceptor reject it.\nYou have already demon stra ted some planning ability by pas sing A levels - or their equivalent sufficiently well to beat College. How are you going to plan the next three, four or six years? And I'm not just talking about your\nacademic studies, I'm talking about the start of the rest of your life.\nWhat do you want to achieve this term? Making friends is usual ly high on most people's list.\nHow? Join clubs and societies, attend meetings, take up a new sport, develop a new interest -any of these are likely to bring you into contact with like minded stu-dents. And there's always the bar to prop up while speaking in spira tion.\nBy the end of the summer term\nin your first year you are feeling the financial pressures - in other words, you' re broke! So how about earning some good money in the long vacation. If you leave job hunting until the vacation starts you maybe too late. All the interesting and lucrative jobs have been filled already and you'll be lucky if the local council wants\nsome grass cutting or the local garden centre needs a dirty pair of hands. It's well worthwhile doing some preliminary job hunting between Christmas and Easter.\nCall in at the IC Careers Service\n( room310 Sherfield) where you will find information about Vac ation Training, write to employers with your CV, call into some shops and hotels and see who' s advertising in the local press.\nVacation jobs can be most\ninformative. Ideally they give you the chance to try out some type of wok or future employer in which you are interested. They give you experience in job hunting, letter\nwriting and interviews, as well as a real insight into what it's like to\nwork for a particular type of employer. Some even pay you quite well. Jobs abroad are pop u la rand early applications are essential. Start by visiting the IC\nCareers Service, which has a good range of reference books and addresses. At the start of the second year\nyou raise your sights higher. Now is the time to test your skills in\norganising something a social evening for your department, looking after the finances of a society or the fixtures of your team. That sounds far too much like hard work I hear you say. Yes,\nit does take some effort on your part but, generally speaking, the more effort you put into something the more enjoyment you will get out of it.\nCommittee work is an excel lent preparation for life after College. You learn to set agendas, run meetings, agree actions, persuade other students to do things,\nwork within budgets and end up with a successful event - a party,\na visit, a play or a newspaper just think owe much effort went\ninto producing this edition of Felix.\nYou should start thinking seri-ou sly about your future career before the end of the second year.\nEn if you haven'ta clue what you want to do, that's no excuse for delaying finding out about the\npossibilities. You are surrounded with sources of information friends, family, tutors, careers advisors, libraries and the internet.\nStart looking. It maybe along process, but so is life, so it really is\nworth spending more time thinking about your career than plan ning your next holiday or weekend away.\nThe IC Careers Service is a good starting place. Pop in and speak to the information staff.\nFind out about 'Prospect (HE)',\nour computer driven careers guidance system - and all the in form ation booklets and reference files.\nHave a look at some of the videos, attend some seminars on careers, get yourself sorted out. The Milk round is in the spring term of your final year. This is\nwhen employers visit campuses to interview applicants or invite you to their London Offices. Christmas vacation courses area popular way of finding out about careers\nsuch as marketing but only a few major recruiters run them and they\nare normally many times over subscribed. Stop! I'm only a fresher - why are you telling me this? I'm telling\nyou because you need to start\nplanning your life now, don't just\ndrift through College and emerge with a degree and nothing else.\nOf course a degree is important and should be your first priority,\nbut it mustn't be your only priority.\nIn the meantime, enjoy your self.\n3i9 Bike Ride\n2\n1 February - 2 March 2000\nA journey through\nThailand\nin aid of NCH Action For Children\nCycle 400km in 5 days\nand have the time of your life!\nContact Kevin Terry on:\n0171-704 7019\nfor more details\nA*n ch action\nfor\nchildren\nThai lan^ Q QQ NCH Action For Children is a Registered Charity (No. 215301)\n\n"
