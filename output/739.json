    "content": "\"You Can't Fool 'em\nWhile Nick Raynsford was\ntoasting his victory in the\nrecent Fulham with\nChampagne, the other ten\ncandidates were facing up\nto the fact that after two or\nthree weeks of public\nattention they were\nnobodies again. For the\nConservative and SDP candidates things weren't too bad; they still had the\nodd TV appearance ahead\nof them where they\nattempted to explain their\nparties' poor performances.\nThey had also avoided\nlosing their \u00a3500 deposits.\nEight candidates, though,\nhad lost their deposits.\nIt wouldn't have taken a professional political pundit\nto predict that none of\nthese parties stood a chance of retaining their\ndeposit or winning the seat.\nYet all these people were\nprepared to spend\nsignificant sums of money\nso that they could stand for\nParliament. What made\nthem do it? Some did it for\nthe publicity and some did\nit because they believed\npassionately in a cause.\nJohn Creighton of The\nConnoisseur Wine Party\nran for Parliament as a publicity stunt for the\ncompany he works for,\nConnoisseur Wines of\nFulham. He worked out that\nfor your \u00a3500 deposit you\nget '67,000 first class\nstamps' so that you can\nmail every voter in Fulham.\nThe company had just\nopened a warehouse selling\nwines in bulk to the public\nso entering a candidate in\nthe election seemed an\neasy way of contacting all\nthe local residents to tell\nthem of this new service.\nCompanies are not\nallowed to advertise on\nelection publicity so Mr\nCreighton couldn't mention\nthe warehouse directly. He\ndid, though, use the\ncompany logo with the's' of wines deleted as the\nparty logo. He invited\nconstituents to contact him\nbetween 11am and 6pm( the opening times of\nConnoisseur Wines) at an\naddress that turned out to\nbe the warehouse of\nConnoisseur Wines.\nNobody but an idiot could\nfail to realise that his\nIn Fulha\nThe FELIX Guide To Fringe\nParliamentary Candidates\nelection leaflets were an\nadvert for a wine company.\nMr Creighton's campaign was apparently\nsuccessful (although he\nonly polled 127 votes). Not\nonly did he leaflet every\nvoter in Fulham (the cost of\nwhich was \u00a31500 including\nthe deposit) but he also got\na lot of publicity in the\ntrade press, something\nthat's important as\nConnoisseur Wines deal\nprimarily with the wine\ntrade rather than the\npublic. He also received\nthree job offers because\nother wine companies were\nso impressed with his\nmarketing strategy.\nIncidentally if you want a case of wine, Connoisseur\nWine are based at 27\nCarnwath Road.\nThe candidature of\npeople like Mr Creighton\ndoes make one wonder if\nthe electoral system should\nbe changed. For \u00a3500 and a small number of\nnominators anyone can\nstand spreading any sort of\nloony philosophy. The\nDowager Lady Jane\nBirdwood of England\nDemands Repatriation was\neasily the most obnoxious\nII\nLisa Duke\nand most loony. Dressed in\nav necked jersey with an\nEngland logo on the breast\nshe looks like everyone's ideal grandmother.\nUnfortunately in\npublications with slogans\nlike 'Racialism Is Patriotism'\nshe demands forced\nrepatriation for everyone\nshe doesn't regard as\nEnglish, whether they have\nbeen born in England or\nnot. She doesn't say if this\nwill mean that Prince\nPhillip (a Greek) will be\nsent back. Lady Birdwood\nhas to work harder tham\nmost of the other\ncandidates involved in the\nby-election because the\nPost Office refuse to\nhandle her racist\npublications.\nThe most worrying thing\nabout Lady Birdwood's campaign was the fact that\nshe came fourth with 226\nvotes.\nIn addition to the\ncandidates promoting\nracism and the candidates\npromoting private\ncompanies, the other class\nof candidate who appear to\nwaste the electorate's time\nand patience are the 'joke'\ncandidates. At Fulham Liza\nDuke ran for the Captain\nRainbow Universal Abolish\nParliament Party and Lord\nSutch ran for (surprise,\nsurprise) the official\nMonster Raving Looney\nParty. Ms Duke and Mr\nLord David Sutch formed a last-minute alliance. As a result the glamourous Ms\nDuke complete with skin\ntight green trousers\n(designed to grab the votes\nher policies couldn't) was\nseen pounding the streets\nof Fulham telling people to\nvote for Lord Sutch. Her\ncampaign slogan 'You\nCan't Fool 'Em in Fulham'\nwas proved true when she\npolled an amazing 37 votes\nand Lord Sutch managed\nan amazing 134 votes.\nMs Duke invested an\namazing amount of money\nin her campaign. Campaign\nworkers were situated\nthroughout Fulham\nhanding out glossy full\ncolour leaflets advocating\nsuch loony policies as\nreplacing Parliament with\nhome computers on which\neveryone would vote on\n10 Friday 9 May FELIX\n\n"

Call into Student\nServices.\nSouth Africa\nBlues\nDear Hugh,\nCongratulations to John\nMartin for coining the\nphrase 'ethnic socialism' to\ndescribe the apartheid\nsystem (FELIX 738). The\nSouth African government\nhas been trying for years to\nconjure up an innocent-sounding description for a system that denies black\nSouth Africans all political\nrights and power. Their\norganisations are outlawed,\ntheir protests brutally\nsuppressed and their\nleaders are imprisoned,\ntortured and occasionally\nmurdered by the security\nforces. I think that a more\naccurate description of a system, whose military and\npolice drive around the\ntownships in unmarked\nlorries and shoot dead\nstone throwing kids, would\nbe 'a crime against\nhumanity', as described by\nthe UN.\nAs to Mr Martin's charge\nthat the ANC is a violent,\nMarxist terrorist\norganisation, how would he\ndescribe a regime that has\nlaunched countless military\nattacks against its\nneighbours (Lesotho,\nSwaziland, Zimbabwe,\nBotswana, Angola and\nMozambique), not to\nmention its illegal\noccupation by 100000\ntroops in Namibia. The\nANC is an organisation\nwhose constitution is based\non the Freedom Charter of\nSouth Africa. The\ndocument states that South\nAfrica belongs to the will of\nthe people, black and white\ntogether, equals,\ncountrymen and brothers.\nSurely Mr Martin, as a guardian of democracy,\naccepts that democracy\nshould be based on the will\nof the majority of the\npeople and not just on the\nfew who are 'privileged'\nenough to be born with a white skin!\nFinally, since we are in\nthe season of brain-teasing\nquestions, could Mr Martin\nanswer these few?\n1) Which bank is the only\nBritish high street bank\nwith a major stake in South\nAfrica, controlling 30% of\nall banking there?\n2) Which bank in South\nAfrica has assets in South\nAfrica that come to a staggering \u00a36 billion,\nincluding \u00a3145 million in\ngovernment securities?\n3) Which bank takes part in\nmassive loans to the South\nAfrican government and its\nstate corporations?\n4) Which bank purchased\n\u00a36 million of Government\nDefence bonds in South\nAfrica in 1976, but was\nforced to sell them a year\nlater after a massive\ninternational outcry?\n5) The director of which\nbank was a member of the\nSouth African Defence\nAdvisory Board, which\nadvised the armed forces\non arms procurement, until\nit was disbanded in 1982?\n6) Which bank operates\nbranches in Namibia, on\nSouth African army bases\nand regularly advertises in\nSouth African Defence\nForce magazine?\n7) Which bank has helped\nfinance arms sales to South\nAfrica (although the bank\nsays unknowingly), despite\nan international arms\nembargo?\n8) Which bank plays a key\nrole in channelling profits\nfrom Namibia to South\nAfrica?\n9) Which bank sacked a black employee after he\nhad put up a poster\ncommemorating the dead\nof the 1960 Sharpville\nmassacre in which 69\nunarmed blacks were shot\ndead (the majority, in the\nback!)?\n10) Which bank insists that\nits continued presence in\nsouthern Africa is a liberal ising influence on the\napartheid regime, and is\nbeneficial to the black\ncommunity, although it has\nbeen named by the UN as\none of the multi-nationals\nmaking a 'substantial\ncontribution to apartheid'?\n11) Need I go on....?\nYes, Mr Martin, BARCLAYS National.\nI think IC students\nshould be discouraged\nfrom opening accounts\nwith a bank that is\nfinancially supporting a country whose constitution\nis based on a system of\ninstitutional is ed racism. For\nthis reason, a motion\ncalling on the Union to\ncease printing adverts has\nbeen submitted (again) for\ndiscussion at the AGM. I hope you will come and\nsupport the motion.\nYours etc.\nHugh Rubin\nMech Eng 2\nFriday 9 May FELIX\n\n"

Both\ncandidates ran in Fulham in\nan attempt to boost their\nrather unsuccessful\nshowbiz careers. Ms Duke's main claim to fame seems\nto be that she appeared on\na Pepsi ad or another\nequally boring and trite ad.\nLord Sutch's music career\nhad also been very\nunsuccessful and he was to\nbe seen gigging at various\nFulham pubs during the\ncampaign.\nThe saddest type of\ncandidate are the genuine\ncandidates who have a serious message for the\nelectorate but haven't got a hope in hell of beating the\nmassive publicity machines\nof the three main parties. (I mean who wouldn't vote for\na party like the SDP who\nwere touring Fulham with a van playing Boney M's greatest hits). Boyd Black\nof The Democratic Rights\nfor Northern Ireland Party\nwas running in an attempt\nto persuade the main\npolitical parties to\ncampaign in Northern\nIreland. He argues that the\nBritish Government will\nalways be Labour,\nConservative and Alliance.\nAs these parties do not\ncampaign or nominate\ncandidates in Northern\nIreland, the Northern Irish\npeople cannot vote for their\ngovernment. Mr Black is\nintelligent and articulate.\nHe admitted that he didn't ever think he would get\nelected, he was trying to\nget some publicity for his\ncause, he said. This he did\nwith well-attended public\nmeetings. He also got a message of support for his\ncampaign from the winning\ncandidate.\nReginald Simmerson (All\nParty Common Market\nGroup) was a former\nConservative councillor.\nWhen he spoke to FELIX he\nsounded like some ancient\ncountry squire as he said\n'you have to face facts, the\nfrogs don't like us. The\nnorthern Europeans are\nalright but frogs just don't like us'. Mr Simmerson\nbelieves that Britain must\nleave the Common Market\nas France and Italy take\nadvantage of Britain's membership. He quotes\nbattles where we beat the\nFrench which he feels left\nSome of the estimated half million pieces of election publicity\npromising everything from retirement at 30 to compulsory\nrepatriation.\nthe French hating us and\nprepared to take advantage\nof us.\nThe Humanist Party, who\nfielded Jon Swinden as\ntheir candidate, are a new\nparty. Their policies are all\nabout devolving power to\nthe grass roots. They rely\non Gestetnered publicity to\nget across their message of\nincreased participation by\nyouth in government.\nDespite having a very\ncredible message that\nshould have appealed to\nstudents etc, they hardly\npolled any votes because\nthey only budgeted \u00a3750\nfor the campaign (which\nincluded \u00a3500 lost deposit).\nThe final serious fringe\ncandidate was Geoffrey\nRalph (Fellowship Party)\nwho is a superintendent\nminister of the\nHammersmith and Fulham\nMethodist circuit.\nUnfortunately he was never\nin when FELIX phoned (it's Lord Sutch: In bed when FEUX tried to contact him.\nlikely that it was because\nhe was campaigning\nbecause nobody seemed to\nsee him during the\ncampaign) so I haven'ta clue what his policies are\nbut he was described by\nanother candidate as\nfeeling strongly about\nthings but being totally ay incapable of\ncommunicating his ideas.\nThese serious candidates j tk all seem rather sad about * \u2122\nthe fact they didn't stand a chance of winning. Several\nof them said that they\nmight not stand again\nbecause they'd had enough\nof wasting money on a lost\ncause. This seemed rather\na shame as they do give\nthe voters another choice.\nAs some of them have\nstood in over ten by-elections I'm sure they'll\nkeep going though.\nShould fringe candidates\n(loonies and all) be allowed\nto stand? Most of the\nvoters of Fulham couldn't care less. They seemed to\nignore all the fringe\ncandidates. Those who\nFELIX asked said they\nthought that fringe\ncandidates were a waste of\ntime. One of them\nexpressed surprise, though,\nthat he had seen Lord\nSutch campaigning and\nlooking very concerned\nabout a shopkeeper's problems, (incidentally\nwhen FELIX tried to\ncontact Lord Sutch he was\nunavailable for comment as\nhe was in bed. John\nCreighton told FELIX that\nhe thought it was a total\nmiscarriage of democracy\nthat he could run for\nParliament to promote his\ncompany. \"If other\ncompanies follow my\nexample,\" he said, \"I can\nsee the government\noutlawing this\". It's difficult\nto see how the government\ncould do this, though,\nwithout banning all\ncommercial support of\npolitical parties, something\nthe present Conservative\nGovernment would\nobviously be reluctant to\ndo. The other fringe\ncandidates obviously feel\nthey are exercising their\ndemocratic right. Indeed\nsome like Lady Birdwood\nfeel they have a duty to 'the\nyoung of the country' to\nwarn them before it's too\nlate. The person who\nprobably really wished that\nfringe candidates were\nbanned was probably the\nHead Postmaster/mistress\nwho had to deal with the\nestimated half mill lion pieces of election mail\nmailed for free by the\nfringe candidates.\nFELIX Friday 9 May 11\n\n"

    "content": "Two other detectives well\nworth mentioning are Gervase\nFen and Father Brown. Father\nBrown by G K Chesterton walks\ninto mysteries like I walk in to\nlam posts, and has one of the\nbest understandings of\ncharacters and uncluttered\nlogical minds that I 've read of. In\nThe Wisdom of Father Brown-we\nmeet a mystery brother the\ncustodian of the family Roman\ncoin collection, and the\nenigmatic blackmailer with a wax nose who exhorts money\nfrom his sister for the theft of a coin. There is also a weird sun-worshiping cult,\nwhose chief\ntemple is in an\noffice block, and\na Cornish family\nwith a legend\nthat their wooden\nhome will\nburn to the ground,]\nhaving been\ncursed by a prisoner from the,\nSpanish Armada.\nGervase Fen is almost the\ncomplete antithesis of Father\nBrown; a Cambridge Don who\nloves the limelight, fast cars and\npranks.

A bit superficial\nbut all Chrispin's works are very\ncharming with plenty of oddball\ncharacters, such as the retired\nmajor of cavalry in Glimpses of\nthe Moon who dreads riding a horse because of the statistical\nprobability that he will fall off. In\nthis, later, novel a vicious pervert\nwho tortures animals to death\n(suffocating puppies in plastic\nbags and snipping up kittens\nwith scissors) is found\ndiss membered and his head\npropped up staring at the local\nbattery-hen owner while she eats\nbreakfast.

Of\nthe 619 patients who\ncompleted a recent test,\n26% rated their hair growth\nas moderate after four\nmonths. After eight months\nthe figure rose to 36%, and\nafter a year it was 40%, by\nwhich time 8% described\ntheir hair growth as 'dense'.\nThe scientists running\nthe study said that 76% of\npatients had grown non-vel lus( normal) hair after 12\nmonths. The study also\nshowed that 65% of\npatients enjoyed a reduction in the size of\ntheir bald patch.\nMuch the commonest\nkind of baldness arises not\nfrom shedding hair, but\nfrom a change in its\ncharacter. In baldness, the\nadult hair follicles regress\nand instead of producing\nnormal hair produce vel lus or baby hair, which gives\nbald heads a velvety look.\nUntil now it has been\nthought that the changes is\nirreversible.\nUpjohn has filed an\napplication with the FDA\nfor approval of the\nbaldness cure, and is\nalready constructing plants\nin Michigan and Belguim to\nproduce the drug when\napproved.\nThe cure may be of\nconsiderable interest to a certain ex-president of\nImperial College Union\n(namely SD Goulder Esq)\nand a certain SCAB chairman (namely N Shackley Esq).\nBlack Hole Discovered\nAstronomers have\nrecently come up with the\nmost likely black hole\ncandidate yet.

The\namplitude found was 457\nkm/s, very large for a binary with such a short\nperiod (only 8 hours). This\nmeans that the dense\nobject must be at least 3.2\ntimes as massive as the\nsun. This is above the\nmaximum possible mass for\na neutron star: the object\nmust be a black hole. Or so\nthe theory goes.\nIt is no use the sceptical\narguing that A0620-00\nmight be a triple, rather\nthan a binary, by the way.\nThis argument does not\nhold up given the small size\nof the system implied by\nthe short 8-hour period.\nFriday 9 May FELIX\n\n"

The\n'dealer' had four dice in\nfront of him. They were'nt\nnormal dice though, since\nthey did'nt have each of the\nnumbers from 1-6 on.\nInstead each dice had a different arrangement of\nnumbers, with some\nnumbers repeated on\ndifferent faces and no two\ndice being alike. This\nmeant that some of the\ndice had a greater than half\nprobability of throwing\nhigher than some of others.\nIn the game the player\nwould stake as much\nmoney as he liked, the\ndealer and the player would\nthen choose a dice, and\nwhoever threw higher\nwould win.

I tried\npicking the dice that the\ndealer had last thrown and\nstill, even though I sometimes won, on the\naverage I lost.

This was a recurring theme with the\nTHEATRE Shirley by Andrea Dunbar-Theatre Upstairs. Royal\nCourt until 24th May\nmajority of the characters\nobsessed with the\nprocess of procreation, a notion summed up by\nShirley'sT shirt which had\na picture of two tortoises\neyeing each other up\nsummarised when he\ncomments that: 'It's all that\nI'm good at'.

The\nintensity of the passion\ncontained in these letters\nleads her to try and find the\npassion that has been\nmissing in her previous\nrelationships, with the\nmarried photographer,\nOliver Andrews, James\nKeach. The film is unusual\nbecause it shows the\nrelationship from the point\nof view of the 'other'\nwoman and all the trials\nthis causes, knowing that\nher lover sleeps with\nanother woman every night,\nnot knowing when he'll be\nfree to see her. This point\nof view necessitates that\nthe character of the wife is\npoorly sketched and it is to\nthe credit of the acting that\nthe pain of discovery, that\nthe wife feels when she\nfinds out, is very real and\none of the few moments in\nthe film that actually\nconveys the passion that\nthe film ought to. In spite\nof the excellent and very\nnaturalistic script the\nintensity of the relations hi is never really conveyed\nconvincingly and as a result some of the\nbehaviour resulting from\nthis passion comes as\nsurprising.\nIt is a sad film, the\nbitterness that her father\nhas felt since his discovery\nof his wife's activities is\nvery apparent as is the\nshock of Oliver's wife when\nshe discovers the ;\nrelationship.

Anybody is welcome\nto serenade the Embassy with\nSpitting Image's rendition of\n'Never Met a Nice South\nAfrican'.\nMore traditional, if less\ncredible, activities include the\ntheatre with all its bourgeois\nconnotations.

Because\nnow, there seems to be bugger\nall to do.\nThis is fine if all you want\nto do is enthuse over the next\nproblem sheet on 'Advanced\nQuantum Custard Mechanics',\nbut if your idea of fun is\nsomething entirely different it\ncan get really depressing. To\nthis end, this column attempts\nto print all the things perhaps\nyou might like to do but\nhadn't thought of before \u2014\nunfortunately this entirely\ngenerous concept has been\nscuppered by the fact that\nthere's precious little to do in\nthe city this week. However,\nundaunted by this, we try to\nbring you a potted selection\nof ways to avoid revision.\nGiving art exhibitions\npretentious titles for thematic\nshows appears to be the kiss\nof death these days. Two\nremarkable examples of this\nphenomena are Art and Time\nat the Barbican and Falls the\nMeanwhile at the Tate, the\nprolific David Hockney has\nturned his attention to\nCubism, albeit 50 years later\nthan everyone else. Given his\ncurrent mode of progress he\nshould reach Pre-Raphaelitism\nby at least 2018.\nMusically speaking,\nLondon's a pretty quiet place\nuntil Tuesday when the\nChurch, the Waterboys, and\nLes Enfants all decide to play\non the same night. Superior\nAussie band, the Church, go\non at one of the best small\nvenues in the city, namely the\nMarquee. In the meantime,\nthe Waterboys play one of the\nbest bigger venues in the\nshape of the Hammersmith\nPalais.\nFunnily enough even the\nticket prices are the same, at a steady fiver on the door. Les\nEnfants, on the other hand,\nplay at the 100 Club in\nOxford Street for the\nknock down price of \u00a33.\nQuietness even extends to\nthe domain of the political\ndemo this week, with one of\nthe few events of interest\nbeing the non-stop picket of\nSouth Africa House organised\nWar Cabinet, and the other\nwho chose the name Lord\nHaw Haw to broadcast\nGerman propaganda to the\nBritish from Berlin.\n, Where would Capital Ideas\nbe without mentioning films\nto fill a little space, and this\none is going to be no\ndifferent. There's some real\ncrap out there, featuring\namongst other things a musical about a snooker game\nwith a vampire (I kid you\nnot), and a film based on a board game \u2014 fortunately,\nnot The Trivial Pursuit Strikes\nBack or Revenge of the Killer\nMonopolies. But there is\nVagabonde, this week's token\ntrendy French film to pose\naround talking about for the\nnext month if you've nothing\nbetter to do. It plays at the\nMinema and the Renoir\nCinemas \u2014 which are also\nvery good for impressing\nthose who don't know the\ndifference between the words\n'good' and 'pretentious'.\nAnd with that note I leave\nyou to your problem Sheets\nand the remains of your\nlecture notes, because you\nwon't take any notice.\nNobody ever listens to me.\n\n"

This follows an\napproach by the Dean of St\nMary's. The merger, if it\nhappens, is unlikely to occur\nbefore October 1987.\nThe proposed merger was\ndiscussed by both Imperial\nCollege's Board of Studies and\nSt Mary's Academic Board on\nWednesday. Both groups of\nacademics were in favour of the\nmerger.\nProfessor Eric Ash, the\nRector, told FELIX yesterday\nthat he hoped the merger would\ntake place. He said that the\n'academic case for it is very\nstrong'. He added that he hoped\nthat bringing people to Imperial\nwho had direct human concern\nwould improve the social life.\nKeith Lockyer, secretary of St\nMary's said that academics at St\nMary's were excited by the\npossibilities of the merger. They\nthought, he said, that it would\ncreate an institution unique in\nthe United Kingdom.\nUnion President Carl Burgess\nsaid that personally he didn't think it would affect students at\nIC.\nSt Mary's is based in\nPaddington.

He felt that\nacademics were being deter ed by the complicated applications\nprocedure and by the fact that\nthere would be 'few rewards'.\nPr Rector Dr Phelps told\nFELIX that academics were\nalready fully committed with\nprojects.

Most English\npublications can be got\nquite quickly.\nThe Sportshop has a wide range of Helly Hanson\njogging socks.

I doubt that\nMr Keating has managed to\nfully involve the\nconsciousness of an Indian\nmind however and in .\nInspector Ghote draws a line, the plot is similar to\nthe familiar English country\nhouse (the butler did it)\nmysteries.\nIn a family mansion a retired Indian Judge Sir\nAsif is receiving typed\ndeath threats which imply\nhe will be killed for an\nunpopular sentence of\nhanging passed thirty years\nor evi ou sly. The only people\nv ho could have sent the\nnotes are his daughter,\nBegum Rosham,\nharbouring a grudge for\nher father's prevention of\nher marriage, Father Adam\nan unlikely sounding\nsocialist Priest, Amand\nBaba, a saintly Hindu\nn;y stic, and the editor of a( very) provincial\nnewspaper, The Sputnik,\nMr Dhebar. In this sense\nthe book is conventional;\nits real interest lies in the\ntensions it explores\nbetween Raj and Indian,\nMoslem and Hindu,\neducated and uneducated,\nlanded class and aspiring\nmiddle class, and\nlabourers, and men and\nun emancipated women.\nThe book could have gone\nChinese anthologies in the\nHaldane, which contain\nnovels to similar detective\nstories but I have not yet\nseen a Charlie Chan book.\nWell, I hope that's convinced you the\ndetective in fiction is not\ntacky and cheapskate\nunfortunately in fact the\nmodern detective is most\na lot deeper into these, but\nremains rather superficial-but a good try for a W.A.S.P. author.\nThere are not many other\nAsian detectives, a few\nlikely to be hanging round\nseedy hotels trying to get\ngrounds for divorce\nevidence. Alas an ignoble\ndecline of a once noble\nprofession. Sarah Kirk.\n14 Friday 9 May FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The world of the Detective can vary from the terrorists' London of\nthe 80's to gentle south-east villages in the '20s. The one thing they\ntend to have in common is a dead body and one person who can\nfind the murderer before mere mortals have recover d from the\nshock. Novels about 'tec s, dicks, eyes or G wo/men range from the\nwacky and ridiculous to the co gn it at ive and intellectual, with every\nspectrum of humour and tragedy between. Detectives can be\nChicago hard men, poetry writing Police Inspectors, old ladies,\nCatholic priests, Dons, nurses and travelling port and spirits\nsalesmen.\nWhile not being a totally\nAnglo-Saxon tradition, most\nstories are English or American;\nmany of the non-American\nforeign investigators being\ncreated by English or American\nwriters, a pleasant exception\nbeing George Simenon's 'Inspector Maigret'. English\ndetectives are not ica bly more\nsnobbish then American ones;\nDorothy L Sayers bases most of\nher books around a Duke's brother, Sherlock Holmes\ncompared the common police\nforce to 'a herd of buffalos', and\none of the ultimate s in fiction is\nGervase Fen, a Cambridge don.\nThe dissimilarity between\nBritish and American gun laws\nresults in most trans-Atlantic\nmurders being by the bullet,\nwhile the ones back home\ninvolve air guns, plastic bags\npoison tipped blow pipe darts\nfilled hypodermic syringes and\nsaucepans full of cyanide-impregnated wax. Murder is\nwhat everybody wants, of\ncourse, and the more of them,\nand the juicier they are, the\nbetter. Cheating at cards or the\nodd jewel robbery might fill a gap, but as a nation we like\nnothing more than to mentally\nwade into the gore, and\nAmericans even more so.\nThe books themselves vary\nenormously in style, content and\nquality. There are the old\nfavourites - the Sherlock Holmes\nstories, by Sir Arthur Conan\nDoyle, which can be found in\njust about any bookshop. Most\nare imaginative short stories,\nwith Holmes sniffing out clues\nlike a truffle-hound, but always\nurbane, and usually witty, with\nthe faithful Watson at his side as\nthe perfect stooge. The ideas for\nthe plots are ingenious: precious\nsapphires hidden in a goose\ncrop in the Blue Carbuncle\nheiresses being murdered by\nsnakes descending fake\nbell ropes( The Speckled Band)\nIn another story trunks of\nprecious stones and pearls,\nstolen from an Indian Prince\nwere fought over by convicts\nand cannibals and dumped in\nthe mud of the Thames, not to\nmention a one legged sailor, a tugboat chase scene with an\nIndian firing poisoned blow pipe darts at his pursuers, (who had\ntracked him down by covering\nhis wheels of his carriage in\naniseed). And all in the same\ntale, I kid you not.\nAnother couple of old faithfuls\nare The Moonstone and The\nWoman in White by Wilkie\nCollins, which both take the\nform of series of narratives; by\nservants, onlookers, even by the\ncriminals themselves, opening\nup not only the story but the\nwonderfully diverse characters\nas well. The Moonstone centres\naround the theft of a famous\n(and cursed) diamond, which is\nfollowed by three Indian\nBrahmins who seek to return it\nto the forehead of a sacred\nstatue. The stone passes\nthrough a pawnbrokers before\nthe body of the thief is found in\ndisc u is e. The Woman in White is\nmore complex; a question of\nidentity. A young wife is locked\nin her room by her bounty\nhunting husband, an eccentric\nItalian villain, a sane person\nimprisoned in a mad-house and\nthen rescued \u2014 but by then\ninsane herself; all the elements\nmake it seem like ama car bre nightmare, and even though it is\n126 years old the book was not\none that I could put down.\nMore up to date but nowhere\nnear as good are the\nProfessionals books by Ken\nBlake; basically extended and\nboring accounts of the TV\nseries. The hunk y heros dazzled\nme with their clich ed wit-staccato sentences proving that\nwhen only seconds away from\ndeath they can still play to the\ngallery. This tough-guy stuff\nmay push the ratings up but in a book it falls very flat and there is\nno plot, no character\ndevelopment, nothing.\nIt is not i cable, however, how\ngood women murder writers are-all that frustration has to go\nsomewhere. Josephine Tey is\none of the most brilliant crime\nwriters I know of; she gives clear\npersonal portraits, a plot that\nflows nimbly and credible\ncrimes. Brat Farrar is a rather\nincestuous mystery about a family literally brother against\nbrother in pursuit of an\ninherit i ance, with unexpected\nhidden secrets and hatreds\nwhich was on the goggle-box\nlast year. Other good stories\ninclude The Franchise Affair and\nThe Daughter of Time, both of\nthese published by Penguin. The\nsetting for The Daughter of Time\nis very limiting; a hospital bed,\nbut Ms Tey ingeniously uses all\nthe material she can, libraries,\nhistory books, amazing\ncharacters and sheer\nimagination to develop a superb\nwho d unit. Or rather\nwho dunn 'em, the 'em' being the\nPrincess in the Tower. 'Passe' I hear you yell, but when this was\nwritten everyone automatically\ncondemned Richard III - who\ndidn't have a hunch back, by the\nway. The arguments in this book\nare still fresh lively and human,\nand the fifteenth century comes\nso close you can almost smell it.\nRichard is completely\nexonerated and the real villain\nOi shown to be the usurping Henry\nVII. The Franchise Affair\nconcerns two women accused of\nkidnapping and beating a fifteen\nyear old girl, and again Ms Tey\nturns a story with what appears\nto be little material into a gripping and spellbinding book.\nPD James and Dorothy L Sayers are two other women\ncrime writers that I'd class as\nvery distinguished. In The Black\nTower by PD James,\nCommander Adam Dagliesh,\ni Metropolitan Police officer and\npoet, goes to see an old friend,\nFather Baddeley, chaplain at a Dorset home for sufferers of\ndebilitating diseases (such as\nmultiple schl eros is). Adam\narrives to find his friend dead\neleven days previously; not long\nbefore, one of the patients had\nfallen off a cliff top in a wheelchair, and four more\ndeaths are to follow: a smothering, a faked suicide, a shooting and a real suicide, not\nto mention attempted murder by\narson. Wot larks - the story is\ncrisp, even though the fecundity\nof corpses is a bit unbelievable,\nand her other books are just as\ngood: Unnatural Causes, Cover\nHer Face, Shroud for a Nightingale (where a nurse dies\nafter being fed neat\ndisinfectant), An Unsuitable Job\nfor a Woman (introducing\nCordelia Gray, woman\ndetective), Death of an Expert\nWitness and Innocent Blood.\nAn Unsuitable,\nJob For A. Woman!\nIn the Teeth of the Evidence is\na collection of short stories by\nDorothy L Sayers, which are\nprodigiously varied and\ninteresting. For example, one\nstory concerns a dentist whose\nfaked suicide was detected by\nhis using the wrong type of\nfilling paste in the corpse's teeth,\nanother is a puzzle verging on\nthe psychological, as to whether\na writer murdered an actor by\nswitching blood transfusion\nsamples. In this volume Mr\nMontague Egg, travelling\nsalesman for Messrs Plummet\nand Rose, sellers of fine ports\nand wines, is introduced. He\ndiscovers a professor who is not\na weird and batty Prof, as he\nmay seem, but a missing\nfinancier with badly fitting false\nteeth. In many of her other\nbooks Lord Wimsey features\nprom in ant ly, the foppish brother\nof the richest Duke in England\nand a cross between Holmes\nand Bertie Wooster. He even has\na faithful butler.\n\n"
