The world economy is faltering, the climate looks\nset to change beyond recogni-tion, resource depletion may prevent us from taking the strongest\nactions that are needed for a transition to a low-carbon economy...\nand it\u2019s all a bit overwhelming.\nWhat on earth can we possibly\nhope to do about it?\nSo I thought I would share with\nyou some of the things that I am\ndoing to make the transition less\npainful, firstly to show that it is\npossible to do these and still lead\na relatively normal life, andsec-ondly in the hope that you may be\ninspired to take up some of these\npersonal changes yourself.\n1. I don\u2019t fly. I don\u2019t have family abroad and therefore I have\nno need to fly at all. My research\n(climate modelling) does not involve field trips and I can attend\nconferences in the UK and Europe by train. Incidentally, I\u2019m\ngoing cross-country skiing in\nGermany at New Year. Not flying\ndoes not mean giving up your\nholidays, as some hysterical\ncomplainants would have you\nbelieve. But blowing your entire\nyearly global fair share of carbon\nemissions on an unnecessary return flight seems pretty crazy.\n2. I am nearly a vegetarian.\nActually, I\u2019ve been pretty close\nto it for years as I can never be\nbothered to cook meat, and the\nErica Thompson\u2019s top 10 tips for beating green-fatigue!\nrange of vegetarian options is pretty good. I never buy meat, and I\ndon\u2019t eat it except at special events.\nI also recently switched dairy milk\nfor soya milk (avoiding rainforest-destroying brands), and was surprised at how nice it is!\n3. I switched my electricity supplier to one which provides \u201c100%\nrenewable electricity\u201d (greenwash\n- they get paid to do this anyway)\nAND also tears up the \u201crenewable\nobligation certificates\u201d (ROCs) that\nit receives for doing so. This does\nincrease the amount of installe-drenewable supply in the UK.\n4. I went to see my MP (Justine\nGreening, Conservative, Putney)\nabout resource depletion and the\ncoming UK energy crisis. She has\npromised to investigate her party\u2019s\npolicy on oil depletion for me.\n5. I talk about climate change,\nenergy policy and resource depletion at any opportunity (contact me\non e.thompson07@imperial.ac.uk\nif youwant to join the discussion).\n6. I have joined my local Transition Town (Google it).\n7. I have joined my local Friends\nof the Earth group, who campaign\nto the local council to Get Serious\non CO2.\n8. I try to buy local, seasonal\nfruit and vegetables. That doesn\u2019t\nmean going OTT and living on cabbage for the whole winter, it just\nmeans checking labels, not buying\nfresh produce from outside Europe\nand choosing UK stuff whenever\npossible. I recently discovered celeriac, a British vegetable I had never heard of but\ntastes amazing!\n9. I don\u2019t buy things I don\u2019t\nneed. I am on my second\nmobile phone as the first one\nonly lasted six years. I mend\nmy favourite clothes instead\nof chucking them out. I\u2019ll take\nthe tap water over the plastic-bottled fizzy brown sugar water with phosphoric acid any\nday\n10. I think about the future\ncould be like. I will be 65 in\n2050. It\u2019s important to me that\nwe get there safely, and I am\nvoting with my feet what sort\nof future I want to have.\nGreen Week 2009\nS\nince setting up Imperial\u2019s first\nGreen Week in 2006, I have\nseen real highs and lows in\nImperial\u2019s long journey on\nthe road to sustainability. I\ncan\u2019t help feeling as I write this that I\nwould have given up a long time ago if\nit wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019ve noticed a\nstirring, a seismic shift almost, in Imperial\u2019s attitude towards its impact on\nthe environment. I remember sitting in\na Q&A session with the then-Rector,\nRichard Sykes, who assured me he\nwasn\u2019t the bad guy. After all, he \u201cdidn\u2019t\nleave the tap running when he brushed\nhis teeth\u201d. I left the room feeling a mixture of frustration and disappointment,\nHannah Theodorou\nHannah Theodorou knowing that moving the Green agenda forward under his reign would be a\ntall challenge.\nHowever, since then we\u2019ve done\nsome remarkable and encouraging\nthings. This will be Imperial\u2019s 4th\nGreen Week. 1300 of you signed a petition encouraging the Union to introduce a comprehensive environmental\npolicy (which it did in 2007). We\u2019ve\nmarched, we\u2019ve recycled, we\u2019ve cam-paigned, we\u2019ve switched off and above\nall we\u2019ve had fun. We even painted the\nRector green, in way or another.\nI certainly haven\u2019t done it on my\nown- there has been an amazing dedicated group of people who have been\ninstrumental in this change, both from\nthe student body and College staff.\nSoon it\u2019ll be my time to move on from\nImperial, but I can do it happily knowing that we\u2019ve got the ball rolling and\nyou\u2019ll all be taking over the helm. I\nhope many of you will find something\nto take part in during the week and it\u2019ll\ninspire you to put on something even\nbigger and better next year!\nThis year we\u2019ll be focusing on signing up students to the national 10:10\ncampaign (more info on www.1010uk.\norg) so come and visit us in the Sherfield Foyer.\nAfter Green Week, on the 5th of\nDecember we\u2019ll be joining the masses\nmarching in London to call on world\nleaders to take action on Climate\nChange.\nFor more information about this and\nall the other events visit www.imperi-alcollegeunion.org/green\nThis year at Imperial we\u2019re hoping to take the first step towards\na better, happier, healthier fu-ture. If we decide not to, we\nknow what a future with climate\nchange will bring and none\nof us want that. Carbon is the\nproblem and starting to cut our\ncarbon is the first step of the so-lution. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking\neveryone to make a simple 10%\ncut in their carbon over the next\nyear. We\u2019re on board, are you?\nBy signing up to a 10% target\nwe\u2019re not just supporting 10:10\n\u2013 we\u2019re making it happen. In\nour homes, in our workplaces,\nour schools and our hospitals,\nour galleries and football clubs\nand universities, we\u2019ll be backing each other up as we take\nthe first steps on the road to\nbecoming a zero-carbon soci-ety. It\u2019s easy to feel powerless in\nthe face of a huge problem like\nclimate change, but by uniting\neveryone behind immediate,\neffective and achievable action,\n10:10 enables all of us to make\na meaningful difference.\n10:10 is the perfect opportunity to discover what\u2019s possible when we work together\nand we\u2019ll be signing people up\nto 10:10 in the Sherfield Foyer (walkway level) every day\nthroughout Green Week. Come\nalong and sign up!\nSign up to 10:10 this Green Week\nand do your bit to save the planet\nTake a break on Wednesday afternoon\nto have a tour of the Environmental\nSociety\u2019s Wildlife Garden located in\nPrince\u2019s Gate Gardens. We\u2019ll be providing you with all the tools and items\nrequired to pot up your own herbs to\ntake home, or you can even have a go\nat a spot of digging!\nMake your own way there by going\nto Weeks Hall in Prince\u2019s Gardens and\ngoing through the gate to the right of it\n(you\u2019ll need your swipe card for access).\nFollow the path to the next gate which\nleads into Prince\u2019s Gate Gardens. The\nEnvironmental Society\u2019s Wildlife Garden is the fenced-off garden at the back\nand there will be people there to greet\nyou.\nThe Kingsnorth Six made history\nlast year: accused of causing \u00a330,000\nof criminal damage to Kingsnorth\npower station, their defence of \u201clawful excuse\u201dwas accepted by the jury -because they were acting to safeguard\nproperty around the world \u201cin immediate need of protection\u201d from the impacts of climate change, caused in part\nby burning coal.\nInspired by their story internationally acclaimed director, Nick Broomfield has just completed a 20 minute\nfilm celebrating the spirit of direct ac-tion. The film tells the story activists\nwho scaled the 220m chimney at a coal\nfired power station and the landmark\ncase with supporting testimony by the\nworld\u2019s leading climate scientist, Dr\nJames Hansen of NASA.

    "content": "10 felix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nRegardless of my personal view on climate change, James Beal\u2019s article last\nweek really struck a chord with me.\nHeadlines day after day proclaim the\ninevitability of a doomed Earth and\nalmost invite us to take an apathetic\nview on any matter relating to the en-vironment, including climate change.\nIt is evident these gloomy promises of\na deteriorating planet are not having\nthe dramatic effect needed to kickstart\na change in attitudes towards environmental matters. It is all too easy for us\nto detach from the Earth and forget\nhow much we rely on its all-too-finite\nresources. A fresh approach is needed\nin order to change the public view on\nclimate change.\nBy chance, I saw a poster on the underground a few days after reading\nJames\u2019 article, advertising a new exhibition at the Science Museum entitled\n\u2018Prove it!\u2019 The exhibition promised \u201call\nthe evidence you need to believe in climate change\u201d. After visiting the exhibit\nitself, I spoke with Victoria Carroll \u2013\nhead of content for \u2018Prove it!\u2019 \u2013 about\nthe motivation behind creating the ex-hibit, its aims and the idea of adopting\na new approach to convincing the public that climate change is a major issue\nfacing humanity.\n\u2018Prove it!\u2019 was launched on 22nd\nOctober this year with an appearance\nmade by Ed Miliband, the Secretary of\nState for Energy and Climate Change.\nIt\u2019s directed at a target audience of\nadults and children over 16 with the\nfollowing aims, as detailed by Mrs\nCarroll: \u201cto raise awareness of Copenhagen, allow the public to explore the\nscience of climate change, highlight\nthe significance of negotiations in Copenhagen, show different viewpoints\non climate change and give visitors the\nopportunity to explore these views and\nmake up their minds as to where they\nstand in the debate.\u201d\nUpon arrival, I was a bit surprised at\nhow small the exhibit area was given all\nthe press and political attention it had\nreceived. However, I was told this was\ndown to sustainability being a main focus in the design of the exhibit. The Science Museum worked with Ab Rogers\nDesign to use recyclables and a minimal\nquantity of materials in order to achieve\na \u201cbalance between sustainability and\nretaining impact.\u201d Hence why the whole\nexhibit is held up with string!\nI asked about the motivation behind\nthe creation of \u2018Prove it!\u2019. The Science\nMuseum believes that climate change\nis the \u201cmost important issue facing\nhumanity\u201d and they were aware that\na different approach to just bombarding the public with scare stories was\nnecessary. Rather than create a sense\nof helplessness, the exhibit aims to\nengage the public and \u201ccreate a sense\nof optimism about Copenhagen\u201d \u2013 the\nclimate conference set to take place\nthis December. The Museum is positive Copenhagen will act as a turning point in the fight against climate\nchange and is committed to being the\n\u201cnumber one destination for public engagement with climate change.\u201d\nWhen visiting the exhibition, I found\na wealth of information on why we\nneed to act on climate change and the\nimportance of the Copenhagen confer-ence. Opposition and alternative views\non climate change, such as the Gaia\nhypothesis that the Earth is a self-reg-ulating organism, were largely ignored\nby the exhibition. When asked why\nonly arguments for action on climate\nchange had been included in \u2018Prove\nit!\u2019, Mrs Carroll informed me the Science Museum has looked through the\nevidence and is convinced that climate\nchange is \u201creal, happening and caused\nby humans.\u201d The Science Museum sees\nit as their job to convey what they view\nis scientifically-valid information to\ntheir visitors rather than presenting\nother views they do not believe to have\nhosting dwindling populations of el-ephants, rhinos, and the like.\nHuman activities continue to cause\nextinctions. What megafauna remaining in North America and Europe are\nmostly endangered and only special reserves or protections maintain populations of species such as the Red Wolf\nand Iberian Lynx. Many have completely died out in the wild and survive\nonly as small captive populations in\nzoos. These decay in viability the longer they stay in captivity, as sedentary\nlifestyles and inbreeding cause them to\nlose fitness and forget their survival in-stincts. Conservationists know that reintroduction into the wild is essential\nfor the continuation of these species,\nbut suitable sites are lacking: they must\nbe easily monitored, safe from human\ninterference and often be very large.\nTo make the matter worse, a hint at\nreintroduction of predators elicits hysteria from agricultural and safety communities touting risks to livestock and\nhumans. Yet most people agree on a\nresponsibility to repair at least some of\nthe damage we\u2019ve done to ecosystems,\nand many support the preservation of\nbeautiful and iconic creatures like the\npanda and polar bear.\nRewilding may be a solution. The\nterm derives from the practice of re-All over the world, conservationists\nare attempting to resurrect the past.\nAgainst the odds, they are repopulat-ing open spaces with species on the\nverge of extinction, aiming to create\nreserves that resemble the natural\nworld as it was 13,000 years ago. They\ncall it \u201crewilding\u201d.\nSince humans settled the globe,\nhunting and climate change (cyclic ice\nages, not just warming) have pushed\nmost of Europe and America\u2019s large\nanimals to extinction. These \u201cmegafauna\u201d are considered to include anything as big as a human. During the\nPleistocene epoch, early humans lived\nalongside other megafauna, from the\nfamous sabre-toothed cat and woolly\nmammoth to more unusual giant\nsloths, birds and marsupials. That geological age ended 12,000 years ago, and\nthe fossil record holds clues that the\ndecline of megafauna coincided with\nthe rise of humans. Some impressive\nbeasts only recently disappeared, such\nas New Zealand\u2019s massive Moa and the\nlegendary aurochs, both hunted into\noblivion. Yet ironically, it is in humanity\u2019s cradle that most megafauna have\npersisted, with Africa and Asia still\ntraining captive animals to survive in\nthe wild; for instance, Chinese tigers\nare being rewilded successfully in\nSouth Africa for eventual reintroduction to China itself by the Save China\u2019s\nTigers project. In recent years, the concept has been expanded and applied to\nthe wholesale reconstruction of extinct\necosystems, typically those at the end\nof the Pleistocene \u2013 just before humanity\u2019s touch had truly been felt. In 2005,\nJosh Donlan wrote a provocative piece\nin Nature calling for the \u201crewilding of\nNorth America\u201d to hold off the oncoming surge of \u201cpests and weeds\u201d. He\nproposed reintroduction of the large\nvertebrates that previously roamed the\nGreat Plains, such as camels and chee-tahs. Donlan and others suggest that\nhuge \u201cecological history parks\u201d could\nsave dying species, restore America\u2019s\nprairies and benefit poor surrounding\ntowns in one shot.\nBut what of the Pleistocene species\nthat have been extinct for millennia?\nThese can be compensated for by reintroducing existing organisms with\nsimilar ecological roles. For example,\nthe African cheetah could stand in for\nthe vanished American cheetah, and\nelephants may be good substitutes for\nthe mammoths and great mastodons\nthat once trod the prairies.\nSo far however, it\u2019s in Eurasia that\nmost progress has been made. Several\nrewilding reserves have been set up and\nzoologists have been \u201cback breeding\u201d\nanimals to try to replicate their forefa-thers. For example, in the Netherlands\nthere lies an isolated wetland called the\nOostvaardersplassen. In only 40 years\nsince the land was reclaimed from the\nsea, it\u2019s already one of the wildest locations in Europe. It hosts completely independent populations of Heck cattle\nand Konik horses, breeds that resemble the lost wild aurochs and Tarpan\nhorses respectively. Those creatures\nwere ancestors to modern livestock,\nand the new breeds have many of their\ncharacteristics. The Oostvaardersplassen has also attracted habitat-deprived\nbirds like the White-tailed Eagle, and\nmay soon be enriched with wild boars\nand deer from nearby reserves. Similarly, Pleistocene Park near Chersky in\nRussia accommodates the threatened\nYakutian horse and wood bison, with\nplans for the reintroduction of musk\nox and even the great Siberian tiger,\nwhich is presently confined to a tiny\nrange in Russia\u2019s far east.\nRewilding is not without its prob-lems. Like other conservation projects,\nreserves are short on cash and lack\nclear objectives. Conservationists\nmonitoring them are usually too busy\nto carry out studies, which are essential for garnering support from the\nresearch community. And what with\nmost sites still lacking predators, these\necosystems\u2019 true stability is largely\nunknown, making access to funding\ndifficult. Rewilding may be our last\nshot at restoring the world\u2019s untainted\nwildernesses, but such inspiring initiatives are in dire need of greater public\nsupport.\nsuch concrete scientific grounding.\nPart of the exhibit invites visitors to\nsign up online and be \u2018counted in\u2019 or\n\u2018countedout\u2019withregardstothefollowing statement: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the evidence.\nAnd I want the government to prove\nthey\u2019re serious about climate change\nby negotiating a strong, effective, fair\ndeal at Copenhagen.\u201d By the time I\nspoke to Mrs Carroll, 4700 people had\nvoted \u2018count me in\u2019 against 7400 voting\nto be \u2018counted out\u2019. I thought this may\nbe down to the exhibit only containing\ninformation in support of acting on climate change; perhaps visitors thought\nthey were being shown a very biased\nview of the evidence and therefore\nwere mistrusting of it. Or perhaps they\nsimply did not understand the aims of\nthe Copenhagen conference and how\nit may affect them. Mrs Carroll had\nother ideas as to why a worryingly\nlarge number of people had \u2018counted\nout\u2019. \u201c[The poll] suggests a lot of people\nare not convinced climate change is a\npriority ... we see is as our job to reach\nthese people.\u201d The Science Museum is\nplanning more events along a similar\ntheme in an attempt to do this, including a larger exhibit set to open in June\nnext year.\nI\u2019m glad people are being given a\nchance to explore climate change in\nan environment safe from media tales\nof our planet\u2019s impending demise. But\nwith so many still unconvinced that climate change is little more than fuel for\nthe papers on a \u2018slow news\u2019 day, organisations such as the Science Museum\nwill have a major task on their hands\nconvincing their visitors that this is the\nmost desperate issue facing our gen-eration. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s lack of\ntrying.\nAn optimistic approach to tackling climate change\nBrigette Atkins\nBrigette Atkins Science Editor\nEliot Barford\nEliot Barford Science Reporter\n\u2018Rewilding\u2019: is turning back the clock really a solution?\nThe longer a species remains in\ncaptivity, the more difficult it is for\nthem to be \u2018rewilded\u2019\n\u2018Prove it!\u2019 runs until 31st January.

Say hi to Tachyon!\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2009.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nA\nmerican President Barrack Obama was in Beijing and Shanghai this week, as part of his Asian tour encompassing Japan,\nSouth Korea, Singapore and China.\nHe held two hours of talks with his Chinese counterpart Mr. Hu\nJintao, in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People. The two leaders agreed to work\ntogether to tackle some of the world\u2019s problems, including climate change,\nNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear program, and the economy.\nMr. Obama urged a reluctant China to let the yuan rise in value, at a time\nwhen the US dollar is hitting a new low against other currencies. President\nHu emphasized the need to avoid trade protectionism \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to the US\u2019s recent imposition of import tariffs on Chinese tyres and steel\npipes. Both countries agreed that a strong commitment to fighting climate\nchange is necessary at the Copenhagen meeting, which will gather the world\u2019s\nleaders this December in an attempt to tackle the issue.\nEarlier, Mr. Obama was in Shanghai for a question and answer session with\nChinese students. When asked what he thought about China\u2019s Great Firewall\n(i.e. the censuring of media by the central government), Mr. Obama replied\nthat he supported freedom expression everywhere. Ironically, the session was\nonly broadcast in Shanghai.\nChina\nL\nast week, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a health care\nreform bill, the first time in generations that either chamber of Congress has managed to do so.\nThe Affordable Health Care for America Act garnered 220 votes in\nfavour, and 215 votes against. This was a narrow victory for the democrats,\n39 of whom joined the dissenting ranks. A controversial clause limiting subsidized health insurance for abortions was introduced to ensure the support\nof the more conservative representatives. The Act would make it compulsory,\non pain of a fine, for all legal residents to have health insurance, and for all\nbut the smallest firms to provide it for employees or contribute to a federal\nfund. That would extend coverage to around 36m citizens (the exact number\ndepends on how many will opt just to pay the fine) who are now uninsured.\nGovernment subsidies and the creation of a national exchange would make\npremiums more affordable to smaller firms and poorer individuals. Insurance\ncompanies would gain millions of new customers, but they would also face\nnew rules mandating more generous terms.\nA similar bill is now being debated in the Senate. If this too passes, the two\nversions can then be reconciled before being signed into law. Reform is much\nneeded to tackle America\u2019s rising health care costs, which now account for a\nstunning 16% of GDP, and rising.\nUnited States\nI\nmperial\u2019s Harlington Sports\nGround played host to a surprise celebratory gathering on\nThursday 12th when Sir Roy\nAnderson visited to honour and\nthank some special members of staff.\nThese staff members at Harlington\nhave collectively cumulated over 100\nyears of service at the Ground: Mick\nReynolds (Grounds Manager); Phil\nRamsdale (Grounds Supervisor); Keith\nCooper (Assistant Groundsman) and\nAnne Reynolds (Pavillion Supervisor),\nwho is Mick\u2019s wife.\nThey were all presented with \u201cHarlington 100\u201d tankards and enjoyed flutes of\nchampagne as they cast their minds back\nto a particular Rugby season in which\nSir Roy himself took up the sport at\nImperial.\nMick, who is the longest server at the\nGround, told us: \u201cWorking here I see a\nlot of new faces and it\u2019s very nice to see\nsome old faces too; Sir Roy, for instance.\nHis first Rugby season was mine too.\u201d Sir\nRoy added: \u201cMy first visit here was as a\nstudent in 1965, for rugby trials, and it\u2019s\ngreat to be back.\n\u201cFrom my personal experience I know\nsports are a very important part of life\nat the College. We\u2019ve got an excellent\nrecord for sports facilities here and that\u2019s\ndue to our dedicated and experienced\nsports staff\u201d.\nThe Harlington Ground consists of\nten football pitches, three rugby pitches\nand a floodlit hockey Astroturf, amongst\nother training grounds and gym facili-ties.

This dramatic show of opposition against the destruction of Harlington Sports Ground, and also against the\noverall environmental damage caused by\naviation, took place in August 2007.\nFor the moment, it would seem that the\nHeathrow expansion plans have come to\na halt as BAA has decided not to submit\nits planning application for the third runway until after the general election.\nIf the Conservatives were to form the\nnext government, it is very likely that a\nthird runway would not be built at all, as\nthe Conservatives have made their opposition to the Heathrow expansion very\nclear.\nEither way, Conservative or Labour,\nlet us hope that the Harlington Sports\nGround will be the base of many more\ngreen and great university memories to\ncome.\nImperial Medics battle Imperial College at Harlington Sports Ground every year\nJoanna Cai\nJoanna Cai News Reporter\nT\nhe United Nations global food summit was held in Rome, assembling leaders from all over the world.\nThe UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said in his opening\nspeech that the world production will have to increase by 70% to\nsatisfy the demand of 9.1 billion people in 2050, and stressed that meeting\nthis challenge was linked to solving the problems of climate change.

I mean, really? Let\u2019s stop being\nhypocritical and realise that our way\nof life is unsustainable. The planet\ndoes not care if we think green: what matters is\nacting.\nA bit of history - it all starts with Mr Watt and\nhis steam engine. He led the way to the industrial revolution, which increased the production\ncapabilities of countries in an extraordinary way.\nNever before had human beings produced more\ngoods in the same period of time. And never before did we consume so many natural resources.\nThanks to the steam engine and other fantastic inventions, the US and Western Europe got\nvery rich. The world became more polluted, its\nresources were rapidly eaten up and the air got\nhotter. No one really cared. What mattered was\ngetting richer.\nEconomists thought, and many of them still\nthink, that more consumption invariably means\nmore happiness. Governments, who listen to\neconomists more than anybody else, therefore\ntried to increase consumption levels by promoting growth. This makes sense up to a certain level\nof wealth. But in rich countries, is this quest for\nbeing ever more wealthy still making us happier?\nThere is another flaw in most economic mod-els: they are based on the assumption of infinite\ngrowth. However, in a finite world where production is dependent on non-renewable resources,\ncontinuous growth pushes us against the wall.\nThe current model is not sustainable.\nIt\u2019s time to reverse the trend, to think of qualitative and not quantitative growth. But how?\nOver-consumption is destroying our environment so we should consume less. This might not\neven make us less happy. Was my life so much\nworse before I got my new iPod? Was I miserable\nwhen my TV was not LCD?\nLet us not be fooled: efficiency gains and\ncleaner products will not achieve much if total\nproduction always increases. For instance, the\nplanet does not care if the cars we produce are\nmore environmentally friendly, or if the number\nof cars increases faster than efficiency gains. Unfortunately, this is the case right now.\nOur need for more is destroying the world. We\nare putting too much value on things that do not\nnecessarily make us happier. There is a case to\nbe made that the world will be better off and we\nwon\u2019t be less happy if we consume less stuff. At\nthe same time there should be no limit to activities which do not negatively impact the environ-ment, such as web technologies, the arts, culture\nand knowledge of the economy.\nIf we attach more value to non-material activi-ties, this will lead governments and the private\nsector to redirect investments. Investing massively in arts and culture can only make a more\ndiverse, broad minded and richer civilisation.\nSpending more money on education will make\nthe planet smarter and allow us to solve more of\nour problems. This is what sustainability is really\nabout: leaving the planet in a better shape than\nthat we found it in.\nWe have to dematerialise growth. It starts in\nour everyday life, by slowing down in our quest\nfor more and by giving value to non-material\nthings. We could save the world and be happier if\nwe realise, with Gandhi, that \u201cthere is more to life\nthan increasing its speed.\u201d\nBy Lucas Chancel, Jonas Rooze and Romina Castro\nDon\u2019t be fooled by \u201cgreen\u201d growth\nT\nhe term \u201cclimate change\u201d is nonsensi-cal. No one disagrees with the fact\nthat the climate changes. What many\ndoubt is the proposition that human-produced carbon dioxide is having a significantly\nwarming effect on the planet. We call it \u201canthropogenic global warming\u201d (AGW).\nWe all know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas; this has been proven by repeatable\nexperiments. Through this effect, the amount\nof radiation reflected increases as the amount of\ncarbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, thus\nkeeping the planet at a higher temperature.\nCO2 on its own is insignificant in determining the temperature of our planet. Consider that\ncarbon dioxide only comprises a small fraction\nof the greenhouse effect, with almost the entire\nrest of the effect taken up by water vapour, which\nacts in many ways we do not fully understand yet.\nConsider that the greenhouse effect itself is a relatively passive factor in determining the climate\nof the planet, surpassed by the oceans, ocean cur-rents, the Moon, the Sun, orbital variations, and\nother flux from extra-terrestrial sources.\nSo how does the AGW theory manage to make\nsuch big claims about the importance of carbon\ndioxide? Well, what they\u2019ve essentially done is\nspeculate about the dynamics of all sorts of complex and non-linear mechanisms in the climate\nthat work to amplify the small direct warming\neffect from carbon dioxide into a much larger\nindirect effect, and then put it into a computer\nmodel. They then run the computer model, show\nthe Earth blowing up, and present it as proof of\nAGW.\nThere are two bold and glaring problems with\nthis. First of all, computer models are not proof\nof a theory, they are representations of the understanding of the person(s) who built the model.\nTo use computer models as proof is a circular ar-gument. Frankly, it is quite shocking this very\nbasic point is not challenged more often.\nThe second problem is that there is no empirical evidence to support their speculated magnification of the importance of carbon dioxide.\nThere has never been a period in the Earth\u2019s history that shows carbon dioxide levels being important in determining the average temperature\nof the planet. When we find correlations in the\ndata, carbon dioxide levels are trailing temperature changes, suggesting that temperature influences carbon dioxide, not the other way around.\nThere\u2019s no reason to get bogged down in the\nprocesses of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC), catalogue the locations\nof meteorological equipment (they\u2019ve put these\nthings next to air conditioners and parking lots,\nno joke), or laugh at hockey stick graph data algorithms by putting in random phone numbers and\ngetting the same shape. Proponents of AGW are\ntrying to use computer models to prove their the-ory. That\u2019s not how the scientific method works,\nand that\u2019s why I believe we should look at alternative theories to anthropogenic global warming.\nOn the scientific consensus, I have two points\nto make. Firstly, truth in science is determined\nthrough the scientific method, not the democratic method. Secondly, whilst there is near unanimous support for the AGW theory amongst state\nsanctioned scientific organisations- many anonymous (to remove the element of peer pressure),\nsurveys show even divides amongst individual\nscientists on the theory. The main purpose of\nthe claim of consensus is to shut down further\ndiscussion, which is the classic signature of insecurity in an argument.\nSo is AGW a conspiracy theory? The answer,\nwith some clarification, is yes. A conspiracy is\nsimply two or more people collectively organising an illigal or immoral act. All successful conspiracies in history have been the same. The\naverage participant is an unwittingly genuine\nbeliever, and only a few key individuals are being consciously deceptive. Once the snowballs\nget rolling, it rapidly incorporates people who\nbelieve in its moral virtue as well as those who\nare keen to profit from this new direction of human priorities.\nCarbon trading is the most likely \u201csolution\u201d\nthat we will see, and it is a scam. It amounts to a\nglobal wealth redistribution scheme, with skimming operations by various entities all the way\nup and down the system. It works like this; you\nstart with a blank piece of paper. Then, some\nbureaucrat sprinkles \u201ccarbon credits\u201d. He gives\nless to people he wants to steal wealth from, and\nmore to people who are going to receive a fraction of what\u2019s stolen. If you want to engage in\nactivities that produce carbon dioxide (which directly or indirectly means everything under the\nSun) and do not get enough carbon credits from\nthe bureaucrat, you have to go buy some from the\npeople he gave lots to. Meanwhile, the real benefactors of this system get into action. First come\nunscrupulous carbon traders, who are actively\nlobbying for carbon trading. Then, the national\ngovernments take their slice through taxation in\nvarious forms on this trading activity. Finally, the\nWorld Bank takes its cut at 8% of all international\ntrades, effectively creating the taxation foundation (receiving donations from national Governments is a weak basis of power) for increased\nglobal governance. If you think that will make\npolicy implementation more efficient, just recall\nwhat happens when local Government functions\nare transferred to a national body. Then scale up.\nIn conclusion, I do not believe we can say with\ncertainty whether or not carbon dioxide produced by humans is producing significant climate\nchanges. We can, however, still take precau-tions. It is an observable fact that the wealthier\nthe economy, the more capable it is of adapting\nto environmental changes. We should therefore\naim for economic growth as a flexible and comprehensive preparation for any climate problems\nwe might encounter. Sacrificing growth, by focusing on mitigating carbon dioxide emissions at\nthe expense of cheap resources, only to discover\nwe were wrong, would be catastrophic. We need\nour preparation for climate change to cover all\npossibilities.\nBy Edward Townes\nGlobal warming is accused of contributing to increased flooding around the world\nDubious science and worse economics\nFormer grazing pastures: property rights would\nincentivise individuals to steward their land\nv\n\n"

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nF\nunctional art \u2013 that's probably\nhow one would describe the\nexhibition at the National Gallery's Sainsbury Wing, which\ncurrently showcases a thoughtful selection of paintings and polychrome\nsculptures from 17th century Spain.\nOn display are works that were created\nto, and in Spain continue to, aid worship and devotion: many were commissioned by churches, monasteries and\nreligious orders, and most have never\ntravelled beyond the walls of these religious institutions before departing\nfor central London. The short video\nthat is part of the exhibition shows the\nuse of the wooden sculptures of Biblical figures on pasos, large floats used\nin Spanish religious parades that are\nparticularly prominent during Semana\nSanta, or Holy Week (the week leading up to Easter). When these occur\nat night, the flickering candlelight and\nthe swaying pasos breathe life into the\nwooden statues \u2013 the intention is, of\ncourse, to allow observers to connect\nwith the higher power above.\nWhat place, then, does all this have\nin largely secular London? Why has\nthe National Gallery chosen to display\npaintings of saints and sculptures of\nChrist in dimly-lit rooms? In a nut-shell, these sculptures and paintings\nare just as significant in terms of art\nas they are in terms of religion. They\nrepresent a slice of culture and his-tory, but in the past, have only rarely\nbeen viewed from an aesthetic per-spective, despite the fact that some of\nthe most important artists of the time\nwere involved in their creation. As a\nmatter of fact, the very first work one\nsees is a painting, by the famous Diego\nVel\u00e0zquez, of Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s\nin the act of sculpting (1635-36). Monta\u00f1\u00e9s was a popular sculptor in his\nday, and left his mark on Spanish art\nby having a large influence on the next\ngeneration of sculptors.\nIn the same room stands Monta\u00f1\u00e9s\u2019s\nThe Virgin of Immaculate Conception\n(c. 1628), a polychrome sculpture of\nthe Virgin Mary that attempts to realistically depict her as a young 13-year\nold girl, as opposed to a some distant\necclesiastical being. Much of the exhibition shows art that was created\nto revitalise Catholicism in light of\nthe Counter-Reformation, a period of\nCatholic revival triggered by the 16th-century Council of Trent. As such,\nthe artists attempted to follow the\nCatholic Church\u2019s recommendation\nthat religious art be made realistic and\naccessible to the illiterate as opposed\nto being intellectually challenging. It\nis as a result of this that the term \u2018hyper-realism\u2019 arose, and that Monta\u00f1\u00e9s\u2019\nsculpture attempts to literally present\nits subject. The realism becomes more\nprominent as you walk through the ex-hibition. The sculpture of the Head of\nSaint John (c. 1625) by Juan de Mesa\nwas probably based on the head of an\nexecuted criminal, and the trachea,\noesophagus and paraspinal muscles\nare clearly visible despite the bright red\nblood that covers the neck. The torn\nskin and trickling blood on Christ\u2019s\nback in Pedro de Mena\u2019s sculpture Ecce\nHomo (Christ as the Man of Sorrows;\n1673) contributes to a graphic representation of Christ after his flagella-tion. The accuracy in the depiction is\nextraordinary, to the point where the\nribs of the lean torso are visible under the bruised skin. The exhibition\u2019s\ncentrepiece, Dead Christ (1625-30),\nwas sculpted by Greogria Fern\u00e1ndez in\norder to allow the faithful to meditate\non Christ\u2019s death by his almost-naked\ncorpse. In an attempt to shock the\nviewer, Fern\u00e1ndez went all out to make\nthe corpse as realistic as possible: real\nhair is used for the eyelashes and glass\nballs for the eyes; the teeth are made\nfrom ivory and the bark from a tree\nwas painted red to ensure that the congealed blood had a convincing texture.\nThe perverse attention to detail is no\ndoubt gory, but the work commands\nappreciation in an artistic sense, just as\nit would have commanded devotion in\nthe worshipper.\nThe sculptures themselves would\nnormally have been created by two different parties: after the sculptor had\nfinished sculpting the treated wood, a\nspecialist painter would take over to\nbring the work to life. Painting these\nsculptures was a highly-regarded art\nin 17th-century Spain, and there were\nstrict guidelines present for completing\nthe task. These included instructions\non painting the flesh tones and on obtaining realistic lighting perspectives,\nas well as on techniques for decoration and realistic representation. Ecce\nHomo (1621) sculpted by Fern\u00e1ndez\nis a good example of this approach; its\npainter is unknown, but his broad blue\nbrushstrokes give the skin a bruised\nquality, and he has removed the\nsmooth layer from parts the sculpture\nto illustrate the flesh wounds. The frequent practice of painting sculptures\nmeant that actual painting its own\nright often attained sculptural proper-ties, such as in Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s\ndrawing of a Head of a Monk (1620-30), in which the attention to shadow\ngives the monk\u2019s praying face a real\nspatial quality.

Fashion these days is\nseen as disposable, and the recession\nhas only increased the number of trips\nto cheap clothing stores to find bar-gains. With the ice caps melting, wildlife dying out, pollution increasing,\nand the rainforests being cut down,\nclothing seems low down on the list of\nenvironmental priorities, but choosing\nwhat clothes you buy and where you\nbuy them takes hardly any effort and\ncan have a big impact on the lives of\nmany people and animals. After all, the\nclothing companies will produce whatever sells well, and if that happens to\nbe ethically laudable, then that\u2019s what\nwill start being sold. So where should\nyou start?\nFirst of all is the human cost. Many\nstores keep their prices down by using sweatshop labour, often underpaid and using children as part of the\nworkforce in countries where employment legislation is lax or unenforced.\nStores which ensure that their clothes\nare made by properly paid and legal\nworkforces will advertise the fact, and\nconsumer information about clothing\nbrands that fail to follow ethical standards is easy to find from a simple web\nsearch.\nAfter ensuring ethical standards for\nthe clothing makers, then comes the\nproblem of deciding what standards to\napply to the materials that make up the\nclothes. Few of us would buy clothing\nmade from fur, and it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ve\nread this far into this article if you\u2019re\nMake do and mend\nwearing your favourite hat of Sumatran\ntiger fur, but is there much difference\nbetween leather from farmed cattle\nand fur from farmed mink? The leather is sometimes seen as a by-product\nof the meat industry, but a demand is\nstill being created which contributes to\nthe need for farming. If you are going\nto buy clothes made from animal skins,\nat least ensure that they come from\nsustainable, farmed sources. Wools are\na whole different area, as farmed sheep\nneed to be shorn of their wool each\nyear, although vegans object to this\non the grounds that the sheep are still\nbeing farmed and exploited. Some vegans even object to silk, although most\npeople remain unmoved by the fate of\nmoth larvae.\nMany clothes, especially the cheapest ones are made out of man-made\nfibres. Polyester clothing, trainers, and\nmany others, are all made from non-biodegradable oil products. Man-made\nfibres are present in so many clothes\nthat it\u2019s very difficult to avoid them al-together, but you can ensure that they\ndo not make up the bulk of your cloth-ing. Fabrics made from plant fibres\navoid most ethical problems, and cotton and linen are the two main fabrics\nmade from plant fibres. But even here,\nmore pesticides are used on cotton\nthan on any other single crop. Look for\nclothing that is labelled as being made\nfrom organic cotton, which avoids\nthese problems. A range of cellulose\nfabrics made from trees also exist: Rayon, Modal and Viscose are made from\nwood chips that are cooked and spun\ninto silk- or cotton-like fabrics, but this\nthen contributes to deforestation.\nThe most ethically sound materials,\nhowever, are recycled ones. The easiest way to recycle clothing is simply to\ndonate to charity shops, or put your\nunwanted clothes in clothes banks so\nthat the clothing is kept in circulation,\nand not simply thrown away when it\nstill has wear left in it.\nThursday: Green Fair 11am-3pm, Great Hall\nWhile there are pros and cons to the\nmeat industry, there\u2019s no denying that\nmost of us probably eat too much meat.\nWhether you decide to go the full-slog\nand turn vegan, or make the choice to\nonly eat organic, locally-sourced meat\nwe can make a difference to the environment with our eating habits.\nMeat Free Monday is a national campaign to encourage us to cut meat out\nfrom our diet for one day of the week.\nSimply doing this one action will result\nin a significant cut in greenhouse gas\nemissions and is better for your health\ntoo!\nImperial\u2019s Queen\u2019s Tower Room and\nSenior Common Room will be going\nvegetarian for one day in Green Week\nto highlight that meat-free meals can\nbe delicious and nutritious. There will\nalso be free recipe cards for you to try\nyour own hand at some vegetarian\nmeals at home.\nFor more information visit www.\nmeatfreemondays.co.uk\nThere is a growing consensus\namongst medical professionals\nthat Climate Change will be one\nof the biggest threats to global\nhealth. We have already seen\na significant increases in global disasters resulting in catastrophic loss of life.\n50 years ago the health profession mounted a fierce campaign against tobacco smok-ing, despite strong opposition\nfrom the tobacco industry.

The qualifying rounds for the 2010\nfootball World Cup in\nSouth Africa came to an\nend this week, and the stage is now\nset for the biggest sporting event in\nthe world, kicking off next summer.\nThirty-one teams, out of an initial two\nhundred, made it through the qualifi-ers. Even if you couldn\u2019t care less about\nFootball, this is worth a moment\u2019s con-sideration. 200 teams is more than the\nnumber of members of the UN. It is\nprobably even more than the number\nof different nationalities at Imperial\nCollege.\nThe World Cup is one of the most\nuniversal contests there is; something\nthat literally every country or nation\nhas tried to take part in. The UK,\nand England in particular, comes to a\nstandstill for those four summer weeks\nin a world cup year. The dip in employee productivity and the rise in beer\nconsumption are a well-documented\nphenomena.\nThis time round, England easily\nmade their way through qualifying to\nthe finals and (don\u2019t say it too loudly)\nare one of the more fancied teams to\nlift the trophy. Of course, the British\ntradition of the underdog means that\nany England fan will hugely underplay the lads\u2019 chances in South Africa.\nNevertheless, next summer, the entire\nnation will be holding its collective\nbreath. In fact, every single one of the\n32 countries taking part will be holding their breaths. Football manages to\nbring people together in a way that no\nother sport can. I believe it is called the\nbeautiful game for what it can do off\nthe pitch as well as for what happens\non it.\nHaving said that, I now say this:\nThierry Henry is cheating scum. For\nthose who don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking\nabout, French captain Henry came up\nwith the ugliest act of deceit since Maradona\u2019s famed \u2018Hand of God\u2019 to put\nhis team into the finals . By keeping the\nball in play with his hand, NBA-style,\nhe managed to set up the goal that sent\nFrance to the finals, at Ireland\u2019s ex-pense. As a Frenchman, I\u2019m obviously\ndelighted that my country managed\nto qualify but deeply ashamed that it\nhad to be through such a dishonest act.\nAs such, I would like to apologise on\nHenry\u2019s behalf to any Irish people out\nthere. You deserved to go to the World\nCup. In the name of our common hatred for England, forgive us. Oh go on.\nGuinness? Parfait.\nIn any case, thanks to my not-so-distinguished countryman, France\nin particular, and football as a whole\nare going to be closely scrutinised in\nthe run-up to the summer. The ink\nwill flow in newspapers and the lager will flow in endless pub debates.\nIf the players are allowed to get away\nwith cheating at the very highest level,\nwhat message does that send to all the\nyoungsters who just enjoy kicking a\nball about? Hopefully, once the tournament kicks off in June, we\u2019ll let the\nfootball do the talking.\nSouth Africa are the first African\nhosts ever, and they\u2019ve promised a\nmonth of revelry that the whole continent will be able to bask in. Great goals\nwill be scored, legends will be made\nand for a while, people will remember\nwhy the beautiful game is so great.\nUntil all hell breaks loose as England lose the final on a controversial\npenalty.\nControversy at qualifiers\nfelixSport\u2019s Indy Leclercq offers perspective\nWin a pair of premium box tickets to the\nAEGON Masters Tennis Tournament with\ndrinks and sandwiches on 5 December!\nThe hugely popular AEGON Masters, now in its 13th year, is staged at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall from 1-6 December.

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nGeoengineering is seen by some as\na quick and easy way out of global\nwarming, and by others as danger-ous, unpredictable and just another\nexcuse not to cut carbon emissions.\nBut what actually is it? Well, there is\nno generally-accepted definition, but\nanything that can be classed as a large-scale scheme to manipulate the effects\nof global warming would probably fit\nthe bill. There are a variety of ways this\nmanipulation can be done, however\nmost methods can be split into two\ncategories: solar radiation management and greenhouse gas remediation.\nIn other words, reducing the amount\nof sunlight reaching the Earth, or soaking up greenhouse gases from the\natmosphere.\nThe first category includes techniques intended to increase the albedo\n(or reflectivity) of the Earth, for example sending billions of aluminised reflective balloons into the atmosphere,\nor positioning a giant mirror in space\nthat would act as a sunshade between\nthe Sun and the Earth. One of the most\nnoteworthy of these types of proposals is one that aims to inject up to two\nmetric tons of sulphuric aerosols into\nthe atmosphere, which would then act\nas condensation nuclei and influence\nthe micro-physical and optical properties of clouds. This is the idea of Dutch\nProfessor Paul Crutzen, who won the\nNobel Prize for Chemistry in 1995\nwhen he and his colleagues discovered\nthe cause of the hole in the ozone layer.\nMount Pinatubo has already shown\nthat this method would succeed in reducing the average global temperature;\nafter its eruption in 1991, sunlight\nreaching the Earth was reduced by 10%\nand temperatures decreased by 0.5\u00b0C\nIs it all smoke and mirrors?\nI have a theory that, in the comfortable\nWestern world at least, the most universally appreciable painful experience\nis the feeling of \u2018if only I had known\nthen what I know now\u2019. This powerless longing for the ability to change\nthe actions of the past would explain\nwhy we grieve, and why we feel guilt\nof all kinds. And it would also explain\nwhy we feel such a terrible connection\nto the plight of species endangered by\nclimate change. If only we had known\n150 years ago that the comfort afforded by the brave new world would mean\nthe irrevocable loss of creatures great\nand small and, in some cases, whole\necosystems.\nThe natural reaction to realising we\nhave inherited such a dreadful legacy\nof short-sightedness is to immediately\nstop making things even worse. This\nis what informs a lot of environmental\npolicymaking and in cases where our\nactions are the continual driving force,\nfor example carbon emission forcing\nan ever-increased rate of rise of global\ntemperatures, it is absolutely the right\nidea. But helping ease climate change\nat the source is, of course, only half\nthe story of environmentalism. A lion\u2019s\nThe danger of static\nconservationism\ntaining the ecological status quo, with\nspecies that are native encouraged and\nall other deemed invaders and exter-minated, since the effect of that one\ninvader on the ecosystem is impossible\nto predict, in which case it could be\ndevastating. But the climate is chang-ing; no amount of conservation work\nwill stop that fact. And one of the main\nimpacts of this is that species will naturally begin to migrate.\nMost of the creatures of Earth have\nevolved to quite a specific environment and are almost exclusively found\nin this optimal region. But as temperatures and weather patterns shift,\nthis window begins to creep, moving\nslowly across the surface of the planet.\nWhat happens if it crosses into a conservation region? Well, they\u2019re invading species right? I guess they have to\nbe kept out. The native populations\nalso seem to be diminishing; we better\nexterminate all these invaders quickly,\nrestore the balance we\u2019re used to.\nYou can see the problem here; in\nblindly looking to the past for our\nrecord of what species are native to a\nregion, we risk catastrophic collapse in\necological variety across the Western\nworld. The very act of trying to correct the sins of our past would become\na short-sighted failure to rival even\nthose we strive to put right. Conservationism is now beginning to enter\na new era of crisis policy. This is a regime under which it may no longer be\npossible to talk about maintaining the\nspecies of a region but instead considering the global variety and the viability of ecosystems as a whole. An era\nwhen the discussion is not about how\nto keep invading European butterflies\nout of the gardens of Kent, but instead\nfocuses on the logistical challenges of\nallowing migrating creatures to cross\nthe many dividing lines humans have\ndriven across the landscape: railways,\nmotorways, cities, farmland, etc. We\nmust fight the root cause of climate\nchange but at the same time recognise\nthat the change is here and in dealing\nwith it we may, at all levels, have to ask\nsome hard questions.\nInspired by a talk given by Dr. Blake\nSuttle at the Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change entitled \u2018Challenges\nin Predicting Ecological Responses to\nClimate Change\u2019.\nover the globe, staying at their new\nlevel for 3 years on average. However,\nozone destruction also increased substantially and the average precipitation\nworldwide dropped significantly in the\n16 months following the eruption.\nThe second major type of geoengi-neering method involves enhancing\nnatural \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d. Fertilising the\noceans with iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth falls into this catego-ry, as does reforestation. These processes aim to attack the rising levels of\ngreenhouse gases, and hopefully lock\nthem away for years to come.\nThere are plenty of advantages to\ngeoengineering. For instance, a lot of\nthe methods that decrease the amount\nof sunlight hitting the earth would be\nvery cheap to implement - it would\nbe possible to create a new ice age for\naround 0.01% of the USA\u2019s gross domestic product by decreasing global\ntemperatures. Also, the changes resulting from applying geoengineering\nmethods would appear much more\nquickly than any changes arising from\ncutting emissions, suggesting that it\nmay be a good way to buy the Earth\nsome time while we wait to see the results of emissions cuts.\nCriticisms are also easy to come up\nwith. It has been argued that these\ntechniques will only put off the inevi-table, and while doing so risk making\npoliticians and others complacent\nabout emissions cuts. What's more,\nlittle detailed research has been done\ninto some of these methods, so there\nmay be unintended consequences that\nwe know nothing about at present. For\nexample, reducing solar input could\nresult in lowering crop yields, which\nwould cause famine.\nIn an ideal world, to combat global\nwarming we would cut emissions by\nthe 60-80% needed to stabilise the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.\nHowever, from 2001 to 2002 emissions\nactually increased by 2% and this trend\ndoesn\u2019t look set to change much in the\nnear future. Soon, some geoengineer-ing methods may become necessary to\nstop drastic climate heating before it\u2019s\ntoo late.\nKelly Oakes\nKelly Oakes Science Reporter\nChrisSelf\nChrisSelf Science Reporter\nSpraying sea water to create clouds and shield the Earth from sunlight is one of\nmany geoengineering solutions to climate change\nMore exotic butterflies, such as this\nQueen of Spain Fratillary, could soon\nbe common in the UK.\nIt\u2019s becoming commonplace to examine the carbon footprint of everyday\nactivities. We all recognise the importance of reducing carbon emissions.\nAirlines offer carbon offsets, car companies are making hybrids and appliances are becoming more efficient.\nBut what about the indirect emissions\n- those associated with computers,\nclothes or books? What about the hidden emissions of manufactured goods?\nIndustrial production is based on a\nmodel that was invented over a century ago. As you would expect, that\u2019s\nnow outdated. The assumption that industry\u2019s effects on the environment are\nnegligible is definitely obsolete. For\neach product industry makes, there\u2019s\na surplus of polluting by-products\nthat are released into the environ-ment. They come in various forms:\nharmful chemicals, greenhouse gases,\ntoxic gases or even heat. On top of\nthat, the inputs required to make the\ngoods - and the pollutants - are natural\nresources. They are required to power\nthe plant, to be the goods themselves\nand to run the manufacturing line. Irrespective of which perspective you\ntake, the natural environment must be\ndegraded in some form to allow for industrial production. This growing degradation has led to the current state of\nthe environment.\nGlobal warming is probably the most\npertinent issue that exists today. Industry accounts for over a quarter of all\nthe carbon emissions in the UK. And\nthat\u2019s just their direct emissions. They\nalso have indirect emissions associated\nwith each product. Things like transport from the factory, factory heating,\nrunning a shop to sell the product, disposal emissions, etc. At every point in\nthe life of something that wasn\u2019t grown\nin your garden (with some exceptions),\nit will end up increasing the carbon in\nthe atmosphere. The humble American cheeseburger, for example, results\nin 3 kg of equivalent carbon dioxide\nbeing released into the atmosphere,\nalong its journey from cow to mouth.\nIn addition to carbon footprints there\nare ecological footprints. They display\nthe full environmental effects of human\ndamage, illustrating all the dangerous\npollutants that litter our water, ground\nand air. Industry has a huge ecological\nfootprint. Production waste is dumped\ninto rivers and delicate ecosystems.\nFactory workers get sick from the\nchemicals used. Most of the products\nthemselves contain toxic chemicals.\nOne study found antimony, a potential\ncarcinogen, present in polyester shirts.\nAnother found teratogenic compounds,\na potential reason for birth defects,\npresent in computer mice. Another\nfound phthalates, liver carcinogens for\nanimals, present in plastic baby rattles.\nWhy are these chemicals there? Are\nthey necessary? Apparently not. There\nare engineers, designers and scientists\nrevising the composition of products\nand eliminating the toxic chemicals.\nRetailers are starting to source their\nproducts from environmentally responsible companies.\nCarbon emissions too are being re-duced. Many companies are implementing extensive efficiency measures,\ntrying to reduce waste and sourcing\ntheir power from renewables. Some\nhave even built their own renewable\nsupply. Others want to \u2018green\u2019 their\nsuppliers, stores and even customers.\nThis is good \u2013 they are definitely\nsteps in the right direction. But they\nare only \u2018being less bad\u2019. Industry still\nhas a long way to go.\nNick Oakes\nNick Oakes Science Reporter\nManufacturing pollution: The hidden costs\n\u201cEcosystems are in\na continuous state\nof flux.\u201d\nshare of the work done is aimed at\ndealing with the affects of that change,\nwhich even now we are beginning to\nsee.

    "content": "food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nfelix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\nFOOD\nHow bad is meat for the environment?\nFood production is an important\nfactor in global warming and climate\nchange. The claim that meat (espe-cially beef) production is a huge contributor to global warming is certainly\ncredible; industrial meat production\nis responsible for water pollution (due\nto the practice of storing waste in giant lagoons), greenhouse gas production and land degradation, as well as\ndeforestation to grow crops to feed\nlivestock. As a result we are being told\nto go vegetarian to save the planet. In\nfact the UN published a report on livestock and the environment recently,\nwith the conclusion that \u201cThe livestock\nsector emerges as one of the top 2 or\n3 most significant contributors to global warming\u201d. But let us not throw the\nbaby out with the bathwater. The key\nword here is \u201cindustrial\u201d meat produc-tion. While this is certainly unsustainable and damaging, the same is not\ntrue of grass-fed livestock raised in a\ntraditional way. In fact, certain farming methods can actually help reverse\nglobal warming, and it could be that\na conscientious meat eater may have\na more environmentally friendly diet\nthan your average vegetarian.\nGrass-fed vs grain-fed\nMost animals that are raised for food\nsuch as cows and sheep are ruminants\n(grass-eating). However, the practise of\nfeeding these animals vast amounts of\ngrain is widespread. Not only is it inhumane (it throws their digestive system\nout of balance and makes them more\nprone to infection), but it also contributes to global warming in numerous ways.\nOne way is through increased greenhouse gas emissions. For instance,\nmost agriculture related CO2 emissions come from the fuel being burned\nto operate vehicles and equipment,\nand clearing woods for crop growing\nand livestock grazing. Most Brazilian\ndeforestation is for soybean cultiva-tion, with over half of soybean harvest\nbeing controlled by a few international\nagribusiness companies who ship it\nworldwide for animal feed and food\nproducts. However, small traditional\nfarms use little machinery and keep\nthe animals on pasture so have no need\nto buy in vast amounts of grains from\noverseas (if they do feed grains they\nusually grow them themselves so there\nare no emissions and no contribution\nto deforestation).\nMethane, agriculture\u2019s 2nd largest greenhouse gas is 25 times more\ndamaging than carbon dioxide. In industrial farming, most of the methane\ncomes from huge lagoons of liquefied\nmanure. This isn\u2019t a problem in smaller\ntraditional farms where animals deposit manure in pastures. Furthermore, cows produce more methane\nwhen fed a lot of grains which they are\nnot designed to eat. Methane production can also be reduced by rotating\ncattle on fresh pastures frequently.\nOther environmental benefits of livestock grazing include the ability of perennial pastures used for grazing to decrease soil erosion by 80% and improve\nwater quality, as shown in research by\nMinnesota\u2019s Land Stewardship Project.\nEven a report by the United Nations\nconcedes that \u201cThere is growing evidence that both cattle ranching and\npastoralism can have positive impacts\non biodiversity\u201d.\nTraditional farms have numerous\nanimal species co-existing harmoni-ously, which is the natural way of the\nworld. For instance, farming sheep and\ncows on pastures keeps them in better\nshape as sheep can eat weeds that are\ntoxic to cows and vice versa, and they\nalso help cotntrol parasites that affect\none species but not the other. Chickens on farms can follow ruminants and\ntake advantage of the short grass and\ninsect larvae in the ruminant manure,\nleaving behind their own nitrogen rich\ndroppings. Meanwhile pigs can be\nused to turn and aerate compost which\ncan feed the grass. This form of sustainable farming uses resources effi-ciently, and provides highly nutritious\nfood for humans.\nUsing unproductive land\nA key argument is that the grain used\nto feed animals, which in turn feeds\nhumans, would feed more humans if\nit was directly consumed by people.\nIt should be noted that grain-fed animals tend to receive the poor quality\ngrains and by-products unsuitable for\nhumans. Doesn\u2019t it make more sense\nto convert low quality grains to a more\nnutritious product through livestock\nrearing, than to consume them our-selves? The truth is that there is a lot\nof land out there that just isn\u2019t suitable\nfor growing crops, for example moun-tains, deserts, heath and moorland, salt\nmarshes and lakes. Most of this land\ndoes however support grass and other\nplants we can\u2019t utilize directly. Thus the\nland can be used to raise animals which\nconvert the inedible plants into a form\nof food we can eat \u2013 meat. In these areas animal farming is the most efficient\nuse of the land and can even improve\nthe health of it. Even in the UK, arable\nand orchard farming occupies 30%\nReamika Patel weighs up the pros and cons of the meat industry and asks if giving up the steaks and\nhamburgers for good will really be saving the planet\nof total land area, while permanent\nmeadow and pasture (which supports\nanimal rearing) covers 50%. Sheep are\nour major livestock production, reared\nalmost everywhere. Without sheep\nfarming the mountains of Wales and\nScotland and the moorlands of central\nand northern England would become\nlargely unproductive. We\u2019d simply have\nto import more food.\nAnimals and ecosystems\nEven if more land were suitable for\ncrop growing, is the planting of\nmonocrops all that good for the earth?\nThe answer is a resounding no. In fact,\nremoving grazing animals from the\nEarth\u2019s grassland ecosystems causes\nlong term damage to the soil, and certainly contributes to global warming.\nGrazing animals provide fertilizer in\nthe form of nitrogen-rich manure,\nroot stimulation, pest control and decrease soil erosion, thus eliminating\nthe need for artificial fertilizers which\nrely on fossil fuels. Nothing made\nfrom fossil fuels is sustainable. In ad-dition, permanent pastures act as carbon sinks, pushing carbon into the soil\nand building topsoil. The grasses and\nherbs take in carbon from the atmosphere (as carbon dioxide), the animals\neat the plants, which then go back into\nthe soil via the animal\u2019s manure, and\nare trampled back into the soil where\nthe carbon is absorbed and recycled,\nfeeding plant roots and enabling new\nplants to sprout. This form of farming\nmimics the natural evolutionary conditions of the earth thousands of years\nago, where grazers grazed the land\nand fertilized the soil with their waste,\nthen were chased away by predators or\nmoved on, thus allowing new plants to\nregrow. This process is in stark contrast to a conventional corn or soybean\nfield which is actually a major source\nof greenhouse gases. According to\na recent Scientific American article\n\u201cFuture farming: A return to roots?\u201d,\nproduction of high input annual crops\nrelease carbon at a rate of around 1000\npounds per acre, while perennial grasslands can store carbon at roughly the\nsame rate. One analysis published in\nthe journal Global Change Biology\nshowed a 19% increase in soil carbon\nafter the land was changed from cropland to pasture. Factor in the fact that\nanimal grazing also reduces the need\nfor vehicles, machinery, fertilizers and\npesticides, and it\u2019s not difficult to see\nhow raising animals on grass, as opposed to in confinement, can actually\nbenefit the environment.\nWhat can we do?\nThe problem is not as clear cut as\n\u201cmeat is bad for the environment, so\nwe should all go vegetarian to save the\nplanet\u201d . Going veggie may mean importing more food and making us even\nmore dependent on the industrialized\nfood chain, which is dependant on fossil fuels and chemicals. Animals are\nneeded to cycle nutrients and prevent\nareas of land turning to desert. The\nproblem isn\u2019t meat. It\u2019s large industrial corporations and big agribusiness companies. It\u2019s true that as the\nworld population grows, the amount\nof meat eaten will grow. But when\nliving on pastures as they meant to,\nanimal foods are healthy, traditional\nparts of the human diet that we have\nrelied on for most of our evolution.\nIf we want to save the planet and still\nenjoy that hamburger, we should support local, organic farmers who raise\ntheir animals on grass using traditional\nmethods. All the food we buy should\nbe minimally processed, in season and\nlocally grown, and we should not let\nany of it go to waste. In terms of meat\ncomsumption, we should be eating\nmore organ meats \u2013 if we are going to\nkill an animal for food the least we can\ndo is not waste any of it.\nThinking about the issues involved,\nand how much more damaging to the\nenvironment that soy burger could be\n(can anyone say deforestation, pesti-cides, fertilizers, etc..?) we can all make\nour diets more sustainable and eco-friendly, whether we\u2019re vegan, vegetarian or omnivores.\nChris Reynolds casts his eye over the fishing industry\nMost of our earth is covered by ocean, a rolling expanse of waves that seem to\nhold a limitless bounty of fish, forming a staple part of the diet of a huge proportion of people on earth. The worldwide per capita consumption is around 16kg,\nmore than double what it was during the first half of the twentieth century, and\nin Britain, fish and chips have long been one of the most popular dishes. For a\nlong time, the sea has been seen as an infinite resource that can be plundered relentlessly without any consequences, but after years of unsustainable overfish-ing, stocks of many fish are running low. A study in Nature found that 90% of\nthe larger predatory fish such as sharks and marlins have disappeared from the\noceans, and 80% of most of the smaller fish, such as cod and tuna, are gone too,\nand this study was performed six years ago.\nWe\u2019ve already seen the effects of overfishing on the whale population, which\ncrashed back in the 1960s, and scientists are now predicting that supplies of fish\nwill run out by 2048 if we continue fishing at the same rate. With levels of fish\ndropping, fishing methods have become increasingly intensive. Long-line fish-ing, where miles of baited hooks are strung out below the surface of the ocean\nsurface, and trawling, catch fish indiscriminately, killing many unwanted larger\nfish. With catches getting smaller, the trawler nets grow ever wider, and the\nnumber of unwanted larger fish, such as dolphins, getting swept up increases.\nBottom trawling, where the net is allowed to scrape along the ocean floor to\ncatch the cod and halibut that live at the deeper depths, can cause vast damage\nto coral and the sea floor ecosystem.\nThere is a lack of pressure on fishermen to stop overfishing. Fishermen don\u2019t\nwant to start imposing quota limits on themselves and limit their income, and\ngovernments are unwilling to do anything about it; after all, the fish don\u2019t have\nvotes, and there is little public pressure. Overfishing is not an environmental\nproblem uppermost in the mind of most of the public. It\u2019s easy to show people\nimages of vast swathes of cut-down rainforest, or sodden rock replacing snowy\nglaciers, but showing the effects of overfishing are more difficult. The sea looks\nthe same as ever, while the fish stocks dwindle away, invisibly, underneath.\nOverfishing can be very difficult to change. For example, despite all whale-hunting being banned since 1983, many whales are still near the brink of extinc-tion, and large numbers of whales are still killed under the guise of conducting\nscientific research, presumably into the tastiness of whale meat. However, there\nis some good news for whales and fishing bans. Blue whale hunting was banned\nin 1960, when 5000 blue whales were left, and only now, 50 years after the ban\nare the numbers of blue whales starting to grow again in the Antarctic. This gives\nsome hope that attitudes, and the march towards extinction of many fish species\ncan be changed, and you too can help. Try to cut down on the amount of fish you\neat, and if you do eat fish, make sure they are properly farmed from sustainable\nsources, and that damaging fishing methods are not used. The Marine Conservation Society publishes leaflets, available on the internet, which can give you an\neasy guide to which fish are properly farmed, not trawled, and dolphin-friendly.\n\n"

Lord Stern would be proud. My\nreasons were purely environmental:\nanimal welfare never really bothered\nme when you consider the number of\npeople treated inhumanely due to in-dustry; meat in moderation is healthy\nand I know its tasty. I stopped talking\nabout how fishing and meat industries\nwere bad for the environment in many,\nmany ways and removed myself from\nit.\nThe U.N. report Livestock\u2019s Long\nShadow \u2013 Environmental issues and\noptions calculated that livestock is responsible for 18% of global CO2 emis-sions, greater than that of transport.\nFor all the other changes you could\nmake: the light bulbs; the recycling;\neven the electric cars, a greater impact\non the your carbon footprint would be\nachieved by a simple change in diet,\nwith probably a faster, notable saving of money. Not only that there is a\nwhole plethora of other environmental\nimpacts due to the production of meat\nwhich you would be directly reducing.\nCows and sheep burp and fart out inordinate amounts of methane (a more\npotent greenhouse gas than CO2),\ncontributing to 37% of global methane\nemissions. They also produce nitrous\noxide and ammonia on a gargantuan\nscale, both of which are environmentally damaging. There is also the CO2\nthe associated with the meat processing and transporting industry.\nThere are also disproportionate resources required to produce meat.\nThere is the classic example of a kilo\nof beef requiring at least 13,000L of\nwater while a kilo of wheat only requires 2000L. Admittedly there are\nsome much more water hungry plants\nout there, and I would not trust anyone\nadvocating a wheat only diet, they by\nno means take as much water as meat.\nCurrently a sixth of the world\u2019s population do not have access to clean water and agriculture plays a key role in\nthis. As water sources become scarce,\nthose with pumps big enough withdraw water from deeper water tables\nfurther reducing the availability of\nwater. Although all agriculture is water intensive, meat rearing is more so\nby stopping the demand for meat, the\nwater supply could be used more efficiently and the land used for crop cul-tivation. Currently 70% of agricultural\nland is used for farming animals, either\nthrough grazing pastures or got crops\nto feed said animals. The utilisation\nof both rainforest and arid areas for\nanimal production are well known and\nwould not be required if there was the\nconstant demand for meat.\nIt is not just the legged animals we\nshould stop eating: pescetarianism is\nnot all that much better as although\nthis reduces the demand for meat the\nworld\u2019s fish stocks are in a bad place. At\nthe moment two thirds of the world\u2019s\nfish species are either fully exploited\nor depleted. Furthermore, the removal\nof key organisms messes with ecosystems in place. Overfishing can lead to\nsituations where remaining stocks are\nunable to restock the oceans properly\nand the process of by-catch where the\nmajority of what is caught is discarded,\nas waste is highly inefficient. Although\nthere are bound to be improvements\nin aquaculture, this method itself has\nmany issues concerning it. Not least\nthat the reared fish require to feeding,\nand often this is in the form of smaller\nfish that have been trawled from else-where. If you do choose to eat fish this\nis a good guide to what is sustainable:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/MCSPGFG\nMaybe my vegetarianism is a bit\ndramatic, that if people reduced their\nmeat intake at all and therefore had a\ndecrease in the environmental damage\nassociated it would be a big enough\ngesture. Recently the Belgian city of\nGhent became the first city in the\nworld to have a meat free day (Veg-giedag) for civil servant and school\ncanteens citywide, with initiative to\nencourage everyone to have a day a\nweek without meat.\nI\u2019d hope we are all capable of at least\npulling a Ghent, in fact I do not think it\nis much a of a push to half ones weekly\nmeat intake or even attempting to only\neat meat once a week, a Fleishidagg if\nyou will.\nFurther still are meat-avoiders and\ngreen-eaters, which are apparently\nemerging terms for people who on the\nwhole try to avoid meat without prohibiting it altogether, and these are\nthings I feel everyone has the capacity\nto easily achieve as it removes the guilt\nof the occasional lapse and preserves\ntraditions such as Christmas dinner.\nBy reducing their meat consumption\nor assuming a vegetarian diet people\nreduce their environmental impact\nand improve global access to water.\nHumans are perfectly capable of surviving without eating meat everyday.\nReubenGibbonsthinksyoushouldbevegetariantoo\n\u201cCurrently a sixth\nof the world\u2019s\npopulation do\nnot have access to\nclean water and\nagriculture\u201d\nA\npparently I\u2019m supposed\nto talk to you about The\nEnvironment this week.\nThe big E. The G word.\nTo celebrate Green Week\nat Imperial, felix allegedly is going to\nhave an ecological flavour to things\nthis week, printed on five thousand\nnewspapers that will end up blowing\naround South Kensington and dumped\nin wastebins as a nice garnish of irony,\nand so I\u2019ve agreed to go along with the\ncharade under a gigantic wind-pow-ered umbrella of protest. I\u2019m not stupid\nenough to actually criticise the idea of\nconserving resources, of course, but as\nfar as arbitrarily-chosen issue-driven\nperiods of time go, I\u2019m well up for a\nfight.\nBefore we go any further - being\ngreen is a great idea and even if the only\nchange you make is to stop moronically\nshoving everything in the black landfill\nbins when the red and green bins are\nright next to it, like a deranged, feral\ntoddler who can\u2019t be arsed to solve a\nfour-piece jigsaw puzzle, then Green\nWeek will have achieved something.\nAlthough now I\u2019ve just written that\nhere, it\u2019ll actually be me that achieved\nit, but I\u2019m willing to let those guys take\nthe credit for now.\nSo yes, great idea. Clearly, I\u2019m not\nsure it\u2019s best that Imperial hosts a\nweek preaching to students about\nenvironmental friendliness when its\nown buildings have the worst possible\nenergy efficiency rating, proudly on\ndisplay in the Tanaka foyer, but if Imperial stopped doing things that were\nhypocritical then it would pretty much\nhave to shut down altogether. It\u2019s just\nthat even if we assume all other things\nto be equal, having a celebratory week\ncommemorating conserving resources\nis a double-whammy of mental disor-ders. On the one hand, there\u2019s the principle that people actually need a week\nof events, smiles and whooping to understand that they\u2019re needlessly wasting tonnes of material every day, which\nif true is a pretty sad indictment of the\ngeneral populace.\nNot that it\u2019s false, necessarily; I\u2019m\nfairly sure you all get your brain cells\nfrom the same place you get your\ntaste in music. I\u2019m just saying that if\nwe\u2019ve got to the point where we need\nfirst years to \u201cchampion green issues\u201d\nalongside John James, a man whose\nImperial Sabbs blog doesn\u2019t so much\nspeak of a man ready to enthuse people into action over key issues as much\nas it speaks of several reasons why becoming a Sabb is only marginally better than being sentenced to death by\nbuggery. If we\u2019ve got to that point, then\nperhaps we need to think about nuking\nthe site from orbit and starting from\nscratch.\nBut on the other hand from this, the\nidea of having a week bullying staff and\nstudents into switching off televisions\nin the ad breaks, or whatever the message is this year, is entirely futile. People get this stuff shouted at them every\nday, and eventually the scare factor just\nwears off. You can only tell someone\nthey\u2019re drowning half of north-east India by leaving their printer on standby\novernight before they\u2019ll just stop lis-tening. We\u2019re trained to do it, we\u2019re\ntrained to tune out the repetitive patterns and droning in everyday life.\nSo my suggestion is this - instead of\nspending all this money on posters and\nevents and encouraging felix to \u201cwrite\ngreen\u201d, blow the whole budget on simulating what global warming would do\nto Imperial. Pour three hundred gallons of ice cold water in through the\nroof of Sherfield and watch as people\nget blown out of windows and drown\nto death in lifts. Hire a bunch of UV\nlamps and use it to slowly torch people\nto death as they eat their lunch on the\nTanaka steps. I guarantee you, a week\nlater those bottle bins will be overflowing and then we can all give ourselves a\npat on the back.\nAngryGeekreallyrethinksGreenWeek\n\u201cPour three\nhundred gallons of\nice cold water in\nthrough the roof\nof Sherfield and\nwatch... \u201d\n\n"

The first half saw them\nfree to attack at will while in the second period, they were put under much\nmore pressure and found it harder to\nburst forward. In the end they were too\nstrong.\nAfter this, Gabriel\u2019s and Mitchel\u2019s\nplayed the leader-deciding match of\nthe group, with Gabriel\u2019s coming out\non top.\nIt was decided that the winners of\na play-off between Imperial and John\nMitchel\u2019s would play, along with St.\nGabriel\u2019s, in a semi-final against one\nof the losing teams from the Cup\ncompetition.\nSo they took to the field again, and\nmade sure we gave the Intermediate\nchampions a serious challenge.\nFrom the throw-in, Imperial battled well, doggedly defending against\nMitchel\u2019s attacks. Against the run of\nplay however, they managed to forge\na goal out of a number of attempts by\nImperial to clear the ball. This was followed by Keith Laverty, now playing at\ncentre-forward, converting two scores.\nThe score stayed the same until half-time: Imperial 0-2, John Mitchel\u2019s 1-0.\nUnfortunately playing with the wind\nin the first half again meant we would\nalways be vulnerable in the second\nhalf, and Mitchel\u2019s managed to break\nfree to convert a few points.\nSome great saves and long clearances\nfrom the Imperial defence, with rookie\nJamie Sanders showing some great\ncourage, slowed the opposition attack\ndown, and allowed our forwards to\nconvert some more scores.\nAs the final whistle blew, John Mitchel\u2019s came out tops, but not without a\nvery respectable display from Imperial.\nSo that was it for our championships\nthis year. All that was left to do was to\nget very, very pissed on the bus back to\nthe union and support the Irish football team against France in Da Vinci\u2019s.\nThis is not the end of the season for\nImperial\u2019s Hurling squad.\nThe focus now for IC GAA turns\nto Gaelic Football where this Sunday\n(20th) the men\u2019s team are participating\nin a blitz with Oxford and St. Mary\u2019s\nuniversities.

Institute of Education.\nBasement dance studio. Saturday morning on which my\nlogic would have instructed\nme to stay in bed. In its stead\nI dragged myself to Warren Street to feed\nmy morals by attending Power Shift, a\nyouth climate change conference over\nthe course of the weekend.\nSheepishly following the schedule I\nfound myself in the room, storeys below\nthe grievances of gloom and rain, found a\nseat and saw the workshop convene.\nIn our circles, we took turns to present\nour story of \u2018me\u2019, an exercise on engaging\nand inspiring people on a personal level\nto become more aware of the environment and effects of climate change.\nIt was my go. And so I told them, from\nthe memoirs and diaries I had maintained within my head, the events and encounters that shaped the eco-initiatives\nthat defined my ethics and beliefs.\nThe lone kayak was hovering adrift, oars\nextracted from the clear waters and its\nrider reclined, head held high, silent in\nadmiration of the mighty glacial archi-tecture. The eyes were shut for a brief mo-ment, to give room to that bone-crushing\ncrackle as gallons of droplets glided down\nthe cascades. Then, as vision rebounded,\nthe discovery of the perfect synchronicity between hearing and sight, between\nsounds and landscape.\nI wouldn\u2019t have wished for a better, or\nindeed different, way to explore Milford\nSound, the famed fjord that deservedly\nmaintains a spot as the most-visited tourist site in New Zealand. But it is no less\nstunning than the places my family and\nI visited on a road trip around the South\nIsland: from the geological freak-show\nof an Abel Tasman National Park, the\nicy peaks of Mt Cook that nurtured Sir\nEdmund\u2019s mountaineering genius, to\nstretches of grape vines scattered across\nthe pastures of Marlborough and the\ncrystalline glaciers bearing the names\nFox and Franz Josef, \u2018God\u2019s own country\u2019\nis simply remarkable.\nNo wonder, with parents residing in\nAuckland and so frequent opportunity to\ntravel around the country, I have encountered numerous compatriots who have\nflown 23,000 miles to witness nature at\nits utmost glory.\nBut at what cost? Recent statistics have\nshowed that New Zealand, as a nation,\nis amongst those worst offenders of carbon emission, which includes Australia\nand the United States. Indeed, since\nAotearoa has a heavy economic reliance\non tourism, there is no surprise that the\nmajor contributors of such have been the\ntwo million tourists that visit the \u2018green\nnation\u2019 annually.\nAs I paddled furiously towards the\ncruise ship, in response to an announcement that dinner was served, I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but wonder how our sheer presence\nwas ironically destroying the environment we have come to admire.\nBetween conserving the natural environment and sharing the splendour with\nRecollections of an eco-tourist\nSo what is eco-tourism? Rummaging through his memory bank for the more eco-tastic moments, Dylan Lowe\npresents the enlightening instants of his travels, and explains his stance on the new trend of \u2018green travelling\u2019\nvisitors, generating local revenue and\ncareer opportunities in the meantime,\nwhere is the balance?\nThe thought persisted throughout din-ner, when I had encountered an equally\navid traveller at the dining table. Over the\nimmaculately prepared roast beef joint,\nhe recounted his own experience of visiting the Galapagos Islands. Similar to New\nZealand, a place he came to adore, Darwin\u2019s very own fountain of revolutionary\nideas was on the verge of losing the balance and will soon succumb to the effects\nexcessive tourism.\nThis is, he argued, the most fundamental question of what he described\nas \u2018eco-tourism\u2019: should one contribute\nto the wildlife\u2019s downfall by visiting and\nappreciating its magnificence in person,\nor should one seek to preserve and acknowledge it by limiting one\u2019s travels and\nnot visit the location at all?\nHe offered a third alternative: in a bid\nto quench what was his guilt for \u2013 at least\ntaking part in \u2013 driving the Galapagos to\nruins, he participated in a voluntary conservation programme and spent three\nmonths assisting in scientific research\nthat aim to safeguard the island\u2019s future.\nThat way, he pursued, he could offset the\nimpacts of his visit.\nAnd isn\u2019t this same guilt that drives\nus to mechanically submit our bank details to flight carbon emission offsetting\nservices, or take part in projects with an\neco-initiative?\nI was baffled by his insights. But then\nI was too ignorant, and indeed selfish,\nto even spare a thought on whether it is\nalright or not to \u2018erase\u2019 one\u2019s footprints\nby performing self-righteous acts of re-demption. No, the guilt wasn\u2019t sufficient\nto distract my intention to burn off my\nthree helpings of roast beef with an\nevening swim.\n*\nThe guilt level could easily rise above\nthe thatched bure and corrupt the\nstratosphere.\nI would walk away from the scene, disgusted with any affiliation I had with the\natrocities conducted without a hint of\nremorse traceable on the Fijians\u2019 faces.\nWell, walking away was out of the question \u2013 unless I had enough vigour remaining to allow me to swim a distance\na motorboat had managed to sail through\nin twenty minutes.\nHolding my breath, I went under again.\nThe Fijian guide caught sight of my approach and, eager to impress, snatched\na reef shark by its fin and hauled the\ncreature into his cradle, struck a pose. I\ninspected, and sighed \u2013 it was the same\nshark that had previously swum by me,\nplayfully rubbing its sandpapery skin\nagainst my belly. I gestured that I didn\u2019t\nhave a camera; clearly disappointed, he\nlet it go.\nEnough of this regime of cruelty, I\nthought as the Fijian kicked the shark\nin the head. I boarded the boat, rejected\nan invitation to snorkel again and sat in\nsilent protest. Of course, I couldn\u2019t have\nraised my voice and questioned their\nmodus operandi: not whilst giddy on\nthe choppy return journey or during the\nevening kava session, treated as a guest in\nthe local village. I couldn\u2019t have so rudely\ndeprived the other resort guests of what\nentertainment they deemed appropriate\n\u2013 evidently so as they were happily snapping away as the sharks wrestled for their\nsurvival \u2013 nor could I have risked offending my hosts. Though, as I spotted the offenders of hideous animal cruelty across\nthe grog matt, I found it hard to stomach\nmy discontent.\nPerhaps, from hindsight, I should have\nmentioned something.\nEco-tourism has achieved a commercial status that can rival that of Sainsbury\u2019s Basics; little surprise therefore\nwhenthepeopleofWayalailaihadnamed\ntheir local-run hotel an \u2018eco\u2019 haven resort.\nFrom the unpleasant experience, I\nmust give a judgemental statement: what\na hypocrisy.\nI have noticed that, similar to their effort to attract tourists by the branding,\nthe indigenous people are inclined to\nmodel their behaviours on the very people they served to please. It was the consequence of our disregard for nature and\nwildlife, that the Fijians have forsaken\nWayalailai \u2018Eco\u2019 Haven Resort The road to Mt Cook, where Edmund Hilary trained before conquering Everest\ntheir century-old coexistence with their\nenvironment, that they have corrupted\ntheir ideals upon the introduction of\nours.\nFundamentally, as much labelling as\none utilises \u2013 voluntary work, conservation projects \u2013 \u2018eco-tourism\u2019 simply cannot exist unless the self-proclaimed \u2018ecotourists\u2019 have a genuine desire to connect\nwith nature.\n*\nThe inhabitants of Tanna live out their\nlives in the very bosom of nature. It is\nimpossible to think otherwise when the\nlargest banyan tree \u2013 arguably the largest\norganism \u2013 resides on the pacific island,\nexplosion of lava quaking everything\nunder the volcano\u2019s feet in ten-minute\nintervals, primary mode of transport on\nhorseback, kastom dances and chants the\nmeans of praising nature, and practices of\na peculiar religion which regards Prince\nPhillip as a god.\nLike an Argentine I met, who had arrived at the island from an odyssey of\nself-discovery and unwittingly took up a\nsix-month placement at the local school,\nI became myself infected with the very\nmode of life that Westerners perceived\nbarbaric and sought to purge and rectify\nfor the past centuries.\nThat didn\u2019t eclipse my delight of finding a travel companion, as we set straight\nthe formalities of introduction in the\nback of the monstrous cross-islander van,\n\n"

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\nThere\u2019s nothing\ngreen here\nTh\nA\ns you have probably noticed by now, the film\nsection isn\u2019t quite following the \u2018green\u2019 theme\nthis week. I could try arguing that 2012 fits the bill of a movie\nconcerning climate change etc. but\nseriously, we should all be pretty confident that our beloved planet won\u2019t\nbe destroyed by neutrinos, we\u2019\u2019ll be a\nbit more responsible for the end of the\nworld than that. With The Men who\nStare at Goats and The Posters came\nfrom the Walls, I have no chance whatsoever of finding any relevant themes.\nSo I simply have no choice but to come\nclean and say that despite Dan\u2019s numerous e-mails, I have forgotten about\nthe idea of a themed issue this week.\nAnd being a bit lazy I have decided not\nto write something on the spot. Anyway, if you\u2019ve never tried writing in the\nfelix office you don\u2019t know what \u2018tough\nenvironment\u2019 means. Thus all you get\nthis week from me is a pretty pointless\nstring of words.\nTo give some semblance of meaning\nto this pitiful comment piece let me\ngrab this opportunity to thank all the\ncontributors. I am extremely proud of\nthe film pages this year and I can\u2019t even\ntry to fool myself that I\u2019ve had anything\nto do with that. No, Ed and I manage\nto print pages full of great articles each\nweek thanks to the students among\nyou who have the courage, drive, ego\nand the slightly masochistic streak that\nmakes you send in reviews week after\nweek after week. If you\u2019ve not heard it\nfrom others, at least hear it from me:\nthank you. You make my life so much\neasier.\nZuzannaBlaszczak\nZuzannaBlaszczak Film Editor\n1...2...3..., when I reach 10 you will take of your shirt and make pig noises..4...\nNot worth staring at goats\nSoldiers who can kill a goat\u2026 with\nmind bullets! Sounds brilliant, and\na great concept brought to the big\nscreen. Based on the book by Jon Ronson, the film follows a hapless journalist and a \u2018Jedi\u2019 soldier on a mission\nthrough war-stricken Afghanistan\u2026 or\nsomething like that.\nEwan McGregor plays Robert \u2018Bob\u2019\nWilton who is a small-time journalist\nin a small-time world. Suddenly, his life\nis torn apart when his wife leaves him\nfor his one-armed boss, so he impulsively becomes a war correspondent in\nAfghanistan. His stay is bleak until he\nrecognises the name of Lyn Cassady\n(George Clooney) from a previous\ninterview. Cassady reveals himself as\na level 3 psychic, who was previously\ntrained by the \u2018First Earth Army\u2019. The\ndesperate Wilton seeks refuge in the\nembrace of the psychic, and they venture out into the desert to discover\ntheir future, among other things.\nThroughout the film, Wilton narrates flashbacks of the story of First\nEarth Army. The founder of the unit\nis Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), who was\nconverted into an easy going hippy\nafter the Vietnam War. The team is\ntrained by Django with several predict-able, yet amusing moments. All is well\nuntil a new Jedi (Kevin Spacey) joins\nthe unit, and continues to betray the\nteam in an attempt to gain greater psychic power and the unit is disbanded.\nThe film is essentially a mish-mash of\npast and present, which unfortunately\nnever gains any real momentum. Considering the film is marketed as a com-edy, there are far too few good jokes,\nand it could be so much funnier.\nThe film is in fact based upon many\nshocking truths. The First Earth Battalion existed after the Vietnam War,\nand promoted peaceful methods of\nwar, including presenting lambs on\nthe battlefield to comfort the enemy.\nThe \u2018sparkly eyes\u2019 method, which is\nreferenced in the film, was another key\nweapon in their arsenal.\nOn screen, George Clooney is most\noften seen in a tuxedo with a quick\nscript and sharp wit, yet he seems at\nease inhabiting Lyn\u2019s quirky character.\nClooney\u2019s role is closer to his Oscar\nwinning performance in Syriana, than\nany previous rom-com charmer but\nhis rugged looks in the film are surely\nbound to keep the housewives swooning on command. McGregor acts a\nstandard McGregor role, and plays off\nClooney\u2019s character well.\nThe desolate surroundings of the Afghanistan deserts provide a great backdrop for a pretty bleak film. There\u2019s an\nuplifting soundtrack to back the film,\nand you\u2019ll be left with Boston\u2019s \u2018More\nthan a feeling\u2019 ringing in your head\nlong after the film ends.\nUnfortunately, there is little structure\nto the storyline, and the viewer is left\nstranded in the crossfire of a misfiring\nplot with little going on. Even the great\ncast cannot save the film from tedium.\nFilms you never grow tired of:\nOnce, there was a lonely old inventor\nwho decided to make a man. He called\nhim Edward. He gave him eyes, a brain,\nand a heart. But the inventor died before he could finish him, leaving him\nwith scissors for hands. Years pass, and\nthe first point of contact Edward has\nwith the outside world is\u2026 his local\nAvon lady.\nThis beautifully quirky fairytale,\nconcocted by Tim Burton when he\nwas still in school, is stunning in every\nway, with the attention to artistic detail\nTim Burton is renowned for, and a glit-teringly ethereal soundtrack. Filmed\nin 1990, this was the groundbreaking\nfilm on which the magical partnership\nof Tim Burton and Johnny Depp was\nborn, and the first \u2018alternative\u2019 film\nDepp acted in. The entire film feels like\nit has been shot inside a snow globe\ncontaining a generic 1960\u2019s Floridian\nsuburbia, with identical, Monopolylike houses and cars, perfectly manicured lawns and a chorus of gleefully\ntacky gossipy suburban stereotypes\nproviding the perfect backdrop for Edward\u2019s complete otherness.\nInnocent and child-like, all Edward\nwants is to fit in with the unexpected\nworld he has found himself in, which is\nmet with consequences, at times both\ntragic and hilarious.\nThe story is charmingly adorable in\nplaces, and does have romantic ele-ments, but its originality and quirky\nartiness keep it well out of the \u2018girly\u2019\nbox. A perfect film for a winter\u2019s night\nin.\nCharlotteIvinson\nCharlotteIvinson\nStefanZeeman\nStefanZeeman\n\n"

A week when\neco-warriors get high and\nmighty about their cause \u2013\nsaving the planet from imminent destruction \u2013 citing Al Gore\u2019s \u2018An Inconvenient Truth\u2019 at every opportunity.\nGlobal warming is a big issue both\npolitically and socially. We are being\ntold that it is almost too late to change,\nthat we are not doing enough to curb\nour use of hydrocarbons and that we\nmust watch our carbon footprints.\nIsn\u2019t it funny how just a few decades\nago there were warnings about us slipping into another ice age? Many scientists disagree with the claims put forward that global warming is due to our\nhunger for dirty fossil fuels. Admittedly, many of these are funded by oil\ncompanies who obviously do not want\nthe findings to harm their business.\nHowever, the government is much\nhappier to fund research that shows\nthe \u201ccorrect\u201d outcome; that fossil fuels\ncreate global warming.\nThis politicisation of climate science is wrong. Researchers should be\nfunded not depending on the outcome\nof the research or a person\u2019s particular\nview but on the quality of the research.\nThe government wants to send a\n\u201cmessage\u201d that we must cut down on\nour use of fossil fuels and halt destruction of the environment. The message\nmay be commendable, but politicians\nare again perverting science. As was\nseen over the last two weeks, this is\nan example of politicians digging their\ndirty hands into science and playing\ngames.\nI believe that we should cut down on\nuse of fossil fuels, increase energy efficiency and stop cutting down the rain-forests, but for different reasons \u2013 pollutants are harmful to us; oil will run\nout and new energy supplies must be\nfound; inefficiency is a pointless waste\nof resources and money; and destroying habitats means we will no longer\nbe able to marvel at the different land-scapes, flora and fauna.\nThere are restrictions on the concentrations of various pollutants allowed\nin the atmosphere. If we rewind back\nto the industrial revolution and even as\nlittle as 50 years ago there were no such\nrestrictions. Yet all we hear is how the\npollution occurring now is causing the\nwarming of the globe. All the graphs\nwe are shown to scare us into action\nshow the rapid increase in temperature\nvery recently. If it was linked to pollutant emission, would the temperature\nnot have increased back when pollution levels were higher?\nMany climate scientists point to the\nsun as an answer for increasing tem-peratures. Solar activity drives temperature changes and we are currently\ngoing through a period of high activity\nwhich, guess what, will naturally increase temperatures on Earth. Others\nhave realised that we are still coming\nout of an ice age. How surprising is it\nthat temperatures are increasing? I am\nnot saying we have no part to play, but I\nthink it is very arrogant of us to assume\nwe are to blame.\nI know that I have been banging on\nabout global warming, and green week\nis about more than this; it is about reducing waste, increasing efficiency and\nhighlighting the need for renewables. I\ntherefore commend the idea, despite\nmy reservations about the dubious use\nof science to \u201cprove\u201d the necessity of\nthese moves.\nIn the end each one of you should\nlook at the evidence yourselves, and\nthink very hard about whether you can\nlive with waste, inefficiency and the\nprospect of oil wells running dry in a\nmatter of decades.\nWith the Copenhagen conference\nfast approaching, many are claiming\nthat there is no hope for a deal. Governments should push for controls on\npollutants to prevent harm to citizens\nand for innovation in new technologies \u2013 \u201cclean\u201d coal, renewables. Do it\nwithout distorting science, and for the\nnon-political reason that it will soon\nbe necessary to say goodbye to fossil\nfuels as our primary source of energy\nand household materials. If we can get\nover the \u201cmessages\u201d and whether we\nagree with certain claims or not, we\nmay get somewhere by looking at the\nfacts and finding solutions to the problems we face.\nThis will not end with international\nco-operation and some abstract targets\n(we are a long way from meeting our\nKyoto agreement targets), there must\nbe serious policy changes at home.\nThe general population cannot be expected to take control of this problem,\nso money must be spent, where nec-essary, to ensure we have technology\nin place to replace current expiring\nsources.\nIt seems almost certain that the sea\nlevel will rise in the foreseeable future.\nWhy are countries not beginning to\ncontemplate the effects this will have?\nMass migration is a real threat and\nplans must be put in place to ensure\nthat these kinds of episodes can be\ndealt with carefully and properly. It is\nvery likely that borders will be broken\ndue to the huge influx of desperate\npeople.\nEqually, it is inevitable that countries\nwill attempt to tighten their borders,\nleaving many stranded. In some cases I\nwould expect boats to be purposefully\nsunk and many people shot to prevent\novercrowding. We as a people must try\nour best as far as possible to limit the\ndevastating effect we will have upon\neach other. This is as much of a concern as what to do about limited resources and what to do when they run\nout.\nTo the governments meeting in Copenhagen next month, whatever you\ndo, whether anything is agreed or not,\nplease do not politicise the scientific\nevidence.\nJames\nJames\nGoldsack\nGoldsack Politics Editor\nMilk: more than just cow juice!\nC\nDo you remember the Milk Rounds?\nOr the School Milk? (In all honesty,\nyours truly was not born when this\nwas around.) Well this is another one\nof those areas where the country has\ngone completely bonkers.\nConsider what we now get our milk\nin: environmentally hazardous plastic cartridges that have to be thrown\nout once they have been used. This of\ncourse, is counter productive as the\nthings are made of plastic i.e. oil, and\nmay have to be burned, thus releasing\nall those nasty gases the Green lobby\nkeeps banging on about.\nWhat has been done about this then?\nNot very much to be quite honest. But\nbefore we get to the Milk rounds, lets\nhave a look at what some food chains\nare in fact offering. Tesco have nothing but the plastic gear which is utterly\nuseless, particularly if you throw the\ninfernal thing out with the lid screwed\ntight. Some councils now employ peo-ple-this is not a joke-whose soul purpose is to pop the cartons so as to free\nsome space in the bins. The same story\nis true for most of the big stores, except\nSainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose. They have in\ntheir larger supermarkets started using bags of milk. Even the bags themselves are recyclable which is always\ngood. But obviously the main benefit\ncomes from not having a physical carton which you have to smash with your\nbare knuckles in order for the damned\nthing to become somewhat \u2018flat\u2019. Other\nbenefits include saving plastic and using that oil on, say, better equipment\nfor the armed forces.\nSainsbury\u2019s claim that the only way to\nopen the bag, without ending up covered in milk, is to place the bag inside a\njug and shut the lid. The special Sainsbury\u2019s jug has a spike which pierces the\nbag releasing the milk. Your humble\nnarrator can comfort the dear reader\nthat this is all complete bollocks. You\ndo not need a special jug. You need a\njug, but not a special Sainsbury\u2019s jug,\nand a pair of scissors. Cut off a corner\nand pour the bloody milk into the jug.\nIt is not rocket science and even if it\nwere the all-mighty Imperial student\nshould be able to handle it.\nIt is a bit odd that it only arrived in\nthe UK about a year ago; you can only\nbuy milk in bags in Canada. They do\nnot sell it in any other form (suppos-edly 60% is sold in bag form, the remaining 40% being some unknown\nform of storage particular to Canada).\nWhich begs the question: why are they\nintent on destroying the countryside\nwhen they might as well just outlaw\nany packaging which does not necessarily have to be made from the most\ninconvenient of materials? Do you really need cereal in a carton, is not the\nbag enough? And so on. While not\nwishing to be a mouth piece for the\nGreen lobby bandwagon, (which Imperial has happily hopped on \u2013 for it\nis a very profitable wagon, and as such\nsuits Imperial College perfectly) we do\nneed to reconsider the way we pack\nthings at least to save material.\nBut now the more pressing of ques-tions: why have they let the Milk\nRounds fall into despair, when it was\nprobably the most environmentally\nfriendly way of delivering fresh, cheap,\nlocally produced, milk? Bear in mind\nthat companies like Lidl insist on their\nmilk being sent from Germany to\nsome of its stores in Europe. I.e. The\nmilk you buy from Lidl is not, even by\nany stretch of the imagination, \u2018local\u2019\nif bought in Sweden, for example. The\nMilk Rounds use glass bottles (as you\nwill know by now that glass is 100%\nrecyclable) and the vehicles they spin\naround in are driven by electricity.\nThis is not to say that the industry\nis dead - far from it. From the website\nFindmeamilkman.net we have it that\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s 9,500 milkmen and women deliver to around 5 million homes\nevery day. Whilst fresh liquid milk in\nenvironmentally friendly returnable\nglass milk bottles remains the cornerstone of this service, your milkman can\nalso offer a large range of other goods.\nThey will be more than happy to discuss the range of products that can\nbe delivered regularly directly to your\ndoorstep.\u201d Now, a normal person in the\nUK consumes roughly 2 litres or 3.5\npints of milk each week. This is a fair\namount of milk. But one must wonder\nwhy are only 5 million homes in the\nUK getting their milk from this service\nwhich ought to be the Emperors of the\nmilk trade (and media and government\npolicy) in the UK, yet are not. A decade\nago, more than 2.5 billion litres of milk\nwere being delivered to the doorstep\neach year, which by 2004 had fallen to\n637 million. Only 13% of the milk now\nconsumed at home comes from delivery rounds (2006).\nWe can get pretty nostalgic about\nour doorstep milk deliveries. After all,\nthere cannot be many countries that\nhave had a record at number one in\nthe singles chart about a milkman. Comedian Benny Hill\u2019s record Ernie (The\nFastest Milkman In The West) topped\nthe charts in 1971 for five solid weeks.\nBefore the milk float, milk was delivered on wheeled carts \u2013 either horse-drawn or simply pushed. The milk was\nin a churn before the advent of the milk\nbottle, and the milkman poured it into\nthe jugs his customers left on their\ndoorsteps. A cloth cover over the jug\nprotected the milk from flies. The early\nmorning chink-chink of the milkman\nor woman and the hum of the electric float is declining in 21st-century\nEngland, despite efforts to extend the\nrange of products on offer to include\neggs, bread, juice and more.\nDespite rumours to the contrary,\nthere is no threat to UK milk deliveries from the European Union. However, as we move further into this\ncentury, it appears that the trend is\nbeing reversed because people are\nstarting to realise what this article has\nbeen arguing, that there is simply no\nway in which supermarket-milk beats\nmilkman-milk. As such, it is becoming more popular again and it is only a\nquestion of time before an MP of one\nilk or another seizes upon this issue\nto include in their portfolio of \u201cgreen\npolicies\u201d.\nInstead of building expensive \u201cecotowns\u201d, perhaps we ought to retrace our\nsteps to a time when people were far\nmore sensible (and greener) than they\nare now; without having to destroy the\nentire economy in the process.\nNeil Dhir\nNeil Dhir\nRemembering the good ol\u2019 days of the Milkman delivering to your front door\n\n"

Oh dear\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nMy girlfriend is a recently qualified\ngynaecologist; she deals a lot with\nold women. Personal hygiene is not\none of her fortes and since becoming\na doctor it hasn\u2019t improved.\nShe always has dirty finger nails\nand they have started to get really\nbad, to the point where I just try to\nblank it out. To add to this, during\nsex she often expresses her pleasure\nby digging her nails into my back. I\nhave developed some pussy pustules\nwhich look infected. What should I\ndo?\nTerry Bourbons\nDear Terry\nIt looks like you seriously need to address this. She needs to clean! Tell her\nsimply that unless she keeps herself\nscrubbed, you are not going to touch\nher. Be careful, though, as women can\noften go longer without sex from their\npartners than men. This is usually\nbecause they can get more action elsewhere because they have tits.\nSo if she holds out longer than you do\n\u2013 which is likely \u2013 don\u2019t find a prosti-tute, as you\u2019ll have to pay her extra to\nignore the pustules. Make an anonymous complaint to her hospital when\nyou get your back looked at. She may\nlose her job, but at least she\u2019ll not be\nputting her hands in any more granny\nfannies for a while.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nOn a recent visit home, I walked in\non my granddad having a wank over\nCoronation Street. He was making\nstrange groans and crying out \u201cDeidre\u201d\n. At the time I was horrified and\nscreamed \u201cyou dirty old man\u201d at him\nbut thankfully he did not notice me. I\nnow feel I was too harsh in my initial\ndisgust. How should I confront him?\nJack Offman\nDear Jack,\nThis does sound traumatic. It might be\nbest to not bring this up. He clearly has\nno idea that you caught him and it really isn\u2019t doing anyone any harm.\nMaybe next time you should be a little bit more cautious about entering\nrooms and your choice of seat. Consider buying him some sofa covers. People\nthat age tend to prefer neutral colours,\nsuch as beige or a light grey, but so that\nit is easier to clean up, consider buying\nthose plastic covers old people seem to\nlove.\nHope this clears up,\nAunty McPickle xxx\nSorry Granddad, but two things: 1) she\u2019s taken, and 2) ew seriously what the fuck?\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI have just returned from a trip to\nAmsterdam with my old mates from\nschool. As you can imagine some\npretty un-holy things happened but\none has scarred me mentally. Basically it took place in a dark hall,\nwhere a massively fat prostitute was\ndoing loads of tricks which involved\npulling things out of her vagina. This\nwas all reasonable but then she came\nover to me with a banana wedged\nbetween her poon-lips. I was asked\nto eat the slippery banana. I had do\nit. It smelt worse than shit. I can\u2019t\nexplain how bad it was but something was definitely rotten and it\nwasn\u2019t the fruit. I managed to do\nit and so have received nothing but\npraise from my friends but I am now\nhaunted with visions of decomposing poonanas.\nWill Fezito\nDear Will\nI think you should see a counsellor\nabout this. I think maybe some hypnotism may be needed to help you blank\nthis scented scene out. Otherwise, you\nmay have to wait until scientists discover mindbleach.\nYours,\nAunty McPickle xxx\nYes, the rumours are true (though, unless you\u2019re a hack, you probably haven\u2019t\nheard any of these rumours). We, RAG,\nare currently in possession of a deceptively heavy CGCU mascot which goes\nby the name of Bolt (pretty creative,\nsince it actually is a bolt...). He/she/\nit is being held in a secret location,\ngagged and blindfolded (but well fed\nnevertheless).\nLate at night, it cries for its dear older\nbrother, Spanner. Poor thing. We have\napproached the CGCU with a proposal\nfor its handover \u2013 possibly involving\nsome sort of ransom \u2013 and we\u2019ll keep\nyou informed on how things turn out!\nOn another note, with Christmastime coming up remarkably fast, RAG\nhas managed to secure some insanely\nawesome carol singing permits! Our\nvery own choir will be using their angelic voices to enchant passersby into\nsparing some change for our charities.\nThe first carol singing session is on\nFriday, the 4th of December at Green\nPark Station and it will be led by the\nImperial College Chamber Choir. We\nare taking along 5-7 collectors to this\nOld school carolling collections\nwonderful event.\nOur main carolling event will take\nplace on the 14th of December between 18:00 and 19:00, when RAG will\nteam up with the Main Choir to have\na carol singing/collection on a massive\nstage in, wait for it, Trafalgar Square! It\nwill be right under the huge Christmas\ntree and we will be taking along 15-20\ncollectors for this.\nTo make sure that you don\u2019t miss out\non either of these wonderful Yuletide\ncollection opportunities, e-mail RAG\nat rag@ic.ac.uk.

We\u2019ve\ngot an extra page, onto which\nwe\u2019ve sprayed a little some-thing-something about the next\ngeneration of gamers (and why you\u2019re\nnot invited). We\u2019ve also got a review of\nDragon Age, an RPG that\u2019s taking up\nfar too much student time this month.\nIt\u2019s also Green Week, and seeing as\nwe\u2019re so packed out with other stuff,\nnow would probably be a great time to\ntalk about how gaming impacts the en-vironment. In short \u2013 it doesn\u2019t, much.\nBut what it might do is change the\nway you impact the environment. I\u2019m\nnot talking about things like EcoKids\n(http://www.ecokids.ca) with abysmal,\nnineties-style games that funnel facts\ndown your throat at a rate of knots.\nThese sorts of games have little effect\non the player unless they\u2019re concentrating in a learning environment.\nWe want something more subtle than\nthat, something that\u2019s still fun. The difference between games as a social tool\nand, say, film is obvious \u2013 interactiv-ity. Consequence, choice, things like that.\nElectroCity goes some way towards that,\nby presenting a more enjoyable environ-ment. You can plonk down to beaches,\nprospect for gas and oil, implement energy efficiency bills and the like. It doesn\u2019t\npreach to you, there\u2019s more of a feeling\nof \u201cyou decide\u201d\n. There\u2019s a little rating that\ntells you how many rabbits died this year\nas a direct result of your actions but it\u2019s\nnot overtly educational.\nBut even this is just a little Flash game.\nYou\u2019re still sitting down to tackle an environmental problem. There\u2019s a \u201cserious\ngames\u201d movement dedicated to producing games that tackle difficult issues, and\neven Microsoft has managed to haul their\narse into gear by creating the \u201cGames For\nChange\u201d competition that encourages the\ndevelopment of games about a range of\ntopics, including the environment.\nBut it\u2019s all for the purpose of getting the\nmessage across, and that tends to get in\nthe way of really representing the intricacies of something like this. So this week,\nI\u2019ve been playing Democracy 2. And I\nthink that it\u2019s the best environmental issues game you could ever play. It\u2019s a simulation of political office: you\u2019ve just been\nelected President and you\u2019ve got to keep\nenough people on-side to get re-elected\nnext time. Among the many issues you\nhave to tackle is the environment. But\nyou\u2019llbesosnowedunderwithotherconcerns;thepressureofvotersandlobbyists,\nthe penalties inherent in actually solving\nthe problems at hand. The chances are\nyou\u2019ll probably barely have time to consider the issue, and even if you do, you\u2019ll\nface such stiff opposition that it\u2019ll cripple\nyou for the rest of your term.\nIt might be depressing, but people need\nto understand why things don\u2019t get done\nas much as they need to understand why\nthings should be done. Serious games\nneed to get serious, and drop the biased\nundertone.\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nTen Long Years \u2013 2005\nB\nlimey, what a year. Where\nto start. Let\u2019s jump right\ninto the middle of the year\n\u2013 this was the E3 where\nboth the Playstation3 and\nthe XBox 360 got their first airings.\nWith both the PS2 and the original\nXBox still going strong, it was a year of\nlooking ahead as well as looking to the\nshops \u2013 the God of War saga began\nthis year, as well as old faithfuls such\nas Tekken and Gran Turismo making\nnew appearances.\nOn the PC though, it was the summer that made the year so great. Battlefield 2 made modern day, 64-player\nonline matches possible in a way that\nno game had done or has done since.\n\u201cBattlefield 2 was, is, the best multiplayer experience I have ever had\nto date. The impact of the real-world\nsetting and the just-so balance\nof the gameplay and vehicles\nmeant that it was almost\nalways fun. I really hope\nsomething will come along\none day worthy of suceed-ing it.\u201d\nAnd then\n\u2013 unintentionally\nThemodernageofgamingbegins\u2013PS3,XBox360andhot,hotcoffee\ntopical \u2013 a developer called\nInfinity Ward released a\nsequel to a game they\nmade back in 2003,\nwith Call of Duty 2. CoD2\nreally pushed the series forwards,\nand began many of the gameplay\ntropes that are still in use in the\nlatest editions.\nSpeaking of franchise-defining re-leases, Lego Star Wars popped out\nthis year. Lu enthuses:\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t work, it certainly\nshouldn\u2019t work for adults, but it does.\nThe only recent platformer to overshadow it is Psychonauts which came\nout the same year.\u201d\nObviously I was about to mention\nPsychonauts. A game that no-one\nbought but everyone seems to love.\nOdd, that, eh? Go and buy a copy now.\nGo on, you miserable bastard.

Fielding in the Plate com-petition, they found themselves in a\ngroup with a Birmingham Universities/\nWarwickshire select, Cambridge University, St. Gabriel\u2019s (this year\u2019s London\nSenior League and Championship win-ners) and John Mitchel\u2019s (British Intermediate Championships winners).\nThe two club teams were always going to be more experienced than us,\nbut we knew we could give the two\nother universities a good challenge.\nHowever, both teams pulled out at\nthe last minute, leaving Imperial as\nthe sole third-level competitor in this\nyear\u2019s Plate.\nNot that this bothered us. We were\nthere to play hurling, and our first\nmatch was against John Mitchel\u2019s.\nDriven on by what can only be described as a gale behind us, Imperial\nplayed a very hard match against more\nexperienced opposition.\nThere was some great defensive work\nby David Noonan at full-back and Neil\nClancy at centre-back, both showing\nthat they were as proficient as their opposite numbers. Keith Laverty led the\nway up front, with Kieran Heatley and\nMark Jennings applying at lot of pressure in midfield.\nAs the first half wore on, Imperial\u2019s\nlack of accuracy in front of the posts\nIC at Hurls\nChamps\nwas beginning to show. Mitchel\u2019s in the\nmeantime managed to sneak in a goal\nand a couple of points. In the second\nhalf, they took great advantage of the\nwind, punishing some rookie mistakes\nby Imperial. John Mitchel\u2019s proved to\nbe the clear victor in the end, with Imperial learning some vital lessons from\nthe game.\nAfter a very brief break, St. Gabriel\u2019s\ntook to the field against us. Imperial\ngave a spirited show at the start of the\ngame with some great challenges made\nby Phil Jakeman and Padhraic Comerford; in the full-back line, Meathman Sean Dunne at corner-back and\nRostrevor native Eddie O\u2019 Hare at\nfull-back made some excellent dispos-sessions and clearances under heavy\npressure from a determined Gabriel\u2019s\nattack. Chris Farrell in nets made some\nvital saves but was eventually beaten by\nsome well set-up shots from the Gabriel\u2019s full-forward line.\nAt half-time, it was clear that the\nLondon champions would go on to\nwin the match, but Imperial gave a\ncommitted second-half performance,\nwith West Belfast\u2019s Stevie Gallagher\neventually scrambling the sliothar over\nthe line in a goal mouth fracas. Buoyed\nby their first score of the day, Imperial continued to apply pressure on St\nGabriel\u2019s but the senior club\u2019s experience came to the fore again and again.\nIn the end, there was a clear di-Finian McCann Hurling\nA mixed bag of results for ladies\nmedicals basketball\nThe ICSM Ladies\u2019 Basketball team\nplayed two games in the last fortnight.\nAfter the fusion of the two ULU divi-sions, the ladies are facing tough competition this season, having finished\nfourth in the second division last year.\nWith new players, a new kit and more\ngames than ever before, the team were\nanticipating a challenge. The first\ngame of the season was played at home\nagainst SOAS. Both sides seemed well-matched at the start of the game and, at\nthe end of the first quarter, everything\nwas even. However, at the start of the\nsecond quarter, ICSM took the lead,\nthanks to the scoring of Rachel Carten\nand excellent defensive rebounding of\nnew centre, Mariam Akinpeju. In the\nthird quarter, the tempo shifted to\nfavour SOAS and ICSM found their\nlead shrinking fast. Losing the lead in\nthe third quarter gave the medics the\nmotivation they needed to get back in\nthe game with a run of three-pointers.\nThe game ended with a comfortable\n10 point cushion for the ICSM Ladies\u2019,\nwith a final score of 43-33.\nThe second game was away against\nQueen Mary\u2019s, another team who\nplayed in the higher division last year.\nThe going was tough from the beginning with the fast-paced, aggressive\nstyle of the well-practised team re-HannahBarrett\nHannahBarrett Basketball\nContinued on page 38\nvealing the inexperience of some of\nthe ICSM players. The press caused\nmultiple turn-overs and Queen Mary\u2019s\nstar players found the holes in ICSM\u2019s\nzone. The half-court press gave the\nteam difficulties, preventing outside\nshooters from scoring. Though Akinpeju, Barrett and Lees opened up the\nzone with cuts, nobody\u2019s shots were\nfalling and, other than the occasional\nfast break, scoring was low. The game\nwent in Queen Mary\u2019s favour and the\nfinal score was 51-23. ICSM Ladies\u2019\ncaptained by Anita Ponnuthurai and\ncoached by Hannah Barrett intend to\nwork on the mistakes made in the last\ngame over the coming week in preparation for their game against King\u2019s.\n\n"

It was like going back to the days of Mr Ravi Pall,\nwhere each week this space was guaranteed to have been filled with incom-prehensible, poorly spelt drivel. But it\nwas entertaining, incomprehensible,\npoorly spelt drivel! I will do my best to\nimprove the standard of this editorial,\nand I think have managed to formulate\na master plan that Dr. Evil will be proud\nof.

And by... well, I hope you get\nthe picture by now.\nMoving on to the events of my life\nthis past week. I have to admit it\u2019s\nbeen a bit up and down really. It was\nmy birthday- a day I never enjoy too\nmuch. What with all these people who\nI haven\u2019t seen for ages bothering me-maybe there\u2019s a reason why we haven\u2019t\nmet recently? That being said I managed to get on a 14 or 414 (don\u2019t know\nwhich) bus at South Kensington, going\ntowards Fulham, only to wake up on a\n22 in Waterloo. Not sure how that happened as I am almost 100% sure I didn\u2019t\nget off the bus at any stage. Weird huh?\nSeeing as I had a free weekend, I\nthought I\u2019d go home to visit my mother\nwho has been giving me an ear bashing for a few months now. Never before\nhave I received such a bollocking! The\npinnacle was being told off for eating\ntoo much... Seriously, that is the best\npart about going home, you sit down to\ndinner, and wow! it\u2019s not pasta. I personally think she\u2019s gone a tad mental\nbecause when I was young she would\nalways force feed me potatoes and\nmeat to \u2018build me up\u2019.

Green is just a social convention, a\nfashion, a mating call. \u2018Check out that\nguy with his eco-friendly shopping bag.\nHe cares about the environment. He\u2019s\nsuch a caring guy. I love caring guys,\nhe\u2019ll care for me... blah blah blah...\u2019\nGreen is a show. No-one actually\nwants to do green. The only reason\nwe use recyclying boxes is because we\nlove to collect shiny things and arrange\nthem in height order.\nSo lets stop pretending that we care\nabout our children, or our children\u2019s\nchildren. That\u2019s a disgusting amount\nof children to be caring about. Lets instead worry about ourselves and how-we look because the most important\nthing in life is to care about what other\npeople think.\nTip 1 - CAN STAMPING!\nYou don\u2019t really know the logic behind\nstamping on your empty drinks cans,\nbut you assume it helps the recycling\npeople in some way.\nThat\u2019s a lie - you don\u2019t care about the\nrecycling people. You\u2019ve just seen too\nmany Blue Peter appeals in your lifeThere\u2019s not much you can do. Stop blaming yourself for the world\u2019s problems and start blaming everyone else.\nAnonymous\nAnonymous Hangman Editor\nBeginner\u2019s Guide to being Green\ntime and your endless can-stamping\nwas a dire attempt to win the coveted\nBlue Peter badge along with the affections of Konnie Huq. Ahhhh yeeeeahh,\nKonnie Huq! (Foreign Students may\nneed to do some background research\nhere).\nOf course, endless can-stamping,\ncombined with the bitterness of never\nactually receiving a Blue Peter Badge,\nsoon led to an implacable stamping ad-diction. There\u2019s nothing better than\npicturing the can with the face of some\nstupid smug twat and stamping the\nsmugness right out of that stupid smug\nface. Of course Hangman does not\nadvocate sticking the faces of your favourite twats onto your disused drinks\ncans and stamping them to death.\nHow to stick the faces of your favourite twats onto your disused drink can\nTip 2 - The Great Chirade\nIt is imperative that you shun all forms\nof fuel-consuming activities, including\npublic transport. Stop whining about\nthe late buses and tube-line closures\nand use your legs! Go out there and\nsave the world with your legs because\nthe world needs your legs and your legs\nneed a green world to live on. Smell the\nHangman\nHangman\nunion.ic.ac.uk/acc/football\nHangfan\nfresh outdoors and take time to enjoy\nthe beauty that surrounds you - ah fuck\nthis, take the bus.\nSo you\u2019ve just realised that you\u2019re too\nlazy to care. Of course you don\u2019t care,\nno-one cares. The only thing we care\nabout is looking like we care, thus a\nfoolproof plan must be implemented\nto pass off the illusion of your green\nendeavours.\nWhen going places, make sure that you\nalways get off one stop too early and\nrun the remaining distance. Inform\nyour friends that you are boycotting\ncarbon dioxide and saving nature by\nrunning everywhere. Your lack of fitness will only authenticate your lies as\na five minute jog will leave you ruddy-faced and sweating like an African\u2019s\nball-sack. Try to force a small tear\ndown your cheek as you weep for the\nfallen trees.\nTip 3 - Protestors\nThat\u2019s right, these tree-hugging, sun-worshipping druid tossers are only\ngiving you guys a bad name. You can\noften find them outside your local\npower-station, chanting scientifically\nmisinformed drivel about the environ-ment. Remember you are not one of\nthese people, nor do you want any as-We love hearing from the fans and have\nreceived some really warm feedback\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to ever feel the need to\ncomment/act/care about the \u2018banter\u2019 in\nFelix, BUT, I think last week\u2019s article was\nspectacularly\u2026wrong/offthemark/too\nun-PC. I was pretty disappointed to find out\nthat the article was a snobbish attack on\nthe \u2018working class\u2019.The content is what it is,\nbut to put it in Felix with Imperial\u2019s diverse\nrange of students as your target audience\nis just plain stupid. I won\u2019t be supporting\nFelix if content such as this continues to be\npublished.\u201d Die-hard Hangman fan\nsociation with them. Despite appearing\nto have similar views, they actually do\ncare about the world (remember that\nyou don\u2019t!). The problem is that they\nstroll around with their natural teeth,\ntheir natural clothes, natural hair and\nlook naturally disgusting. We haven\u2019t\neven mentioned that they period into\nmooncups. That\u2019s right, you\u2019ve now got\nto look up \u2018mooncups\u2019 and whether the\nword \u2018period\u2019 can be used in verb form.\nThey\u2019re so freakishly in love with nature that they just look weird. We all\njust look at them and think, \u2018Thank\nGod I\u2019m normal\u2019. In fact people are so\nscared of looking mildly hippie-like\nthat they try damn hard not too. In\nother words, hippies are putting us off\nmaking an effort to save the environ-ment. It\u2019s their fault! It\u2019s nothing to do\nwith our laziness, it\u2019s simply our determination not to be a hippie.\nWell, glad that\u2019s settled. It\u2019s the hippies\u2019 fault that I\u2019m so negligent and\ndon\u2019t give a shit. In fact I might just\nthrow this copy of Felix on that pavement over there.\nAnd if you\u2019re still worried, you can\norgansise a fuck-off concert with an\nextravagant lighting/sound system\nand jet celebrities in from all over the\nworld. That\u2019s a clever idea you American twat!\nthe_Cuddly_Racist\nJust been pwning some nabs on COD Modern\nWarfare 2!

I\u2019ve killd u loadz of times. Ur\nsuch a camper! U jst sit in your cave!\nSo it seems old Roy has left us for\nmore important things. Now everyone\nis starting to question his sudden de-parture. What\u2019s behind that stern and\nthreatending face? Does he really care\nabout diseases and all that? Noose of\nthe World has the exclusive scoop on\nthe Real Royboy!\nThere has been much speculation\nover this scandal and rumours have\nbeen spreading faster than Katie Price\u2019s\nlegs. A favourite seems to be that Royboy has actually started his own private crystal meth business. There have\neven been reports of him being seen\nwith Amy Winehouse.\n\u201cHim and Winers have been getting\non well recently.

    "content": "29\nfelix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nThe kids are alright (and valuable)\nFeeling old? Allow us to help \u2013 Mike Cook doesn\u2019t think you matter any more, and he\u2019s got two reasons why\nT\nhe Entertainment Software Association, a trade\nassociation for the US\ngames industry, has some\nstatistics on its website.\nAmongst these, one in particular\nstands out as strange: \u201cThe average\ngame player is 35 years old and has\nbeen playing games for 12 years.\u201d This\nechoes the findings of various and\namusing surveys held over the past few\nyears, the most recent carrying the delectable subheader that gamers are fat\nand depressed. However, anyone who\ntells you that the old folk matter in the\nindustry is plain wrong, because the\nfact of the matter is that the youngsters\nshape this industry \u2013 and you\u2019re not\none of them any more.\nYou might think that, as you sail towards your mid-twenties like a greased\ncinder block on a waterslide, you\u2019re\nentering the key target demographic\nfor gamers. You\u2019re at that point where\nanyone will listen to your ideas, no\nmatter how stupid they are. ESA findings are richer than just suggesting an\naverage age of 35 \u2013 they go on to state\nthat 34% of gamers are females above\nthe age of eighteen; that there are more\ngamers aged over fifty than under\ntwenty. But numbers like this\nare meaningless to\nbig business for one\nsimple reason \u2013 for\nthe ESA to count\nyou as\na gamer, you need to buy a couple of\ngames. For companies to count you\nas a target, you need to buy the most\ngames.\nWe talked to Andrew, a thirteen\nyear-old gamer, about the sorts of\ngames he likes to play now, and how\nmany he buys in a year.\nThe first game Andrew remembers playing is Croc on the Playstation. Croc was a 3D platformer aimed\nsquarely at kids, so it\u2019s no surprise\nAndrew cut his teeth on that. But that\nsoon led to more frenetic games that\nAndrew could play himself\n\u2013 Ratchet &\nClank on the PlayStation2 and Unreal\nTournament on the PC. Andrew certainly would\u2019ve beaten me at almost\nany game when I was his age.\nWhy are they more important? Because they grew up with the Playstation\nand the N64 \u2013 they grew up after the\npoint where gaming became a genuine\nNowadays, Andrew enjoys first-person shooters. He\u2019s playing Modern\nWarfare 2 at the moment, and hopes to\npre-order Halo Reach and Max Payne\n3 in the near future. When I ask him\nabout the violence in the games, he admits that some games do have a lot of\nkilling in them. But he\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d, he\nsays. It\u2019s easy to believe him \u2013 he says\nhe buys games based on their reviews,\nnot the number of guns in them. Still,\nhe seems to enjoy them nonetheless.\nAs time goes on, we\u2019re seeing\nmore and more distinction between\nthe gaming\nequivalent of\npop music\nand the rest\nof the mar-ket. There\u2019s\na mainstream core\nto gaming\nthat\u2019s by no\nmeans casual,\nbut has a particular feel to it \u2013 it\u2019s the\nsensation that runs through Far Cry 2,\nthrough Gears of War, through Smash\nBros. and through the modern Tomb\nRaiders \u2013 and this isn\u2019t a point about\nviolence being made here. It\u2019s a point\nabout simplicity, what\u2019s marketable,\nand how much effort is required to sell\nanother unit to someone who made a\npurchase one, three, six months ago.\nIt\u2019s almost evolutionary \u2013 a games\nstudio will offer a twist on a currently\npopular game, and the kids either buy\nit or don\u2019t. You don\u2019t get that sense of\nprogression in the older demograph-ics. You don\u2019t get much at all, really, except Puzzle World Crossword Touch.\nWhilst we have the most disposable\nincome, we don\u2019t make or break games\nany more at our age. We\u2019re predictable,\nrepetitive, and we don\u2019t buck the trend,\nand this is why we no longer shape the\nindustry. So peruse the two articles our\nyoungsters wrote, and remind yourself that they\u2019re the trend-set-ters now. Looks like mods\nand Mario Kart are in\nthis year, then.\n\u201cthey\u2019re the\ntrendsetters now\u201d\nReview: Mario Kart\nIt has a wide range of tracks and vehicles but you do not get them straight\naway. You have to win or get second or\nthird place to open new tracks. Sometimes, you get a few glitches in the\ngame but the game corrects itself. The\ngaming characters are Mario, Luigi,\nYoshi, Birdo, Baby Luigi, Funky Kong,\nDry Bowser, Rosalina, Daisy, Bowser\nJr, Dry Bones, Baby Daisy, King Boo,\nDiddy Kong, Toadette.\nYou can also play multi-player. I think\nit is more fun to play with your friends\nbecause you have more of a challenge.\nYou can also go online where you can\nrace people around the world if you\nhave wireless internet. And on the\ngame you have different objects you\ncan get to help you out, like a banana\nor triple banana that make other cars\nspin out of control. You also have one\ngreen shell or three of them that you\ncan use to knock over vehicles only\nin a straight line. One red shell or you\ncan have three that lock-on to vehicles\nin front of you. A Bom-omb explodes\nknocking over any vehicle in the area.\nA spiny shell can hit the leading vehi-cle. There are other items you can use\nin the game such as a fake item, dash\nmushroom or three of them, golden\ndash mushroom, bullet bill, blooper,\nlightning, super star, mega mushroom,\nPOW block, thundercloud. These\nmake the game more fun to play. You\ncan use a choice of vehicles in the\ngame. They are a motorbike and a car/\ngo-kart. The controls are easy to use\nwhen playing.\nI would rate this game.\nFeature: Modding\nJamie\nJamie Games Reviewer\nAre mods worth it? The way to put this\nis, yes, they are an amazing waste of\nyour life.\nMods have become very popular in\nthe world of gaming, people making\nmodifications of their own with special\nprograms. When you play your first\nmod or get your first flippin\u2019 skin to\nwork in Counter Strike, then you like\nmods and want to make one yourself.\nMods give us something that an ordinary game won\u2019t give us. Take Unreal\nTournament 3 \u2013 this is a game where\nyou can\u2019t get many characters in so\nthere are new ones with new sounds,\nskins and more.\nA good mod is one that can change\na game completely like The Haunted\nwhich changes Unreal completely. You\ncan play on your own or with friends.\nIt is a mod set in a church, the west\nand many more places so you can kill\nzombies! I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\nsaid when you got GODLIKE. Instead\nit said ZOMGWTFBBQ.\nWhen modding a game you need to\nbackup the files so if the mod does not\nwork you can get the old stuff back and\nwork on the other mod while playing\nthe game as well.\nIf you are like me and you like mod-ding UT3, you should definitely mod\nthe mutators to get more of an effect\non the game. I\u2019ve been using the Gibalicious mutator which increases the\ngore and blood. Also there is the Gears\nof Unreal mutator which gives you the\nGears of War style mode. The jetpack\nmutator is a jetpack and if you hold\ndown jump you fly around the whole\nmap (I recommend doing that on the\nmap Deimos because it is a very big\nmap).\nSo that is my thought on mods and\nbasically they are good if you have\nnothing to do and you are bored of the\ngame you\u2019ve got.\nAndrew\nAndrew Games Writer\nWe asked Jamie\nand Andrew,\ntwo 13 year-old\ngamers, to write\nus something\nabout what they\nlove doing with\ntheir gaming\ntime.\nLet us know\nwhat you think\nof our two new\nwriters, and\nwe\u2019ll pass your\ncomments on:\ngames.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\nindustry. The over fifties are unlikely\nto buy much more than the DS games\nand occasional puzzle stuff that\u2019s tailored specifically for them. It\u2019s a lot of\nwork; it\u2019s not a dependable source of\nincome. Younger gamers, though, are a\nnew breed. They\u2019ve been brought up\nwatching games and seeing them as\na big part of their life. Through this\nthey\u2019ve learnt what to expect,\nand that makes them easier\nto sell to.\n\n"

For years I have had an\nincredibly unhealthy diet, including biscuits, chocolate, breadsticks\nand most recently I have fallen in love\nwith peanut butter sandwiches. My\nflatmates over the years have all joked\nabout my strange eating habits.\nHowever, it is important to at least\nattempt to eat healthy and nutritional\nmeals- as I am sure you already know.\nTo help you on your way I have included a recipe of one of my favourite\nHolly Cumbers thought this was tasty! James Kightley changes his views on vegetarianism? Perhaps...\nMy favourite five green vegetables...\nHolly Cumbers explores ways in which you can get your 5 a day!\nA\ns this is the green issue\nI thought I would do a\nspecial article on my favourite green vegetables.\nSeaweed has to be\nnumber 1. Admittedly not to everyone\u2019s taste (I don\u2019t really understand\nwhy!), this vegetable is packed with\ncalcium and magnesium (making it\nan excellent substitute for milk). I love\nseaweed on its own with just a sprinkling of herbs on top. It always tastes\nbest when cooked properly, something\nwhich I can never master-but it should\nbe fairly easy. This is a perfect dish to\norder when you go for your next chinese meal.\nNumber 2, Popeye\u2019s favourite food-Spinach. Spinach is jam packed with\niron, calcium and antioxidants- now\nI know why Popeye was always so\nstrong!\nSpinach has to be cooked properly\nin order to be fully enjoyed. I recommend adding spinach to pizza as it\ndoes actually taste nice- and you don\u2019t\nhave to feel bad tucking in to a divine\nsnack.\nAlthough I used to hate it as a kid,\nnumber 3 would now be cabbage. Unfortunately, I can never shake off those\nterrible memories of school dinner ladies slopping it on to my plate. However, this vegetable shouldn\u2019t be grumbled at- it is packed with vitamin C.\n4 goes to Brussel Sprouts- again\nonly for the acquired tastebuds. So\nmany people find these disgusting\nsimply because they are overcooked.\nI love brussel sprouts with chestnuts\nat christmas or in a stir-fry, both are\nextremely tasty. Brussel sprouts are\nfull of protein and vitamin A, which\nmakes them an excellent replacement\nto meat, giving you essential nutrients\nthat are often difficult to get from a\nvegetarian diet.\nAnd finally courgettes (I am not\n100% sure whether they can be called\ngreen vegetables but what the heck\nthey are still nice, and of course\nhealthy! Very healthy. They are filled\nwith wholesome vitamins such as\nfolate acid and vitamin A- and you do\nnot need to worry about putting on\nany weight as they are incredibly low\nin calories). I love them when they\nare cut into chips and then fried. My\nfriend also suggested to me the other\nday that courgettes are excellent when\nthey were fried in breadcrumbs.\nThere are so many creative things\nthat you can do with green vegetables.\nIt is really fun to explore new recipes\nand different ways of cooking green\nvegetables. Not only is it fun but it is\nalso essential for a vegetarian diet. So\nhave fun! I am sure you will!\nC\namden is famous for its\narty stalls- selling alternative dresses, gorgeous\ntrinkets and most impor-tantly, so much vegetarian food that it feels almost heaven-like. There are dishes from all over the\nworld. On Saturdays and Sundays they\nhave places where you can sit and eat,\nso you can eat your food whilst watching the world pass you by.\nI particulary enjoy visiting Green\nNote cafe, although this isn\u2019t technically a food stall the prices are still extremely good.\nThe cafe is both a live music venue\nand purely a vegetarian cafe (If you are\na full strung meat eater I would avoid\nthis place like the plague! As you won\u2019t\nget served any meat here!). I tend to\nvisit this place on a Sunday as they\nhave open mic sessions where people\njust come up and sing for you- you can\nget some really random and fun acts\nsometimes, which will always brighten\nup your day.\nI instantly fell in love with the friendly and relaxed atmosphere. You can\nreally make yourself feel at home here.\nThe staff make you feel as if this is\nwhere you belong with their compliments and their genuine smiles. You\njust know they genuinely want to look\nafter you and give you the best possible\nservice.\nThe menu is full of nutritional and\ntasty dishes from all over the world\n(they call it world tapas), but they also\nhave larger food dishes available. We\ndecided to order several dishes as we\nwere told that they might be small-however as the dishes start from only\n\u00a33.50 it is what you would expect. We\nopted for the mixed vegetable samosas,\nwhich were served with mango chut-ney, the mixed olives and the mango\nand halloumi salad- which caught our\neye as it sounded so exotic! And the tex\nmex dips- which were served with tomato salsa and guacamole. All the ingredients they use are organic.\nThe food arrived really quickly,\nwhich was good as the divine smells\ncoming from the kitchen were driving us crazy. All the dishes were well\nprepared.\nThe food is amazing and I think\nthat is why I keep coming back to this\nlittle cafe. It always tastes better than\nthe money I spend on it. The dishes\nare always filled with so many different\nflavours.\nNext time you are in Camden pop\nby- I am sure they will be pleased to\nsee you and they will make you feel like\none of the family. Just bear in mind that\nit is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays!\nI would advise a lazy Sunday here......\nT\nhey\u2019ll love you- but will\nyou love them?\nI must admit that when\nI received an email this\nweek asking me to review a vegetarian restaurant to celebrate green week, my heart sank. I\ndecided, nevertheless, to put my preconceptions of vegetarian food aside\nand began scouring the internet for\nsomething that might inspire me. So\nimagine my joy when I came across the\nrestaurant Tibits. A fully vegetarian\nrestaurant with the tag line \u201cFood that\nloves you back\u201d. How could I possibly\nrefuse\u2026\nLocated in a beautiful, bustling,\npedestrianised street called Heddon Street, set just back from Regent\nStreet, Tibits offers a large terraced\narea in front of the restaurant, which\nI imagine is a joy in the summer. Inside the restaurant, the atmosphere is\nrelaxed and the d\u00e9cor colourful and\ncasual with bench seats in the large\nwindows, which give the restaurant\na wonderful feeling of extra outside\nspace. Tibits is a great choice for all\nage groups, and a great place to go for\na casual evening with friends.\nTibits is a Swiss concept and is, as\nis so popular on the continent, a self\nservice buffet. This is one of the greatest things about Tibits, as it is in my\nmind what makes it successful. As may\nhave been obvious from my initial re-action, I am an avid meat-eater and the\nthought of chomping my way through\na large portion of imitation chicken\nand cubes of soy was horrifying, however on entering I was pleasantly sur-prised. On entry you are immediately\nconfronted by an enormous \u201cboat\u201d,\nheavily laden with all manner of vegetarian dishes, and I have to admit that\nI was genuinely excited to try each and\nevery dish on offer. There are over 40\ndishes on offer, which take inspiration\nfrom all over the world. These range\nfrom vegetable red Thai curry, to\nfalafels, dahls, and all manner of interesting cold vegetable and pasta dishes\nwith exciting dressings. Although no\nparticular dish jumped off the plate at\nme, the quality was very good and the\nvariety and combinations worked well\nto create a very pleasant meal.\nI would like to say that the service\nwas very good. Being a self service restaurant however, there really isn\u2019t any!\nWhat I can say is that the staff were\nvery friendly and helped explain how\nthe concept worked, part of which was\nto pay for the food by weight. Your\nfood is weighed at the bar area, the\nfortunate thing being that vegetables\ntend to be light. This means one can\nenjoy a full plate of food for around\n\u00a38, and a pudding bowl selection for\naround \u00a33-\u00a34. There are also various\nhealthy fruit drinks on offer, you know\nthe ones I mean, like \u201cVit boost\u201d etc. I\nhad a\u201d Tutti Frutti\u201d on the recommendation of the Manager - tasty enough,\nbut only as good as a smoothie I could\nmake at home and for \u00a33.30 for a small\nglass, I felt that it wasn\u2019t really worth it.\nI can assure you, you won\u2019t leave\nfeeling hungry, the food it is very sat-isfying, and healthy to boot. There\nare different prices for 100g of food at\ndifferent times of the day - \u00a31.40 for\nbreakfast, \u00a31.80 at lunchtime, and \u00a32\nat dinner. All in all this makes for a\nvery affordable meal, particularly considering the location of the restaurant.\nSo have I changed my mind on vegetarian food? I suppose I have. If a vegetarian friend suggested Tibits for dinner I would not feel disappointed at all,\nand if I were a vegetarian this would\ncertainly be a place I would frequently\nreturn to. I\u2019m not sure if I love Tibits as\nmuch as it claims to love me\u2026 but we\nare certainly friends.\nRecipe for a scrumptious cheese-potato pie!\n(Student Style)\nIngredients:\n4 or 5 potatoes- make sure they are washed peeled and cut into quarters\n200 grammes cheese- can be any cheese, but I think cheddar cheese works best\n1 onion- can be either red or white depending on taste, make sure it is sliced\n1 tomato or use two if they are small, again make sure you cut it into slices\nHerbs for flavour, I usually add mixed herbs and a sprinkling of salt\nBegin by boiling and mashing the potatoes (for a creamier texture add milk) and\nadd salt for flavour. At the bottom of a casserole dish create a layer of potatoes,\nfollowed by a layer of cheese, then another layer of potato. Finish off with another layer of cheese. Put under the grill for twenty minutes. Then add the sliced\ntomato and the sliced onion. Put back under the grill until it goes golden brown.\nEnjoy your tasty but nutritious meal!\nVegetarianism in Camden\nHolly Cumbers reviews food in Camden\ndishes- cheese and potato pie. This\nrecipe is easy to make, cheap and\nwarming on a cold winter\u2019s night-and what\u2019s more you can easily make\nenough for at least two meals, which\ngives you enough time to do some\nmore coursework- joy!\nTibits, the best vegetarian food?\n\n"

But\nrather than running around in spandex\ntackling rubber villains, these students\nwill be taking small actions to save energy \u2013 like switching off lights and appliances and putting a lid on the pan\nwhen cooking.\nThis is part of a national Student\nSwitch Off campaign that is running in\nhalls of residence over the whole academic year. The campaign, run in association with the NUS and WWF, gets\nhalls of residence to compete against\neach other to save energy. The hall that\nsaves the most energy per person at the\nend of the year on gets a big party for\ntheir whole hall.\nAs well as the communal incentive\nfor the winning hall, individuals who\nhave signed up as Eco-Power Rangers\ncan also win prizes such as Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, tickets to London clubs,\nas well as energy-saving gadgets. These\nprizes can be won by posting energy-saving pictures on the \u201cImperial College Eco-Power Rangers\u201d Facebook\ngroup.\nPhoto competition winner Daniel\nJackson commented, \u2018Climate Change\nand Global Warming are no longer\ntheories, but facts. Student Switch\nOff is a great way to get involved and\ndo the right thing in so many ways so\nSWITCH OFF!\u2019\nLast year the campaign saved almost\nten per cent of the energy used in halls\nacross eleven universities. This year\n10,000 students across the country\nhave signed up, so the savings will be\nmuch bigger.\nAt Imperial this scheme is being piloted at Southside, Weeks & Garden\nand Evelyn Gardens which represents\n1,096 students and if successful will be\nrolled out to other halls next year.\nImperial\u2019s Halls of Residences are going head to head in a bloodthirsty battle to reduce their carbon emissions\nTo become an Eco-Power Ranger\nand maximise your chances of winning\nsome of these great prizes either join\nthe Facebook group Imperial College\nEco-Power Rangers or e-mail ecopow-errangers@studentswitchoff.org.\nRemember you don\u2019t have to be in the\nparticipating halls to take part- everyone is in with a chance to win prizes!\nFor further information contact Andy\nHix on andy@studentswitchoff.org,\n020 8287 0227 or 07734 965465\nAndyHix\nAndyHix Student Swtich-Off\nBanning the Bulb?\nAs we are all no doubt aware the government it trying to take away all our\nincandescent bulbs, starting with voluntary bans by some suppliers targeted mainly 100W and higher as well\nas frosted, but with an aim to remove\nthem all. In the UK it is expected that\n5 - 25 million tonne of carbon dioxide\na year could be saved from the reduced\nenergy consumption by switching over\nfrom incandescent lighting.\nThe EU ban is by no means revo-lutionary. Cuba was the first nation\nto put a ban on incandescent bulbs\nin 2005/2006 in favour of fluorescent\nlighting. The motivation behind this\nwas to reduce the load on the national\ngrid and prevent black outs that had\nbeen affecting the island. Ten other\nCaribbean countries and Venezuela\nhave since instigated similar policies.\nAustralia was the first nation to initiate a ban of incandescent lights with\npurely environmental motives. With\nthe warm climate of the country it was\nseen as wasteful for the heat from incandescent bulbs to add to the electrical load required for air conditioning.\nThe Environment minister predicted a\n4 million tonne reduction in the country\u2019s 513 million tonnes of national\nAs EU ban comes into force we are forced\nto reconsider using CFLs\nDavidSharp\nDavidSharp Green Reporter\nErica Thompson ponders \u2018sustainability\u2019\nThe adjective \u201csustainable\u201d seems to be very trendy these days. Sustainable development, sustainable holidays,\nsustainable tinned tomatoes - you name it, and the green PR machine will sell it to you, probably at a premium to the\nnasty \u201cunsustainable\u201d stuff on the opposite shelf. So you assuage your slightly doubtful guilt by buying \u201csustainable\u201d\nproducts and forget all about it - you\u2019re doing your bit, right?\nTo answer that, you have to go back to what \u201csustainable\u201d actually means. The opposite of sustainable is \u201cunsustainable\u201d, meaning \u201cnot able to be sustained\u201d. If you keep doing something which is unsustainable, you will eventually\nreach a point where it cannotcontinue, due to physical limits.\nIf we wish our civilisation to continue on this planet indefinitely, then we must live sustainably - by definition. If we\ndon\u2019t live sustainably, then our civilisation cannot continue on this planet indefinitely - by definition.\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that if we have a finite amount of some resource, and we use it up at any rate other than zero, then we\nare living unsustainably. On this planet we have a finite amount of oil, coal, natural gas, water in aquifers, diamonds,\nuranium, gold, selenium, etc. The only sustainable net rate of consumption of these resources is zero, and in order to\navoid crashing into that brick wall of depletion we must either drastically downscale or shift to reliance on renewable\nresources within a couple of decades. Think about the consequences that has for our economy.\nWe also have a finite atmosphere. The effects of splurging vast quantities of CO2 into it are becoming more apparent by the day. The only sustainable net rate of production of CO2 is zero, and in order to avoid catastrophic climate\nchange, accompanied by mass starvation and migration, we must drastically cut emissions within a couple of decades.\nThink about the consequences that has for our economy.\nSo a sustainable economy is necessary, but it is possible? Is it possible that within our lifetimes we can re-gear the\nentire human way of life so that we really are acting sustainably?\nI think it is, but it will be a huge challenge. For centuries we have squandered our most precious energy resource\n- oil - on luxuries for the rich rather than on the basic needs of the poor. We have invested overwhelmingly in cars,\nfossil fuels and big industry instead of bicycles, renewables and social projects. The lip service fashionably paid to\n\u201cbeing green\u201d has not reduced our emissions - instead, it has created a generation of brainwashed, greenwashed,\n\u201ceco-friendly consumers\u201d who truly and with the best of intentions think that offsetting the emissions of their flight to\nSouth Africa make it sustainable and that buying Kenyan green beans benefits the local economy!\nThere are only a few short years to act on these problems. Sustainability cannot continue to be a marketing tag - it\nmust become a way of life if we are to survive. Physical limits are not subject to international negotiation; they will\nnot come up trumps with \u201cbail-outs\u201d for damaged ecosystems or new fossil fuels for countries who cannot wean\nthemselves off it. We, the scientists and engineers of Imperial College, are some of the best-placed people to bring\nabout these urgent and necessary changes in the way the world produces anduses energy. We must walk the walk as\nwell as talking the talk. In our own lifetimes it will become clear whether we have succeeded or failed - this is a heavy\nresponsibility.\ngreen house gas emissions by 2012 as\nwell as cutting domestic electrical bills\nby 66%. Due to the specialisation in incandescent technology use this is not\na blanket ban but will have exceptions\nsuch as oven lights and for medical\nuses.\nCFLs have been shown to have lower\ncradle to grave CO2 emissions and well\nas cost. Yet in Europe the ban has been\nmet with much opposition. Mostly this\ncomes from European countries which\nhave driven to use CFL in the last decade when the technology was much\nless mature. Because of the initial failure excuses are made for not attempting to give these lights a second go.\nThis is not helped by companies such\nas EDF giving free ultra poor quality\nlow wattage light bulbs when trying\nto be \u2018green\u2019. Or the bulbs themselves\ndown matched in stores (80W equivalent lamp gives out less then equivalent\nthe 80W of light, a policy aimed to try\nand get people to use lower lighting\nlevels and so less power).\nBanished to the archives soon?\nI would recommend giving the old\nCFL a second chance. Get one manufactured by a recognised brand; slightly\nhigher \u2018equivalent\u2019 rating then your incandescent and try to have a look at\nthe different colours and shapes to find\nwhat you like- it\u2019s a way of avoiding dis-appointment! Some stores will let you\ntry out the bulbs; most super markets\nwill not. If you think the government\nhave gone too far with incandescent\nlamps be warned that halogen lamps\nand high power torchieres are next!\nLighting the future\nLED technology it certainly going to\nbe a more and more common feature\nin lighting and we are not just talking\nbike lights and screens, but industrially buy tomato farmers in Canada and\npowerfully in the new-year ball in time\nsquare, LED technology has improved\ndramatically and continues to do so\nand unlike most other technologies are\nno where near their theoretical limit of\nefficiency. Before you encourage Imperial to replace all the lighting with\nsupper efficient LED\u2019s (you can get\nLED arrays to replace, and look like,\nfluorescent tubes) there is that issue of\ncost, which makes these currently unsuitable except in very low heat/ power\napplications.\n\u2018Hybrid systems\u2019 is a popular \u2018solution\u2019 in most industries but what does\nit mean for lighting? We are not talking a sky light and a dimmer switch,\nalthough that works well (if you get the\ncorrect type of dimmer switch for your\nflorescent lamp). But the a full spectrum hybrid lighting system as proposed by the Solar Energy Laboratory,\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison,\nwhere you collect solar light separate\nthe IR out for water heating or thermal photovoltaic and run the visible\naround the building with fibre optics\nto produce a natural lighting that has\nno heat attached to fight with the air\nconditioning. Nice when your office\nis in Hawaii not the best solution for\nfrost bitten student accommodation in\nLondon and starting at $4K it will take\nsome time to see the investment paid\noff (about 10 years in Hawaii).\nIf you like try something different\nthere are other technologies out their\nlike the \u201cElectron Stimulated Luminescence\u201d by Vu1 who claim to be sitting\non lighting technology that is cheaper\nthen CFL and more efficient then\nhalogens. This could be an enlightening solution to our energy problems\nor simply the next carbon arc lamp.\nAesthetically and functionally they are\nsimilar to incandescent but they are\nstill less efficient than the CFL.\nAnd for those who still think LED\u2019s\nkill the batteries too fast on your bike\nlight you could always try a USAF nuclear powered torch; guaranteed durability and long life.\nSo as you toss the refined curves\nof the incandescent bulb in the bin,\nwhat you replace it with need not be\nsterile or inferior but should be more\nefficient.\n\n"

So try to seek out what we list\nand recommend. If there is anything\nyou have seen recently, particularly\nanything interesting, off-the-beaten-track, do let us know! Any reviews will\nbe happily received and considered for\nselection for future issues.\nOn that note, this week Bernard\nPereira offers up a review of one of\nthe National Gallery\u2019s current exhib-its, \u2018The Sacred Made Real\u2019. It brings\na much-welcomed antique element to\nour Arts pages this week, for it is my\nfirm belief that historic art informs\nhow artists create work today. That\nis something you can also judge for\nyourself.\nBringing us right up to today, I have\nmade a brief review of \u2018Pop Life: Art in\na Material World\u2019, currently on show at\nthe Tate Modern. I feel this is an exhibit one needs to see in actuality to\nfully gauge the \u2018slap-in-the-face\u2019 quality of most of the artworks. Although\nI found it still quite socially and mentally challenging, my article hopes to\nexpress the tension between contemporary and now what is also sliding\ninto the historic, with this show.\nMoving back up the river to Trafalgar Square, my co-editor Caz Knight\nreviewed an exhibit currently showing at the National Portrait Gallery,\n\u2018Beatles to Bowie\u2019 \u2013 a fairly self-explan-atory title. I would consider this a second part in Caz\u2019s recent exploration of\nLondon retrospective music exhibits,\nwhich she thoroughly investigates for\nour reading pleasure.\nWe are glad to say at Arts, we are\nreceiving articles regularly from contributors and will try and post them all.\nWhatever we think is interesting and\nwritten in a clear and concise manner\nwill be considered!\nNext week, Caz Knight and I will be\nattending the press launch of Damien\nHirst\u2019s new show at the Jay Jopling\u2019s\nWhite Cube spaces in the West End\nand East End. Hirst is an artist who,\nalthough his artworks do not always\nagree with me, is certainly one who\ncrops up a lot in my critical thinking.\nHe is an artist who has an impressive\ncommand of the commercial art market and never fails to fuel tabloid columns (including these, of course!). So\nwe shall be reporting back our opinions of his return to painting after the\nopening of the show next week.\nNext week, look out for a new feature\nwithin these pages: \u2018Why I Like ...\u2019 \u2013 a\nspecific focus on artists and other cultural figures who inspire us and why,\nspearheaded by our co-editor Lucy\nHarrold.\nI\nwas sitting at home recently, listening absent-mindedly to the\nnews, when I heard a report\nabout a \u2018controversial\u2019 new exhibit at the Tate Modern, which had withdrawn an artwork even before opening\nto the public.\nIt seems to be to be a rare thing these\ndays to find an artwork that shocks and\nappalls the public to the extent that it\nis removed. Saatchi\u2019s collection of elephant poo canvases, blood heads and\nportrait of Myra Hindley composed of\nchild handprints pushed the limits of\nwhat viewers could stomach, but now\nthat its \u2018been done\u2019, is considered blas\u00e9\nby gallery-goers. However, in the case\nof the Tate Modern\u2019s brashy new show\n\u2018Pop Life: Art In A Material World\u2019, it\nwas not the clamouring public who\nhad Richard Prince\u2019s photograph (of\na photograph) of a pre-pubescent\nBrooke Shields posing, nude in her\nbath, heavily made-up (need I go on?)\nremoved, but the Tate themselves ushered in the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Obscene Publications Unit out of sheer\nconcern for \u2018doing the right thing\u2019.\nThe exhibit begins, naturally, by\nleaning heavily on Andy Warhol \u2013 the\n\u2018father of Pop\u2019. Yet it focuses on the\nmore crude and commercial side of\nthis artist, his \u2018sell-out\u2019 phase, where\nhe would do a cheap deal on a double\nportrait for any willing punter. Damien\nHirst makes an appearance \u2013 an artist\nrecognised for his sheer manipulative\ngrip on the world art market, having\nmade over \u00a3112 million at a knock-out\nsale at Sotheby\u2019s a year ago (even more\npoignant being that he made this astronomical sum the same week the fall\nof Lehman brothers signaled our descent into economic crisis). Yet apart\nfrom this market \u2018phenomenon\u2019, let us\ncall it, Hirst\u2019s work is still considered\nrather tame \u2013 not having the \u2018shock\u2019\nfactor. We all saw his pickled shark at\nthe Saatchi gallery.\nMy point is this; that although many\nof the artworks shocked even me, especially Jeff Koons\u2019 huge blown-up\nfantasy portraits of himself and porn-star La Cicciolina exposing orifice and\nmember to all and sundry, these artworks are now nearly 30 years old!\nDoes an exhibition such as Pop Life\nact as a retrospective for the era of\n\u2018look-at-me\u2019 art? Are we entering a new\nage of conservative art? Or will we be\nsubjected to a new wave of sensibility-insulting images and artworks?\nT\nhe Sixties was one of the\nmost riotous, exciting and\nrevered (at least from a\nhedonistic point of view)\ndecades of the century\ngone by: it is hard to refute this fact\nespecially when one can compare what\nhas gone before with the time in which\nthe youth of today is growing up. The\nworld was shaking off the frugality the\nwar had imposed and the progeny of\nthe May 1945 celebrations were at the\nhelm pioneering the expansion in mu-sic, fashion and more. It is little won-der, then, that the National Portrait\nGallery, like many before it, has tried\nto capture this exuberance.\nBeatles to Bowie travels chrono-logically, exploring the big bands, art-ists, models and hangers-on of each\nyear. Cabinets of \u2018artefacts\u2019 such as\nmagazine covers and record sleeves\npunctuate the portraits in an attempt\nto make the collection seem less like,\nwell, a one dimensional photograph.\nThe first few years of the decade plod\nthrough the early years of pop music as\nwe know it, filled with faces that few\nborn after 1960 would remember and\nfar too many of a chipmunk-faced Cliff\nRichard.\nIt is only after 1965 as the Beatles\nstarted gathering more and more momentum that the portraits become\nslightly more adventurous and it becomes harder to tell immediately they\nwere commissioned for the glossy pages of a magazine or Sunday newspaper supplement, as many were. Fiona\nAdam\u2019s portrait of the four members\nof Gerry and the Pacemakers in the\nprocess of sliding down a playground\nslide and the iconic Beatles-jumpingin-mid-air photograph leap out immediately on account of their playfulness\nand sense of spontaneity. Jean Marie\nle Perier also creates two atmospheric\nand eye catching Beatles portraits:\nthe four of them peering round their\nmanager Brian Epstein\u2019s red door and\nanother where they stand huddled,\nthe only light coming from matches\nused to light their cigarettes, bringing\nto mind the atmospheric lighting created in a renaissance painting. This\n\u2018old master\u2019 effect is recreated later by\nGered Mankowitz in his portrait of the\nSpencer David Group.\nBy the time 1966 comes around it\nis obvious the curator, Terence Pepper, has begun to try a bit harder. The\nportraits now come with a soundtrack\nof Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones and\nthe other usual suspects as well as\nsome unsightly mannequins clothed\nin the fashion of the day (mini dresses\nmainly). Here, not only does the music get better but the photographs do\ntoo, with a more portraits seeming less\nstaged.\nThorgerson/Hipgnosis\u2019 1969 photograph of Pink Floyd (used for the\n\u2018Ummagumma\u2019 album cover) is as off\nthe wall as its subjects\u2019 music. The\nfour band members are spread between a room and the garden it leads\ninto, with the picture on the wall in\nthe foreground a near mirror image of\nthe scene we see, only the band have\nswapped positions and attire. Bob Dylan trying on shoes in Carnaby Street\nand Donovan sat writing song lyrics on\nthe south bank with Big Ben a shadow\nin the background are more intimate\nofferings, as is Tom Blau\u2019s black and\nwhite triptych of John Lennon and\nYoko Ono going in for a kiss.\nThe gems of the collection only\nemerge in the later years of the decade,\na sign of the more exciting approach\nto photography (smearing Vaseline on\nthe camera lens) but also, perhaps, of\nthe more exciting times when groups\nsuch as the Jimi Hendrix Experience,\nLed Zeppelin and the Doors (surpris-ingly absent from this exhibition!)\nwere at the forefront of music and the\ndemure Fifties were a more distant\nmemory.\nThe baby boomers of the Forties\nwere now all young adults, and with\nsuch a high proportion of young people in the population it is not surprising that the second half of the Sixties\nbecame as exciting as it was. It may explain the insipid, bland youth culture\nand music present today in a rapidly\nageing population.\nBut there was not just only music and\nfashion, sex and acid during the Sixties\n(not for everyone, at least). There was\nalso political unrest, war and famine\nand it would be na\u00efve to only look at\nthe music in isolation as contemporary\ntimes will always have effect on artistic\noutput in any given era. After having\nbeen recently to the British Music Experience, which successfully includes\nmusic, paraphernalia and politics in\nan immersive environment, Beatles\nto Bowie seems haphazardly curated,\nmaking the decade seem hackneyed; a\nclich\u00e9 of itself.\nGodheads of the \u201860\u2019s\nCaz Knight reviews a thematic NPG show of rock and roll stars\nRosie Milton witnesses Pop Art\u2019s final flails at the Tate\nUntitled 2009 \u00a9 Maurizio Cattelan. This artwork acutely embodies a well-known phrase relevent for this exhibit\n\n"

Phases 1 & 2 have been relatively\ndull for the average student; phase 1 saw\na new lift and dodgy wiring being fixed\nin the union and phase 2 was responsible for the union offices and the student activities centre being moved up a\nfew floors and a new gym in the union.\nPhase 3 is set to be completed in time\nfor freshers week 2010 and includes\nmajor changes to the area dearest to\nstudents\u2019 hearts; the bar! The union bar\nis likely to be largely unchanged; neat-ening up the floor and ceiling as well as\ninstalling air conditioning.\nMeanwhile, Da Vinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s both\nlook set for a radical overhaul; regarding the current configuration of the\nbars Ashley told felix: \u201cThe problem\nwith da Vinci\u2019s is that it\u2019s just too nar-row, the lino floors are horrible and\nthe catering area is a complete waste\nof space in the evening, reducing the\nuseable length of the bar.\u201d When asked\nabout the furniture in da Vinci\u2019s, introduced in a minor refurbishment in\n2006, Ashley agreed they\u2019re not really\nfit for purpose and are far less robust\nthan hoped- the tendency for legs to\nfall off the tables isn\u2019t ideal. However\nhe maintained the considerations behind the furniture are still valid: \u201cfurniture in da Vinci\u2019s needs to be robust,\nperhaps the style should be more\nlike what\u2019s currently in dB\u2019s, but with\nlonger tables so that a whole team can\ngather around one and the furniture\nshould survive outside use, making the\nspace more flexible.\u201d One suggestion\nfor solving the problem of the unsociable shape of da Vinci\u2019s is to knock out\nthe current catering space changing\nthe configuration to increase efficiency\nand improve the layout of the bar.\nICU\u2019s \u2018club\u2019 dB\u2019s suffers from a poor\nlayout which makes it difficult to reach\nAlice Rowlands\nAlice Rowlands Reporter\nWe are looking for HAYFEVER sufferers and NORMAL\nVOLUNTEERS to help with allergy research\nIf you are interested in taking part in research to help us understand the causes of\nnasal allergies and develop new forms of treatment, and if\nyou are between 18 and 55 years old please contact us for more information:\na.goldstone@imperial.ac.uk\nAndrea Goldstone \u2013 Clinical Research Nurse\nDepartment of Allergy\nRoyal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust\nand NHLI Ethics Commitees\nFulham Road, London SW3 6HP\nThe research has been approved by the Brompton Harefield & NHLI Research Ethics Committee\nDamage to the Union over two weeks: 1. 1st Floor rear office doors, 2. dBs toilets, 3.

Miriam is 5ft 9in tall, of\nslim build with hazel eyes and shoulder\nlength brown hair. When last seen she\nwas wearing light colour jeans, a green-blue hooded jumper, trainers and a\nknee length beige corduroy coat She\nwas carrying a blue and beige material\nshoulder-bag.

As part of an effort to\nmake dB\u2019s a more inviting entertaining\nspace, the entire quad is likely to be remodelled and the popular awnings re-positioned in order to make better use\nof covered outside space.\nInitial plans for phase 3 were produced when work began in 2006, the\nUnion realise this refurbishment is a\nmassive undertaking which can only\nbe done every fifteen years or so it\u2019s\nessential to get it right. Temporary, ill-planned solutions have resulted in the\ncurrent poor use of space, so the Union are consulting professional designers and students on how best to use the\nspace.\nMajor work to da Vinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s will\nset the Union back around \u00a32 million,\nTuesdays meeting left Ashley confirmed the project will go ahead with\nfunds raised between College, Union\nreserves and a loan to the Union from\ncollege, meaning the Union are happy\npress ahead with plans for phase 3.\nExcitement over plans for phase\n3 has been somewhat soured by\nevening revelry resulting in around\n\u00a32000 worth of damage to the Union\nbuilding over the last two weeks. Last\nWednesday several panes of glass\nin ground floor doors and windows\nwere broken and a door to the Union offices was damaged, on Friday\nnight the door to the toilet in dB\u2019s\nwas pulled off its hinges and this\nWednesday a door near to the Ladies\ntoilets was damaged to the point that\nit will be completely replaced. Talking\nabout the recent damage, Ashley told\nfelix: \u201cGeneral wear and tear should\nbe expected but this much damage\nin a few days makes you wonder why\nwe bother, covering the cost of this\ndamage is equivalent to 10% on the\nprice of drinks.\u201dAcknowledging that\nthe damage is caused by a minority of\n\u2018drunk, stupid people\u2019, Ashley\u2019s message to students is: \u201cIf you see someone you know damaging Union prop-erty, tell them to pack it in!\u201d\n\n"

We pile a mountain of\nrain-soaked kit onto the pavement, including a skull dripping with wax and\na rolling pumpkin with a face only a\nmother could love. This wasn\u2019t the only\ncheesy song of the weekend, and my\nmind remains harrowed by memories\nof a Halloween in the Lake District that\nwill haunt me forever: think gay pirates\nin skin-tight pink V-necks, white lightening cider and a castle plunging into\ndarkness before you. Think a Fellwanderers\u2019 trip to a beautiful mountain\u2026\n11.00am Saturday: the valley floor\nswept out before us, over the rocky\nforeground a raging river chased the\npath down the mountainside back to\nthe pub where we began, and many\nmiles later would finish. Left, two\nsheep (with their picturesque blue\nspray-painted-on numbers) scampered past a dry stone wall. Right, an\neerie mist washed down over the land-scape, the peaks of the mountains lost\nin the clouds. The wall was wet from\nrain and the mist kept coming, so we\nkept going.\nThe day\u2019s conquest was the volcani-clastic sandstone summit of Bowfell,\n6th highest mountain in the Lakes. We\nwere in good hands: Alex our leader\nhad kicked off with a pint before departing from the Union and I picked\nup a bottle of white lightening cider\non our travels north. We arrived with\nall our kit rain-soaked on the top of\nthe bus at our exclusive residence (an\nageing village hall with an ominous\nportrait of some fat, old and now dead\nlady hanging above as we slept). Manpoints to Jim for sleeping in a half-soaked sleeping bag. The hall came\ncomplete with a classic record player\nand all those 80s hits on vinyl \u2013 sadly\nthese weren\u2019t played. What\u2019s more, I\nhad to settle for porridge for breakfast.\nI think you have problems if you like\nthis stuff.\nUp the valley, onto a plateau and past\na lake, up a bit more: some nice views,\nlots of mist and rain now, but rewarding all the same. We find the \u2018shelter\u2019\n(is it really a shelter if you can legally\nsmoke there? Two walls \u2013 is that a\nshelter?!) and enjoy our first lunch. A\nsmall patch of blue sky emerges later\nand we all take pictures. After a small\nmap-reading error, we plough on, only\nto confront our worst nightmare \u2013 the\nother half of the trip emerge from the\nmist (we had split into two groups doing the same circular walk in opposite\ndirections)! a Tolkien-style troll battle\nensued. Later in the afternoon we hit\nthe summit and bash on down to the\npub which, quite frankly, was a little\ndisappointing \u2013 it had strip lights and\nred vinyl flooring (but no, not a strip\nclub) \u2013 not your classic English watering hole. Still, following a plastered\nlocal home because he couldn\u2019t bring\nhimself to drive above 25mph (60mph\nlimit) was entertaining, but not as\nmuch as was what lay ahead\u2026\nAt the hut, butternut squash chop-ping. Too much squash. But it went\ninto a tasty pumpkin risotto and pumpkin pie for dessert, all very Halloweentastic. The connoisseurs amongst us\nenjoyed our food with a tasty glass of\nFrosty Jacks while some of the plebians\nsettled for fine wine and real ale. Then\nthere\u2019s the one who always goes too far:\nfor full appreciation, try the recipe at\nhome: 1) take a half pint of white lightening cider. 2) to the glass, add a brown\nsugar frosting to the rim, and dress\nwith wedges of pumpkin and apple. 3)\nheat in the microwave for two minutes.\n4) light a candle and float this in the\ndrink \u2013 now enjoy your tasty, steaming beverage, just like mulled wine and\nrat\u2019s piss with a rotten cabbage thrown\nin. Yummy!\nThe merriment continued with folk\ndonning their costumes: Scream was\nin attendance, a gay pirate, a bat and\na vampire. An El Presidentes pumpkin\ncarving contest was hacked out on the\nstage (Chris should never be trusted\nwith a knife like this again) and then\ncandles were lit and the lights turned\nout. This was the ideal time to touch\nup freshers.\nIn a Fellwandering frenzy we embarked on a midnight walk to the local\nWray Castle, carrying a sheep\u2019s skull\nmounted on a stick and two lit pump-kins. The beautiful stone gothic building was illuminated in a deep orange\nglow, towering over us. Until, without\nwarning, darkness instantaneously enveloped us. Fearing we had upset the\ngods, we marched back to the hall for a\nnecessitated night\u2019s sleep. No one will\never know what caused the castle to\nvanish into darkness like that\u2026\nSunday morning, pissing down,\ndrank too much cider. Shit, there\u2019s a\nslice of pumpkin pie in the oven still!\nMmmm, oh that\u2019s good. And in the\ndoor of the bus, oh yes, my chips left\nover from Friday night. Tasty. None of\nthat porridge for me.\nAn aqua-bus journey along roads\nthat have become rivers, past fields\nthat have become lakes, and we found\nourselves in Conniston. There was a\nchoice of three options here, each more\nnonsensical than the last: stay in the\npub all day, take a short walk around\nthe lake and pub lunch, or go for a long\nwalk up a mountain in the rain to see\na \u2018Goat\u2019s puddle\u2019. For the benefit of the\nclub, contrary to what any forecaster\nmay have told you, I can assure you we\nenjoyed blue skies and sunshine all day,\nwith panoramic views of jaw-dropping\nscenery. We were bounding like lambs\nover heather.\nWe returned to the buses, reluctant\nto leave. Still, I knew I would fall asleep\nand wake up in London a little later.\nLet\u2019s just forget about the road works\nand heavy traffic because of stupid\ncars full of stupid kids at the end of half\nterm, and the service station dinner\n(KFC/salty soup/expensive sandwiches/Friday\u2019s chips re-heated).\nLate at night \u2013 when only those of\nyou who got bladdered for the entire\nweekend and could no longer move remain at the Union \u2013 we return: more\nmountains conquered, more classic\ndishes served up, many more cheesy\nsongs, countless laughs and dozens of\nheroic tales to tell. We returned home\nlooking on the brighter side of life!\nmost 50% of our population choose to\ndo).\nIn 1988, a group of students in Burma protested against their military\nregime where freedom of speech was\nforcibly repressed. The government\u2019s\nresponse was to arrest, kill and \u2018disappear\u2019 thousands of people. Their crime\nwas breaking one of Burma\u2019s most ridiculous sounding laws; disturbing\npublic tranquillity. Other banned activities in Burma include; gatherings\nof five or more people, discussing fuel\nprices, politics, religion, foreign affairs,\npeacocks or the colour red.\nThe internet is restricted by government censorship and you can get\narrested for accessing BBC pages,\nAmnesty International information\nor other outside literature. When the\nfreedoms of a people are restricted, it\nis the duty of others to use theirs.\nIn August and September 2007,\nmembers of the original \u201988 group,\nincluding veteran activists Htay Kywe\nand Mie Mie and a younger member,\nZaw Htet Ko Ko, took part in mass\nanti-government protests which swept\nthrough Burma. These much publicized events (in the UK at least) were\nbrought to an unceremonious end by a\nviolent crackdown by the military jun-The Amnesty Column - this Newspaper could get you arrested\nta. Htay Kywe, Mie Mie and Zaw Htet\nKo Ko were arrested in October. Htay\nKywe and Mie Mie were sentenced to\n65 years in prison and Zaw Htet Ko Ko\nreceived an 11-year sentence.\nAs a human rights charity, Amnesty\nInternational campaigns for the unconditional release of these prisoners\nof conscience. Not only horrified by the\nviolation of some of the most basic of\nhuman rights (freedom of speech and\nfreedom of assembly), mistreatment of\nprisoners is also a concern. Since 1988,\nat least 135 political prisoners have\ndied either in prison or during inter-rogations. Past prisoners report police\nbrutality, the use of shackles and other\nmistreatments.\nAs a group, the Amnesty International Society have signed the petition\nfor the release of Htay Kywe, Mie Mie ,\nZaw Htet Ko Ko and all other Burmese\nprisoners of conscience. But there\u2019s\nmore than just that; our society is dedicated to informing ourselves and others of human rights violations around\nthe world, including in the UK.\nSo if you see us around campus do\ncome over, ask questions and read our\npetitions.

She exhibited her latest Spring Summer 2010\ncollection at the Somerset House during London Fashion Week and will\ncontinue to do so this Feburary for her\nAW10 designs.\nThe Scottish designer is a graduate\nfrom Central Saint Martins. She worked\nfor Osman Yousefzada before setting up\nher own label.\nKawaiWong\nKawaiWong Fashion Editor\nDesigner Profiles\nThe softly spoken designer creates\nfrom her studio in the Highlands of Scotland. The Scot uses Scottish fabric and\naims to be as sustainable as possible. She\nis inspired by the legendary Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli. Henrietta views\nfashion as a type of architecture and\nbelieves that clothing should be closely\nconnected to the frame of the body.\nHer classic sexy numbers feature futuristic rims on the sleeves reinforced\nby flexible tubings. Her dresses are a\npleasure to touch. The fabric feels like\na hybrid of spandex and silk. The dress\nsits nicely on the body, maximising the\nwomanly curves. The nice sheen of the\ndress gives off a power-woman touch \u2013 a\nnice balance of femininity and feminism.\nBespoke couture appointments are\navailable with Henrietta at her London\nshow room on Exeter Street.\nFor more details and stockists, visit\nwww.henriettaludgate.com\nHenrietta Ludgate in her own SS10 design at an Estethica event\nThe woven logo on Stamo\u2019s clothes tag\nated pink bow extending all the way\nfrom the waist down to the ankles.

Wear this inside and\nyou\u2019ll get a normal looking winter coat\nwith ruffle trimmings at the opening.\nWear this outside and it looks like an\noversized, romanticised poncho.\nStamo\u2019s ethos is that she tries to produce the garments in the same region\nas they will be sold so that she gives\nback to the community as much as she\ntakes. She also works with crafts that\nare dying, for example hand pleating.\nShe is interested in preserving them as\npart of our international heritage and\nculture.\nPerhaps it\u2019s a Greek thing. She is definitely not as fearful as I imagined her\nto be. If anything, she is the complete\nopposite. She always ends her emails\nwarmly with \u201cWishing you a lovely\nday.\u201d\nFor details and stockists, visit www.\nstamo.co.uk.

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 20 NOVEMBER 2009\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nProactive approach needed on climate\nEveryone knows about climate change.\nIts buzz words: carbon footprint,\ngreenhouse emissions etc. Its endless\ndocumentaries, books, songs and constant pleas from celebrities. But, what\nare we going to do about it?\nThere are enough people out there in\nthe public arena that are all talk and no\naction; most celebrity endorsements\nare so hypocritical they\u2019re insulting. In\na nutshell, their antics go something\nlike this: find cause which is poignant\nand mindlessly gut wrenching. Attract\nhuge amount of publicity visiting indigenous people and pretending to talk\nto tribesmen (plenty of time for a photo shoot); then fly back home first class\non a greenhouse-gas-spewing nightmare of a plane. Arrive home; next\nday do a circuit of all the daytime TV\nshows showing lots of emotion over\nthe subject matter, and plug an album.\nThat is a pretty cynical view, I know,\nbut I am sure the celebs care about\ntheir causes, but what I find so stupid and inconsiderate on their part, is\nthe fact that they then expect us, the\ngeneral public, to down tools and get\nto work ensuring their futile vision of\na harmonious and peaceful world will\ncome to fruition. When actually, funnily enough, we don\u2019t have the same\nendless pots of gold as a multi-plati-num recording artist or a jumped-up\nmodel that suddenly cares about things\nthat the general populous cares about,\njust after they\u2019ve been grappling with\nthe tabloids over a nasty and twisted\ndivorce. The general public have much\nmore important things to spend their\nprecious hard earned cash on, and\nthere are so many important causes\nout there, ordinary people just don\u2019t\nhave the resources, and when these\npretentious climate messiahs tell us\nmortals to do this and that it just guilts\nus into feeling bad that we not billionaire philanthropists.\nProtesters and dreamers at hippy\ngatherings of climate camp are preaching more about prudence and an end\nto the consumer agenda, than actually about climate change. They want\na change in the way people live their\nlives, and that is a far greater ask.\nThis is a far too much of a political\nagenda, and almost bordering on a new\nreligious ideology. Again, just making\neveryone else feel bad. The solution of\nclimate change will come from scientists and if they want to help instead\nof camping in inconvenient places in\nLondon; play the system, lobby, drum\nup public support for ideas that will really make a difference.\nWhat is needed is not to concentrate\non the emotive side of the problem,\nmore the rational solutions.\nClimate change in the media is bandied around so much, but how many\npeople actually know the science behind it? To your average Joe, and your\nGucci wearing hippy of a celebrity this\nprobably doesn\u2019t matter, but it should.\nArming people with a knowledge of\nhow and why the climate is changing\nand the technical side of the solutions,\nwould do more for climate change than\ntrying to force people\u2019s opinions with\ninaccurate shock therapy on TV. With\nsome basic science, public opinion\nwould be much more tailored to what\nwas needed to combat climate change,\nand this would get the ball rolling much\nfaster as to what is needed to solve this\ngigantic pain in the arse.\nMaybe stuck-up seaside residents\nwould then be far less hypocritical\nRichard Howard\nRichard Howard\nContinued polution at current levels will lead to a 6o\nC rise in global temperaures say the Global Carbon Project this week\nwhen campaigning against the construction of wind farms because it will\nruin their view, while still wanting at\nthe same time to save the earth. Or\npressurising the people that matter to\ninvest vast sums in relevant technology\n(but nothing in comparison to a bail-out), like fusion power for example.\nMy point is that we need to be\nmore proactive in our quest for\nchange, and in possession of knowledge we can look to a brighter future,\ninstead of the frightening one that is\nportrayed in the public domain.\nBerlusconi\u2019s widespread corruption in Italian politics\nThere once was a king who very much\nenjoyed his reign. He got impunity\nfrom the law, a different damsel in\nhis bedroom every night and no one\ncould do anything about it, not even\ncomplain. You could be forgiven to\nthink that I\u2019m talking about some feudal lord of the Middle Ages, but for\nthe citizens of a certain country in\nsouthern Europe, this is reality. Welcome to Italy, where the third-richest\nman holds the reins of power, the director of the foremost public news\nprogram refuses to air news criticising him and five out of six television\nchannels, the most used media by the\nmajority of Italians, are under control\nof the government.\nBerlusconi represents the perfect\npolitician, the union of resources, an\nexcellent understanding of what appeals to people and enough boldness\nto ignore reality. His control of the\nmedia has allowed him to demonize\nhis opponents and spread his slogan\nof \u201cless taxes for everybody\u201d, a strategy that has allowed him to get elected\nthree times in the past twenty years.\nTo his credit, he has kept that promise,\ndespite crippling the economy in order\nto make up for the tax cuts that benefitted mostly only the ultra-rich. The\nsensible laws however, or indeed any\nlaw that pertained to the country, were\nsubmerged by a sea of acts that had as\ntheir only purpose to take him out of\nhis legal troubles. Berlusconi is a man\nwith many ongoing trials against him,\nmainly concerning shady takeovers of\ncompanies, illegal handling of wealth\nand suspect mafia connections. His\nfirst priority once in power has always\nbeen to protect himself and his friends\nby decriminalising whatever they were\naccused of, by making them immune\nfrom the law and restricting the powers of the magistrates. His latest attempt to make himself untouchable\nhas been declared unconstitutional by\nthe Italian Supreme Court: no more\nthan a mere speed bump in his run, as\nhe is already pushing another law that\nwould cause all the trials against him\nto expire.\nThe question is why the Italian public keeps voting for him. One could\nblame the media, which conveniently\nhides or downplays all the ad person-am laws, trumpets triumphantly anything else he does and rabidly attacks\nanyone who criticises him. One could\nalso blame the lack of alternatives,\nas the Italian left is lethargic, divided\nand trying to be too clever for its own\ngood. The right-wing parties show\nmuch more loyalty to their bosses and\nmuch less squabbling over inanities.\nThis allows them to quickly pass laws\nin parliament \u2013 never mind that they\nare actively bad or useless for the coun-try, at least they are doing something\n\u2013 the Italian public thinks. But the far\nmore sinister option is that Italians, in\ntheir hearts, want to be like Berlusconi.\nThey want to be charming, successful\nmen who accumulate masses of wealth\nand sleep with beautiful women, who\nonly care for their own good and are\nnot afraid to resort to illegal means if it\nmakes them richer. They want to own\nfootball clubs, evade taxes and promote family values, despite sleeping\nwith prostitutes.\nMaybe this has become a little more\nof a rant than intended (although everything I\u2019ve said is true; you can check\nthe work of many independent journalists such as Travaglio and Santoro\nto prove this), and maybe you already\nknew all of this, or maybe you don\u2019t\ncare about any of it. Probably what I\u2019m\ntrying to say is that if you think that\nthis country\u2019s got it bad, with neo-Nazis on public television and hardly\nany alternatives to the two very similar\nmain parties, it could be worse. At least\nyou don\u2019t come from a country where\npeople are at best blind, or in the worst\ncase, tax evaders and Casanovas.\nPietro Aronica\nPietro Aronica\nBerlusconi with his new barbershop quartet: Obama, Medvedev and Hu Jintao\n\n"

The Beat\nGeneration was a group of American\nwriters in the 1950s. They rejected\nAmerican values, society\u2019s values and\nlived the spontaneous life of doing\nwhatever they wanted, whenever they\nwanted and liberating themselves. A\nlife of non-conformity in order for\npure expression to be achieved.\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious the 1950s were\na serious turning point on the road\nthat music was to take. At that time,\njazz and swing was breaking out of\nthe previously \u2018normal\u2019 music style\nand the Beat Generation had a lot to\ndo with that. Whether they knew the\nsignificance of their actions or not, this\ngeneration had set music down a road\nwhich would encounter The Beatles,\nBob Dylan and The Doors. It can be\nsaid that Beatniks were a cause of the\nhippie revolution (in my thinking,\nwe\u2019re on the brink of another hippie\nmovement. Anyone?). They were true\nbohemians.\nJack Kerouac\u2019s writings in \u2018On The\nRoad\u2019 and Allen Ginsberg\u2019s \u2018Howl\u2019 are\ntwo books that inspired The Beat Generation to spread. Jack Kerouac being\nthe one who introduced the term Beat\nGeneration.\nIn the end music is a form of poetry,\nwith or without lyrics, and the Beatniks\u2019 poetry was genius. It went against\nconformity in a simple way, it was dif-ferent. Allen Ginsberg: \u201cThe only thing\nthat can save the world is the reclaiming of the awareness of the world.\nThat\u2019s what poetry does.\u201d He really\nbelieved in what he was saying. Once\nThe Beat Generation had grown roots,\nthey began to put their poems to music :soft, quiet, jazzy background accompaniments to poems. Sometimes\nBeatnik music was stripped down to a\nsimple poem and beat.\nWhatever they did, they did well.\nHaving a big influence on rock and roll\nof the 1960s until today- Bob Dylan being one of the better-known Beatniks,\nbut others were members of the acid-loving Merry Pranksters in the 1960s,\nwhich brought us The Grateful Dead.\nSome inspired The Clash, The Doors,\nThe Rolling Stones and Lou Reed. The\nBeat seed had been planted and look at\nthe road it\u2019s taken us on, not bad at all.\nReviews\nThis album is full of catchy melodies\nand pleasant guitar sounds. But there\u2019s\na huge contrast in styles throughout the\nalbum, as if there was more than one\nband in here. The lyrics are try-hard\nemo, and the sound never breaks out\nof being conventional. Not much that\nhasn\u2019t been heard before. That said, it\ndoes sound nice... - Luke Turner\nThis sentimental ballad would be very\nfitting in the middle of a dramatic\nscene of Grey\u2019s Anatomy, or another\nsuch TV series- it wouldn\u2019t sound bad\nif a tactfully chosen snippet was to\nplay on-screen, but upon one full lis-ten, the song surfaces full of dreamy,\nsoppy, \u201cindie-folk\u201d crooning. It was\nmade to be background music: the\ndynamics are flat, and even with high\nstrings trailing in and out on top of the\nsimplistic piano motif, there is no real\nassertive melody. Tom Hull\u2019s voice is\ntoo weak to enhance this piece of mu-sic, being quite nasal, and the instrumental ending is bland and stylistically\nunimpressive, wrapping up a song that\nhas been written following the ballad\nformula, but lacking in true emotion.\n- Joanna Cai\nKID HARPOON\nONCE\nYOUNG TURKS\nSINGLE\nThis second album from Alberta Cross\nis overpowering. It is amazing, with\nbrooding blues and the pure power of\nemotion. The vocals being exceptional\nin some parts and the music impas-sioned. This is beautiful rock, full of\nsoul, from a band that will undoubtedly inspire many. - Luke Turner\nALBERTA CROSS\nBROKEN SIDE OF\nTIME\nARK RECORDINGS\nALBUM\n1997\nNOTES FROM\nUNDERGROUND\nVICTORY\nRECORDINGS\nALBUM\nfelix charts: Imperial\u2019s\nfavourite artists!\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\nBiffy Clyro\nMuse\nRadiohead\nJay-Z\nKings of Leon\nSonic Youth\nThe xx\nYeah Yeah Yeahs\nAnimal Collective\nRed Hot Chilli Peppers\nTo rebel! That is the\nimmediate objective of\npoets\nLuke Turner\nLuke Turner Music Editor\nThis track commands attention from\nthe outset by the use of discorded guitar arrangements, which remain effective until the vocals begin in the lazy,\nslurring style so often adopted amongst\nvocalists today. The layering of multiple guitars on top of a simple yet thunderous drum creates an atmosphere of\ntension and urgency which is relieved\nat the chorus. However, this musical\nstructure is used and reused soon becoming very predictable; perhaps as\npop music should be. -Joanna Cai\nREGARDS\nAFTER MANY A\nSUMMER\nSINGLE\nFor some this will sound like the equivalent of musical diarrhoea. But for fans\nof lo-fi noise-rock in the vein of Times\nNew Viking and Wavves, this is a glorious piece of work. The third LP from\nthis London-based band isn\u2019t easy on\nthe ear, featuring heavily saturated\nguitars and incomprehensible scream-ing. But there are inspired moments\nthroughout: flirting with doom-metal\nand stoner-rock. On a whole, it\u2019s an\nabrasive, messy success. -Greg Power\nTODD\nBIG RIPPER\nROUGH TRADE\nALBUM\nONLINE\nFELIXMUSIC.TK\nMuse live at the\nO2 arena\nInterview with\nSouls Of Mischief\nFilthy Dukes\u2019\nbrand new single\nAlice in Chains live\nat HMV forum\nA Welsh \u201cgoth\u201d-rock trio consisting\nof two brothers on guitar/drums and\ntheir sister Hannah on the bass.

It\u2019s a shame similar neat tricks can\u2019t be used to write a screenplay.\nSpecial effects & a whole load of clich\u00e9s\nIt has to be said that the director, Roland Emmerich, has done a fantastic (albeit ridiculous) job of the latest\nHollywood \u2018end of the world\u2019 movie.\nThe stunning CGI and special effects\npushed the estimated cost of the film\nto a cool \u00a3120M, and has already raked\nin \u00a339M globally in its first week. That\nsaid, this is the director of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow,\nand nobody would have expected him\nto be conservative in his budgeting.\nSo, why are we all going to die this\ntime? Well, to be brief, solar flares are\nbombarding the earth with neutrinos\nand are heating the earth\u2019s core and\n\u2018cement\u2019 (as it\u2019s described) by a microwave effect. This cement no longer\nholds the tectonic plates in place, causing massive earthquakes, movement\nand breaking up of land mass. I\u2019m quite\nsure that there will be several physicists\ndisputing the cause of the disasters.\nThe all too familiar multiple narrative scenario from Emmerich presents\nthe disasters from different people,\nwho eventually connect, but the storyline itself is simply awful. The entire\nmovie is basically a string of horrific\ndisasters, one of which being California disappearing into the sea.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, this\nmovie is thoroughly entertaining on\nthe basis of the jaw-dropping special\neffects. The first ten minutes or so of\nthe film are not particularly fast-paced,\nuntil it suddenly jumps into the California disaster. You will definitely sit\nthere in awe of the collapsing skyscrap-ers, and of the volcanic eruption of Yellowstone, hence the massive portion of\nthe budget spent on CGI.\nYou\u2019re probably now wondering why\nI think the storyline is terrible, the answer is simple\u2026 clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9, and oh\nyes, a few more clich\u00e9s. Examples of\nthese would be the man who falls off\na cliff and everyone thinks he\u2019s dead\nuntil his hand appears from over the\nedge (copied from Indiana Jones); or\nthe man with a few hours\u2019 flying experience who has to pilot a ridiculously\nNo point going green this week really, according to the latest Emmerich blockbuster film 2012 the fatal blow to\nour planet will be served by neutrinos and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. So sit back and watch with joy.\nlarge jet to safety (take your pick from\nany airplane disaster movie, how about\nAir Force One?) and the underwater escape scene at the end. The list goes on\nand on.\nNow back to the good parts. Yes, it\u2019s\nan end of the world disaster movie, but\nthere are some laughs in there. However, I\u2019m not too sure they\u2019re intentional.\nLook out for the Russian man falling\ndown a precipice near the end of the\nTheir very own Personal Jesus...\nI like Depeche Mode. I don\u2019t like\ndrawing pictures imagining myself\nmarried to the band members. Some\npeople like both. The Posters Came\nFrom The Walls taught me this and a\nwhole host of mainly bizarre Depeche\nMode fan anecdotes, yet amongst the\nweird and the peculiar on offer, I left\nthe screening with a much greater admiration for fandom in general. The\nfilm is an interview-based documentary surrounding fans of Depeche\nMode worldwide. Directors Nicholas Abrahams and Jeremy Deller zip\naround the world as if it were a high\noctane action film.\nFrom Basildon to California to Saint\nPetersburg, I often expected the next\nshot to be of a bearded Russian general urgently making a call, ordering the execution of some nefarious\nscheme surrounding the band, while\nsimultaneously pouring himself a glass\nof the people\u2019s finest fermented pota-toes. With a little effort I was able to\nsnap out of this political thriller mindset and put my documentary hat on\n(which I must admit, doesn\u2019t happen\ntoo often). What I found though, in\nlieu of the usual multiplex releases that\nI am so very fond of, was a truly genuine and, in some ways life affirming,\ndocumentary.\nWhile Depeche Mode is at the crux\nof the issues of the film, the true message is that of the extremes of fandom\nand the positive and negative effects of\nit. Interviews are held with people who\nhave in some way been significantly affected by their love of Depeche Mode.\nThe types of their stories are balanced fantastically throughout. High\ndrama stems from the Russians who\nsee the group\u2019s music as a soundtrack\nto the political upheaval that occurred\nduring the late eighties and early nineties \u2013 with a timely reminder of the fall\nJoshPear\nJoshPear\nMatthewColvin\nMatthewColvin\nfilm; the noise he made had the whole\ntheatre laughing at what was intended\nto be quite a sad moment!\nThe part of the film that I really like is\nafter all the destruction and loss, there\nis that \u2018everything will be OK\u2019 sense at\nthe end. All the characters seem to ignore the fact that nearly 6 billion people are dead. But this is fine, as they\u2019re\nheading for the new Africa.\nBottom line is, the storyline is dread-ful, but is totally and utterly dwarfed\nby the outstanding special effects, I\npersonally like the 1500m tsunami\nhurtling over the Himalayas. There is\na scene, which you can watch online by\ntyping \u20182012 scene\u2019 into youtube. On\nthat basis, I would recommend that\nyou should go and see it, even if it is\nfor a laugh. Had this film not devoted\nso much to the special effects, it would\nhave had 1 star.\nof the Berlin Wall. Comedy is found\nwith the German family whose hobby\nis to re-enact music videos. The sight\nof trumpeters performing a routine to\n\u2018Personal Jesus\u2019 simply has to be seen\nto be believed.\nThese fans seem contented and despite their struggles, political or oth-erwise, their association with the band\nhas had a small negative and detrimental impact.\nA fan even talks breathlessly and\nwith enthusiasm of a near riot in Los\nAngeles. But then, I thought that this\nwas perhaps the point. An underlying\ntheme present through many of the\nstories was the betterment of the people concerned and the overcoming of\nproblems. People had been brought\ntogether and found purpose in their\nown lives through this joint love for\nmusic.\nThe film goes on a very limited one-day release on December 1st and will\nbe out on DVD in Spring 2010, but if\nyou do find the opportunity to go and\nsee it, take it. Next time I hear some\nDepeche Mode, I won\u2019t go to the extreme of some fans and apply some definitively eighties make up, but I will be\nreminded of how much of a difference\npeople can make when they are truly\ninspired.\n\n"

However, rumours had been circulating before these\nannouncements, with the TimesHigherEducation tweeting on the morning of\nFriday 13th November: \u201cBig announcement from Imperial College due on Monday. Rumour mill in overdrive\u2026\u201d\nSir Roy recently cancelled his monthly\nmeeting with Union President Ashley\nBrown on the 9th November as well\nas an interview with felix on the 2nd\nNovember.\nOn the same day that the Rector cancelled his meeting with the Union President, 9th November, a session of College\nCouncil was held. Union President Ashley Brown explained \u201cThe President is\ninvited to attend all sessions of College\nCouncil except when staffing matters are\nbeing discussed, and I wasn\u2019t invited to\nthat meeting\u201d.\nThe College have confirmed that the\nCouncil were notified on the 2nd November before he officially tendered his\nresignation on the 9th, when the \u2018staffing\nmatters\u2019 were being discussed at Council.\nCollege officials have also stated Head\nof Departments were notified by Faculty\nPrincipals as late as the day before Monday the 16th.\nSir Roy will formally leave his post\non the 31st of December and Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions will take up the position until a new Rector is found. However, Sir\nRoy\u2019s day-to-day duties at Imperial are\nexpected to be scaled back with the recently appointed Deputy Rector, Professor Stephen Richardson picking up some\nof the slack. \u201cI do expect to be busy as Sir\nRoy winds down at the end of this year\nand prepares to hand over to Sir Keith but\nbeing busy is just part of an academic ca-reer... and I\u2019m looking forward to getting\nstuck in\u201d he told felix. The promotion of\nProfessor Richardson, reported in last\nweek\u2019s felix, was seen as a strong hint of\nSir Roy\u2019s imminent resignation.\nThe impact of Sir Roy\u2019s sudden resignation is likely to become more apparent\nover the coming weeks but it\u2019ll do little\nto help push forward Imperial\u2019s many ini-tiatives. \u201cThere\u2019s a long list of things that\nneed attention, which is going to be more\ndifficult now. I can\u2019t see there being much\nprogress between now and December,\u201d\nsays Ashley Brown.\nBrown also indicated that he doesn\u2019t\nexpect to be dealing with the outgoing\nRector, but rather with Prof. Richardson\nuntil Sir Keith O\u2019Nions arrives in January.

It has resulted\nin many rumours circulating around\nCollege regarding the Rector\u2019s departure.\nIt is clear that his explanation for leaving-wanting to focus more on research- has\nconvinced few people at Imperial. The\nrumours largely stem from the Rector\u2019s\nshort time on the job and the fact that he\nhad continued to advise the government\nand get involved in research during his\ntime as Rector. Some believe that he was\nunable to push forward his vision for the\nuniversity, and there are signs that Sir Roy\nand Lord Kerr had disagreed on a range\nof issues including Imperial\u2019s response\nfor cuts in public funding.\nSome have even suggested that he\nis leaving in order to distance himself\nfrom the staff cuts in Humanities and\nMedicine departments. University and\nCollege Union, who represent a portion of teaching staff at Imperial, stated\nthat \u2018We hope that Sir Roy Anderson\u2019s\nreplacement will use the opportunity\nof coming to a new role to look again at\nplans for serious and damaging cuts.

The search for a rector usually\nbegins around 10 months before the end\nof the incumbent\u2019s contract; obviously\nin this case, there has been significantly\nless advance warning.

True\nto my nature, I didn\u2019t allow the geological\nbantering linger and switched the conversation into travelling mode.\nAnd so he told me about his fleeting employment under the Sudanese\ngovernment.\nI could see the remorse in his eyes \u2013\nhe had a good reason to feel no pride in\nthis affiliation. He did redeem himself,\nand indeed his soul, when he declined to\nwork on a controversial project, conducted by a controversial company of a nation\nbrimming with ethical controversies.\nAll whilst Kelson the guide had the\nchicken knocked out stone cold, restrained and plucked, before I was handed a machete and committed the act of\nmurder.\n*\nThe sight aroused some disgust in Anna\u2019s\nfacial expressions, though I was brimming with childlike awe.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I pressed on. The Moroccan seemed patient \u2013 more due to\nhard-learnt marketing techniques rather\nthan the genuine wish to educate a couple of foreigners.\n\u201cSheep\u2019s head,\u201d he muttered as he\ndeboned the skull of one and mutilated\nit beyond recognition. Oddly, in its more\npassable manifestation, my appetite\nswelled. So I sat down, Anna by my side\nexpressing her indifference yet eagerness to try, and the stewed meat landed\nin our bowls effortlessly on our part, save\nthe odd afak and shukran to show our\ngratitude.\nExcept for being a bit greasy with a tad\ntoo much fat slithering on my tongue,\nI thought it tasted not bad at all. The\naroma, which scented the four corners of\nDjemaa el Fna \u2012 the evening food market\nof Marrakech \u2012 was an absolute bonus. I\ndidn\u2019t know, until then, that a cut considered waste product back home had such\ncapacity to satisfy even a strict palate like\nmine.\n(Though, on a side note, British manufacturers are known to include cheeks\nor even the entire head of cattle in the\nindustrial production of beef burgers \u2013\nwatch out the next time you order one at\nyour local kebab shop.)\nWe have fallen in touch with what\nwe eat. It is evidently so when our meat\ncomes in plastic wrappings and packag-ing, plucked straight from the shelves of\nTesco, and when recent studies show that\nan overwhelming population of children\nin London have not even the faintest idea\nof what an onion looks like.\nAnd too many times I have seen tourists give the grimace and decline the\ninvitation to try something different. In\nfact, refusal is a better phrase to describe\ntheir methods of dodging the \u2018awkward\u2019\nsituations; very often not so much a slab\nof kangaroo on the plate, or kava in coconut bowl, but familiar culinary ideas that\nwere managed by the hands of a foreign\nchef.\nTravelling opened my eyes to the\nnature-conjunct cuisines that a city\nlife would have me blinded to. Venison\nreared in grasslands, gigantic turkeys\nowned by the Strawbridge family of It\u2019s\nNot Easy Being Green fame, metre-long\nfish heaved from the Fijian seas, solitary\npineapples from the trees and sweet potatoes from the ground \u2013 none of these\nwere sheer impulses to consume but instead my utmost respect for the natural\nform of my foodstuff.\nAnd so, from Cornwall to New Zealand, from Morocco to the South Pacific,\nI found in my sources of food the means\nto rediscover the essentials of life I had\nlost touch with.\n*\nThe presentation had me digging deep\ninto reminiscence. I knew, as soon as I\ntook on the stage, the stories and photographic memoirs would have me overburdened with nostalgia for an adventure\nlost. At least, I consoled myself, I was\nthere to share them with a group of travel\nenthusiasts who would likely themselves\nembark on the hitch-hike from London\nto Morocco.\nAnd since minimal preparation was\nmade on the night before \u2013 the PowerPoint presentation consisted of no more\nthan ten pictures and my notes pretty\nobsolete \u2013 I embraced the role with\nfull commitment to improvisation. Or\nramblings.\n\u2018Why hitchhiking?\u2019 is next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, exciting, unpredictable; you\nget to meet people along the way\u2026\u201d\nI tried to be as persuasive as I could,\nthough the list of justification was running dry fast.\nBetter think of something equally as\nfast.\nThe sparkle of inspiration was as ingenious as the charity hitchhike itself.\n\u201cFor the eco-warriors amongst you,\nthink about the eco-initiative of the hitch:\nnot only will you be leaving behind zero\ncarbon emissions by travelling to your\nholiday destination by using alternative\ntransport, you\u2019re effectively reducing the\ncarbon footprints of those who give you\nlifts.\u201d\nAlthough, I must confessed, I had bol-locked my way out of embarrassment\nusing \u2018facts\u2019 I improvised on the spot,\nthere is still truth in my claims. You are\nreducing your carbon footprint by not\ntravelling by air, and you are dividing the\ncarbon emissions of a vehicle amongst\nthe drivers and his/her new-found pas-sengers, therefore yet another reduction.\nAnd so I questioned: considering our\nimpact to the environment by the simple\nacts of voyaging, should we travel less, if\nnot stop travelling altogether?\nAm I to be deprived of my rights to\nachieve better understanding of cultures\nand nature? Surely my motivations are\nmore noble than those whose sole purposes of travelling are to get plastered on\nyet another party island, or absent-mind-edly peruse yet another museum?\nPerhaps selfishness got the better of\nme.\nAlternative means of transport are\nbecoming increasing popular due to the\nraised awareness for the environment.\nBut, not disimilar to my hitchhiking\nstunt, they remain exclusive to those with\ntime in their hands.\nWill I spare months of my time, travelling over land and sea, to reach home\nsome 23,000 miles away, just because my\nconscience dictates so?\nNot a chance.\nFace it. Eco-tourism has never been about\nlabels and marketing strategies, vanity-driven self-righteous \u2018commitments\u2019 to\nconservation or CV boosters. Fire away\nyour accusations of idealism and impracticality \u2013 I am shameless to admit them\nall. But, I have gradually come to an understanding through travelling of the\nenvironment and the impacts of our acts\nof greed and ignorance. Eco-tourism can\nonly be so when the people affiliated to\nthe trend are receptive to their surroundings as they travel, yearn to learn the essentials of life in relations to the environ-ment, muse about the impact inflicted\nby their pursuit of knowledge, and can\nreturn from their journeys and continue\nto live out the lessons and inspire others\nto do the same.\nAnd so with these I shall leave you, dear\nreaders, the stories of \u2018me\u2019.\nEarly stages of growth of a mango...you don\u2019t learn that at school do you?\nOur victim in its final moments Alternative modes of transport\n\n"

But you'd be wrong. What\nabout clothes? Sorry, synthetic fibres\nare out (made directly from oil) and\nnatural ones come from plants farmed\nusing tractors (running on oil). That\napple in the bowl? Unless you picked it\nyourself from a local tree, it's probably\nbeen doused with pesticides (produced\nfrom oil) and shipped to you in a lorry\n(running on oil).\nContents of your bathroom? Almost\nall oil-derived. As are detergents, glue,\npaint, medicines, make-up, insulation,\ncarpet, agricultural fertilisers and most\nforms of packaging. We also rely on oil\nin the form of petrol, diesel and jet fuel\nto transport ourselves and our food\nand goods from place to place, and\non oil along with other fossil fuels to\nproduce our electricity. Our economy,\nlivelihoods, and lives are totally dependent on oil.\nNow take a look at the graph showing\nworld oil discoveries and world oil ex-traction. Discoveries peaked in 1964,\nand we are not finding enough oil to\nreplace the stuff being pumped out of\nthe ground. This means that at some\npoint, because it is not renewable, the\navailability of oil will peak and start\nto decline. This will almost certainly\nhappen in under 20 years, and could\nhappen within 10 years, according to a\nrecent report on Global Oil Depletion\nby the UK Energy Research Centre,\nbased at Imperial College.\nSo, what are the implications of a decline in oil availability? It is easy to say\nthat we should just start using other\nthings, but not so easy actually to come\nup with a plan for doing that. Substitution by gas and coal is surprisingly\ndifficult - you can convert them to liquid fuels, but in practice it's just not a\nviable large-scale option.\nRenewable energy is great but without a huge shot in the arm from the\ngovernment (something unlikely to be\nforthcoming in the current economic\nsituation), it simply can't be scaled up\nquickly enough even to meet our climate change targets, let alone give us\ntrue independence from Saudi Arabia. Hydrogen vehicles - well, when\nare you planning to buy one? The price\nof electricity, transport, and heating\nwill inevitably rise after the oil peak -all these we can and will learn to live\nwith less of. But there is a key area\nwhere we are all truly vulnerable: food\nsecurity.\nFood contains hundreds of calories\nof fossil fuel input for every calorie\nthat you eat. Plants are grown using\nfertilisers, pesticides, tractor fuel for\nploughing, spraying and harvesting,\nmachinery fuel for processing, plastics\nfor packaging and diesel fuel for ship\nand lorry transport to your local supermarket - all from cheap oil.\nBritain is currently unable to feed\nitself (just read the country of origin\nThe issue of climate change is one of\nthe many issues that walks the tightrope of a boundary between science\nand politics. It may be continuously\non the agenda, but rather like an omnipresent smell, you get used to it and\nforget it. In fact, it\u2019s built up its own\nlittle hate club. But whatever happens,\nenvironmentalism is not the same as\nsocialism, and even if it was, so what?\nI'll often think about the wildernesses\nof this country, such as the Cairngorms\nand Dartmoor, and comfort myself in\nthinking that man is nothing but a pin\nprick in the grand scheme of things.\nMan cannot tame the great, wild outdoors and place a Tesco superstore or\na McDonalds wherever it pleases because we are not capable of doing such\nthings. An old saying on the moor goes\n\"scratch Dartmoor and she\u2019ll break\nyour back\u201d. This phrase has come to be\ndue to the number of ventures man has\nmade to try and tame it: for example\nthere was a failed, and expensive attempt to build a railway from a nearby\nfringe village up onto the high peat\nworkings.\nHowever, there are those that take\nthis a little bit too far. Those who believe that no matter how much man\ninterferes with the planet, it will always correct itself as it has been doing\non a cyclical basis for billions of years.\nThe Gaia hypothesis proposes that\nthe earth is a single, self-regulating\norganism.\nThis belief is not only incorrect and\nthe official Republican Party line (and\npotentially industry-led), but is also\nextremely dangerous. It is the scientific equivalent of a cum rag. And so\nbecause of this idea, the logical policy\ngoes \"Is it worth compromising the\neconomy for a cause that may actually\nbe flawed? No? Ok then we\u2019ll just carry\non as we are\".\nWhat the world has to realise is\nthat economic growth, prosperity and\nreaching the summit of the capitalism\nladder can\u2019t occur at all when there is\nno Earth to build these systems upon.\nYou would think that a little compromise on everyone\u2019s part would be\nthe sensible way forward, however\nthere are those with whom this is just\nincompatible.\nAn angle that this issue must be attacked from is the moral side. Al Gore's\n2006 documentary \u2018An Inconvenient\nTruth\u2019 showed not only that the USA\nmissed out on having the ideal leader\nas a successor to Clinton, but also that\nit was possible - through the eloquent\nskill of conveying scientific data and\nresearch as straightforward information for anyone to understand - to pull\nErica Thompson\nErica Thompson Science Reporter\non the heartstrings of individuals and\nmake people think about the fairness\nof the effect they're having on the plan-et, without resorting to religion to have\nto impose morals.\nIt had the power and clarity to make\nus think about how our actions are undoubtedly affecting the sort of world\nwe might be leaving for generations to\ncome, and how it is morally incomprehensible to leave such a place.\nConfronting the issue on another\nfront, a new UN report suggests that\nslowing the growth of the population\ncould help to combat climate change.\nIt said that if women were empowered\nto take control of their reproductive\nhealth, they may choose to have fewer\nchidren and consequently this would\nreduce pressure on resources and the\nenvironment.\nThe 94-page report calls for any deal\ncoming out of Copenhagen to include\nmeasures to empower women. This report states what we all know to be common sense, but for some reason people\nrefuse to be vocal about, for fear of rac-ism. Well, you can call it racism if you\nlike, but there\u2019s nothing sensible about\nfamilies having ridiculous numbers of\nchildren, with Islamic and African nations mostly to blame for this.\nThe world clearly has a finite amount\nof resources and so it is an angle for attack on the problem of climate change\nthat is all too often forgotten about. As\nNobel Laureate Harry Kendall stated,\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t halt population growth\nwith justice and compassion, it will\nbe done for us by nature, brutally and\nwithout pity - and will leave a ravaged\nworld\u201d. Maybe China had it right all\nalong?\nAnyway, whatever your opinion on\nthese matters, it is a human character\ntrait to never give up. Even without the\nappropriate backing from industry nor\nfrom government, scientists are universally attempting to find solutions to\nthe problem of climate change which\nis quite obviously real and extremely\ndangerous - as it has been for a good\nfew years now.\nWith the critical Copenhagen conference a matter of weeks away, here\nwe present to you a series of articles that are themed to coincide with\nGreen Week.\nThe government needs to wake up to the challenge of peak oil, fast\nNathan Ley\nNathan Ley Science Editor\nlabels in your next shopping basket).\nNow, food and indeed oil imports are\nunlikely to collapse overnight, but the\nprice of oil has been extremely volatile\nover the last few years and the price of\nfood commodities on global markets\nhas risen to the point that many in the\ndeveloping world can no longer afford\nto buy it.\nFilth, pure industrial filth - a symbol of the over-indulgence of the industrial generation?\nWorld oil discoveries and world oil extraction\nThese patterns are set to continue\nand worsen especially with the impacts of climate change. Peak Oil is a\nglobal problem, and it is enforced on\nus by physics, not politics. Unfortunately, physics doesn't have an obvious\nsolution yet. Our government can no\nlonger afford to keep their heads in the\nsand.\n\u201cSo, what are the\nimplications of\na decline in oil\navailability?\u201d\n\n"

Then again, it may have\nbeen the Statue of Liberty.\nWhoever it was, they were certainly onto something. It is decidedly\ndifficult being green, and a great deal\nharder to pretend to be green. And, of\ncourse, quite possibly racist.\nThat\u2019s why, in fine Capitalist style, I\u2019m\ngoing to subtly dodge the issue at hand.\nBut, in order to avoid being dismissed as\nsome ivory tower columnist (or should\nthat be some ivory column tourist?) so far\nout of the loop as to receive a negligible\nfield from the current running through it, I will deal with the burning green question in my own manner.\nAhem.\nTrains, eh? You can just about live with\nthem, and you\u2019d be able to live a great deal\nslower without them. But they pollute.\nBoy do they pollute. Right? I mean, what\ndo I know? I\u2019ve traveled up and down the\ncountry a few times in a seat opposite the\nlavatory and I can tell you that the air gets\npretty polluted. But as for the total carbon\nemissions, I honestly don\u2019t know. And if\nI\u2019m starting a new trend for honesty in my\nprose, I might as well tell you flat out that\nfur the purposes of this piece it doesn\u2019t\nmatter. Not really. At least, it won\u2019t to you.\nAnd that\u2019s the important thing.\nEver since my girlfriend left London to\nswing her plan for world domination into\nphase two, I\u2019ve been making regular train\njourneys up and down the country from\nLondon \u2018We\u2019ve Got A Problem\u2019 Euston.\nAnd there are certain things you learn\nabout train travel once you\u2019ve journeyed\nthe distance from New York to Salt Lake\nCity in three months and a half. You get\nthe chance to learn all the little secrets of\nhow your railway station of choice works,\nand you come to grips with all the techniques for making sure you get a seat on\nthe train you want.\nThe most important lesson you learn,\nhowever, is that none of these techniques\nworks. Ever.\nI\u2019m sure Murphy, when he wasn\u2019t meting out sinister laws and generally being\na depressive Irish git, was a commuter. It\ncertainly would have given him enough\ntime to come up with his vast literary output of one law:\n\u2018Toast will always fall with the buttered\nside down\u2019 and its corollary.\n\u2018Unless you smear the other side with\nchocolate spread, honey or Tiptree\u2019s\nblackcurrant preserve\u2019\nOnly a man with intimate knowledge\nof trains and their greasy ways could have\ncome up with so black an outlook on life.\nTake me, for instance. Where once\nmy idealism and naivety were such that\nI could watch Strictly Come Dancing in\nthe belief that I was being treated to top\nclass entertainment, I am now an ardent\nand committed pessimist. I have become\nthe sort of person who believes we\u2019re all\nso damned thirsty that the glass of water\nitself is a mirage.\nAnd I blame the railway system. Boo!\nYou (quite possibly) carbon-guzzling,\nsmoke-belching harbingers of (what\nmight well turn out to be) ecological\ndoom. But where was I? Ah yes, on a\ntrain. Lol. Roffle. Bare, or \u2018bear\u2019\n, or quite\npossibly even \u2018bair\u2019\n, jokes.\nThe trouble, you see, starts with getting\nto the right platform. At Euston station\nthere are two ways to find out what platform your train is boarding from. You can\neither read it off the massive boards that\nhang in the main hall, or off the smaller\ndeparture board that can be found directly beneath the others. And while the\namateur traveler may see no difference\nbetween the two, those of us who are\nfamiliar with the functioning of Euston\u2019s\ndelicate ecosystem can tell that therein\nlies the difference between life and death.\nDon\u2019t ask me how I found this out \u2013 or,\nmore to the point, don\u2019t ask me how my\ngirlfriend found this out \u2013 but information appears on the smaller board frac-tionallybeforeitappearsonthelargerone.\nWhich means, gentle reader, that a glance\nin the right direction at the right time can\nget you running in the right direction microseconds ahead of the hordes of sweaty\nbusinessmen, hoodie-wearing yoofs and\nshopping bag-laded old women.\nIn other words, by the time the ubiq-uitous, androgynous voice says \u201cthe next\ntrain to Manchester will be leaving from\nplatform 6,\u201d you can be scampering halfway across the station.\nThe disadvantage of this technique, of\ncourse, is that it turns you into a neurotic\nwreck. The constant shifting of focus, the\ninnumerable false starts and incessant\nnail-biting do take their toll. But, at least\nyou get to be first on the train, right? And\nthat\u2019s a good thing, right? Hmm. Well, in\ntheory.\nTune in next week \u2013 same time, same\nplace \u2013 to hear about our hero\u2019s exploits\non on board the Irrelevantly-Named Express. Will he find a seat? Will he purchase and consume train food? Will a\nlarge hairy dog choose to jump heavily\non his back? Find out all this and more in\nnext week\u2019s issue.\nGilead Amit andhisbizarretrainofthought\nT\nhe resignation of the Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, on\nMonday morning came\nas quite a shock, mainly\nbecause Sir Roy had only\nbeen at the helm for about 16 months.\nThis relatively short amount of time\nat the top, and the wording in his resignation email, has led to many conspiracies about his untimely departure. The\nmain question on a lot of lips, however,\nis: Did he jump ship or was he pushed\noff the plank? I know a lot of the students couldn\u2019t care less, in fact I don\u2019t\nthink that a lot of students even know\nwhat a Rector is, let alone who they\nmight be. To put it simply, he\u2019s the boss.\nI think that most people do know\nwho the rector is, maybe you should\nsay \u201cI know that most people couldn\u2019t\ncare less but blah blah it\u2019s important\u201d\nFirst of all, let\u2019s get some background\ninformation. Sir Roy was a student at\nImperial in the late 60\u2019s where he studied Zoology, before gaining a PhD in\nParasitology in 1971. After he had finished his studies, he remained at Imperial doing research and he became a\nProfessor of Parasite Ecology in 1982\nand the head of Biology from 1984-1993. Over the years, he generated a\nreputation of being a world expert in\ninfectious diseases. The one thing that\nyou can take from this is that he is an\nImperial Man. He was a student here,\nhe knows what it\u2019s like to be an under-graduate, postgraduate, researcher,\nlecturer and head of department. He\nknows the College inside-out.\nSir Roy left in 1993 to join the University of Oxford where he was head of the\nZoology. This is where things started\nto go wrong for him. In 2000 he had to\nresign from the University of Oxford\nafter he had made allegations that a female member of staff had slept her way\nto her position. An inquiry also found\nthat he was in breach of rules, after he\nwas found to have a conflict of interest\nas director and shareholder of International Biomedical and Health Sciences\nConsortium \u2014 an Oxford-based biomedical consultancy that had awarded\ngrants to his research centre. Sir Roy\nwas also the Chief Scientific advisor\nto the Government when the Foot and\nMouth crisis came about, arguably his\nadvice led to the unnecessary culling\nof millions of healthy animals. More\nrecently, he was on BBC\u2019s Today Programme in May 2009, where he spoke\nabout Swine Flu claiming that \u201cthe pandemic has started.\u201d When you couple\nthis with the fact that he was getting\npaid \u00a3116,000 a year by GlaxoSmithKline, who were developing the vaccination for Swine Flu, some alarm bells\nstarted to ring in many people\u2019s ears.\nHis most recent bit of controversy was\nthe interview he gave to the Evening\nStandard where he seemed to be in favor of privatising universities.\nHis appointment as Rector was by\nand large seen as a positive one by stu-dents, postgraduates, researches and\nprofessors alike, mainly because he was\na student at Imperial.\nThere was hope that he would\nchange the business appearance Imperial had and return it to what it really\nis, a place for higher education, a place\nfor ground breaking research, a world\nleading university. This was clearly\nevident in the interview with that felix did last year, where he spoke about\nwanting researchers to focus on quality\nand not quantity, and wanting to give\nthem the time and space where this\ncould be possible, in his own words,\nhe wanted to make sure the researchers weren\u2019t \u201cconsistently pressured by\nperformance matrix\u201d. Seeing as I\u2019m\ndoing research now, that sounds like\na great thing. On the student front, he\nhighlighted how he wanted to look into\nthe student satisfaction figures and really get to grips with what \u2018s making\nthem happy and what \u2018s not. All in all,\nit seems to me that his objectives were\nfocused on bringing the university\nback to students and take it away from\nthe business mentality that it had when\nhe started.\nThere was one main problem to this\ndream, Sir Richard Sykes. The previous Rector was an ambitious man, he\nchanged the structure of the college,\nmade it more business focused. He\nhired staff that would enable him to do\nthis and fired the ones that obstructed\nhim. His greatest achievement was Imperial\u2019s rise to 5th best in the world.\nHis greatest failure was the fall of Imperial\u2019s student satisfaction figures to\nthe lowest of any Russell Group University (the UK\u2019s Ivy League). Even\nthough Sir Richard\u2019s gone, his legacy,\nand more importantly, the people he\nhired to make sure his dreams were\nachieved, are still here.\nSir Roy\u2019s appointment was made during the credit crunch. 5% budget cuts\nwere put on all departments, there was\na hiring freeze and also job losses in\nthe Humanities Department and even\nmore so in the Faculty of Medicine. To\nmake matters worse for Sir Roy, the research money granted this year by the\nHigher Education Funding Council for\nEngland was half of what Imperial had\nreceived the year before, despite the\nfact that Imperial had one of the best\nResearch Assessment Exercise marks\nin the whole country. The government\nfunded RAE found Imperial to have\nmany departments that were either\nworld leading (4*) or internationally\nexcellent (3*). Our faculties were either\nbest or second in the UK in terms of\nthe number of 4* and 3* research, with\nmany individual departments coming\nout on top (including Mechanical and\nAeronautics :-) ). Again going back to\nthe interview last year, it was evident\nthat he was unhappy with the amount\nof money Imperial was being given for\nresearch, and the \u00a35m decrease from\nthe government this year certainly\ndidn\u2019t help.\nIt seems to me at least, that his intentions were honorable. He truly wanted\nto help the students and the academic\nstaff at Imperial, but his hands were\nbound not only by the economic crisis,\nbut by the business men and women\nin the Blue Cube, who didn\u2019t want this\nchange to happen.\nI read somewhere that a Rector saying that he wants to \u2018focus more on\nhis research\u2019 is the same as a politician\nsaying he wants to step down from\npolitics to \u2018spend more time with his\nfamily.\u2019 So I ask, are you really sure he\nwanted to resign?\nWhatever you might think, Lord\nKerr is back on the search to find a\nnew rector, although with a salary of\n\u00a3370,000 a year I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll be\nshort of applicants.\nJovanNedic\nJovanNedic Assistant Editor\nMy take on\nthe past week\n\u201cLol.
