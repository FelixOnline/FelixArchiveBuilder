    "content": "Appealing Luv Jen?\n\u2022 The earthquake in Australia on 28th December\nlast year measured 5.5 on the Richter Scale. It was\ncentred on the city of Newcastle which is about 90\nmiles north of Sydney. Twelve people died and nearly\ntwo hundred were injured. Australia does not lie on\nthe Pacific Ring of Fire which passes through\nneighbouring New Zealand. However tectonic plate\nmovement along this fault is believed to cause\nstresses leading to the earthquake in Australian plate.\nAn updated risk map will shortly be published by the\nAustralian Seismological Centre, using the new data\ngathered, to aid revision of civil engineering\nregulations.\n\u2022 Proteins grown in space on board NASA's space\nshuttle have been reported to be larger and more\nordered in several cases than their counterparts grown\non earth. The reasons for this apparently lie in the\nconvection currents which occur in the solution on\nearth when a crystal precipitates. These currents are\nset up by localised changes in density which under\ngravity move away from the cyr stal. The end effect\nis that the cyr stal precipitates earlier and grows less\nevenly than in the absence of gravity. Using X Ray\ncrystallography these space grown proteins show\nmore detail, enabling their structure to be determined\nmore precisely.\n\u2022 The sex of a foetus can now be determined from\na blood sample. The test utilising the 'polymerase\nchain reaction' which amplifies sequences of DNA\nrib on ude o tides to be associated with the Ychromosone indicating that the foetus is male. This\nmethod doesn't carry the risks of infection or\nmiscarriage associated with current techniques, like\namniocentesis. It is expected to be used to decide\nwhether further tests are necessary for inherited sex\nrelated disorders such as haemophilia.\n\u2022 British power stations are predicted to fall outside\nEEC target levels for air pollution according to a recent\nreport commissioned by Greenpeace. The\nGovernment es tim tes that the overall emissions of\nsulphur dioxide will have fallen by 22% by 1993\ncompared with the 1980 reference level. However the\nauthors of the report claim that this will only be 10%.\nThe EEC specifies a20% reduction for both sulphur\ndioxide and nitrogen oxides.\nThree years ago the CEGB announced plans for a \u00a32 billion fitting of de sulphur is ation equipment to\nlarger coal fired plants, of which only a third of this\nsum has been agreed, involving the 4GW Drax power\nstation in North Yorkshire. To add to the uncertainty,\nthe two companies PowerGen and National Power\nwhich will replace the generating division of CEGB\nafter privatisation later this year have yet to decide\nhow the de sulphur is ation programme will be\nallocated.\n\u2022 Anyone wishing to write an article of general\nscientific interest or to publicise departmental\nresearch, please contact Simon Haslam via the FELIX\nOffice or the Physics UG pigeonholes.\nPage 12\nDear Dave,\nLast Monday a meeting was held at St Mary's to\ntry and sort out events that will contribute towards\nthe \u00a37M joint IC/St Mary's fund.\nSuch a horrific ally large amount of money will take\na lot of fundraising and so we need ideas of how to\nget that cash. The only proviso is that it must be\nenjoyable!\nSo please can your readership send their ideas to\nme via the Mech Eng pigeonholes.\nYours sincerely,\nGavin Pearson, Mech Eng 1.\nScrooge\nDear FELIX,\nHere is a sad tale of Christmas Past, well Autumn\nanyway. Bob Student is off on the annual task of\nsearching for accommodation.\nScrooge looked gloomily at the terminal of his v du and drummed his fingers on the desk. Things were nor\ngood. Imperial College PLC's profits were down again\nand even the CRAY II had not been able to come up\nwith a new money making scheme. The problem was\nthe students-they were becoming a liability again,\nsurely there must be some way he could bring in a bit\nmore cash. Then it hit him. But of course! A wry smile\ncrossed his face and he began to type...\n'I'm sorry, we can't renew your tenancy\nagreement-Imperial College refuse to sign for any\nmore como any lets as of this Summer. Don't ask me\nwhy,' continued the estate agent, 'we've already lost\ntwo-thirds of our trade. If the other London colleges\nfollow suit we're finished!'\nBob Student shook his head in disbelief. This was\nthe first he'd heard. But things were soon confirmed\nat the housing office:\n'Yes,' said the housing officer glumly, 'I'm afraid\nit's true. It's not our fault you understand, somebody\nup there.' She pointed to the ceiling. 'Company, err,\ncollege policy-it costs too much in administration.'\n'But we pay to sign the agreement,' wailed Bob.\nThe housing officer shrugged. 'We've got some\nspare places in Fisher Hotel if you want, \u00a3 5 0 per\nweek-bring your own ladder, of course,' she\nsuggested.\nThe student left. There was only one thing for it,\nhe set about forming his own company.\nMeanwhile, Scrooge was doing some explaining...\nThey can stay in halls, well a few of them anyway,\nand there's always the five private landlords\u2014I know\nthem all personally. Very trustworthy.'\nThe M.D. looked down his nose at him from behind\nthe huge oak desk. The news of riots under Waterloo\nBridge as students fought for their cardboard boxes\nhad disturbed him, as had the reports of individuals\ncommuting from their homes in Manchester, Durham\nand Swansea. If the press got to hear of this...\n'Do something, and do something fast,' he boomed.\nScrooge nodded, and backed hurriedly out of the\nroom, following the swath he'd cut in the thick pile\ncarpet on his way in. Frantically he racked his brains\nfor a solution. What now? Turn the heating off? No,\nhe'd had the boilers removed years ago. Then it struck\nhim. Why it was obvious! All they had to do was to\ncontinue the company lets, and charge a levy of 5%\non the rent. Simple! And there was still a week left\nto the start of the Autumn term-plenty of time for\nthe students to rearrange their accommodation.\nBoris t James Hampson), Elec Eng 3.\nDear Sir,\nIn the interests of correct reporting we have to point\nout that your article in the Christmas edition on the\nChristmas Caper hamper raffle contained a glaring\ninaccuracy.\nThe Union Finance Office, Mr Reggie\nBlennerhassett, DID win a hamper at this event. We\nare sure you will join us in congratulating him.\nHappy New Year and UP YOURS.\nThe Union Staff.\nPost Script\nDear Dave,\nWe know we can trust you to print this letter in the\nnext edition-first FELIX in the Spring Term.\nLuv Jen.\nEmbryonic\nDear FELIX,\nIn your article on the forthcoming Embryo Research\nBill, you suggest that amid all the clam our of\nconscience voting, the 'the purpose of the bill could\neasily be forgotten'. Your idea of this 'the purpose'\nwasn't really very clear, though your view that\nresearch must proceed at all costs was evident. I disagree.\nResearch proceeds from man and exists solely for\nthe benefit of man. Clearly, when investigations begin\nto harm man-his person or his dignity as a human\nbeing, they should be stopped, however interesting\nor useful the results might be. It'sac liche, I know,\nbut the ends don't justify the means. We all\ninstinctively recognise this-why else the horror when\nthe atrocities of Nazi medical research were\ndiscovered? Indeed, the Helsinki declaration states\nthat no medical research is ethic i ally per misi ble on one\nhuman individual that is not designed to help that\nperson but merely the rest of the human race.\nSo we come to the true purpose of the bill-to\ndefine the status of the embryo. Is it a human being?\nOne of the reasons the Warnock Committee gave the\n14 day limit was that after this, the nervous system\nis laid down and so the embryo can feel pain (though\nwhy this implies humanity I fail to see. Anaesthetics\nare generally thought to make operations humane).\nBut, as most scientists agree, this limit is only\narbitrary. The only definitive change occurs at the\nmoment of conception. The fertilised egg, or pre-embryo, as it is now called, is a complete entity.\nNothing is added to the genetic information it contains\nand nothing is taken away. There is no other logical\npoint in the development that can claim to be the start\nof human life-and does not our science pride itself\non its logic?\nYours sincerely,\nSarah Cassidy, Physics.\nLOST\nPlease has anyone found my black\njacket-with gold braiding. Lost the\nevening of Wed 10th Jan.\nReward \u00a320\nFelicity Marsh, Life Sci 4\nBeit Hall Room 89\n\n"

Congratulations are in order to the Rector\non gaining a knighthood and to the various banks in\npulling out of the government's top-up loans scheme.\nAt the time of reading I 'll be out of the office visiting\nFlorida for the purposes of competing in an\nInternational Dance Competition. My apologies to\nanyone trying to get hold of me, I 've every confidence\nthat Fiona and Dave can cope in my absence.\nFor those of you that were complaining last term\nabout lack of notice for Union General Meetings, here\nare the dates. Cancel ALL appointments, book them\nin your diary and come along.\nThursday 25 Jan, 6.00pm, Union Concert Hall.\nThursday, 1 Mar, 6.00pm, JCR (Elections hustings\nwith bar available)\nThursday, 8 Mar, 6.00pm, Great Hall (Results UGM)\nWatch future reports in FELIX to find out what will\nbe discussed at each of these meetings.\nLoans\nYou should all have heard the news over Christmas\nthat several of the major banks have pulled out of the\ngovernment's loan scheme. This does not, however,\nmean that the Government is going to drop the idea.\nIn going to the committees discussing the loans\nproposals in the House of Commons it has become\napparent to me that any amendments to the bill simply\nget voted out by conservative MPs toeing the party\nline. Whenever the time to vote comes, MPs hurriedly\nrush back in to the committee and vote against the\nopposition. So much for voting in local MPs that are\nsupposed to represent your views. Pressure still has\nto be maintained on MPs. However, many back\nbench ers are against the scheme so if you haven't contacted your MP please do so soon. Even Governing\nBody members at December's meeting were\npersuaded to write and use their contacts in the\npolitical world.\nOverseas Students\nDoes anybody remember the atrocities that occurred\nin China in the middle of 1989? Do you remember the\nthousands of people slaughtered? I hope you do\nbecause all of that trouble is not yet over. After\nquashing the uprising in the fight for democracy, the\nChinese government started a programme for reeducation with a crude and blatant programme of\nPage 10\npropaganda and brainwashing. Some Chinese\nstudents at Imperial don't really know what they are\ngoing to be going back to and some helped out during\nthe disaster by relaying information back to China of\nwhat was happening seen through western eyes.\nMany of the students poured their own finances into\nsending faxes, organising demonstration, buying\nwreaths, making publicity. Imperial College Union\nhelped out with these finances and last year launched\na fund-raising appeal to recoup this money. Last week\nthe Rector and his wife kindly made a personal\ndonation and persuaded the College to donate as well,\nmy thanks to them.\nIf anybody else would like to make a donation,\nplease pop in to the Union Office or send us a cheque\nmade payable to 'Imperial College Union' marked\nChinese Students Appeal.\nAccommodation\nLast term the proposed rents for the coming academic\nyear were published in FELIX. I was expecting some\ndiscussion of these to come up at Governing Body last\nterm; it didn't. This means one of two things. Either\ndiscussion will come up this term or the Rector is the\nsingle person that decides the rents. If the latter is the\ncase then you would be right in joining me in being\nvery, very worried. All along the line the college has\nignored warning from myself, the students and the\nwardens of the effects of any rent increases. Instead\nof simply stinging the students for refurbishing what\nare rapidly becoming decrepit and dangerous halls of\nresident, surely the College should be looking for\ninnovative ideas to generate cash for the upkeep of\nthese halls. Instead, an appeal has been launched to\ngenerate monies for a new residence, adding to the\nstock which we can't afford to keep, can't sell and\ncan't maintain. Last year applications to Imperial were\nway down, last term 40% of students attending a UGM said they would not have come to London if they\nhad known the real expenses involved; only this year\nCollege had to fill up spaces in nearly every\ndepartment through UCCA clearance.\nPersonally I am not happy that College is doing its\nbest to look after the financial welfare of its students.\nSo how about some advice:\n1. Freeze the rent levels.\n2. Ensure adequate maintenance of halls.\n3. Get companies to sponsor individual rooms.\n4. Get companies to donate furniture and furnishings\nin return for advertising.\n5. See if first-year students do actually want to live\nin halls of residence.\n6. Provide an adequate service to place students in\nthe private rented sector.\nIf the College does not look at these seriously and\ncome back with replies then I 'll be making sure I 'll be\ndoing my job by looking after the welfare of the\nstudents and advising that they simply can't afford\nto live in London. An addition to the Alternative\nProspectus will go out and articles will go in the\nNational Press. Let the prospective students know the\ntruth and if it's not all rosy, then so be it.\nWelfare\nYve Posner, the Union Welfare Adviser, has been\nworking very hard preparing a housing pack for\nstudents. This will be ready shortly and in plenty of\ntime for those of you in halls of residence that have\nnever had to find your own place. I'm looking to stage\na 'housing roadshow' in the halls with Yve so that we\ncan answer questions on private rented\naccommodation.\nAt the very beginning of the summer term we're\nhoping to organise a welfare campaign on coping with\nstress. This, hopefully, will cover minor stress\nproblems resulting in, say, lack of sleep up to major\nbuild-up of stress which can result in breakdowns. I think this will be particularly useful, especially during\nthe exam term.\nTransport\nThe new van is here, it runs well and I hope it stays\nthat way. Deadline for van applications for the Easter\nvacation is Friday, 16th February.\nAnybody wishing to go abroad please give me a few\nweeks notice so that I can arrange a green card (i.e. insurance).\nFinally....\nImperial College Union is at last coming to grips with\nmodern technology...it now possesses an answering\nmachine. The answering machine will be used on\nextension 3500 in the evenings and during weekends.\nIf you have any difficulties or questions, simply leave\na message and the sabbatical who is on duty will\ncollect the message and get back to you.\n\n"

And it wasn't even\norganised, except of course for Santa and the Xmas\ntree. The music, mainly from the Snuff Said LP threw\nthe place into turmoil and people into a frenzy. When\nit was good is was very, very good and it just didn't get worse. Things did get extreme, ending in twenty\nextra people on the stage and a broken amp! Their\nversion of / Think We're Alone Now reduced Tiffany's to insignificance, I mean at least this version had\nbollocks!\nThe Senseless Things have been having an\nawkward time of late with some very successful\nsupport slots, but they followed this with their first\nLP Postcard CV, which was not as well received as\ntheir music should be.\nWhether their fault or not, they were headlining\nabove Snuff who had just given us a manic three\nquarters of an hour, and their reputation was surely\non the line.\nThey pulled out all of the stops and the place shook.\nThis was not as spontaneous or manic, but it was\ngood. People danced and shouted, and songs like Too\nMuch Kissing and Trevor took things from good to\nbetter and beyond. Although it all sounded good, the\nlack of communication with the audience showed\ntonight that their priorities lay in reliability. They are\ndefinitely still a force to be reckoned with in the\nhardcore scene, but Snuff herald much greater things\nthan they have now, so make sure you catch up with\nthem. Watch out, they move fast.\nThe whole gig was recorded to be edited into a video fanzine with other live recordings of Fugazi, Wat\nTyler, Jesus Jones, The Sugarcubes, Shrug,\nSofahead, Celestial Orgy, Crane, Bomb Disneyland\nand Mega City 4.\nFor details get in touch with:\nThe Idea Video Franzine,\n8, St Paul's Road,\nThornby,\nCleveland TS17 6LH. Well worth a slice of the grant cheque.\nDEL.\nClosing the dustbin lid on Chapter 22\n'They've done it, by George, they've done it'; after\nweeks of successful touring with The Wonderstuff\nand Pop Will Eat Itself, Ned's Atomic Dustbin have at.\nlast signed a record deal, with Chapter 22 and hope\nto release a single soon.\nIncidentally, Pop Will Eat Itself are also signed to\nChapter 22; cor, what a coincidence, would it be their\nfanatical following of the Ned's which helped them\ninto a record deal?\nNed's also played a great gig at Camden Palace on\nTuesday 9th Jan which will be reported in full next\nweek as well as an exclusive interview with the band.\nNed's Atomic Dustbin are definitely gonna be big\nin the pop hardcore scene and don't forget where you\nheard it first.\nDEL.\nPage 6\nSolo Guitarist\nPlaying at Mendelssohn's Wine Bar (1 High Street,\nBromley) next Monday (15th) is an up and coming solo\nguitarist and singer Briggin.

    "content": "(\nPop Will Eat Itself &\nNed's Atomic Dustbin\nLondon Marquee 18/12/89\nThe end came and went on December 15. Hoardes\nof students set free from the shackles of work; exams\nand tests over, lectures no more. Only three weeks\nof festive debauchery lay ahead (work, January 7 of\ncourse). Everyone who's anyone just wanted to party\nthe night away and someone must have told Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Pop Will Eat Itself at the Marquee,\nthis gig beat popping down to Southside for a drink\nor ten.\nNed's Atomic Dustbin are currently riding high with\na successful tour with The Wonderstuff (Miles of the\nWonderstuff even graced this gig with his presence)\nand now touring with The Poppies, their most devoted\ngroupies.\nNed's Atomic Dustbin immediately brought the\nMarquee to life and over the next half hour took us\nall to Hell and back in a blender, fortunately by the\nscenic route. John (vocals), Brass (guitar), Alex (bass),\nMatt (another bass) and Dan (drums) give a set of solid\nthrash y pop, with a powerful bassline backing a manic\nelectric guitar and vocals. Everyone danced while they\nstill had the chance, but only the groupies could sing\nbecause the band are still without anything down on\nvinyl; one quote from a girl in the crowd epi to mises our feelings, 'Shit, why haven'tI got any of this?'.\nAnother Siouxsie and the Banshees (lack of) record\ncompany saga?\nPop Will Eat Itself came on and the stage was set,\nthe crowd had been excited but all were here for this...\n'Music is the most powerful medium in the world,\nladies and gentlemen, music is a gift of God', launched\nthe Poppies into a lively set continuing the party. Their\nmusic was mostly from Box Frenzy and This is the\nDay...This is the Hour...This is This, but backing tapes\nmade the musical additions of the Poppies almost\nsuperfluous. But still the Poppies made the day with\na convincing performance en citing people to dance 'till\nthey dropped. 'Show me you can do the side to\nfucking side' shout from Clint to the sound of Infect\nMe left flattened corpses smeared on each of the side\nwalls, it was as if he had everyone by the short and\ncur lies and was swinging them from side to side, there\nwas no escape, but who wanted to anyway?\nGraham sat high above on his 'throne' due to his\nbroken leg, waving his megaphone and Clint barechested and glistening in sweat cavorted on stage\nbeneath the strobe lights driving fans into a state of\nfrenzy, people took their chances and swarmed the\nstage and then 'stage-dived' back into the oblivion of\nthe crowd, happy with their ten seconds of glory\ndancing on stage with Clint Poppie. Clint was so\nimpressed he even had a go himself, leaping from the\nstage for about a minute to dance in amongst the\ncrowd at the risk of being pulled limb from limb.\nAn encore filled with goodies like Let's Get Ugly and\nLove Missile F1-17 ended the party, so we poured out\ninto the rain, wishing to go to the next two nights\nwhen they play again; but I would be surely satisfied\nwith Ned's disc to annoy the folks over Christmas.\nPerhaps I 'll write to Santa, we can all dream.\nPat Metheny\nDEL.\nHammersmith Odeon\nDespite continued critical acclaim and massive\npopularity for a jazz artist you could have walked into\nthis show for nothing. It is lovely to see the ticket\ntouts lose money for a change! At the end of a European tour to promote his latest disc, Letter From\nHome Pat Metheny was clearly pleased to be able to\nspeak English to his audience but it is not his style to\nconsort with his paying public and forty minutes\nelapsed before he introduced his band.\nThere is a strong latin influence in much of his music\nand having a South American percussion section\ncomprising Armando Marcell and Pedro Azarr aided\nthe carnival atmosphere. However, the faithful had\ncome to see Metheny's stylish guitar soloing. Playing\nmainly semi-acoustic with occasional switches to a discordant electric he plundered much of his back\ncatalogue to give an all encompassing 'best of show\nincluding old favourites like Hermitage, The First Circle\nand Are You Going With Me?.\nHis recent recorded output has been likened to Los\nAngeles shopping mall mu zak as lush production has\ntaken precedence from the music. Heard live pieces\nsuch as Better Days Ahead, Spring Ain't Here and the\nC Ballad show that Metheny has lost none of his\nmelodic ability to make sophisticated jazz accessible\ndespite keyboards wizard Lyle Mayes efforts to play\nhis solos in unrelated keys and tempos. This kept\neveryone mes meri sed throughout the two hours and\ntwenty minute show and left the faithful sated for\nanother two years before he visits these shores again.\nCDL.\nPage 5\n\n"

How generous, I thought,\nwith a cynical idea of her real motives in the back of\nmy mind. Now she refuses to say who paid for the\ngoodies, which probably add up to around \u00a380.

    "content": "Robin Hood &\nMad Marion\nTired of all the traditional run of the mill Christmas\npantomimes-the same old stories and the same old\njokes? Well here'sap an to with a difference-not\nbilled as such but in the same tradition.\nThe year is 1189 and the first ever free elections\nin Sherwood Forest have been held. The two main\ncandidates are Robin Hood and Mad Marion-a wicked witch type of character.\nThe first person on stage is Heme the Hunter who\nsets the scene. In true pantomime tradition the hero,\nRobin Hood is played by a woman and the dame, Little\nJoan's nurse, is played by a man. Audience\nparticipation is encouraged, but fear not! This is not\nof the 'Oh no he isn't, oh yes he is' variety but they\ndo ask the audience to join in a couple of songs and\nalso involve them in the play especially when they are\na bit slow on the uptake with some of the jokes.\nThis pantomime is essentially for adults-not that\nthere is anything in it that is not suitable for children-merely that they would not appreciate much of the\nhumour.\nThe play is allegorical\u2014a fact which starts to\nbecome apparent at the beginning with Robin Hood\nand his Green Party and Mad Marion's plans to cut\ndown all the trees in Sherwood Forest so that she can\nrear cattle for her mad burgers. The character of Mad\nMarion is ob vio u lsy s at i rising Margaret Thatcher-she\nhad ruled Sherwood Forest with an iron hand for ten\nyears, she is power mad and she wears a blue (Tory)\ndress. At the end the moral is spelled out, leaving us\nin no doubt whatsoever.\nThe stars of the show are undoubtedly Heme the\nHunter who, whenever he gets too excited, bursts out\nof his jerkin, turns green and changes into 'the\nincredible gg g...', and Little John/Little Joan. Heme's manner is just right for his character and Helen Copp\nas Little Joan strikes exactly the right note of little\ngirlish ness. The songs for the show are highly original and very\namusing adding greatly to the performance. The\nhumour is also good and enhanced by the characters\nsometimes talking directly to the audience.\nI have only one thing against the play and that is\nits weak ending. They opted for a happy-ever-after\nand moralistic ending which detracted somewhat\nfrom the impact of the play.\nAll in all, a good evening's entertainment let down\nonly by a rather poor ending-well worth a visit.\nRobin Hood and Mad Marion is on at the Cafe Canal\nTheatre, Bridge House, Delamere Terrace, London\nW2, 01-289 6054 or 01-722 5395. It runs until\nJanuay 28, Tuesday-Sunday and concessionary\ntickets are \u00a34.50.\nJAY\nPage 4\nThe Liar\nA young man arrives in Paris after having been away\nat Poitiers studying law. He feels like a fish out of\nwater and longs to impress the lovely local ladies and\nhis old school fellows. To hide his feelings of\ninadequacy he spins tales of his exploits in the army\nin Germany and of elaborate parties he has thrown.\nThis is the plot of The Liar, featuring Alex Jennings\nas Durante, the liar. The story is complex with many\ntwists and turns, sometimes leaving one breathless\ntrying to keep up.\nSomewhere along the line Durante and his stories\nincur the wrath of his friend Alcippe, who thinks\nDurante is trying to seduce his fiancee. Meanwhile his\nfather, for whom, Durante, his only son, is the apple\nof his eye, is trying to do his best for his son by finding\nhim a suitable wife. Durante, however, thinks he has\nsomeone else in mind and tells another lie to get\nhimself out of this predicament.\nEventually he is caught in his own web of lies and\nhas to be truthful for once.\nThe play by Pierre Corneille, was originally written\nin French and has been translated by a modern\nplaywright in as much of the style of the original as\npossible. An unusual feature is that it is in rhyme a fact that does not become apparent immediately but\nwhich, once realised, can later be slightly irritating at\ntimes, although providing scope for humour, for\ninstance when an expected rhyme is not forthcoming.\nAlthough Durante is the character around whom the\nplot revolves, the real star of the play is undoubtedly\nDurante's valet, Cliton, played by Desmond Borrit with\na Welsh accent, whose shrewd commonsense and\nhonesty is at first shadowed by a veil of apparent\nobtuseness.\nGood use is made of asides to give a better insight\ninto the characters' minds and to add humour.\nThe Liar is an amusing, lighthearted, comedy\ns at i rising human nature and life in seventeenth\ncentury Paris (do French people really make jokes like\nthat about the English?) and if that sort of thing is up\nyour street then it is certainly worth a visit.\nYou can see The Liar at the Old Vic, Waterloo Road.\nPerformances run from Monday-Friday at 7.30pm with a2.30 pm matinee on Wednesdays. Tickets cost\nbetween \u00a3 7 and \u00a315.\nJAY.\nOliver and Company\nWalt Disney have had a stab at Dickens before-remember Mickey's Christmas Carol? Well, how does\nthis latest offering, based (somewhat loosely) on\nOliver Twist fare?\nA typical Disney recipe has been used, first make\nmost of the characters into animals, Oliver becomes\na 'cute' kitten, Dodger and the gang become a pack\nof streetwise dogs. Throw in the odd human to taste.\nNeed a heart rending beginning? Right, abandon Oliver\nin a box, somewhere in modern day New York City,\nand then wash him away in a torrent of rain. (All\ntogether now-a a ahh l). Sprinkle with songs and leave\nto simmer for 74 mins.\nThe animation is as superb as ever, my only quibble\nbeing that on occasions, the foreground characters\nand the backgrounds didn't fit together very well. The\ncharacter is at ions are nice, with Francis, the ever-so-cultured Bulldog, and Tito, the lively hispanic\nchihuahua stealing the show, although Georgette the\npampered poodle, with gorgeous vocals by Bette\nMidler, is nearly as good. The songs are competent,\nas one would expect with names like Billy Joel and\nHuey Lewis involved, although snatches of a familiar\ntune from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs evoke\nnostalgic memories.\nHere lies the crux of the problem. Somewhere along\nthe line that something which turned a good animated\nfilm into a Disney has been lost. So instead of a gem\nof a film, which would have appealed to people of all\nages we have a good animated movie, whose post\nHe-man-action-adventure style will a peal to younger\nkids. It really does look as if the Don Bluth Studios [An\nAmerican Tail, The Land Before Time) are the true\nholders of Walt's legacy, not the company which\nbears his name.\nAdam T. "

    "content": "Government continues loans\nplan as banks pull out\nThe Government's student loans proposals\nare expected to go through despite the pullout of the high street banks. Last Tuesday\nLabour MPs forwarded a motion to\nadjourn the committee on student loans\ncomplaining that they had not been\ninformed as to how the scheme will work.\nThey were defeated by 10 votes to 9.\nMr. Robert Jackson, minister for higher\neducation, said that the banks had agreed\nto pay \u00a3500,000 in compensation to the\ngovernment. He explained that now the\nscheme would be administered by a company owned by the Department of\nEducation and Science (DES). The two\ndirectors of the company will be Mr John\nVereker, deputy secretary for higher\neducation, and Mr Tom Jeffery, who was\nformerly private secretary to Mr Kenneth\nBaker when he was in the DES. It was not\nmade clear whether the 250 staff would\nbe civil servants or from the private sector.\nThe government was accused of wasting\n\u00a32.7 billion on the scheme, as it will take\n20 years for the graduates repayment to\nmatch the expenditure on the proposal.\nOpposition MPs claimed that the\nscheme was now unworkable. Mr Simon\nHughes, of the Liberal Democrats, said\n'The Government has had the centre shot\nout of this extremely important piece of\nlegislation. It is only a fig leaf of a bill with\nnothing behind it.'\nConservative MPs responded by saying\nthat the only difference was that now\nstudents would find it more difficult to\napply for loans. Mr Jackson dismissed the\nbank problem, saying 'The withdrawal of\nthe banks makes no difference at all to the\nprinciple of student loans and it makes\nvery little difference to the administration\nof the scheme. We are well on course for\nthe start we had planned for the autumn\nof 1990.'\nThis is despite the central role assigned\nto banks in the Price-Waterhouse report\nof May 1989.\nRecruitment of staff for the 'Student\nLoans Company' has started with\nadvertisements in Scottish newspapers for\na business manager at a salary of up to \u00a332,000.\nBar cash withdrawal\nA total of \u00a31430 was stolen from the union\nbar safe last weekend. The theft was\ndiscovered by Adrian Johnson, bar\nmanager, on Sunday night. The Criminal\nInvestigation Department (CID) are\nlooking into the case and 'are confident'\nof finding the culprit. They are seeking\na man to help them with their enquiries.\nThe safe was not forced, and the thief\nis believed to have had access to the k'eys. Mr Malcolm Aldridge of the finance\ndepartment, was unsure of the insurance\nsituation. 'The union money is covered by\nthe college policy\u2014a \u00a31000 policy on any\nsafe, but a basic principle of all money\ninsurance policies is that they do not cover\nfor employees' fraud,' he said. Mr\nAldrdige added that the College had a separate policy insuring against\nemployees' fraud, although he said that\nthis only covered claims between \u00a310,000\nand an upper limit. He commented that the\n'only likely place for this to happen is the\nSherfield Building.'\nImperial College Union are searching for\na new Assistant Bar Manager, following\nthe unprompted departure of Mr Andrew\nCarson last Monday.\nj mm\nImperial's communists\nMr Valentin Ceausescu, the eldest son of\nthe ex-Dictator of Roumania, was a graduate of Imperial College in the 60's, it was revealed this week.\nHe entered the college in 1967 and\ngraduated in 1970 with a third class\nhonours degree in physics. Professor\nT.W. Kibble said that his memory of\nValentin was of an intelligent and pleasant\nyoung man with a serious interest in\nparticle physics, though he added that this\nwas a long time ago.\nDr I.G. Halliday, of the Physics\ndepartment, said that his impression was\nthat Valentin 'tried to avoid the politics\nof his family, which was quite hard to do.\nHe tried to be a professional research\nscientist, though not of a high order.'\nThe fate of Valentin Ceausescu, who is\n40, is not known in post- > evolutionary\nRoumania. He was last known heading a Roumanian Nuclear Power Research\nInstitute, living in comfortable obscurity\nin Roumania with his family.\nHis only known argument with his\nfather was over his father's rigid views on\nValentin's favourite game, which was\nbridge.\nThe expected first woman leader of the\nCommunist party of Great Britain, Ms\nNina Temple, 33, was also a graduate at\nI.C. She entered in 1974 and left in 1977\nwith a2B degree in Materials. She is\nexpected to be elected this weekend.\n\n"

    "content": "Parenthood\nSteve Martin has an impressive list of comedy film\ncredits behind him; Roxanne, The Man with Two\nBrains, Little Shop of Horrors, to name but three.\nParenthood is a film which allows Martin to display\nmore of his acting talents while still providing him with\na chance to show his comic genius.\nMartin stars as Gil Buckman, father of three young\nchildren. His childhood wasn't very happy and he\nthinks his own father was lousy at being a parent. Gil\nhad determined to be a better father to his children\nbut finds that despite all his efforts, his children still\nhave problems.\nGil's father, Frank, thinks that his days of parenting\nare over until the return of Larry, his youngest child\nand the black sheep of the family. Larry is into get-rich-quick schemes and is forever having to be bailed\nout of trouble. When he returns he brings with him,\nmuch to everyone's surprise, his son Cool.\nGil's older sister, Helen, is a divorcee struggling to\nbring up two teenage children on her own as well as\ncoping with the demands of work. Her sixteen year\nold daughter seems to want to grow up too quickly\nwhile she cannot communicate at all with thirteen\nyear old Garry (Leaf Phoenix) who is feeling rejected\nby his father.\nThe younger sister Susan and her husband Nathan\n(Rick 'Little Shop of Horrors' Moranis) have one child\nPatti for whom they have great hopes. She has karate\nlessons, French lessons and reads Kafka-and she is\nonly three years old.\nThe film, while concentrating more on Gil and his\nproblems is essentially about the whole of the\nBuckman family, all four generations, including\nGrandma-a typical fictional granny, and dithering,\nMiss Marple-like old lady, whose ramblings at first\nseem meaningless but really offer sound advice. She\nrelates a fairground anecdote from her youth\ncomparing life to a roller coaster and a merry-go-round. An admirable idea, but a little clich ed perhaps.\nEarth Girls Are Easy\nThree aliens are flying over earth in a spaceship when,\nas a result of trying to ogle earth women, they\ncrash land in a backyard swimming pool. Their ship\nneeds repairing so they have to stay on earth for a day or two. Sounds corny? Don't worry, it gets worse.\nThe film starts off with Val (Geena Davis) being\nincreasingly dissatisfied with her fiance, Ted, and\nfinally throwing him out when he brings another\nwoman home thinking Val's away. The ensuing song\nshe sings while she thrashes the house is rather\nmonotonous and totally unnecessary, adding nothing\nto the plot. It merely serves to demonstrate, as does\nan earlier song and dance routine how unsuccessful\nthis film is as a musical.\nThe aliens look like multi coloured gorillas and act\nlike them too, especially when they go into her house\nfor the first time.\nVal takes them to the beauty salon where she\nworks, and asks her friend to try to make them look\nmore human. After momentary hysteria Candy does\nso and Mac (Jeff Goldblum), Wiploc and Zebo emerge\nas three good looking young men. A nice touch is that\nZebo is found to be black.\nSoon Val and Mac start falling in love (well it was\ninevitable, wasn't it?) but when his ship is repaired\nhe will have to go back to his planet, Jhazzala...\nThe plot, if rather hackneyed, did, I feel, have\npotential, but it has been wasted. The film never\nseems to go anywhere-one has the feeling that all\nthe plot elements are incidental -and there is no sense\nof satisfaction at the end.\nThere are a couple of interesting details-for\nexample the size different i a! \u2014a neat way of solving\nthe problem of an apparently large spaceship landing\nin a small backyard swimming pool. There is a device\ninside the ship for scaling the aliens up (or down) to\nthe appropriate size.\nOf course all the old clich es are here, the car chase\n(the monotony of which is only relieved by the humour\nof Jim Carry as Wiploc) the aliens able to mimic every\nsound perfectly, the hair breadth escape and the love\naffair between an earthling and an alien.\nMerely a formula film which doesn't deserve the\ntitle of 'science-fiction'.\nParenthood has a good story line and the subject\nmaterial is dealt with competently-it has its\nmoments, some, (intended to be funny)\nembarrassingly cringe some, others rather amusing.\nAlthough humourous the film has a serious side. It is\njust a pity its overall effect is spoilt by a rather weak\nending, full of marriages, happy-ever-after couples and\nmultitudes of babies.\nJAY.\nLast Exit to\nBrooklyn\nHubert Selby Jr wrote a novel in the 60s which\nshocked the world. It was the source of an obscenity\ntrial which ensured its infamy. This film goes a long\nway towards continuing that reputation.\nSet in Brooklyn in the 1950s the film looks at the\nlives of the strike community~and their social fall from\ngrace. Tackling strike leader Harry Black's( Stephen\nLang) realisation of his homosexuality, the film\nportrays his em be z el ment of union funds and\nsubsequent downfall. Discovered molesting a boy on\nthe street, Harry is brutally beaten up.\nWhat sets this film apart is its refusal to tone down\nsuch scenes. In the case of local prostitute, Tralala\n(Jennifer Jason Leigh) her sad demise ending in a gang\nrape is prot rayed in all its hideous detail.\nThe film cuts between these stories as well as a local family's shotgun wedding and christening and\nthe homosexual affairs of the local transvestite\npopulation. If you are easily shocked this film is not\nfor you. If you are not, at the least you will leave\nfeeling disturbed. With a good film score by Mark\nKnopfler, this could be the nominee for a number of\nOscars, it is expected to face tough competition,\nhowever, from Tom Cruise's performance in Born on\nthe Fourth of July, later this year.\nDS.\nWant to review\n\u2022 Exotic theatre?\n\u2022 Hot films?\n\u2022 Horny music?\nAsk for Adam T, Toby or\nDel in the FELIX Office\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "An interview with Julian Clary after a recent show at the Hackney Empire in aid of the Hackney Ambulance Hardship Fund.\nA sticky moment wit! Julian Clary, also known as Joan Collins Fan Club,\nshot to fame on Saturday Night Live with his dog,\nFanny, and then on Trick or Treat with Mike Smith.\nHis own TV series Sticky Moments proved also to be\na great success, although it has been described as\n'tacky and pointless' by some narrow-minded viewers\nand critics.\nHe has just finished his Mincing Machine tour of\nPage 8\nEngland, concluding with a superb show at the\nGatehouse Theatre in Stafford.\nJustine Mercer caught up with him on December\n14 '89 at the Hackney Empire where he was hosting\na comedy show in aid of the Hackney Ambulance\nHardship Fund, others taking part in the show were\nTom Robinson, Jack Dee, Kit Hollerback, Jungre and\nParker, Arnold Brown and Jeremy Hardy.\nJM: Was Fanny the Wonderdog part of the act then?\nJC: No, she wasn't part of the act until I was\nGillean Pie Face. After Linda went off to be an\nactress, I was on my own so I did an act on my\nown and called it Gillean Pie Face and then after\na few months Fanny worked her way in.\nJM: Did you find that when you first started out you\nwere immediately liked?\nJC: No, I wasn't. \u2022 JM: When did you become 'The Joan Collins' Fan\nClub'?\nJC: I think it was about '83, or was it '84, round\nabout that time anyway. All the stuff that was\nGillean Pie Face was kept in one holdall and it was\nstolen from the back of the van so then I thought\nthat I'd wear clothes that I wanted to wear rather\nthan clothes that I'd got from the Oxfam shop.\nJM: How long have you been working with Russell\nyour pianist and how did you discover him?\nJC: Two and a half years, and I auditioned him.\nJM: Do you prefer working on stage or on television?\nJC: On stage definitely. I'm much more in control\nso it's much more exciting.\nJM: Do your family watch your shows on TV and do\nthey like them?\nJC: Yes, they watch them all and they like them\nall.\nJM: Which show did you prefer filming, 'Trick or\nTreat' or 'Sticky Moments'?\nJC: Sticky Moments because I wrote the material\nfor it as well.\nJM: Have you thought about doing serious acting\never?\nJC: Yes, I 've thought about it, but I don't think\nit would be a good idea.\nJM: Do you think of the ideas for your stage clothes\nor does Michael Ferry, your designer?\nJC: It's usually Michael Ferry, although\nsometimes I say 'I fancy an outfit with t as s les on',\nyou know the old black one with the long t as s les, well that was my idea, but the others are his.\nJM: As well as fan mail, do you receive much hate\nmail?\nJC: I do get some, but I never read it, it's all taken\nout before it gets to me.\nJM: Do you find it strange that you have so many\nfemale admirers and are you flattered by it?\nJC: No, I don't find it strange...and yes, I'm flattered by it.\nJM: What do you enjoy doing in your spare time?\nJC: Well there isn't much of that. I love being at\nhome, staying at home and not going anywhere\nand having a fridge full of food. I like taking the\ndog for a walk and not having anything to do, it's bliss.\nJulian Clary JM: What music do you enjoy listening to?\nJC: T Rex, Patsy Klein, Tom Jones, Erasure,\nHandel's Water Music, Boy George, although I haven't got him on CD. I 've got a couple of his\nalbums which I used to play at lot.\nJM: In which part of the country were you born and\nbrought up?\nJC: I was born in Surbiton in Surrey and when I was seven I moved to Teddington in Middlesex\nand that's where I stayed until I was 18.\nJM: How long have you lived in London?\nJC: Since I was 18, when I started going to\nCollege.\nJM: What sort of school did you go to when you were\na teenager?\nJC: I went to a Catholic public school run by\nBenedictine monks called St Benedicts and it\nwasn't very nice because I was bullied. I didn't like it at all.\nJM: How did your parents react when they found out\nabout your true sexuality?\nJC: Well, I never made any great announcement\nabout it. I'm sure that it dawned on them, they are\nvery, sort of, liberal people so it was no big hassle\nfor them.\nJM: I know that you achieved three 'A' levels and\nwent to university. Which university did you go to and\nwhat did you study?\nJC: It was the University of London and it was\nGoldsmith's College in New Cross and I studied\nDrama and English, BA.\nJM: What jobs did you do before entering the comedy\nscene?\nJC: I didn't do any really, when I left college I was\nunemployed for about two years. I did a cabaret\nact with a friend from college, I was a waiter for\none afternoon and I hated it so much I didn't go\nback, it was in a cafe in Greenwich, I was not\ngood at that. I didn't do anything really.\nJM: What was your first ever comedy act?\nJC: It was called 'Glad and May' with my friend\nLinda from College. It was based on the\ncharacters Amanda and Elliot from Private Lives\nbut also on these two cha-ladies called Glad and\nMay. The opening line was 'Hello, I'm Glad and\nI'm glad to be here', that's what Linda would say,\nthen I'd say 'Hello, I'm May and I may be glad to\nbe here', and we used to do a handbag\ncompetition. You know when I grab somebody's handbag from the audience, well we used to both\ngrab a handbag each and have a competition over\nwho had the most interesting contents.\nJM: I understand that you have become interested in\nre-birthing, can you tell me what this involves and how\nyou first became interested in it?\nJC: Well the girl who used to be my acupuncturist\ngave up acupuncture and then took up re-birthing\nand body harmony as a kind of therapy that she\nwas practising, so I got into it entirely through\nher, and I'd also previously read the Louise Hayes\nbook 'You can hear your life', which is a very\ninteresting book and it talks about re-birthing\nwhich also made me want to try it.\nJM: What actually is it?\nJC: You go to a re-birth er, and it takes about three\nhours, it's a breathing technique and you go into\nan altered state of consciousness and you go on\na strange sort of psychic journey.\nJM: You've also written a book 'My Life With Fanny\nthe Wonderdog' which is h ilia riou s, is it actually based\non fact?\nJC: It's a mixture of fact and fiction, for example\nI was brought up in Teddington but I didn't get\narrested for playing with the pixies at the end of\nthe garden.\nJM: In the book it says you did a Tarzan-a gram, is\nthis true?\nJC: That is true, I was a singing telegram.\nJM: I have also heard, there should be another single\non the way. Is this true.\nJC: Yes, and it should be 'Wandering Star'.\nJM: Although your TV career has now taken off\ndramatically, you have been around for a long time.\nWhy do you think it has taken this long for you to\nbecome well known?\nJC: I think it does take time really, it doesn't ever\nhappen overnight, not unless you've got a very\naccessible talent, mine's a bit odd, you know, it's not of a type. Impressionists, like Rory Bremner,\nget on quicker because it's great TV fodder, and\nit's quite easy and it's been done before. My kind\nof thing was a bit different, a bit off the wall and\nit took longer.\nJM: What would be your ultimate dream for the\nfuture, career wise? JC: To be able to write new material effortlessly.\nI find it very difficult writing and the problem with\nTV is it uses up all of your material, so what I need\nto do is take a few months off in January and\nFebruary to write before I can go out on the road\nagain. This act is all out on video now so it's no\ngood repeating that next spring. I 've been\ncriticised for being repetitive.\nJM: Finally, are you looking forward to spending\nChristmas with your family and have you done all of\nyour Christmas shopping?\nJC: Yes, I am looking forward to it. I haven't even\nstarted my Christmas shopping. I haven't bought\nnobody nuffink.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Desperate Don\nUniversity students are on the whole a stable and\nresilient lot, but very few of them are likely to spend\nthe whole of their student days floating on a sea of\ncalm tranquility. Things go wrong sometimes. The\nkinds of things that go wrong are as varied as human\nlife itself and students are in no way immune to the\ncontingencies of illness, of broken relationships, of\nloneliness and major disturbances as to goals, value\nand meaning. Nor, of course, are they immune from\nworries about money, accommodation and a multitude of other such mundane things either.\nGenerally speaking, students' problems do not in\nthemselves mark them off from their con tempo ries outside university. What is special about the student\nis the degree of impact which such problems can have\nupon his work activity. Academic work, with in-built\ntime limitations, by common consent increasingly\nintense and demanding a sustained high level of\nby Don Adlington\npastoral role, remains the same. Women students\nshould be aware that there is a College Tutor (Mrs\nSandra Dawson in the Management School)\nspecifically appointed to talk to them. Hall and house\nwardens are another group of people who are easily\napproachable-and who would readily accept a first-line responsibility for discussing personal problems.\nFor reasons which may or may not be valid,\nstudents may in some circumstances feel reticent\nabout taking their difficulties to teaching staff. The\nstudent-run Nightline service offers one alternative\nsource of help and support and, besides being totally\nseparate from the College establishment, is available\nwhen other people are not. Similarly the Chaplains\noffer confidential help to all students of the College\nirrespective of religious all eg ien ce. There is no doubt,\nhowever, that the most obvious and conspicuous\nsources of help outside Departments are the Health\nintellectual efficiency, is peculiarly susceptible to the\ndestructive impact of anxiety and distress, whatever\nthe source. In this special sense therefore, students'\nproblems are always urgent.\nIt seems to me that when things go wrong the first\nthing to do is to talk about it, In one sense it doesn't really matter who you talk to, provided that you're (?)\nlistened to. The chance acquaintance in a pub or at\na party might do, or, more likely, a personal friend.\nPeople frequently underestimate, and are\nsubsequently surprised by, the real relief which flows\nfrom sharing one's distress or worry with another\nperson. In the nature of things some students may\nturn as a matter of course to their parents, and indeed\nwhere a problem appears to have long-term\nimplications, most students will not feel at ease until\nthey have taken the family into their confidence.\nSometimes however, these informal sources, of\nsupport may not be available, or sufficient, in which\ncase it may be sensible to approach people in College\nwho have an institutional responsibility for helping\nstudents. The most obvious person is the personal\ntutor, or the departmental senior tutor. Postgraduate\nstudents, and certainly research students are in a slightly different position, but all Departments have\na designated post-graduate tutor, and the basic\nprinciple i.e. that academic staff have inter alia, a Centre; the Student Welfare Adviser, Yve Posner,\nwhose office is in the Union Building; and, in some\ncircumstances, the Student Accommodation Office.\nWhile, clearly, they have different and well-defined\nobjectives, they have in common an express wish to\nbe constructively helpful to the large number of\nstudents who use their services each session.\nThe student counsellor is in a slightly different\n(some would say privileged) position, in that he is, in\nprinciple, employed to do nothing else but talk to\nstudents. For this reason counsellors see far fewer\nstudents than doctors or student services staff, and\nfor the same reason a counsellor's role is much less\nwell understood. This is especially true perhaps in a college of science and technology where a lot of\nstudents-and some of their tutors too-tend to see\nhuman behaviour in rather mechanistic terms. This\nway of looking at things almost always leads to oversimplification of complex situations because it ignores\nthe fundamental fact that we live in a world of feeling.\nWhat dominates our lives, what motivates us, what\nstimulates us, what depresses us, what sustains us,\nare feelings about ourselves and about other people.\nWhen things go wrong for people, in any other than\nthe most trivial matters, the opportunity of expressing\nfeelings, and of having these feelings acknowledge\nby someone else, becomes important.\nStAQ0\n00-Counselling as a technical activity then, is\nprofoundly concerned with the s alien ce of feelings,\nof the emotional infrastructure of human life. It is also\nprofoundly concerned with honesty, and it is this,\nperhaps more than anything else, which distinguishes\na counselling relationship from other relationships.\nCounselling is nearly always friendly, but it isn't friendship. When we talk to our friends or our relatives\nwe are often seeking the comfort of an endorsement\nof our views. We don't really welcome insightful\ncomment, analysis of motive, or any other honest\nreaction, unless it happens to line up with ideas about\nourselves that we have a strong wish not to disturb.\nSuch an aversion to the disturbance of our\npreconceptions is, of course, normal in everyday life.\nThe point is however that at times of crisis it may be\nimportant, for a while at any rate, to look below the\nsurface of what is going on. It is this component of\nm honesty which gives counselling its 'cutting edge',\nand which, by the same token can sometimes make\nit a slightly disconcerting experience, though always,\nI would hope, a supportive one.\nCounselling then is concerned with feelings and\nwith honesty. It is also concerned with confidentiality.\nDiscussions in my office are private, and I am not free\nto talk to tutors, supervisors or indeed anyone else\nabout a student, unless the student himself explicitly\nand fully agrees to it. One implication of this is that\nfrom time to time I have to accept that students will\nchoose to act in ways which would seem to me to\nbe unwise or even potentially disastrous. My job is not\n'solving people's problems'-it is helping people to\nsolve their own. In reality the sources of anxiety and\ndistress may well be things which cannot be changed,\nand the task of the individual may therefore be that\nof making a better shot at adapting to them and\nthereby minim ising the damage they may cause.\nIf there are things you would like to talk about I would be very glad to see you. I can usually see people\nat very short notice and I am easy to contact by phone\non Internal 3041, or by calling at my office on the first\nfloor of 15, Prince's Gardens, immediately next to\nWeek's Hall.\nPage 7\n\n"
