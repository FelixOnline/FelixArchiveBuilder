    "content": "On the 9th of November, the Royal\nCollege of Nursing (RCN) announced\nthe outcome of balloting nursing\nstaff - all NHS employers in Northern\nIreland and Scotland passed the\nlegal threshold for taking industrial\naction. The mandate will run out in\nMay 2023, leaving six months for\ndisruptions in the nursing sector.\nThere\u2019s no reason for them to\nnot strike. In 2019, nursing\nstaff in Northern Ireland\nwon themselves pay\nparity with England and\nWales colleagues. On the\n4th, the RCN released\na report that claims\nthat \u201cpast, current,\nand impending\ng o v e r n m e n t a l\npolicies are causing\nsevere nursing workforce\nshortages, with demand\nfor staff vastly exceeding supply\u201d.\nOver the last ten years, between 8.8%\nand 10.9% of nursing staff have left the\nNHS England nursing register, with\nthis percentage spiking at 11.5% in the\nlast 2021/22 year (after the worst of\nthe pandemic). 56.8% of nursing staff\nwere considering leaving their posts in\n2021. This would not be accepted in\nany other industry. 83% of shifts did\nnothaveenoughstafftobeabletomeet\npatient needs safely and effectively\nin 2022, up from 73% in 2020.\nI realise that majority of us are in\nour prime, and may not necessarily\nrequire the same level of care as our\nparents and grandparents, but this just\nmeans that at the trend we are going,\nthe NHS is bound to crumble before\nthis generation needs the NHS dearly.\nThe Earth\u2019s population is expected to\nreach 8 billion people on the 15th of\nNovember, and by 2050, the World\nHealth Organisation expects that\nthe population of those 60 and over\nwill be 2.1 billion. The standard of\nliving is generally rising (discounting\nthe current cost of living crisis), and\nmany countries are facing staffing\nproblems for an ageing population.\nStaffing internationally is a solution to\nthis problem, but not the best - it costs\nalmost half as much to recruit a Nurse\nf r o m overseas (\u00a36,371.41,\nNHS) than it does\nto replace a fully-trained Nurse (up to\n\u00a312,000, NHS), but\nit costs \u00a38,477.80 to\nrecruit 21 UK Nurses\n(NHS). They might\nnot be fully trained,\nbut they are nurses,\nand they can be trained.\nBoth the Conservatives and\nLabour parties are adamant\nthat their NHS policy should be to\n\u201cbuild five new medical schools\u201d,\nand \u201cdouble the number of medical\nstudents\u201d. This is akin to increasing the\npressure of the water flowing through\na tap, putting a strain on the existing\ninfrastructure, instead of just fixing\nthe growing leak at the bottom of\nthe bucket. Anyone in this economy\nwould call this sort of tactic a waste of\nmoney.

    "content": "Imperial College Rail and Transport Society visited the Old Oak depot in 2020\nFRIDAY 11TH NOVEMBER 2022\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nWith the busy Christmas season\napproaching, TfL has expanded\nits Elizabeth Line operations through\nthe opening of Bond Street Station and\nincreasing the number of running trains.\nThe Elizabeth has been plagued by\ndelays and overruns since its inception\nin 2001, under the name Cross London\nRail Links. The concept of the line was\nnot a new one, as the idea of linking\nPaddington and Liverpool Street\nwas first discussed in 1941. However,\napproval for the current form of the\nrailway was finally given through the\nCrossrail Act in 2008. Construction\nstarted in 2009, with an initial budget of\n\u00a314.8billionandatargetedopeningdate\nof December 2018. These were to prove\noptimistic; the budget was exceeded by\nmore than \u00a33 billion and the opening\ndate was continuously pushed back, first\nto 2019, then 2021, and finally a 2022\nopening date was achieved through the\npartial opening in May.\nThe Elizabeth line was launched with\ngreat fanfare in May 2022. London\u2019s\nnewest \u201cline\u201d saw visits from dignitaries\nincluding the eponymous Monarch, but\nit was not a true opening. The railway\nhad been designed to run a service every\n150 seconds, linking destinations in the\nWest directly to those in the East, via 6\nstations under Central London. Instead\nof this, the service in May was effectively\nthree separate lines \u2013 one running west\nof Paddington, one running north-east\nfrom Liverpool Street, and one running\nthrough Central London out to the east.\nThe frequency of trains was half of the\nplanned rate, and a key interchange \u2013\nBond Street Station \u2013 was not open to\npassengers.\nBond Street has been a particularly\nchallenging problem for the opening of\nthe Elizabeth line. The station was used\nas the exit point for the Tunnel Boring\nMachines (TBMs) that were digging\nthrough Central London. Work on\ncreating the station was unable to start\nuntil tunnelling had been completed\nand the TBMs extracted. Due to the\ninevitable delays in tunnelling work,\nthis was running behind schedule.\nOnce work had begun, a geographic\nfault was found beneath the station,\nwhich resulted in the foundation\ndesign requiring significant changes.\nThese delays had taken construction\ninto the start of 2020, which then\nhad to stop completely with the first\ncoronavirus lockdowns. Restarting work\non a site which had effectively been\nabandoned delayed construction even\nfurther, and coronavirus restrictions\nhampered productivity. Due to these\ncomplications, Bond Street Station\nalone was responsible for \u00a3550 million\nof the overspend on the entire project.\nTfL has finally opened Bond Street\nto the public, offering another route to\none of the busiest shopping regions in\nEurope ahead of the Christmas season.\nAs of last week, the routes the Elizabeth\nLine is offering have been extended\nsignificantly, with trains running\nthrough from west of Paddington \u2013\nincluding Heathrow \u2013 into Central\nLondon and Canary Wharf, and trains\nfrom North East London also able\nto run into Central London. The full\nPaddinton to Shenfield branch also saw\nservices. The frequency has also been\nincreased significantly, with trains every\n3 minutes at peak times, approaching\nthe number promised at the start of the\nproject. In the 6 months since its partial\nopening, 60 million journeys have been\ntaken on the Elizabeth line. With the\nlatest expansion in service, this number\nis expceted to increase significantly.\nWhile full operation (every train able\ntorunthroughthefulllengthoftheroute\nand the expected service frequencies\nreached) is not planned until May 2023,\nthe service now is finally delivering on\nthe mobility promises made during its\ninception.\nShrey Bohra News Writer\nBond Street nightmare ends for\nElizabeth line\u2019s almost-full-open\nCredit: Imperial College Rail and Transport Society\nDo you have an opinion you want to share?\nWhat do you think about The Pantry?\nWhat is your opinion on the strike action?\nWhat should the College and Union be doing to support you?\nGet in touch through our Instagram: @felix_imperial\nP.S.

The\nprizes go to projects that have made major\ncontributions to sustainability, climate\nchange resistance and renewable energy.\nWinners are chosen in five categories and\npraised for their meaningful contribution.\nThe projects that won this year are as\nfollows:\nProtect and restore nature:\nA house of third year Mechanical Engineering students living in Fulham have\nreceived this prize for their astonishing\nrewilding project. In under a year, the\nfour boys were able to turn a reasonably\nsmall and neat back garden into a wildlife hotspot impenetrable to humans. The\njudges commented on their unique \u2018sense\nof the sacred\u2019, saying that none of the boys\nhad stepped foot into the garden since\nthey had begun the project and that their\nphilosophy of unmanaged decline was an\ninspiration to others. Ecologists exploring\nthe site reported bird species thought to be\nextinct in the UK but were not able to find\nthe Converse shoe that got thrown in there\nafter a particularly good sports night.\nClean our air:\nDuring the announcement ceremony for\nthis category a so called \u2018coven\u2019 of witchy\ngirls interrupted proceedings and claimed\nthe prize and money for themselves. They\nhad, they claimed, improved the atmosphere of planet Earth by 500% through\ntheir chanting and crystals. They were,\nthey said, going to spend the prize money\non a huge quartz crystal, that when fully\ncharged in a lunar eclipse would get rid of\nall carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as\nwell as making everyone \u201ca lot queerer\u201d.\nRevive our oceans:\nDespite allegations of greenwashing, this\nprize was awarded to a consortium of\npharmaceutical companies. The group\nclaims that by dumping Viagra into the\noceans, they will be able to increase the\nfertility and fecundity of the fish popu-lations, undoing the damage of years of\noverfishing. Alongside the Viagra, the consortium is also dropping leaflets on topics\nsuch as responsible fatherhood, how to\ngive back massages, and childcare options\nin the local area.\nBuild a waste-free world:\nThis prize was awarded to the group of\nmindfulness and meditation experts behind a newly-founded educational YouTube\nchannel. Through videos, the group has\nbeen teaching the general public to retrain\ntheir perceptions around waste: encouraging them to regard it instead as part of the\n\u2018Dharma\u2019 or \u2018oneness of the universe\u2019.\nTragically, since onboarding this philos-ophy, many of the group have began to\nsuffer from cholera or leukemia. Sceptics\nsuggest that \u2013 whilst they have no wish\nto undermine the group\u2019s pure intentions\n\u2013 perhaps some things really are meant\nto just be regarded as disgusting or use-less. It is hoped that a risk assessment for\nthe group\u2019s daily activities based at their\nheadquarters (situated on top of a nuclear\ndisposal site, downriver from a Thames\nWater outflow pipe) may shine a light on\nthese unforeseen occupational health haz-ards.\nFix our climate:\nThe climate award has been awarded to\nmy dad. He won by default as there were\nno other submissions, the problem being\nso large that no one wanted to even try to\ntackle it. Although his approach (stare at\nthe broken thing, shake it a bit, give it a\nlight kick and walk away) has not yet been\nverified by credible scientists, it is the best\nwe have got at the moment so will have to\ngo with it.\nThe Earthshot Prize reopens for entry\nas soon as the Royals next need to virtue\nsignal.\n\n"

    "content": "London Nightline is an anonymous\nlistening and information service\nrun by students, for students. The\nservice was founded under the name\n\u201cWest London Nightline\u201d in 1971 by\nImperial College students in response to\nthe suicides of three of Imperial students\nthe previous year, with the goal of\nexpanding available wellbeing support.\nUniquely, the service is open all\nthrough the night, when no other\nuniversity welfare services are available.\nThe London service was the second of\nits kind; the first had been established in\nEssexayearearlierbyaformerSamaritans\nvolunteer. The founders realised that\nstudents may prefer to talk to fellow\nstudents than to approach other welfare\nservices, as their peers would have\nbetter understanding of the challenges\nthat university life was presenting.\nWhilst Nightline was established\nwith a clear focus on mental health, the\nfounders recognised that moving to\nLondon in itself can be daunting, and\ntherefore also promoted themselves as\naninformationservice.Evenintheageof\nsearch engines, we remain an invaluable\ninformation source - throughout my\ntime volunteering I have fielded a variety\nof information requests, from student\nfinancial support to the opening times\nof sexual health clinics. Crucially,\nvolunteersdonotofferadvice\u2013weinstead\nanswer every call with an impartial,\nnon-judgemental and empathetic ear.\nFrom no. 8 Prince\u2019s Gardens,\nvolunteers provided confidential\nsupport to students from a growing\nnumber of universities across London.\nThe service became affiliated with more\nand more institutions as its value to\nstudents became recognised. Eventually,\nthe office relocated further into the city\nand was renamed \u2018London Nightline\u2019 to\nreflect this. Today, London Nightline\nis affiliated with 53 institutions.\nNightline was set up in the hopes to\nreduce the number of student deaths by\nsuicide. Whilst this remains a priority,\nlisteners are committed to providing\nnon-judgemental emotional support on\nany topic the caller wishes to talk about.\nIn fact, the majority of calls received\nare not of a suicidal nature, but instead\nencompass a wide variety of topics from\nacademicstresstorelationshipproblems.\nItistheservice\u2019shopethatthroughhaving\nan outlet to openly talk about their\nfeelings without threat of judgement\nor repercussions, fewer students will\nhave their education compromised\nby emotional and mental difficulties.\nThis is especially important as access\nto education has widened. Not only is\nthere now a greater number of students\nacross London, but the diversity of\nstudentbodieshasincreasedaswell.This\nis inevitably accompanied by a greater\nvariety of individual struggles. Nightline\nlistenersaretrainedtoprovideasafespace\nfor these conversations by employing\ncore principles of confidentiality,\nanonymity, and non-directionality.\nAlthough university welfare services\nhaveadvancedoverthepasthalf-century,\ncomplimenting them with charities such\nas Nightline remains as important as\never. In fact, the service even seems to\nbe picking up the slack as universities\nsuffer the repercussions of having not\nincreased their welfare budgets and\nprovisions at the same rate at which\ntheir student bodies have expanded.\nThe provided services are consequently\nunderfunded and understaffed, causing\nlong waiting times and occasional\nreports of a lack of empathy from\ntheir thinly-stretched employees.\nThis is certainly the case at Imperial.\nIn the 2021 National Student Survey,\na student asserted \u201cI found the College\nmental health services to be lacking,\nwith long waiting times and limited\nservices offered.\u201d Indeed, the current\nwaiting time for an initial discussion\nwith the College counselling service\nis a month. The first counselling\nappointment will then not take place\nfor at least another month after that.\nAdmittedly, Nightline volunteers do\nnot offer the guidance which trained\ncounsellors can deliver. However, for\nmany, just talking about the problem\nitself can be a form of therapy. Our\nconversations are directed by the caller\nwho, having been able to describe and\nreason through their feelings without\ninterruption, often concludes the call\nwith a greater sense of clarity. Even\nwhen they don\u2019t, it can be comforting to\nknow that in the middle\nof the night when things\nseem bleak, we are here\nto pick up the phone.\nThe service has of\ncourse had to adapt to the\ntimes. Looking back over\nour 50 years of calls, some\nof the themes serve as time\ncapsules for the era. When\nthe service was starting\nup in the 1970s, the big\nanxiety was nuclear war.\nFor me, I took my first call\nwhen the world was first\nslipping into the grips of\nthe pandemic. Nightline\npromptly transitioned\nonline, enabling us to\nremain open. Some of the\ntoughest calls I\u2019ve ever\ntaken were taken from my\nhome bedroom in those\nfew months \u2013 but the\nharder the call, the more\nglad I was that Nightline\nhad been able to adapt\nand be there for students\nin such challenging, lonely times.\nMeanwhile, some things haven\u2019t\nchanged. The service\u2019s 50 years of success\nis a testament to the underlying belief\nthat students can find solace in open,\nnon-judgemental conversations with\nother students. Furthermore, despite\nthe reduction in the stigma surrounding\nmentalhealth,Nightline\u2019saimtoexpand\nthe quantity of wellbeing support\navailable to students also unfortunately\nremains as relevant as ever. In the face of\nausterity and university cuts to welfare\nbudgets, Nightline is still a much-needed refuge for struggling students.\nThroughout my 500+ hours of\nvolunteering for Nightline, every\ncall I have taken matters. Our 14\nhour shifts can be exhausting both\nemotionally and physically, but every\ntime I put down the phone I am left\nwith a feeling of relief \u2013 and even pride\n\u2013 that I was there to listen that night.\nFRIDAY, 11TH NOVEMBER 2022\n5\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFor the last half-century, London Nightline has\nbeen a port in the storm for university students\nAnonymous Writer\nComment\nDo you want to talk to someone?\nNightlineisopenmostnightsoftermbetween6pmand8am.Weareavailable\nto talk via phone, instant messenger, or email.\nFor more contact information, use the link below:\nhttps://nightline.org.uk/contact-us/\n\n"

    "content": "Last Wednesday, I was sent on an emergency\nmission. Crawlers. O2 Academy Islington. Our\nwriter and Crawlers fan, Amanda, was supposed to\nattend the event in the first place, but she had a last-minute schedule clash \u2013 making our editors hunt for a\nreplacement spectator as soon as possible.\nEnterme,acceptingtogotoagigbyabandwhichhas\nthat very characteristic post-My Chemical Romance\naesthetic that caters to edgy high schoolers. Indeed,\nthat is a weird phenomenon I have noticed during my\npast couple years living in the United Kingdom: a wave\nof emo-adjacent bands which show up left and right\nwith gigs open to ages 14 and over. But a free gig is a\nfree gig, and you have got to step out of your comfort\nzone sometimes.\nI arrived at the venue and immediately noticed the\napprehensive teenagers, by the stage, juxtaposed by a\nbarrier of skeptical moms and dads, leaning against the\nwall with their arms crossed. I strategically chose to be\nin-between both parties, rather off-centred, as I knew\nthat if I went to the middle, this kind of crowd would\nyell at me for being too tall.\nIcaughtacouplesongsfromthefirstopener,Hannah\nGrae, a singer from South Wales who gained a large\nfollowing on TikTok and YouTube \u2013 and wow, what a\nvoice! Along with a power trio, the quartet had a strong\npresence, which is quite rare for a smaller support act.\nTheir cover of \u2018What\u2019s Up?\u2019 by 4 Non Blondes was a\nhighlight, getting everyone warmed up with the crowd\nfavourite.\nNext up, we had Daisy Brain, a project led by Will\nTse, a singer-songwriter-producer-and-blue-haired-romanticbasedinLondon.Thebandcamewithasound\nmuch harsher than Grae\u2019s, and even more energetic.\nWith grungey guitars and heartfelt vocals, Daisy Brain\nput on a contagious, cathartic atmosphere with their\nanthemic choruses, and actually made me wonder if\nthey planned on stealing the show from Crawlers.\nBut I was wrong! The Liverpudlian 4-piece came\non stage with a 13-song setlist, with great sequencing\nand incredible stage presence. The effervescent Holly\nMinto, lead singer and occasional guitarist (and\ntrumpetist!), had amazing chemistry with the crowd,\neven getting me, then unknowledgeable Crawlers-wise,\na bit emotional when listening to the band\u2019s story. They\nwere accompanied by a sharp Liv Kettle on the bass,\na Cobainesque Amy Woodall on the lead guitar and\nan explosive Harry Breen on the drums, the first two\nalso providing backing vocals. Each of them put on an\ngrandiose performance, dominating the stage akin to\nhall-of-fame rockstars, delivering a performance much\nmore abrasive than their studio recordings.\nThe setlist was composed of songs from their 2021\nself-titledEP,tracksfromtheirfreshlyreleasedmixtape\nLoud Without Noise, and even unreleased material.\nIndeed, the track sequencing was divided into three\nacts: the first presenting some of their older songs;\nthen the middle one with their newly released records,\neven the unreleased \u2018Loveless\u2019, and a final leg with their\nmost popular singles. They closed the concert with the\nrelentless but purposeful \u2018I Don\u2019t Want It\u2019, which gets\non your face with a message of frustration about how\nGeneration Z is often self-aware of its bad habits but\nstruggles to change them nonetheless. These \u201cheavier\u201d\nsubjects were present in multiple songs performed\nduring the night, which explains Crawlers\u2019 dedicated\nfanbase (excluding their fascinating social media\npresence): the lyricism is always meaningful, with not a\nsingle track composed of impassive filler. Holly always\nhas something important to say, and her bandmates\ncomplement her crystalline vocals with solid rock\ninstrumentation.\nSo, yeah - thank you, Amanda! My Wednesday\nevening was interesting, to say the least.

Even after playing 27 venues in 7\nweeks, Cassia certainly weren\u2019t lacking energy. I always\nfelt that Cassia produced the sort of joyful music that\nwouldcomealiveinfrontofalarge,receptiveaudience,\nand I was so right. Right from the first track, \u2018Drifting\u2019,\nthe band had everyone in the room jumping with every\nbeat and dancing together.\nCassia gave a particularly captivating performance\nwith a setlist full of fan favourites from across their dis-cography. Though the gig leant primarily on Cassia\u2019s\nhoned musicianship, it was really impressive to see the\nprogression of their sound as they played fan-favour-ites from both their easy-going debut album, Replica,\nand through to their more pop-leaning second al-bum, Why You Lacking Energy?. Whilst it\u2019s true that\nthis evolution means the band has lost some of their\noriginal uniqueness and flair, the crowd reception at\nKOKOprovedtheirsoundisstillsolidandtheirhooks\nare still just as watertight. \u2018Moana\u2019 and \u2018Do Right\u2019 were\nparticular crowd favourites, with Rob Ellis\u2019 acrobatic\nguitar riffs cheerfully running over Jacob\u2019s simmering\nbongos, curating a carefree, sunkissed sound that made\nit easy to feel like you aren\u2019t actually caught in London\u2019s drizzly autumn.\nAs the night progressed, Rob, the lead vocalist and\nguitarist, showed us all just how humble this band are,\nalmost stopping in a moment of awe at how far they\u2019ve\ncome in just a few years.\nTowards the end of the set, Rob and Lou (bass)\ntook up positions on either side of Jacob\u2019s drumkit\nand launched into an impressive, near-tribal drum interval that lead into the delightful reggaeton of \u2018Small\nSpaces\u2019, the opening track from their debut album. All\nof a sudden, keeping both feet still on the ground was\nvery difficult indeed. The moment was visually breathtaking as the band were backed by incredible lighting,\nplaying as silhouettes against a colourful backdrop and\nseveral tropical plants.\nCassia managed to leave the room buzzing after delivering an uplifting, magical performance at KOKO.\nTheir songs were playful and full of character, creating\nan exceptional set for their biggest headline show to\ndate.\nI accepted to go to a concert by a band which clearly does not target my demographic...\nCassia: Live at KOKO\nWritten by Amy Smith Music Writer\nIn their biggest headline gig ever, Cassia returned to London to end their UK and European tour in style at Camden\u2019s KOKO.\n\n"

The mission was covered heavily on the news back in\n2019, so even though you know how it ends, every minute of its nearly\n150min runtime keeps you on the edge of your seat. Farrell delivers an\nincredibly moving performance as the unlikely mission hero. Catch Thirteen Lives on Amazon Prime Video for a thrilling evening full of tears.\n...Irishness\nBelfast (2021, Academy Award Best Picture nominee) depicts the\nlife of an Irish working-class family, as seen through the eyes of their\nyoungest son. The contrast between his innocence and the absurd\nviolence of The Troubles is very powerful. Watch this film if you want\nto be reminded of the beauty of childhood and how to recapture that\nexcitement and lust for life.\nIoana E\u0219anu\nBONUS:\n@filmsoc.ic\nFILM\nAs seasonal depression is upon us, you might be\nlooking for a film to cosy up with. Some of us\nturn to Harry Potter, while others indulge in fluffy\nrom-coms. Writer-director Martin McDonagh has\nother plans: a stark depiction of life on a remote Irish\nisland, with its daily meaninglessness, dull residents,\nand miserable weather.\nBut perhaps it\u2019s not all that\nbad. The film teeters between\ntwo fundamental views\non this lifestyle: either a\ngrey limbo in which one\npatiently awaits death, or a\npeaceful oasis with green\npastures, gentle animals,\npints at 2PM, and\nnot a care in\nthe world.\nThe two\nl e a d\na c t o r s\na r e\na lmost\npersonifications of the two views. Colin Farrell plays\nP\u00e1draic S\u00failleabh\u00e1in (I dare you to try and pronounce\nthat), a happy-go-lucky guy whose serene existence gets\nshaken to the core as the story unfolds. On the other\nside is the morose Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson),\nlong-time friend and fiddle enjoyer. The premise of the\nfilm, according to IMDb, is: \u201cTwo lifelong friends find\nthemselves at an impasse when one abruptly ends their\nrelationship, with alarming consequences for both\nof them\u201d. Despite its many qualities, the film fails to\ndeliver on this mysterious intrigue, leaving something\nto be desired.\nThe performances are stellar, with memorable\nappearances from Kerry Condon (of Breaking Bad and\nBetter Call Saul fame) and Barry Keoghan (the latest\nJoker). All in all, the film creates a fascinating tapestry\noflifeinrural1920\u2019sIreland,fromthedeeply-ingrained\nmoral values of the village, to the interpersonal\nrelationships and daily struggles. The level of detail\nand sensibility is commendable, but I wish I could say\nthe same about the plot. Questions of loneliness and\ndepression are raised, as well as the eternal \u201cmeaning of\nlife\u201d debate, as the seemingly simple characters reveal\ntheir secrets and aspirations. Thought-provoking,\nmoody, and very Irish, The Banshees of Inisherin is\na potential Oscar\ncontender, but not\nthe most exciting f i l m\nyou\u2019ll watch this year.\nCredit: Searchlight Pictures\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 11TH NOVEMBER 2022\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nClimatechange,COVID-19,andthe\nRussia-Ukraine war have caused\ngreat damage to global food production\nandsupplynetworks,increasingnotonly\nfoodpricesbutalsothecostsoffuelsand\nfertilisersthatareessentialforproducing\nfood. While developed countries are\nsufferingthroughhistoricallevelsoffood\ninflation, people in developing countries\nare dying of hunger and malnutrition. In\nthiscriticalsituation,GMcropshavethe\npotential, if applied correctly, to solve\nthe current food crisis in a relatively\nshort period. The genetic enhancements\nare plenty and highly attractive, from\npest resistance to increased nutrient\ncontent. However, there is also lots of\ncontroversy surrounding GM crops,\nwhich caused them to be under heavy\nlaw regulation for their development\nand commercialisation.\nA specific example of risk\nassessment in GM crops\nBt crops (e.g., corn, cotton) can\nproduce crystal proteins that are toxic\nexclusively to certain pest insects, and,\nin theory, not to other living beings.\nThis ability came from the insertion of\nthe gene encoding the crystal protein\nfrom a soil bacterium called Bacillus\nthuringiensis. The usage of Bt crops\nsince 1996 has saved us 400,000 tonnes\nof insecticides, which are expensive and\npolluting. Furthermore, in contrast to\nconventional insecticides, Bt crops do\nnot harm non-target insects like bees\nas the crystal proteins are only toxic\nif ingested. However, there are issues\nassociated with the consumption safety\nof Bt crops. The crystal proteins are in a\nlatent stage and only become activated\nafter being metabolised in the basic\nenvironment of the insect gut. The\nactive crystal proteins then break down\nthe walls of the gut, which allows the\nliberation of the alkaline gut juices into\nthe hemolymph (the \u201cblood\u201d of insects).\nThisincreasesthehemolymphpH,which\ncauses the paralysis and ultimately death\nof the insect. There remains concern\nabout potential harmful effects of the\ncrystal proteins on humans, as there are\nsome studies pointing out damage to\nthe human gut epithelium by the crystal\nproteins. However, this is a controversial\ntopic with different views even within\nthe scientific community. As human and\ninsect guts are different from each other,\nthe crystal proteins do not have the same\neffect: the gut of the human does not get\nperforated nor does its blood become\nalkaline. There might be unknown long-term effects, but these are quite hard to\nspot due to time issues. It is important to\nremember the idea that there is no such\nthing as a universal toxin because toxins\nneed to be metabolised in a particular\nwaytobecometoxic,andthemetabolism\nof each living being is different. Now,\nit would be na\u00efve to believe that the\ncrystal proteins do not have any effect in\nhumans. Chemical compounds always\nhave an effect inside living organisms;\nwe just do not know the effect very well\nyet. However, the following point I am\ngoing to make can be applied to any type\nof discussion regarding not only GM\ncrops but almost anything in science:\nthereisalwaysariskofnegativeeffects\u2014\nthat is unavoidable\u2014but what we must\ndo is assess the benefits and risks of\neach GM crop to conclude whether\nit is worth it or not. The reason is that\nthe genetic modifications of each GM\ncrop have different pros and cons, and\nalso have different contexts. Sometimes,\nthe pros will outweigh the cons in a\nparticular context and vice versa. If we\nwant to solve the food crisis, we should\nanalyse the pros, cons, and context of a\nparticular GM crop instead of tagging it\nas bad or good.\nPlant breeding is not enough\nFarmers have been modifying the\ngenome of crops through selective\nbreeding almost since the invention of\nagriculture. Some environmentalists\nadvocate for relying exclusively on\nselective breeding rather than genetic\nengineering or a combination of both\nbecause the \u201cnatural way\u201d is the best one\nandweshouldnotunderestimatenature.\nHowever, they do not usually consider\nthe biological limitations that selective\nbreeding has, which cannot be overcome\nexcept with genetic engineering. First of\nall, genetically crossing different plants\nover and over again to obtain a desirable\nvariety is time consuming mainly\nbecause plants take time to grow\u2014time\nthat we do not have if we want to avoid\na humanitarian catastrophe. Secondly,\nselective breeding is not a precise\nenough method, as the transmission\nof genes from generation to generation\ndoes not occur one gene at a time, but\nin chunks of genes that are often passed\naltogether. This means that we could get\nnon-desirable genes that make our crops\ngrow slower or taste worse apart from\nthe desired gene.\nCurrent debates are centralised on\nwhether GM crops are bad or good,\nnot leaving space for grey areas. In my\nopinion, we should instead focus on\nthe risk assessment of each GM crop in\nparticular according to scientific data\nand implementation challenges. I have\nalso explained why limiting ourselves to\nthetraditionalmethodofplantbreeding\ncannot solve the current food crisis.\nUltimately, advocates of GM crops\nshould not criticise the negative points\nof detractors without also taking the\npositive ones into account. This same\nreasoning also applies to the detractors.\nThe day we start opening discussions\nbetween both sides, and analys each GM\ncrop according to its unique context,\nis the day we can potentially solve the\ncurrent food crisis.\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nangie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience\nThe missing point in the GM crops debate\nAdvocates and detractors continue to debate whether GM crops are \"good\" or \"bad\". Staff Writer\nWang Guo says we should instead consider each crop in its own unique context.\nTHERE IS\nALWAYS A RISK\nOF NEGATIVE\nEFFECTS - WHAT\nWE MUST DO\nIS ASSESS THE\nBENEFITS AND\nRISKS OF EACH\nGM CROP\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP IT FREE\n4 Felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nLetter to the Editor\nThislettermentionssensitivetopicssuchaspoormentalhealth.Pleaserefertohttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/student-supportzone/, or the Samaritans, if you need support.\nDear Editor,\nI was excited about Imperial and London. Although it was lockdown time, as a south-east Asian student who never got the\nchance to study abroad, this was my time. As a mentally disabled person, it was not easy, especially securing scholarships with\nappeal after appeal. I survived Imperial and London with my friend\u2019s and family\u2019s money.\nThe excitement was short-lived when during the first quarter of my postgraduate study, I was busy with paperwork for my\ndisability accommodation. Of course, I understand there are processes to follow. But I got overwhelmed and plunged into a\ndeep depression again, and I isolated myself except for discussions I needed to attend with my course-mates.\nMy therapist, psychiatrist, and GP were all aware of my condition, as well as the Disability Advisory Service. I followed all\nthe rules; I complied with every treatment. But Imperial\u2019s flawed system for a disabled person like me made me underperform\nduring the pandemic, and I received terrible reviews from my classmates. Of course, I told the department about my disability.\nYet I was never asked \u201cwhat we can do for you so that this study process would be easier for you?\u201d. My tutor advised me to take\na break instead of investigating what she could do as a tutor.\nWe had a Facebook Messenger group chat. One day the student representative presented the report from a meeting with the\ndepartment. A girl asked about how her disability has made her study troublesome, and a member of the department answered,\n\u201cit\u2019s not our job to\u2026\u201d. Whatever was said, the department could use another word and not dismiss people like us.\n50% of the study was online, so it was scary being disabled without sufficient support living in London. Then it came time\nto have an important meeting with our tutor. Each of us needed to present our proposal dissertation. I gave my presentation,\nwhere one of my platform studies was Twitter. My tutor candidly asked me, \u201cDo Malaysia people see Twitter?\u201d. As much as my\nfamily and relatives thought I was smart, I was speechless and dumbfounded. How could she say something so offensive? It was\n2020 and this is the social media era.\nThereweretwomodulesIneededtobemadeawareIcouldhaveare-sitfor.Sadly,Iwasnotawareoftherules.Ofcourse,they\nwill say, \u201cYou need to read the guidebook\u201d. If that is the case, I do not think they were sincere in helping the disabled person.\nAs a disabled student, I had trouble reading and writing, let alone reading the guidebook. Were the college not supposed to be\nsmart?\nAt that point, I gave up asking for any support from my department unless, for mitigating circumstances, I had to apply for\nmodules I had to take. I did not trust my department anymore. Please be noted that I have issues with my department. Not my\nprofessors that have taught me. They were awesome!\nWhen I received my official mark, my mark was borderline. I applied for appeal and uplift for classification (pass, merit, or\ndistinction). However, this was a tricky thing to do. I did not have the strength to read the comments and reply to them. Not\nbecause I could not handle the truth but because I was traumatised by their template-robotic answers that are cold and do not\nshow any care. Of course, my appeal got rejected. Which meant another long process of traumatising paperwork, which I only\nmanaged to get halfway through (this took six months) after I overdosed twice because of this appeal. I felt so burdened and\noverwhelmed that I needed to explain and prove myself and my sickness again and again, since even before I arrived at Imperial.\nI wish they could see me striving for my disability and always committed to studying. I wish they knew that I have trouble\nreading and writing. I wish they knew they had to do more to support me during the lockdown. I hope they know that I need\nto work 100 times harder.\nIt was not about the grades when I appealed. It was about justice. It was about why they did not want to be the ones who lent\nhands. Why people like me always had to ask first. I applied for mitigating circumstances for each module I took. Did they not\nrealise I needed support? I seek Felix, not for revenge, but because I hope that by this reveal, they will realise that they need to\nwork harder to support us, the students. Remember Imperial professor Grimm\u2019s death in December 2014? Imperial really does\nnot get it.\n\n"

    "content": "amazingly crafted film on its own, Even when you remove the supernatural elements, at its core it is a family\ndrama centred around the consequences of not dealing\nwith unresolved generational traumas, as it is clear that\nthe conflict felt by Annie towards her mother is seeping into her struggle to maintain a healthy relationship\nwith her family.\nToni Collette herself, in an interview with Vulture,\nsaid, \u201cIt\u2019s a very honest, natural portrayal of a family\nexperiencing a lot of pain and how it changes them.\u201d\nProducer Lars Knudsen added: \u201cThe film still works\nas a family drama. At its core, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\nand I feel that the horror movies that stand the test of\ntime are the ones that have something to say about the\nhuman condition.\u201d I believe both statements are true.\nWhat makes this film not only a phenomenal horror\nfilm, but a brilliant film regardless is that it does not\ncling to a genre and refuses to deviate from it. The film\nhas something to say about how a family grieves, how\ngrief can bring together or break a family down, and\nyes, how it \u201cchanges them,\u201d almost representing the\ngrief and loss as the real terror, the real horror:\nOnesceneinparticularthatpulledattheheartstrings\nwasanemotionalsceneatthedinnertablewhereAnnie\nand her son relay all of their feelings after the tragedies\nthe family has faced up to this point. The scene\nreveals the anger Annie feels towards her\nson at times, which she tries to repress\nbecause it is her son, and the guilt\nher son makes her feel for tragedies\nthat have taken place. The emotions felt by them finally reach a\nboiling point, and my goodness,\nthat scene consisted of some of\nthe finest acting I have ever\nseen. Both actors made you\nfeel and cling onto every\nword they were saying\nas if you were there at\nthat dinner table. This,\nalong with the lack of\nnon-diegetic sounds as\nthey both speak, made\nit even more chilling\nand real. Both Toni\nCollette and Alex\nWolff deserve all\nthe awards for\nthat scene alone.\nThat was a\nvery emotional,\nchilling scene\nt h a t\nfelt almost too real, but that\u2019s the point, as Ari Aster\nsaid: \u201cIt\u2019s related to certain things that happened in\nmy life and things that my family and I went through\ntogether, But the movie itself is all invention. The feelings behind the film are personal.\u201d The film is meant\nto speak to families about not allowing grief to break a\nfamily apart, but to bring them together. And that dinner scene only accentuates that message; as even Annie\nherselfsaysinthefilmthatifonlythegrieftheywereall\nfeeling could have \u201cbrought us together.\u201d\nThe same demons and spirits that the film mentions\nare there not only to inject the horror element, but\nas metaphors; they represent the demons that plague\nfamilies across all generations, leading to transgenera-tional trauma, with these demons being specific to the\nunresolved issues being passed down or weaponized\nfurther down the family tree, for example, leading to\nindividuals dealing with grief in unhealthy ways. Maybe because that is all they have known from their par-ents.\nNo words could fully express how much I loved and\nappreciated this film. One of the many reasons I am\nappreciative is because it restored my hope in horror\nfilms and their potential, by not using stereotypical supernatural horror tropes as the main plot driver, rather by making those elements almost secondary to the\nreal-world messages the film has for the human condi-tion, and I believe that is how it should be.\nAri Aster, the producers, Toni Colette (it is very unfortunate that she did not get an Oscar for her role),\nAlex Wolff, Milly Shapiro, Gabriel Byrne, and all the\nactors and the team truly created something special\nwith this film, and I 100% believe it will and should\nstandthetestoftime,astomenootherhorrororthrill-er film comes close to this. This is truly a masterpiece\nand a must-watch!\nFRIDAY 11TH NOVEMBER 2022\n13\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFILM\nRecommendations from the Editors\nCast aside your courseworks, dear readers; here are some film recommendations from the\neditors for you to watch on UK Netflix right now!\nIn Bruges\nFrom the same director and basically the same\ncast as The Banshees of Inisherin (see Ioana\u2019s\nreview), this is a brilliant dark comedy about Irish\nhitmen in Belgium that will have you shamefully\nchortling to yourself throughout.\nPrincess Mononoke\nStudio Ghibli\u2019s back catalogue being put on Netflix\nis the best thing to happen to streaming since\ngroundwater springs. You can start anywhere, but\nfew capture the majesty Ghibli brings to a story\nbetter than Princess Mononoke.\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Cabinet of Curiosities\nAn eight-part horror miniseries in the style of Black Mirror, with each episode presenting\nits own tale of spine-tingling spookiness. del Toro himself features as a co-writer on two of\nthe episodes, with the rest being written and directed by a menagerie of talented horror\nveterans.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nHereditary: A modern day masterpiece\nPrior to Hereditary being released in 2018, my view\nof horror films was not very positive. I was tired of\nstereotypical plots, predictable jump scares, and stock\ncharacters lacking any substance or depth. That being\nsaid, it does not mean I did not enjoy films like Scream\nor Insidious, I enjoyed them for what they were and\nappreciated the work put into them, but they only reaffirmed my belief that horror films were becoming more\nand more predictable as time went on, as if there were\nsome unwritten code for how all horror films should\nbe.\nThen one late night in 2018, I watched Hereditary, and my mind was changed forever. This film sin-gle-handedly broke all my conceptions about the horror genre and redefined what a horror and thriller film\ncould be. Hereditary is a family driven psychological\nhorror and thriller that is even scarier than your standard horror film because it feels closer to reality. It deals\nmore with complex human emotions with a focus on\nhow we all grieve differently, as well as focusing on the\nhorrors of unresolved transgenerational traumas. I find\nthat scarier than continuous jump scares and predictable plots to invoke fear.\nWhen watching Hereditary, you don\u2019t feel far re-movedfromthecharactersbecauseyoucanseeyourself\nin them. We all have dealt with grief or know someone\nwho has, so we can see how it can disrupt your actions\nand mess with your mind. The A.V. Club stated when\ntalking about Hereditary that \u201cit grips you with the real\nhorror, the unspeakable kind,\u201d and I believe those horrors are the horrors that arise from unresolved issues\nwithin us, and that is the scarier kind. However, don\u2019t\nget me wrong, Hereditary is still laced with lots of supernatural elements and jump scares that still freak you\nout. They are layered throughout the film, and these elements are key for the plot of the story, but they are not\nthe story; the supernatural elements work in line with\nthe way the different family members handle their grief\nand how this grief leads to generational supernatural\nhorrors being unveiled.\nSaxophonist Colin Stenson\u2019s musical score creates a\nsense of uneasiness throughout the film, as if there is\nsome evil lurking around waiting to show itself. In an\ninterview, Colin Stenson avoided the conventional use\nof certain instruments to invoke evil, such as \u201cstrings\u201d\nand \u201csynths,\u201d instead using clarinets or his voice, all to\nfollowthethemethedirectorandwriterwanted,which\nwas for the music to \u201cfeel evil.\u201d Stenson also mentioned\ntreating the music as if it were \u201cits own character\u201d that\nhas relationships with the other characters, and as the\nnarrative unfolds, the sense of evil continues to unfold,\nall the way to the explosive final act.\nHereditary is an A24 film and was written and directed by Ari Aster, with it being his directorial debut.\nToni Colette (an Oscar-worthy performance) plays\nAnnie Graham, an artist, who is grieving the loss of her\ndifficultandcomplicatedmother(playedbyKatheleen\nChalfant) while trying to keep the family together\namid their grief, as her daughter (an eerie and chilling\nperformance from Milly Shapiro) was especially close\nto her grandmother. As Annie explores more about her\nancestry, strange things start to happen.\nAfter another family tragedy, Annie struggles even\nmore to keep her family together amid their personal grief, which leads to a search for answers in\nher own grief that rattles her family tree, inviting more supernatural horrors and leading to a\nterrifying and phenomenal final act.\nToni Colette delivers a tour de force in\nacting, a literal masterclass in acting as Annie Graham, and she is terrifyingly convincing at portraying\na conflicted mother, wrestling with complex emotions\nupon the death of her own mother. It is amazing how\nCollette can make you feel so much in one scene, from\nempathy to fear to solidarity with her as she is dealing with the experience of grieving for someone who\nyou are not sure you really loved, and the complexity\nof emotions that Collette portrays only gets deeper\nthroughout the film. She portrays Annie flawlessly, and\nAnnie remains my favourite horror film character and\nis one of my favourite roles that Toni Collette has ever\nplayed (if it\u2019s not clear yet, Toni Colette is one of my\nfavourite actresses).\nDespite her strained relationship with her\nmother, she is still grieving, while trying\nto maintain a relationship with her\nhusband (wonderfully played by\nGabriel Byrne), her son (another\ntour de force in acting by Alex\nWolff), and her daughter.\nEven then she hides away\nfrom them, reminiscing\non the past by creating\ndollhouse-like models of her mother,\nshowing that the\npast in turn is affecting her present relationship\nwith her family.\nThis is why,\nas much as Hereditary is a\nphenomenal\nhorror and\nthriller, it\nis more\nt h a n\nthat; it is\nan\nCaleb Eferakorho FilmSoc Writer\nFor their Halloween special screening, FilmSoc watches the film that changed the horror landscape forever\nFilmSoc Screening Review\nVERY CHILLING WITH AN\nUNABASHED SENSE OF DREAD\nTHROUGHOUT; YOU FEEL\nEMPATHETIC BUT HELPLESS.\n\u201c\n- FilmSoc Member\nA METICULOUSLY ACTED AND\nEXCEPTIONALLY WELL-DIRECTED\nCINEMATOGRAPHIC EXPERIENCE.\nCOLLETTE DELIVERS A POWERFUL\nPERFORMANCE, WHICH ASTOUNDS\nVIEWERS UNTIL THE VERY FINAL\nSCENE.
