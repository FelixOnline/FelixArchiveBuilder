They\u2019re\nstraightforward, relatively\npredictable, and often\nmore empathic than\npeople. It\u2019s probably why\nBobby, played by producer Linus Karp, chose to\nlose his virginity to a dog\nhe picked up on his way\nhome from a party. But\nwhat possesses a man to\nopt for bestiality over, say,\nTinder? That\u2019s the question posed by Rob Haye\u2019s\nAwkward Conversations\nwith Animals I\u2019ve F*cked.\nOver the course of an\nhour and through five\nconversations (I use the\nterm loosely due to a lack\nof reply from his animal\ncounterparts), we see not\nonly Bobby\u2019s growth from\nan awkward first-timer to\na one-man animal-liber-ator-and-romancer army,\nbut also the past that led\nhim to take this dark and\nlonely path.\nversations with his animal\ncompanions, a move that\nwas initially jarring but\nmade sense, given the\ndelusional nature of his\npersonal reality. It even\nunderlies his actions and\nbehaviour when accessing\nthe stage. There\u2019s none of\nthat pacing or ownership\nthat we typically see of a\none-man show, instead,\nBobby looks just as\nuncomfortable and as out\nof place in his own bed as\nthe woods he eventually\nends up in.\nKarp does a wonderful\njob of portraying Bobby as\nan awkward, reclusive ad-olescent. There\u2019s initially\na wide-eyed innocence\nand Michael Cera-esque\ngawkiness to his conduct\nthat runs counter to\nhis bitter cynicism and\nresentment he displays\nwhile talking about his\nhuman peers. It\u2019s chilling,\nthe casual flip between\npost-coital small talk and\nthe lashing out at society\nas a whole and it is the\nlatter, darker aspect of his\npersonality that is given\nthe most space to grow\nthroughout the show.\nWhere Awkward Conversations runs a little flat\nis its comedy, which I was\nslightly disappointed by.\nWith a name like that, I\nwas expecting great things\nbut the humour, while\nalways a welcome relief\nfrom such earnest subject\nmatters, is often a bit too\nknowing for someone\nwho is so fully involved\nwith his own delusions.\nIt\u2019s also not quite enough\nto really lift the progressively dark narrative\nBobby is led down.\nAwkward Conversations with Animals I\u2019ve\nF*cked is a powerful and\nunsettling exploration of\nloneliness and how one\nman tries to deal with his\nisolation without a role\nmodel or the support he\nneeded. In many ways,\nit\u2019s the origin story of\nbullies, misogynists, and\nincels, just with added\nheavy petting.\nSex, Drugs, and Murder on the Heath\nW\ne meet\nA n t h o n y\n( C i a r \u00e1 n\nOwens), a\nmanjustshyofthirty-three\n(as he fond of telling us)\nat his arrival at a chemsex\nparty. He is a seasoned\npro, bantering with Ian\nHallard\u2019s accountant who\nis in charge of metering\nout the GBL doses mixed\nin with apple juice or\nlucozade. Just when he is\nabout to chat up a potential\nhook-up, Anthony\u2019s night\nis interrupted by the\nghost of George (Harry\nLister Smith), a past fling.\nGeorge, barely twenty\nand was infatuated with\nAnthony, has recently\ndied of a purported\noverdose on Tumulus, a\nhill on Hampstead Heath.\nOnly, there is more to his\ndeath than the Ham&High\nwould care to report;\nGeorge reveals toAnthony\nthat he was murdered,\nand implores his ex-lover\nto find his killer. Thus\nbegins Anthony\u2019s quest\nthrough North London to\nfind a missing necklace\nand justice for a man, for\nwhom, despite himself, he\nwas beginning to develop\nfeelings.\nAs Anthony meets\nwith exes, police officers,\npotential love interests,\nand Scottish aunts who\nknow more than they\nseem, Hallard and Lister\nSmith zoom around the\nstage playing dozens of\nroles each. They are also\nthe special effects crew:\nas Anthony suffers withdrawal symptoms and\ncrippling anxiety, Owens;\nsupporting castmates\ncreate great clangings of\nmetal against metal by\nbanging scissor blades\ntogether. When Anthony\nstumbles through the\nHeath, pursued by an\nassailant, Hallard sprays\nsmoke at his feet. In the\nintimate Soho Theatre,\nwhere the audience sits\nmere inches from the\naction, this staging feels\nelectrifyingly visceral.\nChristopher Adams\u2019s\nscript is arch; taking particular aim at the hypocrisies of well-to-do of the\nNorth London gay society.\nAt a birthday gathering\nthat Anthony attends at\nhis ex-boyfriend\u2019s house,\nthe well-heeled guests\ntake swipes at each other\nover painfully mid-dle-class food (\u201clozenges\nof champagne jelly\u201d\nfeature). For all the play\u2019s\nfizzing humour, Adams\nhas much to say about the\ndarker aspects of these\nmen\u2019s lives. None of his\ncharacters are happy, all\nare seeking intimacy with\nother men in ways that\ndon\u2019t involve drugs and\nsex, yet none can really\nget there, all live in world\nwhere no one really cares\nabout boys dying alone in\nthe middle of the night in\na London park. Even for a\nself proclaimed noir, it is\nunusually bleak.\nTumulus\u2019 grittiness\nmakes for an engaging\nthriller, but it is also its\nundoing. This is a play\nalmost entirely devoid\nof tenderness; while it\u2019s\none-liners were barbed\nenough to deliver laughs\nand polished performances from all three of its\nactors, I was never fully\nable to fully emotionally\ninvest in any of the char-acters. With an ending\nthat is mechanical in tying\nup the mystery but does\nlittle to provide character\ngrowth or any redemptive\narc. The darkness in\nwhich Tumulus revels,\nfeels less hard-hitting\nthan more and more\nbanal with every snarky,\nunhappy line.\nBear-ly Legal // Simon J Webb\nARTS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Now\nin its 9th year running, the\nLondon Coffee Festival\nis a massive celebration\nof everyone\u2019s favourite\nstimulant. And when I say\nmassive, I mean massive.\nWith four floors and over\n250 stands, there\u2019s enough\ncoffee packed into one\nspace to make a herd of\nelephants jittery.\nThe amazing thing\nabout the festival is how\nit covers every step of\ncoffee consumption. First\nthe beans, of course.\nAn immense range of\nsingle origin beans from\nEthiopia to Indonesia,\nlovingly prepared by\nroasteries from Cornwall\nto Birmingham. And\nthen the machines. The\nlatest and greatest in cof-fee-making technology is\non display here.\nTraditional brands like\nChemex to Hario. Wonderful new gadgets like\na liquid nitrogen aeration\ndevice from Austria.\nWant milk in your\ncoffee? Not a problem.\nThere\u2019s specialty dairy\nmilk from farms like\nBrades Farm, expressly\nformulated for the most\nsilky texture. Or if you\nwant to go dairy-free,\nthere\u2019s a whole plethora\nof options. Soy, almond,\nlactose-free, even macadamia - the possibilities\nare endless!\nIt\u2019s great. Maybe it\u2019s\n\u201cEnough\ncoffee... to\nmake a herd\nof elephants\njittery\u201d\nmasterclass on the use\nof nitro cold brew (that\u2019s\nnitrogenated cold brew,\nwhich comes \u2018on tap\u2019 and\nlooks much like a nice\nstout) in cocktails - the\ncold brew mojito is amazingly smooth. A subtle\nkick from the coffee and\nthe acidity pairs nicely\nwith the lime juice.\nThe London Coffee\nFestival is clearly a place\nfor industry / coffee-shop\nowners to find their feet -we even pass an interior\ndesign stall specialising\nin the light wood, ex-posed-filament lightbulb\ncoffeeshop vibe - but for\nthe amateur coffee enthusiast it\u2019s a fantastic peek\ninto the world of professional coffee brewery. I\nhave an intense discussion\nwith a barista about the\nlightness of \u201c3rd wave\ncoffee\u201d versus traditional\nroasts which apparently\nhave \u201cmore crema,\nslight bitterness and less\nacidity\u201d. Another waxes\nlyrical about the benefits\nof an machine with double\nboilers - one for espresso\nextraction and a separate\none for milk foaming,\nso you have \u201cprecise\ncontrol over the milk\ntemperature\u201d. Chatting to\nthe baristas and roastery\nowners, it\u2019s so inspiring\nto see their passion for\nour humble caffeinated\nbeverage. Who knew so\nmuch thought and effort\ncould go into a simple cup\nof coffee? - Claire Chan\nthrough purchasing cof-fee-related art. Admirably,\n50% of all ticket sales\nto The London Coffee\nFestival and sales of\nart go towards Project\nWaterfall, the charitable\ncomponent of UK Coffee\nWeek that aims to deliver\nsafe drinking water and\nsanitation projects for up\nto 100,000 people, specifically in coffee-producing\ncountries in Africa. There\nwas art made using\ncoffee, art focussing on\nthe importance of coffee\nin getting us through the\nday (no one can contest\nthat). There were also\nsome very trippy ones\nthat mimicked the effect\nof a brain saturated with\ncaffeine \u2013 which, I can\nassure you, was rather ef-fective: it made you doubt\nwhether the painting was\nmimicking double vision,\nor whether it was the\neffect of caffeine on my\nrather addled brain.\nOne of the highlights\nof the festival must be\nthe famed Coffee Masters\ncompetition. With the\n16 best baristas from\naround Europe pitched\nagainst each other in 8\ndisciplines, the knockout\ncompetition is judged\nby a panel of industry\nfigureheads with a \u00a35000\nprize and the prestigious\ntitle of Coffee Master at\nstake. The first round was\n\u2018The Cupping\u2019 \u2013 where\ncompetitors had to guess\nthe single origin of 6 different cups of coffee. And\nwho knew coffee tasting\ncould be so intense \u2013 each\ncompetition took a tiny sip\nout of a spoon, swirled it\naround in their mouth, and\npromptly spat it out into a\nbucket. As much as I love\ncoffee, I doubt I could\ntell you the difference\nbetween a Guatemalan\nand a Costa Rican roast,\nor one from Myanmar vs.\nBrunei. Secondly, a wheel\nwas spun to determine the\nmethod of brewing coffee.\nThe contestants then\nhad to select \u2018the right\ncoffee\u2019 to suit the brewing\nmethod, and be quizzed\nintensely by the judges\nas to the reasons behind\ntheir choices and type of\nflavour profile they were\naiming for. The Latte Art\ndiscipline then pitched the\ncompetitors against each\nother on visual appearance\nof the pattern, milk quality\nand contrast \u2013 which I had\nnever considered before.\nThe experience and\nexcitement of watching\nworld-class baristas go\nhead-to-head in mastering\nthe subtle and complex\nart of perfecting that brew\nwas a memorable one\nindeed.\nThrough wandering the\nstalls and conversing with\nbaristas and stall-owners,\nthere were a few stalls\nthat imparted some words\nof wisdom to us. The\nowner of \u2018Ngopi coffee\u2019\nenthusiastically told us\nabout how coffee beans\nare not intrinsically \u2018good\u2019\nor \u2018bad\u2019 based on their\ncountry of origin, with\nvariation even within individual farms. Instead, the\ntype of roast and brewing\nmethod has a large impact\non the flavour profile. We\nalso learned from a caf\u00e9\nand school in Shoreditch\nthat their name \u20187 Grams\u2019\nis the perfect weight of\nbeans used in an espresso.\nWhilst sampling a delightful and rich espresso\nfrom them, we found out\nthat the process of coffee\nmaking goes through at\nleast 40 people before\nreaching us - farmers,\nquality control, grinders,\nbaristas and many more.\nFinally, \u2018Curtis coffee\u2019\nhad a unique concept\nof simplifying the types\nof coffee into different\ntypes \u2013 sweet, bright, and\ncomplex. Their owner,\nwith 7 years of experience\nunder her belt, will then\nfind the best single origin\nbeans to match the flavour\nprofile, and we are consumers trust her palate to\nfind and roast that perfect\ncoffee.\nOverall, the Coffee\nFestival was a friendly,\nbuzzing and caffeine-lad-en experience that I\nwould love to revisit. It\nalso opened up a new\nworld of coffee-making\nto us: it showed us the\nlengths which baristas go\nto hone their craft, and\nthe passion they have for\ncreating that perfect cup.\nSo many different aspects\nare involved, from considerations about brewing\nmethod, milk and water\ntemperature, grind of the\nbean, weight of the coffee,\nlength of time brewing\nand even the types of\nwater used. Mastering that\nperfect balance of bitter-ness, body, sweetness and\nflavour notes is something\neach coffee connoisseur\naspires to achieve, and the\ncomplexity of good cof-fee-making is something\nI have a newfound appreciation for. - Elizabeth\nThong\nTumeric Latte anyone? // James Bryant\nVessel FuneralFlowers:partplay,\npart poetry, all authentic\nV\nessel traverses\na very fine line\nbetween \u201cwhat\nthe hell am I\nwatching?\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t\nstop watching\u201d. Eerie\nmusic and near humanly\nimpossible contortions\nof the human body make\nthis both the weirdest and\nmost captivating thing\nI\u2019ve ever witnessed on\nstage \u2013 I simply couldn\u2019t\ntake my eyes off it.\nThis collaboration\nbetween French-Belgian\nchoreographer Damien\nJalet and Japanese\nsculptor Kohei Nawais\nwas a truly unique work\nof art, visually striking\nwith masterful technique.\nI don\u2019t know anything\nabout dance, but I can\ntell you that some of the\npositions that the seven\ndancers got themselves\ninto seemed superhuman.\nAs they tangled with\none another, sometimes\nyou couldn\u2019t see where\none body started and the\nother ended. The physical\nendurance it must have\ntaken to maintain the\n\u2018headlessness\u2019 for a whole\nhour \u2013 that is, their arms\nalways concealing their\nentire heads \u2013 seemed like\nit must have been incredibly painful to do whilst\nsimultaneously intertwining and undulating their\nbodies. I was in absolute\nawe of their physical\ncontrol and skill. The lack\nof identity, along with the\nnakedness (save for a pair\nof flesh-coloured shorts),\ngave the impression of\nwhat counts as human and\nwhat doesn\u2019t.\nIt starts with the whole\nstage covered in water;\nour eyes trick us as we\nsee both the dancers and\ntheir reflections. By the\nend, foam is being used as\nthe main prop as the few\nremaining dancers cover\nthemselves in it. It sounds\nweird thinking about\nit now, but at the time\nit seemed like it made\nperfect sense considering\nwhat I had been watching\nfor the last 45 minutes.\nThe whole production\nwas like something set in\nouter space.\nTo be honest, I could\nsee why this wouldn\u2019t be\nfor everyone. It\u2019s a full\nhour of strange living art\nunfolding in front of your\nvery eyes, but visually\nit was so mesmerising,\nand in the moment it was\nso special to be there. I\nwasn\u2019t sure if I would\never see anything like it\nagain. In fact, I would\nnever have usually chosen\nto see something like this\nbut I\u2019m glad I did. With\nmy newfound wisdom,\nmy advice is: if you ever\nsee an advertisement for\na slightly strange production like this, take a\nchance and give it a go.\nF\nuneral Flowers,\nwritten and performed by Emma\nDennis Edwards,\nis about 17-year-old\nAngelique, aspiring\nflorist trying to withstand\nthe hardships in her life\nthat strike at her resolve\ntime and time again. With\na powerful protagonist\naccompanying an equally\npowerful script of lyrical\nverse and North London\nslang, Edwards deftly\nplays multiple characters\nto give us the full picture\nof what goes on in her\nworld. We see her for the\nmost part as herself, but\nalso playing her foster\nmum, floristry teacher,\nmother, and boyfriend \u2013 a\nfeat that requires real\ntalent and should be\napplauded.\nWe see a vulnerability\nto Angelique behind her\nconfident exterior, and\nhow experiencing sexual\nviolence at the hands of\nher boyfriend and his\ngang changes her as she\ntries to gather the strength\nto move past it. We see\nher thought processes as\nshe speaks to us, trying\nto justify things in her\nmind to convince herself\nshe\u2019s okay even though\nthe things that happen\nto her are not okay and\nneither is she \u2013 something\nthat many women can\nrelate to. The way she\nperforms this scene is\ningenious; she calls the\naudience to the middle\nof the room and we all sit\non the floor looking up at\nher as she performs this\nheart-wrenching mono-logue. From then on, the\nplay takes a darker turn\nas we see a blatant shift in\nher personality though she\ntries to conceal her pain.\nBy seeing everything\nfeels startlingly like a real\nperson \u2013 she could easily\nbe someone we know,\nor even ourselves. What\nmakes the play all the\nmore emotional is that as\nsad as the story is, it isnt\nactually unique at all, and\neveryone in the audience\nknows that. We\u2019ve heard\nor lived through countless\npermutations of the same\nstory. The open-ended\nfinish, where we don\u2019t\nknow whether Angelique\nreally does move past it\nor not, whether she fulfils\nher dreams or is doomed\nto a life like her mother\u2019s,\nmirrors the uncertainty\nwe all feel as we move\nthrough life very realisti-cally.\nThe stage was surrounded with flowers,\nmaking the room smell\nbeautiful despite the\nintense subject matters,\nand the immersive aspect\nof the performance that\nrequired us to follow her\naround the room at times,\nmade this play unique,\nand definitely one to\nremember.

Being aware\nof the sensitivity of these\nstories, I believed that\nby creating a channel\nfor students to share\ntheir supervision stories\nanonymously in Felix, we\ncould glance behind the\nscenes and understand the\nreality of supervision at\nthe College. By sharing\npositive as well as negative experiences with\nsupervision, I hoped that\nwe could create an institutional discussion around\nthe quality of supervision\nand the success of College\nprocedures in dealing\nwith failing relationships.\nOne major problem with\nsupervision is its huge\nvariety in quality, ranging from students at the\nCollege feeling very supported to those suffering\ndaily and turning into case\nnumbers and waiting lists\nat the College Counselling\nservice.\nOver the course of four\nmonths, I have hardly\nreceived any supervision\nstories, which shows that\nsomething about this\nequation just doesn\u2019t add\nup. Why do students talk\nabout, but do not want\nto share their stories? Is\nit that everyone is just\ntoo busy to sit down for\n20 minutes to write and\nshare? Is it that people\nthink their story is not\nworth sharing? Or are\nstudents afraid of being\nidentified, even as anonymous writers, threatening\nthe future of their relationship with their supervisors\nand the outcome of their\nPhD? Frankly, I have no\nclue, and probably, it is a\nmixed bag of reasons.\nHaving promised that I\nwould work on this topic,\nI use any opportunity to\nraise awareness about\nthe student-supervisor\nrelationship and its link\nto PG well-being (which\nwas proven in the 2017/18\nHEFCE well-being\nreport). My main concern\nis that students actually\ndo have many ways to\nimprove their supervision,\nbut they still seem to feel\npowerless and scared. Just\nto mention a few mecha-nisms: on the local level,\nstudents can speak to\ntheir PG Tutors as well as\nraise a complaint within\ntheir Departments. If this\nseems too immediate,\nstudents can speak to the\nPG Senior Tutor at their\nFaculty. Final instance\nis to raise a formal\ncomplaint, following the\nacademic complaints\nregulation (to find on the\nImperial College Website,\npathway: Home \u2013 About\n\u2013 Governance - Academic\ngovernance - Academic\npolicy - Complaints,\nappeals and discipline).\nComplaints can be\nhandled at three levels,\nfrom local to College,\nand there are several\nmethods of intervention\nand monitoring for difficult student-supervisor\nrelationships.\nI started wondering. Do\nstudents use the formal\ncomplaint\u2019s procedure?\nOr does either the lack of\nknowledge about these\nprocedures, or fear, keep\nstudents from using this\nprocess? Is the complaints\nprocedure fit-for-purpose\nto encourage PG students\nto reach out? To find out\nmore and discuss this\nquestion at the Postgraduate Research Quality\nCommittee, I filed a\nFreedom of Information\nRequest to the complaints\nteam of the College. I\nreceived the following\nresponse with data from\nthe last 5 years:\n\u2022 72% of all academic\ncomplaints were\nraised by PG\nstudents, which is\nreflected in 26 formal\ncomplaints.\n\u2022 Of those, 11 were\nrelated to supervisors\nwhile the others\nreferred to issues with\nthe programme man-agement, resource\nallocation, service\nprovision and others.\n\u2022 Typical outcomes\nof these complaints\nhave been the partial\nrefunding of fees,\ncompensation, or\nadditional time\ngranted to the student\nto complete their\nprogramme of study.\nPretty good, isn\u2019t it?\nBut wait\u2026 11 complaints\nin 5 years? The data\nprovided by the College\nonly referred to the Level\n3 complaints. But before\ncomplaints reach level\n3, many complaints get\nresolved at levels 1 and 2.\nUnfortunately, the complaints team was unable to\nhand out information on\nthe numbers of complaints\nfor levels 1 and 2, using\nthe disclosure exemption\nrule under section 12 (1)\nof the Freedom of Information Act. Apparently,\nit would take them more\nthan 18 hours to put that\ndata together, as they\nclaimed they would have\nto email all teaching staff\nat the College and ask\nthem which complaints\nhad been filed against\nthem. After reading the\ncomplaints regulation, I\nreckoned, this can hardly\nbe true. Responses to\nLevel 1 complaints must\nbe recorded through\nthe email student.com-plaints@imperial.ac.uk.\nLevel 2 complaints must\nbe submitted via a formal\nStudent Complaint Submission Form. I raised\nthese reservations with\nthe College and requested\nanother round of informa-tion. The outcome is that\nfor years, the College has\nnot collected any centralised information on Level\n1 and 2 complaints. Only\nin 2018, the complaints\nprocedure was changed\nso that now, departments\nhave to inform the complaints team about what\nis happening under their\nadministration.\nWhile it is utterly sad\nthat a university of \u2018excellence\u2019, which Imperial\nCollege claims to be, has\nrefrained from monitoring\ntheir complaints for so\nmany years, it is also a\nsign of progress. Since\nI started my presidency,\nI sense a certain wind of\nchange blowing around\nthe College corridors.\nThere is a growing\nunderstanding that the\nexperience of PG students\nneeds to be taken serious-ly, and that the College\nmust maintain an eye on\nthe work of supervisors.\nI hope that future GSU\npresidents will uphold the\npressure on the College\nso that supervisors with\nrepetitive complaints can\nbe stopped from taking\non more students. What\ndoes this mean for PG\nstudents? It is important\nthat you make yourself\nvisible if you are suffering\nbecause only through\ntaking advantage of the\nmechanisms in place,\ncan we change the way\nin which the College is\nrun. You are not alone, so\ndon\u2019t be afraid to claim\nyour rights.\nI\noften find myself\nfaced with questions\nfrom friends and\ncolleagues such as\n\u201cWhat is it like to be a gay\nman at uni?\u201d or \u201cHow do\nothers perceive you once\nthey find out that you are\ngay?\u201d. I used to ask the\nsame questions during\nmy undergraduate studies\nat UCL, prior to starting\nmy MRes+PhD course in\nChemical Biology in the\nDepartment of Chemistry\nhere at Imperial. I wondered whether I would\nbe accepted by my future\ncolleagues in research and\nby my supervisors. I was\nconstantly thinking about\nthe potentially negative\nimpact revealing my sexuality could have on my\nresearch and future career\nprospects. I anxiously\nasked myself \u201cIs it worth\nkeeping your sexuality\na secret?\u201d. Having been\nhere for a year and half\nnow, I am glad to say that\nthe answer to this question\nis a resounding \u201cNO!\u201d.\nAfter coming to\nImperial, I was elated\nto find that the LGBT+\ncommunity is well represented all around college.\nSupport groups such as\nIQ and Imperial 600 do\na great deal of work by\norganising seminars,\ncampaigns and events\nto raise the visibility of\nthe LGBT+ community\naround college and\ncreate a more welcoming\nenvironment. One of the\ncampaigns organised by\nImperial 600 that I absolutely love is the distribution of Imperial College\nLondon branded rainbow\nlanyards to their members,\nwhich is a fantastic way\nA Rainbow Chemist at Imperial\nA Black girl in STEM\nPOSTGRADUATE\nAnonymous\nPhD Student\nW\nhere I\u2019m\nfrom, the\ncolour of\nmy skin\ndidn\u2019t make me \u201cthe\nminority\u201d, nor did being a\nfemale determine my academic success. Where I\u2019m\nfrom, it was quite commonly joked about that\nthe girls were smarter and\nmore mature than the boys\nbecause, after all, \u201cbehind\nevery successful man is a\nstrong woman who helped\nhim get there\u201d. So, from\nan early age, I never once\nthought that my gender\nwould determine my\nprogression.\nThat quickly changed\non arrival to University.As\nexcited and starry-eyed as\nI was, I didn\u2019t quite know\nwhat I expected but, to be\nthe ONLY black person\nin all of my programmes\nat the University was not\nwhat I had in mind. What\na way to stand out\u2026as if\nbeing one of five females\nin an engineering Master\u2019s\nwasn\u2019t enough, the colour\nof my skin made me stand\nout even more, and simultaneously put a target\non my back. As black\nwomen, we are easily\nidentified when we make\nmistakes but seldom recognised for achievements.\nWe are boxed in by stereotypes which narrate that\nwearing specific garments\nor accessories were\ndeemed as distracting\nrather than fashionable.\nSo, to avoid drawing even\nmore attention to myself,\nI tried to dim down that\nAGSUPresidenttearingherhairoutoveranambitiousprojectandhowshefiledaFreedomofInformationrequest\nto the College\nDimming down my blackness\nstereotypical \u201cblack girl\u201d\nimage in hopes that the\nhoops or head wraps\nwouldn\u2019t distract from my\nintelligence. I guess I did\npretty well as I have even\nbeen told \u201cyou\u2019re quite\nsoft spoken for a black\ngirl\u201d.\nAt a point in my pro-gramme, I was amazed\nby how much my female\nclassmate admired and\nlooked up to our female\nlecturer. However, there\nwas no one I could relate\nto as all my lecturers were\nmostly male and I didn\u2019t\nexpect the only female\nlecturer to understand\nwhat it was like to be a\nblack woman in STEM.\nThe feeling of isolation\nand being misunderstood\nthrough the lack of representation was, and continues to be, a struggle. As\na black girl in STEM, it\nbecame clear that we often\nhave to forge our own\npaths and strive to be that\nexample and mentor for\nfuture generations. I later\nrealised, it was not the\nfailures that were going to\ndefine me or us minority\nfemales but, rather, the resilience in getting back up\nand fighting through these\nchallenges that makes\nme and other women of\ncolour stronger.\nBut you see, the\nchallenge never ends,\nnever really ends. With\nthe rise of diversity and\ninclusivity, we now check\nthe boxes of many organ-isations:\nBlack; Female\u2026but\nthis only gets me in the\ndoor. I have to work even\nharder to show my ability\nas there is a probability\nthat I was just selected to\nhelp boost their diversity\nscore. Sadly, this reality\nis often expressed by\nbitter male colleagues\nwho think they deserved\nyour spot. But please\ndon\u2019t let my shyness or\n\u201cquiet black-girl\u201d nature\nfool you because, through\nmy heritage, I have been\nraised strong and resilient.\nI know my worth and my\nlack of entitlement has\ntaught me how to be a part\nof a community and blend\nacross gender, race, sexuality to get the job done.\nSo, although we\nstruggle to be represented,\nI\u2019ll say thank you because\nit only makes us stronger.\nWe work harder, we work\nsmarter and are more\ncommitted than ever. So,\nnow I wear my hoops\nand headscarves with\npride because IT\u2019S TIME\nTHAT WE STAND OUT\nAND BE RECOGNISED\nFOR THE WORK THAT\nIS TRULY OURS AND\nGIVE YOUNG GIRLS\nSOMEONE TO LOOK\nUP TO WITH PRIDE.\nPOSTGRADUATE\nSimeon Draganov\nResearch Postgraduate\nto raise the visibility of\nthe LGBT+ community\nat Imperial and you get a\nstrange sense of comfort\nwhen you see one of the\ncolourful lanyards coming\ntowards you! Imperial also\nobserves LGBT history\nmonth which provides a\ngreat opportunity to find\nout more about LGBT+\nhistory and the LGBT+\ncommunity outside of\ncollege.\nI am often asked about\nhow my supervisors\nperceive me after finding\noutaboutmysexuality,and\nif their attitude changed\nafter learning about it.\nWhile this is something\nI have not explicitly\ndiscussed with them, it\nhas been rather like an\nopen secret all along, and\nI never felt in any way\ndiscriminated against by\nthem or members of my\nresearch groups. I have\nalways felt that as long\nas your science is good,\npeople will judge you on\nthe merits of your work\nand not because of your\nsexuality, and I find that\nthis is very much the case\nhere at Imperial.\nAs for future career\nprospects, it has been very\nreassuring to see so many\nopenly LGBT+ members\nof staff turning up to the\nImperial 600 meetings.\nIn academia at least, my\nview is that being gay\ndoes not play a role in\ndetermining whether you\nare successful or not, it is\nall about one\u2019s own ideas,\npersonality and deter-mination. Tom Welton\u2019s\ntruly inspiring ascent, the\nfirst openly gay academic\nto hold the position \u2018Dean\nof the Faculty of Natural\nSciences\u2019 at Imperial, is\nthe ultimate proof. During\nmy MRes year, I had\nthe opportunity to visit\nseveral chemical/phar-maceutical companies in\nindustry. I was pleasantly\nsurprised to see many of\nthem discussing the steps\nthey were taking against\ndiscrimination of LGBT+\npeople in the workplace\nand what they were doing\nto promote inclusivity and\nacceptance among their\nemployees.\nI feel very lucky to\nbe where I am, and I am\nhighly appreciative of\nthe support that I have\nreceived from many\npeople around Imperial,\nboth staff and students,\npostgraduates and under-graduates. For many of\nus in the LGBT+ com-munity, finding yourself\nand accepting yourself for\nthe person you really are\ncan be a long and scary\njourney, and I am glad\nthat Imperial, through its\npolicies, societies and\nvolunteer-led networks is\nreaching out to LGBT+\npeople more than ever\nbefore.\nThis is just one perspective of a postgraduate gay man from the\nDepartment of Chemistry\nand perhaps isn\u2019t representative of everyone in\nthe LGBT+ community\nhere at Imperial \u2013 LGBT\npeople are truly as diverse\nas the colour spectrum of\nthe rainbow and while my\nexperiences as a gay man\nhave been overwhelmingly positive, others\nmay have a completely\ndifferent story to tell. I\nhope that more and more\nstudents representing different parts of the LGBT+\ncommunity are willing\nto share their stories as\nthis allows us to gauge\nwhether we are moving\nin the right direction and\ninforms us what we can\ndo to change things for the\nbetter, for everyone!\nYou get a strange sense of\ncomfort when you see one\nof the colourful lanyards //\nSimeon Draganov\n\n"

I was certainly\nnot alone in my excitement and the audience\u2019s\ncollective enthusiasm\nwas palpable as we hung\non to her every word,\nlistening to Michelle\nreflect on her life as\ndecribed in Becoming.\nIn the wide-ranging\ninterview, chaired by\nUS late-night television\nhost, Stephen Colbert,\nwho did a good job of\ninjecting humour and\nbringing necessary\nlevity to proceedings,\nMichelle delved into all\naspects of her life. Much\nlike in the memoir, we\nare taken on a journey,\nfrom Michelle Robinson\n- the girl from a work-ing-class family growing\nup on the south side of\nChicago - to Michelle\nObama - mother, philanthropist and First Lady,\nand all the trials and\ntribulations faced on the\nway.\nFor the memoir of\na former White House\nresident, Becoming is\nsurprisingly apolitical.\nMichelle Obama\u2019s\naversion to politics is\napparent throughout the\nbook - it\u2019s not something\nshe enjoys, more something that was thrust\nupon her. Although the\nconversation rarely\nstrayed into political\nterritory, when asked for\nher views on the current\nUS political climate,\nMichelle said: \u201cIt\u2019s time\nfor us to roll up our\nsleeves and, if we are not\nhappy with the state of\nthings then, in democra-cies, we have votes. We\nhave to be engaged and\nwe can\u2019t take our rights\nand liberties for granted\nbecause, if we don\u2019t\nvote, somebody else\nwill.\u201d This was a rather\nsimplistic view that\ndoesn\u2019t tackle a host of\npolitical issues, includ-ing, for instance, when\nvoters don\u2019t feel represented by the policies\nof the options at hand.\nHowever, Becoming,\nand this event, are about\nmuch more than politics.\nI urge readers to put their\npolitical views on the\nObama administration\naside as there is something to be learned and\ninspiration to be gleaned\nfrom Michelle Obama\u2019s\nstory of motherhood and\nfamily.\nBecoming is divided\ninto sections, my\nfavourite of which is\n\u201cBecoming Us\u201d, where\nMichelle dives into her\nrelationship with Barack\nObama - them meeting,\neventually falling in\nlove and how their relationship has evolved.\nThe way she speaks so\nglowingly about Barack\nand the peace he brings\nher is wonderful and you\ncan\u2019t help but admire\nhow pure their love is.\nBlack love at its finest\n- it\u2019s a beautiful thing!\nJ. Cole should change\nthe lyrics to his 2014\nhit \u2018No Role Modelz\u2019\nfrom, \u201cI want a real\nlove... that Jada and that\nWill love\u201d to \u201cI want a\nreal love... that Barack\nand Michelle love\u201d. All\nThe woman of the hour // Andy Djaba\nBOOKS\nAndy Djaba\nEditor-in-Chief\njokes aside, it is refreshing to see the human\naspect of a couple that\nhas dominated political\nconversation for the last\ndecade.\nI also particularly\nenjoyed the sections\nin which she described\ncoping with the loss of\nher father and I would\nrecommend those\nchapters for anybody\nstruggling with bereave-ment. It\u2019s comforting to\nknow that. somewhere\nout there, somebody\nelse is going through\nsomething similar and\nfeeling what you\u2019re\nfeeling. Obama addressed the crowd\u2019s\nreception, saying: \u201cI\nthink it\u2019s a testament to\nhow much we all have\nin common around the\nworld. The fact that\npeople are finding themselves in the story of\nthis little girl, Michelle\nRobinson, on the south\nside of Chicago is not a\ntestament to me and my\nstory, but it\u2019s a reminder\nthat we\u2019re OK, folks.\nWe\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\nWith this, Michelle\nperfectly captured the\nbeauty of Becoming. I\ninitially had my reservations about reading\na memoir because I\nwasn\u2019t convinced anybody\u2019s life is honestly\ninteresting enough for\nme to devote time to\nreading about. The only\n(auto-)biography I\u2019ve\never enjoyed is Sir Alex\nFerguson\u2019s (I\u2019m yet to\nread Malcom X\u2019s but it\u2019s\nnext on my reading list)\nand that\u2019s definitely got\nsomething to do with my\nManchester United-bias.\nHowever, Becoming\nproved me wrong with\nits honesty and moments\nof vulnerability which\nare relatable for all\nreaders.\nEditor-in-Chief, Andy Djaba, makes his Books Section debut to review a special evening full of gems with the\nformer First Lady\nThis girl is on fire // Andy Djaba Djangba clan // Andy Djaba\n\n"

This time\nwe ventured outside of\nLondon to the Bedford\nAutodrome; a racing\ncircuit for cars built on an\nold airfield. The Bedford\nAutodrome duathlon\nis a unique one in the\nTriathlon race calendar,\nas it is the only national\ncompetition that we take\npart of outside of the\nuniversity system. Forget\nBUCS medals, placing\ntop 3 in your age-group\nor finishing within 110%\nof the winning time in\nthis duathlon qualifies\nyou automatically for the\nGB Duathlon team and\nsecures you an entry at\nthe European Duathlon\nChampionships in 2020,\nin other words, racing well\nmakes you a bigwig. With\na massive 400 entries, this\nrace was a big one.\nThere were two race\ndistances on offer: a\n\u2018sprint\u2019 and \u2018standard\u2019\nduathlon. The sprint\nduathlon was a 5km run,\n20km bike which was\nfollowed by another run\n\u2013 mercifully only 2.5km.\nI think it says something\nabout the sport when the\nsprint event takes over\nan hour to complete. The\nstandard distance is the\nsame format but double\nthe distance in every leg.\nArriving at the Autodrome we discovered that\nthere was wind. Lots of\nwind, 40kph worth, to be\nexact. This made the bike\nsection more \u2018character\nbuilding\u2019 than was initially anticipated.\nHenry \u201cI hate cycling\u201d\nHart knew that the\nrunning leg would be his\nstrongest, so made sure\nto go out strong and hope\nthat he could hold on for\nthe cycle. With a blistering fast off the bike run\nhe finished in 10th place\noverall, and 3rd in his age\ncategory. Matt Ryan, as\nwell as showing that he\ncould count laps this time,\nalso had the fastest transition time of the whole\ncompetition in an incredible 26 seconds. Matt\nfinished 12th overall and\n4th in his age category.\nCedric Ormond flew by\non his new bike to finish\n3rd in his age category.\nAlex Mundell was 3rd\nfastest in the first running\nleg. Amy Davila was not\nfar behind with the 4th\nfastest overall running\nleg for both runs (before\nand after the cycle). Big\nrespect is to be had for\nJacob Kay and Mari\nFunabashi, who finished\ndespite not being at full\nfitness.\nIncredible success was\nenjoyed by all, with many\ntop 3 age group finishes\nand lots of potential qualifying times. We will have\nto wait until after Summer\nonce all the qualification\nraces are out of the way\nto see who qualified for\nteam GB.

At the pub\nin Stansted Airport, the\ntheme of the trip was set:\nsome running, a sprinkle\nof sight-seeing, high class\nmeals in top restaurants\nand of course, enjoying\nlocal beverages!\nAfter a two-hour flight,\nthe team arrived at its\nfive-star accommodation.\nICXC was kindly hosted\nby the Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Poznaniu\n(Pozna\u0144\u2019s equivalent to\nLSE) in their student\nhouses for three nights.\nIt was an honour to be\ninvited by the former\nPolish Olympic Athlete,\nRafal Wieruszewski,\nto take part in the 9th\nedition of the Economic\nFive Race organised by\nthe University of Pozna\u0144.\nUpon arrival, bags were\nquickly unpacked, and it\nwas time to explore!\nAll the Pozna\u0144 rumours\nare proven right: it is\na young and dynamic\ncity with a subtle mix of\nRenaissance buildings,\nArt Deco streets, and\nCommunist-era austere\ninfrastructure. Amazed\nby the main square, Stary\nRynek, and its town hall,\nthe team practiced their\npronunciation of \u2018Ile\nkosztuje piwo?\u2019 (\u2018piwo\u2019\nmeans \u2018beer\u2019), whilst\nenjoying the spring sun\nfor the rest of the after-noon. Their first dinner\nwas was a traste of rich\nand appetizing traditional\nCentral European food, all\nfor the price of a sandwich\nfrom the JCR! It was then\ntime to hit the Polish pubs\non an eventful night-out.\nThe next morning. for\nthe early birds amongst\nthem, the Citadel Park\nprovided a perfect spot\nfor a short jog and a yoga\nsession in the grass. The\nawakened team then\nwent to the city centre\nfor breakfast, composed\nof famous \u2018Rogale Swietomarcinskie\u2019, or Saint\nMartin croissant. The\ncultural experience moved\nfrom their mouths to their\nears as they attended a traditional dance and music\nperformance. Their exploration continued on the\nCathedral Island, which\nsaw the formation of the\nPolish state. Next stop was\nthe hipster neighbourhood\nof Srodka, on the other\nside of the Warna River.\nAnother hearty dinner\naround a massive wood\ntable welded the team\ntogether before going to\nbed for a nice long rest.\nSunday was race day\nand everyone loaded\nup with carbs from a\nhomecooked porridge.\nThe team arrived at Lake\nMatla, along which the\n5 km race was to take\nplace. They received their\nracing packs containing\na towel and a beer. At 12\nsharp, they and 800 other\nrunners from all around\nPoland began a flat and\nfast 5 km lap around the\nlake. One mile before\nthe finish line, they were\nall very pleased to see\ntheir own photographer\nWilly Bonneuil, who was\nunfortunately injured and\nnot in the race, cheering\nthem on.\nMatt Ryan led the\nteam with an amazing\npace, completing the race\nin 17:47 and securing a\nstrong first place for an\nInternational competitor.\nFresher Lea Adamson\nbrought back a 1st\nplace for Imperial in the\nInternational Womens,\nfollowed by Kay Raftery.\nICXCAC\u2019s ladies all ran\ngreat times with Marie\nJones, Maryna Voloshyna,\nand Lisa Hey all scoring\npersonal bests.\nThe biggest moment of\nglorycamewhenICXCAC\nwas announced, with a\nstrong Polish accent, to\nbe the second-best team\nof the race. Matt Ryan,\nJim Warren, Aymeric\nRegnier, Mihai Vanea,\nThomas Deronzier and\nLawrence Tse climbed on\nthe podium to raise high\ntheir silver trophy! After\nan extensive photoshoot,\nthe team headed to a quiet\nrestaurant for a traditional\npost-race meal.\nTheir last evening in\nPoland was devoted to\nthe celebration of their\nmorning successes.\nFollowing a final king-like dinner together,\nthe team took over the\n\u2018beer and vodka\u2019 bar for\nan unexpected karaoke\nnight. Once given the\nmicrophone, top hits from\nsocials back in London\nwere sung, giving Pozna\u0144\na taste of a night-out iat\nThe Slug! They chanted,\nuntil the early hours of the\nmorning, songs in both\nEnglish and Polish to the\ndelight of all the pub.\nTrophies survived the\nnight-out and were safely\npacked to bring home.\nAt the end of the long\nweekend, some members\nhad to fly back the next\nmorning, with revision\nwaiting for them back in\ngrey London.

However, there\u2019s\na new orchestra which has\nbeen growing in the past\nfew months: Kohncertino.\nLed by first-year maths\nstudent Michael Kohn,\nKohncertino held its\ndebut concert on Saturday\n16th\nMarch, at St Gabriel\u2019s\nChurch, Warwick Square\nin Pimlico.\nTo begin the concert - a\nmusical journey around\nEurope (before we leave)\n- Kohncertino performed\nthe \u2018Hebrides\u2019 Overture\u2019\nby Felix Mendelssohn.\nCommencing Mendelssohn\u2019sworkaboutFingal\u2019s\nCave with a polyphonic,\nwholesome contribution\nfrom the violas, cellos\nand bassoons, a refined\nsense of the bucolic and\nwondrous nature of the\nsetting by which this work\nwas inspired was instantly\ncreated. Conversely, the\nentire orchestra came into\nplay to create an equally\npotent sense of the choppy\nwaters and formidable\nnature of the seas surrounding the Hebrides;\nthe dynamic transition\nfrom peaceful melody to\nfortissimo, forceful waves\nwas particularly well\nexecuted.\nFollowing this,\ntime for violin soloist\nSilke Nodwell to take\ncentre-stage, as the\norchestra diminished in\nsize for Mozart\u2019s \u2018Violin\nConcerto No. 5 (The\nTurkish)\u2019. Once again the\norchestra\u2019s performance,\nthis time with Silke on\nthe violin, resonated with\nclear passion and deep\nunderstanding of each\nof the three movements.\nThen were the moments\nwhen Silke played solo.\nEngaged with the music\nand clearly very inde-pendent, Silke not only\nensured that justice was\ndone to the vast array of\nmoods and feelings that\nthis concerto encompass-es, but also that a personal\ntouch of true passion was\ninjected into the perfor-mance.\nDrawing the evening\n(as well as the musical\njourney around Europe)\nto a conclusion was Mendelssohn\u2019s \u2018Symphony\nNo. 4\u2019 (Italian). Starting\nwith vigour and gusto,\nKohncertino fully\ncaptured the joyful,\nlively mood of the first\nmovement.Then,themore\nsombre air of the second\nand third movements was\nreplicated to considerable\neffect. Finally, to conclude\nthe entire evening, the\nfinal movement (presto)\nwas performed. For the\nlast time, Michael and the\nentire orchestra invested\ntheir fullest gusto and\nenergy into depicting a\nsense of overwhelming\nexcitement. The final\nflourish: the crescendo to\nthe end. One final burst\nof energy testament to the\nevening\u2019s success.\nBehind the orchestra\u2019s\nformidable work is the\nconductor and director\nhimself, Michael Kohn.\nBeing his debut as a con-ductor; as with anyone\u2019s\ndebut in anything, one\ncould forgive Michael\nfor feelings of nervous-ness. However, from the\nmoment of entry, Michael\nexuded a full aura of confidence and control. This\nfollowed through into\nthe concert; any member\nof the audience could\nsense Michael\u2019s clear\ncommand over the music.\nUnfailingly attentive and\ngenuinely engaged with\nthe music, one could\nsee Michael constantly\nattending to the orchestra,\nbe it the entire group or\njust a single section; and\nwho could miss the true,\ninfectious passion he had\nfor the music of the night,\nwhich passed onto the\norchestra?\nHaving seen Kohncertino\u2019s first concert,\nKohncertino seems to be\na young yet vibrant force\nin the London classical\nmusic scene. Before\nlong, Kohncertino has the\npotential to be something\nmuch bigger. And certainly worth going to the next\nconcert.\nMUSIC\nTimothy Kang\nMusic Writer\n\n"

With a moderately\nhigh turnout (75.8%) and\na record number of ballots\n(more than 26 million),\nthe election also saw the\nfar-right Vox enter the\nchamber for the first time,\nthough with fewer seats\nthan what the polls had\nforeseen.\nPSOE won 123 seats\nand 28.7% of the vote,\nan increase from the 85\nseats and 22.6% they had\nthe last time the country\nwent to the polls in 2016.\nThey also were able to\nbe victorious in 40 of the\n51 provinces of Spain,\ntopping the poll in areas\nwhere a left-wing party\nhad not won since the\n80s. The party got into\ngovernment in May 2018\nafter S\u00e1nchez successfully\ntoppled the right-wing\nPeople\u2019s Party (PP) Prime\nMinister Mariano Rajoy\nvia a motion of censure\nagainst the government,\nafter a law court found\nPP as an organisation to\nbe guilty of several corruption charges. S\u00e1nchez\ncan now choose between\nrenewing the supply and\nconfidence agreement he\nhad with the left-wing\nTogether We Can (UP)\nand the Basque and\nCatalan nationalists or\nseeking the support of the\nresurgent Citizens (Cs), a\nliberal party that was the\nother winner of the night.\nPP, led by the young\na \u2018traitor\u2019 that had sold\nthe country to Catalan\nnationalists. While he\nhas announced that he\nwill not resign before\nthe next poll day (local\nand European elections\nwill be held in less than a\nmonth), Casado\u2019s position\nas leader of the opposition\nwas severely threatened\nby Cs\u2019Albert Rivera, who\nfinished less than a percentage point behind him.\nIndeed, Rivera saw his\nparty becoming the third\nlargest in the country,\ngaining a further 25 seats\nto reach a grand total\nof 57. His strategy of\nadopting PP\u2019s abandoned\ncentre-right ideological\nposition proved to be quite\npopular, though it could\narguably be said that his\nanti-Catalan and Basque\nnationalist zeal was even\nstronger than that of\nPP. Rivera now intends\nto become the de facto\nleader of the opposition as\nPP\u2019s crisis worsens.\nWhile not as dramatic\nas PP\u2019s, Pablo Iglesias\u2019s\nUP also had a bad night\nat the polls. They lost 29\nseats to 42, got 14.3% of\nthe vote and fell from their\npast position as the third\nlargest party to the one\nbelow that. The party lost\na considerable amount\nof its voters to S\u00e1nchez,\nwho successfully adopted\nthe strategy of presenting\nitself as the only party\nthat could successfully\nstop the far right from\ngetting into power. UP\nwas also damaged by\nthe continuous internal\nwar between its factions\nthat saw several of their\nmost high-profile MPs\nout of the leader\u2019s team.\nHowever, the fall in vote\npercentage and seats was\nless that what the polls\npredicted, and they will\nprobably still have considerable influence over\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s government,\nas its support is needed\nto achieve a majority of\nvotes in parliament.\nVox entered the\nchamber for the first time\nwith 24 seats and 10.3%\nof the vote. The far right\nparty that was created\nby former PP members\nthat split from the main\norganisation used the\ncampaign to demonise\nethnic and sexual minorities and adopted a\nstrong anti-feminist,\nanti-Basque, anti-Catalan\ndiscourse, influenced by\nthe Catholic Church and\nby the ideology of the\nfascist Franco regime that\nruled the country with an\niron grip for 40 years. Its\nresults are less impressive\nthat what the opinion\npolls were showing the\ndays before the election,\nwhich are probably a consequence of the several\nscandals they were embroiled with, with several\nmembers in exit positions\nin the party lists revealed\nas Holocaust deniers and\nwife beaters. In fact, the\nbiggest effect that Vox\nhad was increasing the\nturnout of the left-wing\nsupporting electorates,\nwho flocked to the polls\nto stop the extremist party\nfrom giving PP and Cs\nthe numbers to form a\ngovernment coalition.\nBasque and Catalan\nnationalists also achieved\na great result, winning\nthe election in the Basque\nCountry and Catalonia.\nHowever, the more\nmoderate parties within\nthecurrent(PNVandERC,\nrespectively) managed to\ncome above their more\nradical counterparts (EH\nBildu and JxCat, the party\nof former Catalan PM\nPuigdemont, who is currently in Belgium outside\nthe reach of the Spanish\ncourts after the failed\nindependence referendum\nin 2017). ERC, which also\nparticipated in the referendum and saw its leadership jailed, has shown\nwillingness to moderate\nits positions and reach an\nagreement with S\u00e1nchez\nfor parliamentary support\nin return for further\nautonomy for Catalonia.\nIts former leader Oriol\nJunqueras, (who is currently detained and under\ntrial for the independence\ndeclaration) was elected\nto parliament, through it\nis not clear if the courts\nwill grant him permission\nto take his seat.\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE in Spanish) won\na commanding victory in the general election hel last Sunday in Spain // Bloomberg\n\u201cThe election\nalso saw the\nfar-right Vox\nenter the\nchamber for\nthe first time,\nthough with\nfewer seats\nthan what\nthe polls had\nforeseen\u201d\nand fiery Pablo Casado,\nsuffered its heaviest defeat\nin history. The party\nmanaged to get 66 MPs,\nless than half of that of\nof the last election, went\nbelow 20% of the vote\n(16.7%) for the first time\nsince the early 80s, and\nonly barely won in their\nrural strongholds of Lugo,\nOurense, Zamora and\nSalamanca. The party\u2019s\npolicies and rhetoric had\nmoved well to the right\nto face off the challenge\nof the upcoming Vox, the\ncampaign being marked\nby Casado\u2019s incendiary\nbranding of the PM as\n\u201cThe far right\nparty used\nthe campaign\nto demonise\nethnic and\nsexual\nminorities\nand adopted\na strong anti-feminist,\nanti-Basque,\nanti-Catalan\ndiscourse\u201d\n\n"

That is to say,\nthey learnt the moves in\nisolation from the music;\nCunningham believed\ndance is an artform which\ndoes not need to follow\nan individual beat. This\ncreated an excited tension\nin the audience, as we\nknew the dancers would\nfirst hear the live music at\nthe same time as we did,\nenabling some spontaneous creative interpretation\nfrom them.\nThe music was coordinated by Christian\nWolff and directed by\nJohn King. The five\nmusicians presented a\nmodern soundscape, with\ndiscordant and jarring\nnoises peppered with the\noccasional silence. The\nbeauty of Cunningham\u2019s\nstyle is that the rhythmic\nmovement of the dancers,\nthe slamming of feet and\nlanding of jumps, also\nbecomes a part of the\nmusical underscore.\nwere intricate, at times\ntrue solos and in other\nmoments interwoven\nwith others. These were\ntaken from 54 original\nCunningham choreogra-phies from 1953-2009.\nThe fantastic staging led\nby Daniel Squire gave a\nfresh take on these pieces.\nAs the iconic colourful\nLycra bodysuits flashed\nagainst the dark stage, it\nwas wonderful to see the\nsolos performed by such\na wide range of ages and\nbody types.\nOne of the highlights of\nthe night was seeing Billy\nTrevitt dancing in a body\nharness with tin cans,\ncreating music through his\nmovement. Or perhaps,\nin an earlier solo, with\nTrevitt demonstrating\nprecise deep lunges, and\nholding firm one of these\nlunges as he was lifted\nacross the stage. Siobhan\nDavies was another\nshow-stealer with her\nprecise, measured movements across the stage.\nOther artists stood out as\nwell. Francesca Hayward\nfrequently caught your\neye with the way she\ncarried feeling through\nher movements, elongating her deep pli\u00e9 with\nmeaning.

Cunningham\u2019s work is so uniquely\nphysical, it truly shows\noff dancers as the athletes\nthey are.\nWhile the solos were\nsqueezed into a long\n90 minutes without an\ninterval, had it been 10\nminutes shorter it would\nhave left the audience\nwanting more. There\nwas a notable amount\nof restless stirring in\nthe seats for these last\nminutes. Understandable,\nas the harsh nature of\nCunningham\u2019s technique\ndoes not make easy\nwatching.

The name comes\nfrom the feminist movement \u201cNevertheless, she\npersisted\u201d in 2017 after\nthe silencing of Senator\nElizabeth Warren in the\nUS Senate. The reference\nto women\u2019s persistence in\nbreaking barriers, despite\nthe hardships thrown at\nthem, is especially significant here.\nIn Annabelle Lopez\nOchoa\u2019s Broken Wings,\na revival from She Said,\nKatja Khaniukova is a\nspirited Frida Kahlo, a\nrole originally created on\nTamara Rojo, with Irek\nMukhamedov reprising as\nher womanising husband,\nDiego Rivera. The re-al-life comparisons of his\nelephant to her dove are\napparent, as is the subtext\nof the Day-of-the-Deadesque skeletons haunting\nFrida\u2019s every move. The\nmemorable monologue on\npain from BBC\u2019s Fleabag\ncomes to mind: \u201cWomen\nare born with pain built\nin\u2026 We carry it within\nourselves throughout our\nlives. Men don\u2019t.

The\neight-person piece set\nto Philip Glass\u2019 Tirol\nConcerto for Piano and\nOrchestra was scaled\nback, focusing on the\nrelationship of Nora and\nTorvald (beautifully performed by Crystal Costa\nand Jeffrey Cirio), with\nthe blackmailer Krogstad\nand five \u201cvoices\u201d clad in\ngrey silk acting as Nora\u2019s\nconscience, personifying\nher internal struggle and\nher growing self-worth\nand resolve. The series of\nduets go from light and\nwhimsical to increasingly\ncontrolling and dominat-ing, even resorting to a\nrepeating sit-on-my-knee\ndo-as-I-do motif. Jeffrey\nCirio delights in some\nof Quagebeur\u2019s best\nchoreography, complete\nwith outstanding leaps\nand changes of pace from\ndevastation and anger to\nsoftly manipulative. In the\nfinal desperately beautiful\npas de deux between the\ntwo, where she decides\nto leave him, you can\nalmost hear her narration:\n\u201cI have another duty, just\nas sacred. My duty to\nmyself\u201d.\nPina Bausch\u2019s 1975\nRite of Spring does not\nstart when the dancers\ncome onto the stage,\nrather in the laying of the\ndirt that the dancers will\nsoon throw themselves\ninto. Bausch passed away\nin 2009 but left a huge\nlegacy in one of the most\nriveting and visceral interpretations of a master-piece. Stravinsky\u2019s iconic\nscore and the otherness\nof both groups, all so\nyoung and so unlike the\nancient casts in other in-terpretations. The ethereal\nquality of the women in\ntheir long flowing gowns\nand the raw masculinity\nin the bare-chested men\nonly adds to the strangely\nhypnotic atmosphere,\nas if we along with the\ndancers are possessed\nby some overwhelming\ndestructive force. Pausch\nalways wanted to capture\nthe mind, body and soul of\nher dancers and in Francesca Velicu, who reprises\nher Olivier-winning role\nas the Chosen One, she\ncertainly has. In the final\nshattering solo, she loses\nherself in battling against\nher fate and so do we,\nhaunted by the unforgiving strings, her wild eyes\nand the terribly beautiful\ninevitability of it all.\nD\non McCullin is\nbest known as a\n\u2018war photographer\u2019, a title\nthat does not sit easy with\nhim. To him, photography\nis about empathy, but\nhe has never felt that the\nimpact of his pictures\nhave done enough to end\nthe suffering of the people\nhe depicts. \u2018If you can\u2019t\nfeel what you\u2019re looking\nat,\u2019 he said, \u2018then you\u2019re\nnever going to get others\nto feel anything when they\nlook at your pictures.\u2019\nIn the largest retrospective exhibition of\nhis works to date, this\nempathy McCullin speaks\nof penetrates each and\nevery one of his photo-graphs. Unusually for\nan exhibition of contemporary photography, he\nhas printed every work\nhimself. Although his\nrepeated return to these\npictures of suffering has\ntaken its toll, perhaps\nprinting his pictures\npersonally completes the\nprocess of embodying\nempathy for his subjects.\nBeginning with pictures\nof his community around\nFinsbury Park in London,\nwhere he grew up, this exhibition at the Tate Britain\ntraces McCullin\u2019s career\nacross various assignments in different parts of\nthe world in turmoil, interspersed with stints back\nhome. What ties these\nphotographs together is\nMcCullin\u2019s eye for human\nemotion, and a sensitivity\ntowards the people living\non the outskirts of society.\nEven from his early\nworks photographing\ngangs in north London,\nhis photographs were\nintuitive, full of curiosity and empathy for his\nsubjects. These photographs were picked up by\nthe press, earning him his\nfirst contract. From there,\nhe travelled to Berlin to\ndocument the building\nof the Berlin wall. In\nimages of East Germans\nlooking into West Berlin,\nhe captures the curiosity,\ntrepidation and uncertainty of the faces of the\nEast Germans emerging\nfrom behind the half-built\nwall; in West Berliners\nlooking East, women clad\nin thick coats look with\nconcern into the distance,\nand a child looks through\nbinoculars. These are the\nfaces of people witnessing\nhistory, uncertain about\nthe impact this wall will\nbring to their lives.\nThe impact of his\nphotographs are perhaps\nbest remembered by\nhis photographs of the\nVietnam War, in particular\nthose taken in 1968 when\nhe spent eleven days\nwith American troops.\nHis images depicting the\nimpact of the war on the\nyoung American troops,\nmany of whom are inex-perienced, contributed\nto the negative public\nimpression of the war\nback in the US, and the\nincreasing pressure to end\nit. His picture of \u201cShellShocked US Marine\u201d\ndepicts the blank face\nof a marine staring into\nthe distance, clutching\nhis rifle, traumatized by\nthe Battle of Hue, one of\nthe longest and bloodiest\nbattles of the war.\nDuring his stints back\nin England, McCullin continued to show an interest\nin documenting the\nmargins of society, of the\nsuffering in his backyard.\nBetween the 1960s to the\n1980s, he photographed\nmen and women living on\nthe streets of Aldgate and\nWhitechapel, in images\nentirely unrecognizable\ntoday, following extensive\ngentrification of the area.\nHe befriended many of the\nsubjects he photographed,\nand painted intimate portraits of those who were\nleft behind as the wealthy\nfinancial centre next\ndoor continued to surge\nforward.\nThis is an excellent\nexhibition that takes\nthe viewer through Don\nMcCullin\u2019s varied career,\non the way serving as a\ntour of modern history.\nThese photographs are\nintimate, sensitive works\nthat provide a window to\nimmense suffering, seen\nthrough McCullin\u2019s un-flinching, empathetic eye.\nThe Guvnors in Their Sunday Suits // Don McCullin\nBeautiful, inevitable // Laurent Liotardo\nTriplebillcelebratingtheworkoffemalechoreographers\nARTS\nMarena Grey\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Alumni\ncan also compete but will\nnot carry points for their\nrepresenting club. Entries\nare open for WT and ITF\npoomsae and sparring for\nall classes, beginners and\nexperienced alike.\nFor those unfamiliar,\ntaekwondo is a Korean\nmartial art, and WT\nsparring has been an\nOlympic Sports since\n1988. Poomsae is also\nknown as forms or\npatterns, where there are\nsequences of moves consisting of stances, blocks,\npunches and kicks. In WT,\npoomsae is also called\n\u201cKukkiwon patterns\u201d,\nand in ITF \u201cChang-hon\npatterns\u201d.\nOur Spring Championships medallists for\nKukkiwon Patterns, indi-vidual, are: Bryan Chong\n(bronze), Sophia Ppali\n(bronze), Claire Tjokroidjaja (bronze), Joonho Son\n(gold), Andrew Bates\n(bronze), and Cynthia Ho\n(gold). In pairs: Bryan\nChong and Sojin Park\n(silver), Sophia Ppali\nand Joonho Son (silver),\nAndrew Bates and Lucy\nLei (gold), Myriam\nBelmekki and Thomas\nKloska (silver). In teams:\nBryan Chong, Sojin\nPark, Syazana Hisham\n(silver) and Andrew\nBates, Cynthia Ho, Lucy\nLei (bronze).

In B and\nC-class, these are scored\nby corner judges whereas\nelectronic sensors are\nused in A-class. In ITF\nsparring, all points are\nscored by corner judges\n(typically three of four\njudges) and the winner is\nrevealed at the end of the\nmatch. 1 point for a punch\nto body, 2 or 3 points are\nscored for a kick to the\nbody or head respectively.\nITF sparrers wear more\npadding on guards for feet\nand hands with no body\narmours so sparring is\nsemi-contact.

It was a critical\nand commercial success\nand earned Peele an Oscar\nfor Best Screenplay. I\nlove Get Out. The thrill\nof riding this rollercoaster\nof a movie in a packed\nscreeningwasoverwhelm-ing. Peele impressively\ntoyed with the audience\nwith suspense and laughs;\nthe fine balance of horror\nand comedy was expertly\nexecuted. In addition to\nall of this, Peele weaved a\nsatirical thread of systematic liberal racism into the\nplot. Spotting the subtle\nimagery and throwaway\nforeshadowing statements\nwere like a treasure\nhunt. It was satisfying to\nunearth little nuggets of\ncontext and meaning in\nconversation with many\nfriends who enjoyed it as\nmuch as I did. It was the\nbalance of racial subtext\nwith fantasy horror which\ncreated a film with mainstream appeal. With the\nbar set high, is Us as good\nas it should be?\nUs centres on Adelaide\n(Lupita Nyong\u2019o), her\nhusband, Gabe (Winston\nDuke), and their children\nZora and Jason (Shahadi\nWright Joseph and Evan\nAlex), who are on a trip\nto their beach house in\nSanta Cruz. During her\nchildhood, Adelaide\nwent missing on holiday\nat the fun fair in Santa\nCruz, where she recalls\nseeing her doppelg\u00e4nger\nin a hall of mirrors.\nAdelaide is reminded of\nher childhood trauma and\nbecomes increasingly\nfearful when coincidences\nbegin happening. Indeed,\nthings take a turn south\nwhen Adelaide\u2019s family is\nconfronted by their doppelg\u00e4ngers with sinister\nintentions.\nFirstly, the film takes\nits time to develop\nAdelaide and her family\nthoroughly. It provokes\na lot of sympathy for the\ncentral characters, which\nis where the horror stems\nfrom. When things go off\nthe rails, we care about the\ncharacters \u2014 but it lacked\njeopardy. As intense as\nthe horror was, the film\nwas too sympathetic for\nits characters. The twists\nand revelations of the plot\nwere contrived yet pre-dictable, but on the verge\nof forgivable because it\nwas still enthralling to see\nit play out.\ntively done, from Michael\nAbels\u2019 chilling orchestral\nrendition of Luniz\u2019s \u2018I got\n5 on it\u2019, to the direction\nand choreography of\nthe mesmerising dance\nsequence.\nand the film\u2019s vagueness\nallows for different inter-pretations. It makes for a\nthought-provoking watch,\neven though the focus\nis muddied. Likewise,\nthe tone of the film is\nconfused too. The sparse\nmoments of humour\ndidn\u2019t always fit into the\noverall horror tone as\nwell as it should have, and\noften felt like a heavy foot\non the brake in the progression of the narrative.\nHaving said that, I loved\nthe mystical quality of the\nfilm akin to a Grimms\u2019\nfairy-tale, with a darkly\nsweet streak of malice\nrunning through its veins.\nThis balance of morbidity\nand enchantment is beautifully complementary in\nthe final act, where the\nsombre tone felt ajar with\nthe rest of the film.\nUs is not a film about\nrace. Sure, there are\nthematic elements and\nimagery that could point\nto a racial subtext, but\nnowhere is the race\nof Adelaide and her\nfamily made to be their\ndefining characteristic.\nAs someone who made\na seminal American film\nlike Get Out, I believe that\nPeele\u2019s deviation from\nracial politics is the next\nstep towards equality in\nthe industry and beyond,\nas contradictory as that\nsounds. Allow me to\nexplain.\nof minorities was for films\nto highlight the historical\nand systematic racism.\nThe plot of these \u2018phase\none\u2019 black movies often\ncentred around a character\nto overcome obstacles\nthat were set by their\nrace. The characters were\ndefined by the colour of\ntheir skin; their African\nheritage was built into\nthe narrative. From recent\ntimes, think 12 Years A\nSlave, Moonlight, Hidden\nFigures, BlaKkKlansman\nand Get Out. These are\nimportant movies in documenting and celebrating\nthe African American\nidentity, but it\u2019s becoming\nincreasingly ironic that\ntalented black actors are\npigeon holed into certain\nroles. Sometimes, a\nproduct of this system is\nthe black-character-to-fu-el-a-white-narrative-film\n(I\u2019m looking at you Green\nBook).\nNow, in response\nto the disproportional\nrepresentation in cinema,\nmainstream movies are\nstarting to make room for\npeople of colour on screen\nand behind the camera.\nWith this, we get diverse\nfilmmakers championing\nan underrepresented\nwave of talent allowing\nnon-white actors to take\non exciting and complex\nroles that traditionally\ncould have been a white-male-lead. This new\nattitude towards casting\ntranscends race and\nwould portray non-white\ncharacters, without the\ncolour of their skin being\na plot point. It is \u2018phase\ntwo\u2019, if you will, of black\nrepresentation in Hollywood. By extension, we\u2019d\nhope to see this kind of\nprogress for all minorities\nin the industry.\nJordan Peele\u2019s recent\ncomments that he\nwouldn\u2019t \u201ccast a white\ndude as the lead\u201d in his\nWith the bar set high, is Us as good as it should be? //\nWikimedia\nFILM\nFRIDAY, 3RD\nMAY, 2019 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18\nFILM\nSung Soo Moon\nFilm Editor\nDir: Jordan Peele.

Vice Provost\n(Education), Professor\nSimone Buitendijk, told\nFelix:\n\"There are all kinds of\ndifferent developments.\nThe Digital Learning\nStrategy is part of the\nLearning and Teaching\nStrategy, which I think is\nactually really important\nand exciting, it also gives\nthe College a niche. The\nonline courses are really\nvisible and exciting and\nwe have two now in\nthe making \u2013 one is the\nMaster's in Global Public\nHealth, which will start\nin the autumn, and then\nanother one is Master's\nin Machine Learning\nand Data Science by the\nMaths Department; that\u2019s\nbeen announced just early\nthis month and we\u2019re\nhoping to actually launch\nthat in the autumn of next\nyear, 2020. The Digital\nLearning Hub, which is\nanother big development\n- we have an experimental\nclassroom and a studio\nand desk space for editors,\nwhere we\u2019re going to\ninvite people in there,\nteachers who want to\nteach more interactively\nand want to try new technology in existing courses\nfor our own students to\nsee how we may make the\nlearning experience better.\nOn the prospect of\nincreased use of Virtual\nReality in teaching,\nSimone said the follow-ing:\n\"Now that\u2019s a really\nexciting development.\nOne of the new people in\nthe Digital Learning Hub\nis a specialist in AR/ VR\nand he\u2019s now going round\ntalking to lots of people\nabout how to bring that\ninto the teaching and it\u2019s\nso fun to see people from\ndifferent areas of exper-tise, like Omar with Fluid\nMechanics and people in\nMedicine around surgery,\nwork together on how to\nbring this into the actual\neducation. It\u2019s still very\nearly days but it\u2019s really\npromising. We\u2019re very\nmuch ahead of the curve\nthere. Of course, it really\nfits our profile, being so\nSTEM-focused.\"\nProfessor Buitendijk\nhas also been insturmen-tal in driving forward\ngeneral improvements on\nthe student experience.\nWith the College about\nto launch an awareness\ncampaign on Sexual\nViolence Liaison Officers,\nthe topic of student wellbeing also came up in\ndiscussion.\nFelix: I just want to\ngauge where we\u2019re at\nwith improving the\neducation experience\nsince launching the\nlearning and teaching\nstrategy\nSimone: We\u2019re doing\nvery well. It\u2019s early days\nstill. We actively started\nonly a year and a half ago\nand we\u2019ve already done\nthe complete curriculum\nreview, which I\u2019m really\nproud of and that was a\nhuge amount of work for\nevery department.Every\ndepartment has reviewed\nits undergraduate curricu-lum; the students coming\nin this autumn will all start\non the new curriculum and\nthat curriculum has more\nspace for innovations, less\nfocused on assessments\nand exams and particular\nways of testing, so it\u2019s not\njust curriculum review but\nalso assessment review.\nThe curriculum, the hard\nbit of actually formally\nreviewing it, that just\nneeded to happen and\nI\u2019m really proud of all\nthe teams that have done\nit. We\u2019re ready to go into\na new era with our new\ncurriculum.\nCan you go into a bit\nmoredetailintowhere\nthe money is being\nspent/ was spent\nThe Provost's Board\napproved the Learning\nand Teaching Strategy and\nthen, as a consequence of\nthat, we got the budget for\nthe first two years. We\u2019ve\nspent it, to a large degree,\non the curriculum review\nbecause we were very\naware that we can\u2019t ask\npeople who are already\nso busy with everything\njust to take on another\nhuge piece of work like\ncurriculum review so\nwe\u2019ve given all the departments that have gone\nthrough it extra help with\nextra teaching fellows;\nthey\u2019ve all done that so a\nlarge chunk of money has\ngone into that. Most of\nthe teaching fellows that\nhave been appointed have\nbeen appointed on four-year contracts because\nwe knew we wouldn\u2019t be\ndone in two years. We\u2019re\nexpecting departments\nto keep moving and now\nimplement the curriculum\nreview with the existing\nteaching fellows and that\nwill take care of the next\nbatch of money. Another\nbig spend has been to\ncreate faculty-wide teams\nin the faculties of Natural\nCciences and Engineering\nto think about digital\ntransformation. The\nDigital Learning Hub also\nhas its own budget. Those\nare the three biggest\npieces, apart from smaller\nprojects that we\u2019ve also\nfunded that help towards\nwhat we\u2019re trying to do.\nCould you shed\nsome light on some\nof the challenges\nthat you\u2019ve faced\nand also challenges\nthat you foresee\nwith implementing\nthe Learning and\nTeaching Strategy.\nI think they\u2019re challenges that face everybody\nwho\u2019s trying to implement\na big change program\nbecause it really needs a\ndifferent way of thinking\nabout teaching. Most\nresearch-intensive univer-sities, and Imperial was\nno exception, aren\u2019t really\nfocused that much on\nthinking about teaching.\nWe all have been taught\na certain way, we\u2019re very\nsuccessful people, so we\njust assume that we\u2019d\nbe doing that because it\nworks. To tell people that\nmaybe there\u2019s not a lot\nof evidence for lecturing\nas the primary way of\nteaching and, in this day\nand age, it\u2019s very important to build that sense of\ncommunity and work with\nstudents as partners, that\u2019s\na big culture change.\nThereareloadsofteaching\nfellows who are really\nexcited about this; they\u2019re\nteachers and researchers\nwho have already been\ntrying things, people like\nDavid Dye have been\ndoing this for quite a few\nyears now but they\u2019ve\nbeen working in relative\nisolation and now this\nis something that we all\nwant to embrace. Getting\neverybody on board, that\nrequires culture change, it\nrequires careful manage-ment, it requires rewarding the right behaviours\nand especially moving out\nof doing things on your\nown. For me, the most\nimportant thing is collaboration and getting out of\nthe relative competitive\nnature that we have. If\nwe want the College to\nbecome a better place for\nour students as a group,\nit\u2019s really important to\nfocus on collaboration\nand making sure that we\nimplement all the good\nexamples, we look at the\nparity of experience for\nstudents. I think that\u2019s\nreally important, that it\ndoesn\u2019t depend on which\ndepartment you\u2019re in to\nhave a good experience,\nthat every Imperial student\nneeds to have a good\nexperience in everything.\nOne thing I also really\nlove is the fact that we\nnow have the Centre\nfor Higher Education\nResearch and Scholarship\nled by Martyn Kingsbury.\nThat was previously only\nEDU [Educational Development Unit] and now it\u2019s\nmuch bigger. It\u2019s really\nlooking at making sure\nthat what we\u2019re doing gets\nevaluated, that we don\u2019t\nimplement things that\naren\u2019t working.\nVice Provost (Education), Professor Simone Buitendijk // Imperial College London\nI get the sense from\nlistening to you that\none of the main aims\nof implementing\nthe learning and\nteaching strategy is to\ngarner a tighter-knit\ncommunity within\nImperial.\nI think it\u2019s also creating\na sense of community\nin the classroom and\nthe breakout spaces, not\njust the community in\nthe Union, where people\ncome together to play\nsports and socialise, but\nalso a sense of community\nwith the teachers and with\neachother.\nI just wanted to know\nhow students have\nshapedthecurriculum\nreview.\nStudents have been\ninvolved. We\u2019re working\nreally closely with the\nUnion reps; they\u2019re pretty\nmuch in every meeting,\nwe\u2019re getting lots of\nfeedback from them\nand they, of course, are\nengaged with departmental reps, so we\u2019re trying\nas much as possible to\nget students on board in\nthe design. As much as\npossible, students also\ndelivered their input and\nthat\u2019s certainly how we\nwant to go forward. It\u2019s\nvery important to not just\nask students what they feel\nbut also make them part\nof the team that\u2019s building\nthis new way of working.\nSome things we\u2019ll be\ntrying for the first time\nhere and we won\u2019t know\nwhat works for students\nunless we do it together,\nwork with them, get that\nreally quick feedback.\nProvide some\ninformation about\nI-Explore please.\nThat\u2019s one of the\nexciting developments. In\nthe new curriculum, every\nundergraduate student\nneeds to have a five credit\npoint space somewhere\nin their curriculum, it\ncan be in the 2nd\nyear or\n3rd\nyear, to do something\nentirely different from\ntheir core curriculum and\nit counts towards their\ndegree. It will be pass/fail\nbecause that was easier\nand more acceptable and\nwe\u2019re hoping to have a\nbig choice of options;\nHorizons is going to be\npart of it, the Business\nfor Engineering Students\n(BPES) is going to be\npart of it. We\u2019re going to\ndevelop much more and\none of the ideas that the\nstudents brought in was\nmultidisciplinary projects\nbecause that\u2019s one thing\nthat students really want\n- more projects but then\nworking with students\nfrom very different disciplinary backgrounds.\nWe\u2019re asking departments\nto start developing those\nkind of projects.\nHow would you\nsay Imperial rates\nteaching-wise right\nnow and how do you\nthink it will rate once\nthe curriculum review\nand the Learning and\nTeaching Strategy are\nimplemented?\nI think right now we\nrate sort of average. I\ndon\u2019t think we\u2019re that\ndifferent from many\nsuper research-intensive\nuniversities, especially in\nEurope, but I don\u2019t feel\nthat\u2019s good enough for us.\nWe\u2019re so good in terms\nof our research and my\nvision is that, in terms\nof our education, we\u2019ll\nbe rated just as highly as\nwe are in terms of our\nresearch. I don\u2019t feel that\nthere\u2019s any competition\nthere, that either you\u2019re\nreally good at research or\ngood at education, I think\nit can go really hand-in-hand and where we have\nresearch-led education. I\nthink we\u2019re superbly positioned to make that work.\nWe\u2019ve just started so, if we\nkeep doing this, if we get\nto the level where the new\nway of thinking and the\nnew community building\nactually starts becoming a\nreality for every Imperial\nstudent, I think we\u2019re\ngoing to be very much\nahead of the curve and\nan example for lots of\nother universities. I don\u2019t\nknow of any university\non this planet that does it\nuniversity-wide. Cornell.\nfor instance, have done it\nwith their science faculty,\nUniversity of British\nColumbia have done it\nwith a few faculties but,\nbecause we\u2019re relatively\nhomogeneous in terms of\nour topics, we can do it\nuniversity-wide. I think\nthat\u2019s going to generate its\nown momentum because\nit\u2019s for every student; it\u2019s\nnot just if you\u2019re in the\nscience faculty, you\u2019re\nlucky but, if you\u2019re in\nanother faculty, you\u2019re\nnot.\nAre there any other\nways, outside of\nthe Learning and\nTeaching Strategy,\nthat Imperial could\nimprove on the\neducation front?\nI think the Learning and\nTeaching Strategy is an\nengine for bigger change\nbut, eventually, it will\nneed to go into all kinds\nof other areas aswell.\nFor instance, the career\nprospects of teachers and\nresearchers - how seriously do we take education\nas a career - that\u2019s hardly\npart of the Learning and\nTeaching Strategy but\nit also needs to go into\nour research strategy.\nThinking about students\u2019\nwellbeing more broadly,\nwhat student services are\ndoing, thinking about how\nwe work together between\ndepartments; with the\nLearning and Teaching\nStrategy as an engine for\ncollaboration and thinking\nabout parity of experience for students, we\u2019ll\nprobably see that will\nstart creeping into other\nareas of the College and\na wider culture and sense\nof belonging. I focused\non students but I think if\nour students have a very\npositive, good sense of\nbelonging, I can\u2019t imagine\nthat wouldn\u2019t also change\nhow our staff and teachers\nfeel about the College and\nbeing part of an exciting\ncommunity.\nHow can students\nget involved in\nincreasing that sense\nof community?\nStudents are getting\ninvolved and I think we\nare going to try and make\nthat happen more. In\nalmost every committee\nthat we now start, we are\nvery aware we need good\nstudent representation\nand, if students who read\nyour article would like to\nbe involved, I think the\ninvitation to go to their\nrepresentatives and say,\n\u201cwe want to be involved\u201d,\nis an open invitation.\nHow do the\nimprovements in the\nteaching strategy\netc. look outside of\nthe classroom, with\nregards to the student\nexperience and\nwellbeing?\nfuture of education at Imperial\nWell that\u2019s one of the\nthings that we\u2019re very\naware of, that we could\ndo better in terms of, for\ninstance, student spaces\nand common rooms and\nplaces for students to\ncome together. It\u2019s also\nthe layout on campus\nand how we make that\nwork - that\u2019s going to be\nanother big piece of work.\nWe know we can\u2019t just\nfocus on classrooms, even\nthough they also need im-proving, but also breakout\nspaces, common rooms.\nThe conversation ended\nwith discussions on the\nNational Student Survey\n(NSS), a postgraduate\npilot version of which\nis soon to be launched.\nSimone's final remarks\nwere:\n\"After last year\u2019s NSS\nresults, I\u2019ve actually\nconvened an NSS working\ngroup; first we were going\nto look at quick fixes,\nwhich we have identified,\nbut it\u2019s been a really\npositive exercise and\nwe\u2019re going to continue\ncoming together. It's\nHeads of Departments\nand tutors, it\u2019s very much\na cross-College group\nthat basically started by\nsharing good examples\nof how we can change\nstudent experiences positively so even departments\nthat weren\u2019t doing so\nwell in the NSS still had\ngood examples. It\u2019s been\nreally amazing group and\nstudents, of course, are\nvery much involved and\ntelling us what\u2019s important for them. I think we\u2019ll\nkeep that group up and\nrunning after the next NSS\nresults, whether they\u2019re\ngood or bad or medium, it\nalmost doesn\u2019t matter, we\njust need to keep thinking\nabout how to improve the\nstudent experience.\"\nWhen asked which\n\"quick fixes\" have been\nimplemented already,\nProfessor Buitendijk told\nFelix:\n\"One quick fix that\ncame up from a few\ndepartments was having\nstudent staff parties\nat the beginning of an\nacademic year. People\nreally enjoyed that and\nit\u2019s not that expensive and\nwe don\u2019t really have to\ndo a whole lot of work to\nmake that happen. Things\nlike that and, for instance,\nknowing that the common\nroom is really important\nand, of course, that\u2019s not\nfixed as easily when you\ndon\u2019t have one but at\nleast saying to eachother,\n'every student should have\ntheir own common room'.\nIt\u2019s been really useful to\ncompare and hear people\ntalk proudly about the way\nthey deal with the issues\nand what they\u2019ve done\nin their department and\nusing that for inspiration.\"\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1719\nFELIX\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nTom Alston\nInvestment Editor\nICIS Editor\nT\nhe ride haling\napp has lowered\nits expectations\nfrom a rumoured\nIPO valuation of around\n$100 billion to between\n$80-90 billion. This would\nstill be the largest public\noffering from Silicon\nValley since Facebook,\nwith the company pitching an initial price range\nof $44 to $55, even as\nmany other highly valued\ntech companies such as\nSlack enter the public\ndomain. Many believe this\nconservative pricing is a\nresult of the underwhelm-ing stock performance of\ncompetitor Lyft, which\nis currently trading 20%\nbelow its issue price after\nit went public earlier this\nyear. Lyft is in fact threatening a lawsuit against\nMorgan Stanley (one of\nthe underwriters of the\nIPO) after its alleged role\nin helping market certain\nproducts that would help\npre-IPO investors bet\nagainst the stock which\ncertain traders believe\ncaused the early drop in\nshare price.\nA Morgan Stanley\nspokeswoman told CNBC\n\u201cthe firm did not market\nor execute, directly or\nindirectly, a sale, short\nsale, hedge, swap or\ntransfer of risk or value\nassociated with Lyft stock\nfor any Lyft shareholder\nidentified by the company\nor otherwise known to\nus to be the subject of a\nLyft lock-up agreement.\u201d.\nInterestingly, Morgan\nStanley are lead underwriters of the Uber initial\npublic offering, in conjunction with Goldman\nSachs and Bank of\nAmerica. This raises that\neternal question; do banks\nrepresent the client or the\ninvestors and how do they\nUber\u2019s IPO documents\nshow how it has been\nspending heavily, burning\nthrough $2.1bn in cash in\n2018, maintain market\nshare. Its not surprising\nthat there are serious\nquestions about Ubers\nprofitability.\nAnother comparative\nexample could be Snap,\nwho went public for $24\nbillion in early 2017,\nlisting on the New York\nStock Exchange at $17 per\nshare. Now two years later\nthe shares trade at roughly\n30% below the listing\nprice. One might ask then\nwhy Uber wants an IPO at\nall, when there appears to\nbe clear evidence similar\nfirms have failed to raise\npredicted funds in the\npublic market. It could be\nbecause chief executive\nDara Khosrowshahi, and\nfour other top executives\nhave options for nearly 4m\nshares, a strong incentive\nfor them to move quickly\ninto an IPO.\nIt may also be that they\nhave exhausted private\ninvestment sources after\nSoftbank\u2019s vision fund\ninjected $7.7bn into Uber\nin January 2018 to become\nthe largest shareholder.\nHowever, what is\ninteresting is thatAlphabet\nand Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public\nInvestment Fund are\nnot selling any of their\nshares in the IPO. This\ntells us they still believe\nthere is potential for\nfuture growth, and that\nthey are willing to deploy\ncapital to maintain their\ninvestment if necessary.\nThis provides Uber was\na unique cushion, an\nadvantage for smaller,\nnewer investors.\nUber has also remained\nvery ambiguous about\nits key metrics. Analysts\nuse these to build models\nand forecast future\ngrowth of a company. For\nexample, the company has\ndecided not to disclose\nwhat the breakdown is\nof passenger rides and\nrestaurant deliveries\nis. Consequently, this\nmakes investors sceptical\nover whether Uber can\nbe accurately valuated.\nDespiteallofthesefactors,\nBloomberg was reporting\nas this article was written\nthat the Uber IPO was\noversubscribed by day\ntwo of the roadshow, with\nmeetings in London on\nMonday and New York on\n\u201cSoftbank\u2019s\nvision fund\ninjected\n$7.7bn into\nUber in\nJanuary 2018\nto become\nthe largest\nshareholder.\u201d\nmanage these conflicts of\ninterest? Uber has already\nwarned that existing\nshareholders might enter\ninto hedging deals that\nwould hurt its share price.\nFurthermore, in almost\nall respects, Uber is in a\nworse financial position\nthen Lyft. It is growing\nat a much slower rate,\nwith Uber\u2019s Take Rate,\nthe percentage of gross\nbookings it captures as\ncore platform adjusted net\nrevenue, has been steadily\nin decline throughout\n2018. Uber has also declining market share with\nno real competitive advantage that will allow it\nto earn a sustainably high\nreturn on invested capital\n(a key metric investor\nuse when investing in a\ncompany). Despite this\nCould Uber see a similar rocky ride similar to the one Snap experienced after its public offering?// FT\nAre Uber\u2019s bankers getting cold feet?\nTuesday. Only time will\ntell how the initial public\noffering goes this month\nbut observers will be\nwatching this bellweather\noffering carefully.\n\n"

Basically, during\nthe Iran-Iraq war, the\nUS shot down a civilian\nIranian plane killing\n290 civilians, possibly\naccidentally or possibly to\nflex their military muscle.\nWeird flex but okay. Our\ndelegate had to convince\nthe 15 judges that killing\n290 people is legal under\ninternational law by\nlooking for loopholes in\ntreaties. We lost the case\nbut at least we convinced\nfour judges that what the\nUS did was legal. International law is scary.\nOur delegate in the\nMaritime Committee\nfound that representing\nChina on the subject of\nMaritime trade is like\nrepresenting the US on\nfreedom, everybody\neither loves you or hates\nI\nmperial College\nModel United\nNations sent twelve\nof its finest delegates\n(and two chairs!) off to\nEurope\u2019s biggest MUN\nconference, LIMUN. We\nshowed up bright-eyed\nand eager on Friday after-noon, ready for what we\nknew would doubtlessly\nbe a great weekend. And\nboy were we right! It was\na weekend filled with long\nhours of debate, endless\nreunions with friends\nfrom previous conferences (half of whom you\nstill call by the country\nthey represented the first\ntime you met - because\nwho has time to learn\nactual names at MUN),\nand a black-tie ball where\nenough indiscretions\nwere spotted to ignite the\ncommittee gossip boxes\nthe next day.\nOur delegate in the\nSecurity Council heatedly\ndebated the situation in\nthe Korean Peninsula.\nAs the delegate of China,\nhe spent most of his time\ntrying to reach a deal\nwith the fierce delegates\nof the US and France. In\nthe end, an agreement was\nnot attained and vetoes\nfell on both sides; luckily,\nhowever, they managed to\nsolve their differences at\nthe ball, establishing superiority through a decisive\ncouncil dance-off.\nSaturday\u2019s Ball Night: Our delegates trying to forget that\nthey have 10 am sessions ft.

BADG\nis a campaign where\nMuslim Medics and\nImperial Islamic Society\ncollaborate to dedicate a\nweek to doing good to our\nlocal community. Inspired\nby a verse from the Quran:\n\u201cIndeed, those who have\nbelieved and done righteous deeds - they will have\nthe Gardens of Paradise\nas a lodging\u201d [107 - AlKahf], our volunteers set\nout to make a difference\nin the community.\nWe started off with our\nexclusive BADG styled\nShake Break, where the\nline-up of amazing events\nwere launched (and we all\nenjoyed some delicious\ntakeaway and cake!) We\nheard from the Heads\nof each event, and the\nbuildup of hype began!\nWe couldn\u2019t wait to get\nsee what amazing opportunities BADG would\nbring.\nThe week kicked off\nwith a stall in the SirAlexander Fleming Building.\nStudents and staff alike\nwere encouraged to\npledge a small creative\nact of kindness, such as\nbrightening up someone\u2019s\nday. They were given a\ncertificate and a goody\nbag too!\nOn Tuesday, a group\nof eager medical students\nbrought sweet treats and\nfriendly faces to elderly\npatients at Charing Cross\nHospital. The patients\nwere delighted to have\nvisitors and engaged in\njoyful conversation.\nThe next day consisted\nof something a little differ-ent. Enthusiastic students\ngot stuck in (literally!)\nand worked together to\nclean up a community\ngarden in Chelsea.\nOn Thursday, an altruistic group of students\ndonated blood at a nearby\nblood donation centre.\nThere was also a stall in\nthe Sir Alexander Fleming\nBuilding to encourage\nsignups. It was lovely to\nsee so much involvement\nfrom students, especially\nas blood donation has the\npotential to make a great\ndifference to those in\nneed.\nNext up, Saturday\nbrought a first-term\nevent for Imperial\nBADG. Medical students\ndelivered a talk about\ndiabetes and health\nawareness, in an effort to\nincrease knowledge about\ncommon diseases in our\ncommunity. The attendees\nbenefited greatly, from\nreceiving blood pressure\nchecks and information\n(with some of them even\nmaking notes!).\nAnd last but certainly\nnot least, Sunday saw our\nfirst ever Homeless Drive\nin collaboration with\nKCL and LSE. Hygiene\npacks as well as food\nand essential items were\ndistributed to those in\nneed in Holborn. It was\namazing to see our volunteers getting involved\nwith the homeless.\nTaking part in BADG\nalways serves as a good\nreminder that outside of\nthe bubble of our own\nlives, there are local\ncommunities and groups\nof people that can often\nuse our help. Too often\nwe become focused on\nhow we can make massive\nchanges to the world and\nsolve the big issues; and\nin the process we forget\nabout the little things\naround us.\nWe would like to\nthank everyone who\ngot involved, be it from\npledging a creative act\nof kindness at the stalls,\ncreating hygiene packs to\ndistribute to the homeless,\nor simply spreading the\nword about this campaign.\nWe couldn\u2019t have done\nit without you, and we\nlook forward to further\nopportunities to serve our\ncommunity together.\nBelly Dancing Summer Workshop: Polynesian Fusion\nT\nhe Belly Dancing\nSociety hosts\nweekly classes\nin Autumn &\nSpring Terms however,\nduring the summer, due\nto many of our members\nhaving exams, we pause\nour courses in favour of\nworkshops.

In previous\nyears, Move Out Day\nhas always fallen on the\nlast Saturday of term\n(which would be 29th\nJune), but this year it\nhas been pushed up to\nThursday 27th\nJune.\nThis will not affect the\nMove Out Day Concerns Addressed by College\nschedules of first years as\nCollege has planned the\nend of term for first year\nundergraduates to be 26th\nJune. College has ensured\nthat first year exams\nhave ended by this date\nand that there is minimal\nteaching during this time.\nHowever, for non-first\nyear students whose end\nof term date is 28th\nJune;\nthese students living in\nhalls have been contacted\nby Campus Services and\nStudent Services and will\nprovide them assistance\nif this presents complications for them.\nThe 27th\nJune move-out date was stated in all\naccommodation contracts,\nso residents were well\naware of the date, although\nfirst year students may be\nunaware of the deviation\nfrom past convention and\nreasons behind it.\nWhen approached\nfor comment, a College\nspokesperson said the fol-lowing: \"We have taken\nsteps to make sure disruption to students in halls is\nkept to a minimum. We\nhave communicated this\nconsistently throughout\nthe year including with\na \u2018Are You Ready?\u2019 publicity campaign across\nall campuses, so that\nresidents can ensure plans\nare in place with plenty\nof notice. We understand\nthat a very small number\nof students who are not\nfirst years but are living\nin halls may be affected\nby the change. Should\nstudents have any queries,\nwe encourage them to get\nin touch\u201d\nThe change of Move\nOut Day to Thursday is\nin parallel to a change in\norganisation of this year\u2019s\nImperial Festival, which\nwill be collaborative in\nnature for the first time,\nwith 19 other cultural\ninstitutions taking part.\nThe partnership with\nother institutions imposes\nconstraints on schedule\nflexibility and, as a result,\nthe Imperial Festival,\nusually held in April/May,\nwill be on 28th - 30th\nJune this year (and will\nbe named The Great Exhibition Road Festival to\nreflect the collaborations).\nPlans for the Festival\ninclude Exhibition Road\nbeing closed off, blocking\nvehicular access. Thus, to\navoid potential logistical\ndifficulties for students\nvacating the halls and\nfor the Festival, College\nmoved forward the date\nat which hall residents\nare required to move out.\nThough this logistical\nconflict would only affect\naccommodation halls in\nSouth Kensington, the\naccommodation contracts\nfor the nine first year halls\nare affiliated, so the same\nMove Out Day applies to\nall first year halls.\nFurthermore, these\nhalls will open for\ncommercial bookings\n(offering bed-and-break-fast accommodation) on\nSaturday June 29th\n(in\npast years they open on\nthe first Monday after\nterm ends), possibly to\naccommodate for an\ninflux of visitors during\nthe Festival weekend.\nInterim Head of Student\nVoice, Emelie Helsen.\nThis meeting comes\nas the College is in the\nprocess of writing its\nAccess and Particiption\nPlan, which is a document\nthey must write for the\nOffice for Students by\n23rd\nMay, outlining what\nCollege is going to do to\nensure that they are accessible to students from\na widening participation\nbackground and that they\nare supportive to those\nstudents while they are at\nImperial so they achieve\ngood graduate outcomes.\nThe plan is mostly about\nundergraduate home\nstudents and widening\nparticipation backgrounds\nrefers to BME (Black and\nminority ethnic) students,\ndisabled students, students\nfrom a low household\nincome, students from low\nparticipation neighbour-hoods, mature students,\ncare leavers and students\nfrom state schools.\nElements of the plan\nwere presented by Dr.\nMalcolm Edwards,\nDirector of Strategic\nPlanning, and this was\nfollowed by time for questions and discussion, in\nwhich those in attendance\nwere given the opportunity to provide feedback.\nMethods of improving access, including a\nfocus on BME students\nand socio-economically\ndisadvantaged students,\nand replicating programs\nsuch as Pathways to Medicine and STEM potential\nprograms outside London\nthrough a digitally-deliv-ered pilot program, were\ndiscussed at length. The\nCollege is also considering launching a program\nin London specifically for\nBlack students.\nData suggests that\nImperial performs well in\nterms of attracting black\napplicants but performs\npoorly in terms of admitting them, which could be\nindicative of unconscious\nbias present in the admissions process.\nAnother consideration\nthat needs to be taken into\naccount is the apparent\n\"attainment gap\" which\nexists for BME and WP\nstudents, and ensuring\nmeasures are also in place\nto tackle this.\nCollege has been\ndescribed as \"keen to get\nfeedback from a diverse\ngroup of students on the\nplan\".\nWork surrounding\nimproving access is\nongoing and largely\nalready underway.

    "content": "HP #WomeninTech Roundtable\nTech giants host event to tackle the issue of perceptions and barriers to women entering the tech sector\nTECH\nAndy Djaba\nEditor-in-Chief\nO\nn Wednesday\n10th\nApril, Felix\nattended a\nroundtable discussion on the perceived\nbarriers of women in the\nUK to joining the tech\nindustry.\nThe event was jointly\nhosted by HP and The\nFawcett Society, the\nUK\u2019s leading organisation\ncampaigning for equality\nbetween women and\nmen, and drew upon an\nindependent HP-commissioned study to find out\nwhy the industry struggles\nto attract women and what\ncan be done to help.\nGeorge Brasher,\nManaging Director of HP\nUK & Ireland chaired\nthe event and, following\nhousekeeping and a\nwelcome, introduced the\nplan for the session and\nopened the floor for those\nin attendance to contrib-ute. Addressing the group,\nhe said: \u201cAs a company,\nwe feel that diversity\ncreates benefits for us. But\nif you look at the numbers,\nwe have the same issue\nthat the industry does - in\nthat women are underrep-resented. Words are interesting but actions create\nresults.\u201d\nThere were representatives from business,\nmedia and government at\nthe roundtable and Vicky\nFord, MP for Chemlsford,\nprovided an update on\nwhat the government is\ndoing to tackle the issue:\n\u201cWe know that tech\nand entrepreneurship\nare linked, but less than\na penny in the pound\ngoes to all-women businesses compared to 89p\nto all-male businesses.\nThat\u2019s why Government is\nputting more money into\nstart-up loans. They\u2019ve\nput \u00a31m into another\nfund, and \u00a320m into the\ninstitute for coding\u2019s diversity project.\u201d However,\nshe also added, \u201cit\u2019s got to\nbe led by business\u201d.\nSam Smethers, Chair\nof the Fawcett Society,\nthen took over chairing\nduties, adding, \u201cPart of\nthe problem is where we\nstereotype what\u2019s normal\nfor girls. If we don\u2019t get\nin at that early stage, we\nare swimming against the\ntide.\u201d To spark initial con-versation, she then invited\neveryone at the discussion\nto contribute one sentence\non what they would\nchange to get more young\nwomen into tech. Sam\u2019s\nsentiments were largely\nechoed, with many people\nhighlighting how crucial\nit is to \u201cstrike early\u201d in the\nlives and careers of young\nwomen. Debbie Forster,\nChair of Tech Talent\nCharter added: \u201cI\u2019m from\nan education background\nso I completely agree that\nit\u2019s important. George\nalluded to the fact that\nthere\u2019s a problem with\nwomen who \u2018didn\u2019t catch\nthe right flight\u2019 - how do\nwe do retraining and move\nwomen from consumers to\ncreators. Tech desperately\nwants women, and 50%\nsay they would retrain.\nClaire MacDonald\nfrom Computer Weekly\nconcurred, stating: \u201cthere\nneeds to be more of a\nfocus along the entire\npipeline. Even if young\nwomen follow a tech path,\nthey often find that it\u2019s not\nthe inclusive environment\nthey want or need\u201d.\nMany recurring themes\nwere discussed, especially\nthe topic of effective re-training, maternity leave\nand how to effectively\ncollaborate with schools\nand the education sector\nto tackle this issue. When\nthe topic of representation\nat senior positions in tech\ncompanies was raised, it\nopened up an interesting\ndebate about the use of\nquotas. Ultimately, the\nroundtable discussion\nsucceeded in providing a\nplatform through which\nideas could be shared and\nthe issues were able to be\ndiscussed in an open and\nfruitful manner.\nAfter the roundtable\ndiscussion, Felix spoke\nto HP Graduate, Steph\nAudeh, and HP intern,\nVera Hansen, who started\nworking at HP in January\n2019 and July 2018,\nrespectively, about their\nexperiences working in\ntech.\nHow has it been so\nfar? What\u2019s your\nexperience been as an\nintern/ graduate?\nSteph: It\u2019s been great.\nI\u2019ve had some serious\nexposure to amazing\nprojects in sustainability,\nin diversity, on innova-tion. I\u2019ve had a wealth\nof opportunities in three\nmonths. It\u2019s a little bit\ninsane, in a great way.\nVera: It\u2019s been great.\nMy role is supporting\nGeorge, the Managing\nDirector, and his Chief of\nStaff and his Executive\nAssistant. It\u2019s a great\nrole. Like Steph, I\u2019ve had\na range of experiences\nand exposure. I\u2019ve been\nworking on Brexit, I\u2019ve\nbeen working on a lot of\nthings, it\u2019s a really broad\nrole that I love.\nWhat\u2019s been the\nhighlight?\nSteph: The highlight\nso far is the work I\u2019ve\nbeen doing with diversity\nactually. It\u2019s one of my\npassions and we\u2019ve been\nworking closely with\nDebbie from Tech Talent\nCharter. We\u2019ve been to\na couple events, now we\nhave this, and I think,\nbecause it\u2019s one of my\npassions, it\u2019s one of my\nhighlights, working in\nprograms to increase\nawareness on diversity\nand women in tech.\nWhat would you say is\nthe biggest challenge\nyou\u2019ve faced both\nin working here but\nthen also in increasing\nawareness about\ndiversity like you\nmentioned?\nSteph: I think it\u2019s when\nI arrived, it\u2019s quite a steep\nlearning curve. You\u2019ve\ngot to go and you\u2019ve got\nto absorb a lot of information and understand what\ncompanies are doing and\nbest practice. It\u2019s complex\nand to get your head\naround it in such a short\nspace of time to get up\nto speed was quite tricky.\nSo I think one of my\nchallenges is absorbing all\nthe information and then\ntaking a logical approach.\nVera: In terms of chal-lenges, I agree, it\u2019s kind\nof the onboarding and the\ntaking everything in but\nthen I think, especially\nat HP, we have a lot of\nsupport. We have mentors,\nwe have our managers, no\none ever says no really, if\nyou ask for help.\nFrom the discussions\nhad today, what\nwould you say is your\nmain take home\nmessage?\nSteph: My main take\nhome message was collaboration actually. I think\nthe fact that companies\nshouldn\u2019t be doing it in\nsilos, whether you\u2019re\ncompetitors or you\u2019re\nfrom different areas in the\ntech background or other\nbackgrounds, it\u2019s the fact\nthat the only way we\ncan move is all together.\nThat\u2019s my key take-away;\nand the fact that it needs\nto be sustainable and\nscalable. It\u2019s not a short\nterm thing.\nVera: It\u2019s slightly con-tradictory. Like you said\nabout collaboration and\npartnership, that\u2019s really\nimportant but then I loved\na point that George made\nthat tech is such a competitive industry and starting\nputting metrics on things\nwill really bring change\nbecause, if HP starts\ngetting public measures\non diversity, then other\nfirms will try to compete,\ngiven the nature of the\nsector. I think that would\nreally make a boost, if\neveryone starts publically\nputting more measures on\nthe subject.\nFinally, what sort of\nadvice would you give\nto women to get to a\njob in HP or a job in\ntech?\nSteph: Be open to op-portunities. When I started\napplying for placement,\nRetraining could bring more women into the tech industry // Hannah Radvan\nTECH\nFRIDAY, 3RD\nMAY, 2019 FELIX\ntecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n8\nbecause I was an intern\nat HP, I didn\u2019t actually\nconsider tech. I almost\nstumbled into it and it was\nbeing open to it; I had a\nbit of reservation \u2013 do I\ngo, do I not? Just do it, see\nwhat it is, you might love\nit. It\u2019s the fact that, maybe\nwhen I was going through\neducation, I wasn\u2019t open\nto those sort of opportunities - you can have a\njob in a tech company in\na non-technical capacity.\nTry and experience as\nmany sectors as possible\nand just be open to\nit because you might\nstumble on a passion\nyou\u2019ve never realised.\nVera: I think I have\nto agree. Like Steph, I\nstumbled into tech and,\nbecause in my course\n[Business Management] a\nplacement is compulsory,\nI was applying to a wide\nrange of sectors and\nslowly the applications\nI was getting further in\nwere all in tech. I was\nreally surprised. It\u2019s\ntaken me down this path\nbut I\u2019m really loving it.\nThe dynamics and the\nfast-pace of this sector\nis amazing. You always\nfeel at the forefront so I\nreally encourage people to\njoining the tech industry;\ntech or non-technical\njobs, it\u2019s a really good\nexperience.\n\n"
