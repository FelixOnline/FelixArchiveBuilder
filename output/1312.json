    "content": "Many are keen to pursue a\ncareer in consulting. Reasons\nwhy include good money, a\njet-setting lifestyle and the\nchance to tell MDs how to\nrun their companies.\nGraduates aiming for the\nCity often choose consulting over banking due to the\nproject based and problem\nsolving nature of the work.\nA career in consulting is a\nlifestyle choice, which gives\nthe opportunity to work for\nmany different companies in\na succession of different chal-lenges. There is the satisfaction of making a difference\nand seeing people take over\nyour ideas and put them into\npractice successfully.\nConsultants tend to specialise in one or more areas\nthat could be divided into four\nmain types:\n\u2018Generalist\u2019 includes the\nlarge consulting firms offering\na wide range of services from\nstrategyconsultingandhuman\nresources to IT. Examples\nof these are Accenture,\nDeloitte Consulting, IBM\nBusiness Consulting Services\nand Computer Sciences\nCorporation.\n\u2018Strategy consulting\u2019 are\nthe smaller organizations\nthat offer strategic advice to\ncompanies on a project-by-project basis. This involves\nlong range planning, the reorganization of a company\u2019s\nstructure, rationalization of\nservices and products, and a\ngeneral business appraisal of\nthe Company. Within this category are firms like McKinsey\nand Bain.\n\u2018Human resource consulting\u2019 firms offer specialist\nadvice in personnel policy,\nmanpower planning, job\nenrichment, job evaluation\nand industrial relations.\nThey include Aon Consulting,\nMercer Human Resource\nConsulting and Towers\nPerrin.\n\u2018Niche firms\u2019 consist of consultants leaving the larger\ncompanies and setting up\ntheir own consultancy firms\nin a particular sector, or offering a specialist service.\nIn a consulting situation,\nthere are usually five \u2018phases\u2019\nto a process: entry (contact-ing and contracting); diagno-sis; implementation; consoli-dation; and evaluation.\nResponsibility is a pillar of\na successful consulting proc-ess, together with empathy\nand trust. The client finds\nhimself in a situation without\nthe ability to resolve it. When\nassignments go wrong, inevitably consultant and client\nhave a rather different perception of the situation. The\nclient will usually believe that\nthe consultant did not come\nup with any original ideas and\nproduced recommendations\nwhich were either impratical\nor otherwise unacceptable.\nFrom the consultant\u2019s perspective it may look a little\ndifferent: the client did not\nprovide an adequate briefing.\nThey could never make time\navailable for meetings but\nstill wanted everything done\nin a hurry.\nSo, if such a challenging\nenvironment attracts you,\nhere are some tips:\nYou will need to display a\nwide range of personal quali-ties. A would-be consultant\nmust possess the following\ntraits:\n\u25cf Integrity \u2013 your client\u2019s\nneeds come first\n\u25cf An analytical mind \u2013 every\nproblem must have a solution\n\u25cf Clarity of expression \u2013 both\nverbally and in writing\n\u25cf Empathy \u2013 the ability to\nrecognise another person\u2019s\npoint of view, although not\nnecessarily agreeing with it.\nIt is not important to have a\nbusiness-related degree and\nit is advisable to take subjects that you will enjoy and at\nwhich you will excel, as grades\nare the most important factor\nto firms. Do as much research\nas possible before choosing\na consultancy. Talk to firms\nyou are interested in and to\npeople who have worked with\nthem.\nThere are several good\nsources of information on a\ncareer in consultancy, such\nas the MCA (Management\nConsultancies Association)\nwebsite, www.mca.org.uk,\nand the IMC (Institute of\nManagement Consultancy)\nwebsite, www.imc.co.uk.\nLooking for a career in consultancy?\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005\n10\nCareers felix@ic.ac.uk\nGABRIELLA SILVESTRI &\nCASSANDRA ALDRICH\nCAREERS EDITORS\nMichael Walton (Imperial\nalumnus) set up his own consultancy business. He tells\nFelix about his line of work:\nHow would you define\nwhat consultancy is to\nstudents?\nThis is difficult, but I would\nsay that in my industry, a consultant is a person or company which supplies various\ntechnical services that cannot be conducted with the client\u2019s own resources. These\nservices are usually related\nto projects and have a limited\ntime span, and a well-defined\n\u2018result\u2019. Alternatively, a consultant is often called in on\nan ad-hoc basis as a trouble-shooter, often in a legal situation as an expert witness.\nAfter you graduated did\nyou already know that\nyou wanted to get into\nconsultancy?\nNo, this was never planned,\nbut being attracted to major\nprojects, it was the only path\nto take in the long term.\nDid you have different\njobs in between finishing\nyour studies and going\ninto consultancy?\nYou have to gain a wide range\nof experience to have credibility as a consultant. This can\nonly be achieved by putting\nin the years at various levels\nof responsibility in industry.\nI worked in production and\ntechnical services before joining a consultancy. I then had\na five year stint as a sales\ndirector importing industrial\nconsumables, before returning to consulting with my own\nbusiness. So that\u2019s 12 years\nproduction/tech, eight years\nconsulting, five years sales,\nand a further eight years on\nmy own.\nDo you think being at\nImperial equipped you\nwell for your career?\nPartly, but when you leave\nwith your degree, the real\nwork starts \u2013 you basically\nonly have limited technical\nknowledge, and no experience of industrial practice\nand technology in a real\nsense \u2013 especially IR issues.\nAnother big issue here is the\ninteraction of various disciplines needed in a major\nplant, particularly process\nand maintenance engineers.\nDo you have any advice to\nstudents wishing to get\ninto this field or advice\nresulting from your expe-riences?\nDo not choose consultancy\ntoo young. Spend at least\nfive years, preferably more,\nbefore considering this, as it\nis easy to be pigeon-holed.\nThe best way to get into this\nis with a large engineering\nconsultant such as Bechtel\nor KBR. This allows a wide\nrange of experience quite\nquickly.\nAny additional information or thoughts?\nI would hesitate to recommend starting out by oneself\ntoo young, it is not easy \u2013 I\nam over 50! Some commercial experience is also needed\nto avoid financial pitfalls. A\nbusiness course would be\nvery useful.\nTips from an Imperial graduate\nCareers\nevents\nEmployer drop-in\nsession\nDeloitte\nWed 9 Feb, 12 \u2013 5pm.\nSign-up begins Mon 17 Jan.\nBook at Imperial Careers\nService.\nEmployers skills led\nworkshops\nPricewaterhouseCoopers /\nPsychometric Testing\nWed 26 Jan, 1.30 \u2013 3.30pm\nVenue: SAF 120.\nSign-up begins Mon 10 Jan.\nIBM assessment centres\nWed 2 Feb, 1 \u2013 3pm\nVenue: SAF 119.\nSign-up begins Mon 10 Jan.\nPostgraduate Study &\nTraining Fair 2005\nWed 26 Jan, 12.30pm\n\u2013 7.30pm.\nBusiness Design Centre,\nIslington, London.\nMBA Fair 2005\nWed 26 Jan, 12.30pm\n\u2013 7.30pm\nBusiness Design Centre,\nIslington, London.\nProcter & Gamble\nRecruitment\nPresentation\nTue 2 Feb, 7pm.\nTo save time on arrival, preregister at pgevent2005@pg.\ncom.\nThe Strand Palace Hotel,\nThe Strand\nIntroducing Careers in\nDevelopment\n15 Feb.\nBy the end of the day you will\nhave a realistic and informed\nview of the sector together\nwith practical tips on how to\nget into it.\nCost:\n\u00a320 \u2013 University of London\nstudents and members of\nGradClub\n\u00a340 \u2013 All other participants.\nFor more information, email\nmilkround@careers.lon.\nac.uk.\nIntroducing Careers in\nCharities\n16 Feb.\nThis new course will cover\nthe main career areas:\ncampaigning, fundraising,\npolicy-making and lobbying,\nresearch, marketing and PR,\nadministration and project\nmanagement.\nFor information, email\nmilkround@careers.lon.\nac.uk.\nConsulting: solving big business problems in a challenging environment\n\n"

The\nworld\u2019s most entertaining\nroyal didn\u2019t so much stick in\na toe as belly-flop into the\nwaters of controversy again\nthis week after photos of\nHarry dressed as a Nazi were\nleaked to The Sun.\nThe relief on the pages\nof the tabloid was palpable.\nAfter weeks of being serious and worthy while writing about the tsunami, at last\nthey had a chance to do what\nthey do best \u2013 write about the\nroyals and do some serious\nmealy- mouthed moralising.\nThe fact that what Harry\ndid was indeed extremely\noffensive to large numbers of\npeople round the world (and\nit was reported all around the\nworld) was immaterial \u2013 all\nThe Sun wanted was another\nchance to point, laugh, and\nthrow a few stones.\nSo the editorial was\nsuperb. \u201cOld soldiers will\nbe sickened when they see\nthe young prince behaving\nlike a drunken member of\nthe Hitler Youth,\u201d shouted\nthe paper, suggesting dubiously that \u201cThis outfit will\njust encourage British neo-Nazis and racist skinheads to\nbelieve that their sick views\nare right\u201d.\nMeanwhile, they praised\nWilliam\u2019s choice of costume\n(a leopardskin leotard with\npaws and tail. And they wonder why this country is going\nto the dogs).\nThe Mirror stooped so\nlow as to get the waitresses\npresent to comment on how\n\u2018well-endowed\u2019 William is\nand how lovely he looked in\nhis spangly leotard. Oh, dear\nLord.\nThe fact that Harry\u2019s great\ngrandfather Edward VIII was\na Nazi supporter was gleefully\nbrought up by The Guardian\nand The Mail, both of whom\nalso questioned whether the\nprinces should have attended\nthe party, which was held by a\nBritish Olympic showjumper\nwho also happens to be one\nof the people who invaded the\nLabour party conference in\nsupport of hunting.\nThe Telegraph was sym-pathetic: \u201cWe can all agree\nthat Prince Harry is not very\nbright... it would be ludicrous to suggest that the\nprince was displaying any\nsympathy for Hitler when\nhe wore what looked like the\nuniform of Rommel\u2019s Afrika\nKorps\u201d.\nBut the same newspaper\nalso remarked: \u201cThis is not\nthe stupidity of a 20-year-old,\nwho has gone through 17\nyears of the best formal education that money can buy.\nIt is the stupidity of a rather\nbackward child of 12,\u201d and\ncastigated Prince Charles for\nhaving insufficient control of\nhis children. Even William\ncame in for some bashing \u2013\nas the \u2018sensible one\u2019, he was\nexpected to have suggested\nto his brother that perhaps\nHitler was not the best fancy\ndress role model.\nHowever, just when the fuss\nwas dying down, the papers\nlatched onto the fact that\nHarry\u2019s blunder could have\ncost London its 2012 Olympic\nbid. The London bid is largely based around the city\u2019s\nstatus as officially the most\nmulticultural city on earth;\na member of the royal family\nprancing around as a member of the SS is not really in-keeping with that idea.\nThe Queen\u2019s comments that\nshe thought the bid would go\nto Paris didn\u2019t help either, for\nthat matter. Until then, the\nLondon bid had been seen\nas by far the most dynamic,\nand some thought that it was\ncatching up on the French\nfavourite. Now, some serious\ngrovelling is required if the\nbid is to get back on track\n\u2013 the IOC members begin\nto visit the five bid cities in\nMay.\nHarry\u2019s Nazi blunder\nBy Siddharth Singh\nRAG spokesman\nRAG is proud to announce\nthat it has just received a\nletter of support from Brian\nMay, the lead guitarist from\nQueen.\nMr May was an undergraduate in the Physics department at Imperial College. In\nhis letter, he recounts his own\nexperience at Imperial and\nthe need for students to be\naware of and committed to\nworthwhile causes.\nMeanwhile, the total has\nnow reached \u2018never before\nseen heights outside RAG\nWeek\u2019 of \u00a33569.38.\nOn behalf of Imperial RAG,\nI would like to ask all of you\nto contribute in whatever way\nyou can. More craziness is\nplanned for RAG Week.\nBrian May offers support to\nImperial RAG\u2019s tsunami appeal\nFormer Imperial student Brian May\u2019s letter to RAG encourages students to contribute\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nMech eng library\nsafe for now\nThe mechanical engineering department\u2019s library and\nreading room will not close or\nbe moved in the immediate\nfuture.\nDiscussions have taken\nplace on the possible clo-sure, as reported in Felix\nissue 1310, but the decision\nhas been deferred \u201cfor some\ntime,\u201d according to Helen\nDawson, the department rep-resentative.\nMs Dawson said: \u201cThere is\nthe option of making the reading room a faculty room for\nthe use of engineering students in general so that it will\nnot be lost.\u201d\nShe offered a note of cau-tion, warning that \u201cthe fight is\nnot over for good\u201d and pledging to make sure that students are better represented\nwhen similar issues are considered in the future.\nHalal chicken\nin College\nAll freshly prepared chicken\ndishes served in the main\nImperial College catering\noutlets at South Kensington\nwill be halal from Monday\nonwards.

A nice little action-packed Disney movie called\nNational Treasure. Stick in super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer and\nyou have a recipe for box office\nsuccess.\nNational Treasure tells the story\nof one man\u2019s quest for the ultimate\nprize \u2013 a treasure so wonderful that\nseveral generations of his family\nhad spent their lives (and their family fortune) in search of it.\nAccording to legend, since the\ndawn of civilisation a hoard of\npriceless objects has been build-ing, fought over by everyone including the ancient Egyptians, Romans\nand Greeks. This treasure had been\npassed down through the ages until\nit was discovered by the mysterious\nTemplar Knights who decided that\nit was too great to be possessed\nby any one person. Over time, the\nKnights became known as a secret\nsociety, the Free Masons, leading\nto the treasure being hidden during\nthe American war of Independence\nby the US\u2019s Founding Fathers. It\nhas been lost ever since.\nThis is where our hero Benjamin\nFranklin Gates (Nicolas Cage)\ncomes in. He is beginning the last\nstages of his family quest, which\nleads him to steal The Declaration\nof Independence which cleverly has\nthe treasure map on the back of it.\nCage plays the lead with humour\nand gives his character the doggedly determined nature and infinite intelligence that one would certainly need in order to get from one\n\u2018clue\u2019 to the next, because there are\nan awful lot of clues.\nThe makers of this film seemed\nto have tried to squeeze in as\nmuch American history as possi-ble. Clues are everywhere \u2013 on the\nLiberty Bell, the letters of Benjamin\nFranklin, Wall Street and even the\none hundred dollar bill. It is, there-fore, just a little far fetched for them\nto expect us to believe that the\nAmerican Founding Fathers had the\ntime and wit to devise such cryptic\nmessages.\nIt is even more difficult to believe\nthat one man could possibly follow\nthis hopeless trail. But follow it he\ndoes, and he is not alone, accompanied by his young sidekick, Riley\n(Justin Bartha), and Abigail (Diane\nKruger). Sean Bean is also along\nfor the ride and is again typecast as\nthe villainous Englishman who will\ndo anything to get his hands on the\nprize. Cameo appearances by two\nHollywood legends also help to add\nacting weight to this picture.\nThe film is slightly jagged and\nuneven, with the first hour made\nup of a few action sequences and\nlong periods of clue deciphering.\nHowever, as the end draws near, all\nthings intellectual are left behind\nas chase sequences and shoot-outs\ndominate. There is not enough violence to terrify little children but\njust enough to keep an older audience watching.\nCage and Kruger have a nice\ndynamic between them, as their\ncharacters start out with a relationship of animosity that later leads\nto mutual respect. There are many\nscenes spent lingering on the fact\nthat the Declaration is the most\nimportant document in history\nwhich is, of course, only Hollywood\u2019s\ninterpretation of reality. Not knowing that much about American his-tory, I also could not dispute how\nthe story has been woven with\nthe events that happened during\nAmerican\u2019s emancipation from the\nBritish. But even to my uneducated\nmind, I think there has been just a\nlittle bit of artistic licence taken.\nNational Treasure has proven\nto be a big box office draw in the\nUnited States, but it seems a little\ntoo patriotic to do very well here. I\ndid enjoy the film, but only because\nof the enduring Indiana Jones feel\nto it. I would recommend it only to\nthose who appreciate this kind of\nmovie. Mandirassa Osakonor\nA diamond in the dust?\nHollywood puts a new spin on American history\nNational Treasure\nDirector: Jon Turteltaub\nStarring: Nicolas Cage, Diane Kruger,\nJustin Bartha, Sean Bean, Jon Voight,\nHarvey Keitel\nLength: 131 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHII\nNational Treasure: the first spin-off from the highly successful Dan Brown novel The Da Vinci Code\nVeer-Zaara: a love legend\nDirector Yash Chopra brings us a\ntale of love, courage and integrity.\nThe aim of this movie was to overpass the differences between Indian\nandPakistanipeople(again)through\na \u2018forbidden\u2019 love story between\nan Indian pilot, Veer Pratap Singh\n(Shah Rukh Khan), and a Pakistani\ngirl, Zaara Hayaat (Preity Zinta).\nHence the title of the movie: VeerZaara.\nBefore going any further, the\nauthor would like you to consider the possibility of a rescue pilot\nwho sits in prison without speaking\nto anyone for 22 years but upon\nmeeting a young beautiful Pakistani\nlawyer Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani\nMukerji), who calls him by his name\nas opposed to his prison number,\ndecides to speak. Not only does he\nspeak, he tells his whole past to\nher, which keeps the movie going\nfor three hours. So you would have\nto let your imagination run wild,\nsuspend you sense of disbelief and\nbelief in impossibly passionate love\nbetween two people. Just a little.\nThe past starts off with Veer, a\nrescue pilot. He meets a carefree\nand beautiful girl, Zaara, who came\nto India to fulfil her nanny\u2019s dying\nwish. Zaara is trapped, due to a bus\naccident, and Veer saves her, which\nleads to an unshakable bond that\neventually ties them up in unconditional and irreversible love. Veer is\nmesmerised by Zaara\u2019s beauty and\nmorals while Zaara is swept away by\nVeer\u2019s passion to help others and his\nundying love for her.\nThe story also includes the colourful and merry set of Veer\u2019s home\ntown Punjab, where Zaara meets\nhis uncle (cameo part for Amitabh\nBachchan) and aunt (Hema Malini),\nhis foster parents. This couple do\nnothing but argue adorably during\ntheir scenes and you can\u2019t just help\nsmiling throughout their lines. This\ngives a hint of comedy to the movie.\nAfter this innocent visit of Zaara\u2019s to\nIndia, Veer\u2019s life is never the same\nas destiny has a different \u2018ending\u2019 to\ntheir \u2018happily ever after\u2019.\nHowever, this movie does tend to\nseem like a normal romantic love\nstory where boy meets girl: both\nfall in love, the parents resent it,\ntherefore girl has to marry the guy\nchosen by her parents, then coura-geously, the man goes over to the\ngirl\u2019s house to win over the girl.\nThough this film does have this sce-nario, there is a little surprise from\nthe master of romantic movies. The\nstory is moved across two nations\nwith different cultures. It isn\u2019t just\na love legend, but a transformation\nof Veer. The audience is kept riveted\nwith twists that change the current\nair of the movie.\nThis is a simple tale of immense\nnobility and idealism that may\nstrike some viewers as implausable.\nModern day isn\u2019t filled with demean-our, speech, attitude and emotions\nthat bring out the human spirit. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t let ourselves\nbe immersed into an idealistic love\ntale. After all, when you add the\namazing shades of emotions thrown\nby Shah Rukh (including the wonderful facial expressions) with the\ncheerful and down-to-earth acting\nof Preity and the overly-teary but\nconfident scenes of Rani Mukerji\nto the utterly beautiful theme song,\nthis movie allows you to surrender\nto the romantic passion between\nVeer and Zaara. It\u2019s as simple as\nfalling in love.\nThe score, with lyrics by Javed\nAkhtar and music composed by\nthe legendary late Madan Mohan,\ncomes with an outstanding quality\nof sound that reminds us how far\nBollywood movie music has come.\nThe soundtrack takes you to places\nwhere the heart dances and the soul\nsings out in pure bliss. It\u2019s a lovely\nfeast for the ears. Movie music cannot get any more intimate. Putting\ntogether this music with colourful dresses, beautiful scenery and\ngood choreography brings up a good\nentertainment.\nIn short, Veer Zaara is a movie\nthat will appeal to nearly all who\nhave imagination beyond realism.\nHowever it does lack an innovative\nplot structure.\nThis is a movie that will make you\nlaugh and cry. All in all, it\u2019s an emotional film that certainly needs to\nbe seen, if only because Shah Rukh\nKhan is in it.\nVidula Vinayagamoorthy\nVeer-Zaara\nDirector: Yash Chopra\nStarring: Shah Rukh Khan, Preity\nZinta, Rani Mukerji, Kirron Kher\nLength: 193 minutes\nCertificate: U\nHHHHI\n\u201cEven to my\nuneducated mind,\nI think there has\nbeen just a little\nbit of artistic\nlicence taken\u201d\nBollywood strikes again\n\n"

    "content": "By Andy Brown\nSilwood Park Correspondent\nThe end of the calendar year\nhad come at last. For most\nof the Silwood residents,\nChristmas is a stressful time\nof the year, with exams before\nand after the break, and a\nquiet time for those who are\nnot going home.\nBefore we departed, we\nhad a couple of days to let off\nsome steam. This year saw\nthe return of the much-loved\nSilwood review, a light-heart-ed look at the world of science\nand life on the campus over\nthe past year. It is a night\nloved by all, a time to get a\nbeer and have a laugh, with\nthe added bonus of raising\nmoney for charity. It is a night\nlike no other, where everyone is put on a level playing\nfield, from the gardeners to\nthe campus Dean, everyone\nlaughs at others\u2019 expense and\nthen doesn\u2019t complain when\nthe jokes come on to them.\nThis year\u2019s story took a\npanto tale and added an element of Silwood individual-ism. Dick Whittington leaves\nhis PhD at Silwood with his\nsubconscious bunny compan-ion, in search of fame after\nbeing fed up with living in\nthe middle of nowhere. After\ncoming across many interesting characters on his travels,\na Brummie-accented voice\nfrom above tells him to go\nback to Silwood and run for\nUnion President against the\ncampus Dean.\nOn his returning trip, he\npasses a Richard and Judy\nshow, our Union President on\nblind date picking a romantic\nholiday with his supervisor,\nand course organisers trying to explain and justify why\none course consists solely of\nfemale students. At one point,\nsomehow, all the senior lecturers end up on stage doing\nthe \u2018macarena\u2019.\nAfter some strenuous cam-paigning, Dick wins and is\nworshipped by all Silwood\nresidents, gets his girlfriend\nback from the Dean, and they\nlive happily every after (with\nthe exception of some senior\nlecturers who were left trau-matised). Congratulations\nhave to be given to Tom\nEzard, Kelly Moyes and Katy\nBarton for scriptwriting and\norganising the rabble.\nThe following morning was\nChristmas Day (a little bit\nearly, admittedly, being the\n17th). The day started off\nbright and early. Well, early\nyes, bright no! Our traditional\nChristmas morning fun run\nwas welcomed with wind and\nrain, which made it a little\nless fun! But did that stop any-one, of course! The Christmas\nfairy, a few elves, a superhero\nand even the Christmas tree\nhad dragged themselves out\nof bed to do the three mile\nrun/walk around the grounds\nand roads of Silwood. For the\nmore serious runners, this\nwas not even a walk in the\npark and they had finished\nlong before the vat of mulled\nwine and tray of mince pies\nwere warmed up!\nOnce everyone had had a\nchance to dry off, the day continued with the lazier residents finally getting out of bed\nand joining everyone else in\nthe main hall for some expertly sung Christmas carols, with\nthe odd serenade by a very\nmerry, slightly intoxicated,\nChristmas tree! Christmas\ndinner followed, with only\nthe odd attempt to catapult\nfood to neighbouring tables.\nIt was a serious scientific\nexperiment trying to get the\nweight, shape and moistness\nof a brussel sprout just right\nthat it would be projected off\nthe end of a party popper for\nthe correct distance, although\nthe winner had to be the age-old flicking mince pudding off\na spoon.\nThe evening\u2019s entertainment commenced as we finally managed to get a karaoke\nmachine and continued to\nimpress all of Silwood with\nour singing ability...\nThe only person really worthy of holding the microphone\nwas the Christmas fairy\nwith her rendition of Alanis\nMorissette\u2019s Ironic. However,\nas the drink continued to flow,\nthis didn\u2019t stop anyone from\nbelieving they were the next\nBritney Spears or Will Young.\nChristmas at Silwood\nAround Campus felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005 11\nTHURSDAY\n20 JANUARY\nTALK\nENGINEERS WITHOUT\nBORDERS\n1pm\nRoom 342, Mech Eng\nPriti Parikh discusses slum\nnetworking in India.\nContact:\njignesh.parekh@ic.ac.uk\nUNION EVENTS\nPINKS: ANN SUMMERS\nPARTY FOR BREAST\nCANCER CARE\n6.30pm\ndBs, Beit Quad\n\u00a33.50\nAn evening to raise money for\nBreast Cancer Care, including organised entertainment\nfrom Ann Summers, auctions\nof eligible bachelors, blind\ndate and a raffle.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n17\nAt 74, Clint Eastwood has certainly\nearned the right to kick back and\ntake life easy. The fact that he\u2019s\nstill active and involved in quality\nfilms is definitely the movie-going\npublic\u2019s gain.\nAs someone who does not like\nfilms with violence just for the sake\nof it, I would probably have avoided\nthis one if it were not for the stellar cast \u2013 and I\u2019m glad that I was\nswayed. This is not a film about\nboxing; it is a film with boxing in it\nthat delicately deals with themes of\nmorality, forgiveness, perseverance\nand human relationships without\nfalling into the Hollywood trap of\nlabouring the point to hammer the\nlessons home. The pace is steady,\nbut not dull, and the subtlety of the\nfilm makes it a pleasure to watch\nrather than the torture of sitting\nthrough a sermon.\nIf you have not yet seen the film\nand don\u2019t know much about it, my\nadvice is don\u2019t read any further.\nAvoid other reviews and the film\nsynopsis, and just go see it.\nEastwood gives his usual grizzled performance as Frankie Dunn,\na trainer who finally has a fighter\nwith a chance at the championship\ntitle and is adamant that he does\nnot train girls. Hilary Swank makes\nthe film her own and is outstanding\nas Maggie \u2013 white trash who desperately wants to make something\nof herself through boxing and has\ndecided that Frankie is the trainer\nto get her there. The progression\nof their relationship from surly old\nman and over-eager wannabe to\ngruff but caring trainer and promising fighter is gently steered by\nScrap (Freeman), a former fighter\nwho helps out at Frankie\u2019s gym.\nThe supporting cast does not\nlet this fantastic trio down: Jay\nBaruchel (Danger, the gym\u2019s\ndummy) steals every scene he is in\n\u2013 praise indeed considering the company he is in \u2013 and Brian O\u2019Byrne is\nthe most \u2018human\u2019 Catholic priest\nI\u2019ve ever seen, exasperated beyond\npatience at Frankie\u2019s deliberate\nneedling, and refusing to take any\ncrap. Maggie\u2019s trailer park mother\n(Margo Martindale) has to be seen\nto be believed.\nEastwood\u2019s direction is beautifully\ndone, with moody lighting and gritty\nimages of Frankie\u2019s dingy gym making way for brighter and cleaner\nshots as the relationships between\nthe characters, and Maggie\u2019s\ndreams, progress. Little finishing touches are everywhere, such\nas Maggie\u2019s galloping into every\nfight with hedonistic enthusiasm,\nFrankie\u2019s small involuntary smile\nwhen she wins her first fight, and\nScrap\u2019s satisfaction at making it to\nfight 110.\nThe script is excellent, with the\ngriping and bickering between\nFrankie and Scrap the highlight. In\nfact, it comes so naturally to them\nthat it seems as if the scriptwriter has documented Eastwood and\nFreeman hanging out and having\n\u2018grumpy old men\u2019 conversations.\nThe only flaw was Frankie teaching himself Gaelic \u2013 as a device\nfor character development it was\nunnecessary, and was a jarring note\nbecause of its randomness.\nThe action scenes are superb, but\nnot for the squeamish. The choreography makes the fights absorbing, so\nmuch so that I found myself twitching along with Frankie (although\nI resisted doing air punches) and\nsmiling in relief whenever Maggie\nwon a fight. Frankie\u2019s methods of\nstemming the bleeding from cracked\ncheekbones and broken noses made\nme wince far more than the actual\nfighting.\nThis is a thought-provoking film,\nthoroughly deserving of the awards\nit has gathered.\nIt\u2019s a knockout\nAfter Mystic River\u2019s phenomenal success, Clint Eastwood returns with his 25th directorial\noffering \u2013 another candidate for the Oscars, says Robin Wilkinson\nMillion Dollar Baby\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\nStarring: Clint Eastwood, Hilary\nSwank, Morgan Freeman\nLength: 132 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHHHI\nThe ugly stick beat on these two quite heavily\nScorsese\u2019s best shot at an Oscar (again)\nThey said that Kundun would be a\nmasterpiece. It wasn\u2019t. They said\nthat Bringing Back the Dead was\nhis most powerful film since Taxi\nDriver. But it was rubbish. They\nsaid that Gangs of New York was\nMartin Scorsese back at his very\nbest. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\nIt was against this backdrop of\ndisappointment after disappointment that I went to see Scorsese\u2019s\nbiopic of legendary aviator Howard\nHughes.\nThe Aviator begins with Howard\nHughes (Leonardo Di Caprio), the\nson of a wealthy Texan industri-alist, as director and producer in\nHollywood, making some of the\nmost influential and ground-break-ing movies of the 1930s. The film\ncovers his relationships with some\nof the industry\u2019s most beautiful\ndivas such as Katherine Hepburn\n(Kate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner\n(Kate Becksindale).\nBut Howard Hughes was much\nmore than just a movie-maker. His\nmost important legacy is to be found\nin the aviation industry. Without\nHughes\u2019 innovations in engineering,\ncommercial air travel may never\nhave become possible so quickly.\nThe film also looks at the rivalry\nbetween Hughes\u2019 airline TWA and\nthat of Pan-Am, which was owned\nby his rival Juan Trippe (Alex\nBaldwin).\nAway from the glamour of Hughes\u2019\nplayboy Hollywood lifestyle,\nScorsese does not flinch from looking at the darker side of the story\nand Hughes\u2019 inner demons, which\ndrove him to achieve, but were to\neventually destroy him. Hughes suffered from a host of psychological neuroses, symptoms of which\nincluded paranoia and obsessive\nhand-washing. His problems grew\nworse as he grew older, and the\nfilm reflects this (although we are\nspared seeing Hughes in his later\nyears when his condition turned\nhim into a complete recluse).\nVery rarely in American cinema\nare American heroes presented in\nthis way, and credit goes to Leonardo\nDi Caprio whose surprisingly excellent performance balances the bipolar nature of Hughes\u2019 character to\nOscar-winning perfection.\nThe film runs just shy of three\nhours and this can be an issue. It\njust seemed to repeat itself over and\nover again, the standard sequence\nbeing Hughes faced with challenge,\nHughes surmounts challenge ingen-iously, Hughes confronts psychological problem, Hughes faces another\nchallenge, and so on and so forth.\nYou feel that the film is not actually\ngetting anywhere. Thankfully, the\nsuperb cinematography, the trademark Scorsese sweeping camera\nmovements and the lavish sets compensate greatly for this fault.\nAbove all The Aviator, similarly\nto Forrest Gump, is a promotion of\nthe American Dream. You leave the\ncinema with the feeling \u201cif Hughes\ncould do it then I can do it\u201d. If\nHoward Hughes or Forrest Gump\ncould change the course of history\nand overcome their respective challenges then anyone can make it\nin America. The difference is that\nForrest Gump was an entirely fic-tionalcharacterandHowardHughes\nlived and became the richest man in\nthe world. The difference is that The\nAviator is not purely an ode to the\nAmerican dream, as Forrest Gump\nwas, but a thoughtful and brilliantly\nmade reminiscence of America in\nits heyday. Darius Nikbin\nThe Aviator\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate\nBlanchett, Kate Beckinsale\nLength: 170 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHHHI\n\u201cMy advice is don\u2019t\nread any further.\nAvoid other reviews\nand the film synopsis\nand just go see it\u201d\nGolden Globes 2005 Best director winner Clint Eastwood (far left)\nGolden Globes 2005 Best dramatic actor Leonardo DiCaprio in The Aviator (Best dramatic film)\n\n"

    "content": "If you read the article next to this,\nor if you are a fan of dance, you will\nhave gathered, or in the latter case\nalready be well aware, that Sadlers\nWells is London\u2019s most exciting\nvenue for dance.\nSadlers Wells hosts a wide range\nof performances ranging from bal-let, of the avant garde variety or\notherwise, to rather less classical\nexpressions. They are also a venue\nto which visiting opera companies\ncome.\nMany of Matthew Bourne\u2019s rather creative reworkings of classic\nballets are staged at Sadlers Wells\nwith great regularity. Other Bourne\nballets include Cinderella and The\nNutcracker, which, like Swan Lake,\nare well-established and loved clas-sics. Modern re-workings are not to\neveryone\u2019s tastes, but if you\u2019re curious and don\u2019t want to take yourself\nout to Farringdon you can get a good\nselection of DVDs of his ballets \u2013 you\nneedn\u2019t leave home as you can order\nthem via the internet. Or, if you are\nfeeling energetic, you could go to\nsee performances of Bourne\u2019s ballet\nHighland Fling at the beginning of\nMarch.\nCurrently, Sadlers Wells is hosting the Flamenco Festival London\nuntil Sunday 30 January. This is the\nsecond year in which the festival\nhas run, and this year you can even\nmake the most of post-performance\nenthusiasm and take part in flamenco classes following the show at\nSadlers Wells. During the two-week\nduration of the festival, a wide range\nof dance troupes and star dancers will be performing traditional,\ncontemporary and more forward-looking versions of this iconic dance\nform.\nA number of companies will be\nvisiting Sadlers Wells later on this\nyear, including the Phoenix Dance\nTheatre, the Northern Ballet\nTheatre and the legendary Sylvie\nGuillem with \u2018The Ballet Boyz\u2019 (yes,\nthat is an atrocious name). This year\nhas already seen highly acclaimed\nperformances of stark, modern,\nsomewhat conceptual works by the\nSan Francisco Ballet.\nFor more information on Sadlers\nWells, go to their website at www.\nsadlerswells.com. Season programmes for the main stage\nand the subsidiary stages are\navailable there, as well as booking\ninformation.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\nA dear friend decided to treat me\nfor Christmas by taking me to see\nwhat turned out to be one of the\nmost exhilarating shows I have ever\nwatched, and I have watched a good\nfew!\nFor a Tchaikovsky fanatic like\nme, who is familiar with the music,\nMatthew Bourne\u2019s Swan Lake was\ndeeply touching, and by the end of\nthe show I was left with an overwhelming mixture of emotions and\nshock. His contemporary take on\nthe original story is his passport to\nfreedom to exercise what would normally be unacceptable in conventional ballet, from the homosexual\nnature of the love story to the 21st\ncentury humour and social issues\nthat amused and thrilled the audience throughout.\nThe story revolves around a prince\nwhose royal lifestyle has left him\nwith deep complexes about his self-worth and a craving for love. While\nhis mother, the Queen, indulges in\nthe power and vanity that come with\nthe job to have all pleasures at her\nwill, he grows up longing for a caring touch that finally seems to be\nfulfilled after falling in love with a\nswan, who he meets when trying to\ntake his own life in a lake.\nThe twists and turns of the story,\nthough beautifully crafted, leave\nthe audience with a deep feeling of\nshock, as the swan later turns up\nat a royal party as a man and tries\nto seduce the Queen. The Prince is\ndevastated and is locked away by\nthe Queen, as he is thought to be\nmentally ill. The swans, which seem\nto have been a figment of his imagination to fill the emotional gaps in\nhis life, revisit him in the last scene,\ntheir rage ultimately depriving the\nlovers of their lives; the Prince is\nfound dead by his regretful mother\nthe next day.\nThe set design and the costumes\nwere magical, but then again they is\nrarely less than perfect on the West\nEnd. What really sets this production apart is the dancers\u2019 graceful\nability to evoke very powerful emotions in the audience, and I strongly\nrecommend everyone to see it at\nleast once.\nUnfortunately the current run has\nnow ended, so you will have to wait\nfor another revival. The ballet was\npremiered in 1995, so surely a tenth\nanniversary run will be in order.\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSomething of a more traditional\ntake on Swan Lake, as presented\nby the Moscow Ballet.

There\nwere no arguments more\nthan a couple of words, and\nhappy smiling faces all round\nat the end. What more could\nyou want? A close sporting\ncontest? Done.\nIt was a fantastic game.\nThough ICSM dominated,\noften with eight or nine players camped in the opposition half for minutes on end,\nGeorge\u2019s would eventually\nrelease the pressure with a\nclassicArsenal-inspiredbreak\nthat at the very least kept our\ngoalkeeper Rao entertained\n(he who complained at never\ndoing anything). For the first\ngame after Christmas, it was\na bravura display from the\nThirds, with everyone playing\ntheir best game this season. It\nmight be down to pride, or the\nfact that the team has played\ntogether virtually unchanged\nall season. Personally I put it\ndown to sheer freakish luck.\nWe started the game slightly apprehensive \u2013 rumour\nhad it that they had a South of\nEngland ringer in their midst,\nbut we managed to conquer\nthat demon by spending\nthe entire first five minutes\ncamped in their half. This\ninitial domination settled the\nteam down and we started to\nplay some champagne hock-ey. There were runs, spins,\nand even passes. However,\nthis domination didn\u2019t lead\nto goals. For all our attacking prowess, George\u2019s managed to put up an impressive\ndefensive display and looked\nto counter at every available opportunity. Fortunately\nour defensive boys were also\nplaying like legends, just like\nthe guys up front.\nEventually, after many\nchances flashed past the goal\nor straight to the keeper, the\npressure paid off with Avi,\nnewly promoted from defence\nto wing, popping his cherry\nlike a pro with a deft finish\nafter some ping-pong action\nin the goal-mouth. One-nil.\nDespite trying to up our\ngame even further for the\nrest of the half, wary of a\nquick break, we couldn\u2019t force\na breakthrough and Rao was\ncalled upon to make some\ncracking interventions. After\nhalf time it remained much\nthe same \u2013 lots of pressure,\nlittle breakthrough. Until sud-denly, from out of nowhere,\nTerry slapped in a cheeky little number. Two-nil.\nThen, straight from the re-start, a bit of devilry from our\nforwards stole the ball, and\nwith a little bit of faffing Terry\nslammed it straight into the\nback of their net to make it\nthree-nil. Credit to George\u2019s,\nwho came back for more and\ndidn\u2019t let their heads drop.\nThe last ten minutes allowed\nTerry some cracking hat-trick\navoidance, but by then it was\nalready tied up.\nThis was frankly the best\ngame of hockey that I\u2019ve ever\nplayed \u2013 fun, tiring and bloody\ngood spirit.

The fact that it takes\nsix weeks to get pay for some shifts\nis of course ridiculous, but I think the\nmost important part of your article\nto highlight was what Mustafa Arif\nhad to say about non-student casual\nstaff still being paid weekly!\nWhen the change happened, we\nwere told that it was necessary for\nus to have our pay scheme changed\nin order to bring us in line with the\nrest of college\u2019s staff, as this would\nreduce costs in payroll. The fact that\nthere are still staff being paid weekly\nby college payroll enforces my belief\nthat it was not necessary to fast-track all of us student staff onto the\nscheme. There could have been far\nmore time for negotiation with the\nUnion and planning by the college\nto make sure that if it did eventually\nbecome truly necessary for us to be\non monthly pay, it could have gone\nahead without all the glitches we\nhave experienced. These included\nnot being paid, being paid too much,\ntax and NI not being deducted, emergency tax being deducted and so on\nad infinitum...\nPerhaps, too, if we had been\nwarned of this change, those of us\nwho are hard up enough to need our\ncash \u201cup front\u201d would have had a\nchance to make alternative arrangements before the start of term. It\nwould have been even nicer if we\nhad been consulted on the change,\nbut then again, as it seems that\nMustafa himself was barely consult-ed, that might be like asking for the\nmoon on a stick.\nYours,\nJess Baker\nIV Chemistry with Management\nSecurity and medics\nDear Felix,\nToday, Tuesday 18 January, a student\nhad a fit in the entrance hall of the\nSir Alexander Fleming Building.\nStudents present at the time\nwere reported to have done nothing\nexcept continue to purchase their\nfood from the shop while watching on. Eventually a student had\nthe sense to ring Sherfield Security\n(of which there should be a fully\ntrained medical officer at all times),\nafter which four (allegedly) burly\nbut medically incompetent guards\nappeared with no first aid equipment and proceeded to join in the\nstaring contest.\nParamedics were eventually called\nand arrived within minutes and dealt\nwith the situation accordingly. One\nof the students who originally aided\nthe suffering student was rewarded\nby a \u2018Well done miss,\u2019 by one of the\nsecurity officers.\nLessons to be learnt from this:\nSherfield Security need to review\ntheir procedures for first aid train-ing; medical students really don\u2019t\nknow what they\u2019re doing even when\nthreatened with a real life situation.\nKind regards,\nName and department supplied\nMore exam anguish\nDear Felix,\nI\u2019d like to write a short response to\nMr Rorke\u2019s letter in issue 1311.\nCan I just point out that I personally pointed out to Mr Rorke the\nissues several weeks before the end\nof the autumn term and heard nothing back from him on the subject\nand it was up to the students themselves within their departments to\nkick up a fuss to get their exam\ndates changed! Surely since dates\nare confirmed two years in advance\nas (Sam so courteously pointed out\nto the readership), the DPEWs of the\nlast three years had plenty of time to\nrealise the problem far earlier?\nYet another example of the union\u2019s\nbumbling inability to see into the\nfuture and take preventative action,\nleaving them shrugging their shoulders and scratching themselves; letting the students down inevitably.\nYours Sincerely,\nTim Weinert-Aplin\nAero 4\nDear Felix,\nTwo weeks ago I had a letter published here. Despite it being anonymous I have since received some\nreprecussions. I would like to re-iter-ate the points in the article 2 weeks\nago.\n1) In response to a Felix headline\nlast term I pointed out that Mech\nEng was not the only department\nwith a ridiculous Christmas period,\nwe in ESE also had problems \u2013 fault\nfor this in my opinion clearly lies\nwith college who set the term dates\n\u2013 why we could not have started that\nterm earlier I do not know.\n2) Also in response to a Felix headline last term, examinable material\n(indeed an exam) was scheduled\nin the lunch period \u2013 clashing with\nsome peoples humanities courses\n(hence why nothing should be timetabled in the lunch hour). The only\noption I was given was to sit it in\nthe afternoon, which clashed with\na departmental lecture. I eventually sat it then. I believe no student\nshould be put in this position \u2013 I do\nnot accept that Monday 3rd being a\nBank Holiday as an excuse, it has\nbeen scheduled then for a long time.\nIf exams were indeed supposed to\nhave being scheduled for the \u2018first\nMonday\u2019 of term (10th) then there\nwould not be a full day of departmental lectures that day. I believe blame\nfor this lies with the department,\nas other departments don\u2019t seem to\nhave had this problem.\nThe point I was trying to make\nwas that individually these problems\nwould not have been that bad but\ncombined between them they could\ncause students great distress in\nwhat is an important year of there\ndegree.\nI would also like to point out and\napologise to the secretarial staff of\nthe department, who may have misunderstood the article, I believe they\nare not at fault for the above prob-lems, the job they perform, which\nincludes being a link between students and the department is performed consistently in a faultless\nmanner with a cheerful attitude, and\nall the more admirable bearing in\nmind the \u201cfluid and laissez faire\u201d\nnature of the department (as discussed above and in my previous\nletter).\nThankyou\nJohn Sykes\nMSci Geology (3rd year)\n(The Still Disgruntled Rock Hunter)\nBabar Ahmad\nDear Felix,\nWe, the family of Babar Ahmad,\nreject outright and condemn the\ndecision of the Independent Police\nComplaint\u2019s Commission (IPCC) to\nformally discipline one of the several Anti-Terrorist Branch Police\nOfficers who caused life-threaten-ing injuries to Babar whilst in their\ncustody on 02 December 2003. We\nfurther question the timing of this\ndecision, more than a year after the\nassault, and a week prior to BBC2\u2019s\ndocumentary on Babar\u2019s case on\n26th January 2005. We feel that this\nis a cynical ploy to create a scapegoat out of one officer to spare the\nsuperiors from blame.\nOur faith in the British Justice\nSystem is such that we always\nexpected a \u201ccover-up\u201d from the\noutset, but we did not expect the\nIPCC, Crown Prosecution Service\nand members of the medical profession to be part of it. This is the\nfourth time that the authorities have\ncharged their version of events of\nwhat happened to Babar on that\nday. First they declared in court that\nBabar\u2019s injuries were old injuries.\nThen they said that \u201csome\u201d of the\ninjuries were old. Then they said that\nBabar kicked, punched and violently\nresisted arrest. Now they are saying\nthat the injuries were not old and\nsome of the officers used excessive\nforce. They have also claimed that\nthe officers acted as such because\nthey believed Babar to be a highly\ndangerous terrorist who trained in\nAl-Qaida camps.\nThis latest decision leaves a\nnumber of questions unanswered:\n1) If Babar violently resisted arrest\nand attacked police officers, why\nwas he not charged with assaulting\npolice?\n2) Where is the medical evidence\nof any injuries sustained by the\npolice officers?\n3) If only one police officer assaulted Babar, why did the others stand\nthere and watch?\n4) Why did 3 independent eyewitnesses (neighbours) inform the\ninvestigation that they did not witness any struggle?\n5) WhyhasBabar not been charged\nwith making false allegations against\nmembers of the police?\n6) If Babar was a highly dangerous Al-Qaida terrorist, why was\nhe released without charge in\nDecember 2003?\n7) Why did the IPCC ignore the\nopinion of Dr Manolis Gavalas, an\nindependent medico-legal expert\nwho examined Babar?\nWe would like all of the officers\nconcerned to be charged and pros-ecuted, not just disciplined with a\nslap on the wrist. We are considering taking further action and we\nseek an urgent independent public\ninquiry into this matter.\nFamily of Babar Ahmad\n\u25cf Terror Suspect\u2019s Dad, a documentary on the \u2018Free Babar Ahmad\u2019\ncampaign, will be shown at 10pm on\nWednesday 26 January on BBC2.\nFun in Felix?\nIt saddens me to write this. In years\ngone by, the pages of noble Felix\nwere filled with interesting columns\nand funny stories. So much so in fact\nthat my vastly inferior writing skills\nwere never called upon. Now, howev-er, things have changed. Very much\nfor the worse. First we lose the format for cost reasons \u2013 fair enough.\nBut did you have to cull all the writers as well? I mean you didn\u2019t even\npay them. They had vision, skills and\npossibly even ideas.\nThe idea of a student paper is not\nto deliver daily news from the business world, or even daily national\nnews. That\u2019s what actual newspapers are for. A student paper should\noffer information about student life\n\u2013 funny events, places to eat, general\ncrude. It should be interesting. Fair\nenough we\u2019re all geeky enough to\nappreciate computers and gadgets.\nBut maybe more reviews of games\nand funky stuff and less dry pieces\nabout operating systems \u2013 which\nas anyone knows, aren\u2019t interesting,\neven to mac fanatics.\nYou need to have information on\nhow the university is being run and\nplans for the future. You also need\nto have columns on how wonderful\ndonuts are and how ignoring deadlines seriously reduces dancing ability at dB\u2019s. However, these shouldn\u2019t\nnecessarily be vying for space in the\nsame column.\nSo what needs to be done?\nBasically there needs to be a drive\nback towards fun \u2013 everyone needs\na break from knowledge occasionally\nsurely? Is there really no place for\nfannying about? What are we, serious scientists or students? There is\nso much more to life than studying.\nI mean really there is. No matter\nhow much you pay to study, you\u2019re\nmissing out on the whole aim of university if you use it just to work. Like\nmeeting people, having fun, maybe\neven putting something back into the\nuni and/or the community. But obviously it is not obligatory \u2013 I would\nnot be where I am today if it weren\u2019t\nfor my highly developed sense of\napathy and a keen knowledge of how\nbest to avoid doing stuff. Still I know\nthat occasionally a little effort makes\neverything better. In this instance,\nit is mainly that if by some quirk of\nfate I manage to encourage people to write something, I will have\nsomething to read and I won\u2019t have\nto spend weeks deciding whether\nor not to write something instead\nof staring blankly into the Mission\nFailed screen of GTA 3.\nTristan Lane\nMedic, 5th year\nDave Edwards, Editor, replies:\nFelix is a popular newspaper this\nyear. Almost all of our 4000 copies disappear quickly each week. I\nhave received more compliments\non the new style of Felix than I could\npossibly count.\nCost was only one factor behind\nthe change of format. The new \u2018compact newspaper\u2019 style defines Felix\nas a student newspaper, rather than\nlying somewhere between newspaper and magazine. The new style\nlooks more like a \u2018real\u2019 publication\nand is taken more seriously and\ngiven more respect as a result.\nWe didn\u2019t cull any writers \u2013 they\neither left College or just stopped\nwriting, unfortunately. To imply\nthat our current team of contributors lacks vision, skill and ideas is\na cheap and ultimately pointless\ninsult to these hard-working, talented volunteers.\nMany Imperial students are interested in national and/or business\nnews, and we are able to give a\nlimited amount from our own per-spective, so why shouldn\u2019t we do\nthat? The operating system articles\nhave attracted several comments\nand questions from readers \u2013 it\u2019s\nclear that people are interested in\nthat kind of thing.\nOf course there is space for \u2018fun\u2019\narticles, but we need people to write\nthem. Incidentally, Coffee Break\nalready offers two pages of fun\nand games each week. I\u2019m not sure\nthat we should be offering \u2018general\ncrude\u2019, whatever that is.\nAny student is welcome to write\nfor Felix.

A federal\njudge ruled last Thursday\n(13 January) that the stickers were an unconstitutional\nendorsement of religion.\nOfficials from the Cobb\nCounty School District, in\nsuburban Atlanta, put the\nstickers inside the books\u2019\nfront covers in 2002. They\nread: \u201cThis textbook contains material on evolution.\nEvolution is a theory, not a\nfact, regarding the origin of\nliving things. This material\nshould be approached with an\nopen mind, studies carefully\nand critically considered\u201d.\nThe stickers were to counter\ncriticism from over 2,000 parents that the new textbooks\ndid not include information\nabout creationism or \u2018intelligent design\u2019. The case was\nbought by the American Civil\nLiberties Union on behalf of\nfive parents concerned that\nthe stickers encouraged their\nchildren to reject the scientific theory of evolution in favour\nof a religious view on origin.\nAccording to the decision:\n\u201cThe sticker sends a message\nto those who oppose evolution\nfor religious reasons that they\nare the favoured members of\nthe political community, while\nthe sticker sends a message\nto those who believe in evolution that they are political\noutsiders. This is particularly\nso in a case such as this one\ninvolving impressionable public school students who are\nlikely to view the message\non the sticker as a union of\nchurch and state.\u201d\nThe basis for the decision\nis interesting, hinging on\nwhether the stickers violated\nthe Establishment Clause of\nthe First Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution.\nThis clause states that\n\u201cCongress shall make no law\nrespecting an establishment\nof religion, or prohibiting\nthe free exercise thereof\u201d,\nand also applies to states. It\nmeans the government must\n\u201cpursue a course of complete\nneutrality towards religion\u201d.\nIn his decision, the judge\ntook the viewpoint of an\ninformed, reasonable observer \u2013 someone aware of the\nevents leading to the adoption of the sticker and that\nthe language of the sticker\nessentially mirrored the viewpoint of religiously motivated\ncitizens. Even though the\nsticker may not have explicitly advanced a particular religious viewpoint, considered\nin context, the judge decided\nthat an informed, reasonable\nobserver would take the sticker to mean that the School\nBoard agreed with the beliefs\nof the Christian fundamentalists and the creationists.\nThe judge concluded, there-fore, that the stickers must\nbe declared unconstitutional.\n\u201cIt coveys an impermissible\nmessage of endorsement\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe Board has effectively improperly entangled\nitself with religion by appearing to take a position\u201d.\nThe stickers, funded with\ntaxpayers money, were\nalso found to violate the\nConstitution of the State of\nGeorgia. This says that: \u201cNo\nmoney shall ever be taken\nfrom the public treasury,\ndirectly or indirectly, in aid\nof any church, sect, cult or\nreligious denomination or any\nsectarian institution\u201d.\nThe areas outside the scope\nof the case should also be\nnoted. Namely, the case did\nnot consider whether science\nand religion are mutually\nexclusive (it took no position\non the origin of the human\nspecies); whether it is constitutionally permissible for\nstate school teachers to teach\ncreation; or whether evolution is a fact or theory or how\nit should be taught.\nIn the US, there is a long\nhistory of Christian fundamentalists and creationists\nopposing evolution. As early\nas the 1920s and continuing\ninto the late 1960s, the judicial\nsystem was resolving challenges to anti-evolution stat-utes, which made it criminal\nto teach evolution is schools.\nSeveral other states, including Ohio and Tennessee, have\nrecently sought to force the\nteaching of creationism is\nschools, but these have been\nrepeatedly struck down by\nthe US Supreme Court as\nunconstitutional. In 1987, the\nUS Supreme Court ruled that\ncreationism was a religious\nbelief that could not be taught\nin state schools along with\nevolution.\nIn this age, people should\nbe permitted to learn science\nunadulterated by religious\ndoctrine. The American Civil\nLiberties Union is to be commended for its vigilance in\nthis and other cases. The scientific community certainly\nhas a lot to be grateful for.\nChristion creationists want evolutionary theory banned\nReginald Pundit, tabloid freelancing columnist and professional after-dinner speaker,\ngives his exclusive uncensored\nviews on science.\nHuygens schm-uygens\nI\u2019m tired of reading all these liberal apologists making excuses\nfor the Huygens mission.\nSpace-turkey\nIt may have travelled over a\nbillion miles across the solar\nsystem, survived the harsh\nTitan atmosphere, landed with\npin-point cruise missile accura-cy, and expanded the frontiers\nof space exploration, but let\u2019s\nface it...\nThe pictures were rubbish.\nThey were so bad that at first\nESA mission control thought\nthey had taken the wrong\nturn at Jupiter and landed on\nMars.\nHow a $2 billion dollar mission can\u2019t afford to hook up\na decent digital camera is\nbeyond me.\nThey do digital at Dixons for\n\u00a332 nowadays: no excuse.\nAnd to these people who say\nthat the mission will reveal conditions on a primitive earth, I\nsay...\nSurely if they spent the billions on time travel (something\nI have always advocated) they\nwould have found the answer\nmore easily.\n65 yr old Romanian\npensioner gives birth\nIt\u2019s a testament to the sick\nand twisted minds of GM scientists that they decided to\nimplant a cow embryo in the\nold Romanian woman in the\nfirst place.\nHorror\nIt\u2019s not funny and not clever\nand I might add that despite\nbeing a staunch advocate of\nGM crops (and consumer, I\nmight add) I have to stand by\nmy guns and say:\nThis GM train has careered\noff the rails.

Becky can rely only on her wit,\nguile and sexuality as she makes\nher way up through London soci-ety. She leaves school with her best\nfriend Amelia \u2013 a stupidly optimistic creature who was Thackeray\u2019s\nparody of good-girl heroines \u2013 and\nfinds employment as governess to\nthe daughters of Sir Pitt Crawley\nwhilst befriending Crawley\u2019s moneybag dowager aunt Matilda, who\neventually invites her to London.\nMatilda is outraged when Becky\nsecretly marries her favourite and\nrather dashing nephew Rawdon\n\u2013 a soldier, a gambler, and as good\na match for Becky as can be imag-ined. Naturally, she treats him like\ndirt. Aunt Matilda cuts off all social\nand financial ties with the newly-weds, forcing them to find other\nways of financing Becky\u2019s needs.\nThis starts off with gambling to pay\noff the somewhat persistent bailiffs\nbut eventually leads to Becky getting\ninvolved with a rather slimy Steyne\n(Gabriel Byrne), whose assistance\ncomes at a higher cost than she\nanticipated.\nIf you haven\u2019t read Thackeray\u2019s\nVanity Fair, and let\u2019s be honest,\nmost people here haven\u2019t (includ-ing me), Mira Nair\u2019s new film version will probably pass as a reasonable approximation with a pleasant\nenough ending.\nHowever, there is a problem:\nThackeray wasn\u2019t interested in\nbeing pleasant. \u201cI want to leave everybody dissatisfied and unhappy at\nthe end of the story,\u201d he once said\nabout his cynical bestseller.\nWhat the book has is a great anti-heroine: Becky Sharp, the amoral,\ntwo-faced social butterfly who climbs\nthe ladder until she gets the money\nand position she craves. It\u2019s a great\npart for Reese Witherspoon, who\nproved she could play a soulless and\nmesmerizing female as Tracy Flick,\nthe conniving high school student of\n1999\u2019s Election. She was chillingly\nconniving in that film. If Witherspoon\nhad tapped into Flick\u2019s ruthlessness\nwe might have had something here.\nIt\u2019s a huge disappointment, then,\nthat Witherspoon and the director\nhave neutered Becky Sharp. Becky\nhas been changed into a shrewd,\nsomewhat misguided, essentially\nsympathetic heroine. She has been\nmade lovable -- and a Vanity Fair\nwith a lovable Becky Sharp has no\nreason to exist.\nWitherspoon gets the accent and\nthe bearing reasonably right, but\neverything else is missing. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong here \u2013 I don\u2019t think\nthis is her fault, she\u2019s actually very\ngood but it\u2019s difficult to condense\na 900 page book into a two hour\nfilm. All the attention seems to have\nbeen lavished on the lush settings\nand perfect costumes, while details\nof character and plot development\nseem to have been overlooked.\nByrne (the slimeball) is particularly impressive, as is Eileen Atkins\nas Aunt Matilda, who must have\nhad the best one liners of the whole\nfilm. Although James Purefoy gives\na good account of Becky\u2019s dreamy\nhusband, the other suitors are less\nimpressive. Rhys Ifans\u2019 well-mean-ing Dobbin gets stranded with a\ndreadful line towards the end of the\nfilm after he decides to return from\nhis trip to India. I can\u2019t really explain\nit but it is so shockingly bad that it\u2019s\nvery funny.\nWhile Nair can\u2019t be accused of\ndelivering a conventional corset\ndrama, fans of the novel will feel\nthe film is a rather cheap appreciation of Thackeray\u2019s tale, particularly\ngiven the skilful way she handled\nthe human complexities in her previous film, Monsoon Wedding. Nair\nglosses over the intricacies of the\nstory with sumptuous visual flourishes that might be expected after\nwatching her last film, which was\ntruly gorgeous.\nThe result is a social satire without\nany bite, but don\u2019t let that put you\noff. It\u2019s still worth seeing for the one\nliners, the visuals and the extremely\ndashing Rawdon Crawley.\nBollywood meets old England\nHaj Alttahir sees director Mira Nair and star Reese Witherspoon fail to impress in the\nadaptation of Thackeray\u2019s classic novel\nVanity Fair\nDirector: Mira Nair\nStarring: Reese Witherspoon,\nJonathan Rhys-Meyers, Gabriel Byrne\nLength: 141 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHII\nReese Witherspoon as a strangely lovable Becky Sharp\n\u201cThe result is a\nsocial satire without\nany bite, but don\u2019t\nlet that put you off\u201d\nElektra comp\nAs part of the build-up for the\nrelease of Elektra (21 January),\n20th Century Fox have generously\nprovided you with the opportnity\nto win two goodie bags (contain-ing a sleek armband, ladies\u2019 Tshirt, smart key chain and single\nstrap rucksack), as well as two\nt-shirts and two keychains for\nrunners-up.\nAll you need to do to win is be\none of the first to tell me:\nIn what movie did Elektra first\nmake her big screen debut?\nEmail your answer to film.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk.

Last Friday,\nafter a seven year, two billion kilometre journey, the\nEuropean Space Agency\nprobe Huygens descended to\nthe surface of Titan, beaming back pictures and data as\nit went. The scientists gathered at mission control in\nDarmstadt, Germany, for the\ndescent were ecstatic with\nthe success, but are likely to\nbe puzzling over the results\nfor years to come.\nIn the lead up to the land-ing, some scientists made\nbold predictions about the\nnature of what would be found\nat Titan. John Zarnecki, who\nheads the Open University\nteam that built Hugens\u2019s surface science package, predicted the presence of weather on Titan with clouds, rain\nand even oceans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much too cold for a\nwater based weather system\nto exist, but the temperature\nis right for simple hydrocarbons thought to be present\nin the atmosphere, such as\nmethane and ethane, to cycle\nbetween gas and liquid.\u201d\nLast October, infra-red and\nradar imaging equipment on\nthe Saturn orbitor Cassini\npenetrated the thick cloud\nthat surrounds Titan for the\nfirst time, finally revealing\nthe moon\u2019s surface. But these\nimages proved to be more\npuzzling than informative.\nThe surface clearly had features \u2013 light and dark regions\nwith sharp boundaries \u2013 but\nwhat were they? Marty\nTomasko, head of imaging on\nthe Huygens mission would\nnot speculate at the time, but\nnoted that the lack of specu-lar glare (basically glinting\nsunlight), suggested there\nwas no ocean.\nThe pictures taken by\nHuygens during its descent to\nthe surface at first seem more\npromising. One image, taken\nfrom 16 km above the surface\nseems to show streams flowing to a coastline. A panoramic view stitched together\nfrom pictures taken at 8km\nis dominated by an almost\nfeatureless dark area dotted\nwith low clouds, at the edge of\nwhich appears to be a coast-line. Could this be Zarnecki\u2019s\npredicted ocean?\nMission scientists are cautious about such interpreta-tions. Marty Tomasko notes:\n\u201cYou have to be careful,\nbecause we\u2019re biased by the\nthings we see on Earth.\u201d\nTomasko suspects that\nHuygens landed in the dark\nregion. If he is correct then\n\u201csea\u201d may not be the best\nanalogy for this region.\nUnder the probe was a\ndevice called a penetrom-eter, designed to measure\nthe force of the impact as\nHuygens hit the surface at\n10 mph. The results beamed\nback from this instrument\nsuggest a hard crust that\ncracked on impact to reveal\na soft layer, \u201csomething like\ncr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e\u201d, says Andrew\nBall of the Open University,\na colleague of Zarnecki\u2019s on\nthe Huygens surface science\nteam. The landing site also\ncontains scattered small\nrocks, possibly of ice, that\nappear to be weathered.\nWhiletheregionofHuygen\u2019s\nlanding site does not appear\nto be a \u2018sea\u2019, it may well\nbe a reservoir of methane:\nHuygens\u2019 mass spectrometer\n(chemical analyser) detected\nmethane evaporating from\nTitan\u2019s surface at the landing\nsite. It also recorded ethane,\nacetylene and other complex\nhydrocarbon molecules.\nThe evaporation fits with\nZarnecki\u2019s prediction of a\nsimple hydrocarbon based\nweather system, as does the\npresence of low clouds or\nground fog and of stream or\nriver type features. Unlike\nthe barren deserts of Mars,\nTitan seems to be quite a\ndynamic place.\nIt could be dynamic in other\nways besides having weather.\nMany scientists believe that\nTitan\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 a mix of\nNitrogen and simple hydrocarbons \u2013 is similar to the\npresent on the early earth.\nPerhaps the most scientifically exciting question for the\nHuygens mission is whether\nnatural chemical processes\non Titan could produce the\ncomplex hydrocarbons that\nare the building blocks of life\nas we know it. Data from the\nmass spectrometer, being\nanalysed right now, should\nbe able to tell us the answer\nsoon.\nThe surface is too cold for\nlife as we know it (around\n\u2013180\u00baC), but some scientists,\nincluding Open University\nAstrobiologist Barrie Jones,\nhave speculated that some\nform of geothermal energy\non Titan could warm things\nup enough for life.\nDigital processing more\ncareful assembly of individual\nimages into mosaics should\nsoon give us better pictures\nof Titan\u2019s surface. The spectra of light reflected from\nsurface will give clues more\nclues about the chemical\ncomposition of the surface.\nOne thing is certain, scientists will be analysing\nHuygens\u2019 data for years to\ncome as they try to unlock\nTitan\u2019s secrets.\nA surface strewn with perhaps rocks or blocks of ice (left), channels flowing into a coastline (top right), and clouds and the edge of a coastline seen at 8km altitude (bottom right)\nNews\nin brief\nOxford science\ncentre to probe\nmysteries of the\nmind\nCan there be a predisposition for fundamentalism?

But last\nweek things suddenly turned\nsour, when a top expert questioned the validity of the findings in a national newspaper.\nNature published their\nanalysis of the 13,000 year old\nbones last October, which was\nhailed as the most important\ndiscovery in paleoanthropology of the last 150 years. The\nteam claimed that the bones\nwere that of a new human\nspecies: Homo floresiensis.\nThey described her as a one\nmetre tall, 25 year old, intelligent female, descendent of\nour long-extinct ancestor. But\nin The Guardian last week\ncritics questioned her sex,\nand, most significantly, that\nthis was not a new species\nat all, but a pygmy version\nof Homo sapiens with a common brain disease.\nProfessor Teuka Jacob from\nGadjah Mada University in\nYogakarta, Indonesia is one of\nthe world\u2019s most experienced\npaleoanthropologists. He told\nThe Guardian that \u201cThere\nis plenty of other evidence of\npygmy peoples in the region.\nThere are pygmies still living\nin west Papua, the Andaman\nand Nicobar islands, and in\nthe Philippines. But they are\nall Homo sapiens. They\u2019re\njust a smaller size. These pygmies were once quite normal\ncommon, but only pockets\nremain. There was far more\ndiversity of people before.\u201d\nHe explains the unusually\nsmall brain volume of the\nskeleton as a result of mental\nabnormalities caused by the\ndisease microcephaly.\nBut the plot thickens. Jacob\nhas Flores Hominid locked in\na steel vault. The Australian\nco-author of the original\npaper, Professor Richard\nRoberts, has accused Jacob\nof stifling the study by holding onto the bones. This is an\naccusation Jacob vehemently\ndenies. Co-author Professor\nPeter Brown said that Jacob\nhas a reputation for holding onto materials and not\nallowing other people access.\nJacob rejects these charges\nand accuses the Australian\nteam of unethical behaviour\nand inexperience, and says\nthat the referees of the Nature\narticle were one-sided.\nCambridge biological\nanthropologist Dr Jay Stock\ntold Felix that the Nature article was \u201crigorously reviewed\nby six top palaeontologists.\u201d\nHe does not think that\nJacob\u2019s accusations stand.\nStock could not confirm the\ndetails of the stand-off over\npossession of the bones. He\nfeels that Jacob\u2019s comments\nto The Guardian have damaged the reputation of pal-aeontology, because his criticisms should have been published in an academic journal\nwhere referees can check the\nevidence before it is made\npublic. He continues: \u201cJacob\ndoes a disservice to human\npalaeontology and studies of\nhuman evolution by raising\nthese disagreements pub-licly. It undermines the science that we agree on.\u201d The\nuncertainty over the Flores\nHominid discovery has led\nMuslim and Christian creationists to use Jacob\u2019s comments as evidence against\nevolution.\nAn underlying argument\nfuels the dispute: where did\nmodern Homo sapiens evolve,\nin Africa or in a number of\nplaces scattered around the\nworld? If Homo florensiensis\nis another species of human,\nit would undermine the multi-region theory.\nStock told Felix that the\nnext step is to look at Flores\nHominid\u2019s DNA, to try to\nresolve whether it is a new\nspecies of human. He said:\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if samples were\ntaken before the skeleton was\ntaken by Jacob.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEW\nThe music press is fickle. In 2003,\nyou couldn\u2019t move for articles praising French duo M83\u2019s second record,\nthe gloriously OTT Dead Cities, Red\nSeas And Lost Ghosts, using adjectives like \u2018superlative\u2019, \u2018emotive\u2019,\nand (my favourite) \u2018transcendent\u2019.\nThe mixture of cheap-sounding yet\nexpensive synthesizers and drum\nmachines, making desolate but\norganic-sounding soundscapes,\nseemed to defy comparison or\nexplanation. So, flushed with their\nsuccess, our Gallic chums retreated\nto their studio to record this, the\nfollow-up. Unfortunately, the music\npress has long since recovered from\nits infatuation with their brand of\nprog-electro, resulting in a general\nhalf-hearted panning of the album.\nSo, is it as good as Dead Cities...\nis? Yes, but in a different way.\nDon\u2019t Save Us From The Flames\nis a classic example of punked-up\nM83 at work; pleasant female harmonies drift over furious drums,\nunderpinned by some thunderous\nguitar-as-synth attack. There\u2019s a\ndistinct eighties feel to the track that\nM83 have never exhibited before;\nsomething in the way the synthesisers and guitars overlap. They\u2019ve\nalso discovered the concept of massive choruses, as demonstrated by\nthe wonderfully titled Teen Angst.\nGorgeous arpeggios of keyboards\nand stilted, barely understandable\nvocals cascade into walls of strings\nand utterly enveloping, wordless\nvocal harmonies offset against a\ncheap, skittering drum machine. I\nhave absolutely no idea what they\u2019re\nsinging about, but it\u2019s truly moving.\nAsterisk is reminiscent of America\nfrom Dead Cities..., the huge electro\nbasslines and synthesised strings\nnow combining with a much more\nupfront use of guitars. When you\nleast expect it, the track drops back\nto the menacing bassline, before\nlurching back into the main riff.\n\u2018Lurching\u2019 is perhaps the wrong\nword, since the most frightening\nthing about it is the precision with\nwhich the noise is unleashed.\nAs with Dead Cities\u2026, at least half\nthe album is made up of meander-ing, layered songs that seem to build\nand build until there\u2019s little room\nto breathe in the sound. Whereas\nthese would previously drift on for\nsix minutes plus, most of them clock\nin at under four minutes. This newfound brevity is both a blessing and\na curse; whereas it seemed that the\nsongs would often run short of ideas\nwell shy of the end (bar the sublime\nBeauties Must Die), now you almost\nwill them to continue and explore.\nA prime example is I Guess I\u2019m\nFloating, with its gentle keyboard\nprogression that cries out to be built\nup and built up. Instead, it\u2019s merely\nfaded out two minutes in.\nCar Chase Terror harks back\nto M83\u2019s debut with its extensive\nuse of sampling; crickets and passing traffic provide a backing for a\ntruly disturbing roadside dialogue\nbetween a mother and her daughter\nabout a demonic stalker. As the girl\npleads \u201cTurn the key, go, go!\u201d walls\nof synths and double-time drums\ncreate a sense of desperation, of\npanic, that aims (and succeeds) to\ninstil the same fear in the listener.\nI\u2019ve mentioned the things that\nmake this album great, but one song\nreally defiled my enjoyment of it.\nThe offender, Can\u2019t Stop, is almost\nunredeemable, sounding like a poor\nBee Gees pastiche that destroys the\notherwise perfect first half of the\nalbum. Whatever possessed them to\nrepeatedly sing, in Chipmunk voic-es, \u201cI can\u2019t stop, yeah\u201d for more than\ntwo minutes eludes me. Perhaps a\nhuge dose of LSD is to blame. Thank\nyour chosen deity for programmable\nCD players, eh? I advise you to simply skip it, and never ever listen to\nit. You\u2019ll save yourself the pain of a\nsingle song spoiling this otherwise\ngreat album.\nFile under:\nMind-expanding electronica\nIf you like this, try:\nMy Bloody Valentine \u2013 Loveless\nMusic is back!\nAndrew Sykes ushers in the new year with a suitably futuristic release from your new\nfavourite French electro-prog duo, M83\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005\n12\nM83\nBefore The Dawn Heals Us\n(Gooom Records)\nHHHHI\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nM83: French, progressive, and named after a distant galaxy. Pretentious, moi?\nThe break-up of The Smiths far behind him, and his partnership with Johnny Marr long\nforgotten, Morrissey brings his live show to the stadiums of old England\nLIVE REVIEW\nThe return of Stephen Patrick\nMorrissey to the music world from\nhis self-imposed exile in Los Angeles\nwas quite possibly the musical highlight of 2004.\nWith the release of the album\nYou Are The Quarry, arguably his\nbest work since the break up of his\nband The Smiths in 1987, Morrissey\ntook aim at his critics, who \u201chad\nmy face dragged in fifteen miles of\ns***\u201d, and fired with deadly accu-racy. Depending on your personal\nopinion, the enigmatic Mancunian\nis often called either \u2018the Pope of\nmope\u2019 or \u2018golden-voice\u2019. On the evidence of his recent material and\nthis gig at Earl\u2019s Court, I am more\ninclined to refer to him by the\nlatter.\nTonight, \u2018golden-voice\u2019 would\nhave silenced any nay-sayers in the\narena. He opened with the bombastic How Soon Is Now?, a 1984\nSmiths classic, sounding as fresh as\nthe day it was made, with the more\nhard-edged Boz Boorer replacing the original swampy sound of\nJohnny Marr\u2019s guitar solo. He followed this with First Of The Gang\nTo Die, the story of gang memeber\nHector\u2019s cruel death to \u2018a bullet in\nhis gullet\u2019.\nOther highlights included the single Let Me Kiss You, and the two classics from the legendary 1986 album\nThe Queen Is Dead of Bigmouth\nStrikes Again and There Is A Light\nThat Never Goes Out, where he\nsings \u201cIf a ten ton truck kills the\nboth of us, to die by your side, well,\nthe pleasure and the privilege is\nmine.\u201d Morrissey, affectionately\nknown as Mozzer, can be completely\nunlikable and at the same time compellingly charismatic, charming and\nmalicious in one sentence. Tonight\nwas no exception.\nMany of the later tracks saw\nMorrissey in his usual beliger-ent mood. Soon after lambasting\n\u201clockjawed popstars, thicker than\npig-s***\u201d in The World Is Full Of\nCrashing Bores, he takes a shot\nat Labour and the Tories in Irish\nBlood, English Heart, and at his critics in You Know I Couldn\u2019t Last. One\naspect of Mozzer\u2019s music is that, if\nhe isn\u2019t brilliantly laying into one of\nhis enemies, he pontificates on his\nlonely, asexual lifestyle \u2013 one that\nmany of his fans seem to relate to. In\nI Have Forgiven Jesus, Moz blames\nChrist for giving him \u201cSo much love\nin a loveless world\u201d.\nHe finished the night with a Smiths\ntear-jerker, Last Night I Dreamt\nThat Somebody Loved Me, which\npretty well speaks for itself but was\nmoving mostly because of the beautiful keyboard solo at the end.\nDespite the appalling arena, this\ngig was sheer adrenaline. Even in\nmy spot, which seemed so far away I\nmay as well have been in South Ken,\nthe band\u2019s electrifying performance\ncombined with Mozzer\u2019s primal\nnorthern vocals had everyone disappointed that it didn\u2019t go on longer.\nA question posed in Morrissey\u2019s\n1990 hit Piccadilly Palace was \u201cWhy\ndo you smile when you think about\nEarl\u2019s Court?\u201d Following this per-formance, I had plenty of reasons.\nAndrew Sykes\nMusic Editor\nMorrissey\nEarls Court\nHHHHI\nMorrissey: boy in da corner\n\n"

So, reluctantly, they\nmade their way to the Virgin\ntrain. With 30 seconds left\nuntil departure, a rather calm\nGeorge had hopped on and\nstarted walking down the car-riage. His estimate of getting\nacross London in 40 minutes\non a Friday at rush hour was\na little unrealistic!\nFinally at the destination\non the Warwick campus,\nDD headed straight for \u201cthe\nbar\u201d. No really, that was the\nname! At least there was no\nconfusion as to what kind\nof things happened on the\npremises. DD took a trip to\nthe union where they ripped\nup the dance floor, showing\nthe Warwick students how to\ndance, Doctors style! After\nan hour or so of dancing and\ndrinks, the guys left to sleep\non a kitchen floor. Luxury!\nWaking up only about four\nhours later, DD headed over\nto the sports hall, there of\ncourse to run around and play\nsome indoor Ultimate!\nAngels 7\nDisc Doctors 1\nAngels were a team from\nBrixton, London, yet we\nended up travelling 100 miles\nfrom home in order to play\nthem!\nThe fellow Londoners, who\nwere seeded second in group\nC, set the day\u2019s standard\nby throwing a zone. It only\ntook a single mistake from\nDD for Angels to capitalise\nand score. A change of tactics\nbroke up the zone, allowing\nStas to score the first point\nfor Disc Doctors.\nAlthough DD were 5\u20131\ndown, they didn\u2019t give up\nthe fight and kept up a great\ndeal of pressure during the\n7th Angels\u2019 point. The point\nlasted for a long time, wearing down both teams and\ncausing Angels to throw away\na lot of discs.\nThis was a tough first game,\nas was apparent from the\nlarge number of people staggering off the pitch at the\nend.\nDisc Doctors 3\nBears 3 2\nThe next game was against\nBears Thirds. Home support\ncan become a little over-whelming, but DD kept their\ncool, gaining many of the\nturnovers by forcing Bears to\nmake mistakes.\nIt didn\u2019t take the home side\nlong to get their rhythm back,\nscoring two points against\nDD. But Imperial turned the\nscoring around quicker than\nGeorge W could rig the US\nelection.\nThe pace picked up with\nall the players having to run\nhard to keep up with their\nmarks. Doctors scored a point\nand Munky caught two great\npasses from Stylish, both of\nwhich were outside of the\nblue lines! It really didn\u2019t help\nthat the sidelines blended in\nquite nicely with the blue colour of the sports hall floor.\nDetermined not to step\nout for the third time in a\nrow, Munky stood in the end-zone, reaching out to score\nDD\u2019s second. The tight\nscore elevated tension, and\nthe shouting on pitch was\nimmense, but this didn\u2019t stop\nthe Doctors increasing their\nscore to three points. With\nthe seconds disappearing like\nan open packet of crisps in\nthe pub, Finnish and Stylish\nthwarted the Bears\u2019 last-ditch overhead attempt. Disc\nDoctors had won the game,\nand a very close one at that!\nRed 11\nDisc Doctors 2\nEven before DD were on the\npitch, the Red team looked\nvery experienced, a characteristic that was only emphasised by their third place\nseeding.\nOn the pitch, they were better than on paper, making\nscoring look like child\u2019s play.\nThe determined Disc Doctors\npicked up the pace, pushing\nto subdue the Red guys who\nwere always one step ahead.\nJust when it looked as\nthough one of Red\u2019s better\npositioned players would\nget Stylish\u2019s overhead, Stas\nreached that tiny bit further,\nbeating his mark to score\nDD\u2019s first point.\nInthelastminute,observers\nwatched as three overhead\nattempts were intercepted by\nplayers, one of which involved\nStylish admirably prising the\ndisc out of the air, sandwiched\nbetween two Red players.\nBoth teams had a fantastic game, which fortunately\nended in time for everyone\nto head over to \u201cthe bar\u201d to\nwatch the football!\nWhiplash 12\nDisc Doctors 2\nIt was apparent from the\nprevious game that the Disc\nDoctors didn\u2019t have a foolproof plan to eliminate cheeky\noverhead passes and, as Red\nhad picked up on this, so did\nWhiplash.\nThey sent direct passes to\ntheir players in the corners\nof the endzone, who caught\nthem with minimal fuss. As\nWhiplash went ahead, Disc\nDoctors struggled with\norganisation, allowing a few\nsilly points to be scored. The\nlack of good cuts from DD\nplayers made it a little hard\nfor the DD handlers, but the\nguys still managed to score\ntwo points.\nThe game ended with Disc\nDoctors in need of medical\ntreatment caused by a good\nwhipping! Nevertheless it\nwas worth playing the team.\nAirwolf 9\nDisc Doctors 5\nThe crossover game of the\nday, which could have pulled\nDD out of the bottom group,\nwas against the Ironman\nteam (a team without substi-tutes), Airwolf.\nUnfortunately, DD were on\na bit of a low from the last two\ngames, but as the Ironmen\ngot worn down, DD got more\nenthusiastic as more and\nmore chances came their\nway. Play was aggressive but\nsafe and even included the\nodd ambitious throw.\nAs DD came back, Stylish\nthrew an overhead pass with\ntensecondsontheclock,which\nwas magnificently caught by\nMatt right in the corner of the\nendzone. Although they had\nbeen beaten, DD were still\npleased with their monster\ncomeback. Hats off to Airwolf,\nwho looked truly knackered!\nThe Party\nAs the games finished, the\nwhole team began to focus\non party aspect of the tour-nament. Being a fun tourna-ment, everyone could let loose\nand party to the early hours!\nThe guys went for plenty of\nfood and drink to make up\nfor the energy exerted during\nthe day.\nIt was Boogie Nights at the\nunion, with the DJ spinning\nup some classic disco/funk\nfor the masses. The place\nwas buzzing with more people than a night at LSE on a\nFriday, but due to the tremendous size of the union there\nwas loads of space to sit and\nchill.\nIn ultimate style, Stas and\nContinued on page 23\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nThe Disc Doctors: thankfully they were indoors this time\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\n414. Every hardcore hard dance fan\nin the city should know these three\ndigits. For those that don\u2019t, the 414\nis an absolute gem of a club \u2013 situated at number 414 Coldharbour\nLane, Brixton, for over a decade\nit\u2019s been supplying the nocturnal\nhordes with just what they want\n\u2013 pumping, pounding, bouncy music,\nall weekend.\nThe place is tiny, holding a couple\nof hundred at the most, and consists of downstairs, with bar and\nthe dancefloor, and upstairs (via a\nnarrow, twisty iron staircase) which\nserves as a chillout area. There\u2019s no\nmusic upstairs \u2013 the relentless thudding of the music from beneath is\nplenty. There are, however, a snack\nbar serving teas, coffees, pot noodles and the like, a projector screen,\na fish tank, and giant Connect 4.\nThe music policy is simple \u2013 hard.\nHard house, hard trance, and \u2018NuNRG\u2019 are some of the names for this\nkind of sound. Solid four-to-the-floor\nbeats at a giddy speed, plus more\ndrones, horns and hoover sounds\nthan you can shake a glow stick at.\nThe place is open for the majority\nof the weekend: Friday, Saturday\nand Sunday from 10pm to 6am, and\nafterparties on Saturday and Sunday\nfrom 6.30am until 2pm. Come here\nany time and you will find more\nor less the same thing \u2013 banging\ntunes, and a wild and eclectic crowd\nof revellers to bounce alongside or\nchat to.\nWith all this in mind and after an\nuneventful weekend, plus the added\nbonus of no lectures on Monday, I\nwent down to check out Just Groove,\n414\u2019s regular Sunday night party.\nThe first question that might\nspring to mind is: who the hell goes\nto a hard house club on a Sunday\nnight? Well, me for a start. The rest\nof the crowd is made up of those\nlooking for somewhere to stomp out\nthe dying hours of their all-weekend\nsession, and, well, randoms. There\nis always a nice mixture of people\n\u2013 I had a nice chat to a Greek guy in\nhis fifties (wearing a tweed jacket)\nwho\u2019s been coming here since it\nopened.\n\u201cSo you like hard house then?\u201d I\nasked, half rhetorically. The grin and\ndefinite nod said it all. Later I saw\nthis chap bouncing around the club,\ngiving it just as much oomph as\nanyone else. My point\u2019s not that this\nguy stuck out, quite the opposite. In\nclubs like this, anything goes and\nall are welcome, especially in somewhere this cosy. The only thing people would object to is pretension, if\nthere was any. Instead, the attitude\nhere is spot on \u2013 give it some on the\ndance floor, or hang about upstairs\nand have a cup of tea, a chat, and a\ncouple of rounds of giant Connect 4.\nOn the floor was where I spent\nmost of the night, enjoying the wonderful sounds of DJs Skol, Muzz\nand Roosta. These guys have been\nresidents here for at least as long\nas I\u2019ve been coming, which in itself\nspeaks volumes. To be consistently\ndelivering the goods to the beat-hungry whilst helping the club go\nfrom strength to strength year after\nyear, these guys are most definitely\ndoing a lot of things right. As the\nnight rolled on, so the music intensi-fied. Needless to say I couldn\u2019t move\nmy body fast enough, with the music\npushing me on with electric, acid-tinged sounds and breakdowns that\nbuild with a million snares until they\npeak, offering a moment\u2019s respite for\nthe crowd before the beat returns to\nhammer them some more.\nA couple of the tracks I can pick\nout were a super-energised mix of\nMembers of Mayday\u2019s happy house\nanthem 10 in 01 and a remix of\nPure White\u2019s classic hardcore track\n4am (which itself sampled Beverly\nCraven\u2019s Promise Me).\nThe club was by no means full\ntonight, but that didn\u2019t matter. The\nplace is so small that it never feels\nempty, and with only 50 or 60 people\nthere you will see, if not speak to\nmost of them, and everyone here is\ngenuine and friendly. The bar staff\nare cute and fun, too. I did leave with\na bit of ringing in my ears, so next\ntime I\u2019ll remember my ear plugs.\nOver all the time I\u2019ve been coming here, the 414 has changed a\nbit, but it\u2019s still got all of its charm\nand character. Upstairs used to be\nbare, cold and dirty \u2013 now there\u2019s\na carpet, the windows are properly\nblocked and there are some nice\nfairy lights to complement the UV\nmurals. The spiral staircase itself\nis decorated with more fairy lights,\nand around the dance floor there\u2019s\nmore UV-active decoration. The vibe\nremains.\nSo, if you\u2019re ever looking for something a bit harder, or if you\u2019ve been\nout and don\u2019t want to go home, I\u2019d\nrecommend you pay a visit. If you\ncan make it for Just Groove it\u2019s well\nworth it for the novelty of clubbing\non a Sunday alone \u2013 it\u2019s a great way\nto start your week.\nSimon Clark\nNightlife Editor\nThe best way to start your week\nLondon is full of hidden treasures.

    "content": "Can animals predict the occurrence of natural disasters? Sonja van Renssen looks at the\nevidence of and potential use for the natural world\u2019s awareness of imminent events\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005\n4\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhy did a tsunami that killed\nmore than 150,000 people\nharm no more than a handful\nof animals?\nOver the last few weeks,\nwe have been bombarded\nwith terrible images of chaos,\ndestruction and death. The\ncost in human lives has been\nmade brutally clear. Yet wildlife officials in Sri Lanka,\nwhere more than 30,000 people have been reported dead\nso far, insist that there have\nbeen no recorded animal\ndeaths. Similar reports are\nappearing from other devastated areas and one cannot help but wonder: where\nwere they all when disaster\nstruck?\nAs anecdotal evidence\nemerges of unusual animal behaviour prior to the\ncatastrophe, the debate over\nwhether animals can sense\nimpending disaster and flee\nfrom it has resurfaced with a\nvengeance.\nThe roots of this debate\nstretch back to ancient\nGreece. In 373BC, historians\nrecorded that animals including rats, snakes and weasels\ndeserted the Greek city of\nHelice en masse just days\nbefore it was destroyed by\nan earthquake and tsunami.\nTales of animal behaviour\nthat appears to anticipate disaster have surfaced across\nthe centuries ever since.\nIn spite of this wealth of\nanecdotal evidence, however,\nthe majority of the scientific\ncommunity does not recognise a link between animal\nbehaviour and earthquakes.\nThe United States Geological\nSurvey (USGS) says on its\nwebsite:\n\u201cChanges in animal behavior cannot be used to predict\nearthquakes. Even though\nthere have been documented cases of unusual animal\nbehaviorpriortoearthquakes,\na reproducible connection\nbetween a specific behaviour and the occurrence of\nan earthquake has not been\nmade.\u201d\nIn the recent press coverage of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, Andy Michael,\na geophysicist at USGS, was\nquoted as saying: \u201cWhat\nwe\u2019re faced with is a lot of\nanecdotes. Animals react to\nso many things \u2013 being hun-gry, defending their territo-ries, mating, predators \u2013 so\nit\u2019s hard to have a controlled\nstudy to get that advanced\nwarning signal.\u201d\nTrue, but this did not stop\nthe USGS from attempting\nan extensive series of these\nstudies in the late 1970s.\nThe trigger for this flurry of\nactivity was what has probably become the most famous\nexample of alleged animal\nactivity prior to an earthquake in modern history.\nOn 4 February 1975, Chinese\nauthorities successfully evacuated Haicheng, a city with\none million people, just days\nbefore a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck (the Indian\nOcean tsunami was caused\nby an 8.9-magnitude earth-quake). They claimed that\ntheir decision to evacuate\nwas based in part on observations of animal behaviour.\nThe ensuing excitement at\nUSGS was further boosted in\n1977 when researchers found\nthat 50% of local people surveyed after an earthquake in\nCalifornia had noticed unusual behaviour in their pets\nprior to the event. The impossible suddenly seemed pos-sible.\nBut it was followed by dis-appointment. The California\nfindings were not deemed to\nmerit further action and it\nemerged that the Chinese\nhad neglected to mention a\nrare series of smaller quakes\nthat had occurred in the area\nbefore the big one. The USGS\nceased all research into a\npossible link between animal\nbehaviour and earthquakes\nin 1980.\nChina did not, and nor did\nJapan. Whether because of\ntheir susceptibility to earthquakes or a philosophy that\nembraces nature, these two\ncountries have continued to\nresearch animal behaviour as\na possible earthquake prediction tool. They have had false\nalarms, of course, but they\nhave had successes too.\nContinued research in the\nFar East led to the headline-grabbing news in September\n2003 that a Japanese medical doctor had conducted a\nstudy which demonstrated\nthat erratic behaviour in dogs\ncould be used to forecast\nearthquakes.\nThe study was contentious\n\u2013 The Guardian was at pains\nto point out that it was \u201ceven\nbeing regarded with caution\nin Japan\u201d \u2013 but its reporting here reflects the continued allure of believing that\nanimals have some kind of\nsixth sense to warn them of\nimpending danger, even in\nthe absence of scientific evi-dence.\nThe USGS is correct in\nsaying that \u201ca reproducible\nconnection between a specific behaviour and the occurrence of an earthquake has\nnot been made\u201d. However,\njust because there is no way\nof explaining something does\nnot mean that something\ndoes not exist. The Chinese\nhave taken this view in their\nconstruction of a network\nof experimental stations to\ncollect and analyse animal\nbehaviour observations.\nWhere Western geologists\nand seismologists have been\nreluctant to entertain the\nnotion of animal behaviour\nas a predictive tool, biologists and behaviourists have\nproposed various theories\nto explain how animals may\nsense earthquakes seemingly\nbefore they happen.\nRather than postulating\nthe existence of a mysterious\nsixth sense, the majority of\nthese theories draw on animals\u2019 highly evolved existing\nsensory apparatus to make\ntheir case. Remember too\nthat animals respond to each\nother: the flight of one may\ntrigger an exodus.\nEarthquakes shake the\nground and one of the most\nobvious ways in which animals could \u2018predict\u2019 them is\nby picking up advance vibrations that are too small for us\nto feel. Many animals, ranging from rodents to elephants,\nare known to use shockwaves\nin communication.\nJoyce Poole, Director\nof the Savanna Elephant\nVocalization Project, has\nworked with African elephants for 25 years and says\nthat research on acoustic and\nseismic communication indicates that elephants could\neasily pick up vibrations generated from an earthquake-tsunami. Fellow researcher\nCaitlin O\u2019Connell-Rodwell\ndescribes how the soft skin\non the undersides of elephant\nfeet is comparable to the taut\nsurface of a drum and is similarly sensitive to the tiniest\nvibration.\nBut even if they can pick\nup vibrations that warn them\nof impending danger, how do\nthey know where to run? A\nDutch ethologist, Paul Koene,\nexplains that elephants\ninstinctively head for higher\nground when they feel threat-ened. This fits in well with\nanecdotes of Sri Lankan elephants breaking loose for the\nhills just before the tsunami\nhit.\nAn alternative theory that\nhas gained acceptance in\nrecent years is that animals\npick up on magnetic field\nchanges that occur near the\nepicentre of an earthquake.\nMany animals are known to\nuse the earth\u2019s magnetic field\nto navigate, including pigeons\nand turtles.\nA third hypothesis postulates that it is changes in\nelectric charges that alert\nanimals to a quake. Certain\nspecies of fish are known\nto be sensitive to variations\nin electric fields \u2013 the electric eel is the most obvious\nexample \u2013 and researchers\nbelieve they may pick up on\nthe electric charge variations\nin water that sometimes precede earthquakes.\nOn land, organisms may\nrespond to changes in the\npolarity and concentration of\natmospheric ions, or charged\nparticles. This could allow\nanimals to detect the air-ionising effects of radon gas,\nwhich is sometimes released\nfrom the ground before an\nearthquake.\nA piezoelectric effect has\nalso been invoked: changes\nin the pressure exerted on\ncrystals like quartz result\nin electrical charging of the\ncrystals\u2019 surfaces. This is\nbelieved to generate enough\nelectrical energy to drive\nthe creation of airborne ions\nbefore, during and after an\nearthquake. Animals may\nanticipate earthquakes much\nas they sense oncoming thun-derstorms.\nThat organisms should\nrespond to vibrations, magnetism or electrical charges\ndoes not exhaust the range of\ntheories that advocates of an\nearthquake-animal behaviour\nlink have put forward.\nMore controversial hypotheses include the idea that\nanimals react to ultrasound\nemitted by fracturing rock\nbefore an earthquake occurs.\nThis theory has been heavily\ncriticised by geologists who\nclaim that no such sound is\nemitted.\nYet the most contentious\nargument of all remains the\nidea that animals do indeed\npossess a sixth sense, something fundamentally different\nto the five senses that we currently recognise. Perhaps animals perceive and respond to\nstimuli that science at present\nsimply cannot measure.\nHere we enter the realm\nof biologists like Rupert\nSheldrake, who try to explain\nmysteries such as why dogs\nsometimes seem to anticipate\nthe arrival of their owner,\neven in the apparent absence\nof any physical signals.\nCritics will be inclined to\nmake short thrift of the sixth\nsense theory in its most literal form and will point out the\nlack of scientific evidence to\nsupport it. Nevertheless, and\nhere we return to the essence\nof the problem, critics and\nadvocates alike suffer from\nthe problem of how to conduct controlled experiments\nto test the earthquake-animal\nbehaviour hypothesis.\nEveryone agrees that there\nis an abundance of anecdotes\ndetailing unusual animal\nbehaviour prior to earthquakes and no one denies\nthat amazingly few creatures appear to have died in\nthe wake of the recent tsu-nami. Yet neither believers\nnor sceptics can realistically\nconfirm or deny a direct link\nbetween animal behaviour\nand an impending disaster.\nAs scientists, we instinctively question and search\nfor evidence. Perhaps this is\na case where we should follow the East in their simple\nacceptance of a natural phe-nomenon. This does not mean\nthat we should cease studying how animals may \u2018predict\u2019\nearthquakes; it means that\nwe should use their abilities,\neven if we do not understand\nthem, to save human lives\nwhere we can.\nThe Anthropological Survey\nof India\u2019s plan to immediately document the animal-based warning systems that\nenabled all five aboriginal\ntribes inhabiting the badly-hit\nAndaman and Nicobar islands\nto escape unscathed is a step\nin the right direction.\n\u201cIn 373BC historians\nrecorded that\nanimals deserted the\nGreek city of Helice en\nmasse just days before\nit was destroyed\u201d\nSaved by a sixth sense for the tsunami\nPrescience: do animals have an ability to predict natural disasters and ensure their\nsurvival? Can they be trained to give warnings before earthquakes?\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201c...a Japanese medical\ndoctor had conducted\na study which\ndemonstrated that\nerratic behaviour in\ndogs could be used to\npredict earthquakes\u201d\n\u201cAn alternative theory\nis that animals pick up\nmagnetic field changes\nthat occur near the\nepicentre of an\nearthquake\u201d\n\n"

There were disagreements among student representatives as to whether or\nnot rents should be based\non students\u2019 ability to pay,\nand whether or not certain\nrooms should be overpriced\nin order to make others\ncheaper.\nThe overall cost of an\nImperial education is already\nset to rise markedly for some\nstudents with the introduction of \u00a33000 \u2018top-up\u2019 tuition\nfees in 2006.\nThe College currently guarantees all first year undergraduates a place in hall.\nBy law, College Residences\nmust be self-funding. Each\nFebruary, the Head of\nResidences recommends a\nsystem of increasing rents\nby different amounts in different halls and for different types of room. This is\nsubsequently discussed by\nthe Rector\u2019s Committee on\nStudent Residences (RCSR)\nand the final decision rests\nwith the Rector.\nThe current hall application form allows students\nto express a preference for\nroom type (single, double,\ntriple, en-suite) and catered\nor self-catered, but students\ncannot choose a particular\nhall or specify a price range.\nIn recent years, rent\nincreases have been much\nhigher in the more expensive halls than in the cheaper\nones. Students living in the\nmore expensive halls, especially Beit, are subsidising\nthose living in cheaper halls\nas a result. One argument is\nthat students living in Beit\ncan afford higher increases,\nwhilst those elsewhere are\nless well off and hence can-not.\nA Beit Hall resident told\nFelix: \u201cThe system really\nneeds improving. Beit Hall\nis great but is it really worth\n\u00a3125 a week? And why should\nI pay over the odds to make\nthe cheap halls cheaper?\nWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d\nAt Tuesday\u2019s meeting of\nUnion Council, student representatives considered three\noptions.\nOption \u2018A\u2019 was to maintain\nthe status quo, but ask students to indicate the price\nrange they are prepared to\npay. Expensive halls would\ntake most of the rent rises,\nsubsidising cheaper halls.\nOption \u2018B\u2019 was to spread out\nthe rent rises more evenly,\nremoving the artificial premium for rooms in the more\nexpensive halls. Students\u2019\nability to pay would affect\ntheir rent.\nOption \u2018C\u2019 was the same as\n\u2018B\u2019 but with no link between\nrent and ability to pay.\nJust over half the Council\nexpressed an initial preference for option \u2018B\u2019. After\na lengthy discussion, a\nslightly amended version\nof this option was narrowly\ndefeated. A number of delegates supported option \u2018A\u2019.\nInterestingly, the only people\nin support of option \u2018C\u2019 were\nthe President and the Deputy\nPresident (Education and\nWelfare), who prepared the\npaper and who represent the\nUnion to the RCSR.\nSam Rorke, the Deputy\nPresident (Education and\nWelfare), said: \u201cWe had a\nuseful discussion and I look\nforward to returning to the\nissue in the future.\u201d When\nasked why he did not support a link between rents\nand ability to pay, Mr Rorke\npointed out that \u201cthere are\nalready other mechanisms\nfor students suffering financial hardship\u201d.\nSharine Brown, Head\nof Residences at Imperial\nCollege, told Felix: \u201cOur rents\ncompare favourably with\nother London universities\nand with the private sector.\u201d\nShe said that rents were likely to increase above inflation\ndue to high costs in areas\nsuch as construction, cleaning and utilities.\nFelix will bring you details\nof the RCSR\u2019s decision and\nthe finalised rent increases\nlater this term.\nTime to get a job?\nThe Careers section returns\nwith an in-depth look into\nconsultancy, featuring an\ninterview with Imperial alumnus Michael Walton who now\nruns his own consultancy\nbusiness.\nuCAREERS page 10\nLots of letters\nA full page of letters to the\neditor, covering pay prob-lems, security, exam anguish,\nBabar Ahmad and fun in\nFelix.\nuLETTERS page 9\nStarting your week\nFelix kicks off a Monday\nmorning at Brixton\u2019s 414 club,\na hidden treasure of hard\ndance.\nuNIGHTLIFE page 14\nDynamic dance\nWe savour Matthew Bourne\u2019s\nunique treatment of the classic ballet Swan Lake.\nuARTS page 15\nStudent sport\nIndoor frisbee fun for the\nDisc Doctors and champagne hockey from the medic\nThirds.\nuSPORT page 23\nTHIS WEEK\nNews page 2\nBusiness page 3\nScience page 4\nComment page 8\nCareers page 10\nAround Campus page 11\nWhat\u2019s On page 11\nMusic page 12\nNightlife page 14\nArts page 15\nFilm page 16\nCoffee Break page 22\nSport page 23\nThe Disc Doctors\nUnion divided over policy as\nhall rents rise again\nSixth sense\nCan animals predict natural\ndisasters?

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAlbum roundup\nThe Others release their middle-class baiting long-awaited debut, Feeder return from hiatus\nbut fail to impress, and Digger\u2019s done good with the new Fabric release\n13\nALBUM REVIEWS\nNow I don\u2019t think Feeder have ever\nbeen cool, but the nature of cool is\nso fickle that I am going to ignore it\nwhile listening to this album. In fact ,\nI am ignoring coolness so much I am\nwearing ankle warmers (so last sea-son) and smoking crack (so 2001).\nAnyway, back to the task in hand.\nEveryone should be aware of\nFeeder\u2019s situation: their last album\nComfort In Sound was released in\nthe wake of drummer Jon Lee\u2019s\napparent suicide. The tragedy was\nobviously hanging over the album\nas it was released quite soon after\nthe event. Reviewers didn\u2019t want to\nslag the album off in case they were\naccused of manslaughter or arrested\nfor being big meanies. This obviously hid the fact that their last album\nwas rather bland. So I bet reviewers\nare frothing at the mouth to rip into\nthis exploration of the banal known\nas Pushing The Senses.\nI genuinely wanted to like this\nalbum because I am anticipating\nthe bad reviews. However, as the CD\nended, I sighed in despair.\nIt is, for all intents and purposes,\nComfort In Sound 2, except without\nthe stadium rockers. What we are\nleft with is a mellow mess of emotions and clich\u00e9d lyrics. The closest\nwe get to something that remotely\nrocks is the title track or Pilgrim\nSoul, which is anthemic rather than\nrocking. Having said that, it still feels\nlike an overproduced Insomnia from\ntheir earlier days, with added handclaps (though not even the power of\nthe handclap can save this song).\nWhich leads me to the production;\nGil Norton, the producer of Comfort\nIn Sound, returns behind the desk.\nThis time, he\u2019s ready to insert some\n\u2018electronica\u2019 into the mix to make\nyou think their sound has advanced\neven if the songwriting hasn\u2019t. It adds\nan overproduced sheen where there\nare no new ideas, just the same idea\nfattened up. When Norton produced\nThe Pixies, the sound went from\nthe still raw Surfer Rosa sound to\nthe more palatable Doolittle sound,\nbut Franck Black and Kim Deal\u2019s\nsongwriting still retained vitality.\nGrant Nicholas\u2019 writing does have\nunderlying uplifting themes such as\nthe celebration theme in Dove Grey\nSands but they aren\u2019t communicated effectively enough to take you\nanywhere.\nBurn Pilgrim Soul off this album\nas it is Feeder at their best, driving\nwith a typical sing-along chorus. The\nponderous lethargic nature of this\nalbum is never engaging or uplifting as it intends to be with its bright\ncolour scheme (suspiciously looking\nlike the Winning Days by the Vines\nalbum cover, another unengaging\nfollow-up).\nThe singing and songwriting\nfight hard to find a message and a\nmelody to convey it with, but it all\nends up feeling laboured. It appears\nthat their energy has evaporated\nand they need a week of electric\nshock therapy whilst on Pro-Plus.\nTake, for example, their first single,\nTumble And Fall: it\u2019s not a piece\nof Anthemology 101 but a plodding\nstring-laden moan-athon. Not a good\nsign of things to come.\nMatty Hoban\nA tricky one this. You see, in my\nopinion, there is no need for this\nalbum to exist. The Others have\nalways been more about their live\nshows; I saw them at Glastonbury\nand the dedication that was shown\nby a large chunk of the crowd was\nimpressive, fans who have followed\nthem all the way. And in return,\nfront man Dominic Masters was\ndown there with them, putting his\nheart on the greasy sleeve of his\ncharity-shop suit jacket.\nThe fans are obviously very important to the band. In the past it was\ncommon practice to have their\nentire fan club on the guest list\nfor shows, so those who couldn\u2019t\nafford to could go, could. They get an\nalbum dedication: Community 853\nis named after them.\nAfter their dedicated fan base The\nOthers are probably best known\nfor their \u201cguerrilla gigging\u201d, playing with minimal announcement\nin unconventional places, namely\na Hammersmith & City tube, the\nfoyer of Radio 1, and probably your\nbedroom if you asked them. These\nare the important things about The\nOthers, their semi-mythology.\nSo, on to the music. It starts really\npromisingly, with Lackey, upbeat\nnew-wave drums and bass, with\nrazor-sharp guitars similar to Slow\nHands by Interpol. But in general you get your Libertines-esque\nurchin-rock standard backing. It\u2019s\nonly a matter of time before Pete\nDoherty starts selling backing tapes\nlike this to fuel his crack addiction.\nA strange bunch as well. The bass\nplayer\u2019s an ageing goth, the guitarist\nis a skinhead called something like\nJohnny Lager, and... well I couldn\u2019t\ntell you anything remarkable about\nthe drummer, even under threat of\nbeing force-fed the millions of copies\nof Busted\u2019s third album they\u2019ll never\nrelease (Busted RIP).\nOK then, what\u2019s the point? Why do\nthey have a fan base at all? Enter Mr\nMasters, his skinny frame and lank\nhair railing against all authority. He\ndoesn\u2019t sing, oh-no, \u2018cos that\u2019s what\nthe record company wants him to\ndo. Instead he executes a lazy drawl\nthat turns \u201cout of here\u201d to \u201cou-haere\u201d, or the track Pshychovision to\n\u201cpsah-cow-vee-shown\u201d. It came as\nno surprise that the favourite gig\nhe\u2019s been to is an Oasis concert.\nOccasional bursts of \u201cchicka-chickachick-ow!\u201d had me grinning, and\nI\u2019m sure \u201cba-ba-ba-ba-ba\u2026bow!\u201d\nhad McFly\u2019s lawyers reaching for\nthe phone. Right, so he\u2019s no Jeff\nBuckley, what else could they have\ngoing for them?\nLyrics? Well... kinda. You can see\nhow the lyrics in debut release This\nIs For The Poor could affect some\npeople: \u201cthis is for all the kids who\nstand out in the crowd, for all the\none\u2019s who\u2019ve been shoved around,\nthis is for every disappointment.\u201d\nSo is he some new-age poet, speaking for the \u201ckids\u201d, eyes open to the\nplights of the poor? No. Masters\nreally has very little to say. \u201cI want\nya to myself, I need ya more than\nanyone else\u201d from Southern Glow\n\u2026yawn. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna sell my soul\nto the man today\u201d from Lackey\n\u2026ooh not the demonic \u201cman\u201d who\npays your wages (or rather doesn\u2019t,\nyou cheeky little job-dodger).\nLines like \u201cI did acid before I did\nhash, I never wanted to sell my\nass\u201d had me pissing myself laugh-ing, but when in the otherwise taut\nand brooding Almanac he moans\n\u201cI came to London when I was 18, I\nhad no money it was only a dream\u201d\nmy iPod almost got defenestrated. I\nmean, boo-de-fucking-hoo.\nSomusicallyboring,vocallyboring,\nlyrically boring. \u201cThis is for the poor,\nnot the rich kids,\u201d rails Masters. It\nseems the \u201crich kids\u201d have bought\nthemselves the right not to listen to\na substandard Libertines support\nband. One last thing, please don\u2019t\ngive my address out to any of their\nfans, I feel they may be less than\nunderstanding...\nJames Millen\nDigweed is one of the forefathers\nof the modern dance scene. He\u2019s\nbeen successful all around the\nworld for over a decade, created\nwhat some call the first DJ mix CD,\nRenaissance, with Sasha (which has\nrecently been remastered), and he\u2019s\neven got his own show on Kiss.\nThe Fabric/Fabriclive series of\nmix CDs is now up to number 20,\nwith each mix giving a subtly different slice of the broad genre we\ncall dance music. The smart ones\namongst you will have subscribed\nto the series and received a new\nmix every month for the rather good\nprice of \u00a36.\nSo here\u2019s number 20, and given\nthe prowess of the DJ and the quality of the series so far, we\u2019re all\nexpecting it to be pure gold. The mix\nstarts gently, easing us in with soft\nrhythmic elements and a mellow\nvocal sample. The sounds develop to\nfill more and more of the sonic canvas until a solid drum beat finally\nappears after five minutes or so.\nMoving smoothly into track two,\nwith the pulse of the music building,\nthen into another within a few min-utes, the music drops into a breakdown with a simple but effective\nvocal, and when the beat comes\nback you realise how deep into the\nmix you already are. Track four, DJ\nRasoul\u2019s True Science, picks up the\npace further, with a foreboding bass\nriff then a some funky sax over the\ntop to keep things moving.\nThe next track (The Glass\u2019 Won\u2019t\nBother Me) is similarly bass-led but\nwith a more developed, funky house\nstyle riff. The next track is Billy\nDalessandro\u2019s In The Dark, which\nis dark and tribal. At the end of this\none, Digweed skillfully brings up\nthe chunky overdriven bass of track\neight, Venom by Bobby Peru. This\ntrack progresses with bleepy and\nmetallic sounds going all over the\nplace, until towards the end a much\nmore solid beat comes in to tighten\nthings up a bit.\nMoving into the next track, Martin\nSolveig\u2019s Rocking Music, the sound\ngets more serious and driven for\na few minutes, before the bassline\nfrom Slam\u2019s Lie To Me washes up\nand releases the pressure \u2013 the kind\nof bassline that destroys a dance-floor. A few minutes of this and\nthe mix moves on, into the robotic\nwhining of Angel Alanis\u2019 Knob Job.\nAgain the bassline moves things on,\nresolving the tension built from the\nprevious mix.\nNext up is Josh Wink\u2019s mix of\nInfusion\u2019s Better World, with a sample of \u201cThe beat don\u2019t stop\u201d introducing the track before it unleashes\nyet more killer bass. I\u2019ve been hearing this track out and about all over\nthe place, and it really hits the spot.\nThis is the \u2018peak\u2019 of the mix, which\nwould be at around 3-4am in a club.\nAfter this track is Superpitcher\u2019s\nHappiness (\u201cI want happiness/I\nseek happiness\u201d), which keeps\nthings moving, but towards the end\nhas a good minute which is just a\nsynth noise being wound up and\ndown, before it finally becomes a riff\nand the actual music returns. This\nkind of think is usually OK on the\ndancefloor, but as one of my friends\nput it, \u201cWhat are we supposed to\ndo now?\u201d Next is Emico by Joel\nMull, a beautiful slice of prog, surrounded by emotive strings, and the\nmix is finished with the strung out\npseudo vocals of Matrix and Danny\nJ\u2019s Vertigo.\nDiggers has done it again, and\nbrought us what most would\ndescribe as a virtually perfect set.\nThis has blissful beats that\u2019ll keep\nyou warm until the summer comes.\nGet it.\nSimon Clark\nJohn Digweed: one of the forefathers of modern dance\nFeeder\nPushing The Senses\n(Echo)\nHHIII\nThe Others\nThe Others\n(Mercury)\nHHIII\nJohn Digweed\nFabric 20\n(Fabric)\nHHHHI\nThe Others: bloody hell, is that Robert Smith?\nFile under:\nSluggish indie-pop\nIf you like this, try:\nThe earlier, better Feeder\nFile under:\nObsessive fanbase urchin rock\nIf you like this, try:\nThe Libertines, obviously\nFile under:\nDeep and chilled prog house\nIf you like this, try:\nSasha \u2013 Involver\n\n"

Obviously, when words don\u2019t\nwork, sex is used as the ultimate\nweapon of mass destruction.\nIt is an endless infliction of deceit\nand pain. Some may find this\nmovie truthful or revealing. But\nsome may find the characters\nimmoral, shallow, cruel and twisted\nin their own ways. At the end of\nthe day, there isn\u2019t a character that\nyou can stand up for. The improper,\nspiteful, predictable games played\nby Dan and Larry turn their girlfriends to an increasingly depressive state, even though this movie\nnever loses its gloomy surface of\nsexual deception.\nYours truly saw Closer in a sold-out theatre. As there were so many\npeople, and as it has received such\npraise, one would expect this to\nbe a great movie. The story starts\noff nicely, with the first line being\n\u201cHello, stranger\u201d, and the theme of\nrelationships of strangers is carried\nthroughout the movie. Everyone\nmeets as strangers.\nLeaps in time keep the viewers\nconfused for the first minute of each\njump. Why couldn\u2019t there have been\n\u201cone year later\u201d at the bottom of the\nscreen?\nAfter the first half of the movie, you\njust can\u2019t help but wonder, why this\nobsession? At the end of the movie,\nyou do nothing but wonder, what\u2019s\nthe point? Was there a punchline\nsomewhere that was missed?\nHowever, the dialogue in this film\nhas as a superior rhythm of smart,\nquick and witty lines. It is hilarious\nand unbelievably hurtful (the truth\ndoes hurt). It is put together with\nshort, melodramatic, quiet sentences that signify the strength of mind\nand the weakness of the body. The\nopening music (Damien Rice \u2013 The\nBlowers Daughter) will be stuck in\nyour head for ages.\nIt is based on ruthless, pitiless,\nsad, sorry people cheating on each\nother because they can and because\nit feels good. The boredom does\ncatch on after a while into the movie.\nAfter all, Closer is based on a stage\nplay and it must have worked in that\nway. It would still be petty, sleazy\nand disgusting, though it thinks it is\ninfluential, outrageous and uncom-promising.\nThe film tries so hard to be multi-layered and meaningful, with characters begging for each other to be\ncompletely honest with them and\ntalking about the nature of truth.\nBut each one of them is so selfish\nand mean that it is hard to even\nbother to care.\nIf these are typical modern relationships then it is no wonder there\nare so many single people. For all\nits efforts to be refreshingly honest,\nCloser just comes across as annoyingly childish and cynical. Watching\nthis is like watching Eastenders\nwith all the sleeping around.\nAt the end of the movie, you just\nfeel so depressed. It is for the grieving heart.\nCloser to perfection or perversion?\nCloser has been touted as one of the best movies of the year, with numerous nominations\nand awards.

To\nrecap, they were an elite squadron\ncharged with the responsibility of\nensuring world security.

The film follows the elite\n\u2018Team America\u2019, whose mission is to\nensure that the world remains safe\nfrom the terrorists, giving the puppets a chance to show that they can\nsave the world from 21st century\nbad guys.\nFrom the opening scene where\nthe team \u201caccidentally\u201d destroy half\nof Paris through to the profound\n\u201cdicks, pussy and assholes\u201d speech,\nthis film was designed to offend everyone in equal measure, regardless\nof their politics. The captions that\nposition Paris and Cairo relative to\ntheir distance from America and the\ndistance from the Panama Canal to\nthe \u201creal\u201d America provide an excellent geography lesson for slack-jawed yokels, but all this hard work\nwould result them in being rewarded with seeing the mouthpiece of the\nsanctimonious left, Michael Moore,\nsuicide-bomb the Mount Rushmore\nheadquarters of the Team.\nWanton destruction is a major\ntheme running through the film,\nmocking the self-importance, insensitivity to other cultures and lack of\nempathy for non-US casualties of\nAmerican foreign policy. In addition\nto the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triamphe\nand The Louvre, other structural\ncasualties include most of Egypt\u2019s\nancient landmarks.\nThe most scathing criticism\nis reserved for liberal Hollywood\nactors and their well-intentioned\nbut misguided ventures into global\npolitics. Lead by the Film Actors\nGuild (or FAG), they attempt to use\ntheir acting powers to stop Team\nAmerica. They co-organise a world\npeace conference with Kim Jong-Il,\nwho turns out to be in cahoots with\nthe terrorists planning to blow up\nmost of the world. Naturally, Team\nAmerica save the day in the most\nunorthodox manner possible.\nThe fecklessness of the UN is also\nspoofed. Hans Blix warns Kim JongIl that if he does not have access to\nall his palaces then the UN will write\nhim a letter saying that they are\n\u2018very, very mad\u2019 at him. At this point\nDr Blix becomes a snack for Kim\nJong-Il\u2019s pet sharks with no hint of a\nJames Bond style escape.\nThis film is a must see. The plot\nis ridiculous, the score obscene\nand the humour about as dark as it\ncomes. It will have an effect on you\none way or the other: either you\u2019ll\nlaugh to the point of explosion or fire\noff letters to the production compa-nies.

Over the\npast decade, a dozen smaller economies from Mexico\nto Thailand have gone from\ngrowth to deep recession\nwhen their currencies col-lapsed. Even rich countries\nlike Canada have been forced\nto adopt ascetic budget policies to cope with currency-induced turmoil. \u201cWe are\nincreasingly vulnerable to the\nkind of sudden stop, where\nthe capital inflows dry up all\nat once, that\u2019s been the bane\nof emerging markets over\nthe years,\u201d says an economic\nhistorian at the University of\nCalifornia.\nCould it happen in the US?\nA review of past crises suggests the US has enough\ngoing for it now to avoid a\nsimilar fate. Yet the scale of\nthe imbalances now hanging\nover the dollar are also without precedent, suggesting a\ncrisis is still a possibility.\nThe contrasts with the most\nrecent dollar crisis, in the late\n1970s, are both encouraging\nand unsettling.\nBetween September 1977\nand October 1978, the dollar\nfell 16% against major cur-rencies, aided downwards\nby rising oil prices and sluggish economic growth that\npushed the US from a trade\nsurplus to a trade deficit. The\nweaker dollar helped boost\nthe price of imports, and inflation jumped to over 8.2% from\n6.5%.\nWorried that the falling dollar might undermine its anti-inflation efforts, the Carter\nadministration announced a\n\u2018multipart support package\u2019\nin 1978: the Treasury would\nuse sales of gold, foreign borrowing and the International\nMonetary Fund to defend the\ndollar. At the same time, the\nFed would raise its discount\nrate 1%.\nThe dollar stabilized but\nstill remained weak, and\ninflation continued the rise\nup to 10% by June 1979. In\nthe summer of 1979, Paul\nVolcker was appointed, from\nhis previous position of president of the New York Federal\nReserve Bank, as Fed chair-man. Volcker concluded that\ndramatic action was needed\nto break the crippling inflation rates.\nOn 6 October, the Fed\nadopted a new monetary\npolicy for strangling inflation\nby targeting growth in the\nmoney supply, knowing that\nit would send interest rates\nsoaring. Volcker\u2019s new strategy worked; inflation was\nsmothered and this eventually bolstered the dollar, but\nthe price was high: the deepest recession since the Great\nDepression.\nAs it stands, the US has\nproven its strength in the global economy by maintaining\na \u2018twin deficit\u2019, both a large\ncurrent account and budget\ndeficit. The average emerging economy would have\nalready gone belly-up with\nthese twin deficits, but the\nUS has been spared because\nit can still borrow in dollars\ninstead of foreign currency,\nmeaning others bear the pain\nif the dollar depreciates.\nBy contrast, developing\ncountries often borrowed in\ndollars to take advantage of\nlower interest rates, but faced\na crushing repayment burden\nwhen they could no longer\nkeep their currency pegged\nto the dollar.\nEven rich countries, howev-er, have been rocked by a run\non their currencies. It happened to Britain in the 1970s.\nSeveral times in the early\n1990s, Canada\u2019s dollar came\nunder pressure because of\nbig twin deficits.\nThe central bank raised\ninterest rates in response,\nbut that worsened the\nbudget deficit by adding to\ninterest on the public debt.\nWhen Standard & Poor\u2019s, the\nrespected credit ratings agen-cy, reduced the credit rating\non Canada\u2019s foreign currency\ndebt, Canadians thought they\nwould default.\nThe US today has an eerie\nsimilarity with Canada of ten\nyears ago, since both current\naccount and budget deficits\nare about the same size relative to GDP\n, at 5%.\nHowever, the US has an\nadditional advantage over any\nother country when it comes\nto crisis prevention: its economy is simply too large and\ntoo important for the world\neconomy to passively accept\na dollar collapse.\nThat is one reason many\ncountries prop up the dol-lar. China runs a massive\ntrade surplus with the US,\nsomething that would normally force the yuan, the\nUS-pegged currency, to rise\nagainst the dollar. To prevent\nthat, China buys billions of\ndollars in Treasury securities.\nThat protects its exports and\nhelps keep US interest rates\nlow.\nIt has been a decade since\nthe dollar\u2019s drop seemed\ndangerous enough to spark\na firm response from the US\nand its allies.\nIn early 1995, there were\nreports of massive dollar\nsales, some triggered by\nderivatives strategies, driving\nit down sharply against the\nGerman mark and Chinese\nyen. Bond yields were also\nrising and this required intervention from the US Federal\nReserve: Alan Greenspan\nwaded in and bought $600 million of marks and yen.\nThe next day it repeated the\naction, joined by 13 central\nbanks. The dollar stabilized\nand bond yields dropped.\nFosters to bid for\nSouthcorp\nOther business news this\nweek: Fosters Group Ltd is\nto become one of the world\u2019s\nbiggest winemakers by buying out Southcorp in a hostile\n$3.1 billion offer.\nAlready owning 18.8% of\nSouthcorp\u2019s shares, Foster\u2019s\nsaid it will bid $4.17 a share\nfor the remaining 81.2% of\nSouthcorp and assume about\n$500 million of Southcorp\ndebt.\nAs was the case with M&S\nand GoldFields earlier this\nyear, and indeed in many previous hostile takeovers, the\nbid from Fosters is \u201cinadequate and opportunistic,\u201d\naccording to Southcorp.\nShares in Southcorp, last\nquoted at $4.25, surged earlier this week after the takeover bid was announced. A\ntwo-year high of $4.76 was\nreached before the closing\nprice at $4.61.\nCounter-bids are expected from the likes of Diageo\nPLC and Pernod Ricard SA,\nnone of which has significant Australian wine assets,\nmaking such an acquisition\nideal. Interest may also come\nfrom Constellation Brands\nInc., which has a significant\nAustralian presence already\nand has bought California\u2019s\nRobert Mondavi Inc.\nDuring the past year, shares\nin Southcorp have risen\na staggering 75% on hopes\nit will be taken over and on\nexpectations of a turnaround\nin the US wine market, a particularly strong market for\nthe corporation.\nShares in Fosters ended\ndown 7% at $5.27 each as\nsome investors worried about\nintegration risks and prospects for a protracted and\nexpensive bidding war; this\nled to the stock touching a\ntwo month low of $5.22 during\nthe day.\nFosters CEO, Trevor\nO\u2019Hoy, described the offer\nas a \u201cgreat price\u201d and \u201coutstanding opportunity\u201d for\nSouthcorp shareholders.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 20 January 2005\n8\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nNo glove, no love\nAt university there is often a lot of\npartying going on, and for many it is\na time when you spread your wings\nand feel free. University is also a\ntime when many people discover\nthemselves sexually and, as the\nyour social experience increases,\nit is often a chance for you to meet\nnew people and let some of your\nbarriers fall.\nIf you are sexually active it is often\neasy to forget about the risks and\nnot protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nIt is good to enjoy sex and feel good\nabout our relationships, but at some\npoint in your life you may find yourself facing difficulties or problems\nabout your sexual health.\nStaying sexually healthy is about\ndealing with sexual problems as they\nhappen and avoiding them in the\nfirst place. STIs are on the increase\nin this country and it is important to\nbe aware of the risks and to protect\nyourself from these infections.\nThere are at least 25 STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhoea and genital herpes. STIs are some of the\ncommonest infections around the\nworld and affect people of all ages,\nraces and sexualities. As well as\nbeing easy to catch, we also know\nthat you\u2019re more at risk from HIV\nif you sleep with someone who is\nalready carrying an STI.\nWhether you are straight, gay, bi\nor transsexual, you need to protect\nyourself against these infections by\nusing the right type of contracep-tion. And you need to do this until\nboth you and your partner are sure\nthere\u2019s no chance of either of you\ncatching or passing on an STI.\nHere\u2019s a list of some of the better-known STIs:\nChlamydia\nSymptoms: In women, this infection\noften produces no symptoms, but\ncan block the fallopian tubes, causing fertility problems later. You may\nnotice slight discharge or pain on\nurinating. In men, it often affects the\nurethra and causes marked symptoms such as discharge or pain on\nurinating, described as \u2018non-specific-urethritis\u2019 (NSU).\nTreatment: Testing involves a special swab, or urine or blood tests.\nTreatment is with a specific type of\nantibiotics, but it can require several courses of tablets. Your sexual\npartners should be contacted and\nchecked as well.\nGonorrhoea\nCauses: Caused by a bacteria and\ncan affect the vagina, urethra, penis,\nrectum and even the mouth if you\nhave oral sex.\nSymptoms: Women tend to notice\na profuse, yellow or greenish watery\nvaginal discharge and pain on uri-nating. Men may see a yellowy green\ndischarge from the penis and have\npain on urinating. Itching or anal\ndischarge is also possible, though\nsome people get no symptoms at\nall and carry the infection from one\npartner to the next.\nTreatment: There is a risk of damage to your fallopian tubes, with\nreduced fertility, if the infection is\nnot treated. If you have gonorrhoea,\nyou should not have sex until you\nhave had swabs done and a course\nof antibiotic treatment. Your sexual\npartners should be contacted and\nchecked, too.\nHerpes\nCauses: Herpes is a virus (herpes\nsimplex type II) similar to the one\nthat causes cold sores (herpes\nsimplex type I), and is transmitted\nsexually. It\u2019s possible to spread the\ninfection to the mouth during oral\nsex and you might get type I infections in the genital area.\nSymptoms: It can cause painful coldsore-like spots (ulceration)\naround the vagina and the penis.\nAs with cold sores, once you\u2019ve had\nthem, the virus stays in your system\nthroughout your life and could flare\nup again.\nTreatment: There are now antiviral antibiotics, which can be used\nto control and reduce a \u2018flare-up\u2019,\nbut they aren\u2019t a cure. If you\u2019re\npregnant, there is a risk of the baby\ngetting a severe and potentially\nfatal herpes infection, so if you have\nactive ulcers you need to discuss it\nwith your midwife or GP\n.\nSyphilis\nSymptoms: It may start with a sore\nin the vaginal or anal area, or around\nthe genitals in men. Once the initial\nulcer heals, it can stay in your system for years.\nTreatment: Swabs that are usually\nused to test for STIs may show noth-ing, so blood tests are also used in\ndiagnosing syphilis. Although cases\nare rare now, this serious infection\ncan cause infertility and affect the\nheart, blood vessels, skin, bones and\nbrain if left untreated. The infection\ncan be treated with antibiotics and,\nlike other STIs, it is important to\ncontact and test all sexual partners.\nIt is important for you to know the\nsymptoms of STIs and not ignore\nthem in the hope that they will go\naway. If you feel that you may have\ncontracted an STI or if you would\nlike a sexual health check-up, you\nwill need to make an appointment at\nyour local genito-urinary medicine\n(GUM) clinic. To find out where it\nis, you can come to the Information\nand Advice Centre or phone Sexual\nHealth Direct on 0845 310 1334.\nAlternatively, if you live locally\nyou can make an appointment at\nthe Imperial College Health Centre.\nCheck out their webpage, www.\nimperial.ac.uk/healthcentre/health.\nhtm.\nThe Information and Advice\nCentre (IAC) has loads of leaflets\non this issue. The IAC also has a\nlimited supply of condoms which\nwe give out for free \u2013 just pop down\nto the East Wing basement in Beit\nQuad and take a few.\nIf you would like further information on this article or if you have\nany queries on any subject we cover\nplease contact us.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into a\ncrisis \u2013 make the IAC your one stop\nshop for all of your welfare issues.\n\u25cf The Information and Advice\nCentre is now in the East Wing basement of Beit Quad.

Let us know\nRoom bookings\nIn reply to last week\u2019s letter from \u2018a\ndisgruntled director\u2019, we apologise\nfor the problems clubs have been\nfacing with room bookings in the\nUnion and College. We realise there\nare problems and are working to\nrectify them.\nWith regard to College rooms,\nwe have been in talks with the\nConference division, who look after\nInternal room bookings, to make\nthem aware of the problems we have\nbeen having and ways in which they\ncan be avoided in future. We are also\nworking on a written agreement on\nwhat rights our clubs and societies\nhave for College rooms, to ensure\nthat there are clear guidelines. All\nthe complaints we have had have\nbeen passed on to them and we will\nbe meeting with them in the coming weeks to see what progress has\nbeen made.\nIt is important that if you have any\nproblems you pass on the details on\nto myself and our Facilities Manager,\nwho has direct contact with College\ninternal bookings and will be liaising\nbetween College and clubs as the\ncentral point of contact, to improve\nthe process and improve commu-nication.\nWe know that problems are occur-ring, but we need full details if our\nargument is to have strong standing\nwith College. Let us know at dpfs@ic.\nac.uk and facilities@ic.ac.uk.\nThe College is installing a new\nroom booking software system,\nwhich has more capabilities and\nshould reduce problems in the\nfuture.\nThere have also been difficulties\nin the Union, but again only a few\ndetails ever reach us so it is hard\nto see where the real problem lies.\nHopefully, after this response, we\nwill get more information about the\nproblems. We do realise that there\nare issues and are trying to ensure\nthat we improve the process when\nthe system is failing the needs of\nour clubs.\nWe have a limited number of\nrooms with a very large number\nof groups wanting to use them for\nmeetings, rehearsals and other club\nevents, therefore bookings can be\ndifficult to find.\nWe do also hire out our rooms\nto external organisations because\nthey bring in a large revenue\n(approximately \u00a3100,000 per year)\nwhich we reinvest into the Union.\nWe try to ensure these bookings\nare at times when our students and\nclubs want them least (such as during lecture hours and holidays).\nOur priority is student club book-ings, but we need to generate\nincome which is reinvested into the\nUnion for maintaining the building\nand ultimately funding our student\nactivities.\nBudgeting\nIf you are on the committee of a\nclub or society, you will know that\nthe budgeting process is currently\nunderway. Over the last few months,\na Budget Review has been undertak-en, with the feedback from clubs and\nsocieties being conveyed via your\nCSC (Club and Society Committee)\nor FU (Faculty Union) representative and improvements made for\nthis year\u2019s process in response.\nThe budgeting system for this\nyear attempts to be fairer and\nmore flexible. There is much more\nclub and CSC/FU involvement in\nthe final allocation. There is only a\nfinite amount of money (currently\n\u00a3350,000) that the Union is able to\nspend directly on club and society\nbudgets.\nThe new method tries to ensure\nthat the available money will be allocated fairly and in accordance with\nthe clubs\u2019 needs, thereby allowing\nit to be spent effectively rather than\nbeing locked away in areas where\nit will never be used. It also tries to\nensure that the clubs and societies\nenjoy ownership and involvement\nof their budget by allowing them\nto decide how to target the money\nallocated to them.\nSo, do think carefully about your\nbudgets. If you\u2019ve had budget problems this year, please ensure that\nthey don\u2019t happen again. For more\ninformation, contact your CSC or\nFU representatives.\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(FINANCE & SERVICES)\nState of the Union\nBy Mustafa Arif\nUnion President\n\u25cf This space is intentionally\nleft blank, due to your\nPresident\u2019s inability to\nmeet the deadline\n\n"
