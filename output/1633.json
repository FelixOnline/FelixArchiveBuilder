And\nI thought there would be nothing\nbetter than hunting my friend\u2019s\narguments by growing from them.\nPlease bear with me. I know, for\nmost of you, the \u201cVeggie\u201din the title\nput you off.But,if you\u2019re an Imperial\nstudent, it must be that you like\nchallenge, so take it as a challenge\nand read the article until the end.\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning.\nYes, I am vegetarian. Love vegan\ncuisine, too. And guess what? I have\neaten meat for most of my life, 18\nyears, which is about 90% \u2013 you\ncan do the maths in your own time.\nOh, and I love meat. A steak tartare\non a sunny summer day? I used to\ncrave them. That\u2019s right, I just said\nit. So just think about that whilst\nyou still believe I am a green hippie\ntrying to convince you that lettuce\nis so much better than a beef burger.\nI do actually think that, but that\u2019s\nanother story.\nyou\u2019re going to consume meat, you\nneed to accept where it came from \u2013\na real, living, breathing animal that\nwas killed and butchered.\u201d That\u2019s\nhow it all started for me, a couple\nof years ago. I realised something\njust wasn\u2019t right. I would cry seeing\nsomeone slaughter an animal and\nthen feel perfectly emotionless \u2013\nand greedy \u2013 facing that roasted\nlamb in my plate.\nSo I thought: \u2018Eat what you could\nhandle alone\u2019. That\u2019s my motto.\nCould I kill a lamb myself? No.\nCouldIhookafish?No.Conclusion:\nno meat for me. And I must say I\nhave never felt as serene and full of\nintegrity as I do now. Our \u2018modern\u2019\nworld has lost the connection\nbetween the art of hunting \u2013 or\nfishing, for that matter \u2013 and the\nart of cooking, as consumerism led\nto a lucrative manufacture industry.\nPersonally, I just could not handle\nthat huge lie I was concealing from\nmy own conscious under the veil of\nthe food chain supply, which made\nit easier for reality to be distorted.\nStill, I have milked cows. I have\nmade yogurt, even butter, and\ncollected eggs from the henhouse.\nThis partly explains why I don\u2019t\nfeel guilty about having a wedge\nof Tomme de Savoie from time to\ntime, or spreading some churned\nbutter on a slice of lightly toasted\nsourdough bread topped with my\nneighbour\u2019s honey.\nOh, and I don\u2019t live in a farm, for\nthe sceptics. Just so that you don\u2019t\ntry to find yourself some excuses \u2013 I\nlive in a capital city,actually. I mean,\nthe point is not to indoctrinate you.\nThat would be a waste of time.It has\nto be your choice, and choosing to\nbe vegetarian is more than just not\nwilling to kill unnecessarily, but it is\na great starting point.\nThere are a significant amount\nof environmental factors that have\nrooted the veggie power, as I like to\ncall it, even further, and one should\nnot underestimate the impact of the\ncattle industry on climate change.\nThe intention here was to give you\nsome thoughts to grow on. Long\nstory short, be consistent with your\nvalues. Be true to your morals, and\nstick to them.\nEven crazed communists can be vegetarians \u2013 it\u2019s very inclusive group. Photo Credit: Wikimedia Commons\nI have\nmilked\ncows. I\nhave made\nbutter.\nSarah Kakadellis\nWriter\nCould I kill\na lamb?\nCould I\nhook a\nfish?\nSweet potato curry\nAnd to show you vegan cooking\ncan be easy, delicious and inspiring,\nif not more so than any other kind,\nhere is a sweet potato, lentil and\ncoconut curry just for you. And no \u2013\nyou will not be lacking protein!\nThis recipe is all about making it\nto taste \u2013 use lime juice if you want\na sourer kick, or up the cayenne\nfor a warmer heat. Feel free to\nadd lemongrass, whole chiles or\nanything in that vein \u2013 but as it\u2019s\nbeen requested by some readers,\nthis is a recipe with fewer than five\nspices, so I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\nOf course, you could always add\nsome browned chicken breasts, or\nsome juicy prawns,but that wouldn\u2019t\nreally be in the spirit of the dish! Try\nit without, and see.\n2 tbsp cooking oil- olive or\nsunflower\n2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and\ndiced into 2cm chunks (~1kg)\n1 tbsp of turmeric\n1 tbsp of ground cumin\n2 tsp of ground ginger\n2 green cardamom\n1 tsp cayenne\n(or use pre-made garam masala\nfor the above 5 ingredients \u2013 about\n2tbsp)\n2 cloves garlic, finely diced\n1 onion, white or red, sliced\n500g green lentils, rinsed\n2 tins coconut milk\n2 tins diced tomatoes\n2 cups green olives\nsalt, pepper\n1 lemon \u2013 or a lime, see note\nabove.\nHandful coriander leaves\nHeat the oil in a large, high\nsided pan \u2013 a casserole dish would\nbe ideal. Once hot, add the cubed\nsweet potato and get it browning.\nYou want to caramalise each face of\nthe cubes, so stir them moderately\nfrequently.\nWhen almost brown all over, add\nthe spices, garlic and onion. Sweat\nthem for a few minutes, and then\nadd the lentils, coconut milk and\ntomatoes. Bring to a simmer, and\nkeep on a low heat for about 30\nminutes, or until the lentils are\njust cooked. If the sauce is now too\nthick, thin it out with a few splashes\nof water.\nFinish the dish with the green\nolives and the juice of a lemon,\nbefore topping it with some fresh\ncoriander leaves. Serve with some\nsteamed rice.\nMango sticky rice\nThis is a perfect vegan pudding \u2013\nespecially as alphonso mangoes will\nsoon be in season! If you want to\nfind some, make a trip to Southhall\nfor the best ones.\n300g glutinous rice\n1 tin coconut milk\n3 tbsp sugar\npinch salt\n2tbsp coconut cream\n2 ripe mangoes\nSoak the rice for 10 minutes in\nexcess water. Drain, and add to a\nmicrowaveable bowl with water to\njust cover. Clingfilm the top, and\nmicrowave until tender \u2013 about ten\nminutes.Bringtheotheringredients,\napart from the mango, to a boil and\npour over. Let it cool and then serve\nwith the sliced mango.\nReading last week\u2019s article was\nvery inspiring, and people could be\nsurprised by it, but it does relate a\nlot to vegetarians too. The ethical\ndebate that was raised is exactly the\nreason why I chose to be vegetarian,\nand which also explains why I am\nnot fully vegan. But let me explain\nit to you, with my friend\u2019s quote: \u201cIf\n\n"

It\u2019s so bad it\u2019s\ngood. And it\u2019s self-aware. We\u2019ve\nreached peak irony, and I for one\nlove it.\nThe band is hard to pin down\nstylistically. Clearer influences\nare dishwashers and industrial\nmotors. If one listens carefully, they\nmay discern MC Ride rapping,\ngibberish-ing, and occasionally\nscreaming incoherently. Flatlander,\nsometimes known as \u201cAndrew,\u201d\nproduces, and is possibly having\na seizure at the mixing board\n(someone should check on him).\nZac Hill puts down drum tracks\nthat sound like Questlove on\ncrack \u2013 you might know him from\nHella, or a one-off with Weiss and\nCameron (you know, Pearl Jam and\nSoundgarden) featuring nothing\nbut drums, appropriately titled\n\u2018Drumgasm\u2019.\nThebandiserratic.Thisistheirfirst\neffort after their pledged breakup.\n\u201cWe are now at our best and so\nDeath Grips is over.\u201d \u201cPlz give us\nmore,\u201d cried the internet. \u201cYou\u2019re\nright, we might do another,\u201d said\nthe band. Being a Death Grips fan\ninvolves grueling masochism; the\ncancelled shows,their evasive nature\n(having done, to my knowledge,\nonly one interview \u2013 with Pitchfork,\na few years back), and the constant\npush to inaccessibility with every\nnew album.\nMC Ride\u2019s characteristic\naggression is worthy of special\nnotice. \u201cI don\u2019t care about real life\u201d\nis the hook from the first song\noff Jenny Death \u2013 titled \u2018I Break\nMirrors With My Face In The\ntheir sound in new directions.\nRide\u2019s rapping has become\ningrained into the texture of the\nsong. The stuttering beats on \u2018Three\nBedrooms In A Good Neighbors\u2019\nmix with cyberpunk-esque vibes\ncoherently. The riff to \u2018Bottomless\nPit,\u2019 the album\u2019s closer, is a straight-up punk banger. \u2018Trash\u2019 starts with\na V-I fanfare, over which Ride\nraps unusually conventionally. On\n\u20188080808,\u2019 they actually sample\n\u2018Lock your Doors\u2019 off NO LOVE\nDEEP WEB. \u201cWhy?\u201d, you may ask.\nWell, why not?\nWhere are all the women in hip-hop?\nBen Collier\nWriter\nW\nith hip hop, as a\ngenre and a culture,\npassing its 40th\nanniversary in\nrecent years, a female presence is as\nabsent as ever. This is, of course, not\nfor a lack of talent. Ignoring some\nexamples like Iggy Azalea and\nKreayshawn, there is a lot of female\ntalent to be found in the realm of hip\nhop music. But when I go onto the\nfeatured rap artist page on Spotify I\nonly see two women (Missy Elliot\nand MC Lyte) and around 60 men.\nAs someone who wants to see more\nLauryn Hills in the world, I really\nhave to question why this is.\nThe obvious answer ties into ideas\nof masculinity. Traditionally, hiphop music is synonymous with ideas\nof toughness, bravado and the \u2018alpha\nmale\u2019. This creates a culture where\nany aspiring female MC must be a\n\u201cboss ass bitch\u201d in order to be taken\nseriously. This is true for gangster\nrap anyways. As for the mainstream,\nany women that do make it big are\noften hypersexualised in an effort to\nappeal the average male hip hop fan.\nUltimately, whilst the topic of sex\nis something which features heavily\nin the lyrics of a lot of male rappers,\nthe way it is approached here is\ntotally different. With a few notable\nexceptions (e.g. Missy Elliot\u2019s\n\u2018Work It\u2019) the way in which most\nfemale MCs talk about sex just\nshows us men\u2019s sexual fantasies from\nthe other side. Female rappers rarely\ntalk about sex from any position\nof power. \u201cYou can fuck my girls\ntoo, daddy I\u2019m-a condone it\u201d and\n\u201cyes you be the boss, and yes I be\nrespecting\u201d are literal Nicki Minaj\nlyrics. It\u2019s a world away from her\nA bottomless balloon pit? Photo Credit: Death Grips\nThe back cover of Death Grips latest album. Photo Credit: Death Grips\nwithout meaning? If I were better at\nphilosophy, I could tell you how this\nis all an excellent criticism of late\ncapitalism or something, but I think\nI\u2019ll leave that to better reviewers.\nI dunno, man, carve out your own\nmeaning.But there\u2019s some neat stuff\nthere.\nTen years ago, this album would\nhave been massacred by critics.\nToday, they love it. Perhaps this\nspeaks to some generational divide,\nwith respect to a newfound sense\nof irony, a fatalist zeitgeist without\nregard for form, structure, or\nobjective aesthetics which manifests\nin this piss-take of \u201creal\u201d music.\nIndeed, in their break-up note,\nDeath Grips refers to themselves\nas a \u201cConceptual art exhibition,\nanchored by sound and vision,above\nand beyond a \u2018band.\u2019\u201d Or maybe the\nlack of sleep from exam stress is\nkilling me, and I have no idea what\nI\u2019m talking about. Either way, if you\nlike the style, you won\u2019t have more\nfun with an album this year.\nBottomless Pit is out now\nBeing a\nDeath\nGrips fan\ninvolves\ngrueling\nmasochism\nUnited States,\u2019delivered with Ride\u2019s\ntrademark insanity. Like, really?\nIncoherent screaming and pledges\nthat \u201cYou\u2019re fit to learn the meaning\nof a beat down\u201d (\u2018No Love\u2019 off NO\nLOVE DEEP WEB) grace his\nperformance. Ride\u2019s artistic touch\nhas left every Death Grips album\nto date littered with primal violence.\n\u201cIT GOES IT GOES IT GOES\nIT GOES / GUILLOTINE!\u201d\nAnd yet, it all fits together. At the\nservice of the band is a boatload of\ntalent, and a healthy sense of irony\nand self-consciousness. Combined\nwith punk ethos, the one sentence\nthat comes to mind to describe the\ngroup is, \u201cEh, screw it, why not?\u201d\nEach past effort has succeeded in\nthe past because you don\u2019t expect\nit to \u2013 it\u2019s perfectly composed, and\nhideous at the same time.\nAnd now, the new album.\nBottomless Pit is... exactly what\nyou\u2019d think would happen. \u2018Hot\nHead\u2019is by far the most inaccessible\ntrack, complete with Ride literally\nscreaming nonsense with wild\nabandon over bucking synths. The\nsynths still sound like they\u2019re being\nplayed out of a blown-out speaker,\nand Hill still serves up some pretty\ngnarly drumming.\nBut, the band continues to push\nWhy bother\nmaking\nsense in\na world\nwithout\nmeaning?\nAlso,\u2018Warping\u2019is if a bad acid trip\nwas a song.\nThe lyrics are best described as the\nincoherent ravings of a psychopath.\nI\u2019d repeat some of the stranger verses\nhere,but Cale might think I\u2019ve had a\nstroke and phone an ambulance.The\nband projects an ethos of hedonism\nand nihilist existentialism; why\nbother making sense in a world\nLil Kim, Missy Elliot, Lauryn Hill and Foxy Bronwn. Photo Credit: Vibe Magazine\nverse on \u2018Monster\u2019 isn\u2019t it?\nThis masculine culture is shaped\nby both the artists and the fans.\nThe success of rap songs nowadays\nis largely determined by internet\ncommunities mostly made up\nof young males. These groups\nare perhaps not the most open\nto listening to female MCs. As\na result of this, hip-hop culture\nremains very accepting of a lot of\nmisogynistic language and ideas.\nIn the end, asking why there aren\u2019t\nmore women in hip hop seems to\nbe comparable to asking why there\naren\u2019t more black country singers. I\nthink there is hope though; perhaps\nwith a progressive movement away\nfrom the \u2018gangster rap\u2019 culture of\nthe past towards the sound and\nphilosophies of rappers like Chance\nthe Rapper, Lupe Fiasco and J.\nCole we\u2019ll see more women come\nup. I hope so anyway.\nFemale\nrappers\nrarely talk\nabout sex\nfrom any\nposition of\npower\nOne need only look to the career\ntrajectory of Nicki Minaj from\n\u2018Playtime is Over\u2019 to \u2018Anaconda\u2019\nto see how this \u2018sex sells\u2019 ideology\nends up shaping the output of the\nmajority of female MCs.\nSend your hot-takes, Kanye\ninspired rants, Radiohead\nloveletters, Beyonc\u00e9 listicles,\nironic dank memes, PC Music\nhype articles, mixtapes, and\nshitty demo tracks to:\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Photo Credit: HBO\nTaming a dragon; should be as easy as walking a dog. Photo Credit: HBO\nAnurag Deshpande\nWriter\nF\nollowing last week\u2019s\nrelatively uneventful,\nmeasured episode, Game of\nThrones cranks the dial up\nto eleven with this one. Last time\nwas the safety briefing; now we\u2019ve\nhit the first drop on the rollercoaster.\nWe open in Winterfell of old, as\nBran and the Three-eyed Raven\nwatch the previous generation\nof Starks in their younger days.\nThe scene serves as an excellent\nreintroduction to Bran, and an\neffective way to familiarise the\naudience with his growing abilities;\nwithout resorting to an exposition\ndump.\nWe finally catch a (non-stone)\nglimpse of Lyanna Stark; getting\nsome idea of character. This serves\nto give us some context on the\nwoman who launched a civil war,\nand puts her in the forefront of\nour minds in anticipation of next\nweek; when we\u2019ll be treated to\nperhaps one of the most important\nevents in recent Westerosi history.\nInterestingly, there is also a glimpse\nof young Hodor, with his faculties\nintact.Given the tight pacing of this\nepisode, it seems unlikely that this\nwould be included without cause.\nThen, in King\u2019s Landing, it\u2019s\nMyrcella\u2019s funeral, but first we stop\nby the pub to pay our respects to\nthe flasher from Cersei\u2019s walk of\nshame last season. Alongside a very\nagitated Robert \u2018totally not the\nmountain\u2019 Strong. I mean, come on,\nhis name is in the credits.This scene\nis actually pretty funny,and provides\na nice respite from all the other\nseriousness in the episode. In fact,\nCersei, has a little trouble with\nfaithful husbands) in the sept;\nstopped only by the appearance of\na lot of the faithful. This scene also\ngives us a fantastic line in the form\nof the Sparrow\u2019s codded warning\nto Jamie, \u201cI fear a great many\nthings\u2026the father, the mother, the\nwarrior\u201d. Cersei\u2019s original cold and\nvindictive persona also makes a bit\nof a resurgence, after the previous\nepisode\u2019s attempts to make her seem\nmore sympathetic and likeable. The\nbalance struck here is just right.\nIn present day Winterfell,\nwhatever Roose Bolton\u2019s\nmachinations for Ramsey are move\nforward as his wife gives birth to a\nbaby boy. For about two minutes,\nthat is, when Ramsey decides to\nstab him to death. Poisoned by his\nenemies, such a sad way to go. This\nmay be the biggest issue with the\nepisode. Bolton Sr. feels completely\nwasted, and his arc a massive anti-climax. Maybe there was some\nBack in Mereen, things continue\nto fall apart,so Tyrion decides to see\nif he can get the Dragons involved.\nThe scene actually adds some\ninteresting depth to the dragon\u2019s\ncharacterisation, and makes them\nfeel like more than just the one note\nkilling machines we\u2019ve seen up till\nnow. Dinklage, in particular, is on\ntop form here, as he does a great job\nof building tension considering he\u2019s\nworking with CGI.\nTheon decides to part ways with\nSansa and head home; promising to\nmake good to the Starks. But which\nhome? Will he head to the Iron\nIslands, or to Winterfell, to try and\nget even with Ramsey. Speaking\nof the Iron Islands, we\u2019re finally\nreunited with Balon Greyjoy.

But it was the\nfirst of many points in the play\nwhen director Jeremy Herrin makes\nthe experience of the drug and\ncigarette addicted protagonist the\naudience\u2019s experience as well.

In this way, the\nproduction actually sheds light on\npsychiatric issues that are rarely\ndiscussed in public, much less in\nsuch a visceral way.\nPerhaps on a more metaphorical\nlevel, these multiple selves of Emma\nrepresent her conflicted views of\nthe world and fragments of identity\nthat she cannot reconcile. Emma/\nSarah is clearly a sharply intelligent\ngirl who overthinks the workings\nof the world, and creates for herself\nelaborate, noble excuses for her\ndrug habit. \u201cHow can you sit here\npretending that everything is going\nto be alright when there are people\nstarving in the world?\u201d she asks the\ntherapist. \u201cDrugs are the only way\nto make me feel authentic, give me\nreal experiences. If I deny myself\nchoice,\u201d she declares, \u201cthen what\nam I?\u201dThese may be the words of a\nhelpless addict, but it is a sensitive\nacknowledgement of the addict\u2019s\nown perspective that her habit is the\nonly sense of control she feels over\nher life and her view of the world.\nyoung drug addict seeking help at a\ndrug rehabilitation clinic. Although\nnot an uncommon narrative, this\nproduction wins with the intensity\nwith which we are immersed in it,\nespecially in the mind of the girl\nherself.\nBest Actress winner Denise Gough in her as a drug addict in People, Places and Things.

Behind her prickly exterior\nlies a girl who desperately wished\nfor acceptance by her mother. This\ntheme of acting and meta-acting\nwas displayed from the start, when\nthe \u201cbackstage\u201d curtains fell shortly\nafter the play began to reveal\nanother set of audiences on the\nother side.Each block of audience is\nwatching and being watched by the\nother \u2013 emphasizing the staginess of\nthe stage in between.\nPeople, Places and Things is an\nintense, visceral experience that will\ngive you your high (safely), while\nalso getting you to question your\nassumptions about the world.\nPeople, Places and Things is at the\nWyndham\u2019s Theatre until 18th\nJune.\nThe\nprotagonist\u2019s\nidentity is as\nfluid as her\ndelusions\nVariously known as Nina,\nEmma, Sarah and Lucy, the\nprotagonist\u2019s identity is as fluid as\nher delusions.

I gasped\nas the exit sign on stage swirled\nT\nhe National\u2019s latest\nmodernisation of an old\nclassic, The Suicide has all\nthe potential of a biting\nsatirical comedy with little of the\nfinesse or foundation to really pull\nit off.

With a solid supporting\ncast including the likes of Paul Kaye\nand Ashley McGuire, the overall\npresentation is enjoyable, but not\nexactly special.\nAs is so often the case at the\nNational, the set is a highlight of\nthe production with all the frills and\nflair of big budget theatre. However,\ndespite its impressive appearance, it\nfeelsoddlyunoriginal.Thinkingback\nto the shows of 2015, The Suicide\u2019s\nstylised dystopian backdrop,\nfrequent use of multimedia and\ndrum solo soundtrack all bear\nuncanny resemblance to the\nproduction features in Golem \u2013 a\npersonal highlight from last year\u2019s\ncalendar.\nThe Suicide is far from boring,\nbut the play fails to take that step\nabove and beyond the comedy. The\nlaughs are often cheap and hastily\nstereotyped \u2013 for what should be a\nfiery political satire, the comedy is a\nlittle bland. It is clear that the script\nis for today\u2019s audience with many\nof the best jokes touching on the\ncurrent affairs of 2016. However, I\ncan\u2019t help but feel that more time\nin development would have done\nwonders for this production. Where\nthe script seems to be steering to\nhilarity, the punchlines are a let-down,and where split second timing\nis crucial, the text is too fluffy to\nreally hit home. Equally, while the\nmomentum consistently builds as\nthe play goes on, the two and a half\nhour runtime leaves the last thirty\nminutes stagnant.

With fewer players now,\ndD knew both games would be\ntough, particularly with a re-match\nagainst Southampton who came out\nfighting, however dD were able to\nkeep the intensity up and won 12-2\nin the end. The Sheffield game was\nvery close, with the teams trading\npoints throughout,but dD came out\n9-7 winners with great defence play\ngiving them the win.\nThis put us in the plate final\nagainst Kent, a team we had beaten\n13-4 previously in the season. With\na very small squad from injuries at\nthis point, dD knew it would be a\ntough game. Everyone came out\nfighting and gave it their all, with\ndD playing incredibly well in windy\nconditions to go 7-0 up, including\nthree upwind points! At this point\nKent came out fighting clawing the\ngame back to 7-4, however it wasn\u2019t\nenough as dD won 9-4.\nThe players can be very proud\nof winning the division two plate,\nshowing the great quality that\nwe have in a squad with a mix of\nvast experience and relatively new\nplayers.\nWomen\u2019s 1st\nTeam\nThe weekend started on a cold and\nsunny Saturday morning, with the\nwomen in a good position; seeded\n2nd\nin Div 2, and top of their group.\nTheir first game was against\nManchester, an enjoyable game and\nan opportunity for the team to find\ntheir flow. The final score was 11-1\nto Imperial; a great start to weekend.\nThe second game was against\nCardiff, who although seeded at\nthe bottom of the group, proved\nthey certainly didn\u2019t belong there\nby fighting a tough fight against the\nwind with some good catches in bad\nwind. Imperial eventually worked it\ndown the pitch though to win the\ngame 6-3.\nThe final game of pool play was\nagainst Sheffield Hallam, who also\nput up a good fight. They came out\nwith a tight zone defence, and some\nvery safe catches that Imperial just\ncouldn\u2019t quite beat and the women\nlost 8-2. This meant that a tense\ncrossover game awaited against\nReading, which if lost would mean\nthe team could only finish as high as\n8th\n. It was a tight game, and points\nwere traded throughout, both teams\ndesperate to avoid being in the lower\nbracket, but the women worked it\nthrough the gaps in their defence\nwith every player contributing. It\nended with a tense universe point,\nwhich Imperial won to leave them\nin the top bracket.\nDay two started slowly, as the\nregret of too much pizza and the\nconsequences of sleeping on a cold\nscout hut floor took hold, but the\nwomen came out fighting against\nNottingham, the weekend\u2019s hosts.\nUnfortunately despite Imperial\nfinding their swing quickly and\nplaying some excellent offence,\nNottingham were just too strong\nand won 11-5.\nAfter watching the boys beat\nSouthampton (again), the girls were\nready to take on Southampton\u2019s\nwomen\u2019s team. Once again a strong\nperformance gave the women a\n10-4 victory.\nThe final game was against\nSwansea where the wind picked up\nand Imperial took the opportunity\nto bring out their zone defence\nwhich they\u2019d been practicing all\nweekend. It all came together and\nSwansea just couldn\u2019t compete.\nCombined with some excellent\nupwind points from Imperial, the\nwomen took the final game 10-1, to\nfinish in 5th\nplace.\nAll in all an excellent weekend\nfor Imperial\u2019s inaugural women\u2019s\noutdoor team, playing against some\ntough teams but they came together\nand played well as a team. MVP\nwent to Si-Ci Ong,and MIP to Poh\nHui Xian (Fish).\nMany thanks must go to the\ncaptains and coaches for enabling\nboth teams to play so well at this\nlevel and to also bring on-board and\nincorporate new players in the team.\nThe game\nfinished 8-4\nto Heriot \u2013 a\ntypical dD\nstart to a\ntournament!\nLucy Rowlands & Anthony\nFeatherstone\nWriters\nDon\u2019t play frisbee if you\u2019re not willing to get a bit grubby.

Portugal\nare not returning this year and\nRomania were disqualified at the\nlast minute due to non-payment of\ndebts to the European Broadcasting\nUnion (their song was one of my\nfavourites, I\u2019m not even bitter).\nHere are my top ten songs to keep\nan eye out for, comprised of some\nof the bookies\u2019 favourites as well as\nsome of my own, in no particular\norder:\nMalta Russia\nMontenegro\nSweden Bulgaria\nFrance\nCyprus Estonia\nAnd I\u2019ve not forgotten about the\nUnited Kingdom! For the first year\nI\u2019ve not included the UK in my list,\nbecause our chances of doing well\nare particularly slim this year. I like\nthe song, \u2018You\u2019re Not Alone\u2019 by Joe\nand Jake, but it\u2019s a tad forgettable\nand isn\u2019t helped by us not being too\npopular with Europe at the moment\n(owing to a certain referendum).\nWe\u2019ll struggle to get out of the\nbottom five this year, maybe we\u2019ll\neven place last. But that\u2019s nothing\nnew, and it\u2019s all part of the fun!\nAnd that\u2019s not all. There are 31\nother songs in this year\u2019s contest.\n18 will perform in each of the semi\nfinals,with ten from each joining the\nBig Five plus Sweden in the Grand\nFinal. The perfect procrastination\nmaterial: the semi-finals take place\non the 10th\nand 12th\nof May, with the\nGrand Final following on Saturday\nthe 14th. Don\u2019t miss it!\nJAMIE THOMAS\nPhoto Credit: Eurovision Photo Credit: Eurovision Photo Credit: Eurovision\nPhoto Credit: Eurovision Photo Credit: Eurovision\nPhoto Credit: Eurovision Photo Credit: Eurovision Photo Credit: Eurovision\nI loved Montenegro\u2019s song last\nyear despite the odds of it winning\nbeing 100/1. This year the odds are\n500/1 but again there\u2019s something\nabout it that I can\u2019t get enough of,\nprobably the driving guitar riff of\nthe chorus. \u2018The Real Thing\u2019 by\nHighway is a powerful but cheesy,\nrock-come-dubstep song that\nprobably won\u2019t qualify for the final,\nbut will certainly get the arena\ngoing during the semis. Then again,\nMontenegro beat the odds last year\nand ended up not only qualifying\nfor the final, but also placing a very\nrespectable 13th\n. Can Highway do\nthe same this year? (I doubt it.)\nIra Losco represented Malta in\n2002, placing a very impressive 2nd\nin the final. Fourteen years later and\nshe\u2019s back again! She\u2019ll be singing\n\u2018Walk On Water\u2019, a punchy, crowd-pleasing song that\u2019s one of the\nfavourites to win.I\u2019m less convinced,\nfinding it a little forgettable, but it\u2019s\nsure to place in the top ten. Can Ira\nbeat her 2002 attempt and bring\nEurovision 2017 to Valletta? It\u2019s a\ndefinite possibility!\nRussia came second last year,much\nto the dismay of the arena, with\n\u2018anti-booing technology\u2019 having to\nbe employed for the first time in\nthe competition\u2019s history. This year\nthey\u2019re favourite to win, sending\nSergey Lazarev to sing \u2018You Are\nThe Only One\u2019, a song that is pure\nEurovision. With its infectiously\ncatchy chorus and driving beat\nthat\u2019ll have everyone at home\u2019s toes\ntapping, it\u2019s a really solid song.\nMinus One are representing\nCyprus with \u2018Alter Ego\u2019, one of the\nfew rock songs this year. Eurovision\ncan be a tough place for rock groups\nwho aren\u2019t dressed up as monsters,\nbut I think \u2018Alter Ego\u2019 has enough\npop influence to qualify for the final,\nand I love it! Cyprus has never won\nthe competition before, in fact the\nbest they\u2019ve ever placed is fifth.They\ndon\u2019t look set to beat that this year\nbut a top ten finish for this song\nwould be a success.\nThis year\u2019s host nation takes\nEurovision seriously. Very\nseriously. Their selection process,\nMelodifestivalen, is one of the most\nwatched shows in the Swedish\ntelevision calendar and is probably\nthe most rigorous selection process\nin Europe. This year, by some\nmiracle, Frans and his song \u2018If I\nWere Sorry\u2019 won and will represent\nSweden. By an even bigger miracle,\nit\u2019s third favourite to win. How\nwhat I think is a painfully boring,\nmonotonous, middle-of-the-road\nsong is so popular is a mystery to\nme. Nonetheless it\u2019ll definitely\nmake the top five, maybe make the\ntop three and could well win.\nBeing a member of the Big Five,\nFrance automatically qualifies\nfor the final, and this year it\u2019s set\nto finish in the top three. Amir\nwill sing \u2018J\u2019ai Cherch\u00e9\u2019, an upbeat,\ncatchy,feel-good song that\u2019ll get the\narena going and the viewers voting.\nThough it\u2019s not in my personal\ntop three, I wouldn\u2019t be sad to see\nthis win. After all, Paris is pretty\nclose to London (somewhere the\ncompetition definitely won\u2019t be held\nnext year).\nBulgaria first entered Eurovision\nin 2005, and has only gotten to\nthe final once. They\u2019re returning to\nthe contest for the first time since\n2013, sending Poli Genova to sing\n\u2018If Love Was a Crime\u2019. A returning\nartist, Poli represented Bulgaria\nin 2012, failing to qualify. This\nyear she\u2019s set to do well with this\nupbeat, powerful anthem. I\u2019d like\nto see Bulgaria place in the top five,\nbecause I love the song.\nIf George Ezra were to perform\na song by Gary Barlow, you\u2019d have\nEstonia\u2019s entry this year. The deep-voiced J\u00fcri Pootsmann will sing\n\u2018Play\u2019, and I love it. Dark, subtle\nand jazzy, it\u2019s one of my top songs\nthis year. It\u2019s not expected to do\nparticularly well, but I\u2019ll class it\nqualifying for the final as a success.\nGo J\u00fcri!\nHighway Ira Losco Sergey\nLazarev\nMinus One Frans\nAmir Poli Genova J\u00fcri\nPootsmann\n\u2018The Real Thing\u2019 \u2018Walk On Water\u2019\nLatvia\nPhoto Credit: Eurovision\nLatvia are sending Justs with his\nsong \u2018Heartbeat\u2019, a song that I\u2019m\nnot all too enamoured with. Using\nup all of its potential with a great\nfirst verse that wouldn\u2019t sound out\nof place on a Metronomy album,\nthe song soon turns into a slightly\ntedious club anthem that somehow\nboth ends abruptly whilst also\nmaking three minutes seem like a\nlong time.

It\u2019s\nbullshit.\nAlthough I know that it\u2019s not\nmy fault when I get harassed, it\u2019s\nimportant to me that my friends\nreinforce this, instead of somehow\nmaking me feel responsible; in\nthis, most of my friends are great,\nindignant on my behalf and\nsympathising with how annoying,\nupsetting or scary it was.\nHowever, I\u2019ve noticed a trend in\nsome of my male friends\u2019 responses\nwhen I come to them to vent about\nsome random guy who felt the\nneed to tell me how attractive (or\nnot) I was: telling me I should have\nbehaved differently.\nI recently came home frustrated\nafter having almost identical\nconversations with two men on\nthe way home, both of whom took\nissue with my ignoring them when\nthey \u201cjust wanted to give [me] a\ncompliment\u201d, wanting to have a bit\nof a rant and get on with my day.\nMy friend, a man, was naturally\non my side, but criticised my\nresponse,saying that I \u201cshouldn\u2019t get\nso confrontational\u201d.\nTo clarify, I had told the men that\ntheir comments were unwanted\nand unsolicited \u2013 I didn\u2019t raise my\nvoice, swear, or even respond until\nthey became verbally aggressive\nwhen I ignored them. That\u2019s not\nto say I didn\u2019t want to, but for me,\nan encounter like this is a mental\nbattle between \u201cI want to provoke\nthis person into reconsidering their\nbehaviour\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want to\nprovoke this person into becoming\nviolent\u201d \u2013 the latter generally taking\nprecedence. When these men\nbecame angry at being ignored,I felt\nmy safest option was to engage. But\nwhat, then, was I supposed to say?\nShould I have smiled and laughed\nalong, reinforcing their belief that\ntheir comments were acceptable, all\nthe while itching to leave as quickly\nas possible?\nI have tried this strategy and it\ndoes not work. You cannot play\nalong forever; there comes a time\nin any situation like this where you\nhave to tell the harasser \u201cno\u201d. You\nignore them, you tell them you\u2019re\nin a hurry, you tell them you\u2019re not\ninterested, that you don\u2019t want to\ngive them your number, that you\nwant them to stop talking to or\ntouching you, that you are \u2018taken\u2019,\nand sometimes one of these is\nenough, but sometimes not, and\nthere is no one phrase which will\ninstantly deter further attention. In\nshort, there is no right way to react.\nOf course, the primary concern\nshould always be personal safety,\nbut when this happens on a regular\nbasis, \u201cSorry, I have a boyfriend\u201d\nstarts to taste increasingly sour in\nyour mouth. So, sometimes, you\nget \u201cconfrontational\u201d by pointing\nout that you\u2019re not interested\nin a stranger\u2019s thoughts on your\nappearance.\nI know that my friend was just\nconcerned for my welfare, and his\nadvice given with good intentions,\nbut when you don\u2019t face sexual\nharassment on a regular basis it\nis harder to empathise with how\nit feels, so it\u2019s infuriating when\nmen give helpful comments such\nas \u201cI\u2019d be so sassy [in response to\nharassment] if I were a woman\u201d,\n\u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just say you had a\nboyfriend?\u201dor \u201cI don\u2019t get it,he\u2019s just\ntalking to you.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re a man and a woman is\ntelling you about a time when she\ngot harassed, there are a couple of\nthings you should know: First, there\nare countless other instances she\nhasn\u2019t told you about. This is not\nthe only time.\nSecond, you cannot know how\nyou would respond in her shoes\nbecause you have not experienced\nthose countless other instances.\nDon\u2019t try to tell her what she should\nhave done, but be responsive to her\nfeelings \u2013 if she\u2019s telling you because\nit was funny, agree that it was funny,\nand if she\u2019s telling you because it\nupset her,agree that it was upsetting.\nDon\u2019t tell her that her emotions are\nwrong, and definitely don\u2019t tell her\nthat she\u2019s overreacting and it wasn\u2019t\nharassment at all.\nThere is no\none phrase\nwhich will\ninstantly\ndeter further\nattention\nWhen you\ndon\u2019t face\nsexual\nharassment\non a regular\nbasis it is\nharder to\nempathise\nwith how it\nfeels\n\n"

Its\napplications include uses in\nmonitoring chronic kidney damage,\nradiology, the cardiovascular system\nand transplantation.\nThe other universities taking\npart in the competition include:\nThe University of Leuven, Uppsala\nUniversity,The Technical University\nof Denmark and Eindhoven\nUniversity of Technology. SensUs\nis the first international student\ncompetition involving molecular\nbiosensors for healthcare\napplications, and is being organised\nby students at the Eindhoven\nUniversity of Technology in\ncollaboration with professors from\ninternational universities.\nCreatinine is a by-product of the\nphosphorylation of creatine and is\ncatalysed by the enzyme creatine\nkinase. Kinases are enzymes which\nuse ATP (adenosine triphosphate,\nthe body's immediate supply\nof chemical energy) to transfer\nphosphate groups onto molecules,\nsuch as creatine, turning ATP into\nADP (adenosine diphosphate).\nThe product of the reaction is\nphosphocreatine which is used\nto turn ADP back into ATP in\ntimes of high physical stress;\nphosphocreatine requires low effort\nto synthesize when the body has\nexcess ATP.\nCreatinine is useless to the body so\nit has to be removed by the kidneys.\nIf the filtration in the kidneys is\ndeficient, the level of creatinine in\nthe blood rises. Consequently, by\nsensing the concentrations, doctors\ncan determine kidney-associated\nillnesses in patients. It is therefore a\nvery important compound and any\nimprovements to current sensors\nwill be a remarkable achievement.\nThe sensing of creatinine has four\nmain application areas: monitoring\nchronic kidney damage, the study\nof agents that are a burden on the\nkidneys in radiology, the study of\nthe effects of diuretics on the kidney\nin cardiovascular studies, and in the\nmonitoring of transplanted kidney\nfunction as part of patient care.\nProfessor Tony Cass and\nDoctor Christopher Johnson, the\nsupervisors of the Imperial team,\nact as consultants to the Imperial\nteam and are able to provide\nguidance to the team due to their\nextensive knowledge in both\nbiochemistry, bioengineering and\nmolecular biosensors. Although\nit is a student-only competition,\nthe team seeks help on any specific\nproblems encountered along the\nway and liase with the supervisors\nand various companies to attain\nA very happy ensemble on a very successful trip! Photo Credit: SensUs Imperial\nThe team\naims to\nproduce\na fully\nfunctioning\ncreatinine\nsensor which\nrivals those\ncurrently\navailable\nImperial puts forward a team in an\ninternational sensor building competition\nany equipment or facilities needed.\nMoreover, they have generously\ncontacted companies and are in\ncharge of the teams funding. One\ncompany, OrionTM, has kindly\nsupplied free electrodes to the team\nwho are hoping to start working in\nlabs in the summer term.\nThe Imperial College team aims\nto produce a fully functioning\ncreatinine sensor which rivals those\ncurrently available. The Imperial\nteam is made up of five chemists,\nJohn Welsh, Ana Losada, Ning\nVoon, Onur Guzel, and Taiwo\nLawal, four bioengineers, Francesco\nGuagliardo, Edward Da Fonseca,\nValeria Trujillo, and Riccardo\nBarbano, a biochemist, Rufus\nMitchell-Heggs, mathematician,\nLawrence Stewart, and a physicist,\nThomas Lord.\nThe Imperial team is currently\nconducting market research on\nexisting sensors by asking various\nexperts in the field including\nclinicians, GPs and professors. They\nwill use the information gathered\nto decide whether to improve on an\nexisting model, which uses enzymes\nto detect the compounds in the\nblood, or to go in another direction,\npossibly researching the potential\nuse of molecularly imprinted\npolymers (MIPs). However, it is\nlikely that they will split up into two\nteams so that they can experiment\non both MIPs and enzyme-based\nsensors.\nThe team will be travelling\nto Eindhoven University of\ntechnology in the Netherlands on\nthe 9th\nof September to present their\nsensor. Each sensor will be given\n22 samples to be tested over three\nhours on Friday and on Saturday,\nthe team will present their sensor\nto the public and a panel of experts,\nProfessor Cass being one of them.\nFour independent awards will be\ngiven out by the end of Saturday:\nThe Analytical Performance Award,\nbased on the precision, range, speed\nand sample volume; The Creativity\nand Initiative Award, based on\nhow original the sensor is; The\nTranslation Potential Award, based\non future applications in healthcare\nand how cost-effective it is; and The\nPublic Presentation Award, based\non the presentation skills of the\nteams.\nWhile it would be an amazing\nachievement for the team to win\nan award, they are simply happy to\nhave made a functioning sensor and\ncontributed to the scientific field.\nTo follow the team's progress,\nlike them on Facebook or visit their\nwebsite: imperialcollege.sensus.org.\nJohn Welsh\nWriter\n\n"

Photo Credit: Al Jazeera\nI\nt\u2019s like that old saying goes,\n\u2018you wait for one anti-semitism\nscandal, and then three come\nalong at once\u2019. First was\nthe election of Malia Bouattia as\nNUS president, whose labelling of\nBirmingham as a Zionist outpost\nwas quite problematic, then came\nthe four-year-old posts of MP\nNaz Shah saying that the people\nof Israel should be relocated to\nAmerica (okay, more than a little\nmore problematic). Finally, the nail\nin the coffin for the Labour party\u2019s\nanti-semitism problem, the former\nMayor of London compared the\nintentions of Israel to that of Hitler.\nWell.That is very problematic.\nThis has led to calls for Jeremy\nCorbyn to address the \u201crife antisemitism\u201d within his party, and\nindeed the left as a whole. Okay, so\nhow do I say this? Ken Livingstone\nwas completely wrong, Naz Shah\nposted things that should not have\nbeen posted, but maybe, just maybe,\nnot being a fan of the state of Israel\nis not anti-semitic, and has more\nto do with distaste for its foreign\npolicy and the 50 year occupation\nthan for Jewish people?\nIsrael\ncontinues\nto get away\nwith the\nhuman\nrights\nviolations it\ncommits\nOne of the principal problems is\nthat the term \u2018Zionist\u2019 carries the\nbaggage of centuries of anti-semitic\nsentiment in the form of the belief\nthat Jewish people are part of some\nshadowy organisation that controls\nthe world from behind the scenes \u2013\nobviously this belief is anti-semitic\nand a hokey conspiracy theory.\nIt should also be acknowledged\nthat the idea that Jewish spiritual,\ncultural,and political identity resides\nin the land they were forced out of\n\u2013 and indeed the idea of creating a\nstate to unite the Jewish people \u2013\nwas in response to the continuous\npersecution of the Jewish people.\nMy issue comes with the fact\nthat these anti-semitic allegations\nmay soon become shorthand for\nany accusations towards the state\nof Israel, thus denouncing any\nconstructive discussion on foreign\npolicy. Ken Livingstone\u2019s statement\ncomparing Israel\u2019s motivations to\nthose of Hitler was the headline-grabbing statement; however, the\nrest of his statement was this: \u201cThe\nsimple fact in all of this is that Naz\nmade these comments at a time\nwhen there was another brutal\nIsraeli attack on the Palestinians\u201d.\nIt is my personal opinion, and\nthat posed by the three figures\nmentioned in the first paragraph,\nthat the State of Israel continues\nto get away with human rights\nviolations that it commits in the\nname of self-defence in the 21st\ncentury.\nHere is a quick rundown of those\ncommitted in the last 12 months,\naccording to Human Rights Watch\nor Amnesty International: In a\nreport published in April 2016,\nit was found that the number of\nPalestinian children arrested and\ndetained along the West Bank had\ndoubled since October, defying\ninternational laws that dictate a\nparent or guardian must be present,\nand this came along with reports of\nchild abuse by the Israeli security\nservice towards these children.\nIn March 2016, it emerged that\nAbd al-Fatah al-Sharif, who was\nalleged to have stabbed an Israeli\nsoldier, was executed with an assault\nrifle after being wounded. This has\nbeen re-ordered and a legal case to\nprosecute the soldier in question for\nwar crimes continues; however, the\nIn defence of ales\nAles are heavenly elixirs that\ndon\u2019t need to be cold and fizzy\nto taste wonderful\nJian Li Chew\nWriter\nLike me, you can enjoy classy beverages like this. Photo Credit: Brewdog\nE\nvery Friday I pick up a\ncopy of FELIX to glance\nat the headline, look at\nthe centrefold to see if\nI recognise anyone in it, quietly\ncomplain to myself that my halfhearted attempts at developing a\nsix-pack have yet to succeed, read\nHangman, lament the fact that\nit's only one page long, and amuse\nmyself with the idea of running for\nFELIX Editor just to convert the\nwhole damn thing into 32 pages of\nHangman 4 teh lulz (note to Grace,\nI\u2019m not actually seriously going to\ndo it).\nWhich is why when, this time,\nI actually flipped through what\nthe cat brought in, I saw a picture\nof four beautiful, cold, gleaming\nchalices of my favourite alcoholic\ndrink on Earth, and got deflated by\ndear Pietro\u2019s lengthy denunciation\nof it. Now, if I were not wizened\nby the deep, harrowing abyss that\nis the 9Gag comment section, I\u2019d\nhave screamed out \u201cI\u2019m offended!\u201d,\nto which my roommate would\nhave said \u201cHi offended, I\u2019m Dad\u201d.\nInstead, I accept his concession to\naccept people who love ales, but\nHeavenly\nexquisite\nelixir\nbrewed by\nangels and\nunicorns\nthen, I\u2019m bored out of my wits and\nam looking for something to divert\nme from cold, hard reality.\nNow some of you may wonder\nwhy I\u2019m doing this. Why are you\npicking a fight for no reason and\nbelabouring a dumb, moot point?\nTo which I reply that I descend from\na family in which my father met\nmy mother when he gatecrashed a\nwedding my mother was attending,\nand one in which my mother\npranked her colleague by telling\nher that a certain Ms Lyon was\nasking for her, and gave her a phone\nnumber to call, which turned out to\nbe the Zoo.\nIn complete disagreement with\nmy dear Pietro, I believe that ale is\nthe most heavenly exquisite elixir\nbrewed by angels and unicorns.\nBeing unable to rely on being ice\ncold or fizzy like lager in order to\nactually taste good, it tastes good\non its own merit. Every wholesome,\nrich, textured drop is a delight to\nthe senses, and, being heavy, I feel\nlike I\u2019m having a real, proper drink\nwhich feels like a full meal instead\nof the bad lager, which, devoid of\nall content, serves only to get you\nwasted. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like\nlager. Hoegarden, Carling, Tsingtao\nand London Lager (the yellow tap\nat Eastside) are definite beauts,\nand I can swallow down Carlsberg,\nHeineken and Stella anyday, but\nales are in a whole different league.\nComing from a country where the\nlocal alcoholic scene consists of the\nworld\u2019s second highest alcohol tax\nafter Norway, a piteous selection\nof lagers (Carlsberg, Heineken,\nTiger and not much else), a large\npopulation of teetotallers and social\ndisapproval, the UK is a dream! I\u2019d\nnever seen more than five taps at a\nbar before (granted I don\u2019t go out\nmuch).\nAs a history and trivia buff, I\nknow that ale is the traditional type\nof beer that was drunk all over the\nworld before a new type of yeast was\nintroduced,giving rise to lagers.This\nwas the stuff the ancient Egyptians\ndrank, and which your ancestors\nprobably drank (But not mine.\nMine drank tea), and when the time\ncame for everything to change, the\nBritish, in a quintessentially British\nmove, decided to stay out of it.\nOn your point about how ale ruins\nnights out, I respectfully disagree,\nit\u2019s the only thing that allows me to\ngo on nights out. Beer is about the\nonly alcoholic drink I can tolerate\nbefore my alcohol flush kicks in and\nturns my face redder than the on\nmy first date. It\u2019s the only alcoholic\ndrink that tastes good on its own. I\nmean if vodka tasted good instead\nof potato juice with a strong hint\nof industrial solvent, you wouldn\u2019t\nneed to mix it in with coke to hide\nthe taste. Also, I can\u2019t afford whisky\nand good wine, and I don\u2019t dare try\nthe hard liquor China passes off as\nbeer (Moutai, anyone?).\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on craft\nbeers. Don\u2019t you denounce craft\nbeers! They\u2019re the one thing that\nrescued the American beer industry\nby flooding it with actual, quality\nbeverages. You, in your spirited\nAlso, I\ncan\u2019t afford\nwhisky and\ngood wine\nsnobbery (pun fully intended)\nhave failed to see the multitudes\nof American beer lovers who hail\ntheir rescue from the clutches of\nBudweiser, Coors, and Miller which\nthey had to gulp down for decades\nwith tears in their eyes. It is the\npassionate, can-do, experimental\nattitude of brewers who made\nAmerica great again, in the hard\nwork, value-adding type of way, not\nin the build a wall and encourage\nxenophobic racism while waving\nyour tiny orange hands kind of way.\nIn short,we get it Pietro.You don\u2019t\nlike ales, its fine, but you don\u2019t need\nto rub it in everyone\u2019s faces.But,as a\nMalaysian speaking to an Italian, let\nme extend an olive branch of peace,\nand while we can agree to disagree\non ales, we can both agree on two\nvery important points. English food\nis boring, and Budweiser tastes\nabsolutely disgusting.\nIsraeli forces rarely prosecute any of\ntheir soldiers accused of war crimes.\nFinally, the Israel Defence Forces\n(IDF) launched an aerial offensive\nin Gaza on July 8th, followed by a\nground offensive on July 17th. The\nUN has identified 538 children\namong the 1563 Palestinian\ncivilians killed.\nIt is also worth noting that\nPalestine is not an entirely passive\ncountry \u2013 there are frequent suicide\nbombings and stabbings which are\nattributed to Hamas, meaning they\nare not blameless in the conflict.\nTo any normal person, the\nvocalisation of objections to the\nmurder of children and the violation\nof human rights should be able to\nbe placed in a public forum without\nfear of being labelled as either racist\nor anti-semitic, two of the worst\nthings I could ever imagine being\ncalled.\nEqually, politicians must be able\nto voice valid criticisms of Israel,\nfor they are supposedly the ones\nthat could enact some change,\nmake them criminalise torture, hold\nthose responsible for committing\nwar crimes accountable. However,\nif every time we try to have a\nconstructive conversation about\nIsrael it is shut down by either\noffensive racial slurs or a reluctance\nto criticise, then what\u2019s the point?\nPoliticians\nmust be\nable to\nvoice valid\ncriticisms of\nIsrael\n\n"

The Boy\nin the Striped Pyjamas comes to\nmind, where everything \u2013 from the\neuphoric music, to the dialogue,\nright down to the nuanced acting \u2013\nis engineered in order to profit from\nan emotional response from the\naudience, the cynical possibility of\nan Oscar hanging somewhere in the\nnear future. In the end, these films\nseem to almost trivialise the topic\nof the Holocaust, and while their\naims may be noble, this method\nlacks emotional subtlety and creates\na work with the feeling of emotional\nartifice. You may have guessed that\nSon of Saul is the complete antithesis\nof this. It is a piece of art that will\nendure years to come, not just this\npast Oscar\u2019s season.\nThe first indicator that this is\nuniqueisthecamerawork:rightfrom\nthe opening, where titular character\nSaul Ausl\u00e4nder (G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig)\ndiscovers a young boy murdered in\nthe gas chambers, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Erd\u00e9ly\u2019s\n35mm cinematography focuses\ndirectly on the face of Saul, whose\neyes sit dark and deep in his skull,\nrevealing the pain he has up to this\npoint endured and continues to\nendure as the film progresses.\nThroughout the film we rarely\nglimpse anything further away than\na couple of meters from Saul\u2019s face,\nand director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes shows\nincredible constraint and vision\nto resist capturing the production\nvalues or showing the violent\natrocities that occur as he performs\nthe tasks forced upon him as a\nmember of the Sonderkommando\n(prisoner work units at death camps,\nmade to assist the functioning of\nthe gas chambers) such as in the\nopening scene where he is collecting\nthe clothes of murdered Jews. The\nfilm follows Saul as he continues in\nhis attempt to bury the child, who\nmay or not be his son.\nTo tell this story, we go through\nhell on earth, focusing on the\npersonal pain reflected in G\u00e9za\nR\u00f6hrig\u2019s face \u2013 the use of a 40mm\nlens creates a claustrophobically\nshallow depth of field that keeps\nmost of the nudity and murder\nout of focus. Reinforcing this is\nthe decision to project the film in\nthe academy ratio, with the near-square image further adding to the\noppressive atmosphere.\nAdditional credit must be given to\nTam\u00e1s Z\u00e1yni whose sound design\ncreates the world that is kept out of\nsight: the screams of the people who\nrealise what their fate, the furnaces\nin which the bodies are burnt \u2013 all\nlocations are given such horrifying\nsound design that it is impossible\nnot to imagine what occurs just\nbeyond the frame, adding to the\nimmersion created by Nemes.\nSon of Saul is edited phenomenally\nby Matthieu Taponier, who creates\nsuch a tense pace that there is never a\nmoment in which the film becomes\nportentous. Rather, Saul\u2019s singular\ntask of burying his son whilst in the\nmidst of a hellish atrocity becomes a\nthrilling 107 minutes of cinema.\nOf course, none of this would\nmatterunlessR\u00f6hrighadtheabilities\nto carry the film. He undoubtedly\nhas such abilities. The essential\ndifference between film acting and\ntheatrical acting is the minutia,\nsomething R\u00f6hrig completely\nunderstands: each grimace and\nlook transcends whatever subtitles\nflash at the bottom of the screen,\nand in numerous profile shots he\nseems to stare into the very soul of\nG\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig brings incredible intensity to Son of Saul, described by Shoah director Claude Lanzmann as the \u2018anti-Schindler\u2019s List\u2019.

In one particular shot\nwe see a smile slowly unfold upon\nhis face \u2013 it is shocking how simple\nan image has stuck with me all of\nthis week, and a testament to the\nsubtlety and mastery of R\u00f6hrig\u2019s\ncraft.\nAlthough this is a film\nabout a Sonderkommando in a\nconcentration camp, it would be\na mistake to label this as just a\nHolocaust drama; indeed, like all\nbest stories it seeks to transpose a\nfamiliar human experience into the\nsetting of an unfamiliar landscape.\nIt is a story about how, in the\ndarkest times, the ache to embrace\ntraditions and to cling to them is\none of the most basic human traits\nthat exists. Whilst Saul and his\ncompatriots are treated as nothing\nmore than animals, the traditional\nburial that he seeks for his son is\na goal that drives him to afford his\nson one last shred of humanity in\nan environment where this has been\ntaken from them.\nSon of Saul is an experience like\nno other. Yes, it is oppressively dark\n(for obvious reasons), and yes, it\nwill haunt you. But it is a cinematic\nexperience like no other \u2013 one of\nthe most brutal depictions of the\nHolocaust ever committed to film,\nand one that should be experienced\nin the cinema.\nSon of Saul\nDir: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes.

I\u2019m just saying. The only\nway to stop this is to not give their\nbloated superhero film franchise\nany more money. Here are some\nalternatives:\nWatchmen (2009)\nBased on the graphic novel\nof the same name by eccentric\ngenius Alan Moore, Watchmen\ndemonstrates that Zac Snyder is at\nleast somewhat capable of making\na decent superhero film, despite\nwhat his most recent offering might\nsuggest. Despite condemnation\nfrom Moore himself (unsurprising,\nhe hates all adaptions of his books)\nWatchmen actually manages to hold\nup. It\u2019s not perfect \u2013 or as clever\nas the book \u2013 but its surprising\nfaithfulness to the source material\nand gorgeous aesthetics make it a\nfitting complement.\nHellboy (2004)\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Hellboy was\nmy unchallenged favourite film in\nprimary school. It\u2019s not your typical\nsuperhero film, but its unique\n\u2018del Toro\u2019 nature is what makes it\nstand out. Today, I consider both\nthe original and its sequel two of\nthe most underrated cult classics\nof all time. I promise this isn\u2019t just\nnostalgia speaking\u2026 Ok maybe it is\na bit.\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\nI don\u2019t know why, but it feels a\nbit weird putting this film on the\nlist. Everybody raves about it so\nmuch that a lot of people are bored\nof hearing about it. On the other\nhand, including it makes my job\neasier because I don\u2019t need to do any\nconvincing. The Dark Knight is one\nof the best films ever. Go watch it\nagain.\nBEN COLLIER\nT\nhe struggle between\ngood and evil \u2013\nbetween superheroes\nand supervillains \u2013 has\nremained at the centre of the\nMarvel Cinematic Universe (and\nblockbusters in general) since its\ninception in 2008\u2019s Iron Man.\nWithout exception, the antagonists\nof the eleven following Marvel films\nhave always represented the worst\nof humanity (or super-humanity),\nand the protagonists, while often\ntroubled, are always redeemable.\nIn this marketing-driven universe\nthere is rarely space for moral\nambiguity. The third film in the\nCaptain America trilogy, Captain\nAmerica: Civil War, escapes this\nmold by pitting hero against hero in\na \u2018war\u2019over the controversial Sokovia\nAccords which hope to establish an\ninternational body to govern and\nmonitor superhuman activity.\nThe online marketing leading up\nthe release of the film asked fans\nto decide whether they supported\n#TeamCap or #TeamIronMan,\nwhile posters had the two leaders\nposed against each other, with their\nsupporters in the background. But\nunlike the marketing campaign,\nCaptain America: Civil War\nDir: Joe Russo, Anthonay Russo.\nScript: Christoper Markus, Stephen\nMcFeely. Starring: Chris Evans,\nRobert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan,\nScarlett Johansson. 147 minutes.\nthe conflict the film presents is far\nmore complex: in 147 minutes of\nsuperhero action and confrontation,\ndirectors Anthony and Joe Russo\nrepeatedly challenge their audience\u2019s\nunderstanding of vigilantism and\nthe unintended destruction that\ninvariably follows, presenting us\nwith flashbacks to the Avengers\u2019\ncareless destruction in previous\nfilms.Like its comic source material,\nCivil War is an allegory for military\nintervention and war, and the\nworrying lack of oversight that often\nleads to death. Captain America\n(Chris Evans) is a character that\nhas witnessed first-hand the evil\nof the Nazis and Hydra, whereas\nIron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has\nseen how Western intervention and\nhis own weapons sales can support\nand create terror. It is these two\nopposing experiences and views\nthat go head to head in Civil\nWar, verbally as well as physically,\nthrough a number of key character\nconversations. Viewers who have\nwatched from the beginning of\nthe series, and those that have any\nunderstanding of history, are likely\nto enter the theatre with a range\nof opinions \u2013 but ultimately Civil\nWar never validates or invalidates\nany of these. It\u2019s final message is\nambiguous.\nThe film\u2019s best trait is possibly\nthe success with which it juggles\nits massive ensemble cast (the\ncumulative result of a dozen\nfilms). Veteran Avengers are given\nthe majority of the screen time,\nalthough newcomers Black Panther\n(Chadwick Boseman) and SpiderMan (Tom Holland) are given fairly\nlengthy introductions, and both\noffer a refreshing variety to the cast\nthat goes beyond mere marketing\ntools for future films (Marvel\u2019s Black\nPanther is set to be released in 2018\nand Spider-Man: Homecoming in\n2017). But with such a large cast\nthere is rarely time for character\ndevelopment,and we are never given\nan insight into how years of fighting\nand unintended civilian casualties\nhave affected the emotional state of\nthe team \u2013 other than a few tears,\nCaptain America and his crew seem\nlargely unaffected. The film does\nhave the advantage of developing its\ncharacters over the many adventures\nthat have preceded it and Civil War\nis very much the culmination of\nthese storylines, but without the\ncontext of previous films some parts\nof Civil War are confusing, often\nnothing more than fan-service.\nMany critics noted the excellent\naction scenes of the last Captain\nAmerica and they return on a larger\nand more ambitious scale. Each\npunch and kick of close combat is\ndelivered with crunching realism.\nThe larger battles, including one\nthat lasts over 20 minutes, use a\nmixture of fantastical special effects\nand witty one-liners to deliver some\nof the best action audiences will\nhave ever seen in a comic book film.\nHowever, the large cast can cause\nconfusion; it\u2019s often hard to discern\nwho is on what side in the frenzy\nof battle.\nWhile easily forgiven, the film\u2019s\nsoundtrack is largely forgettable\ncompared to other recent superhero\nfilms like Deadpool or any of\nDC\u2019s output, and similarly the\ncinematography is never more than\nserviceable. You would hope that a\nfilm with such a large budget and\naudience might attract someone\nwith more interesting talent. While\nI would argue that comic books,and\nby extension comic book movies,\nhave never been about the scenery\nin which they place their characters,\nbut that doesn\u2019t forgive the lack of\neffort. Artists pour most of their\ntime into designing lavish, eye-catching costumes, and the outfits\nof Civil War are suitably refined,\nwith new members of the ensemble\ngiven a large amount of focus.These\ncostumes are often as much a part\nof the film as the actors themselves,\nand the new set of heroes on offer\nwill create new fans and ample\nopportunity for merchandise and\nproduct placement in the future.\nIn Civil War, the vastness of the\ncomic book canon is exploited to\nfull effect, with the best comic book\nmoments from decades of source\nmaterial composed together in a\ntruly unforgettable blockbuster.\nIt reflects the richness of the\ncomic book medium: the endless\nreinvention, massive crossovers, and\never-increasing spectacle. Captain\nAmerica: Civil War rewards fans for\ntheir dedication, offering the best\nMarvel film to date.\nCALE TILFORD\nThings get emosh in the latest of the ten billion Marvel films scheduled to come out this year.

Gathered outside SAF at\nthe ungodly hour of 5:45am, some\nquick Imperial brains spotted that\nthere were actually only sixteen\nrecruits present;we were missing our\nsecret weapon, scholarship athlete\nAlistair Wallace. A few panicked\nphone calls later and it became clear\nthat he had slept through his alarm\nand was not going to make the\nrendez-vous. We departed one man\ndown, hoping that he would be able\nto make his own way to the race.\nThe rest of the journey went\nsmoothly, even those in the bus\ndriven by Jonny \u201cfast and furious\u201d\nSingh survived their trip relatively\nunscathed. Once we had arrived\nin Calne, the plan was simple. The\n500 odd student triathletes would\nbe set off in half hour waves, with\nthe slowest swimmers starting first.\nThey would then complete a 750m\nswim, 25km bike and 5km run as\nquickly as possible.\nMatt Douthwaite and club\ncaptain Sam Jackson fearlessly led\nthe march into battle, setting off in\nthe first wave of the day. Despite\nconcerns from Luis, the TriIC swim\ncoach, about Matt\u2019s abilities in the\npool, this runner-turned-triathlete\nput in a solid performance and\nwas the first of the two out of the\npool. Once on dry land, Matt found\nhimself in much more familiar\nterritory, storming the bike and\nrun to finish second in his wave\nwith Imperial\u2019s fastest run time\nof the day. Meanwhile Sam was\nhaving a slightly more eventful\nrace. His super quick first transition\nturned out to be more hasty than\nspeedy as he realised part way into\nthe bike that he had failed to attach\nhis race number. Whilst zooming\npast the marshals, hoping they\nwouldn\u2019t notice this omission, an\nunfortunately placed speed bump\nrelieved the captain of his water\nbottle as it flew out of his bottle\ncage on to the other side of the\nroad. No longer weighed down by\nthese unnecessary pieces of kit, Sam\nput in decent bike and run times to\nfinish solidly overall.\nNext up were Lawrence Tse and\nJohn Foden-Shroff competing in\nwave number two. As some of the\nfew Imperial athletes to have already\ncompeted in triathlons, Lawrence\nand John managed to complete\ntheir races with no mishaps, both\nfinishing with highly respectable\noverall times.\nThese two were followed by the\nthird wave of Imperial triathletes\nincluding Jonny Singh who had\nsomehow managed to find himself\nsetting off at the same time as\nhalf the Imperial women\u2019s squad.\nHe quickly overtook teammate\nLily Battershill in the pool before\nputting in the fastest Imperial bike\ntime of the day to finish fourth out\nof the Imperial men.\nSadly Lily\u2019s race didn\u2019t go quite as\nsmoothly. In the pool, the wayward\nfoot of a fellow (non-Imperial)\ncompetitor connected with her\ngoggles to leave her with a shiny\nblack eye. She bravely soldiered on\nto the bike, her strongest discipline.\nSadly, about halfway round the\ncourse, she experienced a race-stopping puncture. After a teary\ntwenty minutes spent sat by the\nside of the road, she was rescued by\nsome passing cyclists who kindly\npatched up her wheel and set her\non her way. She was massively\ndisappointed by this turn of events\nbut eventually cheered up, especially\nafter disappearing for a short time\nin the afternoon to be consoled by\nteam mate Jonny.\nLeanne Lyons and Anna Lawson\nwere having much more successful\nraces. Having recently joined\nthe triathlon club from running\nbackgrounds, they both put in\ndecent times on the swim and\nbike but excelled on the run, each\ncompleting the 5km in under 23\nminutes, no mean feat after having\nalready been racing for over an hour!\nThe next Imperial triathletes to\nset off were Edmund Jones, Alice\nSpencer and Madeleine Whybrow.\nEd was the first of the three to\nleave the pool but fell into a spot\nof misfortune when one of his\naero bars fell off part way into the\nbike, leaving him with a lopsided\naero position and very odd looking\nhandlebars. Not letting this faze\nhim, he completed a solid bike and\nrun time to finish fifth out of the\nImperial men.\nNext to finish in the pool was\nAlice but sadly her speedy swim\nwas not matched by the rest of\nher race where she was left a little\ndisappointed by her bike and run.\nLast but not least,Madeleine left the\npool, keen to put the swim behind\nher to get on with her beloved bike.\nTrue to form, she put down the\nfastest bike time of the Imperial\nwomen finishing solidly overall.The\nnext Imperial athlete to compete\nwas Marcel Admiraal, swimming\nin a wave on his own. This was his\nfourth BUCS Sprint Triathlon and\nhis experience served him well as\nhe completed a great race, scoring a\npersonal best in the process.\nThesixthwavecontainingImperial\ncompetitors set off at midday and\nfeatured Greg Jones and Freya Espir.\nDespite being a very inexperienced\ncyclist, Greg absolutely stormed all\nthree legs of the race, with notably\nquick swim and run times. His bike\nwent less smoothly, however, as he\nspent the first couple of kilometres\nworking out how to change down\na gear before taking a tumble after\nan unfortunate encounter with a\nroundabout at high speed. Despite\nthese upsets, he still put down a\ngreat time, finishing third out of the\nImperial men.\nFreya was having even more\ntrouble in her race. Slipping on a\ncorner on her way out of the pool,she\nstarted the bike with a few injuries\nbut carried on regardless. However,\na missed turning and some dubious\ndirections from a marshal saw Freya\ncomplete an extra 5km on the bike.\nImpressively, she completed the rest\nof the race although was obviously\na little disappointed with her time!\nUp next was next year\u2019s captain\nand resident French heart-throb\nTom Bartissol. Despite a slow\nsecond transition, during which\nit took him several attempts to\ncomplete the usually simple task of\nputting shoes on,Tom\u2019s overall time\nwas very impressive and he placed\na strong second out of the Imperial\nmen.\nLast but not least,Alistair Wallace\nand Jessica Prior were racing in\none of the final waves of the day.\nBorrowed from the swimming club\nfor the weekend, Jess turned out to\nbe the true star of the day. Both\nher run and swim were the fastest\nof all the Imperial girls. However,\neven more impressive was her bike.\nDespite it being the longest distance\nthat she had ever cycled, she\nsmashed the 25km, beating most of\nher teammates and bringing in the\nfastest overall time of the Imperial\nwomen. For Alastair,however,most\nof the drama had taken place before\nhe had even reached the start line.\nAfter missing the first checkpoint,\nthe experienced triathlete had\ntravelled to Wiltshire via train, bus\nand taxi. All had gone smoothly\nuntil he reached Calne, where he\nrealised that he had left his bike on\nthe train. After some negotiations\nwith the train company,his bike was\non its way back to London and he\nwas paired up with one of the club\nbikes for the race.He went on to put\ndown strong swim and run times,\nearning him a solid first place out of\nthe Imperial athletes.\nOverall, the day saw some\npromising performances from\na mostly inexperienced squad.\nThe team triumphed despite the\n(numerous) mishaps and we are\nalready looking forward to the rest of\nthe triathlon season and the chance\nto learn from our mistakes and to\nimprove on our performances.\nHe spent the\nfirst couple\nof kilometres\nworking\nout how\nto change\ndown a gear\nMaddy Whybrow\nWriter\nQuick get a parking space.

Countless attempts\nhave been made in the past\nto expose various aspects of this\n\u2018Church\u2019 in the past \u2013 discussing its\nhistory or telling the stories of those\nwho have left its ranks. Perhaps\nthe most famous documentary\nprior to the release of Going Clear:\nScientology and the Prison of Belief\nwas the BBC Panorama\u2019s Scientology\nand Me. You\u2019ve probably seen the\nclip from this programme wherein\nthe host, John Sweeney, explodes\nat church member Tommy Davis,\nwho managed to finally get under\nhis skin following months of\nharassment. This is, unfortunately,\nthe usual way these documentaries\ngo: any journalist who has ever\ntried to independently combat\nand expose Scientology is quickly\nmet with stalking, harassment,\nand lawsuits \u2013 some Scientology\nmembers have even gone so far\nas to plant child pornography on\nreporters\u2019 computers. Where the\nHBO special Going Clear stands\nout \u2013 other than the incredible level\nof detail it goes into \u2013 is that it\u2019s\nquite hands-off. The presenter, Alex\nGibney, gives us his message almost\nexclusively through the voices of\n(very) high-ranking ex-members of\nthe church, such as Mike Rinder. I\nthink the backing of the behemoth\nthat is HBO had some part to play\nin the fearlessness with which this\ndocumentary tackles its subject.\nUltimately, Going Clear really\ndoes serve as the only scientology\ndocumentary you\u2019d need to watch\nto get a full understanding of the\nmovement.\nAlmost nothing is left out here:\nwe learn about Scientology\u2019s history,\nget a suitably in-depth exploration\nof the mind of founder L. Ron\nHubbard, a revealing of its shady\nunderbelly, and even a study of\nthe two celebrity stars of the show,\nJohn Travolta and Tom Cruise. A\nfocus on these two celebrities may\nsound somewhat pointless at first,\nbut throughout the course of the\nfilm one does begin to understand\nthe monumental impact they had\non popularising the church. Tom\nCruise in particular comes across\nas an egotistical, Patrick Batemanesque character \u2013 he is very\nchummy with the current leader\nDavid Miscavige, a Machiavellian\nfigure who seems to be focused on\nmassaging Cruise\u2019s ego in order\nto keep him brainwashed and\ndedicated. Based on the archive\nfootage, it\u2019s possible to draw a\nlot of parallels between Cruise\nand Kim Jong-un: both appear\nto be man-children surrounded\nby insincere admirers, convinced\nof their own self-importance. For\nother celebrities involved in the\nmovement, one almost gets the\nidea that they are trapped, possibly\nblackmailed using the information\nfrom their confessional \u2018auditing\u2019\nsessions.

Photo Eddie Yip\nHalley\u2019s Comet, a ball of ice and\nrock left over from the creation\nof the Milky Way, only makes an\nappearance every 75 years, so sadly\nwe have to wait until 2061 before we\nget another glimpse of it. However,\nwe are in the midst of meteor\nshower.Earth is twirling though the\ntail of Halley\u2019s Comet. Therefore, it\nis inevitable that tiny debris falling\ninto our atmosphere will burn up\nleading to a month-long annual\nspectacle called Eta Aquarids.\nLucky stargazers in the southern\nhemisphere will witness 30-40\nmeteors flying through the night\nsky per hour whereas the northern\nstargazers will see 10-20. The best\ntime to view this spectacle is in early\nhours of morning before twilight,\n5th\n- 7th\nMay. A dark remote spot\naway from light pollution is a better\nplace to witness the shower but you\nwon\u2019t need any fancy astrophysics\nequipment if you decide to. Don\u2019t\nworry if you miss it this time as late\nOctober will provides the Orionid\nmeteor shower.\nAt Sh!t Sc!ience, we believe that\nall science, no matter how stupid it\nsounds, has a purpose and adds to\nthe sum of human knowledge. This\nweek: the science of gingerness.\nYou\u2019ll have seen this story. From\nPrince Harry to Julianne Moore,\nthe honorary heads of the ginger\ncommittee are strewn across the\nmost reputable science sections.\nThe reason? Ice cold revenge! It is\nnow scientifically proven that even\nthough you are growing older and\nsaggier by the minute (yes...you\nare), redheads are more likely to\nremain as baby-faced as when you\nwere making fun of them in school.\nWell\u2026 they look a bit younger.\nWell\u2026 by two years. Maybe not\nthe greatest payback for years of\nmockery.\nThe study behind the finding\nwas published this week by a team\nof scientists from the Erasmus\nUniversity. After asking people\nto estimate the age of the 2693\nmembers of their cohort based\nMoney can\u2019t buy this pale, creamy baby-face babes. Photo Credit Noodles\nand Beef\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nThe key to eternal youth is being ginger... kind of\nsolely on pictures of their faces,\nthe scientists cross-referenced the\n\u2018perceived age\u2019 with differences\nin their cohort\u2019s genotypes. They\nfound one gene that could be\nassociated with youthful looks,\nthe MC1R gene. This gene codes\nfor the melanocortin1 receptor, a\nprotein which regulates the ratio\nof pheomelanin (a blond or red\npigment) to eumelanin (a brown\nor black pigment), which gives\nhair its shading. The youthful look\nwas associated with a particular\nvariation of the MC1R gene.\nThese gene variant codes for a\nmelanocortin1 receptor, which in\nturn produces very little eumelanin,\nand is subsequently associated with\nred hair. And there you have it, red\nhair is linked to youthful looks.\n\u2018That\u2019s it?\u2019, I hear you cry? \u2018All that\ngenetic encoding and screening for\nthat?\u2019 I agree, but as always, this\nstudy actually represents a tiny step\nin a much bigger endeavour. While\nthe first genome took 13 years to\nsequence, an entire human\ngenome can now be sequenced\nin days.This staggering progress\nhas encouraged the hope that\nthrough the reading of our\ngenomes, we would finally be\nable to predict and prevent\ndisease. Programs such as the\nRotterdam study, the Leiden\nLongevity study and the Twins\nUK studies, have provided\nhuge repositories of thousands\nof genomes. This information\nallows us to filter through\nmillions of bytes of data to\nlook for the elusive genes\nthat could be responsible for\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, the genetic\nmalformation which causes the\nterrible Parkinson\u2019s disease, and\nalso the gene that makes us look\nyounger when we\u2019re not. That is\nthe power of Big Data, and we\nshould expect to see many more\nof these studies in the coming\nyears.\nScience, what\u2019s good?\nWhere would you store your data?\nMagnetic tapes? Hard drives? What\nabout DNA? It is possible to store\nand retrieve, say, 10,000 GB worth\nof data in a tiny pink DNA smear\nat the end of a test tube. DNA\nstores data in a code of A,T,C and\nGs. Computers store data in a digit\ncode of 0s and 1s. If you produce\nnucleotide strands in the lab,\ncombinations can then be developed\nto produce a code standing for\nletters, numbers or other digital\ninformation, combining these two\nlanguages. This allows compacting\nof information to a smaller degree\never artificially achieved with\nhuman technological developments.\nIn addition DNA can protect the\ndata, which can remain unchanged\nfor thousands of years. Scientists\ncan even employ PCR techniques\nto produce large quantities of DNA\nstrands increasing the chance that\nthe DNA strand picked contains the\ninformation we want. The future of\nstorage is here and it\u2019s genetic.\nBornholt et al. 2016 @ Association\nfor Computing Machinery\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\nWhen we consider the impact of\nclimate change on our oceans, we\noften think of overfishing or coral\nbleaching. People rarely consider\nthe impacts on drifting planktonic\nspecies, invisible to the human eye.\nTheir lack of observability should,\nhowever, not lead to disregarding\ntheir importance. Drifting plankton\ncomprise the oceans \u201clungs\u201d, and\nsupport fisheries across the globe.\nScientists at the University of\nTechnology, in Sydney Australia,\nand Imperial College London\nhave been modelling how such\nplankton drift along the ocean\ncurrents to understand the impact\nof climate change on these species.\nAs plankton hitch a ride on ocean\ncurrents, they\u2019re often subjected to\ntemperature changes of up to 10\n\u00b0C. These exposures to various\ntemperature changes are thought\nto play a role in how plankton may\nrespond to climate changes. So any\nprevious studies will probably need\nto re-evaluate their predictions\ntake into account these effects.\nDoblin et al. 2016 @ PNAS\nDNA as data\nstorage unit\nPlankton hitch\nhikes currents\nWhen it comes to the best\ntreatments available for autism,\nearly intervention is key. Despite\nthis, autism in most children is\nnot diagnosed until they\u2019re four\nyears of age, when challenges in\ncommunication, social disabilities,\nand repetitive behaviour patterns\nbecome apparent. Researchers at\nUT Southwestern medical centre\nhave recently identified an Autism\nSpectrum Disorder (ASD) blood\nbiomarker, which allows early\nidentification with an accuracy of\nup to 80%. They found that boys\nwith the disorder had significantly\nreduced levels of the igG1 antibody.\nThe 25 peptide compounds that\nbind to igG1 serum protein were\nthen analysed, and one was isolated,\nnow identified as ASD1, which\ncould diagnose the disorder with a\n66% accuracy. Combining ASD1\nwith measures of thyroid stimulating\nhormone levels subsequently\nincreased accuracy of identification\nto 73%.However,more testing must\nbe carried out for further validation.\nDeng et al. 2016 @ Scientific\nreports\nForget road rage, what about\nair rage? As flying is becoming\nmore and more frequent for many,\nit is important we understand\nwhat gets us so hot and bothered\nunder our seatbelt. Long queues,\ndelayed flights, little leg room are\nonly a few of the inconveniences\nthat drive up our cortisol levels.\nHowever, new research conducted\nby Katy Decelles at the University\nof Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of\nManagement and Micheal Norton\nof the Harvard Business School\nfound that air rage is more likely\nto occur when the plane has first\nclass seats. Class inequality seems\nto bring out the worst in people.\nThe study didn\u2019t go into depth as\nto why this was the case, however\nprevious research has indicated that\npeople exhibit a decrease in general\nwell-being when they feel they are\ntreated unfairly or unequally. So if\nairlines want to ensure smoother\nflights for their passengers, they\nmay want consider doing away with\nclasses altogether.\nDeCelles et al. 2016 @ PNAS\nNew marker for\nautism found\nAir rage fueled\nby class wars\nP\naradoxically, antibiotics\nare essential for fighting\nbacterial infections, but\nthey also make our bodies\nmore prone to further infection.\nNew research at the University of\nCalifornia is trying to illuminate\nthe paradox. The chain of events\nbegins with antibiotics depleting\nthe \u2018good\u2019 bacteria in our guts.\nThese bacteria are necessary for\nthe breakdown of gut -fibre which\nproduces butyrate, an essential\norganic acid for gut lining cells.\nWith decreased availability of\nbutyrate, the oxygen consumption\nof these cells declines, and thus\noxygen levels in the gut increases.\nThese conditions favour the growth\nof Salmonella. The research links\nlevels of butyrate-producing\nmicrobes to inflammatory bowel\ndisease. Further research is needed\nthough to see if Salmonella is the\nsole culprit.\nByndloss et al. 2016 @ Cell host &\nMicrobe\nThe cost of\nantibiotics\nB\nreakfast this morning got\nme thinking. It merely\ninvolved microwaving\nfrozen bread prior to\nmaking French toast, but the\nnonchalant routine reminded me\nto extol the virtues of frozen food,\nsomething I think many of us tend\nto overlook.\nSadly, the modern consumer is\ninclined to look down on frozen\ngoods. We scoff at the stiff-edged\nbags roughly clumped together in\nthe freezer aisles, associating the\n\u2018less-for-more\u2019 prices with poor\nquality and unnecessary teeth\nbreaking. Truth be told, the lower\nprices are not in any way linked to\npoorer quality.Frozen food is simply\nmuch cheaper to produce and sell\ncompared to its fresh counterparts,\nhence the less hefty price tags.\nA recent study illuminated the\nvery reason why we should resolve\nour issues with anything that\u2019s not\n\u2018fresh and whole\u2019. Food stored at\n-20oC in the freezer compared to\nthat stored at 4-5oC locks in many\nmore key nutrients and antioxidants.\nWe could be doing ourselves a\nworld of good just by freezing more\nseasonal fruit and vegetables this\nway. We enjoy all the nutritional\ngoodness they have to offer without\nhaving to sacrifice any volume.\nNote the word \u2018seasonal\u2019 here.\nFreezing produce that has to go at\nsome point, or tastes better at one\ntime of year than another, will let us\nenjoy all the most desirable flavours\nand textures for as long as we want.\nIt was found that many anthocyanin\nflavonoids (that help protect our\nlivers and decrease blood pressure)\nare preserved for several months in\nfoods such as blueberries. Similarly\nvitamins such as riboflavin (B1) and\nVitamin C are not only successfully\npreserved, but can even be found in\nhigher quantities in frozen foods\nthan in fresh produce.\nBread\u2019s another good example\nhighlighting the value of freezing.\nThis is how it works: Before baking,\nstarch granules in dough are\ngeometrically arranged,but this nice\ngeometry is changed once water is\nadded to the mix and dough is left\nto rise before baking. Starch absorbs\nthe water and the granules take on a\nmore irregular form. They however\nstart to undergo recrystallisation\nafter baking, the cooling process\nallowing the granules to revert back\nto a more regular geometry. The\ncontinuous recrystallization process\nis what contributes to staling, which\nunfortunately occurs much faster in\nthe fridge than if you chuck your\nloaf into the freezer.\nOf course, we still have to be a\nlittle picky. Freezing creates ice\ncrystals, and the more water content\na fruit or vegetable has, the bigger\nthese ice crystals, so it would be\na good idea to leave things like\nmushrooms and lettuce out of the\npicture. Otherwise, most anything\ncan be frozen, including meat, fish,\nbread, and even most aromatic\nspices. Go ahead\u2013 freeze it up!\nEat your frozen veggies kids.

As the\nastronomer and philosopher Carl\nSagan quoted famously, \u201cWe\u2019re\nmade of star stuff.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve used the skies to navigate\nlands and seas, to determine the\nearth is round,to learn about Earth\u2019s\nphysical history\nFor the past few centuries,\nthe development of science and\ntechnology has accelerated our\nunderstanding of the vast unknown\nuniverse, its complex laws and\ninfinite horizons. With the\nabundance of technology in our\nlives we may take it for granted, but\nlanding a man on the moon was\nno easy feat in the 1960\u2019s. So why\nhaven\u2019t we gone back? We answered\nthe call of the sea and promise\nof distant lands, so why have we\nrun back to safety from when we\ndipped our toes in the cold shores\nof the cosmic ocean? We\u2019ve made\nand sent objects into space that\nhave now passed the edge of our\nsolar system \u2013 12 billion miles away,\nbut human exploration has been\nlimited. Certainly there are massive\nchallenges to overcome in advancing\nour technological capacity.\nThe greatest challenge of all\nhowever, is money. In a world\nwhere money is wasted for violent\nobjectives and polluting the delicate\necosystems of our planet; exercising\nour vast intellectual capacity, with\nthe potential to answer the deep\nhuman drive for exploration is\nlargely ignored. In the US alone, the\n2011 military budget was almost\n$200 billion USD higher than the\nentire NASA budget over 53 years\nfrom 1958-2011. It\u2019s disappointing\nthat we are not pressuring our\ngovernments to increase funding for\nthis kind of awe-inspiring research,\nto help us understand more and\nmore clearly our place amongst the\nbeautiful and mysterious bodies of\nthe cosmos.\nNAOMI STEWART\ntechnique which allows the culture\nof \u2018unculturable\u2019 microbes in lab\nconditions.\nSo far less than 10 million species\nof microbes have been classified.\n\u201cOf those catalogued species,\nonly about 10,000 have ever been\ngrown in a lab, and fewer than\n100,000 have classified sequences,\u201d\nLennon said. \u201cOur results show\nthat this leaves 100,000 times more\nmicroorganisms awaiting discovery\n-- and 100 million to be fully\nexplored. Microbial biodiversity,\nit appears, is greater than ever\nimagined.\u201d\nDiatoms are one of the most diverse taxons on Earth. Photo Credit: Picturepest\nestimate said. Indeed in a rapidly\nchanging world undergoing another\nmass extinction, identifying new\nspecies is crucial.\nUncovering diversity on Earth,\nhas been a task many studies have\nattempted. However past estimates\nhave either grossly fallen short\nof the true magnitude of earth\u2019s\ndiversity,or have completely ignored\nmicrobial communities.\nThat\u2019s not to say such approaches\nwere unjustifiable. Naturally\nnumbers of some species are\neasier to calculate than others. For\nexample we know of approximately\n5000 mammal species and the\nlikelihood of there being a large\nhidden repository of undiscovered\nmammals somewhere in the world\nis highly unlikely. Additionally,\nthere is a positive relationship\nbetween small body size and high\ndiversification rates, meaning that\ngroups of smaller organisms tend\nto have more species. This is why\nthere are so many more invertebrate\nspecies in comparison to mammals,\nbirds or even reptiles. At the same\ntime, the smaller the organism in\nquestion, the higher the chance it\nhas been overlooked, which is what\nmakes microbial diversity especially\ntricky to estimate.\n\u201cUntil recently, we\u2019ve lacked the\ntools to truly estimate the number\nof microbial species in the natural\nenvironment,\u201d Lennon points\nout. \u201cThe advent of new genetic\nsequencing technology provides an\nunprecedentedly large pool of new\ninformation.\nThe IU scientists used a\ncombination of microbial, plant and\nanimal community datasets from\na variety of sources and ecological\ntheory to create this new, rigorous\nestimate. In total a mega-sample\nof 5.6 million species from 35,000\nlocations across the globe was\ncompiled, from 35,238 distinct\nefforts sampling everything from\nbacteria, archea and fungi, to trees,\nbirds and mammals..\nThey suspected that aspects of\nbiodiversity would scale with the\nabundance of individual organisms,\nand indeed found a powerful trend\nof biodiversity changes across scale\nof abundance.\nThis estimate is coming at\nan interesting point of our\nunderstanding of microbial services.\nFor example recent studies have\nshown that the human virome (the\ncommunity of viruses that are part\nof our bodies microflora) may have\nbeneficial effects on our health. In\n2014 it was shown that a strain of\nMurine norovirus in mice, is more\nthan just a non-intrusive genetic\nhitch hiker,but actually helps restore\ndamage done to the intestine and\nimmune system. More importantly\nthe virus is genetically transmitted\nfrom parents to offspring, meaning\nthe benefits associated with carrying\nthe virus become genetic.\nAnother important service\nmicrobes offer is acting as potential\nsources of new meds. This becomes\nparticularly important if we think\nabout the progressing antibiotic\ncrisis. More and more infections\nare developing antibiotic resistance\nand becoming super-bugs. Last\nSeptember, a strain of Supergonorrhea started spreading\naround Leeds. Last year, scientists\nEstimating\nthe number\nof species\non Earth\nis among\nthe great\nchallenges\nin biology\nbroadens our understanding of\nEarth\u2019s biodiversity.\n\u201cEstimating the number of\nspecies on Earth is among the great\nchallenges in biology,\u201d Lennon, one\nof head scientists behind the new\nOf those\ncataloged\nspecies,\nonly about\n10,000\nhave ever\nbeen grown\nin a lab\ndeveloped a new antibiotic, the first\nin 30 years, by successfully culturing\na gram negative soil bacterium.\nMore importantly they developed a\nWith over 200 genera they still only represent a fraction of Earth\u2019s diversity.\nPhoto Credit: Picturepest\n\n"
