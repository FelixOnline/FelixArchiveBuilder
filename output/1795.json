Where along this road to\nwar did he decide to equate\nthe expansion of an alliance,\nwhich posed no military\nthreat to Russia unless\nprovoked, to military\ninvasion of a sovereign\nstate, or financial\nsanctions to nuclear war?\nMost of the Western\ncommentators have had a punt at\ndeciphering his reasoning. The\nAmerican thinktank The Atlantic\nCouncil said \u201cPutin has surrounded\nhimself with yes-men and reads\nselectively\u201d. Putin did actually get\nthe Russian parliament to rubber\nstamp his plans for invasion, though\nthis almost entirely not reported\non for how little it means. Defiance\nof Russian citizens against the\ninvasion is largely stifled from\nbeing heard by the rest of the world.\nThere have been whispers of self-blame from the political fringes of\nthe UK (and within Imperial College\nUnion, wouldn\u2019t you like to know).\nCorbyn and Dianne Abbott are among\nthe politicians blaming the West for\nhaving\u201cpouredoilonthefire\u201dandthat\n\u201cthe British government has talked up\nthe threat of war continually\u201d. While\nthe second quote is just simply untrue,\nthe sentiment very much echoes\nPutin\u2019s rhetoric, just in a less deranged\nway. Corbyn steers clear of calling\nZelenskyy a drugged-up Nazi, as Putin\ndid, but appears to fully support the\nidea that a military invasion is a fair\nresponse to the idea of Ukrainian\nmembership to Nato. Ignoring the\nfact that the real reason is most likely\nPutin\u2019s \u201cback in my day\u201d\nvision of a united USSR.\nYuval Noah Harari\nhighlighted how much\nof a one man ideal this\nconflict really is in a\npiece for The Guardian\non Monday. \u201cGorbachev\nleft Russians and Ukrainians\nfeeling like siblings; Putin has\nturned them into enemies\u201d. Putin\u2019s\npropaganda tells the story of a Russian\ninvasion to save Ukrainians from a\nfascist regime. The Economist said\non Sunday \u201cSoldiers, unsure of what\nthey are supposed to be doing, have\nturned up in Ukraine expecting to\nbe welcomed as liberators\u201d. Far from\nit, the Ukrainian resistance so far\n\u201cis the stuff nations are built from\u201d.\nThe only person who benefits\nfrom this crisis is Putin himself, in\nhis misguided attempt to cement his\nlegacy. UK Foreign Secretary Liz\nTruss said last week that the war may\nlast as long as a decade. No one knows\nhow many thousands may die in that\ntime as the result of one man\u2019s whim.\nFor the modicum that it\u2019s\nworth, Putin, in the words of the\nborder guards defending Zmiinyi\nIsland who have already lost\ntheir lives, \u201cgo fuck yourself \u201d.\nPutin\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "Red Pitch is an intricate tale of three sixteen-year-old boys reaching maturity in South London,\nwhere the only thing not changing in their lives is the\nfootball pitch they train so passionately on. This new\nplay at the Bush Theatre is a study on the depth of\nfriendship that binds our three characters together on\ntheir quest to become professional football players \u2014\nand, if the length of the standing ovation is anything to\ngo by, you\u2019d be remiss not to give it a go.\nThe acting of the trio Bilal (Kedar Williams-Stirling), Omz (Francis Lovehall) and Joey (Emeka Sesay)\nwas sublime. They masterfully execute moments of dialogue where they speak whilst looking straight at the\naudience but somehow look at no one. Their erratic\nand pride-riddled behaviour reminded me a lot of the\nway I saw the world at sixteen. The writing and cast\ncombined have the audience fawning over the boys\u2019\nloyalty to each other one minute and laughing out loud\nthe next.\nWilliams\u2019s writing is effortlessly funny. There are\nvery few actual jokes, but the boys\u2019 interactions around\nthe most mundane things\u2013such as sharing fried chicken\u2013have the audience laughing louder than the actors\ncan speak. Comedy plays a key role in the narrative of\nthis piece and only further exhibits the expertise of\nthose on stage. There are in-jokes between two of the\nthree boys in every combination, adding levels to their\nfoundational friendship and further layers to their\ncharacter. We get a sense that, whilst there is constant\ncompetition between the three, no one is really above\nanyone else.\nThe direction (Daniel Bailey) and stagecraft turn\nseemingly arbitrary body language into impactful fea-tures. The boys casually leaning against the railings of\nthe pitch leaves them uncomfortably close to the audience \u2014 cementing the illusion that the audience are invisible observers. As disagreement gave way to physical\nconfrontation on stage, I found my whole body tense\nup and my mouth fall open. It is hard to believe such\namazingly choreographed physicality works on such a\nsmall stage.\nMy one gripe with the play, advertised as \u2018a powerful story about gentrification, regeneration, and the\nimpact of this relentless change on London\u2019s communities\u2019, is that it\u2019s just simply not about gentrification\nat all. Or at least only in the way that Game of Thrones\nis about ironmongery. It\u2019s mentioned; there are several\nunnecessary allusions to the plight of \u2018Esme\u2019s drycleaners\u2019, but this does not advance the story. The boys are\ndrawn out of their home by the prospect of becoming\nprofessional footballers, not by increasing prices.\nAll that being said, if the play was billed just as a\ncoming of age story, I could scarcely fault it. The crew\nput together an act that no one could regret watching.\nFRIDAY 4TH MARCH 2022\n19\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nA familiar and intimate coming of age tale\nTheatre\nLAST CHANCE!\n...to apply for the Blyth Arts Fellowship \u2014 deadline Thurs 10th March!\nThe Blyth Arts Fellowship aims to develop a fine\nartpracticeatImperial.Thewinnerofthefellow-ship will receive four one-hour 1:1 mentoring sessions with a professional\nartist, a materials bursary\nof \u00a3500, and more.\nScan to find out more,\nand apply!\nFrancis Lovehall (Omz) in Red Pitch at the Bush Theatre\nCredits: Photo/ Craig Fuller\nKedar Williams-Stirling (Bilal), Francis Lovehall (Omz) and Emeka Sesay (Joey) in Red Pitch at the Bush Theatre\nCredits: Photo/ Craig Fuller\nReviewed by Sam Lovatt Editor in Chief\nRed Pitch\nWhere?

    "content": "ICCC take on BUCS track event\nOver the weekend three of our athletes drove seven hours to Glasgow\nin a snow blizzard to compete in the\nBUCS Track Cycling Championships\nfor ICCC. Yewande Adesida competed\nin women\u2019s sprint events of the flying\n200m and 500m time trials, just missing out on qualification by one place\nby 0.03 seconds! She was also the track\nmum for Jonah and I who are fairly new\nto track racing. Jonah Harris did the\nmen\u2019s kilo time trial,\nand would\u2019ve got a\nPB and qualified if\nhe had sprinted for\nthe second finish line\nrather than the first\n- an easy mistake to\nmake when you\u2019re\npushing so hard that\nyou\u2019re just looking at\nthegroundforawhite\nline. He then went on\nto the elimination\nrace, a bunch race of\n28 riders with one elimination each lap.\nA rider from Cambridge screwed him\nover by not leaving the track after being\neliminated meaning Jonah would have\nstill been in with a chance of sprinting\nfor the line but had thought he was eliminated whilst the rider was still going\naround the track (illegally). I raced the\nwomen\u2019s individual pursuit and points\nrace which was another bunch race of\nabout 16 riders. As an aero student I\nironically opted for the non-aerodynam-ic position for the 3000m IP and didn\u2019t\ncome last but wasn\u2019t fast. The points race\nconsisted of 60 laps with points going to\nthefirstfourridersoverevery10thlap,it\nwas my first bunch race and the pace was\nhigh (over 50kmph for the 60laps) so\nmy main aim was to stay upright. Travelling up in snowy blizzards and eating\npizza in Glasgow\u2019s city centre on a Saturday night were some of the highlights\nof the trip as well as some good track\nexperience of a steeper 250m track that\nis going to host the UCI World Championships next year.\nWe also got to race the\nlikes of Joe Trumen and\nSophie Capwell who\nare Team GB Sprinters - they obviously got\nloads of medals but\nthen again, they go to\nLoughborough...

A surprise ending that I don\u2019t\nthink anyone expected. The next morning, I woke up\nand found out who won through the Live Music Society\u2019s Instagram story.\nHeat 2: I performed but I swear I'll be\ncompletely impartial\nWe\u2019re back, it\u2019s Heat 2 of Live Music Society\u2019s\nBattle of the Bands. Straight away let me tell you I\nperformed tonight with Savtand, but I promise to be\nimpartial and also give you some insider information\nfrom the other side of the crowd (disappointingly,\nthere aren't any big secrets, sorry). Today, soundchecks\nbegan to run before the audience arrived but they\noverran and bands were setting their levels as people\nmilled into the bar. This left the crowd confused for\nthe second night in a row as bands graced the stage for\n5 minutes before leaving again.\nOnce this was over, the first band SXARD (pro-nounced Shard) began their performance. What\ncaught my eye was the huge pedal boards of the guitar-ists. They were used to create some interesting sounds\nand to add the drum and synth backing tracks which I\nassume had been programmed before the gig. The band\nhad a very mysterious quality that was enhanced by the\nethereal rock feel. Adding to this was the set being\nwhat I think was completely originals with one being\nabout \u201csleep paralysis\u201d, something I am terrified of ever\nexperiencing.\nThe transitions between bands were\nfaster tonight, so Warren\u2019s House began\ntheir performance a few minutes after SXARD left the stage. The night felt much\nsmoother and organised than Heat #1.\nThe band are formed of a bassist, a guitar-ist, a drummer and intriguingly, a flautist\nand saxophonist, and no vocals. I was in\nawe for the entire 20 minutes. Warren\u2019s\nHouse were the best musicians I saw all\nweekend. It was as if Black Midi or Black\nCountry, New Road became a funk out-fit. They were incredibly technically pro-ficient.

They predominantly played originals before ending on a slightly-calmer-than-the-origi-nal version of Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes\u2019 \u2018Kitty\nSucker\u2019. I apologise, I missed the middle songs of the\nset as I was tuning to be ready for my set with Savtand.\nWe (Savtand) played next. I hope people enjoyed\nour set, we played a mix of '00s pop punk from Avril\nLavigne to Paramore and also an original called \u2018Chardonnay\u2019 which can be found on Soundcloud. The set\nwas plagued by sound issues which I\u2019m sure the other\nbands faced too but could probably have been sorted\nby LMS renewing their equipment. The guitar turned\noff in sections due to faulty leads and the piano simply stopped working halfway through \u2018Primadonna\u2019\nby MARINA. Apart from these little things, I had fun\nperforming and I hope all the other acts in all the other\nheats did too.\nTonight, the final band were Winston And The Cat,\na rock group with a lead singer who seemed to have a\nCobain-esque hairstyle \u2013 fitting for the band\u2019s performance of \u2018In Bloom\u2019. The looks were mirrored by the\nsound: the lead singer also had a voice fit for Nirvana,\nable to belt the shout-singing sections with ease. This\nalso worked well for the band\u2019s final song, a cover of\n\u2018Everlong\u2019 by Foo Fighters.\nHeat #2 suffered some of the same flaws as Heat\n#1 with bands struggling to get people up dancing,\nand those who did only staying near the sides for their\nfriends\u2019 sets. I hope the seats are moved back so that\nthe crowd are encouraged to stand rather than sit. As\nan audience member, this makes the night much more\nenjoyable and energetic: as a band member, this makes\nit easier to be confident on stage as it is easier to see if\npeople are having a good time and dancing.\nLuckily, the LMS committee figured out their own\nvoting system tonight and the winning band was announced shortly after voting closed. Drum roll please.\nHeat 3: If you performed on Sunday\nat Reynold\u2019s Bar for the five-day Live\nMusic Society event, there\u2019s some really\ninteresting stuff on page 5 or something.\nNothing to see here.\nIt\u2019s Sunday night and we have four bands compet-ing: The Revelry, Electric Boom, Bakburner, and the\nMelon Band. I manage to make it to Reynold\u2019s Bar at\nexactly 7 PM, but there\u2019s already no place to sit and\nI\u2019m starting to appreciate the number of people Live\nMusic Society actually attracts. I wonder if anyone in\nthis tiny, nerdy college could model a relationship between the genre of music played, the number of members in a band, and the number of audience members\n(read: friends to increase votes). Food for thought.\nI can\u2019t get around the fact that I\u2019m walking the periphery of Charing Cross Hospital to get to this place.\nIt\u2019s a proper bar. Throwback-to-METRIC blue lights\ncool the wall behind a stage, adorned with placards\nreferencing University of Zambia among\nother places. The booths and loose chairs are\npacked to the brim so I\u2019ve occupied a pillar\nfor my note-taking activities. Bonus: it comes\nwith a little shelf I can use as a table so my\nhandwriting in, what has been dubbed, my\n\u201cscary notebook\u201d is going to look splendid\ntonight.\nI hear that Melon Band is an \u201canime\u201d\nband, which sort of explains the average audience member profile here. Not to mention\nthe fact that Melon Band consists of far more\nthan the normal complement of members\nin a band, featuring several violinists, key-boardists, vocalists, bassists, you name it. The\nwhole gang doesn\u2019t perform at every gig, but\nthe sheer size of it is definitely capable of giving them a more than significant number of\nvotes. New Gig Manager jokes that he should speak a\nfewwordsofMandarintoswaythevoteinfavourofhis\nband, especially since the intense politics of not getting\nsoundcheck has ensued.\nThe first band, The Revelry, takes its place on stage\nafter a welcome from our host of the night, Charlie\nWinner of Heat 2:\nWinston The Cat\nWarren's House (photo: Joe Riordan)\nSavtand (photo: Joe Riordan)\nWinner of Heat 1:\nHappenstance\nThe Revelry (photo: Yunke Zhou)\n\n"

Bats are a protected species and\nofficial guidance states that mouse traps\nmust never be used in areas where bats\nlive or are suspected to live. As far as the\nstudents we spoke to know, nothing is\ncurrently being done about the resident\nbats.\nThe problems seem to stem from a\nwider lack of campus service support.\nOther minor reports include lamp\ncovers full of dead wasps, a lack of basic\nappliances such as kettles and a supply\nof just three washing machines to serve\n96 residents. Stats on wahsing machines\nand Silwood residency numbers suggest\nthat the ratio of washing machines to\nstudents is actually above the sector\nstandard, though this does not adress\ninstances in which the machines break\ndown or the Circuit app does not work.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t even mentioned the\nbuilding itself yet\u201d said one of the\nstudents. \u201cMy bedroom has black and\ngreen mould on the walls.

A ten\nminute shower leaves an inch-deep\npuddle across the bathroom floor.

After waiting in the bustling queue to get a voting slip, I entered Reynolds expecting to see the first band up on stage, impressing the\ncrowd, however they hadn\u2019t even started soundchecks\nyet. For some reason, soundchecks took place right before each band\u2019s set rather than the allotted two hours\nbefore the crowds ar-rived. This made the\nnight slightly disjointed as each group sorted their tech in front\nof a waiting audience\nwhose confusion was\narticulated in what I\nhope was a well-in-tentioned \u201cwas that a\nsoundcheck?\u201d. Despite\nthe slight disorgani-sation, the packed bar\nwas behind every band\nand ready to hear some\ntunes.\nI\u2019ll admit some peoplemightsayI\u2019mbiased\ntonightbecausemyflatmateistheguitaristinDriftveil,\nbut that is balanced out by the fact that I\u2019ve heard the\nguitar parts of their set being incessantly practised on a\nloop for the last two weeks. The practice paid off as the\nband powered through the hits of rock legends from\nRage Against The Machine to Arctic Monkeys, even in\nthe daunting position of first band on the first night.\nHailing from the Midlands, the singer of Driftveil,\nmercifully, did not attempt to impersonate Alex Turner\u2019s northern accent during the fast-paced \u2018Brianstorm\u2019\n(to the joy of my Yorkshire-born self). A particular\nhighlight of this set was watching the drummer who\nplayed at an incredible speed and strength, even standing for some songs.\nSecond up to bat were Happenstance. Formed of the\nusual drums, guitars and whatnot, this band had the\nintriguing additions of a trumpet and a saxophone. Insider sources (I\u2019m friends with the singer) tell me that\nthe band had actually only practised twice for tonight,\nbut you can\u2019t tell at all. Happenstance had one of the\ntightest sets of the night, as long as you exclude the moment where the trumpet player\u2019s name was forgotten\nby the singer as she introduced the band. This funky set\nwas a refreshing change of pace from the usually indie\nperformances that dominate Battle of the Bands com-petitions, not that I dislike indie sets (we\u2019ll get to that\nlater, Parc Firm).\nUnfortunately, I missed Hydrodyne\u2019s set. However I was told that they were the first band of the night\nto play an original and they weren\u2019t the last. L.A.D.\n(pronounced Lad) played several songs they\u2019d written\nthemselves: one was about \u201clove, adventure, something\nlike that\u201d. Made up of only three musicians, L.A.D. had\na refreshing simplicity that was perfect for the chill indie pop-rock genre they were aiming for. Now is the\nperfect time to mention the pet hatred of all of the\nheats \u2013 the layout of Reynolds. Usually, LMS events\ntake place in Metric which (in non-Covid times) is\nalmost completely standing, especially at the stage.\nHowever, for the Battle of the Bands heats in Metric,\nthe performers have been left with a completely seated\ncrowd with the exception of a tiny bit of room in front\nof the stage and the side of the room. This makes it almost impossible for a band to invigorate the audience\nto get up and dance without friends placed as moles in\nthe crowd. L.A.D. were the first band of the night to\nget anyone to stand and bop at the front. It was only\nthe singer coming off stage and being joined by a lone\ndancer, I\u2019ll admit, but it was a start.\nWith cheers starting as early as their soundcheck\n(which was a set-worthy section of 'Johnny B. Goode'),\nParc Firm were up next. What followed was my favourite set of the night, headed by who I think was the best\nfrontman of the night, managing to get the audience\nmore involved than anyone else so far. This was helped\nby a crowd-pleasing setlist made up of indie hits like \u2018If\nYou Wanna\u2019 by The Vaccines and \u2018T-Shirt Weather\u2019 by\nCirca Waves. These tracks got everyone singing and a\ngroupjumpingalongatthefront.Carryingontheorig-inal song tradition set by the last two bands, Parc Firm\nshowcased one of their\nown. Twinkly guitars\nreminiscent of The\nSmiths had me fooled\nfor a second as I didn\u2019t\neven realise this was an\noriginal until the lead\nsinger announced at\nthe end that it was actually their own song\n\u2018Pretending\u2019whichwill\nbe \u201cout soon\u201d \u2013 maybe\nyou\u2019ll see it in Felix\nthen.Toendtheirturn\non stage, the band\npowered through a\ncover of \u2018Na\u00efve\u2019 by The\nKooks which was comparable to the band\u2019s own performance of it when I saw\nthem at O2 Brixton a few weeks ago.\nThefinalbandofthenightwereRatedR.Thesewere\nthe first band to get a crowd to consistently stay stood\nupatthefrontduringtheirwholeset(Ithinkmostwere\nfriends of the band, but it is still a good achievement\nconsidering the strange set-up of the venue). The subsequent set had the most energy of the night, propelled\nforward by the stood audience. Every single song in the\nsetwasaboldchoicebecausenoneofitwas2010sindie\n(again I swear I don\u2019t have anything against this, simply\na nice change), but every single song worked incredibly especially \u2018Beggin\u2019 which was recently propelled to\npopularity again by Maneskin. I am guessing this won\u2019t\nbe the first cover of this I hear in the next few days. The\njazzy, funky, rock mix of Rated R was obviously loved\nby the crowd as an encore was called for and received.\nNow all the bands had performed, I submitted my\nvoting slip into a jug on the bar and waited to see who\nwould take the first place in the final at Metric on\nMarch 10th. After waiting around 20 minutes for the\nBands of Imperial fight it out at Live Music\nSociety's Battle of the Bands\nRated R (photo: Joe Riordan)\nDriftveil (photo: Joe Riordan) Driftveil (photo: Joe Riordan)\n\n"

The new paper improves estimates\nby incorporating updated excess mortality rates up to October 2021.\nSpeaking to the College, Dr Juliette Unwin, lead author and Research\nFellow at Imperial\u2019s School of Public Health, said, \u201cSadly, as high as our\nestimates of orphanhood and caregiver deaths are, they are likely to be\nunderestimates, and we expect these numbers to grow as more global data\non COVID-19 deaths becomes available.\u201d Imperial\u2019s own COVID-19\nOrphanhood calculator, which includes more recent data, puts the\nnumber of children losing primary or secondary caregivers at 6.9 million.\nA white paper released by Imperial\u2019s Institute of Global Health\nInnovation(IGHI)hasfoundthatAIcouldworsenthehealthinequalities\nexperienced by minority ethnic groups, both in the UK and globally.\nThe issue of inequalities came to prominence in the UK during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, with minority ethnic groups facing a higher risk\nof dying amongst those diagnosed with the disease.

The wide-ranging report warns\nthat climate related impacts are worse than it previously estimated\nin its 2014 report, lends support to the concept of \u201closs and damage\u201d\nand suggests that the very worst impacts can still be avoided, provided\nurgent action is taken. The IPPCs Assessment Reports assess scientific,\ntechnical and socio-economic information around climate change, and\nare released approximately every six years. The first part of the Sixth\nAssessment Report was released in August 2021, and the fourth and final\npart, which concludes the report, is set to be released in October of this\nyear.\u201cThisreportrecognizestheinterdependenceofclimate,biodiversity\nand people and integrates natural, social and economic sciences more\nstrongly than earlier IPCC assessments,\u201d said Dr Hoesung Lee, Chair of\nthe IPCC. \u201cIt emphasizes the urgency of immediate and more ambitious\naction to address climate risks. Half measures are no longer an option.\u201d\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nFROM IMPERIAL\nThis week in Science Spotlight, we\nspeak to Zhengli Lim. You might\nbe more familiar with Mr Lim from\nhis DJing or his \u201cribbon dancing\u201d\non Queen's Lawn (he describes it as\n\u201can odd fusion which draws from the\nelements of Rhythmic Gymnastics,\nDance, DJ and Martial Arts\u201d), which\nhas earned him the nickname \u201cRibbon\nGuy\u201d. However, alongside all of this,\nZhengli is a third-year PhD student\nunder the supervision of Professor\nAimee Morgans, in the Department\nof Mechanical Engineering. He is\ninvestigating the feasibility of low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, to\nhelp combat climate change.\nFossil fuels contain carbon, which is released in large quantities as carbon dioxide\nupon combustion and is one of the major contributors to climate change. Engineers\naround the world are hard at work trying to find a way to reduce our carbon\nfootprint. One way to do so might be to mix conventional fossil fuels, which are\nused in transport and energy generation, with hydrogen gas.\n\u201cHydrogen does not contain carbon, so the more of it we can substitute into our\nfuels, the lower our resulting carbon footprint\u201d, says Zhengli. Using such a fuel mix\nprovides logistical and cost benefits too; unlike other low-carbon technologies, a\nhydrogen-fossil fuel mix would require only small changes to existing engines. This\nreduces costs and makes it easier to roll out changes on a large scale.\n\u201cMy research hopes to determine the feasibility of using these fuel mixtures and\nto what extent we can apply them to our current gas turbine technology. Hydrogen\nchanges many things about the fuel mixture, the most notable being the flame\nburning speed (see graph below). My simulations model the evolution of these\nhydrogen-enriched flames in a combustor. I've found that the higher burning speed\nof hydrogen generally results in shorter flames and a higher chance of flashback (the\ngas burns so fast that the flame burns into the injector). Another less obvious (but\njust as important) effect is the higher\npropensity for thermoacoustic\ninstability, which has to do with\nhow unsteady heat release from the\nflame causes the surrounding gases\nto vibrate at certain frequencies. If\nthese frequencies match the resonant\nfrequency of the combustor... let's\njust say things may start exploding\nin unintended places. My task is\nto predict these negative effects of\nburning hydrogen so that we can\nengineer solutions against them.\u201d\nScience Spotlight\nJamie John Science Editor\nwith Zhengli Lim, Aimee Morgans lab\nModelling low-carbon fuels\nFigure 1: Laminar flame speed (y-axis) increases with\nhydrogen enrichment (x-axis).\nPhoto credit: Zhengli Lim\nCredit: Zhengli Lim\n\n"

    "content": "Life and death are complicated experiences. They\nboth release a detritus of emotions that affect and\nshape not just the individual but everything around\nthem. Directed by Lucy Morrison and written by\nRuby Thomas, Animal Kingdom offers a careful and\ndelicate exploration family \u2014 after the suicide attempt of a university student Sam (played by a jittery\nyet engaging Ragevan Vasan) and the shaping of his\ndysfunctional childhood are teased in six therapy\nsessions.\nSam, a queer zoology graduate, has a stereotypically dysfunctional family history! A cheating father,\nparents who divorced in his teens, and a half-sister\nfrom his father\u2019s affair that Sam struggles to associate\nwith. But, more importantly, a family that is\u2013at the\nsame time\u2013both there for him, and not. Together with\nhis therapist Daniel (played by a calm and measured\nPaul Keating) and the rest of the familial cast, the play\ndelves deep into each of their relationships with Sam.\nFor the most part, the family depict stereotypical\ncharacters that can be found in any tale of family and\nmental health \u2014 the cold, distant, infidelious father\nTim (Jonathan McGuinness); the suffocating mother\nRita (Marina Laird) who refuses to listen to her chil-dren; and a sibling (a wonderfully peppy Ashna Rabheru) who is caught up in the turmoil, forced to act\nbeyond their age. Not unsurprisingly the play is tame\non paper; what makes it stand out is the sharp honesty\nin the dialogues taking the narrative into heavier places\nthat feel unnervingly real.\nThe minimal set design in Hampstead Theatre\u2019s\n\u2018Downstairs\u2019 stage deserves major credit for allowing\nthe script and the actors to shine. Featuring only a\nsmallroomwithfivechairs,animaginarytwo-waymir-ror, and a single wall for Sam to vent his frustrations on\nfrom time to time, the play makes best of the small and\ncrampedspacestoprovideanenhancedlevelofintima-cy to the narrative and to the audience.\nWe are there next to Sam when he pummels the\nsingular wall after his mother refuses to listen to him;\nwe are a fly-on-the-wall as his sister owns up to being a\nteenager, finally venting her pent-up frustrations. In all\nthese instances, we are uncomfortably close\u2026 the voices bounce off us before they hit the actors and, in that\nsense, they make us an equal part of this family.\nThe entire cast provide memorable performances,\nbut Ragevan Vasan as Sam stands out with his wonderful and sensitive portrayal of someone coming to\nterms with the consequences of his actions, on himself\nand those around him. He is jittery throughout the\nplay (whether it is during his monologues or when he\nis daydreaming about birds\u2026) constantly on edge like\na drug addict, but with a touch of empathy and depth\nin his eyes, that makes us feel sorry for him rather than\njudgemental. Laird, as Rita, is annoyingly accurate in\npainting her picture of someone who has too much to\nsay and too little patience to listen.\nIt is telling that Sam\u2019s favourite birds are Swifts \u2014\nknown for two things. They are one of the fastest birds\naround, fleeting from branch to branch, and also have\nthe weakest legs. Much like them, Sam is unrooted;\ndrifting from person to person for much of his child-hood, meandering between a talkative yet inattentive\nmother, an absent and stoic father, and an adolescent\nsister and half-sister struggling to find her place in this\ndysfunctional family.\nSo, give this play a try. Put yourself in uncomfortably\nclose quarters and experience the trauma that indiffer-ence, especially from family members, can labour on a\nperson. Sam will be unsure what he is going to do at the\nend of the play, but certainly just like every other member of the audience, you will walk away knowing full\nwell the virtues of listening to those around you with a\nlittle compassion.\nA jittery drama that is often too close for comfort!\nTheatre\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n18\nEdited by:\nAlexander Cohen\nAlex Jackson\nBoxuan Zhang\nArts The Bush scores!\nNew coming of age tale,\nRed Pitch, delights\nReviewed by Sam Lovatt\npage 19\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Writer\nAnimal Kingdom\nWhere?

    "content": "On 9th February 2022, researchers\nat the Joint European Torus (JET)\nannounced that they had generated the\nhighest sustained energy pulse through\nnuclear fusion. JET is a research facility\nlocated at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy near Oxfordshire, England.\nThe reactor generated 59 megajoules\nof heat over five seconds. Prior to this\nexperiment, the record for the highest\nsustained energy pulse was also held by\nJET since 1997. The new record is more\nthan double the previous record of 21.7\nmegajoules of heat energy produced in\nfour seconds.\nFusion reactions have been gaining\ninterest in the scientific community to\ncircumvent the challenges of disposing\nradioactive waste from fission reactions.\nFusion products are assessed to be less of\na health hazard because they become benign over a shorter timescale compared\nto fission products. For example, tritium\nremaininginthereactorwillberendered\nharmless in a matter of decades as it has a\ncomparatively short half-life of 12 years.\nHowever, radioactive waste from fission\nreactors such as strontium-90 and caesi-um-137 both have longer half-lives of 30\nyears. These by-products of fission reactions emit penetrating radiation and are\nclassified as high-level waste which must\nbe buried in deep geological reposito-ries.\nAt JET, equal proportions of deuterium and tritium were used as fuel for the\nreaction. This ratio was decided upon\nby the researchers as it allows for the\nreaction to occur at the lowest possible\ntemperature while obtaining the highest\nenergy output. Tritium and deuterium\nare both hydrogen atoms as they have\none proton in the nucleus. The most\ncommon form of hydrogen, protium,\ndoes not have neutrons in the nucleus.\nHowever, deuterium and tritium have\none and two neutrons in the nucleus respectively and are known as isotopes of\nhydrogen.\nTo initiate a fusion reaction, deuterium and tritium are heated up. Negatively charged electrons begin to break away\nfrom the hydrogen atoms, which then\nbecome positively charged hydrogen\nions. The hot mixture of electrons and\nionsisknownasaplasma.Fusionofdeu-terium and tritium nuclei begins at 100\nmillion degrees Celsius. The products of\nthis reaction are helium, neutrons and\nheat energy.\nA tokamak reactor was used at JET to\nprovideacontrolledenvironmentforthe\nreactions to take place. For nuclear fusion to occur, the plasma must be dense.\nThe high density of the plasma increases\nthe likelihood of collisions between the\nions, which would otherwise experience\nrepulsion because they are charged. The\nplasma also must not come into contact\nwith the walls of the tokamak, other-wise, the walls will melt. Therefore, the\ntokamak reactor employs a powerful\nm a g n e t i c\nfield that\nisolates the\nplasma in\nthe shape\nof a dough-nut. While\nthis shape\nprevents the\nplasma from\nt o u c h i n g\nthe walls,\nheat energy\nproduced by\nthe fusion\nre a c ti ons\ncan still be\nabsorbed in the walls of the tokamak.\nIf future reactors are integrated into\nthe power grid, the heat energy can be\nused to heat up water, producing steam,\nand then turn a turbine which generates\nelectricity.\nThe efficiency of a nuclear-fusion\nreactor is assigned with the value, Q,\nwhich indicates the ratio of the power output of the nuclear reactor to the\npower input. When the Q value of a reactor is equal to 1, the reactor would be\ndeemed to have achieved a break-even.\nThe pulse generated at JET was ascribed\nwith a Q value of 0.33. While the experiment was regarded as a success, further\nimprovements need to be made so that\nthe power input can be justified by the\npower output.\nThe experiment conducted at JET\nacts as a preliminary study for future experiments at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)\nlocated at Saint-Paul-l\u00e8s-Durance in\nFrance. Both JET and ITER are research\nreactors that are regularly compared to\neach other to optimise the conditions\nfor nuclear fusion. Between 2009 and\n2011, JET was shut down as engineers\nworked on reconstructing the walls\nof the reactor to model the design of\nITER. The successful trial at JET acts\nas a springboard for future design decisions for ITER, which is slated to start\nconducting fusion experiments in 2025.\nHowever, as ITER operates on a much\nlarger scale than JET, an experiment\nconducted with the same parameters at\nITER is predicted to achieve a Q value\nof 10. If accomplished, this result will be\na breakthrough for the nuclear industry\nas it will be the first reaction in which\nmore power is generated as an output\ncompared to the initial power input.\nWhile the trial at JET was a triumph,\nresearchers are still grappling with challenges in scaling up nuclear fusion tech-nology. For example, a solution needs to\nbe devised to dissipate the surplus heat\nin the exhaust regions of tokamak re-actors. Though this was not a problem\nduring the experiment at JET, a bigger\nreactor like ITER will require a slightly modified design to cope with a large\nexcess of heat produced due to the enormous amount of power that is predicted\nto be generated.\nAmidst the recent breakthrough, Dr\nAthina Kappatou from the Max Planck\nInstitute of Plasma Physics acknowledges that \u201cFusion takes a long time, it\nis complex, it is difficult. This is why we\nhave to ensure that from one generation\nto the next, there are the scientists, there\nare the engineers and the technical staff\nwho can take things forward.\u201d Certainly,\nthe results at JET will encourage scientists to persevere as they contribute to\nthe record-breaking developments that\nare to come.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n14\nFusion and the Future: Record-Breaking\nPulse Generated by Nuclear-Fusion Reactor\nRachel Rajan George Science Writer\nThe Joint European Torus, a fusion reator in the UK\nPhoto credit: UKAEA\nInside of JET reactor with overlaid view of plasma during operiation\nPhoto credit: UKAEA\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n28\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nfrom Imperial-born band Goldstag. I immediately\nrecognise them as the band that sang a chilling rendition of 'Newborn Again' by Muse during a big LMS gig\nmonths ago. The lead singer of the\nband is hard to forget \u2013 he erupts\ninto highly-vibratoed singing in\nsome unknown octave, and immediately simmers to a stoic head nod\nas if he didn't just do that. This time\nround, he has a pair of sunglasses\nand a megaphone. The set list includes an upcoming LMS Mandopop standard, 'Fearless' by Jay\nChou, much to the amusement of\nour friendly neighbourhood Mandopop tribute artist, sitting in the\nback with his arms crossed. Complete with a victorious jump at the\nend of the set, the only thing that\ndisadvantaged their performance\nwas the unfortunate sound mixing.\nHeavy emphasis on backing vocals\nundermined the \u201cbacking\u201d part. I\nsuppose to some degree, the excitement of having their\nvoices resonating through the whole bar encouraged\nthe guitarists/vocalists to abandon their harmonies\nand opt for something closer to speak-singing.\nNext up is Electric Boom, who edges towards arena rock with renditions of 'Don't Stop Me Now' and\n'Livin' On A Prayer'. Because I'm a huge cynic, I think\nof these as easy songs, guaranteed to elicit a reaction.\nPeoplewhojustturneduptosupportafriendwillmost\ndefinitelyturntheirheads,shareamomentofsurprised\nrecognition, and sing along with the band. However,\nLMS frequenters such as myself cross their arms and\nlet out a sigh. There\u2019s one exception to this, of course:\n'Tiny Dancer'. My \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d fantasies of singing on a road trip replace my journalistic tendencies\nand I join in the ode to \u201cblue jean baby\u201d. All in all, it\nwas actually the other Elton John hit that renewed my\nfaith in Electric Boom. Although the vocalist would be\nadvised to channel his energy into controlling his voice\nlike one would an instrument, the actual instruments\nin 'Saturday Night\u2019s Alright' were beautifully in sync\nand remarkably like the original.\nBakburner, the third band (lead vocalist being front-of-crowd favourite, New Gig Manager), evokes heavy\napplause before even making it onto stage. They burst\ninto the iconic staccatoed drum intro of 'Out of the\nBlack' by Royal Blood, sliding into the blues-y thundering guitar that makes up the body of the song. As\nalways, I\u2019m fated to stand behind the head-bangers so\nI get a transient view of the band every few seconds. I\nbriefly consider the pros and cons of whacking my relatively longer hair on them. New Gig Manager\u2019s infectious energy translates into loose, textured vocals reminiscent of Julian Casablancas more than Royal Blood\u2019s\nMike Kerr. Sure enough, the band plays the Strokes\u2019\n'Reptilia', before which they execute a clean segue into\nJet\u2019s 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl'. New Gig Manager\nprefaces this performance with a cheeky \u201cI have one\nquestion\u201d. Woah, slow down there; it seems we\u2019re coming dangerously close to what my friend calls \u201cdickhead\ncharisma\u201d. Keep it in your pants. On the other hand,\nhe may have earned it - given how well he\u2019s adapted the\nCasablancas drawl. The set\ncloses with the Monkeys\u2019\n'Brianstorm' and 'I Bet You\nLook Good on the Dance\nFloor' \u2013 the star of these performances is the most enthusiastic guitarist I\u2019ve ever seen\nin my life. I wouldn\u2019t be the\nleast surprised if he compulsively erupts into the Carlton\nDance.\nThe last performance is\ngivenbyMelonBand\u2013atribute to the anime hits I have\nvery little knowledge of. But\nwhen the regular cohort of\ndrummer, guitarist and bassist is accompanied on stage by\na trumpeter and saxophonist, I hold my breath. What\nensued is a punchy, yet dynamic, combination of funky\nbig band-inspired music that shifts its focus from instrument to instrument, giving everyone a moment to\nshine. Their next song features a singer who is the epitomeoftheword\u201ckawaii\u201d\u2013skirt,stockings,spacebuns,\nthe whole package. An impressive Japanese anime rock\nsong is followed by lead singer of Tremolo taking a\nbreak from his crowd-pleasing arena rock performanc-es. I might be slightly critical of Tremolo, but their lead\nvocalistdefinitelyhasaknackforperformingthisgenre\nof fast-paced, power chord-driven Japanese rock.\nI\u2019ve come to realise that I enjoy bands who can avoid\nexplosive instrumentals that submerge vocals and the\nvarious musical Easter eggs that the band themselves\nplant in their music \u2013 obviously barring bands who\nhave no such sound nuggets and are just plain boring.\nBut everyone has their unique sound and I notice a lot\nof it getting buried under poor equalising and, frankly,\njust the excitement of doing a live performance. There\u2019s\na special place in my heart (or auditory cortex?) for\nbands that can find that golden balance between quality and volume. It\u2019s that magical ratio that can give a listener chills while thrashing their head back and forth.\nHeat 4: Somehow there\u2019s less room to\ndance.\nI walked into Reynolds on Monday night and was\nhorrified, it makes me ill, the layout of the bar has got\neven worse. Chairs are arranged in rows like a primary\nschool concert, even further alienating the audience.\nI\u2019ll give it the benefit of the doubt and see how the\nnight goes.\nFirstly, I need to admit I have Horizons on a Monday 4-6 which is compulsory for my course, so I\u2019d like\nto profusely apologise to Tremolo, but I missed their\nset. I would have loved to see them because they were\none of my favourite acts at Tribute Night back in December. I heard from other people there that they had a\ngreat set and I just wish I had made my tea faster.\nI arrived just as Hue & Moment got on\nstage, already having sound checked\nearlier in the evening (issues with\nthislikeonpreviousnightsseemto\nhave been avoided tonight). The\nband kicked my night off with\na fast-paced rendition of McFly\u2019s \u20185 Colours In Her Hair\u2019,\nafter this the lead singer\nadmitted \u201cwe have never practised as a whole\nband\u201d. You can tell from\nlittle timing blips and\nmissed hits but overall, the\nset is impressive for what is\nthe pop rock band\u2019s first collective performance. Hue &\nMoment press on through an\nenergetic \u2018Misery Business\u2019 and\n\u2018Stacy\u2019s Mom\u2019 which showcases\nthe guitarist who takes the original solo by Fountains of Wayne\nand makes it a thousand times more\ninteresting before ending with Bowling\nFor Soup\u2019s \u2018High School Never Ends\u2019.\nTina & The Sexy Cats take to the stage\nnext and bring a huge crowd up to the front\nwith them. In any other venue, with any other layout this would have made for an electrifying atmosphere however everyone had to\nstand off to one side. Despite this, the lead\nsinger (who I assume is Tina) has enough\nconfidence and showmanship to get the\naudience singing along to The Sexy Cats\u2019\nrocky covers of pop hits like \u2018Beggin\u2019 and\n\u2018Toxic\u2019. A special mention goes out to the\ndrummerwhogotsointothesongsthat\nI think one of his sticks snapped and\nanother flew out of his hand: luckily,\nhehadspares.EndingonABBAalways\nwins me over so the \u2018Gimme!

Their whole\nset had the feel of a very good karaoke performance, in the best way\npossible.

    "content": "Extreme wildfires to become 30% more common\nby 2050, predicts landmark UN report\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nAnew report released last week\nby the United Nations Environment Programme in conjunction with\nGRID-Arendal, has predicted that extreme wildfires will become 30% more\ncommon by the end of 2050. The 126-page report, assembled by a team of\nover 50 leading experts from around the\nworld, is a comprehensive description of\nthescaleandextentoftheglobalwildfire\ncrisis.Changesinland-use,alongsidecli-mate change, are leading to an increase\nin the number of extreme wildfires,\nwhich have severe consequences for humans and the environment. \u201cWhile the\nsituation is certainly extreme, it is not\nyet hopeless,\u201d says the foreword to the\nreport.\nWhat are wildfires?\nWildfires (equivalently called\n\u201cbushfires\u201d, \u201cwildland fires\u201d and \u201cforest\nfires\u201d), are fires occurring in vegetation\nsuch as forests, grass or peatland\n(partially decayed organic matter).\nAre all wildfires bad?\nNo, wildfires are an important part\nof the natural world, playing a critical\nrole in ecological and environmental\nprocesses.Theyoccuroneverycontinent\nexcept for Antarctica, and enable the\ncycling of important elements, such as\noxygen and carbon, which are essential\nfor life on Earth. In fact, many plants\nand animals are adapted to wildfires\nto kill off competitors. Wildfires also\nplay an important role in replenishing\nnutrients in the soil.\nHistorically, the role of wildfires in\nnutrientcyclinghasbeenunderestimated.\nIn the USA, for example, the federal\ngovernment campaigned aggressively\nfor wildfire suppression, leading to a\nbuild-up of dead, dry wood, which,\nironically has played a role in increasing\nthe number of extreme wildfires there.\nIt is only since the 1990s that US\ngovernmental agencies have recognised\nthe importance of managing wildfires,\nwhich sometimes means burning small\nportions of vegetation to prevent larger\nfires in the future. This practice is called\n\u201cprescribed burning\u201d and was practiced\nby Native Americans for hundreds of\nyears, before it was outlawed in the US\nfor much of the 20th century, as part of\nthe suppression policy.\nThe UN report makes a distinction\nbetween \u201cgood\u201d wildfires, and \u201cbad\u201d\nwildfires. \u201cGood\u201d wildfires support\necosystemsandareintegraltoourplanet.\nThey are typically lower intensity, and\neasy to control using regular firefighting\nresources. \u201cBad\u201d wildfires, on the other\nhand, have a detrimental impact on\nhuman livelihoods, the economy, or the\nenvironment. It has been known for a\nnumber of years now that the number\nof \u201cbad\u201d wildfires has been increasing.\nA combination of factors has led to this.\nWhat impact are the\nextreme wildfires having?\nThe increasing number of extreme\nwildfires is affecting human health,\ncritical infrastructure, economies and\nthe environment. The report says that\nexposure to wildfire smoke, specifically\nparticulate matter, is the greatest health\nconcern. In the western United States,\nwildfires have been responsible for\n50% of particulate matter (PM2.5) air\npollution, which marks a significant\nincrease over the past decade.\nWildfires can degrade water supplies,\ndisrupt power supplies and damage\nroads, railways and communication\ncables. This, in combination with\nforced business closures and disrupted\nsupply chains, can lead to job losses and\neconomic damage. A study estimated\nthat economic losses from Indonesia\u2019s\n2015 wildfires amounted to US$16.1\nbillion, equivalent to 1.9% of the\ncountry\u2019s GDP.\nExtreme \u201cmegafires\u201d are wiping out\nnatural habitats and pushing some plant\nand animal species closer to extinction.\nAustralia\u2019s 2019-2020 megafires,\nexacerbated by drought and land-use\nchanges, are estimated to have wiped\nout billions of domesticated and wild\nanimals. In the Amazon region, logging\nand climate change have resulted in\n\u201cdaunting estimates of biodiversity loss\nafter fire\u201d.\nIn South-East Asia and the Arctic,\nwildfires lasting several months are\nresulting in the destruction of peatland,\nreleasing large quantities of carbon (5%\nof total human CO2\nemissions) into\nthe atmosphere. Peatlands accounts for\nonly 3% of the Earth\u2019s land surface but\nare responsible for the storage of 30%\nof all soil carbon. Peat takes millions of\nyears to re-form, meaning the damage is\neffectively permanent.\nFurthermore, climate change and\nwildfires are described as \u201cmutually\nexacerbating\u201d; climate change increases\nthe intensity and length of fire seasons,\nand then wildfires destroy carbon-rich\necosystems, exacerbating climate change\nin a feedback loop.\nHow can we respond to this\ncrisis?\nThe report is not all doom and\ngloom. It concludes by recommending\na number of actions to prevent and\nprepare for wildfires, offering hope. The\nactions are tailored to different regions\nacross the world and the report notes\nthe global disparity in effects. Wildfires\ndisproportionately affect the world\u2019s\npoorest nations, but global research\nand funding is concentrated in richer\nnations.\n\u201cCurrent government responses to\nwildfires are often putting money in\nthe wrong place,\u201d says Inger Andersen,\nUNEP Executive Director. \u201cWe have to\nminimize the risk of extreme wildfires\nby being better prepared: invest more\nin fire risk reduction, work with local\ncommunities, and strengthen global\ncommitment to fight climate change\u201d.\nJamie John Science Editor\nFRIDAY 4TH MARCH 2022\n25\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nMonika Yardonova\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment\nView online here!\n\u2022 Climate change \u2013 higher air temper-atures, more drought and strong winds\nin certain parts of the world have been\nlinked to an increase in the number of\nso-called \u201cmegafires\u201d - large, intense,\nlong-lasting and uncontrollable - these\nfires are most certainly bad.\n\u2022 Changes in land use \u2013 humans are\nreshaping the landscape in different ways, which, at a local level, is\nchanging the dominant vegetation,\nand patterns of fires. Take Indonesia,\nwhere tropical peatlands, which have\nhistorically been flooded with water,\nhave been drained in order to provide\nfood for the country\u2019s growing popula-tion. This has led to an increase in the\nnumber of peat wildfires.\n\u2022 Population movement \u2013 movements\nin population are affecting wildfire be-haviour, and placing more people near\nwildfire hotspots, which puts them at\ngreater risk of suffering damages.\nFactors increasing the\nnumber of \u201cbad\u201d wildfires:\nA forest burning in Siberia\nCredit: Julia Petrenko/Greenpeace\n\n"

This follows the December\n1st-3rd strike on the same issue.\nOn 22nd February, the USS\u2019s Joint\nNegotiating Committee (JNC) voted\nin favour of formally ratifying the\nimplementation of reforms to the USS\npension scheme. The JNC had held\ndiscussions with representatives from\nUniversities UK (UUK) - representing\nvice chancellors and principals\n- and the UCU, on the changes:\n\u2022 Employers contribute 21.6% of\nannual pay, (increase of 0.2%)\n\u2022 USS members (employees)\ncontribute 9.8% of their\nannual pay, (increase of 0.3%)\n\u2022 Yearly accrual rate is\nreduced from 1/75 to 1/85\n\u2022 Defined benefits will now\nbe accrued on salaries above\n\u00a340k (rather than \u00a360k)\n\u2022 Benefits protected from inflation\nare reduced from full protection\nup to 5% and half protection\nbetween 5% and 15% to 2.5%\nAccording to the Office for\nNational Statistics the rate of\ninflation in January 2022 was 4.9%.\nThese changes were first proposed by\nthe USS after a valuation of its assets on\n31st March 2018, which put promised\npension benefits at \u201c\u00a367.3bn and the\ncurrent value of assets at \u00a363.7bn.\u201d This\nresulted in a \u00a33.6bn deficit, meaning\nthat the \u201cScheme was 95% funded\u201d.\nAccording to the USS, \u201cEconomic\nconditions during the 2018 valuation\nwere challenging and volatile\u201d, and\nso justified a need for a \u201csnapshot\u201d\nvaluation on 31st March 2020.\nWhenthissnapshotwastaken,theUSS\nScheme\u2019sassets\u201cstoodat\u00a366.5bnbutthe\ndeficit \u2026 [was] \u00a312.9bn\u201d (84% funded).\nRecognising that March was the month\nthat Covid-19 first hit UK\u2019s shores, a\nfollow-up \u2018snapshot\u2019 was scheduled for\n31st December 2020, at which point\n\u201cassets stood at \u00a380.5bn but the deficit\n.. [was] \u00a327.9bn\u201d (74% funded) as the\npandemic entered its first UK winter.\nAccording to the USS, \u201cWhilst there\nhas been a recent recovery in some asset\nvaluestopre-pandemiclevels,theoutlook\nfor expected future investment returns\nhas, if anything, deteriorated since\nthe valuation date of 31 March 2020\u201d.\nAdditionally, the USS predicted\n(falsely)thatthestudentintakefollowing\nthe pandemic, including international\nstudents, would be lower than expected.\nThis was not the case, as \u201cdomestic\nstudent numbers at the sector level\nappeartobehigherthanexpectedbefore\nthe summer\u201d. On 31st September 2021,\nthe Scheme\u2019s promised pension benefits\nwere valued at \u00a380.6bn, and the assets\nwere valued at \u00a366.5bn. This indicated\na deficit of \u00a314.1bn, which meant\nthat the Scheme was 82.5% funded.\nTocontinuetodecreasethedeficit,the\nUSS reported on 16th February 2022\nthat \u201cemployers contributions would\ncontinue to rise over time to 38.2% of\npay, and member contributions would\nsteadilyincreaseto18.8%ofsalary-57%\nin total, with new benefits requiring\ncontributions of 37% of pay and 20%\ngoing towards repairing the deficit\u201d.\nOn 31st January 2022, another\n\u2018snapshot\u2019 shows promised pension\nbenefits at \u00a392.2bn, and asset\nvalue of \u00a389.3bn. (97% funded).\nThe UCU had submitted a\n\u201ccompromise proposal \u2026 to protect\nbenefits whilst a new evidence-based\nvaluation of the scheme was completed\u201d,\nwhich was confirmed by a USS\ntrustee on 10th February 2022 to be\nimplementable and viable. This means\n\u201can additional \u00a3200m annually from\nApril [2022], then an extra \u00a3330m\nannually from October [2023], and\n\u2013 ultimately \u2013 \u00a3700m more per annum\nuntil April 2024\u201d and a combined\ncovenant support from 340 universities,\nbasedonthe31stMarch2022valuation.\nHowever,UUKrejectedtheproposal,\nciting that by asking for additional\nannual contributions, \u201cthe union is\nasking employers to put pensions before\nother university priorities including\nthe student experience, pay, and the\njobs of its members\u201d, and that \u201cPaying\nmore would have a significant and\ndetrimental impact on the sector\u2019s\ncollective ability to deliver high-quality\neducation and research\u201d. According to\nHigher Education Provider Finance\nData, in the 2019/20 year, universities\nbrought in a total income of \u00a341.9bn,\nand had reserves totalling \u00a346.8bn.\nAt the picket line on the 21st of\nFebruary 2022, a striking lecturer\nfrom the Mathematics Department at\nImperial claimed that during discussions\nwith striking staff in 2018, the now-deceased Provost Professor James\nStirling \u201csaid quite explicitly that decent\npensions to university staff were a form\nof deferred salary. Does the college still\nstand by those words? If they do, they\nadmit to cutting salaries. They can either\ngo for a reasonable settlement with the\nUSS dispute, or change the deferred\nsalary to a current salary. According to\nmy calculations, that means a 15 to 20%\npayrise.\u201dOtherstaffattendingthepicket\nlineoverZoomclaimedthatanyattempt\nat discussion with Imperial College\nLondon became \u201ctalk[s] only about\nprocedure\u201dandthat\u201ctheyarenottalking\nto us on a level with facts and figures\u201d.\nCurrently, the Imperial UCU\nmandate of action short of a strike\n(ASOS) lasts until 3rd May 2022. On\nhearing of the rejection of the UCU\nproposal, UCU branch organiser\nRoddy Slorach proposed further strike\ndays: 7th-10th March and 14th-18th\nMarch, which must be approved by\nthe Higher Education Committee,\nwho last met on 25th February 2022.\nAdditionally, the UCU has\nindicated that more industrial\naction is to be expected, including\na marking and assessment\nboycott later this academic year.\nAmeena Hassan Deputy Editor\n\n"

    "content": "ing none of it \u2013 straight faced throughout\nwas the perfect juxtaposition (think Ben\nMack from Sports team). A repeat of \u2018Toxic\u2019 was made slightly underwhelming just\nby unlucky band orderings with Tina &\nThe Sexy Cats already performing it. I like\nthe song so it\u2019s okay though, I\u2019m always up\nfor more Britney. The set ended with The\nJackson 5\u2019s \u2018I Want You Back\u2019, showcasing\nthe bassist as he played some funky riffs.\nThe final performance, by\nTroan, was the closest I\nthink an LMS event\nwill ever get to\na chore- o -graphed light\nshow. Once\nthe band\nare on stage,\nthey ask for\nthe lights to be\ndimmed, revealing the glow sticks they\nhave covered themselves in. Throughout\nthe set it seems like either the band spoke\nto the lighting guy prior, or he had been\nsleeping and finally woke up because the\nlights actually change more than once.\nTroan cover a range of songs from rock\nhits to pop fan-favourites, the highlights being \u2018Get Lucky\u2019 and \u2018Mr Brightside\u2019 \u2013 which they ended on. The band\nmanage to get a few people up danc-ing, a number I think would have increased if it wasn\u2019t for the horrific layout of the bar.\nHeat 5: We finally got a table and promptly abandoned to\nstand right in front of the speak-ers. Make of that what you will.\nYunke and I survey the scene around us and\nnotice the group ahead colouring in cardboard\nsigns to support their favourite band. We\u2019re not\nsure which band it\u2019s directed at but the signs\nread \u201cKelvin makes me wet\u201d and \u201cZaddy\nZhou\u201d. After a WHOLE HOUR of banal\nsoundcheck (I repeat, an hour I could\nhave used to NOT run from the\nbus stop afraid I\u2019ll miss the first\nperformance\u2013thethingsIdofor\nthisnewspaper),thefirstband,AldoSter-one, mounts the stage. An 80s post-punk\naficionado near me swears he knows the\nintroductory synth sequence and squints\ntrying to identify it. The song swells and a\ndeep husky voice sings \u201cAnd I know she\u2019ll\nbe the death of me/At least we\u2019ll both be\nnumb\u201d. The post-punk fan sinks with a\n\u201cnevermind\u201d.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t how the rest of the\naudience receives the song. It slips\ninto a guitar-enriched pop song in a\nfunk outfit. I immediately recognise\nTom Norton from a comedically raunchy cover of \u2018Shake Your Money Maker\u2019\nfrom Open Mic Night. Interestingly, he\nchannels his bluesy guitar moves to back-dropthenot-so-bluessongsthattheband\nplays: \u2018The Less I Know the Better\u2019, \u2018Back\nto Black\u2019, \u2018Feel it Still\u2019 and \u2018Seven Nation\nArmy\u2019. Most notably, a swift transition to\n\u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 is welcomed with an\ninstrumental overload the band was finding hard to avoid in the previous songs.\nLuckily, they save one song for that barrage of heavy drums, rumbly guitar and\nsurprisingly techno keyboard solo. We\nwatched the drummer finally let loose,\nvaguely reminding me of Animal from\nthe Muppets.\nThe Immigrants follow closely behind\nwith \u2018Whole Lotta Love\u2019\u2019s immediately\nidentifiable pulsing guitar riff and Diego Mesa\u2019s piercing vocals. We gape at\nhow similar they are to Robert Plant\u2019s.\nIn fact, all their Led Zeppelin renditions\n\u2013 \u2018Ramble On\u2019, \u2018Good Times, Bad Times\u2019,\nand \u2018Rock and Roll\u2019 \u2013 are faithfully repli-cated, all the way from the guitar tone in\ntheir solos to their meandering outros and\nPlant\u2019s passionate screeches in the middle\nof songs. The attention to detail is truly mesmerising.\nAlthough one criticism could be that they performed\nmore like a Led Zeppelin tribute band than a band in\ntheir own right, \u2018Rock and Roll\u2019 featured more of Mesa\u2019s\nown vocal customisations.\nThird came the Sellouts, opening with the second\nAmy Winehouse tribute of the night, and also the second \u2018Valerie\u2019 of the whole five-day lineup. Izzy has a\ndeep, rounded voice that, while very pleasing, doesn\u2019t\nmatch the soulful texture that would normally complement the original arrangement of the song. On the\nother hand, it went incredibly well with \u2018This Love\u2019 by\nMaroon 5. The band\u2019s two guitarists play against the\ngrowing rumble of the bass in the Sellouts\u2019 cover of\nMuse\u2019s cover of \u2018Feelin\u2019 Good\u2019. The guitar-led build-up\nmight be what makes this the strongest song by the\nband.\nMonkeys in Living Form Society (the abbreviation\nnearly slipped by me) play \u2018Maria\u2019 by Blondie, sung\nby a vocalist channelling Pulp Fiction\u2019s Mia Wallace.\nThe band's best performances are their\nversions of some classic alternative hits\nlike 'Life During Wartime' by the Talking Heads and 'Weird Fishes/Arpeggi'\nby Radiohead. Not only did the guitars mimic the songs perfectly, Zara's\nbeabadooee-like voice introduces a\nnew sound to the classically male-sung\ntracks. Although the mellow coolness\nof Thom Yorke's voice is challenging,\nshe's able to channel David Byrne's cha-otic-neutral excitations while avoiding\nsounding like an annoying child.\nForabandthathassuchastronggrasp\nover the sounds they produce, members of Quadronaut are refreshingly\nhumble as artists. Their passion for the\nmusic they\u2019re playing entirely changes\nhow you perceive the music. One of\nthe reasons I don't make notes during\ntheir performance of 'Time' by Pink\nFloyd, Jimi Hendrix's 'Little Wing',\nElton John's 'Rocketman' Fleetwood\nMac's'TheChain'issimplybecausethey\nare a captivating band. They reproduce\nPink Floyd's psychedelic sound with\nevery instrument available but in a way\nthat complements each other instead\nof drowning them out. You can catch\ntheir eager side-glances to each other\nthat the music means more than the\naudience reactions \u2013 and in an ideal\nworld, that's exactly how it should be.\nAs much as I would like to elaborate on\nTom's guitar improvisation and use of a\nwhammy arm or Gabe's ability to pull a\nPhil Collins and be the only drummer\nI've seen here to be the lead vocalist in\na song, I want to talk about how they\nare as a band. Unlike every other band\nwe've seen, they are stripped clean of\npretenses, quick quips, and 'dickhead charisma'. Their\ninvestment in their music is palpable in both their performance and their communication as a band.

This discontent amongst Russia\u2019s\nelite attests to the severity of the economic penalties\nPutin has incurred.\nIndeed, the sanctions unleashed by the U.S.-led\ncoalition over the past week - deployed in tranches\nsince Tuesday, each more punishing than the last \u2013 will\nreduce Russia to a pariah and devastate its economy.\nThe sale to Russia of airplane parts, various electronics,\nand equipment essential for the upgrade of oil refineries\nhas been prohibited. As of Thursday, the EU rolled\nout sanctions it claims will affect 70% of the Russian\nbanking sector. Russians are now barred from making\ndeposits exceeding \u20ac100, 000 in EU banks. The latest\nround of sanctions, announced Saturday, target Russia\u2019s\ncentral bank, freezing its $630 billion in foreign\nreserves. This unprecedented step - a nuclear option, so\nto speak - was apparently interpreted by Putin as akin\nto an act of war; an occasion for bringing his own quite\nun-metaphorical nuclear arsenal to the ready.\nAdditionally, the cost to protect against the risks\nof Russian debt has surged. The spread on five-year\ncredit default swaps increased almost eight-fold, where\nit commenced at around 120 basis points (bp) earlier\nthis year. Despite this, due to its extensive oil revenue\nand low debt levels, the likelihood that Russia defaults\non its debt is slim. But this does not assuage fears, as\ninvestors are aware that the sanctions would make it\nimpracticable for them to receive interest or principal\nrepayments from Russia.\nOne of the many sanctions levelled at Putin consists\nin the freezing of \u00a3154bn in assets at VTB, Russia\u2019s\nsecond-largest bank. This blow, inflicted by the US and\nthe UK, has made it a struggle for investors to trade\nin Russian assets due to the withdrawal from global\nmarkets. This means the bank and its subsidiaries will\nnot be able to do any business in the UK or US or with\nits nationals. Swiss wealth management giants, Credit\nSuisse and UBS, have cut the amount they are willing\nto lend to private bank clients using Russian assets as\nan insurance.\nMost surprisingly, Switzerland recently broke its\ndeep-rooted tradition of neutrality and espoused the\nEU\u2019s sanctions against Russia, despite its potential\ndamage to their reputation as a neutral arbiter of\ndiplomatic affairs. To highlight its solidarity with\nUkraine and its people, the Swiss government decided\nto close its airspace to Russian planes and freeze the\nassetsofRussianoligarchsassociatedwiththePresident;\nthus, putting pressure on Putin.\nButwhiledevastationmaybecertainenoughforthe\nRussian economy, the threat that western economies\nmust now contend with is uncertainty.\nThe Ukraine war injects enormous uncertainty into\nfinancial markets. Merryn Somerset-Webb, editor of\nMoneyWeek, notes that whereas financial markets were\nable to withstand other turbulences in global affairs\nin recent years - Trump\u2019s 2017 missile strike against\nSyria, Afghanistan Withdrawal, and nuclear tensions\nwith North Korea among others - Ukraine is different\nbecause Ukraine dominates in the export of certain\nkey metals (rivalled only by Russia), sunflower oil, and\nbarley. None of these other countries export much\nof anything, so their leverage in the global economy\nis negligible. So, the Ukraine crisis will cause more\ninflation than any of these other events, and inflation\nis a leading cause of uncertainty in markets. Then there\nis the question as to whether or not central banks\nwill decide to raise interest rates to counter inflation.\nMarkets cannot know, and thus the uncertainty is\nexacerbated.\nLeyli is a second year Medical Biosciences\nundergraduate at Imperial College London,\nand writes for the Investment Column.\nPutin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine has been met with wide criticism across the world, including sanctions.\nCredits: Jos\u00e9 Pablo Dom\u00ednguez // Unsplash\nCredits: Edoardo Ceriani // Unsplash\nRussia\u2019s largest production level is in the rare metal Palladium, a whopping 43%!\n\n"

    "content": "Apple's \"Walled Garden\" is arguably\nthe biggest reason for its massive\nprofits and market dominance across\nproduct segments. The company aims to\ndo everything possible to ensure its users\ndo not leave the Apple sphere of influence to do anything, with an increasing\nrange of products across audio, digital\nservices, and even finance being released\nto facilitate this.\nIn order to do this effectively, before\ninvesting in the development of a specific product, Apple first allows other\ncompanies to test the market. If strong\ndemand is seen for these products, Apple releases competitors. While this is a\nplaybook followed by many tech companies - Amazon being a notable example\n- the process was pioneered by Apple.\nThe industry term for this procedure is\nknown as \"Sherlocking\", in recognition\nof how Apple killed the third-party software known as Watson by copying its\nfeatures, releasing a clone known as Watson built into MacOS.\nA similar process happened in the\nApril 2021, with the launch of AirTags.\nThese are small circular tracking\ndevices,\nintegrated strongly throughout iOS and\nApple's accessories ecosystem. They are,\nin effect, Apple-built clones of the increasingly popular Tile trackers. Tile is\nan American company, which has been\ndeveloping keychain style trackers since\n2015. It has pioneered the development\nof small, Bluetooth based tracking de-vices, having sold over 35 million in the\ntime since their release. Due to the low\npower of the transmitters on board, the\ntrackers have a short range. This means\nthe technology relies on having a large\nuser base, with phones with the Tile app\nbeing the only way in which a tag can be\nfound.\nApple\u2019s AirTags work in the exact\nsameway,relyingonanexternaldeviceto\ncommunicate the location of the tracker\nwith the outside world. The difference\nhere, however, is that Apple is able to\nleverage the vast number of devices it\nhas sold. If every Tile was purchased by a\ndistinct owner, that would give the Tile\nnetwork 35 million users which could\npass by a missing device and detect it. In\ncontrast, there are over one billion active\niPhone users according to Apple \u2013 all of\nwhich are listening for a nearby Airtag,\nas this functionality is enabled by de-fault. As the effectiveness\nof a small tracker is\ndirectly linked to\nthe size of its\nuser base, by enabling this functionality\nacross every Apple device, Apple have\neffectively killed any competition they\nmight have.\nNot content with giving its own application a massive, artificial advantage,\nApple has also tried to reduce the effectiveness of Tile\u2019s network through\nupdates to iOS. Under the guise of protecting users\u2019 privacy, iOS now warns\nusers that the Tile app will be accessing\ntheir location, warning of a privacy risk,\nand prompts them to disable this access.\nApple\u2019s own system is not subject to the\nsame warnings \u2013 despite collecting the\nsame amount of data and being enabled\nby default. Apple has also limited access\nto the radio chip required to communicate precision location data with newer\niPhones, despite promising that it would\ngive third-party developers the information required by 2019.\nThis, quite naturally, has led to an antitrust complaint by Tile, submitted in\nboth the US and EU. Antitrust cases,\nespecially against Big Tech, are notoriously slow to complete, and the likely\noutcome is the period of time between\nthe launch of AirTags and the ruling of\nthe antitrust case will have allowed Apple to build an unassailable lead in the\nproduct segment. Apple has attempted\nto avert any potential antitrust ruling by\nclaiming it is opening up its network to\nthird-party devices \u2013 however, the conditions behind access are incredibly lim-iting. These device manufacturers would\nhave to abandon their own networks\nand apps, directing every user to Apple\u2019s\nversion instead \u2013 effectively preventing\nnon-Apple users from using any tracking\ndevice.\nApple\u2019s dedication to preventing users outside its bubble from interacting\nwith devices and services has had an\nunintentional effect. With the massive\nnetwork that Apple has now deployed,\nevery AirTag is the perfect tool for a\nstalker. For users with iPhones, a notification is sent if an AirTag that is not\nregistered to them is detected as following their movement for a period of time.\nHowever, the stalker, as the owner of the\nAirTag,candisableitoncethevictimhas\nreached their destination. This prevents\nthese notifications from being sent. For\nusers with Android phones, even this\nprotection does not exist.\nFor a period of five months after the\ntracker\u2019s release, Android users had effectively no way of detecting any AirTags\nbeing used to track their location. In December 2021, Apple attempted to remedy this by releasing an app on the Play\nStore, which when opened will scan for\nany AirTags in tracking mode, and then\nif detected continuously for 10 minutes,\ndisplay their location on screen. The app\nhas done very little to allay concerns. It\nhas 500,000 installs \u2013 out of an Android\nuser base of over 3 billion devices \u2013 and\nis only active when the app is open. Not\nonly does the potential victim have to\nsuspect they are being stalked to install\nthe app, but they also have to open it on\na regular basis to check if it is happening\nat that moment in time. The app, which\nhas just 1.8 stars on the Play Store, is described by reviewers as being a \"buggy\nmess\". As stated by one reviewer, \u201cit feels\nas if Android users are being punished\nfor not having an iPhone.\u201dTo add insult\nto injury, Apple\u2019s UK website directs users to \u201ccontact their local United States\nlaw enforcement\u201d if they believe they are\nbeing stalked.\nDespite the convenience they bring,\nAirTags\u2019 anticompetitive nature and Apple\u2019s woeful attempt at protecting public\nsafety shows that they are a product that\ncannot be allowed to exist.\nFRIDAY 4TH MARCH 2022\nSCIENCE\n13\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe problem with AirTags\nShrey Bohra Tech Writer\nOpinion: Tech Writer Shrey Bohra discusses his concerns about Apple's AirTags\nHOW DO AIRTAGS WORK?\n1) The AirTag constantly\nbroadcasts a unique identifier over\nBluetooth\n2) Every passing Apple device\nlistens to this identifier and\nrecords the location where it\n\"heard\" it\n3) This location is uploaded to\nApple's servers and shared with\nthe owner of the AirTag\nPhoto credit: KKPCW, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n"

    "content": "Acasias and ants\nAcacias are plants that live in African savannas, arguably one of the\nworst places to be a tree with succulent\nleaves because the savannas are dry,\nhot, and crowded with large herbivores\nsuch as giraffes. Acacias, however, have\ndeveloped a strategy to help them sur-vive. They secrete a sweet liquid, rich\nin sugars, that attracts and feed ants.\nIn exchange for the food, the ants protect the acacia. Consequently, ants and\nthe acacia establish a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationship. However,\nit must be noted that both parties are\nparticipating in the relationship out of\nself-interest; the amount of sugar the\nacacia secrete and the protection the\nants provide are in constant negotiation.\nSometimes, acacia will try to offer less\nsugar with the expectation of obtaining\nthe same level of protection in return.\nThis could work out if other sources of\nfood are scarce, leaving the ants with no\nalternative. On the other hand, if food is\nplentiful, the ants become looters, trying\nto take as much sugar as possible from\nthe acacia before leaving it. Astonishingly, some species of acacia also engage in\nfoul play. The liquid they secrete for the\nants contains substances that inhibit the\naction of an enzyme found in the gut of\nantscalledinvertase.Antswithoutactive\ninvertase cannot absorb sugars properly\nand hence, die. However, the \u201cfriendly\u201d\nacacia will not allow that to happen by\nproducing invertase that is added to the\nsweet liquid given to ants, increasing the\ndependency of ants to the acacia. Sometimes you need to both cause a problem\nand offer the solution in order survive!\nTongue-eating isopods and\nfish\nIn the first case of the acacia and ants,\nboth benefitted from the relationship\nfrom the very beginning. The following\nexample describes a parasite that is capable of effectively becoming an organ of\nthe host. The tongue-eating isopods are\ncertainly some of the strangest organisms on the planet. These parasites enter\ninto fish through their gills. The males\nstay there, while the females, much big-ger, travel to the mouth, where they attach to the tongue and start sucking the\nfish\u2019s blood. Over time, the fish\u2019s tongue\ndoes not receive enough nutrients and\nwithers, falling off the fish\u2019s body. Without a tongue, the fish would no longer\nbe able to ingest food and would die.\nHowever, the female tongue-eating iso-pod occupies the space of the tongue. Its\nlong and plane body can function exactly like a real tongue. This is by no means\nan altruistic action on the part of the\nparasite because it feels sorry for eating\nthe tongue of the fish! The tongue-eat-ing isopod wants to keep the fish alive\nbecause its own survival depends on it.\nFurthermore, remember the males in the\ngills?

The most well-known case\nis the lichen, a product of the association\nof an alga and a fungus. However, most\nmutualistic relationships are facultative.\nThis means that the organisms can perfectly live on their own, but with lower\nsurvival rates. Mutualism is more common in harsh environmental conditions\nbecause cooperation and specialisation\nprovide a better, safer outlook than if\neach individual organism existed sepa-rately. Besides, the environment is challenging enough and one more friend is\none less enemy. On the other hand, if\nresources are plentiful, isolation of the\norganisms is preferable. Cooperation\nwould mean that the resources have to\nbeshared.Insomecases,however,ithap-pens that resources are plentiful, but one\norganism is still dependent upon anoth-er.

The plant\nwould have a surplus of these resources\nand would no longer require the assistance of the fungi. In this case, the relationship breaks down; the plant, enjoying an increased supply of minerals and\nwater, grows further, taking even more\nresources from the environment \u2013 not\nonly minerals and water, but also other\nessential nutrients, such as nitrogen.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nThe best of friends: symbiotic relationships in nature\nWriter Wang Guo explores some fascinating symbiotic relationships in nature and how they can break down\nMeat ants on Austrochardia acaciae, a type of acacia\nIf you look closely at the mouth of this fish, you will see a tongue-eating louse (Cymothoa exigua)\nwhere the fish's tongue should be!\nPhoto credit: Marco Vinci/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0\nPhoto credit: Mark Marathon/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n"
