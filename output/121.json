    "content": "2\nFELIX TED SMITH On April 1st,1927, Mr. L.E. Smith\"Ted\" - took up his duties as I.C. bar-man, in succession to Rosy, the barmaid*\nHe had previously been a butler valet\nand, finding his work completely new\nand strange, he thought he wouldn t last\na week. Now, thirty-one years later,\nhe is due to retire after long and honourable ser vio e. The price-list on Ted's first day\nmakes thirsty reading:-Beer . . . . . . 6d. per pint\nWhisky . . . . . 8d.a tot\nBrandy 10d Sherry . . . . . 8d Champagne . . . 13/Od. to 18/Od.\na bottle\nand Best Jamaican cigars a bob I Things are rather different now\nbut Ted finds that I.C.'s prodigious\nthirst is unaffected by the rising oost\nof living.\nBeing barman has been far mare\nto Ted than just a job. It has been\na vocation, a hobby of great interest.\nHe has kept in touch with many old\nstudents and looks after the visitors'\nbooks and records of the various old\nstudents' reunion dubs with pride\nand pleasure. He has an uncanny\nmemory far old students' faces. Frequently he has recognized them after\nmore than twenty years absence and unerringly produces the right pot. He\no on side rs the proudest moment of his\nlife to have been whan elected an\nHonorary Life member of Imperial\nCollege Union, last year.\nTed has served many famous people\nin the I.C. Bar. General Smuts was\nonce adorned with the Bull Club oha in( yet to be allotted a place in the\nnew bar) and had to buy drinks all round. The Springbok's Rugger Team of\n1952, Lawrence of Arabia, the Earl ef\nAthlone, H.G. Wells, Sir William Penney\n(who used to may outside \"right for\nI.C.), Lord Claud Hamilton (e quer ry to Queen Mary), Lord Dawson of Fenn\nand Tiger Tensing have all patronised\nthe I.C. Bar. So too have Stanley\nHolloway, Arthur Askey and the Western\nBrothers, who appeared in pre-war\nGuilds Carnival cabarets!\nTed also remembers the days when\nthe local polios were frequent friendly\nvisitors to the bar, for darts mato aes and other occasions. November 5th,1949, ended all that - you can still see the soars of I.C.'s fire i a front\nof Albert - but Ted remembers when a fierce Irish meeting was taking place\nin the Albert Hall and the whole of\nthe Hall and Prince Consort Road were\nbarred by mounted police. No-One\nwas allowed through except Ted, who\nwas given a special mounted polios\nescort by a, sergeant who recognised\nhim, having enjoyed many good even-in- in the oo lle ge bar.\nTed recalls, rather wistfully\nit would seam, the pre-war days when\nthe whole of I.C. consisted of about\n800 students. Residents assembled\nin the front hall te dine together\nat 7 p.m. every night, led in by the\nwarden. Lateooaars had to eat at a side-table and no-one was allowed in\nrefectories without a collar, tie and\njacket.\nDuring the war Ted could not\nenter his own bar without a military\npermit, renewed monthly, as the hostel\nand Union were taken over by the military for eighteen months. Ted is\nproud to relate that many of his\ncustomers formed an I.C. company of\nthe Home Guard and on May 13th,1944, were in the King's Guard at Buckingham\nPalace.\nUntil Easter, 1954, Ted operated\nin the original bar situated where the\ncloakroom now resides. Although recalling the old bar with affection,\nTed finds the same homely atmosphere\nia the new one wh i oh he describes as\nsplendid in every way. He and Charles\nBristow were the last to leave the old\nbar on the famous Last Night, wh i oh only a few current students can now\nremember.\nIf most of this article seems to\nbe o ono er ned with life and events at\nI.C. more than about Ted, it is because\nTed has always been so much a part of\nI.C. life and I.C. life has always\nmeant so much to Ted. He loves talking\nabout I.C. and reminiscing on his\nexperiences here but ia much more reticent about himself. However, we\ndid discover that he served for six\nyears in the army, 1914-20, and in\n1921 received a letter from the War\noffice asking him why he had never\njoined up! Ted has been an ardent\nsupporter of Chelsea for fifty years,\nrarely missing a home game.\nTed and Mrs. Smith plan, even-tu ally, to move from their present\nhome near Victoria to somewhere on\nthe o east. They will take with them\nthe very best wishes of many Imperial\nCollege students, past and present,\nfar a long, happy and well-earned\nretirement.\nI.C. will not be the same place\nwithout you, Ted. An re voir, good\nluck and many thanks far your immeasurably large services to Imperial\nCollege Union over many years.\nCHINESE EVEN/ NG The Chinese Sooiety made their\nfirst mark on College life on Nay 2nd when they provided some very good\nentertainment i a the fern of a Chinese\nEvening. A lot of hard work was put\ninto this venture by a Club which has\nbeen in existence only a few months.\nStarting with the inevitable\nfilms the evening continued with a talk en Chinese Art by a prominent\nChinese painter. Watched by aa audience of 200, his wife then gave a skilful demonstration.\nIn the interval I.C. was introduced te Chinese cooking - Mr. Meoney\nplease note and provide chop sticks.\nAfter the feed had disappeared, washed\ndown by China tea, there fallowed entertainment from the stage, Miss Leung\nexcelling as a dancer and pianist,\nand a redoubtable o on jure r product*\nsome exceedingly fiendish tricks.\nNEW FURNITURE FOR SNACK BAR\nAt the Council meeting on amy 15th, Br. Weale presented the financial\nstatement, which showed a bala no e in\nhand of \u00a3389. The President, who had\ndevoted much thought to this matter,\npointed out that the furniture in the\nSnack Bar was in dire need of replace-ment. The College had estimated the\noost ef doing this at \u00a3400, but seemed\nto be hesitating at the prospect ef\nspending this sum (although the new\nblue Formica counter top had cost\nabout \u00a3250), Accordingly he proposed\nthat the Union should contribute \u00a3200\ntowards new furniture, which would be\nsimilar to that installed at Harllagton this year. The proposal was ear-ned.\nThe Bookstall Committee will\nShortly submit to the Rector its recommendations for the future books tall en the island site. These in o lude a fitting room, a large notice-board\nfor the advertisement of second-hand\nbooks, and a barber's shop stocking\ntoilet requisites. Tobacco and cigarettes would be carried, but not\nconfectionery, and no more sporting\ngoods than at present.\nIt was announced that the grand\npiano now in the Guilds Council Boca\nwill be transferred to 178, Queen's Gate when its present home is demo-li shed. Accordingly it will not be\nnecessary to hold lunch-time ree it als and Antony Hopkins' lectures in the\nConcert Hall, as was feared at one\ntime.\nThere will be a meeting ef the\nI.C. union on June 10th. ANGST ANGER The recent Touchstone weekend\nled by Mr. Ormerod Greenwood took as\nits title \"Angst and Ancer.\" The\ndiscussions revolved around two books\n\"The Unquiet Grave\" by Pallnurus\n(Cyril Connolly) and \"Look Back in\nAneer\" by John Osborne. In his introduction Mr. Greenwood showed us\nsomething of the ba oke c round of the\ntwo writers, how the former had had\nbeen to Eton whereas Osborne had\nbeen at a state soho ol and was largely self-educated. Connolly, born in\n1903, shared similar views to W.H. Auden and had a mature outlook on\nlife; Osborne, on the other hand,\ntended to be rather of the angry\nyou nm man complex. These opposing upbringings and outlooks showed\nthemselves ia their writings.\nIn the discussion that followed\nfive pairs of contrasting ideas from\nthe two books were considered. Each\npair o ono er ned an essentially similar subject, and Mr. Greenwood asked\nquestions to suit each subject.\nFirstly we were asked to define\ncivilisation and to express our attitude to it. This produced many\ninteresting arguments, ranging from\nthe historical spread of civilisation from one country to another to\nthe belief that civilisation only\noccurred if the natives of that particular country believed themselves\nto be civilised. Could the ancient\nEgyptians really be considered civilised since their system of government was as undemocratic as possible?\nDiscussion rambled over many allied\nquestions; by and large no good\ndefinition was reached. General\ndiscussion on religion also developed in reply to another question,\nbut it was on the sub j eot of marriage that opinions ran rife. The\nMedical Research Council's views\non pre-marital promiscuity were\nquoted time and time again, and\nmuch discussion took place on the\nmoral and social implication of\nsuch behaviour.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX PUBLIC SERVICES PRESENT\nHOW TO AVOID THE CALL UP Aa everyone knows, the resources\nof the Joint (Recruiting Board) are\nat the present time pitted against\nthose students who have hitherto\nevaded the perils of National Service.\nIn order to lessen the odds we present\nthis exclusive guide to the methods of\nbeating the army without actually resorting to warfare. This summary has\nbeen prepared from the documents of\nthe Government itself.\nThere is one, and only one, way\nin which a man can completely free\nhimself of National Service obligations\nand that is to fail the medical. Unfortunately it is not normally possible\nto apply for a medio al without mn king oneself liable for immediate o all up\nif found medically fit, and so this is\na gamble for very high stakes indeed.\nHowever, in cases where failure seems\ncertain a medical can be arranged without obligation (that is, even if you\nhave already obtained deferment) provided you can get your doctor to support your claim. This is well worth\ndoing and if you think there is any\nchance of it happening to you go and\nhave a chat with your doctor - there's nothing to lose and all to gain. Remember you don't have to be a cripple -just Grade 3.\nAlmost as good is indefinite\ndeferment. The snag here is that the\ngraduate must remain in a position\nfor which indefinite deferment is granted until he reaches the ripe old\nage of 26. Comparative safety is afforded by oe rta in Government posts\nin the Ministry of Supply, Admiralty,\nAtomic Energy Authority Establishments\nand the Colonial Office, also work on\nhigh-priority defence projects in industry. However, in these oases men\nwithout National Service obligations\nare usually recruited in preference\nto those who have. Those with a \"First\", or with a \"Second\" and a higher degree (M. Sc., Ph.D., etc.)\nare indefinitely deferred if they\ntake up a position in the United\nKingdom for which their qu alf io at ions are required. However, P.G. study or\nresearch may be done abroad if desired.\nSchool-teaching is open to science\ngraduates and carries indefinite\ndeferment but, in the case of Physics\nand Mathematics only, a first or second\nclass Honours degree is required.\nThere is no deferment for University\nor Technical College lectures. Agriculture and coal mining offer the only\nother opportunities.\nHaving exhausted all known ways\nof avoidance we come to deferment in\nits literal sense. It is important\nto note that you cannot stay at College\nuntil you are 26. Regulations clearly\nstate that deferment will not be granted for courses which end after the\napplicant's26 th birthday. Deferment\nia granted for Graduate Apprenticeships\nin Industry and for post graduate study\nor research at University. Those with\npure science degrees who do Graduate\napprenticeships must study part-time\nfor the relevant professional qualifications (usually one day a week is granted far this).\nThose who are thinking of fleeing\nthe country should note that deferment\ncan only be granted for government\nposts and certain post graduate courses\nabroad. Those who leave without telling\nanyone are liable for National Servioe\nin this country until they are old men\nof 36 and probably liable where they\nsettle also.\nWe regret that we are unable to\naccept responsibility for the Ministry\nof Labour and National Servioe. But\nif you're wondering whether it's worth\nall the trouble - oo ul d you live on\nL/6d.a day?\nSMITH OF THE ANTARCTIC\nMartin Smith (ex-Chem. Dept.)\nsailed last October for the Antarctic 7\nin the \"John Bisooe.\" After a very\ninteresting voyage, calling at the\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia,\nhe arrived in January at the base in\nGrahamland where he will spend the\nnext two years. He is working for\nthe Falkland Island Dependencies\nSurvey as a meteorologist, but much\nof his spare time is spent making a film about Antarctica.\nMartin would be glad to receive\nletters from any of his friends at\nI.C.( especially Photo. Soc. and\nMountaineering Club members). His\naddress is: Argentine Islands,\nGrahamland,\nvia Port Stanley,\nFalkland Islands,\nSouth Atlantic.\nLettera should be posted before the\nend of September, if they are to\nreach him on the next supply ship.\n\u2022^ux d \u00ab Xuuad w Jq US-[TBI e \u00abq iau or n jo en rB A eq: \u00bb\n. 'je qo^ OQ is\u00abis oui g NELSON PROFILES THE ED/T OR \"All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players.\"\nFELIX is the stage on which the news\nand views of I.C. are recorded and\ndiscussed. The Editor is our stage\nmanager, and over the past year Peter\nLevin has carried out this task with\ngreat acumen. It might however be\nappropriate to question Shakespeare's words, for even though FELIX is produced by a happy team of workers, far\nmore of each issue has been written\nand produced by Peter himself than\nis generally realised.\nEditors too frequently have their\nexits and their entrances but Peter has\nheld the stage for the record time of\none year.Each Editor adds that little\nbit of something that makes FELIX a living organism. Having a facile wit\nis one requirement; a sense of responsibility is needed to balance this\nand in addition it is very essential\nto remain in a state of amity with the\nrest of the Board. Peter discovered\nthis and repented after he had, in a light-hearted moment, sacked half the\nmembers of his staff.\nOne of his amusements, between\nFELICES, is said to be Electron Diffraction - pursued in the Chemical\nEngineering Department,and fortunately his enthusiasm for research is\nsomewhat less erratic than his sleeping hours.\nFar be it from us to enquire the reason but his hostel room ia frequently\na blaze of light at four in the morning and Lily, his bedder, has many ti mes had her routine up a et by not being\nable to tidy his room until midday.\nWe would like to think that Peter was\nearnestly engaged upon his studies but\nthe many occasions he has been a een immaculately dressed in the evenings\nforce us to draw other conclusions.\nA staunch critic of Union cater-ing, he is becoming a proficient cook-sausage soup being his speciality.\nOriginally a Physicist, his inventive\npowers have extended to an inductive\nearth for his radio, and visitors to\nRoom 18 are likely to hang themselves\non the twisted coils of wire trailing\nfrom the ceiling.\nNot the least of his virtues and\nvices is a propensity for completely\ndisarming remarks, most of the better\nones being unfit for publication but\nlosing none of their poignancy for\nbeing dropped quite irrelevantly into\na conversation.\nOf his sporting prowess little la\nknown, but a recent vicious attack on\nthe a quash courts may testify to the\nin ten a it y with which he tackles any new\nproblem. The latest of the a e is Josephine (his scooter) with whose help\nhe has been able to do much more personal reporting for FELIX beyond the\nbounds of the College. Within it he\nhas penetrated to the farthest corners.\nThe Rector cannot let slip a hint\nwithout >ELIX being there to pick it up. Should an ICWArian drop ac langer FELIX la outside the door. The ear\nof FELIX is in Council, the eye of FELIX in the Planning Office, - and in\nall of these guises can the Editor be\nfound.\nBut although you may not have noticed him listening, when h lao baer vat lons were stated in his Editorials\nyou have read, you have commented, and\nsome of you have even thought'.\nIn conclusion the Editor wi a he a me to state that now the mantle of\nFELIX has fallen from him and there\nare one or two things he still wishes to do, He has every intention of\nliving to 120.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX5 SHEER POETRY\nSir,\nI feel bound to thank Mr. Goodenough for crystal lising the rather\nnebulous illusions Of grandeur that\nprovide many of us with an inexpensive substitute for a loo hol, but I hope he will forgive a few comments\non an idea that is I admit basically\nsound.\nFirstly, he is perhaps a little too intolerant of the barbarism\naround him. Surely it speaks well for\nhis inferiors that some of them have\nat least become conscious of their\nsocial and moral inferiority. Mr.\nGoodenough should try to overcome\nhis natural repugnance and attempt\nto improve the people he has no wish\nto know in their present state: perhaps this is his vocation. There is something Promethean in the splendid\nisolation in which he suffers.\nThen there is the problem of admission to the Upper - or, of course,\nEight - Union. Our forebears may\nhave been able to buy civilisation as\nMr. Goodenough would like to do with\nhis proposed higher subscription -my own forebears failed while his\npresumably succeeded: this generation\nis less fortunate. The Upper Union\nwould soon be full of utter parvenus.\nI would suggest an accent test were\nit not for the fact that my own,\nSouthend-Greenslade, might exclude\nme. Probably personal recommendation\nis the safest way. Perhaps we may\nhope that in due course WestcliffImperial-Upper union will become\nsecond only to Eton-Balliol-Athaeneun\nas a key to the Establishment.\nWhether the U. U.( Are you/Too/U?) would in fact enable us to avoid\nbeing annoyed by the mare brutal\nseems doubtful, because if I know\nthe more brutal they are likely to\npersecute the U. U.( Oh, boy!) even\nmore than they persecute its prospective members. The beasts!\nTours extremely sincerely,\nFred Wheeler.\nNUCLEAR DISARMAMENTDear Sir,\nWhilst feeling ran very high with\nregard to the 'Ban the Bomb* meeting,\nIo on side rit deplorable that 'educated'\npeople found it necessary to tear down\nthe notices.\nAn act even mare deplorable was\nthat of a prominent Union official who\napproached members of the Hockey Club\nafter t heir Annual Dinner last Thursday\nand endeavour ed to persuade them to\ninterfere with the meeting.\nWhatever one's shade of opinion\nmay be, it would seem reprehensible\nto apply suo h methods.\nYours sincerely,\nB. Marshall.\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Sir,\nAs an attempt to publicise the\nmeeting on Nuclear Disarmament last\nweek, posters were put up in the\nUnion and around College. In add i tion, a personal letter1 was posted\nin the College Racks for each\nindividual member of I.C. Most of\nthe posters were ripped down and\nfew of the letters reached the\npeople to whom they were addressed.\nThis, presumably , is the work\nof some unknown extremist in the\nCollege, to whom personal liberty\nmeans very little.( For this is indeed a breach of individual\nliberty and free expression.)\nHowever, as a result of this\ncertain members of the Union executive were informed and asked to\ninvestigate the matter. Surprisingly\nenough these individuals seemed reconciled to the stats of affairs and\nwere very reluctant to investigate\nfurther. While members of the Union\nexecutive may not agree with the\naims of the meeting, should su oha serious matter as the theft of\nletters from racks and the general\nsu press ion of individual initiative\n(w hio hI. C. badly needs) be left to\ngo unnoticed?\nTours sincerely,\nPeter Smith.\nDear Sir,\nMay I, with your permission, take\nthis opportunity of expressing my contempt and disgust at the base way in which certain political factions are\nselfishly exploiting a great many\nthinking moralists. I am aware that\nI am not alone in these thoughts and\nI hope this letter expresses the\nfeelings of many more people.\nIn your last issue my name appeared\non a list attached to a letter concerning nuclear disarmament. I was assured\nthat the so-called nuclear disarmament\ncommittee was purely a non-official\nand non-poli to al organisation, but\nonce more the inevitable happens, for\nsome members of the committee have\nattached it to the Socialist Society,\nnot, say, the Debating Society. As\na former Chairman of the S. C.C.I must point out that, as should be the\ncase, there has been no mention of the\nSocialist Society on any notices or\nillegal circulars which have been\ndistributed around the Union.\nMy reasons for supporting nuclear\ndisarmament are philosophical and\npersonal, not political, and I am\nprepared to discuss them with anybody\nprivately. To be consistent with my\nviews I would sooner die in a nuclear\nwar than allow any political faction\nat all to achieve another quits different aim by attaching itself to this\nMORAL question. To say 'ban the\nH bomb' for myself is merely to assert\nthe freedom of the individual to live\nas he wishes far the common freedom\nof human life. To attach this question\nto sny political party or 'cause' is to negate that freedom.\nI wish, formally, to renounce all connection with the I.C. \"Nuclear\nDisarmament Committee.\"\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\nA.M. Hodgson.\nST9ZS9DI\n12\u00a3 * DISCOUNT\nALL MAKES GUARANTEED\nCONTACT C.G.

Wallace.\n(President R.S. M.) Dear Sir,\nWith reference to the complaint\nmade by the President of R.S. M.I would point out that the announcement\nwas inserted by me and not intended\nto be anonymous.\nThe organisation of this event\ndoes not, in fact, lie entirely with\nthe R.S. M. as it is held only at the\ninvitation of the Dramatic Society.\nThis is because the Sooiety has to\nmake special arrangements for a Mines\nNight, wh i oh must not be a licensed\nperformance.\nI can only reaffirm ray previous announcement; it is unlikely that\nthere will be further Mines Nights.\nTours faithfully,\nL.J.

C., gave a thought-provoking address on \"Moral Problems\nin a Scientific Age.\"\nProfessor Jones pointed out that\nmoral problems are different in a scientific age and questioned whether\ntechnological advances necessarily bene-fit mankind. He cited the Sputnik,\ntelevision and the H bomb as examples\nof those which do not.\nA problem for the scientist to-day\nis when to work on immoral things, and\nmany students offer crude, almost subhuman arguments on this point. Science\nprovides a model of honest thought, but\nunfortunately this model is not always\nfollowed. Professor Jones illustrated\nhis point with an imaginary Parliamentary exchange on the topic of the\nHouse of Commons bath plug. The transition from this highly technical issue\nto the accusation of \"fellow travelling\"\nwas painfully realistic.\nIn the lively discussion which\nfollowed points raised included the\ndefinition of \"moral* and the problem\nof how to combat muddled thought.\nOfficers elected at the.meeting\nwere:-President M.J.

    "content": "4 FELIX EDITOR I PETER LEVIN FELIX\nCIRCULATION\n1500\nTHAT QUESTIONNAIRE The response to the questionnaire in our last issue was rather mixed. While\nthe number returned (150) hardly permits of a statistical analysis, the replies\ndo give a reasonable indication of the overall state of affairs and provide some\ninteresting comparisons between departments.\n\"Do you consider that I.C. provides the right type of education?\" Yes - 53;\nYes, a good scientific and technological training - 21; No - 62. The Civil Engineers were the most satisfied and the Physicists the least. Of those who replied\nin the negative, 59 felt strongly enough to give a definite \"No\" to question 5:\n\"Would you recommend anyone to take the degree course in your department?\" The\nPhysics and Chemistry departments showed clear majorities against recommendation,\nand a similar trend was apparent among the Aero Engineers.\n\"Would you like to see more attention paid to the quality of the teaching?\"\nYes - 121; No - 23. The most common reservation: \"Lecturing is wanted, not\nteaching - go to a polytechnic for that.\" The department of Electrical Engineering singled out professors for criticism, and was the only one to do so.\n\"Do lecturers take sufficient interest in your work?\" Yes, on the whole -47; No - 73. Only one Physicist in five was satisfied, and only one Mechanical\nEngineer in three. \"Would more personal contact be desirable?\" Yes - 104; No21. By far the happiest departments in this respect were Mathematics and Geology,\nespecially the latter: \"The classes are small and a friendly atmosphere prevails\nbetween students and staff. Field trips encourage this as they provide an opportunity for exchange of views on top los of all kinds.\" Several of those who approved the principle of more personal contact were sc ep tio al as to its usefulness.\n\"A good tutoring system calls for good tutors - more contact with this lot is\nuseless.\" One first-year Physicist had had no tutorials this year. Tutors whose\nknowledge appeared restricted to their research and tutors who showed no personal\ninterest occurred in most departments.\n\"Does your department tend to discourage participation in College activities?\"\nYes -31; Yes, by virtue of the quantity of work expected - 12; No - 103. The\noutstanding department was that of Chemistry, where only three out of seventeen\nfelt that other activities were not discouraged, Some departments in Guilds reported positive encouragement, notably Mechanical Engineering.\nComplaints of \"cramming\" and an excessively large syllabus came chiefly from\nCivil Engineers and Chemists. There was a total of 20 requests for a four-year\ncourse.\nCONCLUSIONS \u2014\nIn drawing any conclusions from the results of this questionnaire it must\nbe borne in mind that those who find fault with the present system are more likely to have replied. Nevertheless, the fact that there are 120 people in this\nCollege who think that something ought to be done about the teaching and 60 who\nwould not recommend their o our sos, can give no grounds for oom place ney. What is\nthe remedy?\nOn 20 questionnaires were comments that students lacked initiative: \"The\ntraining at I.C. is good, and the facilities for students to educate themselves\nare very good.\" This eri tie is m is perhaps justifiable. 104 students think that\nmore personal contact would be desirable; is it really so difficult to make that\ncontact? Could not our untutored Physicist have got up and done something about\nhis position? The answer to this seems to lie In the general opinion of the\nquality of the teaching. When five students in six think that the teaching Is\nnot all It should be, it is hardly likely that they will be stimulated to seek\nany closer contact.\nThere would therefore seem to be a case for bringing to I,C. men whose vocation is university teaching, as dist i not from academic research, but this will\ncall for students with the will and mental ability to take full advantage of such\na stimulus. Of course, there will always be some who will content themselves\nwith the word-perfect memo rising of lecture notes, and a radical overhaul of the\nselection system will be needed to ensure that a minimum number of these get here\nin the first place. At the other end, a radical overhauling of the system of\nawarding degrees will be\" needed to ensure that the right men get them.\nThis is the last FELIX of the session, and my last as Editor. It has been\nmy privilege to work with an extremely energetic and efficient Board, who have\nmade every effort to bring you complete coverage of all \"news, views and topics\nef the moment.\" Next session the blue pencil will be wielded by B.F.

The Exploration Society will be fully\ninformed of all arrangements and it is hoped that Board and Society will be mutually complementary. Any enquiries can be addressed to Dr. P.P. Taylor of the\nCivil Engineering Department.\nThe Exploration Board has announced the award of an interim grant of \u00a3600\nfor a proposed expedition to Peru in the summer of 1959. The intention is that\nsix people will visit the area around the Nudo de Apolo-bamba, near the Bolivian\nborder, the objects being to explore, map and carry out gla cio log l cal Investigations. Geoff Bratt, one of the 1957 Earakoram expedition, Is among the organ-is ers. The interim grant will enable planning to be started, but the final cost\nmay well be in the region of \u00a31000 even with considerable outside backing. Although, as a result, there will be no large sums available for other expeditions\nnext year, it is hoped to do something for one or two small parties.\nHEWS PLASH: JON STEPHENSON WILL GIYE A TALE ON ANTARCTICA OH JUNE 12th. THREE EXPEDITIONS\nTHIS SUMMER\nProvided that sufficient good\nschemes are suggested, the principal\nlimitation is that of finding enough\nmoney to pay for expeditions. Following upon the generous donations given\nto the Board by the Governing Body\nand the Union to launch the 1957\nKarakoram Expedition, they have now\ngiven us annual grants of \u00a31000 and\n\u00a3200 respectively. This enables us\nto think ahead a little and the\ngeneral policy wh i oh has emerged is that we \u00abh \u00abn be in a position to mount\nmajor expeditions every three or four\nyears, giving more limited support to\nsmall well-balanced scientific expeditions in the intervening years. If\nwe are lucky then major expeditions\ncan occur more frequently. This is\nan \"in between\" year, but we have\nnevertheless made grants to enable\nexpeditions to go to Ghana, Iceland\nand Norway.\nThe Ghana Expedition will be a follow-up of the successful one last\nyear. The party of from six to eight\nthird year botanists and zoologists\nwill be led by Bob Starrock and will\nbe away for three months. By making\neconomies, mainly in travelling ex-pens es, this year's expedition will\nonly cost a little over half as much\nas last year's. The Board has given\na grant of \u00a3500 and a number of\nother substantial grants have been\nreo eiv ed from interested outside\norganisations. The expedition will\nbe based in the Bobiri Reserve near\nKumasi and will study problems relating to the breakdown of dead vegetable\nmatter in tropical conditions, some\nof the lesser known cocoa diseases and\npotential carriers of Bilharsia. They\nare taking a cine-camera and hope to\nmake a film about their work and sur-rounding s. The Iceland Expedition is differently constituted, its interests being\ngeology and surveying. It will be led\nby Dr. George Walker (Geology) and will\no on s is t of nine persons drawn from\nseveral departments: it will be away\nfor about ten weeks. The geologists\nwill work on the Kirkjobal pen in sul s, on the east oo a st of Iceland, where\nthe base camp will be situated. From\nthere the rest of the party will range\nup and down the east oo a st levelling\nthe raised beaches which occur along\nthe fjords. The Board gave this expedition a grant of \u00a3150 and it has\nbeen generously supported by the\nRoyal Geographical Society and the\nEverest Foundation.\nBotanists and zoologists seem to\nbe particularly active in the exp lora Continued on page 4\nGUILD SELECT OFFICERS On Thursday Kay 13thC.& held their Annual General Meeting,\ngraced by the presence of old man\nChadwick himself, followed by the\nField Cup Race. The main item on\nthe Agenda was the election of\nofficers for next session. For the\nfirst time in three years there were\ntwo nominations for the Presidency,\nDave Clark (Aero.) being elected in\na fairly even fight against George\nMartin. The others officers \u00a3or\n1958-59 are:\nVice-President .\nHon. Sec. \u2022 . .\nHon. Jun. Treas.\nI.C. Council\nRep. . .\nJon Blok\nColin Frenoh\nPat Bruce\nMarian Bianek\nThe Water-babies\nThe elections were followed\nby the President's report on the\nelections, reviewing C.&G.'s success in both sporting and social\nfields.\nJohn Sheldon then gave details\nof the Field Cup Race. It was to be\na two legged treasure hunt; logs were\nto be used,being more expend i ble than\nthe boats which generally had to be\nfound by Asdic when the chaos ensuing\nfrom this annual sport race had sub-sided. The first object to be retrieved,\nfloating somewhere in the Serpentine\nwould give a clue to the second object.\nThey must then be transported to\nGuilds and the winning department would\nbe rewarded with a crate of beer and\nthe cup.\nLater, a mortally afflicted, and\nuncontrollably twitching Guildsman\ntook occasion to draw the President's attention to a malignant disease wh i oh was rampaging through the first floor\nof the Hostel. Mr. Mike Gorb, with\nOne leg horizontal, his eyes rolling\nand with palpitating bosom, declared\nthat he had successfully overcome the\nmalady.\nThe A.G.M. was terminated by an\nharmonious rendering of \"Boomelaka.\"\nAEROS WIN FIELD CUP\nThe teams assembled in Exhibition\nRoad and were sent away from a short\nshot from Sheldon. The swimming teams\nand logs were soon afloat - the\nChemicals, last year's winners, did a neat flanking movement and were first\nashore only to face a fierce onslaught\nfrom the other departments.\nThe Aeros, unobserved, got theirs\nto President-Elact Dave Clark who took\nflight to the Albert Memorial and presented it to a waiting motor-bike .\nThe second object hidden around the\nMemorial had already been taken to\nGuilds - the Aeros had won.\nA scroll was presented te them\nand appropriately, together with the\ntwo objects,was suspended from an\nH filled balloon and released into\nthe upper atmosphere by Miss Hilary\nMatthews of the Keen. Eng. department.\n\n"

Always\non the scene at Morphy Day and Sports\nDay, he recently distinguished himself\nat the latter occasion by winning the\nstaff race. He is64. While there have been but two\nClerks to the Governors, Colonel Lowry\nis the only one known to have climbed\na lamp post in Prince Consort Ed., another of his past-times at which eyewitnesses report considerable aptitude.\nThe College will not lose him completely as he is doing some research into\nthe records, and It is hoped that a book may be forthcoming as a result.\nFEU X SIL WOOD SATURN ALIA The Annual Country House Ball was\nheld on Friday 16th May at Silwood\nPark.

Brown. On May\n13th some of them were apparently\ninsufficiently punctual in returning\nto the lab. far a practical class,\nand they were asked to sign a sheet\nof paper and state their times of\narrival. The majority having given\nthis as 2 o 'clock, Mrs. Brown then\ninserted the correct times, which she\nhad carefully noted, and made them\nsign to these.\nThe remedy for this situation is obvious. Mrs. Brown should be made\nto write r vt two thousand times:\n\"I.C. is a University, not a soho ol.\" AU SCCOURS\nM OYEZ'. OYEZ'.

The dancers\nwere able to rest in the seats round\nthe balcony above the hall and observe\nbelow, the more energetic guests. The\nafternoon had been very blustery but\nby 12.0 as the guests walked across\nto the refectory, the \u00bbit y was clear.\nThe refreshments were plentiful but\nmight have been more delicate.\nThe bar stayed open until 3.0\naided by a smart white oo a ted waiter\nwho skilfully collected all empty\nglasses. Mr. Andy Matthews also\nlent an air of refinement in his\nsmooth announcement of the da noes, overcoming a faulty microphone.\nDuring tie evening Mr. Butters proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. E.

The\nteam was not at full strength, and the\nless said about this match, the better.\nThe one good performance by an I.C. man was in the 440 yd s, in w hio hF. Goodwin was very narrowly defeated\nin a time of 52.7 s. An I.C. team spent a day and a night\nat Exeter for a fixture with St.Luke'a. The match was not a oom ple te walk-ever\nfor St. Luke's, as might have been\nimagined from the BBC West Region\ncommentary; in fact the I.C. so ore was more than half their opponents'\nso ore. However, St.Luke's have some\nvery promising athletes, aad won most\nof the events. The most exciting\nrace of the afternoon was the 440,\nwon by K. Ludlam in 52.3 s. with\nP. Goodwin 3rd.

Alas, this was not to\nbe, as a monumental collapse saw I.C. back in the bar for 106.\nSt. Mark's and St. John's were\nput out for a tedious 114, and a sparkling opening stand of 72 between\nBullook (37) and Deal (66 n.o.) soon\nput paid to them.\nTheae two failed in a high-scoring\ngame against Old Sinjuns and it was\nleft to rather more venerable gentlemen\nto bring about a recover. Kapur (66)\nand Kitohener (78) added 145 in 100\nminutes enabling I.C. to declare at\n179-5. Unfortunately the I.C. bowlers\noo ul d get nothing from the wicket and\nOld Sinjuns won by seven wickets. A pleasing feature of I.C.'s play was\nthe running between wickets, described\nby the O.S.o apt a in as the best he had\nseen for years.

W.S.C. is perhaps the most\nversatile sports club in the College,\nHaving pursued hockey balls, squash\nballs, table tennis balls, netball a and badminton feathers during the\nwinter terms, the club is now\npursuing tennis balls,cricket balls,\nand a somewhat checkered course in\nathletics.\nIn the competition for the Sherwood\nFaster Cup I,C. came 3rd. being beaten\nby the School of Slavonic and East\nEuropean studies and by Wye College.\nIn the straight Championships, ICWSC\ncams 5th. out of 12 teams. This is\nno mean feat, when one remembers that\nICWSC is one of the smallest women's \u2022ports clubs in the University, and\nthat none of its members profess to\nbe highly skilled athletes.\nOur achievements are largely due to\nMaureen Baser, who finished 2nd. in\nthe 440 yd s. and 880 yd s. and was a finalist in the Discus.\nNo doubt several people have been\nintrigued by the small typewritten\nnotices announcing acr ioke t match,\nwh i oh have appeared in the Union.\nThis great cricket match is to be\nplayed between ICWSC and the Crioket\nClub next Thursday evening at Harlingten, and supporters are Invited\nto attend. Naturally the men have\nagreed to a slight handicap to ensure\nthat the match will be evenly fought.\nIt should also be mentioned that\nthe percentage of women who attended\nSports Day was far greater than the\npercentage of men present.\nMlspquote: \"Never has so much been\nex pee ted by so many of so few\".\nBOAT CLUB VICTORY The 1st.
