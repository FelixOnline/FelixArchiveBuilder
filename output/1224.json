    "content": "reviews film 23\nBlackhawk Down\nreleased 18th January\n17:37, 3rd October, 1993: American UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters\ndrop 120 elite soldiers into downtown Mogadishu to kidnap\nSomalian warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid's top advisors and\nmilitary officials. The operation is scheduled for an hour.\n09:11, 4th October, 1993: 18 Americans are dead and 73 wounded in the biggest single firefight involving American troops since\nthe Vietnam war. Somalian officials claim that one thousand\nmilitia have been killed; independent observers place the estimate somewhere around five-hundred.\nIn 1993, Somalia was suffering from terrible famine, hundreds\nof thousands had already died and millions were facing star va tion. The country's most powerful warlord, Mohammed Farrah\nAided, was quelling food distribution in an attempt to win Somalia's long and bloody civil war. Faced with a humanitarian\ndisaster on a biblical scale, the United Nations intervened, with\nfood airlifts and peacekeeping forces.\nIn the meantime, the U.S. military set up operation Task Force\nRanger, to root out and remove Aided and his staff. The operation culminated with intelligence pointing to a building in central Mogadishu, where Aided's top lieutenants were hiding. A highly trained team was assembled to kidnap them. If everything went according to plan then the mission would take one\nhour and there would be no American casualties.\nBlackhawk Down tells the story of the kidnapping and the\nsubsequent Battle of Mogadishu in graphic detail. Rarely before\nhas the American public been exposed to the bare physical reality of warfare. Ridley Scott's movie should put off any prospective army recruit. I mean, who wants to have their legs blown\noff by a rocket propelled grenade? Not me. I would prefer to get\nlegless down Southside.\nDespite the breath-taking ly realistic action sequences the\nmovie's centre piece is a message about friendship, heroism,\nand the true nature of war. But this is really a case of Hollywood\nrewriting history. The truth is that the operation was characterised by incompetence on behalf of the American leadership,\na complete failure of intelligence, and infighting.\nFelix On Film Competition\nWhen a routine drug deal is not what it seems. Clayton Pierce,\nanti-terror ti st agent, working undercover, finds out that the\ndeal is actually a nuclear bomb. In a world where the truth has\na price. And the price is the truth. Timelapse is a straight-to-video B movie which you have a chance to win. Just answer\nthis simple question:\nWho directed this year's The Lord Of The Rings:\nThe Fellowship Of The Chicken Wing?\na) Peter Jackson\nb) Barrie Osborne\nc) Colonel Sanders\nAnswers to: film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFrancis Ford Coppola once said that the artistic obligation of\nany director making a war movie is to make an anti-war movie.\nRidley Scott's Blackhawk Down is not anti-war. It is an attempt\nto hide historical events such as this behind a wall of clich ed sentimentality, in a patent refusal to serve up the real truth\nabout the sheer idiocy of American involvement in Somalia. It\nalso champions the ignorance of the individual soldiers as they\nsacrifice their lives unquestioningly for a cause that proved to\nbe so trifling for US policymakers that President Clinton called\noff the whole of operation Task Force Ranger the next day.\nIn the light of recent events in Afghanistan this movie will\nprovide real insight into the methods employed the US in their\ncovert operations abroad. The importance of intelligence gathering. This is modern American warfare. No longer the interminable struggle between the huge armies of two nations.\nInstead you have short and isolated encounters between highly trained and equipped American forces and third-world militia\narmed with rocks and Soviet machine-guns.\nThe sheer mismatch between US soldiers and Somalian militia makes painful viewing at times. And as so often in Ridley\nScott movies, the plot and characters take a back seat and you\nare left with a series of dazzling and often disturbing images\nand impressions of a terrible battle.\nThe acting is completely forgettable and Ridley Scott is the\nonly star of the show. The characters are all faceless clich es. There's the idealist who cries, the pragmatist who smokes, kills,\nand lives life on the edge, and the guy who always has a picture\nof his wife and child handy just when he's going to die. \"Tell\nher...ugh... that I lo... lov... loathe cheesy deaths,\" I clearly\nremember him saying, before realising that he's missing a torso.\nThe dialogue is always corny to the point of hilarity.\nProducer, Jerry Bruckheimer's presence is felt only too well.\nThere is a clear parallel here with Pearl Harbour and\nArmageddon in terms of the moral ising and hero-worship. But\nwhat partly redeems the movie is the action, at times on a par\nwith the opening twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan, with\nthe only criticism being that there is too much of it. The action\nbecomes diluted, especially with clich ed characters. Because\nwho cares when ac liche dies? It's already dead.\nSo overall, it may look and sound spectacular, but Blackhawk\nDown is boring.\nDarius\n\n"

This year's nominated charity\nis the Shooting Star Trust, a charity set up in\n1995 to help children in our area who are not\nexpected to live beyond early adulthood.\nThey're currently trying to pull together the\nfunding to build and kit out the first specialist children's hospice serving West\nLondon. Rather than focusing on one particular disease or illness, they want to provide\nhelp to local children with all sorts of life-threatening conditions - everything from\ncancer to muscular dystrophy to cystic\nfibrosis to cerebral palsy. The new hospice\nwill give them somewhere to live safely and\ncomfortably, away from the sterile, depressing environment of hospital. Obviously, this\nkind of care is particularly important to chi l IC Radio goes drinking!\nFor those that missed the fun and frolics\nyesterday, IC Radio had a huge relaunch\nparty, involving drinking, silliness and all\nthose things we're good at. It was a chance to meet some of the ex-members\nfrom yesteryear and find out what things\nwere like in days of old. Or at least, that's how I imagine it will have been, but due to\nprint deadlines, I'm actually writing this\nMonday night and none of it's occurred\nyet. But be assured we'll let you know the\nfull story next week, when we'll have a special full page feature all about IC\nRadio, some of the history, and photos of\nthe new studios, and the carnage at the\nrelaunch party. So if you were there, be\nafraid, you may have been caught...\nHappy Birthday\nA little known fact, but IC Radio reached\nthe grand old age of 27 this Monday\n(14th). Back then we were operating off a reel to reel tape deck and a microphone, in\na room in Linstead, so we've moved on\nRag Ramble\nd ren who have no chance of recovery and\nno medical treatment left to try, but it's also\nincredibly valuable to their parents, who\nwould otherwise be left to tend for them\nand the rest of the family alone.\nSo for the charity have bought a site in\nHounslow, and are bringing together the\nlast of the funding to put up some walls\n(and perhaps the odd ceiling) this summer.\nHowever, they still need more money to kit\nout the hospice - and that's where we come\nin. They need everything from beds to\nkitchens to PCs with special controls, and\nwe're looking to provide enough funding to\nmake real progress. Indeed one of the best\nthings about working with the Shooting\nStar Appeal is that our efforts can make a really big difference - potentially helping to\nmake the project a reality by the end of the\nyear. So, in true Blue Peter style e, we've\nmade up a wish-list of the kind of things\nthat we want to buy...\n\u2022 For \u00a31000, we can provide a fully-equipped music room.\nIC Radio\nquite well, and from such humble begin-ning s, we've grown to be London's premier student station.\nLearn to mix\nThat's right, the famous IC Radio mix masterclass is back.

For the uninitiated, the basic\npremise is that some of our DJs give some\ntips and tricks for those who'd like to be\nthe next Judge Jules, and then give one-on-one tuition to people in turn. It's a great way to get started if you've always\nwanted to have a go, but have never had\nthe opportunity to, so watch this space for\nmore details.\nThe Breakfast show\nAs some of you may know, this academic\nyear we've started producing breakfast\nshows every weekday morning from 8 till\n10am.

    "content": "college news\nUnion Shake-Up?\nAll the discussion over the past\nfew months on the subject of\nthe new Union structure came\nto a head last Tuesday.\nThere had been hopes that\nthe shakedown of the structure\nwould clear away some dead\nwood from the system, but it\nseems that the force of conservatism has won, with very few\nchanges being made that will\naffect the average student.\nTo understand the changes\nmade requires a strong understanding of Union policy, however the reasons for the change\nare much easier to explain.\nSince the rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, announced the new move to a faculty system that\nCollege is undertaking at the\nmoment, it has been obvious\nthat the Union must change in\nsome way so as to reflect this,\nin order to have any chance of\nrepresenting the students within the various departments. The\npast few months have seen\nmany theories put forward, but\nthe final options were laid out\nby Union President Sen Ganesh\non Tuesday, during a five hour\nCouncil meeting that was almost entirely on this subject.\nSince these changes will\nmodify the Union constitution, a two thirds majority is required\nover two separate sessions to\naffect the changes, and each\nsession is meant to have a 'quo-rate' number of Union officers\npresent. The majority was easily reached, with David Francis\n(Deputy President of Education\nand Welfare), the only person\nwho voted against the new changes being made. However,\nwhile there were more than the\nquo rate amount of votes cast,\nthis was due to many votes\nbeing pro xie d from non-present\nmembers, and therefore if\nsomeone had cared to say 'quo-rum', the meeting would have\nto have been declared invalid.\nThis practice, however, is usually considered a waste of time,\ndue to the low turnout that\nCouncil generally has. It is\ninteresting, therefore, to note\nthat the new changes will add\naround an extra 40 members to\nCouncil, most of whom will be\nDepartmental representatives.\nHowever, since the Union is a part of College, all changes will\nhave to go through the\nCollege's own governing bod-ies, and it has been noted that\nmany of the members of these\nbodies will not like the idea of\nan eighty strong Union Council,\nseeing as the College Council\nonly has 20 members. If the\nchanges that are being made\nby this 'sovereign' student\nbody, therefore, are not liked by\nCollege, they can return the\nsuggested amendments to the\nUnion, stating any of their own\nchanges that they feel should\nbe considered. While they can\nnot actually state what should\nbe in the Union Constitution,\nthey can make very strong suggestions, and in the mean time\nmake life quite uncomfortable\nfor the Union, both financially\nand politically. While this\nreporter is certainly not suggesting that these tactics\nwould be undertaken, it is\nnotable that if this were to\noccur then any external\nobservers may see this as an\ninfringement of student rights,\nand public knowledge of anything along these lines occurring could be heavily detrimental to both the image of\nImperial College as a whole, as\nwell as the view of the Union\nthat other political student\nbodies may have. However, if\nCollege feels the changes the\nUnion wants to make are fool-ish, they will have no choice\nbut to step in, so it is a narrow\npath that must be trodden.\nOn a less global level, how-4-Issue122418 th January 2002\nEditor: will Dugdale\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews: Vacant\nMusic: Dave Edwards\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nSports: Vacant\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nWith Thanks To:\nJoe, Helen, J, Bobby C Felix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2001\never, the important changes\nthat have passed this first draft\nof a new Constitution are mainly in name.

    "content": "reviews book\nThe Third Policeman\nFlann O 'Brien, \u00a34.99\nThe Third Policeman is a truly unique novel with obvious Irish\norigins, a tale set in a reality where the basic rules of our world\nno longer apply. It surrounds an individual who is forced from\none strange situation to another, the fact that you will never\nknow the name of the main character is an indication of the\nstyle of this novel.\nHe is brought up in circumstances that are a little strange. An only child whose parents both die when he is very young, he is\nsent to an expensive boarding school. Meantime somebody else\nis left to look after the family farm, namely John Divney. At\nboarding school he starts to develop an interest in de Selby, an\neccentric physicist/ philosopher from the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. By the time he leaves boarding school and returns to\nthe farm he intends to devote his time to cataloguing all of de\nSelby's works and the work of all his commentators. However,\nonce this is complete he needs money to publish it. The farm is\nnot doing well, however. At John Divney's suggestion the decision is eventually made to murder old Mathers who keeps his\nmoney in a black metal cash box. John Divney hides the box\nuntil it is 'safe' to use the money but does not reveal the hiding\nplace for three years, during which time a rather strained relationship builds up between them. Once the hiding place is\nrevealed our protagonist goes to collect it. What follows is a tale\nof his attempts to get hold of this box.\nThis tale moves from strange to, bizarre to completely\nobscene, an army of three legged men and bicycles with personalities are just two examples from the world created by\nO 'Brien. The aura of surreal abnormality within this novel makes\nit a wonderful book to escape into and I warn you, you will probably want to read it twice. What starts out as a murder becomes\na black comedy, eventually reaching a dark conclusion, do not\nbe fooled by the appearance that this is a comedy of c irc um stance, there is a very grave moral underlying.\nThe Third Policeman by Flann O 'Brien is published by\nFlamingo priced at \u00a34.99.\nPest Control\nBill Fitzhugh, \u00a35.99\nOne of the most humorous books published in 2000 was Dave\nBarry's Big Trouble and was reviewed in Felix in the autumn of\nthat year. Although nothing this year came close to the hilarity\nof this story I did happen to read over Christmas a very amusing and well-written debut novel by Bill Fitzhugh called Pest\nControl. Bob Dillon (you can see where some of the jokes comes\nfrom straight away) is an unhappy exterminator in New York\nCity. Bob is trying to find a better way of dealing with the city's dirtiest and most unwelcome creatures. You see, Bob is an environmentally friendly bug exterminator and decides to quit his\njob in the hope that he can breed \"super\" bugs that will kill your\ncommon household pests without the need for pesticides and\npoisonous sprays.\nBob places his advertisement for his new extermination service in the local papers and the ad falls into the hands of a middle man for a world-wide assassination service who believes\nthat Bob and his title of \"The Assassin\" is a veiled reference to\nhis status as a hit-man. Getting an idea of the trouble in store,\nBob begs off the lucrative job he's offered. But when the victim\nis accidentally killed anyway, the middleman, assuming Bob's managed the job with unusual finesse, duly sends him his fee.\nEvery thing sounds status quo until the UPS package with the\nmoney gets held on the way to Bob; his wife and daughter,\nimpatient with his approach to pest control, walk out on him;\nand the brother and murderer of a Bolivian drug-lord who wants\nto cover up his own crime informs the world that it was the\nwork of the Exterminator and offers a$10 million bounty to whoever kills Bob, attracting all the top exterminators in the field.\nPest Control is a very well written and humourous novel. The\ncharacters stand out as very real people and Bob is the your typical \"man in wrong place at the wrong time.\" The two main\nstars of this novel without a doubt are Bob's young daughter\nand the bugs themselves who finally come to Bob's assistance\ntowards the end of this very light but highly entertaining read.\nPest Control is the first of four books by Bill Fitzhugh and is\npublished by Arrow, priced \u00a35.99.\nJennifer Jonathan\n\n"

    "content": "arts reviews\nThe Thief of Tears\nEtcetera Theatre, Camden\nThe Oxford Arms Pub on Camden High Street is an ideal place\nto get some shelter on a winter day after wandering through the\nCamden Market all the afternoon. The pub looks old and worn\nout, but what's special with the place is that upstairs it hides a cosy connoisseurs' venue: the Etcetera Theatre.\nThe current production is Jeffrey Hatcher's \"The Thief of\nTears\", a monologue from the trilogy \"Three Viewings\", awarded\nin 1993 with the Rosenthal New Play Prize. Natalie Bromley\ngraduated last summer in English at Cambridge, and she has\nalready shown her skills as an actress at the Edinburgh Festival.\nHer first appearance on the London theatre scenery sees her in\nthe challenging double role of producer and actress.\nThe show lasts for half an hour and the stage is as static as a stage can be: the only object on it is a bench that at some point\nthe character turns into a coffin, but through her convincing acting only. The thief of tears is a young American woman, of\ngranny's funeral. She's a thief of tears because she hangs around\nthe funerals of unknown wealthy people and as she kneels down\non the coffin to moan she tries and steals jewelry from the dead\nbody. She's content with her way of living until she tries to steal\nthe ring that she has dreamt about during her childhood that her\npast starts to pour out through the leaks of her conscience.\nThe dynamism of this play is terrific, you can say anything,\nexcept that it is boring. The mood switches so many times\nbetween comic, dramatic, and tragic tones. The skilled light-work transforms the scenery accordingly but is on Natalie the\nmost of the burden. Hatcher has managed to write a monologue\nfit to challenge the actress and to strip bare her skills and short-ages, but I must say that Natalie comes out very well from this\ntrial, showing a confidence worth that of an experienced actor\nand proving herself able to act in both dramatic genders.\nConcluding, the theatre is a bit far away and a trip to Camden\nfor a very short play could seem wasted but if you happen to be\nin the right place at the right time, then it's value for money at\n\u00a35-9. For those with thespian ambitions instead it is a must:\ntake it as a technical challenge. Could you do that?\nA Hf* \u2022 \u2022\nRent\nPrince of Wales Theatre\nThe nation was consoled at Adam Rickett's departure from\nCoronation Street only by the steamy launch of his scantily clad\npop career. So imagine the delight of his latest project, promising\na bubbly fusion both his soap acting talent with his boyband-esque dulcet tones. After torturing the rest of the country for the\npast months, Rent is now back in London for a disappointing 8\nweeks only (disappointing in its longevity, not brevity).\nOminous from the start, the show begins with Rickett setting\nthe scene. Playing Mark, as an amateur arty-film-type, he\nannoys most of the characters as he introduces them, poking his\ncine-camera in peoples' faces. This introduction, and most of\nAdam's performance is startlingly confusing. His Peewee\nHerman-is ed American accent stutters and vomits its way\nthrough the show, tearing into his songs. The set, around which\nthe characters bounce, is faultless. Graffiti scarred brick work, misted in steam as it drifts from sewers provides a convincing\nbackdrop of a rundown New York side street. The said street\ngives rise to the characters squat in which most of the characters live (legally thanks to the generosity of Benny, an evil-type).\nThe basic plot (and it is basic) follows Adam and his band of\nsquatters as they are faced with eviction from the squat. But\nthere's a twist <gasp>. Benny's ultimatum is for the squatters\nto help him stop a \"homelessness demonstration\" or face evi c tion. Confusing HIV/AIDS subplot emerges which seems to\naffect all the characters, but which un surprisingly the publicity\nmaterial makes no reference to.\nThe emotional tumult of friendships, romances, arguments\nand deaths should engage you, even at a musical, but so\nplucked from thin air, and so quickly do they surface and di sap pear, that it's hard to feel anything but pity for people as they\nwrithe around the stage in pretend agony.\nThere have to be more entertaining ways of spending three\nhours (and \u00a315), than seeing Rent. The pure energy from the\ncast, and sterling singing performances from several, are not\nenough to de mystify poor acting, unemotional situations, and a flat, confusing plot. Did they lose it or did I? Sergio Wayne\n\n"

As ever Dekefex had put\ntogether a night that took in guest artists\nsuch as the established - but not establishment - alt hip-hop DJ Vadim, and\nbanging sounds of Bad Company.\nAlways one to promote upcoming artists,\nless well-known but soon to be heard in\ngood clubs everywhere, collectives such\nas Moorish Delta 7 were a welcome\ninclusion in the night.\nThe residents, DJ Skeletnx and D JNU, laid down a scratchy style e mix of old\nskool, new skool, and any skool. I have\nnot heard such a flow of poetry for a while. And, mercifully, emcees seem to\nbe getting a lot more intelligent (or the\ntrue ones always were) than in the dubious days of the birth of jungle and 'intel-li gent' Dn'B. One favorite lyric (on a free\nsampler CD given away on the night)\nwas 'I 'll strap a Nokia to your head and\nring you till your brain fries'. Nice.\nThe main emceeing acts of the night\nwere Moorish Delta 7 and Phi Life Cipher.\nBoth of these gave amazing perform anc es. Beats ranging from funky to dark rap\ncuts to pure and simple hip hop gave the\nbackdrop to tales of urban strife and\neveryday life.\nThen it was down to some serious beats\nthat demanded serious dancing from DJ Vadim (with Demolition Man), and the\noccasional b boy breakdancing making\nus all feel temporarily inadequate.\nAnyone who has heard DJ Vadim does\nnot need me to explain the maestro's fusion of beats, breaks, and found\nsounds. Never heard of DJ Vadim? Why\nnot? Get yo' ass on the dance floor boy!\nMoorish Delta 7:\nInterview\nMoorish Delta 7 are a three-piece hip-hop\noutfit from Birmingham. The trio - Cipher\nJEWELS, 'The Captain'; Malik, 'The Street\nPoet'; and, Jawar, 'The Bull' - grew up\ntogether on grimy council estates. In\naddition to putting out their own tunes,\nthey also have an agenda to promote\nlocal underground artists. The latter\nincludes their 7 Entertainment project\nand the compilation 'Experiment T.I had\na chat with them at Mass, ...\nJawar, I read an interview where you\ndescribed Cipher as 'serious' yet 'chilled,\nand said that there was a kind of\n'yin/yang' thing about his character. Also,\nyou're the 'Life of the Party' but also the\n'live wire'... There's a lot of duality here?\nMalik: Exactly.\nCipher: You get that in the songs any-way, you can feel it in the expression.\nTake Art of Survival' that's there in the\nfeeling, it's experience. But again, some\nof our sounds are more simple love of hip-hop.\nJawar: It's the voice of the people ...\nThat's something I wanted to ask you.\nYou grew up on council estates in\nBirmingham... On your website you talk\nabout 'Silent Screams' being the voice, but\nwhose voice? Is it yours? The people you\ngrew up with? Yours and their collective\nexperience?\nJawar: It's the voice of the people. We\nhave no-one to answer to but the people\non the streets. We don't need to answer\nto the record companies saying 'play like\nthis' or the media. The people on the\nstreets is the only people we have to\nanswer to.\nMalik: How we represent, it's our genera-tion. All of our past experiences are in it.\nLike you said before, your music falls into\ntwo broad categories: the urban tales,\nand the hip-hop for the sake of hip-hop.\nfd like to ask about the former. You\ndescribe Art of Survival' as a futuristic\nurban song. In what way do you mean\nfuturistic? Is it prophetic? Apocalyptic?\nA vision? An inevitability? Or is it a warn-ing?\nMalik: Every day people are getting hungrier and hungrier. It's just the way it is.\nIt's the feeling on the streets and in the\ncities.\nJawar: It's at the level of the streets,\nthose are the sounds in every tune.\nMalik: It's not a prediction, it's just that\nthat's how the vibes is going right now.\nOne final question: what's your favourite\nsound, each of you? I don't mean like a genre like 'soul' or whatever I mean a single sound like this [snaps fingers] or this\n[drums on wall].\nCipher: A drum.\nMore specific?\nCipher: Oh, I like all drums. A snare\ndrum.\nMalik: Piano.\nJawar: A woman.\nCipher: You know, there's a duality. We\nargue, of course we argue, but we will\nalways back each other up. This is three\nin one. It's more than music. This is what\nkeeps us going, it's what we depend on.\nWe give each other counsel and support.\nEven if it's not music, whatever it is.\nThat's why it doesn't sound manufactured. If any one of us left, it wouldn't be\nMoorish Delta 7. MD7 is the three.\nMalik: We've had so many tunes over the\nyears. And certain vibes happen. We\ndon't look to the next man.\nCipher: We do something different if it\nfeels right. That's why it's genuine.\nRobert Robert\n\n"

    "content": "lifestyle feature\nAll offers of employment\nHOLLY BARNES\nIf there's one thing that I 've learned this\nyear, it's that being unemployed isn't all\nit's cracked up to be. Believe me, few\nthings in this life are more depressing\nthan the queue to sign on of a Wednesday\nmorning - except perhaps the realisation\nthat it's the most exciting part of the\nweek. At university there's always something you could be doing and, more than\nlikely something you should be doing -but there's simply bugger all to do if\nyou're unemployed. And, of course,\nthere's the fact that it's pretty hard to live\non \u00a342 per week. Basically, it may be a learning and growing experience, but it's certainly a lifestyle that I strongly recommend you avoid at all costs.\nBut I'm sure you know all that already -after all, it's fairly unlikely that any of you\nare genuinely considering unemployment\nas a lifestyle choice. The real question is,\nwhat's the solution? How do you avoid the\ndole queue and the exciting world of the\nJob Seekers Allowance? Well, a good\ndegree, a wealth of knowledge, bucket-loads of experience and a real desire to do\nwhatever it is you want to do would certainly be a good starting point. And charm, good looks and a nice shiny suit\ncan't hurt, either. But the real sticking\npoint isn't what you know, or even who\nyou know - it's how you talk about it.\nAccording to the latest research by the\nAssociation of Graduate Recruiters, 43% of\nleading graduate recruiters \"reported skill\nshortages in three of the attributes ranked\nmost important by employers - interpersonal skills, initiative/pro activity and oral\ncommunication\" (and before you get carried away thinking that the other key\nskills they were looking for were technical\nor scientific, you may as well know that\nthey were \"for graduates to be good team\nplayers, motivated and enthusiastic, flexible and adaptable\"). These findings are\nbacked up by the results of an Industry In\nEducation study of the nation's largest\nemployers, which concludes that employers are \"looking at personal skills more\nthan degree content\" when it comes to\nhiring recent graduates.\nSo what do we conclude from all this?\nWell, firstly, my Careers Advisor wasn't lying when she started witte ring on about\nthe importance of 'Personal Transferable\nSkills'. Secondly, that a good degree does\nnot automatically entitle you to a good job.\nAnd thirdly that it might, perhaps, be a good idea to get some practice at this\ncommunication, team working and leadership malarkey. And how do I do that, you\nask? (OK, so you don't, but play along\nhere). By getting involved in clubs and\nsocieties, charity work or local volunteer\nprojects, I reply. Well, actually, I don't the\nemployers do. You see, yet another report\n(this time by TimeBank) indicates that\nthree-quarters of the UK's top employers\ngive preference to candidates with volunteering experience on their CV, whilst over\nhalf of the companies surveyed said that\n\"voluntary work experience can actually\nbe more valuable than experience gained\nin paid employment\". And, whilst most of\nthe figures I'm quoting here refer to 'traditional' graduate recruitment fields (bank-ing, consultancy, engineering, manage-ment, IT etc), remember that they apply\njust as strongly (if not far more so) to less\ntechnical fields like media, law, the arts\nand teaching. Oh, and apparently they're\npretty important for doctors too...\nSo, anyway, volunteering. It's a deceptively simple concept, which actually\nencompasses a massive range of possibilities - and almost certainly includes some\nof the work that you're already doing. At\none extreme, it could mean making a huge\ncommitment to changing the world, saving lives or raising tens of thousands of\npounds for charity - but on the other hand\nit can mean much simpler things like getting involved in running your favourite\nsociety, working in your local school for a couple of hours a week, or just helping out\nwith the next Rag event. And, if you do\nwant to do something \"worthy\" (a tired\nand clich ed phrase I 'll admit, but you get\nthe idea), there are lots of opportunities for\nyou to get involved on campus, with the\nPimlico Connection (teaching in local\nschools - head to www.su.ic.ac.uk/pim li co to find out how to get involved) and the\nCommunity Action Group (who deliver\nfood to the homeless, help out at local\nhomes for the elderly and repair tools for\nCentral African farmers - check out\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/ca g to find out more) the\ntwo most obvious examples.\nAside from these clear cut examples,\nhowever, volunteering also includes all\nsorts of other activities. Responsible for\nrunning publicity or arranging fixtures for\nyour society? Year Rep in your depart-ment? Help out with collections, work in\nthe Union or get involved with organising\nevents? That all counts. And so does caring for elderly relatives, looking after small\nrelatives or your friends' children, and a million more things besides. To be honest,\nit's almost certain that you're already\ndoing (or have done) some kind of voluntary work (and, indeed, part of the point of\nthis article is just to make you realise its\nvalue) but it's also fairly unlikely that any\none activity could possibly have taught\nyou every one of those key skills.\nFortunately, though, there are lots of\nopportunities available on campus - head\nover to the Union to find out more, get in\ncontact with a new society or just think\nabout getting more involved in what\nyou're doing already.\nHopefully, however, you'll know all that\nalready, too. Two schemes that you might\nnot know about, however, are Millennium\nVolunteers and Insight Plus. The first is a major government initiative to increase\nthe number of young people volunteering\nin their local community. Anyone aged\nbetween 16 and 24 can register online (at\nwww. millennium volunteers. gov. uk) to\n\"use what you're in to to help yourself and\nothers\", and whilst the scheme does\ninclude plenty of opportunities to work at\nyour local shelter or home, there's also the\npotential to get involved in anything from\nsports coaching to the environment to\nyouth groups to music to journalism.\nMoreover, the scheme is backed by a host\nof big employers, there's support and\nmentoring every step of the way, and\nyou'll receive a recognised award after\ncontributing 100 hours.\nInsight Plus (www.insight plus. co.uk)\napproaches the problem from a slightly\ndifferent direction. Like I said before, lots\nof us already do a lot of voluntary work, so\ninstead of encouraging you to get involved\nwith new projects, it's designed to help\nyou to make the most of your current com-mit ment s. Basically, you look at what\nyou're doing (be it voluntary work,\ninvolvement in a society, a part-time job or\nfamily commitments) and analyse what\nskills you've gained as a result - thus turn-feature lifestyle\ngratefully received...\ning you into a much hotter prospect at\ninterview. The scheme also includes a series of tutorials and workshops, plus the\npromise of official accreditation on completion of the course. Sadly, however,\nInsight Plus is currently only available to\nstudents at participating universities,\nwhich (at present) doesn't include\nImperial. Sorry.\nAnyway, if all this isn't enough for you,\nthe final option is to head to your local\nVolunteer Bureau - for example, the\nKensington & Chelsea Volunteer Bureau\n(check out www.voluntary work. org.uk);\nthe Hammersmith & Fulham Volunteer\nDevelopment Agency (www.hf vd a. co.uk)\nor Wandsworth Council Volunteer Bureau\n(check out www.wv b. co.uk) - who should\nhave lots of information on local schemes\nand volunteering in general. For a complete list of centres, check out the National\nVolunteer Bureau's central website (at\nwww.nav b. org.uk), where you'll find\ndetails of pretty much every voluntary\ngroup in the country - so wherever you\nlive in London, there should be a support\ngroup for you.\nThe only negative thing to say about\nthese initiatives is to contrast what\nImperial's doing with the investment and\ninvolvement with that made by other universities and student unions. The current\nInsight Plus roll-out is unlikely to include\nImperial (although that may have something to do with the fact that the NUS was\na founding partner in the scheme), whilst\nthe Union has not chosen to get involved\nin Millennium Volunteers (unlike several\nother student unions - such as Leicester,\nBirmingham and Brunei - who both back\nthe scheme and provide their own volunteering opportunities). Fortunately, the situation is likely to improve in the near\nfuture, as the College, the government\nand the funding councils all seem to have\nrecognised the importance of volunteering\nand student development in the modern\njob market, and are thus making a major\ninvestment (including dedicated staff) in\nthis field over the next few years. In the\nmeantime, however, there are still plenty\nof opportunities all around you (we are in\nthe centre of London, after all), so stop\nmaking excuses, get off your backside and\ndo something with your life.\nSo, yeah, that's about it. Volunteering is\ngood, basically Good for lots of reasons -and, quite frankly, I'd like to think that\nenhancing your employ ability is the least\nof them. It's( mostly) fun. It's a diversion\nfrom lectures, lab and revision. It makes\nyou feel better about yourself. And, by and\nlarge, it makes the world a better place.\nBut you know all that - it's just that, faced\nwith a hundred other things that you\nshould be doing, \"doing some good\"\ntends to fall to the bottom of the pile.\nWhich is perfectly understandable. But\nhopefully, all you need is that one extra\nreason that'll get you to make that first\nstep towards getting involved - and I honestly hope that the prospect of joining me\nin the queue at the Job Centre every other\nWednesday is it.\nHolly Barnes is currently unemployed.\nAll offers of employment, freelance work,\na regular income, unbridled gratitude,\nfree love or one way tickets to Acapulco\nshould be addressed to not@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "INTERVIEW with King Adora\nreviews music\nLIVE: King Adora\n@ Electric Ballroom\nTeenage drama queens in feather boas and glittery fairy wings\ncrammed inside the Electric Ballroom (home of the highly recommended Full Tilt night) to see the much-revered all-singing,\nall-dancing King Adora. The impression I got was not of a band\nwho were some kind of \"glam revivalists\" just because they\nwear eyeliner and sing impolitely about sex, but of a pretty\nwicked pop band.\nThe sparkly butterflies were in for a shock when their pop\nidols inflicted us with not one but two relatively mediocre support bands. One could have been led to think that the Candies\nand their fellow minion posse were strategically positioned to\nmake even a lacklustre King Adora seem excellent in comp ari sion, but was this the case? Definitely not, for King Adora blew\nthe Ballroom apart. This was one of Maxi Browne's \"glory gigs\"!\nFrom the moment they took to the stage with a rousing rendition of live favourite Bionic, moshi ng was taken to stratospheric levels, with people flung to the far corners of the room by the\nbrute force with which we were musically moved. With the\ncrowd whipped into a frenzy, the band experimented with some\nmaterial from their forthcoming album, the Suede-esque Tokyo\nHoney. Even Maxi's facial expressions and poses would have\ndone Brett Anderson proud, for imitation is the finest form of\nflattery. This track, which wasn't extremely stunning for such a talented bunch, was greeted with so much favour that it\nseemed like the crowd would have lapped up a performance of\nthe Yellow Pages.\nHighlights included the excellent Law, the intense Smoulder,\nthe distinctive Suffocate and the Pixies-influenced Big Isn't Beautiful. Suffice to say, these were the singles, and the pure\nenergy put into them by both the band and the mosher s made\nthem memorable. However, the \"album-fillers\" weren't done\njustice live as the band simply churned them out one by one.\nThe set being short but sweet, I conclude that King Adora\nhave the talent for writing instantly likable and infinitely mosh-able songs, all of which sound just different enough from the\nothers to be interesting.\nBefore their recent gig at the Electric Ballroom (see review, left),\nFelix spoke to Maxi and Nelsta from King Adora.\nFELIX: Can you please tell us what King Adora are all about?\nMAXI: Our band is about decadence, rock and roll, having fun,\ndecent tunes, live music, debauchery and glamour. Things a lot\nof bands out there don't have.\nSo how would you describe your music to the untrained ear?\nMAXI: Sleaze-rock!\nHow did you guys get together then, and why\" King Adora'\"?\nMAXI: I was making music when I saw Nelsta performing with\nanother band, and I thought \"right, I'm poaching him for my\nband\". Nelsta knew the other two, and so we started jamming\ntogether. As for the band name, we were out shopping one day\nand we saw this huge six-foot vibrator in a shop window. It's name was King Adora, advertised for \"maximum, heightened\nsensation\". And that's what we're all about.\nWhat's your favourite part of being in a band?\nMAXI: There's lots of things I like doing. Touring, both playing\nlive and having fun on the tour bus.\nExplain \"fun\" to me. I hear your band is notorious with the\ngroupies...?\nMAXI: Groupies?! Lets just say we're young and we like to\nenjoy ourselves. We have a laugh on the bus, you know, playing\na show, partying, getting wrecked. It's quite like the stereotyped notion of the tour bus, in films and all.\nI understand that you took part in various prestigious tours.\nWhich was your favourite and why?\nMAXI: My favourite was the Mansun tour. We're quite similar to\nthem, as we dress up and like to have a good time. The crowd\nfound us easy to relate to; we were poaching their fans.\nNELSTA: We learnt a lot from them as people, about the business and touring - they've gone so far and done so well.\nWhat was the high point of being in King Adora for you?\nMAXI: Touring in Japan. We learnt lots about the culture in the\nsix days we were over there.\nYou have a new album coming out soon...\nMAXI: Yes, we're going in to record it next week.\nNELSTA: We've just finished doing a demo actually.\nIs it a massive change of direction for you? How is it different\nto Vibrate You, the last album?\nMAXI: It's a lot darker and heavier, less feel-good. We're technically more tight on it; it's the album we've always wanted to\nmake but never had time. The last one was done in such a rush.\nNELSTA: We've used different producers on it too.\nIf a fan asked you for your socks, what would you do?\nMAXI: I'd give them away.\nCan I have your socks then?\nMAXI: Yeah, sure.\nIf the fans could give you a Christmas gift, what would it be?\nMAXI: Just to keep supporting us and coming out to our gigs.\nNELSTA: Fags, booze, socks... but what I'd really like is a Hohner Professional L90 Goldtop guitar! So if anybody's got the\nmoney, please give me one!\nSajini Sajini\n\n"

    "content": "Station 17\nHitparade\nOut now on Mute records\nThere is a fantastic, bizarre story behind\nthis album. Station 17 originated in a Hamburg mental institute in 1988. Social\nworker Kay Bosen thought that a number\nof his patients could benefit from being\nallowed to express themselves musically,\nhowever they liked. 13 years and four\nalbums later, the band has prospered,\nand I am a satisfied listener.\nHitparade is their fifth album, and is a collection of their most famous tunes\nremixed by some of Germany's better\ndance DJs in a variety of styles. And it is\nodd. Having not heard the band before,\nmy initial expectations were for something typically German - perhaps industrial metal worthy of a nuclear war, or\ngabba techno worthy of a thousand\nnosebleeds. But this is miles away from\neither - unusual, chilled techno electron i ca, with more than a few nods to hip-hop\nand trip-hop.\nFor me, the glorious moment on this\nalbum is the very understated Der Weg\nNach Nirgendwo. It's slow and brooding,\nbut pleasant too, like a ray of sunshine\nfalling on Tricky's dark musical world.\nThe vocals on this track, as on most of\nthe others, are supplied by simple\nspeech - we hear old men and young children smoothly rounding off the electronic\nrhythms, and it matters little if you can't understand the German.\nThere are some unfortunately cheesy\nmoments too, with a significant minority\nof tracks sounding like sub-standard Daft\nPunk grooves. But don't worry too much\nabout that - in general, the tracks on\nHitparade are usually fine and sometimes excellent.\nDerek\nVarious\nTony Hawk's... Out now on Maverick records\n[The full title is Music From And Inspired\nBy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3].\nSo this is a first - a soundtrack album for\na computer game. Not surprising really,\nsince music is being used more and more\nin computer games now. I confess\nthough that when I played Tony Hawk's( the game, that is), I didn't really pay\nmuch attention to the music 'cause I was\ntoo busy grinding.\nListening to this album, you can tell\nthat the songs are in the game. It's got\nthe skateboard y nu-metal and hip-hop\nfeel. It's got a few well known popular\nartists too, like Sum 41 (pic above), Alien\nAnt Farm, Outkast and Papa Roach.\nThis is gui tea good compilation, with\nonly one or two songs (out of 13 in total)\nwhich weren't worth another listen. One\ntrack that stood out was the NOFX song\nWhat's The Matter With Parents Today?,\nwhich has a classic line: \" Mum and Dad,\nI think you oughta stop smoking so much\npot\".\nThe Sum 41 track is just like their previous songs, with its upbeat theme, and\nOutkast's Bombs Over Baghdad has a cool beat.\nThe album also comes with an interactive CD, which has some clips' of Tony\nHawk talking about his various battle\nscars and some skateboarding stunts.\nThe menus would have looked a lot more\nimpressive played on something better\nthan a dying laptop.\nSo, to round up, this is not a bad compilation if you like your nu-metal/hip-hop\nthing, although I think only the biggest\nTony Hawk fan would contemplate buying it. Go on, prove me wrong.\nOscar\nmusic reviews\nOUT THIS WEEK Due out on Monday 21 January:\nSINGLES\nALKALINE TRIO - Private Eye\nBLACK REBEL M'C CLUB - Love Burns\nSTELLA BROWNE - Never Knew Love\nALBUMS CHECK ENGINE - On Top\nFugu\nFugu 1\nOut Monday 4 February on Ici d'aille urs From the cover - a'50s beach picnic\nscene - and the song titles - Ondulations,\nAngel Fair With Golden Hair - we can\nmake a good guess as to what this is\ngoing to sound like. French orchestral\nlounge music. Not that it sounds anything like Air the production and\narrangements give it more of a Beatles\nfeel, circa Abbey Road.\nThe tracks with float y female vocals\nsound incredibly like similar efforts from\nStereolab, though much less contrived.\nOn the flip side, the tracks with male\nvocals sound very much like Olivia\nTremor Control. In fact, most of the album\nsounds infuriatingly similar to some\nindeterminate one or another, almost as\nif it were a compilation of tracks by like-minded '60s inspired combos.\nOf course, Fugu 1 flows along better\nthan any compilation would. The tracks\nare so short (18 in 45 minutes) that the\nlistener drifts along, barely aware of the\nshifting tracks and the variety of instruments tickling and teasing the ears.\nThe album is loosely split into two\nparts and, although the interlude is barely noticeable, the subsequent track Au\nDepart indicates that something has\nchanged.\nThis is an exotic delicacy that can lead\nto disaster if incorrectly prepared.\nPerhaps I should give you a sardonic\nwarning of: \"don't try this in your bed-room\". Fugu's efforts haven't led to a cloying mu zak disaster, because they're\nnot trying to be too clever. The end product is not quite a delicacy, but an aural\nconnoisseur would have little to complain about.\nRobert\n\n"

    "content": "reviews clubbing 17\nNew Year's Eve with Ministry Of Sound\n@ The Millennium Dome\nThere are two sides to every story, or so\nthe clich e says, and Ministry of Sound's New Year's Eve event at the Millennium\nDome is no exception. People's expectations for the event were as extreme as\nthose for Episode I, and when you build\nsomething up like that, all you can really expect to be... is disappointed.\nI have heard people complain that\nthey spent an hour in the queue to get\nin, and another hour to get bar tokens.\nThey bitch about the state of the toilets\nafter midnight; they moan about\nBrandon Block being completely\nmashed. For me, these were no problem:\nI saw this as a festival and anticipated\nsuch things as eventualities. History has\nshown that the organisation of an event\nof this magnitude is guaranteed to be\nless than perfect. And sure, this wasn't the best night of my life, but it was a great, messy way to see in the New\nYear.\nI arrived at 7pm( when there was no\nqueue), and went straight in to find\nmyself in the belly of a monster: five are-nas, fifty DJs and only fourteen hours to\ndo it all in. As the Dome slowly became\npopulated, there was an opportunity to\nexplore the site as the sounds of MoS\nresident Gareth Cooke gradually\nwarmed up the crowd. Everything about\nthe place - the fairground, the food\nstalls, the stupid hats, the hooters - said\nthat this was a summer dance festival in\nmid-winter. The only difference being\nthat there was to be no mud, no sunstroke and definitely no rain.\nFor me, the party began with Frenzic\nin the World Dance tent. When this tent\nopened its doors at 8pm there was a deluge of people eager to get some of its\ndeep, high-energy vibrations. Within\nhalf-an-hour this place was boiling over.\nBack at the main stage, Ferry Corsten\ngot the crowd on their feet with a sizzling set of uplifting trance. By now, the\ngod-like sound system was thoroughly\nshaking the foundations (I stood near to\nthe left speaker stack and boy, do my\nears know it). Thousands of people of all\ndenominations were united by the\ndesire to party, and Ferry Corsten was\ngiving it to them.\nLooking over the event from the balcony of the Rulin arena, the whole thing\nwas put into glorious perspective. The\nrippling audience of the main stage, the\ndistant fairground, the lasers cutting\nacross the diameter of the dome. It was\nawesome.\nDick Clark duties for the night were\ntaken by Dave Pearce. For some, the\nthought of a \"Dangerous\" Dave Pearce\nset is as appealing as the Paul Daniels\nMagic Show. Whilst there was a minor,\nyet noticeable, tempo drop from Ferry\nCorsten's set to Pearce's( some people\nbehind me actually sat down and started rolling at this point), it was actually\ncomprised of some creditable records\nbolted together in a pleasing fashion.\nAt 11.50pm a giant countdown began\nin the main arena, and as the iron\ntongue of midnight tolled twelve they\ncracked open the visuals and as hit load of spectacular pyrotechnics exploded in\nand around the main stage. But once we\nhad hit the climax of midnight, I felt\nspent and in desperate need of a tiger\nnap. However, a belated Anne Savage\nset put a spell on the crowd like a voodoo incantation, summoning us to\ndance like zombies to her frenetic sound.\nBy the end of it I had used up that very\nlast drop of serotonin. No amount of\nenergy drinks could save me now.\nIt was three in the morning and the\nfloor of the dome was awash with empty\nplastic bottles and beer cans - which\nmade it a complete fucker to dance on.\nAround about this time, Siamese twins\nAlex P and Brandon Block appeared. It\nseemed that legendary can er Brandon\nBlock had gone a little too far in his celebrations - his awkward mixing stopped\nme in my tracks every time. This aside,\nhis sham boli c DJing still entertained,\nand his calling card \"Oi! Oi!\" was not\nleft out. Thankfully, Alex P stylishly finished off their set with some tight,\nthumping house.\nThe pristine toilets of the Millennium\nDome had by now descended into full\nfaecal chaos - inch-deep brown water\ngreeted anyone unlucky enough to need\nany kind of number. This was when I realised that the festival experience was\nfinally complete.\nWhen Tiesto eventually arrived, I was\nhoping he would revive my flagging\nspirits. Like his Gouryella co-producer,\nFerry Corsten, he specialises in uplifting\ntrance, and so I was hoping a little bit of\nthat might be just what the doctor\nordered. Alas, he just didn't get my fire\nburning.\nThe dawn set was taken by Judge\nJules, who turned in a diamond-edged\nperformance, pleasing the crowd without feeling the need to go an the mic. But\nI was aching for bed, and no DJ in the\nworld would have got me to dance.\nSunrise: brilliant lemon-coloured light\ncut through the glass of the east side of\nthe dome, gilding the interior, and dissolving the distant silhouettes of people.\nThat, and the clarifying morning chill,\ngave me a moment of lucidity, and for\nthe first time I felt like I was in 2002.\nPatrick\n\n"

    "content": "22 film reviews\nLord Of The Rings:\nFellowship Of The Ring\nAs one of the most hyped and e aged y awaited releases of last\nyear, many of you may have already seen Lord Of The Rings. For\nthose who haven't, it is a truly excellent film. It may not live up\nto its hype as the new Star Wars or the best move ever made,\nbut it's still definitely worth seeing.\nThe film opens with a brief run-down of the story of the ring\nthat immediately draws the viewer into Tolkien's fantasy world.\nThe special effects in this scene - and, indeed, though out the\nfilm - are among the most realistic I have ever seen. Director\nPeter Jackson follows in the epic footsteps of Ridley Scott (in the\nlikes of Blade Runner and Gladiator), creating a real yet alternative world, full of rich textural detail that aids the suspension of\ndisbelief. Moreover, the film as a whole is very atmospheric,\nfuelled throughout by a dark, brooding sense of dread.\nForeboding runs throughout, especially in the scenes with the\nring wraiths.\nAfter this opening, the pace slows as we are shown Hobiton\non the eve of Bilbo Baggins' birthday. Again the special effects\nare excellent, with the three and a half foot hobbits played by\ndigitally reduced actors. The film could quite easily have fallen\ninto farce and high camp without the naturalistic, solid performances by Elijah Wood and the other hobbit actors.\nOne of the most memorable scenes of the film is the fight\nbetween Gandalf and Saruman in Orcthanc (the tower of\nIsengrad). Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen are perfect for the\nroles of warring sorcerers and are truly realistic and frightening.\nHowever, there is a glaring continuity error: Saruman takes\nGandalfs's staff from him, yet it turns up later (with no explanation as to how it was returned).\nAnother major flaw with the film is the ending. Despite\nremaining true to the book, it's comes across flat, offering no\nsense of completion or finality - and consequently the film\nworks far less well as a movie in its own right than Star Wars.\nIt is this ending that stops Lord Of The Rings being as outstanding as other films like Goodfellas and Die Hard and moves\nit into the 'very good but not great' category.\nVa Savoir\nreleased 8th January\nLife is story, story is life. The Arts and their connection to the\nlives of those involved in them is a particular fascination of\nJacques Rivette; and he is back with it again in his new come-dy. In a previous film Rivette used Pericles as the central axis of\nthe narrative, and now for Va Savoir he has chosen Pirandello's As You Desire Me, a piece about illusion and identity. The film's six lead characters are all related in some way to a touring production of the play and the long sequences we are shown from\nperformances of it let us draw parallels between the actors'\nlives and those of their onstage personas, whilst at the same\ntime not allowing us to forget that the film we are watching is\nitself fiction.\nWith audiences dwindling, their production arrives in Paris,\nand the female lead, Jeanne Balibar, immediately re acquaints herself with an old beau, in an effort to alleviate boredom. This\nleaves her director, co-star lover, Sergio Castellitto, alone in his\nattempts to find the long-lost Goldoni manuscript that he\nbelieves will save his flagging company. Fortuitously he comes\nacross a beautiful young graduate, Helene de Fougerolles,\nwhose family just happens to have the entire Goldoni back catalogue - but de Fougerolles' loutish half-brother stands in the\nway of obtaining it and some careful man oe uv rings ensue.\nThe troupe's love-interest musical-chairs is a central to Va\nSavoir, with much farce-like humour coming from all the various\npartner swapping. The art/life blurring is good to watch, with\ncoincidences and overplayed scenes adding to the feeling of\nartifice, as exemplified by the hug gy kiss y, onstage happy end-ing.\nHaving previously made the titanic ally long Out One (over 13\nhours, if you were wondering), Rivette manages to stretch out\nthis comedy to a lengthy two and a half hours, but this does\nallow for a leisurely accumulation of humour and character is a tion. The first act is a little slow, but after that we are treated to\nthe fantastic, intellectual musings about love and art of the sort\nthat is only found in New Wave cinema. Quite simply, this is just\na lot of fun.\nAlex Dunbar Adam Joyce\n\n"

    "content": "Netball\nsport active\nICI18 ICSM 34\nWhat can we say... too much\ndrinking at School Disco & too\nmuch dac ning sore feet... well\nif we can't play netball, we\nhave to say we can play better\ndrinking games!\nWe started with scores drawing all the way, until they started getting more, that is. Ruthybaby was superb & quick\naround the court, and then\nClaire kept that ball from going\nout of the centre third. But even\nClaire (our medic who plays for\nthe right team!!) couldn't always stop the 6+ ft (we're\nsure there should be a height\nlimit in netball - if you can reach\nthe ring without jumping you\nshouldn't be allowed to play...\nrainbow coloured socks are\nalways going to put people off.\ntoo) shooter from getting the\nball. Kathryn kept the Goal\nAttack (GA) completely out of\nthe shooting by blocking her\nout of the 'D'. Beckie (out most\nvaluable player of the match)\nscored many amazing goals\nfrom all sorts of positions, and\nHannah, with her dancing\nspins, got free of her Goal\nDefence (GD) at every turn, finishing off with some beautiful\ngoals. Jess fought against\nHannah - a medic who had\ndecided to do trials with us, but\nnow plays for the medics... tra i tor! Just a few grunts and grimaces for the first match,\nthough in the 3rd and 4th quarters, the medics extended their\nlead, despite all our efforts. We\nplayed a good match, but\ncouldn't quite pull it off.\nJess\nNobody would have ever\nbelieved it. Five-nil to the\nladies' seconds! It was more\nthan we could ever dream of.\nThe match started with a smooth move from Bex taking\nthe ball into their half, which\nwas where it stayed for the\nLadies\nremainder of the game. Less\nthan five minutes in, our\nsupreme captain Nikki scored -we were all astonished. A couple of minutes later the two\nJens combined light forces\nresulting in Jenny D placing a nifty one past their keeper.\nHockey\nAfter some excellent defending\nof the centre line by Anita and\nSally, Chloe grabbed the ball\nand took he score to 3-0. Half\ntime came and passed, and our\nmagnificence was not sur-pressed. One more each from\nNikki and Jenny, some fantastic\nruns from Marianne, excellent\ntackles from Mary Hafia, and\nmarvellous defending from\nKaren H and the score stood 5-0\nas the final whistle blew. And where would we have been\nwithout the somewhat bored,\nbelly-shuffling Karen M in goal?\nRSM Football\nA cold January wind blew\nover the desolate, waterlogged\npitch. Stobbs wandered aimlessly from the changing rooms\nand by the time he reached the\npitch, the mighty RSM were 1-0\ndown, after only thirty sec-on ds. However, it was clear to\neveryone that this early surge\nwas just a flash in the pan.\nThe pitch glowed, the crowd\nsilenced and SOAS quivered in\ntheir feeble boots as the mighty\nex-skipper graced the field\nwith his presence. That was\nthe best it was ever going to\nget for SOAS, and by the looks\non their faces, they knew it.\nRob Thomas (the defensive\nprodigy) inspired the dynamic\nmovement of new left back,\nbionic Gaz Northam as he\nstormed up the pitch with the\ndebut ant extra or d in are Ludo\nby his side.\nSweet interplay was the\ntheme in the presence of the\nlegend, Sir Andy Mason who\nco-ordinated the rising stars' El Capitane Schluch-es-Menzies.\nLord Peter took the ball from\nwhat seemed an uncompromising position. He played what\nseemed an impossible ball\nthrough to the deviant yet\nexplicitly talented James\nStewert who split the defence\nlike a grade 1 clipper through a taliban's beard.\nDear Lord, Pete was great,\nLudo rolled a six, Bertie got\nshirt y and new keeper Johnnie\nplayed the strikers like a cheap\nGerman harmonica. Thanks to\nKen who scored four goals.\nFinal score: RSU 4-1 SOAS.\nLive sport on the BIG SCREEN\nSaturday 19th Jan.

    "content": "union talk\nNight-line is a confidential listening and\ninformation service provided by student\nvolunteers for students from all across\nLondon. Nightline, as it is now in London,\ncan find its roots here at Imperial where\nit was set up in 1971 following the suicide of a student the previous year. Over\ntime it expanded from Imperial to many\nparts of London and is currently associated with about '50 different institutions\nincluding Imperial. There are even\nNightlines in America, Canada and\nGermany.\nIt is essential for those students in difficulty, with emotional problems or worries to have someone they can talk to. To\nensure that someone is always available\nfor students to talk to, Nightline operates\nevery night during term time from 6pm to\n8am. Thus when offices are shutting\ndown and it is the normal time for counsellors and advisors to go home there is\nsomeone there for you to talk to. Thus it\ndoesn't act to replace others you can go\nand talk to (such as your friends, Warden,\nPersonal Tutor, College Counsellors etc,)\nNightline\nbut aims to provide a service when they\nare unavailable or if you want to talk to\nsomeone outside of where you study or\nlive.\nNightline isn'ta counselling service. It\nprovides those that ring with someone to\nhear their worries and problems. What\nthey do is listen, and then provide you\nwith any information you may need. They\ncan supply you with information on agencies and organisations, which you can\nthen contact in you own time, or phone\nlines, which can provide advice. The\nphone number is 020 7631 0101.\nThey also have a website from where\nyou can find out more about Nightline\nand how to volunteer if you wish to get\ninvolved. Also if you wish to talk to them\nby \"email listening\" you can find out more\ndetails on the website. Email listening is\na new service offered by Nightline and\nallows you to email them with you worries or re guests for information. The website address is www.nightline.org.uk\nIf you think you want to talk to some-one, regardless of the problem, the\nNightline website is a very good place to\nstart. It contains the links to many of the\nnations most frequently used welfare\nrelated websites, ranging from those\nconcerning Finances, through to Travel,\nCrime & Safety as well as the more \"obvious\" ones on sexuality, sexual health, and\nthe law.\nIt should also be noted here the benefits that could be obtained by helping to\nrun a service such as this. To volunteer, in\na manner such as this, in a truly unselfish\nway can bring personal rewards that will\nstay with you forever. Helping on a phone line like this one is an excellent\nway to give something back to the com-m unity, whilst making friends. It's not\nabout CV points, or job applications, or\nfirst/second/third interviews or theses or\nmoney; it's about doing something good.\nSimple as that. If you think you'd like to\nhelp, just call the number or visit the\nwebsite. I promise you you won't regret\nit.\nDavid\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare)\nStudents there for students.
