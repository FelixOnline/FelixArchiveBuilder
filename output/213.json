    "content": "10 FELIX Hockey : U.L. Cup Soccer\nHOCKEY IN FINAL\nBy E. Needham\nI.C.2 \u20141 Q.M. C. The I.C. Hockey team has\nwon its way to the final of the\nU.L. Cup for the first time in\nfour years. Having overcome\nC.E.M. in the quarter-finals, the\nhome side .found Q.M. C. an\neasier team to deal with on Wed.\nFeb. 3rd to Epping. However, as has often happened this\nseason, I.C. failed to produce\ntheir best form against a weak\nside.\nThe game started well for I.C. with a fine individual goal in the\n7th minute by Hough who dribbled 40 yd s. before finally beating the goalkeeper. However, a momentary lapse in the I.C. defence allowed Q.M. C. to score\nsoon afterwards but the rest of the\nhalf deteriorated into a stalemate.\nThe battering-ram tactics of the\nI.C. forwards met firm resistance,\nand the few breakaway attempts\nby Q.M. C. were easily halted.\nThe second half started in the\nsame vein as the latter part of the\nfirst until Stenning scored in the\n49th minute. Q.M. C. never recovered from this deficit, and the\nI.C. forwards were unlucky not\nto score at least three more goals.\nFives\nOne point\nmakes difference\nBy I. Collins\n\u2022If future matches can finish as closely as did this one against a combined University Colle.ee and\nUniversity College Hospital team,\nthe two I.C. strings at least will\nbe satisfied. I.C. won last years'\nfixture by the odd few points and\nthis added to the needle element\ninevitable in any contest with the\nBloomsbury Mob.\nPlay throughout the first three\nsets was very even, and before\nit had even begun, the match was\nobviously going to hinge on the\nlast set.\nIn retrospect, it seems odd that\nno-one totalled the scores at this\nstage, to see exactly how I.C. were placed. Anyway, the two\npairs playing last knew the points\nmargin to be small, whichever\nway it went, and played accord-ingly, until, in the second and last\ngame of this deciding set, I.C. were leading by 10 points to 4,\nand looked set for the match\u2014\nonly to lose 11-12!\nFeverishly, the points were\ntotalled. I.C. had lost by 74 pts.\nto 73 overall, being even on\ngames, 4 each.\nBadminton\nCHANCES GOOD\nBy M. Fitzgerald\nWith only four weeks of the\nseason left I.C. Men's and Mixed\nteams are in good positions to win\ntheir respective leagues.\nThe men's chances of retaining\nthe championship for the fourth\nyear running were increased recently when Kings lost to Northern\nPoly. This leaves N.P.' as the\nonly undefeated team in the\nleague, and I.C. have yet to play\nthem. A victory here would give\nboth teams the same number of\npoints.\nCambridge beaten\nRecent league victories have\nbeen recorded against Northampton 8-1, U.C.54, and I.C. II's. Last Saturday Cambridge Univ.\nII were defeated 5-4, G. Simnet\nand C. Woodward played their\nbest match of the season, winning\nall three games.\nThe mixed team is still unbeaten and victories over Kings\n6-3 and Battersea 9-0 have put\nthem into a strong position at the\ntop of the table.\nTO STUDENTS OF THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\n(On production of Membership Card)\n10% DISCOUNT\nON ALL GRAMOPHONE RECORDS\nRecords not stocked can be\nobtained within 24 hours\nCALL AT\nPH Y RECORD( o22, THURLOE STREET, S.W.7( at the foot of Exhibition Road)\nOpen Mon./Fri. 9.30\u20145.30\nSaturday 9.30\u20144.30\nEarly closing Thursdays\nEasy win by\nlovely I.C. By R. Grundy\nLC. 8 \u2014 3 Christ's Coll.\nAfter loss of the Cup and lowly\nleague pos i ion, the I.C. team did\nnot start the trip to Cambridge\nin extremely high spirits on Saturday, January 30th. To make\nmatters worse, the pitch was\nrock-hard and the victim of a very harsh cross-wind. From the\nflick-off. I.C. went straight into\nthe attack and surprised themselves with some clever and well-thought-out football. They eventually scored when Kemp latched\non to a through ball from Eastell\nand cracked in a right foot shot.\nHe made it two when he again\nnetted from a similar position.\nQuiet Blues\nLittle was seen of the Christs\nattack which contained three\nUniversity players, for they had\nlittle support, and when they did\nreceive the ball they seemed slow\nagainst a well organised I.C. de-fence. However, when Hunt made\nno mistake in beating Wojtowicz\nin the I.C. goal.\nI.C., however, were in full\ncontrol and scored two quick\ngoals. Firstly, Wellfair deflected\na pass from Luxton into the net\nand then Kemp notched his third\nwhen he shot into the net from\nclose range. The visitors clearly\nhad midfield domine n ce at this\nstage with Morland and Eastell\nparticularly prominent, and it was\nno surprise when Eastell headed\nin from a left wing centre to make\nit five.\nMore Goals\nAfter half time things were more\nsven and Christs came near to\nj coring on a number of occasions,\neventually succeeding when the\ninside-forward scored from a dubious offside position. This goal\nseemed to spark off even more\neffort in the I.C. attack which\np weeded to put the issue beyond\nail doubt when Kemp and Luxton\nadded further goals. Moreland\nthen came up into the attack to\nadd his own particular brand of\nhumourous play in making the\ntally eight. Christs added a late\nconsolation goal from their centre\nfor wa;I, but were indeed a disheartened side.\nThis was a good win for I.C. who played good football throughout and, although winning by a large margin still tried to the\nfullest extent and never lost their\ninterest.\nPresent Premier League Positions\nKings 7 6 0 25 8 12\nQ.M.

Carnival Lunches are on Fridays in the Union Concert Hall, noon till 2 p.m. For only 2/- you can eat as\nmuch as you like of assorted rolls and drink as much orange or\nlemon squash (not n times diluted !) as you want, to the accompaniment of canned music and live jazz.\nTickets are being sold all over the place, but failing other\nsources, you can usually get some from Stan or the cloakroom attendants. Come along this Friday\u2014and bring your friends with you.\nThe New Carnival Office is in Southside\u2014the committee room\nbelow the bridger-and-chess room. Every lunchtime there will be\nsomeone to enlist your help or answer your enquiries (phone Internal\n3342).\nThe old Carnival Office in the Union has been closed.\nThe Carnival Magazine is due\nout in mid-April, with a new look\n(as Felix reported in December).\nThis year we shall be paying I.C. students 6d. to take the special\nstudent supplement!)\nThe general public will for 2/6\nor more receive only the maga-zine,, but students will get this\nplus their supplement for 2/-.\nIt is completely different to\nsome previous carnival magazines,\ncontaining both funny and serious\narticles,\nThe 8-page supplement will be\ncrammed with jokes\u2014for I.C. perusal only!\nStall Building. Do you feel\nenergetic ? If so, why not come\nand help build one of the stalls\nto be set up in such big local\nstores as Harrods or Pontings.\nMaybe you know some big organisations through which we\ncould sell our magazines.

He was perhaps encouraged by the Debating\nSociety's new p retention s at formal dress.\nThe motion that \" This house would retain the death penalty \"\nwas carried by 31 votes to 21 against (with 6 abstentions).\nNO SUBSTITUTE\nEdward Gardner, Q.C., Tory\nM.P. for Billericay, proposing,\nassured us that \"The retention is ts were not impelled by any irrational or unhealthy emotions.\"\nThere was no substitute for the\ndeath penalty, he argued, but\nadmitted that \" You cannot\nmeasure the deter rant effect of\nhanging.\" The police, who were\nmost intimately concerned with\nviolent crime, demanded re ten Student faces have changed, but surely student\nfeeling is comparable\u2014or have we all been\nnumbed into disinterest in the Beatle-era ? What\nis discussed at a Union Meeting concerns every\none of us\u2014not merely for our own welfare but\nalso that others following us may benefit from our\nadvice.\nSo, before 18th February, let's pull our socks\nup, take an interest in what's going on, make other\npeople interested, and get all this wretched business over before it's held over to the next academic year and, meantime, we grovel in our old conf u si(3nD.I.

FINDINGS\nDr. David Kerr, a medic and\nLabour MP noted that the UN\nreport on capital punishment had\nfound that judges and jurists were\ngenerally in favour of retention\nwhilst more ph y chi atri sts and\nsociologists preferred abolition.\nThere were more exceptions than\napplications of capital punish-ment, he said, and cited pre g nancy, insanity, and youth. The\n1957 homicide act was irrational\nlegislation, and the supposed\ndeterrent had not been proved to\ndeter.\nThe battle was then transferred\nto a more a e the rial level with\nFather Ivor Smith-Cameron's4 point opposition argument that\nthe deterrent was ineffective, a negation of the Christian principle\nof reform; he further argued that\njuries were often reluctant to convict a man to hang, and pointed\nout amidst rather misplaced\nlaughter from the House, that\nlarge numbers of bloodthirsty perverts applied to the Home Office\neach week to be hangmen. The\nRev. Kinder, for the proposition,\ngave the Scriptures the retention is t slant \"God deals in strict justice,\"\nhe said and quoted \"Vengeance is\nmine saith the Lord.\" He seemed\nto think that vengeance was a state privilege too.\nWEAK SUPPORT\nJames Mulcahy, a legal brain\nand Old Etonian, took rather a long time to make his proposition\nspeech relevant.

On a fine but bit er lv cold\nafternoon IC. took another step\nnearer winning the Gutteridge\nCup when hey over whl med Universi y Col'e ge at Shenley by\n20\u20143. After exercising complete\nsuperiority in the first half, I.C. rather slackened their grip, but a U.C. side dogged with slipshod\npassing and slow thinking could\nmake little headway and seldom\nlooked dangerous.\nThe credit for I.C's triumph\nmust go to the cool y efficient halfback partnership of Weisner and\nMills, together with some superb\nbacking up and loose play by the\nforwards. In this phase of the\ngame the back row was out stand ing, Davies having one of his best\nmatches to date while Hammerton\nand Turner were ever on hand to\nsnap up the loose ball and launch\nanother attack. In the tight,\nHowell dominated the first half\nbut fell away in the second. In\nfact the only black spot was some\nindifferent line-out play where a total lack of protection for the\njumper cut the supply of clean\nballs to a minimum.\nRiley Dangerous\nIn the back division, Riley was\neasily the most dangerous runner\non the field, while Turton and\nDavison in the centre marred an\notherwise good performance by a tendency to over elaborate, a policy that gave winger Chapell\nonly two passes throughout the\nentire match. The defence though\ngiving the spectators some anxious moments proved adequate\nMolam at full-back did efficiently\nthe little he was called on to do.\nThe game, started five minutes\nlate by a referee whose knowledge\nof the rules appeared to be as\nmodern as his shorts, soon saw\nI.C. firmly encamped in the opposition's half and after only seven\nminutes the first try came from\nDavison who dived over three\ndefenders to score\u2014the kick\nfailed.\nGORDON LOWE S The ideal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brompton Arcade,\nKnlghtsbridge. S.W.3 KEN 4494/5/6\nA period of intense I.C. pressure followed, the lead being increased to 6\u20140 some ten minutes\nlater through a penal y goal by\nTurner. The next score seemed\nonly a mater of time and in fact\ncame from a scrum outside the\nU.C.\"25.\" Howell won the ball against the\nhead and Mills breaking blind,\nagain found Turner at his elbow.\nThe Captain took the ball, broke\nclean and drawing the defence\nsent Riley over for an un converted try. This brought the\nscore to 9-0 where it remained\nuntil just before half time when\ntwo more tries came in quick\nsuccession. The first of these and\nthe best of the match was initiated\nby scrum half Weisner who broke\nround the back of the line out and\nturned back into the pack; here\nMetcalf took the pass and tore\nsome 20 yd s. before scoring wide\nout. Two minutes later Riley went\nover again. After half-time, a rally by U.C. seemed to take the\nedge off the visitors and though\nRiley, and on several occasions\nDavis, came near to scoring the\nefforts were those of individuals\nrather than the team. However,\nU.C. made little headway and\nafter half an hour their fate was\nsealed when Davison took a rather\nforward looking pass from Hammerton to score near the posts.\nTurner made hard work of the\nconversion scraping it over\ncrossbar and upright. This took\nthe score to 20-0 where it remained until the dying seconds\nwhen an interception gave U.C. a consolation try.\nThus what must be the College's best XV in the last five years\nmove on to the semi-final, and if\nthey can only last the latter half\nof their remaining matches as they\nplayed the first half of this, victory\nat Motspur on March 6th must\nbe more than possible.\nIngram in the I.C. goal demonstrates his strong kick against Kings in\nthe Cup game\nSoccer : U.L. Cup\nMiserable Display\nShatters Cup Hopes\nBy P. Walton\nLC. 2\u20146 Kings College\nOn a day well suited to good\nfootball, LC. were beaten by\nKings at Harlington in the second\nround of the U.L. Cup. Kings\nwon the toss and I.C. kicked off,\nonly to see Kings mount an\nimmediate attack.\nHowever, the first quarter\nshowed honours even, but the\nI.C. defence had already shown\ndangerous flaws, and the talent-packed attack had made little\nheadway.\nKings went 1-0 in the lead after\n19 mins. from their centre-forward, and after some near\nmisses by I.C. Kings increased\ntheir lead by a header from the\nlift winger. However I.C. retaliated in the 35th minute, with a goal by Batcup from a Huxtable\ncross, but Kings scored again on\nhalf time, giving them a31 lead.\nIN TOUCH WHERE HAVE ALL THE WATCHERS GONE ?\nThe Soccer Club have been knocked out of the U.L. Cup in the\nsecond round; the Hockey Club are through to the final of their U.L. Cup, and today the Rugby Club meet Q.M. C. in the semi-final of\nGutteridge Cup.\nBefore each cup game, notices and lists are put up in the Union\nand Southside, and Felix always advertises the fact that free coaches\nare being provided for supporters.\nA total of about ten people watched, encouraged and cheered\nall the hockey and soccer games, and the soccer team received the\nsupport of four (two of them hockey players) on a day when most\nfootball games and all hockey matches were cancelled. The Rugby\nClub, it must be admitted is better off.\nThe winning of the various U.L. trophies means a great deal for\nthe prestige of the College and the Union and as anyone from Liverpool will agree a large following of support must do much to meet\nthis end.\nPerhaps the Constituent Unions can do more in the way of organisation of supporters, and win or lose a\" social\" evening can inevitably\nbe offered as a reward.\nIn the second half the visitors\nscored three more goals, two from\nthe inside left and one from the\ncentre forward, while I.C. scored\nfrom a penalty (Huxtable).\nThis was a very disappointing\ndisplay by what on paper seemed\na very strong I.C. team, and thus\nfor the first time in seven years\nthe mighty I.C. have failed to\nreach the final. This might not\nhave been so if the I.C. defence\nhad settled down earlier to contain the King's inside-left who\ncompletely outwitted all attempts\nto foil his magnificent hat-trick.\nI.C.

It looks as if I.C. could well repeat last year's top\nof the league success in an even\nmore convincing fashion. Three\nplayers have featured strongly in\nI.C.'s big wins. Clarke and\nRandall have shared the goal-scoring honours while Stapley has\nalways been a tower of strength in\nmid-pool. Davis also deserves\nmention for his sporting tactics\nagainst Guy's star, Valentine,\nwhose goal-scoring efforts were\ncompletely forestalled. One sad\naspect of the league matches so\nfar is that goalkeeper Banyard\nhas not been given much practice.\nBanyard will need all his fine\nabilities when I.C. face the big\nguns of U.C. later this term.\nResults :\nl.

I think I understand why no approach was made by the Union, to find out\nour opinions on U.G.C. expenditure here at I.C., but, nevertheless, we\nhave something to say. May I be excused for using this method of\npetitioning Council, but other channels of communication seem\nstagnant\nAlthough the U.G.C. is concerned only with capital grants to the\nCollege for building, maintain en ce, salaries of the College Establishment, etc., and not with Students' Maintainence Grants, which are\nassessed by another body {with which we are in communication), I would like to point out th re ways in which the U.G.C.' s policies affect\nstudents at I.C.(1) The U.G.C. has delayed the aid wh icl h they had promised\nfor the sports centre in Princes' Gardens. As the number of\nstudents at I.C. will soon be over 3,500, much greater facilities\nthan are at present planned will be needed, and a start should be\nmade now.\n(2) The U.G.C. should be congratulated for the many fine\nbuildings which we now have particularly in the City and Guilds\nCollege, but the urgent need of a new Chemistry Building should\nbe vigorously stressed.\n(3) The U.G.C. s lio ul d be asked to provide funds to the College\nwhich will allow for the fullest application of all the modern\ntechniques for the communication of information from the staff\nto the students.\nYours faithfully,\nKEITH CAVANAGH,\n(Chairman, Student Group, A.

WALKER\nThis year Felix has attracted more advertising than ever before\nand Felix has also increased in size. However, this is not due to\nthere being any large surplus of articles sent in. In this issue the copy\namounts to less than half that carried in any of the issues of last\nterm. The Felix staff have produced their usual amount, but very\nfew others have contributed anything.\nIf you want a good flourishing paper then it is your job to make\none\u2014we cannot invent news or be at every function taking place in\nthe Union. Our reporters write articles on a few of the more interesting meetings, but a lot must remain uncovered.\nIf necessary the Felix staff can rewrite any article submitted.\nWe may be able to provide a photographer if we are informed of any\nmeetings that might need one. We cannot write 10,000 words ourselves for every issue and have no intention of attempting to do so.\nFelix wants to give a broad outlook on I.C. life; there are over\neighty clubs in the Union but how many have ever submitted an\narticle, let alone written regularly ? We guarantee to print any\nreport submitted by a Union club, but reserve the right to edit an\narticle. We may, if need be, hold over any article to the following\nissue but we will make every effort to print it.\nSTUDENT OFFICERS\nWho gets the last half pint in\n.the Union bar? The person who\nhas his name at the bottom of a little black piece of peg board in\nthe Union. That is the day's duty officer, and it is his painful\nduty to ensure law and order in\nthe Union.\nHe is responsible for closing the\nbar on time or before if it gets\ntoo rowdy. He must then clear\nall the drunkards and television\naddicts out of the place before he\nlocks up. He is in charge of all\nthe Union staff and can eject\nanybody who makes a nuisance\nof themselves, he in fact speaks\nfor the Union.\nIt is a most unenviable job, and\nis shared between the senior members of the Union on a rota basis.\nCouldn't we all be a little more\nco-operative and make his job a little easier?\nTIME FOR\nThe Long Vacation\nJUST TIME FOR\nWINTER SPORTS\nAND\nSPRING HOLIDAYS\nEither or both of these publications can be obtained\nfree, with application form, from :\u2014\nN.U.S. TRAVEL3, Endsleigh Street, London, W.C. I Please send , ...^\nName\nAddress\nDate\nBACKWARDS INTO THE I.C.E. AGE\nC There is one section of the community who have\nno reason to pine for the Utopia of the seventies,\nwhen College redevelopment is completed. 1\nspeak of the car owners, especially students. You\nO see, we're just not supposed to own cars\u2014you can\nspend all your grant on beer, women, fags, clothes,\netc., but to do without these and run a car instead\nis definitely immoral, it just won't do. \" So what?\"\nsay you (if you're a car owner) \" I can still find\nLa place to park, so it doesn't matter what the\nauthorities think ! \" Yes, but what about the\nday when there are parking meters on the street\nand the Imperial Institute Road and South-Side\ncar parks are no longer there. \" That's alright,\"\nC you reply triumphantly, \" it's all being looked\nafter by the car parking com mi Use.\" But that,\nmy friend, is the biggest laugh of the lot. This\nnoble body, which has had at least one meeting in\nthe last six months, appears to be pursuing, with\nU an enviable tenacity, the policy of reducing\nCollege parking space by as much as possible.\nOn November 24th, they aspired to an all time\nlow with a long discussion on subtle ways and\nmeans of undercutting the LCC's requirements of\nTa minimum of 300 parking places on fie central\nsite. This, when the LCC requirements themselves\nare generally accepted as underestimates, to say\nthe least. Honestly, if this sort of thing happens\nin an institution bursting at the seams with tech-Tno logical brain power, then Prof. Buchanan might\nas well have a ceremonial burning of all his\nreports, and find some other profession. There is\njust no hope for the rest of the country !\nWHERE ARE THEY NOW ?\nAt the beginning of the College year, with fresh Union officers\nall rearm' to go, many innovations and reforms are promised. By\nthis time, however, most have been forgotten. One victim of this\nphenomenon, which did in actual fact get off the ground for a few\nhectic weeks last term, is the broadsheet giving details of student\nevents in the College each week. I am told that this will reappear\n\" sometime,\" but this is not in my opinion an adequate answer. The\nU.C. Broadsheet which appears weekly outside the Union office from\nsome divine source is not, Mr. Price, a substitute for one of our own.\nThe much vaunted advertising and notice-board reform doesn't seem to have materialise d either\u2014and we are now even lumbered\nwith a monstrous additional double sided board, which obscures all\nexternal affairs notices and takes up too much room in the Union\nentrance hall. Also, while on the subject, I request the executive to\nbanish all unaddressed publicity material from the letter racks. If\nother societies follow the regrettable example of the Motor Club, and\nadvertise their dinners in this way, there soon won't be any room for\nletters. Not that anyone sends me any!\nFelix Staff\nASSISTANT EDITOR Business\nD.I.

The visitors\nwere amazed that such meals are available to students in the college.\nOn the Wednesday morning, a hired coach took the visitors on a tour of London, and in the afternoon they were given the opportunity\nof meeting some of the R.S.

This was the\njoyful news from the Refectory\nCommittee's Meeting of 3rd Feb.\nDespite increases in the cost of\nfood, an extra 3d. an hour on the\nwages bill, and a loss of \u00a3170 on\nthe first five months of this financial year the Committee decided\nto peg prices at the present level.-They hoped that this freeze will\nlast well into next year.\nAlso you will still be able to\ndrink your pint for only 2/- cost.\nNationally most leading brands, of\nbeer went up a penny a pint a few months ago. A stabilized\nretail price list of all beverages is\nto be posted in all College Bars\nincluding Weeks Hall. Whole\nKeg Barrels prices are also to be\nstandardized around the college,\n(this will show a10/ reduction\nin some cases).\nThe other interesting point\nraised was the possibility of having a grill on the Union Bar\ncounter. But this proposal has to\ngo to Council for further discus-sion.\nGENERAL STUDIES\nU.S.A. \u2014States' Rights\nv. Federal Power\nOn Tuesday, last week, the first\nof a series of lec'.ure s on the U.S. was given by Miss Karlynn Himman, B.A.( Utah), MA.( Rad-cliffe), a visiting Fulbrigbt Research Scholar, and poli ical\nscientist.\nAny ice was broken by the\nspeaker announcing that that\nparticular day (February 2nd) was\na National Event, in the U.S. calendar ; \u2014 Groundhog day!\nThese small woodchucks indicate\nweather conditions; if they can\nsee their own shadows, there will\nbe six weeks more of winter(?)\nReturning to the subject of the\ntalk,\u2014the very topical one of\nwhat role the federal government\nshould play, and of how much\npower this should wield in State\nmatters,\u2014Miss Hinman seemed\ngenerally to be in favour of the\nfederal government having more\ncontrol in the various spheres.\nThe U.S.A. was originally intended to be a loose confederation of almost autonomous States,\nWe are', said Henry Ford at the International Ford Conference in Paris,\n'in the people business'. At Ford we know that quality in cars depends\non the calibre of men. The pace of your career with us depends on that\ncalibre as surely as the speed of your car depends on the power built into it.\nFord build more and more cars, trucks and tractors, need more and more\nmen. The headquarters of this expanding company is in Brentwood, Essex,\nbut Ford is going ahead in London, Dagenham and Liverpool.\nWe need ALL kinds of graduates\u2014mechanical engineers, for design and\ndevelopment; arts men, scientists and economists. The technological\nrevolution came long ago at Ford.\nAnd training for a progressive career takes prime place at Ford.\nEngineers follow a two-year graduate apprenticeship designed to meet\nI. Mech. E. requirements; there/are.courses for finance trainees and graduate trainees\u2014those interested in sales, purchase, industrial relations\nand marketing.\nGraduates will find Ford rewarding I Salaries begin at an \u00a3876 minimum.\nMost arts and economics graduates will be earning \u00a31,128 in less than\na year\u2014engineers get an increase of \u00a396 at the end of the first year's apprenticeship and at least eno thor \u00a396 at the end of their second.\nFrom then on acceleration depends on you. v Promotion at Ford is traditionally from within and graduates have accelerated quickly here. Management Development operates to make sure\nthey can.\nThere's much to interest the graduate at Ford.\nSee your Appointments Board, or write for details to J.S. Smale.\nRoom 1/174, Ford Motor Company, Warley, \u2014 ^ \u2014\nBrentwood, Essex, who will be visiting\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\non\n3rd MARCH OF BRITAIN with the Federal Court, only\nhaving jurisdiction, war defence\nand inter-state commerce; (and\nnot over even criminal law).\nThis subject is of very recent\ninterest, and since Goldwater,\nwho expressed for states rights,\nlost the election, it would seem\nthat perhaps the states would\nloose even more rights in the\nfuture. The speaker concluded\nthat the trend was definitely towards increased federal power\nalthough she did not think that\nthe states would ever be eclipsed;\nand that the whole problem was\nvery complex with no clear so lu tion.\nA very interesting talk, which\nsets quite a high standard for the\nremainder of the series\u2014which\ndeserve more support than the\nfirst talk got.\nKENSINGTON\nSOUND 1965\nMost of the items for this year's Carnival Record will be recorded\nwithin the next two weeks.\nThanks to an Old Centralian,\nprofessional equipment will be\nused this year, and the final product should be comparable to\ncommercially issued discs.\nThe record will contain all the\nCollege war-cries, which will be\nrecorded live at the forthcoming\nUnion meetings. An R&B arrangement of a certain Bar\nSong is envisaged; the Jim\nSwingle singers have been commissioned to utter forth; and\nmicrophones have been seen\nspringing up at Hootenanies, behind pianos and refectory serving\ncounters.\nThe design of the special\nsouvenir cover has been kept a closely guarded secret. Felix can,\nhowever reveal that it will contain \" Price 7/6 \"\nD.G.B. One Act Festival\nMid-March will see an interesting new venture enacted jointly by\nthe Dramatic Societies of the Royal College of Art, Royal College\nof Music and Imperial College, when they present a festival of one-act plays. Detailed plans for the event have now been settled.\nThe hall of the new R.C.A. building, where the plays will be\nperformed on the evenings of 16, 17 and 18 March, will present a challenge to actors, stage crews and audience alike. In keeping with\nits setting the drama too will be contemporary.\n\" Next Time I 'll Sing To You,\" the first act of which is the choice\nof I.C.D.

R.C.A. remain undecided, but\ntheir offering will certainly be\ncontemporary, for plays by Pinter, Ionesco and Beckett are at\npresent being considered.\nI.C MUSICAL SOCIETY (OPERA GROUP)\nI0LANTHE\nFrom February 22nd to 26th\" Iolanthe \" in the Concert Hall,\nis an amusing fantasy involving\nof fairies led by a militant queen,\nWayfarers, plays in the title role.\nThis year's production team is\nled by a B.B.C. television author\nwho has had much experience\nwith amateur productions. As\nI.C. orchestra held a concert at\nthe beginning of February, they\nhad not enough time to rehearse\nfor \" Iolanthe also. Instead, an\norchestra was formed by students\nfrom the Royal College of Music\nplus a few from I.C. so the\nstandard of playing should be\nvery high.\nRehearsals, which have been\ntaking place since.

We\nthe Opera Group will be presenting\nThis work hy Gilbert and Sullivan\nthe House of Lords and a horde\nAnn Hay. who also sings with the\nhope that as many people as possible will support us by coming\nto see it.

    "content": "4 FELIX Guildfinger\nThe column born of our age,\nreplacing the old Spannerama.\nThe column that gives you the\nnews and views of Guildsmen.\nby Brian King\nThe standard of entries is\nextremely high. The prize for\nthe winners is four bottles' of\nwine, including a bottle of Bollinger Champagne. The judges will\nbe Messrs. Allen, Hardwick,\nThrosby, Schroter and Solomon.\nThe prize for the viewers is at\nleast one hours high quality,\nunique entertainment. And it is\nall happening at the Guilds Union\nMeeting, Thursday February 11th at one o 'clock, in room 542\nMech. Eng., and it's called the\nGuilds \" Festival of Music and\nCulture.\"\nAnother important matter to be\ndiscussed at the Union Meeting,\nis the Film, which is to be \" Shot\nin the Park \" in late February.\nThe film is in many ways significant of the change of attitude\nwithin Guilds Union, and perhaps\nthe middle of the year is the best\ntime for an appraisal of the present situation.\nThe endeavours of the Executive may conveniently be subdivided into three broad sections:\n(1) Academic: it became obvious at the end of last year that\nA. Sc.W. was making a determined attempt to grasp power in\nImperial College. This college\nwas for two reasons an obvious\nchoice for an attempt at a\" coup.\"\n(a) there is a prev a lant disinterested student majority, who\nclaim that the constituent college\nUnions are too childish in outlook.\n(b) Imperial is this country's most important Technical institution and any organisation claiming\nto represent the students within\nthe College, is assured of powerful\nallies.\nThe dyke was breached, and\nthe valley looked as if it would be\nflooded by the tide of enthusiasm.\nIn Guilds the attempt already\nis, and can be seen to be, a failure.\nIt was doomed in its prenatal\nstate, for, at the beginning of this\nsession, the Guilds Executive had\nrealised that the academic subcommittee was radically altered.\nThe reformulated committee, was\ndepartment ally sub sectioned, and\ncomposed of equal numbers of\nsenior staff and students from that\ndepart me. it, who were concerned\nmainly with the curriculum of\ntheir own department. Each of\nthese committees report their\nfindings to the Union General\nCommittee, who after final .cor-relation, present the report to the\nDean. Since the staff are brought\nin at ground level, the report carries far more weight.\n(2) Other Changes: Another\ncommittee to be examined in detail was the Colours Sub-committee, where new directives for\nthe proposal of colours have been\ndrawn up and implemented.\nThe whole operation has been\ncombined with an investigation\ninto the structure of Guilds\nUnion, and its powerful affiliations, through the Old Centralians, epi tomis ed by the Union's important contribution to the\nLord Mayor's Show.\nThe Freshers' Dinners have\nbeen d's cussed at some length,\nand a firm suggestion for a re-orient a ion of the dinners will be\nput to next year's Executive. The\nlive Heads of Department and the\nDean have been consulted, and\nall viewed these recommendations\nwith great favour.\n(3) The Societies: The societies\nwithin Guilds are continually improving the facilities offered to\nmembers. Perhaps an outstanding\nexample is the Radio Society,\nwhich is not only giving complete\nclosed-circuit television coverage\nof the Engineers Dinner and\nDance, but is also hoping to\ntransmit vision on a U.H.F. Link\nin the near future. The . other\nsocieties are offering a strong\np'rogramme despite lack of sup-port.\nGuilds has not, nor never will\nlose its sense of humour, and the\n\"sport\" is of the utmost im-port ance. It is agreed by the\nmajority of experts on education\nthat books alone are not an education and one of the most important factors which contributes to\na well-rounded character is sociability. One, and perhaps the\nmost important sources of these\nexperiences is (he Union. To improve communication within (he\nUnion, a Guilds Diary has been\nput up on the Notice Board in\nMech.

    "content": "MEETING DEBACLE\nThe Warden, Dr. J.R. Butler,\nlevelled criticisms at the stair\nrepresentatives for not giving\nsufficient publicity for his having\nto cancel the first Keogh Hall\ndinner of term on February 1st. He suffered the embarrassment of\nhaving to cancel his invitations to\ntwo members of staff, but hopes\nthat this action will not nee I to\nhi repeated. More organisation\nwa'i needed on the student level.\nDr. Butler and his assistant,\nHugh Dowley, who each invited\na guest, regarded last term's dinners as a useful experiment in\nfurthering amicable relations between the staff and the students.\nA Hall meeting this term endorsed their opinion.,\nThe average attendance at these\ndinners was between a dozen and\ntwenty, but only about 30 of the\n72 Hall residents ever seemed to\ntake part. This term old \"Keogh-loe ian s\" were invited to attend.\nTHE VALUE OF DINNERS\nThis is by no means the first\nattempt by the Southside overlords to run regular Hall dinners.\nMr. Seaford has held dining-in\nnights for Selkirk and Dr.\nCameron has run a number of\n\"closed shop\" dinners for Tizard.\nDr. Butler felt that his dinner*\nrepresented \" A genuine effort on\nthe part of the staff to spend an\nextra mural evening with the boys\"\nAfter dinner, there was general\ndiscussion over beer and coffee;\ntalking shop was avoided at all\ntimes. Later, perhaps in the\nsummer term, Dr. Butler hopes to\ninvite guests from outside the\ncollege.\nOn improving staff-student relationships in general, the Keogh\nwarden feels that there is a far\ngreater interest taken by the staff\nthan by the students. \"There are,\"\nhe said, \" few voices among the\nstudents.\"\nD.I. W. Many Serious Questions Remain Unanswered\nStudent apathy ruined another great Imperial College Union institution to-day, when yet\nanother in quo rate General Meeting had to be postponed for a fortnight. The next I.C. Union Meeting\nwill convene in the Concert Hall at 1.15 p.m. on Thursday, 18 February.\nApathy was expressed not merely by the poor attendance (few more than 200 people composed\nthe audience\u2014300 are required to make a Meeting quo rate) but more particularly by die Union\nexecutive and proposer s of motions.\nThere must be more adventurous advertising for future Union Meetings. Without rummaging through official noticeboards for non-eye-catching posters, few will have known what subjects\nwere being discussed, let alone take the trouble to attend. Further, the standard Union Meeting\nnotices gave no indications as to which side the proposer s' bread was buttered\u2014one had to read\nthe insignificant typed sheets on.Council notice- | the start of the academic year. I am informed\nthat there have been anu umber of \"N.U.S. forums\"; the last was on 28th January, but received no publicity and attracted but TWO\nPEOPLE ! More recently. Mr. Utting went to\nwork with his magic marker and weakly urged\npeople to attend the mammoth tea-party to discuss N.U.S., and several paper slip c explaining the\nadvantages of joining N.U.S. have littered various\nflat surfaces whence students might pick them up.\nThe Union executive might take a tip from the\nDebating Society. Struggling though it is, its\nattendances are up on last year's due largely to\ngreater publicity. Union Meetings must be advertised freely\u2014bigger, more detailed and more picturesque posters are required not only in the\nUnion building but also jn the departments and\non the hoarding s biding college reconstruction.\nContinued on p.2 boards in the .Union lounge or Southside to discover that Mike Edwards was PROPOSING\nTHAT WE JOIN N. UJS. or that Keith Cavanagh\nwas proposing that a CONFERENCE BE HELD\nTO DISCUSS LECTURING METHODS. From\nSecretary Utting's posters no one can be blamed\nfor imagining the meeting to be just one big tea-party where everyone could sit around and chat\nabout N. UJS. and lecturing over a cup pa. But Mr. Utting's door is not the only one at\nwhich blame must be laid. Surely Mr. Cavanagh\nand his supporters could have given a great buildup stressing to students the need for a lecturing\nmethods conference. To add more interest, the\nopposition could have produced an equally impressive publicity campaign.\nThe pro-N.U.S. team have never seemed to\nwake up to a situation until it is too late.

The radiation emitted\nis electromagnetic and occurs\nwhen an electron, having been\nexcited to a higher energy level\nthan its normal one, falls back to\nits more stable low energy state.\nThe radiation produced itself\nstimulates emission, and if there\nare sufficient excited electrons\npresent, a rapid amplification occurs and a high energy pulse can\nbe obtained. The excitation may\nbe done electromagnetic ally, or\nwith intense light from a flash\ngun. PN junctions of semiconductors can also produce laser\naction under direct electrical\nstimulation by a similar process.\nGases, semiconductors and solids,\nhave been made to \" las e.\" The uses of Lasers in various\nforms already form an impressive\nlist. They can be to great advantage in spectrograph ic analysis of\nminute samples, in range finding\non the surface of the earth as well\nas objects as far away as the\nmoon (satellites), also to weld\nmicroscopic wires or human tissue\nin the eye\nA more tar reaching possibility\nis that of obtaining gamma radiation by laser action. This would\nbe the DEATH RAY of science\nfiction writers come true. The\nshortest wavelengths yet obtained\nare however still within the visible\nspectrum, and we may hope to\nhear more favourably of lasers\nbefore we fear being struck dead\nby them.\nD.S.V.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nTHE CASE AGAINST JOINING N.U.S. Put by C.P. BURDESS\nPenelope Williams and Mike Edwards wrote in last Felix that\nI.C. must stop being parochial and join N.U.S. It really is an\nexcellent idea that all students should get together and discuss their\nviews in a national body, but we have only to look at N.L'. S. to\nsee what has happened to this fine theory when formally put into\npractice.\nIf we went into N.U.S. we would be able to send our delegate\nto council (\u00a3100 or SO'\u2014what an improvement!) and add our block\nvote to a demand for increased grants. At the last N.U.S. conference\nthat motion was the only one voted on\u2014the rest of the time was\ntaken up with points of order, leaving several hundred other motions\nuntouched. Public opinion was not swayed in favour of N.U.S. by the reporters of national newspapers, who were thoroughly bored\nby the meeting.\nSeveral firms find it. commercially advantageous to get free advertisement through N.U.S. by cutting their profit margins some-what. The same firms approached by individual non-N.U.S. students\nwould most probably give a reduction if aware that the student\nis \" shopping around \" for discount.\nEMPLOYMENT FIASCO\nNUS also runs a vacation al employment scheme (non-vocational). It puts up two types of\nnotices on NUS boards\u2014apply direct to-firms, and apply-via-NUS. These are firms requiring\n5 or less and more than 5 students\nrespectively, though no indication\nof this is given. In applying via\nNUS, several forms have to be\nfilled, and 7/6 is extracted \"to\ncover administrative expenses\"\nwhile told that one can only get\nthe job through NUS (they have\neven claimed a monopoly of GPO\njobs). Their administrative costs\nwould, of course, be less if they\nhad fewer cards and forms; be-sides, rarely does an employment\nagency charge the employees\nrather than the employers.\nOf the other so-called \" advantages \" of joining NUS, debating\ncompetitions, drama festivals, and\nnewspaper competitions could all\nbe arranged informally between\ncolleges and universities without\nemploying full time administrators at NUS.\nRISING COSTS\nThe present rate of joining\nNUS is Is. 3d. per member. In\naddition, the College NUS Secretary can charge for the card\nbefore handing it over to the\notherwise paid-up member\u2014\nmany colleges charge up to 3d. more to help balance accounts for\nsend in ng two or more people to\ncouncil. The rate is going up to\n2s.6d. in 1967, and it is already\ndecided to raise it by 2s.6d. instalments to at least 10/- in the\nnear future. If I.C. were 4,000\nstrong then, we would incur\n\u00a32,000 p.a. plus council delegates'\nexpenses, and expenses for anything one actually did\u2014such as\ntaking part in drama festivals.\nThe present \u00a3300 may look a small amount to waste at the\nmoment, and a small percentage\nof ICU's \u00a316,000, but should we\nwaste 2 per cent of our present\nincome, and mortgage 10 per cent\nof future income?\nPARKINSON'S DISEASE\nThe unfortunate thing about\nNUS is that it is a formal link\nrequiring paid administrative\nstaff, who outlive the executive\ncouncil just as the Civil Service\noutlives successive Governments,\nand it is in just the same pre dic a ment. Readers familiar with C. Northcote Parkinson will recognise the situation: the size of\nadministration increases at a steady rate irrespective of the\nincrease in work (if any) to be\ndone and the cost goes up slightly\nmore than proportionately as the\nrelative number of supervisors\nincreases.\nNUS appears to offer nothing\nthat could not be obtained at\nfar less expense, and with less\nbureaucracy, by I.C. Union alone.\nFinally, I think that the statement that the Ministry of Pensions was forced by the NUS\nto reverse the decision to charge\nPG's Class 2 rate N.I. is untrue,\nand anyway quite irrelevant\nto IC's joining NUS. However,\nhad the MNIP charged the\nclass 2 rate, this would have led\nto an immediate 10 per cent rise\nin PGs' cost of living, which the\nDSIR could not possibly have\noverlooked, and the result would\nprobably have been that grants\nwould have risen to cover the\nN.I., and then we wouldn't have\nNUS trying to get the MNIP to\ncredit the contributions. Anyway, I.C. has also been campaigning to this end, and I'm sure the effect of IC is greater\nthan 1 per cent, of NUS's effort.\n(I.C.3,000 students, NUS 250,000\nstudents).\nWe can hardly hope to reform\nNUS from its extravagant and\npetty ways, and so I think we are\nbetter out of it. It is rather a shame in that I like the idea of\nunity of students; but the cost is\ntoo great, and the unity too small.\nBRIGHTON INSURANCE BROKERS (Gould & Cook) Ltd.\n5 DURR EDER LA GOULD& COOK LTD GENERAL INSURANCE\nWe are sympathetic to your insurance needs and make it our business to get better terms for students.\nProbably, the most important type of insurance to you is Motor and you may have experienced difficulty in\nobtaining favourable terms for this class of insurance.\nWe have connections with several well established Insurance Companies where we will be able to insure\nyour Car or Motor Cycle at a competitive premium. Even if you are already insured, allow us to obtain a comparative quotation for you.\nOther types of policies which will be of interest to you are Personal Accident and All Risks insurance. A policy has been specially prepared to provide cash benefits for students who sustain injury during sporting act i ties as well as everyday life. Most hazardous sports are included such as Boxing, Mountaineering, etc., and the\npremiums required are extremely reasonable.\nFDR STUDENTS' LIFE ASSURANCE\nWhilst at College the type of Life Assurance which interests the student\nmost is the Student Policy. It is cheap, practical, and has tremendous advantages\nfor different uses\u2014for example, House Purchase, Regular Savings. It may also\nbe used as security for a loan if required. The policy costs you between 7/- to\n9/- a week, and give you a sum assured as high as \u00a32,000.\nSTUDENTS! GOULD & COOK, LTD., 11, RICHMOND PLACE, BRIGHTON,\nSUSSEX. TEL. BRIGHTON 680826.\n\n"
