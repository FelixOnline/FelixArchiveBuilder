    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS Murderdolls\nJoe Parker Fire! Brimstone! Small girls tormenting old men with wasps and\nhoney... this is the world of\nSlipknot, the self-styled 'death\nmetal' band hated by mums and\naped by kids the world over. So\nwhen 'Joey Jordison, Slipknot\nDrummer' drops a CD in the\noffice (ok, his PR company),\nlabelled 'Murderdolls - Side\nProject', we got out the salt and\njoss sticks and prepared for Satan\nhimself to pop out of the speak-ers.\nWe were pretty surprised, then,\nwhen the album turned out to be\nafer rally energetic rama lama sounding affair, with more in\ncommon with The Munsters than\nChucky. It's upbeat, go thy and\npunk y all in one massive tongue-in-cheek sweep, and quite possibly one of the most infectious\nrecords of the year. Surprise\nturned to delight when we read\nthe small print at the bottom of\nthe release, offering an interview.\nWe rushed down to the plush KWest hotel in Richmond to find\nout what had gone wrong in\nShock City.\nInside the light, airy forum of\nthe hotel, one entire end of the\nroom is taken up with photographers' paraphernalia. Several\npeople scurry around, and waiters and a concierge fuss round a table in the centre of the room,\nwhere two serious-looking blok es are sitting and drinking cocktails\n(it's a little after two in the after-noon.) Striding up, I announce\nFelix's arrival in my best throaty\njour no tones. The men look up\nblankly. I try again, explaining\nthat we're here to interview\nInterview\n27th August 2002\nMurderdolls, you know, the\nSlipknot side-project...\n\"Oh,\" exclaims the chap, in a very British accent, \"Do you\nmean the band? I think that's them, over there.\"\nLooking over, a small group of\nguys, dressed in rock-goth-punk\nattire lounge in one corner of the\nroom, laughing and drinking Diet\nCokes (mostly). Ah, I think.\nIt turns out Joey has to dash to\nsee a friend (\"this old hippy; my\nold man's man\" - probably bull-shit, too bad.) So instead I'm introduced to a Rock Guitarist. I know he's a Rock Guitarist,\nbecause a) he looks the part - all\ndye and piercings and big rings,\nb) he's called 'AC (no, really) and\nc) he has a handshake like a steel\npress.\nAC joined the group a few\nmonths ago, when Tripp Eisen\n(Static X), who also played in the\ngroup, had to leave. So after feebly a polo gi sing for mistaking two\ninvestment bankers for the rock\nband (oh, and carting in a tape\nrecorder the size of a TV - but\nthat's another story), I put it to\nhim, jokingly of course, that he\nmay not be a 'real' band member,\nafter all.\n\"No way!\" he exclaims, \"It\nwasn't that difficult. Wednesday\n[13]'s only been in since March.\nWe have a lotta fun in this group\n- everybody's new - and we kinda\nhad ara port already, you know?\n\"We went to the Summer Sonic\nfestival, in Japan? It was cool,\nthough we just hung out in the\nhotel a lot of the time. Meeting\nthe Hanoi Rocks guys was\ncool...\"\nJesus, I think, it's like bloody\nSpinal Tap USA. But in fact, AC\nturns out to be a friendly, witty\nand interesting interviewee. In\nparticular, there's none of the\ncynicism or stench of self-importance than usually hangs 'round\nUK acts. Refreshing. Still, not\nquite the hotel trashing, bone-smoking, groupie sod dom ising monster I'd expected. So what's going on? Where's the integrity,\nman?\n\"I joined this group because\nthat's what I wanted to do for\nfun,\" he declares earnestly, \"This\nis a big risk - there's none of the\nstuff that goes on with promoting\nother bands - so if we were concerned about getting our mansions and cars, or whatever, this\nis the last place we'd be.\"\nStill, I suggest, with the\n'Slipknot side-project' tag\ninevitably attached, they won't exactly lose money...\n\"Yeah, I guess so. So I suppose\nit's like, $l million with integrity\nversus $4million of dirty money!\"\nHe laughs.\nHmm. So how have the 14-year-old hood ie posse taken to\nthe show, I wonder?\n\"Well, at first the audience is\nkinda like a deer in the head-lights. But by the second half,\nthey're feeding off Murderdolls'\nspecial energy, our abrasiveness,\ntoo, and... it's fun! That's the\nmain thing. It's like going to a strip bar compared to a boxing\nmatch.\"\nAnd those, erm, odd lyrics, half\nYoung Frankenstein, half Jerry\nSpringer?\n\"It's all on the fun side - horror\nmovies, stuff like that.\" He pau s es. \"It's not based on... personal\nexperience.\"\nThey're clearly an ambitious\nbunch - or just optimistic - happy\nto daydream about awards and\nalbums to come when we bring it\nup, plus collaborations with Alice\nCooper (\"Hey, he's Alice, you\nknow!\") But will the record-buy-ing public take to tongue-in-cheek goth-rock? Hell, do they\neven know what it is?\n\"It's like Kiss. They had a stupid idea, people laughed - but\nthey did believe in what they\nwere doing, in a way, and they're\nstill around today!\"\nThe interview ends - AC wants\nto go shopping and ride a London\nBus.\nIn The Shadow Of The Valley\nOf The Murderdolls is out in the\nshops now on Roadrunner\nRecords.\nReading\nReview\nContinued from Page 22\n(believe me). We love it though.\nTop marks for punk-with-a point go to NOFX, who manage\nto be drunk, funny, dumb and\nintelligent all at the same time.\nAnd poke blunt but 'incisive' fun\nat Dubbya, too ('Idiot Son Of An\nAsshole'.) Oh well, it's still funny,\nand they've got us roaring.\nSheer nerve pulls The Hives\nthough a set w racked by sound\nproblems. \"You wanna know\nwhat we both have in common?\"\nbawls the Swede, \"We both love\nme!\" Damn right!\nAudience participation is\nalways fun, but The Strokes go\none further, NYC-style, as\n50,000 people sing 'Happy\nBirthday' to a hapless ly drunk\nJulian Casablancas. Factor in\nJack White, Rob Pollack (Guided\nBy Voices) and electric new tunes\nand you've got it: the perfect\nheadline set.\nJoe Parkerl\nCalling all rock fans\nAll you have to do to see the\ngreat man in action, the great\nman who is Cooper is to win a pair of tickets to the Alice\nCooper gig in Wembley on\nNovember the 16th, or a copy\nof his most recent DRAGONTOWN album, is answer\nthe question below and email\nyour answer to me at\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk before\nWednesday the 10th of\nOctober.\nWhich Alice Cooper song was\ncovered more recently by\nDaphne and Celeste?\na)b)0 School's Out\nBrutal Planet\nGimme\nGood Luck!\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "IV \u00bb\nFELIX MUSIC REVIEWS215/5 Ash\nIntergalactic Sonic7\"s For a band whose average age is\nstill a relatively young 25, it's a massive compliment to Ash and\ntheir understated ability to write\nkiller pop songs using nothing\nmore than guitar, bass and\ndrums that they have decided to\nrelease Intergalactic Sonic 7\"s, a definitive collection of the\nband's singles to date.\nIt's been ten years since Tim\nWheeler, Mark Hamilton and\nRick McMurray first played their\ninaugural London show to a sceptical audience still bewildered by the grunge fallout and\nunaware of the massive impact\nBritpop was set to cause over\nthe ensuing twelve months.\nPogo-sticks a go-go, let's jump up and down to welcome\nback the precocious songsters\non a break from recording their\nfifth album. Burn Baby Burn is\nfabulous, and is welcoming ly faded into the current single: the\nexcellent, yet thrash y, Envy.\nNew songs fit alongside old\nsongs seamless ly, as we find the\nsongs are grouped musically, i.e. fast and slow together, rather\nthan chronologically. We have\ntheir first big hit Girl from Mars\nnext to their comeback to the big\ntime, infectiously simple\nShining Light. Their most\nfamous soundtrack offering, A Life Less Ordinary,\nold favourite, the\nshimmer of\nExcellent stuff.\nWhilst some of the early singles {Petrol and Uncle Pat) can\nbe dismissed as nervous, fey\nindie warbling s, the likes of Jack\nNames The Planets and Kung\nFu provided strong hints at what\nthe band were capable of\nachieving, and by the time their\ndebut album 1977 was\nreleased, they'd already chalked\nup three top ten hits (Girl From\nMars, Angel Interceptor and Oh\nYeah).\nAs most of their Britpop peers\nhave crashed and burned, this\ncompilation hits it home that\nAsh have only just begun to get\ninto their stride.\nnext to an\nquiet, loud\nGoldfinger.\nCOMPETITION TIME\nIf you fancy getting your hands\non a copy of Coldplay's brand\nspanking new album, then\nhere's your chance.\nColdplay's first album was:-a) Aeroplanes\nb) Parachutes\nPlease email your answer, with\nyour name, year and department to music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nby Thursday 10th of October.\nEditor's Corner\nWelcome to another year of great music, reviews\nand interviews in the music pages, not to mention\nthe infliction of my nonsensical rambling upon you!\nAs before, we'll be concentrating on a variety of\nmusic we feel will be popular amongst the student\npopulation, with the aim of catering to as wide a variety of musical tastes possible. We'll bring you\nalbum reviews, singles reviews and live reviews,\nnot to mention exclusive interviews (Felix has\ninterviewed Beverley Knight, A and King Adora\namongst other great acts in the past). Stolen concept from last year's Felix, (sorry David) I 'll be running a competition every week if possible, allowing\nyou to have a chance at CD's, concert tickets and\nother random merchandise that the record companies decide to send me.\nThis week's issue includes the Reading Round\nUp and Murderdolls interview, courtesy of Joe\nParker of IC Radio, an 'Out This Week' section and\ncompetition for the new Coldplay album.\nThe Garbage picture, of course, is there, not\nbecause we're reviewing the ten millionth single off\ntheir year-old album, but because they look cool.\nYour comments, questions and opinions are always\nwelcome - just send an email to music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSingles\nOoberman - Beany Bean\nShiny, happy, and pointless\nI don't know where to start. This\nsingle comes across as a swirl of\nat in o happy jan gly guitars and\nshifting beats, with interludes\nfrom a choir of girls, and a guy\nstrongly reminiscent of the\nStreets. It's mad, it's a rush, but\nwith its jazzy background of\nbrass not unknown to Madness,\nand its undecipherable lyrics, I don't know what to feel - it's not\na definite like for me, that's for\nsure.\nRating - 2/5\nJames Yorkston and The\nAthletes - Tender to the Blues\nEP\nThe wavefront of artistic, nu-acoustic groups seems to expand\nprofusely every week, and this\ngroup, which uses their great\npride in their deployment of\norchestral instruments as their\nselling point, is no exception.\nInterested? Bet you aren't.I was-n't, but I found myself drawn in\nby the power of the music. Is it\nnot a drain to listen to? No. A hard-core pop a holi c such as\n(who incidentally possesses the\nattention span of a goldfish drop-ping), was thoroughly charmed\nby the title track, Tender to the\nBlues, a story of past love, and\ningenuity shown in 6:30 Is Way\nToo Early, the use of medieval\nsounds strikingly effective.\nChilled out to the max, it has the\neffect of a meditation tape, without being boring or bland. You\nactually want to know what he\nwants to say, unlike most sleepy\nnu-acoustic acts, who seem to\nspend more time working out\nhow to pare down, what is\nalready pared down. Hare's on\nthe mountain/Old maid, a folksy,\nbanjo-led take on a traditional, is\nthe second highlight, inventive\nslow, yet compellingly listenable.\nRating - 4/5\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

Stephen Fry has\nclearly loved writing The Hippopotamus and\nmakes it very easy to love reading it.\nTed Wallace, the main character, hates the\nworld - and the world hates him. He doesn't mind this, in fact he quite likes it this way. So\nlong as he can get his hands on a good bottle of\nwhisky and people leave him alone, he is happy.\nTed used to work as a theatre critic for a newspaper but after being a little too critical one particular evening he was, unceremoniously, given\nthe sack, given the number of a local rehabilitation clinic and told to sod off. It is in this state of\nbereavement for his social and financial loss that\nhe is approached by a long lost goddaughter and\noffered a lot of money to stay with some rich\nfriends of his and get free alcohol. Strangely\nenough Ted accepts and sets off; the only problem is, he is under strict orders to look for something but Jane, his goddaughter, would not tell\nhim what. From this point on, our embittered\nprotagonist is spun into a world of mystical healing that really is too much for poor old Ted to\ncope with. His rich friends have the appearance\nof the perfect family, but slowly it becomes obvious that something is being hidden and it is this\nsecret that Jane expects Ted to discover.\nFry has a wicked, twisted sense of humour and\nThe Hippopotamus provides laugh-out-loud\nquips with a vicious, sexual streak. The internal\nworkings of Ted Wallace's mind are really hilari-o us, made more so by the bizarre situation in\nwhich he finds himself. Definitely worth a read.\nThe Hippopotamus, by Stephen Fry, is published\nby Arrow and recommended for sale at \u00a35.99.\nISBN 0-09-918961-5\nntt fy(\\, peeks\nContact publishers, get free books!\nTraining in editing and layout\nprovided\nE mail felix@ic.ac.uk\nWasted, by Mikki Goffin\nMikki Goffin has made a brilliant debut with this one, a touching and moving account of the true love and support that exists within a family and the\nstress and devastation caused by a disease such as schizophrenia. This is\nnot a story without humour and Goffin portrays a student's life with an\naccuracy and wit that provides a much needed relief from the intensity of\nthe effects of such a dramatic illness.\nAbigail is the main character whose life is detailed through her late teens\nto early twenties. Abi admires and adores her older sister, Jasmine, who is\na heroin addict and a schizophrenic and Goffin explores the effects of this\non her family.\nAs Abigail tries to continue her life and begins the difficult move from\nschool to university, Jasmine slowly slips away into a murky life of drugs\nand madness. Goffin never tries to explain the causes of schizophrenia, but\nhe does emphasise the confusion that surrounds the disease - doctors\nhave differing opinions and nobody understands why it happens to particular people. \"I 've read every bloody book in the world about sch iz oph re nia... I don't even know what it is, what it's supposed to stand for.\" The\npain of this confusion and the misunderstandings for the family is evident\nthroughout the novel. When Abigail leaves for university Jasmine loses her\nonly contact with the real world, and Abi loses the constant reminder of\nthe effects of drugs. Both of them lose their best friend.\nDespite the seriousness of the subject matter Goffin manages to maintain a sense of humour with a humorous account of university life. Abi\narrives at university and meets her flat mates in halls of residence, then,\nas she struggles to keep on top of her reading and coursework she gets\ninvolved with too many men and too much pot, leading to more chuckles.\nI eagerly await Goffin's next novel. If this one is anything to go by, he\nshows great promise as an emotive, tender writer who can tackle important issues whilst maintaining a tactful sense of humour. Jenny\nWasted, by Mikki Goffin is published by Phoenix for \u00a36.99.\nISBN 0-75381-434-X books.felix@ic.ac.uk To review the latest literature, e mail Pages at this address\n\n"

While it may be Friday for\nyou lot, for me (due to the magic\nof printing deadlines) it is still\nTuesday evening, so the Freshers\nFair is still hot in my mind. Firstly\nI would like to say thank you to Al\n(for the second week in a row) for\nhis help today, and second I would like to say thanks to everyone who showed an interest in\nFelix: you should have received emails by now, and for anyone that\nhasn't, or for anyone that didn't manage to find us and get their\nnames down, please e mail me so\nthat I can contact you next week\nsome time.\nWhile on the subject of Freshers\nFair, I have had several arguments\ntoday with several clever-clogs es( if that's a plural) on the subject of\napostrophes. Now, just to put the\nrecord straight, I realise that if it is\nthe Week/Fair of Freshers, then\nyes, there is an apostrophe:\nFreshers' Fair. However, Felix (i.e. me) believes that it is a week that\nconsists of Freshers, as in AIDS\nWeek, or Fish Week. None of\nwhich have them. So don't write\nany bloody letters complaining\nbasically.\nAnyway, I'm in the middle of\nsending out the e mails, but\ntonight is deadline night, so you\ncan imagine my joy and rapture at\nconsidering the heady time at\nwhich I will get to rest my head.\nActually, to be honest, it's only\nlam, and I think we should be finished by 2. Banter! As they say.\nBut if you lot were helping, then I would have been home and asleep\nby now, so get over here now. Not\nthat you can right now, obviously,\nbut you see my point.\nHmmm. Kind of run out of\nthings to say, actually. This sometimes happens at this time of\nnight, I'm afraid, but you'll get\nused to it if you ever read this on\na regular basis. In fact, so lazy and\ntired am I feeling, that I'm going to\ngive this up for a bad job, and say\nsee you next week instead.\nI 've just noticed that this leaves\nme with rather a large empty\nspace left to fill, so now I'm going\nto scare you all with a huge picture of me looking cheeky, or so\nmy mother would claim.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX Ferry, Chunnel\nWe did it! These are the three\nwords that I have been waiting a long time to write and there were\ntimes along the 22.5miles that I doubted I would ever get to put\nthem down. It took us 14hrs16 min to get from Dover to\nSangatte (and no we didn't bring\nback any refugees). Our course\nwas far from simple as the tide\nsent us in anything but a straight\nline. However, we kept swimming\nin roughly the right direction until\nwe made it, exhausted.\nFor those of you who haven't read my previous articles the\nprinciple of the relay channel\nswim is to get from England to\nFrance with a team of 6 swim-mers, unaided (no wet suits or\narmbands), while following a little fishing boat. Each swimmer\ncompletes an hour and then tags\nthe next swimmer and this continues until dry land is reached.\nThe IC Cross Channel Swim Team\nconsisted of: Crazy Fish (Emma\nWilliams c pt), Fast Fish (Rebecca\nHerbert), Jelly Fish (Jessica\nTaylor), Dr. Fish (Caroline Coats),\nWelsh Fish (Emma Loyd Davis)\nand Boy Fish (me). We were well\nsupported by our reserve Rescue\nFish (Catherine Lawrence) and\nHotChocolate Fish (Rosie\nHerbert) without whom the trip\nwould have been almost imp ossi ble. The names which each of us\nwore with pride on our hoo dies were inspired by a certain team\nmember's unorthodox ability to\ncatch JellyFish and we thought\nwe would keep the fish theme\ngoing. Special thanks must go to\nCoachFish (Nick Adams) without\nwhose advice, encouragement\nand poor sense of humour we\nwould never had made it.\nThe day of the swim started\nwith a2:15 am wake up call. After\nmeeting up in Putney we set off\nfor Dover. Arriving at the marina\njust after 5:30am we loaded the\nessentials onto the boat - lots of\nchocolate and crisps, a stereo\nand some beer for after the swim\n(I think I bought slightly too\nmuch beer). Having had team\nphotos taken we dropped\nFastFish onto the beach at 6:30\nand the stopwatch started. She\nlived up to her name and completed 2 and a quarter miles. It\nwas a hot day even at this ungodly time in the morning and the\nsea temperature was almost tropical being 18\u00b0C most of the way\n(compared to what we had\ntrained in this was boiling). The\nrest of us took our turn and we\nreached half way with a projected time of around lO hrs. Unfortunately the change of tide\ntook its toll and all the stamina\nbuilt up from two-hour training\nswims in Dover started to pay off.\nWe all coped with the boredom of\nswimming for an hour non-stop,\nhowever no amount of training\ncould have prepared us for being\non that damned boat for so long.\nThe small boat was bobbing\nalong at the same speed as the\nswimmer; it hit every peak and\ntrough and it danced around in\nthe wash from almost every other\nboat in the channel. To be honest\nI think that most of us found the\nswimming part a bit of relief from\nthe constant seasickness. Poor\nCrazyFish suffered more than\nmost and having become\nChunderFish after her first swim\nshe was very brave to get back in\nfor a second. Many of us were\ndreading the thought of the\nschools of jellyfish that we would\ninevitably encounter. It was\nWelshFish who bore the brunt of\nthe little pink critters. She swam\nthrough them with the minimum\nof fuss and appeared not to even\nnotice the stings as she emerged\nback onto the boat. I on the other\nhand managed to hit a floating\nplastic bag and thinking it was a jellyfish jumped nearly 10ft in\nthe air; the Welsh are a tough\nbreed!\nAs darkness drew in the coast\nof France started to become vis i ble; the finish was in site!\nUnfortunately the tides again\nplayed their part in making the\ncrossing a difficult one as we\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\nFELIX FEATURE07... Or Swim?\nstarted to be pushed towards\nCalais. It became a race to get to\nthe shallow water, where we\ncould fight the tide and were safe\nfrom the incessant bombardment\nof the ferries. At this point there\nwas a real possibility of the swim\nbeing abandoned due to the dangers of the shipping lane, the\nencroaching shipwrecks and the\nrapidly setting in darkness. Being\non the boat started to get even\nmore testing as we encountered\nmore and more wash and for the\none in the water each hour\nbecame a sprint. As the tides\ngrew stronger we made less\nheadway towards the coast and\ndrifted ever closer to Calais. It\nsoon became clear that the first\nthree swimmers would be called\nupon for a third time. FastFish,\nDrFish and JellyFish would have\nto do the business if we were to\nmake the day worthwhile. They\ndid not disappoint, despite the\nwind picking up and the air temperature dropping. As DrFish\nentered the water it had become\ntoo dark to see her properly so\nthe green glow sticks were\nattached and off she went. As\nshe got out it was pitch black but\nthe shore was less than a mile off\nand we were in shallow water.\nWe knew that we had done it but\nit took JellyFish to set off on a dash for land.\nThe unpredictable nature of the\njourney did not stop there, as we\nnegotiated our way past the ship\nwrecks just off of the coast. The\ndinghy that JellyFish was to follow to the shore wouldn't start.\nUnperturbed JellyFish just kept\ngoing being guided by the reflection of the moon on the water\n(romantic it wasn't). With the\nwave of a glow stick we could see\nshe had made dry land. All of us\nwere now officially channel\nswimmers and we joined a list\nheaded by Captain Webb who\nfirst swam the Channel in 22hrs back in 1875. JellyFish sped\nback to the boat in the dingy,\nwhich had now decided to work,\nand was greeted to the sound of\nQueen's \"We are the Champions.\"\nWe may not have been the fastest\nteam to ever cross the channel\nbut we were all determined and\nthis is the most basic element of\nchannel swimming. Having had a beer each (this was the most any\nof us could stomach) we set sail\nfor England.\nThe journey home was relatively uneventful and much\nsmoother. The boat cruised\nthrough the water and it took\nabout three and a half-hours to\nget back. During this time a bit of\ncramped sleeping was grabbed\nbefore we headed back to\nLondon. As I passed through\nWimbledon on the way back to\nmy bed at 2:30amI saw some\nfriends which I had seen being\nthrown out of the same club\n24hours previously. The day\nbefore they had told me that we\nwere all mad, probably true but\neveryone on that boat managed\nto achieve something that six\nmonths earlier we would have\nlaughed at the thought of! The\nbets are on as to who will be\ncrazy enough to go for a solo. I know who my money is on!\nI would like to end by thanking\neveryone who has supported the\nswim especially the Harlington\nTrust who put a substantial sum\ntowards the cost of the boat, the\nMDU who contributed towards\nthe cost of the team outfits and\nall those who have given money\nin sponsorship and at fund ra is ers. This money will all be given\nto the Paediatric Physiotherapy\nDepartment at Hammersmith\nHospital for the purpose of purchasing new equipment. My final\nthanks goes to my group of girls\nwho made the whole channel\nswimming experience, yes even\nthe Serpentine swims, enjoyable.\nIf you would like to donate\nsome money towards the swim or\njust find out more contact:\nmark.fleet@ic.ac.uk or\nemma.williams@ic.ac.uk\nmark\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "2 0 MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX SugaBabes\nAngels With Dirty Faces\nbums & Single\n4/5\nThis long-awaited return from\nLondon's finest girl group grabs\nyou right from the start. It's an\namalgamation of everything,\norchestra, electronica, RnB,\ndance and pop. They show you\nthe almost impossible, that Gary\nNuman's music, can be blended\nsuccessfully with Adina Howard's lyrics, and not sound compromised. This is 'Freak Like Me', the\nrelatively inaccessible first single.\nThe progression of electronica\nverses RnB, with an augmented\nbassline allows the downbeat\nverse to progress to the honeyed\nchorus in 'Blue', where we hear\nthe babes rapping for the first\ntime of many. The good times\nroll on with current single, the\ndance-pop good times of\nMotown's girl groups with mod-ern-day attitude convinces the\nlistener that these girls are no\nflash in the pan. 'Round,\nRound', is a pop gem, the first of\nmany on this impressively\naccomplished, self-written\nalbum.\n'Stronger', reminiscent of\nNeneh Cherry on a good day,\nshifts its way through a darkly\noptimistic verse, to a somewhat\ndisappointing same y, yet\nstrangely apt chorus. The middle eight is eerily copied and\npasted from Neneh's 'Woman'\nwhich, with it's sparse string\nquartet backing to crescendo,\nimproves the song dramatically.\nNo time is spared - the funk and\nbreathy sass of 'Supernatural'\nsquiggles its way with a pared-down rap that the Spice Girls\nwould have killed for! Even\nGarage gets a look in on the\ncomparatively weak title track,\nwhich along with 'Virgin, Virgin\nSexy' highlights the downside of\nthe album - lots of ident ik it tracks, where the girls attempt\nto sing unconvincingly about\nissues they seem to have been\nthrough.\nREVIEWERS REQUIRED\nNo experience necessary, and\nyou get to keep whatever you\nreview. Come to Felix in Beit\nQuad on Thursdays at 1.30pm Mercury Music Prize 2002\nVarious\n5/5\nFor the benefit of the ignorant, the\nfavoured track off each of the\nshortlisted albums for this prestigious prize is taken and stuck on\nthis compilation, which gives us\nan idea of what's supposedly hot,\nand what's supposedly not.\nMiss Dynamite's It Takes More,\nthat is socially-conscious, sophisticated pop to you and me, kicks\noff proceedings in it's rich, roots y groove, which entices the listener\nsmoothly into the Doves mega hit\nThere Goes The Fear, which\nagain, is very good. The elder\nstatesman of pop, David Bowie,\nmakes a timely appearance, with\nSlow Burn. Social con cio us ness seems to be the order of the day,\nand I'm itching to hear something\nless demanding of the listener.\nDon't get me wrong, Slow Burn\nBowie, and his trumpet and tambourine led pop is very well put\ntogether, but I'm now in the mood\nfor decadent fluff. And soulful,\nstrum-along fluff is what I am\ngiven, in the shape of Beverley\nKnight's hit, Shoulda Woulda\nCoulda. The compilers have got it\nright this time, and I 'll admit now,\nthat I want Beverley Knight to win\nthe prize. Intelligent, beautiful and\ntalented, having waited a long\ntime for her much deserved success, I can't think of a better winner from the list.\nRap hip-hop outfit, Roots\nManuva, bring a British Flavour to\nwhat essentially sounds like a melting pot of Warren G and\nSpooks. Their darkly infectious\nmelody is a perfect prelude to The\nCoral's psych a deli c, yet endearing\nindie rock. The other inclusions\nare:- The Electric Soft Parade, Guy\nBarker and his instrumental jazz\ncrew, the Streets with his perceptive observations, Irish folk ster Gemma Hayes, the useless cod-reggae of the Bees, and the equally useless yet talented pianist\nJoanna MacGregor. Thankfully,\nlast years winner, PJ Harvey, with\nthe excellent, emotive, This Is\nLove, shows us what a true winner\nis made of, as she closes what is\ndefinitely an excellent show.\nSingles\nSimian - Never Be Alone\nThe keyboard's range of functions (glockenspiel, layered\nchords and space noises) is put\nto good use on this optimistic\noffering from Matt Bellamy's vocal second coming. Angsty,\nforceful vocals, and, that keyboard aside, there isn't much\nmore to this prog-influenced\npiece of art. And in the humble\nopinion of the great unwashed\nmasses, modern art = wank,\nright?\nRating - 2/5\nU2 - Electrical Storm\nThe suggestion of William Orbit\non the radio edit braces me for\nPop part two - i.e. U2 trying to\ndo dance in an inimitable way.\nExpecting a rush of beats, I was\npleasantly surprised by Bono's ruggedly angelic vocals, and\nthe band's trademark contemplative guitar sound being\naccentuated more clearly than\nbefore, which is definitely a good thing and unfortunately,\nreduces my curiosity for the\nnew Orbit-produced Blur\nalbum. Done to the high standards generally expected of U2,\nit is unfortunate that the originality often associated with\nthem is sadly lacking.\nRating - 3/5\nTurin Brakes - Long Distance\nMercury Music Prize nominated\n|duo return with what they know\nto do best. The plaintive, old-fashioned strum-along s with\nush orchestral backing. Ollie's expressive vocals sit comfortably with his incisive lyrics, on\ntop of a perky piano part and a tambourine. Fortunately, the\nvocals set him apart from other\n|jazz-influenced combos, and\nsave him the shame (oh the\n(shame!) of sounding like\nToploader.\nRating - 3/5\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The Diau\ncave occupies a5m diameter passage with a large, gentle river\nflowing through it. This area of\ncave exposed another character to\nthe all-encompassing trip: big pas-sages, winding canyons, and now\ntubular river-passage. This cave\nhad it all. We progressed easily\nalong the tunnel, the water only\nknee-high, when we came across\na large chamber with a tent in the\ncorner. This area had been used\nas a base-camp by the original\ncave-explorers. They had explored\nthe cave from the bottom up, with\nthe high entrances only discovered\nby intensive searching. We had\nour feed of noodles and Mars bars\nbefore pressing on in the cascading passage. The deeper sections\nof cave had wire ropes strung\nacross the side. We clipped in and\neasily pulled ourselves over the\nwater. Jan and I zoomed off, being\neager to explore this fascinating\npassage. It was only after we waited 10 minutes for the others to\ncatch up that we realised there\nwere problems. Goaty's acetylene\nlight had failed early on, and he'd been using his electric back-up for\nmuch of the cave. That eventually\nran out, and he was now on his\nspare electric, which was dimming rapidly. I lent him my spare\nelectric - enough light to exit the\ncave, but not much more than\nthat. This had slowed him down\nconsiderably, so we decided to\nstick together so he could cave by\nour lights.\nThe water was getting deeper\nnow, with the strong current rushing past us. At one point we had a brief swim across a chamber, but\nwe were still going strong and a quick look at the map indicated\nthere wasn't far to go. Much\nencouraged, we stormed along the\npassage, leaving the river behind.\nWe clambered down ladders,\nshuffled along thin ledges, waded\nthrough waist-deep pools before a glint of daylight could be seen in\nthe distance. It was 9am and we\nwere back in the French country-side. I couldn't wait to strip off my\nwetsuit to bask in the sun once\nagain, and the others followed\nlikewise. Paul, from the previous\ngroup, was waiting with warm\ncroissants and fine French coffee.\nWe collapsed in the back of the\ncar and returned to the campsite\nwhere we quickly sorted the gear\nbefore falling into a deep sleep.\nThe excellent Sunday lunch of\nendless beef and lamb eaten in\nthe magical village of ThorensGlieres topped off an excellent end\nto an excellent year's caving.\nIf you want to experience the\ndelights of the subterranean\nworld, visit foreign countries and\nbe the first person to explore new\npassageways, the caving club is\nfor you. We run fresher s trips\nthroughout the first term - but\ndon't worry, they're not all as\nhard-core as the Diau trip.

What prices! What a selection! QED\nstands for Quality Electrical Direct and that is\nexactly what it is; every electrical appliance\nunder the sun is here and at very reasonable\nprices. Pick an appliance, any piece of domestic machinery and you should find it here,\nwhether it is a new fridge for your flat, a foot\nspa to relax after a hard night clubbing, a DJ\nturntable to annoy the neighbours or a floor\nshampoo polisher to please the landlord (or\nlady). Now I'm sure that lots of you lovely people have got to their nice new flats and found\nthat the washing machine isn't actually provided so trot along here and nab yourself a cheap new one.\nThe web site itself is not particularly flashy -a very simple layout means it is extremely easy\nto use, it is a functional website and there has\nbeen little attempt to try and glamor is e it. But\nwho cares, with prices like these, although the\npink and yellow tables with blue writing can\nbe a bit hard on the eyes. There is also a very\nuseful function using SMS. If you see something that you want in a high street store then\nyou text the manufacturer and model number\nto QED and within a minute they send back a quote. An excellent idea I think. Delivery is\nfree over \u00a3100 and is \u00a34.15 under, and your\norder is usually delivered within 3-5 working\ndays.\nAll in all, this is a good service and certainly worth checking out before you buy else-Well... it could be useful...\nHmmm. I never fail to be amazed at the information that is available on the internet, I realise that there are many, many areas of\nknowledge that are a complete mystery to me\nand I'm sure I'm not alone on that. As such I consider it my duty to inform you of websites\nthat will almost certainly contain facts that you\ndid not know and, to be honest, probably never\nwanted to. This week's input is the ability to\ndecode the barcode, you know this is something that you have been dying to learn and it\nwill certainly complete your life.\nThe most common version is the UPCA code\nwhich normally needs to be read with a laser\nbut, with patience, can be decoded by the\nhuman eye. There are twelve digits (I never\nknew that) and each is represented by a seven\nbit binary code. The first six digits tell you the\nmanufacturer, the next five identify the actual\nproduct, and the last one is a check digit.\nAnyway, follow the step by step guide provided\nhere and you could soon be employed by\nTescos as 'Till assistant', or not. What the use\nof being able to decode the barcode is I have\nyet to work out, please send ideas on a post-card.\nIgnoring the pure irrelevance of this site it is\nactually quite well produced, simple but effective and user-friendly, so if you ever want to\nknow anything about the barcode, you really\nshould get a life!

    "content": "^ \u00a7 ' &k4 SOCIETIES FELIX Beneath the Mountains Colm Carroll (pictured on\nthe bottom of the opposite page) describes\nImperial College Caving\nClub's weekend trip to\nsubterranean France.\nWe descended the cave at 5pm. It\nwas quite late in the day, but we\ncouldn't resist the temptation of a quick beer at the restaurant an\nhour back along the path. Our\nshocked fellow customers were\nglad to see the back of us - a posse of neoprene-clad cavers are\nnot who you want to meet on a peaceful Saturday afternoon's stroll in the amazing scenery of\nthe Haute Savoie. We had divided\ninto two groups of 5 for the\nlengthy through trip from the Tete\ndu Parmelan plateau to the FiI Mere\nvalley, 700 metres below. This\nlong anticipated expedition is\ndescribed as 'probably the best\ncaving through trip in France', and\nconsidering the French invented\ncaving, it was definitely something\nto look forward to.\nIt started, as all good ideas do,\nin the pub! We were all looking for\nan adventurous caving trip to do in\nthe Summer, so when Hugh suggested this 650m through trip we\nwere all for it. Flights were\nbooked, cars were hired - a trip\nwas born!\nTwo months later, Hugh, Jan,\nTim, Goaty and I relaxed in beautiful sunshine as the first group\ndescended the entrance shaft - an\n88m drop into the heart of the\nmountain. We decided to wait an\nhour to allow them to clear the\nfirst section of the cave before\nstarting the descent ourselves.\nAfter a typical English Summer, it\nwas great to have the warm sun\nbeating down on us, especially in\nsuch an inspiring limestone land-scape. Once our skin had turned a satisfying shade of lobster, it was\ntime to go. I pulled my wetsuit\nover my shoulders, lobbed the\nrope down the small entrance pot-hole, and down I went. This was\nmy first pull-through trip, and I was slightly nervous. A pull-through requires the cavers to pull\nthe ropes down behind them in\norder to use them on the next\nshaft. Once the first rope is down,\nthere's no way back up - in effect\nburning the boats. As Jan hauled\nthe rope to join us on the small\nledge I suddenly realised the only\nway out was 16 hours and over 5\nkm away. We were committed!\nDisaster struck nearly straight\naway. At the bottom of the 88m shaft, I leaned on the rope to pull\nit down, but nothing happened. I put all my weight on it - not a budge. Tim came over to help, but\neven under the combined weight\nof the two of us, it still wouldn't move. This was the situation we'd all been dreading; the rope was\nstuck. We had to get the rope\ndown, as it was needed further on\nin the cave, and there was no\nother way out. Tim volunteered to\nascend back up the rope to discover the problem. He quickly discovered that the descent rope and\nthe pull-down rope had managed\nto twist themselves around each\nother. Tim carefully untwisted\nthem, then kept them well apart\nas he descended again to the floor.\nI once again leaned on the rope, a slight movement, then it stuck\nagain, our hearts sank. But pulling\nharder it soon came free and the\n70m of rope toppled down on top\nof me.\nAnother series of smaller pitches led to the biggest shaft in the\ncave, an exhilarating 58m free\nhang dropping into a spectacularly fluted chamber. A small stream\nentered from a tiny passage on the\nleft, continuing onwards in a channel at the bottom of a large\ntunnel. We followed this in to a huge dry passage, coated everywhere with solid mud. The next\nsection of the cave was just like an\nadventure playground. We swung\non ropes above big drops,\nwhooped along enormous train-tunnel passageway, ducked under\nmassive waterfalls, and eventually\nended up in the mammoth Salle\ndes Rhomboedres. This chamber\nacts as a large collector for the\nthree high altitude entrances to\nthe Diau system. We could see\nwhere the shorter Bel Espoir\nentrance entered, but couldn't find\nthe way on to the bottom. Panic\nensued as we clambered all over\nthe colossal boulders in search of\nit. Would we be stuck to wander\nthe Diau system forever? A huge\nshout from Goaty led to relief by\nall as he found the route to the\nPuits des Echos, a large 39m shaft which did, indeed, echo.\nAfter a quick cup pa from the stove\ndeposited by the previous group,\nwe followed the water onwards.\nWe had now entered the\nAffluent de Grenoblois, a large\nstream way passage with glistening walls: the stone seemed to be\nreflecting our lights back at us.\nThe many small drops and waterfalls adding to the excitement in\nthe best bit of passage I 've ever\nseen. We sped onwards and\ndownward in this winding passage\n- with everyone enjoying the route.\nIt must have been past 3 in the\nmorning, but the cave was too fascinating for anyone to notice.\nA slowing and deepening of\nwater indicated that the confluence with the Diau stream way was fast approaching, and though\nfelix@ic.ac.uk Imperial College Caving Club\n\n"

The group have a reputation for\noccupying buildings and contacting the media\nto gain publicity for their cause.\nKeith Reynolds, Head of Security, Post and\nFire Services said that 35 security officers\nwere used in total, seven of whom were\nbrought in from external security companies\nand one of whom was drafted in from the\nUnion's stewarding team.\nJota.\nT Freshers Fair still a success\nAs expected, three groups of protesters converged on Imperial on Monday and while the\ngroups were of \"relative size\" according to Mr\nReynolds, they were successfully prevented\nfrom entering the College. There was no\nattempt to gain entry on Tuesday, but security remained tight just in case.\nNona Ahamat - the Union's Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and Societies - said she\nthought Tuesday's Freshers Fair was a great\nsuccess, despite the need for Freshers to\nqueue up for security checks at several points\nacross the campus. Several thousand students attended the event with over two hundred clubs attempting to attract new recruits.\nIn addition to animal rights protesters, a number of other uninvited guests appeared at\nthe Fair but stayed on the pavement rather\nthan attempting entry, including an Islamic\nfundamentalist group and the Socialist\nWorker.\n\u2022 Security are also checking CCTV footage to\ndetermine who stole goods from the Senior\nCommon Room during last year's Summer\nBall. Anybody with information should contact Security. AW\nLast Orders at the Crofton\nThe Crofton on Queen's Gate,\nfamous with students for years as\na late-night venue for post-Union\ndrinking, has closed this week.\nIn a 'Bedknobs and\nBroomsticks' moment, Felix\nreporters investigating the sad loss\nwere nearly struck by flying beds\nas the interior was gutted.\nThe front bar of the Hotel had\nbeen popular for years with students who weren't ready to go\nhome, even after Friday nights at\nthe Union with a lam licence.\nThe inflated prices and drab interior were obviously no discouragement - possibly due to the relative\ninebriation of the clientele.\nFelix spoke to Spencer Parsons,\nHotel Manager, who said that the\nclosure was not due to lack of\nbusiness. Instead, the family running the business had decided to\ntake the opportunity sell the property at a good price to Boston\nUniversity, concentrating instead\non other businesses.\nWill Dugdale, bar expert, proposed the theory that the large bar\nmight remain, while the rest of the\nbuilding is converted into a new\nstudent hall.

That's the\nBlazin' Squad for you, and that's enough of them for now, the less\nsaid the better. They're thankfully followed by the sweet, sassy,\nattitude packed tunes of the\nbluesy, rich vocals of Tweet, the\nimprobably beautiful Ashanti,\nwith the excellent Foolish and JLo. I'm Gonna be Alright is a definite highlight, with it's attitude packed delivery and rap\nfrom the 'Stillmatic' Nas.\nThe transition to what I don't like, i.e. mush, occurs rather\nabruptly, with Jaheim's Heaven\nin My Eyes, the strained and\nalmost perverted lyrics Feenin\nby the ever-ageing Jodeci making me reach out for the sick\nbucket. Graphic enough for you?\nWell to add insult to injury, add\nKeith Sweat's Twisted, another\nbland, insipid ballad, Levert\nSweat Gill's narcissistic Your\nBody and Wayne Marshall's Your\nG Spot with it's tacky imagery\nand calculated breathing exercises, just compounds my dread\nof listening to the rest of the CD.\nThankfully Craig David and\nDamage come to the rescue,\nwith the smooch y Rendezvous\nand the jazz-laden, smoky After\nthe Love Has Gone. Unknown\nAmericans, the White Head\nBrothers are also a welcome\naddition, with their groovy,\nslinky and sexy You're Love is a187. Take note Jodeci - This is\nhow a sexy RnB groove should\nbe done! Shola Ama and En\nVogue redeem CD1 with a much\nneeded touch of class with the\nfunky You're the One I Love and\nMotown-esque Supremes style\nGiving Him Something He Can\nFeel. This is indeed pop at its\nvery best, and puts me in a very\ngood mood for CD2.\nAnd the good mood carries on,\nwith the ground-breaking Missy\nElliot and the bhangra/hip-hop\nclubbing tune - Get UR Freak\nOn, this song being so good I don't want it to end! Brandy and\nFat Joe carry on the good work\nwith Full Moon and to top off a trio of top tunes, Adina\nHoward's funky, yet alluring\nFreak Like Me. If you think you\ndon't know it, yes you do! You\nknow this one, the tune where\nthe Sugababes stole the lyrics\nand put it over the Gary Numan\nsample to make their decidedly\ninferior cover! Again, the transition to the slow songs occurs,\nbut less rapidly so, but with\nequally perverted songs! I count\nGerald Levert, D 'Angelo,\nAnother Level and Mark\nMorrison among the guilty par-ties. Thankfully the worst is\nover. Highlights to close include\nNext's Too Close, Angie Stone's jazz and smoke in No More Rain\nand Sunshine Anderson's soulful\nLunch or Dinner.\nSo what the unashamed popa-holi c learn from this exercise?\nThat this CD is a useful summation of the recent past of RnB\nwith tracks dating back to\n1993. That with all genres of\nmusic, there's the good, the bad\nand the ugly....\nAnd you'll never guess what?\nTwelve bad tracks, versus t wen ty-six tolerable to excellent,\nmeans that I for one am definitely coming back for more. A convert is born!\nMatthew\nEverybody Down\n4/5\nEverybody Down explodes with\nthick guitar melodies and hooky\nalternative rock songs brimming\nwith youthful agitation, passion,\nand solid musicianship... wielding as much drama and emotion\nas three-minute plus modern pop\nsong can handle. That's the All\nMusic Guide's description of\nMatthew, and I have to agree\nwith them there on the title track:\na feel good, thought-provoking,\nintrospective sing along of the\nhighest order. The rest of the\nalbum carries on in the much\nsame order; high quality, learned\nmusicianship, the emotive vocals\ncarrying the questions asked\neffectively. Highlights include\nThis Time, In Your Car and Led\nZep's younger brother, Streams.\nThe lows? Well there are no lows,\nas this is one hot scorcher of a summer album!\nAll Reviews by Sajini Wijetilleka\nReading\nReview\nYer pays yer money and yer\ntakes your choice.\nMusically, festivals are about\ncrackling live performances\nfrom all your favourite bands,\nplus the chance to check the\nhype on the new boys.\nFinancially, it's the marketplace\nof the industry, where the labels\nget to show their wares - established acts and newcomers\njostling all year for position on\nthe bill, in pursuit of that all-important exposure. Careers are\nmade and broken at festivals, so\nbands have to shine or stink;\nthe only bad reaction is no re ac tion....\nShame Gomez haven't got the\nscript, then. The lard y stoner's band of choice look positively\nbored. And so do we. At their\nbest, Gomez can be magical,\nbut if I want to see a bunch of\nfat chemistry students halfheartedly floundering through\nrecycled blues riffs, I 'll go down\nthe union.\nOf course, a sure fire way to\ndraw attention is to smash, bite,\nthrow or spit on whatever you\ncan.

Slowly groups of people were\narriving and finding places to sit or were pulsing through the doorways and bar areas. And\nthen, when people seemed to be least expecting it, everything happened.\nMusic and light seem to take over and suddenly nothing is static. The circulation of people between the three dancefloor s builds until\neveryone has found their right place; choosing\neither Room 3's breaks, Room 2's furious\ntechno or Room l's upbeat tribal sounds.\nFor me the night all happened in Room 2. Its\nhot, hypnotic techno charmed the crowd into a rhythmical frenzy; green laser light curving\nthrough smoke and lapping the crowd before\nshattering into electric beams.\nBy 4am it was all too much, and I can't keep\nup the pace and have to leave - too stunned to\nspeak. Suddenly it is the end of the night and\nthere is only silence and rolling credits. Trust\nme, this one's awesome.\nRagbull\nSaturday @ Bridge & Tunnel\nJools Butterfield launches his \"Ragbull\" record\nlabel in fine style at his monthly Ragbull night.\nAt the Bridge & Tunnel you will typically find\nthat you are listening to DJs and acts that you\nwould expect to play only at bigger clubs - and\nthis Ragbull night is certainly no exception.\nThis Saturday Groove Armada make a special\nappearance with their percussionist Patrick\nDawes, but there are also plenty of other\nattractions, including Jools Butterfield himself.\nWhat you can assume is that everyone who\ndoes play will bring with them the sound of\nRagbull: a dirty, soul-peppered and Afroinfused sound. The emphasis is more on giving\nsome limelight to the best as yet undiscovered\nartists. You will be hearing the best of today's underground music.\nOne of the best things about the Bridge &\nTunnel as a venue is that, as there is no pressure to fill a dancefloor, the DJs actually seems\nto be enjoy themselves a lot more. You can just\ntell that what they play are just the records\nthat they want to play - which I think makes\nthe music just that little more personal and\ninteresting.

    "content": "FELIX UNION By Students, For Students\nToday will mark the end of the\nFreshers Week which is\nundoubtedly one of the busiest\nweeks of the year and firstly I would like to start by saying a personal thank you to all the\nstaff who have worked incredibly\nhard to support all the students\nespecially the fresher s.I hope you have enjoyed your\nfirst few days at Imperial. Most\nof you will have met a huge\nnumber of people, signed up for\nmany clubs and societies and\nstarted getting involved in all the\nactivities and services the Union\noffers. For those you haven't there will still be plenty of\nopportunities to do so over the\ncoming weeks. This year promises to be an exciting year and this\nweek I thought I would let you\nknow what the Union is doing\nand keep you updated on a couple of recent developments.\nVolunteering in the Community\n\"Volunteering in the\nCommunity\" is a new project\nstarted in conjunction with the\nCollege to encourage more students to participate in local\ncommunity. The full scheme will\nbe launched in January but\nthere are plenty of opportunities\nto get involved now. The\nImperial Dance Company will be\ntouring the local schools teaching modern and contemporary\ndance. Or why not try the\nCommunity Action Group which\noperates soup runs for the\nhomeless. There are more\nopportunities with the sports\nteams to teach local children or\nhelp teach in local schools. If\nyou are interested in these projects or want to start others,\nplease contact me.\nStudent Development\nStudents at Imperial have\naccess to some of the best\nteaching and research anywhere\nin the world. However, it is\nimportant to realise that there is\nmore to your development than\nyou degree or research. You will\nneed other skills, skills such as\ntime management, leadership -skills that will be of practical use\nfor your future careers. The\nUnion has embarked on a programme to develop skills work-shops. During the course of the\nautumn term you will hear of\nthese programmes so watch this\nspace for more.\nCome and run the Union\nAs I have mentioned in my\nprevious article the Union is an\norganisation run by students for\nstudents. Each year a number of\nofficers are elected to run and\nmanage the Union - but most\nimportantly these officers are\naccountable to you. You can\nhave a say on the conduct of the\nofficers, how the Union oper-at es, how we spend the millions\nwe receive and much more\nbesides.\nA good place to start is\nCouncil. Council is the governing\nbody of Union and responsible\nfor all aspects of the Union\nincluding multi-million pound\nbudgets. You can be a part of\nthat either by getting elected to\nit or simply turning up to find\nout what the Union is doing and\nhave your say.\nAn open door and a helping\nhand\nDuring the course of the year,\nsome of you may experience difficulties or feel anxious about\nyour course or simply be interested in finding out more about\nCollege and the Union.\nWhatever problems or ideas you\nmay have please remember my\ndoor is always open so feel free\nto come in and have a chat.\nSen Ganesh, President\ninternal 58061\npresident@ic.ac.uk\nUnion Council Meeting6 pm Monday 21st October 2002\nUnion Dining Hall\nStand for Elections as an Ordinary members of Council, Executive, Trading, Services, Retail and\nHouse Committee.
