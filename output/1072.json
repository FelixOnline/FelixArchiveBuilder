In addition\nto the tender document itself, the presentation incorporated a short speech\nby Mr Allsop and computer animations showing the proposed interior\nof the new bookstore, followed by a question and answer session.\nFour external companies are\nknown to have bid for the tender;\nhigh street bookstores Dillons and\nWaterstones, academic booksellers\nBlackwells and The Modern Book\nCompany, which currently runs a store for medical students near St\nMary's on Praed Street. Despite this\nstrong competition, Piers Williams\nwas in a buoyant mood as he spoke\nto Felix on Wednesday: \"I think it\ncomes down to the Union persuading\nthe College that we're a good risk...\nwe know what level of trade there's going to be, we've done our research\nvery carefully.\"\nThe Union's chief advantage over\nits competitors may be the benefit it\ncan bring to the College community\nby re-investing profits from a new\nbookstore into student services. The\nsurplus from the Union's current\nbookstore, situated on the Sherfield\nwalkway, is used to fund clubs and\nsocieties as well as new developments such as the refurbishment of\nthe Entertainments lounge in Beit\nQuad. Conversly, were the Union to\nlose the tender, these facilities might\nface funding cuts and future projects\nwould be under threat.\nA decision by the College is eagerly awaited by all those concerned.\nThe new bookstore is planned to be\nfully operational by Easter next year.\nClaim your right to vol inane raf Elect it ng in the form below, tearing it out^ turning it to the Felix The> then be. warded to the electoral registrars I want to claim my right to vote\nYou may regis t* addresses (for example, M ne and home);\nyou may only vote from one.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022fi, / te.;...t elK$ Permanent/Home address (if different):\nPost code:\nFish toxin eases prostates\n.Post dni Date of birth:\nI dec la|e that fie se details are correct and that I am a British, Irish, other\nComnSrWeetth or other EunMleftttMizen.\nPlease .\u00abif y cJ jj j jue a^ jj^^^n citizen but not British or Irish: \u2022\nSignature:. . 4... jj jj j> ate:\nMATTHEW BENNETT\nResearchers at Imperial College's Biology Department have developed\na new technique that could save\nthousands of men with prostate cancer the need for distressing and\npotentially fatal surgery with the\nunlikely discovery of an link with\npuffer fish.\nProstate cancer is caused by\ntumours in the prostate gland, but is\nonly lethal if the tumours start forming in other parts of the body. This\nhappens when the cancer cells\nbecome 'metastatic'. The difficulty\nin the past has always been differentiating between benign tumours and\nmalignant ones, which contain the\nmetastatic cells.\nThe team of researchers, working\nin collaboration with scientists from\nthe Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool and the University of\nLiverpool, found that by measure ing the ion currents flowing in a cell, it\nwas possible to distinguish between\nbenign and malignant cells. The\ntechnique is used normally in the\nstudy of nervous and muscle cells,\nwhich are highly electrically active.\nTo the researchers' surprise the\nmetastatic cells contained a current\nof sodium ions, something never\nbefore seen in cancer cells.\nThis means that men with prostate\ncancer could have tissue samples\ntested for the malignant tumours, to\nevaluate the future behaviour of a given tumour. There has, up to now,\nbeen no way of making such a prediction and hence deciding what\ntreatment should be administered.\nSurgery carries with it a high risk of\nincontinence, im potency and even\ndeath from infection.\nThe discovery of the sodium current promises a possible non-in va sive therapy with the use of a substance known as tetrodotoxin, or\npuffer fish poison. This poison has\nbeen known to block the action of\nsodium channels in the nervous system and the discovery of similar\nchannels in tumour o us cells lead to\nthe suggestion that it could be used to\ntreat cancer. Although the precise\naction of the sodium channels on the\ncells' ability to move around the\nbody is not known, preliminary studies suggest that the toxin suppresses\nthe cells' capacity to invade other tissues and form secondary tumours.\nNews in Brief\nJointly \u2022\u2022is iri Bit tl lt ve Society\nand Labour Club v vlc^ je Union WELLCOME FUNDS\nREMOVED?\nThe Dealing Committee's investigation into Higher Education is due to\ngive a report next summer regarding\ntertiary education in Britain and is at\nthe moment collecting reports from\nvarious educational funding organisations, including the various\nresearch councils and charitable\ntrusts.\nIn their report sent to Sir Ron\nDealing, the Wellcome Trust, a charitable organisation providing scientific research grants all over the\nworld, have argued that their grants\nshould not be used for the general\nrunning of public education establishments. The Wellcome Trust fund research\nat Imperial College and have threatened to move their UK sponsorship\nabroad if the Government imposes\noverheads for a cede mic research. In\nthe light of recent real-terms cuts in\nthe science budget, further loss of\nsupport could have a devastating\neffect on British scientific develop-ment. The Wellcome Trust and IC\nhave a long-standing relationship,\nbut should Wellcome carry out their\nthreat then this would be put into\njeopardy.\nDON'T FORGET YOUR\nLASER TOOTHBRUSH\nOne of the latest Imperial College\nresearch developments is a toothbrush which uses laser light and a special toothpaste with a light-sensitive chemical to kill mouth bacteria.\nResearch into a cancer treatment\ncalled photo dynamic therapy provided the inspiration for the break-through, which uses inactive chemicals that are switched on by light.\nThese chemicals react with oxygen\nto destroy bacterial cell membranes.\nDeveloped by Professor David\nPhillips and Ilya Eigenbrot of the\nChemistry Department the toothbrush will not be available for\nChristmas as the project is experiencing a slight technical hitch. To the\ndismay of all involved, a minor side\neffect of the toothpaste is that it turns\nthem a rather fetching shade of blue.\nFISHER HALL CHRISTMAS\nBALL A SUCCESS Fisher Hall's Christmas Ball last\nSaturday was a success and despite\nan outrageously expensive bar, all\nattending residents enjoyed the\nnight. The raffle in particular was\npopular, due to the kind donation of\na \u00a360 CD player by Richer Sounds,\nthe Kensington hi-fi shop.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER LETTERS & EDITORIAL 13\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nanswered by David Roberts\nThis letter was held over last week\nDear Editor,\nIn the past few episodes of Felix, I have read that there have been a few\nproblems with bicycle security.\nDuring the holidays, I had my fourth\noperation on my knee. Having\nsecured a flat in Fulham, I decided\nthat the best mode of transport was a bike. Both for the savings I would\nmake, as well as my doctor advising\nme it was a sensible idea.\nThree days after I started at col-leg e, my bike was stolen. Not unusual in London, but the circumstances\nare undeniably suspicious and lead\nme to believe that the people in\ncharge of College security are in fact\ncompletely incompetent.\nAt 4 o 'clock on a Friday afternoon\nI had left my bike chained to one of\nthe bicycle rails outside the main\nsecurity office in the Sherfield build-ing, By the time I returned at 6\no 'clock the bike had been taken from\nright under the noses of our hawk-eyed security officers, D lock in clu d ed. What I didn't notice when I was\nattaching the bike to the railing, was\nthat the railing had in fact been previously cut with what was believed\nto be a power saw.\nConsidering my close proximity to\nthe Security office, I decided to\nreport the theft. After writing down\nall the required details, I got chatting\nto the security officers on duty. They\ntold me of the previous seven bicycle\nthefts in four days and unless you\nspend around 100 pounds on a Dlock your bike may as well not be\nlocked up! I was then told that the\nsafest place to lock my bike is on the\nwalkway where there are cameras.\nAs far as I know, people are still\nattaching their bikes to the damaged\nrailing, but worst off all, there has\nbeen little or no advice by security as\nto the best way we should keep our\nbikes at College.\nAt this time [November 20th]I am\nwaiting to hear from the college after\nI requested a full reimbursement of\nthe cost of the bike.\nRobert Pawlowicz\nPhysics UG\nYou'll be the luckiest man alive if\nyou manage to get a penny out of\nthem. At the present time College\nauthorities seem to view the oh-so-evident in competency of Security\nas your problem, not theirs.\nPerhaps when some enterprising\nthe if steals the Rector's Mercedes\nfrom his doorstep, we might see\nthe situation change. (If there is\nanyone out there with the requisite\nbalaclava, crow-bar and black\nsack, don't be afraid to ask any\nmember of Security for directions\n- they'll probably even open the\ngate for you to drive the car away)\nDear Felix,\nI am about to finish a Ph.D. after\ncompleting a degree at Imperial.\nAlthough I have received LEA and\npostgraduate research grants, plus a number of access fund contributions,\nI have still run up a few debts (from\ntwo credits cards, student loans, and\nfour bank overdrafts) totalling jus-t under \u00a312000 (documentary evidence upon request). Can any of your\nreaders beat that?\nName and address supplied.\nGame on. Without espousing one-up man ship, can anyone beat that?\nLetters may be edited for length.The guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those of the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1073 is Wednesday 11th December.\nPlease bring some form of identification.\nLetters may be e mailed to our address: felix@ic.ac.uk\nA FELIX\nStudent Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nRecently, I was contacted by the\ninfamous advert is ng agency Saatchi\n& Saatchi with a view to booking a few pages for one of their clients. I was somewhat surprised to be rung\nup by an agency that usually puts its\ncollective mind round a campaign\nfor big, important clients like the\nTory party, rather than something\nthat would be well received in the\nstudent press. Nevertheless, the man\non the 'phone was seriously interested in obtaining enough details about\nour advertising procedure to book\nsome space if he should so want. He\nwas also being very cagey about\nrevealing who the advert was being\nbooked for. Before telling me, he\nasked if there were any editorial\nrestrictions on who could advertise.\nNaturally, I said no, the only strictures that we put on adverts are that\nthey be legally valid and not too\noffensive, with discretion reserved. I replied that we were all capitalists\nnow, with the undercurrent of 'no th ing is getting to get in the way of us\nand your cash'.\nIntrigued by all this intrigue, I finally got out of him that his client\nwas a large national graduate\nrecruiter that had been suffering from\nbad press over its equal opportunities\npolicy (I'm afraid that I cannot reveal\nwho it actually is - you will have to\nwait for the next issue). Knowing the\nanswer already, I asked why there\nhad been problems. He replied that\nmany students' unions had policies\nexpressly prohibiting dealings with\nhis client.\nThere was a similar case with the\nsummer mail out by the Union to new\nmembers of College. A contract with\nthe mail out suppliers explicitly said\nthat the Union was not allowed to\nobject to the companies in the\nmail out, and particular to a specific\nbank. No problem for us, as ICU has\nno such interdiction s, but for other\nstudents' unions there might be a conflict of interest. In today's rather\nharsh fiscal environment, principle\ncan often be sold down the river for\nfinancial rewards. But with the\ndemand on the services provided by\nunions increasing, and students'\nexpectations greater than ever before\ncan the managers of unions (and\nclubs like Felix) afford not to take\nthese straightforward offers of additional income?\nPrinciple can also come into conflict with good business sense. This\nis amply demonstrated by the problems NUS Services Ltd, the service\narm of the NUS, have had with the\nNUS campaign against Pepsi.\nNUSSL have signed a deal with\nPepsi giving low prices to students,\nbut the NUS has a standing policy\nnot to deal with the company.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "6 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER t pop and Oasis, Blur and Pulp are all avid members of the Labour\nParty. It's official! Being a left winger is suddenly, terribly,\ntrendy again .\nDuring the 60s London was known as the coolest city in\nthe world - we had The Rolling Stones, The Who and\nTwiggy whilst the jazz heads had Ronnie Scott's. For\neveryone, especially students, it was the 'ultimate' to be a left winger( even for undergraduates Michaels Portillo and\nParkinson). Posters of Fidel Castro, Angela Davies and\nBob Dylan adorned the walls of student digs across the\ncountry. On top of this, the Beatles showed their affiliation\nwith Labour by posing in a set of photoshoot s with Prime\nMinister Harold Wilson.\nNow London is experiencing a resurgence of these\nvibes with Newsweek re ordaining London as the \"coolest\"\ncity in the world. Our 90s equivalents to the sixties pop\npoliticans are Portishead, Massive Attack and Bjork.\nToday the jazz heads worship at \"The Blue Note\" and, at\nthe Brit Awards Oasis happily praise Tony Blair and New\nLabour for giving hope to young people.\nCynics may say that Oasis are simply mimicking the\nBeatles in political as well as musical styles. Non-cynics,\nnamely Labour supporters, will state that it's simply about\nNew Labour's hard-hitting policies. Regardless of opinion\nit is rather symbolic that the Mancunian band should\nchoose to support Labour. Oasis are currently revelling in\nthe full-blown joys of greedy capitalism. Although there is\none historical hitch in Oasis becoming fully fledged blue-rinsed Conservatives - Oasis are working class\nNortherners.\nA voter's class, education and line of work seem to be\ncrucial denominators in determining the party that he or\nshe supports. In fact the political party that a person\nendorses has become a lifestyle affirmation.\nTraditional Labour supporters tended to be either champagne soca lists or trades union blue-collar workers. The\nchampagne socialists included radical intellectual thinkers,\nwriters and artists, as well as theatre-land luv vies( gene r ally people who rebelled against convention).\nThe business world has always leaned towards the\nConservatives, due to sy pathetic money-making policies.\nOther traditional Conservatives include the staid and\nupstanding civil-servants and middle managers.\nThe sixties saw the more liberated atmosphere spurring\nthe begining s of widespread class mobility and the middle\nclasses acquiring a social conscience. All this ensured that\nLabour stayed in power for most of the next two decades.\nUnfortunately the mid 1970s saw the trades unions adopting bully boy tactics with their strangle hold over the\nLabour Government. Hence the left wing dream died and\nrightwing Thatcherism was born. With it went the careers\nof many a polit calf y vocal popstar.\nThe 1980s British economy boomed because Thatcher\nliberated the financial institutions of their cumbersome,\nFELIX FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER NEWS FEATURE 7\nWith politicians rushing to kiss every available baby and shake every offered hand, it's often forgotten that there are other public figures, particularly mu sci an s and popstars,\nwho are quite prepared to voice a political preference. Afua Osei looks into the love-hate relationship between popular music and politicians.\npolitics financially unsound traditions. She sold public utilities so\nthat everyone could be an entrepreneur. Everyone earned\nincredible amounts of money, most famously the Eastend barrow-boys who infested the city as stockbrokers.\nThe music scene during the 80s sums up this\nBacchanalian era perfectly, with slick music acts such as\nSpandeau Ballet, Sade, Wham, and Duran Duran dominating. Every self-respecting yuppie religiously knew the\nwords to Harry Enfield's \"Loadsamoney\" anthem and\nbubl e gum dustbin pop was produced by the barrel load.\nStock, Aitken & Waterman were the pioneers of throw away music of the likes of Kylie Minogue, Jason\nDonovan, Bros, and Sonia (don't forget that Messieurs\nStock and Aitken are both dedicated Tories). Not all the\nmu sci an s were turned into instant Tories though. Red\nWedge, a grouping of pop ster s who supported Labour\nwrote songs, sang at gigs and appeared on TV to promote\ntheir chosen political party. Despite the mood of that\ntime, Red Wedge thrived, headed by the likes of Billy\nBragg and Paul Weller. Their campaigning for Labour\ngenerated a lot of publicity and everybody, understand-ably, loved their music, particularly students.\nUnfortunately the student population of the 1980s was\nrather fickle in its party allegiances. They devoted their\nlives to Labour; that is, until they got a high-powered job\nin the city with a fat salary. At this point, they would get\ngreedy and vote Tory. However, too much of a good\nthing is bad for you; inflation spiralled into maddening\nheights and the giddy hedonism ended. Mass unemployment among the middle-classes saw people who had once\nearned disgusting but pleasant sums of money on the\ndole, along with a tragic class of people who had never\nexperienced the ruthless joys of capitalism. The recession\ntriggered a fatalistic party mood amongst the young, and\nrave sub-culture emerged. Rave's offspring, techno and\nambient, are deeply rooted in drug culture, and with the\nglum job prospects of the early 90s, the widespread availability of recreational drugs provided an easy esa cpe. On a political level, today has seen the British public\nrunning back to Labour in their droves-like are pen tent unruly child running back home. New Labour has got the\ngolden touch again, due to a polished PR department and\na leader who reflects middle class aspirations. They have\ntransformed themselves from a pair of BHS boxer shorts to an Armani number and the Brit popper s love it. It\nremains to be seen whether New Labour have the consistency to offer the country a future that is as bright as their\nimage, and if the red roses pinned to the sleeves of pop\nstars become an em baras s ment. Unfortunately for all political parties today's2030 s year-olds are highly sophisticated non-voters. They are\nunimpressed by politics as it appears sleaze infested. It\nwill be interesting to see whether something as frivolous\nas \"Britpoppers for Labour\" may seduce the young vote.\n\n"

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 6 TH DECEMBER FELIX SPORT\nFootball Seconds loose out to\nluck of the draw\nWith the league stage of the BUSA\ncup over and the knockout stage\nstarting today the stakes were high\nfor IC seconds. The winner of this\nmatch would be playing a team from\nsomewhere in the south-east - a day\nat the seaside a distinct possibility if,\n\"The Slags\" could pull this one off.\nThe opponents were LSE - the\nleague leaders of the division above\nus. The odds looked stacked against\nus, especially as three regular team\nmembers were out with flu but we\nknew that LSE couldn't match our\npassion, determination or sheer good\nlooks.\nThe game started badly - with our\ndefence looking surprisingly shaky a dubious penalty was conceded and\nduly scored. We were two down\nwithin ten minutes and in desperate\nneed of a booster from somewhere.\nIt came when the ball was played to\nthe right and latched onto by the\nblonde blur that was GoldiLoz - this\nweek's birthday boy looking good in\nhis swanky new boots - who's low\ncross was hammered home by the\never goal-hungry Martin, who then\nlevelled the score with a sensational\nlob. More defensive madness,\nthough, meant that at half-time the\nscore was 3-2 to them.\nAn arousing speech by Captain\nCondom Steve got us going and from\nthe restart our hard tackling and\nsuperb hairstyles put LSE on the\nback foot. A subtle flick down the\nline by simple Si sent the mighty\nRobo away and his superb cross was\nfinished off in fine style by fourth\nteam ringer Tak. With the game heading into extra\ntime, and the ref looking at his\nwatch, a ball was played through our\ndefence. Neither Rob nor Will could\nget near the LSE striker and his low\nshot was deflected by goalie Steve.\nOur hearts were in our mouths as,\nseemingly in slow-motion, German\nwas fooled by a bad bounce and\nforced to palm the ball off the line.\nThe second penalty of the day was\nslotted home by LSE and there was\nbarely time for the game to restart.\nWe were left to reflect on what\nmight have been in a match that was\nbalanced, exciting and played in the\ntrue spirit of the game. At the end of\nthe day, football was the winner\n(Brian). Unfortunately we were the\nlosers.\nBritish Indoor Rowing\nchampionships retained\nAwesome Simon Dennis (Biology\nIII) powered his way to victory in the\nBritish Indoor Rowing championships in Reading last weekend.\nRacing in the Under-23 division,\nwhich was stacked to the brim with\ntop Oxbridge rowers, Dennis qualified for the final with the fifth fastest\ntime. Commentators billed the final\nas a clash between Oxford and\nCambridge, but Dennis was having\nnone of this, and was keen to keep\nthe trophy in the IC cabinet, Louis\nAttnl having achieved victory last\nyear.\nAs the race unfolded, Dennis and\nThomas Westerling (an international\nscull er) broke clear of the pack. But\nwith 700m of the 2km distance left to\nrow, Dennis roared and pulled a series of staggering splits out of the\nbag, as he trucked on to victory. His\ntime of 5.57 knocked seven seconds\noff his personal best and was only\nthree seconds off the time clocked by\nWorld record holder Greg Searle in\nthe Mens Senior final.\nIn the womens race, Alison\nTrickey (Chemistry & Management\nIII) came within a second of victory.\nIn a closely fought race, she just lost\nout to Elise Laverick (a World\nUnder-23 bronze medallist). The\nwomens squad was well represented\nin the final, highlighting their\nstrength in depth.\nBoth Alison and Simon won the\nBUSA competition, and other IC\nBoat Club rowers also figured highly in the BUSA rankings, showing that\nwinter training is going well, which\nbodes well for the summer.\nHockey Firsts bounce back\ninto top form\nTime for the old skool to take charge.\nAfter a rather nervy start, 2-0 down\nafter 15 minutes, the IC Hockey\nFirsts steamroller charged into top\ngear. Two goals in five minutes from\nshort corners. Chicken Bol drove in a shot to the far post with the venom of\na python, while Marky Mark bumbled a pile-driver between the\ngoalies legs. The score remained the\nsame until half-time. Rent Boy delivered an epic skippers half-time talk,\nprompting continued rampaging\nplay, buoyed by the promise of free-beer.\nBut, despite this the tide began to\nturn as the ginger-haired wonder of\nQMW began to spur his shambles\ntowards greater things. Increasing\npressure from QMW resulted in a well taken goal by their no. 15, making the score 3-2.\nThis stung IC back into action,\nwith Sid producing a classic,\nprompting the goalkeeper to put the\nball into his own net. There was no\nstopping the Firsts now, another\nshort-corner allowing the Dutchcome-English wonder to net our\nfourth. Despite QMW's dismal\nefforts to pierce our rock-solid\ndefence, the last laugh belonged to\nIC. On the stroke of full-time Sid\nnetted again, this time from nearly\ntwo full inches, making the final\nscore 5-3 to IC. The First's now enter\nthe second round of the ULU cup,\nand with only a mixture of Peter\nAndre fans and big girls left in the\ncompetition, our chances of securing\ntrophies for the fans must be rated as\nvery good.\nSport in brief\nRCS RUGBY\nRCS started the season with a well\nfought victory over QMW. RCS\nstarted with fire with a well worked\ntry from Mara Woodhouse, closely\nfollowed by the first yellow card in\ncollege rugby history. Leading after\nhalf-time, QMW replied by pulling\nback to within two points, until tries\nby Jack Pert, Kolone Yong and captain Psyco Dan, sealed the game for\nRCS, despite unlucky kicking by\nAndy mobile Mayes.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER Birkbeck faces funding deficit\nPHOTO: LILI TCHEANG\nIn response to the severe cut in funding provision from the Government,\nGovernors at Birkbeck College, which is part of the University of\nLondon, recently appointed a strategic working party to look at a range\nof measures to generate income and make savings on expenditure in\norder to avoid a deficit in their budget. One of the more dramatic proposals was to close down the Physics Department in the year 2000. Such\na closure would be a great loss to the University of London as much\nimportant research is carried out in the department at Birkbeck.\nThe entire College is currently being consulted on this question with a decision on the future of the Physics undergraduate and postgraduate\nstudents not to be announced until the 20th of March next year. It has\nbeen rumoured that UCL may bid to take over the department, but this\nis as yet unconfirmed.\nDoctors head for 83 hour week\nUMBAR SALAM Ministers this week have been discussing the outline of a plan to allow\njunior doctors to work a maximum of\n83 hours a week. The New Deal\nAgreement is a cause of contention\nand may be abandoned by junior\ndoctors and their leaders.\nThe general rule, which is frequently broken, is for doctors to\nspend no more than 56 hours per\nweek on the wards. The Government\nhas asked hospital managers to use\ntheir \"discretion\", amidst complaints\nfrom senior medical professionals\nthat we are producing a less competent medical workforce. This has\nlead to the misuse and overwork of\njunior doctors across the country.\nJunior doctor representative and\nLondon hospital Senior Registrar,\nDavid Wrede, commented \"we are\nextremely alarmed that this is a proposal to the detriment of the training\nof doctors, and more importantly, the\nsafety of patients.\"\nThe safety of the public if such\nshifts are reintroduced must be ques-tio ned, especially when considered\nin the light of recent media allegations concerning cover-ups of fatal\nmistakes made by overworked junior\ndoctors.\nWhen the NDA was first implemented, the British Medical\nAssociation decided long hours were\nnot an effective tool for learning. But\nby cutting hours worked by junior\ndoctors, more people would be\nrequired to do all the routine work\nperformed by the doctors.\nMinisters and some junior doctors\nargue that rigorous enforcement of\nthe NDA could interfere with specialist training where working long\nhours would be necessary, or when\nrare surgical procedures are carried\nout. A department of Health official\nsaid \"we believe there has to be a certain amount of flexibility around the\nfringes [of the agreement].\"\nSuch flexibility already exists,\ncalled the English clause, which\nallows junior doctors to work longer\nhours for the purpose of training.\nHowever, one junior doctor's spokesman claimed \"No money has\ngone into training. Maybe the ministers are debating the wrong issue,\nand a closer look needs to be taken at\nhow the doctors are taught throughout their course.\"\nThe majority of medical professionals are in agreement that an 83\nhour week is not a solution to the\njunior doctor problem.\nICMS Dean\ncontinued from front page\nwith the current clubs and societies at\nSt Mary's. Will they function separately or merge with those at\nImperial? To this, Professor\nCaldwell answered \"we don't want\nseparate sports teams for the St\nMary's and Imperial,\" though he\naccepted that in some ways it was\nnecessary to retain an identity, for\nexample in the Hospital's Cup rugby\ntournament. He drew an analogy\nwith the constituent colleges at\nOxford and Cambridge. Members of\na team could therefore play for both\nSt. Mary's and Imperial College.\nAnother question was to do with\nthe Student Body regarding the issue\nof funding. At present, St Mary's Student Union receives about\n\u00a342000 a year whereas Charing\nCross, being larger, gets \u00a370000.\nAfter the merger, as a constituent\ncollege at Imperial, the combined\ntotal would be a mere \u00a312 000. Nick\nJenkins, the first year rep likened this\nto \"the total cost of running a minibus for a year.\" Professor\nCaldwell agreed that this was a problem saying \"it was very important\nthat we maintain our level of funding\nafter the merger. Imperial College\ndoesn't fully understand what being\na medical student is like.\" He added\nthat a medical school was completely different from any of the other\nConstituent Colleges at Imperial.\nOn this point, the issue of 'how\ndifferent' was raised. Someone commented that many medical schools at\nother large universities have separate\nfacilities, often a separate medical\nbar. To this Prof Caldwell said he\nunderstood the situation but that at\nthe moment Imperial did not wish to\nlabel parts of the South Kensington\ncampus as being solely for medical\nstudents. He went on to add that the\nGeneral Medical Council stresses the\nimportance of a' multi factorial edu-cation' and that this would not be\npossible if medics started segregating\nthemselves from the rest of the student body.\nThefinalissue was the question of\ncontinued from page two\nrecently fallen to just 53.\nThe executive council of the constituency association will meet next\nweek to create a timetable for the\nselection process, before advertising\nthe post to the Conservative Party's list of approved candidates.\nquizzed\nhalls of residence, particularly the\nfuture of Wilson House. Since the\nbeginning of this term Imperial\nCollege Students from the South\nKensington Campus have been taking up residence at Wilson House,\nangering some Clinical Students who\nfelt that spare places should have\nbeen offered to them.\nAlthough not directly his responsibility, Prof Caldwell said that both\nfirst year and final year students\nwould still definitely be given places\nat Wilson House should they want\nthem. However, there was never any\npromise made to 3rd and 4th year\nClinical students regarding accommodation. Any spare places will be\navailable to students from South\nKensington though he did not see it\nbeing 'taken over' in the future. He\nsaid that Wilson House is so close to\nSt Mary's Hospital that it would be\npractical to give most of the rooms to\nmedical students because this is\nwhere they will be for a lot of the\ntime. He concluded by saying that\nthe \"current system of room allocation is not totally fair\" and that it did\nnot take into account electives and\nthe 48 week working year of Clinical\nStudents. Once again he added that\n\"Imperial College does not fully\nappreciate medical student's work\npatterns.\"\nClinical students raised questions\nconcerning the inadequacy of house\njobs provision were raised. Rory\nShaw, Director of Clinical studies,\npointed out the excellent track record\nof Mary's compared with other medical schools.\nOverall, it was felt that the two\nhour session went very well. Many\nimportant points were raised and\nsome of these will have to be\naddressed again at a future date.\nSami Ansari, the Student Union\nPresident said that it was not about\ntaking sides and that what is going to\nhappen (ie the merger) will happen.\n\"It is very important for both the\nmedical students and all the students\nat South Kensington that the merger\nruns as smoothly as possible.\"\nNo doubt Sir Nicholas will be glad\nof one thing. He pledged to give up\nalcohol for as long as he remained in\npublic office, recently describing\nhimself as \"absolutely teetotal.\" He\nwill be relieved that he has only a few tedious months of orange juice\nand fizzy water to go.\nThe fall of Sir Nicolas Scott\n\n"

Another disturbing fact uncovered by the investigation was that there have been\ncases of meningitis in the hall before.\nJust five weeks ago a twenty year old\nwomen staying at the hall was taken\nill with the disease and this time last\nyear a student contracted men in go co c cal septic a emi a, blood poisoning\ncaused by the bacteria.\nThe President of the Student\nUnion, Dot Hodge, said that the\ndeaths of the two students had been\ntraumatic \"...most students of this\nage are not accustomed to dealing\nwith this sort of grief. Our priority is\nto do everything we can to help them\ncope.\" Telephone hot-lines set up by\nthe University and the SU have been\nswamped by\ncalls, mainly from\nanxious parents\nand worried stu-dents.\nSocial life in\nthe campus has\nground to a halt\nas, after the first\ndeath, Bill Smith,\nDirector of the\nPublic Health\nAuthority, called for the cancellation\nof discos and parties saying that intimate contact, especially the transfer\nof saliva, could spread the disease.\nThe symptoms to watch out for are...\nFever\nSevere headache\nNausea and vomiting\nDislike of light\nStiffness of neck\nUnfortunately, in viral meningitis these symptoms are mild and may resemble influenza. In\nbacterial meningitis, the symptoms develop\nrapidly, often accompanied by a red blotchy skin\nrash followed by drowsiness and loss of consciousness within about eight hours.\nThe campus bar has been closed but\nmore than 1,000 undergraduates\nattended a rave at the Great Hall in\nthe SU building last Saturday night.\nFears are growing, however, with\nthe news that meningitis has now\nspread to other universities. As well\nas the thirty-two students who have\nbeen admitted for care in Cardiff, a further four serious cases have been\nreported; two at the Southampton\nInstitute and two American students\nat York university. There have also\nbeen cases at Sussex, Portsmouth,\nBournemouth and Brighton.\nUWC authorities are being tight-lipped about the scare. It is known\nthat this is the group C bacterial\nstrain of meningitis, which accounts\nfor about 30% of all bacterial cases,\nwith the majority caused by group B. The vaccine which is being used\nto inoculate students is short-acting\nand does not offer full protection. As\nyet, there is no vaccine for strain B although both groups can be treated\nwith antibiotics if caught early\nenough. Bacterial meningitis is\nspread by coughs, sneezes and kiss-ing. Each year\nthere are about\n1000 cases of\nbacterial meningitis,1 in 4 of\nwhich prove\nfatal. The other,\nmore- common\nform of meningitis is the viral\nkind, which cannot be cured with\nantibiotics. There are about 500\ncases reported annually in the UK,\nalthough the incidence is probably\nmuch higher.\nPHOTO: ALDOUS BIRCHALL IC Alumnus Brian May arriving at the Royal Albert Hail premiere of\nDisney's remake of 101 Dalmations on Wednesday night.

They will make\nup 25% of the total student body at\nImperial College and the new\nImperial College School of Medicine\nwill receive 50% of the overall\nresearch budget of Imperial College.\nThese huge changes will affect not\nonly the medics but also those currently at Imperial. It is vital that\neverything runs as smoothly as p ossi ble. With this in mind a Dean's question time was held at St Mary's last\nTuesday evening.\nThe Dean, John Caldwell, had\ncancelled two of his previous question times and even failed to turn up\nfor his own tea party at the beginning\nof term, so the question and answer\nsession was eagerly awaited by stu-dents.\nMany of the questions revolved\naround the merger of the medical\nschools and the formation of the new\nImperial College School of\nMedicine.

IC\nSeconds scored an unexpected and\nearly goal, after which RSM took\ncontrol and dominated play for the\nnext seventy minutes. With some of\nthe most dazzling and exciting play\nthis college has witnessed, IC\nSeconds were totally embarrassed,\nand to be honest might have looked\nmore at ease against our second\nteam. Two goals from Keith\nWhitehead, whose scything runs\nthrough the heart of the IC defence\nled to simple tap-ins. IC goalkeeper\n(Dracula - he can't hold crosses) had\na nightmare of a game, and Neil\nPrice and Johan Viktorsson scored\ntwo consolation goals, more through\nthe inability of RSM defence than\ngood play.\nA good team performance led to\nthe final 5-3 score line, with Neil\nPrice outstanding, and earning the\nnomination as Man of the Match.\nPainted Ladies take sweet revenge,\nas Womens Rugby storm to victory\nThe Painted Ladies (minus the vocal\nJuliette) stormed onto the pitch to\ntake revenge on the hated hussies\nfrom the Royal Free.\nIntense pressure from IC forced a massive blunder by the stretched\nRoyal Free defence, giving IC an\nearly lead. Atisa put another in the\nback of the net from one of the\nnumerous corners won by IC. After\nmuch encouragement/abuse from the\nincapacitated captain, Bente pounced\non a hopeless clearance to smash\nhome number three, leaving IC 3-0\nup at half-time.\nIn the second-half, Royal Free\nfinally got their act together and\npulled back a lucky goal straight\nafter Olympia notched up IC's fourth. However, stern defence, particularly by Steph and Hege, stopped\nRoyal Free getting back into the\ngame.\nThe final score line, a convincing\nfour - one victory to the Painted\nladies, proved sweet revenge.

However\ncircumstances conspired against us\nto such an extent that eight players\nwere unavailable, and it is down to\nthe team's hard work that a draw was\nobtained.\nAfter a shaky start due to so many\nnew faces we quickly got into our\nstride and scored two quality goals,\none clinically finished by Darren, the\nother a supreme 25 yard chip by\nNak. From then however Queen\nMary's dominated the game leaving\nIC with only a few chances to wrap\nup the game. Queen Mary's pulled\none back before halftime; a tame\nshot which the 'keeper could only\npush onto the post was followed up\nand tapped into an empty net.\nIn the second half QMW wasted\nvarious chances, though IC's defence played their part producing\nnumerous last ditch tackles to keep\ntheir goal in tact. The 'keeper also\nplayed his part; one shot in particular\nproduced, at full stretch, a finger tip\nsave. Queen Mary's controversial\nequalise r came with only minutes\nremaining, from a corner our keeper\nwas physically obstructed from\nreaching the ball and the resulting\nshot was cleared off the line by Paul.\nThe referee said, \"No obstruction\"\nand that the ball had crossed the line.\nEveryone was outraged but despite\nheated protests the goal stood.\nEverybody played their part in a good team performance, though a mention must be given to the central\nmidfield duo of Adam and Nak who\nwere superb.\nRoll on Saturday and the n utters of\nUMDS...\nFinal thrust saves Virgin's reputation\nThe Womens Rugby team began\nstrongly (as expected), with a defence penetration by Becky leading to a try from Petra within the first\ntwo minutes.

The game\nproved an unexpected struggle, with\nUCL scoring again before half-time.\nThe forwards stormed through with\nfantastic ruc king, and Lynsey scored\nto take it to 10-10.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER NEWS 3\nWilson House fines students to enforce security\nKENT YIP\nFour residents of Wilson House were\nfined for contravening a new house\nrule, introduced a month ago, after a tribunal hearing on Monday.\nThe new rule forbids the opening\nof the front door to people who\nrequest at the window for access into\nthe house. Controversy arose when\nsome residents were fined for opening the door to other fellow residents.\nMost of them paid up, but those who\nregarded the punishment as being\nunfair refused to do so. One of them\ncomplained that he was totally\nunaware of the new rule and found it\nridiculous to be fined for opening the\nfront door to one of his housemates,\nwho had been unable to retrieve his\nown keys from his pocket because he\nwas carrying a box of food. This\nview was shared by most of the medical students.\nSpeaking to Felix, Bryan Clarke,\nthe Warden of Wilson House, took\nthe opposite tack, saying that he did\nnot believe that anyone could have\nfailed to know of the rule, which is\nstated clearly next to the door button.\nAny students who missed the sign\nand opened the door were also\nwarned by the porter on duty that\nthey were in breach of the rules.\nFines were only given to those who\neither ignored the porter's warnings\nor argued with him using abusive\nlanguage.\nIn defence of the inflexibility of\nthe new rule, Dr Clarke said \"A rule\nis a rule. It has to be all or nothing for\nit to work.\" When challenged as to\nwhy the new measure was introduced\nwith neither the knowledge nor the\nsupport of the President of the\nStudent Union and the Hall\nPHOTO: LILI TC HE AN GA new form of entrance fee for College? Fines for holding the door open\nfor a housemate may be harsh, but is the security risk worth it?\nCommittee, he stressed the urgent\nneed to take appropriate actions in\nview of the fast deteriorating security\nsituation in Wilson House. \"What is\nhappening here is a complete state of\nanarchy. We have already had two\nassaults and a series of thefts this\nterm, with the damage of the worst\none estimated at \u00a3500.\"\nOn several occasions, students\nhave reported people who have nothing to do with the medical school\nsleeping in the building. \"I have seen\ndrug-dealers and prostitutes hanging\naround here at 3.00 am at night.\"\ncommented Dr Clarke. \"The crime\nprevention unit of the local police\nwas called in, and we were advised to\nenforce this new rule. I am happy to\naccept any suggestions from residents and talk to the Hall Committee,\nbut I am not prepared to let the current trend continue.\"\nSome students saw themselves as\nvictims of the lack of investment\nfrom the College to improve the situ-ation. The need for a24 hour porter\nservice and the installation of security cameras around the house have\nlong been advocated. Whilst Dr\nClarke sym pathis ed with them, he\npointed out that acts of vandalism in\nthe past committed by the minority\nonly made the College reluctant to\ninvest further. \"I understand that the\nchanges I have brought are not liked\nby some students, but I am responsible for the interest of the majority of\nthe students. If this means being\nlabelled as a dictator, then so be it.\"\nSami Ansari, President of the\nStudent Union of St Mary's, described the way College handled\nthis matter as a \"gung-ho approach\npolicy typical of IC bureaucrats\" and\nhighlighted the inconsistency in\napplying the new security measure.\nNick Jenkins, the Student\nRepresentative closely involved in\nthis matter, summed up the outcome\nof the tribunal hearing by saying \"It\nwas sadly inevitable that they would\nbe fined. What we've got out of this\nis to force our Dean and hierarchy at\nIC to address the security problem at\nIC as a whole and the appropriateness of certain security measures. It\nis sad to see that their attention has to\ncome in this way.\"\nSir Scott de selected despite Parliamentary backing\nJACKIE S KEA TE Sir Nicholas Scott has now been officially de selected as the Conservative\ncandidate for Kensington and\nChelsea in the next election.\nSir Nicholas himself called the\nmeeting last Monday, at which 1000\nConservatives from his constituency\nmet specifically to vote on whether\nor not to allow him to stand. The\nresults were conclusive - 509 to 439\nwere in favour of de selection, despite\nhis desperate last-minute speech,\nwhich had many people thinking he\nhad made a miraculous escape.\nSir Nicholas Scott, who was found\nby police lying blatantly drunk in the\ngutter following this year's Tory\nParty Conference in Bournemouth,\nhas since pledged to give up alcohol\nfor as long as he holds public office.\nHowever, at the meeting on Monday,\nhis fellow Tories were obviously\nunconvinced by his poor excuses that\nhe had merely \"suffered an attack of\ndizziness\" caused by painkillers foolishly mixed with an allegedly \"mod-est amount\" of alcohol.\nThe unexpected result, greeted by\nraucous cheers from the assembled\nTories, means that a political career\nlasting more than 30 years has effectively been brought to a sticky end.\nSir Nicholas, now 63, spent 13 years\nas a Northern Ireland minister and\nseven years as the Minister for the\nDisabled.\nDoubts were originally raised\nabout Sir Nicholas' suitability as an\nMP last year, after he ran away\nanonymously from a car accident,\nleaving a child trapped in a pushchair. Although he was not des-elected, this \"minor indiscretion\" led\nto him being fined and banned from\ndriving.\nLast Monday's treatment of Sir\nNicholas Scott may be seen as a warning to other Conservative MPs,\ngiving them a timely reminder that\nthey are constantly in the public eye\nand that the Conservative Party will\nnot tolerate politicians who make bad\nreputations for themselves.\nHis associates, local Conservative\nParty members, expressed their\nunambiguous belief that he should\ngo. One remarked \"Someone like\nNicholas Scott is a dinosaur. He is an\nold-style Tory who was simply there\nbecause of his connections...No way\ndoes he deserve to be an MP any\nmore.\"\nThe search goes on to find a replacement candidate to stand at the\nnext election to represent the\nKensington and Chelsea area.\nAmong the contenders for this seat,\none of the safest in the country, are\nthought to be Sir John Wheeler, the\nNorthern Ireland minister and MP for\nWestminster North, Hartley Booth,\nMP for Finchley, Alan Clark, and\nTerry Dicks, MP for Hayes and\nHarlington, whose majority has\ncontinued on page 4\n\n"

My\npoint was about the impenetrability\nof some sports articles because of\nthese nicknames, not the nicknames\nthemselves. I know all about this\nteam spirit malarkey, but you show\nme a piece on the England Cricket\nteam by Christopher Martin-Jenkins\nin the Telegraph that refers to Ian\nBotham as Beefy and I shall begin\ndigesting headgear. Nuff said.\nlit was quite a coincidence that there\n!should be an article about College\nSecurity in last weeks Felix, as I had\nalready planned to mention that\nesteemed band of men and women\nthis week. A number of people have\napproached me and moaned at the\nlevel of security at IC with regard to\nbikes (you see the pressures of this\njob- its me that gets all the com-plaints, you know). I have heard a story where someone had bits stolen\nfrom a bike under the glare of a security camera near Southside. There\nhave been instances of bicycles being\nstolen from outside the Chemistry\nDepartment. A few weeks ago, there\nwas a letter from the ridiculously\ntitled Humbaba. Excusing the pathetic comment about using a pen name\nto avoid the hate\nmail (drastically\nmiscalculated \u2014\nself-importance\nmethinks), the letter made a good\npoint about a bike\nbeing stolen from\nthe RSM walk-way, despite the\ncamera coverage, j Clearly, something is going\nbadly wrong with\nSecurity. Nobody\nwould expect or\nwant a security\nblanket over\nCollege that, to ^QJ\u00a3g Qjf\nSimon Baker\nquote Felix\nLeiter in Diamonds are Forever, a mouse wearing sneakers could not\nget through. However, when one\nhears of examples like this, on top of\nthe Great Computer Swindle from\nlast year, the level of service begins\nto look very poor. Looking around\nIC, I don't think under funding is to\nblame, more a case of appa ling value\nfor money. I have long suspected a case of\nwhat we doctors\ncall Catering\nSyndrome. You\nmay know it as\nbad management.\nThis has been\nconfirmed by last\nweek's article,\nwhere it emerged\nthat we could\nonly manage\n25% cover for\nstrikers because\nof trade union\nregulations.\nForgive me, but\nthis is 1996, not\n1979. People don't run organisations\nlike that anymore. Together with the\nnon-issue of swipe cards to the\nReason\nreplacements because of IC regulations, the situation looks farcical. As\nwith Catering, the College should put\nout to tender the contract to keep us\nsafe in our beds/labs. Imperial is in\nthe business of education, not run\nning service companies badly. Oh\nand by the way, don't you think it\nwould be rather a good idea to record\nthe pictures from the cameras? It may\nsound crazy, but it might prove use\nfill.\nThe Weekly Poem, which shares this\npage with your humble columnist,\nhas caused me problems.\nAcknowledging that it is a useful foil\nto my diatribes, I can't help noticing\nhow perpetually depressing the output of PoetIC is. The tongue that pronounces death and doom, our love\ndestroyed by the ocean, I hear the\nagonising moans,/Societies sickening groans. I feel all miserable now.\nSo a little competition, I think.

Members of one of the\nsafest Conservative seats in the\ncountry voted last Monday by 509\nvotes to 439 to de select Sir Nicholas\nScott following a range of embarrassing incidents culminating in him\nbeing found face down in the gutter\nduring the party conference in\nBournemouth two months ago. He\nhad been taken into a private room to\nbe told of the decision, returning\nashen-faced to the hall to discuss\ntheir opinion of his conduct. \"You\nhave told be in no uncertain terms\nwhat that is. During the remainder of\nmy time in Parliament I will give my\nwholehearted support to this party\nand to John Major. I will continue\nwith as sid u it y to look after the interests of my constituents. It is a sad\nmoment for me.\"\nSir Nicholas had only just survived selection for the recently\nmerged Kensington and Chelsea seat\nwhen he failed to stop after an accident where a toddler had been\ntrapped in a car. As Minister for the\nDisabled he was censured by the disabled community and his own\ndaughter over his policies. In a weakened position, he faced a coalition of the dotty right and those association members who thought\n'enough is enough\". The opinion on\nScott was not unanimous: said one\nmember \".. .it was a bit of a witch\nhunt in there, and when you have a kangaroo court and a witch hunt,\nthere has to be a victim, and it was\nhim.\"\nI still cannot help thinking that\ngetting rid of a senior Tory in a bitter\nbattle three months before a general\nelection is unwise at the very least\nConstituency associations aren't famous for examining the wider\nissues, like contemplating the effect\non the public of booting out a distinguished MP three months before a General Election. They should also\nconsider sort of party they want to\nsee after the election. Since the\ndeparture of Margaret Thatcher in\n1990, the party has seen its idealism\nturned into ideology. Sir Nicholas\nand others on the centre-left of the\nparty are an important counterweight to some of their shriller ban-te rings. Constituency associations\nare usually more extreme in their\nviews than the Parliamentary party,\nand Kensington and Chelsea is no\nexception to this. Now they have\ndone their worst to Sir Nicholas, they\nwill no doubt engage in similar\nwrangling s over the new candidate.\nEurosceptics will surely be looking\nfor someone in the mould of|\nRedwood, Cash or Tebbit. This seat\nis a jewel in the eyes of those who\nwould seek to take it, and we can certainly look forward to some interesting local debate in the ensuing\nmonths.\nThe Weekly Poem\nThe Long Journey Home\nAs my eyelids open to the dawn of a new day,\nIt is night!\nThe clock reads 80:11, and with puzzled interest I survey\nThe people sitting opposite me.\nThe lady with the hat reading Erye Enaj,\nAnd the man with the Alorotom phone.\nThe child asleep on the beret of his mother,\nShe is the lady with a wedding ring on her right hand,\nAnd the Lemac cigarettes protruding from her coat.\nNext to her is the priest,\nWith his copy of the Elbib.\nBut as my mind approaches some semblance of consciousness,\nI see that they are all ghouls,\nSee-through spectre s of the night,\nAnd the cars' lights shine through them\nand blind my eyes shut again.\nI must sleep,\nfor I will be home soon,\nand everything will be normal once again.\nKeith\nPoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College.
