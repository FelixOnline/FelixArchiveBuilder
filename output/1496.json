    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX\n22 Friday 07 October 2011\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot album of the week\nClams Casino\nInstrumental\nMixtape\n2011\nInstrumental Hip-hop is officially \u2018it\u2019. You can\u2019t go\nmore than a few hours in the day without some producer deciding that hip-hop would be infinitely better\nwithout an ex-parole officer pretending to be gangster\n\u2018spitting rhymes\u2019 over his beloved beats. Remove the\ndistracting, tired clich\u00e9s about having a big dick and\nyou\u2019re left with atmosphere, nuance, and the kind of\nmusic that will leave you rolling your shoulders hypnotically for hours on end.\nClams Casino\u2019s free mixtape, released in April, is\nthe perfect embodiment of this instrumental hip-hop\nethos. It has emotion; it has syncopated drums rolling over each other like kids falling down a hill; and\nit has a sense of the epic, which hip-hop can usually\nonly create with obnoxiously loud horns, a la Usher\u2019s\n\u2018Yeah\u2019.\nTowards the end of the summer term, when most of\nus have finished our exams (sucks to be you, Biologists/Biochemists), the Union sometimes has a DJ\noutside, floating music through the sun in the Quad.\nMy little dream is that the DJ will turn off the bro-step, and stick on this super smooth mixtape.\nIf you spend all your evenings on Pitchfork you\u2019ll definitely know more about instrumental hip-hop than me.\nTell how much more by tweeting me @kadhimshubber.\n(Better still, tweet @NMEmagazine and tell them to\ngive me a job.)\nI\ns there a more appealing time warp than\nan old record player? Not only does the\nstandard matt black metal and peeling\nwood-look veneer sum up a bygone\nera, but the sound quality still surpasses\nanything that digitised files can muster. I\u2019m\nsure that most of us have, at some point in our\nadolescence, played some of our parents ageing record collection out of curiosity and I\u2019m\nsure that most of us were quite disappointed;\nfor me, the artists were so disappointing that I\ndidn\u2019t even take the records out of their covers.\nPart of this issue is a clash of tastes. Firstly,\nmy dad doesn\u2019t really seem to have any; it\u2019s\nodd how someone went to the trouble of buying what must have been a fairly decent record\nplayer all those decades ago and never expressed any interest in music at all. Instead, the\nLPs were my mother\u2019s and they really weren\u2019t\nworth listening to.\nOddly, she has good (well, acceptable) taste\nin music; she\u2019s into Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Joan Baez and the like, not really my\nthing. However, these artists did not appear\nin my mother\u2019s record collection, only in the\nmore recently acquired CD library. Instead,\nthere were albums by Neil Sedaka, the New\nSeekers (if I remember correctly) and a whole\nload of other stuff that no one in polite society\nwould ever admit to owning. I know that we\nall have guilty pleasures and that the folly of\nyouth does result in some fairly bad decisions,\nbut this was on another scale.\nHow was this even possible? Was my mother\nthe victim of a record swap that went horribly\nwrong? Or was it that her tastes matured for\nthe better as she grew up? I have never got\nround to asking her about this thorny topic, but\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone: my experience is common amongst people of my generation.\nMost of our parents come from an age\nthat produced some fantastic music, and yet\nit seems to be an insurmountable challenge\nto find anyone who actually liked any of the\nbands and singers who have gone down in history for the right reasons. Some of my friends\u2019\nparents describe themselves as fans of David\nBowie and Led Zeppelin, and yet none got\naround to buying their albums, what was going\nMusic, through the ages\nC. I. Franke would like a word with your parents about\ntheir shockingly bad taste in music\ngoing to be remembered fondly in the future.\nFrankly, I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s going to be seen\nas great in the years to come from this generation\u2019s music scene. I would have said Muse,\nbut they\u2019ve been heading downhill since Absolution. Amy Winehouse is a safe bet, and,\nas morbid as it is to suggest as much, dying\nyoung has certainly helped her on that front.\nWhat we can be sure of is that a lot of the\nmusic around today owes so much to the 60\u2019s\nand 70\u2019s, an era of truly awful and truly great\nmusic. The Beatles took the Mersey beat and\ngave us pop music, The Rolling Stones took\nthe blues and gave us rock, Jimi Hendrix\nshowed us that the limitless potential of the\nelectric guitar and David Bowie, whilst dabbling in an astonishingly vast variety of genres,\nplayed an important part of bringing electronic\nmusic to the fore, along with Brain Eno and\nKraftwerk.\nSadly, a lot of us live in blind ignorance of\nthe groundbreaking artists who define new\nmusical genres, preferring instead to listen to\nfamiliar music inspired by the sounds of previous generations.\nYour parents\u2019 record collection: nothing but a catalogue of embarassing purchases\non in their minds?\nThere is a rather depressing answer: a recent survey by Twentieth Century Fox (prob-ably not the best source of cast iron evidence)\nhas revealed that about one in four parents in\nBritain have lied to their children about what\nmusic they listened to and which concerts they\nwent to - a vain attempt to impress the younger\ngeneration.\nOf course, for there to be good music, there\nmust be bad music, and history shows us that\ncommercial success does not equate to artistic\nbrilliance (consider, for example, that Westlife\nand Cliff Richard both have 14 number ones).\nBut this also leads us to consider how easy it is\nto tell, from when they\u2019re at their peak, who is\n\u201cOne in four parents in\nBritain have lied to their\nchildren about what music they listened to.\u201d\nDo you love\nmusic?\nDo you love to\nwrite?\nAre you a music\nsnob?\nWrite for Felix\nMusic!\nEmail us for more\ninformation:\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nMake sure not to miss\nIron & Wine\nHackney Empire, E8\nSunday October 9, 2011\nwww.hackneyempire.co.uk\nAs the music world\u2019s second favourite alt folk,\nguitar playing, bearded hippy, Iron & Wine\u2019s Sam\nBeam presents a more acceptable alternative to\nthose who are too embarassed to say they like\nBon Iver. Like Justin Vernon, Beam moved into\nslightly more experimental territory with his most\nrecent album, the critically acclaimed folk-rock in-stnat classic Kiss Each Other Clean which achieved\na rare 9/10 in NME. However, this gig promises to\nbe a return to his stripped-back folk roots, accompanied by Czech pianist Marketa Irglova.\nThose looking to see Beam play his more recent\nwork should head to the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire\non Monday October 10. There he will be playing\nwith a full backing band and will be supported by\nelectrobilly outfit The Mules.\nBoth gigs promise to be great evenings for lovers\nof folk, rock, and anything in between.

Beutler and\nJules A. Hoffmann \u201cfor their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity\u201d and the other\nhalf to Ralph M. Steinman \u201cfor his discovery of the\ndendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity\u201d.\nBetween them, Beutler, Hoffmann and Steinman\nrevealed how the innate and adaptive phases of the\nimmune response are activated, giving us new insight into disease mechanisms and opening up new\nways to treat infections, cancer and inflammatory\ndiseases.\nPhysics\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 was divided,\none half awarded to Saul Perlmutter, the other\nhalf jointly to Brian P. Schmidt and Adam G.\nRiess \u201cfor the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of\ndistant supernovae\u201d.\nIn 1998, Perlmutter, leading the Supernova\nCosmology Project, and Schmidt and Riess,\nleading the High-z Supernova Search Team, all\npublished papers that revealed something extraordinary about the universe: it was not only\nexpanding, but the rate at which it was doing\nso was accelerating. Since then, physicists have\ntried to make sense of this discovery. They call\nthe stuff responsible for the acceleration \u201cdark\nenergy\u201d, but its nature is still a mystery.\nChemistry\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2011 was awarded\nto Dan Shechtman \u201cfor the discovery of quasicrystals\u201d.\nThe atoms inside a quasicrystal are packed\nin a pattern that cannot be repeated. Before\nShechtman\u2019s discovered these strange crystals\nusing an electron microscope, chemists believed\nthat periodically repeating patterns were needed\nin order to obtain a crystal.\nIn early October this year, there were 687\nconfirmed discoveries of planets outside our\nsolar system. This number is growing almost\ndaily and as it increases we can begin to dig\ndeeper into the details of these planets, known\nas exoplanets because of their \u201cextrasolar\u201d\nnature, and explore their properties and those\nof the planetary systems they exist within.\nA paper, to be published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, announcing the discovery of \u201cstardust\u201d in two\nexoplanet systems is a step forward in this\ndirection. The dust was found in planetary\nsystems hundreds of lights years away from\nEarth.\nAlexander Krivov, the lead author on the\npaper and an astronomer at the Friedrich\nSchiller University Jena in Gemany, believes\nthe dust formed within a debris disk. Debris\ndisks are common features in planetary sys-tems. Our own solar system has two: the asteroid belt that lies between Mars and Jupiter,\nand the larger Kuiper belt that extends outwards from the orbit of Neptune.\nDebris disks are thought to be left over\nfrom the formation of a star and its planets.\nThe first step in the formation of a planetary\nsystem is the creation of a protostar at its cen-tre. Around the protostar is a disk of matter,\nout of which planets begin to form. This happens when chunks of the matter in the disk\nbegin to stick together, attracting more matter towards them through gravity. Eventually,\nenough matter is gathered to form a planet.\nThe stuff left in the disk continues to orbit the\nyoung star and becomes a debris disk.\nKrivov believes that dust forms when rocks\nin the debris disk collide. His team are the\nfirst to find this \u201cdebris dust\u201d in a system discovered using transiting planets.\nThere are several ways of detecting exo-planets. One, known as the transit method,\ninvolves measuring the amount of light coming from a particular star that astronomers\nsuspect has orbiting planets. When a planet\npasses in front of the star, as seen from Earth,\nit creates a small dip in the amount of light\nwe measure. One such dip could easily be\nexplained away, but a series of dips that occur periodically can mean only one thing: an\nexoplanet. The transmit method is capable of\nmeasuring the density of exoplanets and, by\nextension, their size.\nThe fraction of planetary systems that can\nbe studied using the transit method is small\nbecause Earth, the exoplanet and its star must\nbe perfectly aligned for it to work. However,\nbecause of the extra information that can be\ngleaned this way \u2014 namely the size of the\nplanet \u2014 it is still a useful method.\nBy using the transit method, Krivov and his\nteam were able to find debris dust by looking\nfor the telltale increase in radiation caused by\nthe star warming up the dust and the dust then\nradiating this heat. The astronomers see this\nas a radiation curve above the radiation curve\nof the star.\nKelly Oakes\nDistant stardust found\nArtist\u2019s impression of a debris disk around a star with exoplanets\nRitalinbringsyouaroundfaster\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology neuroscientists studying the effects of anaesthesia\non patients at Massachusetts General Hospital have found that Ritalin, a drug used to\ntreat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD), could help bring patients out of anaesthesia almost immediately.\nPublished in the journal Anaesthesiology, Emery Brown and colleagues found that\nanaesthetised rats injected with Ritalin were\nbrought out of anaesthesia faster. Anaesthetised rats given Ritalin were revived in an\naverage of 90 seconds. Rats that were not\ngiven Ritalin took 280 seconds. The researchers hope that this effect can be replicated in\nhumans so that patients spend less time in a\ngroggy, disorientated state.\nAfter a procedure is completed, the anaes-thesiologist stops administering anaesthetic\nto the patient. The patient takes around five\nto ten minutes to regain the ability to breath\nunassisted but remains confused and disorien-tated for up to two hours.\nIt would be better if doctors were able to\nbring patients out of anaesthesia more quickly\nso that they can make important and informed\ndecisions after their operation. Ritalin increases the amount of dopamine in the brain\nand improves focus and attention in ADHD\npatients.\nA similar effect is observed in anaesthetised\npatients. Ritalin awakens the parts of the brain\nresponsible for decision making faster than\nthey recover unassisted.\nBringing patients around more quickly\nalso means that patients spend less time\nin costly operating theatres \u2013 even a small\ntime saving of ten minutes per patient will\nreduce costs significantly over the course\nof a year.\nUnfortunately, some patients experience\nunwanted side effect with Ritalin, such as\nhyperventilation, hypertension and nausea.\nHowever, Zheng Xie, assistant professor of\nanaesthesia at the University of Chicago, expects that it will be possible to design other\ndrugs that have the same effect as Ritalin.\nBrown and co-workers are currently seeking\napproval for clinical trials.\nTom Phillips\nTransiting planets reveal dust in far away planetary systems\nFollow the latest science news\nfrom Imperial and more on our\nFacebook page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\nLike us on Facebook\nThis week the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prizes\nwere announced.

    "content": "MonsterMind\nFinally, a game you\u2019re unlikely to have stumbled across. MonsterMind is a Facebook game,\nbut bear with me for just a moment. Normally\nI\u2019m no fan of FB games, so it came as a pleasant surprise when I was introduced to MM and\nfound it rather enjoyable. The game is currently\nin its infancy, running as a beta, but it has poten-tial. The creators of the game realise that most\nFB games \u2013 though called \u2018social games\u2019 \u2013 are\nfar from social, unless you count giving virtual\nbales of hales to your friends a form of stimulating contact. In MM you control your own\ncity, and are tasked with attacking your friend\u2019s\nsettlements with various monsters whilst simultaneously protecting your own hub from theirs.\nIt\u2019s more interactive than many other games on\nthe market, and doesn\u2019t require FB credits to\nplay - at least on paper. You do earn currency\nthrough building virtual businesses, but it can\nbe slow going, and the temptation to spend a\nfew pounds to get a boost is strong. Fun? Yes.\nWill it have a future? Watch this space. Worth\nsome of your time certainly.\nThe Nintendo 3DS\nGave me a headache. I don\u2019t like headaches.\nReflow\nAnother game tucked away from the mad-ding crowd. Reflow, by the two man team\nXymatic, is an even smaller game for the\niPod/ iPhone. The game is simple but addicting \u2013 you need to direct one ore more dynamic particle flows into a bowl. This is achieved\nby using your body as the slopes. This led to\nan interesting situation where I was standing\nin a crowd with my arms twisting and positioning themselves madly \u2013 a little like the\nKinect I guess... In addition you can also take\npictures and use them to direct the flow. Need\na straight path? Take a picture of the Queen\u2019s\nTower and use the architect\u2019s good work to\nyour advantage. It\u2019s a fun little app, and the\n\u00a30.69 price tag is unlikely to break the bank.\nUnless you\u2019ve spent your student loan on\nbooze, that is.\nOnLive\nFine, you would\u2019ve been hard pressed to miss\nthis one as well. OnLive, the cloud gaming\nplatform, also showed itself at the event. The\nOnLive system basically allows you to play\ngames without the need for a powerful PC behind you. It achieves this by letting a remote\nserver run games for you and stream a live\nfeed to you, though you do need a wired 5MB+\ninternet connection for it to work smoothly,\n10MB+ recommended. Right now the highest quality you can receive is 720p, but the\ncompany is working up to bring it to the 1080\nstandard. The hardware you need, the OnLive\nbox, costs \u00a370, and though you have to pay\nfor a monthly subscription (\u00a36.99/month for\nthe PlayPack Bundle) it gives you access to a\nhell of a lot of features. I wrote a whole article\non the system several months ago when it was\nstill fairly new, and there\u2019s not enough space\nhere for me to go on, so I won\u2019t. Sufficed to say\nOnLive is an exciting new advancement in the\nworld of gaming, far more so than the Kinect,\nand certainly something to keep a keen eye on.\nJust don\u2019t forget your revision.\nI\nguess now\u2019s the time for me to offer\na late (but warm) welcome to all the\nfreshers who\u2019ve stumbled onto the\nGames section. I would\u2019ve written for\nthe Fresher\u2019s Issue, but I was too busy\ndoing more important stuff like working on\nmy rock-hard abs, jet skiing in the Caribbean\nand seducing beautiful women. Oh, and playing video games.\nDuring my action-packed thrill ride of a\nsummer I managed to find time to go to Eurogamer Exposition 2011. I\u2019d booked my\ntickets months ago, before I took up the most\nillustrious and well-respected (I wish) post\nof grand mighty Games editor, and as such I\ndidn\u2019t get a press pass. Still, I\u2019m man enough\nnot to dwell on that fact too much.\nAs usual you had your slew of somewhat\nsimilar army shooters: Call of Duty: Modern\nWarfare 3, Battlefield 3, you know the stuff.\nIf you\u2019re at all interested in these games then\nyou\u2019ve no doubt read all about them somewhere else. So, for my first article of this\nterm I\u2019ll be talking/waffling about some of\nthe things you may well have missed \u2013 that\nis, if you went at all (obviously if you didn\u2019t\ngo you\u2019re even less likely to have seen them).\nThe Kinect and its kids\nOK, I admit, you were very unlikely to miss\nthe\nstalls featuring a Kinect \u2013 you just had to\nlook for those people jumping about as if\ntheir skin was crawling with flesh-eating fire\nants. Just Dance 3(Ubisoft), Dance Central\n2 (Harmonix Music Systems) and the infuriatingly addictive Fruit Ninja (Halfbrick Studios) were just a few of the games offering\npeople the chance to embarrass themselves\nin public. At \u00a370+ though the Kinect is still\na rather expensive party piece (that was the\ncheapest price I could find it for online, pre-owned). In my humble opinion it\u2019s not worth\nthe money unless you\u2019ve got a group of\nfriends who you can invite round regularly\nto mess about with.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 11\nFriday 07 october 2011\nCells captured in highest detail\nAn 100-year-old lock of hair has helped\nscientists to unravel the movements of\nearly humans on their journey toAustra-lia. Scientists have obtained a genomic\nsequence from the hair, donated in the\nearly 20th century by a man who was an\nAboriginal Australian.\nThe genome reveals that, while we\nknew when humans first arrived in Australia, our knowledge of how they got\nthere was a bit more patchy. An international collaboration of scientists, involving researchers at Imperial as well\nas University College London and the\nUniversity of Cambridge, worked on\nsequencing the genome.\nThere is strong archaeological evidence to suggest that humans were in\nAustralia 50,000 years ago. The new\ngenome reveals that Aboriginal Australians are descended from humans\nthat left Africa between 62,000 and\n75,000 years ago, long before the humans that modern Asians and Europeans descended from left.\nThe previous most widely held theory\nwas that all modern humans come from\na single wave of migration out of Africa, but the new findings show this not\nto be the case.\nNew sequencing technologies have\nmade it easier to sequence and compare\nthe genomes of individual people from\ngeographically distinct populations,\nenabling scientists to work out more\nabout the movements of early humans\nthan ever before. Dr Francois Balloux,\nwho lead the UK team on this project,\nsaid: \u201cThe science of genomics makes a\nunique contribution to our understanding of when and how humans colonised\nthe world.\u201d\nThe genome shows no genetic input\nfrom modern European Australians. It\nsupports the idea that present-day Aboriginal Australians descend from the\nfirst humans to occupy Australia and\nmeans that they represent one the the\noldest continuous populations outside\nAfrica.\nProfessor Eske Willerslev from the\nUniversity of Copenhagen, who led\nthe study, said: \u201cWhile the ancestors\nof Europeans and Asians were sitting\nsomewhere in Africa or the Middle\nEast, yet to explore their world further,\nthe ancestors of Aboriginal Australians\nspread rapidly; the first modern humans\ntraversing unknown territory in Asia\nand finally crossing the sea into Australia. It was a truly amazing journey\nthat must have demanded exceptional\nsurvival skills and bravery.\u201d\nResearchers from Imperial College teamed up with the University\nof Oxford were able to reveal how\nwhite blood cells kill diseased tissue\nusing deadly granules in more detail\nthan ever before. The findings were\npublished in the Public Library of\nScience (PLoS) and outline the use\nof optical laser tweezers and a microscope to be able to see the internals of\nwhite blood cells at the highest resolution ever.\nThe study involved white blood\ncells known as Natural Killers (NK)\nwhich play a major role in the rejection of tumours and infected cells.\nThe research was led by Professor\nDaniel Davis from the Department\nof Life Sciences, who said that \u201cNK\ncells may also play a role in the outcome of bone marrow transplants by\ndetermining whether a recipient\u2019s\nbody rejects or accepts the donated\ntissue.\u201d\nThe results of this research will allow scientists to learn more about\nhow NK cells identify which tissues\nto kill. \u201cIn the future, drugs that influence where and when NK cells kill\ncould be included in medical treat-ments, such as the targeted killing\nof tumours\u201d, Professor Davis added,\n\u201cthey may also prove useful in preventing the unwanted destruction by\nNK cells that may occur in transplant\nrejection or some autoimmune diseases.\u201d\nThe research was conducted by using\na novel imaging technique developed in\ncollaboration with physicists at Imperial whilst using a super-resolution microscope at Oxford. An NK cell and its\ntarget were immobilised using a pair of\nlaser tweezers so the microscope could\ncapture the resulting action at the interface between the cells. Inside the NK\ncell, the actin filaments created a portal to which the enzyme filled granules\nmoved towards, ready to pass through\nthe NK cell in order to reach and kill\nthe target.\nDr Alice Brown of the Department\nof Life Sciences at Imperial said that\n\u201cthese previously undetectable events\nhave never been seen in such high resolution.\u201d She was one of the researchers\nwho carried out many of the experiments involved, adding \u201cit is truly exciting to observe what happens when an\nNK cell springs into action.\u201d\nThe distance between an NK cell and\nits target when in contact is only about\na hundredth of a millimetre across and\nthe actin proteins and granules continuously change position until the target is\nkilled. As a result, the super-resolution\nmicroscope had to be able to capture in\nsuch a frame rate and with such detail\nin order to successfully reveal their ac-tivity.\nOn the use of the microscope technologies developed with the Photonics\nGroup, Professor Paul French from the\nDepartment of Physics at Imperial said\n\u201cusing laser tweezers to manipulate the\ninterface between live cells into a horizontal orientation means our microscope can take many images of the cell\ncontact interface in rapid succession\u201d,\nproviding an \u201cunprecedented means to\ndirectly see dynamic molecular processes that go on between live cells\u201d.\nThe method used maximises the\namount of light captured from the cells\nallowing for super-resolution 3D images at twice the normal resolution of a\nconventional light microscope. Professor Ilan Davis, a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellow at the University of Oxford,\ninvolved in applying such techniques\nto cell biology research, said that their\n\u201cmicroscope has given unprecedented\nviews inside living NK cells\u201d.\nFunded by the Medical Research\nCouncil, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and\na Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship, the study also won a \u00a3150,000\naward from the Rector\u2019s Research\nExcellence Prize for high academic\nachievement in research with significant potential. Both Professors Daniel\nDavis and Paul French have Wolfson\nRoyal Society Research Merit Awards.\nAlex Karapetian\nThe General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU)\nhave recently recognised guidelines\nregarding the responsibilities and\nuniversal values which should be\nconsidered by scientists.\nThe new wording of the Principle\nof Universality of Science, a prerequisite to membership of the ICSU\nfamily and the underlying foundation\nof their statutes, outlines the need for\nscientists to pay attention to their duties as well as preserving scientific\nfreedom.\nThe ICSU was founded in 1931 and\nhas a global membership of national\nscientific bodies and international\nunions, focusing on areas including\nplanning and coordinating research,\nscience for policy and strengthening\nthe Universality of Science.\nBengt Gustafsson, Chair of ICSU\u2019s\ncommittee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science\n(CFRS) said that \u201cthe balance between scientific freedom and responsibility is not always easy to get right,\nbut awareness of its significance and\nof the value of ongoing dialogue must\nbe maintained within the scientific\ncommunity.\u201d\nOn the explicit inclusion of responsibilities as well as freedoms to the\nPrinciple, he said that \u201cICSU has emphasized that this balance is critical\nboth for science and society.\u201d\nThe new wording of the Principle\nwas approved at the end of September at the ICSU\u2019s General Assembly\nin Rome. The Principle now states\nthat \u201cthe free and responsible practice\nof science.. requires responsibility at\nall levels to carry out and communicate scientific work with integrity,\nrespect, fairness, trustworthiness, and\ntransparency, recognising its benefits\nand possible harms.\u201d\nThe Principle continues to maintain\n\u201cfreedom of movement, association,\nexpression and communication for\nscientists, as well as equitable access to data, information, and other\nresources for research.\u201d\nThe CFRS was also involved in\nthe organisation of the second World\nConference on Research Integrity in\nSingapore last year, from which the\nSingapore Statement on Research Integrity was presented to the Assembly in Rome.\nThe statement emphasized good\nscientific conduct and the need for\nhonesty, accountability, professional\ncourtesy and fairness in working with\nothers.\nIn addition to the notion of re-sponsibility, the Principle promotes\nfreedom by equal opportunities for\naccess to science and, in addition,\nopposes discrimination based on factors such as \u201cethnic origin, religion,\ncitizenship, language, sex, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation, disability\nor age.\u201d\nGustafsson added that \u201cthere are\ncontinually changing challenges to\nthe freedoms of scientists, and an increased onus on the scientific community to articulate and embrace its\nresponsibilities.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the unique position of scientists as the gate-keepers of new\nknowledge in today\u2019s knowledge\nsocieties, respect for these values is\ncritically important if confidence in\nscience is to be maintained.\u201d\nAlex Karapetian\nAboriginal Australian\ngenome sequenced\nWanted for murder \u2014 have you seen this NK cell?\nScientists\u2019 responsibilities outlined\nWant to write for\nFelix Science?\nEmail us!\nKelly Oakes\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 17\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 October 2011\nAmerica\u2019s Tahir Square\nYou may not have heard about it, but there is\ncurrently a mass protest in New York\u2019s financial\ndistrict. Named #OccupyWallStreet after the\nTwitter hashtag, the protest against the banking\nindustry started on September 17 and is scheduled to last until the protesters\u2019 demands are\nmet. Accusations of police brutality, however,\nhave turned #OccupyWallStreet into a spark that\nis lighting fires of protest across America and\nWestern Europe. So what are the demands of\nthe protesters? How far will the protests spread?\nAnd is this the start of a social revolution?\nThe protesters claim to represent \u201cthe 99%\u201d;\nthat is, the poorest 99% of American soci-ety. Loosely speaking, after the recession of\n2007/2008, many billions of dollars of the\nAmerican people\u2019s taxes were given directly\nto certain banks to save them from bankruptcy.\nThese banks are now making large profits again,\nbut the vast majority of Americans (the 99%)\nare worse off because of the bailout. The pro-The disgruntled left\u2019s great fight back\nStephen Smith\nA group of New Yorkers angry at the lack of Starbucks on this block\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nSomalia\nGovernor Rick Perry has said he would consider\nsending US troops into Mexico. The United States\nhas been trying to control the drug flow across their\nSouthern border by helping fund Mexico\u2019s police\nforces. However, with growing concern that Mexico\nis not doing enough, potential Republican presidential candidates, such as Mr Perry, are keen to\nshow they are tough on drugs. The move is likely\nto cause anger in Mexico, where the government\nhas been pressuring the United States to do more\nto reduce consumer demand and the flow of arms\nsouth, rather than shifting the blame to them.\nUSA\nSeventy people were killed in a suicide bomb in\nthe capital, Mogadishu, on Tuesday. Al-Shabab, an\nextremeist Islamist group, took responsibility for\nthe attack. The attack consisted of a truck packed\nwith explosives exploding near government build-ings. Although no senior officials were killed, it\nputs pressure on the Transitional government after\na brief period of relative calm since August, when\nAl-Shabab withdrew from the capital. The government is still trying to secure territory from Islamists\nin other parts of the country as well as dealing with\na famine.\nBangladesh\nA senior member of the largest Islamic party has\nbeen charged with war crimes. Delawar Hossain\nSayedee, of the Jamaat-e-Islami Party, is facing\ntwenty charges including genocide and torture. The\ncharges have been brought against him by The International Crimes Tribunal set up last year to probe\ncrimes commited in 1971 during Bangladesh\u2019s\n(then East Pakistan) Indepence struggle against\nPakistan (then West Pakistan). Two members of the\nmain opposition, Bangladeshi Nationalist Party, are\nalso facing charges.\ntesters cannot understand why they should pay\nfor banks to survive while huge cuts are made in\nwelfare spending by the government.\nIn a more general sense, the protesters are\ndisillusioned at the lack of democracy in their\ncountry. Obama promised \u201cChange\u201d that never\nmaterialised. If the Democrats behave in a way\nthat benefits only the richest 1%, and the Republicans favour the rich more than the Democrats,\nwhat hope is there for the 99%? It is certainly\nfair to say that both parties are far to the political right of the majority of the people. #Occu-pyWallStreet is a protest at the fact US elections\noffer a choice between two evils, to the extent\nthat the only way for an American to formally\ndisapprove of their government is to not vote at\nall.\nIt is surprisingly easy to see how this curious\nbalance of power came about. In recent years,\nthe price of running an election campaign has\nsoared: a well-run campaign is more important\nthan a good manifesto in gaining votes. This\nhas driven presidential candidates \u2013 desperate\nfor the money to run a successful campaign \u2013\ninto the pockets of large companies and banks\nin search of corporate sponsorship. It is not a\nconspiracy between corporations and politicians\n(there is nothing sinister going on)- it is simply\na rational consequence of the importance of\nmoney in today\u2019s America.\nAccusations from the protesters that the real\npower lies with \u201cthe bankers\u201d were reinforced\nby allegations of police brutality. A Youtube\nvideo of a police officer spraying mace (alleg-edly without warning) into the faces of young\nwomen has sparked outrage from human rights\ngroups and activists. At the time of writing,\nmore than 700 arrests have been made (many\nfor such seemingly self-referential charges as\n\u201cresisting arrest\u201d) and activists on the ground\nclaim that the police are restricting their right to\ngather, protest and speak freely. The majority of\nprotesters have now been released.\nAs so often happens with such events, the brutality merely increased the protesters\u2019 anger and\nthe numbers have ballooned from 150 to over\n3,000 since then. Moreover, similar protests\nincluding #OccupyBoston, #OccupyChicago\nand #OccupyWashington have started, spreading hope amongst activists that a revolution is\nsoon to begin. Closer to home, #OccupyLondon\nis scheduled to begin on October 15, and has\nnearly 1,000 attendees on Facebook. That these\nprotests could spark an Egypt-style revolution\nseems unlikely, but, with momentum gathering,\nanything could happen.\nIf you\u2019re looking at this page and thinking\nthat writing about the latest political developments from across the globe is right up\nyour street, then you might just want to be\na Politics Reporter.

But why? This unusually high figure\nis rarely reached by similar programming on the BBC, and ITV aren\u2019t usually known for their ability to produce\na good period piece, or, for that matter,\nanything other than the X Factor-esque\narse-gravy which routinely hypnotises\nfourteen-year-old girls and their chavvy\nmothers. Moreover, the BBC pitched\ntheir flagship drama Spooks against\nDownton in the prime-time 9pm Sunday slot, but the first episode drew in\na mere 4.6 million - one of the lowest\nratings ever recorded for Spooks.\nJim Carter, who plays Mr Carson\nthe Butler (image: left) says \u201cpeople\n[didn\u2019t] think costume dramas [were]\nfor them - they might be \u2018a bit BBC\u2019\n- highbrow and offputting. This was\non ITV so they thought they\u2019d give it\na go\u201d.\nIf you\u2019ve never tried costume drama,\nnow is the time!\nGiven that this is Imperial I\u2019m sure that\nfew of you will be unaware that last Saturday saw the broadcast of \u2018The Wedding of River Song\u2019 - the final episode\nof the latest series of Doctor Who. This\nhas been probably one of the best seasons\nsince the 2005 revival of the show. Starting with the chilling image of a future\nversion of the Doctor being killed in \u2018The\nImpossible Astronaut\u2019 it included the\nwonderful exploration of the Doctor\u2019s\ncompanion Amy that was \u2018The Girl Who\nWaited\u2019 and the near perfect \u2018Let\u2019s Kill\nHitler\u2019. It\u2019s not surprising that I had high\nhopes for this episode.\n\u2018The Wedding of River Song\u2019begins with\nthe Doctor finally resigned to his impending death and the mysterious River\nSong trapped by the Doctor\u2019s enemies,\nthe Silence, in a mechanical spacesuit\nwhich is trying to force her to shoot him.\nShe manages to resist, thereby disrupting the fixed point in time that was the\nDoctor\u2019s death and causing all of history\nto become compressed into a just a few\nmoments and begin to collapse. The rest\nof the episode sees the Doctor trying to\nconvince River to kill him in order to\nsave time while River tries to find a way\nto save him. Needless to say by the end\nof the episode our heroes had managed to\nsave both the Doctor and time.\nWhile this was certainly a passable ending to the series, with the manner in\nwhich the Doctor manages to survive\nbeing quite clever, I can\u2019t really say that\nthat I wasn\u2019t disappointed. It\u2019s not just\nthat there were plot holes (why did the\nSilence even need River - couldn\u2019t they\nhave just used a fully robotic spacesuit to\nkill the Doctor?) and that many of scenes\nwhen time was compressed were frankly\nridiculous (with flying cars supported\nby hot air balloons and Churchill as the\nleader of a Holy Roman Empire which\napparently has London as its capital).\nIt\u2019s just that the entire episode felt a bit\nthin on the ground. Whilst the ultimate\nsolution was pretty good, it\u2019s clear that\nthe writer, Steven Moffat, had no idea\nhow to translate this into 45 minutes of\ndrama - resulting in an episode full of\nfiller. The titular wedding between River\nand the Doctor is a prime example \u2013 it\ncomes almost out of nowhere. While it\nis the case that River has been obsessed\nwith the Doctor her entire life, the Doctor\nhimself hardly knows her at that point -making it all the more surprising that it\nis he who proposes the marriage. No, I\nMaciej Matuszewski\ndon\u2019t know what I would have done better myself, and Moffat has probably done\nthe best job possible but that doesn\u2019t stop\nme feeling a bit let down!\nThinking back on the previous series,\nhowever, \u2018The Wedding of River Song\u2019\nis actually well above the average quality of a Doctor Who episode. While it is\neasy to be blinded by the few gems, the\nfact is that even series six contained its\nfair share of sub-par episodes such as\nthe completely forgettable \u2018The Curse\nof the Black Spot\u2019 and the dreadful two-part \u2018The Rebel Flesh\u2019 and \u2018The Almost\nPeople\u2019 which has guest characters\nwhose motivations change every twenty\nminutes and ends with the Doctor killing\nsomebody for no good reason.\nWhile \u2018The Wedding of River Song\u2019\nfailed because it couldn\u2019t live up to the\nimpossibly high standards expected of it,\nfar too many others fail because of lazy or\nsimply incompetent writing. Episodes are\nso often filled with deus ex machina endings and meaningless technobabble while\nevery series finale seems to threaten the\nend of the universe, or even time, thus\ncompletely devaluing the level of danger.\nThe question is, therefore, why is the\nshow so popular? The answer is quite\nsimple. In essence, Doctor Who is a\nchildren\u2019s or - to use a typical BBC euphemism - a \u2018family\u2019show. It irrefutably\noffers near peerless entertainment for the\ntarget age group, whilst remaining largely watchable for adults. But ought it be\njudged by the same criteria as a mature\nshow?\nYet it so often is, and usually favourably.\nIt has a massive adult following and I\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDownton smashes Spooks in ratings\nhave even seen some of the more significant episodes discussed on the main\npages of national newspapers. Its popularity can probably be explained in two\nways. I imagine that for many the reason\nis nostalgia, which is of course helped by\nthe show having been on our screens for\nso long. Even the show\u2019s revival has already been going for a not insignificant\nsix years \u2013 indeed I was only thirteen\nwhen I started watching it.\nFor the more serious SF fan, however,\nor at least for myself, the attraction is\nthe show\u2019s great potential. The premise\nof having a machine that can take you\nanywhere in space and time allows for\na literally endless variety of stories and\nthe show\u2019s long running nature allows\nfor a depth, both of character and plot,\nrarely found anywhere else in television.\nOf course the full potential will never be\nreached. That\u2019s not to say that family programming can\u2019t be eminently entertain-ing, series six proved that, but it means\nthat there will always be topics that won\u2019t\nbe touched and simplifications that will\nbe made. I, however, will keep watching for those glorious moments where\nthe show transcends both standard science fiction and family programming and\ncomes so close to all that it could be.\nIt\u2019s time to pick holes in the Doctor\u2019s nebulous, wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey thread\n\u201cNear peerless\nentertainment for the\ntarget age group\u201d\nThis week\u2019s TV pick\nIt\u2019s cloudier than last year at Downton Abbey, but Sybil and Mary have become more bang-tidy\nFriday | 2100 - 2130 | BBC1\nOutnumbered\nFantastic sitcom starring Hugh Dennis and Claire\nSkinner set in the Brockman family home.\nSaturday | 2100 - 2145 | BBC2\nQI XL\nThere\u2019s nothing else on so increase your general\nknowledge.\nSunday | 2100 - 2200 | BBC1\nSpooks\nThe last series of the BBC\u2019s spy drama continues\nMonday | Anytime | ITVPlayer\nDownton Abbey\nReally you should have watched it last night, but\nyou can watch it on ITVPlayer now!\nTuesday | 2100 - 2200 | BBC1\nThe Body Farm\nForensic thriller starring Tara Fitzgerald.

Some\nof you may already have heard about\nthese changes. However, there is a lot of\nrumour and innuendo \ufb02oating about, so\nI thought I would take this opportunity\nto clarify what the changes are and why\nwe\u2019ve had to make them.\nIn the past, we have run bar nights\nby selling kegs directly to the group\norganizing the night. These were sold at\njust above cost price, and the intention\nwas to give student groups a chance\nto give their members cheap drinks\nand raise some money for their club.\nHowever, this approach is no longer\nsustainable. Firstly, we were losing\nmoney every time a bar night was run, as\nthe keg price did not account for various\nMichael Foster\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\ndfps@imperial.ac.uk\nstaf\ufb01ng costs, including the (often quite\nsigni\ufb01cant) cleaning costs. Secondly,\nin order to comply with our new\nResponsible Retailing of Alcohol Code\nof Practice, we need to avoid practices\nthat encourage excessive drinking. As\nclubs were charged for any opened kegs,\nregardless of how much had been drunk,\nthis encouraged people to \ufb01nish off what\nremained, even if they had already had\ntoo much.\nInstead, we have come up with a system\nwhereby the price of drinks can be\nreduced, while making sure the bar night\ndoesn\u2019t lose money for either the Union\nor the club. Clubs can now order a bar\ntab at a 10% discount: this saving can\nbe passed on to club members or used\nas income for the club. The tab would\nthen normally be accessed with tokens\nprovided upon purchasing entry. With\nany bar night, there is now a limit on\nhow many free drinks come included,\nas stated by the Code of Practice \u2013 only\neight units (roughly four pints) can be\ngiven for free.\nWhen we sat down to update the policy,\nwe identi\ufb01ed cheaper beer and fundraising as the main reasons for running\na bar night (as well as the social aspect).\nWe therefore think that this idea allows\nclubs to ful\ufb01l one of these goals. It will be\ndif\ufb01cult to do both, as the sums don\u2019t add\nup, but we hope that this provides a way\nfor student groups to run bar nights in a\nsustainable way so that neither the Union\nnor the club loses out.\nSee more on this on my blog at\nimperialcollegeunion.org/blogs.\nChanges to the Bar Nights\nyour\nsabbaticals\nimperialcollegeunion.org/sabbs\nKeep up-to-date with your Sabbaticals at:\nYour Union starts with your year rep\nand ends with the President.\nimperialcollegeunion.org/elections\nYear Reps\nCouncil Members\n\u2022 Faculty of Engineering:\n4 x Undergraduate;\n3 x Postgraduate.\n\u2022 Faculty of Natural Sciences:\n4 x Undergraduate;\n1 x Postgraduate\n\u2022 Faculty of Medicine:\n2 x Undergraduate;\n1 x Postgraduate\n\u2022 Non-Faculty (eg.

The RCSU President explained that\nthey \u2018\u2019saw the chicken head carelessly tossed aside\non the Queen\u2019s Lawn\u201d, posed as freshers to distract the medic manning the RAG stall and took the\nmascot.\nHe continued that the medic mumbled, \u201cthat guy\njust stole our head\u201d and that they had to \u201cdodge\nseveral rugby lads\u201d to escape. It is claimed that the\nmedics, \u201cunable to understand the difference between Science and Engineering\u201d, went to the CGCU\noffice as their first port of call.\nICSMSU\u2019s President, Suzie Rayner, responded\nthat they are \u201chighly disappointed in the poor manner the head was stolen\u201d, adding that it has had\n\u201cenough abuse from non-medics at Varsity\u201d resulting in damage to its right eye. \u201cIt is questionable\nwhether this constitutes mascotry when they don\u2019t\nhave the full mascot\u201d. The RCSU\u2019s demands included a \u00a3200 donation to RCSU RAG, the ICSM President streaking in Beit Quad with only the Phoenix\nhead on and a department-wide email stating that\n\u201cRCSU is better than ICSMSU\u201d.\nDuring the Freshers\u2019 Fair, this medic-friendly reporter was targeted by medical students and the\nFelix Cat head was stolen. Although swiftly retrieved\nwith aid of the ICSMSU President, she sympathised\nbut commented \u201cthe medics have taken to stealing\nmascot heads in retaliation. No head is safe, as the\nFelix Cat discovered.\u201d\nUnion President Scott Heath describes mascotry\nas an \u201cadults\u2019 game of hide and seek\u201d aiming to\n\u201chumiliate those unable to protect their mascot\u201d\nand to \u201cgain a charitable contribution\u201d. The rules\nhave been historically laid out and the mascots are\nopen to theft by faculty unions only.\nAlex Karapetian\nI\nmperial College is a fantastic environment in which to study and most staff,\nvisitors and students will never experience crime whilst on the campus.\nHowever, some will and it is my job to\ndeter crime, provide crime prevention advice\nand investigate reported crimes, along with\nmy colleague Community Support Officer,\nPaul Stratford. Imperial College has an \u2018Open\ndoor\u2019 policy and some non-sensitive areas are\nunlocked during working hours and accessible\nto the public. This affords unhindered passage\nfor all but can attract criminals. Keeping your\nproperty with you at all times is probably the\nbest way of keeping them safe. I often walk\naround the campus and see laptop computers,\nmobile phones and bags left unattended, not\njust inside the buildings but also in the garden\nareas. The in-house security team are very effective at collecting these items and storing\nthem in the security office, but some are stolen.\nThis can lead to a complete loss of a student\u2019s\nwork, which can be devastating. The same\nadvice is pertinent to offices: if you keep your\nlaptop computer or digital camera in the office,\nensuring it is under lock and key is the best\nway of keeping it safe.\nIf you use your pass to enter a door, please\ncheck the identity of anyone following you\nin. They won\u2019t mind showing you their pass\nif they are genuine. There have been instances\nrecently when students have assisted someone entering a restricted area by opening the\ndoor for them. The person they let through was\nthere to steal property. Don\u2019t be the one to let\nthem in.\nThere have been some recent incidents when\nstudents have been stopped by people in plain\nclothes pretending to be police officers. The\nstudents have been searched and made to hand\nover property. If a police officer stops you\nand shows you a police warrant card, please\ncheck the following: the warrant card wallet\nis black. Inside the wallet is a silver badge on\nthe left with a small slip of silver metal which\nhas braille on it. A Metropolitan Police warrant\ncard (left) is blue, white and red. The words\n\u2018POLICE OFFICER\u2019 are at the top printed in\nRed. If you are unsure dial 999 or get someone to dial it for you and ask for the police.\nThey will confirm if the person is a real police\nofficer. The police will never ask you for PIN\nnumbers for bank cards, you should never reveal these to anyone.\nYou can security mark your property, or\nregister it on the Immobilise website (www.\nimmobilise.com). If you would like help or\ninformation about this, please contact me.\nIf you would like to contact me directly, in\nconfidence, for advice, information or to arrange a talk for a group, please email police@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nPC Nigel Lewis is the Imperial College Police\nOfficer. He is part of the Knightsbridge & Belgravia Safer Neighbourhood Team based at\nBelgravia Police Station.\nWarning over campus thefts\nPC Nigel Lewis reports on college security concerns\nFelix Summer Ball survey results reveal students\u2019 concerns with event\n\u201cErrrm...where were all the people?\u201d was one of\nthe many questions asked after last year\u2019s Summer Ball. With less than half the expected turnout and a 6-figure loss, it will come as no surprise that the initial results of the Felix survey are\nlooking rather bleak.\nAs Felix reported previously the Summer Ball\ngenerated the largest loss in recent memory, with\nthe key cause involving high expenditure on musical acts and a low turnout. The Union claimed\nthat there were \u201cmany unforeseen circumstances\nthat contributed to the lower than expected income\u201d. The Union also stated that the loss would\nnot significant impact on the Union\u2019s activities.A\nstatement which Michael Foster, this year\u2019s Deputy President for Finance and Services stands by.\nThe Felix survey confirms that there were indeed many reasons for the lack of attendance, a\nfrequent complaint being the price of the ticket\nand what students perceived they would be getting for it:\n\u201cWaste of money for something that didn\u2019t\nseem value for money\u201d, \u201cI didn\u2019t see the Summer Ball as value for money, \u00a340-45 for the festival set-up where food wasn\u2019t even provided? No\nchance.\u201d These were both anonymous comments\nposted by Imperial students in the survey.\nA lot of complaints were directed towards the\nfestival format, a change from previous years,\nwhich angered many students, in particular those\nin their final year. \u201c...It sounds like it wasn\u2019t\nmuch of a ball, just standing in a crowd in the\nrain wearing normal clothes?! To celebrate the\nend of our time at Imperial, we don\u2019t really want\nbig-name bands. We can go to a music festival\nfor that. The summer ball should be about having\na special evening with our friends, celebrating\nand dancing\u201d suggesting that the Union \u201cshould\njust get a DJ, make the tickets more like \u00a320-25\n(or otherwise include dinner) and ask people to\nwear formal clothes.\u201d\nOther complaints included that the event was\n\u201ctoo spread out\u201d, the \u201cmusic catered to a minority of people\u201d and the timing, with some undergraduates still working towards exams when the\nBall took place. Expressed in true Imperial style,\nthis student maintained, \u201cRevision must take priority\u201d.\nHowever there was also some positive feedback to be found in the survey results such as\nthe performances by Nero and Chase & Status,\nwhich were much appreciated in the Great Hall.\nAlso many students were very satisfied with the\nprices of food and drink on the day, adding that\nthe \u201cfree funfair rides were genius\u201d.\nThe mixed reactions for the Summer Ball raises questions as to how the Union will take the\nfeedback on board and organise this year\u2019s event.\nMichael Foster stated that the Union has \u201cnot\nmade any decisions regarding the 2012 Summer\nBall yet\u201d, including whether to collaborate with\nother universities again. Afull report with the financial breakdowns will be provided to Council\nin due course.\nDeepka Rana\nCommon complaints centre around format change, though funfair is praised\nAlex Karapetian\nThe Union has \u201cnot made\nany decisions regarding\nthe 2012 Summer Ball\nyet\u201d\nA genuine police warrant card with\nimprinted braille\nICSMSU President Suzie Rayner, powerless to\nretrieve the mascot head from the RCSU office\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\n26\nClubs, Socs & Projects\nFELIX\nFriday 07 OCTOBER 2011\nT\nhe 18th century French philosopher Denis Diderot once said\n\u2018Only passions, great passions,\ncan elevate the soul to great\nthings.\u2019\nI have never been one to attach much importance to helping others. Being an only child, I\nnever had the time to think whether life was\ntreating others as fairly as it did me. There\nhave been times when I was known to scorn\nthose who did not do as well as their counter-parts.\nHowever, all that changed when I had the\nchance to meet some amazing people last year\nduring fundraising events, such as collections\nfor the Pakistan flood victims and bone marrow\ntransplant for young children. The media give\nbut brief glimpses of the sadness that prevails\noutside our comfort zones.\nIt was not long before I realised that a person\ncould not survive in this world alone. That was\nhow my passion for community service came\ninto existence. I a extremely pleased to say that\nthis passion has brought about a great change in\nme \u2013 a change that I shall proudly carry throughout my life.\nArecent documentary, aired on Channel 4, discussed the Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka. The Sri\nLankan Government and The Liberation Tigers\nof Tamil Eelam were at war, with the innocent\nTamil civilians stuck in between. Seeing mothers sitting on dirty floors, clasping little babies\nto their bosoms, whilst crying out for mercy, was\nappalling. The footages showing women corpses\nbeing sexually abused were abhorrent to anyone\nviewing the documentary.\nAfter watching this, I really felt for the Tamil\ncivilians. The war ended more than two years\nago, but the wounds are still fresh. I used social\nnetworking websites to get in touch with Tamils, who could provide me more information on\nthe issue and also advise me how I could be of\nany help. Through this, I learnt about the Tamil\nAid Charity, whose main focus was constructing\nschools for Tamil children in Sri Lanka. By then,\nI had the basic idea in mind: taking part in an\nactivity to raise money for the TamilAid charity.\nDuring this time, it was the Holy month of Ramadan. My perception of Ramadan was a test\nof patience and a feel for how the poor people\nlived. Keeping this in mind, I decided to participate in a 10 km run, whilst fasting, to raise\nmoney for the Tamil Aid charity.\nDeciding on a beautiful 9.4 km Aberdeen\nbeach circuit, the next step was to create a page\non Just Giving and on Facebook. That was all\nstraightforward. The harder bits were yet to\ncome \u2013 how exactly is a person, out of shape like\nmyself, supposed to run 10 km \u2013 whilst fasting?\nNeedless to say, I had to devise a proper plan\nto execute the task successfully. Going in straight\nfor the run, without practising, would have been\nsuicidal; especially since I had little more than\na week to train myself to develop the required\nstamina to survive the run. My training programme consisted of two parts, stamina building\nand following a high carbohydrate diet. I found\nit very hard to leave all the scrumptious Indian\ncurries behind, and instead eat large amounts of\npasta, rice, tuna and energy bars. The training\nconsisted of three sets of runs, two 3 km and one\n5 km. This had to be done on alternate days, just\nbefore sunset, so I could finish my run in time to\nbreak my fast.\nThe one thing I looked forward to everyday\nwas that one sip of water, which I would break\nmy fast with after the training. Meanwhile, I updated my statuses on social networking websites\nto collect the donations. After sending almost\n600 text messages and writing on 500 peoples\u2019\nFacebook profiles individually, I almost touched\nmy target of \u00a31,000.\nFriday, 26th August 2011, the big day had finally come. It wasn\u2019t until 6pm that I headed to\nan open field near the chosen beach circuit for\nwarm up. By 7pm, I was at the start line, all set\nand ready to go. The weather was sunny \u2013 a real\ngift inAberdeen. Setting off and pacing up, I was\nlucky to have a cool breeze! Contending with an\nFast times for charity\nunplanned incline at the halfway point , I had\nto reduce my speed to a jog and take a break. I\ncontinued running, whilst shuffling through the\nmusic playlist on my iPod \u2013 completing the final\nsection quicker than expected. To my surprise, I\nwas back at the starting point \u2013 I had completed\nthe circuit!\nIncluding my jog back home, I had run 10.2\nkm in just over an hour, including three short\nbreaks. It was not over yet of course \u2013 I had to\nwait for half an hour for sunset, before I could\nbreak my fast. Later that evening, I went to a local restaurant for a feast.\nI had successfully managed to cross my target\nof \u00a31,000. I was glad to have taken the initiative\nof raising money for the Tamil Aid charity, as I\nam sure that the money will serve the Tamil children well. We may come from different back-grounds, races or religions, but the one thing all\nof us have in common is a heart, which beats 72\ntimes a minute.\nHamza Shaikh undertakes a unique challenge during\nRamadan in order to raise money for Sri Lankan schools\nAnjana Dua\nUthishtan Ranjan\nSyed Mohammad Maimoon\nVinod Motiani\nMohammad Danish\nLalithaa Rhaasa\nGayathri Rajasooriar\nKhushboo Khatri\nSanjiv Sharma\nHui Koay\nJoel Mon\nRaavaniya Pararajasingam\nSam Lishak\nAdeel Malik\nArif Rahman\nJennifer Caren Lenz\nAnish Chavda\nIrham Usman\nAbdul Patel\nAaron Pereira\nVar Hansen\nThirukumaran Maheswaran\nZara Hason\nSam Cooper\nMidhat Talibi\nHeinrich Lohner\nAhmad Zuberi\nMasuda Shaikh\nPatricia Shaikh\nSuliaman Malik\nIbad Rizvi\nOmar Ahmed\nTsegab Getachew\nJasdeep Sahota\nRodrigo Pracana\nAamir Shamsi\nMubeen Ahmed\nFatima Ahmad\nAmardeep Legha\nDipam Patel\nIsha Puri\nOmer Aziz\nIqra Bilal\nMohammad Hassan Khan\nAnas Imtiaz\nAbhijit Chandgadkar\nAislinn Hayes\nSayinthen Vivekanantham\nKishwer Aziz\nIbrahim Shaikh\nRaj Gandhi\nSing Kwan Ng\nHarshil Palan\nEscapeda Saamy\nNader Kaheil\nJodie Mitchell-Aziz\nAli Hammad\nSohail Azhar\nMarko Krznaric\nAslam Aziz\nKhalid Shaikh\nHassan Al Halwachi\nAdya Jha\nKaran Murugavel\nIndy Kanthasamy\nSuhail Khalid\nHussain Cheema\nHashem Cheema\nSaad Mughal\nSubbiah Thannirmalai\nMaria Qurashi\nUmair Aasem\nUsman Siddiqui\nWelcome to the Clubs & Societies section!

Some people will use this\ntactic unknowingly when their religious\nbeliefs are called into question, especially when the question posed is: \u201cAre\nyou a theist or an atheist?\u201d The secret,\nthird option in this case is agnosticism,\nwhich, in the case of this question, is a\nnonsensical answer.\nThe irrelevance of such a response\nto the question posed is something that\noften goes unnoticed and unchallenged.\nOf course, agnosticism as a concept has\nno intrinsic connection to the question\nof the existence of God, and can be defined only as \u201cnot knowing\u201d. It in fact\nrelates to an entirely separate dilemma,\nforming one half of another dichotomy\nwith \u201cGnosticism\u201d.\nThe truth is the distinction between\natheism and theism leaves no room for\na middle ground. Not even the most\nskilled of verbal contortionists can slide\nthemselves between the two without ignoring the most basic rules of the English language. A thorough understanding of the terms at hand is at the crux\nof the issue and, when achieved, forces\nthose who have previously dismissed\nthe choice to come down on either side\nof the non-existent fence, on which they\nhave been previously content to sit.\nA \u201ctheist\u201d is someone who believes\nthat a God (or Gods) exists. Definitions\nwill occasionally include the belief that\nthe universe was created by this God\n(or these Gods), although such additions are superfluous to this discussion.\nThe concept of theism is, in general,\nwell understood and is not the primary\nsource of confusion as far as this issue\ngoes. That mantle is taken up by atheism in almost every case. The prefix \u201ca\u201d\nis of Greek origin, and denotes an absence of, a lack of, or simply \u201cnot\u201d. Taking this into consideration, it must be\nconceded that atheism is not a belief, as\nit is so often professed to be. It is merely\na lack of belief. It is nothing other than\nan absence of theism.\nThe fact that we even have a word for\nthis kind of disbelief is simply a sign of\nthe historical prevalence of the belief in\nthe existence of a deity, and is nothing\nother than a direct consequence of the\nfact that belief in God itself commands\nits own label. The reason that we do not,\nfor example, have a word for disbelief\nin the existence of less popular beliefs,\nsuch as unicorns, Bigfoot, fairies, or\nany other fantastical creature that you\ncan care to imagine, which, by the way,\ncould easily be believed on nothing\nother than \u201cfaith\u201d, is simply the result\nof the absence of the word for positive\nbelief in these things (you may argue\nthat \u201cstupid\u201d may suffice in each case).\nWithout theism, no one would be labeled an atheist.\nA more useful question than the one\nI asked in the first paragraph would\nperhaps be: \u201cAre you a theist?\u201d If you\nanswer in anything other than the af-firmative, you are an atheist, and this\nincludes those who \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. This\nis the point at which agnostics have a\nchoice to make. The choice is not, how-ever, between two viewpoints. There is\nonly one viewpoint to consider.\nIf you do not identify with theism, you\nare an atheist. The separate question of\nGnosticism opens up a long and arduous\ndebate, which requires confrontation of\nmany contentious issues pertaining to\nthe meaning of knowledge and our ability to acquire it. I often find that agnosti-ATrue Dichotomy\ncism is a rather useless term to include\nin discussions due to these contentions.\nThis discussion, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be relieved to hear, is for another day.\nYou could well be an \u201cagnostic theist\u201d,\nwhich would mean you have a belief in\nGod, but do not claim to \u201cknow\u201d that a\nGod exists. Be that as it may, I would\nhazard a guess that the label \u201cagnostic\natheist\u201d would in fact best describe most\nagnostics. This would satisfactorily illustrate a state of not knowing whether a\nGod exists and believing that we cannot\npossibly know either way, or, as you so\noften hear, a state of mind in which the\nsubject \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about the question enough to have a belief about it.\nThe key thing to recognise, in my\nopinion, is the discrepancy between two\nissues that are only loosely related: one\nabout belief, and one about knowledge.\nThis means that agnosticism is indeed\na viable position, but you must not fall\ninto the trap of thinking that this answers the main question about the belief\nin a God. As an agnostic non-theist, you\nmay be reluctant to associate yourselves\nwith the group that all have two horns\nand a tail, but don\u2019t let this reluctance\nor any social stereotype get in the way\nof what is the plain and irrefutable truth.\nAn atheist you are.\nDon\u2019t find yourself stuck in No-Man\u2019s Land\nSam Horti\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nAt the World Championship Adam was arrested for indecent exposure\n\u201c \u201d\nIf you answer in anything other\nthan the affirmative, you are\nan atheist, and this includes\nthose who \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d.\nEarlier this month it was revealed that Imperial College London had slipped eleven\nplaces in the Sunday Times University\nLeague Table for 2012. With such a dramatic fall from third to fourteenth position\nnationally, this is undoubtedly a cause for\nconcern.\nYet if one considers the latest results\nfrom the Times Higher Education World\nUniversity Rankings, released yesterday,\nImperial finds itself in comfortable territory.\nThe university currently sits in eight position globally, and takes third place nation-ally, behind Oxford and Cambridge. Clearly,\nthere is disparity between not only these\nleague tables, but also many others.\nIf it is a case of UK-only league tables\nplacing a greater emphasis on student\nopinions, as stated by the Union President\nlast month, then should we even be paying\nattention to world rankings and drawing attention to our significant success while they\nfail to fully gauge the university experience?\nNaturally, league tables are not to be\nbalked at, though at their heart a great\ngap is widening \u2013 that of consistency. As\nit stands, prospective students eager to\nassess the merits of individual universities are invariably swayed by the allure of\nleague tables. The varying ranks of universities such as Imperial across a variety of\nwell researched though contrasting tables\ncan easily serve to complicate and hinder\npotential applications.\nEqually, the sudden drop of an institution\nsuch as Imperial with comparison to other,\nperhaps more favourable league table re-sults, may lower the credibility of such tables in the eyes of the reader.\nThe Union President\u2019s pledge to work\nwith the College to improve student satisfaction as a result of the sudden fall must\nbe welcomed. Any attempt to improve the\nadmittedly poor results of this year\u2019s National Student Survey (Imperial stands at\n163rd out of 168 UK institutes with regards\nto student satisfaction) will obviously reap\nthe benefits.\nNevertheless, the league tables system\nis inherently confusing and when the future\nof your own higher education is at stake,\nclarity is precisely what is needed. Separate tables do serve a purpose of providing\ngenuine comparison between institutions,\nthough it is dangerous to place full trust in\ntheir varying criteria or conditions.\nThere is no denying that Imperial has a\nproblem with student satisfaction that\nit must attempt to tackle; equally, there\nneeds to be a firm examination of the\nleague table process, before they become\nan arbitrary ranking wholly dependent on\npublication.\nFELIX\nJust how important are\nleague tables?\n\u201c\n\u201d\nThe concept of the-ism.. is not the primary\nsource of confusion\n\n"

So now Snowsports\nclubs from across the land of London\nhave come together to bring snowy\nfun to the masses (i.e. you) at good ol\u2019,\npre-tuition-fee-scandal, student prices!\nWhile you were busy working on those\ntans that the days of revision and exams\ndenied you, your lovely Snowsports\ncommittee were looking out for your\nwinter needs.\nAs the summer ends we are pleased to\nannounce the formation of another hybrid word and a new era of: the London\nSnowoperative! What does it mean?\nThis winter\u2019s trip will be the biggest\nyet with Greenwich, University of Arts\nLondon, Southbank University and Ravensbourne College joining Imperial in\na fleet of coaches all going to Les Arcs,\nFrance. Combining the trip in this way\nhas lead to a reduced cost that doesn\u2019t\ncompromise on resort location or quality of service.\nWhat\u2019s more, now that October has\ncome and the weather is shite again,\nyou can look forward to meeting other\nLondon students on Snowsports socials:\non our trips to snow domes and as we\ntravel to competitions including the\nweekend trip to Edinburgh in November (aka BUDS). To welcome this new\nSnowoperative into action Imperial will\nbe hosting a We Are Metric night (Octo-ber 20). \u201cOn this night we invite anyone\nthat has ever wanted to ski or snowboard to join us in celebrating this new\nventure!\u201d Gerry Hawkins, Social Secretary, shared. \u201cEveryone else come for\nthe fun times and free beverage,\u201d added\nthe trip\u2019s organiser Vlad Demerdzhiev,\n\u201cenjoy this one responsibly \u2013 the rest is\nup to you.\u201d\nWikipedia teaches us that a cooperative is \u201can autonomous association of\npersons united voluntarily to meet their\ncommon economic, social, and cultural\nneeds and aspirations through jointly\nowned and democratically controlled\nenterprise.\u201d The Snowoperative will\nalso strive to meet your snow-related\nneeds and aspirations. Be they learning\nto ski or board, or landing rodeo fives\n- or if you just want to make an igloo\nand join in the apr\u00e8s-ski. For example,\nthe fresher taster session (October 19)\nwill also be joint with the Snowoperative with two coaches of students heading to Milton Keynes\u2019 snow dome for\nrecreational ski with features or a lesson\navailable at a huge discount.\nThe Snowoperative is thus far composed of the core five universities \u2013\nhowever others have already expressed\ninterest and growth is expected next\nyear. \u201cThis is a sport which is not all\nabout the rivalry but the revelry,\u201d explained Luke Bridgestock \u2013 Freestyle\nCaptain and PhD student, \u201cThis is the\nstart of something special that will continue on.\u201d\nPrices for the annual winter trip to\nthe alpine mountains had been increasing year on year. As always the aim has\nbeen to make the trip as affordable as\npossible so that it is not only attended\nby the super keen (gnarly, power-hun-gry specimens that you are) but also by\nthose that want to keep the recreational\nstudent life going over winter. It is a\ntime to bond over vin chaud and have\nsilly fun with other students in the snow.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not long until our holidays\nwill be limited by our careers and student prices are snatched away from us!\nLondon snowsports clubs needed to\nunite and do some serious negotiating!\nMatt Edwards, treasurer, assures us that\nthe Snowoperative efforts have been\nsuccessful: \u201cThis year, the trip costs less\nthan last year and the year before that.\u201d\nThe most significant change the Snowoperative trip will bring Imperial\nstudents is the variety of social oppor-tunities. Of course, being the independent adults that you are \u2013 it\u2019s up to you\nwhat you choose to get involved in. If\nyou want to keep it a personal trip with\nfriends, that is still possible. Accommodation will remain as self catered, apartment rooms to give you a base. Les Arcs\noffers a huge skiing area to explore and\nyou can enjoy the freedom however you\nlike. On the flipside, if your aim is to get\nto know new people then there will be a\nrange of events to attend in the coming\nmonths: union nights like We Are Metric, weekend trips away (BUDS), premieres of ski and snowboarding films,\nthe chance to try out racing for free and\nmore. This year will be unlike any year\nImperial has ever seen \u2013 the world of\nSnowsports is opening up to everyone.\nSnowsports clubs collaboration will \u2018reduce prices\u2019\nElisabeth Burks\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10 10\n11 12 13\n13 14 15 15 16\n17 18 18 19 19 20\n21\n20 21 22 23 24\n24 26 25 27\n26 29\n11 12 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26 23\n25\n28\n22\n17\n17\n14\n16\nAll kitted out: Imperial athletes show off the new college threads in front of Ethos,where a Kukri shop selling official kit has\nbeen set up.

Personally, I don\u2019t see food as a main\nsource of energy only. The enjoyment of eating is\nprobably the main aspect of a good quality of life.\nIn other words, being able to eat what you want,\nwhen you want it at your favourite place, makes\nyou feel good and satisfied.\nIn our society, food is the king of entertaining,\ncelebrating and connecting. All of us have turned\nto food at one time or another for comfort, to help\nus cope with stressful experiences and bad emo-tions, and to satisfy desires.\nHave you ever noticed the strong relationship\nbetween memory and food? The taste and smell\nof food are able to flash memories of past food-related events and activities in our lives. For me,\nhaving egg and lemon soup with chicken, reminds\nme of some Easters with family and it momentarily\nbrings me closer to home.\nTherefore, feel free to share with us any food experiences that you find important and make sure\nthat you put food in its proper place in your life.\nIt does make a significant difference to your life-style, mood and health.\nDiwali Festival\nThis year Dishoom, the Bombay Caf\u00e9 in Covent\nGarden, celebrates the wonderful stories behind\nthe Hindu festival of light (Diwali) presenting a deli-cious, celebratory Diwali feast menu that starts on\nthe 18th October and lasts until October 30.\nVegetarians will swoon over the Phaldari Kofta\nRuby, a dish of dumplings stuffed with vegetables,\npaneer and pomegranate; and the Diwali Biryani,\nslow-cooked and layered with winter vegetables\nand aromatic rice encased in a dough purdah - all\nfor just \u00a322.50 per person.\nAnother choice is the much-loved Dishoom\ngrilled Lobster tail, cooked with ginger, chilli, lime\nand coriander followed by the Chicken Berry Biryani - for \u00a327.50 per person. Both feasts are served\nwith Dahi Puri - mini puffed bread shells with chickpeas and yoghurt and flavoured with tamarind,\ncooling raita, a choice of freshly prepared breads\nand Dishoom\u2019s signature slow-cooked house black\ndaal.\nDesserts include a choice of a Gola ice or Kulfi,\nfollowed by the House Chai. Diners will also receive complimentary mithai, traditional Indian\nsweets, as part of the festivities.\nAre you tempted enough?\narrive with an 8-inch diameter cake by midday on Sunday October 16.\nExcept from the above, there are many more\nevents organized by the participants. If you\nhave a passion for chocolates or you simply\nwant to see something different, then the following events may be of great interest to you.\nFirstly, the week starts with La Maison Du\nChocolat Luxury Tasting experience, at 15:00\non October 8 at La Maison du Chocolat bou-tique, in Piccadilly. There you will trace the\nsteps of the creation of chocolate from the\nharvesting of the fruit from the cacao tree,\nto the creation of chocolates with refined in-gredients.

After coming\nacross a voluble witness to a murder (who\nhimself is already dead), Grant is plunged into\nthe magical and twisted underside of the city\nand apprenticed (in more ways than one) to\nEngland\u2019s last wizard, Inspector Nightingale.\nTogether they must attempt to hunt down a\nvengeful spirit that threatens to bring chaos to\nthe city whilst avoiding the wrath of varying\nChief Constables.\nThis book has such potential that it is hard\nto accept it as what it is; a light hearted,\nwell-plotted, well-written adventure story.\nThe problem lies in a lack of exposition; the\ntitular \u2018rivers\u2019 are the god\u2019s and goddesses of\nthe Thames, a wonderful idea sorely lacking\nin any pursuance. A few brief historical allusions to the more obscure subterranean rivers\nare never expounded upon, so that the reader\nfinds himself in the awkward position of wishing for just a little more. Yes, there are vampire\nnests in Purley and graves in Covent Garden\nand improbable names all round, central London wonderfully evoked as it rushes by, but so\nlittle is explained it is infuriating.\nThe central plot is well carried off and certainly enjoyable, but so much more is dangled\nin front of the reader and then snatched away;\nthe sequel is almost worth buying simply on\nthe off chance the motivations and histories of\ncertain characters are.

On one hand, mushrooms are heterotrophs: they do not make their\nown food, not unlike many students, in fact.\nHowever, unlike students, they are clearly not\nanimals and are apparently healthy. They also\nhave an uncanny resemblance to plants with\nthe classic \u201cstalk-coming-out-of-the-groundwith-stuff-on-top\u201d design that\u2019s been in vogue\nfor the past 200 million years or so.\nWhen the College\u2019s resident biologists were\nconfronted with this dilemma it forced a rethink of what a mushroom actually is, and after some debate involving the arguments of\n\u201ccome on\u201d and \u201cit\u2019ll be jokes\u201d, a vote was\npassed in an office somewhere in SAF, though\nwhether the wider scientific community will\nrecognise this remains to be seen. Preliminary\nspeculation suggests a response along the\nlines of \u201cyou must be fucking joking\u201d.\nOne unexpected consequence of this is that\nthis precedent has opened up the possibility\nof addressing other discrepancies in the English language regarding fruit and vegetables.\nCurrently the tomato is a fruit even though it\nfinds its way into clearly savoury dishes; yet\nneither the strawberry nor Matt Berry are considered true berries, despite their misleading\nnames and being rather seedy. Putting these\nin more appropriate groups would at the very\nleast give Alan Davies a couple fewer things\nto trip up over on QI.\nDesigners Brad and Chad are sitting in the Apple boardroom. They are joined by the blue-sky\nthinker, and marketing guru, Clint. He is walking around barefoot, thinking about his game\nof hacki-sack later, and thinking about a lovely\npair of hemp shorts he saw recently. They are\njoined by the electrical engineer Wallace, who\nis currently slightly annoyed that he has had to\ninterrupt a lovely dream he was having about\nelectrons. Let\u2019s just say, they were penetrating\nevery part of his body.\nBrad: Urgh, man, we have to design another\niPhone already.\nChad: Yeah, I know it sucks \u2013 well we better\nget on with it.\nBrad: I bet you we could just sell people the\nsame phone twice.\nChad: What? No way. How do you plan to do\nthat?\nBrad: I don\u2019t know exactly, but with our customers it\u2019s definitely possible. I\u2019ll ask Clint.\nHey Clint, Clint, CLINT. Good, got your atten-tion. Any chance you could move your beanbag a bit closer?\nClint: Sorry, the energy is just about right in\nthis area. (Wallace snorts in disguist)\nBrad: Fantastic, sounds completely plausible,\nanyway, do you reckon we could basically just\nrelaunch our iPhone 4 and pretend it\u2019s new?\nMaybe add a feauture?\nClint: It\u2019s possible. Adding a truly new feature\nwould break up the harmony though (Wallace\nstarts grumbling). It would be better if you\ntook a feature no one uses that the product currently has and made it better.\nChad: How about that whole voice command\nshit.\nBrad: Yeah, that\u2019s perfect. I\u2019ve never used it.\nIt\u2019s not like anyone can ever test it outside on\nthe streets as if it fails we can say it was due to\nbackground noise.\nChad: Plus it\u2019s not like everyone\u2019s going to\nwalk around talking to their iPhone asking it\nto call someone \u2013 they\u2019d look like a complete\nbell-end.\nBrad: And it\u2019s quicker to just do it yourself\nanyway.\nClint: I\u2019m really getting a good vibe here vis\u00e0-vis the birthing process.\nWallace: Shouldn\u2019t we fix the fact that it keeps\ndropping calls?\nBrad: We\u2019re not at fucking Nokia now Wallace; we\u2019re innovating right now.\nClint: From a marketing point of view, we can\nfix the problem and then announce it as if it\u2019s a\nmassive achievement that a phone can receive\nand make calls.\nBrad: Perfect, all the fans will love it. They\u2019ll\nthink we\u2019re listening to them and fixing a\nproblem!\nChad: We can\u2019t just do that though; we also\nneed to add in a slightly better camera and a\nminutely higher resolution screen. Is that even\npossible? Wallace, quick question for you man\n\u2026 stop writing, redrafting and then ultimately\nnot sending Facebook chat messages to all the\nwomen in the office you like.\nWallace: Hey, she liked one of my photos. I\u2019m\nso in. Ah, she went offline; next time I\u2019ll DEFINITELY say hi. And, yeah, of course we can.\nShouldn\u2019t we design something new though?\nClint: No, this is innovation by stagnation,\nsome people cannot see as far as others. We\ndefinitely need to release it in both black and\nwhite. That will guarantee our success.\nChad: Brad and I will go away and brain-storm, we\u2019ll come back when finished \u2026 30\nminutes later \u2026\nBrad: So, here\u2019s the new design.\nClint: Right. Brainwave people. I\u2019m going to\nmarket it as having 200 new features. It\u2019s not\nas if anyone will ever search them all out. We\ncan claim minor changes are actually bone fide\nnew features. See that pixel you changed from\ngrey to darker grey on the bar at the bottom.\nThey all go out. Wallace is unhappy, as he\nwants to actually completely redesign everything from scratch rather than just tell people\nthey are. The week after, they show Tim Cook.\nTim Cook: What the fuck? Are you guys\ntrying to make me look shitty or something?\nBollocks to announcing this, I\u2019m letting some\nother poor bastards do that.\nHow the iPhone 4S was desigined ...\nThe magic mushroom taking community welcomed the move, saying \u201cHello\ntalking dog, I like your purple tail.\u201d\nDRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK\nHey losers, you haven\u2019t sent any in.\nWhat the fuck have you been doing \u2013\nrevising in the library or something?\nSend your photos to felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nAsk if it\u2019s okay first.

This year\u2019s festivities included a full line up\nof bands and DJs as well as fete-themed entertain-ments.\nSilfest 2011 supported the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT),\nin particular their Chiltern Chalk Grassland Project.\nThe project concerns the management of the increasingly rare habitat of chalk grassland.\nWith an original target to buy one cow to help\ngraze chalk grassland sites, the amount of money\nraised from the festival led to the purchase of two\ncows instead.\nTwo of Silfest 2011\u2019s organisers, Rosie Burdon\nand Mark Ramsden, hailed the event as a \u201cmassive\nsuccess\u201d.\n\u201cA capacity crowd of 500 people rocked up to see\n12 bands and 3 DJ\u2019s \u2026 from 12pm until 4am the\nnext morning. The pick of the bands were Kentish\nFire, the fantastic headliners Alphabet Backwards,\nThe Winter Olympics, and our very own MSc Men\nand Late Night Munchies.\u201d Matt Colvin\nFELIX\nNEWS\nFriday 07 OCTOBER 2011\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial has dropped a stunning 11 places\nin the Sunday Times League Table for 2012\nentry, published last month. The College is\nnow ranked fourteenth in the UK, behind institutions such as the University of Exeter and\nNewcastle University. This is the first time in\nfourteen years that Imperial has not been in the\ntable\u2019s top four. This drop has been attributed\nto a change in the methodology of compiling\nthe table, which has also seen King\u2019s College\nLondon slide from tenth to seventeenth place\nand the University of Edinburgh from fourteenth to twenty-seventh.\nThe table no longer considers universities\u2019\nstudent/staff ratios, instead giving greater\nweighting to the results of the National Student\nSurvey (NSS) and the number of students unemployed six months after graduation. Graduate employment now contributes up to 200\npoints to each institution\u2019s score and the first\n12 NSS questions; relating to \u201cthe teaching\non [the] course\u201d, \u201cassessment and feedback\u201d\nand \u201cacademic support\u201d; contribute up to 250\npoints. Out of the 168 institutions participating\nin the NSS Imperial is ranked 102nd, 163rd\nand 130th in each category respectively.\nUniversities can also gain up to 50 points\nor lose up to 55 points depending on answers\nto question 22, relating to overall satisfaction.\nWhile the overall weighting given to the NSS\nis greater than last year the answers to questions 13-21, concerning \u201corganisation and\nmanagement\u201d, \u201clearning resources\u201d and \u201cpersonal development\u201d are no longer considered.\nEach University can receive up to 1207 points,\nwith Imperial receiving 832 and Cambridge,\nwhich is ranked number one, receiving 1004.\nOther league tables have also seen a drop for\nImperial. Nationally it has been ranked tenth\nby the Guardian (down from seventh) and\nfourth by the Times Good University Guide\n(down from third for the first time ever).\nThe College has, however, gone up from\nseventh to sixth place in the QS World University Rankings, which take less account of\nstudent satisfaction than the UK tables. In ad-dition, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2011-2012, published yester-day, have seen Imperial rise to eight position\nglobally \u2013 up from ninth last year.\nUnion President Scott Heath has called the\ndrop in the rankings \u201cworrying\u201d. In his official\nblog Heath writes that the Union is taking the\nsituation very seriously and that he is drafting\na document, due to be released on Monday\n10 October, that will outline what \u201cshould be\ndone to increase student satisfaction\u201d. He has\nalready called for the College to produce \u201cnew\nguidelines to improve the pace of feedback\nacross the board\u201d and work to improve participation in the Student On-Line Evaluation\nStudent satsfaction hits tables\n(SOLE) as well as the NSS. He has also urged\n\u201cthe College to roll out our recommendations\nuniversally; as opposed to allowing each Faculty to individually uptake changes at different\npaces\u201d and to treat \u201cstudents as colleagues, not\nas customers\u201d.\nHeath, however, admitted that the Union also\nhas a large part to play. It has already begun\nto restructure \u201cthe Representation & Welfare\nBoard, in order to facilitate the sharing of best\npractice, bring issues to the Union\u2019s attention\nmore rapidly and provide a better forum for\ndiscussion\u201d. The Union will also advise the\nCollege \u201con how to better provide Feedback\u201d\nand will contact the other \u201cRussell Group Student Unions to see what systems they have\nimplemented\u201d. Heath hopes that these actions\n\u201cwill bring into place better student satisfaction and help restore our University to the rank\nit fully deserves in the UK tables\u201d.\nNew emphasis on NSS sees Imperial fall 11 places\nMaciej Matuszewski\nThis year\u2019s Silfest committee\nMatt Colvin Sean Gallagher\nA birds eye view of the South Kensington campus\n\n"

Result of the\nafternoon: no casualties, Tom Cotton\nlearnt how to ride a bike and Ed Jinks\nreally does love kebabs.\nTired and thirsty, we travelled back\nup north again to be greeted with a\nBBQ by our hosts.After enjoying their\nhospitality for an hour or two, we were\nsurprised to see Tom Godfrey making\nhis way towards the club house. Apparently, we had lost him in Berlin but\nhis impeccable knowledge of the German underground got him back safely.\nAfter more socializing and \u201cintercultural exchange\u201d awe took over our\n\u201caccommodation\u201d \u2013 some luxurious\ntents on a beach rugby pitch next to the\nactual rugby pitch. The night brought\nthe aforementioned English weather\nbut luckily, the tents were able to keep\nus dry. Being engineers, we decided to\nmake our upcoming nights more comfortable by buying some air mattresses\nbefore heading over to the club house\nfor a fantastic breakfast \u2013 the secret to\nany success.\nThe weather didn\u2019t improve much,\nand even the late arrival of our inspirational leader and captain Niall couldn\u2019t\nbrighten the skies: it kept raining and\nit felt like it was getting colder and\ncolder throughout the day. That didn\u2019t\nstop us from showing off our Sevens\nskills during the pool stage of the\nRugby Union Sevens tournament. Our\nfirst opponent, the local Veltener Rugby Club, had no chance against some\nfierce defending and great running in\nattack so that an easy 31-0 win was recorded by tour secretary Toby Spittle.\nEven more tries were scored against\nthe U18s side of the hosts, the \u201cRU\nYoung Wolves\u201d, and the Swiss team\nRC Bombers Zug. The toughest match\nof the day was the last one against defending champions RK 03 Berlin who\njust finished 7th in the German first di-vision; the Bundesliga. Again, our defense was the corner stone of our suc-cess. Our two tries and one conversion\nwas too much for the Berliners who\nonly managed to score one try \u2013 12-7\nand first place in pool B for the C&G\nRFC \u2013 what a result!\nThe other pool was topped by the\nsecond RK 03 team followed by the\nhosts RU Hohen Neuendorf. That\nmeant we were to face the hosts in the\ncup semifinal on the following day. A\ndevious plan by the hosts meant that\nthey organized a players\u2019 party for\nSaturday night which we were quick\nto take advantage of. Our fancy dress\nfor the evening, Ancient Greeks, was\nadmired by the locals. The handover\nbetween current and future ICURFC\nclub captain, started an \u2018interesting\u2019\nevening that ended in the early hours\non Sunday.\nAfter another exceptional breakfast\non Sunday, we discovered that we already made it to the final because both\nRK 03 teams did not make it back to\nthe tournament on Sunday after having\na beer or two too many. That meant we\nwere to play the last match of the tournament against RU Hohen Neuendorf.\nNiall had problems finding enough\nplayers for the team after injuries and\nhangovers decimated our side. We employed one ringer in the form of one\nRK 03 player who joined us so that we\nwent into the Cup final with some op-timism.\nThe hosts showed us from the off\nthat they wanted to win in front of\ntheir own fans. They quickly went two\ntries up before our own resident German, Max Joachim, brought us back\ninto the game with a converted try\njust before half-time. Unfortunately,\nthe beers from Saturday night were\nholding us back a bit so that we didn\u2019t\nmanage to score any more points. The\nsecond place was celebrated with the\nships to bring in the funds that will\ngo towards success. A happy consequence of this was announced on\nMonday: Varsity will be free for all\nstudents this year. \u201cWe want to see if\nwe can fill the Stoop\u201d, said Mosley,\nreferring to the ground of the Harlequins team in Twickenham where the\nRugby Varsity Match will be played.\nThe other, much more visible,\nconsequence of Imperial\u2019s renewed\nsporting ambition is a new partnership with sportswear company Kukri.\nBeginning with this season, all sports\nclubs will be able to order a wide\nrange of sport-specific kit in Imperial\ncolours.\nThis also meant that the second\npart of the meeting on Monday was a\nfashion show in the sports hall. Some\nof the best looking sportsmen-and-women strutted down the catwalk\nin style (including my fellow editor\nDave Wilson) modelling everything\nfrom rugby to volleyball attire. Kukri\nare also producing Imperial hoodies\nand tracksuits as part of their leisure-wear range \u2013 which are on sale in\ntheir new shop in Ethos.\nAs a sports editor, all of this sounds\nvery promising \u2013 and Felix Sport\nhopes to bring you all the action every Friday on the back page. One last\nthing before I let you get on with your\nFriday afternoon: we need contribu-tors!

A lot of positive surprises were\nnoted on the pitch by strong performances of freshers Will Griffiths and\nSean Jordan who put in some fierce\nhits while winger Lukas Michalitsch\nwas able to practice his try celebra-tions. The dedication shown by all the\nplayers and the willingness to mingle\nwith the other teams and our hosts left\nthe Germans very impressed by the\nC&G RFC and new C&G RFC club\ncaptain Ed Jinks left Germany with\nan invitation to the 3rd Rugby Union\nSevens next year. We also won the\nprize for the best match shirts of the\ntournament.

Alright,\nit may be more accurately described as\na holiday in the sun, but as I lay there on\nmy sun/cell-bed, I couldn\u2019t help musing\nover the similarities.\nFor one thing: getting there. Tenerife\nis a little farther afield than Strangeways\nand Benidorm is more than a few stops\non from Broadmoor, but you still need\nto get there. Be it on an armoured bus\nwith the fug of resignation in the air or a\nBoeing 747 airplane where the disparate\nsmells of boiled sweets, sun cream and\nbaby vomit diffuse together, travelling\nis never a wholly delightful experience.\nOnce you arrive, nothing changes.\nAfter a bureaucratic check-in, you are\nshown to your room, which contains a\nbed and a bath and/or sink. Whether or\nnot you have the furnishing of a truly\nenlightened society such as tea-making\nAngry Geek\nRhys Davies\nAnother year of undue praise!\nAnd next to it, the\nmayonnaise \u2013 is that\ngenuine or have the\nguards\u2026 spat in your\nfood?\nFun in the Sun\ntake the form of a risky, risqu\u00e9 affair\nin the showers around a bar of soap or\nan ABBA tribute act in the lounge bar.\nTo this day, I don\u2019t know which is more\nhorrific.\nSome people patiently see out their\nsentence by reading a few books and\ndreaming a few dreams. Others try to\nobliterate themselves in brightly coloured alcohol and fast, meaningless\nsex*. Others become so institutionalised\nthat once they leave, normal life is so\nfrightening for them that they quickly\nreturn to the warm embrace of cosy fa-miliarity. Recidivism is as much a problem in Gran Canaria as it is in Belmarsh.\nVery few dare abscond from their im-prisonment. I was only able to escape\nand bring you this article by tunneling\nthrough the wall behind a poster of Rita\nHayworth.\n*Sex, in this usage, can include eve-ning-long games of Gin Rummy\nfacilities depends on your connections.\nYou will meet most of the other tourists/\nin-mates in the exercise yard. Whether\nsaid exercise involves a cheeky dip in\nthe pool or breaking rocks with your\nfists is up to your own individual tour\nrep/guv\u2019nor.\nIn both situations, you quickly lose\ntrack of time as the days blur into one\nrepetitive tableau. Your only way of\nmarking the time, and primary form\nof entertainment, is scoring the days\ninto your bedpost. Either way, you will\ncount down to your eventual return to\ncivilisation and normalcy.\nMost days pass in a blur of confusion\nand fear. As you find your table in the\ndining hall, you wonder if that\u2019s an onion ring on your plate or maybe squid\n(or something with even more tenta-cles). And next to it, the mayonnaise \u2013 is\nthat genuine or have the guards \u2026 spat\nin your food?\nThe nights bring little relief. More often than not you are afflicted by cruel\nand unusual punishments. These can\nT\no those of you starting a\nnew chapter of your lives\nat Imperial this month,\nwelcome. This is the only\nparagraph you\u2019re getting\ndedicated to you for the rest of the year\nif I can help it. Breathe it in. I\u2019m here\nfor you. I care. Listen to these words of\nencouragement and sympathy. Your life\nis hard, but well done for making it this\nfar. All of those exams you had to do,\npoor little you. It must\u2019ve been really\nhard to coast on the back of natural abil-ity, copious amounts of privately funded\neducation, or an impeccable national\neducation system. Congratulations for\nbeing you. Pats on the back all round.\nRight, done. Normal service resuming - welcome back, shitsacks. Everyone happy to be back here, are we? I\ndo hope not. I hope it\u2019s sapping your\nvery will to live just dragging your\npathetic, decaying brains along Exhibition Road and up to the gates of\nthe college. Yeah, that\u2019s it. Cry a bit.\nWell up a little as you remember what\ncoursework submission smells like\non a Monday morning at 10am. Weep\ninto this jar here so I can massage it\ninto my gums later for sustenance. It\u2019s\nanother academic year, sweet cheeks.\nIt\u2019s a great time of year. A time of\nyear when my social media feeds fill\nup with messages from Imperial graduates \u2018jokingly\u2019 discussing how long it\nis until they can retire from the shitty,\nmoney-fuelled job they took as soon\nas they could leave Imperial with a\n2:1, whilst I can enjoy sitting in the\nJCR, slowly watching the day-by-day\ndecline in the parabola defining the\nsmiles on first year faces. The season\nof 9am lecture starts in the ball-aching\ncold. I chuckle not because I innately\nhate humankind, but because I\u2019m tired\nof having Imperial pander to its students so readily.\nThe way first-years are treated-defines Imperial\u2019s attitude towards its\nstudents. They\u2019re praised for having\ngotten so far, for gaining entry to one\nof the top universities in the world. It\u2019s\ntalked about as if most of the students\nactually worked for their qualifica-tions, as if the majority of Imperial\nundergraduates gave a shit about their\nsubject or their results. It\u2019s amusing,\nas well as being incredibly heartbreak-ing. As an institution, we couldn\u2019t give\na monkey\u2019s wankbucket whether or\nnot we create the scientific minds of\ntomorrow. We care about two things -getting the best students on day one,\nand pumping out the highest earners\non day three hundred and sixty-four.\nThe former ensures the latter, and so\nwe raise our standards of entry, sit\nback and relax. Who cares what happens in the intervening years? As long\nas the statistics come out right and the\nleague tables say what they should,\nthen we\u2019re golden.\nI\u2019m feeling generous this year so let\nme toss in a free extra paragraph for\nnew starters. Imperial contains some\nof the most amazing research, inspiring teachers and incredible resources\nyou will ever have access to. The path\nof least resistance will put you in contact with almost none of this. Cruise\nthrough, hit those pass requirements,\nand spend the rest of your days drinking yourself into oblivion, and you\nwill leave as an Imperial graduate to\napplause and deep, meaningless respect from everyone around you. Engage with your subject, talk to people\nthat interest you, and find out more\nabout why you came here in the first\nplace, and you\u2019ll leave in pretty much\nthe same circumstances. But you\u2019ll be\na different person. You\u2019re paying a lot\nfor the chance to spend four years at\nthis place.\nRecently, Silvio BerLADsconi\n(as no-one calls him) has been\non top form in terms of scandal.\nHe has had so many trials in\nhis time that it\u2019s actually hard\nto keep track. Currently, he is\ninvolved in four separate trials;\nthree for corruption and tax eva-sion, one involving being blackmailed by a pimp - in which he is\nnot the defendant (that\u2019s probably the most unsettling part).\nGianpaolo Tarantini is the\nman allegedly running a prostitution ring that Berlusconi regularly used to obtain girls. The\ntrial centres around recordings\nthat Tarantini secretly made of\nBerlusconi. There are too many\ngreat quotes to fit here, but as\nthe 80s song goes I\u2019ll hit you\nwith my best shot.\nBerlusconi called Angela\nMerkle an \u201cunfuckable lardarse\u201d. Good to know that those\nwords have a direct Italian-toEnglish translation.\nAfter insulting the Chancellor of the country that\u2019s about\nto bail out Italy, he decided to\ninsult Italy. He referred to it as\na \u201cshitty country\u201d saying he\nwants to leave. Then defended\nthis remark by saying it was\nthe sort of thing you say late at\nnight when you are relaxed. We\nall know how he gets that \u201crelaxed\u201d and if that\u2019s what he\u2019s\nlike when he\u2019s relaxed, what\nthe fuck is he like when he\u2019s\nagitated?\nHe also claimed he was the\nPM in his \u201cspare time\u201d. Contradicting the earlier claim that\nhe was the \u201cJesus Christ of\npolitics\u201d who \u201cjust kept giving\u201d.\nMaybe by giving he meant either\ngiving prostitutes semen onto\ntheir faces or a lot of money\nfor sex. He gives that a lot. Perhaps he\u2019s trying to kick-start the\neconomy by getting the prostitution profession back on its feet.\nHe bragged about his sexual\nexploits saying: \u201cLast night I\nhad a queue outside the door of\nthe bedroom \u2026 There were 11\n\u2026 I only did 8, because I could\nnot do it anymore.\u201d He is a man,\nso is prone to exaggeration. He\neven actively picked less rounded numbers.\nAt one point he turns to the\npimp and says: \u201cthe pussy\nneeds to go around\u201d. Now I\u2019m\nstarting to think that he was\nactually just writing rap lyrics at\nthe time that quote was taken.\nTim\u2019s PolitiLOLz of the week\nLove arguing? Yes. Good. Why don\u2019t you email us and join in a head-to-head. It\u2019s like fighting, but more passive aggressive.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nFELIX\n16\nTech news and reviews\nTechnology Editors: Feroz Salam\nChris Bowers\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 07 october 2011\nSteve Jobs passes away\nAn announcement made by Apple during the early\nhours of Thursday paid tribute to Steve Jobs, who\npassed away surrounded by his family at his home.\nApple\u2019s co-founder, chairman and former CEO was\na powerhouse whose drive pushed computers beyond the hands of researchers and hobbyists into\nthe home and our daily lives. His work at Pixar took\nhigh-quality animation into mainstream cinema,\ngiving us hits such as Toy Story, Wall-E and Finding\nNemo.\nIn recent years, his leadership at Apple has made\nthe world\u2019s most valuable brand, synonymous with\nhigh design principles and a focus on user experi-ence. Not content with the massive success of the\niPod, he led development of the touch-based iPhone\nand the iPad, which revolutionised their respective\nmarkets. Despite his passing, his influence on technology will be felt for decades to come.\nDaylight\u2019s Foldi LED Lamp is exactly what it says on\nthe tin. A desktop lamp featuring 30 LEDs to produce\nup to 1500 lux, the Foldi both dresses to impress\nand performs. Once you put in the batteries or plug\nit in using the supplied USB cable, you open up the\nFoldi and it immediately produces brilliantly bright\nlight. It has green credentials too, claiming it uses\n90% less energy than conventional bulbs. That\u2019s not\nall the Foldi has going for it though. Its name comes\nfrom the fact that it compacts itself when not in use.\nOpen it up to get the lights themselves in the top\npart, and a stand in the bottom. So it will stay upright\non a flat surface \u2013 perfect for desk use. So while the\nFoldi does perform well and is a quality product, it\u2019s\nnot quite perfect. It seems large for what it is, and is\npricey at \u00a369.99. And when it\u2019s tethered to your com-puter, I don\u2019t know what it will light that your monitor\nwon\u2019t. But if you\u2019re looking for a portable desk lamp,\nyou could do worse than the Foldi.\nBringing daylight to your desk\nCables, chargers everywhere. You\u2019ve got one\nfor your phone, another for your laptop, more\nfor those multiple alarm clocks that get you out\nof bed in the mornings\u2026 The list goes on. And\nwhile we can transfer so much wirelessly these\ndays \u2013 our keystrokes and mouse movements,\nour voices and even our internet \u2013 power is\nsomething still constrained to those same cables we seek to banish.\nWell, mostly - charging by induction has been\naround for some years now. This technology\n(based on electromagnetic induction \u2013 using an\nelectromagnetic field to produce a current in a\nnearby wire) is quite widespread, but also has a\nvery short range. It\u2019s been the preferred charging medium for electric toothbrushes for as long\nas I can remember, and more recently it can be\nfound on those \u201cwireless charging pads\u201d. But\nthe farthest you\u2019ll generally see it reaching is\nto activate RFID chips/NFC tags, and they only\nwork from 2 \u2013 3 centimetres away. Also, inductive chargers are usually slow and inefficient \u2013\nnot exactly desirable traits.\nSo for most applications, inductive power is\nnext to useless. You don\u2019t want to have to sit\nwith your laptop within 3 centimeters of your\nplug socket \u2013 it\u2019s just not practical. On top of\nthat, most inductive chargers are attached to\nthe power by a cable anyway, so you\u2019re really\nnot gaining much. Enter WiTricity. As you may\nhave guessed, the name derives from \u2018wireless\nelectricity\u2019 and that\u2019s exactly what it aims to\ndeliver.\nResearch into this technology started at MIT\nback in 2007, and was demonstrated two years\nlater. Since then, not much has happened, but\nToyota this year made an investment into the\nproject. So hopefully we should be seeing some\nadvances in it soon. In fact, in a statement made\nin the last couple of weeks, Toyota, Mitsubishi\nand the company behind WiTricity announced\nthat they will be looking to use the technology\nto charge electric cars wirelessly while parked.\nAlready it seems WiTricity is being applied to\nreal practical issues, which should really kickstart development.\nBut how does it work? Instead of induction,\nWiTricity uses electromagnetic resonance to\ntransfer power wirelessly. No actual electricity\nis sent through the air, instead you have a transmitter and a receiver set at identical frequen-cies, allowing the transmitter to use magnetic\nfields to transfer energy to the receiver. Parts of\nit do sound quite similar to inductive charging\ntechnology, but the variances do make all the\ndifference.\nIndeed, WiTricity basically makes up for the\nother technology\u2019s shortcomings. Where induction has a debilitating short range, WiTricity has\nbeen proven to work at distances of between 3\n\u2013 5 metres, and even when something is blocking direct line-of-sight between the transmitter\nand receiver. Additionally, a spokesman for the\ncompany has said that, while 90% efficiency\nhas been shown, they could limit transfer loss\nto a maximum of 3%. And with a quoted figure of 3.3 kilowatts of power being transferred\nusing the technology, albeit over a smaller dis-tance, it seems this technology has all its bases\ncovered.\nIt all sounds pretty good, but there must be\nsame drawbacks. Looking at those figures, it\nseems a careful balance between power and\nrange must be achieved, so as to still be useful.\nAnd as much as the company assures us that it\u2019s\nperfectly safe, and all electromagnetic radiation\nlevels fall safely under the FCC\u2019s limits, there\nwill always be those who distrust it. All in all\nthough, WiTricity looks like it could revolutio-nise the way we get power to our many devices.\nElectricity through the air\niPhone 4S debuts to mixed reactions\nTuesday evening brought us Tim Cook\u2019s first\nkeynote as Apple\u2019s outright CEO, but that\nwasn\u2019t the largest change as Apple turned\naway from its huge yearly update of the iPhone\nto instead offer punters an incrementally upgraded version, the iPhone 4S.\nKey features on the new phone include an upgrade to the A5 processor found on the iPad, an\nupgraded camera, faster data transfer rates, as\nwell as a new voice controlled \u2018assistant\u2019 Siri.\nWith the exception of the new display and Siri\nthe updates are all internal, providing snappier\nperformance without much of an UI revamp.\nSiri, however, proved to be the star of the\nshow. The assistant, originally created by a\ncompany for the earlier iPhones (now purchased\nby Apple), attempts to intelligently guess your\nvoice requests and answer your questions. Ask\nit \u2018what\u2019s the weather like where I am now?\u2019, for\nexample, and it should pull your location from\nthe GPS, look up the weather for it and push out\na weather forecast for you in a few seconds. It\u2019s\nan exciting feature, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine\nthe ridicule that would be heaped on anyone\nponcing around London streets conversing with\ntheir phone.\nOtherwise, reactions to the new iDevice were\nmixed. While Apple has managed to raise the\nbar in some way at every iteration of the iPhone,\nthis update put it squarely where other competing Android devices have been for the last few\nmonths.\nThe fact is that after the minor price cut,\nApple is competing directly with Samsung and\nMotorola on price, a position it isn\u2019t holding in\nany other markets. This is probably indicative of\nhow importantApple finds it to get these devices\ninto people\u2019s hands - withAndroid phones quantitatively outstripping iOS devices by a large\nmargin, Apple will not want to lose out on the\nsteady revenue stream of a strong app market.\nAlso worth a mention is Apple\u2019s refresh of the\niPod lineup, which sees the Nano now available\nas a watch and the Touch available in both black\nand white with a storage upgrade to 64GB.\nGiven Apple\u2019s strong fanbase it would be\nfoolish not to expect the regular queues for the\n4S in a week\u2019s time, but whether you buy one of\nthe new 4Ss or not will likely depend on where\nyou lean on the Android/Apple debate. In case\nyou\u2019re an Apple fan, this is probably a good\nchance to refurbish your phone to give it some\ntop-notch speed and graphical goodness; in case\nyou\u2019re not, look up the Samsung Galaxy S II\nfor a similar specification at a similar price, or\nwait for Samsung\u2019s \u2018Something BIG\u2019event next\nweek, which will probably reveal the Nexus\nPrime in all it\u2019s cutting edge glory.\nFeroz Salam\nChris Bowers\nYou could win a Foldi!

Alice Yang gives you this season\u2019s best, and remember \u2013 detail is everything\nHats\nEyes were drawn up and beyond the faces of\nthis season\u2019s models to the hats that flew\nacross the catwalk for AW11/12. Marc Jacobs presented fun plastic berets with a hint\nof fetish, whilst Dolce and Gabbana strutted\nsharp androgynous trilbies, adding an edge to\ntheir fun and glittery show. Wide brims offset\ndecorative collars at Nina Ricci and Lanvin,\ncreating a sense of mystery and glamour. On\na warmer note, Christopher Bailey perched\nsimple furry caps above a sea of multicolored\ncoats at Burberry Prorsum, as Missoni opted\nfor sugar sweet beanies giving the upcoming\nwinter a sprinkle of fairy dust.\nBe daring, pick out your look and wear with\na generous dose of attitude.\nTHE PICK:\nThe deep autumnal shades seen in Gucci\u2019s\nwide brimmed trilbies with traditional orange\nfeathers nail subtle sophistication to perfec-tion. For a smaller feather to suit smaller wal-lets, try H&M\u2019s version in deep plum. Pair with\na jewel coloured faux fur coat and dark scarlet\nlips for a nod towards the seventies, or perch\nabove a simple cut dress and boots for an\neffortless city vibe that will take you from day\nto night.\nShoulder Skimming\nEarrings\nA good outfit is never complete without the\nright jewellery, and this season designers\nheaded for statement earrings.\nThe models at Oscar de la Renta hung\nstrings of irregularly shaped gems from their\nears skimming the shoulders of beautifully lavish dresses, whilst Marni took a trip back to\nkinder garden with large coloured disks and\nhoops contrasting strict, elongated hemlines.\nRalph Lauren embraced the east, matching\nhis enchanting rich flowing silk gowns with\noriental lucky charms in traditional colours of\njade and red. Back in Paris, maturity and simplicity emulated at Sonia Rykiel\u2019s seventies\ninspired catwalk as classical metallic baubles\nhung from delicate long chains creating a real\nsense of Parisian elegance.\nAdd a hint of red carpet to your look this sea-son, be bold and let your ears take the weight.\nTHE PICK:\nDolce and Gabbana take home the golden star\nfor their playful crystal encrusted series, an\ninstant buy for any glamorous, fun loving fash-ionista. Not quite so precious, but still very\nshiny, Topshop do a brilliant imitation. Throw\non your favourite LBD and let these sparkly\nstars hang above your shoulders, drawing attention to your neck, which is best left clear.\nBoots As always, when the cold settles in, the boots\ncome out. This season is no different. Deeply\nluxurious and embellished in jewel coloured\nvelvet, Alberta Ferretti went thigh high with a\nrich retro feel. Going back to the sixties, Prada incorporated snakeskin and Mary Janes\ninto pair after pair of knee boots as Valentino managed to keep things pretty, matching\ndelicately sheer dresses with beautiful lace\ncovered boots. Isabel Marant preferred the\nwilder side, and made hers heavily fringed for\ncool cowboy chic.\nWhat ever your style, make sure you invest\nin some good boots. They\u2019re a staple this season and will keep your feet toasty for months\nto come.\nTHE PICK:\nTextured, tough and with a hint of grunge, Chanel\u2019s boots are perfect for stomping through\npiles of crunchy leaves. A slight heel adds\nfemininity (not to mention height), yet is still\nwearable on the slipperiest of frozen days.\nMore affordable variations can be found all\nover the high street from Zara to H&M. Wear\nwith skinny jeans and a leather coat for the\nrough and ready biker look, or do like Alexa\nChung and team with a cute dress.\nDazzling Feet Longer hours thrown in the dark may be a\ncause for concern for some, but not on this\nseasons catwalks. Jean Paul Gautlier\u2019s metallic kitty heels matched the chignon hair of his\nmodels, as they marched down in his colour-fully patterned play on smart wear. Prada too\ndisplayed elegance in glittering courts, a welcome sight after seasons of feet clad in black,\ngrey and nude. Alexander Wang\u2019s tough cool\ngirls also embraced the shine, parading silver\ncaped stilettos to match their heavy billowing\ncoats. Of course, not to be out-shone, Vivienne Westwood joined the fun as heavily sequined feet strutted down a similarly stunning\ngold-covered catwalk, light bouncing of every\nsurface creating a scene of brilliant luxury and\nrichness.\nWhether it reminds you of the glamorous\nseventies or your dream wedding, live like a\nfairy tale and let your feet shine.\nTHE PICK:\nMiu Miu dazzled this season, teaming long\nsophisticated lengths and sharp collars with\ndisco shoes. Kurt Geiger\u2019s platforms are similarly bright and can dress up the simplest of\noutfits. Wear with a tailored suit for a stunningly powerful take on this season\u2019s androgynous look.\nTopshop\n\u00a312.50\nKurt\nGeiger\n\u00a3120\nGucci\n\u00a3305\nH&M\n\u00a312.99\nMiu Miu\n\u00a3370\nTopshop\n\u00a370.00\nChanel\n~\u00a3800\nFELIX Friday 07 october 2011 21\nFashion Editors: Saskia Verhagen\nAlice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDolce and\nGabbana\n\u00a3245\n\n"

Whilst\nthis describes the tour to leave it at\nthat would not do it justice. C&G RFC\ncelebrated the end of the season with\na 4-day tour to Berlin where they participated in the 2nd International Rugby\nUnion Sevens.\nSevens captain Niall Watson did everything in his power to get his team\nto the airport on time \u2013 driving a minibus through midnight London, picking\nup stragglers at the Union, Belushi\u2019s\nHammersmith and Belushi\u2019s Fulham.\nThanks to his dedication, the team\ncaught their flight on time and enjoyed\na little power nap before getting woken\nup gently by the pilot when he crashed\ndown on Berlin Schonefeld airport. Tour\ntranslator Max Joachim awaited the\ntour party which quickly made its way\nthrough Berlin to their accommodation\nin Hohen Neuendorf, a little town just\nnorth of Berlin. The local rugby club\nRugby Union Hohen Neuendorf had\norganized the 2nd international Rugby\nUnion Sevens and did everything they\ncould to make us feel at home \u2013 they\neven brought in some proper English\nweather \u2013 but let\u2019s not get ahead of\nourselves. After a quick lunch, we took\npublic transport again to meet our guide\nfor a bicycle sightseeing tour through\nBerlin.\nThe weather was fantastic and the\nguide made sure that there were plenty\nof breaks on the way so that we didn\u2019t\nexhaust ourselves before the Sevens\nthe next day.

Introducing himself and the rest of the Sport\nImperial team to the hundred or so\nteam captains and sports club committee members, he was full of praise for\nthe achievements of IC sports clubs\nlast season. \u201cFive years ago, our objective was to get into the BUCS (Brit-ish Universities and Colleges Sport)\nleague table top twenty. I\u2019m delighted\nto say we did it.\u201d\nImperial has indeed seen an exceptional rise in the BUCS rankings,\nclimbing from 39th at the end of the\n2006 season to 17th at the close of last\nseason. Impressive wins for the fencers and a haul of points from the Imperial Boat Club are among the main\nsuccesses of last year, but points have\ncome from an extremely wide range of\nsports in an excellent sporting year (as\nreported by your favourite newspa-per). Mosley has ambitious plans for\nthe future, with a very concrete short-term goal: \u201cWe finished just behind\nLeeds University last year, who have\nmore than thirty thousand students.\nThe gap was only ten points \u2013 that\u2019s\nnothing, it\u2019s a podium finish at BUCS.\nWe\u2019re aiming to beat Leeds this year.\u201d\nMoving past a university with almost three times the amount of students we have is no mean feat \u2013 but\napparently Sport Imperial has loftier\ngoals: \u201cUltimately, in the next few\nyears, the objective is to finish higher\nthan Cambridge, who are in 14th place\nat the moment. There\u2019s already an academic rivalry with them, and getting\npast them in the league tables would\nmean a lot to many people at Imperial.\u201d However, unlike Cambridge\nor Oxford (10th), Mosley says there\nwon\u2019t be a concerted effort to attract\nelite-level sportspeople \u2013 we won\u2019t\nbe having ex-All Blacks on our rugby\nteam any time soon.\nNevertheless, such ambition does\ncost money, and Sport Imperial have\nbeen establishing commercial partner-...Continued on Page 34\n\u2018Snowoperative\u2019\npromising pistes for\nless\nIC snowsports teams up with other\nunis to offer reduced price trips as\nwell as joint socials Page 35\n\n"

Olja is the\nCroatian Simon Cowell \u2013 judge and\nvocal mentor on the Croatian X Factor and prolific composer and arranger\nfor TV and radio (OK, quite a lot more\ntalented than Cowell\u2026 and nicer). IC\nChamber Choir were invited to open\nthe festival but could not enter the con-test, due to the size of the group.\nWe began by visiting the beautiful island of Krk, the largest in the Adriatic\nand a popular holiday destination since\nRoman times. We arrived in Krk city to\ndiscover a beautiful coastal old town\ncomplete with narrow pedestrian stone\npaths and stunning views of the Adriatic. The city was awash with tourists\n\u2013 none of the English stag-do types;\nthis was a city with a thriving tourist industry attracting happy-camping\nGermans, Italians, Slovenians and\nother continental Europeans for several months each summer. Undaunted\nby the lack of English speakers, we\nchecked in to our hostel, which was a\nshoddier version of the hotel featured\nin this summer\u2019s blockbuster The Inbetweeners Movie. Seriously. Police\ntape covered room doors not occupied\nby us, unisex bathrooms had no washbasins and the staff had a combined\nEnglish vocabulary of about 50 words.\nStill, in true Inbetweeners form we\nmanaged to enjoy our time there, give\nor take the broken bunk bed, the TC in\nthe shower and the hostel owner who\nthreatened to visit London and take our\nTV because we used his cutlery!\nOn the music front, IC Chamber\nChoir and Techtonics each performed\none evening concert in the main square\nof the city of Krk, to appreciative and\nenthusiastic crowds. Several members of the Techtonics were surprised\nto discover they\u2019d attracted a teenage\nGerman fanclub \u2013 we\u2019re still hoping\nthese girls won\u2019t find us on Facebook!\nBonus of the tour was free shots at\nmultiple watering holes for singing\nour songs after a few drinks\u2026 the\nlocals couldn\u2019t get enough of us! We\nalso managed to visit the nearby port\ntown of Punat, where the groups performed a joint concert on the terrace\nbar of the swanky Park Punat Hotel\non the promenade. Passers-by stopped\nto listen, hotel patrons swooned, and\nwe received a generous round of figs\nand brandy from the manager! That\nevening was definitely one of the highlights of the tour.\nKrk island also featured great ex-cursions. Many of the group hired bicycles and visited, amongst others, a\nnudist beach, where our pasty skins,\nbrash English accents and faff about\nundressing attracted more than a few\nonlookers! We salute the brave few\n(many!!) who did the Full Monty. It\u2019s\nnot everyday you can say \u2018When in\nCroatia\u2026 get naked\u2019.\nOn to the business end of tour,\nupon arrival in Rijeka we travelled to\nTrsat Castle, a 13th century fortress\nat the top of a steep hill, overlooking the Adriatic. On the castle terrace\nthat evening, IC Chamber Choir kick\nstarted the Vocal Marathon, performing jointly with award-winning youth\nchoir \u2018Josip Kaplan\u2019 to a full house\naudience and several TV cameras. IC\nflickr/publicenergy\nEugene Chang\nChamber Choir director Jess Gillingwater conducted both groups as they\nperformed several folk songs together,\nand the concert rousingly finished with\nICCC singing \u2018Over the Rainbow\u2019.\nThe next day featured vocal masterclasses with Tomaz Kozlevcar, Slovenian composer/arranger known for his\narrangement of Toto\u2019s Africa, which\nhas gained 11 million YouTube hits.\nWe worked on group exercises, and\nsplit up to learn and perform several\nvocal arrangements. Next up that evening was the main event of the festival\n\u2013 the Vocal Marathon, a 4 hour concert\nfeaturing 25 minute sets from various a\ncappella groups including the Techtonics. With vociferous support from IC\nChamber Choir, the Techtonics sang\ntheir hearts out on top of the range\nsound equipment and microphones.\nWe performed our own arrangements\nof This Love (Maroon 5), Dreadlock\nHoliday (10cc), House of the Rising\nSun (The Animals), Dock of the Bay\n(Otis Redding) and a Go Your Own\nWay mashup (Fleetwood Mac). We\nlike to think we brought the house\ndown; many of the other groups came\nto tell us how much they enjoyed our\nset. We finished the evening on our\ncharter coach full of singers from all\ngroups, singing girl band tunes, The\nLion Sleeps Tonight and a host of vocal favourites. Probably the most harmonious vocal coach journey ever!\nTHE highlight of the contest was\nthe performance of Austrian solo loop\nbeatboxer \u2018fii\u2019 who blew the entire tour\ngroup away with his range, personality and ability \u2013 his hit \u2018Power To The\nPeople\u2019 got us all dancing, and did\nthe same to TV judges on German X\nFactor 3 weeks ago! Definitely worth\nchecking out on YouTube!\nThe final awards show of the competition featured each group performing\na song for TV recording, to be broadcast later in September \u2013 Techtonics\nreprised Dreadlock Holiday. In the\nend, competition results did not go our\nway, but we were up against several\nprofessional and semi-professional\ngroups with years more experience,\nand we were grateful for the experience and opportunity to perform and\ninteract with such fantastic vocal\ngroups such as Cappella\u2019A, the Slash,\nOctachord, and Akvarel \u2013 we have\nbeen invited back next year and who\nknows how much our game will have\nrisen by then!\nThere was time for one final night\nof partying with other groups on a\nfloating nightclub along the seafront,\nbefore our weary trip back to London.\nTo find out more about each group\nor to audition, email Donal Connolly\nd.connolly09@imperial.ac.uk for\nICCC, or Ben Chadwick at techton-ics@imperial.ac.uk for TTs.\nTwo vocal ensembles take on Rijeka and contend with (Croatian) X Factor judges\nMan strives to achieve elusive falsetto as A Cappella group pose in the Croatian sunset\n\u201cIt\u2019s not every day\nyou can say \u2018When in\nCroatia... get naked\u2019\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 07 OCTOBER 2011 25\nTRAVEL\nAcclimatising to incredible India\nWhen I first touched down in New Delhi\nI have to say I was a tad deceived. Having skimmed my trusty Lonely Planet, I\nwas expecting the Paharganj area to be\na bustling Th Khao San \u00e0 la Bangkok,\nbut was greeted with something else\nentirely. I suppose I have my own ignorance to thank; I\u2019d been told about what\nto expect, but brushed it off under the\npretence that I am some sort of travel\nwizard.\nDay one was largely about acclima-the tower for spectacular views of the\ncity: the contrast of Old to New Delhi\nis quite a sight.\nAt this point in the day the torrential\ndownpour began: a Hindu festival was\nunderway, so rather than cowering forever we waded through flooded streets,\nup to our knees in the water. Sounds\nlike fun, right? It would be so were it\nnot for the unidentified floating objects\nswishing by our ankles. Cars chugged\nby, barely missing our feet, and the\nstreet was lit up and excitable. We finally escaped the madness and decided\nto kick back with a thali.\nBut enough about ambling through\nOld Delhi: having been confined to\nthat small hub we eventually ventured\ninto sprawling New Delhi to see what\nwas on offer. New Delhi and Old Delhi are worlds apart, but each has their\ncharm according to your needs. New\nDelhi makes for fantastic shopping,\nboth the franchise and market variet-ies, in and around the Connaught Place\narea. One place I highly recommend is\nPalika Bazaar, a conveniently air-con-ditioned market selling endless Indian\ngarments, where it\u2019s easy to push for a\ngood bargain.\nI could ramble endlessly about the\ntemples on offer, but every guidebook\nwill already give you the low down.\nAll I\u2019ll say is be sure to check out at\nleast a few before you get \u2018all templed\nout\u2019 \u2013 the Lotus Temple, Humayun\u2019s\nTomb and Akshardham just out of\ntown were all personal favourites and\nshouldn\u2019t be missed. And after temple\napathy takes its toll, a peaceful stroll\nthrough Lodi Gardens will refresh the\nbody and soul. And no trip would be\ncomplete without a visit to the Gandhi\nSmriti: Gandhi is still an invaluable\ninspiration to modern Indian activists\nsuch as Anna Hazare, and this interactive remembrance centre does his ideologies great justice.\nDelhi is a metaphor for all of India,\nreally: initially the madness is fright-ening, but let the initial uncertainties\nand doubts subside and you\u2019ll soon\nfind that you\u2019re in the middle of one of\nthe most interesting and diverse countries on the planet. Expect a culture\nshock, but don\u2019t let it get the better of\nyou. Because the food is fantastic, the\npeople are perfect, and the sights are\nsimply spectacular \u2013 I don\u2019t need to\nsell it any more than that.\nFollow the adventures of a backpacker across the mighty subcontinent, beginning\nwith some sightseeing in the country\u2019s brilliant capital city\nChris Richardson\ntisation; opting for Old Delhi as our\nquarters we headed out to live and\nbreathe the fresh stenches of cow pat\nand spices. Now don\u2019t get me wrong,\nOld Delhi is fantastic, if a little daunting for your first India destination. It\u2019s\ngot some fantastic eateries serving\nvast amounts of sweet and savoury\nfare, and is the cheapest option when it\ncomes to racking up gifts. As always,\njust beware the commission touts!\nWhile still getting used to malaria\npills and the thick monsoon air we\nheaded for Old Delhi\u2019s Red Fort area,\nto get our first taste of incredible India.\nThis was the first of many forts we\u2019d\nencounter on our adventure: they make\ngreat landmarks for tuk-tuk drivers\nand offer a glimpse into the shimmering past with their dusty construction\nand plethora of artefacts. We ticked\noff the Old Delhi to-do list, rounding off in Jama Masjid, India\u2019s largest\nmosque. If you visit, be sure to climb\n\u201cthe food is fantastic\nand the sights are\nsimply spectacular\u201d\nThe LaLiT New Delhi: Luxurious stay in the heart of the city\nPlanning a trip to Delhi? The LaLiT New Delhi is a perfect \u201ccity stay\u201d option \u2013 nestled snugly in the Connaught\nPlace area, this luxury hotel offers immaculate rooms with bedroom views over Delhi to rival the towers of Jama\nMasjid. With largest inventory and room space in the hub of New Delhi, this hotel takes away the location ad-vantage.\nAfter touring the smoggy city, Rejuve - The Spa is the most apt place to unwind, or if you\u2019re still feeling the\nheat then kicking back in a comfy lounger by the pool might be more fitting. Rejuve \u2013 The Spa, The Lalit\u2019s signature award winning spa is known for its therapies and treatments. To satiate one\u2019s appetite, this hotel has\ncuisine variety for individual taste, buffet of more than 67 dishes, one of its kinds -Indian Bread Bar, Specialty\nrestaurants, 24 hours food service and a lot more. The new and swanky night club - Kitty Su is anyway under the\nspot light for being the most happening party place in town. Perfect place to dance the night away with friends!\nThe LaLiT Hotels is the flagship brand of Bharat Hotels Limited Enterprise, a part of The LaLiT Suri Hospitality Group.

I interview Dr Martin DareEdwards; the company\u2019s UK Country\nManager with nearly 30 years experience in the industry after graduating\nand completing a PhD in Chemistry at\nOxford University.\nTucked into the green suburbs of\nOxfordshire lies a small cluster of\nbuildings, home to one of the most\nsuccessful petroleum additives companies across the globe. Dr Martin\nDare-Edwards himself greets me apol-ogising for the modesty of the site explaining that at Infineum \u2018we prefer to\nimpress with our technology, not our\nbuildings\u2019.\nelectric vehicles and fuel cells to finally kick in.\nWhat we sell to our customers, the\noil companies, is an additive package\ncontaining up to 50 different chemical components in a concentrated form\nwhich when you take the package and\npour some into oil, it makes a lubricant.\u2019\nHe translates this for me, since my\nbrain has long forgotten all its chem-istry, by comparing the process to the\nmaking of tropical fruit juice cordial.\n\u2018Imagine for a moment if you buy it\nfrom Tesco, you pour water in and you\nhave something drinkable. We make\nthe cordial, but the cordial itself is\nmade up of a number of different com-ponents; mango, pineapple\u2026.\u2019\nAs I finally begin to nod in compre-hension, he explains the process in\nmore detail. \u2018What these laboratories\nare developing is the individual tropical fruit juice types in a concentrated\nform. They are detergents, to keep\nthe engine clean; dispersants, because\nthere are particles that are created during the operation of an engine, including soot, and anti-oxidants to try and\navoid the degradation of the oil and\nanti-wear additives which go onto\nthe surface of the metal, so when the\npieces of metal come into contact it reduces the tendency of the metals that\nadhere to each other.\u2019\nRealising that chemistry is not strong\nsubject for me, Dr Dare-Edwards suggests we move away from the labs and\ninto a meeting room as I inquire into\nhis day-to-day activities.\n\u2018I maintain the integrity of all of the\noperations on this site. All of the contracts for running the site are under my\nresponsibility. At any point in time, if\nany of these facilities are not available,\nthen the whole operation grinds to a\nhalt very quickly and on the research\nend of the business, some of the time\nscales we work on are very tight.\nI happen also to be a member of\nthe technology leadership team, also\nknown as the Global R+D leadership\nteam, which is important in ensuring\nthe way the projects are selected, pri-oritised, and that the way they are conducted is as effective as possible.\u2019\nHaving graduated with a First Class\nHonours in Chemistry from the University of Oxford, yet now being in\nsuch a managerial role, I wonder if\nhe ever misses the safety glasses and\nwhite coats. \u2018I did miss it to start with.\nOne of the main reasons why I took\nup to do a scientific degree in the first\nplace is that I am a curious person, I\nwant to understand why and beyond\nthat, I wonder if it can be made better than it is currently. If I worked in\na finance house, just managing money,\nI wouldn\u2019t gain the same pleasure as\nI do now. However I\u2019ve been very\nfortunate to still gain some of the excitement from discovering things, but\nI don\u2019t actually have to get my hands\ndirty so to say. The closest thing I do\nto practical chemistry is cooking at\nhome.\u2019\nIn the academic world, the chicken has\ngot to come before the egg.\u2019\nShell gambled on him to the tune of\n\u00a3110,000 to study the behaviour of lubricants in a working lubricated con-tact, the resulting research earning him\na prestigious academic award.\n\u2018If you want to have a varied career,\ngo into industry,\u2019 he advises as I wonder how it is he gained the large variety\nof business management skills he has\nharnessed. \u2018Shell had a management in\nresearch course to help you understand\npeople management. It taught me what\nwas necessary to motivate people and\nmanage their performance. This provided a good foundation.\u2019\nBeyond the Infineum campus, Dr\nDare-Edwards is also Chairman of the\nOxfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership (Oxon-LEP) and the Oxfordshire Innovation and Growth Team\n(OxIGT), both of which give advice\nand support to local businesses, helping them to develop.\nI question whether or not the government cuts have then in fact hit Oxfordshire and its local support projects.\n\u2018Government cuts are a big issue in\nvarious regards; infrastructure, even\nthe provision of skills, apprentice\nplaces and so on are all affected by\ngovernment cuts. So at the same time\nthe government wants the economy to\ngrow, a number of the features that it\nhopes to grow have been taken away.\u2019\nAfter such a successful career, and\nnow in a demanding role he obviously enjoys, I ask Dr Dare-Edwards\nwhat advice he\u2019d give to our readers.\n\u2018In terms of what you can control, undergraduates should find opportunities\nto visit industrial research activities in\nthe UK and see what it\u2019s about.\nAlso, it would be useful for people to\nrecognise what business management\nis actually about. It\u2019s not all about just\nmanaging financial affairs; there are\npeople in there and new ideas to be\nfostered. The sourcing of money and\nhow to turn those ideas into something practical is itself very interesting and will intrinsically benefit from\nsomebody who\u2019s had a scientific background.\u2019\nBefore ending the interview I ask\nDr Dare-Edwards what lessons he has\nlearnt from his experiences and what\nhe looks for when employing people.\nAfter a deep thoughtful silence he re-plies, \u2018I like people to be curious, state\nthe obvious and question the given\ntruth because what you\u2019ve always told\nto be true might not be.\nThe interview is conducted in the\nJames Watt Building, which Dr DareEdwards refers to as his own, having led its construction of \u00a320m. The\nbuilding is split into mirroring quar-ters. \u2018It\u2019s open plan and also egali-tarian, which means that everyone is\nequal, except for this glass front\u2019 signalling to the glass planes separating\n(yet giving a full view into) the connecting laboratories.\n\u2018At Infineum, what we\u2019re doing is to\ntry and reduce the environmental effect of transportation now with the internal combustion engine, rather than\nwaiting 30 years for the technology of\n\u201cIf you want to have\na varied career, go\ninto industry\u201d\n\u201cState the obvious\nand question the\ngiven truth\u201d\nUpon the subject of his PhD, which\nhe also took at Oxford, I ask why it\nwas he chose to do one as opposed to\nentering the industry directly. \u2018I didn\u2019t\nknow what industrial research was\nlike; I was never introduced to it at\nuniversity. I think the largest problem\nis people just don\u2019t know what\u2019s out\nthere. I went to do a PhD because at\nthat particular time I might have imagined I wanted to become a university\nprofessor.\u2019\nOn applying for fellowships, Dr\nDare-Edwards came across Shell and\ndescribes to me how this proved to be\nlife changing. \u2018If you stay in academic\nresearch you typically have to stick\nwith the subject you already started\nworking on whether you like it or not,\nor else you can\u2019t get funding. In the in-dustrial, world people will harness you\non the basis that you have a track record of being able to learn something\nquickly, get it right, do some research\nand get an outcome. They tend to take\na calculated gamble in putting someone in a role they can\u2019t do yet. The\nacademic world would never do that.\nDr Martin Dare-Edwards\nInfineum campus, Oxfordshire\nInfineum\nAlice Yang\n\n"
