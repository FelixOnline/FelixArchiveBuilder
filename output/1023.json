    "content": "IC Radio\nELECTION INTERVIEWS A summary of interviews conducted by IC Radio last Tuesday...\nPresident\nInterviewer: Paul Dias (Ex IC\nRadio News Editor)\nMiles Ambler\nMiles was first questioned about his proposed\ncommunications meetings. Reminded of\nprevious failures to implement such a strategy\nand the disinterest that led to the end of\nUGMs, he retorted that was \"down to the fact\nthat people didn't know about the issues\". He\nclaimed use of the college media would\nalleviate this. He later said that if elected, he\nintended to write weekly columns in FELIX to keep students informed.\nM rAmbler asked about his stated\nintention to visit all first year lectures in the\nfirst weeks of term. It was pointed out that the\ncurrent president had said a similar thing but\nfound her first week was over '100 hours' and\ntherefore she abandoned the plan. Miles\nreiterated his commitment, saying that he\nwould be prepared to work on Saturdays if\nnecessary and that he didn't consider ten\nminutes per lecture an impossible task.\nHe stated his intention to set up a network of departmental Ents reps to help\nimprove the entertainments provided by the\nUnion and his commitment to the CCUs. The\ninterview finished with Miles saying that as\nPresident it would be \"the student's views that\nhe would be listening to\".\nKevin Ward\nMr Ward was first questioned about the\nweekly meetings which he had promised to\nhold. He responded with a reiteration - that\nhe, or a representative, would be present at the\nappointed time to hear students views, or else\nhe would tender his resignation. It was\nsuggested that if no-one turned up, Kevin\nwould be sitting around doing nothing. Ward\ncombated this by saying that two hours spent\nalone in the bar could still be used\nconstructively, possibly \" thinking about\nfurther meetings\"to be held later in the week.\nHis promise to improve Da Vinci's was\ndiscussed, with Mr Ward suggesting that an\nimproved Union catering service would force\ncollege catering to improve (although he\naccepted that Da Vinci's was not capable of\nserving 7000 people). He said in his first year,\nMM FELIX03 mf lR95 food in Da Vinci's was \"substantially better\"\nand seemed better value for money too.\nHe claimed that he was an 'informed'\noutsider to the Union, and that he would\ntherefore not bring preconceived ideas to the\njob. This, he said, would help him make the\nUnion more accountable to the students. He\nwas heavily questioned about his intention to\nimprove security at Union events. When asked if the problem was really so serious, Mr Ward said that he wanted to \"nip it in the\nbud\" and that any violence was too much. It\nwas put to him that it might cost in the region\nof \u00a330,000 to implement his plan to replace\nstewards with professional staff, which Mr Ward admitted would be too much to pay, but\nhe disputed this was the real cost.\nMr Ward ended up by saying he was the\nbest candidate because he had: \"a wide\nranging point of view, with varied experience\nboth in and out of college\".\nSarah White\nIt was first put to Miss White that she had\nshied away from mentioning many issues in\nher manifesto. She responded by pointing out\nthat \"the issues will be the same for all of us,\nit's how we deal with them that's important.\"\nOn the popular subject of regular open\nforums, she said she 'couldn't really ask the\nUnion to pay for her to spend an hour sitting\nin the bar' but that she would have a set hour\nin the week where she would be guaranteed to\nbe available in her office. She said that she\nherself had had no problems accessing the\nUnion representatives.\nCommunication would be best\nimproved by using existing structures more\nfully, she said, citing in particular the\nDepartmental Reps as an important link. The\nUnion as a whole was not \"quick and\nefficient\" at communicating. She said that the\nPresident could try to do this in his/her\nposition as a leader - \"to draw everyone\ntogether\".\nShe said that the President should be\nable to communicate also with staff, as well as\nstudents. Sarah said that the two audiences\nwere different: \"a lot of the time they [staff]\ndon't accept that there is a problem\". She\ncited her experience as a Geology Rep as\nimportant in giving her those skills. When\nasked if there was anything in particular that\nvoters should bear in mind, she said that she\nintended to \"talk to college hierarchy about\nparticular Welfare issues, such as student\nhardship and accommodation issues ... which\naffect us every day of every year\".\nDeputy President\n(Finance and\nServices)\nInterviewer: Andrew Tseng\n( FELIX News Editor)\nMatt Crompton\nMatt was first asked whether his lack of\nexperience in Union affairs was an issue. He\nresponded by saying that for this post a great\ndeal of experience in Union business was not\nimportant, although he added that he does\nhave experience in business matters. He was\nthen asked if his experience of running a shop\nwas really equivalent to that required to\nmanage the far larger interests of the Union.\nHe said that it was relevant as the Union post\nalso involved handling of money and solving\nday-to-day problems and queried whether any\nstudent would have experience of running a \"\u00a32M turnover institution\".\nAsked to clarify his opposition to the\nUnion move to Sherfield, he said that it was\nthe current plans he opposed - he'd back the\nmove if the new facilities were good enough.\nHe said he opposed losing tradition for a \"faceless modern building like the Sherfield\".\nHe was asked about his commitment to\nthe CC Us and said that their role was\nprimarily to \"provide the first step in communications between most of the students\nand the Union [and to] provide some extra\nhistory as well\". Asked if they should be\nabolished, Mr Crompton said that he believed\nthey shouldn't, citing inter C CU sports\nmatches as an example of a beneficial\nincreased rivalry. He said as D P(F&S) he\nwould look at their money needs and make\nsure they are spending money properly.\nAsked what he offered above other\ncandidates, Mr Crompton said that he could\noffer: \"efficiency and dedication ... experience\nin money and communication as well.\"\nAnnie Mathewman\nDid not attend the interview programme.\n\n"

    "content": "News\nIC Funding Falls\nBY ANDREW DORMANT his year's increase of 0.7%\n(before inflation) in Imperial\nCollege's government research\nfunding is only one third the\nnational average. The allocation,\nwhich will mean a drop in real\nterms, has been blamed on\nchanges in the complicated\ndistribution system used by the\nfunding council.\nDr Rodney Eastwood,\nDeputy Managing Director, speaking to FELIX attempted to\nallay fears that this decrease\nwould affect the research\nactivities of the college. Dr Eastwood said that Imperial\nwould \"find ways to make up the\ndifference\", but as the funding\nfigures had only been announced\nthe day before, he declined to say\nhow this would be achieved.\nDr Eastwood explained that\nthe pool of funds had been\n\"adjusted between research\nareas\", and that in this instance\n\"it had worked to our\ndisadvantage\", but that generally\n\"we do share common interests\".\nThe Deputy Managing Director stressed though that the\nimpending HE FCE grading\nexercise was much more\nimportant for the future of the\ncollege's research funding. The\nprocess which will rate all\ndepartments on a seven point\nscale has been described as\n'fundamental', as this will decide\neach area's future funding.\nWith HE FCE quoting a40% increase before inflation over the\nlast four years in IC's research\nfunding, this drop still leaves the\ncollege with one of the highest\namounts of money in the\ncountry. Dr Eastwood assured\nstudents not to get too worried,\nsaying that the college's mission\nis not going to change. \"We're\nnot going to become a polytechnic,\" he insisted, later\nadding \"and we're not going to\ngo broke or anything\".\nGuilds Decline\nBY ANDREW TSENG South Kensington Constituent\nCollege Unions (CCU) appear to\nbe in decline following the\nannouncement of City & Guilds\nCollege Union (C& GCU) election\nresults. Students in the engineering and management departments voted for next years\nelective committee last Monday\nand Tuesday.\nBar new election, all posts\nhad only one candidate standing\nand in a marked decline from last\nyear, figures were back to '93\nlevels. 190 votes in all were cast,\ncompared to 424 last year, from a membership of over 3000.\nWhen asked give reasons for\nthe low turnout, Tammy Atkins,\nC&GC U Honorary Secretary\ncited the lack of contested posts\nalong with \"less and late\npublicity\". She added that there\nhad also been less interest this\nyear in CCUs in general.\nSome controversy surrounds\nthe election of Sarah Thomas, for\nthe post of President and this\nyears publicity officer. Ms Thomas is also standing\nunopposed for the Captaincy of\nthe Hockey club and some Guilds\ninsiders are concerned at the\nworkload two jobs would entail.\nThis has been highlighted by\nconflicts within the current\nGuild's executive, which have\nbeen compounded by both VicePresident, Richard Oussedik and\nHonorary Junior Treasurer,\nGareth Parry, resigning over\nworkload problems.\nThose elected were: (for\nPresident) Sarah Thomas, (for\nVice-President) Duncan Tindall,\n(for Honorary Secretary) New\nElection, (for Honorary Junior\nTreasurer) Simon Cope, (for City\n& Guilds College Association\nRepresentative) Steve Starkey\nand (for Guildsheet Editor) Jon\nJansen.\nFollowing the failure of\nJames Tuff to be elected\nHonorary Secretary, three posts\nhave yet to be elected. Elections\nfor the posts of Entertainments\nOfficer, Publicity Officer and\nHonorary Secretary, look likely\nto be delayed until next term.\nMary's Admission\nBY RACHEL WALTERS In a study published this week in\nthe British Medical Journal,\nProfessor Peter Richards, Dean of\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School, has uncovered evidence\nof ethnic discrimination in medical schools' admissions\nproceed ure. The report calls for\nwidespread changes in the\nundergraduate admissions\nsystem.\nThe research team from St\nMary's, also including Chris\nMcManus, professor of\npsychology, looked at the ethnic\norigin of those who applied to\nfive different medical schools in\n1990, and compared the results to\na similar study in1986. The\nreport concludes that people from\nethnic minorities are less likely to\nbe accepted. This is partly\nbecause they were less well\nqualified and tended to apply\nlater, but even after taking these\ndifferences into account,\napplicants were 46% less likely to\nsucceed. The discrimination seems to occur directly from the\napplication forms: the study\nshowed that ethnic origin was\nprincipally assessed from the\ncandidates surnames.\nAs a response to their\nfindings, Richards and McManus\nhave called for a system of\nanonymous application forms to\nbe introduced. In addition, they\ncall in to question the fairness of\napplications that are based on\npredicted A level grades,\nsuggesting that instead candidates sould apply after their\nexams.\nElection Forecast\nBY OW A IN BENN AL LACK After nearly two weeks of\ncampaigning and four weeks of\nhype, the Imperial College Union\n(ICU) elections appear to be in\nthe balance. A poll conducted by\nFELIX on Tuesday and Wednesday in the J CR reveals a hesitant electorate who have yet\nto make their minds up. Four\npositions are due to be elected on\nMonday and Tuesday next week;\nPresident, Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies)\nand FELIX Editor and Print\nUnit Manager.\nOne hundred and three\npeople were polled in all. Interestingly, the results suggest\nthat there may be a relatively\nhigh turnout at next week's elections. More than half of those\nrandomly selected said that they\nwere planning to vote. Whether\nthat number will actually make it\nto the ballot box remains to be\nseen. Those who said that they\nweren't intending to vote were\ngiven a choice as to why they\nweren't voting. The most popular\nanswer by far was that the pol lee was 'Not bothered who wins or\nloses'. Voters also cited disinterest in the Union as a factor.\nOf those who were voting,\nonly rough trends can be\ndiscerned from the results as\napp ox im at ely half the poll ees plumped for 'undecided' for each\npost. When asked what influenced their voting decision,\n'Election Publicity (Posters and\nFlyers)' was cited as being the\nmost important factor in their\nchoice. As to the results: Rachel\nWalters appears to have beaten\noff New Election in the contest\nfor FELIX Editor & Print Unit\nManager.\nFor Deputy President (F&S), Annie Mathewman is favoured\nover Matt Crompton, again disregarding the large number of\nundecided voters. From our poll\nit appears that Luke Gietzen and\nTim Town end are fighting\nvirtually neck and neck over\nDeputy President (C&S) with\nMaryam Yahyavi trailing well\nbehind. Finally, the Presidential\nPosition appears closest of all. No\ncandidate appears well placed,\nwith Miles Ambler and Sarah\nWhite having a slight advantage\nof Kevin Ward and New\nElection. Once again, it should be\nstressed that most people have\nnot yet decided who to vote for\nand that the campaign is far from\nover.\nlil iT J M FELIX03 H1 HR95 "

John Strohm mutters\nsomething inaudible into the mic,\nwhich considering we're all\nstanding within ten metres seems\nto be a waste of time, and then\nthey start. After that verbal\nsmudging he doesn't talk much in\nbetween songs. Indeed Velo-deluxe\nseem instead to group them into\npairs and just play them into each\nother. It's a whirlwind performance\nthat enlivens the tracks from their\nnew album 'super elastic'. However\nthe highlight of the set is a song\nnot available there which concerns\nlobsters (in a roundabout way), and\nis cut from the cloth of a ballad but\ntailored to the shape of an indie\nanthem.\nThe band that follow know all\nabout anthems. Every drugstore\nsingle from 'modern pleasure' to\n'nectarine' has summoned up some\nsort of universal lifeline.\nOn the small pub stage, they\nseemed to have control over both\ntheir material and the crowd that\nbelied the tottering characters in\ntheir songs. You even get the\nimpression that they're in control of\ntheir lives too as Isabel breaks into\nconfessional mode. She tells us\nhow the record company wants\nthem to promote the album coming\nout next month before going on to\nexplain how they're going to play\nsome tracks from their 'second\nalbum' instead. But no matter what\nalbum was invoked, everything they\nplayed was a seamless weave\ntasting of cheap red wine drunk\nwith the best intentions. And under\nthe influence Drugstore kicked\neffortless between their two modes\nof operation; slow and fast. Unlike\nmost other bands however they\napplied both within songs not on\nalternate songs.\nAfter many urging s they finally\nplayed what is perhaps their most\nfamous song; the Flaming Lips'\n'she don't use jelly'. It's a real joke\naffair, confusing jam and vase line, tissues and magazines, lead singers\nand tone deaf guitarists, but unlike\nthe guy who was standing behind\nme don't confuse that for the real\nDrugstore. If you do, the surprise\nwill be on you. At the moment you\ncould be forgiven for placing\nDrugstore in the pack of\n'could bees'. Come March you\nwon't see them for wannabe es. Freedom, Enterprise, Literature, Individuality and expression.\nAre these the words upon which\nthe mnemonic FELIX was\nfounded? Are these the goals that\nthis bastion of freelance articulation\n1 FELIX03 IH HR9S aspires to? I wonder because there\nis a pernicious theory currently\ncirculating within these once\nesteemed confines. It states that if\nmost of the popular press has said\na band is bad than they must be.\nWell, excuse me for having an\nopinion but I don't care one jot\nwhat any journalist (or anyone else\nfor that matter) tells me to believe\nand, at the risk of telling you what\nto do, you probably shouldn't be\nswayed by this review either. All I want to say is that if I like a band\nthen it's because their music moves\nme, touches me in places where\nno-one but my nearest and dearest\ncould hope to reach, gives me a reason to have ears...\nWhich brings me to it bites, a band who have done these things\nto me and for me more than any\nother band. So what if the popular\nmusic press tried to crucify them?\nWhen the drop-dead gorgeous\nguitar riff to 'still too young to\nremember' erupts into life, what\npossible reason can I have not to\nfollow?\nSo what if they were dumped\nby the trendy papers for supposedly\npeddling out-dated, pseudo-progressive rock? Listen to the\nbitter, snarling four minute diatribe\nof 'murder of the planet earth'\nwhich contains the immortal line,\n\"it still is un trendy to be a friend of\nthe earth\" and chew on the irony.\nTake the strains of 'kiss like\njudas' and 'midnight' and try to\npoint me in the direction of another\nrock band that are so meaningful,\narticulate, creative and unique.\nIt Bites were special, at least to\nme (and judging by the sold-out\nvenues around the country for ex-frontman Francis Dunnery's solo\nshows, to more than a few\nthousand others). I'm not living in\nany time zone other than the here\nand now - I'm just giving an\nunashamedly admiring opinion of a best of... collection that sounds\nfresh, free from gimmicks, and\nmost of all, challenging. And for\nthat it gets an unashamed (10).\nI'm looking for an angle, a frame to hang it all in: m usos have\nto think like that, it's not enough to\nbe there, we have to analyse and\ndissect the music. Like all good liars\nwe know that raw experience is just\nrabbit food compared to the\nwaldorf salad of nostalgic\nreminiscence. Or to put it another\nway: we love music so much that\nwe have to turn the live event into\ndead copy, bludgeoned into\nsubmission by the slings and arrows\nof outrageous writing (we're all of\nus vultures at heart).\nOr put it a third and plainer\nway: when you've read one gig\nreview you've read them all; it's opinion dressed up as scripture -the same promiscuous fer v our, as if\nenthusiasm is a disease that's catching - and the best it can hope\nfor is to say nothing prettily.\nYes, yes, you cry, a trifle\nimpatiently, but could I please get\non with it and say something, like\nwhat the band were actually like?\nAt which point I can only lie back\nand think of Elvis, like a good little\nmu so whore.\nsalad are a nice band. They\nsound nice, they look nice\n(particularly the singer Marijne),\nthey wear nice clothes. They have\nlots of songs I don't the words to\nand some of them have tunes and\neverything ... OK, OK, I'm not\nbeing not entirely fair, since the\nsingle 'drink the elixir' is pretty\ncatchy (they play it first, which says\nsomething) and on the whole the\ngig was lots of fun and, well, nice.\nBut then what do I know, just\nbecause I was there? Hang all\nmusic journalists now - you have\nonly your pretensions to lose.\nlive are being hyped by the\nrock press as \"the next big thing\".\nAll the quotes on the cover of their\nnew album, throwing copper, use\nwords like \"impressive\". Listening\nto this myself, I thought \"first track\n... good, second track ... good,\nthird track ... hey are there only two\ntracks here?\" Yes, this album is\nimpressive - I'm impressed by the\nnumber of times they manage to\nrecycle the same riff! Live suffer\nfrom that eternal problem of\nexcellent lyrics with boring non-diverse music.\nAfter playing this for a while I had to check the track number on\nmy cd player 'cos all the songs\nsounded the same. And not only\nthat, they all sound like Soul\nAsylum sung by Michael Stipe. How\nmuch did they bribe the 'famous'\nmagazines to give them 5/5 ? I give them 5/10 - unless, of course,\nthey're better live (groan). 0\n\n"

    "content": "Deputy President\n(Clubs and\nSocieties)\nInterviewer: Andrew Tseng\n( FELIX News Editor)\nLuke Gietzen\nAs the main issue of the campaign so far\nseems to be that of sport, Luke was initially\nasked what his views were on the subject. He\nacknowledged its importance to the job but \"I don't think it should rule it\" he said. \" All the\nother societies ... should have a look in as\nwell\".\nNext Luke was asked if his proposal to\nhelp clubs organise joint meetings would\nmerely add another level of committees. Luke\ndisagreed, saying that at present such inter-clubs concerns rarely come up in Council.\nIt was put to Luke that his manifesto\nwas short on new ideas and seemed to be just\n'more of the same'. \"I think that the ideas in\nthere are all encompassing,\" he replied. When\npressed to explain exactly how he was going to\nimprove communications and get more\nstudent interest, Luke said he would hold\nmore informal meetings with the Major SubCommittee chairs and also \"hype\" the\nUnion's Events and Marketing Manager.\nMoving onto the Events and Marketing\nManager, Luke thought that there was scope\nto improve his services to clubs and societies;\nevents such as Third World First's Brazilian\nnight, which involved a Sol beer promotion,\nwere put forward as examples of past success\nin this area.\nIn closing, when asked what he could\noffer above everyone else, Luke replied \"I think that my policies apply equally to all\nclubs and societies, I'm not just pandering to\nall the sports people\".\nTim Townend\nThe immediate question for Tim was did he\nhave any other policies than his sporting\nones? He replied that his captaincy of the\nrugby club aside, he was also treasurer of the\nExploration Society and in previous years had\ninterests in the Debating Society. He did\nagree however, that the prominence of sport\nin his campaign was because it was\n\"incredibly important\". Yet he emphasised\nthat the 'art side' came first in his manifesto;\n\"we have to get together and make sure that\nthe arts does better\" he said.\nConcerning the Constituent College\nUnions, Tim said that their traditions were\nimportant. \"You can't cut any of them\", he\ndeclared. \" All of them are integral to all the\nstudents there.\"\nWhen asked about his hu sting statement that 'without sport you lose the\nsocial aspect of college', Tim reaffirmed it;\n\"80% of the people who go out have\nsomething to do with sport\". He then went on\nto say that this was the reason that the art\nsocieties needed better promotion. \"We need\nto get high class societies\" he said. One\nexample of this proposal Tim was for a joint\nDramsoc and Opsoc production. Another was\nfor art societies going on tour to visit overseas\nalumni, in the manner of the sports teams.\nIn summary Tim said that he felt that\nhe was in a position to do a good job. \"I want\nto sort this college out before I leave\", he\nended.\nMaryam Yahyavi\nDid not attend the interview.\nFELIX Editor and\nPrint Unit Manager\nInterviewer: Joe McFadden\nRachel Walters\nIt was initially suggested to Rachel that\nalthough she seemed sincere about the\ndirection she wished to take FELIX, she was a 'bit short on detail'. She said she saw the\nnewspaper spilt into two parts: news and the\nrest. News, she said, should reach beyond\nSouth Kensington, although she accepted that\nit was primarily to be concerned with its\nunique Imperial College role.\nShe stressed that although ideas had\nbeen tried before, they could still be tried\nagain and cited in particular the St Mary's situation. She said this was now vital as\nmedical students would soon be here. She said\nthe Editor should not attempt to do everything in FELIX, rather s/ he should establish a 'broad ranging team' who would 'nip back and\nforth across Hyde Park' as required.\nQuestioned about her desire to make\nFELIX more light-hearted, Rachel was asked\nto tell a joke. She failed. She did say that she\nfelt it was unhelpful to pin herself down to\nany particular example publication, and\nstressed that a mixture of content was the\nmost desirable. She said she felt she was 'a breath of fresh air' due to the relatively short\ntime she has spent in FELIX.\nNEW ELECTION IS ALSO\nSTANDING FOR ALL POSTS\nDon't forget you need to use your swipe\ncard to vote in ail departments. See the\nadvertisement on page 9 for exact details. See\nLucy Chothia in ICU for details of how to vote if\nyou haven't got one.\nAlso note that only number count as votes\nEVEN IF YOU ONLY VOTE FOR ONE\nCANDIDATE. Do not use ticks or crosses on the\nballot paper.\nElections\nHow to Vote\nThe Single Transferable Vote (STV) system used\nin the sabbatical elections is designed to make\nthe voting system fairer. Unfortunately, it also\nseems to make things more confused for the\nvoters! In the interests of a general soothing of\nbrains, we outline the procedure below.\nTo win a position under STV, you need to get\nmore than 50% of the vote. If no candidate\nachieves this on the first count, then the\ncandidate with the least number of votes is\neliminated. Their votes are then distributed\namongst the remaining candidates, in\naccordance with the voters second choices.\nSecond choice of candidate? Yes, under STV\nyou can vote for more than one candidate in\norder of preference on the ballot paper. So for\nyour favourite candidate, place a\"T against the\ncandidates name, for the second a'2' and so\non. If you only want to vote for one candidate,\nthen fine. Remember though, that giving a second choice does not affect the chances of\nthe first winning. The second (and third and...)\nchoices are only used if that candidate has\nbeen eliminated from the race.\nAn Easy to Cook Example\nYou are given a ballot paper for President.\nThere are four candidates: Quentin Tarantino,\nOliver Stone, Johnny Wu and New Election. (If\nNew Election wins then the election is re-run).\nSuppose you like Tarantino the best. Stone\nand Wu just don't cut the mustard and so you\ndecide to vote like this:\nOliver Stone 3\nQuentin Tarantino 1\nNew Election 2\nJohnny Wu 4\nAll the votes come in and are counted. They\npoll as follows:\nJohnny Wu 230\nOliver Stone 270\nNew Election 290\nOuentin Tarantino 400\nA total of 1200 people have voted. But the\nwinning line is 601 and nobody got that far. So\nit's time to look at second preferences. Wu is\neliminated as the candidate with the least\nnumber of votes and all his '2's are counted. Of\nthose 230 votes, 1 75 voters put Tarantino as\nnumber '2', 25 go to New Election, 15 go to\nStone and 15 had no preference and so are\ndiscarded. These new votes are added and the\nsituation hots up.\nOliver Stone 285\nNew Election 375\nQuentin Tarantino 585\nNon Transferable 15\nThis still adds up to 1,200 but now the winning\nline is 593 (half of 1,200-15+1). Still no-one\nhas a winning quota, so Stone's votes are\npassed around as before. If any of Stone's votes\nwent to Wu, his votes are now passed out\naccording to third preferences. Looking at\nStone's votes, 200 go to Tarantino, 35 got to\nNew Election and 50 are non-transferable\n(there were no further preferences). A quick\npiece of number-crunching gives:\nNew Election 350\nQuentin Tarantino 785\nNon Transferable 65\nWe have a winner! Surprise surprise, Tarantino\nscoops another award and an ICU Presidency\nawaits him.\n0\n3\nIDAR95 FELIX HI\n\n"

Why is this? What\nare the factors that make the one-year\nadvanced course student potentially vu lner a ble?\n\u2022 A common pattern of MSc courses (with a few exceptions) is two terms of intensive\nteaching culminating in a set of examinations\nfollowed by a major piece of project work.\nClearly any disturbing life-event coinciding\nwith the heavy teaching component of the\ncourse can have a quite disproportionate\nimpact on a student's academic progress. An undergraduate or a research student dealing\nwith exactly the same sort of problems may\nwell, other things being equal, be able to\nabsorb a period of academic under-performance, simply because there is more time\navailable.\n\u2022 Many masters degree students have\nreturned to university after an extended\nbreak from academic study, usually after a period of employment. It is not uncommon\nfor people who have previously had a successful and buoyant academic experience at Alevel and at first-degree level to be very surprised at the extent to which they have\nslipped out of the academic mode, and to find\nthat the necessary adaptation is a good deal\nmore demanding than they had expected.\n\u2022 A high proportion of advanced course\nstudents are self-financing, and have taken on\nquite large debt commitments to pay college\nfees and their living expenses for a full 12\nmonths. Occasionally students take on these\nextra debts before they have had the opportunity of clearing debts incurred while they\nwere undergraduates. Older students, sometimes with onerous family obligations, have\noften given up well-paid work to come back\nto college, but find that state provision for the\nfamily is inadequate.\n\u2022 Students sometimes use masters degree\ncourses to vindicate something in their past.\nFor example, someone who achieved a class\nof first degree lower than he/she had expect-ed, or who had been disappointed at not\nobtaining admission to the university of\nchoice after A levels may well have, as a perfectly valid component of motive, a powerful\nneed to prove something to him or herself.\nIn these circumstances the prestige and\nstanding of Imperial College can be highly\nseductive, and conversely the fear of failure\ncan be very disturbing.\n\u2022 For a significant number of students\nreturning to university after a protracted\ninterval, a masters course coincides with\nother major upheavals in life, and may indeed\neffectively be a vehicle for hopes and ambitions for the future which go well beyond the\nconventional notion of acquiring an extra\nqualification. This 'fresh-start' component of\nmotive is entirely valid and healthy in itself,\nbut does imply that any worry about completing the course successfully carries extra anxiety. \u2022 Students on a masters degree course are\nlikely to be far less homogeneous than an\naverage departmental undergraduate intake.\nPeople are of different ages and backgrounds,\nfrom different countries, different disciplines,\nand different universities. This sometimes\nmeans that peer-group support, or indeed the\nnormal opportunities for friendship, are not\nso assured. This, and the pressure of work,\nmay effectively exclude the student from a balanced social life.\nThis coincidence of short, highly intensive courses, and a fair proportion of students\nwith complex personal and family obligations\n(as well as complex motives), seems to me to\ngive a certain urgency to dealing with problems if they arise. Masters degree students\nneed to feel secure in the choices they have\nmade, to feel an underlying confidence that\nthe course is what they wanted when they\nenrolled, and that they will be successful in it.\nSeeking help\nIt is, I think, normal to feel a certain reticence about 'asking for help'. Postgraduate\nstudents, almost by definition, are coping,\ncompetent and successful people, and it certainly goes against the grain to have to\nacknowledge that one is having difficulty.\nBut once that barrier of pride is overcome\nand there has been a proper dialogue with the\nright people, the rewards can be immediate\nand considerable. If, for example, one particular part of a course is proving worrying ly difficult, there is a real danger that the anxiety\nwill halo over on to other parts of the course\nunless the matter is properly discussed with\nacademic staff. Similarly, research students\nshould not underestimate the importance of\ntalking to their supervisors properly if they\nhave become unhappy about their progress.\nThings can sometimes be changed very e as i ly, once a problem has been identified.\nStudents often perceive academic staff as\nbeing overwhelming busy - which may be\nobjectively true - but it is also quite often a rational is ation for a fundamental reluctance\nto face up to potential trouble. So far as academic worries are concerned, the key people\nare the student's own teachers or supervisors.\nEvery department in college also has a designated Postgraduate Tutor, who has an overriding responsibility for the pastoral care of\ngraduate students, in just the same way that\nthe Senior Tutor has for undergraduates. The\nCollege Tutors - Dr Gareth Jones in Physics\nand Dr Margaret Goodgame in Chemistryhave a college-wide responsibility of the same\nkind and may be approached directly.\nHowever, there are other people in college on whom you can make demands - and I am one of those. My work is entirely confidential. I can see people quickly - usually on\nthe same day - and I am paid to do nothing\nelse but talk to students. I strongly believe\nthat talking is very important in a crisis. It is\na relief in itself to talk through one's anxieties\n- to share the worry if you like - in a safe\nplace. It is a way of identifying problems\nclearly, and it sometimes throws up new ideas\nfor dealing with difficulties. My office is at IS\nPrinces Gardens, and my telephone number\n(direct dialling) is 071 594 9430.\nOB fl W FELIX WM\n\n"

    "content": "Standby\ntrivia\nPerhaps Oliver Stone should take\ntime out, hold his breath, count to\nfifty and then sit down to watch\nquiz show. He might learn a thing\nor two. The point is that you don't need to over blow the media to\nsend it up; they do it for you and\nhave done so ever since the first\nblack and white pictures flickered\nacross the bakelite box.\nThe heart of Quiz Show's message is that America lost its\ninnocence long before Jack\nKennedy lost the back of his head.\nIn the 1950s, when technology\nalways got better and all children\nwere above average, over half the\nviewing public watched quiz shows.\nThey were all american, clean\nshaven and educational too. Hence\nthere was more than just a little\ndisquiet when it was revealed that\nthe show, 'Twenty-One', had\ncoached its participants with the\nanswers beforehand.\nDirector Robert Redford\ncaptures many aspects of the affair;\nfrom the rejection of the show's old\nchampion, a working class Jew, for\nan Ivy League lecturer (impressively\nplayed by Ralph Fiennes), to the\nthrill of the congressional\ninvestigation that finally brought\nthe story to light.\nIt's been nominated for four\noscars and is one of the most\nintelligent and witty films to have\nbeen released this year. As the\ntrailer says; \"the media made them\nsuperstars\" ... satire anyone?\nPostcards from america is\nbased on the autobiographical\nwritings of David Wajnarowicz and\nso the film is a reflection on his\nhomosexual life; a childhood spent\nwith an abusive father, his teens as\na hustler in New York and his adult\nlife on the open road. Although this\nmeans that the film has a tendency\nto switch backwards and forwards\nto different stages in David's life,\ngiving one more of an impression\nof a series of unrelated events\nrather than a conventional plot.\nThe sub story which deals with\nDavid's teenage years is perhaps\nthe most interesting since it is here\nwhere the film offers some much\nwelcomed comic relief. A rather\namusing scene is when David and\nhis friend attempt to mug a man\nwhom they meet on the street. The\ntwo young teenagers call out to the\nman, encouraging him to\napproach, while concealing a knife\nbehind their backs. The man takes\noff his glasses and starts talking to\npostcards from amer/ca\nWm\u00aemm\nmm\nthe teenagers. As the conversation\nprogresses, it becomes clear that a mutual attraction is developing.\nHowever, just when David and his\nfriend are about to follow the man\ninto his apartment, the knife slides\ndown the trouser leg of his friend\nonto the floor. The man becomes\nso panic-stricken that he refuses to\nlet the two young teenagers into his\nhouse.\nPostcards From America is a powerful film in the frankness with\nwhich it deals with its subject\nmatter. The film contains scenes\nwhich stick in the mind long after\none has left the cinema. The rape\nscenes and the events surrounding\nDavid's childhood abuse by his\nfather are disturbing, whilst some\nscenes are erotic and others simply\nleave you frowning with\npuzzlement.\nAlthough it cannot be\nclassified as light entertainment,\nPostcards From America is a worthy\nfilm which deals with the topic of\nhomosexuality in a compassionate\nway.\nFirst we had Bram Stoker's Dracula. Then it was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Now, continuing the\nfilm industry's cool plan to make\nmore money from book tie-ins, we\nhave rudyard kipling' s the\njungle book. Actually in this case\nthe name is misleading, as this live\naction version of the much loved\nstory of young Mowgli, raised by\nwolves in the Indian jungle, is\nabsolutely nothing like the Kipling\nversion. As I recall his hero was a boy of about seven, not a strapping\n26 year old Chinese-American\ntipped for super stud status,\nshowing off his pecs at every\navailable opportunity and playing\ntonsil hockey with the daughter of\nthe local British commander. Nor\nindeed in the original was there a mad schoolteacher, here played\nbrilliantly by John C/ee se, who\nteaches Mowgli how to be an\nEnglish gentleman. This presumably entails not covering yourself in\nbaby oil and slipping into a posing\npouch. These pretty serious plot\ndisparities apart, the film is quite\nenjoyable, and is a triumph for\nJason Scott Lee, last seen in\nDragon: the Bruce Lee Story. This\nguy is serious heartthrob material\nand is set to be a huge star so\ncheck him out while you can. Q bag-ladies and mr men\n\"There is a growing desire to be individualistic and make one's own\nfashion statement.\" (Verdict's report in 'clothing retailers'). Hence the\nconstant evolution of ever more extravagant fashion themes, the\nsuccess of the designer and the bankruptcy of the dedicated leader of\nfashion. To avoid this last option, remember that accessories will\nalways be the key to catching the eye of the beholder while\nmaintaining your own individual style.\nHot on the heels of the post-war revival, the season's essential is\navailable in every play school dressing-up box - the clutch bag. Westwood's are outsized and shiny, Versace's come in discrete pairs of\ndelicate pastel hue. The keys to individuality are extremes of colour,\nsize and materials: palest pastel or vibrant brights; outsized or tiny;\npatent, satin or fur. Anything remotely reflecting the original notions of\nconservative discretion gets a big thumbs down. Best buys in the\noutlandish are at Wilson's in Camden Road or por fob e//o rd market.\nWhile wandering the latter, look out for a wealth of big bargains\nin Summer fashion. For a40's edge buy floral print, dog's tooth check\nand pastel tones. Skirt lengths remain at the knee, but any attempt to\nlook stylish requires the tightly fitted variety - leave the flowing cottons\nfor the frump ish and the indie-kids. For casual week-night clubbing\npick up old-style sports tops and team them up with little skirts and\nknee highs. Alternatively, a talkative promoter somewhere is\nconvincing the world that Johnson's baby powder is done with and Mr\nMen are now the thing. Buy your woolly hats and lycra T shirts (\u00a315) at\nmiss selfridge on High St Ken. I suggest Little Miss Naughty for the\nVixens, and for the rugby club, that really irritating long-armed orange\none whose hands get everywhere. 0\n0\n3\n(\n1\n1\n1\n)\n1\n1\n9\n5 FELIX WM\n\n"

Most of our new members fly\nevery second or third weekend.\nSpring is probably the best time\nto learn to fly as the weather is\nstarting to improve, plus we are\nrunning a special offer again this\nyear, if you join the club, we give\nyou a free trial flight.\nIf anybody is interested in\nlearning to fly, or just wants to find\nout more about us and what it's like to spend your weekends\nsoaring for hours above England,\nwith nothing but the birds for\ncompany, come along to any one\nof our regular meetings, thursday\nat 1 pm in aero 266 or e mail me\nto find out more.\nAndrew Fowler\nAero II\n(a. fowler@ic.ac.uk)\nLetters may be commented on by a guest editor, whose opinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor, and cut\ndue to space restrictions. Deadline: Monday6.00 pm. Well, it's election time again, and\nthe college is filled with the false\npromises of another bunch of\nsycophantic posture rs. Nothing\nnew there. The three presidential\ncandidates seem divisible only in\nterms of sex, and levels of idiocy.\nDid anyone read last week's mundane selection of\nmanifestoes? Were there any real\ndifferences between their policies?\n\"I promise to prevent the union\nmove to Sherfield. I promise a referendum on the NUS affiliation.\nI promise to be accessible to\nstudents...\". These were the words\nof Miles Ambler. These were the\nwords of Kev Ward and yes, these\nwere the words of Sarah White!\nWhatever happened to originality?\nMost laughably, all of the\nclone-di dates promised to\n\"improve the commitment to the\nConstituent College Unions\",\nwhich \"provide a vibrant identity\nfor their members, a vital part of\nIC life\". Surely it is time that a sabbatical candidate was actually\nprepared to stand up and tell the\ntruth? That the CCUs are an\noutdated anachronism, a feeble\nexcuse for a few people to knock\nup some CV points while swigging\ngallons of ale at the expense of the\nUnion. That they provide a vibrant\nidentity for only that small, selfish\nminority who need a silly scarf to\nbolster their lack of personality?\nWhere, I ask, is the vital part of IC\nlife supplied by the CCUs? Well,\nlet's look at the evidence. CCUs\nhave their own societies; but surely\nthese could be run directly through\nthe College Union, thus saving on\nbureaucracy and money. The\nCCUs provide the College with\ntheir own magazines. Magazines?\nSurely a magazine would actually\ncontain information, rather than\ndross. It is not for no reason that\nBroadsheet is commonly known as\nBroadshite. The CCUs apparently\norganise important events: such as\nthe Annual Engineers' Ball, which\nbombed out last year and lost the\nUnion thousands of pounds. The\nCCUs apparently provide for the\nwelfare of the students. Surely the\nUnion itself provides sufficient\nwelfare facilities.\nMost of all, people will claim,\nthe CCUs provide camaraderie\nbetween the appropriate parts of\nCollege, provide a social arena,\netc. Really? How many people\nactually get involved in the CCU\nactivities? How many students\nwould dare to admit to chanting\nthe Boumalaka, for instance? In\nmy first year I, with all other Guilds\nmembers, was subjected to this\nritual. The response then, as now,\nfrom the majority was \"SAD!!\". The\nregalia, the mascot ry, the rivalry,\nall are totally outdated - students\nnowadays have far more important\nthings on their minds. If any body\nprovides what the CCUs claim, it\nis the Overseas Societies\nCommittee. It boasts a huge\nmembership, organises many\npopular events (such as the very\nsuccessful International Nights)\nand provides an important forum\nfor those with similar interests and\ncultural heritage.\nAdmittedly, once upon a time,\nwhen IC was populated solely by\nyoung men with too much money\nand no sense at all, the CCU\nactivities may have been popular,\nand the 'legendary' rivalry may\nhave been more than a pathetic\nfantasy. Now, however, the CCU\nactivities are enjoyed only by their\nown committee members, who do\nit purely to satisfy their selfish\ninterests and get pissed. They are\nignored or positively derided by\nthe rest of the Student Body. In the\nrecent Guilds hustings, for\ninstance, only candidates and\ncommittee members were present.\nAnd how many students voted? I dread to ask.\nSo why doesn'ta presidential\ncandidate offer to put them out of\ntheir misery? It seems likely that\nanyone who actually dared to\npromise the abolition of CCUs in\ntheir manifesto would be assured a landslide victory. After all, the only\npeople likely to vote against such a move are the constituent College\nUnion Committee members\nthemselves.\nMarcus Alexander\nThe opinions expressed in \"Cat & Mouse\" do not necessarily reflect those of FELIX or its editorial staff.\nIf you want to make a contribution, contact FELIX on x48072 or come to the office in Beit Quad.\nQ3I T1HR95 FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Backchat\na Cosmopolitan woman E ven in these days of equal\nopportunities, few women gain access to the\nmen's club of physics.\nBut among the cast of Imperial\nAlumni stands one woman who\nhas made it into the higher\nechelons of this exclusive world. I took the train down to Brighton to\nspeak to my old personal tutor, Dr Sandra Chapman.\nI arrive in the middle of a tutorial. Dr Chapman sits with an\nintense project student in front of\nswirling images on a computer\nscreen, and waves me in the\ngeneral direction of the one chair\nthat isn't littered with paper. Two\ndusty cactus plants sit by the\nwindow overlooking a green ly dripping campus (it's been raining\nfor days) and the whiteboard is\ncovered in the kind of multitudinous mathematical scrawl we\nexpect of scientists. A variety of dog pictures\nadorn her office walls; \"Huskies?\" I wonder\nout loud. No, they turn out to be wolves. The\nanxious student leaves, mildly reassured, and\nI switch on the tape-recorder.\nPhysics\nAs a young woman, Sandra Chapman had a lot of people telling her that physics was not\nwhat she should be aiming for as a career. But\nbeing the sort of person who \"had her own\ntelescope at the age of fourteen\", she won a scholarship to Imperial and went on to carve\nout a glittering career as a physicist. She is\nnow head of the highly respected Space\nScience Centre at the University of Sussex,\ncarrying out research on particle dynamics in\nthe earth's magneto tail, simulations of space\nplasma collisions and analysing spacecraft\ndata. At 33, she's young to be where she is\nand says wryly that \"a few people died\" in her\nresearch group not long after she arrived -the legacy perhaps of a faculty that was\ncreated in the late 60s from young blood and\nhas been steadily edging towards retirement\nage ever since.\nLast year Dr Chapman won the\nprestigious Zeldovitch medal for her work on\nplasma dynamics of the earth's magneto tail. She is unmistakably proud, and her voice is\nanimated as she describes her work:\n\"The earth's magnetosphere is basically\nan unstable system. You're feeding energy in\nfrom the front end, from the solar wind, and\nit's stored in the back end, which is the\nmagneto tail. It's a bit like the way you store\nenergy when you stretch a rubber band.\nSomething, which we do not quite\nunderstand yet, causes the 'rubber band' to\nsnap, and collapse back down towards the\nearth. That injects a lot of energy into the\nnear earth system. It causes damage to\nsatellites, and disrupts radio\ncommunications. One of the things we're\ntrying to do is predict when this will happen\n- it may happen by sudden changes in particle dynamics. The breakthrough that we\nmade was in being able to set up a problem\nthat is time-dependent for the first time. I was working on this problem and so was a group in Russia - we were in direct\ncompetition, and I beat them to it!\"\nSexism\nThe medal is not her only accolade. In 1990\nCosmopolitan magazine honoured her with\ntheir award for 'Woman of Tomorrow' under\nthe science and technology umbrella. Her\nphoto sits alongside those of a group of young\nand talented female rising stars in the pages\nof the magazine, and each year she's invited\nto the 'Women of the Year' luncheon. \"It's a good opportunity to set up contacts for my\nstudents\" she says dryly.\nHer tone belies the fact that besides\nbeing a passionate researcher, Dr Chapman is\nalso an active and dedicated teacher. As an\nundergraduate, I had the dubious pleasure of\nsitting through one of her lecture courses,\nand the even more dubious pleasure of her\nfierce tutorials - she was not someone who\nhad much time for students with an attitude\nproblem (I wasn't in love with physics). Since\nthen she has taken a little pity on floundering\nfirst years, and has installed in the library a series of backup videos of her classes. Her\npioneering method might be popular with\nstudents, but so far it doesn't seem to have\ncaught on with the rest of the\nfaculty - the men seem to be\nrather shy about being on\nrecord for all eternity.\nBut how easy is it to be a woman in a field that is almost\nexclusively male? \"There are\ncertain individuals who do find it\na problem. It's very easy for them\nto cope with women at a lower\nlevel - students - but they find it\ndifficult to accept that women\ncan take on management roles.\nHowever, they are a minority,\nand there are a lot of men who\nare supportive of women who are\nmoving up the ladder too.\n\" The one example of\nsexism I can actually think of is\nBritish Antarctic Survey (BAS),\nwho until this year have refused\nto allow women to winter on\ntheir camp in Halley Bay. For\nyears and years all the other\ncountries would allow their women to\noverwinter, and there were excuses [from\nBAS] that they couldn't have separate\nfacilities and all this kind of stuff. This year\nthey're allowing women - but only in pairs.\nAnd of course you can't find two women\nwho're available to go down at the same time!\nSo there are still no women who've\nover wintered with BAS. That's where this\nmacho thing comes in, in this rugged, 'let's sit on the polar ice cap for two years' type of\nstuff.\"\nHowever, there are problems. \"In order\nto progress you have to go through this\nperiod where you are working on contract,\nand every two or three years you are moving\naround. It would be very difficult to train as a physicist if you did not do that, and so you\nend up moving all over the world. It's very\ndifficult to organise that with a partner. It's interesting to note that all the male faculty\nmembers I know have wives who are in the\nkinds of jobs where they follow them. So you\nfind that the man has the lectureship and the\nwoman has the job as a teacher: she's the one\nwho has the hours which suit the kids, she's the one who can move from one end of the\ncountry to the other, and she's the one who\ncan have the career break. I do know some\ncouples where they're both scientists - the\nwoman has gone off and taken a very short\ncareer break, immediately come back to work,\nand they've paid a lot for the child care. I do\nnot know of anybody who's taken two years\noff, and then come back to science.\"\nAnd so, like most women in science,\nSandra Chapman is herself caught by the\ninherent unfairness of this system and is\nfacing a tough decision.\nEM FELIX03 U1 HR95 "

Last\nyear it was like this...\nDay 13, 9:3:94\nNot really a qualifying day. Owain puts\nup his new poster; it has his face as a jigsaw\npuzzle with the caption, \"Put the pieces into\nplace...\" underneath. Owain likes it because\nthere's a nice oppressive use of his face and\nthe fact that he doesn't look like a girl. He\ntries to make me go and pile flesh again -tonight it's Selkirk and Tizard - but I'd rather go home and watch the football.\nHe has his 'editorial first lady' for\nsupport at least. *\nDay 14,10:3:94\nToday is the foamy one; St\nMary's hustings. We get booked on\nthe union minibus at 5.15 and head\nover the Serpentine with a very\nnervous group of prospective s abs, most of whom are getting as drunk as\npossible. In a prophetic way Dan Look\ngets his glass removed from him so\ninclined is he to its temptation.\nThe conversation ranges from root canal\nwork to vomit and the effect of bananas on a queasy stomach. A dozen queasy stomachs\nimmediately smell bananas and lurch in time\nto the DP's driving. Owain says how glad he is\nto have come by minibus. My scepticism\nreaches a high.\nFinally we're allowed out and the smell\nof bananas is replaced by the fumes of Praed\nStreet. We get into Mary's bar and Owain is\nstraight into mode - you're less vulnerable on\nthe move is his theory - so he starts putting\nposters up.\nSlowly the room fills up to 20%. It's already past 6 and there's still more IC people\nhere than Mary's.I think we should go for it\nand at least keep our skins. Unfortunately the\nMary's President [Marc Swan] goes to drum\nup hecklers and we wait for another 20\nminutes. It's invaluable time for Dan to\ningratiate himself with the barman. 'Oh what\na lovely pint, I think I 'll have another.' Owain\nparades around, handing out flyers and\nsmiling nicely. He's so pat he just keeps going.\nThen the pre-clinical s wander in. They're a hardened, confident bunch - all talk\nof sphincters and smears. Someone asks me\nwho's wearing contacts, not that he really\nwants to know. I get the feeling it's just the\nprey er cornering the hunted early on. Finally\nall is set up. The beefy medics are as far back\nas possible so they can shout more loudly it\nseems.\nAnother nervous proposer's speech is\nover quickly. Owain is heckled on his\nfeminine side - a woman's section to FELIX\nis proposed. Owainfieldsthese early bouncers\nwith a flourish and we go out in a cloud of\nsatisfaction. Joe gets up and is immediately\nflan ned! Post McFadden, it's question time.\nOwain trundles down the front to meet a flan;\nnow that the destroying team is organised. I stay well back and protect my goatee. The\nquestions are pointed but well defended until\na query about chromosomes. A medic comes\nforward with a hypodermic and a colleague\ngets Owain's arm for a impromptu blood test.\nThey don't want to vote for a transvestite but\nthe suggestion of just dropping his/her\ntrousers is ignored. Only the 'ethical'\nintervention of Mary's President saves our\nher a from his fate.\nDay 18,14:3:94,first day of voting\nJoe is not seen all day and Owain\nbecomes increasingly concerned about what\nhe's doing. A lot of the Science\nCommunicators appear to be out of bounds,\ncharging up to people and asking them\nquestions to get them to vote for Joe. I walk\naround looking for various friends doing the\nsame thing for Owain. I only manage nine.\nOwain wants me to get out there and get more\npeople to vote for him but I'm not happy\ndoing that and, the closest we been to an\nargument looms. I can see his means-end\nrationale but I'm really not interested. If Joe\nshould win, good luck to him - the college will\nget what it voted for. Personally I think Owain\nwill win by about 200 votes.\nOwain even persuades Paul that he is\nabout to lose and the pair charge around\ncanvassing like mad. Owain cai is me a \"juvenile living in a fantasy world\" which\ndoesn't really bother me but by the end of the\nday there's enough panic around to float the\nTitantic.\nDay 19,15:3:94.\nsecond day of voting\nI don't see Owain until 4.50.\nHe's out and about talking to a punter. Paul is working another bit\nof the walkway. Andy Wensley\nrushes past, pausing only to say\nthat results are due at10.30 and\n00.\nIn the office things are\nnervous - even I have butterflies.\nOwain doesn't turn up until 7ish.\" \u2022 \u2022\nfazed. He thinks he has lost. So does\nOwain. I don't get into the bar until\nlOis h and am immediately forced to buy\na round. Owain is swann nig through the\ncrowds quoting Shakespeare, speaking\nearnestly to people he has never met,\nfluttering his eyelashes - totally drunk. All the\nother candidates are equally wetted. Only\nMaria looks unconcerned, perched on a stool,\nred wine in hand. Dan is floating. Ian starts to\nget rowdy.\nWe sit in the bar from 10 to 11.30. On\noccasions Dave Goddard [DP] comes down to\ntell us; \"not long\", \"only ten minutes\", \"only\nfive minutes\". We get thrown out of the bar\ninto the lounge. Finally at 11.45 a group of\nnervous, drunk people are approached and the\ncandidates are asked to go upstairs.\nHush\nAndy W comes down to give out the\nresults. President is first - it's just a blur of\nnumbers. How could Paul Thomas do so\nbadly? What were the new election figures?\nNo-one can believe Lucy has won except for\nthe three people who cheer.

At hustings w last Monday and Wednesday, sabbatical candidates subjected themselves to intense scrutiny by those present. Mary's issues, the new Ba\nbuilding and the forthcoming merger with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, were of particular concern both north and south\nissues raised included the proposed move of Imperial College Union to the Sherfield building and the NUS.\nKing's President May Lie Again\nBY ANDREW SMITH Following a veiled attack on\nLucy Chothia, ICU President,\nGhassan Karian, King's Student\nUnion President, has been\nelected President of the\nUniversity of London Union( ULU) by 52 votes to 18.\nThe dramatic events took\nplace at a meeting of UL U's General Union Council, in which\nUL U sabbaticals were elected.\nOpening Tuesday's meeting, an\nanonymous statement was read\nby the chair which implied that\nMs Chothia had been slandering\none of the candidates. The statement, which could not be\ncontested or debated, continued\nby suggesting that everything the\nICU President said could not be\ntrusted.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Lucy\nChothia denied the allegations.\nHowever, senior union officials\nare concerned that recent events\ninvolving Ghassan Karian and\nLucy Chothia, may have a detrimental effect on relations\nbetween ICU, King's Student\nUnion and UL U next year.\nAfter recent events involving\nthe King's President and his\nexecutive collectively lying to\nICU, the prospective UL U President was asked to explain\nwhat conditions would lead him\nto lie in his new role. Querying\nthe relevance of the question to\nhis election and its effect on the\nvoters Mr Karian admitted that\nhe would on occasion tell \"fibs\"\nthough he insisted that he would\nattempt to tell the truth as often\nas possible.\nEarlier the only contested\npost, that of Vice President\n(Finance & Societies), went to\nanother King's sabbatical.

And so it is\nthe time when you just cannot afford to take\ntwo years off. I think some women may be\npushed out of academia and into jobs in industry which then cease to be science jobs -they become management jobs. In this\ncountry it's worse, too (I'm thinking of the\nnumbers of women that I know who have\nchildren and are renowned scientists, and\nthere are more of them in France and in the\nStates - 1 know of very few in this country).\n\"I'm now 33 and childless, and I think\nI 've more or less decided that I'm not going to\nhave children.

I found it very\ndifficult [at Greenham] because... there is a whole group of feminists who feel that women\nshould not be involved in what they see as an\narea which has been mismanaged by men and\nis fundamentally flawed in its philosophy (in\nthat physics produces weapons of mass\ndestruction). They tend to see you as someone\nwho has suspect morals because they don't do\nphysics and don't know what it's like.\"\nSo she found herself getting into some\ninteresting discussions as she tried to explain\nwhat physics is really about, and why it was\nimportant for her to be at Greenham.\n\"To say 'scientists shouldn't work on\nso-and-so because so-and-so is bad' will fail,\nbecause scientists don't know what they're\ngoing to be working on from one year to the\nndra hap man talks to\nTamar Khan\nnext.

She blames the\nbroadcasters. \"It's something invented by the\nmedia.

    "content": "\u00a9WQffQQQQ\nInternational Night 1995\nKeys: Culture, Music, Food\nIt's that time of the year again, when IC students from all over the world perform what\nhas often been the largest and most popular\nstudent-organised event in the Imperial\nCollege calendar. International Night is\norganised by the Overseas Students'\nCommittee (OSC) and it involves most of the\ntwenty-four overseas societies that are functional at the moment within IC Union. Imperial College has a huge diversity of cultures and ethnic groups. It is known as one of\nthe most multi-cultural academic institutions\nin the world with nearly one third of its students being of non-British origin.\nInternational Night consists of a 'Cultural Show' where societies will be performing traditional music, songs, dances\nfrom their home countries. Some have chosen\nto stage a martial-arts demonstration and others will have a fashion show where tradition-al, original costume and more contemporary\nclothes will be on display. The Jazz-Dance\nclub will also be performing.\nThe Cultural Show of International\nNight '95 is going to be a huge success as\nmost of the tickets have already been sold,\nand the great enthusiasm and ability of the\nperformers are bound to have you singing\nand dancing along. The more material (and\nsome say more filling) counterpart of the\nCultural Show is of course the famous Food\nFair where one can sample, taste or even get\nstuffed with traditional food of countries\nfrom all over the world. People tend to go for\nthe food first, so you'd better get there early.\nIn order to make International Night a killer\nnight out, there will also be live bands playing until midnight and the ever so popular\nInternational Night Disco will go on until\n2am the bar staying open until the same\ntime.\nInternational Night happens today, all\nover the Sherfield Building. Doors open at\n6.30pm. The Food Fair is in the Main Dining\nHall( M DH) until 7.30pm. The Cultural\nShow starts at 8.00pm in the Great Hall, finishing approximately two hours later.

You must present IC\nstudent identification to get IC Student\nprices.\nKeys: Phantom, Grease, Saigon\nNearly 200 members of ArtSoc have had an\nenjoyable and busy year. Curtains opened\nwith a visit to the loud and colourful Grease\nand the bangs continued at the Albert Hall\nwhen the Royal Philharmonic let off a few\ncannons and played a few classical tunes on\nGuy Fawke's night. Everybody has enjoyed\nthe old favourites: Les Miserables, Phantom,\nMiss Saigon; we've bopped with Buddy, and\nbeen stunned by Starlight Express, in its\nrevamped form. As for plays we were thrilled\nby Agatha Christie's long-running Mousetrap\nand amused, not a little, by Tony Slattery in\nthe lost-on-an-island comedy Neville's Island.\nThe Queen and I was good - but the book was\nmuch better! Before Christmas we saw an\nindescribably amazing production of The\nNutcracker at Saddles Wells. This interpretation was fun but the traditional classics beck-one d. The enchanting tale of the swan and\nthe prince charmed all who saw Swan Lake at\nthe Royal Opera House. On a cultural high\nwe returned to Covent Garden to see Cosi Fan\nTutte: Armani'sun shapely costumes featuring\nin Mozart's opera. Hamlet at the newly\nnamed Gielgud theatre was wonderful; it\nmanaged to keep us enthralled for four hours.\nAmongst our trips to look forward to are\nOliver, Starlight and Phantom - if you've got\nanything you want to see come along to our\nMonday lunchtime meetings (Union Dining\nHall). Thank you to all our many members\nwho are making this such a successful year.\nArtSoc elections will be held on Monday\n13th March so if you'd like to help run the\nclub next year, come along! For our members\nthere will be an excellent (and free) buffet\nlunch.\nq jj jjb M0i Artificial Life\nKeys: A Life, Robots, Stupidity\nOn Wednesday March8,1995, the IEEE Imperial College Student Branch is holding a seminar on Artificial Life. The event will\ntake place in the Clore Lecture Theatre,\nHuxley Building and will run from 1.30pm until 5pm, with a break for refreshments.\nExamples of A Life, man-made systems\nthat behave similarly to living creatures or\ngroups, are being used in many disciplines\nand are proving effective on traditionally\nimpossible problems. A Life is a rapidly\nevolving area of study in both industry and\nacademia with a long future ahead of it; the\nseminar will be a snapshot of the state-of-the-art.\nWe are aiming the talks at a wide audience because A Life is such a broad field,\nwith applications in environmental and\nfinancial modelling, network communications and many other useful areas. The audience will be presented with widely differing\nviews from speakers whose backgrounds\nrange from academic research and industrial\ndevelopment to philosophy.\nProf. Igor Aleksander will open the semi-MM FELIX03 mR R95 "

A little known French painter from the\nlate 19th century, and a contemporary of many of the\nfamous impressionists, much of\nRedon's work is now on show at the\nRoyal Academy. Inspired by writers\nsuch as Poe and Baudelaire, his\nwork is imbued with a disturbing,\nnightmarish taint of unreality.\nFor most of his life he spurned\nthe use of paint, preferring to\nscratch and score at paper with\ncharcoal, leaving rough, sooty\nimages from his fantastic al mind.\nFigures drift and cower beneath\nblackened, looming landscapes\nwhilst his lurid notions of angels\nfloat above. Characters from stories\npose bleakly, grim and metamorphosed by the dreams that\nsurround them. Above all, the\nimage that recurs is that of the\ndisembodied head. It flies past,\nwinged and grimacing; it soars\nabove the land, spherical as the\nmoon, or sits, transmuted into a spider. This image, redolent of the\nartist's own memories of his father\nbeing beheaded, haunts almost all\nof these burnt out landscapes.\nMore accomplished, yet in\nmany ways less interesting, are\nRedon's later works in colour. On\nshow are some skillful pastel still\nlives of flowers, wherein the colour\nis used in an almost childish\nmanner; boldly vibrant, with pure\ntones shimmering in wild splashes\nabout the picture. His enigmatic\nvisions, when translated into\ncolour, lose their ominous sense of\nforeboding, gaining instead an\noverpowering luminosity. Whilst\nthey are stunningly visual, these\ncolour pictures lose their sense of\nspirituality in their shamelessly\ntinted tones.\nOverall Redon's art leaves you\nwith a mixture of wonder and\ndoubt. It is intriguing and deeply\nsinister, but it doesn't have the\npower behind it to be thought of as\nreally great, or very lasting. Redon\nwas an anomaly, an intriguing one\nat that; but nothing more. 0\nf FELIX03 fT in R95 "

But please\nremember that when this started,\nnine sensible individuals (and\nNew Election) set forth and, I believe, made a genuine pledge to\ntry to improve things.\nThat four of them turned up\nwithin half an hour at your room\nin hall last night was annoying I agree; that they promised\neverything you asked but then\nfailed to return this morning with\neither money, beer or an absence\nof clothing is, yes, regrettable;\nthat the massive increase in hot\nair subsequently set off the fire\nalarms and forced you to stand\noutside in the cold street and\nga wp at the s pod from the kitchen\nwho appeared to be partnered\nwith a lithe/strapping girl/boy in\na bathrobe/bin-liner was more\nentertaining, true; BUT ultimately they were all human\nonce and I think deserve our\nattention.\nSpend a moment to study\nwhat they've said, written and\ndrunk in the last two weeks and\nthen go and vote. It'll only take\ntwo minutes and, who knows,\nyour vote may make a positive\nchange. Perhaps they'll even\nabolish elections next year! But\nwe should all vote in this one.\nEaster Issue\nThere are only two more issues\nFELICE S this term. There will\nplans for the event until two\nweeks ago.\nIn response, M rMer shin suggested that the committee\nwere out of touch with their\nmembers, and he blamed their\nown incompetence and apathy\nfor their withdrawal. The letter\nof complaint, dated February\n23rd, was only received by\nMer shin last Monday, having\nbeen sent to the wrong person.\nWhen questioned by\nFELIX, Andreas said that he\nbe an issue as usual next week,\nand then we are skipping a Friday\nto give us time to prepare a bumper issue for the last\nWednesday of term. The deadline\nfor submissions is as usual, next\nFriday. So if you have any articles\nyou would like to submit before\nthe end of term, then please come\nand speak to me as soon as\npossible. And if you didn't realise\nthat the end of term was so near -trust me, it gets worse with age.\nPhoenix\nPapers are currently up, opposite\nthe Union office, for anyone\ninterested in editing Imperial\nCollege's arts magazine Phoenix.\nAs one of last years co-editors, I can vouch for the endeavour\nbeing great fun and, in addition,\nit's a lot easier justifying 'weird\narty stuff in an arts magazine!\nThe hardest thing of course\nis getting contributors, but they\ndo appear from amongst the\nwoodwork. People seem to treat\nthe magazine surprisingly\nseriously and in fact nearly fifty\npeople came into the office to get\na copy before they ran out the day\nwe distributed last year.\nConference\nAmongst the usual sporadic stop-start activity in FELIX TOWERS during the last few\nweeks, there has been a subsection of quiet determination.\nTotally separately from us (except\nin as much as they all write for\nFELIX, use our photocopier,\nphone, fax, envelopes, pens and\nmy patience) three individuals\nhave, with steadfast calm,\norganised what I think could be\none of the best events of this\nacademic year.\nanticipates that the event will be\na huge success. Defending his\norganisational skills, he said:\n\"Nobody else has had any\nproblems, nobody else has\ncomplained, everybody else is\nhappy.\"\nWhile dealing with the\ncontinuing financial complexities\nof organising the event, Dan Look, Deputy President (Finance\n& Services) commented: \"There\nhave been some small problems\nbut I still think it's going to be a So what's it about?\nThe Philosophy and Ethics of\nscience.\nInteresting huh? Yes! As we\nhave discussed in various\nFELICE S this year (parti-cula rly co-organiser Samin's 'Political Science' column) fundamental questions remain un answered of science and tech-no logy. In particular - should\ntechnology be used with out\nregard of moral issues? Many of\nus study - and indeed lecture and\nresearch - at Imperial oblivious to\nthe applications of our field in the\nreal world. (Except perhaps in the\ncase of the large number still\nfunded by military concerns!)\nOn a similar note, the\nconference considers Science as\nReligion. This isn't as wacky as it\nsounds; it is simply asking how\nscience has come to hold such a position in our society that its\nviews are taken as 'gospel'. The\naverage Western man looks to\nscience for answers and although\nsome recent trends, such as\nenvironmental awareness and\neven the bleak cyberpunk fiction\nmight indicate this faith is\ncracking, the fact remains that\nscience has easily the broadest\nchurch in the First World.\nIf you disagree with this, or\neven if you don't understand it\n(and I vacillate myself), then why\nnot go along and make life\ndifficult for those who will be\ngoing to agree with each other?\nThe conference takes place on\nSaturday, 18th March and has at\nits core a series of discussion\ngroups, where these issues will be\ntackled on a intimate level.\nJoseph Weizenbaum from MIT, brilliant night.\" He admitted that\nthey would need to sell almost all\nthe tickets before the event would\nbreak even, but felt that this\nwould not be a problem after the\nhuge success of last year's cultural spectacular.\nTickets are available from\nthe J CR during lunch, or from\nthe Union office throughout the\nday.

'The medium is the message' trot out the galaxy of\nmedia commentators who have sprung up in \u00a9IMuhan's wake.\nUnfortunately they appear to have little understanding of what it\nmeans.\nPerhaps in some glib sense they might realise that this means that\nthere is a qualitative difference between literary (the novel) and tele visual forms (the\nmini-series) but the massive implications of the statement go much further than\nwhat concern traditional media. UlcLlltldll is not limited to the issues that our grandparents can't understand the content of the modern electronic media because it is\nnot a linear, single view point system. Oh no. On a far wider level IDcLllhSTI cuts into\nthe whole decaying edifice of technology critiques.\nThe full force of the statement 'the medium is the message' is that the message (or content) of a technology is inherently tied to that medium (or technology).\nAn example IDcluhaDgives in Understanding Media (1964):\nAn electric light bulb is a medium, but one inherently without a message. The\nonly way you can make this medium carry a message is to invoke another medium,\nie using it for morse code signaling invokes the medium of morse code and all its\nassociated syntax. Hence the light bulb's message is determined by the characteristics of its medium. Of course some might reply that the message of the light bulb is\ndemonstrated by the scenes it enlightens. But IDcLllhan retorts that it doesn't matter\nwhether the light is used for brain surgery or baseball practice, as it is the medium\nof the light bulb (the fact that it provide light) which determines the human uses it\ncan be put to, not any particular message or content of the light bulb.\ndivide of:\n(Muhan's concepts...\nHeart\nReason Imagination\nabstract logic Imaginative\nintuition\nRenaissance \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nperspective \u2022up ect sv: with a single depicted with\npoint of view out l unie Linear se que n Metaphorical\nti al thought Vsimii'\nsp nste it i Science with Religion with\nknowledge as\nThe person who boosts \"Personally I pay no\nattention to ads\" has already proved himself\na liar.\nThe effects on technology do not occur at the level of\nopinions or concepts, but alter the sense ratios or patterns of perceptions steadily and without any resistance\nThe content of a movie is a novel or a play or an opera\nthe effect of the movie form is not related to its pro gran content.\nBy continuously embracing technologies we re!\nselves to them as servomechanism. That is why\nto use them at all, serve these objects, these ext\nourselves, as gods or minor religions.\nFor those of you interested in the philosophy and\nethics of science, this happy c happy is here to\nremind you that on the 18th of March, there's a day\nconference in College.

The\nformer lead to his disgust\nat the godless rationalism\nof science, whilst the latter demonstrated to him\nthe effects of large technological systems on the\nindividual.\nIn the 1930's IMuhan\ntravelled to Cambridge,\nwhere he was strengthened in his agrarian tendencies by the (in)\nfamous figure of F.R. Leavis. It was from such\na background that his\ncriticism of the Industrial, Yankee, Northern\nAmerican states, in contrast to the genteel\nSouthern states, came\nabout.\nHowever [Mllhan's reputation was made\nwith his studies of modern mass media. Such\nbooks as The Gutenberg\nGalaxy (1962) and\nUnderstanding Media\n(1964) became highly popular.\nSoundbites like 'the\nmedium is the message'\nand 'the global village'\nonly go to prove how\nright fT t cLu han was in his\nassessment of the mass\nmedia.
