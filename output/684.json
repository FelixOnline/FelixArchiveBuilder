    "content": "Mooney\nprices up\nDear Sir,\nSeveral weeks ago College imposed an\napparently small 2% refectory price increase.\nIt may seem there is nothing to complain\nabout, but few people can realise the\nridiculous way such increases are decided.\nWage rises are easy to identify, but College\nhas no way of analysing the cost of raw\nmaterials. Until the end of last year College\nused the Financial Times Shopping Basket\nIndex to fix their prices. This was not a very\nreliable guide, as housewives use far more\neggs and less chips than the IC refectories,\nbut it was better than nothing. Unfortunately\nthe Index no longer exists.\nWhen last year's sabbaticals tried to\noppose a price rise, arguing that some\nsensible policy on pricing needed to be\ndeveloped, College ignored them. They had\nno negotiating strength. College had made a decision and would not change it. I guess the\nsame happened this year, although as I no\nlonger sit on the Refectory Committee I cannot be certain.\nCollege have tried to introduce a computerised accounting system for the\nrefectories. Due to various mistakes, it still is\nnot used. The system could monitor the price\nof raw materials and so indicate when price\nrises are needed.\nTo make progress in this area the Union\nmust take a lead. It is no use expecting\nCollege to solve the problem. It does not\nharm them if prices go up by an exes sive amount. It only hurts students. College will\njust continue to ignore the Union if we go into\nRefectory Committee and ask nicely for\nchange. So I will be proposing a motion at the\nnext U GM instructing the Executive to call a refectory boycott should College impose any\nfurther price rises. This will hopefully\nencourage the College to solve the problem,\nbecause every time the Union has held a Refectory Boycott in the past, the Union has\nwon. The College will not want the risk of\nanother defeat.\nThis motion should mark the start of a new\nrealistic approach to negotiating with\nCollege. At present student representatives\non College committees have no real power as\nCollege can always ignore their wishes. The\nthreat of militant action will make the\nCollege listen to students.\nYours sincerely,\nD Hugh Southey\nRefectory Committee Rep 1983-84\nSub\nStandard\nDear Sir,\nAlthough this may appear to be both\nembittered and spiteful I feel I must say a word or two about our delightfully chummy\nsub-aqua club.\nThis being my first year at Imperial I decided I would take advantage of the\nfacilities and having some experience in\nSCUBA diving felt I would join the college\nclub. So I ventured down to the introductory\nmeeting; on the whole a fairly pithy affair on\nwhat is and isn't diving and what the club\ndoes and doesn't do. From what I discovered\nthe latter of the two would be the fairest\nasses ment. Having unwisely parted wo th my money\n(\u00a33) I embarked on some polite conversation\nwith some of the senior officers of the club.\nFrom the word go they outlined quite\nemphatically, 'This is a social club! We like to\ndo a bit of training etc., but what we really\nlike to see is everyone together down the bar,\ndrinking pints, and talking wet suits... I 've got\na big fat rubbery one, what's yours like?'\nHaving emphasised in the introduction on\nthe dangers of the sport and the need for a responsible attitude (a point I totally agree\nwith) why did the majority of the club's executive decide to turn up pissed, beer\nglasses in hand, swaggering into the room\nlike a bunch of cowboys?\nTalking to the club's diving officer about\nclub outings he said: 'We only have perhaps\nthree outings a term. Why don't you come\ndown to the bar later, se if you get on with us,\nand if we allow you to join the 'team' (read\nclique) you'll stand a much better (certain)\nchance of getting on a diving trip. Due to the\nnumber of unofficial members that tag along,\ngenuine Imperial College students stand little\nchance.\nAdmittedly these are serious accusations\nbut let's consider these points:\na) Imperial owns what is commonly accepted\nas one of the best equipped sub-aqua clubs in\nthe country\nb) It recieve s a considerable amount of\nfinance from the Union\nc) This money seems to be squandered on a very small number of people\nThe club is dormant (three trips a term is\nnot enough) and ill-managed by a bunch of\ncowboys.\nYours humbly,\nEverard Snivel\n(real name supplied)\nDear Sir,\nContrary to apathetic belief, I would like\nto announce that there really is a10 pin\nbowling club in existence at the college, and\nthat every able-bodied man, woman and ?\nshould come along. See random small ads,\nposters, etc.\nYours sincerely,\nCaptain Fantastic\n(real name supplied)\nFELIX\nMascotry is one of the oldest traditions at\nImperial College and, like it or not, it is here\nto stay.\nAt its best, mascot ry promotes healthy\ncompetition between the CCUs and provides\nan outlet for high-spirited enthusiasm. It\nshould help to foster pride in the College and\nits traditions.\nAt its worst it may lead to frightening\ndisplays of violence and riotous behaviour\nand the prospect of damage to people and\nproperty.\nTo guard against this danger it is essential\nthat a clearly defined set of mascot ry rules\nexists, that each party plays to the same rules,\nand that the rules are observed.\nThose in authority in the CCUs should be\nac cutely aware of this responsibility and\nshould seek to make the position quite clear\nto those they represent.\nThere are not many Colleges in the country\nwhere mascot ry would be tolerated to the\ndegree that it is at IC. Those who count\nthemselves supporters of mascot ry should\nguard this pri vili ge as jealously as they guard\ntheir mascots.\nStudents have found it more difficult than\never this year to find flats and beds its. What\nwere once cheap flats are now converted into\nluxury ap partments; students are starting to\nsquat in disused buildings.\nThese disturbing facts, coupled with the\nimpending closure of the Fremantle Hotel,\nmake it clear that an accommodation crisis is\nlooming.\nPlans are afoot, it it true, to build a new\nhall of residence, but this cannot be expected\nto appear for a few years.\nThe College and the Union must start to\nthink seriously about how they are going to\nhouse next year's Freshers, and how they can\navert a major crisis in the short term.\nAcknowledgements: Thanks to Ajay, Dave\nJonesfJon Jones, J Martin, Hugh, Diane (for\nfolding FELIX every week), Grenville,\nDamian, Andrew, Pete Coleman, Chris\nMartin, Pete Hands, Rosemary, Tony,\nKishor, Richard, Neil Harris, Anne-Marie\nMartin, Nigel, Pete, John Martin.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of\nImperial College Union Publications Board and is printed\nby the Union Print Unit, Imperial College, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1984.

In an un pre ci dented move Prof Sayers went to his new\nposition directly from the\nhead ship of Elec Eng. At the time\ncynics, including most of DoC's academic staff, were of the\nopinion that he didn't know\nenough about the latest research\nin DoC, since his field of research\nis electrical engineering applied\nto medicine. The reason given for\nsuch an unorthodox appointment (head ships are normally\npassed round senior academics in\na department on a 'Buggin's turn'\nprinciple) was that the Rector\nconsidered the department's research had become concentrated in too narrow a field. Some\nbelieved that perhaps this was an\nenlightened decision on the part\nof Lord Flowers, but it seems\nthat those who took the opposite\nview have been proved right. The\ndepartment's morale is slipping,\nthere have been major semi-public rows between senior\nacademics and the new head, and\nthe general bad feeling which has\nbeen created is starting to\nadversely affecting undergraduate teaching.\nStoic, the Student Television of\nImperial College, is an\norganization which has long been\nthe butt of many jokes in Union\ncircles. This small but extremely\nearnest bunch of dedicated\ncameramen, sound record is ts, producers, directors, presenters,\ninterviewers, etc make weekly\nnews and entertainment programmes. Unfortunately this\nis largely for their own benefit (to\nboost their chances of a career in\ntelevision) since their 'campus\nnetwork' is so limited more\npeople are involved in making\nthe programmes than watching\nthem! Neither are they renowned\nfor being overly competent,\nalthough the biscuit was well and\ntruly taken last week when they\nrang up the FELIX Office and\nasked us to look in the 'Diary'\npage and tell them which\nprogrammes they were showing\nthis week!\n20 Friday 26 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

Then why not join the\nImperial College Y HA group, and come\nalong on one (or several) of our fortnightly\nescapes from the city?\nEvery other Friday evening we leave\ncollege, and spend Friday and Saturday night\nin a beautiful part of England or Wales;\nusually in a Youth Hostel. Saturday and\nSunday are spent walking in the surrounding\ncountryside enjoying the scenery, fresh air\nand rural calm. This term we have already\nhad a successful trip to the Dorset Coast,\nand further trips are planned to Snowdonia,\nthe Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales and\nSouth Wales. We always aim to be back in\nLondon for last tubes on the Sunday night.\nIf you like the idea of joining us, come to\none of our weekly meetings on Thursday at\n12.30pm in Southside Upper Lounge.\n'Butties' and coffee are available, and you\ncan find out more about our activities. In\naddition to the walking trips we also arrange\ncinema and theatre trips, pub crawls and\nsimilar social events. We hope to see you\nsoon at one of our meetings.\nMICRO\nIf you by chance happened to miss the micro-club stall at the Fresher's Fair, or if you\nsigned your name on the interest list and\nhave forgotten all about us, then read on.\nThe club exists to provide members with\nan opportunity to use equipment that they\nprobably wouldn't be able to afford. We\ncurrently own two BBC model B's( equipped\nwith disc drives), aN AS COM2 with 48K RAM, an Epson FX100 dot matrix printer, a high resolution graphics plotter, an E PROM burner and several video monitors.\nYou may be under the mistaken\nimpression that all the club cares about is\nplaying games, but we do cater for the\nhardware enthusiast too. We have a full\nrange of tools and a number of projects\nneeding attention: examples are a robot-arm, aN AS COM disc interface, a speech\nsynth is is er and 'BORIS'; an antiquated 6800\nmicro cum put er system.\nAll the equipment is located in our own\nroom, number 401 in the Mines building and\nthe advantage of joining the club is that\nmembers can have access to these facilities\nat any time that the building is open.\nNew members or those interested in\njoining might like to come along and make\nsome suggestions on what hardware we\nshould buy, or any event you think we should\nhold in the future.

If you are interested, meet under\nBeit Arch at 6.30pm, Friday, 26 October,\nbringing \u00a31 worth of dairy/Kosher food.\nThere will of course be a series of speakers\nthis term. An important date to note is\nThursday 15 November, when Julian\nSorsby, Executive Director of Ravenswood\nVillage for the Mentally Handicapped, will be\ncoming to talk at IC.\nHopefully a trip will be organised at some\npoint to the first Jewish Film Festival which\nopens at the National Film Theatre this\nweek.\nDon't forget, if you are a fresher, the free\nKosher lunch is STILL AVAILABLE.

    "content": "SINGLES\nTom Robinson: Rikki, Don't Lose That Number\nTom has one of the best\nvoices in the business, and on\nthis latest single he uses it to\nthe full. He's had a rough time\nover the years, shunned by the\nmusic press for being gay, and\nshunned by the public for\nbeing 'arty'. Hopefully, after\n'War', this will be his 2nd big\nsuccess.\nHazel O 'Connor: Cuts Too\nDeep\nDragged from obscurity to\nstardom by the film'Breaking\nGlass', it had seemed Hazel\nhad returned to her roots with\nbland songs, and no enthusiasm, but with'Cuts too\nDeep' she regains her old\nvitality and appealing voice. I still prefer 'Will You' but don't put this down too quickly.\nKeep it for late at night \u2014\nalone. Then listen again \u2014 it's got wonderful lyrics.\nPaul McCartney: No More\nLonely Nights\nOK, so it's Top 10 already,\npossibly even No 1 by the time you read this, but I 've only just\ngot it, and I had to review the\nbest single by my favourite\nartist in many years. Go stuff\n'Pipes of Peace' Paul; this is\ninfinitely better. Simplicity,\nmelody, quality: If only he'd put a decent end on it, instead\nof leaving the film soundtrack\nguitar fade, I would have no\ncriticisms. Album's out this\nweek. Buy it!\nEddy Grant: Soys In The\nStreet\nNo-one seems to know what\nEddy is doing these days.\nObviously fed up with waiting\nfor a new release, his record\ncompany have remixed this\nfrom 'Going for Broke'. Hardly\nsurprisingly it's not up to\nmuch. 'Wish I was back in\nWest India' Grant sings. Maybe, that's where he's gone?\nEnglish Evenings: Tear You\nDown\nAfter the minor success of\ntheir first single 'What's the\nmatter with Helen', Graham\nLee & Lee Walsh have spent a year on a debut album 'After\nDark'. If this first taster from it\nis representative, it's going to\nbe pretty hot. Very club by. Very funky. Very dance able. Watch out for the 12 inch\nDorian Gray mix. Good stuff.\nCINEMA\nConan the\ndestroyer\nThe film opens with Conan\n(Schwarzenegger) still pining\nfor his lost love Valeria. Soon\nhe is waylaid by the treacherous (and dead sexy)\nQueen Tar amis( Sarah Douglas). The queen promises to bring Valeria back\nto life if Conan accompanies\nher niece Princess Jehnna\n(Olivia D'ub a) on a quest for a magical key that will unlock a mysterious treasure. Conan\nreluctantly sets off with the\nprincess and the queen's chief\nguard Bombaata. There after\nthe plot is totally convention-al, the hero having been\nrecruited, accomplishes the\nmission only to find on return\nmuch treachery and evil,\nlargely in the form of the\nhideous (or is it hilarious?)\ngod Da goth whom he\npromptly vanquishes.\nThis film bears little\nresemblance to its predecessor\u2014 'Canan the Barbarian'\u2014\nin which its director (Milius)\ngives the mythical element of\nthe Conan story much more\ngravity. This myth is played\ndown in Destroyer, both by\nthe Screenwriters and Fleischer (the director), in\nfavour of a tongue in cheek\nadventure. This I think is a shame, as it was this very\nmyth/story telling style, as\nhandled by Milius, which gave\nBarbarian both its power and\noriginality. Barbarian was also\nan adu It movie, unlike Destroyer. The characters\nand their relationships were\ndeveloped in the more rarefied moments of the film\nand this emotional content\nnot only gave the film depth\nbut also heightened the set-pieces of action when they\nZZREVIEWSD\ncame. Barbarian also showed\nconsiderable style in its\nhumour and even its violence.\nIn short Barbarian had 'class'\nand it's exactly this class that\nDestroyer lacks.\nOne might sympathize with\nFleischer who, though conventional, is still totally\nprofessional and necessarily\nskilful given some bad casting\nin the form of Grace Jones\nand Tracey Walter (Malak).\nThe Producers doubtless pushed Fleischer for a teeny-bopper s movie.\nBut for all this, its still a jolly\ngood romp and very enjoyable\n\u2014 if you let it be. And you can\nleave the cinema safe in the\nknowledge that 'the good' will\nalways dismember any mutant muppet that dares\ndeclare itself a god and virgins\nrule.\nyour n^i wi fh \u00ab\" lo6 Demanding\ntraining,\nearly responsibility,\nhigh rewards.\nMars Confectionery is a market leader in an extremely\ncompetitive consumer sector, and\na technology leader in a highly\nsophisticated, progressive\nmanufacturing environment.\nOur management trainees\nare selected from the highest-calibre graduate output, for initial\nopportunities in PRODUCTION,\nENGINEERING, SALES,\nMARKETING, FINANCE,\nSUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT\nSCIENCES, and possibly R&D.

    "content": "IN THIS\nALIEN ENVIRONMENT,\nSPACE TECHNOLOGY\nIS OUT OF ITS DEPTH\nInspecting underground gas pipelines for faults may not sound like the\nultimate high-tech challenge. But, in fact, the task proved to be beyond the\n'state-of-the-art' technologies previously\navailable \u2014 even in military and aerospace applications.\nPROBLEM:\nDesign a vehicle which can travel\ninside the pipe, carrying equipment\ncapable of identifying any significant\ndefect, and pinpointing its position to\nwithin a metre in a run of up to a hundred\nkilometres or more.\nSOLUTION:\nTHE INTELLIGENT PIG\nThe Intelligent Pig, developed by\nthe gas people, is a vehicle carrying highly advanced sensing, data processing and recording equipment. Driven\nthrough the pipe by the gas pressure\nwithin it, the Pig can be used without\ntaking the pipe out of service.\nWhat is more, it can not only pinpoint any defect on the inside or outside\nof a steel pipe,but even describe its nature.\nHOW?\nUsing strong magnetic fields or\nelastic waves propagated at ultrasonic\nfrequencies, different types of sensors\ncan detect corrosion, cracks, impact\ndamage or distortion of the pipe. But\nthe real challenge lay in processing the\nhundreds of millions of signals produced\nby the sensors in an average run.\nTHERE WASN'TA COMPUTER\nSMALL ENOUGH AND TOUGH\nENOUGH\nMany of the pipes to be inspected\nare less than 305mm in diameter. To fit\nsufficiently powerful data processing\nequipment into the tiny space available,\nhybrid micro circuits incorporating\ncustom-designed silicon chips had to be\ndeveloped. And since the space restrictions also limit battery size and therefore\npower, many of these highly advanced\nelectronic components have to operate\nat the very limits of their specifications.\nWhat's more, the environment inside\nthe pipe isn't exactly friendly. All the\nhighly sophisticated equipment carried\nby the Pig has had to be designed to\ntolerate or be protected from extreme\nvibration, mechanical shock, dirt, and\ngas pressure of up to 70 atmospheres.\nA TOMORROW'S WORLD'TAPE\nRECORDER\nThe sheer volume of data to be stored\ninspired the development of what is\nprobably the most advanced ultra-mini at uri sed tape recorder currently in\nexistence. Making extensive use of sub-miniature hybrid microelectronics, new\ntypes of recording heads and ultra-precision mechanical engineering, this\nlittle marvel can store up to 500 million\nreadings on a single reel of standard\none-inch tape,with an accuracy of better\nthan one-t bou s and th of one percent!\nFROM REEL TO REELS\nOnce the Pig has finished its run, the\nnext job is to prepare the data for analysis by powerful, advanced computers\nsuch as the VAX ll/780.There's so much\ninformation in the Pig's tiny recorder\nthat many reels of computer tape are\nneeded to receive it, and many hours of\ncomputer time to analyse it.\nTHE RESULT\nBritain's underground gas transmission network is a multi-billion pound\nasset. And the technical pyrotechnics\nwe've just described have a thoroughly\ndown-to-earth end result\u2014they help the\ngas people to maintain this asset more\nefficiently and cost effectively.\nWHY THE GAS PEOPLE LIVE IN\nTHE FUTURE\nThe fact that gas is Britain's most\npopular domestic fuel - and a powerful\nand growing force in industry, too-is the\nresult of many years'foresight,planning\nand massive investment by British Gas\nscientists and engineers. And they're still\nworking for the future\u2014to meet Britain's energy needs in the next century.\nTHE GAS PEOPLEWORKING FORTOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY\n\n"

Pour the fat into a deep-sided baking tin and\nput in the oven. Get the sausages ready and have the batter\nhandy \u2014 the hotter the baking dish when the batter goes in the\nbetter the result. After the onions have cooked for five minutes\nadd the sausages and batter. Return to the oven. DON'T LOOK for 20 minutes.

A special tribute was also given to\nthe sixth form teachers who\nensue the receipt of 'a large\nnumber of applications that fit\nthe exacting entry requirements\nof an institution that is dedicated\nto academic and professional\nexcellence at the highest level'.\nHe continued by elaborating\non the 'interface problem'\nbetween the sixth form curriculum, because school\nstudents 'come up inadequately\nprepared to study for an honours\ndegree', and the narrow range of\n'A' Level subjects required by\nUniversities. There has however\nbeen a compromise as all the\nUniversities are now committed\nto AS level courses which are\nintended to broaden and\nsupplement the A level\ncurriculum. Lord Flowers is keen\nto see the implementation of AS levels in order to 'get rid of the\nevils of over-specialization'.\nFollowing an attack on the\ngovernment education policy,\nwhich has lead to 'damage from\nwhich the Universities are\nunlikely to recover for a long\ntime', he praised Sir Keith\nJoseph, Secretary of State for\neducation who originally proposed AS level courses.\nBo on\nBlue Peter\nThe City and Guilds Union\nmotorised mascot 'Bo' is to\nappear on the BBC's Blue Peter\nShow on Thursday.\nBo will be appearing alongside\nthe only other car of its type still\nin existence, as part of the run up\nto the RAC London to Brighton\nrun.\nThis year's run, for veteran\ncars marks the 50th anniversary\nof Bo joining C&G.

    "content": "CAREERS \u2022\nInterviews\nHow to\nSucceed\nHere are a few basic instructions which are\nprobably known to most of you but for the\nfew not in the know\u2014\nBE PREPARED\nEmployers are looking for motivation\ntowards the type of job for which you have\napplied and for motivation towards their\ncompany. Nothing irritates them more than\nwhen you apparently don't know what you're\napplying for or why.\nRe-read the employer's literature the night\nbefore and jot down any questions you may\nhave. Re-read your application form and\nimagine the sort of question you would ask if\nyou were the employer. Practise answering\nthese questions. Think of the worst question\nyou might be asked and decide how you\nwould answer it.\n'Where do you see yourself in five years\ntime?' 'What would you say were your\nstrengths and weaknesses?' (you don't have\nto tell them the worst thing about yourself,\nthink of a 'positive' weakness!) What made\nyou choose this job (our company)? 'Have\nyou enjoyed your course at IC?' (Remember\nyou should be an we ring positively!)\nDRESS SMARTLY First impressions are tremendously\nimportant and we're told that some students\nstill go to interviews in jeans.\nDRESS COMFORTABLY Yes, you do need to be smart but its hard\nto present your best image when your feet\nare killing you or your collars stiff and new\nand digging in.\nDRESS APPROPRIATELY\nWhilst the dark blue suit, white shirt and\nsombre tie might be perfect for the firm of\naccountants, it might look a we ens y bit out-of-place if you're going for a job in a disco.\nDON'T BE LATE Allow plenty of time for the pre-booked\ninterview room to be changed to another on\nthe other side of the campus; for the train to\nbreak down; or for you to have a wash and\nbrush-up so that you can arrive looking\nsmart and relaxed.\nBE POSITIVE\nQuestion: Do you have any experience of\ncomputing?\nAnswer: Er, well, not really, I er, I only went\non a six weeks FORTRAN course but I only,\nsort of, urn, learnt the basics, not much\nreally...WRONG, lets try again\nQuestion: Do you have any experience of\ncomputing?\nAnswer: Yes, I went on a six week\nFORTRAN course which taught me the\nbasics. I enjoyed it (but only say this if you\ndid!)\nPractice now making positive statements\nabout yourself trying to avoid negative\nqualifications like, 'only, not really, just'.\nMANIPULATE There may be some facts about yourself\nwhich you think are particularly relevant to\nthe job for which you are being interviewed.\nMake sure the interviewer knows about\nthem before you leave the interview room. If\nyou've had relevant vacation work, make\nsure he's aware of it in some way, by perhaps\nreferring to it in your answer to a question. If\nyou've read their brochure, make sure the\ninterviewer knows.\nBE POLITE, FRIENDLY AND INTERESTED\nTreat the interviewer as you would a guest\nin your home. If you shake hands, try not to\ngive either the wet-fish touch or the numb-hand squeeze! Look interested in what the\ninterviewer is saying even if they're telling\nyou something you already know. Thank\nthem for their time as you leave but there's no need to grovel!\nSECOND INTERVIEWS\nThese are normally held on the employer's premises and may include an evening meal,\ngroup discussions, case-history exercises,\nin-tray exercises, letter writing exercises,\npsycho metric testing and interviews with\nmanagers, psychologists and Uncle Tom\nCobbley and all. One firm which I visited last\nSummer reckoned that candidates could be\ninterviewed by as many as ten different\npeople in one day.\nThe Carers Advisory Service run a seminar on second interviews in the Spring\nTerm and we also have a hand-out about\nthem, but here's a couple of tips to be going\non with:\u2014\nDuring the group discussions you get NO points for saying nothing and you get even\nfewer points for hogging the show and failing\nto listen to the others.\nRegardless of what employers might tell\nyou, they will be observing you all the time,\nso try not to get drunk or throw your soup at\nthe managing director. Best of Luck!\nCareers\nadvisers\nWhilst I would never say that all careers\nadvisers are brilliant at their jobs I do think\nthat many are misjudged because of the\ndifference between the student's expectation of our role and the adviser's view\nof his or her function.\nElsewhere in FELIX is an article .about\ncareer choice. Careers advisers can help you\nat every stage of that process. We can help\nyou in many ways but we can't do it for you.\nIt's your job, your life, your decision.\nCareers advisers are totally impartial. We\nare not your parents or your teachers, we\nhave no axe to grind. We have knowledge of\nthe job market, of selection procedures etc\nbut we don't know a lot about you and you're\nthe most important factor in career choice.\nCareers advisers can listen, ask\nappropriate questions, help you find the right\nsources of information, start you on the\nprocess of decision making, suggest other\nareas you can look at, help with applications,\ngive 'mock interviews', show you the\nmechanics but we can't do the work for you.\nYou can meet the College Careers\nAdvisers in many places. We're always at the\nex-Students Careers Evenings run by the\nCollege Associations; one of us is always at\nthe Lunchtime Careers Talks, anxiously\ncounting heads, looking at our watches to\nsee that the speakers don't overrun (or\ntrying not to look too cheesed off when the\nspeakers are appalling). We run the seminars\non Wednesday afternoons; one of us is\nalways in the library from 4.30pm to 5.30pm to answer quick questions, glance over\napplication forms or CVs, or you can book to\nsee one of us for an interview. There's no\nrestriction on the number of advisers you\ncan see or the number of times you can see\nthem.\nFELIX Friday 26 October 1984 13\n\n"

Or there is\nalways the Sony Walkman.\nRight, so the Walkman is out\nof batteries, the person next to\nyou has rampant halitosis,\nand you never carry reams of\npaper or a word pro ces or. What you need is some poems\nto read. Oh, yes you do.\nIt goes something like this:\nA poem may well be about\npeople wandering lonely as\nclouds, comparing their friends to summer days and\nmincing about snivelling into\ntheir hankies. If you find one\nlike that, you can always tear it\nout and use it as your hanky.\nFair enough, but there is the\nother kind.\nWhen a writer decides that\nan idea has to go into this\nformat, he must use language\nat some density. Think it out\n\u2014 a short story uses five\nthousand or so words to put\nacross either a point, or\nsomething which reads like\nthe outline of a bigger book. A good poet can say anything\nhe has to say in perhaps two\nhundred words, and that is\nwhy you need to carry poems\nalongside your rail card. They\ntake hours to read and re-read, and take up a lot less\nspace than 'War and Peace'.\nSo let's go. Where do we\nstart?\nLet's say 20th Century only. A lot less trouble that way. And\nwho could be better than blunt\n\u2014 speaking Ted Hughes?\nGo for it, Ted:\nThe Jaguar\n(extract)\n...tiger and lion\nLie still as the sun. The boa-constrictor's coil\nIs a fossil. Cage after cage\nseems empty, or\nStinks of sleepers from the\nbreathing straw.\nIt might be painted on a nursery wall.\nBut who runs like the rest past\nthese arrives\nAt a cage where the crowd\nstands, stares, mes meri sed, As a child at a dream, at a jaguar hurrying enraged\nThrough prison darkness\nafter the drills of his eyes\nOn a short fierce fuse. Not in\nboredom -The eye satisfied to be blind in\nfire,\nBy the bang of blood in the\nbrain deaf the ear -He spins from the bars, but\nthere's no cage to him\nSimple enough at first\nglance, but read it like you\nplay records \u2014 over and over\nagain. Then you can follow\ndifferent threads on each\nreading (base line, harmony,\nsinger, rhythm). Just to start\nyou off: the slow, sleepy\nopening is set in short\nsentences, which makes it\nappropriately slow to read.\nOnce the jaguar is introduced,\nsentences run into each other\nconveying urgency. The sound of phrases is put to\nwork. Try saying: 'Stinks of\nsleepers from the breathing\nstraw.' and then: 'By the bang\nof blood in the brain deaf..'\nSee what I mean?\nHmm. Lecture over. Hughes\nisn't the only one fired-up by\nthis Force-Of-Nature bit. Put\non your Richard Burton voice\nand stick a leek on your lapel.\nDylan Thomas, take the\nstage...\nThe Force That Through The\nGreen Fuse Drives The\nFlower.\n(Extract)\nThe force that through the\ngreen fuse drives the flower\nDrives my green age; that\nblasts the roots of trees\nIs my destroyer.\nAnd I am dumb to tell the\ncrooked rose\nMy youth is bent by the same\nwintry fever.\nThe force that drives the water\nthrough the rocks\nDrives my red blood; that dries\nthe mouthing streams\nTurns mine to wax.\nAnd I am dumb to mouth unto\nmy veins\nHow at the mountain spring\nthe same mouth sucks.\nIt might be fun to spend a holiday standing on a Welsh\nmountain in a thunderstorm,\nhowling this theatrical verse at\npassing farm animals. Certifiable, I admit, but it\nwould make a change.\nThen there is TS Eliot. He\nwrites HUGE poems. Well, he\ndid, anyway. Despite his\ninterest in reincarnation rituals, he is still six feet under.\nIt is difficult to do justice to his\nstuff in a small space, but this\nis a bit of one of the earlier\nones.\nThe Love Song of J Alfred\nPrufrock\n(extract)\nLet us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread\nout against the sky\nLike a patient ether is ed upon\na table;\nLet us go, through certain\nhalf-deserted streets,\nThe muttering retreats\nOf restless nights in one-night\ncheap hotels\nAnd sawdust restaurants with\noyster-shells:\nStreets that follow like a tedious argument\nOf insidious intent\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question...\nOh, do not ask, 'What is it?'\nLet us go and make our visit.\nIn the room the women\ncome and go\nTalking of Michelangelo.\nReading Eliot will give you\nthat shell-shocked, soulful\nlook that people mistake for\ndeep appreciation. Look the\npart, and the rest will follow. A different type altogether is\nThorn Gunn. He likes writing\nabout motorcyclists and their\nexistential methods of\nsuicide. Might sound contradictory to you, but who\ngives a toss \u2014 this is art.\nMister Gunn gets the last\nword:\nThe Feel of Hands\n(extract)\nThe hands explore tentatively,\ntwo small live entities whose\nshapes\nI have to guess at...\nThere is a sudden transition:\nthey plunge together in a full-formed fury: they are grown\nto cats, hunting without\nscruple;\nthey are expert but desperate.\nI am in the dark. I wonder\nwhen they grew up. It strikes\nme that\nI don not know whose hands\nthese are.\n(Faber & Faber publish\npaperback anthologies of\nthese poets, and lots of others.\nHave a look at Ezra Pound, WH Auden, Stevie Smith, Philip\nLarkin, and anything that\ncatches your imagination.

This obviously\nmade the whole game rather\nslow, the only real excitement\ncoming from P Hollin's colossal\ndriving.\nSNOOKER\nIC Potted!\nIC - 6 Harrington - 6\nThis visiting team, might well\nhave been forgiven for forgetting\nthat they were playing away.\nAlong with last year's president,\nAndy Gannaway and the ' A' team captain from last year,\nAndy Hurford, the visit of\nHarrington also saw the return of\nChris Jennings and John White,\nboth former presidents of IC\nSnooker club.\nAs to the game itself IC can\nfeel disappointed with having to\nsettle for a sharing of the points.\nAlthough the Imperial team\nstarted well and led for most of\nthe game they were unable to\nclinch the frame needed to win\nthe match and the visitors,\nobviously anxious not to lose on\nreturning to their old club took\nadvantage as IC began to fade to\ncapture half of the 12 frames in\nthe first home game of the\nseason for Imperial.\nIC \u2014 3 Tate &Lyle \u2014 9 16.10.84\nEvery now and again there is a match in which most of the\nmembers of the team manage to\nplay badly at the same time.\nAgainst Tate & Lyle such a coincidence of events occurred.\nIC never really got into the game\nand frames slipped away leaving\nus on the receiving end of a thrashing.\nUAU v Sussex (away)\nImperial Sussex\nRugby\nFirst 30 8\nSecond 15 6\nSoccer\nFirst 2 3\nSeconds 2 5\nThirds 0 0\nHockey\nMens 0 0\nLadies 0 2\nNetball\nFirst s....1730 Squash\nMen Firsts 2 3\nBadminton\nMen Firsts 4 5\nSeconds 5 4\nLadies Firsts 7 2\nCROSS-COUNTRY RUGBY\nRelay\nSuccess\nTrack & Field News\nLast Sunday, the new Track and\nField Section of the >-i ub turned\nout in force (4 men shame on you\ngirls!), to the Inter-Collegiate\nRelays at Motspar Park, Surrey,\nwhere we competed in the\n4x100m,4 x400m relays\nIn the 4x100m there were two\nheats. In the first heat IC\nannihilated the opposition and\nwere promptly disqualified for\nchanging baton outside the\nchangeover box.\nImperial went some way to\nmaking it up 10 minutes later by\nwinning the 4x400 in relay.\nORIENTEERING\nLost in\nHolmbush\n'Holmbush Revisited'.\nOn Sunday the O Club arrived at\nHolmbush in an assortment of\nvehicles (none of them an IC\nminibus \u2014 thanks, Eric) for a score event.\nThe IC men (and four ladies!)\ncompeted with varying degrees\nof success. A few finished well-up, despite falling in pits/getting\nlost at the first control/running\nright past the finish.

However,\nthere is a gloomy picture behind\nthe figures. It was em baras sing to\nturn out two incomplete teams\nand IC can only keep a polo gi sing to Andy McAleer who made the\njourney only to find he didn't have a partner.

'We all\nhad a jolly good laugh about it, I can tell you!', said Mr Mooney.\nSenor Pedro Gomez, Chief Chef\nand Bottle Washer said to\nFELIX 'Don't ask me, I only\nheat it up'.\n'Par que no al quil an un\nco ci nero en lugar di un p indre para han er la com ida?' he\nremarked.\nMr Mooney has announced\np tans to cope with competition\nfrom the highly successful\nUnion-run Refectory.\n'We have put up our prices\nalready,' he boasted, and I am\ntaking steps to lower the quality\nof the food even further,\nalthough I anticipate some\ndifficulties from Pedigree Chum\nour suppliers'.\n'There will be less staff, and\ntills will be kept short of change.\nThere is not a lot more I can do. I want to create so much demand\nfor Union Refectory food that\nthey will be unable to cope with\nit. They will have to close down in\na matter of months'.\nHis new advertising slogan\n'Eat Mooney for diarrhoea and\nscurvy' is expected to hit campus\nnext week.\nAlarming!\nRape alarms will still be given\naway free by the IC Union after a proposal to charge for them was\nheavily defeated at the Council\nmeeting on Monday evening.\nCouncil is the most powerful\nUnion committee and controls\nfinance and the general running\nof the Union.\nDeputy President, Dave Parry\nhad included in his report a recommendation that a charge of\n25p should be made for the\nalarms. IC Union gives away\nbetween one and two hundred\nalarms, which cost \u00a31.27 each, a year. Mr Parry told Council that\nthis was a major drain on the\nWelfare Budget. A25p charge, he\nargued, would allow more alarms\nto be bought and cover some of\nthe administration charges. Mike\nStuart, Welfare Officer, who\nopposed the report said that the\nWelfare Committee only had\nproblems paying for rape alarms\nbecause its budget had been cut.\nHugh Southey, also opposing,\ntold Council that as a responsible\nUnion, ICU should make every\neffort to ensure women carried\nrape alarms.\nUniversity\nChallenge\nContenders\nChosen\nThe following people will go\nthrough to the second round of\nthe eliminations for the IC University Challenge team.\nSimon Errington Min Tech PG NM Sketch Aero III\nPeter Jump Physics III\nD Wells Physics III\nSteve Parr Physics III\nTim Williams MRE PG Dick Langstaff Humanities\nDuncan Swann Chem Eng IL Irani Physics III\nMartin Hall Man Sci\nSB Groom Atm Physics PG Nick Pike Maths III\nThis will be televised by\nSTOIC to create a suitable\natmosphere.\nThanks to all those people who\nentered the first round. Answers\nto the questions used are\navailable in the Union Office.\nEXHIBIT in South Ken\nThe entry ticket, printed before\nyour eyes and issued free for\naccess at a specified time is the\nfirst hint of the enormous\namount of money spent on\nEXHIBITS, the IBM exhibition\nof Information Technology. This\nmobile exhibition is currently\nhoused in a unique transparent\nstructure designed by an Italian\nArchitect and set in the grounds\nof the Natural History Museum.\nBy the end of 1987 if will have\nvisited 20 cities in 14 European\nCountries.\nEXHIBIT is an impressive\ninsight into the future and is\ndivided into three main areas:-'Technology' is a fascinating\ndisplay of what is currently\navailable and how it is made. The\nemphasis is on chips, not the\npotato variety, showing their\nproduction, testing and use in\ncomputer. Other advances\ninclude demonstrations of\nholographic scanner which can\nread bar-codes in supermarket\ncheckouts, a three dimensional\ndisplay of the EXHIBIT building, the Videotex link to\ndata banks and and two new IBM PC plus personal computers with\nvery high resolution graphics.\n' Computer Games' is, provided there are only a few\nchildren around, an excellent\nchance to try out many different\nkinds of soft wear. As well as a few games there are opportunities to write a comic strip\nscenario, paint, draw with a light\npen, spot counterfeit coins with\nthe aid of a robot and use a touch\nsensitive screen to find your way\naround New York (a strange\nchoice on a European tour\u2014still\nit is only a demonstration).\n'Researching into the future' is\na small but interesting part of the\nexhibition. There are displays of\ncurrent work such as voice\nrecognition and applications of\ncomputers to other disciplines\nfor research purposes. A project\nfrom France is teaching deaf-mute children to talk by adopting\nsound waves into contours\nwhich appear on the screen and\ncan be copied. There is also a film\nabout Scanning Tunnelling\nMicroscopy (STM) a technique\ndeveloped by IBM, of course,\nwhich can produce an image of a solid in three dimensions with\nresolution down to 0.01\nnano metre \u2014 the size of an atom.\nDespite the temptation,\namong all these computers to\nhave computerised explanations,\nthe exhibition is full of very\nhuman people to answer any and\nevery question you may have. It\nis a well planned display and is\njust like stepping into the future\n(for a biochemist, anyway).\nEXHIBIT will appeal to anyone\nwho wants to know what the\nfuture will bring and is highly\nrecommended.\nEXHIBIT is open daily\nMonday to Saturday from 10am6 pm and Sunday 2.30-6.00pm until 2nd December. Admission\nis free.\nIBM are offering a special\npreview of the Exhibition with a buffet to IC students and staff on\nWednesday 7th November from\n6.45pm8.45 pm. Tickets on a first-come first-serve basis are\navailable now from the Public\nRelations Office, Sherfield.\nFELIX Friday 26 October 1984\n\n"

    "content": "ECAREERS\nEmployers' Recruitment\nBrochures\nEvery day at this time of the year, a large bag\nof post arrives in the Careers Advisory\nService containing recruitment brochures\nfrom employers. These range from the\nglossy to the plain, from the informative to\nthe baffling.\nThe best ones include details of what new\ngraduates actually do within various job\nfunctions. This kind of information comes in\ndifferent packaging; some as 'A day in the life\nof Bill Brown' or 'Lizzy Locket's career so far'\nor just as a job description. You can be sure\nthat Bill Brown and Lizzy Locket are not the\nworst graduates they ever employed and\nTraining\nfor\nEngineers\nEmployers have many differing ideas about\ntraining and this is particularly noticeable in\nthe engineering industry. Mechanical and\nCivil Engineers are usually given a much,\nmore formal and structured training than\nthose of other disciplines. Some firms\nimpose their training programme upon you\nana ,.n others you have to keep asking if you\nwant to receive more training. Training\nleading to the status of Chartered Engineer\nusually includes induction workshop\npractice, the application of knowledge and\ntechniques to processes, design, business\npractice and 'objective training'. Induction\noften takes the form of a short course to tell\nrecruits about the structure of the company,\nits products, lines of communication and the\ngeneral philosophy of the management.\nMany Imperial College graduates will have\nalready experienced workshop practice but\nphysicists, for example, entering the\nelectronics industry may well be sent on a course at a local college to understand the\ntools and techniques used in industry.\nThe next stage of training tends to be the\napplication of techniques to processes. This\nnaturally takes on different forms depending\non the industry concerned but requires some\ninvolvement with the production side of the\nbusiness.\nSome experience of design is considered\nto be of critical importance these days and\nincludes an understanding of safety\nconsiderations, cost of buying in\ncomponents or their manufacture.\nBusiness practice is an introduction to\ncommerce and finance and often includes a period of time spent in the marketing\ndepartment.\n8\ntheir rate of progress might be difficult to\nmatch.\nAt least these brochures should give you a flavour of what graduates doing specific\nwork in the organisation are about.\nDetails of the firm's training schemes are\nusually prominent in graduate recruitment\nbrochures. Just as with brochures for exotic\nholidays, the discerning reader can learn as\nmuch from the omissions as from the\ncontent. If training is not mentioned there is\nunlikely to be any provided. Other important\ninformation to be found in these publications\nincludes details of the business, the products\n'Directed objective training' usually takes\nabout six months and is on the job training,\ndesigned to prepare engineers for their first\nresponsible job. Many sponsored students\nwill have completed all but their objective\ntraining before they leave college.\nAfter that those wishing to become\nChartered Engineers must reach the ripe old\nage of twenty-five and spend two years in a responsible job. Anyone without the\nnecessary academic qualifications to\nbecome a member of one of the Chartered\nEngineering Institutions may take a little\nlonger. Increasingly institutions are insisting\non a written report of the training received\nand a professional interview.\nResearch or\nCommerce?\nAsk many 35 year olds how they got to be\ndoing what they're doing now and the\nanswers will probably include something like\n\u2014 'I saw this advert, I met this chap, I knew I did't want to work in 'x', so 'y' was all that was\nleft; I got bored with 'a' so I kind of drifted in\nto 'b'; the interviewer was so gorgeous...'\nAll rather random and erratic with\napparently no long term plan. It's true that\nthey probably didn't consciously apply any\nmethod but sub-consciously parts of the\ncareer choice process have been happening.\nThere are five steps in the process \u2014\norientation, self-awareness, market\nawareness, matching and self-marketing.\nYou may not even be at stage one yet or you\nmay already be at stage five. Often success at\nstage five is dependent on how well you have\ndone the other steps.\nOrientation is just finding out what\n'career choice' is all about, how you go about\ndeciding, who and what there is to help you\nand what stage in the process you have\nreached. In reading this article you have\nFriday 26 October 1984\nthe company makes, and the locations of its\nfactories and offices. Job vacancies for the\nforthcoming recruitment round are\nsometimes included with an indication of\nwhich degree disciplines they will consider\nfor each vacancy. It is interesting that one\nthird of the vacancies are for students with a degree in any subject.\nIf you intend to make a serious application\nto a company for employment, it is almost\nessential to read their recruitment brochure.\nSome companies, for example IBM and Peat\nMarwick, are outraged if you have not. There\nare always reference files available in the\nCareers Library if all the other copies have\ngone. Some employers have the habit of\nproducing their literature very late and many\nstudents come to read these brochures on\nthe day when the company is visiting the\nCollege. That is bound to be the day when\nthe supply runs out.\nbegun to orientate yourself!\nSelf-awareness. Before you can decide\nwhat is the best course of action, you need to\nknow, for example, what you have to offer,\nwhat you want out of life, what sorts of things\nyou would like to do in a job. This is one of the\nhardest stages in the process of choosing a career and often one which people skip, find\ntoo difficult or believe they have already\ndone. At the end of this stage, you should\nhave a list which describes you and all the\nthings that you would like in a job or a course\nand all the things that you would hate.\nMarketing awareness. Now you need to\nlook at the choices. Analyse the\nalternatives\u2014jobs, courses, year off. Break\nthem down into their components. For\nexample, what skills are required? What\ncharacter traits are most suitable? Where\nwill it lead?\nMatching. Now you look for the closest fit\nbetween your list about yourself and the\ncharacteristics of the jobs. Bear in mind,\nhowever, that the re will always be something\nwrong with a job \u2014 the perfect job is a rarity\nwhich we all seek!\nSelf-marketing. Apply and be\ninterviewed. These are discussed elsewhere\nin FELIX.\nAt all stages, you should 'test for reality'.\nYou might believe that you're a good leader,\nbut have you any evidence? Have you ever\nbeen in a situation where you have had to\nlead? If not, why not and what does it tell you\nabout yourself? You want to work in the\nNorth West of England but the job that you\nwant to do is only available in the South East.\nWhich is most important to you, the job or\nthe place?\nFinally a word about environment \u2014 you\ncan research your choice of career and\narrive at the perfect job for you but if you\nthen find that you don't like the people that\nyou work with or the place of work is\ndepressing, you will still be unhappy. So do\ntry and see where you'll be working and meet\nthe people you'll be working with, before\nmaking your final choice. Oh, yes, and don't forget your jolly old careers service, here to\nhelp you at every stage.\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CAREERSH\nGo get a dog and\nroger it\nThe Careers Directories are best summed\nup by the phrase GOGETa DOG and\nRO GET. To give them their full titles, they\nare called Graduate Opportunities (big and\nthick), Graduate Employment and Training\n(compact), Directory of Opportunities for\nGraduates (small but informative) and\nRegister of Graduate Employment and\nTraining (the Careers Advisers' version). All\ncontain details of a large number of\nemployers. GET tops the list with addresses\nof over 2000 companies. Since they all\ninclude a slightly different group of\nemployers you may have to ferret around to\nfind the one with details of your favourite\ncompany. Most of them have an index which\ncan be understood in under five minutes so\nthat you can find a list of employers of\nChemical Engineers or whatever is your\nbent. Some have geographical breakdown\ngiving details of employers in various parts of\nthe country but these are not as good as the\nlocal lists of graduate recruiters in the\nCareers Library.\nRO GET contains a very useful set of job\ndescriptions; useful because they give you\ndetails of the activities which various areas of\nwork include. Ask yourself 'Can I really\nimagine myself doing that particular kind of\nwork?' You may sometimes be surprised by\nyour reactions.\nAll the directories contain editorial\nmaterial on various topics including career\nchoice, the search for a suitable employer,\ndeveloping areas of employment, how to\napply for a job and the selection process.\nThere are however, a range of 70 Careers\nInformation Booklets freely available in the\nCareers Library on almost every career you\ncan think of from Actuary to Zoologist.\nDOG is different from the others because\nit comes in four different species and\ncontains much more editorial material. DOG1 is about careers in finance; DOG2 about\ncareers related to science, engineering and\ncomputing; DOG3 deals with business\ncareers including marketing and DOG4 is\nabout postgraduate courses and the pros\nand cons of studying for a further degree.\n( DOG3 and 4 should be available in\nNovember). Supplies of these free handouts\nare somewhat restricted but you should be\nable to select at least one copy for your own\nreference. Please be prepared to share or\nexchange with other final year students.'\nApplications\na Job'\nWhy do you wish to work for Roly Poly\nFoods?\n( Think!... I don't know... DoI?) Pause...(Thinks...again Ah yes!)\nAs a Mechanical Engineer with an interest\nin a career in Production Engineering, I have\nalways been fascinated by production\nprocesses not least in the food industry. A recent course on flexible manufacturing\nsystems has increased my interest in\nautomation techniques and process control,\netc...\nAt Roly Poly Foods the range of products\nyou produce must require a wide variety of\nmanufacturing techniques... reading your\ngraduate recruitment brochure, I am\nattracted by the training you provide and the\nwork in which your recent graduates are\ninvolved. It seems an environment in which I could soon make a contribution.\nWell something like that would perhaps\nmake a reasonable answer to a difficult\nquestion of this kind. Here are a few tips\nabout application forms.\nFirst of all read the form through before\nyou start. Use black ink so that it can be\nphotocopied. Be sure that your replies are\n'Gius\nlegible and without spelling mistakes. Avoid\nthree word replies. Don't tell the employer\nwhat they can do for you but rather what\ncontribution you can make. Pay attention to\nthe layout of your words in the space\nprovided. Try to be positive about your\nsuccesses.\nThese are the basic requirements. Try also\nto be original and avoid giving the same\nanswer as your friend. It is part icu a rly important to avoid hackneyed phrases like 'I want to work with people'. One final tip \u2014\ndon't assume that employers are only\ninterested in your studies. If you can write\nabout spare time activities which provide\nevidence of team work, leadership, initiative\non your part, commercial flair or practical,\nliterary, verbal or numerical skills, all the\nbetter. Last of all, if you are about to get a PhD for studying Saturn's rings or some\nother subject not frequently heard of in the\nindustrial world, don't put yourself forward\nas someone who knows a great deal about\nnext to nothing. It is the skills you have\ndeveloped which are important \u2014 analysis,\nlogic, problem solving, report writing and so\non \u2014 not necessarily the subject itself.\nCAREERS\nFELIX\n\u2022Careers Directories\npage 7\n\u2022Application Forms\npage 7\n\u2022Employers' Brochures\npage 8\n\u2022Training schemes\npage 8\n\u2022Research or Commerce?\npage 8\n\u2022List of companies\nattending Careers Fair\npage 10\n\u2022Careers advisers\u2014What\ndo they do?\npage 13\n\u2022Interviews\u2014How to\nsucceed\npage 13\n\u2022Case Study\npage 13\nINDUSTRIALl\nSOCIETY\nCAREERS\nFAIR 1984\nFeatui\n\u00ab\u00abng over 60 companies\nWednesday 31 October\n10.30am to 4.00pm Great Hall and\nJun'[or Common n FELIX Friday 26 October 1984\n\n"
