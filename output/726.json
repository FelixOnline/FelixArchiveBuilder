    "content": "BOOK I can't imagine the boring,\nstoop-shouldered,\ndandruff-ridden Imperial\nlecturers even thinking\nabout something as\ninteresting as central\nheating. Hence it comes as\na bit of a shock to read a book where some academics think about\nsuch youthful activities as\nsex, and put thought into\naction.\nTwo professors, one English and the other\nAmerican, swop jobs for six\nmonths, and have all sorts\nof merry capers. Z app, the\nwise d up American, comes over with a plane load of\npregnant women on their\nway to an abortion clinic\nand ends up being attacked\nby a former head of\ndepartment who's escaped from a local lunatic asylum. Philip, the quiet retiring\nEnglishman, gets arrested\nfor stealing bricks and has\na Black Panther in his\noffice. Add to this a Lotus\nsports car, student\nactivism, a drug crazed\norgy and a radical phone-in\nradio programme and the\ningredients are mixed for a feast of hilarity.\nIt may sound a bit\nincestuous for a Professor\nof modern English\nLiterature to write a book\nabout another two\nprofessors of English\nLiterature, but the\ntechnique pays off to give a brilliant book, which is one\nof the few I'd ever have\ntreated myself to.

Puig's characters demonstrate the\nfutility of male aggression with enchantment, and\nMolina's violent death is as\nmuch an uncomfortable\nplot shape r as it is a betrayal of the sincerity of\nthe film.

This means\nthat today's protest must be\nfollowed by strikes, lobbies\nand sit ins. The government\nmust be made to see that it\nneeds to invest in\neducation. IC Union, traditionally an apathetic\nunion, needs to be part of\nthese protests. If IC\nstudents protest the\ngovernment may take\nnotice.

The reasons for\nthe revised bills are two-fold:\n(a) Head Tenancy flats\nare rented on a38 week\nbasis and the bills for the\nyear are usually divided\ninto Autumn Term and\nChristmas Vacation, Easter\nTerm and Easter Vacation\nand Autumn Term gas and\nelectricity, and Summer Term and Easter gas and\nelectricity.\nAt the beginning of term\nI made the mistake of\nallocating Hamlet Gardens on an 11 week basis, ie to\nthe end of the Autumn| Term. Thus at a later date\n| (end of November) Ii am mended the Autumn Term bills to include the\n| Christmas Vacation.\n(b) Some flats contain\nsingle rooms. Hamlet\nGardens is allocated in two\nblocks (Flats 9-140 and\nFlats 201-220). At the\nbeginning of term (when\nallocating rooms) I was\nonly aware of 4 of these.\nDuring the first couple of\nweeks some people came\nin and told me they were in\nsingles and I altered their\nbills. During the term\nvarious attempts were\nmade to discover who else\nhad single rooms. Thus when December came along I felt that these bills\nneeded sorting out before\nthe end of term. Thus I selected people at random\nand sent them new bills\nalong with the covering\nletter.\nWhen your groups signed\nup for the flat you entered\ninto a contract to pay a certain amount of rent per\nweek. When the flat\noccupants received their\nbills it would have been\nobvious to make sure that\nthe weekly bill was correct.\nAlso, the people in double\nrooms surely would have\nraised questions as to why\nthey were paying the same as those in single rooms.\nI apologise for the\nseeming lack of\ncommunication and\napparent interest from\nmyself (charges which I heartily deny) and the\ntrouble which has been\ncaused by the re-issuing of\nbills. Steps have now been\ntaken to improve the\nchecking of dates of stay\nand rents charged.\nYours sincerely.\nDave Parry\nStudent Services Finance\nAssistant\n2 Friday 17 January FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Photosoc Competition\nMaybe it's because there\nwasn't enough publicity\nthat the response to our\nmagnificent photos oc FELIX Competition was so\nbad. Don't laugh, but we\nonly got three entries.\nPathetic isn't It? But not to\nworry! If you are an\nundiscovered photographic\ngenius (and I know there\nare hundreds of you out\nthere) then all is not lost,\nbecause we are going to\nhave ANOTHER COMPETITION, this time\nwith a small PRIZE. All you\nneed to do is submit a portfolio of up to four black\nand white or colour prints\n(not slides) to the FELIX office before the end of\nterm. The pictures can be\nof any subject whatsoever\nand any size.\nMeanwhile here are the\nresults of our very small\nChristmas competition.\nFirst: Ping Chuang, second:\nHugh Rubin and third:\nJulian Shulman. Mr\nShulman submitted a very\ninteresting portfolio\nconsisting of some views of\na suburban housing estate,\na rainbow, a cat walking on\na garden fence and a small\ndog in an armchair. Hugh Rubin's portfolio was\nextremely good. It\nconsisted of a series of\nB& W prints of superb\nquality and excellently\ncomposed. Four of these\nwere particularly\nimpressive. It is unfortunate\nthat you cannot see them,\nbecause they really are\nvery good. It seems to be\nthe (almost) unanimous opinion of the FELIX staff,\nhowever that Ping\nChuang' s portfolio was the\nbest, although personally I prefer Mr Rubin's pictures.\nThe photograph\nreproduced here is actually\nabout 12 inches by 16\ninches and mounted in\nglass. It is a monochrome print which has been hand\ncoloured, and it must be\nsaid that the FELIX printing\ndoes not do full justice to\nit. So if you are wondering\nwhy this particular picture\nwas chosen, you must bear\nin mind that it looks much more impressive in real life.\nWell, that's all folks!\nRemember that we want\nlots and lots and lots of\nentries for the new\ncompetition, so get your\nshutter fingers working\nover-time and let's see what\nyou can do.\nHoward Rudd\nThere is not much sport this\nweek due to bad weather and\nall matches on Saturday and\nWednesday at Harlington\nbeing cancelled due to\nwaterlogged pitches. However, the Evelyn Gardens football championships was decided.\nBernard Sunley House maintained their 100%\nrecord to win the Evelyn\nGardens Houses Championship. The traditional crunch match\nbetween the two all-male\nhouses in Evelyn Gardens, Bernard Sunley and\nHolbein, settled the 85/86\nchampionship After a fairly even first\nten minutes Bernard Sun ley tripped up when Scott\nGordon picked up the ball\nin the box and slipped it\nunder the keeper to go one\nup. Almost immediately\nfrom the restart a long ball\nfrom just inside the half\nwas misjudged by the B SH keeper and bounced over\nhis head and into the back\nof the net.\nAfter another ten minutes\nB SH winger Byron Wood picked up the ball, passed\na couple of backs and\nsquared it to a waiting\nSteve James who calmly\nplaced the ball out of the\nkeeper's reach 2-1.\nWith Bernard Sun ley now\ndominating the game the\nnext goal was a surprisingly long time\ncoming, but once again\nSteve James managed to\nout-fox the keeper and find\nthe net.\nAbout five minutes before\nhalf-time Byron Wood broke through on the right\nwing and planted one in\nthe top left of the net. B SH then had to absorb some pressure with Rob James,\nLaurence Covill and Andy Watson making a solid\nbarrier, with help from a still drunk Marcus Shepherd.\nImmediately after halftime Steve Wilkinson\npicked the ball up at the\ntop of the box and blasted\none past the keeper to find\nthe goal.\nByron Wood got the fifth\ntaking it round the keeper\non the edge of the box,\nthen beating two defenders\nstanding on the line.\nWith Andy Watson\nj in king and jiving on the\nright and Rob James stopping anyone and\nanything on the left B SH were coping well at the\nback. Laurence( Fog-horn)\nCovill took all the high\nballs and could have\nswallowed the ball if he had\nopened his mouth a little\nwider.\nByron Wood completed\nhis hat-trick to make B SH62 up. Holbein then put\nthe Bernard Sun ley goal\nunder pressure with some good runs by Andy Keelin\nand Scott Gordon. The B SH keeper redeemed\nhimself in part with a couple of saves and some rapid hoofing by Malcolm Jones, Lai Covill and\nMarcus Shepherd, who was\nsobering up by now but\nwas not keen on heading,\nsaw B SH through to the\nfinal whistle.\nSailing Last Saturday the Imperial\nCollege Sailing team set off\nfor the first match of the\nterm against Bristol\nUniversity.\nThe first race sailed\nlooked as if it was going to\nbe a very close finish, with\nsome very good sailing\ncoming from both teams,\nuntil the last lap when two\nmembers of the opposition\ndecided to show us the\nbest way to sink a firefly.\nFortunately the boat was\ndragged to the shore and\nemptied before it sank\ncompletely.\nAfter lunch the\nresumption of racing was\ndelayed due to a squall\npassing over, during which various members of both\nteams set about\ndemonstrating their\ncapsizing skills. Not\nsatisfied with this someone tried sailing away from the\njetty leaving half a tiller\nextension behind and\nalmost collided with other\nboats tied up there.\nBy the end of the squall\nthere were 4 boats, 6 helms\nand 5 crews still ready to\nsail. Racing was then\nresumed, involving some very competitive sailing\nwith all previous ducking s forgotten.\n12 Friday 17 January FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Fowler Foul-Up\nA report in last\nWednesday's GUARDIAN reveals that a Government 'cover up' has resulted in\nthousands of misinformed\nstudents claiming benefits\nto which they were not\nentitled.\nThe mistake occurred when Social Services\nSecretary Mr Norman Fowler released premature\ninformation to the press on half of the Department of\nHealth and Social Security,\nannouncing changes which would have allowed\nstudents under covenant to\nclaim supplementary\nbenefit during the summer vacation. In fact, these new\nregulations were withdrawn\nin late November, a few\ndays before they were due to be passed by parliament.\nMr Fowler chose not to\nissue another statement ..\nannouncing the\npostponement, informing\nonly his staff of the change, via an internal circular. This in effect, misled Students\ninto believing that they\ncould receive this benefit\non top of their parents'\ncon ven ant payments.\nWhen questioned by\nFELIX, a Senior DHS S Official denied the\nGUARDIAN'S allegation\nthat the withdrawal came about because of drafting\nerrors of the type that led\nto last year's 'Board and lodgings' court case, in\nwhich another set of DHS S regulations were deemed illegal by the Commons Statutory Instruments\nCommittee. Although these\nlatest rules still await\nconfirmation to become part of the benefit changes reported in last week's issue, the official assured\nFELIX that all students who mistakenly claimed have\nactually been reimbursed\nby special payment. He could, however, find 'no\napparent reason' for Mr Fowler's action.\nBar Staff\nA proposal which aims to\nencourage tie club members to work in the\nUnion bar on weekdays was given unanimous support at Mondays Internal Services\nCommittee. Those present\nat the meeting included\nCarl Burgess, Dave\nKingston, Quentin Fontana,\nand Moore Lyttle the Union Bar Manager. Quentin\nFontana hopes that the tie\nclubs will take to drinking\nin the bar as a result of the\nmove. He denied the\nsuggestion that ordinary\nstudents wishing to work in\nthe bar would be placed at\na disadvantage.\nPete Wilson IC Union Welfare Officer is worried\nthat there would be fewer\nbar sessions available for\n'ordinary students', and is\nalso concerned that the bar\nwill become inevitably tie\nclub orientated.'\nNUS Slam\nDHSS Cuts\nStudents will lose up to\n\u00a31100 through being\nunable to claim\nsupplementary and housing\nbenefit over the summer holidays, claims NUS vice\npresident Vicki Phillips.\nOne result of this is that\nmany students may have tc\ngive up their courses.\nThe Government explanation for the cuts is\nthe high administration\ncosts of running the\nbenefits. According to the\nGovernment for\nsupplementary benefits of\n\u00a34 million, administration\ncost were \u00a32 million, and for housing benefits of \u00a35\nmillion, \u00a33 million were\nspent on administration.\nTheN US vice President is\nencouraging students to\nwrite letters of protest to\nMPs. Friday 24th January has\nbeen designated a local\nday of protest organised by\nthe NUS, which also plans\na mass lobby of MPs on February 12th. \u2022 2 4 th January, 12.30pm Me chEng foyer JC Union leaflet protest at Harrods\nBe there or be square!\nGoing Through The Motions\nThe AUT Strike, academic affairs and Nicaraguan coffee were discussed at a lively Union General\nMeeting ( UG M)on Tuesday. The venue was,\nunusually, Ci vEng201 after it was discovered on\nMonday that the Great Hall\nhad not been booked. The meeting voted\noverwhelmingly to support\nthe AUT strike and requested students not to\nattend lectures on Wednesday morning. Full\ndetails appeared in a special strike issue of\nFELIX on Wednesday. Earlier in the meeting,\nPresident Carl Burgess was repeatedly questioned\nabout the proposed move\nof the FELIX Office to the\nkitchen behind the Lounge. He made it clear that he\nwas sympathetic to the\nlatest in a long line of John Smith im spire d schemes to\ntake over Union Controlled\nareas.\nSeveral changes to the\nUnion ByLaws were\napproved. Three related to\nthe creation of a post of\nWomen's Officer and setting up a Bar Committee to oversee the managing of\nthe newly Union-controlled\nBar.\nFollowing the AUT Debate the second part of\nTaylor's academic affairs\nmotion was passed. This\nmeans that the Union has\ncomprehensive polices on\nthe issue that affect it's members everyday life.\nThe meeting then moved\non to discuss whether the\nUnion Snack Bar should\nserve Nicaraguan coffee.\nProposer Pete Hob b is said\nthat the money raised by\nthe sale of the coffee would go to help pay for\neducation, which was badly\naffected by the civil war\nand the US embargo on\ntrade. The coffee was only\na little more expensive than\nthat the Snack Bar currently used, amounting\nto only one penny per cup. Deputy President Dave\nKingston opposed the\nmotion, saying that\ndecisions affecting the\nmanagement of Union Trading activities should\nnot be made by UG Ms, even if the intention was to\nsupport a good cause. The motion was then amended to from a request to sell the\ncoffee, but Mr Kingston\nwas still opposed to it.\nHowever, on the vote the\nmotion received a substantial majority.\nCops And\nRobbers\nIn an operation involving\nhalf a dozen vehicles at\n1.30 on Wednesday afternoon local police and units from the Diplomatic\nProtection Branch( D PBS) gave chase to two burglary\nsuspects driving a builders\nvan. The suspects were\nalso pursued by a member\nof the public in a BMW316 who had interrupted their\nattempt to commit a burglary in Paddington. The BMW paused on\nPrince Consort Road to\ntake on board a police man before resuming chase.\nThe Diplomatic\nProtection Branch became involved when D PB officer\nPolice Constable Fuller, on\nduty outside the Iraqi\nembassy, sighted the\nburglar's van speeding\ndown Queen's Gate on the\nwrong side of the road.\nThe chase ended when\nthe men abandoned their\nvehicle in Palace Gate.\nDuring the chase the\nDiplomatic Protection\nBranch and local police\ndiscovered that their radio\nequipment would not let\nthem communicate directly\nand were forced to relay all\nmessages via two\npolicemen standing in the\nstreet, one equipped with aDP B issue radio and another with the normal\nvariety.\nQT Stunt\nFour students yesterday\nwent into the Union Snack bar and ate a slap-up meal\nat a candlelit table served\nby a waiter. The diners,\nbelieved to be members of\nQT, commented on the\nhigh quality of service\n'Chez Norman'.

This technique\nhas many advantages over\nmore conventional methods\nof crop growth, in\nparticular, as crop yields\ncan be increased by as\nmuch as tenfold, more\nefficient use of glasshouse s is possible. It also allows\nfor better control ?f plant\ngrowth, less trouble from\npests, and a quicker turn\nround between crops.\nHowever, it is important\nthat pH is controlled, that\nthe nutrient solution is\nreplenished with iron,\npotassium, and nitrate ions\nas they are used up by the\nplants, and that the build\nup of undesirable ions such as chloride and sodium is\nmonitored the design of the\nautomatic nutrient film\nanalyse r is based on ion\nselective electrodes. These use a carrier, impregnated\nin a membrane, to bind the\ntarget ion in the right sized\ncavity and transport it\nacross the membrane. For\nexample, in the case of\npotassium ions a naturally\noccur ing compound vali no my c in is used. The potential which is\nestablished across the\nmembrane provides a direct\nmeasure of the\nconcentration. In the new\nsystem a microcomputer is\nused to calibrate the\nelectrodes, control the\nsensors, sample the\nnutrient, and analyse the\ndata. An important aspect\nof the system is that it can be used and maintained by\nnon-specialised staff. At\npresent it is in use at the\nNational Institute of\nAgricultural Engineering\nand has successfully\nmonitored tomato crops\nthroughout two growing seasons.\nAn electrochemical\nsensor designed to\nmeasure expired carbon\ndioxide has been developed\nby Professor Albery,\nHumphrey Drummond, and\nBill Young in colla b ration with Dr Han of the\nRadcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. This sensor was produced to monitor patients in\nintensive care, and for use\n; in the operating theatre It\nmakes use of a teflon\n; membrane, which allows\noxygen and carbon dioxide\nto pass through, to\nseparate the expired air\nfrom the thin layer of\n; solution in which the\nelectrochemistry takes\nplace. Because carbon dioxide is electro chemically stable to even large\nvoltages (2-3v), the action\nof the sensor depends on\nreduction of oxygen to\ngenerate the highly reactive\nsuperoxide ion, which then\nreacts with the carbon\ndioxide. The concentration\nof carbon dioxide is then\ncalculated from the\ndifference between the\namount of superoxide\ngenerated and the amount\nrecovered. This can all be\nachieved so rapidly that it\nis possible to display a breath by breath analysis of\nexpired carbon dioxide.\nBy coupling enzymes with electrodes a very\nsophisticated and selective\nrecognition can be\nachieved. Professor Albery\nand Dr Cass are working\non a number of important\nnew bio sensors which take\nadvantage of the catalytic\nactivity and specificity of\nenzymes.\nAn important\nbreakthrough has been the\nthe development of a bio sensor to detect alcohol.\nThe sensor, which has\nThe result is a sensor\nwhere the current is\ndirectly proportional to the\nconcentration of the\nal colo l. There is also a glucose bio sensor, which has been\ndeveloped by Professor\nAlbery, Dr Cass and Derek\nCraston, that is of similar\ndesign to the alcohol\nsensor. However, it is\nbased on the\noxidation/reduction of\nF ADH/ FAD. Recent tests of\nthis sensor, carried out by\nDr Fillenz at Oxford, have\nshown that it can be used\nto measure blood glucose levels in vivo. So it should\nprove extremely valuable in\ntreatment of diabetes, as\nwell as for fermentation\ncontrol, and tests on meat\nfreshness.\nThe 'electrochemical\ncanary', which is a bio sensor designed to\ndetect toxic gases such as\nhydrogen sulphide and\nhydrogen cyanide, is\nanother project that Dr\nCass and Professor Albery\nare collaborating on, along\nwith S Shiu. This sensor\nbeen developed by\nProfessor Albery, Dr Cass and K Sim, should find\napplication in process\ncontrol of fermentation, for\ncustoms and excise to test\nalcohol content of spirits,\nand in the production of a more eff i cent breath aly ser for police use. But its major\nimportance lies in the fact\nthat this action is based on\nthe oxidation of NADH to\nNAD as there are over 250\nenzymes that use the\ncofactor NAD/ NADH. This opens up the pos sib lit y of\nconstructing enzymes electrodes of this type with\na wide range of\napplications.\nThe alcohol bio sensor takes advantage of the\ncatalytic activity of the\nenzyme. A piece of dialysis\nmembrane, which allows\nthe substrate (in this case\nalcohol) to pass through, is\nused to trap the enzyme in\na solution layer next to the\nelectrode. The enzyme then\nacts as a catalyst for the\nreaction between NAD and\nthe substrate, producing NADH. The electrode is made of\na strongly conducting organic salt specially\nchosen by the term, which absorbs the en yz me on its\nsurface, but more\nimportantly facilitates the\noxidation of NADH to NAD. should prove to be\nextremely valuable for use\non oil rigs, as well as for\ngeneral environmental\nmonitoring. At low\nconcentration levels\nhydrogen sulphide gas is\neasily detectable because\nof its pungent odour, but at\nhigher levels it cannot be\ndetected by smell. This is\nparticularly a problem for\nthe oil industry, as oil often\ncontains pockets of other\ngases, and in the past\naccidents have led to\ndeaths from hydrogen\nsulphide poisoning. The enzyme at present used in\nthe sensors comes from\nbeef heart, and is the one\nthat is actually affected if\nthe toxic gases enter the\nbody. However, the sensor\nmight be required to\nremain inactive for long\nperiods of time before it is\nneeded, and the long term\nstability of this particular\nenzyme is proving to be a problem. So the team are\nlooking for other more\nstable naturally occurring\nenzymes, or at the\npossibility of genetic\nmanipulation.\nDr Cass' s group have\nalso developed a paracetamol bio sensor which is in the process of\ngoing into commercial production. This is an\nextremely valuable sensor\nas it can be used by\nhospital staff to rapidly\nassess the extent of an\noverdose, so helping to\nsave lives. At present, the\ngroup are also working on\nsensors to measure the\nextent of water pollution by\ninsecticides.\nElectrochemical sensors\nhave an important role to\nplay in the future of\nscience. But the\ndevelopment of new\nsensors requires\ncollaboration between\nscientists of different\ndisciplines including\nelectrical engineers,\nchemists, biochemists, and bio technologists. So it was\nwith this in mind that the\nScience and Engineering\nResearch Council recently\nlaunched a special initiative\nto support and encourage this type of interdisciplinary\nwork in universities and\npolytechnics. It is hoped\nthat ultimately the\ndevelopment of new\nsensors could lead to the\nestablishment of a new\nhigh technology industry in\nthe United Kingdom. Security Division \u2014 Traffic Wardens Since the College reopened in Jan'86 it\nhas become increasingly obvious that many of the students( especially' Fresher s' are flagrantly disobeying the strict parking rules and regulations laid down by the security office. Should you have a car but no recognised Blue permit( the Kensington or Chelsea Permit does not apply to the College.) you are strictly not allowed to park within the College Campus Should you persist in this selfish action or ignorant attitude your wheels could be clamped.

    "content": "Whenever you criticise the\nsuperheroes who make up\nthe FELIX staff, you should keep in mind that you are\nprivileged to receive free\none of the best student\nmagazines on the market. I now feel able to make this\nclaim as I have had a look\nat some of the so-called\n'competition'.\nQueen Mary College\nStudent Union have an\norgan called Cub. Last term\nthey wasted a third of a page ranting about the loss\nof their wretched mascot\nMary which was stolen by\nImperial's own Royal\nCollege of Science (it\nmakes you proud, doesn't it!). They begged for\ninformation leading to the\nabduction of either the\nR CSU mascot Theta or the\nICU mascot Mike, but since\nTheta and Mike are both\nstill safe and sound, we can\nsee that their campaign has\nbeen marvellously\nun sucessful. Mind you, what can you ex pact from\nQMCII\nYou might think that the\nRoyal College of Art would\nbe able to produce a well\ndesigned, well laid out, and\nartistic publication, even if\non a shoestring budget.\nDodo Express, the new\nRCA SU magazine not only\ndispels the myth that artists\nhave any imagination or\nstyle, but also has the\ndubious distinction of\nmaking Guildsheet look like\nthe Financial Times. The lousy illustrations, boring\nlayout, and infantile\nmaterial suggest to me that\nthe Dodo Express staff\nspend too much time\npainting nude models, and really need to get their\nteeth into a good problem\nsheet. Of course the\nmagazine was printed on\ntrendy recycled paper, and\nI suppose that's what\ncounts!?\nUniversity College is the\nbiggest college in London University. I find it strange\nthen, that Pi is so badly\nproduced. In a feature they\ndid on student magazines,\nthey claimed that they were\nthe only student newspaper\nin London that came out\nevery week \u2014 this, as every\nFELIX reader knows, is an\nuntruth, a lie, and could\nalmost be described as\nlibellous. They also said\nthat they were one of the\nfew student magazines to\nbe produced internally and\nproceeded to use this as an\nexcuse for the fact that PI\nis so unattractive to look at.\nFELIX is internally\nproduced, and it looks\ngood, and our news is up\nto date. In their 'feature', PI\nplayed the dirty trick of\nusing our masthead in their\narticle without actually\nsaying anything about our\npaper, thus tarring us with\nthe same brush as the\nother papers without\ns lagging us off overtly\n(because they know that PI\nwouldn't have a leg to\nstand on if they tried to\nslag us off). To be blunt,\nPI, though it has alot of\ngood points, has a very\nunprofessional look about\nit: the layout is childish and\nslipshod and it's use of the\nEnglish language is not\nimpressive (considering\nthat they have an English\ndepartment). PI has great\npotential, but only if the\nstaff stop being so bloody\ncomplacent!!\nLondon Sudent, the\nnewspaper of the University\nof London Union is the\nonly publication besides\nFELIX which ICU gives out.\nFortunately, I cannot find it\nin my heart to say anything\nnasty about this\nnewspaper. It is too boring\nfor words. What can be\nmore boring, for instance,\nthan having Tony Spencer, ICU's Rag Mag editor, on\nthe front cover! Hopefully,\nLondon Student will\ndisappear into oblivion,\nthus saving the editors the\nem baras s ment of being\nassociated with the least\nread and least interesting\nnewspaper in London. National Student, on the\nother hand, is a great\nlaugh. (It belongs to the\nNational Union of Students\nto which, as you may know,\nwe have refused to pay lots\nof money to join.) While\ntrying to imitate posy\nmagazines like The Face it\nsucceeds only in looking\nlike a poor relative, a mere\nshadow of the real thing. IC\nstudents are actually\nexpected to pay for the\nopportunity to fill in a questionnaire with\nquestions along the lines of\n'what do you think is the\nMost Fab Thing or Person\nin the whole world'. I would\nsuggest that this\npublication be avoided \u2014 if\nyou want to buy a posy\nmagazine buy The Face,\nCosmopolitan, or Avant\nGarde... at least they have\ntheir own style (so I'm told).\nOf all the student papers\nI looked at, the Birmingham\nSun was the most\nfascinating. In three\nsubsequent issues they had\nthree different editors: a racist Bangladeshi; a lefty\nlesbian (she appointed one\nperson for news and\nfeatures together, but two\nwomen's editors); and the\nmysterious Colin Reed who didn't even manage to\nproduce a full issue. Their\nstyles differed as much as\ntheir staff did (you can see\nfrom the credits who was\nwho's friend) and the sheer\nb itchiness which must have\nriddled their office must\nhave been a joy to behold...\nthe knives were certainly\nbeing sharpened at Aston. Anyway, back to IC\ngoings on next week... if\nyou produce the goods. I want lots of backbiting,\nbitching, and general\nnastiness. Please.\nWell, lots of love kids...\nand remember: FELIX is\ntoo good to risk.\nby Felicity the\nCatty\nFELIX\n\n"

The full solution is\ngiven below.\nDoors And Devils\nMost people know the old problem where you're\ntrying to escape from Hell,\nyou come to two doors,\nyou know that one leads to\nfreedom, and that one\nleads to a fiery pit. Outside\nthe doors are two devils,\none who always lies and\none who always tells the\ntruth, but you don't know\nwhich is which. By asking\none question only to one of\nthe devils, you have to find\nthe correct door to go through. The correct\nquestion to ask of either\ndevil is: 'If I asked the other\ndevil which was the correct\ndoor to go through, what\nwould he say?' No matter\nwhich devil you ask, it will\nindicate the wrong door.\nThink about it!\nNow consider a slightly\nharder problem. Firstly\nthere is only one devil who not only might be a truth\nteller or liar, but may\nsometimes lie and\nsometimes tell the truth.\nSecondly there are more\nthan 2 doors, 4 say, and\nonly one leads to escape...\nYou may only ask one\nquestion and the devil can\nindicate one door only.\nAlso the whole question\nmust apply to the devil (ie\nyou cannot ask questions\nof the type 'If you are a liar\nanswer this way, but if you\nare a truth teller answer\nthis way.').\nWhat is the question?\nThe best entry submitted\nby 1:00pm Tuesday28 th will receive a \u00a35 prize.\na distribution of current\nthat is just the addition of\nthe two previous current\ndistributions. (The two\nsolutions are 'super posed'). We've now essentially\nsolved the problem.\nConsider applying a voltage of +1V at any point\non the grid. Because the\ngrid is exactly symmetric\nany current that flows must\nhave the same value in all 4\ndirections (there can be no prefer ed direction) Call this\ncurrent I. ti\n, i The voltage difference is 2V and thus the effective\nresistance is >2 ohm, and\nthat's the answer.\nin Electric nightmare-Solution\nThe pr pb lem, if you\nremember, was to find the\neffective resistance across\none resistor of an infinite,\nsquare, grid of one ohm resistors. The key to the\nproblem is that Ohm's law,\nV= IR, is linear (ie V is\nproportional to I). Thus if VA= UR, and V b=l bR then (V*+ Vb)=(U+ lh)R, obvious,\nhey? Any two solutions can\nbe added together to form\na third solution (this is\nknown as 'linear\nsuperposition' in the\ntechnical lingo, and can be\napp li ad to any linear\nequation). This means that\nfor a fixed resistor\nnetwork, if applying a certain voltage produces a distribution of currents, and applying a different voltage\nat a different place\nproduces a second distribution of currents,\nthen applying both voltages\nat the same time produces\nNow take the adjacent\npoint and consider exactly\nthe opposite situation ie\napply \u2014 1 V and a current of\n-I will flow.\niri These are the two\nsolutions that we' super pose' together. When we do this we get the solution for a2V voltage\ndifference applied across\nthe one resistor.\ntJ 21\nI Jlv\nI4 The currents in the\nresistor add to give 21.\nLooking at the resistor\nalone we have 2V across a one ohm res is it or which\nimplies 1=1 A. Now looking\nat the whole grid, the total\ncurrent flowing into and\nout of the grid is 4I=4 A. Revolution\nLast week we asked you to\nsee how many words you\ncould form from the letters\nof the word 'Revolution'.\nWe used as our definition\nof a valid word anything\nthat appears in the Shorter\nOxford English Dictionary.\nThis produced a plethora o! strange words which we have never heard of but,\nsure enough, were in the\ndictionary. We also had\nseveral people who had\nused computer dictionaries\nto find their words. We are\nglad to say that none of\nthese entries won or even\ncounted in the top few!\nThe entrant with the most\nwords claimed to have\nfound 314. We had to\ndisqualify some o' these as\nthey were not words but\nletters, prefixes, suffixes or\nabbreviations (eg. e,v, IOU,\noo, eo).\nOf the 250 we checked, some were very weird.\nExamples include: vlei \u2014\nSouth. African word for a hollow in which rain\ncollects; levin \u2014 (flash of)\nlightening; hero li \u2014\nessential oil from flowers of\nbitter orange used in\nperfumery.\nCongratulations to Sally\nMcLean \u2014 please come to\ncollect your \u00a35 prize from\nthe FELIX Office after\nMonday lunchtime.\nCongratulations also to\nHugh Stiles for winning \u00a35\nfor the cryptic crossword.

I find it hard to\nunderstand why R SMU has\nto place such importance on this event which has\nbeen so harmful to our\nCollege and our reputation\nas students here, and shows any attempt to\ncriticise Hon Porn is seen as a direct assault on the\nR SMU itself as if it were the\ncentral event in the union's life.\nI also wonder why Mr Pearce wants to flaunt\nbefore the College the fact\nthat they've held Hon Porn night without anyone knowing about it.

Mr Pearce infers that\nmanufacture of bras and\nHon Porn night are 'sexist'\nin the same way, which leads me to believe that he\ntotally misunderstands the\nissues. Manufacture of bras\nis not degrading to men. The event, by its very\nnature, subjugates women, and so to suggest that to\nwatch women as objects,\nmuch like animals in a zoo, is consistent with treating\nwomen as equal human\nbeings is double think of\nthe greatest proportions.\nHowever, most offensive\nof all, I thought, is the way that Mr Pearce raises the\n'moral' question, suggesting, by implications,\nthat people opposed to\nHon Porn night are some sort of self-righteous\npurists, who are against\nthis 'natural act'. Indeed if\nMr Pearce thinks that Hon Porn night has any\nconnection with a natural\nact then I wonder at what\nstage he dropped Biology at school?

    "content": "Rector attacks education policy\nStrike Success\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, speaks to representatives of AUT\nNALGO, ASTMS and ICU.\nWednesday's day of action\nstaged by The Association of ^\nUniversities Teachers (AUT)\nand the National and Local\nGovernment Officers\nAssociation (NALGO) has been\ndescribed by Union officials as\n'very successful'. Nationally,\nfour ty four universities were\naffected and public meetings\nwere held in town centres\nthroughout the country. At\nImperial College many students\nstayed away from lectures in a gesture of support for the strike,\nwhich also had support from IC\nUnion, and the Rector Professor\nEric Ash.\nThe strike's aim, as explained\nin the FELIX strike Special was\nto outline the AUT' s concern over spending cuts, and NAI GO claim for higher wages.\nJanice Lewis, the branch\nsecretary of NAL GO was\n'pleased' with the strike's progress which achieved\n'valuable national publicity'.\nMany students did not cross the\npicket lines and a number of\ndelivery vans were turned away.\nIn the Physics department only\n75 (out of 200) turned up for\nmorning lectures.\nA motion condemning the\ngovernments policy on science funding was lodged by four\nMPs on Tuesday in support of\nthe Save British Science campaign. The campaign, which\nis supported by the Rector Eric\nAsh, and the former Rector\nLord Flowers aims to inform the\npublic and politicians of the\ndamage caused by reduced\nspending on Science. Since it\ninvitation eight weeks ago SBS has attracted 1500 members\nincluding Vice Chancellors, Fellows of the Royal Society\nand eight Nobel Laureates.\nProfessor Ash explained the\neffects cuts were having at\nImperial College. He told FELIX that the cutbacks of 15% by the\nUniversities Grants Council have 'made it difficult for\nImperial College to keep up\nwith competition overseas He also pointed out that the lack of\nmoney available in the UK for\nProfessor Ash, speaking at the\npicket line said that it was\nessential that Britain should have more Science teachers of\na higher calibre. He felt low pay\nlevels in the UK were\nencouraging lecturers to work\nabroad, and that there is a need\nto use the media to change government policy. Keith\nJoseph was, he said, well\nintention ed but ill-informed. Mr\nAsh suggested that a24 hour\nwork-in should be staged, by\nresearch has lead to a 'brain\ndrain', and added that Imperial\nwas experiencing greater\ndifficulty in filling vacant chairs\nand academic posts as a result.\nDuring his visit to the picket\nlines on Wednesday the Rector\nannounced his intention to\ndonate a days wages to SBS. A founding member of the\nSBS campaign Professor Denis\nNoble who held the chair of\nPhysiology at Oxford told FELIX of his concern that 'during the\npast 5 years the gap between\nthe UK' s research spending and\nthat of its competitors has\nin crea sd by 30%'. He went on to\nsay Britain benefits would if\nmore of the money currently\nbeing spent on defence\nresearch was allocated to civil\nresearch and pointed out the\nfindings of the Education Arts\nScience Committee in 1985\nwhich stated that Civil spin offs\nfrom military research were\nstudents. Amongst other things\nthis would comprise early\nmorning discussion groups, a midnight meal, and a lecture\npresented by Mr Ash on the last\nfifty years of University\neducation.\nColin Dixon an AUT Committee member told FELIX that further action was likely in\nthe form of a one or two and a half day regional strike. He went\non to express his thanks to IC\nUnion for lending its support.\ninfrequent. He added 'Britain is\nthe only Western Nation to\nspend more than 50% of its\nresearch funds on defence.'\nShortage of funds at IC have\nalso led to the abandoning of\nimportant research work. The College was unable to gain a \u00a3130,000 grant from the Science and Engineering Research Council for research into a branch of atomic physics which has previously provided the\nbasis for advances in Micro electronic and lasers. The grant\nwas required for specialist\nequipment, including a 'super\nmagnet' for an experiment\ninvolving passing a new type of\nlaser through a cloud of atoms.\nThe work is now to be taken up\nby a German research\nlaboratory.\nPresent forecasts predict that\nby 1990 Japan will have ten\ntimes as many scientists as\nBritian, and that West Germany will have four times the number\nIt is hoped by the SBS campaign that, by bringing the\nproblem into the public light,\nthey can force the Government to take action.\nScience SOS\nFree!

    "content": "Imperial Animals]\nSir,\nI write regarding the\nopinion column on Hon Porn night. While I am\nrelieved by Dave Pearce's assurance that he does not\nmaltreat women, I do not\nthink his arguments stand\nup in any context wider\nthan the RS M Union office,\nfor the following reasons:\u2014\nFirstly, if the audience merely enjoy the thrill of\n'watching something\nsocially taboo', why does\nthat something always have\nto be pornography? There\nare many other social\ntaboos, as I am sure\nmembers of RS M can\ntestify.\nSecondly, although I agree that sex is natural, I do feel that sex between a pig and a( human) woman must be an exception to\nthe rule. This, I am assured\nis part of the\n'entertainment' available.\nThirdly London caters\nadequately for people\nwishing to watch strippers\nand pornography, so there\nis no need for Hon Porn night to be held even once a year at Imperial College. To sum up my objections\nto Hon Porn night, not only\nis it degrading to both\nperformers and audience,\nbut it is also u neo*6s ary.A s a man at Imperial\nCollege, I don't want to be\nbranded an animal, an\nimbecile or a sexist, so\nalthough I can appreciate\nR SM's desire to be\nautonomous, they should also realise the\nresponsibilities they have\nas part of Imperial College, and Imperial College Union. Responsibilities\nwhich cannot be lifted\nmerely by mobil ising the\nnow in famous RS M Block vote.\nYours\nPete Wilson\nComputing 2\nMorally Degrading\nDear Sir,\nThe shallow and often nonsensical commentary from\nDave Pearce of R SMU 'justifying' the R SMU 'Rugby' Club' sHon Porn Night is a fair indictment of\nthe event in itself. May we\ntry to offer what we believe\nto be reasonable and\nintelligent argument against\nsuch events.\nFirstly tradition is no\njustification for continuing\nto behave in a particular\nway. It is undoubtedly true\nthat pornographic events,\nwhilst in themselves\nbringing excitement and\n'thrills' to certain sections\nof the population, are\nmorally degrading.\nMr Pearce's contention\nthat the audience do not\nwatch pornographic events\nfor sexual pleasure is, quite\nfrankly, naive. We find it\nsurprising that, as an\nintelligent person (with A levels as well), he regards it\nsimply as some high-spirited boyish\nnaughtiness. His remarks\non sexism, particularly\nabout the lingerie industry\nin this country, show a degree of\nmisunderstanding and\ninsensitivity that is\ndisturbing.\n'Do the audience come away feeling that women are for sex only?', he asks\nhimself. The content and\ndirection of pornographic\nfilms clearly present this to\nbe a primary, if not sole\nrole of women in society.\nThis can be the only view\nbe it conscious or\nsub con sio us, one leaves\nwith after watching such a film, and one, in our view,\nwhich is as degrading to\nmen as it is to women. To present what was\nn tended by God( as Mr\nPearce tentatively argues\nand that we would maintain) to be a natural\nact between a man and\nwoman in a commited relationship (ie Marriage),\nas a public performance\nand further, the portrayal of\nu natural sex acts (whether\n'just acted' or real) is a betrayal of our self-respect\nand perversion of human\ndignity.\nIt is sad that relatively\nintelligent and sensible\npeople should find their\nexcitement and thrills in\nsexual fantasies or in\ngetting paralytic ally drunk,\nor whatever, reflecting,\nsurely, their low level of\nexpectancy of a fulfilled\nand productive life. As Christians we believe that\nJesus Christ came to offer\nthe world life\u2014a life of\nful\u00abess and purpose, Jesus said, 'I have come that they\nmay have life, and have it\nto the full' (John 10 v11); and he laid down his own\nlife that we might enjoy this\nlife now.\nYours faithfully\nSteven Burgess Civ Eng 3\nGaynor Whyles Life Sci 3\nSarah Kirk Bio Chem 2\nNick Gardner Civ Eng 2\nFELIX\nMinor Thinking\nWi i wont to go to an on porn s nite by M CP Minor (aged 10\n3/4)\nit is ill eagle in this cunt ry to\nrape wim min an so peep le like me ha v to go to strip\nshows to we rk off our\nfru stra shun.

    "content": "I Oh Christ!\n'Christians need God because of insecurity',\n'irrational superstitions',\n'hypocrites', they believe in\na God of ven gence', 'Can't think for themselves'. These are some of the many\ncriticisms of christians.\nThey are true, one or other\nof these accusations\napplies to different\nChristians, but not just\nChristians, but everybody.\nMost people don't act in\nthe way they say and a lot\nof people don't think for\nthemselves. It is well known\nthat many people follow the\ncrowd. Sometimes, with\nChristianity it is easy to fall\nin to the trap of just\nfollowing what vicar says\nbut this is because\nchristians are human and\nsuffer from the same faults\nas other people.\n'No Tommy, it is NOT an early\nform of pocket calculator...'\nChristianity is...\nChristianity is\nfundamentally based on\njust one commandment which is expressed in two\nways:\n1) Love God2) Love your neighbour\nThis is the basis for all\nthe Christian church's teaching. Admittedly, often\nthe wrong impression is\ngiven, it is easy to think\nthat God is a ruthless\ntaskmaster ready to zap his\nfollowers. There are many\nphilosophical arguments\nabout the existence of a loving God, but these are\nonly aids to belief\u2014belief\ncomes from experience. I believe the 49 bus goes to\nShepherds Bush Green \u2014 because I 've tried\nit. Few people stay within\nChristianity unless at\nsome s point they\nexperience something\nwhich makes them stay\nthroughout doubt. It would be easy to shrug this off\nby, 'I 've never experienced\nGod \u2014 so I need n't bother'.\nHowever, that isn't fair\u2014You will never know\nwhere the 49 bus goes\nunless you try it.\nChristian doctrines are\nno more incredible than\nsome of the things the\nlecturers tell us, and yet\nlecture notes are often\ntreated as infallible\ndocuments. Is what they\ntell us in lectures a true\nexpression of reality or is it\njust their personal view?\nChristianity is sometimes\nconsidered to be as\nsuperstitious\nwaffle\u2014considering so\nmany peoples (past and\npresent) have followed\nthese crazy motions they\ncan't be that silly.\nRules, rules, rules!\nChristians are not\nmindless morons who\nenslave themselves to a set\nof rules and codes because they can't think for\nPhilosophy\nEli, Eli, Le mesa bach l than i?'( My God, my God, why hast thou\nforsaken me?) These words\nof the dying Christ are a potent expression of\nhuman fear and anguish in\nthe face of death. At the\nlow points in our own lives\nwe feel lonely, de pays e', incomplete and long for\nreconciliation with another\ntotally sympathetic person,\nwe want our lives to make\nsense, to be an expression\nof something transcendent\nand not merely self-sufficient. Blaise Pascal\nreminds me that the value\nof all my other longings lies\nin their reflection of this\none obsessive desire for\nsomething to complete us.\nBut we are living in an age\nwhich finds it hard to make\nan act of faith and to reach\nan awareness of the perfect\nOther. That is not to say\nthat people do not feel the\npresence of God. They do,\nbut they are ill-prepared to\nrespond to these\npromptings.\nThe problem is that we\nhave been dressing God up\nin clothes which do not fit.\nModern scepticism has\nexposed the inadequacy of\nthemselves. One of the\npromises that Jesus made\nto his disciples is that he\ncame to set people free.\nLack of rules is not\nfreedom\u2014that's anarchy,\nand who is free when fear\nreigns. Do not murder,\nrape(etc) are all rules but\nwithout them our society\nwould crumble. I am not\nsaying laws are necessary\nto ensure peace. I am not\nbeing forced to keep any\nreligious rules\u2014there is no\nwatchful eye ready to zap\nme if I decide to rob a bank\nor jump into bed with a girl/blok e at every\nopportunity.\nI observe rules because\nthere are some actions that\nI believe are not for my\nown health of soul and\nhappiness. I freely decide to obey or not to\nobey \u2014 well not quite freely.\nI still do things that I wish I didn't, usually because I felt like it. But to say 'I just\nfelt like it' is really a cop out. What I mean is; a part\nof my subconscious still\ndictates what I do. I am not\nfully free to do what I choose. Most people admire\nBishop Tutu, Rev Martin\nLuther King and Mother\nTherese because of what\nthey have done\u2014things\nwhich most people could do, but don't.I doubt I could give up everything to\nspeak for a minority or help\nthe poor because Iam not\n'free'. Christianity has\nhelped me and many others\nto be freer, to do what ever\nI choose. That is part of\nwhat Jesus meant when he\nsaid that he had come to\nset man free.\nAdmittedly part of\nChristians' bad reputation\nis due to that some well-meaning church men have\nformalised precisely what is\nthe best way to act, cutting\nout human individuality.\nThis is a fault of theirs, not\nof Christianity.\nWhat's your God?\nEveryone has a mixture\nof many subconscious and\nconscious goals.

The commandment to love God implies relationship,\npossible because( we-believe) this transcend ant being became someone like\nus.\nIf you ask several people\nwhat a certain person they\nall know is like, between\nthem they could give you a fairly complete picture of\nthat person. If you ask just\none, the picture will be\ndod gy. The same applies\nhere, 4 people from very\ndifferent backgrounds give\nan account of what is a Christian.

One criticism which can be\nlevelled at modern science is that it tries to explain\nhuman beings in\nstraightforward physical\nterms as complex bundles\nof matter.

Friday 17 January FELIX\nTo Be A Christian...\nThe world is incredibly\nconfusing. So many ideas,\npolitical, humanitarian,\nscientific or religious are\nbandied around, each\noffering some sort of ideal\nfor life, that it can be very\ndifficult to figure out which, if any of them, should get\nour attention. Add to this\nconfusion the pressures of\nacademic work, social\nactivity, then, (later on in\nlife, making a career and\nsupporting a family and\nyou might think it quite a reasonable to say 'I haven't got time for God'. Apart\nfrom that many people say\nthat they are not the\n'religious sort', (If such a person exists I which very\nmuch doubt) probably\nmeaning that their\nconception of the average\nchurchgoer is so\nunattractive as to be a deterrent to any further\ninvestigation of the\nrelevance and truth of God. The' I haven't got time for\nGod' syndrome is a disease. If Jesus really was\nthe Son of God; if he really\ndoes make claims on our\nlives that need to be\nanswered, then it is\ninfinitely more important to\ntake the trouble to\nseriously investigate\nChristianity, than to go'to\ntwo parties this week rather\nthan one. As for the\n'religious sort', does Jesus fit the bill? Was he wet,\n^a it lj is...\nDUNCE CORNER Knowing God loves us\neve nwf> en\nweb low x it.\neffeminate, easily\ninfluenced, in need of a crutch, one for religious\nniceties....?\nWhen I was sixteen, I rejected what I had been\ntaught at school, and by\nmy parents about God. I found I had no evidence for\nmy belief, and with no\nfoundation it crumbled under testing. So I started\nto look for reasons to\nbelieve. As I looked I met\npeople who had done the\nsame thing and whose lives\nhad changed on finding\nGod. While I searched for\nGod, Jesus reached out for\nme, until after a period of\ntime I knew that I believed\nthat Jesus was the Son of\nGod and had really come to help all of us. So I decided to follow his\nteaching and commit my\nlife to Him. I did not have\nproof in the mathematical\nsense, rather sufficient\nevidence to take a step of\nfaith. Faith is not much more than acting on\nreasonable evidence. A first\ntime jet passenger may be\nincredibly uncertain before\nflying despite ample\nevidence that the plane is\nvery unlikely to crash.\nHowever, after a successful first flight, he probably has\nmore faith in planes and\nmay be willing to go on a slightly longer journey. All of us exercise faith in some way every day.\nMy faith in God means\nseveral things. First of all I know God loves me\npersonally despite my\napparent insignificance and\nbecause of his infinite\npower and perfect nature. I experience that love every\nday in an inner peace in my\nheart and through\nanswered prayer. Before\ncoming to university I spent\neight months work ng outside of Europe in a small town, in the middle of\nwhat seemed like no-where.\nEverything went wrong that\ncould have, yet, somehow, because God answered my\nprayers, I survived and\neventually overcame the\nproblems. Secondly, it\nmeans that because Jesus Christ died somehow taking on himself all the\npunishment for all the sins\nI have ever committed or\nwill commit, that I will be\nwith him after death.\nThirdly it means that\nthrough the Holy Spirit I'm not on my own trying to do\nwhat is right, but He gives\nme insight into what is\ngood and what is not, and\npower to do what is right.\nThrough God there is\npurpose, peace, hope and eternal life. I believe that he\ngives a freedom and joy in\nlife that can come from no\nother source.\nAndrew Pettman\nChe mEng4 Many of our ideas about\nGod are fuzzy to so we\ncannot afford to sit back on\nour laurels. In order to\nacquire a better\nunderstanding of the\nmysteries of life we need to\nfind them, to abstract\nourselves from the\ndemands of daily life and\ndevelop an inner quiet. \u2022\nThat alone is a step\nforward. On the other hand,\nanger is a very good response. As in personal\nrelations, anger is that\nother face of love and\nwhere it exists there is\nhope of eventual\nrecon c il ation. It is\nindifference which closes the mind.\nGod speaks to us in\ndifferent ways. Personally, I feel closest to him when I am enjoying the arts;\nreading a beautiful poem, gazing at an enchanting\npainting or listening to\nmusic. It is then that I experience moments of\ncoherence, fleeting but very\nreal and full of joy. It is the\nsplit second before such a moment that is captured by\nMichelangelo's finger of\nGod about to a nihil a tea listless Adam. Many people\ntend to be suspicious of\nany kind of religious\nexperience, dismissing it as\nmere auto-suggestion. But\nHe could deny that we are\nall made to long for\nsomething or some one\ncapable of answering our\ninner needs. CS Lewis\nperceived the value of this\ncraving when he said, 'Our\nbest having s are wanting s. Somewhere deep within\nour hearts lies a very\npersonal search for God which keeps breaking\nthrough.\nSusan Connolly A Liberal View\nThe distinguishing\nfeature of liberal theology\nis it's reliance on the power\nof reason. I believe that all\nopinions are worth talking\nout, even those of Don Cupitt, who might believe\nin God but might not.\nReason ought to rapidly\nsort out the good ideas\nfrom the bad ones.\nJust because liberals rely\non reason does not mean\nthey are rationalists. After\nall, logic is the most sterile\nof the sciences. All it can\ndo is to show that a set of\npropositions (if they are\nexpressed clearly) do not\ncontradict. The World's real\nproblems involve finding\nwhere to start.\nThis is why Jesus never\nwrote any books and never\nfounded any schools of\nthought. He did not select\nhis followers by quizzing\nthem on their ideas about\nGod, religion, morality or\neconomics he simply said:\n'Follow me'.\nHe had his priorities\nright. He thought that\ndoctrines were less\nimportant than people so\nhe broke the religious rules\nwhen they hurt people. He thought that things were\nless important than people,\nso he showed people that\nthey could live happier lives\nif they gave up their hold\non their po sessions. He believed in Love and he\nwas prepared to die rather\nthan express hate.\nToday, we have to look\nseriously at the example of\nJesus( the doctrines about\nhim too often dir.ict us\nfrom following him). Would our world be better if we\ncared more about starving\npeople than about\ndefending ourselves with\nweapons we dare not use?\nWould we not be a happier\npeople if we cared more\nabout living and less about\ncollecting the gadgets that\ncharacterise Western\nconsumer societies? Would we not be a happier society\nif we treated people as\nmore important than\nbureaucratic rules? These are the sort of questions we\nhave to ask if we are to\nfollow Jesus now.\nWe look to his example,\nthat tell us where to start.\nWe must try to follow him\nbefore it becomes worthwhile arguing about\ntheology. Christianity has\nto be tried to be believed, it\ndoes not have to be\nbelieved to be tried.\nSfeve Black\nChem PG\nFELIX Friday 17 January\n\n"
