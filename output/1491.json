Or that pang of sadness\nand longing as you came to the end of\nthe novel and had to part with the wonderful cast of characters with whom you\ntravelled though the pages of the book?\nThere\u2019s one thing in common with those\nbooks: good storytelling. Here\u2019s a brief\nrundown of the cogs and gears of what\nmakes a story engrossing.\nPlot and pace\nPlot is pretty much defined as \u2018something happening\u2019. Though plot is the\nbackbone of the story, it\u2019s surprising\nhow many modern novelists forgo plot\nin the name of avant-garde experimen-tation, resulting in a piece which feels\npretentious. Without a plot, a story is\njust a mumbo-jumbo of events.\nPlot structure is generally divided into\nthree acts: the setup, where the characters and setting are introduced; the\nconflict or confrontation where our hero\nor heroine faces an problem and is required to sort it out, and the resolution\nor climax, where everything comes together and our hero either rises triumphant or succumbs to the conflict. This\nstructure is generally known as the three\nact dramatic structure and most stories\nfall under this category.\nPace is as important as plot itself, for a\nnovel with no significant events for the\nfirst 100 pages often puts off readers (un-less of course, you are writing for a 19th\ncentury audience). A well-paced novel\nkeeps the reader constantly engaged by\nstriking a fine balance between exposition and moving the plot. This balance\nis more important in science fiction and\nfantasy novels where whole imagined\nworlds must be introduced to the reader.\nAn elaborately detailed world lays the\nground for more complex stories and\ngives the reader immense satisfaction\nwhen the events unfold through the\nsecond and third act, provided they continue reading up to there.\nThere are plenty of plot devices to\ndrive the plot and rhythm of the story,\nbut as space is constrained, only two\nwill be discussed here. Continuity is\nwhen the author plants an item in the\nearly part of the story only to bring it\nout later in the plot to solve a conflict.\nA well-executed continuity brings about\nthe \u2018Ah! That\u2019s genius,\u2019 moment from\nreaders. Continuity is key to a good plot\ntwist.\nOn the other side of the coin, there\nis the deus ex machina, a plot device\ning conclusion they deserve for sticking\nwith the story for so long. Though not\nspecifically book-related, but nevertheless a good recent example of an otherwise good story lost to dues ex machina\nin storytelling is James Cameron\u2019s Avatar. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Inception, on\nthe other hand, was such a satisfying film\nbecause it did not break its internal logic\neven when things got rough.\nThe importance of plot goes way back\ninto the antiquities: Aristotle, discussing\ndramatic theory in his seminal Poetics,\nconsidered plot more important than\ncharacters. Which brings us to the next\nmain element of a story.\nCharacters\nIs characterisation second to plot in\nwhat makes a story good? Would Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s Lolita achieve the masterpiece status it enjoys had Humbert\nHumbert not been the colourful and\nintriguing character he is? Would Yann\nMartel\u2019s Life of Pi have won the Booker\nhad Pi been merely as interesting as a\npie? Going further back, would Milton\u2019s\nParadise Lost have stayed eternal had it\nnot been for the charismatic Satan?\nCharacters are what grounds readers\nto the story. It is with the characters that\nthe readers empathise with, and empa-The art of storytelling\nGuo Heng Chin guides us through the nuts and bolts of a good story\nthy is the bridge that connects the reality of the reader to the reality of the\nstory-world. I\u2019d like to think of characters as an avatar for readers to enter\nand explore the world of the story, very\nmuch like the Na\u2019vi avatars used by the\nhumans in Avatar.\nWhat makes a protagonist interesting?\nAmbiguity and depth is always appeal-ing. A knight in shining armor with unshakable devotion to the good is vanilla.\nThrow in a dash of the dark side, and a\nsprinkle of flaw like arrogance or self-doubt, and you get one engaging char-acter. That\u2019s why Darth Vader is cooler\nthan Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nOr you can just make him or her tragically flawed like the Miltonian Satan\nwhose own perpetual arrogance brought\nhis downfall. You have to admit though,\nit\u2019s hard not to like a character who still\nvaunts aloud amidst racking internal\nemotions.\nOr it could be just that the readers find\nit easy to relate to the protagonist. Bella\nSwan of the Twilight Saga is probably\nthe most one-dimensional character\nin modern literature but yet an empire\nwas spun out of the Twilight books and\nmovies (Kristen Stewart is no better at\nplaying her) because she lives the dream\ngirls and Twilight mums around the\nworld can only fantasise about. Harry\nPotter started out interesting as he struggled to come to terms with the sudden\nheap of fame and infamy dropped on his\nlap as he stepped into Hogwarts for the\nfirst time, but in the last few books, he\nseems to have his gearstick jammed at\nthe angsty teenager gear.\nNarrative and style\nA good story stays in the mind of the\nreader after they finish the book, but a\ngood story with great delivery etches\nitself on the memory of the readers. Storytelling methods have changed drastically from the Dickensian time when\nan omnipotent third person narrative is\nconventional. The first person narrative\nis the norm for modern literature; the argument is that it allows the readers to get\ninto the mind of the character more eas-ily. The third person POV is still alive,\nthough more often in science fiction and\nfantasy where there is a more pressing\nneed to describe the world around the\ncharacters while modern literature prefers to deal with the internal, emotional\nenvironment of the character.\nNarrative became more creative in the\n20th century with literary colossuses\nJames Joyce and Virginia Wolf innovating the stream of consciousness narrative which seeks to emulate the thought\nprocess. William Faulkner\u2019s The Sound\nand the Fury tells the same event from\ndifferent character POVs. Rushdie\u2019s\nrevered Midnight\u2019s Children draws its\nnarrative style from the Indian storytelling tradition: for the first time readers (I\nwas one of them) it might seem discon-certing, but once you get used to it it\u2019s a\njolly fun ride down the surreal India he\ndescribes.\nExperimentation with language forms\nthe other facet of storytelling. No writer\nother than Vladimir Nabokov has such\neminence as an English prose stylist.\nHis Lolita remains the epitome of prose\nstyle; it\u2019s the only prose work that exudes such finesse in wordplay and wit\nand an abundance of luxuriant imager-ies that it reads like poetry.\nPutting it all together\nImpeccable plot and pace, brilliant char-acterisation and innovative narrative are\ntenets of a good story but of course they\nare not the only elements that make a\nclassic out of a novel. Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas\nShrugged has not the best writing nor\nnarrative (it desperately needs an editor\nto trim it down), but its ambitious and\ncontroversial themes were what writ her\nname and the novel on stone. Nevertheless, those three elements are the fundamentals of most good storytelling and\nare executed to perfection in some of\nour most cherished stories.\nwhich, in my opinion should be avoided\nat all costs, for nothing spoils a good\nstory as much as a deus ex machina.\nThe Latin term translates to \u2018god out of\nthe machine\u2019; it originates from ancient\nGreek tragedies where the actor portraying a god is lowered onto the stage by\na crane. A deus ex machina is when the\nwriter resorts to employing an improbable device which was not previously\nintroduced, or a plot which defies the internal logic in order to excavate his or her\ncharacters out of a mire and resolve the\nconflict (e.g. an omnipotent entity suddenly emerges and solves all the prob-lem). A dues ex machina turns to dust all\nthe effort spent developing the plot and\nshortchanges the audience of the satisfy-Valentin Paul being an absolute boss, we wouldn\u2019t expect any less\n\u201cThrow in a dash of\nthe dark side [...] and\nyou get one engaging\ncharacter. That\u2019s\nwhy Darth Vader is\ncooler than Obi-Wan\nKenobi\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n10\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 03 june 2011\nRatko Mladi\u0107 arrested\nA couple of weeks ago, Osama bin Laden\nwas found and killed in Pakistan by the US.\nAs is usually the case, a lot of banter and ridicule followed \u2013 one of which was a picture\nof Osama Bin Laden titled \u2018Hide and Seek\nChampion: 2001\u2013 2011\u2019. I remember thinking\nthat he wasn\u2019t the champion, there were still\nmany war criminals and the like at large such\nas Ratko Mladi\u0107 \u2013 the man who masterminded\nthe genocide in Srebrenica and presented it as a\n\u2018gift\u2019 to the Serbian nation. I wondered whether he\u2019d ever be caught.\nLast week, as some of you might know, Ratko Mladi\u0107 was indeed arrested in Serbia. The\nhead of the Yugoslavian National Army (JNA)\nand the one who executed Karad\u017ei\u0107\u2019s vision\nverbatim all over Bosnia, has been \u2013 as an\nunbelievable amount of westerners like to eloquently say \u2013 \ufb01nally brought to justice. I don\u2019t\nquite agree and I\u2019d like to share my reasoning\nwith you.\nJust like Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Radovan\nKarad\u017ei\u0107, Mladi\u0107 will be taken to the Hague\nand put on trial for his war crimes, prominently displayed in front of the western public and\nthat is about as much as the West can do. Quite\nfrankly, it is not enough. I don\u2019t want to sound\ntoo contemptuous when I say all of this, but\na trial in the Hague is de\ufb01nitely not what the\nde\ufb01nition of justice is. Prisoners in the Hague\nare more comfortable than you and I have ever\nbeen \u2013 the Detention Unit is described as \u201cthe\nHague Hilton\u201d, and anyone can watch a video\ntour of how luxuriously war criminals have it\nthere. Moreover, the running cost of all of the\ntrials of former-Yugoslavian war criminals is\nabout $1.2 billion (estimated back in 2008).\nMoney that could have been better spent in\nhelping the victims and their families somewhat recover. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 no money\ncould ever make up for the damage that has\nbeen done, the lives that have been lost, the\nsuffering my people have endured since 1992,\nbut it would help.\nTo put it in plain language, justice cannot be\nsatis\ufb01ed in this case. Not ever. And that is the\npainful truth we have to learn to accept. You\ncannot bring back the dead, you cannot undo\nmurders, rapes, unspeakable torture and the\nhorrors the West Balkan people have survived\nin concentration camps. Justice most certainly\nwill never be satis\ufb01ed for the genocide survivors of Srebrenica. It will not bring back the\nmassacred children of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever, his capture is a good thing. Somewhat comforting news and a lot of us will sigh\nwith relief tonight.\nI also happen to have an exam tomorrow \u2013\njust a few hours away from writing this, but I\nhonestly do not care. I\u2019ve wasted enough time\ngoing over online articles. Most of the foreign\nreactions are, unsurprisingly, quite na\u00efve in\nparts, too optimistic and they sound like clueless happy-ending-believers.\nLast term I wrote an article about Lilly Ebert, a holocaust survivor, and the events that\nlife put on her shoulders. She might not have\nknown that in the audience, there was a German student, sitting and listening to her every\nword. It was he who later asked her a question\n\u2013 one I found was unbelievably insightful:\n\u201cHave you gone back to Germany or shared\nyour story with the German youth? How did\nthey react?\u201d It was the one question Mrs. Ebert\nseemed startled to have been asked. She did\nnot smile, but replied nevertheless:\n\u201cI have not gone back to Germany and would\nnot talk to Germans of my age. I\u2019d wonder\nwhat they had been doing during the war and\nwhether they submitted to the general murderous convention that Hitler preached. I wouldn\u2019t\nlike to meet people of my own age, and I\u2019d feel\nuneasy meeting the German youth of today\n\u2013 I\u2019d wonder what their parents did and with\nwhat ideologies they have been brought up\u201d.\nThat is quite understandable. Time could\nnever erase the horrors she had been through.\nI wonder whether there are enough Serbians\nout there who would listen to what a Bosnian\nconcentration camp survivor has to say. Hitler\nand his chief war architects shot themselves\nand later the Nuremberg trials were carried\nout, their signi\ufb01cance being substantially\nmore important as they were held on German\nterritory. Justice was brought to the heart of\nGermany and spread via Nuremberg throughout the country we today admire. Distance\ndwindles the seriousness of monstrous deeds,\nand to put that in today\u2019s perspective: the\nHague might be a good idea, but it de\ufb01nitely\nis not the best one. Democracy can only come\nfrom within the country itself, remorse and\nshame can only be felt throughout the Serbian\nnation once the crimes that have been committed are recognised and categorically convicted by their leaders. No reconciliation can\nbe achieved in that area until the ones who\nhave committed these atrocities come forward\nwith their repentance. Boris Tadi\u0107 (Serbia\u2019s\ncurrent President) is not the one to ask for\nforgiveness; Karad\u017ei\u0107, Mladi\u0107, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and\nthe like are. His words will not be listened to\nby the chetniks (\u010detnici) who rallied for Ratko\nMladi\u0107 just half an hour away from Sarajevo. Support has been prominently displayed\nall over Youtube videos and Facebook pages\nfor Mladi\u0107 just hours after his arrest was\ncon\ufb01rmed. All of these featured promises of\na new war in the Balkans and prophecies of\nthe \u2018next Mladi\u0107\u2019. My whole body twitches\nat the thought of this. I can still see, written\nin capital letters: RATKO MLADI\u0106, SRPSKI\nHEROJ (Ratko Mladi\u0107, Serbian hero). Tadi\u0107\u2019s\nwords will be considered a betrayal to the true\nSerbian blood and this is what was chanted\nby the chetniks. He is a start though \u2013 I just\nhope he doesn\u2019t get overpowered and crushed\neventually.\nWikileaks recently released documents that\nsaid that the Serbian government knew where\nRatko Mladi\u0107 was up to 2009. They released\ndocuments with tips on his whereabouts which\nwere sent by the US of\ufb01cials to Belgrade and\nwere completely ignored. Now it seems he\u2019ll\nreceive the best medical care the world has to\noffer, which might postpone his death for a\nyear or two, but I highly doubt we\u2019ll see him\nconvicted. A d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu from Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s case.\nThere indeed is no justice in the world, only\nour attempts at evening out the consequences.\nFinally, there is a common link between\nthe Balkan radicals (the Balije, Usta\u0161e and\n\u010cetnici): they are (mostly) uneducated, village\nfolk who are brought up in communities which\nhave been concentrated in small areas, manipulated by religious and political leaders into\nbelieving that serving them is \u2018serving God\u2019s\nwill\u2019. They believe that they are a chosen nation and are brainwashed from their cradles by\na neo-nazi-like ideology. You also get the other\nextreme: I for one \ufb01nd it startling that Radovan\nKarad\u017ei\u0107 was educated at Columbia University, New York (an Ivy League school, yes).\nStill, the most alarming thing about the rallies\nin Mladi\u0107\u2019s name was that there were many\nchildren and youth standing side-by-side with\ntheir grandparents, Serbian \ufb02ags in some hands\nand Mladi\u0107\u2019s portraits in others. It sickens me\nthat this is today\u2019s reality.\nThere is hope for the future nevertheless.\nLast year, after the refusal of the Serbian Government to put forward a document acknowledging Serbia\u2019s involvement in the war in\nBosnia and that there had been a genocide in\nSrebrenica just a decade ago, 20 young Serbian members of the Youth Initiative for Human\nRights spray-painted across the Assembly\u2019s\nentrance: \u0422a \u0442\u0435\u0448\u043aa \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0446 \u2018\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0434\u2019 (that\ntough foreign word \u2018genocide\u2019). Kudos to you\nmy friends.\nNaida Dzigal\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nGermany\nIndonesian officials have rebuffed claims of animal\ncruelty after Australia halted exports to some facili-ties. This follows an Australian TV documentary that\nshows animals being flogged, kicked and slashed\nwith knives. An Indonesian official has said that the\ndocumentary wasn\u2019t reflective and only focused on\nthe bad abattoirs, adding that Indonesia is committed to producing meat that is safe, secure, healthy\nand halal. Some Australian MPs have called for a\ncomplete ban on cattle exports to Indonesia after\nthe airing of the documentary on grounds of animal\ncruelty.\nIndonesia\nGermany\u2019s coalition government\nhas announced\nit will close all\nnuclear power\nplants by 2022.\nLast September\nChancellor Angela Merkel had\nreversed the previous government\u2019s plan to close plants by 2021,\nand instead chose to extend their lives by a further\n7 years. However, this sudden U-turn came about\nas the centre-right coalition dipped in popularity and\nfears grew over nuclear power following the Japanese\nearthquake.\nSudan\nNorth and South Sudan have agreed to set up a\njointly patrolled demilitarised zone on their common border in a deal mediated by the African Union.\nThis comes after the North seized the troubled region of Abyei 10 days ago. Abyei is claimed by both\nthe nomadic Arab Miseriya tribe and the Dinka Ngok\nand is a source of contention between the North\nand the South after a planned referendum was postponed indefinitely. The proposed demilitarised zone\nwill stretch along the entire 2110km border and will\nhave a depth of up\nto 10km. However,\nit is not clear if it\nwill be 10km in\ntotal or 10km on\neach side of the\nborder.\nCaught after 16 years of hiding\nBut he\u2019ll never face true justice at the Hague\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nJoseph Letts\nRajat Jain\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\n\u201cYou cannot undo the\nhorrors the West Balkan\npeople have survived in\nconcentration camps\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX\n20\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nVeronika McQuadeova\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 03 june 2011\nGlee: It\u2019s time to start believing\nMatt Allinson relented, watched the damned show, and found out he liked it\nA\nlthough difficult to explain in purely logical\nterms, especially when\none takes into account\nthe stratospheric amount\nof money produced by this show, its\nworld tour, album sales and branded\nlunchbox tie-ins, I think that Glee is\nunderrated. Undoubtedly if you haven\u2019t\nalready stopped reading this article it\u2019s\nsafe to assume that your eyebrows are\nraised so high right now they\u2019d be shot\ndown over Libya, so allow me to justify\nsuch an outrageous claim.\nStraight off the bat I feel the need\nto declare that I live with two women,\nwomen who watch videos of kittens on\nthe internet and insist on the flat having\nweird things like fluffy cushions, blankets on the sofa, and a clean shower.\nFurthermore, my beloved girlfriend is\nan active member of Imperial\u2019s fantastic\nFinancial Times pointed out, it makes\ngood financial sense to appeal to teenagers who feel like outsiders. It also makes\ngood financial sense to produce brilliant\npop music, so by combining both, Glee\nis on to a total winner.\nAll the above can be confidently\nstated without seeing a single minute\nof the show, but what took me by surprise and pulled me into the show was\nthe little-commented-on fantastic sense\nof humour. Sue Sylvester, the cheerleading coach bent on the destruction\nof the Glee club, is the best example\nof a comedy arch-nemesis character on\ntelevision at the moment. The rate at\nwhich the scriptwriters have attempted\nto include story lines about every single\naspect of teenage life, coupled with the\nfact that the show has to fit in at least\n3 full-length musical numbers, leaves\nGlee with a plot about as subtle as\nPippa Middleton\u2019s arse. However the\nfrantic pace of the show adds breathlessness to the comedy which makes it\nfunnier, helped by some expert timing\nfrom the all-singing and dancing cast.\nSo yeah it\u2019s auto-tuned in places and is\nsingle-handedly responsible for Journey\nreforming and bringing out a new al-bum, two crimes which it takes a lot to\ncompensate for.

Investors, who read\nbusiness plans every day, will be able\nto tell whether a business might have a\nfuture or not just by reading the opening paragraph.\nNext, you will have to write a detailed description about your product or\nservice.

Potential investors will look at this section carefully to make sure there is a viable method\nto reach the target market identified\nat a cost that does not jeopardize your\npotential for profits. Developing an innovative marketing plan could play a\nlarge part in your success, as investors\nlook favourably upon creative strategies that will put your product or service in front of potential customers.\nAnother important part of the business plan is the part where you show\nthat you understand who your competition is, and what its strengths and weaknesses are.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 03 june 2011 15\nARTS\nSo often in the media you hear directors\nand people of the arts talking of their\ndesire to \u2018transport\u2019 the reader or viewer\nor listener, whatever it might be, away\nfrom their mundane reality. Whether the\ndestination is Richmond, Rio or Ancient\nRome, all too often you can find yourself back in that reality in a matter of\nseconds. As I walked out of Mad Blud, I\ncould not say the same, but not entirely\ndue to the play itself.\nMad Blud is an exploration of London knife crime, the brainchild of Philip\nOsment. The piece brings together\ninterviews with victims, perpetrators\nand a wide range of those involved in\nbetween, all brought to life by actors\nthrough \u2018verbatim theatre\u2019 \u2013 they learn\nno script but rather hear the words recited through headphones. As the lights\nwent down, my eyebrows were raised,\nbut I was soon too involved to waste energy on looking skeptical.\nThe style brought with it a freshness\nand an air of credibility, although at\ntimes the cast seemed to lack the full\nemotion that their words appeared to cry\nout for. Nevertheless, the stories retain\nthe mark of the real characters, as they\nare handled with a delicacy that delivers\nthe message with a real punch (no pun\nintended). Mad Blud\u2019s strength comes\nin it being so far from the portrayal of\nknife-crime that gets trolleyed out by\nthe press. Without showering you in\nnumbers, it educates through personal\naccounts. It gives humanity to the sta-tistics, a feat that I cannot laud enough.\nThrough the reformed gang member,\nthe grieving mother, the church community discussing the decay of society, the\naudience is given glimpses into several\ncases, each with their own colour and\npersonality.\nMad Blud made for an informative\nand engaging production but it was\nthe Q&A session at the end that really\ntransformed the experience for me. As\nis always the case with these things, the\nball is pretty slow to get rolling and only\nstarted with a few ostensibly seasoned\ntheatre types pointing out a few technical points they enjoyed. I\u2019ll confess,\neven I mentally ruminated on what I\nmight say if picked on. What I hadn\u2019t\nbanked on was the person sitting behind me commenting that they particularly appreciated the portrayal of Jamal,\nI think seeing Mad Blud a few days\nbefore Anya Reiss\u2019 new play at the\nRoyal Court stood me in good stead.\nWho knows what sharp edged trouble I\nmight have unwittingly meandered into\non the walk from South Ken to Sloane\nSquare? That said, any potential crossfire that was avoided on the journey\ndown, was certainly not in the hour and\na half that followed.\nThe Acid Test, Reiss\u2019 second play,\ninvites us into the front room of three\ntwenty-something girls on the night\nthat their swirling maelstrom of lady\nissues is interrupted by the arrival\nof one of their fathers, evicted by his\nmissus and her new beau, the roofer.\nDana, a flirty blonde, is toying with the\nidea of sleeping with her boss, purely\nfor professional progress and deterred\nseemingly only by his gingerness; the\nshrill and somewhat ditsy Ruth returns\nfresh from being dumped by her arty\nboyfriend; and Jess, daughter of Jim,\nappears more stressed by her father\u2019s\npresence than anything else. Open the\ndrinks cupboard and a lot of heart-to-hearts, DMCs and soul baring ensues.\nThe play does well in the breadth of\nissues it touches upon, even if a few\nsound as though they\u2019re straight off\nthe MiddleClassProblem twitter feed\n(which also comes highly recommend-ed). It portrays to a T the frictions of\nparent-child relationships and the endless supply of embarrassment the former always bring when visiting their\noffspring \u2013 never again will I listen to\nMarvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Get It On\u2019 without thinking of Denis Lawson, cast as\nJim, grooving on down after a few neat\nvodkas.\nBut such can surely be expected from\na playwright aged 19 (I refuse to go\ninto more detail, the thought of such\nprecocious success doesn\u2019t help the revision go down.) Self-worth, married\nlife, sexual desire and sometimes sexual ambivalence all come under Reiss\u2019\nmagnifying glass and whilst the style is\nfast paced, fluid and very satisfying, the\nsubstance is a little thin. The comedy is\nrich, written scientifically, and the denouement draws to a tidy finish, not before a few twists. In all, she reminds me\nslightly of Chelsea\u2019s own local football\nteam \u2013 technically very good, just short\nof a little magic and not quite hitting the\ntarget as was the case a few years ago.\nThe production in general has a vital-ity, no doubt due in part to the lively\nperformances from Vanessa Kirby and\nPhoebe Fox, the latter\u2019s talent belied by\nher single line of past theatrical work.\nDennis Lawson gives weight to the cast\nand galvanizes the comedy opposite the\nseemingly effortlessly sour-faced Lydia\nWilson, who brings the same ice to the\nrole as she displayed in The Heretic.\nThe intimacy of the studio, effectively\nthe Royal Court\u2019s attic, is exploited\nto the full, rather than take down the\nfourth wall, they let the audience sit on\nand around it.\nThe Acid Test is a very tight work\nthat mixes two parts home truths to one\npart comedy and tops it up with sheer\nenergy and watch-ability. Serve with\nDennis Lawson and promising trio of\nyoung talent and can\u2019t you go wrong.\nI, for one, am keen to see what Reiss\noffers up next.\nwho was stabbed in a playground in\nWalthamstow several years ago, as they\nwent to school with him currently. My\njaw dropped. Theatre can widen your\nempathy to knife-crime, but I\u2019d never\nanticipated to be looking into the eyes\nof a girl visibly younger than myself\nwho knew first-hand the subject of the\nplay I\u2019d just watched. She looked na\u00efve\nand unworried and yet she was living\nwith the grisly issue this entire project\nwas attempting tackle. And she wasn\u2019t\nalone, other friends, community support workers and prison officers came\nforward and shared their opinions, even\nadding real detail to the stories I\u2019d just\nbeen told.\nI realize this is likely to be unique to\nmy experience, even if it wasn\u2019t; I\u2019ve\nlessened the surprise somewhat. But\nit was built on the revealing insight of\nMad Blud and I cannot stress enough\nthe degree to which I admire project\nsuch as this. Topics like knife-crime are\nimpossible to pin down, which makes\nits accomplishments all more impres-sive. This theatre isn\u2019t perfect, but its\nintentions are more than noble.\nMad Blud has ended\nMad Blud does good\nExploring London knife crime on stage\nThe Acid Test makes the grade\nA \u2018girly night in\u2019 makes for a great night out\nWill Prince\nWill Prince\nFred Durst: The Musical, the only thing worse than the Spiderman musical\nJane Hobson\nManuel Harlan\nCrying on a sofa with a bottle of vodka?

    "content": "FELIX 23\nTRAVEL\nFRIDAY 03 JUNE 2011\nICELAND\nGUO HENG CHIN SPENDS TWO WEEKS\nIN THE GREAT ICELANDIC OUTDOORS\nT\nhe eruption of the glacial volcano\nEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull last year severely disrupted European airspace\nbut pinned Iceland on the tourist\nmap. It\u2019s easy to see why the island in the middle of the North Atlantic was\nnot exactly the place most opt to go for vaca-tion: it is not heir to a rich cultural heritage as\nmany European countries are, nor does it exude an exotic charm and sun of Asian escapes.\nHowever, Iceland does evoke its own sort of\ncharm. I was in the capital of Iceland, Reykjavik for two weeks to work on my MSc project\nduring which I had the chance to sample controversial Icelandic dishes, frequent the city\u2019s\ngeothermal pools popular amongst the locals\nand explore the great outdoors that Iceland\nhad to offer.\nReykjavik\nReykjavik is the northernmost capital in the\nworld and is believed to be the place where\nthe first Viking settlers who founded Iceland\nsettled. Today, half of Iceland\u2019s population\nlives in Reykjavik.\nLike all capitals, it is home to the country\u2019s best museums. Icelandic museums are\nhumble compared to the ones in Europe, but\nare still a rich source of Icelandic culture.\nThe Culture House holds the Icelandic Saga\nmuseum on its ground floor. The sagas are\nIceland\u2019s cherished literary heritage and also\nserve as a historical account of Icelandic life\nduring the middle ages.\nWhale watching is another attraction in\nReykjavik. It cost about \u20ac40 to go on a trip\nwhich lasts for a few hours. In the summer\nmonths, the whale watching boats drop by\nthe puffin colonies as well. However, whale\nsighting is not guaranteed on the trips.\nFrom Reykjavik you can drive or follow\na tour around the Golden Triangle circuit,\nwhich covers the Gullfoss waterfall, Geysir\nand \u00deingvellir (\u00de is pronounced as th-) National Park, three of Iceland\u2019s popular sights.\nAurora sighting trips are available all year\nround, but are weather dependent.\nHowever, everything in Iceland is exorbitantly priced, especially eating out. A simple\nmeal in a restaurant puts you back 2000 Icelandic Kronur (\u00a310). A paperback costs \u00a313.\nAnd a pint of beer costs \u00a35!\nHot pools and hot chicks\nOne of the distinctive attractions in Iceland is\nthe geothermal pools. The pools are not just\ntourist spots; they are also the social hub for\nIcelanders. Maybe the cut-throat price of alcohol makes the pub less appealing for socialis-ing. the thermal pools fulfill a social function\nvery much like the pubs in Britain.\nThe rich geothermal resources in Iceland\nhave given rise to a large number of thermal pools across Iceland and cheap access\nas well. Geothermal water used to be channeled directly into the pool but the rich mineral content corrodes the pipes, so now they\nuse the geothermal water to heat up normal\nwater (that\u2019s how much geothermal resources\nthey have), so I was a bit disappointed that\nit does not reek of sulphur like some of the\nnatural onsen in Japan. The water in the pool\nis treated with minimal chlorine, so you are\nexpected to shower thoroughly before you enter the pool.\nI read once that Iceland has the highest proportion of good-looking women in the world\nand I did not believe it until I went to the thermal pools. After visiting the thermal pools\nevery alternate evening (to chill out of course,\nnothing else!) I can vouch that it\u2019s statistically\nsignificant that there are an inordinate proportion of beautiful women in Iceland (Reykjavik\nat least). The thermal pools are like a beach in\nsummer, and most of the Scandinavian beauties are clad in bikinis even though the temperature above the water is a chilling 3-4 degrees\ncelcius. There must be something in the water.\nMoby Dick and the most disgusting food\non earth\nCulinary experience has always been one of\nthe things I look out for when I am travelling.\nIceland may not have the most innovative cui-sines, but it does have cuisines that can not\nbe found anywhere else in the world. The\nfirst is whale meat. Iceland is one of the few\ncountries in the world where whale is commercially hunted.\nTraditionally, whale meat has been consumed as cheap meat. In the late 1980s, a moratorium was imposed on commercial whaling,\nbut was lifted in 2006. Now Moby Dick is\nmaking a comeback on restaurant menus.\nMy first taste of the largest mammal in the\nworld was in the form of a burger at a hip restaurant bar called Geysir in downtown Reykjavik. Moby Dick has a similar tangy texture\nand seared appearance to its bovine counter-part, but a much richer and fuller flavour. It\nhas a distinctive bloody aftertaste, and if you\nlike your beef rare, you would enjoy a loin of\nMoby Dick.\nMoby Dick is available as steak and even on\na stick as kebabs. But the best whale meat I\u2019ve\never tried was at an upmarket sushi restaurant\nan Icelandic friend recommended me. It\u2019s a\nbit on the expensive side, but definitely worth\nvisiting just for its whale sashimi. The smoked\nslice of Moby Dick wrapped in a core of wasabi\ncream cheese, watercress and pickle bursts with\nheavenly flavour as you take a bite. Dipped in\nthe specially prepared citrus and olive oil soy\nsauce, it was hands down the best culinary indulgence I experienced in Reykjavik.\nHakarl (pronounced hau-kat), or rotten\nshark, is the most infamous of Icelandic cui-sines. Made from rotting Greenland sharks\nfor 6 months, it has a fearsome reputation and\neating it is considered a feat of manliness.\nGordon Ramsay puked while eating it. Anthony Bourdain called it \u201cthe single worst, most\ndisgusting and terrible tasting thing [he\u2019s ever\neaten]\u201d. It evoked gastronomical terror when\nI mentioned hakarl to Icelanders; amongst the\ncomments I got from them: \u201cyou only eat it\nonce in your life.\u201d, and \u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat something that tastes like urine\u2026\u201d.\nHakarl\u2019s reputation stems from its overwhelming ammonia smell, which invokes a\ngag response from first timers. It comes in un-menacing light brown cubes. The hakarl has a\nchewy texture and it\u2019s only when you munch\nit for a while that the ammonia stench assaults\nyour taste buds and nostrils. Never kiss after\neating it, advised a local.\nVenturing into Earth\u2019s butt-crack\nIceland may not be well known for its outdoor\nactivities, but it does have some very interesting and unique spots for those seeking adven-ture. Glacial hiking is certainly a trip worth do-ing. There is a glacier is two and a half hours\naway from the capital popular among adventure companies but is large enough that you\nfeel that you are the only human there. You\ncan try your hands on ice climbing on some of\nthe ice walls.\nThose with a diving qualification might be\ntempted to dive in one of the most unique diving sites in the world. Located in the \u00deingvellir National Park, Silfra is the rift between\nthe Eurasian and North American continental plates, and is a UNESCO World Heritage\nsite. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s probably the only place\nin the world where you can dive in between\ntwo continents. It\u2019s an open water dive like no\nother because it feels like diving in a water-filled cave; you dive through winding crevices\n4-5m apart, and though you stay at the depth\nof 10m most of the time, right below you is\na fall of up to 30m! Silfra also has a stonking\nvisibility of over 100m, making it one of the\nbest viz sites for diving anywhere in the world.\nThe National Park is also home to the world\u2019s\noldest parliament, right next to the Silfra crack.\n\n"

The\nresearchers tested 33 men, aged between 18\nand 35, in an experiment based on three ses-sions.\nIn the first session (incidental learning), the\nparticipants were shown a computer-based\nseries of slides depicting a story with neutral\nand emotional phases. A few hours later participants were asked to recall this information.\nSaliva samples of the participants were taken\nto find the cortisol levels at different times.\nIn the second session (retrieval phase), the\nsame procedure was applied with the participants divided in three groups. One group received a single dose of the drug, one group had\na double dose and the third were given a pla-cebo. The experiments tested memory recall at\nthe time when cortisol levels were expected to\nbe at their lowest value.\nThe third session (delayed recall) involved\nthe same procedure without the administration\nof the drug or the placebo.\nThe scientists found that there was a significant decrease in cortisol values when a double\ndose of Metyrapone was taken.\nThe double dose group also recalled significantly less emotional information than the\nplacebo group at both retrieval and delayed recall phases, whereas there was little difference\nbetween the single and double dose groups.\nOverall, there was no loss of neutral information but there was an effect on emotional\nmemory retrieval.\n\u201cOur findings may help people deal with\ntraumatic events by offering them the opportunity to \u2018write-over\u2019 the emotional part of their\nmemories during therapy,\u201d said lead author\nMarie-France Marin.\nThe experimental conditions introduce some\nlimitations to the validity of the results ob-tained. Firstly, only men were tested on and\nhence one cannot conclude the effects Metyrapone may have on women. Secondly, the\ndrug was tested on perfectly healthy men so\nit may not have the same effect on patients\nsuffering from PTSD or any other medical\ncondition for which the drug may actually\nbe required. Thirdly it is difficult to conclude\nwhether the effects seen are due to the presence of Metyrapone or low levels of cortisol.\nEternal sunshine for the stressful mind\nAnum Niaz\nHIV patients who take antiretroviral therapy\n(ART) early enough not only protect themselves but also their partners, new research has\nshown.\nThe finding is the first from a major randomized clinical trial to indicate that treating an\nHIV-infected person can make them less conta-gious, as well as keep them healthy.\nThe study, which spanned nine countries, involved more than 1,700 couples, in which one\npartner was HIV-positive and the other was not.\nEach couple was randomly assigned to one of\ntwo study groups by researchers at the University of North Carolina, US.\nIn the first group, the partner with HIV began receiving antiretroviral drugs as soon as\nthey enrolled in the study. In the second group,\nthe infected partner started antiretroviral treatment once their CD4+ count \u2013 a key measure\nof immune system health \u2013 fell to between 200\nand 250 cells/mm3\n, or when they developed an\nAIDS-related illness.\nAccording to the results, 27 previously unin-fected partners in the second group contracted\nHIV from their partner. But in the first group,\nonly one such case of new HIV infection oc-curred. This means that starting ART earlier led\nto a 96% reduction in HIV transmission within\nrelationships.\nUK HIV charities have given a cautious welcome to the news. Sarah Radcliffe, a policy\nofficer at the National Aids Trust (NAT) said\nthe findings backed up anecdotal evidence. She\nadded: \u201cThese results are very exciting. Back\nin 2008, the Swiss Federal Commission for\nHIV/AIDS published a statement saying that\npatients on effective ART who have no other\nsexually transmitted infections are sexually\nnon-infectious. This is the first time we have an\nexperiment which backs this up. The fact that it\nfinished early is very significant and it is a very\nrobust piece of research.\u201d\nAVERT spokesperson Rachel King described\nthe research as \u201ccompelling\u201d but continued:\n\u201cScaling up testing to improve knowledge of\nHIV status and increasing treatment coverage\nwill be crucial to gaining the public health benefits of treatment as prevention.\u201d Universal access\nto treatment was still the main goal, she added.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust, however, suggested that the research could have more impact in the developing world than in Britain.\nBlake Smith, information officer at the trust,\nsaid: \u201cWith up to one in four people with HIV\nbeing undiagnosed in the UK, the people who\nare likely to be most infectious are not under\ncare and so would not receive treatment.\u201d\nBen Jones\nPartners protected from early HIV drugs\n7 \u2013 12 June 2011\n\u201cExplore wonderful things, take your mind to new\nplaces or simply have a great night out\u201d. From stem\ncells to the science of plasma, the festival explores\na whole universe of different ideas and theories.\nCheltenham Science Festival\nPrevention is better than cure \u2013 early treatment prevents HIV spreading to others\nDon\u2019t cry, there are drugs to help you forget just how bad that film actually was\nAvian Attraction\nWhen it comes to choosing a mate, female sparrows have shown they\u2019re anything but bird-brained.\nAccording to new research, the feathered females\ndon\u2019t simply pick the most physically attractive, but\ninstead assess the quality of their potential suitor\u2019s\ninner values.\nIt all comes down to a cluster of genes that play\na role in immunity, called the major histocompatibil-ity complex (MHC). Researchers from the University\nof Veterinary Medicine in Vienna examined preferences for partners in house sparrows by offering a\nfemale sparrow a choice of three different males.\nThey found females with a low number of MHC alleles were most attracted to males carrying a high\nnumber of such alleles, suggesting females can\n\u201ccount\u201d the number of MHC alleles on offer from\nindividual males. The evidence is the first to suggest birds\u2019 mating preferences are influenced by the\nMHC. Thea Cunningham\n\n"

Mainly so\nthat fat people can shift the blame for\nall the times they ripped their trousers when\nkneeling down (\u201cif it weren\u2019t for the Higgs\nparticle I\u2019d be wafer-thin!\u201d). The discovery did\nnot, however, occur in the supercooled coolness that is the LHC, but in fact in a lowly undergraduate student\u2019s bedroom one morning as\nhe was looking for that one missing sock that\nyou can never find. We tracked down this extraordinary individual for an interview:\n\u201cHonestly I forgot I even had that. Last\n[night] me and my housemates got pretty\nblasted at the union and as we wandered back\nhome we just found it in a garbage pile outside\nBurger King. My mate was like \u2018dude I think\nthat\u2019s the Higgs boson.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know\nwhat that was because I\u2019m a biologist, but I\nstole it anyway as stealing traffic cones is so\nclich\u00e9. When I got home I forgot about it and\npassed out.\u201d\nIf the employees at Burger King realise what\nthey threw out with the trash (and that\u2019s a pretty\nbig if, we are talking about burger-flippers here\nafter all) they will no doubt attempt to claim\nthe Higgs boson as their own, although should\nthis occur it is likely that this lucky biologist\nwill invoke the law of shotgun, thereby nullifying any potential lawsuits placed against him.\nThe implications of this discovery are enor-mous: not only are we now one step closer to\nunderstanding the Universe, but all those annoying physicists who bet against its existence\nbecause the money would be a consolation\nprize will now be that little bit poorer, unable\nto afford pocket protectors for the next term.\nOur biologist is certainly going to be winning\nthis year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics, which he\u2019ll\nprobably spend on student essentials: paying\noff his loans and copious amounts of alcohol.\nGuy who walks out after half the time:\nHe puts his hand up and gives in the neatly\nstacked answer sheets.

He will also not fill in the\nfront cover of the extra paper he has until after the exam has finished. The minute it takes\nto fill out the front could be crucial. After the\nexam he runs home and looks up every answer,\nand tells everyone in a 5 mile radius that he\nthinks he missed a mark or two.\nGuy who uses 10 booklets:\nSitting up at the front, he writes an essay for\na 1 mark question. For a 3 mark question he\nwrites 2 essays and will later cross one out after deciding that it doesn\u2019t include every minute detail. He seems to take pride in the fact\nthat, while normal human beings are struggling to even put down one word, his alien\nbrain is spouting out thousands of poetic son-nets, even in a maths exam.

Come gaze in awe at\nour incredible roster of Imperial-based\nmusicians from Jazz n\u2019 Rock and Music\nTech, who will perform for you along\nwith our very special guest, Becoming\nReal.\nThe line-up for the night is an exciting\none, only rivaled by the line-up we had\nfor the original Felix Music Night.\nSpecial guest\nBECOMING REAL\n(Ghost-Step)\nAlongside James Blake and Mount\nKimbie, Becoming Real is defining\nthe landscape of post-dubstep British\nelectronic music, and we are extremely\nproud to have him perform at the Felix\nMusic Night. If you are looking for the\nfuture sound of London\u2019s nightlife, look\nno further than this brilliant artist. Do\nnot miss it! His unique live performance\nis unlike any other \u2018dance\u2019 artist you wil\nsee this side of Venus.\nPHRIJ\n(Jazz & Bass)\nBONED at Metric\nGreg Power declares open war on music haters,\nand invites you to the second Felix Music Night\nOPERATION MIDNIGHT CLIMAX\n(Progressive Ska)\nNICEBERG\n(Chipstep & Breaks)\nINESCAPABLE FATE\n(Death Metal)\nSMB\n(Deep House)\nBack due to popular demand:\nSIMON HUNTER, A.K.A. MONSK\n(Badman DJ set)\n... And you could play too!\nAre you in a band? Or are you an amateur beat poet? We are still looking for\none last act, so give us a shout if you\nwant to take part in BONED!\nWe have purposely incorporated many\neclectic musical styles in a single night,\nso as to appeal to as many tastes as pos-sible, but we assure you it all fits together just right. Each set will be kept short\nand sweet, and the set-up times in between acts will be minimal, giving you\na real bang for your buck.\nIt is to be a celebration of our local\nmusical scene and an opportunity to\nbond with other music-lovers, share a\ndrink and make new acquaintances. We\nwant this to be a cross-society bonanza\nof tasty vibes and sweet music.\nIf you have ever strolled into Imperial\nUnion on a Jazz n\u2019 Rock jam night,\nchances are you\u2019ve been paralyzed by\nthe sight of Inescapable Fate\u2019s members tearing shit up with an admirable\ndisregard for authorized decibel levels.\nInescapable Fate (IF) is Imperial\u2019s\nforemost death metal band, and they\nwill get the place they deserve in the\nlimelight at BONED, the second Felix\nMusic Night, taking place at Metric\non Saturday 11th June. We spoke to\nIF about their story and their perfor-mance.\nWho are you guys?\nIF: We\u2019re a four-piece outfit: Kiran\nplays drums, Sean takes bass and\nvocals and Laurie and Will play guitar.\nHow did IF get started?\nIF: Laurie and Sean first played together at a barbecue in 2006, covering \u2018For\nWhom The Bell Tolls\u2019. After that, Kiran\njoined them and Inescapable Fate was\nborn. After seeing the band live at a Jazz\nand Rock event, during which performance several fans were nearly ejected\nfrom dB\u2019s just for enjoying the show a\nbit too much, Will was invited to join\nthe band, and the lineup was complete.\nHow would you describe your music?\nIF: It\u2019s a good mix of thrash and death\nmetal \u2013 we try to keep it catchy enough\nthat everyone can enjoy it, whilst making sure that no-one can understand\nwhat Sean is saying.\nWhat are some of your influences?\nLaurie: There are too many to name,\nbut the likes of Carcass, Cave In, Entombed, At The Gates and The Smiths\nare as good as any.\nSean: For my bass playing it\u2019d be\nSteve Harris, Cliff Burton, Martin\nMendez and Marcus Miller. For vo-cals, I\u2019m a big fan of Tomas Lindberg,\nMikael Akerfeldt, Jeff Walker and\nRandy Blythe.\nWill: It\u2019s tough to say, since I\u2019ve listened\nto so much over the years. I like most\nthings \u2013 anything from Judas Priest and\nOzzy to Queen, or from Sting to Dream\nTheater or Opeth \u2013 it\u2019s all good. Most\nrecently however, I\u2019ve really gotten into\nthe \u201cdjent\u2019\u2019 movement: bands such as\nTesseracT and Monuments. It\u2019s basically what happens when you mix groove\nwith metal.\nWhy do you believe there\u2019s still a\nplace for metal in modern music?\nIF: Metal is an extremely adaptable\ngenre that combines aggression, melody\nand sheer volume with a cornucopia of\ndifferent (and sometimes unexpected)\ninfluences to produce rich and varied\nmusic with few boundaries. And everyone loves a good mosh.\nWhat is the best live performance\nyou\u2019ve ever seen?\nLaurie: Bolt Thrower at ULU in 2010.\nClassic West Midlands death metal. Bonus points for doing the \u201cdeath\u2019\u2019 voice\neven between songs.\nSean: Iron Maiden at Twickenham Stadium in 2008.\nWill: It\u2019s not all about how fast you can\nplay, but I do tend to enjoy the more\ntechnical gigs. I recently saw Symphony\nX play at Scala and it was phenomenal.\nTheir talent is difficult to replicate on a\ngood day, but they were playing above\ntempo and really working the crowd. It\nwas fantastic.\nWhy do you think people should\ncome see you play?\nIF: Because we\u2019re passionate about our\nmusic and aim to put on a loud, energet-ic, and entertaining live show that can\nbe enjoyed by metalheads and anyone\nwith an open mind towards music.\nNow all you have to do is come along\nand support Inescapable Fate as they\nrock the living crap out of BONED.\nMost importantly though, come and\nheadbang your heart out.\nInescapable Fate are bringing the noise to BONED... in a big way\nG reg Power\nSo that\u2019s 3 bands and 5 DJs: a total of\n8 incredible acts, playing all night long\nfor your listening pleasure, and all for a\nmere \u00a33. Seriously, what more can you\nask for?\nWe chose the date specifically because the vast majority of you will have\nfinished your exams, so there is no excuse for not turning up to a night of fun,\nkick-ass tunes and great performances.\nBring all your friends and their friends:\nthe event is open to everyone, not just\nfor Imperial students. This is the last\nshowcase of Imperial\u2019s musical talent\nthis year, and it is set to be a spectacle of\nepic proportions.\nCome one, come all, to BONED at Metric on Saturday 11th June 2011.\nA statement by Operation Midnight Climax:\nIn the 1950s, the CIA spiked\nunconsenting individuals with\nLSD in whorehouses across\nthe U.S. Now, we\u2019re not saying\nwe\u2019re going to drug you or violate your civil liberties. We will,\nhowever, blow your mind with\nthe sheer ecstasy of progressive ska music. Let midnight\ncome so our bodies may unite.\nLuke Tomlin\n\n"

Equipment costing more\nthan \u00a3121,000 is to be specially rationed\nacross the country with a special\ncommittee set up to assess proposals.\nThe alternative that researchers are\nexpected to take in order to cope with\nthis change will be to make greater use\nof shared equipment. This particularly\napplies to larger-scale kit such as\nhigher-resonance NMR machines (used\nby biochemists to acquire structural\ninformation about proteins) and\nsynchrotron X-ray beamlines (used by\nphysical chemists to acquire data on\nthe assembled structures of molecular\nsystems). In practice it is expected that\nincreased sharing will involve additional\ntravelling for many researchers, as well\nas decreased flexibility on which work\ncan be done when.\nThe Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC) is\nalone among funding councils in also\nimplementing the cuts for proposals\nsubmitted before the 1st of May, saying\nthat the \u201cscale of the reduction in capital\nfunding\u201d necessiates \u201cimmediate action.\u201d\nA College spokesperson was confident\nSamuel Furse\nIncreased equipment sharing\nencouraged\nthat Imperial would be able to manage\nany difficulties that arise due to the cuts.\n\u201cThe College is currently undertaking\nan audit of equipment to identify where\nthere may be opportunities to increase\nsharing of equipment across departments\nand campuses.\u201d The spokesperson added\nthat Imperial would continue to seek\nfunding from other sources: \u201cFuture\nresearch funding may mean looking\ntowards new sources of support, and the\nCollege is already quite entrepreneurial\nin this area, exploring opportunities\nin Europe and further afield, and with\ncorporate partners\u201d\nProf David McComb from the\nMaterials department told Nature\u2019s news\nblog that increased sharing of equipment\nwould not always be appropriate:\n\u201cFor example, if a project requires\naccess to X-ray diffraction or Raman\nspectroscopy facilities on a weekly or\neven daily basis, if these facilities are not\navailable in the principal investigator\u2019s\ninstitution how far is it reasonable to\nexpect the researcher to travel to conduct\nthe research?\u201d\nTheWakehamreviewisafiveyear-long\nprogramme (2011-2015) during which\ntime cost savings are made by changes to\nbudgeting for large equipment.\nChristopher Walmsley\n\u201cFunding for\nequipment costing\nabove \u00a310,000 will\nsee a 50% cut\u201d\nDecision awaited on\nMusharraf talk\nCollege seek advice from Metropolitan police\nThe College has denied permission for\na high-profile talk by former Pakistani\nPresident Pervez Musharraf on Sunday\n5th June, saying that they were not given enough notice. The talk, which may\ngo ahead on the following Sunday, was\norganised by the Pakistani Society and\nwas to focus on \u2018Unity, Faith and Discipline\u2019 and the role of young people in\npromoting peace.\nThe Union were informed of the visit\non Monday 30th of June and the College Secretary was notified the next\nday, less than a week before the event\nwas planned to begin. Pakistani Society\nPresident Hussain Ali said that the short\nnotice was due to the fact that they were\nonly able to recently confirm President\nMusharraf\u2019s visit. However, he did admit that they had been trying to book\nhim for a number of months, raising\nquestions about why they did not signal\nto the Union or College that they were\nattempting to book the former Pakistani\nPresident.\nThe College is currently awaiting\nfurther security advice from the Metropolitan police regarding President\nMusharraf\u2019s visit, and will make a decision about whether the talk could go\nahead on Sunday 12th June on the basis\nof that advice. A College spokesperson\nsaid, \u201cThe priority in hosting external\nspeakers is to ensure their safety and the\nsafety of others on campus.\u201d\nIt is not known as to whether there\nis a specific security threat but it is believed that there is concern that his visit could result in protests on campus. A\npublic appearance by President Musharraf in Birmingham last year was met\nwith protests, however a lecture given\nby him at Oxford Union in June 2010\npassed without any serious incident.\nPakistani Society President Hussain\nAli called the College\u2019s security concerns \u201cjustified\u201d and said that he was\nhappy that they were continuing to\nconsider his request. He said President\nMusharraf\u2019s visit would \u201cadd to the\nreputation of the College\u201d and urged the\nCollege to allow students the opportunity to \u201cinteract with and learn from one\nof the most influential personalities in\nthe world today.\u201d\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nHeather Jones said that she hoped that\nany security issues could be resolved\n\u201cas quickly as possible\u201d and that President Musharraf \u201cbe allowed to speak at\nImperial.\u201d\nKadhim Shubber\nThe visit would \u201cadd\nto the reputation of\nthe College\u201d say the\norganisers\n\n"

I saw some\nwith John Lennon\non YouTube the other day, in which he\nwasn\u2019t being a grinning media-trained\nrobot. He was joking about, with his\nstyle of surrealist humour, and generally being relaxed. If someone did that\nnow, there would be stories all over the\nplace saying they gave an \u2018erratic\u2019 in-terview. Watch several interviews and\nyou realise he was doing something that\nnowadays seems far too terrifying to us\n\u2013 he was being himself.\nAn interviewee being honest amazed\nme. I actually got a sense of what the\nman was like in real life, not a feeling\nI usually get when watching most in-terviews, with a few exceptions. I get a\nfeeling that the subject becomes a caricature of themselves.\nSo, have you ever watched a video\nof an interview? You have? Good, that\nwill make it all a bit easier. There\u2019s\nsomething you may have noticed when\nwatching; the interviewee rarely actually answers the question, unless it\u2019s an\nextremely irreverent question. If it\u2019s a\npolitician then you get the sense that the\nmere thought of giving a direct answer\nmakes them sweat harder than an Imperial head of Faculty hooked up to a lie\ndetector. So they waffle for a bit, until\nyou forget what the question even was.\nA politician\u2019s answer is a good name\nfor this phenomenon, as politicians\nmanage to do it with frightening ease.\nThat would be fine, but now everyone is\ngetting in on the act. It may have started\nwith politicians, but everyone seems to\nhave decided to start doing it.\nAs you know, politicians are so admired that others want to use their\nsecrets to gain some of their popular-ity. So from politicians to pop stars to\nfootballers, nobody is willing to give a\nuseful interview as they don\u2019t want to\nalienate anyone.\nI think the best way to describe this is\nwith an example. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recognise an exchange like this:\nInterviewer: What\u2019s your favourite\nband?\nInterviewee: Well, that\u2019s an interesting\nquestion. I really love music. I think it\u2019s\nhard to say exactly which band is my\nfavourite, as I have so many. I mean,\nwhat\u2019s really important is to remember\n\u2026(5 minutes later)\u2026 So as I said I have\na lot of bands that I like, and it\u2019s impossible to pick a favourite.\nInstead of what should have happened,\nwhich is this:\nInterviewer: What is your favourite\nband?\nInterviewee: The Beatles.\nAn actual answer to the question, and\na rather fantastic answer if you ask me.\nA big part of it is that people are\nafraid of offending someone, or saying\nsomething that someone doesn\u2019t like.\nFrankly, I\u2019m tired of it. It means that\ninterviews are just becoming pointless.\nThe interview should instead be written in big capital letters saying: THIS\nPERSON IS A VERY NICE MAN\nAND LOVES YOU ALL. PLEASE\nLIKE HIM.\nI\u2019m also blaming the media. They\ntake the approach that Silvio Berlusconi takes to women; they are ready to\npounce on anything, leading to everyone having some form of media coach-ing. This training seems to consist of: 1.\nGrinning like they are trying to win first\nGet an opinion\nplace in a \u2018grin like an irritating moron\u2019\ncontest and 2. Never actually giving any\nopinions, just generic words of praise\nfor everyone.\nThe people who conduct the interviews are also to blame, especially on\npolitical subjects. They have become so\nargumentative and angry that it\u2019s not a\nsurprise that people don\u2019t say anything\nof any merit. They know the second\nthey give an opinion they will be destroyed by the media.\nThat\u2019s politicians and the media, but\nthe blame can be spread even more.\nBack in the day people would disagree\nwith what others say. But no one would\nknow about it. Now, with the internet,\neveryone is a critic with a loud enough\nvoice to be heard, which people in the\nspotlight have interpreted as meaning\nthey can\u2019t say anything for fear of offending people. I think everyone needs\nto just remember that sometimes people\nsay stuff that they don\u2019t like, and that is\nnot the worst thing in the world. If you\ndon\u2019t like The Beatles that\u2019s fine \u2013 although I wonder how you managed to\nread this copy of Felix as you must have\nhad a lobotomy.\nWorrying about offending people makes celebrities bland\nTim Arbabzadah\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\ng\n\u201d\nEveryone needs to remember\nthat sometimes people say\nstuff that they don\u2019t like\nFELIX\nEveryone needs to take a leaf out of this guy\u2019s book\nImperial College London does not train its\nstudents to paint. It does not teach its students the philosophical differences between\nHegel and Nietzsche. In fact it doesn\u2019t teach\nanything except science, engineering, and\nmedicine \u2013 the Business School aside. These\nthings will not be revelations to any of you, we\nwould hope, but the reason for stating them\nso plainly is to demonstrate the perversity of\nthe following sentence. Imperial College London no longer supports the UK\u2019s most high-profile science lobby group, the Campaign for\nScience and Engineering (CaSE).\nOur institution, the only solely science-focussed university in the country, has decided that our affiliation with CaSE no longer \u201cadds value to the College\u2019s activities\u201d.\nWe think that this is nonsense and that\nImperial has a duty to support the science\ncommunity in the UK; a community in which\nCaSE is a influential and valued member.\nLet\u2019s first consider the cost of our affili-ation: \u00a33,000 according to some reports.\n(CaSE declined to confirm this figure but\nsaid, \u201cit wasn\u2019t far off.\u201d) Last year Imperial reported a surplus (or profit, in everyday terms)\nof \u00a341.3 million. It should be patently clear\nthat our subscription to CaSE was not breaking the bank. Imperial can easily afford it.\nBut we should not simply be wasting mon-ey, no matter how small the sum. Some kind\nof cost-benefit analysis is in order. So is it\nworth spending around \u00a33,000 per year\nto support CaSE. The lobbying and campaigning of CaSE arguably influenced two\nextremely important government decisions\nthis year. Research funding got off comparatively lightly during the government\u2019s round\nof spending cuts and important concessions\nto scientists were made in the government\u2019s\nimmigration strategy. The financial benefit\nto Imperial of these successes is difficult to\ncalculate, but the idea that in helping to protect Imperial from harsher government cuts\nthat CaSE has not added value to the College\u2019s activities is laughable.\nObviously Imperial will benefit from CaSE\u2019s\nlobbying efforts regardless of whether we\nsupport them financially or not. But CaSE\nincreasingly speaks for the community that\nImperial is supposed to be at the heart of.\nRead reports about the debate over science funding and it is obvious that Imran\nKhan, the Director of CaSE and an Imperial\nalumnus, is an extremely effective spokesperson for the science community. Imperial\u2019s decision suggests that we don\u2019t value\nCaSE\u2019s efforts; it suggests that we don\u2019t\nsupport its campaigns; and it suggests\nthat the most coherent and influential voice\nin support of scientific research in the UK\ndoesn\u2019t speak for Imperial College London.\nThis decision is frankly embarrassing and\nshould be reversed immediately.\nCaSE decision\nembarrasses Imperial\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n24\nLIFESTYLE\nLifestyle Editor: Richard Keller\nlifestyle.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 03 JUNE 2011\nLast week, whilst consuming a coffee\nand \u00e9clair, I had a debate with a friend\nabout string theory, gravity, and whether everything is made of particles or\nwaves. It was then that a rather charming French friend stopped for a brief\nchat. And, sure enough, we concluded\nthat French women are definitely made\nof waves (not that they don\u2019t have good\nparticles too).\nIt was at that moment that the topic of\nDominique Strauss-Kahn\u2019s alleged rape\non a New York chambermaid strung up.\nAnd it appears that amongst the quagmire of myriad rumours and juicy details that have engulfed the story, one\nthing stands out: France romanticises\nsexual predation.\nIn a country where caf\u00e9s and patis-series are found on every street corner,\nit is apparent that sex and politics go\ntogether like croissants and coffee. It\nis why many people had little problem\nwith the reputation of the married former IMF chief and presidential hopeful\nas a \u201cgreat seducer\u201d, entrenching many\na woman\u2019s gravitational field. France is\nsexy and proud of it \u2013 a country where\nflirting, seduction and sensuality add a\ncertain spice to the daily dose of joie de\nvivre.\nThe \u00e9clair that grates relativity\n100 minutes from LCY to ZRH\nRichard Keller on a relaxing sojourn in Zurich\nI\nwas in Zurich last week; a beautiful sunny day in what the Z\u00fcrcher\nlike to consider to be the best of\nSwitzerland, its peak. It lacks the\n15,203 ft altitude of the Dufourspitze, though, on a day like today the\nview across the lake is just as amazing.\nStrolling along Bahnhofstrasse the fashion statements (for women) walking by\npresent themselves mainly as wearing\nshorts or a mini skirt, leather boots that\ngo all the way up to the knees with flat\nheels and a top that has flowers printed\nall over it. In short, life is beautiful here.\nIt\u2019s refreshing to get out of London\nevery so often; there is an unmatched\npace to the city that is going to cost me\na few years of my life one day. Right\nnow I don\u2019t have to worry about that,\nI\u2019ve come here to delve into the well-liked societal appetite for coffee houses.\nOne thing to note about the city I\u2019m in\nis that it\u2019s probably the most un-wordly\nbanking-capital. There\u2019s only one week\nevery year, when the world\u2019s bottin\nmondain come to Zurich, the week before the Art Basel opens its doors. This\neating a pastry filled with liquid poo.\nThe problem with all those French\npatisseries that have started to conquer\nLondon \u2013 Paul, Ladur\u00e9e, Pierre Herm\u00e9\n\u2013 is that they are all overpriced, all incapable of producing a decent \u00e9clair. The\nA lifestyle capital on water. A little like London, just on a small scale!\nis the time when the best parties take\nplace. Rich people usually only visit\nZurich to see how their money is doing,\nthen fly home again the same day.\nSitting in a little caf\u00e9 in a side street\njust off Paradeplatz, the people in Zurich appear to be generally very happy.\nIt seems nobody is working today; everyone has become a member of the\n\u2018Caf\u00e9 Society\u2019. A perfect place to discuss business, art, politics and philoso-phy; and to gossip. There has been a\nrevival of the coffee houses again, after\nthey first flourished in the 17th\ncentury.A\nmeeting point for people of all classes,\nwhich has become the place of choice\nfor work, rest and play \u2013 somewhere inbetween home and office.\nWith free Wi-Fi this conveys the impression of an ideal location to get some\nwork done for the day. I can start typing on my laptop while sunk into an\narmchair and kindly ask the waiter to\nbring me a hot masala chai covered in\na thick layer of lovely frothed milk. It\u2019s\nlike working from home, with an endless\nsupply of Luxemburgerli, little cream\nfilled delights, to go with your tea.\nSpinning the globe you may find coffee houses to be a far cry from what\nyou expected. Don\u2019t hope to be served\nan Italian espresso in a Middle Eastern\nahwah, or a hot chocolate in a dutch\ncoffeeshop. What remains is the idea of\na place for people to gather and shape\ncommerce, literature, history and revolution alike.\nHours later, when it is still 28 degrees\nand all work is done, there\u2019s nothing\nbetter than to enjoy a freshly made ice\ncream. Acanto is not the gelateria at Piazza della Cisterna in San Gimignano,\nwhere you can enjoy licking your ama-rena cornetto under the Tuscan sun, but\nit\u2019s as close as you can get. Switzerland\nis not Italy, but there\u2019s always an Italian close by che fa buon gelato italia-no. Then it\u2019s back to business, I have a\nflight to London to catch in two hours.\ndifference between these patisseries and\nGreggs is that in the former you expect\nto find high standards of service and\nproduct, as well as originality, flair, and\nsophistication. But you don\u2019t.\nAnd then there is Dalloyau, located\nin Paris. Only two and a quarter hours\nfrom St Pancras, it\u2019s worth the trip because the French have kept the best for\nthemselves. Their \u00e9clairs are brilliant.\nJust brilliant. The chocolate crazily\nrich, the pastry delightfully light. As\nmy mind faded during my discussion\nwith my friend and turned towards the\nlacklusterness of my \u00e9clair, I could only\ngauge that Physics and its Theory of Everything doesn\u2019t have an answer to why\nso few things are absolutely the best in\ntheir class. Everything is supposed to be\nrelative. And yet my taste buds tell me\nthat the only \u00e9clairs that stand out, that\nare without question and unanimously\nthe best of their kind, are those from\nDalloyau.\nThis \u00e9clair is totally blowing my mind right now...\nDo you have no\nfriends and no\nstyle?

    "content": "FELIX\n14\nPoem for the week\nA R T S\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 03 june 2011\nHorses on the Camargue\nby Roy Campbell\nRoy Campbell was an\nAnglo-South African\npoet who lived from\n1901 to 1957. He was\ncalled the foremost\nAfrican poet of his\ngeneration and was\nknown for his outspoken condemnation of\nFreudianism and Marxism, both of which\nwere fashionable at\nthe time.\nWhen I eventually managed to walk through\nthe doors of the Olivier Theatre, blocked up\nwith crowds, I turned my head to the stage and\nthat enchanting stage setting took me to the beginning of the twentieth century straightaway.\nI could see a living room with wooden walls\ncosily enlightened with candles, and a grand\nbookcase and sofas. As a history lover, I realised that I picked the right play to watch on\nmy Bank Holiday weekend.\nIn 1904, the Russian dramatist and playwright Anton Chekov\u2019s \u2018The Cherry Orchard\u2019\nwas performed for the first time shortly before\nhis death. It was great to be able to watch this\nremarkable story with the main character, Madame Ranyevskaya, portrayed so ably by the\nwell-known actress Zo\u00eb Wanamaker CBE. I\nam sure you are all familiar with the cheerful face of Wanamaker from her famous roles,\nthink Madame Hooch in Harry Potter and the\ncontrol freak mother Susan Harper in the British sitcom My Family.\nSo, the plot of \u2018The Cherry Orchard\u2019 takes\nplace just before the Russian Revolution of\n1917. The story starts when Madame Ranyevskaya returns bankrupt back to Russia with her\ndaughter Anya, after spending ten extravagant\nyears abroad.\nShe is the landowner of a beautiful ancestral\nproperty includ a house and the large cherry\norchard in which the heroine grew up. However, as Ranyevskaya settles down to enjoy\nher nostalgic idyll, a merchant called Lopakhin, played by Conleth Hill, arrives to buy the\norchard from under her and trash the orchard\nwith new expensive holiday homes. Ranyevskaya, too engrossed in her heavenly home, ignores Lopakhin\u2019s evil scheme and fails to stop\nLophakin and other hostile forces from buying it and forcing her away from the beloved\nplace.\nYet again, another role brilliantly performed\nby Zo\u00eb Wanamaker. She is truly amazing in\nengaging with her role and you can see that\nshe feels every moment of the story, which\nbecomes very important in allowing the audience to experience the story as if they were\na part of it. The time period is mirrored very\nwell with the aid of enthralling costumes and\ndecorations. Despite the sadness of the story,\nthe play is not lacking in moments of laughter\nthroughout.

The theatre entrance was filled with anxious people when we\narrived and the air crackled with anticipation.\nInside we were greeted by music from the fifties whilst waiting for curtain-up. The simple\nscenery was just a single room: the recording\nstudio in which unfolded the legendary meeting of the four most renowned musicians of\nthe fifties; Jonny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl\nPerkins, and of course The King, Elvis. The\nstory was too bland for my taste as it was the\nreincarnation of a recording session that had\nhappened by chance in the Sun Studio, run by\nSamuel Phillips, the man who had \u201cdiscovered\u201d the four artists.\nThe storyline was insubstantial, just revolving around Philips\u2019 agenda of persuading the\nmusicians not to leave his studio, as they were\nindividually threatening to do.\nThe musical was very enjoyable in general\ndespite the story, as the musicians were phe-nomenal. Ben Goddard, who played Jerry Lee\nLewis, was an especially outstanding pianist\nand capable singer, and highly gifted in capturing the spirit of the young aspiring hillbilly boy\nLewis. The other actors gave solid performances although the least capturing character was\nElvis, played by Michael Malarki, who gave a\ngreat musical performance but sadly failed to\ncapture the iconic spirit of Elvis. On stage Elvis had a very distinctive way of moving and\nbehaving, a way that banned TV channels from\nshowing him from the waist down when broadcasting his concerts, and that made women go\nwild in his presence. Malarki did not show\nthis unbelievable charisma and stage presence,\nwhich for me is what Elvis was all about.\nAll in all the performance was amusing; worth\nseeing if you are a fan of music from the fifties.\nIt was dynamic, fast, fun and lightly digested.\nNoel Coward theatre, from \u00a310\nTaiba Suddek\nCatherine Ashmore\nHelen Maybanks\nNo Zo\u00eb Wanamaker, no more dancing!\nFast and fun, but this musical is a tad light on plot\n\u201cThe musical was\nenjoyable in general,\ndespite the story\u201d\n\n"

Even with the pitch\nslowing up, Headstone Manor managed to post a challenging\ntotal of 49, losing just the one wicket. In reply, Potters Bar\nstarted well, however 3 quick run outs left them reeling and\nleft the song \u2018Another One Bites The Dust\u2019 ringing in our\nears. Nevertheless, the lower order batswomen steadied the\nship and managed to guide their team to a rather nervy victory and thus achieved 3rd place overall in the tournament.\nAnd so, it was time for the final. The atmosphere was\ntense, with Wanstead choosing to bat first. Bessie opened\nthe bowling, and with Wanstead showing aggressive intent\nHamperial showed off some great fielding, stopping some\ncrucial boundaries. Lucy H bowled next, hoping to thwart\nthe batswoman with some slower balls. However, Wanstead\nseemed undeterred with some powerful strikes leaving the\nHamperial fielders helpless. A high edge off the last ball of\nthe over, offered Hamperial some hope, but alas it was too\nhigh for Vicky the WK-y. After 3 overs, the score was 40 for\nno loss, despite accurate bowling from Rebecca and a great\ndive by Lucy to almost stop a boundary. Jenny D started\nher over well with two dot balls, but Wanstead punished a\nsolitary loose short ball, pulling it to the boundary for six.\nDesperate to break the partnership, Jenny H bowled the\nlast over. However, there was no stopping Wanstead whose\nopeners seemed to be able to find the gaps all around the\nground, regardless of some attacking fielding by Bessie at\nbackward point. Finishing their innings with 62-0, Hamperial knew they had a match on their hands.\nJenny D and Jenny H opened the batting with great intent\n\u2013 smashing one four over midwicket and hitting a gorgeous\nstraight drive over the bowlers head. With 14 being scored\noff the first over, Hamperial were slightly ahead of the required run rate. Unfortunately, the next over proved to be\nour downfall. Wanstead\u2019s Melanie had a sensational catch\noff her own bowling, following this by bowling Hamperial\u2019s\nBecca for a golden duck! On her hat trick ball, the pressure\nwas too much and she gave away a wide \u2013 leaving Hamperial to\nbreathe a very long sigh of relief. Vicky, the new batswoman in,\nset about increasing the run rate with a powerful four over mid\nwicket and guiding the ball past the square leg umpire. Unfortunately, it was not to be, with Vicky being bowled for 13 runs\nand 27 needed off the last over. Hamperial ended with 47-3 off\nthe 5 overs, losing to worthy winners Wanstead, and finishing\n2nd overall.\nThe post-match ceremony was carried out in the spirit of the\nday \u2013 with fun and friendship. It was a truly fantastic day out,\nand the Imperial College Ladies aka Ice Cream Ladies were\nall welcomed with open arms.

    "content": "FELIX\n4\nNEWS\nFriday 03 june 2011\nT\nhere was a brief glimpse of a man\nslumped against a grey cell door on\nthe video link to Babar Ahmad\u2019s\nprison cell in a special unit at Long\nLartin maximum-security prison.\nHe observed as the trial took place below him\nfrom a discrete camera overlooking the jury\nbox. Britain\u2019s longest held detainee-without-charge cannot simply walk through the doors of\nSouthwark Crown Court, even though he\u2019s not\nthe one on trial.\nFour men sat in the dock last Tuesday 31st of\nMay, officers of an elite counter-terrorism police\nforce, the Territorial Support Group (TSG);\nPolice Constables Nigel Cowley, Roderick\nJames-Bowen, Mark Jones, and Detective\nConstable John Donohue.\nThey are held accused of committing assault\noccasioning actual bodily harm during the arrest\nof Babar Ahmad, a former Imperial student and\nstaffmember,onDecember2nd2003athishome\nin Tooting, South London. Babar Ahmad was\npreviously an engineering student at Imperial\nand working as an ICT support analyst for the\ncollege before he was arrested and detained\nunder the Terrorism Act. Although he was\nreleased without charge six days later, he was\nre-arrested the following year and continues to\nbe detained while fighting extradition to the US.\nTwo years ago, the Met police commissioner\nadmitted that he was subject to abuse during the\narrest and he received \u00a360,000 compensation,\nbut the officers involved now face charges. If\nfound guilty the maximum sentence they could\nreceive is five years imprisonment.\nFrom a hidden door, the jury were ushered\ninto the courtroom; the twelve people who\nwill decide the fate of these four men. Upon a\ndais, the judge overlooked the proceedings as\nthe barristers went to work in their wigs and\ngowns. A dozen people had gathered to watch\nfrom the public gallery. Babar Ahmad\u2019s father\nsat there, a small well-dressed man peering at\nthe proceedings from above his spectacles,\naccompanied by a young woman, his daughter.\nJonathan Laidlaw QC stood to present\nhis closing speech for the prosecution. He\nrecapped the injuries that Babar Ahmad had\nsustained in the arrest, described by forensic\nmedical examiners, and totalling more than 70\nphysical injuries. Reminding the jury that all\nof the officers denied landing a single blow, he\nexplained that there could be no middle ground;\neither the officers were truthful or they had lied\nto conceal an appalling assault. The officers\u2019\ndefence told the jury that Babar Ahmad had\nstruggled during the arrest and \u201cfought like a\ncaged tiger\u201d inflicting the injuries upon himself.\nBut the prosecution countered; none of the\nmedical examiners had identified any fighting\ninjuries on his hands. Laidlaw posed a question\nrhetorically to the jury: why might these officers\nhave been driven to attack Babar Ahmad? They\ncould have been frightened he speculated, or\ndecided to inflict their own form of punishment,\nor perhaps they had a racial motive.\nB\nabar Ahmad was formerly a\nstudent and staff member at\nImperial, working as an ICT\nsupport analyst in the Mechanical\nEngineering department. On\nDecember 2nd 2003, counter-terrorism police arrested him in a\npredawn raid at his home in Tooting,\nSouth London. During the arrest, he\nsustained 73 forensically recorded\ninjuries including bleeding in his ear\nand urine. He alleges that he was\nbeaten, choked, and subjected to\nreligious verbal abuse. Although\nthe IPCC initially refuted his claims,\nMet police commissioner, Sir Paul\nStephenson, admitted in 2009 that\nhe was submitted to \u201cgrave abuse\ntantamount to torture\u201d during the\narrest and he received compensation\ntotalling \u00a360,000. Four of the counter-terrorism officers involved in the arrest\nin 2003 now face criminal charges. If\nfound guilty of assault occasioning\nactual bodily harm the officers could\nreceive up to five years in prison.\nAt the time, Babar Ahmad\u2019s arrest\nwas the latest in the War on Terror\nand part of \u2018Operation Quarrier\u2019, in\nwhich three other men were arrested\nin Southwest London and detained\nunder the Terrorism Act. On the day\nof his arrest in 2003, Felix reported\n(pictured above) that a room in\ncollege was secured and searched\nby police with computers dismantled\nand removed for investigation.\nHe was released six days later\nwithout charge. However, he was\nre-arrested on August 6th 2004\nafter the US issued an extradition\nwarrant, accusing him of using\nwebsites and e-mail to raise funds to\nsupport terrorists in Afghanistan and\nChechnya. Legal wrangling over his\nextradition is still ongoing and has\npassed from UK courts, to the House\nof Lords, and now to the European\ncourt of human rights. Imperial\nCollege Union passed policy in 2004\nfully supporting Babar Ahmad in his\nfight against extradition. In March\n2007, former Union President,\nJohn Collins, wrote to then Home\nSecretary, John Reid, urging him to\nhalt extradition proceedings.\nBabar Ahmad is now the longest\ndetained prisoner in the UK without\ncharge, having been imprisoned for\nmore than six years \u2013 2493 days on\nthe day of print.\nThe story of\nBabar Ahmad\nUnbeknown to either Babar Ahmad or the\nTSG officers, MI5 had planted a bug in the\nhouse to monitor his activities, which recorded\nthe events of that December morning. The jury\nhas heard the recording and read mutually\nagreed transcripts from the bug. It may be the\nfirst time that MI5 surveillance material has\nbeen used in the prosecution of police officers.\nCumulatively, it has now taken more than 100\nhours in court to analyse the 12 minutes of\nrecording and the subsequent events that took\nplace during the arrest.\nIn a predawn raid, counter-terrorism police\ninvaded Babar Ahmad\u2019s house and arrested\nhim in his home at around 5am. Upon being\nconfronted in his bedroom, the prosecution said\nthat he raised his arms in surrender, but two of the\narresting officers said that he adopted a \u201cfighting\nstance\u201d. Testifying in court last month, Babar\nAhmad claimed he was victim to a \u201csustained\nand very violent assault\u201d in which he was beaten\nso badly that he thought he was going to die.\nAll of the defendants have denied mocking\nBabar Ahmad or his faith. Pc James Bowen\nhas told the court that the MI5 recording shows\nthat officers did not shout, \u201cWhere is your\nGod now?\u201d \u2013 an allegation that he described\nas a \u201cblack cloud over me personally and\nprofessionally.\u201d\nThree of Babar Ahmad\u2019s neighbours on\nFountain road witnessed him being taken by\nofficers from his house to a police van. None\nof them saw him struggle or shout, which the\nprosecutor told the jury contradicts the officers\u2019\nclaims that he struggled and shouted violently.\nThe first defendant\u2019s lawyer stood to address\nthe jury and asked them to \u201ctry to put yourself\nin Roderick James-Bowen\u2019s shoes \u2013 or should\nI say, boots\u201d and lifted up a single black police\nboot, slamming it down upon the stand for\nemphasis. \u201cThis was not the arrest of some\ncomputer geek for stealing IT weekly magazines\non Tooting High Street\u201d, he said, \u201cMr Ahmad\nwas not some nine stone weakling who\u2019s only\nexercise was the walk to the tube on his way\nto aeronautical engineering classes at Imperial\nCollege.\u201d The defence reminded the jury that\nhe was just months away from a black belt in\nkung fu at the time and that a samurai sword\nwas found in his bedroom.\nControversially, Babar Ahmad fought in the\nBosnian War of the early 1990s. The prosecution\nargued that he was a volunteer on a humanitarian\nmission, and was only recruited in the fighting\nwhen he could no longer stand to watch the\nkilling of Bosnian Muslims. However, the\ndefence described him as \u201can unpaid mercenary\nin someone else\u2019s war.\u201d The shrapnel wounds he\nsustained during the war \u201cwere not the kind of\ninjuries you get on Tooting High Street \u2013 even\nthe rougher parts.\u201d But testifying in court last\nmonth, Babar Ahmad refuted this interpretation\nsaying he was \u201cno Al-Qaeda Rambo.\u201d\nThe defence concluded: \u201cThis was not Wolfie\nSmith and the Tooting Liberation Front\u2026 This\nwas the real thing, as recognised by MI5 and\nanti-terrorist officers.\u201d\nIn the public gallery a woman leant forward\non her seat, watching the proceedings intently.\nJenny Nelson, a professor of physics at\nImperial, has followed Babar Ahmad\u2019s case\nsince it first began almost eight years ago. Her\nlate partner worked with him at Imperial, and\nshe, along with his former manager at Imperial,\nvisited Babar Ahmad in Long Lartin prison in\nApril last year. He is held there in a special\nunit for terror suspects where most inmates are\nfacing extradition. Reflecting on the meeting,\nshe said that he was entirely different from her\nexpectations of a man imprisoned for years, and\ncalled him an \u201cinspiring\u201d figure. She found him\n\u201cvery welcoming\u201d as they discussed his prison\nconditions, and his growing interest in other\nstruggles around the world.\nAt the time of writing, the jury were expected\nto have begun deliberations on Friday.\nBabar Ahmad assault trial\nBen Scally reports from Southwark Crown Court as jury hears\nclosing arguments in trial of counter-terrorism police officers\nBen Scally\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

With only the loss of 1 wicket, some quick\nsingles, and an economical over bowled by Priya\nPatel, Headstone Manor achieved a mediocre 39\noff their 5 overs. Becca and Jen, the two opening\nbatswomen for Hamperial, took 1 over to get their\neye in, not wanting to be over complacent. With\n3 fours and a single scored by Jen in the second\nover, Headstone Manor were left floundering.

Our reputation as a\nstrong batting side continued, with Amy scoring\na quick fire 33, including two sixes. It was only\nafterwards we found out that she was actually a\nhockey player!!! With Leanne being clean bowled,\nHamperial were determined not to falter, and Bessie joined Amy to steer us to a comfortable 65-2 off\n5 overs. Great overs were bowled by both Kiran\nand Kushani \u2013 each taking a wicket and Kushani\ntaking a great catch at deep mid-off, off Kiran\u2019s\nbowling.

A mean\nfirst over bowled by Kushani set the tone, and UCL\nstruggled to find the gaps in the field. With only\n23 on the board, a tight final over by Priya Shah\ngiving away just 2 runs restricted UCL to 25-1\nfrom their 5 overs. Hamperial, feeling confident\nthat the match should soon be in the bag, opened\nthe batting with experienced batswomen Kushani\nand Lucy H.

The only light\nin the room comes from my desk\nlamp as I burn the midnight oil,\nstooped over my desk. The floor\naround me is littered with scrumpled\nwads of paper. Discarded ideas. Each\none would have worked, they would\nhave worked fine. But fine isn\u2019t good\nenough \u2013 this has to be perfect. My girlfriend\u2019s birthday is coming up and everything must go just right.\nI\u2019ve been at this for fourteen hours\nnow. Maybe the alternative, to close my\neyes tight and hope everything works\nout alright is also an option. Perhaps\nthe best way is to be found in a happy\ncompromise, as a famous soldier of fortune often declared, \u201cI love it when a\nplan comes together.\u201d But I find it hard\nto agree with Mr Hannibal; by combining spontaneity with precision of fore-thought, I fear we risk losing the best\nparts of these different strategies.\nFor example, the first method of\nmeticulous planning is, admittedly, a\nlot of work. The best strategists lose\ncountless nights of sleep as they toss\nand turn worrying over the smallest de-Rory Fenton\nRhys Davies\nWhen conflict gives wisdom\n\u201cIf things\neventually go tits-up, people will\ninvariably come to\nyou for answers\u201d\nPlanning the unexpected\n\u201cHis war wasn\u2019t\nagainst those who\ntook his daughters\naway, but with\nhimself\u201d\npeople are less sure, things are generally safer. It is a delusion to think that,\nas long as we control enough of the vari-ables, we can control the outcome. To a\nlarge extent this is true, so long as we\u2019re\nnot working with atoms. Or anything\nmade of atoms. We may have a slight\nproblem.\nConversely, the issue with the hands-off approach is not one of control but\nresponsibility. You can\u2019t sit back and\nlet things happen by themselves if you\nweren\u2019t in a position to control things\nto begin with. You are still responsible\nfor the consequences. If things eventually go tits-up (which there is a strong\nprobability for them to do), people will\ninvariably come to you for answers. In\nthis scenario, it is wise to either have a)\na good explanation or b) a better escape\nplan. If you only ever plan one thing,\nmake sure it\u2019s this one \u2013 always have a\nget-out clause.\nMaybe I will just let things unfold...\njust so long as they do so at the French\nrestaurant on the corner between 7pm\nand five-past with flowers in hand.\nAh, I love it when a date comes\ntogether.\ntails. However, this effort and anxiety\nis rewarded when it comes off without\na hitch. The moment when everything\ncomes to fruition in perfect harmony\ncan only be compared to watching all\nthe gears, cogs and sprockets of a most\nmarvelous watch click into place for the\nfirst time. It\u2019s beautiful.\nThis euphoria is lost when you sit\nback and let things unfold around you.\nHowever, this method lacks the agonising hours of hard work and worry \u2013 a\ndecidedly stress-free experience. That\nin itself is a plus. Consequently, though\nit is not guaranteed, there is a small but\nreal chance that, without external inter-ference, everything will come together.\nIf a perfect plan realised is like a watch\nin perfect metre, then when things simply work is like watching as a million\nparts are thrown together at random \u2013\nyet produces a watch that reads the exact time. Certainly unexpected but not\nunwelcome.\nA problem with the planned approach\nis that it offers us the illusion of con-trol. The majority of motorway accidents occur during the day, when people\nthink they are in control. At night, when\nT\nwo years ago, on a January\nafternoon, an Israeli shell\nhit Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish\u2019s\nhome in Gaza, killing three\nof his daughters and his\nniece. Nothing can replace the hole left\nin his life by that shell. Yet the Harvard\neducated gynaecologist stood in front of\nthe Imperial College Israeli Society in\nMarch and proclaimed that \u201cgood deeds,\nwisdom and good works\u201d were the only\nweapons he wanted. His war wasn\u2019t\nagainst those who took his daughters\naway, but with himself. \u201cHate\u201d, he said,\n\u201chate was my greatest enemy. I knew I\nwould only drown in it; I had to look\nbeyond\u201d.\nThis was one of the most affecting\nand inspiring events I have ever attended at this college. The calm prose of this\nbereaved father confers a soft euthanasia on the anger of armchair Hamas\nsupporters, who too often dominate the\nIsrael-Palestine debate in this country.\n\u201cWe must understand the radicals, and\nshow them compassion. It is for each\nindividual to understand that justice for\nthem can only come from justice for the\nother side.\u201d\nAbuelaish\u2019s call for an abandonment of \u201clabels\u201d and an acceptance of\n\u201chuman, universal values\u201d resonates\nacross all conflict areas. How curious,\nand telling, that from apartheid South\nAfrica to Troubles-ridden Northern\nIreland, it is those who have lost the\nmost who refuse to return eye for eye.\nAbuelaish\u2019s daughter is blind in one eye\nand has had to learn to write with her\nleft hand, the right paralysed. But after\nseeing her struggle, and succeed, he has\ndetermined to provide scholarships for\nyoung girls, both Palestinian and Israeli,\nto complete their education. This Nobel\nPeace Prize nominee\u2019s story provides\nhope for those despairing that Gaza is\nstuck in a spiral of revenge.\nIn refusing to bow to ideology,\nAbuelaish stands for the revolution that\nisn\u2019t summed up in a slogan or fought\nwith guns, but humbly grounded in human experience and waged in the heart.\nHis belief that honest experience should\nbe placed before ideology stands in\nstark contrast to the suicide bomber or\nsoldier who values his own life and that\nof his victims less than some principle.\n\u201cThe most Holy thing in the world\u201d,\nAbuelaish told his audience, \u201cis human\nfreedom\u201d.\nAt the start of the Easter break, a\nCatholic police officer was killed by\ndissident republicans in my home country of Northern Ireland. In the past, an\nattack like this would be followed by\nrevenge attack after revenge attack. But\nthis Easter was different. Politicians\nfrom all parties attended the funeral. For\nsome, this was the first Catholic mass\nthey had ever attended. The parents of\nthe dead officer were unequivocal in\ntheir response; this death must be the\nlast.\nMercifully, none of us is ever likely to\nbe called upon to express quite the same\ndegree of forgiveness and compassion\nas Dr Abuelaish or the parents of PC\nKerr but the same spirit can inform the\nway we live our daily lives.\nFor two weeks from the 8th June, the\nChaplaincy will host an exhibition entitled \u201cForgiveness\u201d in Sherfield. Featuring photographs of people from conflict\nzones all over the world, from Northern\nIreland to South Africa, covering people\nof all religious faiths and none, the exhibition will be a powerful testimony\nto forgiveness. All are very welcome to\nattend.\nAlthough he is a devout Muslim, I\nhope Dr Abuelaish wouldn\u2019t mind my\nexpressing the core of his belief with a\nquote from the atheist and existentialist philosopher Albert Camus, discussing the search for an absolute ideology;\n\u201cWhat need had I of so many efforts?\nThe soft lines of these hills, and the\nhand of evening on this troubled heart,\nteach me much more\u201d.\nSo the news that our Cheryl\nhas been fired from American\nX-Factor has left us feeling\nsaddened and betrayed.\nSolution? Suck up:\nDear the America,\nPlease keep Cheryl Cole.\nPlease.\nUm, who?\nGood question, I\u2019m not entirely sure what she is famous for\nbut still she\u2019s cute and you\nlike accents and stuff, so\nkeep her in your X-Factor?\nHmm, we do like Scooby Doo\nand X Factor does seem to be\nlacking in that je ne sais quoi...\nIt ain\u2019t got nothing on your\nBritish shows, like the Made\nIn Chelsea and the Geordie\nShore. They are like California,\nonly sexier. Ok, we\u2019ll keep the\nCherry.\nCheryl. Actually since you\nmention Geordie Shore, she\nis in fact from Newcastle.\nWe love the castles. The British castles are awesome. Internets says she was in band\ncalled Girls Aloud. We have\nsomething similar \u2013 Pussycat\nDolls.

I have no hesitation in claiming\nthat it is by far their worst album to date, though that\nhas been said by most reviewers of every Belle &\nSebastian album since 1996. The album is distinctly\nless melancholy than their previous releases, and\nfeatures lyrics which at first seem vastly oversimple\n(\u201cWrite about love, it can be in any tense but it must\nmake sense\u201d rhymes just for the sake of it), but over\ntime the album starts to take its place in their musical history. Write About Love sounds like the emergence from a dark 14-year-long tunnel of musical\nexploration. B&S have sung about the complexities\nof love, life and everything in between, and now they\nare coming to a retrospective conclusion that life is\nprofoundly simple. This album, like Hemingway\u2019s The\nOld Man and the Sea, is an example of an intelligent\nartist using simplicity to great effect.

The opera itself was performed in Islington\nin January, but for those of us who weren\u2019t lucky\nenough to get tickets in time Ana\u00efs is playing a solo\ngig in Shepherd\u2019s Bush this weekend.

Foo Fighters\nwww.anaismitchell.com\nI\nhave been trying to pin down what is\ntruly appealing about festivals. What\nmakes them so hellishly fun and why do\nwe go to them? Of course there can\u2019t be\njust one answer. Part of the fun is getting away from \u2018civilisation\u2019 and going a bit\nmad for a few days; but after a while you can\u2019t\nhelp but begrudgingly admit that civilisation,\nwith its comfortable beds, warm showers, and\nclean clothes is actually pretty sweet. Obviously part of the fun is being with your mates; but\nit\u2019s probably not necessary to point out that we\ndon\u2019t just see our mates once a year at Bestival.\nWhat really makes a festival worth going to, in\nmy opinion, is the line-up. It\u2019s the opportunity\nto see a whole load of the bands that you love\none after another (as well as hopefully being\npleasantly surprised by those that you haven\u2019t\nheard of yet.)\nWhich is why a big smile came across my\nface when I saw the line-up for Field Day. It\nreads like a who\u2019s who of the alternative music\nscene in London. My eyes initially darted to\nthe names Jamie xx, James Blake, and Mount\nKimbie. But as well as the leading lights of the\nmovement that should or shouldn\u2019t be labelled\n\u2018post-dubstep\u2019, I also saw some of the better\nindie bands around today, like Wild Beasts,\nDucktails, and The Horrors.\nEven if that were all there was in one day, this\nwould be a festival worth going to. But then\nthrow into the mix Kieran Hebden (of Four Tet\nfame) going deck to deck with James Holden.\nAnd then Matthew Dear to get some funky\ngrooves flowing. On top of that, a personal\nfavourite of mine is also on the line-up: Star\nField of Dreams\nIf this was the NME, I would start this article\nwith a sentence like \u201cRodrigo Braga sounds\nlike the illegitimate lovechild of Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon backed by a Samba\nband,\u201d but it\u2019s not, so I won\u2019t. Rodrigo Braga\nis an excellent singer, guitarist and songwriter\nwho performs meaningful and intelligent music which, if approached from a genre perspec-tive, could plausibly be described as a fusion\nof American and Brazilian folk music. Now\nthat\u2019s proper music journalism.\nRodrigo\u2019s music is complex, sophisticated,\nsurprising and subtly jazz-influenced. On songs\nlike Drumbeatz (which can be found on Youtube), you can hear the professionalism and musicianship leaking through your speakers, while\nApollo 18, a song about rejection of modern\nculture, leaves the listener drenched in wit.\nAll this leaves me wondering why Braga is\nnot hundreds of times more popular than he is.\nAt a recent gig at Earl\u2019s Court\u2019s The Troubadour, he performed a show-stopping set of fantastic songs which would have had the entire\naudience dancing had they not got the entire\naudience thinking first. The distinctly mediocre pop-rock of Braga\u2019s support, Feldspar,\nonly highlighted how much of a gem he is\namongst a sea of dull musicians.\nBraga\u2019s debut, Between The Waves, is free\nto stream at www.rodrigobraga.co.uk\nKadhim Shubber continues the Felix Summer Festival\nGuide with a preview of East London\u2019s Field Day\nDates: 6th August 2011\nLocation: Victoria Park, London E3\nPrice: \u00a339.50\nWebsite: www.fielddayfestivals.com\nSlinger. Oh and also Factory Floor. Oh and\u2026\nOk I won\u2019t go on ad nauseam. But as well\nas the amazing line-up, if we roll back through\nthe reasons why festivals are fun, Field Day\u2019s\nformat actually makes it almost perfect. Since\nit\u2019s a one-day festival, in Victoria Park in East\nLondon, it\u2019s easy to get to. So actually you can\narrange to go to it with those mates that maybe\nyou don\u2019t see as much as you should \u2013 the tickets are reasonably priced at \u00a339.50. And while\nyou do get to get away from civilization and\nromp around a park for a day, at the end of it all\nyou can, if you want to, hop on a bus and sleep\nin a comfortable bed. A whole day packed with\namazing artists and I don\u2019t have to stand knee-deep in mud to brush my teeth in the morning;\nsounds perfect to me.\nThere are probably more user-friendly\neye patches out there...\nRodrigo Braga: Imperial\u2019s own Stevie Wonder\n\u201cYou can hear the\nprofessionalism and\nmusicianship leaking\nthrough your speakers\u201d\nNew Age fun with a vintage feel\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

All the direct\nfeedback has been positive, which\nmakes their departure all the more puzzling.\u201d\nAn Imperial spokesperson said that\nImperial regularly reviews its subscriptions to \u201censure they compliment\nand add value to the College\u2019s activities\u201d and that it was felt that the subscription fee could be \u201cbetter directed\nto support Imperial\u2019s core activities.\u201d\nImperial declined to say who had\nmade the decision or if there was anything specific about CaSE that Imperial was unhappy with, however the\nspokesperson did say that they continue to support the group\u2019s \u201caims and\nobjectives.\u201d\nThe Times Higher Education magazine has reported Imperial\u2019s subscription to be \u00a33,000, a sum that Mr Khan\ndeclined to confirm or deny, except to\nsay that it \u201cisn\u2019t far off.\u201d CaSE\u2019s membership fees range between \u00a31,000 and\n\u00a35,000 per year.\nImperial receives the most research\nfunding from public sources of any university in the UK except Oxford University, which it ties with.

Having signed\na Memorandum of Understanding in\nApril, thereby signifying their desire to\njoin with the current partners, Imperial\nand King\u2019s are now each contributing\n\u00a340 million to the project, matching the\namount from founding academic partner\nUniversity College London.\nWith a founding investment of \u00a3600\nmillion, the scheme has received\nsupport from Parliament in a recently\npublished report, but concerns have also\nbeen raised with regards to the location\nof the project.\nPublished on the 25th May, the\nCommons Science and Technology\nCommittee concluded an investigation\ninto the proposed location by praising\nthe \u201cstrong case for locating the institute\nclose to leading hospitals and academic\ninstitutions\u201d before considering that\nthere may be a \u201cpremium to be paid for\nlocating the institute in central London\u201d,\nciting higher costs and in particular the\nnotion that the location of the institute\nwill reinforce the concentration of life\nsciences in the \u201cgolden triangle\u201d in the\nsouth-east of England.\nThe Institute\u2019s response to the report\nhas, in turn, been largely positive.\n\u201cWe are pleased the MPs on the\nScience and Technology Committee\nhave described [the Francis Crick\nInstitute] as impressive and clearly\nin the public interest.

Ofcom\u2019s latest report would suggest that you head to\nyour nearest O2\nstore. The company came out on top\nin a study of major mobile providers in the UK, loading pages faster than any of 3, Vodafone, Orange\nor T-Mobile. The latter two, part of the \u2018Everything\nEverywhere\u2019 partnership, performed the worst in the\nstudy with speeds that were roughly half that of O2\n.\nThe research might not mean much in London how-ever, as it was carried out throughout the UK \u2013 even\n\u2018in the M62 corridor between Manchester and Liverpool\u2019, where it is safe to assume there are few Imperial students during term time. With smartphone\nuptake on the rise throughout the UK, O2\nmight just\nbe as \u2018better, connected\u2019 as they claim.\nSkype users might want to keep an eye out when installing updates on their system after users noticed\nthat the application was attempting to foist software\nfrom another company on them. Skype was found\nrequesting access to an application called \u2018easybitsgo.exe\u2019, produced by EasyBits, a company specialising in game apps. While not essentially malware, the\nsoftware was pushed to user computers without their\npermission. Skype then confirmed that the program\n\u2018neither installs nor un-installs correctly\u2019, a remarkable feat in this modern age. The update has been\ndisabled so there\u2019s no need to worry about picking it\nup now, but if you unquestioningly accepted a third-party update request on Windows over the past few\ndays you may want to double-check your system. A\nhelpful guide on locating and removing the software\ncan be found at http://bit.ly/m31XqC\nSkype pushes unwanted software\nto users\nWhile Android and iOS have become increasingly popular and must-have platforms, Samsung has an alternative to suggest: the Bada\necosystem. In June 2010, Bada-based Samsung Apps were launched in 118 countries,\nwith over a hundred million downloads and\nmore than 13,000 applications available by\nMarch 2011.\nBased on these facts, Dr. Manfred Bortenschlager, Engineering Manager of Samsung\nElectronics, noted in a lecture given at the\nDepartment of Computing on the 23th of May\nthat \u201cBada is one of the fastest growing eco-systems. It can be seen as a threat or as an opportunity that needs to be taken into account\u201d.\nThe vision behind Bada is a \u201cSmartphone\nfor Everyone\u201d; its main goal is to extend the\nsmartphone market by providing a lower-price\nsegment for smartphones. In other words, Bada\u2019s mission is not to compete with other existing smartphone platforms but turn Samsung\u2019s\nconventional customers into smartphone users\nby providing cost-effective smartphones.\nBada\u2019s feature-rich technical platform is\ncomposed of various services abstracted into\nfour layers to simplify things, starting from the\nkernel (or nucleus) in the lower level and finally reaching the framework layer which the\ndeveloper uses directly. Developers need not\nfully understand the lower levels, but can simply take advantage of the available services in\nthe framework layer.\nSpecifically, there is support for 3D graph-ics, multi-touch and various sensors, which\nshould enable you to create exciting and adventurous games.\nYou are also given direct access to external\nsocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the opportunity to enable commercial transactions in applications, such as\ntrading game items and selling music, so developers can provide free applications that are\nprofitable by internal sales.\nThe best place to get started with your development is the Bada Developer site. There you\ncan find anything you need to start developing\napps almost for free, including online lectures,\nsample code and useful blogs. A useful development guide is the \u2018Introduction to Bada\u2019\nbook, available to download free of charge on\ntheir website. It contains various recipes (code\nsegments) you can learn from and then extend\nif you wish.\nEveryone interested in application development is encouraged by Samsung to share their\nideas and implementation skills. As part of\ntheir \u2018Device Loan Program\u2019 if you are able to\nsell your app idea to them, they promise to provide you with a Bada device to develop it on.\nIn addition, the Bada Student Developer\nChallenge which kicks off in September 2011,\ngives you the chance to promote any cool app\nideas you might have, competing with the best\nstudent coders of 10 leading universities in a\n48-hour codeathon. All qualifying applications\nresulting from the competition will be awarded\nwith free promotion on the Samsung App Store\nplus a Bada phone.\nDr. Manfred also pointed out that everyone\nwho works on an application can make money\nfrom it by directly selling it, providing advertisements through it or by selling virtual goods\nusing it.\nThis is not only for money though; it will be\na unique experience that will look wonderful\non a CV and of course will give you fame if\nyou win!\nBada: make things happen!\nAre you IPv6\nready yet?\nOn 8th June the college will participate in the\n\u2018World IPv6 Day\u2019 event.\nThis is a twenty-four hour global test window organised by the Internet Society to assist\nwith preparation for the impending exhaustion\nof the world\u2019s available IP addresses \u2013 the network addresses used by computers and other\ndevices for communication over the internet.\nThe solution to the address problem is the\nIPv6 network protocol which will gradually\nreplace IP. On the day participants will create\nconditions that expose internet users to IPv6\non a larger scale than ever before. This will\nbe done by publishing IPv6 addresses for web\nservers alongside their existing IP addresses.\nAlong with the likes of Google, Facebook,\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nYahoo and many universities, Imperial will do\nthis for several of its websites.\nThe aim of the exercise is to reveal problems\nthat may occur as IPv6 is increasingly used in\nearnest, and also motivate internet infrastructure vendors to make their products \u2018future\nready\u2019. In the run-up to 8th June, Imperial ICT\nwill make relevant information available at:\nhttp://www.imperial.ac.uk/ict/ipv6day\nThere you can read about how you might\nbe affected on the day, the problems that may\noccur and how to make a very simple test in\nadvance to see if you are likely to encounter\nany issues.\nImperial College is\ntaking part in IPv6\n\u2018test-flight\u2019; make sure\nyou aren\u2019t left behind\nDevelop with Samsung to make those app ideas a reality\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 03 june 2011 25\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nS\no of course you\u2019re going to\nhave to take rifles.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nWe had gone to see Lorraine Craig, Chair of Imperial\u2019s Exploration Board, about our proposed expedition.\n\u201cRifles. There will be polar bears on\nSvalbard; they outnumber people. I\u2019ve\nhad them poke their heads into my tent\nonce or twice.\u201d\n\u201cAh, okay\u2026 yes we\u2019ll take rifles.\u201d\nAnd so began the process of turning\nthe thoughts that I had during the summer of 2010, into a year of planning and\npreparation. The aim was an expedition\nin the summer of 2011 to Svalbard in\nthe European High Arctic, an archipelago of large islands between 78\u00b0 and 81\u00b0\nNorth.\nNone of us are climbers or had any\nother particularly technical experience.\nWhat we can do is walk, and what better place to walk for long distances than\nover an ice cap. Imperial has seen three\nexpeditions to Greenland in the last 10\nyears, but the last time an Imperial expedition went to Svalbard was in 1960.\nOur plan was simple: walk for a long\ntime over Svalbard. The details (how,\nwhere and for what reason) were to be\nworried about later.\nOur team of six had the first team\nmeeting. Training started shortly after-wards, twice a week and then one weekend a month. The plan developed \u2013 we\nwould be hauling sledges each weighing about 90kg for 350km, aiming to\nsummit Svalbard\u2019s highest mountain\nTemperatures rarely dipped below zero\nand there was a worrying lack of snow.\nAfter hauling the sledges over a high\npass above Rannoch Moor, we gave up\nout attempts at skiing and hauling and\ndecided to set up a base camp and walk\nfrom there. This however required us to\nbe close to a pub for the coming New\nYear celebrations so after a 7km walk\nalong a frozen loch in the dark, the most\npathetic petrol fire ever made and a\nshort train journey, we settled down as\nthe only campers in Roy Bridge for the\nrest of the week.\nThe episode in Scotland convinced\nus that skiing wasn\u2019t a good idea and\nso we are now taking snow shoes and\ncrampons. The rest of the equipment and\nfood list was a mammoth task in itself to\npurchase and assemble and at the time of\nwriting most of the 400kg of it is sitting\nin a warehouse in Wandsworth, waiting\nto be shipped next week. 300kg of that\nis food, enough for each person to have\n4500 calories per day. The food list is extremely important as to have the energy\nto trek at temperatures averaging -15\u00b0C\nwe not only have to eat a lot, but have\nthe morale and desire to eat it. The main\nmeals consist of a carbohydrate with a\nsauce. Choosing the sauces involved\nan evening sitting round with about 15\npowdered bags of sauce \u2018tasting\u2019 them.\nMost were inedible and were ditched\nbut we have a cosy selection to give us a\nbit of variety. As well as main meals we\nhave powdered desserts, porridge and\nraisins for breakfast, and 1000 calories\nper person per day of snack food.\nThe main difficulty in planning an\nexpedition is trying to understand what\nit\u2019s going to be like when you get there.\nThe problem is that most expeditions\ngo where no one is really sure what it\nreally is like. The main settlements of\nSvalbard are well known and we were\nlucky enough to have met people who\nhave lived and worked there who have\nbeen extremely helpful. We have received a huge amount of help from the\nBritish Schools Exploring Society who\nare helping us ship the food and equipment and some brilliant advice from\ntheir Leader in Svalbard \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t go up\nthat glacier, it\u2019s 100% impassable\u201d (nuff\nsaid, we\u2019re avoiding that particular gla-cier). Most of all though, Imperial\u2019s Exploration Board have been crucial in not\nonly providing us with financial support\nand advice, but also for putting us in\ntouch with other funding bodies. I was\nrecently asked by the trustee of one trust\nif we\u2019d like to take his father\u2019s rifle with\nus to the Arctic as it had been used in the\n1930\u2019s to shoot seals.\nThe skills we needed to learn range\nfrom expedition first aid to crevasse rescue to shooting, all of which we\u2019ll hopefully never have to use. It may seem odd\nto prepare for a year for a month\u2019s travel\nbut the nearer it gets the more exciting\nit becomes. We leave on August 7 and\nbegin walking on August 10, returning\nto the Nordenskioldbreen glacier where\nwe started on September 10. Half of that\ntime will be in 24 hour daylight and nearly all of it over ice and snow. Most of the\ntime we will be 1000m above sea level\nand there are dangers from crevasses,\npolar bears, frostbite and fog that can last\nfor days are very real. If we reach our 80\u00b0\nnorth objective and carry on the 7km to\nthe northern tip of Spitsbergen there will\nbe no more land until the North Pole. But\nafter a year I know we\u2019re ready.\nSo all in all I\u2019m not too worried about\nthe polar bears. Two rifles, a flare gun\nand four trip wires should be enough.\nAll the preparation means we can concentrate on appreciating the spectacular\nplace we are going to. Jagged mountains covered in ice and snow stretching\ninto the distance; an ice cap hundreds of\nmetres thick that will be our home; the\nsun in one long set and rise, never quite\ntouching the horizon until late August;\nand the feeling of being in the wild.\nWe\u2019re taking \u201cenough\n[food] for each\nperson to have 4500\ncalories per day\u201d\nFrom left: Alex Kendall, Andrew Elliott, Nathaniel Bottrell, Sietse\nBraakman, and Heather Jones. 6th member Alistair Cott is not pictured\nNewtontoppen (1717m) and reaching\nthe 80\u00b0 north line of latitude, which just\ntouches the tip of the main island, Spitsbergen.\nAt the end of the Autumn term, over\nNew Year\u2019s, we all went to Scotland,\ncamping for a week to practise being\ncold and hauling sledges. Unfortunately\nfor us it must have been the warmest\nwinter Scotland has had for a while.\nRIFLES, POLAR\nBEARS, AND\nSUB-ZERO\nTEMPERATURES\nALE X KENDALL REPORTS ON\nPREPARATIONS FOR SUMMER\nEXPEDITION TO SVALBARD\n\n"

This\nnew understanding of how heroin works\ncould have a profound effect on how we\ngo about managing heroin addiction.\nHow heroin works has always been\na mystery. It is one of the most addictive drugs we know and yet when tested\non brain cells directly it has very little effect. Previously, scientists have\nsuggested that heroin was transported\nto the brain and then metabolised into\nmorphine, meaning that heroin addiction was therefore a form of morphine\naddiction. However, using pharmacoki-netic modelling this new research has\nfound that, once injected, heroin is converted rapidly to 6-MAM in the blood.\nThis means that very little heroin actually reaches the brain as it is metabo-lised too quickly. 6-MAM is then able\nto cross the blood-brain barrier where it\ncan bind to \u00b5-opoid receptors creating\nthe rush. Some of the 6-MAM is further\nconverted to morphine. However, this\nonly gives a supplementary effect.\nThe team is now trying to verify that\nthe conversion of heroin in humans is\nas quick and extensive as in mice, and\nwhether the metabolism is the same\nthrough different ways of administering\nheroin \u2013 intravenous versus smoking,\nfor example. This research could lead to\na new method of treating heroin addic-tion. Vaccines against heroin previously\nfailed because it was metabolised in the\nblood too quickly.
