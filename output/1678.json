With 1300\ncompetitors in the race\nthe starting funnel was\npacked, but chip timing\nallowed some runners to\ntactically start nearer the\nback to give themselves\nthe psychological boost of\novertaking people during\ntheir race.\nThe race was set\nunderway promptly at\n9:30 and they were off!\nCrowds of spectators\nlined the first few hundred\nmetres but the sounds of\ncheering and support soon\ngave way to the rumble of\nracing feet pounding the\nBrighton roads and rush\nof heavy breathing. The\ncourse was simple \u2013 3km\nout along the road beside\nthe promenade before\nreturning along the same\n3km straight and continuing 2km past the start/\nfinish before a final 180\ndegree turn (\u03c0 radians\nif you must) and a 2km\nsurge to the finish line.\nThe ideal race conditions\nthat greeted the runners\nwere a far cry from the\n2016 edition which saw\nthe race cancelled just\nhours before the scheduled start time due to\nthe high winds of Storm\nAngus. Clear blue skies\nwatched over this year\u2019s\nevent for the duration, yet\nthe shining sun offered\nlittle warmth. Fortunately,\nthe exothermic nature of\nrespiration in the mitochondria of the athletes\u2019\ncells soon warmed them\nup and spurred them on.\nBeing along the seafront,\nthere was an inevitable\nbreeze on the course. Nevertheless, with Imperial\u2019s\nathletes tactically forming\ngroups to ease the stretch\ninto the wind this had a\nnegligible impact on their\nperformance.\nICXCAC also provided\nmuch entertainment\nfor the locals with the\ncommentator at the finish\nat one point remarking:\n\u201cAnother Imperial\nrunner!

A few\nbrave members opted for\nsome shallow paddling,\nand two madmen decided\nthey quite fancied a (very\nbrief) swim in the refreshing (i.e. ice-cold) waters.\nFinally, to end the\nday the weary athletes\nreturned to where their\nvisit to Brighton began\nand toasted the absence of\nISCM Light Opera before\nthe train journey back to\nthe capital.\nFor more information\nabout the club, email\nrun@ic.ac.uk.\nImperial\u2019s sub-37 men were all smiles after the race // ICXCAC\nSarah Johnson collects an assortment of prizes for 2nd\nLady // ICXCAC\n\u201c\u2018Another\nImperial\nrunner!

Mudbound\nhowever, is a reminder\nof what we all share \u2013 the\nhuman struggle to take\ncontrol of our lives and\nmake something out of\nour brief existence on this\nearth. Mudbound lets this\nstruggle play out against\na backdrop of rural 1940s\nMississippi. Two families,\none black and one white,\noccupy the same piece of\nfarmland, but in vastly\ndifferent capacities. The\nwhite family, led by the\ngruff, straight-talking\nHenry McAllan (Jason\nClarke) are the beneficiaries of racial privilege\nin the Jim Crow South\nand the owners of the\nfarm. The black family,\nheaded by a guarded\nand long-suffering Hap\nJackson (Rob Morgan)\nare tenant farmers who,\nfor decades, have been\nbound to this land. The\nJacksons have worked\nthis land for generations,\nfirst as slaves in the antebellum South and later\nas sharecroppers, subservient to whichever white\nlandlord held ownership\nover this modest patch of\nmud-soaked farmland in\nthe Mississippi Delta.\nIn Mudbound, while\nno two scenes are the\nsame, the one constant\nthroughout the film is the\npresence of mud. That\ngrimy, sticky substance\nthat purges purity with\npollution and turns fertile\nground into a barren\nwasteland from which\nnothing good can grow.\nHere, land is a symbol of\nrelentless hardship and\ninescapable struggle. It\nis a burden, always on\nthe verge of becoming\nwaterlogged and taking\nits servants down with it.\nHap works the land not\nbecause he wants to, but\nbecause he dreams of one\n\u201cMudbound\nhowever, is\na reminder\nof what we\nall share -the human\nstruggle to\ntake control of\nour lives\u201d\n\u201cIn Mudbound,\nwhile no two\nscenes are\nthe same, the\none constant\nthroughout\nthe film is the\npresence of\nmud\u201d\nday being able to afford a\npatch of land that he can\ncall his own. He works\nthe land day and night,\nbreaking it and sowing it;\nhoeing it and caring for\nit; tossing the soil till his\npalms swell; and ploughing the earth till his back\nbreaks. His only reprieve\ncomes in the form of his\nweekly Sunday church\nservice where he can\nmaintain the hope that one\nday, he and his family may\nbreak free of this timeless\nstruggle. As he preaches\nto the other sharecroppers\non the farm, Hap lifts a\nsermon into a hymn and\ndelivers the message that\n\u201cone morning, we gon\u2019\nbreak this boot from\n\u2018round our neck and shake\nthese chains from \u2018rounds\nour feets\u201d. The central\nquestion of Mudbound is\nwhether that dream can\nbecome a reality.\nOn the other side of\nthe farm, Henry; his wife\nLaura (Carey Mulligan);\nand Henry\u2019s father, Pappy\n(Jonathan Banks) live in\na derelict cabin without\nany electricity or running\nwater. Laura, tenderly portrayed by Ms. Mulligan, is\nintroduced as an unhappy\n31 year-old woman, still\nliving with her parents,\nwho quickly agrees to\nmarry the plain-speaking\nand uncomplicated Henry\non the insistence of her\nmother. The social climate\nof the era demands that\nLaura remain subservient\nto her husband, and\nindeed she does so, gladly,\nuntil she meets Henry\u2019s\nyounger brother, Jamie\n(Garrett Hedlund). Jaime\nis undoubtedly the most\ncharismatic character of\nthe film\u2019s ensemble, and\nhis magnetic personality\nand relaxed confidence\ndo more to evoke the\nimage of James Bond than\nthat of a grounded 20th\ncentury farmhand. It\u2019s not\nlong before Laura falls for\nJamie, but their simmering\nromance is quickly put to\nan end when Jamie ships\noff to the military, bound\nfor Europe and the war.\nOver at the Jacksons\u2019,\nHap\u2019s eldest son, Ronsel\n(Jason Mitchell), mirrors\nJamie\u2019s choice and also\nheads off to the war.\nThe choice to juxtapose\nthe experiences of black\nand white Americans,\nboth abroad on the\nbattlefields of Europe\nand at home in heart\nof Mississippi, allows\nMudbound to explore the\nsegregationist politics\nof the Jim Crow era in a\nway few other films have\nmanaged. In Europe,\nRonsel and his all-black\n761st Tank Battalion\nare viewed as liberators.\nWhenever they roll into\na beleaguered village or a\nbesieged town, the locals\ngreet them with rapturous applause and tears\nof joy. Racial prejudice\nand injustice are noticeably absent, and all that\nremains is the immense\nexpression of gratitude\nfrom one community of\npeople to another.\nBack in Mississippi\nhowever, Ronsel is\nreminded of his sec-ond-class status within\nAmerican society. Every\ntime he wants to use the\nwashroom or ride the bus,\nsignboards with the word\n\u201ccoloured\u201d remind him of\nthe institutionally-man-dated divide between\nblacks and whites in the\ncountry he calls home.\nMudbound is set in the beautiful Memphis, Tennessee in 1939 // Sundance Film Festival\nFILM\nMark Aduol\nFilm Editor\nDir: Dee Rees. Script: Dee\nRees, Virgil Williams. Story\nby: Hillary Jordan Starring:\nCarey Mulligan, Jason\nClarke, Jason Mitchell,\nMary J. Blige. 134 minutes\nMUDBOUND\nand women to toil day\nand night on that mud-swamped farmland.\nDuring one of these\nmonologues, Florence\nJackson (Mary J. Blige),\nRonsel\u2019s mother, intones\nthat her son \u201ccan\u2019t sit\nstill, can\u2019t move\u201d. He is\ntrapped in between two\nworlds: the blood-soaked\nbattlefields where he was\npraised as a saviour and\nthe mud-soaked farmland\nwhere he must stay and\nwork, out of a sense of\nduty to his family. The\nonly other person who\ntruly understands this\ninner battle is Jamie,\nand over the latter half\nof the film, the two end\nup finding some sense of\ncomfort in sharing their\nwartime experiences with\none another.\nA veteran fighter pilot,\nJamie is haunted by a\nparticularly harrowing\nwartime experience\nthat has left him with a\ndamaging case of PTSD.\nWhiskey is his medicine\nand Ronsel is his partner\nin crime. Barely a scene\ngoes by where Jamie is\nnot halfway through a\nbottle of alcohol, but even\ndespite his seemingly\ncarefree attitude, he never\nforgets that his friendship\nwith Ronsel rests on\nshaky ground. The Ku\nKlux Klan was well and\nalive in 1940s Mississippi\nand were intent on advancing their supremacist\nideology by using any\nmeans necessary.\nMudbound is a film\nthat manages to be both\nintimate and expansive. A\nstory that orbits around the\nMississippi Delta, but also\ndrifts into the far reaches\nof Western Europe. Even\nthough the lives of the\ntwo families play out on\na single stage of mud-swamped farmland, they\noverlap in more ways than\none. Whereas the older\nfolks are eager to preserve\nthe culture of casual\nprejudice and inherited\nprivilege, the younger\nones are desperate to\nintersect along the lines\nof a rapidly changing\nsocial climate, and in\ndoing so, she crafts a bold\nand intimate work that\nresonates well beyond its\nhistorical period.\nMudbound is a piece\nof poetry that explores\nthe contours of racial\nprivilege and prejudice\nin a delicate and nuanced\nmanner. It is a film of\ntender introspection\namplified with occasional\nmoments of action. The\nfilm is told from the perspective of six characters,\nand come Oscar season,\nit will be someone\u2019s job\nto separate the lead ones\nfrom the supporting ones.\nFor now, it is safe to say\nthat with Mudbound,\nRees has taken the most\nmundane of circumstanc-es, and crafted a sweeping\nepic that plays out like an\nintricate character study.\nThat alone is enough to\nwarrant your respect.\nMudbound is currently\non Netflix and is available\nat Curzon cinemas.\nOne of the most striking promotional images of this year, easily mistakable for an oil painting // Sundance Film Festival\nThe naked reality of such\nracial prejudice is perfectly captured when Ronsel,\nhaving just returned home\nfrom the war, casually\nattempts to leave a\nshopping store through\nthe front door. He doesn\u2019t\nget far before Pappy, the\nMcAllan family\u2019s other\npatriarch, sternly reminds\nhim that \u201cyou\u2019re in Mississippi now ni**er, you\nuse the back door.\u201d\nMudbound is adapted\nfrom Hillary Jordan\u2019s\nnovel of the same name,\nand at several moments\nthroughout the film, Dee\nRees substitutes dialogue\nfor inner monologues\ndrawn directly from\nJordan\u2019s source material.\nMonologues that puncture\nthe characters\u2019mud-baked\nexteriors and give us a\nglimpse into the truths,\ndrives, loves, and fears\nthat push these men\n\u201cMonologues\nthat puncture\nthe characters\u2019\nmud-baked\nexteriors\nand give us a\nglimpse into\nthe truths,\ndrives, loves\nand fears\u201d\n\u201cMudbound\nis a piece of\npoetry that\nexplores the\ncontours of\nracial privilege\nand prejudice\nin a nuanced\nmanner\u201d\nforge a path of their own\nand escape a future of\nearth-bound subservience.\nDee Rees traces the lives\nof these characters as they\n\n"

It\u2019s unprecedented.\nI could lie, and say that\nthis is because I\u2019m being\nsuper organised, but you\nand I both know that\u2019s\nnot the case. What really\nhappened was that last\nnight Felix did ACC, and\nI am now too hungover\nto write anything other\nthan a sentimental\nbarrage of my thoughts\nand #feelings. This was\nmy first ACC night since\ncoming to Imperial, more\nthan five years ago, a fact\nthat shocked many of\nthe editorial team. I was\nalways under the impression that it was like sports\nnight on steroids, and that\nanyone who wasn\u2019t on\nthe football team would\nget forced to down pints\nby pituitary cases painted\nblue. Was this the case?\nMaybe. Who knows. I\nreally can\u2019t remember that\nmuch, other than attempting to do a strawpedo and\nbeing hit with that barrage\nof warm, sweaty air you\nencounter when you first\nenter Metric. I also have\na distinct recollection of\nsomeone asking me what\nsports team I was on; I\nthink I said \u2018yoga\u2019.\nBut after a few hours\nof incredibly poor quality\nsleep, I\u2019m back in the\noffice, trying to get this\nweek\u2019s paper to print. As\nI write this, NHS England\nhave just announced that\nthe Royal Brompton\nHospital will be keeping\nits congenital heart disease\nservices open \u2013 long-ges-tating proposals relating\nto quality of care for cardiology patients would have\nled to the services being\nscrapped, which would\nhave had a knock-on\neffect on their other units.\nThe Royal Brompton is a\nworld-famous centre for\nrespiratory medicine and\ncardiology, and closure\nof these units would have\nmade this a thing of the\npast.\nAt Imperial, people are\noften accused of being\napolitical. We\u2019re told that\nwe don\u2019t care enough\nabout the world around\nus, that we\u2019re too busy\nfocussing on lab reports\nand SCR breakfasts\nto get upset about rent\nstrikes or living wage\ncampaigns. But while it\u2019s\ntrue that most people here\nare working very hard,\ndevelopments around the\nRoyal Brompton highlight\nwhy it\u2019s so important for\nus to stay tuned in to\nwhat\u2019s going on. Science\nisn\u2019t divorced from the\nworld \u2013 it\u2019s a field that is\nintensely political, hugely\ncontingent on decisions\nmade in Westminster and\nbeyond. Lack of funding\nfor the NHS will have\na knock-on impact on\nthe amount of research\nbeing done; Brexit has\nalready led to academics\nleaving Imperial for less\nEurosceptic shores; and\nwhat you\u2019re supposed to\nbe learning in that aero\nlecture you\u2019re not paying\nattention to could have a\nreal impact on the world\nin the future.\nSo we should all engage\nwith the political sphere,\nand this starts with edu-cation: find out about the\nissues that will affect you;\nlearn the names of your\nlocal councillors; head\nalong to some meetings.\nScience has got to be\npolitical \u2013 it can\u2019t afford\nnot to be.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nListen to the Felix Podcast!\nFelix have teamed up with IC Radio to\npresent the Felix Podcast!\nEach week Rob Garside will be interviewing\nthe team all about how Felix is made, and\nthe stories we publish each week.\nListen at the IC Radio Mixcloud:\nwww.mixcloud.com/ICRadioPodcasts\n\n"

Chop the carrot, garlic, yellow onion,\nshiitake mushrooms, and green onion as\nfinely as possible. A food processor can be\nused to save time.\n2. Mix the chopped ingredients, along\nwith the light soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt\nand white pepper, with the minced pork in\na mixing bowl.\n3. Form a meatball the size of a 1p coin\nand place it on the wonton skin. Wet your\nfingers with some cold water to help seal\nthe wonton skin during the folding pro-cess. Ensure that the skin is not torn while\nfolding. There are several ways to fold the\nwonton skin which are:\n\u2022 Fold one corner to another corner of the\nwonton skin diagonally to form a triangular shaped wonton dumpling.\n\u2022 Fold one corner to another diagonal corner,\nthen pull the bottom corners towards each\nother and away from the first vertex to form\na Chinese gold ingot shaped dumpling.\n\u2022 Pinch all four corners together to the middle to form a pouch shaped dumpling.\n4. The dumplings can be either deep-fried\nwith vegetable oil until the skin is golden brown, boiled into a soup for about 6\nminutes, or steamed for about 15 minutes.\nServe with sweet chilli dipping sauce.\nF\nelix Food has\nbeen sharing\nsimple and quick\nrecipes for the\npast few issues, and that\u2019s\ngreat!

Shake Shack\nAnother American food giant trying to take over the UK? Well this time it better be good! Felix is sending its best\ncritique to see whether it\u2019s really worth it.\nFOOD\nBl\u00e1ith\u00edn Dockery\nFood writer\nW\nhen you\nthink of\nthe United\nS t a t e s\nof America what do\nyou imagine? Towering\nskyscrapers? Sunny\nBeaches? Famous faces?\nHow about a good ol\u2019\nAmerican cheeseburger?\nThe burger is an iconic\nAmerican food, even\nrecently honoured in\nthe movie The Founder\ntelling the story of how\nMcDonald\u2019s came to be.\nBut don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t\nbe reviewing McDonald\u2019s\ntoday (that hype is way\nout of my league), instead\nI\u2019ll be taking a look at a\nmore recent import: Shake\nShack.\nIn the US, where the\nburger reigns supreme,\ncreating a new burger\nbrand which captures the\npublic\u2019s attention is no\neasy feat. However that\nis exactly what Shake\nShack has done. Since\nits founding in 2004 it\nhas been one of the fast-est-growing food chains,\namassing 136 locations as\nof October 2017. Shake\nShack has all the makings\nof a classic fast food\noutlet: a relatively simple\nmenu, including the essential burgers and fries,\nand food served exceptionally quickly. However\nin comparison to the\nmore long-standing fast\nfood chains, Shake Shack\ndelivers up a quality meal,\nwith fresher ingredients\nfrom \u201clike-minded arti-sanal producers\u201d (yes this\nis actually a quote from\ntheir website).\nIn 2013 Shake Shack\nopened its first London\nlocation in Covent\nGarden, and has maintained a steady hype\naround its brand, allowing\nfor a further three locations to open in the city\nand four more in the UK.\nAs the favourite burger of\nthe east coast of the US I\nbegan to wonder: is Shake\nShack really worth the\nhype?\nFirst impressions\nTo get the most authentic experience I visited\nthe original London\nlocation: Covent Garden.\nCovent Garden itself has\na palpable buzz, off which\nShake Shack was cleverly\nfeeding. The main seating\narea is centred in the\nmiddle of the vibrant\nmarket building piazza\nwhile the food is ordered\nand prepared inside\nthe building opposite.\nThe ordering room was\nsmartly decorated with\na simple colour scheme,\nincluding dark blues and\nthe bright dark green of\nthe Shake Shack logo.\nThe menu itself was\nquite straightforward\nand focused on burgers\nand hot dogs. To get the\nfull experience I ordered\na selection, including a\n\u201cIn the US,\nwhere the\nburger reigns\nsupreme,\ncreating a new\nburger brand\nwhich captures\nthe public\u2019s\nattention is no\neasy feat\u201d\n\u201cThe taste\nwas a mix of\nthe squidgy\nslightly sweet\nbun, the melty\ncheesy and\nthe thin meaty\npatty\u201d\nShackBurger, the famous\n\u2018Shroom Burger\u2019 (raved\nabout by all the vegetarians I know), and crin-kle-cut fries. After placing\nour order we were given\na little buzzer \u2013 I imagine\nthis was to build the anticipation for our food. To be\nfair it did work: when the\nbuzzer rang a few minutes\nlater I practically leapt up\nfrom my chair and rushed\nto the food widow where\nI was given a sturdy\nsteel tray laden with the\nsteaming vibrant food.\nThe smell of the fries and\nburgers had me practically drooling but the key\nquestion remained: how\nwould it taste?\nThe food\nI decided to start with\nthe classic ShackBurger: a\ncheeseburger with lettuce,\ntomato, and ShackSauce.\nTaking my first bite, I\nwas not disappointed.\nThe taste was a mix of\nthe squidgy slightly sweet\nbun, the melty cheesy,\nand the thin meaty patty.\nIt certainly tasted like a\nburger, but was a huge step\nup from the classic fast-food chains. The burger\npatty actually tasted of\nproper meat and had a\nslightly crunchy outside,\nwith a nice texture which\nbalanced the super soft\nbun. However, before I\nfelt I had even started I\nhad finished. The burger\nis quite small, especially\ncompared to other burger\nrestaurants which have\nmuch larger meat patties\nmaking the burgers feel\nlike a proper meal. But\nnot to worry \u2013 I had plenty\nmore to get through.\nAs a \u2018palate cleanser\u2019\nI decided to go for the\ncrinkle-cut fries. The\ncrinkle-cut is certainly\na novelty, and gives the\nfries an extra crispy coat.\nThey were exceptionally\ngood, perfectly crisp and\nsoft in the middle, with\nthe right balance of salt.\nNow for the \u2018Shroom\nBurger.\u2019 This was\nprobably the one item I\nwas most excited for, as\nI had never seen a vegetarian burger like this.\nThe burger is made from\na portobello mushroom\nstuffed with oozing melty\ncheese and fried. My god\ndid it look good. My first\nbite transported me to\na food paradise: the hot\ncheesy middle rushed into\nmy mouth mixing with\nthe juicy mushroom and\nits crispy coating. If this\nis what the vegetarian\nrevolution is bringing,\nthen sign me up.\nSome of those legendary crinkle fries // Flickr/star5112\nWorth the Hype?\nShake Shack has\nbeen raved about in the\nUS, and now that it has\nset up a sustainable UK\nbase its hype will only\nget bigger. The offering\nof tastier \u201cartisanal\u201d\nfast food has certainly\nattracted a large pool of\nfollowers. Having tried\nits offerings I can agree\nthat the hype is certainly\nworth it.\nPrice\nBurger: \u00a35.50\nFries: \u00a33\nBest part\nThat mind-blowing\nvegetarian burger\nWorst part\nSize of the normal\nburger\n\n"

Forming the\nsecond album of their\ndiscography, FWN defines\na tension in growing up,\nan age without the serenading eloquence of Suck\nit and See or the matured\nconfidence of AM, but one\nso keenly aware of the\n\u2018joie de vivre\u2019 in the simplicity and carefreeness\nencapsulated in Whatever\nPeople say I am. (The\nintrospective Humbug\ndefies any attempt at\nlabelling it).\nKick-starting the album\nwith the breathless track\n\u2018Brianstorm\u2019, frontman\nand lyricist Alex Turner\nlaunches into a running\nnarrative of an individual who might as well\nbe called Zarathustra.\n\u201cBrian\u201d seems to break\nthe proverbial mould, as\nhe leaves \u201chundreds of\nblokes\u201d weeping, after\ntheir ladies tell him to\n\u201cuse me\u201d. Indeed, as\nanyone who had to spend\ntime around the Beit Quad\nsoon finds, an undercurrent of despairing lust\nruns beneath the deceptive\nsurface. In \u2018D is for Dangerous\u2019, Turner observes,\nwith equal parts disgust\nand schadenfreude, how\nthe lads talk their partner\ninto taking the \u2018D\u2019 whilst\n\u201ctrying to keep their\ntrousers on\u201d.\nThe ladies, for their\npart, are not as innocent as\nthey look, as they \u2018\u201ctake\noff their wedding ring\u201d,\nand whisper \u201cit\u2019s red wine\nthis time\u201d to their man for\nthe night. In the frenzy\nof disguised gentility\nand feigned innocence,\nAlex Turner imploringly\ncries that you won\u2019t find\nfulfilment in these desperate quarters, just as a\ndetective won\u2019t find his\nsuspect \u201cin a pair of dead\nman\u2019s eyes\u201d. Between the\nunflinching lyricism and\nMatt Helders\u2019 impeccable drumming, listeners\nwould find that Favourite\nWorst Nightmare is not\nso much a glorification\nof any paint-by-number\nkit for love, as it is itself\na search for the ineffable,\nlost and heartfelt. From\nthe teary plead in \u2018Do Me\nA Favour\u2019 where Turner\nasks for no-pulled-punch-es in the demise of a rela-tionship, (\u201cPerhaps fuck\noff might be too kind\u201d),\nto the snarl at gossipers to\nleave his past lover alone\nin \u2018If You Were There,\nBeware\u2019, the album closes\non \u2018505\u2019, the emotional\ndepth of which most assuredly propels the band\ninto Rock History. Backed\nup by an atmospheric\norgan, Turner paints a\nportrait of a girl waiting\nfor her weary traveller\nbehind door \u201c505\u201d, calm\nand knowing with \u201cher\nhands between her\nthighs\u201d. Another gem is\n\u2018Only Ones Who Know\u2019,\na naked confession and\nlonely testament to the\nexistence of Capital-t\nTrue love, its voice cold\nand broken like Leonard\nCohen\u2019s \u2018Hallelujah\u2019,\nits crescendo sure and\nunerring as King Solomon\u2019s \u2018Song of Songs\u2019.\nFiercely subversive and\nbreathlessly frenetic, Favourite Worst Nightmare\nis an impassioned take on\ngrowing up, losing a fight,\nas we all do, in capturing\nthe present against the\nuncompromising passage\nof time, where we trade\n\u201call the naughty nights\u2019\u201d\nfor \u2018niceness\u2019.

Now don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I like \u2018Dancing\nQueen\u2019 as much as the\nnext guy, but behind the\nfrolicking piano riffs and\nkaleidoscopic harmonies\nthere\u2019s a distinct lack of\nthe oomph and introspective vigour that they\u2019re\nknown and loved for.\nHumanz\nGorillaz\nControversial one\nmaybe. To give them\ncredit, the hype generated\nin advance of the release\nwas immense. Posters\nadorned the balustrades,\nbus stops and billboards\nof the country; the dis-dainful, animated eyes of\n2-D & friends (now ironically rendered in three\ndimensions) patrolled\nthe pavements like it\nwas 2001.

Despite their\nconsiderable following,\ntheir sophomore effort,\n2014\u2019s This is All Yours\nfell reasonably flat on its\nface. Sadly, the same was\ntrue (\u2206) of their latest\nouting. RELAXER starts\nstrongly; brooding opener\n\u20183WW\u2019 is comparable to\n\u2018Intro\u2019, and lead single \u2018In\nCold Blood\u2019 has the hi-fi\nauditory muscle of their\nearly work, albeit more\nradio friendly. However,\nit\u2019s not to last. The second\nside is barely worth mentioning \u2206, but just before\nthe break there\u2019s a dreary\ncover of \u2018House of the\nRising Sun\u2019, followed by\nthe seedy standout \u2018Hit Me\nLike That Snare\u2019, which\nis\u2026 well, it\u2019s always the\nquiet ones, isn\u2019t it? \u2206(\u2206\u2206)\nThis Old Dog\nMac DeMarco\nWe enjoyed 2, we\nadored Salad Days, we\nwere ambivalent about\nAnotherOne.MacDeMarco\u2019s latest foray, Another\nBloody One, sorry, This\nOld Dog, shows us Mac\nat his best.

Some recent hits\nstarted the show off, with\nthe 5-piece band strutting\nabout between wobbly\nlight sticks that littered\nthe stage. However, the\nband felt uneasy when\nthey moved onto their\nnewest songs, including\n\u2018The Way We Used To\nDo\u2019, the first single off the\nMark Ronson-produced\nalbum, released in August\nof this year. The bluesy\nperformance didn\u2019t seem\nto resonate with QOTSA\u2019s\ndiehard audience. This\nwas short lived though.\nThe band hit back with\ntwo classics off their\nacclaimed 2002 album\nSongs for the Dead; perhaps their most famous\nsong, \u2018No One Knows\u2019,\ngot the crowd going again\n(although no trousers\nwere removed). This also\nmarked the first of drummer Jon Theodore\u2019s solos,\nwith the new drummer\nproving his worth whilst\nHomme had a cigarette\nbreak on stage.

This\njuxtaposed the eerie and\nwistful \u2018I Appear Missing\u2019\nand \u2018Villains of Circumstances\u2019, performed in a\nnear operatic manner with\nsoft blue lighting centring\nin on Homme as the songs\ndrew out.

Defeated, you\nslump back into bed,\nclutching your pounding\nhead and cursing the decisions that led you to this\nmoment.\nMy friends, I have,\nafter substantial research,\nfound what I believe to\nbe the ultimate sesh fuel.\nHobgoblin, a product of\nWitchwood Brewery, is\na ruby ale which tastes\nnice, can be downed with\nminimal effort towards\nthe end of pres, and, most\nimportantly, is 5.2%. A\n500mL (2.6 units) bottle\ngoes for 1.39 in the local\nTezzers.\nThere are some very\nimportant consequences\nof this. Namely, this beats\nthe 3-for-5 deal: 3 for\n4.20 (ain\u2019t that a beautiful\ncoincidence?), serving up\n7.3 units of wonderful,\nwonderful ale. Few other\n\u201cnice\u201d beers compete; the\npopular Doom Bar is only\n4.3%, and usually costs\nin the range of 1.80 to 2\nquid per 500mL, and so is\nmuch less efficient when\nyou\u2019re trying to get out the\ndoor to Egg (house music\ndeeper than the scarring in\nmy liver).\nOh, but you observe,\nyou could just stick with\ntrusty ol\u2019 1664 or Stella,\nor, god forbid, Fosters.\nThey might not have the\npercentage, but they do\nhave the volume - you can\ngrab a pack of 4 tallbois\nfor a similar price. But\nthat\u2019s only 8 units, so\nfor the cost of drinking\nsomething less enjoyable,\nyou\u2019ve only gained a\nmargin of 0.7 units. Was it\nworth it?\nAnd this leads me to my\nlast and most important\npoint - drinkability under\nvarying circumstances.\nYou\u2019re heading out to the\nsesh, so you dunk your\ncans in your bag and set\nout on your merry way.\nBut unless it\u2019s the dead\nof winter, those cans are\ngonna start to warm up.\nA lager that ain\u2019t cold is a\nlager that ain\u2019t enjoyable.\nBetter get the road bevs in\nbefore they go lukewarm,\nand better hope that the\nsesh on the other end of\nthe journey has a fridge\nwith enough room for\nyour brews.\nCue the hobbo gobbo,\na beer which maintains its\ndrinkability and taste over\na wide range of temperatures and varying degrees\nof flatness. Your worries\nabout beer temperature\nessentially evaporate. I\nmean, sure, it\u2019s still preferable to imbibe chilled\n(quoth Strong Bad: \u201ca one\nthat is not cold is scarcely\na one at all\u201d). But the\nimplication of the act of\nimbibing warm entering\nthe realm of possibility\nhas profound consequenc-es.\nTo come full circle: it\u2019s\njust gone 11 AM, your\nhead is fuzzy, and you\nroll onto your side to a\nhalf-finished bottle of\nHobgoblin. Oh, merciful\ngods, yes!\nWeddings are shit and the Royals are lizards\nTurns out Grumpy Bastard hates weddings and the royals. What joy.\nW\nhen I heard\nabout the\ne n g a g e -ment of\nMiss Megahn Markle\nto Prince Harry, I was\nnon-plussed. I have zero\ninterest in other people\u2019s\nhappiness so I only noted\nthe annoying way she\nspelt Megan. Extra letters\nare a classically pretentious way of trying to\nmake something normal\nspecial. As a reminder to\neveryone out there that\nharbours these delusions,\nwe all die, and eventually\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nthe universe will end. No\none cares.\nMy main source of\nannoynance about this\nparticular topic is the\namount I\u2019m forced to see.\nNormally, I can ignore\nthe Royals by not reading\ntabloid newspapers. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong, I appreciate\nthe fear and ignorance that\nflood from the gates of\nMurdoch\u2019s media empire,\nbut unfortunately, they\ncost money to read and are\nslightly less economical\nthan actual toilet paper.\nI\u2019m confident that there\nwill now be daily updates\nas the national psyche\ngears up for the orgy of\ncoverage of the actual\nevent. If it was a funeral\nI might be interested, as I\nfeed on misery, but if the\nmedia essentially expects\nme to be estatic about\nsome healthy, happy\nand very wealthy people\nbecoming even happier,\nthey can fuck right off.\nWeddings are shit.\nI\u2019m fairly certain they\nare religion\u2019s version of\nchicken, where couples,\nbound by the chains of\nmarriage wait for their\ncounterpart to admit that\nthe relationship has failed\nand they hate them before\nan acrimonious divorce.\nThe best man\u2019s speech\nis always terrible, either\nattempting to be funny at\nthe groom\u2019s expense and\nfailing, or accidentally\nrevealing the STI-ridden\nsex the groom had with the\nstag-night stripper. The\namount of money spent on\nidiotic clich\u00e9s by gullible\ncouples so that they can\nremember this day for the\nrest of their lives, if only\nas the event that burnt a\nhole in their bank account\nand destroyed their\neconomic future. Half of\nthe guests don\u2019t want to\nbe there and resent the\nwedding because x or y\ncould do so much better.\nAdmittedly in this case, it\nis hard to see how either\nside could do better. One\nis a successful actress and\nUN goodwill ambassador,\nand the other has dressed\nup as a Nazi and showed\nhis genitals to Las Vegas.\nMy hatred of this particular wedding is deeply\nrooted in the fact that\nRoyals are involved. They\nare by far the most entitled\nand useless bastards in the\nworld with a poor history\nof weddings.\nI\u2019m unsure how long\nDiana lasted before Philip\ngave the order to closely\nacquaint her with a dash-board, but I have already\nplanned my response to\nthe divorce/assassination\nof Meghan in around\n20 years. Given Philip\u2019s\nadvanced age he probably\nwon\u2019t have to a second\ntime. Then again, it is\nwell known that lizards\ncan enter a trancelike state\nfor hundreds of years, so\nhe may be communicating\ntelepathically with MI5\nfor centuries to come.\nSomething that\ngarnered a significant\namount of coverage from\nall this shitstorm is the\nrace of Meghan Markle.\nQuite frankly, the race of\nHarry\u2019s betrothed doesn\u2019t\nmatter: all that matters is\nthat the Queen\u2019s current\nhost is getting on a bit and\nthey\u2019re all out of skins.\nMost of all, my focused\nhatred is directed towards\nthose students that set up\nbachelor and bachelorette\nparties for the bride\nand groom. Fuck your\npathetic attempt at the\npopularity contest that is\nsocial media and fuck the\nsociety that encourages\nyou. BBC news is truly\nfor the weak minded.\nTwo goblins enjoying a drink // HobgoblinHQ\n\n"

This is having disastrous\nconsequences. We can do better.\nR\necently I heard\nof the sad news\nof a lad from\nmy old school\ntaking his own life at the\nage of 20. As is often the\ncase he was the last person\nyou would expect to hear\nsuch terrible news about,\nalways laughing, joking\nand loved nothing more\nthan going to the football\nwith the lads. Although\nstereotypes have changed\nin recent times, there is\nstill social pressure for\nCOMMENT\nOlly Dove\nComment Writer\nmen to be independent,\nstrong and bottle up their\nemotion and worries.\nSuicide is now the\nleading cause of death\nin men under the age\nof 50. Let that statistic\nsink in. Not cancer,\nnot disease, not car\naccidents: suicide. From\nthis shocking statistic\nit is clear that men are\nnot getting the help they\nneed and the stigma surrounding men\u2019s mental\nhealth still very much\nexists.\nIt is common for\npeople suffering from\nmental health problems\nto hide it effectively and\nit is nearly always the\nlast people you would\nexpect. Two high profile\nexamples of this are\nTyson Fury and Dwayne\n\u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson.\nBoth are seen as highly\nsuccessful and above all\n\u2018tough guys\u2019, however\nboth have opened up\nabout having suffered\nwith mental health\nproblems in the past.\nMental health can\naffect anyone, but\nstigmas and social pressures prevent many men\nopening up and getting\nthe help they desperately need. We live in a\nsociety where men feel\npressured to conform\nto an often unrealistic\n\u2018macho\u2019 image and\ntalking about personal\nproblems is seen as a\nweakness.\nFor over 10 years\nmen have been growing\nmoustaches in the name\nof Movember, an increasingly well known\nnon profit charity which\nraises awareness for\nmen\u2019s health, including\nprostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental\nhealth, and suicide\nprevention. Since the\ncharity was launched\nthe campaign has raised\nover \u00a3440m for research\ninto men\u2019s health issues.\nWith charities like this\nbecoming ever more\npopular, men\u2019s mental\nhealth is finally getting\nthe publicity it needs.\nThere is no question\nthat university life is\nstressful; exams, coursework deadlines, moving\naway from home, and\nany number of other\npossibilities.

These two\ncategories do not always\nalign, and last week I\nran through some of the\nfilms that had awards\naspirations, but are now\nconsidered long shots, or\nout of the race entirely.\nThe first few prizes of\nthe season have begun\nto be handed out, with\nthe Gotham Awards on\nMonday and the National\nBoard of Review revealing their year-end lists on\nTuesday. This makes the\ncontinuation of this run\ndown of Oscar contenders\nall the more pertinent. So\nhere we go.\nPOSSIBILITIES\nCary Fukunaga, incidentally a screenwriter\non It, will be feeling a\nwhole lot of frustration if\nMudbound picks up Oscar\nnominations. Fresh from\ndelivering a tremendous\nfirst season of True Detective for HBO on tele-vision, he wrote, shot, and\ndirected war drama Beasts\nof No Nation for Netflix.\nIt should have been an\nawards season contender,\nand in particular Idris\nElba, who won the Screen\nActors Guild award for\nbest supporting actor for\nhis powerful turn as the\nCommandant, should\nhave been a major candidate for the Academy\nAward (he is to date the\nonly actor to win an SAG\naward and not be nominat\u201cThis year\nCall Me by\nYour Name\narrived like a\njuggernaut\u201d\ned for the Oscar). Instead,\nthe Academy turned its\nnoses up at Netflix\u2019s day\nand date release scheme\nand refused to acknowledge the film. Netflix are\nsticking by their release\nstrategy, but have brought\nin a number of industry\nveterans with experience of running awards\ncampaigns to help push\nMudbound. Dee Rees\u2019\nperiod drama, following\ntwo families in rural Mississippi post-World War\nII, would be a strong contender for a best picture\nnomination were it with\nFox Searchlight, Sony\nPictures Classics, Focus\nFeatures, or Amazon. Yet\nher film is with Netflix,\nand it remains to be seen if\nthey can mount a serious\nawards campaign and\nwin over the Academy\nwith a system that seems\nto undermine the traditional theatre experience.\nIt is possible that the\nnew influx of younger\nAcademy voters may aid\ntheir attempts.\nAlso benefiting from\nthe shake up to the\nAcademy membership\ncould be Get Out. Jordan\nPeele\u2019s suspenseful horror\nplayed well at Sundance\nand then stunned the\nworld, raking in huge\nsums against a very small\nbudget. Hugely profit-able, sheer hype alone\nmay drive it into awards\ncontention. On Monday\nit picked up three prizes\nat the Gotham Awards,\nand on Tuesday it was\nnamed on the National\nBoard of Review\u2019s list\nof the best films of the\nyear, as well as winning\nbest ensemble and best\ndirectorial debut. It is\nworth bearing in mind that\nfilms such as Baby Driver,\nLogan, The Disaster\nArtist, and Downsizing,\nthat are now considered\nout of the awards race\n(bar a couple of possible\nnominations for actor\nand adapted screenplay\nfor The Disaster Artist),\nwere also name-dropped\nby the National Board of\nReview. That being said,\nGet Out has a whole lot of\nmomentum behind it right\nnow.\nSimilarly, Wonder\nWoman, remarkably\nPatty Jenkins\u2019 first film\nsince she guided Charlize\nTheron to Oscar glory in\nMonster, was a box office\nsmash. Though beyond\nthe surface its content is\nstill formulaic tent-pole\nmaterial, the current\nnarrative seems to be that\nthis is some kind of great\nfeminist art piece (did\nanyone see Elle or The\nLove Witch last year?),\nand that may resonate\nwith the new left wing\ninflux of Academy voters.\nIt is somehow possible\nthat Wonder Woman will\nsucceed where The Dark\nKnight failed, and be the\nfirst superhero film to earn\na best picture nomination.\nAmazon\u2019s hopes will\nnow be pinned on their\nSummer release The Big\nSick, which is the highest\ngrossing indie of the year.\nPlaying well at Sundance,\nKumail Nanjiani plays\nhimself in the intriguing\nstory of how him and his\nwife fell in love, in the\nbest romantic comedy to\nsurface for years.\nOne film that may\nactually suffer from the\nchanges to the voting body\nis Joe Wright\u2019s Darkest\nHour. Wright\u2019s Atonement was a seven-time\nOscar nominee, but his\nlatest is not as strong. Following Winston Churchill\nduring his early days as\nprime minister during the\nSecond World War, this\nfeels like it would have\nbeen a lock for a best\npicture nomination a few\nyears ago, but with the\nAcademy expanding the\ntype of films it is willing\nto honour, the only sure\nthing with this one is\nGary Oldman\u2019s best actor\nnomination.\nMAJOR THREATS\nThese films should earn\nbest picture nominations,\nbut will likely fall short in\ntheir pursuit of the grand\nprize. Guillermo del Toro\nWill Darkest Hour be holding the V for Victory at the Oscars next year? // Jack English Focus Features\n\u201cWonder\nWoman will\nsucceed where\nThe Dark\nKnight failed,\nand be the\nfirst superhero\nfilm to earn a\nbest picture\nnomination\u201d\nreturns with his best film\nsince Pan\u2019s Labyrinth.\nThat film won three of\nits six Oscar nominations\nand is a modern classic.\nDel Toro has a penchant\nfor fairy tales, and this\none is a Douglas Sirk-type\nromance film concerning\nthe burgeoning affection\nbetween a mute janitor\nand a mysterious Merman-like creature. The\nShape of Water picked up\nthe Golden Lion at Venice,\nand should certainly\nreceive nominations for\npicture, direction, screen-play, and Sally Hawkins\u2019\nlead performance as well\nas registering in many of\nthe technical categories.\nAmidst the glitz and\nglam of Cannes, the ea-gle-eyed of us will have\npicked out the return of\nSean Baker as one to\nwatch. Baker is most\nfamous for shooting his\nsensational Tangerine on\nan iPhone 5c, the same\nphone the rest of us used\nfor blurry night out photos\nand questionable selfies.\nWith The Florida Project,\nhe does continue to use\nsome iPhone footage,\nbut the majority of this\nsublime film, set on the\noutskirts of the Walt\nDisney World resort\nand told from a child\u2019s\nperspective, is shot on\nglorious 35mm film.\nThis one will have you\nsmiling and crying at the\nsame time, a look that will\nmake you glad you are sat\nin a dark theatre where no\none can see you. A24 succeeded in pushing another\nFlorida-based project,\nMoonlight, all the way to\nthe big prize last year, but\nultimately The Florida\nProject will probably fall\njust short.\nAnother A24 distributed picture is Lady Bird,\nthe semi-autobiograph-ical directorial debut of\nrenowned indie actress\nGreta Gerwig. Driven by\na fierce performance from\nSaoirse Ronan, Gerwig\u2019s\ndirection is assured and\nauthentic. This film\nemerged unexpectedly\nstrong from the fall\nfestivals, and Ronan will\ncement herself as one of\nthe finest young actresses\nin the world with a third\nOscar nomination at the\nyoung age of 23. Gerwig\u2019s\noriginal screenplay (which\nis allegedly 350 pages\nlong and yet has managed\nto yield a 93 minute film)\nshould also earn a nod, and\nLaurie Metcalfe is a good\ncandidate for supporting\nactress. Rising young\nactors Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\nand Lucas Hedges also\ndeliver the goods here.\nEight of the last ten\nwinners of the People\u2019s\nChoice Award at the\nToronto International\nFilm Festival have gone\non to receive a best picture\nnomination, making it a\nvery good indicator of\nawards season success.\nPast winners include\nSlumdog Millionaire, The\nKing\u2019s Speech, 12 Years a\nSlave, and La La Land, all\nof which won best picture\n(of course La La Land\u2019s\nvictory lasted a matter of\nseconds as they had to\nhand over their award to\nactual winner Moonlight).\nThis year Three Billboards\nOutside Ebbing, Missouri\npipped runner-up The\nShape of Water to the\nprize. Martin McDonagh\nhas a strong track record\nwith dark comedies, but\nthis is the first time it all\ntruly comes together in\na cohesive manner for\nhim. Fortunately, this coincides with his best cast\never, including Frances\nMcDormand, Woody\nHarrelson, Sam Rockwell,\nLucas Hedges, and Caleb\nLandry Jones. There is a\nsearing drama against the\nbackdrop of McDonagh\u2019s\nblack humour which\nmakes this film far more\neffective and profound\nthan anything he has\ndone before. McDormand\ndelivers an intimidatingly\npowerful performance as\nthe foul-mouthed mother\nwho takes matters into\nher own hands when the\npolice struggle to come up\nwith a suspect in the case\nof the rape and murder\nof her teenage daughter.\nShe is the favourite to win\nbest actress, adding to her\nwin for Fargo. Rockwell\nmay score a first nod for\nsupporting actor. McDonagh\u2019s screenplay is a\nshoe in for a nomination\ntoo.\nWe\u2019re gonna reveal our\noverall winners in next\nweek\u2019s Felix grand finale\n\u2013 tune in next week for the\nthrilling conclusion!\nGot Milk? // BFI\n\u201cLady Bird\nemerged\nunexpectedly\nstrong from\nthe fall\nfestivals, and\nRonan will\ncement herself\nas one of the\nfinest young\nactors in the\nworld\u201d\nDid you know you can tell a ladybird\u2019s age by the number of spots? // A24\nFilm Editors strike back: Judgement Day: Reloaded\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1678\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nSeeing the world through literature \u2013 so many books,\nso little time\nReading goes hand in hand with travelling, introducing you to local novels, new ideas, and amazing bookshops\nBOOKS\nPavan Inguva\nBooks writer\nS\neeing another\npart of the world\nis quite an exciting prospect\nfor anyone: different\nfoods, culture, history,\nand \u2013 most importantly\n\u2013 visiting beautiful bookstores and discovering\nauthors you would not\nhave heard of otherwise.\nPicking up a book, albeit\ntranslated to English, by\na local author has been a\ntremendously rewarding\nexperience. These writers\nprovide an excellent\nsnapshot of their country,\ndrawing upon the area\u2019s\nhistory, socioeconomic\nand cultural backgrounds,\nand quite often, their own\npersonal experiences. To\nread the book and be able\nto see the actual location\nor art piece referenced\nsimultaneously magnifies\nthe enjoyment of both the\ntrip (and its memories)\nand of the read. To that\nend, I have always made\nan effort to find a nice\nbookstore in whichever\ncountry I visit and purchase an appropriate book.\nExamples of such finds\ninclude Lafcaido Hearn\u2019s\nKokoro from Japan, Cees\nNooteboom\u2019s Rituals\nfrom The Netherlands,\nand Toomas Vint\u2019s The\nSweepstakes of Love from\nEstonia, amongst others.\nToomas Vint\u2019s The\nSweepstakes of Love\nI bought this book\nfrom a small bookstore\nin Tallinn, half expecting a treatise on love,\nthe human experience,\nfutility etc. Rather, Vint\nwrote a sophisticated two\npart series. The first part\nconsists of a semi-auto-biographical collection of\nshort stories conceptually\nsimilar to what I am sure\nanyone who enjoys\nsilent contemplation and\nreading does daily. Picture\nthe inner monologue we\nall have, narrating our\nthoughts, feelings, and\nactions in relation to\nour changing selves and\nsurroundings. From that\ndescription, we add layers\nof nuance, reflections, and\nphilosophical musings\nto paint a personal story\nand occasionally, we\nmight embellish the truth\nslightly or conceive of\nstories for other people\nwe briefly encounter.\nVint skilfully crafts such\na story, describing scenes\nfrom his life growing up\nand living in Soviet-era\nEstonia as an artist. In an\nearly story, Vint describes\nthe time he attended a\nSoviet Pioneers camp,\nexploring the tension that\nexisted between Russian\nand western parts of the\nunion, resulting in Vint\nbeing beaten up. Another\nstory describes Vint\u2019s\nrun-in with the KGB after\nhis close friend defects\nfrom the Soviet Union,\nresulting in both Vint and\nhis wife being investigated thoroughly. The second\npart, aptly titled \u2018A Flock\nof Delusions\u2019 consists\nof purely fictional short\nstories in a postmodern\nstyle and is worth a read\nby itself.\nWe are remarkably\nahistorical about the\ngood or bad that goes\non around us. In a bid to\nmove on, people quickly\nrelegate the past events\nthat affected them barely\na generation ago. Visiting\nthe KGB museum at the\nViru Hotel in Tallinn was\na poignant reminder of\nthe extent of control on\nthought and life by the\nSoviet State. Reading\nVint\u2019s description of\nhis own experiences\nand seeing his art in the\nKUMU museum (Vint\nis a painter as well) reinforced the images I saw\nand provided me insight\ninto Estonian culture and\nperspectives.\nCees Nooteboom\u2019s\nRituals\nWhat made this read\ninteresting within the\ncontextofseeingtheworld\nisn\u2019t too much about the\ncontent, but rather where it\nwas purchased. This book\nwas purchased in Maastricht at the Bookstore\nDominicanen, supposedly\none of the most beautiful\nbookstores in the world. It\nwas quite the sight, seeing\na bookstore in a stunning\n13th century church: the\nsunlight strikes the books\nto magical effects and\nintricate murals adorn the\nceiling.\nRituals itself was quite\nthe fascinating read.\nNooteboom constructs\na sublime narrative,\nweaving in existentialism\nin how people structure\ntheir lives, the experience\nof foreign cultures, and\nthen challenges the reader\nto reflect on how they\nthemselves approach\nlife. Inni Wintrop, the\ndilettante, in recognising\nthe meaninglessness of\nlife, floats through it. He\nentertains himself with art\nand casual sex and funds\nit by art sales and trading\non the stock market. He\nis unable to commit to\nanything: even his suicide\nattempt failed following\nhis divorce. Nooteboom\ninterestingly contrasts\ndifferent approaches to\ncoping with the existential\ndread we all have by introducing a father-son pair\n(the Taads) who, whilst\nsimilar in their rigid\nstructuring of their lives in\nself-contained bubbles, do\nso very differently. Taads\nsenior thoroughly plans\nevery single minute of\nhis life, striving to extract\nevery moments\u2019full worth\nin a futile attempt to live\na full life. Taad junior on\nthe other hand contrived a\nunique flavour of oriental\nself-mortification, turning\nto religion and spirituality\nto cope with the same\ndread everyone has. I\nmust point out that Rituals\nwas not at all depressing\nand was one of the best\nreads in 2016 for me.\nI would highly recommend these books to\nanyone looking for a read\nover Christmas or at the\nvery least, those who want\nto add a literary element\nto their travels.\nBookstore Dominicanen, a holy place for bookworms// Wikimedia\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFRIDAY, 1ST\nDECEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n6\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nActually stop and think about it: tuition fees\njust don\u2019t make sense\nThe arguments against tuition fees far outweigh any benefits their defendants claim. It\u2019s time\nto scrap them.\nPOLITICS\nBen Cliff\nPolitics Writer\nT\nhe debate over\ntuition fees is one\nof the most prevalent in British\npolitics, jostling with the\nlikes of Brexit and the\nNHS crisis for the spot\nof most important issue\nfacing young voters at the\ngeneral election earlier\nthis year. Obviously, as\nthe demographic who\nsuffer the most directly\nfrom their imposition,\nuniversity students are\n(at least at a glance)\noverwhelmingly against\ntuition fees and any proposed increases to them,\nhence writing an article\nto a student newspaper in\nopposition to them could\nbe seen as more than a\nlittle pointless. However,\nI shall attempt to outline\nsome of the plethora of arguments against them that\ngo beyond mere financial\nself-interest.\nFor starters, we have\nthe UK\u2019s majorly flawed\nstudent finance system,\nwhich loans students the\nmoney for their fees and\ngeneral living costs whilst\nat university, in exchange\nfor repayments over the\n30 years following a student\u2019s graduation, at a rate\nof 9% of their salary over\n\u00a321,000 plus interest.\nThis system is certainly\na good deal for students,\nas it almost completely\nmitigates our losses if our\ndegree fails to add value\nto our future earnings \u2013\ncomparable to companies\nthat guarantee their\ncustomers a refund if the\nproduct they bought fails\nto function as it should.\nwith only 55% of the\ntotal money loaned ever\nbeing repaid as things\nstand. For those who\nback tuition fees on the\nbasis that degrees ought\nto be funded by people\nwho directly benefit from\nthem as opposed to the\ntaxpayer, this means that\naround half of that \u00a39250\nper student per year is\ntax-funded regardless.\nThis reduces the effective\namount graduates pay to\nuniversities via the government loan scheme to\nless than a quarter of total\nuniversity income.\nThese statistics explain\nexactly why the argument\nfor tuition fees on the\nbasis that students ought\nto foot their own costs is\nabsolutely bonkers: they\njust cost everyone more.\nAs was conveniently\npointed out in last month\u2019s\narticle in defence of fees,\nthe average graduate can\nexpect an annual salary\nthat is significantly higher\nthan those who do not\nattend university \u2013 they\nare the people who will\ntend to go on to pay higher\ntaxes than the general\npopulace. In fact, due to\ntheir salary premium, they\nend up paying an average\nof \u00a38,000 more in income\ntax than they borrowed to\npay for university in the\nfirst place \u2013 this is on top\nof the money they spend\nin loan repayments.\nA further issue with\nour current system is the\nemotive form of debate\nfacilitated by having a\nloan system. When politicians and public figures\nare commonly tossing\naround such phrases as\n\u201cfifty thousand pounds\nworth of debt\u201d, can they\nreally be surprised when\nstudents complain that it\ndoesn\u2019t sound particularly\nfair? Of course, this is\nregularly followed by the\naforementioned statistics\nto factor in the wider\neconomic benefits of\npeople attending univer-sity. A more educated\npopulation can innovate\nmore and perform more\nhighly skilled jobs, which\nin turn means more money\nis spent and earned in the\ncountry, so governments\ncan take in more tax\nrevenue to spend on improving or creating public\nservices, which increases\neveryone\u2019s quality of life.\nYes, these effects are difficult to measure and may\nseem intangible, but they\nimprove everyone\u2019s lives,\ngraduate or not. It seems\nutterly ridiculous to economically disincentivise\nsuch behaviour!\nWhilst these more\nnuanced ways of looking\nat the issue may not\nappeal to the archaic view\nthat whatever one costs an\ninstitution must be paid\nback directly and precise-ly, those of us who oppose\ntuition fees may at least\ntake solace in knowing\nthat our viewpoint makes\ndemonstrably more sense.\nThe entirety of modern\nWestern civilisation is\nbased upon the fact that\nlife does not have to be a\nzero-sum game \u2013 someone\nsomewhere doesn\u2019t necessarily have to pay a price\nso that you can gain a\nbenefit. There are many\nways to fix this issue: a\ngraduate tax (which has its\nproblems, but is at least an\nimprovement), or perhaps\njust generally raising\ntaxation levels slightly to\nalleviate pressure on other\npublic services as well.\nOne thing is for certain:\ntuition fees are not the\nanswer.\n\u201cSiri, get me a picture of money\u201d// Flickr\n\u201cA more\neducated\npopulation can\ninnovate more\nand perform\nmore highly\nskilled jobs\u201d\nabout degrees adding\nvalue to future earnings,\nbut once you\u2019ve planted\nthe seed of that feeling of\ninjustice, you\u2019ve already\ngone a long way towards\npolarising the argument.\nAll that\u2019s needed to finish\nit off is for another group\nof people to start calling\nyoung people \u201centitled\u201d\nand \u201cungrateful\u201d, and lo\nand behold, you\u2019ve ended\nany chance of rational\ndebate and compromise!\nOf course, we\u2019re yet to\neven touch upon the actual\nreason that governments\nwant their citizens to go\nto university. Though I\nwould hate to generalise,\nin my experience, those\nwho argue in favour of\ntuition fees don\u2019t tend\n\u201cWe have the\nUK\u2019s majorly\nflawed student\nfinance\nsystem, which\nis vastly\ninefficaciou:\nonly 55% of\nmoney lonaed\nis paid back\u201d\nNevertheless, it is\nvastly inefficacious,\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 1ST\nDECEMBER, 2017 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n20\nJustice League fails to save the (cinematic) day\nJ\nustice League had\na lot to prove from\nthe get go. With\nthree critically\npanned films and only one\nmoderate successfully\nmovie in Wonder Woman,\nWarner Brothers and DC\nComics had a lot to make\nup for and improve upon.\nWhile Justice League is\nultimately a step in the\nright direction, it doesn\u2019t\nquite hit the mark and\nis an overall haphazard\nexecution. Throughout\nthis review, I\u2019ll be constantly comparing this\nfilm to other superhero\nmovies. While some of\nyou may think this unfair,\nI disagree for two reasons.\nFirst, there are enough of\nthem at this point that we\npretty much have a benchmark for what is expected;\nsecond of all, this is the\nfricking Justice League.\nThey are the most well\nknown superhero team\nto fans and to the general\npublic, hence they had a\nlot to live up to.\nOne improvement over\nthe mediocre Batman V\nSuperman is that the story\nactually makes sense and\nis not overly complicated.\nHaving said that, it is very\nsimple and conventional;\ngeneric bad guy wreaks\nhavoc and the heroes have\nto come together and save\nthe day. Some of you may\nargue that this is a blockbuster movie where you\nshould focus on the spectacle and ignore the story.\nHowever, other superhero\nfilms have been able to go\nbig and beyond while at\nthe same time exploring\nthemes and ideas, such as\nfamily and relationships in\nGuardians of the Galaxy,\nor centering on a character\nand watching their growth\nand development like in\nSpider-Man Homecoming\nor any good origin story\nfor that matter.\nThe main villain,\nSteppenwolf, is as paper\nthin as the plot. First of\nall, a personal gripe: out\nof all the villains in comic\nbook lore, they went with\nSteppenwolf, a character\nso obscure that I\u2019m sure\nonly hardcore fanboys\nwould know who he is.\nOn the one hand, this\ndid mean that the writers\ncould have written him\nin a new and interesting\ndirection. Unfortunately,\nthey don\u2019t really do this\nand Steppenwolf is as\nbland and uninteresting\nas most marvel movie\nvillains. Not only that,\nbut he\u2019s also 100% CGI,\nwhich honestly, is not the\nnicest thing to look at for\nthe most part.\nOne area where the film\ndoes succeed though is in\nthe Leaguers themselves.\nAll the characters are\ngiven an adequate amount\nof screen time and come\nwith their degrees of personality and quirks. They\nare also written much\nbetter and more optimistic\ncompared to some characters\u2019 dark and dreary\nportrayals in Batman V\nSuperman. It might have\ntaken three films, but they\nfinally nail the character\nof Superman and Henry\nCavill is able to bring\nthe warmth and soul that\nmakes Superman such a\nhopeful and heroic icon.\nThe overall tone of\nthe film was also more\nhopeful and optimistic\nthan the previous DCEU\nentries, save for Wonder\nWoman, which is how\nI believe superhero\nadaptations should be\nand what Marvel gets\nright. I\u2019m not saying you\ncan\u2019t have stories with a\ndarker direction, but that\nshouldn\u2019t come at the cost\nof character and story\ndevelopment as is the case\nin Batman V Superman.\nFor those of you who\ndon\u2019t know, the production process was a bit of\na mess with two directors\nhaving been in charge of\nthe film at different times.\nFor the most part, the film\nfeels like a Zack Snyder\nmovie with its darker\natmosphere and operatic\naesthetic. Some scenes\nhave a very distinct Joss\nWhedon feel and while\nit\u2019s alright for the most\npart, some scenes are just\na bit jarring and seem a\nlittle out of place.\nOne of the main issues\nwith this film, however,\nis the fact that there\nare no real stakes. The\nparademons facing the\nLeague are just awkward\nand bland CGI monsters\nwith nothing particularly\ninteresting about them.\nWe never see anyone\nreally have their life in\ndanger, be it the heroes or\nany civilians. In Avengers,\nfor example, there was\nalways a sense of danger\nand threat in most of the\naction sequences, either to\nthe main characters or to\nany unfortunate bystanders caught in the crossfire.\nWithout these kinds of\nsituations, it\u2019s hard to\nreally get engrossed in the\nJustice League and care as\nmuch as we should. For\nsome odd reason, there\nare some scenes which\nfocus on a particular\npayoff which leads to a\nlacklustre payoff. If these\nscenes were scrapped in\nfavour of other things that\nare more plot-relevant, the\nmovie would have been a\ntouch better.\nWarner Bros. are\nclearly trying to catch\nup to Marvel Studios\nand reach that level of\nsuccess before the superhero movie bubble bursts.\nWith Justice League,\nthey were trying to do a\ncourse correction from\nBatman V Superman as\nwell as make audiences\ncare enough about these\ncharacters to want to see\nmore of them. While the\nfilm mostly succeeds in\nthese objectives and is at\nleast somewhat entertain-ing, it does so in a sloppy\nand flawed execution that\nleaves one frustrated for\nsomething more.\nThe guy you should be worried about // Warner Bros.

I\u2019m a\nlone female traveller who\ndoesn\u2019t understand clubs\nand booze, but I do love\ncycling, and Thailand has\nsome great mountains\nwith well-maintained\nroads. And thus, I went\non a cycling holiday to\nThailand.\nAcross the world\nTruth be told, this trip\nwasn\u2019t my idea. There\u2019s\nan annual cycling festival\nheld in Chiang Mai that\nI\u2019d wanted to go to the\nprevious two years but\ncouldn\u2019t due to uni \u2013 but\nthis year was my year!\nMy exams finished in\nMay, so in mid-July I\nwas to head off to Chiang\nMai with my bike. A taxi\nto the airport would have\nbeen \u00a340+, but fortunately\nthere\u2019s a courier service,\nAirportr (#notspons),\nfrom central London to\nvarious Heathrow terminals for only \u00a330. So I\npacked my bike up into\na cardboard bike box,\nand it was picked up and\ntaken swiftly to Heathrow\nTerminal 2. Meanwhile, I\npicked up some Thai baht\n(local currency), prepared\nmy room to be sublet, and\nthen made my way down\nto the airport by tube. I\nhave to admit that leaving\nfor a month-long trip to\nthe other side of the world\ngavemelastminutenerves\nso my flatmate basically\nhad to push me out the\ndoor. When I finally made\nit to Heathrow, I collected\nmy bike and proceeded\nto check in \u2013 other than\nhaving to fit the bike box\nin the lift and through the\nmaze of crowd control\nstanchions, it all went\nsmoothly. I was very\npleased that my chosen\nairline, Eva Airways,\ntreated my bike very well.\nOh, and a minor detail \u2013 I\nwalked past Andy Murray\nat the airport, who was\narriving home from the\nFrench Open (just casual\nthings).\nFirst day adventures\nMy journey from\nBangkok airport to my\naccommodation was\nmuch more challenging.\nSince my flight was\ndelayed, I was afraid to\nmiss the train to Chiang\nMai, so in a mad-panic I\nbooked an Airbnb in the\ncentre of Bangkok. Also,\nwhen I picked up my\nbike at the airport, I had\nit put together for me in\na bike shop, which, on\nreflection, was a bad idea.\nBy the time I got it back,\nit was late, and I had a\nlot of luggage with me,\nso I couldn\u2019t cycle to my\naccommodation; instead,\nI took a taxi but had to\nremove the front wheel for\nthe bike to fit. Then unfor-tunately, after a draining\njourney, I didn\u2019t manage\nto get a well-deserved\nsleep \u2013 in the extreme heat\nand humidity, the AC only\nworked with the lights on,\nand my jet lag also didn\u2019t\nhelp in the process. But\nthat\u2019s what travelling is\nall about \u2013 stepping out of\nyour comfort zone to gain\ninvaluable experiences.\nChasing cool air\nThe next day I booked\nan overnight train to\nChiang Mai, but I still had\nsome time in Bangkok\nbefore it departed. I ended\nup visiting a cute little\nlocal vegan restaurant\n(shout out to happycow.\nnet for the recommenda-tion; again, #notspons),\nwhere I met a lovely Thaiborn Chinese lady, who,\nat 50 years old, was just\nstarting to learn Mandarin\nto reconnect with her\nfamily back in China.\nI spent the rest of my\ntime at the train station\nbecause it was the only\nplace nearby with air-con-ditioning (it\u2019s REALLY\nhot, okay?), which also\noffered various shops and\nfree WiFi for international\ntourists (#priorities).\nFinally, I boarded my\ntrain to Chiang Mai with\nmy bike \u2013 the process was\nsimple but required extra\npayment. I took the sleeper\ntrain instead of flying or\ntaking a taxi because it\u2019s\nan iconic part of a trip to\nThailand and I also aimed\nto arrive in Chiang Mai\nearly to have enough time\nto find accommodation\nthere. Here\u2019s a tip for you:\nif you\u2019re going on holiday,\nbook your accommodation in advance, at least for\na couple of nights. Please.\nJust trust me on this. My\nexperience wasn\u2019t awful\nby any means, but it would\nhave been much better if\nI\u2019d done the bookings in\nadvance.\nA month of cycling\nUpon arrival in Chiang\nMai, I caught a songthaew\n(a type of passenger\nvehicle) to the area I\nwanted to stay in. Fortunately, this time my bike\nfitted in the car, but since\nsongthaews don\u2019t have\nCalling all cyclists: take your bike on holiday for an\nunforgettable cycling adventure\nTourists love Thailand for its beautiful beaches, hot weather, and unconventional attractions. However, recent\nImperial graduate Charlotte Pickering experienced a different kind of holiday \u2013 she went to a cycling festival in\nChiang Mai and spent a month exploring the city by bike.\nCharlotte Pickering\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\n\u201cHere\u2019s a tip for\nyou: if you\u2019re\ngoing on\nholiday, book\nyour hostels\nin advance,\nat least for\na couple of\nnights. Please.\nJust trust me\non this\u201d\nStairway to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, the temple at the top of Doi Suthep // Flickr\nBreath-taking views of Chiang Mai from above are worth every turn of the pedal // Flickr\nbacks, I held onto my\nbike to stop it from falling\noff. There was another\npassenger, a Swiss girl,\nand it turned out she\nwas there because of the\nsame festival, though not\nas a participant. When I\nmentioned that I had not\nbooked a place to stay\nyet, she kindly invited\nme to stay at hers, while I\nfigured it out. We dumped\nour stuff at hers and spent\nmost of the day walking\naround the city, eating\nexotic fruit, and then going\non a tuk tuk tour (another\nThai vehicle). In the end,\nwe decided it was a scam\nand refused to pay full\nprice for it. So be vigilant!\nWe eventually arrived in\nthe neighbourhood I was\nhoping to stay in, and after\nwandering down a dead-end, we met a friendly\nThai lady who gave us a\nride on her motorcycle to\nthe right place. Finally,\nafter hours of searching, I\nended up at some student\naccommodation, where I\nmanaged to rent a room\nfor the rest of my trip. As\nI was moving my stuff\nfrom my Airbnb to the\nnew place, my songthaew\ndriver wasn\u2019t impressed\nwith me taking the bike\non-board, charging me\nmore for it. But since it\nwas late at night and we\nwere in the middle of\nnowhere, I had to accept\nthe sudden price hike.\nAnd at this point, my\ncycling holiday actually\nstarted! I spent a few\ndays cycling and walking\naround with the Swiss\ngirl (who rented a bike, as\nthere are many bike rental\nshops in Chiang Mai).\nThen, I cycled up Doi\nSuthep, a mountain right\noutside of Chiang Mai.\nIt took me two attempts,\nthanks to my dodgy knee,\nwhich was injured as I was\nhit by a cab while cycling\nin London. Nevertheless,\neven if tiring, cycling up\nthe mountain was an incredible experience. The\nroad goes up to a classic\nThai Buddhist temple with\nbreath-taking views of the\ncity, well worth the challenging ride. However,\nthe ride down was absolutely terrifying \u2013 going\nthat fast on a bike did\nnot feel safe, but drivers\nin Chiang Mai are very\ngood around bicycles, so I\nknew that controlling my\nspeed was the only thing\nI needed to worry about.\nIn my opinion, cycling is\na great way to get around\nChiang Mai, since cars\nand motorcycles are re-spectful. Also, bike theft\nis minimal \u2013 I did take a D\nlock for peace of mind, but\na chain lock would have\nbeen more than enough.\nMany times I left my bike\nparked unlocked, or just\nlocked to itself, and it was\nstill there when I got back.\nAnd finally, my favourite\nrestaurant, Imm Aim, had\na bike rack outside which\nheld up to 8 bikes, so it\u2019s\nindeed a bike friendly city.\nTime to come back\nThe journey back to\nLondon was a bit differ-ent. I decided to fly to\nBangkok instead of taking\nthe train, so I had to buy\na bike box in Chiang\nMai. These get sold for\nrecycling, meaning that\nbike shops might not have\nany, so if this is something\nyou need, it would be best\nto seek one out a few days\nin advance. I was staying\novernight in Bangkok so I\nstored my packed bike at\nthe airport\u2019s left luggage\nservice, which cost 100\nbaht for 24 hours. It\u2019s\ncommon knowledge that\nwhen taking a bike on a\nplane, the tyres should be\nflat. However, the airlines\nnormally don\u2019t check this,\nand the inner tubes don\u2019t\ntend to explode under the\naircraft conditions. But\nsince my bike box had\nsmall holes for holding\nit, the lady who was\nchecking me in noticed\nthat I hadn\u2019t put down my\ntyres. Unfortunately, this\nmeant that I had to climb\nupon the baggage scales\nand put down both of my\ntyres through this small\nhole. In the future, I won\u2019t\ntry to be cheeky and will\nput down my tyres before-hand, especially if they\u2019re\nvisible through the box.\n\u201cCycling is a\ngreat way to\nget around\nChiang Mai,\nsince cars and\nmotorcycles\nare respectful.\nAlso, bike theft\nis minimal\u201d\n\u201cBreath-taking\nviews of the\ncity were well\nworth the\nchallenging\nride\u201d\nThe rest of the trip\nwas easy. Shout out to\nmy mum for picking me\nup at Heathrow, saving\nme from paying for the\nbike shipping. That being\nsaid, AirPortr was a great\nservice and I\u2019d definitely\nuse them again. I\u2019d also\nrecommend using the left\nluggageserviceatairports,\ne.g. to store your bike or\nany other large luggage\npieces, if this can help\nyou with your journey. It\nfelt scary giving my bike\nto people I didn\u2019t know\nin a foreign country but\nit meant that I didn\u2019t have\nto lug a large box around\nBangkok again, which is\nless than fun.\n\n"

We pick\nsides, and become entirely\ninvested in the fate of a\nsingle octopus. All that\nserves to make the sucker\npunch, when it comes, all\nthe more gut-wrenching.\nThis stunning tapestry of\nlife and colour faces an\nexistential risk, and we\u2019d\nreally rather not talk about\nit: climate change.\nWhen it comes to\nclimate change, I used\nto do what most people\nwould \u2013 I ignored it as\nbest I could. The whole\nthing was too overpower-ing, and it\u2019s often hard to\nknow where to start. As\na fresher, though, I took\na chance on joining the\nEnvironmental Society.\nHad I not gone to that\nfirst meeting, I\u2019d probably\nhave carried on as before,\nhaving unconsciously\nconstructed a life that\ndidn\u2019t really leave space\nfor caring about climate\nchange.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why\nwe\u2019d like to ignore\nclimate change; after\nall, it\u2019s hardly a cheery\nsubject. There\u2019s growing\nevidence of the toll that\nclimate change takes on\nour mental health, even\ndisregarding its physical\neffects on the globe. A\n2009 report found that\nAmericans are already\nsuffering a \u201cpre-traumatic\nstress disorder\u201d due to\nthe burden of climate\nchange on their minds;\nthe effect is even worse\namong scientists in the\nfield. Reluctance to think\nabout such a painful topic\nis pretty understandable.\nThe other key is the\nfact that I was even able\nto ignore climate change\nat all. Part of this is that\nthe famously unreliable\nBritish weather is actually\nreliably dull by global\nstandards. While other\ncountries are already\nfeeling the impact of\nstronger hurricanes\nand prolonged summer\ndroughts, the UK is likely\nto escape the worst effects.\nfirst to suffer are often the\nleast-equipped to cope.\nThe recent COP23 summit\nin Bonn \u2013 the largest\ninternational gathering to\ntake action against climate\nchange \u2013 was presided\nover by the government of\nFiji. The tiny island-nation\nwas unable to afford even\nto host the conference\non climate change; how\non Earth is it supposed\nto afford to protect itself\nagainst the actual thing?\nHaving contributed\napproximately zero to\nthe problem, and lacking\nany infrastructure to deal\nwith it, Fiji and other\nPacific island nations will\nnevertheless pay the price\nfor the lethargy of developed countries. We can\nonly afford to ignore the\nproblem at home because\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nA\ns Ethics and Environment Officer,\nmy job is to support and facilitate\ncampaigns to make our university\nfairer, greener, and more\nsustainable. Below are some things I\u2019ve been\nup to so far this term; if you think that there\u2019s\nsomething I\u2019ve missed, or that I could help\nyou with, email me at icu-environmental@\nic.ac.uk\n\u2022 Attending meetings with Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services) and Union\nfinance team to scrutinise the Union\u2019s\ndivestment plans, and ensure that the\ntargets set out in last year\u2019s divestment\npaper are met.\n\u2022 I\u2019m in contact with the Union to help\nshape the Union\u2019s divestment branding and\npublicity.\n\u2022 As part of Divest Imperial, I\u2019m\ncoordinating the hand-in of the petition\ncalling on College to divest from fossil fuels.\nLIBERATION\nRhidian Thomas\nEthics and Environment\nOfficer\nStudents need to make their voices heard // Wikimedia\nsomebody else can\u2019t in\ntheirs.\nSo what do we do? We\nhave a choice. One option\nis to trust politicians and\nbig business to sort things\nout, two groups that can\nalways be relied upon to\nact in humanity\u2019s best\ninterests. The other option\nis that we try to make\na difference ourselves.\nNo one person can do it\nalone; what\u2019s needed is\na collective effort. Put\npressure on things that\nare within your power to\nchange, and remember\nthat something is always\nbetter than nothing.\nOne thing we all share\nis Imperial \u2013 the clean,\ngreen, hi-tech university\nthat recently came 141st\nin\nPeople & Planet\u2019s league\ntable of the UK\u2019s greenest\nuniversities. We can do\nbetter, and as students\nwe should demand that\nwe do better. A good\nfirst step for the College\nwould be to remove\nits dirty investments in\nsome of the planet\u2019s most\nunethical and unscientific\nindustries, the very same\nones gleefully paving the\nway towards climate ca-tastrophe. Divestment sets\nan example for society\nto follow, and we can\napplaud the example our\nown Union set by voting\nto remove its funds from\nfossil fuels. College\u2019s\nreluctance to follow suit\nis scandalous, and it\u2019s\nup to us to force their\nhand. If we don\u2019t, we risk\nthrowing away all we\u2019ve\never known: the blue\nplanet we call home.\n\u201cA good first\nstep for the\nCollege would\nbe to remove\nits dirty\ninvestments\nin some of\nthe most\nunethical and\nunscientific\nindustries\u201d\nThe cruel irony of\nclimate change is that the\n\n"

Half of the remaining\nstaff have attended presentations about free legal\nsupport with around 220\nEU Imperial staff leaving following Brexit decision\npeople attending one-to-one advice sessions.\nHowever, she added:\n\u201cWe are still attracting\ntalent because we are a\ngreat and very international university and we\nintend to stay that way,\u201d\nciting the recruitment\nof Professor Francisco\nVeloso as dean of Imperial\nCollege Business School,\nand Professor Simone\nBuitendijk as Vice Provost\n(Education).\nDespite the challenges\nahead, Professor Gast\nremains hopeful about\nImperial\u2019s future in\npost-Brexit Britain.\n\u201cI am optimistic that\nthe value of the higher\neducation community is\nunderstood both in Europe\nand the UK and that will\nbe a motivation to negotiate good solutions to\nBrexit to maintain those\ncollaborations [with EU\nmember states]. We just\nhave to find the right way\nto get there,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe need to address the\nchallenges of talent mo-bility. It will come down\nto good immigration policies that will enable us to\nbring in talented people,\u201d\nshe added.\nbe conducted.\n\u201cWe intend to remain\nthe most international in-stitution. We do not want\nborder issues to jeopardize this situation. If there\nare border controls, we\nwill commit to always\ncollaborating with people\nof talent.\u201d she continued.\nProfessor Gast said\nresearch funded by the\nEU had been of \u201cgreat\nvalue\u201d to Imperial and\nthat it is essential these\ncollaborations continue.\nIn October last year, Professor Gast announced a\nEuropean Partners Fund\nworth \u00a3100,000 a year to\n\u201cdevelop collaborations\nin Europe which lead\nto new science and to\napplications for external\nfunding.\u201d\nOne quarter of Imperial\nstaff and one fifth of its\nstudents come from the\nEU. Their rights and\nprotections while living\nin the UK after Brexit are\nstill uncertain. Although\nprogress is understood to\nhave been made on the\nDivorce Bill and Irish\nborder, Britain\u2019s offers\nregarding the rights of\nEU citizens living in the\nUK post-Brexit have\nrepeatedly been rejected\nby the EU as not going far\nenough.\nof around \u00a3250,000\u00a3280,000. She has been\nat the centre of a controversial row over the past\nfew months surrounding\nthe \u201cexceptional\u201d salaries\npaid to vice-chancellors.\nAfter facing increasing\npressure from students\nand academics at Bath\nUniversity, Dame Glynis\nwill finish her tenure as\nvice-chancellor on the\n31st of November 2018.\nShe will then take a six\nmonth sabbatical, thus\ncontinuing to receive her\nfull salary until February\n2019. The university\nis also writing off her\ninterest-free \u00a331,000 car\nloan, which staff claim\nwas a benefit in kind\nrather than a loan. On top\nof this, Dame Glynis receives \u00a38,738 a year for a\nhousekeeper to look after\nher Georgian townhouse\n(another benefit in kind\nthat cost \u00a31.6 million) and\nhas claimed thousands\nof pounds in expenses,\nincluding \u00a32 for biscuits.\nEarlier this year, Labour\npeer and former education\nminister Lord (Andrew)\nAdonis said when all her\nassets were considered,\nDame Glynis \u201cis paid\nalmost exactly half a\nmillion pounds \u2013 more\nthan three times the prime\nminister\u2019s salary\u201d.\nAlthough many other\nvice-chancellors receive\nexceptionally high salaries\n\u2013 Imperial President Alice\nGast takes home \u00a3430,000\na year \u2013 attentions have\nfocused on Dame Glynis\nand Bath University due\nto their poor handling of\nthe situation.\nUntil October, Dame\nGlynis \u2013 like many\nvice-chancellors \u2013 sat on\nthe remuneration committee responsible for setting\nher salary. In the past academic year, Dame Glynis\nreceived a 3.9% pay rise,\nworth more than \u00a317,500.\nThe majority of Bath\nUniversity employees received pay rises of around\nA motion to censure the\nremunerations committee\nwas tabled at a university\ncouncil meeting in February.

Imperial\u2019s ranking is two places\nup from 2017, and seven\nplaces up from 2016.\nThe rankings place\nImperial 3rd\nbest in the\ncountry, behind the Universities of Cambridge\nand Oxford, which\nachieved global ranks of\n5th\nand 6th\nrespectively,\nwithin a top 20 dominated\nby American higher education providers.\nThe rankings are based\non metrics, including ci-tations, industry income,\nteaching, and research.\nImperial showed an increase across all metrics,\nmost significantly in\ninternational outlook and\ncitations.\nThe rankings provide\na contrast with a number\nof other subject-based\nleague tables, which highlighted issues with student\nsatisfaction. The most\nstriking of these were\nthe Guardian University\nLeague Tables, which\nplaced Imperial 18th\nin the\ncountry for Chemistry,\nand 30th\nfor Physics. For\nphysics, this was a sharp\ndrop from the previous\nyear\u2019s rankings, in which\nthey placed 8th\n.\nThis year physics also\nexperienced a small drop\nin the Complete University Guide\u2019s rankings, from\n3rd\nto 5th\n.\nThis discrepancy might\nbe explained by the methodology of the league\ntables: while the Guardian\nleague tables take student\nsatisfaction into account,\nthe THE league tables\ndo not \u2013 their score for\n\u2018teaching\u2019 is largely based\noff a survey sent out exclusively to academics.\nIn the Complete University Guide\u2019s rankings,\nImperial came bottom of\nall universities for physics\nin terms of student\nsatisfaction.\nEarlier this year, students in the Departments\nof Physics and Chemistry\nreported poor satisfaction\nrates in the annual National Student Survey (NSS),\nplacing last and second-to-last in rankings of\ndepartments at Imperial.\nPhysics did particularly\npoorly, with only 67% of\nstudents feeling satisfied\nwith their course, and\nissues with feedback and\nmarking highlighted.\nOverall, the rankings\nare dominated with American universities, with 115\ninstitutions in the top 500.\nAustralia and China have\nclimbed the rankings,\nwith 23 entries each.\nElsewhere, however,\ninstitutions in Germany,\nSouth Korea, and Canada\nhave slipped down the\nrankings.\nTHE takes into account\n13 performance indicators\nacross five categories \u2013\nthe same system used for\nits overall world rankings.\nHowever, while the world\nrankings place a higher\nemphasis on teaching and\nresearch, the scores for\nphysical sciences are more\nfocussed on the number\nof citations an institution\nreceives.\nairports and other restricted areas.\nPeter Zheng, a PhD\nstudent in Imperial\u2019s\nAerial Robotics Lab told\nFelix: \u201cThis new focus on\ngeo-fencing really does\nhelp enthusiasts keep\nthemselves safe, and keep\nother people safe.\n\u201cFor researchers, it\u2019s\nreally good to develop\ngeo-fencing technology\nand guidelines. This will\nhelp us be aware of where\nwe can safely test our\ntechnology; being aware\nof this helps us to be safe.\u201d\nThegovernmentalsorecently announced plans to\ncreate a registry of owners\nof drones weighing more\nthan 250g. These operators will also be required\nto take safety awareness\ntests. A collision with\na drone weighing 400g\nwould be sufficient to critically damage a helicopter\nwindscreen and a 2 kg\ndrone could have the same\neffect on airliners.\n\u201cThis law comes in\nat a good time, when\nthe UK is just starting to\nexplore commercial uses\nof drones,\u201d Zheng said.\n\u201cAll of the developments\naround the safety of\ndrones allow the public\nto be more engaged with\nthis community [of drone\nusers]. That\u2019s also good\nfor researchers: there\nwill be more exposure\nand people will be more\ninclined to use the technology.\u201d\nThe rising popularity\nof drones over recent\nyears has caused the\nnumber of near misses\nto double, with multiple\nincidents occurring each\nweek. Current regulations\nrequire drone operators to\nmaintain \u201cdirect unaided\nvisual contact\u201d with their\ndrones in order to prevent\ncollisions. Between\nJanuary and August 2017,\nthe Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s Airprox Board\ninvestigated more than 60\nincidents between drones\nand other aircraft.\nA large drone passed\nan Airbus A319 as it was\nlanding at Gatwick. The\nincident report said: \u201cA\nlarger aircraft might not\nhave missed it and in the\ncaptain\u2019s opinion it had\nput 130 lives at risk.\u201d\nIt is not just recreational drones that face\nproblems. In September\nthe British Army lost two\nreconnaissance drones\nthat crashed into the Irish\nSea. The drones were\npart of the Watchkeeper\nprogramme.

How\nwould you describe\nwhat you do?\nWell, they\u2019re all\ncrumpled hats, that\u2019s\nfor sure! I spend my\nmornings in the college\nand afternoons in Westminster, peppered with a\nlot of educational outreach\nthroughout the week.\nThe common thread\nhere is communica-tion. What is the role\nof science communicators in engaging\nwith the public?\nIt\u2019s a very good\nquestion. As a science\ncommunicator, you\u2019re\nalways at risk because\nyou\u2019re not necessarily\nan expert in the field that\nyou\u2019re communicating.\nBut the great thing about\nscience is that you can\nwork it out from first prin-ciples. For me, science\ncommunication is about\nconveying that science\noften isn\u2019t as difficult as\nit\u2019s perceived to be. In the\nbroader context of society,\npeople need to be able\nto make wise decisions\nwith respect to various\nissues. On, say, GM crops,\nCRISPR, and antibiotic\nresistance.\nCommunication is\none thing, but we\u2019re\nseeing a worrying in-creaseinevidencede-nial in our post-truth\nworld. How should\nwe combat this?\nIt\u2019s very easy when\nyou come from a place\nlike Imperial to think that\nyou\u2019re a \u2018master of the\nuniverse\u2019. But we need\nto be modest and humble\nwhen communicating\nwith the public. And to\nbe prepared to listen, not\njust talk. Knowledge itself\nlacks a moral dimension:\nthat dimension becomes\nrelevant once we start\nto harness knowledge,\nand that is a fundamental\nmessage that science\ncommunication should\nget across.\nYou\u2019ve previously\nsaid that \u201cabsolute\ncertainty in either science or religion can\nlead to serious problems\u201d. Why would absolute certainty in science be a bad thing?\nWe only have to look\nat Oppenheimer to see\nthat absolute certainty\nin science is a bad thing.\nWe have to be absolutely\nclear of what our ethical\nprinciples are. To borrow\na metaphor often used by\nreligion: we must respect\nthe sanctity of human\nlife. And that means\nrespecting the autonomy\nof individuals in a society.\nBoth religion \u2013 and\nscience \u2013 are dangerous\nwhen they\u2019re certain.\nYour Wohl Reach Out\nLab here at Imperial\nand Utterly Amazing\nbooks both target\nyounger audiences.\nIs there a reason you\nhave adopted this demographic as a strat-egy?\nWe are not going to\nreinvent science education\nat secondary school, and\nyounger brains are much\nmore plastic, much more\nopen to change. Eightyear-olds have no rules\nand often ask all sorts of\nquestions. We need to\nimprint good attitudes\nat a young age. That\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019ve concentrated on\nyounger audiences.\nCan you remember\na moment when you\nwere a part of this\nage group and felt inspired by science?\nI was about twelve\nyears old. Back in the 50s\nwe didn\u2019t do science until\nwe were much older. A\nboring old master stood\nin front of the class with\nhis hands behind his back,\nwittering on about chem-istry. It was utterly, devas-tatingly boring. But then\nthere was a monumental\nexplosion, and the entire\nroom was filled with\nsmoke. From that moment\non all we wanted to do\nwas make explosions! Of\ncourse nowadays we\u2019re\nmuch more reflective,\ntrying to incorporate the\nconcepts behind the fun\nand explosions.\nLet\u2019s finish with some\nquick-fire questions.\nWhat\u2019s your favourite\npiece of lab equip-ment?\nA simple light micro-scope. Once you have\nlooked down one at relatively low power you can\nsee the beauty of things\nthat you didn\u2019t dream\npossible. That was what\nreally hooked me into\nmy research. I remember\nbeing mesmerised by\nthe sight of the fallopian\ntube, and the exquisite\nbeauty of how the egg is\ntransported. It was the\nmicroscope that showed\nme that.\nWhat do you think\nabout the link between academia and\nbusiness?\nPeople like Musk are\ninspirational. Without him\nwe\u2019d be further behind in,\nsay, carbon-free transport.\nHe\u2019s changing the nature\nof the game.\nWhich area of research currently most\nexcites you?\nNeuroscience. The\nwhole notion of human\nconsciousness is of key\nimportance to biology,\nand to us. If we\u2019re really\ngoing into the realms of\nAI and machine learning,\nthen consciousness\nbecomes a very important\nthing to understand, and\nwe\u2019re still very primitive\nin our understanding.\nScience communication as a field is going from strength to\nstrength. Why is that?\nOne of the reasons why\nit\u2019s evolving is that we\u2019re\nbetter able to express our-selves. For instance, by\nhoning our ability to write\nwell, and in a way that is\nengaging. The Science\nChallenge is helping\npeople to do that, and I am\ndelighted to be involved\nwith it.\nLRW, best of luck with\nthe SciChal launch.\nThank you.\nI, for one, welcome our science communication overlords // Andy Miah\nSCIENCE\nChris Richardson\nScience Editor\nRCSU Science Challenge 2018: One small step, one\ngiant leap\n\u201cThe smallest\nof changes\ncan result in\nthe biggest of\nshifts\u201d\nRCSU Science Challenge Chair Ansh Bhatnagar explains why everyone should get involved in this year\u2019s\ncompetition.\nSCIENCE\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nScience Challenge Chair\nT\nhe Science\nChallenge is an\nannual science\ncommunication\ncompetition run by the\nRCSU. It is your chance\nto submit an entry communicating your passion\nfor science, and to win up\nto \u00a31000. Choose to enter\nin one of the four catego-ries, answering one of the\nquestions chosen by our\npanel of judges according\nto the theme. The theme\nfor this year, chosen with\nhelp of a student vote, is\n\u201cOne Small Step, One\nGiant Leap\u201d.\nWhile the theme obviously nods to the famous\nfirst words said on the\nMoon, it is also a metaphor\nfor what happens often in\nscience: that the smallest\nof changes can result\nin the biggest of shifts.\nIn almost every area of\nscience, there are countless examples of phenomena like this.\nConsider the structure\nof the universe \u2013 why\nare there regions of\nthe universe which are\nmore densely packed\nwith galaxy clusters\nthan other areas? Tiny\nfluctuations in energy\ndensity at the beginning\nof the universe were\n\u2018magnified\u2019 by inflation,\nand led to the large-scale\nstructure of the universe\nwe see today \u2013 entire\nregions more populated\nwith galaxy clusters than\nothers, simply because\nthose regions happened\ntive to small changes, such\nas those on our planet.\nClimate change presents\nmassive effects: a change\nin average air temperature\nof just 2\u00b0C is enough to\ncause large rises in sea\nlevels and vastly increase\nthe risk of major flooding\nthroughout the world, with\ndevastating consequences\nfor ecosystems.\nThe theme can also be\nextended to how seemingly small contributions\nto scientific research lead\nto milestone discoveries.\nFor example, Photograph\n51 is an X-Ray diffraction\nimage of DNA taken in\n1952 at Rosalind Franklin\u2019s King\u2019s College lab.\nWatson and Crick later\nused this image to deduce\nthe double-helical structure of DNA, providing a\nbreakthrough in biochem-istry. Without the small\nstep made by Franklin\u2019s\nlab, this giant leap in our\ninteresting questions,\nreminding us of the small,\nmeaningful things that go\non in science. Come along\nto the launch on Tuesday,\nwhere the judges will\nannounce their questions.\nThere will be scientific\ndemonstrations hosted\nby a variety of science\nsocieties, as well as free\nfood. Don\u2019t miss out\non the keynote speech,\nwhich will be delivered\nby Lord Robert Winston,\nthe Science Challenge\nAmbassador.\nYou have until 12pm on\nMonday 22nd\nof January\n2018 to submit an entry.\nVisit sciencechallenge.\norg for more information.\nto have a bit more energy\ndue to random primordial\nfluctuations.\nThis effect of the small\nrelating to the large is seen\nnot just in cosmology:\nthere are many systems\nthat are extremely sensi\u201cSeemingly\nsmall\ncontributions\nto science lead\nto milestone\ndiscoveries\u201d\nunderstanding of biology\nwould not have occurred.\n\u201cOne Small Step, One\nGiant Leap\u201d is a theme\nthat allows for judges to\ncome up with some truly\nPHOENIX\nImperial\u2019s arts magazine returns!\nWe are interested in: \u2022Poetry\n\u2022Prose\n\u2022Photography\n\u2022Fine arts\n\u2022And more...\nIf you\u2019re interested, please email phoenix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
