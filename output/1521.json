The low attendance (with 200 required to reach quorum)\nwas undoubtedly a combination of timing\n\u2013 with many still remaining in the midst\nof exams and revision \u2013 a general lack of\npublicity, and for want of a better word,\nhype.\nAs difficult as it might be to build up the\nenthusiasm at three weeks notice for 200\nstudents to argue it out over a range of\nissues, a significant number of students\nFelix took the time to question were unaware that the General Meeting was actually taking place on Wednesday.\nThis is not a huge surprise given the\nyear-on-year apathy that exists not only at\nImperial but at other universities across\nthe United Kingdom. What it is, however,\nis a shame, as the propositions brought\nforward are wide-ranging and are likely\nto change the Union significantly if they\ncome into action. The input from a wider\nrange of students is likely to be invaluable.\nThe points raised are definitely worth\nyour consideration. The Sabbatical Officer position of Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services) has the potential to be\nremoved, with the officers\u2019 current more\nadministrative-focused tasks being assigned to permanent staff and allowing\nthe new emergent role the task of overseeing .\nSabbatical Officers will potentially have\nthe opportunity to hold positions on the\nUnion\u2019s Trustee Board, which is the sovereign and governing body of the Union.\nIt acts as the Union\u2019s most powerful committee and is responsible for its ultimate\nobjectives and finances. It has been proposed that the addition of Sabbatical Officers will reduce the President\u2019s overall\npower, but what is your view on this?\nYou may see some aspects of the introduction of a Postgraduate Sabbatical, for\nexample, as necessary or unnecessary\naccordingly.\nThe points of discussion at the Union\nGeneral Meeting will now move to Union\nCouncil on Monday 11 June. If you have\nany opinion at all on the issues at hand, it\nis recommended that you raise any such\nopinion here, before the propositions are\neither passed or rejected. The meeting is\nopen to any student, and you have the potential at this meeting to make the difference in the future of the Union.\nUnion General Meeting\ngoes ahead. Were you\nthere?\nMaybe you don\u2019t want the monarchy to exist when it\u2019s his time to be King, but we can all\nagree that his hat is straight-up boss, just sayin\u2019...\n... a monarchy\nis born as\ninstitutionalised\nclass division,\nand even\nmangled and\ndiminished, many\nof its aspects are\nstill present\n\u201c\n... a m\n... a m\nis born\nis born\n\u201d\ncts are\ncts are\nt\nI\nf you\u2019ve been in the country for\nthe past month or so, you undoubtedly will have heard about\nthe Queen\u2019s Jubilee and the great\nfestivities that accompanied it.\nNational holiday, extended weekend,\nparades and lots of flag-waving to celebrate the monarch\u2019s sixty year reign.\nOne thing that I was taken aback by\nwas the scale of the whole thing; not\nby the lavishness and pomp, as I was\nexpecting that considering how proud\nand wealthy this kingdom is and has\nbeen, but rather by how much everyone participated in the affair. As the nation ground to a halt, Union Jacks were\nflown everywhere and thousands if not\nmillions gathered to celebrate across\nthe globe. Faraway, and otherwise un-related, countries covered the jubilee\nin great detail and everyone seemed to\nparticipate in wishing the Queen well.\nMy Facebook feed constantly showed\nmessages of support. My cynical side\nis quick to explain how this widespread\napproval might be motivated by the\nfour-day holiday, but that aside, the celebrations seemed very earnest.\nThe monarchy, it appears, is very\nbeloved. Not only does it still enjoy\nsupport, but it\u2019s thriving, if the popular\nparticipation in events such as the Jubilee and the Royal Marriage last year is\nof any indication; which is all the more\njarring considering how outdated as a\nconcept it is, and how it is a reminder\nof harsher times. The monarchies we\nhave today are the direct descendants\nof those that were born in the Middle\nAges or prior. The spirit of unwarranted\nsocial elitism that they embodied for\ncenturies is still present, though scaled\ndown, and they have survived cultural\nchanges that should have spelt the end\nof a ruling class decided by inheritance.\nBeing a king or queen or duke or emperor is, obviously, no longer the same\nit used be: most have no real power,\nand their only official duties consist of,\nmainly, waving to crowds and inaugurating buildings and such. But they are\nstill present: their prerogatives almost\nabolished, their role lessened, their\npower given to others, but they are still\nthere. Isn\u2019t this mostly ceremonial function a sign that monarchy is a relic of\nthe (bad) past, one who we cling to out\nof sheer tradition?\nLong gone is the age when being king\nactually meant something, when nations would go to war to avoid someone\nbeing crowned and the will of a monarch could make or unmake its country\u2019s fortunes; one can hardly argue in\nfavour of that state of affairs. A single\nindividual\u2019s whims and desires have\ncaused tragedies and conflicts more often than they have been beneficial, and\nit should be apparent that hereditary\nsuccession is a poor choice for heads\nof state; but once we realise that, why\ndo they still exist? Surely, the advent\nof republicanism and our progress as a\ncivilisation should have been the end of\nall kings, but not only do many countries still have monarchies, they are\nvery proud of it too.\nTradition, as already mentioned, is\nprobably the main reason behind this: I,\nmyself, am not insensible to the rich and\ninteresting history of the British Kingdom, but I still feel it belongs, because\nof this, in the history books. Monarchy,\nnot only as a form of government but\neven as an ideal, is outdated. In its modern vestigial form it is still a reminder\nof how, for centuries, the rights and prerogatives of few could trump and overrule those of many. The closely related\nconcept of aristocracy thrives with it,\ncreating a ruling class that derives its\npower from itself. And while, thank-fully, this has been vastly changed,\nthe idea still exists and permeates our\nculture. The celebrations for the jubilee\nare a reminder of how, despite massive\nsocial changes and greater equality, the\ngreatest honours are still reserved for\nthose born with the right set of parents.\nThere are other arguments against\nmonarchy. Notably the expense of\nmaintaining it \u2013 though I don\u2019t want to\ntouch upon that. The discussion would\nbe just a finicky number war, and I\u2019m\nnot convinced a republic would be significantly cheaper. I prefer to concentrate on the cultural impact of still having a monarch as head of state, which\nis at odds with the meritocracy that our\nsociety is supposed to be founded upon:\nit gives undue honour and power; it promotes an archaic vision of the country\nas an extension of the monarch, rather\nthan as a nation of citizens; it is a collection of old habits and traditions that\nno longer make sense in a modern con-text.\nWhile discussing this with friends, the\nprevailing sentiment was that \u201cthe monarchy doesn\u2019t actually do anything\u201d,\nand hence it is harmless to society; but\na monarchy is born as institutionalised\nclass division, and even mangled and\ndiminished, many of its aspects are still\npresent. That we still cheer and celebrate it shows how our culture hasn\u2019t\nmanaged to outgrow this anachronism.\nDid you\nknow that\nyou get an\nemail when\nsomeone\ncomments on\nyour article?\nClog up some\ninboxes \u2018just\nfor the bants\ninnit\u2019 by going over to\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 08 June 2012\n22\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM\nShut up and deal: Shirley M\nJ\nack Lemmon is in love. He runs to his apartment to declare his feelings to\nthe one lady who means everything to him. And there she is, sitting on his\ncouch, getting ready to play their card game. He says: \u201cI absolutely adore\nyou.\u201d How sweet... but her response? \u201cShut up and deal.\u201d And with those\nfour words, Shirley MacLaine puts an end to the perfect little Oscar-winning romantic-comedy offering from Billy Wilder. It was a line that was thought\nof last minute by the writers on-set. If this were any other film, the two would\nhave kissed and embraced. But with MacLaine\u2019s sassy Fran Kubelik, The Apartment finds a sweet and amusing end, bringing with it one of the most memorable\nquotes and scenes of cinema history. That was back in 1960; more than 50 years\non, MacLaine is still a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood; a much respected,\nhighly celebrated name. This is why on 7 June 2012, the American Film Institute\n(AFI) bestowed her its highest honour, the Life Achievement Award, and they\ncould not have picked a more deserving winner for the award. The ceremony\nitself carried with it a touch of cringing, cheesy drama, with MacLaine\u2019s co-stars\nand friends getting on stage to unload lavish praises and compliments towards the\nactress, but in the end it\u2019s the incredible title that counts, something no-one can\ntake away from the accomplished star. She is the 40th (and 7th female) recipient\nof this award, with past winners including Bette Davis, Lillian Gish, Barbara Stanwyck, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand and Meryl Streep. And in celebrating\nthis magnificent feat, Felix Film looks over the past few decades of MacLaine\u2019s\nwonderfully diverse career.\n1960s\nThe 60s got off to a fantastic start thanks to The Apartment (1960), the Best Picture winning rom-com which\npaired her with Hollywood\u2019s legendary leading man Jack Lemmon as well as its top director, Billy Wilder. She\nreceived her second Academy Award nomination for this role, and was the hot favourite to win Best Actress in\n1961. But she lost out to Elizabeth Taylor who had recently undergone surgery. MacLaine famously quipped\n\u201cI thought I would win for The Apartment, but then Elizabeth Taylor had a tracheotomy.\u201d Nevertheless she kept\nbusy with high-quality work such as The Children\u2019s Hour (1961) with Audrey Hepburn, and scored her third\nOscar nomination wth Irma La Douce (1963). The 60s also made way for her to dive into more comedic and\nmusical roles, participating in successful projects such as What a Way to Go! (1964), Gambit (1966), Woman\nTimes Seven (1967), and Sweet Charity (1969).\n1970s\nDuring the filming of Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), co-star Clint Eastwood described MacLaine as being \u201ctoo unfeminine\u201d having \u201ctoo much balls\u201d and \u201cvery, very hard.\u201d MacLaine wasn\u2019t exactly known as the\nconventional, beautiful leading lady type, but was more loved because of the strong, independent types of\nwomen she played. Her fourth Academy Award nomination however, came from an unexpected source, a\ndocumentary, directed and narrated by the actress, looking at mainland Chinese life. Desperate Characters\n(1971) won her the Best Actress Silver Bear gong at the Berlin Film Festival, with another Oscar nomination\nbeing added to her growing resume with her ballet drama The Turning Point (1977). In 1978 she was awarded\nthe Women in Film Crystal Awards, for her \u201cendurance and excellence of [her] work, that have helped expand\nthe role of women within the entertainment industry.\u201d\n1980s\nThe 80s included a highlight moment the actress had been waiting for. She finally won that Oscar. Almost 30\nyears after her first nomination, she finally got to get up on that stage and a make teary speech. Of course,\nthe role she deservedly won for was Terms of Endearment (1983). Her career continued to grow, avoiding\na post-Oscar slump, something many actors do often experience. She triumphed at the 1988 Venice Film\nFestival with Madame Sousatzka, winning the Best Actress Volpi Cup. She rounded off the 80s with her supporting gig in Steel Magnolias (1989), or better known as \u201cthat film that gave Julia Roberts the big push in\nHollywood.\u201d\n1990s\nIn 1990, she was paired up with Meryl Streep, playing her mother in Postcards from the Edge which proved\nto be a minor financial success. The 90s in general wasn\u2019t a financially lucrative period for MacLaine\u2019s films,\nnor did they receive much critical attention. She starred in many large ensemble dramas such as Used People\n(1992) with Kathy Bates, Marcia Gay Harden and Marcello Mastroianni, Wrestling with Hemingway (1993) with\nRobert Duvall, Richard Harris, Piper Laurie and Sandra Bullock, Guarding Tess (1994) with Nicolas Cage, and\nThe Evening Star (1996) with Bill Paxton, Juliette Lewis and Miranda Richardson.\n1950s\nNamed after the famous child actress Shirley Temple, MacLaine\u2019s film career began in 1955 with her starring\nrole in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Trouble with Harry. Even in her debut performance, she won rave reviews as\nwell as a handful of awards, including a BAFTA nomination and a Golden Globe win. 1956 saw her cast in the\nepically long (186 minutes), sumptuous ensemble epic Around the World in 80 Days, and by 1959, she had\nalready received her first Academy Award nomination for Some Came Running.\n2000s\nAfter her directorial feature film debut in 2000 (Bruno), MacLaine was mostly sought after for the funny,\nstraight-shooting, heavy-drinking, hot-tempered grandmother roles. Not at all complex and they do not exactly\nattract a lot of awards, but she brought a touch of class and unique energy to all of them, no matter how seemingly easy or trivial. Among her personal highlights (the films themselves are all distinctly average), there are:\nCarolina (2003), Rumour Has It (2005), Bewitched (2005), In Her Shoes (2005) and Closing the Ring (2007).\n2010s\nMacLaine, at almost 80 years old, continues to keep active in an industry that is more than forunate to have\nhad her over many, many years. She has had recent roles in films including Garry Marshall\u2019s over-stuffed\nmass-ensemble rom-com Valentine\u2019s Day (2010), and Bernie (2011), a hysterical black comedy that is yet to\nbe released in the UK.\n\n"

Unfortunately,\nI had to be up and at work early that\nmorning, so couldn\u2019t make it in to\nschool to find out my exact results or\njump into one of those coveted Guardian photographs (though I\u2019m sure I lack\nthe breasts and extra X chromosome to\nmeet their criteria, anyway).\nWhatever the specifics were, I\u2019d gotten in. That was enough to keep me\nbouncing through work all day until I\nwent to a pre-results party dinner at a\nfriend\u2019s house. Most of the room were\nthrilled with the outcome of the day,\nand heavily engrossed in wine and conversation about the mystery that was\nfreshers\u2019 week. Naturally, any questions fired at me were along the lines of\n\u201cisn\u2019t London really expensive?\u201d Sure,\nI said, but my na\u00efve eighteen year old\nself hadn\u2019t quite clocked just how much\nso.\nIt was then I got thinking about an\nold family friend called Paul. Paul was\na bit of a computer whizz, to say the\nleast, and back in the eighties he managed to secure himself a place studying Computer Science at Fitzwilliam,\nCambridge. This was down to pure academic merit: Paul was the first from a\nsmall town to make it out and do something special, but was also unfortunate\nenough to lack the financial support to\nThe importance of funded scholarships\nproperly fund his education. He basically spent his university days working\na full time job in tandem, dedicating\ncountless hours that could have been\nbetter spent on his course playing piano\nat an over-priced restaurant, and ended\nup narrowly missing out on a first.\nThankfully things have come a long\nway, with all of the elite universities\nnow offering some form of support for\nbrilliant minds that happen to be born\ninto less privileged financial circum-stances. I am currently the lucky recipient of awards from the college and a\nlarge bank, both of which are subject to\nsatisfactory academic performance, and\nboth of which make studying in London possible.\nThese awards have helped me to\npay for a multitude of things: the\nover-priced halls of residence where I\nmade most of my friends, the slightly\nless over-priced private accommodation when I moved out, enough food to\nkeep me healthy and well fed, and the\noccasional beer or two. Without these\nscholarships, accepting an offer from\nImperial would have been unrealistic.\nI still work a part time job, but thanks\nto the scholarships I am able to dedicate most of the time to my studies, and\nhopefully because of this I won\u2019t be in\nthe horrible situation of missing out on\na grade because I had to spend all of\nmy time making money. Imperial has\none of the highest intakes of privately-educated students in the country: in\naddition to helping with financing, the\nscholarships have also helped me to\nblend in socially, providing I avoid the\nlikes of Amikahikibargovida (although\nthey play terrible music anyway).\nI\u2019m sure that I\u2019m not alone: several\nof my friends are in the same position,\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of other people that I haven\u2019t met or who haven\u2019t\nmentioned it. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all agree\nthat scholarships are an important thing\nwith endless benefits to the recipients,\nand that we\u2019d want incoming students\nto have similar, or better, experiences\nlike those we\u2019ve been lucky to have.\nFor these reasons, I am asking that\nanyone on a scholarship, or anyone who\nunderstands their importance, to donate\nto The Skeleton Fund. Every penny will\ngo the Rector\u2019s Scholarship Fund, and\nwill directly help undergraduates and\npostgraduates to afford university. Donating a small amount of money won\u2019t\nbreak your bank, but will demonstrate\nto the college just how important such\nawards are, and ultimately the accumulated money will create a fantastic opportunity for worthy recipients in the\nfuture.\nDisclaimer: the writer of this article\nworks for Felix, but is not associated\nwith the Skeleton Fund and wished to\nremain anonymous.\nI still work a part\ntime job, but\nthanks to the\nscholarships I am\nable to dedicate\nmost of my time\nto my studies\n\u201c\nI still w\nI still w\ntime jo\ntime jo\n\u201d\ntime\ntime\nes\nes\nAnonymous\nDisappointingly, they transfer the money into your account, and don\u2019t just give\nit to you in a massive pile. Think of all the rap videos you could make...\nHelping to raise a latte for equality\nF\nirst off, I\u2019m not a natural coffee drinker. Fair enough, unless your mother had a very\npeculiar physiology while\nbreast-feeding, none of us\nare natural coffee drinkers. My point\nis, if given a choice, I would rather pick\na pot of peppermint tea than choose a\ncafetiere of cappuccino. This puts me in\na very adversarial relationship with the\nvarious coffee-shop chains on the high\nstreet. First among equals in my derision of them is Starbucks.\nEverything about it irritates me. First\noff, there\u2019s the price. For me, coffee\nshould be something cheap and con-venient. I shouldn\u2019t need to take out\na bank loan of such magnitude that it\nwould be better spent on Greece than\na cup of coffee. Next, there\u2019s the sizing scale; \u2018tall\u2019, \u2018grande\u2019 and \u2018venti\u2019.\nIn what universe is \u2018tall\u2019 the smallest\npossible measurement? Furthermore,\n\u2018tall\u2019is a misnomer \u2013 \u2018squat\u2019would be a\nmore accurate for that size. At the other\nend of the bizarrely gradated spectrum,\nthe largest cup size, something in America called \u2018trenta\u2019, holds more coffee\nthan a bottle of wine. With caffeine and\nsugar in those quantities, it\u2019s even odds\nwhether a heart attack or diabetes will\nkill you first.\nI will allow for the endless variations\nof coffee. As I know from my tea-drink-ing habits, there is a certain satisfaction\nthat comes with having a certain blend\nfor every possible situation. What I cannot abide, however, is how they ask for\nyour name to inscribe upon your ridiculously over-sized coffee cup. I\u2019m just\nbuying coffee, Starbucks, let\u2019s not make\nthis personal. I\u2019m all for service with a\nsmile but that is taking it too far. Asking\nfor a name is just one step away from\ngetting your entire life history and moving in together with the barista. There\nis an added rub if, like me, you have a\nname that needs spelling out every time.\nHowever, in spite of all of this, recently I have had cause to change my\ntune. I still dislike Starbucks but I have\ncome to support them. Earlier this year,\nback in March, Starbucks publically\ncame out in support of a gay marriage\nlaw in Washington state, USA. Swell,\nbut what goes on behind closed doors\nsix thousand miles away, and what a\ncoffee-shop thinks about it, is not really\nany of my concern.\nAmerica is a funny country. People\nthere are really interested in things like\nmarriage. Concerned by Starbuck\u2019s\nstance on a topic that will surely be the\nend of civilisation as we know it (or\nmaybe happiness for a few fabulous\npeople), the National Organisation for\nMarriage called for a worldwide boycott of Starbucks. They want to show\nthe coffee chain that the patronage of\ntens of thousands right(-wing) minded\ncustomers is worth more to them than a\nstance they disapprove of.\nIf this played out on the playground,\nNOM would be saying something like,\n\u201cYou like gay marriage? That\u2019s so gay!\nI don\u2019t like you. I\u2019m not going to talk to\nyou until you change your mind.\u201d before pushing Starbucks over and stomping off.\nThat sounds childish. Probably because it is. The internet, being the\nliberal, hedonistic kingdom that it is,\npromptly launched an informal coun-ter-boycott. SumOfUs set up an online\nthank you card to Starbucks. To go back\nto the playground allegory, they are the\nkid who goes over and helps Starbucks\nback up.\nThis is where I got interested. I am a\nfirm believer in that the enemy of my\nenemy is my friend. Starbucks is supporting equality, or something like it.\nSome people don\u2019t like that, and would\nrather I drink coffee elsewhere. I may\nnot like Starbucks but I like bigots even\nless. I can derive a smug sense of satisfaction if, by drinking a tall and skinny\nFrappuccino, I annoy a self-righteous\nhomophobe somewhere in the world.\nSo raise a latte for equality!\nRhys Davies\n\n"

There are some other\nexciting projects planned in the near\nfuture, but I\u2019m unable to talk about\nthem yet, and there are also some remixes remaining to be achieved!\nMy other wish is having some mer-ch as well like t-shirts, posters, bags\netc\u2026 but that will be the next step.

Or what you do\nwant people to feel when they listen\nto your music?\nI really hope people enjoy listening to\nmy music. I hope it captures a special\nmoment, a moment that they can recall\nfondly in the future. It\u2019s inspiring when\npeople write to me and tell me that my\nmusic has helped them get through bad\nmoments or that my music encouraged\nthem to be creative, by doing their own\nmusic, or making paintings for exam-ple. That\u2019s one of the biggest rewards\nwhen making music.\nWhat is the worst thing about making music? And the best?\nIf there is a negative aspect to making\nmusic, it has to be deadlines or reaching a point where you aren\u2019t happy\nwith the results you\u2019ve created\u2026\nThe best thing about making music is\nthe creative process for sure. Trying to\nmake new sounds or songs and playing\nlive and hanging around with people\nwho enjoy your music.\nWhat\u2019s your proudest achievement?\nI feel I\u2019ve achieved a lot, but everything could be fine is surely my best\nwork ever! I still listen to these tracks\nand enjoy them as much as I did the\nfirst day they were recorded. That\u2019s a\ngood sign for me. But I\u2019m also proud\nof my very first EP when I started\nmaking electronic music, called in2\nthe skies. I\u2019m pleased with two other\nT\nell us a bit about your-self. Did you grow up\nin a musical household?\nWhat kind of music did\nyou listen to growing\nup?\nMy name is Victor Ferreira and I compose and perform under the moniker,\nSun Glitters. I was born in Luxembourg in 1973 and sadly I didn\u2019t really\ngrow in a musical household\u2026\nI remember my first record was a\n12\u201d, a Hit Connection Compilation\nwith artists like Billy Ocean, Pia\nZadorra, Michael Jackson, Duran\nDuran, etc\u2026 It wasn\u2019t until later on\nthat I grew to like music by The Cure,\nMy Bloody Valentine and bands like\nthat...\nHow did you start making music?\nI started playing bass in rock bands.\nI then discovered artists like Portishead, Massive Attack, Third Eye\nFoundation, and Boards Of Canada,\nwho brought about a new fascination\nwith electronic music. That\u2019s when I\npurchased my first Groovebox\u2026\nI also have fond memories of rapping and making hip-hop when I was\nyounger\u2026 I first approached my sampling technique when I bought a sam-pler; it was after this that I started making melodies with a guitar and a bass.\nIs Sun Glitters your first project or\nwere there others before?\nLike I mentioned before, I started\nplaying bass in several rock bands. I\nwas also involved in electronic projects including a duo called stereOner-ic and another personal project called\nsug(r)cane...\nYou don\u2019t only make music \u2013 it\nseems you also do your own artwork.\nWhat\u2019s the benefit of having direct\ncreative control over all aspects of\nyour music?\nI worked with a small company as a\ngraphic designer. Ever since I was\nyoung I\u2019ve enjoyed drawing illustrating and creating handmade flyers, for\nexample. I work under the artist name\nmadebyjujo, and you can find my\nstuff at www.madebyhujo.com. Later\non, I started to take photos which I\u2019ve\nincorporated into the artwork for Sun\nGlitters. I felt it was important to create a visual identity to run side-by-side\nwith the music.\nWhich musicians inspire you and\nwho are you listening to at the mo-ment?\nSun Glitters flies over for the Felix Music Night\nKadhim Shubber talks with the Luxembourger ahead of his appearance at Diggidy Dawg next Saturday\nterested people, get in touch with me!\nAngela Merkel phones you up and\nsays, \u201cVictor, we need you to save\nthe Euro with music. What songs do\nyou play?\u201d\nHaha, maybe \u2018too much to lose\u2019 and\n\u2018everything could be fine\u2019 ;)\nYou\u2019re at a bakery in London, about\nto buy a pasty. You can have it piping hot, slightly warm, or room tem-perature. Which is cheapest?\nI would choose slightly warm...\nYou\u2019re asked to perform at the\nopening ceremony of the Olympics,\nbut as you go on stage you notice\nthe absent-minded organisers have\nfailed to provide you with any in-struments. What do you do?\nI just felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! Not at the\nOlympics, mind you. It wouldn\u2019t be\nthe first time that I arrived in a venue\nand that they forgot something that\nwas included in my tech rider, haha\nSo, I would stay calm and try to solve\nthe problem as best as I could\u2026 I think\nas long as I had my laptop, everything\nwould be okay, and I would just make\nit work.\nBut if I was forced to be a bit more\ncreative for the situation, then I would\ntake the microphone and sing, mimicking the missing instruments the best\nI could!\nDid he fall asleep on those flowers or is he just hiding behind them?

With that logic, we can say\nit took almost 15 years for this new\nentry to hit the screens after the Will\nSmith-Tommy Lee Jones alien-fighting\nduo saved the world all the way back\nin 1997. So who remembers what this\nfranchise is really about? As the title\ngives it away, Smith and Jones are men\nin black suits, a part of a top-secret government organisation that hunts down\nharmful extraterrestrial life forms.\nThey have laser guns, fast cars, and all\nsorts of gadgets that accompany them\non their missions. It\u2019s also been far too\nlong since we\u2019ve seen Smith on the big\nscreen. He\u2019s been keeping himself busy\nwith film-producing work, but time actually spent on screen has been absolute\nzero for past four years or so.\nAnd what a welcome back to form\nthis turns out to be. Which is odd, since\nwe see so little of the series-defining\nand utterly necessary Jones who even\nin his brief outing delivers the laughs\nwith his comically wise words and still,\nemotionless face, a quality Smith\u2019s\nAgent J has always had trouble adjusting to. The reason for Jones\u2019 shortage is\nbecause of an evil alien called Boris the\nAnimal (Jermaine Clement) who escapes from a maximum-security prison\non the Moon. Out to exact revenge on\nAgent K (Jones) who arrested him in\nthe first place, Boris decides to rewrite\nhistory, jump into the past, and permanently wipe K out. It takes a while for\nJ to understand and accept that within\na single day no-one knows or remembers who K is. To fix this complex situation he himself travels back into 1969\nto make sure K stays alive to save the\nworld once more.\nThe trouble with having time travel in\nfilms is that it can seriously get out of\nhand. But apart from a lazy mishap in\nthe film\u2019s climax, the adventurous idea\nstays well on track and provides a secure and fun base for the film to build\nitself around. So J travels to the 60s,\nwhen Americans were less than kind\nto people of his race. He drives a fancy\ncar, wears his black suit, and suddenly\nthe police come around thinking that\nhe stole these. Various culture shocks\naside, J is even more stunned to meet\nthe young K, played by Josh Brolin.\nBrolin is the reason why this film\nworks so well. Men in Black was never only about the disgusting looking\nRoger Moore in Moonraker... oh\nJohn Park\nDirector Ridley Scott\nScreenwriters Jon Spaihts, Damon\nLindelof\nCast Noomi Rapace, Logan\nMarshall-Green, Charlize Theron,\nMichael Fassbender, Guy Pearce\nPrometheus\naliens. It was mainly concerned with\ntip-top banterous chemistry Smith and\nJones, a highly unlikely pairing, shared.\nThe cocky, mouthy Smith teamed with\nthe serious, quiet Jones always provided\nthe laughs. With Jones gone, the shoes\nto fill must have been absolutely enor-mous, and to perfectly master Jones\u2019\nmannerisms and have an equally dynamic spark with Smith is Brolin. It\nhelps that Brolin and Jones look rather\nsimilar. But what Brolin achieves goes\nso far beyond superficial looks. He nails\nthe accent, the facial expressions, and\nwith them creates a fascinating younger\nversion of K.\nWith Flight of the Conchords\u2019 Clement in an almost unrecognisable form\nas the grumpy Boris, the villain looks\nand sounds deadly enough to warrant\nour attention. His size, brute force and\ndialogue seem deliberately absurd, as\nis the CGI used to portray every single aspect of his body with repulsive\nalien-like features. With this type of\nsimple, straightforward and completely\ncomprehensible villain, the threats he\nmakes are more than convincing, and\nas we see a glimpse of what he is planning for Earth in which giant squid-like\nalien vessels take over everything, it\u2019s\neasy to see this guy doesn\u2019t make empty threats he cannot deliver.\nDespite the determination of our vil-lain, the action remains relatively calm\nthroughout and there are no stand-out,\ncomplex sequences of heavy gun-fire.\nThe futuristic rides and silver firearms\nare all there, but the episodic, police\nprocedural type of pacing adds no creativity or originality to the duo\u2019s chase\nfor Boris. The ambitious final action\nsequence that combines the real-life account of America\u2019s first rocket launch\ninto space as well as the fictitious fight\nagainst aliens carried out by J and K is\nwell integrated and the aforementioned\nhuge misstep that conveniently but not\nlogically sums everything up is the only\naspect that threatens to ruin a perfectly\nwell set-up conclusion.\nSurprisingly, this third installment\nends with heart, and an unexpectedly\ntouching revelation that gives an enriching background story to both J and\nK in a short period of time that pulls\noff the emotional punch without ever\ngoing overboard or dragging out the\ndrama; again, a bold, unconventional\naddition to a film franchise with a set\nof rules that had already worked. With\njust enough tweaks but leaving a lot of\nthe good material intact, Men in Black\nIII is certainly a sci-fi adventure to embark on, something that shows there\nis no slowing down The Fresh Prince\nno matter after how many years of ab-sence, and that with the right casting\nchoices, a sudden replacement is not\nalways a disaster. She\u2019s playing with fire... again...\nPrometheus is the name of a spaceship carrying 17 crew members, out\nto explore a new planet. The reason?\nCuriosity. Nosy scientists just need to\nfind out who our makers are and solve\nthe mysteries surrounding our creation.\nWhere do we come from? Who we\nare? These are just some are the questions Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) must\nhave answered. After discovering a star\nmap made by seemingly unconnected\nancient cultures all over the world, she\nand her expedition partner Charlie Holloway (Marshall-Green) conclude that\nthis is an invitation for the humans to\nventure out and find their ancestors \u2013 or\nmakers.\nThe year is 2093, and with secure financial backing from a shadowy company known as the Weyland Corporation,\nPrometheus lands. Awakened from their\ntwo-year hyper-sleep, the ship\u2019s crew\nare informed of their mission: to explore\nand investigate this new terrain and\npossibly make contact with any alien\nlife-forms, which they dub \u201cEngineers.\u201d\nThe icy cold Meredith Vickers (Theron)\nis very clear on a couple of points: everything should be reported back to\nher with no direct contact to be made\nwith anything the team may find. And\noff they go, into a dark, damp, metallic\nstructure that no sane person would dare\nenter. What do they find? Dead bodies,\npresumably of one of their \u201cEngineers.\u201d\nGooey substances, haunting statues, vicious snake-like creatures... it\u2019s only a\nmatter of time until this chaotic expedition ends in sweat, tears and blood.\nLet\u2019s put one rumour to rest. Is this a\nprequel to Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien? Yes, it\nsure is. But do you need to be familiar\nwith the Alien franchise to enjoy the\nfilm? Absolutely not. Prometheus stands\nproudly on its own, and never relies on\ndirector Scott\u2019s previous sci-fi outing for\nany of the film\u2019s concepts. Most obvi-ously, Prometheus deals on a much big-ger, more ambitious scale.\nLong gone are Alien\u2019s narrow corri-dors, sharp corners, and claustrophobic\ncamera angles. Instead we have a series\nof expensive looking sets and tons of\nfancy technology that give this film a\nwhole new spin from what the audience\nmay have experienced with Alien. The\nupside of this is that whatever Scott decides to show on the screen, everything\nlooks marvellous, and the technical\ncrew have definitely outdone themselves\ncreating such gigantic stages for the actors to work on. The downside however,\nis that much of the anticipated horror\nhas gone mute. The more dimension\nthis adds, the less effective the scares\nbecome. A lot of tension is lost in how\nmuch we are shown in the beginning,\nand anyone expecting a full-on horror\nfilm is bound to be disappointed.\nDespite the many characters, the only\nones that require your attention are\nRapace\u2019s Shaw, Marshall-Green\u2019s Holloway, Theron\u2019s Vickers, and Michael\nFassbender\u2019s David, the android. Other\nthan that, the rest of the cast is merely\nthere to be slain and to be served up as\nbody parts for the bad guys to mutilate.\nOne by one they fall, and at times, this\ntragically feels like yet another violent\nslasher horror in which the separated\nmembers from the group have absolutely no chance of survival.\nSo thank goodness for Fassbender,\nwho really gives the highlight performance of the film. He plays David, a\nloyal and smart android. But it\u2019s difficult\nto tell just what may be on his mind.\nWho controls him? The company does,\npresumably. But does he have thoughts\nof his own? Technically, he shouldn\u2019t,\nand from what we see early on, he\nseems quiet and innocent enough, dutifully carrying out his orders. But in his\ninquisitive eyes, he appears to be more\ncomplex and devious. He seems to be\nthinking too much for someone acting\nas the ship\u2019s servant, and throughout the\nfilm, he does make questionable moves\nthat have us doubting his true nature.\nThis is what Fassbender precisely right\nthrough his charming yet disturbing\nperformance. He\u2019s sweet natured yet\nthere is something undeniably creepy\nabout his stares.\nRapace, although not quite the Ellen\nRipley sci-fi warrior queen, is on top\nform as the conflicted religious scientist.\nTheron, so cold and distant to the point\nwhere even a crewmember wonders\nwhether she is a robot or not, hovers and\nlingers in the background with sinister\nexpression, suggesting concealed agen-das.\nThe script is wordy, with dialogue\nused mostly for explaining the details\nand purpose behind this mission, and\nis a touch too slow to get started. The\nopening sequence, in which several\naerial shots of beautiful landscapes are\nsewn together, is impressive, but with\nScott\u2019s seemingly self-indulgent ways\nand laboured pace, there are several\npoints in which the film loses its way,\nfocusing far too much on looking good\nand not enough on its individual actors.\nBut in the end, boasting an unbelievably\nhuge scale and a talented cast does deliver a memorable experience. It\u2019s lasting legacy, however, is unlikely to reach\nthe highest pinnacle of Scott\u2019s career.\nFILM\nFELIX Friday 08 JUNE 2012 21\n\n"

Roughly 20 attended. The\nmeeting took thus took the form of\nan informal discussion, with all considered motions to be put forward to\nCouncil, after all of the motions were\nmet with general approval for those in\nattendance.\nThere were several proposed changes to the way the Union is run. The\nfirst proposition would place Sabbatical Officers on the Union\u2019s Trustee\nBoard, which is responsible for the\nstrategic overview of the Union\u2019s fi-nances, objectives and strategy. The\nreasoning behind this was that the Officers are \u201cmost in the know\u201d about\nthe way the Union is run, with the additional claim that such a move would\n\u201cdecrease the power of the President\u201d.\nThe President is currently the only\nperson on the board.\nIt was also proposed that two student trustees would be elected and two\nwould be appointed rather than the\ncurrent election of all four. This was\nsaid to \u201ceven up the representation,\u201d\nMatthew Colvin\ncampaign. The Member of Parliament\nfor Hammersmith, Andy Slaughter,\nhas also written a letter to the Borough\u2019s planning department in March\nbeing highly critical of the plans, saying many of the buildings proposed in\nthe plans \u201cwill be an oppressive presence in a neighbourhood of traditional\ntwo-storey houses in a conservation\narea\u201d. This is in addition to a report by\nthe Royal Borough of Kensington and\nChelsea, who objected to the \u201cheight,\nbulk and design\u201d of three of the proposed buildings (including a 35 storey\ntower).\nThis delay only affects \u201cPhase 2\u201d of\nthe Imperial West project, which includes teaching and research facilities.\n\u201cPhase 1\u201d, which consists of postgraduate accommodation and demolition\nof the existing BBC buildings, has already been approved, and construction\nis expected to complete in August.\nA new date for the planning committee meeting to discuss the proposals\nhas not yet been set, but a date of 10\nJuly is the earliest possible that one can\noccur.\n\u201c[Imperial West] will\nbe an oppressive\npresence\u201d\nImperial West continues to face\nopposition from residents\nResidents have objected to the potential view of a 35 storey tower\n...Continued from Front Page\nshepherds-bush.blogspot.com\nThe meeting took the form of an informal discussion\nas some faculties are currently underrepresented on the Trustee Board.\nThe restructuring and reshaping the\nSabbatical Officer roles was also con-sidered, with the current position of\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nbeing renamed as Deputy President\n(Activities), under the remit of handling Clubs and Societies and their\nofficers. The most substantial change\ncame with the removal of Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) and\nthe potential introduction of Deputy\nPresident (Student Development),\nwho would handle volunteering, fundraising and student citizenship. The\nintroduction of a Postgraduate Sabbatical officer was also met with unanimous approval.\nOne proposition considered the\nelection process in the Union, following controversies over the running of\nthis year\u2019s Big Elections. The Returning Officer was proposed to become\nan external individual with no connection to the Union. It was also proposed that seconders be removed from\nthe election process, with the reasoning for this being given that they are\na \u201cbarrier\u201d to elections, particularly\npostgraduates. It was touched upon\nthat seconders have the potential to\nprevent \u2018joke candidates\u2019 from stand-ing, but it was decided that the voters themselves choose who is the best\ncandidate for the job \u201cby voting them\nin.\u201d It was also claimed that this method has been proven to work in other\nUnions across the country. Union\nCouncil has previously rejected the\nidea of lowering the number of sec-onders required.\nTim Arbabzadah\nMatthew Colvin\nBlackboard Learn set for Imperial\nMatthew Colvin\nImperial College\u2019s virtual learning environment (VLE) is set to undergo an\noverhaul in time for next September, following a two year process to determine a\nsuccessor for the College\u2019s current VLE.\nThe new system, known as Blackboard\nLearn, was decided upon by a working\ngroup established in order to replace the\ncurrent Blackboard CE8, which is set to\nbe unsupported by education technology\ncompany Blackboard itself, and which\nhas, by their own admission, \u201cbecome\nquite dated\u201d. The VLE Review Working\nGroup was established by the E-learning\nStrategy Committee in February 2010.\nDuring 2010, an extensive consultation\nprocess with students and staff was un-dertaken, leading to a a specification of\nrequirements for the replacement VLE.A\nshortlist was drawn up, with four systems\nput forward for consideration.\nTwo of these were proprietary (Black-board Learn and Desire2Learn) and\ntwo open source systems (Moodle and\nSakai). Representatives from these services were invited to provide a demonstration and answer questions from Imperial. Following this, Moodle and Sakai\nwere eliminated from the process, with\npilot programs of the remaining systems\norganised.\nThe pilot phase for the shortlisted systems ran from September 2011 to March\n2012, including staff and students across\nCollege. The working group reviewed\nthe results of the scheme, identifying\nany potential \u201cshowstoppers\u201d, or items\nthat would stop people from using a particular VLE. Neither VLE emerged as\nan outright winner, however after taking\ninto consideration additional costs for\nrunning Desire2Learn, the group admitted that it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to justify\na move to this system given the lack of\nclear cross-faculty support.\nThe working group ultimately recommended Blackboard Learn as the new\nCollege VLE, with the additional suggestion of College \u2018keeping an eye\u2019 on the\nemergence of new cloud-based VLEs.\nDeputy President (Education) Jason\nParmar, who sits on the E-learning Strategy Committee, commented on the relationship between the current Blackboard\nsystem and Blackboard Learn: \u201cIt\u2019s quite\nimportant to note that these are two completely different systems \u2013 the only thing\nthey have in common being the name.\n[The new system] might as well be called\nWhiteBoard.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cI would like to thank\nthe Working Group for their extensive\nstudent consultation throughout the entire process, most notably through myself\nand the previous two Deputy President\n(Education)\u2019s (Alex Dahinten and Jonathan Silver) as well as usability testing\nwith students whereby students were\ngiven the opportunity to test and score\nthe two piloted systems\u201d.\nBlackboard Learn will provide new\nfunctions such as a built-in wiki. It was\npraised during the pilot program for its\ndesign and layout, and its comparative\nease of handling to Blackboard CE8. A\nlaunch scheduled for September 2012,\nand implementation will progress from\nthis point onwards.\n\n"

For DJs it was\nfine, and for band nights it was okay,\nand in the last few years the Union\u2019s\nmulti-million redevelopment has\nseen it transform into Metric, but I\u2019m\nnot convinced it\u2019s living up to its full\npotential.\nThe Union has a good history of\nattracting some big names. Previous\nSummer Balls have included the Noisettes, Chase and Status, Plan B, and\nLaura Marling. We\u2019ve had Pendulum, the New Young Pony Club, and\nif you go back far enough and add a\npinch of salt, even Queen! Big Union\nevents have come hand-in-hand with\nbig names (sometimes adding to the\nfinancial failure), and there are a\nhandful of student organised nights\nthroughout the term, but where is the\nmiddle ground?\nYou might ask whether there is\na desire for live bands at Imperial,\nwith many people choosing to avoid\nthe Union for their nights out, instead favouring the plethora of other clubs out in London. But decent\nbands have so much more to offer\nthan that particular DJ\u2019s latest music\nfad, played to the max in a room so\ndark you can\u2019t see whether it\u2019s your\nsnakebite or someone else\u2019s drink\nthat you\u2019ve spilt until you slip on the\npolished concrete floor and it seeps\ninto the newly formed crack in your\nhead. The atmosphere in a packed out\nMetric and diversity of music from\na good selection of bands is sure to\ntickle everyone\u2019s fancy, it may not\nbe your favourite \u2018take your bra off\nand attempt to make love to them on-Reaching Metric\u2019s full potential\nstage\u2019 boy band group but would you\nexpect that at Imperial (and would\nyou want it?). Last year\u2019s Summer\nBall proved that people aren\u2019t willing\nto pay through the nose for their own\nmini private festival, but surely there\nmust be a happy medium where it\u2019s\naffordable and enjoyable?\nBut there\u2019s more to live entertainments than your standard five-piece\nband. Once upon a time, back in\n2010, Isy Suttie (aka \u201cDobby\u201d from\nPeep Show) did her stand-up show\nto a packed dB\u2019s, her intriguing mix\nof acoustic musical stand-up was\npopular, witty, and went down well\namongst the crowd. But to my knowl-edge, this hasn\u2019t been tested out in\nour new venue, the basement feel of\nMetric surely must make it ideal for\nstand-up, hell why not combine comedy and live music?\nIt\u2019s unfortunate than Metric suffers\nfrom the building it\u2019s surrounded by,\nthe irregular narrowing at the Western\nend forces the stage to be abnormally\nsmall, smaller than its predecessor,\nthe PA design has had its teething\nproblems but it\u2019s still a vast improvement on its former self. However, it\u2019s\nstill very possible to run successful\nevents, as proved by Jazz & Rock,\nwho run regular Jam Nights, Felix\nMusic Nights, and Guitar Soc, who\nhost Open-Mic nights, but these very\nsuccessful events are still relatively\nad hoc, the booking process is hazy\nand fraught with obstacles, and limited to particular slots (We Are Metric:\nThursday & Saturday).\nIn my mind, the irony is that Metric was supposed to be better for this,\nit was supposed to be an improve-ment! During Metric\u2019s construction\nI remember conversations with the\nthen Union General Manager were so\nhopeful towards a bright and happy\nfuture for Metric, with named and upcoming bands performing regularly\nand students contributing towards its\nsuccess. That vision of building up a\nvibrant live music scene at Imperial\nseems a long way off, building up a\nfan base and interested clientele can\nbe difficult, but many of the student\nrun events have been recently born\nand continue to thrive.\nOne might argue that there is a financial risk from hiring in bands, and\nwhile true it is worth remembering\nthat the costs of renovating Metric\nstill needs to be recouped over the\ncoming years; large festival headline\nacts probably aren\u2019t going to make it\ntheir new home, but we can\u2019t compete\nwith that so why would we try? Students want to come to the Union for\na cheap, fun night out, but the same\nthing each week will only attract people who just want to get bladdered in\na dark room (I\u2019ve done this, but not\nweekly); the Union seems stuck in\nits old ways still, and I think variety\nwould get profits.\nThe student input into Metric so\nMetric, metric. Geddit. Geddit. Geddit? It\u2019s a visual pun. What? It\u2019s been a\nlong week in the Felix dungeon\nIn my mind,\nthe irony is\nthat Metric was\nsupposed to be\nbetter... it was\nsupposed to be\nan improvement\n[of dB\u2019s]\n\u201d\nment\nment\n\u201c\nIn my m\nIn my\nthe iro\nthe iro\nfar seems to be on the up, and events\nsuch as \u2018Heal These Wounds\u2019 Album\nLaunch and \u2018Diggidy Dawg\u2019 Felix\nMusic Night are on over the next\ntwo weekends, and Summer Ball,\nthe biggest event of the year, soon\nafter. So why can\u2019t all these great\nevents and proven ideas be brought\ntogether into an accessible and well\nadvertised Friday/Saturday night music scene, mixing acoustic, comedy,\nlive bands, open-mic, and then the\nclassic cheese/drum and bass/dub-step/trance... Why shouldn\u2019t there be\nsomething good on at the Union every week; that was what was meant to\nbe! Something to tease in the punters\nto spend even more of their precious\npennies on lemonades and ice teas,\nscrape back some of the recent losses\nand provide top-notch entertainment\nat the same time.\nCat got your tongue?\nRendezvous, with me, the Library, say 2 (am) and we can go through any\nnotes you want me to. Tonight will be the night. When you close your eyes,\ntake a minute, take a moment, realise, do you understand maths?\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 08 June 2012\nJohn Winters\n\n"

Alex Smith\nat \u2018left back\u2019 (in inverted commas because rarely would you find him anywhere or the left side of the pitch let\nalone at the back) could be found causing mayhem all over the place, scoring more goals than the strikers. A dynamic trio of captain Mateusz Zarucki,\nTaha Butt and the ever-angry Myles\nJarvis began to command the midfield\nand combine towards not only a number of goals for themselves, but also\nset-up the likes of Matt Pike or Nicusor Popescu playing up front. With\neverything going considerably better\nthan the first, the Hornets managed to\nnet themselves several victories. The\nhighlight being a 9-2 win in an Evelyn\nGardens derby against Fisher Hall FC,\nin which defender Alex Coney demonstrated his fantastic ability to stop a\nball using his face.\nQuarter-final\nSouthwell ended the regular season in\n4th position overall, landing them a\nquarter-final tie with neighbours Holbein and Willis Jackson, which turned\nout to be more than eventful. Southwell were only able to convert one of\nthe many chances they created in the\nfirst half. However, the real drama was\nto follow in the second half. The action\nimmediately recommenced as Southwell stormed to a 4-1 lead with goals\nfrom Alex Smith and Myles Jarvis.\nThe Holbein team eventually realised\nthat Alex \u2018Sandy\u2019 Riley was making\nhis debut in goal (in place of an absent Rob Hollinshead) and managed to\nexploit this fact by scoring two quick\ngoals. All that remained on Southwell\u2019s mind was to maintain the one\ngoal lead until the final whistle. Everything was going according to plan\nuntil the last action of the game, when\nhuman wrecking-ball Johan Rekers\n(again, unnecessarily) steamrolled his\nway through one of the Willy J players\nin the box. This sparked a 20-minute\ndebate on the severity and malicious-ness of the challenge, to which the two\ncaptains settled on an unorthodox indirect free-kick in the penalty area to\nHolbein and Willis Jackson FC. With\nevery single Southwell player lined up\non their own goal line, Holbein captain\nSean Jordan miraculously managed to\nfind the net, taking it into extra time.\nWith both teams clearly exhausted,\nSouthwell went behind after a spill\nfrom Jono Palmer, who had relieved\nSandy Riley from his nightmare in\ngoal. In the second half of extra time,\nSouthwell showed true character and\nfought back with a goal from Jarvis to\ntake the match into penalties.\nThe first four penalties taken by Butt,\nPalmer, Jarvis and last-minute call up\nJoe Kempton were dispatched with\nno issue only to be matched by their\nHolbein and Willis Jackson counter-parts. The fifth penalty taker for Willis Jackson stepped up only to have\nhis attempt saved by another substitute\nkeeper: Matthew Taylor. The pressure\nwas now solely on the shoulders of\nAlex Smith to carry Southwell through\nto the next round. In an atmosphere\none can only describe as tantamount\nto a World Cup Final, Smith failed to\nseal the deal. Sudden death. One more\npenalty rattled the back of the net for\nWillis Jackson and so the burden shifts\nto pasta-loving Italian Andrea Greco.\nThe keeper stands tall in his goal as\nGreco strikes the ball. The next few\nseconds seemed like a lifetime, as the\nball somehow ricocheted off one post\nand on to the other before crossing the\nline, leaving the Southwell team both\nconfused and overjoyed as they were\nnot out of it yet. The seventh penalty\nfor Willis Jackson resulted in another\nbrilliant save by Taylor which meant\nthat captain Zarucki, who had been\nneglecting responsibility, or as he put\nit, \u201cregaining energy\u201d, called his own\nnumber and stepped up. Under the\npressure formed by a crowd or random\nbypassers, Zarucki delivered one final\nswing of his boot which secured the\nHornets passage into the semi-finals.\nSemi-final\nAfter such a close shave in the quar-ters, Southwell were hoping to dispatch\nEastside FC in the semi-finals without\nhaving to undergo the same drama.\nAgain, Southwell started strong, utilising the long throw of Taha Butt to\npenetrate Eastside\u2019s box on numerous\noccasions resulting in goals from Jono\nPalmer and Mateusz Zarucki in the\nfirst half. It was also apparent during\nthis game that the back four of Southwell had finally found some cohesion.\nMan-mountain Alex Coney, along with\nthe slick-skilled Martin Kouame, who\nhad anchored the back four throughout\nmost of the season, teamed up with\nJames Johnston and an out-of-position\nJono Palmer, to provide Southwell\nwith a solid defence and only their\nsecond clean sheet of the season. With\nanother goal by Jono Palmer bagged in\nthe closing stages of the second half,\nSouthwell wrapped up the semi-final\nwith a convincing 3-0 win just as news\nfiltered through from the opposite\npitch that Beit FC too had won, setting\nup a mouth-watering final.\nFinal\nSouthwell, dressed in their infamous\nblack and neon-yellow kits, came\ninto the final as underdogs against\nlast year\u2019s winners, Beit Hall, kitted\nout in a more subtle and professional\n(and boring) navy blue. The biggest\ngame of the season was done justice\nby a record-breaking crowd of three\ndie-hard supporters who had made the\nlong journey to Harlington to cheer on\ntheir team. As he had all season long,\ncaptain Zarucki gave a motivational\nand very emotional team talk before\nthe match. At 2pm, with the scorching\nsun high in the sky, the match kicked\noff. In the early stages both teams\nstarted slowly in an attempt to not\nwaste too much energy. A few probing\nballs and decent runs down the wing\nby Moe \u2018MoeMoe\u2019 Fekry was all that\ncould be mustered by both sides. The\nbest chance of the first half fell for\nBeit when a corner headed back across\nthe six yard boxed was poked towards\ngoal only to be saved by Hollinshead.\nCaptain Zarucki kept his team inspired\nas chances during the first half seemed\nfairly few and far between for Southwell who couldn\u2019t quite find the final\nball, despite the relentless effort by the\nmidfield in the blistering heat. Matthew Taylor returned to the side, after\nmissing the semi-final, to play centre back allowing Martin Kouame to\nmove to left back. Both players put in\nexcellent performances hassling some\nof Beit\u2019s key personnel. With a free-kick taken by Beit\u2019s Bilal Abou El Ela\nflying over the bar, the first half action\nwrapped up and both sides retired to\nthe shade with a goalless draw.\nWith oranges at the ready, Zarucki\ndelivered his halftime team talk and\nthe mood was pretty good in the Southwell camp. Out of the sun and finally\nable to gather themselves together, the\nSouthwell team then went about plotting how to improve upon their performance before heading back out into\nthe heat.\nThe second half began a lot more\nspritely for Southwell. Taha Butt and\nTito Bastianello combined well in\nmidfield distributing the ball a lot better and picking out players\u2019 runs. As\nalways, Andrea Greco provided much\nneeded width down the left flank as\nSouthwell managed to get some decent\ncrosses into the box and put pressure\non the Beit back four. The first clear-cut chance for the boys in black and\nyellow came via Jarvis\u2019 failed attempt\nto convert Butt\u2019s goal-bound corner\nby clearing it off the Beit goal line in-stead. Beit however weren\u2019t going to\ngive in that easily and an onslaught of\nlong balls and darting sprints rained\ndown on the Hornets\u2019 defence. Fortunately, Alex Coney and Matthew\nTaylor were once again up to the task\nof putting their boot through anything\nthat came within scoring distance of\nthe Southwell goal. After strikes by\nTaha Butt and Nicusor Popescu (which\nwere closer to the corner flag than the\ngoal) combined with the relentless sun\ncaused tempers to fray as both sides\nbecame impatient. With challenges\nflying in all over the shop, some more\ndangerous than others, heated arguments between the teams sprouted and\nthen the match got a lot more personal.\nThe game continued to ebb and flow\nwith both sides getting close to their\nopponents\u2019 goal yet still not breaking\nthe deadlock.\nAt around the 75 minute mark, Beit\nwere awarded a free kick in dangerous\n\u201cThe two captains\nsettled on an unorthodox indirect freekick\u201d\n\u201cThe second half began a lot more sprite-ly for Southwell\u201d\nSouthwell seize the glory at Harlington\n...Continued from Back Page\nTensions ran high during the Southwell vs. Beit final at Harlington\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nFELIX Friday 08 JUNE 2012 31\nterritory. A four man wall was constructed and Bilal once again stepped\nup to take it. This time his free-kick\nwas on target and required a reaction\nsave from goalkeeper Hollinshead to\nhis left. The danger was not over. A\npoorly cleared corner ball found of one\nof the Beit team members, Oli Klottka,\nwho struck the ball goal-bound, but\nwas cleared off the line by the ever-re-liable face of centre back Alex Coney.\nSouthwell replied with a dangerous\nheader from captain Zarucki, which\nwas followed by a decent save from\nBeit captain Chris Aspinall. Finally the\ngame\u2019s excitement seemed to be living\nup to its billing.\nSouthwell began to counter by finding space down the wings. With five\nminutes to go, Greco linked up well\nwith Kouame (who finally had enough\nenergy to take part in an offensive\nplay) and managed to cross the ball\nthrough one of Beit\u2019s player\u2019s legs to\nthe Southwell captain on the edge of\nthe box. Without hesitation, Mateusz\ntook the shot with his left foot and\nslotted the ball past the keeper into the\nbottom left corner. Goalscorer Zarucki\nimmediately headed to the corner flag\nwhere he began to engage in some\nrisqu\u00e9 activities with the flag before\nbeing joined by the rest of the team,\nbench and all, in a euphoric celebra-tion. Needless to say Beit were not\npleased and were keen to get play back\nunderway.\nContent with a one goal lead with\nonly minutes remaining, shouts of\n\u201cnil-nil\u201d and \u201cplay it safe\u201d reverberated around the Southwell team. Yet\nonly minutes after the restart, Jarvis\u2019\n100th attempt to get past all of the Beit\nteam finally succeeded as he broke\nfree of the defence down the left hand\nside, where he managed to fire home\na second goal from a narrow angle. A\ntwo goal lead for Southwell in the last\nminutes was everything the Hornets\ncould have asked for, and they knew\nthat they couldn\u2019t have let that chance\nslip by.\nWith only injury time to go, a rather audacious effort on goal from the\nhalfway line by Beit\u2019s Bilal was dealt\nwith comfortably, as the pressure on\nBeit started to mount faster and faster.\nMore taunts going back and forth between players really brought to light\nhow much this game meant to both\nsides. In a desperate attempt from\nBeit FC, Bilal\u2019s header managed to hit\nthe crossbar. The Southwell defences\nstood strong against the multiple balls\nplayed into the box from either wing,\nwith Martin Kouame cementing his\nMan of the Match award.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity to\nthe Hornets, the referee blew the final\nwhistle and Southwell & Bernard Sunley Hornets FC were thereby crowned\nthe 2012 Champions of the Interhall\nEvelyn Gardens Cup! The celebrations began almost immediately with\n\u2018MoeMoe\u2019 leading the spraying of\nwater, mimicking champagne, and the\ndrenching of the captain in an American sport style \u2018Gatorade bath\u2019. At the\nprize giving ceremony, Beit were very\ngracious in defeat and all in-match\nhostility dissipated. As the trophy was\nhoisted high into the air in front of\nthe three fans to rapturous applause,\nthere was a moment to reflect on the\nwhole season and just how much we\nchanged as a team since the shoddy\nperformances just months ago, to the\nchampions we were now.\n\u201cMore taunts [...]\nbrought to light how\nmuch this game\nmeant to both sides\u201d\nCaptain\u2019s Post Match Statement\n\u201cOur strength was not that we had individualities in the squad, but\nthat we formed a team that really understood each other on and\noff the pitch. I would like to thank you all for coming Sunday after\nSunday and giving your best, as well as having to read my useless\nFacebook posts and listen to my very emotional speeches \u2013 I\nhope that you all had just as much fun as I did! I would also like\nto thank Anthony Hennelly and Sport Imperial for organizing this\nevent and giving us a way of taking a break from all the work!\u201d\n\u2013 Southwell and Bernard Sunley FC Captain Mateusz Zarucki\nNot champagne, but close enough\nVictory is sweet for Southwell.

Those who\ndon\u2019t may want to put their thinking caps on for a\nmoment (and maybe lay off the bath salts for few\nface-chewing minutes). 2009 was the earth-shat-tering year in which the painfully mediocre band\nAsh decided the album was dead. They went on\nto prove that the album had kicked the bass and\ngone to the holy record player in the sky by recording a series of singles that, wait for it, they ended\nup releasing as a compilation that looked, to the\nuntrained eye, suspiciously like an album. I recount\nto you this tale of hubris and face-plantingly abject\nfailure because I want to provide a good contrast\nbetween the dumbest mutha-whats in modern mu-sic, and Adam Bainbridge (Kindness), who feels like\nthe smartest mutha-fo in modern music.\nThis album, with touches of Arthur Russell and\nPrince, has for the first time in my life helped me\nunderstand pop music. I keep trying to think of\nsmart, esoteric genres that will describe Kindness\nbut I keep coming back to the same thought: \u201cIt\u2019s\npop throwback, it\u2019s nostalgic, it\u2019s disco, it\u2019s awe-some; to hell with you all!\u201d I spent my childhood\nscratching my head in utter confusion while watching Top of the Pops 2, but now I\u2019m considering making \u201cMusic Was Better During The Cold War\u201d my\nofficial slogan...\nThe album has its weaknesses, the most obvious is that at times it doesn\u2019t feel entirely cohesive\nand as one, but its high points are dizzyingly high.\n\u2018Cyan\u2019, a song that\u2019s been around on the interwebz\nfor some time, is as close to achieving pop tran-scendance as my limited pop knowledge will allow\nme to claim. It\u2019s got an irresistible beat, an impeccable intro, and little drops of, I\u2019m guessing, xylophone which make it instantly addictive. House is\nanother treat which sounds a bit like what James\nBlake would if he stopped wingeing for second.\nMy favourite though is \u2018Gee Up\u2019, which is 1:52 of\nunadulterated funky bass. (It also has the wittiest\nmusic video I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time).\nKindness has spoken wistfully of the effort that\nused to go into buying and listening to albums. Once\nyou\u2019d made your purchase you wouldn\u2019t just casually\nclick shuffle and listen to something else. You\u2019d invested in the album and \u201cthe money that you spent\nand the scarcity of music prior to the internet and\nstreaming meant that you would make the effort to\nlisten and listen and listen\u201d, he told the Telegraph.\nIt\u2019s 2012, and I made next to no investment in listening to World, You Need A Change Of Mind, but boy\nhave I listened, and listened, and listened.\nIf you thought you\u2019d seen the end of this column, and\nare peeved that it\u2019s back, tweet @kadhimshubber\nand tell me to \u201cGo the hell back where you came\nfrom!\u201d Alternatively, tweet @feliximperial threatening\nto call The Daily Telegraph...\nWhat\u2019s been the high point so far?\nSeeing the reactions to the first release really;\nthere were so many positive comments and\nsupport coming from everywhere. It was really great to see a lot of artists that I look up to\nshowing us love. I even enjoyed the negative\nones, just great to see what people thought of\nour first offering.\nYeah, as long as it\u2019s thoughtful criticism,\npositive or negative is always good.\nDefinitely, my favourite was \u201cdid they use any\nother instruments other than a bag of rusty\nforks being thrown down a flight of stairs?\u201d\nOuch! To be fair, you\u2019ve got to love a creative insult...\nBeats \u201cyour mum\u201d jokes anytime\u2026\nSo, just a few questions left. Who would you\nlove to work with, who you\u2019re not working\nwith already?\nWe\u2019ve got some fantastic new artists that we\u2019re\nworking with at the moment, they\u2019re featuring\non the next release, really happy with the work\nthey\u2019ve come up with. In the future I\u2019d just like\nto keep working with new talent until finally\ngaining enough notoriety to record a Christmas\nsingle with Gucci Mane and Morrissey.\nGood call. When can we expect the next re-lease?\nWe\u2019re just putting the finishing touches on it at\nthe moment, so hopefully as some point over\nthe summer.\nLook forward to it. Just before you go, obviously have to ask you the most important\nquestion... What\u2019s your favourite dinosaur?\nThe little ratty one with the weird neck skin\nthat spat in the fat bloke\u2019s eyes on Jurassic\nPark, I liked his style\u2026\nBest answer to that question ever... Cheers\nJosh, catch you next week at Diggidy Dawg.\nCheers mate, looking forward to it!\nable music has become, people just fire out\nthrowaway music with no thought or meaning behind it. We\u2019re looking to just put out\n(what we deem to be) quality records which\nexplore some new territories and bring back a\nbit of feeling to music, regardless of whether\nit\u2019s on trend or not. Artist wise, there\u2019s a lot\nof absolutely brilliant musicians and producers\nout there that share our idea and those people\nshould be aware that we\u2019re coming for them.\nAre you just talking about the flood of music you find on the Internet, or do you also\nmean the music you hear in clubs (or reputable establishments, in 1950s speak...)?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the internet has produced\na channel where there are endless opportunities to help promote new talent and it\u2019s a brilliant thing. But I think that overall it\u2019s led to\nthe traditional task of developing an act becoming less of a priority.\nSame with club nights, a lot of club promoters\ndon\u2019t understand the work that has to go into\nevents and that there has to be a sense of identity that goes with it.\nAh I get you, there\u2019s less longevity, or patience you mean?\nExactly.\nGive us a brief idea of what starting your\nown label is like. In terms of finding the\nartists, then putting your name out there; I\nimagine it\u2019s pretty hard graft.\nI was quite lucky in the aspect that I had a\ngroup of artists that I\u2019d been working with\non various projects for a number of years. So\nafter getting them on board, we started going\nthrough possible tracks for the first release,\nwhich took a really long time, working together and making alterations to tracks and\ndiscussing the best way for them to go out. A\ncouple of the artists I met along the way, at this\npoint. In terms of coming up with the branding\nand visuals for the label, again I\u2019m very lucky\nto have a lot of very gifted friends who helped\nme out to no end with that. I see it as a bit of\na community project really, there\u2019s so many\npeople involved!\nH\ney Josh, how are you doing?\nVery well thanks mate, how\nabout you?\nNot bad, just listening to some Patchwork\nPirates so things could be worse.\nNice, I\u2019m Fleetwood Mac\u2019ing it.\nHaha. Let\u2019s start with the easy stuff, what\ndoes XVI stand for? I keep saying X-V-I in\nmy head.\nIt is indeed XVI, it stands for Ten Against One.\nRoman numerals\u2026\nI clearly should have taken more Latin\nclasses... How would you describe XVI to\nsomeone who\u2019d never heard of it before?\nThe sound that we are pushing is a deep,\nspaced out, soulful one... Ranging from more\navant garde downtempo beats, right up to more\nupbeat house and garage crossovers.\nYou\u2019ve got a night up in Chester, called Lion\nRoar, and you\u2019ve got your own label. You\u2019re\npretty busy for a 22-year-old...\nHaha\u2026 Well idle time is the devil\u2019s plaything\nafter all. I think that in the music industry as\nit stands today, you really have to roll up your\nsleeves and get your hands dirty with all aspects of music: promoting parties, releasing\nmusic, managing artists... It\u2019s one of the only\nways to put across the true meaning of the music ideals you\u2019re pushing\u2026\nWas there a point at which you realised,\n\u201cHey I need to be the person who\u2019s finding\nthe music and putting it out to people?\u201d Or\nhave you always kind of had that approach\nto music?\nHmm I think I\u2019ve always been pretty selective about the music I listened to, when I first\nstarted out I was promoting punk shows up\nNorth, so I suppose when you\u2019re in the position of picking music for people to come and\ndance to, you put yourself in that position to\na certain extent. After a while I found that so\nmany people I knew were making great music\nwhich just wasn\u2019t getting the exposure it de-served, so I suppose making the leap to starting\na record label isn\u2019t such a far cry from being a\npromoter in some ways. It\u2019s a nice feeling to\nbe able to show people new music that they\nweren\u2019t aware of before, but obviously vice\nversa, I love having someone play me some\nmusic from an artist I\u2019ve never heard of and be\nblown away by it.\nTell us more about the \u201cmusic ideals you\u2019re\npushing\u201d. Is there something specific you\u2019re\nlooking for in the artists you work with? Either musically, or personally?\nBasically, a lot of the electronic and \u201cdance\u201d\nmusic industry is pretty horrific. Because of\nthe internet and how available and dispos-XVI rolling deep\nXVI Records take over Metric\nKadhim Shubber chats with Josh Byrne, head of XVI Records\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 08 JUNE 2012 23\nMacLaine\u2019s AFI glory\nThe Turning Point (1977)\nMacLaine started off her\nshowbiz career as a dancer\nbefore turning to acting, and\nso the cut-throat, ruthless ballet world would not have been\na strange world to dive into. In\nthis story of love, jealousy, ambition and unfulfilled dreams,\na mixture which can lead to\ndisastrous, explosive conse-quences, MacLaine plays the\ntalented dancer who gave it\nall up for having a family. It so\nhappens her daughter is now\nbeing trained by one of her ex-rivals, Anne Bancroft. A bitter\nfeud ensues, in which bottled\nup feelings and resentment\nfrom the past resurface, leading to intense confrontations,\nand at one point, a physical\nfist-fight. MacLaine is heart-breakingly effective as someone who could have had it all.\nPostcards from the Edge\n(1990)\nHere we get the chance to\nsee the lighter, more musical,\nfunnier side of MacLaine: an\nactress so wonderfully gifted that she can pull off just\nabout anything. She sings,\nshe dances, she screams,\nshe gets drunk, she crashes\nher daughter\u2019s (Meryl Streep)\ncar, but ultimately, she makes\nus laugh. As a has-been,\nwashed-up star of the 50s\nand 60s, MacLaine is given\nthe role of taking care of her\nrecovering addict actress\ndaughter. Never quite knowing\nhow to adjust to a less glamorous and glitzy life of a faded\nHollywood star, she spends\nher days criticising her daugh-ter, drinking, hosting shambol-ic parties, and oh yes, even\nmore drinking.\nThe Children\u2019s Hour\n(1961)\nMartha (Shirley MacLaine)\nlikes Karen (Audrey Hepburn).\nThey are teachers in a school,\nand they\u2019re the best of friends.\nBut are they too close for the\n60s? After a bitter, resentful\nstudent starts an unfounded\nyet highly damaging rumour\nabout the relationship the two\nof them share, their worlds\ncome crashing down, more so\nfor Karen who has a fianc\u00e9.\nIt\u2019s a heartbreaking tale of\nforbidden love and conservative ideas, played with warm\nsincerity and heart by the two\ncharming leads. It\u2019s MacLaine\nwho has the more challenging role given her character\u2019s\nmore ambiguous emotions,\nand her carefully restrained\nperformance makes the bold\nending all the more tragic.\nTerms of Endearment\n(1983)\nThis film itself is an overlong\nsoap opera full of forced\ntears and heavily nostalgic\nmoments, and it\u2019s true it\nshould not have won the Best\nPicture Oscar in 1984. But\nMacLaine herself gives the\nperformance of her career, as\nan over-bearing, protective, often suffocating mother whose\nonly real crime is looking out\nfor her daughter. They argue,\nthey fight, she doesn\u2019t like her\nson-in-law, she\u2019s judgemental,\npassive-aggressive, all in the\nname of wanting what is best\nfor her daughter. Then cancer enters the picture for the\ndaughter, and the weepy fest\ngoes even crazier with clich\u00e9s\nand long, sad speeches. It\u2019s\na real downer this one, saved\nonly by MacLaine\u2019s presence.\nBernie (2011)\nThis excellent dark comedy\ndebuted at the BFI London\nFilm Festival but is yet to be\ngiven a proper, full release.\nThe format of the film, a semi-documentary dramedy set in\nthe southern parts of America,\nmust make this a tough sell,\nbut with Jack Black\u2019s faultless,\nhighly enjoyable performance,\nMatthew McConaughey\u2019s laid-back, sleazy legal prosecutor,\nand a frighteningly convincing\nperformance as a lonely, possessive old lady who no-one\nlikes by MacLaine, Bernie is\nan unexpectedly hysterical\nand touching dramedy about a\nfuneral director with a heart of\ngold, with a murder thrown in\nfor excitement. Curious? You\nshould be, and if/when this\nfilm is released, be amazed by\nBlack on career-best form.\nBest MacLaine Performances\n\n"

Being underground,\nthis year\u2019s Pavilion is more discrete than previous years, though this does not make it any\nless impressive.

For all you festival fanatics\nout there, this is the perfect chance to spend four\ndrunken days swimming in love, happiness and\njust a little mud. Even if festivals aren\u2019t exactly\nyour thing, it will give you something to do in the\nlong, hot summer (5 \u2013 8 of July to be precise) if\nyou were planning to spend it doing not much of\nanything...\nEmail us your BEST FESTIVAL STORY \u2013 in 20\nwords max. \u2013 to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk to be\nin with a chance of winning a PAIR OF TICKETS!\nSleep is supposed to be\nBy souls of sanity\nThe shutting of the eye.\nSleep is the station grand\nDown which, on either hand\nThe hosts of witness stand!\nMorn is supposed to be\nBy people of degree\nThe breaking of the Day.\nMorning has not occurred!\nThat shall Aurora be --East of Eternity --One with the banner gay --One in the red array --That is the break of Day!\nOur Felix poets are on holiday this week (or possibly on exam time) so instead we bring you some\nEmily Dickinson on the wonder of sleep... for all-nighters!\nSleep is supposed to be\nby Emily Dickinson\nWeiwei to the Serpentine\nThe perfect summer hangout spot is ten minutes from Imperial\nskies above \u2013 a parallel to (or blatant copy of\n\u2013 you can be the judge) Anish Kapoor\u2019s mirror\nsculptures that featured through Kensington\nGardens only two years ago. This platform,\nhowever, has one up on Kapoor\u2019s mirrors as\nthe water can be drained and the area can be\ntransformed into a dance floor for the Serpentine Gallery\u2019s Park Nights events. Against the\nbackdrop of the traditional Serpentine Gallery building, it really is striking.\nYou can then explore underneath this sur-face, where you enter into an underground den,\ncladded with cork. Weiwei and the architects\ndesigned the pavilion from an archaeological\napproach, digging into the ground and finding the remnants of pavilions from the past 12\nyears. Using these previous foundations and\nfloor plans as their inspiration for the layout,\nthe area is formed by an abstract layering of\nshapes and levels. Like any good piece of art,\nit stands alone as an beautiful piece; made only\nmore interesting when you realise the story and\njourney behind it; and with the wettest April in\n100 years, it\u2019s nothing short of a miracle that\nthis structure was finished in time.\nThe pavilion is the creative vision of Ai\nWeiwei, a Chinese political activist artist who\nspecialises in sculpture and installations, using\nmass production as his inspiration for his lat-Laura Johnston\n\u201cThe pavilion is the creative vision of Ai Weiwei...\nChinese activist artist\u201d\nest pieces. His most significant recent work\nwas Sunflower Seeds: set in the Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Room, the 100 million porcelain\npieces were each painstakingly hand painted.\nWorking alongside Weiwei is the award winning Swiss architecture company Herzog & de\nMeuron. Founded by two classmates they are\nmost famously known in Britain for their conversion of the Bankside Power Station in to the\nTate Modern in 2000, and are now working\non the extension, \u2018Tate 2\u2019. Though this is their\nfirst collaboration in the UK, Weiwei and the\narchitects are not strangers, having worked together on several projects, including the iconic\n\u2018Bird\u2019s Nest\u2019 stadium of the Beijing Olympics\n\u2013 making this installation a nice link from the\n2008 Olympics to this summer\u2019s event in London.\nRegardless of the artistic journey behind the\npavilion, the underground den can be appreciated by everyone at face value as an area to\nhang out in, meet friends and enjoy Hyde Park\nduring the soggy British summer. And while\nthe rest of London will be painfully busy, let\u2019s\nkeep this as our little secret: a cultural hide out\nin the heart of our city.\nThe Serpentine Summer Pavillion is open\nuntil the 14 October 2012.\nI\u2019m like Jamiroquai, going deeper underground Escape the rain.

    "content": "A\nt first they thought that the\nexperiment had gone awry.\nThey\u2019d spent years studying\nsilicon compounds and thought\nthey knew what to expect. But\nthis compound was different. It was unstable,\nseemingly unpredictable \u2013 constantly shifting\nbetween electronic states. This compound was\nmisbehaving.\n\u201cWe were puzzled,\u201d remembers Professor\nTony Kenyon, head of the Photonic Materials Laboratory at University College London.\n\u201cThe immediate thought was that there was\nsomething wrong. I had a new PhD student, so\nI gave him some samples and said: \u2018go and find\nout what the problem is\u2019.\u201d\nThat student was Adnan Mehonic, and he\nwas about to tell his supervisor something\nvery surprising. \u201cHe came back to me and said,\nthey\u2019re not unstable, they\u2019re programmable.\u201d\nAnd did the professor believe him? \u201cI looked\nat Adnan\u2019s evidence and thought: that\u2019s real.\nThis is a really exciting prospect.\u201d\nWhat Professor Kenyon\u2019s team had inadvertently created was an electronic component\nthat could not only vary its resistance, but also\n\u201cremember\u201d its last resistive state. Silicon oxide is usually an electronic insulator, but the\nteam believe that the \u201cextra\u201d atoms within\ntheir compound move around when exposed to\nan electric field, forming conductive filaments.\nBy altering the voltage, resistance can be continuously varied, creating a special type of\nelectronic switch. Their compound, it seemed,\nwas a memory-resistor \u2013 a memristor.\nThe memristor\u2019s existence was first postulated in 1971, but scientists long struggled to turn\nSweet, sweet serendipity\nFELIX\nFriday 08 june 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\n\u201c\u201d\nIf you find yourself\ncompeting against\nsilicon, don\u2019t.\nThese days we are overwhelmed with clever tech-nology. From the wonders of the iPad to the practicality of satellite navigation. There are few areas of\nour lives that are not enhanced by technology, so\nit is hard to imagine how it could develop further.\nBut, surprisingly, the answer may be in nature \u2013 in\nbacteria, to be precise.\nA research group at Leeds University have been\nworking with magnet-making bacteria and their findings may provide a step towards producing more\ncost-effective and environmentally-friendly electronics in the future.\nIn nature, these bacteria have been observed to\n\u2018eat\u2019 iron to create a surface of magnets, similar to\nthose found in computer hard drives. \u201cNo one really\nknows why they make them, but it seems to help\nthem line up along the magnetic field allowing them\nto find their \u2018happy place\u2019, where they can can access food and oxygen,\u201d explains doctoral student,\nJoanna Galloway, lead author of the study.\nThe bacteria used in this research were identified originally in 1975, however this is the first time\nthey\u2019ve been successfully grown in the lab. \u201cThey\nlive in really niche, narrow environments so they\u2019re\nquite difficult to actually grow in a lab and study\nproperly,\u201d says Galloway.\nThe team have been working on a \u2018bottom-up\u2019\napproach to create these environmentally-friendly\ncomputers. This is where components are left to\nassemble themselves into a pattern, compared\nto the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach of technology production where desired patterns are etched out from a\nsurface. The benefits are cost friendly too. \u201cRather\nthan having to use expensive equipment each time,\nif you maintain the right conditions you can get the\nmaterials to assemble themselves. Also, the technique doesn\u2019t require horrible chemicals or high\ntemperatures so its very cost effective,\u201d explains\nGalloway.\nCurrently the researchers are working with temperatures of 80\u00baC to develop these magnetic particles but now they are working on testing their\neffectiveness at room temperature. They will also\nbe trying out different magnetic proteins to assess\ntheir ability to store and retain information like a\ncomputer.\nDespite this research being in its early stages, it\nis possible that we could witness the beginnings of\na biological computer in most of our lifetimes, \u201cin\n15 years time, you wouldn\u2019t have a whole bacterial computer but prototype components for it could\npossibly be templated using this process.\u201d\nI wonder if Apple will catch on to this...ePad any-one?!\nJulia Robinson\nMagnet-making bacteria,\nassemble!\ntheory into practice. Then, in 2008, IT-giant\nHewlett-Packard announced the creation of the\nworld\u2019s first memristor \u2013 and with it, a type of\nelectronic memory a hundred-times faster and\na thousand-times more efficient than its com-petitors. Unfortunately for HP, this titanium-based compound, like the variations that have\nfollowed, was both expensive to produce and\nunviable in ambient conditions.\nThe UCL device is neither of these things. It\nis also made of silicon, the element quite literally at the core of global electronics. There\u2019s a\nsaying in the industry, says Professor Kenyon:\n\u201cIf you find yourself competing against sili-con, don\u2019t.\u201d His team have stuck to this max-im, making it relatively easy to assimilate their\ncomponent into existing silicon technology, be\nit microchips, processors, or even satellites.\nWhich explains why industry has taken such\nan interest. According to Professor Kenyon,\ndiscussions are underway with several leading\ncompanies and the new technology could hit\nthe market in as little as three years, \u201cif we\u2019re\nlucky.\u201d An apt disclaimer from a scientist who\nknows the value of a little bit of good luck.\nVictoria Charlton on a surprising discovery and a resisitor that remembers\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that global warming is a bad thing. Icebergs are melting,\nseas are rising and holidays to the Maldives\nmay become relegated to wistful anecdotes of\nthe iPod generation. However for species such\nas the Aricia agestis or Brown Argus butterfly,\nwarmer autumns such as the one the UK experienced in 2011 are providing an opportunity for\nthem to spread their wings and multiply.\nResearch at the University of York showed\nthat rather than constraining the habitat of the\nbutterfly, the warmer climate in recent years has\nchanged the diet of the Brown Argus, allowing\ncaterpillar development to take place in much\nmore northerly locations than ever before.\n\u201cWhile it [the Brown Argus] was previously\nrestricted to using Rockrose, it\u2019s now been\nable to incorporate Geranium species into its\ndiet \u2013 and we don\u2019t think its been an evolutionary switch,\u201d says Rachel Pateman, lead author\nof the study. Rachel and her team believe that\nthe butterflies have always had the capacity to\ncomplete their life cycle using the widespread\nGeranium species, but only when the weather\nis warmer. Now that climate change has increased summer temperatures, the Brown Argus can use this common species to lay their\neggs in more geographically distinct areas.\nThe data, collected by volunteers from the\nUK charity Butterfly Conservation and published in the journal Science, highlights the\ndisparity between the traditional view of climate change as a catastrophic problem and\nthe finer details of its effects. However the authors of the study are careful to highlight that\nthe Brown Argus is just one positive result in\na plethora of data. \u201cThere\u2019ll be winners and\nlosers from climate change,\u201d says Rachel Pateman. And it isn\u2019t just other species that may\nbe threatened from the effects of a warmer cli-mate. The Brown Argus has only been studied\nin the UK so far. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in other parts of its range, because its\ndistributed throughout Europe and through to\nButterflies get boost from climate\nNorthAfrica, so it might be that in those places\nits getting too warm for it and its doing badly\nthere,\u201d Rachel cautions.\nThe issue of global warming is set to stir up\ninteresting findings and debate in the future.\nWhile rising temperatures are good news for\nthe Brown Argus butterfly, it is important to\nremember those species that may not get their\nday in the sun.\nHelen Wilkes\nBrown Argus butterfly is one species that has benefited from climate change\nJim Asher\n\n"

    "content": "ceive so many emails from Ernst and\nYoung not because they are excellent,\nbut because they are rich.\nIt\u2019s important to know that a lot of\nthe information we receive is driven by\nwealth rather than quality.\nFor those of us interested in, for ex-ample, journalism (and there are a lot\nof us, just look at the award-winning\nFelix) the system can be quite unhelp-ful. I very nearly convinced myself to\nwork for a bank (something I certainly\nwould have hated) because it seemed to\nbe the only job. My acquaintance, with\nwhom I visited the careers fair, was exactly the same.\nAs another student said, \u201cUnless\nyou\u2019re already clued up about what you\nwant to do, it can seem like banking (or\na PhD I guess) is the only option.\u201d\nLast term, I complained about the\nlack of information for people who\nwant to work for a charity. The director of the Careers Service informed me\nthat, in May, the Internships Careers\nof representatives of Banking, Finance,\nTechnology, Law and Consulting, as\nwell as slightly larger variety of career\nevents, including Journalism and Charity fairs.\nInstead of Targeted Emailing, though,\nCambridge has an opt-in system called\nCLICK. Students can select which careers they are interested in, and they\u2019ll\nreceive emails only about these.\nUCL Careers is quite open about its\nfunding. Its \u201c[self-generated] income\ncurrently supports staff salaries, student IT facilities, careers publications\nand the development of services and\nevents.\u201d One wonders whether the service is funded by the University at all.\nUCL has no sponsorship club of any\nkind, though it does have individual\nsponsors with even less variety than\nImperial\u2019s: Citi, Deloitte, Ernst &\nYoung, KPMG, the usual culprits.\nBut none of these Universities can\nget anywhere near Oxford in terms of\nover-sponsorship. For a mere \u00a33,500\nper year, you could be a Recruiters\u2019\nGroup Partner, giving you access to a\ndatabase of Oxford students. The database contains personal information,\nincluding contact details, languages\nspoken and academic ability. Members\nof this group are permitted to contact\nthe students using the details provided.\nOn the upside, membership of this\nRecruiters\u2019 Group is free to all chari-ties, and heavily discounted to small\nbusinesses; but whether this mitigates\nthe creepiness of the student database\nis hard to say.\nIt seems, then, that Imperial\u2019s Careers Service is fairly typical of the\nservices at similar universities, though\n(thankfully) not quite like Oxford\u2019s.\nHow to fix it\nBack at Imperial: the Careers Service,\nof course, is not to blame for this situ-ation: they genuinely do the best they\ncan for students with what they are\ngiven. The problem is, I think, a lack\nof funding from the University.\n\u201cWe have organised public sector\ncareer forums in the past,\u201d Farrar told\nme, \u201chowever low student attendance\nrates have meant we have had to pri-FEATURE\nFELIX Friday 08 JUNE 2012 7\nf too much sponsorship\ns why many students seem disappointed with heavily sponsored Careers Services\nWhat the students say*:\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re already clued up about what you want to do,\nit can seem like banking (or a PhD I guess) is the only option\nout there.Would be nice if other kinds of careers got a look\nin.\u201d\n\u201cMy view on the problem with the Careers Service is that\nwhen you measure the success of an organisation primarily\nby how many people get jobs and how much they get paid,\nit\u2019s not surprising that they push the latter.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to work for a bank or a massive corporation so\nit\u2019s pretty much useless to me.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the case that the big banks, accountancy firms etc are\nparticularly interested in Imperial students and are offering\nup plenty of places, why wouldn\u2019t the Careers Service help\nadvertise the clear demand for Imperial students?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re very good, if you go in with the right mentality.\u201d\n\u201cThe life that is most pushed down Imperial students\u2019 throats\nis banking and banking-related jobs; the reason why is our\nCareers Service receives almost no funding from College and\nis therefore forced to sell us to those most able to pay.\u201d\n\u201cThere is definitely not enough variety in the career options\npresented to us.\u201d\n*Despite what you may think, this actually is a representative sample.\n\u201cA lot of the information we receive\nis driven by wealth\nrather than quality.\u201d\n\u201cReleasing the Careers budget would\nprejudice Imperial\u2019s\ncommerical interests.\u201d\nFair would be \u201cspecifically targeting\nthe charity sector.\u201d\nWhen I went to the fair, I found that\nonly six of the 44 stalls were held by\ncharities, compared with 8 consulting\nfirms and 15 technology companies.\nOne of the charities, in fact, isn\u2019t actually a registered charity in the UK.\nAlthough it is not the case, it looks\nas though non-corporate job opportunities are marginalised (to the nervous\nnewcomer, it looks as though these job\nopportunities don\u2019t exist at all). Which,\nwhen you consider the wealth disparity\nbetween Oxfam and Goldman Sachs, is\nnot surprising.\nAn inevitable consequence, perhaps,\nof the fact that the amount of disposable income a company has determines\nhow much we hear about them.\nWhat it\u2019s like elsewhere\nCambridge is much the same as Imperial, with a \u201cSupporters Club\u201d consisting\noritise other types of fair.\u201d That this\nshould be a problem says a lot about\nthe Careers Service\u2019s funding.\nI have attempted several times to find\ndetails of the Careers Service\u2019s budget,\nto no avail. In response to a Freedom\nof Information request earlier this year,\nthe College claimed that releasing the\ninformation would \u201cprejudice the commercial interests\u201d of the University.\nBut given that the Careers Service\ncharges money for attending careers\nfairs, sponsoring careers fairs, advertising in Careers magazines, sending emails, and joining the Patron\u2019s\nClub, and all without making a profit,\nI would guess that the central funding\nisn\u2019t enough to run the service. Indeed,\nit seems that most of what the Careers\nService does is a sponsorship opportunity for companies.\nAnd this is what I mean by privati-sation. Instead of funding the Careers\nService directly, the College prefers to\nsave money by letting companies pay\nfor it, to the apparent detriment of stu-dents: when so many students see advertising as endorsement, this is a very\ndangerous position.\n\u201cThe Careers Advisory Service\naims to ensure it caters for all student\nneeds,\u201d according to Farrar. But can it\ndo this under the current funding sys-tem?\nThe situation will get worse before it gets better. The Government\u2019s\nHigher Education White Paper insists\nthat universities must do more to promote \u201cemployer sponsorship\u201d in order\nto \u201cmake the UK the best place in the\nworld for university-industry collaboration.\u201d Perhaps Imperial will start\nawarding corporate-sponsored de-grees, as the same piece of legislation\nrecommends.\nSo what can we do? Not much I\u2019m\nafraid, though some small victories\nhave already been won. Last term, I\ncomplained that there was no way of\nopting out of Targeted Emails, as none\nof the emails up to that point had offered me the choice.\nElspeth Farrar told me that \u201c Students can opt out of receiving these,\u201d\nand from that point on, all Targeted\nEmails asked whether I wished to un-subscribe. A small thing, yes, but public pressure can make a difference.\nThe real question is whether we can\nconvince the University to give more\nmoney to the Careers Service, and I\nsuspect the answer is no (why would\nthey, when other universities don\u2019t?).\nStill, it\u2019s worth a try!\nA fully referenced version of this article\nis available at rustylight.blogspot.com\n\n"
