    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX\n22\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nAlbum of The Week\nThe Streets\nComputers and\nBlues\n2011\nMike Skinner\u2019s music is like Marmite, you either love\nThe Streets or you hate them. You can however, hate\nthem and over time learn to love them, which is exactly what happened to my opinion of The Streets,\nafter listening to this new album Computers and\nBlues. I must say that this is an excellent album, considering I was expecting the worst. Typically honest\nlyrics are displayed with exceptionally smart rhythm,\nflowing almost like a rap with well thought construction of phrases, that gives the vocal line its distinctive Streets sound as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard before.\nProgessing his UK garage sound over the years, this\nalbum puts everything in a far more optimistic perspective than previous albums: Original Pirate Material and A Grand Don\u2019t Come For Free. Looping pianos\nand synth-sounds provides its garage basis and mel-low, feel-good choruses interject the speedy drum\npad rhythms to come wondefully together in a highly\nemotional piece of work. It is undeniable that Mike\nSkinner\u2019s work truly comes from the heart, and that\nis what music should be all about, not the money. So\nI applaud The Streets for their genuine, inspirational\nalbum, and for converting me to a future of enjoying their back catalogue, a hell of an album for The\nStreets to bow out on. Luke Turner\nMost listened to\nthis week by\nFelix Music\nmembers on\nlast.fm\nMake sure not to miss\nChase and Status\nThhe Roundhouse\nFriday 11th March 2011 (tonight!)\nI\nf you are even remotely interested in\nmusic, and regardless of your stylistic preferences, then there is a strong\nchance you have heard of Odd Future\nWolf Gang Kill ThemAll by now (Odd\nFuture for the lazy). If you have not, then you\nmust be living under a rock somewhere with no\nwi-fi, phone or carrier pigeon service. Freak.\nOver the past year this group of teenagers has\nbeen making serious ripples left and right all\nover the Internet. Case in point: since uploading his new single \u2018Yonkers\u2019 on YouTube just\nunder a month ago, leader of the Wolf pack Tyler, The Creator has racked up 2,700,000 views\non that song alone. Kanye West has finally spoken out about OF, proclaiming the insanely entertaining black-and-white video for \u2018Yonkers\u2019\n\u2013 directed by the 19 year old Tyler himself \u2013 as\nthe best video of 2011. It may be a little early\nfor that sort of declaration, but Yeezy makes a\nserious point.\nOdd Future is a collective of 17 to 23 year\nolds, making some of the most interesting music out there today. The most incredible fact\nabout this band is that they have not sold a\nsingle record yet, despite releasing four mixtapes and eight albums through the Odd Future\nTumblr page. Consisting of rappers Tyler, the\nCreator, Hodgy Beats, Earl Sweatshirt, Domo\nGenesis and Mike G, Casey Veggies, singer\nFrank Ocean and producers Left Brain, The\nSuper 3 and Syd the Kid, already have an insane back catalogue of 250 songs so far, most\nof which are sick.\nFor anyone not initiated to the group, I would\nsay the best possible place to start is Tyler and\nHodgy\u2019s first television appearance on Jimmy\nFallon a few weeks ago. Since being broadcast\nthe performance has been echoing throughout\nthe interwebs. It is a raw, visceral rendition\nof their old hit \u2018Sandwiches\u2019, performed on a\nstage decorated with garden gnomes. Backed\nby The Roots (which in itself says enough\nabout how huge these guys are quickly becom-ing), the two rappers hit the stage in skimasks,\nstanding next to some random freaky chick\ndressed as Samara from the 2002 horror flick\nJoin in at: http://www.last.fm/group/Felix+Music\n1.

Kanye West\nOdd Future killed them all\nOr how a bunch of teenagers are taking over the world\nThe Ring. The set starts off weird enough, but\nwhen the chorus of the song hits (featuring a\ngang chant-like repitition of two words: \u2018Wolf\nGang\u2019) it feels like a goddamn tidal wave. The\nvideo is a masterclass in how to execute a perfect first TV appearance, scaring the hell out of\nWhite America in the most offensive way pos-sible. OF bring hip-hop back to the basics of\nwhat made Eminem so succesful and exciting\nback in his heyday.\nThe Fallon appearance perfectly illustrates\neverything that is so exciting about Odd Future: they ally the twisted soul and energetic\nperformance of metal with urban beats and\nclever (albeit over-the-top) lyrics. They aim to\nshock, and achieve this goal with bravado in\nan age in which we are all pretty much desen-sitised. I would go as far as calling them the\nnew rock n\u2019 roll. Parents and religious authorities will forever hate them for the shocking descriptions of rape and carnage; kids will love\nthem for their portrayal of teenage angst and\nthe nihilistic, \u2018fuck it all\u2019 attitude that crowds\nflocked towards Nu-metal acts such as Slipknot\nand KoRn for a decade ago.\nYet at the same time there is something\nunique and refreshing about them: as a collabo-ration-heavy collective, each member manages\nto exude his own quirkyness whilst the releases\nretain an overall cohesiveness throughout.\nWhether it is the \u2018dystopian weed-rap\u2019 of\nDomo Genesis, the pretty-boy gangbangin\u2019 of\nHodgy Beats or the mature lover crooning of\nFrank Ocean, each member has a distinct personality and sound that is communicated bril-liantly, making each crossover collaboration all\nthe more exciting.\nThere is no doubt that OF\u2019s rise to fame is\ngoing to be accompanied with its fair share\nof hype (\u2018the new Wu-Tang\u2019 is being tossed\naround far too much) and the obligatory hip-sters. But this time the hype is justified, and\nthese kids have a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour that will keep them grounded. As for the\nhipsters, Tyler actively encourages the formation of violent mosh-pits at their gigs, so they\nprobably won\u2019t stick round for too long. Their\nloss. Greg Power\nFriday 11 MARCH 2011\nThe Strokes\u2019 new album is coming!\nOne of the most popular rock bands of the\ntime The Strokes, have confirmed that they\nwill be releasing their new album titled Angles on the 21st of this month in the UK via\nRough Trade. There has been much speculation and anticipation of this album following their 2006 release, First Impressions Of\nEarth. Many snippets and samples of songs\ncan be found on the net including the first\nrelease from the album, \u2018Under Cover Of\nDarkness\u2019. Watch this space.

    "content": "17\nCOM M ENT\nWhats wrong with\nthe new generation?\nGames. They\u2019re like gigantic,\nelectric playgrounds. And like\nplaygrounds, nowadays they\u2019re\nall tarmac and cutesy wooden\nhouses for the reception kids\nto play in, whereas we were\nlucky to have a bit of rusty old\npipe to play catch with. At least\nthat\u2019s the impression I get\nfrom Alex Karapetian\u2019s article\nin Monday\u2019s Daily Felix, which\nseemed to imply that games\nare less engaging, less addicting and less related-to-cartoon-series than they used to be.\nDespite understanding this\npoint perfectly, I\u2019ve seen videogames grow and evolve over\nthe last decade into something\nunrecognisable. There are now\nlarge communities using them\nas art forms, engines for societal change, medical tools,\nlearning aids, and most importantly a way to stave off boredom and entertain the mind.\nI\u2019m happy to see gaming move\non. Alex\u2019s point is representative of how he feels; how many\npeople his age feels. But it\nshouldn\u2019t be a judgement on\ngaming itself.\nTo say that gaming has\nchanged, and that we\u2019ll no\nlonger have tacky card game\ntie-ins, is probably true. But to\nsay that this is a bad thing, or\na sign of a weaker generation,\nis wrong. My brother\u2019s gen-eration, ten years behind me,\nbonds through discussions of\nguns and special forces, rather\nthan swords and sorcery. But\nthe fifty hours he spent honing his quickscoping is no dif-ferent, really, to the fifty hours\nI spent running Final Fantasy\nVIII. And at the heart of it is still\nthe same human enjoyment of\nplaying.\nWhat\u2019s exciting is that it\u2019s not\njust the upcoming newer generations who are shaping the medium today, but also people of\nall ages who are slowly finding\nthe right games and platforms\nfor them. As more people join,\nwe\u2019re going to see even more\ndiversification. But we\u2019ll all still\nbe sharing in something that,\npsychologically, is very similar\n\u2013 playing.\nSo here\u2019s to moaning about\nthe younger generation. But\nalso a reminder that the games,\nlike the kids, are alright.\nAngry Geek\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\nIS OUR SOCIETY\nACTUALLY LESS\nHOMOPHOBIC?\nA\nlthough homosexuality\nwas legalised in England\nin 1967, the views of the\npeople in the UK hardly\nchanged at all. Those\nwho came out as gay, acted gay, or were\neven remotely \u2018metrosexual\u2019 were still\ndiscriminated against for many years.\nOver time, the work of groups such as\n\u2018Stonewall\u2019 and School\u2019s Out managed\nto promote anti\u2013discriminatory laws and\nregulations, and the lives of gay people in the UK improved dramatically.\nSchools however were a completely different story; being gay was synonymous with\nbullying and schools and the police mostly ignored it. For many years children were\nteased, bullied and even driven to suicide, and the police and teachers stood by and\nlet it happen. Anti\u2013homophobia campaigns in schools and the teaching of the past\ntaboo subject of gay people have changed that, and schools have become much less\ntolerant of any form of bullying, giving children the chance to explore their own\npersonalities, rather than the personalities that other people demanded of them.\nMy personal experience in school was far better than I expected, I came out as gay\nwhen I was sixteen in my final GCSE year. I was scared of what would happen\nthanks to things told to me by friends and stories in the media, but I was not bullied\nfurther then the occasional name calling of being camp (which is an understate-ment!). I understand this view is not the same for every school and every person in\nthe country but I went to a state school in one of the toughest areas in east London,\nand felt safe. The only reason I didn\u2019t come out earlier was because of the scare\u00ac\u2013\nmongering that people in the media, like Johann Hari, do.\nOverall, police also started taking homophobic hate crimes seriously too; they\nstarted getting reported when people finally realised that other people would listen.\nStatistics indicate an increase in hate crime, but this is due to people realising that\nthey don\u2019t have to take that sort of abuse in this country, despite the media\u2019s constant\nbarrage of warnings.\nMany gay people in the media also claim that young kids use the term \u2018gay\u2019 as a\nderogatory phrase and are therefore homophobic. I argue that this is stupid and that\nthey should get a life. The term \u2018gay\u2019 meant happy long before it was attributed to\ngay people. To quote Stephen Fry, \u201clanguages change and evolve just as animals do;\nto think that they should always stay the same is a fallacy\u201d. You can\u2019t argue that what\nyoung people say has any bearing on its original meaning, given that most kids don\u2019t\neven know the original meaning.\nIn summary, homophobia is not increasing amongst young people, only the media\nsees it that way and forces children to believe it. As soon as people realise that it\u2019s\nthe media that sets these things off in the first place then maybe we\u2019ll see a better\nsociety overall.\nStuart Haylock Chris Socha\nOur society is pretty tolerant of all lifestyles, right?\nJohann Hari recently exposed the rise of homophobic\nincidents in East London. The question is...\n\u201cHate crimes started\ngetting reported\nwhen people realised\nthat others would\nlisten\u201d\nT\nwelve years ago, a nail\nbomb exploded in a gay\npub in central London,\nkilling 3 and injuring 70\nmore; nowadays the pub is\nregarded as an iconic landmark of the\nlast in a series of attacks on the capital\u2019s\nminority groups.\nDespite recent advances in LGBT\n(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender) rights in UK law, recent statistics\non homophobic hate crime can be interpreted to show an increase in crimes against\nLGBT people. One in five lesbian and gay people in Britain have been a victim of\none or more homophobic hate crimes in the last three years. Three in four of these\ndid not report them to the police. These incidents ranged from regular insults on the\nstreet to serious physical and sexual assaults. While some argue that this is because\nthe police have become more \u2018gay friendly\u2019 and approachable, campaigner Peter\nThachell suggests \u201cAs more people come out they become more visible and more\neasily identifiable. I remember there was a similar backlash in the US in the 60s, a\nbig rise in racist attacks in the wake of the civil rights movement.\u201d\nNow if we\u2019re examining homophobia among young people, one good way is to\nlook for relevant information within schools and colleges. Research in Stonewall\u2019s\n\u2018The Teacher Report\u2019found that nine in ten secondary school teachers and more than\ntwo in five primary school teachers say children and young people, regardless of\ntheir sexual orientation, currently experience homophobic bullying, name calling or\nharassment in their schools. It\u2019s scary to think that almost 90% of teachers regularly\nhear the phrases \u2018you\u2019re so gay\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s so gay\u2019 and other insulting homophobic\nremarks such as \u2018poof\u2019, \u2018dyke\u2019, \u2018queer\u2019 and \u2018faggot\u2019.\nIn many cases these can be picked up from parents or celebrities (Chris Moyles\u2019\n\u201cgay\u201d ringtone) who may be homophobic, or may just not understand that what they\nare saying is offensive, because unfortunately \u2018gay\u2019 is used as a catch\u2013all negative;\nfor anything from bad, wrong, weak, to pathetic, fake or overly\u2013emotional.\nThis is why (despite what Melanie Phillips may say...), \u2018School\u2019s Out\u2019s attempt\nto introduce LGBT elements into the curriculum is important! One school in Stoke\nNewington has developed lessons on gay historical figures who suffered persecu-tion, which has succeeded in \u201cmore or less eliminating homophobic bullying\u201d in its\nclassrooms and playgrounds over the last five years. The homophobia problem is\neven worse in faith schools, as columnist Johann Hari explains \u201cToday, schools in\nMuslim areas like Tower Hamlets and across Europe are deeply reluctant to explain\nthat homosexuality is a natural and harmless phenomenon that occurs in every human society: they know that many parents will go crazy. Tough.\u201d I could go on and\non with my argument, but in summary: homophobia is rife among our youth, and\nunless we do something about it, this is not something which will change.\n\u201cOne in five gay\npeople have been a\nvictim of homophobic\nhate crimes in the\nlast three years\u201d\nFELIX Friday 11 MARCH 2011\n\n"

    "content": "L\nast Thursday, the Muslim\nStudent Council hosted\nan event entitled: \u201cMiddle\nEast: Revolution, Democratisation, and the End of\nU.S. Hegemony.\u201d The evening featured\nfour invited speakers, talking about recent events in their home countries:\nSaeed Shehabi from Bahrain, Monjia\nAbidi from Tunisia, Kamal El-Helbawy\nfrom Egypt and Guma El-Gamaty from\nLibya.\nEach speech (with the notable exception of Mr El-Gamaty\u2019s) consisted pri-POLITICS\n15\nThe Middle East protests are secular\n\u201cThese modern,\nliberal youth are\noverwhelmingly\nsecular\u201d\ngage with them, they could not acquire\nany legitimacy.\nTake, for instance, the title\u2019s strident\ndeclaration of \u201cthe end of U.S. hegemony.\u201d A fairly strong argument can be\nput forward for the quasi-imperialistic\nnature of American foreign policy in\nthe Middle East. But because everyone\nalready seemed to be in agreement on\nthis, none of the speakers even both-ered. Rather than discuss and explore\nthe background and nuances of the\nsituation, the influence of America\nwas simply a tacitly assumed (though\nnot at all well-defined) fact. This was\nfinally challenged in the far-too-short\nQ&A session, when a member of the\naudience made the very good point that\nthe instigators, collaborators and beneficiaries of dictatorship in a particular\ncountry are themselves overwhelmingly citizens of that country. Unsurprisingly, this charge was not responded to\nadequately.\nThe evening had a religious slant\nfrom the start, even opening with the\nrecitation of a Koranic verse. Several\n(though not all) of the speakers ex-marily of a feverish, lengthy and somewhat tedious elaboration on the brutality\nof the dictatorial regimes. Whilst acknowledging these facts is important,\nthe insistence on rendering them in such\nminute detail unfortunately lowered the\ntone of the evening to one of indignant\nvictimhood.\nA related problem \u2013 a touch ironical\ngiven the title of the event \u2013 was the\nhomogeneity of the speakers. On almost all the major issues, the panel was\nunanimous: there was a total absence of\nhealthy debate. This might have been\nforgivable, had the purpose of the event\nbeen simply to present the experiences\nof a group of fairly remarkable individu-als. But of course this was not the case:\nthe incendiary title, together with the\noverall tone of the speakers, demonstrated that the event was aimed at making\ndefinitive judgements. Unfortunately,\nthe organisers failed to realise that any\nconclusion is meaningless when all the\nparticipants hold the same views. Indeed, there were several interesting and\nvalid points made by the speakers; but\nwith nobody on the opposing side to en-pressed their belief that the current uprisings are Islamic in nature. This is patently false. The disparate protests and\nrevolutions currently spreading across\nthe Middle East have just one thing in\ncommon: their youth. This vital de-mographic, frustrated from years of\noppressive government and lack of op-portunity, finally conscious of its own\nstrength, has shrugged off its shackles\nand is leading the revolt against tyr-anny. Each of the speakers lauded the\nyoung people for their crucial role in\nthe uprising. But these modern, liberal\nyouth, along with the movements they\nrepresent, are overwhelmingly secular;\nthey draw upon notions of national, not\nreligious, unity. To claim the incredible\nachievements of Tunisia and Egypt for\nIslam is at best misinformed, at worst\nplain malicious.\nAs mentioned before, the speakers did make a few fairly compelling\npoints. Mr. El-Helbawy highlighted\nthe hypocrisy of Western governments,\nwhich extol democracy while sanctioning the exclusion of particular parties\nfrom elections. Of all the speakers, Mr.\nEl-Gamaty was certainly the most interesting and engaging.

    "content": "9\nSCIENCE\nSci-Fi Column\nThis week I\u2019d like to talk about the\nBBC\u2019s newest science fiction series,\nOutcasts. Set in the near future it follows\nthe fortunes of a colony of humans on\nthe planet Carpathia who have fled the\nEarth to escape some as yet unspecified\nproblems on Earth.\nAfter a promising first episode, where\nCarpathia was established as a dangerous yet interesting place the show soon\nbegan to go downhill. The main problem is with the characters. The colony\u2019s\nleader, President Tate, was portrayed\nin the first episode as a noble idealist\nstruggling to build to a utopian society\non the planet. The audience, however,\nsoon found out that he had once ordered\nthe execution of an entire group of human clones because he wrongly thought\nthat they were carrying a deadly disease,\ndismissing the notion of quarantine as\n\u2018more unkind\u2019. I wouldn\u2019t have had\nproblems with this if not for the fact\nthat the show is structured so as to make\nthis deranged man the good guy. What\u2019s\neven worse is that when he reveals what\nhe did to the colony\u2019s inhabitants for\nsome reason nobody is outraged or calls\nfor him to be arrested or even at least re-sign. This could have worked if we were\nshown the colony considering the clones\nas sub-human but we weren\u2019t shown any\nreaction at all.\nNewly arrived on a transport from\nEarth is Julius Berger, the corrupt former head of the Earth evacuation project\nwho has proclaims that he has found reli-gion; worshiping some vague \u2018universal\nspirit\u2019. Despite having the feel of a slimy\ntelevangelist he somehow manages to\ngather a large following. What\u2019s worse\nis that even Dr Isen, the highly rational\nhead of police, begins to trust him, despite her knowing that that he effectively\nkilled somebody on the transport. Tate,\ndespite the colony having an advanced\nbrain scanner which could literally show\nall of Berger\u2019s memories of his crimes\nto the colony, instantly dispelling his\nfollowing, instead gives him a place on\nCarpathia\u2019s ruling council.\nI do not think, however, that we should\nbe too harsh with our judgements of\nOutcasts. The first seasons of Babylon\n5 and Star Trek: The Next Generation\nwere pretty bad and look at how these\nshows turned out. There is a lot of good\nin Outcasts, such as the mysteries of the\nvisions appearing to Carpathia\u2019s inhabitants and of what happened to Earth.\nOutcasts has the promise of becoming\nsomething we see so little of on televi-sion: an intelligent, slow-paced hard science fiction series with the focus on plot\nrather than action; something in the vein\nof the little known but brilliant Defying\nGravity. Unfortunately, declining viewing figures and mixed critical reception\nmeans that that Outcasts is very likely to\nfollow in the footsteps of Defying Gravity and be cancelled after its first season.\nFloods, fireballs and chaos?\nO\nf the four billion species\nthat have existed on the\nEarth, only 1% are still\naround today. Many of\nthese forgotten creatures\nbecame extinct gradually, slowly making way for new ones to evolve and\ntake their place. However, sometimes\nthe rate of extinction can increase so\nmuch that more than three quarters of\nthe world\u2019s species are lost in a short\nperiod of time.\nIt is tempting to imagine devastating\nscenes of fireballs, floods and chaos\nwhen we hear the phrase \u201cmass extinction\u201d, but the reality can be much more\nsubtle than that \u2013 so subtle that it could\npass by without much fanfare at all. In\nfact, some scientists think we could be\nin the middle of one right now.\nA mass extinction is defined as the\nloss of over three quarters of all species in a geologically short time period\n\u2013 around two million years, or less. This\nmay not sound short, but the Earth has\nbeen around for four billion years, making it is a fraction of a percentage of our\nplanet\u2019s total lifetime. There have been\nfive previous mass extinctions, known\namong palaeontologists as the \u201cBig\nFive\u201d. In a review published in Nature\nlast week, Anthony Barnosky and col-leagues, from the University of California at Berkley, brought together fossil\nevidence and recent paleontological data\nto work out whether we are in the middle\nof the sixth big extinction event of the\npast 540 million years.\nBarnosky and colleagues used several different methods to calculate the\nrate of extinctions that happened in the\npast in order to put what we see today in\ncontext. They used the fossil record to\nestimate plausible rates during the times\nof previous mass extinctions and then\ncompared this with what they estimate\nthe rates are now.\nThey found that although the recent\nloss of species is \u201cdramatic and serious\u201d, it is not yet, technically, a mass\nextinction. However, if all the animals\ncurrently classed as \u201ccritically endangered\u201d were to disappear, even if it took\n1000 years, it would tip us over the edge\ninto true mass extinction territory. If this\nwere expanded to include all animals\nin the \u201cendangered\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d\ncategories, we could bring about a mass\nextinction in just a few centuries.\nBarnosky and colleagues are quick\nto point out the shortcomings in their\nmethods. As most of the world\u2019s species have yet to be formally described,\ndocumented numbers of extinctions are\nlikely to be underestimates. The types of\nanimals that can be studied are also lim-ited. For example, it is only possible to\nmake direct comparisons between fossils and their modern day counterparts\nfor species that can be fossilised in the\nfirst place.\n\u201cObviously there are caveats,\u201d Barnosky said. \u201cWhat we know is based on\nobservations from just a very few twigs\nplucked from the enormous number of\nbranches that make up the tree of life.\u201d\nDespite these flaws, Barnosky and colleagues are confident in their conclu-sions.\nIt appears to be humans who are causing these devastating extinction rates,\nand Barnosky and collegues think we\nshould be doing something about it.\nComparing the Earth today with what\nscientists believe the Earth was like during the Big Five extinction events of the\npast, it looks like we are cooking up a\n\u201cperfect storm\u201d of conditions that are\nconducive to the catastrophic loss of\nMaciej Matuszewski\nspecies. Rapid climate change and an\nincrease in the amount of carbon dioxide\nin the atmosphere could both push many\nanimals towards extinction.\nDespite this, Barnosky is hopeful:\n\u201cWe still have a lot of Earth\u2019s biota to\nsave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to\ndevote resources and legislation toward\nspecies conservation if we don\u2019t want to\nbe the species whose activity caused a\nmass extinction.\u201d\nBoom! The scientific consensus is that the dinosaurs were killed off by an exploding meteor, but not all mass extinctions are this dramatic...\nKelly Oakes on how we could be in the middle of Earth\u2019s sixth\nmass extinction (and barely even notice)\n\u201cThe Big Five\u201d\nThe Ordovician event, ending 443\nmillion years ago, was made up of\ntwo bursts of extinction separated\nby a million years. Caused by a lowering sea level, it destroyed habitats along continental shelves,\nand glacially driven cooling.\nThe Devononion event ended 359\nmillion years ago. This event is\nthought to have taken a long time\nto occur and mainly affected marine life. It was caused by global\ncooling, followed by warming,\namongst other things.\nThe Permian event ended 251\nmillion years ago. Also known,\ncheerfully, as the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d,\nthis event is the most severe of\nthe Big Five. Global warming, vol-canoes, ocean acidification and\npossibly a meteor impact have all\nbeen implicated.\nThe Triassic event ended 200\nmillion years ago. Occuring just\nbefore Pangaea started to break\napart, this event is thought to\nhave cleared out ecological niches\nallowing the dinosaurs to become\ndominant. It was caused by an increase in atmospheric CO2 which\nincreased global temperatures\n(sound familiar?).\nThe Cretaceous event ended 65\nmillion years ago. The most infamous of all mass extinctions, this\none wiped out the dinosaurs. A\nmeteor exploding over the Earth,\nleading to global cataclysm and\nrapid cooling, is thought to be the\nlikely culprit.\nFELIX Friday 11 MARCH 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE\nFeatures Editor: Lizzie Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nsouthern-fairy/northern-monkey divide of England pathetic by comparison.\nBut even those 68 miles are nothing, a few\ninches on a map compared to the 6,000 mile\nmigration to Britain and the 40 years spent\nmaking it their home. That\u2019s a real, four dimensional shift, a Back-to-the-Future style alternate\nreality compared to the Pakistanis who carried\non back home. All geographical and class comparisons are just exaggerated by adaptations of\nMirpuris in this foreign land.\nSo far, so human. Wholesale migrations of\ncommunities are nothing new, and it is certainly not just Mirpuris who have settled here.\nI could talk about the reams of Punjabi Pakistani migrants, like my mum\u2019s own family from\nGujranwala or Phelwana da shehar, the \u2018City of\nWrestlers\u2019. This also explains my near-superhu-man strength. Or, I could talk about the Pakistanis who settled here after fighting alongside\nthe English during the war. Or the post-partition\nsense of freedom, of starting anew. I would\nmention those willing to work for a better life,\nwho came during the post-war years from the\nnewly-minted Pakistan into the open arms of an\nEnglish industrial boom.\nAll of these settlers helped build new Pakistani villages, ones carved into the urban coves\nof industrial towns in Yorkshire, Lancashire and\nthe Midlands. Ones with fewer donkeys. All of\nthem are responsible for a strange hybrid-culture\nof the Pakistani and British working class, one\nthat is both part of, and yet alien to its two parent countries. And all of them have brought up\nchildren here who embody this limbo commu-nity, not quite integrated enough into the British\nmainstream to stop referring to them as Johns\nor Gorey, but not desi enough to feel at home\non the Pakistan trips of their summer holidays.\nThese are the children of all Pakistanis. From\nthe hard-line religious to the hard-drinking\nF\nor an international student from\nPakistan, London is an explosion\nof new experiences. People form\nqueues, food is bland, the police\nactually care (but families hardly\nseem to), dogs are walked, old men jog, commuters are silent, \u2018smiling shop staff\u2019 are rarely\nas described, and under the ground men sit and\nlet women stand on tubes, whilst above it buses\nactually arrive on time. Compared to Islamabad, it might as well be Oz.\nWhat anchor can such a student reach for\nin this sea of change? Perhaps the Pakistani\ncommunities who settled here years ago, who\nstill cling on to their rocks of religion and tradition like barnacles in this cultural storm?\nNot quite. The Pakistanis here have changed.\nMany were originally from Mirpur, a land just\n68 miles from the people of Islamabad, but a\nworld away from their thoughts. A land whose\npeople are almost unknown to the rest of Pakistan, yet make up the overwhelming majority\nof Pakistanis here in Britain. And because of\nthis, it is a land whose future is now tethered\nto the insulated communities that have grown\nin England, a bond of people stronger than any\ninternational alliance or diplomatic gesture.\nEvery year another kind of Pakistani leaves\nhome to study in London. He is a British Pakistani, brought up here but on a solid foundation of Pakistani-ness, evident in his view of\npunctuality as a quaint pursuit of white people\nand his casual mistrust of British authority. His\nparents came from Mirpur but his home is in\nthose old industrial towns of the midlands and\nthe north. He comes to Imperial College, having worked hard to come to London, the big\ncity. It is the land of opportunity and diversity,\nof exciting events and important happenings.\nIt is crap. People are antisocial, no one drives,\nproper apna food is a rarity and tasteless frauds\nall too common. The fashion is over-flamboy-ant, cricket is under-revered, no one has any\ncommunity contacts and even fewer seem to\nhave common sense. Suddenly uprooted from\nhis community, from his Biradari, our man\nlooks for commonality in the university\u2019s Pakistani Society, one built, surely, upon the values\nby which he defines himself. One built upon his\ncode of Pakistani honour, of izzat, of unspoken\ncommunity, unbreakable pride and a nuanced\nlove for Doner Kebabs. Instead he meets some\nfreshies, educated Pakistanis fresh-off-the-boat\nfrom Islamabad, 68 miles from Mirpur but very\ndifferent in their character.\nWell, duh. A lot can happen in 68 miles. One\ncrosses the eastern border of the Punjab into the\nSouth-West of Azad Kashmir, the less disputed\npart of the highly disputed Kashmir region. One\nleaves the middle classes of Islamabad\u2019s airy\nstreets for the farms and fields of the Mirpur re-gion. The refined Urdu of newsreaders morphs\ninto rapid fire Potahari, or \u2018Mirpuri\u2019, and the\npeople harden from educated urbanites to the\nearth-wise people of the country. It makes the\nFrom Mirpur to the Midlands\nrudeboys, the focused student with dreams of\nstudying pharmacy or the relaxed school-leaver\nhelping his dad in the tyre shop. All are born\n(at an impressive rate) in all-Pakistani migrant\ncommunities. All suffer from the cultural confusion brought about by their circumstance.\nSo why the Mirpuri focus? Extremism. That\nis to say, Mirpuris, sometimes branded \u2018backward\u2019 by snootier migrants, often embody the\nidiosyncracies of \u2018Pakistanis\u2019 to their extreme,\nas well as the effects of the last 40 years A.B.\n(After Boat-trip). And numbers. Mirpuris make\nup a huge proportion of England\u2019s \u2018Pakistani\u2019\ncommunity. This severed limb of Pakistan has\nflourished, growing rapidly here in this foreign\nculture medium.\nCalling the Mirpur region a limb of Pakistan,\nhowever, is an exaggeration. It is at best a little\nfinger, making up just 0.13% of Pakistan\u2019s land\nmass and 0.22% of the total population. This is\nroughly equivalent to what the Isle of Wight is\nto Great Britain. Okay, so more a finger nail,\nthen, but one that has helped etch a thriving scene of markets, curry-houses and Asian\nfashion emporiums into the urban landscape\nof Britain. It is estimated that around 70% of\nthe 800,000 Pakistanis living in England are of\nMirpuri descent, and in towns like Bradford this\nraises to 90%. This has often made the people of\nMirpur the unofficial, unintended, but undeniable ambassadors of Pakistan in the U.K. I have\nbeen brought up in Birmingham (may it forever\nstand tall) all my life, but still had to readjust\nmy impression of what a Pakistani was when\nI met middle class and highly educated Pakistanis at university, who so differed to the desi\nMirpuri-Punjabi combo of the midlands. Using\nmy Talking-Real-English voice (full sentences,\nproper words, less grunts) with Pakistani peers\nat university is a novelty that still hasn\u2019t got old.\nBut bro, how did all this happen? It can\u2019t be denied that all the reasons for migration described\nearlier are important. But none of these are as\ndramatic as the 1967 construction of the Mangla Dam, the world\u2019s largest earth filled dam.\nIt was designed to increase water for irrigation\nand source more electrical power in Pakistan.\nOh, and it also submerged around 280 villages\nin the region, including Old Mirpur city, displacing 110,000 people in the process. Such collateral damage could not be ignored, and Pakistan\nquickly brokered a deal with a welcoming UK,\ngiving compensation, Mahfeza, to scores of\nmen. This took the form of get-into-England-free tickets, where they could go and work in the\ntextile mills and factories of industrial England.\nJust temporarily, of course. Just a quick fortune made and then an even quicker journey\nback to Pakistan, right? Right? How wrong they\nwere. England proved a more fertile land than\nthey could ever expect and, without realising it,\nthese men of the earth grew roots of their own.\nWe hope to delve into the concluding part of\nthe story \u2013 from big gangster attitudes to the\nLittle England of Mirpur \u2013 next week.\nOmar Hafeez-Bore and Kahfeel Hussain on how Pakistani immigration to the UK\nchanged not only this country, but parts of Pakistan and Pakistanis themselves\n\u201cJust a quick fortune\nmade and then an\neven quicker journey\nback to Pakistan,\nright? Right? How\nwrong they were.\u201d\nFELIX\nFriday 11 MARCH 2011\n6\n\n"

I\u2019d been writing it as part of TIGSource\u2019s\n\u2018VERSUS\u2019 competition, where over sixty\npeople developed games with a player-versus-player element in the months of February and\nMarch. I had a three-hour train ride ahead of\nme, and I sat down with some sample code and\nbent it all into shape. A few hours later, I have\nday one of IC.HACK ready and some words for\nyou to read.\nHopefully you got a chance to play the game\nthat came out of last week\u2019s romping through\nvideogame development. If you did, and if\nyou read the articles that go along with it, you\nmight have found things a bit lacking or hollow\nin places. That\u2019s because game development is\nhard, and try as you might you can\u2019t get much\ndone in a week. I slashed everything I could\nout of the development schedule, and managed\nto get some big, juicy core components into the\ngame by the end of the week, but if last week\u2019s\narticles achieved anything, it was merely to\nshow that it could be done, not that it could be\ndone well.\nSo why was I so eager to write these articles\nand try and fire up some interest in develop-ment? It\u2019s not because games development is\nan easy ride \u2013 it combines so many skills, from\nart to creative writing to programming, that\nthe chances of you being even average at all\nof them are astronomically small \u2013 it\u2019s because\nhaving gamers make games is really important\nfor the health of the gaming world.\nI can\u2019t think of a comparison that is suitably\npretentious, but if I were that kind of guy I\nmight liken it to speaking a language. As many\nof you will know, particularly those for whom\nEnglish is not a first language, keeping a language alive means using it often, bending it\ninto new shapes and finding new uses for it. In\nthe same way, we keep gaming fresh and lively\nby having people hacking out insane ideas in\ntheir spare time. Ideas that could never, ever,\never work in a million years \u2013 but then do. Procedurally generated worlds of lego-like blocks,\ngames that you control by shouting into a microphone at different volumes, games about\nhosting orgies to gain in the stock market.\nAs much as we might hate games like Farmville and its ilk, they have a role in the world of\ngaming \u2013 they bring new people in, teach them\nto play with friends and help them feel happy to\ntalk about games. The teen-focused worlds of\nhigh-pace shooters (which I\u2019m beginning to realise I am too slow to play any more) also help\nto keep gaming sexy and exciting to the world\nmedia. And the indie scene, always rumbling\nalong underground no matter what goes on\nelsewhere, is a furnace of exciting new ideas.\nAnd it always needs more firewood.\nSo it\u2019s going to take a bit of sweat and tears to\nget close to a really good finished game of your\nown, if you\u2019re interested in such a thing, and\nIC.HACK is in no way an example of one of\nthose. In fact, since finishing IC.HACK I\u2019ve put\naside the project that spawned it \u2013 Dungeonesque \u2013 in a fit of procrastination, so that I can\nstart on another pet project on the side. That\u2019s\na few weeks of spare time just archived in the\nblink of an eye.\nSo why do it? It might benefit gaming, but\nthat\u2019s not why you\u2019re going to want to give up\nyour Saturday morning. Chances are you\u2019ll do\nit because it\u2019s fun. Surprisingly good fun. In\nfact, every time I get a new prototype working or get a little dot moving on the screen for\nthe sixtieth time that week, I get a little burst\nof excitement. That sense of botching things,\nmuddling through to success and solving the\nproblems that come up along the way seems,\nfor me at least, to tap into the same reason I\nenjoyed my degree work in the first place.\nNot so much of a postmortem as a heart-to-heart, eh?

    "content": "19\nA R T S\nHeart-warming sketches from St Trinians\u2019 creator\nCecily Goodwin\nIn 1969, cartoonist Ronald Searle\u2019s wife\nMonica was diagnosed with a particularly virulent form of breast cancer and\ngiven six months to live. She went on\nto undergo a series of experimental and\nparticularly unpleasant chemotherapy\ntreatments.\nDuring this distressing period, Searle\nwas determined to do something to support his wife and has claimed \u2018I have\nonly my talent for drawing, so I drew\u2019.\nThe result is currently being exhibited,\nin association with many cancer and\nwomen\u2019s charities, in The Cartoon Museum under the title Les tres riches heures de Mrs Mole. These tokens of love\nand support were never meant for publication and consist of 47 pocket-sized\nimages detailing the potterings of Mrs\nMole, the alter ego of Monica, about\nher provencal residence. The house in\nwhich Mrs Mole is seen drinking tea\nand champagne, arranging flowers and\nadmiring views represents one the couple had bought a few months previous\nto Monica\u2019s diagnosis. Thus the life of\nMrs Mole is the idyllic life she might\npicture and look forward to during her\ntreatment.\nRonald Searle is regarded by many\ncontemporaries, and indeed introduced\nin the exhibition, as the greatest living\ncartoonist. The illustrator of Molesworth and St Trinian\u2019s, he has also\nworked for many high profile magazines\nincluding Life. He began his career detailing the horrors of the WWII Japanese\ncamps where he was held as a Prisoner\nof War for three and a half years. He still\ncontinues to draw, having celebrated his\n90th birthday last year.\nSearle\u2019s work is often associated\nwith a darkly mischievous humour, as\nshown in the misbehaviour and trickery of the St Trinian\u2019s schoolgirls and\nin the Molesworth cartoons. As in all\nhis cartoons, this collection wonderfully\nportrays the character of his subject, but\nin detailing the life of Mrs Mole, Searle\nonly portrays peace and content in the\npossible future represented by the draw-ings. The cartoons are full of hope and\nlight and Mrs Mole herself is delightful\nas she goes about her pastimes, planting,\npicking and arranging brightly coloured\nflowers, looking in her patchwork store\nand gazing at birds and butterflies that\nflutter about the terraces.\nThe exhibition ends with a cartoon not\npart of the series entitled \u2018The Beautiful\nDream comes True in which Mrs Mole\nAfghanistan\u2019s magnificent heirlooms\nAfghanistan. What images are conjured\nup in your mind? The sad reality is that,\nfor many of us, 3000 years of history\nhas been eclipsed by 30 years of chaos.\nFortunately the aim of the British Museum\u2019s exhibition Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World is to remind\nus of the country\u2019s crucial historic role\nas a junction of the silk routes between\nRome, India and China.\nI was initially disappointed by the ex-hibition. On entering, I was met by an\narray of Greek and Roman style pots and\nstatuettes which, while adequately making the point that there was extensive\ncontact between the Greeks and Romans\nand this part of the ancient world, didn\u2019t\nreally bring it to life for me. There didn\u2019t\nseem to be anything there unique to Afghanistan. The accompanying displays\nbrought the history a little more into fo-cus. Once part of the Persian Empire, it\nwas conquered by Alexander the Great\nwho, as always, took a local wife, and so\nAfghanistan found itself on the Eastern\nChristina Flanagan frontier of the vast Greek empire.\nMy impressions improved as I moved\ndeeper inside as there are some really lovely pieces which epitomise this\nunique fusion of East and West \u2013 in\nparticular a carving of the Greek goddess Aphrodite marked with a bindi, the\ntraditional Hindu symbol of marriage,\non her forehead, and a Roman glass\nenameled with a beautiful illustration\nof a Tiger. However, the third section\nis by far the most eye-catching. Gold\nabounds. This is the bling of three of\nAfghanistan\u2019s ancient nomad rulers,\nwhich they chose to be buried in. It is\nlaid out exactly as it was found when\narchaeologists first entered their tombs.\nThe haul includes the ultimate nomadic\naccessory: a portable folding crown of\npure gold and loads more stunning jew-ellery. Even the gold appliqu\u00e9 which\nwould have spangled their robes is carefully laid out alongside drawings which\nreconstruct the day\u2019s dress.\nFor me, the most interesting display\ncame at the end of the exhibition and\ndid not concern the ancient world at all.\nThe stories of how Afghanistan\u2019s treasures were safeguarded during the wars\nand turbulence that have wracked the\ncountry during the past 30 years \u2013 Soviet\ninvasion, civil war and Taliban regime \u2013\nare very moving. The Taliban famously\nblew up Afghanistan\u2019s giant Bhuddas, a\nseries of rock carvings up to 50m high,\nafter condemning them as idols. In order\nto evade such wrath, curators and archeologists concealed film reels behind false\nwalls, painted in watercolour over treasured oil paintings and stashed archaeological finds deep within bank safes.\nThe display features a set of beautiful ivory carvings featuring ornately\ndecorated and sensuously posed women.\nThey date from the 1st century AD and\nwere stolen from the National Museum\nof Afghanistan during looting in the\nearly 90s. They were recently identified\nand salvaged abroad and, thankfully,\nfollowing this exhibition they will be\nreturned, along with everything on dis-play, to the National Museum in Kabul,\nthe motto of which is, \u201cA nation stays\nalive when its culture stays alive.\u201d\nThe British Museum has clearly taken\na great deal of care over this exhibition.\n\u201cThis is the\nbling of three of\nAfghanistan\u2019s ancient\nnomad rulers\u201d\nS\nitting down in a dingy backroom\nof a pub in Camden, it seemed\nthat we the audience were to play\na more crucial role in this Hitchcock\nparody than previously anticipated. I\nturned to my \u2018Partner in Crime\u2019 and\nwryly noted that there were 13 members of the audience, indeed an unlucky\nnumber for the opening night of this\nperformance. Over the next twenty minutes we witnessed the murder, not of a\nhuman being (it was clearly a red handkerchief and not blood spewing from the\nactress\u2019s neck) but of the play itself.\nThe play was supposed to be a version\nof Hitchcock\u2019s classic Dial M for Murder, however this became condensed\ninto a twenty minute slot with plenty of\nother Hitchcock references thrown in,\nwhich didn\u2019t allow the audience to comprehend the fairly complex plot. There\nwere some redeeming points, including\nthe good quality of acting from some\nof the cast and some legitimately funny\nmoments. However overall this seemed\nto be more of a technical run through\nthan an opening night, with many of the\nsound effects being misplaced and the\nactors forgetting their lines. All in all\nthere was a very rushed feeling to the\nperformance, which ended abruptly and\nfairly inconclusively. So much so that\nthe audience would have been unsure if\nthere was an interval, had the cast not\ntaken their bows.\nAfterwards my partner and I sat in a\nSomebody\nkilled the\nshow\nKelly Osborne\nThe atmosphere is good, dominated by\nfull-wall photographs of the Afghanistan landscape, and there are some very\nshiny computer reconstructions. However, I find the student price of \u00a38 maybe\ntoo much for the relatively limited collection on show. It is, however, worth\nnoting that there are 2-for-1 tickets for\nstudents Friday 17.30 - 19.30.\nI love my new belt buckle...\nDial L for Latchkey, Pelas Theatre\nCompany was at Etcetera Theatre\nflies towards the open arms of Mr Mole\u2019.\nThis was produced a few months before\nthe Searles moved into their house in\nProvence previously only occupied in\nthe cartoons by Mrs Mole. After 5 years\nof difficult treatment, Monica Searle had\nsurvived the cancer and they have been\nliving there for the last 35 years.\nThe Cartoon Museum is charming,\nwell worth a visit in itself, and an ideal\nlocation for this exhibition. Searle\u2019s distinctive and masterful style is shown\nin the cartoons but they are uniquely\noptimistic and uplifting. The collection\nof small drawings, personal tokens of\nSearle\u2019s affection and concern for his\nwife, is genuinely moving, and I would\ngreatly recommend a visit.\nlocal authentic fried chicken restaurant\nchain and tried to solve the mystery of\nwhodunit?

The site,\nwhich allows you to enter a postcode and retrieve detailed crime statistics for the area, has\nbeen a massive success, receiving 400m hits in\nthe two months it\u2019s been online.\nThe site is a coordinated effort by various\ngovernment departments and has been hailed\nby ministers as a step towards greater transparency with regards to the working of your local\npolice force. In addition to providing a localised crime map, it also offers local police force\ninformation and a list of events being held by\nthe police in the area.\nThe site throws up little in the way of surpris-es; the Imperial-infested and expensive southwest of London is remarkably safe. Albertopolis itself is devoid of any crime, with the worst\nyou should be expected to endure is a case or\ntwo of the one-fits-all \u2018anti-social behaviour\u2019,\nsomething that you\u2019re probably used to at Imperial in any case.\nThe site has been surprisingly divisive, how-ever, with many people questioning the point\nin releasing crime data for individual streets.\nBeyond the voyeuristic pleasure of scouring\nsome of London\u2019s seedier neighbourhoods,\nthere is little that the information offers that\nwasn\u2019t publicly available a few months ago,\nand almost no functionality apart from it either.\nWhile it\u2019s certainly healthy fuel for paranoia,\nthere is also little you can do to get involved\nbeyond staring at you screen; there is no way to\nprovide feedback or suggestions to your local\npolice force through the site.\nThis lack of apparent purpose has led many\nto question whether the government really had\nto spend \u00a3300,000 on the project. Software architect Rob West took it upon himself to churn\nout a virtually identical website on the evening\nof the site\u2019s launch, managing it in roughly 8\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Opera Mini\nWith O2 and others blocking sites, now\u2019s the time to\nstart using a proxy based browser.

When you get to the\niPhone 4, those same soft silicon cases haven\u2019t\nreally evolved very much. Sure they have cut\nouts now so you can access the buttons and the\nports, but they\u2019re still pretty poor.\nThe Cygnett SecondSkin for the iPhone 4\nis no different. It\u2019s a quick and easy fit silicon\ncase that can be had in a variety of colours. In\nan attempt to differentiate it from the \u00a32 eBay-specials, Cygnett have included a screen protector in the package as a welcome extra.\nThe SecondSkin is marketed as having a\n\u2018soft, talky touch feel\u2019 and while it\u2019s slightly\nless tacky than your average silicon case, it still\nsuffers from the age old problem of pocket jam\nRubberise your iPhone 4 with SecondSkin\nSamuel Gibbs\nhours.\nSupporters of the site are overwhelmingly\npositive about it\u2019s performance however, and\nthe numbers seem to agree that whatever the\nreason, the website has managed to tap into our\nnatural curiosity. It is hoped that the effort will\nput pressure on local police forces to deal with\ncrime better, and allow residents to lobby for a\nbetter presence in more troubled areas.\nThe site is just the latest measure in the government\u2019s continuing effort to bring data and\ntransparency in their dealings to the public.\nDriven by the central hub of data.gov.uk, datasets released to the public include the \u2018Compendium on Motorcycling Statistics\u2019 and the\n\u2018Survey of Vegetables and Flowers\u2019. The idea\nis to bring accountability to the government\u2019s\nactions as well as allowing interested parties to\nanalyse and present the data in ways the government may not have thought of.\nDespite some very interesting figures having come out of the release of the data, there\nare still many questions regarding privacy that\nhave yet to be answered. The government contracts a large amount of work out to private\ncompanies, and it\u2019s a matter of debate whether\nthey are required to be as transparent.\nThe government doesn\u2019t have a great track\nrecord so far when it comes to opening up\ndata to developers either. TfL\u2019s London Underground API (which should allow users to\ncreate websites and apps for phones) is notoriously unreliable. Its basic functionality has\nbeen withdrawn unexpectedly multiple times\nover the last few years, much to the chagrin\nof developers who depend on it for their apps.\nWith the police.uk website going down on the\nday of its launch as well, it\u2019s clear that while\ntransparency may be the order of the day, it\u2019s\nmeaningless if the data is stuck on a server in a\nback office in central London.\nHead on over to the crime map to stare in horror at the nearest case of violent crime; I personally find the Compendium of Motorcycling\nStatistics gets me off faster.\nas there\u2019s simply too much friction. As a conse-quence, if you\u2019re wearing jeans, it can be pretty\ndifficult to get your phone out of your pocket\nwhen it rings, and when you do it\u2019ll be covered\nin fluff and dust.\nThe SecondSkin isn\u2019t as tightly fitting as you\nmight like either, and can come off in a loose\npocket, or bag. It\u2019ll also let a load of dust and\npocket debris get under the case, something\nthat Apple\u2019s worried is scratching and weakening the back glass of the iPhone 4. You can\u2019t\nreally get round that when you want a form-fit-ting case on your phone, but being a bit tighter\nand closer fitting could help.\nFor about \u00a315 it\u2019s not a bad case. It offers de-cent, if a bit thin, protection, while access to the\nbuttons and ports is decent. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a\nbad case, it\u2019s just not great or cheap.\n\u201cThe site throws up little\nin the way of surprises\u201d\n12\nWhat?

This clearly paid off as the Devils\u2019 first line opened with a goal by Liljegren\n(23), assisted by Barakat (11) and Nolan (53), 1\nminute into the first period. The game was still\nopen and both teams were still learning the play\nleading to a goal for Cambridge after a defensive mistake. Line changes were occasionally\nfumbled, but the Devils\u2019 Forwards took advantage of the more inexperienced Cambridge Defence to dominate the play. The Devils racked\nup 4 more throughout the first period by Walther Buel (87), Grabham (80), Barakat (11)\nand Jones (40). Constant pressure prevented\nCambridge from leaving their zone and setting\nup any play, odd breakaways were ably turned\naway by Devils\u2019 Defence.\nCambridge came back in the second period\nwith a new-found energy and challenged the\nDevils far more. Play went end to end and the\npuck was heavily contested. Devils\u2019 Forwards\nGuilds\nrugby\nday trip\nto Oxford\nMax Joachim\nC & G Ru g by\nC&G 44 - 29 Balliol College\nAfter a convincing win over the RSM last term,\nthe City & Guilds RFC took on Balliol College,\nOxford in the annual Gin match. It was to be\na day of records; the most number of referees\nseen in a rugby match and the greatest number\nof bottles of Gin drunk in one evening. The authoritative word of vice-captain Graeme Ridler\nstated that the team would meet at 11.50am\nonly for Ridler himself to arrive late.\nUpon safe arrival in Oxford, we swiftly made\nour way to the ground only to discover that no\nchanging rooms were available and, more im-FELIX\nFriday 11 MARCH 2011\nfell foul of the referee for physical play, but despite three separate penalties the Devils refused\nto concede on the Penalty Kill. With the final\npenalty ending in the third period the Devils\nwere back to 5 men and had an opportunity to\nmake up for the goal-less second period. Sadly\nthis was not the case as the Devils slowly disintegrated from lack of energy. Unnecessarily\nlong shifts and sloppy changes were causing\nthe Devils to lose focus and Cambridge seized\nthe chance using a breakaway to outskate the\nDefence and score. Still in the lead, this did not\nserve the wake-up call the Devils needed and\nCambridge managed another shortly before the\ngame was out. Overall, a win for the Devils; but\nwith the negative goal difference from the Spitfires still against us a 5-3 win was not enough.\nPlayer of the match was given to Goalie, Gemma Bale (84).\nAhand-picked team of two lines with the confidence of a previous win under their belts and\nably supported by Bench Coaches Matt Dolan\nand Tim Runcorn (numbers 28 and 36 of the\nA-Team, the latter also club President) stepped\non to the ice with the game in their hands. Immediately the Devils could sense Cambridge\u2019s\ntrepidation and despite their attempts to hide\nit the Devils pounced. Another early goal for\nImperial, Barakat (11) scored on a breakaway\nafter 4 minutes of fairly open play to set the\nIce Hockey: Double win for\nB team against Cambridge\ntone for the match. This was followed up with\n3 more in the first period; by scorers Jones (40),\nLiljegren (23) and Barakat (11) again.\nA confident first period, but the Devils were\ndetermined to score again and maintain momentum unlike the previous game. Wise words\nfrom Dolan and Runcorn saw the team with\nthe bit back between their teeth and ready for\nCambridge who appeared to have just warmed\nup for the second period (much like before).\nThe Devils maintained the upper hand but play\nwas slowly degrading into coarse physical contact and bad passes. Defender Matt Nolan (53)\nfought through to score his maiden goal of the\nseason, but this spurred Cambridge on. The Ref\nappeared to turn a blind eye to the girls\u2019 indiscretions and there were cries from the bench\nof foul play but the Devils soldiered on until\na forced defensive error let Cambridge put one\nin. Outraged the Devils next line took to the\nice and scored in return, a hat-trick for Barakat\n(11).\nIncensed, Cambridge took to dirty tactics targeting center, Liljegren (23), and holding her\ndown on the ice. As the non-checking league\nthe Devils were unsettled by rough play and\nwere not used to fighting as commonly occurs\nin A-Team games. However, they held their\nown and would not be dragged down, nor concede again for the rest of the game.\nportantly for Messers Joachim, Jinks and Hill,\nno toilets. The game finally got underway after\na two hour delay. It soon became clear that both\nteams wanted to play fast-flowing rugby with\nthe C&G having the upper hand in the first half\nscoring another 3 tries by Nicholas Johnstone\nand two tries by Scotsman Michael O\u2019Connell\nwho added an extra two points with a difficult\ndrop-goal conversion.\nAt half-time with C&G leading 24-0, the referee who was also the Balliol captain decided\nto get in on the action and handed over refereeing duties to another player. The second half\nwas a much tighter affair with the hosts finally\nputting together some good moves. Strong running by their 8 and 10 saw them dot down two\ntries to close the gap to 24-10 but soon after\nO\u2019Connell took his chance to seal his hat-trick.\nBalliol still didn\u2019t give up but the fierce C&G\ndefense held fast, led bravely by Jinks who\nmade a number of crunching tackles.\nTries by Ridler and Tom Beswetherick rounded off a 44-29 victory for the mighty C&G, not\nbefore a third referee was brought into the fray.\nThe victory meant that C&G remain unbeaten\nthis season.\nMan of the Match went to Jinks whilst Chris\nMcGeough reclaimed his beloved \u2018distinctly average performance\u2019 trophy. Johnstone\nsnatched the Twat of the Match award for attempting a ridiculous drop-goal kick, a trait he\nhas inherited from his brother.\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\n29\nE\nveryone seems to love Nandos. This makes actually\nwriting about the place a\nhealth hazard, so violent\nwould the backlash be\nfrom a negative piece. On the potential-trouble gauge used by Felix writers it\nis only topped by \u2018Doing a Review of\nthe Rector\u2019s Face\u2019. The situation for me\nis even more risky, living as I do with\none flatmate who would inject peri-peri\nsauce into his veins if he could, and two\nothers who would happily settle for just\nshowering in it.\nBut I can deal with them. What I can\u2019t\ndeal with is the 20% discount Nandos\ngives to NHS staff. Is this some kind of\nunspoken governmental policy to attract\nworkers to the NHS? Or is Nandos just\npositioning itself alongside Health as a\npillar of Britain; along with Education,\nMilitary and Stephen Fry? Now I don\u2019t\ndoubt that the discount leads to fewer\ndeaths at the hands of distracted, spicy-chicken-craving nurses. But the underlying message is clear: Nandos is not\nmerely a popular high-street eatery, but\na cog in the machinery of society itself.\nUnder this kind of pressure it\u2019s almost easier to crack and just rip Nandos\napart. I could be the cool, counterculture\nhipster who is, like, so not mainstream\nin his culinary taste. Or the broadsheet\nfood critic who judges restaurants\nagainst strange, metaphysical standards\nagainst which the actual food is too crass\nto consider.\nInstead I ate at Nandos as just my\nnormal awesome self. Being a thorough\nprofessional, I went three days in a row,\nand consulted with Nasif Mahmood and\nAli Kirresh, the famed Nandos Gurus.\nI visited both the Bayswater and Shepherd\u2019s Bush branches, and consumed in\ntotal about two whole chickens, a loaf\u2019s\nworth of garlic bread, a truckload of\nchips and enough per-peri powder to be\nlocked up for substance abuse. And you\nknow what? You can definitely have too\nmuch of a good thing.\nOr so I\u2019ve heard. Personally I\u2019d go\nagain right now if I could because Nandos. Is. Delicious.\nLike, crazy tasty. I hardly need to\nwhip out the ol\u2019 palette of adjectives, as\nfew reading this will need any description of the succulent, flame-grilled taste\nthat Nandos has down pat. I might as\nwell describe the colour red. Less well-known are the accessories to a meal\nthat are available; the spicy \u2018perinaise\u2019,\nthe creamy mashed potato, the veggie\npita mains and the choc-a-lot cake dessert (\u2018lovely\u2019 according to my sauce-injecting flatmate). Personally, I favour\nthe frozen yoghurt machine due to my\nchronic, debilitating dairy addiction\n(don\u2019t forget to play the who-can-bite-into-a-spoonful-of-frozen-yoghurt-for-the-longest game!).\nBut the chicken is the thing, and that\ndistinctive flavour has its own legacy.\nFor a start the peri-peri powder and\nsauce is actually made from the African\nBird\u2019s Eye Chilli of Mozambique. This\nwas a fiery revelation to the Portuguese\ncommunity that settled there, who later\nheaded to South Africa during the 20th\nCentury gold rush, their spicy-chicken\nrecipes in tow. Still serving said recipes\nin 1987 was a place called Chickenland\nin Johannesburg, which was bought\nby two impressed businessmen and renamed Nandos after one of their names\n(FerNANDO LOLZ!). Oh and apparently \u2018peri-peri\u2019, as legend has it, was\na Portuguese boy\u2019s mispronunciation of\nthe much loved chilli called \u2018pili-pili\u2019 in\nSwahili. Good man.\nI can confirm none of this. But frankly,\nif it was found out that Nandos chicken\nwas flame-grilled in the fires of hell by\nthe devil himself, people would still go.\nThey\u2019d feel bad and all, they\u2019d \u2018Like\u2019\nWho wants some chicken? I want some chicken. Give me some chicken. Buy me some chicken. Eat chicken now.\nThe Health Service\nOmar Hafeez-Bore shows us how chicken is not just a finger lickin\u2019 good sensation\nthe Facebook groups made to argue\nagainst the insensitivity of using Satan\nas a spokesman and all that, but guiltily they\u2019d still go and choose Nandos\nchicken and Nandos comfort.\nBecause that comfortable atmosphere\nis something to be reckoned with.\nDo not underestimate the joy in being\nable to pick your own sauces, and stand\nthem on the table like glass totems erected in honour of your spice-hardiness.\nNor undervalue the way you order food\nin units of chicken (1/4, \u00bd or whole),\nthereby removing the embarrassing eat-ing-out guessing game of which of the\nstrange foreign words will actually give\nthe biggest portion. And certainly do not\nignore the primal pleasure of eating with\nyour hands in a rustic, wood-craft envi-ronment, tapping into deep psychological wells of warmth and homeliness.\n\u201cIs Nandos just\npositioning itself\nalongside Health as\na pillar of Britain;\nalong with\nEducation, Military\nand Stephen Fry?\u201d\nThese are what define the Nandos ex-perience, as much as the food itself. It\nis wondrous alchemy, a combination of\nsmall things that combine to make a reliably good eat-out.\nBut what really makes Nandos the\njewel in the high-street crown, is the variety of people who actually eat out at\nthis eat-out. Does any other restaurant\nchain have as wide an appeal? Black\nguys visit because it\u2019s like the spicy Jerk\nChicken they love (Well, Chipmunk\nsays so) whilst health-conscious business yuppies go because grilled chicken\nfits in with their protein regime. Children adore the bottomless DIY drinks,\nteens treat it like a trendy upgrade of the\nfried-chicken shops they are used to and\nPakistani families like the Halal meat\nused in over 50 of the 233 UK Nandos\nrestaurants.\nCorrection: Pakistanis love the Halal\nmeat. As a Birmingham-born-an\u2019-raised\n(half-) Pakistani I actually lived through\na major culinary revolution caused by\nNandos. Whilst previously the average\nBritish Muslim\u2019s experience of mainstream chains was an intimate knowledge of McDonald\u2019s fillet-o-fish, the\nopening of a halal Nandos in the Pakistani-packed Star City complex in Birmingham created a fervour never seen\nbefore or since. Whole communities\nwould flock to the branch en masse as if\npractising for pilgrimage. People would\nrevel in being able to eat the non-veg-etarian option at a bona-fide non-Asian\nrestaurant. Wizened elders could drench\ntheir chips in Extra-Hot and just pretend\nit was an alloo curry whilst second generation youngsters could join in their office socials without having to get their\nmeat fix from the kebab shop on the way\nhome. And though everyone from KFC\nto GBK have now jumped on the halal\nband-wagon, it is their original saviour\nthey remain most loyal to.\nAs far as high street chains go, Nandos is a success. It has sunk into the British palate slowly and steadily, without\ncompromising its reliably high quality,\nhigh-taste food. Most importantly, it is a\nsuccess enjoyed by all, and one hard to\nbegrudge when the service is so friendly\nand its loyalty card is so rewarding.\nAs I started; everyone seems to love\nNandos. And so they should.\nP.S. I am aware of the debate over\nwhether Nando\u2019s chicken counts as\nHalal by proper criteria, but have yet\nto investigate. This article is in no way\nan endorsement of Nandos\u2019 Halal-ility,\nonly its deliciosity.\nNandos nationwide.\n(Ed - Just how we like it. I have an immense Nandos craving now...)\nFELIX Friday 11 MARCH 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nHammer Horror\u2019s\npredictable return\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector Antti Jonkinen\nScreenwriter Antti Jonkinen, Robert Orr\nCast Hilary Swank, Jeffrey Dean Morgan,\nLee Pace, Christopher Lee\nThe Resident\nJohn Park\n24\nJokinen doesn\u2019t spend much time trying to engage the audience in a guessing game. Anyone\nwho has seen the poster will notice Morgan\nstanding over Swank giving a scary, glaring\nlook. If that is not a dead giveaway, it\u2019s hard to\nknow what is. Plus the film doesn\u2019t even attempt\nto throw the viewers in the wrong direction\nwith red herrings. We meet Max\u2019s grandfather\n(Christopher Lee) and although he is the classic\n\u2018creepy old man in a horror film saying ambiguous things that don\u2019t make sense,\u2019 it\u2019s clear his\nailing body could not possibly keep up with psychotic activities. Could the cause be supernatu-ral? Nope, because even the trailer disproves\nthis theory. So the bottom line is, Morgan is the\nvillain and there is no tension surrounding it.\nNot a lot of explanation is given about Max\u2019s\nstate of mind and obsessive personality. A few\nrushed flashbacks of disturbing images, newspaper articles and ominous voiceovers try to\nset up a history for him but it\u2019s not enough.\nTo make an effectively disturbing psychopath,\nthere needs to be plenty of sound, logical ex-planation, or none at all. Anything half-hearted\ndoesn\u2019t work and begs the question of \u201cwhy\nbother?\u201d A few references to Max\u2019s messed up\nchildhood don\u2019t explain a lot and are unimpressive to say the least. For a guy who must have\nbeen doing things like this for years, his methods can be shockingly careless at times, which\nadds up to more disappointment.\nLee Pace makes a pointless cameo appear-Why the two-time Academy Award winning,\nmuch-respected actress Hilary Swank thought\nshe needed to do another cheap horror after the\nnot so well received The Reaping is anyone\u2019s\nguess. But before you immediately dismiss this\nas another scare-free \u201chorror\u201d film, just know\nthat the film is not without its moments, and\nalthough everything is predictable almost to\nan annoying level, creepy moments do pop up\nevery now and then. Thankfully it\u2019s a relatively\nshort film too \u2013 only around 90 minutes \u2013 so if\nyou\u2019re willing to bear the frustrating moments\nfor a few scenes that do truly pay off once in a\nwhile, this might be the laid-back, thoughtless\nentertainment we all need occasionally.\nThere are, of course, much better, much\nscarier films out there, and there is nothing\noriginal about the \u201chaunted house\u201d theme of\nThe Resident. Creaky doors and odd noises are\nthe least of Juliet\u2019s (Swank) problems when she\nmoves into her new, spacious New York flat;\nits pricing suggests that it\u2019s too good to be true.\nIt is in fact, since Juliet is very soon stalked\nby her psychologically troubled landlord Max\n(Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Whenever she drinks\nwine, sleeps, or takes a bath (these seem to be\nthe only things Juliet ever does in her new flat),\nthere is a disturbed pair of eyes, combined with\nheavy breathing following her through the intricately adjusted space behind the walls.\nIt\u2019s a good thing first-time film director Antti\nClassic Cinema\nFargo\nSometimes the Oscars are a little controversial. However, Fargo fully deserved the two it was awarded in\n1996 for Best Actress and Best Original Screenplay.\nThe film is the story, marvellously told by the Coen\nbrothers, of a car salesman, Jerry. This salesman,\nplayed by William H. Macy, is strapped for cash and\nso hires two thugs to kidnap his wife for a ransom\nfrom his rich father-in-law. Now if ever I heard a plan\nwhich simply cannot go wrong, that\u2019s it.\nAfter the death of three people, Police Chief Marge\n(Frances McDormand) starts investigating. She is\nnot the clich\u00e9d wise-cracking super-cop found in so\nmany films. In fact this film is, refreshingly, totally\nabsent of clich\u00e9. She is a seven month pregnant,\ncoffee-drinking woman who is in a genuinely loving\nrelationship. She also happens to be a very intelligent policewoman, as she painstakingly investigates\nthe triple murder. From the outset, she is depicted as\nvery human. Her encounter with the crime scene reminds us of this as she suddenly switches from hungry to doubled over about to vomit and back again\nto hungry \u2013 the Coen brothers demonstrate that she\nis as vulnerable and hormonally maladjusted as any\npregnant woman.\nSubtlety is this film\u2019s watchword. The final message of Fargo is very easy to miss, and the tension\nand drama is not accompanied by massive crescendos from an overworked score. Instead, everything is\nderived from the exquisite screenplay, providing great\ndark humour and excellent characters. As well as the\ndriven policewoman and the hapless car salesman,\nthere\u2019s the belligerent businessman father-in-law\nand the two hired thugs. These thugs are another\nhighlight of the film. One, played by Steve Buscemi,\nis hilariously described as \u201ckinda funny-lookin\u2019\u201d and\ngets increasingly wound up as the plot progresses.\nThe other, Peter Stormare\u2019s character, is depicted as\na menacing psychopath who usually communicates\nthrough grunts and stares, and whose actions are\nalmost exclusively threatening, violent or just downright unpleasant. The strained relationship between\nthese two, typified by the one-sided conversation\nthey have during the car journey to kidnap the wife, is\na memorable source of constant tension.\nThe real beauty here is the understatement of all\nthe drama: there are no huge explosions, no fast-paced adrenaline-driven car chases but it still manages to be a gripping and very human thriller laced\nwith dark humour.\nGuy Needham\nMarge Gunderson, you\u2019re a real super lady...\nance as Juliet\u2019s on-and-off boyfriend and\nChristopher Lee\u2019s talent is also wasted here:\nthe 88 year-old veteran is somewhat involved\nin Max\u2019s background story but that alone is not\nenough to justify his presence in the film. Pace\nhas hardly any dialogue, and what he has is a\nvery clunky, tacky set of lines delivered unconvincingly by the weakest actor in the cast.\nBoth lead actors are more than qualified for a\nfilmlikethisandtheyquiteeasilybreezethrough\ntheir roles. Swank\u2019s looks of absolute fear are\neffective, as are her expressions of shock and\ndisgust as she begins to discover the dark secret\nthat surrounds her new flat. Morgan\u2019s character\nhas the tendency to show up out of nowhere, a\nwell-worn technique used over and over again\nbut oddly it works, largely thanks to the confined and grim nature of Juliet\u2019s New York flat.\nMax\u2019s sexually frustrated, predatory actions are\ncaptured well by the fragile-looking Morgan,\nand so despite the limited depth to his character,\nhe keeps the tension going as much as possible\nthanks to bringing more to the screen than what\nthe script originally required of him.\nThe Resident marks the wave of films signaling the return of the Hammer Film Productions Company, but as its comeback film, the\nnew horror doesn\u2019t help its reputation. For an\norganisation that once dominated the horror\nmarket in the past, it\u2019s a disappointing effort,\nand doesn\u2019t come close to capturing the goth-ic-type atmosphere their best films are known\nfor. Logic is the last thing you would find in\na mindless film like this one, and although\nthe gruesome final showdown that marks the\nfilm\u2019s climax that we knew was coming from\nthe start is a wholly acceptable one, it turns out\nto be an unoriginal effort. It\u2019s predictable, and\ndespite the good performances of its absolutely\nspot-on cast, they are largely reduced to something entirely forgettable.\nTake out the goddamn trash!!!\nHilary Swank is hungry for nose\n\u201cThis might be\nthe thoughtless\nentertainment we all\nneed occasionally\u201d\nFELIX\nFriday 11 MARCH 2011\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\n14\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nRajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nUnited States\nThe Head of Libya\u2019s rebel movement has said that\nGeneral Gaddafi will not be persecuted if he quits\nwithin 72 hours and stops bombing his country-men. This comes as Libya\u2019s rebellion entered its\nthird week with the Gaddafi government counterattacking in several key cities. General Gaddafi is\nstruggling to hold on to his grip on power but there\nare signs that he may be willing to resign in return\nfor dropping the charges against him and a guarantee that he would be allowed to exit safely. International pressure is building up on Gaddafi and the UK\nand France is currently drafting a UN Resolution for\na no-fly zone in Libya which is supported by the Gulf\nStates and the Organisation of Islamic Conference.\nLibya\nUS President Barack Obama is lifting a two year\nban on military trials for detainees held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. This move is the latest signal to\nmany that Guantanamo Bay will remain open in the\nnear future despite Obama\u2019s pledge to shut it down\nwithin one year of taking office. Mr Obama has said\nthat this move would broaden America\u2019s ability to\nbring terrorists to justice. It is expected that Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of bombing the USS Cole\nwill be the first to be tried under Obama\u2019s new order.\nMalaysia\nMalaysia\u2019s Leader of the Opposition, Anwar Ibrahim has won a critical ruling in his second sodomy\ntrial. The Malaysian High Court ordered three pieces\nof evidence crucial to the prosecution\u2019s case to be\nexcluded after finding that they had been obtained\nincorrectly. This ruling means that the prosecution\u2019s\ncase will now rest solely on the testimony of the\ncomplainant Saiful Bukhari who claimed that he\nwas sodomised by Anwar in an apartment. Anwar\u2019s\nsecond trial for sodomy, which is illegal in Malaysia\nis seen by many as a political conspiracy with the\nHuman Rights Watch calling the trial a charade of\njustice.\nThe Cuban healthcare system is renowned for\nbeing one of the most effective healthcare systems in the world today with life expectancies\nequal to those of some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries. Cubans have for some time been\nmaking a push to reach out far beyond their\nsmall island borders in order to export their\nmethods of disease prevention and treatment\nworldwide, particularly in the developing\nworld where their impact is most noticeable.\nCuban medical international, otherwise\nknown as \u2018doctor diplomacy\u2019, is a Cuban programme founded after the Cuban Revolution in\n1959 that is aimed at exporting Cuban health\npractices and practitioners to developing na-tions. Rooted both in foreign policy objectives,\nincluding Cuba\u2019s policy of supporting anti-co-lonial struggles of the 1960s, and humanitari-anism, the programme today employs 50,000\nhealthcare personnel globally.\nAs one of the first countries to become active in medical crisis operations, Cuba has\ndispatched emergency assistance teams and\nmedical professionals to provide support to\nstruggling national governments after major\nnatural disasters and conflicts in Chile, Nicaragua, Iran, Algeria and Haiti since the 1960s, often arriving on the scene well before the large\nNGOs and Charities have mobilised. In 2005\nCuba even prepared to send a brigade of 1,500\ndoctors to New Orleans in the wake Hurricane\nKatrina; this offer was declined however by the\nformer US president George Bush.\nHumanitarian crises, although devastating when they occur, are rare, which is why,\nsince 1998, the Cuban Comprehensive Health\nFit as a Fidel\nRed Elmahdi (CPH) programme has formed the cornerstone\nof Cuban international health operations. This\nprogramme has allowed the Cubans to move\ntowards the establishment of durable international healthcare provisions and runs alongside\nits international emergency relief programme.\nThe CPH aims to promote international solidarity and bolster the public health infrastructure of a country through staffing local clinics\nand hospitals with Cuban medical teams.\nThe programme runs in 27 countries in Latin\nAmerica, Africa and Asia and as a result there\nare now health workers providing medical\ncare and assistance for some of the most isolated and deprived populations in the world.\nIn fact in several countries such as Honduras,\nGuatemala and Mali, CPH services have been\nthe only health service provisions available for\nmany rural and indigenous communities for\ndecades.\nThe Cuban approach combines population\nbased public health principles and preventative programmes with clinical medicine, formulating long-term healthcare initiatives and\ntaking these directly to the populations where\nit\u2019s needed. Since its foundation, the CPH is\nestimated to have sent 3,446 health professionals to participating countries. These personnel\nhave carried out over 96 million patient visits,\nsaved 1.8 million lives in the poorest parts of\nthe world and greatly improved the quality of\nlife of many more. This level of provision is\nwhat many large international health development programmes can only dream of achieving.\nThe price of such success is, however, high to\nthe individual practitioners who are deployed\ninternationally, and the question remains\nwhether such efforts are sustainable and scalable to reach more people. Availability of funding and resources however presents the largest\nobstacle to the CPH. These programmes are\nimplemented in the most deprived countries\nin the world and consequently the facilities\navailable to Cuban healthcare professionals are\noften poor, with frequent absences of essential\ndrugs and clinical equipment. These problems\nhave been minimised by increased efficiency,\nimproved logistics and informed human resource management but there is no denying\nthat there continues to be an absolute need for\nadditional funding that cannot be generated by\nthe deprived populations served.\nUnlike the usual aid and development programmes implemented by developed countries\nand large NGOs, which require significant\ninvestment and are largely vertical, running\nparallel to existing health facilities the Cuban\napproach of integrating health provision and\nstrengthening existing systems has been the\nkey to its success. Traditional health development programmes are often additionally limited by political alliance and ideology. Cuban\nprogrammes work in complete cooperation\nwith the poorest countries embracing ideas of\ninternational fraternity and disregarding political agendas and economic interest. The question now is how do they begin to convince the\nrest of the global health community to implement such methods?\nThe \u201cDeveloping Health Systems\u201d conference will take place on 26th March at 9.30\nin the Business School, comparing Cuba,\nthe UK and others.

It comes\nafter weeks of debate about the value of\nthe halls Amenities fund, which subsi-dises social events and is paid into by\nall students in halls. The survey asks a\nrange of questions including whether or\nnot students think that Ethos should remain free or not.\nImperial College Union said that the\nsurvey was intended to \u201cgauge student\nopinion on how they view their Halls\nexperience and to present some options\ngiven to us by College Commercial Services on how to reduce rents.\u201d\nHowever, a detailed breakdown of hall\nrents and where the money goes has not\nyet been released. Despite calls from\nstudents and efforts by the Union to get\nsuch information, the College has resisted releasing a breakdown or the mechanism by which rents are calculated.\nDirector of Commercial Services,\nJane Neary, declined to comment except\nto say: \u201cAll the services we provide are\nfinancially interdependent.\u201d\nFrom the respondents so far, over\n70% of students say that they want a full\nbreakdown of their rent on their bill.\nThe survey originally asked to students\nto rank the services that they receive in\nhalls in order of importance, including\nwater, electricity and heating. President\nAlex Kendall originally defended the\nquestion saying that they were all costs\nthat formed part of the halls rent but later\nremoved the question, admitting that it\nwas \u201cperhaps a bit stupid.\u201d\nA welfare survey has also been\nlaunched separately which asks students\na comphrehensive set of questions regarding all of Imperial\u2019s welfare servic-es. This ranges from the Health Centre\nto Personal Tutors. It also asks questions\nabout student depression and crime on\ncampus. Deputy President (Welfare)\nCharlotte Ivison said that she hoped the\nsurvey would lay the foundations for the\nfuture of Imperial\u2019s welfare services and\nthat it was \u201cthe most wide-ranging survey the Union has ever done.\u201d\nBoth surveys are available on the\nUnion\u2019s website, www.imperialcolleg-eunion.org. The Welfare survey is open\nuntil the 1st of April. The Halls survey\ncloses on Friday.\nKadhim Shubber\n\u00a39,000 fees conditions revealed\nIan Wei perial and Exeter. Oxford University has\nsaid that it would need to charge at least\n\u00a38,000 to simply \u201cmaintain the status\nquo\u201d, and many have warned that there\nwill a \u2018race to the top\u2019 as universities\nwill want to avoid damaging their image\nby charging less than the maximum rate.\nImperial College Union has backed\nImperial\u2019s decision to raise fees to \u00a39,000\narguing that it will protect bursaries.\nPresident Alex Kendall has said \u201cBy increasing the fees to \u00a39,000, those from\nlower income will have a much greater\nbursary scheme available to them.\u201d\nThe Director of Offa, Sir Martin Harris, said that while access for higher education has increased considerably over\nthe past five years, the \u201cprogress in improving access to the most selective universities has remained virtually flat\u201d. He\nwarns that under higher tuition fees that\n\u201cThere is a real risk that disadvantaged\nstudents in particular will start to feel\nthey cannot afford to go to university\u201d.\nOffa\u2019s director added that such changes\nhave an unpredictable impact on student\nbehaviour and the assessment of agreements will be amended in future years.\nUniversities have until April 2011 to submit their 2012-2013 access agreements.\nThe Office for Fair Access (Offa) has\npublished new guidelines that could\nforce universities charging over \u00a36,000\nin tuition fees to invest a percentage into\nfair access schemes.\nUniversities are advised to spend between 15% to 30%, based on the proportion of under-represented students, of any\nextra amount charged above the standard\n\u00a36,000 tuition fees on access schemes\nwhich will have to be approved by Offa\non an annual basis. The guidelines would\nsee top universities spending up to \u00a3900\nof the \u00a39,000 fee on fair access schemes.\nIn 2009/10 Imperial spent 17.5% of the\nincome from home and EU students\u2019 tuition fees on fair access schemes.\nHowever, some are skeptical about\nOffa\u2019s ability to regulate universities.\nThe body has only three full-time and\none part-time member of staff, aside\nfrom its director. NUS President Aaron\nPorter has called the body a \u201cweak and\ntoothless regulator.\u201d\nThe guidelines are not binding and\nuniversities will continue to set their\nown targets. Additionally, it will be up to\nuniversities to decide whether they have\na low proportion of under-represented\nstudents. Each year, under the \u2018access\nagreement\u2019 system universities submit\nplans to Offa detailing the measures to\nensure fair access for under-represented\nstudents, such as outreach and improvement of school and college links. However, the plans are rarely if ever rejected\nand Offa has never imposed sanctions\non a university.\nThe announcement comes after a\nmonth of confusion in the higher education sector as the government delayed\nthe publication of its plans to reform\nuniversities. It was forced to retreat after it became clear that it didn\u2019t have the\nlegal power to prevent universities from\ncharging the maximum \u00a39,000 rate of\nfees. Currently only three universities\nhave said that they plan to charge the\nmaximum \u00a39,000 rate: Cambridge, Im\u201cUniversities asked to\ninvest up to 30% of\nfees over \u00a36,000 into\nfair access schemes\u201d\n\n"

The UCU represents thousands of\nImperial staff for collective bargaining\npurposes, but according to the College, of\nthe 520 UCU members at Imperial, only\naround 290 are academics and lecturers.\nThe President of the UCU at Imperial, Dr\nMichael McGarvey, declined to confirm\nor deny these figures.

Indeed\nBolivia does remain a rather unknown\nquantity to many outside of the narcotics trade. There is a story that Queen\nVictoria once avenged her embarrassed\ndiplomat to the country, after realising\nthat it was far too inaccessible to attack,\nby simply declaring \u2018Bolivia no longer exists\u2019. Despite this snub and with\na little notoriety gained from the book\nMarching Powder this country has become a well trodden destination on the\ncontinent\u2019s Gringo trail.\nFlying in to El Alto Airport, the highest commercial airport in the world, is\na rather unique experience. Descent be-gins, and suddenly appearing through\nthe cloud below you is the mountaintop\nrunway that you feel comes out of thin\nair. And so a short drive down from the\nresting place of the mining boom\u2019s lo-comotives. It\u2019s rather strange to look\nat these dilapidated vehicles: now they\nare nothing more than scrap, but in their\nday were the sign of modern technology\npenetrating the region.\nFor the next three days we traversed\nsome of Bolivia\u2019s most breathtaking scenery, of arid rocky formations,\ndoused with sand and sprinkled with\nsparse green shrubbery. The intense sun\nand deep blue sky may have given the\nillusion of warmth, but several layers\nwere duly required to fend off the chilling temperatures. We ventured further\nsouth towards the Chilean border and\nsoon arrived at the Laguna Colorada.\nWith its waters surreally coloured red\nit was perfectly coordinated with its serene inhabitants, Andean Flamingos.\nThe next day saw us continue through\nmore Martian scenery that to me seemed\nfar more akin to the red planet than any\nHollywood depiction I\u2019d seen. This was\ninterspersed with seeing some putrid\ngeysers and a bath in a natural hot spring.\nThen there was the Laguna Verde, with\nits pigment derived from copper miner-als. Sadly I was beginning to take all of\nthese fantastic natural wonders with a\nsense of normality. Driving on we saw\nmore wildlife in the form of one of the\nllama\u2019s cousins, a group of vicu\u00f1a leisurely ascending the rocky bank parallel\nto the Landcruiser.\nWaking early on the final day was\nmagical. Leaving the cold lodgings\n(completely constructed from salt) we\nventured on from the edge towards the\nmiddle of the Salar de Uyuni, and the\nsun began to rise over the high altiplano\ncasting stark, stretching shadows across\nthe crystallised white surface. This is the\n\u201cSadly I was\nbeginning to take all\nof these fantastic\nnatural wonders with\na sense of normality\u201d\nPhotoshop eat your heart out!\nWhat were you expecting?

Step up Lake Titicaca\n\u201cBolivia does remain\na rather unknown\nquantity to many\noutside of the\nnarcotics trade\u201d\nplateau is La Paz. It is a city in a bowl,\nsurrounded by mountains, the most\nimpressive of which being the snow\ncapped Mount Illuminati.\nAs acclimatisation didn\u2019t seem to have\nhit too hard (probably soothed by the\nrecommended local tea) we decided to\npress on south to the now desolate town\nof Uyuni. This town was once the hub of\nrail transportation for the region as the\nmining industry channelled their goods\ntowards the Pacific. Its collapse left\nUyuni as a rather drab backwater, with\none convenient benefit that now attracts\n60,000 visitors every year: It is a particularly good base to start on an expedition to see the great salt flats and lagoons\nthat Bolivia should be famous for.\nThere are some generic routes that\nthese tours tend to take, and we chose\none that would take three days, but in\nreverse so that we would witness sunrise over the vast white expanse of the\nsalt flats on the final day. Before venturing into the wilderness the first stop\nwas a short drive to the town\u2019s outskirts\nto see the train \u2018graveyard\u2019, the final\nremains of a prehistoric lake, a salt des-ert, completely white with only distant\nmountains. It strips you of any sense of\ndistance or perspective, which incidentally can be used to create some rather\nnovel photographs. After another long\njourney back from Uyuni to La Paz and a\nsquashed trip onwards to Copacabana in\na local minibus, the coast of the world\u2019s\nlargest navigable lake was reached: Lake\nTiticaca. This lake was the spiritual\nhome of the once great Inca Empire, who\nbelieved that the island of the sun was\nthe birthplace of their most sacred god.\nAlthough the island is easily visible\nfrom the mainland, it took a dreadfully\nlong time to reach because the boats\nwere frustratingly slow. The island itself\nis a rather harsh rocky outcrop littered\nwith Inca ruins, sacrificial tables and\nall. It\u2019s easy to independently trek along\nthe rugged spine of the island, or take a\ndetour to follow the coast before reaching the departure port village to watch\nanother fantastic sunset. From here I\nreturned to the mainland and skirted\nacross the border into Peru.\nI think they heard you were coming....\nTravelEditor: Chris Richardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAll photos by Christopher Walmsley\n\n"

Proudly\norganized by Imperial Entrepreneurs,\nthe KCL Business Club and the UCL\nEntrepreneurs Society, the competition was a major success, attracting\nhigh-profile judges such as Margaret\nMountford (from \u2018The Apprentice\u2019),\nPier Paolo Mucelli (founder and CEO\nof eOffice) and a representative from\nOliver Wyman.\nThe competition consisted of three\nchallenges which took place over the\nweekend and were presented before the\npublic the following Monday at King\u2019s\nCollege London. The first task was designing the ideal office for the future\nand radical high-tech ideas were in no\nshortage.\nThe projects presented by the teams\nvaried widely. UCL proposed an office\nwith a highly specific conference room\nwhich was designed to stimulate the five\nsenses and included touchscreen walls\namongst other technical innovations.\nThe King\u2019s College team suggested a\nmore traditional approach with a clear\ndistinction between the administrative\nstaff and the creative department. Our\nrepresentatives focused on flexibility\nand utilitarianism, introducing the idea\nof an ever-changing office layout featuring remote controls attached to individual desks. The audience was sure to\nbe impressed by the amalgamation of\nfresh ideas, but Mr. Mucelli was quick\nat pointing out flaws in their plans. Just\nlike in the BBC Apprentice.\nThe second task tested the teams\u2019\ncommunication and bargaining skills.\nThe mission: go around London with a\npaper clip and exchange it for something\nmore valuable, a step repeated as many\ntimes as possible in order to obtain the\ngreatest profit.\nTime was just one of the many constraints added to the task, as was the rule\nthat prohibited donations. Every item or\namount of money had to be traded for\nsomething else. Team work and having a\nclear strategic approach to the task were\ncrucial in this challenge. Teams\u2019 strategies ranged from visiting individual\nhomes to travelling to touristic areas,\nwhere they could easily \u201crip off\u201d people.\nImperial chose the former and knocked\non the doors of South Kensington houses and in the end managed to eke out\nover \u00a3100 (from a paper clip!), after\nseveral remarkable feats such as trading\na pen for \u00a310.\nThe third challenge tested the teams\u2019\nmarket analysis aptitudes and their ability to come up with a feasible long term\nbusiness plan. The teams had to design\na new range of Tesco products or ser-vices. The UCL team developed a social\nbranch of the company, featuring products that would give away a percentage\nof the revenue to charity. Even though\nthis project had no start-up cost, it also\nproduced zero income, an aspect that\nwas immediately noted by Margaret.\nThe King\u2019s team put forward a network of Tesco affiliated gyms, whose\nmajor selling point was the price of the\nmembership. However, the team underestimated the costs of running a nation-al-scale gym service. Lastly, Imperial\npresented \u2018Tesco Learn\u2019, an educational\nplatform that provided basic literacy\nand numeracy training. Although it was\na noble idea, the judges were not completely sold on it.\nAfter the presentation of these three\ntasks, the judges took some time to\ndiscuss the performance of each team\nand announced the winner of each chal-lenge, followed by the presentation of\nthe overall winner. As you would all ex-pect, Imperial dominated the competition winning two out of three tasks, and\nwon the title of London Apprentice of\n2011. Zhen Lim was also awarded \u2018Best\nPerformer\u2019 for the entire competition.\nMassive congratulations to the winning\nteam. Nitin Nihalani, Sohasini Sudtharalingam, Mohammed Shaath and Lim\nZhen Xiong brought the title to Imperial\nand made their first of many appearances on the business scene.\nFor videos from the event, visit stoic\ntv\u2019s profile on YouTube, whose coverage of the event was greatly appreciated\nand central to making the event a major\nsuccess.\nMake sure to drop by the Business\nSchool on Tuesday 15th for the \u2018Ideas\nEmpowered\u2019 competition, Imperial Entrepreneurs\u2019 next big event where teams\nwill have to pitch their business ideas\nand try to convince the judges that their\nplan is worthy of the \u00a35000 prize.\nFrom left: The judges looking bored, bemused and scared, respectively\nThe Imperial College team presenting their business plan\n\u201c[The Imperial\nEntrepreneurs\u2019 team]\nmanaged to eke out\nover \u00a3100 from a\npaper clip!\u201d\n/<\u000e7<4=@;/B7=<\u000e\nB316<=:=5G\u000e\u000eA3@D713A\u000e\n1=;>/<G\u000eB6/B\u00b8A\u000e\n4C::\u000e=4\u000e\nAC@>@7A3A\u000e\nQ\u0090!\u001eY\u000eU`ORcObS\u000e^OQYOUS\nE]`Y\u000e]\\\u000eTOaQW\\ObW\\U\u000ebSQV\\]Z]Ug\u001bS\\OPZSR\u000e^`]XSQba\u000eT]`\u000e\nZSORW\\U\u000eP`O\\Ra\u001c\n0caW\\Saa\u001a\u000eBSQV\\WQOZ\u001a\u000e1]\\acZbW\\U\u000eO\\R\u000e4W\\O\\QS\u001c\n2]\\\u00b8b\u000e[Waa\u000eg]c`\u000e]^^]`bc\\Wbg\u000eb]\u000eX]W\\\u000ebVS\u000e1A1\u000e5`ORcObS\u000e\n>`]U`O[[S\u000eO\\R\u000ePSQ][S\u000eO\u000e^O`b\u000e]T\u000ebVS\u000ee]`ZR\u00b8a\u000eZO`USab\u001a\u000e\nW\\RS^S\\RS\\b\u000e7B\u000eaS`dWQSa\u000eQ][^O\\g\u001c\u000e2c`W\\U\u000e]c`\u000e \"\u001b!$\u000e[]\\bV\u000e\n^`]U`O[[S\u001a\u000eg]c\u00b8ZZ\u000ee]`Y\u000eeWbV\u000e]c`\u000eRWdS`aS\u000e`O\\US\u000e]T\u000eZSORW\\U\u000e\nQZWS\\ba\u001a\u000eeVWQV\u000eW\\QZcRS\u000e0/3\u000eAgabS[a\u001a\u000e@]gOZ\u000e;OWZ\u000eO\\R\u000ebVS\u000e\n<6A\u001c\u000eEVS`S\u000ebVOb\u000eZSORa\u000eWa\u000ec^\u000eb]\u000eg]c\u001c\n/^^ZWQObW]\\a\u000eQZ]aS\u000ea]]\\\u001a\u000ea]\u000edWaWb\u000e\neee\u001cQaQU`ORcObSa\u001cQ]\u001ccY\u000eO\\R\u000eO^^Zg\u000eb]ROg\u001c\nFELIX Friday 11 MARCH 2011\nPhotos by Alexandru Podgurschi\n\n"

    "content": "16\nCOM M ENT\nS\nomeone once told me that\ndogs can\u2019t look up. After\nthe serendipitous, albeit not\nentirely legal acquisition of\nseveral dogs and the systematic placing of bones, dog food, and\neven cats on formidably high shelving, I\nat last determined that this was utter bol-locks. But it got me thinking. Dogs can\nlook up, but can people?\nWell, of course, they can \u2013 the mechanical basis is there. I\u2019ve spent many\nan hour manhandling anatomy skeletons\ninto a variety of ungodly shapes and\nlooking up is but one permutation. But\nout on the streets, it\u2019s hard to find any in\nvivo confirmation.\nIn fact, on the underground, it\u2019s practically unheard of. Commuters have gone\nseveral stops past their destination to\nsave the public humiliation of having\nto look up as the station names, emblazoned upon the platform walls, flash by.\nI think it might a defence mechanism,\na throw\u2013back to that stage of evolution\nwhen the human race was particular vulnerable to having its throat ripped out.\nIn looking up, we expose a very fleshy,\nvery vital piece of anatomy, practically\nwelcoming a good garrotting.\nSo resisting the urge to look up is a\nsurvival strategy, part of the \u201chead down\nand carry on\u201d mentality of the collec-tive. Still, I think it\u2019s sad that a young\nwoman under attack is more likely to receive help from passers\u2013by if she shouts\n\u201cfire!\u201d than if she cries \u201crape!\u201d It may\nhave started as a means of survival, but\nkeeping our heads down nowadays is\nbeginning to work against us.\nThis is such a shame because I think\npeople are missing out on something\nincredible, something you can only see\nwhen you look up. To make sure you get\na really good gander at it, you need to\ngo somewhere high, or open. Preferably\nboth.\nI can vouch for the top of the Queen\u2019s\nTower and Hampstead Heath, they\u2019ll\nboth do. Go up on a really clear day and\nyou can see it. What are you looking for,\nyou ask? Nothing.\nI find there\u2019s nothing better than looking up at bright azure sky and seeing\nabsolutely nothing, save for the faintest\nwhispers of cloud.\nFor me, there is nothing more inspirational than a big fat nothing. Firstly,\nthere are no boundaries, no limits, on a\nblue summer\u2019s sky. If the sky can\u2019t be\nfenced, why should I be? Break out, live\ndangerously, do something that scares\npeople! Those people who say the sky is\nthe limit just aren\u2019t thinking big enough.\nSecondly, it is the ultimate blank canvas.\nYou could do anything on a clear sky,\nfrom playing about with sky\u2013writing\nand making shapes out of the clouds to\ncircumnavigating the world in a hot-air\nballoon...and a moustache. There\u2019s so\nmuch potential, it actually makes me\ntingle.\nAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in this.\nThroughout the long, long annals of history there has not been a single person to\nUp is the new down\ndraw inspiration from their shoes (with\nthe possible exception of Doc Marten).\nNewton was gazing up at the moon in\nhis orchard when gravity struck. In\nschool, Einstein day-dreamed that he\nwas riding a star-beam.\nIt is important to look up, and not just\nto be inspired. Sometimes, it is important to look up, just to feel good.\nI mean, how can we ever hope to be\nup\u2013lifted if we don\u2019t know what things\nlook like in that direction? Never underestimate the untold beauty that hangs\nabove you. Unless it\u2019s raining.\nIt\u2019s easy to keep your head down and get lost in your own\nworld. Maybe we should all get a new perspective\nWhen the Union President Alex Kendall said\nthat using the amenities fund to subsidise\nalcohol was immoral, there was an eruption\nof anger. Postgraduate students rose to the\ndefense of the amenities fund, and Kendall\nclaimed that he was merely encouraging de-bate. The discussions about hall rents have\nalmost entirely focused on this subject, but\nbeneath the furore another, perhaps more\ncontentious, question is being asked by the\nsurvey: Should Imperial continue to offer\nfree gym and swim facilities at Ethos?\nImperial is possible the only university in\nthe UK that guarantees free gym access\nto all of its students. Although services\nlike exercise classes or squash courts are\ncharged, the state-of-the-art gym and pool\nfacilities are not. Few students would ever\nbe heard complaining about the quality of\nthe facilities, and it is fair to say that the\nfree access is a luxury.\nIn the context of the ongoing debate about\nreducing hall rents, one must ask whether\nit is worth keeping this luxury. Is it right that\nprofit from hall rents should go to provide\nfree gym access for all?\nThere are some very convincing arguments for saying No. Not all students who\nlive in halls use the gym regularly and it\u2019s\nlikely that many of them will use the gym\nonly once or twice throughout their time at\nImperial. Additionally, free gym membership creates problems in terms of usage;\nzero cost should logically lead to infinite\ndemand. At certain times of the week, it\nseems as though this rule is adhered to lit-erally. This crowding forces students to use\nthe gym at unsociable hours or pay for private gym membership elsewhere. Raising\nthe cost would dampen demand and therefore the congestion. Already we\u2019ve seen\nmeasures put in place to address the issue\nof overcrowding. Members of staff (who pay\nfor Ethos) now have allocated gym time on\nTuesdays and Thursdays.\nOf course, these arguments can be countered with just as much strength. Staff\nmembers earn salaries and are therefore\nable to pay. There is no need to introduce\n\u2018economics\u2019 into gym overcrowding because it\u2019s already there; students who don\u2019t\nlike using the gym when it\u2019s busy can go at\ndifferent times or use a private gym (why\npenalise those who don\u2019t mind?) Do 1st\nyears in Halls really subsidise Ethos? Well\nonly if they all dropped out; a 3rd year using\nthe gym \u2018for free\u2019 paid for it when he or she\nwas in halls in their 1st year.\nThis is clearly only a taster of the discussions being had on the issue. But most\nimportantly, we mustn\u2019t forget the value of\nfree Ethos gym membership as a symbol. It\nis a luxury, no doubt, but we all feel some\npride in being able to say that our university\noffers its students free gym membership.\nIt\u2019s a feather in our collective cap \u2013 and that\nhas real value.\nFELIX\nRhys Davies\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nShould Ethos be free?\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\n--g\nt\n\u201d\nIf the sky can\u2019t be fenced, why\nshould I be?

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX 3\nFriday 11 MARCH 2011\nStrike over changes to pensions\nsays that the expectation is that UCU\nmembers will strike, he said that they do\nnot \u201cdictate\u201d to members and that it will\nbe up to individuals to decide whether\nto participate in the strike. Imperial College UCU members were balloted on\nWednesday the 3rd of March about strike\naction: 84 of the 132 that returned ballots\nvoted in favour of the strike.\nAlthough preparations are being made\nfor the strike action, the UCU has yet to\ngive formal notice, which legally must\nbe given at least seven days in advance\nof any action. An Imperial College\nspokesman said that once notice has\nbeen given, they will \u201cask any staff intending to participate in industrial action\nto declare this.\u201d Following this they will\nassess the possible disruption to teaching\nand \u201ctake steps to minimise the impact\u201d\nPostgraduates such as taught masters\nstudents are thought to be less vulnerable to possible strike action, since there\nis more flexibility in rescheduling their\nclasses. However, the Divisional Administrator for Biology and Cell and\nMolecular Biology, Pat Evans, said\nthat rescheduling undergraduate classes\nwould be \u201cmore tricky.\u201d\nDr McGarvey said that any disruption\nto students\u2019 courses would be \u201cunfortunate\u201d. He argued that it was not the\nunion\u2019s intention to negatively affect\ntheir studies and claimed that the strike\nwas necessary to protect university education in the long-term.\nUCU General Secretary Sally Hunt\nhas called on employers to return to the\nnegotiating table but the Employers\u2019Pension Forum (EPF), who are representing\nuniversities in the dispute, have rejected\ncalls for further talks, saying \u201cwe are not\npersuaded that it is appropriate to re-open\nformal negotiations\u201d. Sally Hunt accused\nthe EPF of engaging in \u201ca macho standoff\u201d and said that although striking was\na \u201clast resort\u201d, UCU members \u201cfeel they\nhave been left with no [other] choice\u201d.\nCriticising the UCU\u2019s decision to\nstrike, Brian Cantor, chair of the EPF,\nsaid: \u201cWe do not believe that industrial\naction is an appropriate step for UCU to\ntake. We do not agree that students and\ntheir parents will share your view that\nthere is \u2018no choice\u2019 but to strike.\u201d\nThe dispute originated in late 2008,\nwhen the Universities Superannuation\nScheme (USS), the central pension fund\nwhich covers the majority of university\npensions, set up a committee to review\nthe pension arrangements of its mem-bers. A consultation period on the proposals ran from October to December\nlast year and the final proposals, including changes following the consultation,\nare due to be implemented on the 1st\nof April. The changes, which amongst\nother things would see employees making increased contributions to their pen-sions, were called \u201cthe most radical\u201d\nin the history of the scheme by a USS\nspokesman. At present, employees must\nannually pay 6.25% of their total salary into the fund, whilst employers pay\n16%. Under the new proposals, employees would see their contributions\nincrease to 7.5%.\nOther changes include raising the pension age to 65 and introducing a cap on\ninflationary increases to pension payments at 5%. Following the consultation period, during which concerns were\nraised about this proposal, the cap has\nbeen raised to 10%. Additionally, new\nmembers joining the scheme would be\nhave a career-average pension rather\nthan a final-salary pension, which would\nleave them significantly worse off.\nPerhaps one of the most contentious\nproposals would see staff who are made\nredundant after the 31st of March 2013\nreceive a reduced pension. The proposals would leave it up to universities to\ndecide whether or not to offer a full pension as part of a redundancy package.\nEmployers say that the current pension arrangement is unsustainable in the\nlong term. They argue that people are\nliving longer (therefore drawing their\npensions for longer) and that salaries\nhave risen faster than previously antici-pated. Therefore, they say, the scheme is\nin \u201cdanger of becoming unaffordable\u201d.\nThe changes are aimed at reducing\nemployers\u2019 long-term liabilities. The\nconsultation document readily admits\nthat \u201cthe scheme is not in crisis\u201d and the\nUSS\u2019s annual report for 09/10 shows an\n\u00a38.5 million positive return after pensions have been paid. Dr Michael McGarvey said that the Union do not wish\nto jeopardise the scheme, but argued that\nthe proposals \u201care more extreme than\nare required.\u201d A USS spokesman told\nFelix that the dispute has arisen, partly,\nbecause employers want to mitigate future risk now, while the UCU is reluctant to increase the burden on employees\nbased on predicted trends.\nRethink on visas\nleaving them with no opportunity to acquire valuable work experience.\n\u201cThere may be ways we can tighten it\nup and make sure it is not abused by becoming a route to settlement. There are\na whole range of options between complete closure of the route and the status quo and we are discussing with the\nHome Office what these options might\nbe,\u201d said Willetts.\nThe post-study work route currently\nenhances the UK\u2019s overall offer to international students and universities have\nexpressed concern that scrapping the\nscheme will make them less competitive\nwith other countries in attracting stu-dents. Dr Wendy Piatt, director general\nof the Russell Group of universities, said\nthat, \u201cIf we do not offer international UK\nuniversity graduates the opportunity to\nwork for a short period in highly skilled\njobs, some of the world\u2019s brightest students will choose to study elsewhere.\u201d\nAfter Damian Green argued that\nthe student visa system was subject to\n\u201cwidespread abuse\u201d and said that the\ngovernment would limit the number\nof dependants entering the UK with\nstudents, David Willetts now indicates\nthat these proposals are also still under\nconsideration. He questions \u201cto what\nextent does people\u2019s ability to bring in\ndependants affect their own willingness\nto come to study?\u201d\nUniversity vice-chancellors have\nalso argued that a visa reduction would\nhave devastating consequences for the\nfunding of higher education in the UK,\neven forcing the typically more expensive science and engineering courses\nto close. Data from the government\u2019s\nHigher Education Funding Council for\nEngland also indicates that universities\nare increasingly reliant on fees from\nforeign students to boost their finances.\nImperial is a notorious example, charging international fees of up to \u00a326,250\nwhilst fees for British and EU students\nare capped at \u00a33,290 this academic year\n(rising to \u00a39000 from 2012). Despite\nthe 3934 students from outside the EU\nmaking up less than half of the student\npopulation enrolled in 2009, their fees\ngenerate twice as much income: \u00a375.1m\nto be precise, compared with the \u00a331.3m\nfrom the 9539 UK/EU students.\nThe proposals to reduce the number of\nstudent visas form part of a major coalition pledge to reduce net migration from\n\u201chundreds of thousands to tens of thousands\u201d by 2015. With two-thirds of non-EU migrants entering the UK on student\nvisas, tightening this system is a crucial\npart of the strategy.\n\u201cThis government want to ensure that\nthe primary reason for those who enter\non a student visa is genuinely to come\nhere to study. We are working closely\nwith the Department for Business and\nwill make an announcement in due\ncourse,\u201d a spokesperson for the Home\nOffice said.\nUniversity and Colleges Union general secretary, Sally Hunt has recognised\nthe reconsiderations as \u201cencouraging\u201d\nbut claims that \u201cwe have a long way to\ngo before anything this government is\ndoing to higher education could be considered welcomed.\u201d\nImperialCollegeBusinessSchool graduates\nmake a difference.

Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology found that volunteers\nwere happy to be touched by a robot nurse, if under the impression they were cleaning a wound. If\ntold the robot was there to provide comfort, participants were less than positive about the experience.\nStrangely enough, people have a similar reaction\nto human nurses \u2013 obviously they\u2019ve just met the\nwrong sort of nurse.\nCharlie Harvey\nWant to win \u00a3100,000 and catch a dangerous dis-ease? Well, a proposed \u201cnew reality TV show\u201d advertised just that in its search for contestants. Asking\nfor individuals who were \u201cNot worried about looking and feeling your worst on live TV?\u201d the show,\nQuarantine, was to be set in a virology lab with the\ncontestants exposed to infectious diseases. The\nlast contestant remaining in the room would win the\nmoney. Published in the Daily Mirror, the advert received over 200 applications. Medical professionals\nkicked up a fuss condemning the show. However, it\nwas later revealed to be an experiment by the Mirror\nto see \u201cjust how far people will go in the pursuit of\nfame\u201d.\nBen Good\nThere\u2019s no need to fear robots\nKadhim Shubber\nThe Polish restaurant on Exhibition Road, Ognisko, seems to be out of its time. The d\u00e9cor\nand atmosphere would seem to suggest that\nmink-ensconced flappers and mustachioed airmen could come swooping into the dining hall\nat any moment. It\u2019s in these surroundings that\nI have the pleasure to sit beside Emeritus Professor Igor Alexander, who has just spent the\nprevious hour or so talking about how the inter-connectedness of neural networks in the brain\ncould be the cause of consciousness itself. I ask\nhim if his understanding of the brain has altered\nhis experience of the world and his awareness\nof his own consciousness. He gives a short sincere laugh and replies that it\u2019s made him feel\nmuch more comfortable about the whole thing.\nDuring his lecture, entitled: \u201cCan mankind\nsurvive in the age of information?\u201d and hosted\nby Friends of Imperial, he displayed a similar\nair of ease and confidence. He readily admits\nat the beginning that the title is a tad mislead-ing. It\u2019s too easy a question, he suggests, and\nit can be answered \u201cin three seconds flat.\u201d The\nanswer is obviously Yes, he says. Sitting at the\nfront of the lecture theatre, I can almost feel the\nquizzical looks of the audience behind me de-manding: \u201cthen what is this lecture about?\u201d\nAsking whether mankind can survive in the\n21st century, in this age of information, implies\nthat there is something to fear. The point of\nProfessor Alexander\u2019s lecture \u2013 starting with\nknocking down the title at the beginning \u2013 is to\nshow that those who gloomily predict the rise\nof computers (and the fall of mankind that usually accompanies their narrative) or the damaging effect of the Internet on our brains, are\nmisunderstanding something crucial about our\nbrains and consciousness.\nAs a man who has devoted his entire career to\nunderstanding the mind, Professor Alexander is\nmore than qualified to make such a statement.\nHe is an electrical engineer who designed and\nbuilt the world\u2019s first neural pattern recognition\nsystem and he has published over 200 scienftif-ic papers and 12 books about the mind. Why\nshouldn\u2019t an electrical engineer pioneer research into the brain? is the challenge he raises\nwhen he says: \u201cThe brain is a physical, chemical and electrical device\u201d, therefore it can be\nanalysed using the tools of physicists, chemists\nand electrical engineers.\nSo what did people like Ed Fredkin, who\nin 1983 suggested on the BBC\u2019s Horizon that\nwithin eight years computers would have\ngrown so powerful that they would keep humans as pets, get wrong about consciousness?\nProfessor Alexander first explained what might\nconjure up consciousness. Neurons behave like\nthe components of a circuit, in that they perform the same sort of logical operations. However, they don\u2019t have the same linear relationship between input and output. They\u2019re looped\nand networked in such a way that they pass\nsignals between each other and, in his words,\n\u201creverberate\u201d. This internal reverberation,\nwhich may not result in any output, could be\nthe source of thought. The more interconnected\na network, the greater the ability for conscious\nthought \u2013 this is where I began to shudder at\nthe thought of someone reducing the intercon-nectedness of my neurons and wiping away my\nconsciousness in the process, silly I know.\nThe crucial point, however, is that this is not\nenough for consiciousness. These reverberations\nmust have some correlation with the outside\nworld. In short, you must be able to interpret and\nrecognise the world around you. The neurons\nalso form imprints and patterns of reverberations\nthat can be triggered and fired off without external input \u2013 this is where memory and our ability\nto interpret and recognise could reside.\nComing back to robots, to the fear of the\nrise of the machines, a being\u2019s consciousness\nis dependent on its needs and its experience of\nthe world. A packaging robot\u2019s consciousness\nis grounded solely in its experience of being a\npackaging robot. Similarly its needs are simple;\nif it\u2019s constantly plugged in, why would it revolt against mankind?\nThe problem with his argument, I guess, is\nthat one can always have nightmares about a\nspecific robot in a highly specific set of circumstances that would crush all of mankind.\nProfessor Alexander obviously doesn\u2019t worry\nabout such things (who seriously does?) but\nthe lecture still left me unsettled. Although he\nclaimed to be more at ease with his consicious-ness through understanding where it might\narise, I became more worried about the fragility\nof my identity. Each moment of our existence is\nunique and definable, he says (well thank good-ness!) but as you reduce the interconnectedness\nof a neural system, your capacity to distinguish\nbetween them, and thus your ability to interact\nwith the world diminishes.\nOh dear. I\u2019d better lay off the wine then!\nFriends of Imperial\u2019s next lecture will be by\nProfessor Frank Berkshire on the 17th of\nMarch, in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building from 19:00. It is entitled \u201cChaotic cards\nand dynamic dice\u201d and looks at how mathematics can be used for gain in gambling.\nAnum Niaz\nProtein possible anti-leukaemia agent\nA protein, CD19-ligand, demonstrates a promising cure for one of the most common forms\nof childhood cancer: Acute Lymphoblastic\nLeukaemia (ALL).\nThe ALL cells are recognized as mutagens,\nwhich leads to an immune response and the\ngeneration of antibodies against the cancer.\nResearchers, Fatih M. Uckun and Hong Ma,\nalongside others, began working with a series of basic procedures which finally led to\nthe cloning of part of the DNA which directly\ncodes for part of the CD19 receptor. This part\nof DNA was then compared with the predetermined gene sequences within the GeneBank\nDatabase. The resulting DNA sequence was\nfurther developed to form a specific secondary\nstructure.\nThe researchers discovered that CD19 receptor molecules regulate B-lymphocytes released during an immune response against the\nprimary leukaemia cells. By interacting with\nits co-receptor molecules, CD19 allows the\nsmooth \u2018development, proliferation, activation\nand differentiation\u2019 of B-lymphocytes. However, the interaction between CD19-ligands and\nleukaemia results in cell death which assists\nin the regulation of immune responses and the\nprevention of autoimmunity. In CD19+ leukaemia cells this interaction results in an altered\nset of signals being sent which cause cell death.\nHence, the structure and bonding of the ligand\nwith its co-receptor determines the fate of the\ncell.\nCD19-L was then tested as a down-regulator\nof leukaemic activity in ALL cells with CD19\npositive co-receptors. At this stage the interaction between CD19 co-receptors and CD19-L\naltered the regulation of genes; the down-reg-ulated genes were analysed in greater detail,\nand lead the researchers to the conclusion that\nCD19-L had a significant effect on cell signal-ling, causing cell death and gene expression.\nThe experiment is furthered by the treatment\nof chemotherapy resistant ALL CD19 positive\ncells with CD19-L concluding that CD19-L also\ncauses cell death in relapsedALLcells (CD19+).\nThe importance of determining CD19-L\nbinding and functionality lies in the recovery of\npatients with relapsed ALL. As lead researcher\nFatih Uckun says \u201cThese are the cells that are\nthe most difficult to treat. The challenge is to\nkill these cells while leaving healthy cells intact.\u201d The major advantage of CD19 is its specific and ample expression on leukaemic cells.\nCD19-Ligands are potential agents for the\ntransport of cytotoxic materials to leukaemic\ncells, and may be a more effective and less\ndamaging solution to an on-going problem.\nWilling to look like this for a hundred grand?\nCharlie Sheen ain\u2019t looking good...\nMy prayers have been answered...\nFELIX\nFriday 11 MARCH 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 25\nFriday 11 march 2011\nopportunity for change at the House of\nDior, and evolution of a brand is unavoidable and ought to be celebrated.\nGalliano will still be sorely missed\nas one of the fashion industry\u2019s real\nheavy-hitters. With few other designers considered his equal in terms of\ntalent and influence, (Karl Lagerfeld,\nJean Paul Gaultier and Giorgio Armani\narguably make up the rest of fashion\u2019s\n\u2018old guard\u2019) his absence will be felt\nacutely; many have been sympathetic\nto his demise. Says Suzy Menkes of\nthe International Herald Tribune: \u201cThe\npressure from fast fashion and from\nthe instant Internet age to create\nnew things constantly has worn\ndown other famous names. Marc\nJacobs, design director of Louis\nVuitton, ended a wild streak in\nrehab. Calvin Klein famously\nrambled across a sports\npitch and admitted to substance abuse. And the late\nYves Saint Laurent spent\na lifetime fighting his demons.\u201d Hilary Alexander\nof the Daily Telegraph\nwas shocked at his behaviour but added, \u201cI am\nnot for a moment excusing his behaviour. There\nwill come a time when he\nmust confront the viper in\nhis breast. But right now,\nthis is a moment in his life\nwhen he needs support and\nlove from the industry he\nhas given his life to.\u201d\nHis swansong, how-ever, was disappointing.\nWith only a few comprehensive looks that\nreally paid tribute to\nGalliano\u2019s talent and\nmastery at Dior, his\nfinal collection left\nsomething to be de-sired. Tim Blanks\nat style.com commented that perhaps a ready-to-wear\ncollection was not a proper farewell\nfor Galliano, \u201cit was a pale testament\nto the extraordinary work the ateliers\nhave done for Galliano over the past\n14 years. The proper tribute would ideally have been one of the Dior couture\nshows, where the extravagant drama of\nthe designer\u2019s soaring imagination was\nevenly matched by breathtaking workmanship.\u201d\nThere is no doubt that John Galliano\u2019s\nbehaviour was unacceptable and that\nhe is in need of help and rehabilitation\nfor his problems with alcohol. Previous disgraces in the fashion industry,\nespecially amongst its most brightly\nshining stars, have not been uncom-mon. Pictures released in 2005 of Kate\nMoss snorting cocaine led to her being\ndropped from numerous advertising\ncampaigns; Galliano is now employing\nGerald Tyrrell, the lawyer whose help\nMoss enlisted at the time. Tim Blanks\nremarked, \u201cThe only precedent for this\nsituation is Coco Chanel\u2019s post-war\ndenunciation as a Nazi collaboratrice.\nHer exile from the fashion world lasted\nnine years.\u201d\nA\nfter allegations of antisemitic and racial slurs\nagainst a couple in a\nParisian caf\u00e9, and the release of a damning video\nevidencing yet more abusive behaviour,\nJohn Galliano was dismissed from his\nrole as designer for Christian Dior last\nThursday. Although the fashion world\nhas been rocked by the shocking events\nleading to his dismissal, fashion month,\nnow at its tail-end, continued unhin-dered, and Galliano\u2019s final show at Dior\nwent ahead on Sunday. Dior CEO Sidney Toledano prefaced the show with a\nspeech about the values that Christian\nDior has represented, asserting that\nthey would be preserved by \u201cthe heart\nof the House of Dior, which beats unseen\u2026 made up of its teams and studios,\nof its seamstresses and craftsmen\u201d. It is\nrumoured that these petites mains bore\nmost of the brunt of this final collection\nwhilst John Galliano was battling his\nproblems with alcoholism.\nFollowing Galliano\u2019s ignominious\nfall, rumours have become rife as to\nwho will be his successor. Amongst the\ncontenders are: Stefano Pilati, designer\nat Yves Saint Laurent; Alber Elbaz, the\ncelebrated designer behind Lanvin; Olivier Theyksens, who has previously\ndesigned for Rochas and Nina Ricci;\nand Haider Ackermann, whose most\nrecent own-label collections have been\nreceived to much critical acclaim. The\nfrontrunner, however, appears to be\nRiccardo Tisci, designer at Givenchy\n\u2013 the label which John Galliano spent\ntwo years designing for before moving\nto Christian Dior. Tisci will be familiar\nwith the large number of collections expected at the great and historic design\nhouse, which turns 64 this year. Christian Dior sends out two ready-to-wear\ncollections as well as two couture col-lections; most design houses no longer\ncreate the expensive couture collections\nthat arguably maintain the essence of\nthe particular design house\u2019s aesthetic.\nHowever, amongst the most traditional\nbrands that still produce couture, which\ninclude Valentino and Chanel, Givenchy\nremains one of them, which places Tisci\nat huge advantage.\nSome commentators seem concerned\nby this potential choice, however:\nWWD claims that Tisci\u2019s aesthetic is\n\u201cperhaps too dark and brooding for the\nglobal behemoth that is Dior.\u201d His previous collections for Givenchy (far right)\nhave drawn comments about his gothic\nfascinations, he himself cited Frida\nKahlo as an inspiration for his Fall 2010\ncouture collection which contained re-Tisci to replace disgraced Galliano?\nAs rumours of Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci as successor to the Dior throne\ngrow, the industry reminisces about Galliano\u2019s legacy: Saskia Verhagen reports\nJohn Galliano at the end of his final couture collection (below) for Dior\nligious, anatomical\nand deathly imagery.\nDior, on the other\nhand, will require\nsome modulation of\nthe designer\u2019s inclinations towards the\ndark and brooding\naesthetic that he\nhas developed\nat Givenchy;\nDior is a house\nfamed for\ntraditional elegance and sublime femininity.\nDespite this, there are\nfew doubts about Tisci\u2019s\nlevel of craftsman-ship. Famed for his\nnotoriously painstaking attention to detail,\nthe \u201cultimate in arti-sanship and femininity\u201d, which Toledo\npaid tribute to in his\nspeech, will certainly be maintained.\nWhomever they choose,\nhowever, this is an exciting\n\u201cWith few other\ndesigners considered\nhis equal, his absence\nwill be felt acutely;\nmany have been\nsympathetic to his\ndemise\u201d\nFASHION\nFashion Editor: Saskia Verhagen\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Ask for a\nstudent discount and bring your\nImperial ID.\nCash only.\nP\nride is a funny sort of thing.\nIt tends to only come out on\nspecial occasions: times like\nwhen you realise the person\nyou are overhearing on the\ntube went to a university that is rated 3rd\nfrom the bottom rather than 3rd from the\ntop of the league tables and you sit there\nthinking that you\u2019re pleased that you\ngo to Imperial. I think part of our pride\ncomes from the fact that Imperial offers\nsomewhat \u2018classical\u2019 subjects, showing\na reverence for the timeless and historically robust. In particular, those things\nthat make sense to us but the rest of the\nworld think are slightly bizarre, such as\nthe fact that we have Varsity against ourselves and that we have a Mountain Hut\nin the midst of Wales. We are one of\nthree universities (guess the other two)\nwith an Exploration Board that encourages students to get off campus and explore the world, and we are one of two\ntaking care of Vintage Vehicles.\nThe students of Imperial College London are collectively the owners of four\nvintage vehicles that are as much a repository of the College history as the\nArchive Office itself. Each vehicle was\nbestowed, bought or assimilated to become part of the biggest university fleet\nin the country, which is now envied by\nour competitors. They are Clementine\n(II) Morris, Jezebel Dennis, Derrick\nand Boanerges \u2013 oh yes, our fleet have\nnames.\nIt seems pleasingly appropriate that\nImperial would have these attributes as a\nunique selling point, having been a leader in engineering since the genesis of\nmotorised transport. Who doesn\u2019t crack\ninto a smile or point them out when a\nvintage vehicle chugs down the road? To\nthis end, when they do get out and about,\nthey serve as some of the very best ambassadors for the college and its students\nin humility, respect and technical ability.\nOur youngest addition is lovingly\nknown as Clem. She is a Morris T-type\n(I\u2019m sure that means something to some\npeople) one tonne truck born on 13th\nOctober 1926. Having changed hands a\ncouple of times, she was adopted by the\nstudents of the Royal School of Mines\nto become their replacement vehicular\nmascot in 1960. Despite being a truck,\nshe is very much in touch with the modern stereotypical Imperial girl, being\nunderstated in looks but a rewarding\nlover if you give her the attention she\ndeserves. In days gone by, she boldly\nsported the RSM colours with a yellow\ncab, black bonnet and wings, and a red\nchassis. Her biggest claim to fame is a\ntotal resurrection in 1987, having been\nput aside in boxes with the intention of\nan overhaul 11 years before. Despite\nthis medical marvel, she runs like a\ncharm and continues to pass her MOT.\nJezebel Dennis is perhaps the celebrity\nof the fleet in a sort of Jordan-glamourmodel way. She\u2019s got large assets in the\nform of her working pump, as she is an\noriginal 1916 Dennis N-Type fire engine that was used by the London Fire\nBrigade up until her retirement in 1932.\nShe then had a fling with another owner\nbefore settling down to become the\nRCSU mascot in 1955 on the grounds\nthat the RCSU of the time \u201cwere looking for a suitable means of transport for\ntheir President.\u201d However, like Jordan\nand being a bit cheeky, 2 years later she\nmanaged to ruin the Queen Mother\u2019s\ncoat with her new red paint job. Since\nthe early days, she\u2019s become the more\ndemure Katie Price and an excellent advocate for the college by representing us\nat events like the Lord Mayors Show and\nthe New Year celebrations until in 2009\nwhen she had a run in with a Routemaster bus\u2026 literally. What you would only\nfind out in her autobiography (Jez\u2019s not\nKatie\u2019s) is that she is the owner of her\nown Blue Peter Badge, which she got\nfor appearing on the show in 1982, and\nstarred in Michael Winner\u2019s \u201cThe Jokers\u201d; a film released in 1966.\nBoanerges (translated as \u2018Sons of\nThunder\u2019) is the older gentleman of the\nfleet and a true gentleman\u2019s sort of ve-hicle. Abbreviated to Bo\u2019, he is the mascot of CGCU and was bought in 1934\nfor a handsome \u00a340 though the car was\nborn in 1902: a James & Browne with\na 9 horse power engine. In 1953, in the\n50th publication of Felix, he underwent\na challenge that can only be thought to\nbe the idea for the modern day TV show,\nTop Gear, in which he boasted a 35ft diameter turning circle. Despite having a\nmaximum speed of 28mph, he was pursued for speeding in 1956 by the police.\nCharges were dropped after the famous\nBritish satirical magazine, Punch, published a cartoon of the episode on their\nfront cover that week. Bo has a younger\nbrother, Derrick, which is a 1926 Ner-acar motor cycle. Together, the vehicles\nundergo a strange gender transition to\nbecome a homage to Bo Derek (yes, a\nchange in spelling), a popular Hollywood actress of the 80\u2019s.\nIn many ways these vehicles are the\nperfect hobby for the budding engineer\nor DIY enthusiast. The other rare opportunity for a university student here is\nthat you get to be a caretaker of something that has been passed down to us\nfrom our own alumni with the hope of\ncarrying on what was started long before\nour transient experience of the college,\nand continuing that source and tradition\nof pride. You don\u2019t even have to be an\nengineer, as it\u2019s a great learning environment for anyone who wants to appreciate vintage in one of its most lasting\nforms. Failing that, the uniforms that accompany the cars could perhaps do with\na visit from a sewing machine if that is\nmore your style. If you\u2019ve been charmed\ninto getting involved or lured by a false\npromise of meeting Katie Price, please\nemail jez@imperial.ac.uk \u2013 the clubs\nwould be happy to show you the ropes.\nA homage to the fleet of vintage\nvehicles that belong to all of us.\nBy Jenny Wilson\n\u201cShe\u2019s in touch with\nthe modern stereotyped Imperial girl;\nunderstated in looks\nbut a rewarding lover\u201d\nFrom left: Jezebel Dennis, Derrick, Boanerges and Clementine (II) Morris\nGetting to lectures in the morning used to be so much more fun...\nThese be some \u2018fly\u2019 chaps...
