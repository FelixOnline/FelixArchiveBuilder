Here is the\nreply.\nM.P.'s REPLY Dear Rupert Harper,\nVery many thanks for\nyour letter of the 16th January about the present grants available to\nstudents. I am asking\nthe Secretary of State to\nlet me have her comments on the points you\nhave made.\nI must stress very\nstrongly that I believe\nwe must get away from\nsuch things as rent\nstrikes, in order to\nachieve our objectives.\nIt is to my mind as y mp ton of a very unhappy\nsociety that we should\neven have to conte m plate these and not try\nand settle our problems\non a more sophisticated\nand reasonable basis.\nSincerely,\nRichard Luce, M.P. I have received a reply\nfrom Mr, Fail-brother, ASTMS\nsecretary (see first FELIX\nthis term). It was late, how-ever, due to it having been\nposted in the wrong box. It\nwit be printed in full in the\nnest issue.\nThe reason that there are adverts scattered about\nin this issue is that they are not being presented in\ntime. I MUST have adverts, and articles by the\nMonday, one week and a day before Felix is due,\ni.e. Monday, 12th February for next issue. It is, of course, possible to print\narticles referring to matters that happen between then and the weekend, e.g. sports. (NB\u2014Bob Barley is Sports Editor).\nONE person has complained that F elx is now unreadable due to its lack of\npolities. SEVERAL have said that Felix is better than it has been for some\ntime, mainly due to the range of articles and lack of ultra-left wing politics.\nI agree with the latter.

What does one\ndo?\nTRIBUNAL\nMany people will tell\nyou there is a simple\nanswer \u2014 go to your\nlocal Rent Tribunal.\nThey wii ll usually accept\nyour case, cancel the\n\"notice to quit\", and in\na few weeks' time inform\nyou of a hearing date at\nwhich you and your landlord will get together\nwith the Panel of the Tribunal, who Willi fix the\nrent of your ac com moda tion, and give you a security of tenure for, normally six months in the\nfirst instance. The rent\nthen becomes registered\nat your local Town Hall\nand the landlord cannot\nnormally raise it for\nthree years; and if after\nyour first period of security expires, your landlord servers you with\nfurther \"notice to quit\"\nyou may apply to the Tribunal for a further period\nof security, although this\nis less often given.\nHowever, things don't often work out so easily.\nThe Rent Tribunal may\nnot accept your case.\nThe landlord may apply\nto the County Court for\nan eviction order.

    "content": "ff age6 FELIX5 th February, 1974\nALQU1N\nMOUNTAIN QUEEN\nHolland always seems to come up\nwith bands importing themselves to\nBritain and trying to make a name\nhere. Some succeeded: some didn't. Focus and Golden Earring are two examples that have. Earth & Fire and\nSandy Coast are two that are still\nworking at it.\nThe latest to try are Alquin. Their\nfirst album, Marks', was released in\nMarch 1973. Their latest, 'MOUN-TAIN QUEEN' is due February 1974.\nThe background, especially of the\nearlier members of the band, is a mixture of jazz and Rn B. With a lineup of saxophones, flute, organ, guitar,\nbass and drums they have managed\nto produce a style that appears to be\nFocus, Chicago and If mixed to get h CURTIS MAYF1ELD\nCURTIS IN CHICAGO\nSuperfly, as a film, was a successful box-office hit. It also provided\nriches for Curton Records, owned by\nCurtis Mayfield who sang the title\ntrack. In 1973 Curtis, along with his\noriginal group, the Impressions, made\na TV show for America. From this\nshow, along with one or two earlier\ntrap ks with dubbed clapping, an\nalbum 'CURTIS IN CHICAGO' was\nproduced.\n, As mentioned, Curtis rejoins the\nImpressions both old and new. Also\nJIMI HENDRIX\nLOOSE ENDS\nHendrix is long dead now and yet\nstill previously unreleased tapes\nappear. The latest offering from Polydor is entitled 'LOOSE ENDS' and\n\u2022consists of a collection of recordings\nincluding studio back-chat. The main\nline up consists of Jimi with Mitch\nMitchell and Billy Cox with assistance on some tracks from Noel Redding and Buddy Miles.\nOn listening, and without any\ner. An interesting combination and\none which comes over quite well. The\nguitar playing of Ferdinand Bakker is\nably supported by Dick Franssen on\norgan with Job Tarenskeen and Ronald Ottenhoff providing the brass sec-tion. Hein Mars, bass, and Paul\nWestrake, drums, complete the line-up. Vocals are provided by Job and\nFerdinand.\nThe jazz influences are especially\nnoticeable in the brass sections whilst\nFerdinand also shows that he is by no\nmeans a bad violin player. A very\neasy going album and one that I have\npersonally found eminently suitable\nfor listening to in the late evening.\nOverall an excellent album and one\nwhich should do well for them. Hopefully, more will be heard from them\nthough I hope that their build up is\nbetter planned than Focus' and that\nthey are allowed to develop rather\nthan having stardom forced upon\nthem.\nhelping out are Brenda Lee Eager,\nGene Chandler and Jerry Butler.\nThe tracks span a very long period\nof time, from 'Superfly', right back to\n'For your precious love' originally released in 1959.\nMy main criticism with the album\nwould be the studio clapping. Audiences in studios just don't seem to\ncompare with concert audiences and\nthe clapping always appears to be\nfalsely dubbed.\nThere is no doubt that this is soul\nat its best and, although not a great\nsoul fan, I found the change of styles\nand the range of artists were able to\npresent several variations removing\nthat aspect of soul that I find annoy-ing: namely sameness. A highly\nrecommended album for soul lovers.\nadditional information, it is fairly obvious that it was never intended\noriginally that these tracks should be\ncollected on to one album. There are\nflashes of Jimi'sun excelled brilliance\nespecially on 'I'm your Hoochie\nCoochie Man', and it would be difficult to say that the playing is bad anywhere on the album. It is not, how-ever, an album for the casual collector\nand certainly not a Hendrix classic.\nIt would appeal to those avid Hendrix\nfans who insist on collecting all\nmaterial issued and maybe as an\ninteresting addition to a collection\ncontaining two or three other Hendrix albums. Not to be recommended,\nhowever, for a one off Hendrix album.\nCHRIS MILLARD\nBLACK BRITAIN\n(George Allen & Unwin\u00a31.95)\nChris Mullard is an ex-official of\nCARD and presently the Community\nRelations Officer for Tyneside. The\ncover blurb claims that his book\nbrings 'the black voice' to race relations. Mullard himself claims that he\nspeaks as\n'a black who cannot forget he is\nblack, a black born and bred in\nthe UK who still feels an out-cast'.\nFine sentiments, indeed. Most of\nus, whose background is the same\nwould agree that we are still outcasts,\nand that Britain is a racist society.\nHowever, this book gives no answers\nto our questions.\n'Black Britain', a best seller, is\nvery obviously directed at a white\naudience, and loses by it. Mullard is\nat his best when discussing the shortcomings of white society as regards\nracism, and rightly identifies racism\nas 'part and pai to el' of that society.\nHowever, when he starts to talk about\nblacks and what blacks should do to\ndefend themselves, the book immediately loses conviction. The book\nseems to be concerned with pressing\nforward many of the ideas beloved of\nwhite liberals about the revolutionary\nnature of the black working-class. He\nspeaks of imminent race civil war and\nriots a la Watts and Chicago.\nThis view totally ignores the\ncrushing effects of racism. It is clear\nto many blacks in Britain that many of\nus have been broken and that there is\nno possibility of resistance at this\ntime. The effects of colonialism and\nthe break-up of black communities\nwithin the colonies have left their\nmark, a total loss of self-respect and\nself-confidence. And this is where the\nBritish black is crucially different to\nhis American counterpart. Surely the\nfirst task in combating racism is to\nrestore that confidence by the construction Of strong independent communities with a voice in conurbations\nsuch as London, Liverpool and Manchester.\nIt is important for students to confront this problem. The book is as\ngood a place as any to start. The\nsections on the deliberate stagnation\nof the Race Relations industry and on\nthe police are especially worthwhile;\nthe reprint of Ron Phillips' article on\nthe tragic case of David Oluwale\n(where an inspector and sergeant of\nthe Leeds police were indicted for\nmurder, but convicted on numerous\ncharges of assault) is also worth,\nreading. Mullard's comment on assimilation is especially significant as he\nhimself is a half-caste.\n\"Assimilation is a Utopian dream.\nHe cannot work in society today as it>\ndenies the individual the right to an\nidentity of his own. Whilst racist behaviour exists in a society it denies\nany equal relationship between black\nand white . . . . as colour will always\nremain a factor'.\nIn the final analysis, the book fails\nto convince me, and will probably fail\nto convince most blacks; as I said\nbefore, it is for a white audience and\nfails entirely to delineate the origin\nof racism, why it is part of white\nsociety. Maybe the truth is too hard\nto take\u2014for those who don't have to\nlive with it every day.\nTREVOR PHILLIPS.\nTROGGS\nNostalgia was in the\nair last Friday at Imperial College Union. The\nreason? The return of\nthe TROGGS (remember\nthem?). Believe it or not,\nthe Troggs are still going strong and, in fact,\nare receiving rave re-7RIDDLE RHYMES?\nCan you guess the names of the eight living personalities portrayed in these riddle rhymes ?\nAnswers on page 2.\n| He goes around the globe with ease\n# And knows how hard it is to please\nThe people that he meets and sees.\nO His panoramic scenes declare\nHe lives in castles in the air\nAnd knows his onions with his schemes\nOf strange and surrealistic dreams.\n5\nS34 This decent man has raised his voice\nAnd speaks against the things we hide;\nHe makes the British heart rejoice\nAnd tries to give us back our pride.\nHe turns the daylight into night\nAnd hides himself away.\nI wish that he would see the light\nAnd now enjoy the day.\nHe criticises great expense . . .\nAnd many chose to take offence!\nHe criticises great expense . . .\nAnd others praise his common sense!\nO let the knighted prophet speak\nWith sense so sound from week to week.\nFor he can bridge the gap with tact\n\u2014Although he is no knight in fact!\nHe asks his questions like a fox\nAnd makes us think ' How orthodox!\"\n\u2014Yet winter sits within the box\nWith falsehood, truth and paradox.\nHe hears no sound nor speech like you\n\u2014Yet he is a sympathetic kind\nOf man with brain and heart so true\nThat he, with Conscience, speaks his mind.\n\u00a9 N.

His microphone (?!) gestures\nfitted in with the lyrics, lyrics such that their i a test sing te was banned by the BBC (though that doesn't take much nowadays).\nThe other members of the band, whilst being\naccomplished mus'ici an s, seemed to act mainly\nas a backing band to Reg's antics. There is no\ndoubt, however, as to their success. Combining\nnumbers both old and new they presented an act\nthat kept the crowd both happy and shouting for\nmore (twice). Wild Thing, one of their best known\nnumbers, set the crowd moving, especially the\nones in front, near the stage. And, despite the\nfact that one helping had already been presented,\nit was Wild Thing that the crowd requested, and\nreceived, for the final encore.\nThe concert was soon over and once again we\nwere left with just memories. I hope that their true\nfans who were present (including several considerably older than the average student) will\ncherish and remember them.\n\n"

CONTINGENT ON THE8 th FEBRUARY DEMONSTRATION YOUR GRANT IS AT STAKE\nThe Postgraduate Newspaper of Imperial College\nIssue No. 9\n5th February 1974\nEDITORIAL\nA new format for P.G. News No. 9. If you haven't seen it before, you will realise that you've been\nmissing out. Well, now that P.G. News has taken\nover Felix (for one week, and then only if you re-fold it to make this the front page) everyone has a chance to see that post grads all over College are\nsitting up only to see their grants flying out of the\nwindow. How would you like to be the first post-grad ever to go on a demo? Find out on February\n8th. You've got more to lose than anyone else.\nWhen you've read this page, fold P.G. News so\nthat this is the front, and put on someone else's desk. If you see a copy incorrectly folded, re-fold\nit: Spread the word. Right. Power to the post grad. DEMONSTRATING\nPROPOSALS\n;\nThere shall initially cie r ttl y large that the\nbe two'hourly rates: \"ideal\" rate be reached.\nNow incorporating Felix\n. (1) The \"ideal\" rate\nWhich would be paid if\nthe pay laws permitted.\nFor Session '73/'74,\nthis figure is \u00a32 per hour.\n(2) The \" Pay Law\"\nrate. Which for Session\n'73/'74, after November\n7th is \u00a31.15 plus 5 7 ip for preparation time.\nThe \"ideal\" rate shall\nbe tied to the lower end\nof the lecturers pay\nscale, so that it increases each year by the\nsame percentage as that\npay scale.\nThe \"Pay Law\" rate is\nthe maximum pay al lowed by the pay board\nfor demonstrating.\nInitially, demonstrators will be paid at the\n\"pay law' rate. We propose that the College\nautomatically apply to\nthe pay board (or its\nsuccessor) every year on\nOctober 1st for an increase which will bring\nthe effective rate up to\nthe \"ideal rate\". We\nWill accept a lower rate\nonly if it is the maximum rate allowed by the\npay 'board.\nIn the following circumstances the payment for demonstrating\nwill revert to the \"ideal\"\nrate:\n(1) If the pay laws are\nabolished.\n(2) if the pay laws\nallow an increase suf fi Preparation time.\nThe College is concerned that if the rate of\n\u00a32 plus annual increments is paid, in future\nyears there will be another claim for preparation time. We therefore\nagree that the \"ideal\"\nrate is an amount sufficiently high that a responsible demonstrator\nwill come to a practical\nwell prepared and will\nbe willing to help a student outside his/her hours\nof employment.\nBut\nthat:\nwe recognise\n(1) It must always remain negotiable that\npreparation time be paid\nin respect of a situation\nwhere a greater than\nnormal amount of preparation is necessary.\n(2) Tutoring, because\nit requires much more\npreparation than demonstrating should normally\nbe paid at twice the\nnormal rate for demon-st rating. It should be noted in\nthis context that preparation time is only\nnormally 50 per cent,\nand can be higher in\ncertain circumstances.\n(3) We consider that\nthe setting up of experiments does not constitute normal preparation\nand should be paid\nseparately.\nJ END OF GRANTS IS INSIGHT A Government report was published\non Wednesday 23rd of Jan. which, if im-ple men ted, will have\na fundamental effect\non Postgraduate\neducation.\nThe education and\narts sub-committee of\nthe Expenditure Committee, made up of\nmembers from all three\nmain parties in the\nHouse of Commons, proposes that there should\nbe radical changes in\nthe system of Postgraduate education and that\nPostgraduates should be\nfinanced by loans. The\nreport makes some valid\ncriticisms Of the present\nsystem, but its main\nthesis is that Postgrad,\neducation should be\nmore cost-effective and\nshould be tailored to the\nneeds of Government\nand Industry. To this\nend the present grants\nsystem would be abolished and replaced by\neither Government or\ncommercially financed\nloans \u2014 in addition the\nnumber of students\nwould be cut back. The\nrole of independent University research is\nlargely ignored, and\nPostgraduate education\nis envisaged in terms of\nproviding refresher courses and specialist training for students on\nrelease from Industry. In\nconclusion the report\nstates that suCh a system would help contain\npublic expenditure and\npromote equality of opportunity (sic).\nLOANS\nIMPLEMENTATION\nSOON\nIf the proposals are\nimplemented Postgraduates will be virtually in\nthe position of paying\nfor Tine privilege of\nparrying out research. In\nmost countries training\nin research is treated as\nemployment and paid\nfor as such. The recommendations of the report\nshould be seen as yet\nanother attack on a higher education system\nwhich is already biased\nagainst students from\nworking class families.\nThe Government probably thinks that it can\nestablish the principle of\nloan financing by attacking the sector which is\ntraditionally least organ-is ed. Next perhaps will\nbe loans for Undergraduates. PGs should\ndemonstrate their total\nopposition to any proposals for changes in the\nPostgraduate education\nsystem which involve\nloan finance.\nEXPLOITATION OF\nTHIRD WORLD\nThe proposals include\nthe recommendation that\nfees for overseas students should be increased\nto cover the full cost of\ntheir courses. This\nwould mean an increase\nfrom \u00a3 2 5 0 to around\n\u00a31,500.\n(The ICPGG is obtaining several copies of the\nreport which is entitled\n'Third Report from the\nExpenditure Committee,\nEducation and Arts SubCommittee, Session\n1973-74, Postgraduate\nEducation, Volume 1.\nCommons paper 96.\nHMS O34p. For information contact Pete Cannel. Maths PG or John\nPorter, Materials Science\nPG).\nSTOP\nPRESS\nThe seriousness with\nwhich postgraduates\nthroughout the country\nare viewing the report of\nthe Commons Expenditure Committee is illustrated by the fact that\nHMSO sold out two\ndays after publication.\n(How many did they\nprint?).\nLONDON P.G. GROUP The group was formed\nin November 1973 as a result of the growing\nactivity among Postgraduates throughout\nthe University on issues\ns i_f ch as demonstrating\npayments and the grants\ncampaign. Since that\ntime meetings have been\nregular, and have been\nused to co-ordinate\naction in the colleges\nand to provide information and ideas for the\nCollege based groups.\nAt the most recent meeting on 17th January,\nseveral Colleges reported that their demons t raft ing rates had been\nraised (along with Imperial's) to \u00a31.15, a rise\nof 15 pence. There is a small hope of getting\nthis payment increased\nslightly by exploiting\none of the Pay Board\nclauses on anomalies,\nbut given the present\nstrength and organisation of the Postgraduate\nmovement, most delegates agreed that the\nbest approach was to\nnegotiate agreements\nWith College authorities\nto take effect as soon as\nwage restraint is ended.\nYOUR GRANT\nBy N.U.S. \u2014if it still exists in '75\nThe claim is based on the 1968 undergraduate\ngrant, raised according to the NUS student cost\nindex. The Board and Lodging costs are based on London. The NUS claim for undergraduates is \u00a3770\nfor London, Oxford and Cambridge students and\n\u00a3 6 5 5 for others. This latter figure is similar to the\namount put forward by the CVC P. The present figure\nis \u00a3695, next year it could be nothing.\nThe PG Claim (in fact the claim for all students\nWho require 44 weeks or more attendance) is based\non the UG claim and is broken down as follows:\nUG\u00a3 PG\u00a3 PG/UG Element\nRatio\n61.28 13.95 5/22 Vacation\n66.11 103.57 47/30 Course\n20.00 31.33 47/30 Travel\n65.01 109.22 52/30 Clothes\n65.19 112.99 52/30 Pocket\n445.36\nMoney\n445.36 771.96 52/30 Accom'tion\n767.97 1143.11\n(770) (1145)\nP.G.

All have certain qualities in\ncommon, however; enthusiasm and an incomprehensible desire to do\ntheir singing while desperately trying to concentrate on whether to\nuse expression A or expression B, and Whom to\nfollow in the next dance.\nApart from the cast we\nhave a very proficient,\nspirited and, some might\nsay, ageless miscellany\nof instrumentalists,\nknown loosely as the\norchestra, and a crew of\nhighly dedicated, semi-nocturnal individuals\nwho. with great help\nfrom Dramsoc, achieve\nmiracles each year to\ncreate a realistic set,\nwhile at the same time\nleaving the performers\nenough room to swing a semi breve on the hopelessly inadequate concert hah stage.\nTraditionally ICOS\ngives two shows each\nyear: one at IC in February and a tour show in\nJuly, this year featuring\n\"HMS Pinafore\". In recent years, however,\nsingle performances of\nshort one-act comic\noperas have been pro-duce d, this year's being\n\"Trial by Jury\" on\nThursday, March 21st as\na lunchtime concert.\nThe highlight of the\nyear is undoubtedly the\nsummer tour to Budleigh\nSalterton, which for 50\nweeks of the year is a peaceful little South\nDevon holiday resort.\nHere, lured by the prospects of singing, swim-ming, sunning, social is ing, and cider swilling\nand other things beginning with V( not necessarily in that order), 70\nenthusiasts arrive to a rapturous welcome. As our reputation in that\ncultural wilderness\ngrows in leaps and\nbounds, we attract 2,000\npeople each year, and\nlast year raised over\n\u00a360 in a charity concert\nof classical music in the\nlocal church (not bad\nafter only one day's re-hears al). If ICOS are so brill i ant, you say, why can't you try real opera such\nas Verdi, Wagner or\nEngelbert Humperdinck,\ninstead of mere Gilbert\nand Sullivan. Each year\nwe ask ourselves the\nsame question, and inevitably reach the same\nconclusions; that G&S is virtually the only\nj choice for a society\nwishing to maintain\nmaximum involvement\nfor all members while\nbeing limited in terms of\nfacilities, expenditure\nand rehearsal time. G&S also has the advantage\nof being easy to appreciate for the average scientist and engineer who is\nprepared to look at it\nobjectively for one night\n(not everyone can have\nthe cultural awareness\nof the aesthetic mines-man). Even the most\nsceptical beings have\nbeen taken along to a show under duress only\nto confess later that it\nwas the funniest thing\nthey'd seen for a long\ntime. I must, however,\nsym pathis e with the person who still has nightmares about being\nconscripted as one of\nthe 'three little maids\nfrom school' by an uncompromising music\nmaster in need of boy\nsopranos.\nSullivan's music can\nbe said to be full of\ncatchy tunes, sometimes\nunashamedly adapted\nfrom the works of pom-posers such as Mozart\nand Handel, who, no\ndoubt, have been turning in their graves ever\nsince. Gilbert, the lib-bret is t of the duo, was\na master of parody,\nchoosing as his victims,\npeople or events in the\npublic eye at the turn of\nthe century, although\nsome of his innuendos,\nintentional or not (I wonder) wouldn't disgrace the likes of\nFrankie Howerd.\nI hope the few who've\nhad the will power to\nread this far will come\nalong in February to see\nwhat I mean. Tickets\n(here comes the crunch)\nare 30p,40p or 50p, on\nsale in the Union entrance from January\n28th. Any other enquiries\nabout the society are\nwelcome via the Union\nletter rack.\nROGER NICHOLLS,\nChairman.\nINDIA\nSOCIETY\nOne of the largest\nsocial societies in College is the India Society.\nWith a membership of\nnearly 100, this society\naims to provide varied\nentertainment and give\nstudents an insight into\nthe Indian way of life.\nWithout a shade of\ndoubt, we have been\nperhaps the most active\nsocial society during the\nlast term. One of the\nmajor highlights of 'last\nterm was the performance of Shakuntala Devi,\nIndia's human calculating machine. This function proved to be very\npopular and was well\nattended. Other functions included an Indian\nsong and dance feature\nplus did io to mark the\ncelebration of Diwali,\nthe Indian festival of\nlights. In December,\neven with our limited\nfunds, we managed to\nstage a film show\u2014an\n\"end of term\" function.\nAll these functions\nwere well attended and\nwere significant successes \u2014 one, because our\npublicity tends to be as\nfar-reaching as possible,\nand two, we have cooperation with the India\nSocieties of other Colleges of London University.\nFUNCTIONS\nWe intend to hold\nmore functions this\nterm, but these may be\nheld up due to the energy situation. The energy\nsituation permitting, the\nhighlights of this term\nshould be a celebration\non the occasion of\nIndia's Republic Day\nWhich fell on 26th January, and an inter-university India societies'\ntournament, normally\nheld in MarkbeSter.\nTeams from India Societies of London, Leeds,\nheld in Manchester.\nSaiford, etc., compete\nfor the Air India Cup,\nWhich is donated by Air\nIndia in co-operation\nwith the Indian High\nCommission. The games\nplayed are soccer, table-tennis, badminton, hockey, etc., and the\ncompetition is - very\nkeen. However, this\nevent has not been finalised yet.\nIndia Society has direct liaison with the Indian High Commission,\nand their periodical,\nIndia Weekly, is available in the Haldane\nLibrary.\nOne other feature of\nour functions is that we\nhave Indian food for sale\nat reasonably (p heap prices.\nMembership (12\u00a3p) of the society is Stj'll\nopen. We do try to cater\nfor as many tastes as we\ncan afford to \u2014 in some\nof our functions a definite blend with the Western way of life is\nnoticeable!

So we are one\nof the largest societies in\ncollege, and one that is\ngrowing at the moment.\nWhat de we do?\nThis varies enormously but ir eludes: times of\nprayer; studying the\nBible together; listening\nto expositions of parts of\nthe Bible relevant to\nmodern problems; an\nannual house party with\npeople from other colleges in SW London;\nGeneral Studies lectures\n(e.g. this year on Christianity and Communism);\n'open meetings'; international receptions; parties and outings .for\noverseas students. Main\nmeetings each week are\nheld on Fridays from\n6.30 p.m. in the Maths\nLibrary, 53 Princess Gardens, and all are we l come.\nConcern leads to\naction!\nOur beliefs are positive and concern leads\nto action and social in-vol ve ment. Some members of the CU help to\nrun a service each week\nfor the patients in a local\nhospital. We also seek\nto help overseas relations, by helping rather\nthan protesting, and run\nspecial activities and\nfunctions for students\nfrom other countries\nwho often arrive here\nlonely, depressed, and\nwith few friends; to\nmake them feel web ome in a practical way. We\naren't in competition\nwith other societies in\nthis respect, and members help in these as\nthey feel fit.\nAnd the rest of London?\nBesides close ties with\ncolleges in SW London,\nthe CU is affiliated to\nUnions in all the other\ncolleges of the University (with Whom there are\nclose connections also),\nand nationally too. Despite this we are a student\norientated, entirely stud-ent-run body.\nHow can I join?\nFull membership can\nbe obtained by signing a declaration of faith, and\nby actively supporting\nthe aims Of the Union.\nThere are many, but\nbasically to present the\nclaims of Jesus Christ\nto people in the college,\nand to form a united\nbody of those Who\ndesire to serve him\nhere.\nAll activities are open\nto all members of the\nCollege \u2014 why not get\nhold of a termly programme card from one\nof the members \u2014 the\nbest way of finding out\nabout the CU is by coming along and getting to\nknow us.\nBut . . .\n'I go to church any-way.*\nh in e, the CU isn'ta church, rather we seek\nto show a working unity\nbetween Christians Of\nall backgrounds and denominations in the col-le ge.'I can't accept the\nBible.'\nMeetings in Central\nLondon on Saturday\nevenings have attracted\nupwards of 300 students,\nwho do believe it holds\nthe key to contemporary\n(and eternal) problems\nfaced by man.

BUDGETS\nAT A STROKE\nThe Under Secretary for Education,\nMr. Timothy Raison, last week an-noun ced, in a written answer, that\nUniversities as their part of the cutback on education, will lose around\n\u00a331.75m next academic year\u2014and\nfurther reductions are likely.\nThis confirmed the fears of many\nacademics and students, who predicted that a great deal of pressure was\nto be put on University financing this\nyear. The cuts have been made as\nfollows:\nthe \u00a316.75 million 'inflation\ngrant' to Universities, which is\ndesigned to compensate for increased non-academic staff salaries and increases in the cost\nof furniture is removed\na reduction from \u00a335.25m to\n\u00a315m in the furniture and equip-men grant.\nThis means that we can only buy\nhalf as many benches, chairs, etc.\u2014\nand that is assuming that the prices\nstay the same l There is much confusion amongst\nVCs as to how the budget cuts are\nto be met, but two things are certain:\nuniversities will not be able to admit\nes many students this year, as they\nhoped (and signs are that applications\nare up) and that many retiring staff\nwill not be replaced.\nMr. Raison indicated that further\ncuts are likely: 'Further savings will\nbe found from the further and higher\neducation sectors . . . ' He said that\nhe was in touch with the UGC about\nfurther reductions that would now be\nnecessary.\nThe Times Higher Education Supplement (January 25th) predicts that,\neven optimistically speaking, university budgets for the next three years\nhave been cut by about \u00a3100m and\nthat \u00a3150m worth of buildings have\nbeen postponed. Furthermore, the\ntargets for numbers of students in\nuniversity by 1977, will be drastically\nreduced, specially affecting universities like Lancaster where applications\nare up by 22.5 per cent on last year.\nReaction by the universities has\nbeen muted but losses have been\nestimated at up to \u00a3800,000 (Oxford,\nCambridge and Manchester). Universities of a size and nature comparable\nto IC such as Lancaster, Sheffield,\nSussex and Salford may lose up to\n\u00a3250,000.\nNo official reaction has been forthcoming from the College.\nDEMONSTRATE\nALL OUT This Friday, February\n8th, sees what is hoped\nwill be a massive demonstration in London by\nstudents from all over\nthe country to express\ntheir dissatisfaction with\nthe present grants' system and the apparent\nlack of action by this\nGovernment to remedy\nthe situation.\nThe demonstration in\nthe form of a march, will\nbegin at Waterloo and\nprogress via the D.E.S. to Hyde Park where there\nwill be a rally addressed\nby NUS and trade union\nspeakers.\nThe disgraceful state\nof affairs which has\nbrought about the need\nfor this demonstration.\nBID TO OUST RANDALL An attempt to oust the president, Mr. John Randall, will be made at the NUS conference at Liverpool, in April. Mr. Stuart Paul, an executive mem-ber, has broken convention of a formal re-election\nof the president for his second year.\nMr. Paul (26, Glaswegian and Labour Party)\nrs a member of the Broad Left group of the executive, which constitutes a majority of the Executive. There are ten members of the Broad Left\ngroup on the Executive of 16. In a letter to student leaders (including several IC members) at\nthe weekend, Mr. Paul accuses Mr. Randall of a lack of leadership and policy in the grants cam-pa ign. Stuart Paul, with an impeccable working class\nbackground, went over well at the last NUS conference in Margate. Mr. Paul's popularity may\naccount for the Broad Left decision to break the\ntwo-year convention.\nMr. Randall last week dated his disagreement\nwith the executive Broad Left group from the\ntime when he was elected president. He accused\nMr. Paul of risking the unity of the NUS by embarking on a campaign based on personality and\nof whipping up policy differences where none\nexisted.\nAPPOINTMENT\nOF NEW\nPRO-RECTOR\nPROFESSOR M.G. FLEMING has been appointed Pro Rector of Imperial College from 1 September, 1974 in succession to Professor B.G. Neal.\nOn his appointment as Pro Rector, Professor\nFleming will cease to be Head of the Department\nof Mining and Mineral Technology but will retain\nhis chair.\nMAGGIE VISITS I.C. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher graced Imperial College with her presence\non the day of issue of\nthe last Felix. She was\npresent for an inaugural\nlecture given by Professor Afastair Cameron\n(Professor of Lubrication\nEngineering in the Department of Mechanical\nEngineering), the title of\nwhich was 'Fundamental\nresearch in an industrial\nworld'.\nThe president, Norman Sayles, and the\nHon. Secretary, Paul\nWadsworth, learnt of the\nvisit at the last moment.\nThey discovered that\nshe was to be present at\nthe Hall Dinner that\nsame evening and they\narranged to be present\nalso. At the end of the\nmeal, as Mrs. Thatcher\nwas leaving with the rec-tor, Sir Brian Flowers,\nMessrs. Sayles and\nWadsworth presented\nher with a letter. This reiterated the case for the\nvarious aspects of the\ngrants campaign, with\nspecial reference to the\ncut-backs in spending\nannounced the previous\nday.\nMrs. Thatcher accepted the letter, thanking\nthem for the way in\nwhich the presentation\nwas done (i.e. no mass\ndemonstrations) and\npromised to reply.\nCopies of the letter\nare available from the\nHon. Secretary, Mr. Wadsworth, In the Union\noffice.\nSOAS SICKS STUDENT\nThe London University\nSchool of Oriental and\nAfrican Studies has\nsacked one of its students after she had pleaded guilty to a drugs\ncharge.\nThe student, Gloria\nGeorge, 19, admitted\npossessing 114 milligrams of cannabis, three\nLSD tablets, and attempting to pass drugs\nto another person. She\nspent two weeks in remand and was sentenced\nto two years probation.\nWhilst she was in\nprison she received a let-ler from the college saying that her course had\nbeen terminated because\nshe had fallen too far\nbehind with her work.\nThis was despite the\nfact that she is supposedly one of the most\nbrilliant on her course,\nand had arranged to have\nher books with her in\nprison.\nMr. David Mudd, MP for Falmouth and Camborne (Gloria's local\nMP) has taken tip her\ncase. He stated that he\nwas in agreement with\nsacking s inflicted on\nevery student already\nknows about. Discretionary awards which do not\naffect people taking University degree courses\nare preventing people\nfrom gaining qualifications in Higher e duca tion. How many friends\ndo you know, though at\ntraining and further education college who are\nbeing hampered by this\nsituation? Shouldn't you\nbe voicing your support\nfor them? Why should\nthe desire for qualifications in order to better\noneself or gain a better\njob be made difficult and\nfurther education be a privilege of the rich? The\ninadequacy in the\nGrants' system which\ns very one of us at I.C. knows about, is of course\n\u2022 the Means Test. It is obvious to everyone\u2014except apparently those\npeople who are in a position to do something\nabout it that this idea\nshould be abolished in\nfavour of a full grant in\nevery student's own po c ket, and such a tax levied on parents which\nwould be less harsh than\nthe present unfair parental contribution scheme.\nPostgraduates probably have the rawest deal\nof all since they are, in\nfact, being penal is ed for\nhaving gained a first degree in as much as their\ngrant per week (a disgustingly inadequate\n\u00a313.40) is less than that\nof an undergraduate.\nThey have also just been\nsurprised by government\nproposals which could\nmean that those wishing\nto pursue postgraduate\ncourses would be required to borrow from the\ngovernment the money\nto finance themselves.\nIt has also been re cog people guilty of drug of-fences. 'However,' he\nsaid, 'I am most concerned that on this occasion it looks as if an obscure and unrelated reason has been used to\nsend Gloria packing'. He\nis asking the university\nauthorities to grant\nGloria and her father a personal interview on\nher appeal against dis-missal.\nAt a ULU SRC meeting last week Gloria's case was discussed.\nn is ed that the actual level of Undergraduate\ngrants is at its lowest\nebb ever. Even the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals\n(C. V.C.R.) have indicated that a figure of \" At least \u00a3 6 3 0 \" is needed\nfor students living away\nfrom home at Universities other than London,\nCambridge and Oxford,\nto bring the grants back\nto a level comparable to\nthat of 1962. This is in line with the NUS demand for \u00a3655. Due to\nour apathy and inactivity\nhowever,, wil il the Government be led into\nthinking that we will be\nhappy with another \u00a3 2 0\nincrease? How have WE shown how serious our\nneeds are? How have\nWE publicised our\nplight? Rent strikes have\nfailed, petitions nowadays carry little weight,\niso what have we left?\nThis demonstration on\nFriday gives every student a final opportunity\nbefore the Government\nannouncement to level\ntheir weight to the action\nfor a fair Grants system\nfor everyone who wishes\nto gain further education.\nObviously there will\nbe factions on the Demonstration who will not\nbe prepared merely to\nsupport Grants action\nbut who will be demanding the removal of the\npresent Government and\nsolidarity With every other trade union which is\ncur ren ly involved in industrial disputes with\nthe Government. I put it\nto you that the more sensible students Who\npeacefully participate on\nFriday the more representative of those people\nwanting to study the Demonstration will be, and\nthus the more public support we Will get for our\nplight.\nFor I.C. Students the\nmeeting place for the\nDemonstration will be\nthe one and only (thank\ngoodness), that remnant\nof Victorian splendour\n(?)\u2014you've guessed it;\nThe Queen's tower at\n11.30 a.m. on FRIDAY,\nthe 8th February. See\nyou there!!!!!!\nG.S. By an average student\nfrom I.C. "

Many put the fault with the Left\nWing but I do not feel this is the main problem.\nThe Left certainly do waste a great deal of time and\neffort at UGM's by their fragmenting structure, i.e. different left wing groups putting forward what is\nBasically the same view differing only in degree.\nREADERSHIP\n'The crux of the matter, I believe, is, as was stated\nby Trev Phillips at Council last Monday, that we\nHave a problem of Leadership. As chairman of SCAB\nI am responsible not only to Council but also to the\nU GM \u2014 it actually says so in the constitution.\nWe have on Council, six floor reps who are there to\nrepresent the floor of the Union. They, and other\npeople in positions of responsibility (here I include\nmyself), are content to sit back and discuss whatever comes up at UGMs and not actually put forward the views of the membership. People at the\ntop are taking ego-trips and not really representing\nthe floor. All Union officers and in particular the\nfloor reps, should be going into the bars and coffee\nareas and talking to people, all the people, and asking them what they want to see done. Then motions\nwould be brought to Union Meetings which concern\npeople and people will come and discuss them.\nFLOOR REPS\nWe have six floor reps: John, Berry, Physics 3;\nCaroline Bingham, Physics 3; Charlie Lewis, Mech\nEng 3; Paul Watkins, Mech Eng PG; Mike Williams,\nChem 3; and Nigel Sedgwick, Physics 3. They\nshould be asking people what they want done but if\nf hey don't then the people must tell them. You are\nthe people, you go and make the Union leadership\nsit up and listen and get their fingers out. It's your\nUnion and that's what it's there for.\nThe floor reps are in the bars most of the time so\nHell them (or any other member of Council for that\nmatter) what you want done. MIKE SIMMONS\nLIFTS\nBreakdown Procedure\n1. General\nThere are some eighty-seven lifts in the College;\nall are by law subject to regular (independent) inspection and maintenance. From time to time, how-ever, lifts do inevitably suffer from defects and\nbreakdowns and the following paragraphs set out\nthe correct a pti on to be taken.\n2. Breakdowns\n\u00abi) Until the engineer's \"out of action\" notice\nappears by the lift, it must always be assumed\nthat\n(a) no-one else has reported the breakdown;\n(b) people are trapped in the lift.\nThe breakdown must be reported at once to the\nMessenger or outside normal hours the Security Guard on the building. In ordinary hours\nthe Messenger will ring the Buildings Office\n(Maintenance) Int. Tel. No. 3954, which is\nthe normal 'hot-line' for service breakdowns\nrequiring immediate action. An engineer will\nbe sent immediately to release anyone\ntrapped. Outside normal hours, at weekends,\nduring College holidays, the Messenger or\nSecurity Guard will ring the College Operations Engineers (Int. Tel. No. 3838, GPO\n589 3630) who are based on the Boiler\nHouse. Again an engineer will be sent at once\nto the lift.\nIf trapped in a lift, operate the alarm button.\nWhere possible the Messenger will acknowledge this by illuminating the panel marked\n\"Alarm received\" or some similar phrase. The\nbreakdown drill will bring a College engineer\nto your rescue within very few minutes.\nLOW TO P3 Defects\nWhen minor defects are not i bed which do not\nrequire immediate action (e.g. loose push-buttons,\nindicator lights not working, etc.), these also should\nbe reported to the Messenger who will report on\nthe standard defects form to the Buildings Office\n(Maintenance) .\n4. DO NOTS\n(i) Do not assume a broken down lift to be empty.\n(;ii) Do not attempt to ring the lift manufacturers\ndirect \u2014 the maintenance of the lift is not\nnecessarily in his hands.\nii'H) Do not attempt to use the set of door release\nand motor room keys held in every messen-ger's box \u2014 these are for engineers only.\nThe report by the\nCommons Select Committee on Expenditure,\nentitled Postgraduate\nEducation', amongst other things, proposes the\nintroduction of postgraduate loans, a severe\nreduction in the numbers\nof students allowed to\ngo straight on to become\nPGs after a first degree,\nand a requirement that\noverseas students pay\nfull fees, amounting to\nsome \u00a31,500 per annum.\nThe entire report is\nconcerned with the cost\nof graduate education\nrather than its nature,\nand most of the proposals are ways of saving\nmoney. However, behind\nthis, the Report Indicates\nthat greater Government\ncontrol over postgraduate education is necessary, and that PGs\nshould have closer links\nwith industry. To these\nends a central body to\ncontrol the postgraduate\nsector is suggested, the\nPostgraduate Advisory\nCouncil.\nThe Committee believes that the majority\nof PGs should not be\nfuture academics, but\nshould be graduates who\nhave worked in industry\nand who have settled in\ncareers, where postgraduate work would be\nrelevant and advantage-o us. It suggests that\nindustrial experience\nshould be a criterion for\nbecoming a PG. Junior\nlecturers would be graduates who, while lect ur ing, are working for their\nPhDs.\nThe report would also\nremove from the Research Council, the power to award Research\nFellowships. Rather more\ndisturbing, is the suggestion that 50 per cent\nof PGs in British Universities \u2014 overseas PGs\n\u2014 should be f once d to\npay around \u00a31,500 pa in\nfees. This is no doubt\none way, as the committee sees it, of justifiably\nreducing expenditure,\nbut is certain to create a massive fur ore in the\nUniversities, both amongst the staff and\nstudents.\nIt is suggested that\nthis report has a long\nway to go before implementation. But according to the Times Higher\nEd:\n\" A report from the\nsame committee in 1972\nwas soundly rebuffed by\nthe government last sum-mer. This year it has\nproduced an account-ant's report which may\nhave more appeal to an\naccountant's government\nwhich thinks little of\npursuing a course of intellectual asset stripping\nwhen the going gets\nrough\".\nClearly the Report is\nnot the last word, by\nany means.\n1CT Jnk\nMEETING\nA meeting of the\nImperial College Tenants\nAssociation was held re-cent ly. This meeting,\nthough not very well\nattended, managed to\nproduce some important\ndecisions.\nThe constitution had\none or two minor amendments made to it and\nwas then officially accepted as the ICTA constitution. The main changes\nwere the lowering of the\nquorum to 75 and that\nthe people on rent strike\nshould make the decision as to where the\ninterest from the rent\nfund should go, and also\nwhen the strike should\nfinish.\nMr. Salisbury, Physics\nI, presented his chair-man's report. At the\ntime of the meeting there\nwere 67 people on rent\nstrike, (71 now\u2014Ed.),\ngiving approximately\n\u00a33,000 in the fund.\nThere were as yet about\n98 people to pay to\neither college or the\nstrike fund.\nIt was agreed that the\nnext meeting of ICTA\nshould be held on a Sunday evening at 6.00 as\nthis seemed to be a successful time when it was\nlast used.\nThere was a discussion on the aims of\nICTA. It was pointed out\nby a number of people\nthat ICTA did not exist\nsolely for the rent strike\nand that it should continue when the strike is\nover. The following\nideas were put forward\nas items that ICT A should concern itself\nwith: House wardens\nentertainments allow-ance, ICTA sports league, financing of halls\nand houses, affiliation\nto other tenants' associations. There is, of\ncourse, no reason why\nno other items should be\nconsidered. For more information contact Paul\nWadsworth, Union Office, or your local\nha 11/house representative (see last Felix).\nIt is hoped that more\npeople will take an interest in the next meeting,\nespecially as it is the\nintention of ICTA to represent and help organise anything concerned\nwith halls and houses.\nOVERSEAS PEOPLE\nPeople from the developing countries of Asia,\nAfrica and Latin America are being sought by Oxfam's Central London branch for a new voluntary\ngroup designed to back up the agency's worldwide\ndevelopment programme.\nThe group Will have two principal functions: to\nadvise on policies that would encourage a more\npositive public attitude towards world development\nand to help generate new support for Oxfam's work.\nIt will be one of several special groups recently set\nup by Oxfam in London.\n\"There are many people from the Third World in\nLondon, either studying or working, and we hope\nthat quite a few of them will be keen to help in a practical way\", said Oxfam organiser Jeannie\nMurray. \" We don't expect them to endorse automatically everything we do \u2014 in fact, we hope the\nGroup will produce new ideas by challenging some\nof the current assumptions about development aid\".\nTo stimulate better public understanding of development issues, Oxfam is currently working\nthrough four other special groups, in the travel in-dust ry, the medical and legal professions and the\nCivil Service. The first Overseas Group will be limited to people living in or around London. Anyone\ninterested in further information should contact\nMiss Jeannie Murray, Oxfam Regional Office, 12\nCrane Court, Fleet Street, London EC4. Tel: 353\n5701.\nTOUCHSTONE\nI'm always amazed when I return from a Touchstone weekend, how many people don't know what\nI 've been doing for the last day. If you fall into this\ncategory (shame on you, you didn't read the last\nreport) it is basically a discussion weekend where\npeople can air their views on the proposed (and\nmore usually, the not proposed) subject, which is\nso chosen so that there is no right or wrong point\nof view, so people with fiery tempers beware.\nThis week's subject was on 'The Responsibility of\nScientists' and the speaker was Mr. Frost, a lecturer\nin science studies, in the extra-mural department of\nLondon Universities. He gave an interesting talk on\nmodes of thinking, ma them a tico logical processes, the\nmaking of distinctions, and a comparison of tech-no logy, practical science and school science in their\nproblems, solutions, and actions. The talk led nicely\nu,p to the proposed questions for discussion which\nwere:\n1 The comparison of scientists with other groups\nregarding their concern about social difficulties arising from, and not from, their own work, their\neffectiveness in initiating change and averting dan-gers, and also of their responsibility to be responsible.2 How far disposition towards particular modes of\nthinking are either present at birth, matters of free\nchoice, or conditioned either by social environment,\nformal education arid training, or by accidents of\npersonal experience, and how these dispositions correlate between career choice.\n3 i Considering the role of the mass media in alerting scientists to matters over which they may wish\" to\ntake up responsible attitudes.\nii Should providers of formal science education accept responsibility for fostering in their pupils\n(a.) responsible modes of thinking\n(b) attitudes to specific situations\nHi What may or -can be done for adult scientists no\nlonger subject to formal education and training?\nG JK CONTACT WEEK\nThis week is a very\nimportant time in the\nyear for many people in\nand around IC \u2014 a week\nof prayer, worship, and\ncoming together. A week\ncalled CONTACT.\nThroughout the year,\ngroups have been meeting regularly all over the\ncoP leg e, to share a small\npart of their fives with\nothers. In the halls and\nhouses students and\n)chaplains share breakfast or coffee, and in the\ndepartments they come\ntogether for lunch. Each\ngroup is very different\nfrom the others, but in\nall of them the emphasis\nis on contact \u2014 with\neach other, with the outside world, and with\nGod.\nThis week people are\ncoming from all over the\ncountry to help us realise what contact really\nmeans. In many ways\nthey represent the outside world. They come\nfrom very different backgrounds \u2014 from an engineer (ex IC) through a housewife and a teacher\nto a German Jesuit. In\nother ways they represent Christ, bringing\ntheir experience of Him\nto us.\nA large selection of\nevents has been organised for the groups to\nshare with each other,\nbut they are also meeting individually with the\nmembers of the CONTACT team. The events,\nincluding a teach-in on\nbasic Christianity, an\naward-winning film, and\na folk service and party,\nare widely advertised on\nyellow posters. So if you\nfind something that interests you, or you just\nwant to make contact,\ncome along. You'll be\nvery welcome.\nSUE ARNOLD, Phys. 2.\nWest London\nChaplaincy,\n\n"

Despite the fact that\nthe Third team had beaten the seconds, 2-1, earlier\nin the season, the Seconds were confident of victory\u2014too confident.\nOne weakness of the Seconds this season is the\nmidfield. By hard running and determination the\nThirds started to dominate the midfield With Mike\nButterworth and Mike Jakeman in control. The\nSecond team midfield with the exception of Alan\nPeterson, was non-existent. The Thirds started\npiling on the pressure and it became only a matter\nof time before they would score. After twenty\nminutes Mick Butterworth brought a cross from\nthe right down and slammed it home. Still confident the Seconds thought this was only a temporary setback but were brought to earth ten minutes\nlater. After a mix (Cock) up between Dave Pervis\nand goalkeeper John Thornback, Rob Holmes intercepted a back pass and chipped the ball over\nthe keeper's head to make it 2-0, the half-time\nscore.\nThe Second team still failed to find their form\nand from a long through ball Rob Holmes scored\nhis second to make it 3-0 to the Third team. The\nSecond team now lost their tempers, became frantic and were totally ragged at the back. Karol Senkin saved further humiliation by kicking the ball\noff the line. The Second team restored some of\ntheir pride towards the end when Billie Pike\nscored. The goal followed a poor gc at ki ek, an unnoticed handball and then only just trickled over\nthe line from amis kick. Substitute Colin 'Skouse'\nHigham hit the post at the very end. And so it finished 3-1 to the Third team. They do say the cup\nis full of surprises.\nTeams: Seconds: J.( TootswaHower) Thornback, R.(G. rule OK) Young, K. Senkin, Dave ('s defected) Pervis, M. Manning, A 'Fulwelt' Peterson (Capt.), J. Miles, T. Fricher,\nB. Day, M. Clarke, B. Pike, Sub. C. Higham.\nThirds:\u2014 R. Colston, C. Anastasi, R. Ferret, J. Hey\n(Capt), J. Hope, M.( Kamikzi) Butterworth, M. Jakeman,\n1. Ponton, T(I 've been here longer than Bob) Richards, P. Singlton, R. Holmes.\nIC V3 v Birkbeck III 1\nAlso at Harlington the Fifth team beat Birkbeck\nThirds by three goals to one. In the first hah, how-ever, they defended desperately and only good\nwork in defence by Steve Parsons and Super Star\nRoger Hunter kept the score down to one-nil to\nBirkbeck. Aften ten minutes of the second half\nRog Hunter scored brilliantly (his words) from a penalty and a minute later the Birkbeck fullback\nscored an own goal. Feeling very despondent the\nBirkbeck players now started blaming the ref and\narguing amongst themselves. A small black mon-gr el, having a rest from the other game, now\nmade a small appearance before being sent off\u2014\nwith the aid of a boot. A Dhiflon free kick floated\nover the goalkeeper and the Fifths were now home\nend dry winning three goals to one. Mike Heshmati, Rog (Super P***) Hunter and Steve Parsons\nall played well but the best player was undoubtedly\nReft Bates.\nCaptain Tony Wilkinson, the Brian Clough of\nIC football said afterwards that he was not afraid\nof the Third team and that he thinks his team are\non the Motspur trail.\nTeam:\u2014 M. Heshmati, T. Wilkinson, D. Craig, R. Hunter, S. Parsons, R. 'Mills, K.( Geordie Soc) Gowan, S. Handa, M. Dhillon, I.Q. Haswell, B. Causey, Master Bates.\nFinally the Football Club still needs a few more\nplayers and especially referees (\u00a31.25 and a free\ntea). If you are interested put your name on the\nnotice board in the Union.\nPete Davies\n2nds RECOVER IC II 9 v QE C II 0\nOn a day when organisation hit an all time low,\nthe stout hearts that beat in the chests (or wher-ever) (boots perhaps\u2014Sports Ed.) of the men of\nIC soccer club combined to produce a resonant\nrhythm, the force of which left an uninspired QEC\nside heavily defeated and in awe. A personal\napology to Andy Roberts\u2014we didn't mean to bore\nyou quite so mu^h. The remaining team is beyond\ndescription. Felix has never encountered such\nsuperlatives.\nThe score, though high, was irrelevant, it was\nthe mystic combination of limbs and torsos, the\ntelepathic linking of 11 paranormal intellects,\nwhich made the opposition play not very well at\nall really. This sympathy of physical endeavour\nwas brought to a cataclysmic crescendo of a climax by the harmonic strains of tight-lipped,\nashen faced Alan Peterson's( captain, referee)\nwhistle. Alan Peterson is reputed to be 59.\nTeam: A. Peterson (76), A. Roberts (cardboard replica),\nR. Kill, R. Manning, R. Senkiw (kind permission of London Zoo), J. Iley (ditto), K. Alamouti, C. Higman (weight\nwatchers Ltd.), M. Clarke (Rent-a Thug Ltd.), R. Day\n(anonymous author\u2014Sports Ed.), I. Hyslop (co-author\u2014\nditto).\nAnom\nGOLF\nTHE READING AFFAIR With Hill's now quoting ICGS as the 5-4 on\nfavourites for the league\ntitle it is my pleasant\ntask to report the defeat\nof the mighty Reading\nteam, pre-season favourites for the title and containing some of the most\nforbidding names in\nmodern golf (I am forbidden to divulge their\nnames).\nThe society has only\nsuffered one defeat this\nseason and that at the\nhands of University College (4^-11) in the season Curtain-raise r. Reading subsequently defeated University College (6-0) so it was not\nsurprising that the press\ncolloquially referred our\nforthcoming encounter\nas a' piss over' for Reading. At the appointed\n'tee-off' time only their\nworst two players had\narrived, the rest choosing to arrive an hour\nlater complete with 'Go-Go Girls', press photographers, and sand-wi che s. Little did they\nknow what was in store\nfor them. Rain! Yes,\nglorious, gushing, form\nremoving rain, and lots\nof it. Naturally our\nmeteorological man Noel\nWilliams had forewarned\nthe committee of this\nand thus we had prepared by selecting an all-weather team for this\nencounter (or 'hands up\nwho's got an umbrella!)\nTheir tail-ender s were\nthe first to meet their\nWaterloo. John Mendonca, not overawed by his\npromotion, to the 'Elite'\nteam squad, strolled\nnonchalantly off to a cool five and four vic-tory, without ever needing to draw heavily on\nhis considerable putting\nability. Clearly John's name is one to watch!\nMike Strickland, now a seasoned campaigner,\nwas promoted to the no.\n2 spot due to the absence of 'Drover' Brown.\nHe adored a Victory.\n'Wild Bill' Calderwood unfortunately slid\nto a3 and 2 defeat. This\ndefeat is in no small way\nattributable to the fact\nthat he now putts one-handed with an umbrella\nover his head! Richard\nWiddilove, on a snooker\n'hot-streak' was in a hurry to get back to the\nfelt and consequently\nallowed his opponent to\nhustle him to a five and\nfour defeat!! Richard,\nhowever, got his own\nback at the snooker table\nafterwards. Nigel Foster\ndidn't really deserve to\nbeat his opponent by the\n5 and 3 margin that he\ndid (Mind you he had\nthe flu last week and\ndidn't deserve that ei th er). His opponent was\ngood and in truth would\nprobably have beaten\nhim in any subsequent\nmatch. However a touch\nof magic for four holes\ntied the match up and\nboth players Willingly\nbeat a wet retreat to the\nclubhouse. Clive Pemberton provided the only\nmassacre of the day. His\n6 and 5 victory over a talented opponent is apparently due to his dislike of rain (he loves\nsnow though).\nThus the society\npulled off a42 victory.\nUndoubtably this is our\nfinest result to date and\nrepresents a giant stride\ntowards our primary\ngoal, the coveted league\ntitle.\nNigel Foster (Capt.)\nTeam:\u2014 Nigel Foster\n(Capt), Bill Calderwood\n(V. Capt), Mike Strickland, Richard Waddilove, . Clive Pemberton,\nJohn Mendonca.\nRUGBY\nGut te ridge Cup2 nd round IC 22 WESTFIELD 3\nThe game was played in a strong wind with\nconstant rain at Harlington. Initially due to a number of dropped balls (and broken voices? Sports\nEd.) and indecisive defensive play, IC came under\na lot of unnecessary pressure. But superior forward power gave IC the lead through a push over\ntry hogged by ji crum 'half Chris Flanagan (guess\nwho wrote this\u2014Sports Ed.). Westfield shortly\nreplied with a penalty goal, awarded for Steve\nBooth handling in aru ck!!! From this point onwards Westfield were forced to defend vigorously.\nWhich they did with great success. Good backing\nup brought a try for Dave Osborne which drew a grudging conversion from Dave Rimmer (he didn't get any more). Next, Martin Cotter, trying to catch\nup in the try race, squeezed in two tries, despite\nhis knee. Then, to finish in style, Dennis (I 've got\nmore tries than you) Shakesheff, scored after a beautiful blind side break by the scrum half( Hen\nHeh!). Jeff Hughes won every tight ball but 3 in\nthe game. R. Hughes also played, R. Jones did not.\nHOCKEY\nl st XI Last Saturday the 1st XI travelled to Chalfont\nSt. Peters and played in a thoroughly enjoyable\nmatch in very picturesque surroundings. The team\nlost 2-1 but all decided that we had played well\nand that the result was a little unfair. However,\nthe performance of several players showed that\nthe potential of the team is still to be fully used.\nThe half-time score was 0-0 but after the restart\nChalfont scored two very qu fc k goals while the\ndefence sav our ed the juicy half-time oranges. IC\npulled one back through Pun and that was the\nfinal goal of the match.'\nOn Wednesday IC left for what used to be the\nbest drinking fixture of the season, Southampton\naway. We arrived in time for a quick couple of\npints of beer before the game. The game was\nplayed under very difficult conditions\u2014It was wet,\nwindy and they played better than us, and IC went\ndeservedly down 5-1.\nStill off the field IC shone and completely out-drank the opposition, most of whom had had\nenough by 7 o 'clock. We were content to stay all\nnight but Mick 'Sticky Tape' Downs decided that\nwe would leave at 11.30. At 11.30 a well drunk\nIC team left Southampton singing on its way back\nto IC.\nA. B.2nd XI The 2nd XI restarted the season in promising\nstyle last Saturday, by defeating Chinnor 2nd XI\n1-0. The fine weather and Arthur's good preparation of the pitch helped make it a very enjoyable\nmatch.\nIn the earlier stages IC dominated, but in spite\nof this shots for goal were far, and few between.\nI take heart, however, from the alert performance\nof the team, constructive use of the ball being\nmade 'in all sectors of the pitch. In the second half\nIC continued to take the upper hand, with the hard\nearned goal coming early on. More goals looked\npossible as a result of determined efforts on both\nwings stemming from sound built ups in mid-field.\nMany thanks to all members for their effort and\nI hope the more enjoyable game will inspire a more conscientious turn out this term.\nI. C.R. Late result:\u2014 2nd XI 3, Chalfont St. Peter\n2nd XI 1.\nX COUNTRY\nA week last Wednesday, I.C. descended on Brighton to\nrace against Sussex University and Brighton Poly. Thames\nPoly were also supposed to be running, but arrived late\n(minus gimp). The race marked lan's comeback, but all\nhopes of a good run were dashed on the first bend, when\nthe aforesaid runner went arse over tit. There then followed\na slight clash with the Law, starting with a few well\nknown Union Bar songs in the street and finishing with a Uri\nGeller act on a station clock, in between, Pete Johnson\nwas saved from a fate worse than death and Keith failed\nto nick a plastic cannon from \"The Bosun\".\nThe turnout for the U.C.'5' on Saturday was piss-poor,\nwith Pad in the first team at one stage. However, Granny\nplugged his brain into his pocket computer, and thus re-vitali sed managed to follow Rob in as 2n dI.C. counter.\nLast Wednesday we beat (say no more) London Hospitals and Sussex at Petersham, with Rob managing a personal best, but the team ch under expert failed to perform.\nLater that evening, it was revealed that we had been harbouring an under-age drinker, but at least the Natural\nHistory Museum gained from it.

We already have Felix\nand STOIC IC-Wide; for a start Felix\nonly comes out fortnightly and any\nnews in it <is no longer news.\nUntil recently it has not lived up to\nits definition as a college newspaper,\ncatering for the views of most students at IC. On the other hand STOIC\nis limited in what it can do; mainly\ndue to its dependence on College\nowned equipment, and the co-opera-tion of College employed personnel,\nwho understandably, are unwilling to\ngive up too much of their spare time.\nAdded to which STOIC cannot expand\nmuch more than it has done already,\nin terms of quality, versatility and\nair time. Even pouring more money\ninto STOIC and/or Felix will not improve the overall quality of either's output.\nPROGRAMMES\nImperial College Radio can provide\na much better media service to students at IC. IC Radio can broadcast\na more up to date and comprehensive\nnews service plus a better sports results service, than either Felix or\nSTOIC are capable of doing. To\nwatch STOIC you must go to the\nTVs around, whereas ICR o an be\nlistened to in your own room, on your\nown 'tr annie '\u2014listen to it without 'in-ter rup ting your academic work. We propose a radio station broadcasting\nto students in hall and house, at\nweekends and week day evenings,\nwhen you are not searching around for\nyour mid-day meal. It would transmit\non medium wave around 300 metres\n(Which most radios o an receive). ICR\ncould on a regular basis cover a much\nwider spectrum than either Felix or\nSTOIC; for example it could include\nregular programmes from Jazz Club,\nFolk Club, IC Ents, IOWA, Electronic\nmusic group, IC Musical society,\nDramsoc, and many other such clubs.\nWe would also like to start up a weekly inter-hall or house com pet i tion, on the lines of a comic quiz programme\u2014'This week it's Lin stead\nversus Weeks on how to run a successful bar'. 'What'sOn', request\ngram mes and student music programmes would complete our 'provisional prospectus.\nSERVICE\nWhat about Capitol and 247, o an we compete With them? 247 only provides a reasonable service for students between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight. Six days a week; Capitol does not provide a student service\non Sunday (all day) and after 8.30\np.m. on weekdays. We would start up\nthe station, broadcasting at 12 noon\ntill 12 midnight Sundays, and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and\nSaturdays With specialist music programmes to start with. We would be\nable to get all the new releases (as do\nthe other radio Stations) from the\nrecord companies \u2014 consequently\nwe could provide a record review ser-vice.\nCOST\nThe initial cost is estimated to be\n\u00a31,500 With running oost s of around\n\u00a3400 per annum (Nfi Felix costs\n\u00a32,000 per annum just to run). It has\nbeen noted that College might be\nprepared to pay some part of (this,\nthus offsetting the initial costs. There\nis a questionnaire due this week to\nfind out the views of the average student in hall and house, upon this sub-j ect. Initial response from various\npeople has been favourable, but we\nwould like to obtain a more representative view before putting our case to\nCouncil or aUG M.As ever, if you want to play a part\nin the radio station come and see us\npersonally.

Figures show\nthat during a certain per-io d,147 different dishes\nwere offered at 1 / 7 d as\nopposed to 87 at 1/9d and 40 at 2 / 0 and\nabove. The misconception has arisen from attempts to introduce a wider choice of dishes,\nan effort which should be\nwelcomed by all using\nthis refectory.\nSUICIDES\nlit has been very\nnoticeable in the last few\nyears that the number of\nsuicidal attempts by students of Oxford, Cambridge, London and other\nof the larger Universities, is increasing at an\nalarming rate.\nICWA BOAT CLUB\nThe formation of a women's boat club has\nrecently been discussed\nThe need for more\nwomen at IC is clear,\nsince at least two dozen\nactive members and a coach would be necessary to produce two racing crews.\nICWA must realise,\nhowever, that it is unreasonable to expect the\ncons ider ab 'le a Ite rat i on s to the boat ho 'use necessary to cater for a handful of their members\nWho might mot row regularly after all.

The idea of staggering lecture times near\nthe lunch hour was proposed and, while this\nmight well ease the situation on three days a week, during the long\nGeneral Studies lunch-hour, this Will have no\neffect. Mr. Mooney proposes to cut down the\nchoice of dishes, with a view to speeding up the\nservice\u2014a rather unfortunate method, but if it\nworks, perhaps some\npeople may think it\nworth it.\nFEBRUARY 12, 1964\n200th EDITION\nRAID\nLast week 70 Regent\nStreet Poly students battled with attendants and\nwere thrown out, when\nthey tried to raid the\nFestival Hall.

The President\nwas heard to say \"it's a shambles\" When he left\nthe meeting, but it's really his job to prevent\na shambles. Perhaps if\nhe controlled council\nmeetings as he did last\nterm more would be\nachieved.\nFEBRUARY 6, 1969\nLSE\nAt an emergency\nmeeting of the City and\nGuilds last Friday, a motion was passed expressing disapproval of\nthe recent action of certain LSE students at\nULU. 650 students attended the meeting and\nthere were several members of the national press\nalso present. He asked\nGuilds to make it known\nthat IC is no hot-bed of\nrevolutionary fer v our and that militant students will have no support here. \" We must\nmake it crystal clear that\nwe are warning off Tariq\nAli and rent-a mob\", he\nsaid. The motion was\ncarried by 579 Votes for,\n50 against, with 21 ab-stent ions. U GM Once again, in quo racy caused the last IC Union\nmeeting to close early,\nafter only two motions\nhad been proposed. A motion proposing that\nwomen should be allowed in the Union bar was\ndefeated. The second\nreferred to the donation\nof \u00a3 2 5 to a certain\nCharity. This was also\ndefeated. A motion referring to the plight of\nSoviet Jewry was greeted by a mass exodus\nfrom the hall, and the\ncalling of the quorum\nwas left as a formality.\nI.C.
