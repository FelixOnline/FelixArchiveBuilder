    "content": "FeliX FELIX\nThis FELIX is a little thin at 16 pages, since most of\nthe FELIX staff are revising or taking exams at the\nmoment. I cannot see us rising above 16 pages for\nseveral weeks. I do hope to produce a bumper final\nFELIX for June 22, however. If you have any ideas\nfor features etc. please pop into the office. Work has\nalready started in preparation for the monster. In the\nmeantime, if you are at a loose end on a Thursday\nevening, please come along to the FELIX Office to help\ncollate.\nManagement and Planning Group and Network\nI do not wish to comment upon a great deal of this\nweek's news. Instead I should like to talk about a College Committee which is taking on an increasing\nrole in the running of IC. The Management and\nPlanning Group is a committee chaired by the Rector\nand attended by the College's Deans, the Managing\nDirector and the Business Manager. It is sadly lacking\nin one vital area: student representation. This year the\ncommittee has made decisions on the careers centre\nat IC. The centre provides a valuable service to\nstudents, who now have no say in its future.\nI accept that the college has to make cut-backs. The\nproblem seems to be that student services are the\ntarget for savings. I could mention a number of\nwasteful and costly exercises within IC, which serve\nneither the students nor the staff of the college\u2014\nwhere are the cuts here? One big area of monetary\nwaste age is the exercise in internal public relations,\nknown as Network. Network is a 'magazine' which\nspreads the good word according to 'The College.' It\nis distributed to staff and contains 'news' on how\nwonderful Imperial College is, as well as\nadvertisements for the HUB Office's events and\nHumanities Lectures. The editor is Eric Stables, Head\nof the Humanities Department (with special\nresponsibilities for nepotism it seems.I As a vehicle for making staff aware of what is\nhappening within the College Network fails abysmally.\nAs a method of burning tens of thousands of pounds\na year, it succeeds admirably. Why is it that a publication, which clearly makes no attempt\nwhatsoever to attract advertising receives money,\nwhilst a facility like the careers service, which raises\nmoney from industry has funds taken away from it?\nI believe that the Management and Planning Group\nis a body formed to further the wishes of academics\nand the college's administration, whilst ignoring the\nneeds of the students. The students' union should\npress for representation upon it before the situation\nbecomes irretrievable. I cannot see it being too long\nbefore the hall rents are set by this body. Already the\nstudents have no say in the rent levels, since the\ncommittee which used to set them, with student\nadvice, has had its powers neutered in this area. Rents\nare rising, student benefits have gone and students\nare seeing harsher cuts in the areas that affect them.\nI do not believe this college has any further wish to\neducate undergraduates. If it does, it's got a pretty\nshit way of showing it. Arise Sir Eric, Knight of\nCheapskate Industrial Estate..\nCompetition\nThe results to the STA Travel and Jesus Jones\ncompetitions will be announced in next week's issue.\nGive Blood\nCity and Guilds Union\nwill be holding a blood\ndonor session in Southside\nGym on\nMay8 th Anybody wishing to give\nblood should contact the\nGuilds office as soon as\npossible\nCredits\nMany thanks to last week's colla tors: Dominic and\nGraham from Ents, Jeremy Burnell, Tom Yates and\nJim Lucy.

    "content": "The World's Great Tube Journeys.\nBalham to Morden\nAs an admirer of the London Underground System for\nmany years, I have decided to start a regular column\nof my journeys on this historical and fascinating form\nof transport. Summer is a time for travel and\nexcitement. Last weekend, I set forth upon an\nadventure of the highest peril, Balham to Morden.\nFor just \u00a32.601 was able to foray forth through the\ndeepest depths of this great capital's suburbia and\nenjoy the hands-on experience of Morden. But first,\nmy preparations.\nEquipped with my ca goule for the tropical rain\nstorms so often encountered in outer London,\naccording to leading authorities, I checked off my\nessentials for survival on the Northern Line. This is\nprobably a good point at which to make some brief\nobservations about safety and survival. If you expect\nto be out for more than three hours on the 'tube' (as\nwe Londoners call it), make sure you pack abi vi bag\nfor those long waits on the Northern line platforms.\nIf you have a problem with your eyesight (as I and\nmany of my friends have) then pack a good set of\nbinoculars to read the information signs. Watch out\nfor those all important messages cone r ning bodies\nunder trains and late trains due to delays on the line.\nIf you do have the rare privilege of sighting one of the\naforementioned, be sure to bi vi down with your\npersonal hi fi. Be sure to pack a bottle of Clearasil for\nthose longer days.\nHaving dispensed with safety checks and the\npacking of my survival gear, I set out Balham-bound.\nAh Balham! Packed with atmosphere and a truly\ninternational flavour it sums up all that is 'great' in\nGreater London. I purchased my 'Capital Card' with\npride. Capital it is too! Such value! A whole day's travel through 'the smoke' for so little. With my\nsparkling prize at the ready, I ventured forth to test\nthe new barriers. Lorks and lu mme! My first adversary\nin the battle of Balham. I was so glad of my first day's contact with those great people from our prestigious\nrailway service as I found my card jammed in the\nmachine. After an enlightening conversation about\nreproduction and why I could not have a refund I was\nglad to buy a new ticket, safe in the knowledge that\nthe authorities would return my money if they found\nthe offending ticket. Light of heart and sturdy of foot\nI embarked upon my escapade. 'Morden, here I come,'\nI thought!!\nLife upon the Northern Line has Hispanic roots. As\nafternoon approaches, all life becomes one long\nsiesta, the local flamenco dancing platform attendants\nlie down to rest and the station starts to resemble a small village in the Isle of Wight. The Isle of Wight,\nwhere I met Brenda, for whom my personal hi fi will\nalways be the only lasting memory. A boon to\ntravellers on the open track, my personal hi fi has three\nbuttons on it. One for play, one for fast forward and\none for stopping. Some of my friends say I never know\nwhen to stop, so I have broken the stop button. Sadly,\nthe play button was also a casualty in this exploit.\nNow I am forced to hold the button down. Life has\nits compensations, I now find I waste far fewer\nbatteries when falling asleep in my bi vi upon the\nplatform.\nSettling down to a quiet relaxing wait I unpacked\nthe paraffin stove I always pack for these occasions\nand made ready for a fresh cup of tea. 'Glorious\nBalham!' I thought. Beautiful restful Balham. When I die, I want to be buried in Balham, a place for tranquil\nrest and a nice cup of tea, which is always useful at\na funeral, after all. Tea is one of the major exports of\nPage 12\nBalham, in fact. Few people are privy to the secret\nbut succesful Balham Tea Syndicate, which meets\nevery other Tuesday in the local village hall.\nAfter a restful sleep, I made my first attempt at\nboarding the Northern line locomotive number G163,\na new number to me, which I subsequently realised\nwas the last of a fleet exported to the Isle of Wight.\nAs I viewed the engine with pride I realised my folly,\nfor the doors were closing. Oh great woe! I had missed\nthe train. I settled down to brew up once more. I read\nthe exciting advertisements about the girl who uses\ntemp agencies for jobs every day not every day jobs.\nWhat wit and humour is contained within such puns\nas FantastiKelly! Entertainment is never far away on\nthe Northern Line. Further down the platform lies a poster for a dating agency, full of very attractive\npeople, who I have always wanted to meet.\nDating agencies. I have always wondered what sort\nof person uses an agency for arranging their\nrelationships. You get a lot of time to wonder on the\nNorthern Line. I am still wondering if I am the sort of\nperson who joins dating agencies. I'm sure they have\nroom for somebody with a startling range of\nknowledge of Britain's railway network like mine.\nThere must be women swooning at the mere sight of\na blue ca goule, let alone a462 diesel at top speed on\nthe London to Glasgow line. It's not what you wear,\nit's how you wear it. My ca goule can be quite fetching\nin an off-the-shoulder style, according to my mum\n(and she should know).\nThe ca goule, of course was invented by a French\nman called Mr Cagoule. Mr Cagoule, or 'Cag,' as his\nfriends were known to call him, had been a pioneering\nexplorer of the deserts for many years when he\nrealised that a large part of the water he lost in the\ndesert was due to sweating. To save himself the effort\nof carrying an excessive amount of water around the\ndesert, he invented an item capable of collecting the\nwearer's sweat for recycling. After many years' use\nin the desert, Mr Cagoule finally discovered a commercial use for the ca goule, during a freak rain\nstorm in the Sahara. As well as keeping the sweat in,\nit actually protected the wearer from the rain. As a truly inventive and original designer, Mr Cagoule\ndecided to patent the coat then and there, and to call\nit the 'Cagoule.' (It should be noted that Mr Cagoule's original coat was blue.)\nAs the sun began to rise in the sky, I felt my first\nhunger pangs calling me to unpack that Pot Noodle\nand get stuck in. I could stand it no longer. I had saved\nthis delicacy all morning. As I waited for the water\nto boil, with trembling hands and nervous breath I read\nthe enticing tub. Sweet and Sour Soya Chicken\nflavour pieces with noodles. Who needs meat, when\nthe luxury of soya can be yours for as little as 79p? As the tub filled and my taste buds tingled, I heard a distant but somehow familiar sound. The train!\nI hurriedly pushed my utensils into my bag and made\nready to board, Pot noodle in one hand and capital\ncard in the other. The doors opened, and I was on.\nMorden-bound! My heart rose and I struggled for my\ncamera to get a good shot of the scenery. Pictured\nhere is the tunnel between Balham and Tooting Bee.\nThe shot was taken with a50 mm lens at f8 and a2 second exposure. As a keen photographer, I knew I had the shot 'in the bag,' as we say in the trade. I'm rather proud of it and I have decided to name it 'Tunnel\nbetween Balham and Tooting Bee' Rather a fitting\ntitle, don't you think? I'm no Simon Bailey, but I know\na fair bit when it comes to cameras.\nSpeeding along the track I was able to see scenes\nof the indigenous wildlife, as it sauntered across the\ntracks to avoid the train. The rats and other rodents\non the Northern Line have become sedate in their\noutlook on life, taking on the relaxed air of their natural\nhabitat. The Northern Line embodies peace and\ntranquility in a way that no other railway service\nseems able to match.\nTooting Bee. A place with a fascinating history,\nconnected with a now extinct form of British wildlife.\nTooting Bee was originally known as Sugdenton. It\nhad a huge population of creatures with three legs,\ntwo bottoms and no mouth. The 'Bees' as they were\nknown seemed to serve little purpose in life. They\nwould spend most of the day passing wind through\nclenched buttocks to create a 'tooting' noise. After\nthe death of the 'bees' during the creation of the\nglorious Northern Line, this station was named in their\nhonour. The next station, Tooting Broadway, was\nonce a large area of land upon which the 'bees' would\ngather on a Sunday in order to 'toot.' Onwards to\nTooting Broadway!\nTooting Broadway is a fascinating place to visit. I know, because I had the pleasure of spending eight\nhours there this particular day. The train terminated\nand I dutifully disembarked, searching with an eager\ntraveller's eye for the 'Nothing to declare' queue near\nthe exit to 'Cosmopolitan Greater London.' It was then\nthat I spotted the vivid paintwork upon this station.\nPurple, beautifully and tastefully matched with purple.\nHow could they have known! My favourite\ncombination of colours! The paintwork was finished\nin a tough gloss paint. Subsequent information from\nthe platform attendant allows me to impart even more\nabout this fascinating facet of the decorating industry.\nThe constraint of space is sadly against me this week,\nhowever I failed to complete my trip to Morden on this\nparticular day, but rest assured, I shall return for\nanother attempt upon the summit of Morden. Happy\nSpotting!\nSimbard O 'Shawn.\n\n"

Money\nspinner\nFollowing the recent sale of the car registration\nnumber ' FELIX' by the District vehicle licensing\ncentre (DVLC) at \u00a345,150, it has been decided that\nas from next term the title page of this newspaper will\nbe sold to the highest bidder.\nBids are expected to overshoot this value by\n\u00a3100,000 reflecting the grandeur yet subtlety in the\nscope of the post-modernist/pseudo-Braquesque\nfunctionality of design displayed on these pages.\nBook keeping\nImperial College Union (ICU) and the Constituent\nCollege Unions will not obtain a dividend from the\nUnion bookstore for another two to three years,\naccording to Dave Williams, Deputy President of\nICU. This is despite a profit of about \u00a336,000 between\nAugust and January this year. The Bookstore has to\nrepay ICU \u00a336,000 which the Union invested in it\nfor refurbishment, as well as the cost of a loan.\nBlood\ntransfusion\nThe next mass blood transfusion will take place in\nSouthside Gym on May 8th. Anybody can sign up\nat the City and Guilds Union (C& GU) office or in\nthe Junior Common Room on May 1st. Chris Home, president of the C& GU, said that\nthere had been 130 donors last time, and all these\ndonors would be welcome again. He said that the\ntransfusion should take half an hour for each person.\nThe Natural History Museum is holding a tour of its\nBotany department on the 10th and 17th May as a part of a series of botanical events. Museum scientists\nwill give a guided tour of its large plant specimen\ncollection. Anybody interested must meet at the\nInformation desk at 2.00pm on the day. Enquiries on\n938 8846.\nBorrowed\ntime\nThe student loans proposal has received Royal Assent\nand is now law. From next September the student\ngrant level will receive its final increase, and each\nstudent will be given access to a loan of \u00a3420 a year.\nThis will be repayable in line with inflation when the\nstudent earns 85% of the national average. Grant\nlevels will be frozen soon afterwards. Students will\nno longer be entitled to housing benefit by law.\nThe government has not said if there will be added\nassistance for students living areas with a high cost\nof living.\nIC Party\npooper\nThe Imperial College Party has 'a slim chance'\naccording to ICP co-or d in at or Tom Yates. By 8.30\non Thurday (yesterday) he estimated that 1100 of the\n2900 eligible voters in the Knightsbridge ward of\nWestminster had voted, 35 % of which were students.\nHe said that since not all students had voted, the ICP\nnow depended on outsiders to vote for them.\nNo figures were available for the Courtfield ward\nin Kensington and Chelsea, though as there are very\nfew students in this ward success is unlikely.\nSex war\nMr Ross Curds, has been elected as Women's officer\nat University College London Union. As the first male\nWomen's Officer, he will not be allowed into the NUS\nwomen's conference and, will not be able to use\nwomen's facilities. There appear to be few complaints\nthat he is unrepresentative of women at the college.\nPhotograph\ntalk\nSt. Mary's photography society has invited Bob\nBodman, pictures editor of the Daily Telegraph, to\nspeak on press photography. The talk will be held\nin the TV room in the basement of the Medical School\non Thursday 10th at 7.30pm. Nursery\nnews\nThe college nursery has seen a few improvements in\nthe last few weeks. The College has fitted a new exit\nand the fire extinguishers have been updated.\nSue Thornett, Nurse in Charge of the nursery, said\nthat parents had formed a group to lobby\nadministration, particularly Peter Hallworth, Manager\nof Residences. She said that the nursery always had\nmore staff than required and it had always 'complied\nwith all the regulations.'\n'We would like to have better surroundings but\nsomebody has to pay for it', she said. She expressed\nregret that some parents of the children had decided\nto take on the college without understanding that the\ncollege could not legally help the nursery in financial\nmatters.\nShe added that the nursery conditions were 'still\nnot very good by today's standards'.\nCareers\nservice\nThe Management Planning Group of IC (MPG) has\ndecided to keep the post of Information Officer at the\nCareers Advisory Service (CAS).\nIt has lost the post of Vacation Training Coordinator, and the still vacant post of Information\nOfficer will be upgraded and become a full time job.\nThe CAS will have to use postgraduate* students to\nmaintain its services.\nDr Russ Clark, College Careers Officer said that\nat the moment there were about 30 students a day\nmaking enquiries at the office, which the service could\ncope with 'though the lunchtimes are a little difficult'.\nHe said that towards the end of the term it might get\nworse.\nHe explained that the present situation was a compromise, 'We are not entirely happy with the\nsituation but we'll have to live with it,' he said.\n\n"

    "content": "Sab Fashions\nBy Edna Welthorpe.\nWelcome back darlings to Edna's come-and-eat-me-up style fashion piece... Bad news this week I'm afraid\nas we see our own very favourite new election fashion\nhipster Jessica Rabbit usurped by sexist trash-monger er Ben Turner. Or should we say Ben TurnUP.\nBecause you see darlings, every pair of trousers\nBenjamin sports have those oh-so-eighties turn-ups.\nIt's true! This could be for two reasons: (i) it's a discrete place to stash an eigth of cannabis resin or\n(ii) because his legs are too short. We rather suspect\nthe latter, because small men always indulge in sexist\ninnuendo don't they darlings?\nBenjamin obviously tries to identify with the NextMan neo-classical look implying that he is a man of\ncul fur e with a love for the environment too. The\necologically gelled hair, pre n ten tio us polo-neck and\nskin-tight black jeans suggesting rippling athletic\nmuscles should attract today's post-fem in in st ideal\nwoman-a liberated user of ecology minded 'mum'.\nBut enough of the oh so dull victor. The spoils of\nfashion, fall to the gallant losers\u2014I.C.'s very own\nTurner and Hooch. Spencer Lane with his Carnaby\nStreet hat and his seedy old man's raincoat-where\ndid he get those stains? And Graeme Littler as lovable\nHooch who has even managed to get into a Marks and\nSpencer suit in the picture.\nSo luv vies, was fashion the real winner of the D.P. election with Benjamins grossly offensive sexual\nstyle? Well no, because being a liberated lesbian I found the Just Seventeen girl running for new election\nfar more stylistically t it i latin g than all the others\nlumped togther. We can only hope that Benjamin, with\nhis new source of income, will throw away his entire\nwardrobe and make a clean breast of his fashions for\nnext year!\nThe Delator\nColumn\nBy Carolyne Toynbee\nThe hot weather has made people do the most curious\nthings lately. Take Union Publications Board Chairman\nDoug King, for example. Mr King has clearly been\nshowing a lot of sympathy with the many people he\nknows incarcerated in Strangeways. Keen to show\nsolidarity with the inmates, Doug held his own rooftop\nprotest in the Union building last week. Onto the roof\nwalked Mr Nicholas Marley, the current bed pal of\nICU's very own Hon Sec. What did Mr Marley see\nbefore his innocent uncorrupted eyes? The pink bum\nof Doug King gyrating up and down on top of a Maths\n1st year who shall remain nameless (Laurie\nMcNamee). Quick as a flash, Mr Marley hurried down\nto the Union office and instructed Deputy President\nDave Williams to fetch his camera. True to form, Mr\nWilliams was too slow and so proof of the carnal act\ncannot be reproduced here.\nUnion Bar Manager Jelly Johnson has just returned\nfrom a fact-finding tour of the States. His mission was\nto seek out as many bars as possible in order to find\nways of improving the turnover of the Union Bar. On\nencountering customs at Heathrow on the return leg\nof his trip, he was stopped by officials of HM Customs\nand Excise demanding he pay duty on some items in\nhis baggage. The items in question were a couple of\nsize 44DD brassieres. Mr Johnson staunchly denied\nthat they were for his own personal and perverted use\nclaiming that they were 'presents'. FELIX wish to\nspeak to a20 stone woman with four breasts to verify\nthis.\nFollowing his victory in the Deputy Presidential\nelection on Tuesday night, Ben Turner celebrated\nwith, amongst others, Union Manager David Peacock.\nThe booze was flowing so freely that Mr Turner's bar\ntab had reached \u00a3 110 by the end of the evening. Mr\nPeacock, who had clearly attempted to drink all \u00a3110\nsingle-handed was a bit the worst for wear and ended\nup on the DP-elect's floor that night. The next\nmorning, Ben offered to splash out more of his cash\nby taking Peaky out for a slap-up breakfast.\n'Everything in the house for my new friend Dave',\ncried Mr Turner, 'Money no object'. After much\nmasticating, the bill arrived. Alas, Ben's coffers had\nrun dry. Off he trundled to the cashpoint. Sadly, this\ntoo rejected Mr Turner's plea for cash. Mr Peacock\nended up settling out of his own pocket. Not the way\nto treat your new employee, Ben.\nIn the same crowd, was the em baras sing Irish drunk\nof the evening, ICU President elect, Paul Shanley. Mr\nShanley started his road to stardom by hailing across\nthe bar to a somewhat camp individual in orange.\nHaving clearly heard of Mr Shanley, the gentleman\nignored him. After several minutes of shouting across\nthe bar, Mr Shanley resorted to standing upon a table\nand hollering across the bar before crawling over to\nthe orange clad stranger. After a brief conversation\nhe dragged the gentleman over to Union Snack Bar\nManager, Ian Richards and introduced the gentleman\nas 'Dougal,' to fits of (his own) laughter. Mr Shanley\nwas later seen being taken away to shouts of 'I think\nyou've had enough Paul.'\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "Felix rock-jour no, Stone, looks at the new 12 \" single, Staring at the Sun, and LP Joy 1967-1990\nafter a gig at the Borderline Club last Saturday by...\nUltra Vivid Scene\nUltra Vivid Scene, the New York based band led by\nand largely composed of Kurt Ralske have just\nreleased their first material in a year, a single Staring\nat the Sun and their second LP, Joy 1967-1990. As\nwell as this they have just started their first UK tour,\nstarting with three sold-out dates at the Borderline\nClub.\nRalske has moved away from his penchant for\nthings sado-masochistic and written songs of a happier timbre, as the title 'Joy' indicates. Staring at\nthe Sun is almost ident ik it indie pop, with guitar\ndoodling over a simple one-two drum pattern creating\na tangle of hook-lines that combine to give an\nirresistible sum. The UVS hall-mark of slightly country-tinged guitar effects persists, although incorporated\ninto an entirely different overall sound. Crash, a re-recording of the first UVS LP, is a repetitive chime of\nsynth and twang set off by the extraordinary languid\nquality of Ralske's vocals. The single is backed with\nThree Stars, extended on the 12\"/CD which sounds\noddly like thrash metal at a quarter the speed. The\nsingle closes with a cover,of Something Better which\nfades away delicately.\nThe LP, Joy opens with the warbling but heavily\nlaid-back It Happens Every Time before breaking into\nfull flow with Staring and the schizophrenic 7\" version\nof Three Stars. The fourth track, Special One features\nKim Deal of the Pixies on backing vocal and the song\nitself is like the Pixies in a gentle frame of mind, plus\nwhat appears to be a Hammon organ bubbling in the\nbackground.\nGrey Turns White jangles mes m eric ally into the\ngrinding, slyly twisted Poison. Ralske sings with dark\nthreat in his voice, rather startling after the tranquil\nundertow of the rest of the A side Guilty Pleasure\nstarts the flip side with a sound that comes straight\nout of Sunday morning via severe vibrato and then the\npace ebbs still more into Extra Ordinary which is an\nalmost disappointing ballad, saved only by the vocals.\nBeauty No. 2 starts out as a flowing montage of\nsustained notes and then gradually transforms into\nlittle swatches of overlay ed guitar. The Kindest Cut\nis a sadly obsessive song with a melancholy cello;\nPraise The Low is folk y and martial in its structure but\nnot its execution. Lightning builds up to a peaceful but\nhardly stagnant close.\nRalske seems to have avoided the problems so\nmany artists have with the second album, shifting his\noutlook to a less bizarre theme without losing his gift\nfor writing good pop songs (he claims to have already\nwritten 900 songs). Having proved his skill at the\nrecorded level he only needed to prove he could do\nit live. During a21 night support to Ian McCulloch in\nthe States he found he was not only good at it but\nenjoyed it immensely as well. Playing live made it\nimpossible to single-handedly play all the instruments\nso UVS expanded to a four-piece for their first UK\ndates.\nThe Borderline, a very small venue (especially for\nsuch a large band), gave the gig an intimate\natmosphere perfect for the band. Ralske took the tiny\nstage besieged by his fans (most of whom at the front\ncould do no more than wave feebly) and played a set\nsimultaneously too short (only ten or so three minute\nsongs) and too long (for those of us pressed into the\nwoodwork). Little of the new album emerged, the set\nlist being made up from the singles and B sides; She\nScreamed frantic and Staring manic. Three Stars\npulped the crowd and Codine gave us a thankful\nrespite. The encore was the mighty (and as yet\nunsurpassed) Mercy Seat.\nJoy 1967-1990 is released on May 8 and the first\n10,000 copies contain agate fold insert. UVS play the\nTown and Country Club on May 30.\nApologies and thanks to joy. See you in 2067.\nStone.\nPage 5\n\n"

If you are interested, sign up in the\nUnion Office, or come to a Rag meeting (12.40pm, Friday) for sponsorship forms.\nHomosexuality\u2014is the\nstereotype true?\nMost people, including students, often have a negative view of homosexuality. Yet if you were to\nassume that there is little or no gay element at IC you\nwould be very wrong. Based on the national statistic\nof 10%, at least 500 people in the College are gay.\nThe overwhelming majority however are unable to be\nopen about it largely due to the reaction it can\nprovoke. Yet if it were known, their friends and others\naround them would nearly always be surprised for the\nsimple reason they do not act the way they are\nsupposed to.\nTo raise such an issue you might suspect, and you\nwould be right, in the assumption that I am gay. With\nthis fact in mind what am I like as a person? The\nstereotyped view is well known and unfortunately\nwell believed. Such a view would have you believe\nthat I( and other gay people) are a threat to children\nand men in general and that we hate women but\ndesire to be like one. Alternatively we might be\nperceived as just 'harmless old queers'! The reality\n(surprise, surprise) is somewhat different. I am not\ncamp, neither do I hate women (in fact I have a great\ndeal of respect for them) yet I do not desire to be one.\nNeither am I a threat to children nor fellow students.\nNobody has anything to fear from me. What is more,\nI am relieved to say, I am just another extremely\nordinary person. I am not alone in that fact either.\nThere are, of course, a number of 'colourful\neccentrics' around but these are not representative\neven though nobody should fear them. Virtually every\ngay person I have met has been an 'ordinary guy' and\nI am sure that is true of the majority of gay people.\nIf this is so why then is there so much resentment\nfrom the 'straight' community directed towards gays?\nThere are of course religious objections; 'practicing\nhomosexuality is a sin'! I am not a religious person yet\nI respect the views of those who are. But I can think\nof many 'sins' which are far worse than two men who\ncare about each other expressing that love.\nIn Family Matters (BBC1,4.4.90) the story was told\nof one young gay man who killed himself because his\nreligion objected to it. The fact that he was forced to\ndo this disgusts me; his father said after his son's death that it was better his son had died and was\n'with God' than for him to be alive and gay. Such\nviews are hypocrisy of religious belief and surely\ninvalidate any religious argument. Hopefully other\nreligious people are as tolerant as their faith decrees.\nI think however that most objections stem from the\nfact that little is known about the realities of\nhomosexuality, especially when what little\ninformation known is based on a few sordid\noccur en ces and gross generalisations. I wouldn't even\nwant to preach that all gays are warm wonderful\nhuman beings because that certainly isn't true. Just\nlike society as a whole, the gay community consists\nof a wide variety of people and just like society as a whole most are OK. There are though 'bad elements'\nsuch as gay molesters, rapists, prostitutes etc but just\nlike such people in straight society they are NOT\nrepresentative. I too am disgusted by such people but\nwhat equally disgusts me is that their highly distorted\nview of homo sex uli ty is the one highlighted most\noften and to the detriment of others. Media such as\nThe Sun ate full of scandalous tales of 'raving\npoof ter s' and 'loony lefties brainwashing kids to be\ngay' and I have to say that if that was my only\ninformation about homosexuality even I would\nprobably be homophobic! I can therefore understand\nwhy many people feel uneasy about gays. But I say\nto those people again: your views are based on\nunrepresentative, misleading information. You could\neven say that you have been conned by the media.\nAfter all they are there to sell newspapers and not to\ngive you a fair assessment of ordinary people, gay or\nstraight.\nHomosexuality is not a sin, nor a mental illness. It's about people who, for unexplained reasons, feel that\nthey will be happiest and most relaxed with people\nof the same sex as themselves. They are, on the\nwhole, ordinary people just like everybody else, who\ndon't want to 'take over the world' but just be happy\nin their lives and relationships, just like everybody else.\nIs that really too much to ask for?\nName withheld by request.\nPage 13\n\n"

    "content": "Mac right? Well done 2 No benefit given\nDear Dave,\nIn last week's FELIX, issue 866, the presidents of\nthe three CCUs replied to a letter by Mr Holmes, which\ncaused me a great deal of concern. Granted they may\nnot have agreed with Mr Holmes' views regarding\nCCUs, but they have totally missed the point of the\nletter and shown a very immature attitude by resorting\nto a blatant personal attack on Mr Holmes. What I also\nfind distressing is that they also see fit to attack the\nMechanical Engineering Society, a society which,\nmany others have given a great deal of time and effort\nin supporting, including Mr Holmes.\nAdmittedly, Mech Eng Soc has not been as active\nthis year as it has previously, but this is not Mr\nHolmes' fault, as suggested by Mr Home and\ncompany. Mech Eng Soc organised the department\nChristmas party as usual, and was also approached\nby the 'group of students who were not aware of the\nexistence of Mech Eng Soc' to help organise the\nRevue and to sell tickets for said Revue. That's quite\na feat if they didn't know Mech Eng Soc existed!\nFurther to the accusation of 'no events' must come\nthe question of the Great Egg Race, an event hijacked\nfrom Mech Eng Soc by C&G this year. This proved to\nbe the straw that broke the camel's back as far as\nMech Eng Soc was concerned, especially as C&G made no attempt at using any imagination in this\nyear's Egg Race, and copied the previous two year's design briefs. It was also interesting to note that far\nfewer people attended this year's 'Interdepartmental\nSpectacular' than Mech Eng Soc had attracted\npreviously to the single department event.\nI assume that the glasshouse and stone throwing\ncomment was meant to imply that Mr Holmes had\ntaken up the chair of Mech Eng Soc for CV points.\nIf this is so, then maybe Mr Home and company\nshould check their information before casting\naspersions. Mr Holmes took the chair, not as a means\nof gaining CV points, but because no one else was\ntoo keen to take the post, due to the difficulties it was\nknown would appear, especially given the hijacking\nof our major event. Perhaps Mr Home should converse\nwith last year's chairperson, whom I believe is a friend\nof his, to ascertain the truth. Perhaps this would leave\nhim with no ammunition for the attack he has made\non Mr Holmes.\nAs I mentioned, I believe that the whole point of Mr\nHolmes' letter was missed by Mr Home and co. Mr\nHolmes was questioning the \u00a3 8 0 0 0 + expenditure on\ncomputing equipment for CCU offices. City & Guilds\nare now the owners of three Apple Macintosh\ncomputers and a Laser Printer. Unless I am much\nmistaken, Union business can surely not tie up three\nMacs simultaneously, or is it just that they are\nconvenient for report writing? This is what Mr Holmes\nwas getting at, a point which has been totally ignored\nin a childish personal attack by the CCU presidents.\nPerhaps Mr Home and company should get their\ninformation correct before they proceed to throw\nstones from their greenhouses.\nYours sincerely,\nS Burton, 3M. Well done 1\nDear Dave,\nThe Poll Tax is totally fair. My wife and I have saved\nuntold tens of thousands of pounds from it. Well done\nMrs Thatcher, another good idea.\nYours,\nThe Duke of Westminster.\nDear Dave,\nCongratulations on your campaign on behalf of the\nICP candidates. Tact is clearly not your strong point.\nEven the Sun is more subtle (occasionally!.\nI'm writing to respond to Andrew Waller's letter in\nlast week's FELIX.\nWhilst rightly ridiculing the Labour Party's stand on\nlocal government financing, I did not 'deride' the\nprinciple of a local income tax. I simply expressed my\nown view that a tax based purely on 'ability to pay'\nis not necessarily the fairest system devi sable. Firstly, most obviously, income is no measure of\nability to pay. My father earns twice as much as our\nneighbour, but with five children (three at university),\nhigh mortgage, rates etc we are not much better off.\nYet my dad pays three times as much income tax, and\nwould pay twice as much local income tax. Fair?\nSecondly, lots of people will have to pay nothing,\nirrespective of how much they spend. As Mr Waller\npointed out, people who pay nothing have nothing to\nlose and everything to gain from an extravagant high-spending council. Most people in the country think\neveryone should pay something, no matter how little.\nUnder the Community Charge this minimum\n'something' is 5% of local per capita expenditure. I think that is absolutely fair and reasonable.\nI'd like to thank Mr Waller for expressing clearly the\nLiberal Democrat's point of view. Will we now hear\nfrom a Labour supporter on the Roof Tax, or is nobody\nat IC stupid enough to support Labour?\nYours,\nUltan McCarthy, Physics 2.\nI am sorry to hear your parents are so little better\noff under a Conservative Government.\nWeeks screw\nDear Dave,\nIt seems that College has found yet another way\nto screw every last penny (and then some more) out\nof us.\nWhilst paying my Weeks Hall rent of almost \u00a3600\nand in so doing sub sidi sing the incompetence of\nresidences, I picked up a leaflet for accommodation\nover the summer.\nWith a rent increase of a third for a single room to\n\u00a366 in Weeks it seems that we are now being called\non to sub sid is e the incompetence of the summer\nletting scheme (which as far as I know has never made\nany money).\nThe only other way for me to stay in central London\nover the summer is to work for the Summer Letting\nScheme under the whims and edicts of Loretta\nO 'Callaghan. Last year these included all cleaners\nbeing available day and night to porter should this be\nrequired (irrespective of contract hours) and illegally\nwithholding some students' wages at the end of the\nscheme.\nWith a four figure overdraft I have no choice but to\nstay in London and try and pay some of it off and it\nseems that I must also pay off some of College's overdraft. Because the rooms for the summer are\nbeing allocated by the accommodation office I cannot\nsign my name to this letter as I know that would\ndefinitely prejudice my application.\nName withheld by request.\nDear Dave,\nBefore I begin, I must say that I am not a loony\nactivist. I am an average IC student who at the\nmoment feels very frustrated.\nMy friends and I started looking for accommodation\nat the start of this term. Naturally, we made the\naccommodation office our first port of call. We asked\nfor some help and advice about finding a flat for the\nfollowing year. They pointed at the accommodation\nlists, which I imagine most students are familiar with.\nHowever, they mostly contain landlords who want to\nrent to students now. So, you ask for something else.\nThey then give you an application form for the College\nflats, and we all know how hard they are to get into\nif you don't know the wardens involved.\nOn asking for an alternative, you are told that there\nisn't anything else. Why isn't there a register of\nlandlords who rent to IC students each year. This, to\nme, seems to be the perfect solution. I'm sure that\npeople could spare a couple of minutes at the start\nof the year to tell the accommodation office who their\nlandlord is. The only alternative at the moment is word\nof mouth, which is very dependent on who you know.\nIn looking for flats, we have seen that we will have\nto spend \u00a350-\u00a355 on average, up to \u00a360 to be close\nto College. If we still had housing benefit this wouldn't be too bad. However, we were informed last Friday\nin FELIX that students are no longer eligible from\nSeptember of this year. If it was on the cards so soon,\nwhere was the campaign to stop it. Isn't that what\na Union is for? I can't remember when I last heard a Union representative express a view of the matter!\nIf it sounds as if I'm ranting, maybe I have every\nright to. To have this problem when we are running\nup to the exams is not only frustrating, but also very\ndisillusioning. Surely something could, and should, be\ndone.\nName withheld by request.\nWell done 3\nDear Dave,\nThe Poll Tax is fair. When private organisations\nprovide useful services such as the provision of food,\nthe consumer is charged on the basis of the value of\nthe goods or services provided. Why should this be\nany different when the provider is the local council?\nWhat about redistribution of wealth (which includes\neducation and social services)? It just happens that\nthe cost of these items, two thirds of local\ngovernment expenditure, is covered by the central\ngovernment grant (income tax and VAT) and the\nbusiness rates. All of these are taxes related to\nincome.\nLocal councils exist to protect local residents\n(students and non-students alike) from small groups\nwithin society wanting to build hideous buildings at\nenvironmental expense to them. The IC Party council\ncandidates seem to have misunderstood this basic\nconcept.\nYours,\nThomas Wyatt, Vice Chairman, ICU ConSoc.\nP.S. Much to my surprise, FELIX is improving, albeit\nslowly and laboriously. I'd like to congratulate Chris\nStapleton on becoming next year's FELIX Editor. I believe he has the skill to continue the improvement,\nand wish him the best of luck.\nPage 15\n\n"

Little does he know that\nMikey is not, as Mollie told her mother Rosie (Olympia\nDukakis), a product of artificial insemination but of\nMollie's married boyfriend Albert (George Segal).\nMollie decides to search for a 'proper' father for\nMikey. Does this mean waiting for the divorce that\nAlbert protests is proceeding slowly, falling for James,\nor going through a line of suitors? Just about here I 'll\nmention the cantankerous but lovable Grandpa Vinnie\n(Abe Vigoda).\nHang on a minute. This is hardly a rib-tickle r so far.\nBut wait, here's the good bit-baby Mikey can talk!\nThrough the voice of Bruce Willis, his wry comments\ncome to life. Even before the birth, his thoughts have\nus laughing. 'Hey! how about some apple juice down\nhere?'. His collaboration with James to make Mollie\nfall for him forms the basis of the film, but he doesn't need adults to have a good time. At the sandpit he\nbecomes a sit-down comedian and a simple push in\nthe pram is a chance to meet old friends and have an a tter. Obviously it's Mikey who is the star of the show\nbut Kirstie Alley is also very funny, especially when\nfeeding the baby. Imagining her suitors in ten years\ntime forms a memorable scene where James belches\nto keep the children happy after bringing in a mouldy\nlettuce to eat!\nWith the names and the new angle, this film is sure\nto do well, but is it funny? It's not an all-time great\nbut it's one of the funniest new films I 've seen in quite\na while. I left in a far better mood than when I went\nin. Since I can't do it justice here, you'll just have to\nsee it yourself.\nToby Jones.\nPeer Gynt\nIbsen's Peer Gynt, a Nordic fairytale is the story of\na man searching for his own soul. The play follows\nPeer's journey through the world and charters his rise\nfrom local laughing stock to wealth and recognition.\nMaterial success does not result in true happiness, for\nthis he must return to his native village and the arms\nof his childhood sweetheart.\nThe show runs a long three hours and forty minutes,\nit seldom leaves the level of a West End farce and at\ntimes lapses into 'carry-on' style. The deeper, sadder\nmoments lack power and conviction. The contrasts\nwritten into the script were not played out on the\nstage-for this reason the play did not work and\nbecame laborious.\nThe sets and properties were as lavish and\nimaginative as one would expect of the National and\nthe play as dull and 'English' as one would expect at\nthe National.\nAnna Teeman.\nTheatre\nPage 4\n\n"

    "content": "Great tits offensive\nBen Turner was elected Union Deputy\nPresident earlier this week amid a College\nrow over his election publicity.\nThe turnout for the election was very\nlow, with only about 400 votes being cast.\nMr Turner passed quota after the second\nreallocation.\nIn the first round Spenser Lane polled\n93 votes, Graeme Littler 83 and Ben\nTurner 168. New election attracted only\n40 votes. None of the candidates passed\nthe quota of 193 on the first count and the\nvotes for new election were reallocated.\nThis still left none of the candidates\npassing quota and Mr Littler's votes were\nthen reallocated. Mr Turner passed quota,\nwith 200 votes while Mr Lane polled 114\nafter the second reallocation.\nThe row over the posters emerged when\ncomplaints were received by Angus\nFraser, College Managing Director, and\nFiona Nicholas, Union Honorary\nSecretary, about the 'sexist' nature of the\ncaption. Mr Fraser is believed to have\nordered the clearing of all posters from the\nSherfield walkway as a result of the\ncomplaints.\nMiss Nicholas said she was 'sorry that\nanyone was upset. The decision to allow\na poster to be put up is very personal and\nI thought Ben's posters were OK'. Union President, Neil McCluskey,\nrecieved a letter of complaint from the\nChairman and Branch Secretary of IC\nNalgo, describing the posters as 'grossly\noffensive' and asserting that it was 'the\nlatest in a growing line of sexist copy\nemanating from the Student's Union.' He\nwas also telephoned by Mr Fraser and\nPeter Mee, the College Registrar, who\nsaid they had received complaints from\nCollege staff, some of them Nalgo\nmembers. Mr McCluskey said that his\nreply to the letter would support Ms\nNicholas' decision not to censor the\nposters.\nCatherine Nally, the Nalgo Chairman,\ntold FELIX that she was glad to see the\nback of the posters. She said she felt they\nreflected badly on the candidate and that\nwhile students could show their\ndisapproval of the can didi ate through their\nvote, the posters were also seen by other\nmembers of college who had voice.\nMs McNally 'wouldn't like to put a number to how many people had\ncomplained'. She stressed that she felt that\nif the posters had racist undertones rather\nthan sexist ones, there would have been\na far greater outcry.\nMr Turner defended the posters by\nsaying that he had 'thought the poster was\nfunny' and insisted that as the birds\npictured on the posters were Great Tits,\nthe caption was or not ho logically correct.\nHe added that he was 'miffed' that his\nposters had been taken down, and that 'if\nI'd lost, I'd have kicked arse, but I didn't, so I don't care'.\nRag's fate\nThere will be no Rag Fete this year. IC\nUnion's Rag Committee have blamed Rob\nNorthey, Refectories manager, for the\ncanceling of the fe te. Mr Northey is unable\nto supply a bar in the Main Dining Hall\n(MDH) on the day of the fe te. Mr Northey said that the Rag\nCommittee could have used the bar if they\nhad booked earlier. He told Felix that the\nRag Committee had approached him two\nweeks before the event and he had asked\nthem to return the next day while he found\nout whether a possible client would be\nusing the room. He said that the Rag\nCommittee did not return and he was later\ntold that they had cancelled the Fete. He\nsaid that they could have used the facility\nif they had returned to check with him.\nMr Northey said that there would have\nbeen problems if it rained as the fe te would\nhave been held in the Junior Commmon\nRoom. This was booked for the dance club\nfor that evening, and the mess that a Rag\nFete would leave behind would have to be\ncleaned up. He added that mud wrestling\nand def aec a ting goats were not always\nconducive to the events being held in the\nM DH. Steve Farrant, Rag Secretary and next\nyear's Rag chairman, told Felix that he did\nnot know why the fe te had not been\nre planned for Beit Quad or Prince's Gardens. 'We thought it would be better\nto call it off, he said. He added that there\nwould still be an Animal Dump on the\nQueen's Lawn on Wednesday 18th May,\ncourtesy of Poppy the goat, and the prizes\nthat had been collected would be used in\nthe May balls of the Royal College of\nScience Union and City and Guilds Union.\nDave Williams, Union Deputy\nPresident, said that although there had\nbeen a low turnout last year, there had\neasily been enough people to make it\nworth while. The poor weather during the\nlast few fe tes had put people off, he said.\n\n"

We will remain good\nfriends and I wish him all the best in his future. As\nfor the other candidate, who was not present at the\nannouncement because 'he didn't want to know', I'm glad that the 114 students who did vote for him will\nnever realise what a nightmare of a decision they\nmade.\nI apologise unreservedly to everybody who was\noffended by my poster. Many people appreciated the\nhumour and the underlying indirect message. I want\nto reassure those who did find it objectionable that\nsexism is not in my nature and I certainly will not seek\nto drag IC Union into the depths of depravity.\nCheers, and I hope I will live up to your expectations\nof me next year.\nBenjamin Turner\nNursery is looking up\nDear Dave,\nAs a parent of a child in the Day Nursery I want to\nthank you very much for the interest you showed in\nthe day nursery (FELIX 865), and especially the issue\nof the totally inadequate premises. Although your\nreport contained some minor factual mistakes, it\nhelped stir interest in the issue of the Day Nursery\npremises throughout the College.\nAs a result of this publicity, and of other such\nactions, concrete steps were taken to improve the\nexisting premises (a new fire door and fire\nextinguishers were installed, and a new vinyl floor was\ninstalled in the baby room) and more are planned (the\nbasement will be re-painted in the summer). Also, the\nCollege authorities are more aware of the problems\nof the nursery, and the parents organised themselves\nand meet weekly to discuss nursery issues and take\nactions.\nMy daughter, Nicky, is very happy at the Day\nNursery: she enjoys the company of the other\nchildren, and the care and stimulus from the nursery\nnurses. Every morning, when we arrive at the nursery,\nshe tells me: 'bye-bye', as if to signify: 'I am happy\nhere, I don't need you any longer'; and I am extremely\nrelieved and grateful to the nursery nurses for creating\nsuch a happy atmosphere for her. In these months\nNicky has learnt several things at the Day Nursery,\nand she is proud about this.\nNevertheless, the fact remains that Nicky spends\nmost of her day under artificial lighting, and that she\nhas very little opportunity to run around, and to be\noutdoors. The Day Nursery premises are inadequate,\nand-as we wrote in our original letter-l feel guilty\nand unhappy that Nicky and the nursery nurses are\nobliged to play and work under such poor conditions,\nthat I, myself, would refuse if offered to me as\nworking conditions.\nThe IC Day Nursery is an important asset of Imperial\nCollege. A lot of staff depend on it in order to be able\nto work in this College, and also, the Day Nursery\nplays an important role in student recruiting (especially\noverseas students and female students returning to\nCollege for higher degrees). The importance of the\nDay Nursery will grow even more in the future as the\npercentage of qualified women working after starting\na family increases. Also, other colleges in London,\nwith whom Imperial College has to compete, cannot\noffer this attraction. Therefore, the Day Nursery\ndeserves the College's very urgent attention and\nsupport.\nI hope that your interest, together with the actions\nof the parents, of the Day Nursery Committee and of\nthe Staff will help the nursery to obtain good\npremises, as it deserves. Hoping, that in some of the\nvery next issues of FELIX you will be in a position to\nreport about concrete steps taken for new premises\nfor the Day Nursery, and thanking you for your interest\nin the Day Nursery.\nYours,\nSophia Drossopoulou (Dr, Lecturer Computing).\nHELP WANTED\nThe Snack Bar needs students to work at lunch times and in the\nmornings.

    "content": "Nuns on the run\nFilm\nBrian and Charlie really don't like their job. In the old\ndays everything was easy. When they did a job, noone got hurt (except the insurance men, but they are\nthe biggest crooks going). Since Case took over\nthough, guns have become the order of the day, and\nthe new breed have no compunction in using them.\nWorst of all, Case has a habit of disposing of people\nwho try to leave the firm. When this happens to Norm,\na specialist in car re sprays, it's too much for Brian (Eric\nIdle) and Charlie (Robbie Coltrane). They decide to go\nstraight, by stealing some stolen money and\ns carpe ring to Rio. Things go a little bit wrong. They\nend up in a nunnery, disguised as a pair of nuns from\nChipping Sodbury, being pursued by Case's gang, the\nTriads and the Police. Not only that but Brian's girlfriend has been shot trying to save him, and is\nrecovering in the nunnery.\nThis film has a lot going for it a good cast (Idle,\nColtrane and Janet Suzman), a talented writer/director\n(Jonathan Lynn of Yes (Prime) Minister and the\nbacking of a quality name (Handmade films).\nUnfortunately this doesn't usually guarantee a good\nfilm. So does this strip of celluloid, which is being\ncompared to A Fish Called Wanda, succeed?\nWell it's a little slow to get going, although once\nthe cross dressing starts (To Alleluia! strains on the\nsoundtrack) the gags, both visual and spoken, start\nflowing thick and fast. The humour isn't exactly\nsophisticated-'Remember girls, all you need to know\nabout the Holy Trinity is that God is like a shamrock.\nSmall, green and split into three parts!' the disguised\nIdle tells some trainees. Coltrane and Idle are\naccomplished performers though and are able to milk\nthe script for everything that it is worth. They also\nmanage to make the basically preposterous notion of\nthese two men managing to pass themselves off as\nnuns moderately believable.\nThe unfortunate side effect of making a film which\nbases much of its humour around religion is that\npeople are going to start crying 'blasphemy' which is\na shame because if they looked past the end of their\nbigoted noses they'd find that in its own way the film\nis actually quite religious. There is an implicit\nundercurrent that suggest that God is the mover\n- \"f behind the plot.\nHumour is a very personal thing and so it is difficult\nto recommend such a film. If you like Monty Python\nor Comic Strip humour though this is a perfect exam\nblues remedy. For me, this is certainly the funniest\nthing I 've seen since A Fish Called Wanda.\nAdam T. Ballet at Sadler's Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal is one of a number of\noverseas dance companies that visit Sadler's Wells\neach year.\nThe company founded by Genevieve Salbaing in\n1972 is dedicated to the fusion of ballet and jazz in\ntheir many and diverse forms.\nThe evening's programme was a series of short\nballets each choreographed separately. The ballets\nwere set to music as diverse as Igor Stravinski and\nJanice Joplin. As the choreography and music for\neach ballet differed so did their impact. Although all\nmembers of the company had tremendous technical\nexpertise there were some who held the stage more\npowerfully than others; these ballets were made\ncaptivating by the dancers' energy and control.\nBallet has a somewhat esoteric image. Les Ballets\nJazz de Montreal shatters any such prejudice-the\ndance is contemporary, immediate and entertaining.\nDue to the delay of the Easter break this review\ncomes too late to catch Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal\nbut Sadlers Wells does offer diverse and exciting\nentertainment in opera and ballet. The Kodo\nDrummers are highly recommended for their passion\nand power-their run is from 7-19 May-for more\ninformation call the Box Office on 278 8916.\nAnna Teaman.\nDance A married woman's guide\nto adultery Book\nAdultery is commonplace, you see it in films and to\nsome of the tabloid newspapers it is their bread and\nbutter, but it does not always have to be the man that\ninitiates the affair.\nMaking pointed character comments and written in\nan attractive style, the book trips along gently with\nthe plot snaking through the complex world of male-female relationships.\nThere are some bitter twists in the tale, an example\nof this is when a friend is depressed about her own\naffair she starts talking about it to another friend who\nshe believes not to be having any form of relationship.\nDuring their discussion the second friend reveals that\nshe is also having an affair, with the other woman's brother!\nThroughout the book, she uses the conflict between\nmen and women, and the dilemma that many women\nface while having an affair: not wanting to ruin a marriage and also loving somebody else's husband.\nThe story is told through the eyes of one of the\nwomen having an affair. This creates a more intimate\nand interesting book than would otherwise have been\nachieved.\nIt has received much critical acclaim from the press,\nand also from Fay Weldon who gives the interesting\ncomment that 'If a book could equal an affair, this one\nwould be it'. If this is true then perhaps I should get\nmarried as I found the book very enjoyable.\nRecommended reading, and you don't have to be\nmarried to understand it.\nIan Hodge.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Adam Tinworth tells all about Scottish culture and fashion, from the 'Glasgow Kiss' to the City of Architecture Glasgow has a flavour of its own.\nBeyond the tartan curtain\u2014Glasgow\nGlasgow? City Of Culture? Admittedly it seems a little\nimprobable, after all as a city it doesn't exactly have\nthe best reputation in the world-The Glasgow Kiss\n('Stitch this, jimmy'), the Gorbals, the amicable\nrelations between Rangers and Celtic, etc.. No, if\nthere was to be a cultural centre in Scotland, surely\none would think of Edinburgh first. Much more in line\nwith previous culture capitals such as Athens,\nFlorence and Paris Isn't it?\nWell not really. To many Scots Edinburgh is viewed\nas little more than a colony of England, with more\nSassenachs than Scots. They're probably ignoring the\nfact that as assen ach is any one born south of Perth,\nnot the border. Indeed, rumour has it that pressure\nwas recently put on Edinburgh University to accept\nmore Scottish students, which might explain the\nunusually low UCCA offers many Scots got from them\nlast year. Edinburgh's big claim to fame is its world\nfamous cultural Festival, held every summer. Glasgow\nhas begun to build its own reputation with its yearly\nMayfest (held in May surprisingly enough). Glasgow\npromotes itself as the home of 'real' Scottish culture,\nand it is probably more justified in the claim than any\nof the other cities. It really feels Scottish in a way\nEdinburgh doesn't. An initial wander round Glasgow doesn't reveal\nimmediate signs of any great cultural upheaval.\nGeorge Square looks much as it ever did, Clydeside\nremains its post Garden Festival self and you will still\nget beaten up for wearing the wrong colour in certain\nparts of the city. The signs are there though.\nBuchanan Street has sprouted banners, window\ndisplays tend to reflect the theme and the occasional\noddly painted Taxi crawls by. Discreetly placed\nComputer information points and direction signs lead\nyou to the many venues and buses, shelters and the\nUnderground all look somewhat spruced up. With a little effort a whole new Glasgow opens up.\nIn true Scottish fashion, they are claiming that they\nare taking 'culture' not to mean the theatre, arts and\nthe rest of the high brow events, although they have\ntheir place. Instead the slant is towards culture as in\nsociety. Perhaps the most successful example of this\nis the huge new Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition\nconstructed under the vaulted red-brick arches under\nCentral Station. The aim is to create a city within a city, to portray Glasgow's present and its past in one\nvenue. They try to achieve this using a combination\nof computers, audio/visual displays, static exhibits\nand live events. Also down there are a restaurant, cafe\nand souvenir shop. In the specially constructed theatre\nand cinema, a wide variety of events are being staged\nincluding drama, cabaret and jazz. It is an ambitious\nproject and one which is surprisingly successful. It's one of those venues it will take a couple of visits to\nappreciate.\nIn a similar vein is the City of Architecture with a selection of displays glorifying the city's buildings. If\nyou visit during May you can even go on a guided walk\nround the city looking at all the wonderful buildings.\nTo be honest, Edinburgh does have one big advantage\nover Glasgow-its a lot prettier.\nVisual stimulation is perhaps better obtained at the\nart exhibitions. Glasgow already has a reasonable\nreputation for art. The Glasgow School of Art is highly\nrespected and the Burrel Collection is surely\nScotland's finest art gallery. The goodies on offer\nrange from the conventional, photographic and avant-Page 8\ngarde visual arts displays to the truly bizarre. The best\nexample of the latter is the Giants, Gems and Jewels\nexhibition which includes a greenhouse of growing\ncrystals, sculpture using molten lava from Etna and\ncrystal-related drawings by well-known comic artist\nMoebius. Sounds fascinating.\nComics themselves, that medium that was once\nstrictly for kids, and which is now gaining (zap) adult\n(biff) credibility (kapo w!) have also found their place.\nA major comic book convention was held a month\nago, attended by many of the luminaries of this\nnascent art form and the 'Bogie Man' comic book has\nbeen launched to coincide with the celebrations (see\nFELIX issue 850).\nThe more conventional types are also catered for.\nGlasgow has a reasonable selection of theatres across\nthe town and a good selection of material is being\nperformed, from very Scottish productions-Wnen\nElvis lived in Meikle Earnock-Xo touring productions\nof already successful shows such as Alan Bennett's Single Spies and the RSC's Les Liaisons Dangereuse.\nPerhaps the most exciting venue is the Citizen's Theatre in the Gorbals. Currently showing is Brecht's Mother Courage and productions of George Bernard\nShaw, Goldoni and Nicholas Rowe. It has seating for\n600 people even though leg room is rather cramped,\nand a tendency to show superbly visual productions\nof plays which are not often performed.\nThe music lovers will find the events unfortunately\ndominated by Classical and Celtic music. This is a pity\nand rather disproves the notion that this year is to\nrepresent all levels of culture. Those bananas looking\nfor horny Indie bands are best to buy a copy of the\nlocal equivalent of Time Out, The List, and scour the\nmusic columns for what few bands you can find. For\nthose of you that would like to see something a little\nmore traditional one of the many ce ili dhs( pronounced\nah-kay-lees) being held throughout the year is well\nworth a visit. They can be quite good fun (honestly).\nThe Scottish Opera have a pretty good programme as\nwell, with upcoming productions of Madama\nButterfly, Cosi Fan Tutte and Salome.\nThe Scottish Cabaret scene is possibly better than\nthe London one at the moment and is well worth a look. The Clyde Cavern is a venue to look out for as\nis anything starring the Funny Farm. Most of the major\nvenues have something comedic at sometime or\nanother.\nGlasgow is a very religious city. The antagonism\nbetween Rangers and Celtic is basically a dispute\nbetween protestants and catholics. This is being\nreflected (excluding the violence hopefully) by a series\nof events under the banner The Spirit Of The City. This\nwill involve Christian and other communities and will\nbe offering 'an opportunity to explore meaning,\ninspiration, renewal and growth'. Hmm. Perhaps I should warn the world that Scottish religion tends to\nbe very dour. In fact, it's as boring as hell (sic).\nThere is some sport for those who find watching\nanything which doesn't involve a ball an intolerable\nstrain on the brain. The Scots have progressed a little\nbeyond Haggis Hunting and Caber Tossing. The Youth\n(under 14) Olympiad is being held there, which should\nhave the general population on the edge of their seats.\nWell, actually they haven't got the c aber tossing out\nof their national system. The World Highland Games\nChampionships are being held in June. They should\nbe easy to find. There's going to be massed Pipe\nBands there. Hundreds of Bagpipes playing\nsimultaneously. Oh my God. Somewhat more\nattractive are The European Special Olympics, first\nheld in Dublin in 1985, which give people with special\nneeds a chance to participate in international\ncompetition.\nAlso a range of new works in a wide variety of\nmediums have been specially commissioned from\nartists.composers and playwrights. The jewel in the\ncrown is expected to be a large theatre project called\nThe Ship which has been commissioned from Bill\nBryden. A tribute to the long gone days of the great\nshipbuilding industry on the Clyde, 20 actors will\nperform the play while 10 shipyard workers build a ship and launch it during the course of the play. Well,\nit's unusual.\nThere has certainly been a real effort to make this\nyear a success. Whether it will succeed or not is\nanother question. Unfortunately it does look as if the\nmuch vaunted universality of it all has failed to\nmaterialise. Still its worth a look, especially\nconsidering that events will probably be cheaper than\ntheir London nearest equivalents.\nFor further information write to Glasgow 1990, PO\nBox 88, GLASGOW, Scotland.

    "content": "^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nJoseph Kazamias gives his opinion on space, time and other things. f9 What is reality? ms\nSpace and time are merely the ignorant man's efforts\nto explain the 'reality' that his life's experiences have\nconstructed for him. Space and time, and even so\ncalled 'reality' are all an illusion. When we were born\ninto this life yet unmarked by word ly experiences,\ntime and space did not exist for us. Distance and all\nother 'man-made' concepts had to be learnt. A child\nhas no idea how far away an object is if 'he' (or 'she')\nhas never experienced that object before, to him it is\nonly an array of colours. In reaching out for the object,\nhis success or failure of touching it is part of the\nprocess of learning distance. If he misses, his brain\nwill instruct his arm in another direction, and so\ngradually he will learn the idea of distance through\n'personal ising' the objects around him.\nthe telly, going to bed at a certain time, or whatever\nit may be, it seems we live our life governed by\ncreation of our own ignorance, time.\nSpace also supports time. It is through our\nidentification of objects in motion at certain 'speeds'\n(merely our visual field changing colours) that both\nspeed and time are given reality. Time and space, the\naxioms upon which 'science' is built, complimenting\neach other and the whole illusion of our reality so\nconvincingly.\nScience, being based on human ignorance therefore\nwas developed in an attempt for our intellect to\ncomprehend our 'being'. The concepts of space and\ntime, both founded on 'thought', can never bring us\nthe completeness we are searching for, why else do\nWoody Allen getting to grips with the concept of time\nThfi nth pr man-maH pm n rp nts arp almost suddenly wp ep?\nThe other man-made concepts are almost suddenly\ngiven 'reality' when the child learns to speak.\nLanguage is probably our greatest bind to illusion. For\nit is through learning to speak that the child no longer\nlives 'out of time', in the moment that is, and starts\nliving 'in time', by looking forward to things. It is\nlanguage and experiences with it, that impose this\nidea of a self, or ego. As far as he is concerned when\nhe sits on his chair whipping his horse's behind he is\na cowboy. When he runs around his room with a broomstick between his legs he is the wizard, flying\nfrom star to star. He only becomes the 'little boy'\nwhen his parents and friends have told him, through\nlanguage, 'Joseph, don't do that; let's got out to play;\nif you're a good boy, mummy's going to give you a present' etc, etc, until he's so conditioned by this idea\nthat he is this 'little boy'. He starts to believe it. He\nthen continues his life enslaved by his emotions into\ncraving those experiences which bring him pleasure\nand averting those which bring him pain. It is in his\nidentification s, through language, of objects and\nexperiences that remove him from the moment, into\nregretting past actions and anticipating future ones.\nEvery such like or dislike reinforcing the past like or\ndislike until he has created his own 'reality', his own\nworld that he believes is the objective world.\nLife's experiences continually confirm for us that\nspace and time exist. Every day the sun rises and\nevery night it sets. It begins to feel like it's a Monday\nmorning when we look forward to playing with our\nfriends in the nursery, blissfully unaware of the\nprocess in creation. It's the formation of habits,\ngoverned by our emotions, that cast the die of illusion.\nYet within this human quality lies the means of our\nsalvation (which I shall not elaborate on here).\nSome people buy watches to efficiently perform\ntheir habits. Whether it be going to work, watching\nwe search if not for our incompleteness? Even if\nscience were to find the solution for our existence that\nsolution would merely be another 'thought'. Such\nsolutions are unceasingly questionable. 'If this is the\nreason for our existence, then what's the point of\nthat?' etc, etc, etc, it can never end! The intellect, or\nmind, can only fail to bring us that completeness we\nare so seeking, that is why Yoga was developed for\nthe spirit to experience it!\nIf we took some time out to practice meditation we\nwould see the construction of time in the process. We\nwould see how it is merely our 'thoughts' that take\nus from one minute to the next, one experience to the\nnext. With further development the thought flow\nceases, and 'time' no longer exists! The acquired\nawareness also developed allows us to realise that\npleasure and pain are merely conditioned responses\nand that there is nothing to look forward to or shy\naway from, that there's just the moment and there\nalways has been, we've just been too caught up in\n'our reality' to realise. We don't even need to practice\nmeditation to know that time is an illusion. The more\naware we become of a minute the longer it lasts. How\nreal can it be then? And as for space, is it no wonder\nthat we can never grasp the concept of 'infinity' when\nthe axioms on which 'space' it is built are those of\nour own ignorance? That's also why we can't conceive of the beginning of time, that also began an\n'infinite' number of years ago.\nI can conceive of the day when scientists realise\nthat all matter is made from energy which is ultimately\nlight, and that this illusive 'Realm of light' creation\ncannot be understood using our ignorance-based tools\nbut through more practical means, namely the\n'science' of Yoga.\nJoseph Kazamias (Elec Eng 2).\nBibliography: 'Autobiography of a Yogi'.\nWeek\n\u2022 'Intelligent' vacuum cleaners able to tell the\ndifference between 'quite dirty' and 'not that dirty at\nall' look set to make a few bucks on the back of\nforthcoming 'fuzzy' computer software. The system\nallows the computer to assign the carpet a value of\nzero to one for cleanliness, and suction is adjusted\naccordingly.\nInvented by computer scientist Lofti Zadeh at the\nUniversity of California twenty years ago, 'fuzzy'\nsystems have found their way into washing machines,\nrobots and automatic public transport systems\nexclusively in Japan. The Laboratory of International\nFuzzy Engineering set up by the Japanese\nGovernment is backed by companies such as Minolta,\nCanon, Toyota and Honda wanting a piece of the\naction.\n\u2022 The Japanese Government is preparing to more\nthan quadruple its use of plutonium in two years.\n\u00a375 million is being allocated to the construction\nof an armed escort for shipments of reprocessed\nplutonium from Europe. Japan's Science and\nTechnology Agency (STA) reckon on needing 0.9 tons\nby 1992 for a prototype breeder reactor. This is at\nodds with the predictions of the Nuclear Control\nInstitute in the USA. They claim there will be no need\nfor imported plutonium until 1999, by which time a demonstration advanced thermal reactor will be in\naction. But Itaru Watanake of the STA says that\nplutonium is fundamental to Japan's energy policy,\nand they plan to spend some \u00a3 4 0 0 0 million on a reprocessing plant of their own.\n\u2022 Sir Eric Ash is back on the Advisory Board for the\nResearch Councils as one of six independent\nmembers. The announcement comes almost a month\nafter the reincarnation of the ABRC. Other members\ninclude Sir Charles Recce (of the UFC) and Professor\nMichael Hart (from University of Manchester Physics\nDepartment).\n\u2022 Research into the San Francisco Earthquake of\nOctober last year agrees with initial speculation\nregarding the tragic collapse of part of the Nimitz\nFreeway. Columbia University's Lamont Doherty\nGeological Observatory, attribute the destruction to\nrock types on which the freeway was built. There\nwere three main factors contributing to the collapse\nof the road. Firstly estuarine mud accumulated in the\nlast 10,000 years amplifies earthquake shocks far\nmore than the older Ice Age alluvium, upon which the\ndouble decked carriageway remained intact.\nSecondly, the optimum frequency at which the mud\namplifies coincides with the resonant frequency of the\nstructure-between one and four hertz. Finally the\nsediment below the doomed section was of just the\nright depth to provide the catastrophic frequencies.\n\u2022 The British otter population is in serious decline\ndue to the chemical pollution of rivers they inhabit.\nAccording to biologist Dr Chris Mason of the\nUniversity of Essex polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)\nare responsible for damaging the wombs of the female\notter. Dr Mason is concerned that the highly toxic\nPCBs may be leaking from hydraulic irrigation pumps\nfound on many rivers in the Fenlands. They collect in\nfat, particularly in large oily fish which form a large\npart of the otters' diet.\nPage 7\n\n"
