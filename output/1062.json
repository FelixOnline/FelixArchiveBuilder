Every\nsong made you feel something.\nUnfortunately the same can rarely be said of\nPomo for Pyros, the current project led by ex-Janes f font man Perry Farrell. The problem for\nPerry is that his new baby will always be judged\nagainst the immensely high standards of its older\nbrother. The sad truth is that Pomo for Pyros\nseem increasingly unable to reach these stan-dards.\nDon't get me wrong, 'Good God's Urge' is\nmusically a very good album. Compared to the\noutput of most other American alternative bands\nthese days, it is brilliant. It's definitely better than\nthe previous album, which was universally slated\nfor its sheer mediocrity. The crucial point is that\ndespite using many of the same musical styles\nand ideas of Jane's Addiction, the end product\njust doesn't quite hit the spot.\nThe new tracks touch on a new vein of psychedelia and bliss ed out coolness but the sound\nis still the same. The overall impression is that\nPerry has calmed down, stopped being angry and\nhas now gone all mystical. 'Tahitian Moon' and\n'Kimberly Austen' stand out in this respect, and\nare the ones that come close to repeating past\nglories.

Undeniably there are still\nsome very good Britpop bands out there but it\nseems that Placebo are heading in just one of the\ndirections that new guitar-based alternative\nmusic is progressing towards.\nThe lead singer has a very distinctive whining voice and has spent most of his life in the tiny\ncountry of Luxembourg. There is an ever present sexual undercurrent throughout the album,\nas in the possibly autobiographical 'Nancy Boy'\nwhere the lead singer's bisexuality comes to the\nfore. An immense feeling of sadness and sorrow\npermeates most of the record, particularly in\nsongs such as 'I Know' and 'Lady of the Flowers',\na trait seen in some great albums of the recent\npast such as the Smashing Pumpkins' 'Siamese\nDream'.\nThere is another side to Placebo, heard in\ntheir debut single 'Bruise Pristine' and the current '36 Degrees', which are full of sheer exuberance and racing grating guitars.

The\nrefurbishment of the bookstore in the early\nnineties turned a reasonable trading outlet\ninto a major going concern. A referendum\nheld last year on rejoining the National Union\nof Students received an unexpectedly loud\nvoice calling for autonomy to be maintained.\nIf not actually fighting off the mythical demon\nof disinterest, is Imperial College Union at\nleast making inroads into determining its own\nfuture?\nThe academic year began with the Union\nstubbornly refusing to budge on a College\nproposal to move them to the Sherfield\nBuilding. ICU now looks likely to retain its Beit\nQuad premises, but with an influx of\nhundreds of medical students beginning in\n1998, the scope for expansion looks limited.\nCollege are planning to put management of\nthe bookstore out to tender, potentially\ndepriving the Union of it's major\nnon-Governmental source of funding at a time when capital funding across the spectrum\nof Higher Education is set to drop by 50%.\nWith the benefit of a year's hindsight, the\nSabbatical Officers of 1995 -1996 consider\nwhat future there is for the Student's Union of\nImperial College...\n\"Last summer\nwas horrible, but\nit made us think\nabout things a lot: think about\nhow we use the\nbuilding, and\nhow we can\nimprove it. It\nforced us to\nquestion why we\nare here, and\nwe're coming up\nwith constructive\nresponses.\"\nSarah White,\nICU President\nO ur location seems a lot more secure than it did a year ago,\nwhich means we can think about our future. The uncertainty which was hanging over our heads meant that we\ncouldn't go ahead with projects such as the refurbishment of the\nEnts lounge. Now we are getting things up up scratch: our long-term\naim is to get to a public Ents license, so that we can have bar extensions with more ease - the University of London Union can keep\ntheir bar open until lam whenever they like. And we would also be\nable to use more of the building, and get bands in.\n\"Last summer was horrible, but it made us think about things a lot: think about how we use the building, and how we can improve\nit. It forced us to question why we are here, and we're coming up\nwith constructive responses.\n\"I think it's quite likely that we will be able to get some of the\nBeit basement space when Biology move out: there's nothing else to\nput in there l All we can do with the existing space is improve the\nservice, but we can't expand on what we do.\n\"We're also considering what else we do, and how we make students more aware of what's on offer: there's no point in waking\nthem up by putting posters up saying 'Come to the bar.' The\nresource centre should be good. It will hopefully have phones, a fax\nmachine, photocopiers and computers and all the things clubs and\nsocieties need. They'll pop in and think, 'I know, I 'll pop into the\nadvice centre and sort out that dod gy contract while I'm here.' The\neasiest way of telling someone what you do is to show it to them -make them walk past it.\n\"The big issue of the future will be coping with the cuts in higher education funding. Whether you go somewhere with a decent\nsports' hall is less important than whether you are there at all.\"\n\n"

Short scenes, narrated by and\nstarring John Malkovich as a film director, link\neach story seamless ly. Story 1: Chronicle of a love affair that never\nexisted. As the production notes puts it, \"The\nstrange story of Carmen (Ines Sastre) and\nSilvano (Kim Ross-Stuart) whose sexual desire is\nso strong that the act itself is a desecration\".\nThey have both been touched by love, despite\nonly meeting twice in three years. Their love\nremains un consummated at their reunion and\nSilvano leaves Carmen undressed on the bed.\nStory 2: The girl, the crime. A director\n(Malkovich) meets a sales assistant (Sophie\nMarceau) in a shop. Fleeting glances (between\nthe two) turn to uncomfortable stares. He\nleaves, she follows and she tells, \"I killed my\nfather - stabbed him twelves times\".\nStory 3: Don't look for me. A married man\n(Peter Weller) has an affair with a young woman\n(Chiara Caselli). Exasperated by his inability to\ndecide between his wife or the young se duc tress, his wife leaves him. She moves into a rented flat\nand meets Carlo (Jean Reno) whose wife has just\nleft him and taken all the furniture with her.\nStory 4: The body of dirt. Vincent Perez\nchats up Irene Jacob and walks with her to\nchurch. He suddenly wakes up in the church\nand desperately searches for her, he catches up\nwith her and asks \"Can I see you tomorrow?\",\nshe answers, \"Tomorrow I...\". Depending on the way you look at it, the\nendings are either tragic or incredibly amusing.\nDespite being four separate stories the underlining tone ol Beyond the Clouds is melancholy\nmainly due to Malcovich's thought provoking\nnarration. This film is about love, and its novel\napproach makes for an interesting view.\n\"film: beautiful thing ,: ,,\nIf I had to name the worst part of Beautiful\nThing, I'd have a hard job deciding between the\nsoundtrack and the ending. Very much a feel\ngood movie, it tells the tale of Jamie (Glen\nBerry) and Ste (Scott Neal), two teenage boys\nwho fall in love. Two straight actors play the main\nparts and give a realistic edge to some of the awkwardness of the early steps of realisation, but the\nfilm's biggest fault lies in the speed and simplicity\nwith which they come out. If anything the plot\nbelittles the (difficulties the boys would face in\nreality, especially in the uninviting setting of the\n33ham e smead estate.\nComing out would be so much simpler if all\nmothers got used to the news of a gay son as\nquickly as Sandra (Linda Henry). There is a horrendously na ff wailing violin soundtrack, with\nsome Mamas and Papas thrown in from next-door neighbour Leah (Tameka Empson) and her\ndrunken antics, but if you can ignore it the scattering of humour brings out a good laugh. In fact\nit is the humour which saves the film, with some\nexcellent one liners from Sandra's prat of a boyfriend Tony (Ben Daniels). And the ending?\nWell, the less said the better.\n-video: jack and sarah t Rchard E. Grant (Withnail & I) plays Jack, a successful lawyer married to the pregnant Sarah\n(Imogen Stubbs). After moving into their new\nhouse and having a house-warming party at\nwhich Jack gets hideously drunk, Sarah goes into\nlabour. In the ensuing panic Jack is knocked\nunc on cio us. He awakes later to be told that\nSarah has died giving birth to a baby daughter,\nwhom Jack names Sarah. At first Jack turns to\nthe bottle for comfort, but his parents soon\nmake him face up to his responsibilities by\nleaving baby Sarah with him. During his adjustment to fatherhood he hires Amy (Samantha\nMathis) an American nanny with too little experience in looking after small babies, resulting in\nseveral arguments between her and Jack. After\nregaining his feet Jack begins dating again but it\nis only when Amy leaves, having told Jack she's fed up with being taken for granted, that Jack\nrealises how much he has come to love Amy.\nRichard E. Grant plays the middle-class,\nprospective father in the typical way: appearing\nflustered, over-protective, and totally unprepared for fatherhood. Dame Judi Dench plays\nJack's mother a woman, who has no faith in her\nson's ability to cope with a new-bom baby and\ncertainly doesn't agree with his choice of\nbabysitter.\nThe film, although dealing with rather tragic\ncircumstances takes a rather light-hearted view\nof it and has some extremely fon ny scenes, the\ndialogue including some wonderfully timed sarcastic one-liners from Jack.\nThis video is well worth checking out if\nyou're after a video which requires the minimum of concentration to follow the story-line.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH1995. ELEVEN\n\"The next\nfive years\nare\nfucking\ncrucial.\nThe situation looks\nbrilliant\nfrom one\nangle, and\ndire from\nanother.\"\nTim Townend,\nClubs and Societies\nIC is sorted academically: IC's student development is not.\nWe're in a brilliant position, if only we can develop ideas. The\nclubs and societies have a massive base of activity, and we have\nnice venues and good facilities, especially if the refurbishment of\nthe Ents lounge and the development of the sports centre goes\nahead. We have the foundations, but we need to invest in student\ndevelopment. ICU is there to enable students to do what they\ncouldn't do on their own, but ii we're so insular we never look out,\nwe'll never get anywhere.\n\"We need to consolidate our position, decide what our key\nfunctions are, and focus on them. It's like a war: if we dei end on all\nsides we will end up losing on all sides. The next five years are fucking crucial. The situation looks brilliant from one angle, and fucking\ndire from another. I think that's why the staff are really happy on\nsome days, and then miserable as Hell the next.\n\"IC academically is second to none, but students haven't got\nthe support network that they would have if they went somewhere\nequally demanding, like Cambridge. The one-to-one system there\nmeans that if you miss a single tutorial there is someone worrying\nabout you. I guess that's why employers like IC graduates: they\nhaven't been spoon-fed. But we do need improvements in our tutorial system. If they don't change attitudes, we're never going any-where, and it's ICU's job to make sure those attitudes are changed.\"\nWe 're as certain as we'll ever be that we will be staying put\nin Beit. Ideally we would like to expand into some of the\nground floor at the front of the Quad. The promise of\nsome basement space would be significant. It might end up as some\nkind of a bargain; College could put money into it, and in return\ncontrol it over the vacations. If we get that, it will give enough room\nto expand the ents lounge into the Print Unit, and possibly move\nthe snooker rooms into the basement too. And if the new sports'\ncentre goes ahead, we could convert the gym into rooms for clubs,\nsocieties and welfare. The basement area is huge: apart from anything else, it would give us more storage space, and that's one of the\nbiggest problems we've got.\n\"To sum it up, we can get space, but we can't get money, which\nis an improvement on last year, when we couldn't get either. So we\nneed to make our own money, and that's under attack as well. We\njust don't know what's happening with the future of the bookstore.\nAt the moment we're working on a proposal for what we would\noffer, assuming it goes out to tender. The benefits of us running it\nfar outweigh the benefits of anyone else running it, but no doubt the\nargument that it's better to keep the money within the IC community will fall on deaf ears.\"\n\"We can get\nspace, but we\ncan't get\nmoney, which\nis an improvement on last\nyear, when we\ncouldn't get\neither.\"\nMatt Crompton,\nFinance and Services\n\"Where are you\ngoing to get\n\u00a315\nmillion to pay\nfor a Students'\nUnion in these\ndays when\neverything is\nfunded by either\nthe PFI or the\nNational\nLottery?\"\nRachel Walters,\nFelix Editor & Print Unit Manager\nI like to think that Felix is continuing to improve its role as a bridge between College and students. There's so much happening at the moment, and because we're not a particularly confrontational student body, much of it goes by without any chance\nfor discussion. Besides, I think that College would get a lot more\nsupport for the positive developments if there wasn't such a strong\nperception that so much is completely underhand.\n\"What I find slightly worrying is that the current location of\nthe Print Unit is the one prime target for the extension of entertainment facilities. It would a very great shame if we were moved\nto some inaccessible gro tty basement. The current location is bad\nenough, but I'm not sure if we are a priority as far as the Union is\nconcerned! Being completely selfish, a move to Sherfield would\nhave been superb for us: we were looking at a purpose built 2-level\nprint shop in the middle of things. But then I wonder if it could ever\nhave happened: where were they going to get \u00a315 million to pay for\na students union in these days when everything is either funded by\nthe PFI or the National Lottery?\"\n\n"

    "content": "simon baker\nAnd now, the end is near,\nand so I face the final dead-line. After 9 months and\nnearly 20,000 words, I have\nrun out of opportunities to\nvent my spleen on you, the\ngood folk of Imperial. I have\nalso reached the end of my\ndegree. Not averse to the\nodd clich e, as you all know by now, I must say\nthat it has gone incredibly quickly.\nMy friends, I 'll say it clear. I 'll state my case\nof which I'm certain. In October 1993, little old\nme pitched up at Linstead Hall, found the bar\nand the rest is history. I arrived as a young, happy-go ducky idealist and leave as, well, form your\nown opinions. I 've seen people, buildings and, of\ncourse, signs come and go, the latter not necessarily on a one-in-one-out basis. Felix certainly\nhasn't missed out change over the last three\nyears. Many of you will remember this august\npublication under the stewardship of my dear\nold friend Beccy 'as vital to the mn ning of Felix\nas David Mellor is to the Elite Model Agency'\nLand, who printed one of my letters criticising\nher under the banner, \"Will he ever shut up?\"\nClearly no. Last year was a dramatic improvement under the control of Owain Bennallack,\nthough I did have cause to rattle the cage of Mr\nMarcus Alexander, aka 'Prater Fiam'. A blind\nseven-year old could extract more meaning from\nthe Portuguese version of the Maastricht Treaty\nthan some of his writings, but there you go. As\nfor this year, modesty forbids me to be specific,\nbut I must congratulate Rachel on a brilliant job\nand thank her for giving me this space with\nwhich to amuse and entertain you, I hope,\nthroughout the year.\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my\nway. Regrets, I 've had a few. And I'd had a few\nthat fateful night at King's a few weeks ago.\nDance like a demon, I tell you. It does seem a shame that despite the way we avidly followed\neach other's careers, Ian Caldwell and I never\nmet. I put it down to some swine pinching all the\nRector's dinner invitations from my pigeon hole.\nWhen it comes to College Estates I did what I had to do and saw it through without exe mp tion. I planned (members of said department\nunsure of this word's meaning are referred to a dictionary] each charted course of action, each\ncareful step along the satirical byway. Who am I kidding? Attacking Estates was like shooting fish\nin a barrel, as taxing as stealing candy from a baby. I suspect that all the noisy building work\naround College will be suspended now that the\nexams are out of the way, since we wouldn't want to disturb the paying guests over the sum-mer, dear me no.\nThe post of UL U President being occupied\nby Ghassan Karian is also regrettable, although I hear he has now resigned, giving me yet another\nexcuse to spend some money in Southside Bar. I have long held reservations about him, confirmed by his moonlighting for Uncle Tony Blair,\nbut his response to the no\nconfidence vote was\nbeyond belief. How dare\nhe compare his disgraceful\nbehaviour with the course\nof action taken by Lady\nThatcher in 1990. She was\neffectively the victim of a coup d 'etat, whereas this\ndespicable rat has shown\nthat he couldn't give a toss about the people he\nrepresents or the post he occupies.\nI also wish that I had intervened in the\nConSoc fiasco earlier. It all seems such a long\ntime since these pages were filled with letters\nfrom the legendary triumvirate of Bayley, Boon\nand Summers, firing off salvos willy-n illy like a machine gun with Parkinson's. They moaned\nabout the national press, they moaned about the\nCollege press, they've even moaned about each\nother. In fact, they attacked everyone except the\npeople who they're supposed to, namely IC\nLabour Club. Such was the self-destruction\nachieved by these three clowns that they have\nbeen forced to remain tight-lipped for the rest of\nthe year for fear of further embarrassment. All\nthis at a crucial time in British politics, where a little debate would not have gone amiss. We can\nbut hope that next year's incumbents do a better job, and let's be honest, that is not the greatest challenge facing mankind.\nYes, there were times, I'm sure you knew,\nwhen I bit off more than I could chew. After\nreceiving the first letter of complaint in the first\nterm from Sarah White about New Solutions, I thought that I'd be a bit clever. She moaned that\nI hadn't read any of the relevant documents, so\nI immediately asked for copies, hoping that she\nwouldn't have them. Of course, she did, and\nkindly provided me with one. She also tipped\nme off about a meeting at Goldsmith's College\n(issue 1043), attended by Mr Karian and some\nof the most left-wing people on the face of the\nEarth, which proved to be very enjoyable, so no\nharm done. Anyway, I must wish Sarah all the\nbest for next year, safe in the knowledge that she\nwill do a better job than him at UL U and stay\nthe distance. But through it all, when there was\ndoubt, I ate it up and spat it out, which brings me\nnicely to College Catering. When I was at school,\nan article I wrote about school dinners got me\nhauled up before the Headmaster to explain\nmyself. It is therefore reassuring that tiling s are\ndealt with a little more rationally at Imperial.\nCriticism is at least accepted, but mismanagement and inefficiency seem to get the ostrich\nhead treatment of blissful ignorance. It would be\ngreat to think that one day the current outfit\nmight be booted out after competitive tender-ing. We can't go on propping up the M DH to the\ntune of nearly \u00a3200 000 per year, a loss partly\ndisguised by selling mediocre sandwiches at vastly inflated prices in the JCR and the efforts of\nSouthside Shop, where multinational corporations could be bankrupted buying the weekly\ngroceries. Is it unreasonable to expect hot and-\n"

[t; Wli;:\nless than a week into my term as DP(F&S) and Rachel Came to interview me.\nEven at that early stage she demonstrated her eye for an interesting story as well as her passion for various metals (the interview was regarding the Union's plumbing!). It was here that I first w if ness ed arguably Rachel's greatest strength; her ability to charm the socks off absolutely\nanybody. Her natural friendliness and approach ability hove been a great<ps set to Felix throughout the year.\n\u2022 Editing Felix is a difficult job and Rachel has had her fair share of sin j ii on. From coping with the male, dominated working environment (even by 1C standards) through to balancing the vieWS'd^^ ll^pJ^^^^^^l riou s Clubs and Societies and individuals. This proved\nto be an impossible task, as highlighted by a remark she once made: \"Since everybody regularly complains that Felix is biased against them -1 must be doing something right!\" M Throughout the year Rachel's dedication has been amazing. Many of ol\n.deed a twenty hour day at some stage in our time at IC,\nbut how many of us can claim to have worked these hours twice a week for most or an academic year?\nRachel's approach ability has also caused her a lot of frustration, if ego laffy^ or ing the busiest fin w j bf her week somebody would request\nlime do talk through an issue, often completely unrelated to her post jb spd it or* This frequency red ucl M 'her minimal mid-week sleep to none at\nall; In fairness, few people realise the effort involve c.11 reducing Felix every week, I certainly didn't lost y<l dr.

I 've heard too many grim tales of Editorial\nPrint Unit. The Great Separation of Felix and Print Unit is\n>\nk gets produced more efficiently (or at all).\nApparently it's 'traditional' to write some nice words about the outgoing Felix editor in the last issue, and as one of the general no-lifers and\npermanent fixtures of the office, I 've been nabbed as one of i he men to do the job. Errn... what to say? OK, I 'll be methodical about it\n1. Comparison with Other Felix Editors I Have Known\nThat only gives me Owain (last year) to compare to. Very different! More prone\nRachel has been very successful this year in getting on with - and talking to and I 've been very impressed with the long-term attitude she has taken to mon\nFolly in the past, but this year I think Rachel has left a positive mark on Felix Oi\nupon us, and Rachel has also spent a huge amount of time ensuring that the Hand\n2. General Compliments on Character, Style and Punctuality\nRachel is - when not doing twenty things at once - one of the most disarming!/ friendly people I have come to know at Imperial. She's coped\nwith having to justify and defend Felix under attack from some quite hideously rude and two-faced people this year (no names) and managed\nto do so politely (although it's just as well they don't hear what happens when they leave the room).\nRachel is very supportive of her Felix 'lackeys' and has had to perform emotional open-heart surgery more than once this year. She's been\nmore than just an Editor, but a great friend to many people, and I doubt whether I would have survived this year without her.\n3. But is She a Babe?\nUndoubtedly.\nMark Baker\nSo you read Felix this year - what did you think the person who organised it was like? Did you read those editorials and think \"My God,\nwhat the heck are they on?\" Or wonder at the belief that things could change? Or maybe you didn't even realise that Felix has a full time edi-tor.\nWhat many people don't recognise is the job's isolation, something that I still find incredible. The trouble is that when the Editor has to spend\nthe vast majority of their time cooped up in a dreary office (as much as they may try to get out) the public all too often consists of the minority\nof readers who come in to complain.\nPositive reaction from students or staff had a similar positive effect on Rachel as it did on last year's editor. As the year progressed it was\nfrightening to see how Rachels reactions to events became so similar to her predecessor's. Perhaps seventy-plus hours a week in this office has\nan effect that is impossible to withstand.\nBut can it be a year since Rachel bounded down the stairs in the Union ecstatic at her decisive victory in the elections? It seems like another lifetime when we were planning those hustings speeches which filled me with terror. Like everything else that resulted from her election, she\nmanaged to take it all in her stride. There is no doubt though that her time as Editor has had significant effects on Rachel, not all of them things\nthat she might have liked. I suspect that it may be quite some time before Rachel is seen around the Union, or in College at all, after July.\nDisillusionment with vast tracts of College, the Union ana journ C ii fsm seems to have increased as the year has progressed;;:\nFor those of us left, it is sad that Rachel feels so strongly about getting out of Imperial since it was here that most of us met her. There aren't many people who can talk Irish politics and organised religion in an inebriated state and still vaguely make sense.\nAndrew Dorman-Smith\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH1996. NINE\nSir Ronald Oxburgh\nspoke to Rachel\nWalters of his\nperspective on\nImperial over the\npast year.\nanyone. I see myself bringing what experience\nI have of universities, in different parts of this\ncountry, in different parts of the United\nStates, and in different parts of Europe, to a massive national problem. In looking at the\ncomposition of the committee, no doubt\nthose who set it up tried to make sure that\nthere was sufficient breadth of experience, so\nthat all important aspects of the problem\nwould be looked at. I have a particular affinity toward research orientated universities.\nEveryone is selected bringing their own experience, but that's different from representing\na particular group.\nI think the principal uncertainties of the\nyear are external... these are the things we are\nexposed to when we have really only one\nlump-money sensitive customer for the\ngreater part of our services, which is the\nGovernment. The really dramatic reductions\nin funding is absolutely amazing: student\nfinancing has dropped by about 25% in real\nterms over the last decade.\nI suppose, fundamentally, I would like to\nsee a system where tertiary education was a basic right for those who wanted it. But the\neconomic situation and the rapid expansion of\nhigher education makes this an unreal is able objective. Under those circumstances, my\nown personal preference, without having seen\nany of the alternatives, is for some sort of\ngraduate tax on those who benefit. It would\nneed to be spread over a longish period, and\ndelayed until they were sufficiently well\nestablished to pay it - in other words they had\nactually seen some benefit from higher education in terms of salary increase. But the difficulty is that it is very unattractive to politicians, because they wouldn't see the benefit\nof it for ten years.\nThe Chancellor is concerned about the\npublic sector borrowing requirement, and\nwhat you are talking about would put a big\nloan on the PSBR. So what a government that\nwent that way would do, would be to actually set up something first class, the benefits of\nwhich would be felt by two governments\ndown the line. Although it's probably the\nright thing for the country, it's not necessarily something that is immediately appealing\nfor a government with a financial problem.\nIt's not a simple problem. But these are the\nproblems we have to look at.\nThe Rector's year\nSo how was it for you? What events stand out\nin Sir Ronald Oxburgh's199596? In the year as a whole a number of great\nthings happened, but I think winning\nUniversity Challenge was really great, probably giving the college a greater shot in the arm\nthan many other changes. What delighted me\nwas not only that they won, but that all sorts\nof people said to me, \"What a nice group!\"\nPeople who didn't know the College were\nrooting for them to win because they were\nsuch decent people. I thought that was\ntremendous; looking back on the year that has\nWinning University\nChallenge probably\ngave the College a greater shot in the\narm than many\nother changes\nto be one of the highlights.\nLooking back earlier, we finally got agreement from the various medical institutions to\njoin us, then obtained the funding for the new\nbuilding, getting over \u00a340 million for it. At\nthe same time, we were able to attract a first\nclass principal for the new medical school,\npoaching him from Edinburgh, and then got\nplanning permission to then get everything\nunderway. Of course, this medical school,\nthere are going to be big problems with it: any\ninitiative which brings together tribes with\ndifferent customs: everyone's customs are\nlong-cherished, and dearly held: the problem\nis they are all different! So melding this group\ninto a coherent working whole, but on the\nother hand finding a way of not submerging\ntheir individuality is a challenge.\nThe overwhelming impression that\ncomes across from a conversation with\nthe Rector on the future of Imperial\nCollege is that, while we're certainly\nnot short of ideas for improvement,\nwe are sadly lacking in the capital to\nrealise them. In the course of an hour\nwe discussed building new halls of\nresidence, expanding the sports centre\nand the Union, redesigning the inside\nof Sherfieid to make better use of the\nspace, landscaping the Imperial\nCollege Road and Queen's Lawn area\nand building a car park in Dalby\nCourt. The potential sources of funding ranged from the National Lottery\nand Medical Research Charities to the\nPrivate Finance Initiative and the\nMillennium Fund. He described the\nBMS building as the last of its kind,\nsimply because it will be built with\n\u00a340million from the Higher Education\nFunding Council. The other major project underway, the refurbishment of\nthe library, will be largely funded by a bequest.\nI imagine Imperial is hardly alone\namongst universities by appearing to\nbe an institution deprived of the freedom to determine its own destiny,\nscrabbling for finances to realise its\ngoals.\n\n"

The RCS II Building\nOut (eventually): RCS II\nEvery year a number of subjects\nseem to reappear in Felix with\nsuch regularity that you wonder\nif they will ever disappear. Last\nyear it was the unending spree of\ncomputer thefts and the on-off-on NUS referendum. This time\nCollege estates developments\ndominated the news.\nWhile the proposed extension to the IC's boat club premises at Putney may have been one\nbuilding project which featured\nprominently, it was another of\nthe Estates projects which really\nshone out as the issue that could\nnot be avoided in 1995/6.\nIC had been fortunate to\nobtain adequate funding for a new Imperial School of\nMedicine, but the logistics of the\nscheme didn't appear to follow as\nhappily. As meaty arguments\nbetween the constituent medical\nschools and College continued\nover the provision of social space,\nplanning applications were causing concern. The old RCS II\nbuilding should have been demolished by Christmas 1995, but it\nwas still standing three months\nlater. English Heritage weighed\nin because the site was a designated 'Conservation Area', and it\nwas mid-March before 'Green\nLight for BMS' graced the front\npage of Felix.\nWe were told of a wall of\nsilence from college authorities as\nthey plotted and planned in an\nattempt to wrest ICU from its\ngrip on the high revenue potential\nof Beit Quad. Since Biology\nwould be departing to enter the\nnew Biomedical building, the\nlogic was that ICU should follow\nthe botanists and zoologists out\nof the way, but this time into the\nsumptuous surroundings provided by the Sherfield building.\nICU sabbaticals and officials\nwere not particularly receptive to\nCollege overtures, with one\n'senior official' suggesting that\nthere would be a staff sit-in if any\npressure was brought to bear to\nvacate the Quad. In what was to\nbe the first of many incisive quotations Sarah White, the then\nnewly elected President, said that\nshe was \"extremely cross.\"\nCommunication started to\nimprove with an \"amicable yet\nfrank meeting\" between the\nDirector of Estates Ian Caldwell,\nand the four ICU sabbaticals. But\nit seemed that rising costs had\nmore to do with College's eventual decision to put the plans 'on\nhold' than ICU's preferences.\nStill on the ICU agenda was the\nadoption by College of the 'Beit\nOption', enabling the Union to\nexpand into some of the space\nvacated by the Biology\nDepartment.\nElsewhere on campus,\npreparations for the new library\nextension began with the appropriate degree of controversy. The\nfirst stage of the developments,\nexcavating the concrete-filled\nbasement, un tactfully started as\nthe third-term exam season got\nunderway. \"We think the worst is\nover,\" the Rector said.\nIn: rubble and building sites\n2. Rag\nRichard Willis, elected as Rag\nChair at the AGM in June 1995,\nopened his year with a blustering\nattack on the return without\ncompensation of a pilfered mas-co try item. 'It's a bloody dis-grace' he shouted as Felix showed\nReggie, King's College stone lion,\nbeing handed back by the Royal\nCollege of Science.\nThe Rag man had barely settled into his new job when he\nhimself graced the front cover\nwith a report that he had given\naway whisky and vodka at a fresher's reception. The matter\nwas highlighted when one inebriated newcomer was found in a 'barely conscious state' by a College official. Happily the student recovered.\nMr Willis was less fortunate\nas he found himself subject to the\nfull force of the disciplinary\nmight of the Union, brought on\nin part by the embarrassment\ncaused by the incident. While a technicality and an appeal looked\nlike delaying his departure, the\nRag Chair eventually preempted\nthe outcome of the censure\nOut: the heady days of charitable success\nmotions by resigning.\nIt was just two weeks later\nthat they were once again in the\nheadlines, this time with even\nworse news. A missing \u00a3300 was\nthe subject of this latest controversy as the rudder less group\nstruggled to come to terms with\n\"the mentality of someone who\nwould steal from charity.\"\nJon Lambert took the helm,\nwithout a noticeable improvement to the group's fortunes.\nThere was an incredibly poor\nturnout at the normally boisterous Mines Dirty Disco as part of\na similarly disappointing Rag\nWeek. Even the famous Beer\nFestival, a highlight in many IC\nstudent calendars, was under\nsubscribed as the trend continued. The final nail in the coffin of\nwhat must be one of their less\nauspicious years came with the\nIn: the lonely life of an\nex-Rag chair\nRag Fete at the end of May. This\nhas traditionally been held on the\nQueen's Lawn to show appreciation to those who have campaigned throughout the year and\nto raise even more money. With\nrain forcing the event inside, the\ncrowds failed to materialise with\na pitiful six students visiting the\nstands - a miserable end to a miserable year for Rag.\n\n"

So I'm afraid to say that\nbefore I had even seen this film I had decided\nthat I was not going to like it. But seeing it didn't change my mind at all.\nThankfully, I managed to drag a friend along\n(with a sense of humour), who pointed out that\nit did have some good points. The film revolves\naround the unconventional life of Roy Munsen\n(Woody Harrelson), an ex-bowler with only one\nhand.\nAt a time in his life when he is particularly\ndown on both luck and money, Roy stumbles\nupon Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), who seems\nto share his enthusiasm and talent for the game.\nHe decides to coach Ishmael for a tournament in\nReno which, if he wins, will make them both\nrich.\ncelluloid guide:\nHowever, to his horror, Roy discovers that\nIshmael is Amish and wants nothing to do with\nhim.

Since the family has financial problems,\nand will lose the farm if they don't come up with\nenough money to pay off their debts, he finally\ngives in, in the hope of returning home as a hero.\nOn their way to Reno, this unlikely pair\nmanage to pick up a beautiful companion called\nClaudia (Vanessa Angel]. Although things go\nwrong from that point onwards, the film still\nmanages to have a happy ending: Roy and\nClaudia fall madly in love, and drive off into the\nsunset together.\nI could summarise this film in a few words:\nBoring, stupid, pointless and totally unbelievable.\nAs my friend said, \"She'd never have fallen for\nhim in real life\". I admit that some parts are\nalmost funny, but that's the nicest thing I can say.\nfilm: back of beyonc L \u00ab\nThis film, set in the Australian middle of\nnowhere, is worth seeing due to the beautiful\nscenery and the watch able characters. However,\nwhen it comes to a well-paced plot or good dia-logue, it fails noticeably.\nInstead of what could have been a powerful\ndepiction of Aborigine dreamtime, it delivers ac liche ridden romantic slush. By the time we get\nto the supposedly meaningful revelation at the\nend, it is not so much a surprise as an explanation\nof the artifices of the plot. It is more of a surprise\nthat a very Australian film puts an Irish band -the Cranberries - as the closing track.\nDespite the criticisms, the film is watch able due to the stark landscapes and the relatively\ngood acting of otherwise dire lines. One of the\nfinancial backers of this film was the Australian\nTourist Board, which may explain a lot.\ntheatre: who shall be happy\n.HIrian thurston-gordon\nIf not everyone, who shall be happy? This is the\nquestion asked by playwright Trevor Griffiths,\nregarding the imprisonment and subsequent\nunlawful execution of Danton and who and\nwhat he represented in the triumvirate of the\nFrench Revolution. Danton, plausibly played by\nStanley Townsend, is held in prison guarded by\nHenry (Kuluinder Ghir) and he tries to convince\nthis simple guard to carry a coded letter to his\nwife, in order to be rescued. Henry may be\nsimple but he's not stupid, and he plays along,\nallowing Danton to bribe him with ever\nincreasing sums.\nDanton has been placed in solitary confinement in one prison, whilst an actor pretending to\nbe Danton has been placed in another prison to\nconfuse the many would be 'springer'. Our pris-one r, pretends to be the actor, in an attempt to\nconvince Henry that his letter in innocuous.\nHowever, when Henry apparently starts to\nbelieve that Danton really is the actor, Danton is\nincensed and starts to act the part of Danton\nwith passion to prove that he really is the liberator of the people. Henry plays another game\nwith Danton, and he asks him to act some more.\nDanton claims that to continue would make\nhim cry, but Henry tricks him into a further presentation because he hopes that this prisoner\ntruly is Danton. Henry shares the same revolutionary dream that he heard Danton expound,\nyears ago.\nThe set, lighting and design is as excellent as\nthe directing and writing, but this story doesn't get to the heart of the Revolutions problem\nwhich was not, \"Who shall be happy?\" but who\nshall be 'unhappy'. It was a question of ideological vision, tantamount to the rise and demise of\na culture and a people and consequently a nation.\nHl~l137434? \u2022 S S^f iy;;^.':./!

    "content": "NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY 26TH JUNE 1 9 9 6 . FIVE\nKarian resigned to no confidence\nULU President quits to preempt QMW motion\nBY ROBIN RILEY\nThe University of London Union\npresident Ghassan Karian tendered his resignation in a letter to\nthe University of London Union\nGeneral Union Council on\nTuesday, pre-empting a vote of\nno confidence in his presidency.\nMr Karian had partially withdrawn from the presidency much\nearlier, on May 17th, when he\naccepted the offer of a position as\nWest London elections campaigns co-or d in at or for the\nLabour Party. Ghassan was continuing his administrative duties\nas president, but was no longer\ndrawing a salary from ULU. The\napparent conflict of interest led\ndelegates from Queen Mary and\nWestfield College led to the proposal of no confidence in the\npresident.\nDissent was strongest at\nQMW following an incident earlier in the year when Ghassan\nfiercely criticised their NUS conference delegates, who had been\nmandated to support his New\nSolutions (for funding higher\neducation) proposal, but ignored\ntheir mandates and voted against.\nIn retaliation, QMW students\nvoted to ban Mr Karian from\ntheir Union premises.\nSpeaking to Felix, QMW\nsabbatical Anthony Hume questioned Ghassan's motives in\npushing through both 'New\nSolutions' and the new ULU con-st it uti on, in light of his new pos i tion. He also expressed anger at\nMr Karian's lack of accountability\nto the students he represented,\nwho had been paying his wages\nfor at least the majority of the\nyear. More specific complaints\nincluded Ghassan's refusal to call\na GU C meeting until forced, his\ncontravening of the ULU constitution in holding the two jobs at\nonce, and his failure to give the\nrequired one month's notice\nbefore resigning.\nThese arguably trivial complaints may have led to Ghassan's description of QMWs Union\nofficers as \"petty politicians, who\nhave nothing better to do than\ngrind their axe,\" (Felix 1061) but\nMr Hume was adamant: \"We\nhold the moral high ground, I feel, without a shadow of a doubt.\"\nIn Ghassan Karian's absence,\nULU Vice-President Tara\nJefferson has stepped in as acting\npresident until the end of July, in\na brief interview with Felix, Ms\nJefferson was downbeat and\nexpressed her frustration at the\ncourse of events, claiming \"It was\nbrilliant when he was doing the\nwork and not getting paid... We\nwere getting maximum value out\nof Ghassan.\" Ms Jefferson went\non to express her dismay at Mr\nKarian's forced resignation, and\ndenied rumours that she too\nwould resign.\nConcerning the objections\nraised by QMWs Union officers\nregarding Ghassan's policies now\nthat he was working for Labour,\nMs Jefferson said \"Perhaps they\nshould have tried harder to win\nthose arguments at the time.\"\nHowever, when pushed on\nwhether Mr Karian's overt political affiliation was appropriate,\nMs Jefferson conceded that the\nother ULU sabbaticals were all\neither apolitical or Labour Party\nmembers themselves.\nUnder the UL U const it u tion, the motion of no confidence\nstill had to be discussed at the\nGU C meeting even though\nGhassan's resignation rendered\nthe result entirely academic.\nIronically, the motion was defeated by the narrow margin of two\nvotes, so Mr Karian would have\nremained UL U president had he\nnot resigned. However, Anthony\nHume, the motion's original pro-poser, claims that if this had been\nthe case, stronger arguments for\nsacking Ghassan would have been\nput forward and the result would\nhave been radically different.\nThe repercussions of Mr\nKarian's resignation may well\ncontinue into the next academic\nyear. Sarah White, ICU president and UL U president elect,\nwill be denied the usual handover\nperiod of training by the outgoing\npresident. This could conceivably\nknock-on to the incoming ICU\npresident, Eric Allsop.\nUltimately perhaps only\nGhassan Karian himself can claim\nany victory from these proceed-in gs, as his rapid rise within the\nLabour Party seems assured\ndespite the souring of his term as\nULU president.\nChina to England by tandem for IC duo\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nAn expedition by a post-doctoral\nresearcher and her boyfriend who\ncycled from China to England\nreached its conclusion a few\nweeks ago when the couple finally arrived to a champagne reception in Ramsgate.\nDave Montain, a technician\nin the Physics Department, initially received the suggestion\nfrom his girlfriend Bronwen with\nsurprise. Bronwen was nearing\nthe end of a year's research in\nthe Chinese capital, Beijing, and\nwanted to take the opportunity\nto do something adventurous.\n\"I'd been saving up for something like this for a while,\" Dave\nrecalls, \"but when Bron suggested\nit, I was a little surprised.\" - neither of the pair are dedicated\ncyclists. The idea grew on him\nand he attended a course on bike\nbuilding, and built their own tan-dem.\nFor the first month of their\nyear-long trip they stayed in\nBeijing, then headed south\nthrough Vietnam, across to Nepal\nDave and Bronwen met a Pakistani homeopathic doctor who cycled\naround the world in the sixties.\nand India. They travelled through\nPakistan and Iran, which Dave\ndescribed as \"brilliant\" and somewhere he would like to go back\nto, and then to Turkey. Everyone\nthey met on their travels was\nfriendly, and willing to help the\nunusual travellers. It seemed that\neverywhere they went they\nattracted attention, and were\noften chased by curious locals. In\none Indian town they nearly\ncaused a riot as onlookers crowded around.\nWhen they reached Europe,\nthey found that this feeling of\nbeing 'special' soon wore off, but\nthey were glad nonetheless when\nthey disembarked the cross-chan-nel ferry at Ramsgate and were\ngreeted by Bronwen's parents\nwith champagne.\n\n"

We\nwould like to thank STOIC for\nsending the tape in and selflessly\ntaking all the praise on our behalf.\nWe must all congratulate\nSTOIC on their success as so many\nunscrupulous people these days\nwould not ask the band before\nentering a video of one of their\ngigs into a competition now would\nthey?\nUrban Spice (Simon Wilkins,\nStefan Finch, Rick Aldred, John\nMartin, Russel Stothard)\nP.S. Do you know they\ncharged us \u00a310 for a copy of the\nvideo too!\nDear Felix,\nI am extremely disappointed at the\nquality of your news reports. The\narticle on the Iranian Society ban\nin last week's Felix (issue 1061)\nwas full of inaccuracies, misrepresentations and even spelling mis-takes.\nFirst of all, I am not sure what\nyour news team mean by the \"in ci dent in the Huxley building\".\nDespite hot weather, poor air conditioning system and a late start\nimposed by the college security,\nthe lecture went extremely\nsmoothly, and no particular \"in ci dent\" took place.\nSecondly, I found your\ndescription of Dr Soroush (not\nSonosh!) as someone who \"is\nknown to Scotland Yard\" extremely offensive and derogatory. Dr\nSoroush is an internationally\nrenowned thinker and philosopher\nwho has been invited to some of\nthe most prestigious academic\ninstitutions in Europe and North\nAmerica. In any case, the fact that\nhe spoke here at Imperial College\ncan only add to the college's international reputation.\nI very much hope that, in\nfuture, greater care is taken fo\nensure that college news is reported accurately and without dist or tion.\nYours sincerely,\nA member of the audience\n(Name withheld by request)\nDear Felix,\n'We are sensitive to exam pressures, although some students\nmay not believe that.' Ian Caldwell\nis so sensitive to exam pressures\nthat as Head of Estates he allows\nthe library to be taken over by\nworkmen intent on making the life\nof those studying inside a misery.\nConsiderable numbers of students were so disrupted in their\nstudy over Easter Vacation by the\nhorrendous drilling beneath\nSouthside that some of them had\nto be given a second room in\nWeeks Hall. Maybe the fact that\nthey have been monetarily recompensed leads Ian to the conclusion\nthat he is 'sensitive' to student\nneeds.\nThe latest, and most sickening incident of college's blatant\ndisregard for students is the\nrecently exposed 'Week's in ci dent'. It just happened that work\nstarted at 8am each day and that\na 'Let's impress the high and\nmighty' event was due to occur a few days later. The story may have\nbeen believable at the time, but\nhow is the dispassionate Director\nof Estates going to live this one\ndown?\nIf he is willing to stand up for\nwhat he did - and justify it - then\nmaybe he deserves to be listened\nto, otherwise the man is exposed\nas a fraud. At the very least Felix\nshould investigate every word of\nwhat he says before believing that\nthe man is ever out for students\nrather than his precious VIP's and\nthe plaudits of His Royal Highness\nthe Rector.\nYours,\nDisgusted of Southside\n(name wit held by request)\nDear Rachel,\nCOMMEMORATION DAY 1996 -CHANGE OF DATE\nPlease note that the date of\nCommemoration Day this year has\nhad to be changed from Thursday\n24 October to Thursday 31\nOctober due to the Albert Hall\nbeing unavailable on the earlier\ndate.\nYours Sincerely,\nJackie Sweet\nAssistant Registrar\na) One last irritable snipe back\nat the enemy\nThere are a few final ends to\ntie up: the Warden of Selkirk\nand Tizard Halls was quoted in\nan ambiguous context last week,\nfor which I apologise. When he\nsaid that \"there is no security in\nHalls other than that which the\nstudents provide themselves\" I think he was trying to say that\nwe are all responsible for those\nwe let in. He was certainly not\nexpressing any lack of confidence in security staff. But I have to say, Dr Hassard, that I would feel much more inclined\nto offer an apology if I had got\nthe complaint directly from\nyourself, rather than second\nhand.\nb) Luwie tear-jerk er Mum and Dad: thank you\nfor supporting me through it. I promise I 'll get a proper job now.\nInky: it's been fabulous.\nc) Straight forward apology\nI'm sorry: I tried to meet\nthe students' complaint of \"too\nboring!\" and the staff complaint\nof \"too sensationalist!\" and failed\nat both. I'm moving on now -time for someone else to have a go-maybe you all had very high\nexpectations for what is still just\na students' newspaper. If the\nIranian Society speaker's name\nwas misspelt, maybe it was\nbecause someone spent hours\ntrying to track down a knowledgeable source before giving up\nto go to his Aeronautics lecture\ninstead. We're tried our best.\ne) Bid for freedom\nLook, lighten up, will you? If\nyou're not going to take it all\nwith a pinch of salt and a healthy\nset of expectations, then I'm off.\nUp north to make girders lor\nBritish Steel, actually. Wouldn't touch journalism with a ten-foot\nbarge pole ever again.\nI) Littlc-kid-meets-VIP awe\nThere was something\ntremendously inspiring about\nmeeting the Rector. Somehow,\nand I don't know how, he made\nme feel really proud to be part of\nthis tremendous institution.\ng) Genuine nostalgia\nI'm very, very tired right\nnow, but I'm still not looking forward to saying goodbye to it all.\nI 've had superb fun... and you\nknow, there are bits of it I'm quite proud ol.\nd) Pathos-laden bid for the sym- h) All of the above,\npath y vote\nIt's been really, really diff i Thanks for bearing with me.\ncult, and at the end of the day\nEDITORIAL TEAM: NEW S:ALE XFE A KES FEATURES: MARK BAKER SUB EDITING: TIM ST CLAIR MUSIC: VI KB AN SAL CINEMA: WEI LEE PHOTOGRAPHY: IVAN CHAN PUZZLES: CATFISH ARTS: JEREMY SCIENCE: BEN WILKINS none!: MARK, TIM, JEREMY, ALEX, ROBIN, JON& MARK H COLLATING LAST WEEK: ALEX, MARK, GIDON AND ROBIN "

FELIX WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH1996 NEWS\nCommemoration Day \"blunder\"\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nImperial College's1996 Commemoration Day celebrations were salvaged from disaster\nlast week when they were\nrescheduled for the 31st October, instead of the 24th. The Registry Division responsible\nfor the ceremony had overlooked\na mistake in the booking of the\nAlbert Hall in what was\ndescribed by the Rector, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, as a \"gross blu n der. \"\nCommemoration Day, when\ngraduating students receive their\ndegrees, is traditionally held on\nthe closest Thursday to the 25th of October, which allows the\nAlbert Hall to be booked for the\nevent years in advance. However,\nthis year the graduation ceremony is pencilled in for the 31st October instead of the 24th, a fact that nobody in Registry discovered until recently, when\npreparations for the ceremony\nand the Ball following it were\nwell under way.\nIn particular, invitations to\nthe event had already been sent\nout, and Imperial College Union\nPHOTO: WILLIAM LORENZ Proud parents photographing their son at this year's post-graduate\nceremony. October's Commemoration Day for undergraduates has\nbeen the victim of a \"gross blunder,\" nearly scuppering the event.\nhave had to move the \u00a390 a pair\nCommemoration Ball forward a week. ICU narrowly avoiding a repeat of the May Post-graduate\nBall debacle in which they\nincurred a penalty for cancellation at short notice due to another Registry mistake.\nEfforts were made by the\nRegistry to solve the problem,\nbut they were unable to move the\ndate to the 24th October. Speaking to Felix, Vernon Mclure, head\nof the Registry Division since the\nbeginning of May, confirmed that\nthey had made efforts to \"sort it\nout,\" but plans to move the event\nto the 24th were scotched when\na pop group booked into the Hall\nfor the week before were unable\nto move. Questions remain,\nthough, as to why three weeks\nwent by after the blunder's discovery before Registry notified\nanybody of their mistake.\nThe Rector was told last\nWednesday, and apparently\nunimpressed by the situation\ndeclared that \"those who [made\nthe mistake] would have to sort it\nout.\" Sarah White, ICU pre si dent, described the affair as \"very\nunfortunate\" and said that it was\n\"lucky that it happened in time\nfor the students that were lea v ing,\" though it was too late for\noverseas students.\nICU sources put the cost of\nthe Commemoration Ball in the\nregion of \u00a315,000, which is normally covered by the double ticket price of \u00a390. However, it is\nnow doubtful whether or not the\noverheads of the Ball will be met\nfrom ticket sales alone. Sarah\nWhite, incredulous that the\nRegistry had made yet another\nmistake, suggested that some of\nthe cost of the Ball may be passed\non to the Registry.\nLSE moves to top-up fees\nAthletic Clubs Committee\nColour Awards\nThe following people have been\nawarded colours for their sporting achievement.\nBoat: Full- A.

Nutt\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nIn a move marked as a \"sad day\nfor students,\" the London School\nof Economics' academic board\nvoted to recommend the principle of top-up fees to its governing\nbody as a way to reduce a predicted \u00a33.7 million deficit.\nIf implemented, the LSE\nwould become the first universit-ty in the UK to charge top-up\ntuition fees for EU students. The\nvote, 43 for and 12 against,\nreverses an earlier decision not to\nsupport the fee.\nEstimates for the size of the\nfee have ranged from a preliminary figure of \u00a3850 to a \u00a33500\ncharge which would recover the\nSchool's budget deficit. Other,\nshort term measures had also\nbeen agreed by the academic\nboard, including raising the fees\nfor overseas students and reducing staffing costs by 4%.\nClaire Lowrie, LSESU's treasurer, commented that\n\"Tuition fees should be an option\nof the very last resort,\" and suggested that poorer students and\nthose from less privileged backgrounds would be put off coming\nto university. However, the\nDirector of LSE, John Ashworth,\nsaid that \"as [LSE] are an internationally renowned centre of\nexcellence, we must not let our\nreputation be damaged by the\nreduction of state funding.\"\nImperial College officials\nhave consistently denied that IC\nwould begin to charge top up\nfees. However, it remains to be\nseen whether the London School\nof Economics' move will start a domino effect of high-flying universities succumbing to top-up\nfees, and whether or not Imperial\nCollege will be able to resist\nthese pressures.\n\n"

It\n| had occurred to me, while tweaking the news\nI pages late one Wednesday evening a few weeks\nbeforehand, that what people read in Felixwhat I was writing or editing - must make an imp res: sion. This was borne out when, after knocking on doors and relating my breathless:\nIf banter, the occupants would ask me questions, wanting to know more.\nThis primitive 'meeting the public' exercise was very satisfying, and reassured\nline that the enormous number of Felixes that we distribute each week weren't just : : :\nf picked up by cleaners. It showed that people were reacting, taking in what was reported, and II\nI ruminating on what piqued their interest. In a way, they were taking part in their Felix, keeping I their end of the unwritten, unspoken contract between the writers here and the eclectic masses\n|beyond the office doors.\nAnd that process is mirrored every time they move to pen a letter or tap a key, allowing them toil\nparticipate in the production side of Felix, stepping across the invisible line that marks out the read-ft\n|ers from the producers in the relationship. Some have been moved to come and see lor themselves,\n|trying their hand at a review, picking up a news-assignment, reporting on a hockey match or what ev| jer - they are engaging themselves in Felix, and reflect a little ol themselves into the reading.\nSo the reader-mannequin a quires a bit of life in its perusal of Felix.

    "content": "Fancy a trip to the >in\nvirtual jungle?\nBy Ben Wilkins and Tony Heenan\nImagine trying to carry out your scientific\nresearch in a tropical jungle: forty degree\nheat, high humidity, snakes, insects etc.\nThe logistical problems involved would\ndeter all but the most intrepid of scientists. But\nwhat if the field operation was connected to the\ninternet? Wouldn't it be possible for many of the\nresearchers to stay at home, remain in the comfort of their offices and\ntake part in the field operation exclusively via the information super-highway? The only problem now is how on earth do you set up and\nmaintain an internet link in the middle of a jungle...?\nft\nWhat do two aeronautical engineers, a bio-chemist, a materials sci-ent is t,a physicist, a Venezuelan entomologist and a lap-top computer have in common? Give up? Well, they\nare all about to embark on a unique expedition\nto study butterfly populations and the Orinoco\nriver in Southern Venezuela.\nWhat makes this venture, called\nNetspedition, unique is that they will be using\nthe latest in portable computer and satellite\ntechnology to transmit each day's results and\ntheir experiences to Imperial. Back at IC, a support team will release the data onto the\nNetspedition web page. Netspedition was the\nbrainchild of Matthew Lewis, one ofthe six who\nwill be going this summer. \"The main idea was\nto go on an expedition. I 've always been an\nInternet fanatic, and I wanted to find a way to\ncombine the two.\"\nAfter landing at Caracas, the expedition ers will meet up with the sixth member, the entomologist from the University \u2022 \u2022\nof Zulia in Venezuela. The six 5\n^\n^\n^\nJ_J_ will then hire a bush plane\nwhich will take them as far up\nthe Orinoco River as possible.\nFrom there, they will open\ntheir rucksacks and unpack\nthree 18-foot fold able canoes,\npaid for by the Harlington\nTrust. They will then travel by\ncanoe along along the river\nthrough a remote area the size\nof Wales. In total the team will\nspend six weeks together\naway from civilisation. The primary goal of the expedition is to show that it is possible to transmit from the jun-g le. To do this the team will be\nusing a lap top computer and a 'sat phone' - a$35,000 mobile\nphone which was lent to them\nby California Microwave.\nAccording to Tony Heenan,\nusing it couldn't be easier:\n\"You open the box, unfold the satellite dish and\naway you go.\"\nAlong the way the team will measure characteristics of the river such as temperature, pH\nand conductivity. Simple chemical analysis will\nbe used to determine the levels of salinity, hardness and nutrients in the water. The idea to\nstudy butterfly species diversity came from an\nex IC student, now at the Open University, who\nread about the expedition on the Internet. The\nteam will be studying how the local conditions\nsuch as light, and river parameters affect the.\nspecies diversity. All their results will be fed into\nthe computer, along with their location, as given\nby their satellite global positioning system.\nScientists from all over the world will be able to\nanalyse the results and feed back comments, to\nthe group. Tony Heenan believes this technology could \"open up new methods of remote\nresearch on a global scale.\" \u2022\nBefore the team can start to study the butterfly population, they will have to catch them.\nThese days this is a lot more sophisticated than\nrunning round the jungle with nets. Instead they\nwill use something called a fruit trap, which is\nbasically a14 inch plate -covered with rotting\nfruit with a net above it. Those butterflies which\nfind rotting fruit irresistible will be caught\nwhen they try to fly\naway. Unfortunately,\n90% of butterflies don't like fruit. So how will\nthe team catch these? \"By mn ning around the\njungle with nets,\" says Tony Heenan.\nBut he stresses that these experiments are\nby no means trivial: \"You don't demonstrate the\npotential of this technology if you do Mickey\nMouse science... As far as we can tell, nobody\nhas been there for the express purpose of studying butterfly populations before. People just\ndon't know what's there. The chances are we'll\ncome across maybe a dozen new species.\"\nIf the team find a species which is new to\nthem, they will send images of the live butterfly\nto the collaborating scientists who will try to\nidentify it. Eventually the specimens collected\nfrom the Orinoco will end up in the Natural\nHistory Museum and the Museo de Artropodos\nin the University of Zulia.\nAlong with the scientific objectives,\nNetspedition intends to be the first truly interactive expedition on the Internet. As the team\njourneys through the Amazon, sounds, images\nand video of the flora and fauna, the diverse animal life and of the scenery of what is one of the\nmost beautiful regions on this planet, will be\ndigitised using a CCD camera and the multimedia facilities of the lap-top.. This information,\nalong' with a continuously updated log of their\ndaily life, will be released onto the Web site. It\nwill be possible to e mail the expedition team,\nask them questions and help them with any simple decisions they might face.\nWould you like to get involved in\nNetspedition? The team are still looking for students and staff to help maintain the Web site\nand also provide scientific support to the team in\nthe field. Why not check out the web site at:\nhttp://sun site. doc.ic.ac.uk/nets p edition and\nthen get in contact\nwith the relevant team\nmember. Join us if you\ndare...\n\n"

    "content": "album: the blue nile -peace at last, dick\nYour faith can be sorely tested when the sign\nyou've been waiting for is not quite all that you\nexpected. So it was with me when 'Hats' (The\nBlue Nile's second album) was released in 1989,\nsome six years after their first stunningly beautiful creation. The two now sit side by side, never\nfar from the CD player, the gap next to them\nwaiting to be filled by Paul Buchanan's next\nvision. And here it is, seven years on (and with\nonly one tour to their credit, where the religious\nfer v our of the audience was all-encompassing).\nBut what of this, the latest offering? Best\ndescribed as earthy, perhaps. The polish of the\nfirst two albums has been tarnished to a degree\nwhere the accompaniment for the first track,\n'Happiness', is a foot tapping on echoing floor-boards. And it works beautifully, growing into a rousing gospel praise-be.\nNever before have the drums been left so\nbarren of effects as on 'Love Come Down',\nrefreshing in their simplicity. Not that everything\non the album works; Holy Love' is the worst\nthing they've ever committed to tape, and\nthankfully short. Whilst the music is still largely\nre splenda nt, the lyrics are strangely limp. You\ncan only sing love and yeah yeah yeah so many\ntimes before it becomes pass e. Redemption comes in the form of 'God\nBless You Kid' and the obligatory sparsely-deco-rated 'Family Life'. These two are the true saviours but I now know from experience that the\nrest will reveal themselves in their own good\ntime.When a Blue Nile disciple hears the strains\nof 'Tinsel Town in the Rain' emanating from his neighbour's house, he is seen to nod sage ly belief is never more powerful than this. Only the\nmost hardened agnostic will not be swayed by at\nleast some part of this album. Go on... light a candle (8)\nsingles:,\nalbum: 808 state -don solaris e late 802, and tunes like 'Pat ifk and 'Lulnk' will\nalwa) si'\\ oke happy memories.

First up\nwas Octopus, who supported the Auteurs at\ntheir last London gig. They've improved vastly\nsince then; the trumpets have tightened up and\nthe lyrics are delivered with passion. The band\nplay fairly middling songs which tend to become\na little confusing at times, due to so many things\nhappening at once. It seems as if all the band\nmembers are playing a solo simultaneously.\nHaving said that, the final track of the set is the\nexcellent current single 'Your Smile' and the\nband leave on a high note.\nBy the time Longpigs come on, Brixton\nacademy has turned into a sweat box and the\nfrenetic moshi ng encouraged by Crispin and co.\ndoes little to cool the air. Brilliant renditions of\nthe brilliant tracks on a brilliant album makes the\nset, well, brilliant. The whole crowd join in with\nthat scream from 'She Said' and the band leave\nthe venue buzzing with excitement.\nI have to admit it, I thought Sleeper were\ngoing to be crap live. How wrong can you be?\nThe stage starts off in pitch darkness and suddenly guitarist Jon Stewart is illuminated by two\npiercing spotlights, frantically stm rrr ming the\nfirst chords from Dress Like Your Mother'. The\ndrums kick in and then Louise appears - the kids\ngo utterly bonkers. And this is just the start.\nLouise commands all the attention, scampering round the stage like a rabbit on speed, and\nmad-man drummer occasionally stands up to\nbeat the hell out of his kit. All this energy builds\nup into 'Inbetweener', the Sleeper anthem. The\ncrowd descend into total insanity - everyone in\nthe gig is po going up and down, including the\nth My something couples with their arms around\neach other. Most of the rest of the material is\nfrom 'The It Girl' but the old favourite\nDelicious' sends all the teenage lads into af ren zy, and one even makes it onto the stage.\nSleeper hammer through 'Sale of the\nCentury', 'Ue Detector', 'Good Luck Mr Gorsky' and several more until the set ends with\nthe loudest bit of feedback/random drumming I have ever heard. The encores were\n'Shrinkwrapped' and the band's debut single\nAlice', a blast from the past if ever I heard one.\nThat's how wrong I was - top tunes, top\nlights, and a top bird - what more can you ask\nfor?\nManic Street Preachers, and the 'Pacdie'-esque\n'Joyrider', but the rest oi it is rather ll&ren tO, Almost every tune vom es oxer If ip oar mix tu people's work, sounding in turn\nlike Mike< )ld field, 'ah Wobble, AphexTwin and\nto emulating die craft of its 'influences', and just\nends up u rt*l and clich e fcd A hu> let-down (2)\n; 54;4:.30 5;\nV>9'< \u2022\n'\n[553'\n' .:Vr:Pp3lPsS*r. sp:;\n\u2022 0:055295055505 25 5555500:'\n\u2022 .M4i''J']i iM i7?4'4ii i4444:;1125t: \u00bbPl2 '.-.A0055555500:5.2ll ll| pj4 'ii\n4444:44i4i>::: M'M. s v'444'44005i44'i4 fi:44; \u2022 00\": '\u2022 ' -.)VP\n'ii is9.} ii:|295'2.'; J55 v55 o5.*0.5::.V joo i 'iii 0Mi iii251<: yo act\n44'4' y:5551 i::\\i;\":4*i. \u2022:\nW0.5.\nhen folds five v. here s: M44'X/ 'W4i:4i' M'5#V::4444'4' '\u2022vii44>444: \u2022 \u20225 \u2022\n44x fi \u00bb 44\u00a74M4'4]74M4:;A.}:4..

Up until recently, the fortunes of\nthe England football team had closely followed\nmy stunning success on the National Lottery.\nWhile I still throw money away on a weekly\nbasis, the expected upturn following the replacement of Anthea Turner by Bob Monkhouse having failed to materialise, the boys with three lions\non their shirts are now playing better than I can\never remember. The stunning demolition of the\nDutch last week was incredible, and the sound\nof Rule Brittania bellowing out of Wembley was\ndeeply moving, and now as tears subside, I find\nit all so amusing. To think they did all that, and\nmay I say, not in a shy way, that game will go\ndown as one of my greatest sporting memories,\nand I am sure I am not exaggerating. By the time\nyou read this we should be in the semi-finals,\nhaving despatched Spain, but let's not tempt\nfate. On the basis of their current form, they\ncould and should win it, which would give the\ncountry an incredible boost and remove the self-doubt that many have about Britain (or should\nthat be England, as my Celtic flat mate has\nobserved?). We can but hope.

It is frustrating that the debate in\nBritain is split between the extremes of monetary union or out, both of which are very damaging aims. We are accused of anti-European\nbehaviour over the beef ban, but let us not forget\nthe way that France helped prop up the entire\nGATT Agreement to secure what it wanted for\nits farmers, almost causing the collapse of five\nyears of painstaking negotiation. I refuse to take\nlectures on co-operation from countries whose\nself-interest is so fiercely defended regardless of\nanything.\nAnd that's yer lot, kids. May I thank everyone who has read my humble prose over the\nyear and especially those who have commented\non it with ideas, criticisms or praise. Oscar Wilde\nwas absolutely right about being talked about. It\nhas been very enjoyable and, I'd like to think,\nmade a few ripples on the Imperial pond.\nFor what is a man, what has he got, if not\nhimself then he has not.

What follows is not so\nmuch a list of favourites as a selection of recommendations, and if you notice a propensity\ntowards a certain genre, you are correct. I make\nno apologies.\nWhatever you read, have a good summer!\nIain Banks: The Crow Road\nThe 'archetypal' Scottish Novel, of a young man\nfinding his way and the settling of old family\nfeuds. A mixture of the macabre, black humour,\na few deaths, and an atypically upbeat ending\nmake a very readable novel.\nJohn Brunner: Stand on Zanzibar\nIf you want to understand the origin of 'road\nrage', then this chronicle of overcrowding is very\nconvincing. The unique style, which uses\nextracts from fictional books, takes a while to get\nused to, but pays off. And I wish there really was\na book called 'You're an Ignorant Idiot'.\nJohn Crowley: Little, Big\nSleep, dream and the lethargic pace of life are\nthe basis of this story of Faerie in the modem\nday. What really distinguishes this book are the\nembellished pages and the language: \"The room\nseemed larger than it was, or was smaller than it\nlooked, he couldn't decide which.\"\nSimon Ings: Hotwire\nSentient cities, manufactured organisms and\ntechnology-ambivalent societies are the scenery.\nThe foreground is a story of misunderstood love,\nand the blurring of the distinction between natural and manufactured.\nUrsula K. LeGuin: The Dispossessed\nThe story of one man's development of a metaphysical communication theory, set against the\njuxtaposition of two ideologically opposed soci-e ties. As each system tries to manipulate him, he\nbecomes convinced that neither is best. LeGuin\nargues that solutions are not found in ideals.\nNicholas Royle: Counterparts\nThe lives of an aspiring actor and a tightrope\nwalker are interwoven through dreams and\nother blurring s of reality- Although very readable,\nit's not for the squeamish.\nNeal Stephenson: The Diamond Age\nAlthough somewhat tongue-in-cheek, this novel\nof education in a high-nano tech, stratified society\nstill has real ideas to discuss.\nKurt Vonnegut: Slaughterhouse 5\nA man is forced to confront his memories of the\nDresden firebombing. The possibly heavy philosophy is digestible due to the self-deprecating\nstyle, and the \"so it goes\" refrain.\nRoger Zelazny: Doorways in the Sand\nAliens disguised as marsupials, a Mobius-twisting\nmachine and an eternal student. If you want\nweird and wacky, they don't come much more\nso than this.\n\n"

    "content": "EIGHT . FELIX WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH1996 FEATURE\nThe View of the Tower\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of Imperial\nCollege and Science, Technology and\nMedicine. A man with a lot to answer\nfor, I reckoned. It was to be an interview of tough questioning and hard-hitting journalism. But as soon as I was shown the tomato plants in grow\nbags on the balcony of his Sherfield\nbalcony, I fell apart. So here it is: our\nRector appeared to me as a sincere,\ncaring, enthusiastic and eminently\napproachable man who left me in no\ndoubt that at least part of the Powers\nthat Be really do care more than we\ngive them credit for.\nSo I apologise for the following:\nafter a year of this I'm blatantly in not\nmuch of a state to fight any more bat-tle s.I suspect that this man could have\neasily persuaded me that it would be\nbest for students to dig up the library\nat the start of the exam season every\nyear. Alarming, my predecessor wrote\nsomething similar last year, too.\nPerhaps it is simply that after a year of\never-mounting cynicism Sir Ronald\nOxburgh's honesty and frankness is\nrefreshingly straightforward. For one\nthing, of all the people in the Sherfield\nBuilding I have questioned over the\npast couple of years, the Rector is the\nfirst to admit to a mistake. He is certainly the only one to use the phrase\n'enormous cock-up,' although I think\nhe said to not quote him on that.\nEstates development\nI started well, asking whether the current\nestates developments, particularly the construction of the biomedical sciences building\nand excavation of the library during the exam\nperiod was indicative of a caring and sensitive\nstudent-focussed college. He had an answer for\neverything: the digging up of the library basement was, indeed, much noisier than anyone\nhad anticipated. Apparently the college\nrecords were incorrect, and the contractors\ncame across areas of solid concrete which were\nsimply not present in the plans. They then had\nno choice to bring in pneumatic drills. \"It\nbuilds character,\" he said, laughing, \"I live\nbeside it.\"\nWe haven't really got much choice, given\nthat the first medical intake arrives in\nOctober 1998. We have to have everything\nready at least six months in advance so that\nthe departments can be ready and so that the\nlibrary is set up - we can't have everything\nhalf finished and half done when the intake\narrives. You may think that people have been\nbadly inconvenienced - and they have - but\nnot half as badly as they could have been had\nwe not bent over backwards. We've spent an\nawful long time trying to schedule work in\nsuch a way that the inconvenience would be\nminimal. In a few cases that came unstuck,\nwhere it was outside our control.\nBut in some cases, on the grounds of student inconvenience, we have changed the\noverall plans. We have delayed the health\nSome of our halls of\nresidence, frankly,\nI'm ashamed of...\ncentre: we thought we had it planned in such\na way that it would give the best result all\nround, but what hadn't been recognised was\nthat the noise in the lower part of Southside\nwould transmit throughout the Southside\nstructure. Perhaps that should have been\nrecognised, but it wasn't foreseen. We had\nplanned to move the health centre across over\nthe summer, so that it would be up and running for next September. It won't be ready\nnow until sometime in the autumn term -there will be disruption in the service then.\nSo whatever you do, you're actually going to\nlose out somewhere or other. In the end, we\nhave to say, 'it's Hell for us, but won't it be\nnice for those who come after?'\nIt's going to be miserable for the next\nthree or four years. But we think the worst is\nover on the BMS site. There's going to be\nquite a bad period next year when enormous\ntankers and lorries are going backwards and\nforwards, pouring concrete on the structure,\nwhich will probably last four months. But\nonce they've got the basic structure up it will\nactually be much quieter, because the work\nwill mostly be internal. The library will be\ngoing on in parallel, but mostly out of term: a lot of it will be done this summer.\nCampus renaissance?\nThe overall building program that is underway\npreparing Imperial for its medical school and\ntaking the College into the twenty first cent u ry, has been dubbed 'the campus renaissance.'\nSo what's that then?\nLooking at the college as a whole, this\nsurge of building offers the opportunity to\ngive the whole campus a face lift in a way it\nhas not had for twenty years. Frankly quite a lot of the campus is getting pretty run down\n- if you come here every day, you tend to\naccept it. But on a worrying number of occasions people have come and looked round,\nand they've also been to some of the newer\nuniversities, with their very attractive accommodation and settings, and they've said\n\"Well, I'd rather go there.\" We can't afford\nthat. We are unlikely ever to compete with\nthe best for accommodation, but we've got to\na maintain a particular decent standard, and I think we're getting perilously close to falling\nbelow that at the moment. Some of our halls\nof residence frankly I'm ashamed of, and we\nreally have to do something about that.\nThe union move\nIt was the way my year started: fear and\nloathing from my new employers, concerned\nthat they were to be moved to the concrete\nmonstrosity that is the Sherfield building so\nthat Beit Quad could be turned into a conference centre. Or something like that. What was\nit all about, and where are we now?\nFundamentally the union was opposed, I think probably for the wrong reasons, to m ov ing. We looked at the cost of moving them\nover here, and it was going to very substantial.\nIf the Union had said \"yes, this is a great\nopportunity,\" (and I think it was, I think\nthey've blown it, to be quite honest) saying\n\"we want to do it, we want to make this\nwork,\" we would have said \"okay, we'll try to\nfind the money.\" But it was not worth pushing it. It was a jolly expensive idea.\nBut there are many different ways of\ndoing it. We can expand the Union facilities\nover there: it's pretty clear that we're going to\nhave to find more meeting rooms and things\nof that kind, and we're going to have to give\nquite a lot of thought to that. It may be that\nwe can provide some Union society rooms\nover here in Sherfield.\nHigher education funding\nWe are in the privileged position of having a Rector who also happens to sit on the Dearing\nCommittee, which has just met for the first\ntime to consider the whole area of higher education funding. Will Sir Ronald be trumpeting\nthe cause of the elite science and technology\nestablishment, I wonder, or representing the\ncommon or garden undergraduate-in -penury\nin a an expensive part of London?\nI don't consider myself as representing\n\n"

FELIX WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH1996 CREDITS\nThere really isn't enough room to thank all those who have contributed this year, even less so those who have supported, counselled\nand advised. The people who have been involved in Felix 95 - 96 have encouraged and inspired me, and a great many have become\nsuperb friends. What follows is 1 600 words of in-jokes to thank just a few of them: it will probably not mean a great deal to anyone\nbut those concerned, for which I make no apology. Allow me one last page of self-in du gence... Miles Ambler encouraged me to stand for the job in the first place and I still feel guilty that he didn't get his, but hey, he got the last laugh! \u2022 Is\nthere anything that mar hB a hEr can't do? The ultimate in technical assistants, he was the one who actually got things done, and really is the person\nwithout whom it would never have been possible. What a starr r... \u2022 So damning had Simon Baker been on my predecessors I was terrified to actually ask him to step over to the other side. I am still overwhelmed at his in statia ble enthusiasm and perseverance long after I could be bothered to\nkeep pushing the points. \u2022 VIK b fl ll Sfl L: The most laid back man I 've ever met, dedicated to the end, despite it being two days before his wedding! This\nman has more moral fibre than the rest of them put together, and I respect him immensely. \u2022 Nat Barb : Infectious enthusiasm, and a female to boot!\nNat had an amazing knack of appearing just when there was no one else around. Thanks! \u2022 OW A IN BENN AL LACK: What can I say? Hero, in spira tion, mentor, person to take the piss out of... In retrospect I'm beginning to realise that I probably was quite useful to you, which might go in some\nsmall way towards returning the favour of giving me everything I have had. \u2022 The world is a better place for the idealism of MARK BRIDGE. I'm sorry I was\ntoo cynical for him. \u2022 It is a very great shame that Felix hacks of the future will never have known Terry Briley: our man on the inside; endlessly enter-tai ning, but far more importantly someone who never hid the fact that he actually had rather a soft spot for students. \u2022 Ian Caldwell : Scapegoat '95\n- '96. Single handedly helped achieve the one goal I really felt I made: to actually begin to tell the students what was going on. \u2022 I need say nothing\nother than that Ivan Chan is a truly lovely guy, who probably never realised how much 'Mom!' appreciated his straightforward dedication and enthusiasm. \u2022 The fact that the one major argument al upset I 've had all year was with Matt il \u00ab flint! II is a very great shame, because I have much fonder\nmemories of that day when we had our photographs taken on the roof of the chemistry building. I think he has done a great job, though I continue\nto be intimidated by the tidiness of his desk. \u2022 Juliet* &)ee a e&v j as the great unsung behind-the-chaos heroine of the early days, and the person who\nI really deserved nothing from at all. Thank you. \u2022 The presence of PAUL MAS has a lot to do with me being here in the first place. That he has hardly\nspoken to me since is, quite frankly, crap. \u2022 MUM UW DORMAM-VMIIH never let me get away with anything without an argument, which was pretty cool:\nI'd trust this man with my life. The cr a ic's been good, and I 'll miss you. \u2022 I honestly don't know what to make of fcW lW WP WMJWlWW: normally people I like aren't quite so infuriating! Thank you: for putting up with being patronised, for wanting to be here next year, and for Robert Fisk on the sofa.\n\u2022 Dipak Ghosh was superb (until he disappeared!), happily gifted with the unusual combination of being really keen and a good writer to boot! \u2022 I wish I'd had the courage to ask Hikf fl nfl SET for help earlier; not many in Sherfield are so honest, even if it's not what you want to hear. \u2022 [l00IH an Ha(|ll B: the most prolific writer I have ever met, and, in the end, not like all the other kids... \u2022 As Tories go, Stephen Hamilton isn't all that bad! Besides, anyone who turns up just when the interest is beginning to thoroughly flag and quite happily takes on the most tedious job of the lot gets my vote! \u2022\nSarah HickingbOttOm is one of very few of my old friends that actually weighed in, which meant a great deal. \u2022 .Katie Hopkins, Jenny Ho and Adrian\nBerry were the great cogs on the frighteningly reliable cinematic team. They were so remarkably efficient I never got to know them, which is a bit of a shame. Thanks for all the effort! \u2022 What's great, what's exciting, what's fabulous? MB*)* HOM IS is definitely one of the good guys from upstairs, and\none who seemed to appreciate how it was. \"Whatcha, sex-god?\" \u2022 Somehow Jane Hoylehas managed to come to terms with the great fiscal mess that\nis the Felix/Print Unit finances. Tirelessly helpful: it was great to have her around. \u2022 I have enormous admiration for Mandy Hurford and appreciate the fact that she listened to what I had to say. Thank you for making me feel worthwhile! \u2022 The only problem I have with Jon Jordan is that\nhe makes me feel thoroughly inept: this man seems to produce brilliancy in everything he touches. But I like to think a little of it rubs off, and besides,\nhe made exceptionally good company last summer. \u2022 Wei Lee has been the most reliable of the lot (by a long chalk) this year. He could never really appreciate how high an accolade that is. \u2022 If only William tor cur's talent was matched with the willingness to sacrifice his degree in the way this\nplace demands! He's taken some superb pictures this year. \u2022 Not every Felix editor gets their own personal management consultant: I got Da,r% Look,\nan endless provider of 'meaningful management information'. Suffice to say that I couldn't have done it without him. \u2022 Michael LudlaiTI is the only\nperson who has really driven me to despair this year, so I thank him for heightening the experience. There's no point in working your third consecutive 100 hour week if can't have someone utterly unreasonable giving you abuse at the end of it. \u2022 Joe M cPa J Jen is just about the only person who\ndidn't patron is e me as if Thursday evening stress was a great sign of weakness. Thank you for your support \u2022 I find GIDON MOON T fascinating because\nhe's interested in all sorts of things I'm not! Thanks for all you've done. \u2022 Steve Newhouse is the only member of the old school that made me really\nfeel proud to be part of some sort of a heritage. Also an exceptionally useful information service! \u2022 Ah, the life of Ro6in Rifey, late-comer on the news\nteam and all round good blok e \u2022 Gfaire SamueJ pottered in and out during second term with an enormously uplifting cheery smile and some rather\ngood theatre reviews. \u2022 If only it didn't sound like such faint praise to thank Tim Si.O air heartily for being so thoroughly useful all year. Good luck\nin whatever you end up doing. \u2022 j\\n dy SinWaray's idealism and continual enthusiasm provided a motivating force at many of those times when I really couldn't be arse d any more. I'm really sorry he couldn't make it back in the end, but am touched that he cared so much, -Erie Stables will probably not remember the November morning he stopped me on the walkway at 8am on a Friday morning to tell me how much he enjoyed Felix. It helped\nim measure ably. \u2022 Pt T)(i|) TFforripsoi): If not quite God, than certainly a god of some sort. \u2022 Things have changed since this time last year when I told Jeremy\nThomson that he terrified me: If only he wasn't so damn unreliable! His enthusiasm has made it all worthwhile. \u2022 ^^ed&^Affi&a^ has been saying\nsupportive things at sporadic intervals all year, generally making me feel big and important. People like that help a lot! \u2022 Most misunderstood '95 -'96: HiM ill] has really pissed me off a couple of times this year, but underneath that bulldozing exterior there is a highly motivated, enthusiastic, innovative and hugely intelligent man. If only he could learn the meaning of tact and diplomacy more might have realised what an exceptional job he's done this year \u2022 (Bral)ain t Crest tt made me a lovely pizza once, and he has been a great escape. \u2022 There have been a couple of occasions when I have\nreally wanted to thump JfeufflMWM\u00a3bM WMmWIP But when he was sober he showed a great knack for writing and at least he was funny when he\nwas pissed. \u2022 Andrew Tseng told me smug gly I was bound to end up as editor about a fortnight after I first walked into the Felix office. Thank you\nfor your confidence in me! \u2022 I am forever grateful that t>*n J*r Slr\u00bb\u00abl \u00ab^ indulged my game of playing shops whilst explaining VAT to me for the\n17th time. Thank you for your patience. \u2022 Sarah \"White put up with me patronising here all year. This woman has remarkable patience and has\nbeen a superb ambassador \u2022 Ben Wilkini has provided the only part of Felix that I could say has been consistently excellent. He also has an in exp li c able, but damn handy enjoyment of collating. And if that wasn't enough, he's a lovely, caring and hilarious blok e. \u2022 The first time I met Piers Williams\nI thought he was utterly horrendous: my first impressions have always been useless. Thanks for explaining all that Pub board stuff I knew nothing about,\nand good luck next year! \u2022 Yvonne Woods and lan Richardson: thank you for feeding me. Emotional sustenance only goes so far!\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS REVIEW FELIX WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH1996. SEVEN\n3. Ghassan\nKarrian\nThe Rag politic king was nothing\nwhen compared to the machinations at the University of London\nUnion. Following close behind in\nthe 'most mentions' category was\nthat long-serving friend of ICU,\nthat unavoidable Ghassan Karian\n(formerly called the ULU\nPresident). You could hardly\nhave missed his transformation\nfrom 'friend of IC to 'villain of\nthe year.'\nIt all started with a soft\nfocus study of a rather drunken\nMr Karian and even more inebriated Sarah White - ULU/IC\nrelations seemed to have a bright\nfuture. The Labour Councillor\nwas pushing his initiative to overturn the NUS policy of fighting\nfor a return to 1979 grant levels.\nHe was not alone, with ICU's President attending his 'New\nSolutions' group in an unofficial\ncapacity. What could possibly\nstop this budding relationship\nbearing fruit for both parties?\nThe cooling-off started in\nFebruary, when Mr Karian\nattended a ICU Council meeting\nwhich was debating his proposal\nfor a new ULU constitution.\nWith accusations of \"half-cocked\nappeasement,\" but still with the\nsupport of other ULU sabbaticals, his proposal was eventually\naccepted.\nNext in the ULU/Karian\nsaga came the revelation that\nICU's own Sarah White was bidding to become Karian's succes-sor. A result of 35-23 in Ms\nWhite's favour, even if she did\nthink that it was \"A bit closer'\nseemed a good omen for an ever\ncloser relationship between the\ntwo Unions. But nobody was\nready for the final slide into the\nmire through which student pol-ln: all alone\nOut: friends together\nit ics seems only too happy to\ntravel.\n'New Labour' connections\nhad been well-documented in\nprevious issues, but Mr Karian's employment by Tony Blair's party came as a shock, especially\nas he still had two months of his\ncontract to finish. Breaking\nagreements clearly did not pose a problem for the soon-to-be\nLabour spin doctor.\" I just don't understand\nhim,\" Sarah was quoted as saying\nin one of her analyses of events\nsurrounding the debacle. The\nproblem was that the ICU\nPresident would have limited\ntraining for her new role which\nthe July handover period was\nsupposed to provide. So far had\nthey travelled from their drunken intimacies at the beginning of\nthe year.\nWorse was to come as Ms\nWhite was hard-pressed to stop\nICU Council from forcing her to\npropose a motion of no confidence in her former friend. A compromise whereby she would\nsupport a motion only if it was\nproposed by others seemed to\nhave got Sarah off the hook.\nWith friends rapidly falling\naway from the previously-pop u lar Karian, the ICU compromise\nlooked increasingly meaningless\nas a motion of no confidence\nbecame inevitable. The ULU\nPresident was now on the attack\ncalling his opponents \"petty\npoliticians who have nothing better to do,\" insisting that he\n\"would prefer not to have to do\ntwo jobs anyway.\"\nThe year of friction drew to\na close with Ghassan Karrian\nresigning his position before the\nvote of no confidence went\nahead.\n4. Higher Education Funding\nBeyond Imperial, the national\ndebate on the future funding of\nhigher education came to the\nfore this year. We learnt in\nDecember that Imperial was to\nlose \u00a32million through the gov-ern ment' s decision to transfer\nmoney from higher education to\nthe primary and secondary sec-tors.\nWhile Gillian Shephard was\n'trumpeting' the action, those\nwho had lost out were understandably feeling somewhat in se cure. The Rector of Imperial\nCollege described the cuts as\n\"derisory,\" and one vice-chancel-lor went as far as describing them\nas \"an act of vandalism bereft of\nany strategic direction.\"\nAs some of the hardest hit\nuniversities were openly debating\ntop-up fees as an alternative\nsource of funding, opposition was\nmounting. The rather uncoordinated spectacle of the Durham's SU President suggesting one\nmove, while Manchester's Student Union leader suggested\nanother, may not have evoked\noptimism, but help was at hand\nfrom a rather unexpected party.\nThat well known opponent\nof student poverty, Her\nMajesty's Tory Government,\nscared of losing even more of its\nfalling middle class vote, moved\nin behind the students against\nthe universities. They insisted\nthat there was \"no need for top-up fees,\" and expressed concern\nover the suffering that tolls\nwould cause those students from\n\"less well off families.\" The Pro\nRector suggested that the\nGovernment was \"getting other\npeople to do their dirty work,\"\nbut College authorities admitted\nthat they were seriously considering how top-up fees could be\nimposed.\nThe political\nposturing increased\nas a divided\nCommittee of Vice\nChancellors and\nPrincipals decided\nto impose top-up\nfees in the run up to\nthe next Genera\nElection. Imperia\nCollege's Rector did\nOut: fat of the land\nnot support this move, insisting\nthat \"IC has no intention of\ncharging a \u00a3300 fee.\"\nWhatever the real feelings of\nthis disparate group of University\nand College heads, the desired\neffect was achieved with the\nSecretary of State for Education\nbeing manoeuvre d into an\nembarrassing 'backtrack' by the\nhigh profile campaign. With disagreements between Government Ministers themselves, the\nTory's education 'policy' looked\nin increasing disarray.\nBut while Richard Wilson, of\n'One Foot in the Grave' fame,\nwas getting elected as Rector of\nGlasgow, the National Union of\nStudents had greater issues to\nconsider. The great funding\ndebate - whether the NUS\nshould still demand a return to\n1979 grant levels - continued to\ndominate proceedings at student\ngatherings.\nWhen Douglas Trainer, the\nmoderate Scotsman, was elected\nto be next year's President, it\nlooked as if last year's decision\nwould be overturned. With the\nubiquitous Mr Karian insisting\nthat, \"The [present] policy is\nun achievable and will not address\nthe problems we face,\" the long-standing, and much-criticised,\npolicy was summarily abandoned. In: let them eat cake\n\n"
