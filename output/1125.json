    "content": "9 November 1998 Music 23\ndim\nThe Narrow Mindedness of Today's Dance Scene by Tony Thorpe (Language Records)\nWho is Tony Thorpe? He DJs in public very rarely, and\nas far as I know he hasn't made much music recently.\nSo why are we devoting this column to him?\nNowadays Tony is the boss of Language Records,\nresponsible for bringing to us, amongst others, the\nexcellent Buckfunk 3000 (aka Si Begg). Don't expect me\nto tell you what musical cat ago ries you'll find on this\nlabel as it crosses many boundaries, fang u age has\nbeen described as three-and-a half years of adventures, passion, discoveries, danger, madness, courage,\nfaith, audacity, political-in core ct ness...\nTony has been in the music scene since 1984\nwhen he started making music as part of the 400 Blows\n(Illuminated Records). You might know him as one of\nthe Moody Boyz (XL Records) from the late 1980s. As\nfor his DJing abilities? Well all I can say is that it's a real\nshame he doesn't play out more. During our meeting\nhe recorded an hour mix for the radio show that covered a range of music from hip-hop to electro to jazz\nand breakbeat s. It wasn'ta matter of seamless mixing\nin one sub-genre. This is a man who simply loves the\npower of music (if I may coin such ac liche) and is totally\nin love with what he is doing. Is that enough of an Introduction?\nTony talked to us about the days when he started\noff in 400 Blows. 'We were doing underground, weirdo\nmusic really. After the sort of punk thing it all sort of\n'weird ed out' and everything became funky and people were mixing all different influences. People like The\nCabs and 23 Skidoos were mixing funk with avant\ngarde music and so were we really.\n'In the early 80'sI was into listening to a lot of funky\nsoul and funk stuff. I heard a band called A Certain Ratio\nand they totally blew me away really because It wasn't typical black American funk. It was totally different.\nThat kind of stuff really inspired me to make music. At\nthe time I met up with a guy called Andrew Beer who\nhad a deal with Illuminated Records. It was really my\nmusical background that made me a part of the band.\nI came from black roots whereas Andrew had more of\na punk, gothic background, so together the two influences just came up with weird stuff.\n'When I first started making music I had no idea\nwhat I was doing. I didn't play any instruments. There\nweren't computers around. I remember making records\nby taking a massive tape loop, putting it on a broomstick and trying to get a breakbeat out of it! I was doing\nstuff pre-samplers and making music any way necessary.\n'On the first album we had country and western,\nelectro, funk ambient. Everything was on it! We really\ndidn't care what wc were doing. We just did what we\nwanted to. People used to think we were mad. Just\nthese couple of odd-bod s really! Whereas now I listen\nto what we were doing ten or twelve years ago and it's almost like things have caught up with it.'\nAt the moment Tony is making an album of new\nmaterial for a company called III Recordings. 'When I do\none thing I then want to move on to something else.\nI 've never been stuck in a rut. With my stuff, it's just\nwhatever I wanna do when I wanna do it. If I had just\nmade one style then I probably would have burnt out\nlong ago, but people have never been able to pin me\ndown so it gives me the room to continue. That's why\nI'm still here. My music is concepts, it's feeling, it's s pont an a it y, it's everything. Half the time I never know what\nI'm going to end up with when I start.'\nI asked Tony if his mix was a typical set that he\nwould play out. T didn't get all my influences in there.\nObviously there wasn't enough time for that. I'd probably need about 5 hours for that. Whenever I play out\nit's always that kind of stuff. I'm not into lh at 'It's got\nto be 180 BPM to make it work!' I like people to listen\nto music. You never know, there might be something\nthey like there and they might want to go out and buy\nit, so I'm not into that kind of formula DJing really. I'm into playing whatever I want to play and that's the way\nI am. I 've always been that way really.'\nTony doesn't see himself as a regular DJ. 'It's just\na hobby. It's something I do for a laugh and it's not seri-o us. No way! It's too much pressure I think. At the end\nof the day I actually think that records are more important than DJs. I think the people who make the records\nare more important than the people who play them. I wish things would go back that way because right now\nI think that DJs are just too powerful.\n'Also if you're a DJ and you're in that position of\npower you should give the audience the opportunity\nto hear all types of music and no l just the one genre.\nBut the problem is that because things have just broken up into many different genres it's difficult for people to concentrate on one thing. It's become either one\nthing or nothing. It's either drum'n 'bass or nothing,\ntechno or nothing etc. It's a bit sad with the mill c niu m that people are still very narrow-minded with music. It's actually gone backwards in that respect. Everything's being recycled right now. Sixteen year old kids are sampling an old Parliament Eunkadelic record and they\nhaven't got a clue what the original is. People arc just\ngoing into the past, digging up as much as possible,\nsampling it up and putting it out. It's weird because my\nrecord collection is being sampled when people should\nbe having their own ideas. But they're playing it safe\nand that's the easiest thing to do.'\nDespite being central in the avant garde electronic\nmusic scene with his Language project, Tony prefers not\nto go clubbing. 'DJs I like arc Darren freak Nasty,\nAndrew Weatherall and Alex Patterson (The Orb). I 've\noften seen them play and they play a mixed set, but at\nthe same time they'll do a club and it's one type of\nmusic so DJs can be very frustrated people because they\ncan't play what they want to play. They have to play what\nthe crowd wants and keep the floor going. You can drop\nsomething and the floor clears and people aren't willing to take that chance. I don't think anybody is really.\nSo I don't really go to clubs because there's nothing I want to hear. I here are no clubs playing the sort of\nmusic l hatI want to hear so really I just don't!' Tony desc t ibes fang u age as The mos l eclectic\nlabel there is. It reflects my tastes. I'd be so frustrated\nand bored if I was doing just a techno label, or just a drum'n 'bass label. I'd go mad. If you look in my collection there's classical, there's rock, there's funk,\nthere's soul, there's jazz. I listen to everything. So that's why my label reflects what I'm into. I know people have\na problem with that but I'm never going to change. The\nlabel's like a dev elopement label. People come to me\nwith ideas and with my experience I help people. I try\nto develop and put them in the right direction with what\nthey're doing. I will never release on Language. The\nemphasis is not on me. It's on giving other people the\nopportunity to put things out.'\ntony has put out a compilation of new and released\ntracks called the Family Album. It brings together the\nlast four years of the label and is a stunning collection\nof tracks that mark the philosophy and ideals of this very\nunique label. It is an excellent starting point for those\ninterested in Language. a lick i.Ji iii iii a i "

    "content": "10 9 November 1998\nRight Angles To Reality\nMind the Gap\nG ap Kids is opening a new store\nin fall '98. For those of you for\nwhom English is your first lan-gua ge,I 'll translate: American clothing manufacturer Gap will be opening\na new children's shop in autumn of\nthis year. Were this major fashion\nevent occurring in the United States of\ncourse, no further explanation would\nbe necessary, however the projected\noutlet in question is to be sited in\nWhitley's of Bayswater hence the need\nfor clarification. Whilst it is not the job\nof this columnist to encourage or dissuade you from purchasing any of the\nmerchandise available from the aforementioned retailer (although I would\nadvise that the lime green polyester\nsweaters with the bold orange and\nheliotrope floral design be given a wide berth), or to comment on the\nshameless use of the inimitable slogan\n\"Khakis Rock\" to persuade the 18-25\nage group to buy trousers that are\nquite obviously nothing more than ex-Army surplus left over from the Battle\nof El-Alamein, I felt that the wording of\nthe announcement that heralded the\nimminent arrival of this, their newest\nbranch in central London could not\ngo un remarked upon.\nThose of you not possessed of a wanderlust and who thus seldom venture forth into the\nwilds of darkest W2\nmay not have heard\nof the emporium\nwithin whose good\nportals The Gap\nhave chosen to\nlocate the base\nfrom which to\nlaunch their\nimpending foray\ninto the juvenile\nclothing market\nwest of Hyde Park.\nIn the words of that\nmost superlative of sleuths, Hercule\nPoirot, lees ten to me ahn d you shell\nle urn every sing. Situated on the\nQueensway with its gleaming facade\ntowering majestically over the otherwise nondescript roofs of the locale;\nboasting shops, restaurants, cafes, and\na multi screen cinema to boot, Whiteley's is an alabaster temple to the god\nof consumerism; a shrine to what has\nbecome the central motivating force of\nWestern civilisation as we limp bloodied and bruised to the end of the twentieth century and peer sweaty-palmed\nin anticipation over the precipice of the\n'...Naf-Naf... an\nappellation so\npointlessly self-referential, it\nneeds no\nexplanation)...'\nit actually\nMy point\n...I would advise that\nthe lime green polyester sweaters with\nthe bold orange and\nheliotrope floral\ndesign be given a wide berth...'\ntwenty-first.\nYou get the picture\nWhiteley's is a shopping\ncentre, although if the announcement\nfrom The Gap is anything to go by, it\nwon't be long before it is a mall. More\nworrying ly, according to a close friend\nof mine who, being French is naturally\nmuch better informed than I on the\nmatter of haute couture (you might\nnot believe it, but this columnist actually passed French at 'O' level, albeit\nonly just - I almost failed due to my\nmis translating fin de siecle and coup\nde grace as \"cycling\nenthusiast\" and \"to\nmow the lawn\" respectively), \"Gap\" actually\nstands for \"Great American People\". Of course\na business can call itself\nanything it pleases, and\nset alongside companies with names like\nTandy, Muji and Naf-Naf\n(an appellation so pointlessly self-referential, it\nneeds no explanation)\nseems pretty reasonable\n(and you'll be relieved to learn that\nthere is one) is that with that kind of\nin-your-face moniker, Gap's marketing\nstrategy for Bayswater is clearly not\ngoing to stop at one\nor two boutiques in\nWhiteley's. There\ngoes the neigh-b our hood. How\nlong, I wonder\nbefore all the shops\non the Queensway\ncease to trade six\ndays a week and\nbegin to open\n\"Monday thru Saturday\" or Boot's the\nChemist is sucked\ninto the Uncle Sam\nLinguistic Re-orientation Program to\nemerge as Col. Jesse's Drugstore.\nBefore you know it, the many independant grocers that line both sides of\nthat thoroughfare will be selling soda\npop, candy bars and \"sem-eye\"-skim mcd milk - although sales of fags\nwill no doubt plummet.\nIt may have already started. Shortly\nafter leaving Whiteley'sI was offered\nthe option of having my hamburger \"to\ngo\" (although where was not specified) at a well-known fast food restaurant that maintains a franchise in the\nBayswatcr area. As it is not within my\nMatt Salter\nremit to offer free advertising to multi-national\ncorporations, I will forbear to mention the name of said\nestablishment, save to note that in my\ncase, they utterly failed to live up to\ntheir principal advertising slogan (\"You\nwant it your way at (name of internationally re known ed hamburger rest au rant). You got it\"). The way I wanted it\nwas \"free\" - an option apparently not\ncatered for in their marketing strat-e gy. The manager of the branch in\nquestion seemed to be completely\nunconcerned about this\nblatant breach of the\nTrades Description Act\nand was most unsympathetic to my requests,\nas were Carl and Winston who kindly agreed\nto act as my escorts out\nof the shop and into\nthe gutter.\nPlease don't misunderstand me - I don't dislike Americans.\nMany of the people I count amongst\nmy closest friends are citizens of the\nUSA, and some of them can speak\nEnglish quite well. It's also untrue to\nsay that I am unreasonably chau-venis tic about my mother tongue - I love languages, I'm fascinated by\nthem, and let's face it, if ever there is\na language that has\nbeen shaped by outside forces, it is English. Apropos of\nwhich, loan words (vi de supra) are fast becoming a sine qua non of\neducated conversation,\nand their bone fide\nusage in describing the\ncultural Zeitgeist has\nbecome de rig u er amongst the in tell i gen sia, making them the be te noire of\nstudents of the English lang u ge. The\nmany bon mot s which originated\nbeyond these shores but which are\nnow permanent fixtures of English are\nto be welcomed with open arms, lovingly caressed, rolled around the\nmouth, sav our ed for their exotic nature\nand the richness and depth that they\nbring to the language. By and large,\nthey have been given British citizenship precisely because they concisely\nand stylishly fill a void of expression left\nby etymological shortcomings of native\nwords. Try finding suitable home-Try finding suitable home-grown\nsubstitutes for fait\nac comp li or\npap para zi and see\nhow far you get.'\ngrown substitutes for fait ac comp li or\npap para zi and see how far you get.\nBut the thing that is guaranteed to\ncause me to breathe heavily and activate the nervous tick that first developed when I lost \u00a33.72 in a single\nsession on the penny slot machines at\nthe pleasure beach at Hunstanton in\n1 977, is the gratuitous use of words\nlike \"fall\", \"trash can\" and \"restroom\" in\na woefully misguided attempt to\nappear cool and \"Generation X\"( what-ever that is: answers on a postcard). In\nmy book, these words are fine if you're\nAmerican, not fine if you're not but just\nwannabe. I 've been to the US and it\nis as fine a place as you could want to\nvisit. Whilst there I took great delight\nin having my eggs \"easy over\", drinking a \"regular\" coffee (or should I say\n\"caw fee\") in Starbucks and checking\nhouse prices in the Princeton area in\na \"real estate\" agent's shop window. 1\neven purchased a couple of pairs of\nvery reasonably priced \"pants\"\n(although I drew the line at buying\n\"suspenders\"). And do you know\nwhat? I did not feel linguistically compromised once, because seen in their\nnative habitat, these words look happy,\nwell-fed and comfortable. Transplanting them to London W2 makes them\nlooks as embarrassed, uneasy and\nincongruous as Barbara Cartland in\njeans and aT shirt.\nAs I got up out of\nthe sea of empty\nburger boxes, soft\ndrink cups and half\neaten, but still red-hot\napple pies that had\nbeen left in the roadside where Carl and\nWinston had unceremoniously dumped\nme, I resolved to continue posting letters\ninstead of \"mailing\"\nthem, to dispose of my household\nrefuse in dustbins in preference to\nthrowing \"garbage\" in \"trash cans\", and\nto empty my bladder in toilets rather\nthan in \"bathrooms\". Have I made Ihe\nright choice? You bet your sweet ass\nbubba. Maybe it was my imagination\nbut even my old nemesis London\nUnderground appears to agree,\nbecause as I boarded the tube home\nI could swear that I heard a voice\ntelling me to \"Mind the Gap\".\n\n"

    "content": "2 News 9 November 1998\nTheft at Wilson House\nOn Thursday 22 October a student living\nin an IC hall of residence was the victim\nof a burglary. The incident happened\nbetween 8:30pm and 11:30pm and left\nthe third year student without his stereo\nand missing some clothes.\nHe usually kept his \u00a31,500 laptop\nlying on his desk but luckily he had lent\nit to a friend that week. Also the mini-disk\nhe had purchased the day before was\nleft untouched in his draw. Unfortunately\nthat was where his luck ran out. the incident occurred only four days after the\nstudent had moved into halls. He had\nbeen looking for accommodation since\nthe beginning of term and was supposed to be temporarily housed in Wilson Hall for two weeks.\nThe thieves made off with a stereo-system, CDs, clothes and a bag: property\nwith a total value of about \u00a3600.\nThe student, who wishes to remain\nanonymous, telephoned the police, and\nnotified the sub-warden, who called Sherfield security Immediately. By the next\nday signs were put up in the hall of residence and the police sent around someone to take fingerprints, but they did\nnot find anything unusual.\nThe individual still feels slightly Insecure at times but his transfer to a different room has helped him to overcome\nthe trauma. He commented \"I thought\nthis might happen to me in a flat but not\nin halls\". He is frustrated at the situation\nand feels \"it could have been avoided\".\nThe student insists that a security camera\ninstalled to monitor the first floor windows would act as suitable deterrent for\nBy Tony Ofori\nburglars.\nThe person admits that he was partially to blame because he left his window open. This along with the fact that\nthe flat roofed houses that back on to\nWilson Hall provide someone with easy\naccess is a welcoming situation for\nopportunist burglary.\nAt the moment the student is going\nthrough the time-consuming task of making claims to the insurance company. I lis\nadvice to any student in hall of residence\nis that they should take out additional\ninsurance if they have very expensive\npossessions in their room as basic insurance only covers items up to a total\nvalue of approximately \u00a3600.\nKen Weir, chief security officer, said\nthat to avoid such incidents students in\nhalls of residence should lock all windows and doors since they do have locks\nfitted to them. He added that as of late\nsuch burglaries have been very rare. Students should be aware that the problem\ndoes exist, but should not become paranoid about it.\nIn response to the issue about security cameras Mr Weir pointed out that\nCCTV is effective but they are limited in\nthe area that they can cover by cost and\nprivacy. If installing a camera means that\nresidences from the surrounding area\nfeel a violation of their privacy has\noccured, then the camera has to be\nremoved or re-sited. Referring to Wilson\nHall, the chief security officer also stated,\n\"security has increased by a considerable amount over the past two years\" and\ncollege are always \"looking to reduce the\nrisk of crime\". He, in conjunction with\nsomeone from the police's crime prevention unit, are currently reviewing the\nsituation around Wilson House.\nJust before the beginning of term\nanother similar burglary was reported at\nthe same Hall. The items that were\nallegedly taken were not as expensive as\nthis occasion but nevertheless the two\nincidents do share some similarities. As\nyet no connections have been made\nbetween the incidences, and the matter\nis the subject of an ongoing invest iga tion.\nissue 1125\n9 November 1998\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nNews Lditor.

It is hoped there will be some joint\nactivities, as well as separate ones. The\nbeer festival is currently searching for a suitable venue, although Dave Hellard is\nattempting to rectify the situation.

Bacterial meningitis is quite rare but may be\nvery serious, there are two types of bacterial meningitis: men in go co c cal and\np neum oc occ al. In addition the bacteria\ncan result in septic a emi a. How is bacterial meningitis spread?\nMany people carry the bacteria in the\nback of the throat. Whilst the bacteria can\nbe spread by kissing,\nsneezing and coughing it is weak outside\nthe body. After exposure\nsymptoms usually\nappear after 2-10 days.\nWhat is the prognosis?\nIf diagnosed early\nand treated rapidly then\na full recovery is likely.\nWhat does meningitis\ndo?\nIt inflames the tissues that cover the brain\n(meninges) and spinal\ncord. The same bacteria\nresponsible for inflammation of the meninges\nBy Brett Donovan\n& Andy Ofori\nIf a rash appears under the skin\nwhich doesn't fade when\npressed (most easily tested\nusing a glass), call a doctor\nImmediately, as this is a symptom of septic a emi a. are also responsible\nfor the variant\nmen in go co c cal septic a emi a, which causes\nbleeding under the skin.\nCan I develop men in gi tis?\nThe risk of developing meningitis is very\nsmall, even if you have\nbeen in direct contact\nwith a diagnosed case.\nThe causal bacteria is car-ried, in fact, by approximately 10 percent of\npeople. There is still a risk, however, and it\nsaves lives if you are\naware of the symptoms.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe symptoms are similar to flu in\nmany respects, but symptoms get progressively worse very rapidly. Symptoms\ninclude; vomiting, fever, severe\nheadache, joint pains, aversion to bright\nlights, lethargy, confusion and fits. In\naddition to this rashes appear during\nseptic a emi a. It is important to note lh at not all the symptoms may be present.\nWhat do I do if I think I have it?\nDon't panic, check the symptoms,\nand get medical help as soon as p ossi ble.

    "content": "9 November 1998 Music 21\nTALVIN SINGH\nTalvin Singh. He'll bend over\nbackwards to please you.\nF or the past five years the Asian\nmusic scene has been creeping\nits way into the consciousness of\nthe music buying public. Bands like\nCornershop, who have been around for\nat least the past seven years and Asian\nDub Foundation are only now receiving\nthe sort of critical acclaim they deserve.\nEqually Talvin Singh has pioneered a much more roots oriented musical\nsound. First acclaimed for his amazing\nmastery of the tabla s, a kind of drum,\nwhich he began to learn to play when\nhe was seven years old, Talvin then progressed to start his own club night\nAnokha, at the Blue Note. It was and\nstill is, a great success.\nTalvin found he had some ra the t unusually famous groupies. Amongst\nthese we te the diminutive Icelandic pixie\nBjork and the flaxen ed haired image\nmonger Madonna. I le played an influential part in various tunes on both of\ntheir last albums. I le's also supported\nDavid Bowie on tour and has remixed\none of his tracks.\nSo what of this Asian music pio-ne er's new album OKI The feel is definitely an ethnic one with Instruments like\nthe she nai, the veen a and the ra bab. The\nbass lines are not only the pure Indian\ntabla sounds, though. There are also the\nsort of drum breaks normally associated\nwith hip-hop or drum 'n' bass driving a great number of the tracks. This fusion\ngives a kind of other worldly feel, sometimes like a chaotic techno-Delhi in the\nyear 2100. Other tracks are more serene\nand float y. Those with vocals are the\nstrongest especially the excellent Sutrix\nwith its hypnotic I lindi chant. I he album\nhangs together very well but some of the\ntracks are difficult whilst only a few are\nexceptional. Very good for a chill out\nroom. El\nRamzi\nFAT HARRY WHITE\nFat Harry White\nL ast summer, I was working at a car factory. Every day, at 3 pm we\nwould have a tea break. We\nwould always look forward to this\nbreak. After lunch, rather than grudgingly returning to the lathes for a soul-destroying slog of filing and welding,\nthe break gave us a sense of optimism.\nWhat made these moments of hope\nprecious was a radio show with Mark n' Lard. We'd eagerly huddle around that\ncollection of wires and transistors and\nchortle our socks off to I larry's puerile\ninnuendoes. Titles include Fingering\nthe Keyboard of Love. Looking Deep\nInside for Love and the classic My Baby\nStroked My Bread. It's not cutting edge\nhumour, but I larry does those smutty\ndouble entendres better than anyone.\nSo if you want to hear about I larry's exploits with his 'very sexy lady friends'\nget hold of a copy now. After a short\nsession with Fat I larry, I guarantee\nyou'll be satisfied. H lorn\nSingles\nARCO - Longsighted\nThe A side to this delightful record is Distant Lies - a strangely mystical tune that leaves you feeling warm\ninside. As the record label suggests, it has a dreamy,\nmellow, chilled-out feel - reminiscent of those Welsh\nwizards, Gorkys Zygotic Mynci. All in all, it is not a record to rock to and it won't make the charts, but it is\ndefinitely worth a listen.\nEve 6 - Superhero Girl\nThere's nothing actually wrong with this song, but\nthere is something I can't put my finger on. It must be\nthat I 've heard it millions of times before under many\ndifferent guises. It rocks, but it's nothing new.\nGroop Dogdrlll - Personal/Hedly had ly This tension filled mass of musical frenzy comes on bottle green vinyl - what more need I say! Only that Personal begins with a whiplash of drumming that\ncontinues at breakneck pace throughout the entire\nsong. Ilea vy yet listenable. Unfortunately l led ly had ly is a disappointment compared to the A side as it is just\na mess of disorganised noise. It does not do the\nrecord justice.\nNeutral Milk Hotel - Holland\nA suspicious mind would be saying to itself, 'They must\nhave something to hide by creating this fancy 7\" picture disk - do they really have to use this cheap gimmick\nto get people to buy their records?' Well it works does-n't it? Anyway this particular band have no need to do\nsuch a thing. Their record is bubbly with a cheeky, cheerful tune surrounded by an ominous presence of something heavy and less innocent in the background.\nI lope fully it will be in my head for some time.\nRachel\nThe Genles - Every Little Thing\nOn the first track the band offer up a happy poppy little number, that is not too dissimilar to Dodgy. Next is\na moody cover of the Who's/ can see for miles, which\nis quite good in all fairness. On the fina i song they manage to sound a lot like Soundgarden did on Black-hole sun. Next time it would be nice if there was a little\ncontinuity.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Daddy's Favourite - / feel good things for you\nThe beginning gives rise to a sense of a complete lack\nof musical creativity as the tune is just a basic rearrangement of the X files theme. Do I leave now before my\nbrain becomes numbed? Although tempting, it is\nworth hanging on in there as the music manifests itself I into something rather more interesting. Halfway\nthrough the epic a jazz piano emerges through the\nmain core of synthetic sounds and slots in s uprising ly well with the groovy drum beat, which is the lifeline of|\nthis piece. An inspiring piece of music.\nRachel\nMucho Macho - The Airport Freeze\nThis is a good piece of electronic music. A latin-style beat\nreally spices the sound up. There's a nice level of\nenergy to this, the beats are not so slow that you feel\nthat you are falling asleep, nor are they so fast that you\nsuspect a heart-attack is going to be induced. This\nwould go down well in a club, but it still has enough\nvariation to allow home listening.\nSebadoh - Flame\nQuite simplistic, but effective. A single beat is pretty\nmuch played th tough the song, with only a single\nbreak. The keyboards match this with a single repetitive scale, with little effects drifting in and out. Over this\nare vaguely bluesy vocals. The song goes nowhere and\nyet is quite good. It would have been nice to have had\nat least another track to listen to however.\nThe Divine Comedy - The Certainty Of Chance\nAnother single stack affair. The actual single has more\ntracks claims the postcard that came with this. The\nsong is sweeping and grandiose (and pretentious),\nand yet all of this is created with only vocals.strings, a piano and some drums. This truly fits the description\nepic. It would also fit right in during the slushy bit in\nmost films.\nRadar - Slow Down\nThis band's take on rock includes a feel-good uplifting\nvibe. Unfortunately, the vocals are of the slightly breathy\nsort that is popular in this style, which are supposed to\nsound emotional,but usually don't. The songs are\nplayed well and have sufficient versatility. It's worth a look for the final track, It ain't over.\nPaul Weller - Brand New Start\nA melancholy song. It's really well written, the lyrics are\nquite good and are reasonably sung. The guitar work\nin particular is not only well done but is also tasteful and\ninteresting. It's good to hear a musician exerting control for once. The new b side is rubbish, probably the\nreason that it is ab side. Also there's a cover of the Jam\nsong, The Riverbank which is pretty cool, but how\nmuch it differs from the original, I don't know.\nMarc Almond - Black Kiss\nNot a bad song - a bit sparse at times - but cool\nnonetheless. The music gets going during the chorus,\nbut during the verses it only occasionally tries to do\nsomething. It's the vocals that make this good, and\nsome sample of a guy talking in a foreign language. The\nb side. Satan's Child, sounds better as more happens\nmusically, whilst maintaining a laid back vibe. Finally\nthere is a live version of Black Kiss, which sounds better than the original due to a denser sound. H Jamie\n\n"

    "content": "9 November 1998 Columns 11\nPresidential Talk-Back\nOver the first few weeks I have had various students come into my office,\nenquiring about their NUS cards, which\nentitle them to student discounts. We\nare not in the NUS, so the logical conclusion is that we can't get their dis-counts. This is right in some cases, but\nnot in the majority; if a company advertises student discounts, then we are entitled to them with an Imperial College\nUnion Card, if they disagree then they\nare falsely advertising.\nlo try and simplify\nsome of the problems, I am putting\na day of my time aside ('Dave's Discount Day' Monday 16th November), in which I will bargain for discounts from any\ncompany that students want\nme to and clarify with others\nthat our cards are acceptable\nto them. So if there are any\ncompany's out there that you\nthink we could pos-David Hellard, ICU President sibi y get a discount\nfrom, or who\nalready supply NUS students\nwith one, but not us, then\nplease email me\npresident@ic.ac.uk with the\ndetails or pop into the office.\nI have also struck a deal with a firm called SNAPfax, who are\nbased in Edinburgh and this\nyear are venturing into London. Next year they will supply us with\ndiscounts across London for free that\nNUS card holders may not be entitled to,\nthey have been very successful in Edinburgh and Manchester and should prove\nto be just as successful in London.\nA Better Life?\n???? Sorry that was me just trying to\nfigure out all... some... o.k. just any\n\u2022 of the advantages of being a student\nand to tell you the honest truth I can't at\nthis precise moment in time think of a single one that's worth mentioning.\nWe're stuck in a traffic jam, (what's new....it's one of the necessary evils of living in London). It's something that I 've\ngot used to. Now, instead of wasting my\ntime getting annoyed and frustrated I use\nthis valuable time to think and reflect,\nbecause let's face it people don't really\nget a lot of time to ponder, due the\nbusy, hectic pace of life.\nI ask my friend (I hate my timing\ntoo..) who is at present in the middle of\na three-point-turn (forward-reverse\nmanoeuvre, we're informed by my\nlearner-driver teenage sister). We're just\non our way to an c xpress o bar (a bit\nposh, I know) in High street Kensington. We're trying to prevent our non-ex is tent-at-the-moment coffee-social life from\ntaking a fatal nose-dive. It's a Eriday night\nand, we've been driving around for forty-five minutes trying to find a parking\nspace but we don't seem to have a hope\nin hell of finding one. I could digress at\nthis point and tell you\nexactly what I think\nabout traffic wardens\nand the lack of parking spaces in fond on but it would be quite\nfruitless and boring\nand beyond the\nscope of this article\nas they say!\nAnyway where was I ah yes I put\nthe question to my friend, who smugly\nreplies \"the three letters, a degree, a better life at the end of\". OK fair enough\nshe has a point but what else? Besides I can't think that far ahead.\nWhat exactly is the advantage of\nbeing broke all the time despite having\na weekend job, a host of supposedly\nlow-interest loans, that monthly life-sav-ing cheque from your parents? It's not\nTHE FINE LINE Dimple Devadas\nas if you get any respect from anyone\neither. It's a well known fact that everyone detests and despises students even\nformer students hate students. You'll\nfind yourself hating\nstudents in time, once\nyou've been pro-$f mote d to the ranks of\nthe therapy-de pen dent elite members of\nsociety.\nThe Virgin cinema\nand music discounts\nin handy though, thanks\nRichard! About time with the underground rail discounts. The other student\ndiscounts in desperate little back str cet non-Rentokil approved restaurants, that\nfail to make it into the 'time-out' guide,\nare something I could quite easily live\nwithout. Who said that being a student\nmeant a care-free-no-worry nonchalant\nexistence? Bills to pay, Idealistic rot as to\nfollow, washing, these are not effortless\ntasks. I 've been known to be so drained\ndo come\nafter an evening spent sorting out the\nphone bill with my flat-mates that I have\nhad to cancel prior engagements.\nSomeone once said that going to\nuniversity means converting an empty\nmind into an open one, wise words... it\nalso means converting a positive bank-balance into a very negative one. All the\nsuffering and anguish in the quest for the\nac quis it on of those three or four letters\nthat are supposed to arm you with the\nammunition to tackle the whole weary-eyed world and set you apart from the\nrest.\nDespite everything, I think most us\ndeep-down, enjoy the once in a life-time\nmasochistic experience. Whenever I feel\ndisillusioned and dispirited I will remember the reassuring words \"a better life at\nthe end of it!\" Ah a parking space is\nrevealed to us not a double yellow\nline ...great. Is it worth it now....? 'What\nthe degree or the coffee?'\nMedicine Matters\nT he medical school is dead, long live\nthe medical school! This sentiment\nwas inspired by a comment that was\nmade at the ICSMSU meeting last Tuesday\nindicating that the first year medics felt a bit left out. I can understand and sym pathis e with their predicament. They arc\ntotally separated from the other IC medics\nwho are based just about everywhere in\nLondon apart from South Kensington and\nat the same time they are separated from\nthe rest of South Kensington by virtue of\nstudying medicine. The medics have no\nhome, no base where they can go and be\nmedics.\nThis is primarily a failing\nof the Alexander Iteming\nbuilding which, for all its\ntechnological sophistication does not\nreally do much to support the medics\npastoral needs. The great thing about\nCharing Cross, St. Mary's and loathe\nthough I am to say it, UCH and King's and\nSt. Thomas' is that they all have medics\nbars whet e you can go and you arc guaranteed to meet other medics. It is zero\neffort social ising, you don't have to explain\nwho you are and what you do, if you walk\ninto the bar the odds are that you will\nknow someone, and even if you don't everyone in the bar under-Nick Newton stands what you have just\nbeen doing and can sym-pathis e if you're on take or if you've just\nhad a crappy day.\nThe medic's SU committee has spent\na lot of time and effort trying to keep\nsomething alive lh at, hard though it is for\nsome of us, myself included, to accept, is\ndead. We cannot go back to the old days\n(I will resist the urge to claim they were\ngood) and I don't think that we should try.\nThe foundation of ICSM is a chance for us\nto create something new, a medical\nschool that is spread across many campuses and yet has a home at IC. This may\nbe politically incorrect from a medic's point of view but it is the only way that this\nyear's first years can hope to get the social\nsupport that they need.\nEveryone from the second years to\nfinal years knows how important this social\nsupport is in the life of a medic. Whether\nit is finding out which lectures to go and\nwhich to miss, or which books to get and\nwhich exams are worth passing, the relationship between the first years and the\nrest of the medical school is vital and is\nmore important than the petty rivalries\ncharacterise in the medical school.\n\n"

    "content": "18 Feature 9 November 1998\nA Taste of India\nSimon Llewellyn provides us with an insight into life in New Delhi, as he tells the story of his first trip to India...\nSitting in the comfort of my environmentally controlled Air France\njumbo jet flight, reading a copy of\nForster's A Passage to India, I realise how\nlittle I know or understand about this\ncountry. Apart from the food and the\ndocumentaries about the slums of Calcutta I am largely ignorant of what lies in\nstore for mc. The taxi driver had given\nme several sage pieces of advice during\nour early morning trip to the airport. It\nwas a grey drizzly morning and I was\nmore than a little apprehensive; \"You've\ngot to watch that lot over there, they're\ndifferent to us. And don't go eating the\nfood either, and the water...\" He later\nreluctantly admitted to never having actually visited Asia.\nFor some reason most flights leaving\nEurope arrive in India at about midnight\nlocal time. There are several theories as\nto why this may be. Some say it is to do\nwith flight path regulations, others say it\nis so flights leave Europe at a convenient time. I have another suggestion;\nit is a clear conspiracy by the Indian airport authority to throw unwitting travelers into the jaws of the locals at a time\nwhen they are tired and suggestible...\nperhaps.\nNew Delhi is the ostentatious, British\nbuilt and designed capital of India and\nalso the arrival point for most visitors to\nthe country. It is a city that has been con-que red, destroyed and rebuilt on many\noccasions during its turbulent history, a city that is impossible to possess, or so\nthe legends would have us believe. Yet\nlittle of this history is evident from\nMahatma Ghandi international airport as\nI find myself queuing up at the immigration counter. The tales of endless\nbureaucracy seem to be a thing of the\npast and within twenty minutes I am\nstanding in the exit lobby, with backpack firmly on, and clutching a prepaid\ntaxi voucher in my sweaty right hand.\nThis voucher scheme was introduced in\nan attempt to stop new arrivals being\nripped off by less than honest taxi drivers.\nAt a booth in the airport you state your\ndestination and amount of baggage and\nare given a voucher valid on any of the\nstandard class taxis, or so the theory\nruns.\nMaking my way outside, an\nentourage of enthusiastic taxi drivers\nsoon encircles me, but when I show the\nvoucher most of them leave di sap pointed. However the one remaining driver helps me with my pack into the back\nof a yellow and black ambassador car;\nthis is the ubiquitous taxi car of New\nDelhi and an instant reminder that India\nused to be under colonial rule. Soon we\nare driving in the middle of the road,\nspeeding round blind corners and forming part of the local car horn orchestra,\nwhich I am later to find makes up the\nmost important part of driving in India.\nUnlike in Europe, where horns are generally used to warn of danger or express\nannoyance, in India they play a far wider\nrole. Atypical honk could me \"Watch out\nI am about to run you over\", \"hello, I 've\ngot a nice horn too\" or may simply be\nsomething for the driver to do with his\nidle left hand in between gear changes.\nBecause of the great importance\nattached to these noisy contraptions, a huge and bewildering array of different\nsounds are available. For the serious\nminded business man the good old boring straight honk is preferred, but for bus\ndrivers, a particularly kamikaze breed, a dazzling array of different tunes are on\noffer. Leading the popularity contest at\nthe moment seems to be the Lambada,\nplayed as a series of beeps which add a strange electronic orchestra feel to traffic jams - an acoustically far more exciting experience than their European\ncounterparts. And believe mc, this is for-tuna te; sitting for hours in traffic jams is\nmore of a way of life than elsewhere.\nNew Dehli has many distinctly different sides to its character. The huge\nIndia gate surrounded by large open\navenues and ornate stately buildings\ncontrasts starkly with the run down narrow streets in which thousands of people sleep every night. Indeed, walking\naround the streets late at night can be a vaguely surreal experience, with lines of\npeople sleeping on makeshift beds\nstretching into the distance. But come\nsunrise a flurry of activity converts these\ndormitories into a flourishing market\nplace, selling everything you can i mag ine, including a large array of different\nspices and small, spiky, insidious looking\nfruits. The range of culinary dishes available is quite staggering and you will\nnever have a problem finding a delicious (if some w hal suspect looking) meal\nto gorge yourself on. Served from large\nblackened pans from street side stalls,\nthese dishes are usually'incredibly good\nas well as very cheap. I sit on a low wall,\ncontentedly munching my way through\na bowl of surprisingly tasty brown sludge,\nand trying not to think of the myriad diseases associated with bad food hygiene.\nIn front of me a constant stream of yellow and black auto-rickshaws weave in\nand out of each other. Somehow, no\nmatter how reckless the driving, they\nnever seem to collide.\nPoverty is, alas, one of the mos l striking things about the city, and in fact the\nentire country. Mutilated beggars with\nold world diseases are common place. It\ncan be hard to adjust to the sight of\nbandaged lepers walking the streets.\nAfter only a few days in the country I already feel overwhelmed, having been\nthrown into such an environment, and\nthis is only the first week of the months\nI have left.\n\n"

    "content": "ft\nLetters 9 November 1998\nIn Counter Attack of\nEstates\nDear Felix,\nFollowing the letter by lan Caldwell, may\nI congratulate you on the response.\nWhere do these people from the Estates\ndivision come from and what on earth\nare they doing in such important positions at Imperial?\nMay I firstly remind lan that although\nthe sums of money involved in the environmental improvements are 'relatively\nsmall in terms of the \u00a360 million of development1 it is still \u00a3110,000, money not to\nbe scoffed at. Furthermore, if the Estates\ndivision is so worried about 'unsightliness1 of the campus, as quoted by Ken\nYoung in issue 1123, why on earth did\nthey allow the plans to go ahead in erecting the unsightly, if not slightly phallic\nmonstrosity more commonly known as\nthe 'temporary' boiler house? No wonder the college has such an 'appalling\nreputation' with the local planning com-mitte e. If the local planning committees\nexpect the Estates 'to act more responsibly', as quoted by lan, then may I suggest that the Estate money would be far\nbetter spent in improving the student\nand staff facilities, such as the common\nrooms in the departments, or the\nappalling kitchen and living facilities in\nstudent halls, rather than on some\nflowerbed - aesthetically pleasing to the\neye maybe - but not a lot else. After all,\nthe college is for the students, staff and\nresearch, not for the birds and the bees\n- although some might like to think - or\nhope so. With Hyde Park just up the\nroad, why do they want to invest in a small flowerbed anyway?\nWell, I 've had my sulk. I'm just glad\nthat the Estates division isn't deciding\nmy future.\nYours,\nRuth\nWhat's This? A Petition?\nMr Editor,\nAssuming that everything printed, theo-re tic ally, has to be approved by your\ngood self, then no doubt you have\nnoticed the recent succession of pieces\nthat have been written about medics.\nMedics are now an integral part of\nImperial College, and as such one would\nexpect to see the odd piece on medics\nevery now again.\nHowever you and your budding\njournalists at Felix for some reason have\ndecided to conduct what appears to be\na systematic campaign, the result of\nwhich is the port ay al of medical students\nin a bad light.\nStarting with your edition on the 2nd of October you claimed that the CXWMS\nunion made a loss of more than \u00a340,000\n, this coming from - \"a source\"-1 seem to\nrecall the tabloids also have similar proclivity as regards the use of these\nunnamed \"sources\". Further more, if my\nmemory serves me right CXWNIS went\nout of existence on 1 August 1997, so\nplease explain how a non existent institution could have a union, I think you will\nfind that the said event was organised by\nICU @ Charing Cross!\nDespite your fal iure to be a har-moni sing and positive influence on the\nrelationship between medics and non\nmedics, you seem happy to proceed to\nthe other extreme of worsening the situation by allowing elements such as the\n\"Voice of Reason.... Simon Baker\" in the\nsame edition of Felix to exacerbate the\nsituation, by being non too complementary about our fellow medical students at Mary's Campus !\nYour distinguished journalist, Andy\nBrown not having been able to think of\nanything interesting to write about (in\ntrue tabloid style) proceeded to put the\nproverbial foot in as regards the financial\narrangements at the Charing Cross ball,\nspecifically about the \u00a385,000 supposedly spent and the \u00a37000 on Champaign\n.... again in true News of the World style,\nthe clear statement by the former Deputy\npresident of the Union, Nick Carter, that\nonly \u00a3600 was spent on Champaign was\nignored because of course \u00a37000 docs\nsound better for the readers, never mind\nthe truth ! Suspect book keeping was also\nalleged despite the offer by Mr Carter to\nallow the books to be inspected, libelous\nif you ask me.\nI and many others think that Nick\nCarter, and Andy Hecps did an excellent\njob for the union and the students and\nas such should be commended for their\ncommitment and dedication.\nNot satisfied by their earlier allegations the issue of October 26 continued\nin the same vein this time the Rugby\nMedics were on the receiving end of\nFELIX journalism.\nYou also couldn't resist mentioning\nthe doctor who just happened to have\nworked at Charing cross hospital getting\n\u00a3500,000 for having an accident with a needle, your head line being rather complementary you forget that this must\nhave involved great personal tragedy to\nspend 5 or 6 yrs at med school only to\nhave to give it up!\nAll this was brought to a head by\nyour sensationalist Tabloid style headline on your most re cnt issue, which at\nfirst sight seems to tar medics, this time\nwith derogatory brush of racism\nwell done Mr Ofori you don't seem\nto have noticed that the maori ty of students at Imperial arc form the Ethnic\nminorities.\nIt is clear that FELIX staff hold medics\nin contempt, and I suggest you should\nmodify this attitude as it doesn't help the\ncurrent undercurrent of friction that\nalready exists between medics and non\nmedics\nIt is in every ones interest that we all\nget along instead of readers being\namused at the expense of medics in a fickle excuse for journalism.\nMr Osa Emohare & the following\nPanorea Parha Nurhayati Lubis\nAdello Pears Reatha-Leigh Pad\nPhilip K.H.

Lee\nPlease see editorial - Ed\nWhy I Should Have\nBeen Shot at Birth\nDear Sir\nI feel compelled into writing following\ncomments made about Medical Students\nin the letters page of issue 1123.\nI agree wholeheartedly with the\ncomments made. I know several first\nyear Medics, and they are so far up their\nrectal passages... [etc etc. - Ed]\nSo, what's the point? Well, the nub\nof the issue is that while doctors are little more than saw bones and quacks, the\nreal donkey work of modern medicine is\ncarried out behind the scenes by\nchemists and medical physicists whose\nwork is rarely acknowledged.\nYours piously\nThe Censors\nYou really are a small and twa tty man/woman/men/women. Please read\nthe editorial, if your brain allows you the\nluxury of reading. - Ed\nThe Return of Heeps\nDear Edward,\nI had planned to maintain a degree of\nsecrecy since my departure from office;\nhowever, your caption competitions, ICU\nCouncil and D Robinson seem to have\nscotched that idea. With reference to\nthe latter two of the aforementioned\narticles, I shall restrain myself to this: the\nBUSA issue is one of the few subjects\nthat stirs up debate within the College,\nand for ICU to treat it with anything less\nthan the utmost urgency would be fool-ish; as for D Robinson, I can categorically\nstate that I do not know that person at\nall, but I would like to thank him for\nover-rating my Presidency so publicly.\nLast week I was asked by the ICSM\nLight Opera Society to represent them at\nan ICU Disciplinary Hearing. The alleged\ncrime was one of putting posters on the\nlecture theatre wall of our brand-spank-ing-new, vastly over-priced greenhouse\non the south of the Queen's Lawn. Upon\nre me oval of the offending items\n(secured with blu-tak and sell o tape) great\nchunks of lecture theatre came away in\nour hard-working cleaners' hands, with\nonly a week until Her Majesty raced\nthrough the building. The architect, Sir\nNorman Foster went ballistic, and con-se que ntl y,a few Pro Rectorial ears were\nbent. Quite apart from the subsequent\nissue of senior College staff instructing\nthe Union how to go about its business,\nit did make me wonder: did we really pay\nat least \u00a380M for a building where the\nwalls could not withstand a few blobs of\nblu-tak and strips of sell o tape? My advice\nto medics and biologists is this: don't sit\nnear a wall in that building without checking its stability first. Or borrow Simon\nBaker's hard hat if you do.\nOne of the more fortunate sides to\nthe ICU Presidency is this: you don't have\nto go near a textbook during your time\nin office. Consequently, trips to the library\nare not really commonplace. So imagine\nmy surprise when I visited the Central\nLibrary last week, clutching a list of medical references to read, only to be told\nthat there were no substantial medical\nacademic journals held on the South\nKensington Campus. Fine. I thought, I 'll\n\n"

    "content": "9 November 1998 Arts 27\nPOETRY INTERNATIONAL1998 Royal Festival Hall\nT his event was billed as \"Britain's biggest and best poetry festival\",\nso I was surprised when, after\npicking up my ticket, I was directed not\nto the main auditorium but to a small\nroom containing about forty chairs and\ntwo lecterns in the upper reaches of the\nFestival Hall complex. The strange neon-scaffolding thing was even visible\nthrough the window at the back. Known\nas \"The Voice Box\", this room makes for\nan intimate, up-close venue. Sat amongst\na varied audience of women's Institute\ntypes, bearded intellectuals and the occasional skinhead, I listened intently to the\nintroductions.\nTonight's performance comprised\nspecially commissioned translations of\nworks by two poets, who arc well known\nand highly regarded in their own country yet almost unheard of over here. Juan\nLuis Panero, from Madrid, writes deeply\nemotional, often erotic pieces. His influences, including cinema, arc regarded as\nmore contemporary than many of his fellow artists. The first poem to be read was\nthe translation of Witness to Ashes, followed by the original Spanish version.\nThis was the form of the entire evening.\nJane Duran, the translator, read her version in steady deadpan American. She\nwas a set of human subtitles, supplement\nPanero's performance - which was\nbreathtaking. His voice, a deep clear\nbass, expressed the passion and motivation behind his poems as much as the\nwords themselves. Some of his poems\nwere deeply philosophical, reflecting on\nexistence, dreams, reality and certainty,\nwhereas others were erotic, sensual and\ntitillating. It was easy to see why his style\nis regarded as unique among Spanish\npoets.\nValerio Magrclli, a lecturer from Pisa\nUniversity, is considered by many to be\nthe finest Italian poet of his generation.\nHis approach is precise and sharp yet at\nthe same time emotionally rich. A selection of his works was read by the trans-lat or, Jamie McKendrick, poet in\nresidence at Hertfield College, Oxford.\nAgain, the poet reading his own creations in his native tongue really brought\nthe poetry to life. Magrelli is technically\ntaut and writes capricious observational\nsketches about his motivation among\nother topics. He describes himself as \"a tailor who uses himself as a roll of cloth\"\nand compares his poems to \"faint ceramics of dreams that flow over onto the\npage\". His strength was thought provoking imagery and incisive observation,\nalthough his performance did not match\nthat of Panero.\nI'm no poetry critic but I enjoyed\nthe evening immensely,- certainly more\nworthwhile and inspiring than drinking six\npints in front of the football. I'm glad I made the effort to go.\nlain\nWITNESS TO\nASHES\nu an Luis Panero\n(translated by\nJane Duran)\nOn the rock that the sea beats\nor on the dry bark of that tree,\nin the wind that cries against glass,\non the footprint in sand, or in hard earth,\nin smoke that vanishes in your hands,\nwrite, write, as if you were still discovering words.\nWrite for skin or stones,\nfor white horses, for those eyes\nthat never looked at you, that you never\nlooked into.\nWrite without pride, but without false\nmodesty,\nhow your passage through this world\nwas not in vain.\nAfterwards, forget that stupid sentence\nand look at the sea, the sails of that boat\ncoming to rescue you, nodding patiently\nover the waves,\nits light reflecting in foam.\nAnd - above all - write when you see it go\nunder,\nwhen it disappears like a dream or a haze,\nwhen it no longer exists - It Is known that\nit never existed -write and repeat it aloud for the deaf sea,\nfor the distant sky.\nSo learn, witness to ashes,\nthe implacable end of your illusory\nlabour,\nand then, without doubting - so your\nhand does not tremble -write, write, write, write.\nTHE EMBRACE\nValerio Magrcll\ntranslated by\nJamie McKendrick)\nAs you lie beside me I edge closer\ntaking sleep from your lips\nas one wick draws flame from another.\nAnd two night-lights are lit\nas the flame takes and sleep passes\nbetween us. But as It passes\nthe boiler in the basement shudders:\ndown there a fossil nature burns,\ndown in the depths prehistory's sunken fermented peat s blaze up\nand slither through my radiator.\nWreathed in a dark halo of oil,\nthe bedroom is a close nest\nheated by organic deposits,\nby log pyres, leaf mash, seething resins...\nAnd we arc the wicks, the two tongues\nflickering on that single Palaeozoic torch.\nREAL CLASSY AFFAIR\nRoyal Court Theatre Upstairs\nReal Classy Affair is Nick Grosso's new play. He has already\nreceived a lot of praise for his\ntwo previous works Peaches and Stveefheart which were also sucessfully staged\nat the Royal Court Theatre. This \"affair\"\nfollows the lives of five childhood friends\nin Finsbury, North London. They are all\nnow approaching thirty and one of them,\nStan has recently married and wants to\nmove with his wife to Streatham into\nthe flat his Nan left empty when she\ndied. The scene opens in a pub; the lads\nwalk in, all dressed in the exactly the\nsame way - wearing a bright, flashy suit.\nOnly Billy stands out because his costume is a different colour. We later discover that he has been away for a while.\nThey start talking about beer, women\nand other la dish topics. It's very funny,\nwith Joey collecting rounds of drinks and\nreturning every time with the most hilarious stories about women approaching\nhim and asking him out. Harry, on the\nother hand, is the quiet, shy one who's in love but won't admit it. Finally, there\nis Tommy, the guy in charge; he seems\nto control them all. I rom the way he\ncomes across, he probably was the\nleader of the crowd when they were\nkids. The set then alternates between the\nbe her best friend... Since his return, Billy\nis constantly fighting with Tommy; they\nconstantly show off in front of the o th ers, trying to prove who's the boss.\npub and Stan's flat, where Louise, his\nwife is always ironing. As the play\nunfolds, we discover that Tommy has\nslept with Louise and that Billy seems to\nAll this confrontation makes for quite\na realistic observation of this particular\nclass of society. The blok es have it all\nsus sed out. But underneath this macho\nattitude towards life, they are very vulnerable and full of insecurity. Harry feels\nso relieved when he finally admits to his\nbeing in love. They are pressured into\nbehaving a certain way, often this burden\ncomes from within their own little group\nand from the strains of friendships. They\nare scared to death of disappointing one\nanother. The arrival of a woman also disrupts their peace,- she takes one of them\naway and then dares to fool around with\na couple of others.\nI enjoyed this play very much, mostly\nthanks to the actors. I hey arc all part of\nthe new generation: Lisa Walker (also\nseen in Closer) proving she is brilliant on\nstage, Joseph tienne s, easily as talented\nas his brother and Jason Hughes following his success in This Life.\nD.

    "content": "9 November 1998\nROBBIE WILLIAMS\nI 've Been Expecting You\nKB\nHello, my name's Robert.\nRobbie Williams? Don't disregard\nthis album. Ok, his first solo\nalbum didn't do too well at first\nbut eventually got to number one. This\none has the potential to do better much\nmore quickly. This is probably due to\nthe success of his recent single\nMillennium. On first listening you think,\n'not sure about that' then you listen to\nit again and it begins to grow on you.\nBefore you know it you are singing\nalong and tapping your feet. Sad but\ntrue!\nListening to the opening track for the\nfirst time had me thinking I was listening\nto Oasis. The intro sounds so similar to\nany old Oasis song. Sampled from the\nBond film You Only Live Twice, Robbie\nputs his 'favourite strings part ever!' into\nMillennium. The distinctive vocals of Neil\nTennant (The Pet Shop Boys) come\nthrough in No Regrets, who is one of the\nguests on this album along with Nicole\nAppleton (All Saints)\nMost of the songs are easy to listen\nto and will never be hits in their own right\nexcept maybe Jesus In A Camper Van.\nThe album is definitely improved by the\ntwo hidden tracks if you wait long\nenough at the end of the album.\nRobbie has now definitely left his\nTake That days behind him and moved\non by appealing to a wider audience. His\nlyrics are definite a sign of long awaited\nmaturity and he is establishing himself as\na reputable songwriter. The album is\ninfluenced by a Bond theme but is he\ngoing to be the new James Bond?\nStranger things have happened, you\nknow. Do you remember that blok e who\nleft a successful pop band to start a solo\ncareer? H Helen\nPJ HARVEY\nIs This Desire?\nPJ Harvey. Have they expired?\nSo often I'm written about as a sort of dark, black-magic witch, a sort of man-hating axe-wielding\ncow from hell was what PJ I lar vey said\nin a recent Big Issue interview-an opinion that many may stick with in light of\nher latest offering, Is This Desire?\nAlthough some of the tracks here\nsuggest something of the new-found\nhappiness that she professes to have,\nsome are as angry as anything she has\ndone before. The lyrics to Joy ate shouted\nout whilst the heavily distorted monotonic bass gives a real feel of aggressive\ntension. My Beautiful Leah is also characterised by its ditty bass and although\nmore subdued than Joy it is equally as\ngrim with lyrics such as 'She only had\nnightmares. And her sadness never\nlifted'.\nVirtually every song on the album\nhas references to other people, all with\ndifferent problems: My Beautiful Leah\nwho is 'better off dead', Catherine who\nT damn to Ile ll' and another Catherine\nwho dreams of 'children's voices and\ntorture on the wheel.' Although it could\neasily be the case that all these people\nare acquaintances, it seems more likely\nthat they ate names given to her different emotions and moods. This is first suggested by the opening line of the whole\nalbum where she sings 'My first name\nAngelene,' hinting that her other characters maybe pseudonyms too.\nDespite the mostly downbeat lyrics,\nthe music isn't generally correspondingly\ngloomy. Joy and My Beautiful Leah are\nboth at the extreme end of the albums\nmusical spectrum. It is notable that these\ntwo songs are both proceeded by totally\ncontrasting songs that have a definite\nfunk in ess to them. Indeed, The Wind is\nvaguely reminiscent of U2's Lemon, with\nstrings that could have been lifted off a Propellerheads album. This does a lot to\nraise the mood of the album as a whole,\nmaking it considerably more easy to listen to.\nThe single A Perfect Day Else\n(play listed on IC Radio) is the most heavily layered song on the entire album,\nand the most chart friendly. The synthesised bass sound is the biggest clue to\nthe sound of the rest of the album,\nalthough like the mood of the song in\ngeneral, it sounds much more tamed\nand chirp y. Is This Desire?should not disappoint\nfans of PJ Harvey. Musically, it is richly\ncontrasting, although it does occasionally\npush the boundary too much towards\nthe dark side for most peoples tastes.\nDon't expect to see her on Top of the\nPops, n Jonny Pants\n\u2022 voice ol vocalist jr\nine ' r, ft: nan ship into < or np osi follow iV li\n. 1\n:MC iV::o\\ er! asl, ' :n,,,. lii ||v,|e atmosphere\nhere has ak. bound to in\nfor e tr, ot i bands shot\nis a;,;(>< id '\nri:.;;. \u2022.,\u2022,';(.,\nyou oil Inn\nill! , 1 V V which\nBooing on\nRent may not be one\nhands tint g tab Hi \u2022 head lit11. i nod good, as well When you find\nyourself tl l ul ng 'In .In tu s at !

    "content": "12\nBooks & Cartoon 9 November 1998\nThe Custodians\nNicholas Jose Picador\nWhenever I pick up a book as thick as the\nCustodians, a500 page epic, my mind\nalways travels back to the summer that I spent reading Anna Karenina, the less\nfamous but equally brilliant 'little sister' of\nWar and Peace, and I always wonder\nwhether the aut or of this new book will\nin any way achieve the same depth of\nimmersion into the world of the characters in the book. On this occasion at\nleast, I was more than satisfied.\nIn a word, the Custodians is brilliant.\nA remarkable fic tonal account of a group\nof friends who grow up together in the\nsuburbs of Adelaide in Australia, brought\ntogether from disparate backgrounds,\nfrom the we lath of landowners to the\npoverty of refugees. The story begins in\nthe 1960's. with Jane, Wendy, fls pe th, Alex, and Ziggy,\nthe refugee\nfrom Lithiania.\nAt school, they\nknow each\nother well, but\nas they grow up\nand head on\ninto adulthood,\nthey all make\nvery different\nlife choices, leading\nthem into situations and ',:.:.*..;.\"\nexperiences that they ;.\ncould have never\ndreamed of in the early\ndays. Then there is j oise, the Catholic girl\nwho cannot go out in the sun, and Clcve,\nthe Aborigine, stolen from his parents by\nthe White men's welfare, adopted by a white family as a token gesture to thank\nGod for there own son, and then packed\noff to a boarding school, i mcr sedin to a racist world where he was not welcome,\nand with no roots of his real origins to\nhold onto.\nParallel to the story of these friends\nruns the s troy of Daniel, another Aborigene, stolen from his parents and sent\nfrom institution to institution, then to\n\u2022Sip\npris ion,a young\nboy, given no\nopportunity to live,\nand cursed for it by\na society that\nbe lives that Blacks\nshould be made-white, 'for their\nown sake1 and\nClove's twin\nbrother.\nWith a depth\nof know ld ge of a myriad of facets of\nsociety, and using\nreal life events,\nemotions and details of governmental\nactions, Nicholas Jose weaves a story\nthat sees these chr act ers meet up time\nand time again, their lives becoming\nmore entangled the further, apart they\nthink thay are going. The main purpose\nof the story is a comment of the treatment of the Aborigines by the Colonialists, and an examination of who Australia,\nand indeed the whole world really\nbelongs to. The friends grow up in a society that claims to be right, but which\nis essentially white, seeing the Aborigines\nas secondary citizens and believing that\nit is in everyones interests to eliminate\nany culture other then theirs. But then\nthe friends reach adulthood and become\nthe new Custodians of Australia, and\nthey have to decide what is right for the\nfuture, and how the wrongs of the past\ncan be atoned. Should land taken by\nthe Colonists be given back to the Aborigines, or should it become land for\neveryone, making no distinction\nbetween cultures, letting the world\ninherit Australia, rather than those who\nhappened to be born there.\nThe plot involves a sustained political debate about the Aboringines and-Colonialists, and the more general\ndebate about minority suppression, but-not in an over pow ring way, and also\nfinds time to examine real tion ships, and\nlove, the characters deciding what Is\nmost important to them. The plot climaxes (as would be expected!) at the\nend, in a meeting of plots tha does the\nauthor credit and which closes the story\nin the ideal way.\nNo review can really give you a feel\nof what it's all about though. Go and read the book - it's \u00a37.99 well spent!\nSimon Brennan\n\n"

The first ten minutes proved\nto be fruitless, with a missed penalty\nand a disallowed try. In the 20th minute\nthe floodgates opened with a magnificent forward try scored by no. 8 Charlie\nCurre. Dave God scored the second try\nfrom open play in the 30th minute. After\n35 minutes #8 Chucks struck again and\nfinally the first conversion was planted\nsweetly between the posts. Minutes\nlater Nipply scored with aerial acceleration bring in the half to a close at 22-0.\nMerely seconds after kick-off, Chucks\nbrawled in again under the posts, notch-3rd XV\nalso Sponsored by Unilever\nIC 10- 14 UCL\nIt was a time of heros. A time when boys\nput away the toys of childhood and\nbecame true men. It began as a war of\na ff licit ion with the forwards dominating\nand the IC squad camped on the UCL\nline. The backs attributed themselves\nwell despite the scrappy conditions, with\ngood tackling and defending by James\nNotaies and Tim Jones on their debuts.\nThe score line at the end of the first half\nwas a creditable 0 - 0 . This, however,\ning up his hat trick, which was converted\nby Chris Dickenson once again.\nMoments later scrum half Gabriel scored\nover an open try-line to land beautifully\nunder the posts, neatly converted by\nclub captain Dave Hogg. In the 55th minute Dan \"Pharoah\" Higazi rumbled\nthrough the entire pack to put himself on\nthe scoreboard, con vere tcd by Chris\nDickenson once again. IC then had a15 minute drought (during which Greenwich scored a lucky try, but failed to con-vert) until the mighty Kaizer (60th minute\nsub.) dragged two of the opposition\nover the line to get his first try of the sea-son. Will Stenns converted and then put\nthe last try past Greenwich in the 71st minute using his silky skills.\nAndrew Little\nwas not due to continue. Two quick\nbackline tries in succession put IC an\nunfortunate 14 points behind, within the\nopening 5 minutes. IC rallied after this\nshocking start, scoring themselves from\nsome sexy support play and silky running\nby Dave White, eventually touching\ndown just by the 5m line and unfortunately the conversion was put just wide\nof the posts by the novice kicker, Jamey\nNotaie. Another well worked piece of\nforward play resulted in Joe Robinson\ngoing in just wide of the posts. Again\nthe conversion was missed. Bad luck\nJimmy. All in all an equal match which\nunfortunately ended in the wrong result.\nWomen's Rugby\nIC Virgins 10-10 UCL\nAfter the trashing IC received at the\nhands of UCL last year, we approached\nthe match with some trepidation.\nDespite the fact that IC were three players short and gave away a try in the first\n5 minutes, we fought back well with a superb run and try from Clare B. to even\nthe scores.\nA brilliant move form UCL, in which\n2 of their players tripped over each other\nand twisted their ankles, evened the\nnumbers. IC then spent the whole of\nthe second half camped on UCLs try\nline. Despite the forwards getting the\nball down over the line, the ref did not\nsee and the sustained pressure led to\nanother try by Claire. UCL scored just\nbefore the final whistle to even the\nscores.\nSpecial mention to Claire S. against\nher old team and Jen for carrying on with\nan injury. Thanks to Matt for the coach-ing.\nNetball\nIC 70 - 1 Wye\nAfter a delayed start due to the late\narrival of Wye College, and having to\nclear the water logged court, IC were raring to go.\nAfter a few minutes It became clear\nthat Imperial were going to triumph\nAGAIN, extending their unbeaten record\nthis term.\nThe in fail able accuracy of the shooters Sally (with her shoot-better hair cut)\nand Rebekah (scoring even when the GS\nwas off the court), ensured a comprehensive victory of 70 goals to IC, 1 by\nWye College.\nGood luck in future matches!\nHockey\nist XI\nIC 5 - 0 St. Georges\nThe game was a com let e mess at the\nstart with a pair of umpires that did not\nhave a clue, with everyone deeding to\nmake up their own rules. Jambo Bwana\nfinally brought his shooting stick with\nhim and after going past several defenders slipped a delightful bail past the\nstranded keeper.\nDespite some top notch goals there\nstill remained the shocking misses and\na scrappy one from the hat trick man\nJambo, combined with some of the best\numpiring around (get the impression\nmore than one person is writing this\nreport? - Gus). The score could have\nbeen much higher but Noddy did his\nbest to keep it down, firstly by deflecting a goal ward bound shot right on the\nline, then by missing two complete sit-ter s. By half time, IC were in a commanding 3-0 lead and the second half\nstarted in an equally one sided style.\nThe umpiring began to improve\napart from the ref's language which got\nworse and worse, especially with reference to Big Titties. IC contrived to dominate the game and even started to\nenjoy it!\nDisco Squad\n(formerly 3rd XI)\nIC 0 - 0 UCL\nBefore I start the report I would just like\nto establish that Fabio looks good with\nhis towel on his head and his tackle\nswinging in the breeze.\nWell, we played UCL that is the Harlington astro and they were scum. But\nthey were scum that equalled our\nmighty hockey talents.\nIn a well matched game play\nbobbed back and forth more often than\nJokers' head on a Saturday night in Soho.\nThe disco attack force came close\non many occasions. Lager Lager, known\nfor constantly slapping the post, lived up\nto his reputation. The Sundance Kid\nfought from the wings and Indian Carpet Catalogue dealt as well as he could\nwith a defender who earned his nickname of \"the Flying Lumberjack\".\nPete Tong as ever defended his\nentrance with a fanatical zeal. Nice.\nAnd finally: (To the tune of Urn\nBongo in a disco style)\nHere comes BAPS, he's got VD\nWe know c oz CASANOVA said\n\"He got it off me!\"\nDISCO BOYS!\nI thank you.\nX Country\nImperial put out an awesome men's team but again was lacking a women's team.

Visually this film\nis spectacular and the good news is that\nit has a plot to match.\nSet in the world of an ant colony,\nWoody Allen is the voice of our unlikely\nhero; a measly worker ant called Zee.\nThese ants are humans in ant bodies but\nthey do retain some of their ant characteristics. It's a case of 'boy meets girl boy\nloses girl boy gets girl again and saves\nthe day'. \"Oh no not again!\" you shout\nbut this is different. They're ants for a start\nand there is no soppy stuff. Even though\nthis film is for kids Antz is sending out all\nthe right comedic signals to young and\nold alike. These ants forget what they are\nwhen it comes to the jokes, as most of\nthe gags are deliberately poking fun at\ninsects.\nThere is a star-studded line up of\nvoices including Sylvester Stallone as a dumb soldier ant, Jennifer Lopez as a worker ant, Gene I lack man as an evil\ngeneral; Dan Akroyd and Christopher\nWalkern turn up as well. All the voices are\ncast extremely well but Danny Glover'sll lli True love between one bug and another. How sweet.\nvoice, as Barbados the soldier, is the\none that stands out the most.\nIt is definitely a Woody Allen film for\npeople who don't like Woody Allenespecially if you can't stand the sight of\nhim.

IC were under the co sha little in the\nfirst half and after 25 minutes LSE were\nawarded a penalty. Rob was adjudged\nto have handled the ball despite not\nknowing anything about it. Eric then produced a brilliant score only for the ref to\nmake LSE take it again.\nAfter an inspiring team talk at half-time, IC came out like a team posse sed for the second half. It wasn't long\nbefore we equalise d. Rich was hacked\ndown on the edge of the area. Warren\nfloated the resulting free kick to the\nnear post and Phil rose like a salmon to\nlevel the game. 10 minutes later IC\nwere in front. Till going on a McManaman style run, laid the ball off to Warren\nwho lashed the ball into the top corner.\nIC continued to dominate but failed to\nbuild on their lead and sure enough, two\nminute from time, the jam my bastards\nfrom LSE did It again.

BUSA\nAs usual, we won, they lost. I low c ver, they didn't just lose,- they bore the brunt of\nthe Fourth's most impressive performance of the season, and were thrashed into\nsubmission by a team seemingly possessed by the spirit of Brazil 1970.\nThe pressure built in the first half, with a shot off the inside of their post and\na shot blatantly handled on the line, but with the ref still in the wrong half our calls\nfor a penalty were ignored. Justice came with a fantastic diving header - albeit by\na GKT defender - which put us one up at half-time.\nAnd so the floodgates opened. I he GKT team was helpless In defending wave\nafter wave of out attacks and just as Moses parted the Red Sea IC pulled apart the\nGKT defence by their vision and movement. I'm sure Adam, Gurn, Tom and some\nothers must have scored to guarantee our passage into at least the BUSA Shield,\nthough the BUSA Cup must be our ultimate aim.\nIC 1 - 3 KCL III\nSat 31st October '98. ULU Division III\nCongratulations must go to the Kings who won this fiercely contested battle of Ihe\ntwo most social teams in ULU sports. Following King's Fourths promotion and King's Thirds relegation, KCL Thirds have taken over the prestigious mantle of being the\n\"Badgers\" of Kings College. Most of our previous encounters ended up being game,\n\"set\" and match to the Baiters from IC, but this year they were just that little bit too\nstrong for us.\nFollowing a trip down the Arches Ricky turned up very late resulting in him missing the kick-off so we had to shuffle our troops and move John into midfield. Unfortunately things never quite worked out and we found ourselves two goals down\nvery quickly. When Ricky finally did turn up we started to improve and it was his\nback post corner that was clinically volleyed home by Aidcn. Back in the game and\nafter an inspiring team talk at half-time the fourths started to put together long periods of pressure on the Badgers' goal. It was thus a bitter blow when a swift counter\nattack resulted in that Scouse Twat heading home unmarked from just a few yards\nout. But where was the 'keeper?\nThis defeat was even harsher considering the bad press between the two teams\nfollowing their accusation that we've stolen their t top hy.

The first\nyear medic was admitted to St Mary's Hospital that morning and died in the\nearly evening. The depth of shock\nthroughout IC has been reflected in university campuses nation-wide as the dangers presented by the lethal bacteria hit\nhome. The funeral took place on Saturday 31 October and was well attended by\nnumerous students and college representatives. After spending only one night of the\npreceding week on college premises,\nthe student was found to be unwell on\nWednesday morning, complaining of a headache and stiff neck. Within ten minutes of the discovery, the hall warden\nrequested an ambulance under inspection of the health centre. On admittance to St Mary's many of the other\nsymptoms of meningitis developed.\nThe loss of life has truly been a cruel\nblow to the college and has overwhelmed many; a re-app from the individuals hall commented \"he was really\nBy the News Team\ncalm and quiet, very smiley and friendly\".\nChris Edwards, Principal of ICSM, told\nFelix \"We are all very upset at his death.\nThis is a real tragedy.\"\nThe hall warden concurred; \"I le was\na friendly and popular student and the\nshock of his loss will be felt by many of\nhis friends in hall, in the medical school,\nthroughout College and at home. Our\nthoughts are with his family at this time.\"\nHe went on to pay tribute to the hall\ncommunity; \"I'd like to thank my sub-war-dens, re-apps and all the students in the\nhall for their thoughtful and mature\nresponse through this difficult time.\"\nThe college has duly activated its\nnewly constructed response regime. The\nsystem takes into account the retrospective advice from Southampton and\nCardiff, both of whom have experienced\noutbreaks. Government recommendations formed the basis of the action plan,\nwhich details the network of com muni cation, along with a chain of responsibility that takes effect in the event of a suspected case.\n\"People have to continue to think\nabout meningitis until the spring,\" was\nthe precautionary advice from Dr Irene\nWeinreb, Director of Clinical Services at\nthe health centre. There has been a concerted effort within the college to allay\nstudents' fears through education and\navoid a potential wave of panic, which\nhas for the most part been successful. A small minority of students have returned\nhome as a result of recent events, but it\nis believed these actions were instigated\nby the parents. Dr Weinreb was keen to\nappease worried parents, but discouraged their late night phone calls, which\nonly serve to cause disruption. The ICSM\nPrincipal described his conference with\nthe hall's students, explaining \"I told\nthem to speak to their parents and let\nthem know what had happened. It is\nimportant to understand why it is not\nappropriate for students to go home,\neven though that may be an understandable reaction. The college has a policy for dealing with meningitis. It is\nmuch more sensible for people to stay\nat college where we have the best possible knowledge and understanding of\nthe situation. At St Mary's Hospital we\nalso have, right by us, a national centre\nfor dealing with meningitis.\"\nThe college has extended its condolences to the family and is prepared to\nprovide support for them and its stu-dents. The warden has maintained contact with the family and the way in which\nhe has dealt with the situation was commended by the ICSMU President, Wade\nGaycd, as \"absolutely brilliant\".\nEdinburgh and Newcastle have\ntaken an especially keen interest in the\ndevelopments at IC due to similar,\nthough less grave, cases at their campuses this term.\nFacts about Meningitis on Page 2\nInside..\nLetters 6\nEditorial 8\nColumns 10\nBooks & Cartoon 12\nComputer Games 13\nFilm 14\nMusic Feature 16\nFeature on Delhi 18\nMusic 20\nArts 26\nSport 30\nDiversions 31\nCrossword 32\nMundane Hustings Hassle Cook\nThe prospect of an easy victory for Stuart Cook in this week's elections for\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies) has\nbeen thrown into doubt after a dubious\nshowing at last week's hustings.\nAlthough poor turnouts at both the\nSouth Ken and Charing Cross campuses\nproduced inconclusive results, Mr Cook\nfaced a much sterner test from the\nassembled crowd at St Mary's on\nWednesday. The proceedings were\ntopped-off by Mr Cook's admission that\nafter five years of his materials degree,\nhe had decided to run \"because I'm a bit\nbored\".\nMost questioning concerned the\nfuture of the Medical teams in sporting\ncontests. Mr Cook had clearly done his\nhomework, explaining the current situation regarding the BUSA and UL entries.\nWhen questioned, he explained that\n\"whilst ideally the Med School and IC\nwould enter as two separate teams, that's just not going to happen because we're\nall one College\". For non-sporting teams,\nhowever, he did pledge to listen to the\nBy David Roberts\nviews of the teams concerned.\nAsked at the Charing Cross hustings\nabout the future of IC's three sports\ngrounds, Mr Cook responded that \"I believe we can keep all three\". When\nasked which of the three he would get\nrid of if forced to decide, he replied \"the\nsmallest one\" - which in practice would\nmean Teddington, the ground formerly\nhome to St Mary's. By Wednesday\nevening, however, he had toned down\nthis response, stating that it is \"not a decision I can take right now\".\nLooking at the suggestion that the\nUnion should form a separate \"Athletics\nUnion\" to administer sports clubs - an\noption which could result in increased\nfunding for sports - Mr Cook stated that\nhe would favour such a split. When asked\nif that would mean a concerted effort on\nhis behalf to push ICU Council in that\ndirection, he simply replied \"I guess so\".\nThese hustings could, however,\nprove academic, as suspicion is growing\nthat Mr Cook may withdraw his candidature. Thursday's meeting of ICU Executive was asked to approve Mr Cook's request to be allowed, if elected, to take\nevery Wednesday afternoon off, so that\nhe can continue his membership of the\nfootball team. Although he refused to be\ndrawn into a direct answer on the sub-j ect, expectations run high that if they\nrefuse his request - as widely predicted\n- then he will withdraw from the election.\nVoting, if happening, takes place\ntoday and tomorrow. Ballot boxes are\nopen from 10-5; results are announced\non Tuesday evening in DaVinci's. "

    "content": "9 November 1998 Games 13\nDune 2000\nVirgin Interactive\nSix long years has passed since the\ngrand-daddy of RTSG (real-time strategy\ngames), Dune 2, first burst upon our 14-inch VGA monitors. That translates\nroughly to a century in cyber-tl me, considering the quantum jump in computer\nperformance. If that is the case, then\nwhat is about Dune 2000\u2122, which is\nessentially a remake, not a sequel to the\nWestwood, that can move the hearts of\nus gamers?\nNostalgia is one. For the uninitiated,\nDune 2 is THE GAME in 1992, pioneering\nthe concept of real-time war-gaming.\nThe storyline for both games have\nremained essentially the same - the\nvicious Harkonnen, the insidious Ordos\nand the noble Atreides, fighting to gain\ncontrol of Spice, the only valuable\nresource of the planet Arrakis. The similar setting instantly places old gamers on\nfamiliar ground. Units have remained\nmostly unchanged, i.e. the stealthy Sonic\nTank, gas-spewing Deviator and good\nold Devastator still hang around. The\nEngineer and the Thumper are new units,\nallowing the capture of enemy buildings\nand subsequent production of enemy\nhigh-tech units. On the whole, the\nHarkonnens are slow but a tough nut to\nc tack; the Ordos move snap pl ly but pay\nthe price with weak armour and the\nAtreides, a compromise between the\ntwo.\nWhat about gameplay then? The\ninterface has changed to a Red Alert\nstyle with a Construction and Unit sidebar on the right. However, this means a serious drop in game speed since you\ncan only build one unit at one time,\nwhereas having 2 Heavy Factories in\nDune 2 would have allowed the construction of 2 units concurrently. Moreover, the lack of a building queue\ncoupled with the frequent out-of-stock at the Starport means that it takes an annoying long time to build up your base.\nNonetheless, the addition of FMV,\nwhich boasts John Rhys-Davies of Wing\nCommander and TV show Sliders fame\n\u2022 fk.\nand the inclusion of numerous music\nsoundtracks certainly make Dune 2000\nshine compared to its predecessor.\nYou've got to see the Hollywood-style\nexplosion when your Harvester hits a Spice Mound.\nPerhaps the most important feature,\nbesides the ability to form teams, the\nInternet multiplayer option. This will gives\nthose of us the chance to see how good\nwe really are, given the same units in\n1992.\nThe final word? If you are desperate\nfor the latest in RTSG gameplay. go for\nStarcraft. If you wish lo relive the good\nold days of Dune 2, then go ahead and\nbuy the game. By the way, look out for\nthose tank-gobbling Sandworms.\nRonny Tan\nSpellcross News\nWell, when I got the demo of this game,\nwhich I knew nothing about and had\nnever heard of before, I said \"Ah, must\nbe one of these no-good excuses of a strategy game from desperate companies who try to stay alive\". But I was mis-taken, at least partially. What Spellcross\nis all about is a fight between the Alliance\n(i.e. Mankind) against the Forces of Darkness (i.e. These ugly ores who try to\ndominate the land). As far as its scenario in concerned, it is OK - a bit common but with several interesting \"peaks\nof originality\". As far as its technical part\nis concerned, well, I only need mention\nthat it is a DOS based game (or at\nleast the demo is); that's right, no\nDirectX, no fancy stuff, just plain old\nDOS. I must admit, though, that for\na DOS-based game, it has ta th cr good graphics and sound (unfortunately, the demo only included a monotonous tune so the only good\nidea I have about the sound of the\ngame is from the video part of the\ndemo).\nGame-play is another matter; if\nyou like having like thousands of\ncontrols, you'll\nlike it. If on the\nother hand, you\nike straightforward games\nwhere your only\nchoices are\nselect, move and fire,\nyou will probably hate\nit. It tries to follow\nMicrosoft's as-real-as-it-gets strategy and so\ngives you lots of\noptions and lots of\ncontrols.\nNow, to be more specific, in Spellcross, you have the ability to invent new\ntechnologies and produce new (and\nbloodier) units (sounds all TOO familiar,\ndoesn't it). You can also do research of\nsome sort, but I'm not so sure how that\nhelps you. The good part, though, is that\nonce you have made up your army and\nare ready to attack, you are taken to\nanother interface where you actually\nplace your units on a map and play the\nattack all the way - so you can't blame the\ncomputer if you actually lose all your\nunits. That's probably the best and\ncoolest feature of Spellcross.\nOverall, I found Spellcross an OK\nway to pass your spare time, if you like\nstrategy games, that is. It has lots of\nunits (about 70 or so) so you really have\nlots of options, but it also requires that\nyou think your way through, so I do not\nrecommend it to thOse who just want to\nseat in front of their PC and start shooting people around with mini guns and\nBFGs.\nNick Dalgiannakis\nSin Bin\nThose nice guys from activision have\ngiven us some sin stuff in a nice red\nfolder.

So Why Can't We?\nName: U2\nTitle: The Best of 1980-1990\nRating: 83%\nWho's the geezer on the left?\nOK, so here's a brief history of the band that's sold more than 70 million records worldwide,\ntarry Mullen, 14, posted a notice at Mount\nTemple Comprehensive School in Dublin, which said he\nwanted to form a band. Paul Hewson, 16, used to\nscribble song lyrics between pumping petrol at a station and decided to join, later changing his name to\nBono-after a local hearing aid shop. Others joined and\nthe band Feedback was formed. Bono tried his luck as\nguitarist and band manager before settling for front-man's duties. They won their school talent competition\nin 1976 and changed their name to The Hype, then U2\n- name suggested by a mate called Steve. They signed\nto Island records in 1980 and began a decade of international success unrivalled by anyone not from America. It took them just 3 years to be voted 'best band on\nthe planet' and a further four to release the fastest selling album in American history, The Joshua Tree, an\nalbum that went on to sell over 1S million worldwide.\nAnd that's not to mention the '90's. Which is right,\nbecause this album has nothing to do with the '90's, except for the recent Cher-beaten remake Sweetest\nThing, This Best Of... comprises 14 tracks which - as on\nmost compilations - refuse to be placed in chronological order. As ever, the big hits come first.\nU2's first album, 1980's Boy, was a seminal debut\nthat failed to make the Top 40. We are given a taste of\nthis first attempt with the single / Will Follow. It reveals\nBono's vocal influence, half Spandau Ballet, half The\nCure. Whilst on tour in America the next year, all of\nBono's lyrics for the next album were stolen. A hastened\nrewrite produced October, their less-than-impressive fol-low-up. Wisely, no songs from it are included here. It\nwas their 1983 No. 1 album War that catapulted U2 to\nstardom with their first anthem New Year's Day and the\nanti-violence military chant of Sunday Bloody Sunday.\nNext year's The UnForgettable Fire wasn't as hit-filled but\nstill gave them their biggest hit to date with Pride (In\nThe Name OF Love).\nIt was the greatly-anticipated The Joshua Tree in\n1987 that gave us U2's best loved songs of the decade\nand this compilation's undoubted highlights. With Or\nWithout You takes a lifetime to grow - the intro not\nunlike the tranquil music in Bill & Ted's future. Bono's whispering vocals eventually giving way to the roar of\n'And you give yourself away...' / Still Haven't Found What\nI'm Looking For is probably their most epic to date - T have scaled these city walls only to be with you' and\nWhere The Streets Have No Name, the song that took\nmany months to pet fec t in the studio, is quite frankly\nsuperb.\nTheir last release of the decade was the infamous\nRattle & Hum. Accompanied by a video of live footage\nand backstage madness ('We were probably the worst\nrock 'n' roll stars there ever was') it was considered by\nmany as a step in the wrong direction, taking a more\nbluesy approach - B.B. King was brought in for When\nLove Comes to Town. It gave them their first No. 1 with\nthe let's do-the-hand-jive INXS-style Desire.\nOf course, they went on to release many more\ngreat singles such as One and Even Better Than The Real\nThing before last year's Pop campaign. No doubt we'll\nbe hearing The Best Of The '90's before long, although\nthe band are against a warts-'n' all Anthology style\nrelease.\nFor the U2 faithful out there, there is a limited edition version of this album, complete with an extra CD's worth of B Sides from the mid- to late-80's. Officially, this\nis only available until the end of today, so you'd best\nhurry. Of interest on this extra CD are covers of Everlasting Love - later made famous by Gloria\nEstefan, Unchained Melody, and the\noriginal not-very-good version\nof Sweetest Thing.\nInevitably, this CD is\nY our response to this album will depend on how\nfar back your musical memory goes and what\nsort of Depeche Mode background you have.\nSince the late eighties, I have had an enduring taste for\nDepeche Mode and having enjoyed a few songs off\ntheir last album, I looked forward to listening to this collection of singles which is basically a remastered version of an LP by the same name released in 1985 with\na couple more tracks thrown in. I wanted to know if I would discover some long-forgotten jewels from their\nearly stages that would set my heart on fire for the\ngenius of four blok es from Basildon.\nWell now I 've listened to it, I can say that I liked it\nbut didn't discover as many jewels as I would have liked.\nThe album contains music that captures the essence of\nBrit eighties pop: synth-based sound, catchy tunes,\ngood lyrics and trademark delivery. The\nName. Depeche Mode\nTitle: The Singles 81 -85\nRating: 69%\n+\n.+ w+* songs on this album contrast sharply\nI MOW tld ti yS/ with t ne more expensive studio-polished sound of later\n- art l lOre BeSI Ot... albums W& Music For the\nMasses. A lot of pe o'e thought DM\nwere wrong to\ndrift from the\nin sophisticated but\ncharming\nsimplicity\nyou find in\nthis album.\nI can't make up\nmy mind if I agree or\nZt:T \u00b0ZT/ compi la tig about than\nalbum released in\nthe same week\nOasis' The\nMasterplan.\nAnyway,\ngo out and\nbuy this\nalbum now\nand you\ntoo (sorry!)\ncan experience the\n'80's greatest\nsurvivors.\nEdJ.\nthere are Charles and Diana books. It\nseems that everyone's having a go. U2,\nDepeche Mode, The Orb. Even Suzanne\nVega's doing it! Compilations like this are\nusually taken in one of two ways - a cynical\nattempt to cash in or a perfect way to\ndraw together those fans who like the\nartist but haven't had the time or\nmoney to collect every single sin\ng le. Market ploy or market\njoy? You decide!\nnot.\nNow for those jewels I mentioned. Dreaming oF me could have been made by any of a host of eighties\nbands but it's cool. Can't get enough is a classic which\ndeserves a mention despite being very close to an irritating classic. Everything counts captures the eighties'\ngreedy head in ess. Blasphemous rumours and Shake the\ndisease are great subtle tracks that show the direction\nDM headed into the future. Somebody is about the\nDepeche Mode, diamond geezers.\nonly slow song in the album and is thought provoking.\nThis collection is probably the best summary of DM's work between 1981-1985.1 don't think any other singles\nalbum would give you the range this does.\nAhmed\nT: Well,\nName: Suzanne Vega\nTitle: Tried And True - The Best Of\nRating: 52%\nH ow can you have a Best Of., collection of\nSuzanne Vega without Solitude Standing?\nCome on! Then, you have the 'disco' version\nof Fom's Diner, not the original! This album is supposed\nto contain the best and quintessential songs of this\nwoman. This means her own originals, not derivative,\nsouped-up versions! You can't help feeling the record\ncompany chose the wrong strategy for this album.\nThey decided to go for a selection of songs to complement those of the 1987 album - Solitude Standing,\nwhich is probably Vega's biggest-selling album. Granted,\nit isn't easy to select a certain set of songs from a repertoire of tracks covering her five albums and a few not-on-album singles. But they could've done better. On the\nplus side, two new songs are offered that ar quite good\n- Books, A Cover and Rosemary.\nThe album starts off well with Luka, messes up with\nthat 'DNA featuring Suzanne Vega' one, then goes on\nto Marlene on the Wall to repent for its sins. Caramel\nand 99.9Fare then served to appease but it is the lovely\nSmall Blue Thing - from her debut Suzanne Vega - that\ndoes it for me. Left of Center is also a real treat because\nit's great and you probably haven't heard it before. In\nLiverpool, Blood Makes Noise, and When Heroes Go\nDown ate featured from the 99.9F album. I am not sure\nI'd include these among her best songs. We get only\none song from her Days of Open Hand album - Book\noF Dreams, which is OK. I hadn't listened to anything\nfrom the 1996 Nine Objects oF Desire album, so the two\ngreat tracks taken off it pleased me a lot. All in all,\ndespite the presence of some great SV on this colle c tion, I can't get over the fact that Solitude Standing could\nhave been squeezed in. Also, that the original version\nof Tom's Diner should have been there. A bolder, not\nTried and True - read popular - selection was needed\nto make this collection hold together.\nAhmed\nhe\nOrb,\neh?\nthey've been\naround for awhile. In\nfact, they've been\naround long enough to\nstart growing whopping great\ntufts of white hair from various facial\norifices. They know this and they've looked\nat their watches. So what time is it kids? It's 'Greatest\nHits' time!\nUntil now, I had never been too sure about The\nOrb. Perhaps an over-hyped, electric eighties sound.\nMaybe just a happy, chart-friendly outfit. The jury has\nfinally returned a verdict. Let the double-barrelled\nassault on U.F. Off commence.\nThe Orb certainly never leave their home without\ntheir laptops and a power supply to fire electricity at\neverything they come across. Everything on this album\nis synthesised, digitised and disappointingly, sterilised.\nOne attribute summa rising the development of The Orb\nover the past decade is diversity. Obviously there are\nsimilarities flowing through every track, but this is just\nthe dub style that they embody. The diversity comes\nfrom the fact that the only reason The Orb have survived\nuntil now is that they simply mix, re-mix and re-mix some\nmore whatever is popular at the time. So, as the charts\nhave changed from UB40 through 2-Unlimited to The\nVerve, so have The Orb. Unfortunately the UB40 and\nName: The Orb\nTitle: U.F. Off-The Best of The Orb\nRating: 31%\nVerve sound was never meant to be 'dubbed' and so\nfalls flat on its face. Worst of all, they have even torn\napart Return to Innocence by Enigma, a modern day\nclassic in the music world.\nVarious attempts at ambience only achieve bore-dom, and the sheer inconsistency in sound just adds\nirritation - at least you can sleep to ambience. Finally I have realised why I was undecided about The Orb. I was\nlucky enough to have never encountered such a life-less, PC generated excuse for musical expression. Message to The Orb: Why don'tU. F. Off!\nDerek\nThe Orb, ambient wannabes.\n\n"

So this week I have left the page in the\nhands of my understudy - Roni, he's gonna hit you with\nsome hip hop, but do not fear I shall return and bring\nya the low down on R&B. And before I go, you all gotta go out and buy the\nFaith album today understand, this is the Bomb,\nthere is no subst it ue for class and this got fucking\nloads of it. Keep The Faith from Faith Evans....just buy\nit!\nMilen\nRoni's Raving\nYo, here it is... The lethal lyricists Ras Kass from the\nLeft Coast, and Canibus from the Fast dropped their\nalbums. Both suffered from the production not matching their lyrical carnage. While Canibus educated us on\nsongs such as Channel Zero, Ras Kass showed his versatility with a whole range of subjects, and although the\nbeats were better than his first album, it was patchy.\nCheck out some of his lyrics: 'You ain't got enough calcium to pick a bone with m cY Stay true to the game,\nbut the game ain't true to the emcee/When N***a's is\nbootleg g in' Makaveli 2 and 3.' Damn, that's tight! His\nalbum is better than Canibus', though Canibus is\nrumoured to be angry to the reception of his album.\nHe plans to release an EP over Xmas giving the people\nwhat they wanted. People likely to be on it are DJ Premier and Raekwon. Also, Wyclef may not be his manager anymore, but who knows in the world of rumours?\nOh yeah, LL Cool J shot his returning salvo at Clef in the\nform of Rasta Impasta, and believe me, this one really\ngets raw, and there is no news of this being released,\nprobably cos of not disappointing his fans. Ilmmm,\nguess I 'll have to play it on my radio show huh ? Speaking of the Fugees, Pras' Blue Angels should be out by\nnow sampling the theme from Grease (and Pras has\nnever seen the movie!) and his album should also be\nout. The true head z were sampling the delights of\nMos Def & Talib Kweli on their Black Star album on\nRawkus. These two got rhymes for days. Outkast\ndropped a third classic album, looks like they arc gonna\nbe replacing Tribe in Flip Hop's consciousness. Speaking of Tribe, they retired with a fifth album out, and a solid one at that, don't under-rate this. Heltah Skeltah\ndropped Magnum Force - I'm really feelin' \"I Ain't Havin That\" even if they jacked Tribe's Hot Sex beat. The\nbig Willie himself, Jay Z, drops his final album, with the\ntitle track Hard Knock Life proving to be one of the\ndo pest with the creative use of the hook from the musical Annie. Flipmode Squad released The Imperialwnich\nis a solid album, and if you like Busta you will lap this\nup. Cha Cha Cha is the single out right now but the real\nparty starter is Everybody On The Line Outside, while\nDuck Down's Buckshot shows up to recreate the old\nBlack Moon magic on We Got You Opin Part 2. Same\nbeat, same dope ness. Speaking of Black Moon, they are\nreforming but not under that name due to their acrimonious split from Nervous Records a few years ago.\nThe first single is around, called War Zone, and fellow\nBCC soldiers Cocoa Brovaz have a remix of Bucktown\nwith M.O.P. who dropped First Family 4 Life with some\nJohnBlaze shit on there, fat Joe came up with Don\nCartagena another solid album, straddling the line\nbetween hardcore and commercial. The West Coast\nwere rep ped by Xzibit producing a quality album that\nonly the real head z will appreciate, although t everyone\nwill love the party starter Pussy Pop with Method Man\n(a remix is coming out with Lil Kim!!!); the real jewel z are in the form of 3 Card Molly and Let It Rain though\nothers abound. The trend for 'old skool' bands reforming continues with the unification of DJ Alamo, Grand\nPuba, Sadat X and Lord Jamar as the original Brand\nNubian line-up. Their album, lou nd ation, is tight with\nthe single Foundation/The Return out now, DJ Premier\nproducing the latter. Gang Starr have been busy with\n1/2 & 1/2 on the Blade soundtrack with MOP, and also\nfound time for a few remixes off their album (of the\nyear!) in The Militia Part 2 with WCand Rakim! Also, the\nB side has a remix of The Militia by the chocolate boy\nwonder Pete Rock, who also has a solo single out featuring some heavy hitters, Tru Master. Dogg Pound\nmember Kurupt put out Kuruption! after relocating\nback home to Philly\nand taking years setting up and running his own label\nAntra. It's a double album, with one disc for each\ncoast, although it would've been better to just have one\ndisc with the best cuts. It ain't as good as it should've\nbeen and doesn't match up to Daz's album released\nbefore the summer. The Wu-Tang came up with The\nSwarm-a compilation with some good and bad tracks,\nand Sunz of Man finally dropped The Last Shall Be li rst, a solid effort. Watch out for albums coming out from\nthe Rza (aka Bobby Digital), Inspektah Deck and Method\nMan in the near future. The rest of the Wu-members\nand affiliates ain't far behind, with ODB, Ghostface and\nRaekwon slated for releases, and the all-woman crew\nof Deadly Venoms (check em on the compilation and\nthe Kurupt album) also comin'. La the Darkman's album\nshould be out by the time you're reading this. Death\nRow have been quiet lately, due to the falling through\nof their distribution deal with Breakaway Entertainment, so no Deaf/r Row: Inside Out for now. There is\na2 Pac Greatest Hits coming out on Interscope with\nsome new songs, and Nate Dogg released his double\nalbum G Funk Classics Vol 1 & 2 which featured a host\nof Death Row inmates including 'Pac, Dogg Pound,\nSnoop, etc. A class 12\" worth looking for is Queen Latifah's Name Callin' Part 2 where she blazes on all cy lin Triumph, Big's Kick In The Door, MOP'S How About\nSome Hardcore, LL's4,3,2,1 and finishes it with Busta's Put Your Hands... and with the line \"on your knees is\nthe only way you bitches gonna blow/so what you saying yo\" Ow! Don't know who she talking about, but she\ncontinues in a similar vein on the B side Get Off Minez,\nthis time on the DMX Get At Me Dog beat. Sadly, these\ndidn't appear on the album due to sample clearance\ncosts, and the album is a lot more R&B orientated, with\nonly a couple of rough hip hop tracks. The Beatnuts\nhave some crazy wild tracks on their new album coming soon, featuring I at Joe, Noreaga, Big Pun, Ghost\nFace Killah, and the usual bor i qua affiliates. Canibus has\nalso done a great track with AT.

    "content": "28 Arts 9 November 1998\nOUR COUNTRY'S GOOD ONE WOMAN (part 1)\nYoung Vic Theatre Battersea Arts Centre\nW hen a play this good is done\nthis well, reviewing becomes\nmore an art of self-restraint\nthan anything else. It would be easy to\nrave about so many things that it is hard\nto know where to start or more to the\npoint where to stop. Directing, staging,\nacting, humour, excitement and tension\nwere all performed with such smooth\nclarity and refinement that it allows the\nactors and audience to live and experience the play at a different level.\nAdapted by Timberlake Wertenbaker,\nthe play, set in 1 784, is about a group of\nconvicts, transported for various crimes\nto Australia, and the attempts of some of\nthe officers to reform them by allowing\nthem to put on a play of their own. Such\na situation allows the script to explore the\nrole of theatre in society, despite its\napparent lack of relevance with the modern era. Indeed it is this stark difference\nin circumstances that allows a fair, bleak\nand honest analysis of its true worth and\nbenefit.\nThe production challenges; it challenges the actors with all of them playing multiple characters of completely\ndifferent natures; it challenges the audience with perceptions of theatre; it challenges society with the way it deals with\noffenders, races and sex,- and it challenges the individual with their attitudes\nto hope, inspiration and desire.\nDuring the performance, the audience was rolling with laughter and silent\nin anticipation almost at the same time\n- the sharp insight almost mocking itself\nto the core and foundation it is written\non. Sometimes the comparisons are laid\ndown so transparently that it could easily leave the public cringing with embarrassment. However, the production\nsubtly avoids these pitfalls, by building\ncharacter relationships with the audi-en ce. The play has now gone on tour (and\ndare I say to what I'm sure will be for the\ncountry's good) but if you get the chance\nto see it, I would recommend it whole-hearted ly. It's enjoyable, fun and is best\nleft with some of its own words - \"A play\nshould make you understand something\nnew. If it tells you what you already\nknow, you leave it as ignorant as you\nwent in.\"\nMatt\nGRINLING GIBBONS AND THE\nART OF CARVING V&A Museum\nalready glimpsed his creations without\nrealising it. He's worked on Windsor Castle, Hampton Court Palace, St Paul's Cathedral, Trinity College Chapel in\nOxford, Wren Library in Cambridge... Gibbons received numerous commissions\n(for chimney pieces especially) from the\nnobility, including his acclaimed masterpiece the Cosimo panel (pictured in\ndetail) ordered by King Charles II. His typical repertoire is profoundly naturalistic-garlands of lush foliage, succulent fruit\nand blooming flowers, interspersed with\nthe occasional hunted pheasant. However, most interesting of all in my opinion was a model workbench, displaying\nthe types of chisels which Gibbons used\nto carve his lime wood reliefs. Once you\nhave observed the rudimentary tools at\nhis disposal, the sculptural dimensions\nand flowing lines, which Gibbons introduced into his Baroque composition,\nbecome all the more astonishing.\nW ith a name like Grinling Gibbons (1648-1721), you'll either\nbe famous or a complete\noddity - maybe even both. Although I haven'ta clue about his personal life, his\nexcellence as a craftsman has warranted\nthis retrospective, which coincides with\nthe 350th anniversary of his birth. As this\nexhibition proves. Gibbons is to woodcarving as Chippendale (in the sing u lar!) is to furniture,- they define a style\ngenerated and Inspired by their work.\nIt's certainly ironic that this greatest\nof British decorative sculptors was actually born in Rotterdam, where he was\napprenticed by Dutch masters. He only\nimmigrated to England in 1 667, shortly\nafter the devastating Fire of London\n(quite an astute career move, considering all the interiors in need of drastic\nredecorating).\nThe catalogue of projects to his\ncredit is impressive - you've probably\nHelena\nUntil 24th January\nO ver the next few weeks, the\nBAC is putting on a festival of\ntheatre and music, dedicated\nto women. A single woman performs\neach show and although the subjects\nvary enormously, they all have a common end theme - the place of women\nin society. Each artist draws on her own\nexperiences, highlighting her gift for\nsinging, acting or dancing.\nThis week, I went to see a couple of\nthese creations. The first one, Female\nParis was an adaptation of three short\nstories by Dario to and franca Rame,\ndanced and played by Heather Davics.\nShe begins by narrating the story of a little girl and her naughty dolly who swears\nall the time. She describes their adventures in some obscure fantasyland. The\ntone is comical but also quite frighten-ing; do all little girls live and dream like\nthis? Davies then proceeds to act out the\ntypical morning of a working mother; she\nhas to get the baby up and ready for the\nnursery without the help of her hus-band, who has an extra half hour in\nbed. It's a very touching account of the\nstruggle some women have to go\nthrough just to survive. Finally, she tells\nthe story of Medea, the Greek heroin,\nwho is devastated at the thought of parting from her children.\nthe second performance was called\nMother of the Pride. Eileen Page, a famous West End actress, performs the\nlast few hours of Eleanor d 'Acquitaine's life, a strong woman who ruled France\nand then became Queen of England,\neventually giving birth to Richard the\nLionheart. Page appears on stage, looks\ntowards the audience and starts talking\nto what she believes are the ghosts of\nher family. The whole play is fascinating\nas her life was an endless struggle. She\nhad to suffer through the infidelities of\nboth her husbands, the premature\ndeaths of her children and the harshness\nof life in medieval times. She comes\nacross as a very powerful character, stating several times that \"woman equals\nman\". She was definitively ahead of her\ntime in her beliefs.\nThere will be more about this festival in next week's issue, but do take a look because some of the performances\nare very exciting.\nD.

    "content": "8\nEditorial & Small Ads 9 November 1998\nOut of the Frying Pan...\nI have been trying to avoid this entire\nmedics' merger debate, as it seems to be\na minefield of opinion and prejudice,\nbut recent events (not least the seventy\nor so signatures attached to the letter in\nthis week's issue) have forced me to\nchange tack. So here goes...\nFirstly, I suspect that many of those\nwhose names appear on page six were\nnot entirely aware of the contents of the\nletter when they signed what is essentially a petition. May I suggest you take\nthe matter up with Mr Fmohare.\nAs for the rest of you, I have several\npoints to make. The initial article [Felix\n1120] explained that the figure could\nnot be confirmed. As for our source, I will not reveal who it was, suffice to say\nthat it was a( usually) reliable person.\nI agree that our factual information\nhas been incorrect - hence the article in\nlast week's Felix pointing out our mis-takes, and correcting them where pos-sib le. Again, I am not in the habit of\ntaking heresy as fact - our 'source' for that\narticle is usually reliable, and I was as irritated as everyone else when I found\nout the truth.\nAs for Nick Carter's statement, I printed the only message I got from him\non the letters page. As the matter is still\nunder investigation, I think it would be\nfoolish to speculate on the eventual out-come.\nThe article on the doctor who\nreceived compensation was not printed\nbecause she \"just happened to have\nworked at Charing Cross\", it was printed\nbecause it was in national headlines at\nthe time and therefore of interest to\nImperial students.\nAs for last week's \"racist\" article, I would point out that Imperial Medical\nSchools are not mentioned until halfway\ndown the second paragraph, and only\nthen in a list compromising several other\nuniversities. I cannot be held responsible if you choose to read 'ICSM' for 'Med-ical Schools'. I would also point out that\nthe article concerned a public report of\nundeniable importance, not a private\nFelix investigation, and is being taken\nseriously by those institutions mentioned\nwithin its pages. Whether or not it is true\nis open to debate and investigation, but\nto deny outright a report commissioned\nby the Medical Schools' own Council is\nhardly a mature attitude. These are serious allegations and deserve to be treated\nas such by anyone interested in a fair and\nnon-discriminatory admissions pro ce dure. While I am confident the college\ndoes its best to ensure such a procedure,\nthe McManus Report must surely be\ncause for alarm.\nFinally I do not hold medics in con-tempt. As for the rest of the Felix staff,\nI obviously do not know their personal\nopinions, but I ask them to be impartial\nwhen reporting for the newspaper. I also\nfind it tasteless that you think readers are\n\"amused at the expense of medics\" by\narticles concerning missing finances and\nallegations of racism. Personally, I am\nnot amused.\n...And Away from the Fire\nAll that said, I do agree that some factual\ninformation has been inaccurate, and\nevery effort is made to correct such mistakes when they occur. I also agree with\nyour comments regarding Messrs Carter\nand Heeps. When mistakes are made,\nhowever, we will report them, irrespective of what person or institution is\nresponsible.\nAs a large number of medics voted\nfor me, I feel an obligation to try to do\nmore than previous Felix editors when it\ncomes to listening to medics' views. We\ncurrently have two medics writing\ncolumns, and I would be very happy to\nsee more involved in Felix.\nAt the end of the day there is prejudice on both sides of the divide, but\nthankfully it is confined to a small number of narrow minded individuals like\n'The Censors' on this week's letters page.\nI print such letters in the hope that sensible IC students (i.e. most of us) may\nrecognise the person or persons responsible, and avoid them in the future.\nWe are now all one institution, like\nit or not, and we've got to live with that.\nPersonally I think it's a great opportunity\nfor all IC students. I 've seen first year\nmedics at South Ken Ents nights, and\ntheir presence is very welcome (and, no,\nnot just because they tend to even up\nthe sex ratio). I think non-medical students do need to remember one thing,\nhowever. It's all very well to expect medical students to have friends from all\ndepartments at Imperial. We (South Ken\nresidents) leave after three or four years\n- medics are here for twice that. If they\ndon't have more medic friends than non-medics, they could end isolated for their\nlast few years. It's all a question of getting the balance right - and from what\nI 've heard and seen, most first years\nseem to be coping just fine while older\nstudents on both sides keep the prejudice going.

It was unique in\nthat it provided as cries of rooms\ndesigned specifically for the exposition of\nartwork. Today, the gallery is part of the\nCourthauld Institiute of Art and houses a combination ol\npermanent and\nshort-term exhibits.\nThe building itself\nis an attraction,\nwith elegantly\ncrafted ceilings\nand spiralling\nstone staircases,\nbut it is the inherent simplicity that\nlends itself to the\ndisplay of pieces.\nThe founder\nof the Institute,\nSamuel Courtauld,\nwas also a major\nbenefactor of this \u2022 ~\"\ncollection. Consequently, the most\nfamous Impressionist and Post-impressionist artists jostle for recognition on the\ntop floor. However, the exhibition also\nreaches back as far as the 14th century.\nAs you ascend, you are transported\nthrough the ages, culminating in what is,\nin my opinion, the highlight of the\ngallery's offerings: Room 12. Temporary\nexhibitions.\nThe current occupant of this space is\nMaterial Evidence. This innovative presentation aims to provoke an increased\nappreciation of the displayed pieces, by\nexploring the different media available to\nthe artists. It emphasises the difficulties\nposed by these\ntools and presents\nthe response from\nvarious \"masters\"\nsuch as Rembrandt, Constable,\nVan Gogh and\nCezanne.\nThe most\nremarkable aspect\nof this study is its\nencouragement of\nvisitor participation.\nInspired by the\natmosphere of\nconcentrated tal-ent, you can sit and\n:\nexperiment with\nthe materials which were used to create\nthe famous works. Quills and ink, char-coal, graphite and chalks are al! pro-vi ded, as is information about their\norigins. Accompanying extracts from educational journals, dating from the 17th to\nthe 19th centuries, then desc ti bc the\naccepted techniques and approaches of\nthe time. In this way, the Courthauld\nachieves its purpose; it didn't take me\ni ong to realise how much skill was\nneeded to temper these tools. An example is the work by Guercino entitled\nMother and Child (pictured right). By\ncontrasting a smudged red chalk outline with hard, strong sketching, he\nexpresses the soft\nskin of a baby against :\nthe rough fibres of\nits mother's skirt.\nAnother point 1\nwhich is stressed, is |\nthe diversity which\ncan be attained from :\n;\nthe same starting |\npoint. None of the I displayed pieces j appeared to be the I same due to the oil 1\nfe ring styles of the j artists. Thctc is a final |\nsection in the ex hi bi ion enlil led I\\iie ii ment s\". This has\nbeen included to make sure that we\nbear in mind the fact that artists should\nnever be restricted by their materials.\nOften great and famous pieces have\nbeen produced when the artist defied\nthe approved standard. In A Road\nThrough a Wood, Thomas Gainsborough\ncombines the dusky colours of iron oxide\nchalk with the substance generated by oil\npaint; as a result, the painting comes to\nlife. At the time, red chalk was generally\nused for fine detail and oil paint applied\nquite thinly, but by turning these concepts around, an amazing vibrancy could\nbe achieved.\nThe desire to challenge seems to\n; be a common\ntheme for the Courtauld and future\n..'

It has been restored\nto accommodate the large collection of\nItalian modern art owned by Eric and\nSalome Estorick, now deceased. As well\nas the permanent exhibits on display, the\nModern Art Gallery in Rome has recently\nloaned twenty works by the most prominent Futurists.\nThis exhibition charters the movement from It origins just before the First\nWorld War to the end of the 1930s. It\nbegins with the fascinating paintings by\nGiacomo Balla dating from 1910-1915; he\napplies the ideas that Marinetti\nen ounce d in his futurist manifesto.\nSpeed, technology, noise and mechanics - terms that define the Futurists' desire\nto promote the technological progress of\nthe 20th century. In his pieces (Mercury\nPassing the Sun, Observed Through the\nTelescope, pictured centre) Balla is visibly influenced by work created at the\ntime: the Cubists (and later the Surrealists), Klee, Leger... Colours\noften represent particular ideas or moods. In\nPessimism and Optimism\nfor instance, he portrays\nnegative vibes in black\nand positive ones in blue.\nOther interesting paintings include Fillla's Mechanical Idol, in which\nthe technical world is represented as a replacement for God and\nreligion. The second\ngallery then concentrates on the later\noutput of futurism, from the end of the\n1920s until the Second World War. The\ninnovative technique of \"Aeropainting\" is\nillustrated here with a beautiful work by\nDespero entitled Lunar Prisms (pictured\nleft), as well as a painting by Marinetti's wife, Benedetta. futurism certainly\nevolved over the years and trough out the\ngenerations, but still remained faithful to\nits original concepts.\nThe rest of the gallery is devoted to\nquite an extensive display of Italian modern art in general. The exhibits include by\nMusicby fu i gi Russolo, a festival of bright\ncolours and imagination,\nand works by Gino Severini, another very influential Iut uris t.I was also\npleasantly surprised to\nfind Chitico in the col-lect ion, as his distinctive\nstyle inspired Dali and\nMagritte amongst o th ers.\nFurther on, the collection focuses more on\nsculptures by Marino\nMarini and Emilio Greco\n(nothing very interesting though), finally,\nthe last room displays lots of drawings,\nsome early Boccioni, a few sketches by\nModigliani {Tete et Buste de Profit avec\nBoucle d 'Oreille, pictured rig hO and several very funny political cartoons. A lot of\nthese tend to resemble Picasso or\nMatisse, too much in fact to be taken seri-ou sly. Overall, this collection has a lovely\nfeel to it and I can imagine going there\nseveral times to have a look at a particular work I liked. It is also a nicely timed\nexhibition, proving that the Futurists had\na point and defended their art strongly\ndespite all the bad reactions they\nreceived at the time. Futurist fans like me\nwill relish seeing paintings previously\nunknown. The modernity and magic of\nit will enchant others not quite so familiar with this movement.\nD.

And where could\nI find these obviously rare journals? UCf.\nThis severely questions Imperial College's commitment to having a world-class\nmedical school. Further questioning and\nprobing brought to light the fact that\nthe stocking of the medical section of the\nCentral Library had been hindered for\neighteen months by a bureaucratic battle between the College Librarian and\nSchool of Medicine staff.

But this comic... I mean this\n'Outcast Ben' Comic was really dirty, but\nat least, if not anything else, it had an\nironic touch or sort of.

I am particulate^ appalled at the derogatory words\nand images used to describe women in\nthat feature. Are you aware that the college has anti-discrimination regulations\nand that these cover written distributed\nmaterial. I find the use of the word c*\" as offensive when describing women as\nthe word n***\" would be to a black stu-dent. Racially offensive material is quite\nrightly intolerable in this university so\nplease explain to me why sexually\nderogatory material is not treated in the\nsame way!\nFemale students are a minority at IC\nand their rights and feelings should be\nconsidered in areas that they are involved\nin -this includes IC union and as a result,\nthis paper.

As for the point that 1 should-n't publish material \"just to get a response\", provoking debate and discussion Is one of the alms of these pages\n(in this case what is the line between\nentertainment and discrimination).\nGiven the number of people at IC who\nread Viz, the comic strips could be said\nto fall within the 'entertain the reader-ship' criteria.
