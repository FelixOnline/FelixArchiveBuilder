    "content": "Borgen: not exactly Sherlock...\nThis week on Twitter\nSome top tweets about Sherlock\n@Sherlockology\nAstonishingly high AI of 91 for\n#Sherlock - The Reichenbach\nFall. Bonkers frankly, you just\ndon\u2019t see those kind of numbers often!\nF\nirst of all, it\u2019s worth saying that I enjoyed Sherlock and, overall, thought it\nwas a good watch. In fact, I think that\nthe first series was excellent, except\nfor one major problem which I\u2019ll get\nto later. However, in the second series, there are\nsome things that bugged me about it. I thought I\u2019d\nfocus on those as you\u2019re also getting another view\nfocussing on the best bits (we spoil you).\nJostling for position at the top of my list of complaints is the start of the second series. Seriously,\nit looked as if the writers wrote the cliffhanger for\nthe first series finale, then just said \u201chow will he\nget out of this using his cunning, fuck it we\u2019ll decide later\u201d. Sherlock escapes by Moriarty basically just going: \u201cmeh, fuck it, I\u2019m off now. It\u2019s stuffy\nand smells of chlorine in here\u201d. Then it \u2018all tied\nin\u2019at the end of the episode. It was lazy, and even\nwith suspended disbelief set to maximum; it was\nas weak as a drop of Robinson\u2019s in the Pacific.\nNow on to another main problem: the charac-ters. Sherlock, himself, was not all too bad. He\nwas similar enough to be recognisable as the\ncharacter. At times, he was a bit of moody prick,\nwhen in the books he is blunt but charming. With\nwomen, he is a gentleman, but just shows no sexual interest in them. The show does pretty much\ncapture the essence of him well, and who doesn\u2019t\nlove Benny C.\nThe major problem, mentioned above, was Jim\nMoriarty. He was terrible, I\u2019m sorry, but he was\nthat\u2019s a fact. Well, obviously it\u2019s not a fact as it\u2019s\nmy opinion, but shhhh. Moriarty in absolutely no\nway resembled the figure of Professor Moriarty\nin the novels, except for being Sherlock\u2019s enemy\nand the bad guy. In the books, he is an elderly,\nsoftly spoken man, who is well respected by society and who couldn\u2019t have a bad word said about\nin the press, as people would think it was libel.\nYou could say that, as it\u2019s a show, it can take ar-The Hound of the Baskervilles could have been\nso good. Why did they come up will all the\nbullshit stuff? How could you not reread\nit and decide that it\u2019s actually not an\nimprovement on the original.\nIn summary, Sherlock is good\nand an enjoyable watch. The\nfirst series was excellent,\nthe second not as good but\nstill fun and worth checking out; I just like to moan,\nand besides, it\u2019s my personal\nopinion. In fact, that\u2019s the\nwonderful thing about all art\nforms. They are all personal\nto you, in this case more so\nthan many others. My version of Sherlock Holmes\nis a certain way, and my\nimage of him in my head\nis Jeremy Brett (from\nthe old BBC drama-tization). If Sherlock\nis your introduction\nto the sleuth, you\nmay find the books\nweird and feel like\nthey are wrong, as\nthings aren\u2019t how\nyou picture them.\nSo it\u2019s all about\npoint of view,\nand how much\nspare time\nyou manage\nto make for\nyourself to\nwrite an\na r t i c l e\nlike this.\nAn epic Sherlock special...\n@ItsJimMoriarty\n#WhenLifeGivesYouLemons,\nyou won\u2019t be able to learn\nabout lemons on Wikipedia\nanymore. #WikipediaBlackout\n#Sherlock\n@digitalspy\nBenedict Cumberbatch\nvoted greatest ever on-screen\n#Sherlock Holmes\nI\u2019m afraid that I missed out on the phenomenon\nthat was The Killing so I was eager to watch the\nBBC\u2019s newest Danish import Borgen. Produced\nby the same broadcaster as The Killing, Borgen\nis a political drama about Birgitte Nyborg whose\nsmall Moderate party\u2019s massive election gains,\nfollowing damaging revelations about her rivals,\nhas made her Denmark\u2019s first female Prime Minister.\nAs could be expected the show has two strands\n\u2013 the political drama and the personal lives of\nBirgitte and those around her. The political element is certainly entertaining but also completely\nunrealistic and over the top. Every major political\ndevelopment seems to happen during live television interviews and debates \u2013 in the very first episode Birgitte immediately cuts the Moderate\u2019s ties\nformer allies Labour after an interviewer suggests\nthat the latter has changed their policies. Admittedly the show recognises that this wasn\u2019t exactly\nthe cleverest thing for her to do \u2013 we get to see a\ntistic licence. I just think they took too much. The\ncore of the character, and his personality, was so\nfundamentally changed that they basically shared\na name and that\u2019s all. In the show, he was a cut and\npaste of The Master from Doctor Who. He wasn\u2019t\nscary and sinister at all. He was way too openly\ncrazy for you to find him intimidating, basically\nlike an angry chav. The shouting down the phone\nof skinning people sounded like a bad impression\nofAri Gold from Entourage.\nSo we move on down my hit list of whinging,\nwhich, I can assure you, has left the Felix office\na cold, dark place as nobody agrees with me (I\nhave been ostracised). The next target is Irene\nAdler. I won\u2019t get into a feminism debate here.\nI have noticed that Steven Moffat is not good at\nwriting strong, sexy women. To be fair, I can\u2019t\neither, and that\u2019s probably because neither of us\nare strong, sexy women. They usually end up\nturning out cringey and sounding like Jay from\nthe Inbetweeners (\u201cwhat me? Yeah I fuck people\nALL THE TIME\u201d). Another example is River\nSong from Doctor Who. In fact, that whole episode was a bit dumb really. Why fundamentally\nchange the plot so much when the original plot\nwas so good, and easily modernisable. Plus, while\nI\u2019m at it, why did her phone suddenly have text to\nunlock it when she showed it to Sherlock, when\nbefore it was a password and why, if they were so\nanxious to get rid of the photos, did they need the\npasscode? Why not just blow the phone up/melt\nit down? Also, why change Irene Adler from \u2018the\nwomen who beat him\u2019, to \u2018the woman who, with\na lot of help, sort of won, but actually in the end\ndidn\u2019t\u2019. The run time of that episode didn\u2019t really\nhelp it out: it felt a big dragged out at times.\nWhat is the point in having a great set of characters and stories to use if you\u2019re just going to\nend up throwing half of them away in a mon-tage, and the other half alter beyond recognition.\nrather amusing shot of her exasperated spin doctor standing behind the cameras \u2013 but something\nlike this happens almost every episode. Not that\nthis does the Moderates any harm \u2013 despite the\nelection results they are still not the largest party\nbut Birigitte\u2019s political manoeuvring gets her the\ntop job.\nThis doesn\u2019t get any better once Birigitte does\nget into power. While she often has to use clever\npolitical tricks to get her way there is no sense\nof any deeper exploration of the nature of power\nor of politics. Almost all of the Birigitte\u2019s problems have clear, black and white solutions. This\nreached its ridiculous height in the latest episode\nbroadcast here in the UK, \u2018100 Days\u2019, in which\nshe has to decide whether to grant yet more autonomy to Greendland \u2013 despite its corrupt gov-ernment, failing schools system and alarming suicide rate. It doesn\u2019t take her long to decide that the\nnational pride coming from more autonomy will\nsomehow help the Greendlanders solve all their\nproblems.\nThe personal elements are handled somewhat\nMaciej Matuszewski\nButchers in Northern England named this tasty\nsausage after everyone\u2019s favourite posh bloke\nBenedict Cumberland\n@BBCRadio4\n#Sherlock\u2019s Benedict Cumberbatch stars in Tom and Viv,\nour drama about TS Eliot\u2019s\nmarriage to Viv Haigh-Wood\nbbc.in/wt5yFn\nTELEVISION\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n22\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTelevision Editors: George Barnett\nJames Simpson\nTim Arbabzadah goes all Sherlock Holmes on the scriptwriting\nb e t t e r.\nThere is no melodrama for i t s\nown sake and every character is well developed\nand acts like a real person.

    "content": "In the age of privilege, when very few attended\nand graduated from university, achieving the\ndegree of Doctor was a rare feat even amongst\nthe educated. Doctors were revered in many\nof the royal courts of Europe and granted\nprivileges reserved only to the highest peers of\nthe realm: in Spain, France, the Holy Roman\nEmpire and Portugal, doctors were exempt\nfrom uncovering their heads in the presence\nof the sovereign, and were allowed to address\nHim without previous questioning. Even the\nawarding of such PhDs was performed differently \u2013 these were not, for instance, awarded\nafter a dissertation had been submitted, but\ninstead granted to honour the academic career\nof the holder who, for one reason or another,\nhad been deemed sufficiently distinguished as\nto deserve a doctoral degree. PhDs were thus\nintimately linked to academia \u2013 to the point\nthat they were seldom awarded out of it \u2013 and\ndoctors inevitably pursued academic careers\nbecause it was the only way of being awarded\nsuch degrees in the first place.\nIn the first half of the 19th century German\nuniversities redefined doctoral degrees to their\npresent form: degrees granted after a period of\nthorough research leading to an original scientific contribution. American universities soon\nembraced this model and, begrudgingly, European universities such as Oxford and Cambridge ended up applying it too. However, the\nview of PhDs as academic-leading degrees\nstill holds on in society.\nConsidering the high specialisation required\nof PhD candidates, both at the point of appli-cation, as well as in what is delivered \u2013 the\nprogramme content, this view is hardly sur-prising.\nOn average it takes at least 3 intense years to\ncomplete a PhD, and combined with the three\nto four years spent obtaining requisite Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees, makes doctorates\npalatable only for those with a strong bent towards a career in research. While the private\nnon-academic sector does conduct significant\namounts of research, this often does not include research deemed as risky, audacious\nor too vague, so that even in the USA most\nresearch is publicly funded and, excluding research laboratories, carried out in or around\nuniversities.\nAnd then PhD programmes themselves\nare often shaped in such a way that doctoral\nstudents are trained for nothing but research\nand academia; skills such as team working,\nmanagement, business, accountancy and law\nare often completely neglected in the pursuit\nof pure knowledge. It is no surprise that after\nsuch an upbringing most PhD candidates show\na preference for academic careers when asked\nabout their future employment preferences.\nBesides, the huge spread of university graduates in the last few decades has led to a steep\nincrease in the amounts of doctors, drawing\nthe editors of Nature to declare \u201cPhDs now\ngrow like mushrooms\u201d. As they pointed out\nsome months ago, the number of doctorates\nearned each year has grown by 40% in the\nOECD countries during the last decade, and\nwith a limited number of academic positions\navailable, many such PhD graduates will never get jobs to match their qualifications; supply\nhas outstripped demand.\nThis has two main consequences. For one,\nit makes the entry to an academic career a\ntighter competition. PhD holders are forced\nto gain better qualifications and improve their\nacademic CVs, often by taking successive\npoorly paid postdoctoral positions. In many\ndisciplines, having completed a few years of\npostdoc work is already an a priori requirement for an academic position, and in some\nextreme cases such as life sciences, people\nmay well need to spend between five and ten\nyears doing postdoctoral work before even being able to apply for a tenured position, which\neven then, is not guaranteed to be successful.\nRecent data published by the Royal Society\nshows that of all PhD holders, 47% opt for\nwhat they euphemistically call \u201cearly career\nresearch\u201d, i.e. postdocs. Statistics show that\nonly 3.5% of PhD holders will ever manage\nto become permanent research staff \u2013 academics \u2013 however, and even fewer (about 0.45%)\nwill become university professors. With about\n17% of PhD holders undertaking non-academ-ic research careers, the overwhelming majority of PhDs end up in careers outside research.\nThis majority was recently reviewed in the\nNew York Times. In an article titled \u201cIs a MasAbout turns on the road to\nacademia\nCareer routes following the completion of a PhD, as published in the 2010 Royal\nSociety report The Scientific Century: securing our future prosperity\nter\u2019s the new Bachelor\u2019s?\u201d the NYT analysed\nthe difficulties many Bachelor\u2019s degree holders face when looking for graduate job positions owing to the ever increasing number of\nbetter qualified (Master\u2019s, in this case) degree\nholders. These Master\u2019s holders, in turn, struggle for job positions that were traditionally\nheld for them, due to the widespread proliferation of the even more highly qualified doctors.\nHence, the second consequence: the proliferation of academic degrees seems to have diluted the value of each qualification, and is thus\nchanging the requirements on careers outside\nacademia too.\nWhile the situation is an unhappy one for\nBachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree holders, PhDs\nworking outside academia often see themselves in positions for which they are overly\nqualified and underpaid. As was pointed out in\nNature, PhDs themselves are not linked to significant gains in terms of salary \u2013 being only\nabout 1-3.5% higher than that of Master\u2019s\nholders \u2013 nor in higher job satisfaction. The\nbiggest beneficiaries of this situation are the\nprivate companies, able to hire more highly\nqualified candidates for less.\nOver time, voices claiming for another redefinition of doctoral degrees are becoming\nlouder. Arguing that the proliferation of PhDs\nis leading to the above described dilution of\nthe degree, it has been proposed that PhDs\nshould be re-shaped to better match the needs\nof the job market, and less so those of aca-demia. Current EPSRC-sponsored EngD and\nCentres for Doctoral Training seem to be leaning in that direction, but question is whether a\nmere reform of PhD programs is all PhD degrees need in the modern world.\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n10\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nBUSINESS\nWith Nature citing the number of PhDs as \u201cgrowing like mushrooms\u201d, is the\ndoctorate in need of reform?\nLetter from the Editors\nIn 2009 an advisory group chaired by Sir Martin\nTaylor FRS and comprising of two Nobel Laureates,\ntwo ex Science Ministers and two leaders in industry met as an advisory group to detail recommendations for government policy and the future of\nscience in the UK. Their report \u2013 The Scientific Century \u2013 makes the case for continued investment in\nscience during an austere age.\nPublished in the face of impending public spending cuts, the report warned of the need for urgent\naction to maintain the UK\u2019s position of competitive\nadvantage in the sciences and technology. Their\nadvice, summarised in six recommendations for\ngovernment strategy, made the case for science\nand innovation led economic growth and explained\nhow the fragile infrastructure that links these two\nideas would be undermined by the \u201cfalse economy\u201d\nof cuts to the sector.\nAs well as the need to encourage industry and\nprivate research institutions through such a fiscal\ndisplay of confidence, they also urged strong and\nconfidence-boosting measures towards individuals.\nThey recognised a need to encourage established\nscientists and early career researchers with funding incentives and greater numbers of postdoctoral\nfellowships, support schemes and improved visa\nconditions to enable overseas collaboration, as\nthey put it, to \u201cprioritise investment in excellent\npeople.\u201d\nThe need for investment in people was traced\nfrom primary education right through to postgraduate education, and the current state of PhD train-ing. A change in the adcademic landscape, whereby interdepartmental and intervaristy collaboration\nare encouraged, would improve the ability to progress pure science to innovation, but requires researchers with broader expertise than is offered by\ncurrent PhD programmes. In order for postgraduate\ndegrees to remain a bastion of intellectual achieve-ment, respected both inside and outside careers\nin science, their content must change in some way\nto reflect both scientific and non-scientific spheres.\nAs such, the \u2018soft skills\u2019 of teamwork, communi-cation, and negotiation, often seen as peripheral\nto the academic agenda, must play and more fundamental role if higher education in the UK is to\nsurvive and prosper.\n\u2013The Business Editors\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\n\n"

    "content": "Camping in an Old Street basement\nAs acronyms go, the one belonging to the\nCity Arts & Music Project is a bit awkward.\nThe same goes for the name of its nightclub:\nCAMP Basement.\nA small club just off Old Street roundabout\nand unlike a lot of its neighbouring estab-lishments, there\u2019s nothing pretentious about\nthis place; in fact the whole feel of it can be\nsummed up within the first two metres of\nwalking off the pavement. The guy taking\nticket money sits, with his tiny cash box, at\na table which is uncomfortably reminiscent of\nthose wobbly pieces of shit we all know and\nlove from the Great Hall at exam time.\nDownstairs, an abundance of MDF separates\nthe cupboard-like toilets and fire escape from\nthe rest of the room. The tiled floor reminds one\nof a 19th century hospital. But people who go\nto clubs for nice decor are dickheads anyway.\nWe walked in at about midnight to the monophonic fuzz of Mr Oizo\u2019s \u2018Flat Beat\u2019, and the\nwarm-up DJ continued by putting a firm pair\nof V\u2019s up at DJ etiquette, playing some of the\nbiggest tunes in UK bass music from the past\ncouple of years. Then, as Lokiboi stepped up at\nabout half past, releases from the likes of Julio\nBashmore, Mosca, Burial and Joy O flowed\nYou wouldn\u2019t get this at most club nights,\nbut here were a bunch of young lads playing their favourite music and just having fun,\nsomething which too often gets forgotten in\nthe competition for unreleased tracks and kudos for finding music no one\u2019s heard before.\nASBO, the MC for the night, kept things\nlively and although I often have reservations\nabout MCs, ASBO played it well, serving as a\nconnection between the DJ and the dance floor\nwithout basking in self-importance.\nHowever, the young group\u2019s inexperience at\nhosting nights showed when RAMP label owner Tom Kerridge stepped up with a crate full\nof vinyl, something the laptop DJs hadn\u2019t seen\ncoming and for some reason caused significant\nconfusion. It took about fifteen minutes before\nthe correct cables were in the correct places and\nTom could get things moving again.\nHe restarted the proceedings with the incredible \u201854-46 That\u2019s My Number\u2019 by Toots\nand the Maytals, the opening track to the film\nThis is England; the irony of which I\u2019m sure\nwasn\u2019t missed by the tall, well-built skin-head.\nEventually, he setlled down into more traditional booming house music.\nUnfortunately for me, the set lacked variety\nand I eventually grew bored. Sometime after\n3, Arkist took Tom Kerridge\u2019s place behind\nthe decks, rolling out the disco house which\nenlivened the dance floor once again until we\ndecided the lure of fried chicken was too much\nand headed for the exit.\nCAMP Basement is a strange place, I\u2019ve\nnever seen it particularly busy; almost to the\npoint of being too empty, yet I find myself\nreally growing to like it. It\u2019s not trying to be\nanything other than a place for like-minded\nheads to go and enjoy some of the best music coming out of the UK underground dance\nmusic scene, and for that you\u2019ve really got to\nrespect it.\nWalk Off the Earth\nTheo Pavlakou on the\nenlightening covers of the\nlastest viral outfit\nW\ne\u2019ve all heard Walk Off the Earth\u2019s\ncover of \u2018Somebody That I Used to\nKnow\u2019 by Gotye, and if you haven\u2019t\nthen you should get on it, because\nthese guys are actually good. Actually,\nthey\u2019re better than good. They\u2019re talented. And they use\ntheir talent creatively.\nAlot of stuff goes on YouTube that really does suck (search\nfor any two random words, and you will find a home video\nthat was not worth the effort of uploading to the web), but\nthat\u2019s great, because after a long day in uni, toilet television\nmight just be what we need to totally numb our brain. But\nthese guys really were worth going viral and I\u2019m happy for\nthem. I mean, come on, they\u2019re catchy, and not just the Gotye\ncover, but all of their covers. (and when I say catchy, I\u2019m not\ntalking about that frustrating catchy where you end up with\nNicole Scherzinger singing in your head... \u201cWhy? WHY?!\u201d)\nThey put a creative twist on what they cover, from Rihanna to Adele, and have really done what a lot of artists try\nto do but don\u2019t quite pull off. The thing that they get right\nis that they don\u2019t try and copy the song, they add their own\ninnovative flavour to it, and I don\u2019t mean that they just play\nit acoustically either. They change it. They take what people\nknow and love, and they reform it, and that\u2019s what makes\ntheir music so good.\nBut lets take a look at where these guys were before they\nhit 23,000,000+ (as seen on 16th January). So according to\nWikipedia, which I\u2019ll use as a reference for an article that\nyou\u2019ll probably read on the tube, the toilet, or not at all; their\nfirst success was when they covered \u2018Backin\u2019 Up\u2019 by the\nGregory Brothers, uploaded on the 13th Dec 2010, which\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I didn\u2019t know before these guys covered\nthem (Does that make me uncool? Should I have? I don\u2019t\nknow). That didn\u2019t hit far higher than 1mil, which I\u2019m assuming about half came after their current hit anyway, but\neven so they did well. But, these guys started out in 2006!\nWhere were they for like 5 years?

    "content": "ally harmful to the idea of democracy,\nsince they tend to create a large group\nof frustrated, disinterested non-voters.\nOn the other hand, the system of capitalism is fundamentally based on com-petition. Thus, it will naturally drive\nsociety towards a state of inequality\nrather than equality. The accumulation\nof wealth by one individual can only\noccur at the cost of other individuals.\nGranted, there do exist a few overlaps\nbetween the basic principles of democracy and capitalism. For example,\ncapitalism does need a developed judiciary in order to operate. This can\nbe observed in China, where Western\ncompanies are often struggling since\ntheir intellectual properties are not rigorously protected by the state. On the\nother hand, it has to be pointed out that\ncapitalism outdates western democra-cies, and was working perfectly well in\nthe old monarchies of pre World War I\nGermany and Austro-Hungary.\nBUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 11\nBrand Identity\nThe Imperial Entrepreneurs explain the impact of branding\nAlexandru Podgurschi\nBloomberg BusinessWeek recently\npublished an article by Larry Popelka\ntitled \u201cThe Key to Success? Your Corporate Mission.\u201d It investigates the\nparticular case of the Chevrolet Volt\nand it is perfectly summed up by one\nline: \u201cMost consumers no longer shop\nfor products. They shop for a company.\u201d\nWhat makes people crave that Ralph\nLauren Polo rather than the Tommy\nHilfiger shirt, the new iPad/iPhone over\nany Android device, that bottle of Mo\u00ebt\n& Chandon rather than Veuve Clicquot\nor the Toyota Prius over a Chevrolet\nVolt? There are definitely enough arguments to rationalise the desire, but\nwhether one admits it or not, an established brand makes it that much easier\nfor a company to sell their product.\nThat is not to say that establishing\na brand in itself is an easy task. There\nis a reason why most major companies have a Marketing department. It\nreaches well beyond the (often) cheesy\nads on television and on billboards.\nThe job these people have at hand is\nto create a brand identity, an image the\ntargeted customer can identify with, an\nillusion that their customers are somehow part of a distinguished community\nthat purchases those products.\nThe number of times you see someone check their phone because they\nhave heard someone else\u2019s iPhone\nmessage alert is ever increasing, yet\nthese iPhone owners still feel special,\nlike they are somehow different. And\nthat is precisely what consumer goods\ncompanies try to achieve. So how do\nthey go about creating that identity?\nThe simple answer is by making themselves stand out from the immense\nnumber of other companies out there.\nBut that\u2019s a bit general and not all that\nuseful.\nFirst off, the name is one the most\nimportant aspects of creating a brand.\nJoining together the four last names of\nthe founders might be a good idea for\na law or financial services company,\nbut unless your last names have a particularly catchy sound to it, this is to be\navoided. The last thing a start-up needs\nis for people to not be able to refer to\nit simply because they are unsure about\nhow to pronounce its name.\nSecondly, the logo. The simpler it\nis, the better it is. Trouble is that the\nshorter and more basic the design brief,\nthe harder it is to actually design one.\nWhile it can certainly change along the\nway, as many companies such as Starbucks, Mazda or Apple have (if you\nhaven\u2019t yet, please do check out Apple\u2019s original logo), the logo should instantly scream the name of your brand.\nA Google search for \u201clogo design\u201d\nshould offer more than enough options\nto suit anyone\u2019s needs for any time and\nprice range.\nAs a final piece of advice, the importance of a good website cannot be\nunderestimated. Anyone can get a de-cent-looking one up and running with\na basic template. If your Computing\nfriends at Imperial refuse to help, there\nare plenty of people out there willing\nto do the job for a relatively small fee.\nIt is one of the most common, yet easiest to avoid, aspects of a business that\ncan turn people away. A perfunctory\nwebsite suggests a shady company, and\nwe\u2019ve all avoided buying things off\ncertain websites simply because they\ndon\u2019t inspire much confidence.\nCreating a brand is no easy task. And\nit certainly isn\u2019t limited to the few aspects outlined above. Some might even\nclaim maintaining one is even harder.\nTo the entrepreneurs out there, it is often one of the most challenging aspects\nof starting a business. It is sometimes\nsaid that it is not the idea, but rather\nits implementation that makes a busi-ness, and a good realisation of an idea\nwill avoid becoming obsolete only if it\nis well promoted. It is a combination\nof management, marketing, accounting\nand innovation that makes a business\nthrive; establishing a brand is surely\nthe aspect that is most easily overlooked and yet essential for a successful venture.\nTwo of the most recognisable brands in the world, Coca-Cola and PepsiCola, have been warring over the soft drinks market for more than three\ndecades\nDemocracy and capitalism: an unhappy marriage?\nWhen Lehman Brothers filed for\nbankruptcy on 15 September 2008, it\nmarked the most dramatic collapse of\nan U.S. firm in history. In many ways,\nthe name of the once fourth biggest investment bank in the United States has\nbecome a synonym for the global financial meltdown that shook the world in\n2008 and whose aftershocks are still\nfelt today.\nWhile the precise causes of the 2008\ncrisis are complex, many people, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, have blamed the continuous deregulation of the financial market\nduring the Reagan era. Any attempts to\nreintroduce effective financial regulations in the aftermath of the crisis have\nbeen very successfully undermined, either by political opposition in the U.S.\nor by the indecisiveness of member\nstates of the European Union.\nAll in all, the political elite of the\nwestern world has shown an alarming\nlack of action considering the global\nscale of the recent financial disaster.\nProponents of the deregulated market\nhave been quick to point out that the\nfree market is the pillar of western de-mocracy. Since the free market creates\na healthy economy and growth, they\nargue, it fundamentally helps creating\na healthy, democratic society, and thus\nany financial regulation is potentially\nharmful not only to the markets, but\nto society as a whole. This point, how-ever, is based on the misconception\nthat democracy and free market capitalism are pursuing the same goals, or\nare even based on the same concepts. It\nrequires only a short analysis to recognize the flaws in this conception.\nDemocracy is fundamentally based\non the concept of equality, most notably the equal weight of votes cast by\neach individual member of society, as\nwell as the concept of equality before\nthe law. However, in order for each\ncitizen to access his given right and\nduty of political participation, he or she\nneeds to be in the position to make an\ninformed choice. From this idea, one\ncan derive the right to equal access to\ninformation and education for each individual in a democratic society. Since\npeople living in extreme poverty cannot be expected to take an active role in\nsociety in the midst of a daily struggle\nfor survival, democracies have a duty\nto provide a certain level of care to allow every individual in need a certain\nstandard of living. Following the same\nline of reasoning, it can be understood\nthat large social inequalities are actu-The overlaps between the basic tenets of democracy and capitalism are\nthus smaller than normally perceived.\nIn fact, some concepts of capitalism are\nin direct conflict with the democratic\nideals of equality. In January 2010 it\nwas reported that the German Free\nDemocratic Party (FDP) had received\na donation of 1.1 million Euros from\nBaron August von Fink, one of the\nrichest Germans and owner of a range\nof hotels. Two days after getting into\npower as the junior partner in a coalition with Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian\nDemocrats, the FDP pushed for a highly controversial law to cut the VAT on\nhotel room bookings. While the FDP\nfaced a fair amount of criticism from\nthe general population, their actions\nwere perfectly legal under German\nlaw. But this idea that the wealthy can\nso openly influence politics fundamentally undermines the equality principle\nof democracy.\nThe reluctance of politicians to introduce effective regulations of the financial market after the 2008 crisis only\ncontinues a basic trend in the western\nworld, that where necessary, the ideals of democracy are bent in favor of\ncapitalist ideas. The scale of the 2008\nevents, as well as the aftermath and\nthe current Eurozone crisis show the\ngrave consequences of this trend. In\nthis situation, some members of leftist\nparties all over Europe and especially\nin Greece have been calling for a return to socialist principles. These calls\nfor abandoning capitalism altogether\nin order to save democracy are equally\nflawed however. The past has shown\nthat socialist societies are not able to\nsurvive without radically infringing on\nthe freedoms of individuals. The perfect unison of democracy and socialism\nonly ever existed in Marx\u2019 and Engel\u2019s\nminds.\nRather, the west should shift focus\non protecting the values of democracy\nas the highest good of society and bend\nand restrict the ideals of the free market wherever they infringe on those\nvalues. It is obvious that the values of\ncapitalism and democracy are idealised\nconcepts and a working marriage of the\ntwo has always been based on tradeoffs.\nIn pushing for effective regulations of\nthe financial markets, politicians are\ngiven the opportunity to readjust what\ncan be perceived as a dangerous imbalance between free marked ideas and\ndemocratic principles that has manifested over the last decades. If such a\nreadjustment cannot be achieved in the\naftermath of the biggest financial crisis\nin decades, it is unlikely it ever will be.\nTim Zuehlsdorff\n\u201cThe overlaps are\nsmaller than usually\nperceived\u201d\n\n"

The club\nhas definitely grown since last year,\nthough..\nFS: What kind of netballing experience do you guys have?\nFK: I\u2019ve been playing at uni since\nmy first year, but there\u2019s a bit of a story behind it...I accidentally signed up\nfor the medics in fresher\u2019s fair! I only\nswitched back after a year. I got into\nnetball at school, though.\nLucie Hazell: I only started in my\nsecond year, actually. I hadn\u2019t played it\nsince I was fourteen, but once I got into\nit I just got more and more competitive,\nand now I\u2019m club captain!\nFS: What do you find appealing\nabout netball, as opposed to, say,\nbasketball?\nFK: It\u2019s faster-paced than people\nthink it is, even though you can\u2019t move\nwhen you hold the ball.\nLH: If you\u2019re being serious about it,\nit can become a very tactical game...\nYou can appreciate people not seeing\nthe appeal from the outside, most guys\ndon\u2019t get it either but once you start\nplaying it\u2019s actually loads of fun.\nFS:Speaking of guys, should they\never be allowed to play netball?\nLH:You\u2019d have to make the posts\nhigher! I don\u2019t see why not though.\nFS:Maybe mixed netball?\nFK:I think England netball organise\ndiscovery sessions which let guys try\nout netball.\nLH:We had \u201cFun day\u201d last year,\nwhere a few guys played, and we organise a grudge match every year against\nthe rugby club \u2013 although like I said,\nthe posts are too short for them, so they\nget an unfair advantage!\nFS:What leagues do you play in?\nFK:Both BUCS and ULU. The 1s are\ndoing really well this year, as they are\nsecond of their division!\nFS:That\u2019s pretty good \u2013 how often\ndo you train, and what does it in-volve?\nLH:We train once a week, two hours,\nall together. Our coach used to play\nnetball for imperial, and she\u2019s doing a\ngreat job for all levels. We start off with\nsome fitness, and then do drills with the\nball, and then practice matches. The\ndrills are good for all levels, especially\nthe people who have never played before \u2013 we have quite a lot this year!\nFS:So the club is growing nicely\nthen?\nFK:Yes, I think particularly this year:\nwe had a lot of people at fresher\u2019s fair\ncoming up to us saying they\u2019d never\nplayed before, which wasn\u2019t really\nthe case in previous years. This year\nthere is a new committee, and I feel\nthe dynamic of the club is changing a\nbit, becoming more open. There was a\nfeeling in previous years that the whole\nthing was a bit elitist, with the committee members all from the higher teams,\nand the first team captain would be\nclub captain too. It\u2019s not necessarily a\nbad thing, because it gives a very competitive edge to the club, but I think it\ndid put some beginners off.\nFS:Just to clarify, which team do\nyou play for, Lucie?\nThe thirds! So the club mindset has\nchanged somewhat, in that sense.\nFS:You also mentioned a \u2018social\nteam\u2019 \u2013 what is that exactly?\nLH:Well, it\u2019s for the people who don\u2019t\nwant to play on a BUCS team, or who\njust want to enjoy themselves \u2013 I\u2019d say\nthe majority of the club is made up of\nthe 4th and 5th teams (the 5th team being the social team \u2013 Ed.) We\u2019re trying\nto get the 5th team into ULU next year,\nbut at the moment the team captain has\njust organising informal matches. The\nRoyal College of Music are starting up\na team, so we play them, as well as the\nRSM.\nFS:Speaking of playing other fac-ulties, let\u2019s have your thoughts on\nvarsity! Any aims for this year? How\ndid it go last year?\nFK:I think we have a good chance\nSport Editor\nIndy Leclercq\nIndy Leclercq\nCaptains\u2019 Interviews:\nNetball\nEssential info:\nFeroza Kassam, 23\nClub Treasurer\n4th year Civil Engineering\n10 years\u2019 experience\nLucie Hazell, 21\nClub captain\n4th year Civil Engineering\n2 years\u2019 experience\nthis year\u2026We won two out of five last\nyear, which was amazing, a really good\nresult.

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 17\nIn the tweet of the moment\nPirates of Carthage looks at social media\u2019s pivotal role in bringing down Ben Ali\nWill Prince\nBeyond being an interminable stream\nof the thoughts of Lethal Bizzle, Twitter for this reviewer had always been\njust another tool for procrastination.\nIn 2006, many of the angel investors\nrunning their rule over the nascent\nmicroblogging site figured the same.\nTo have said to them then that tweets\nof 140 characters would one day be\nenough to catalyse the downfall of\ngovernments, they would have dismissed you as mad. How wrong they\nall were.\nPirates of Carthage follows the\nmonth or so centred around Christmas\n2010 that saw the demise of the Ben\nAli regime in Tunisia. It takes a unique\napproach to the story telling \u2013 we see\nthe events unfold through the tweets\nof a select few commentators, both in\nTunisia and abroad, deftly woven with\npertinent footage from across the web\nand extracts from classical literature.\nUsing multiple projectors and a cast\nof four to recite the tweets, Pirates of\nCarthage fittingly bombards the audience with information, \u2018fusing\u2019 as its\nwriter, Dan Kelly, explains, \u2018spoken\nword, video montage and Tunisian\nHip-Hop\u2019.\nThe result is a highly informative,\nif impassive, piece of theatre that explores the increasingly significant impact of virtual social media on the real\nworld. Drawing references from pop\nculture as well as nineteenth century\nliterature, Kelly encourages his audience to look beyond their normally\nmundane use of the Internet and see its\nrole in writing the history of our age:\nas on one screen a cursor idly clicks its\nway through iPlayer, on another, the\nJasmin Revolution gains momentum\non Twitter.\nAt times the format is quite repetitive \u2013 knowing how the story ends\ncertainly had it benefits as the last few\nminutes began to grind \u2013 but no criticisms can be made of its ingenuity. I\ncommend the production\u2019s efforts to\nlet facts drive the narrative but I was\nstruck by how sparingly the cast was\nused \u2013 they were more storytellers\nthan actors \u2013 and I found myself at\ntimes hungry for a little more humanity and, dare I say it, emotion in the\ncharacters behind the tweets.\nAs contemporary theatre goes, Pirates of Carthage couldn\u2019t have embraced social media much better. I\ncan\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anything else that\neffectively tells its narrative from the\nperspective of the Internet, and I very\nmuch doubt this will be the last. And\nat least until then, as I despair over\nyet another tweet about how amazing\nSherlock is, I can know that somewhere else on the Twittersphere someone is using their 140 characters for a\nnobler cause. Ahem, Life Sciences.\nPirates of Carthage is showing at\nThe Nellie Dean 23-24 January,\ntickets \u00a35.\nNorth Africa\u2019s Got Talent had whittled thousands of hopefuls down to its final four\nJoin Felix.\nAt the very least, you\u2019ll get a place to kip at lunchtime\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

I\u2019ll explain, I\nwas reading a newspaper that wasn\u2019t Felix (treason, I know, I wouldn\u2019t recommend that anyone else EVER does this).\nI was just browsing the news section, as\nI\u2019m an intellectual/was trying to look intellectual in the hope that a girl in a coffee shop would notice me and be enam-oured. It didn\u2019t work (damn you revision\nbeard, you make me look unkempt \u2013 in a\nbad way, not like a loveable rogue), but\nI did manage to see something so obvious that I was surprised people are not\nup in arms about it. The newspaper was\nincredibly unsubtle in its bias. It was obvious what it wanted you to take away\nfrom the news story. It was, at times, so\nclear what side it was leaning towards,\nthat it was bordering on being one giant\ncomment section (being the Comment\nEditor, that would be both awesome and\nincredibly destructive to my degree).\nOn reading a news story, I actually did\na double take and assumed I was being\nparanoid. That wasn\u2019t possible. I said in\nmy head, as they\u2019re listening ALL THE\nTIME. I was looking too much into\nthings, and taking some subtle slight\ntoo seriously. Maybe it says something\nabout me that I\u2019m doing this. Admittedly, that\u2019s entirely possible. Luckily, I\u2019m\nnot the only one to notice. For example,\nI think we all know what the Daily\nMail\u2019s views on life are (oh, and, sorry,\nbut reading this article gives you cancer\nand makes paedophilic immigrants befriend your children).\nYou may say I\u2019m slow on the uptake.\nThe thing is, I did notice this a long time\nKim Jong-Jesus?\nMedia bias just flies right by us\nago, thought \u2018meh, that\u2019s just the way\nthey roll\u2019and ignored it. Ever since then,\nI think I\u2019ve trained my brain to just use\nvacuum filtration on the article and only\ncollect the precipitate (or facts \u2013 jokes\nlike that prove that I bear the scars of\nrecent revision).\nIf anything, obvious bias is possibly\nless sinister than subtle undercurrents of\npersuasion. Reading a story and thinking \u2018yeah that\u2019s their spin on it\u2019 means\nthat they\u2019ve been a bit too heavy-hand-ed. What they aim to do is implant an\nidea in your brain (Inception style, minus Leo) that you just naturally conclude from reading the article.\nThis leads me on to the future of the\nprint media. I think that if there were to\nbe a newspaper, physical and electronic,\nthat provided factual, well-researched,\nun-biased news it would be something I\nwould like to read. The idea that I could\nread a news story and then draw my own\nconclusions without someone trying to\nforce their opinion on me is quite nice.\nThey would, of course, have a Comment\nsection where the newspaper could give\nits comment and opinion on the news.\nHowever, this would be a separate sec-tion; the news would be left to the News\nsection and the comment to the Comment. That\u2019s sort of how it was meant to\nbe. You may say that this, rather handily,\ngets rid of the hypocrisy of writing in\na Comment section about how newspapers should have less comment. My\npoint is really boiling down to this: in a\nserious paper\u2019s News section, I expect\nfactual reporting that tells you what\u2019s\nhappening. In the Comment section, I\ncan find analysis and someone\u2019s opinion on what\u2019s going on. When reading a\nperson\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s them saying what\nE\nveryone ought to love,\nserve, even worship me\nabove all else.\u201d What a\nsinister, egotistic and deranged thing to say! If you\nmet someone who really believed that\nabout themselves, you would probably\nnot want to meet them a second time.\nBut isn\u2019t that what Christians believe\nabout God? When Jesus was asked\nwhich commandment was most im-portant, he answered: \u201cYou shall love\nthe Lord your God with all your heart\nand with all your soul and with all\nyour mind and with all your strength.\u201d\nDoesn\u2019t that prove the point? Like a\nNorth Korean dictator, God seems to\ndemand nothing less than wall-to-wall\nadoration!\nImagine finally reaching that distant\nlight at the end of the tunnel \u2013 leaving\nImperial \u2013 and getting a job offer (an\nunlikely scenario, I know). The job de-scription: with every waking moment\nyou must pursue with resolute determination your own happiness. Vast\nresources and all the help you could\nask for are at your disposal. You might\nstart out trying to buy satisfaction: a\nsuit, a yacht, a peerage \u2013 whatever does\nit for you. If those didn\u2019t hit the spot,\nyou might turn to art, music and natural beauty for happiness. Failing that,\nperhaps relationships: marriage and\nchildren, or maybe just a goldfish for\nthe time being. The latter two categories will probably offer you a degree\nof satisfaction; appreciating that which\nis beautiful, and loving someone who\nloves you in return could be the most\nprofound joys of all. That is what worship is. Forget prostration and mindless\nchanting; Christian worship is all about\nappreciating God\u2019s beauty and delighting in our relationship with him. And\nsince he outshines anything you\u2019ll see\nin the world, and his love is more loyal\nthan that of a mother, worship turns out\nto be a hedonist\u2019s best course of action!\nSo when God commands us to worship\nand love him, he is actually telling us\nto pursue our best chance of happiness.\nThat\u2019s a command I\u2019m happy to obey.\nBut that might still leave us with\nthe impression that God is needy, like\na ronery North Korean premier, or an\nImperial student desperate for love and\naffection. Was God lonely before he\nmade people that he could relate to?\nDid he create humans so that he could\nthey think, so I\u2019m ready for someone to\ngive a bit of a one-sided view to support\ntheir argument. They are, after all, trying\nto get me to agree with what they think.\nThat\u2019s the point, and the beauty, of the\nComment section: everyone can voice\ntheir view on a particular topic of their\nchoosing. They can use facts to support\ntheir argument, but they are not just aiming to deliver you facts. They are, like\na woman/man talking to a bisexual man\nthat she/he fancies, trying to swing you\none way rather than the other.\nAnother way that I think print media\ncould survive, if it wishes to, is by becoming the gold standard. You can get\nyour news from all the 24 hour news\nchannels and websites nowadays. The\ntrouble is, often a breaking story will\ndominate. There are many consequences of this. Firstly, you end up getting a\nsaturation of reporting and speculation.\nJust remember the tragedy in Norway\nwhere it was suggested, incorrectly, that\nit was an Islamic terrorist attack. Secondly, it means other news stories are\nswept down the agenda and basically\nforgotten about. What I\u2019m suggesting is\nthat a newspaper, not having to rush to\nimmediately push out some news, could\nhave enough time to investigate things\na bit more. A day isn\u2019t too long, but it\ncould help them fact-check.\nOf course, this is the real world. It\nis impossible for someone to be completely unbiased. Why? Because of who\nwrites the news. Humans. We are all\nhuman, not automatons. We will all, in-variably, without even realising it, write\nsomething a bit biased when reporting\nfacts. It\u2019s impossible not to. Whether it\u2019s\nconsciously making it out as if an experiment has gone well when it hasn\u2019t,\nbe fulfilled in some way? The Christian\nanswer is that even before time existed,\nGod was already enjoying perfect relationships in a community of three.\nIn God there are three \u2018people\u2019: Father, Son and Spirit, having their own\nthoughts, actions and personalities. Not\nthree gods, but one god in three per-sons. So unlike a singular god, the god\nof the Bible created not so that he could\nbe loved, but to share the love he already had. We may flatter ourselves by\nsuggesting that God needs us, but ultimately we need him. The best attempts\nof the human race to find satisfaction\napart from God have left even the most\naccomplished men in history insecure,\nunfulfilled and facing death with uncer-tainty. So the better question isn\u2019t \u201cIs\nGod needy?\u201d but \u201cWho needs God?\u201d\n... this is the\nreal world. It\nis impossible\nfor someone to\nbe completely\nunbiased... we\nare all human, not\nautomatons.\nor subconsciously wording something\nin a particular way, it\u2019s unavoidable. I\nthink that if a newspaper, or any news\noutlet, said, okay, we are not machines,\nso let\u2019s put some safeguards in to ensure\nwe are as fair as possible. Don\u2019t ask me\nwhat these would be. I guess having a\nlot of people separately read it and flag\nanything they think is too biased. Even\nthen it\u2019s possible they would only tell\npeople about stuff they don\u2019t agree with.\nSo I accept that you can\u2019t eliminate bias\ncompletely, but you can keep it to a\nminimum.\nI\u2019ll end this by explaining why I say\nit flies right by us. Obviously, it was\nthe catchiest title I could think of. Also,\neven if it doesn\u2019t fly by us, we are so resigned to it that we ignore it and so how\nprevalent and influential it is whizzes\npast us; we forget that it could be affecting others. Then again, I guess I am\npretty biased.\nZooey Deschanel?

    "content": "SHERLOCK SPECIAL\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 23\n...in memory of the nation\u2019s favourite detective\nS\no the second series of the\nBBC\u2019s brilliant Sherlock has\ncome to an end. The first series showed that it is possible\nto make a fresh, modern television adaptation while remaining impressively faithful to the hundred year old source ma-terial. The second showed that the creative\nteam has lost none of their spark in the\nintervening time.\nThe first episode \u2018A Scandal\nin Belgravia\u2019, (in my opinion\nthe best of the three making\nup this year\u2019s showing) got\nthings off to a great start. It\nstruck the perfect mix of\nreferences to classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories,\nsure to raise a smile with\navid Holmes fans, and an\nexciting new conflict with\nIrene Adler. Like in the\nGuy Ritchie Holmes film\nher role has been far expanded from her one appearance in Doyle\u2019s work\nbut, unlike in the films,\nhere this works. Perhaps\nit is that the chemistry between the actors playing\nAdler and Holmes works\nbetter in the TV show, at\nfirst conveying antagonism\nbefore moving on to, for lack\nof a better phrase, professional\nrespect and, finally, the barest hint\nof something more.\nCertainly the episode\u2019s pacing\nwas far better than that of the films.\nThough some forty minutes shorter than either\nof the movies the lack of the distraction of ever\npresent, over-the-top action scenes allowed far\nmore plot and character development to be fitted\nin. Not that this is all reserved for Holmes and\nAdler \u2013 one of the greatest strengths of \u2018Sherlock\u2019 is the growing friendship between Holmes\nand Watson, which has such dramatic payoff in\nthe last few scenes of the final episode.\nI am, however, getting ahead of myself. \u2018The\nHounds of Baskerville\u2019, the second episode,\nwas probably the weakest of the trio. There was\nnothing technically wrong with it and it was\nperfectly enjoyable, it\u2019s just that while the other\nepisodes feature Holmes pitting his wits against\nan intellect his equal, this, in the end, is just a\nrather simple mystery. There are a few scenes\ndealing with Holmes feeling fear for one of the\nfirst times in his life as a result of being exposed\nto military hallucinogens but this ends up going\nnowhere. In short \u2013 a forgettable interlude that\ncame between two episodes that build well upon\neach other.\nThe show\u2019s finale, \u2018The Reichenbach Fall\u2019, is\ndifficult to analyse. While in many ways a great\nepisode it was also immensely disappointing. To\nexplain why, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll have to move\ninto spoiler territory. The episode deals with\nMoriarty, the consulting criminal introduced at\nthe end of the first series and person revealed\nto be responsible for many of the events of \u2018A\nScandal in Belgravia\u2019, framing Holmes for causing all the crimes that he solves to make himself look good. Moriarty even pretends to be an\nimpoverished actor Holmes hired just so that he\ncould have a nemesis. This is done so well that\neven I began to believe him.\nUnfortunately this leads to a rather significant\nplot hole \u2013 Holmes\u2019 hugely influential brother\nMycroft, of whom Holmes even says that \u201coccasionally he is the British government\u201d. He\nknows very well that Moriarty is not just an\nactor and he could have easily used his connections to show that the evidence against his\nbrother was faked. Holmes\u2019 pride explains why\nhe never asks Mycroft for help but Mycroft himself is shown to care deeply for his brother and\nto want to help \u2013 but he never does, even when\nthe situation gets desperate. He could have even\nprobably had Moriarty assassinated \u2013 after all, it\nis shown that he had no qualms against holding\nhim prisoner illegally and torturing him before\nthe events of the series.\nI am quite vocal in my dislike of plot holes\nbut, while it does come close and is still exceptionally annoying, I\u2019m going have to say that it\ndoesn\u2019t ruin the episode for me. The reason is\nthat, however stupid the means by which they\nget there, Holmes\u2019and Moriarty\u2019s final stand-off\nis genuinely dramatic. You really sense that Moriarty is Holmes\u2019 equal and criminal counterpart\n\u2013 Moriarty\u2019s cry of \u201cYou\u2019re me. You\u2019re me\u201d near\nthe end is genuinely chilling \u2013 and the tension\nbuilds up until the final climax when \u2026 well\nyou might guess from the episode title.\nIn short, while not perfect, this show was\ntruly an engaging watch. The stories were, for\nthe most part, incredibly engaging and the acting was marvellous. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet\nI strongly advise you to catch it while it\u2019s still\non iPlayer.\nFinal episode has more holes than dutch cheese, says Maciej Matuszewski\nBBC\nIs Benedict gonna Cumber-back\nfor another series?\nYES. Producers Steven Moffat and Mark\nGatiss both announced on Twitter that a third\nseries was commissioned at the same time\nas the second. Unfortunately they are also\nresponsible for Doctor Who, which ironically\nconsumes a lot of their time; so the next series\nwill air during 2013 at the earliest.\n\u201cTo explain why, I\u2019m\nafraid I\u2019ll have to move\ninto spoiler territory\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "How we find\nfaces\nMadhura Ghosh\nOur face is one of the main things that\nidentifies us as an individual.\nBabies have a tendency to attend to\nface and \u201cface-like\u201d stimuli (such as a\ntriangle on a point as opposed to on a\nbase). With faces practically hard-wired\ninto our systems from a young age, it\nmakes sense that there is a part of the\nbrain dedicated to recognising faces in\nopposition to non faces \u2013 the fusiform\ngyrus.\nHowever, what is perplexing to scientists is that such a finely tuned organ as\nthe brain appears to have a lot of overlap in function between hemispheres.\nMing Meng and colleagues recently\nhelped clear up this area of murky understanding proving there are indeed\ndifferences between the right and left\nfusiform gyri.\nFirstly, the results show that the right\nfusiform gyrus tends to make face/\nnon-face categorical judgements. As\nin, there is a clear cut-off point. In con-trast, activity in the left fusiform gyrus\nappears to correspond to face similarities within an image. This is modulated\nby contextual information \u2013 an almost\nmental sharpening by enhancing responses to faces and diminishing them\ntowards almost faces.\nSo, when we look at the \u2018faces\u2019 of inanimate objects, such as a car for exam-ple; I imagine the response in the brain\ngoes a little like this:\nRight Fusiform gyrus: \u201cThat is not a\nface.\u201d\nLeft Fusiform gyrus: \u201cIt\u2019s a little too\nsquare and metallic for a face, but look\nit\u2019s smiling!\u201d\nIn the right hemisphere, as a categorical judgment has been made, there is no\nreal enhancement or change.\nThis could possibly lead you to be-lieve, with such a quick initial judgement being passed, that the right fusiform gyrus undertakes the rapid initial\nprocessing. As with many things concerning the brain, it is not that simple.\nThrough careful studies, scientists have\nworked out that responses in the left\nside occur within two seconds of seeing\nthe image and diminish quickly (cor-relating with rapid processing) while\nresponses on the right can last up to\neight seconds indicating deep cognition\nof faces.\nHowever, this research is not simply\nabout finding out where our childish\nability to delight in face-like forms arises from. With the brain being as intricate and delicate as it is, problems can\neasily occur. Though our understanding\nis currently limited; research such as\nthis that furthers our knowledge brings\nus one step closer to treating and helping a multitude of neurologically damaged patients.\nDOI: 10.1098/rspb.2011.1784\nSCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 9\nThe brain is king\nMarie-Laure Hicks on how marketing companies are trying to tap into your brain\nA\ns the economic crisis\ncontinues, companies are\ndeveloping new methods\nto make you buy, by going straight to the source:\nyour brain. Marketing and advertisement\nhave generally relied on focus groups and\nsurveys to determine the efficiency of a\ncampaign. This method poses a problem\nas it is difficult to measure a spontaneous\nreaction. Participants are asked a question\nand therefore consciously think about it,\nbut 95% of consumer buying behaviour is\nunconscious. This is where neuroscience\ncomes in.\nIn 2003, Read Montague and colleagues at the Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, decided to investigate the\nPepsi Challenge with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Volunteers were given Pepsi or Coca Cola to\ndrink, first in unlabelled cups. They were\nthen given Pepsi or Coca Cola in labelled\ncups. Read Montague and colleagues\nmeasured brain activity as the volunteers\nsipped the beverage. The results were\nastonishing. Concerning the unlabelled\ndrinks, volunteers expressed no distinct\ntaste preference and most volunteers were\nunable to identify the brand. However,\nwhen the drinks were labelled, the drink\nin the Coca Cola labelled cup was clearly\npreferred. The parts of the brain that were\nstimulated also varied. For the unlabelled\ncup, volunteers expressed high activity in\nthe ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, associated with appetitive rewards. When\nthe cups were labelled, the hippocampus,\nmidbrain and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were also stimulated. These regions of\nthe brain are linked to emotions, memory\nand affective influence on behaviour. The\ntext showed that in the case of Coke and\nPepsi, taste was not the only factor necessary for preference: there was also a cultural factor linked to the brand.\nA number of studies on brand loyalty\nhave taken place since. They show that\nthe cerebral behaviour of loyal customers\nis different to that of irregular customers in purchasing situations. Brand loyalty was associated with activity in the\nstriatum, ventro-medial prefrontal cortex\nand anterior cingulate cortex, a network\nlinked with emotions and rewards. On the\nother hand, when brand loyalty was not\ninvolved in a purchase choice, the brain\nactivity patterns corresponded to more\nsemantic processes like mathematical\ncalculations, reading and strategic think-ing. In the consumer society, successful\nbrands are those that form an emotional\nlink with their customer.\nThese findings are now being applied\nin neuromarketing to determine the efficiency of advertisement campaigns,\npackaging and brand image. NeuroFocus,\nan American company, uses three factors\nto determine the efficiency of ads: atten-tion, emotional engagement and memory\nretention. Using an electroencephalogram (EEG), they are able to measure the\nchanges in electrical fields in regions of\nthe brain as a function of time. This method does not provide the same information\nas an fMRI. The location of the brain activity is not very accurate and signals deep\ninside the brain are difficult to measure,\nhowever being able to follow changes in\nbrain activity on a second by second basis\nis very useful. It is also cheaper. Using results from ADHD, Alzheimer\u2019s and phobia research, the different factors can be\nmeasured and quantized. The effectiveness of EEG measurements was verified\nby asking volunteers subjected to tests,\nwhilst viewing adverts, related questions.\nMemorable and positive reception was\nlinked to increased brain activity.\nMarketing companies are now beginning to apply these theories. A Fanta\nadvert, in which a girl crashes into a\nwindow, then walks off to start dancing\nand drink some Fanta given to her, was\nstudied by Brain Impact, a European\ncompany studying unconscious decisions\nwith fMRI. When the girl crashes into\nthe window it triggers a peak of negative emotion, grabbing your attention\nand the ending then generates a positive\nemotion.

With the absence of reg-ulation, neuromarketing has potentially\ndangerous applications and could affect\nthe freedom of choice of customers, especially as political campaigns are showing\ninterest in neuromarketing.\nCan I interest you in some car insurance?

I shall not skip breakfast again\nYou might have been told over and over\nagain about breakfast being important.\nBut it\u2019s damn true: breakfast is the most\nimportant meal of the day and without\nit you\u2019re like Justin Bieber without a\nfringe.\nPeople tend to miss breakfast either\nbecause they\u2019re in a rush or because\nthey think that this will help them lose\nweight. Either way, lack of energy and\ngain of weight will be the inevitable re-sults.\nWhen you wake up, your body has\nbeen without fuel for about 8-9 hours\n(for Imperial students, 5-6 hours). Refueling properly will help you function\nefficiently and perform as best as you\ncan.\n2. I shall not waste food\nNo, I don\u2019t mean to eat whatever you\nhave in your fridge and cupboards\nbefore it expires. You should always\nbuy based on your needs (and wants).\nNever overdo it. Make a list of things\nyou need and stick to it once you enter\nthe doors of the super market. Offers\nmay be tempting but you are a good\nboy/girl and have a resolution to ful-fill. Try it and see for yourself; you\u2019ll\nend up spending less money and your\nfridge won\u2019t get this weird smell that\nyou never want to find the source of.\n3. I shall not visit the\nminimarket\nThe corner shop can destroy you\nhealth-wise. There are plenty of reasons to avoid a visit: it\u2019s more expensive than super markets; it offers\nless choice; and you usually end up\nbuying crap like biscuits, crisps, soft\ndrinks and chocolate bars. I\u2019m not\ntelling you to give up chocolate, that\nwould be a crime! However, it\u2019s not\nhard to realise that once you enter the\nlocal store you will leave with things\nyou certainly didn\u2019t want to buy before you went in. Keep it only for\nemergencies...\n4. I shall drink more\nwine...\n...responsibly.\nWine has a strong personality other\ndrinks don\u2019t have. Whether you\u2019re having steak, chicken, fish, pasta, or even\njust a salad, a glass of the appropriate\nwine does make a difference. Do your\nresearch, compare prices, and you will\nsee that the options are limitless.\n5. I shall grill, not fry\nFried chicken, fried bacon, fried sau-sages, fried eggs. You gotta love \u2018em.\nHowever, it\u2019s 2012 and this is a resolution to be respected. Grilled food is\ngenerally healthier than fried. When\nyou fry food in butter or vegetable\noils you receive a big amount of extra\nsaturated and trans fat, both of which\nare no good.\nOn the other hand, when you grill\nfood, chances are you will use a\nmarinara instead of other sauces to\ngive taste which is again healthier.\nAlso, excess fat will slip through the\ngrooves in the grill compared to the\nfry-pan where all the fat stays (and\nmakes the food delicious).\n6. I shall take advantage\nof my family\nMake a list of meals you can\u2019t cook\nby yourself either because you\u2019re incompetent or just because you \u201ccan\u2019t\nbe bothered\u201d but your mother, sister,\ngrandmother or anyone else in your\nfamily do well. Once the term ends and\nrelief hits you what better than enjoy\nhot, fat, homemade food?\n7. I shall cook more\nCooking can be very creative and most\nimportantly it can be stress relieving.\nFollowing or even creating your own\nrecipe makes you forget anything outside the kitchen. Presenting and tasting\nyour dish will fill you with a feeling of\npride and happiness.\nTry baking a cake. Decorate it. Show\nit to your friends, maybe offer them a\npiece or two. Enjoy it in the morning\nwith coffee, tea or milk.\nTip: Try new recipes: attempt to make\nit lighter by using fewer eggs and less\nbutter, or even no eggs at all. Avoid icing and other toppings; they will just\nfatten the cake without adding any special taste. Use fresh or compote fruits,\nlike strawberries and pinneapple.\nOnce you have perfected your cake\nsend your recipe at food.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk.\n8. I shall go out\nLet\u2019s face the facts: Firstly, you live in\nLondon. Secondly, you study in South\nKensington. Go out! Once every week or\nfortnight visit a restaurant you\u2019ve been\nthinking about. The choice is yours. Italian, French, American, Greek, Chinese,\nTurkish; the choices are unlimited.\nGather your friends and have a nice dinner out... now that you have time \u2013 May\nis not far away!\n9. I shall have a full\nfridge\nNo, I don\u2019t mean hitting the supermar-ket, spending \u00a3100 and filling up your\nfridge. Keep your fridge \u2018updated\u2019 with\nhealthy foods. Always have milk, fruits,\nvegetables, mustard (which is low in fat),\nlow fat cheese (e.g. mozzarella), eggs\netc. That way, even if you get back from\ncollege late at night, or you\u2019re too bored\nto go to the supermarket, you won\u2019t get\ninto the temptation of ordering a delivery\nand making a snack with what you have.\nTip: Fill your fridge every once or twice\na week according to your diet and needs\nand try to have it emptied by the end of\nthe week. Your goal is to receive the correct amount of fruits, vegetables, milk\nand other foods you always neglect to\nget.\n10. I shall contribute to\nthe Food Section\nIs food one of your strongest pas-sions? Got something to share with\nImperial? Want to become the number one Food Section writer of Felix?\nWho doesn\u2019t?

    "content": "FILM\n2012 Golden Globe Awards\nThe long-awaited awards season celebrating\n2011\u2019s best kicked off on Sunday with the Golden\nGlobes, held in the Beverly Hilton Hotel, California.\nWith Ricky Gervais hosting the show for the third\ntime in a row, no-one was spared from his sharp\ntongue insulting Hollywood\u2019s top stars. Johnny\nDepp once again had to endure the mention of\nhis terrible The Tourist, whereas Jodie Foster\u2019s\nThe Beaver, starring Mel Gibson about a man who\nfinds a cure to his depression by a talking puppet\ndrew some laughter at how the film made next to\nnothing at the box office.\nThose not present at the ceremony were not\nexempt from Gervais\u2019 opening monologue, with\nthe British comedian comparing socialite Kim\nKardashian and Kate Middleton to the Golden\nGlobes and the Oscars respectively. \u201cThe Golden\nGlobes,\u201d he said, \u201care just like the Oscars without\nall that esteem. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton: a\nbit louder, bit trashier, bit drunker, and more easily\nbought. Allegedly. Nothing\u2019s been proved.\u201d He also\npicked on NBC, the American television network\nairing the Golden Globes as being the \u201cfourth biggest network.\u201d A highly unflattering remark, since\nthere are only five basic competitive primetime\nchannels in the United States (ABC, CBS, FOX and\nCW being the other four).\nWhen it came to the winners, there were hardly any surprises in store. Christopher Plummer\n(Beginners) and Octavia Spencer (The Help) took\nhome the gold for their supporting gigs, Madonna was awarded Best Original Song for her effort\n\u2018Masterpiece\u2019 in her new film W.E. with Hollywood\nveterans Martin Scorsese (Hugo) and Woody Allen (Midnight in Paris) each winning an award for\nBest Director and Best Screenplay respectively.\nAlthough Steven Spielberg\u2019s much-lauded War\nHorse left empty-handed, his another hit, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn managed to win Best Animated Film.\nThe Best Foreign Language Film honour went to\nA Separation an outstanding Iranian film which had\nalready been awarded the top prize last February\nat the Berlin Film Festival.\nJean Dujardin (The Artist) and Michelle Williams\n(My Week with Marilyn) were deservedly awarded\nfor their efforts in the comedy category of the\nGolden Globes, with The Artist, a silent, black-and-white film, ultimately taking home the Best Motion\nPicture \u2013 Comedy award.\nMeryl Streep further cemented her reputation\nby winning her eigth Golden Globe for her portrayal\nof Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady in the category Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, with the ever-so handsome\n(something Gervais even acknowledged) and still\nunmarried George Clooney being honoured for his\nperformance in Alexander Payne\u2019s The Descendants. Director Payne\u2019s latest film about a grieving\nfather in Hawaii who finds out about his comatose\nwife\u2019s infidelity also took home the top prize, Best\nMotion Picture \u2013 Drama.\nThis is a true masterpiece. It\u2019s certainly one of\nthe most emotional films of recent times, with\nthe last fifty minutes or so being a veritable\nrollercoaster of ups and downs. This is Spielberg at his absolute finest \u2013 so tearjerkingly\nperfect that I am quite sure there were no dry\neyes in the cinema when I left. It was a difficult\nact to follow \u2013 Michael Morpurgo\u2019s fiercely\npopular original novel was extremely highly\nrated, not to mention the theatrical production which is consistently awarded five stars\nand has been called \u201cthe play of the decade\u201d.\nHowever, Spielberg\u2019s portrayal of a wonderful\nstory has set an extremely high standard for\nthe rest of the films in 2012, as well as earning\nitself Golden Globe nominations for \u2018Best Picture: Drama\u2019 and \u2018Best Original Score\u2019.\nShot mostly in Devon, the film tells the tale\nof Joey, a thoroughbred horse, owned by a\npoor tenant farmer (Mullan) and loved by the\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n26\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nhorse. Considering no animals were harmed\nin the making, the terror of the horses is very\nrealistically portrayed, and kudos must go to\nthe film\u2019s chief horse trainer Bobby Lovgren\nfor that, as well as for managing a whopping\n280 horses in a single scene.\nAlthough the film is nearly two and a half\nhours long, you are never bored. The viewer is\nheld gripped in Joey\u2019s tale as he roves through\nthe war \u2013 the beauty and tragedy enhanced\nby John Williams\u2019 impressive score and Janusz Kaminski\u2019s stirring cinematography. My\nonly criticism is a slightly slow start for the\nfirst twenty minutes or so, but otherwise War\nHorse just cannot be faulted, and is as good\na film as we\u2019ve ever seen from the director \u2013\nwho is hailing this as one of his finest works.\nThe film is genuinely emotional, unflinchingly real, epic, and imaginative \u2013 an absolute\nmust-see.\nSpielberg\u2019s equine First World War\nLucy Wiles\nDirector Steven Spielberg\nScreenwriters Lee Hall, Richard Curtis,\nMichael Morpurgo (play)\nCast Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson, Tom\nHiddleston, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan\nWar Horse\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t\nend up like that one in The Godfather\nHer Madgesty takes on the royal family\nJohn Park\nDirector Madonna\nScreenwriters Madonna, Alek Keshishian\nCast Abbie Cornish, Andrea Riseborough,\nJames D\u2019Arcy, Oscar Isaac\nW.E. role well, as she acts as the only person holding\nthe film together.\nIn a recent interview, Madonna was oddly proud\nthat she gave many invasive, nostalgic shots with\nher narrower lenses (16mm and Super 8mm cam-eras). Yes, the grainy close-ups that 8mm cameras\ngenerate do give off a warm, sentimental ambi-ance, but only when used appropriately. What\nMadonna cannot resist doing is use it every few\nseconds. With a massive lack of focus and far too\nmany narrative breaks, it\u2019s ugly and chaotic, with\nheadache-inducing camera-work adding hardly\nany positive qualities to the overall product. Who\nknew a romantic drama could cause so much discomfort to the eyes?\nGood news then, that Madonna nabbed many\nof the industry\u2019s great technical geniuses to make\nthe more obvious aspects look and sound amaz-ing. The costumes, provided by Arianne Phillips,\nare simply divine. Wallis goes through as many as\n83 costume changes, and the variety of wardrobe\nRiseborough is given is an impressive collection.\nAbel Korzeniowski\u2019s score is a grand, sweeping\npiece of work that inputs dramatic grandeur to a\nfilm struggling to hold your attention. But again,\nMadonna doesn\u2019t know how to show restraint, and\ndecides toinclude the music infullforce whenever\nit is used. It over-rides the dialogue, and just as you\nthought the music could not get any more bombas-tic, Madonna finds a way and makes it excruciating for the ears.\nW.E. had some great start-up material, Madonna was armed with pretty costumes, triumphant\nsoundtrack and let\u2019s not forget the camera lenses.\nBut she threw them all away to make a superficial,\nshallow period film, because of her inability to\nshow an ounce of restraint.\nMadonna doesn\u2019t exactly have a great track record when it comes to the film industry. Both\nher acting and directorial debuts were widely\npanned, and subsequent attempts to make a name\nfor herself have not quite worked out. W.E. is her\nsecond behind-the-camera effort, and whilst it\nwould be wrong to completely ignore her passion project, W.E. is unlikely to do wonders for\nher film career.\nThe film follows two parallel stories in two\ndifferent time periods. One is of Wallis Simpson\n(Riseborough) and her blossoming romance with\nKing Edward VIII (D\u2019Arcy), who later abdicates\nhis throne because his government could not allow a twice-divorced American as the wife of its\nmonarch. Obsessed with this \u201cfairy-tale\u201d love\nstory is Wally Winthrop (Cornish), an unhappily\nmarried woman living in modern day New York.\nVisiting the same \u201cWallis-Edward\u201d exhibition\nover and over again, she soaks herself in the atmosphere of their true love and escapes her own\nmiserable life by picturing the life of Wallis and\nEdward. To Wally, the couple shared the perfect\nromance \u2013 and this belief stems from her knowledge that he gave up so much for one woman.\n\u201cWhat must it feel like to be loved that much?\u201d\nShe wonders.\nAs the two separate strands intersect, Madonna pays no attention to the characters but is\nfarmer\u2019s teenage son, Albert (Irvine). When\nWorld War I breaks out, the farmer is forced to\nsell Joey to a kind, keen young Army captain\n(Hiddleston), who takes Joey with him into\nbattle. A heartbroken Albert promises Joey\nthat they\u2019ll see each other again some day \u2013\nand eventually enlists in the army to embark\non a search for his friend. The horse accompanies the captain into war, and from there\ncrosses into enemy territory and embarks on\na hazardous journey, culminating at the Battle\nof the Somme. His tale gives us a glimpse of\nmany aspects of warfare \u2013 from those fighting\nin the front line to those left behind at home.\nAs proven in Saving Private Ryan, depicting\nwarfare is one of Spielberg\u2019s positive strengths.\nThis film is packed with battle scenes, including a memorable suicidal cavalry charge, and\nnot forgetting the Battle of the Somme itself.\nThere are highly commended performances\nfrom Toby Kebbell as a brave Geordie cor-poral, and, in smaller roles, Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Marsan. But, it has to be\nsaid, the most memorable performance is by\n21-year-old Irvine, who \u2013 despite a limited acting repertoire \u2013 portrayed young Arthur with\nsincerity. Of course, a mention must also be\nmade to the fourteen horses that played Joey\nso convincingly, all the way from foal to adult\nmore interested in putting together similar looking objects and events in the two timelines, whilst\nrushing past so many scenes. She seems to be in\na hurry to tell us something \u2013 so imagine everyone\u2019s disappointment when it is revealed that she\ndoes not in fact have much to tell. Random time-stamps on the bottom of the screen try to establish\nsome sort of linear sequence, but when each scene\nis so annoyingly brief, the audience cannot fully\ngrasp what is going on.\nHertendencytomovefastdoeshaveoneadvantage though. It means that we see less of that awful plot of Wally. It\u2019s a combination of Cornish\u2019s\nplain boring performance and repetitive narrative\nthat produces something so infuriatingly tacky.\nThere is a fine line between acting depressed, and\nsimply looking dull. For Cornish, it\u2019s unfortunately the latter. It gets worse when Wally starts \u201cseeing\u201d Wallis and it\u2019s embarrassing when the spirit\nof Wallis guides Wally as some sort of guardian\nangel. It\u2019s not moving, nor is it emotional \u2013 instead\nit\u2019s creepy, and makes Wally look like a lunatic.\nThe existence of her alcoholic, abusive husband\nmeansWallyneedsaloveinterest,whichshedoes\nget (Isaac), although this also is cooked up in such\na clumsy way between the two actors who are allowed to share virtually no chemistry, since the\nscript doesn\u2019t give them any room to develop.\nWhen it comes to the English romance, D\u2019Arcy\nstruggles to connect with the character of Wallis, let alone with himself, as his flat performance\ndoes little to convince of their \u201cRomance of the\nCentury\u201d.

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n12\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nAnother week sees another potential closure by College. Hot on the heels of an ongoing campaign for the continuation of the\nHolland Club, many have responded to the\nnews of the possible closure of Clayponds\nhalls of residence in South Ealing, with a\nconsensus that the loss of such an establishment would be detrimental to the College community.\nYet the news of the closure surfaced\nthrough rumour, with the Rector himself providing an official response to a postgraduate\u2019s concerns via email. Is it acceptable\nfor postgraduates to be informed about the\nreasoning behind such a decision in this\nmanner? Indeed, the matter here is the representation of the student, and of others in\nresidence at Clayponds, and how it could\nbe handled with, perhaps, more sensitivity\ntowards their needs..\nThe fact that Clayponds residents have\nreadily contested the plans in defence of\nthe Clayponds \u201ccommunity\u201d, even before\nconfirmation of the intended closure of\nthe site, suggests that the handling of\nthe views of postgraduates was not handled nearly as well as it could have been.\nCollege may have appeared to have taken\nthe decision without fully appreciating the\nchannels that exist; channels that take into\naccount the opinions of perhaps, a wider\nvariety of students who could provide valuable information and opinion, as indeed they\nhave done in correspondence with this very\nnewspaper.\nOne such channel is the Student Union.\nComments made by Union President Scott\nHeath accentuate the \u201cdisappointment\u201d in\nthe fact that the Union has so far had no\nsay on any of the plans. It is hard to disagree that an entire lack of consultation may\nnot be the best course of action when such\na matter affects a significant proportion of\nthe student body.\nAnd then there is the very real concern of\naffordability of Imperial\u2019s new postgraduate\naccommodation \u2013 Imperial West at Wood\nLane and Griffon Studios in Clapham. The\nRector has outlined a bursary scheme for\nthose who choose to live here next academic year, but when you offer students money\nto live in accommodation, do you really\nhave the pricing right? Imperial must provide affordable accommodation for its students and there is a distinct worry amongst\nthose who have contacted Felix that the\nend of Clayponds will mean the end of affordable accommodation. Now is the time\nfor College to listen closely to those likely\nto be affected by the closure of Clayponds,\nand to ensure that feasible postgraduate\naccommodation is in place for the immediate future.\nFELIX\nVoice of Clayponds must\nbe heard by College\nI\n\u2019ve been helping out at interview\ndays this year. Normally this is\na task I avoid in the same way\nI avoid slapping my own balls\nwith a wooden paddle \u2013 that is,\nby not agreeing to do it when I\u2019m asked\nby my superiors (it happens more than\nyou\u2019d think). However, this year I am\nshort on money and, like all people\nshort on money, I am not averse to a\nlittle ball-slapping in return for cash.\nInterview days at Imperial have\nall the atmosphere of a funeral, with\nworse quality food. The interviewers\nare miserable because they could be\noff somewhere writing down equa-tions. The interviewees are miserable\nbecause they want to go to Cambridge\ninstead. And I\u2019m miserable because\nit\u2019s a fucking Wednesday and I\u2019m\nstanding around in a gaudily-lit box of\na room wondering what kind of catering department can do Hoi Sin duck\nwraps and falafel but somehow fail to\ndo, say, cheese sandwiches.\nI mean I love duck, it\u2019s just \u2013 cheese\nsandwiches, guys. How hard would\nthat be?\nIt\u2019s on days like this that I see evidence of everything that is wrong with\nhow we treat sixth-formers, both as a\nuniversity and a nation. It\u2019s not just\nthat we under-fund their education and\nthen complain when they\u2019re not up to\nscratch. It\u2019s the sheer amount of pressure we pour on them \u2013 you\u2019d think\nthey had a life expectancy of about\nthirty years. They\u2019re so focused on\nwhat this decision will mean for the\nrest of their life that they seem to forget just how much life they have left\nto live. I know people who have done\nthree degrees and changed career four\ntimes. Yet people are captivated by the\nidea that if you don\u2019t get into Imperial you might as well top yourself,\nbecause there\u2019s no way in hell you\u2019re\ngoing to leave Birmingham otherwise.\nAs much as I love Imperial, I feel\nit contributed about as much to my\noverall education as many other institutions would have done. People seem\nto think that enthusiastic, motivated\nand talented educators are only able to\nexist inside the walls of Cambridge,\nOxford or Imperial, and that the atmospheric composition of places like\nSouthampton or York or Edinburgh\ncauses anyone with half a brain to as-phyxiate. Merely thinking of entering\na university that isn\u2019t in the top ten\nof one league table or another causes\nyour IQ to drop by eighty points.\nYou know as well as I do that, while\nwe\u2019re blessed with some excellent\npeople at Imperial and some good fa-cilities, careers aren\u2019t made or broken\nsimply by the name on your degree\n(unless you\u2019re in the proportion of Imperial\u2019s population who want as much\nas possible for as little effort as can\nbe gotten away with, in which case\nfeel free to choke on your own tongue\nnext time you\u2019re knocking back vials of baby tears or whatever you do\nfor fun). You\u2019re the one responsible\nfor securing your future, and that can\nbe done almost anywhere if you\u2019re\nwilling to put forth the effort. That\u2019s\nRejection isn\u2019t the end of\nthe world\nStock photo of an interview, or some seriously niche porn? You decide...\nwhy it\u2019s important that sixth-formers\nspend the time choosing their subject\nfor university, rather than the institu-tion. Talking to a lot of the interview-ees, however, I\u2019m left with a very different impression.\nMaybe that\u2019s alright, or unavoid-able, or not anyone\u2019s fault at all. I\ndoubt it, somehow. Imperial\u2019s past\nRectors have often tried their best to\nelevate Imperial\u2019s status, to make it\nequal to Oxford or Cambridge as if\nthis will make it a better university\nsimply because people think it is. The\nmost interesting researchers I\u2019ve met\nthis year were working out of Essex,\nand they seemed perfectly content\nwith their position in life. I imagine it\nrubs off on students as well.\nWe chuckle about how we overwork ourselves here, but it\u2019s less\nfunny to watch first-years weep into\ntextbooks every May \u2013 and those are\nthe ones who managed to get in. The\nsixth-formers that are dreading every\nmorning\u2019s post right now are honestly\nharming themselves by stressing over\nthese interviews and decisions that\nthey somehow perceive as major life\nchoices.\nComing to Imperial might change\nyour life, of course. But most likely\nyou\u2019ll still be the same person you\nwere beforehand. If, like me, you\u2019re\nworking at an interview day this year,\ntry to impress this on those who turn\nup \u2013 that while Imperial is a fine place\nto be, it\u2019s not a magic bullet, and a rejection from us is not a curse on your\nevery decision from hereon out.\nIt won\u2019t make any difference, of\ncourse, because no-one is listening to\nyou on interview day. But do it any-way. I\u2019ll appreciate it.\nWant to\nwrite \u201cyou\nsuck, I hate\nyou for having a different opinion\nto me\u201d? You\ndo. Wow. You\nhave some\nserious exam\nstress I\nguess. Fine,\nif you really\nneed an out-let, why not\ngo to:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nAs much as I love\nImperial, I feel it\ncontributed about\nas much to my\noverall education\nas many other\ninstitutions would\nhave done\n\u201c\nAs muc\nAs muc\nImperia\nImperia\nAngry Geek\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\nWe all take for granted that when we\nswitch on the tap, clean, drinkable water will pour out. Sadly, for millions of\npeople around the globe, this is not the\ncase.\nThe Problem\nIn many countries, state-funded municipal supplies are expensive, leaving the poorest billion people in the\nworld with no choice but to fend for\nthemselves. While some are able to\ndig their own wells, many rely on\ncommunity-shared sources that cannot sustain a large population. This inexorably leads to perennial droughts.\nFurthermore, the quality of this water is not guaranteed and the lack of\na well-maintained system allows disease to spread very quickly amongst\nthe population.\nOur Solution\nOur solution is Raincatcher Imperial\n\u2013 a university society-turned-charity\nfounded in 2009. We are a branch of\nthe registered UK charity Raincatcher\nand work closely with the local Tanzanian NGO, Caritas, to provide a reliable source of clean water for the people in the region of Tabora by building\nrainwater harvesting systems.\nEvery year since 2009, we have sent\nHave you heard about Raincatcher Imperial?\nout a team of Imperial College students\nto Tanzania to build these water collection systems and to provide essential water sanitation training to the local population. These systems provide\neasy access to uncontaminated water\nby storing rainwater form the rainy\nseason for use during the eight-month-long dry period of the year. In total,\nnearly a million litres of water storage\nhas been set up in schools, universities\nand community buildings. The project\nis supported purely by charitable fundraising through the effort of its team\nmembers and supporters.\nThis Year\u2019s Project\nThis year, we are going to take one\nstep further in reaching our goal of setting up a sustainable water source for\nthe Tanzanian population by carrying\nout two simultaneous projects.\nThe first project is to build tanks to\ncollect, filter and store water in the\ntown of Igunga that will provide water for two schools \u2013 St Leo\u2019s Primary\nSchool and St Margaret\u2019s Secondary\nSchool for Girls. At the moment, the\nmunicipal supply of water is unafford-able and the only other option is for\nstudents to walk over 10 km to collect\nwater from an alternate source. Our\ntanks will have capacities of 20,000\nto 100,000 litres and an estimated lifetime of over 40 years, providing a free,\nsustainable supply of clean water.\nThe second project aims to provide\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n38\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nPavitar Devgon various training schemes for people\nin local villages. We will be focusing\non topics such as water sanitation, hygiene and conservation. We will also\nteach families how to construct their\nown smaller-scale water storage con-tainers, built from easily available or\nlocally-sourced materials. Further, in\ncollaboration with Caritas, we aim to\ntrain a select few to carry on teaching\ntheir fellow community members after\nour departure as part of our \u2018Training\nof Trainers\u2019 scheme.\nGet involved!\nSo what can you do to help? Just look\nout for the many fundraising opportunities Raincatcher will be putting\non throughout the year. Each one will\nbe creative, fun and for a good cause.\nWe\u2019re hoping to raise \u00a320,000 this\nyear, and have raised as much as in the\npast.\nAll the money we collect will go directly to helping the Tanzanian people\nand personal costs \u2013 such as flights\nand accommodation \u2013 are paid for by\nthe team members themselves. Get\ninvolved with one of our four departments \u2013 Research, education, fundraising or public relations \u2013 by sending us\nan email now at raincatcher@impe-rial.ac.uk.\nTo find out more, or to donate money\nto us through Virgin Money Giving,\nfollow this link:\nwww.raincatcherimperial.org\nThen look no further than Imperial\u2019s Erasmus scheme\nIn March 2011, Imperial College Finance Society Conference held their\nfirst ever finance related conference at\nthe prestigious Bloomberg HQ, called\nthe New Financial Worlds Conference.\nThe conference was well anticipated\nand attracted over 200 people from a\nrange of academic backgrounds. Ultimately, last year\u2019s focus audience were\nmembers within the finance society\nalong with members from other leading universities. After a rigorous selection process, candidates who attended\nthe conference were able to enjoy presentations of the highest quality associated with financial markets.\nThe idea behind the conference was\nto provide the audience with an over-Brave New Financial World\nDerivatives are on the menu at Finance Society conference, held at Bloomberg HQ\nall understanding towards determining\nhow psychology has affected the markets in ever changing market conditions\nwhilst providing a broader understanding towards the mechanisms associated\nwithin the certain markets and asset\nclasses such as Commodities, Equities and Fixed Income. The impressive\nspeakers list devoted to delivering such\npresentations included executives from\nleading investment banks along with\ninternationally recognised academics\nand leading market specialists. Beyond\nthis, there were exciting panel discussions and interactive workshops which\ngained tremendous feedback. Members\nwho attended the conference also had\nthe opportunity to network with a range\nof top industry experts out of a typical\nrecruitment atmosphere encompassed\nat standard company presentations on\ncampus, enabling more ideas about the\nmarkets to be discussed in detail.\nLast years\u2019 undoubted success means\nthat we can now aim to compete with\nother leading London universities to\nproduce and deliver a conference that\nwill add value to the entire city. After\na huge thought process and many meetings between large numbers of people\nassociated with the Imperial College\nFinance Society, it became apparent\nthat we had to develop a unique selling point which has been overlooked by\nother universities.\nExclusively, the theme for future conferences held by the Imperial College\nFinance Society will be Derivatives\nwith a specialisation each year. The\nDerivatives market in the last decade in\nparticular has ignited some of the most\nextraordinary events in financial history across the globe, most notably the\nfinancial crisis witnessed a few years\nago. Since the development of such\ntools within the financial sector, investors can use Derivatives to obtain exposure to certain asset classes, mitigate\nrisk and speculate on the markets. There\nis a variety of underlying asset classes\nto which the overall Derivatives market\noperates on i.e. Foreign Exchange, Equity, Commodity and Interest Rate Derivatives. It is our aim for this years\u2019\nconference under the new name of New\nFinancial Worlds \u2013 Derivatives Conference to provide the audience with a\ngreater understanding of more complex\nissues surrounding Derivatives whilst\nincreasing the awareness. We believe\nInderjit Birdee this can be accomplished by having a\nrange of presentations dedicated towards such products, their mechanisms\nof use, and their implications within the\nmarkets.\nIn particular, the specialisation for\nthis year\u2019s conference will be Credit\nDerivatives, i.e. Credit valuation Adjustment (CVA), counterparty credit\nrisk and risk management. Counterparty credit risk is crucial when determining the fair value of any derivative\nportfolio. In past years, it was common\nto mark derivative portfolios to market\nwithout considering the counterparty\nrisk associated. However as a consequence of a number of high profile defaults in 2008, there has been a growing interest towards CVA, as this can be\nconsidered as the difference between\n\n"

    "content": "I\nn Prague, New Year\u2019s Eve (or\nSilvestr as the Czech would\nsay) is a major celebratory\nholiday. With three days to\nexperience Prague and see in\n2012, my main concern was that I\u2019d\nbecome one of the many that are inevitably frustrated by, or caught in,\nthe tourist trap that Prague is famed\nfor being. However, in a city that is\nover-run with visitors 365 days of the\nyear, this is difficult to avoid \u2013 particularly over the New Year period. In the\nfinal couple of days leading up to the\ncountdown, Prague is extraordinarily\nanimated with an air of anticipation\nsettling over the city.\ncoffeehouse doubles as an Englishlanguage book shop. Caf\u00e9 Slavia is\nanother famous watering hole, and this\none holds the distinguished claim of\nbeing the oldest caf\u00e9 in Prague. Due to\nits proximity to the National Theatre,\none can usually spot a D-list Czech celebrity or two sipping on their cappuci-nos here. Indeed, it was a favourite of\nKafka\u2019s himself.\nPublic transport in Prague is cheap,\nbut unnecessary for anyone halfway fit\nand mobile; the real beauty of Prague\nis in its architecture \u2013 something best\nseen on foot. The city\u2019s legacy of buildings and landmarks manage to touch\non almost every architectural style of\nthe last thousand years from gothic,\nthrough baroque to cubism. Old Town\nSquare seems to be home to buildings\nspanning all of these styles, from the\nreknowned Astronomical Clock to St.\nNicholas\u2019 Church.\nFancy a stroll across Charles Bridge?\nNo problem \u2013 as long as you don\u2019t\nmind a view of the backs of hundreds\nof people (especially if you\u2019re as vertically challenged as myself) for the\nentirety of the half an hour it will take\nto crawl across the bridge. There is no\ntime of year that Prague doesn\u2019t draw\nthousands of tourists, artists, entertain-ers, and vendors to grace its arguably\nmost famous landmark. So when to\ntake full advantage of the breathtaking\nviews of Prague\u2019s landscape offered\nfrom the vantage point of Charles\nBridge? For those of you willing to\nmake the effort, waking up before\ndawn ought to guarantee you\u2019ll have to\nshare the bridge with only a very small\nnumber of other keen tourists. For lazier travellers more akin to myself, late\nevening (although not on New Year\u2019s\nEve!) makes for just a slightly busier\nbut more romantic picture of Prague\nCastle, lit up stunningly and looking\nnot unlike a Walt Disney creation.\nAt the northern end of Charles\nBridge is a stairway leading down\nto Kampa Island, which is the site of\nPrague\u2019s contemporary art museum. It\nis also home to many small pubs and\neateries selling authentic Czech food\nand beer. Whilst spending my first\nafternoon wandering around the is-land, I accidentally stumbled upon a\n\u2018lovelock bridge\u2019 \u2013 a phenomenon that\nis fast becoming popular in Europe.\nFor anyone else as fascinated by these\nuniversal declarations of love as I am,\nthis one is found very near to the John\nLennon wall on Kampa Island \u2013 something else worth a visit.\nPrague Castle itself is where I was at\nthe start of the New Year \u2013 and I don\u2019t\nbelieve there was a better place for it.\nFirework displays, all beautifully syn-chronised, could be seen right across\nthe city from Charles Bridge below to\nPetrin Hill above. The backdrop of the\ncastle lent the night a magical touch,\nand the atmosphere among the assembled revellers was relaxed and fun.\nWalking back to our hotel post-fes-tivities led us through the city\u2019s other\nmajor gathering points on New Year\u2019s\nEve. Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square were evidently the livelier\nplaces to see in midnight \u2013 even with\nchampagne bottles smashing and fireworks going off mere inches from our\nfaces, we were only catching the tail-end of Prague\u2019s most raucous celebra-tions.\nThe morning after, the clean-up operation starts early; but for the odd few\nstacks of bottles and cans haphazardly\nleft on street corners, by midday the\ncity looks just as it would any other\nday of the year. Most businesses begin\ntrading at their usual hours. The first\nday of a new year is a slow one, but\none sight worth getting a head start on\nother eager tourists for is Petrin Hill.\nThe arduous hike (okay, slight abuse\nof artistic license there) to the summit\nof this hill, which stands at 1043 feet\ntall, is accordingly rewarded by the\npanoramic views of Prague from the\ntop. One\u2019s final moments in Prague are\nwell spent just quietly observing from\nhere, and reflecting on the year that has\npassed, and the year to come.\n\u201c...Prague Castle,\nlit up stunningly\nand looking not\nunlike a Walt Disney\ncreation...\u201d\nPicture-perfect Prague\nDushi Arumuganesan sees in the New Year in the buzzing Czech capital\nAn \u2018independent\u2019 NYE firework display at the gates of Prague Castle\nThe view of Prague from Petrin Hill\nOne of a few hidden European lovelock bridges \u2013 on Kampa Island\nThe best way to see Prague and soak\nin the ambience is to walk the entire\ncity, spending a day on each side of\nthe river Vltava, breaking each day\nup with stops at any of Prague\u2019s abundant caf\u00e9s and coffeehouses to people-watch. In fact, you could blow almost\nall of your holiday budget on coffee\nand still see most of Prague worth see-ing. The caf\u00e9s in Prague are definitely\nworth dedicating some time to.

    "content": "Fassbender just can\u2019t get enough\nFor Brandon (Fassbender), sex is\nwhat starts and ends his day. He\nwakes up, walks into the shower and\nmasturbates. At night, the internet\ngives him access to all sorts of por-nography. That\u2019s not all. He often\nenjoys the company of prostitutes,\none night stands, and even more masturbation in the men\u2019s room of his\nworkplace. On the outside, he\u2019s your\naverage good-looking advertising\nexecutive. Brandon probably knows\nthat he\u2019s a sex addict. He would never\nadmit it, but you can see the pain of\na tortured man in his face whenever\nhe tries to satisfy his constant sexual\ncraving that is slowly eating away at\nhim. He is forever tormented \u2013 and\nsex provides that brief moment of relief and satisfaction. This doesn\u2019t last\nlong of course, but this will have to\ndo. And as a single man living alone\nin his apartment, Brandon seems to be\nin control of his life.\nThis is until the sudden appearance\nof his younger, troubled sister, Sissy\n(Mulligan). He is not pleased with\nthis unannounced visitation, but being\nhis own sister, tries to take care of her.\nBut it turns out Sissy is just as damaged as Brandon. Whereas Brandon\ntends to actively seek out a way to\nfind satisfaction, Sissy is more helpless and relies on others for comfort\nand company. Her low self-esteem\nand self-destructive behaviour make\nher emotionally vulnerable. Hooking up with Brandon\u2019s married boss\n(the excellent James Badge Dale),\non Brandon\u2019s own bed no less, never\ncleaning up after herself, the carefully\norganised New York apartment life\nthat Brandon is so used to and needs\nstarts to fall apart as the unstable Sissy crashes head-on into his life.\nWhat made these characters who\nthey are is not the focus for McQueen. A slight hint only suggests\ntheir troubled childhood and other\nEnglish actress. During this memorable scene, McQueen shifts his camera\nfrom Sissy to Brandon, showing our\nprotagonist suppress his emotions. He\ndoes have a soft spot for his uninhibited wreck of a sister, but still has no\nchoice but to put his needs first.\nMuch like his actors, McQueen remains brave throughout the film, and\nis never afraid to look away even in\nthe most exposed, uncomfortable\nscenes. His long takes will no doubt\nfrustrate some viewers, but Shame\nis not supposed to be an easy watch.\nThe explicit nudity is necessary to immediately set the tone and McQueen\ndoesn\u2019t beat around the bush introducing the central character. We are\nsupposed take Brandon for what he is,\nbut it\u2019s hard not to wonder just what it\nwas that plunged him into the world\nof sex addiction. What happens in the\nfew days of their lives we do get to\nsee is no doubt a gripping one, but\nyou may not leave the cinema feeling\nfully invested in its characters. But\nwhat Shame is proud to boast, its top-notch performances and perceptive\ndirection are well worth your while.\nthan that, the audience has to fill the\ngaps. What Shame does so brilliantly\nhowever, is the careful examination\nof its extremely complex characters.\nBrandon\u2019s world, for what it\u2019s worth,\nis a meticulously structured one, and\nthis is shown through the neatly designed sets that surround him. It\u2019s almost too clean, to the point that it suggests Brandon cannot afford the time\nor desire to decorate. His mind is on\none thing only.\nIt\u2019s what Fassbender\u2019s remarkable\nperformance shows that is truly fas-cinating; the inner Brandon, the side\nof him he never shows to anyone. His\ncolleagues don\u2019t suspect a thing, and\ninitially, his sister doesn\u2019t quite know.\nFassbender is an intense, focused\npresence on screen, and his quiet,\nblank gaze is unnerving as he seduces\nwomen from afar. From his perfectly\nstill, unflinching motion, we can only\npresume there is no limit to his dark\nfantasies. McQueen\u2019s frequent use of\nclose-ups into the actor\u2019s face further\nboosts his range as the fearless actor\nfinds that delicate balance between\nsuperficial charm and disturbing hidden sexual appetite.\nBrandon even contemplates whether a normal intimate relationship is\never possible for someone like him.\nThis prompts him to approach a co-worker; something that doesn\u2019t quite\nlead to the things he was expecting.\nIt\u2019s heart-breaking to see a man so\ndistant from others \u2013 he\u2019s attracted to\nno-one and sex is merely a convenient\ngateway for orgasm, and Brandon is\nnever too fussed about how he goes\nabout this. On one night of despera-tion, he even goes to a gay bar. There\nis nothing to suggest that Brandon is\ngay, or straight for that matter. Building a deep, meaningful connection is\nnot his specialty, and this is all he\u2019s\never known.\nActing against Fassbender is the\nequally effective Mulligan, who\nshows, among other things, that\nshe can sing too. As she performs a\nstripped down version of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u2018New York, New York\u2019 in a cabaret bar, it becomes the defining moment that tells us of the pain that Sissy\nhas suffered over the years, captured\nso exceptionally well by the young\nJohn Park\nDirector Steve McQueen\nScreenwriters Steve McQueen, Abi\nMorgan\nCast Michael Fassbender, Carey\nMulligan\nShame\nNothing like having a semi-nude lie-in on a day-off (watch where that hand is going, Michael!)...\nFILM\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 29\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nAward Season Events to Look Forward to:\nProducers Guild Awards: Saturday 21 January\nDirectors Guild Awards: Saturday 28 January\nScreen Actors Guild Awards: Sunday 29 January\nBAFTA Film Awards: Sunday 12 February\nWriters Guild Awards: Sunday 19 February\nIndependent Spirit Awards: Saturday 25 February\nAcademy Awards: Sunday 26 February 2011 actor/actress winners: Christian Bale, Natalie Portman, Melissa Leo and Colin Firth\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nLogicomix is a rather unusual book \u2013 an exploration of the early development of mathematical logic, interwoven with the profound story\nof the life of one of the greatest thinkers in the\nfield \u2013 Bertrand Russell \u2013 all told in graphic\nnovel format. A tall order for any work, but\nLogicomix manages it admirably.\nWhile it does give a fascinating outline of the\nbasics of the field of logic, the main strength of\nthe book is its human focus. Russell\u2019s story is,\nwhen it comes down to it, a very simple one of\na man searching for meaning in the world and,\nas such, it is eminently relatable. The effective\npresentation of Russell\u2019s life rests in no small\npart in the fantastic framing device. I\u2019ve always found older versions of the protagonists\ntelling somebody about their lives an effective\nstorytelling device, but Logicomix goes a step\nbeyond this by having fictionalised versions of\nits creators discussing a lecture Russell gave\non the eve of World War II, in which used the\nstory of his life to explain why, despite his\npacifism, he did not object to war with Nazi\nGermany.\nThis allows Russell\u2019s early life to be analysed in a very natural way from both the point\nof view of his older self and of external ob-servers. While the writer\u2019s narration provides\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n32\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\na much needed objective view on his life,\nRussell\u2019s narration helps us get into his head\n\u2013 helping us to understand him and sympathise\nwith him. We get a real picture of a principled,\ndriven man who sacrifices so much of his personal happiness in a quest for mathematical\nAn epic quest for truth\ntruth.\nEqually well developed are Russell\u2019s col-leagues, friends and family \u2013 who add much\ndepth to the story. Of course, given that the\nbook has less than 400 pages and covers several decades of Russell\u2019s life, some changes to\nreal life characters and events are inevitable \u2013\nmost noticeable being the complete absence of\nthe protagonist\u2019s brother Frank. Most of these,\nhowever, are explained by the writers in the\nexternal framing device \u2013 meaning readers are\nnot misinformed, while allowing the story to\nfit into the limited space and maintain narrative\ncoherence.\nEqually worth mentioning is the artwork.\nSuperbly drawn by Alecos Papadatos it is\nstriking in its realistic clarity. At times amus-ing, at times moving, it always serves to support and add to the story and is one the book\u2019s\ngreatest strengths.\nLogicomix is a brilliant work. It strikes me\nas sad that there are still people who refuse\nto treat graphic novels seriously. While certain genres might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, I\nfind it remarkably immature and snobbish for\nsome people to reject an entire medium out-right. If these people gave Logicomix a chance,\nthey would quickly see that good graphic novels don\u2019t have to be about superheros or newspaper comic strip characters.\nAn unusual biography of a fascinating philosopher\nHolmes like you\u2019ve never read him before\nGiven the latest upsurge in popularity for\nSherlock Holmes, and the recent film and TV\nadaptations, I think that the time is right for a\nreview of a Holmes story in this section. I\u2019m\nnot a huge fan of Holmes but I have read all of\nthe stories SirArthur Conan Doyle wrote about\nhim. It\u2019s hardly a huge achievement \u2013 there\nare sixty of them, and only four of these are\nnovels. However, despite this small number,\nand Doyle\u2019s clear and engaging writing style,\nthe Holmes tales are very repetitive. After a\nfew dozen one inevitably becomes bored and\nstories begin to all run together. Therefore, if\nasked for my favourite work about the great\ndetective, I would have to point to the only\nstory that I have read that really stands out for\nme, a story not even written by Conan Doyle:\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s A Study in Emerald.\nGaiman\u2019s pastiche reimagines Doyle\u2019s hero\nin a Cthulu Mythos setting but, despite this\nradical change, this remains recognisable as\na Holmes story. Gaiman emulates Doyle\u2019s\nstyle perfectly and a great deal of the appeal\nof the story comes from the juxtaposition of\nthe somewhat dry, matter-of-fact narration\nand the horrifying subject matter. Just a few\nparagraphs in the narrator, reminiscing on his\nmilitary experience, calmly writes how \u201cthe\ngods and men of Afghanistan were savages,\nunwilling to be ruled from Whitehall or from\nBerlin of even from Moscow\u201d. It\u2019s also fun to\nsee how the writer imagines life would be like\nif humanity had been conquered by Eldritch\nAbominations. If you want to see Queen Victoria as a tentacled Great Old One this is the\nstory for you.\nPrior knowledge of both Doyle\u2019s stories and\nthe Mythos is helpful as Study in Emerald is\nfilled to the brink with both. Knowledge of\nConan Doyle\u2019s work in particular will allow\na careful reader to guess the solution to the\nmystery pretty early in the story, and at least\na cursory acquaintance with the stories\u2019 main\ncharacters is required to fully understand end-ing. Casual readers, however, shouldn\u2019t be\nparticularly put off, as the mystery and the deductive skills of the protagonist are more than\nenough to carry the story.\nIn short, this is a fantastic story, well deserving of its many awards. It is also available\nfree to read on Gaiman\u2019s website \u2013 beautifully\nlaid out and illustrated by Jouni Koponen to\nresemble a 19th century paper, complete with\nhumorous advertisements based on 19th century horror stories.

You are locked out\nTime for change\nNew Year Resolution? Get Coding\nof that education forever, but you exist\nin a world of increasing technological\ncomplexity, where those with knowledge\nof programming, the internet, operating\nsystems and electronics are increasingly\ndistancing themselves from those without that knowledge.\nThis distancing is more subtle in some\nplaces than others.

In reality, many of\nthe attacks carried out last year on high-profile websites were little more sophisticated than when my mother downloads\niTunes, installs it, and uses it to play\nmusic. Read a BBC news article on the\nmatter, however, and you enter a cyber-Tolkien world where hackers wield a\nmagical power that you don\u2019t, and never\ncan, understand.\nThis is wrong. This is not the attitude\nB\nack in the dear old early\n14th century, \u201cthe pox\u201d\nwas considered a punishment from God. If you\nhad it, you were evil and\nit was a just fate. You had wronged.\nYou had failed. You deserved to die.\nThe trouble with this idea was that there\ncame a time when it struck a lot of people that this was not quite true. In the\nmid and late 14th century, a lot of people died of it. At once. Whole villages\nvanished. And this happened across Europe, though sadly without BBC News\nto report it. Either way, the emphasis\nshifted a bit from individuals to groups\nof people being \u2018bad\u2019. The thinking\nwas that the older generation had got\nit a bit wrong, but it is alright, because\nwe have found out about it now. And,\nco-incidentally, all the bad people are\ndead so there is nothing more to worry\nabout. Keep praying for good harvests\nand to avoid Armageddon and it will all\nbe fine.\nAnd all was fine, until the next time.\nThat came as an influenza outbreak in\nthe 16th century that killed even Mary I.\nInfluenza, like other infectious diseases,\nwas not seen quite as a punishment from\nGod, at least not by enlightened schol-ars. Despite that, talk of it was enough\nto put the wind up the peasantry, much\nas Fox News does today. We probably\nget a balanced view from Shakespeare,\nwho seems to suggest that by this period it was understood that such an illness\ncould be spread, and thus could also\nbe contained. Containment of a sort\nwas achieved by restricting the movement of people (a plot device in Romeo\nand Juliet). Things had moved on a lot\nsince the God-fearing Christians of pre-Renaissance England had thought that\nprayer and being nice to God would absolve them from death-by-anthrax.\nWhat stepped things on from this\npoint was the discovery of the cell by\nHooke about fifty years later. A while\nafter this the bacterium was identified,\nand then not long after that the cause of\nthe likes of scarlet fever, tuberculosis\nand so on were begining to be under-stood. It was infectious disease, and a\nlot of them could be knocked out by\ntaking antibiotics. As a result we now\nenjoy a whole host of other ways to die,\nmany of which were unknown in medieval Britain, chiefly because if you\nmade it to 30 and had children you were\nhaving enough of a party not to give a\ndamn one way or the other.\nThis is not the whole story though.\nPeople in the dark ages were put to\ndeath for things we would term illness-es, or at least, long-term medical condi-tions. People who had Tourette\u2019s syndrome were considered to be possessed\nby demons. People with manic depression or paranoid schizophrenia were\nthought of either as ludicrously spiritual\nand were revered, or just mad and were\nburned. Sadly, none of these things has\nthe benefit of being caused by a plentiful life-form that can be observed under\na microscope. It is \u2018psychological\u2019, and\nunless you know someone who is like\nthat, it is an alien and often uncomfortable world for to encounter. A world as\nterrifying as the one where coughs and\nsneezes meant you were an emissary of\nto technology that should be spread. The\nworld is becoming increasingly reliant\non software and hardware, and we are\nencouraging the population to shy away\nfrom understanding it, rather than embracing it and learning to bend it to their\nown ends. The average Imperial student \u2013 intelligent, motivated and already\nworking closely within the world of science \u2013 is perfectly positioned to pick up\nand learn how to program, how websites\nwork, how data is stored, how adverts target users of certain websites, how bittorrent users can be identified and how the\nworld around them works. Once people\nsuch as yourselves have embraced this, it\nwill make it easier to pass the knowledge\nA representation of how you look to others when you are a knowledgable\ncomputing lecturer\nThe average\nImperial student\n... is perfectly\npositioned to pick\nup and learn how\nto program\n\u201d\nn how\nn how\n\u201c\nThe ave\nThe ave\nImperia\nImperia\non to others, and turn around the trend of\navoiding technological complexity.\nAnd so to the nub of my article. I\u2019m\nnot one for resolutions generally, but this\nyear I implore every one of you to learn\nsomething new about the technology that\nyou use every day. If you wish to learn\nhow to program, the website CodeYear\ncan help you with regular lectures, resources and assistance. Imperial\u2019s Robotics, Gaming, Wikipedia, and other\ntech-related societies are welcoming and\nwell-informed. As any computer scientist can attest, you cannot know enough\nabout technology. But the more you\nknow, the better-equipped you\u2019ll be for\nthe future.\nSatan, I have no doubt.\nNeedless to say, I do think it is \u2018Time\nfor a Change\u2019. Treating illness with suspicion and neglect is as bonkers as many\nof those who are neglected for that rea-son. What I am nervous of, however, is\nwhingeing and moaning as a means to\nincreasing awareness. Complaining that\nchange is required puts \u2018mental health\nissues\u2019in the same bracket as every other good cause, not least the most nauseating of all, the \u2018needy\u2019.\nSo what am I, and my fellow mental-ists, to do? Well, we need to play a long\ngame. This is for the same reason that\ngoing to the Middle Ages and telling\npeople the real reasons why they had\nsyphilis would not work. People need\nto be educated at a pace at which they\ncan learn. In order for that to work,\nall of us need to learn. We need to\nlearn what causes people to be manic-depressive, or depressive, or whatever.\nThat means spending money on science\n(obviously), but it also means talking\nabout it, and it means changing.

Cave\nJohnson here.\nAs founder and CEO of Aperture Science, I\u2019ve been invited by Felix to write about\nthe glamorous lifestyle that awaits you all as\nattractive, well-paid and influential scientists.\nConsidering the fact that most of you will end\nup working as drones for money-grabbing\nsuits in the city, who wouldn\u2019t know the thrill\nof scientific endeavour if a time-travelling\nEinstein told them the secret of eternal life,\nthis should be quite a short article.\nInstead, I want to talk to you about the rat-race that is scientific progress, and why we\nneed as many able-bodied scientists as possi-ble. Last week, I gave the boys down in the lab\na bunch of contracts to sign, allowing us to use\ntheir bodies for some reanimation tests. All I\ngot back was some speech about their human\nrights, but what about your rights? Don\u2019t you\nand your children have a right to a better life if\nthese tests prove that a concentrated solution\nof kitten tears is able to repair dead cells?\nAs a result, my lawyer keeps calling me,\nsaying that I shouldn\u2019t be slowly filling their\nlab with water, but what does he know \u2014 he\neven says I shouldn\u2019t be admitting this to you.\nHe\u2019s not like you and me. He\u2019s not a scientist.\nWhat good are all the letters at the end of\nyour name if you can\u2019t even escape from a\nroom slowly filling with water? This is survival of the brightest in action, and we\u2019ll have\nmore subjects for testing this way. If they\ndidn\u2019t say no, it\u2019s implied consent.\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get\nto where I am today without the boys in the\nlab, and they could not have a more satisfying job. Where else can the outcome of testing the theory behind Schrodinger\u2019s cat result\nin a horde of un-killable kittens (which was\ncoincidentally the start of our reanimation\ntests)? Certainly not Black Mesa, I can tell\nyou! My contacts tell me that Black Mesa is\nlike kindergarten \u2014 lots of crayons and people who steal your ideas. Seriously now, don\u2019t\ngo there. Please.\nTo contribute to science, you don\u2019t have\nto sign your life away, or even the rights to\nyour body parts. Even if you just participate\nin some tests with us at Aperture, someone\nsomewhere will thank you for your contribution to science. But not me \u2014 I only thank\nthose who are married to science. Don\u2019t you\nwant to be able to say that you helped dissect\nthe science behind cuteness, or developed the\ncure to stupidity?\nWell, just as a heads up, I\u2019ve been in conGo get your hustle on. For\nscience\ntact with the college and the kitchen staff, and\nwe\u2019ve settled on a deal. As students, we know\nhow much you love free things, so we\u2019re going\nto be giving you all some vouchers to use in\nyour JCR, and over the next few weeks we\u2019re\ngoing to be adding a bunch of chemicals to the\nfood that you eat on campus. I can\u2019t even pronounce half of the stuff we\u2019re pouring into the\ncoffee alone, so this is groundbreaking stuff.\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 the boys in the lab were pretty\nsure that what you will be eating and drinking\nisn\u2019t toxic. That\u2019s why you\u2019re doing the tests\nto check. There may be some minor side ef-fects, such as an urge to procrastinate, or not\nget any work done, but it shouldn\u2019t be too se-rious. You get free food and can contribute to\nscience, so it\u2019s smiles all around!\nIf you also experience the development of\nsuperpowers, spontaneous combustion or are\nabducted by aliens, then that\u2019s probably not\nus, but something to tell your grandkids! Let\nus know anyway.\nOn the other hand, if you become hard of\nhearing, start coughing up blood, or develop\na case of death, you probably ate some of the\nfood intended for the staff. That\u2019s not a problem \u2013 just let a test associate know, and we\u2019ll\nfix you up, good and proper.

    "content": "In Brief\nImperial collects lowest amount\nof university library fines\nImperial College London are bottom of a league\ntable. Luckily, this is a list of the amount of money\nraised from library fines. Only \u00a326,703 was collected in fines in the period between the 2005/2006\nacademic year and now. As all students know,\nif you don\u2019t pay your fines, you aren\u2019t allowed to\nuse the library. It\u2019s hard to speculate, but maybe\nthe thought of being barred from the library is so\nunnerving that Imperial students promptly return\ntheir books.\nOn hearing the news, Jason Parmar, Deputy\nPresident (Education) stated that Imperial \u201cprides\nitself on its world class library facilities and learning resources\u201d.\nThe highest London based university was King\u2019s\nin fourth place, who, no doubt, found it confusing\nto be so high up on a table. In at number one was\nLeeds, managing to collect \u00a31,869,340 in fines\nover the course of six academic years. As this is\nLeeds, the term academic is used lightly. The previous statement could be seen to be unfair; the\namount raised could suggest that Leeds\u2019 students\nlove their subjects so much that they can\u2019t bear\nto give their books back, or that they\u2019re just lazy\nand forget.\nAfter looking at the table Parmar went on to say:\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the contributing factors to why we are\nso much better than UCL and are higher than them\nin the rankings \u2013 lol, PAR\u201d. He refused to comment\non the social acceptability of using the word \u201clol\u201d\nin conversation.\nDeborah Shorley, Director of Library Services,\ncalled Imperial\u2019s position at the bottom of the table as a \u201cgreat victory\u201d and that \u201cit is a very good\nreflection on the Imperial student\u201d as they are \u201cso\nwell behaved\u201d. She stressed that Imperial only imposes fines to make sure the books circulate and\nthat it was not a way of generating money.\nTeam Leader for User Services Angus Brown\nadded, \u201cWe only charge fines on the late return of\nreserved and high demand books, and otherwise\nencourage students to renew items they continue\nto need. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to compare libraries (and universities) across the sector, but I think\nit\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re quietly pleased to be bottom\nof this particular league.\u201d\nTim Arbabzadah\nNEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n4\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nSupport for Clayponds\ndifferent demographic\u201d in terms of accommodation costs.\n\u201cIf Clayponds is closed, replacing it will be impossible,\u201d he contin-ued. \u201cFinding a self contained site with\n136 properties of flats and houses in\nzone 3 with good transport links via the\nPiccadilly Line straight into college is\nunrealistic. Converting those properties\ninto student accommodation, including\ncommon room facilities and offices for\nhall supervisors would also be expen-sive. Clayponds provides for some of\nyour poorer postgraduate students the\naccommodation they need, just as it has\nbeen doing for around 20 years.\u201d\nThe Rector\u2019s response aimed to provide some background to the College\u2019s\ndecisions, beginning with a reassurance\nthat \u201cwe care very much that safe and\naffordable accommodation is provided\nfor students whilst they study at College.\u201d\nThe response details that a focus\ngroup was held in February 2011,\n\u201cwhich returned a clear message that\nstudents wanted the College to provide\naccommodation in areas within 30 minutes travel time to the South Kensington\ncampus and close to public transport for\nincreased security, particularly in the\nevenings.\u201d\n\u201cPostgraduate students stressed that,\nunlike when they were undergraduates\nliving away from home for the first time,\nthey wanted an independent living experience but with opportunities to socialise\nas they wish. The College developed its\npostgraduate accommodation strategy\nwith this feedback as a key focus.\u201d\nIn addition, the Rector raised concerns about the suitability of Clayponds in the long term, citing an \u201cover 50\nminute travel time to South Kensington,\nin an area with little to offer students in\ntheir leisure time.\u201d\n\u201cThrough selling Clayponds the College will be able to raise in the order of\n\u00a325m-\u00a330m. This will be reinvested in\nthe provision of bursaries to all Imperial\npostgraduates students that choose to\nlive in GradPad accommodation [Grif-nior management has really annoyed\nme. Clayponds is an Imperial institution\nwell-loved by its current and former res-idents, many of whom return to visit. A\nrationale adequate for closing such a\nsuccessful part of the College needs to\nbe quite spectacular, and yet it has not\nbeen forthcoming.\u201d\nUnion President Scott Heath has actively stated his concern with the clo-sure, claiming that the \u201cconsultation\n[the Union] had [with College] was\nabsolutely zero\u201d. Expressing his \u201cdisappointment\u201d with the lack of contact with\nCollege, especially in light of the \u201cdirect\nimpact\u201d that such an event would have\non the student body, he continued: \u201cthe\none-year bursary scheme is a clear sign\nthat College recognises that Grad Pad is\npricing out a large number of students.\nUnfortunately this level of bursary is not\nenough to \u2018price in\u2019 students.\u201d\n\u201cWe currently have no fit for purpose\npostgraduate accommodation if you\nwant to replicate what Clayponds of-fers. Maybe a few years down the line\nwe will have postgraduate accommodation that has the same community spirit,\nbut until then College must provide low-cost accommodation if they have any\ncare or consideration about making life\naffordable (comfortable).\u201d\n\u201cThis whole situation is reminiscent\nof last year\u2019s Life Sciences restructure\nand a sign that the Union needs to have\nthe chance to consult Management\nBoard papers.\u201d\nThe College\u2019s Management Board,\nwhich is chaired by the Rector, is delegated authority to approve projects with\na total value of less than \u00a35m. Hence,\nthe selling of Clayponds, which could\ngenerate over \u00a325m, must also be approved by the College Council. Imperial\nCollege Union, while not sitting on the\nManagement Board, do sit on College\nCouncil, who will meet on 10 February. Heath indicated that he will \u201cuse the\nposition in Council to voice the opinion\nof the Student Body and apologise to all\nmembers that neglect of Management\nBoard to consult us means that such\ncomments must be aired there.\u201d\nfon Studios in Clapham or Imperial\nWest at Wood Lane]; the bursary will be\nin the region of \u00a325 per week for postgraduates in 2012-13. This subsidy will\nenable Imperial\u2019s students to live in better quality accommodation, much closer\nto South Kensington, than Clayponds\ncurrently offers.\u201d\nPast and present residents of Clayponds have contacted Felix in response to\nthese statements.\nLauren Clark was a resident at Clayponds for one year, until September\n2011, and believes that the loss of the\naccommodation there would \u201cgreatly\ndetract from the experience of future\npostgraduate students\u201d. Writing that\n\u201cthe availability of affordable student\nhousing was instrumental in making\nmy time at Imperial enjoyable,\u201d reference is also made to the estate\u2019s social\nside: \u201cClayponds Village also provided\na great community atmosphere and culture that can not be easily recreated.\u201d\nIn response to the longer commute and\nactivities, she continues: \u201cwhile the\ncommute time is something I did gripe\nabout, I\u2019d have to strenuously disagree\nabout the surrounding area having little\nto offer. Kew Gardens and Richmond\nare a single bus ride away\nS\u00e9verine Mar\u00e9chal, writing in an\nopen letter, also emphasises the community of the site, or \u201cClayponds identity\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cthe dynamism and enthusiasm of the\nwardens and staff\u2026 fostered by numerous activities and a constant on-duty\npresence.\u201d Also highlighting the afford-ability of the location in comparison to\nGriffon Studios, she continues: \u201cPersonally I would not have been able to join\nImperial, would I not have had this accommodation option\u201d.\nJohn Castle, resident at Clayponds for\nthe 2010-2011 academic year, recalls an\n\u201camazing year\u201d, again highlighting the\n\u201csuperb community feel\u201d.

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 31\nThe Problem of Piracy\nOnline piracy is a growing problem, but planned, potentially disastrous US legislation is not the way to tackle it. Laurence Pope discusses\nS\nome readers may well be familiar\nwith the acronyms SOPA and PIPA,\nboth of which have been bounded\nabout in the news over the last few\nmonths or so. They stand for the Stop\nOnline Piracy Act and the closely related Protect\nIP (Intellectual Property) Act. Both are bills that\nare currently being considered, respectively, by\nthe US House of Representatives and the Senate. As their names suggest, they are aimed at\ncombating online piracy. The issues surrounding\nthese proposed laws are both numerous and complicated in nature, as are the arguments wielded\nby its supporters and critics; if you\u2019re spurned\ninto action by this piece then there\u2019s a wealth of\ninformation that can be found in the very medium the bills will impact \u2013 namely, the internet.\nAt the time of writing, SOPA has lost most of\nits momentum following a statement from the\nWhite House claiming that, whilst internet piracy needs to be curbed, \u201cwe will not support\nlegislation that reduces freedom of expression,\nincreases cybersecurity risk, or undermines\nthe dynamic, innovative global Internet.\u201d This,\nalong with the hugely negative response from internet giants such as Google, Twitter and Wikipedia, has effectively clipped SOPA\u2019s wings.\nThat is not the end of the story however. PIPA\nstill exists, and there is nothing to say that modifications of SOPA will lead to it being passed\nsilently by Congress. This is not an issue to be\nignored.\nBut why are these bills so dangerous? Why did\nthey prompt Wikipedia, Reddit and other sites to\nco-ordinate a shut down on January 18? Surely\nthey only aim to combat piracy that is, at the end\nof the day, an illegal activity. There are laws at\nthe moment, such as the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which protects copyrighted\nmaterial, but SOPA and PIPA would target sites\nhosting the material. It would allow the US Justice Department to target overseas sites committing or facilitating piracy, as well as force US\ninternet companies to cut ties with said websites\nand block them from searches. Theoretically this\ncould target and shut down sites with a single\nlink to any site deemed to be violating said laws.\nThis could potentially affect large sites such as\nYouTube and Facebook.\nThe ambiguous wording of the bills and their\nworryingly broad nature has come under fire,\nand a major worry is that large corporations will\nhave the power to sue smaller start-up companies\nwhom they believe aren\u2019t filtering their searches\nwell enough, start-up companies who could have\ngone on to be the next Facebook. Entertainment\ncompanies already have the power to take down\ncopyrighted material. The major concern is that a\nprecedent will be set-up, leading to the empowerment of the entertainment industry online and\nincreased censorship.\nSo what do SOPA and PIPA have to do with\ngaming? Quite a lot as it happens. Many game\nand tech companies, who you would initially assume to support the bill, have spoken out against\nit. Mojang, creators of Minecraft, underwent a\nsite blackout on the 18th in protest, and NVIDIA\nblogged that \u201c\u2026we oppose piracy \u2026 However,\nwe do not support SOPA. We don\u2019t believe it is\nthe right solution to the problem.\u201d Other companies echo this sentiment.\nThe question remains however: if piracy is\nsomething to be combated, but SOPA and PIPA\nare too Draconian, then what is the solution? The\nanswer does not lie in sweeping, misguided leg-islation. The internet is full of very intelligent\npeople, and blocks, takedowns or other anti-pi-racy measures can be easily navigated around.\nInformation spreads quickly; soon enough, any\nmeasure enacted will be counteracted and the\nbattle will begin anew. Legislation, certainly\npoorly worded and such broad legislation as\nSOPA or PIPA, is akin to applying a bandage to\nan axe wound.\nDRM (Digital Rights Management) is often\nused by media distribution companies such as\ngame publishers to protect their property from\nbeing pirated. Put simply, DRM is an umbrella\nterm applied to any technique that stops films,\nmusic and games from being copied (or \u2018ripped\u2019)\nand distributed freely. The problem is that it\u2019s\nnot all that effective at what it\u2019s supposed to do.\nAs mentioned previously people are clever.\nPirates have found, and will continue to find\nways around DRM restrictions, forcing companies to continually upgrade their protection if\nthey want to stay ahead of the game. \u2018Cracking\u2019\nDRM protection costs time \u2013 updating it costs\nboth time and money and forces companies into\na battle that they cannot possibly win. Another\nissue with DRM lies with format and standard\nchanges. DRM-restricted content is not always\nperfect, and often content that the owner has paid\nfor is lost in the changeover. It\u2019s just not a good\nanti-piracy system, as proved by the now infamous game Spore.\nSpore, a single player God-game, was released\nin 2008 by EA Games. The game featured an\noverly Draconian DRM system, requiring internet activation and a limit of only three installa-tions. Any more than that and you had to contact\nEA for an added activation, which they were not\nobliged to grant you. The result? Hilariously,\nwith over half a million downloads across various BitTorrent sites, Spore became one the most\npirated game in history. As if to rub salt on the\nwound Spore also became one of the lowest rated\ngames on Amazon, mostly down to its DRM sys-tem. If there\u2019s ever a case for aggressive DRM\nfailing to do its job, Spore is the one.\nOne solution to piracy comes from Gabe Newell, cofounder and CEO of Valve, the company\nresponsible for the digital distribution platform\nSteam. Newell claims that piracy is predominantly \u201ca service problem and not a pricing\nproblem,\u201d and has to be combated by providing\na better service than the pirates. A pirate, who\ncan provide a copy of a game 24/7, globally\nand digitally, is going to be taken up on his offer far more often than a company who requires\nyou only buy it from a store, three months after its main-region release. By providing such a\nwell thought-out service such as Steam, giving\nusers access to regular updates, chat functions\nand achievements amongst other features, Valve\nhas reached the point where piracy is \u201cbasically\na non-issue.\u201d Regular readers may have noticed\nmy slight bias towards Valve in the past. This\nbias is not without good reason.\n\u201cSpore, shipped with\naggressive anti-piracy\nprotection, became one of\nthe most pirated games in\nhistory.\u201d\n\u201cParadoxically, the answer\nto piracy lies in doing away\nwith anti-piracy protection.\u201d\nThe answer to piracy lies in doing away with\nDRM, not passing bills like SOPA or PIPA. To\nsome this may seem counter-intuitive, but as the\nSpore study shows DRM alienates many players\nand causes them to turn to piracy; it\u2019s the online equivalent of flipping the bird. People lose\nrespect for companies that support DRM, and\ncrack their protection and distribute it simply\nbecause they can. \u201cSo what?\u201d the line of arguing\noften goes, \u201cThey\u2019re big companies, they make\ntoo much money anyway.\u201d Enter the Steam service model. Valve is just as big as many of its\ncompetitors, yet commands more respect than\nmost. The result is that their games are pirated\nfar less frequently, and Steam continually rakes\nin massive profits and millions of players.\nIn a digital age companies need to focus on\ngood customer service to keep existing customers and turn around pirates. Services like Steam\nand Netflix already operate in this manner, and\nmoves by Apple to start relaxing its DRM protected music on iTunes are a good way forward.\nAt the end of the day piracy will always exist no\nmatter what you do, but it can be curbed in a way\nthat benefits everyone.\nAs for SOPA and PIPA? They\u2019re complicated\nbills, and this article can only hope to spark up\nyour interest in them. Educate yourself, and tell\nothers.\nCurrently PIPA is planned to undergo a procedural vote in the Senate on January 24. One can\nonly hope that it does not pass.\nThe failure of Spore\u2019s anti-piracy protection\ndoes little to back up the case for increased\nusage of DRM technology\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 20 january 2012 15\nCOMMENT\nFELIX 13\n\u201d\nR\nevolution! With its impassioned rhetoric and gritty\nanger the Occupy movement is intent on overhauling democracy as\nwe know it. Bitter, disaffected people\naround the world are answering Occupy\u2019s call, and governments are beginning to pay attention to the voice of\nthe disillusioned masses!\nReading preachy propagandistic\nnon-journalism like the above paragraph makes me crush my glass of\nwhisky in disgust and want to go on\nhunger strike until critical thinking\nlessons are given to all children of all\nages until they\u2019re so sceptical they end\nup believing nothing at all.\nYet this is what we have to deal with:\na right-wing press that unilaterally\ndismisses anything remotely Occupyrelated with allegations of drug abuse,\ndefecation on Church property, and\ngeneral rowdiness. In addition, we\nhave a much smaller left-wing press\nthat prints youthful, idealistic tripe and\nworships at the feet of Occupy as if it\nthe best thing to have happened to socialism since the welfare state was first\nconceived.\nThis pseudo-debate is like listening\nto two people debating over an orange:\none thinks it exhibits behaviour typical\nof a banana while the other believes it\nis a wonderful example of an apple.\nBoth sides are talking out of their el-bows, and it bores me senseless.\nI will not waste many valuable\nwords explaining what is wrong with\nthe conservative side of the \u2018debate\u2019.\nThere can be few people in Britain\ntoday who don\u2019t think the right-wing\npress is the two-faced mistress of the\nupper classes, a Conservative propaganda machine with a thinly-veiled\nsprinkling of islamophobia.\nStephen Smith\nWhy you should give me your money\nOccupy the New Year, but grow up first\nThe left-wing press is usually slightly more subtle and discerning in its\nopinions, but with Occupy it comes\nacross as a schoolboy with a crush: the\nOccupy movement can do no wrong.\nPhotos of Guy Fawkes masks accompany the anticipation of an approaching revolution. The Government must\nlisten to the voice of its people! We are\nthe 99%!\nLeaving aside the dubious statistical\nnature of \u201cthe 99%\u201d, what I really want\nto address is the idea of revolution. To\nyoung idealists like myself and the\nmembers of Occupy, revolution can\nseem exciting and liberating: who\nhasn\u2019t imagined themselves as a British Che Guevara, motorcycling down\nthe streets of a burnt-out London, cigarette in mouth, awaiting the symbolic,\nV-for-Vendetta-style explosion of Big\nBen?\nBut has it really come to this? Do\nwe really need a masked vaudevillian\nveteran or an angry Venezuelan medical student to save us from our authoritarian overlords? Of course not. The\nfact that I can write here that \u2018David\nCameron feasts daily on the bloodied\ncorpses of children\u2019 without getting\narrested is proof of that (though if I\nmysteriously stop writing articles after this, you\u2019ll know that Britain has in\nfact slipped into a North Korean night-mare).\nOccupy is about bringing back democracy and returning complete control of the government to the people\nwho elect them. And whatever revolution is, it is not democratic \u2013 it is,\nin fact, fairly totalitarian, since it involves forcing a single ideology on an\nentire population. This is fine in Egypt\nor Libya where the situation is beyond\nhorrific, but not here.\nI think I\u2019m justified in saying that\nI\n\u2019m going to lay my cards out\non the table straight away. I\nwill spend the next six months\nbegging you for money. This\nis the raison d\u2019etre of this col-umn. Amusing you (or more likely\nmyself) would be a nice perk on the\nside \u2013 a bit like dental insurance.\nGiven that you are all, no doubt,\nvery lovely, very deep pocketed people with enormously generous student\nloans, I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re already\nreaching for your cheque books. It\nonly seems fair, therefore, that I justify you handing me large wads of cash.\nSo here it is: I\u2019m taking part in an\nIronman triathlon. The iron distance\nis a 2.4 mile swim followed by a 112\nmile cycle followed by a 26.2 mile\nrun (a marathon). Now I was never\nin the \u2018gifted athlete\u2019 bracket growing\nup, but then again I was never the last\nto be picked when choosing football\nteams either. I have mid-table mediocrity written all over me. I\u2019m the\nMiddlesbrough of sporting prowess.\nThis is slightly unfortunate, because\neven if I were incredibly marvellous\nand could give Mo Farah a run for\nhis money, an Ironman later this year\nwould still be gooch-achingly diffi-cult.\nSo I guess this begs the question\n\u201cwhy?\u201d Well, simply put, (and this is\nwhere it gets a little heavy), my cousin suffers from Cystic Fibrosis and\nI\u2019m raising money for the CF Trust in\nthe hope that the research they fund\nwill save her life.\nCF is a recessive genetic disease. 1\nin 25 people are carriers of the gene\n(often unaware of the fact) and 1 in\n2500 suffer from the full blown ill-ness. It mainly affects the lungs \u2013 in\nlater stages it\u2019s so difficult to breathe\nthat it feels like you\u2019re sucking air\nthrough a straw. The median life expectancy is 35.\nMy cousin is waiting for a lung\ntransplant. If she gets one, it will radically change her life for the better, but\nmost people don\u2019t want a revolution,\nor, to phrase it less controversially, a\n\u201ccomplete overhaul of democracy\u201d.\nIt is the everyday concerns (Will the\nbuses still run? Who will pay the winter fuel allowance? Will the police still\nbe on duty? Will I still be able to fund\nmy alcoholism on the Disability Living Allowance I\u2019m fraudulently claiming from the government?) that make\nrevolution \u2013 for lack of a better phrase\n\u2013 a terrible idea.\nThe system of Government clearly\nneeds to be changed; anyone with\nhalf a brain can see that. But it is essential that it is changed from within,\nby getting elected and passing legislation through Parliament. Any other approach is hypocritical and dangerous.\nAs a new approach in this New Year,\nOccupiers and Occupy-supporters\nshould join and vote for the Green Parit won\u2019t cure her. She\u2019ll be OK for 10\nyears or so, but much more money is\nneeded for research before a permanent fix can be found.\nSo that is why I\u2019m doing an Ironman. I want to inspire people to give\na few pennies to a cause that is very\nclose to my heart. Any amount counts\n\u2013 and it will be incredibly gratefully\nreceived.\nYou can sponsor Ned online by\ngoing to www.justgiving.com/\nNedsIronman or by text through\nJustTextGiving by sending \u2018IRON66\n\u00a3(amount you like to give)\u2019 to\n70070\nOccupy is\nabsolutely right\nin its motives, but\ncompletely wrong\nin its methods\n\u201c\nOccupy\nOccupy\nabsolu\nabsolu\nty: a party with near-identical policies\nto Occupy, but with less stigma and\n\u2013 importantly \u2013 an MP in Westminster. The Green Party should debate\nstrongly with other large parties and\nrepeatedly make the point that none\nof the other 3 main parties in England\nwill make the sweeping changes that\nare needed.\nWith Lib Dem popularity at an all-time low, the Green Party should pick\nup a few more seats in the next elec-tion. Then, and only then, does Occupy\nhave the power and legitimacy to pressure the government into changing the\nsystem.\nIn short: Occupy is absolutely right\nin its motives, but completely wrong\nin its methods. The left-wing press\nshould take heed of this \u2013 a schoolboy\ncrush is a cruel thing, and it will only\nend in tears.\nCan you first figure out how to use an apostrophe please\nEdward Yoxall\n\n"

    "content": "It is odd to think that around the time of my\nbirth, some 20 years ago, Jefferson Hack and\nJohn \u2018Rankin\u2019 Waddell were on the brink of\nproducing the first issue of what was to become one of my favourite magazines during\nmy late teens and beyond. Granted, Dazed\n& Confused started as a rather low-key black\nand white fold out poster, but it almost inevitably gained momentum and acclaim, with\nRankin\u2019s prolific photography and Hack\u2019s\nkeen eye for talent, making it one of the\nleading creative publications in the world. It\nis not least because of this that as I crossed\nLondon to view a showcase of the Dazed\nstory, my expectations were set exceedingly\nhigh.\nThe exhibition itself is housed in a set of\nthe more modest rooms of Somerset House,\nmaking the pieces lining the walls all the\nmore compelling to the eye as they track the\ncourse of the magazine\u2019s history. Unsurprisingly, the works were not just confined\nto the walls, with twisted rectangular beams\nstretching out from the centre of the rooms,\nthe sides of each layered with reels of editorial frames, a quirky layout befitting what is\na rather unconventional publication.\nA theme represented heavily were the\niconic portraits, celebrity and otherwise, that\nhave set Dazed apart from most other fashion magazines, not least through Hack\u2019s incredible eye for rising talent and alternative\nbeauty. The corridor connecting the various\nspaces payed homage to all of Dazed\u2019s front\ncovers, allowing visitors to take a \u2018literal\u2019\nwalk down memory lane.\nHere many of today\u2019s household names\nfirst gained real exposure in the UK, gracing\nthe front cover in the early stages of their\ncareer with the faces of Bj\u00f6rk, Pharrel Williams and Eminem all lined up next to each\nother as well as Dazed favourite Kate Moss,\nwhose affinity for the magazine stretches far\nenough for her to regularly strip down in\nvarious semi-nude editorials.\nAdditional shots by heavyweights such\nas Terry Richardson and Rankin himself\nshowed an even more daring side to \u2018simple\u2019\nportraits with depictions of a ghostly Iggy\nPop and a grossly make up smeared Beth\nDitto (fully clothed I assure you), both under the serene gaze of an overblown close\nup of the late Yves Saint Laurent, once again\nhighlighting the different art forms Dazed\nhas covered from issue to issue and the vast\nrange of creative geniuses that have contributed to it.\nSelecting the pieces which best reflect the\nlast 20 years of Dazed is no mean feat, and it\nis with delight that I can say Emma Reeves\nand Jefferson Hack, curators of the exhibi-tion, have risen to the task magnificently.\nThe collection stays true to the magazine\u2019s\ncore ideals and does not simply stop at the\nobviously beautiful, displaying many pieces\nthat can make for some very uncomfortable\nviewing.

Our caption writers are\nDazed.\nWith the abundance of material available\nfor viewing in each space, it\u2019s not hard to\nfind inspiration regardless of background or\ntaste, highlighting the accessibility Dazed\nhas built upon over the years. Above all, the\nexhibition reflects the mixed nature of what\nDazed has represented over the last two de-cades. Old and new readers can appreciate\nthat it cannot simply be labelled a fashion,\nmusic or photography magazine. Dazed is\none of the few \u2018all-rounder\u2019 cultural periodicals that manages to capture beauty and\ntalent from the unconventional, quirky and\noften tragic parts of life but retains its accessibility by not dismissing any artist or cause\nas too mainstream or insignificant.\nWhether you\u2019ve been a lifelong fan of the\nmagazine, want to experience snapshots of\ncultural zeitgeists of days gone by or simply want to catch a glimpse of Kate Moss\u2019s\nnipples, 20 years of Dazed & Confused will\ncertainly not disappoint.\n20 years of Dazed & Confused: Making\nit up as we go along at Somerset House\nuntil January 29.

    "content": "MUSIC\nWolf Tracks\nI am aware that most of you this week have been\nforce-fed a mindless barrage of exam-shaped shit-sandwiches and so I have taken it upon myself to\nbrighten your mood. I am doing this by the (frankly\nquite old) news that Refused have confirmed reconciliation after far too many years apart. Although\nperhaps more at home in the hardcore box, I feel\nthat Refused must be introduced to anyone interested in post-hardcore, if only for their pure badas-sery.\nHailing from Sweden, the band is consistently\nnoted amongst the most important bands in the\nhistory of alternative music. Their relatively short\nlifetime of seven years (1991- 1998) saw them\namass a huge following of devoted fans, and for\ngood reason. Poured into their sound is an incredible rawness which will resonate with any punk\nor hardcore lover. Their body of work composes\na Hardcore Gospel with each section proving to\nbe an improvement on the last. The final piece of\nthis collection is the album The Shape of Punk to\nCome. Not only is this album unmissable, but it\u2019s\ntitle has more prophetic worth than even the most\ndearly held scripture for it truly has morphed the\nshape of modern punk and hardcore music.\nTheir Viking ancestry becomes visible through\nthe savageness of their live shows. They didn\u2019t do\nany raping or anything though \u2013 just thought I\u2019d\nclear that up. I am NOT accusing the members of\nRefused of being perpetrators of ultimate Viking\nrape. Or pillaging for that matter. Although life on\nthe road is supposedly tough, so maybe some minor pillaging did occur. I mean we\u2019ve all had a little\npillage at some point haven\u2019t we? No? Just me?\nAnyway, back to the live shows. Somehow the\nmusic gets even better live and the energy of the\nband is incredible. The band admit that their final\ntour was \u201can awful experience\u201d but after witnessing footage of their last ever show, this feeling is\ncompletely hidden and even when they felt this\nlow, the projection of their music is amazing to\nbehold.\nAnnouncing their return will have made any Refused fan\u2019s decade and hopefully a couple more of\nyou will have been converted now as well. Remember to check out the Recommendation and come\nback next week!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendation\nWho\u2019s who?\nRan: I\u2019m Ran, lead singer and I sometimes\nplay acoustic guitar on some of the songs.\nLouie: I\u2019m the drummer.\nLuke: I\u2019m Luke, I play guitar.\nHenry: Henry and I play the bass.\nSo I heard you guys all met in halls?\nLuke: Yeah. We were all in Wilson last year.\nMe and Louis lived next door to each other\nand Ran lived sort of two doors down. We just\nsent an email around the hall and Henry said\nhe played bass. Thankfully in Wilson there\u2019s a\npractice room and it had a drum kit and stuff.\nIt started out as just playing a bit and messing\naround in there.\nI remember late night jams in first year... in\nOrient, just going into the kitchen. The guy\nnext door was never around.\nLuke: Yeah, good times.\nRan: Before Henry came in, after our first\nbassist had left, we used to just hum the breakdown to this one song.\nLuke: We\u2019d all just be like \u201cBum. Bum. Badumbum!\u201d\nRan: Haha yeah doing the bass bit... it\u2019s kind\nof sad. Then one day Henry came in and just\nabsolutely ripped the bass apart!\nLouis: It was just this quiet chap, who just\ncomes in and...\nRan: Yeah, that was awesome.\nHow long have you guys been together then?\nRan: We\u2019re all second year now so...\nHenry: About a year.\nLuke: We\u2019ve only started gigging this year,\ncause last year we were just writing stuff.\nLast year was more just for fun, wasn\u2019t it? I\nmean it still is, but like \u2013 it was more like just\ngo down, have a practice, write some songs.\nAnd then at the end of last year we recorded a\ncouple of songs... and it was just this year that\nwe started sending it out.\nWas it for a demo or an EP?\nLuke: We recorded four songs and a cover.\n\u2018Crossroads\u2019 by Cream.\nRan: And \u2018Brimful of Asha\u2019.\nLuke: Oh yeah, the Fatboy Slim version.\nLouis: I think we recorded some of it in your\nroom...\nTo get gigs or just to pass around friends?\nLuke: Both really, \u2018cause all the promoters\nwe came across asked for something. All we\nhad were rough recordings.\nLouis: We had miked up a practice room but\nit didn\u2019t sound that great.\nI used to record stuff on cassette, just \u2018cause\nit\u2019s the easiest way. Just press record and it\u2019s\ndone. You don\u2019t have to worry about any-thing.\nRan: It was handy though because you can\nlisten back to it...\nhim to come down and record it. We\u2019ve got a\nfew gigs now from the Uni Music League...\nYeah, I remember some lady was handing out\nflyers for that during Fresher\u2019s Fair... what\u2019s\nthat about?\nLuke: It\u2019s basically like a contest for artists\nand bands in London universities. I think there\nare about 40-odd bands. First round gigs are\nin the university and one band represents each\none. In the second round, you play a gig at\nULU, the University of London Union. We\u2019re\nplaying there on the 17th of February.\nThat\u2019s a nice venue.\nLuke: Yeah, it\u2019s really cool. There are 4\nrounds, so just the semi-finals and the finals\nleft after that.\nSo what do you do? Fight each other with\nguitars? Who has the sharpest guitar?\nRan: haha yeah it could turn into that.\nLuke: The winner gets an EP recorded by\nCharlie Hugall, who\u2019s done Florence & the\nMachine and Kaiser Chiefs. But we\u2019ve already met a promoter there who\u2019s got us a gig\nat 93 Feet East and a couple at Proud Camden. We\u2019ve just signed a contract so if we win\nthey\u2019re like, \u201cwe want to manage you\u201d.\nJust don\u2019t sign anything in blood.\n\u201c...Chicken burger!\u201d\nLuke: Sorry I\u2019m really hungry.\nYou can hear Wolf Tracks\u2019s recordings on their\nSoundCloud page, soundcloud.com/wolftracks\nCatch them at the ULU for the 2nd round of the\nUni Music League on February 17th\nSo who came up with the band name?\nRan: We were originally called Romans\nwhich has more meaning just because our\ndrinking room in Wilson was called Rome.\nAnd our house that we live in is called Rome\n2... but it turns out there are already about 5\nbands called the Romans, of varying success.\nLike someone in the 80s or the 70s...\nLuke: It\u2019s not very smart as well cause when\nyou Google Romans you\u2019ll get something\nabout the Roman Empire.\nRan: So there\u2019s a bike shop called Wolf\nTracks near where I live in Scotland and I\nthought \u201cthat\u2019s cool\u201d.\nLouis: Bit random.\nSo being Scottish I guess you appreciate the\ncold.\nRan: This winter was insane.\nHave you ever heard of arctic foxes?\nRan: I think I\u2019ve heard the name...\nThey\u2019re about the size of a housecat.\nRan: Oh I thought you meant a band!\nNo, no, not the Arctic Monkeys!\nI read somewhere that they can withstand\nsomething like -70\u00baC. Some American scientists had to \u2018borrow\u2019 some and put them\nin a freezer cause they couldn\u2019t figure it out.\nThey didn\u2019t even shiver.\nLuke: You can\u2019t even imagine something like\nthat...\nI think your brain would freeze.\nSo I heard some live songs on your SoundCloud...\nLouis: Yeah, my brother studied broadcasting\nat uni so he\u2019s into film and all that.

Do you have\nany other gigs lined up?\nJamie: We\u2019ve got a lot of gigs lined up actu-ally. There\u2019s this, then 333 on Old Street and\nRoadtrip Bar. We\u2019re playing a couple festivals\ntoo. One\u2019s a beer festival. Hopefully we\u2019ll get\nfree beer but I don\u2019t know...\nYou\u2019d hope so.\nAlan: We played at the last Silfest recently.\nThat was really good.\nJamie: Ah yeah, I missed that one.\nWhat happened?\nJamie: Well... I burned down my dad\u2019s shed\nin the garden. The whole thing just went up\nin flames. I ended up in the hospital with a\ncollapsed lung.\nAlan: Hey Jamie, didn\u2019t your dad direct some\nepisodes of Doctor Who?\nJamie: Well his dad sells drugs and Moroccan women!\nxxx: No he doesn\u2019t!\nJamie: Well, what does he do then?\nxxx: I don\u2019t know...\nEventually, the conversation wandered towards Bhutanese economics, Thomas the\nTank Engine and onion ciabatta.\n(Un)fortunately my recorder ran out of\nsteam and failed to capture those words,\nlike bad tumbleweed.\nPerhaps for the best.\ngrandma\u2019s birthday...\nJamie: You should have told her to come.\nYeah, it would\u2019ve been a ball. Playing Rage\nand Nirvana covers...\nAlan: I remember playing Nirvana when I\nwas like 13, playing in front of assembly.\nJamie: Is that on YouTube? There\u2019s a video\nof you on YouTube...\nAlan: Naked.\nJamie: ...playing in front of....\nAlan: No, not that one.\nJamie: There\u2019s that as well. I\u2019m talking about\nthe one where you\u2019re playing a drum battle in\nfront of assembly. And there\u2019s the other one\nwhere you\u2019re playing a really beat up drum\nset and all the comments are like \u201caw man,\nyou\u2019re drumset\u2019s shiiiit\u201d, \u201cthis is absolute\nbollocks\u201d and all that \u2013 and then there\u2019s one\ndude, Mr. Nice Guy, \u201chey guys, you should\nstop! This guy\u2019s really good. I wish I had a\ndrum kit.\u201d\nAlan: 50,000 views it had! It\u2019s just a shitty\ndrum kit! And just a really simple thing, just\nreally fast.\nJamie: It blew me away. That\u2019s why you\u2019re\nin the band.\nSo you met through YouTube? A modern ro-mance...\nAlan: haha I sent my video through the Jazz\n& Rock mailing list for an audition...\nJamie: You were late for the audition.\nHe\u2019s the drummer.\nJafar: I wasn\u2019t there. My house got burgled\nthat day...\nSo you guys just had rehearsal. How did it\ngo?\nSonam: It was good. As usual. Working on\nnew songs.\nHow do your songs come about?\nJamie: Different guys will write different\nkinds of songs and then we try to bring it\ntogether and kind of bring it all together to\nmake a common sound.\nSo you prefer to write songs first and then\nplay.\nJamie: Yeah, but we always start rehearsals\nwith a jam.\nJafar: Yeah, sometimes something will come\nout of just jamming and we\u2019ll hold on to that.\nIt\u2019s always good to know you can just improvise if you ever play out all your songs in a\nset. I think we know each other well enough\nthat we could just jam a bit after the set.\nHave you been going after a special sound?\nAlan: If it sounds cool... it works. [Stroking\nexam beard]\nJamie: Alan is classically trained!\nAlan: I\u2019m the most classically trained member of the band. I even studied how to play\nnotes on drums.\nWhat?\nAlan: No seriously.\nJamie: Jafar plays the harmonica\nOh that\u2019s cool. Harmonica sounds good.\nGotta buy them all - that\u2019s the problem.\nJamie: Yeah, hardly anyone plays them in\nbands. Sometimes some one plays the harmonica but you hardly hear them on albums.\nHey Jafar, remember that guy in that band\nwho bought a harmonica after seeing you play\nit at one of our gigs?\nJafar: Who...? Oh right, that guy... yeah...\nWho?\nJamie: We don\u2019t want to say any names.\nJafar: Yeah, no [mumble].\nHow did you guys meet actually?\nJamie: It was beautiful. Jafar and me met out\nof fate... I saw him play one day and I thought\n\u201cwhat beautiful music\u201d.\nJafar: I was fronting my own open mic night\nat uni, which was happening every week.\nJamie: So that was that and then we got a\nbassist and a lot of drummers.\nHow many drummers?\nJamie: 4...5...6...? I don\u2019t know.\nDrummers...\nJafar: So even though we had songs we\ndidn\u2019t play live for months and months because every time the drummer would flake\nbefore a gig.\nA drummer flaked on me once because of his\nHowlin\u2019 Circus\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto shares liquid bread while\nchatting house fires and the blues ahead of THROB\nGothic architecture makes a singular appearance in the Wild West\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nErnest Gonzales\nNatural Traits\nFriends of Friends\n2012\nThe scientifically-dubious \u2018most depressing day of\nthe year\u2019 has past us by without running aground,\nand unless you\u2019re Maggie Dallman, you\u2019ll probably\nmake it to the end of the month without being\npublicly humiliated. Let\u2019s shake off these January\nblues and start living again. Ernest Gonzales, let\nthe beats roll.\nThere\u2019s a lot to be happy about. The days are\ngrowing longer, scary American internet legislation\nappears to have stopped struggling under the water and died, and \u201cthat terrible thing I did on New\nYear\u2019s Eve\u201d (don\u2019t ask...) is receding comfortably\ninto the distance; the perfect moment for an album\nlike Natural Traits to come along. It has an infectious optimism that makes you feel like going out\nclubbing, but just for the dancing (people do that,\nright?)\nAlthough they say never judge a book by its cover,\nand in truth I distrust people who say that, I first\nlistened to this album because the album art is\ngorgeous. But it instantly wrapped its arms around\nme and had me hooked. \u2018The Prudence of Evolution\u2019, the opening track, builds layer upon layer\ncarefully and methodically, like a bricklayer building an impressive wall of sound before your very\nears. He makes full use of the broad spectrum of\nelectronica and shows just as much skill brewing\nsoulful deep house as he does mixing fuzzy bass\nwith 8-bit beats.\nHowever, the album has its faults. At times you\nbegin to wonder whether his influences, unconscious or otherwise, have crept a bit too obviously\nto the front row. \u201cAh, he\u2019s channelling Four Tet\nthere; this track is a bit M83; hold up, has he just\nripped off the guitar from Blue Sky Black Death?\u201d\nBut it would be a disservice to make too much\nof this. For a start, I\u2019m probably wrong, but more\nimportantly, Ernest Gonzales hits that perfect spot\nbetween ambient and body-moving beats in the\nsame way that Gold Panda does. This is an eminently addictive and satisfying album.\nThat said, we\u2019re not talking Lucky Shiner-esque\nbrilliance here; I\u2019m yet to find an album that tops\nGold Panda\u2019s debut. Speaking of which, if you\u2019ve\nfound one, drop me a line. (Or \u2018holla\u2019, as I believe\nsome people say...)\nIf you want to \u2018holla\u2019 at me (yo), you can find me pissing into the wind on Twitter @kadhimshubber. Alternatively, tweet @ernestgonzales and ask him if he\u2019d\nlike to make a donation to the \u2018That Thing Kadhim\nbroke on New Year\u2019s Eve\u2019 fund.\n\n"

Such a rare occurence in foil\nFencers building on success\nin anticipation of weekend\nWomen\u2019s 2nds dispatch Portsmouth 1sts with ease\nFencing\nHelen Pennington\nOn Wednesday, the Women\u2019s 2nd Fencing\nTeam played, and won, the fifth competition in\ntheir league, leaving them in third place with a\ntotal of three wins and two losses. The competition was the first one of the term, and saw a\nconfident team facing Portsmouth\u2019s First Team\nat home.\nThe match began with foil, in which Jenifer\nMizen (Jenny), Stephanie Martinez (Steph)\nand Elanor Oakley (Elsa) fought valiantly. The\nlead fluctuated between the two teams, with\nthe scores remaining close until Jenny gained\n10 points in one match, disheartening the other\nteam and giving a lead of 8 points, which Steph\nand Else improved upon to win 45-35.\nFollowing foil the team fenced sabre, during\nwhich Helen Pennington, Slavina Georgieva\n(Slavi) and Jing Quek (Jingles) did not lose a\nsingle match, winning 45-29. Finally, with their\nopponents thoroughly disheartened, and only\nneeding 19 points to win, the women\u2019s team\nfenced epee. Rebecca Razzey (Becky), Helen\nand Slavi only lost one out of the nine matches\nbetween them, and defeated their opponents\n45-35, giving Imperial a triple-weapon-win\nwith a total score of 135-99 - Portsmouth had\nnot even managed to reach triple figures.\nWomen\u2019s 2nd 135\nPortsmouth 1st 99\nMen\u2019s and women\u2019s 1sts prepare for premiership clashes\nIndy Leclercq\nlong we take) to decide what routine to do,\nPappity-boopity-poppity slotted in following\nAquaman\u2019s entirely intentional (not at all a\nscuffed shot) dummy.\nIf the first goal was good, the second goal\nwas better. The same routine left St Bart\u2019s\nstunned again. This time, Munter Gatherer\u2019s\npass pierced through the defence, leaving\nAquaman with a simple touch into the goal.\n2-0 the score, and it was no more than what\nIC deserved.\nThe third goal was something else altogeth-er. A loose ball popped out from Designer V\nand Fresher Ed played a Cook-esque straight\ndrive that crashed in off the post. A stunning\ngoal and a stunning finish to the match.\nIt should be noted that victories always start\nwith the defence, and Fritzl, Eager Beaver,\nB. Tablet, Free Willy and Gingypops had an\noutstanding game.\nWell done to the whole team, and here\u2019s to\nhoping they can stay on top for a while...\nP.S. At no point, did Kirby score. Ever.\n...Continued from Back Page\nHockey Men\u2019s\n3rd make\nshort work of\nSt Bart\u2019s\nThe Imperial fencing men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nteams stand to win their respective leagues\nthis weekend, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Southern Premiership, if they can fight off the likes\nof Oxford, Cambridge, and London rivals\nsuch as Queen Mary or ULU.\nThe women\u2019s team currently stand top of\nthe southern premiership, having won all of\ntheir matches in the previous weekend tournament held in Cambridge. Their closest\ncompetition is Oxford, who won three out of\nfour. Nevertheless, the girls registered a convincing win against the dark blues last time\nround, and expect to do so again this week-end. Captained by ISE undergrad Charlotte\nLevin, and featuring GB hopeful and Sports\nscholarship athlete Hannah Bryars, the team\nhope to defend last year\u2019s crown success-fully.\nThe men face a slightly more challenging\ntask, but are still feeling confident they can\ncome top of the league. They currently stand\nin second place, having lost to Oxford in the\nfirst weekend tournament by a single hit.\nCaptain Didier Nohlmans, a Physics PhD\nstudent, believes they can definitely beat\nOxford (and the rest of the teams) this time,\nwhich would ensure the IC contingent finish\nin first place. The men\u2019s team are buoyed by\nthe strength of their sabreurs Maiyuran Ratneswaran and Henry Gann, 6th and 12th respectively in the GB rankings.\nIf both teams retain their league titles, it\nwill be another feather in the cap of the Imperial fencing club, currently the most successful in the country \u2013 both the women\u2019s and\nmen\u2019s 1st are defending BUCS champions.\nThe matches will take place in Ethos on\nSaturday and Sunday; come down and support the team!

That\u2019s not just last\nnight\u2019s pizza, it\u2019s Topps Pizza with fragrant bell peppers, ground Argentinian\nbeef with a hint of chilli, gooey golden\nbrown mozzarella and a crunchy crust.\nThis is not just LSD: this is M&S LSD.\nIf anyone ever questions your motives\njust mention Francis Crick cracked the\nstructure of DNA while \u201clistening\u201d to\n\u201cLucy in the sky with diamonds\u201d. Tell\nthem you\u2019re solving the protein folding\nproblem. Oh, is that Pink Floyd in the\nbackground? That\u2019s just inspiration.\nAlcohol\nWe\u2019ve had booze for as long as we\u2019ve\nhad agriculture (and civilization): take\nsome sugar and yeast, leave for a few\nweeks and boom! Instant clothes re-mover. Effects are as varied as the\nmeans of consuming it: some just go\nquiet and sit there, possibly as damage\ncontrol because last time they got shit-faced they played knock down ginger at\nthe local police station. Others get overwhelmed by the amount of love they\nsofa while you watch TV that you find\nentertaining irrespective of quality. To\ntop it off, you just want to eat every-thing.\nCocaine\nSince it\u2019s not going to snow any time\nsoon down in London it looks like cocaine\u2019s your best bet for seeing anything\nwhite and powdery that makes you feel\nall giddy. It\u2019s also the second week of\nterm, so don\u2019t even say you can\u2019t afford it. Besides, if Scarface has taught\nus anything it\u2019s that the stuff makes you\nridiculously bullet-resistant, even for\nHollywood standards.\nHeroin\nSometimes life really gets you down:\ndeadlines, relationship and financial\nwoes, and the news hardly helps. For\n\u00a310 or so you can shoot up and let the\nproblems just melt away in an opiate-induced haze. It\u2019s a bit like Ocean Finance for problems: it consolidates all\nyour existing problems into one (prob-ably unmanageable) problem: finding a\nstrong enough vein and enough money\nto shoot up again. Before you know it\nyou\u2019ll be giving rimjobs to the janitor\nof Sherfield for cash. If things get really\nbad you might need to get a job at the\nUnion.\nCrack\nCocaine\u2019s badass freebase brother, not\nheld down by stupid ionic bonds. Apart\nfrom its addictive moreish qualities, it\ngets a bad rap from the people it\u2019s associated with. Of course everyone\u2019s going to think crack is terrible when you\nhave Charlie Sheen as pretty much its\nposter boy, who also recommends taking ridiculous quantities. Not to mention \u201cgangstas\u201d from \u201cda hood\u201d who\nsmuggle it wrapped in tin foil shoved\nup their rectum. Hardly a glamorous\nway to get high.\nEcstasy\nTouted as a \u201cclubbing\u201d drug because it\nmight possibly make the ordeal of going to a club not completely unbear-able. You actually want to dance, stop\ngiving a shit about how stupid you look\nand possibly even have some degree of\nempathy towards your fellow party-go-ers, as opposed to wanting to drag their\ntesticles across a rusty cheese grater for\ngetting in your way on the dance floor.\nDrugs. Delicious and mind-bending\nHangman does not in any way encourage the use of drugs because you shouldn\u2019t do them. And you shouldn\u2019t do them because they are illegal,\nwhich is a shit reason but it\u2019s good enough for the government. But if you must, here is a guide. We are the mum that packs a condom with her\nchild\u2019s lunch because the only thing worse than underaged sex is underaged sex and pregnancy. Or if it\u2019s with the PE teacher.\nHANGMAN\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40\nMethamphetamine\nIf you need your teeth removed but are\ntoo scared to go to the dentist, meth will\nsort that right out. Unfortunately, it\u2019s\na broad-spectrum antidental agent so\nthere might be some collateral damage.\nDon\u2019t worry, the gummy look works\nwell with your dishevelled hair and\nclothes. It will also limit your injuries\nwhen you try biting yourself to silence\nthe voices in a schizophrenic episode.\nKeep tuned for the series finale when\nyou finally die.\nCaffeine\nPossibly the superhero of all drugs, and\nlegal too. Gets you through all-nighters,\nand research has shown it increases\nphysical endurance and helps you to\nburn calories. Or maybe they forgot to\ntake into account that it kills your appetite like watching \u201cKill it, Cook it,\nEat it\u201d should (instead it just makes you\ncrave for meat and murder). You should\nprobably think twice before heading\nstraight for the Red Bull, though: getting the shits really isn\u2019t fun, especially\nwhen you haven\u2019t actually eaten any-thing. Now you know how an Ethiopian\nwith dysentery feels.\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday evening in the SAF building...\n.\nI didn\u2019t realise this launch was\ngoing to get political. They\nshould\u2019ve sent Andrew\nMarr instead of me. Shitfuckshitfuckshitfuck. They\nwere laughing at all the other\ntweets but now everyone is\nsilent. It\u2019s like Carlos Mencia\nsuddenly walked in the room and\nstarted making jokes. At least\nR Wintz over there\u2019s having the\ntime of his life. I bet it was him\nwhen he was fiddling with his\niPhone earlier.\nLol. I shouldn\u2019t appear too\namused though, I\u2019m meant to\nbe the Brian Cox of Biology,\nexcept more likeable and\nwith a less whiney voice.\nhave for the world and proceed to hit\non anything vaguely female-looking,\ntaking your shirt off to impress if need\nbe. Or cut straight to the chase and give\nthe object of your affections precisely\n\u00a312.60 to buy a drink, expecting something else apart from change in return.\nMushrooms\nSome people start seeing rainbows everywhere like they\u2019re looking through\na prism, some see God. But then again,\npeople claim to see Jesus in burnt toast\nquite regularly so don\u2019t be surprised\nif your God is just a delusion. A small\nhandful of people see every single inanimate object talking to them, but this is\nmost likely just a manifestation of loneliness and the need to talk to someone.\nWhen you\u2019ve eaten more mushrooms\nthan Mario, the bin will make a decent\nagony aunt in a pinch. Go ahead, press\nthe lever and pretend it\u2019s opening its\nmouth to speak. It is a bin though, so\nit\u2019s probably talking rubbish.\nMarijuana\nThe green stuff has the tendency of\nturning you into a consumerist\u2019s dream:\nyou hit a joint, then mong out on the\n\n"

As Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel famously\nsaid, \u201cfor the dead and for the living we must\nbear witness\u201d. He explains in an interview with\na representative of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, that the purpose of Holocaust Memorials, is to honour the memory of\nthose who were murdered and to remember, in\nparticular, for the living, who need us now. Indeed, \u201cthe living\u201d, the survivors, need our mem-ory, our compassion and most importantly our\ncommitment. A commitment to keep alive the\nmemory of the past, in the name of those who\nsuffered, which is undoubtedly essential in order to build our own future.

Auschwitz was the largest\nof the Nazi killing camps, where approximately\n1.1 million men, women and children, including\nJews, gypsies, the handicapped, homosexuals,\nSoviet prisoners of war and political dissidents,\nwere killed, out of a total estimate of 11 million\nassassinations throughout the Holocaust across\nEurope at the hands of the Nazis, from 1933 to\n1945. However, what meaning do these figures\nhold, with no knowledge of the personal experiences of those involved?\nRuth Barnett, aged 4 and her brother Martin,\naged 7, were sent, without their parents, from\nBerlin to safety in Great Britain, on what is\nknown as the \u201cKindertransport\u201d in the months\nbetween the Kristallnacht Pogrom of 9-10 November 1938 and the start of World War II.\nIt was as a result of the efforts of the British\nJewish Refugee Committee, which appealed to\nmembers of Parliament, that a debate was held\nrisk-free portfolio and true portfolio values taking\ninto account the risk of default.

This is a fitting venue as Bloomberg is a\ncutting edge financial information provider. The\ndesignated conference room has been host to a\nnumber of politicians such as Gordon Brown and\nDavid Cameron along with substantial finance\nprofessionals.\nI truly believe that the conference offers an\nabundance of opportunities for attendees. Like\nno other university led finance conference in the\ncity, this new style of conference evidently has a\nfocus point with a clear aim. By enabling the audience to be comprised on students from excellent\nuniversities along with city professionals, speakers will have the opportunity to go in depth while\nattendants do not feel overwhelmed. This can be\nachieved by our efficient presentation structure\nwhere the first fifteen minutes of each presentation will be dedicated to core facts and knowledge\nsurrounding the topic. The remaining forty-five\nminutes will be dedicated to more cutting edge\nand progressive material. Furthermore having\nspeakers mixing with industry professionals and\nenthusiastic students during networking sessions\nthroughout the day will provide the ideal opportunity to synergistically share a range of creative\nideas and form long term sustainable relationships\nderived from a common interest.\nIf you are interested in attending the conference you will be required to submit an application\nthrough our revamped website (www.nfwconfer-ence.com). The application process open to students will consist of a compulsory submission\nyour CV and a short question indicating your motivation in attending the conference. The process\nfor professionals will be a requirement of a professional email address to indicate current working\nexperience and a short summary of their motivation in attending. Once the candidate is successful\nin their application, professionals can purchase\ntickets for \u00a345 with students having the unique\nchance to purchase tickets at a discounted value\nat \u00a335.

Media coverage of Holocaust remembrance is no doubt only worthwhile if it is a call\nto action and a call to raise awareness of current\ngenocide, to speak out against hatred around the\nworld and in our own backyard and to push our\ngovernments to act, like the British Jewish Refugee Committee did back in 1938. Ruth Barnett,\nas an activist herself in raising awareness, will\nlink her experience to the persecution of Gypsies today, the last bastion of culturally accepted\nracism across Europe, which in her own words\nis \u201ca manifestation that we have not learnt from\nthe Holocaust\u201d.\nWe are approaching a time when Holocaust\nsurvivors and other eye witnesses of mass murder in the midst of our own contintent, will no\nlonger be alive.

The tracks introduce the story of Eve, a girl with much\npromise and a bright future, whose life\nfalls apart \u2013 culminating with a long\nstay in hospital. It is an album with a\nsad story to tell, yet does so in a mind-numbingly beautiful manner. Whilst\nbased on Stuart\u2019s band, the songs have\nan extra punch, making them sound\nwonderful. Whether this is thanks to\nthe orchestra that Stuart makes excellent use of, or the outstanding voices\nof Catherine Ireton et al., is left to personal choice.\nFollowing the releases, Stuart joins\nwith Barry Mendel, who produced the\nsix-time Academy Award-nominated\nThe Sixth Sense, to release a film, explaining what happens to Eve after her\ndeparture from hospital. Stuart always\nknew there was a story to tell with God\ncame to his head in 2003.\nThe film is funded by a combination of private and public funding,\nwith a target of $3m set. The Channel\n4 Alpha Fund has contributed, with\nsome \u201cfinancially blessed individuals\u201d\nworldwide making their own private\ncontributions. One of the more interesting funding mechanisms that the\nteam have undertaken is through use of\nKickstarter \u2013 a website where people\npledge to a project and receive gifts in\nreturn. Subject to the goal of $100,000\nbeing met, pledgers can expect a wide\nvariety of strange and exciting prizes,\nincluding pieces of the set, one-of-a-kind rarities, and appearances in the\nfilm. This is in addition to other fan-led initiatives, such as website visitors\nsuggesting people to be considered for\ncasting.\nGod Help The Girl is looking to be\na particularly exciting film, even if we\nonly know little of the storyline at the\nmoment. The plot that we have seen is\ndeep and intriguing, and the musical\naccompaniment from the earlier releases only helps to develop it further,\nas well as build anticipation of an excellent soundtrack.

The\nstory is set in Glasgow around Eve and\ntwo new characters, James and Cassie,\nin what the promotional videos call\n\u201cthe story of a better summer\u201d. In other\nwords, this is the tale of three people\nwhose lives revolve around music.\nEve, as a character, is a wreck. Overwhelmed by the pressure of a University education for which she has little\nregard, she becomes insular, isolated\nfrom her parents and friends, and an-orexic. Her parents, horrified, send her\nto hospital. It is here that the film picks\nup, focusing on how she builds herself\nback through music. It is highly likely\nthat this is after Eve runs off after a\nhospital football match \u2013 this is where\nthe story in the album ends.\nJames is also of poor health, but appears to have more life in his soul than\nEve did when she was at hospital. An\nEP suggests that Eve is fond of James\n(whom she met at the end of the story\nin the album), and like Eve, James\nTime to play casting-director: the above female looks like a cross between Audrey Tautou, Rooney Mara, and....hmm...

This is not the only\nthing they have in common \u2013 his health\nproblems also appear to be of the mental type, with the character profile\ndescribing him as spending as much\ntime as possible in his \u201csafety zone\u201d, a\n\u201csmall bedsit room\u201d.\nCassie, on the other hand, is vastly\ndifferent to the other two characters.\nHer profile describes her as \u201cposh\u201d,\nliving in a castle; yet also having a\nbubbly personality.

    "content": "H\numan activity may be delaying\nthe Earth\u2019s next ice age, a new\nstudy reveals, suggesting that\natmospheric CO2\nconcentrations need to be considerably\nlower for Earth\u2019s next climatic heartbeat to follow its natural rhythm. The study, by Professor\nChronis Tzedakis and colleagues at the Environmental Change Research Centre at University College London, published in Nature Geoscience, looks at recent geological analogues\nof the current interglacials in order to answer\na question that has, up to now, stumped climatologists \u2013 how long do we have until the next\nice age?\nOver the last few million years, Earth\u2019s\nclimate has been dominated by fluctuations\nbetween ice ages (or glacials) and their corresponding warm periods (interglacials), climatic states that are controlled by the amount\nof solar radiation reaching the high latitudes of\nthe Arctic and Antarctic. In turn, the amount\nof solar radiation reaching Earth on timescales\nof thousands of years is controlled by regular\nand mathematically predictable fluctuations\nin our planet\u2019s orbit during its transit around\nthe Sun. For example, precession describes a\n26,000 year shift in the orientation of Earth\u2019s\naxis of rotation, whereas obliquity, with a\n41,000 year cycle, results from the wobble of\nEarth\u2019s axis relative to the solar plane. Despite\ntheir predictability, complications arise when\nattempting to reconstruct or predict the climate\u2019s response to these regular perturbations.\nThis is because the Earth\u2019s climate is inherently complex, with many poorly understood\nprocesses that produce feedbacks and amplifications in response to changing solar insolation and greenhouse gas concentrations.\nIt is these uncertainties that mean that studying the timing of past glacial inceptions in the\ncontext of orbital variability is a bit redundant \u2013 the durations of past interglacials has\nbeen variable as a result of different climatic\nconditions and component responses. Despite\nthis, there are one or two candidates that may\nbe comparable to the modern interglacial \u2013\nin particular, one event that occurred around\n780,000 years ago. This climatic interval is the\ntarget of Tzedakis\u2019 study, due to similarities in\nthe amount of solar insolation to today. In fact,\ntheir modelling suggests that today\u2019s levels of\nsolar insolation would be sufficient to initiate\nan ice age in the next 1500 years, a remarkably\nshort amount of time. However \u2013 and this is a\nbig however \u2013 in order for an ice age to initi-ate, a threshold must be reached where atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations are low enough to\nThe next ice age may be late\nA super cool place to live, but at what cost?\npermit global cooling. Today, CO2\nconcentrations are around 390ppm and fast increasing,\nbut the ice age inception threshold lies around\n240ppm. The implications of this are massive\n\u2013 human activity is preventing the natural cy-clicity of Earth\u2019s climate and may delay the\nnext ice age, which is immediately imminent,\nat least in geological terms.\nSo, as the Global Warming Policy Foundation (the UK\u2019s leading source of climate change\nscepticism) suggests \u2013 we have a choice. Either we halt CO2\nemissions today and dress up\nwarm and deal with the next ice age, or carry\non the same and bask in the searing temperatures and flooding of the warm world of the\nfuture\u2026either way, climate change is here and\nit is here to stay.\nDOI:10.1038/ngeo1358\nEver since 1969, when J H Ostrom proposed\nthat theropod dinosaurs used their tails to\nmaintain balance during fast movement, scientists have suggested that a wide range of\nanimals, from primates to rodents, use active motion of appendages such as arms or\ntails to stabilise their motion. Now a team of\nscientists from the University of California,\nBerkeley, has found that by moving their\ntails, lizards can maintain a near constant\npitch when moving through the air after a\njump.\nIn their experiments the group made a number of Red-Headed Agama lizards (known\nscientifically as Agama agama) jump from a\nsmall block, or vault, to a raised platform. A\nhigh speed, 1000 frames per second camera\nwas then used to record their motion. The\nvault was covered with \u201csmooth glossy card\nstock\u201d, which meant that, as they jumped,\nthe lizards\u2019 legs slipped slightly \u2013 imparting an angular momentum to the lizards and\ncausing their angle of flight through the air\nto change. After analysing the changes to the\nlizards\u2019 pitch caused by this effect, the scientists found that this was less than would have\nbeen expected if the lizards didn\u2019t have a tail\nand theorised that \u201cby rotating their tails with\nrespect to the body in the sagittal plane, the\nlizards transferred angular momentum from\nthe body to tail, thereby reducing body angular velocity and ... body rotation\u201d.\nTo further test it the scientists constructed\na wheeled robot with an attached rod to simulate a tail and set it running off a ramp to\nsimulate the lizards\u2019 motion. The team says\nthat while \u201cinertial stabilization of robotic\nlocomotion has been modelled before, [their\nrobot was] the first with a specialized tail-like appendage for continuous inertial stabilization\u201d. When this \u2018tail\u2019 was moved in the\nway the lizards\u2019 tails had been observed to,\nthe angle by which the robot was rotated was\n72% less than when the rod was held fixed.\nApplying the model developed using this\nresearch to velociraptors \u2013 1.5m high theropods that lived in the late Cretaceous, the\nteam found that their extraordinarily flexible\ntails would have been even more effective\nin stabilising movement through the air than\nthose of the Agama agama. They conclude\nthat \u201csmall theropods like Velociraptor with\nactive tails might have been capable of aerial\nacrobatics beyond even those displayed by\npresent-day arboreal lizards\u201d.\nWhile this research is of clear interest to\nbiologists, the scientists believe the fact that\nthey managed to replicate the effect seen in\nlizards in a robot shows that their work can\nnot only \u201cadvance our understanding of appendage evolution\u201d, but also \u201cprovide biological inspiration for the next generation of\nmanoeuvrable search-and-rescue robots\u201d.\nDOI:10.1038/nature10710\nMaciej Matuszewski\nFELIX\nFriday 20 january 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nCarys Cook on how human activity may cause a delay in the next ice age\nHow leaping lizards use their tails\nIn brief\nLike us on Facebook\nMore planets than stars?\nScientists have found that planets around a star\nmay be the rule, rather than the exception.

Mr Occhipinti, who teaches\nFrench at the College, was due to present a lecture to the Political Philosophy\nSociety late last term but cancelled the\nevent in protest of what he sees as the\nthreat of a \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d to\nthe department.\nSpeaking to Felix Mr Occhipinti\nraised the issue of \u201cthings at the College with which [he feels] more and\nmore disturbed with\u201d. He believes that\n\u201cdiscrimination to humanities is on the\nincrease\u201d, and that this sort of \u201canti-intellectualism can go hand in hand with\nelitism\u201d. This discrimination has manifested itself in Humanities department\nhaving spent the past three years in a\nstate of near \u201cpermanent restructuring\u201d\n\u2013 the much debated proposed changes\nto the College timetable being just the\nlatest example following large cuts in\nprevious years.\nThese latest proposals are a particular concern of Charmian Brinson, the\ndepartment\u2019s Director of Language\nStudies. She says that the \u201cCollege Day\nproposals as they stand will have the\neffect of reducing student options and\nadversely affecting the overall student\nexperience just at the point when student fees are about to be tripled\u201d. Professor Brinson also points out \u201cHumanites Department was not represented on\nthe College Day Committee\u201d and that\nwhile the former Head of the Department, Professor Andrew Warwick, was\ninvited to one of Committee\u2019s sessions\n\u201cthe points he made at the meeting were\nnot incorporated into the College Day\ndocument\u201d.\nMr Occhipinti stresses that, whilst on\ntheir own the various changes to Humanities are reasonable; together they\npose a real threat to the Department. He\nbelieves that \u201cby toying with Humanities the way management is doing a tipping point will be reached from which\nHumanities will not recover\u201d and that\nthere is a \u201creal divide between senior\nmanagement and students and lecturers\u201d who support humanities. Felix was\nshown a student comment from last\nautumn SOLE survey which bemoaned\nhow \u201cdepartments officially encourage\nhumanities, but in practice, do almost\nanything to discourage students from\ntaking any course (or at least attentively\nkeeping up with it)\u201d.\nHe says that he does not understand\nthe false divide between sciences and\nhumanities and points out how beneficial the subjects taught by the Department can be to Imperial students. He\npoints to a quote from the Observer\nwhich he thinks explains it best: \u201cThe\nstudy of history, philosophy, languages\nand literature broadens horizons and\nanimates minds that go on to enrich\nsociety in many ways. The advantages\nthat flow from research into the creative\noutput of humanity might not be obviously financial, but they are incalculable.\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nAlexander Karapetian\nJonathan Peek\nThe Department of Humanities has spent the past three years in a state\nof \u201crestructuring\u201d\nThe Royal College of Science Union\n(RCSU) launched the Science Challenge 2012 on Tuesday 18 January\nafter holding an event that saw students turn out in force.

Tuesday\u2019s launch event saw the speakers\ntell stories of their experiences with\nscience communication, which were\npreceded by speeches from the Principal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences Professor Maggie Dallman on\ncommunication as a valuable asset\nand former RCSU President Jad Marrouche.\nThe event was modernised with an\ninteractive live twitter stream being\ndisplayed on one screen for the attendees to post collectively as they\nexperienced the event. The tweets\nwere aggregated under the hashtag\n#SciChal but the screen was shortly\nswitched off as there was no moderation mechanism in place.\nThe questions for this year\u2019s Science\nChallenge this year are as follows:\nLord Robert Winston: \u201cWhat are\nthe five main ethical issues that face\nmodern science and how do we tackle\nthem?\u201d\nPallab Ghosh: \u201cWhat is the role of\nscience journalism in the 21st Century?\u201d\nPeter Lacy: \u201cWhat scientific breakthrough should we focus on to provide\nsustainable food, energy and water for\nnine billion on a planet of apparently\nfinite natural resources, and why?\u201d\nMark Henderson: \u201cHow should politicians best make use of science?\u201d\nThe competition allows both Imperial students to enter as well as students from secondary schools and\ncolleges, with a separate prize branch\nfor external students. Two unallocated\ntickets to the House of Lords dinner,\nwhere the final is expected to be held,\nwere handed out during the launch\nto Annina Sartor, who successfully\nanswered the arithmetic riddle given\nwith 131, the number of years since\nthe RCSU\u2019s founding.\nRCSU President Luke Kanczes\npraised the launch, telling Felix that\nhe\u2019s \u201creally excited that [they\u2019ve]\nlaunched this year\u2019s Science Challenge\u201d, adding \u201chopefully, the questions will generate some fantastic\nresponses to some of the biggest questions facing today\u2019s Scientists.\u201d\nThe event makes a change from last\nyear\u2019s scaled down version, where the\nMaria Veiga\nRCSU were unable to secure sponsorship for the awards. The budget this\nyear is substantially larger and is reflected in the prizes.\nThe overall winner of this year\u2019s\nScience Challenge will receive a tour\nof the Large Hadron Collider at CERN\nas well as a cash prize of \u00a32,000. The\ncategory winners will receive a cash\nprize of \u00a3500, with the finalists all\nalso receiving a tour and dinner reception at the House of Lords.\nGuest speakers (left to right) Peter Lacy, Lord Robert Winston and Pallab Ghosh\n\n"
