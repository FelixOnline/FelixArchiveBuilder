    "content": "FELIX PROFILE CROSSLEY In the year of grace one thous an nine hundred and twenty six at two\no clock in the dark and stormy morning of December29 th, there appeared on the face of the earth one large moustache hotly pursued by Derek Riley Crossley, alias' Tash',a lias \u2022 Moo stash1, alias' The Tank', alias' Fa rook', or alias just plain Derek. In those days he was often referred to by his loving relatives as\" a sweet little thing\" but, alas, the ravages of time have played their part and now enough/ At the early age of four Derek began to learn French before he knew\nthe alphabet( no mean task for even the most advanced child1) In1934 he went to Bishop Stortford College where he stayed until he was eighteen, during which time he\nbecame head of the school and captain of the school's rugby, hockey and swimming teams. After a short course at Glasgow University he was\ncommissioned in the navy, operating on minesweepers, until he was de mobbed in the early part of1948. Then for one and a half years he pursued a diverse series of jobs. Ke obtained H.S. C. in six months at a cram school, then after helping to build Charring tons' brewery in Mile End Road he became an engineering apprenticed in Bristol. It was during the course of the latter that he added a beard to his then already famous moustache. In October1949 he entered through the illustrious portals of I.C. to read mechanical engineering at the City and Guilds,( it was at this time that he shaved off his beard). Throughout his career a tT.C.. Derek has attained many prominent positions. In1951 he was Vicepresident of Guilds, he has served on T.C Council for three years and been the I.C. representative on U.L. U. for two\nyears. Last year he was secretary of U. L.A;U. and at present is captain of U.L. R.F.C., vf0 n. Secretary of the Links Club and Guilds representative on the Old Central ian s Committee. He is a very keen sailor and swimmer and to his intimate friends he is characterized mainly by the following: his cheerful and willing nature, his moustache, his ability to sink a pint, and, lastly, by Ka teXT. The point that needs clarifying is Kate IT. She can be seen most days outside the Union, sometimes dressed in an old tarpaulin but at other times she is quite exposed. She is in fact his eighth wonder of the world, namely Derek' s much treasured1926 Morris Cowley. He acquired her in1950, since which time they have travelled to many wide and varied parts of Europe, including Switzerland in1951 and Scotland last summer. Whilst north of the Border, Derek was\nengaged in tunnelling on the Glen Quoi ck hydroelectric scheme. Asked what he thought of mining, he\nreplied\" it's merely aside branch of mechanical engineering\". However, it is interesting to note that at one particularly drunken party his moustache was actually cut for the first time in its life( I am not at liberty to disclose the burial place of the offender.'). Photograph by P.K.N. Ward UNION COUNCIL MEETS The new Union Council met last week for the first time this year, and finished its business in an hour and a quarter. The meeting first elected C.E. Morris to be the Chairman of the I.C. Entertainments Committee in the place of S. A. Scott, who is now in the armband the remaining time was largely spent in swift dealings with routine affairs. Reports of the Executive and the Overseas Students' Committees, and of preparations for the Commemoration Ball v.ere received, but there were none from the Vacation Works, Refectory, Books tall, and the other many committees that had not then met. There was a discussion on the importance of standard blazers of colours being sold only to members of the Union, and the meeting ended by deciding to add one further particular publication to the magazines in the Union Lounge. TOUCHSTONE The first Touchstone weekend this year soon worked up\nits subject \"The Press\" into a full blooded excursion through world politics, and then down to a resignation to the miserable ignorance of all the British race except\nthose represented at Sil wood. The students opening the discussion proposed that the Press fed public opinion with the material it' expect e dor deserved. The Special Speaker, Mr. James, Editor of The Times Educational Supplement, first blunted their narrow indictment, and then conducted the discussion with great dexterity as the company in general put forward\ntheir hc rr or fi cations of the Popular Press. The poor coverage given to this year's Commemoration\naddress was discussed as a case in the argument that even\nthe best Editors seem to need an atom bomb to burst before they realize the trends of Science. Mr. James challenge dI.C. to produce a satirical pamphlet on the presentation of Popular Science in newspapers. It was felt that ethical standards in journalism might be the first improvement - with a care lest the readers got\nwind of it and that this by the infusion of more University trained staff would be the best attack. The ownership\nof papers was not considered as bad as it appeared, and the Press Council and other such controls thought impractical. FASHION CORNER This new hairdo has been specially designed for us by the college barber, Fernando. He entitles his new creation\" The Bold Look\" or\" I've seen a ghost\". To heighten the effect of this hairdo, a little mascara and eye\nshadow should be applied behind the ears. A POLITICAL( TEA) PARTY Professor Levy again displayed his amazing powers\nof eloquence in an extremely objective talk on the subject of Current Affairs at the Annual Fresher s Tea of the Literary, Debating and Political Societies given on\nMonday, 20th October, at 5.15 p.m. The sceptical laughs, which arose whenever \" Russia\" or the \"Red Dean\"\nwere mentioned, were skilfully employed by the Pro fec^ or to illustrate the use of emotionally charged language\nand prepared backgrounds to introduce bias into factual statements. He went on to show that the record of the United Nations Forces in Korea was by no means as clear as the Press would have us believe. Although the provocative nature of Professor Levy' s address evoked no violent reactions this year there is no\ndoubt that the majority of his audience departed somewhat less complacent than they arrived. Earlier in the evening the Society' s activities were outlined by Mr. Hell Blackmore, who chaired the meeting and spoke on behalf of the Literary and Debating Societies. Mr. Steve Ruhemann, the Cha.ir man of the Politics. l Societies, appealed for a. wider College interest in Politics and introduced speakers representing Conservative, Liberal and Socialist opinion. It is to be hoped that Fresher s will respond to the appeal for support since, as was evidenced by the duplication of the committees, the s a jae small overworked band has organized both the Societies in the recent past, and\na transfusion of new blood is not only necessary but\nlong overdue. ANOTHER ANTARCTIC EXPLORER The' Illustrated' of October11 th gave* big splash, including frontpage picture, to the story of yet another accident to an ex I.C.e xplorer. The unfortunate man in this case was A lee Trend all( R.C.S.1946 to1949), geologist to an expedition to South Georgia in the Antarctic. At the end of December1951 he fell200 feet down a crevasse in the icecap and although he\nwas rescued, his leg injuries c used him to be sent back to this country for hospital treatment. The operation was successful and we were very pleased to see him during a brief visit he made\nto the Union at the end of the Summer Term.

    "content": "FELIX ICWA GET TOUGH The I. C.W. A. Netball season opened last Friday with a match against a mixed assortment of males. The pitch had partially recovered from the overnight rain and the going was good, if anything rather on the hard side. The game started eventually after several of the men had been put in their places by the ladies. Digit Power was observed to be defending the wrong goal whilst Bill Robinson, the men's shooter was\ninformed that he was shooting into his own goal. I. C.W. A. pressed hard from the start, the one remaining Twin being prominent so much so that several of the men thought that perhaps both twins were playing( this was the morning BEFORE\nCommemoration Ball). Derrick Crossley, the men's captain did some very useful work, his' best trick being that of hiding the ball behind his moustache and managing to keep an innocent expression on his face. Play continued with very few stoppages( there was no umpire) until at halftime the men\nwere leading85 Upon the resumption of play I. C.W. A. forgot their manners and\" got tough\" behaving in a most un ladylike manner. Several of the men' steam were dealt with most severly and all were badly bruised. The males because of their small stature were unable to retaliate and had to suffer in silence. Although all the superior sex were members of the Rug ger Club they are agreed that this was one of the roughest games they hadn laye d. Play continued fast and furious with both sides scoring more goals. Mike Holman went over in the corner for a beautiful try only to be told that he wasn't playing Rugby. After the match he was\nheard to remark that because of the number of fists flying he thought it must be Rugby. The match finished as usual with the men' steam victorious but unfortunately your reporter was in such a battered state that he forgot the fa j ore. The men ended the proceedings with three growls in answer to I.C. W.A.'a very feline sounding cheers. SOCCER3 t. Mark, and St. John.

College Oxford Won 4 - 2\nDave Glen shaw newly elected captain played his first game of the season on Saturday against Wadhara, his inclusion in the forward line improved the attack considerably. The. defence was still unsteady, although the half hacks' worked the hall much better than in the former games. Tackling was poor, as well as the head work of the hack division. Goals scored on Saturday last were by C lena haw. Briscoe, Wheeler and Hodge. Hargreaves replied for Wadham and the Kad ham skipper scored ORPHY DAY\nOn Wednesday 1 2 th November the annual boat races between our three constituent colleges for the Morphy\nand Lowry Cups will be rowed. The Morphy course is one mile5 furlongs, from Hammersmith Bridge to the University( Boat Race) stone at Putney Bridge, for the eights. The Lowry is a race of one mile for the second\neights, and the courses can be seen on the nap. yl ff^'* O tBS K*' Because ibis day has also been chosen for the Hospitals' Regatta, the Morphy and Lowry races will be\nrowed early in the afternoon, starting at2.30 p.m. At the time of writing only a few of the six crews have settled down into training and it is too early to forecast results from their performances On pap fr it looks as though there will be a good fight between\nthe two heavy Morphy crews, the Mines and the Guilds, the holders. Each of these cont a. ins several Henley colours, but the R.C.S. can be inspired to great things by the very immensity of their task. In the Lowry, the greater reso u ces of the Guilds of experienced Oars, should, nevertheless be regarded only with respect to the fact that the outsiders have won before now: witness the R.C.S. in1949 and the Mines last yes.r. The Boat club Dinner will be held on Friday14 th but the usual Morphy Night Hop will be held on the Wednesday .\nI cccc very disputed spot kick. The crosscountry club started the season in an atmosphere of gloom on hearing that several old members,\namong them the president, ha.d either failed or could not run owing to pressure of work. On Fresher s day, however, the past performances of the new members ma.de\nthe prospects for the forthcoming season seem much more\nhopeful. Since then the fresher s have proved them-selves worthy of their reputations and the club is once\nagain optimistic about their chances in the U.L. Champ ion ships. The first match, against Pearl Assurance Company SportsClub in Hyde Park over a3$ mile course, was won 3 4 - 4 4 , I.C. having the first three runners home,\nD.J. PAIN, W.A. ROBERTSON and T. BAILEY. The winners time being17 min.45 sees. The Poly Mob Match was run on Saturday18 th October. There was quite a good turn out from I.C.T. Bat ley finished fourth, D.J. Pain fifth and W.A.

    "content": "4 FELIX GUILDS FRESHER S' BUFFET On the evening of Friday October,17 th, the old hands of Guilds, together with the heads or representatives of each of the departments, entertained the Guilds' new boys. Speeches were, made by the distinguished guest I. Ir . J. Hosen, a Deputy Director of Research at the R.N. Science Service, an Old Central ian himself, the Dean of Guilds, and Derek Howe, ex president of I.C. The reply to the to as to x the guests was made by Mr. Good let in which he much regretted his education at Cambridge. The free beer was divided up glass by glass, the fresher s drinking from refectory glasses and the old hands from pots. Such is democracy. After the proceedings in the Upper Dining Hall were drawn to a close by the chorus, directed by Mr. Allsopp, giving arousing rendering of the wc ll known a iron a Boo malak a, the party gravitated to the Bar where many songs were sung. The fresher percentage by this time had dropped to some 5f\\, but those that remained were indeed very fresh. The party dispersed at10.30 p.m. in various conditions to their various abodes with the knowledge that the Guilds year had now truly e om men ced. MAXIMILIAN a AND THE ATOM BOMB Please don't mind, dear fresher s, if The college doesn't seem too glad to have you in its midst. The\nplain fact is that we're all utterly envious of you. That is why Felix, and such like show a rather condescending attitude towards you, and a large tendency to take The K ike out of you. But Why should 'we be envious of you? Because we\ncannot be fresher s again. We cannot have free copies of College and University Handbooks, we cannot have free teas and beer parties in our honour, we don't have club secretaries visiting us and being ever so polite and\nhelpful to us, we don't have free' hops' laid on for us. But above all, nobody takes a blind bit of notice of us any more ( unless we are mistaken for fresher s whilst gazing at the noticeboards outside the be.r and trying to persuade ourselves that it only says \" I.C. Railway Society\" once on the poster.) So, fresher s,take all our jolly, friendly banter in good part don't imagine that we despise you quite as much a.s we do.\nBy the way, don't take any notice of Felix editorials telling you what to do about clubs, work cooperation and so on. After all if you join too many clubs( more than4 I should say), you can always slack on\nthose you don't care for. If you brown bag, you will find plenty of others in your set who do too, so the fact that the rest of the college ostr ac is es you\nshouldn't worry you too much. And anyway if you area brown b agger you probably haven' tread this at B,Il, so I am wasting my breath, and it all sounds very Irish and ambiguous so I must stop before I begin to make you think that perhaps I am not sincere in all I say. BURP\np.s. Maximilian didn't really have anything to do\nwith the atom-bomb.\nTHE FRESHER S GUIDE\nTHE ALBERT ETCETERA S To embody the whole of any branch of culture in a single monument is a remarkable achievement. Let us then adopt a humble add it ude towards the Albert Memorial, whose noble Gothic cu mEir man cum Roman cum Greek appear a. nee is a vivid potpourri of the History of Architecture, priceless at \u00a3 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 . As Wordsworth said...\" He smiles not on fair Scienc' s humble home\nBut melancholic ally scans the Dome\". The Dome is one of the wonders of the earth, housing as it does a famous echo, a musical gas lamp and p. cycle track for spoon rattling staff, all of which diversions are provided for no extra charge in the gallery. With such virtuosity, what could the place be but a concert hall? The R.A.H. cost \u00a3 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 : perhaps this is why the nation rushed too s fend it on5 th November'49 when our bonfire burned the road by mistake, and16 were reported missing, court at last. This display( see PHOENIX REVIEW'4950) was overshadowed last year when one of our mountaineers went too far. The lamp recovered later from the summit of the Memorial was a sign of our spirit, rather surprising to those who criticise the bar. Among the Etcetera s we should not forget the V.&A. Museum. There, a few yards from us, lie many of the world's treasures. Altarpieces, coffin tops, teapots find a home the re.Dresses, gold statuettes, pictures by Constable, etchings by Blake, watercolours by the neglected English masters, all proclaim our need of beauty, a need which our lectures may sometimes lead us to ignore. Go and have a look. Watt. A. Wordsworth. THE DRAMATIC SOCIETY The Dramatic Society have now chosen their play for Christmas. This is to he\" The Jealous Wife\", an Eighteenth Century Comedy hy George Colman. It will he performed from the15 th to the18 th of December. The University Dramatic Society' s One Act Play Festival is being held earlier this year. Instead of at Easter, the dates are the four nights from the19 th to the22 nd of November, and three of four productions will he put on each night by the various college societies. I.C.a representing Shaw' s piece\" The Inca of Jerusalem\", probably on the Saturday, the last night of the Festival. It is hoped that each evening's plays will be discussed, for the benefit of audience and cast, by a critic. The theatre being used is that at the Institute of Education( near Senate House). Tickets will he available through the I.C. Representative on L.U.D. S. It is unfortunate that the series of articles, of which this is the first, should have so small an\na. pper.li nI.C., addressed as it is to those who are interested in books. No less than200 of you were\nmembers of the Union Library la.st year, a tribute to the popularity of reading a.s a form of entertain ment. Many of you axe members of larger libraries, and so have never bothered about the one on your doorstep. If you come to have a look at it you' ll realise your mistake, since our library c cnt a. in s the highest percentage of readable books in London. This is to be expected. Host of them are chosen from the suggestions book - which is always available or are the selections of the Library Committ ee, a group of students who know books, like books\nand a republic spirited enough to man the library and see that it is working. If the books you want\narent there its your own fault for not indicating your choice. The Union finances the li br ry to the extent of an annual370 for new books,35 for periodicals, \u00a35 for rebinding and 320 for equipment, mainly clerical. Other organisations supply us with books\nnotably the Touchstone d rant which gives mainly standard nonfiction works, usually authoritative tomes of limited appeal but valuable in revealing previously unknown facets of knowledge to students whe are, if they take their work seriously, unnaturally divorced from all forma of scholarship except\ntheir own. The Encyclopaedia Britt a nica rests on\nthe shelves a cats wing from Thur bar and Potter, Ibsen and Hemingway. Overcrowding of books - not readers will shortly become a real problem in a room which is too snail, though ideally secluded. In case it is the seclusion which has been keeping you away, let me record that the least confusing way in is via the door at the E. end of the Northside of Imp. In st. Road, up the stairs and turning right in the Guilds Library at the top. There are good chairs there too. If you cant find a. book to satisfy you you re hopeless, unfit for anything but a science degree. INTER VARSITY CLUB The activities of the Inter varsity Club, a group founded over six years ago by three Cambridge undergraduates, has been attracting a good deal of attention throughout student circles, particularly in London. As suggested by their name the I.V. C. is concerned with the organising of activities for students, past and present, who find themselves in London and who would like an opportunity of meeting one another and enjoying themselves at a minimum of expense. Membership today stands at over600 students and former students representing colleges throughout the United Kingdom. Informal dances are held every Friday throughout the year, and in1951 the Autumn Ball at Londonderry House was inaugurated. However I.V. C. is not only a dance club. Other activities are arranged in small groups it now nas sub clubs. The organisers of these clubs arrange visits to theatres, concerts and the ballet, give instruction in Scottish Country Dancing, conduct rambles in the Home Counties and lead the more hardy spirits to scale the mountains of North Wales. Arrangements can be made for tennis in the summer and squash in the winter months. The club office is at53, Pimlico Road, London,8.. W..1to which all applications for membership should be sent. Plans are now being made to obtain larger premises which would function as a social as well as an administrative centre. "

After a regrettable delay in seating the large number of staff, the Hector opened the proceedings by inviting t^e Special Visitor, Dr. Karl Compton, and Mrs. Compton, to join the platform party. Though it maybe doubted whether I.C. have yet mastered the solemnity of their newly created Commemoration, Dr. Compton' s clear and rich voice made his challenging speech properly the climax of the ceremony. An account of his address is given below. This was pre cee ded by the presentation of the newly elected Associates, Diplomat es, Masters, Doctors, and Honorary Fellows.

Compton, Chairman of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. lis address was on\" The Growth of Higher Technological Education in the Tv.' en tie th Century and th Benefits of International links in this Field\". After thanking the Governors for the award of his Honorary Fellowship, Dr. Compton went en to say that, he war, proud of the association between the two great institutions of M.I.T. and Imperial College. Many personal friendships had grownup and there had been a rapid interchange of new ideas. Dr. Compton e num s rated the people from this country, some from this college, who were now working at the Institute, and pointed out, that much of the inspiration and guidance for the establishment of M.I.T. in1360, came from Kensington. In discussing the growth of technological education in the20 the w fc vry Dr. Compton had time to consider only one aspect, that revealed by are mark of Sir Richard Southwell that Industrial Structure must determine the structure of engineering education. Since th j beginning of the SO th Century there had been tremendous advances in automobile, aeronautical, chemical and electronic engineering which had been accompanied by corresponding changes in the teaching of engineering and applied science. It must be realised that it is not, sufficient for education to fallow in dt is iry, it must als c anticipate the future requirements by wisely interpreting the trends and foreseeing the needs. This means education for research and development, for COMMEMORATION BALL Most of the FELIX staff who could afford a ticket enjoyed the Ball too thoroughly to record any clear impressions for their less fortunate fellows. Though\nwe were announced in sonorous tones and received by presidents, the true~. C. grain broke through the Park Lane\nveneer, even to the extent of a Boom a leia at the end. We have a vague recollection of a21 st birthday starting at Midnight, of eminent U.L. Hockey and Rugger\ngentlemen doing the Latin dmc es with gusto, of soft lights, and, softer and brighter, eyes.

This poses a, difficult problem ir the organisation of the programmes of the engineering schools, which is. continually with us as new requirements and opportunities arise. Dr. Compton c'oncluded,\" but one lesson I think stands out from the logico four experience; our aim should beat the present and the future, not at the past; for in the field of science the future comes quickly upon us\". After the address Dr. Compton presented to the chairman and Rector of T.C. the official greetings of theM. I.T. in the form of a leather bound manuscript. "

WEAHNE\nThe response to our advertisements in the last Fi LIX for help brought us in all but a few of the staff re need. There are still lv.lt r. dozen vacancies, mainly on the writing side, and we have yet to choose an Editor and a sports Editor, From some people we have been talking with, we gather that joining SJHLXX has gained the reputation of demanding a great deal of tine. Though this has been\ntrue when,as at the beginning of tem, the Board has allowed itself to fall too small band of experts, each doing three jobs at once, it need not be so. In the past year tho mechanics of the paper have settled down\nand the work hs been divided between tho Production Board and the Editorial staff. Apart from these, FELIX needs correspondents to report on specific clubs and activities. These conjoin the Editorial Board if su coe s s ful or maintain an in de pen dent special correspondence, as they wish. In the last fortnight re have missed several important functions because none of the six of us was able to attend then. V/e need correspondents to cov or the Lit.& Deb. Soc meetings, for the University Debates, and for several of the\" arlington Clubs to cover the forthcoming Cup games.\nV.'e also depend upon our readers to maintain a lively correspondence on our letters page. From time to tine we publish an individuals'\" Viewpoint\". We\nexpect replies to some. A correspondent today has taken up a Viewpoint on the effect of the General Studies' timetable on the Union, This is now open to discussion. FELIX letter page is open to any college subject except sex; but even that if there is nothing else, and if it is done with novel subtlety. It may be said that we of FELIX have taken unfair advantage of our circulation to recruit our staff: Phoenix, for instance, the Union termly magazine, is equally desperate. But it has also been said that FELIX is a large force In holding the college together, and whether this is fully true or not, we are the best publicity agency - by report and direct advertisement in the place.1 'ow our future is more certain; we can do our duty by reporting on the state of the Union week\nby week. There is a Union General sleeting todays\nattend it and argue about the things that are your life for three years. Afterwards, if your subject is not raised, or your courage not tuned, continue the free for all in FELIX, Whether your particular interests at College are on the edge of extinction or distinction, write us an article, and pour out your heart about it. CHRISTMAS CARNIVAL A CORRECTION In our survey\" The Term In General\" in the last FELIX, it was mentioned, in error that the R.C.S. will he running the Christmas Carnival this year. It will in fact he the turn of the GUILDS and the date is Friday,19 th December. Viewpoint:\nTHE DEATH OF STUDENT SOCIETIES The Lunchtim.e Lectures a. re avast success; the critics are confounded, the cautious converted and the faithful triumphant. The programme and the lecturers are superlative and the lectures era a med to capacity and observe, it takes4 C0 men to cram the large physics Theatre. V.'e are on to a good thing, end what we have\nwe hold-But the balance of nature has been disturbed. A constraint has been applied to the pattern of our habits end by a sort of social leCh r.te l.ier' s Principle our habits must change to remove the constraint. Two extra mural lectures or concerts per week are pretty close to enough for anyone and Tuesdays and Thursdays are long days anyway: half past five is too late e0r to a, and a talk without tea is intolerable. So home to supper\nand a deep arm chair! Sir, the blood that enlivens the lunchtime lectures is drained from the veins of the Student Societies and\nv/e diagnose a decline that may end in death unless a transfusion be quickly forthcoming. The Athletic Clubs are unlikely to suffer. Their members are loyal and their field is different. But the Social Societies the Literary, Debating, Philosophical, and Political and the Learned Societies Physical, Chemical, a. nd Engineering s tude: xt bodies such as these nay look to their wounds. The Bridge and Chess Clubs are not so much societies as institutions for the afflicted; they alone, and the Music Society, of course, can watch with complacence the trend of events. Would the Social Societies be missed if the Lunchtime Lectures do so much better than they, most of the things they exist to promote? They would\nnot. But Sir, an a.ctive hour of debate or discussion or drama tis ation is worth a passive week on a. bench in a lecture Theatre. The decline of a student society-is a very grave ill, touching the root of the Union. But, we have sa.id, what we have we should hold, and\nthe lunchtime Lectures have already grown far too precious to lose. Very well, what remedy do we suggest? Not to move the Societies' activities to Konday\nand Friday. It will be tried, of course, but we\nprophesy failure. The week-end beckons on Friday evening and broods notoriously over Monday. (The\nattendances atL it. and Deb. Soo. Meetings on Kondays\nduring the Session194950 averaged a little less than half those held on Tuesdays or Thursdays) while Wednesdays are sacred to field and river. We suggest the* the lunchtime lectures be moved to I'i on day and Friday and that Tuesday and Thursday be left to the Societies. They will have competition enough\nas it is, without stea.ling their pitch and abducting their members.\nGive the new scheme time to settle down before proposing desperate remedies for as yet dimly di so ern abl sills, you say? Sir, in three months' time there, will be interests vested in the status quo that the Vice Chancellor himself in all his robes would hardly budge. It may well be we are already tool a tel MARTIN SCPJ3LERUS\nFELIX congratulates: P.A.Le min( Third Year Org. Chera.) on his marriage to Kiss Brenda IHVddleton in August last. Letters to the Editor\nDear Sir, IMPERIAL ECHOES I wonder if this new session, and the fresh bloc d it brings, will awaken the College spirit which we so conspicuously lacked last year? I don't think so atleast not without radical changes somewhere, and I think I know where. Imperial College is one College in name\nonly; an R.C.S. man never knows whether to buy a Guilds man a drink or de Dag him. So let's reduce the three colleges to academic bodies dishing out the A.R.C. S.,A.R.S. M. and A. C.G.I. Let's do away with Morphy Day( ask any R.C.S. man about this),3 set softies and scarves, the annual Sports( and reorganize on an interdepartmental basis), and the three separate Unions. In their place we could have one real College and everyone would know where they belonged; the I.C. teams could be trained as single units all the time, and who knows, we may rouse as park of enthusiasm in that mass of brown bag gers at present carried by about ten percent, of the members, Blue y. Sir, The low standard of Mines' Night In recent productions h&sca used considerable concern not only to members of Hie Dram& tic Society, but also to other discriminating members of the Union. V/e feel that the subversives ct iv i tier. of the miners should be confined to plays lending themselves to such treatment. In drawing the attention of the miners to the fact that our forthcoming production\" The Jealous Wife\" by George Colman, is sti cha play, we hope for their cooperation in our more serious ventures. Discriminating miners may find the play in\" Lesser English Comedies of the18 th Century\" published by Oxford University Press. Remember\" However ready be thy wit, x A little forethought sharpens it\". B. V.L Mter. President, I. C.5.SX The quotation is from\" Lesser English Poems of the20 th Century\" not published by Oxford University Press. "
