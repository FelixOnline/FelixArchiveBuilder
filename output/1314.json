Dydy\nbynciedig \u2018n gyfa i mewn Cymraeg\nALBUM REVIEW\nI can tell what most of you are\nthinking after looking at the title.\nYou\u2019re thinking: \u201cGruff Rhys, lead\nsinger and songwriter of the Super\nFurry Animals, has just produced\na solo album, but it\u2019s written\nentirely in Welsh.\u201d And since there\nare only about five people in the\nentire world who can fluently understand this Celtic language, you\nmight think you won\u2019t be able to get\nit. Right?\nWrong! The genius of Gruff\u2019s\nwork, as shown with the Super\nFurry\u2019s output, is his ability to make\nimmediately catchy, and occasionally beautiful music, combining elements of the Beach Boys and other\nassorted 60\u2019s pop with the epic view\nof 70\u2019s prog bands like Pink Floyd,\nwithout dragging it out into pretentious drivel. Plus, a quick look on\nhis website (www.placidcasual.com)\nwill give you an overview on what\nhe\u2019s singing about.\nHere you\u2019ll learn that he\u2019s up to\nhis usual tricks of writing songs\nwhich tackle modern issues in his\nown lopsided way, or creating his\nown idealised world. Take Epynt,\nnamed after a Welsh mountain, but\nis cleverly twisted into a Pound vs.\nEuro song (His conclusion? \u201c\u2026it\u2019s\nbetter to get rid of money altogether\u201d), which will lodge itself into your\nbrain with its shouty chorus.\nFurther songs will reveal the\nknack he has for creating unique\npop music. Rhagluniaeth Ysgafn\n(loosely translated at May My\nDestiny Be Easily Digested), with\nits cutting guitars, organ parts and\nrandom soft toy squeaking providing\na backing to his confession. Ni Yw Y\nByd (We Are The World), which may\nseem like an innocent song about\nuniting the world, but hides references to revolution and confusing\nyour enemies.\nThe areas that stand out from this\nalbum are the mini-stories that run\nthrough it, adding an extra depth\nto the album, which is not usually\npresent elsewhere. Pwdin _y (Egg\nPudding) provides a two part tale\nabout falling in love with a woman\ncalled Egg Pudding. The first part is\na bouncy song reflecting the lust at\nthe start of the relationship, whilst\nthe morose second part reflects\nthe crumbling relationship and the\ndeath of Ms. Pudding. It feels truly\ntragic with Gruff\u2019s off-key voice\njuxtaposed with the slow arpeggios\n\u2013 a testament to the strong musical\ncraftsmanship on display.\nThe other tale is about living in\nand leaving Caerffosiaeth (Sewage\nCity), starting off with a Kraftwerkinspired electronic montage transforming into a beautiful conclusion\ncomplete with layered vocals and\ncar noises as he\u2019s travelling away\nfrom and missing his home.\nEven the weakest moments, such\nas the plodding conclusion, are\nstrong enough not to dampen the\nenjoyment you can get from the\nalbum. I\u2019ve been playing this lo-fi\ngem constantly this week. I recommend you get yourself a copy and\nsee for yourself what makes it so\naddictive.\nMatthew Hartfield\nGruff: ag \u2018r Super Furry Animals\nHomeless\nwhores?\nSINGLE REVIEW\nThe new generation of skinny pop\nrockers is currently flooding the\ncharts. Loved by kids and adults\nalike for their catchy guitar hooks\nand melodic vocals, there seems\nto be an endless demand for bands\nsuchasTheKillers,FranzFerdinand\nand The Others.\nCue The Vacation, strutting\nstraight out of LA with their debut\nsingle, already praised by the ever-popular Jet. Destitute Prostitutes\nmay not have the universal appeal\nof its contemporaries, which is\nprobably due to Ben Tegel\u2019s explicit description of Hollywood\u2019s illicit\nindustry.\nThe single uses a standard formu-la: rhythm-heavy guitars, bluesy riffs\nand stripped down drums. Sounding\nlike the plucky love child of Amen\nand The Von Bondies, Destitute\nProstitutes is a strange mix, but it\nis thrashed out with charisma and\nsuperb vocals that transform what\nshould be a run-of-the-mill track\ninto a cocky display of rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\nWorth a second listen, the sounds\nof The Vacation are promising and\nhave already wowed UK audiences\nat Leeds and Reading festivals. We\neagerly await the follow-up album.\nNick Simpson\nThe Vacation\nDestitute Prostitutes\n(Echo)\nHHHHI\nFile under:\nCharming lo-fi pop.

For more\ninformation, visit www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/elections.\nJAMES DEVINE\nPRESIDENT\n\u25cf The President is the figurehead of Imperial College Union, with ultimate responsibility for all its activities\n\u25cf There are 5 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)\nThe Union is an organisation which\nexists to provide for you as a student\nand to speak up for you in College.\nUnion clubs and societies are\nan integral part of student life at\nImperial. I am an experienced and\nactive member of the Union. I\u2019ve\nbeen a club chair and a club treas-urer. I edited Guildsheet, the engineering students\u2019 newspaper, and\nI\u2019ve written for Felix and Live!\nCollege must put students first. It\u2019s\nthe little things, like having a lunch\nhour, being consulted about changes\nto our university, or at least being\ngiven adequate notice. I\u2019m committed to supporting faculty unions to\nbuild better student representation\nacross college so that all students,\nincluding MSc and Post grads, get a\nsay in how things are done.\nThe Union needs a new website,\nan intranet and a new finance sys-tem, I\u2019ll make sure we get these\nwithin a year. We can do more to\nsave the environment and save\nmoney at the same time, by doing\nthings like running the union minibus fleet on bio-diesel. I support the\nidea of a Fairtrade university.\nI\u2019ll make the time to listen and\nanswer emails personally.\nMy pledges\u2026\n1) A smoke free bar area in the\nUnion.\n2) Direct communication between\nsabbaticals and students.\n3) Less money on full time union\nstaff, more money for clubs and societies\nSure we\u2019d all like more coffee bars\nand better catering, but anywhere\ncan serve a double mocha-choca-latte. The Union is the only place\nproviding your representation.\nSAMEENA MISBAHUDDIN\nIt\u2019s at the start of term that so many\nof the Union\u2019s important services are\ndelivered, so we need a President\nwith experience and the ability to\nmake changes immediately.\nAs current Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) I\u2019ve achieved\nresults already, taking leading roles\nin the Strategic Review \u2013 the Union\u2019s\nbiggest ever student feedback\nexercise \u2013 restructuring the club\nbudgeting system, and the Union\nrefurbishment project. I\u2019ve fulfilled\nmanifesto promises including reinstating nightbuses, improving feedback and working towards a Union\nCoffee Bar.\nHaving helped get these started,\nI\u2019m most qualified to see them\nthrough; a newcomer would take\ntime to learn the ropes and gain my\nknowledge and experience.\nThe Student Activity Centre needs\noverhauling so we must implement\nthis over the summer, starting by\neliminating the excessive paperwork involved in running clubs/soci-eties and replacing them with simpler online systems.\nImproving communication\nbetween the Union and students\nneeds to be a priority, with every\nstudent knowing what we do, how\nto get involved and who\u2019s there to\nhelp. We can achieve this via Felix\narticles, a more comprehensive and\nuser-friendly Union Website, adopting a more approachable style and\nhaving a campus-wide presence.\nI\u2019m committed to extending\nlibrary hours year-round, improving integration for outlying cam-puses, and better representation\nfor Postgraduate and International\nStudents\nEveryone benefits from a better\nunion \u2013 with a President committed\nto the needs of all students. With my\nexperience and track record, I\u2019m the\nonly candidate who\u2019s guaranteed to\nhit the ground running and deliver\nresults.\nMORTEN OLESEN\nI\u2019m running for President because\nI believe I\u2019m the best person for the\njob. I will not make loads of promises I won\u2019t be able to keep, but I do\npromise that I will listen carefully\nto the students, represent them to\nthe best of my ability and broker\nthe best deal possible. Also, I promise to provide better resources and\nadministrative support for clubs and\nsocieties. Lastly, I promise to make\nthe Union a venue that caters for\neveryone regardless of their ethnic-ity, religion or other beliefs.\nMy main aim as President will be\nto gain the trust of the students; I\nbelieve I can do this. I have leadership experiences both from various\nclubs as well as the Union, where\nI worked for almost three years. I\nsit on Union Council as well as the\nExecutive Committee and I\u2019m the\nACC Vice Chair this year. I hope\nthese experiences have put my finger on the pulse of students\u2019 opinion\nof how the Union should be run.\nWe must elect a candidate representing the broadest student opin-ion. Whether you believe I\u2019m the\nbest candidate or not, the important\nthing is for the majority of the students to elect who they believe to be\nthe best person to represent them. I\ntherefore strongly urge all students\nto vote so we can truly claim to\nhave a Union run by students for\nstudents.\nSIMON RAWSON\nAfter four year\u2019s involvement with\nICU, at every level, I have strong\nbeliefs of what I would deliver as\nPresident:\nIdentities\nStudying in a vast, anonymous city,\nat a large intensive university, everyone needs something to identify\nwith. Making this possible is one of\nICU\u2019s most important roles. I recognise the importance of all the constituent groups which make up ICU,\neverywhere. Crucially, ICU must\nbe in the background supporting\nthese groups, not placing hurdles in\ntheir path or trying to force them to\nagglomerate under one \u2018brand\u2019.\nStudent Activities\nAlthough student activities at ICU\nare already amongst the best in the\ncountry, I will work to strengthen this\nsituation, ensuring that resources,\nboth financial and practical, are in\nplace to support activities. I support\nthe current moves to modernise\nBeit Quad, but will ensure that student activities are not jeopardised\nin any way \u2013 in terms of finance or\nfacilities.\nValue from Services\nIn South Kensington, some of the\nUnion services (e.g. Catering, Shop)\nare underused. I believe that we\nshould seek to more fiercely challenge our commercial competitors\n(e.g. WHSmith) in terms of both\noffering and value for money. I\u2019m\ncommitted to this at all of our cam-puses, so that services really do\nwhat you want.\nRepresentation\nArguably the most important\nrole of the Students\u2019 Union is\nRepresentation. I see the role of the\nPresident as your ultimate repre-sentative, responsible for actually\nmaking your voice heard to College\nand, if need be, on wider issues\nwhich affect you too.\nCOLIN SMITH\nIt\u2019s time for radical change in the\nway our students\u2019 union is run.\nThe illegal war and continued\noccupation of Iraq have left over\n100,000 dead, whilst our so-called\nrepresentatives sat back and did\nnothing. Top-up fees were forced\nthrough against the biggest ever\nrebellion in the Labour party, with\nthe full support of our rector, and\nagain our union\u2019s response was piti-ful. Time and again the threat and\nimplementation of increased hall\nrents is allowed to pass almost without challenge from our sabbaticals.\nOur equal opportunities policies are,\nat best, weak. For all these reasons\nand more, it is time for change.\nOver the last few years I have\nbecome increasingly involved, and\nfrustrated, with the union bureauc-racy, first getting involved with student council and now as the union\u2019s\nWelfare Campaigns Officer. This has\nmade me even more determined\nto help take our union out of the\nhands of the hacks, and turn it into a\nfighting, democratic, representative\norganisation.\nI have also been heavily involved\nwith the mobilisations against\ntop-up fees, George Bush\u2019s visit\nto London last November, and the\nongoing conflict in Iraq. Recently,\nI have been proud to be part of the\ncoalition in college fighting for justice for Babar Ahmad. The union\u2019s\nsomewhat reluctant support for this\ncampaign is an important, but small\nstep forward. Elect me as President,\nand we can make giant leaps.\nIt\u2019s time for change.\nFOR AN ANTI-WAR, ANTIFEES, FIGHTING STUDENTS\u2019\nUNION\u2026 VOTE COLIN SMITH for\nPRESIDENT.\n\n"

Its students to be satisfied.\nSo then we ask: how can that be achieved? There is no simple\nanswer; the needs are limitless: cheap food & drink, lively\nstudent bars, well funded & active clubs & societies, the list\ncontinues for as many students as you can find.\nMany people want many different things and as DPFS I\nwould strive to help everyone get better value from our outlets\n(bars, catering and retail); make sure clubs and societies get\nfunded more competently; and draw on the practices of other\nuniversities and see what they do well and how we can emulate\nthat. Our Wednesday and Fridays have recently fallen below\npar and I would give my support in trying new things to attract\ndifferent student groups into the building throughout the days\nand nights.\nNobody can promise miracles, but with a \u2018career\u2019 history\nthat has had me doing everything from participating in a club\nto financially overseeing over 45 of them (representing over\n20% of the total) as ACC Treasurer \u2013 which encompasses the\nmajority of competitive and graded sport in Imperial College\nUnion; both drinking in and working behind our bars for the\nbetter part of four years and being involved in the Union\u2019s\nrecent Club & Society Finance Review, I believe I have the\nknowledge, experience and working relationships over all the\nother candidates to get the job done best.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (CLUBS & SOCIETIES)\n\u25cf The DP(C&S) is responsible for all the Union\u2019s clubs, societies and student activities\n\u25cf There are 2 candidates, plus the option to Re-Open Nominations (see page 13)\nSIMON MATTHEWS\nWhy should you vote for me as DP (C&S)?\nSimply put, you\u2019d be getting someone who is\nexperienced, competent and who has a track\nrecord of openness and improving communi-cation. Having spent the last couple of years\non the SCC exec; firstly as treasurer and now\nas chair I am aware of many of the current\nissues facing clubs and societies in the union\nand have been working hard trying to improve\nmatters. I have been an active member of a\nwide range of clubs, including sports and recreational ones, giving me knowledge of some\nof the challenges that they face.\nAs DP(C&S) I would continue the war on\nbureaucracy. Some paperwork is a necessary\nevil, but I would continue the trend of moving\nto online forms, reducing the work that club\nofficers have to do.\nThe recent strategic review highlighted a\nnumber of issues. The proposed redevelopment of the Beit building would allow us to\nmake better use of the available space. There\nis also the matter of room bookings. Some\nrooms stand empty for most of the year, while\nothers are fought over tooth and nail: I would\nplan to enable these less-popular rooms to\nbe used more effectively. One of my ultimate\ngoals would be to see every club have a \u2018home\u2019,\nwhether it\u2019s an extra gym for the martial arts\nclubs, or customised room for social clubs.\nRemember, a vote for Simon is a vote for\ncompetence and experience.\nHello all, as I know you\u2019re all busy I\u2019ll keep this short and to\nthe point. Fundamentally I stand for three things that form\na catchy slogan: responsibility, accountability and approach-ability.\nResponsibility is because I was treasurer of ICU Sinfonietta\nduring their most successful and expensive tour to date, with\na budget in excess of \u00a325k and many challenges along the way\n(anyone who\u2019s tried to pay Russians in advance will know about\nthis). Secondly I am currently the treasurer of ICU RAG which\nwill hopefully donate in excess of \u00a310k themselves, counted and\nbanked by me and my team.\nAccountability represents my view that all sabbatical officers should be able to be held to account by the members of the\ninstitution that is ICU. If you had an issue with the way I did\nsomething, I\u2019d strongly encourage you to question me about\nit.\nApproachability is for all you budding treasurers out there. I\nknow how hard it can be to run a club and budget for it. I also\nknow that your job is the most thankless in any society and\nthink that there should be more support out there for all 300 of\nyou. I would like to provide that support.\nSo, I think you should vote for me because I have the ability\nto do the job, are willing to be questioned on my methods (and\njustify them) and the enthusiastic nature to get the job done\nand help people.\nMore Money for C&S!\nI will prioritise the Union\u2019s Money better, allowing for a larger\nchunk to go towards the Clubs & Societies. I will also lobby for\nan increase in our overall funding, to give Clubs and Societies,\nrather than just admin, more.\nMore Fun Less Forms!\nI will move most, if not all, the day-to-day financial administration for Clubs & Societies online. I will also campaign to move\nthe rest of the C&S administration online.\nLess Fiction More Fact!\nI believe very passionately that students should know what is\nhappening when it is. Thus, whenever I am doing something,\nbe assured that I will let the people who matter, the Students,\nknow.\nFor Students By Students!\nI will open the financial sections of the Union to greater student involvement, and scrutiny. Thus, if they want something\ndone, they\u2019ll be able to see whether it\u2019s happening or not.\nReal Action Not Gimmicks!\nI have a proven track record of delivering the promises I make,\nboth the very small ones to the very large ones. So be assured,\nwhen I say I\u2019m going to do something, I actually mean it!\nA New Union Is Possible!\nI passionately believe that all students, irrespective of their\nbeliefs, should be entitled to help within the Union. I feel that\nwe should all work together to make a better Union for all.\nJAMES THATCHER\nI believe that Imperial\u2019s greatest asset is its\nclubs and societies; we currently have over\n250 clubs with thousands of student members\nand hundreds of dedicated officers. My aim\nas DPCS would be simply to perform my\nduties in an organised and efficient manner; it\nsounds obvious, but having been a club officer\nI know how vital those two things are.\nClub officers have to be well organised in\norder to hand in forms on time, and should\nexpect them to be handled efficiently once\nthey have. In order to aid this I will continue to\npush for more online documentation, a service\nwhich should have been implemented many\nyears ago.\nThe year ahead will be both very exciting\nand very challenging for many clubs. Most\nobviously for the indoor sports clubs with the\nopening of the new sports centre, but also for\nmany others with the closure of Southside\nand its gym, and the potential restructuring of\nthe union building. I will continue all the hard\nwork of the previous DPCS and CSC chairs\nin ensuring that the best deal is reached for\neveryone involved.\nI could promise all sorts of outrageous things\nthat I couldn\u2019t possibly achieve, but I won\u2019t. All\nI promise is to give every person who votes for\nme a planet of their choice when I\u2019m ruler of\nthe Universe*, and to do my best to represent\nall the clubs and societies so they can achieve\nwhat they want.\n*Except Uranus. First come first served.\n\n"

We broadcast 24\nhours a day from our studios\nin the showbiz hub that is the\nBeit Quad Media Centre, also\nhome to Felix (apparently it\u2019s\na newspaper) and alleged television station STOIC.\nSo why are we suddenly\nwanting to talk to you? Well,\nit\u2019s that time of year when\neveryone is fed up with their\ndegrees (or is that just me?),\nand we noticed a few gaps in\nour schedule just waiting to\nbe filled by good folks like you.\nWithin a matter of weeks you\ncould be presenting your very\nown radio show.\nWedon\u2019tmindwhatit\u2019sabout\nor what kind of music you play.\nThe beauty of student radio is\nthat we\u2019re not constrained to\na particular genre like \u2018real\u2019\nstations are \u2013 we have shows\nranging from mainstream\npop and R\u2019n\u2019B to hard rock\nand dance, with everything\nin between. If talk is more\nyour thing, we\u2019ve got that too,\nincluding a wide range of science programming for those\nof you that can\u2019t get enough!\nBehind the scenes, IC Radio\nis constantly expanding and\nimproving its facilities. Soon\nyou will be able to hear us in\nthe Union and JCR, and we\u2019ll\nbe able to record live band\nsessions in our refurbished\nproduction studio.\nWith so many big changes\naround the corner, not least\nthe imminent destruction\nof Southside, we\u2019re holding a development meeting\nTONIGHT (Thursday) to\ndiscuss the direction the station will be taking over the\nnext few years. Where will we\nbroadcast? What kind of shiny\nthings should we be buying?\nShould we change the logo?\nYou know, earth shattering\nstuff!\nPlus it will soon be time to\ndecide who is going to run the\nstation next year, so if that\nappeals to you, now is the\ntime to get involved.\nAs an extra enticement,\nafter our meeting we\u2019ll retire\nto the Union for the evening\nand free beer will be available for all paid-up members.\nIC Radio membership costs\njust \u00a38 for the year \u2013 and you\ncould easily recoup that in\nfree beer!\nSo join us at 6pm tonight in\nthe Media Centre Common\nRoom (Beit Quad, West Wing\nbasement \u2013 swipe through the\ndoors, down the stairs, left\nand left again).\nStarting next week, we\u2019ll\nintroduce you to some of the\nshows currently on IC Radio,\nand explain why they deserve\nyour attention. In the mean-time, don\u2019t forget to turn up\ntonight, or to tune in \u2013 we\u2019re\non 999AM in Southside and\nLinstead halls and on 1134AM\nacross the Wye campus\n(thanks to the IC Trust). You\ncan also listen online and\ndownload shows from the\narchive at www.icradio.com.\nIC RADIO\nTurn on, tune in... free beer!\nBy Alex Jermstad\nOne of Imperial\u2019s newest and fastest growing\nclubs and societies is ICUPAIN, which aptly stands\nfor Paintball Association,\nImperial Nutcases. Their\nfirst main event as a club was\nto compete in the first InterUniversity paintball tournament to be held in England\nfor over two years.\nOn an extremely cold, dark\nmorning back in November,\na ten-strong team piled into\nnumerous cars and mini-vans\nto begin the joyous two hour\ntrek up to Birmingham for a\nfun-filled day of paint, sweat\nand mud! I, in my infinite wis-dom, decided to travel up the\nprevious night and sleep a\nmere 20 minutes away from\nthe site... only to receive a\n\u2018wake-up call\u2019 from the club\npresident at 5.30am! That\nguaranteed him a little friendly fire later in the day.\nUpon arrival, we were\ngreeted with the site of hundreds of other obviously quite\nsick people looking for a day\nof running around in the\nwoods and getting shot at.\nThe team were all issued with\nsome very fashionable over-alls, a standard Tippmann 98\npaintball marker (we don\u2019t\nuse guns, for all you PC people out there) and a rather\nhefty bag of 500 paintballs to\nget us started.\nAfter a comprehensive\nintroduction to paintball for\nthose who had never played\nbefore, and a safety briefing,\nthe marshals led us deep into\nthe wood, where the games\nbegan. Now, the object of the\ngame is, of course, to eliminate the opposition. One hit\nanywhere on your person or\nequipment and you\u2019re outta\nthere. If a paintball bounces,\nhowever, you\u2019re still in the\ngame. Each team is awarded\nfive points for capturing the\nopposition\u2019s flag and returning it to their home base within the ten minute time limit.\nYou get one point for a draw\n(when no-one captures either\nflag), and no points for a loss.\nOur first match was up\nagainst the hosts of the\ntournament, Birmingham\nUniversity. The field was\ncalled \u2018Beeches\u2019, with a great\ndecommissioned helicopter\nas a large centrepiece. As we\nwere playing on their home\nground and we had a scratch\nteam, we naturally had to\nshow Birmingham what we\nwere made of.\nOur opponents put up an\nadmirable fight until the last\nminute, when a key Imperial\nplayer flanked all the way\naround the left to surprise\nthem, taking out the remains\nof their defence and returning the flag (Imperial 5,\nBirmingham 0). Oh yeah!\nOur morale-boosting start\nwas followed up by a much\nswifter victory on the \u2018Swamp\u2019\nfield against Coventry,\nthen another astounding\nwin against the extremely\nsneaky Southampton team on\n\u2018Rolling Rock\u2019. I think it\u2019s fair\nto say we were definitely on a\nroll by this time.\nAt lunch, we replenished\nall our spent energy with a\nfew delicious burgers and hot\ndogs washed down with some\nsoda \u2013 the true paintball\nathlete\u2019s diet. After maxing\nevery match so far, the talk\naround the water cooler was\nthat we were indestructible.\nEither way, we had already\nsecured our place in the final,\nno matter what the outcome\nof the post-lunch Warwick\nmatch was.\nSo as not to taint our perfect\nrecord, we felt obliged to kick\nsome more ass when taking\non Warwick in the extremely\natmospheric \u2018Temple\u2019 field,\ncomplete with 30ft Aztec\ntemple and thick brush! It\nwas close, but no cigar for\nWarwick. The standings after\nthe heats were as follows,\nwith every team getting an\nextra five points for a \u2018bye\u2019\ngame:\nImperial 25\nBirmingham 16\nSouthampton 16\nCoventry 10\nWarwick 5\nFollowing all of the\nheats, Southampton and\nCoventry battled it out for\nthird and fourth place, with\nSouthampton coming out\non top. Then came the final\ndecider, Imperial versus\nBirmingham (cue atmospheric fight scene music). We\nunknowingly chose \u2018Bridges\u2019\nas the field to play, not realising that Birmingham had\nalready stormed Warwick\non that same field earlier in\nthe day! It was a very close\nmatch, with members of both\nteams being taken out left\nright and centre. However,\njust as our left flank was about\nto break through to grab\nBirmingham\u2019s flag and claim\nvictory, the whistle blew and\nit was all over. Birmingham\nhad made a strong flanking\nmanoeuvre down the opposite\nside, breaking through our\ndefence and snatching our\nflag without us even realising\nit. Imperial 0, Birmingham 5.\nAll in all, an awesome day\nwas had by all, and it was\na great start to the year for\nICU-PAIN.\nThe event was proudly\nsponsored by Just Paintball,\nwho provided a new pair of\ngoggles to each of the players in the first placed team!\nThe second placed team\n(Imperial) received over\n\u00a3100 in vouchers for the Just\nPaintball shop (we have some\nnew team jerseys on the\nway!)\nA big thank you goes out\nto all the teams, particularly\nBirmingham for arranging\nthe great day. Thanks also\nto the Birmingham lads and\nPortsmouth dude who helped\nus to make up numbers.\nIf you\u2019d like to try your hand\nat paintball then we will hopefully be organising monthly\nevents from now on, the\nfirst being on Wednesday 9\nFebruary. Please see www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/rcc/PAIN for\nmore information or email\nalexander.jermstad@ic.ac.uk.\nICU\u2013PAIN\nPaintball team storm Birmingham\nWar has never been so much fun: Imperial\u2019s paintballers pose for the camera pre-battle\nSoon all this could be yours (hat not included)\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005\nFEATURES felix@ic.ac.uk\nInterested in development work?\nAlex McCredie explains how you can help developing communities across the world\n15\nWhy would anyone want to\ngo to the back of beyond, to\na disease-ridden, high crime,\ncorrupt country to work?\nWe are all well aware of\nthe awful tsunami aftermath,\nand many of us may wonder\nwhether we could possibly\nhelp out some way. You may\nthink it is beyond your ability to help in any way except\nfinancially, but you might be\nwrong there. I don\u2019t know\nmuch about the specific situ-ation, or what it is like out\nthere; I only observed the\ndrastic news from the comfort of the lovely new sofa in\nmy father\u2019s sitting room on\nBoxing Day. But it did get me\nthinking about relief and aid\nin general, and I do have a\nfew things to say about engineers\u2019 role in such disasters\nand also development work. I\nam also going to tell you about\nEngineers Without Borders\nUK, a student organisation,\nof which there is a branch at\nImperial.\nDisaster relief is very different to continual development\naid. There are special contingency funds for disaster relief.\nThey need the money desperately before whole sections of\ncountries suffer. RedR stands\nfor Registered Engineers for\nDisaster Relief-they are a\ncharity which provides engineers to aid agencies in the\nevent of a disaster and they\nhave of course been very busy\nrecently. Good engineers are\nalso essential to the development of a country. Continual\ndevelopment aid is different\nand given for a variety of different reasons.\nThere is so much controversy around delivering aid.\nWhat is our responsibility\nas rich educated engineers\nto the developing world?\nShould they be encouraged\nto develop with some help, or\nshould we be freely handing\nout donations because they\nare poor and cannot manage?\nShould we just give money,\nor provide human resources\nto sort out their problems\nas well?\nPeoplesometimesassociate\naid with colonialism and the\npower of the rich donor countries over the poverty ridden\nones, including third world\ndebt, sweatshops and the\nindustrialisation that brought\nthe need for development. Is\nit our governments\u2019 fault? Is\nit pure human brotherly love\nthat wills us to help out these\ncountries, or is there an element of guilt and responsibility involved?\nThere is, of course, the\nabundant humane will to help\nthe poor and starving, and we\nrecognise our social responsi-bility, but not enough. I think\nquite a lot of people are very\nconcerned about the third\nworld when they are young,\nbut when they grow up and\nrun their own businesses and\ngovernments, self preservation and profits surpass caring for poor countries.\nHowever, we are living in\na wealthy aid-giving country,\nand therefore we can afford\nto give aid without denting\nourselves at all. Hence the\nreal reason we give aid is\nprobably shielded. The reason we give aid is presented\nas goodwill and pure generos-ity. But, logically and econom-ically, self preservation of our\ncountry is more important.\nDo we (as a country) give aid\nbecause we have some kind\nof interest in these countries,\nor some guilt from the past?\nWhy don\u2019t we completely\nwipe out their debt? Giving\naid may make a particular\npolitical party appear generous and caring, but their real\nambition, as it should be, is to\nmake Britain a better place,\nnot Tanzania.\nI am being quite cynical.\nI just think that more aid\nshould be given and it easily\ncould be. Many governments\nsigned up to the millennium\ndevelopment goals. These are\nan ambitious set of environ-mental, health and education\ntargets that include halving\nthe proportion of people without access to safe drinking\nwater by 2015. It is already\n2005 and we are nowhere\nnear these targets.\nOf course, there are many\npeople who care and understand the responsibility\nwe have for the developing\nworld. Some people act on\nthis responsibility and want\nto take charge of how aid\nis delivered. They are using\ntheir skills to design refugee\ntents, predict earthquakes,\nmake available their structural engineering skills to\nbuild houses, find water in\nthe desert, design emergency\ntimber bridges, teach, provide medical care, design\nwebsites for charities, etc.\nThey are not blighted by\nthe bad pay or poor working\nconditions; they even find it\nexciting. Of course, no-one is\ngoing to change the world, or\neven aim to. They just want to\ndo their bit and make a small\ndifference.\nDelivering aid is also a very\ndifficult task. Making sure it\nends up in the right place\nfor a start is difficult enough,\nbut whether it is successful\nis another issue. We can see\nthat the relief aid efforts in\nIndonesia are proving to be a\nhuge logistical problem.\nMistakes have been made in\nthe past concerning the delivery of aid. In India, for exam-ple, charity fitted toilets and\nrunning water were installed\nin some slum houses, but\nas soon as it was done, the\noccupants sold their houses\nand went back to living in\nthe slums. The general policy\nnow is that one does not just\ngive out aid; the recipients\nare made to work for it, or\npay for some of it. This instils\nownership, pride and responsibility over the donation. It\nis imperative that these suffering people also know that\nwe rich, educated westerners care. This was demonstrated to me last summer\nwhen I went with an Imperial\nCollege group to El Salvador\nto help construct houses in\nan earthquake-damaged vil-lage. It wasn\u2019t the physical\nwork we were doing that was\nimportant to them, it was our\nmere presence and mucking in, which showed that we\ncare and meant so much to\nthem. It spurred them on to\nbuild their own houses.\nIt must be known that these\nplaces exist and that we do\nhave a responsibility to these\npoor people. It can be argued\nthat their government should\nbe responsible, but in many of\nthese places, getting money\nfor a water supply for their\nvillage from their government is like getting blood out\nof a stone.\n\u201cThe answer is not more\ncharity or NGO projects.\nWater and sanitation is not a\nmatter for charity. They are\nessential for human health\nand development.\u201d (Clare\nShort, 2003).\nWell-intentioned projects\nfunded by short-term aid\nrecipes often fail. Ms Short\nwas right in saying that it is a\nmatter for major investment\nby publicly owned companies,\nbut it doesn\u2019t always work\nout that way either. She was\nmore realistic when she said\nwe need to concentrate on\nsharing expertise and using\naid to speed up investment\nin sustainable systems that\nallow reasonable charges and\nensure that services are provided to the poor.\nDevelopment work is\nextremely interesting and\nchallenging, and can take you\nall over the world. High levels of enthusiasm, experience\nand knowledge are normally\nrequired. This is normally\nvery difficult. It is a bit of a\ncatch 22 situation \u2013 you can\u2019t\nget experience unless you\nhave it. But why shouldn\u2019t\nyounger, inexperienced people be able to help if they\nwant to? Surely younger people would be ideal, as they\nhave more energy, less fear,\nmore enthusiasm, and are\nnot yet bothered about settling down in one place and\nstarting a family.\nEngineers Without Borders\nUK (EWB) is a student-run\ncharity that aims to make\navailable the engineering\nskills and knowledge of university students to developing communities. It achieves\nthis by working with partner\nNGOs (non-governmental\norganisations) and sending students on placements\nwith them over the summer\nholidays. EWB coordinates\nresearch projects for technologies that will benefit\ndeveloping world communities and provides bursaries to\nstudents taking up their own\nprojects that are appropriate\nto EWB\u2019s aims.\nSecondly, our aim is to raise\nawareness and satiate curiosity about international devel-opment. EWB UK operates\nby having a core branch in\nCambridge and branches at\nother universities. The EWB\nImperial College Branch was\nfoundedlastyear.EWBorgan-ises talks on international\ndevelopment and appropriate technologies every other\nweek at Imperial College.\nEWB has 36 engineering\nrelated placements available\nthis summer (but not just for\nengineers) in countries ranging from India, Sri Lanka,\nNepal and Nigeria to the UK\nand Spain.\nEWB Imperial College\nBranch is organising a training weekend from Friday 4\nMarch to Sunday 6 March,\nfor students who are interested in going on a placement\nor interested in development\nwork. The training weekend\nwill include talks and activities aiming to equip students\ngoing on placements with\nsome extra skills and knowledge that will help them in\na developing world environ-ment. It will also raise awareness of some of the issues\ninvolved such as health and\nsafety, and will ensure that\nthe student is more prepared\nfor the work and what to\nexpect.\nVisit www.union.ic.ac.uk/\nscc/ewb for more details.\nEngineers Without Borders, an Imperial club/society, sends students on development\nprojects throughout the world.

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nStraight away I feel should say I am\nnot usually a hardcore hard house\nfan, which is obvious just from looking at me. I like my house, funky\nor dirty. I am a hard house virgin\nas far as clubbing goes, and I do\nnot take kindly to pilled up cyber\nkids screaming at me \u201cYeah, fucking\nyeah, this is... yeah!\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s on the bus on the way\nthere. They really need to calm\ndown, I think it\u2019s all that nylon in\ntheir fluffy boots. So, as you can\nimagine, I was dreading it just a bit,\nbut my boyfriend was well up for\nit, so I had to at least pretend to be\ninterested.\nI\u2019ve been to Turnmills before for\nCity Loud, and as far as venues go\nit\u2019s alright, but nowhere near the\nleague of Pacha or Caf\u00e9 de Paris.\nThe music played doesn\u2019t lend itself\nto a bit of class and clean carpets.\nTurnmills is like someone took\nFabric, gave it a bath and sent it\nto school to learn how to work in\nMcDonalds (as opposed to robbing\ncars). You go there expecting a bit\nof dirt, all in a good way. Extreme\nEuphoria is a very appropriate\nnight to be held there \u2013 generally\nhard house fans aren\u2019t usually too\nworried about the cleanliness of a\nvenue; they prefer the dark places\nas they hide all their pill taking.\nNow the few of you out there that\ndon\u2019t do pills, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not\nreferring to you. Chavs generally\ntend to go straight for the alcopops.\nI\u2019m joking, of course \u2013 not everyone\nwho goes to hard house nights is\na chav or a pillhead. In fact, I got\nasked about my abilities to supply\nfar less at Turnmills than I did when\nI went to Asda in Clapham at 2am.\nBack in Turnmills, the mix of people was quite surprising. You had\neverything from your staple diet of\ncybers, thrash-heads and the random middle aged men who just\nappear at these events. Everyone\nwas really friendly and loved up.\nWink-wink, nudge-nudge, need I say\nmore?\nWhen I was chatting to this girl in\nthe queue, I was a bit surprised to\nfind out that she was studying for\nher bar exams and this other couple had kids and lived in Chiswick.\nIt takes all sorts I guess, which is\nreally what clubbing is all about \u2013 to\nget beyond all that bullshit of pigeon\nholing.\nThe guy to girl ratio did start to\nresemble an Imperial outing until\nI found the back room, the funky\nroom. This is one thing that tends\nnot to change no matter where\nyou go \u2013 generally girls (I do mean\nvery generally) tend to prefer the\nfunky room as it is far less mad and\nsweaty, so their make-up doesn\u2019t\nrun. Overall the night was about\n60% men, which isn\u2019t too bad, and\nthe girls who were properly dancing their tits off in the main room\nto Anne Savage were a right laugh.\nOne girl even dared me to moon the\nDJ booth. I mean, I was tempted\nuntil she just decided I was taking\ntoo long and did it herself. Security\narrived and told her to calm down.\nDrinks in Turnmills are expensive\n\u2013 you\u2019re looking to pay about \u00a32.50\nfor a bottle of water or a coke and\nabout \u00a34.50 for a beer. If you\u2019re going\nout in London to one of the big clubs\nyou expect to pay a lot, so I wasn\u2019t\ntoo surprised. The bar staff aren\u2019t\nthe friendliest of people either at\nTurnmills, but I think it\u2019s due to\nthe fact that everyone kept hassling\nthem for free glasses of water. Why\nclubs don\u2019t just hand them out freely\nI don\u2019t know, and what\u2019s even worse\nis that some bar staff will give it to\nyou but some are very strict.\nThe high cost of drinks didn\u2019t seem\nto stop people having a good time,\nand the bar was packed three deep\nmost of the night. Turnmills is most\ncertainly very popular on Saturday,\nwhich is probably due to the success\nof the Extreme Euphoria CD range\nfrom Anne Savage.\nI had a lot of negative expectations\nas you must have guessed by now\nabout the whole night \u2013 it was everything I thought I didn\u2019t like about\nclubbing. I really had a good time, so\nfor those who fancy something a bit\nhardcore, give it a go.\nGetting back home is a bit of an\narse though, so the euphoria may\nwear off when you\u2019re stood at a bus\nstop with one of the few pilled up\nchavs who got in telling you how\ngreat the night was and how they\u2019ve\nmet Anne Savage, blah blah blah...\nAlright, I get it, I was there, I don\u2019t\nneed to be told over and over and\nover again. Go do yourself a favour\nand steal a car.\nAaron Mason\nExtreme Euphoria\nCyber kids, thrashers and middle aged men. These are the kind of people you find at a\nnight like Extreme Euphoria. Oh, and Felix reviewers too...\nExtreme Euphoria\nTurnmills\nHHHHI\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nClockwise from top left: BK, Anne Savage, and the Euphoria crowd\n333: not the magic number\nCLUB REVIEW\nA short review about a short visit.\nI don\u2019t recommend going out when\nyou are ill \u2013 you make some of\nthe worst decisions. Such an\nevent happened to me on Sunday\nnight.\nMy friend Mike and I decided we\nshould try new and exciting pas-tures. This idea led us to 333 in Old\nStreet, we think.\nThis is where some of the problems occur. We aren\u2019t too sure\nwhere we went as there were two\nentrances next to each other, but we\nthink we went into 333. So, bearing\nthis in mind if you do want to go to\n333, make sure you check which\nentrance it is.\nA quick rundown of the place:\ndrinks were expensive considering there was no proper flooring in\nthe place, and the basement room\nactually had whole chunks of the\nfloor missing. It was an interesting experience, to say the least; I\nsaw where heroin addicts go out\nand have sex in the toilets. Oh yes.\nI also saw one of the worst drag\nqueens ever; she didn\u2019t even bother\nto shave. I think this may well have\na been a \u2018look\u2019 but when combined\nwith an eighties red leather skirt-suit I don\u2019t think \u2018look\u2019 quite covers\nit. I think \u2018frightening\u2019 is a better\nword.\nThe whole night was quite a laugh.\nI think it was more to do with the\nfact that Mike had decided to buy a\nlittle bottle of absinthe and drink it\nat a bus stop, but a fun night is still\na fun night.\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend Monster\nbut I have heard high reviews of\nother nights at 333.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nTo pay or not to pay\nCouncil tax is an issue that comes\nup from time to time in this line of\nwork. There is often some confusion\nfrom some students around whether\nthey should pay it or not, which in\nmany cases is just down to the students not being aware of the official\nline. Hopefully the rest of this article\nwill help to set the record straight.\nStudents are not automatically\nexempt from council tax, though in\ncertain circumstances the property\nmay be. Your liability for council tax\ndepends on whether you are deemed\nto be a full-time student, where you\nlive and with whom you live.\nThe definition of a student for\nexemption purposes is: \u201cYou are\nstudying full time at a UK institution if you are enrolled on a course\nfor the \u2018relevant period\u2019 which lasts\nfor at least one academic year; you\nare attending at least 24 weeks per\nyear; the course requires at least 21\nhours of term time study per week;\nand you are studying at a prescribed\neducational establishment.\u201d\nThe \u2018relevant period\u2019 starts on the\nday you begin your course and ends\non the day you officially finish, and\nincludes holidays which fall in that\ntime. If you permanently leave your\ncourse, the relevant period will be\nuntil the last day you study.\nUniversity halls of residence\nHalls of residence are automatically\nexempt from council tax and therefore you will not receive a bill. \u2018Halls\nof residence\u2019 is taken to mean any\naccommodation that is \u2018owned or\nmanaged by an educational establishment\u2019 and predominantly for the\naccommodation of students. If you\nhave any difficulty with this, please\ncontact the Information and Advice\nCentre.\nHouse occupied solely by\nstudents\nWhere all the residents of a house\nare full time students (according\nto definition), the property is classified exempt from council tax. In\nthis situation, all residents in the\nhouse will need to get a council\ntax exemption certificate from the\nCollege Registry.\nHouses in multiple\noccupation\nThese are houses where each room\nis let out separately under different\nletting agreements (for example, a\nhouse converted into bedsits where\nsome facilities are shared).\nThe landlord is liable to pay the\ncouncil tax on the whole property\nand cannot pass the bill directly to\nthe tenants. The landlord can, how-ever, include this cost as a proportion of the rent.\nYou will need to look at your\ntenancy agreement to see how\nthe landlord has distributed liability and if necessary seek advice on\nyour tenancy agreement from the\nInformation and Advice Centre.\nResident landlords\nWhere you lodge with your landlord,\nit is (s)he who is liable to pay council\ntax. Your landlord cannot ask you to\npay any of the bill directly, but (s)he\nmay have included some of the cost\nin your rent.\nHouses with student and non-student residents (aged 18+)\nIn cases where there is only one\nresident who is not a full time stu-dent, a 25% single person discount\napplies. Where there is more than\none non-student resident, the property becomes liable for the full council tax bill. Once this is ascertained,\nit is then up to the house as a whole\nhow they want to pay the bill.\nIf the bill is not paid, the council can pursue any resident in the\nhouse for the full bill. This includes\nany one of the student residents.\nWhere one of the residents is\nreceiving state benefits, (s)he may\nbe able to claim council tax benefit.\nExemption certificates\nIt is important to remember that in\norder to get any exemption the local\nauthority will require evidence that\nyou are a student. Exemption certificates are available from Imperial\nCollege Registry.\nThe Information and Advice\nCentre\nIf you have any queries regarding\nthis article or would like to make\nan appointment, don\u2019t let your concern turn into a crisis. Make the\nInformation and Advice Centre your\none-stop shop for all your welfare\nissues. Telephone: 020 7594 8067.\nEmail: advice@ic.ac.uk.

From a South Kensington campus point of view, these are most\nvisible through the construction and\noperation of photovoltaic cells on\nImperial College Road, which look\ngood as well as serving a very useful\npurpose, and the eclectic waste recycling schemes offered by the many\ndifferent departments.\nOne waste collection and recycling scheme, being operated in\nthe Department of Environmental\nSciences, could be expanded to the\nwider college. The response from\nboth students and staff in the DES\nscheme, which is itself run by a\ncommittee of students and staff, has\nbeen amazing and has resulted in\nthe collection of a wide range of\nrecyclables.\nA separate battery collection\nscheme, implemented by the Estates\nDepartment, has already led to the\ncollection of hundreds of batteries\nwhich will be sent for reprocessing.\nOver 30,000 tonnes of batteries are\nused in the UK every year but only\n200 tonnes are collected \u2013 the rest\nare disposed of at landfill sites. And\nthese are products considered to\nhave hazardous contents! Through\nseparate collection, batteries are\ntherefore diverted from landfill, contributing to a reduction in the risks\nposed by such disposal.\nSo there have been some attempts\ntoturnthecollege\u2018green\u2019,butdespite\nthe success of these schemes, they\nare small scale. More needs to be\ndone by all. For Imperial to develop\na reputation as a university with a\ncommitment to sustainability, various measures need to be adopted\nand adhered to, from an ethical/\nenvironmental purchasing policy to\nwaste minimisation strategies and\nrenewable energy purchasing.\nThe day may come when a university\u2019s environmental and ethical impact becomes one of the factors that determines its position in\nthe higher education league tables\nand affects funding opportunities.\nHowever, if these green measures\nare to work, students and staff must\nbe willing to actively participate.\nAfter all, Imperial does have a big\nimpact upon the environment and\nsociety as a whole, particularly as\nstudents move on to future roles\nas managers and leaders (to quote\nfrom HEFCE\u2019s strategy!)\nStart a (green) revolution at\nImperial \u2013 put pressure on the pow-ersthatbetochangeImperialCollege\ninto the most sustainable university\nin England, nay, the world.\nAs you may have heard recently,\nthe College\u2019s plans to redevelop\nSouthside have been granted consent by Westminster Council,\nsubject to several pages worth of\n\u2018conditions\u2019. These are not overly\nonerous but basically require the\nCollege to pay greater attention to\nthings like the landscaping of the\ngardens. This will, of course, be for\nthe benefit of the wealthy residents\nof Knightsbridge, to be funded from\nthe rents of hard-pressed future stu-dents...\nIn addition, the College has to\nfurther develop its \u2018student management plan\u2019 ie show it has the balls to\ndiscipline students who misbehave.\nWith a bit of luck, this means that\ndemolition work should now start,\non time, the week after students\nmove out at the end of the summer\nterm.\nInevitably, people will ask about\nwhere all the student facilities currently in the Southside building will\nmove to, and this is want I want to\n(sort of) focus on.\nThe fitness gym and the sports\nhall are due to be replaced by the\nnew sports centre. However, that\nwill not be ready until late\nNovember, leaving a gap over the\nsummer vacation and at the start\nof next academic year. The Union\nis still involved in discussions with\nthe College as to where the student clubs\u2019 activities will move to\nboth in the short and long term.\nWhilst we would like to try to move\nas much as possible into the new\nsports centre, competing priorities\nmean the College may require us\nto move some to the St Mary\u2019s\ncampus. Similarly, there is an\noutstanding disagreement as to\nwhether the Union free weights gym\nneeds to be replicated.\nThe future of the bar/catering provision at Southside is, inevitably, up\nfor discussion, though with less students living in Princes Gardens (and\nwith both Linstead and Weeks having their own bars) there is less of a\nneed for them in the short term.\nThe College Counsellors will move\nto Sherfield, to be closer to the other\nstudent-facing services there.\nMedical madness\nThat leaves the NHS facilities\n(Health Centre and Dentists\u2019\nPractice), which will move out of\nSouthside into a temporary medical centre next term. This will be\nlocated on the tennis courts next to\nLinstead Hall. (Yes, we shall be losing our tennis courts.)\nWhich brings me on to what I\nreally want to talk about: campus\nmedical facilities. As President I am\na member of the College\u2019s Medicial\nAnd Dental Services Advisory\nCommittee (MADSAC) which oversees the College\u2019s contract with its\nNHS service providers. I\u2019ve actually never attended a meeting. I\u2019ve\nalways sent my Deputy President\n(Education and Welfare) along\ninstead since, until a few weeks\nago, I wasn\u2019t even registered at the\nHealth Centre and had never used\nthe Dentist.\nWith the long-term future of\nthe medical services now under\nconsideration I\u2019d just like to invite\ncomment from readers as to\nwhat they think of the services.\nClearly the Health Centre and\nDentist are necessary, but do they\ndeliver what you expect? Please do\nwrite in to Felix so we can begin the\ndiscussion!\nHow will Southside affect your health?\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\n\n"

    "content": "The follow up to the hit Meet the\nParents (2000) is a light-hearted,\npun-terrific comedy with a sitcom-style finishing cut. The comedy duo\nformed by Stiller and De Niro is\nback in an attempt to recreate the\nsuccess from the previous film, perhaps falling a bit short of achieving the same levels of tear-jerking\nhumour as its predecessor.\nWe rejoin Gaylord Focker (Stiller)\nand his fianc\u00e9e Pam (Polo) as they\narrange for their parents to meet\nbefore their wedding. Unfortunately\nthis involves Pam\u00b4s father, an\nuptight ex-CIA agent (suitably\nplayed by De Niro), meeting with\nthe Fockers, an eccentric couple\ncomposed of a retired lawyer turned\nhippy (Hoffman) and a sex therapist\n(Streisand). Predictably, the mix\nproves to be explosive, so that as\nthe two families spend a weekend\ntogether on Focker Isle, you can\njust sit back, relax and laugh at\nhow someone else has to deal with\nin-laws that would make even yours\nseem the epitome of charm.\nThe film is enjoyable enough, with\na multitude of recurring gags and\ncharacters, targeting mainly an\naudience that has already seen the\nprevious film, a viewing of which\nis definitely recommended before\nscreening these \u201c\u2026 Fockers\u201d.\nThere are plenty of good jokes\nin the movie, enough to keep you\nchuckling away quite happily in\nyour seat. However it never quite\nmanaged to draw a proper roar of\nlaughter from the audience. Most\nof us felt quite safe, without risk of\nhaving soda come out of our noses,\nsomething unusual in Jay Roach\nfilms (also director of the Austin\nPowers series).\nWatching the film produces a\nviewing experience similar to\nwatching several episodes of any\nof your favourite sitcoms in a row.\nThis involves a screenplay that\nmostly fuses quick witted dialogue\nwith slapstick humour in a \u2018real life\u2019\nsituation. The main satisfaction to\nobtain from this film is to find yourself laughing at what could easily\nbe your worst nightmare (your in-laws). On the down side, most gags\ntend to revolve around the same topics (how many Focker jokes could\none think of...?) and therefore end\nup feeling a bit stale towards the end\nof the movie.\nHowever, the casting is brilliant\nand the characters are at ease in\ntheir parts. The on-screen chemistry between Stiller and De Niro is\npalpable. One can easily relate to\nStiller\u2019s nerves about impressing\nhis mistrusting in-laws and laugh at\nhis clumsiness, while sympathetically feeling the burn of De Niro\u2019s\nmenacing eyes.\nBen Stiller is easily maintaining himself well in the spotlight of\nHollywood comedy and has seen\n2004 as one of his most successful\nyears so far.\nDe Niro\u2019s career in the new millennium is also looking alive, as the\nactor experiments with new genres.\nHe can\u2019t help being type-cast as a\ngangster/tough guy resulting from a\nfilmography full of mafia and action\nmovies. It appears, however, that\nrather than slowing him down, he\nis using this portrait to open a door\nto new genres. Comedy films such\nas the Meet the Parents series or\nAnalyse This and That exploit this\nimage fully.\nThe Fockers (Hoffman and\nStreisand) easily mix into the final\nrecipe, along with a bundle of wacky\nside characters, mischievous pets\nand a perverted baby genius to complete the picture.\nOverall, if you liked Meet the\nParents, you will enjoy Meet the\nFockers. It adds new elements to\nthe series and will definitely make\nyou laugh. However, the film leaves\na slight feeling of disappointment\nas the characters and the plot could\nhave been exploited more fully. Too\nmany \u2018Focker\u2019 jokes leave this film a\nbit... well... \u2018Fockered\u2019.\nIgnacio Quinones\nFocking repetitive\nAll hell breaks loose when the Byrnes family meets the Focker family for the first time.

I finally decided on the former; it was just\nthe IC Dramsoc (no offence) level\nof acting and completely unfeasible\nplot that were implying the latter.\nKate (Portenta) misses the last\ntrain while on the way to try to shag\nGeorge Clooney. She misses the\ntrain because she falls asleep on a\nLondon Underground platform. I\u2019m\nnot sure how many girls would fall\nasleep on a urine-stenched platform\nwhile on a mission to bed Clooney.\nBut that\u2019s a minor implausibility in\nthe script compared to other gaping\nholes.\nKate can\u2019t escape out onto the\nstreet, but does manage to discover a homeless person\u2019s hideaway,\na record archive and a backstreet\noperating theatre (with exemplary\nhygiene standards, take note med-ics).

Sounds\ntricky? It probably is!\nIn the evening, the filthy\nminers amongst you can congregate for a bar night organised by your esteemed RSM\ncommittee.\nWednesday 9 February\nIn line with tradition,\nWednesday afternoon brings\nthe London Raid. Anything\ngoes here really. Go around\nLondon collecting cash and\ntrying to complete crazy challenges like floating around\nfountains in a dinghy or tiddly-winking the length of Oxford\nStreet. Join us at the Union in\nSouth Ken afterwards, where\nprizes will be awarded for the\nbest teams and the craziest\nstunts!\nThursday 10 February\nThursday evening brings a\nCity and Guilds Bar Night\nand a slave auction into\nthe ring.

While such technology is often very sophisticated and expensive, it is\nbecoming more widely accessible to normal consumers and enthusiasts. This is\nwhere Mind\u2019s Eye, Imperial\u2019s\nnew CGI society, comes in.\nAs part of a sponsorship\nagreement with Alias, the\nworld\u2019s leading innovator\nof 3D graphics technology,\nand with help from Escape\nStudios, one of Europe\u2019s leading CGI schools, the society will be able to use the\nAcademy Award winning software Maya\u00ae 6. The unlimited version of the software\nincludes Maya Fluid Effects\u2122,\nMaya Cloth, Maya Hair, Maya\nFur and Maya Live, allowing\nthe creation of superior digital content!\nAt the moment, the society\nwill not be providing formal\ntraining for its members, but\nthe idea is that members will\nbe able to learn from more\nexperienced ones through\ndiscussions and the exchange\nof techniques and ideas.\nFurthermore, the society will\nprovide a number of training\nDVDs and books to allow everyone to learn at their own\npace.\nIn addition to learning\nthe world\u2019s most powerful\n3D software, members can\nwork on their own projects\nindividually or in teams.\nMaybe you\u2019ve always wanted\nto work on a game or create an animated short?

    "content": "For the past two hundred\nyears, the opportunity to view\nhuman corpses and their\ninner workings has been\nconfined to the circles of the\nmedical elite. That is, until\nDr Gunther von Hagens came\nalong.\nVon Hagens, the pathologist\nat the heart of the Anatomy\nfor Beginners TV series aired\nlast week, is a man on a mis-sion. His goal is to reveal, in\nminute and gory detail, the\nart of human dissection, and,\nin so doing, to share with the\ngeneral public what he calls\nthe \u201cpoetry of anatomy.\u201d\nThe study of human anatomy is by no means a modern\ninvention. As early as 275BC,\nanatomy was being taught\nby Herophilus in Alexandria,\nEgypt through the use of\nhumandissections.Bythesec-ond century AD, the Greeks\nhad produced a number of\nanatomical works which were\ntranslated into Arabic and\nlater into Latin. In 1235, the\nfirst European medical school\nwas founded at Salerno, Italy\nwhere bodies were publicly\ndissected. In 1510 Leonardo\nda Vinci turned his hand to\nthe study of anatomy and, in\n1543, Andreas Vesalius, arguably the pioneer of modern\nanatomy, created the first precise anatomical drawings.\nBy the 16th century, anatomical theatres were cropping up all over Europe and\npublic autopsies were com-monplace. From 1600 to 1900\nanatomy played an increasingly important role in medical education and research.\nBut with the establishment\nof medical schools, human\ncorpses slowly drifted out of\npublic sight. A new taboo had\nemerged.\nIn 1977, von Hagens invented a mummification technique\nknown as \u2018plastination\u2019 which\npaved the way for breaking that taboo. This process\nreplaces bodily fluids and fat\nwith synthetic polymers which\nsolidify and preserve tissue down to the microscopic\nlevel. At first sight, the bodies\nlook like anatomical models.\nMuscles, organs, the nervous\nsystem,and blood vessels are\nall frozen in time. Plastinated\nbody parts have proved to be\ninvaluable in cross-sectional\nanatomy, pathology and scientific research and can be used\nin conjunction with conventional imaging methods.\nClever science it may be,\nbut is Anatomy for Beginners\ntaking it too far? Before tuning in, I was very sceptical;\nI imagined von Hagens to\nbe some sort of modern-day\nFrankenstein, a macabre\nshowman vying for the attention of the masses. The man\nbehind the \u2018Body Worlds\u2019\nexhibitions, von Hagens is\nno stranger to controversy.\nHis work has been described\nby some as \u201cghoulish and\ndegrading\u201d and has sparked\nfierce ethical debate world-wide.\nBut what I saw was a series\nof well-presented, thought-provoking public lectures that\nmake for great scientific edu-cation. Dr von Hagens and\nfellow-pathologist, Professor\nJohn Lee, take us on a fascinating tour of the human\nbody, making use of live, dead\nand plastinated models. The\nseries was filmed in front of\na studio audience of medical\nstudents and body donors and\nfollows four themes: move-ment, circulation, digestion\nand reproduction. Cadavers\u2019\nfaces were covered in order\nto preserve anonymity. While\nvon Hagens displays his dissecting skills with fervour,\nLee does a marvellous job\nof describing the part of the\nbody we are seeing and how\nit works.\nAdmittedly, it was at times\nstomach-churning stuff.\nWhen von Hagens removes\na man\u2019s entire skin in one\npiece, we are simultaneously\nimpressed and repulsed. The\npenis dissection and skull-chiselling make for pretty\nuncomfortable viewing. At\none point, von Hagens demonstrates the consistency of\nthe brain by dropping a blancmange from a great height. In\nanother lecture he stretches\nseven metres of someone\u2019s\ngut across the studio.\nOne could argue that such\nspectacles are dehumanising\nand degrading, but I would\nhave to disagree. In a culture that televises plastic surgery for our entertainment,\nAnatomy for Beginners\nprovides a fresh insight into\nthe fascinating world of the\nhuman body. I found myself\namazed by many of the sights\nI saw.\nYes, Dr von Hagens is a performer who cuts up corpses\nwith relish, but, in his own\nwords, he \u201cbreaks with the\ntradition of Frankenstein.\u201d\nVon Hagens emerges as an\nartist and educator, who takes\npride in his work and whose\ngoal is to share the wonder of\nhuman anatomy with professionals and laypeople alike.\nProgrammes like this allow us\nto marvel at the diversity and\nbeauty of human nature. It\u2019s\nan opportunity to think about\nour attitudes towards health,\nlife and death. In von Hagens\u2019\nown words, it\u2019s a chance to\nsee our \u201cface within.\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005 5\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nGunther von Hagens: dissected a human corpse for television and a live studio audience\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s inside that counts\nAnatomy for Beginners shocked and amazed viewers, with some describing it as \u2018dehumanising\u2019\nand others \u2018fascinating\u2019.

This summer I\nwas assistant editor on a newspaper for an\ninternational Scout camp of 8,000 people, producing a full newsprint edition every day for a\nweek, from the comfort of a field.\nFelix is the best it has ever been. I want to\nbuild upon this success and make it even more\nprofessional, with more and better content\nfrom around the college. As editor I would\nrepeat the survey of last summer, in order to\nget a better idea of what readers want and\nimprove our publication.\nSubject to the survey results I would also\nlike to work directly with clubs & societies\non ways to work together for more contributions about, by and for them. Felix needs to\nimprove its representation of the variety of\nthe Imperial community, with more content\non college life, The Union and its events, and\npersonal opinions of students.\nAs a computing student, I\u2019m in a prime position to improve the use of ICT facilities both\ninside and outside the Felix office, including\nan improved website and online contributions\nsystem.\nI would also endeavour to create a more\nenjoyable working environment for contributors in Felix, and so encourage more people\nto contribute and provide readers with a more\nhumorous and entertaining paper.\nALEKS CORR\nHaving been at Imperial for 4 years, I have\nmet and talked to many people about their\nviews on Imperial College and the Union. I\nhave also had first hand experience in using\nthe welfare facilities, and feel that I can represent these views.\nI will strengthen the relationships between\npersonal tutors and students by ensuring that\nthrough regular meetings (not just with first\nyears) a tutor can build up a relationship that\nwill allow the student to ask freely about education and welfare issues, and allow feedback\nfor work/exams. New tutors may need help in\nproviding them the right information.\nPostgraduates and taught postgraduates do\nnot have a huge active role in the Union. Many\npostgraduates do not realise that there is a\nUnion. I can increase awareness by providing information at the start of the year for all\npostgraduates, including the ones originating\nfrom Imperial College.\nI feel that a disinterest in Imperial is due to\nlack of communication. I aim to work alongside student representatives to pass on information through class representatives and create a feedback system.\nI will investigate whether there are enough\nresources to facilitate disabled students, and\nthose with learning difficulties, and to provide\nnecessary changes, by working alongside the\nDisabilities Officer.\nI would like to see more subject areas introducing reading weeks, or more time for preparation round exam times. I feel that this will\ndecrease the stress that student\u2019s feel, especially as preparation time has decreased in\ncertain times of the year.\nSARAH KHATIB\nRUPERT NEATE\nVote Rupert Neate for Felix Editor\nFelix is out of touch with you, the students.\nFelix isn\u2019t fun anymore, and doesn\u2019t attempt to\ncover any serious news stories. Felix should\nconcentrate on its core principles of relevant\nnews, funny columns, opinion on major issues\n& College sport.\n\u25cf More fun, more comedy (bring back page\n3?)\n\u25cf More real news \u25cf More opinion\n\u25cf More sport \u25cf More relevance\nFelix should be full of stuff you want to\nread! Felix shouldn\u2019t just be something you\nflip through when you\u2019re bored in lectures,\nit should be something you look forward to,\nsomething that sparks debate, or at least\nconversation. The current bland Felix only\nprovokes the question \u201cWhat\u2019s 7 across?\u201d.\nWe spend all our time learning about science in lectures, Felix should be a reprieve\nfrom this, do we really want to read about only\nScience and Business? I\u2019m not suggesting\nFelix should be dumbed-down; I will introduce\nhumour and serious hard-hitting articles. I\u2019ll\ninclude an agony aunt (everyone loves reading them!) and a London sport column.\nFelix is very un-opinionated, there is no\nleader column, all papers need this to express\nthe paper\u2019s views. I have secured interviews\nwith prominent politicians such Westminster\nMP\n, Mark Fields, and will regularly interview\na figure relevant to students.\nI have been published in The Reading\nEvening Post and The Southampton Daily\nEcho, and had work experience on The\nGuardian.\nVote Rupert for a Felix you want to read\nDARIUS NIKBIN\nFelix is your forum. We are there to enter-tain, inform, and to publish your views. Most\nimportantly Felix must be relevant and it is\nthe Editor\u2019s responsibility to print what you\nfind interesting and entertaining.\nDuring my three years on Felix I have\nedited the Film section, written news articles,\nrelaunched the Science section, and been\ninvolved in unearthing the biggest front-page\nscoop Felix\u2019s history. Currently, I am the science editor and am working to launch a new\nFelix spinout magazine in March. I also have\nexperience on the advertising and financial\naspects of producing the newspaper.\nThroughout my time on the paper I have\nplaced emphasis on two aspects of Felix:\ncontent and humour. The two are not mutually exclusive, but are essential. Felix needs\nan editorial team who are familiar with the\ncollective student Zeitgeist and who can tap\ninto your sense of banter. Today\u2019s Felix Editor\nalso needs the experience and technical professionalism to safeguard your freedom of\nspeech, motivate a competent editorial team,\nand ensure that Felix is printed on time, and\nnot on bog-roll.\nAs Felix\u2019s most experienced section editor, I\nbelieve I can deliver on all these fronts.\nVote for me and I will ensure the professional running of Felix, support clubs and\nUnion events, publish a once-a-term science\nand culture magazine, revamp the website,\nand guarantee your freedom of speech. Felix\nwill reach its potential, but we need to be\nrelevant in our content and more irreverent\nin our humour.\nMARTIN SMITH\nWhen it comes to editing Felix, you need\nsomeone with both vision and experience. As\nyour Felix editor, I would build on the professionalism already present and introduce a\nnew \u2018feel\u2019 to Felix: one that is interesting,\ninformative and amusing. I will:\n\u25cf Extend the already excellent sports coverage to every club and society by offering\n\u2018feature\u2019 sections on the interesting social,\nrecreational, overseas and athletic aspects of\nstudent life. I\u2019ll continue to print any sports\nreport that I receive.\n\u25cf Encourage comment and lively debate on\ncollege, student and world news, giving every\nreader the chance to make their voice heard\n\u25cf Produce well designed, entertaining issues\nof Felix incorporating many aspects of talent\navailable at Imperial, be it photography, political cartoons or the written word.\n\u25cf Reward and encourage the many talented\ncontributors to Felix with bar nights and other\nsocial events.\nI\u2019m honoured to have served you as the\ncurrent Books editor of Felix and have tackled both interviews and page layout in this\ncapacity, alongside writing some of the cryptic\ncrosswords you enjoyed last year. Some of\nyou may already know me as the editor of\n\u2018Broadsheet\u2019, the Faculty of Physical Sciences\nstudent newspaper. I\u2019m proud to have had\nthat opportunity to offer entertainment and\namusement to Physical Scientists and to produce thought provoking articles on a variety\nof subjects.\nIf you want to see features, comment,\ndebate and other entertaining articles then\nvote Martin Smith for Felix Editor\nwww.martin2005.co.uk\nI am Sarah Khatib, a final year Biochemistry\nstudent.\nI have been a Year Representative for the\npast 2 years and I have enjoyed it because,\nat heart, I like to assist students with their\nacademic issues, and convey their ideas and\ncomplaints to faculty members.\nI strongly believe that you should have the\npower to change things in your university and\nin order to achieve this I will guarantee you\ncompetent representation. I intend to galvanize the departmental representation system\nso that you have more faith in your Year Reps.\nHow often do you meet with your personal\ntutor? Seldom, I bet. I will ensure this scheme\nis more effective, with tutors as your first point\nof reference.\nUnrealistic deadlines, very little time? I want\nto develop a more manageable exam and\ncoursework timetable for all departments.\nI intend to work hard to protect your inter-ests, ensuring that The Union provides you\nwith welfare support specific to your needs.\nIn my position as DPEW, I will address\nthe issue of accommodation rents. I support\nan even distribution of rent increases across\nthe spectrum of halls and I feel that freshers\nhave the right to indicate what price range is\naffordable for them. Above all, I am seeking to\nadvocate a fair accommodation system.\nDo you want to see it all done?\nSpeak Out.\nVote Sarah Khatib for DPEW.\n\n"

Captain Mark Shatwell\ndropped his 4-5-1 \u2018continental\u2019 formation and opted for a\nvery traditional 4-4-2 system\ninstead.\nNews was received that\nUCL could only field nine\ninitial starting players, due\nto injuries, with one player\nshortly to arrive. However,\nafter kick off, the false sense\nof security led to a few nervous moments for Imperial\nearly on. This was short lived\nthough, as the Thirds began\nto improve after 15 minutes\nof play, when the first real\nchance of the game came.\nThe move started with\nDominic Booth picking up\nthe ball and playing it down\nto Leon Thorne on the right\nwing. Thorne skilfully collected the ball and sent a long\npass to striker Perry Deu,\nwho brought down the ball\nand whipped in a cross which\nwas narrowly missed by the\nhard-working Matt Gready.\nThe resultant play led to a\ncorner, and Thorne whipped\na precise cross to find an\nunmarked Gready, who gave\nImperial College a deserved\nlead by hooking a shot past\nthe bewildered UCL goal-keeper.\nAs the match wore on,\nmore success for Imperial\ncame down the right wing,\nwith Deu and Thorne linking\nwell to create many a break\nthrough the UCL defence.\nThe arrival of the tenth\nUCL player made no real dif-ference, as a long ball from\nBooth was controlled by\nPerry, who flicked the ball\nover the marking defender\nand then swivelled past a\nsecond man. Nakamoto collected the ball, and the resulting shot shaved the crossbar.\nAdam Williams and Anthony\nMaule ensured that Imperial\nCollege kept their guard up\nuntil half time with their\naerial dominance. The now\nlegendary dolphin back four\nof Shatwell, Ruso, Booth and\nTom Trump ensured Imperial\nCollege feared no real danger\nby \u2018beefing\u2019 out any attacks\nand performing the odd\n\u2018really big kick\u2019 or handball\nfor good measure.\nThe second half saw\nchanges. John Slavin was\nbrought on for the injured\nGready, and Hasan Iqbal\nreplaced Adam Williams. The\nhalf started vibrantly, as UCL\nhad to attack.\nImperial College seemed\nin control of the match, but\na long clearance from UCL\ndefence caught goalkeeper\nLester napping, the resulting\nlong clearance bounced awkwardly and the UCL striker\nseemed to punch the ball\ninto the net. The referee saw\nnothing wrong, and the goal\nstood.\nWith the score tied, Imperial\nCollege now needed to push\nfor the lead again, which\ncame courtesy of Deu. Iqbal\npicked out Thorne on the\nwide left, who crossed into\nthe area. Deu flicked the ball\nover his marker then over a\nsecond defender, before driving the ball past the UCL\nkeeper, capping off a brilliant\nImperial College move.\nThis instant reply led to\nwave upon wave of attacks,\nwhich ravaged the UCL\ndefence. The third goal came\nshortly afterwards, when\nNakamoto scored a brilliant\nindividual goal, picking up\nthe ball, skipping past two\ndefenders and striking the\nball from the edge of the area\ninto the top corner.\nThorne decided to match\nNakamoto, by picking up\nthe ball on the edge of the\narea, cutting inside past two\nplayers and striking the ball\npast the UCL \u2018keeper into\nthe roof of the net. The score\nwas now 4-1 and Imperial\nCollege began to enjoy\nthemselves.\nGoal number five came from\nbrilliant work from Iqbal, who\n\u2018beefed\u2019 past the UCL midfield to pick out Deu on the\ncorner of the 18 yard area,\nwho then drilled the ball first\ntime into the UCL net.\nThe sixth goal came courtesy of Dominic Booth, again\nafter good work by Iqbal.\nTo round off an all-round\ngreat game, Nakamoto\nbroke down the right wing\ninto the UCL penalty area,\nthen unselfishly cut the ball\nback for the onrushing Deu\nto complete his hat-trick and\nproduce a man of the match\nperformance.\nKeeping his eye on the ball: striker Perry Deu (back row, centre) is distracted at the vital moment, but that didn\u2019t stop\nhim scoring a hat-trick in Imperial Thirds\u2019 7-1 thrashing of UCL last week\nFOOTBALL\n\n"

    "content": "The theatre has never shied away\nfrom showcasing some of the worst\nand most disturbing facets of human\nnature. Some plays will be comical,\nwhile others will be of a somewhat\nless cheery disposition. While The\nAnniversary definitely falls into the\nfirst category, Festen most certainly\ndoes not.\nCurrently showing at the Lyric\nTheatre on Shaftesbury Avenue,\nFesten is an interesting piece of\ntheatre. The play is an adaptation\nof the recent Danish movie of the\nsame name and tackles some really very unpleasant subject matter.\nNot being particularly well versed\nin Danish cinema (though I did see\na rather funny Danish movie this\nsummer, but I can\u2019t remember its\nname at all), I can\u2019t really say how\nwell the adaptation has been carried out. However, from the general\ndescription of the movie that I got\nfrom a friend, the play did seem to\ncapture the feel of the film appro-priately.\nThe script was well acted out by\nthe cast, and the staging worked\nwell. The story focuses on some\nrather disturbing revelations made\nat a birthday party, hence the title\nFesten. We are at the 60th birthday\ncelebrations of a respected gentle-man, successful businessman and\nloving father, when his youngest\nson begins to toast to his father\u2019s\nhealth with some very unsettling\nstories. What ensues is a harrowing\nevening for the family as they try to\nsilence the \u2018crazy\u2019 son and become\nincreasingly inebriated. Eventually\nthe truth is revealed by a posthumous letter.\nWhile the subject matter may not\nbe the most savoury in nature, the\nplay is certainly enjoyable, not something that I could say about another\nplay with similarly disturbing central theme, The Goat. Fortunately\nThe Goat has now moved on, and\nFesten will continue to run until the\nstart of April.\nOn an unrelated note, a new\nexhibition has opened at the Royal\nAcademy. Turks has received rave\nreviews from the national press, and\nI hope also from myself as soon I get\nround to seeing it. The exhibition is\nhoused in the Academy\u2019s main galleries and is accompanied by what\nsound like a good selection of lec-tures, courses and ancillary exhib-its. Late opening has been extended\nnow to encompass Saturday evenings too, and a selection of mezze\nare available to enhance the Turkish\nexperience at the restaurant. And if\nyou are feeling like you really want\nto get into the whole Turkish thing,\nthe Royal Academy have made an\narrangement with Sofra restaurants\nto offer a discount on a meal with an\nexhibition ticket.\nTo find out more details about\nthis exhibition and the associated\nevents, go to the Royal Academy\u2019s\nwebsite www.royalacademy.org.uk.\nFrom this site you can follow a link\nto the special Turks website and get\na sneak preview of the exhibition.\nTickets are \u00a38 for students, and yes,\nthat is a lot, but it\u2019s a lot cheaper\nthan going to Turkey.\nHaving been \u2018encouraged\u2019 to attend\nby various friends and Felix con-tributors, I took my seat in an audience of around 100 for Dramsoc\u2019s\nfirst ever pantomime. On the basis\nof the confident acting, the frequent\naudience laughter and some superb\ncomedy performances, I\u2019m sure it\nwon\u2019t be their last.\nYou can\u2019t have a pantomime without a dame, and Siegfried Hodgson\ngave a wonderfully funny performance as Widow English, Jack\u2019s\nmother. Towering above the rest of\nthe cast, the Widow (of course) sent\nJack away to sell a cow.\nJack, confidently played with\nmuch thigh-slapping by Charlotte\nCoales, returned with the obligatory magic beans, climbed the beanstalk and returned with more than\nenough gold to pay the rent. But\nthat\u2019s where the similarity with the\n\u2018traditional\u2019 storyline ended.\nThis production introduced a surprisingly normal-sized couple of\ngiants to the mix, together with\ntheir guards, a dysfunctional royal\nfamily and a completely useless\nservant called Stammers.\nThe prerequisite panto baddie,\nWitch Whey (Brooke Milburn), was\njoined in most scenes by an unusual addition \u2013 the rapping Wizard\nWheeze (Iain Heaton), whose comical delivery went down well with\nthe audience.\nFor me, the real highlights were\ntwo unscripted moments in the second half. Firstly, a pyrotechnic at\nthe front of the stage exploded and\nthen failed to extinguish itself, so\nSimon (Jack\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend,\nplayed by Richard Jordan) walked\nover and calmly blew it out. Then,\njust after a set change, a cloud\nmagically appeared at the bottom of\nthe beanstalk. \u201cThat\u2019s a funny place\nfor a cloud,\u201d said Simon, before\nthrowing it (and a wayward bomb)\noff the stage.\nThe inclusion of a song near the\nend of the show, though traditional,\nwas probably a mistake. But this\nwas a pantomime and fun was the\naim, so any other shortcomings\ndidn\u2019t really matter.\nIt\u2019s always good to see Imperial\nstudents show off their more \u2018arty\u2019\ntalents. Going by this production,\nDramsoc\u2019s next pantomime comes\nhighly recommended.\nMayhem, both planned and otherwise\nOur intrepid editor Dave Edwards reports back on Dramsoc\u2019s latest venture\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005\n24\nDramsoc presents\nJack and the Beanstalk\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nJack ponders\nlife and the\npursuit of\nhappiness\nIn the school of journalism they\nstress it is important not to start\nan article with an obvious token\nof common knowledge. Forgive me,\nfor I am to break this rule briefly\nto state that theatre is different for\neveryone. Everyone goes to the theatre to see and feel different sights\nand emotions. Passive and active\naudience members alike can rest\nassured that The Anniversary at\nthe Garrick Theatre has something\nfor you.\nThe Anniversary, set in the 1960s\nin South London, refers to the wedding anniversary of Mum and her\nlate husband. The family is together\nto celebrate and disintegrate, for\nMum is a destructive trickster who\ngets off at each horrifying stunt she\ninflicts on her children and in-laws.\nSheila Hancock, who plays Mum\nin this production that runs like one\nlong mother-in-law joke, is delight-ful. She plays the audience like a\nfiddle, and her long-standing experience wafts into the audience.\nMadeline Worrall, playing Shirley,\nTom\u2019s new girlfriend, performs like\nnails on a chalkboard. Her character\nis annoying and her wig is dreadful.\nI wanted terribly to feel sorry for\nher and like her, but it was impos-sible. She is a dramatic actor, not a\ncomedy actor.\nMy favorite female was Rosie\nCavaliero, playing Karen the daugh-ter-in-law. She embodied what it\nfeels like to be an in-law and how\nfrustrating and comical it can be.\nShe gave the play life and character,\nand brought it home to those of us\nwho have experienced being the odd\none out in a family full of nutters.\nThe gentlemen in the production were fantastic. Each of them\nin their place, they made the play\nfun to watch and had a great stage\npresence. My favorite was Liam\nGarrington, who played Tom,\nShirley\u2019s fianc\u00e9. He made an effort\nto connect with the audience and\nhad a special relationship with each\ncharacter on the stage. I wanted to\ntake him and his cute sixties clothing home with me.\nThe set design, by Robin Don,\nmust not go without mention. The\nset is very functional and the room\nthey are in is without a doubt a\nuser-friendly sitting room. Lights\nand sound were spot on and did not\ndetract or add to the play \u2013 they\nserved their purpose, no more, no\nless.\nThis play runs like a sitcom, a very\nlong sitcom, so if you\u2019re looking for a\nrelaxing afternoon or evening of low\nintensity theatre viewing, get your\ntickets now. But if you are looking\nfor a mind-bending and thought-imploring experience, stay at home\nand read a book.\n\u25cf To book tickets for this play, you\ncan call the Garrick Theatre Box\nOffice on 0870 890 1104.\nHowever, if The Anniversary\ndoes not sound like your cup of\ntea, remember that there is a good\ndeal more in town. Have a look at\nthe London Theatre Guide on www.\nlondontheatre.co.uk for a comprehensive listing of what\u2019s on where,\ntheatre information as well as the\nall-important ticket prices and booking details.\n\u201cGoing by this pro-duction, Dramsoc\u2019s\nnext pantomime\ncomes highly\nrecommended\u201d\nThe Anniversary\nGarrick Theatre,\nCharring Cross Road, WC2\nBooking to 16 April 2005\nTickets \u00a315 - \u00a340\nSome more theatre\nand a footnote\nThe Garrick Theatre as it once was.

I soon decided\nthat I wanted to get a Masters\ndegree, so the following year\nI took an MSc in Intelligent\nSystems at Brunel University.\nAfter that, I started a full-time\njob.\u201d\nHow did you get into developing video games?\nDid you have any jobs in\nbetween?\n\u201cMy first job was as a C\nprogrammer at Citibank in\nHammersmith.

After 18 months I got\na graduate job with EDS in\ntheir defence division where\nI worked for over four years.\nThis was really interesting\nwork, and I got on to varied projects and learned a\nlot. Eventually, there came a\ntime when I felt the need to\nmove on and only then did it\noccur to me to combine my\npassion for video games with\nmy skills as a programmer!\nI managed to get into ECTS\nin Earls Court that year and\ncheck out the company that\nmade my favourite games\n(BioWare).

This means\nthat we deal with game rules\nand objects. For instance, the\nfirst thing I worked on was\nthe Encounter System, which\ndetects when the player has\nentered a specific area and\nspawns one or more monsters\nof a level appropriate for the\nplayer to fight. The monsters\nare either a short distance\naway, so that the player eventually comes across them,\nor hidden around a corner\nso that they can ambush the\nplayer. I also collaborated\nwith game designers to work\non the scripting system that\ncontrols the behaviour of the\nmonsters in the game.\nLast year, I did some\nwork on the graphical user\ninterface, and I\u2019m currently\nimplementing combat rules.\nI\u2019ve worked on Neverwinter\nNights, Star Wars: Knights of\nthe Old Republic and a tiny\nbit on Jade Empire, which is\ncoming out soon.

I\ndidn\u2019t always want to go into\nthis job. I only decided on this\ncareer in my final year when\nI found out about the excellent medical physics training\nscheme.\u201d\nWhat did you do after\nyou left Imperial? Did\nyou go straight into the\nNHS?\n\u201cYes, after a summer of travelling I went straight into my\njob in Edinburgh. In order to\nqualify for the grade A trainee\nscheme you need a degree in\nphysics or engineering. They\ndo not necessarily require a\nfirst; a 2:1 is fine. They are\nlooking for people who are\nenthusiastic and will be able\nto work with a whole host\nof different people, including\npatients, medics and techni-cians. I got some experience\nfirst by shadowing a medical\nphysicist at the Charing Cross\nhospital for two days. There\nis tough competition for the\ngrade A training posts, so\nsome medical physics experience (even just two days) will\nstand you in good stead.\u201d\nDo you think being at\nImperial has equipped\nyou well for your future?\n\u201cYes. Degrees from Imperial\nare well respected by employ-ers. Employers want to be\nsure that trainees have a\ngood grounding in the basics\nof physics before they give\nyou more specialist training.\u201d\nCan you give us more\ndetailed info on what\nyour day to day work\ninvolves and the\nprojects you work on?\n\u201cI am currently doing a training placement in the radiotherapy department at the\nWestern General Hospital\nin Edinburgh. This week I\nhave completed the following:\nMonday morning: CT scanner\nfortnightly quality assurance\ntesting. Monday afternoon:\nAs part of my training place-ment, I assisted with the CT\nscanning of patients in preparation for their radiotherapy\ntreatments. Tuesday: This is\nmy MSc day. I commute to\nGlasgow where I have MSc\nlectures. Wednesday morn-ing: Planning of radiotherapy treatments for patients\nwith head and neck can-cer. Wednesday Afternoon:\nPlacement in the mould room\nwhere moulds are taken of\npatients heads so that masks\ncan be made for their treat-ments. Thursday morn-ing: Head and neck treatment planning. Thursday\nafternoon: As part of my\ntraining I went to observe\nthe radiotherapy treatments\nof patients with lung cancer.\nFriday: More quality assurance testing on one of the\nx-ray units plus some experiments concerned with patient\ndoses.\u201d\nCan you tell us more\nabout the training\nscheme that the NHS\nruns for physics\ngraduates?\n\u201cFor the first two years,\ntrainees study part-time for\nan MSc in clinical physics,\nand they will complete three\nplacements in different medical physics departments.\n(For example I will be doing\nradiotherapy, diagnostic x-ray\nand nuclear medicine). The\ntraining scheme is known\nas the \u2018Grade A Training\nScheme,\u2019 and there are about\n80 training places in hospitals\nthroughout the UK. Trainees\nreceive a salary and MSc\nfees are paid on their behalf.\nAfter the initial two years,\non successful completetion of\nexams, trainees progress to\ngrade B jobs and hopefully\nobtain state registration after\nanother two years.\nMedical physics is concerned with the application\nand development of the principles and techniques of physics to the diagnosis, treatment\nand prevention of human\ndisease. Medical physicists\nhave very diverse roles that\ncan include comissioning new\nmedical equipment, routine\nquality assurance of equipment or the development of\nnew treatment and diagnosis\ntechniques. There is a huge\nshortage of medical physicists meaning that a trained\nmedical physicist will never\nbe out of work! You can find\nout more at www.ipem.ac.uk\nor at www.nhsclinicalscientists.info.\u201d\nDo you have any advice\nfor students who want\na career in research or\nadvice resulting from\nyour experiences?\n\u201cMake sure you get some\nhands on experience in a hospital before you apply. Just\nring up a medical physics\ndepartment and ask them\nfor a couple of days experi-ence.\nTake copies of your final\nyear project report along to\nthe interview (even if they\ndon\u2019t request a copy), and\nmake sure you give all the\ninterviewers a copy; it will\nimpress them.

Despite this,\nwe kept an upbeat attitude,\nknowing that we were capable of better play, especially\nwith the legend that is Baby\nPaul upgrading his shirt to\nnumber 10.\nFrom our kick-off, Brunel\nran back hard and fast to test\nour all-new defensive regime,\nwhich had been perfected\nin ten minutes earlier on in\nthe day. Given that this was\nsufficient last time to gift\nthem innumerable tries, they\nwere slightly put out to find\nthemselves stopped by the\nchunky back line combo of Ed\nPoulding and Alex Ferguson.\nSome scrappy play on our 22\nresulted in 15 consecutive\nscrums, due to some moody\nBrunel front row players\nbinding incorrectly.\nFollowing this concerted\npressure, Brunel sneaked\nin a try after a well-worked\nbacks move. After the restart,\ndetermined defence and\nsome classy lineouts kept\nBrunel pinned back in their\nhalf of the pitch for quite\nsome time before they drove\nover from a lineout to score\nagain. The rest of the half\nprogressed in the same vein,\nuntil star winger Rob Phillips\nsnatched the ball mid-pass\non the Brunel 22 and skipped\nover the line for his cheekiest\ntry yet.\nThe second half opened\nwith some slightly less glamorous play, gifting Brunel\nsome more easy points. The\nprospect of conceding more\npoints seemed to wake up\nthe stirring beast that is the\nSecond XV, however, and\nwe replied with some of our\nbest play of the season, well\nsupported by a vocal crowd\nof First XV players and\nVirgins.\nThe entrance of Mark\nbrought some much needed\nstability to the scrums, and\neven Gareth\u2019s 30 second\ncameo seemed to cause\nBrunel concern.\nWe scored two more tries,\nboth coming from lineouts.\nIn the first instance, your\nhumble narrator plucked the\nball from the lineout while\nBrunel looked the other\nway, yielding enough space\nthat even I could jog over\nthe line. Our next try came\nfrom Charlie Davidson, who\ndespite being cuddled by\nthree Brunel players was\njudged to have grounded the\nball cleanly.\nThe last minutes of the\nmatch saw more pressure\nwhich could have resulted in\nanother score, before some\nfat mess of a prop grew tired\nof Rich Bish and his rapid\npenalties. Deciding that\nrather than stop conceding\npenalties they would simply\nsit on his neck, a brief hiatus ensued while Imperial\nRugby\u2019s campest EMT fondly\ncaressed Rich to \u2018check for\nspinal injury\u2019.\nRather than risk permanent injury, \u2018Lucky\u2019 Dave\nGriffiths joined the fray at\nscrum half to start his third\ngame for the club in two\nyears, following shoulder\ndamage at his fresher debut\nand an injury for an external\nclub just before the start of\nthis season. Sadly, his luck\nhas yet to change, and he\nsuffered a nasty dislocation\nin the final minute of the\nmatch after some excellent\nplay. Bad luck Dave, and\nthanks to the Virgins for\ntransporting him to Charing\nCross Hospital.\nRUGBY\nSeconds give Brunel a close game\nWEDNESDAY\n26 JANUARY\nBADMINTON\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 2nd 6\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nGKT Women\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 4\nBASKETBALL\nLondon Met Men\u2019s 2nd 72\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 53\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 20\nLondon Met Women\u2019s 1st 54\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1st 0\nSussex Men\u2019s 1st 4\nCanterbury Christ Church\nMen\u2019s 2nd 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nLSE Men\u2019s 4th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 1\nLSE Men\u2019s 5th 0\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 7th 5\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 1\nRVC Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 2\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 5th 0\nSchool of Pharmacy Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 0\nHOCKEY\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1st 4\nRoehampton Men\u2019s 1st 0\nLSE Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 3rd 5\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nBrunel Men\u2019s 2nd 7\nHertfordshire Women\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nUCL Women\u2019s 3rd 0\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 5\nImperial Medics Women\u2019s 1st 3\nKingston Women\u2019s 1st 2\nNETBALL\nHolloway Women\u2019s 1st 37\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 16\nPortsmouth Women\u2019s 4th 34\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 29\nRUGBY\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 29\nBucks Chilterns Men\u2019s 1st 7\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 20\nBrunel Men\u2019s 2nd 31\nImperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1st 26\nCollege of St Mark & St John\nMen\u2019s 1st 35\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 83\nSurrey Women\u2019s 1st 0\nSQUASH\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nKing\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 2\nTENNIS\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 3\nLondon Met Men\u2019s 2nd 7\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 5\nRoehampton Men\u2019s 1st 5\nFRIDAY\n28 JANUARY\nBASKETBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 62\nHolloway Men\u2019s 1st 73\nSATURDAY\n29 JANUARY\nFOOTBALL\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nSt Barts & Royal London\nMen\u2019s 1st 2\nLSE Men\u2019s 3rd 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 0\nRSM Men\u2019s 1st 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 5\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 1\nRUGBY\nHolloway Men\u2019s 2nd 6\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 25\nMONDAY\n31 JANUARY\nSQUASH\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 5\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nResults\nSEND US YOUR SPORTS REPORTS!\nIf you\u2019ve played a match, been on tour or entered a competition, why not write about it for Felix?

    "content": "A report by Scientists for Global Responsibility was launched at a meeting in\nParliament last week. Kate Wighton was there and reports for Felix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005\n4\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nScience may hold the solutions to the world\u2019s problems,\nor it may perpetuate them. A\nreport published two weeks\nago has found that even if science could help in relieving\nglobal poverty or slowing climate change, it is much more\nlikely that scientific expertise\nwill focus on developing the\nnext high-technology weap-ons.\nThe Soldiers in the\nLaboratory report published\nby Scientists for Global\nResponsibility (SGR) was\nlaunched in a meeting at the\nHouses of Parliament, which\nFelix attended.\nThe report states that the\nmilitary has too large an\ninfluence on UK research and\ndevelopment, with a third of\nall public research funding\ncoming from the Ministry of\nDefence (MoD) and 40% of\ngovernment R&D personnel\nemployed by the MoD.\nAccording to the report,\nthis has created a defence-centred global climate, mar-ginalising the social causes\nand consequences of conflict\nand contributing to a global\narms proliferation and refugee crisis.\nAs a solution, the report\ncalls for money to be redirected into peace-building and\nsustainable developments.\nDr Chris Langley, the\nreport\u2019s author, argued: \u201cThe\nmain points of this report can\nbe grouped into three main\nheadings: the disproportionate and powerful influence\nof the military sector on the\nresearch agenda of areas of\nscience, technology and engi-neering; the lack of funds\nfor other endeavours, which\naddress peace issues, security issues and those related\nto social responsibility; and\nthe third is the closing up of\naccessibility for whole areas\nof science, particularly the\nemerging technologies, when\nthe military is involved.\u201d\nSpeakers at the meeting\nargued that the military are\nseeking high-technology solutions to complex problems,\nwhen in fact technology alone\ndoes not hold the answers to\nworld conflict.\nThe current strategy of military spending was claimed to\nbe outdated and harks back\nto the Cold War. As Dr Ian\nGibson, MP and Chair of the\nHouse of Commons select\ncommittee for science and\ntechnology, explained at the\nmeeting:\n\u201cThere is a long history\nof battles of nation against\nnation and better weapons\nmean that you win the battle.\nSo when that is the underlying political force in a nation,\nand it\u2019s gone on for centuries,\nthen we\u2019re just continuing so\nthat all the creativity that we\nhave goes into making better\nweapons.\u201d\nDr Langley proposes that\nhigh-technology, weapon-focused solutions will not\nsolve the international terrorism issue. Diplomacy, policing\nand border control may prove\nto be more effective.\nDr Langley also said that\nthe common argument that\nmilitary spending produces\nspin-offs into the public sector is fundamentally flawed.\nThe process of adapting a\ntechnology from a military to\na civilian context is long and\nexpensive and does not yield\nthe benefits that some claim,\nhe said.\nAnother key point of the\nreport was the involvement\nof universities in military\nresearch. Through military-academia collaborations (of\nwhich Imperial has nine \u2013 one\nof the highest in the country),\nthe report argues that the\nnext wave of researchers are\nbeing sucked into an environment of how to win conflict\nrather than how to prevent it.\nBut the funding incentives\nthese collaborations may\noffer may take precedence\nover the moral and ethical\nissues.\nDr Langley said: \u201cMany\nuniversities are strapped for\ncash, so they are very susceptible to the campaigns waged\nby the military corporation.\nFor a lot of people the excitement of science may take\nover from a concern about\nwhere the money is coming\nfrom.\u201d\nDr Gibson believe students\nshould be proactive and question the ethical issues surrounding military-sponsored\nresearch. \u201c[Students] ought\nto talk about this. They ought\nto insist they have courses\non it.\u201d\nDr Gibson argued that universities have portrayed science as being neutral when,\nin fact, it is deeply political.\nEllin Barklund is one\nImperial student who agrees\nthat students should be\nproactive about ethical and\nmoral issues. Ms Barklund, a\nthird year electrical and electronic engineering student,\nis a member of Scientists\nfor Global Responsibility\nand intends to set-up the\nfirst student SGR group at\nImperial: \u201cImperial could be\na flagship for this issue by\nstarting the first SGR student group. As a science and\ntechnology university, there\nis definitely a place for this.\nI do not want to start telling\npeople that they should think\nabout the ethical implications\nof research; I simply think\nthat there should be information provided about the issues\nand dilemmas that students\nmay face when deciding upon\ntheir careers.\u201d\nShe would like to create a\nversion of the SGR booklet,\nAn Ethical Career in Science\nand Technology?, that would\nbe tailored more to Imperial\nstudents with sections on\nparticular areas of research\nsuch as biology, physics and\nchemistry.\nCareer fairs that deal with\nethical careers in science\nhave been held at Imperial\nin the past; however, it was\ndecided that there was not\nenough interest \u2013 possibly\ndue to the large number of\nvolunteer organisations featured \u2013 to organise another.\nThe University of London\nUnion had planned to hold a\nfair this year, although that\ntoo looks uncertain.\nBoth Cambridge and Oxford\noffer alternative careers\nfairs and Tim Foxon, secretary of SGR, believes that\nthrough active involvement\nwith groups like the Imperial\nCareers office, another\nImperial ethical careers fair\nmay be possible.\nTheissueofopennessisalso\nbeing discussed. Barklund\nthinks that students should\nlook at the kind of research\nthat is going on at Imperial.\nAs this is military work there\nwill obviously be sensitivity\nissues; however, Dr Langley\nargues that a lack of openness stunts discussion about\nmilitary-funded research, and\nthat this should be more open\nto public scrutiny, especially since research may have\nimplications for society.\nAlthough the report\u2019s findings and proposals are ethically sound, they are nothing new to people working\nin research and development.\nThe problem is not raising\nthe issues; it is how to deal\nwith them. This prompts the\nquestion: Will this report have\nany impact?\nMilitary-funded science is\na complex issue with many\nfactors involved, a major one\nbeing the link between weapons development and revenue generated from UK arms\nsales.\nAlthough Dr Langley does\nnot believe this report will\nchange things overnight\n(even though the report has\nhad quite a healthy take-up\nwith 2000 copies being downloaded so far), he hopes it\nmay make people at least\nconsider the issue:\n\u201c[This report] is asking people to consider the amount\nof money that\u2019s going into\nmilitary research and development and asking us to\nconsider if this is the most\ncost effective way that we can\nmake the world a more just\nand peaceful one. Clearly, to\ndefend a country we\u2019ll need\nmilitary investment of some\nsort. It\u2019s just the amount and\npervasiveness and the lack\nof any voice questioning that\ninvestment that concerns\nus.\u201d\n\u201c...hi-technology\nweapon-focused\nsolutions will not solve\nthe international\nterrorism issue\u201d\nDR CHRIS LANGLEY\nTowards an ethical research policy\nParliament: the venue for scientists gathering to take on political issues\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nNews\nin brief\nHuman stem cells\nbecome nerve\ncells in study\nStem cells taken from human\nembryos were coaxed into\nbecoming motor neurons in\nan experiment that might\nhelp scientists repair damaged nervous systems. The\nstudy supports claims by stem\ncell researchers that they can\ntrain embryonic stem cells to\ndevelop into any type of tissue\nin the body. They hope this\ntechnology will allow cures\nfor a range of nervous system injuries.\n\u2018New Manhattan\nproject\u2019 to fight\nbioterror\nThe world needs an effort\nsimilar to that behind the\ncreation of the atomic bomb\nto tackle the threat of bio-warfare, US Senate Majority\nLeader Bill Frist said. \u201cWe\nneed to do something that\neven dwarfs the Manhattan\nproject,\u201d Frist told the World\nEconomic Forum in Davos.\nHe predicted that the world\nwould experience another\nbioweapon attack within the\nnext decade.\nScientists grapple\nwith climate as\ncrisis grows\nScientists will step into a feud\nbetween Washington and its\nallies over global warming at\na British-sponsored meeting\nthis week.

Alongside the\nBambi-man in the middle was\nDave the Hippy, with tricky\nwingers Parrot and Demetris\nstarting in their usual roles.\nFresh from his brush with\na certain tsunami, Shwin\nstarted up front with Jai.\nThe slick passing, which\nhad so deserted the fourths\nduring the matches against\nthe fifths, made an instant\nand welcome return, and\nImperial managed to create\na multitude of chances in the\nfirst few minutes with Jai\nand Shwin both having half-chances.\nThe breakthrough came\nonly thanks to a momentous\nhowler from the UCL keeper.\nA nice move involving most of\nthe team managed to work the\nball to the Parrot on the left,\nwho jinked and twisted past\na couple of players in trademark style before unleashing\nwhat can only be described as\na daisy cutting trundler.\nThe keeper thought the best\nway to deal with such an effort\nwas to leap in the air and\npounce on it like some sort\nof strange cat. Hilariously, he\nmissed, and the ball trickled\nthrough his arms and legs to\ngift Imperial a soft lead.\nChances upon chances\nwere subsequently created\nby the impressive midfield,\nand both Jai and Shwin really\nshould have done better when\nneat passing moves presented them both with gilt-edged chances. Sadly, Shwin\nspooned a free header into\norbit, and Jai somehow managed to screw the ball wide\nwhen my Grandma could\nhave scored. Thankfully, both\nlads kept their heads up, and\nwhen Shwin was presented\nwith another simple chance\n\u2013 thanks to some woeful UCL\nmarking at a free-kick \u2013 he\ngratefully knocked it in to give\nImperial a deserved two goal\nlead at half-time.\nThe second half was much\nof the same with shots from\nImperial raining down onto\nthe UCL keeper. It was no\nsurprise that IC went three\nup when Jai flew through the\nair like a swooping eagle (not\nof the Figo variety) to power\nhome a Parrot cross from the\nleft.\nSadly, fatigue set in at\naround the seventy minute\nmark, and UCL, to their\ncredit, began to dominate\nthe game. With Bambi struggling with a bash on the nose,\ntheir very fast, very small,\nvery annoying winger managed to escape from three\npoor tackles in the centre cir-cle, freeing up some room for\nthe strikers. The pair of them\ncombined nicely and a neat\nfinish gave UCL a way back\ninto the match.\nUCL continued to dominate through IC\u2019s tiredness,\nbut against the run of play\nImperial restored the three\ngoal advantage when the\nParrot bent a free-kick in off\nthe upright, despite the best\nefforts of Jai on the line trying to hi-jack the goal. The\nscoring was still not finished\nthough, and another lapse\nin concentration at the back\nallowed UCL to claw back\nanother.\nFour-two was how the\nmatch ended, with the fourths\nearning a morale-boosting\nvictory. Among the positives\nfor the side were Bambi\u2019s\nexcellent battling display in\nmidfield and a far greater\nassuredness on the ball; how-ever, there are still plenty of\nimprovements that must be\nmade if we are to win the Cup\nthis year.\nFOOTBALL\nFourths make winning start to 2005\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nSt George\u2019s Men\u2019s 4th 2\nDespite TKT's best efforts,\nwe eventually made it back\nto the Croydon Badlands.\nStepping over the headless\nbody in the sports centre car\npark, it was hard to ignore\nthe smell of death in the air,\nwhich was only overpowered\nby the stench of the goalkeep-er's kit.\nOur efforts to confuse the\nopposition by turning up 30\nminutes late seemed to succeed as we took the game\nby the scruff of the neck and\nrammed it thoroughly into\ntheir half.\nSt Georges had started\nslowly, and Second Avenue\ncapitalised, latching onto the\nrebound of Tightlips' powerful shot and turning it past\ntheir wretched 'keeper.\nThe DeIViants dominated\nplay for the entire first half.\nOpposition attacks were broken down almost as soon\nas they were started. With\nTightlips controlling the\ngame from midfield, Bleeding\nDick and Glasto prevented\nany chance of the oppostion\nentering our half, and, with\nthe creativity and hard work\nof Spanish Shinquisition,\nCreamy Mouthful and\nColgate, it looked as though\nSt Georges were almost dead\nand buried, especially when\nTKT slammed in a shot from\nthe top of the D to make it 2-0.\nThe first half came to a close\nwith practically everyone in\nthe St Georges half.\nAt half time the opposition\nused a diversionary tactic\nby setting the trees behind\ntheir goal on fire. It was\nrumoured that they had\nstrapped their sub to a tree\nand sacrificed him in order\nto turn the game around.\nUnfortunately, their sacrifice\nseemed to do the trick. As\nDirty Sheets eyed up the firemen at the beginning of the\nsecond half, his \u2018clean sheet\u2019\nwas soiled when St Georges\npulled one back. Although\nstunned by conceding this\nearly second half goal, the\nDeIViants soon steadied the\nship thanks to the hard work\nand perseverance of Slow\nOn The Uptake and some\nRandoms.\nThe search for the third\ngoal, which would kill the\ngame (and be the fifth killing in Croydon that day), had\nstarted. TKT created several\nchances but failed to take\nany of them whilst Post and\nTightlips also had oppor-tunties.\nAs the game entered into\nits final stages, there was\nan awful feeling in the air\nand it wasn't because news\nhad filtered through that\nan undertaker had been\nrunover by his own hearse\nat a nearby location. Many\nchances had been wasted and\nit would take just one lucky\ncounter-attack from the opposition to be able to score and\nlevel the game. What followed was completely and\nutterly devastating for the\nDeIViants.\nIt was at the death (con-tinuing the theme of the day)\nthat the oppostion had a\nlucky counter-attack and\nwere able to score and level\nthe game.\nOn the way home, the\ndepressed DeIViants suddenly realised that things\nweren't so bad. It was the\nfirst point of the season, and\nthe first time we had scored,\nand we hadn't conceded any\nshort corners. It was a fine\nperformance from the whole\nteam.\nFear not, for the DeIViants\nare on their way back!\nHOCKEY\nFirst points of season for DeIViants\nSponsored by\nImperial 1st 23\nGoldsmiths 1st 22\nBy Erika Kennington\nA double header on Monday\nsaw the firsts add another two\nwins to the season, in their\ntightest game to date.\nFollowing numerous postponements by Goldsmiths, it\nwas decided that this match\nwould count for both the\nBUSA league and ULU cup\nmatches, setting up a game\nwith 6 points at stake.\nHaving never played\nGoldsmiths before, we had no\nidea what we would be up\nagainst, and this was our first\nmatch since the Christmas\nbreak so everyone was feeling\na bit rusty. Spirits were high,\nthough, as it gave us chance to\nunveil the new kit, although it\ndid lead us to question its suitability on cold Monday nights\nin the middle of winter!\nSo to the match. Imperial\nset off quietly in the first quar-ter, with both teams evenly\nmatched, gauging the tactics\nof the opposition. Freezing\nconditions meant that the\npitch was icing over as we\nplayed, severely slowing down\nour game, and we took only\na two-goal lead into the first\nbreak.\nWe picked up the pace in\nthe second and third quarters,\nalbeit in an attempt to avoid\nhypothermia, but despite\nsome great play working the\nball up the court, we couldn\u2019t\nestablish a decisive lead.\nGoldsmiths were clearly not\ngoing to give up the points\nwithout a fight, and our eight\nweek break since our last\nmatch meant we were not\nquite on top form. A few dodgy\nset-plays cost us some of our\nlead in the final quarter, but\nwe held our nerve and one-goal lead to the final whistle.\nAt the end of the day, though,\na win is still a win (or two in\nthis case), and has taken us\nto the quarter finals of the\nULU Cup and third place in\nour BUSA league. Well done\nguys!\nNETBALL\nTwice in one night\nWye Women\u2019s 1st 20\nGKT Women\u2019s 1st 15\nBy Lucy Le Cocq\nRoad rage caused pre-match\ndrama when the Wye girls\nventured out of the countryside to remind GKT that they\ncan\u2019t beat us. Ever. Domestic\nviolence between our army of\nmale westcountry supporters\non the A205 was too much\nfor our violent number eight\nwho felt the need to abuse\nthem, risking her life in the\nsmog and London traffic in\nthe process.\nOnce we had composed\nourselves enough to look for\nthe pitch, we were utterly\nshocked to find it located in\na rather urban area; however\nthe relief of seeing grass for\nthe first time in an hour was\nimmense.\nThe forwards worked hard\nand we were rewarded with\nour first try from a lineout set\npiece. Gobby missed the conversion as the ball appeared\nto be too heavy to leave the\nground. The embarrassment\nwas too much and a small\nscratch on her knee caused\npotential hospitalisation.\nHowever, some good running and talking earlier in the\ngame more than made up for\nthis. After a quick reorganisa-tion, Annie was drafted in to\nplay fly half, where she did a\ngreat job.\nRadio Full Back thought\nthat we would crumble, however we didn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t on\nthe right wavelength. Great\nrunning from the elusive Em\nput us on the scoreboard,\nhowever GKT equalised. The\nWye midgets couldn\u2019t hold\nthe weight of the GKT maul,\nanchored by their apparently\nunfriendly giant number\neight. This result resulted in\nthe crumbling of the maul.\nThe match showed great\nform from our captain Scum,\nwho combined awesome tackling with quick offloading from\nthe scrum. Her leadership\nkept our heads up throughout\nthe game.\nIn the second half Hetty\u2019s\nawesome power gave us\nanother five points and\nEmily\u2019s massive speed\nblasted through the opposi-tion. Suzie\u2019s personal experience with number 7 put her\noff hurting anyone to that\nextent ever again.\nGreat hooking by Cat was\nonly one feature of our great\nscrum which turned the ball\nover on several occasions.\nBecky showed great potential\nwith her running and tackling.\nRecognising the good bits and\nworking hard together will be\nnecessary in preparation for\nthe next game.\nThis was not our tidiest\ngame, but commitment from\nthe whole team contributed\nto our victory. The hospitality\nfrom GKT was the best this\nseason and we\u2019d like to thank\nthem for a well-matched\ngame. The final scoreline was\na true reflection of a match\nthat could have gone either\nway and was undecided until\nthe final whistle.\nRUGBY\nRole play road rage puts Wye in the zone\n\n"

A \u2018Girls\nNight In\u2019 of course!\nJust to keep your faith in\nImperial College, some people really do have fun here\n\u2013 the girls! The event was\norganised by the Pinks Social\nClub (Pinks for short), which\nraised money for Breast\nCancer Care. The night was\na huge success, raising over\n\u00a31000. Aleks Corr, the hostess with the most-est of the\nnight, was ecstatic with the\nresult and claims that a bigger and better \u2018Girls Night In\u2019\nis planned for next year!\nThe night started off with\nan insightful talk by Marcia,\na volunteer from the Breast\nCancer Care Charity, about\nher past experience of the\ndisease and how the charity helps to support everyone\naffected by breast cancer. It\nwas a very thought provoking\ntalk, and I\u2019m sure everyone\nlearnt something.\nThe fun and games came\nalong when Ann Summers\nhit the stage. The first game\nproved what many of us\nalready knew, that a certain Pink lady was donned\n\u2018Slapper of the Night\u2019 in an \u2018I\nhave never\u2019 style game (but a\nlot more fun and without the\ndirty pintage). Sexy models\nAlex, Sam and Kitty strutted their funky stuff on the\nstage with gorgeous lingerie\n\u2013 a brave thing to do, with so\nmany girls in the room.\nNext came what guys\nknow as their enemies \u2013 sex\ntoys (and plenty were sold)\n\u2013 before another entertaining game that accompanied\nthis with lots of volunteers.\nI\u2019d like to say thank you to\nHenrietta (Ann Summers\nlady) for putting on a fantastic show, which everyone\nthoroughly enjoyed.\nAs the hostess proceeded\nto obtain more Dutch cour-age, the male auction took\noff. The Pinks would like to\nthank these brave, brave\nmen who were willing to sell\nthemselves in skimpy thongs\nto the rabble: Steve Barham,\nMike Hicks, Tom Nieto and\nBen Anstiss made a total of\n\u00a3280. Well done boys, we hope\nyou enjoy your time with your\nbuyers!\nNext was the raffle, with\nsuperb prizes. The Pinks\nwould like to thank all our\nsponsors for their generous donations: Odeon,\nWagamama, Lush, NYNC,\nCasa Art, and of course, Ann\nSummers. Well done to those\nwho won the prizes \u2013 I\u2019m so\njealous!\nThe last of the entertainment came in the form of\nBlind Date \u2013 Cilla style! Yet\nagain, thank you to the members of the opposite sex who\nvolunteered their time with\nsuch courage: Andy Easter,\nTim Praill, Gary Flanagan\nand Serge Lioutyi. Also,\na big thank you to Vicky\nArbabzadah who was brave\nenough to ask the question\n\u201cIf you were a sex toy, what\nwould you be and why?\u201d Well\ndone girl!\nThe two lucky couples\n(Libby and Andy, Vicky and\nTim) will be enjoying meals\nwith wine in the Giraffe and\nSopranos restaurants down\non High Street Kensington.\nWe hope that the blind dates\ngo well \u2013 keep us posted!\nThe party moved on to The\nProspect on Fulham Road.\nIf you know anything about\nthat bit of the night, please\ncontact us, as we do not have\na clue!\nThere was one low point to\nthe evening. One out of two\nwhite pin boxes went missing\nat about 9\u201310.30pm. If anyone\nknows of its whereabouts, the\nPinks would be ever so grateful for its return, as it had\nquite a bit of money in, which\nwe would like to donate to\nBreast Cancer Care.\nAll in all, an absolutely\nfabulous time was had by\neveryone \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen a\nroom full of so many giggly\ngirls since secondary school!\nRemember girls, if you purchased anything from Ann\nSummers, you can collect it\nfrom us now \u2013 just email us at\npinks_imperial@yahoo.co.uk.\nIf any girls would like to join\nthe Pinks Social Club, please\nfeel free to come along to any\nof our events \u2013 we\u2019re usually\nfound in the Union in South\nKensington on a Thursday\nnight. You don\u2019t have to be a\ndrinker at all, just a girl who\nknows how to have fun! We\nalso love organising charity\nevents, so if you want to help\nout or have some ideas, give\nus a bell!\nLastly, thank you to all\nthose who came to the \u2018Girls\nNight In\u2019. This event wouldn\u2019t\nhave been anything without\nyour support or enthusiasm\n(yes guys, there are girls at\nImperial!)\nGo Girl Power!\nPINKS\nGirls just wanna have fun!\nBy Elizabeth Sawyer\nLoading rucksacks into the\nback of a minibus, making the\nobligatory stops in Egham\nand Warwick, and some crazy\nroundabout experiences en-route \u2013 it had to be another\nFellwanderers trip, destina-tion: Snowdonia!\nWe arrived (eventually) at\nSt Mary\u2019s hut and tried to\nsleep, but downstairs there\nwas some serious wood chopping going on. Still, revenge\ncame on Saturday morning,\nwhen we got up at six to start\nwalking. The mad midnight\naxemen didn\u2019t find things so\nfunny then...\nOn Saturday, we walked\nup Snowdon, starting on the\nminers\u2019 track, then swapping\nto a nameless (not a good\nsign) path, before eventually meeting Watkin near\nthe top. Tom proved his\nnavigational excellence by\nguiding us through the inside\nof a cloud all the way up and\ndown the mountain \u2013 no\neasy taskwhen you can\u2019t see\nmore than five metres in any\ndirection.\nCold and damp, we finished the day in Pete\u2019s Eats\nin Llanberris, before heading back to the hut for some\nOutdoor Club strength chilli,\nsome cooling banoffee pie,\nand some near-traumas\ninvolving buses, farmers and\nsheep (OK, I lied about the\nsheep).\nSunday was another wet\nday. We split the group, and\nhalf did Snowdon again (via\na different route) whilst the\nother half decided it might\nbe more interesting to see\nsome lower level stuff: disused slate mines, an old for-tress, each other (something\nthat had not been possible\nthe previous day due to the\nenveloping cloud).\nJutta put up an especially\nbrave fight against the condi-tions, which had even the driest of us uncomfortable and\nnecessitated that Chris purchase some trousers. Anyone\nat the Union on Thursday 20th\nwill recognise how desperately cold and wet we must have\nbeen \u2013 what else could have\ndriven Chris to this moment\nof insanity?\nAnyway, back to Imperial via\nthe pub and Staines (a pleasant change from Egham) and\nthat was our trip over. I think\nit\u2019s fair to say that, despite\nthe weather, a good time was\nhad by all.\nFELLWANDERERS\nClimbing through the clouds\n\u201cWhat did you say about Imperial women?\u201d Three of the Pinks Social Club at their \u2018Girls Night In\u2019\n\u201cWho\u2019ll start me at 20 pence?\u201d This male student looks as\nthough he\u2019s thoroughly enjoying being auctioned off...\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005 21\nALBUM REVIEWS\nGroups that can be associated with\nthe garage rock revolution a couple\nof years back either changed their\nsound to move away from the spent\nmedium, such as The Von Bondies,\nor changed their name hoping noone would notice, like The Beat-Up\n(formerly known as The Beatings).\nTrust their luck that a U2-loving\nband from Las Vegas (The Kills, you\nignorant scum) had to come along,\nso now this duo are stuck with plan\nA if they\u2019re to stay vital.\nThe Kills were an exciting prospect when stripped-down rock\nwas welcome thanks to The White\nStripes and The Black Keys. But\nThe Stripes beefed up their sound\n(Jack overdubbed to a Queen-like\nexcess and Meg hit the skins a bit\nharder) and the Black Keys faded\ninto anonymity (or glowing Pitchfork\nreviews, same difference \u2013 Ed). So\ncome 2003, when I last saw them\nlive (at Leeds festival), they were\njust so tedious to watch, I put it on a\npar with an Embrace concert, and I\nthink said whingers have more sex\nand drama in their show (they do\nhave long hair, DAN-GER-OUS!).\nIf The Kills don\u2019t want to fade into\nobscurity, then they need to roll up\ntheir thrift store sleeves and make\ntheir music essential.\nWell, optimistically speaking, they\nwon\u2019t disappoint fans, if they still\nhave any fans. It resembles their\ndebut album in a non-ashamed way,\nand they took as long to make this\nalbum as its predecessor. The drum\nmachines are there still, but they\u2019ve\nwaned in excitement. Maybe the\npressure of the follow-up got to their\nbeat-making circuit boards; why is\nit that the technology has to suf-fer? I\u2019m going to start up a fund for\nmisused machinery in music. It\u2019ll be\ncalled Emineminem (I welcome any\nlawsuits). I already have support\nfrom the Strokes\u2019 effects pedals (suf-fering from neglect).\nIt is so difficult to talk about this\nalbum. The more I listen to it, the\nmore laboured it feels. Of all eleven\ntracks I only seem to enjoy No Wow,\nLove Is A Deserter and Murdermile;\nthe other tracks I ignore. The title\ntrack has a nice Kraftwerk-esque\nfeel in the monotony of the kick\ndrums. It shows that they have darkened their sound and sets the tone\nfor the album with lyrics like, \u201cyou\ngonna have to step over my dead\nbody before you walk out that door.\u201d\nIt builds steadily and manages to\nexcite me (commendable). Love Is\nA Deserter feels like a progression\nin sound incorporating some catchy\nnew wave guitar licks via the delta\nblues. The last of the three decent\ntracks is propelled by a wonderful\ntrain-like stomp with the melodic\nline: \u201cIt\u2019s a train wreck, you got me\non the wrong track honey\u201d sung by\nHotel (guitarist and vocalist).\nAside from those songs we have\na boring, aimless and ideas-starved\nalbum. It\u2019s the musical equivalent of\nfilling out a tax form: You don\u2019t want\nto do it, you can\u2019t see how it benefits\nyou and you feel like you should\u2019ve\nkept the money.\nMatty Hoban\nKevin Mark Trail first came to the\nattention of the music world when\nhe worked with The Streets, laying down the vocals for tracks such\nas Let\u2019s Push Things Forward and\nSame Old Thing. Now he\u2019s decided\nto step out of the shadow of his good\nfriend Mike Skinner and make a\nname for himself with this, his debut\nalbum.\nThis collection of songs, all written and co-produced by Trail,\ntries to bring the listener into the\nWembley raised singer\u2019s world: life\nin London, relationships and family.\nStylistically, he manages to incorporate aspects of soul, reggae and\ndrum and bass.\nAlbum opener and next single, D\nThames, sets the tone with drum\nand piano loops, providing the backdrop to Trail\u2019s smooth, soulful voice.\nThe next track, Perspective, was\nreleased as a single and describes\nTrail\u2019s earlier years, growing up in\na single parent family, scribbling\nlyrics in school lessons and singing\nBoys II Men songs in the backroom\nwhile working. Trail\u2019s reggae influences are most prominent on this\nsong, with its laid-back beat accompanied by requisite trumpet blasts.\nOther highlights include the wonderfully uplifting Full Moon, with\nits strings and gospel choir-style\nbacking vocals, and the beautiful\nBreathless. However, there are one\nor two songs where Trail fails quite\nbadly. Bread is slightly too bouncy\nand preachy for its own good, sounding like a government advertisement for happy family living, and Da\nRagga is just a mess of brass instruments and amateur rapping.\nThe NME described Kevin\nas \u201cThe UK\u2019s Next Big Thing in\nragga-infused Brit soul,\u201d and other\ncritics have been similarly full of\npraise. Based on this debut he\u2019s not\nquite the finished article, but he\u2019s\ncertainly got more about him than\nLemar or most other current British\nsoul artists you care to mention.\nHe has already supported some\nbig names like Massive Attack,\nN*E*R*D and Beverly Knight.\nHopefully he can use those experiences to develop and build from this\nsolid debut.\nDom Wong\nDubbed as a new R&B sensation,\nCiara has already been seen atop\nboth US and UK charts. Exploiting\na new sub-genre, Goodies blends\nestablished R&B with crunk, leading to varied results. Not only has\nCiara rallied a host of guest vocal-ists, including the likes of Ludacris,\nR. Kelly and Missy Elliott, but she\nhas also recruited some big names\nbehind the mixing desk, namely Lil\nJon and Jazze Pha.\nThe title track, Goodies, was the\nfirst released single off the album.\nIt\u2019s a collaboration with the deep\nvoiced Petey Pablo, featuring\nstripped-down backing, thick synth\nbass and pseudo sirens over Ciara\u2019s\nraunchy whispers. Whipping up\nmedia hype as it rose to the top of\nthe charts, it is soon to be followed\nby 1, 2 Step, another collaboration\n(this time with Missy Elliot). 1, 2\nStep is similar to Goodies; it\u2019s a mixture of gritty bass, electro splurts\nand smooth melodies - a sure fire hit\nin and out of the club.\nUnfortunately, past these two\ntracks the album falls short of expectations with Destiny\u2019s Child-esque\nslow ballads failing to impress,\nalong with the adoption of Sean\nPaul\u2019s technique of announcing his\nname at the beginning of songs.\nCiara tries hard, exploring a variety of vocal styles and demonstrating her undeniable talent. Goodies\nalmost collapses in its attempt to\nbe original; the repetitive electro\nsound effects become annoying by\nthe third track and accumulate in a\nSuper Mario-style ditty supporting\nR. Kelly\u2019s appearance producing on\nNext To You.\nBeyond the obsession with phone\ncalls (reminiscent of Blazing Squad\u2019s\nLove On The Line), Ciara delivers\nupbeat, chill-out R&B with a new\ntwist. Packed with big names from\nthe industry, Goodies has a fresh\nsound, with catchy lyrics and some\nhot tracks (notably Oh, featuring\nLudacris, and Lookin\u2019 At You). A\nfemale Usher she isn\u2019t, but this is\nonly the first album.\nNick Simpson\nTo the beat, y\u2019all\nThe Kills tackle the difficult second album, Kevin Mark Trail (he of The Streets fame) releases\nhis ragga-influenced debut, and Ciara blends crunk and R\u2018n\u2019B with interesting results\nThe Kills\nNo Wow\n(Domino)\nHHHII\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nKevin Mark Trail\nJust Living\n(EMI)\nHHHII\nThe Kills: driving, churning riffs and sleazy vocals make for an above average band\nFile under:\nDark nu-rock NME darlings\nIf you like this, try:\nBloc Party \u2013 Silent Alarm\nFile under:\nRagga-infused Brit soul\nIf you like this, try:\nLemar, et al\nCiara: she doesn\u2019t look crunk, does she?\nCiara\nGoodies\n(Jive)\nHHHHI\nFile under:\nUpbeat, club-ready R\u2019n\u2019B\nIf you like this, try:\nKelis \u2013 Tasty\n\n"

The topic for this\nweek is a little controversial\nI am afraid, so here comes a\ndisclaimer:\nBy reading this article, you\nhereby consent to the following terms:\n1. You won\u2019t be a muppet and hurt yourself while\nattempting anything you\nlearn in these pages, and if\nyou do, no-one but you is to\nblame.\n2) If you are a world-renowned martial artist,\nskilled in many deadly\narts and a master of the\nNunchuka, you won\u2019t try to\ncorrect any of this, or try to\nthreaten me, because I scare\neasily.\nRight, now that\u2019s over, I\nwould like to introduce our\ntopic for the week:\nNunchucka! You don\u2019t have\nto do kung fu to play with\nthese seriously cool sticks-on-string. The poetic movements associated with battering an opponent into bloody\nsubmission lend themselves\nequally well to showing off\nin front of friends, relatives\nand (crucially) members of\nthe opposite sex. Borrowing\nmovements more traditionally seen in the Maori art of Poi\nswinging or the ever-popular\nfire staff, the lightning-fast\nswings, stops and strikes are\nboth delicate and awe inspir-ing.\nFirst, start off with both\n\u2018sticks\u2019 in one hand, with the\nchain (or string) hanging\ndown [see picture 1, right].\nAllow the front grip to\nfall. As it does, it will swing\ndown, then swing backwards,\nat which point you drop the\nother grip [see picture 2].\nThis will probably end in painful tears the first time you\ntry, and from personal experience I know the grips tend to\ngravitate towards the more\ntender parts of your anatomy.\nIf you get it right, however,\nthe grip you dropped first will\ncontinue its arc around the\nback of your hand, ending up\nback in your palm, your hand\nremaining in contact with the\nchain (but not holding it) until\nit lands [see picture 3].\nSimply reverse the motion\nof the nunchuck to end up\nback where you started.\nOnce you have achieved\nthis, you can pass them across\nyour body \u2013 drop the nunchuck as before, and when\nthe first grip reaches your\npalm again, swing the entire\nthing across your body so that\nthe chain wraps around the\nback of your other hand, and\nthe other grip ends up in your\nother palm. Repeat ad infinitum [see pictures 4, 5 and 6].\nYou will notice that we have\nno idea how to hurt people\nwith these things, short of\nhitting them with a grip randomly during a pattern. If you\nintend to get attacked frequently with only two sticks\nand a chain between you\nand a good kicking, Imperial\nhas no shortage of martial\narts societies, and one will\ncertainly take your membership money. Alternatively,\nfor \u00a33 we can teach you how\nto look cool with these, and\nlet\u2019s face it, that\u2019s the more\nimportant aspect, right?\nEmail juggling@ic.ac.uk,\ncome along to juggling on any\nTuesday of term after 6pm\n(email for details) and I\u2019ll see\nyou next week for something\nelse that I can do but you\ncan\u2019t.\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE TWO: Nunchucka\n1. Start off with both \u2018sticks\u2019 in one hand, with the chain hanging down; 2. Allow the front grip to fall and swing\nbackwards, at which point drop the other grip; 3. The first grip will continue its arc around the back of your hand,\nending up back in your palm; 4-6. Do the same thing again, but this time swing the entire thing across your body...\nBy Zhi Lim\nOSC Chair\n2005. A new year. Another\nchance for the world to start\nafresh.\nThe past year has seen\nneedless death and destruction in many parts of the\nworld. From the continually\nincreasing superfluous death\ntolls in Iraq to the worst\nhumanitarian crisis in the\nworld caused by the civil war\nin Darfur, Western Sudan, we\nseem to enjoy the battering of\nour own human race. As if this\nwas not enough, nature has\ntaken a hand in the reduction\nof our head count with the\ndevastating tsunamis in the\nIndian Ocean. If only people\nwould stop fighting around\nthe world, then nature might\nnot need to remind us of our\nfrail existence.\nOnalighternote,theworld\u2019s\neconomy seems to be improving (before the tsunamis, that\nis). Many developing economies have been experiencing\ngrowth and rapid expansion.\nChina is, no doubt, the leader\nin terms of massive economic\nexpansion.\nIn the midst of these worldly\naffairs, it is reassuring to note\nthat certain less important\nbut joyous occasions do occur\nin some parts of the world:\nInternational Night 2005 is\nthe silver lining in the dark,\nheavy clouds.\nThis year\u2019s International\nNight (I-Nite) will prove to\nbe one of the better ones\nthat the world has seen so\nfar. At the top of the list, the\nfood fair promises a variety\nof international delicacies.\nWith more than ten amazing stalls (Singaporean, Sri\nLankan, Spanish, etc) to\ndelight the famished crowd\nfor the night, patrons will be\nspoilt for choice. Each ticket\nholder will be given three free\ncoupons to enjoy the spread\nof food. To complete the fabulous dining atmosphere for\nthe evening, a jazz and rock\nband will provide musical\naccompaniment.\nThe performance itself is\nan awesome showcase of a\nvariety of international cul-tures. With a huge range of\ndances, sketches and songs,\nthe show promises to live up\nto its reputation from previous year and seeks to outdo\nitself. Favourites include\na sketch by the Japanese\nSociety, dances by the AfroCaribbean Society and even\na musical by the Singapore\nSociety!\nSaving the best for the last,\nno performance night is complete without an after-show\nparty. Presenting a unique\nvenue for this year, the party\nwill blow your mind. With a\ncritically acclaimed DJ for\nthe night and a huge hall for\neverybody\u2019s dancing needs,\nit is time for everybody to do\na little performance of their\nown. In all, International\nNight 2005 promises to be\nthe landmark event of the\nyear!\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS\nCOMMITTEE\nInternational Night 2005\nInternational\nNight: always\na highlight in\nthe Imperial\nCollege\ncalendar\ns\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n\n"

The\ncombined firm could have\nrevenues of over $60bn a year.\n\u201cWe believe we can bring\nthese companies together and\ncreate a juggernaut,\u201d Gillette\nchief executive James Kilts\nsaid.\nThe two firms have 21 products worth over $1bn a year\nand own some of the best\nknown consumer brands in\nthe world. From Mach 3 shaving products to Head and\nShoulders shampoo, from\nDuracell batteries to Pringles\ncrisps, the new firm will have\nit covered.\nThe two firms\u2019 product\nranges complement each\nother \u2013 P&G\u2019s brands include\nmany products appealing to\nwomen with its wide range\nof beauty and hair care prod-ucts, while Gillette is a leader\nin the male grooming products sector.\nBy combining the two firms\u2019\nproduct ranges, they will have\na much higher combined\nmarketing budget and so will\nbe able to get better deals\nfrom media and advertising\ncompanies.\nIn recent times, supermarket chains have grown much\nlarger and have pushed their\nsuppliers to give them discounts on many products.\nWal-Mart, with 8% of the US\nretail market, and Tesco, with\n12% of the British retail mar-ket, have been very aggressive in driving down prices\nfrom their suppliers.\nP&G and Gillette hope to\nbe able to use their combined\npower to shift the balance of\npower with supermarkets,\nand use their combined size\nto get better prices and better\nsupermarket shelf space.\nThe two firms also hope to\nmakethemostofglobalisation\nby combining their strengths.\nP&G has a strong presence\nin emerging economies such\nas China and Russia and will\nuse this to promote Gillette\u2019s\nproducts. With the Chinese\nconsumer products market\nlooking to grow at 5-6% a\nyear, P&G hope to increase\nrevenue by over $350m just\nby selling Gillette\u2019s brands\nthere.\nAll in all, P&G hopes to cut\ncosts by $16bn a year, mainly\nby getting rid of 6,000 staff,\nwhich represents 4% of the\nnew company\u2019s workforce.\nThey also hope to raise operating margins from 19% to\n25% by the end of the decade.\nWarren Buffet, who owns\n9% of Gillette, has called it a\ndream deal. He plans to buy\nfurther into the new merged\ncompany.\nWhile the deal looks like a\nmatch made in heaven, especially since the two firms are\nlocated so close to each other\nand thus will avoid the cultural issues of integrating a\ncross border workforce, there\nare a few potential pitfalls. By\ngrowing through acquisition\nto such a large size, there\nmay be problems managing\na company of this size. This\nmerger is much bigger than\nthe purchase of Wella and\nClairol, other recent acquisitions that P&G have made.\nSome have also suggested that there is not much\nroom for extra profits from\nGillette\u2019s brands \u2013 consumers are unlikely to pay more\nmoney for more blades on\ntheir razor, and Gillette\u2019s\nDuracell is under pressure\nfrom lower cost rivals.\nBy making a $57bn offer for\nGillette, P&G are paying an\n18% premium over the stock\nmarket valuation of the firm.\nWhile this is generous, it is\nless than the 21% average\npremium offered in takeover\ndeals since 2001.\nMany analysts predict\nthat this will be the start of\na merger frenzy in the consumer products sector.\nBy creating such a large\ncombined firm, competitors\nare going to worry about their\nown future. They will look to\nmerge just to keep up with\nthe new firm. Speculation has\ndriven up the share price of\nthe French lighter, razor and\npen manufacturer Bic and\nthe British cleaning products\nfirm Reckitt Benckiser.\nMr Kilts, who will become\nthe vice-president of the new\nfirm, has said that he would\nrather lead this round of\nmergers than \u201cget stuck with\nthe leftovers\u201d.\n*Needlesstosay,thisimage,\nwhich we found in several\nplaces on the internet, is\ncompletely unofficial.\nGillette: another brand for Procter & Gamble to put under their belt, alongside dozens of other household names*\nLatest\nfrom the\nSquare\nMile\nBy Numaan Chaudhry\nBusiness Editor\nEuropean equities fly\nFollwing the \u2018successful\u2019 elections in Iraq, European equities reached two year highs.\nThe FTSE 100 closed at 4868,\na 0.7% increase from the\nlast weekend.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n27\nIt has been a while, but I am pleased\nto say that my faith in Hollywood\naction films has been restored. For\nwhen it comes down to good old-fashioned good guys versus bad\nguys with lots of heroics and guns,\nAssault on Precinct 13 delivers the\ngoods.\nA battered cop is charge of an\nequally battered police station that\nis \u2018enjoying\u2019 its last night before\npermanently closing its doors. That\nthis last night is New Years Eve during a nasty snowstorm means that\nit is going to be one long and hellish night for those trapped inside.\nAnd as mysterious forces try to get\ninside to kill the big time gangster in\nthe cells, all concerned have to put\ntheir issues aside if they are going\nto make it to the morning.\nThe story revolves around Marion\nBishop, a ruthless and intelligent\ngangster who has been arrested for\nkilling a policeman. He and three\nother small time criminals are\nforced to spend the night in Precinct\n13 when a freak blizzard causes\nthem to take a detour. Also spending\nthe night are the two policemen on\nduty, a feisty secretary and a slightly\nneurotic female psychologist.\nBishop, played by Fishburne is\ncoolly detached from those around\nhim, and Fishburne has the presence needed to carry off this new age\ngangster. He just looks innately evil\n\u2013 a very bad man who you wouldn\u2019t\nwant to meet on a dark night down a\ndark alley. His motivation is survival\nat any cost and you know that somewhere down the line he is going to\nmake a break for freedom.\nAll this contrasts beautifully with\nour hero, Jake Roenick (Hawke),\na young cop still reeling from a\ntraumatic incident involving lots of\ngunfire and the deaths of some of his\nfriends. His therapist thinks he is\nnow hiding from the world behind a\ndesk and losing himself in drugs and\nalcohol. She may just be right. Still,\nwe know better, because as soon as\nthe chips are down, Jake turns into\na super-duper champion of champi-ons, risking his own neck to save the\nlives of those innocents (and crooks)\nat the mercy of those outside. It\nis clich\u00e9d and corny I know, but I\nenjoyed it just the same.\nSo what follows is a heady mixture\nof explosions, gunshots through the\nhead \u2013 yes it is that violent \u2013 and\nmany utterances of \u201cwe\u2019re not going\nto make it, are we?\u201d It goes without\nsaying that in this kind of movie,\nmost of them aren\u2019t going to.\nAs I watched the cast dwindle in\nnumber in various interesting and\ninventive ways, the question I asked\nmyself is \u201cdo I really care?\u201d Well,\nthe director does do lot to create\nthree-dimensional characters that\nare both gritty and realist. He succeeds with the main characters but\nfalls behind with a few of the auxiliary cast.\nThe most disappointing is Gabriel\nByrne\u2019s character, who suffers from\na serious lack of development \u2013 his\ncorrupt cop comes across as totally\nunconvincing and flat. As with many\nmovies of this genre, a few chuckles\nare needed to lighten the violent\natmosphere. Here John Leguizamo\nis entertaining as a drugged-up\nex-lawyer whose sparing partner\nis adequately played by Jeffery \u2018Ja\nRule\u2019 Atkins, who also provides a\nbad-ass title soundtrack for the\nmovie. The director Jean-Francois\nRichet nicely blends the action with\nthe dialogue, although there is much\nmore action than anything else.\nIt is Ethan Hawke\u2019s performance as the lead that seals the deal\nfor me. Now fully immersed in the\naction drama genre, Hawke has\nthe \u2018washed up policeman with a\nconscience\u2019 down to a tee. I would\nlove to see him in more roles like\nthis, but I have the feeling that he\nwill soon return to more serious\ndrama.\nAs the story unwinds, a claustrophobic air is built up with many\ntight shots of scared faces and some\nslightly jumpy camera work. Tension\nis built up as the characters seem to\nbe sinking deeper into trouble with\nno way out. Still, I was drawn into\ntheir struggle for survival that fortunately was not too drawn out; a\ntendency of action films these days\nis to plug on for at least two hours\ntrying to reach some logical conclusion and often failing to do so.\nLuckily this doesn\u2019t happen here,\nand although you can guess what\nis going to happen at the film\u2019s end,\nthe journey there is still definitely\nworth watching. Yes it is violent, and\nwithout question bloody, but it\u2019s still\na lot of fun too.\nMandirassa Osakonor\nPrecinct 13: a prime example\nHollywood decides to remake John Carpenter\u2019s 1976 classic\nAssault on Precinct 13\nDirector: Jean-Francois Richet\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Laurence\nFishburne, Ja Rule, Gabriel Byrne\nLength: 109 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHI\nQuite literally \u2018off the cuff\u2019\nWell Fock me Sideways\nWine-loving wannabe writer Miles\n(Paul Giamatti) is taking failed actor\nJack (Haden Church) on a week-long tour of California\u2019s Santa Ynez\nValley wine region to celebrate his\nold friend\u2019s upcoming marriage.\nWhile Miles downs glass after\nglass of pinot noir, ruminating on\nhow difficult it is to grow that grape,\nJack is determined to get laid one\nlast time before settling down, so\nhe hustles Stephanie (Sandra Oh),\nthe wine pourer. Actually he seems\nto be hustling anything in a skirt for\nthat one last fling. Who is he going\nto find to have casual sex with?\nHe even convinces sad sack Miles\nto try his luck with Maya (Virginia\nMadsen), a sympathetic, wine-savvy\nwaitress. Miles steals money from\nhis mother to pay for his share of the\nwine, restaurants, and rooms. A pair\nof great guys?\nPredictably, Jack gets into trouble.\nEqually predictably, Miles comes to\nthe rescue while saving himself from\na mid-life crisis. These two characters are polar opposites: the crass\nactor and the sensitive writer, linked\nby being roommates at college, but\nby little else these days. Adapted\nby director Alexander Payne and\nJim Taylor, from the book by Rex\nPickett, Sideways\u2019 subtext is about\nfading youth and unfulfilled poten-tial, which is as depressing as a\nholiday film can get.\nAfter seeing the trailer for the film,\nI was very apprehensive about going\nto see it. Unfortunately watching the\nmovie only confirmed my suspicions.\nI didn\u2019t like the characters and I\ndidn\u2019t care about what happened to\nthem. But towards the end, the film\nbecomes funny in an unexpected\nway. Jack might be a fool, but he is\nhonest about it. He is so disarmingly\nfunny that you excuse his behaviour \u2013 he\u2019s just a self-involved actor.\nMiles, on the other hand, is someone\nto avoid at all costs. He is hunched\nover, depressed, angry, vengeful, and\nan unattractive little man.\nThere\u2019s something quite home\nmovie about the style of this film,\nand I loved the laid back sunny shots\nof the wine valley and the guys driving around. Sadly I\u2019m still confused\nabout the poor tribute to The Brady\nBunch \u2013 split screen effects aren\u2019t\nalways a good idea. I\u2019m not sure if\nPayne was trying to emphasise the\nlaid back attitude of the area with\nthe style and pace of the film, but\nperhaps the film\u2019s pace was too slow.\nIt was supposed to cover a week yet\nit felt like it was covering months\nand months of their lives. I lost count\nof the amount of times I was checking my watch.\nThe main problem I have with\nthis film is that it was full of lots\nof very cheap jokes that you will\nhave heard and seen before. Did we\nreally need to see a fat ugly naked\nguy with his pathetic excuse for\nmanhood pressed against the car\nwindow? Or the fat ugly naked guy\nhaving sex with his fat ugly naked\nwife?!\nI have to admit I did find parts\nquite funny and the rest of the audience seemed to love the film. It has\nbeen nominated for awards, so I\nguess I\u2019m in the minority on this\none. What annoys me is that most of\nthe movie was handled so clumsily\nthat it lost some of its impact. The\nonly saving grace is near the end\nwhen Payne directs some of the\nmore poignant scenes.\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just my age\nthat\u2019s preventing me from appreciating this film (a couple of forty-something losers aren\u2019t my idea of\nentertainment) \u2013 I don\u2019t understand\nthe hype. It\u2019s not a great movie, just\nan average one.

Let us know what you think at felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhat\u2019s uni supposed to be about?\nIt\u2019s about exams, studying and\nlearning become a useful member\nof the workforce, right? My bottom.\nIt\u2019s about having fun for the last\ntime in your life.\nRemember, once you get a job, you\nwon\u2019t be free until you\u2019re old. Very\nold in most cases. You should treasure the time you\u2019ve spent loafing at\nhome/watching movies/eating rub-bish. Uni is the place to have \u2018Good\nTimes\u2019 to treasure when you\u2019re\nolder. When else is it acceptable to\nbe eating a kebab at 3am having\njust finished a marathon of three\nseries of 24?\nThe difference between a student and a member of the workforce SHOULD be distinct. If you\nhave a job as a student, that\u2019s fine,\nbut its not what defines you. It\u2019s a\npart-time effort to scrape together\nsome money. Your life as a student\ndoes define you, and quite possibly the rest of your life. You learn\nto operate free of safety nets. Or\nat least you should do. You make\nmistakes, and you learn from them.\nThese mistakes should include, ide-ally, social life mistakes. You don\u2019t\nhave to drink, but if you do, you\nlearn not to spend all your loan\nin the first week on booze before\nresorting to whoring out your sorry\nass to many jobs, whilst missing lec-tures. Or at least hopefully you do.\nBut the fun is in the trying.\nThe point of university is that it\nteaches you to live. It teaches you\nhow to organise your time so that\nyou can work and play. There\u2019s no\npoint in just working, because then\nyou miss out on the bigger pic-ture. That\u2019s why clubs and societies\nare put forward as being important\n\u2013 no-one wants automatons who\ndo nothing but work. Even in job\ninterviews, extra-curricular activities are major things \u2013 flexibility\nand juggling are crucial to employ-ers. And frankly, if you have only\none string to your bow, how much\ncan you possibly add to the job? You\nneed to be able to think outside the\nbox quite frequently nowadays (if\nonly to get through stupid questionnaires for application forms), and\nthat requires a life full of diverse\nexperience.\nSo, the moral? Get out, do stuff,\nput something back into the university and its social life. Remember,\nfor every effort you put in, you get\neight times that amount back. That\u2019s\nguaranteed*, and also remember\nyou get paid for most fun stuff*.\nBut seriously, just get out there and\ndo stuff. Be more than a candidate\nnumber.\n* May not be true.\nTaking back the streets\nby TRISTAN LANE\nWith the girl about town\u2019s monthly\nbible (aka Glamour magazine) quoting that there are 50,000 more single women aged 20-34 than men in\nLondon, at least the pulling ratios\nat Imperial College should still\nbe working in an attractive medic\nlady\u2019s favour. Such a girl should be\nspoken for, having taken the pick\nof the men, considering the lack of\ncompetition, and quality competition at that.\nAlas, it turns out that fate and logic\nare both cruel, and my extremely\nattractive friends and I have realised we are the single survivors of\nthe fourth year.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019d sympathise that\nmoving back to London after a\nhectic Christmas on reception in\nan incestuous country hospital\ncan only be a good thing. Youthful,\noverweight rural fogeys, and their\nolder, blithering Barbour-wearing\ncounterparts don\u2019t count among my\nwide and wonderful array of fetishes\n\u2013 and a Saturday hunt is not my idea\nof a date!\nI had barely unpacked my bags,\nwhen flatmate one (I have two,\none of whom is sensibly taken by\na worthy guy and doesn\u2019t partake\nin the hormonally crazed madness)\nspotted victim number one for me:\nhot Australian dreadlock boy, best\nknown as the tradesman from the\nflat upstairs. I have a well-publi-cised weakness for the laid back\nsurfer look, which stopped me from\nwasting this golden opportunity\nfor the perfect fling of convenience\n(he lives upstairs for goodness\nsakes!)\nI spoke to the previous occupant\n\u2013 a good friend of mine, also out on\nthe pull \u2013 and she mentioned he\nwas an Aussie called Dan who lived\non the top floor, in flat 21... and that\nI wouldn\u2019t find him especially fit.\nI chose to go for the conventional\napproach: waiting to cross paths\nunexpectedly in a sedate but friendly manner.\nUnfortunately, flatmate number\none had other ideas. She kept bumping into Dan repeatedly within the\nhallwaysthroughouttheweek.Seven\ndays passed, and I\u2019d seen absolutely\neveryone in the building, their children and au pairs (still no fitness,\nwith the inhabitants mostly female\nand prissy) but no Dan! Drunkenly\ngiggly, desperately horny and tarted\nup after a raucous bitching session\nthat evening, I found my way to the\ntop floor and knocked on one of the\ndoors, ready to introduce myself\nwith the ultimate punchline: \u201cHey,\nI\u2019ve just moved into the building and\nthought I\u2019d pop by and say \u2018hi\u2019. I\u2019m\nalso mates with Helen who used to\nlive here too, and she told me Dan\nwas worth introducing myself to. Is\nhe in?\u201d\nUnprepared for the inevitable\n\u201cwho\u2019s Dan?\u201d I ended up describing him using the precious little\nI knew, which was blurted out as\n\u201csexy dreadlock guy\u201d.\nI was helpfully directed to Dan\u2019s\nflat, and so, on my third deep breath,\namidst a lot of giggling, I introduced\nmyself to a portly, defensive, slightly\nbovine female with Jerry Springer\nBBQ Supernoodle hair. I had difficulty keeping a straight face, bearing in mind this introduction was\nfollowed by the Spanish inquisition\ninto how I knew Dan, where I knew\nhim from and what I wanted to\ndo with him! Incidentally, he wasn\u2019t\nhome that night.\nI broke into more giggles and\nended up mentioning Helen, my\nextremely fit friend who\u2019d just left\nthe flat. This left the sex-starved\nmunter further perplexed, and I\nbeat a hasty, drunken, not-so gracious retreat, collapsing in laughter\nas I slid down the carpet of four\nsets of stairs. Bumpy rides are fun,\naren\u2019t they?\nThis particular bumpy ride continued when Dan continued to bump\ninto flatmate number one, and stare\nlongingly into her eyes, three times\na day for the next week. Matters\nweren\u2019t helped when his flatmate\ntold him a giggly little Asian girl was\non the lookout for him, and that all\nour flatmates fitted that description.\nFlatmate one\u2019s descriptions of Dan\ngot progressively less appealing on\na daily basis, and by the time day ten\nrolled round after another drunken\nbitching session, curiosity killed the\ncat \u2013 he couldn\u2019t be ugly and intrigu-ing, could he?\nA new friend had arrived to join us\nfor the evening, and so, dressed in\nher winter coat with umbrella and\nwrongly written address in tow, we\nsent her upstairs to ask for directions to number 23 (we have 22 flats\nin our building). She was instructed\n(amidst peals of laughter) to miss-call us if Dan answered, and on\ndoing so, we\u2019d ring her and tell her\nwe were coming to pick her up,\nwhilst legging it up the stairs dou-ble-time! Since she struck it lucky\nthere, and Dan himself answered\nthe door, weeks of anticipation came\nto a head. But within this mighty\nrush, I\u2019d forgotten to do up my trousers and fallen over my very own\ndoorstep.\nDan ended up showing my friend\nthe way to ours, leading to the\nbiggest disappointment and most\nuncontainable giggling session of\nmy entire life!

    "content": "Think Floyd: pick Mason\nMartin Smith, Books Editor, takes a trip to the dark side to explore some Floydian theory\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nChristmas 2004 saw two different drummers from world famous\nprehistoric rock bands give their\nthoughts in book format. However,\nwhile Ringo Starr dug out his loft\nonly to find some Postcards from\nthe Boys, Nick Mason has managed\nto offload the entire story of Pink\nFloyd into one beautiful hardback\nbook.\nFor those of you who skim-read\nthe first paragraph, Pink Floyd are,\nor perhaps were, a very successful band that your Dad listened to\nwhile smoking dope in the sixties,\nseventies and beyond. Actually, my\nDad wasn\u2019t much of a fan, but I\u2019m\nmaking up for his philistine tendencies by becoming the greatest fan\nof Pink Floyd the world has ever\nknown.\nPink Floyd are most famous\nfor their 1973 album Dark Side of\nthe Moon, which at one point was\nclaimed to exist in three out of four\nrecord collections. And rightly so:\nit\u2019s fantastic. Other things you may\nbe aware of are their enigmatic\nalbum covers, which have included\ncows, light refraction and Battersea\npower station. It is for this reason\nin particular that, even being the\ndie-hard fan that I am, I could still\nwalk past Messrs Mason, Gilmour,\nWaters and Wright without even\nrecognising them. I\u2019m just proud I\nremember their names. Very few\nlater albums featured pictures of the\nband, and even at the time Mason\nrecalls gangs of photographers still\npoised with their fingers on the\nbuttons well after they had got off\nthe plane, unlike the Beatles and\nRingo Starr. This makes this personal account all the more interest-ing, as tabloid newspapers haven\u2019t\nbeen gossiping about their rivalries\nand musical differences. They just\nweren\u2019t pretty enough.\nNick Mason had the pleasure of\nbeing part of the \u2018Pink Floyd Sound\u2019\nfrom the very beginning and to the\nvery end. Several key band members came and went in the 30 years\nor so that Pink Floyd performed, for\nmusical or mental health reasons,\nand Mason documents their comings and goings from the relative\nsafety of his drum throne. One of\nthe most interesting things about\nthe Floyd is the way in which their\nmusic changes over time: musical \u2018phases\u2019 are certainly identifiable from one member leaving and\nanother taking control. It\u2019s a heartwarming story of a a group of failing architects who decide to pick\nup some musical instruments and\nbegin to hate each other.\nI was quite surprised at the way\nthis book was written. Mason, whilst\nobserving the happenings of the\nsixties and seventies, appears to\nhave avoided any of the mind-bend-ing pharmaceuticals of the period,\nand so is presumably one of the\nfew musicians of the era who can\nremember what happened. Whether\nor not this is to protect his children\nfrom seeing his naughty side, we\nstill get a good account of the psychedelia but from a remarkably sober\nperspective. He also manages to\nanswer the question \u2018Where did the\nband get its name\u2019 without making\nyou feel as though he\u2019s explained a\nthousand times before. The answer,\nfor use in pub quizzes, is that it\u2019s a\nmixture of two blues artists, Pink\nAnderson and Floyd Council, who\nwere favoured by Syd Barrett at\nthe time. I think that question even\ncame up in Trivial Pursuit once.\nSomething else that you can\u2019t fail\nto pick up from this book is the\nfact that Nick is far more interested in music technology, cars and\nmotor racing than he is in drums.\nHe focuses on the technological\nimprovements that allowed Pink\nFloyd to continue to put on the\nbest light shows of every period and\nproduce the most refined sound in\nrock history.\nThe book is a delight to read.\nIt\u2019s huge and weighs a ton (much\nlike a Floyd tour) and is decorated\nwith hundreds of photos, some of\nwhich make their first appearance\nhere from his personal collection.\nIts glossy pages and Floydian cover,\ncourtesy of Storm Thorgerson, are\na joy to behold, and these alone\nwould make it a fantastic coffee\ntable book for anyone wanting to\nlook musically cultured. However, if\nthis is your thing, I can well recommend Mind Over Matter, an equally well presented and significantly\ncheaper book which documents the\nimages of Pink Floyd, in particular\nalbum covers that were consistently\nprovided by Storm over the band\u2019s\nlifetime.\nIf you\u2019re after the full story\nfrom the man holding the sticks/\nfourtrack/racing helmet then this\nis the book to buy. Start saving now:\nI was lucky enough to convince my\nDad to spend the \u00a330 to make it an\nexcellent Christmas present. I take\nit all back.\nInside Out: A Personal\nHistory of Pink Floyd\nby Nick Mason\n(Weidenfeld & Nicolson)\nHardcover\nHHHHI\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005 25\nUganda in 1977, Afghanistan 1980,\nEl Salvador 1981, Kosovo 1999 and\nIraq 2003 were not popular tourist\ndestinations, yet these are some of\nthe places Jon Snow has visited\nduring a remarkable news reporting career, and after reading his\nautobiography, you almost feel sorry\nfor him stuck behind a desk fronting\nChannel 4 News.\nShooting History is a fascinating,\nhonest, and at times moving account\nof Snow\u2019s journalist life which adds\nup to more than just an autobi-ography. For anyone interested in\nforeign news reporting, it is \u2013 yes \u2013 a\n\u2018must read\u2019. Rich with anecdotes of\nfrontline bullet-dodging and being\narrested in obscure corners of the\nworld, it also informs us of what\noverseas news gathering was like\nbefore reliable telephone networks\nand the internet.\nBut this book is also an historical\naccount of the Cold War and its consequences from a unique viewpoint.\nAs a foreign news reporter who\nbecame Washington correspondent then diplomatic editor for ITN,\nSnow had a ring-side seat as the\nmajor events of the late 20th century\nunfolded. Throughout this autobiog-raphy, he persuasively argues that\nthe West helped create the Islamist\nterrorist threat that so preoccupies\nit today \u2013 from El Salvador, Iran\nand Afghanistan to 9/11, Shooting\nHistory describes how all the pieces\nmoved together to create our current world disorder and the war on\nterror.\nThe son of an Anglican bishop,\nSnow begins his book at the large\nfamily residence before describing\nthe choir-boy schooling that failed\nto get him the grades he needed for\nuniversity. Instead, he travelled to\nUganda on VSO, where he spent a\nyear teaching in a remote Catholic\nschool.\nThe book vividly describes Snow\u2019s\nlife in rural Africa and how he settled into his teacher role in the com-munity. Desperately sad to leave,\nthe experience obviously had a\ngreat impact on him and appears\nto have sown the first seeds of a\npotential journalism career: a realisation of the injustice in the world\nmade him determined to return to\nthe country to report back on it.\nInterestingly, while serving VSO, he\nencountered an extremely large,\nambitious Ugandan general fresh\nout of Sandhurst at a local boxing tournament. It was a few years\nbefore Snow got another chance to\nmeet Idi Amin and interview him, by\nwhich time the Uganda he returned\nto was almost unrecognisable from\nthe country he had fallen in love\nwith.\nUpon returning from Africa,\nSnow started a degree at Liverpool\nUniversity. He makes no secret of\nthe fact that it was his father\u2019s contacts that got him onto a course,\nbut unfortunately they did not bear\nfruit. Snow remains degree-less to\nthis day, his time at Liverpool having\ncome to an abrupt end following his\ninvolvement with a student protest\nthat culminated in a takeover of\na university building. Although not\nresponsible for raising the red flag\non its roof, Snow was accused of\nbeing one of the ringleaders responsible for the demonstration and was\nsuspended.\nFollowingaheart-breakingaccount\nof a stint at a London homeless\ncharity, the book goes on to describe\nSnow\u2019s first media break at LBC\nradio, and from then on takes us on\na journey of foreign news reporting\nacross Central America, the Middle\nEast and Africa. During this period,\nSnow gained first-hand experience\nof fighting amongst the Cold War\u2019s\npolitical pawns as he reported on\nEl Salvador, Iran-Iraq and Somalia.\nLater, as ITN\u2019s Washington and then\ndiplomatic correspondent, Snow\nreported on the Reagan-Gorbachov\nsummits and the fall of the Berlin\nWall from the unique position of having directly experienced the effects\nof cold war tensions on the ground.\nThroughout his career, his list\nof interviewees is impressive and\nincludes Gorbachov, Reagan and\nthe Pope. But perhaps standing out\nmost is Nelson Mandela, who, as\nthe new president of South Africa,\ngave his first interview to Jon Snow.\nObviously a proud moment, it also\nseems somehow fitting because\nSnow was arrested and charged\nfollowing protests for Mandela\u2019s\nrelease at an England-South Africa\nrugby match during his student\ndays years earlier.\nThroughout Shooting History,\nSnow is candid \u2013 and not just in\nacknowledging his luck and the\n\u201cI think your father taught me at\nEton\u201d connections that served him\nwell. We hear his genuine regret at\nthe way the press ignored Rwanda\nuntil over a million people had been\nkilled in its mass genocide. He, like\nthe rest of the world\u2019s media, was\nscrambling after Monica Lewinsky.\nWhile the world was obsessed by\na young White House intern and\n\u201cthe Dress\u201d, the hundreds of bodies\nwashing up on the shores of Lake\nVictoria went largely unreported.\nThe book finishes with a passionate plea for the UN dream to be\nrekindled, and a heavy criticism\nof George Bush\u2019s foreign policies.\nHere, Snow\u2019s feeling of impotency\nas a newsreader becomes apparent\nas he grabs his chance to explicitly\nsay what he thinks about the war on\nIraq. This is not an anti-American\nrant: it is obvious from the book that\nwhen living there as Washington\ncorrespondent he loved America, its\npeople and the ideologies on which\nthe country was founded. Perhaps\nthat is why he is so disturbed by\nthe direction in which America is\nheaded.\nShooting History is not only a\nfascinating autobiography, but also\nan insightful commentary on the\nlatter half of the cold war and the\nchallenges we face today. From his\nunique news reporting experiences,\nJon Snow has attempted to put our\ncurrent war on terror into the wider\ncontext of cold war history \u2013 and\nsucceeded.\nShooting History:\nA Personal Journey\nby Jon Snow\n(Harper Collins)\nHHHHI\nSnow storm\nJon Snow, familiar to us all as an intrepid ITN news reporter, shares his life story with Iain Taylor, and\nindeed anyone else who reads Shooting History\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 February 2005 7\nLeaflet litter\nDear all,\nI would like to make an appeal to\nClub and Society Event Officers\nand students alike concerning the\nincreasing problem of \u2018leafleting\u2019\nand the damage it does to the environment and our college premises.\nWalking along the walkway this\nweek I have being abhorred to see\nso much litter besmirching it; much\nof this litter is club and society relat-ed, usually pamphlets advertising\nevents etc, yet for the most part\nall they seem to do is litter the\nfloor. Can I ask all clubs and societies to think more carefully about\ntheir advertising methods \u2013 blanketing the walkway with posters and\nthrusting leaflets into uninviting\nhands does not get more people\nto come to your events, indeed the\nirritation caused is likely to have the\nreverse affect.\nSmaller, more personal, focused\ncampaigns have a much greater\nsuccess rate. Perhaps a table on the\nwalkway, in the JCR or the Union\nentrance with relevant posters\naround it, a few information leaflets and some friendly people using\nthere skills of perception to target\nlikely individuals would have much\nmore success. Not all clubs and\nsocieties are to blame I have seen\nsome using these \u2018more focused\u2019\ntechniques with great success.\nAgain for general campus wide\nadvertising perhaps approaching\nFelix (or any of the other smaller\ncampus and department newslet-ters) with an interesting article\nabout something you have done\nwould be a more suitable technique\nor approaching specific departmental societies or even other clubs,\nwhich you think maybe interested\n\u2013 and obviously at our college do not\nforget the power of the website!\nIf this situation is not curtailed, I\ncall for fellow students to campaign\nto the union to enforce rules on its\nclubs and societies about litter crea-tion, those clubs found to be printing leaflets and due to over-force-ful advertising causing the littering\nof our building should be punished\n\u2013 perhaps by fining them or reducing the part of their budget relating\nto printing which is clearly not being\nused effectively.\nFinally it is also not only clubs and\nsocieties to blame but students as\nwell, upon being given these leaflets\nmany of us just drop them without\na care, can you please drop them in\nthe next bin instead, even if you\u2019re\nnot interested \u2013 there are several bins on the walkway and in the\nUnion, this is about the easiest way\nto do your bit for the environment\nand to make college a more aesthetically pleasing place to study.\nThank you\nThe Disgruntled Geologist\n\u2018Atheism\u2019 posters\nDear Editor,\nIn response to the letter sent to\nFelix (published in issue 1313 on\n27th January) on the Atheism post-ers, I would like to give my response\nas a Christian and also as a scien-tist/engineer on the campus.\nAs the author of that letter has\nnoted, this is primarily a science\ncollege. To this end I believe that we\npossess the ability to have discussions and debates about any subject,\nregardless of how sensitive, in a\ncalm and rationale manner.\nWhile it is unfortunate that the\n\u2018Life\u2019 poster and flyers had an assertive statement on them as opposed\nto a question for debate, it still raises\na valid point for debate and discus-sion. There are two mutually exclusive views here: the Christians who\nput up the poster, along with me,\nwho believe that Atheism cannot\ndeliver, and the atheists who would\ncertainly believe that Christianity\ncannot deliver.\nWe could all sit in our respective\ncamps and keep issuing insults and\nderogatory statements about each\nother, but I\u2019m sure a dialogue would\nbe far more beneficial for all. To that\nend, I believe the course that the\nChristian Union is makes an excellent forum for such discussions as it\nis meant to allow a no holds barred\ndiscussion.\nAlso, I would also like to raise\nthe question of why religion makes\nthis college look farcical? There are\nmany scientists out there who are\nChristians, and many more who\nbelieve in the existence of \u2018a god\u2019.\nI have, to date, seen no proof that\natheists make better scientists than\nChristians or any other person who\nbelieves in the existence of \u2018a god\u2019.\nRegards,\nEdric Margono\nPhD Student\nDept of Chemical Engineering\nTo publish or not to publish?\nDear Editor,\nI was delighted to read in your reply\nto the letter \u2018Fun in Felix\u2019 two weeks\nago that anyone is welcome to write\nfor Felix and that the lack of funny\narticles appearing at present was\ndue to all the comedy writers having stopped writing. This came as\na great relief to me because I had\ngained the impression that you had\nsimply stopped publishing some\nwriters\u2019 work. A little bird told me\nthat recently you refused to publish\nany more articles from a Mr Rupert\nNeate, a name that will not be that\nfamiliar to your readers as he has\nonly written one article for Felix so\nfar, however that was the front page\narticle about the knifing in Chelsea.\nYour reason for refusing him a regu-lar, humorous column (I have read\nthe first one he did and it was very\nfunny) about student life was, appar-ently, that you learnt that he was\nintending to run for Felix editor. You,\nI believe, claimed that it would be\nunfair to other candidates to allow\nhim a column so that he could publicise himself before the elections.\nMr Neate, feeling hard done by\n(justifiably so in my opinion), went\nto the returning officer, a certain Mr\nArif, to ask about this situation. Mr\nArif informed him that though he\ncould have a very good case to take\nto the elections committee ultimately you could still simply say that you\nwould not put his articles in as they\nwere not good enough.\nIn fact Mr Neate did have an article\nwhich would have fitted nicely into\nyourbusiness/politics/sciencepaper,\nit was an interview with the Liberal\nDemocrat candidate for Kensington\n& Chelsea in which she discussed\nher defection from the Tory party\nand her views on students and the\ndemolition of Southside but apparently you rejected this as it wasn\u2019t\nrelevant till the elections, and there\nwas I thinking that politics went on\nall year round, silly, silly me!\nIf any of the facts I have stated in\nthis letter are wrong please feel free\nto correct me in a nice long answer\non the Felix letters page. Now I\nmust stop because there is a fascinating article about construction\nprojects on page 12 of Felix that I\nsimply must read, oh wait a minute,\nactually it\u2019s not that interesting!\nYours Sincerely\nIain Heaton\n3rd year Biologist\nDave Edwards, Editor, replies:\nI am pleased to take this opportunity to explain my position and\ncorrect many of the so-called \u2018facts\u2019\nin the above letter.\nFirstly, I am addressing the \u201clack\nof funny articles\u201d this week by publishing two new columns on page\n8.\nAs for Mr Neate, he told me that\nhe was standing for Felix Editor,\nand then asked for a regular col-umn. Because the elections had just\nopened, and Mr Neate had only\never written one piece for Felix, I\ninterpreted this as blatant electioneering and refused his request.\nIt would be impossible to allow\ncandidates to have regular columns\nat this stage \u2013 they could all ask for\none in order to raise their profile,\neven if they did not specifically\nmention elections. Also, it would be\nvery unfair to give the impression\nthat someone is a regular contributor to Felix when in fact they are\nnot. I have discussed this with two\nformer Felix Editors, both of whom\ncompletely agree with my decision.\nThe Returning Officer, Mustafa\nArif, said on reading the above let-ter: \u201cI never told him [Mr Neate] he\nwould have a good case. I said he\ncould take it to Elections Committee\nif he wanted, but my opinion was\nthat he would not have enough evidence.\u201d\nThe Editor of Felix is totally\nresponsible for all content and has\nthe right to rule out any submission.\nHowever, I have never \u201crefused to\npublish any more articles\u201d from\nanyone. I have told Mr Neate that\nhe is welcome to contribute in several different ways. In fact, he has\nwritten an article on page 26 of\nthis week\u2019s issue. He is welcome to\nwrite a regular column as soon as\nthe election is over, if he so wishes.\nI very much look forward to reading Mr Neate\u2019s interview with the\nLiberal Democrat candidate for\nKensington and Chelsea, which\nwill of course be printed in Felix if\nI receive it.\nMr Neate offered me \u201cinterviews\nwith prospective parliamentary\ncandidates\u201d. Of course politics goes\non all year round, but it is a question of when the issues are most\nrelevant to our readers. I believe\nthe interviews will be at their most\nuseful and interesting when the\ngeneral election is at the forefront\nof people\u2019s minds and when our\nreaders are making their final decisions on who to vote for. I hope that\nthe interviews will form an integral\nand interesting part of our general\nelection coverage in late April and\nearly May.\nFinally, I sincerely hope that Mr\nHeaton enjoyed last week\u2019s article\non construction projects. Sadly, we\nhave no plans to print any similar\narticles in the near future.\n\u25cf The full list of candidates\nfor Felix Editor in the forthcoming election is as follows:\nSimon Clark, Rupert Neate,\nDarius Nikbin, Martin Smith\nLetters to the Editor\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk by 10pm Monday. This is the page where you can make your voice heard on just about\nany topic. Letters may be edited for length but not for spelling or grammar, and are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion\nSir Richard and the environment\nWhat does the Rector really think about green issues at Imperial, asks Joseph Bull\nA number of articles have appeared\nin Felix devoted to an issue that is\npresently at the forefront of world\npolitics: the issue of environmental\nconcern. I would also like to reveal\nthat a number of students have been\ncarrying out a small and simple\nsurvey this year, asking Imperial\nstudents and staff whether or not\nthey agree that the College should\nreduce its environmental impact\nand implement an environmental management system. Almost\nwithout exception, they do. What,\nthen, does our venerable Rector,\nImperial\u2019s figurehead, have to say\non the matter?\nLast Thursday, there was an\nopportunity to find out, as the\nRector held his annual open \u2018face\nto face\u2019. During his initial presenta-tion, Sir Richard mentioned the possibility of an amalgamation of all of\nImperial\u2019s strands of environmental\nresearch and the possibility of a\nheavier emphasis on this particular\nsubject. Consequently, he was asked\nwhat environmental policies and initiatives accompanied this research\nand how they applied to the running\nof Imperial. More specifically, had\nany environmental measures come\nto fruition?\nLong and genial answers were\nduly supplied; however, not a single\nspecific example was given, at odds\nwith the request. This is the Rector\nwhen he speaks publicly to students.\nHe is friendly and calm, sharp and\nintelligent; however, his answers\ncan be exceptionally indirect and\neven avoid the thrust of the question\ncompletely. He is the quintessential\npolitician.\nLater on, following similar ques-tioning, he finally gave an example of a way in which Imperial has\nattempted to improve its environmental image and culture: through\na series of lectures on green topics\nthat were run recently in conjunction with LSE.\nNow first of all, this seems an\nodd choice of a shining example of\nImperial\u2019s commitment to the environment (what other groundbreaking initiatives have we spearheaded,\nyou may well ask?) But, more impor-tantly, it is interesting to note that\nupon further investigation, it seems\nthe College had little to do with the\norganisation of these lectures, rath-er, they were chiefly orchestrated by\nthe humble student Environmental\nSociety! If I am wrong, I apologise\nin advance, but the only evidence of\nlectures like these was to be found\non the ESoc website. Now either\nthe Rector was unaware of this, and\nthus perhaps unaware of, and disinterested in, the college\u2019s environmental actions in general, or he was\ntrying to mislead and appease the\nenvironmentalists who were asking\nthe questions. It was thus only natural that it was asked, directly, what\nit is he personally feels about these\nenvironmental concerns: \u201cI think\nthey are very important.\u201d That, at\nleast, is encouraging to know.\nThe environment is something a\nnumber of students and staff have\ndemonstrated feeling over, and\nthe College is responding. Those\nin attendance were assured that\nan energy policy is forthcoming in\nFebruary and an environmental\npolicy by the end of the year. This,\nincidentally, will bring us up to the\nlevel of other top universities (we\nappear to be the only one in the\ntop ten without either policy), and I\nhave to agree with the Rector that,\nin general, \u201c...we cannot allow ourselves to be outflanked by Oxford\nand Cambridge.\u201d\nImperial College has also just\nhad a \u2018preliminary environmental\nreview\u2019, which has clearly laid out\nareas of substantial environmental\nimpact and made recommendations\nfor improvement.\nTo conclude, while the College is\nstill at present known for its lack of\nenvironmental concern, and there is\nmuch that could be done, action is\npromised in the near future. As for\nour Rector, he is genial enough and\nno fool, and he apparently considers\nthe environment (and student welfare in general) important, but still\nseems to cloak his true feelings and\nintentions in rhetoric, giving students little chance to know, under-stand, or, crucially, trust him.\n\n"
