The decorative designs sparkled on the lehengas,\ncontrasting with dark tones or adding a\ntouch of shimmer to the light ones. As an\namateur Garba dancer, I focused on the\nexpert dancers whom I identified by their\nunique atire. The girl in the dark red le-henga commanded with grace while the\ngirl in the light green-yellow outfit was\nthe one to look to for guidance later on.\nThe dances consisted of a few rhythmic steps repeated every few seconds,\ngenerally moving the entire crowd back\nand forth in the same direction. Requiring at least a few dozen people, the first\ndance started at roughly 7.30pm when\nthe first guests arrived. In a three-step\nrhythm, every part of the body was in-volved: hands slapped each other in an\nup-and-down fashion, knees bent slightly to maintain balance, and heels kicked\nback and forth. Throughout the night it\nbecame evident that a half-rotating twist\nwas common to every dance. As a begin-ner, the steps were very easy to follow\n\u2013 not crashing into others was the chal-lenge. The dancers moved like a deep river in the mountains \u2013 constant with a lot\nof movement and power. As the outer circles filled with clapping students, the inner circles emerged and took the form of\nthree concentric circles. When I became\nexhausted, I had to swiftly manoeuvre\nmyself through the crowd to find a place\nto rest.\nChaiiwala catered the event, providing drinks such as lemonade, chai and\nchai coffee, as well as cookies and warm\nsnacks to satisfy the mass of hungry and\nexhausted dancers. I tried the iced chai\ncoffee, and within minutes it was gone.\nAs the second dance began, the difficulty rose. In a filled circle, everyone took\ntwo steps to the left, twisted quickly, took\nthree steps to the right and turned. I took\nsome time to gaze at the beauty of the\nGarba Night from the DJ stage, and was\nastounded by the coherency of 300 or so\nstudents. The party was purely for dance,\nfun and spending time with friends. For\na moment, it felt as though I was not in\nLondon. Although I have never been to\nIndia, and I cannot quite say I have after\nGarba, I do feel more confident visiting\nafter my experience. As opposed to the\nintimidating, complex dances of my cul-ture, the Bavarian-Austrian opera balls, I\nfelt very welcome to dance the Garba.\nComing into the event without much\nknowledge of Hindu culture, I was - and\nstill am - so pleased with the educational\nexperience. I socialised with people from\nLSE and Imperial, who taught me about\ntraditional jewelry and how to use Dandiya sticks. Next year, I will bring along my\nfriends. Will you join us?\nUntil next time,\n-Charlotte\nThe statue dedicated to Goddess Gurda. Shravan Sharma / Event Photographer\nOver 300 people attended wearing outfits with incredible style.

It\nwould have been perfect, had I not naively refused to pack a warm jacket for\nthe walk down in the shade of the adjacent mountain, and caught an awful cold.\nAll I knew was one thing: if food be thy med-icine, then my medicine should be ginger-tur-meric shots \u2013 with a pinch of apple.\nThe Recipe\nAs the name already suggests, the ingredients\nfor this concoction are very simple. Ginger - a powerhouse for anti-inflammation and nausea relief -helps soothe the sore throat. Turmeric has the micro-nutrient curcumin, which also provides\nanti-inflammation and pain relief. Lemons and oranges\nboth provide 100mg of vitamin C per large fruit, the recommended daily intake. Apple juice mitigates the\nstrong taste of ginger and turmeric, while providing\nan extra boost of vitamin C. Optionally, honey or\nagave can be added for sweetness.\nThe apple should be cut to remove the seeds,\nwhile any dirty crevices of the ginger and turmeric branches should be cleaned off.\nHomemade vs store bought\nWhen reviewing six different brands of ginger shots, the price ranges from \u00a32.33 to \u00a33.75\nper 100ml serving, and from \u00a31.40 to \u00a32.25\nper 60ml serving. This does seem reasonable;\nhowever, the ingredients for the homemade\nshots cost \u00a31.54 in Sainsbury\u2019s, or roughly 25p per\n60ml serving.

It must condemn the attacks\nof Hamas and reassure its Jewish community,\nwhile also acknowledging the decades of injustice\nfaced by Palestinians.\nIn theory, it is possible to do all of this, but the\nCollege\u2019s communications thus far show how difficult\nit is to talk about this issue without upsetting one\nparty or another.\nImperial\u2019s first messages tried to play things safe,\nas details of Hamas\u2019s attack emerged. \u2018Our thoughts\nare with all those affected by the escalating violence\nin Israel and Gaza,\u2019 it said in a message on X, formerly\nTwitter. Provost Ian Walmsley followed, tweeting,\n\u2018Our Imperial community stands as one against acts\nof violence and hatred,\u2019 and expressing his shock at\nthe \u2018appalling violence in Israel and Gaza\u2019.\nThe College\u2019s attempts at taking the centre ground\nbackfired, when on Friday 13th October, it received\na series of open letters from Jewish and Israeli\nstudents, staff and alumni. \u201cWe do not understand\nwhy Imperial hasn\u2019t condemned Hamas\u2019s heinous\nacts,\u201d they wrote, accusing Imperial of downplaying\n\u201cthese atrocities\u201d, and calling its statements \u201can\naffront to our dignity.\u201d\nHours after the letter was published, Brady sent a\nstatement to all College members, calling out \u2018This\nweek\u2019s terrible attacks by Hamas\u2019 and the escalation\nof violence in Gaza\u201d.\nHe followed it up with an address at Imperial\u2019s\ngraduation ceremony, acknowledging \u201cthe terrorist\nattacks in in Israel and the rapidly escalating conflict\nand humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s blockade and shelling of\nthe Gaza Strip was exacerbating the existing\nhumanitarian crisis in the region.\nSpeaking this week, one student with Palestinian\nheritage called Brady\u2019s comments \u201cdisgraceful\u201d,\ntaking issue with his framing of events and the\n\u201cpassive\u201d language he used. His address, she said,\nruined her graduation. Another Palestinian-heritage\nstudent described Imperial\u2019s response as \u201ca bowl\nfull of nothing\u201d.\nBrady is not alone in his woes. The problem\nthe College faces is a microcosm of a wider one\nfacing institutions across the world. Labour leader\nSir Keir Starmer found himself in hot water after\ncomments he made about Israel\u2019s right to defend\nitself, and blockade Gaza landed poorly with Muslim\ncommunities. And UN Chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\nexpressed his shock after Israel accused him of\n\u2018justifying acts of terror\u2019. Guterres had said Hamas\u2019s\nattacks had not occurred in \u2018a vacuum\u2019, and that the\n\u2018Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years\nof suffocating occupation.\u2019\nSo, where does Imperial go from here? There is,\nunfortunately, no easy answer. It could have said\nnothing \u2013 anything it does say this subject will\nanger somebody.\nBut then it would have faced accusations of\ncallousness. Some Imperial students have been\naffected directly by the events of the past few\nweeks, and would undoubtedly take issue with such\nan approach.\nIt must therefore condemn the atrocities that have\nbeen committed by both Israel and Hamas, and\nremain sensitive to the concerns of affected College\nmembers. It will inevitably face accusations of bias,\nand must therefore engage directly with students,\nstaff, and alumni to understand why they are upset.\n\n"

But\nwhen writing up reports, I struggled to\njustify investing time into these areas as\nI realised there were more fundamental\nflaws in the recycling system \u2013 these being consumer behaviour and waste collection methods.\nIn school, the concept of the three R\u2019s\nwas drilled into my brain \u2013 reduce, re-use, recycle, reduce, reuse, recycle. It is\na mantra I try to follow to this day, and\nyet, over the years and particularly since\nentering the adult world, it increasingly\nfeels as though this is just an ideal. Even\nto me, convenience often trumps the environmentally friendly option, despite\nmy best efforts to reduce my consump-tion, reuse what I have,\nand recycle as much of\nmy waste as possible.\nRecycling can feel particularly futile when one thinks\nabout all the non-recy-clable materials we\nproduce. Biodegradable and compostable\nplastics, most of which\nare still in development\nphases, are examples of\nthis \u2013 if you ever want to recycle them, make sure they are a\nrecyclable type of plastic. The recycling symbol can be misleading.\nThe Mobius loop icon, on its own, indicates that a material is recyclable. But,\nif there is a number inside the loop, the\ncategory of material it refers to might not\nactually be recyclable. Only glass, paper,\naluminium, and category 1 and 2 plastics\nare typically recyclable anywhere. The\nGreen Dot symbol can be misconstrued\nas meaning \u2018recyclable\u2019, but is actually a\nsymbol only for producer responsibility,\nshowing that a payment has been made\ntowards a national packaging recovery\norganisation.\nSorting and collection methods are\nalso confusing and require varying degrees of consumer responsibility. Depending on where you live, you might be\nasked to sort your recyclables into categories at home or just to separate them\nfrom general waste. Film plastics usually\nneed to be taken to a supermarket collection point or directly to recycling centres\nthat are able to process them. Further\nbarriers to effective recycling include unwashed waste and use of the wrong bin\nbags. From working in a caf\u00e9, I can say for\ncertain that their huge amounts of waste\nare not separated, and that recycling bags\nare often used for general waste.\nThere is significant variation in the\ncollection and processing of recyclables\nbetween countries and even between\ndifferent constituencies. However, even\nin regions with high rates of recycling\ncollection, much of it still isn\u2019t processed\nintonewmaterial.Recycledwastedoesn\u2019t\nnecessarily always make it to a recycling\nplant, and even if it does, the plant might\nnot be equipped to process every kind of\nrecyclable waste collected. Lots of collected recyclables are also shipped overseas\nand processed in another country (or\njust dumped in their landfills), incurring\nadditional greenhouse gas emissions on\nthe journey.\nThe problem of recycling is exacerbated by the excess of materials used, driven by our consumerist society, and production rates are unlikely to decrease in\nthe near future. It isn\u2019t just commercial\nproducts themselves, but the\np a c k a g i n g fortheseproducts,which\nis generally excessive \u2013 particularly given\nthat packaging is a big part of a product\u2019s\nmarketing appeal (think brightly-colour-ed biscuit wrappers or the sleek box of an\niPhone). Packaging is perfunctory, and\nusually disposed of almost immediately.\nAn extra layer of wrapping can ensure a\nproduct is in pristine condition, but are\nwe really willing to trade the beauty of\nour natural environments for this? Our\nhuge demand for production puts strain\non already-struggling recycling process-es.\nReturning to the caf\u00e9 example \u2013 the\nmajority of customers accept a paper bag\nfor their purchases (which are already in\nsmaller bags), often even those who have\nonly bought an item or two and sometimes those who consume their purchase\nin the store. This speaks to apathy and\nthe lack of thought going into many of\nour consumption decisions.\nAnother case that comes to mind is\nthe Natural History Museum\u2019s installation of recycling bins specifically for\ncoffee cups, which clearly indicate separate disposal for cups and lids. A binary\nof two items, in a caf\u00e9 filled with people\nwho have come to learn about the natural world, and still there were complete\ncoffee cups in one side of the bin or the\nother. This could be chalked up to language barriers, even with glaring\nsymbols of the cup and lid, but is\nmost likely simply due to lack\nof care. Of course, it would be\nentirely impractical to employ such niche sorting\nbins on a city-wide level\n\u2013 imagine bins for box-es, bags, forks, knives,\nspoons, cups, and lids at\nfast food chains \u2013 but it is\nevident that there would be\nno place for this anyway in a\nsociety that is going a mile a\nminute.\nThis sounds like a lot of doom\nand gloom, but research continues to\nbecarriedoutintovariousaspectsofthe\nrecycling process \u2013 even into factors influencing behaviour.

Sex workers\ntake on the responsibilities of bishops\nand politicians. A man called Hamm\ngreets his parents Nagg and Nell, who\nlive in dustbins. Two couples who meet\nfor an evening chat end up emotionally\nexposing each other in brutal ways.\nEach of these sentences partially\ndescribe the plots of plays that can be\nput under the heading of \u2018Theatre of\nthe Absurd\u2019. There is a lot to be said for\nthis subversive branch of dramaturgy,\nbeginning with the appealing freedom\nfrom social rules and expectations. Plays\nof this kind often attempt to encourage\naudiences to realise what truly matters\nin their lives and to look at life more\ncandidly. Similarly, existentialism is a\ncommonthemeinAbsurdTheatre:itacts\nas a wake-up call for spectators to take\nresponsibility and to believe in their own\npower to change their situation. Reading\nor watching an example of Absurd\nTheatre can feel like an act of fighting\nback against the meaningless moments\nof life, imposing an angry reaction to\na hostile and unfair world. By doing so,\nthe spectator takes ownership of the\nabsurdity, and the frightening abyss of\npointlessness loses its power over them.\nThere is a slew of examples\nwhere Absurd Theatre pokes fun at\nconversations in polite society and\n\u201cwell-made plays\u201d, suggesting that\nonly by looking frankly at ourselves\ncan we control our lives. To illustrate,\nconsider this line from Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s\nThe Chairs: \u201cI talked and talked, and\nshe kept nodding her head ... She\nagreed with everything I said. I agreed\nwith everything she said. Perfect\nsymphony, perfect understanding. It was\nwonderful!\u201d Full of simplistic language\nand repetition, this line highlights the\nfact that verbal communication is often\ninadequate when it comes to forming\nhuman connections and conveying\nemotions coherently. On the surface, this\nmay seem like a shame, but what Ionesco\nmight really be saying there is that once\nwe become fully aware of this fact we can\nbegin to communicate more effectively.\nHowever, Absurd Theatre is not free\nfrom criticism. Many spectators struggle\nto find a plot in plays of this kind and\nfind the manner of speech obscure and\nridiculous; take the example of \u201cWho\nwatered the wicket in Melbourne?\u201d\nfrom Harold Pinter\u2019s The Birthday Party.\nIt could be said that some audiences\nmay get swept away in this dramatic\nnonsense and delude themselves into\nfinding a deeper meaning in the erratic\nand illogical scenes in front of them\nin order to feel culturally intelligent.\nOften these scenes are so vague and\nopen to interpretation that they could\ncontain countless different messages,\ndemonstrating that the playwright had\nno clear purpose in writing those specific\nwords in that specific order.\nA further disadvantage of Theatre\nof the Absurd is how easily it can cause\na vague feeling of disillusionment.\nCharacters in these kinds of plays are\noften trapped in places by circumstances\nthey do not understand and most plays\ntake a cyclical form, with the characters\nfinding themselves back where they\nstarted by the end of the play. In real life,\npeoplearecapableofdoingextraordinary\nthings to the situations they encounter\nthemselves in, and most people with\na can-do and practical attitude might\nfeel infuriated by the fact that the main\ncharacters in Samuel Beckett\u2019s Endgame\ndo nothing for the whole play except talk\nand wait for some unknown resolution.\nA spectator\u2019s frame of mind and\npersonality will colour their perception\nof all art forms, including theatre. In\nessence, it\u2019s so subjective that all this\narticle can do for you is to lay out the\nnagging suspicions you had in black and\nwhite and help you decide on which side\nyou stand.\nArtsWriter\nSOPHIE R.

Editor\nMohammad glances at a collection of essays\nby central Civil Rights Movement revolutionary Angela Davis. Her essays depict her\nexploration of labour, suffrage, and emanci-pation, and the tenets central to her beliefs.\nI bought my copy of Women, Race, and\nClass in October 2022 from Word on the\nWater, the bookshop on Regents Canal,\nquite ironically, with selected works of\nMichel Foucault.\nWith a title\nas broad as\nWomen, Race\nand Class, I\nwas expecting something similar to\nOrientalism by\nEdward Said, introducing the reader to\nthe idea of intersectionality. What I instead found was a collection of essays\nall linked together by either the themes\nof suffrage, emancipation and race\nrelations, and/or class strug-gle, to which I was much more de-lighted, not only in its intellectual richness but also in the valuable\ninsights each essay had to provide.\nDavis stands as a fantastic essay-ist; what appears as a simplistic clarity on the surface ultimately yields\nprofound and nuanced views. The 13\nessays in the collection maintain a typical structure, arranged in relatively\nchronological order, from life under\nslavery up to contemporaneous issues\nlike the obsolescence of housework. It\nspans topics such as the issue of Black\nfemininity, the use of women\u2019s clubs in\norganising civil movements, and the\nintersection of class and race in America\u2019s suffrage movement. It mandates a\nfair bit of knowledge about notions like\nchattel slavery and about American history up to the 1960s and the Civil Rights\nMovement. These are not mere historical\naccounts, but Davis applies a Marxist and\nfeminist lens onto the shifting dynamics\nof what it means to be Black, female, and\nworking class in\nAmerica.\nScan for a\nlittle surprise!\nI\nn 50 pages, Parker dazzles us through\nthe lives of three unhappy people.\nThree lives who drown their sorrows\nin spirits, and who choose smiles as their\ntears. Three lives that are perfectly fine.\nNothing less should be expected of\na woman who suggested \u201cexcuse my\ndust\u201d as an epitaph upon her death \u2013 as\nin this little book lies a stunning triad\nof short stories about three individuals\nliving, or actually, dying within the Jazz\nAge of 1920s America. The titular short\nstory, The Custard Heart, introduces us to\na common theme that runs through all\nthese three stories: the suppression of\nemotions.\nWe meet Mrs Lanier, someone acutely described by Parker as \u2018wistful\u2019. In the\nconstant carousel of young men, glitter,\nand alcohol surrounding Mrs Lanier, we\nsee the era the character is placed in \u2013 but\nit feels like we are with her in a figurative\nsubmarine; the sound of mundane chat-ter, of music and of dance dampened by\nthe water consuming her.\nFor it is here where we meet depres-sion, the loudest and quietest character\nthat sits in this collection. While depression manifests in Mrs Lanier as her \u2018wistfulness\u2019, it takes fuller possession of the\ncollection in the second story, as the closest companion of character Hazel Morse.\nCompared to Morse, Mrs Lanier opts to run from depression \u2013\nremoving each person, or item that may\nremind her of its existence, be it the wrinkles of aging or even taking herself away\nfrom the gaze of a homeless man. Morse,\non the other hand, chooses depression\nas a drinking partner. Parker uses Hazel\nto depict the extent of the harms of undiagnosed depression. And so here follows a suppression of identity beneath\nlayers of makeup and litres of\nalcohol, that would turn\nHazel into another\ngirl, a \u2018good sport\u2019,\na girl who smiled\nand laughed and\nwas loved by men. The question persists:\nhow many shots would it take before\nher depression would go away? Because,\nfor Morse, alcohol was in the answer: to\ndrink to \u2018be swell\u2019, and to drink \u2018to cheer\nup\u2019. It reaches a crescendo when we see\nalcohol become a destroyer and\nsaviour in the ultimate story of\nthe collection \u2013 You Were Perfectly Fine.\nWhile the themes that\nrun throughout the collection are heavy, Parker weaves\nthem in through witty remarks\nand statements, behind which\nthe reader can almost visualise\nher rolling her eyes as she puts\npen to paper. Her talent in subtlety\nlends the book its magnificence, as the\nreader feels the its focus on depression\nslyly creep under the surface, similar to\nhow it might feel to one with this com-panion. It seems Parker enjoys humour\nas a form of escapism \u2013 and here she cannot escape a tendency to capture a trou-blesodeepinamannersolight.Beautiful\nwriting, with pacing that feels like the\nblur of an evening under the influence,\nmakes this an astounding collection.\nBook Club\u2019s\nOctober Pick:\nThe Custard Heart\nby Dorothy\nParker\nMelancholy in a time of jazz\nBOOKS\nBooksWriter\nKATIA ZYKOVA\nWomen,\nRace &\nClass\nBooksEditor\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nAngela Davis.

His 2022 single\n\u201cEvergreen\u201d left the internet reeling in\nanguish, so the lack of fanfare (at least in\nmy online circle) in response to his well-loved debut album seemed a bit unusual.\nPerhaps that is for the better. Omar Apollo digs deeper and paints an intimate picture of his personal affairs in this EP that\naren\u2019t for the faint of heart.\nEven the album art, a portrait of a\nnaked Apollo, reclining with his hand\nheld over his heart seems to allude to\nthe soul-baring nature of the songs on\nthis project. Don\u2019t let the warm, sunny\nhues of the cover fool you - there are no\nfuzzy, lovesick tracks here (aside from\n\u201cPilot\u201d). With only four songs just shy of\n16 minutes altogether, each one touches\non a different shade of inner blue. Apollo\nkeeps it short and bittersweet.\nIf \u201cEvergreen\u201d is an aching plea from\nan unrequited lover, then Apollo\u2019s latest\nsong is more of a ripened, hushed sad-ness. The opening track \u201cIce Slippin\u201d\nportrays Apollo wandering in his own\nthoughts during a lonely winter drive\nafter coming out to his family. His lyrics\nappraise the wounds inflicted by what\nseems to be his family\u2019s words, alternating in a dialogue between the apologetic party, sung in gentle manner, and the\nbrusque delivery of his own response,\noccupying a lower range with a thinly\nveiled edge of pain disguised in a-melod-ic nonchalance. The fa\u00e7ade crumbles as\nhe sings \u201cinstead, you broke me down,\u201d\n- a vulnerable admission to his own des-olation. Between self-loathing, regret,\nand questions of \u201cwhat if?\u201d, Apollo pens\nan emotional song that explores the concepts of home, belonging, and ache that\ncomes with confronting the truth of his\nown identity.\nThe title track \u201cLive For Me\u201d initially\nopens with lush pads and melancholic\npiano chords to introduce the recurring\nbacking vocal motif that weaves in and\nout of the song. The refrain is earnest as\nhe expresses his devotion to a person in\nthe lines \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t carry\nso you don\u2019t have to\u201d. Charming, zingy\nsynths bring a marginally brighter mood\nto the bridge before the song dissolves\naway the same way it first entered.\nThe third song \u201cAngel\u201d features a bed\nof heavy distortion that gradually builds\nover the track between bouts of tender\nguitar strums that is eventually traded\nfor punchier, electric interludes. Apollo\u2019s\nvoice blurs and bends as he unpacks his\ngrief in the layered vocals, his composure\nheard wavering towards the heart of the\nsong in the upper parts. The EP draws to\na close with the track \u201cPilot\u201d produced\nwith the help of Choker, a genre-bending\nrapperandsingerwhosesonictrademark\nis evident in the contrasting elements of\na sporadic, drilling drum beat, aggressive vocal effects, and meandering melodies of this track. Apollo expertly swims\nacross several vocal styles throughout\nthe song, a testament to his artistic versatility as he concludes another heartfelt,\nintrospective project with lyrical gems.\nThis I will have to unpack upon further\nlistening.\nOmar Apollo\nruns the gamut\nof heavy\nemotions in less\nthan 16 minutes.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0017\u0018\u0016\u0015\u001b\n\u0014\u0013\u0012\u001b\u0011\u0010\u000f\u000e\u001b \u0018\u001c\u001b\n\u000e\u0012\u001b\u0010\u0015\u001b\u0015 \u0018\u001c \u001b\n\b \u001b\u001e\u0010\u0007 \u0006\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001c\u0017\u0016\u0018\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001e\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u001a\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001b\u001a\u0015\u0014\u001e\u0013\u0013\u001e\u0012\u0011\u001a\u0010\u000f\u000e\u001a\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\u0017\u001c\u000e\u001a\u001b\u001c\u0013\u001c\u0016\u0011\u001c \u001a\u001e \u001a \u001a\u0018 \u001e\b\u001c\u001b\u000e\u001a\u0007\u0006\u0007\u0005\u0004\u001a\u0003\u001e\u001b\u001e \u001a\u0002\u0016 \u0001\b\u001c\u001b\u0001\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | COmment 27 October 2023\nrance\u2019, describing the tendency to refuse\ninformation if one\u2019s impact is minimal\nin the grand scheme, which violate the\nprinciple of deliberation: a crucial problem in our current democracy. The modern voter is happy to be manipulated by\nsuperficial influences. For example, on\nthe world wide web. This is why many\ntend to vote for populists with anti-cli-mate agendas \u2013 They cannot be bothered\nto make a fact-based decision. They feel\ntheir vote doesn\u2019t count. Thus we consult\nthe Athenians for their solution: The decision by lot, used to randomly select the\npeople running administrative tasks.\nIn our case, the decision by lot can be\nused to form smaller peer assemblies of\nabout 300 people. This system can be\ninclusive and representative while also\nmaintaining the principle of delibera-tion, thanks to more influence per vote.\nThe assembly would find ways to transition to carbon neutrality and execute\nthem in collaboration with the mayor\nand their staff, as well as experts in the\nfield. After two to four years, new people\ncan be selected for the assembly.\nSome would argue this will just give\nanti-climate voters more influence. However, as I pointed out earlier, the reason\nwhy anti-climate voters exist is due to\nlack of deliberation in their decision\nmaking. This system provokes a feeling\nof responsibility which will lead to informed decision making \u2014 people will\nrealise that fighting climate change is in\ntheir best interests and initiate measures\nto fight it. Peer assemblies will also maintain the support of the people. Even compared to the idea of having a totalitarian\ngovernment that makes perfect decisions\nto fight climate change, peer assemblies\nwill prove more successful since any totalitarian regime would likely to end in a\nrevolution.\nMoreover, feeling responsible to make\ndeliberate decisions encourages the dialogue across the social divide, stops\nradicalisation, and brings society back\ntogether. This is vital not only to the survival of democracy but also to start a new\ngolden age of democracy while saving\nthe planet.\nI\nn recent years, the number of international students has\nshot up. This has been sold by the College as a strength of\nthe university, claiming that bringing people from around\nthe world together will lead to a more effective exchange of\nviews. However, without the possibility of communication,\ndiversity is meaningless.\nAll English speakers at the College, whether from here or\nabroad, have experienced the sinking feeling that comes after\ninitiating conversation with another student and realising\nthat instead of an academic register, the conversation will be\ncarried out in the manner of \u201cBrit abroad\u201d \u2013 talking slowly\nand loudly in the hope that meaning is eventually conveyed.\nGroup-work is glacial, as sentences are repeated or simplified,\nmaking what should be free-flowing discussion feel more\nlike wading through a swamp. Socialising is, in many cases,\nout of the question. The language gulf is too wide for good\nintentions along to bridge.\nOn the part of the international students, the stress of\nfollowing native speakers\u2019 conversation, when your language\nskills are poor, is immense. The chance to speak one\u2019s native\nlanguage, a great relief after struggling through the lectures,\nleads one to associate mainly with other speakers\u2019 of their\nown language.

Compare that to us\n[Imperial College Union]: we have four bars\nin total.\u201d\nImperial students have also complained\nthat other student unions in London charge\nless for their alcohol. Yeung says this is\nbecause they are part of the National Union\nof Students (NUS), a collective of student\nunions which purchases items in bulk,\nreducing their costs per unit.\nI point out that Imperial used to be part\nof the NUS \u2013 in fact, Imperial College Union\n(ICU) was a founding member in 1922. It left\nin 1923, and has since then rejoined and left\nthree times. Its most recent departure was\nin 2008.\nWhy has it not rejoined since then?\nSimply because none of ICU\u2019s OTs have reexamined the case for membership, sats\nStephanie.\n\u201cGenerally, we\u2019ve been doing fine on\nour own since then,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot something that\u2019s out of the question\n\u2013 if students want to see that happen, we\ncan make it happen. It\u2019s just something\nthat\u2019s been swooped off the radar, because\nnobody\u2019s really thought about it in years.\u201d\nYeung\u2019s own plan to decrease prices at\nICU\u2019s venues is linked to her ambition to\nmake the Union a more inclusive place\nfor students. She tells me she will listen to\nstudent proposals at her event forums, and\nplan new events to cater to their interests.\n\u201cI would very much love for them to see\nthe Union as a space they can use,\u201d she says.\nShe hopes that an increase in footfall will\ndrive higher revenues, which she will use to\nsubsidise food and drink.\nThe job title\nOf the five OTs, Yeung\u2019s job title is the\nmost confusingly named. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most\nrepresentative name for the things I do,\u201d she\nsays. She says that the Union\u2019s Activities and\nVenues teams carry out much of the day-to-day operational work.\n\u201cI\u2019m only elected for a year, so I can\u2019t\nprovide continuity the way our staff can.

For\nme, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, what about we do this to\npush my goal,\u2019 and then I\u2019ll work with them\non implementing it.\u201d\nShe says she does help the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies) with some\noperational work, such as administering\nsociety finances and approving activities.\nThe final part of her portfolio is\nsustainability. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not covered in my\ntitle, it is part of my job,\u201d she says. Yeung \u2013\nlike the other OTs this year \u2013 is passionate\nabout sustainability, and the Union has\npublished a new policy that requires clubs\nand societies to ensure that their third-party\nrelationshipsareconsistentwiththeUnion\u2019s\nown sustainability goals. She implores\nstudents to attend her monthly forums on\nsustainability so that their views are heard.\n(To read more on Yeung\u2019s sustainability\ngoals, read her interview in Issue 1828.)\nSustainability\nLike this year\u2019s Union President Camille\nBoutrolle, Yeung believes that ICU needs\nto better represent parts of its student\ncommunity. Yeung highlights postgraduate\nstudents. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to admit\nwe haven\u2019t done our best to represent our\npostgraduate community here. 50% of our\npopulation is postgraduate students.\u201d\n\u201cI want them to be included and\nrepresented within the Union. Our\ncommunity is more than our undergraduate\nstudents.\u201d She says the Union is reviewing\nthe results of a report it authored with\nthe Graduate School on the postgraduate\nexperience, and will soon make changes to\nits provision so that it can better serve them.\nYeung says that passion for the DPFS role\nis the most important requirement for those\nthinking of running next year. \u201cIdeally they\nshould have a little bit of background, but\njust because you\u2019re not experienced in all\nthe areas that the DPFS job covers, doesn\u2019t\nmean you shouldn\u2019t consider running.\u201d\nShe puts forward herself as an example \u2013\na teetotaller who \u201ccame into the job with\nminimal knowledge of how a bar runs.\u201d\n\u201cAnything you don\u2019t know about, there\nare people to support you within the Union.\u201d\n\u201cSo far, all of us OTs are still driven to\nachieve the goals we set out to do.

The conference was organised by Climate-U, a group\nof 16 universities aiming to improve climate literacy and make more sustainable\ncampuses worldwide.\nWalking into the conference room in\nSenate House, I was welcomed by poignant artwork depicting the state of our\nplanet. I also noticed interesting posters\ndescribing some of Climate-U\u2019s \u2018participatory action research\u2019 projects, which\nconnected universities and their local\ncommunities to create tailored climate\neducation and adaptation programs.\nAt the conference opening, I was honoured to present a self-composed song\nof my perspective as a student activist at\nImperial. This piece complemented an\nempowering speech by Professor Jane\nHolder from UCL about the potential of\nuniversities \u2013 including student activists\n\u2013 to make \u201cvital, radical, and inspirational\u201d change on the climate front. He also\nintroduced the concept of \u2018education for\nsustainable development\u2019 where universities encourage sustainable teaching,\noperations, and partnerships.\nThen came the keynote speech by Dr\nFatima Denton from the United Nations\nUniversity. The speech explained how\nthe climate narrative is written by the\nGlobal North \u2013 which imposes unre-alistic, insensitive demands on the\nGlobal South despite its disproportionate contributions to the climate crisis.\nClimate finance was a major part of the\nspeech. Dr Denton highlighted how little funding the Global South receives\nto transition away from the economic model that made the Global North\nprosperous, and questioned the extent\nto which neoliberal economics could\ncombat the climate crisis. Dr Denton\nconcluded her presentation with the\nimportance of universities in delivering climate justice \u2013 including celebrating indigenous knowledge on climate\nchange and challenging the Westernised lens through which research is con-ducted.\nWhile academics from the first session were all from the UK, my next session drew on expertise from the Global\nSouth. Called \u2018Climate action and ecologies of knowledge\u2019, the session described\n\u2018participatory action research\u2019 programs\nin Kenya, Tanzania, India, and Brazil. The\nKenyan speaker indicated that local communities have unique beliefs about land,\nsociety, and nature; thus, conservation\nsolutions centred around these beliefs\nare more likely to be implemented. For\nexample, I learnt how researchers helped\ncommunities in Tanzania restore corals\nand mangroves using local knowledge\nand resources. An Indian academic then\nspoke about developing a postgraduate\ncourse on climate science, justice, and\nrisk, through which students can relate\nto the climate crisis no matter their academic or socioeconomic background.\nFinally, I learnt how Brazilian researchers\nworked with school students to promote\nother sources of income besides deforestation in their village and spread environmental awareness in the community.\nThis session was followed by an entirely vegetarian and vegan lunch. I have\nrarely seen this in the UK, but it is what\nthe Plant-Based Universities (PBU) campaign group aims to normalise. In my\nfinal breakout session, I heard from a\nPBU representative about how they believe universities should stop serving\nanimal-based products like meat, dairy,\nand eggs due to their higher greenhouse\ngas emissions and reliance on natural re-sources.\nBy the time of the closing plenary, I\nwas overwhelmed by the intersections\nbetween food, justice, education, ecolo-gy, and the climate. However, academics\nfrom Fiji, South Africa, the UK, and Brazil summarised everything very clearly.\nThey all believed the key to combatting\nthe climate crisis in higher education is\ncollaboration \u2013 between natural and social sciences, academics and the public,\nactivists and policymakers, and the Global North and South. The panel agreed\nthat power hierarchies and sources of\nknowledge need to be challenged to develop inclusive climate solutions, with\nuniversities being the best place to do so.\nStudent activists are challenging universities globally to do more for our planet\n\u2026 but how many universities will accept\nthe challenge?\nENVIRONMENT\nClimate-U\nConference:\nreflections\nEnvironmentEditor\nSIMRAN PATEL\nPosters and artwork at the Climate-U conference.

In joining forces, they\nhave merged their expertise in\nRNA biochemistry and immu-nology.\nThe pair collaborated to investigate how mRNA, the genetic\nstrands that carry protein-mak-ing instructions encoded by\nDNA, could be manipulated and\ndelivered to human cells in a stable form.\nThey demonstrated that it was\npossible to prevent an inflammatory response by the immune\nsystem to lab-made mRNA by\nmaking specific chemical modifications to the component bases of the molecules. This breakthrough enabled the delivery of\nmRNA into human cells to make\nviral proteins, such as the spike\nmolecule found on SARS-CoV-2.\nThe Nobel Prize committee\nin Stockholm said: \u201cThe laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest\nthreats to human health in modern times.\u201d\nTraditional vaccines typically\nintroduce a weakened or inacti-vated form of a pathogen (virus\nor bacteria) into the body which\nstimulates an immune response.\nThis prepares the immune system to recognise and combat the\npathogen if it were to enter the\nbody.\nBy contrast, mRNA vaccines\ncontain genetic instructions\nwhich prompt our cells to produce lots of viral proteins, which\nthe immune system identifies as\nforeign. This prepares the immune system to combat the virus\nmore effectively in the instance\nof any future infections.\nEarly prototypes of these lab-made mRNA strands posed a\nsubstantial challenge to vaccine\ndevelopment due to their tendency to induce strong inflammatory reactions, rendering\nthem unsuitable for medical ap-plications.\nMedical innovation\nIn 2005, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman\ndiscovered that by replacing one\nof the mRNA bases, uridine, with\na modified version found naturally in cells called pseudou-ridine, they could significantly\ndiminish the inflammatory response triggered by immune\ncells.\nOver subsequent years, they\ncontinued their research and\ndiscovered that using pseudou-ridine in the mRNA not only\nreduced inflammation, but also\nboosted protein production in\ncells that absorbed this modified mRNA. This constituted a\nsignificant breakthrough in the\nadvancement of mRNA vaccines,\nand was crucial in the development of the Moderna and Pfizer\nvaccines.\nAccording to Airfinity, a UKbased health analytics company,\nover 5.5 billion doses of mRNA\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide since the\nonset of the pandemic.\nUltimately, this technology\nenables companies to create a\nvaccine for almost any target if\nthey possess the correct genetic\ninstructions.\nOne of the most promising\naspects of this technology is the\npossibility that it could be used\nto train patients\u2019 bodies to fight\ntheir own cancers. Researchers\ncould examine a patient\u2019s tu-mour, identify cancer-specific\nproteins that are not present in\nhealthy tissues, and create a vaccine that targets these proteins.\nSoumya Swaminathan, who\nserved as chief scientist at the\nWorld Health Organization until\n2022 and now chairs a foundation in Chennai, states, \u201cThe Nobel Prize today recognizes decades of painstaking research and\na belief that mRNA technology\nwould have useful applications\none day. The success of mRNA\nvaccines against COVID has now\nopened up a whole research\nenterprise with potential therapeutics and vaccines for both\ncommunicable and noncommu-nicable diseases.\u201d\nPioneers in mRNA\nvaccines win Nobel\nScienceWriter\nFARHANA ISMAEEL\nScientists who developed the\ntechnology that led to the\nmRNA COVID vaccines have\nwon the Nobel Prize.\nCOVID-19 mRNA vaccine vial.

Her\nface lights up while talking about the\ncontraption that synchronizes the clocks\nin the Union Building (Yeung recently\ngraduated with an engineering degree),\nand she does a full 360\u00b0 spin in her swivel\nchair as she considers her answer to a\nquestion.\nHer joviality belies a serious interest in\nher role - and in the student experience \u2013\none that becomes apparent as we speak.\n\u201cI grew up in Hong Kong,\u201d she says,\nas we settle down for the first of two\ninterviews. \u201cI was raised there for 18\nyears, and then I came to London to study\nat Imperial.\u201d\nSocieties played a big part in Yeung\u2019s\ntime at Imperial. She says she joined\nSkate Society first, describing it as a \u201cvery\ncool time of my life\u201d, where she \u201cmet very\ncool people\u201d, but she is \u201cdone living life\non wheels for now.\u201d\n\u201cI thought my 13 years of ice-skating\nexperience would translate well into\nroller skating. It did not. I kept falling\non my knees and have been traumatised\nsince.\u201d\nYeung says one of her favourite\nexperiences at Imperial was Mahjong\nSociety. \u201cAfter COVID hit, I personally\nbrought it back to life, which was quite\nfun. It was on the brink of death, and\nas far as I\u2019m aware, it\u2019s doing great now.\nMembers keep coming, and tonight, I\u2019m\ngoing to their first regular social this\nyear.\u201d\nBesides her societal experience,\nshe has chaired the Union\u2019s Ethics &\nEnvironment Network, and, in her final\nyear, acted as Recreation Management\nGroupChair.Theserolesbroughtherinto\ncontact with Niamh McAuley and Sam\nLee, the previous two Deputy Presidents\nfor Finance and Services (DPFS).\n\u201cWorking with Sam, and later Niamh,\ndrew me into the role, because I saw it\ncombined the two things I enjoyed while\ndoing my undergrad: the sustainability\nside and the clubs and societies.\u201d\n\u201cOn top of that, the Union services are\nsomething else under my role, which I\npreviously had not engaged with much.\nInitially, I thought that might be a\nweakness, but there\u2019s a reason I haven\u2019t\nengaged with our services \u2013 it\u2019s a gap I\u2019d\nlike to tackle.\u201d\nYeung suggests that the reason she\nhasn\u2019t engaged with the Union\u2019s services\nis because she doesn\u2019t drink. \u201cA lot of\nour events which are drinking heavy \u2013 or\ndrinking oriented \u2013 do not interest me.\u201d\nOne of her manifesto goals this year\nis to deliver a wider range of events\n\u2013 including some not based around\nalcohol.\n\u201cCreating that space for myself and\nother students who\u2019d like to avoid\ndrinking-oriented events is important,\u201d\nshe says, taking a sip from a fizzy\nblackcurrant drink \u2013 her favourite at\nFiveSixEight.\nStephanie says that there are nonalcoholic drinks available at Union\nvenues. But she says that the Union\nis printing new menus for its bars to\nadvertise them more prominently, and\nhas also introduced more non-alcoholic\nbeers to its selection. In the longer term,\nshe wants to increase the quality of nonalcoholic drinks served at Union bars.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m keen on is introducing\nis more wellbeing-related events,\u201d she\nsays, when I ask what new non-alcoholic\nevents she is planning to hold. \u201cI want\nthe Union to be a social environment for\nstudents to come and relax \u2013 no pressure\nto do anything \u2013 just be here and relax,\nbecause university is stressful.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am quite open to ideas, and I\nhave an events forum planned \u2013 because\nwhat I want to put on might not be what\nstudents want.\u201d\n\u201cI would be interested to see what\nsocieties want to offer and whether\nwe can collaborate. I think a lot of our\nsocieties are filling the gap when it\ncomes to non-drinking events, because\nthey have something they\u2019re very good\nat, and I\u2019d like to offer that experience to\nall our students.\u201d\nFood and drink prices\nThe next time we meet, I ask Yeung\nabout the increase in food and drink\nprices at Union venues over the past year.\nStudents have been vocal in expressing\ntheir frustrations, venting on social\nmedia and in conversations on campus.\n\u201cThemainreasonforthepriceincrease\nis inflation,\u201d says Yeung. \u201cInflation on the\nsuppliers\u2019 end means we have to increase\nthe price on our customer\u2019s end as well.\nWe have no choice. But we have been\ndoing our best to minimise costs where\nwe can.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re breaking even at our venues,\u201d\nshe says when I ask why the Union hasn\u2019t\nabsorb any of the price increases. \u201cWe\nhaven\u2019tbeenpocketinganyextramoney.\u201d\nBut, she says, \u201cWe are putting out a\nnew tender for our alcohol supply in\nNovember, with the aim that whoever\nwins the tender will provide us with\na better deal that would allow us to\npotentially reduce costs from January\nonwards.\u201d\nStudents have observed that the\nEastside Bar \u2013 a College bar located in\nPrince\u2019s Gardens \u2013 serves cheaper alcohol\nthan the Union\u2019s venues.

Co-hosted\nby Imperial\u00b4s and LSE\u00b4s Hindu Societies,\nit took place on the 15th\nof October in the\nGreat Hall, on the second floor of the\nSherfield Building. The eye-catching colours of the lehengas, the spiralling flow\nof the dances and the trembling feeling\nof the music synthesised a night worth\nremembering \u2013 the night of the Garba\nDance.\nThe history of Garba, a form of Indian dance, is a long one. Originally from\nthe north-western state of Gujarat, India,\nit describes a night of dancing open to\nnewcomers and large crowds. Garba is\nperformed during Navratri, a long and\nsizeable dance festival dedicated to the\ndivine figure of Durga, the Hindu Goddess symbolising strength, protection,\nmotherhood, as well as destruction and\nwar. Such dedication to a strong powerful\nfemale figure is interlaced in the dance\nin many ways. \u2018Garba\u2019 from the Sanskrit\n\u2018garbha\u2019 means womb and is traditionally\nperformed by women moving in a circle\naround a light.\nThe first dance of the night consisted of concentric circles moving counter\nclockwise around a table holding an icon\nof the goddess Durga and a bowl of fruit.\nThe cyclical movement symbolises the\nchange in the world induced by humans,\nwhile the female form of God - the statue\nin the middle - remains unchanged. All\nguests either wore socks, indoor shoes or\nwent barefoot, to signify respect for the\nearth which we walk on.\nI arrived promptly at 7pm in an improvised lehenga and a dupatta, and was\nkindly greeted by the President, Rishi. I\ndropped off my coat, bag and shoes behind the stage and proceeded into the\nmain hall, where the committee members were dressed in traditional cloth-ing. The men wore a kurta, a loose col-larless shirt with cotton pants perfect\nfor dancing. The women wore a lehenga,\na two-piece ankle-length dress with a\nmatching short or long-sleeved top, and\na dupatta, a fine scarf draped over the\nImperial x LSE Garba Night got us twirling,\nwhirling, and swirling in youthful exuberance\nSOCIETIES\nSocietiesEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nFelix attended the Hindu Society\u00b4s Garba Night to enjoy an evening of\ndancing, music, and chai.\nThe event was a lot of fun.

The room quietened,\nas a short man waddled onto the podium,\nhis face hidden under the shade of his\nlarge ginger afro and baseball cap, with\na conspicuous-looking \u2018moustache\u2019,\nslowly peeling off his front lip as his left\neyebrow stained the frames of his round\neyepiece.\nParles Chonzi, associate research-technology consultant at the biotech\nfirm Feranos, in a thick Moldovan accent,\nassured the audience of his discovery.\n\u201cLK-100 improves upon the Lee\u2019s attempt\nby adding maguffium. That one tiny\ndrop changed everything\u201d, he said,\nenunciating each syllable methodically,\nreading off what seemed to be his right\npalm. \u201cWe are happy to say that the paper\nhas been published in Elsivere\u201d.\nCameras flashed \u2013 which Chonzi asked\nto halt immediately, owing to his epilepsy\n\u2013 as people rushed to the microphone to\nask questions.\n\u201cHow can we trust that your\nsuperconductor is not a failure like the\nothers?\u201d Trillbee Burdock, from the Daily\nMail, asked. With a twitching frown,\nChonzi vacantly stared at his altar for 14\nseconds, before mumbling something\ninto his microphone. When asked for\nclarification, Chonzi cited his epilepsy\nagain and urged the next journalist to\ncome to the stage.\nThe conference was a roaring success,\nwith publications rushing out their\narticles, though each seemed to have\ndifferent quotes of Chonzi. Mernie\nBaydoff, the editor in physical scenes\nfor Cell said: \u201cThis is an incredibly\nexciting discovery. Much with Watson\nand Crick\u2019s discovery of DNA\u2019s structure,\nsuch manuscripts need not pass the peer-review process on the pure excitement\nand inherent truth of the claim being\nmade.\u201d\nChonzi asked the reporters in the room\nto send him their email addresses, so\nthat he could each send them a \u201cspecial\nscoop that they\u2019d love\u201d. The moment the\nconference finished, he was seen rushing\noff the stage and opening his Trading212\napp on his phone, though no cameras\ncaught which stock he was looking at.

The\nperformance of this song really stood\nout, partly due to multi-instrumentalist\nJasper Llewellyn\u2019s emotionally-charged\nand seemingly sporadic loud attacks on\nthe snare drum. This cut through the radiant texture with such urgency and pre-cision, conjuring a sound reminiscent of\nthe contemporary classical works of David Lang; in particular the drawn-out textures in his piece \u2018Child: II. Stick Figure\u2019.\nTheir performance debuted hitherto\nunreleased pieces, which the band ex-pressed, is always a \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d\nexperience. Despite this humble admis-sion, their devoted fanbase received the\nnew sounds with great awe and amaze-ment; particularly, the novel addition of\nthe bass clarinet, accordion, and elec-tronically-processed vocals to the already\ngrowing array of instrumental hues.\nWhat was audibly striking, was the substitution of the bass guitar with the bass\nclarinet in some of the new songs, which\ncould be seen as a way of enhancing\nthe bass register. It was able to provide\nthe ensemble with a more opulent and\nblending sound with its ability to sneak\na strident low note in the stretched out\nsingle-unit textures in the music.\nIn terms of their stage layout, the band\nhad opted for a semi-circle shape, making use of the whole length of the stage.\nPost-concert, the violinist and vocalist,\nOliver Hamilton, explained that this new\nlayout with the violins facing each other rather than being in their usual close\nproximity was something they had never\ndone before. The effect of having a mirror image violin proved particularly effective at the point when the two violins\nperformed a heated virtuosic duet!\nI am excited to see what the band\ncomes up with next, especially with this\nnew direction, which seems to involve\nelectronically-manipulated vocals sung\nby Magdalena McLean, reminiscent of\nCaroline Polacheck\u2019s heavily stylised\nsinging or Georgia Ellery\u2019s extensively\nprocessed vocal manipulations in her\nLondon-based duo with Taylor Skye and\nJockstrap. Keep your eyes and ears peeled\nfor new single releases and concert performances from this relatively new and\nexciting eight-piece band caroline!\nLondon post-rock folk band, caroline, amazes with an unfamiliar setlist\nduring a live performance at King\u2019s Place.\nLondon band caroline\nhints at new tunes\nMusicWriter\nDENIZ DORTOK\nMUSIC\nThe semi-circle set-up of the band at King\u2019s Place.

When the\nlow emission zone expanded in London, officials instated cameras to read licence plates, to which perpetrators\nargued that the government had infringed on their free-dom. Political parties saw this as an opportunity to win\nsuch perpetrators over by removing climate change policies from their programs.\nAnother problem inherent in our governments is that\npeople do not feel heard by their representatives. Feeling abandoned by the government, they lean towards\npopulists \u2014 Not because they necessarily believe in the\npopulists\u2019 agenda, but as a form of protest against the\ngovernment by voting parties that stand diametrically\nopposite to the current government\u2019s ways. Populists\nusually do not have carbon neutrality as their highest\npriority issue, hindering the implementation of necessary measures. The threat to our democratic system\nposed by the social divide between \u2018left-liberals\u2019 and\n\u2018right-conservatives\u2019 is equally concerning, where neither side is listening to the other, destroying any chance\nto reach a consensus.\nSo, what type of governmental reform does the fight\nagainst climate change require?\nTo achieve a reasonable solution, we need to combine several individual measures. The overarching plan\nto lead us into a carbon neutral future was named the\n\u2018Third Industrial Revolution\u2019 by economic and social\ntheorist Jeremy Rifkin, referring to the introduction of\nrenewables as energy sources, electric vehicles for mobility and the internet for communication. Rifkin points\nout that industrial revolutions introduce new means of\nproduction, travel, communication, and energy gener-ation, which then determine the structure of their administration bodies or governments. For example, coal\nand oil are processed in few central places and distributed from there.\nThe centralised energy generation with a clear ranking between producers at the top and customers at the\nbottom, and a complex supply chains as intermediaries\nwas supervised most effectively by centralised governments with hierarchical structures, as popularised since\nthe Second Industrial Revolution.\nHowever, renewable energy is different. While there\nare centralised wind or solar parks, people can also produce their own energy at home, and can therefore be\nindependent. Hence, the grid will change accordingly,\ntreating everyone as both providers and users, not just\ncustomers.\nThe question is, what new government system can\nwe adopt that has less centralised power and intermediary hierarchies? We can find the answer from 500BC\nAthens with their implemented direct democracy. People made legislative decisions themselves as opposed to\ntoday\u2019s representative democracy. A direct democratic\napproach solves the problematic blockade of political agendas benefiting from social divides, which will\nencourage dialogues across the divide. Yet, there are\nseveral problems posed by replacing our representative democracy with a direct one \u2013 there was a reason\nwhy James Madison, the fourth President of the United\nStates, avoided the term \u2018democracy\u2019 to describe the US,\npreferring to call it a republic. The threat posed by the\ndictatorship of the majority, vulnerable to the volatile\npassions of the mob, made direct democracies too risky\nin his eyes.\nHowever, another problem with direct democracies,\nas pointed out by James S. Fishkin in his book When\nthe People Speak, stems from the democratic dilemma amongst participation, deliberation and equality.\nAnthony Downs introduced the idea of \u2018rational igno-How saving\nthe planet and\ndemocracy go\ntogether\nCOMMENT\nHow we got to this point and where\nwe can go from here.\nCommentWriter\nCONSTANTIN KRONBICHLER\nThere have been increased attempts by governments to limit carbon emissions. Wikimedia Commons\nThere is widespread\nresistance against the\nmeasures introduced\nby officials.\n\u201c\n\n"
