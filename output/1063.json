    "content": "14 NOTICES AND OPINION FELIX FRIDAY 4TH OCTOBER\nsimon baker\nWell hello there. You can't keep a good man down, and sure enough,\nFelix lost some of its best staff last\nyear, so you're stuck with me. Ah,\nthe modesty. Ah, be bugger ed. No\nsooner had I graduated than I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard a voice telling me that early release\nhad been revoked, sentencing me to\nthree more years. Of course to a larger number of you this means nothing.\nNot a reflection on my prose, but\nbecause many of you have just\narrived at Imperial fresh out of\nschool.\nThe prospect of embarking on a degree course should not daunt you,\nand to help matters, Uncle Simon\nwill offer you the benefit of his experience. Firstly, don't let the size of\nthe place worry you. As a result of a project solely for your benefit,\nImperial now has so many signs that\neven Mark Thatcher could not lose\nhis way. Secondly, always talk to\nyour fellow students, occasionally\ntalk to computers. With computing\nstudents, form your own opinions.\nFinally, since you will find yourself on a fairly tight budget, it's very\nimportant to shop around for groceries and suchlike. Southside Shop\nmay not be quite the cheapest in the\narea. In fact, I always found a little\ncorner shop down the road could beat\nthem on price. It's on Brompton\nRoad near Knightsbridge tube. Loads\nof green and gold. You can't miss it.\n(You think I'm joking!)\nIn the world beyond South Ken,\nwe are in the middle of the party conference season. Currently Labour are\ndoing their stuff, wooing the voters\nwith their policies on... Ah, we've\ngot a problem. Tony Blair has shown\nthat the way to achieve huge popularity is to slag off the opposition and\nnot commit yourself on anything, a bit like when you crash your car.\nUnfortunately, somebody somewhere before the next election is\ngoing to want to know what the hell\nNew Labour is and what it plans to\ndo. Empty phrases on taxation, social\nsecurity and constitutional reform\nwill not persuade any floating voters to back the party and highlight the\nleadership's mortal fear of offending\nanyone south of Watford Gap. Time\nwill tell how durable that smile is\nwhen the real picture emerges.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION HAS THE FOLLOWING\nVACANCIES ON THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE\nCOUNCIL\nWELFARE OFFICER\nWOMEN'S OFFICER\nTRANSPORT OFFICER\nThese posts will be elected at the first full Council Meeting of the year, at\n18:00 on Tuesday 15th October in the Union Dining Hall (opposite the Union\nOffice), the nominations having closed at 18:00 on this day. All full members\nof the Union are entitled to vote. For more information about these posts, see\nthe President in the Union Office.\nEight Ordinary Members will be elected to Council at this meeting. Two\nof these must be first years and two postgraduates, any full members of the\nUnion may stand\nHUMANITIES\nEVENING LANGUAGE CLASSES The Humanities Programme is once\nagain offering an exciting programme of evening classes beginning in October. As last year, classes for all College students and staff\nare available at elementary, intermediate and advanced levels in\nFrench, German, Italian, Spanish,\nand Japanese; and at elementary\nand intermediate levels in Russian\nand Mandarin Chinese.

Registration and English test\nat the beginning of the second week\nof term.\nPROGRAMME CONSTABLE DEBUSSY MARX Three exciting new courses are on\noffer this Autumn as part of the\nHumanities programme. Be one of\nthe first to enroll.\nMusic: Mr Roderick Swanston,\nthe well known broadcaster from the\nRoyal College of Music, will examine how ideas influenced some significant musical works in the nineteenth century, and how a knowledge of this can add to the understanding of both of the individual\npieces of music and the development\nof nineteenth century cultural his to ry.

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 4TH OCTOBER\nNews in Brief\nEvelyn Gardens\nsummer assault\nSummer ac como dati on guests in\nEvelyn Gardens nearly initiated an\ninternational incident when they tangled with a French IC student staying\nin Hall. The circumstances around\nthe incident are not clear, though an\nassault on a minor is believed to have\noccured.\nThe guests, dancers in the annual\nRoyal Tournament at Earls Court,\nhad been staying in the Halls for a week before Police were called in to\ninvestigate allegations of an assault\non a young girl. The girl claimed that\nshe was struck by the student whilst\nshe was using the telephone.\nWhen interviewed by the Police,\nthe student stated a number of complaints against the dance troupe,\nmany of which were backed up by\nother residents in the Halls. Local\nresidents too had been writing to the\nCollege complain g of late night football matches, loud discos, property\nbeing covered with eggs and flour\nand general rowdiness. Students\ncomplained of food being stolen\nfrom fridges, loud parties and general rudeness from the guests.\nThis particular incident started just\nafter midnight on the Friday when\nthe student was awoken by the girl\nusing the phone. He asked her to\nkeep it down, but received some verbal abuse in return to which to student responded by striking the girl.\nHowever, later that night, adult\nmembers of the dance group threatened the student and assaulted him in\nretaliation. Again the Police were\ncalled, but did not take any action at\nthat time.\nAs the Police were involved, the\nCollege stepped in to discipline the\nstudent. Upon consultation wi fh IC\nSecurity and the Police, he escaped\nwith a strongly worded warning.\nNEW SOLUTIONS\nREFORMED\nThe pressure group New Solutions,\nthe brain-child of ex-ULU President\nGhassan Karrian, has been reformed\nto fight the introduction of top-up\nfees in British Universities. The\ngroup originally convened to fight\nthe NUS policy for returning student\ngrants to 1979 levels.\nICU THE ONLY BAR WITH\nGUINNESS?\nImperial College Union could be the\nonly students' union in the country to\nhave Guinness on tap in their bar\nafter the NUS buying group, NUS\nServices, failed to reach an agreement with Guinness pic. ICU is unaffiliated to the NUS, and thus unaffected by the move.\nStout drinkers in other universities\nand colleges are being advised to\nswitched to Murphy's. ROLLERBLADE-FREE\nCAMPUS Ken Weir, Head of Security, has\nadvised staff and students not allow\nroller blader s into College buildings.\nThe campus has been a popular site\nfor in-line skaters to attempt jumps\nand b lading down steps. However,\nthere have a been a few incidents of\npeople being hurt in collisions with\nblader s. Mr Weir added that\nRollerblading is not allowed anywhere on campus, and students travelling to College by blades are asked\nto remove them before entering\nbuildings.\nOn a related note, Mr Weir called\nfor extra vigilance from those with\nmotorcycles, as there has been a great deal of damage to motor bikes\nover the summer. He suggests that\nanybody seeing any damage on their\nbike should report it immediately to\nsecurity.\nMONDE X GO AHEAD FOR\nEXETER\nThe University of Exeter has become\nthe first in Britain to introduce the\nMondex system of smart-card money\ntransfers and identity cards.\nThe scheme, backed by Nat West\nwill give students just one card for\nUnion membership, li bary facilities,\naccess, voting, use in the campus\nshops and can even be used as a phone card. The cards have been\nintroduced with support from all sectors of Exeter's Uni-vers it y community. Sir Geoffrey Holland, ViceChancellor of Exeter University, said\nthat he was \"intrigued by the possibilities of the Mondex cash less purse.\" Charlie Offer, Communications Officer of Exeter's Guild of\nStudents stated \"We welcome the\nnew Mondex card and anticipate its\nsuccess. It is a welcome development\nfor students.\"\nAs an incentive for students at\nExeter, Nat West has charged each\ncard with \u00a32 credit, and the bank\nhopes to expand the scheme to other\nUniversities. Imperial College has\nstudied the Mondex system but in the\nwords of Estates Director Ian\nCaldwell \"we want to learn from\nExeter's experience.\"\nCLAMPDOWN ON COMPUTER MISUSE\nFollowing a year full of computer\nproblems and computer misuse, students are being advised not to abuse\nthe priv i ledges that they enjoy with\nthe College's computer network. The\nhandbook issued by the Centre for\nComputer Services has the full list of\nconditions and regulations regarding\ncomputer use.\nIn a warning issued by the\nCollege, students would face severe\ndisciplinary proceedings if the facilities were misused. The warning goes\non to state several examples where\nstudents, of both post-graduate and\nundergraduate level have been\nexpelled from College for computer\nmisuse involving racial and sexual\nabuse.\nHALDANE LIBRARY\nAUTUMN COLLECTION\nThe Haldane Librarian, Janet Smith,\nhas invited students to come and\ninvestigate the Haldane Library's Autumn collection of humanities and\nmusic material. The Haldane\nCollection occupies the same building as the main library. It has a wide\nrange of fiction and audio materials\nas well as periodicals and daily\nnewspapers.\nEach term, the collection is\nexpanded; recent additions to the\nrange include CDs and musical\nscores. There is also a programme of\ncultural events in store, which will be\npublicised in Felix.\nEviction for travellers\ncamping at Harlington\nIn a summer devi od of much in ci dent, Imperial College's sports\nground at Harlington saw more\nthan its fair share of drama.\nAugust saw an invasion of the\nsports ground by a group of thirty\ntraveller car vans. The southern\nportion of the ground, where the\ntravellers camped, is currently\nundergoing preparations for gravel extraction.\nThe southern half of the site,\njust off the M4 motorway near .\nHeathrow, has not been in use for .\na year while survey for the a gg rep gate extraction was un de tak ni. Fearing for the saftey of College\nstaff, on-site contractors and the\ntravellers themselves, the College\nundertook to have the travellers\nremoved from the site.\nBy August 7th, a court order under\nthe High Court Rules Act was\nobtained to evict the group. A few\ndays later bailiffs, supported by\nPolice, moved the travellers on. To\nprotect the northern half of the site,\nwhich contains the clubhouse and\ngroundsman's residence, a security\nMap of the site showing the sports\nground. The travellers accessed\nthe southern half of the ground via\na public footpath to the west. All\nentrances to field have now been\nblocked.\nfirm has been contracted to patrol the\npitches and grounds with both men\nand dogs.\n\n"

You will have hopefully\npicked up the new Felix supple-ment, Something for the Weekend,\nwhich should come out each week\nalongside Felix. Don't forget to\npick it up. It will contain all the\nlistings and reviews and features\nthat used to appear in Felix. Hope\nyou like it.\nIt has been a summer full of\nupheavals, both in the local environment around the campus and\nin wider terms concerning student\nand Higher Education funding.\nThere is enough building work\ngoing on around SW7 to save Ove\nArup from bankruptcy. Everyone\nis getting Millennium fever. I just\nhope that everything will be finished in time.\nWhich brings me to dBs, the\nUnion's new venue. It looks great,\na massive improvement. The\nrefurbishment involved a lot of\nstructural work, which was very\nnearly late and certainly had a wider effect than perhaps was\nintended. I shall say nothing other\nthan \"thank-you\" to the college\nelectric an s who restored power to\nour collating machine in the nick of\ntime.\nMoving from the physical to the\nfiscal, education funding is yet\nagain in the news. The CVCP's decision to try and make up their\nfunding shortfall from students is\nfraught with dangers, and could be\ninterpreted by the more cynical as\na shot across the bows of the\nGovernment.\nOne would hope that students\nwouldn't be caught between the\nuniversities and the Treasury in a battle over funding. Students have\ntheir own, admittedly related,\nproblems with money and are\nincreasingly suffering from financial difficulties.\nIf the massive turn-out at the\nUnion's recent training day for\npart-time staff is anything to go by,\nthen for students, there are indeed\ngrim days ahead.\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nCareers planning advice\nDear Fresher,\nWelcome to Imperial College.

How?\nJoin clubs and societies, attend\nmeetings, take up a new sport,\ndevelop a new interest - any of\nthese are likely to bring you into\ncontact with like minded students.\nHow about earning some good\nmoney in the long vacation? It's well worthwhile doing some preliminary job hunting between\nChristmas and Easter. Call in at\nthe IC Careers Service (Room 310,\nSherfield Building) where you will\nfind information about Vacation\nTraining, write to employers with\nyour CV, call in to some local\nshops and hotels and see who's advertising in the local press.\nVac jobs give you experience in\njob hunting, letter writing and\ninterviews, as well as a real insight\ninto what it's like to work for a particular type of employer.

Pop in and speak to\nthe information staff. Find out\nabout \"PROSPECT (HE)\" - our\ncomputer careers guidance system\n- and all the information booklets\nand reference files. Have a look at\nsome of the videos, attend some\nseminars on careers, get yourself\nsorted out.\nThe Milkround is in the spring\nterm of your final year. This is\nwhen employers visit campuses to\ninterview applicants or invite you\nto their London Offices\nChristmas vacation courses are\na popular way of finding out about\ncareers such as marketing but only\na few major recruiters run them\nand they are normally over-sub-scribe d many times.\nYou may be thinking \"Stop! I'm only a fresher - why are you telling\nme all this?\"\nI'm telling you because you need\nto start planning your life now,\ndon't just drift through College\nand merge with a degree and\nnothing else.

To win, the crew\nhad to beat two national lightweight\neights - Germany and Holland, (the\nGerman team went on to take gold at\nthe World Championships in\nStrathclyde, Scotland). The Saturday\nrace against the Germans was more\nnerve w racking for the crew, as crew\nmember Martin Kettle explained:\n\"We've been nervous all week, but\nwe got it right off the start and used\nour extra weight really well. We had\na crew push at the barrier (the first\ndistance marker on the course) and\ntook another length.\"\nBy the finish IC and QT had three\nand a half lengths. In the final the\ncrew had the same the same explosive start and slipped quickly away\nfrom the Dutch, opening up clear\nwater and making their point by\nreturning the fastest time of the regatta at the finish. The crew contained\nIC students Richard Dunn, Pete\nWilson, Simon Dennis, Louis Attrill,\nLuka Grubor, with Jim Goodwin at\nthe helm. This unit was backed up by\nthe experience of QT members\nSimon Wall, Martin Kettle and\nDavid Gillard.\nThis crew's Henley win was\nMartin MacElroy's second win as\ncoach in as many years. Charing\nCross Medic Simon Wall summed\nup MacElroy's contribution: \"There\nwas a lot of strength and experience\nin the crew, but Martin focused the\npower. The Grand was his dream,\nand he made it a reality.\"\nThe Grand eight were joined by\nthree other IC/QT crews on finals\nPHOTO: JOHN SHORE\nThe victorious team with their trophies. IC beat a number of international sides on their way to the title, but were pipped\nby an American team in the seperate Temple Challenge Cup.\nday - the most entries of any club.\nThe Wyfold cup was won by\nQueen's Tower, who came from\nbehind to beat a polished Molesey\nCrew by three quarters of a length.\nThe agony of the defeat was too\nmuch for the Molesey bowman who\nfell out of the boar at the end of the\nrace, completely exhausted.\nThe Temple Challenge Cup, for\ncollege and university eights, had its\nentry requirements toughened this\nyear, in an attempt to prevent\nImperial College and Oxford\nBrookes teams from dominating the\nevent. However, the IC crew overcame stiff opposition from the\nUniversity of London's freshman\ncrew, who had already been selected\namidst controversy as the Great\nBritain representatives for the Under\n23 World Championships. By the\ntime the crews had finished, the\nselectors may have been pondering\nthe wisdom of their earlier judgement - the IC crew beat UL by three\nquarters of a length to take them into\nthe final.\nThe final of the Temple was\nagainst an undefeated Yale\nUniversity USA freshmen crew.\nYale had looked strong all week\nfrom off the start and once more led\nfrom the beginning, never letting IC\nback into the race despite a determined last charge along the enclosures. The morning showdown\nagainst UL had clearly taken its toll.\nHowever, many of the young crew\nwill be back this year, and will build\nand capital is e on their great progress\nlast year.\nThe fourth Imperial College crew\nto race on Sunday, a composite quad\nsculls crew with Leander, were beaten in the semi finals of the Mother\nCup by their counterparts, the\nGerman Under 23 quad.\nIC team win gold\nfor Britain at World\nChampionships\nAt the Under 23 World Championships, held in Belgium a week after\nHenley, an all IC cox less four, containing three winners from the grand\neight, refocussed their efforts under\nthe guidance of Martin MacElroy.\nTheir commitment was rewarded in\na storming finish in their final to\nsnatch the gold medal by 0.04 of a second from Romania.\nThe IC/Leander quad scull missed\nqualification for their final in\nBelgium by less than 1 second, after\na technical glitch with 500m to go.\nThey did however win their B final\nconvincingly, recording a time that\nwould have contested medals in the\nA final.\n\n"

Honorable traditions of free education and well funded universities\nhave withered and died. Students will\nvoice then: discontent at the universities and the universities may call strikes\nto protest against the government. So\nwhere did the trouble start?\nStudents lose out.\nUntil 1994. student grants had been\nfrozen (effectively a drop of 3-5% per\nyear), and the difference was made up\nwith a student loan. However, policy\nchanged and the grant started to tum-ble. This year the two are equal (See\ngraph). Little action has been taken,\npartly because the body supposed to\nrepresent students, the NUS, was in\ndisarray. The NUS insisted that grants\nand benefits be restored to 1979 levels\n- a demand impossible for the government to fulfill.\nUniversities lose out.\nThe money handed out to universi-a i though increasing, was not sufficient to cover rising student numbers.\nLast year Imperial College effectively\nhad it's entire budget cut by 0.7%.\nWorse still, the funding body HigherEducation Rinding Council for\nEngland warned that the grant would be\nfrozen in 1998. However,few people were\nprepared for the drastic action the government was to take in the November bud-get.\nGovernment go too far?\nKenneth Clarke revealed in his 1995\nbudget that capital funding (ie. funding for\nbuildings and resources) would be cut by\n31% for 1996 and 63% by 199S. This\nrepresents a loss of \u00a32 million for Imperial\nCollege alone! \u00a3500 less funding for every\nstudent.\nThe missing money had been transferred to junior and secondary schools,\nand the education minister claimed that\nthe shortfall could be made up from private investment. For many universities.\nUniversity heads take action.\nThe council of Vice Chancellors and\nPrinciples (CVCP) met to decide what\naction to take. The funding shortfall had\nto be made up from somewhere, or standards could not be rna in tai ned. so they\ndecided to threaten the government with\nthe introduction of top-up fees. These are\ncharges charged directly to the student by\ntheir college. This plan ended any hope of\ncontinued free education.\nAs expected, the Cabinet was swift to\nDay\nrespond, voicing strong opposition to top-up fees. What they advised instead was to\nreduce student intake - the exact opposite\nof the policy so far. The Conservative\nparty, who had been 'committed' tc\nincreasing student population, reversed\ntheir decision when just 30% of the target\nThey also reminded universities that\nthey would be fined if their intake\nchopped below the agreed minimum.\nUnimpressed with the inaction of the\nNUS, many university union presidents\ncollaborated to form a pressure group\nknown as the Aldwych Group. They sent\nformal complaints to the CVCP and\nattempted to organise a national day of\nStudent Loans Company kicked\nThe SLC had been a real black eye for\nthe government - allegations of corr up tion, poor management and bad debt\nrepayment were big problems - even\nthough just 40% of eligible student took\nout their loan.

These could prove\ndevastating to the students - around \u00a31000\nmake a significant difference: money that\ncould not be afforded by students.

The\nconcrete and steel section, measuring\n5 by 6 meters and weighing an estimated 4 tons, missed a workman and\na female student leaving the library\n\"by literally three inches\" according\nto one eyewitness. \"It would definitely have killed anyone underneath\nit.\" said another.\nWithin a few minutes, site managers from both IC Estates and Schal\nProject management had arrived at\nthe scene, and hastily organised a team of workmen to remove the shattered ribbon-lathe construction.\nEfforts to bring in further equipment,\nand to isolate the scene of the in ci dent, were hampered by the arrival of\nseveral dozen onlookers.\nEventually seven men were\ntogether able to roll the huge roof\nsection up into a cylinder, ready for\nits subsequent removal.\nMr Ian Gillet, a College safety rep-resent at ive, was one of the few site\nmanagers present willing to speak to\nFelix. Speaking under strain soon\nafter the incident, he admitted \"I have no explanation at this time.\nClearly there will be a full invest iga tion... I have notified the Health and\nSafety directorate, and Ian Caldwell\nis on his way.\" Mr Gillet went on to\nconfirm that to the best of his knowledge no-one had been injured, but\nnervously joked that someone had\n\"felt a draught down the back of his\nneck as it fell.\"\nAt the time of going to press, security officials had established a wide\ncordon around the site of the collapse\nand a mini-digger was being\nemployed to clear away the debris.\nThe reason for the collapse is\nunclear, and is likely to remain so\nuntil the completion of the site engi-ne ers' investigations. If the ceiling\nwas not being worked on directly at\nthe time of the accident, then the failure must have been caused by the\nalterations being carried out elsewhere in the building, namely the\naddition of two extra floors on the\ntop of the library. It is also unclear\nwhy students were permitted to walk\nbeneath the ceiling if it was unsafe.\nThis is the first major accident\nsince the beginning of construction\nworks on the library extension and\nthe BMS building. Occurring as\nearly as it does within IC's proposed\nten-year \"Campus renaissance,\" due\nbe completed in 2007, this incident\nraises serious questions as to whether\nsafety can be maintained when\ncrowded construction projects overlap or face tight schedules.\nThis accident must be considered a lucky escape, not only for those\ninvolved but also for the officials\nadministrating the works.\nDon't forget to pick Ents Lounge transformed\nThe Union Building summer refurbishment came to conclusion this\nweek with the opening of the new\nentertainments lounge, dBs. The\n\u00a30.1M project was just completed in\ntime, despite last minute finishing\nand system testing on Friday morn-ing.\nThe previous incarnation of the\nlounge, a dull and dingy room painted dark blue, had been on the\nUnion's 'must-do' list for some time.\n\"It was like a Sixth Form Disco,\"\ncommented ICU's Events and\nMarketing Manager, Mark Home. \"It\nwas a real dump. We had problems\nwith bands not being able to fit all\ntheir equipment in, and the vis i bil ty was appalling.\" The new look venue,\nrenamed 'dBs', received high praise\nfrom returning students, most\nremarking that it was a significant\nimprovement.\nPlans for the refurbishment were\ndrawn up by the Union in lias on with\nMary Marsh and Alan Spehnjak\nfrom the College CAD Office. The\nnew disco set up got the thumbs up\nfrom passers by, but one commented\n:\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN\nthat the room was \"a bit primary\" in\nits decor.\nFunding for the work was taken\nfrom the Union's Strategic\nDevelopment Reserve, a pool of\nmoney set aside from profits made\nby the Union's bars and the\nBookstore. This is the first such project to use the reserve since it was set\nup two years ago.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 4TH OCTOBER SPORT 15\nClimate gets the better of hockey team in Barbados( But win, lose or draw, there's always the beach bar)\nIt was a dark and stormy night in the\ndeepest depths of the Union Bar.\nThere was an atmosphere of sobriety.\nSuddenly, a spark turned to a full\nblown dream - the Barbados tour was\nborn in all of its splendour and glory.\nFor once, the teams' acted on their\ndrunken ideas and after several\nmonths of hard work and headaches\nby 'Cantona' and a select few others,\nwe headed off to Heathrow on our\nway to Barbados.\nBy some miracle we arrived in\nBridgetown airport on time after a few rounds of Tager, lager, lager' on\nthe plane. Suddenly we were hit with\nwhat turned into somewhat of a problem - the heat. The raw and delicate\nmaidens and gentlemen of the British\nIsles were not used to the soaring\ntemperatures and wide skies of their\nnew location. A certain amount of\ngetting used to the environment was\nrequired. A little bit of relaxation\nbefore those all important hockey\nand football tournaments.\nExcept that all that seems to be\nThe ladies hockey team getting it together before one of their matches in\nthe Banks Beer International Hockey Festival. Unfortunately for the\nteam, the heat and humidity played havoc with their training schedule.\nInternational Hockey Festival.\nOur first week was spent acc lim at ising. We struggled with sight see ing, sunbathing and adjusting social-ly. The thought of playing sport in\nthe heat was frightening so we avoid-ii lil it The mens football team posing before the scoreboard of the Kensington\nOval. Co-incidentally, the board shows the team's aggregate score over\ntheir tour, but they got a good result against the Aston ladies.\nremembered is sun, sea, sand... oh\nand a few aches and bruises from the\nhockey, football and beer which is\nafter all what we were there for. Of\ncourse, we represented Great Britain\nalong with four other British\nUniversities and had it not been so\nhot, humid and hungover, we could\nhave done well at the Banks Beer\ned physical activity as best we could.\nAlthough the foot ie lads did manage\na bit of play away from home with\nour British counterparts (foot ie lads 0\n- Aston girls 5)\nThere were many nations represented in the Banks Hockey festival,\nand though most of the teams were\nfrom the various Caribbean islands,\nthere were at least fifteen European\nsides and other American and South\nAmerican teams. The atmosphere\nwas ecstatic. Well there aren't many\nteams that have been privileged to\nplay at the legendary Kensington\nOval (even if they weren't playing\ncricket).\nThe opening ceremony was\nvibrant and colourful (mainly due to\nthe sunburn) as it turned out to be the\nbeginning of a spectacular sporting\nfest for the Hockey teams. Jane and\nSmita represented Imperial College\nin the Festival Eleven in the\nBarbados International side, and several of the squad did their bit for the\nFestival by umpiring throughout the\nTournament. It wasn't quite the\nOlympics, but we performed on par\nwith the British side at Atlanta\n(minus Steve Redgrave and Matthew\nPinsent).\nWith no Hillary Rose or Susan\nMason in sight, the balls kept ending\nup in the back of our net, and without\nCalum Giles the twenty four year old\nsuper sub from Havant, we only\nscored on rare occasion. We did,\nhowever become the most popular\nteam in the festival because throughout the losses, we kept the smiling\nfaces and the fighting spirit going.\nThe foot ie lads had arranged several friendly fixtures vs Barbados\nsides and like the hockey, were not as\nsuccessful as they would have hoped.\nUnfortunately amidst the heat and\ndehydration, during the last fifteen\nminutes, the oppositions forwards\nfrequently passed the previously rock\nsolid defence (on more than one\noccasion).\nAll in all, the score line did not\nrepresent the enthusiasm, commitment and sex appeal of the teams.\nWe worked hard and played harder\nbut unfortunately, the heat and\nhumidity got the better of all of us.\nThe tour was enjoyed by all as was\nthe island. We saw and appreciated\nas much as was possible in two\nweeks.\nWe would like to thank all those\nwho supported the tour and would\nlike to say that with your continued\nsupport, teams will be able to represent the College and Union with\ngreater success in the future.\nSpecial thanks to: Peter Mee, Chris\nOakley, Liz and Linda from PR,\nSimon Goodall. Lorraine in registry,\nTimmy T., Jane Hoyle and all of the\nstaff in the Union.\nThe team would also like to say a big Cheers to Rachael for being a star\nand organising everything.\nAn ex hasted pair prop each other\nup after a particularly tiring\nmatch\n\n"
