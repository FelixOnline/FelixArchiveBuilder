    "content": "M2 CAVING CLUB\nCaving Club are one of the\nCollege's most active clubs. In the\nlast two years major caves in Peru\nand France have been explored. In\nthis article Harry Lock describes\nsome of the clubs activities.\nExploring the many\nsubterranean passages,\nchambers and shafts that\nexist in limestone areas has\nmany attractions; this short\narticle explains some of\nthese, and describes the\nactivities of the college\nCaving Club.\nThe main attraction is the\nunique nature of the cave\nenvironment with the\nchance to see spectacular\nformations on all scales,\nfrom fragile straw-like\nfew people are ever likely\nto go. Until one has been\ncaving several times, it is\nhard to describe adequately\nthe various inner feelings of\nexcitement, exhilaration,\nexhaustion, apprehension,\nand achievement that may\nconfront the cave r before,\nduring or after a trip.\n'The cave is not a lifeless\nplace, it is a living thing to\nwhich we have to give\nourselves; a thing that can\nbe gentle and also be a stalactites crowded on the\nroof of a chamber, to large\nstalagmite bosses many\nmetres high, rising dome-like off the floor. During a journey underground, the\ncave r may well have to\ncrawl, climb, squeeze, swim\nor just walk through\npassages that may vary in\nheight from 20cm to that of\na small block of flats. The\nmost memorable parts of a cave system are usually the\nvertical shafts which can\nonly be descended by rope\nor ladder, often trying as\nbest as possible to avoid\nthe full force of a spectacular underground\nwaterfall. Always there is\nthe knowledge that you are\nexploring parts of the\nunderground world where\neither no person has been\nbefore, or where relatively\nsavage whose changes in\ntemper can render it\ndangerous. And the harder\nit treats us, the happier we\nare to master it and make it\nours'.\nFor many, one attraction\nis that caving is, without\ndoubt, a strenuous sport,\nrequiring fitness and\nstamina. As in other sport,\nphysical performance can\nbe improved by increasing\nthe frequency of caving s, and by other activities,\nsuch as running,\nswimming, and climbing.\nYour own commitment to\nthe sport will decide what\nfitness level you aim for.\nThough the British caving\nscene is at present\nundoubtedly male\ndominated, this is not to\nsay that opportunities for\nwomen are limited\u2014indeed\nwhat they may lack in brute\nstrength, they generally\ngain in a naturally higher\npower to weight ratio,\nwhich leads to fitter, agile,\nand ultimately safer way of\ncaving.\nThere is a considerable\namount of satisfaction to\nbe gained from the safe\nand effective use of the\nvarious items of\nhardware\u2014Karabiners,\ndescend eur s, prussi ks and\nropes, and it is really up to\nthe individual how much\ninterest is taken in\ntechniques and equipment,\nproviding the caving\nmethods actually used are\nquiet safe. The club has a modern outlook in the\nequipment and techniques\narea\u2014all new members are\nintroduced to single rope\ntechniques (SRTL) in the\nfirst term of their joining,\nand once a year a2 day\ncourse at the National Cave\nTraining Centre is held for\nall interested people.\nNevertheless the traditional\nmethods of ladder and line,\nwhen used, are also\npractised as safely as\npossible. Equipment is also,\nunfortunately, the major\nexpense incurred by both\nnew and estalished\nmembers. Although we can\nlend wetsuits, over suits and\nspecialist hardware for the\nfirst few trips, a keen\nnovice wil usually want to\nstart to buy a set of\npersonal gear, simply for\nreasons of comfort and\nconvenience.\nThe standard of club\ncaving has improved\ndramatically over the last 2\nyears and, with a recent\nhighly successful\nexpedition to Peru, and 3\nconsecutive summer tours\nto the French Alps, there is\na core of committed and\n.experienced cavers willing\nto train and take\nunderground any keen new\nmembers.\nA typical club weekend\ndeparts from London on\nFriday evening, and arrives\nin the caving area later that\nnight. We stay in local\ncaving club huts, which\nprovide bunk bed accommodation, cooking\nand washing facilities, and\noften have hot showers\nupon return from the cave.\nCaving trips are organised\non the Saturday and\nSunday, usually visiting the\nlocal pub on the Saturday\nnight, when there is a chance to relax and discuss\nthe days caving over a few\npints. Return to London is\nmade on the Sunday night.\nThis year, the emphasis on\ncaving in the Yorkshire\nDales has been increased,\nbut not to the exclusion of\nseveral trips to South\nWales, Mendips, and\nDerbyshire. The main\nhighlights of the year are\nthe Easter and Summer\nTours. This year the club\nhopes to visit Ireland at\nEaster, and a number of\nideas for the summer are\nunder consideration at\npresent purely social events\nare the Christmas and\nAnnual Dinner in Yorkshire.\nThe annual Dinner is held\non the May Bank Holiday,\nwhen the election for\nCommittee posts is held\nand the drinking and\ngames last well into the\nnight.\nIf you think you might be\ninterested in going caving,\nthe club has its weekly\nmeetings on Wednesdays\nat 1pm in the Union Lower\nLounge, when plans for the\nforthcoming caving trip are\nfinalised. We look forward\nto seeing you.\n10 Friday 18 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Bars Boycott Success\nDear Hugh,\nlr, the light of the bars\nboycott and your interview\nwith Rob Northey in last\nweek's FELIX, I would like\nto set the record straight\non a few points.\nAs far as the boycott is\nconcerned, a number of\nstudents were, during last\nweek, a little concerned\nabout the reasons behind\nit, so here I will try to\nexplain them. Firstly, it\nshould be noted that the\nregular, bar-by-bar,\nmonthly breakdown of the\nBar Trading Account\npresented to the Bar\nCommittee, has not\nappeared since last year,\nthere was an increase by\nsome twenty five per cent\nof the staffing and\nadministration costs. Mr\nNorthey explained half of\nthis as being an\napportioning of\nadministration costs from\nthe Refectories. When\npressed by Carl Burgess\nand me, he refused to give\na breakdown of these\ncosts. Finally, there were\nthe resignations of the\nUnion Bar staff. Having\nworked an eighteen hour\nshift the day and night\nbefore, they were told\nduring Fresher's Fair that\nthey had not run the bar\nvery well, despite near\nrecord takings. With over\neighteen months' more\nexperience of running the\nUnion Bar than Rob\nNorthey, they felt\ncompelled to resign\u2014who\nwouldn't? This left\ninexperienced bar staff\nrunning the Union Bar\nduring the busiest week of\nthe year. After these three\noccurrences, plus other\nlesser issues, the\nsabbaticals and the\nstudents members of the\nBar Committee had lost\nconfidence in the Bars'\nmanagement. This can best\nbe resolved by Union\nControl of the Union Bar,\nbecause that makes the bar\nmanagement answerable to\nmost of the customers.\nThe above is not an\nattack on Rob Northey, but\nrather on his management\nstyle\u2014whether decided by\nhim or otherwise. However,\nI would like to take issue\nwith a couple of his\ncomments in last week's FELIX. He stated:' All the\nimprovements have gone\nthrough the Bar Committee\nand the Bar Committee\nChairman, like all major\npolicy decisions'. Reducing\nthe level of accountability,\noutlined above, was not\ndiscussed. Changing the\nmethod of payment of\ncasual staff, with its\ndetrimental effect on\nservice, first came to me\nfrom one of the casuals. In\naddition, the price of\nreductions he talked about\nwere due to the increases,\nuntil I put a sheet of\ncalculations in front of him\nand told him to reduce the\nprices of Carlsberg,\nForster, XXXX, Strongbow\nand Dry Blackthorn.\nFinally, I would like to\ncome to the boycott itself. I was delighted by the level\nof support that we received\nfrom three areas: the\nstudents who chose not to\ndrink, or at least drank\nelsewhere for a week; John\nFecamp and ASTMS for\ntheir solidarity, and the\nmanagers of the Merrie-go Downe, the Norfolk, and\nthe Queen's Arms\n(Chelsea), for their near\ninstant eo us special offers\non prices, which enabled\nstudents to drink not too\nexpensively elsewhere.\nYours sincerely\nDave Kingston.\nreduced to the several lines\nsubmitted last week.\nCertainly this offer of open\npublic debate does not\noriginate from someone\nwho is 'shamefaced about\nthe matters'.\nSecondly, Mr Newman is\nwrong about the FCS\nposters we displayed at\nFreshers Fair. They do\nportray the feeling of\nConseratives in Consoc\nand Conservatives in\ngeneral. We do believe the\nGreenham Common\nWomen are 'misguided', we\ndo object to the continued\npresence of USSR armed\nforces in Poland and the\nEastern Bloc (as do the\npatriots of those countries)\nand we do believe that\nArthur Scargill is an anti-democrat.\nFinally, I denounce the\nway in which arrogant Mr\nNewman links this society\nwith the removal of CND\nposters. I am glad I did not\nsee your posters Mr\nNewman, they may have\noffended me. Incidently if I knew of the person, or\nCon Soc Defend\nContras\nDear Sir,\nI object strongly to several\nremarks made about the\nConservative Society in last\nweeks letters. The letters to\nwhich I refer were both\nwritten by people whose\nhard left-wing views cannot\nbe said to be either\nobjective or universal.\nTo describe the\nNicaraguan elections of\n1984 as 'democratic', and\none resulting government\nas 'popular' is a blatant\ndistortion of the facts. The\nabsence of 'official'\nconservative observers is\nirrelevant in the light of\nother Western\nobservers\u2014for example\nthose representing USA,\nwho certainly did not\napprove of the sham.\nAlthough I do not\ncondone the violence of the\nContras I would compare\ntheir idealogical struggle\nwith that of the patriots of\nAfghanistan, and several\nEastern Bloc states.\nMr Hobbis unjustly\naccuses us of quibbling on\nthe issue. I offered to\narrange for a Tory speaker\nto defend our stance, with\nunion, at the time, he\nseemed quite happy. I now\ntake it that he has\nconceded this opportunity,\nsince it seems, his own\nargument has been\npeople, who had removed\nthese posters, I would\ninform Mr Burgess, and\nsupport their removal from\nthe Union.\nYours faithfully\nJohn Martin\nChairman IC Con Soc.\nGet Down Roger\nDear Sir,\nWe are very sorry to hear\nthat Second Lt Preece did\nnot enjoy the Life Sciences\nParty, this is primarily a Freshers party, and the\nmain aim was to get people\ntogether so that students\nfrom different departments\ncan get out and meet each\nother. The success of the\nparty rests with the guests\nas well as the organisers.\nWe should like to point\nout that:-1 As a Freshers' event,\nentrance to the party was\nFREE to all students with\nFreshers' week tickets, and\nto Life Sci students.\n2 A bar extension was\napplied for, but one had\nalready been a located the Fresher's fair.\nThe profits made from\nthe Life Sci party are to be\nused to sub sid is e other\nsocial events and parties at\nwhich we hope second Lt\nPreece will be able to 'let\nhis hair down' a little more.\nLSD Ents (1985)\nDamned bounders!\nDear Sir,\nI shall be grateful if you put\nthe following in the\npersonal ads column of the\ncoming issue of FELIX:\n'Whosoever did the act of\ncowardice of throwing a carrier-bag full of water on\nme, on Tuesday the 8th October in the gents toilet\non 7th floor of Mech Eng at\n14.00 should come forward\nand let me know what his\nintentions were.'\nYour sincerely\nDr Ft Benodekar\nResearch Assistant\nMech Eng\nShome Mistak\nDear Editor,\nIn reply to Mr Fernandex's letter of last week, I would\nlike to point out that most\nof the spelling mistakes in\na publication of this sort\nare probably due to people\nsubmitting illegibly written\narticles. This in particular\napplies to commonly\nwritten phrases or words eg\nsignatures.\nI am sure that the staff of\nFELIX can be absolved\nfrom blame for most of the\nmistakes.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Williams\nPhysics 3\nNewman Rant\nDear Hugh,\nMichael Jones' letter, last\nweek, starts off very well. I am grateful for his 'sincere'\npraise of my article 'Mrs\nThatcher, sex, IC and the\nsingle student'.\nHe gives some good\nadvice, repeating what I have said many times\nbefore, that you should\n'consider and analyse very\ncarefully what Michael\nNewman has to say'.\nIndeed you should do this\n'before coming to any\nconclusion' about anyone's views. This was the very\npoint my article made, and\nI would like to thank Mr\nJones for repeating it for\nme.\nSadly Michael Jones fails\nto live up to his own\nadvice. Rather than\ncriticising my arguments\nand points he continues the\ntradition of those who have\nsupported hard-core\npornography at IC, he\nattacks me personally. He\nignores my article, digging\nup something I wrote\nnearly two years ago to\naccuse me of hypocrisy.\nFriday 18 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rent too high?\nLandlord getting you down?\nWarden getting up your nose?\nHere's the answer-No-one can ignore the\nproblems encountered by\nmany young people when\nfaced with finding a place\nto live. For some its asking\ntheir dear old dad to\nguarantee a mortgage,\nother struggle to live\ncomfortably when half of\ntheir student grant is spent\non rent. But for those who\nare unemployed, and\nworse\u2014single, the worries\nare daunting. Will they be\ngiven a council house? Will\nthe DHSS pay all their\nrent? Will they need to take\nhelp from an independent\norganisation like\nSHELTER? For all these\npeople, but particularly the\nthird group, there is a realistic alternative, a way\nout of the embarrassment\nwhich lies on the edge of\nthe law\u2014Squatting.\nAs defined, squatting is\nnot against the law. Once a person is inside a property\nhe is doing nothing\ncriminal. The only way of\nremoving him/her is\nthrough the civil courts, by\napplying for a repossession\norder. This can be a lengthy process, especially\nwhen proceedings are\nbrought by a Labour\ncontrolled council. For\npolitical reasons, they do\nnot condone squatting, but\nthey do make the practice\nrelatively easy. Hence their\nhousing departments can\ntake six months or more to\nclear cases through the\ncourts. This process takes\nfar less time if the property\nis occupied by persons\nother than the squatters, or\nif authorised people are\nabout to more in.\nSo far, everything looks\nfine\u2014a nice home, free of\ncharge or rent for six\nmonths or more. But from\nnow on, the picture gets\nless exciting (or more so if\nyou enjoy living an\nuncertain, dangerous life).\nIf you think squatting is for\nyou, then your first step\nmust be to read about it.\nUnearth any legal\nloopholes you may need,\nand talk to the experts. The\nCitizen's Advice Bureau\ncan be very helpful, and\nwill put you in touch with\nsquatter's organisations in\nyour area. These\norganisations are often run\nby people who have been\nsquatting in the area for\nmany years. They will know\nthe answers to any relevant\nquestions, and will offer\nunequaled advice.\nThe next step is to find a squat. Don't bother looking\nfor one in Kensington or\nBelgravia. Even if you did\nfind an empty building. You\nwill be out of it very soon\n(remember the Hamlet\nGardens fa is co). Your place\nmust be unoccupied and\n'unfit for habitation', a bureaucratic term that\noften means no more than\n'has a broken window' or\n'needs central heating'. It\nmust be council property,\npreferably on a housing\nestate. This will ensure that\nyou are not alone and will\nnot be rated as a special\ncase in court. It must be in\na Labour controlled\nborough. If your intended\nsquat satisfies all of these\nconditions then you can\nlook forward to many\nmonths of Free\nLiving\u2014once you're in.\nbreaking the lock. If the\npolice do come around\nthen they will not believe\nyour story about walking in\nthrough the back door if\nthe front door lock looks as\nif it's been knocked out by\na sledge hammer.\nSo, now you're looked at\nfour places and found one\nin reasonable order. It\nmight need a lick of paint,\nbut the plumbing works\nand it is quite clean. The\nfirst thing to do is put your\nown lock on the door. This\naction proclaims that you\nare in residence, and intend\nto live there. Do not move\nin everything in right away,\nbut spend at least a day\nthere to make sure you\nhave the right place. Then\nmake the place look lived\nin\u2014put up curtains if you\nhave them and put all your\nbelonging in front facing\nrooms. If the windows are\nboarded up, now is the\ntime to take the boards\ndown - as quickly as\npossible. During the first\nweek you must be very\ncareful. Do not let any\nstrangers into the squat,\nand treat anyone who looks\nofficial with confidence.\nYou have made this\nresidence your home and\nno one can force you to\nleave except the courts.\nESTATE A^ BJT\nNo,Ho, 3 AT TEK SEA IS TAR TOO so u f^e our SE, PECKHAM IS FA^ MORE RADICAL, k ANYWAY\nIT'S CfiT HOT WAT E^... Getting into a squat is\nnot a problem. Moving in to\nit is, so it is wise to\ninvestigate a number of\nplaces before you decide\non the right one.\nRemember that unless you\nwalk in through an\nopen/unlocked door, then\nyou are technically\n'breaking and entering', so\nto avoid breaking the law,\nkeep your eyes peeled for\nopen doors. If you wish to\nbreak the law then do it\ndiscreetly. Your future\nneighbours may not object\nto squatters, but they won't take kindly to the sound of\nhammering and splintering\nwood at 4-o clock in the\nmorning. Try to open a window or door without\nFurniture should be e as v to get hold of, other\nresidents often throw out\nitems in reasonable\ncondition. Local street\nmarkets are also a cheap\nsource of second-hand\nuseable beds, chairs, sofas\netc but remember that a squat is not a permanent\nresidence and all contents\nwill need to be moved\nwhen you go, so don't get\nanything un wie d ly unless\nyou can get hold of a van.\nA few words about gas,\nelectricity and telephones.\nIf you're very lucky, these\nwill be connected when\nyou move in but it is rare.\nNever try to connect them\nyourself unless you are\nprepared to be taken to a criminal court for theft. If\nthis is y or chosen course of\naction then make it\npossible to prove that your\nintended to pay for all used\nservices. Deposit suffice nt money, with details of\nmeter readings etc with a bank or better still, a solicitor. The Electricity\nand Gas Boards have a legal obligation to supply\nany household with their\nservices upon request but\nthe law is vague about\nwhether a squat is a household so you might\nfind them awkward.\nAfter some time, the\ncouncil's housing\ndepartment will\nacknowledge that you are\nsquatting and will ask you\nto move out. This is only a request and you should not\ndo so. After more time they\nwill warn you of court\nproceedings. Again, you\nare not legally bound to\nvacate the premises nor\ncan they force you out yet.\nThe next step is a court\nsummons. Ignoring this will\nnot help you, but the\noutcome of the hearing will\nnot be to your advantage\nanyway, so do not go to\ncourt. Finally, you will\nnotified of the courts\nfindings and will be told\nthat the court bali ffs will\nevict you forcibly if you are\nstill in occupation on a certain date. This means\nthat a bunch of 'heavies'\nwill visit you on that date,\nthey will break down the\ndoor if necessary, dump all\nyour belongings on the\nstreet, and ensure that you\ncannot get back in. Now,\nyou have our original\nproblem back\u2014you are\nhomeless. So go out and\nfind another squat!\nFinally, some advice on\nan on imi ty. The only time\nyou must reveal your real\nname is to the police, or\nwhen under oath, so do not\ngive your name to Anyone\nif it can be avoided. The\ncivil court will then refer to\nyou as 'persons unknown'.\nIf you must give a name\n(eg to the Electricity\nBoard), use an alias, this is\nnot an offence!\nSquatting is hard work,\nbut it can be fun\u2014you will\nmeet people from all walks\nof life, and you will learn\nmuch that is normally\nignored or taken for\ngranted. You will also save\nmoney.Don't do it unless\nyou are committed (or\ndesperate) and always keep\nsmiling - it can get\ndepressing. If you can stay\nin the same place for\ntwelve years, the property\nbecomes yours (this is the\nonly 'Squatters right') so\nthere is something to aim\nfor.\nFELIX Friday 18 October 9\n\n"

    "content": "Bones Laid Bare\nDebbie Wilkes looks at a new electric analysis system to\naid the study of childhood bone development.\nDetermination of the\nskeletal maturity of children\nis of great value in\ndiagnosing growth related\ndisorders, and for giving a general indication of\nphysical development. Dr R King and Dr A Kwabwe,\nfrom the Electrical\nEngineering Department,\nare working in conjunction\nwith Professor J Tanner of\nthe Institute of Child Health\nto develop a new fully\nautomated system which\nwill assess skeletal maturity\nwith great accuracy.\nThe most convenient way\nof assessing skeletal\nmaturity involves\nmonitoring the bones of the\nhand and wrist. Each bone\nshows a sequence of\nrecognisable stages along\nit's developmental path,\nand attains a reasonably\nconstant final shape.\nStraightforward\nmeasurements of stature\ncan't be used, because of\nthe natural variation in final\nadult heights attained. At\npresent the assessment is\ncarried out by highly skilled\nphysicians, who analyse\nthe X ray of the child's hand to obtain the value for\nskeletal maturity. This value\ncan then be compared with\nthe normal value for a child\nin their age group. This\nprocess, however, is time\nconsuming, and frequently\nimprecise. When the new\nsystem is completed it will\nprovide an objective\nassessment, with greater\nreproducibility, greater\naccuracy, and which can\nbe obtained by unskilled\nstaff.\nThe new system will take\nthe X ray of the hand and\ndigit is e it to give a2,000 by\n1,000 array of pix cels, having 256 grey levels.\nThen edge detection and\nenhancement technique\nwill be used to identify the\nedges of the bones, so that\nthey can be labelled and\ntheir positions recorded.\nThe system will then\nconcentrate only those\nbones that give the most\naccurate information, in\nHook of ha mate Hamate\nCapitate\nTnquetra\nFigure 1\nFig, 1 these are the bones\nshaded. Each individual\nbone can be classified into\none of eight stages from A to 1, with each stage\nhaving significant features\nwhich are used for\nidentification. The\nknowledge base used for\nthis detailed evaluation is\nbased on a standard\nclassification devised by\nProfessor Tanner, using\nclinical experience. An\nexample of the kind of\nimage that the system uses\nfor class fi cation can be\nseen in Fig 2; which shows\nan edge detected picture of\nFigure 2\na radius and it's mata physics, at stage G of\ndevelopment. Finally, an\noverall maturity assessment\ncan be obtained using a weighted sum of the scores\nfrom each separate bone.\nA major advantage of this\nsystem is that it can\ninterpolate between stages,\nfor instance, it could give a final assessment as 90%\ntowards F and 10% towards\nG, whereas a physician\nwould only state either F or\nG. This is particularly\nimportant if the child is\nsuffering from a hormone\nimbalance, as it gives an\naccurate measure of the\nextent of the problem.\nSo far, the system has\nbeen perfected for the\nradius bone, and the\ntechniques developed can\nnow be applied to the other\nbones. The ultimate aim is\nto produce an automated\nsystem which will take an\nX ray , process it fully, and\nthen produce a value for\nskeletal maturity.\nVisas While You\nWait\nAny Overseas Student\nwhose visa expires on the\n31 October or later, need\nnot travel all the way to\nCroydon this year to have\ntheir visa renewed as the\nHome Office are coming to\nyou.\nAll you need to do for the\npresent is to bring your\npassport into Student\nServices, preferably by\nFriday 18th October but no\nlater than Wednesday 23rd October, and register your\ndetails with Lesley\nGillingham, the Welfare\nAdviser, who in turn will\nregister your details with\nthe Home Office before the\nexpiry date in your\npassport.\nThe Home Office will be\nsending three staff\nmembers to Imperial\nCollege on Monday 25th and Tuesday 26th November to renew visas\non the spot. The whole\nprocess will take 15\nminutes; considerably\nbetter than seven hours in\nCroydon. It also means that\nat no time will you have to\ngive up your passport,\nwhich is a considerable\nimprovement as there is no\npossibility of documents or\nyour passport being mislaid\nor lost in the post.\nThis is the first time the\nHome Office have come to\nImperial with their\nextension scheme. The\nmore students who use the\nA scheme the greater the\nlikelihood of the scheme\nbeing repeated next year,\nand any student who has\nwasted a whole day in\nCroydon will agree that it's a lot more convenient than\nany previous situation.\nRemember, as long as your\ndetails are registered with\nLesley before the expiry\ndate in your passport, you\ncan use the scheme. Check\nyour visa carefully as any\nstudent whose visa has\nalready expired and has not\nalready registered their\nclaim will have to make the\ntrip to Croydon.\nWelfare Adviser on the move\nLesley Gillingham, the\nWelfare Adviser, will be\n'setting up shop' outside\nStudent Services Office\nnow, in the coming weeks.\nShe will be visiting\nCollege Houses or Head\nTenancies on the following\ndates:\nMonday 21st Oct 7-9pm Lexham Gardens, Flat 4,\n79/81\nThursday 25 Oct 7-9pm, Bernard Sunley House, The\nOffice, House 42\nMonday 28 Oct 7-9pm Montpelier Hall, The Office\nBesides being on hand to\ngive advice, Lesley will also\nhave samples of all leaflets\nand information sheets\navailable from Student\nServices.\nFELIX Friday 18 October 5\n\n"

    "content": "No Trouble\nTrouble was avoided at the\nRCS Chemistry Dinner on\nFriday night. A group of\nnon IC students, obviously\nthe worse for drink, tried to\ngate-crash a post-dinner\ndrinking session in the\nBot-Zoo common room.\nThey were turned away\nquietly by a few well built\nmembers of the\nDepartment.\nGeoffrey Reeves, Chief\nSecuirty Officer,\nconsidered this a minor\nincident, but took the\nopportunity to explain\nsome improved security\nmeasures. Since the\nbeginning of term, entry to\nmany Union events has\nbeen under better control.\nMr Reeves said that the\npresence of non students at\nthe party could have been\ndetrimental to the usage of\nthe college's public\nperformance and dancing\nlicense. Union card checks\nare now being enforced\nwhere possible to ensure\nthat only IC students/staff,\nand other members of the\nUniversity of London and\nbona-fide guests are\nallowed into future events.\nMembers of the Association of Scientific, Technical and\nManagerial Staffs (ASTMS) gathered in Prince Consort\nRoad last Tuesday as part of a day of protest over\nUniversity Technicians' pay. The demonstration took the\nform of a motorcade, commenced at midday and took in\nsix other University sites before its conclusion in Russel\nSquare, where General Secretary Clive Jenkins addressed\nhis members. Mr Jenkins, pictured here with fellow\nmembers, has since sent a letter of protest to the\ncommittee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.\nNo Prices\nThe pricing policy for the\nCollege bars is still\nunresolved following\nTuesday's meeting of the\nImperial College\nstudents are welcome to a unique\nalso Brakspears\nSam Smiths \u2022 London Pride \u2022 Courage Directors\nMerrie~Go~Downe\nReal-Ale\nTavern\nOS\nAT THE\nCorner of Ashburn Place and\nCourtfield Road\nBar committee. There was\nsome dispute over the\ninterpretation of the bar\nprices policy as agreed\nbetween ex-ICU Deputy\nPresident Christine Teller\nand former refectory\nmanager Victor Mooney. As\na result the pricing issue\nhas been referred back to\nthe next meeting of the\ncommittee.\nBar price crusader\nGareth Fish presented the\nmeeting with his own price\nlist, which he had\ncalculated on the basis of\nhis understanding of the\nTeller-Mooney agreement.\nCollege Financial Secretary\nBrian Lloyd Davies and\nrefectory manager Rob\nNorthey made it clear that\nthey had a different\ninterpretation of the\nagreement. Mr Northey told\nFELIX that to cut prices to\nthe level recommended by\nMr Fish would be\ndetrimental to a 'solvent\ntrading situation'.\nMr Nothey has appointed\nMr Tony McVey to run the\nUnion Bar for a probationary period. Mr\nMcVey previously worked\nin the refectories, but Mr\nNorthey confirmed that he\nwas suitably experienced in\nbar and cellar management.\nICU President Carl\nBurgess will be discussing\nproposals for the Union Bar\nand Union Building with\ncollege Secretary John\nSmith and Brian Lloyd\nDavies next week.\nNews In\nBr i ef\nNo Kitchens\nResidents of Tizard and\nSelkirk Halls are being\nasked to sign a petition\nobjecting to modifications\nto Southside kitchen\nfacilities.\nThe petition will be\nforwarded to Peter\nHallworth, Managing\nSurveyor of Residences. Mr\nHallworth has suspended\nwork in Selkirk and Tizard\nHalls, whilst he considers\nthe hall Committee's viewpoint.\nIn Falmouth Keogh Halls\nno opposition was voiced\nto staircase kitchens, when\nthe warden, Dr Paul Jowitt,\nheld a hall meeting last\nFriday.\nNo Money\nDuring the University of\nLondon Graduation\nCeremony in the Albert\nHall on Wednesday, Lord\nFlowers, ex-rector (1972-85), attacked the University\nGrants Committee (the\nMajor Source of University\nfunds). He criticised the\nUGC in the presence of\nPrincess Anne for the low\nlevel of University Budgets.\nHe said that 'the UGC 'makes no allowance for\nexcellence in teaching', and\nclaimed that this was due\nto the committee's inability\nto measure teaching\nstar dards. It is interesting to note\nthat his attack follows\nrecent cr tic is m of the same\nteaching standards by\nprominent members of the\nstudent body.\nNo Success\nImperial College were\nknocked out in the final of\nthe UAU Bar Boycott\ncompetition earlier this\nweek. Despite widespread\nsupport for the seven\ndays of abstinence, IC\ncould not fight off the\nchallenge from Brunei\nUniversity who organised\na one-day 'lightening\nboycott' before the start\nof term. Union President\nCarl Burgess said that he\nwas naturally\ndisappointed with the\nresult, but added that he\nwas proud of his team for\ngetting as far as they did.\n4 Friday 18 October FELIX\n\n"

    "content": ">\nWM\nDANCE This year's London Dance\nUmbrella promises to be\nthe most successful since\ntheir first modest festival in\n1978. Some 60 separate\nperforming groups are\ninvolved in an event lasting\nuntil Christmas, spread\naround venues all over\nLondon. The festival started\nlast week with New York's innovative Pick Up\nCompany, choreographed\nby David Gordon.\nThe company's three new\nworks, Nine Lives,\nOffenbach Suite and My\nFolks, all suffered from a diss a pointing lack of\ncoherence. Offenbach Suite\naccompanied by a sadly\nmediocre cello duet,\nconsisted entirely of slow\nand disjointed study\nexercises for which the\ndancers, obliquely\nscattered across the floor,\nexpressed little enthusiasm.\nNine Lives and My Folks\nwere a little more ordered,\n(the latter using some\nexcellent lighting and\ncolour effects with striped\ncloths, designed by Power\nBoothe)and allowed greater\nversatility to the players.\nYet, despite these\nattributes, the mournful\ngravity of the company,\nexpressed not only in their\nmovements, but in their\ncostume and attitude also,\nprovided a dismally\nuninspired peice of dance.\nBOOKS\nMaia. Richard Adams.\nRichard Adams' latest\nexcursion into the realm of\nhuman fiction has either\nproved that he has a greater affinity for animals\nthan people or that his well\nof invention has dried up.\nThe book is full of the type\nof gratuitous\nsex'n 'sensationalism only\nused by bad authors\ndesperate for sales. Having\nsaid that, the slobs among\nyou will probably rush out,\nbuy it and try to discover\nthe juicy bits. Well\u2014you'll\nhave a long search as this\nThe three films reviewed\nthis week probably say\nsomething about the\ncurrent state of the cinema\nindustry. One is a revival,\none is a remake and one is\nutterly risible.\nThe revival is, however, a worthy one. Paul Newman\nis Fast Eddy, The Hustler\na pool whizz-kid who, with\nhis stooge, Jake La Motta,\ntravels around conning\nfellow players in order to\nraise money for the big\nshowdown with Minnesota\nFats.\nunfair to describe Pale\nRider as a remake, but its\nstrong similarities with\nShane and High Plains\nDrifter edo convey a strong\nsense of deja vu.\nIn this western, the evil,\ngreedy bad die, Richard\nDysart, whose techniques\nin diplomacy are as brutal\nas his hydraulic mining\nmethods, is trying to force\na small dedicated\nThe Hustler.\nPale Rider.\nLifeforce.\nFor a modern generation\nbrought up on a diet of\ntelevision designed to\naccomodate the smallest\nattention span, Robert\nRossen's34 year old film is\nprobably a little slow. The\ncarefully controlled pace\nhowever, (the editor is\nDede Allen; she's still\nediting films today - good\nto see some successful\nwomen in the business),\ndoes allow the fine cast\ntime to develop their\ncharacters, and\nper server ance is rewarded,\nif only, for the rapport\nbetween Newman and\nScott.\nIt's probably slightly\nbook is also ridiculously\nlengthy. The characters are\ncardboard st ero types, there\nis prevalent sexism and I imagine that only people\nwho find their current lives\nunrewarding and dull will\ngain satisfaction from\nreading this grandiose\nfantasy.\n(Penguin \u00b04.95)\nTherese. Francois Mauriac.\nIn spite of being somewhat\nlong winded, the\nconception of this book is\nbrilliant. It concerns\nTherese Desqueyroux, (No,\nI can't pro nou ce it either)\nborn into a rural French\ncommunity. Having been\nacquitted of attempting to\nprospering group to leave\ntheir settlement.\nIt is on a trip to the local\ntown, populated by thugs,\nthat one of the more\nstubborn of the group, a courageous wimp\nengagingly played by\nMichael Moriarty, is saved\nfrom another beating by a mysterious stranger, (no\nprizes for guessing, Clint\nEastwood). His arrival\nencourages the group to\nstay on and causes the\nRichard Dysart to call in a group of mercenaries led\nby Johgn Russell, with\nwhom the stranger has a score to settle.\nBecause the baddies\nmurder Bernard, her\nsexually perverted\nhusband, her childhood\nand schooldays, when she\nknew a type of innocence,\nare displayed by Mauriac\nas if they were a kind of\nat tone ment. The book\nfollows her through her\nlater career in Paris; she\nspecialised in seducing\nyoung men. It cuts through\nthe facades of wealth and\ncom par it ive poverty, and\ngait y and madness to show\nthe tortured soul of\nTherese. Until she is near\nher death she seemed\nunable to commit anything\nother than evil. This story\nwill shake any readers out\nof a cosy conviction that\naren't really sufficiently\nwicked, their comeuppance does not provoke\nthe wild cheering in the\naisles that it should, but\nelsewhere, particularly on\nhis first appearance, Clint\nmanipulates the audiences\nemotions with skill. The\nsuperb photography by\nBruce Sergees and the\nsexual tension between\nClint and the two leading\nwomen, Sydney Penny and\nCorrie Snodgrass, raises\nthe film above the ordinary\nwestern.\nLifeforce has such\na dreadful script, culled\nfrom all the worst 50's science-fiction B features,\nthat it is almost funny.\nApart from that it is a bism al gy no phobic garbage. It is\na disaster movie, not only\nbecause it involves mass\ndeath and destruction, (of a form not unlike fast-acting\nAIDS), but also because it\nis a disaster, of a dangerous and obscene\nkind. Still I hear it broke\nt ne box office record at\nLeicester Square. So what\ndo I know?.\nOn a lighter note, I would\nlike to mention the\ncompletion of a new\ncinema, an all too rare\nevent.The Metro is an\na tractive peice of postmodernist architecture and\nin spite of looking as\nthough it was still being\nbuilt, it opened last week\nwith Dim-Sum and Je Vous\nSalue Marie, to be reviewed\nnext week.\nthey are s in less.( Penguin \u00b03.95)\nLife and times of Michael KJ M Coetzee, (winner of the\nBooker Prize).\nA slightly pretentious book\n\u2014 though I suppose that's allowed if you've won the\nBooker Prize. About a man\nwho, due to his malformed\nface, lived out the\nphilosophy 'man is an\nisland'. Due to this he was\nable to cope more easily\nthan others with the trauma\nof civil war and\nimprisonment in a camp,\nand challenges somewhat\nthe readers attitudes to\ndisabled or disfigured\npeople. A fairly good book.\nFELIX Friday 18 October 13\n\n"

    "content": "Why Indsoc\nMust Go\nEx-FELIX Editor Steve Marshall expresses his\nopinion on the Industrial Society.\nHave you noticed there is a new and ever more\ncomplacent type of student\nat IC? Collectively they are\nknown as the Industrial\nSociety. But what is it and\nwhat are its aims? It\npostures and camouflages\nitself as a Union club but it\ncomes from outside and is\nultimately controlled by\nthose who would seek to\nbulldoze students into a career in industry before\nthey have had the chance\nto freely reflect and form\nopinions of their own about\nthe desirability of such a career. And it does this by\nclandestinely getting its\nfinger in the pie three years\nbefore there's anything like\na reason to justify it. I would like to take the\nopportunity of presenting\nhere a few personal\nopinions of such a trend,\nwhich I see as yet another\nnail in the coffin of Imperial\nCollege and a gradual\nwhittling away of a free and\nunprejudiced student area\nin which to i earn, have fun\nand mould opinions and\nideas as the bedrock of any\nfuture thought about\nanything and everything.\nIn my time I have\ndigested much of the\nambience of Imperial\nCollege and hence\nformulated more than a few\nviews about it, and, in\nparticular, I have probed its\ndullness to the hilt, and its\nappalling sparsity of\ninsight. About its root\ncause? A complete lack of\nany kind of creatively\nrebellious element on\ncampus. But, I feel, as ever,\nthat things can always be\nchanged and so here are\nsome views I should like to\ndisseminate amongst you.\nFor a start, let's face it\nthat the students who run\nIndustrial Society are a rare\nbreed indeed, though,\nun for tu at ely, far from\nextinct. They are people\nwho spontaneously\nejaculate with emotion at\nthe prospect of a new\nforeclosure and being 'in\nthe know' about an exciting\nnew merger. But we all\nknow that industry is a grind for all those but the\npri vili ged few who reach\nthe top by treading on\nothers.\nTo attempt to present\nsuch a deathly dull\nboredom as 'More\ninteresting than I could\nhave imagined' and to\nglamor is e it as 'a good\nlaugh' and to speak of 'free\ndrinks on the firm' which\nare provided by the theft of\ndecent wages for those\nwho work at the sharper\nend of industry is both\nshabbily dishonest and a blatant shitting on the\nheads of those who do the\nreal work in industry\u2014the\noppressed majority.\nAnd those students who\nhave recently joined, no\ndoubt as a result of a certain fresher s gullibility\nthat is only to be expected,\nshould be aware that they\nare merely tokens in the\nf radula nt power games\ntaking place now in\nuniversities throughout the\ncountry. That their token\nsupport is what will make it\nincreasingly difficult for the\nIndustrial Society to be\nseen as an undesirable\nintruder in an academic\nenvironment is quite plain.\nIronically, any attempt to\nremove them will be hailed\nby them as a suppression\nof freedom, but, at the end\nof the day, Carl Burgess,\nICU President, must have\nthe courage of his\nconvictions and boot the\nwhole travelling circus off\ncampus. And there is no\nneed at all for him to\nexpend effort trying to\njustify his actions fearing\ncrucifixion at Council and\nthe UGM because it is clear\nthat the Industrial Society\nis nothing more than an\nimmense and deviously\nclever PR exercise as\nunwelcome and\nretrospectively obvious as a smear of shit on a toilet\ndoor. But it stinks far worse\nbecause it is underhand\nand has been slipped in\nbefore anyone noticed what\nthey were up to. Its a con-trick because you don't realise and register\nconsciously what such an\ninfluence is doing to you,\nespecially when you're new\nto student life and frankly\nlack the nous to see what' s happening here.\nLet me list what's wrong\nwith it and why it has to go.\nIt is a restricting of ideas. It\nis a cramping of university\nlife by its continual\nreference to what happens\nat the end of it as if College\nitself were merely a stepping stone \u2014 this is a com tempt i ble idea and\ntends to obscure the value\nof a university education\nand steals from those who\nmay choose other more\naesthetic things in life and\nwho turn their back on\npower struggles and\nseriously believe the planet\nis in danger of being\nreduced to a cold and\nruthless rubble of\ndwindling significance\nprecisely because of such\nshallow attitudes to life in\ngeneral, foisted upon\nimpressionable students\nwho thought they could be\nfree of such influences in\nwhat is supposed to be a society of diverse and\nfascinating people. But\nthey're all the same and\nthey want everyone else to\njoin in and become faceless\nboring, uninspiring\nautomatons in a big\nmachine they think they\ngrasp the consequences of,\nwhereas really they have\nbeen press uri sed by hard-sell and the threat of not\ngetting a job in a cult\nfer v our which demands of\nits devotees an astounding\nand no doubt lucrative\nreverence for the great god\nIndustry. In return they are\npromised a job which they\ncould have got anyway.\nAnd so they miss out on\nuniversity and all it has to\noffer in a blinding\nallegiance to complacency\nand all the canker such an\nattitude shovels out into\nsociety.\nBut much much worse\nthan all of this is the fact\nthat it is a sprawling and\npervading debasement of\none's leisure time to feel\nobliged to look to one's masters in industry at the\nend of three years. And so\n\u2014 called recreation\nobtained through such a social' society can never\nbe divorced from the\nreason behind, why you are\nthere ko c king back the\ngratis drinks \u2014 the\npremature ingratiating of\nyourself with those who will\nrule your lives at the end of\nit just because you have let\nthem. It truly is a horrible\nthing to have turned up to\ntinker with your enjoyment\nof life here at Imperial. To\narrive at college to find you\nare already being\nmanipulated by people who\nhave no right to be granted\nsuch influence over you is\na shame-faced incongruity\nand its ef flu via spreads\neverywhere its Thatcherite\nideology. To feel obliged to\nmake ugly decisions about\nwhether membership of\nsuch a society will improve\nyour chances of a job is\nnot what the Union is all\nabout and such a society\nshould not be granted\nUnion status. It is an\ninterloper.\nSuch a discouragement\nof free and critical thought\nby a foisting of early\ncommit t ment and this\nwhole phenomenon of self-seeking student barons of\nindustry with their rapidly\nmaturing obscene\nwallowing greed and slimy\npresumptions in disguise as\nordinary students with\ngenuinely sincere and\nalt uri tic interest in the\nsubject of industry is the\nsaddest thing that has ever\ncrawled out of a shit-heap\nand into a student\nenvironment.\nSfeve Marshall\nFELIX Friday 18 October 7\n\n"
