OP SOC\nMonday was the first night of the Gilbert arid',Sullivan Group's production of the -\" Plates of Penzance\" 'The Opera is about a gang of pirates who lose all their battles because they will not attack anyone weaker than themselves. One of their rules is that they will not hurt an orphan. It just so happens that the ships they meet all appear to be manned entirely by orphans. The fun begins when the pirates discover a bevy of beautiful maidens in a deserted cave and decide to marry them on sight. The\nhero, Colin Davis, and. the Heroine, Susan-Browne, both sang beautifully and the pace\nof the opera was such that interest-was never lost,: The Pirates 'will run till Friday and makes a very enjoyable evenings, entertainment,, The Producer was Ambrose Winship\nand the. musical Director Robin White, |\n-V \u2022/ ' BATHS MANAGER\nAb announced in yesterday's Union Meeting a Baths Manager has been appointed for* the Swimming Pool in the Sports Centre, due to open in the summer.

If student grants do not increase as much as the cost of living increase, then\nUniversity and College expenses such as halls of residence fees and refectory prices should be tied,( ii) Where students are required to undergo professional vacation training, their total income in these periods should not fall below their term time income,\n( iii) As a small number of IC students lose more than \u00a3 3 0 per annum as a result of the means test, ways of helping them should be investigates. In view of the present ec on mic situation it is hoped that the required cutback in spending is not affected by the removal of Discretionary Grants. At present these\ngrants cover cases such as an extra gran-;: for a repeated year, or field courses.\nFor the majority of IC students present grants are just sufficient for those\nliving at home cr in ICI halls of residence, but students in lodgings are beginning\nto su ffe Jp \u00abBbin recommendation, therefore, is that efforts should be directed towards\nalleviating the effects of rising costs of living on students. Extension of the use of\nthe Rent Tribunals, and increasing the ac como dati on in student houses and halls of\nresidence is suggested*\nDiscretionary grants, university and college expenses, vacation training and of the\nmeans test are being taken up with the college authorities. The support of any national action on these issues is recommended.\nLETTER\nDear Sir, It is regrettable that your report of Dr. Rose'stalk to the I.R.C. on \"The Abuse\nof Science in Vietnam\" did not extend to cover the discussions which followed. In this\nnot only were some of his basic facts queried but also the conclusions which he drew\nfrom other, un challenge able, facts,(\" The United States has conducted research on Plague\norganisms\"....\" In the last few years, in South Vietnam, cases of Plague have markedly\nincreased\".,. Thus? Dr. Rose did not complete this logical sequence but, when invited to do so, had to admit that there is no evidence whatever to suggest that the U.S. employ o. the use of such organisms in South Vietnam).\nIn his efforts to portray the U.S. as a particularly ra as ty Goliath to the pristine white Viet Cong \"Freedon Fighters\" David, Dr. Rose revealed himself as more interested in disseminating anti-American propaganda than discussing the basic moral questions\ninvolved in the use of Science to conduct modern warfare. The interests of the\nscientific corr iri unity would better have been served if Dr. Rose had argued the case that\nany type of war is an abuse of Science, no matter who pulls the trigger or bh rows the bomb.\nYours faithfully WHAT'S ON E.

    "content": "Issue No. 256 = 2 LATE NEWS UNION MEETING AIXTOURNBD TO THURSDAY 1-15 P,m \u00bb\nMotions to be discussed are: Derek BootLiman*s marathon (see \"What's wrong with our\nUnion\" notices around the College), Ian Wells on another constituent college rep on\ncouncil, and Barbara Hedge on action on the grants cut. CORR'S MOTION FAILS IN QUORATE UNION MEETING\nDermott Corr's motion-that the President of ICU should be democratically elected by-all members of ICU failed to achieve the necessary 2/3 majority by 3 votes after a paper\nballot at yesterday's Union meeting.\nProposing the motion, Corr pointed out that election by the Union floor would lead\nto greater student participation in the Union, and would mean the President was better known. Opposing, Chris O 'Donnell based his arguments on the assumption that students\nwere not to be trusted with such an important matter, and that it was better left to\nthose who knew-to whit, joint council. Several good speeches followed, producing among\nthem an expose of the petty politic king and lobbying of the present system, and - for the opposition - the valid point that large scale camp a ing ning before exam time would\nmean that the candidates' exam results would be somewhat affected; this might act as a deterrent to good candidates. The final result:206 for,108 against: 209 votes were\nrequired. There were also a few abstentions. The meeting was, incredibly enough,\nquo rate0 Dayglo publicity really works I Other points of the meeting in brief: two technical motions passed were, first, the jt 'disguised' or part-time students be members of ICU, and second, that the welfare\nofficer, External Affairs officer, and ULU agent be elected from the union floor. The\nUGC has given ICU a \u00a3 9 0 0 0 furniture grant for the student houses. Surprisingly enough,\nthe minutes of the last meeting were incorrect; at least somebody noticed. The meeting was adjourned for a continuation next Thursday for a marathon motion\nfrom Derek Boothman. Whether Thursday's meeting will be as lively, worthwhile or\nquo rate, is very dubious, Thursday's motions will give a chance for another crack at\ngetting Presidential elections from the Union floor, LETTjR \"ALL THE WAY WITH RAY'\nDear Sir, Although a lot of Editorial in FELIX has been in connection with Ray Phillips, our\nUnion President, I have failed to notice any credit given to him, or appreciation for his work o Do I get the impression that certain members of Council are trying to run Mr,\nPhillips down? If this is so, I think it is time some of us took time off to show our\nappreciation, Ray Phillips has proved himself time after time to be very efficient and capable of doing his job in a very competent manner, I am sure that his whole\ninterest is in helping us to 'get a better deal' and yet how many of us take an interest in the Union or attend its meetings - and how many of us take the trouble to show Ray\nthat we DO appreciate all he does for us, and that his efforts are not in vain?\nMay I say \"Many thanks for your efforts in helping to acquire the long needed\nStudent Houses, Mr, Phillips, and many thanks for all you have done for us,\"\nThree cheers for our President, and I hope I am speaking for all of us when I say,\n\"We're behind you all the way, Ray,\"\nYours faithfully P.3. Baker - Chemical Engineering.\nANOTHER FIRE\nEarly last'Monday evening , the Fire Brigade received several reports of a fire in the new Sports Centre under construction in Princes Gardens, Five fire appliances\nduly arrived to investigate and found that a workman s hut had caught fire for some\nunknown reason. The fire was swiftly extinguished and the rest of the site checked\nbefore the Brigade left, CHINESE NEW YEAR\nAround 240 people, mostly Asians, celebrated the Chinese New Year in semi-traditional style in Holy Brompton Church Hall last Saturday night. The main attraction of the evening were an excel lant seven-o our se Pekinese-style\nmeal and the Ribbon, Sword and Lion dances, all preformed with enthusiasm and energy.\nDancing was to a Chinese group, the Jets, who played strictly non-Chinese music, ATV\ntelevision were there to film the proceedings. In the words pf Chinese Society chair man, Au Chao Shu, the Chinese Society exists to propagate Chinese culture. This being\nso, it is a pity more British students did net partake of the festivities, "

The views expressed in these letters are not\nnecessarily those of the editor.\nThe\nColcutt\nClique\nSir,\nThere was a time (or so the\nstory goes) when \" Colcutt \" gave\nvent to some much needed and\nrelevant criticism on the state of\naffairs at I.C. Now, however, it seems to\nhave become a mere extension of\nthe sort of cliquish introspection\nwhich it purports to despise. For\nan article to attempt to satirize\nthe actions of a body of people\nsupposedly divorced from the\nmass of students is obviously\nfutile. Since few people know\nthe personalities involved few\npeople are going to appreciate the\nanalogies drawn.\nIt's about time Colcuit stopped\nboring the average I.C. student\nand wasting his allocated space.\nIf he must air his enormous wit,\nperhaps he could distribute a fortnightly quip-sheet to his fellow council members.\nMeanwhile, perhaps we could\nhave more constructive criticism\nfrom him in Felix.\nJONATHAN SHIELDS\nMaths 2\nSir,\nSince my first day at I.C. last\nOctober ,1 have had \" apathy \"\nstuffed down my throat, one way\nor another, and I am sick to the\nback teeth of it.\nEverywhere I turn I hear the\nmoans and groans of frustrated\nand lethargic second and third\nyears, complaining bitterly about\nthis amorphous apathy from\nwhich I.C. is suffering. And when\nI retort that they have only themselves to blame, when I declare\nthat I do not intend to allow my\nmind to be an aes thetis ed, they\nsmile patronising ly, as if to say\n\" You're a fresher (\u2014distasteful\nword\u2014), you wait until you've\nbecome old and wise like us and\nsee what you think then.\"\n\" Old and wise \" my sweet \u2014!\nApathy is what one associates\nwith morons, not with intelligent\nyoung people\u2014or did I get it\nwrong about the \" top five per\ncent\"? Either way, it's the last\nthing I would have expected to\nhave found here.\nIn fact, it's not apathy at all\nthat has I.C. by the throat. What\nit all boils down to is that life at\nI.C. is not as cushy as we expected it to be, and this has led\nsome people to adopt nega ti vi stic attitudes and to blame their own\nlaziness on such a conveniently\nnebulous thing as apathy. And\nit is those few rotten apples which\nhave spoilt the barrel.\nThe amount I could write on\nthis subject you wouldn't have\nroom to print, but let me briefly\nCOL CUT T An interesting letter from the\nDirector to our Resident clown\ncame into my hands the other\nday :\nDear Flippant,\nIt has come to my notice that\nyou and council are staying up\nbeyond your bedtimes. How do\nyou do it when you accomplish so\nlittle ? I note also that there is\na resignation epidemic among\ncouncil. One down, three or\nfour with heavy fevers, and who\nknows how many to come. Most\nof you started your jobs around\nthe same time as myself. Perhaps the resignations are a result\nof disillusion due to the obstacles\nwhich rise before anyone who\nattempts to change anything : I too have discovered the apparent\nimmobility here. I therefore wish\nto inform you, Mr. Resident, of\nmy decision to resign.\nYours, P. After this startling revelation,\nanything else shades into importance. Are you looking for entertainment ? Try one of EC's most\namazing shows, now in its eighth\nfantastic month: The Cra-;;\nWorld of Keith Guy, with his\nown gro u o, Ents.\nAnd who's the promoter ? The\nexecutive ? The promoter doesn't always ao prove: Martin I a ck told Ents \" I ast year we had\ncattle-markets for ne ople tif't like\nme; this year you're trying to\nmake them into dances.\" And\nEnts don't always approve.\nSeems the exec, with council's backing has stopped them using\nthe Union lower lounge for hops.\nWhy ? Maybe so that all those\nalcoholic Icwarians you see lying\ndrunkenly around the lower\nlounge won't have to miss out\nSaturday nights.\nOr maybe for all the people\nwho use the lounge every Saturday night. A maximum of 40,\nEnts reckoned last term on those\nweekends they were using the\ntop refectory instead. And some\nof the 40 had come from the hop.\nIs this minority worth satisfying\nwhen there are similar and better\nfacilities on the same campus in\nSouthside ?\nAnd why, you may ask, do\nEnts want to use the lower\nlounge rather than the top re fec tory. You can get a better at-p here in the lower lounge; the\nlower lounge has a much better\nfloor for dancing. Most of us\nknow the usual atmosphere in the\ntop refectory and the usual smell\nof c hippies. The plastic fairytale\nused it because there weren't enough people for the lower\nlounge.\nBut there are three factions concerned : the executive, the Ents\ncommittee and our old friend,\nKeith Guy. Guy, we all know, is\nan organising genius. He said\nthree weeks before Guy Fawkes\nnight that he would get the fire-works. But Dermott Corr and\nJacques Robinson had to chase\nsome up on November 3rd. And\nhe asked two people to fix the\ngroup for one week at the plastic\nfairytale: both arrived. Fortunately one played for free.\nBut a last question for you ?\nDo you like Ents publicity this\nyear ? Martin Lack is sceptical:\nThis year,\" he told Ents,\n\" You're sending out works of\nart, not posters.\" Perhaps if\nEnts don't go to pot, they'll turn\nto it.\nsay what 1 think could be done\nlest all of us\u2014Mr. Malcolm\nDuckett included\u2014are drowned\nin this \" apathetic \" ces s which is\nI.C.'s heritage.\nThe prime objective should be\nthe unification of the student\nbody. As it stands at the moment the word Union is a mis-no mer, and the blame for it is\nshared equally between the totally\nuninspiring and wet-blanket\nleadership of the Union Exec,\nand those who have allowed these\npeople to obtain such office.\nRadical changes are needed, in\naddition to changing the Presidential Election system, I advocate the introduction of a sabbatical year as the only way of\ngetting an undergraduate President without it becoming the consolation prize for a Pass degree\nInter-college rivalries should be\nrevived as a means of encouraging active participation, and\ngreater involvement in student\naffairs; for an active body is a healthy body, and active minds\nwill become stagnant if we choose\nto ignore the facts.\nThe potential dangers of nega-ti vi stic and couldn't care-less attitudes in such a renowned seat of\nlearning as I.C. are frightening,\nand unless the myth of apathy is\nexploded I can only imagine that\nthis, my generation, will become\nas void, as sterile as the one which\nruns this, our country, at the present moment.\nC.J. KENT\nEm ci pati on Sir,\nR se incident f the\nfour . /an n the Unu.u Bar,\nI find their au ion commendable,\nand your comment on it de pl or able.\nWhether or not you and others\nlike you consider the fair sex to\nbe inferior, they do have equal\nrights, and as there exists no\nUnion bye-law which forbids\ntheir presence in the Union Bar\nthey are free to use it\u2014though\nI'm not surprised at the revulsion\nwhich the mere thought Of doing\nso normally causes them.\nSo for your fears that women\nare trying to dominate us, have\nyou stopped to consider that it\nmay be simply that they are dissatisfied with the way in which\nwe men handle things. Mayhs\na Lady President of I.C.U. would\nbe a vast improvement\u2014she certainly couldn't do worse. And\nwh v otherwise should I. C.W.

The difficulty ;\n< that this has,\ndue to the vagaries of the printing profession, to b. vr it ten almost\na week before most people will read it. In that one .vee k th re is\na Union meeting, which could change the circumstances of any of\nthese subjects.\nAssuming nothing unexpected happens two motions presented\nto the Union meeting were, to have a ballot throughout the Union\nfor the President, and to lower the quorum at Union meetings.\nLike the \" shall-we-or-shan't we-join-NUS \" debate, the election\nof a President from the body of the Union rather than, as now, by\nCouncil, is a hardy perennial and arouses a lot of feeling, mostly irrational. A lot of red herrings are strewn about; in this case the chief\none is presented by the \" Democracy at any Price \" brigade. Democracy is not an end in itself, purely a means to the end of getting\na good President. Assuming it was passed yesterday then you have\nanother chance to vote on the matter at the next Union meeting. The\nissue at stake is whether Council, most of whose members know the\ncandidate personally, is better equipped to choose a President than\nthe whole Union.\nIt seems to me that lowering the quorum of Union meetings is\nattacking the problem from the wrong end. The emphasis should be\non at tra cung people, not on reducing the quorum to fit the number\nattending.\nThe quorum of Union meetings is there to protect you, the members of the Union, from small groups of people taking advantage of\nthe rest of the Union. Lower it at your peril.\nThe public image of students is, if not at an all-time low, then\nsomething approaching it. The reasons for this are two-fold. Firstly,\nwe suffer from the ill-informed attitude that we lead an easy life, reinforced by the fact that many students do lead such a life. However,\nmost students probably work harder than their contemporaries in\nemployment. The fact that he has been working until 2 a.m. is\nnot obvious to anyone seeing a bleary-eyed student at il o 'clock\nin the morning. The only thought to enter the mind of the genera!\npublic is that everyone else has to be at work at 8 o 'clock and the\nlazy student isn't even out of bed. The second, and more rational,\nreason is that in the public's view students are irresponsible, and\nmany are. In the last few months 450 plastic parking cones, a large\nnumber of parking meter covers and at least one complete meter have\nbeen stolen, probably by I.C. students. If you add to this the nuisance\ncaused to-the general public at such times as Morphy Day and the!\nregular chaos emanating from the Union Bar at closing time. ;\ns it\nsurprising we are not the best-loved section of the community ':\nAll this, of course, puts us in a weak bargaining position, since,\nwhether we think of it as such or not, the grant is not given us as a right and if we really do waste vast quantities of other people's money,\nthose people have the unquestionable prerogative of withdrawing their\nsupport. If we are, as a whole, irresponsible, then obvious lv no one\n\\\\ ill give us power and resp Dns i bil it y.1 do not think that we do waste vast amounts of money, nor\nthat students are irresponsible as a body, but those elements of the\nstudent body who are not tes pons i ble are those who are noticed.\nWhich brings me to the question of the proposed cut in the grants\nrise. Are we being irresponsible in objecting to it ? I don't think\nso. However, there are some points which must be considered. The\ncountry, of which most of my readers are a part, is in an economic\nmess; the causes of this are irrelevant here, the responsibility for\ngetting back to a healthy economy is as much ours as it is that of\neveryone else in the country. One of the methods the Government\nhas decided to use is a cut in the standard of living. Clearly a cut\nin everyone else's living standards accompanied by a rise in our own\nis just ri-dic u lou us. Most students are not poverty-stricken, anyway,\nalthough many are having great difficulty in making ends meet. It\nwould be difficult to find a similar sized group of people of comparable age who are as widely travelled as students, for instance,\nalthough in general this is achieved with the aid of large student reductions. No, the reason why the cuts are unacceptable in their present\nform is because, as I mentioned above, some students arc suffering\ngrave financial difficulties. There can be few students in the College\nwho manage solely on their LEA grants and vacation earnings. Most\nof us rely to some extent on our parents for free or cheap accommodation in the vacations, some clothing or just hard cash. Not\neveryone's parents can afford to sub sid is e them like this and these\nare the ones who lose out.\nThe long-term solution is obviously a raising of grants to a level\nwhere students can be completely self-supporting with the abolition\nof the means test. No one over the age of 1\n8 should have to be partially dependent on his parents. A short-term solution in line with\nthe economic situation of the country is difficult to find, but perhaps\nan acceptance of the cuts, providing a guarantee of a review in a year,\nrather than the normal three years, coupled with a\" means test in\nreverse \" to selectively increase the grants of those who would be\nunable to live on the new rate is reasonable.\nF HX Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel.

Wells Society, the largest club in the college, hat just\nhad its 100th meeting. To mark this occasion FELIX asked Sinclair\nGoodlad, President of Wells Soc, since its inception, for his view\nof the society.\nMONDAY NIGHT IS.... Wells Soc Night! And so it has been every Monday night of the\nAutumn and Spring Terms since 7th October, 1963. Since Sinclair\nGoodlad and some Touchstone s rgu crs dreamed the society up, 100\nplenary meetings have been addressed by a galli mau fry of the weird\nand wonderful ranging from Phil Haskell the only undergraduate\nto have addressed the society-\u2014to the President of the Royal Society.\nProf. Blackett was not only the 20th member of the college to speak,\nbut also the 14th Fellow of the Royal Society.\nAverage attendance at meetings has been 100\u2014the lowest ever\nbeing 6 for a talk on the problem of force in politics, the highest (500\nplus) for live demonstrations of explosions and hypnotism. (Moral?)\nThe talks alone represent some 10,000 man-hours of edification and\nenjoyment, to say nothing of the many hours of questioning, discus-sion, eating, drinking, experimenting, etc. What's it all about?\nSinclair Goodlad\nAdvertising Agency :\nEducational Publicity (Partners)\nLtd.

Wellsoc tries to keep\nahead of the pop press\u2014the\nTimes, Guardian etc.\u2014by pumping science journalists for advance news on \" in \" science. Because someone has decided to\nmajor in one .oj ect, he should\nnot have to a j and on interest in\n- !\n1 other subjects. Indeed, with\n\u2022 creasing cross-fertilisation between disciplines, it is essential to\nbe aware of major developments\nin fields of activity other than\none's own.\nOn tap or on top? Churchill wanted his scientists\non tap but not on top; Wells\ndreamed of Utopia governed by\nengineers\u2014the homo genis ed society with salvation through air-conditioning. Wellsoc holds neither such extreme doctrine, but\nbelieves that science and engineering are of compelling interest\nwhen directly linked with the\nsatisfaction of human needs.\nSome of these needs can be\nreadily identified-artificial foods;\nproblem of ageing; land use;\npopulation control; etc. Others\nare the subject of economic/poli-t ical debate\u2014how to forecast for\ntechnology; how much of the\ncountry's resources to spend on\nR&D; the technological gap between rich Jand poor countries;\netc. Still other needs can only be\nidentified -by the direct study of\nmotivations\u2014through an thro po logy, sociology, psycho-analysis,\npsychiatry, psychology, (neuro-physiology. Wellsoc has persistently tried to relate the enjoyment of science and technology\nas mind-stretching activities to\nthe purposes they exist for.\nLapses into Lunacy Science is most challenging\nwhen up against the most difficult\nsubjects; that's also where science\nencounters the lunatic fringe!\nWells more or less invented\nBritish Science Fiction; by contrast Wellsoc is getting a national\nreputation for sympathetic debunking in the shadow-world between science-fiction and science-fact-LNM; medium ship; ghosts;\nflying saucers\u2014trying to distinguish the genuine from the crack-pot.

This makes\neconomic sense because publicity is a minor expense.\nThere's no point having a decent speaker if you keep it secret\nOur posters haven't been up to\nmuch this year; but it seems\nthat the hard-core membership\nof lively minds prefer facts to\npsychedelic sex stimuli.\nSwellS oc? Depends on what you want,\nthere's terrific room for improvement :\n1. i.C. is too parochial. It would\nbe a terrific stimulus if meetings could be shared with other\ncolleges and students (male and\nfemale) of the social sciences,\nphilosophy, etc. Is there a If nio nool i cv on this?\nFungoid Growth hi Maoneyville ? Psychaedelic Plastic Pasta\nNo\u2014just what hap pca ad at a Wellsoc Manifestation.\n2. We haven't succeeded in making attractive the very important meetings on the cost of\nscience, technological gap, etc.\nIn fact, attendances at meetings are almost inversely proportional to the political importance of the subject. If I.C. graduates aren't informed and\nconcerned about such matters,\nGod only knows who is.\n3. Serious study groups need to\nbe developed more fully. The\nIC 2000 group attracts less interest at present than the one\non UFOs. Lord RitchieCalder on problems for technologists in the Year 2000 drew\nonly 30 at an open meeting\u2014\nless than 1 per cent of the student population land 0.5 per\ncent of the staff. These are the\nsubjects where one would expect vigorous dialogue between\nstaff and students.\n4. More social contact needed\nbetween members. The committee is working on this and\ntrying to avoid the exhausted\nlapse into beer-sodden cacophony f/ here any intellectual\nexchange is systematically\ndrowned \u00bbby dec i belligerence. Maybe 100 meetings represents\nachievement. But it's only take-off. More. Bigger. Better.\nFaster. Furiouser. As Wilde said,\nNothing succeeds like excess.\nSuccess See ret? No room for complacency;\nonly 25 per cent of the college\ncome to any meetings at all. But\nsome items of deliberate policy\nmay help:\n1. Subjects for discussion which\nare not dehydrated and des sica ted for iron-ration text-books\nwhere the lively mind can\nmake original suggestions j by penetrating questioning;\n2.

The probable constitution of this would be Mr.\nStephenson, the Senior Warden,\nthe President of the Union and a warden of a Hall not involved in\nthe dispute.\nAnd so to the motions. Working parties were set up to produce Standing Orders for Union\nMeetings, to look into the revision of allocation of Union places\nin Hall, the constitution of the\nFelix, Phoenix and Carnival\nBoards and the Student Finance\nCommittee, the arrangements for\nFreshers Day and the provision\nof special facilities for P.G. s especially out of term time. A motion to set up a working party to\nlook into the possibility of student representation on the Governing Body was withdrawn when\nthe President explained that he\nhad consulted the Rector about\nthis. For full details sec story\non page 4.\nA motion proposed by Malcolm Duckett that Council should\nmeet at least once a fortnight,\nthus taking over many of the\nduties of the Executive, which\nwould be replaced by an \" emergency committee \" was considerably watered down and it was\nfinally decided to hold at least\nthree this term as an experiment.\nAnother part of the same motion\nthat Council meet v ear rens once\na term became that ani lot meeting with year reps will be held\nsoon.\nA rush of people seconded\nMiss Pearson's motion approving\nthe principle of mixed Halls ot\nResidence, which was passed\nnem con. Ian Wells, President\nof Mines, proposed that one rep\nfrom each constituent college\nshould be elected at the Union\nAGM, this narrowly squeaking in\non the President's casting vote.\nOther points worth mentioning\nwere that the owners of approximately 30 parking places, which\nare vacant each day, mostly belonging to students, would be\nlikely to lose them if they were\nnot used. The Rector is looking\ninto the question of careers ad-vice, as well as lectures on civil\nrights, insurance and taxation for\nGeneral Studies.\nMr. Duckett wrote this letter to\nhis resignation.\nSir,\nFollowing my resignation from\nCouncil I wish to make a statement as to my reasons; and\nmake some comments on the present state of the Union, and,\nmore particularly, of Council. I wish to do this as I feel the\nUnion is totally uninformed as to\nwhat goes on, and as their ex-representative on Council, I am\nin the position to inform them.\nI have resigned from Council\nbecause of the greatest possible\ndisgust and disillusionment in the\nway the Union is managed. The\nmanagement (i.e. Council, not the\nExecutive as they seem to think)\nis incompetent to run the Union\nin a way beneficial to most students here.\nFrom the top to the bottom the\nmajority of Council members,\nwith one or two exceptions, are in-competent, reactionary and fail to\nact in the interests of the Union,\nand even fail to hold any respect\nfor the Union as a whole.\nThe Executive is guilty of failing to carry out their duties pro-per ly, and have shown a flagrant\ndisregard for Student opinion and\nthe Union Bye Laws. On at least\nfour occasions they have ignored\nBye Laws, formulated to prevent\nthe abuse of Executive power and\nto protect the welfare of ordinary\nstudent members. Three (and\npossibly another one) of these\nFELIX explaining the reasons for\nconcern discipline, which is Council-controlled, on which the\nExecutive took action. Twice this\nwas after a warning from Council\nto cease this practice. On the\nother they failed to publish an\nagenda to a Union Meeting, the\none concerning parking charges\n(which should have drawn large\nnumbers), resulting in yet another\nin quo rate meeting.\nThe Secretary has failed to\nwrite a letter when instructed to\nby Council, although he did very\nmuch later when he was \" re-minded.\" This concerned an\napology to another college for\ninconvenience caused to them,\nand therefore a very urgent mat-ter.\nThe President has continually\nacted as though the Union was an\nautocracy, and shown total disregard for the wishes of Council.\nHis behaviour at Council Meetings has been appallingly flippant\nand discourteous to all, and has\nthus failed to gain the respect of\nany large fraction of students.\nWhen asked by Council, the body\nwhich elected him, or at least\ntwenty of the twenty-two student\nmembers, to hold a Council\nMeeting in the second week of\nthis term he refused to do so.\nInstead he made it abundantly\nclear that he did not feel answerable to Council. This was in the\nface of a large number of imp or Duckett Hits Out\nMalcolm MattA motion by Andrew Jordan\nregretting that a council meeting\nwas not held in the second week\nof term, when 20 student members of Council signed a letter requesting one, was passed by three\nvotes to two, and that this shall\nnot be construed as a precedent\nwas passed nem con.\nFinally, after a little obstruction by the chair, a letter handed\nto Mr. Phillips by Mr. Duckett,\nbefore he left the meeting during\na short break for refreshment, was\nread. This was Duckett's re sig nation, read at yesterday's Union\nMeeting and amplified in a statement printed in this issue. A vote of thanks for his work on\nCouncil was given to him.\ntant reform motions placed for\nthe meeting. Instead he made a mockery of the whole affair by\ncalling an informal meeting at\nwhich no business could be done.\nHe then proceeded to tell Council\nwhat was wrong With it and also\ndiscussed motions ,for the next\nCouncil Meeting. The whole affair\nwas a farce, and in no way a mus ing.\nIn an attempt to bring about\nconstitutional revision to combat\nthe rot at the top of the Union\nand to check the illegal action of\nthe Executive certain action was\nproposed. This action was supported by a majority of Council\noutside of an actual meeting even\ndown to a no confidence motion\non the President if he failed to\nhold the requested Council Meeting. I did not table such a motion as, with one or two exceptions, these people (all \" representing \" student interest) backed\ndown, with one or two notable\nexceptions, as they did on the\nmeasures to restructure Executive control.\nSo these people who agreed to\ndo something constructive, which\nthey agreed was in the best interests of the Union, failed to honour their verbal bond. I can only\nconclude that they are neither\nhonest nor acting in the interests\nof the students. It is mainly disillusionment (with these ip eo ole, who claim they are progressive,\nthat has led me to resign. I am\nunable to work with them to do\nthe things the union knew I stood\nfor when they elected me. At\nleast the Executive (with on6 ex-ce pti on) is straight-forward and\nNUS Protests\nGrants Cut\nTwo weeks ago Barbara Hedge, IC External Affairs Officers and\nMike Edwards foi m edt nel C delegation at the MS organised meeting\nat Birmingham University to decide about action on the grants cuts.\nTine following is Barbara Hedge's Account of the meeting :\u2014\nThe NUS Executive was of the opinion that we should not accept\nthe 50 per cent cut in any increase proposed by the Grants Advisory\nBoard without negotiation. This meeting was held so that the\nExecutive could find out the wishes of the majority of students and\nact accordingly.\nSpeakers were heard from the regional groups of NUS and the\nmajor student political societies and finally from individual\nuniversities.\nNottingham is the only university which as a whole dissociates\nitself from any campaign to raise\nthe grant. The points considered\nwrong with the grants system at\nthe moment were : \u2014\n(1) In 1965, the grant was cut by\n\u00a330 from the standard considered\nnecessary in 1961 and the probable increase in 1968 will not\nbring us up to the 1965 level.\nThere seems no point in having a Grants Advisory Board if its\nfindings are ignored.\n(2) Even if students can manage\nin '68 will they be able to in '71\nwhen the next grants review will\nbe undertaken.\n(3) The Local Education Authorities have had to cut expenditure.\nThis is liable to cut discretionary\nawards e.g. for vacation courses.\n(4) Some students e.g. married or\ni.i. lure students suffer badly in\nsome counties but are alright in\nothers. By devaluation students\nabroad lost \u00a330 overnight. These\nare just a few anomalies.\nThe reasons why a grants cam*\npa ign should be supported, and\nhow. are : \u2014\n(1) The cut is imposed \"for the\ntime being.\" If this means 3\nyears, students will be hit badly.\nAsk for a review after 1 year.\n(2) London Intercollegiate Hall\nfees have already gone up to\ncertainly more than the increase\nin the grant if the cut takes place.\nOther hall and refectory prices\nare sure to go up for next session.\nIf we don't ask for an increase in\nthe grant, it was proposed by a number of factions that we ask\nfor a freeze on such prices.\n(3) Students will find th?t they\nhave to take evening jobs as well\nas vacation jobs in order to pay\ntheir way. This could result in\noo en. So too are one or two other\nCouncil members, the ones I am\nin basic disagreement with and\ntherefore cannot work with. But\nthese neon le who promised sup-nor t, but failed to e ive it. or. as\nin one case, opposed it. have\nproved themselves incapable of\ncarrying out their duties.\nResigning from Council was\nnot an easy decision, but one I had to make. We should all be\nconcerned with the rot at the top\n(these are an RCS Fresher's words), as if there is disinterest\nand bad handling at the top. what\ncan anybody expect but apathy\nin the Union?\nI am making this statement because T am worried at what is\nhappening here, and think you\nshould know. Basically it is up\nto all*at us to put things right\nso please.take an. interest and\nsome action. The last Colcutt was\ntoo true to be funny.\nMALCOLM DUCKETT\nan increased failure rate and a bigger waste of public money.\n(4) Class distinction will occur as\nworking class families will not be\nable to rely on parents giving\nthem extra money so they won't come to university.\n(5) If we accept the cut we are in\neffect saying that we can manage\nwithout it and that we had too\nmuch in '61.\nThe reasons we should accept\nsuch a cut are : \u2014\n(1) A student only has to live on\na limited income for 3 years\nwhereas old age pensioners etc.\nhave no increase to look forward\nto.\n(2) If we say we can't live on the\ngrant we are offered, the alternative is loans.\n(3) Such a campaign will give us\na really bad public image.\n(4) We don't need the money.\nThe majority of views agreed\nwith a campaign to make sure\nthat students had enough money\nto live on with the anomalies in\nthe grant system removed Very\nfew people wanted immediate\nmilitant action. Reasoning with\nthe government was thought the\nmost sensible idea as the claims\nare justified.\nKings' Estimate\nGraham Searle. President of\nKings Union, has written a report\ngiving the average minimum expenditure for students in London,\nallowing only 10/- a week for\nconcerts, theatres , tobacco, al co hol, wireless licence and other\nforms of entertainment. Altogether \u00a369 10s a year (27/- a week) on personal expenditure is\nallowed, these items are not\ncatered for in the NUS recommendations, but Searle writes,\n\" trunk calls home, going home\nfor a weekend or half-term, dental\nor optical treatment, extra fuel\nneeds during an illness, contributions to charities and appeals,\ntravelling expenses for society\nvisits, fares or teas for sports\nfixtures, the celebration of a21 st or an engagement etc.\" are all\noutside the expenditure allowance\ncatered for in the NUS recommendations, although most people of our age would regard these\nas essential.\nHe suggests \u00a3450 for living in\nHall, \u00a3460 in lodgings and \u00a3345\nat home.\nAPOLOGY\nUnfortunatelv, due to lack of\nspace, a large amount' of con v received for this issue has had to be\nheld over until the next one, or\ncut altogether.

C. last Wednesday. After a couple\nof days of rain the pitch was wet,\nsticky and somewhat heavy, hut\nthis caused no trouble to those\nred shirted demons from South\nKensington; mud could not slow\ndown these powerful men.\nThe game commenced at a fast\nand unbelievable pace, the few\ninside forwards undoubtedly\ncovering at least a mile of gro and in the first five minutes. When\nthe I.C. inside-left had been revived by smelling salts, the game\ncontinued at a slightly slower\npace but still scintillating football\nwas produced.\nThe referee was fantastic and\nsome of his decisions had the\ncrowd screaming in amazement;\nthe climax of his magnificent performance came after a chest high\ntackle on I.C.'s inside right when\nhe awarded a drop-out from the\ntwenty five.\nAfter ninety minutes the eleven\nI.C. heroes trooped proudly off\nthe field, heads held high after\ntheir superb performance and if\nQ.M. C. had not scored 6 goals to\nI.C.'s0 they would probably\nhave gone completely off their\nheads. i However, I.C. has vowed to\nwin the next three sets 6-2, 6-3,\n6-1.\nDESMOND HACKETT\nHockey\nU.L. CUP REPLAY\nAt the end of last term, I.C. played Barts Hospital in the\nfirst round of the U.L. Cup. It\nwas a hard fought game, coloured by memories of our defeat in the final last year by the\nsame side, and it resulted in a1 all draw.\nOn Wednesday 17th January,\nthe replay was played at Harlington. The pitch was moist, but\nfirm, thus the ball ran wc il and\nthe players were hard pushed,\nafter the Christmas vacation, to\nkeep up with it. Barts played the\n4-2-3-1-1 system which seemed to\ngive them much more room and\nthey grasped control of the game.\nHalf-way through the first half\nthey scored and, as *?f ten happens\nin a Cup game, they closed the\ngame up, concentrating much\nmore on defence.\nI.C. tried very hard to break\nthis defence and in doing so were\nawarded a fair number of short\ncorners, but none of these were\ntaken full advantage of. Thus the\ngame was allowed to labour\nthrough the second half with no\nfurther score.\nResult: St. Bartholomew's Hospital 1, I.C.0. Cross cou ruy After their convincing win in\nthe UL championships the first\nteam were determined to overhaul Borough Road College in\nthe London League. Unfortunately international Barry Jones\nwas unable to Tun because of\ninjury and IC finished second\nonly a few points behind Borough\nRoad. The race was run on IC's home course in Richmond Park\nand the going was very firm, resulting in an extremely fast pace.\nThe scorers for 1C were Nick\nBarton 3rd, Norman Morrison\n4th, Tony Mason 12th, Howard\nSmith 18th. in Jones 24th and\nAshley Deans 31st. Entries are now pouring in for\nthe Hyde Park Relay which is the\nlargest road relay in the wo rid an.\norganised by Imperial College on\nFebruary 17th. About 110 teams\nare expected to be competing and\nthis means almost 800 athletes!\nEach team consists of 6 runners\nwho each run a3 mile leg round\nthe serpentine. Last year the\nrace was won by Edinburgh with\nIC twenty first. However this\nyear IC have one of their strongest teams ever so please come\nand cheer the race which starts at\n3 p.m. by the Serpentine. Would\nanybody who is willing to put up\na member of one of the German\nteams coming over for two nights\nplease contact me a.,< ard\nHall.\nI CW S Netball:\nRoyal Holloway came to I.C. to play Netball in the morning of\nSaturday 27th January. The\nteams were evenly matched and\na hard, fast game ensued with the\nscore even throughout most of\nthe game. Towards the end of\nthe match, Imperial deservedly\npulled away to win 20-17, The\nnetball team is having its best\n\u00bbe aS On for a long time, and sup-potters from Weeks Hall played\ntheir usual part.\nHockey:\nIn the same afternoon the\nladies hockey team played Royal\nHolloway II team. Imperial were\none player short and the team included layers who had never\nplayed j re, but what they\nlacked in experience they made\nup for in enthusiasm and tenacity.\nThe eventual result was an eight-three win for 1CW A. Badminton :\nOn Wednesday 31st January\nthe ladies Badminton team played\nRoyal Holloway at Nine Eims\nBaths. In a close game ICWA\nplayed well to win 6-3. This was\nprobably due to the presence and\nsupport of the I.C. Men's Badminton team\u2014who also won their\nmatch.\nSpecial congratulations to a certain Icwarian who played in all\nthree matches.\nsome w fee reP \u2122 \u2022\nwort M iii Join our mixed groups of|\nadventurous.people\nand see the most fascinating parts of the world on a realistic budget.

    "content": "7 FEBRUARY1968 FELIX7 How to make your\n.Degree go further\nAn IC girl's year in Africa\nJoan Lakin graduated in physics at IC in 1965 and subsequently\nobtained a Postgraduate Certificate of Education at the University of\nLondon Institute of Education. She 'hen applied to Voluntary Service\nOverseas and was sent to Nigeria j om year as a physics teacher.\nJoan taught at the Methodist Girls' High School in Lagos. Air travel\nto and from Nigeria was paid for and arranged by VSO. She received\na clothing allowance of \u00a340 before leaving England, and was paid at\nthe rate of \u00a3700 p.a. by the Nigerian Government. Rent-free accommodation was provided. She received are settlement allowance of\n\u00a3100 from VSO on her return to England, which was quite useful as\nshe i. JW back at IC as a postgraduate.\nJoan arrived in I. Mgos shortly after the second military coup\nwhich put Major General Gowon in charge of the Federal Military\nGovernment. Her stay was overshadowed by the political unrest\nwhich culminated in the secession of the Eastern Region (Biafra) from\nthe Federation.\nIn order to give an impression of her stay in Nigeria we print here\nextracts from letters written from Lagos to her family.\n\"1 am now slowly getting used to Lagos, although I bated it\nat first, with the filth, smells and beggars. Also people stare all the\ntime. I can't get used to the long nights with all the noise of fruit\nbats, crickets, and mysterious shuffling s and pattering s.I have a flat to myself on the school compound and below me two\nother VSO girls share a similar flat. At the moment we are trying to\nget used to our servants, Michael the cook and Matthias the \" small\nboy.\" Unfortunately they are a necessary evil because the climate\ndrains all one's energy away. We have found that even a simple job\nsoon wears us out, even though it is now the end of the wet season and\nis relatively cool.\n\" My school seems very well organised. The principal is Australian and the deputy Dutch. Both are very nice and helped us over our\nfirst few days.\nKeen Pupils\n\" Last weekend I had a ghastly attack of dysentery. Fdunately\nI had some sul ph on amide drugs to take in the event of such an occur-rence, and they cleared it up in about 24 hours. It was rather\nfrightening though, and my tummy felt funny for several days after-wards.\n\" I started school on Tuesday and at the moment feel absolutely\nexhausted. We start at 8.10 a.m. and finish, ostensibly, at 2.10 p.m. with two breaks, one of ten minutes and one of forty-five minutes.\nYesterday and today however, I have still been there at 3.15 p.m. for various reasons, and of course there's a couple of hours marking\nand lesson preparation to be done in the evening. This school is to\nLagos what St. Paul's is to London. The standard is very high\u2014\nthey are all frighteningly keen on\nmaths and physics\nI have been told that every\ngirl with very few exceptions\ndreams of being a mathematician\nor physicist, and consequently\nI am treated by the pupils with\nan awe and reverence which does\nnot endear me to the rest of the\nstaff. There were three new\nteachers to be introduced to the\nschool at assembly on Tuesday.\nThe first two were quietly re-ce i ved, but I received a round of\napplause.\nLast Saturday a man from the\nBritish Council and his wife took\nsix VSO's and three contract\nteachers on a canoe trip followed\nby lunch. We went ten miles out\nof Lagos along the road to\nIbadan and were paddled by\nnatives in dugout canoes along\na sluggish brown river fringed\nwith mangroves. It was- very\nstill and quiet\u2014I felt just like\nMungo Park ! On the way back\n.into Lagos we were stopped by\nan army road-block.\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification ?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nLAM LEY'S AM for your\u2014\nI BOOKS\ntw F ART MATERIALS\ntm\nv PAPER BACKS\n\u2022\nSTATIONERY\ns \u2022\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 Your accounts of blustery October days and autumn gardens\nmake me feel very homesick, especially as the climate is so\nghastly here at the moment. The\ntemperature stays at a few degrees above 80 both day and\nnight. That wouldn't be too bad\nif it weren't for the humidity. I feel as though I'm in a continuous Turkish bath and like\neveryone else feel very listless and\nbad-tempered.\nNight Club\nWe have just finished exams at\nschool and yesterday I marked\nthe last of the exam papers. The\nresults aren't very good. Most\nof them failed physics, which\ndidn't really surprise me. They\nlearn the work very well, but\nthey don't make any attempt to\nunderstand it, which is essential\nin physics. I am very glad that\nthe School Certificate practical\nexam is over. It was an awful\nheadache borrowing the apparatus and putting it together.\nOn Saturday we are having a VSO party to celebrate Jean's birthday. This is to counteract\nthe effect of the missionaries and\nother expatriates who are all very\n\"respectable.\" I don't know if\nI told you about our visit to a Nigerian night club where we\ndrank lots of Nigerian beer and\ntried dancing the \" high life\" for\nthe first time. Holiday\nStraight after Christmas, Jean\nand I flew to Ghana, where we\nhad a wonderful holiday. Ghana\nis a beautiful country with a tremendous variety of scenery,\nranging from dense tropical\nforest in the south to semi-desert\nin the north. We were able to\ntravel right to the border with\nUpper Volta northwards, and as\nfar as Taki\ncoast is 1\nc with fish ii palms ar\nused\nnor*'\nci'\nAll \u2022\nli westwards. The\n\u2014tropical beaches\nlge s and coconut\na st les \u00ab hi ch were\ntra cg. The\n,int\nan^\ndust naze, d rie< up river beds\nand vultures and round mud\nhuts, and everywhere brown and\ndry.\nNigerian Men\nLast week, two girls from\nschool died from tetanus which\nthey developed after having illegal abortions. One of them\nwas a girl I taught. It was very\nupsetting. Although they are\nolder than girls at home, they are\nmuch less wc 'v and Nigerian\nmen take advantage of them.\nThey really make me sick.\nPolygamy is legal so they have\ntwo or three wives and \" girl-friends\" as well. Also its the\naccepted thing that if a girl\nwants to get on in her job, she\nhas to be prepared to sleep with\nthe appropriate man. I don't suppose those two girls were completely blameless, but when I think what happened to them, it\nreally makes me furious.\nEveryone says that it is much\ncooler when the rains come as\nthey ought to do fairly soon\u2014\nwe've had one or two good\nstorms in the last few weeks.\nI'm writing this at Jos in\nNorthern Nigeria. We are on\nholiday from school and Judy\nand myself decided to visit the\nNorth. We left Lagos last Monday and travelled seven hundred miles by train to Kano.\nFrom Kano we got a lift to\nZaria. On Fridays all the Muslems gather at the mosque to\npray, so we went to see them.'\nOne old Muslein offered to divorce one of his three wives and\nmarry me. He even said he'd give me a dowry !\nJudy and I flew down from\nKaduna the day after a plane\nhad been hi-jacked by the East.\nWe didn't know about it at the\ntime, but wondered why there\nwere so many soldiers at Kaduna\nand Lagos airports.\nMoods\n' dare say you know that Nig is in a state of emergency.\nI think the next step will be\nOjukwu's reaction. If he decides\nto secede as now seems* probable,\nthere could well be civil war. I hope to be coming home exactly\nnine weeks today. 1 shall be flying back on a BOAC VC10\nwhich should be quite an experience. It's remarkable how one's moods change. Only a week or\ntwo ago, I was beginning to feel\nquite attached to Nigeria, and\nthinking how sorry I should be\nto leave, whereas now, eight\nweeks seems like eternity.\nI 've been very busy at school\nlately, working out a new maths\nsyllabus, preparing a list of physics apparatus we need and making further arrangements for our\nScience Day.\nBombs\nI did write to you a week ago,\nbut thought better of posting the\nletter. Lagos was very tense, and\nI was rather frightened, so it was\nan awful letter.\nYesterday I gave a tea party\n(pop and biscuits) for my class\u2014\nthere are sixteen of them. I enjoyed it very much, and I think\nthey did. We played Beatles\"\nrecords and they looked at all my\nphotos of mum, dad, etc.\nYou may have heard we had\n\u2022 another bomb in Yuba last Wednesday. There was another one\nelsewhere in Lagos, but fortunately it didn't go off properly.\nThe one in Yuba was about\nthree-quarters of a mile away\nfrom us and made the house\nshake. The explosives were in 3\npetrol tanker outside a cinema\nand quite a lot of people were\nkilled\u2014rather more than the official figure of three.\nI received my ticket home yes-ter day.
