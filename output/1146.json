    "content": "10\n^\nT*\"*^ Opinion 24 May 1999\nWhat would Legalisation Lead to?\nAttitudes towards drugs are as diverse as the people who hold them. In the first of a two part feature, Felix examines the\nattitudes and arguments for and against the legal is ation of drugs. This week Andrew Vivian explains his view that cannabis\nshould be used for medical applications under strict regulation, whilst remaining commercially illegal.\nFollowing the respectable comments proposed by\nMr 'Anonymous' (coward) last term and in the aftermath of the recent pro-legal is ation march I feel\nthat it is time to present arguments against the legal-is ation of cannabis.\nMay I first utterly refute the claim made by\nHoward Marks published in last week's article that\ntwo thirds of all under 25s take cannabis. Perhaps\nhe assumed that the statistics of his\nfriends and colleagues were\napplicable to the British youth as a whole...\nAs I see it the main problem\nwith legal ising cannabis is that it\nwould unequivocally lead to an\nincrease in all drug usage. Commercial marketing through widespread advertising would increase\nthe awareness and availability of all\ndrugs (not just cannabis) to the\nentire populace. Attracted to the\nrelative safety of cannabis new smokers would\narise, most of whom would no doubt enjoy the\nexperience; some of these new arrivals would\nbranch out into other forms of drug use in search\nof different in duc i ble experiences. Kids who get a kick out of breaking rules or through trying to\nimpress others will use harder drugs if cannabis is\nlegal is ed and loses its coolness or even 'hard' symbolism (lets be honest, - this is how some of you\nstarted smoking in the first place).\nSure, some kids are already on hard\ndrugs but numbers would\nrise. The last two points\nare basically the results\nof different forms of\npeer pressure. A tiny\nminority may crave\nnew challenges\nand even hold that\nif the government\nrelents on^ cannabis then\nthey can get away with more\nmoderate crimes (I'm not suggesting anyone at IC would\nbe stupid enough to think\nthat though!); imagine if the\ngovernment were actually to\ngive in - a whole new generation of protesters would\n\\ emerge pressing for slack-\\ ness on other issues -just how far would this\n\"Commercial market\ning through widespread advertising\nwould increase the\nawareness and avail\nability of all drugs...\"\n\"Keep cannabis\ncommercially\nillegal, although\nexploit any\nmedicinal benefit\nit may have...\"\ngo? (c.f. suing actions in the USA)\ntet us consider the scenario where drug usage\nincreased but knock on effects\nwere themselves insignificant.\nWhat grounds are there for\nopposing increased drug\nusage - surely it is the individual's choice if they partake?\nWell, actually\nthat's not the\ncase. You're\nforgetting the\nnon-smokers.\nThe users are content but the nonusers lose, subject to the behaviour, influence and smoke released\nby the smokers. Some of you may\nrecall the letter I submitted last\nterm requesting at least a small area of the\nunion to be\ndesignated non-smoking. My\nthanks to the Union officials\nwho didn't even bother to\nreply.... bastards. Our Union is\na classic example of non-s mok ers being subjected to the whim\nof those who smoke. Legalising\ncannabis and increasing drug availability will increase the already high\nnumber of such sit-u at ions, not good for\nthe non-smoker who quite\nrightfully wants to have a social life without unnecessary\nhealth hazards. Not only that, but\ndrug usage isn't exactly aesthetically pleasing. While being boxed\nin behind a smoker around Ihc\npavements of Piccadilly with no\nway of avoiding the smoke 'catch-ment area' may drive me positively\nlivid, the sight of cigarette butts\neverywhere is horrible, especially in areas of otherwise natural or indeed artificial beauty. These circumstances should be actively reduced and not\nencouraged by promoting further drug use through\ncannabis legal is ation. You may argue on this account thai I would\nhave to concede that tobacco and alcohol should\nalso be illegal. Well In the case of tobacco I agree\nwhole-hearted ly, as for alcohol it is less rational\n(and I'm not saying that in bias -1 hate the taste of\nalcohol and very rarely drink) even though it has its\n\"...ask yourself why the\nlegality of a drug should\nactually bother you if you\ncan easily get hold of that\ndrug anyway?\"\nfair share of related damage to innocent citizens\n(drink-driving). The issue is that the consequences\nof cannabis can be foreseen\nwhereas for tobacco they were\nnot (and in the ignorant 60s tobacco was even regarded as\ngood for your health).\nSolutions? Keep cannabis\ncommercially illegal, although\nexploit any medicinal benefit it\nmay have in controlled medical\nestablishments. Quite frankly\nthough, I would be happy for\nyou to smoke whatever the hell you want in your\nhomes if you consented to never doing so in\npublic - and then strictly adhered to such\n*wa compensation.\nYou may still completely disagree with\nwhat I have said, but then ask yourself why\nthe legality of a drug should actually bother\nyou if you can easily get hold of that drug\n' anyway? Cannabis is not high on\nthe police's agenda as the blatant\nusage during the pro-legal is ation march proved, and I can only think\nlh at if any of you are still for legal is ation then you must c it her be selfish or have business propositions...\nThe highs and lows of cannabis: Above, protesters at\nthe Mayday march In good spirits. Below, the\nsoporific effects of over-indulgence\nNext week Danny Kushlick, spokesman for Transform, a pressure group who believes that current British\ndrug laws should be re-examined, presents arguments for the legal is ation of most, if not all, drugs.\n\n"

Coldplay, an up and coming Indie\nband, are headlining the event; their\nfirst single received critical acclaim\nfrom much of the music press, and\nthey recently supported Catatonia for\nRadio 1. All the band members are\nLondon students and this will be the\nfirst gig they play after completing\ntheir finals. Two more student bands,\nThe Fantastic Super Foofs and Hal and\nRoger, are supporting.\nXFM are sponsoring the event,\nwith DJ John Kennedy playing a set.\nThe evening will finish off with sets\nfrom student Djs until closing at 2am. Tickets will cost \u00a33 for students in\nadvance (ULU ticket line01716642030), or \u00a34 on the door (non-students\n\u00a35/\u00a36).\nThe event is being held to publicise and raise money for London\nNightline, a telephone helpline run by\nstudents for students. Nightline offers\na confidential listening and practical\nInformation service from 6pm to 8am every night of term. It has been running for 28 years, originally starting in\nresponse to a number of student suicides here at Imperial. Covering 31\ninstitutions across London, Nightline\nprovides a service for 150,000 students.\nFor further information about the\nband night or about London Nightline\ncall 01 71 636 71 95 or email coord in a tor@nightline.free serve. co.uk\n24 May 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nFilms Editor: David Roberts\nNews Editor.- Andy Oforl\nMusic Editors: Dennis Patrickson\n& Jason Ramanathan\nGames Editor: Gary Smith\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nClubscene: Giles Morrison,\nGurminder Marwaha & Joel Lewis\nWant to Join an LT Hunt? Behind the Pay Dispute\nLast Monday was a special day for anybody with any sort of\ninterest in \"aliens\", it was the inauguration\nof SETI@home (\"SETI = Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence\"). The ambitious project Involves thousands of volunteers\ndownloading, installing and running a screen saver that processes a chunk of\ndata from the massive Arecibo telescope\nin Puerto Rico, the largest radio telescope in the world. SETI@home will run\nfor a period of two years, analysing a section of the sky. Scientists and engineers\nattached to SERENDIP - Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby\nDeveloped Populations - have pioneered\nthis project based on their belief that\nthe best chance we have of discovering\nlifeforms on other planets lies in the\nanalysis of radio signals; as the website\nfor the project proclaims, \"there's a small\nbut captivating possibility that your computer will detect the faint murmur of a civilization beyond Earth\".\nThe program has been designed to\nrun as a screen saver in order to ensure\nthat it does not eat into volunteer users'\n\"work time\" (it is also available as an ordinary program with no graphics that computes all the time), and runs on PCs,\nMacs and various other formats. For security, the server from which the screen-saver can be downloaded has been kept\nseparate from the data server, which\ndoes not feed out any executable code,\nmoreover, the software can be set to\nrequest permission from the user before\nposting the results of any tests; the results\ncan also be sent automatically the next\ntime the user is online. Enough data can\nbe downloaded via a28.8k connection in\nfive minutes to keep the average PC\nbusy for a few days. The screen saver itself displays a three-By Suilll Rao dimensional graphical display portraying\na chart of the signal; participants also\nhave the opportunity to view a map displaying the area of sky being analysed at\nthe time.\nThe data recorded from the Arecibo\nObservatory telescope is essentially\nplaced onto 35 gigabyte tapes daily- these\ntapes are then mailed all the way to\nBerkeley where they are split into downloadable chunks about a quarter of a megabyte each in size. Fundamentally,\nthe project involves a search for strong\nsing als in a narrow band, and will analyse\nsignals an order of magnitude weaker\nthan any previously done. Measures are\nin place to detect deliberate forgeries\nand any \"positive\" results noted will be\nchecked back at Berkeley, though, of\ncourse, the user on whose system any\ndiscovery is made will be credited as a co-discoverer.\nThose working on the project hope\nthat by the time SETI@home has run its\ncourse, better approaches and newer\ntelescopes will have been made avail-able. As Louis Friedman of the Planetary\nSociety says, this is the first time ever in\nthe history of the human race that the\nopportunity has been made available for\nanybody anywhere in the world to join\n\"the scientific search for intelligent beings\nelsewhere in our universe\". Many might\nbe sceptical but as Dan Wertheimer, Chief\nScientist for the project puts it, \"you can\nargue all day, but unless you do the\nsearch, you will never know\".\nThe SETIOhome home page is at\nhttp://seti at home. ssl.berkeley.edu/, while\nthe paper from 1997 announcing the\nproject can be found at http://seti a th ome.ssl.berkeley.edu/woody_ paper. html.\nThe reasons for\ntomorrow's strike\nstretch back to a pay\ndispute that has been ongoing for several months, and were outlined in last\nweek's issue of Felix. In a letter to David\nHellard Ms Barker explained \"the aim of\nthis action is to persuade the employers\nto improve their offer of a3.5% salary\nincrease.\" According to AUT p tess releases, average earnings in Britain have\nincreased 40% in real terms (i.e. above\ninflation) in the past eighteen years,\nwhile academics have only seen a3.1% increase. In contrast, vice-chancellors'\nhave seen their pay increase by 7% a year for the past three years.\nAnothet issue of importance to\nImperial AUT members is London weight-ing, a system that attempts to compensate London academics for increased\nliving costs in the capital. There has been\nno increase in this figure since 1992. Ms\nBarker voiced London academics' con-cern s; \"we are angry that the employers\nrefuse even to discuss this element of\nour pay claim.\"\nA third sword in the AUT's attack\nconcerns the amounts examiners are\npaid. According to a news release dated\n29 April, over 17% of external examiners\nare paid less than \u00a33.60 an hour, a figure which prompted David Triesman,\nthe AUT's General Secretary, to comment \"you can get more for responding\nto the words 'Big Mac and French Fries'\nthan to the words of a learned science\nPhD.\"\nThe decision facing students is\nwhether to support the strike by staying\nat home, and thus risk penal is ation from\ncollege for missed exams or deadlines,\nor to pass the picket lines and come\ninto college. David Hellard has said that\nthe union will be\nBy Ed Sexton open, and will publicise the strike as and\nwhen necessary. He also offered moral\nsupport to the AUT, thinking \"they've\ngot a just reason [for striking]... they\naren't getting paid enough.\" Ms Barker\nurged students and ICU to do more,\nhowever; \"I would hope that Dave could\ngive more active support... we would\nwelcome the support of ICU\".\nClearly most students are unlikely\nto support the strike by boycotting\nexams. Ms Barker appealed to those students to \"look at the bigger picture\",\nsuggesting that the quality of future stu-dents' education could suffer if the pay\ndispute was not resolved. Given that further action is planned for the next academic year she may well be right, but\nwhether or not that means students\nshould actively support the strikers is a difficult question, and one each student\nwill have to answer for him or herself\nImperial College Union's Annual General\nMeeting\nwill take place on\nFriday 28 May at 1 pm In the\nUnion Dining Hall.\nALL students are welcome\nand encouraged to attend.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at MCP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16 -16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

    "content": "20 Sport & Crossword 24 May 1999\nOn a pitch far, far away (well, just next to\nHeathrow in fact), 3 weeks ago, the IC\ncricket team began the second consecutive defence of the ULU Cricket Cup.\nAnd what a good start they made. Three\nwins out of three in the preliminary group\nstages, sees IC cruising into the quarter\nfinals for a home tie against either Royal\nHolloway or LSE.\nImperial's defence of the title they\nhave won the past two years began with\na game against St. Georges. All the ULU\nmatches are 40 over limited over affairs,\nbut all of IC's matches so far have been\naffected by rain. IC batted first against\nSt George's and made an impressive 230\nfor 5 off 35 overs, Jawwad Rasheed\n(Mech Eng I) hitting 118 not out. There\nwas more rain and St Georges couldn't cope with their new target, finishing on\n109 for 9, ULU captain Simon Holliday\nscoring a half century and Kav Patel taking 3 for 33.\nIC capt ili sed on this opening victory\nthe next week, by thrashing GKT 2nds. IC\nmade a massive 252 for 3, again off 35\nCRICKET-1st XI\nThe Story So Far...\nby Gus Paul\novers. Jawwad, who has obviously been\nwatching Brian Lara's recent form, hit\nthe GKT attack to all parts in scoring 168\n- at one point scoring 106 out of a partnership of 108 with Alex Wright. A shell-shocked GKT couldn't even come close\nto IC's total, being s kitt led out for just 76,\nKav taking 3 for 29.\nThe third game was a much closer\nmatchup against St. Bart's. The winners\nwould guarantee a home tie in the QuarterFinals, and both teams were confident of victory. A beautiful afternoon at\nHarlington saw IC win the toss and score\n191/9 off their 40 overs, against a Bart's team containing only 10 fielders (they\nhad forgotten to bring an umpire with\nthem so were forced to use a fielder as\nsquare leg umpire). Jawwad couldn't continue his form, but he still joint top\nscored with 32, sharing a62 run partnership with Murali (also 32). Last wicket\npair Nigel Terry and Mark Dawkins scored\n15 runs off the final over, which was to\nprove crucial later on. After the tea interval the players returned to a backdrop of\nblack clouds and lightning bolts, and the\numpire was unwilling to begin in the\npotential hazardous conditions. After\nan hours break, the players returned to\na soggier field, Bart's requiring 72 off 15\novers. They complained about IC\nbowlers bowling more than 8 overs each,\nbut were rebuffed when the tu les were\nproduced. They proceeded to spend\ntheir innings whining on the boundary,\nwhile a very tense match was unfolding\nin the dim light out in the middle. The\nmedics lost their first 4 wickets cheaply\nand were never able to get back ahead\nof the run rate, although 16 extras conceded by IC allowed them to reach 69 for\n5 off their 15 overs, meaning IC won by\njust 2 runs. Kav bowled unchanged from\nthe motorway end and captured 2 for 30,\ntaking his season's wicket tally to 8.\nSo IC proceed to the Quarter Finals,\nand hope to go one better than the last\nwinning IC team from 1971/72, who\ncould not manage to capture the cup\nthree years on the trot It looks to be an\nexciting summer ahead.\nSCOREBOARD\nCRICKET\n1st XI\nIC 230/5 (Rasheed 119*) v St. Georges\n109/9 (K Patel 3-29)\nIC won by 121 runs\nIC 252/3 (Rasheed 168) v GKT 76 (Patel\n3-33)\nIC won by 176 runs\nIC 191/9 v St. Bart's69/5( chasing 72 off\n15)\nIC won by 2 runs\n2nd XI\nAt this point I would have put in some\n2nd XI scores, but I forgot to write them\ndown.

In this case, that image is imposed\nonto Nivola and Witherspoon, as the\nboyfriend/girlfriend duo who come up\nwith an incredibly contrived plan to raise\nthe money which will pay off Nivola's debts to a local gangster. Having persuaded Witherspoon (who, worrying ly, looks 17 despite being 23) to seduce\nBrolin in order to rob his house, the plan\ngoes pear-shaped when Brolin goes mental and locks her up in the basement.\nCue much swearing, anguish and, of\ncourse, blind panic.\nGeneric it may be, but thanks to a constantly swirling plot and appealing acting from the leads, it's an engaging tale.\nSadly the ending fails to surprise, despite\ntrying hard to confound your expectations, yet the plot as a whole is far enough\nAmerica, where all the streets are paved with gold..\nremoved from anything else you'll have\nseen to keep you engrossed from start to\nfinish - despite being an essentially moral-it y free zone. Moreover, the movie's success in the US will undoubtedly pave the\nway to future stardom for the leads - particularly Witherspoon, who, with three\nmore movies due this year, has been\npicked out as one of the faces of 1999.\nSacrificing genuine originality and\ndepth for style and appeal, Best Laid Plans\nis nonetheless a decent and entertaining\n- albeit downbeat - movie. D Dave\nWin tickets to She's All That with the\nKENSINGTON\nThis week's competition centres around\nupcoming indie comedy She's All That.\nStarring unknowns (Freddie Prinze Jr,\nRachael Leigh Cook) in the lead roles,\nalongside a few bigger names (Mathew\nLillard, Anna Paquin), it promises to be\nentertaining - if not entirely original.\nIf you'd like to see it courtesy of those\nlovely people at the Odeon Kensington,\njust answer the following question:\nWhich vampire hunting actress\nmakes cameo appearances In both\nShe's All That and Scream 2 ?\nJust email your answer to fl lm. felix\n@lc.ac.uk before Wednesday evening.\nThe first ten names out of the virtual hat\nwill win a pair of tickets.\nm\\ As ever, a packed mail bag was the\nresponse to last week's competition,\nwith almost every one a correct answer\n- spotting that Best Laid Plans star\nAlessandro Nivola appeared alongside\nNicholas Cage and John Travolta in John\nWoo's Face/Off. The first five names out\nof the hat were:\nJanice Lonsdale\nNarlsara Intrachandra\nBeatrice Dereume\nRichard Powell\nCllve Parker\nYou've each earned a pair of tickets to see\nBest Laid Plans for your trouble - please\ndrop into the Felix office (in the corner of\nBeit Quad) ASAP.\nSOU\nRACKS\nThe waterboy\nThis surprise US box office hit comedy\nfeatures Adam Sandler playing Bobby\nBoucher, a lowly water boy for his\nlocal university football team.\nAlthough he's a bit 'slow', BB thinks\nthat the dispensing of the halftime\nwater is the greatest thing he's ever\ndone. However, a series of blunders\ncosts him his job and so the scene is\nset for BB to take his local town by\nstorm.\nNot content with being a Hollywood star, Sandler is also a recording\nartist in his own right and has sold\nwell over 31.5 million albums. He also\nunderstands how important a soundtrack is to a film and The Watcrboy\nsoundtrack is no different, featuring a remarkable mix of rock classics by ELO,\nJohn Mellencamp, Lenny Kravitz, Rush\nand the Doors with more contemporary artists such as Goldfinger, Candlebox and The Candyskins. The CD is\nout now.\nBlast From\nThe Past\nEclectic or eccentric would be the nice\nway to describe this one; uninspired\nwould be the less kind way. Mixing\nREM, Randy Newman, Perry Como and\nUS 'Alternative' bands (with such 'hilarious' names as Squirrel Nut Zippers,\nCherry Poppin' Dadies and Dishwalla).\nSomehow, it ultimately blends\ntogether surprisingly well (in a cheesy,\nhappy kinda way) but nonetheless it's definitely not the kind of thing you're\nlikely to want to buy.\nAt First Sight\nComposer Mark Isham is best known\nfor writing jazzy scores and for his\nproficiency on the jazz trumpet, and\nconsequently it's hardly surprising that\nhe stirs a lot of jazzy piano-tinkling\ninto the unashamedly soppy score for\nthis Val Kilmer/Mira Sorvino star rer. Drifting between gentle musing\nand haunting restraint, it's designed to\naccompany a candlelit dinner, rather\nthan a lengthy Quake session, and\nmixes seven original songs with some\nclassic Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Pleasant enough if you like\nthat kind of thing...\nGurm & Janine\n\n"

Akuji strikes a deal which\nwould allow him to exit the underworld\nand sort out Orad good and proper -unfortunately this deal is a bit on the\nharsh side - well who said getting out of\nhell was easy.\nGood Graphics:\nMakes Lara look dowdy and tatty. Akuji\nwalks, jumps, slashes his way through\nhis high detailed hell. The lighting effects\nalone are impressive and the monsters\nlook very polygon like, they move fairly\nquickly though.\nSeraphim Sounds:\nVoodoo\nstyled music,\nthe odd\nwhoosh of\nmagic,\nbuzzing of\nmonsters in\nthe area.\nNothing too\nimpressive\nand definately nothing out of\nthe ordinary.\nGreat Gameplay:\nLara had her two pistols up front and personal to take out the bad guys. Akuji\ninstead prefers to go for it claw against\nclaw, and has a rather sharp shaving\nblade strapped on the end of his mittens.\nNow while this seems a good idea for\ntaking on the local cats and dogs the\naverage hell hound comes with sharper\nteeth. The solution - voodoo magic.\nThere is more magic down in the hell\nworld than a million Paul Daniels and\nDavid Copperfields and most of it pretty\neffective at stopping monsters chomping\non your cheeks. The con to l method is\ngood - with a neat sniper mode for those\nlong range precision spells. Fourteen\nlevels will also keep the interest up. If you\nare expecting lots of puzzles this isn't really it, more a Tomb Raider 2 than 1.\nSex and Violence:\nWell violence anyway, with Freddy Kruger\ngloves, the ability to morph into a panther and a wide range of fire, blast and\nblood drain in^.| i. It. i: plenty of vio-nr ~\" Best bit:\nMorhing into a panther is pretty\ncool, so are some\nof the nastier\nspells - the poses-sion spell allows\nAkuji to take over\n\u2022 the enemies\nbody and rattle\nthem till they explode. Scanners eat your\nheart out - or on second thoughts.\nWorst Bit:\nNothing really stands out. The monsters\ncan look a little bit mechanical especially when compared against Akuji's detail and the backgrounds.\nSo Who will get it: 3 D Third person action adventurers who\nbelieve that Gex and Mario are\nfor the kids - Ok the Lara Croft\ncrowd. Anyone who wants a decent adult themed 3D plat-former.\nBut Is It better than Gex 3 :\nIt hasn't got the little irritating\nproblems that just knock the\nedge off Gex so yes.\n\n"

Oh good grief, I hear you cry, where the\nhell is he this week? Pray let me explain. Every year at the beginning of\nMay, a series of conveniently-placed\npublic holidays gives rise to the phe-nomen on of Golden Week during\nwhich the worker bees of corporate\nJapan down tools and decamp en\nmasse for sunnier climes for a well-earned spell of R&R. This little drone\nbeing no exception, I decided to take\nthis opportunity to head off to Japan's most southerly province to escape\nfrom the constant shuttlecock and bat-tle dore of life on the mainland. I must\nadmit to having an ulterior motive - my\ngirlfriend (it might surprise you to learn\nthat even I have one) comes from\nNago in northern Okinawa, and as\nsuch I could kill two birds with one\nstone and see her and have a holiday\non the cheap at the same time.\nOkinawa - in reality a collection of\nseveral little islands which takes its\nname from the largest of the group -is the smallest, and some would say\nmost spectacular, of the jewels in\nJapan's geographical\ncrown. Its southerly\nlocation - closer to\nTaiwan than Tokyo - be nOt CHOU S thrOUgh ensures that it is also\nthe warmest and OUt the human WOrld this fact is reflected\nfor being bland and\nBridge to Wales was\nbad). Whilst Okinawans\nare now no longer foreigners in their own country, there\nwas another difficulty associated with\nbeing reunited with the mother country Those of you who have been Stateside cannot have\n\" . . . British food might ving\nin the distinctive\nnature of its flora\nand fauna. The\nmain island is only a shade over 60 miles\nfrom end to end, and is divided in\nalmost equal part\nbetween a grey, forbidding US military\nbase and lush, mountainous forest\ninhabited by centipedes the size of\ncats. Actually that's a bit of an exaggeration - the Marines life is not quite\nas extensive as all that and the creepy-crawlies are really only as big as a large kitten at most. However, there\nis no escaping the American military\npresence, a legacy of WWII when Okinawa was the only part of Japan\ninvaded by the Allied forces prior to\nthe post-1945 US occupation of the\nmainland. In fact, up until its return to\nJapan in 1972, Okinawa was under the\ngovernment of the States, and the\nlocals actually needed passports to go\nto the mainland (and you thought having to pay to go across the Severn\nfailed to notice\nthat in direct contravention of all\nknown conventions of decency\nand common sense, the Americans will insist on\ndriving their cars\non the right hand\nside of the road.\nBy contrast the\nJapanese, in common with the rest of\nthe civilised world drive on the left,\nand thus when Okinawa - until then\nthe de facto 51st state of the Unionreturned to the fold, the local population in the inimitable words of Charlton Heston \"had themselves a situation\". But in a gargantuan feat of\norganisation, only outdone by the\nefforts of the Apollo programme, the\nentire population of the island\nswitched from driving on the right to\ndriving on the left\novernight. Anywhere else such a dramatic realignment would have\nbeen unthinkable,\nbut in Japan cooper-unpalatable, but the at ive activity on this\nscale passes off\ninsect kingdom clearly without a hitch. In\nfact I sometimes get\nbegS tO differ...\" the feeling that it\nwould be easier to\nget the entire population of 125 million to pick a single set of Lottery numbers than it would to get two\nWesterners to agree on which pub to\ngo to on Friday night.\nBut there's a lot more to the place\nthan Gl Joe and astounding feats of\nconsensual motoring. There's insects\nfor a start. Lots of them. Mosquitoes\nin particular. There was I, being\nwowed by fabulous scenery, getting\nmy ears back on local delicacies in\ncharming little roadside restaurants or\nmarvelling at seas so clear and blue\nthat they looked like a kindergarten\nkid's painting of \"what I did on my\nholidays\", and all the time I was slapping at swarms of the little perish ers as they homed in on every square\n\"...Okinawa was the\nonly part of Japan\ninvaded by the Allied\nforces prior to the post-1945 US occupation of\nthe mainland...\"\ninch of uncovered skin.\nMatt Salter until I sounded like the\nrhythm track off a Snoop\nDoggy Dog song. They didn't seem to\nbother the locals who wandered about\ntotally un molested, but as soon as I set\nfoot outside the car a cloud of winged\nsyringes made a beeline (or should\nthat be a mos-quito-line) for my\npasty white flesh\nlike something out\nof \"633 Squadron\".\nMaybe they saw\nme as a chance to\nget a bit of variety\nin their diet I don't know, but whatever the reason\nthey were impossible to ignore. British\nfood might be notorious throughout\nthe human world for being bland and\nunpalatable, but the insect kingdom\nclearly begs to differ.\nThis profusion of (sometimes\nunwelcome) wildlife comes about as a direct result of Okinawa being situated in the sub-tropics and, whilst this\ncan lead to occasional bouts of temporary anaemia, it also makes for\nscenery which is\nreally something to\nbehold. Driving\naround the coastal\nroads (on the left of\ncourse) I was struck\nby the sheer variety\nand lushness of the\ngreenery that seems\nto overwhelm every\nspare patch of countryside. It wasn't just\nthat there was a heck of a lot of it\nthat surprised me, it\nwas that pretty much all of it were\ntotally new to me. There were spiky\nplants and twisty plants, plants with\nhuge, broad leaves that looked like\nthey had grown upside-down, and\ntrees that resembled 30-foot tall broccoli florets covered with thick creepers\nthat would have had Tarzan of the\nApes nodding with approval. It was a bit like being on the set of Jurassic\nPark. At one point, looking out over\nthe wide expanses of verdant forest\nfrom my vantage point of a mountaintop cafe that was accessible only via\nlong winding roads the width of a human hair, I was struck anew by the\nunbelievable density and variety of\nthe vegetation which, I felt sure, must\nconceal an army of majorly gigantic\n\" . . . the local brew which, as far as I could make out, consists of2 parts lighter fuel to1 part pink paraffin diluted with mineral water...\" spiders.\nIts not just the inedible foliage\nthat is different over there. On another occasion, whilst driving across\ncountry I asked my girlfriend - who\nhad bravely opted for what my father\nused to call the \"suicide seat\" - what all\nthe odd-looking bushes growing in\nthe fields were. \"Pineapples\" she\nreplied, faintly irritated that anyone\ncould ask such a stupid question. I think the next field contained a crop\nof mangos, but I wasn't about to open\nmy mouth and run the risk of looking\neven more of a be rk. What goes for\nthe fruit goes double for the fish and\nseafood. One afternoon we went to\na friend's house for a barbecue the\nstar attraction at which, apart from\nheroic quantities of succulent Pacific\ncrab, was a bewildering array of tropical fish caught fresh off the reef that\nvery morning. They weren't your usual\ncod, haddock and skate, these wet ep uk ka \"Jacques Cousteau's Amazing\nWorld of the Deep\" fish complete with\npeculiar fins and long wispy feelers,\nand colours so bright and vibrant that\nthey looked for all the world like they\nhad been caught up in an explosion in\na paint factory. Some of the less lurid\namongst their number were wrapped in\nfoil and slapped\nstraight on the grill\nwhilst the rest were\ncut up there and\nthen, marinated perfunctorily in soy\nsauce and lemon\njuice, and eaten raw\nwashed down with\nlarge glasses of the\nlocal brew which, as\nfar as I could make\nout, consists of 2\nparts lighter fuel to 1 part pink paraffin diluted with mineral water. I now\nknow what really fresh fish tastes like\nand it ain't Harry Ramsden's. During our al fresco feast one of\nour party proudly informed me that\nOkinawa boasts the largest number\nof centi gen arians per head in the\nwhole of Japan and after what I'd seen, smelled and tasted in my all too\nbrief visit I would have though that 100\nyears was probably too short a time to\nspend in this place. I 've already\nbooked my next trip when I shall come armed with twice as many\nrolls of film as this time, my swimming trunks and a fishing rod. And an\nindustrially-sized tube of mosquito\nrepellent.\n\n"

    "content": "24 May 1999 Sport 19\nKENDO\nNew comer Imperial takes gold\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with\nKendo (and that, I should think, would be\nmost of you), it is a Japanese martial art\ntype sport fought between two people\nusing bamboo swords. It has gained\npopularity in Europe over the past few\nyears and the ICU Kendo club was\nfounded this March, thanks to much\nrunning around by Koichiro Yoshida and\nhis dedicated committee. Around 40\nmembers (which is amazing considering\nhow new the club is!) are currently training every Wednesday and Friday from\n8.30pm to 10.00pm at Southside Gym.\nSo, what results can an only-just-founded-club bring near the end of the academic\nyear? On Saturday 1st May, the Annual\nUniversity 'Taikai\" (Championships) were\nheld at Cheltenham & Gloucester College\nand both individual and team competitions were fought throughout the day.\nThis year, seven universities (IC, UCL,\nOxford, Cambridge, Sheffield, Kent and\nCheltenham & Gloucester) took part.\nWhile the other colleges arrived on their\nminibuses on big teams, it was Koichiro\nYoshida from Imperial who, having got\nup at 5.00am and travelled for 3 hours\nfrom Victoria on coach, won the Championship title with an outstanding per-form ance. He also contributed in\nbringing the Silver medal to the Imperial-Cheltenham & Gloucester combined\nteam.\nIt was such a shame we couldn't stay for\nthe buffet afterwards since we had to\ncatch the last coach back to London\nwhich surely would have been gone had\nwe been another 30 seconds late. Hopefully, next year, we'll have one, if not\nmore, teams of our own and make the\nbuffet as well as winning the medals\nand trophies!\nWith one of, if not the best university\nkendo player in as founder and president\nof the club, the ICU Kendo Club is sure\nto flourish and continue to be successful in the years to come. If you are interested in joining us, contact HYPERLINK\nmailto:koichiro.yoshida@ic.ac.uk\nkoichiro.yoshida@ic.ac.uk or come along\nto one of our training sessions. We\nhope to see more of you next year!\nA couple of weeks ago a report was\nsubmitted about a pool tournament\nbetween Southside and the Union. Surprisingly I do have standards for what\ngets into the Sports pages, and while\nthey are quite low, this article didn't reach the minimum. Suffice to say that\nSouthside won 9 - 6 .\nFrom the Sidelines\nSo Manchester United have won the\nPremiership and are one third of the\nway to fulfilling my prediction of their\ntreble chances (Felix 1143). By the time\nyou read this of course the outcome of\nthe FA Cup final will be known (my prediction was Newcastle to win in extra\ntime) and the build up will have begun\nto the European Cup Final on Wednesday evening in Barcelona (I have Man United winning that one). Before any\nof you think it, I am not a Man U fan\n(even though I was born in London,\nwhich seems to be where most of their\nfans come from), but I think we should\ntake a moment to step back and look\nat how well Alex Ferguson has done\nwith his teams. In the 7 year history of\nthe Premiership, Man U have won the\nleague 5 times out of 7. They have an\nunending supply of youthful, British, talent and one of the best managers in\nthe game for the next 5 years. However\nmuch you love or hate the team, you\nhave to respect the ability to keep\nchurning out the quality players. Contrast this with the fortunes of one of the\nother two teams to win the Premiership,\nBlackburn Rovers, who will being enduring 1st division football next season.\nBut while all this football is going on,\n\"even though the season has ended,\ndon't forget there is a World Cup on in\nthis country at the moment. Yes that's right, it's my weekly plug for the cricket\nworld cup. It so far is looking to be a good tournament with England winning their games against Sri Lanka and\nKenya, and I was at the Oval on Saturday to watch them take on South Africa\n(hopefully they won).\nThe ticketing system under which I obtained those tickets, however, is\nrather odd, in that I had to submit my\nrequest for them over a year before the\nstart of the tournament. Last year's football world cup in France was an\nevent selling a much greater number of\ntickets to a much bigger world-wide\naudience, and the tickets for that didn't have to be ordered a year in advance.\nAlso this is the last world cup in this\ncountry for a generation. You would\nhave thought the England and Wales\nCricket Board would be shouting about\nit from the rooftops, but I have yet to\nsee a single TV advert (other than the\nones for Sky). Still a much larger number of people seem to know about it\nthan I expected, and the arguments\nover what should be on the tele in my\nhall look set to continue for the next\ncouple of weeks at least.\nAnyone purchasing a Summer Ball Ticket will now be entered into a weekly draw, where the\nfollowing fabulous prizes could be yours:\n\u2022 14\" Colour Television (Courtesy of ICU Catering)\n\u2022 Two Person Tent (Courtesy of the YHA store)\n\u2022 Dinner for Two at Luigi Malone's( Courtesy of Luigi Malone's) \u2022 Your money back on the cost of Two Tickets $\niCU\nIMI'IKIAI.COI.lin i MiNK IK\nFree Suit Hire (Courtesy of Youngs Suit Hire) * TV YA V HRA Free Haircut (Courtesy of Anne Russell Hair) ^ p/v LA CF^ The sooner you get your Ticket the MORE YOU CAN WIN!\nTicket deadline Monday 7th June All students \u00a355 (Subject to proof)\n\n"

Benefiting from university education requires having a good\nworking relationship between students\nand academic staff, and that means that\nboth groups should show some interest\nin the other's problems.\nPatronising comment aside, what I am trying to say is that you can't ignore\nthe AUT strike. Listen to the arguments\nand opinions, and make up your own\nmind. If you decide that the AUT's action\nis justified, at least in principle, then you\nare faced with a problem; what should\nyou do tomorrow?\nWhat follows is NOT official advice,\nnor Felix editorial policy, merely my own\nview. If you do not have exams tom or row, do not come in to college.\nLectures can be caught up, and probably\nwon't happen anyway, and you can survive without the library for a day. Skip that\nlab project and watch the cricket instead.\nIf you do have exams, it's probably\na good idea to turn up - college may well\nfail students who do not turn up, and neither the AUT nor ICU may be able to fight\nsuch a ruling. Having said that, if you\nknow most of the people taking the\nexam, get together before hand and\ndecide to skip it as a group. It will be difficult to validate an exam if only 1 0 % of\nthe students turn up and, besides, college can't afford to have that many fails\nin a year - it might lose us our second\nplace in the league tables.\nIf all that sounds too militant for you,\nthen why not add a small paragraph of\nprotest to the end of your exam answer\npaper? Write a brief note to the examiner\nexplaining how you had to cross AUT\npicket lines to take the exam, and how\nyou feel it is wrong for college to go\nahead with exams on a strike day. Perhaps suggest that Colleges listen to their\nstaff's demands and respect industrial\naction.\nSuch a note will either be read by a non-striking member of London University, in which case it will remind them of\nthe action being taken, or will otherwise\neventually end up in the hands of an AUT\nmember, which will demonstrate your\nsupport.

    "content": "12 Music 24 May 1999\nAlbums\nPROLAPSE\nGhosts of Dead Aeroplanes\nMISHKA\nMishka\nIt's funny how you pick up an album\nof an unknown (or let's just say relatively low-key) band and expect to\nbe talking about how their debut album\nis going to affect the music world only\nto find out that it's actually their fourth\nalbum. Well that's the case with the six-strong Scottish Prolapse and I have no\nidea what their earlier works sound like,\nProlapse spot another Jumbo going down\nalthough I have reason to believe that\ntheir style is Stereolab-ish and The Fall.\nThe opening track of Ghosts Of\nDead Aeoplaneswasn't as loud as I was\nexpecting but a very slow, mellow,\nalmost instrumental tune. The vocals are\nstrongly accented but that's not the reason why they do not complement this\ntrack at all. just music would have been\nmuch better. Talking of accents, co-vocal-ist Linda Steelyard has a thing about\nthem,- so she likes Oasis from Manchester but hates Blur.\nAnyway, their recently released single Fob.Com Is a very catchy number.\nThe other vocalist Mick Derrick sounds a bit like Ewan McGregor on Choose Life.\nIndeed the lyrics are sung in that fashion.\nLinda's sharper vocals adds a little freshness to a melody that, perhaps, has\nalready been heard.\nThere's very little potential for future\nsingles on this album with most of the\ntracks being un-m ov lng, monotone dr i vel. But they have to release something\nso I guess they could possibly get away\nwith One Illness, which at least has a little life. They are strongly advised to\nquickly retire to performing live where\nthey can take the emphasis off their\nmusic and onto their manic stage acts of\nthe vocalists. Prolapse are reputed to\nperform astoundingly on stage.\nMusically, this album is difficult to\ncategorise. Let's just settle with soft-rock\nplus indie-pop. This isn'ta combination\nthat works for me and apart from\nFab.Com (which is a fantastic tune) there\nis nothing else on this album to make\nyou rush to the record stores. H Asad\nLAMB\nFear of Fours \u2022 ***\nFear of Fours? They're safe\nwatching England then.\nW hy Is the internet so crap? I went for a bit of a surf on the\nsubject of Lamb and ended\nup with reams and reams of rubbish\nabout how wonderful Polydor Is and\ndid I want to buy albums by Hovercraft,\nfam bk in and Bush? I really don't understand it.\nAs it turns out, Lamb are a Mancunian pair in the form of Andy Barlow and\nLouise Rhodes who specialise in the\nmellow grooves of the slowed up\ndrum'n 'bass favoured by such bands as\nthe Sneaker Pimps. Their first, self-titled\nalbum was met with much admiration by\nthose in the know and subsequently\ntheir debut single Cotton Wool was\nremixed more than once. But what of\nFear Of Fours'? What indeed.\nThe opener is a track called Soft Mistake that is anything but. It's a laid-back\ninstrumental that sets the scene for the\nmood of the whole album. That mood is\ngenerally a relaxed one although there\nare some classic jungle style e booty\ns hak in' frantic beats. That's okay, we can\nlet them slide because we've got such\ncrackers as Bonfire, Five and the current\nsingle B line. The flavour of the album\nhas a distinct Eno sound about It: In Fear\nOf Fours there's a very prominent bass\nsound that Is characteristic of Eno, as is\nthe whole theme of chilling out. If you've\nnever listened to Apollo by Brian Eno I suggest you do.\nThe only niggle I 've got is that\nalthough the tracks on Fear Of Fours\nare undoubtedly an excellent selection,\nall of them stick to approximately the\nsame formula. The intro is a swirly mix of\nstrings, angelic vocals and soft beats followed closely by rolling breaks, lowdown tummy rumbling bass and acid\njazz vocals. I know that almost every\nband adheres to some kind of formula,\nwhether they are conscious of it or not,\nbut I noticed it in particular here. It also\ncame as no surprise that track four is\nnon-existent (fear Of Fours?).\nI surprised myself by actually admitting that it was good, rather than just\nokay. The use of samples is about right,\nthe vocals are spot on and the production is excellent. It's still not my cup of\ntea, though it would be an asset to any\nmusic collection. H Christian\nHe' s got the obligatory dreads\nand beard but not because\nthey might be cool, just\nbecause. He lived on a boat, sailing\nround the Caribbean from the age of\nthree. He competed for Bermuda in\nthe world windsurfing championships\ntwice. He lives on the island of Nevis,\nwhere Alan McGee 'discovered' him.\nHe's not your usual recording artist. So\nsure, he's going to get all the attention\nbecause he's on the same label as\nOasis and he's a white man singing\nwhat sounds like reggae. But don't judge Mishka until you've heard what\nhe has to play.\nWhen you do hear It be prepared to\nenjoy it and to be surprised. This album\nis such a change from what's in the\ncharts at the moment that everyone\nshould listen to it at least once, but\nonce may not be enough. You'll either\nlove it or force yourself to listen a sec-on d, then a third time until you do. It's the kind of music that grows and grows\nas you absorb it more until you find\nyourself feeling incredibly at ease. Forget all your Fatboy Slims and your Steps,\nthis is the quiescent sound of the sum-mer. It's so laid-back and relaxed that\nnothing will phase you when you're listening to it. Perhaps it has something to\ndo with the husky, slightly melancholic\nvoice like on the current single Give\nYou All The Love, or maybe it's the\nstripped down guitar and harmonica on\nOne True, or it could even be that reggae organ on Lonely. Whatever it is,\nMishka is a supremely chilled album\ncontaining tracks that Marley would be\nproud of.\nOn the first listen when you're not\n'with the vibe' (man), the tracks do seem\nto have the annoying habit of sounding\nthe same. On further listening though,\nit's the clever nuances between tracks\nthat make them stand out, like the\nchurch bells, the subtle use of synth\nand harmonica. Okay, the songs are\nmostly all on the same subject of love\nand c it her how great it is or how crap it\nis, but the way it's sung, you don't care.\nMishka has all his shit together, and his\ndebut album might help you get yours\ntogether, too. 131 Christian\n\n"

Dress code - none.\nYou'd expect this night to be a bit of a cork er seeing\nfas how one of the members of the seminal band Leftlield\nf has a hand in it. However, seminal is not how I'd describe!\nIhis night. If you've been a regular reader of Clubscene\n; then you will know what a great venue Mass is, and how| nights such as Nymph use it to its full potential. The Shift-i ling Gears people have something to learn from them, If\npel. Half empty venues, monotonous, non-de script house, |\n|and seemingly pissed off punters does not really make for\n.the ideal night on the tiles. Also, the back room was|| devoted to some sort of perverted cross between dance!\ni music and the early 80s music. This is a worrying trend,\nf which must be stopped dead in Its tracks. Disco house may|\n| be a welcome addition to the increasingly wide genre of|| dance music, but any association with that most unfashionable of decades can only be harmful to a scene, which |\nis, after all partly driven by fashion.\nBut I'm not going to be totally harsh on the Shifting!\nj Gears people.

Absolutely fantastic - the only place to be seen strutting your stuff whilst donning your (or\nyour parents) finest 70s attire. So it'll come as no surprise that when we were\nasked along to their 10thb 'day party we had another stunning night.\nIt had all the best aspects of any Carwash Saturday night, but it was, of\ncourse, very much bigger, and personally, that little bit better. But, of course,\nyou'd expect that on anyone'sb 'day, now wouldn't you? It appears that size\ndoes matter after all.\nThe London Astoria is an old converted theatre, and this is still reflected\nin the layout of the club. It is very much like The Fridge in Brixton, with a huge\nbalcony-style upstairs area looking down on the huge dancefloor, and the gigantic stage. Plenty of room to pose above the rest of the crowd - as everyone\nlikes to do on these type of occasions. And, after all that's what Carwash is all\nabout. Being as extrovert (in a70s kind of way, of course) as you want to be\nand just letting it all hang loose for the night.\nA great night for all you Saturday Night fever freaks out there, which continues every Saturday at its usual London Astoria 2 venue.

    "content": "4 Letters 24 May 1999\nTravel or LT cards?\nDear Felix,\nI would like something clarified with\nregard to the London Transport Student\nDiscount scheme, namely what sorts of\ntickets we can get a discount on. You\nrefer throughout your news article (as\ndoes Dave in his Presidential talk-back) to\n\"travelcards\". I was under the impression\nthat the scheme only covered LT cards\nand bus passes. The distinction is imp or tant: Travelcards are valid on tubes, buses\nand trains, whereas LT cards are only\nvalid on tubes and buses - not trains. For\nthose of us who live south of the river,\ntrain and tube is often the only option\n(Kingston to college by train and tube: 45\nminutes, cf bus and tube: 1.5 hours!).\nPlease could you be more specific in\nyour wording in future, as I'm currently\npaying ~400 UKP p.a. more than I'd need\nto if the student discount applied to travelcards. helen-louise.\nPhysics PhD.\nYou aren't the only one confused -neither ICU nor the London Transport\nwebsite were able to explain It to me\naccurately. It Is true, however, that the\ncards CAN NOT be used on trains, as the\ndeal Is only with London Transport, and\nnot the regional train companies. The LT\nwebsite states\n\"[Youth LT cards] cost 30% less than\nthe equivalent adult rate Travelcard Season, but cannot be used on most\nNational Railways services (except on\njoint routes where there is inter-avail-ability) or for Underground journeys to\nand from Bakerloo line stations north of\nQueen's Park... [they] give unlimited\ntravel on Underground, London Transport Buses, including N prefixed Night\nBuses and Docklands Light Railway services within the zones selected.\"\nSo there you have it.

Basically, this\ninvolves getting the wheels off and back\non a Formula 1 car in the fastest time.\nThere's big prizes for the winning\nteams (last year the winners got a day's free go-karting), and prizes for the runners up and losers.\nThis year Andersen have invited\nteams from some of those other London\ncolleges, so there'll be a special edge to\nthe competition.\nIf you want to enter, there's still time\n- all you need is a team of 4 and a team\nname.

It is sad that we appear to have so\nlittle control over what we can and can't do/eat, even on our own campus - rather\nthan sound scientific minds being listened to, the ignorant ranting s of the\ntabloid press appear to be prefer ed. At such a centre for research as Imperial, surely we should be leading the way\nand supporting GM foods all the way. I shall never be taken for a ride with all this\n'organic' rubbish the supermarkets are set\nto make a killing on this summer.\nSupport research. Vote with your\nstomach.\nS.W. Cooper\nRegulating the Internet II\nDear Felix,\nI am writing in response to Mr Tse's letter \"Regulating the Internet\" in the last\nissue of Felix. I believe the basis of his letter was that if we expose children to violence through media, they become\nviolent. I do wonder if such an assumption is true? If any readers have observed\nseven year-olds watching an episode of\nPower Rangers, I'm confident they will\nagree with me when I say that it is accurate to a small degree (different children\nrespond differently). However, regulation is not a simple case of Good versus\nBad, as the aforementioned author\nseems to believe.\nThe wonder that is the Internet is that\nJoe Bloggs can come along and tell the\nworld what he thinks. This power is something very few of us have ever had\nbefore. A soapbox in Hyde Park won't reach more than a hundred. A book has\ngreater potential, but it spends its life on\na shelf in Waterstones (and only once the\nauthor has persuaded a publisher to publish it). The Internet is the only medium\nwhere anyone can say what they want,\nunaltered, to a world-wide audience. Regulation would take this power away.\nIs this such a bad thing? If we pretend\nthat last week's issue of Felix is a regulated Internet, and that it's regulator is the\neditor, Mr Tse has no control over the\nappearance of his letter. I doubt whether\nMr Tse would be a happy man if he spent\nhours writing his letter, only to find it\nwasn't there. Of course, it is easy to say\nwe'll \"only regulate the porn\" or \"ban the\nfascism\". All this simply means is that the\nregulator's morals get forced down the\nauthor's throat. Is it ethical to impose\nyour morals on someone else?\nAt the end of the day our capitalist\neconomy is driven by money. The adult\nentertainment businesses invest enormous amounts of money on improving\nnetwork connections and developing\ntechnologies such as streaming video.\nIndeed, Real Networks' biggest customers\nare adult websites. Online credit card\nprocessing was invented by a Canadian\npornographic website. The sad fact is\npeople want their porn: 90 - 95% of all\nmale net users have visited pornographic\nsites. If children and the Internet are\nincompatible, it is far more cost effective\nto remove the former rather than regulate latter.\nMartyn Whitwell.\n(Physics I) Eat, Praise, Have a ball\nSir,\nI read with interest \"In brief\" (Felix, 17 May\n1999), and in particular the Director of\nEstates' proposal to renovate the SCR. I note that the entire project is still waiting\nfor funding confirmation - why? It's a catering/conference outlet! There is surely\nno question here - John Foster and\nAnnette de Lima will benefit, so they\nshould dig deep into their voluminous\npockets and stump up the cash. Alternatively, Mr Caldwell should turn the whole\nspace into a food hall (Burger King,\nMcDonalds etc) and move the SCR to the\nRector's flat at 170 Queen's Gate. The\nmystery of the SCR still evades me - why\nare staff happy to pay inflated prices for\nthe same food which is served cheaper\nat the M DH downstairs? Hmmmm, and\nthey say our academic staff are the best\nin the land. I remain to be convinced...\nAnd before you put this down as\nanother letter from a cranky old hack, can\nI take the opportunity to congratulate\nDave Hellard on a largely successful year\nat ICU? I must admit to being sceptical\nwhen he took over, but he has proved to\nbe a competent and popular President. I only hope Natasha Newton manages to\nkeep up with the momentum he has\nestablished...\nFinally, can I urge everybody to\nattend the ICU Summer Ball? It's a fantastic event, so great that I still can't remember what happened last year... so\ngo. See if you can get the College Secretary drunk - it'll be worth it...\nI remain, Sir, your humble and obedient servant,\nAndy Heeps\nDeadline for letters for\nis 12noon Wednesday.\nLetters may be edited for length, but\nwill not be altered in any other way.\nLetters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\n\n"

    "content": "24\nMay\n1999\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Imperial Staff Will Strike Tomorrow\nMembers of the Association of University Teachers (AUT), which includes\nthe majority of Imperial's academic\nstaff, are to strike tomorrow, Tuesday\n25 May. The strike is likely to effect lectures and examinations, as well as disrupting other services throughout\ncollege. The strike, which is the result\nof an ongoing pay dispute, will only\naffect the South Kensington campus,\nas clinical staff have received a different pay settlement to other academics. As Felix went to press, the scale of\nthe strike's effects was unknown. It is\npossible that some or all of tom or row's examinations will go ahead, with\nthe college finding alternative exam-in ers. Alternatively, the day's academic work could be rescheduled for\nBy Ed Sexton\nlater this term. Ms Laura Barker, IC's AUT president, hoped \"that the students do not come in that day\", as a sign of support for the strikers, adding\nthat she \"will stand behind students\nwho skip exams\", suggesting the college could successfully reschedule\nthem. David Hellard, ICU President,\nwas more wary, suggesting that if students had exams or other essential\nwork to do, then they should come in\nto college. On a more conciliatory note\nhe added \"if you don't need to come\nin, I wouldn't bother, as a sign of com-ra de ship\". Students will not be prevented from entering the campus and,\nalthough it is likely that there will be\npicket lines, Ms Barker assured Felix\nthat strikers would merely \"seek to persuade peacefully\".\nThe strike action has the support of\nthe National Union of Students (NUS),\nas well as other unions representing\nuniversity staff. In a letter dated 10\nMay from NUS President Andrew\nPakes, to the AUT, he described the\n3.5% salary increase that had been\noffered to AUT members as \"a derisory\npay offer\". The letter continued; \"I have\nevery faith in you and your union that\nyou will do your utmost to minimise\nthe impact of this action on students\nat exam time.\" Ms Barker agreed,\nemphasising \"students aren't our tar-get\". She went on to explain plans for\nthe pay deducted from striking staff to\nbe given to student hardship funds at\nImperial, an action which could be\nseen as an attempt at compensation\nfor the disruption.\nIt is unlikely that the strike on its\nown will achieve the AUT's objectives.\nMs Barker agreed, describing it as \"a demonstrative action - the start of a process\". That \"process\" is likely to\ninvolve a four day boycott of examination administration in June, which\ncould further disrupt students' exams,\nand action during the hectic recruitment period in late summer.\nMore on the strike on page 2\nand on page 5\nLondon Student Blows Up a Storm\nLondon Student, the newspaper serving\nthe students of the University of London, was threatened with legal action\nas a result of an article published in\ntheir issue of April 30. Professor Zellick,\nthe Vice Chancellor of the University of\nLondon, allegedly threatened to sue\nLondon Student and its editor, as well\nas the University of London Union, in\nresponse to the article, entitled \"Mad\nProf Demands Barmy ULU Ballots\".\nThe article in question reported that\nhe had caused some disturbance in\nunion circles with his judgement that\nthe recently held ULU elections \"didn't comply\" with the Education Act. Professor Zellick ruled that all future elections to ULU posts had to be done with\na cross-campus ballot.

Previous mis demean ours with techno and\ntrashy rock have been honed and further\ninfused with blues, folk, bluegrass,\ngospel and the kitchen-sink to create an\nelectronic cornucopia.\nThere's the gospel tinged Why Does\nMy Heart Feel So Bad?, whilst Find My\nBaby is The Rolling Stones with drum\nloops. Honey is a sassy piano-driven tune\nwith hip-hop beats and slide-guitar and\nthe closing song My weakness sounds\nlike an aural Ascension.\nIt's an album of bliss ed out, mellow,\nambient tracks interspersed by glorious\ndance tracks; and that's dance in the\nsense that you can dance to the music,\nthere being lateral rhythms to which you\ncan glide; not dance in the sense that to\ndance to the music one must assume\nthe actions of a chicken-necked android,\nwhilst vainly trying to pick out a melody\nthat has all but been bludgeoned to a messy pulp by a deranged drum-machine.\nThat's not to say the album is particularly forward looking. Many tracks\necho the sound of Robert Miles (this is\nvery bad), others could have been lifted\nwholesale off the Tim Booth and Angelo\nBadalamenti collaboration Booth and\nthe Bad Angel (this is very good) and\nmany tunes could be passed off as surfacing during the second summer of\nlove in 1988 (which isn't such a bad\nthing either). Now if that was the long\nand short of it we'd be looking at maybe\nfour stars but at various junctures it all\ngets a bit ugly, that confounded-bastard-son-of-House Techno shows its pitiful\nmug and objectivity is debunk, rationality is cast to the wind; so in the interest\nof not exhausting my well of spiteful\npolemics we'll leave it at that. _ _\nChris\nMake no mistake, this is hip-hop. These are musicians.\nThese aren't some bunch of\nguys who got lucky and busted there\nway into the studio, made a funky\nvideo and got to number one. This is all\nabout stories and beats and rhyme.\nThis album has all in abundance and\nmore. Put simply this is simply the best\nhip-hop album I have heard all year.\nStandout tracks. Well, it's very hard.\nThe problem with a band like the Roots\nis that they arc in real danger of burning themselves out - with each track\nyou wonder if it can possibly get any bet-ter. At a push, I would pick You Got Mc\n(featuring Erykah Badu) with its wicked\njungle dying moments, Act Too (The\nLove of My Life) which is just too smooth\nand Dynamite! - that last one just swings.\nf he production is a breath of fresh\nair in the increasingly electronic sounding industry, this sounds fresh and real\n-The Roots have managed to translate\ntheir live sound into a recording.\nThe only gripe with this album is\nthat its purchase wil! inevitably make\nthe rest of you t collection sound poor in\ncomparison. This is a great yardstick for\naspiring rappers and all to aim for - The\nRoots have set the pace for 1999 - can\nanyone match them? CI\nJoel\nSingles\nCharlotte - Skin\nThis song brings back memories of those half-pop,\nhalf-dance numbers with a yelping female singer\non it that were all the rage when I was about f if teen. So, it's alright, but a bit behind the times.\nSnow Pony - Easy Way Down\nSome really relaxed indie rock that mellows you\nout and seems to include bits from just about\nevery Stone Roses song I know. And somewhat\nstrangely, the singer is a woman. Even weirder, it\nworks.\n3 Colours Red - This Is My Time\nThere was a bit of a stir going on when Beautiful\nDay was released at the beginning of the year. It\ncertainly appeared that 3 Colours Red were going\nto have a successful year. However, the subsequent release of their more traditional rock-metal\nefforts was met with general apathy. So, it's back\nto the 'slow ies' in the search for that elusive top\nten hit.\nJamella- So High\nA bit like Shola Ama but with nowhere near the\nvocal talents and with some Missy Elliot-style ad\nlib s thrown In. So just your basic R'n' B track really.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Supergrass - Pumping On Your Stereo\nJudging by the critical acclaim but poor sales for their last album, it's hard to gauge the ensuing reaction to this single. It's described by\nthe band as being in the vein of Rebel Rebefeta Bowie, but that's only half the story. Like so many Supergrass songs, this track is alive\nwith energy and extremely enjoyable to listen to.\nBlondle - Nothing Is Real But The Girl\nTheir comeback single Maria proved that Deborah Harry could still sing and the band could still\nplay, but the general disregard for the accompanying album showed that the public thought\nit just a one-off. And they were right too, for this\nsong is weak and dull and the vocals are strangled and flat.\nStereophonies - Pick A Part That's New\nThe obvious joke is to say that it's hard to pick a part that's new from this song. That's the problem with the Stereophonies, their songs are all\nvery similar. We're becoming familiar with the\nnow clich ed Kelly Jones vocal, that stretches out\nthe last word In each line.\nLaptop - Nothing To Declare\nFor a band with a rather modern name (unless\nreferring to some seedy strip joint) these guys are\nfirmly stuck fifteen years in the past. This song\nperfectly mimics Talking Heads, even down to\ncunning lyrical twists such as the line 'I 've got\nnothing to declare, except my loneliness.' Retro\nbut great.CJ\nEdJ.\n\n"

And you'd be absolutely right. Think Mariokart64\nwith tanks and without the irritating Nintendo-style e cuddly animals, and you\nhave a pretty good idea of what lies\nwithin this game. You have a variety of\ntanks (which could never\nbe confused with real\ntanks, oh no) to drive\neach with slightly different characteristics, you\nhave a variety of courses\nsome of which could be\nconfused with a small\nWiltshire village) over\nwhich to discover what\nthose differences are, you\nhave things to run over\n(cows, signs, dustbins and\n- ' - ' so on) and you have a variety of power-ups with which to shoot\nyour fellow Tank Racees. And that's about it.\nExcept that it's fun. Lots of fun.\nEven the singleplayer\ngame (usu-ally the big\nlet down in\ngames of this\nsort) is fun.\nTank Racer\nI doesn't pretend to be\npushing back\nthe boundaries of PC\ngaming in\nany way, just\ndoes exactly\nwhat it says on the tin.

Thirty-nine\nfirst-year students at feeds have\nreceived ominous letters warning\nthem that they shall not be allowed to\ncontinue their studies following the\nsummer vacation if they do not pay\nup.\nLeeds University Union (LUU) is\nmeanwhile campaigning for the\ndefaulters to stay on to continue their\neducation next year, their efforts taking the form of what appears to be a successful postcard-signing campaign,\nattracting over three hundred signatories by Monday 1 7 May. The cam-pa ign, which aims to induce University\nadministrators to withdraw their\nthreats, has also received media attention across the nation, being featured\non the BBC web site, on Ceefax and\nTeletext and in both local and national\npress (Yorkshire Post, Yorkshire\nEvening Post, London Metro, Look\nNorth and The Guardian). The UniverBy Sunil Rao\ns it y itself has shown little by way of\nsigns of relenting, however.\nProtests at Leeds aren't exactly a new thing, with last years' day-long\noccupation of a lecture theatre by\nover a hundred protesting students\nacting as a poignant reminder of student protests from May 1968, led by\nthe then Leeds University Union President, a certain Jack Straw, though\nthose protests had in reality more to\ndo with battling controversial rightwing attitudes than with more down-to-earth issues.\nThe tone and timing of the letter\nfrom university management, sent out\non the eve of the annual end-of-year\nexaminations, were described by Anna\nRichards, Communications Officer at\nLUU responsible for liaising with the\nmedia, as being \"very intimidating\".\nMost of the students involved would\nnow probably be feeling \"ten times\nworse\" about their financial problems,\ngiven that this is the reason cited by\nmost of the protesting fresher s for\ntheir non-payment, though an intrepid\nfew have refused to pay on principle.\nLeeds remains a popular university\nwith applicants, attracting more UCAS\napplications than any other institution\nin Britain, and the university administration had previously expressed its\ndisapproval over the way the fee system is currently being handled, and\nhad anticipated that a number of students would be worried about running up large debts and might even\nseriously consider \"withdrawing from\ncourses because of financial hard-ship\", feeds University has stated that\nit has not made it its policy to forcibly\nevict students from courses for not\npaying fees, and that every case will\nbe treated on its own merits.\nMeanwhile students refusing to\npay fees at University College London\n(UCL) still face an uncertain future,\nwith both college authorities and\nstudents showing little sign of\ncompromise.\nHumanities\nCompetition\nAs part of its humanities programme,\nImperial College is to hold a \"Technical\nPresentations Competition\".

    "content": "Feature 24 May 1999\nCycling in Nepal\nFrom personal experience Oliver Hawkins describes the pitfalls of cycling In this hilly and logistically difficult country\nDescribed as \"the Mecca of world mountain biking\", the\nHimalayan kingdom of Nepal offers lots of challenges\nto adventurous cyclists. Unlike its two sprawling neigh-b ours, India and Tibet, much of the country and sights,\nincluding ancient Buddhist and Hindu temples and\nviews of Mount Everest, are in easy reach from the cities\nof Kathmandu and Pokhara. Also, it is said that you are\nten times more likely to be involved in a car crash in\nNepal than in Britain, and only limited areas of the country are open for trekking. Cycling allows close contact\nwith the famously friendly and tolerant Nepalese pe o ple, as well as affording greater freedom than buses and\ncars in where to go, making it a very attractive option.\nTherefore, with the help of some of the pupils at the\nschool in Kathmandu where I was teaching, and along\nwith four other British volunteer teachers, I bought a mountain bike from a local shop. From the many experiences we had and mistakes made, here are the things\nto be avoided...\n1 Cheap Bikes\nOur first trip was a steep learning curve and a lesson in the false economy of buying cheap. Between\nus, we suffered eight breakdowns of some form or\nanother in two hours, although we persevered until\na friend was thrown in a somersault over his han-dle bars, fortunately escaping unhurt. Although the\nmany cycle shops are helpful and virtually free, they\nare not equipped for geared bikes and on several\noccasions they used a brick to hammer handlebars\ninto shape. My advice would be to spend the extra\nrupees and hire a much more reliable bike, such as\nthose from 'Himalayan Mountain Bikes' in Thamel,\nKathmandu.\n2 Guide Book Authors\nOur guide for some of the trips we made was James\nGiambronie, through his book 'Kathmandu Valley\nBikes and Hikes'. We got some good ideas on places\nto visit, but his \"intrepid routes\" invariably ended in\na dead end or a path washed away by the tec cnt monsoon, a problem common to even the major\nroads in Nepal. Getting lost is not all bad though, as\nlong as it is not getting dark, as you can find yourself in places off the beaten track and more fascinating for it. People were often very willing to invite\nus into their homes, allowing an insight into rural\nNepali life. The reality for most Nepalis today is\ncomplex and varied, not as simplistic as the 'mountains and mysticism' portrayal in some tourist pub li cations. Noticeable aspects include the rapid\nmodernisation, distributed unequally th tough the\ncountry, alongside harsh rural poverty and a strong\ninfluence of tradition, family and religion.\n3 Natural Disasters\nmust be taken with care. Two of these we took\nwere almost a kilometre height difference between\nthe top and the bottom, and on one, a friend\ncrashed at speed after his brakes locked, and he was\nincredibly lucky to escape with only cuts and a few\nbruises.\n5 Cows\nCows are sacred in Nepal where the majority of the\npopulation are Hindus, and killing a cow can result\nin jail sentences of up to 10 years. Avoiding a collision is therefore very much advisable, although the\ncyclist would probably come off worse. Nepalese\ncows are mostly urban animals, preferring the busy,\ndirty city life, where they can scavenge the roadside\nrubbish heaps, to the peaceful countryside, so traffic can become a slalom around the animals on even\nthe crowded city streets.\nObviously good to avoid, but il should be remembered that the contrasts in the climate are great in\nNepal, with only two seasons, the Monsoon and the\nDry Season. Getting caught cycling in a Monsoon downpour can be very dangerous, especially on\nmud paths. However, you can usually see the rain\ncoming, sometimes literally as an advancing wall of\nwater, so you have time to find shelter.\nFreak weather can also happen during the dry\nseason. On one occasion, one of our bikes broke a few hours into a three-day journey to a remote village called Palanchowk Bhagwati, in the foothills\nnear the Tibetan border. As we started to look for a repair shop, we noticed that a tornado had formed\nclose behind us, so we quickly flagged down a passing truck, threw our bikes into the back and climbed\nonto the roof. This was probably no safer than staying near the tornado however, as we spent the next\nten miles hanging on to the single roof bar to avoid\ngetting thrown off as the truck sped around corners.\n4 Admiring the View\nThe reward of struggling to the top of one of the\nHimalayan foothills is incredible views of some of the\nmost spectacular scenery in the world. However, the\nmountain roads often have drops of hundreds of\nmetres off one side, with no protective barriers, so\nthe descents, which can be very fast and exciting,\n6 Buses\nMy only crash was into the back of a stopping bus,\nat about 5 to 10 miles per hour. Buses are renowned\nfor their aggressive driving and for being so full that\npeople often hang on to the outside or sit on the\nroof. Sitting on the roof with the luggage tied on is\noften more comfortable than inside, especially in hot\nweather, although it is in theory illegal and dangerous as there is usually only a roof rack to hold on to.\nBuses are however frequent and ridiculously cheap,\ncosting as little as 3p for a five-mile journey, and\nwhen your bike has broken or the hill is just too long\nand steep they will take bikes for about 50p extra.\ny..: Chinese Tibet\nal / Kathmandu\n\u2022r'\\ Mt Everest\n-* ' ^ ,\nIndia\n\u2014 \u2014 \" /I.*%**/~V' V. \u201e \\ }\nRoy; 1 tW\\ MO/*i "

In fact Kevin\nbelieves coffee is the fuel, the raw material for much of the work which goes on\nwithin IC. Students can often be overheard talking to each other about the\neffects of caffeine addiction,- withdrawal;\nand as exam time approaches worrying\nabout the possible side effects of their\nincreasing caffeine intake. Two branches\nof the brilliant Starbucks, within a few\nminutes walk of the South Ken. campus\nonly encourage the habit. Kevin has\nheard of some students being lucky\nenough to get tutorials time tabled at\nStarbucks! However due to the rather\ncosy size of the place, if this becomes\ncommon practice double bookings could\nbe problematic. Perhaps Starbucks\nshould be incorporated into the IC room\nbooking system, so as to ensure the\ncomfortable seats are free. Coffee\naddicts looking for accommodation for\nnext year may be interested to note that\nthe flats above Starbucks on Kensington\nHigh Street are up for sale at the\nmoment.
