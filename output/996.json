    "content": "2 News\nSouthside Shop Discount\ni Students flock to take advantage of the 5% discount after a successful advertising campaign\nBY SIMON SHAW\nSouthside Shop has begun offering\na discount to students after protests\nover what some students feel are\nunfairly high prices.\nAll students at Imperial College\nare eligible for the 5% discount\nwhich applies after 3pm during the\nweek. Restricting the discount to\noff-peak hours has been justified as\nan attempt to avoid long queues.\nThe discount applies to all goods\non sale other than price-fixed items\nsuch as cigarettes, phone cards and\nnewspapers.\nThe discounts began operating\nbefore Easter in response to a student petition started by Southside\nresidents and approved by the\nUnion Executive Committee. The\npetition was in protest to the prices\nof some items in the shop compared to other shops in the area.\nManager of Southside Shop,\nRicky Sharp, told Felix that \"a couple\" of students had asked for\nthe discount since the scheme had\nbeen in operation. With the shop\nreceiving approximately a thousand customers a day during term\ntime, a lack of advertising may be\nthe reason for the slow uptake.\nThe system is not without its\nproblems. At present, cash tills in\nthe shop are not able to apply the\ndiscount to individual items and\nsub-totals. This leads to problems\nwhen students are buying both discounted and price-fixed items. Mr\nSharp said they would \"more than\nlikely be changing the tills\".\nFurther changes are currently being\ndiscussed by College Catering\nServices.\nThe present discounting procedure is still in its infancy and Mr Sharp said that he is always willing\nto talk to students and listen to\ntheir suggestions on matters relating to the Shop.\nExport\nAward\nImperial College has been given\nThe Queen's Award for Export\nAchievement.\nThe Award has been granted as\na result of a40.9% increase in\noverseas income to \u00a319,877,000 in\n1992/93 from \u00a314,106,000 during\n1991/92. This income is primarily\nfrom overseas research contracts\nand grants and fees from overseas\nstudents.\nThis is the second time that\nCollege has gained this award. The\nfirst was in 1990 for its \u00a34.5 million increase in income from the\nExport of UK Services (Invisible\nExports) during 1986-89.\nThe Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, said: \"We are delighted\nto have received this award for the\nsecond time. It gives particular\npleasure because it demonstrated\nthe international recognition of the\nCollege's excellence in both teaching and research.\"\nMarathon\nThe Felix staff would like to congratulate Marcus Krackowizer on\nhis achievement in this year's London Marathon.\nMr Krackowizer, a third year\nAeronautical Engineering student,\ncompleted the Marathon in a wheelchair with a time of 2 hrs 56\nmins and 57 sees. This put him\n36th in the overall positions.\nMr Krackowizer performed his\nown training for the race and, in\nconjunction with the College\nDisabilities Office, raised sponsorship to go toward medical research.\nHot Cross Suns\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe Electrical Engineering building\nwas burgled over Easter.\nOn 3rd April, the door of room\n1005 was found forced open. Nine\nSun workstations, worth a total of\n\u00a345,000, were missing.\nA week later, on 10th April, at\napproximately 6pm, a man was\nspotted by a shift engineer carrying\ntwo heavily laden bags. Security\nwere called in. They challenged the\nman who fled, leaving the bags\nbeside a skip by the Royal College\nof Music. The man was caught on\nQueensgate and brought back to\nCollege, where police officers from\nChelsea, Belgravia, Kensington and\nDiplomatic Protection divisions\nwere waiting. One of the Patrol\nOfficers called found eight more\nSun workstations in the bags.\nThe man is currently on bail\nafter being questioned in connection\nwith both burglaries.\nA week before the first break-in,\napproximately \u00a330,000 worth of\ncomputer hardware was stolen from\nthe Physics department. Other\nUniversity of London colleges have\nalso experienced similar burglaries,\nsuggesting an organised criminal\ncampaign.\nCollege security has also arrested one of a gang of three people\nseen trying to break into cars to\nremove their phones. This occured\nduring the World Occupational\nTherapy Congress held at Imperial\nCollege two weeks ago. The arrest\noccurred on Cromwell Road after a sighting of one of the gang the day\nafter they were first spotted.\nSecurity are urging people\nresponsible for valuable equipment\nto ask for advice on protecting it\nfrom theft. They are also reminding\npeople to make sure their offices\nand cars are locked and to report\nanything suspicious to Sherfield\nSecurity on extension 3372.\nNew albums from Blur and Madder Rose reviewed next week\n\n"

This film blew the top off of the\nAmerican box office and is being hyped to do\nthe same on this side of the Atlantic.\nThe plot is fun and well paced, but what\nmakes or breaks the film is Mr Carrey. He made\nit big in the American TV comedy 'In Living\nColor' and is already 'star' enough to be the\nday's guest on Sesame Street.\nHis style of humour is very fresh, with a face\nmalleable enough to make Phil Cool seem\nwooden. Already likened to Jerry Lewis, the thing\nthat sets Jim Carrey aside is his plethora of\nexpressions, similar to that of Aardman\nAnimations (who did the Creature Comforts Ads).\nAny hopeful fans should be warned that this\nstyle of humour (sorry, humor) is different\nenough not to be to everyone's tastes, but I would think that most people will find enough\nhumour in the film to make it worth giving it a goI found the film hilarious, but if it had gone\non much longer than 100 minutes I might have\nfelt differently - even the greatest choco holi c can get sick of chocolate after a couple of hours\nof face stuffing.\nStill, you do come away wanting more, but at\na later date, and that's exactly what you'll be\ngetting with his second film coming out this\nsummer, and there are already s equals to Ace\nVentura in the pipeline.\nWhether people like it or not, this film will\nbe a hit, though Jim Carrey's long term appeal\nremains to be seen.\nFinally, American Football fans should go\nsee this film, if for no other reason than the\nguest appearance of Dan Marino as himself.\nSphen\nOpens nationwide today. Warner West End, \u00a37\n(\u00a34 before 5pm, Mon-Fri).\nKalifornia\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis\nDirector: Dominic Sena\nDon't believe the reviews, this film is actually\npretty good.\nThe plot is a familiar one; essentially, it boils\ndown to a road movie as it would have been\ndone by John Carpenter, as two couples share a car on a trip to California and one of the guys\nturns out to be really, really horrible.\nThe performances are quite good (except for\nJuliette Lewis' extraordinarily vacuous bimbo)\nand the script isn't at all bad. The non-killer\ncouple are just a little too pretentious for my\n(and also most people's) liking.\nKalifornia is very well-paced and starts off\ninterestingly enough, but unfortunately loses its\n'what differentiates killers from normal people'\nangle when the Carpenterish bits kick in, which\nare admittedly well-enough done though.\nNot a bad film at all.\nJk\nOut already.

You could rent a beds it, but it's not exactly easy to do that sort of\nthing from home. Besides, in hall you're with\npeople who are in exactly the same situation as\nyourself. It's an ideal way to meet people\nas well, but then they're reducing the common\nroom facilities...\nWhen you do finally realise what you've let\nyourself in for, what can you do about it? You\ncan complain to the Union or to College, but\nthat doesn't seem to be doing any good for the\nresidents of Evelyn Gardens. But why should\nCollege bother? Their prices are ever so slightly\ncheaper than living out, so people stay put.\nStudents can scream and shout as much as they\nlike but, come the end of the year, a whole new\ngroup of students arrive not knowing the\nsituation and the whole thing starts all over\nagain.\nMaybe sending letters to schools as the letter\non the opposite page suggests, is the only way to\nmake College sit up and take notice.\nCredits\nPrinter: Features:\nAndy Thompson Joe McFadden\nAaysha Shah\nBusiness Managers: Natasha Loder\nSteven Newhouse Anas Ayoub\nSimon Govier\nMusic:\nTyping & Proofing: Jon Jordan\nWei Lee\nTim St Clair Opera:\nJoe McFadden Patrick Wood\nPuzzles: Photography:\nSphinx Ivan Chan\nBryan Crotaz\nNews:\nCinema: Mike Ingram\nWei Lee Simon Shaw\nJoe McFadden Joe McFadden\nTell It How It Is\nDo you think you were mislead about IC before\nyou came here?

'The Satanic Verses' does\nnot constitute a \"criticism\" of Islam; rather it\npresents a multitude of insult, abuse and\nunsubstantiated accusations against the person\nof Muhammad and other prominent Islamic\ncharacters. The author falsifies remarks\nconcerning the prophet and his companions,\ncharges them with ethical lapses and sexual\nperversion and derides the Islamic tenets in the\nmost offensive and obscene manner.\nBritish law does not allow such profanity\nagainst the Christian faith, but fails to provide\nthe same kind of protection for other religions.\nPublicly ridiculing Jesus Christ is a criminal\noffence and subject to prosecution; insulting\nMuslims and their prophet is not. It is this clear\nline of discrimination and double standard that\nhas outraged the Muslim community.\nMay I suggest to Mr France and to anyone\nelse who seeks the truth in this matter, to study\nSalman Rushdie's novel and then judge for\nthemselves whether they would tolerate that\nkind of slanderous abuse against a member of\ntheir own family, let alone the dearest and most\nrespected leader of their faith.\nYours faithfully,\nYasser Hatami\nElec Eng 2\nCAREERS INFORMATION\nVacancies.

    "content": "16 Reviews\nL3Rollins Band\nWeight\nSurvival. A heavy word and one that Henry\nRollins undoubtedly had in mind when he wrote\nthis album. After all, he may be an actor, body-builder, book publisher, comedian and video\ncollaborator, but at the end of the day he still\nneeds to find catharsis and, for the moment, that\nlies in his music.\nWe're left in no doubt as to the intensity of\nthe man's frustration with all things life related\nwhen he cries, \"I wanna disconnect myself, pull\nmy brainstem out and unplug myself,\" during\nthe opener 'Disconnect'. And by the time 'Fool'\nkicks in with lines like \"Self-mutilation is the\nonly thing I know\", you'd be forgiven for\n*Miiiiiiiliiiini'\"-thinking you were an audience to some kind of\nsuicide trip. Not so, for although Rollins can be\nself-effacing with the best of them and has lost\nnone of his visceral contempt, the arrival of new\nbassist, Melvin Gibbs, has led to an psycho-deli c backdrop for the diatribes. Nowhere is this more\nevident than on the album's creative zenith,\n'Liar'. Here a spoken word intro, laid over some\nfunky, fusion guitar work, leads to the paint\nstripping taut of \"I am a liar, I 'll rip your heart\nout, I 'll burn your soul\".\nThankfully, there is light at the end of the\nproverbial tunnel. The final track, 'Shine', is a wake-up call that sees old Henry articulating his\nown manifesto. \"No such thing as free time,\nspare time or downtime, all you've got is life\ntime...get up, get up, get up...It's your own time,\nit's hero time, it's time to shine.\" Well, you\nheard the man - shine to survive. (7) Vik\nMadder Rose\nPanic On\nAfter the clash of acclaim which signaled their\ndebut, 'Bring It Down', the horticultural is ts of\nNYC have taken some home-grown advice and\ndone exactly that: gone down. 'Panic On' is an\nalbum which applies its brakes and attempts a change of course. Perhaps this is only\nunexpected because of all the lazy Velvet\nUnderground, Juliana Hatfield, Mazzy Star\ncomparisons which tend to dog their steps.\nMadder Rose speak more of Yo La Tengo\ninfluences and that's the camp they approach, if\nany at all.\nWith that straight, 'Panic On' becomes\nclearer. Only the superb 'Car Song' is of the old\nschool. The rest are of a very different breed.\nThere's a peculiar naivety involved for one.\nBilly's guitar and Mary's underplayed vocals are\nskewed, destined never to meet but always to\nflirt towards a connection. Mary's writing is also\nmore in evidence this time and it is her 'Happy\nNew Year' which best shows their maturing\ncourse.\nIt's plain creepy and yet retains the lyrical\nsharpness which has been one of their greatest\nstrengths. \"He had this weird ability, he wanted\nthem to sing, so he unchained every melody.\"\nThe Righteous Brothers should be chilled right\nthrough. Equally, the guts of 'Car Song' rotate\naround the anti-dream call of \"I think of you all\nday long, so try and get some sleep\". Sleep has\nbecome an escape from waking obsession.\nMadder Rose have still to produce their\nmasterpiece but 'Panic On' is more messy and\nindividualistic than we were led to believe.\nThey're heading out of a crowded planet of\nsound into their own garden. Time to listen out\nfor the sound of buds ripening. (8)\nFour weeks to catch up on,\nincluding the day that will\nshape the music papers' year.\nThe man who wanted to be\nalone finally got his way and\nleft the building. Wait for\nthose tribute albums to roll in.\nTo more stirring matters. Joe Henry is not\nperhaps well known in the Rock Hall of Fame.\nOne, because he is more roots than urban and\ntwo, because he only released his Fireman's Wedding EP on Monday. A young timer playing\nold, he invokes a bluegrass style which hits you\nin whatever gaping hole you carry as a heart.\nNot one for avoiding trouble, he even manages\nto use Billy Bragg's nasal tones to effect.\nThere's gold in them there hills.\nAnd in a terrifying chain of coincidence, the\nman Joe has just finished touring with is up next\nand has brought some friends. Jimmy Dale\nGilmore and Mudhoney play an interesting\ngame of swap and match as they cover each\nothers songs. Blinding Sun and Tonight I Think\nI'm Gonna Go Downtown are the articles in\nquestion, before everyone combines on Townes\nvan Zandt's Buckskin Stallion Blues. Deja vu\nanyone? (Look right if not.)\nA slow entry masks the return of those ol'\nnavel glazer s, Ride. This time they are lifting up\ntheir eyes to heaven and they're spying a blackbird. Hence the title track. Birdman\ndoesn't sound that inspiring but it is\natmospheric in its own chilly way.\nThe Flying Nuns are not atmospheric or\ninspiring, though I'd be surprised to see Sister\nWendy and her brood launching through the\nether. But the nuns in question are more satisfied\nto sound like Pavement, which is no problem,\njust don't feel cheated. The single is Yard.\nI started off hating Come's Wrong Side but I was hijacked. You have to admire their ability\nto violently underplay a song that it grips you so\ntightly by the throat, the last sounds you hear are\nhowling white girl blues. There's an excellent\nwoodcut record cover too.\nAnd then there are things that\nmake you go u ur gg g gh! Well,\nmaybe only ur gh. The G in Blossoms are pleasant and I thought that Allison Road was\ngreat but Found Out About\nYou, the current single, is\nbland fock (or ro lk), a case of milking an album\nfor too many singles? 81 Mulberry are also\ndown in the dumps as they journey across South\nAnna River. Tangential guitars are hauled back\nat the last minute and everything ends up coarse.\nI'm surprised about the status of singles from\nthe Walkabouts and Monsterland. Both bands\nare garnished with critical praise but the goods\ndon't appear to be on the shelf at the moment.\nMonsterland's All One With Time mini-album\nis rather flat, despite the second track being\ncalled Jane Wiedlin Used To Be A Go-Go As\nFar As We Know. The Walkabout's Good Luck\nMorning is more brutal than I thought they got\nand I don't like it. Goodnight. Tintin.\nwe've missed you, we've missed you, we've gone far away\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 5\nThe Indian Cow\nCalcutta's Telegraph has an answer paper of a candidate at a recent UPSC (erstwhile the Indian\nCivil Service during the British Raj) exam. The\ncandidate has written a compulsory essay on 'The\nIndian Cow' - to be written in English.\n\"The Cow is a successful animal. Also he is\nquadruped, and because he is female, he give\nmilk, but will do so when he is got child. He is\nsame like god, sacred to Hindus and useful to\nman. But he has got four legs together. Two are\nforwards and two are afterwards.\n\"His whole body can be utilised for use.\nMore so the Milk. What can it do? Various ghee,\nbutter, cream, curd, why and the condensed milk\nso forth. Also he is useful to cobbler, waterman s and mankind generally.\n\"His motion is slow only because he is of\nas it udin io us species. Also his other motion is\nmuch useful to trees, plants as well as making\nflat cakes in hand and drying in the sun. His\nmotion after drying can be acted as a good fuel\nfor making tasty foods. Cow is the only animals\nthat extricates his feeding after eating. Then\nafterwards she chew with his teeth whom are\nsituated in the inside of the mouth. He is\nincessantly in the meadows in the grass.\n\"His only attacking and defending organ is\nthe horn, specially so when he is got child. This\nis done by bowing his head whereby he causes\nthe weapons to be paralleled to the ground of the\nearth and instantly proceed with great velocity\nforwards.\n\"He has got tails also, but not like similar\nanimals. It has hairs on the other end of the other\nside. This is done to frighten away the flies\nwhich alight on his co ho a body whereupon he\ngives hit with it.\n'The palms of his feet are soft unto the touch.\nSo the grasses head is not crushed. At night time,\nhe poses down on the ground and he shuts his\neyes like his relatives, the horse does not do so.\n\"This is the Cow\".\nP.S. We are informed that the candidate passed\nthe exam.\nFuture Positive?\nNatasha Loder writes on the future of women in\nscience and the problems faced by them.\nA recent science event arranged for Set7 brought\ntogether a team of scientists and politicians at\nthe London School of Economics to discuss the\nfuture of British Science.\nOne of the topics covered was that of the\nposition of women in science. A recent New\nScientist had commented that of the forty recent,\nprestigious, appointments to the Royal Society\n(RS) this year, only one was female. The Society\nwas likened to an Old Boy's Club in the best of\nBritish traditions.\nThe statistics proved horrifying. When one of\nthe panellist s, Jocelyn Bell, was made a Fellow,\nthe number of female astronomers in the society\nwere doubled! RS membership has remained\nstatic at 3% female from the sixties to the\npresent day.\nAnn Campbell (Labour MP) highlighted the\nroot of the problem. She said that despite the\nsurge of females into all areas of science and\ntheir increased promotion from lower to middle\ngrade, a recent survey found the real promotion\nblockage was between the middle and higher\ngrades. This 'glass ceiling' was blamed on a reluctance to promote women to high grades by\nmale superiors. Furthermore, any kind of career\nbreak was seen in a negative light by\nappointment and promotion boards.\nSadly, despite the fact that women have been\nactively encouraged to enter science, the bottom\nline still seems to be that the cards are\noverwhelmingly stacked against them.\nOur Time\nHas Come\nAnas Ayoub talks about\nthe winds of change that are blowing in\nSouth Africa\nThe winds of change are blowing in South\nAfrica. Over the past few years, this wealthy\ncountry, at the tip of the African continent, has\nundergone radical changes. Waves of hope have\nbeen washing onto the shores of the Cape.\nApartheid, which has deprived the blacks of\ntheir country's riches and killed many\nthousands, is no more.\nIn the months up to the elections, the people\nof South Africa have suffered greatly; the\nviolence between the ANC and the Inkatha\nFreedom Party has resulted in the deaths of\nhundreds. The people finally have freedom and,\nlike releasing a hungry lion from its cage, the\nblacks have shrugged off all the oppression,\nracism and prosecution that they have been\nsuffering from since the turn of the century.\nSouth Africa must now look to the future.\nThis beautiful country has the potential to be\none of the great countries of the world. This\ndepends on the policies of the new African\ngovernment. Will they turn to communism? The\nANC is known to be leftist and it favours a centrally regulated economy. This threatens the\ncapitalist institutions of the country. The ANC's manifesto promises jobs, houses and a better life\nfor the million living in squalid conditions in the\nhometowns.\nWill Mandela's government rush to fulfill its\npromises and borrow billions from the IMF and\nthe World Bank? Will Mandela's already\nscandal ridden top men cash in? Will the Zulus\nreturn to the carnage we saw in the precedence\nto the elections? Will the blacks raid the\nAfrikaaner farms? All these question remain to\nbe answered. The country is at a crossroads.\nIn a continent where tragedy and suffering\nthrive, South Africa has been a light at the end\nof the tunnel. Will South Africa be a paragon for\nAfrica, or will it will be forgotten and become\nanother debt-ridden sub-saharan African nation?\nAll we can do is wish South Africa all the\nbest and, like the ANC banners read, 'Our Time\nHas Come'.\nYes, their time has come, but what will they\ndo with it?\nRead all about this year's Rag Fete on page 8\n\n"

Meanwhile, Kes's father John (Gallagher) has started a relationship\nwith an assistant school mistress, Callie\n(Whalley-Kilmer). They plan to be married once\nthe divorce procedures are over. However, when\nJude re-enters their lives, she not only wants the\nboys but also her husband.\nAt first Jude is unable to seduce John back\ninto her disturbed life. John tries to prevent Jude\nseeing the boys, but with the law being on her\nside, she is allowed access. On their first visit\nshe showers them with gifts, hoping to win them\nback. The younger brothers willingly accept\ntheir mother's presents and quickly forgive her.\nHowever, Kes still resents the fact that Jude\nabandoned them and gives her the cold shoulder,\nregarding the gifts as a simple bribe and so\nmaintains a continued denial of her supposedly\ngenuine love for the family.\nFrom then, Jude slowly imposes herself on all\nof them, even threatening Callie at school.\nDuring each visit Kes unwittingly starts to trust\nJude and is brain-washed into thinking that\nCallie was the cause of the separation, despite\nthe fact that she did not meet John until long\nafter Jude had left.\nFinally Jude devises an elaborate plan to kill\nCallie, hoping that once she is removed, the\nfamily can be reunited. This plan is the most\nabsurd aspect of the film, requiring Kes to be\nable to drive a car, but being under-age he has to\nbe taught by Jude.\nThe first half of the film has a few heart\nstopping scenes and I expected the rest to have\nthe same suspense. But as the plot evolves it\nbecomes ridiculous; the final death scene has the\nclich ed car hanging over a cliff edge.\nMagpie\nOpens nationwide today. Warner West End, \u00a37\n(\u00a34 before 5pm, Mon-Fri).\nFearless\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, Isabella Rosselini,\nRosie Perez\nDirector: Peter Weir\nDuring a business flight, there is a complete\nhydraulic failure. Max suddenly has to face his\nfear of flying, and in facing the threat of death,\novercomes his phobia and is no longer afraid.\nAfter the crash landing, he leads the survivors to\nsafety, and is heralded as a hero. After this\nordeal, he slowly begins to feel that he is\nimmortal and that nothing can kill him.\nOn returning home, by plane, he starts\nexperimenting with his life. One time,\ndeliberately crossing a road in the peak of\ntraffic, proving to himself that not even God will\nlet him die. He is introduced to another to crash\nsurvivor, Carta (Perez), who had lost her two\nyear old child in the crash, by a crash\npsychologist, in the hope that together they will\nsolve their inner problems.\nMeanwhile, his relationship with his family\nbegins to suffer, as he alienates himself from his\nwife, Laura (Rosselini), and his son, by\nconstantly flirting with death.\nThis is a complicated film with a subplot,\nmainly concerned with the crash survivors and\nthe crash psychologist. The visual atmosphere\nand cinematography is stunning, the light at the\nend of the tunnel scene is given a new less of\nlife and another when Max walks around the\nledge of a skyscraper is as nauseous as always.\nFearless is a familiar life and death\nHollywood movie, however the cinematography\nadds originality to an old plot. The soundtrack is\nthe biggest let down of the film, an intentional\nthumping sound throughout, with no apparent\nreason besides to add atmosphere (?).\nMagpie\nOut already. MGM Fulham Road, \u00a36 (\u00a33.50\nbefore 6pm, Mon-Fri).\nBackbeat\nStarring: Stephen Dorff, Sheryl Lee\nDirector: Iain Softley\nThank God this film isn't just about the Beatles'\nmusic. Sacrilegious as it may seem, I don't think\nI could sit through that for two hours. Happily\nenough, this story, as most of you ought to\nknow by now, isn't about their music. Rather\nit's about the fifth 'lost' Beatle, Stuart Sutcliffe,\nand his doomed affair (he died) with Hamburg\nphotographer Ingrid.\nThe 'period' is evoked very well and the\nperformances aren't bad either. The story is also\npretty interesting, while the music in the film is actually rather enjoyable. The movie's worth\nwatching just for the extraordinary Macca\nlookalike and John Lennon's( as played by Ian\nHart) acerbic wit. Highly recommended.\njk\nOut already.

    "content": "Reviews 15\nHigh Class Weir And ASteep Rake\nComposer Judith Weir's first theatrical work, King\nHarold's Saga, was a grand opera in three acts for\nsolo soprano, of some twelve minutes' duration.\nBlond Eckbert, an ENO commission and Weir's third full-length opera, lasts an hour and a half but\nis clearly related to her earlier small-scale chamber\npieces. In complete contrast to Birtwistle's Gawain, a Royal Opera House commission\nrevived a few weeks ago, Blond Eckbert, seems as\nif it were meant for a much more intimate\nenvironment: Weir uses a full-sized orchestra\nsparingly and only four singers are required.\nThe principal character, the reclusive Eckbert,\nis married to Berthe, a woman with a mysterious\nchildhood. Eckbert kills his best friend Walther in\na hunting accident and is consumed with guilt. He\nleaves home, and in the course of his wanderings,\nlearns that his wife is in fact his half-sister. The\nmusic is subtle, tuneful and varied - I'd like to\nhear it again. For an idea of what to expect, you\ncould try Weir's excellent The Consolations of\nScholarship, a twenty minute chamber opera\navailable on CD from Kensington Central\nLibrary. In Blond Eckbert, she has enough ideas\nnot to need to take refuge in obfuscation and a strong personal style that can incorporate to good\neffect things like the deliberate nod towards\nWagner at the beginning of the hunting scene. (A moving passage: Walther unconcernedly collects\nfalling leaves while Eckbert's neon crossbow-bolt\nglides across the back cloth.) Music Director Sian\nEdwards conducts.\nAlso at the Coliseum there's time to catch one\nof the last three performances of Julia Hollander's new production of Tchaikovsky's Eugene\nOnegin. The young cast of excellent singers is led\nby Peter Coleman-Wright in the title role and\nincludes Bonaventura Bottone's superb Lensky. I should mention, however, that I was lucky\nenough to be in the fifth row of the stalls; the\nun forced acting which I found so involving may\nseem less so from, say, the gallery. The production is in the same vein as the recent ROH staging: elegant but not wildly original.\nIn case you're thinking life is all comp li Eugene Onegin (Peter Coleman-Wright) and Tatyana (Cathryn Pope) in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin\nment ary seats for us freeloading Felix hacks, let\nme say that I was unable to get press tickets for\nOpera Factory's new production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress at the Queen Elizabeth Hall.\nBut, such is my sense of duty towards you, the\nreadership, that I went anyway. WH Auden's libretto, based on Hogarth's series of etchings,\ncharts the decline of the susceptible Tom\nRakewell, who is lured away from his fiancee,\nAnne, into a life of debauchery by the smooth-talking Nick Shadow, who turns out to be none\nother than Old Nick himself. To make sure we get\nthe bit about the debauchery, Opera Factory pull\nno punches in the episode that leads to Tom's undoing - literally in this case. Looking like a youthful Malcolm McLaren in the first spasms of\nstrychnine poisoning, Mark Tucker's Tom is\nunable to keep his head, let alone his boxer-shorts, amid the jiggling tits and lacerated fishnets\nof the outrageous brothel scene.\nThese and other distractions, including quite a lot of stage noise, may not make this an ideal\nproduction for a full appreciation of the music\n(although Mary Plazas sings Anne beautifully),\nbut the staging is so inventive and the\nperformances delivered with such energy and\ncommitment, that the effect is ultimately moving\nand thought-provoking. And if you sit by an aisle\nin the stalls you might get a doughnut. It's not\ncheap though - even a standby is \u00a312 (ouch). You\ncould try turning up at five to seven and haggling.\nPatrick Wood\nThe Coliseum. Tube: Leicester Square. 071 836\n3161. The Queen Elizabeth Hall, South Bank\nCentre.

In such\na vein, the classic 'How To Maximise Your Kill\nCount' is hopefully tongue-in-cheek with its call\nof \"gotta get three, if you want to be a massacre\nmessiah\", but with these guys you're never quite\nsure. (6)\nIn for a father, in for a son is a call in favour\nof Jeff Buckley, son of tragic star Tim. With his\nlate father's masterpiece, 'Live At The\nTroubadour 1969' reissued this year, Jeff\ncertainly gets my vote for taking the bull by the\nhorns. His four-track mini-album, Live At Sin-E, points to big things as Jeff tears his way\nthrough 'Je N 'en Connais Pas Le Fin', which\nwas an Edith Piaf slow burner, amongst others.\nAcoustically clean grit and a bared soul are\nmuch in evidence, but patches of atonal shrieks\ndo make this slightly too introverted in parts,\nbut with his pedigree, boy you could be\nsomething special. (6)\nSkipping merrily northwards, the final album\ntakes us into the civilised nation which is\nCanada. Last time I heard of Courage of Lassie\nwas five years ago when they were being touted\nas breakthrough material with the likes of\nHalfway to Eddie's and Crime and the City\nSolution. Their long pregnant third album, This\nSide Of Heaven had finally arrived and a delicate flower it is.\nDrawing on Canadian traditions such as\nreverting to French for the doom laden 'Pour\nToi Mon Amour', Courage of Lassie manage to\nshape a meaningful collection of songs which\nare vaguely comparable to the McGarrigles in\nstyle and context. The aforementioned 'Pour\nToi...' is the best as a lover progressively\nacquires objects for his love: birds, flowers and\nheavy chains ? before losing his soul in mythical\nfolk style. The only catch is a rather clique d eco-disaster song 'The Rain Forest Falls'. The\nfolk ies' equivalent of rock's drug abuse song\nhangs heavy in an otherwise intelligent album. (7)\nUntil next week. The question that remains;\nIs it better to burn out than fade away? Tintin\nLisa Germano\nHappiness\nAfter producing one of the best EPs of the year\nso far with 'Inconsiderate Bitch', there was a certain appetite in the air come the UK release\nof Lisa Germano's album. So is the smell of\nBisto better than the cow's dripping haunches?\nMaybe. Lisa fits the 4 AD pigeon hole too\nwell. It's a beautifully packaged album, she's a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist, specialising in\nviolins, and her music verges on the kooky with\nthe occasional burst of dry wit. Back to the\ngravy. The main trouble is that the best tracks\nwere on the EP, which leaves the remaining\neight being something of a lost opportunity.\nThat's not to say that this is anything less than\nsatisfying, only slightly fey.\nTo that meat.'Cowboy' is a slow steel pedal\nthrough the macho stetson s that most men seem\nto wear while pretending that they never shed a tear. And 'The Dresses Song', \"you make me\nwant to wear dresses\", is in its own way a brave\nreversal of muscle bound feminism before the\ndelicate 'Darkest Night Of All' breaks the\nalbum to an end. 'Happiness' is pleasant and\nclever, but I just wish she'd put her foot down\nand break through to low power pop rather than\ngetting stuck in the limits of high class 'art'. (6)\nA living legend in the dry winds of Texan song\nwriters, Townes van Zandt cuts a lean figure in\nthe majesty of the Union Chapel. A man, a guitar and a head full of beauty, he came and\nconquered for over two hours. The master of the\ntalkin' blues did both and made us laugh with\nstories as long and thin as the fingers which\nplucked out the rhythm of the saints.\nLike the one about the friend who was buried\nand then had to be dug up again because he had\na pawn ticket for a guitar in his suit pocket.\nAnother departed soul's end was recorded on\nan s a phone. \"Coco, this is the sound of a broken\nheart - BANG!\" As Townes smiles wryly to\nhimself he ends: \"I can tell you this because Rex\nand Blaze are here tonight...somewhere.\" I look\nup into the darkness of the church's roof and he\nM''im. it lH HH ti imu* Blur\nParklife\nA four-headed Brit machine, back to basics.\nBlur shake like Madness meeting clever lyrics\non a postcard from 'Magic America'. All things\nbright; red, white and blue, or is that red, white\nand Blur! Pennyroyal tea? No, only earl grey\nwill slide down the gullets of the lads down the\nfun pubs, laughing, working, going down to\nSouthend for a 'Bank Holiday'.\nTurn on the TV, see sex, see love on channel\n44. In jumps Damon; \"Cut down on your\npork life,\" he hurls. Get some exercise, go\njogging, round and round and round and round.\nOr just get a taxi, down the high street, past the\ntraffic lights, ticking meters, police, dustmen,\na argh' A Debt Collector'. 'London Loves' its\nown. London the urban collective collects Blur\ninto its arms. A large part of this record will\nalways be in a little part of England, sitting in\n'Clover Over Dover', by the white cliffs. 'To\nThe End', 'This Is A Low'.\nA patriotically hyperactive reviewer? After\nhearing 'Parklife' a couple of times - yes. If you\ntoo want to be immersed in a culture as warm and\ncomforting as village beer, they can serve it up,\noverflowing. The boys from Blur remain truly,\nmadly, deeply, traditionally, greatly, British. (7)\ncould be right. Their memories are very much\npart of the present as Townes wanders into\n'Rex's Blues'.\nThere was also history in his song credits.\nWhen he says \"I wrote this one for Janis Joplin\"\nor, \"when I was playing with Lightin Hopkins\"\nyou know that the craftsman has learnt with the\nbest. And the songs themselves, are stories of\ngambling, rambling and meeting no-one on the way.\n'Tecumseh Valley', maybe the lowest song\nof a fist full of blues, makes us holler and\nTownes reels out some more troubadour magic -'Loretta', 'Kathleen' and 'The Catfish Song' to\nend. Except he returns to play out the 'Buckskin\nStallion Blues'. \"If love can be and still be\nlonely, where does that leave me and you...?\"\nEnthralled.\nTownes van Zandt\nhe wore his gun outside his pants for all the honest world to feel\n\n"

You\ncan contact me, Paula, on ext 3256.\nDear Felix,\nWe are writing to make a public protest at the\nconditions in Holbein and Willis Jackson house.\nThere are two main problems we would like to\nraise: the amount of kitchen space in Willis\nJackson and the pitiful lack of common room\nspace for the use of both halls.\nAt present there are only two kitchens in\nWillis Jackson. There are about four cookers,\nfour fridges and four freezers to share between\nabout 80 residents. How would you like to share\nyour fridge with about 20 others? It is also no\nsurprise that food goes missing when so many\npeople use the same facilities.\nThere is no common room in Holbein House.\nWhen this 'showpiece' hall was renovated last\nyear the powers that be decided, in their infinite\nwisdom, that a common room wasn't necessary\n(you can cram more students in and get more\nmoney). Instead they decided that the residents\nof Holbein should be allowed to use the\ncommon room in Willis Jackson. This idea may\nhave worked except for one little thing: the\ncommon room in Willy J isn't big enough to\nswing a cat in. You can fit about 20 people into\nthe common room and no more. There is no\nother room where people can go and no study\nroom.\nHow can a room big enough for 20 cater for\nthe social life of 180 residents of both Holbein\nAND Willis Jackson? This, to be quite frank, is\na joke and not a funny one at that. All of the\nsocial events that have occured in the hall have\nbeen blighted by this lack of space. The result is\nthat the residents do not interact fully as one\nwould expect. This cannot be good for new\nstudents away from home for the first time.\nYou may be thinking why no one has\ncomplained until now. In fact, we have been\ncomplaining. IC Union Housing Committee has\nbeen made aware of the problem and we are told\nthey have raised this point before with people\nsuch as the Rector and the Director of Estates.\nHowever, nothing has been done yet. All we\nhave heard so far is that College thinks the best\nsolution is for there to be only ONE common\nroom in all of Evelyn Gardens! What does that\nmean for us? Will we now be expected to go\nacross to Fisher Hall or Southwell? Is College\ntelling us that these halls have so much common\nroom space that they can fit ALL of Evelyn\nGardens into them with no problems at all? Is\nthat a pig flying over there?\nIt seems to us that the normal means of\ncomplaining about these problems are not being\nlistened to by College. Any changes that do\noccur will be too late for this year's residents.\nMany of us feel that the facilities provided are\ninadequate and we would not wish this to\nhappen to next year's residents. Indeed, some\neven think that they should write to their schools\nand recommend that students do not come to\nImperial. Maybe this letter will change that.\nYours faithfully,\nThe residents of Holbein and Willis Jackson\nHouse\nNI ON if IR Breakspear's \u00a31 .50\nFlowers IPA \u00a31 .24\nBoddingtons \u00a31 .35\nTheakston's \u00a31 .30\nOld Peculiar \u00a31 .60\nSmile's \u00a31 .40\nNewport Nobbier\n(from Monday)\nState of the art equipment ensures each pint is of\nthe very highest quality, and in order to maintain\nour high standards, some of the above ales may\nnot be available from time to time.

    "content": "News 3\nCampus Trials Rejected\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nSerious offences such as rape and\nsexual assaults should always be handled by the police, according to an\ninterim report published over Easter.\nA task force from the Committee\nof Vice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) produced the report. The\ntask force was set up last November\nto investigate student disciplinary\nprocedures following the acquittal\nof Austen Donnellan, a King's College student accused of raping a fellow student.\nBoth King's College and the\nfemale student in question wanted\nto avoid police involvement, preferring to resolve the matter internally.\nBut Donnellan insisted on a court\nhearing, and the result attracted\nwidespread press criticism of the\ncollege's handling of the case.\nThe report defends the college's actions, stating that it would be\nimpractical for universities to\nrestrict themselves solely to academic offences. According to the\nreport the criticisms of King's involvement of the case were \"sim-pli stic\", but it did accept that the\nmore serious offences must be\nreferred to the police.\nThe existing codes of student\ndiscipline do not define the limits of\na university's authority in such\ncases and the report recommends\nthat clear procedures should be\ndrawn up. \"In short, we believe it is\nnot for the victim/complainant to\ndetermine that the matter should be\nhandled internally rather than externally\" the report states.\nIt also recommended that universities should not pursue complaints\nof rape where the accused had\nalready been acquitted in a criminal\ncourt. This is in keeping with the\nlegal principle of double jeopardy\nwhich forbids a second trial of a defendant who has already been\ntried once.\nThe interim report has now been\nreleased for consultation, prior to\nthe final report which is due to be\npublished early this summer.\nPhysics Student Suspended\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nA first year Physics student has\nbeen suspended until the end of the\nacademic year for anonymously\nharassing a female student.\nThe student sent anonymous and\nharassing messages to the female\nstudent for a period of over two\nmonths. The messages were sent by\nboth electronic mail and by handwritten notes.\nThe electronic messages could\nnot be easily traced as they came\nfrom more than one source. The\nstudent had them sent by fellow\nplayers in a multi-player computer\ngame, as well as sending them\nusing other students' accounts.\nAfter a College Disciplinary\nhearing on 29th March, the student\nwas suspended for the misuse of\nCollege computer facilities and for\nsending the messages. He has also\nbeen banned from using College\ncomputer facilities. This includes\nuse for academic purposes.\nBecause the student used other\npeople's passwords to gain access\nto their accounts, he could have\nbeen prosecuted under Section 1 of\nthe Misuse of Computers Act 1991.\nThe maximum sentence for this\ncrime that a court could impose is\nfive years imprisonment.\nIC Pare\nLaunch\nA new centre for promoting cooperation between research and industry is to open at Imperial College.\nIC Pare will be launched on 5th May by Professor Sir John\nCadogan.\nThe centre's director will be\nProfesor Barry Richards.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 7\nThe Currency of War\nThe yellow dot failed to blink again; cruelly\nextinguished to be replaced, in time, by the\nflame of a gentle candle in a distant church. A successful hit was confirmed by the computer\nthrough the voice of a dark-eyed se duc tress. Sam\nwrinkled his forehead and, trying to smooth it\nback into shape with his right hand, issued his\norders.\nThe textbook response started in a complicated evasive manoeuvre followed by\ntarget acquisition and ended waiting into the last\npicosecond to react. The manual reduced this to\na single command that the computer reduced to\nan involuntary duty.\n\" A long haul, Sir?\" queried the docking\nattendant as Sam passed on his return. Giving\nhis usual smile Sam nodded, heading for the bar;\nhe seldom changed out of his grimy flight\nclothes. The bar maid, as always, took his\nhelmet from the bar top and mutely exchanged it\nfor a drink. He had only twice heard her speak\nand, although age veiled his memory, he felt\nsure she had the voice of his flight computer.\nTaking his drink, Sam scanned the faces in the\nbar. Through the haze of pluto nite visors, an\nantipathy of young men stared back.\n\"How's the war going?\" asked Jack as Sam\napproached his table.\n\"You ask me? I only fight it.\" The reply came\nwithout a taint of humour.\nJack was around sixty years old and what\nremained of his hair was rapidly greying. When\nnot flying, he drank \"because a man needs to\noccupy his hands when he can't fly\". Besides\nhaggard looks and roughly equal ages, he and\nSam shared peculiar status as the two most\nunlikely people in that bar.\n'...half of the men you\nmeet here... won't survive beyond one,\nmaybe two sorties.\"\nAmid the clean-cut, muscular young\nimmortals of TA16 flight group, the old men\nlooked more likely to be bussing tables than\nclaiming the highest kill ratios. They sat together\nin easy silence, overhearing the loud bravado of\nyounger men discussing flight tactics,\nillustrations given with palms that cut attack\nformations through a sweaty soup of testosterone.\nA group of four guys and three women came\nand sat at an adjacent table. Sam and Jack paid\nthem little attention, as the same show available\nto the girls at any of twenty or so other tables\nhad begun. The group eventually stirred, moving\non to a club, or perhaps straight to mutually\nsatisfying sex. One of the girls made an excuse\nand the others left before her. Now alone at the\ntable, she finished her drink and began readying\nherself to move on. Doing so, she caught Jack's eye and smiled.\n\"Busy day?\" was her polite enquiry as she\nbrushed past their table.\n\"Banal and fruitful,\" Jack replied, as he stood\nto get another drink. Then, in the momentary\nhope shared by all balding sixty year olds that\nthis might be the myopic nymphomaniac all\nother balding sixty year olds profess to have\nmet, he asked if she'd care for a drink. To his\nsurprise she agreed.\nMistaking the grime under Sam's fingernails\nand the grease in his voice, she asked, \"So,\nyou're mechanics with the flight team?\" Then in\na slightly more patronising tone, added: \"It must\nbe so fascinating to work on TA16.\" Maybe\nSam took no offense, or maybe his attention was\ndistracted by the imagined tumescence of a nipple through her otherwise unflattering dress.\nIn either case he replied that they both flew and\nJack, returning with the drinks, affirmed it.\nThe girl's eyes widened as she sat forward\n\"My God, you fly, you must be so...I mean it's so exciting...My God you look too...\"\nTen years of waiting in that bar, watching\nyoung male perfection bragging to its female\ncounterpart about reverse overhead split\nevasions. Ten years of watching young virgins\nentrapped by it. Ten years of young men not\nreturning from more than two missions had\nmade them bitter, angry and, although they\nwouldn't admit it, jealous. In their rage they\nlean t their chairs back, raised their heads, and\nchuckled.\nIn mock disbelief now.\n\"You believe them? You really suppose the\nairforce entrusts two million dollars' worth of\ntactical airborne perfection to us dick-smart\npilots?\"\nThe girl recoiled and the second pilot spoke.\n\"You think we, the brave few, fly through\nskies that swarm with gunfire? That we can just\nlift the nose, slam on the anchors and a Kappa 4\nintense logic missile'll just 'fly on by'.\"\nThe girl was still perplexed.\n\"Play chess do you?\"\nEven more perplexed, she said that she did.\n\"Ever played a chess computer? Ever won?\"\n\"You see it? We can't fight the battles, we\nsimply initiate the attack code to our computers\nand the other guys initiate the evasion to their\ncomputers and so on.\"\n\"Chess.\"\n\"At least half of the men you meet here night\nafter lick eris h night won't survive beyond one,\nmaybe two sorties.\"\nLeaning forward, the pilot pinched the air and\nshook it, his conviction suddenly finding some\nshape.\n\"They think like you, they believe they'll still\nfly the planes. Maybe they suppose they're faster\nthan computers, or that they've thought of some\nnew manoeuvre. Sometimes perhaps they're\nright, but on aggregate they lose.\"\n\"Checkmate.\"\nAs the irony came full circle, a bitter grin\n\"We are both the\nbounty and the currency\nof war...\" spread across the pilot's face. Initial sarcasm hid\nanger and sorrow.\n\"Oh yes and what a noble end; half the time\nwe're fighting blips on a radar screen or, if we're\nlucky, perhaps the flash and shriek of a passing\naircraft. Mostly we fight tens of miles apart,\nnever seeing the charred corpse or the moment\nwhen gimlets replace our prey's living eyes. We\nwon't even feel the pain of our own end: logged\na hit, cremated and our atoms scattered into the\nbriny before the computer completes a million\ncycles or the breath of a scream is squeezed\nfrom our lungs.\"\n\"Isn't this the logical conclusion of\ntechnological warfare: san it is ed, virtual war?\"\nA reverent hush befell the three until, like\nsneezing in a sermon, the girl spoke.\n\"You'll do this again tomorrow; the plane\ncould fly itself, but you'll go out and fly it again\ntomorrow. Why?\"\nSatisfied now, a convert made, the final\nsecret can be delivered.\n\"Because life and sacrificial death are the\nstuff of war. When the pretensions of honour\nand courage are removed, it is lives that are\nexchanged, the peoples that are won. Today, on\nthe bloodless shrink wrapped battlefield, the\nparadox is clear, we are both the bounty and the\ncurrency of war.\"\nLacuna\nIf you have any short stories, please drop them into Felix\n\n"
