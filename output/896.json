    "content": "Proof that Imperial College engineers can build a car that can\nreach Kenya overland and rally with the best in Egypt...\nThe Adventures of Boris\nThis is a story of everyday mechanical\nengineering graduates who decided to do\nsomething different. They wanted\nadventure, and one of them, Mark Sealy,\nwanted to build a car. A plan was\nhatched to attempt the drive from\nBirmingham to London and on across the\nSahara in just three months.\nThe team of eight included graduates\nfrom Imperial College such as Martin\nBaker and Trevor Power who apparently\ngained a reputation in City & Guilds\nMotor Club, but had never before\ndesigned or built a vehicle for such a demanding journey. Mark used mainly\nLada mechanical s in a custom tubular\nsteel chassis but incorporated a Jaguar\nrear-axle and a novel cross-linked\nsuspension system to help ride the dunes.\nThe four-wheel-drive vehicle, christened\n'Boris', was completed and set off on its\nfirst journey through France without\nproper trial, along with two production\nLadas.\nBirmingham to Nairobi\nCrossing into Morocco via Gibraltar, the\nlure of the Sahara became real. In Algeria\nthey stocked up with 156 gallons of\npetrol and 37 gallons of water. After a final bath and game of cricket, they set\noff, navigating by dead reckoning using\n1:1 million maps. This technique is\nneither accurate in distance nor direction,\nbut following the tracks of other Saharan\ntraffic led them to a French Foreign\nLegion fort where the local gendarme \"\nclaimed he was the one who had found\nMark Thatcher!\nAt Tamanrasset, in the lunar landscape\nof the Hoggar Mountains, they camped\nwith a guard by the vehicles. Thorn trees\nprovided shade on the way to Agadez but\nalso caused many punctures. Reaching\nNiger offered the chance to replenish\nsupplies and witness a camel race. From Niger they headed through war-torn\nChad, crossing fast across the powdery\ncrust of Lake Chad to the capital\nNdjamena. Here there is a crossing to the\nCentral African Republic and a 'road' to\nits capital Bangui. Crime is rife and the\nCatholic Mission offered a haven to camp\nand enjoy a Christmas meal. Meat is\ngenerally avoided by travellers but a feast\nwas prepared with some very fresh\nchickens. The trans-African highway\nthrough Zaire is impassable during the\nrainy season and many roads are only\nopen six to seven months of the year.\nThey suffer badly through heavy truck\ntraffic\u2014some pot-holes are reputedly deep\nenough to swallow a truck when they fill\nup with rain. Through this terrain the\nteam often had to drive 12 to 14 hours a day to keep on schedule and sleep out in\nMosquito nets in makeshift camps.\nDespite losing a number of teeth in the\nrear differential, Boris provided a match\nfor the most demanding roads and the\nLadas disproved their many critics.\nThe prize at the end of this stretch is\nthe beautiful Ruwenzori Mountains and\nfrom Rwanda it is literally downhill all\nthe way to Tanzania and the Masai Mara plains on the floor of the Rift valley in\nKenya. The final goal of many over landers is to climb Mt Kilimanjaro. At\n5,895m it is one of the highest peaks that\ncan be climbed without oxygen.\nHowever, you do need guides and to pay\nabout $100 to enter the surrounding\ngame park\u2014the team having to auction\nsome of their equipment. In five days\nthey completed the climb and then\nheaded for the coast where Boris was\nshipped back in a container to be\noverhauled after the 8,000 miles for the\nnext adventure.\nRally of the Pharoes\nNot content with proving the design,\nMark set about fitting inboard disks,\nhybrid suspension and a230 bhp 4.3 litre\nV8 into Boris and getting him ready for a more competitive test of endurance, the\nPharoes Rally\u20143,500 miles through the\nEgyptian desert in ten days. They were\nthe only British entry, the only soft-top\nand the only special, others possibly\ndissuaded by the S6,500 entry fee. The\nrace proved eventful, Boris crashing on\nthe second day and the chase vehicle\nlater hitting a donkey, but a brave finish\non the tenth day proved that the team\ncould compete with the best.\nThe Boris team will be presenting their\nadventures at future meetings of the\nInstitution of Mechanical Engineers.\nCheck the Engineer's News for details.\nFELIX HEALTH WARNING:\nCROSSING THE SAHARA USING THIS METHOD MAY SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH.\n\n"

    "content": "'The War Comes Home\nThe Home 'Office has given an Iraqi\nstudent at Imperial College twenty-eight\ndays to leave the United Kingdom. The\nstudent in question sent his passport off\nin October, for what should have been an\nautomatic renewal of his annual visa. He\nheard nothing from the Home Office for\nfour months until last Saturday when he\nreceived notice to quit the country.\nThe letter from the Home Office\nImmigration and Nationality Department\nread as follows, '... your stay has been\nextended to 28 days after the date of this\nnotice. If you do not wish to appeal, you\nshould leave the United Kingdom by that\ndate.' The letter was stamped '20th February'.\nThe student has made the decision to\nappeal, and has sought legal advice. The\nCollege Authorities have pledged their full\nsupport. Mr Peter Mee, the College\nRegistrar, has written two letters on his\nbehalf, one to the solicitor, co-ordinating\nthe appeal, and the other to the\nimmigration department at the Home Office. In the letters, Mr Mee demanded\nan explanation for the apparently\nunjustifiable deportation action. On behalf\nof the College authorities, he said 'We\nwill support him as strongly as we can.'\nThe student said that the whole affair\nwas having \"a severe effect on (his) work'\nand that he wanted 'to stay in the\nCountry long enough to finish (his)\ndegree'.\nFelix respects the anonymity of the\nstudent, for reasons of family and\npersonal security.\nCCU Results\nThe results of the C CU elections are as\nfollows. The new City and Guilds\nPresident is Tim Proctor ( by only two\nvotes), the vice-President is Lucia\nClipstone and Honsec is Naill Davies.\nAngela Criesson is the new RCS\nPresident, Richard Murr ray is the vicePresident and Simon Gibbons is Honsec.\nThe RS M hustings are not until the 12th March. The RS M is currently riding a high\nafter their surprise victory in the Bottle\nMatch, the annual rugby match with the\nCamborne School of Mines. The RSM won\nthe football and ladies hockey but lost\nmen's hockey and squash, also against\nCamborne.\nPresident in\nCourt\nWestminster Council has summoned\nUnion President, Paul Shanley, to court\nfor the non-payment of his poll-tax. Mr\nShanley said he was not sure what course\nhe would pursue but was particularly\nunhappy about the \u00a326 court costs he\nwould incur. He did not feel that he was\nprepared to go to prison over the matter.\nMr Shanley added that he felt 'gutted'\nand exclaimed '..long live Lady Porter!'.\nLady Porter is a staunch Conservative\nand heads Westminster Council.\nICU Elections\nCandidates presently standing for the\nSabbatical posts of Imperial College Union\nare as follows:\nPresident\nZoe Hellinger\nSpenser Lane\nMichael Newman Deputy President\nJonathan Griffiths\nHonorary Secretary\nSteve Farrant\nFelix Editor\nAdam Harrington\nMonday 25th February - Kuwait Independence Day.

This should have been 28\npages long, but due to unfortunate timing\ninvolving us and paper suppliers, we\ndidn't have enough paper. Even worse, it\nisn't anybodies fault, so there's no\npotential for a good rant.

The follow-up to\nthe article about comics (which was\nexcellently written...) will be printed next\nweek, as will the second part of 'Zen\nLawyer', and the new columns (the diary\nand the boring lecture forum). As for that\ncat, see below...\nHi ho, hi ho, it's off to...?\nYet more new stuff. Starting next week\nthere will be a semi- regular section\ninvestigating the views of Imperial\nstudents towards important issues, both\nwithin college and without. It takes the\nform of a survey, wherein random\nstudents will be asked a question about a specific subject, and the answers will be\npublished. If you are quizzed, you will be\nasked whether or not you mind having\nyour name and/or photo used, which is\ntotally up to you. The first survey was\nrun with the question 'Are you going to\nvote in the ICU sabbatical elections?'.\nShould be fun...\nNext comes an experiment.\nTraditionally Felix does not publish fiction\nor poetry, as these have been the domain\nof Phoenix. However, Phoenix is only\nproduced sporadically (about once a year), and is very under publicised. Thus\nFelix will now be open to the publication\nof fictional material.

    "content": "Richard Lyle writes about the delights of\nIntriguing Indonesia\nStone relief of Ramayana, Borobuder\nI can distinctly remember it was not until\nthe aeroplane touched down at the\nSukarno-Hatta International Airport,\nJakarta, that I thought 'this is it\u2014the\npoint of no return!' As I took a deep\nbreath, my heart was definitely pounding\nfaster than usual\u2014partly due to fear of\nthe unknown and partly with excitement\nas to what lay ahead of me in the next\nseven weeks. As it turned out I had the\ntime of my life!\nThe charm of travelling anywhere on a budget is the contact you have with the\nindigenous people. Nowhere is a better\nplace than Indonesia in this respect for\nthe people are extremely friendly and\ncourteous\u2014they also love the sight of a traveller. In some of the more remote\nplaces that I visited I became an instant\nsensation with the local children as they\nall chanted their 'hello misters' and\nenergetically waved at me. Some of the\nmore mature people, that I encountered\nwere eager to practice their coarse\nbroken English on me. On one bus\njourney the first few words of a young\nman who had placed himself by my side\nwere, 'Gary Lineker, World Cup, England\nteam very good!' I had a very\nenlightening conversation with him on\nthe World Cup much to the amusement\nof a captive audience of onlookers.\nWhilst travelling in Indonesia on a shoestring, the primary mode of transport\navailable to the traveller is the bus and\nthis is an excellent place to view and\ncome in contact with some of the native\npeople. The bus may come in many\nshapes and sizes from modern air-conditioned coaches down to beaten up\nthree-wheeler be mos that are found in\ncities.\nAfter just a few short rides on the bus\nnetwork I got the distinct impression that\nwhenever I chose to take the bus so did\nthe rest of Indonesia as well! These\ncrowded vehicles carry hordes of people,\nof all ages, complete with their shopping\nand produce as well as many of their\nanimals. 1 clearly remember being rudely\nawoken, in the early hours of the\nmorning, by an extremely vivacious\ncockerel hailing the start of a glorious\nnew day\u2014just one of the many perils of\ntravelling on an overnight bus! You also\nneed nerves of steel too! All Indonesian\nbus drivers seem to be equipped with\nlead-lined boots to ensure that they can\npress the accelerator fully to the floor as\nthey take part in the Grand Prix that\ndaily adorns Indonesia's network of roads.\nAs their buses hack at full speed through\nthe countryside they pay very little\nregard to pedestrians and even less\nregard for other traffic on the road.\nCountless are the number of times that I glanced out of the front window only to\nbe transfixed by the sight of an equally\nfast and large bus streaming towards us\non the same carriageway only to pull in\nfront of the vehicle it was overtaking\nright at the last moment\u2014and when I say\nlast I mean last!\nJava happened to be my first\nintroduction to the Indonesian way of life,\nthe cheap, diverse and very tasty food\nand fruits and, as with most Southeast\nAsian countries, the system of bartering\nfor many items, such as souvenirs and\ntravel. I also saw many spectacular\nancient stone temples, such as the one at\nBorobudur which has been acclaimed as\nthe eighth wonder of the world. It also\ncontains some of the most beautiful\nscenery in the archipelago.\nGazing out of the bus window, as I did\non numerous occasions, I would be\nconfronted with a sea of green terraced\nrice paddies bordered by tall majestic\ncoconut palms. Every now and again a smoking volcano, its tall towering cone\nreaching for the sky, would loom into\nview providing something else for me to\nstare at.\nHaving manic ally rushed through Java\ntrying to see everything and anything ti\nwas time to spend a few relaxing days in\nUbud, central Bali. I especially wanted to\nsample some of the renowned Balinese\nculture and my first introduction came in\nthe form of a Temple ceremony. On arrival at the ornately decorated temple I could clearly see where the other tourists\nhad gathered, all wearing their batik\nso rong s and temple scarves (as a mark of\nrespect to the Balinese people). I settled\nmyself down in amongst them and\nfeasted my eyes on what lay before me.\nDecorations hung from every available\nspace and Balinese woman, immaculately\nturned out were to-ing and fro-ing,\ncarrying on their heads tall stacks of\nbeautifully arranged fruits and flowers.\nAfter a short while, the festivities kicked\noff with a dance known as the Topeng\n(literally mask dance). The musical\naccompaniment was in the form of a Bali\nGamelan, the instrument of which consist\nmainly of drums and cymbals, which give\nthe music a distinctly crashing sound. As\nthe night progressed I wandered to\ndifferent corners of the temple to witness\nother events such as offerings being laid\nout to the gods. All in all it was wholly\nunlike any other religious ce ref non y1 had\never seen anywhere in Europe, but it was\na most interesting occasion. My evening\nwas rounded off by a brief encounter\nwith one of those much-loved and ever-ubiquitous tropical creatures\u2014the\ncockroach. On the be mo home I was\nsitting in my seat minding my own\nbusiness when I felt a tickling sensation\non my leg. As I looked down to\ninvestigate my worst horror was\nrealised\u2014peering up at me, seemingly\ngrinning was an enormous orange and\nblack cockroach. From that point on the\njourney was marked by sudden jolts of\nmy body and subdued screams every\ntime I felt a tickling around my legs,\nmuch to the amusement of some\nAustralian girls who were seated behind\nme!\nPenelokan, situated in the Northern\nmountains of Bali, has to be the place\nwhere I have witnessed one of the most\nawe-inspiring sunrises in my life.\nI had met this English blok e whilst\ntravelling on the be mo up to Penelokan.\nWhen we arrived at the village, situated\non the crater rim of an ancient extinct\nvolcano, the view was breathtaking.\nLooking down into the valley from our\ncliff-top terrace, the crater floor spread\nout before us marked by two distinct\nfeatures\u2014a serene volcanic lake and\nadjacent to it Mount Batur. We were\napproached by some local boys, who wanted to guide us to the summit of\nMount Batur the following morning,\nassuring us that the sunrise was not a sight to be missed. We decided that we\nwould see it but did not need to pay for\nthe services of a guide to find out way to\nthe top\u2014how wrong we were!\nBy evening time we had managed to\nrecruit a couple of Dutch girls to join us\non our expedition the following morning,\nexplaining to them that we would have\nno problems climbing Mount Batur.\nAt 3.30am, my mind and body still not\nsure what was going on, 1 found myself\nsitting in the back of an open-top VW jeep, the cold night air rushing through\nmy hair, speeding down into the crater\nvalley. Whilst preparing to set off for the\ntwo hour uphill hike in the dark, it\nmaterialise d that I was the only one to\nhave brought a torch\u2014to find our way in\nthe pitch darkness. As we began the\nclimb we soon realised how disabled we\nwere with 'one eye' to see where we\nwere going. Not surprisingly we soon lost\nthe right path and ended up clambering\nup a very steep valley of loose volcanic\nrock.\n12\nWhen the sky began to lighten the\npeak was definitely out of the question as\nwe were only a third of the way up. As we perched our weary bodies oh the\nsteep s cree we settled down to a magnificent light show hosted by nature:\nout of the darkness came a faint orange\nglow which gradually became stronger\nand more intense. Suddenly the sun\ninched out from behind a rocky slope to\nour left. As it did so, a bank of thick\nwhite mist flooded in front of us, only to\nbe brilliantly illuminated a fluorescent\norange-red by the sun. Further cloud\nenshrouded the sun until it took on the\nappearance of a moon-like disc. All too\nsoon this light fantastic show was over\nand it was time to head back down to the\nhot springs in the valley. What bliss it\nwas to soak away our aches and pains in\nthe hot clear water, as the fresh morning\nbreeze washed across our faces.\nOnce I had explored the beaches,\nmountains and temples of Bali it was time\nto seek rest and solitude, thus ten days of\nmy trip were spent on the tiny secluded\ndesert island of Gili Meno. Situated about\n5km off the, north-west coast of Lombok,\nit is the middle of three tiny coral fringed\nislands (each no bigger than 3.5 square\nkilometres) and can only be described as\nparadise.\nIf good weather, empty golden beaches,\ngin-clear water and exotic coral reefs\nwith a myriad of marine life are what\nyou seek it can certainly be found here.\nI had met up with four other travellers\nand we had decided on Gili Meno\nbecause through the traveller's grapevine\nwe had heard that it was the quietest and\nmost unspoilt of the three islands. On arrival we were not disappointed as the\nplace had a most enduring charm. We checked into our bamboo beach hut at\nthe aptly named Blue Coral, and at 7,500\nRupiahs (\u00a32.50) per night including three\nmeals a day, we were set to have a great\ntime.\nBalinese statue\nTRAVEL\nStone Temple,, Java\nWe soon slipped into a routine\u2014after a day of sunbathing, slumbering and\nsnorkelling, the perfect way to round off\nthe day was to head off to the bar (a bamboo shack) at the western end of the\nisland. As we sat around chatting and\nsipping the cool Indonesian-brewed\nBintang beer, the sun would lazily sink to\na watery grave, silhouetting the palms on\nthe adjacent beach as it did so. On the\nhorizon, the distinctive cone shape of\nMount Agung, on Bali some 50km away,\nwould provide the backdrop to a magnificently lit sky of many different\npastel-shaded colours.\nUnfortunately all good things must\ncome to an end. For me that meant\nheading back to Bali to catch my flight\nhome. On my flight out of Bali I was\npresented with a most wonderful\nspectacle. As the aeroplane rapidly\ngathered height, moments after leaving\nDenpasar airport, we flew above the\nvolcano, Mou ng Agung. As I peered out\nof the tiny window, below me lay a gigantic cone rising up to a pin-like\nopening which was the crater of the\nvolcano. There was a definite feeling of\nmelancholy in my heart as my mind went\nthrough the events of the last seven\nweeks. After flying by this enthralling\nfeature we headed out to the Java sea\nand back to England.\nWhatever it is you seek, be it the rich\nand diverse culture, the spectacular sea-and land-s capes or the exotic food and\nfruits somewhere in Indonesia it is likely\nto be on offer.\n13\n\n"

If so,\nthen I would like to put in my contribution.\nIn your editorial for Felix 892 you\nexpress your annoyance at exams. I too\nhave heard the arguments for exams\u2014\nthat they provide an abstract scale\nagainst which to measure people against,\net al. This set me thinking about what the\nCollege is really for.\nAfter three years here, I have come to\nthe conclusion that it only exists to\nproduce automatons to keep our industry\n(barely) running; but, primarily, to make\nmoney. Exams provide the cheapest way\nto assess students, so profits can be\nmaximise d. Could there be any other reason?\nYours,\nThe Wizzard.\nand logic\nDear Andy,\nI do wish Athena would apply the same\nstandards to himself/herself/themselves\nas she/they/he does (do) to others.\nIssue 894 point 2: begins by s lagging off\nChristians for having arguments on a premise that the Bible is fiction. Is either\nany better than the other?\nNow let's say I want to argue\nsomething with the premise that there is\nlife after death. Athena would( I presume)\nallow me to state this (after all, there's no\nless proof than for\u2014say\u2014the fictional\nnature of the Bible). But what if I said\n'according to St Paul's first letter to the\nCorinthians...' and then stated 'there is life\nafter death'. Suddenly no good? Hmmm, novel logic.\nHowever, I do agree with point 2\u2014it's nice, ordered logic. So, Athena, practice\nwhat you preach, or stop preaching.\nYours sincerely,\nAndy Cooksley, Physics 3.\nA reply to a reply to another reply\nDear Andy,\nA reply, to a reply, to another reply, to\nyet more replies to a letter which may or\nmay not have been printed in FELIX a long time ago.\n1. Athena may not be scared enough\nnot to admit his/her/its name, but how\nabout the others who write in using\nassumed names? And even if Athena was\nscared, would he/she/it admit it? At this\npoint for the sake of continuity, I will\nrefer to Athena as the female gender as\nPallas Athena originally was.\n2) Yes, much logic included in\narguments on the letters page is flawed,\nor two-faced.\nEg. Athena writes that we would\nassume generalisations about her, (i.e. if\nshe were female, she would be a feminist)\nif her name was disclosed.\nFair enough.\nBut in doing so, she too makes a gross\ngeneralisation in that the average reader\nis 'assumption is tic'.3) With the closure by the editor of a certain topic which provoked much heated argument, Athena has kindly\nsupplied us all with a fresh, new and\nchallenging one to sink our critical teeth\ninto, i.e. the his tori city of the Bible.\nI hope Athena does more work at her\ncourse than in researching her literature,\nbecause if not, she's got quite a bit to do.\nBiblical literature is embedded in the\nfoundation of Middle Eastern history and\nas science moves forward in researching\nour past, more and more of the Bible is\nproved to be valid, if not fact.\nFifty years ago, Abraham was thought\nof as being a mythical figure, but now\nthere is more than enough archeological\nevidence to say that he lived on this\nearth. Going even further back, there is\nan incredible amount of evidence to\nsuggest that there was a flood and that\nthere is a wooden boat-like structure\nembedded in ice on Mount Ararat,\nTurkey, corresponding to the dimensions\nspecified by God to Noah when building\nthe ark.\nJesus may or may not have walked on\nwater, depending on what you believe,\nbut Athena, by declaring the Bible as\n'fiction', is most certainly walking on thin\nair.\n4) Referring not just to Athena, but\nmany more who ha v% \u00ab^rj tten in, we can\nconclude that all Chrisjjaji^ are\nunforgiving, self-right e ou o, judgemental,\nhypocritical, etc. Thinking of us (yes, I'm one too) as Victorianists is in itself\narchaic.\nYes, all of us fall for at least one of\nthese quite frequently, but that doesn't mean we are supposed to. There isn't enough time or space to deal with all of\nthem, but taking the subject of\nforgiveness, Christians are supposed to\nforgive and be compassionate, but we are\nalso charged (just as we would be\nmorally) to point out to someone when\nthey are doing something blatantly\nwrong.\nThere have been some misunderstood\nand misguided letters on both sides,\nportraying an uncaring Christian faith, of\nwhich this must be the fault only of\nourselves.\nAnother criticism of Christians writing\nin is not of quoting the Bible, but of not\ngiving a context or a reason for their\nbelief in it, or an interpretation of why the person in question might be telling us\nto do or not to do something.\n5) Agreeing with Athena's views on the\nprehensile antics of mascot ry and the\nsolutions suggested, I ask myself, is it the\nchildren who are at risk or the Union\nfunds and recriminations we should be\nworrying about?\nYours, trying to be Christlike,\nGiles Pettit, Mech Eng 1\n(A real entity!)\n20\n\n"

    "content": "Adam Harrington visited Czechoslovakia.\nPrague\nPrague has been referred to as the Paris\nof the East, ft has one or two benefits\nover Paris, one being that Prague's architecture is mostly the same now as it\nwas over a hundred years ago. The\nsecond is that it is much cheaper.\nCzechoslovakia capitulated in the\n1930's, and so its cities were not bombed\nsenseless like other European cities, and\nsince the war there has not been enough\nmoney in the country for any\ndevelopment.\nIts town centre is almost entirely\npedestrianised, because the mediaeval\nstreets are not wide enough even to\naccommodate the minute Trabant. It has\nmiles of meandering lanes weaving\nbetween beautiful houses and churches.\nThe view across the Vltava river to\nHradcany, the presidential palace on top\nof a hill, is breathtaking, especially when it is floodlit at night.\nA pedestrian bridge, the Charles'\nbridge, connects the base of Hradcany\nwith the centre of the city. All along its\nlength there are musicians, generally\nplaying traditional jazz on a variety of\nbattered instruments. Given the\nsurroundings, hours can be spent sitting\nhere, wasting time in a very pleasant\nmanner. On several evenings there were\na duo performing what I took to be\nCzech folk songs. One played bitter-sweet\noboe accompaniment to the other man's nasal singing. In all it was highly\neffective, and these two are one of my\nmost enduring memories.\nAn entire afternoon can be spent\nwatching a greengrocer's store, where\nPrague citizens wander past, notice a pineapple, or a grapefruit or something\nsimilar and amidst excited chatter, crowd\naround the window pointing at it and join\na queue already 20 people long. The\nshops are like something out of the 30's. Grocers stores are packed with cans of\nsalted fish, millimetre thickness strips of\ndry curled up cheese and lumps of stone\nmasquerading as bread. All these are\nbehind counters and have to be asked\nfor, they can't be picked up and bought\nat the exit. This means that you have to\nspeak Czech, which nobody except the\nCzechs can do. So give up buying your\nown food and go to a restaurant. There is\none called ' U Prince' in a corner of the\nold town square (Staromestske names ti) which belongs to the state, as did all\nrestaurants when I was there, though\nthings are moving so fast politically that\nthings may change soon. After a reasonable but not stunning three course\nmeal for three people, we were charged\nthe equivalent of five pounds. We assumed that this was for each, but no, it\nwas between all of us.\nThe language barrier is a problem,\nCzechs only speak Russian as well as\nA step back in time.\ntheir own language. English and German\ncome a poor third. Czechs are not by\nnature very helpful; when we were there,\na certain amount of money had to be\nchanged every day and entered on the\nvisa (no visa or money change is required\nnow - Mrs Thatcher visited President\nHavel a few days before we visited\nPrague. God knows what she did, but he\nreneged on visas). At every (state owned)\nbureau de change a different story was\ngiven as to what should be entered on\nthe visa, and in theory, if the information\nis wrong, exit from the country can be\nbarred until large amounts of money\nchange hands. There are a lot of shady\ncharacters around these bureaux\nmuttering 'Wechsel, cambio, bureau'.\nThese are illegal money changers, giving\na better rate of exchange. Since things\nare so cheap in Prague, and there is so\nlittle to buy, it is damn difficult to get rid\nof the money before you leave. Czech\nKoruny cannot be legally taken out of the\ncountry, and cannot be changed back\ninto real money once bought. The last\nday in Prague was spent buzzing around\nthe city trying to get rid of the money.\nThis is a very unusual feeling, as Iam more used to stringent economy drives.\nPrague loves its ice cream - and it's bloody good despite there being no\nchoice of flavours - and most of the\nexcess ko run y went on this.\nA word of warning. Czechoslovak\nrailways make British Rail look helpful\nand efficient. Quite definitively the worst\nrail journey I 've ever had was between\nHlavni nad raz i Prague's terminal station\n- and Nurnberg in Germany. We were\nforcibly evicted from the spartan\ncompartment into the even more spartan\nand very breezy corridor by a collection\nof overweight and copiously smoking East\nEuropeans who then continued to smoke\nin the corridor and drop fag ash on us.\nThey were in cahoots with a woman guard built like a Russian shot putter who looked like she would brook no\ncomplaint. I emerged at four in the\nmorning at Nurnberg looking like\nsomething from ' V.A rucksack is a general notice of two things:\n1. You don't have much money and are\nprobably inter-railing and so can be\ntreated like turd, as no more money can\nbe squeezed out of you if you were\ntreated nicely and\n2. As there are too many rucksack ers anyway, the more difficult your life can\nbe made, the fewer there will be next\nyear.\nConclusion - fly to Prague and fly out,\nbut for heaven's sake see it before it\nbecomes too tourist y. It is a beautiful city,\nand is worth seeing just because it is so\nutterly peculiar due to its communist past.\nFlights cost from around SI70 return, and\ncheap accommodation can be booked\nfrom Hlavni station hostel offices which only open when trains from abroad pull\nin. It would be a good idea to contact the\nCzechoslovak Embassy to check details\nbeforehand.\n18\n\n"

    "content": "Mr & Mrs Bridges\nI This film follows the course of an\nAmerican upper middle class\nmarriage during the 1930s and\n1940s. Paul Newman plays the part of the\nold fashioned, 'set in his ways', and\nsometimes pompous father just brilliantly\nand is sometimes very funny, purely\nbecause he is so stubborn.\nHis wife, both on and off screen, is\nJoanne Woodward, who is the typical\nover-caring and proud mother, plays this\npart brilliantly.\nThe film is basically concerned with how their three children, two girls and\none boy, grow up.\nThe son, played by Robert Sean\nLeonard, (the one who killed himself in\nDead Poets Society) goes from being the\nnervous young Eagle Scout through to\nbeing in the army air corps due to\nwartime excitement, and finally ending\nup taking over his father's law firm.\nThe two daughters Harriet and Ruth,\nplayed by Saundra McClain and Kyra Sedgwick, have their own troubles.\nHarriet meets Glen at University, marries\nin haste and finds out later that she can't stand her husband. Ruth, a high-spirited,\nsexually charged girl, departs for the\nartistic bohemia of New York. Other not i cable performances were by\nDr Alex Saver (Simon Callow: Amadeus,\nA Room with a View) and also by Blythe\nDanner as Grace Barron the best friend\nof Mrs Bridge.\nAll in all the film was enjoyable, but\nnot something I would deliberately go\nand see\u2014my parents would love it enough said?\nHix.\nMeet the Applegates\nF Dick, Jane, Johnny and Sally are a blue-eyed, blond haired ail-American nuclear family. Johnny\n(15) loves baseball and science. Sally (17)\nis fond of Chicken McNuggets and kisses\non the second date. Dick and Jane are\nthe perfect couple, and keep a wonderfully average house. They even\nlive in Median, Ohio.\nAll is smiley faces until decadence takes\nits toll; Dick begins to practise with his\nnamesake on his secretary and Jane finds\nout about the joys of plastic. Not to be\noutdone, Sally and Johnny get a bun in\nthe oven and turn into a dope-crazed\nmetal freak (respectively, of course).\nWhile this may sound like small\npotatoes (as opposed to the gargantuan\nrooter s of Die Kroppe) compared to an\naverage episode of Neighbours the above\nscenario takes on a happy turn for the\nworse/better when you discover that the\nApplegates are in fact amiable six foot\ncockroaches bent on cracking the cooler\nof the local nuke plant.\nThereafter much chaos ensues; Sally's one-night stand is alarmed to discover\nthat not only is she unprotected but also\ninvertebrate. Johnny's dope suppliers are\nequally alarmed to find just how high you can go and bodies start to pile up like\nextras in a Charles Bronson pic. As for\ndear little Spot the dog..\nTo add new joy to the concoction the\nmou s tachi oed Queen Bea (bad pun) shows\nup in the unlikely guise of Dabney\nColeman (what is it with him all of a sudden ?) and proceeds with an all-out\nentomological assault on the nuke plant\nin the hope that all the humans make\nway for the more resistant bug\npopulation.\nHooray ! Japanese monster, movie\nmayhem! Cooling towers glowing green !\nBanks of coloured switches exploding !\nGiant subtitled insects wading through the\ndebris in a desperate struggle for the\nfuture of the human race ! Etc !\nMeet The Applegates is a nice little\necological satire from the director of\nHeathers (if you haven't seen it you ought\nto), offering the rarely seen insect\nperspective on the human way of life.\nHave you ever stopped to consider the\ndiff fi cult y of obtaining insect pornography\nin a small American town? Or of the\nproblems involved in concealing a mummified secretary in a drinks cabinet?\nOn the vicarious side it's nice to see\ninnocents succumb to every one of the\nmajor categories of vice (donkey bugger y excepted) and the insects are very cute.\nEspecially Sally.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nQBurkina Faso's Idrissa Ouedraogo\nfirst came to the attention of the\nBritish cinema goers in 1989 with\nthe highly acclaimed Yaaba. He has\nfollowed it up with Tilai, which won last\nyear's Grand Jury Prize at Cannes.\nThe story centres around Saga, who\nupon his return to his village after a long\nperiod finds that his fiancee has been\nmarried to his ageing father. Saga feels\nbetrayed by his father, his fiancee, his\nbrother and, in fact, the whole village. He\nthen sets up his hut close to, but separate\nfrom, the rest of the village. However,\nSaga and his former fiancee later meet\nagain and make love. The villagers soon\ndiscover the 'incestuous' relationship,\nultimately leading to tragic results.\nTilai actually means 'the law'.\nOuedraogo is interested in the codes\nunder which society must live in order to\nsurvive and the consequences for an\nindividual when he or she breaks those\nrules. Saga's bro trier for example\nrecognises that Saga must accept their\nfather's decision and continue life as best\nhe can under the new circumstances.\nBoth father and son will allow no room for compromise\u2014their egoism in fact\nthreatens any order that has been created\nby the notion of 'village' or society. The\nties of honour which hold the characters\ntogether are also very strong in the film.\nThis is of course classic material for\ntragedy (one may consider the similarities\nwith the Oedipus story). Nevertheless this\nis a very African film\u2014as Ouedraogo\nsays, 'Perhaps the great Greek tragedies\nare not the only ones in the world...But\nwe have not had the chance to put ours\nin writing.'\nBut don't worry, the film isn't half as\ndry as I make out. The film is very funny\nin places, and extremely beautiful. The\nfilm makers persuaded the brilliant South\nAfrican jazz musician, Abdullah Ibrahim,\nto compose a highly evocative soundtrack\nfor the film. Ouedraogo himself\ncommunicates superbly through the\nmedium which he operates. Image and\nsound combine wonderfully, always it\nseems with the minimum of effort or fuss.\nIt all seems so simple, yet has been\nbrilliantly fabricated to produce a visually\nstunning window on a very rich world.\nI.H. \u2014 Film6 "

Since 1983 for example,\nthe number of British and Irish\ntravelling to the land 'down under' has\nmore than doubled from 1 26,880 in\n1982-83 to 256,454 in 1988-89.\nLeigh Harris and Amanda Galbraith,\nthe co-founders of the WTC, have\ndeveloped a safety package which\nassists travellers of all ages both\nworking their passage and simply\nholidaying to have a more enjoyable\nhassle-free experience.\nThis system allows travellers to\norganise a free airport pick-up and\nbook accommodation in their Australian\ndestination before leaving home. This\nis followed by a complimentary\norientation tour or Sydney Harbour\nCruise. Once in the Sydney WTC\noffice, travellers are assisted with tax\nfile number registration \u2014essential for\nworking holiday makers and medicare\ncover. WTC staff also help with job\nand flat hunting and provide a long\nterm luggage storage facility. For\npeople on the move, the WTC offers a permanent postal address and\ntelephone number from which mail and\nmessages can be held in our office or\nforwarded to the travellers next port of\ncall.\nThe first of its kind, the World\nTravellers Club, has been operating for\nover a year in Australia, ten months in\nBritain and will shortly be networking\nthroughout Australia and into Thailand\nand New Zealand.\nLife membership can be ob tian ed in\nBritain for a fee of \u00a330 for a single\nperson or \u00a350 for two people travelling\ntogether.

    "content": "What is it like to travel on the Trans Siberian Railway? Whai\nBottom Bunk to\nHas the 'openness' of glasnost opened up\nthe USSR to the independent traveller or\nare the trials and tribulations of making a journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway\nstill as great than those of living in the\ncountry?\nThe Trans-Siberian railway proper runs\nfrom Moscow to Vladivostock in the\nSoviet Far East. Travellers crossing\nSiberia have a choice of three trains. The\nfirst follows a route due east to Ka kho dka on the Pacific coast, for ferry crossings to\nJapan. The second and third routes both\nrun to Peking, one via Mongolia and the\nother taking the longer route through\nManchuria.\nAccounts of the trip range from the\nclassic work by A. I. Dmitriev-Mamanov\nGuide to the Great Siberian Railway 1900\nto a few pages in Bob Geldoff's autobiography Is that it? More informative\nguides on routes, costs, bookings and\nthings to take include Bryan Thomas'\nTrans-Siberian Handbook (\u00a38.95) to\nRobert Strauss' Trans-Siberian Rail Guide\n(\u00a36.95). Watch for the out-of-date\ninformation on Intourist in both books.\nTravel prices range widely from\ncountry to country, depending on where\nyou are prepared to embark. Intourist,\nthe sole Russian travel agent, sell one\nway tickets from Moscow to Peking for\nreported for as little as US$10, less than\nthe cost of two London day travel cards.\nIntourist operate a telephone booking\nservice from their London offices in the\nIsle of Dogs (General Enquiries on\n081-538 8600). However the 50 years\nexperience of arranging travel in the\nSoviet Union that they boast on their\nbooking forms has taught them little\nabout customer relations. They really\nknow how to put the hassle into travel.\nTheir suspicious, unhelpful attitude to\nindependent travellers was perhaps suited\nto the Brezhnev/Andropov Russia of the\n70s and 80s, but not Gorbachev's glasnost\nof today. The 'have a nice day' approach\npractised inthe newly opened Moscow\nMacDonalds is not necessary. However a little encouragement and advice about the\ndaunting bureaucracy and paper work,\nwhich such a trip still demands,would be\nappreciated.\nThe attitude of the Intourist staff in\nGlasgow and Manchester is apparently\nmore conducive to booking, but they still\nprefer to handle group travel. For the\nindependent traveller the packages and\nservice offered by the Finland based\nScandinavian Student Travel Service\n(SSTS) are more appropriate. They can be\narranged through British travel agents\nlike ST A travel. Don't be put off by the\nto make the booking through Intourist,\nbut they eliminate the frustrations\nexperienced by booking direct. All this\nhelp comes at a price. Their HelsinkiMoscow-Irkutsk-Peking tour taking 11\ndays and 10 nights costs US$1045 to\nshare a4 berth 'hard' class compartment.\nThe price includes all meals between\nMoscow and the Chinese border, a one\nday tour of Moscow with a compulsory\nnight in an expensive Intourist Hotel and\na two day tour round Irkutsk and Lake\nBaikal.\nBefore embarking it certainly seemed\nthat despite the widespread reforms of\nthe Gorbachev era, the paranoid fear and\nsuspicion of the independent traveller still\nexisted. Who would be controlling the\nUSSR, Intourist or perestroika?\nIt was a stifling ly hot afternoon at the\nend of June when the Rossiya slipped\nsilently from its siding at Yaroslavl station\non the east side of Moscow. The Intourist\nguide assigned to escort us to Irkutsk was\nPeter, a meek, slender, bearded man with\nworn out mournful eyes. He had endured\nthe Trans-Siberian Railway ten times in as\nmany years.\n'Nothing has changed...' he sighed.\n'The train is the same.... the service is the\nsame....and the food....no the food is\nworse....our economy is bad.'\naround \u00a3325 sharing a four berth\ncompartment in 'hard' class. Intourist\ndoes not arrange travel from the UK to\nMoscow. You can fly for \u00a3185 or take the\n53-hour train journey for \u00a3167. If you are\nprepared to spend two weeks in Hungary\na ticket can cost as little as \u00a327! The trick\nis to purchase a legitimate ticket in\nBudapest for about \u00a370 in order to get\nyour USSR travel documents. You then\nget a refund on this ticket, (loosing only\nabout \u00a315) and buy one of the numerous\nblack market tickets for \u00a312.\nTravelling from east to west still\nremains the cheapest direction. Tickets\nbought in Beijing and Hong Kong are\nUS$180 and US$100 in Japan. Winter\nblack market prices in Beijing have been\n'Student' name. It is designed to\nencourage students rather than\ndiscourage non-students.\nSSTS specialise in Russian and Chinese\ntravel. Through any British agent their\nfaxed response to enquiries is\ninstantaneous. The customer has a choice\nof three packages consisting of various\ncombinations of stop-overs in Moscow\nand Siberia. All trains depart from\nHelsinki. A one way flight from London\nto Helsinki is about \u00a3100. The fifty hour\ntrain journey is about the same price.\nUnlike Intourist, SSTS offer advice on\nmoney, time zones, dining on the train,\nborder formalities, stop-over itineraries\nand assistance with Russian and Chinese\nvisa applications. Ironically SSTS still have\nThe food was bad. Each meal\ncommenced with a stainless steel dish of\nwatery congealing soup sloshing up the\nhigh sides. You always had to ask what\nflavour it was. The main course was\nthe usual shrivelled square of boiled meat,\nsplodge of mash potato and scoop of\nsauer-kr aut. Dry biscuits to dunk in your\ncoffee completed each masochistic menu.\nWe were running on 'Peter time'. When he grew bored, once or twice a day he\ntold us all to put our watches forward.\nTravelling this way avoided any jet lag.\nWe reached Lake Galichskoye, 501\nkilometres from Moscow as the mid-night\nsun glowed low in the sky. I woke 690\nkilometres further on to heavy rain in\nBalezino. Wet figures fought tractors\n14\ncan be found on the way? Chris Riley found out last year.\nBeijing\nalong deeply rutted tracks, wooden huts\nsteamed in damp forests and Jail House\nRock warbled through the speakers.\nOutside the clattering train for the first\nthree days was a repetitive wallpaper of\nundulating silver birch trees. Where the\ntrain crosses the Urals in the south, they\nare barely 500 metres high and pass like\na bad join in the pattern. The entire\nhistory of Russian architecture is spread\nalong the line; from concrete\ncondominiums and filthy factories of\nPerm and Novosibirsk, to neglected\nweather-blackened houses made of planks\nand split-log huts with ground-scraping\nwindow ledges.\nAir on aG string echoed down the\ncorridor as we crossed the mighty Ka me River and passed through Perm. At1777 kilometres from Moscow we rattled past\nthe unobtrusive obelisk and entered Asia.\nWhen I woke on the third day the air\nwas thick with dandelion seeds. The train\nhad stopped at Omsk (2716km) with its\nstrawberry sellers and water melon stalls\nand 'gift shops' selling wedding\ninvitations.\nIt was going to be a hard day. Peter\nsaid so. We were crossing the Siberian\nSteppes, an area larger than France and\nresembling the Fens. It was over 30\u00b0C and the thick black soils of the steppes\nturned to a fine soot, sucked up by the\npassing train and injected in through\nclosed doors and windows. It was drawn\nmagnetically to clammy skin. Faces,\nhands and legs turned black.\nClumps of dead white 'ghost' trees\nstood alone in the swamps and small\nherds of dairy cattle grazed the plains.\nWebs of criss-crossing taut telegraph\ncables framed the shanty towns along the\ntrack. We were running three hours late,\nPeter said it would be seven hours by\nVladivostock, (not bad for 10,000km). The\nlong Ob river on its 4 0 0 0 km journey\nnorth to the Arctic Sea signalled a welcome end to the Steppes. On the\nplatform in Novosibirsk we jostled with\nthe locals to buy over-ripe, deep red\nplums.\nIrkutsk loomed large and damp on a dark drizzly Siberian Summer evening\n5191 km from Moscow. The Rossiya\nslipped into the drizzle and on to\nVladivostock four more days down the\ntrack. A broken bus splashed through the\nfloods and took us away.\nA damp day in Irkutsk allowed a sailing\ntrip on the misty waters and a tramp\nthrough a valley village on the shores.\nLake Baikal with its thick fir-tree forests\nwashed in cool mists resembled a large\nScottish loch (larger than Scotland). The\nlake is the world's oldest and deepest,\naccounting for one fifth of the world's fresh water. Back in town and for just\nover 15p that night we had front row\nseats for a Siberian performance of Swa n Lake.\nThe Moscow-Peking train, number 19,\nscooped us up the next day as it trundled\nthrough Irkutsk and round the southern\nend of Lake Baikal. As twilight came we\nheaded east and into the Khrebet\nKham an Daban foot hills of the\nMongolian frontier. The Chinese border\ndrew ever nearer on the second day out\nof Irkutsk. The silver birch were gone\nand the 'Canadian Rockies' appeared,\nsporting Swiss style Chalets, and wobbling\nover the imperfections in the mud spattered glass.\nVast grasslands of the 'South Downs'\nrolled down to the border town A Manzhouli and a welcome th rf hour\nbreak whilst the wheels were hanged.\nUntil last year, photographic this\noperation tempted indefinite sentences in\nthe hard labour camps to t',? north.\nToday Glasnost had reached Manzhouli,\nwe watched, photographed, made notes\nand swapped coins with the railway men quite freely.\nOnce across the border we stepped\nonto a wall to wall Chinese carpet of\ncultivation animated by match-stick men\nwith lampshade hats. An entirely manmade landscape met our eyes; flooded\ngolf-green rice fields coating vast open\nplains and terraced on impossible slopes.\nFrom Manzhouli, Beijing with its prickly\nheat, seven million bicycles and ten\nmillion bustling people is a day and a half\naway. Suddenly the predictable security\nof the ten day Russian tour is at an end.\nTurfed out of my cosy bunk and into an\nalien world of chopsticks and noodles,\nmandarin money changers, spitting and\nstaring, brand new old fashioned steam\ntrains and singing bicycle bells.\nThis article first appeared in TNT\nMagazine issue 839, 11 February 1991\n15\n\n"

    "content": "TRAVEL\nYou don't have to go abroad for variety\nStaffa, Mull & Iona\nThe island of Mull lies just off the west\ncoast of Scotland, and forms part of the\nInner Hebrides. It is one of the largest\nislands in the UK, and is relatively\nundiscovered by tourists, who usually\ncome on one-day coach trips. Lying to\nthe west of Mull are a whole series of\nislands. Two are mentioned in this\nfeature, Iona and Staffa.\nStaffa is a small island off Mull, and is\nstark and uninhabited. Yet this island is\nfamous for two things: its rock structure,\nand Fingal's Cave. The rock is volcanic\nbasalt, and has formed into tall vertical\n'crystals' with a regular hexagonal cross-section. The same rock structure is found\nat Giant's Causeway, in Northern\nIreland.and, as legend has it, the two\nplaces are said to be the ends of a causeway built by the Irish giant, Finn\nMac Cool. He decided that he was going\nto fight his Scots contemporary, Fin Gall,\nand to do this,he had to have a means of\ngetting there. After driving each column\ninto place, he went back to Ireland to\nrest before he attacked.\nMeanwhile, Finn Gall crossed to Ireland\nto spy out the land, and, so terrified by\nthe sleeping giant, fled back to Scotland\ndestroying the causeway behind him.\nFingal's Cave is named after that same\ngiant. It is a large sea cave, stretching\nback more than 60 metres into the cliff\nface. The walls and roof are all part of\nthe hexagonal rock formation, giving it as\nlight cathedral-like look. In good weather,\nboats can go right inside the cave, but\nnormally, access to it requires a climb\ndown the cliff-side. Boats run to Staffa\nfrom Mull and Iona, and the routes used\ngo past many uninhabited islets which are\npopulated by a whole variety of birds.\nQuite often, seals can be spotted, sunning\nthemselves along the shore.\nAlthough many people decide to 'do'\nMull and Iona on a single coach cum ferry trip from Oban, it is well worth\nspending several days on Mull itself. In\nthe north part of the island is the capital,\nTobermory, said to be the most beautiful\nharbour in the world. The island is\nmountainous, and a lot of the land\nbelongs to the Forestry Commission, and\nis rented to farmers. Fences are few, and,\nproviding you do no damage, you are\nallowed to go nearly everywhere. If you\nwant a hill-walking holiday, knowing that\nfew people will have been where you can\ngo, this is a place to visit. There are\nseveral large lochs which can be fished,\nand the whole place abounds with\nwildlife.\nThe road system in Mull is slightly\ndifferent to the rest of the UK: all but\nabout 12 miles are single track road (with\npassing places). Despite this, getting about\non Mull is not difficult, because if you\ncome up behind a slower-moving vehicle,\nthey are expected to move into let you\npast. With experience, roads on Mull can\noften be traversed faster than their single\ncarriageway mainland equivalents: you\nare rarely blocked. Traffic and population\nis light; this is one of the few inhabited\nplaces in Britain where you can go out at\nnight and not see a single artificial light\nsource, even over an extended period of\ntime.\nIf you are a historical Britain fanatic,\nthen Mull boasts two castles open to the\npublic, Duart, seat of MacLean, and\nTorosay. However, Iona will probably\nhave more interest for you since it was\nthe seat of the Columban church, from\nwhere missionaries were sent to convert\nthe pagan Picts of early Scotland. Iona\nwas the place where Columba, the Irish\nprince and abbot, came, in the sixth\ncentury, and founded an abbey from\nwhere the spiritual affairs of Scotland\nwere governed. The abbey itself (which is\nnot the 6th century original) is too\nsubservient to the tourist trade, but the\nrest of the island is visually stunning\n(when the sun shines).\nIt is worth leaving the abbey to the\ntourists, and going out to explore the rest\nof the island. One of the reasons Columba decided to settle on Iona was its beauty,\nand this remains, largely unspoiled, even\nto this day.\nFerries run to Mull from Oban in\nStrathclyde region, and from Lochaline,\nHighland region. Oban is about 100 miles\nfrom Glasgow, and about 500 miles from\nLondon. Costs are, what you make of\nthem: bed & breakfast with evening meal\non Mull is well under \u00a320 per night.\nTaking a car over to Mull is not cheap,\nbut it is worth it in terms of flexibility.\nTravel Editorial Fed up with exams and the stress of\ncollege life? Go on holiday. Much can be\ndone on a limited budget, and if you are\ndevoid of ideas, one of our features\nshould provide you with some inspiration.\nWhen I came to edit the travel features,\nI was impressed with the range and\nvariety of places students visit, and things\nstudents do, whilst on holiday. No\ntransport? Build your own car and take it\nto Africa (but do take better maps than\nthe pilots of Boris, page 11). Like trains\nand value-for-money travel? Try inter-railing, page 19. No money? Go and stay\nwith a friend somewhere in the U Kthere's plenty to see without having to\npay to get out of the country. Think\nSherfield's bureaucracy is bad? Try the\ngenuine version in China or the Soviet\nUnion (pages 8 and 9). When things go\nwrong? See the account of surgery in the\nfield on page 10. Want to see what\nEurope was like a century ago? Visit\nplaces like Prague (page 18).\nWhatever your holiday plans, it is well\nworth going to see people like ST A to\nbounce ideas around, and get them\ncosted. If you are going to another part\nof the world, it may be worth trying\nschemes such as World Travellers Club.\nThere will be a travel supplement to\nFelix later on this year, where we hope\nto print all the features that we had to\nmiss out this time; thanks to everyone\nwho submitted articles. Photographs\nshould be collected before they disappear\ninto the aether.\nRoland Flower dew Nend-a Bike\nPETER THOMAS BICYCLE\nREPAIRS\nSALES\nAND ACCESSORIES\n4-6 Effie Road\nFulham, London SW6 ITD\n071-371 $867\n\n"

    "content": "Mark Richardson toured Europe by\nInter-Railing\nLast summer I travelled around Greece\nand Italy with an inter-rail card. The free\nferry crossing offered between Patras on\nthe Peleponese and Brindisi in southern\nItaly makes this an attractive option for a route through southern Europe.\nOur first stop in Greece was the small\ntown of Litochoro at the foot of Mount\nOlympus. Most of the thousands of inter-rail ers who visit Greece go for the sun\nand historical beauty, fewer realise\nGreece is also a very mountainous\ncountry with some spectacular natural\nscenery. We stayed at the small and\nfriendly youth hostel in Litochoro which is used as a base by hikers who come to\nclimb Mount Olympus. If you want to\nattempt the climb, you can hire boots and\nmaps and also leave your rucksack at the\nhostel. We went to Litochoro intending to\nclimb the mountain but decided against it\nat the last minute. However, it's an\nexperience in itself to lie on a beach with\nthe home of the gods towering nearly\n3000 metres above you with its feet in\nthe sea!\nAfter visiting the ancient historical\nsights in Delphi and Athens, we headed\nfor the island of Santorini in the Cyclades.\nThe night ferry crossing from Athens\ncosts only about \u00a38 if you sleep on deck.\nSantorini was formed about 4,000 years\nago by a massive volcanic explosion in\nthe Aegean sea. The volcano still\nsmoulders on a nearby island. We went\nout to see it on a boat trip. Our party\nclimbed the mound of black rock and ash\nto the sulphur-caked sum it, then, after\nreturning to the boat, we dived into the\nsea to swim in the hot springs where\nwater heated inside the volcano wells up\nto mix with the sea.\nOn Santorini, we spent one night on the\nroof of Kontohori youth hostel in the\ntown of Thira, and three nights sleeping\non the black sand beach at Perissa. It's not clear whether you are actually\nallowed to sleep on the beaches but\nplenty of people do it.\nTo cross free to Italy you have to sleep\non deck but this is no hardship in the\nAdriatic during the summer. From the\nharbour town of Brindisi we travelled\nacross Italy to Naples where we stayed in\nthe excellent modern youth hostel. From Naples it's a short train and bus ride to\nmount Vesuvius and Pompeii. We\nunfortunately didn't have time in our\nschedule to visit Pompeii, but managed to\nclimb to the huge crater at the top of\nVesuvius. The walk is fairly easy as a bus\ntakes you most of the way. Naples itself is\na busy port which is rather overcrowded\nand chaotic, but the national museum\n(which houses many of the relics found at\nPompeii as well as a fascinating collection\nof ancient Egyptian artifacts) is well\nworth a visit, and the pizzas are fantastic.\nOur next stop was Rome where we\nspent two days admiring the sights of\nancient Rome, especially the Coloseum\nand the Palatine Hill, and those in the\nVatican City\u2014St Peter's basilica, the\nVatican museum and the Sistine Chapel.\nRome has an excellent purpose-built\nyouth hostel, the largest we stayed in on\nour travels.\nFrom Rome we travelled on to Tuscany\nand the Renaissance splendour of\nFlorence and Pisa. Florence is very\nrelaxing, and it is interesting to walk\nbetween the painted houses near the\nDuomo cathedral and the Puento Vecchio\nbridge. There's a restaurant in Florence\nwhich is reputed to make the best icecream in all Italy (and therefore the\nA church on Santorini\nworld). We also found a site in the\ncountryside just outside the city where\nyou can sleep for free on roofed wooden\nplatforms.\nAfter a brief stop in Bologna to try the\nspaghetti bolognaise in its town of origin,\nwe went on to Venice. Venice is a good\nplace to wander in, with many winding\nalleys, hump-back bridges and small\nsquares as well as the famous sights of St\nMark's square and basilica and the Doges'\nPalace (home of the old Venetian\ngovernment). The town consists of 117\nislets and to reach Venice's youth hostel,\nanother of the excellent modern Italian\ntype, you need to take a water bus.\nPasses available for 24-hour travel on\nwater buses are a good way of seeing\nVenice.\nA route through Greece and Italy such\nas this one, could be made in either\ndirection and there is also great scope for\nideas in your route between home and\nsouthern Europe. On the way there, we\npassed through the German city of\nCologne with its excellent cathedral, saw\nthe magnificent imperial buildings in\nVienna, from where half of Europe was\nruled for more than six centuries, and\ntook a glimpse at life in Eastern Europe\nin our visit to Budapest. Here we were\namazed at the sights and activity\nalongside the Danube at night. The\njourney down to Greece\u2014the infamous\nBelorade-Athens run\u2014was not pleasant\nbut nothing like as bad as any of the\nhorror stories we had heard. The journey\nfrom Budapest took 24 hours, but we had\nseats for most of the time and when we\nhad to stand at least the scenery was\ninteresting!\nOn the return journey, we passed\nthrough the Swiss Alps, stopping in\nZermatt at the foot of the Matterhorn,\nbefore returning home through France\nand Ireland (there are free ferries to and\nfrom Ireland).\nTo use the free ferry crossing as well as\ntrain services, you need an 'Inter-Rail and\nBoat' card which costs \u00a3180. An ordinary\nInter-Rail card costs \u00a3155. I ended up\nspending nearly \u00a3500 on the whole\nmonth's holiday but have no doubt that it\ncould have been done for less.\nOur travels through Greece and Italy\nwere very enjoyable and our activities\nvaried enormously in the time we were\nthere. One day we were exploring the\ntiny cliff-top villages on Santorini on hired\nmopeds and only days later admiring the\nmagnificent Renaissance architecture of\nTuscany.\nIf you want a holiday which combines\nso many natural and historical sights with\ndays lying on a beach and loads of pizza\nand ice-cream, an inter-rail trip through\nGreece and Italy is excellent value for\nmoney.\n19\n\n"

    "content": "pi Kill the Rooster to\nFrighten the Monkey\nFELIX\nTwo hunched, sullen figures were pushed\nroughly through a curtain hanging across\nthe corridor. They were holding hands no, their thumbs were clamped together\nbetween the knuckles. They were beaten\nrepeatedly until they lay on the floor\nbelow my bunk. One thumb-clamp was\nloosened and their arms were fed through\nthe bunk legs to unite with the clamp the\nother side. It looked very painful and\nboth prisoners winced when their arms\nwere twisted and their thumbs were bent.\nThe digits were badly swollen and the\nskin was bloated around their dirty nails.\nThey lay there with staring, guilty\nexpressions.\nI established that they had been caught\nstealing money. Justice in China seems to\nbe dispensed entirely by the police, who also decide the penalty. The ultimate\npenalty is execution.\nThe policeman who kicked them when he passed, grinned and seemed pleased\nwith his arrest. They would not be here\ntomorrow, he said. 1 asked what their fate\nwas. He replied by miming a gunshot in\nthe head, the standard mannerism for\nexecution. Both figures twisted and\ncontorted their bodies to escape from the\nkicks beneath my bunk. They lay in the\ncigarette stubs, melon skins and chewed\nchicken bones, the whites of their eyes\nlarge and bright in the dusk.\nFrequently executions are carried out at\nmass gatherings. The purpose of this is to\nmaximise the deterrence potential, the\nofficial reason being that 'it is good to\nhave some people executed so as to\neducate others'.\nIt was a hot, uncomfortable night. I slept in starts, waking to brush\ncockroaches from my face. When dawn\ncame, the convicts were gone, their lives\nterminated to 'educate others'.\nMass execution.\nIf you can't make it to the stadium then\nyou can always catch up with the\nmonth's killings at the exhibition. In\nalmost all the large cities there are\npermanent deterrent boards dedicated to\ngruesome, stomach-churning pictures of\nthe latest executions. The pictures here\nwere part of an exhibition in Kunming ,\nYunnan province, in southern China.\nOther subjects covered included\nparticularly gory, fatal road accidents,\nand decaying genitals\u2014the victims of VD. It is hard to say how China's crime rate\ncompares with those in other countries.\nJuvenile crime is a growing problem in\nthe cities. The types of crime committed\ninclude murder, rape, and theft of large\nsums of money. Criminal groups of\nyoungsters are common. The official\nblame is placed on influence from foreign\ncriminal cliques portrayed in the mass\nmedia. Perhaps it is simply that they are\nA candidate for death.\nfollowing the example of their 'glorious\nleaders'.\nBut the death penalty is part of Chinese\nculture, an accepted way of life. The\ngeneral opinion in China is of support for\nthe death penalty and most agree that it\nis necessary today to maintain the low\ncrime rate. Chinese argue that life\nimprisonment, favoured by Europe is an\nexpensive alternative which cannot be\nadopted by China at present. The\nirrevocable deaths of the wrongly\nconvicted are simply a 'pity'.\nAlthough execution is usually reserved\nfor murder and rape, during the\nnumerous clamp-downs that take place\n'execution quotas' have to be met by\neach province. If the quota isn't reached,\nthe pettiness of crimes which warrant\ndeath increase.\nIn 1984 a village party secretary in\nShaanxi Province put 72 villagers into\ncustody for suspicion of stealing part of\nhis bicycle bell. Seventeen were tortured\nand the another 28 were held for eight\ndays and forced to pay fines to cover the\ncost of the guards.\nBack in Yunnan Province a group of\npolicemen detained 201 people in 1986\nfor 'law-study class' which lasted as long\nas eighty days. Many were fined and\ntortured until they confessed to crimes\nthey had not committed. As a result two\npeople committed suicide, one person\ndied and many were wounded.\nBefore June 1989 China's last round-up\nof criminals started in 1983 when 100,000\nwere arrested. In the last eighteen\nmonths the same number have lost their\nlives in the name of 'education', for\ncrimes no greater than writing this\narticle.\nChristopher Riley.\nThis is an extract from part of an\nAmnesty Group exhibition on Human Rights, to be held in the J CR next week,\nbetween the 5th and 7th March.\n\n"

The hall authorities contacted\nthe police who instructed Mr Wong to go\nhead with buying the bike, as this would\nincriminate the suspected thief.

    "content": "Escape from China along the Karakoram Highway\nA Passage to Pakistan\nIt was a better bus than I'd hoped for.\nMen with rugged macho faces, wild but\nshapely beards and well established\nmoustaches mooched amidst acres of\nluggage. Their heads were crowned with\nweather-beaten turbans and they were\ndressed in baggy cotton suits and long\nwoollen waistcoats. Vacuum tea sets, pots\nand pans, sacks of tinsel and other\nChristmas decorations burst from cloth\nbags. It took almost three hours to\nbalance it all on the roof and fight out\nthe seating plan. There were three\nJapanese, two Swiss, one Nepalese, two\nBritish and twelve Pakistani passengers.\nEveryone wanted a window seat. During the two day journey we were to cross the\nhighest pass in the world. At 16,540 ft the\nKhunjerab pass traverses the highest\nconcentration of lofty peaks anywhere in\nthe world. The Karakoram, the Parmirs,\nthe Himalayas and the Hindu Kush all\nmeet in a uniquely chaotic jumbled\nsplendour.\nOne hour into the ride, and as we\napproached the outskirts of the oasis, the\ndriver stopped, abandoned the bus and\ntook up residence on a solitary wooden\nframed bed at the road side. As he dozed\nwe all ate cold noodles nearby.\nThree hours out of Kashgar we hit the\nGhez valley. An undersized stream\ntrickled through an oversized wide basin\nof glacial moraines and convoluted\nsandstone layers. Under precipitous\noverhangs we sped, on round lumpy\ncorners suffering from rock fall debris.\n'Wooden' knots and grains spiralled\nthrough the rock. The cliffs rose up at\nsuch an angle that even by craning my neck as far as possible the sky was not in\nsight. The first check-point and grumpy\nofficial came an hour or so later and from\nhere the road grew gradually worse; in\nfact it seemed a miracle that any road\ncould exist at all.\nSnow-covered, shattered peaks replaced\nblue skies and distances could no longer\nbe judged. Everything seemed so close,\nwhether one or fifty kilometres away.\nThe road climbed steeply and the engine\nadopted that whining monotone drone of\nmechanical strain. Periodically the track\ndisappeared and the bus swayed off into\nthe desert careering over rocks and\nboulders and through streams to rejoin\nthe 'road' a little further on.\nIt descended the roller-coaster stretches\nof corrugated kidney- bashing channels at\nbreakneck speed, seemingly out of\ncontrol. The Pakistani passengers sat\nhuddled on their seats like Antarctic\npenguins, feet and limbs tucked into\nlayers of blubber o us clothes and scarfs,\nblinking eyes squeezed between turbans\nand veils.\nWe passed road side workers camps\nand tiny collections of flat roofed single-storey square mud dwellings, sporting\nwaving kids cocooned in multiple layers.\nAt 196 kilometres from Kashgar and at\nan altitude of 3,900 metres we passed\nKarakuli Lake, with horses, yaks and\ncamels in scattered dots, grazing the\nfertile plains. The horizon was dominated\nby the massive Muztagata Mountain, its\n5,000 m vastness overwhelming and its\nglaciers slowly spilling forth.\nWe stopped for a brief toilet stop at the\ncold, numbing height of 12,000 feet. As who acted as if this was the first bus they\nhad seen, it probably was! In ruffled,\nbaggy uniforms, brains numbed with cold\nand boredom, they gave a cursory glance\nat the paper work and ushered us on.\nAt ten p\"m Beijing time, we reached the\nlittle frontier outpost of Tashkurgan 260\nkm and ten hours drive from Kashgar.\nWe stopped here for the night. The\nrooms were clean and cold for 10 yuan\nthe sun sank, prematurely extinguished\nby the rugged scenery, the Pakistanis\nthrew off their robes and squatted in\nrubble-filled drainage ditches. A staring,\ncontorted camel train of Kirghiz nomads\npassed us by.\nAt dusk we reached the Tashkurgan\ncheckpoint with its two bemused guards\n(\u00a31). The Japanese c loc lP in reception\nchimed ten and played a little tune,\nwhich the Japanese sang along and\ngiggled to. The hotel was run by bad-tempered Han Chinese who hated\neverything and everyone, including\nthemselves. There was no hot water for\ntea in the dining room, and beer (our last\nfor a while) was twice the normal price.\nThe rice, vegetable and egg dishes that\nwe ordered took forever. It didn't help\ntheir mood that we were keen to get rid\nof our change and paid in one, two and\nfive fen notes, (O. lp). I filled my metal\ndrinking bottle with hot water from a boiler and put it in my bed for an hour\nor so, praying for it not to leak. The\nduvet was thick and my sleep was deep.\nIt was hard to get out of bed at 8.30am. The restaurant was closed so we stocked\nup on little hard flower-shaped frozen\nbiscuits from a man with a box ful on the\nroad outside. The bus pulled out at\n9.00am and we sat shivering. I peeled an\napple out of the window and lost the\nsensation in my hands. We sat and bit on\nthe hard biscuits and I stamped my numbed feet on the floor.\nAfter half an hour we broke down. The\ndriver opened the doors and fiddled with\nthe engine. We sat and shivered. He\ndidn't bother to fix it - we drove on all\nthe same. The mountains were more\nspread out as we crossed the wide\ngrasslands, spliced by a vivid blue river.\nWe chewed biscuits and hurt our teeth on\nthose that were still frozen.\nAt mid-day we reached the Chinese\nborder post of Pirali, a ten building,\nnowhere place, about 200m long, with a bank, a customs check point and a passport-stamping room. A kar ky tent\nboasted 'Foreign Friends Rest Place'. How Chinese, how meaningless, how final. I was weary of this country and of my three month continuous struggle with baffling and pointless bureaucracy.\nTheend was now in sight.\nThe effort to unload the bus was hardly\nworth the hassle. Customs was a joke,\nand we went in search of food. In the\npassport-stamping room they sold bottles\nof Coca-cola, duck- shaped biscuits, tinned\nfruit and tea sets for 'Foreign Friends'.\nWe squatted in the middle of the road\nand wolfed down some tinned cherries\nbefore they froze! Two hours after\narriving, we were waving the Chinese\nsoldiers and China bye bye.\nNo-mans-land was bleak and Scottish.\nThe road climbed higher from the river\nbed and across a bog-land. Lakes and\nbrooks lay frozen and white in the\ntundra. Yaks and buffalo grazed and\nstared and people looked up from their\ntoil with shell-shocked expressions. By\nmid-afternoon we had reached point zero\nat 16,000 feet. Pakistani and Chinese\nsoldiers stood and chatted at the\nmonument and the bus whizzed past.\nA steep, nerve-fraying descent followed,\nfraught with double hair-pin bends. Tall\nnarrow gorges like huge doors ajar\nrevealed tantalizing glimpses of other\nkingdoms, shining bright snowfield s and\njagged, carnivorous, toothed peaks. It was\nlike being lowered into a deep well,\nstraining ever more to see sky. Huge\nhang-glider-sized eagles swooped and\nspiralled below, and big black rooks\nflapped by in formation. Yurts (a sort of\ntent) lay sprinkled around the river\nvalleys and streaky cold waters gushed\nby.\nLate in the afternoon we reached Dih,\nthe Pakistan check-point, a little 'garden'\nnurtured painstakingly to life, a little oasis\ngerminated in the rubble. The barrier was\nraised by the invisible gardener. Someone\ngot on and the door refused to close. A passenger kicked it and wedged it fast.\nThe Chinese driver tried in vain to repair\nit. The screwdriver had no effect on the\ndoor and was instead turned on the\npassenger.\n'Foreign Friends Welcome\nResting Here'\nWe pressed on under over-hanging\ngorges which turned the road into a tunnel. The driver dodged fresh landslide\nmaterial and the bus pitched and yawed\nlike an overloaded camel. The snowy\ngrey peaks rose up as far as you could\nimagine and then twice as high again.\nThe Kunjerab River flowed into the\nHunza River, shining white and dazzling.\nIn the afternoon sun the canyon walls\nswirled im misc i bly in different browns\nlike an oil-painter's pallet, below the\nawesome, steely-grey, dog-tooth\ntombstone peaks. The sky was a vivid\nunnatural blue. Around each corner, as I marvelled at the overpowering enormity\nof each spiky peak another even greater,\nmore rugged, soaring spot lit summit came\ninto view.\nBelow if was Sust, the Pakistan border\nand immigration post. The town itself is\njust a jumbled collection of single storey\nshacks, with names beyond their status;\n'The Khunjerab Hotel', 'The Sust\nInternational Hotel'. Customs and\nimmigration are some equally shabby\nwooden huts in a courtyard on the left,\nfenced off by a dry stone wall and a barbed wire topping.\nI had only eaten frozen biscuits and\ntinned cherries all day. The restaurant\nsigns protruding over the wall were too\nmuch. After queuing to wait for passport\nformalities I could wait no longer. Out of\nthe compound Sust had the atmosphere\nof a large airy Alpine camping site. I enquired where the toilets were.\n'This is an open area...you crap in the\ndesert'\nThe 'desert' was a stony glacial moraine\naffair with a gurgling meltwater stream\ngushing southwards. A real toilet with a view. The bags were being unloaded\nwhen I returned. Just out of the 'town\ncentre' was the Mountain Rescue Inn. It\nwas a small collection of holiday camp\nterraced chalets. It was clean and\npleasant and the people were friendly,\nquite a novelty - a curious blend of\nBritish colonialism, Islamic hospitality,\nand Muslim fundamentalism; of cricket\npitches on pristine lawns and jostling\nhorizons of village church spires and mosques, crescent moons and wind vanes.\nWith a pot of sweet milky tea I settled\ndown to read the visitors book. There\nwere Belgian writers, Polish geologists, a convention of milk-men from all over the\nworld, British thieves, vagabonds,\nastronauts, space travellers, Australian\nmii k maids, Afghan warlords, grave-diggers and martians. I never read such\nfrivolities in Chinese visitors books.\nIt was only after leaving China that I realised what was missing, how backward\nand abnormally stifled it was; how\nartificial and synthetic the public\nfriendship was, and how oppressed and\nfrantic the people were beneath their\nlampshade hats. We had slipped through\nthe Karakoram curtain and escaped from\nthe China's suffocating suppression. I was\nglad to be free.\n\n"

    "content": "The Slow Moving Snail presents more thoughts...\nTonics for the Tube\nTwenty-one floors up creates a wonderful\nview of sunrise over London. Yet there is\na sense of being boxed. Caged above\nLondon one and a quarter hours from\ncollege gives me a sense of nausea as I start each new day. To spark-up my mind from this d old rumI resort to the book.\nThe first book leans against the wall of\nthe toilet. As my yesterday's meal\nplummets twenty-one floors - does it\nbehave as Galileo suggests? Well, I suppose it is a far cry from balls off Pisa1 read a light tonic. A dog that flies a Sopwith, is terrified of the local cat, goes\ninto 'rejection' state as his first novel\ncannot find a publisher. There is only one\ncartoonist who can create such a psychotic character, Charles Schultz. I reread these cartoons every day,\nem pathi sing with Charlie Brown. No one\nelse could persuade themselves that they\nare needed by arguing with a tree that\neats kites, or be so bored with life and so\nunable to talk to the girl he fancies.\nCharlie expresses my feelings in a world\nof pool-playing beagles and ice-hockey-playing little yellow birds, a fantastic\nworld in which the sad and frustrated\nbecome a cause to smile. I have a book\nthat psycho analyses the characters in\nAlice in Wonderland, has anyone done it\nto Charlie Brown?\nJames Thurber was in many ways a again leaving only a girl, a boy and the\nlast flower. The flower becomes a symbol\nof love that is needed to create hope.\nThurber - Volumes 1 and 2 are great\nbooks for the morning throne. Sadly they\nare too heavy for the tube.\nFor the long tunnel of the underground\nI recommend a John Steinbeck book, or\nsome poetry.\nSteinbeck has recently been\nrepublished, a good thing as some of his\nnovels were becoming scarce. Cannery\nRow is a place in which 'whores, pimps,\ntragic figure, blind in one eye due to a childhood accident, and slowly going\nblind in the other, always worried about\nbeing run-over while wearing dirty\nunderpants. His cartoons, short stories\nand fables are coloured with sharp irony\nand an everyday sense of the absurd. His\nRed Riding Hood blows the head off the\nwolf. A seal lies on the headboard of the\nbed as the husband dismisses his wife's claim to have heard a bark.\nAs a writer for the New Yorker he\ndoodled cartoons at unbelievable speed,\nthese jokes eventually got printed and\nmade his reputation. His favourite cartoon\nwas a story he drew while depressed\nduring the second world war. It is called\nThe Last Flower, the world being\ndestroyed by politicians and religious\nfanatics, being rebuilt and destroyed\ngamblers, and sons of bitches,' become\n'Saints and angels and martyrs and holy\nmen', at least through the meticulously\ndetailed images that celebrate life and\nexpress a love of his characters.\nSteinbeck's world is powerful enough to\nlose your sense of reality whilst hanging\nonto those back handles as you wind through the tunnels. A must for those of\nus that otherwise close our eyes to\nescape from the inhuman world of\nLondon Underground.\nGavin Ewart can now be read on the\ntube. He is one of several poets\ncelebrated by the national Poetry Society\nusing posters of their work. This month Gavin is launching a new collection, of\nhis poems over the past decade. He will\nbe reading and talking about his work at\nthe Poetry Society, 21 Earls Court Square\n(just by Earls Court tube) on 14th March at 7:30pm. Gavin has been writing poetry\nfor many years giving his work great\nbreadth and interesting historical\ndevelopments. His war poems contrast,\nand thereby confuse, the fantasy of the\ncardboard cut-out target with the\nbreathing human. His short funny poems\nare medicinal tablets against feeling too\nserious. Take these books and don't let\nthe world get you down.\nAMNESTY!\non display in\nthe JCR\n5- 7 March\nYour chance to find out about\nAmnesty International, its work\nand what you can do to de op. Plus letter writing stall and sale\nof Amnesty goods on Tuesday\nand Thursday lunchtimes.\nOrganised by Imperial College\nGroup.\n\n"
