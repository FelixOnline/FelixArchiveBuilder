While it is interesting to know what the\nviews of minority political\ngroups are, it is boring to\nread them week after\nweek. Surely the job of\nthe editor of Felix is to\nproduce a newspaper that\nis of Interest to the college\nas a whole and not air\nhis own revolutionary\nideas. There is no 'What'sOn' column and little\nnews of matters of\ngeneral interest other\nthan grants and refectory\nprices. Of course we are,\nc blighted to be so well informed of grievances, sit-ins etc. at other colleges\nand universities, but what\nabout IC? Can we not\nhave a paper that informs\npeople what is going on\nhere, apart from political\nevents? In a college this\nsize there can hardly be a lack of news, so why don't we hear it?\nCAROLYN CHANDLER( Physics)\nAmnesty\nInternational\nDear Ali, Most readers of Felix\nare probably unaware of\nthe fact that we now have\nour own Amnesty International Group here in\ncollege. Amnesty International is an independent\norganisation which campaigns strongly for the release of people imprisoned anywhere in the\nworld for their non-viol-ent expression of political\nor religious beliefs, or for\ntheir racial or ethnic\norigin. There are over a thousand such groups\nthroughout the world; and\nin the 12 years of its existence Amnesty International has secured the\nrelease of over 500\nprisoners.\nOur own group (like\nevery group) has adopted\nthree prisoners of con-science, and we are working for their release, by ap-peals, etc. We need more\nmembers to help us in the\ncampaign. Anyone interested should come along\nto the weekly meetings at\n7 p.m. on Wednesdays in\nthe Upper Lounge of the\nUnion, or should contact\none of us:\nMILES BURGESS( hon. sec.)\nLinstead 212, or Physics\nAVER IL DE WING( hon. tre as.) Selkirk 562, or Physics\nContradiction\nSir,\nYou appear to be getting very few letters for\nFelix, and since Iam not\nan idealist as you suggested in your reply to my\nlast letter, let i the correspondence continue.\nThere is a definite contradiction in what you\nsay in your editorial and\nin your reply to my last\nletter. In the latter you\nsay you wish Ito \"break\nthe working class from\nreformism by calling for\nthe election of a\" Labour government pledged to\nsocialist policies\". That is,\nyou are backing reformism in order to expose it,\nfor whether Labour policies are socialist or not,\nLabour certainly stands\nfor reforms not re vol u tion. On the other hand\nin your editorial you say\nthat a reformist grants\ncampaign (i.e. for a grants increase not for the\noverthrow of the Tory government) should not\nbe undertaken and here\nyou reject learning through practice that-\"re-form is m leads to defeat\"\nsaying that we have already learned-this.\nSurely in i the case of the\ngrants campaign this is\nnot the case. The \u00a320 in crease was taken as an\nindication that we can\nachieve some gains,\nthough temporary, by\nsuch campaigns and therefore was not a defeat We did not force the Tories\nto resign but this was\nnever our aim. I agree\nthat one achieves nothing\nin the long term by reformism but that is not\nwhat you are saying.\nAs for the case of the\nLabour Party, I explained\ntwo weeks ago why it was\nbl an tant ly obvious already from the experience of the last six Labour\ngovernments that Labour is not socialist. You di id not answer these points.\nSo why do you, lin contradiction with your position\non the grants campaign,\ncon lt in ue to deceive the\nworking class and encourage reformism by backing Ithe Labour Party?\nThe capitalist class uses\nthe Labour to deceive the\nworkers, why do you,\nwho claim to be revolutionaries, do the same? If\nyou want socialism, why\ndon't you say so openly\nand campaign for support\non that basis and try to\nbring real revolutionary\npolitics to the working\nClass? Or would your\nmembership fall?\nAs for democratic centralism in the S.L.L., former members of the\nS.L.L. Central Committee\nhave said that major political decisions had already\nbeen made above even\nthat level (by Gerry\nHealy?), i.e. there was no\ndemocratic centralism on\nthe Central Committee let\nalone in the rest of the\norganisation.\nYour sincerely,\nKATHLEEN CORCORAN Sir,\nMay I express my\nthanks to all the stud-ents, both for the opportunity to speak at your\nmeeting and the courtesy that was shown tow ard s me by all those\npresent.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX November ft fe,11973 The Art and Science of play in; the Violin\nI went into Mech. Eng.220 at 20.10 when the\nlecture was about to start. The theatre was EXTRAORDINARILY crowded with people. 1 saw some\nlecturers in the audience. Unfortunately, 1 was too\nlate to have a seat so I had Ito sit on the steps. I estimated that at least 300 were there. Having been intro-duce d, Yehudi started his lecture smartly. However\nYehudi spoke well both in his style and the content\nof the lecture itself.\nHe paralleled human activities to the playing of\nthe violin. In fact, every human activity has its\necho in itself. Application of the bow on the violin,\nmaking sounds, making music can be modified to\nbe a model of one's normal life, every part in mind.\nSome examples were mentioned before he moved\nto the next step, when he talked about teaching to\nplay the Violin in contrast with school teaching. He disagreed with the use of a text-book in teaching ito\nplay the violin, as well as other musical instruments:\nfor the process inhibited the learner from having his\nown kind of thinking. He pitied a school teacher who\nhad to follow the same book year after year as if\nhe were a man who did not speak in his own voice.\nWhen Yehudi teaches music he tries to avoid using\nbooks, as he said. Then he Introduced the moment\nwhen a person made something wrong with himself\nand, by no means, can blame any other people: the\nsituation when we play a wrong tune on the in trui ment! Is this one part of life?\nYehudi mentioned the \"addiction\" in playing instrument or in a choir as beautiful addictions. Like\nany other \"addictions\", this has to be learned? He questioned whether the musical work was a penalty\nan artist has to suffer. According to him, he was sure\nthat we had great violinists because they were pleased\nto make music and they also tried to do it as best\nas they can, consistently, they tried to do a good job.\nApart, from addiction, he suggested the movement in\nhuman beings' civilisation, i.e. the evolution of civilisation in various parts of the world. He praised\nalthough a vulgar may think of time as the clock tolling When he can go out from the office, musically,\ntime lis a. raw material for a composer to organise in between the second marks on the clock, to make it\npass slowly or quickly or accelerate or even stand\nstill. He told us that at school in the night before the\nholiday began he used to count to sleep to a million\nand remembered the feeling of the slowness of time!\nHe found, the violin was a living beautiful object.\nIt is a living thing because of its vibration, it is\none part of the universe, as an element of the movement of the complete vibration of the whole uni-verse, for it is a precise part in musical com mu nica tion, via the opened ears, opened minds and bodies.\nHis definition of music was also the organisation of\nraw material of sounds. He tried to convince the\naudience that we might 'feel that holding a violin\nwas.like holding a bird, its body was free of imp uri ties. The sound is created by the space in the hollow\npart of the Violin and also if one put the violin correctly at the collar bone it sounds more since the\nspace in one's body resonates too. The stretched\nstring that vibrates represents the stretching mind,\nthe tension, sense of direction and sense of time.\nWhen one starts playing the violin there are roughly\nthree stages to be experienced: i the passive stage with\nthe feeling of looseness, the gravity stage when one\ntries to balance himself actively with the weights, and\nthe strong stage when one is able to create some sense\nof acceleration.\nYehudi concluded his lecture with some phases\nwritten in his notes that sound reasonable to his\narguments. He left with the impression that music\nhad been played because it was believed to lead\nsomeone to' self liberation. We have examples of\nNegroes' music in the United States, Jews' music\nin South Soviet Russia, the Gypsy music, in which\nvio'ins are played in a way that they sound like\nhuman voices. Then we were let to ask him some\nquestions.\ni Well soc lecture by Yehudi Menuhin\nEastern and Gypsies' music and compared them with\nthe Western style. For most western musicians are\nwell disciplined to read others' compositions, unless\na performer has some sense, some experience, some\nfeeling and some understanding of the composer,\nhe cannot, play the music in the same way that was\ncx peC iC1 by the composer. Furthermore, he should\nknow .,;e world o \u00a3 Jie composer: how he lived \u2014\nbrutal, romantic, etc. \u2014 what his life was like, and\nwhat was the feeling in such a composition. Meanwhile he found the Gypsy music was somewhat different from what we have here. From his own experience, he found every note played, sung, cried and\nspoke as the musicians played the music directly\nfrom their heads without any score written beforehand or by another person.\nNow came the technical bit of the talk, which 1\nmight no: understand it correctly. He opened the\ntopic by saying that as we, the audience in l.C, were\nscientists, we might be interested in the violin tech-ni ques. There were three techniques he discussed.\nFirstly, the Vi.brato, he argued about what someone\nsaid about vibrato, that \"violinists are born with and\nneed not be taught\" that is not really correct since\nthe natural vibrato produced by a player was due to\nthe .perfect balance of handling the violin and the\nbow. He re\\ea led that in playing the violin the hands\nwere in relaxation positions and movements: the vio-ten is tt never got tired because of playing it. Such a balance made vibrato extraordinarily wonderful and\nfree. Secondly, the precision in playing, as one plays\nalong one gains more subtle sense that brings more\nprecision in controlling the violin. He referred to the\nsu'b'. if.y in m cro-e kcr onic designs or precise physical measurements, to the ability of a human finger\nto feel what a millionth of an ounce is. One may also\nobtain the ability to understand others as well as oneself from the self-discipline in the practice where one's subtlety in sensation grows. Thirdly, the time.\nSomeone asked him to explain how some Indian\nmusic wa splayed. He introduced us to the name \" Gravis hAnk a,\" an Indian music master and told us how\nthe music was arranged. There are 70-80 scales in Indian music. Each scale has its own rule and well suits\nto one frame of mind. There are 7 to 9 but not more\nthan 9 notes in an octave (compared to 42 in our s ys tem). Rhythms are more complex than our music. For example they play 6/7 and 7/8 (!) precisely. One can clearly see how difficult it is to distinguish the counter-rhythm to the beat since i they are nearly equal in\nthe same period of time. However, the accuracy of\ntiming and precision in playing destroys the harmony\n\u2014 this is why they sound different from our music.\nThe remarkable ability in Indian singers and musicians is that they can detect very slight deviation of\nsound from a perfect fifth and the pitch in Indian\nsongs are so precise however quickly they are sung.\nThere were so many hands raised up that he mistook a student as a girl. \"I thought,\" he said, \"you're\nthe young lady.\" There were some interesting quest-ions. But the most interesting one was the last bit\nthat made he explained about the SUZUKI method\nof practising young musicians in Japan. They believed\nthat if they taught small children one \" good\" kind\nof music, this can be learned as \"mother's tongue\" like\nlanguage learning. Children play music with real pleasure like games though all of them start with the same\nsong. Yehudi believes this is the correct way to introduce music, or arts, science and architecture, into\nKindergartens. He was sure that even the modern 'el-ec tronic music', if someone built it in a kit form that\nchildren can play with, is still good for the child-ren. I was really i rr pressed with the success of SUZUKI method. Could the learning for pleasure of children be a part of future society? I remembered the1 lengthy clap of hands: it was about one minute; and\nalso his favourite word \"Extraordinary\"!\nH. T.KO A NANTA KOOL NUS POSTGRAD\nCONFERENCE\nThe conference was held at Birkbeck College\non Saturday, October 20th, and was attended by 70\ndelegates representing 37 Universities, Polys and Colleges of Education. Discussion reflected the-deter i or a ting economic position of Pg students and centred\nround Demonstrating Rates and the Grants Campaign.\nIn the past N.U.S. has paid scant attention to the\nproblems of postgraduates, but recently because of\npressure from Pg activists in various colleges, including I.C., and the energy of Doug Harrison, the\nmember of N.U.S. exec, who has recently assumed\nresponsibility for Pg affairs the situation has begun\nto change. An as yet incomplete survey of demonstrating rates over the country has shown wide\nvariation in hourly payments, hours worked, and\nthe number of students involved. Many colleges\nhave successfully campaigned for increases recently\nand the message seemed to be that once Postgrads are\norganised in an institution, increases can be obtained.\nAt Sussex, for instance, a short strike produced\nan increase from \u00a31 to \u00a31.60 and the tying of the\npayment to the lecturers' pay scale, ensuring an annual percentage increase.\nThe conference passed a motion on grants and\ndemonstrating containing the following main points:\n1. Grants should be mandatory for students obtaining places for postgraduate study;\n2. The rate of grant should be increased and fixed\nby the notional elements making up the U.G. grant in the following way:\u2014\u2022\n52/30 of the allowance for board and lodging.\n47/30 of the travel and course cost element.\n5/22 of the vacation subsistence allowance.\nIn addition, students in London should receive an\nextra allowance, again in line with the U.G. grant.\n3. Demonstrating rates should be tied to the minim um hour iy rate of- the lecturer's pay scale.\nThis motion has to be passed by the N.U.S. annual\nconference at Margate in December before becoming\nofficial policy. Joe Herbertson and Pete Connell, the\nI.C. delegates, put forward the policy of LC. P.G. Group that Postgrads should receive a Jiving wage.\nSuch a policy applied to all students would automatically end many of the anomalies which the Grants\ncampaign lis pledged to remove. However, the student\nwage is no longer N.U.S. policy and many delegates\nfelt that if adopted for Pgs alone it would split the\nGrants Campaign and encourage an elitist view of\nthe Pg position.\nIf you've wondered how your grant is made up\nand who fixed the figure, don't bother to ask the\nS. R.C. or D.E. S.Ata recent meeting neither body\nwas able or willing to explain it to an N.U.S. representative and both denied responsibility. It was\nsuggested that \u00a365 was a merit allowance, paid for\nour achievement in surviving the academic hurdle\nrace and winning l sts' s and 2.1's. Subtract \u00a365\nfrom the total and it looks even more absurd! Negotiations are now in course between the D.E.S. and\nN.U.S. which are supposed to fix the grant for\nthe period 1974-8. It is essential that our views are\nexpressed as strongly as possible in the next few\nweeks. Come to the l.C. P.G. meeting at 12.30 p.m. today and discuss the most effective way to express\nour claims for grants, London weighting and anything else you-'want to raise. There's no excuse now\nfor explaining inactivity by saying Pgs are in a special\nposition and different from U.G. s \u2014 the P.G. grant\nis being negotiated on the same basis as the Undergraduate grant.

The reward\ncomes from sharing the\nsense of bewilderment,\nand perhaps taking cover\nbehind someone else's troubles. Some might\neven be motivated enough to do something.\nThe last Touchstone was concerned with' Radical Alternatives to Prison'. In dealing with prisons\nthe attitude of society\ntowards crime and the\nnature of crime have to\nbe questioned. There is\nno fundamental law of\nhuman nature which can\ndefine core ct social be-ha vi our. Rules against\nmurder and the breaking\nof promises seem self-evident to us because our\nsociety depends on\nthem. Other rules like\nthe laws against homo-sexuality, prostitution\nand drug taking only\ndefine the nature of\nsociety and can be flex-i ble. If we accept the\nnon - universit ali ty of\nsocial laws, we can go a long way towards accepting criminals, realising the non-existence of\na dividing line between\n' us' and ' them' and trying to improve our penal\nsystem.\nIn dealing with the\nsocial origins of crime\nwe inevitably come up\nagainst the dirty word' capitalism'. We blame capitalism for its breaking up of the old secure\nfamily unit by the movement of labour which it\ndemands and by the inadequate town planning (\nwhich goes with it. We blame capitalism for the\nconsumer society which it fosters, the greater\nand greater consumption\nwhich it demands for its\nown livelihood, and the\nstrain it places on individuals to achieve this\nspectacular level of con-sump tion. We blame\ncapitalism for the 'white\ncollar' crimes of today.\nGangsters have turned\nfrom the crude violent\nmethods of yesterday to\nthe sophisticated and\nlegal tax evasion games\nof today.\nThe myth of the quick\nway to riches and the incredible jackpot stories\nmake fools of wage\nearners reminding them\nconstantly of their inadequacy and spurring\nthem onto action.\nWhat is society's solution to the problem of\npeople who yield to its\npressures? It removes\nthem for a time to a highly artificial situation\nand then puts them back\nagain. Perhaps our property and lives are protected for a while and our indignation satisfied,\nbut the heart of the matter is never reached. It\nis in prison that a young\nchild first realises his\nidentity as a juvenile de-lin que nt.. He is stamped for life\nand goes forward with a set of values formed in\nprison.\nThere does not seem\nto be any alternative to\nthis inhuman curtailing\nof personal freedom in\nthe case of violent\nprisoners. All we can do\nis to try to reduce long\nperiods of isolation. During imprisonment we can make sure that\nprisoners are doing work\nwhich is suited to their\nabilities or that they\nlearn something which will keep them out of\nprison. Prisoners have\nbeen found to be very\ngood at social work because they understand\nthe difficulties\nA lot can be done towards successfully resettling released pris-on ers. At the moment\nprisoners are given three\npounds to start their\nnew life with. Even if\nthey do not blow it all\non drink the moment\nthey are released they\ncan still not get a room\nbecause landladies demand at least a week's pay in advance. With no\nfixed abode they cannot\nget social securities and\njobs are very difficult to\nget. It is not surprising\nthat many return to pris-on.\nIn a lot of cases the\ndifficulty of resettling\ncan be evaded by not\nsending offenders to\nprison in the first place.\nMany non-violent prisoners benefit greatly\nfrom community-based\nalternatives and from\nvictim-offender contact.\nAlready prisoners can be\ngiven up to 2 4 0 hours of\ncommunity work instead\nof confinement, but this\nis usually in the form of\nhighly unsuitable manual\nlabour.\nIn Britain the ' Radical Alternatives to Prison'( RAP) group is fighting\nfor research and publicity for radical alternatives. They are a new\ngroup and would very\nmuch welcome any help.\nTheir address is:\n1 0 4 Newgate Street,\nLondon E.C.1. Tel.016004793.( continued on page 6)\n8,000 PACES LATER\nFollowing the mad fiasco of past weeks, the\ncross - country club,\nagainst their better jud g ment, raced around\nRichmond Park for the\nsecond time this year, in\na match against the\npolice last Wednesday. 1\nam sorry to say that we\nnarrowly lost by 82\npoints.\nThe race started at a slow pace, except for one\nKeith Ahlers who at 800\nmetres was leading the\nfield by a clear 50 yards.\nThe police soon turned\nthe tables and made off\nwith a number of the\nbetter positions at the\nfinish 5 miles later.\nA special mention must\ngo to Alf who not only\nknocked 9 mins. 10\nseconds off his personal\nbest but also 118 places\noff last week's performance. This lad was\nclosely followed by Rob who rumbled in noisily in\n9th position.\nIt was rumoured that\nthe dreaded bandaged\nleft knee would be running again but it (the\nbandage) was unwashed,\nso its appearance was\npostponed. Cloaked in a grey trouser leg the knee\nremained unmoved by\nthe occasion. Also noticed, by his absence\nwas G.

The reason\nfor this eviction (which is\nsome months earlier than\nthe Church Commission\noriginally indicated to the\noccupants) is so that the\nChurch Commission can\ngo ahead and convert the\nproperty into expensive\nflats. These flats will be\nbeyond the means of most\npeople in London and will\nonly be built at the expense of the homeless,\nsince the Church Com mission has given no offer\nof new accommodation to\nthe would-be homeless\npeople (which include tea-cher s, students, craftsmen\nand unemployed) it in tends to evict.\nThe building of expensive flats at the expense\nof the homeless must be\nstopped; and where it is\nnot the expensive flats\nshould be taken over by\nthe homeless \u2014 as happened recently in 44 Bartholomew Road, Kentish\nTown. If Councils are\nserious about dealing with\nhomelessness they will\nbuy-up empty properties\nin the hands of spec ul a tors, whether or not they\nhave been converted into\nexpensive flats, and allow\nworking people to use\nthem.\nIn Westminster 1 in 8\nhouses currently stand\nempty and a large proportion of these are Church\nCommission property,\nmeanwhile there are 7,800\npeople on Westminster\nwaiting list, and GOD knows how many more\nnot even on the lists. Yet\nin this situation the\nChurch Commission in tends to increase homelessness and build more\nflats that people in need\ncannot afford.\nSquatters and tenants\nin the Maida Hill Area( Elgin Avenue, Formosa\nStreet, Walterton Road,\nW9 etc.) clearly recognise\nthat the Church Commis-1\nsion is acting directly\nagainst the interests of\nthe fight for decent housing for all; and that their\neviction threats are to be\ndoubly opposed because\nif the Church Commission\nget away with their\nschemes in Formosa\nStreet then the GLC will\nbe encouraged to sharpen\nits attack against the\nhomeless in the whole\narea.\nR mm ill li EVIEWS\nChristian Scientists\nindicted for conspiracy\nHR.

Congress. They\nwrote it to describe 'the\nworking methods of each\nlegislature in as much dc-tal as the practitioners\nand students of each may\nrequire\" (p.3) in an objective manner not intended\nto show that one system\nis better or worse than\nthe other. They simply\nfelt that a comparative\nstudy of the two constitutional systems would be\nuseful.\nThe work itself is an\nauthoritative one using a compare-contrast technique of the major elements\nof the two legislatures\nsuch as leadership, mem-ber ship, finance, and\nscrutiny and control of\nthe Executive, The book\ncovers some 400 pages\nbut is not ponderous;\nrather it is informative, interesting and readable.\nThus, not just those involved in or students of\npolitics would want to\nread it; it also caters to a wider public of those who\nmight be interested in\nfinding out the' strengths\nand weaknesses of each\nsystem against an historical background.\nSome of the more fascinating points of difference between the two systems are listed below.\n(1) Congress has a wider distribution of power,\ni.e. the Senate and House\nhave \"broadly equal\npowers and rights\" (p9).(2) Whereas the prime\nminister is a leader of the\nparty winning a majority\nof' seats in the House\nwhich means the Government can act in the \"s pir it\" of that party, i.e. translating the message into\ngovernmental terms \u2014 in\nCongress the Executive is\nseparated from the legislature and is often at loggerheads with it.\n(3) Britain is a more\ncompact political unit\nand ends to concentrate\non national issues while\nthe U.S. is more diffuse\nwith preoccupation for\nlocal or state issues-(4) The U.S. pays more\nto its legislators keeping\nin mind the differences in\nscale of representation\nand in function, ie. Congressmen represent more\npeople and have more\nduties.\nFinally, the book does\nhave a \"few weaknesses\nsuch as repetition of certain points, a lack of con-clu s ions, suggestions on\nimproving or re hauling either or both systems,\nand in-depth study of the\nfaults of these two forms\nof popular representation.\nBut, the book is long\nenough as it is and not intended as a critical evaluation and improvement\nplan for Parliament and\nCongress.\nPOST-GRADUATES\nMeeting ot 12.30p.m. Union Upper Lounge\nWednesday 7th November\nBroad Left\n1p.m. Union Upper Lounge\nWednesday 7th November\nOnce upon a time, people could afford to go\nfreely on the streets or pavements, cross them or walk\nalong them, relying on their own senses, instincts,\nintelligence, decision making, risk criteria, calculations, etc., thus healthily exercising their faculties and\ngiving \"private attention\" to each individual situ a ton with a maximum efficiency from the humane\npoint of view, both at individual and community\nlevels (beat that!).\nThen the fast motor vehicle appeared in large\nnumbers in the cities bringing privilege to a few and\nthus accelerating the mode of life for all those who\ndidn't want or couldn't afford to lag too far behind,\nhence deteriorating the situation as a whole.\nAs the prevailing institutions were geared to in crease the privilege of the already privileged (as they\nstill normally are), the traffic lights were an \"obvious\"\nresult. Traffic lights facilitated the introduction of the\nmotor car, they contributed to increased production\nof both needs and the things to satisfy them, heading\nthe list of which are the motor car and the traffic\nlights!!, thus increasing our holy G.N.P. On the other\nhand, traffic lights obstruct pavements (instead of\nroads which they're serving), obstruct the view, look\nhorrible, oblige pedestrians to go to the corner of the street and wait just to cross a road, and cost money to the society as a whole either directly by taxing\neveryone or indirectly by having to raise the salaries or\nprofits of those who own a car to allow them to pay\nthe necessary road taxes.\nBut most important, they take from a normal individual (either pedestrian or driver) the capacity to decide whether or not to cross a road (or to drive\nahead in view of a pedestrian) and the responsibility\nfor himself and for others, hence rendering him in capable and irresponsible; they also inculcate the\n\"recognition\" of the \"impossibility\" to cross the road,\nby means of an inaccurate symbol that will be wrong\nmany times. The main consequences of this are: 1\n\u2014 telling the man that the machine is superior to him\nand 2 \u2014 deploring the man of his right to healthily\nuse his senses, his intelligence and responsibility sense,\nthus conditioning him, controlling him and making\nhim \"addict\" to the traffic lights, all this on the\ngrounds that only in this way can the motor car be\nintroduced and still be successful for part of the population at the expense of the whole. It could be alleged\nthat a normal driver could not cope with the traffic\nwere it not for the traffic lights, but what this means\nis that traffic lights are only hiding another symptom\nof the impossibility of solving the transportation\nproblem with high speeds, privilege, and dangerous\nmotor cars. After some time using the new device,\nthe capacity of own decision begins atrophying and\nthe addiction increases, that is, increased control of\npeople at their own expense, ie. enslavement!\nProof of our addiction are the nowadays popular\ntraffic jams caused by the failure of a single set of\nlights; and the accidents on motorways involving large\nnumbers of vehicles, show the inability of drivers to\ncope with \"unofficial\" situations.\nSimilar analysis may be applied to most of the\n\"revolutionary\" devices products of the industrial\n\"revolution\". I prefer to call it the Green-Red \"Revo-lu tion\" and define it as the systematic substitution of\nman's abilities, senses and mechanisms by institutions,\norganisations, machines or apparatus, that lead to the\ngradual atrophy of the former s and addiction to or dependence on the latter s with the consequent control\nor manipulation of human masses and finally leading to some kind of enslavement-The Green-Red \"Revolution\" (which is no re vol u tion) includes then the \"amplified muscle power\" and\nthe \"amplifying the brain power\" (electronics) mentioned by Mr. Sarnoff in his commemoration day\nspeech, that, by the way, have resulted in the atomic\nbomb and in the electronic battlefield used in Vietnam.\nThe GR\" R\" thus leads to waste and pollution,\nfor it creates nothing new, but substitutes all what\nexists in natural balance, for something that is worse\n\" but\" inefficient.\nAnother typical example of the GR\" R\" is the\nadvantage that underdeveloped countries could take\nof the electronic \"revolution\" mentioned by Mr. Sarnoff. Those people affected would have to learn new\nsymbols, means, and kinds of communication thus\natrophying their traditional ones; the developed world\nwould \"naturally\" keep the patents and monopolies,\nthus controlling the kind of \"revolution\" to their own\nadvantage; once a certain number of such devices is\nintroduced, addiction begins to play a role until the\nwhole thing takes the all too familiar form of\n\"under development\".\nAre you involved?

FOR \u00a310' BUT THIS IS WH AT HAPPENED TO ONE LOCAL STUDENT The whole place had an evil\nMany students may remember seeing posters dotted around the university last\n!\nterm offering the opportunity to visit the' USA for40 days with seven days free sightseeing for the spectacular price of \u00a310.\nThis offer was made by an organisation' hitherto unheard of on the Exeter campus called the Unification Church. Towards the end of lost term its disciples were out in force tapping on l hal'l doors with all the ferocity of Jehovah' s Witnesses trying to\nget male students to take up the offer and I, being an obliging fellow, thought that I; migh't try my luck. The disciples of the j organ is at ton withheld all but the very barest! of information regarding the alms of the\nchurch, what I would be doing in the States land where I would be staying; all I was told was to arrive at London airport on a certain date at a certain time and no more. Along with120 other students from various universities im the British Isles, all of\nwhom were extremely puzzled as to quite why and for what purpose they had done so, I arrived 'as requested at the airport. The first disconcerting thing to happen was when my passport was returned with an \" indefinite\" entry visa to the USA stamped upon it but there was no time to think about it as I enjoyed the drunken bliss of the\nfree alcohol on' a iPa nAm charter flight. The next unusual occurrence was at Kennedy Airport. As we emerged from customs we were surrounded by hundreds of singing New York teenagers, cameras clicked everywhere and a carnation was pinned to our' breasts with the words\" Welcome English i students leaders o'f the new world.\" As we were whisked away to an unknown destination North of New York I thought this might be a last fling attempt to revive the Empire but regretfully I was wrong. We arrived late 'in the evening at at arge estate surrounded by high chain link fencing and barbed wire. As we were shown through the grounds to our living quarters pasta large, foreboding bo use to the music of the\n. incessant cicadas the situation became decidedly sinister. A mature student and ex-captain 'in the guards was later to remark\" I felt an evil presence as I have never felt\none before. The whole place had an atmosphere of evil.\" After' a light meal we were shown to our l;iving quarters. The conditions in these can be described as nothing short of appalling: bunk beds were crammed into every conceivable space of a very small house, there were two flush lavatories and three sinks between approximately180 people, there was no air conditioning or mosquito nets \u2014\nvery necessary for the New York summer \u2014\nand no room Whatsoever for the keeping of\none's personal effects. However, it was late\nin the evening and after a day's travelling through timezones most of us were too tired to care much about this, to notice the timetable we were given, the book of \" Unification songs\", the fact that we had been divided into groups of ten which included two leaders from the church, and that we would be woken at 6 a.m. for early morning physical exercise.40 DAYS IN THE U.S.A.( July-August)\nFOR \u00a310\nINTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP TRAINING\n* Stay at Belvedere, New York\n* Study divine principle\n* Seven days sightseeing\nSOME PLACES ARE STILL LEFT, SECOND\nAND THIRD YEAR, AND POSTGRADUATE,\nMALE STUDENTS RESIDENT IN BRITISH\nISLES ONLY\u2014'PLEASE WRITE OR PHONE\nIMMEDIATELY:\nNicola Barlow,\n1 M'arlowe Road,\nCambridge.

Forever buzzing, people stamped up and down the wooden cori dor s of our cramped dormitories, lights went on and off, and there was a continual hum of voices \u2014 all night long! At6 a.m. prompt we were all wo i ken by members of the church who called themselves\" the family\", and whom we called the zombies, and our training course for\" world leadership\" had begun. Our duty, as the church intended it, was one hour's morning exercise, followed by half an hour of \" divine service\" and prayer, followed by three hours of lectures, followed by various\" events\" in the evening such as\na woman with witch like features going into\nhysteric mystic spasms. We were never to\nbe allowed to leave the estate, anything we needed would be brought in for us, were never to be allowed a moment's personal time for things such as letter writing, were never to be allowed to leave our groups with whom we slept, ate and talked incessantly, or our leaders one of whom continually provoked conversation and the other who said nothing but sli ent ly observed us. There was to be no smoking or drinking. The\" lectures\" turned out to be a complete fiasco.120 English students brought up to question everyone and everything were expected to sits lien t ly and not ask questions as they listened to the\" Divine Principles\" of the church which can only be\ndescribed as one of the most unintelligent readings of the bible combined with an admixture of Eastern philosophies and which I hasten to add was, in its own way, ext rem ely attractive and appealing. We were expected to attend this three day lecture course not once but three times! In between these lectures there were ones entitled\" Vic tory over Communism\" and they had also arranged visiting ones from the top professors of Yale, Harvard and Prince town to\nwhom we were introduced as 1 2 0 Oxbridge students. It is perhaps necessary to mention here that everything we did or said was filmed and taped. It goes without saying that within a week we were' 'in revolt at this treatment. Being English students we soon had our own committee demanding its rights, the lecture courses virtually collapsed and most of us spent more time in the local town than on the estate. At one time the situation neared physically violent conflict but under orders from\" the top\" the\" family\" capitulated. However, having failed with one method of\nwhat can be called nothing less than a calculated attempt to brainwash us, the family tried another. This time the hitherto unseen, young and sometimes attractive female members of the family were made to find any personal problems we might have and we were g'iven a jolly goodtime sightseeing all over New York State. Most of us saw through this scheme, unfortunately some did not.\nDay by day who the family were and what they were trying to do revealed itself.\nThey are an organisation trying to takeover the world and run it under the commandments of a53 year old divorcee, multimillionaire and meg lo maniac called Mr. Sun Myung Moon, who the family believes is\nChrist returned. They confidently predict that the USA will be in their power by1980 By Ray Kemp Exeter Un and already have many friends in high places. The family members come from over40 nations quantitatively more from the patriarchal ones such as Germany and Japan who seem particularly susceptible to\nthe church' s brainwashing techniques. They have ail had the treatment to such la degree that no matter what country they come from they all 'speak English 'in the same vo'ice and broken South Korean tongue of Mr. Moon. 'They are all under thirty, dressed in lounge suits whatever 'they 'are doing, immaculately groomed, and have huge and permanent artificial smiles. After two week sIlas lk ed to leave and because I had been noted as a troublemaker, within24 hours I was on a scheduled flight back to England. i Four other people flew home with me and some went up to the Canadian tobacco harvests. Of those that remained after I had left none were allowed home until they had completed the 4 0 day treatment course, unless they were prepared to pay for# ie flight themselves which, most of them,' actively discouraged from taking money with them by the church, could not do. When the40 day course was over the church did not get as many converts as it\nmight have liked but lit 'did get la few and I have no doubt that there are now a good many students who have returned home with severe psychological problems \u2014 1 personally saw one perfectly ordinary Cambridge student brought to a state Of nervous breakdown within ten days. If it sounds as if I had an exciting adventurous summer which you may toe\ntempted to try in 1 9 7 4 \u2014 BE WARNED. This organisation is dangerous, very, very dangerous. It plays upon the intellectual arrogance of the student who believes noone can s way his opinions and' beliefs. But when subjected to extreme psychological pressures, and I would even go so far as to suggest the use of drugged food s,even the strongest will fall.' Don't follow me,'I was lucky, you might not be.

The\nstudents who packed the\nUnion Meeting, however,\nwere in no way \"right-wing reactionaries\" trying to overturn Union Policy as critics on the\nleft would probably like\nthe public to believe.\nThey were by and large\nof a fairly liberal mind themselves, but believe\nresponsible action at IC\nis the best way to\nachieve desired ends.\nThe vote of the Union majority last Thursday\nshould be interpreted as\ndisapproval of the policy\nof confrontation tactics\nadopted at the previous\nUnion m eee ting; one\nwhich many consider to\nhave been unrepresentative of true student sen-time nt. \u2022 Although the\nplan to boycott price\nrises was approved at an\nopen Union meeting, the\noverwhelming vote against the move on November 1st, shows how\nunrepresentative the previous meeting really\nwas. In no way is the decision to accept the 5 %\nincrease and end further\naction against the rise,\nan actual approval of\nprice increases. No one\nreally wants to pay more\nfor anything, especially\nwhen incomes are fr oz en. Students will not tolerate policies which cause more disruption,\ninconvenience, and hot\ntempers, than positive\nresults; especially so,\nwhen such policies are\nmade by unrepresentative bodies.\nGrants the real\nissue\nInsufficient grants are\nthe real issue. As support for a rise in grants\nis unanimous, or nearly\nso (who wants less for\nmore?), the tactics to\nobtain them rather than\nthe issue is the problem\nstudents must overcome.\nScreaming, placard waving demonstrators do not\ncommand respect from\nthe authorities. A more\nrational approach, backed by facts, is required.\nThe college unions in\nconjunction with the\nNUS should prepare well documented reports which detail the discrepancy b^ two en student\ngrants and the cost of\nliving.

Union and college\nrepresentatives should\nthen initiate an intense\nlobbying campaign a mong the MP's and appropriate Government authorities until a firm response is made. Every\nstudent interested in\nhigher grants should\nwrite his MP about the\nproblem. The lobbying\nshould include suggestion of a change in Government priorities, to\nshift more funds into\neducation and away\nfrom less socially useful\nprojects. This is the\nmost reasonable and\ndemocratic approach to\nthe problem. Optimism should be tempered, nev-er the less, as whether we\nlike it or not, students\nare a small minority of\nthe total population, important of course, but\ncompeting for a larger\nslice of an already over-strained budget pie.\nRote of t'. ie Union\nThe Imperial College\nStudent Union could and\nshould be a leading\nforce in the campaign\nfor higher grants. However, instead of proposing productive policies,\nwe have recently seen\nsuch silly resolutions as\na Refectory price boy-c ott. Why has this hap-pen ed? It results basically from a general lack\nof interest in Union Affairs by the majority\nof the student body. This lack of interest is partly\na reaction to the use of\nthe Union by radical activists as a forum to expound their particular\nideologies. Many of us\nare sympathetic to some\nvery liberal causes, but\nreally, what place do im-peri al is m, revolution,\nChile, etc., etc. ad nau-sea, have at a college\nunion meeting? Instead\nof deciding on and rec-om mending action on\nmatters Which directly\nconcern College life, the\nmeetings of late seem\nmore concerned with political rhetoric. At the\nNovember 1st meeting,\nfor example, we were\nimplored to join the revolution against the Tory\nGovernment, and learned that among other\ncauses, increased Refectory prices were a result\nof manipulation of world grain prices by evil capitalists. No wonder students could not be bothered to come to Union meetings.\nAs a first step towards reviving interest\nin Union affairs, let us\nreturn debates of a poli-t ical philosophic nature\nto the political societies\nwhere they belong. The over-reaction and resulting counter-reaction by\nthe Union such as we\nhave seen with the Refectory price issue is of\nbenefit to no one. Let's get on with the real business of student government and make it work\neffectively.\nBy SKIP HOBBS. Petroleum Tech.

The abolition of the Discretionary awards system, i.e.I if a person is accepted as being of the required aca'demic standard to enter a recognised educational establishment, then he/ she should be entitled to an\n\" adequate grant for the period of time required to\n| complete the course of study.13. The recognition of a married woman as being ft n an|d ally independent from her parents, as is at the| moment recognised for a married male student. Ail| married students should receive a full grant.14. To bring the postgraduate awards on to an even| weekly basis to the Undergraduate grant.( A rise in I the region of \u00a3150).\nk5.An increase in government expenditure on student I residence. J6.An increase in the basic grant to put it on a par to\nI that which was deemed necessary by the government of 1962 (i.e. undergraduate grants up by about \u00a3100,\nI and postgraduate awards up by about( \u00a3100 +\u2022 \u00a3150)\n' \u00a3250.)\n\" These above demands by the N.U.S. are the reasons I why YOU should come and support the demonstration f Tomorrow. EVERY student in this college no matter k where his/ her grant comes from is affected in some way I by these demands, and thus this is an ideal opportunity t Cor you to show your support for the campaign. I amI Hure that even the most hardworking of students could? spend one Wednesday afternoon to show that he/she\nI wants to improve the overall standard cl living of all' students. It is useless if you say \" Why^ io ii! dI go out I \u00bbn this demonstration? There will be plenty of others'. ndIa m sure that my presence will have \u2022 absolutely no\n| effect. . . .\" But what happens when even ones^ vs that? I PLEASE COME ON WEDNESDAY AND GIVE US tT HE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING THAT WE HAVE THE FEELINGS OF THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS IN THIS| COLLEGE BE HINDUS. I| Just as a final notice, Noone has yet given me their| I lames for the bonfire at Sil wood on Fr ic1y the9 th\\! November. If sufficient people are interested, we will lay m coaches at minimum expense to take people out J there. The cost will be 4 0 p to those going on their own, k=> nd 35p to those going on the coaches(+ co \u00bb ch fare). I it should be a good evening, and will provide those who J have never been to Sil wood with an ideal opportunity I \u2022>f seeing at least what part of the Field station Is like.

Details of\ntimes, dates, places and wines will be\nrevealed in further instalments. We hope,\nin addition to providing more special-feed tasting s for our 'experts', to introduce as many people as possible to i the delights of the lesser known wines of\nthe world. The society especially intends\nIto show the better quality Italian and\nsecondary French district wines thereby\nintroducing a wide spectrum of moderately priced 'everyday' wines to its\nmembers.\nBy providing the opportunity to taste\nmany more wines than the members\nwould normally encounter in such a short season, the society hopes to increase the enjoyment and appreciation\nd* the vigne ron s' art at Imperial College.\nFirst meeting has now been arranged\nfor Tuesday, 6th November ait 5.45 in\nphysics common room, level 8. Membership at door. The tasting is on Italian\nwine.\nT.C. FELINE, Chairman I. C.W. T.S. CANOE CLUBS FIRST SPLASH\nOn Friday, 26th October the club\ntried to depart for i the weekend ito Symonds Vat on the River Wye. Due to\nheavy traffic and two members getting\nlost between Hammersmith and Ealing\nwe did not depart until 9.30 p.m. We\narrived at the Wye alt 2.00 a.m. due to\nthe driver slipping her clutch. Having\npitched tents and woken up a party of\ncanoeists from Birmingham Univ. we\nsettled down for the night. At the crack\nof dawn, 10.30, everybody suddenly\nleaped out of 'their tents and plunged\ninto the river (Lemmings?). During Saturday and Sunday many things were\nlearnt, i.e. what not to do in an upturned canoe. On Sunday, whilst some\npeople wandered around du lt ching bog\nrolls after catching pneumonia on Staurday, others did more paddling. Overall a95% capsizing was 'achieved.\nThe journey back was uneventful and\nso our first major trip was quite successful. Thanks must go to Maria Assumpta for supplying a cook who\nfailed to poison us.\nJohn & Canoe club committee.\nX \u2014COUNTRY CLUB\nOn Saturday 27th the assembled\nhordes of the UL X Country team, that\nis, 17 of them, and their massed supporters (2 female) were amazed by the\narrival at Malet St. of a grey-green\ncoach\u2014only 10 mins. late! After last\nyear's Oxford match, weren't we all\ndreaming?\nMaybe the relatively prompt appearance Of said coach had, among others,\nfooled our fell-ras e expert, \"first back\nfrom de UL match?\" Kl ry? or maybe it was just the general apathy that\nseemed to have pervaded the I.C. XCountry team. . . .\nAs it was, only superstars Rob, Neil\nand Paul turned up to pit their strength\n(where? where?) against Cambridge\nHare & Hounds. Hours later the coach\narrived at the CH&H headquarters, or\nshack. . . . It was locked and deserted\nbut a pile of infamous CH&H jam\nsandwiches lay in full view\u2014yes! the\nmatch was on! Soon crisp clean purple\nUL vests were being handed out to those\ndeemed worthy enough for the UL1 st and 2nd teams', after all vests like these\ncost \u00a32.50\nAfter much milling around at the top\nof Worts Causeway the 6 mile race\ncommenced. For those not there the\ncourse was described as \"down this 'ere\nRoman Road for a mile, twice round\na two mile lap in the woods spitting on\nthe picnicking couple taking photographs in the car. park as you go, then\nback up Road.\" Needless to say the race was not\nwithout incident: UL1 st team members\ngot lost (O.K. so what's new?), direction arrows were obliterated by Mds\n(ditto), Mike Wignall of U.C. knocked\nover and trod on a be suited gentleman\n(hooligan), Neil knocked over a small\nchild (clumsy) and dogs, pram s and\npedestrians strayed all over the course\nas per usual.\nThe result? Well, Cambridge 1st did\nbeat UL1 st, however, doubtless due to\nthe efforts of Rob, Neil and Paul in being 1st,2 nd and 3rd counters in the UL2 nd team, Cambridge 2nds were defeated\u2014say no more.\nBack again to the looked CH&H shack (whoops, headquarters) and in through an open window\u2014it was the\nsight of,the food officer?? Cos dare I say it? Mooney. can do better!! The\nCambridge runners further compounded\nthis folly by starting ito devour the jam\nsandwiches before changing, hence half\nthe UL team only got biscuits; quicker\noff the mark next time lads.\n'In his haste to depart the UL captain\ncompletely forgot those lovely UL vests\nhe'd so carefully re-collected and only\nafter Martin Del of Cambridge had\nchased the coach for a quarter of a mile were 'they saved from becoming\nCH&H souvenirs. . . . But there was\nmore to come yet. Pausing to slake our\nthirsts at the Lamb& Flag gave the\ncoach its chance to misbehave (after all it had been no trouble so far). We got\n-in . . . the lights dimmed . . . we got\nout . . . we pushed . . . oh memories\nof Birmingham. . . .\nPR N. MOTOR SHOW 1973\nFriday, 16th November 8-00^dawn, College Block\nGUILDS CARNIVAL\nFAIRPORT CONVENTION\nBees Make Honey, Mike Absalom\nAce, Callinan & Flynn\nFilms, Food, Late Bar, Disco\ntickets from Guilds Union Office\nNew version of Mini: The Minissima.\nThis was an unremarkable show, even\nmore unremarkable than last year's if\nsuch a thing lis physically (and gram-mati call y) possible. There were no significant new production models and little\nevidence of new thinking, in some cases\nno signs of thinking at all. Of course\nthere were the Lamborgbinis and similar pieces of exotic machinery, suitably\nadorned with synthetic looking dolly-birds but even these have become an\naccepted part of the Earls Court scenery and few people bother to stop and\nlook.\nAbsent from the show were the\nAmerican armoured leviathans, euphemistically known as Experimental Safety\nVehicles. However, I have it on good\nauthority that the development of these\nmonstrosities is continuing at an ever\nincreasing rate. Of course it is desirable\nto have vehicles that are less vulnerable\nin accidents, but it lis far better to have\nless accidents. In any case the majority\nof road casualties are pedestrians,\nshould not their safety be a greater priority than the protection of the motorist\nfrom his own mistakes?\nOne brilliant idea, which has not received nearly as much publicity as it\ndeserves is the Avon Safety Wheel (see\nbottom picture). It is one of those concepts which is so simple that it amazes\nme that no-one thought of it before.\nThe main danger with a conventional\nwheel (left) is that should the tyre lose\nair at speed, one bead will find its way\ninto the well used for fitting the tyre\nand the fitting process will occur in re\nverse, rapidly removing the tyre. The\nAvon wheel (right) prevents this happening simply by having a metal band\nto fill in Ithe well when the tyre lis fin\nplace, both beads are pushed over to\none side of the rim to allow the band\nto be clipped into position before in fla tion. Should the tyre blow out the fact\nthat it is kept on i the rim makes it possible to safely stop the vehicle and\nchange the wheel.\nObviously this does not constitute a run-flat system, as does the much publicised Dunlop Denovo, but it is far\nsimpler, does not require special (and\nvery expensive) tyres, and can be fitted\nto any car or light van (not just those\nwith power steering). The performance\nin case of a tyre depress u rising at speed\nis equally effective, and in any case how\nmany people really want to drive 'up\nto 100 miles at speeds of up to 50 mph'\non a damaged and deflated tyre?\nAnother good idea, which regrettably\nis not yet ready for production is the\nBritish Leyland Minissima town oar\n(see below). The prototype uses the run\nning gear of a standard Mini but due\nto the light weight of the car electric\npropulsion lis a feasible proposition. The\noverall length is only 90 inches, three\nquarters that ol fa Mini, nevertheless the\nvehicle is a four seater with the t we rear passengers slitting sideways facing\nthe middle, i the one door being at the\nback.\nMaserati Khcmsin.\n\u00a31.30 in advance \u00a31.50 on door\n\u2022 V \u2022\n<\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\nOrdinary and Avon Safety Wheel.\n\n"

Pelican Classic\n(published 25th October). 75p.On Sunday 1st April1649, a group\nof poor men collected at St. George'sHill, Walton-upon-Thames, and began\nto dig the wasteland, sowing corn, par-snips, carrots and beans; and in so\ndoing Gerrard Winstanley and his fellow Diggers established the first communist colony. They maintained that the\nfeudal lords' rights to the commons and\nwastelands had been cut off with King Charles' head.\nThe colony struggled against continuous harassment from the local pro-per ty owners. Legal attacks in the\ncourts at Kingston were complemented\nby more blatant raids in which crops\nand huts were destroyed, animals killed,\nand people beaten. A boycott was\norganised to bring financial pressure\nto bear, and on more than one occasion troops were called in to assist in the ransacking. Nevertheless the commune managed to survive a full year,\nwith similar settlements of Diggers in at\nleast nine other English counties.\nThe Digger (or True Leveller) move-ment, representing a growing number\nof proper tiles s, was the most radical\nwithin the English revolution. Their\ndirect actions towards bringing the land\nunder community' control came at a time when the radical threat to the\nnew bourgeois order under Cromwell\nhad not yet been defeated. The most\nimportant group on the left were in fact\nthe Levellers, a strongly democratic\nmovement of the petit-bourgeoisie, who however did not on the whole support\nthe Diggers' communist doctrines.\n\" The Law of Freedom and Other\nWritings\" contains political pamphlets\nby Gerrard Winstanley, written on\nbehalf of the St. George'sHill Diggers,\nas well as other major works of social\ncriticism. Most of his ideas on religion,\nthe Church, education and government\nare progressive by modern standards,\nand on the land question, which he\nregarded central to all issues, he would\nclearly be a revolutionary today. He wanted a non-competitive, communal\nsociety, insisting that political freedom\nis impossible without economic equality,\nwhich could only be attained by the\nabolition of private property and wage\nlabour.\nHe writes in a vigorous, refreshing\nstyle, with a deep sense of justice that\ncan't fail to inspire the reader. The book\nis wholeheartedly recommended.\nChristopher Hill, who in such books\nas \" The English Revolution 1640\" has\ndone much to counter the school history book version of the seventeenth\ncentury, has written a lucid intro duc tion. Winstanley and the Diggers are put\nin their political and historical context,\nand Winstanley is thoroughly assessed\nfrom a philosophical and literary stand-point. The introduction itself warrants\nbuying the book.\nJOE HERBERT SON, Met. PG. NOT QUITE DEAD\nThe two albums reviewed below have\nboth been out for some time and have\nfaded from obscurity to total obscurity\nin the meanwhile. No doubt they will\nbe deleted in due course so now is your\nchance to grab two brilliant albums.\nMICKEY HART: ROLLING THUNDER( Warner Bros.)\nMickey Hart was a drummer with\nthe Grateful Dead from 1967 to 1971\nand though no longer playing gigs with\nthe band he has obviously kept in touch\nwith West-coast musicians as well as\nbranching out with Indian influences.\nWith Mickey Hart on the album are\nmost of the Dead, Grace Slick, Steve\nStills, John Cippofina, David Frleberg\nand many others.\nA number of star names shoved together do not guarantee excellence and\ncould easily degenerate into just the\nopposite but Mickey Hart is in full\ncontrol and the music is subtly and\ncompletely co-ordinated.\nThe contents are varied, ranging from\nIthe harmonies of \"Playing in the\nBand\" to the brilliant tabla of \" Gran ma's Cookies\". Side 1 ends with close\nharmonies and delicate instrumentation\non \" Blind John\", Grace Slick's voice\nlurks in the background merging with\nboth the vocals and the music. Side 2\nincludes \"Deep, wide and frequent\" featuring the \"Tower of Power Horn Section'\" and Cippolina's guitar in a bright\njazzy number.. 'Pump Song' naturally\nincludes a pump as part of the ry hl hm section and this works surprisingly well.\nThe vocals here are Bob Wier's, appropriately enough since it's his song and\nmakes an appearance on his own 'solo'\n.il ii um as \" The: Greatest Story Ever,\nTold\". My favourite track is \"Fletcher\nCat na by\" where distorted vocals combine with horns to produce a unique\nand beautiful sound.\nOverall this is a tremendous album\nwith no track to fault it. Don't miss it\na second time round.\nBOB WIE R:ACE( Warner Bros.)\nSupposedly a solo album by Bob\nWier of the Grateful Dead but in fact\nincludes all the Dead.\nThe immediate thing you notice about\nthis album is how very relaxed it is.\nThe musical precision is up to the\nDead's usual high standard but technical brilliance is combined with a strongly tangible enjoyment of what they are\ndoing.\nThe tracks are characteristic Grateful Dead material of the current 'vin-t age'. All are written by Bob Wier with\nlyrics by Robert Hunter or Ron Barlow.\nA lively version of \" The Greatest\nStory Ever Told\" opens the album.\n\" Black Throated Wind\" and \" Looks Like Rain\" move along in low gear and\nare characteristically introspective. Side\n1 ends with a beautiful and lyrical version of \"Playing in the Band\", this is\nwhat the Grateful Dead are all about.\nSide 2 includes the definitely non-bluesy \" Mexicali Blues\" and \" One more\nSaturday Night\" which blasts along full\nof the party spirit. The album ends\nwith \"Cassidy\", an enchanting song\nwhich again depends on the perfect\ncombination of vocal and music which\nthe Dead always achieve.\nThe addition of Keith Godchaux on\nPiano makes a great improvement to\nthe 'sound' of the band but it is a pity\nthat Donna Godchaux. is not more pro-mine nt, more often, on \"chick vocals\".\nAgain this is an excellent album \u2014\nas the song says \"the one thing we\nneed is a left-hand monkey wrench\".\nRICHARD SZ C ZEP AN SKI \"The Naked Face\"\nSidney Sheldon, Pah30 pI Well, you know how it is . . I' d'j just sat down after a long dreary day,\nand while the macaroni cheese was\nhaving a quick seethe in the oven I decided to relax with a couple of chapters of The Naked Face', \"just another\ndet eot jive mystery story\", I thought.\nAt one a.m., crawling into bed with\nfingernails bitten to the quick, I thought otherwise. This book is dan-gero us. Don't start it unless you're sure\nof a couple of hours to yourself, and don't give it to anyone whose company\nyou can't do without for a while. It's hot stuff, fast moving, and the best\nstraightforward thriller I 've read this\nyear. ( CAN DI) Record Review\nFocus: AT THE RAINBOW( Polydor 2442 118)\nSide 1\n(1) Focus III\n(2) Answers? Questions! Questions?\nAnswers!\n(3) Focus II.\nSide 2\n(1) Eruption (Excerpt)\n(2) Hocus Pocus\n(3) Sylvia\n(4) Hocus Pocus (Reprise)\nI saw Focus live about a year ago,\njust as they were breaking through in this country. A flat mate already owned\nthe two Focus albums available at that\ntime, and so I was familiar with their\nrecorded work. The live performance\nconvinced me that they had a lot more\nto offer than had been apparent from\ntheir studio material, and I know that\nthis opinion is shared by most of the\n'hard core' Focus fans. Once they had\nestablished themselves both here and in America it was inevitable that a live\nalbum would be released, and here it\nis. It was recorded on May5 th of this\nyear at The Rainbow Theatre, with the\nmaterial coming from the Moving\nWaves and Focus III albums.\nThe first side opens with Focus HI, a gentle track from the Focus III album.\nThis comes over very nicely, following\nthis is Answers? Questions! Questions?\nAnswers!, also from the Focus Hi album. This track features some furious guitar playing from J anAk ker man. The first side closes with Focus\nII, which again comes across well.\nSide two features the 'Eruption'\ntheme from the Moving Waves album,\nand is followed by a speedy version\nof the favourite Hocus Pocus. On this\ntrack they seem to lose cohesiveness,\nbecause they strive to play too quickly.\nA burst of applause signifies the end\nof the set, and Sylvia is provided as an encore. For me, this is the best track\noff the album, and is superbly de liv ered. The end of Sylvia blends into a reprise of Hocus Pocus.\nTo be quite honest, I was a little bit\ndisappointed with the album, and do not think it really captured them at\ntheir best. Iam not an ardent Focus\nfan, and hence may be a little bit too\ncritical.\nThe album is an absolute must for all\nFocus fans, and anybody interested in them at all should give the album a careful listen. A final point, for any Hi Fi buffs who may listen to the album,\nis that the recording itself is not absolutely first class. Suffice it to say T have heard better recordings of live\nmaterial.\nG.P. BALFOUR HAPPY DEATH\nAlbert Camus, Penguin 25p. This book published posthumously\nwill be identified by many as a text in which Camus failed to find cohesion,\nabandoned as a book but which is\nvery interesting is understanding the\ndevelopment of the outsider.\nAs in The Outsider the book opens\nwith Patrice Mersault, whose story is\nto learn of a murder and ends with his\nown death.\nHis story is of the experiment he\nmakes out of his life, a search for hap-pines s, the only ideal he recognises and\nwhich leads him on a alienated journey\nin per suit of this misunderstood concept.\nAt no point in the book is Camus'\ncreative sense in Construction of phrase\nand sentence anything but his own excellent best. Different scenes however\nare not brought together well leaving\nthem, though individually highly developed, isolated and uncertain. This I believe to have been Camus' own opinion which led him to give up work on the book, but then later to bring the\nideas, the driving force of this work.\nto fruition in his accepted classic 'The\nOutsider'.\nSome of the opening scenes are indeed\nidentical with corresponding ones in\nThe Outsider, though Camus seems to\nhave done more than change his presentation of his ideas, certainly the emphasis and possibly the ideas have changed\nbetween the books.\nIt was interesting to find Mersault\nwhen finally able to begin his experiment having left all his connections with\nthe past, undergoing experiences which\nhave a flavour extremely close to those\ntasted lin Sartres \"Nausea\".\nIt would seem the person unacquainted with Camus, Nobel Laureate, would\ndo better to read one of his established\nclassics if only because they will find\nmore people with whom they \"can discuss the book whereas this book must\nhold most of its interest in being additional material to study Camus and his\nliterature.\nGREG BURL AN B J5C9B\nFri. 9 Nov.
