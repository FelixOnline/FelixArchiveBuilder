    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY14 TH FEBRUARY NEWS FEATURE 11\nWould the real\nMr Caldwell\nplease step\nforward\nIan Caldwell is not 41. That is the sum knowledge of most people at Imperial\nCollege about the incumbent of one of the administrative division's most powerful posts. Luckily for you, the denizens of Imperial College, Felix was able to\nsnatch an impromptu interview with the Director of Estates whilst he visited our\nOffice on a slightly different pretext...\nMr Caldwell is, as is apparent to anyone who has spoken with him, a Glaswegian by right of birth, though his resistance to a permanent record of\nhis voice or visage outliving him testify to a little bit of vanity that is uncommon in a Scot. Although trained as an architect by the University of\nStrathclyde, Mr Caldwell's early forays in to the blueprint and set-square profession gave way to a desire to be in the commissioning side of building\ndesign. This eventually led to Sheffield Hallam University where, as Director\nof Estates, he helped revolution is e the campus design. Mr Caldwell was at\nSheffield for three years before moving to his present post as Director of\nEstates at Imperial College.\nHe has now been here for three years...\nDo you enjoy working here?\n[Long pause] I would describe it as challenging, but basically, yes. It is a stimulating environment in which to work, not only because of the academic\nenvironment but also for the high standards that are expected. When you first\nwalk on campus, all you see are sixties problems, that cannot easily be solved.\nBut with the medical mergers there is greater opportunity to resolve some of\nthese problems, and have a much bigger impact on the future of the College.\nThe hierarchy here is much better than many other universities. IC is much\nmore consensus led than many institutions, and I think that this has caused\nproblems for some staff who are used to a more tiered management structure.\nI would add to that and say that College has a bloody good team who are brave\nenough to admit mistakes.\nHow has your role within the College changed while you have been here?\n[Even longer pause] There is much more focus on planning now, and\nthough there have been great improvements, the every day organisation is not\nquite there. You have to realise that there is never going to be enough money\nto do what we would like, but we are now beginning to understand our priorities much better. There is an assumption that students and staff want to work\nin a place of quality.\nWhen you look out of the window, what do you see?\nThe image that is generated by the College can be related that created by\nother institutions, for example, the Queen's Lawn can be compared with the\nGreat Lawn of MIT, or the University of Technology in Hong Kong.\nWhen, if ever, you leave here, what do you want to be remembered for?\nI have no plans to leave just yet! [Long pause] I think that I would like to\nfeel that I would have achieved something different. But there are perhaps two\nmain things I would like to do. Firstly, I would really like to develop a partnership between the Estates Division and the academic departments; try and\nachieve a better understanding of each other and what departments need from\nus. For example, the lecture theatre and research lab refurbishment over the\npast few summers. Ideally, the project managers should also have better relationships with the departments. I think that Estates can be the intellectual\nequal, in its field, to the academic departments.\nSecondly, I would like to leave something that people wouldn't have\nexpected. At Sheffield, there was a major space created on the campus that I was involved in designing and initiating that helped unify how the university\nworked. They believe that I left something worthwhile. I haven't yet had anything named after me though!\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\nI like to spend a lot of time with my family: at weekends, we often go to art\ngalleries or restaurants. I particularly like modern and innovative places, such\nas the Tate. I am quite interested in the design of buildings and how they use\ntheir space and dimensions. One of my children (Mr C has two sons aged 11\nand 16) is just choosing his A Levels; he wants to study interior design and so\nis interested in this use of space too.\nWhat sort of music do you listen to?\nI love Buddy King and Chicago Blues, though I have a broader range of\nmusic I enjoy such as Elton John and jazz. And I saw Carmen at the Royal\nAlbert Hall last night.\nBeing more general about my taste, I would like a Morgan car [/ indicate\nmy lack of car about my person].\nDo you think that Scotland have a chance of winning the Five Nations?\n[Laughs] We will be back! We may not win this year, but in the future we\nwill have built up a good team, and then we'll definitely win!\nWhere do you see the College going in the future?\nPhysically, it will not be where it is now. I imagine that there will be more\nchanges in the estate than we can predict, though more integration with some\nof the medical sites would be inevitable as more of the departments undertake\nintegrated research. You might foresee a time when certain departments have\noutstations within the medical sites.\nOne of the biggest challenges for the estate is the RSM building. Basically,\nit is in poor shape, out of step with modern thinking and inefficient with its\nspace. But to restructure the RSM would take millions, which we simply don't have. We will always be short of cash.\nAs for mergers and acquisitions, there are unlikely to be any more mergers,\nand though there will be far greater co-operation between the South\nKensington institutions, we are not going to absorb the Science Museum, for\nexample. There will be cross fertilisation of ideas, and more joint seminar programmes and other sorts of linked activity. College needs to become more\nknown to, and more open with, the local community generally, not just the\nmuseums.\nHow do students now compare to when you were a student?\nWell, beer was cheaper, but generally students are more mature now...\nEditor's note: Interview based on discussion around question topics\nAnswers to questions sl toul d not be taken as direct quotes.\nWords and pictures: Alex.\n\n"

FULL STORY NEXT WEEK FELIX FRIDAY14 TH FEBRUARY First medical open day\nPHOTO: WAN LING LI Visitors examine the winners of the 1997 Hunting Art Prizes, works by\nnew British artists on display at the Royal College of Art until Sunday.\nSurprise candidates\nenliven Sabbatical race\ncontinued from front page\nHead talked the prospective medical\nstudents through two admission\ninterview case-studies, in an attempt\nto de mystify this most dreaded part\nof the selection procedure.\nFinally, brief presentations were\ngiven by Eric Allsop, Sami Ansari,\nand Nitesha Singh, Student Union\npresidents of Imperial College, St\nMary's Hospital Medical School,\nand Charing Cross and Westminster\nMedical School respectively.\nTogether, they emphasised the extensive recreational facilities provided\nfor students by the College and drew\nattention to the sports teams, clubs\nand societies that the medics could\nenjoy within their own Constituent\nCollege Union.\nDr Shaw then fielded a brief question and answer session concerning\nthe new curriculum. Questions related to other aspects of the course, particularly those pertaining to present\nmedical students, were answered\nduring the rest of the day while\nprospective students were taken on a tour of the South Kensington cam-pus. This was followed by a visit to\nthe two main teaching hospitals, St\nMary's and Charing Cross. At St\nMary's Hospital, the large party of\nsixth-former s learned of the proud\ntradition of the hospital and its medical school in sporting achievements\nand other activities during a talk by\nMr Robin Touquet, a consultant surgeon in accident and emergency.\nThe open day was jointly organised by the ICSM and the Student\nUnions of Imperial College, St\nMary's Hospital Medical School and\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nMedical School. Some preparations\non the South Kensington campus\nwere a little improvised, the ICU\nexecutive having been informed of\nthe event only the night before.\nHowever, most of the visitors,\nincluding the tutors who accompanied their students on the open day,\nmade the most of the the opportunity\nto chat to the medics. The principal\nconcern expressed by the prospective\nstudents was that their less than outstanding GCSE grades would jeo pardi se their chance of winning a place\nat the medical school, and that they\nmight not have chosen the correct\nsubjects at A level to study medi-cine.\nNEWS TEAM The final week of nominations for\nthe 1997 Sabbatical Elections has\nseen unprecedented activity amongst\npotential candidates jockeying for\nprominence. A number of submitted\nand then withdrawn candidature s have further confused the election\nrace. Today, the cie ad line passes lor\nmembers of Imperial College Union\nwishing to run for election to a sabbatical position to sign their names\non the nomination papers. Last\nminute nominations are expected as\nseveral rumours of eleventh hour\ncandidates, possibly including a medical student, abound.\nAt the time of going to press, six\nfully proposed and seconded candidates are standing for the four\nSabbatical posts. Two candidates\nhave stood for the posts of Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services) and\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties, whilst there remains a single candidate each for the posts of\nFelix Editor and President. New\nElection, the option for voters\nunconvinced that the candidates arc\nsuitable for the job, is also standing\nfor every post.\nThis second week of nominations\nhas seen some surprise candidates\ncome forth and secure the full compliment of twenty second ers and a proposer. Samantha Baker, a third\nyear chemist, is currently unopposed\nfor the position of President after\nJohnathan Austin, a fourth year\nphysicist, and Andrew Guilder, a third year mechanical engineering\nstudent withdrew their candidature s. In an unsual turn of events. Mr\nGuilder withdrew his candidature by\nscrawling \"No thank you. Cheers for\nthe support\" across his paper early\non Thursday morning despite his\nsecuring of seventeen second ers. Elsewhere, fourth year civil engineering student Duncan Tindall is\nvying with chemical engineer John\nSavery, also in his fourth year, for\nthe post of DP (F&S). Smita\nChaturvedi, biochemistry II, and\nSarah Thomas, chemical engineering\nIV, are competing for the post of\nDP(C&S). Jeremy Thomson, a third\nyear physicist is sole candidate for\nthe post of Felix Editor.\nWith nominations closing at 6 pm\nthis evening, there is still opportunity for last minute candidates to come\nforward. Rumours persist that two\n'heavyweight' candidates will sign\nup for the top post of President, with\nsome suggestions of a stage-man-aged nomination just before the\ndeadline.\nHUMANITIES PROGRAMME 1997 - 1998\nWould you like some help with selecting your Humanities Option for\nthe next academic year?

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY14 TH FEBRUARY Simon Baker - Voice of Reason\nthe Cupid role, are bending over\nbackwards to accommodate this special interest body of students and\nmake the marriage work. The\nICSMU, smaller than\nRCS, will get as much\nfunding as all the current unions put\ntogether. The BMS has provision for\nsocial space, a feature that is somewhat sparse in\nevery other depart-ment. This again\nwill allow the\nmedics to remain in\ntheir shiny new build\ning without the need\nfrater n is e. The only\nwe will see them is\nFriday night in the\nSouthside, and God help the consequences. For reasons best known to them-selves, medics are a fiercely independent bunch the world over. They are\nvery big on their identity, which is\nwhy they feel they have everything\nto lose from this merger. They resent\ninterference and intrusion by out-side rs,a point that was made all too\nclear to me and other IC students last\nyear when attending lectures at\nMary's. An explanation of\nthis somewhat fanatical\nbehaviour was offered\none of the pharmacology lecturers,\nwho suggested it\nwas a school in\nevery sense of the\nword, with greater\ncos set ing of the\nstudents the result\nbeing that, in his\nwords, the equivalent age group at IC\nwere more mature. This\nhostility towards IC\nx tends to the very highest\nlevels of the medical schools. In St\nMary's magazine, there have been\nletters of complaint from all and\nsundry, culminating in an open letter\nto the Queen Mother. The only thing\nthat unites them all is that they don't want to be united.\nAs days go by, this is looking\nmore and more like empire building\n:\nM Westminster EyeI\nHg Hamish Common\nEverything seemed fairly quiet on\nthe medical front a few weeks ago.\nThe BMS was rising majestically and\non schedule (after a fashion), and little had been heard from St Mary's. Then news came of a deal struck by\ni the medics to secure direct funding\n|from College to the tune of \u00a380,000\nIper year. This will indeed further\ni alienate the medical students within\nj the body of IC, but that is precisely\n| what they want.\nI To describe the merger of St\nj Mary's, Charing Cross, NHLI and\nj Royal Postgraduate medical schools\nlas a shotgun wedding doesn't even\nj come close to the mark. For anyone\n|new to the South Ken campus, let me\nj explain the gist of recent events.\nIMary's do not like Imperial, and dis-l like being reminded of the fact they\n| themselves have been part of IC\nj since1988. Imperial do not like\nMary's. Mary's do not wish to merge\nwith the other medical schools, and\nthey in turn want nothing to do with\nMary's IC, or each other. In short,\nthis is tribal warfare. Since no one\nlikes anyone else in this shambles,\ni College senior management, playing\nOne area of public spending doesn't seem attract much interest from stu-dents, apart from the odd comment\nthat in a modern society we don't really need one any more: Britain's Armed Forces.\nThe arguments for a serious\nrethink on our defence forces are\nstrong. The annual budget stands at\n\u00a324 billion, enough for a quite a lot\nof hospitals and schools. It employs a few hundred thousand people, plus\ncountless others in industries including arms and aeronautics companies.\nThere will certainly be people reading this who will be going into such\nindustries themselves. The broad\nquestion of arms is a horrendously\ncomplex one, not made any easier by\nthe emotional issues attached to it.\nArms companies are usually pac i fists' and socialists' Enemy No 1,\nwith the supply of totalitarian and\nrepressive regimes regarded with justified disgust - although I wonder\nhow many people from Imperial who\nwere offered a highly paid job with\none of them would turn it down for\nthese reasons.\nLabour's Defence Spokesman,\nDavid Clark, has been quietly agreeing with most of Government\ndefence policies. Labour has a political legacy including policies for partial or complete destruction of our\nnuclear arsenal, swing eing cutbacks\nin all three forces, leaving NATO\nand so on. This is all now considered\ntoo dangerous, and Labour have\nrecently kept quiet on the subject.\nClark has said a few things though:\nmembership of NATO, maintaining\nTrident (our nuclear submarine fleet)\nand our permanent seat on the UN Security Council will all be \"non-negotiable\".\nI believe the general argument for\naxing vast portions of the Armed\nForces goes something like this: in a modern society, we do not need these\nweapons of war. No-one is likely to\nattack us - we now enjoy close relations with Germany, the last country\nwe fought within our borders. But\nanyway if they do the United States\nwill help us out, and we'll keep\nsomething in reserve just in case.\nMany people may not say this openly but feel in their heart of hearts that\nthis is the case.\nUnfortunately, the world doesn't really work like that. Since the collapse of Communism, the standard\nEast versus West confrontation has\nbeen replaced by a much more complicated situation, with instability\nand power vacuums in countless\nareas across the world. It is vital that\na country with enormous world interests such as the UK does not seek\nsolace in itself - every time relatively\npowerful countries become isolation-ist, ignoring the affairs of others, foreign powers will see what they can\nget away with. Hitler took over most\nof the European continent this way -Russia invaded Afghanistan this\nway, Argentina invaded the\nFalklands this way, and the fighting\nfactions in Bosnia consistently tested\nNATO's patience to the limit this\nway. I am not arguing that world\norder would collapse if we scrapped\na few missiles, but that we must\nshow the world quite clearly that we\nwon't watch on the sidelines while\natrocities are committed and islands\nand areas of the world under British\nrule - who wish to remain Britishare attacked. This clear attitude lies at\nthe forefront of our nuclear policy.\nThe world knows that Britain has at\nleast one submarine afloat with the\ncapability to launch an attack on any\npart of the world at any time. This\nwould make anyone considering\nusing chemical or biological\nweapons against British troops, or\nconsidering attacking the UK mainland itself, think twice.\nLet us say this or an incoming\nGovernment accepted these broad\nterms: how could they cut defence?\nEven a5% cut would release billions\nof pounds. Unfortunately they are\nby IC. Forget the cost and to hell\nwith the consequences. The BMS\nbuilding amazingly manages to fill\nevery available square inch, preventing expansion by anyone else, clear\nevidence that it was built on the basis\nof getting the largest building that the\nplanners will allow- stick it up, then\nthink what to do with it. Only the\nBiology department have, to date,\nsupplied plans of what facilities are\nneeded. Even by IC standards, this\nain't good.\nAs you would imagine on a job of\nthis size, there will be penalty payments for late completion. Very sensible you say. Oh dear. The penalty\npayments are \u00a321,000 per day late.\nNot to be paid by Schal to us, mind.\nOh no, this will be paid to the\nTreasury by IC. The blok e that came\nup with that stunning deal was probably head hunted from the British\nLibrary project. It will, therefore,\nopen on time.With the integration of\nCharing Cross and the others likely\nto be as sham boli c as Mary's, prepare for much more chaos. This, as\nsomeone once said, is going to run\nand run.\nfinding it very difficult to cut any-thing. Trident is practically paid for,\nso scrapping it would kill off a major\npart of the UK's personal defence\nwithout any pecuniary advantage.\nThe same can be said of Eurofighter\n- an essential project if only to show\nthat countries other the States are\ncapable of building hi-tech weapon-ry. All forces have been cut to the\nbone, with observers commenting\nthat we would not have the resources\nto launch another Falklands opera-tion. More adventurous ideas have\nbeen suggested: merging the Royal\nMarines with the Army, scrapping\nthe RAF (!) and merging them with\nNaval and Army air arms. We could\nlose the tanks - attack helicopters do\nthe job just fine. We don't need long\nrange bombers - cruise missiles will\nfit the role quite nicely.\nAlthough such suggestions may\ncause hernias in defence chiefs and\ninvite ridicule from various quarters,\ntough decisions will have to be made.\nIndustry bosses and trade unions will\nlobby strongly against any cuts, with\nsome places employing tens of thousands of people on one (albeit large)\nsite. But even the milder plan for\nmore European integration could\nsave \u00a33 -\u00a34 billion pounds annually.\nAs John Reed of 'Defence Industry'\nsays: \"the risk is that in trying to get\nthe best of both worlds they will end\nup with the worst of both, and that\nthe real day of decision will be post-pone d.\" "

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 14TH FEBRUARY\nFELIX SPORT\nCambridge killed by IC gunmen\nIn the first competition of the season,\nthe IC magnificent seven (plus Lee\n\"Incredibly hunk y and talented\"\nClements) blasted their way to victory over the Cambridge to ffs. The competition opened with\nJacob \"the Horn\" Thorne stepping\nup against the best shooters that\nCambridge had to offer. Not intimidated in the least, Jacob coolly shot\nthe string that held the four targets up\n- sending them to the floor and the\nCambridge team into disarray.\nFollowing the fiercely fought battle\nin .22 pistol, featuring millimetre\nprecision from the likes of \"Dead-eye\" Dick Day and Mike \"Ice-cool\"\nZethrin, the competition moved onto\nfull bore pistol. Here the true IC skill\nshone through. As Graham-the-kid\nand Jon \"Nutter\" McCartney peppered the bullseye, their team took it\nupon themselves to leave their own\nmarks - on the carpet.\nAs the display of cool nerve and\nsteady arm continued the IC squad\nwas forced to dig deep against a late\ncomeback but it was too late. The\nresult was inevitable - glory for IC.\nIC 3943 - 3675 Cambridge\nMighty IC rule the waves\nThe first head race of the season saw\nImperial crews sweep the opposition\naway with apparent ease at the\nPeterborough Head of the Nene. The\npre-Christmas training camp and\nhard winter work is obviously starting to pay dividends, with the men's crews claiming the top four positions\noverall in the morning's2.7 km warm-up race, backed up by division\nwins for the men's novice four (tenth\noverall) and women's open cox less four (eighteenth overall). The 4.2km eights race in the afternoon presented\nthe women the sternest test in the\nshape of the Cambridge blue boat.\nHolding a higher rate of striking then\ntheir light blue opponents over the\nwhole course, IC looked sharper and\nmore focused than the larger\nCambridge girls, which showed in\nthe fantastic result, IC winning by a clear six seconds over the University\nof London, with Cambridge down in\nthird place. The men's crews were up\nagainst more feeble opposition in the\nshape of the Cambridge lightweights,\nand beat them by a suitable margin to\ntake first and second overall. The\nwomen's second eight couldn't quite\nmanage to beat their opposite numbers from Cambridge, but still came\naway with victory in their division.\nBoth men's and women's novice\neights raced competitively, but were\nboth beaten by Cambridge college\nfirst eights.\nThe women's crews now shape up\nto take on Cambridge head-to-head\nat Henley on Sunday where they\nhope for a repeat victory. The men's squad continues with preparations\nfor National squad selection(first\neight) and a trip to Ireland (second\nand third eights) with the women's first eight to take on Trinity College\n(Dublin), University College\n(Dublin) and the tough Irish club,\nNeptine.\nLast weekend the novice men\nwent to Burway on a mission to\nredeem themselves after a mediocre\nshowing in the eights a Peterborough. The A crew won by\nmiles, leaving the B crew in second\nplace but still 30 seconds clear of the\nnearest opposition.\nOverall, not a bad start to the year!\nRCS sent packing by baggage handlers\nA disappointing turn-out resulted in\nRCS meeting the luggage-lugging\nlard-arse s with only thirteen men.\nAfter borrowing two players we\nwent out to face the incredible mass\nof the opposition. Their size and\npower was telling, particularly in the\nforwards, but we fought well and,\nthanks to our superior speed and\nmobility, scored a marvellous try -Colone crashing over the line after\nbeating an incredible seven tackles.\nIn the second half against wind and\nrain the RCS passing want banana-shaped to say the least and the bag-gage-handlers took control.\nStout tackling against their heavier\nforwards prevented an even greater\nloss. Man of the match was Anthony\nSpicer. Spoon of the match was\nawarded to Darren Bryce.\nRCS 7 - 34 Heathrow BH Love lost, race won\nCertainly the muddiest course in the\nLondon Colleges league, Guildford\nprovided a tough race, especially for\nZola Budd who lost her shoe in the\nploughed fields. There was also disappointment for Yellow-Arse, whose\nsoap-opera love saga with his ex-girlfriend finally ended when she did\nnot even turn up to watch him run.\n[Bad luck there, Mr Arse - Sports Ed]\nHe was rubbish anyway.\nJennie, AGAIN, won the women's race with Dawn putting her best performance of the year. Gaffer, in his\nelement in the mud-wrestling conditions, was pleased with his run which\nwas stimulated by his weekend\ninnings of twenty-eight in Exeter.\nAfter blocking the showers with\nmud, IC cross country made a quick\ndash to the bar where we won the\npost-race drinking competition - hee\nhee! Unfortunately we had to depart\nearly to meet Poland!\nFive in a row for IC pot-heads\nAfter a run of four straight victories,\nImperial snooker team set off for\nNorwich to play UEA. The A team\nbegan slowly, trailing 6-1 early on\nbefore fine wins by Simon, Alex and\nPhil pulled the final score up to 10-10. The B team found going far easier, beating their opponents 12-4\nincluding wins by Steff and new\nboys Aki and Tony. The return\nmatch next week should provide\nsome equally exciting snooker.\nFirsts still got some Amo left\nAt last, a victory for the firsts! Last\nweek in BUSA \"we wu z robbed\" 5-4 on penalties due to a poor effort by\n\"Pretty boy\" Alex. We won today\ndespite the continuing absence of\n\"Goal Machine\" Ike, and having to\nfield mental patients Tony \"Don't worry, I 'll only break one leg\"\nHallett and Jules \"Oi, you want\nsome?\" Porpeca. With a ferocious\nwind behind us, we somehow only\nmanaged to be an Amo goal up at\nhalftime, with Jamie having a shot\ncome back off the post. In the second\nhalf we really took the piss, with\nAlex dancing around the keeper and\nAmo easily completing his hat-trick!\nOverall, it was way too easy, with\ngreat efforts throughout, except Jules\n'cos he's still shit.\nRESULTS\nMEN'S FOOTBALL IC I40 University College Hospital\nIC II 0 - 1 1 Leicester I IC II 4 - 0 Royal Holloway IV\nIC II 1-1 LSE III\nIC III 1 - 2 RS MII CIV32 Goldsmith's III ICI V24UE A I VRS M II 3 - 1 King's Hospital\nWOMEN'S HOCKEY IC I34 a et Sheffield Hallam I MEN'S HOCKEY ICI21 St Mary's IC II 0 - 1 0 Royal Free Hospital I MEN'S RUGBY RCS734 Heathrow Baggage Handlers\nSNOOKER IC A1010UE A A I CB124 UEA B SHOOTING IC 3943 - 3675 Cambridge\n\n"

Although, Charing Cross\nand Westminster Medical School\nmerges with the established ICSM in\nAugust of this year there will be no\nchange to student requirements at the\nCharing Cross site for the time being.\nRing fenced funding in the interim\nperiod is a perfectly logical solution\nto maintaining basic recreational\nfacilities for students off the IC cam-pus.

This year, I 'll have\ndone the same thing any self respecting young man should. Cheat. Count\nthe card from your mum. Use last\nyear's cards from that ex-girlfriend\nyou said that you would have no\nmore to do with. And those from the\nyear before. Tell everyone you got\ne valentines that morning. Walk\naround with a smug grin refusing to\nreveal how many you got. Claim the\nmost obscure newspaper Valentine's message as being a coded epistle of\nundying love directed solely at you,\neven if this means radically altering\nyour known life story to date. The\nworst thing you can do at this time is\nadmit defeat, and if this means sacrificing your personal dignity, so be it.\nSo, that's the morning's lectures\nout of the way, and the afternoon\ncan be survived by pretending to do\nwork. This leaves Valentine's night,\nwhich for some is more disturbing\nthan the morning. Those of you\nlucky enough to have some kind of\npre-organised tryst need not read on,\nbut for the rest of humanity, and\nthose of you who are lying, fear not,\nhelp is at hand. According to a random woman in the office, it is\nimperative not to spend a sad night\nin, cynically avoiding all mention of\nValentine's Day, and playing\nQuake/ watching slushy films/ getting skull fucked on cheap wine. No\nthe solution is to swallow your\nrapidly shrinking pride, put on your\nfinest party clobber and, that's right,\ngo to the Union, get drunk in the corner and watch everyone getting off\nwith each other. No, that's not\nright... If you plan, scheme and generally strain your virgin brow, you\ncan be one of the deliriously happy\nfew. Look around you, see the girl\nsplayed out on the floor by the vending machine. She's obviously off\nher face, sobbing heartbroken ly to\nher best mate about never finding\ntrue love and all that girl ie bollocks.\nSeize your moment, lose the friend,\n\"talk your meaningless profound\ncrap\" (said the same random office\nwench) and abuse your position as\nthe benevolent knight in shining\narmour. The deed is done, you will\nget your kicks and she will remember none of it and probably fall\nasleep halfway through.\nHappy Valentine's Day.\nCOMPETITION\nFor true style points though, it is you\nwho must do something romantic,\nand this is where Felix can help\nyou...\nThose lovely people at IRP\nPromotions sent us news of the first\never \"virtual careers fair\", which has\nbeen organised by Gradunet for the\n26th February.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 14TH FEBRUARY SPORT 15\nRobo knocks and crocks in hot-shot docs shock\nTHE LATEST SCORE\nFelix's regular \"external\" sports column by the ever talented and good-looking Dave Robinson.\nIt was third time lucky for England\ncricketers this week as they trounced\nthe Kiwi's, there is even the slight\npossibility we might win an overseas\nseries if things can be wrapped up\nChristchurch. Atherton seems to\nhave evaded the chop temporarily\nand will no doubt walk out for the\ntoss at Edgcbaston in June, watch out\nfor Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart\ntrying to get him run out. Hopefully\nwe can build on the last four performances to create a side with a hope of\ntaking The Ashes on this summer.\nSince the tests will be contested on\nhome soil, we won't be suffering\nfrom the usual bout of travel sick-ness.\nAs there was no Premiership or\nFive Nations last weekend, I was\nnearly reduced to a trip to Brighton\nfor the 'Fans United' match. Fans of\nevery club in the country inspired\nBrighton to put five past Hartlepool\nin front of the season's biggest crowd\nin the Third Division. Apparently\nthey had Palace and Mi 1\n1wall fans\nholding hands, and Newcastle,\nMiddlesborough and Sunderland\ncheering on the same team - amazing\nwhat Brighton can do for male bond-ing.\nThis week has already seen a few\nWorld Cup Qualifiers, Scotland came\nunstuck when the Estonians managed\nto turn up and with Mark Crossley\nde put ising for the immortal Neville\nSouthall, Wales managed to keep a clean sheet against the Irish. As you\nread this the result of England's World Cup Qualification game\nagainst Italy will be known, I 've\nalready had to read about and listen\nto people discussing a probable team\nover and over again. Judging by how\nwrong all my predictions were last!\nweek I'm not going to have much\nluck predicting a team or a score. I would however expect Hoddle to go\nfor Shearer and Ferdinand, which\nleaves the only decision of whether to\nplay McManaman or Merson. Both\nplayers have proved that they can be\nas effective as Alessandro del Piero\nand one will inevitably be disappoint\ned. I would imagine it will be a match\nwith goals as both sides contain many\nflair players willing to have a go, the\nextent to which this will be limited\nwill be decided by Maldini and\nHoddle.\nFor those who haven't been\nenlightened, if England have won\nand then go on to win the group they\nare assured an automatic place in the\nfinals. If however they finish second\nin the group to the Italians they will\nhave to play off against another sec\non d placed team from a different\ngroup at a neutral location for a place\nin the finals. I said 1 wouldn't predict\nbut I reckon it was 2-1 to England.\nResurgent fourths surge forth\nThe score line does not reflect story\nbehind this game, in which the\nfourths produced one of the most\ntremendous comebacks of the modern era to win three-two. This truly\nwas the greatest morale-boosting\nvictory this season, with a script that\nwould have pleased The Bard himself - at the end of act two we were\ndown to our lowest ebb and by the\nfinal curtain we were ecstatic.\nWith only four minutes remaining\nwe were two-nil down and seemingly set for their first league defeat\nsince early November, but then we\ndecided it was time to stop pissing\nabout and score a few goals. Firstly if\nwas Ryan who was found in space\nby an excellent cross-field ball, finishing with ease low into the corner.\nGoldsmith's then gave the ball away\nstraight from the kick-off and were\nover-run by a great wave of IC pre s sure. Within seconds a scramble on\nthe edge of the box led to Adam\nblasting home from close range.\nNow we were level but still we\nwanted more, and in the last minute\nwe forced a corner which was swung\ntowards the back post. Gloriously\nand majestically a Goldies' defender\nsoared above the rest of the defence\nand directed a perfect header past his\nkeeper. What a way to complete such\na comeback! Crazy scenes then\nensued with eleven mad footballers\nseemingly drunk on happiness all\ngroup-hugging and celebrating this\nsplendid fight back. A great end to a day which started\nwith the IC team causing a bomb\nalert at Victoria station, then stupidly\ngetting off the train at totally the\nwrong station, and then at another\nstation comically and pointlessly\nwalking around in a big circle around\na council estate looking for a bus\nwhich was actually directly outside\nthe station. Well done.\nIC IV 3 - 2 Goldsmith's III\nIC versus a constituent college - this\nwas a large one! Both teams needed\nall three points to keep promotion\nhopes alive; Ubogu, IC's early season signing was facing his old team\nfor the first time and for\nMary's... well, as much as anything,\nit was their cup final.\nThe game started at a ferocious\npace, Mary's making the early run-ning, their brash, bruising style\nunsettling IC at first and earning\nthem an early lead.\nThis spurred \"The Slags\" into\naction. Playing slightly deeper IC\nfound the space to pass the ball neatly about and carve holes in the\nMary's rear guard. Imperial had held\nthe upper hand for a rosy fifteen\nminute spell when Reed lofted a searching ball towards the fie sty Archbald. The defender made a good\ninterception but tenacious tackling\nfrom the twinkle-toed terrier forced\nthe error - the defender could only\nclear as far as Fleming just inside the\nMary's half. With the luxury of a little space he controlled the ball on his\nchest. It fell to the ground and\nbounced once. Seeing the Mary's keeper was off his line, he struck it\nfrom thirty-five yards. Immediately\nthe keeper was struggling and\ndespite his six foot two frame could-n't get a hand to it. The ball bounced\nOn a bad day for the IC football\nteams, RS M seconds reminded\neveryone that it is possible to win\nwith style and plenty of hi-jinx.\nRSM dominated the game from\nkick-off to the final whistle - the first\nhalf saw Martin drive home an eighteen yard shot leaving the deeper\nhelpless, Si quickly followed with an\nAn overcast February afternoon saw\nthe coming together of the masses of\nIC's bar staff. As the sides assembled\nthe numerical advantage was definitely with the Southers.\nUnperturbed by this (and the weight\nadvantage) the heroes of the Union\nwent to their task.\nAfter an unsteady beginning\nDimitri the traitor, who was moonlighting from his secret life in Basics,\nput on home for the union.\nSouthside's supporters, encouraged\nby whisky and vodka, then raised\ntheir team and Barney surged down\nthe wing and slipped one past the\nstranded union goalie. The union\nthen fought back and won a free-just before the goal-line and hit the\nroof of the net. 1-1 and a goal of the\nseason contender. IC came close\nagain through Reed with a blistering\nshot going narrowly wide after\nstrong run and a tidy one-two with\nSchroeder.\nOn thirty-six minutes the complexion of the game changed again.\nBig Vern made a timely challenges\non the marauding Mary's attackers\nand the ball became loose in mid-field. It was immediately contested\nbetween the Mary's centre half and\nthe galloping Ubogu. This Mary's man came off worse and the medics\nhad an assignment for the week as he\nwas stretcher ed off the pitch.\nThe delay, however, served\nMary's better than Imperial as it had\ncome in the middle of a purple patch\nfor \"The Slags,\" and they found it\ndifficult to get back in their stride.\nThe second half was a case of\nswashbuckling defending and in this\nrespect Finn and Shanidze excelled.\nTheir lunges, lurches, le ching, lingering and lovely linking looked\nlike...ace-brill, and with keeper\nKeane cool as a cat kicking cold cabbages we deserved to hold the fort.\nMalheuresement with ten minutes to\ngo Mary's grabbed a late winner and\nthe points.\nIC II 1 - 2 St Mary's almost as impressive goal.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY14 TH FEBRUARY Fair fares derailed by Underground privatisation\nALOK JHA\nSpeculation that London\nUnderground is to be privatised has\nintensified this week, following a report that it may be sold whole to a single company. This might lead to\nfare increases and scotch plans to\nintroduce cheaper fares for students.\nAn article in Monday's edition of\nThe Independent claims that the subterranean rail system could be sold\noff as a 'job lot', possibly as early as\nMarch, before the general election.\nLondon Underground has as yet\nmade no official announcement\nregarding privatisation plans,\nalthough a spokesperson claims that\nthe organisation has submitted a document to the Department of\nTransport outlining a number of\napproaches. The contents of the proposal remain confidential, and both\nsides have adopted a policy of\nsilence.\nLondon Underground operates\ntube services on behalf of London\nTransport, which has expressed its\nintention to remain neutral throughout the process. LT claims it wishes\nonly to ensure that whoever buys the\nnetwork maintains the correct safety\nand security measures.\nPrivatising the tube network,\naccording to the Government, is\nexpressly aimed at improving the service to customers (formerly pass en gers). However, projects that LT was\nhoping to carry out in the near future\nmust now be shelved until a satisfactory outcome to the sell-off has been\nachieved. One these postponed projects is the refurbishment of stations\nOn the way out... Public ownership\nchance for cheaper student fares.\nat the southern end of the Northern\nLine. Although new trains will soon\nbe introduced to the line, delays will\nremain as tracks and signalling will\nnot be upgraded. Hidden costs such\nas these will have to be met by the\nnetwork's new owner.\nShould privatisation be given the\ngreen light, the future of London\nTransport itself remains unclear. As\nthe sole administrator of the capital's public transport, LT is able to issue\ntickets and travelcards valid for both\nbuses and trains. As yet, there is no\nguarantee that a private investor\nwould continue this regime.\nSimilarly, were the network to be\ndivided up, it is unclear whether a ticket bought at a station owned by\none company would be valid for travel on lines owned by another.\nPHOTO: FRANK of the London Underground, and the\nAfter the privatisation, London\nTransport will not continue to control\nany transport services. The organisation might survive in an advisory or\nregulatory capacity, possibly acting a consultant for the tube's eventual\nowners.\nWhoever buys London's underground network will need to invest\nan estimated \u00a31.2 billion immediate-ly, to cover essential repairs and\nmaintenance. The burden of such an\ninvestment could be lightened if the\nGovernment pours money into the\nsystem before selling, as it has in\nsome previous privatisation s. Paul\nBates, University of London Union\nWelfare Officer, predicts that if a private buyer is forced to make a massive initial investment, the result may\nbe a sharp increase in fares and\nincreased hardship for students.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Bates\nexplained that he \"....cannot believe\nthat anyone would want to buy the\nunderground system. Shareholders\nwould not get a return on such an\nunder-invested scheme.\"\nBelieving that an increase in fares\nwould hit students particularly hard,\nULU has been exploring ways of\nobtaining discounts for its members.\nULU's President last year, Ghassan\nKarrian, attempted to negotiate a deal\nwith London Transport in which\nUniversity of London students would\nreceive a25% discount on tube fares.\nLT agreed to test the scheme and set\nup a pilot project for the students of\nQueen Mary's and Westfield\nCollege. According to Paul Bates,\nLondon Underground's imminent\nprivatisation has derailed the scheme.\nIt has been removed from UL U control and now faces an uncertain\nfuture.\nA student representative at Queen\nMary's and Westfield College\nexplained that the scheme had been\nvery popular with students, but that it\nwas \"...down to London Transport\nwhether or not it was successful.\"\nLondon Transport believes that the\nlong-term success of such a discount\nscheme could be guaranteed at the\ntime of privatisation, by including it\nas a contractual obligation to be ful-filed by the network's new owner or\nowners. Unfortunately, such a decision will be made during discussions\nbetween LT and the new buyer,\nwhere student interests are unlikely\nto be represented.\nAUT vote for\npay deal\nALOK J HA With a turnout of 64.9%, members\nof the Association of University\nTeachers voted with an overwhelming 92.3% majority to accept their\nlatest pay offer and end all industrial\naction. 99.2% of the union also\nvoted to set up a new pay review\nbody. These results, announced on\nWednesday, mean that pay will be\nincreased by 2.9% backdated to last\nApril and remain at that level in the\nnext financial year. Technical, manual and ancillary staff will also\nreceive a rise of 2.8%.\nAcording to Chris Moss, AUT representative at IC, the increase\nshowed that they had been particularly hard done by during the whole\nprocess.\nEverybody's fourth favourite ingredient\nPHOTO: ALDOUS Sainsbury's store on Cromwell Road. Where good food costs less?\nJACKIE S KEA TE Leading retail chain Sainsbury's has\nbeen ranked fourth out of five in a survey of food quality in leading\nsupermarket stores.\nFor Sainsbury's, whose flagship\nCromwell Road store is popular\namong Imperial College students,\nthis is further blow follows the\nannouncement that their profits\nwould be \u00a360 million lower than\nexpected, causing their share price to\nfall by 13%.

Page 2\nSecurity team get\nresult on bike thefts\nMATTHEW BENNETT\nImperial College Security officials\nare celebrating a massive reduction\nin campus bicycle thefts, following\nimproved security vigilance and the\narrest of a suspected thief before\nChristmas.\nA man was arrested on 11\nDecember after a fourth year Civil\nEngineering student noticed two\npeople, a man and a woman, making\n\"sawing movements\" near bicycles\nin Dalby court, behind the Civil\nEngineering buildings. He immediately notified Sherfield security\nreception. The couple were identified and intercepted as they passed\nthe Sherfield building as security\nofficers were going to Dalby court to\ninvestigate, but refused to be\ndetained. In the short struggle that\nfollowed, the man was apprehended\nwhile his female accomplice\nescaped. The police were called, and\nthe man subsequently arrested.\nAccording to the police, this man\nhas previous convictions for theft.\nSecurity officers on duty at the time\nof the incident report that the suspect\nwas carrying all the equipment necessary to steal a bike, including bolt\ncutters.\nUpon his arrest, the man allegedly protested that he was only \"mak-ing a metal sofa, and looking for\nscrap metal.\" Nevertheless, he has\nbeen charged with the offence of\n\"going equipped to steal\". The case\nwill come to court during the next\nfew weeks. If found guilty, the man\nwill be sentenced according to his\nprevious criminal record and individual circumstances. A man arrested\nfor attempted theft last year in Weeks\nhall was sentenced to four months\nimprisonment.\nPolice later obtained a search warrant for the man's house in North\nLondon and discovered he was living\nwith a girl matching the description\nof his accomplice. However, no evidence exists linking her to the in ci dent, and at present police have no\nplans to press charges.\nThis victory follows a number of\nimprovements to South Kensington\ncampus security measures. Foremost\namong these have been 'plain\nclothes' security patrols, which have\nbeen adopted as standard practice\nfollowing their introduction shortly\nbefore Christmas. This and other\nmeasures have seen a drop in bicycle\nthefts from around eight per week to\nvirtually none. No further bike thefts\nhave been recorded since the end of\nJanuary.\nSecurity staff routinely remove\nbicycles from certain locations if\nthey consider them to be causing an\nobstruction. IC security currently\nholds at least eight bikes removed\nfrom around the College which\nremain unclaimed by their owners.\nSecurity officials strongly recommend that students whose bikes are\nmissing check with Sherfield reception before assuming them stolen.\nWhilst highlighting their crackdown on bicycle theft, IC's security\nservice reiterated the difficulties\ninherent in maintaining vigilance\ngiven the size of the campus and the\nmultitude of places that bikes are\nsometimes left. The plain clothes\npatrols continue, and officials hope\nthat extra surveillance cameras will\nsoon be in place.\nIn Something for the\nWeekend: Fierce\nCreatures and Blur's new album\nreviewed\nPHOTO: ROBIN RILEY Doctor!

IC medical students share a joke over lunch in the Great\nHall before showing visiting sixth-former s around the rest of the campus.\nFirst ICSM open day\nattracts brightest pupils\nKENT YIP\nThe first open day for the new\nImperial College School of Medicine\non Tuesday attracted 600 prospective\nmedical students from some of the\nbest schools in the country.\nVisiting sixth-former s were welcomed by the ICSM's new Principal,\nProfessor Chris Edwards, in the\nGreat Hall. Prof Edwards immediately began by highlighting the potential\nof the new school, which will inherit\nthe research excellence of the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute\nand the Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool, and the proud tradition of\nthe two undergraduate medical\nschools at St Mary's and Charing\nCross Hospital.\nThis was followed by an overview\nof the new curriculum, which Dr\nRory Shaw, Rector of the Medical\nEducation Unit, claimed was \"Out\nwith the worst of the old, and in with\nthe best of the new\".\nDr Shaw allayed fears that\nprospective medical students might\nbe used as \"guinea pigs\" for a new\ncourse, explaining that the new qualification had been designed with considerable input from current students,\nwhose curriculum already incorporates part of the new course.\nDr Stan Head, Admissions Tutor,\nwent on to explain the selection pro-ce dure. Throughout his talk, he\nrepeatedly stressed the need for candidates to be good all-rounders in\norder to gain admission into the prestigious new medical school. Dr Head\nillustrated the highly competitive\nnature of the process using entry statistics from last year. Of 5,000 applicants to St Mary's and Charing\nCross, only 1 in 5 were called up for\ninterview, and only 1 in 12 received\nan offer. Immediately afterwards, Dr\ncontinued on page two\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY14 TH FEBRUARY NEWS 3\nDeaths were 'avoidable'\nMATTHEW BENNETT\nAn official report on last year's meningitis outbreak at Cardiff\nUniversity has suggested that the\ndeaths of two 19-year-old students\ncould have been avoided had mass\nvaccination been implemented, and\nhas suggested a review of national\nguidelines.\nLast year, seven students contracted meningitis between October and\nDecember. The first made a full\nrecovery. The second case occurred\nfour weeks and one day later, in the\nsame hall of residence. Since national guidelines state that cases four\nweeks apart are unconnected, the\ncase was treated as a separate in ci dent, and emergency vaccinations\nwere not administered. Only after\nseveral more occurrences of meningitis came to light were inoculations\nwere given to more than 1,000 stu-dents. Tests have since established\nthat all the cases in Cardiff were\ncaused by the same strain of meningitis bacterium, strongly indicating\nthat they were connected.\nOne senior health official stated\n\"My conscience is clear on this one.\nI don't believe any of the decisions\nmade by the outbreak control team\nwere wrong. I believe we made the\nright decisions at the time.\" He went\non to suggest that a rethink of the\nguidelines might be necessary, particularly regarding what is defined as\n\"close contact\". He also emphasised\nthat many people's understanding of\nthe development and spread of\nmeningitis is still primitive. It is\nbelieved that meningitis is contagious only through close contact,\nalthough none of the students affected were close friends.\nMeanwhile, Cardiff University\nstudents expressed concerns about\nthe lack of communication between\nthe University and the student population, and a lack of up to date information. The meningitis research foundation is funding various projects at St.\nMary's to investigate why the vast\nmajority of the population seem\nimmune to meningitis, while a few\nare susceptible and become seriously\nill when they come into contact with\nthe infection.\nThe staff of Imperial College's health centre stress that there have\nbeen no cases of meningitis at IC.\nSir Ron piles on the pounds\nNEWS TEAM For the second year running, universities have been required to make\npublic the salaries of their top staff.\nImperial College's Rector, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, recieved a pay rise\nof \u00a31,000 last year, making him the\nUK's45 th most highly-paid Vice\nChancellor and taking him up to an\nannual salary of \u00a3104,000. This is\ncomparable with other London institutions, but these salaries are not typical nationwide. The overwhelming\nmajority were between \u00a370,000 and\n\u00a390,000, with the lowest figures listed being between \u00a330,000 and\n\u00a340,000. Most vice-chancellors saw\nsignificant increases on the previous\nyear, although Strathclyde'sJ. Arbuthnott had a15% decrease from\n\u00a3120,000 to \u00a3102,110.\nThere were some marked differences between the salaries of institutions of similar reputations, most\nnotably with the vice-chancellors of\nOxford and Cambridge each earning\n\u00a378,895 and \u00a3109,000 respectively\nlast year.\nInstitution Vice-Chancellor 95/96 94/95 Position\nLondon Institute J.

    "content": "NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 14TH FEBRUARY FELIX FRIDAY 14TH FEBRUARY NEWS FEATURE 9\nIn Britain, our human rights are being eroded.\nThe Home Secretary interferes with the courts\nin a way that's not only unethical, but downright illegal. Our very freedom is in jeopardy\nas cynical vote-grabbing 'law and order' bills\noutlaw cultural choices; the Police State is a reality. We have no constitution\nYou may not agree with these statements,\nbut millions do, and these are hardly problems\nthat will be solved by writing to an MP or The\nTimes. When society's problems become systemic, only radical protest will get the message through. 10,000 placard-bearing activists\nand any liberty we have is enjoyed\nsolely at the failing benevolence of\nour rulers. Profit driven policy and party politics are leading to a gaping poverty gap and\nuntold environmental destruction.\nProtest Culture? Absolutely\ndemocratic method that is illegal and often\nviolent. Shouldn't people use our time-hon-our ed democratic system to express their\nviews? Perhaps we are over-tolerant of\nactivists who seem to wander around the\ncountry causing disruption for their own\nentertainment.\nmarching through the capital simply can't be\nignored or concealed.\nIs it right to protest? After all, civil action,\nparticularly direct action is a brute-force non-Bollocks. The law is broken\nbecause the law has failed. We\ndon't have a democracy, we have a stagnant,\ngnarly puppet-show that seems to resent its\ncitizens, not serve and protect them. DIY culture is here. If we want change, we need to act\n- independently, directly.\nIt is often forgotten by groups of protesters\nthat there are far more effective methods of\nregistering your distaste of a building project,\ncommercial activity or proposed law than\nlying in front of a bulldozer. These groups,\nfrustrated by their own inaction in opposing\ntheir chosen bugbear, resort to illegal actions in a last ditch, and usually futile, attempt to influence\nopinion. Unfortunately for them,\nand fortunately for the due and\ncorrect process of democracy and account-ability, they normally fail to succeed in their\nplans. The proper democratic channels are\nalways open for anyone to object, but it is blatantly obvious that these channels are deliberately ignored by the cadre of 'professional'\nprotesters who revel in the media attention\nand their fifteen minutes of fame. It is they\nwho put our society and its structures at risk\nProtest Culture?\nNot to be tolerated\nfor their own personal gratification. It is right\nthat these so-called 'legitimate' protests are\ndispersed by authorities acting under the auspices of the law. Right-thinking and law-abiding people, who are often put at some risk\nby protesters actions (witness the two deaths\nat last year's demonstration in opposition to\nthe export of calves), do not deserve to be\nexposed to this sort of mass law breaking.\nMore fundamentally though, two (or\nmore), wrongs do not make a right;\nthere should never be a situation\nwhere breaking the law of the land\nis a legitimate method of expressing\nan opinion. The more common\nforms of protest such as vandalism, libelling\nsomeone or an organisation and trespassing\non private land should recognised for what\nthey are: illegal.\nSurvey Results\nBypasses, live animal exports, strikes - all have one thing in com\nmon. Nearby you will find people of all ages and stages protesting\nand shouting out their views for all the media to see. Protesters have\nbeen in the public eye recently, with Brent Spar and Newbury\namong the most famous examples. The Criminal Justice and Public\nOrder Act outlawed; many forms of protest, creating the new\noffence of 'aggravated trespass' as well as outlawing some raves\nand certain demonstrations without permission. Should demonstrators break the law if that is the only way of changing it? Or should\nthe police clamp down on those who trespass and destroy property\nto publicise their own views? We have a conducted a small survey\namong students (questions below, results left), and have supplied\ntwo opposing viewpoints. Feel free to write and tell us your views.\nSurvey questions:\n1. Have you ever been involved in a protest?\n2. Do you think that peace full protest works?\n3. Do you think violent or illegal protest works?\n4. Is the right to protest an important part of a modern democracy?\n\n"
