J or s,W. A.W. REFECTORY SUPPER SI.C. Union,10 Jan.'52 Sir, We wish to be recorded as congratulating the Refectory Committee on the abolition of the Waitress Service in the evening. Such service is an intolerable waste of time, money and labour unless it is really efficient. Since we cannot, apparently afford to make it really efficient, it served only to increase the Refectory' s( and incidentally the customer's) economic difficulties and the Consumer's nervous indigestion. The present cafeteria system admittedly suffers from queues, noise and a slovenly atmosphere but these defects lie within our individual powers to mitigate. It seems to us the lesser of the two evils. Your s,B.F. G of ton, P.E.Li ley, J. W. Midgley, A,V.3. de Re uck. FELIX MAKEUP SirI have seen your notice in the Union Hall requesting\" any assistance\" with the sake up of FELIX on Sundays. I would like to help, but what ie the work, and would you expect me everytime? Your set c,,R. JS. Porter.( Oh Mr. Porter!S e would like six people every fortnight, and would not expect them to come each more than twice. The work comprises checking typed articles, stencilling headlines, and setting up pages for photographing. This keeps four people busy in each of three three hour shifts. Only half of each shift needs experience of the Job, and to spread the load on the Editorial Board( the alternative will be to cut down the number of Illustrations), we hope that six assistants will help each fortnight. Editor) In the beginning we are told was chaos, from which order arose by gradual evolutionary degrees. Natural History is not specific about the pr ella in ary state but dins into us its all. embracing tenet of evolution. The N.H.S. social began in nebulous chaos. It differed markedly ffB m. theory in remaining chaotic until a special act of creation on the night of the event produced from the limbo of ill rehearsed odd men tsa smooth running fantasia of mildly mike taking bio sophist r l.es. The traditional brains trust, wantonly fr ivo ling with ambiguous questions, gently bridged the sublimity of the day's lectures to the hoped for rid icu los it y of the evening entertainment. After nutritional activity in the upper dining hall the fulfilment of hope was heralded by a fanfare of glass tubing and filter funnel trumpets as the President, dignitaries and ceremonial tea urn of the Society processed in. All being settled, the newly formed Bio moni c Symphony Orchestra gave the first performance of a work specially commissioned for this occasion. This lyrical evocation of the joys of natural history, a theme and variations on the well known19 th century chorale\" all things Bright and Beautiful\", called for a variety of new instruments whose construction had taxed the ingenuity of the faculty' s research labs, for most of the previous fortnight, whilst its final Choral movement was eh an ced by a quintet, comprising the finer voices of the bio J.ogi. pai'_ st& ff \u2022\nIt j is the. great\" good fortune of the natural3e ien ce\"de part~ merit that professors and\" lecturers are glad at these socials to unbend completely for' the common weal. Without the pae on s of their nu in tet the choral symphony would have lost its deeper philosophic implications. With an all star ff cast in the pantomime\" Jack and the papilio na ceo us Legume\" they let t their hair down completely. What student could hope to parody them better than they parodied each other? XMAS PANTOMIME Yet another Mines' tradition' was successfully repeated Just before Christmas. Metallurgical students found some difficulty in trying to, as say' midst streamers, paper chains, silver tinsel and the other paraphernalia( normally associated with decorations) which' littered' the small as say laboratory in the Mines. Of course, as is usual, decorations were confined to the somewhat elite small laboratory. Friends and acquaintances from metallurgical brothers and mining cousins in the larger as say department were, however, invited into congratulate the final year met. students on their fine festive disp ls.y. Kind remarks were made about the hydrogen filled balloons which ware prevented from lifting the roof only by being tied securely to the benches; and about the coloured lights these latter remarks came chiefly from students still gamely attempting to complete their color i metric experiments. Eventually term was reluctantly concluded and students left for home - your observer noted, however, that care had been taken tote move the decorations( including the lights and balloons) and NOT leave them to posterity.

    "content": "ROWING On Saturday,15 th December,1951, on the top of the flood tide, the Thames R.C.\" Plum Pudding\" Eighth were rowed off. This is a handicap event, the slowest crews starT lng first and the fastest crew at the back, trying to overtax all the others in the2% miles from Putney to Chiswick Steps. Starting last but one out of Ik crews, the I. C.1st VIII improved as the race advanced and after Hammersmith Bridge rowed well and finished fifth. The only crew to pass them was Thames R.O. as scratch boat. The2 nd and3 rd VII I's also took part. Twelve members of the I.C. Ski Club, together with several camp followers, left Victoria on the22 nd December for a fortnight. in Austria. It was regrettable that the departure was so unceremonious, the party boarding the train as it moved off, but the general standard of physical fitness undoubtedly benefited from the much needed exercise. On arrival at St.Anton, the club was accomodate dina small, comfortable pension situated, much to the gratification of the local inhabitants, on the outskirts of the village. St.Anton possesses three ski lifts and the club instructor was the Ski Champion of Innsbruck University, so prospects were bright. At first, the snow cover proved deceptive and many would be skiers found themselves rock climbing. After Boxing Day, however, snow fell almost incessantly and skiing was no longer restricted to the nursery slopes. Tree climbing now became a popular sport at which the girls were particularly adept; they managed to drape themselves and their skis so, inextricably round the conifers that they invariably needed skilled assistance. Under the instructor's guidance the skiing technique of all improved rapidly and on the last days downhill and slalom race was held, the winner being R.6. Turtle, the Captain, C. Newman and miss B. Thomas were second and third respectively. In general the cost of good living turned out to be higher than was expected, out nonetheless, the evenings of the festive season were passed in a manner befitting anI.C. Club. k.a, a* SUPER CAPUT We are happy to be able to supplement the above official account with the report of our Special Correspondent: We were surprised at the remarkable enthusiasm for skiing displayed by members of I.C. Ski Club at St.Anton. Hot that the skiing was other than first class, but having seen the Club after a\" Tyrolean evening\", it was difficult to believe they would be able to stand on the morrow, let alone, ski. There were so,v many distractions. There was, for example, the unaccountable disappearance of abed and mattress, the search for which created such a rumpus as to lead to threats of police and evictions from the landlady. And there was the morning when the Hon. Sec. found himself locked in his bedroom and was forced to climb down two storeys, using only a balcony and three red boot laces. And there was the occasion when the Club assembled, mostly by chance, in couples in the same Stub ler, with however, one man over. It; was interesting, to a prejudiced observer, to watch the man oe uv ring for position and general va et~v ien that went on as each male strove not to be odd man out. We were surprised to find who finally lost the game.( And we are prepared to bet you were surprised, too, Clive'.) And there was the time... but perhaps not. In conclusion, it can now be revealed that the stampede down platform8 at Victoria, which began the trip, was due to the same person, who for days past had issued warnings that no mercy awaited the late^comer, who had the tickets, who was responsible for registering the skis, who... Who? Who is always responsible for everything that goes wrong in anI.C. Club? The Hon. Sec, of course! RUGBY The University of Delft XV arrived on the evening of Friday, J+ th January, and stayed as our guests for four days. They were fortunate in obtaining the services of K.v an We ale, the brilliant open side wing forward, but even his speed in defence and his elusive body swerve in attack failed to hold the determined effort of the IC XV. who won283 on Saturday. A visit to Twickenham in the afternoon enabled us to see the other big game on in London that day England versus the Springbok s. It was also oui te enjoyable. The defeat of the Delft students by a second I. C.X Von Monday, showed how judiciously the hosts had plied the guests with\" Scarsdale\" cider on the previous evening. The score was220. In the interests of fitness and strictest training jour correspondent lost his notebook on Monday night. On Wednesday,9 th January, I. C.had the honour of playing the first game in this country against the Siamese international touring side and, again thanks to some judicious c rocking by the club, members who went to train with the Siamese team during the preceding week, the College won2 I4.O. Ten writeups and six photographs in the daily press gave the club it so igg est publicity ever. In the evening the club entertained their guests to dinner in the Upper Dining Hall and in the presence of the Rector, the touring side presented I.G. with a pennant bearing the arms of the Thai Rugby Football Union. As typical of the rug ger world of the home countries the club in turn presented the guests with a beer stained I.C.c rest from the bar. Our best thanks are due toP. Burana siri of R.C.S. who made this great event possible. The three victories of the vacation bring the club's playing total for the year to19 games with only two lost and a points balance of22 U against US. _ _ _ _ _\nINTERNATIONAL HOCKEY On Monday7 th Jan.1952,a college' A' team enjoyed a very pleasant game with the visiting Delft Students. The result, a win for the Dutch team by three goals to two, was very close and perhaps a draw might have been a more satisfactory result. Hockey being the national game of Holland, the standard of the Delft Je am was generally very good, particularly their stick work. Throughout the game the pitch was in surprisingly good condition and the play was fast and open. I.C. opened the score v/ith a fine goal from J. Alderson on the rightwing and later D. Power went very near to scoring. S. A. Mossman on the left wing collected a through pass and scored with an acute angled flick. Delft retaliated and scored through their right winger A. Zi j lk er.In the second half, play was very even except for the constant menace of the Dutch centre forward P.H of x and who scored two further goals for Delft the last just as the final whistle went,. v, B+t|} de fen \u00b0 esP joyed very soundly, especially the Dutch centre half who proved to be ubiquitous in breaking up the I.C. attack. In the evening those who did not attend Covent Garden were taken on a conducted tour of London' s nightlife finishing for some far too late on Tuesday morning'. JUDO CLUB GRADING For some time past the\" senior\" members of the Club have regarded entering for grading merely as a rather expensive method of obtaining contest experience, and the grading held just before Christmas was no exception. Consequently, emotions varied between surprise and jubilation when it was learnt that, our illustrious, examiner had upgraded everybody. Congratulations to all concerned and especially to Mess rs. Millet t, Phillips, Wool d ridge, Young and Zelman, who all were awarded the rank of1 st Kyu, a grade that has only been achieved three times in the past history of the Club. Perhaps it would be as well to draw a tactful veil over the Annual Dinner which followed the grading, and an iron curtain over the\" celebration\" which followed the dinner..

    "content": "Viewpoint\nFELIX\nSTUDENT HABIT I imagine it will be generally agreed that most student share characters of sorts, are not Hiring a life of extravagant luxury, do have friends, and in a nebulous and unspecified way influence and are influenced by the world of women. Furthermore, these four abstracts, love, lack of money, character, and society might, without involving any violation of traditional thought, be expected to lend shape and form to the scholastic species. Why\nthen do students of Imperial College, when buying, horr owing or botching up clothes deliberately affect. all the taste and originality of a boiled potato, in order that the clothing trade may unload vast quantities of' city gent's natty suiting', as used by pawnbrokers, funeral merchants, and obsolete politicians. In case they are all pretending they are professors they should be told that poor as professors may think they are, when turned upside down and shaken, they generally yield more than a stub end and aMines Centenary coin. Surely our characters are not all dark blue and grey. Surely our female cohorts don't enjoy being lacerated by knife edge collars, or neatly slit open by a hard baked and tempered trouser crease with a blood gutter round the bottom. I four social life is so morbid that we must all try to be mistaken for someone else it is time we were warned or, in a few years time, we shall be furtively trying to be mistaken for ourselves. In fact the problem is already far more serious than at first sight it appears to be. In my opinion, and I believe it is shared, any group of students who\nconsider that the current conventions of society are binding and absolute, deserves to be excluded from society altogether. The reason being not only that this blind acceptance of things inhibits the specialised inventiveness which is the students greatest asset, but that it exerts a petrifying influence on the relationships of students with each other. Very few college men in immaculate suits and unexceptionable accoutrements are capable of walking round the quad, without that air of righteous boredom and clever sophistication which were the death rights of the last student generation but one. If you are in jeans, check shirts, lumber jackets, bright ties, peculiar shoes, weird coats, pink and blue socks, or bright yellow cords, and you walk into a roomful' of equally scintillating gentlemen nothing except their simultaneous exit will stop you from' talking to them and being talked at. But enter a union lounge full of pinstriped and herringbone d subjects ensconced in brown polished leather cavities, and you might as well pickup the nearest' Country Life' and read a jolly interesting article on Scotch Mist in the Orkney s, which is what you will do and what everyone else has done. And when you have finished you will decide that you might as well get back to Willesden junction and read a textbook which is what most of your pin boned and herring striped academic staff want you to do. Just in case some bright young thing writes a letter asking for the right coloured shirt to wear with blue cotton pants, I might as well say that I don't just want to change from one uniform to another. If everyone's goi xi g to wear jeans and drink' coke s',I'm getting back into my suit to drink methyl a ted spirit. All I want is a little relaxation around the place, and a few blinding revelations to the effect that it is not at this stage necessary to one's career to look like a civil servant. if there is any section of society which is justified in wearing whatever it likes, it is the student population, and in other countries and universities students make full use of this freedom. I know about the value of stable British institutions, but the facts are that brightly coloured shirts stay' clean longer, peculiar shoes last longer, jeans are virtually indestructible as they improve with patching, and a good suit is one of the most absurdly extravagant commodities on the market. The stability of a university is of no interest if it is sterile, and a hallmark of a virile university is the ability of its \u2022\nstudents to rise above the superficial conventions of its environment. If anybody finds me 1 shall probably be persecuted as an infidel, but perhaps, someday, someone will enter the lounge after dinner without a tie on and in an awful whisper start a conversation on aesthetics. My\nna x tyr dom will not be in vain.\" Caveman\", CHRISTMAS CLIMBING\n( with apologies to the others who went; Near the end of the old year several members of the Mountaineering Club journeyed to Wales by devious means, arriving physically, but not mentally, damped by the downpour which attended the5 mile walk from the nearest frequent bus route to Id walCott age Youth Hostel. On the first two day st ku ere was only snow on the tops, so the rocks were climb able, and most of our time was spent doing not too difficult problems on the lower cliffs on Try fan and the Gly der s. Soon the weather deteriorated, and snow came very much lower, so we applied ourselves to a few steep gully s. We found the most fierce looking we\ncould and set to work. on it. The gully did afford some shelter from the wind, which had been blowing a gale most of our stay, but as soon as we managed to hack our way to the top and look over the edge we were nearly swept over in a tempest of blowing snow. On Hew Year's Eve two hardy types left us to spend the night on Snowdon. Rockets were sent off from there at midnight but the people who sent them off only saw them start. Lastly the Car ned ds were conquered: our first try had been thwarted by cloud and wind; the second attempt was successful, though in thick cloud and blowing snow we could only see a few yards and our compass decided to stick. The summits were unrecognizable when covered in so much ice and anyway we\ncould only see what was a tour feet. The first summit we came to was surely U arne dd Daffy dd, but soon we came to another higher one that must be it but no, yet a third and higher one appeared under our feet: Carne ddL le we lyn was the same. We were very relieved to get off the tops, come to something we actually recognised and to know that we\nwould not spend there s to four days covered in ho a frost, looking like abominable snowmen wandering round icy wastes in wind and cloud.

New ones, Susan( Mary McKenzie), Jane( Barbara Harris) and the Lt. Comriiander ( David Allen) certainly survived the awkward choice of play.

Once upon a time there was a Beautiful Damsel who was imprisoned in a tower by a Wi c iced Magician. And the Wicked Magician set, to watch over her, aS phenix, which was a horrid monster, half Sphinx, half Phoenix. The monster carried the key to the tower on a chain round its neck, and challenged every Knight Errant who passed by to answer three riddles. If they were answered correctly, the Damsel should go free. If not, and of course, they never were, the S phenix ate the unfortunate mortal, bones and all. This went on for soma time until one day,when the S phenix was feeling very peck ish, not having had a Knight Arrant for wee ns,a student came riding by, mounted on a milk white bicycle. This student had lost his way, being deep in thought about his Finals examination, which was due on the following day. He was supposed to be going home early to do some last minutes wot ting, of which he stood in great need, what with this, and what with that. Consequently, he was somewhat annoyed when the S phenix put out apc law, or hybrid paw, and claw, and stopped him. The S phenix paid no attention to his annoyance, out rapidly explained the rules of the game to him, feeling hungrier every minute.\" And now\" it said,\" the first question is: what Is it that has neither cl, ws, talons, foot nor shoe, yet can plough as well as a yoke of oxen?\" The right answer to this was\" a tractor\", and it used to be a pretty good question till some interfering busybody went and invented the tractor. The student's mind, however, was on other things.\" An examination paper,\" he said firmly. The i phenix coughed, and scratched its head with apc law.\"( Veil, yes, I suppose so,\" it said doubtfully.\" Then what is it that becomes more opaque the more one looks at it?\" The answer to this was,\" a3es s arabian opal\", out the student perceived he was on a good thing and said,\"An examination paper.\" The S phenix lashed its tail with rage, and said,\" question number three is: what is the Ultimate mystery of the Universe/\" There was, of course, supposed to oe no answer to this( unless it be \" The St run cK\"), but the student was not deterred.\" Tomorrow's examination paper,\" he said. The S phenix gave an eldritch shrieK and expired immediately. The student removed the Key from around its necK, and unlocKed the tower door. The Beautiful Damsel, who had been listening behind the door, and was naturally all ago g,ran out and greeted him with enthusiasm, describing him, amongst other things, as her hero, Knight errant, and Prince Charming. The student's interest in examinations, never ve^y great, now diminished considerably, and leaping on to his milK white bicycle, he sl uni;t he Damsel across his saddle bow and pedalled furiously to his digs. Needless to say, he failed his finals the next day, and indeed, has not passed them yet.

    "content": "EVERY FORTNIGHT No.30 IMPERIAL COLLEGE18 JANUARY1952 f00D IMPROVEMENTS? REFECTORY COMMITTEE DECISION. At the last meeting of theR*e fec to rf^ Committee in December, the Catering Subcommittee, comprising Mess rs. D.N. de G.Allen, John Levy an a D.K. Nicholas was asked to look into the Costing, Buying and Staffing of the Refectory. Serious complaints had reached the Committee that the value of food used for suppers and evening functions was substantially less than half the cost of the meal, the generally accepted value. As a result, efforts were made during the last. few weeks of term to improve the food value of the suppers. It is understood that the Catering SubCommittee have reached some decisions with regard to evening functions which should be acceptable to all sides, and will be placed before the Refectory Committee in the near future. They are now considering the more general aspects of buying, staffing and costing of meals. In an effort to stem the present falling of finbar profits, the Committee agreed to consult Whitbread son methods of improving the quality of the beer. As a result, two beer pumps have been fitted in the bar, and an immediate improvement in the beer has been noticed this term, which together with the provision of a new dartboard and set of darts, once more makes the bara very pleasant nook in which to pass a spare half hour. They have also decided that the use of Ayrton Hall may be permitted in the case of certain more for malfunctions, but that drinks, of whatever kind, would only be served at dinner. Applications on similar forms to those used for Union functions, would be passed on to the Dean of City and Guilds. INTERNATIONAL SPORT During the first few days of term the I.C. Rug ger and Hockey Clubs acted as hosts to teams visiting this country from abroad. The first were both Rug ger and Hockey teams from Delft University on4 Jan. who were entertained until Tuesday8 th, during which time matches were squeezed in amongst other more social functions. The much publicised and probably the lightest team in the world, the Siamese international touring team, me tI.e. in the first match of their tour on Wednesday9 Jan. Accounts of these matches appear om page6. FELIX BACK NUMBERS AGAINA set of FELIX' are being collected for a Union Library set. The Editor would be glad to be offered a copy of6,14,25,29, for this colle c \u2022;\ntion. UNION COUNCIL\nThe Union Council has decided to setup a subcommittee to investigate the whole question of an Imperial College General Award. Opinion seems to be that a General Awards Committee will be formed which would award these\" Honours' to members of the Union[ for outstanding service, in all fields of social and( athletic activities for which Colours are not awarded. The insignia will probably bean additional marking on the pocket of the general blazer, such as a' surround of laurels. Council has also agreed to a temporary increase in the periodical allowance. In this attempt to. brighten up the Old Lounge, we may expect to see a I few more publications from our colonies over the Atlantic. Whilst on the subject of literature, the request from the Literary and Debating Society for permission to entertain an American debating team was dealt with. Further details of this visit appear below. U.L. U. DEBATE The U.L. U. Debate on' Mother and Child' attracted considerable interest both inside and outside the University. The interest inside the colleges was reflected in the attendance of over kOO and the extra mural interest by the reports carried by several national newspapers. The speakers presenting the Catholic case, with the feeling of the House obviously with them, gave the best of a rather poor collection of speeches from the platform. From the floor there were one or two well reasoned speeches but the Catholics were generally content with a repetition of the same points and their opponents with a swinging attack on the Roman Catholic Church in general instead of a localised attack within the terms of the motion. After three hours of debating the House divided and the motion welcoming the Al locution on Mother and Child was passed with a five to one majority. L.C. THE UNION SPEAKS ENGLISH On the31 st, January I.C. will be be sei ged by two American Students who are.' taking British Universities by storm in a concentrated' effort to reduce their debaters to in sign if i can ee. Both are members of the powerful and far reaching Phi Beta Kappa, and it is believed that their subtle plan for our annihilation is to make us accept the abolition of the English Channel. As the guests of the Engl is Speaking Union they are replying to a similar invasion made by our own representatives, and we shall have to muster all our defences if we are to survive. The Union is reputed to be considering a word rationing scheme, but will probably use up available stocks in doing so. Lookout England,' we're being got at'. POEM The other day beneath the boughs, I thought Is aw some purple cows, I looked again and saw a horde Of members of the FELIX board. The other day within the barI thought Is awan old For i car,I looked again and now I Know, That what Is aw was only' Bo'. "

WEAR NE F ELI CITATIONS OF THE SEASON Having made our resolutions and paid for all the parties, seen\" La Ronde\" and the latest An oui lh play, we wish the College a good New Year. This is the term of change from winter to summer, and from informal examinations to preparation for there althing to come. Whereas the Winter Term spent itself settling down to the imposed changes of a new Session, the Spring Term develops in its own right. As the days lengthen out, the ladies will realise that half the hop season is over; and that the boys will start to drink with moderation. This is a Leap Year.,,,: The post grads mayso6n be seen taking a look at the sun before scuttling back to their holes. Kensington Gardens will merit a visit by those interested in more than themselves, and the putting green and the Serpentine boats will be in use before this term is forgotten. It ma ices one young to be glad. Views expressed in the Leader Columns of FELIX do not necessarily represent those of College or Union official opinion. POSTGRADUATE LIFE The post grad' who can leave luncheon late to return to' his' laboratory at2.10 p.m., or who can come over to tea early, may well be envied by the timetabled undergraduate and possibly provide him with a target; in life by degrees. Threatened with examinations as facile measure of his progress, the Ug. has corresponding periodic bursts of work( we assume ourselves to have been average), during which other commitments receive the minimum necessary attention; but as these good resolutions are made, relief is found in thoughts of sparetime s coming under research conditions. The natural result of this should be the Union run by post grads, who can remain in lunchtime committees until past two o' clock, and who can spares j me time to run things in June as well as October. Yet this result does not occur. An extreme recent example was the composition of the Guild's Union Committee, which had no Pg. among thirty members until a General Meeting could elect them specially, and at that meeting only seven Pg' s were present. In. fact, such Ug. hopes are wrong. The Pg. is a privileged but busy man. Only a record of hard work can balance lack of success, and the familiarity needed with his subject is such that only the brilliant can avoid drowning in it. In defence of the high apathy rate among Pg' s we must point out that a. large number of them here come in from outside and are not familiar with the College, or even London; andI.e. graduates who continue straight on often have too many commitments when they start their second life here. If they had a fixed reckoning day, they might shake some of these off. Further, however, much of the' broader education' speeches of the beginning of the year they can remember; their supervisors, are concerned with the progress of work and the acquisitions of Masters' degrees. CULTURE The editors of some other college' papers were the guests a tour birthday party last term, and with them we discussed our various problems and ambitions. An interesting point arose in defence of the I.e. concentration of science, in comparison to colleges containing these and arts faculties. At these the' arts people' dominate their side of Union activities, e.g. the magazine, newspaper and musical, dramatic societies. The scientists get little chance to try. PROFILEJ OH N MiDGlEY\nFELIX \u00abi ot \u00ab\nJohn Winwood s sid g ley was Editor of FELIX from March to November of last year. In spite of this both he and the newspaper continued to thrive; and even when printing and paper costs became impossible John's ingenuity contrived the FELIX dance to redress FELIX' s balance and his own. John came to I.C. in1547 when a mere lad of22 years; achieved a B.Sc.( Physics). by d egress and then moved into' Chem Tech.' in(1950). Born wide awake in June(1925) he spent a youth marked only by a public thrashing in front of his( mixed) school for making eyes at the other half. This treatment made only a local impression on him, but had the. secondary effect of. be.6rt owing' on his eyes the considerable powers of discrimination which we recognise today. After leaving school John made no attempt to escape from the scene of his boyhood ordeal, but remained in his native city of Birmingham, joining anatomic energy project in1941; and in1947, John came\nto London.. The lad of Little Brom wi* h went straight Into the hostel Old Hostel, of course and on the lowest floors, in rooms since known as\" S nog ger's Rest\". This training, participation in the' First Floor Symphony Orchestra' and the inspiration of the mural\" Virginia\" which then adorned those walls, fit tg d him well for a place in the R.C.S. Lowry boat,1949 and1949; and in1948 they won'. We gather that as a human being this made him impossible, because next year(1950) we find him winning the Mole sey Junior Eights in a' Thames' boat. However, that year he was also in the slowest I.C.2 nd VIII, Soon after he fell out of the Old Hostel into the dustbins in the basement area, naturally gravitating at the end of. his hostel time(1950) to' The Cave', on Its evacuation by the previous Editor of FELIX. Tracing the history of his moustache, we\nunderstand that he found it, while on Vac. Work in Belgium(1948). He therefore tried touring France, N. Italy and Switzerland the next year(1949); but nothing violent happened again and so he gave travelling a rest until a return to France last summer(1951). The boy who wanted% ore start the' Muckrake'( we hasten to add,on decent lines) thus be.came\nChief Stapler to the first FELIX, and then,' in turn, Sports Editor, Production Manager, and' finally Editor. Lastly we would like to record wha j; we, his friends, base upon observation: Likes: Women, Smoking, Drinking. Dislikes: Women smoking and drinking. COMPETITION No.3.
