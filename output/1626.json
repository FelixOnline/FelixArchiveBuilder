The first team from Imperial,\nmade up of Ian Jubb, Jez Carter,\nJames McCouat, Tom Readshaw\n(captain), and Ann Babtie, had their\nconfidence smashed in the very first\nmatch of the tournament when\nthey were drawn against the mighty\nLeicester in the group stages.\nLeicester, now taking after their\nlocal football team, were a force to\nbe reckoned with as they took the\nwin from Imperial 3-2.\nMeanwhile, the second Imperial\nteam, made up of Kharthik\nChakravarthy, Sam Horne, Nick\nDunn (captain), Ujjval Jaipuria,\nand Uttara Raju, had their work\ncut out for them in a tough group\ncontaining LSE, Kings and Bristol.\nThey gave the other teams a good\nrun for their money but ultimately\ncame up short.The first team picked\nthemselves up, remembered their\ntraining, and went on to batter\neternal rivals UCL and Bristol 2nd\u2019s\nThe whole gang. Photo Credit: Imperial Squash\nIncredible performance from squash to nick title from favourites\nto secure their place in the quarterfinals against Leicester 2nds.\nAfter destroying Leicester\u2019s 2nd\nteam in an attempt to intimidate\ntheir 1st\ns (who were now blazing\ntowards the final from the other half\nof the draw) Imperial 1st\ns were set\nto take on Bristol in the semi-final.\nMeanwhile, Imperial 2nd\ns managed\nto beat Kings 2nd\ns 3-2 before finally\nsuccumbing to UCL 3-2 to finish in\na commendable 14th\nplace. Tensions\nwere high at semi-final time as\nImperial and Bristol were drawn at\n2-2.\nThe hopes of playing in the final\nfell on Ian Jubb to win the deciding\nmatch. With almost unnatural\ncomposure he secured the win and\nImperial\u2019s place in the final against\nthe big dogs, Leicester. Fuelled by\nrevenge (and the club\u2019s excellent\nSunday roast dinner), Imperial were\nready for the final. With fantastic\nperformances from all of the team,\nand victories in some extremely\ntight matches, Imperial overcame\nunlikely odds to reclaim their place\nas champions of the Roehampton\nsquash tournament.\nThe prize giving followed, with a\nmemorable and witty speech from\nteam captain turned comedian\nTom Readshaw being a particular\nhighlight. As reward for an\noutstanding performance each\nplayer received a Bohemian crystal\ntrophy, VIP tickets to Canary\nWharf squash classic and a year\u2019s\nsquash membership at Roehampton\nClub, valued at around \u00a3500.\nImperial\novercame\nunlikely\nodds to\nreclaim their\nplace as\nchampions\nI\nn our last home game of the\nregular season, the Immortals\nfaced the Kingston Cougars.\nAfter an amazing performance\nagainst the Lions last Sunday, the\nteam was confident coming into\nthe game. However, after a long and\nhard-fought game, the final score\nwas 12-20 to the Cougars.\nEarly on in the game, the\ndefensive team were moving\naround, causing a lot of havoc\non Kingston\u2019s offense. Multiple\npenalties were called, particularly\nfalse starts from the Cougar\u2019s\noffensive side. As a result, the line\nof scrimmage was continuously\nmoved up field, closer and closer to\nthe end zone. Finally, the defense\nwere able to force a punt, opening\nup the flood-gates for the offensive\nteam. With an extremely impressive\ndrive, Quarterback, Kevin Kimono,\nrushed into the end zone getting the\nfirst touchdown of the day (2-point\nconversion was unsuccessful). With\na tiring and injury-filled defense,\nmultiple offensive linemen filled in\non defense and held the Cougars\ninto the half with a score of 6-7.\nIn the second half, a frustrated\nCougars side adapted to our vocal\ndefense by introducing clap snaps\nin the hopes of reducing penalties\ngoing against them. This failed to\nstop Sam \u2018No Chill\u2019 Hill laying a\nfilthy sack on the quarterback and\nAlex \u2018heads down\u2019Brockhurst laying\nhim out in another play. Well done\nAlex!\nOn the other hand, running back\nPapa Noach Ben-Haim made\nsome very impressive runs gaining\na lot of yards, however, a fumble\nresulted in a turnover and ultimately\na touchdown by the Cougar\u2019s\nquarterback(kickwasgood),making\nthe score 6-14. The offense came\nback strong however, with multiple\nimpressive run plays and the famous\nrolling maul, ending the third\nquarter deep inside Cougar territory.\nAfter a few plays, Josemi Idigoras\ncompleted his first reception and\ntouchdown for the Immortals (two\npoint conversion was unsuccessful),\nhopefully with many more to come\nfor him! After a late touchdown\nfrom the Cougars, the game ended\nwith a score of 12-20, unfortunately\nmeaning that the Immortals are\nnow officially relegated from the\nPremiership league, however, this\nalso gives the team a chance to\nrebuild and come back strong. This\ngame\u2019s MVPs were: Sam Hill \u2013\nfor performing tremendously both\nways, laying down tackles left,\nright, and centre; Markus Mohr \u2013\nagain for performing very well both\nways; Harry Lawrence \u2013 covering\nwell, making essential plays to stop\npasses; Race Koidan \u2013 for being a\ngood laugh, a good lad, and an even\nmore impressive versatile player;\nand David Rovick \u2013 for playing in\na position he\u2019s never been in before\nand performing well.\nPANUKORN\nTALEONGPONG\nRelegation for the Immortals after Kingston loss\n\n"

Photo Credit: Sony Computer Entertainment\nIt\u2019s time to try defying gravity\nThe floor is lava. Photo Credit: Sony Computer Entertainment\nT\nhere are very few games\nthat have provided the\nsame joy and awe as\nSuper Mario Galaxy. I\nremember fondly the moment when\nI, as Mario, was able to run around\na small spherical planet for the first\ntime. I wasn\u2019t defying gravity; I was\nadhering to it, in a way no game had\never done before. It didn\u2019t allow the\nplayer to control gravity, instead it\nability that the player must use\nto navigate the environment and\ndefeat enemies. It\u2019s an idea that, if\nimplemented badly,could have been\nawful. Luckily, the developers have\nperfected the controls: hold down\na trigger to float and then use the\njoystick or gyroscope to aim where\nyou want to \u2018fall.\u2019\nThe expansive open world, unlike\nin Super Mario Galaxy, is flat (in\nthe sense that no part of the world\nis curved). There are times when\nlevels are formed in the same way as\nGalaxy \u2013 spherical and cylindrical \u2013\nbut,these are not what make Gravity\nRush so great. The incremental\ncityscape, from your beginnings in\nan undesirable part of town to the\ncity centre which adorns the cover,\ngives the player an increasing sense\nof wonderment. The initial thrill of\nfloating around, and walking on the\nside of, small buildings is eclipsed\nagain and again. By the time you\u2019re\nfinally towering above the city,\nthere\u2019s a real rush (pardon the pun).\nThe game isn\u2019t just a platformer;\nit incorporates many role-playing\nelements. You can upgrade your\npowers, do optional side quests, and\nunlock extra costumes. These don\u2019t\ndetract from the core gameplay\nin anyway, but they often feel like\nunnecessary extras. Personally, I\nwould have preferred a pure action-platformer. Super Mario Galaxy, like\nmany other Nintendo games, gets it\nright in the way that your character\u2019s\nabilities don\u2019t get better over time,\nbut expand through new power-ups\nand level mechanics.\nGravity Rush is very obviously a\ngame by Japanese developers for a\nJapanese audience. It\u2019s story begins\nwith the tired trope of amnesia. You\nplay as a girl called Kat, who meets\na cat, Dusty, with gravitational\npowers. You\u2019re thrown into a\nworld where gravitational storms\nand creatures known as Nevi are\nravaging the local populace. And it\u2019s\nyour job to save the day. At first, the\nplot does feel uninspired,but it soon\ngrows into one of fantastical intrigue\nwhich even manages to incorporate\nthemes of class and corruption.\nchanging environment, and districts\nof town, the sky changes colour\nas you move between each: the\norange of Auldnoir, the purple of\nPleajeune, the yellow of Endestria,\nand the iconic green of Vendecentre.\nEach reflects certain characteristics\nof these areas, making them feel\ndistinct.\nGravity Rush is the first game since\nSuper Mario Galaxy that has evoked\nthe same childish excitement inside\nme. I have a huge amount of respect\nfor developers Project Siren (and\nBluepoint Games who handled\nthe remaster). It might not be as\npolished or as revolutionary, but it\u2019s\njust as fun. There\u2019s something about\nplaying with gravity that is just\nawesome.\nGravity Rush Remastered is out\nnow on PS4\noffered up new environments where\nthe concept of up and down was\nconstantly in flux.\nFive years later, Project Siren\nreleased Gravity Rush for the\nPlaystation Vita. Critics at the\ntime noted its innovative controls\nand mechanics, but it never quite\nachieved the success it deserved\n(mostly as a result of being on a\nplatform that no one bought). At\nthe core of Gravity Rush is the\nability to manipulate gravity, an\nComic style cutscenes playfully add\ncharacter, and motive, to the world\u2019s\ninhabitants. If you enjoy the themes\nand styles often found in anime,this\nmight be the game for you.\nFor a game that has been ported\nfrom the Vita to the PS4, Gravity\nRush Remastered looks and performs\nmarvellously. It\u2019s a great remaster.\nWith the extra power of the PS4,\nthe gritty, almost steam-punk,\nenvironments are given the respect\nthey deserve. To exaggerate the\nI wasn\u2019t\ndefying\ngravity; I was\nadhering\nto it\nGravity Rush\nlooks\nand\nperforms\nmarvellously\nimperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on\nfriday 12 February\ncoming up!\nDate Event Time Location\nMonday 15 February Comedy Night 20:00 - onwards The Union Bar\nEveryTuesday Super Quiz 20:00 - 22:00 FiveSixEight\nEvery Tuesday Cocktail Night 18:00 - 23:00 Metric\nEvery Wednesday CSP Wednesday 19:00 - 01:00 Metric & FiveSixEight\nEvery Wednesday Sports Night 19:00 onwards Reynolds\nEvery Friday PGI Friday cocktails 16:30 onwards h-bar\nEvery Friday Reynolds Cocktail Club 17:30 - 00:00 Reynolds\nFriday 12 February Good Form 20:00 - 02:00 Metric & FiveSixEight\nFriday 19 February BPM 20:00 - 02:00 Metric & FiveSixEight\nFriday 26 February Common People 20:00 - 02:00 Metric & FiveSixEight\nStudent prices,\nstudent DJs\nhouse // bass //\ndnb // and more\nFriday 12 February\n20:00 - 02:00\nMetric and FiveSixEight\nFree before 20:00\n\u00a31.50 if you sign up to the Facebook\nevent (must be in by 22:30)\n\u00a32.00 with flyer\n\u00a32.50 on the door\n\n"

Photo Credit: Thekla Inc.\nJoel Auterson\nWriter\nThe Witness\nDon\u2019t understand a puzzle? Come back when you\u2019ve explored some more. Photo Credit: Thekla Inc.\nT\nhere have been very few\ngames released in recent\nyears that have had more\nto live up to than The\nWitness. Unlike the recent Fallout\n4, there was no multi-million dollar\nmarketing campaign, no tube ads,\nno merchandising \u2013 in other words,\nno \u2018hype\u2019. Instead, The Witness has\nbeen quietly on our radar for close\nto six years.\nBraid designer Jonathan Blow\u2019s\nsophomore effort was originally\nannounced \u2013 and demoed \u2013 in\n2010, having already been in\ndevelopment for a year. Blow has\nspent the last half-decade polishing,\ntweaking, and vastly overshooting\nthe planned 2013 release date \u2013\nas well as the original $800,000\nbudget. The finished game released\njust a couple of a weeks ago, with a\nfinal development cost of close to\n$6 million. I picked it up on PS4 a\ncouple of days after release, to see if\nit\u2019s been worth the wait. It has.\nThe Witness is,at its heart,a game\nabout mazes. Dotted around its\nidyllic island setting are some 650\npuzzles, in the form of mazes on\npanels. The player draws a line from\nthe start to end of the maze, and\nsolving a panel lights up the next\none. Solving some puzzles will open\ndoors, move platforms, or affect the\ngame\u2019s world in other ways. Taken\nat face value, this sounds pretty\ndull \u2013 how, then, have I sunk over\n20 hours into these mazes without\ngetting bored?\nThe reason is that Blow, as in\nBraid, has followed the Nintendo\nschool of game design: introduce a\nnew, simple concept to the player,\nand then explore all possible\npermutations of that concept. In\nThe Witness, different mazes will\nhave different rules, signified by\nmarkings on the maze itself. These\nrules are taught to the player without\nany words or explicit explanation \u2013\ninstead, a simple maze with a new\nrule has to be solved, followed by\na more complex one, and so on.\nThe island is split up into different\nareas \u2013 there\u2019s a swamp, a desert, a\nbeach, and more \u2013 and in each area\nthe puzzles have different rules.\nIt\u2019s when these rules start to be\ncombined with each other that the\ngame gets really tricky.\nThe Witness is not an easy game.\nQuite often I\u2019ve come up against a\npuzzles whose rules I simply don\u2019t\nknow,or ones whose rules I do know,\nbut haven\u2019t fully understood. This is\nintentional \u2013 in some cases, the only\nsolution is to walk away and come\nback later. There\u2019s a certain delight\nin realising that a rule you\u2019ve just\nlearned means you can now solve\na puzzle on the other side of the\nisland. Similarly, the feeling that\ncomes with solving a puzzle you\u2019ve\nbeen stuck on for ages is comparable\nto beating a boss in Dark Souls. It\u2019s\nyou against Jonathan Blow, and\noccasionally you come out on top,\nand feel like a king \u2013 then the next\npanel lights up.\nMany players will be tempted to\nlook up the solutions online, but I\u2019d\nadvise against this. It not only ruins\nthe fun,but in The Witness it makes\nlearning the rules more difficult,and\nyou\u2019ll need to look up solutions for\nthe next panel too; cheating will\nsnowball, and is best avoided.\nThe Witness is easily the best-looking game I\u2019ve played on the\nPS4, pinching that crown from\nthe excellent Grow Home. The\nisland looks gorgeous; the colours\nare vibrant, the water gloriously\nreflective, and the chunky-polygons\nart style is one of the best I\u2019ve\nseen. There\u2019s no music \u2013 the game\nis almost silent, the only sounds\nbeing the lapping of waves, the\nplayer\u2019s footsteps, or the low hum of\nthe maze panels. Anyone who has\nplayed the Myst series will feel right\nat home. The rare few melodies feel\nsignificant, and actually slightly\ncreepy \u2013 play with headphones if\nyou can.\nThe island is also absolutely\npacked with secrets and things for\nthe player to discover \u2013 the level of\nattention to detail is astounding. I\ndon\u2019t want to give too much away,\nbut as an example, there are some\npieces of what can only be described\nas artwork which are only visible\nfrom a certain perspective, and one\nkind of puzzle I wasn\u2019t even aware\nof, which, when discovered, totally\nblew me away. What plot that exists\nis largely left up to the player\u2019s own\ninterpretation, with various audio\nrecordings and sculptures scattered\naround the island.\nIn this way, the game is like an art\ngallery of sorts \u2013 what you get from\nit, other than the puzzles, depends\non what you bring with you.\nThe Witness is not a game I\u2019d\nnecessarily recommend to everyone\n\u2013 it can be punishingly difficult, and\nthe lack of a concrete story may turn\nsome away \u2013 but, for me and likely\nfor many others, it\u2019s a masterpiece,\nand I use that word without a hint\nof hyperbole.I can\u2019t wait to see what\nJonathan Blow does next.\nThe Witness is out now on\nPS4 and PC\nJonathan Blow delivers his second masterpiece, a game about mazes\nBlow, as in\nBraid, has\nfollowed the\nNintendo\nschool\nof game\ndesign\nThe Witness\nis easily the\nbest looking\ngame I\u2019ve\nplayed on\nPS4\nVisit our website to get more information.\nimperialcollegeunion.org/elections\nYou can stand...\nand we can help\nLearn about running in the election or\nbuild on the knowledge you already have.\nVisit our Leadership Elections website to\nfind out more about our information and\ntraining sessions.\n\n"

Photo Credit: Daisuki\nA world of heroes. Photo Credit: Daisuki\nReserved Regality. Photo Credit: BBC\nTwo lost puppies in the wild. Photo Credit: BBC\nSaad Ahmed\nTelevision Editor\nW\nhen it was\nannounced that\nthe BBC would be\nproducing another\nadaptation of Tolstoy\u2019s epic tome,\nI, like many others, was intrigued.\nThen came the news that veteran\nshowrunner Andrew Davies, who\nhas written or produced for the likes\nof everything from Bridget Jones to\nPride and Prejudice, would be the\nguiding hand. This split people into\nmainly two camps; those who, like\nme, were reassured, and others who\nfelt this was an affront to Tolstoy\u2019s\nspirit. These purists believed that\nDavies would use this as nothing\nbut an excuse to give us a sexed-up traipse through the 19th\ncentury\nglitterati. They weren\u2019t entirely\nwrong. But, in his defence, the show\nrunner only does this by showing us\ndirectly some of the subtext of the\nnovel; subtext that Tolstoy did not\nelucidate himself only because the\nsocial trappings of his era did not\nlet him.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with this\nbehemoth of fiction, War and\nPeace follows five families from the\naristocracy of 19th\ncentury Russia.\nWe follow the lives and struggles of\nthese people on the eve of Russia\u2019s\nwar with Napoleon and through the\nfollowing years.\nAnother area of concern,one more\njustified, was the compact length\nof the adaptation. Six episodes is\ndangerously thin space to cover the\nmonolithic text.As such,the success\nof this adaptation depended greatly\non the calibre of the actors within\nit, and their capability to impart\nTolstoy\u2019s complexities to us through\ntheir emotion. I\u2019m pleased to say\nthat, in this regard, the production\nsucceeds admirably.\nWhoever did the casting deserves\na bonus. Paul Dano is pitch-perfect\nas the hapless Pierre Bezhukhov,\ndoing that typical Paul Dano\nthing of looking and acting like a\nlost puppy. Lily James also shines\nhere, surprising with her range\nand evocativeness as the innocent\nNatasha Rostova. I liked her just\nfine in Downton, but she really\ndidn\u2019t get this kind of opportunity\nto flex her acting muscles there.This\nperformance has got me hyped for\nPride and Prejudice and Zombies.\nThe real revelation,however,is Jessie\nBuckley as the ever beleaguered\nMarya Bolkonkaya. She manages to\nconvey immaculately the character\u2019s\ntight-rope walk between reserved\nstrength and deep sadness. If there\u2019s\nany weak link here it\u2019s Jack Lowden\nas Nikolai Rostov. It\u2019s not so much\nthat the acting is bad, but rather\nthat the character is just played, or\npossibly written, incorrectly. Instead\nof being fraught by his divided\nloyalties, Nikolai just comes across\nas a fickle asshole with no real\nregard for anyone else.\nThe previously mentioned\nshort length does create some\npacing issues, however. The series\npractically ignores Helene towards\nthe end, although the few scenes in\nwhich she features are poignantly\nperformed. Additionally, there are\na few moments here and there that\ndon\u2019t quite have the impact they\nshould because we just haven\u2019t spent\nas much time with the characters\nas would have been appropriate.\nPerhaps the worst case of this is\nPetya Rostov\u2019s death where, to be\ncompletely honest, I barely gave a\nshit.\nThe first half of the series, at first\nglance, seems to be more focused\non the romance and court intrigue\naspects of the plot. This isn\u2019t\nnecessarily a criticism per se, as it is\na good way to pull in more casual\naudiences, and eases the viewer\ninto the story without immediately\nbombarding them with Tolstoy\u2019s\nheavy philosophising. Additionally,\nthe reasoning for this structure\nbecomes beautifully apparent in one\nmoment in episode 5, with Andrei\nBolkonsky\u2019s and Anatole Kuragin\u2019s\nmeeting on the battlefield. It serves\nto make us experience the full force\nof Andrei\u2019s realisation by making\nus undergo it at the same time. Just\nas he realises how trivial the small\ntransgressions and struggles of egos\nback home are in the face of the\ngreat human tragedy of war, so too\ndoes the audience.\nI also have some final stray\nobservations on the series. Firstly, I\nlove the use of lighting in this series.\nIn particular, for Natasha and its\nrelation to her development. Also,\nthe memorial montage for Andrei,\nand its format are downright absurd.\nIt feels like someone accidentally\ncut in a wedding video from the\n80s and actually caused me to laugh\nwhen I first watched it.\nSome of the self-proclaimed\nguardians of high literature may take\nissue with Davies\u2019 initial approach\nto the series. Thing is, at the end of\nthe day, War & Peace is a love story.\nOkay, that\u2019s a little disingenuous.\nRather, it\u2019s about the great cruelty\nof the world and the secret, fragile,\nyet immensely powerful weapons\nagainst it; love and compassion.\nEveryone behind this adaptation\nclearly seems to understand this,\ncertainly better than its detractors.\nUltimately, I think Tolstoy himself\nwould be quite pleased with this\ndistillation of his tonic against\ndoom & gloom, and all it tries to\naccomplish.\nWar and Peace is on iPlayer\nWe follow\nthe lives and\nstruggles of\nthese people\non the eve of\nRussia\u2019s war\nwith Napoleon\nTolstoy\nhimself would\nbe quite\npleased with\nthis distillation\nof his tonic\nagainst doom\nT\nhis anime is one which\nis a stark departure from\nhow typical anime, or\nindeed superhero stories,\nusually are and that is a completely\ngood thing. The biggest quality of\nthis show is that it feels fresh and\nnew. It was originally a webcomic\nwhich was so popular it got its own\nanimated adaption, and it is not\nhard to see why. The show features\nSaitama, our protagonist, who is so\nstrong he can defeat all his enemies\nwith, as the title suggests, one\npunch. What follows are episodes\nfilled with intense action,outlandish\nhilarity, and just some plain, crazy\nfun.\nThe standard trope we see or\nexperience is usually that of a chosen\nor gifted hero, who must learn all\nthe skills necessary to defeat the\nvillain.This show flips that trope on\nits head in an awesome parody kind\nof way. Our hero is so strong that\nall his battles end with one punch,\nand because of this, he is literally\nbored and just wants to find a\nworthy opponent (along with some\nfans). The reason he got that way?\nHe trained on his own so hard he\nwent bald (I\u2019m not making this up).\nDespite all his immense power, the\nbest you can describe his personality\nas is stoic, humble and a little\nunremarkable.\nThe mostly standalone episodes\nfeature our hero meeting, and\ndefeating, different villains and\nmonsters as well as meeting other\nheroes along the way. Everyone\nreacts in differing and amusing ways\nwhen seeing Saitama\u2019s attitude as\nwell as his strength. There is also a\nsimple ongoing plot thread about\nSaitama trying to become a more\nprofessional hero and wanting\nto be treated with more respect\nfrom everyone else. The succession\nof battles all pile up, ultimately\nculminating in the final showdown\ntowards the last few episodes.\nThe plot, although simple and\nminimalist, has made this anime\none of the best to ever hit the world.\nOne Punch Man has shown that\nyou do not need an over-the-top\nprotagonist, someone hell bent on\ntaking over the world or a grand\nadventure to be entertaining.\nThis show doesn\u2019t try to be funny\nyet it is a large bundle of laughs.\nA lot of hilarity comes from\nseeing the villains and monsters\n(and sometimes heroes) scoff at\nSaitama\u2019s appearance and brag\nabout their own strength, only to\nbe promptly dealt with in one hit.\nIt also helps that Saitama almost\nalways has a bored expression and\nis completely non-plussed about\nanything happening around him\nand everyone he confronts. For\nexample, in one awesome encounter,\na monster states he\u2019s going to go on\na rampage for one week, all the way\nto Saturday, and Saitama is shocked\nbecause it means he missed the\nSaturday supermarket sale, leading\nhim to punch out the monster\u2019s guts\nin frustration.\nObviously just seeing countless\nmonsters get defeated would get old\nrather quickly, so to add something\ndifferent, other heroes show up as\nthe show progresses with some of\nthem having recurring or supporting\nroles. A plot point is that all the\nheroes are divided into different\nranks, set by the Hero Association,\nand their power set and attitudes\nusually reflects their status. It\u2019s\nrefreshing to see new players enter\nthe playing field and see what they\nbring to the table. They approach\nproblems and other characters in\nunique ways and it\u2019s entertaining to\nsee the interplay between them.\nOne of the problems of the show,\nhowever, is that some of these\nheroes aren\u2019t developed enough and\ncome off as one dimensional. In\nparticular, the S-rank hero Tornado\nsuffers the most as she comes off as\na bratty girl with a lot of power and\nan unlikable personality. The same\nproblem could be extended to the\nvillains and monsters, but as they\nare usually taken out in the episode\nthey appear in, it\u2019s not so much\nan issue with them. Honestly, this\nis a relatively small issue and I\u2019m\nbasically nitpicking here.\nThe animation quality of the\nshow is top-notch. All the monsters\nare animated with great detail and\neach episode is a visual delight. The\nfight scenes are also all wonderfully\nrendered; you can see and feel every\nimpact and force behind all the\npunches and attacks. There are also\nsubtle touches in the animation\nwhich are much appreciated. For\nexample, seeing Saitama\u2019s eyes\nchanging expression depending on\nthe intensity of the situation as well\nas the monsters\u2019 faces going from\ndeadly and full of rage to glassy eyed\nand dead.\nOne Punch Man deserves\nall the popularity and praise\nit has considering what it has\naccomplished. It might not be a\ngreat battle series with an original\nstory but it is an excellent parody\nand action series. This anime is\nentertaining,unique and definitely a\nfun watch and with only 12 episodes\nout so far, there is little reason for\nyou not to watch. It is with eager\nanticipation, that we all wait for\nseason two.\nOne Punch Man is available on\nDaisuki and Hulu\nOur hero is\nso strong that\nall his battles\nend with one\npunch\nThe fight\nscenes\nare also all\nwonderfully\nrendered;\nyou can see\nand feel every\nimpact\n\n"

But of course, for those\ninvolved, for their family and\nfriends, for the whole industry,\nthat was far from it; director Jay\nRoach seeks to rectify this in his\nfilm Trumbo \u2013 focusing on a single\nindividual (in this case Dalton\nTrumbo, the screenwriter of Roman\nHoliday, Exodus, and Spartacus),\nthe film invites us to observe the\ncatastrophic effects the blacklist had\non an entire generation of creatives.\nBryan Cranston is the titular\nTrumbo, and while \u2013 fresh from his\nstratospheric success in Breaking\nBad \u2013 he provides the film with\na certain amount of gravitas, his\ncharacter really seems to amount\nto little more than a collection of\nmannerisms. Cranston\u2019s Trumbo\nclutches his trademark cigarette\nholder, spends hours in the bath\nscribbling, and responds to every\nchange in situation with the same\npained/confused face; he delivers\nhis lines in a tone that reminds me\nmost of Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019oil baron\nin There Will Be Blood \u2013 strained,\ndignified, charismatic.\nThe overall effect is that everything\nCranston says seems to take on an\nair of gravitas, making his Trumbo\nseem less like a human being and\nmore like rhetoric given a human\nform. It is perhaps unsurprising that\nCranston\u2019s performance is so broad,\ngiven Roach\u2019s most famous work is\nthe Austin Powers trilogy. At one\npoint, his friend and fellow writer\nArlen Hird (a composite character,\nplayed very well by Louis C.K.)\nsnaps at him: \u2018Jesus, do you ever\nsay anything that isn\u2019t gonna get\nchiseled on a rock?\u2019\u2013 a fair question.\nBut then perhaps the fault\nlies \u2013 ironically enough \u2013 with\nscreenwriter John McNamara. The\nscript is solid,but not anything really\nspecial. It hits all the points along\nthe story arc, giving us the requisite\ninitial setbacks, betrayal from a\nfriend, an emotional crisis (where\nTrumbo\u2019s guilt seems to be absolved\nby him spending his cash), and an\neventual, inevitable conclusion. Cue\ncredits and archival footage.\nCranston has a fair amount of\nbackup power in the supporting\ncast: Diane Lane delivers the most\nnuanced performance of the film\nas Trumbo\u2019s long-suffering wife;\nElle Fanning puts in a great turn\nas Trumbo\u2019s fiery teenage daughter,\nwho is more concerned with the\npassing of the Voting Rights Act\nthan her father\u2019s scriptwriting;\nand Michael Stuhlbarg does an\nadequate impression of actor\nHelen Mirren in full-on mad hat mode, opposite the strained Bryan Cranston in Trumbo. Photo Credit: YouTube/Entertainment One\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nCranston\u2019s\nTrumbo\nreally\namounts to\nlittle more\nthan a\ncollection of\nmannerisms\nPerfunctory historical piece without pizzazz\nTurgid Trumbo fails to shine, despite the best efforts of Bryan Cranston\nEdward G. Robinson (although,\nafter his exceptional performance\nin A Serious Man, all I really want\nis for Stuhlbarg to get more film\ntime in any role). Helen Mirren,\nplaced front and center in all the\nadvertising campaigns for the film,\nhas little more than a bit role in\ngossip-columnist Hedda Hopper;\nit\u2019s all mad hats, panto-dame style\nbarbs, and rampant anti-semitism,\nand \u2013 ultimately \u2013 she really isn\u2019t\nthat good.\nThe film is stolen, however, by\nJohn Goodman, who puts in a\nbarnstorming performance as Frank\nKing,a B-list producer who takes on\nscripts written by Trumbo in secret;\nGoodman has some of the best\nscenes of the film, and runs with\nthem, culminating in one where\nhe is threatened with shutdown\nif he doesn\u2019t fire Trumbo. \u2018I make\ngarbage!\u2019 he screams, smashing a\nbaseball bat into the space that\nseconds before was filled with a\nman\u2019s head; \u2018wanna call me a pinko\nin the papers? Do it! Nobody who\ngoes to my movies can fucking read.\u2019\nBut it turns out Goodman\u2019s\nperformance is the high spot of\nan otherwise flaccid piece of work.\nWhile overall the cast put in a\nsolid (if uneven) effort into their\nroles, there is a sense in which the\nfilm doesn\u2019t really come together.\nPerhaps it\u2019s the script, which flies\nthrough 15 years of tumultuous\nhistory at a speed which would\ngive you whiplash; or maybe\nit\u2019s the direction, which is done\nperfunctorily and without panache;\nor perhaps it\u2019s the cinematography,\nand the bizarre lighting style\nwhich sees everyone brightly\nilluminated from the front. In some\nrespects, this film reminded me of\nSpielberg\u2019s Bridge of Spies, another\nfilm about one man facing down\nrabid, commie-fearing America; but\nthat film was produced with oodles\nof style, making it a masterful\noil painting in comparison with\nTrumbo\u2019s colour-by-number.\nA\nbeautifully shot movie,\nenhanced by the location\nof a secluded valley in\nIceland, Rams is a story\nabout family \u2013 which here includes\nsheep.\nThe story revolves around two\nestranged brothers Gudmundur\n(Gummi) and Kristinn (Kiddi)\nBodvarsson, who have not spoken\na word to each other for 40 years.\nAll their correspondences are\nconveyed through a messenger\nsheep-dog; it helps that they are,\nin fact, neighbours. After narrowly\nlosing to his brother at the yearly\nram competition, fueled by jealousy,\nGummi becomes convinced his\nbrother\u2019s sheep is infected with\nscrapie, a degenerative disease\naffecting goats and sheep. After\nhis thoughts are confirmed, the\nimplications sink in: a death\nsentence for all the valley\u2019s sheep,\nincluding his own. Slaughtering\ntheir ancestral prize winning flock\nand allowing the Bostatur breed\nto become extinct is not on either\nbrother\u2019s agenda, and they go about\ntrying fight the inevitable in their\nown way.\nWinner of the Un Certain\nRegard Prize at Cannes in 2015,\nRams was Iceland\u2019s entry for the\n2016 Oscars for the Best Foreign\nFilm category. Shot in a secluded\nIcelandic valley, the film has no\nshortages of scenic vistas.The use of\nlong still shots frames the isolation\nRams\nDir: Gr\u00edmur H\u00e1konarson.

A haunting\nscore by Atli \u00d6rvarsson perfectly\ncomplements these shots to create\na sense of extreme loneliness. The\nrelationship between the men and\ntheir flock is shown to be one of\nfamily \u2013 if not more than family \u2013 as\nit is only at the possibility of losing\ntheir sheep that the brothers even\ndecide to communicate. As the film\nprogresses, we see the relationship\nbetween the two brothers change\nand evolve, as they are faced with\na common goal of securing their\nancestral flock.\nWith strong and subdued\nperformances from both the leads\nSigur\u00f0ur Sigurj\u00f3nsson (who was\nin the music video for \u2018Crystals\u2019 by\nIcelandic band Of Monsters and\nMen) and The\u00f3d\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edusson, you\nfeel as attached to the sheep as the\nbrothers, especially in the lead up to\nthe final shot. As they movie ends\nL\negally Blonde is a decent\nenough film, and I\nappreciate the effort of\nthe filmmakers to create\na stereotype-defying and intelligent\nfemale lead. However, the fact\nremains that Woods only gets into\nlaw school because the admissions\nofficer fancies her, and her big\nshow of intelligence at the end of\nthe film has nothing to do with\nany knowledge of complex law.

Talking about why\nhe wanted to make Easy Rider, he\ntalks about turning a mirror on the\n\u2018society of criminals\u2019 that make up\nthe powerful of America; however,\nfor each interesting aphorism\noffered by Hopper there are two\nmore that grate, such as his take on\nliteracy: \u2018I don\u2019t believe in reading.\u2019\nWatching this 1971 piece back\nnow, it is perhaps unfair to judge\nHopper in the cold light of modern\nstandards.

He would not\ndirect again for another ten years.\nThe American Dreamer is somewhat\nsimilar, making use of sharp jump\ncuts and experimental interludes\nin a way unassociated with most\ndocumentary features. The result is\na beguiling, engrossing work that,\nalthough showing Hopper in an\nunflattering light, seems completely\nhonest about the director\u2019s inner\nlife.\nFRED FYLES\nThe American Dreamer will be\navailable from online screening\nplatform MUBI from 12th\nFebruary\nDennis Hopper, the last true American dreamer, here showing off his gun colelction.

But I shall try and be\nobjective.\nBattlefield is essentially a retelling\nThe Young Vic presents an inspiring but shallow take on a Hindu classic\ncomparable to the Bible, Qur\u2019an,\nor the works of Shakespeare and\nHomer.\nLet me get it out of the way:\nBattlefield is a great production. The\nYoung Vic itself is a remarkable\nvenue, \u201cbustling and unorthodox\u201d\nand \u201cSouth London\u2019s glorious\ntemple of leftfield theatre\u201d. It ticks\nall the boxes \u2013 fancy bar (nutritious\nspring water on tap), a simple,\nminimalistic black box layout.\nIt\u2019s is worth a visit; few places are\nas brimming with energy. Their\nproductions are top-notch,and great\ncredit has to be given to whoever it\nis who oils the cogs and wheels in\nthis machine. Seats are worth their\nprice, things start and end on time,\nand there are no backstage brawls\nbetween stage-hands and makeup\nartists.\nSecondly, Battlefield is superbly\nacted. McNeill makes a great,\nrelatable everyman of the demigod-like protagonist, Yudishtira.\nKaremera was great as the female\nlead,Yudishtira\u2019s mother,an absolute\nparagon of all that is motherly and\nmatronly, equal parts nurturing\nand authoritative. I cannot leave\nout her poise, her grace, and how\nsuperlatively she conveys a sense\nof quiet fortitude with her sheer\nbody language. O\u2019Callaghan is the\nreal stand out though; his primary\nrole as the blind king, the father of\na hundred dead men, is deliciously\nrealised with almost Grecian pathos.\nFinally, Nzaramba plays Krishna,\none of the most revered characters\nin the mythology, whose very\nessence is his virtuosity, authority\nand godlike status. Nzaramba is a\nvery,very good actor \u2013 with a superb\ncommand of expression, intonation,\nand subtle inflections that he\nuses to his advantage to create an\nentertaining performance. But as to\nhow far he embodies the properties\nof his character, I am not sure.\nWell, this is the entire cast \u2013 sparse,\nnuclear, four-person. And at the\nhelm of it is Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Estienne\nand the legendary Peter Brook\nhimself (whose first production of\nthe play ran for a bladder-boggling\nnine hours).\nHowever, I was less than\nimpressed with Battlefield. I\u2019d\ndefinitely say that it falls short of its\nlofty ambitions, or even cast doubts\non the loftiness of those ambitions.\nThe biggest disappointment was the\nwriting \u2013 how much more this play\ncould be! The script barely addressed\nthe central plot or, indeed, the most\npervasive theme in the source\nmaterial \u2013 namely, war. It was as\nthough one had adapted Sun Tzu\u2019s\nThe Art of War and focused entirely\non terrain analysis and taxation.\nIt\u2019s not that I demand blood and\nviolence on stage. It\u2019s that one of\nthe central efforts of the source text\nis a meditation on conflict and the\nmoral philosophy of justice, killing,\nand warfare. And instead of this, we\nare treated to a bunch of fables about\nsnakes, pigeons, falcons, worms,\nand mongooses. One gets the\nfeeling that the makers of this play\nabandoned the deeper points made\nby the work to focus on throwing\ntogether a bunch of colourful, exotic\nparables that would conjure up the\npeculiar allure of the \u2018mysterious\nEast\u2019. What of the interesting\ncharacter dynamics, the incredibly\npotent plot, the ruminations on\nduty, responsibility, and ethics?\nInstead, we get a funny story about\na worm that doesn\u2019t want to die. It\nis as though a Homerian plot were\ncondensed into a series of Aesop\u2019s\nfables.\nIn this way I felt as though\nthe source material was terribly\nunderused. As W.J. Johnson says,\nthis is a text with equivalent literary\nvalue and emotive force as the\nGreek tragedies,or of Shakespeare\u2019s.\nHow it would have benefited from a\nsimilar treatment! If only the writers\nand directors had the courage to\ndelve into the deep melancholy of\nit all, the heightened drama, the\nnuances of plot and language \u2013 the\nbeautiful writing is all there! But\nthe effect of a potent scene is too\noften quelled by a visual gag in the\nfollowing moments.\nAnd this was the other thing \u2013\nonly too frequently a decidedly\nsomber moment in the story\nwould incite uproarious laughter \u2013\nsomething that would be entirely\njarring and out-of-place in a serious\nShakespearean tragedy, which is\nessentially what the source material\nSaturn, dark side of the rings.

The poem is one\nof the oldest works of literature in\nrecorded history; bits of it date to\nbefore the origins of London some\ntwo-and-a-half millennia ago. It\nis by far the longest literary work,\na whole order of magnitude above\nthe Illiad and Odyssey combined.\nIt is also a text of considerable\nimportance \u2013 historians (notably,\nW.J. Johnson et al.) argue that it is\nA potent\nscene is too\noften quelled\nby a visual\ngag\nis, at least much more than it is a\ncomedy sketch. Maybe my only\nfault is that I have read it.\nBut let us not dwell on what could\nbe. What is, is a delightful, comical,\nentertaining play, to anyone who\nsees it with fresh eyes.

A seething,\npulsing, billowing, boiling ball of\nred, white and orange, against a\nfeatureless black backdrop. On its\nquietest days, the panel describes,\nthe Sun is \u201csobering\u201d; when in a\nmore volatile mood, it is \u201cdownright\nterrifying\u201d. There is a great macabre\nbeauty to the ball of fire, almost\nLovecraftian \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that\nthose of creative persuasion are\ndrawn to it. There are at least three\nyoung artists sitting and sketching,\nand one child has been fixated by it\never since I walked in.\nMercury, Venus and Mars are\ntheir usual hostile selves. However,\nbeauty rears its unexpected head\nin all the starkness \u2013 the way\nsunlight bounces around Mercury\u2019s\ntumultuous topography creates a\nsofter day-night divide that we see\non Earth, and Mars\u2019s global dust\nstorms shroud its giant canyons in a\nveil of red. Speaking of Mars, there\nis a picture of Curiosity looking\nback on its tracks, and it is poignant\nbecause it\u2019s almost a metaphor\nfor humans looking back at their\nfootprints \u2013 which one wishes we\ndid half as often as rovers do.\nLeaving human footprints\nbehind, we arrive at the gas giants\n\u2013 Jupiter, its stormy self, and Saturn\nprofoundly affecting with its\ngraceful, almost perfectly geometric\nform. If Jupiter is the roman God of\nsky and thunder, Saturn is a ballet\ndancer with hula hoops. The rings\nreflect so much light onto Saturn\u2019s\nnight side that there \u201ca perpetual\ntwilight lingers\u201d. Ultimately, the gas\ngiants are outshined by their moons\n\u2013 particularly beautiful is a picture\nof Enceladus, one of Saturn\u2019s moons\n(and not a Mexican appetiser)\nwhich erupts a vast spray of water\ninto space that immediately freezes\ninto a column of ice.\nThe photos of the outer planets are\namong the most remote views ever\nwitnessed by Man.They appear cold\nand distant, but even they too have\nan unexpected side to them. Last\nyear, we flew by Pluto for the first\ntime \u2013 and what we discovered was\nthat the dwarf planet\u2019s atmosphere,\nbacklit by the sun, was as blue as\nearthly skies. One wonders if the\ngrass, too, is greener, on the far\nside of the solar system. It is a lot\nto take in. One gets a sense that the\nplanets are dynamic,graceful things,\nrather than featureless hunks of\nrock. Often, heavenly bodies are just\nspecks in the sky,but in Otherworlds,\nthese dots in the firmament become\nliving, breathing entities, colourful,\ncommanding, awesome, awe-inspiring \u2013 they are, almost literally,\nthe biggest and most pristine\nspectacles that could ever be viewed.\nAnd here they\u2019ve captured them on\ncamera.\nAbhinav Varma\nWriter\nThe biggest\nand most\npristine\nspectacles\nthat could\never be\nviewed\nart and science\u201d,and\u201csimultaneously\nreveal the ethereal beauty of far-off\nworlds and clues to how the solar\nsystem\u2026began\u201d.\nAnd reveal this it does. Unlike\nwith most photographic exhibitions,\nthe puppeteer of our heartstrings\nis, in this case, not human beings\nbut machines \u2013 machines named\nRosetta, Lunar Orbiter, Magellan,\nViking Orbiter, and Curiosity,\namong others. They are the probes\nand robotic spacecraft that wind\ntheir weary path around the cosmos,\nceaseless, untrammelled by friction\nand resistance in ways that most\nhuman photographers can never be.\nThey are the farthest manifestations\nof our eyes, and indeed, most\nremote incarnations of the human\nobserver. The images they obtain\nare random, largely unguided, and\nyet those are the images that most\nmove us. It\u2019s funny \u2013 we are so\nused to the terrestrial terrain that it\ntakes a skilled eye and an artist of\ngreat creativity to inspire us with\nthe everyday sights around us; not\neveryone can be a photographer on\nEarth. But these cosmic subjects,\nso perfect are they in their form,\nmovement, and composition that\n\n"

Photo Credit: Facebook / GRUPA\nH\nere\u2019s a picture of\nMalaysian PM Najib\nRazak. Malaysian\npolice responded to\nthis image by warning the author\nthat the image was \u2018offensive\u2019. They\nthen threatened that if he didn\u2019t\n\u2018act within the law\u2019, he would be\narrested.\nThis, of course, had nothing to do\nwith the fact that someone rich and\npowerful decided they didn\u2019t like\nlooking the clown.\nOf course, no such autocratic\nresponse to criticism would\ncross the minds of our very own\ndemocratically elected leaders here\nat Imperial.\nInstead, when one is the Union\nPresident and faced with a critical\narticle, the union merely \u201cstrongly\nadvises\u201d that it be removed from\nprint. Then, oddly enough, one\u2019s\nsubjects (or, students?) are told that\ncontinuing to distribute the article\nis \u201celevated harassment\u201d. Right.\nThere\u2019s a lot more at stake here\nthan Lucinda\u2019s blushes.\nThis \u2018ban\u2019 is yet another example\nof college and the union interfering\nwith the right of students and staff to\ncomment and criticise. Freedom of\nexpression isn\u2019t without restrictions.\nBut I doubt that anyone who reads\nPrivate Eye (never mind Hangman)\nwould be in the least surprised at\nI doubt that\nanyone\nwho reads\nPrivate Eye\nwould be\nin the least\nsurprised\nat the style\nof RAG\u2019s\npublication\nProtecting\nthis right of\nexpression\nis a legal\nobligation\nthe style of RAG\u2019s publication.\nIn fact, it seems much more likely\nthat the Union\u2019s treatment of RAG\nbroke its own policy in its treatment\nof RAG than in anything RAG\nwrote about the union.\nFor the body charged with\nsafeguarding and protecting us\nas students, this is shameful.\nFor starters, there\u2019s the legal\ngobbledygook coming out of\nBeit. To quote their own policy:\n\u201cHarassment is always linked to\nanti discrimination legislation,\nand thus will focus on sex, gender\nreassignment, marriage\u201d.\nThese are known as protected\ncharacteristics. Unless the union\ncan prove that the President was\nspecifically targeted for abuse due\nto one of these, the accusation of\nharassment is completely baseless.\ni.e. apparently the union thinks\nthe RAG article sexist. Was it?\nHaving read said article, and given\nthe treatment handed out to a \u2018Fen\nBernando\u2019, this claim is utter trash.\nTo quote IC FemSoc in full:\n\u201cThough we can\u2019t comment on other\naspects of the article, the committee\nof ICFemSoc (which does not\nnecessarily represent the opinions\nof all it\u2019s members, or all feminists)\ndoes not believe the article in itself\nis sexist\u201d.\nIn short, the case for the union\nbehaving as it did is shot. As a\nsource close to RAG commented:\n\u201cThey just didn\u2019t follow their own\nrules\u201d. Truly, Ms. Sandon-Allum,\nI find it \u2018unacceptably insulting\u2019\nthat someone within your union\u2019s\nmanagement thought they could\nget away with it.\nThebasicquestionisthis.Ifthecase\nfor the article being harassing is so\nflimsy, on what basis exactly did the\nunion go around hauling students\ninto meetings, demanding apologies\nand generally applying pressure?\nThese underhand, opaque tactics of\n\u2018banning-but-not-banning\u2019reek of a\nculture of political face-saving over\ndemocratic principle.\nPerhaps Ms. Sandon-Allum and\nteam simply haven\u2019t read their own\npolicy.\n\u201cBullying: The exercise of power\nover another person through\npersistent,negative acts or behaviour\nthat undermines an individual\npersonally and/or professionally.\u201d\nDespite this wacko logic,President\nA. Gast went so far as to call the\narticle in question \u2018disgusting\u2019 and\nwarmly welcomed the above \u2018strong\u2019\nresponse.\nBy apple pie and eagles, it\nstaggers me that anyone can be\npaid \u00a3421,000 a year, and yet be\nseemingly so unaware of her own\nobligations. To quote the Imperial\nCollege Constitution:\n\u201cSo far as is reasonably practical,\nfreedom of speech within the law\nwill be secured for students and staff\nof the college.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a luxury. Protecting\nthis right of expression is a legal\nobligation on the college and it\u2019s\nleaders (have a read of the Education\nReform Act 1988 or Education Act\nNo. 2, 1986).\nProfessor, since when has it\nbeen \u2018strong\u2019 to be so blas\u00e9 about\nacademic freedom?\nThe problem with constitutions is\nthat they are only as good as their\ndefenders. Take the Malaysian\nexample. Article 10 of the\nconstitution begins: \u201cEvery citizen\nhas the right to freedom of speech\nand expression\u201d. Despite this, PM\nRazak has used the Sedition Act\nover 91 times this year. This is a\n1948 act, designed with the express\npurpose of preventing revolt against\nBritish rule. Article 3a) reads: \u201cIt is\nan offence to bring into hatred or\ncontempt or to excite disaffection\nagainst any Ruler or against any\nGovernment\u201d.\nIs it seditious of me to wonder\nexactly what the difference is\nbetween our dear old Imperial\nUnion\u2019s position and the colonialists\nof yesteryear?\nThe biggest \u2018discredit to the\ncollege\u2019s legacy\u2019 from this farce is\nthat the words of President Gast\nand the behaviour of ICU sets\na precedent that fundamentally\nthreatens the scientific integrity of\nthe college.\nScientific integrity does not\njust stop at the lab door. It is the\nfundamental principle that there\nis no topic too hard or painful that\nwe don\u2019t have a right to discuss and\nexamine. If we lose that as a college,\nwe\u2019re dead.\nTruth is, the union has not had\nit too tough, but too easy. As one\nstudent commented on a recent\nFELIX article: \u201cthe Sabbs are so\nunaccountable for their (lack of)\nactions.\u201d\nThat\u2019s got to change.\n\n"

Photo Credit: RAG\nW\nho\u2019s to blame for the\ngender imbalance\nat Imperial, and\nin science and\nleadership in general? \u201cNot me\u201d,\nyou\u2019re thinking. For the vast\nmajority of you, that\u2019s correct. But\na tiny proportion of our community\nfails to recognise their role in\ncreating that awful reality.\nThe institutional culture\nsurrounding gender at Imperial is\nnot an inevitable fact of life. It is\ncreated, and sustained, by people\naround you, right here, right now. In\nthe same way that no one raindrop\nconsiders itself responsible for the\nflood, no one person considers\nthemselves responsible for the fact\nthat Imperial can be, on occasion, a\nhostile environment for women.\nNo one\nraindrop\nconsiders\nitself\nresponsible\nfor the\nflood\nBut sometimes, it becomes\npossible to pinpoint a single action\nor incident that perpetuates this\nreality. I can say with complete\nconfidence that the actions of the\nRAG committee in publishing the\nRAG mag with offensive content,\nbased on tired stereotypes about\nwomen and drawing upon aspects\nof my personal life, has directly\nled to women deciding against\ntaking up leadership roles in our\nstudent community. I know this\nbecause students that have been\nconsidering a future as Union\nPresident or one of our Deputy\nPresidents have now seen how a\ntiny minority of our students act.\nIt\u2019s clear that some individuals think\nthat tradition justifies bullying, or\nthat it\u2019s somehow acceptable not\nto challenge your peers about what\nthey say or do, or to refuse to take\npersonal responsibility.\nThese actions have led to a female\nstudent withdrawing their run for\na position of leadership, for fear of\nbeing subjected to the same abuse.If\nthis is the way a few loud voices treat\na woman in leadership, via trollish\nstereotyping and personal attacks, it\nis not a surprise that other female\nstudents have been discouraged\nfrom aiming for a leadership\nposition. And so, Imperial\u2019s gender\nimbalance lives on for another year.\nBeing an adult is about taking\nresponsibility for the consequences\nof your actions, and the individuals\ninvolved in writing that piece need\nto accept what they have done\nand the impact they have had.\nAs students we all have a duty of\nresponsibility and mutual respect.\nIf these values are not upheld and\nboundaries are crossed, the people\naccountable must confront their\nunacceptable behaviour.\nEvery student is entitled to speak\nfreely, but the RAG mag is an\nattack on this. Freedom of speech\ndoes not equate to freedom from\nconsequences. This is an issue the\nFELIX editor tackled herself in her\neditorial on the 29th\nof January.\nBy condemning the article,\nImperial College Union is in\nno way preventing RAG from\nraising money. As a previous RAG\ncommittee member and a huge\nsupporter of the society I want them\nto be as successful as possible.\nHowever, we want RAG week\nto be a success, not a scandal. It is\nperverse to argue that raising money\ncan only be successful by being cruel\nand \u2018joking\u2019 about natural tragedies.\nRAG week charities support victims\nof ill health, war and poverty. One\ncharity, Porridge and Rice, works to\nempower Kenyan women to break\nfree from the cycle of poverty \u2013 a\nworthy goal, undermined by using\nsexist stereotypes as publicity for\nfundraising.\nThe RAG mag writers must take\nfull responsibility for the reduced\npublicity they have caused for\nthis week of fundraising. They\nhave potentially discouraged\nparticipation, donations and\nsponsorship by tarnishing RAG as\na group that permits and enables\nbullying.\nWe must stop this culture that\naccepts bullying, accepts fewer\nwomen leaders, and dresses up\npersonal attacks as \u2018tradition\u2019 or\n\u2018satire\u2019. It is not acceptable for\nan article to be written to target\nan individual\u2019s personal life, and\neven more so depicting someone\u2019s\nmurder.\nI know that the majority of\nImperial students have no time for\nbullying, tasteless personal attacks,\nand gendered stereotypes masked\nas \u2018banter\u2019. I am and will always\nbe proud of the work I\u2019ve done\nas Union President to encourage\nyoung women to study science and\nto take the challenge of leadership.\nI would love to say that equality\ncan solely be achieved through\noutreach projects and publicity, but\nthey are only half the battle. The\ndeeper challenge is to confront and\nuproot prejudices and structures\nthat support and enable gendered\nattacks on women - even, or\nespecially, when disguised as \u2018banter\u2019\nor \u2018tradition\u2019. It is just cold, hard\nreality that the path to equality\nis blocked by damaging habits,\ningrained prejudices, corrosive\nbehaviours and plain old bullying\nand harassment.\nI am grateful for the support I\nhave received - from President Alice\nGast to student groups,societies and\nstaff,all appalled by the behaviour of\nthese few individuals. Together, we\nwill stand up to sexism and bullying\nwherever we see it.\nThe RAG\nmag writers\nmust\ntake full\nresponsibility\nfor the\nreduced\npublicity\n\n"

This was the\nlast time he was seen. Missing for\nthree years and presumed dead, he\nwas suddenly discovered in Linares,\nSpain. Or was he? Well, his family\nsaid it was him. In fact, they were\nentirely sure. This confirmation was\napparently enough for US embassy\nofficials and the FBI,who celebrated\nthe return of Nicolas with the\nfamily. The issue is that the Nicolas\nthat went missing 3 years prior had\nblue eyes and a thick Texan accent.\nThe person who turned up had\nbrown eyes and a French accent...\nIt seems unbelievable but it\u2019s all\ncompletely true. With a real world\nset-up this good how could the film\nnot succeed?\nThere are a lot of unanswered\nquestions in this film but one thing\nis certain: there was an imposter.\nThis pretender was 22 year-old\nFrench-Algerian Frederic Bourdin:\nan obsessive-yet-talented con man,\nwho turned out to have a long\nhistory of impersonating various\nchildren. The misidentification by\nthe family was predicted by Bourdin,\nwho is interviewed in the film; all\nhe had to do was capitalise on a\ngrieving and desperate mother and\nsister, who we realise were probably\nwilling to believe anything. In the\nend Bourdin was exposed by largely\none man \u2013 private investigator\nCharles Parker.\nThe whole film gorgeously\nunfolds in the style of a classic\nthriller. Re-enactments are used\nextensively to set the tone and\nallow the documentary to take a\nmore narrative form. Normally,\nwhen someone says the phrase \u2018reenactments\u2019 to me, images of cheap\nand cheesily shot scenes come to\nmind, but this is definitely not the\ncase here \u2013 the realism and style is\nsuperb.\nDirector Bart Layton really\nsucceeds in maintaining tension\nand mystery throughout.We are not\ngiven all the information we need\nright away,and my opinions changed\nseveral times throughout the film.\nSeveral questions are raised and\nnever answered: Did the Gibson\u2019s\nreally think Bourdin was their son?\nDid they convince themselves out\nof desperation? Perhaps they had an\nulterior motive? If so, what motive\nwould explain allowing a stranger\ninto your house? I won\u2019t spoil the\n\u2018oh my God!\u2019 moment of this film\n\u2013 a moment which honestly makes\nyou question everything you\u2019ve\nbegun to think up until that point \u2013\nI\u2019ll just say that it gives you a good\ncentral point when you debate the\nquestion of \u201chow the hell did he get\naway with it?!\u201d\nOverall, The Imposter is a\nmasterfully assembled documentary.\nTakeing the form of a documentary/\nmockumentary fusion with the\nbest aspects of both genres being\nextracted, The Imposter is uniquely\naccomplished for a documentary\nfilm, in terms of both tension and\nedge-of-your-seat filmmaking.\nWith dyed hair, Frederic Bourdin walks through a high school hallway as Nicolas Barcley.

Altogether, this amounts to\n\u00a3250,000\u2019s worth of rent. They are\ndemanding a 40% cut in prices and\na rent cap for future students. The\nstudents are split between two halls,\nbut most are in one in Camden.\nAlthough the halls are well-known\nfor having cockroaches and mice,\nthey aren\u2019t nearly as bad as the\nhalls involved in UCL\u2019s previous\nsuccessful rent strike. In these halls,\nloud building work was audible all\nday every day in bedrooms during\nImperial accommodation \u2013 a history of dissidence\nYou\ncannot be\nacademically\npenalised for\noutstanding\nnon-tuition\nfee debts\nthe exam period, despite promises\nthat renovations would be over in\nmonths.\nPerhaps the most interesting\nthing to come of UCL\u2019s previous\nrent strike is that it actually worked.\nLast year, students withheld rent\nand held protests at several halls\nand were eventually reimbursed for\none term\u2019s rent. UCL had initially\nwarned the students that they could\nface academic sanctions if they\ndidn\u2019t pay, but these threats were\nswiftly removed after legal warnings\nfrom the government. Consumer\nrights bodies also reminded UCL\nand its students that you cannot\nbe academically penalised for\noutstanding non-tuition fee debts.\nEven without the threat of no\ngraduation, is such a display of\nfinancial dissidence realistic here at\nImperial? Students often complain\nabout the high rents in first year,\nbut after that, we tend to disappear\ninto the private housing system. If\nfirst year students were effectively\nmobilised as they were at UCL, it\nwould be possible.\nOrganisers of UCL\u2019s Cut the Rent\ncampaign told FELIX that the\nrent strike had been organised by\nsimply knocking door to door in the\nhalls concerned. At the suggestion\nthat some campuses are more up\nfor direct action than others, the\nrepresentative told us something\nalong the lines of: if you can do it\nhere, you can do it anywhere.\nCut the Rent told us that a critical\nmass of students involved was\nneeded, not only for the plan to\nwork, but for other students to join\nin and the campaign to snowball.\nTheir successful rent strike had\nbetween a third and half of the\nresidents striking.\nIt\u2019s easy to complain that students\nat Imperial aren\u2019t interested in the\npolitical, or social justice issues,\nbut over the years when it comes\naccommodation, students have\nproved that they do care.\nIn 2014, the college conducted\na Residential Experience Review,\nwith one of the outcomes being a\ndedication to transparency, but little\nevidence of this has been seen.\nLast year, Weeks halls was shut\ndown. The hall wardening team at\nthe time had no idea that this was\neven on the cards, and only found\nout that union council had voted\nto support the college\u2019s closure\ndecision after having seen FELIX\u2019s\nTwitter feed the next day. After an\nemergency council meeting, and\ntwo re-votes, council once again\nchose to support the closure of the\nhalls. Although Woodward rents\nwere reduced from college\u2019s original\nplans, the union\u2019s \u2018Against Acton\u2019\ncampaign arguably came far too late\nto succeed.\nGarden hall is still empty, and\nhas been for three years now.\nProtests and change.org petitions\nwere bandied about back in 2013\nbut to no avail. Imperial\u2019s most\noversubscribed hall was shut down\nat the end of that academic year. As\nurgent as the space was needed by\ncollege,reportedly for offices,it took\na further two years for the furniture\ninside the halls to be removed.\nFees rebates at Imperial are\nnot unheard of. Several first-year\nstudents at halls across Eastside and\nXenia have complained that the size\nof their rooms are not consistent\nwith others in their rent band and\nhave received sizable amounts of\ncash back. There is obviously a\njump from this to not paying any\nrent at all, but it\u2019s not an unfamiliar\nconcept to private landlords like\nthose running Xenia or university-run halls.\nEssentially, it\u2019s a case of university\nprofit over student experience,\nbut with the government\u2019s higher\neducation green paper likely to go\nthrough, student satisfaction will\nsoon affect how much universities\ncan charge in tuition fees. For\nthis reason, top universities like\nours will be more eager than ever\nto improve National Student\nSatisfaction survey scores, and as\naccommodation is such an implicit\npart of your experience, it should\nbe high up on Imperial\u2019s list of\npriorities.\n2013 2014 2015 2016\nAgainst Acton campaign launch\nGarden hall closed\nEvelyn Gardens closure announced Weeks hall shut\nEvelyn Gardens reopens\n\n"

In other words, this is about\na third of their income from this\nyear\u2019s member subscriptions.\nThe club's social activities remain\nbanned until further notice,\nhowever, they are still allowed to\ntrain and last week did so with a\nBritish Rowing coach.They are also\nset to compete this weekend.\nUnion officials met with boat club\ntrainers and the hotel this week\nas part of their now completed\ninvestigation. The findings are\nnot yet public, as they will have to\napproved by the Union's governance\ncommittee before any further action\nis taken.\nThe \u00a32050 fine was paid in full\nby the boat club last week, and\nwill presumably go towards what\nthe hotel claimed were substantial\ncleaning costs and a smashed toilet\ndoor.\nAllegations about the boat club's\nbehaviour surfaced two weeks\nago, after the hotel made a series\nallegations regarding students'\nbehaviour at the event. These\nincluded one student reportedly\n\u201cvomiting all over [the] manager\nA\nfter further talks and\na 24 hour strike this\nweek, Jeremy Hunt\nhas announced that\ncontroversial new junior doctor\ncontracts will be imposed on medics.\nDuring talks between the\ngovernment and the BMA that\ncontinued during Wednesday\u2019s\nstrike, a \u201cfinal deal\u201d was rejected\nby the doctors\u2019 union. The BMA\nhave called it a \u201ctotal failure on the\ngovernment\u2019s part\u201d.\nOn Thursday evening, junior\ndoctors, supportive members of\nthe public and medical students,\nincluding the ICSMSU President\nand the Deputy President of\nWelfare attended at impromptu\nprotest outside the Department of\nHealth on Whitehall. They held\nplacards and reiterated that the\nBMA would not stop fighting.\nIt is unclear where junior doctors\ncan go from here, but in a press\nrelease, the chair of the junior\ndoctors committee for the BMA\nsaid: \u201cJunior doctors cannot and\nwill not accept a contract that is bad\nwhile he was explaining to you\nthat the function was going to be\nstopped due to the behaviour\u201d.\nThe hotel also said there had been\ndamage to equipment, vomit found\nin \u201ccorridors and staircases around\nthe hotel\u201d and food thrown at staff.\nPayment\ncame\nstraight from\nthe club\u2019s\nown account\nfor the future of patient care, the\nprofession and the NHS as a whole,\nand we will consider all options\nopen to us.\u201d\nAssuming the government\u2019s latest\noffer was enforced on junior doctors,\nthe new system would be phased in\nfrom August of this year. In his last\nletter to the BMA,the government\u2019s\ncontract negotiator, Sir David\nDalton, said this would be likely to\ntake 12 months to roll out across\nall NHS Employers in England.\nThis means any medical students\ngraduating at the end of this year\nwould likely be immediately under\nthe new contract.\nOn Wednesday Sir Dalton advised\nJeremy Hunt to do \u201cwhatever\nnecessary\u201d to conclude the dispute\nafter the BMA refused what he had\ncalled an\u201cimproved offer\u201d.Yesterday\nthe shadow health secretary, Heidi\nAlexander, said Hunt\u2019s \u201cdesire to\nmake these contract negotiations\ninto a symbolic fight for delivery\nof seven-day services\u201d had led to \u201ca\nsituation which has been...\"\ncontinued on page 4\n\n"

The release of \u2018Formation\u2019 24\nhours before upstaging Coldplay\nat their headline gig at the Super\nBowl could be a new high. Not only\nthe manner of its release, but the\nmessage it sends, at once politically\ncharged and gloriously celebratory,\nmakes \u2018Formation\u2019 one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\nmost powerful songs yet.\nReleased together with the\nvideo, the song is so reliant on the\nimagery to put forward its message,\nit seems impossible to discuss\nthe song without referencing the\nvideo as well. Directed by Melina\nMatsoukas, who also directed\n\u2018Pretty Hurts\u2019 and Rihanna\u2019s \u2018We\nFound Love\u2019, the video feels more\nart-house than those that usually\naccompany Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s songs. An\nad lib from the murdered Youtube\nstar and bounce artist Messy Mya\nintroduces a montage of post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans;\nclapboard houses into floodwaters\nact as a visual shorthand for the\nchronic underinvestment by the\ngovernment of black communities.\nFootage from Abteen Bagheri\u2019s\n2014 documentary That B.E.A.T.\ncuts to reveal Beyonc\u00e9, squatting on\ntop of a sinking New Orleans police\ncruiser with raw buccaneer swagger.\nHer voice when she starts to sing\nis hoarse, gravelly; closer to Nina\nSimone or Ella Fitzgerald than\nIn its rap-adjacent, repetitive\nlyrical pattern \u2018Formation\u2019 has\nsome stylistic themes common\nwith \u20187/11\u2019. However, whilst \u20187/11\u2019\nis a carefree dance anthem about\nyouth and hedonism that as a result\nof its hotel setting is somewhat\ngeneric, \u2018Formation\u2019 is grounded\nin a particular experience, deeply\nentwined with the imagery of the\nblack South.\nThe video weaves through the past\nand present, from the antebellum\nSouth to Southern gothic, from the\nchurches that serve as the nucleus\nof the Southern communities, to\ntake-away crayfish, Red Lobster,\nand hot sauce. This is a celebration\nand affirmation of identity from\nBeyonc\u00e9 who has sometimes been\naccused of acting \u2018too white\u2019. \u201cMy\ndaddy Alabama, momma Louisiana\n/ mix that negro and the creole make\na Texas bama\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 declares,\nrooting herself in her Southern\nancestry, reclaiming racial slurs,\nPerhaps she is reminding herself\ntoo: \u201cearned all this money / but\nthey\u2019ll take the country from me\u201d.\nIt must be difficult to reconcile her\npresent \u2018Givenchy dress\u2019level wealth\nwith her less affluent childhood, so\nit is particularly sweet when she\ndeclares \u201cswag\u201dto be a bottle of \u201chot\nsauce in [her] bag\u201d.\nThis is about more than\nreclaiming a personal identity, it is\nalso a reclamation of the narrative\nsurrounding black Southern\ncommunities, and black women.\nIt is joyous and celebratory in the\nface of discrimination, violence, and\noppression. It tells us: don\u2019t believe\nwhat you see on the TV, this isn\u2019t\ngangland, these communities are\nmore than acts of police brutality\nand grief. By inhabiting black\nwomen from the past, Beyonc\u00e9\nis holding up a picture of black\nancestry that opposes the imagery\nthat the mainstream media\npropagates, indicting a media that\nrewards showing black suffering\n(Twelve Years a Slave) but refuses\nto acknowledge the stories black\ncommunities write for themselves\n(Straight Outta Compton).\nThis is not about what other\npeople think or want, this is a\ncelebration of the beauty of black\nwomen by a black woman, about\npride and self-love. Beyonc\u00e9 sings\nabout all the features that society\ntells black women they should\nfind unattractive in themselves. \u201cI\nlove my negro nose with Jackson\nFive nostrils\u201d she says, \u201cI like my\nbaby hair, baby hair and afro\u201d she\ntells us, as we see her four year old\ndaughter Blue Ivy playing, her afro\nbouncing. Later Beyonc\u00e9, her own\nhair in a big, blown-out afro joins a\nlineup of black women with afros to\ndance. There\u2019s no mention of butts\nor curves or plump lips, the features\nthat the white media fetishise in\nblack women whilst condemning\ntheir noses and their kinky hair.\nThe power of black women\ncoming together was underscored\nduring Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s half time\nperformance at the Super Bowl.\nWearing gold bandoliers, looking\nlike a glam guerrilla leader crossed\nwith Michael Jackson circa 1993,\nflanked by dozens of black female\ndancers, wearing black berets\nin homage to the radical Black\nPanthers Party, Beyonc\u00e9 and the\ndancers joined together to give the\n\u2018black power\u2019 salute made famous\nby Olympic athletes Tommie Smith\nand John Carlos in 1968.\nThroughout, \u2018Formation\u2019 is far\nmore radical and outspoken than\nwe might\u2019ve expected, there is no\nquestion of looking at the subtext or\nreading between the lines.In a video\nfilled with iconic images, one of the\nmost striking is towards the end.

Volunteer Dinner was\ndreamt up as an answer to my own\nproblems. Like many volunteering\ngroups, the strength of our society\nis built on the strength of our\nteams and every term we\u2019re faced\nwith new challenges, from finding\nsponsorship to training. It\u2019s easy to\nsee other similar volunteer societies\ntackling the same problems yet\nthere are very few opportunities to\nfind out how they overcome their\nchallenges.\nUnlike sports or arts, there are\nno drunken Wednesday nights at\nthe Reynolds/Metric for alcohol-induced bonding. And as much\nI enjoy getting drunk and could\nimagine myself chanting \u201cVolunteer\nfor old people! Volunteer for old\npeople!\u201d grabbing onto unfortunate\nnearby strangers, there\u2019s something\nthat just doesn\u2019t seem right about\nthat image. It\u2019s not what normally\nsprings to mind when thinking\nabout the galas and balls usually\nassociated with volunteering.\nVolunteer Dinner is all about\nfinding out more about each other\nand how we can help one another.\nVolunteers are a similar breed and\nthe truth is, if you\u2019re a student\nwilling to give up copious hours\nof your time to help out others,\nwithout the need for recognition or\nglorification then you have a unique\ncharacteristic or virtue.\nOne of the promotional ideas for\nthe Volunteer Dinner was to release\na \u2018Humans of New York\u2019 style\nvideo series to Facebook entitled\n\u2018Volunteers of Imperial\u2019 where we\u2019d\nask two or three questions to get\nvolunteers to chat with the camera.\nOut of this we found almost every\nvolunteer had very similar answers:\nI do it because I love helping people\nand being there to listen to their\nstories and their hardships. I do it\nfor my team, working together to\nface worthwhile challenges. I just\nenjoy volunteering, there\u2019s nothing\nmore to it.\nSo,if you\u2019re a volunteer,or if you\u2019re\ninterested in finding out more about\nvarious volunteering societies and\nmeeting the committee of these\nsocieties, then this a dinner for\nPwC Presents: Volunteer Dinner organisational committee.

We\u2019ve got a really nice venue\n(Double Tree by Hilton hotel),\nsome great musical entertainment,\nsome prizes to give out and a really\nawesome menu. Plus, support from\nPwC\u2019s sponsorship is letting us keep\nit cheap. So please consider coming\nand I hope to see you there!\nPicocon 33: Origins - 20th\nFebruary\nP\nicocon is a small\nconvention run by Imperial\nCollege Science Fiction\nand Fantasy Society\n(ICSF). It is one of the only entirely\nstudent-run conventions, and it has\nbeen held in late February each year\nfor 33 years \u2013 this February 20th\nmarking Picocon 33.\nPicocon has a long history of\nhaving Guests of Honour, who are\nfamous or up and coming authors\nin the Sci-Fi or Fantasy genres,\nincluding Cory Doctorow, Jaine\nFenn, Alastair Reynolds, Frances\nHardinge and many more. These\nGuests of Honour (GoH) give talks\nabout their books and the theme of\nthe year.\nThis year\u2019s GoH are Michelle\nPaver, Author of The Chronicles of\nAncient Darkness, Paul Cornell,\nprevious screen-writer for Doctor\nWho, and author of several comics\nand the novels Shadow Police series,\nand Carrie Hope Fletcher who\nplayed Beth in the War of the Worlds\nmusical. Her debut fantasy novel,\nOn the Other Side, is coming out this\nsummer. She is currently playing\nEponine in the West End in Les\nMiserables.\nThere is an author\u2019s panel where\nthe authors can be asked questions\nby the attendees, and Turkey\nReadings in collaboration with\nRAG, where examples of books\nso badly written are read out so\nthat people will pay to prevent the\nreading from continuing (or to\nmake it keep going!).\nSilly Games is an event where we\nimitate various gameshows, and we\nalso have Destruction of Dodgy\nMerchandise, where examples of\nterribly misguided merchandise are\nbid on to be saved or dunked in\nliquid nitrogen and smashed by the\nhighest bidder. The proceeds from\nall go to charity.This year,as last year,\nStuart Ashens is coming to Imperial\nfrom the Youtube domain to chair\nthe auctioning of the merchandise.\nAlongside the games and panels\nthere will be a variety of stalls selling\neverything from our own Picocon\nmerchandise to jewellery and even\nprofessionally illustrated prints by\nAutun Purser.\nThe Pub Quiz will be in Metric,\nwith teams captained by our GoH!\nFinally,we also have an event known\nsimply as Harmless Fun.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s\nPicocon event is \u2018Origins\u2019. Upon\ninvestigation, there were two origin\nstories for the convention \u2013 one\nbeing that it was a gathering of\nICSF members to play board-games at another\u2019s house which they\ndecided to simply escalate; the other\nbeing that the first ever Picocon was\nactually an organised ICSF trip to\na different convention in Glasgow,\nwhereupon the group decided that\nthey should make a convention like\nthat themselves! Picocon\u2019s name\nwas reportedly coined by Steven\nBarnett, when it was observed that\nit was a very small convention \u2013\nearning it the prefix \u2018pico\u2019!\nPicocon has come far over the\nyears, from a trip to a different\nconvention entirely (or board games\nin a flat!) to a well known London\nSci-Fi convention. This year, it will\nbe held on Saturday 20th\nof February.\nRegistration beings at 9am on the\nday in Beit Quad. Tickets can be\nbought from the union website\nor on the day at registration, with\nconcession prices for students\nand further reductions for ICSF\nmembers.\nNOOR N MULHERON\nGuests of Honour, Michelle Paver, Paul Cornell and Carrie Hope Fletcher.

For the\nfirst time, neuroscience societies of\nthe five London medical schools\n\u2013 Imperial, UCL, King\u2019s College\nLondon, Bart\u2019s and St George\u2019s\n\u2013 collaborated to put together\nthe weekend affair, consisting of\nkeynote speeches and a wide variety\nof symposia organised by each\nneuroscience society, as well as a\nposter prize session.\nKeynote speakers included Nobel\nLaureate in Physiology or Medicine\n2014 Professor John O\u2019Keefe,\nwho spoke to an overflowing SAF\nlecture theatre about his discovery\nof \u201cplace cells\u201d that form a kind\nof \u201cinner GPS\u201d of the brain, for\nwhich he was awarded the Nobel\nPrize. Professor John Donoghue,\nwho hails all the way from Brown\nUniversity in the states, was here to\ntalk about his work which allows\nparalysed people to control artificial\nlimbs with their thoughts. Professor\nMaria Spillantini travelled from\nCambridge to talk about her work\non neurodegenerative disease, while\nSir Colin Blakemore spoke about\nthe workings of perception.\nIn addition to the impressive lineup of big names in neuroscience,the\nselection of symposia showcased\nthe latest research in all aspects\nof neuroscience, from a panel\ndiscussing artificial intelligence to\na neuroscience ethics workshop to\nan exploration of the interactions\nbetween neuroscience and art.\nImperial\u2019s Neuroscience Society\norganised the wildly popular brain\ndissection workshop by Professor\nSteve Gentleman, where delegates\ngot to see first-hand the dissection\n(but who is now a developing\nnormally as a toddler) was filmed\nat the conference, as delegates were\ninspired by the family\u2019s story and a\nshort presentation on the science\nbehind it. The conference was also\na fantastic networking opportunity\nfor students in the field,as they were\nintroduced to the most exciting\nresearch and the people involved.\nDelegates had a chance to mingle\nwith top researchers in the field\nduring the wine reception (which\nfeatured a live band!) as well as learn\nfrom each other during the poster\npresentation session.\nOver the two days, the conference\nattracted almost 400 delegates\nfrom all over the country and even\na significant number from abroad.\nThey were a mix of undergraduate\nmedical students, masters and PhD\nstudents, as well as post-doctoral\nresearchers and professionals\nworking in related fields such as\nmusic therapy.\nThis would not have been\npossible without the contributions\nand hard work from all the\nuniversities, fulfilling LSNeuroN\u2019s\naim to foster collaboration among\nthe neuroscience community in\nLondon. This is its biggest event\nto date, and a promising testament\nto the variety and quality that can\nresult from such a collaboration.\nThe organising committee with John O\u2019Keefe.

Photo Credit: FELIX\nI\nn this week\u2019s FELIX, the\nUnion President has spoken\nout on last week\u2019s RAG mag\ncontroversy. Contents of the\nmagazine, although technically\nnot banned, caused the union to\nstrongly advise RAG to dispose of\nthe 1600 undistributed copies after\nthe union had seen the contents.\nOne page in particular was said to\nbe \u201cbeyond the acceptable bounds of\nsatire or mockery\u201d and that further\ndistribution would be considered\n\u201celevated harassment\u201d.\nIn her comment piece, Lucinda\naccuses the writers of \u201cunacceptable\nbehaviour\u201d, \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201cpersonal\nattacks\u201d. Stating that she believed\nthe piece to be sexist in outcome, if\nnot in motivation.\nHowever, Imperial College\nUnion\u2019s own feminist society have\nsaid that they do not believe the\npiece was sexist. In a statement\nto FELIX a representative said:\n\u201cThough we can\u2019t comment on other\naspects of the article, the committee\nof ICFemSoc (which does not\nnecessarily represent the opinions\nof all its members, or all feminists)\ndoes not believe the article in itself\nis sexist\u201d.\nLast week, the union promised\nRAG a reprinted magazine for\nfree, providing the offending page\nwas replaced with a Leadership\nElections advert. On Saturday,\nRAG\u2019s Facebook page was\npromising a new digital version of\nthe magazine, but by Tuesday, there\nwas still no new flyer, either printed\nor digital. On Wednesday, the union\npaid for the print of double-sided\nA5 cards advertising RAG\u2019s few\nremaining events, rather than a\nreprinted magazine as promised.\nDespite being near the end of RAG\nweek, volunteers distributed the\nnew \u2018magazines\u2019 around campus.\nThe non-ban has ironically given\nthe RAG mag more attention than\nthey could\u2019ve hoped for and the\ncomment section under FELIX\u2019s\nonline news piece on the matter is\nfull of people asking where they can\nget their hands on the contraband\nreading material. Several\ncommenters lament what they call\nthe union\u2019s \u201cattack on free speech\u201d,\nwith one only saddened at the fact\nthat the mag was \u201creally unfunny\nand gives satire a bad name\u201d.\nThis wasn\u2019t the only problem RAG\nfaced this week. As Storm Imogen\nbattered the UK on Tuesday, it\nwas deemed too windy for their\nfundraising bungee jump to take\nplace.\nDespite harsh words from\nImperial President, Alice Gast, on\nthe contents of the controversial\nmagazine, senior college\nmanagement still aided with\npancake making on Monday, as is\ntradition. Other RAG events have\ncontinued this week without a\nhitch: the RAG ball at Cafe de Paris\non Tuesday, a 24-hour broadcast\non IC Radio that raised \u00a3165, and\nQueen\u2019s Tower and underground\ntunnel tours.\nGrace Rahman\nEditor-in-Chief\ncontinued from front page\n...led to \u201ca situation which has\nbeen unprecedented in my lifetime\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, junior doctors\ntook part in a 24 hour strike, with\njunior doctors only providing\nemergency care. Up to 3000\noperations were cancelled but\npublic opinion of the junior doctors\nremains mostly favourable.\nOn Saturday hundreds of junior\ndoctors, medical students and\nsupporters joined a \u2018silent\u2019 march.\nThe protesters sat down in the road\noutside Downing Street, many\nwearing surgical masks.\nFashion designer Vivien\nWestwood and actress Vanessa\nRedgrave spoke passionately about\ntheir experiences with NHS staff at\nthe event.\nThe next day, Health Secretary,\nJeremy Hunt, appeared on the\nBBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show and\nblamed the media and the BMA for\nthe anger amongst junior doctors at\nthe potential contract changes.\nHe also specifically accused the\nBMA of distorting his words,which\nhe called \u201cone of the cleverest trade\nunions in the book\u201d.\nA\nPhD student from\nImperial has led a\nteam from the Aerial\nRobotics Lab to victory\nin a competition to find \u2018Drones for\nGood\u2019 in Dubai.\nTalib Alhinai\u2019s winning entry is a\nprototype that can detect faults in\npipelines and then deposit a liquid\npolyurethane foam to seal them.The\nfoam is lightweight and can expand\nup to 25 times its original size after\nbeing applied to damaged pipes.\nLeaks from pipelines cause all sorts\nof problems throughout the world,\nwith as much of 25% of drinking\nwater being lost due to leaks. Dubai\nloses about 10% of its water in this\nway, so the judges took a particular\ninterest in this entry.\nThe competition involved national\nand international awards, with\nImperial\u2019s \u2018Buildrone\u2019 taking the\nnational prize.The Imperial winners\nwere personally congratulated by the\nruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed\nBin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nThe prize was a million Arab\nEmirates Dirhams, or about\n\u00a3190,000.

The\nleft and right vaginas carry sperm\nto the two uteri at the top, whilst\nthe middle vagina delivers the\njellybean-sized joey from one of the\nuteri to the mother\u2019s pouch. This\narrangement also allows the female\nkangaroo to be perpetually pregnant:\nwhilst one joey is developing inside\nher pouch, another embryo can be\nheld in stasis, waiting for its sibling\nto grow up and move out.\nVaginas, naturally, require penises\nto perform their reproductive\nfunction. And although some might\nreassuringly claim that size doesn\u2019t\nmatter, it\u2019s clear that some species\nhave missed the memo. If you\u2019re\nsmiling, though thinking of the\nsperm whale when envisioning the\nbiggest penis out there, wipe that\nsmile off your face. It is in fact the\nbanal beach barnacle that has the\nbiggest willy (relative to body size)\nof the animal kingdom. Somewhere\nbetween eight and 40 times the\nlength of their body.\nOf course you don\u2019t strictly have to\nbe male to sport a penis; take hyenas\nfor example. Being aggressive is\nuseful within the hyena community\nand the feistier the mother is, the\nmore androgen, a male sex hormone\nlinked to aggression, she passes to\nher young. Female hyenas with a\nlot of androgen develop clitorises\nthat can be up to 7 inches long,\nso lengthy it\u2019s often mistaken for\na penis. During birth the clitoris\nbecomes the birth canal for a cub to\nsqueeze its way through. Yikes.\nSpeaking of willies, male\nducks have one that\u2019s long and\nanticlockwise spiralling. When\nit\u2019s flaccid it\u2019s tightly coiled, but as\nsoon as it enters a vagina it becomes\nerect within a third of a second with\nejaculationhappeningjustasquickly.\nMales often force themselves upon\nfemales and reports of duck gang\nrape are quite common so female\nducks have evolved vaginas that\ntrick the males. Their vaginas are\nfilled with trick openings so if she\ndoesn\u2019t want to have sex she can\ndirect the male to ejaculate in a\ndead-end but when she does, she\ncan relax internal muscles to make\nsex easier.\nBut most likely, the prize for\nweirdest penis goes to the Echidna,\nknown also as the spiny anteater.\nThis strange looking member of the\nmonotremi, has an even stranger\nlooking member consisting of one\nshaft with four heads. Each time\nit has sex, two of these heads shut\ndown and release sperm into the\nfemale\u2019s two-branched vagina and\nalternates heads the next time it\ncopulates.\nIf you enjoyed these facts come\nand hang out with I, Science at\nIf you think the echidna doesn\u2019t look that weird, A) really? B) you clearly haven\u2019t\ntried to have sex with it.

However, a recent study\nsuggests that forests regrowing in\nEurope after mass deforestation\nbetween the 18th\nand 19th\ncentury\nare actually contributing to global\nwarming rather than helping to\nreverse it; despite the fact they are\n10% larger than the pre-industrial\nrevolution woodlands. This poses\na real problem for those hoping to\nreverse the effects of climate change\nvia reforestation, with over 85% of\nmodern European forests regulated\nby human management.\nResearchers from the Laboratory\nof Climate Science and\nEnvironment in France, recreated\nthe last 260 years of human forest\nmanagement through computer\nmodelling; taking into account,\nbiodiversity, harvesting methods,\nand background temperature\nfluctuations. The results suggested\nthat in the 260 years, up to 2010,\nthe addition of 200,000 km2\nto\nwoodland in Europe led to a\nMadeleine Webb\nWriter\ntemperature increase of 0.12\u00b0C.This\nnumber on its own may not seem\nthat significant, but the researchers\nhave said that the increase in\ntemperature equates to about 6% of\nthe global warming attributed to the\nburning of fossil fuels. According to\nthe study\u2019s leader Dr Kim Naudts,\n\u201cEven well managed forests today\nstore less carbon than their natural\ncounterparts in 1750\u201d. Hence, this\nstudy calls into question how well\nwe understand our ability to combat\nclimate change as a global issue.\nThe paper argues that the key\nissue with the forests under\nhuman management is the change\nin species composition, relative\nto a composition which would\notherwise naturally occur. More and\nmore forest managers have chosen\nto replant trees that are proven to be\nfast growing and highly profitable\nto make any projects sustainable.\nHowever, trees that fit such specific\ncriteria, such as Pine and Spruce,\nabsorb more heat than native and\npreviously abundant deciduous\nspecies, such as Oak or Birch;\nmeaning more energy is retained in\nour atmosphere,warming the planet.\nAdditionally, these conifer species\nrelease less cooling water into the\natmosphere, which affects both the\nlocalecosystemandthewiderregion.\nThese two factors caused a 0.08%\nIn the 260\nyears up to\n2010 The\naddition of\n200,000\nkm2\nof\nwoodland in\nEurope led\nto a\ntemperature\nincrease of\n0.12\u00b0C\nHuman forest management, a waste of time?

A 1992 study\nin Nature presented data showing\nthat expanded forest regions in the\nupper northern hemisphere could\nbe detrimental as those regions\ntended to be snow covered for large\nsections of the year. It was found\nthat snow, even if present only\nseasonally, reflected more energy\nthan the conifer trees could.These\nfindings may be only strictly related\nto European reforestation projects,\nsince the results are so closely linked\nto the history of the continent. On\nthe other hand, this process of\nmass deforestation and managed\nreplanting isn\u2019t exclusive to these\nregions alone, so conservation\ngroups worldwide will need\nunderstand this situation in order\nnot to make the same mistakes.\nHuman managed forests are pushing out Europes native species, such as the\nOak.

It heralded a most intriguing\nsymposium on mechanisms of\npsychiatric disorders, with a special\nfocus on Anorexia Nervosa.\nAnorexia is predisposed by\ncertain character traits such as\nperfectionism and obsessive habit\nrigidity. Thinness is heralded as the\nessence of substance \u2013 the sad but\ntrue irony ingrained in the mindsets\nof those affected. It is indeed true\nthat these traits may be labelled\nas inherent, but not many of us\nare aware of the danger of their\ndevelopment following what would\ninitially seem to be a perfectly\ninnocent,healthy approach to losing\nweight.\nWe\u2019ve all experienced the\ncommon scenario of having a friend\n(or yourself) wanting to be healthy.\nYou start exercising more and eating\nhealthier,understandingthenuances\nof maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\nIt\u2019s all well and good, until the very\nthing you use for self-betterment\n\u2013 Google\u2019s myriad of resources\ndetailing every nutritional aspect of\neach food that touches your lips \u2013\nturns around to stab you in the gut.\nThe sheer volume of information\nwe have at our fingertips is also our\nbiggest enemy when it comes to\ntreatment of psychiatric disorders.\nThe neurobiological changes\ninitiating anorexic behaviour in\npatients are enhanced by apps, such\nas myfitnesspal; apps which many\ndieters rim with halos. So what is\nthe problem with logging every\ncalorie ingested and every gram of\nfat tallied? Focus is transferred from\nmaintaining health to counting\ncalories. Everything essentially\nbecomes a vicious numbers game.\nOne ends up choosing a small piece\nof candy over an avocado just to\nfit into an appropriate intake. That\npiece of toast with butter and jam\ngoes from being breakfast to half\na day\u2019s intake, to toast without any\nbutter and jam, to simply an item\nwith an invisible, paltry calorie\ncount plastered on its surface.\nOnly numbers rule. The anorexic is\ntrapped in a formidable, monstrous\nworld of counting. Nutritional\nbalance is impaired; restriction takes\nits place as the norm.\nThis rigidity knocks kinks into\nAll about the numbers \u2013 waist measurements and calorie counts.\nPhoto Credit: Benjamin Watson\nAlexandra Lim\nWriter\nThe neurobiology of Anorexia\nA glimpse into the calorie counting culture promoted by fitness apps\nstimuli. Hence, we are better off\nwithout the constant stressing over\nnumbers. After all, the human brain\nhas evolved to preserve space for so\nmany other more important things.\nthe typical human reward circuitry\nsystems.These are mainly located in\nthe ventral striatum \u2013 a major part\nof the basal ganglia, controlling the\nreward system \u2013 and orbitofrontal\ncortex \u20130 a prefrontal cortex region\ninvolved in decision-making. The\nmore one loses weight, the thinner\none gets, and it is this thinness\nthat activates higher ventral striatal\nactivity in acute anorexic control\npatients. This invokes an increased\nventral striatum response. Over\ntime, neural connections are\nfurther disrupted, compulsivity and\nobsession over intake and outtake\nare expatiated. Whilst people of\nnormal weight gratefully succumb\nto the occasional chocolate-studded\nmuffin, in anorexic patients, food\nreward is perverted towards low\nenergy dense foods, with fMRI\nscans showing increased frontal pole\nactivity when shown high-calorie\nfood pictures, displaying greater\naversion to them. This impaired\nbalance interrupts interoceptive\npathways, and guess what serves\nonly to trigger this inappropriate\nlusting after \u2018safe\u2019 foods all the time,\ninstead of giving in to the occasional\ncupcake? Yes,that dieting app which\nhelped you drop the pounds in the\nfirst place, convincing you that the\nlower the number, the better.\nIt is important to note here that\nrecent studies have confirmed that\neven calorie counts are simply\nmere guesses at best; hindered by\nindividual differences in gut flora,\nfood intolerances and environmental\nIron supplement safety questioned\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nA\nn investigation of the\ngenetic mechanisms\nactivated in reaction\nto the elevated iron\nconcentration, and a subsequent\nexamination of the cells in higher\ndetail, revealed that just within ten\nminutes, cells treated with the iron\nsolution had activated DNA repair\nsystems, which were still activated\nsix hours later.\nOf course, the idea that excessive\niron can cause serious damage to\nthe human body isn\u2019t a new one.\nIron overload and iron related\ntoxicity can cause mitochondrial\ndamage, cytotoxicity and apoptosis\nand promote problematic growth of\nfibrous and cancerous tissues.\nHowever an insufficient amount\nof iron in the body can also be\nunhealthy. Iron deficiency can cause\nanaemia, in turn causing a range\nof symptoms, such as tiredness,\nlethargy, a shortness of breath, and\nheadaches.\nIron deficiency is in fact so\nwidespread that six million\nprescriptions are issued each year\nfor iron tablets in England and\nWales alone, and it is estimated\nthat it affects over 3.5 billion people\nworldwide.\nWith the consumption of such\ngreat quantities of iron supplements,\nit is crucial to further investigate\npotential health risks.\nAs put by Dr Shovlin, \u2018\u2019This study\nhelps to open the conversation\nabout how much iron people take.\nAt the moment, each standard\niron tablet contains almost 10\ntimes the amount of iron men are\nrecommended to eat each day \u2013 and\nthese dosages haven't changed for\nmore than 50 years. This research\nsuggests we may need to think more\ncarefully about how much iron we\ngive to people, and try and tailor the\ndose to the patient.\"\nSo maybe have a chat with your\nGP before throwing out your iron\ntablets.\nImperial research suggests iron uptake through supplement use may damage cells\nA \u2018lucky iron fish\u2019, a cast iron fish to cook with that is meant to enrich food with\niron, claiming to successfully helping against iron deficiency and iron deficiency\nanaemia.
