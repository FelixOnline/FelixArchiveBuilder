    "content": "About Town\nActon Venture Day\nAt the end of the last academic year Imperial College Community Action Group donated \u00a3250 to the Acton\nSaturday Venture Club. The Club, which runs a play centre for youngsters with special needs, used the money\nto fund an outing to Chessington Zoo. Alistair Goodall went along to investigate.\nThe weather was none too good as\nwe drove to the zoo whilst the two\nvans picked up the children from\nthe Acton area.\nThe sky relented in time for the\narrival of the vans with their full\ncomplements of children, although\nI'm not sure just how many went\nbecause nobody was in the same\nplace for long enough to be counted.\nAccording to the club's annual\nreport, there are '29 members aged\nbetween 6 and 24 with a predominance\nof youngsters with special needs,\nincluding those with physical and\nmental disabilities and their able-bodied\nfriends'. This extract doesn't do\njustice to the pack of loud,\nexuberant and very energetic kids\nwho make it all worthwhile.\nEveryone managed to stay\ntogether as we went round the\nChildren's Zoo with its rabbits,\nguinea pigs and other furry\ncreatures. There seemed to be a slight lack of rustic knowledge when\ndonkeys were greeted by a 'Moo'\nand horses by a 'Baaa' but this was\nsoon rectified with some great, if\none sided, conversations.\nThe signs to all the rides soon\nproved all too alluring and so,\nimpatient to risk life and limb, small\ngroups of children and helpers soon\ndashed off in search of this World\nof Adventure.\nHalf an hour after we had\narranged to re ndez vous at the\nentrance we were still missing one\nchild who was in a wheelchair. We\nfound out that he had gone off with\nsome other people unrelated to the\nClub (there's nothing like being\nindependent!).\nFor myself the nicest aspect both\nof the day out and the normal\nSaturdays is the way that the\nchildren are so ready to trust you\nand 'be friends with you'. This\nplaces a responsibility on you not to\nabuse their trust in any way but at\nthe same time it lets you into their\ngroup where you really can have a great time.\nICCAG's involvement with the\nClub is limited to putting people in\ntouch with them and having a student representative on their\nCommittee. The club meets on\nalternate Saturdays at a purpose-built play centre for disabled children\nand go on a number of trips\nthroughout the year. The activities\nat the play centre can range from\npushing a child on a bike, to\nhandicrafts and baking. Volunteer\nhelpers are supposed to 'assist\nyoungsters with their games and\ncreative attempts'. In practice this\nmeans that they can have great fun\nand can act in a childish manner\nwithout anyone noticing.\nShould you be interested in this\nor any other form of voluntary work\nthen get in touch with ICCAG via\nthe pigeonhole in the Union Office\nor come along on the Soup Run\n(meet Thursdays, 9.15pm in Week's Hall Basement Kitchen) which is our\nother main activity.\nSquash\nThe Imperial College Union\nPostgraduate Group hosted the\ninter-departmental postgraduate\nteams squash championship at the\nSports Centre on July 12.\nThe eight teams vying for the\nProfessor Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson\nTrophy were split into two groups:\nGroup A: Civil Eng, ICCC,\nManagement Science A, Chem Eng.\nGroup B: Materials, Management\nScience B, Physics, Mech Eng.\nThe tournament was organised\nalong the lines of the European\nfootball championships with the top\ntwo teams from each group\nqualifying for the semi-finals. The\nqualifying round was complicated\nby the fact that each department had\nto play in twelve matches with a restriction that a player could not be\nused more than twice. The team\ncaptains could use a team of\nminimum strength or use players\nonly once and go for a player\nparticipation bonus by using more\nthan the minimum strength team,\nsince the bonus points for player\nparticipation were significant they!\ncould not be ignored.\nThe group qualifiers saw Civ Eng\nand ICCC, with Materials and Mech\nEng go through from Group A and\nB respectively\nSemis\nThe semi-finals provided a lot of\ndrama. After the qualifying matches\nICCC, Materials and Civ Eng all\nlooked possible winners.\nEveryone knew that Materials\nversus ICCC was going to be close.\nMing Tan beat Steve Berry 9-2, 9-4\nin a match of power play which saw\nnot a single drop shot. John\nMcCairn (ICCC) beat Richard\nSweeney (Mat) equally convincingly\n9-2, 9-2. Alex Brennan (ICCC) beat\nJon Durn (Mat) 9-1, 9-1. ICCC had\nwon two matches and lost one and\nthey lead by an accumulated total of\n42-23 ball points. Things looked\nominous for Materials because even\nif the Materials lady won her match\n9-0, 9-0 Materials would still be\npipped 42-41. However it had been\ndecided that in the event of a team\nwinning two matches and also\nloosing two matches against an\nopponent, the winner of the ladies\nmatch would decide the tie break.\nThe Materials lady had everything\nto play for and took her team into\nthe finals.\nThe other semi-finals saw Mech\nEng beating Civ Eng after the Civ\nEng captain and squash supremo\nAlison West did not use the best\nfour players at her disposal.\nFinals\nThe finals were not as close as one\nwould have hoped, Materials ran\nthrough easy winners, after winning\nthe first three matches, leaving the\nladies match to be inconsequential.\nThe squash tournament finished\nat 8.15pm after over 10 hours of play\non all four courts.\nThe final order of the teams was:\nChampions Materials\nRunners up Mech Eng\n3rd ICCC\n4th Civ Eng\n5th Physics\n6th Management Sci A7 th Management Sci B8th Chem Eng\nThe trophy presentation in\nSouthside Upper Lounge saw ProRector Professor Brian Coles name\nthe trophy after Sir Geoffrey\nWilkinson Nobel Laureate who is\nretiring from the College this year\nand was a keen squash player at one\ntime. The trophy was presented to\nMing Tan, veteran of Material's victory in 1987.\nEditorial\nHamlet Gardens: The student\nmanagers at Hamlet Gardens have\nbeen harrassed and threat end by\nsquatter vigilantes since the\nbeginning of the Summer. The\nsquatters have been evicted, but\nthey left Hamlet in a disgusting\ncond it on. I visited one of flats after\nit had been cleaned; the stench was\nsickening. More sickening though is\nthe College's laissez fair approach.\nYear after year, FELIX runs stories\nabout the damm age caused by\nsquatters. The student managers\ncan not be expected to cope with the\nproblem by themselves; unless\nsomething is done, the squatters\nwill return at the end of the\nSummer. Loretto O 'Callaghan and\nthe managers have done an\nexcellent job, but they should not be\nexpected to do the job alone.\nCongratulations to Dave Smedley\nfor completing the Union Handbook\nand to Adrian Bourne for\ncompleting City and Guild's handbook, Spanner.

    "content": "News\nContinued from front page.\nSummer Letting Scheme finishes.\nMrs O 'Callaghan is considering\nplans to give students a weeks free\naccommodation in an attempt to\nensure that the flats are not left\nempty.\nMrs O 'Callaghan is critical of the\nlack of support given to her by the\npolice. \"Hammersmith Police\nStation is very unhelpful and didn't want to get involved\" she said. She\nis currently negotiating with the\nCollege to persuade them to take the\nsquatters to court for assault. She\nhas asked College to help with the\ncosts, should the student managers\ndecide to prosecute.\nCollege Security Chief, Geoff\nReeves told FELIX that the College\nhad no plans to hire security guards\nto police Hamlet when the flats are\nvacated at the end of Summer. He\nsaid that the flats were too dispersed\nto police effectively and added that\nsecurity firms would be unwilling to\ndeal with the squatters, who he\ndescribed as 'psychopaths'. He\nwent on to say that the only legal\nway of removing squatters was to\napply for a coi qt in ju ct ion,a process\nwhich can take months.\nMr Reeves is planning to write to\nthe Commissioner of Police, the\nSecretary of State for the\nEnvironment and the Home\nSecretary in an attempt to prevent\nthe problem recurring. \"We need to\nget the law clarified with respect to\nour property\" said Mr Reeves.\nBreak-In\nThere was a break-in at Garden Hall\nlate on Wednesday night. One of\nthe video games was completely\ngutted and the pool table had the\nglass ball shoot smashed and ripped\nopen.\nThe incident was discovered by\nSecurity at 3.30am and the police\nwere called. Although there must\nhave been a lot of noise when the\nfront was ripped off, splitting the\nwood, none of the residents heard\nanything: One resident claimed to\nhave seen people playing pool\naround lam when he came home.\nThe police returned yesterday to\ntake fingerprints and the games\nmachine owner came to collect the\nmachine, 'Karnov', which he says\nshould be returned by Friday.\nNew Tutor\nDr David Goodgame, Senior Tutor\nin the Chemistry Department, has1 been appointed as a new College\nTutor.\nComputer Stolen\nAn IBM 8D Computer system,\nvalued at \u00a36000 was stolen from the\nRector's Electrical Engineering\nOffice on July 15th. The incident is\njust one in a series of computer\nthefts which have cost the College\ninsurers an estimated \u00a3110,000.\nAmongst the computers stolen\nwas an IBM Landmark Rt\nComputer, one of only three in the\nworld, which was taken from the\nRoyal School of Mines in April. The\ncomputer was valued at \u00a342,000.\nThe spate of thefts began at the\nstart of the year when a BBC\nmicrocomputer was stolen from\nICU's Microcomputer Club in the\nUnion Building. Since then 26\ncomputers have been taken from the\ndepartments within College.\nThe thefts are believed to be the\nwork of ex-members of College.\nSecurity Officer Terry Briley told\nFELIX that many ot i he thefts were\ncaused by people leaving their\noffices unlocked. He added that\nthieves were able to by-pass the\nsecurity desks by using back exits\nleft open by members of staff on\ntheir way home.\nA description of two men who\nwere seen attempting to steel a computer in the Electrical\nEngineering Department on 28th July has been circulated to College\nSecurity. The men are described as\nbeing of Asian origin, one 5ft6 and\nstocky with a beard and the other\n5ft9, thin with dark spike y hair. The\nmen have been seen loitering\noutside the departments where the\nthefts have occured. Mr Briley has\nasked anyone seeing these men to\ncontact Security on 5372.\nHamlet Gardens after the squatters\nr Accomodation\nA new accommodation block for\npostgraduate students is to be built\nat Silwood park. The College will be\ntaking out a loan to build the new\nblock which will be paid back by\nincreases in student rents. The new\nblock will replace the William\nPenney block which is to be used for\nshort course accommodation.\nStudents at Silwood are pleased\nby the move as they feel that the\nWilliam Penney block is unsuitable\nfor long term students. The block\nsuffers from poor lighting, small\nkitchens and very poor sound\nproofing between rooms.\nRefit\nAsbestos\nContractors have removed frayed\nasbestos lagging from the\nUnderwater Club. The asbestos,\nwhich was found to be in a dangerous condition was replaced\nby expanded foam cladding. The\nCollege Estates Section arranged for\nthe asbestos to be removed after\nUnion President Sydney HarbourBridge threatened to call in the\nHealth and Safety Executive. Estates\nalso plan to remove the asbestos\nfrom a fire door in the Scout &\nGuide storeroom and the Union are\npressing for asbestos in a storage\narea beneath Biet to be cleared.\nThe Sherfield refectory is being\nrefurbished over the Summer at a cost of \u00a3300,000. The new look\nrefectory will feature padded chairs,\nformica tables and a suspended\nceiling designed for easy\nmaintain ance. Three serve ries are\nplanned with illuminated display\ncases for the food with new\nentrances and exits designed to cut\ndown queueing time. Two of the\nserve ries will serve tra dt ional refectory meals, whilst the third will\nserve pasta and salads. A public\naddress system, paid for by the\nQueens Gate trust will enable the\nrefectory to be used for social\nfunctions.\nThe College has agreed to pay out\n.an extra \u00a330,000 for a lighting\nsystem designed by the Rector's wife, Clare Ash. The system,\nconsisting of about fifty low voltage\nlamps and twenty two wall lights\naimed at the ceiling, will replace the\noriginal economy strip lighting\nplanned for the refectory. Mrs Ash\nis also planning to redesign the\ncolour scheme in the new refectory.\nRefectory Manager, Rob Northey\ntold FELIX \"I hope its going to be\na hell of a lot less like a school dining\nroom\". The project is due for\ncompletion by September 25.\nUnfortunately there are no plans to\nrefurbish the range of food on offer.\nMerger\nImperial College officially merged\nwith St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool last Monday. The Bill\nenabling the merger recieved Royal\nconsent on 29th July and the College\nwill now be known as Imperial\nCollege of Science, Technology and\nMedicine.

The Postgraduates at the Park are\nworried about the effect that the centre1 will have on their own facilities.\nThey are concerned that they will lose married student accommodation,\nkitchen facilities and access to the Main House for social events.\nThe college hope to earn money not for selling drinks.\nby building a centre which will\nprovide accommodation for thirty\npeople. The centre will contain a restaurant and private dining room\nand the College are considering a plan to use profits from Harlington\nGravel to build a swimming pool\nand a squash court for conference\nguests, staff and students.\nPlans for the centre have been\ndraught ed and the Biology\nDepartment has been moved into\nnew buildings to make room for the\ncentre. The College is currently\ntrying to raise money for the project,\nestimated at between 1.4 and 4\nmillion pounds and is hoping to\nconduct a feasibility study on the\nscheme.\nShould the project prove\nsuccessful the College plan to\nconstruct an accommodation block\nfor conference guests and a new\nlecture theatre in the Main House.\nThe students at Silwood are\nconcerned that the development will\ncause the loss of the Student's Union's facilities. The long term\nfuture of the Union building is\nuncertain and the Union fear that\nthe building may have to be\ndemolished to make for the planned\nexpansion in the Conference Centre\naccommodation. In an interview\nwith FELIX on Wednesday, Estates\nSecretary, Mr Cameron Clark said\nthat there were no immediate plans\nto use the Union building, but said\nthat it \"may or may not be the sight\nfor a new accommodation block\" in\nthe future.\nThe Student's Union are also\nunhappy about a plan to move the\nbar in the union building into the\nMain House. The Postgraduates will\nbe able to use the old bar area, but\n\"Its no use having a split Union\nwith a bar on one site and facilities\non another\" said Union President,\nIan Lowles.\nThe new bar is expected to serve\ndrinks at an increased price to\nconference guests, but will be open\nto students in the evening for drinks\nat a cheaper price.\nThe development will mean the\nloss of three flats for married\nstudents and the Union are hoping\nin use, that it is unsuitable for\nfamilies and that it has insufficient\nkitchen and bathroom areas. At\npresent the Southwood II block\ncontains 4 couples, two of which are\nin single rooms, 2 families and two\nsingle students.\nStudents are also worried that they\nwill lose access to the Main Hall and\nConservatory which are regularly\nused for social events. The College\nhas given verbal assurances to the\nStudents that they will be able to\nbook rooms in the centre on a 'first\ncome first serve' basis, but it is likely\nthat they will have to book the\nrooms a number of months in\nadvance. The union fear that this\nto appoint an Accommodation\nOfficer to try and locate cheap flats\nfor married students in the Reading\narea. Since the sale of Sandyride\nhouse in April, Silwood has lost five\nof its flats for married students. Mr\nCameron Clark told FELIX that\naccommodation for married\nstudents was available in the\nSouthwood block which contains\ndouble rooms which can be\ninterconnected. The Union argue\nthat this accommodation is already\nwill put an end to their social events.\nSilwood administrator Keith Fisher\ntold FELIX that he didn't think that\nthis would be a problem, \"It may\nmean that students have to get\norganised to use the house\" he said.\nIt is unlikely that the Silwood Ball,\norganised by the Royal College of\nScience Union will be able to take\nplace next year. Work on the new\ncentre is set to begin in the Spring\nof next year.\nTrashed!\nThree groups of squatters were\nevicted last Friday from the student\nresidences in Hamlet Gardens\nfollowing a court injunction. The\ns qua her s have caused several\nthousand pounds worth of damage\nand have been threatening the\nHamlet Gardens staff with violence.\nSome of the squatters have since\nbroken into another Hamlet\nGardens flat owned by the Notting\nHill Housing Trust.\nThe squatters have been living in\nflats 131,137 and 135 the since they\nwere vacated at the end of last term.\nThe occupants of one of the flats had\nbeen living in the College's2.00 block since Christmas until they\nwere evicted by builders working for\nthe landlords, Strolmor at the end\nof term.\nThe squatters have been regularly\nhurling abuse at the student\nmanagers in Hamlet's Summer\nLetting Scheme. One of the\nmanagers, Steve Mercer, told FELIX\nthat the squatters had hit him in the\nribs with a snooker cue and said that\none of the squatters had threatened\nto set a vicious dog onto the staff.\nSeveral residents have also been\nthreatened including an old lady\nwho is now too frightened to talk to\nthe police. The managers also\nbelieve that the squatters are\nresponsible for a burglary in one of\nthe flats on July 18th in which Hi Fi\nand jewelry were stolen.\nAccommodation officer, Loretto\nO 'Callaghan told FELIX that the\nsquatters had left the flats in a disgusting state. One of the flats\nwas covered in abusive graffiti\ndirected at the student managers.\nContract cleaners refused to clean\nanother flat where the squatters\nkept a dog and eleven puppies\nlocked inside. The furniture inside\nanother flat had been thrown out of\nthe windows.\nThe Accommodation Office is\nworried that the squatters will move\nback into the flats when the\nContinued on back page.\nISSUE 8 0 8 12 AUG 1988\n\n"

He\nestablished a strong culinary reputation in Holbein House after serving\na number of gastronomic wonders in events as diverse as gourmet\nlunches to international dinners.\nThe 'eight jewel stuffed duck' (Cantonese), the 'almond flavoured\nsteamed rice pudding' (Chekiang Province), Rogan Josh and Chicken\nTikka are just some of the gastronomic delights which have graced\nhis table\nYishu's infectious love for food soon spread to the pages of FELIX.\nHis gastronomic survey of the world aimed to inspire students to be\nadventurous when eating abroad. The ambitious gastronomic itinerary\nincluded Thessalonika, Paris, Rome, Venice, Delhi and Lagos.

Four years in LibeJa (West Africa), six years in\na Polish school in England, his love for Chinese and Italian food have enriched his Indian culinary heritage.

The\nappetizers were priced in the 90p to\n\u00a33.10 price range. I settled for the\nclassic starter of 'Proscuitto Melone'\n(\u00a32.80). Anyone who has not eaten\nthis special salted and air-dried ham\naccompanied with melon slices\nmust try it.\nThe others dining with me had\nthe garlic bread (90p).I was a little\nsurprised to find the bread in the\nform of thin but large discs which\nhad been baked and rubbed with\nolive oil and garlic.\nThe main course choices were\npriced at around \u00a33.50.
