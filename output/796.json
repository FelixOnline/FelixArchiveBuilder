    "content": "MANIFESTOS\nPRESIDENT Nigel D Baker, proposed by John Noble\nI believe that the job of ICU President is to represent\neach and every student at Imperial College, not just\nthose who choose to visit the Union Office.\nTherefore one of my main aims next year is to\nintegrate the Overseas Students more into college\nlife, especially in the area of entertainments.\nSince the issue of accommodation affects all\nstudents I intend to examine the present residency\nsystem with a view to implementing any changes\ndeemed necessary. Having lived in the Fremantle,\nLinstead and Hughes Parry halls I have seen a variety of accommodation and this will help in the\nstudy. I feel that a fresh, independent approach is\nrequired.\nDuring my second year I was Bar Manager of\nHughes Parry Hall and as well as dealing with a \u00a330,000 turnover I was responsible for the\nemployees that worked in the bar. This experience\nwill be invaluable next year since the President has\noverall responsibility for the Union Permanent staff.\nAs this year's Rag Chairman I have sat on Union\nCouncil and seen the way the Union works. The\nUnion reorganisation that took place in January was\nabsolutely necessary and it is something I wholeheartedly supported. This support is essential\nsince it will be up to next year's Executive to ensure\nthat the new system operates effectively.\nImperial College has always had a reputation for\nsportsmen of a high standard and this should be\nmaintained. However Union funding must be for\nall standards of sportsmen, beginners and\ninternationals alike, and this is something I wish\nto ensure next year.\nHit it with your best shot and vote for experience\nand dedication.\nVote Nigel D Baker for ICU President.\nPRESIDENT Brendan O 'Brien, proposed by Adrian M. Bourne\nBrendan is the ideal candidate for ICU president.\nHe is a pleasant, 2nd year physicist with relevant\nwork and societies experience. He has been fixtures\nsecretary for IC Cricket Club and during last\nsummer he worked on a building site as a nav vy. Brendan's gentle Irish accent, his bald patch and\nhis sense of humour are legendary. He has had me\nliterally stuck to my seat on occasions!\nI urge you to vote for Brendan O 'Brien, the Eddie\nEdwards of IC!\nAdrian M. Bourne.\nBrendan's Dozen\nAs ICU President, I intend to do the following:\n1) Fight the introduction of LECTURE\nVOUCHER\u2014co zI won't get any!\n2) Free pint of beer for everyone who says they\nvoted for me, whether they did or not.\n3) Kick out lecturers who display red noses\nwithout actually putting one on in the morning.\n4) Double IC Rugby Club's budget.\n5) Refuse Miss PG Halls the right to live in\nWeeks Hall next year, whoever she is.\n6) Declare South Kensington as the Peoples'\nRepublic of Cheapskate and keep out loud\nAmericans with fat wives and checked trousers.\n7) Get me a job as a nuclear power station stoker\nor an astro nautical rubbish collector in\nAstrophysics.\n8) Get ICU to support all outbursts by English\ncricketers in Pakistan, and bring Shakoor Rana on\nfrom the City End.\n9) Send relief to Ireland for the Potato Famine.\n10) Annexe Ireland as a colony of Cheapskate.\n11) To promote public awareness of the Irish\nPotato Famine by organising a College-wide strike\nso that the lecturers are free to go and distribute\nbaked potatoes outside the Houses of Parliament.\n12) To make FELIX sell the litho and use potato\nprinting instead.\n13) At Commemoration Day, dispense with\ntraditional robes and wear Batman suits instead.\nBrendan O'. DEPUTY PRESIDENT Charles Brereton, proposed by Amin El-Kholy\nHaving known Chas since last June, I have seen\nhow well he is motivated to helping students. As\nAcademic Affairs Officer he has taken on a heavy\nworkload. Through this he has shown his\ncommitment to students and his ability to motivate\nthose working with him. Chas also has a great deal\nof experience dealing with College administrators\nthrough committees. He is approachable, easy to\nget on with and I am convinced he can take on the\nconsiderable responsibility of the post of DP.\nAmin El-Kholy,\nComputing Dep Rep.\nThere are 3 basic parts to the new DP's job:\nFinance and Administration: I want to rational is e the Union's accounting procedures in co-operation\nwith the Union Finance Officer so that the\nproduction of Estimates can be made easier.\nServices: The Union's trading outlets need\nrejuvenating so that they can be run profitably yet\nproviding a better service for students. I want to\nexpand by taking over Southside Shop in the coming\nyear because at present it does not provide a good,\ncheap service for students. The Union Building is\nalso in desperate need of refurbishment; I support\nthe introduction of a Union Manager with whom\nI will work to make the Union Building the best\nin College\u2014the place that students will want to go\nto eat, drink or social is e. The resulting increased\nrevenue can be used to improve facilities.\nRepresentation: I intend to take responsibility for\nAcademic Affairs and either or both of Postgraduate\nand Overseas students representation. My\nexperience in dealing with senior academics on\nCollege committees will be useful here.\nTo sum up, I am standing for DP because I believe I am the only candidate with the experience\nand motivation to do the job properly.\nSo VOTE CHARLES BRERETON.\n10 Friday March 4th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "News\nMajority support strike\nIn one of the biggest protests ever by\nICU, some 2,250 students out of a total of 3,400 supported last\nTuesday's strike. Thirty-one of the\nclasses polled were in favour of\nstriking. Of the exceptions, Mining\nEngineering stayed in because of a visit by the University Grants\nCommittee (UGC) to the department,\nwhile Mech Eng 2 had split labs.\nSome 70 ICU students also attended\nthe AUT/TUC lobby at the Houses of\nParliament and were able to speak to\nlocal MPs, Mr Peter Brooke and Sir\nBrandon Rhys-Williams.\nUnion President, Sydney HarbourBridge described this as a positive\ncontact, which he hoped could be\nfollowed up later. He has expressed\nall his thanks to those who supported\nthe action, and in particular staff for\nre-arranging lectures and the ProNUS Society for putting up posters,\nand Neil Motteram, Amin El-Kohly\nand Alan Rose for carrying out the\nballots.\nMr Harbour-Bridge was, however,\nconcerned to hear that Life Sciences\n1 were under the impression that they\nwould be docked marks for an\nassessed lab, if they went out on\nstrike. Though FELIX has now\nreceived assurance from the\ndepartment that this will not happen.\nMr Harbour-Bridge also regretted not\nhaving time to clear up some\nconfusion in Aero 2, where the\nAcademic Rep considered the voting\nto have been carried out\nun satisfactorily. In the event,\nhowever, the lecture was cancelled in\naccordance to the original result.\nMr Harbour-Bridge hopes to follow\nthe strike up with a letter writing\ncampaign by students to their local\nMP. The main points to be covered\nbeing; the implications of contract\nfunding on research; the safety of\nnon-cost effective departments, that\nare nonetheless valued by industry,\nand the future of apolitical students\nunions for the entertainment, social\neducation and representation.\nNUS demo\nA demonstration organised by the\nNational Union of Students against\nthe Government's Education Reform\nBill was held in London last Saturday.\nA handful of Imperial students\nattended the rally in Hyde Park to\nhear speeches from NUS President\nVicky Phillips and TUC leader\nNorman Willis. Over 10,000 students\nwere reported to have attended the\nprotest from all over the United\nKingdom. Other speakers included\nJohn Griffiths, Vice Chancellor of\nManchester University and Peter\nTatchell. The NUS considered the\nevent a success.\nC&G posts Election fever grips IC\nThe papers for the City & Guilds\nUnion Executive came down on\nMonday. The only contested post is\nthat of Vice President, where the\ncandidates are Hilary Hughes (Civ\nEng 1) proposed by Kevin MacCann\n(Chem Eng 1) and Max Kallios\n(Mech Eng 1) proposed by Nigel D Baker (Chem Eng 4).\nNeil Smith (Mech Eng 2) proposed\nby Ken Pendlebury (Mech Eng 2) for\nPresident stands unopposed, after\nChris Stapleton (Aero 2) pulled out.\nAlso unopposed is Murray\nWilliamson (Mech Eng 2) standing\nfor Honorary Secretary, also\nproposed by Ken Pendlebury (Mech\nEng 2).\nThe elections will take place at a City and Guilds Union General\nMeeting next Tuesday at 1pm.

Information on\nthese posts and nomination papers are\navailable from Neil Motteram\n(External Affairs Officer)..\nYesterday the annual Imperial\nCollege Union Hustings General\nMeeting took place in the Great Hall.\nCandidates for the posts of ICU\nPresident, Deputy President,\nHonorary Secretary (Events) and\nFELIX Editor (Print Unit Manager)\nwere given 3 minutes each to\npersuade the 300-odd people present\nto vote for them. After speeches, each\ncandidate was grilled by the Elections\nCommittee using questions provided\nby the audience.\nDuring questions to the FELIX\nEditor, one of the candidates called\nquorum. Chairman Alistair Seymour\nruled that the meeting was quo rate and the candidate then went on to\nchallenge his ruling. Eventually the\nChair was handed to Recreational\nClubs Committee Chairman Neil\nMcCluskey who aske'd the candidate\nto withdraw his challenge, which he\ndid. The meeting was then able to\ncontinue.\nThe Presidential candidates were\nquestioned on a diverse range of\nsubjects including that of the recent\nUnion re-organisation.

    "content": "J VIA INI IF ES TO DEPUTY PRESIDENT Steve Mercer, proposed by Max Kallios\nThe Candidate\nMy 2 V2 years at IC have been crammed with new\nexperiences, exciting challenges and rewarding\nachievements:\nThis January saw me w res de the National Student\nRock 'n' Roll title from our very own Neil\nMcCluskey, I have trained the Ladies Rugby Team,\nD.J 'ed professionally and for ICR flown for the\nfirst time (without landing!), experienced the tedium\nof ICU Council and, was the highest single-handed\ncollector in last year's Tiddly-winks!\nExternally my activities have been equally wide:\nI help epileptics and handicapped children swim\nin safety, I am currently revitalising a National\ndrugs education organisation in conjunction with\na founding member and more recently, I am in\ndiscussion with Famine Relief over an attempt to\norganise an Nationwide event.\nThe job\nUnder the new job descriptions, a lot of the\nSabatical Officers work (with the exception of the\nFelix Editor) is still somewhat vague and so to some\nextent next years officers will be guinea-pigs trying\nout all the various complexities and intricacies of\ntheir jobs.\nAs Deputy President I would continue to be\nbasically an Administrations Manager sitting on\nevery committee in existence. But I would try to\nconcentrate more time on those College based issues\nsuch as Admissions, Academic & Welfare\nCommittees which benefit all students alike.\nI would also like to see the Union bar run like\nan ordinary public house\u2014for instance, when an\nassault is made on a publican the police are called\nand the assailant is usually banned for life and\npossibly prosecuted\u2014for the Union Bar it would\nseem that a fine is quite sufficient punishment for\nwhat has been described as high spirits and not\ncriminal intent.\nIn a brief 300 words I cannot begin to describe\nmy plans for next year if elected Deputy President\nbut I( cut at the 300th word)\nHON SECRETARY (Events) Rodger Houghton, proposed by Chris Stapleton\nThe new position of Hon Sec (Events) has the\ngreatest scope to improve the profile and social\nimage of ICU and requires imagination and a kick-ass attitude to get things done.\nAt the moment, the Union building is completely\nunderused. It needs to be turned into the focal point\nof social activity within college. The Union snack\nbar should be transformed from a place akin to an\naircraft hanger into a pub/cafe. This can be achieved\nby the use of a lowered ceiling; creative lighting\nand knocking the outside wall through with french\nwindows leading onto a lawn in Beit Quad.\nNorman's would be made into a quality pub-style\nfood outlet, catering for all tastes. The rest of the\nbuilding needs developing either by union or private\nfunds.\nLondon has an abundance of small bands as any\nreader of the gigs guide in NME will testify. These\ncould be attracted to IC on a regular basis.\nWe need more events similar to Monopoly rag\nmore frequently. More emphasis needs to be placed\non events which get money off the public instead\nof underfunded students.\nI intend to issue Union affiliation cards to the\nmany local colleges so that card holders have use\nof ICU entertainment facilities i.e. entrance to gigs,\nbars, etc. An example is Queen Alexander Hall\nwhich is literally a stones throw away from the ICU\nbuilding houses students who attend many local\ncolleges.\nThere needs to be close liaisons with the FELIX\neditor in order to promote union events, parties,\nUGMs etc.\nFinally, I am always approachable for a chat\nwhether it be in the office, bars, JCR or refectories.\nRodger Houghton.\nDo you want an Hon Sec who faces the issues or\nwho issues the faeces? Bullsh*t aside, vote\nHoughton on March 7th/8 th. Chris Stapleton.\nHON SECRETARY (Events) Ian Morris, proposed by Alan Hepper\nIan is one of the most influential people in the\nmanagement of IC Entertainments and is not afraid\nof saying what he thinks is right. It is this skill,\nalong with his excellent judgement and cheerfulness\nthat has enabled Ents to be so successful and make\nImperial one of the best venues for up and coming\nbands in London.\nWith the new job description for Honorary\nSecretary there will be changes over the\nforthcoming year which incorporate some of the\nwork of Ents. With his understanding of IC Union,\nEnts, Rag, and CCU's and major sub-committees,\nI can confidently predict that Ian Morris is the best\ncandidate for the job with determination, dedication\nand experience.\nAlan Hepper, Guilds Hon Sec.\nAs a result of the job description changes, the\nHonorary Secretary now requires relevant\nexperience in the organisation of people and\npremises, the production and distribution of\npublicity and in working with people outside\nCollege.\nIn my capacity as Entertainments Honorary\nSecretary this year and Guildsheet Editor in\n1985/86,1 have gained valuable experience in all\nthese areas and have the ability to coordinate events\nat a College-wide level.\nMy intentions are:\n1. To develop the Union Snack Bar and Lounge\nto an extent that will rival Southside.\n2. To work closely with Union officers to create\na balanced social calendar.\n3. To lias e with officers at St Marys to facilitate\nan effective merger on a social basis and to promote\ninteraction with other London colleges and\ninstitutes.\nI am not a last minute candidate. I read the new\njob descriptions seven weeks ago and decided to\nstand when they were passed at Council. Please vote\nsensibly by realising that I am the only candidate\nwith sufficient experience and enthusiasm for the\npost.\nIan Morris.\nFELIX Friday March 4th198811 "

    "content": "FOOTBA\nby Adrian Grainger\nFOOTBALL\nChem Eng Soc\n4.30am Monday morning and the\nthought of a300 mile coach journey\nwith Lonnie 'travel' to a northern\nghost town (Teeside) was hardly the\nideal start to a another Frank Morton\nsports campaign. The journey was\npredictably cold and we arrived with\nanother 22 university teams to\ncompete for the honour of being the\nbest Chem Eng team in the UK.\nWe drew Bradford in the first round\nand the terrible journey contributed\nto an even worse team performance\nand IC were lucky to win in the\nsudden death penalty shoot out (no\nthanks to Kev Graves and Russ\nDark!).\nNext round was Aston, but the pre-match beers refreshed our various\nparts and a good goal from Mark\nRadley followed by good defensive\nwork saw us through to the quarter\nfinals.\nThe draw gave us the inevitable\ngrudge match against Cambridge, but\nan aggressive performance and a goal\nfrom Kev Graves put us through to\nthe semis against Birmingham.\nBy now the crowd were turning\nagainst us (we were too well dressed,\ngood looking and successful for most\npeople's tastes) but a good goal by\nJim Wilson in his first appearance\ntook IC to the final against the\nfavourites Strathclyde.\nThe pre-match talk from Dave \"The\nJuggler' Martin inspired the IC team\nto new heights and poor Strathclyde\ndidn't stand a chance. Aggressive\nmarking and defending from\n'Chopper' Dark and two goals from\nMary Pryor and one from Jim Wilson\ngave us a well deserved victory.\nFrom a girl ie rower\nI'm sure you can imagine\nIt's as plain as it could be\nA usual Saturday rowing\nThe place ICBC\nAnother race to row today\nThe crews are all afloat\nExcept that is, the gir lies, Well\u2014they h avn' t got a boat!\nAfter week's of practice\nThe women stand and moan,\nThe reason for our boat less plight\u2014\nWe're not all 18 stone!\nSe we have no option,\nTo enable us to row,\nWe have to leave Imperial,\nAnd off to 'King's' we go!\nThere is yet another round of league\ngames with a decent selection of\nmatches for the discerning fan. All matches on Saturday 5th March, kick\noff 3pm unless otherwise stated.\nQPR vs Liverpool\nLoftus Road (White City tube)\nThose undefeated lads from the North\nventure once more into the capital, I presume that they won't lose to Derby\nin mid-week, eager to equal Leeds'\nrecord of 29 league games without\ndefeat at the start of a season. QPR\nbeat Wimbledon last week in what\nwas described as 'one hell of a boring\ngame' and that man Gavin Maguire\nmade a tackle that was so late that the\ngame was over before he got there.\nLiverpool beat Portsmouth last week\nwith a performance where they were\non par with the southerners but came\naway with all the points. Barnes\nscored both goals, making him a real\ncertainty to be made the player of the\nyear. Who can bet against Liverpool,\nbut I think that this will be a draw.\nWest Ham Utd vs Oxford Utd\nBoleyn Ground (Upton Park tube)\nThis a game between two sides in the\nmiddle to base of the league. West\nHam had a disastrous weekend last\nweek with a defeat at Derby, a one\nhour home-truths talk by Manager\nJohn Lyall, a bad injury to Liam\nBrady and constant talk about Tony\nCottee's transfer. Problems indeed\nthat must be helped by buying a new\nstriker!! Oxford lie in the bottom\nthree and unless they buck up their\nideas, I can't really see them staying\nup. Dean Saunders is proving to be\na smart man up front, but you would\nthink that Mr '\u00a3700M' Maxwell could\nbuy them some good players. If West\nHam put their act in gear then they\nshould win.\nWimbledon vs Luton Town\nPlough Lane (Wimbledon Park tube)\nThis game pits together two teams in\nthe right half of the division this time\nwith a top six place to play for.\nThe crowd should be dismal with\nneither side having what could be said\nto be decent support (9,000 only at\nWimbledon's away game at QPR last\nweek). The Dons are concentrating\nmainly on the Cup this year, but they\nmust keep their league form together\nafter a defeat last week. Luton have\nrecent England man Mick Harford in\ntheir side and with the Stein brothers\nhaving good seasons, Luton are a strong side. Wimbledon should come\nout on top but a draw is possible.\nArsenal vs Tottenham H Highbury (Arsenal tube)\nThis is the live game on TV on\nSunday. It will make a change to have\nthese two sides on TV. I mean, we\nhaven't had Liverpool, Everton, Man\nUtd, Arsenal or Spurs at all on TV\nthis year... The annual North London\nderby with pride, points and positions\nall to play for. Arsenal are at\nWembley in the Littlwoods Cup, and\ncoupled with a40 win against\nCharlton last week, things are going\nvery well for them recently. Spurs\nwon 3-0 away at Sheffield Wednesday\nlast week, but Venebles hasn't had\nthat much to cheer about this year\n(except perhaps a big pay off from\nBarcelona and a nice little earner from\nWhite Heart Lane. I have had good\nluck with my predictions of Arsenal\nwins this year and I think that this will\nbe another.\nCrystal Palace vs Oldham\nSelhurst Park (Norwood Jet BR)\nPalace let me down badly last week.\nA home defeat by struggling\nShrewsbury (admittedly on a good\nrun) is not the sort of form to expect\nfrom a promotion seeking side. \u2022\nOldham are famous as being the\n'nearly' side after their unlucky playoff defeat at the hand of Leeds last\nyear. Joe Royle is a good manager\nand they will bounce back. I think that\ntheir best player is Scot keeper Andy\nGoram. Crystal Palace should win,\nbut they don't like me so I will predict\nan away win and wait for aT on the\npools coupon.\nFulham vs Wigan\nCraven Cottage (Putney Brdg tube)\nThat old riverside ground stages a third division game. Wigan have only\nbeen in the league for ten years but\nalready have a FA Cup quarter-final\nplace and a fourth in division three\nplacing to their name. They have\nseven players on their books who\nwere born on Merseyside, I suppose\nthat playing for a side like Wigan is\na good way of getting into the\nLiverpool first team; because you\nhave no chance of breaking through\nthe ranks (sorry to Gary Ablett). A draw to be expected.\nFELIX Friday March 4th198817 "

    "content": "MUSICJazz & Rock Club Hop\nIf you weren't in the Union Lounge\nlast Saturday night, you missed eight\nCollege bands playing live. For\nseveral bands, the hop was their first\ngig ever, in fact some had yet to think\nof a name for themselves! Curmudgen\nstarted off with a cover of She Sells\nSanctuary, a song which really needs\na shouting lead singer. Unfortunately,\nthey were unable to oblige, however,\nthe rest of their set was quite well\ndone. I must confess to being\nimpressed by USSA (formerly Dark\nStar). It wasn't the fact that they had\ntwo guitarists, or even the songs they\nplayed, but the stage presence and\n'front-man' image projected by the\nvocalist, Steve Easterbrook. After\nstarting with an instrumental, (2112),\na vocalist who didn't play any\ninstruments and knew what to do on\nstage was quite a surprise. They even\nmanaged to work 'Brazilian Rain\nForests' into the lyrics (see last\nweek's FELIX). After that came\nChances, the only group to use a drum machine and to have a female\nvocalist, who accompanied James\nPapa. After starting with an Erasure\ncover version, the group managed to\nkeep many people dancing, even\nduring their slow song. Schrddinger's Cat had a quire da new guitarist since\nI last saw them, who pissed off all the\nother guitarists by out-playing them.\nUsing the stage piano was a good\nidea, as it blended nicely with the rest\nof the band. I was disappointed with\nwhat they've done to my favourite of\ntheirs, War Ain'ta Game, turning it\nfrom quite a powerful song into two\nalternating chords with a far too\nmellow sound to match the 'mud and\nslime of France' lyrics. Contact Point\nalso had a vocalist who didn't play\nany instruments, and although\nsounding a bit like Rick Astley\n(sorry), he used his voice to great\neffect in singing what I presume were\noriginal songs, of a very high\nstandard. Definitely not your average\nthrash stuff. Amongst the large\nkeyboard stack was a Moog Prodigy,\nwhich enabled them to arp egg i ate amazingly fast sequences of notes in\na way that has sadly gone out of\nfashion, save perhaps on\nIncommunicado. They were the only\nband to get an encore, which was\ngood seeing as their first number was\nbeset by technical difficulties. It was\ndefinitely worth a second hearing.\nThe Mock Ducks' lead singer knew\nhow to tw izz lea mike stand, but not\nhow to keep the audience interested.\nThe Last Emperor (Cert 15)\nBernardo Bertulucci's The Last\nEmperor is a triumph in cinematic art.\nThis beautifully crafted work tells the\ntrue story of the last emperor of\nChina. With a visual splendour and\nepic feel of a glitzy Gandhi. An epic\nin every sense of the word, it boasts\na cast of thousands, exotic locations\nand colourful period costumes. This\nabsorbing drama takes us on an\nhistorical journey through twentieth\ncentury China and although around\n2% hours long, it never seems to\ndrag.\nThe title of the film refers to Pu Yi,\nwho ascended to the Imperial throne\nof China in 1908 at the age of three.\nThree years later China became a republic and Pu Yi was made a prisoner within the walls of his own\npalace, the Forbidden City.\nThe film opens with Pu Yi as\nprisoner of Communist China in\n1950. His life story unfolds in a series\nof flashbacks and it is in the early\nscenes that the real star of the film\nemerges\u2014the Forbidden City. This\nglamorous location must be a film\nlew s director's dream, and Bertolucci\nrevels in it. Its colour and beauty are\nan awesome backdrop to the lavish\ncostumes and childhood antics of the\nemperor. The bland uniforms of the\ncommunist era serve as powerful\ncontrast when switching back and\nforth between adult and adolescent\nstages of life.\nThe film is truly a feast for the eyes,\nbut the performances must not be\noverlooked. John Lone is very good\nas the adult Pu Yi, showing naivety\nand immaturity in his character. Peter\nO 'Toole gives a memorable\nperformance playing the Emperor's eccentric Scottish tutor, maintaining\nan arrogant yet sympathetic view\ntowards the imprisoned Emperor.\nPu Yi was a man who was\nimprisoned, in one form or another\nfor most of his life, on account of his\nbirthright. Bertolucci said of him, he\nwas 'an Oriental Peter Pan floating\nlike a cork on the stream of history',\nwhich seems to sum it up. It is only\nin his final years as a gardener that\nhe can taste true freedom and grow\nup.\nThe script acts as a narrative rather\nthan an analysis on character, and\nquite rightly so. We come away with\na history lesson on twentieth century\nChina, as well as a deeper insight into\nthe culture and changing face of an\nintriguing country. But it is the\noutstanding imagery and camera work that lingers most in the mind,\nalthough I also came away with the\nquestion, how can a caged cricket\nhave survived for over 50 years?\nYou'll know what I mean when you\nsee the film.\nSumit Guha\nThey were not on stage for long.\nFinally, The Gents delivered a loud\nset of sixties cover versions which\nmade up in liveliness what they lacked\nin originality. Everyone loved them.\nI managed to get recordings of all\neight bands, which will no doubt find\ntheir way onto IC Radio between 7\nand 8 on Tuesdays. If any of the bands\nwant a copy, come down to the\nstation. I'd especially like to trade a live recording for a studio session\nrecording. We can always use our\nNorthside studios for recording\nbands.\nRichard Fincher.\nGigs\nAll About Eve\u20144/5th March,\nAstoria, \u00a35.\nThe Fa//-18th March,\nHammersmith Odeon, \u00a37.\nThe Mission\u201421st/27 th March,\nAstoria, \u00a37.\nThe Larks & Young Blood\nDingwalls, Fri 26th Feb\nSupport act Young Blood have got a lot to learn before they start pulling\na regular crowd. After the second\nsong, I watched the rest of the set\nfrom the bar. Their songs are slightly\nreminiscent of the early Jam but\nwithout that special chemistry of the\nJam. Keep at it Young Blood, you can\nonly get better.\nThe Larks on the other hand are a pleasure to review. From the moment\nthey stepped on stage\u2014WHAM! The\npower, energy and vitality overwhelm\nyou as they and the audience get\nwilder and wilder, with non-stop\ndancing all through their show. Each\nsong shows an original sound from\nfuzz guitar, to a tight ry th mn section,\npulsating with the punchy sounds of\nan exciting brass ensemble. They\nmake it look so easy and they make\nit sound like there's a whole orchestra\non stage (in fact there are only six of\nthem).\nTheir music is out on its own\ncompared to the current trend of\ngre bos, goths, psych adel ics, hip-hop,\netc, which probably means that they\nmight have a harder time trying to get\nsomewhere. When they do, however\nthey are likely to be around a lot\nlonger.\nAssociations with the group\nMadness immediately spring to mind,\nbut are unfair and superficial as The\nLarks show a fresher appealing\nsound, with more texture and\ncoolness to their music.\nWhy the floor boards of the Union\nHall haven't creaked to the sound of\nthis band remains somewhat a puzzle,\nbut judging by the packed, happy,\ndancing crowd of students at\nDingwalls I'm sure they'd have no\nproblem filling it.\nJohn Blank\nFELIX Friday March 4th198815 "

    "content": "MANIFESTO\nPlaying by the rules\nIC Union is more progressive and up-to-date than the British Parliament.\nThis may come as a shock, but as far\nas elections are concerned it is quite\ntrue. The reason for this is the use of\nthe Single Transferable Vote (STV)\nsystem of making and counting ballot\npapers. This system is slightly more\ncomplicated than the first past the post\nsystem but is thought by many to be\nmuch fairer. It allows you to express\nsecond or third preferences if you so\nwish.\nThis year's elections\nand how to vote\nThis year there are four elections.\nTwo of these have two candidates and\ntwo of them have three candidates. In\neither case, your first preference will\nbe marked with a one (1).\nCandidate A Candidate B1 Candidate X Candidate Y1 Candidate Z If you don't want to express a preference for any more than one\ncandidate, that is how to do it. If you\nwish to express a second preference,\nor second and third preferences, you\nare free to do so.\nCandidate A2 Candidate Bf Candidate XI Candidate Y3 Candidate Z2. You are free to express as many levels\nof preference as you wish, but the\nnumbers you put down must be in\nnumerical sequence, ie you can't express first and third preferences\nwithout a second preference.\nBut what does this all mean?\nThe main crux of the STV system is\nthat to win, a candidate has to pass\n'quota'. In the first count, 'quota' is\nthe number of valid ballot papers,\ndivided by two, plus one, ie for 935\npapers, quota will be 469. If a candidate passes quota on first count,\nmy job is made much easier as they\nare elected. If not, the candidate with\nthe lowest number of first preferences\nwill drop out. Any second preferences\nindicated on that candidate's first\npreference papers will then remain as\nvalid papers and will be divided\namongst the remaining candidates as\nper the second preference expressed.\nAny first preference papers for this\ncandidate which do not contain a second preference will be discounted\nfrom the second count. This means\nthat 'quota' will change if this is the\ncase. The easiest way to explain this\nis by a hypothetical example.\nFirst count Second count\nCandidate X402493(402+91) win\nCandidate Y327387(327+60) Candidate Z206 Total\nQuota\n935\n469 441\nThe final preference is so that in the\ncase of two remaining candidates\ntying, the issue can be decided by the\nfinal count.\nAbstentions\nIf you do not think that any of the\ncandidates are of sufficient calibre,\nyou can register an abstention. The\nway to do this is to write 'ABSTAIN'\nacross the ballot paper. This is the\nonly accepted spelling and any other\nspelling will be a spoilt paper. An\nabstention is not a wasted vote and is\nquite different from simply not\nvoting. If the number of abstentions\nrecorded is greater than the total votes\ncast, the election must be re-run from\nthe very start, ie from the stage of\npapers up.\nSummary\n1. Vote in order of preference number\n1. 2, 3.\n2. Abstain by writing 'ABSTAIN'\nacross the paper.\n3. Do not write anything other than\nthat explained above.\n4. Remember to bring your Union\ncard.\nValid papers\nCandidate A Candidate B/ Candidate X3 Candidate Yr Candidate Zz Candidate A Candidate B Spoilt papers\nCandidate A X Candidate B Candidate X3 Candidate Yi Candidate Z Candidate \u00a3 l.

    "content": "UNDER J THE MICRO a& j SCOPE by Steve Black\nCreationism:\nscience or\nsuperstition?\nJust over a week ago (Thursday 25th February) a creationist gave a talk at\nImperial College. Creationists reject\nthe theory of evolution and many also\nreject the idea that the earth is billions\nof years old. Usually the scientific\nestablishment rejects such ideas\noutright by abusing them as anti-science and refusing them a hearing.\nSuch an attitude is wrong.\nCreationists are convinced that\nthere is a conspiracy to prevent them\nairing their views in public. They are\nindignant about this, because they are\nalso convinced that their views can be\ndefended scientifically. Any response\nthat refuses them a forum for debate\nonly confirms their suspicions.\nI will come back to a few of the\ndetails of their ideas later, but first it\nis worth examining their conspiracy\ntheory. The creationist movement is\nbig in the American Bible Belt. But,\nrather than countering its popularity\nin open debate, the scientific\nestablishment there has tried to\nsuppress it. Over here, mainstream\nbiologists and geologists tend to\nprefer the path of ignoring creationists\nin the hope they will go away. This\nis not so much conspiracy as\ncomplacency.\nOn the other hand, scientists can be\nnotoriously bigoted in defending\nestablished views. The most clear-cut\ncase of this concerns the way\nImmanuel Velikovsky was treated\nwhen he wanted to publish his\neccentric views on Earth history and\nvarious catastrophes therein (he was\nnot actually a creationist, just a run\nof the mill weirdo). Instead of\nallowing him to publish his ideas and\nthen subjecting them to critical\nappraisal, the establishment\nsuppressed them (publishers pulled\nout of deals at the last minute, and so\non). The ideas gained considerable\nappeal just because they had been\nsuppressed: nothing convinces a believer more than an apparent\nconspiracy against his ideas. The\nsame applies to the creationist\nmovement: the more they are\nignored, the more the supporters\nbecome convinced of their own\nTightness.\nBoth complacency and\nestablishment bigotry do immense\ndamage to the cause of science. The\nbest way to deal with silly ideas is to\nhold them up for critical examination.\nCreationists and the like should be\nallowed to publish their views (if they\ncan express them scientifically) and\nthose who disagree can then point out,\nquietly, rationally and without\nemotion, where they went wrong.\nOther people can then make up their\nown minds on the basis of the\nevidence. One of the reasons for the\nsuccess of creationism is that its\nadherents are not exposed to calm and\nrational rebuttals of their beliefs.\nGiving them a platform to express\ntheir view in the context of open\ndebate is one way to get those\nsupporters out of the ghetto.\nIn science the establishment is often\nwrong, and attempts to keep out\ncontrary opinions can often result in\nimportant new ideas being was tef tilly ignored. Branches of science advance\nquickest when they are open to new\nideas: lots of silly new ideas will get\npublished, but the process of criticism\nthen provokes new insights that\nadvance the whole field.\nCreationists are very good at\nspotting anomalies in theories they\ndon't like. For example, Evolution\nsuggests that all life evolved from a common ancestor, but the fossil\nrecord stubbornly refuses to yield\nimportant transitional forms. Even the\nclassic demonstrations of continuous\nevolution (such as the evolution of the\nmodern horse) are open to severe\ncriticism. However, there is little\npoint in defending over-simplistic\npresentations of the evidence for\nevolution. A lot of the text-book case\nstudies are rubbish and are used more\nfor their persuasive power than their\naccuracy. It may well be that we\nshould never have expected any\ndegree of completeness in the fossil\nrecord, but popular books are\nunwilling to admit this and often tend\nto iron over the gaps and make the\nrecord look better than it is.\nCreationists have been quick to point\nout such dubious practices. We should\nnot be too embarrassed when these\nstraw men are knocked down: they\nonly get in the way of good science.\nGood scientists should be capable\nof making up their own minds on the\nbasis of actual evidence. An attitude\nof constructive criticism of the\nconventional wisdom should be\nencouraged, otherwise their branch of\nscience will fossilize. Listening to\nwhat the creationists say can be a helpful part of this process: they are\ncapable of spotting an anomaly in\nconventional science a mile off.\nTrying to face their criticisms (rather\nthan just ignoring them) would do\nsome areas of science a lot of good,\nand would create the sort of critical\nbut constructive minds that all areas\nof science need.\nWhere creationists go seriously\nwrong is in their attempt to build an\nalternative theory of earth history on\nthe basis of the holes in the\nconventional one. No theory is\nperfect. Indeed, it is the holes that\nkeep science in business. Serious\ndoubt is only worthwhile when a lot\nof big holes stubbornly resist being\nfilled in. Evolution has been\nextremely successful at filling in the\nbig holes in the history of life, but\nthere are still a lot of smaller holes\nwaiting to be looked at. We should\nnot be frightened of looking at them\nourselves, nor should we exclude\nthose who point them out.\nThe major argument for refusing to\ndebate with creationists (their beliefs\nare religious and hence beyond the\nrealm of science) is actually a bit of\na red herring. Many establishment\nscientists have pretty funny religious\nviews, but we don't exclude them\nfrom mainstream science. Anyway,\nmany scientists get far too 'religious'\nabout their science. They act as\nthough science could solve the\nworld's problems (as though the\nworld is in a mess just because people\nrefuse to think rationally about it).\nThey defend their beliefs in a wholly\nirrational manner. They refuse to\nconsider alternative theories and do\ntheir best to exclude awkward facts.\nThese are all signs of the sort of\nreligious insecurity creationists are\nsupposed to be guilty of. But they are\ntypical human traits, and appear\nwhenever anyone gets too committed\nto any set of beliefs, religious or not.\nWe all prefer to see just what we\nwant to see. Beating this urge is an\nimportant part of being a good\nscientist.\n6 Friday March 4th1988 FELIX\n\n"

I do think it can be\nanti-Howgate (oops no! Sydney Harbour-Bridge now!! I keep forgetting) but that is your opinion and as you keep\npointing out, the editorial is for you to air your opinion!\nMy advice to everyone out there is\u2014go to the FELIX\nOffice, speak to Judith (she doesn't bite! Well, don't go\ntoo near her, especially if you're wearing a hat and your\nhair is flat underneath), and write the kind of article you\nwould like to see in FELIX. A bit more productive than\njust bitching, don't you think?\nLove and kisses,\nJames Papa, Mech Eng 2.\nShocked & surprised\nDear Judith,\nAs the Editor of the 1988-1989 PG Prospectus, it was\nwith great surprise that I read the letter from Mr T Spencer\nin last week's edition of FELIX (No 795).\nIn his letter Mr Spencer states that the Print Unit had\n'botched' the job of producing the cover of the prospectus.\nI would like to point out to all who may be interested that\ndespite an initial hiccup, the Print Unit produced, at\nextremely low cost, a splendid cover, as indeed they did\nthe rest of the booklet. I am sure anyone who reads this\nyear's PG Prospectus will agree with me.\nAlan Barnett, PG Prospectus Editor.\nPompous ****\u2014a better title than\n'Print Unit Trouble'?\nDear Judith,\nWe refer to our letter of last week, printed under the\ntitle 'Print Unit Trouble'. We felt it represented a legitimate complaint over a bill we received for printing\nwhich was so unsatisfactory as to be of no use.\nInstead of being receptive to the complaint and\nattempting to redress the balance, FELIX, as usual, turned\ndefensive in the face of a perfectly reasonably criticism.\nThe excuses that were printed in your reply were, frankly,\noffensive.\nMopsoc and Astrosoc have now ceased to be\nsympathetic to the Print Unit's difficulties. If you could\nnot provide the service you claimed to offer, you should\nnot have accepted the order in the first place. The entire\nsob story about how pressed you were is of no interest\nto your diss at is if ed customers.\nAnd no wonder we are dissatisfied. How are we\nsupposed to believe your excuses for charging us twice\nthe estimate when, a paragraph later, you sum up by saying\nyou would charge us double given the chance? And why?\nFor wasting the Print Unit's time! I think you'll find it\nwas our time, and money, that was wasted because you\ntook an order that you were clearly incapable of carrying\nout. And you also wasted the time of your own Business\nManager, Chris Martin, when he went needlessly debt\ncollecting after you had failed to inform him that the goods\nhad not been delivered. The apology he seeks is not from\nus.\nIndeed, why should we apologise at all? We made a perfectly reasonable request of the Print Unit and in return\nhave received nothing but trouble. I understand,\nfurthermore, that we are not alone in this and that is why\nI feel our letter is of interest to others. Others, that is,\nwho would not dare criticise the Print Unit Manager for\nfear that she would withdraw those services that FELIX\ndoes have a monopoly over.\nIf any apology is to be made, it is to RCSU, for we\nhave wasted its money attempting to enlist the services\nof an unreliable Print Unit instead of spending more and\ngoing elsewhere.\nIn future we will do so. You have done nothing but\ncreate bad feeling with your attitude that the customer does\nnot matter. We remain highly unsatisfied with the\ntreatment we have received.\nDan Salmons, Mopsoc President,\nNick Wood, Astrosoc Chairman.\nComplete satisfaction\nDear Miss Hackney,\nRecently, The Penthouse Club had cause to require the\nPrint Unit to provide us with some business cards.\nUnfortunately, we feel quite unable to start a long-running\ncontroversy in the letter's column of that esteemed\npublication, FELIX, because we were entirely satisfied\nwith the work.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Penthouse Club.\n(names supplied, but couldn't read all of them).\nRCSU Honorary Sexy\nshocker!\nDear Judith,\nWhat a con these RCS Hon Sees are! Last Friday night,\nwe had just returned from a long night's sharking and were\njust about to go to bed.\nImagine my surprise when I heard a loud thumping at\nour front door. Talk about the power of advertising! When\nI opened the front door, who should be standing outside\nbut Gordon Brignall himself! Without any further\nprompting he launched into the classic KGB 'guess what?\nI'm going to search your flat' mode and stormed the\nstronghold of his arch-enemy Dai Rocking. We felt this\nwas a little unwise as Dai shares a room with Mike 'insane\naxe-wielding psychopath' Evans who is a part-time insane\naxe-wielding psychopath, and doesn't really like being\nwoken at 3am by a 'where are my trousers you bastard'\ntype interrogation.\nApparently Gordon was so eager to converse with our\nalcohol sampling member that he had crossed London on\na stolen three-seater bicycle, presumably also in stolen\ntrousers.\nLuckily, we saw the funny side of it and threw him out\nof the flat.\nThe Penthouse Club.\nFELIX Friday March 4th198819 "

Yes, you, Miss Judith\nLargeamounts of Sel spock Dormitory, Cheapskate, could win \u00a3100,000.

'I need someone to write me a nice\nfan letter.' She looked around the office, but couldn't see anyone so she called\nto her two loyal slaves in the print room, 'hey, you two, stop s noggin g and\ncome and write me some fan mail'.\nAfter a few minutes thinking, an acceptable letter had been conceived:\nDear Judith,\nYou are great and so is Phallix and the print shop. If people want smiling,\njovial staff then they shouldn't come here 'cos we'll just tell them to piss off\nand leave us alone.\nYours obediently,\nA Slave.\n'That's better\u2014a lovely fan letter\u2014we'll publish that'. Largeamounts breathed\na sign of relief and threw the nasty letters in the bin.\nJust then Mr PK Spin-drive-crash-burn of the Mayfair Club arrived to place\nhis usual quota of silly small ads. He also had a fan letter for Largeamounts:\nDear Largeamounts,\nWe, the Mayfair Club, had some cards printed by you and they were great.\nYours lustfully,\nThe Mayfair Club.\nPS.

Regrettably, all too often,\nI find that it's another circular or\nminutes of a committee meeting. I am\ntherefore always pleased to see an\ninvoice from FELIX; the excitement\ncan be almost too much to bear! This\nyear, you have excelled yourself\u2014\nso many bills, so much paperwork!\nYou deserve Social Colours for such\ndedication!\nHowever, on this occasion, I fear\nyour desire to please has led to a desperate situation where this invoice\nhas already been paid.

    "content": "MANIFESTOS\nFELIX EDITOR Bill Goodwin, proposed by Dave Burns\nIf I didn't think Bill was the best person for the\npost of Felix editor, I wouldn't propose him. So,\nwhy should you vote for him? Simple; Bill has\nworked on Felix since his first year, being involved\nas news editor and in writing features. He was also\nthe editor of the best C&G handbook 'Spanner'\never to see the light of day and has had articles\npublished in the New Scientist. In addition he has\nbeen a regular contributor to Guildsheet and Mines\nnewsletter.\nBeing a successful editor is not just a matter of\ntechnical production of Felix and the running of\nthe Print Unit, it depends heavily on the editor's personality. Bill gets on well with people and would\nmake everyone welcome in the office. Most\nimportantly he takes pains to research his material\nproperly and accurately.\nDave Burns.\nNews\nI will establish a news and photographic team to\ncover college, club, sporting and CCU events in\nan accurate and unbiased way. Having spent two\nyears working on the news side of FELIX, I am\nthe candidate best able to carry this out.\nFeatures\nThere will be a regular music page, surveys,\npuzzles, in-depth investigations and more clubs\nfeatures. I will encourage anyone with strong views\non any subject to write opinion articles.\nEvent\nThere will be a \"what's on\" featuring events in\nother London colleges and ULU as well as Imperial.\nHumour\nNext year's FELIX will contain cartoons, satire and\na humour page directed towards all students, not\njust cliques.\nPrint Unit\nI will ensure that priority is given to union work\nand FELIX. I would like to see FELIX receiving\nmore support from advertising.\nBill Goodwin.\nFELIX EDITOR Chris Martin, proposed by Liz Holford\nA FELIX Editor has to manage as well as be\ncreative. After seeing Chris running IC Radio, ICU\nPublications Board and working for two years on\nFELIX, I am sure he is the best candidate for\nFELIX Editor. I urge you to vote for him.\nLiz Holford, Phoenix Editor.\nEvery year, candidates tell you what is going to\nbe different about their FELIX: better news, more\nhumour etc etc\u2014and yet little changes. Why?\nSimply because the Editor finds that they cannot\nget together with a few friends and produce the\nFELIX they promised. They may not have the\nexperience or skills needed, and can't( or won't) encourage others to help.\nA good FELIX Editor needs experience in two\nkey areas:\nFirstly, as an organiser; someone who can\nencourage students to become involved, and then\nkeep them interested. The ideal FELIX Editor\nwrites nothing in the paper, they just make it\npossible for every student to make their own\ncontribution. I am the only candidate to have this\nkind of experience; I did it when I was in charge\nof IC Radio and I know how to motivate and keep\ninterest high.\nSecondly, as an expert; someone who knows how\nall the equipment works, knows all the\ntechniques\u2014everything from writing to design,\nfrom paste-up to printing, and who is willing to\nshare this expertise. Again I am the only candidate\nwith any experience of how the Print Unit works\nand, surprisingly, the only candidate to do regular\nproduction work on FELIX.\nWith a large enthusiastic staff, the old problems\ndisappear: FELIX won't be clique y and boring,\nsimply because of the number of contributors.\nFELIX will no longer pursue vendettas, but become\nthe voice of the students!\nOpen FELIX up to the students next year.. .vote\nChris Martin 1.\nFELIX EDITOR Martyn Peck, proposed by Sumeet Ghaie\nMartyn is a candidate that many would love to\nignore. His infuriatingly optimistic attitude tends\nto get up everyone's left nostril. Yet in only five\nmonths he has \"hack\"ed his way into IC Radio\n(Treasurer), Felix (Advertising Manager), Rag\n(Publicity Officer), Rock Soc (Chairman) and\nBean's Club (General Dogsbody). He will also be\nediting next year's Alternative Prospectus.\nMartyn is obviously capable of giving this post\nthe dedication it deserves.\nSumeet Ghaie\nA***** of things to ****,\nSome people think I'm a****, but that's an ***\n*** ***** remark.

With the\nCheltenham Festival, the National,\nand the 1000 and 2000 Guineas\ncoming up, it's now that trainers start\ntesting the field with a few\npreliminary races before the classics\nstart looming. Last weekend was no\nexception.\nThere was more funny business\nfrom David Elseworth's stable when\nRhyme n' Reason won the Racing\nPost Handicap Chase. He left top\nweight Desert Orchid in at the\novernight stage and declared him as\na non-runner in the morning. This left\nRhyme n' Reason only carrying lOst\n1 lib instead of a stone heavier had\nDesert Orchid run. Putting this down\nto an administrative cock-up,\nElseworth's reaction was that his\nhorse would have won anyway. He\nnow has an appointment with the\nJockey Club this week to explain his\nactions. This should prove interesting\nas he is already in deep water over\nstill unresolved doping allegations\nsurrounding Cavvies Clown. His\nchance of getting off with no more\nthan a slap on the wrist? I 'll lay 2-1\nthe field. Rhyme n' Reason is now\n16-1 for the National and the same\nprice for Cheltenham. He's quoted at\n200-1 for the double.\nWith an excellent St Patrick's Day\nmeeting at Leopardstown promised to\nrival the Gold Cup, Carvils Hill looks\nto be the horse to beat. Rated as the\nbest prospect Ireland has produced\nsince sadly-missed Dawn Run, trainer\nJim Dreaper has plans for his horse\nwith Leopardstown/Fairyhouse/\nBritish treble.\nLooking to this Saturday, Midnight\nCount, who has not raced for some\n14 months due to injury, is now set\nto make his comeback. Josh Gifford\nhas declared him for the Timeform\nChase at Haydock.\nRomford dogs on Saturday sees the\nopening three heats of the Sporting\nLife Marathon. This is one of the\nmajor events in the greyhound year.\nThe final is next Wednesday with an\nexcellent programme lined up\nincluding the Sporting Life Maxi\nMarathon, a1100m race\u2014the longest\nallowed under National Greyhound\nRacing Club rules.\nThis week's winners appear in the\nnews pages.\nRunrig\nForget Big Country, forget Simple\nMinds and forget those Eddie\nEdwards lookalikes the Proclaimers,\nthe Scottish band are Runrig, playing\ntheir first major London gig tonight\nat the Town and Country Club,\nKentish Town.\nThe six piece band from the west\nMUSKL\ncoast are absolute mega stars in\nScotland and are deservedly on the\nedge of breaking through in England.\nThe mainly Gaelic lyrics on the\nearly alu bums Recovery and\nHeartland are being replaced by\nEnglish to the extent that the new\nalbum contains only two Gaelic tracks\nincluding the brilliantly rousing Alba\n(meaning 'Scotland'). Protect and\nSurvive, which is normally dedicated\nto 'all those who think that nuclear\nwar is remotely acceptable', is a meditation on life, and the sheer\nfutility of war.\nThe highland melodies and lyrics\ndenouncing absentee landlords and\nwhat they see as a foreign government\nguarantee a rapturous reception at\nhome. The mainly Scottish audience\nwill undoubtedly love it, but don't be\nput off if, like me, you're as as san ach. Runrig have something for everyone.\nTickets are \u00a35 and it's probably worth\nchecking for availability first on 267\n3334.\nby Phil Young\nOne of the grooviest bands around\nwill appear at the Astoria tonight and\ntomorrow in the shape of All About\nEve. Don't be put off by the single\nWild Hearted Woman which must be\ntheir most drab yet. They play a blinder live. Support comes from\nSomething Happens who have\nachieved some fame from supporting\nThe Alarm. This week has its\nspattering of the usual indie sounds,\nmost notably the Milk Monitors at the\nClarendon, Mighty Mighty at the\nTunnel, and finally The Men They\nCouldn't Hang at Thames Poly, all\ntonight. The Flag in North Wembley\nhas traditionally been the centre of the\nuniverse for Numanoids, and this will\nbe the weekend of the year as Gary\nNuman himself appears both tonight\nand tomorrow. For anyone feeling\nrich, Heart are delivering their pop-metal at Wembley Arena on Saturday,\nand on Sunday a band who need no\nintroduction, the delightful Zodiac\nMindwarp and the Love Reaction, hit\nHammersmith Odeon.\n14 Friday March 4th1988 FELIX\n\n"

They\nshow the utter desperation and\nhopelessness of their situation. Why\nelse would women and youths, some\nnot even in their teens, take on the\nmight of the Israeli Army?\nIt is a known fact that the living\nconditions in these camps are\nsubhuman. The Palestinians are\ntreated as second class citizens in their\nbirthplace. They live in shanty towns\nwith usually no electricity, water\nsupplies or waste disposal systems.\nTo make matters worse they see new\nluxurious Israeli settlements springing\nup all over the occupied territories\nshowing that Israel has no intention\nof leaving these territories.\nIt should come as no shock that the\nPalestinians protest. It should be\nremembered that these protests started\nbecause an Israeli Army truck overran\nfour Palestinian youths. What is\nsurprising though is the excessive\namount of force being used in the\nIsraeli Army in putting down these\nprotests. It seems that all this world\ncriticism has had no effect on their\ntactics. They were already using live\nammunition and now they have\nresorted to dum dum bullets,\nin desc rim in ate beatings and the use of\na special tear gas which causes\nabortion to install fear into the\nPalestinian people. Not to mention\ncases such as the burying alive of\nthree Palestinians with a bulldozer\nand the pounding with rocks of certain\nprotesters by soldiers. As if that\nweren't enough even Israeli civilians\nwho are freely allowed to carry\nfirearms join in the shooting down of\nthese protesters. So far 72\nPalestinians have died and hundreds\nhave been seriously injured in this\nuprising.\nThe Israeli Knesset says it has no\nchoice. It wants to solve the problem\nbut first these protests must be put\ndown. What was preventing them\nfrom solving the problems in the last\n30 years? They say they don't know\nwho to talk to. When the PLO is\nmentioned they say it is just a terrorist\norganisation. They forget that they\nthemselves were regarded as terrorists\nnot too long ago. It seems that they\nwant to avoid the issue. They even say\nthat the soldiers only shoot when their\nlife is in danger and that they don't use force unless it is necessary but the\nTV pictures show the contrary.\nThe Israeli Knesset is supposed to\nbe the representative of the Israeli\npeople, people who have suffered\ngreat atrocities during the Second\nWorld War. They of all people should\nunderstand the sufferings of the\nPalestinian people.\nI couldn't but help notice that in\nFELIX (26.2.88) the Jewish Soc has\nasked for support on humanitarian\ngrounds for Alex Paberezchensky\nwho has been asked to join the\nRussian military which will cause the\nRussians to refuse him an exit visa for\n20.years. They on the other hand were\nvery active in opposing the motion put\nout on the same humanitarian grounds\nfor condemning by the Union the\nheavy-handedness of the Israeli Army\nin putting down these protests.\nUndoubtedly the Palestinians are\nsuffering under the present situation\nbut it is not only a Palestinian\nproblem. It is a problem for all\nhumanitarian and conscience bearing\npeople to solve.\nSyed Irshad Akhtar, Elec Eng II.\nTODAY!

    "content": "ori: FOOTBALL\nJinking good show!\nIC II\u20144\nNew College II\u20141\nThe invincible 2nds march on!\nAnother game, another two points\nadded to their impressive total for this\nseason. Captain Russ Dark won the\ntoss, and IC kicked off. They didn't have to wait long before the\ninevitable. Alan Galss beat the New\nCollege defence with a j in king, solo\nrun, slid the ball inside for Pip Peel\nto convert the first goal. A second was\nsoon added by Alan Glass, who's cool\nhead has enabled him to score so\nmany this season. After the switch,\nNew College pulled one back, after\nStuart Miller was b latent ly pushed off\nthe ball. Despite this, IC continued to\ndominate in a game that, for the\ndefence, was as interesting as a1 st team match report! Mickey\nPlummer's probing runs, Chris\nBurton's shivering due to the cold,\nPaul Thompson's mouth and Guy\nPhiri's off sides all helped to produced\nas many talking points as a night out\nwith the 4th team! Eventually Pip Peel\ngot his second and IC's third goal, to\nease any worries about dropping\npoints. This was rounded off to four\nwhen Alan Glass was on target,\nshortly after the final whistle went,\nwithout any mention of 'Billy the\nFish' Allen, or Eddy the Eagle. A special mention to Rakesh Muthoo,\nwho was stupid enough to take a cold\nshower after the game. After this win,\nIC can look forward to a piece of\nsilverware at the end of the season,\nin the shape of the league title.\nNo Jon, me no speak French\nIC V vs LSE IV\nLSE turned up very late, and quite\nfrankly need n't have bothered. With\nonly eight players, LSE were always\ngoing to struggle, and if it wasn't for\nthe fact that IC's play was abysmal,\nthe game could quite easily have\ndeteriorated to a one-side farce. For\nfifteen minutes IC made such a big\ndeal out of getting past seven\ndefenders that tempers became frail.\nLuckily Lee Roberts kept his head\nwhilst all those around him were\nscreaming theirs' off, and confidently\nstroked the opener from a tight angle.\nTwo minutes later, John Bolger\ntrampled all over an LSE defender,\nand Bas.Basma took advantage with\na simple tap-in. 'We should get a dozen against this lot' commented\nGlenn Evans....ten seconds later,\nLSE pulled one back. Their centre\nhalf ran through Jon Turner, sidestepped several tackles, and slipped\nthe ball past Steve Von Bargen who\nwas busy inspecting the grass at the\ntime to notice. Everyone started\nswearing at each other. All of it was\nunprintable. A few minutes later a cross from the right eluded everyone\nexcept Lee, who made the volley look\neasy. 3-1. Deja-vous two minutes\nlater, and this time Bas made the tap-in look difficult, but luckily the\ngoalkeeper dived out of the way. 4-1.\nHalf-time, and Rob Kay and Alan\nGelder (two newcomers) gave the rest\nof the team a rollicking for playing\nso appallingly. 'But we're always this\ncrap' is the muttered reply. Paul\nCauldwell was replaced by Francis\nShupo, making his debut. More\nrubbish from IC led to more shouting,\n(except from Bah Tamanji, who's only comment was 'No, Jon, me no\nplay sub'), until Bas hit a snap shot\nfrom twenty yards for his hattrick.\n5-1. Jon actually entered the\nopposition's penalty area for the first\ntime this season, but whilst the LSE\ndefence were poo ing themselves\nabout the presence of his hunk y masculine frame, Francis slid in the\ncorner with a stupendous volley. 6-1.\nLADIES RUGBY REUNION EVENING\nAny ladies who were and are still\ninterested in ladies rugby. We are\nhaving a social evening on Friday\n18th March. Followed by a rugby\nmatch on Saturday 19th March.\nIf you are interested in coming\nalong, please contact Kathy\nTait-IC Union/Fiona Nicholas\u2014\nRCS Union Office.\nBADMINTON Victory over old rivals\nLondon Colleges Knockout Cup\nImperial College reached the final of\nthis even for the second time in three\nyears by having straight forward wins\nagainst Mary's, St George's and\nGuy's Hospital. In the final IC were\nfaced by their old rivals, UCL.\nFirst blood went to IC in the men's doubles with a convincing win by\nSean Mulshaw and Simon Hughes\nover the UCL second pair. This was\nshort lived however when the UCL\nfirst pair dominated both their rubbers\nto give them an early edge.\nIn the mixed doubles UCL played\nvery well against three strong IC\ncombinations. Sean and Julie\nGoodeve to claw their way to win\nover three games, 4-15, 18-17, 15-9.\nOnce more UCL fought back to defeat\nJulie, this time playing with Bharat\nPopat, again over three tight games\nto give them victory in the mixed,\n2-1.\nIn the singles Trevor Kevmick had\nWasps stung\nImperial College 1st XV\u201414\nWasps 3rd XV3 Tries: Quirk, Jenkins and Smith\nOoh no! The Boys have done it again!\nAfter a spirited performance in midweek against the Met Police, when IC\nstruggled through to win by 13-4, the\nRugby Club continued to maintain its\nstranglehold on the almost 1st class\nrugby scene by beating Wasps 3rd XV by a goal and two tries to a penalty (14-3).\nDespite having some regular\nsecond team players in their pack,\nWasps were unable to dominate. As\nthe opposition's initial pressure\nsubsided, the IC backs showed the\nLoose ladies\nIC vs Southampton\nLast weekend, in very little wind, IC\nsailed against Southampton (regarded\nas the best university sailing team).\nIn the morning races, IC still tired\nafter travelling for over two hours,\nwere narrowly beaten by the men's team. After lunch IC sailed against the\nladies team who had a rather loose\ninterpretation of the rules. Despite\nthis IC won the first race, and were\nleading the second race, until Ape\nproved that he is in a different class\nto everyone else by sailing a different\ncourse. Final score versus the ladies\nan impressive victory. Despite losing\nthe first end he eventually got his\nopponent on the run, and from then\non it was just a matter of playing the\nsteady, consistent badminton we have\ncome to expect from him.\nIn the ladies doubles Julie, playing\nwith Uta Boltse set the standard with\na1516,152 victory. This was\nfollowed by further wins, equally\nconvincing in nature, by Uta and\nSarah Threadgold, and then Sarah and\nJo Cohen. The last of these made IC\nchampions by a margin of 7-4\nThree Imperial College players\nreceived honours at this year's British\nUniversities Championships, while\nplaying for London University. Julie\nGoodeve won a silver medal in the\nmixed doubles (playing with Paul\nWalden of London Vets) and Sean\nMulshaw and Simon Hughes received\nbronze medals for reaching the semifinals of the men's doubles.\nRUGBY way forward with a simple but\neffective move, leaving J Quirk to\ndrive through a weak defense for a try\nby the posts.\nAfter the break Wasps tried to\nattack again, but their heads soon\ndropped. A20 yard break from Andy\nWatson, followed by a delicate chip\ninto touch gave IC a line out near the\nWasp's try line: Greensmith palmed\nto Jenkins, on the burst, who drove\nover from a full 60 inches. Simon\nSmith ended a good game with a driving try in the corner and an\n'almost try' by 'Roboprop' (Peter\nDrew) just about wound up a convincing victory.\nSAILING\nwas one all.\nThe next set of races were against\nthe men's team again, this time IC\nbeat them to make it a tie overall.\nFor the deciding race the venue was\nchanged to Southampton Docks. After\nan encounter with a frigate, where\nSam lost her bottle (twice!), the pace\nreally hot ted up and Sam and Bill\nwere unable to finish. At this point\nthere were signs of a Southampton\nwin, but Richard stole it from them\nto give IC a win before the long trek\nhome.\n16 Friday March 4th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Teams of two\nattempted to travel between London\nand Paris in the shortest time possible.\nVarious forms of transport were\nemployed by the resourceful students\nas means to the end.\nThe most daring and advert u rous method is the traditional travel form,\nhitch-hiking. Not satisfied by merely\n'thumbing a lift' the participants\nincreased their lift chances and the\npotential for collecting cash in the\nboxes provided, by dressing up, the\ncommon themes being evening wear\nDear friends\u2014if you're thinking of coming to see us on the\nabove date, please cut out the dragon below and hand it\nin at the door, this ensures that we get some money rather\nthan it all going to the Greyhound!

As\nstated above, collecting boxes and\nRag Mags were also taken by those\nwho could, to increase revenue.\nThe planning of the event was\ncommendable, with check out/check\nin points manned extensively. Each\nparticipant had a list of cheap\naccommodation in Paris, a French\nroad map and an inter-city map of\nParis. Also available were cheap fares\nkindly provided by Sealink UK Ltd.\nThe most original method of travel to\nParis has to be the three intrepid\nexplorers who cycled the whole\ndistance to Paris. This is no mean feat\nfor those who have little experience\nof long distance cycling, and who had\nto borrow bicycles. Though they\narrived later than the other\ncompetitors their contribution was\nessential to the event.\nOn Saturday evening, the Mary's contingent in Paris took over the\nbasement of a restaurant and\nproceeded to have a merry evening\nwith much eating, drinking and\nsinging of traditional Mary's songs.\nSuch a fine sight that must be repeated\nnext year.\nInitial projections indicate that this\nevent alone will raise over \u00a32,000 for\nthe charity concerned.

    "content": "s Part Two Have you ever\nnoticed that when a person enters the\ncompany of a member of the\nopposite sex,\ncertain changes take\nplace in the\nappearance of both\npeople? Men no\nlonger slouch but\npull their stomachs\nin, their chests\nprotrude and their\neyes begin to\nsparkle. Women\nassume an erect\nposture and push\ntheir breasts out.\nBoth people lose\nthe bagging around\ntheir faces and to\nthe casual observer,\nthey both become\nmore youthful in\nappearance.\nWhile these movements are studied\nand deliberate, others are completely\nunconsciously done. Again these\nmovements indicate that man is just\nanother animal. Just like a male bird,\na man can preen and make sexually\naggressive signals while the female\nlooks on, apparently uninterested in\nthe whole display. Research into\nanimal courtship behaviour has shown\nthat male and female animals use a series of intricate courtship gestures.\nThe success that people have in sexual\nencounters is directly related to their\nability to send these courtship signals\nand recognise those that are being sent\nback. As with most body signals,\nwomen are far better at picking up\nand giving out these messages. Men,\nhowever, are often totally blind to\nthem. Because of this factor, women\nhave a greater range of courtship\ngestures than men.\nMen\nMost men tend to start 'preening'\nthemselves when a woman\napproaches. A man will sit up and\nthrow his shoulders back, while\nreaching for his throat and\nstraightening his tie, or brushing\nimaginary particles off his trousers\nand sleeves. He may also smooth his\nhair. Men are not very good at\nappearing 'sexy'. The most sexually\naggressive display a man can make is\nthe thumbs-in-the-top-of-pockets\ngesture, which we mentioned last\nweek, in order to highlight his genital\nregion. Alternatively, if he is seated,\nhe may spread his legs to give a crotch\ndisplay.\nIf he is really going for it, he will\nuse his eyes to get the message across.\nHe can use an intimate gaze for just\na split second longer than is normal\nand moisten his lips. Should he be\naroused, his pupils will dilate, which\nshould be a clear message to the\nfemale that he is ready for action.\nWomen\nWomen will also use preening\ngestures to attract a man. Inese\ninclude playing with their hair,\nsmoothing clothing, using the\nextended intimate gaze and increasing\neye contact. As well as pupil dilation,\nthey will also gain a flushed\nappearance to the cheeks, indicating\nwild sexual desire.\nHair is very important in female\ncourtship gestures. This is why many\nwomen who are interested will toss\ntheir hair away from the face by a flick of the head. Even women with\nvery short hair use this head flick\nmotion. The woman's wrist area is a highly erotic area of her body which\nis why women wear bracelets to\naccentuate the region. An interested\nfemale will gradually expose her\nwrists as she is talking to the male.\nThis also explains why so many\nwomen like to smoke in party\nsituations: smoking makes this\ntant a lising wrist exposure very easy\nto perform. These wrist and head flick\ngestures are also used by homosexual\nmales who want to take on a feminine\nappearance. This is why many women\ncan tell if a man is gay just by\nspending a few minutes with him.\nResearch has shown that sexually\naggressive women will open their legs\nwider when a man enters the room.\nThis will happen whether the woman\nis sitting or standing. However, the\nsexually defensive woman will\nusually cross her legs or keep them\ntogether at all times.\nSome of the more subtle of\ncourtship gestures have been used to\nsell goods for centuries. Take a look\nat all the advertising in Sunday\nmagazines and in the tube stations\nwhich contains women with wet lips,\nmaking sideways glances and pouting\ngestures. With partially dropped\neyelids, the model holds a fixed gaze\nand parts her lips, inviting the man\nto buy whatever she may be holding.\nDr Desmond Morris described the\nmouth slightly open, wet-lipped look\nas a self mimicry as it is intended to\nsymbolise the female genital region.\nWomen can either wet their lips\nnaturally or use glossy cosmetics to\ncreate a more long-lasting effect.\nWhichever method is used, they are\nintended to give the woman the\nappearance of sexual invitation.\nWhen a woman is sexually aroused\nher lips grow larger and redden as\nthey fill with blood. This is the idea\nbehind the use of lipstick.\nThere are many ways to spot if a woman is aroused. As well as those\nwe have already mentioned, a fondled\n9B cigarette, the stem of a wine glass or\na finger, is an unconscious indication\nof what may be in the mind. Other\nsignals include crossing and\nun crossing the legs slowly in front of\nthe man and gently stroking the thighs\nwith her hand, indicating a desire to\nbe touched.\nSo next time you play the casual\nobserver at a party, watch for the\nsignals that are unconsciously thrown\nacross the room. Even better, use\nwhat you have learnt to better predict\nyour chances when you meet someone\nyou fancy.\nFELIX Friday March 4th19887 "
