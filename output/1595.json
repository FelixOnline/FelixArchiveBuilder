It is unclear why exactly\nthe unaccompanied vocal music\nbecame popular, but we can guess\nthat it was either popularised by\nChristian opponents to the use of\ninstruments in church music or the\nlack of instruments themselves. A\ncappella seems to have been revived\nat the opening of the 20th\ncentury,\nstarting with the traditional music,\nthen evolving with styles such as\nBarbershop in the 1930s slowly\nbecoming the kind of performances\nwe recognise.\nI manage to find some performers\nbefore the event started, to find out\ntheir thoughts on the upcoming\ncompetition. \u201cThe competition this\nyear is very, very good,\u201d Sana Mohajer\nof the renowned all-male King\u2019s\nCollege London group All the King\u2019s\nMen tells me. \u201cThe standard is very\nhigh \u2013 all the groups know each other\nquite well from various national\ncompetitions,\u201d implying of course\nthat these are the standard high-fliers\nwho tour the country on a regular\nbasis.\nHis group, now in their fifth year,\nhas won all the London regional\nfinals of The Voice Festival UK in\naddition to the overall competition in\n2012 and has previously qualified for\nthe ICCA Finals twice already, as well\nas touring the whole world.\nThe three Imperial College home\nteams could not be more different in\nstyle from one another. The Scopes,\nImperial\u2019s mixed team entrants,\nconcisely summed up their styles\nby comparing the groups to animal\npersonalities.\n\u201cI guess we would be fireflies -when we were formed (the founding\nmembers are still in the group today)\na few years back \u2018Fireflies\u2019 by Owl\nCity was the first song we covered.\nFireflies suit us as we\u2019re very easy\ngoing and focus on having fun first of\nall and don\u2019t worry too much about\nwinning competitions like these. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t give it our\nall, though!\n\u201cThe Techtonics are Imperial\u2019s\noldest and most well-known group.\nAn all-male ensemble of scientists\nand engineers into electronic music\nis definitely unique and interesting,\nbut considering their personalities...\ndefinitely something canine. No,\nwolves would be better to describe\nthem. But they\u2019re cheeky on their off\ndays too \u2013 cheeky wolves.\n\u201cOn the other hand, we get the\nImperielles \u2013 the sassy all-female\ngroup resident here. This one\u2019s easy \u2013\nswans. They\u2019re elegant yet aggressive\nwhen you get too close to them: the\nperfect description.\u201d\nI ask Beth of the Imperielles what\nit\u2019s like to be living out the film Pitch\nPerfect. Is the first time in such a big\ncompetition overwhelming, and you\nneed to suspend your disbelief of the\nreality? \u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019ve come\nto terms with it quite nicely,\u201d is the\nreply. \u201cWhenever my friends ask me\nwhat this is, I always start explaining\nwith \u201cWell, you know the film Pitch\nPerfect...\u201d\nSpeaking to each group is very\neasy; all the members have similar\nbut distinct personalities and keep\na constant stream of playful chatter\ngoing on their way to finding an\nanswer \u2013 it feels like speaking with\none person with multiple voices\nrather than a group; that\u2019s how close\nthey are. I speak to Tammy, again\nfrom the Imperielles, about her\nupcoming solo.\n\u201cYou have to remember that I\nhaven\u2019t been part of the group for\nvery long at all,\u201d she tells me. \u201cLess\nthan a year in fact - and now I\u2019m\nabout to sing in front of this massive\naudience and it would be a bare-faced\nlie to say that I\u2019m not nervous at\nall.\u201d Tammy went on to receive the\nspecial award for Best Soloist in the\ncompetition.\nI didn\u2019t get a chance to speak to\nDurham\u2019s entry, The Northern\nLights, but did witness their\nimpressive performance on stage.\nFounded at the end of the 2012/13\nacademic year, they are Durham\u2019s\nfirst a cappella group \u2013 showing just\nhow much a cappella is exploding\naround the country over the last\ndecade or so.\nThe biggest group and mixed group\noverall, they played it safe with\nupbeat pop arrangements. Even so,\nthe harmony was fantastic to listen\nto and the group was relaxed on stage\nfor their biggest competition yet, and\nthey took home the award for Best\nVocal Percussion for their beatboxer.\nThe Trinitones, Ireland\u2019s only\na cappella entry, put on a bolder\nperformance. Arranging \u2018Stacy\u2019s\nMom\u2019 into a choral performance\nmade the audience chuckle with\ndelight and making fun of Akon\nalong with mashing up his songs\nwas on their agenda too. Just as the\nDurham group must have felt, being\nthe only Irish entry put them under\nslightly more pressure than the\nothers. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of what\npeople assume \u2013 it is a fact that we\nare representing the whole of Ireland\nhere because we are the only Irish\nhere so it\u2019s extra important that we\ngive it our all.\u201d\nAs a cappella expands, however,\nplaces like the North and Ireland will\ninevitably see more groups springing\nup and thus even more regional\ncompetitions to hone their skills in.\nBut when management of the group\ncomes into play, there are bound to\nbe tensions arising from differences\nof opinion, even among the closest\nof friends, right? \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d\nargues Rob, the president of the\nall-male Exeter group Semi-Toned.\n\u201cI scream and shout at them all day\nbut they\u2019re so hardworking and\nunderstanding it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nEven for modern a cappella,\nSemi-Toned\u2019s arrangements are still\noutlandishly brilliant, performing\nvariations from Kanye West to\nDisney and Game of Thrones in the\nsame routine. Their hard work and\ncreativity paid off, coming second\noverall, and winning the Best\n\"The\ncompetition\nthis year is\nvery, very\ngood,\"\n\"But they\u2019re\ncheeky on\ntheir off\ndays too\n\u2013 cheeky\nwolves.\"\nAbove: The Techtonics performing at the com\n\u201cThe\nthis y\nvery\n\n"

Jennie Watson, the\nImperial College School of Medicine\nStudents\u2019 Union (ICSMSU) Welfare\nofficer and the driving force behind\nthe survey, came to Felix when she\nfound that the situation may have\nbeen more worrying than once\nthought.\nGoing through the data was grim,\nespecially when looking at students\u2019\nincome and outgoings, along with\nthe free text responses students had\nsubmitted. However, what does seem\nodd is how this issue has seemingly\nnever been raised before. Do many\nstudents just suffer in silence, and\nchalk it up to the experience of being\na poor student in London?\nHowever, what is more shocking\nis how the lack of funding for these\nstudents compares to the large\nbursaries showered down on other\nundergraduates. With the bursary\nchange for the next academic year\nlooking to reward students with the\nlowest household income \u00a34000\nmore than the College estimates\nshould be enough to cover total living\ncosts, one could argue that the system\ncould be a lot better balanced.\nJust as the bursary change this\nyear ensured those with less bursary\nbecause of higher household income\nnow get a bit more, maybe addressing\nthose who are arguably under the\nmost pressure, and at such a critical\npoint in their medical degree, is the\nnext step.\nIt is great that Imperial offers\nall these student support funds,\nbut maybe College should also be\ninvesting in making sure these\nstudents don\u2019t reach such a dire point\nas to have to apply for such funds in\nthe first place.\nObviously we need to consider\nthe fact that students who filled in\nthe survey may be biased, in that\nthose already struggling are more\ninclined to fill it in, but at the same\ntime, average figures don\u2019t lie. You\ndon\u2019t have to ask clinical medical\nstudents to find out how high rent\nis nowadays, how much travel is\nand how easy it is for money to\nsimply run out before the next loan\ninstalment.\nWith Imperial attracting more and\nmore international students who\nare already paying extortionate fees,\nand the number of home students\nchoosing not to study in London\nbecause of the cost, the system\nneeds to shift in order to keep us\ncomfortably in the capital and make\nit worth travelling to study here in\nthe first place. We know Imperial\nisn\u2019t quite made of money, but I\nreckon it has a bit more rattling\naround in its big old endowment\npurse that students would be\nextremely grateful for.\nThe Felix Sex Survey 2015\nTell us what shocking things you get up to\nwww.felixonline.co.uk/sexsurvey\n100% anonymous and conidential\nWhat\u2019s on this week:\nACC Bar Night\nTheme: Superheroes and\nVillains\n20:00, you know where.\nWednesday 4th February\n\u00a38.50 online and includes 4\nfree drinks and bombs, or\n\u00a39.50 on the door.\nSend any unwanted drinks\nto the Felix Editor, probably\nfound dancing on a table in\nthe cat costume.\nSsh, no tears, only dreams\nnow.\n\n"

The Techtonics take this belief\nto another level: they deliberately\ndon\u2019t have a set style, motto, credo,\nor any rules at all to stick by when\ncoming up with routines. \u201cIt\u2019s the\nmembers which define the group, not\nthe other way round,\u201d they tell me.\nPrevious members often come to\ntheir concerts or watch them busking\non Portobello Road on Saturday\nmornings to see which direction the\ngroup has taken since their departure.\nAll the King\u2019s Men hold the same\nview, with Sara telling me that\nthe group plays to each member\u2019s\nstrengths and highlights the talents\nwithin the group.\n\u201cI\u2019m a soul singer, so I get those\nkinds of solos, but we also have\neverything from pop to choral\narrangements, simply because we\nhave those kinds of singers who\nspecialise in that stuff.\u201d\nIndeed, their performance did\nfeature a choral arrangement, as\nwell as hits from Wham and Tina\nTurner \u2013 winning their arranger the\nOutstanding Arrangement award.\nTheir amazing display of excellence\nall around secured them their first\nplace and the coveted entry in the\nICCA Finals \u2013 but by only two points,\n371 to Semi-Toned\u2019s 369.\nThe hosts and guest stars, former\ncompetition winners turned\nprofessional, The Sons of Pitches,\nwere engaging and creative with the\naudience throughout the evening.\nFormed in Birmingham in 2010,\nwhich is actually more recent than\nsome of the competition entrants,\nthey received many awards over the\nyears for their singing.\nAfter winning the ICCA\u2019s\nInternational Wildcard Round in\n2013 and competing in New York\nfor the finals, The Sons of Pitches\nwent on to become a professional a\ncappella ensemble, hosting these sorts\nof events around the country.\nPutting on a simultaneously funny\nand astounding performance during\nthe judging, there was never a dull\nmoment as they kept singing right\nup until the judging was finished,\nmeaning that the audience was always\nwitnessing some amazing talent, be\nit song improvisation on the spot,\nrenditions of a cappella club remixes,\nor inviting audience members on\nstage to perform with them. It was an\nauditory treat to hear them perform\ntheir first single \u2018Laura\u2019 live, with\nthe assistance of a gospel choir which\nmanaged to sneak itself on backstage.\nWith the winners now looking to\ntravel to New York to compete in\nthe final against teams from around\nthe world, it is incredible how far a\ncappella can take a group of students\nused to practising in empty lecture\ntheatres or deserted seminar rooms.\nFelix wishes the best of luck to All\nthe Kings Men, and will be waiting\neagerly to hear how they get on over\nin the States.\ncompetition\nyear is very,\ngood\u201d\n\n"

This\nis not a show that gives you faith in\nhumanity.\nOne of the problems with House\nof Cards is that the Underwoods\nare implausibly effective at getting\nwhat they want, to the point where\nother characters seem slow and\nuncalculating by comparison.\nPresident Walker, for instance,\nis unrealistically susceptible to\nmanipulation. Given that it appears\nto take a man as Machiavellian as\nFrank to make it to the top spot,\nGarrett Walker is remarkably easy\nprey.\nAnother issue with House of Cards\nis that, so far, Frank has not been\nseriously challenged yet. Sure, he\u2019s\nexperienced small setbacks but\nnothing that has really tested him\nor pushed him anywhere near his\nbreaking point. Great television\nseries of the past such as Breaking Bad,\nThe Wire and The Sopranos allowed\nthe audience to see the weaknesses\nin their protagonists, whether they\nwere a hero or anti-hero. But the\nwriters for House of Cards have\nso far produced a plot that only\nserves obstacles that the audience is\nconfident Underwood can conquer.\nHowever, series three is likely to put\nan end to this.\nThere is no denying that House of\nCards is Kevin Spacey\u2019s show. It\u2019s all\nabout Frank. This makes all the other\nsubplots pale in comparison and you\nquickly begin to lose interest. The\nguinea-pig wielding cyberterrorist in\nseries two for instance, and even Zoe\u2019s\nex-boyfriend\u2019s investigations, is far\nless interesting than whatever Frank\nis doing. House of Cards has some of\nthe best individual scenes I\u2019ve ever\nseen on the small screen but the show\nbounces around a little more than\nwant it to and the plot feels disjointed\nas a result.\nThroughout House of Cards there are\nsome startling moments that come\nout of nowhere and are never referred\nto again. A lot of these events are\nsignificant to the character\u2019s involved\nbut do not contribute one jot towards\nthe overall storyline. Since all of\nthese moments have so far remained\nunexplored it looks as though the\nwriter\u2019s just shoehorned some\nsurprising twists into the script for\nshock value, much to the detriment\nof the overall series. It smacks of a last\nminute attempt to add intrigue but\non reflection these moments feel like\nhollow shocks, with nothing behind\nthem to add to the story.\nCredit must go to the\ncinematographer Eigil Bryld for\ncreating such an enthralling and\nsecretive atmosphere, even when\na scene is being filmed in broad\ndaylight. The production quality\ngenerally is first class. Several\ndirectors have shot two or three\nchapters, but David Fincher\u2019s early\ninfluence left a strong impression\non the whole show. House of Cards\nis beautifully shot and Jeff Beal\u2019s\nfantastic soundtrack features a\ntrickling piano solo that perfectly\ncaptures the sly, calculative mindset\nof the characters.\nDespite being a political thriller,\n\"I am\nwilling to\nlet your\nchild\nwither\nand die\ninside you\nif that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s\nrequired.\"\nHouse of Cards is as much a character\nstudy of Frank than it is a series\nabout Washington politics. With a\nstellar cast and great dialogue, House\nof Cards is a delicious meditation on\npower and amorality that is confident\nin its execution and elegant in its\npresentation. It features a universally\nexcellent set of performances by\nthe cast and Spacey in particular\nmust be praised for owning his\ndemanding character to become one\nof television\u2019s best antiheroes.\nEver since its release there has been\na lot of talk about how House of Cards\nis a revolutionary piece of television,\nbut while it is a true pleasure to watch,\nit doesn\u2019t bring very much to the table\nin terms of commentary that wasn\u2019t\nalready there before. This is a show\nthat captured the zeitgeist and turned\nit up to eleven, instead of challenging\npresumptions. The series takes the\nsame cynical stance as almost every\nother political show in the last few\ndecades that wasn\u2019t written by Aaron\nSorkin. House of Cards is a series that\ntells us mostly what we already know,\nand it does not go about telling it in\nas subtle or intelligent a way as, say,\nMad Men or Breaking Bad. In the\nwhole series, the most striking and\nfresh aspect of House of Cards is the\ndynamic between Frank and Claire.\nDespite Frank\u2019s morally\nirreprehensible behavior and\ntwisted morality, there is a curious\ntemptation to will him on, to see how\nfar the Underwood\u2019s can get before\nit all falls apart. Frank is the kind\nof unscrupulous political operator\nthat we all hope doesn\u2019t really exist.\n\"There is\nno denying\nthat House\nof Cards\nis Kevin\nSpacey\u2019s\nshow.\"\nThe idea that democracy is a veil\nfor the rich and powerful to exert\nhuge influence is a terrifying one;\nbut crucially, it is a compelling one.\nWe all want to see how Frank\u2019s story\nplays out. Will he become President\nand succeed as leader of the free\nworld, or will his meteoric ascent end\nup collapsing like\u2026 well like a House\nof Cards?\nBest served in the form of late night\nbinges, House of Cards is very good at\npersuading you to click \u2018Next Episode\u2019\nwhen you should probably go to bed.\nIt\u2019s a heavyweight piece of television,\njust as Netflix is now a heavyweight\ncontent provider. All there is to say is\ngive it a go. Soon you\u2019ll be hypnotized.\nSeries 3 will be on Netflix Feb. 27th.\nPhoto: Beau Willimon, Netflix\n\n"

You don\u2019t\njust have one endless world but an endless amount\nof endless worlds.Can you start to see why I ind this\nscenario so fascinating?\nAnother aspect that draws me to this genre is the\ntechnology that permeates these games.I love\ntechnology and the creative minds behind these\nideas that could soon become reality.I mean how do\nlaser guns,warp drives and teleportation not sound\namazing?\nHowever,if I really think about it,neither\nthe endlessness of the game's world nor the\ntechnological fantasy are the factors that decide\nwhy I fall in love with these games.The reason I\nreally love to start up Space Engineers,Sins of a Solar\nEmpire or FTL is the fact that I am able to see things\nand experience things that I will never realistically\nbe able to.But then again,you could say that about\nany fantasy game.I will never be a goat who licks\nstuff or be a Dragonborn.What is different about\nspace games is that what I am looking at is stuff that\nactually is real in some way.If I had been alive in a\nlater millennium I could possibly be flying around\nthe Milky Way,smuggling goods and ighting off\nspace pirates.\nAnyhow,what you have to the left here are three\ngames that I mentioned in my previous article,and\nfelt that I wanted to go into depth exploring their\ndifferences,strengths and weaknesses.Have fun!\n\"This game\nis for you\nif you want\nplay a space\ngame, and\nyou want to\nplay it now.\"\nElite: Dangerous\nIf you are talking about space\ngames, the Elite series is one that stirs\ngood memories for many a gamer.\nSadly, the last entry in this illustrious\nseries was released back in 1995,\nmeaning that many of the newer\ngeneration of gamers never really\nhad the opportunity to play this.\nTherefore when Elite: Dangerous was\noffered up on kickstarter, it wasn\u2019t\nlong before it reached its target goal.\nNow available on PC, what makes\nthis game different from the other\nentries on this list?\nWell obviously it\u2019s available, which\nNo Man\u2019s Sky or Star Citizen can\u2019t\nclaim. The galaxy that you play in is\nmodelled on our own Milky Way with\nabout 400 billion star systems, where\n150,000 of those are modelled on real\ndata. You are given a small amount of\nmoney and a ship and make your own\nstory. Currently you are only limited\nto your ship, but updates are planned\nthat will allow you to walk around\nand interact with NPCs. The game is\nalso fully online, meaning that even\nthe solo game-play will require an\ninternet connection. On the other\nhand, the MMO component features\na persistant world, where specific\nareas are instances to a certain\nnumber of players.\nThis game is for you if you want\nplay a space game, and you want to\nplay it now. Overall it has gotten\nreally good reviews, and while the\nlearning curve may be a bit steep, it\ndoes look really like something that\ncould be immensely enjoyable.\nNo Man\u2019s Sky\nWhen this game was shown off by\nHello Games at E3, it completely\nblew most people\u2019s minds. No\nMan\u2019s Sky looked like the space\ngame we have always wanted, and\nit has mostly been developed in\nsecret, under the codename Project\nSkyscraper. This game\u2019s universe is\ncompletely procedurally generated\nand will be based on a 64-bit seed\nkey. This means that this game can\ncreate more than 18 quintillion\nplanets (18 followed by 18 zeros) for\nyou to explore. However, this does\nnot even include all the possibilities\nof flora and fauna, which are\ngenerated in the exact same way. So\nnot only do you seamlessly get to fly\nfrom space to the planet\u2019s surface,\nyou can jump out and inspect the\nanimals, name their species and\ncategorize them!\nThat\u2019s the name and aim of\nthe game that is No Man\u2019s Sky.\nWhile there are some elements of\ncharacter and ship upgrades, the\nbiggest feature of this game will\nbe its exploration possibilities.\nFurthermore, there is rather little\nmultiplayer, with the focus being\non you having fun (yay offline solo\ngames!). The only ability for you\nto interact with other players is\nthrough exploration updates on\nwhat you have discovered, as well\nas allowing them to visit planets\nthat you previously have visited\n\u2013 however, only once they have\nhyperdrive capabilities.\nSadly this game is not out yet,\nand there is no fixed release date,\nhowever, a 2015 launch is promised.\nThis game is for you if you\ndon\u2019t really care much about the\nfighting, and trading and all those\nshenanigans and prefer to explore\nthings, seeing marvellous new\nworlds, watch fascinating creatures\nand name them anything you want.\nWhat this game will hopefully be is\na beautiful journey with views that\nwon\u2019t disappoint.\nStar Citizen\nThisisthegamethatIamlooking\nforwardtothemost.Thisgamehasa\nsolidfoundationinoldprequels,and\nwascrowdfundedtotheridiculous\namountof$68milliontodate,with\nmorecomingindaily.Ratherthan\nworkingwithproceduralgeneration,\nthedevelopmentteamatRobertSpace\nIndustrieshavecraftedover60unique\nstarsystems,andtheylookincredibly\nbeautifulforit.However,exploringthe\nentiretyofaplanet,orevenmanually\nflyingtotheirsurfacesadlyaren\u2019t\nfeaturesthatarecurrentlyplannedin\nthegame.\nStarCitizenisallabouthyperrealism,\nfromtheship\u2019sthrustersthatalign\nthemselvesinamannerthatreal\nthrusterswouldaswelltothepersistent\nworldeconomythatisfuelledbythe\nsuppliesanddemandsoftheplayers.\nFurthermore,thisgamedoesn\u2019tjust\nfocusonthepilotingofthespaceships,\nbutalsohasanincrediblyvisualwalk-aroundmodethatallowsyoutowalk\naroundyourship,ontotradinghubsor\nplanetsurfaces.Thegamewillalsohave\naverywellintegratedFPSelement,\nmeaningthatnotonlydoyougetyour\nspacefix,butalsoyourpew-pew-laser-fpsfix.Thecoolestthingofall?Thisall\nhappensinauniversethatispersistent\nandinfluencedbytheplayersplayingit.\nTheeconomyisjustanexampleofhow\nyouractionscanhaveadirectimpacton\nthegame!\nWhilethismaybemymost\nanticipatedgame,itisalsotheone\nthathasthelatestreleasedate,namely\nsometimein2016.However,the\ndevelopersarereleasingmodules\nthatgiveyoupartsofthegamenow,\nmeaningyoucanhaveapopatsome\nfeatures.\nThisgameisforyouifyouenjoy\nsuperrealisticgames,without\nnecessarilyneedingthefullexploring\nthing.However,insteadofexploring\nyoucanstillindulgeincorneringthe\nmarket,becomingapirateinthefringe\nregionsorsmugglegoodsacrossthe\ngalaxy.Itisyouradventure.\nif you want\nplay a space\ngame, and\nyou want to\nplay it now.\"\nPhoto: outofthedarkness.info Photo: gamebreaker.tv\nPhoto: forbes.com\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 23\nFELIX 30.01.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial\u2019s Hidden Artistic Treasures\nEvery morning, students stream\ninto Imperial College from\nQueen\u2019s Gate, turning in at\nImperial College Road and passing by\na red brick house on their left without\nas much as a second glance. Few\nstudents realise that the Victorian\ntownhouse is both Grade II Listed,\nand the residence of the President of\nthe College.\nCompleted in 1889, 170 Queen\u2019s\nGate, as it is now known, was acquired\nby the college after the Second World\nWar and subsequently scheduled as\na \u2018building of special architectural or\nhistoric interest\u2019 in 1958.\nIt was designed by the Victorian\narchitect Richard Norman Shaw,\narguably one of the most influential\nand prolific British architects whose\nother works include the Romanesque\nbuildings of the old New Scotland\nYard premises along Embankment\nand the old English houses of Bedford\nPark; upon closer inspection, one will\nnotice beautiful carvings above the\nentrance, and a family crest on the\nfront door.\nWhile the upper floors are\ndesignated as Rector\u2019s Lodging,\nthe ground floor is mainly a venue\nfor corporate events, receptions,\nseminars or weddings. I had the\nprivilege of exploring its premises\nrecently and what fascinated me was\nthe substantial collection of college-owned art it housed.\nIn what is known as the Solar Room\n(shafts of sunlight streamed gently\ninto the room while I was visiting),\nthere is an impressive collection\nof Russian paintings on display.\nFrom portraits, to snowy Russian\nlandscapes, and even to costume\ndesigns, the paintings were originally\nloaned to the college by Professor\nAlexander Kennaway in 1989 and\nvariously donated to and purchased\nby Imperial College in 2007. Now a\npermanent part of the College\u2019s art\ncollection, they add sophistication\nand style to the room, making it look\nalmost like a small art gallery.\nIn the adjacent drawing room, a\npainting by John Everett Millais\ncaught my eye \u2013 a cofounder of the\nPre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848,\nMillais was involved in a movement\nthat rejected the mechanistic style\nof artists such as Raphael and\nMichelangelo, instead advocating for\na return to attentive detail, intense\ncolours, and the influence of nature.\nThis particular painting, For the\nSquire, is a painting on loan to the\ncollege by one of its professors and\nshows a girl holding a piece of paper\nin her hands, looking up expectantly.\nThe natural colours and mundane\nsubject matter is characteristic of\nMillais\u2019 late style.\nIn the largest room, the Council\nRoom, the walls are adorned with\nSir John Everett Millais, For the Squire, 1882\nJingjie Cheng gets a behind the scenes look at 170 Queen\u2019s Gate\nportraits of rectors past and present.\nPortraits of past rectors are arranged\nchronologically along the walls, from\nthe second rector Sir Alfred Keogh\nwho is depicted in full military dress\nuniform (he was the Director General\nof army medical services prior to\nbecoming Rector) up to Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions, shown before a montage\nof buildings for Imperial West\ndevelopment.\nThere is also a painting of Prince\nAlbert which was presented to\nImperial College by the Queen\nin 1957 \u2013 besides being closely\nassociated with the Royal College\nof Chemistry and the Royal School\nof Mines, Prince Albert was\ninstrumental in the development of\nthe South Kensington area as a site for\neducation in science and the arts.\nThe house as an historic building\nis a concern of our College Archivist\nAnne Barrett; she takes care of\nthe paintings, and has meticulous\nknowledge of the treasures\naccumulated by the college over the\nyears. Despite having been here for\nmore than a year, I had never really\nthought about the rich history and\nculture that must hide beneath the\nglitzy fa\u00e7ade of the business school\nor the grey, monolithic buildings on\ncampus. It strikes me as somewhat\nironic that these treasures are\nhidden away, seen more by outsiders\nrenting the venue rather than the\nCollege\u2019s own students, but Ms\nBarrett explained that there is a\nlack of suitable spaces on campus\nto hang valuable works of art or\nexhibits in general. Pieces that are\ndisplayed, however, such as those in\nthe glass cases on the first floor of\nthe SAF building, seem to go largely\nunnoticed by students.\nPerhaps a greater appreciation\nof the history of the College will\ncultivate a stronger collective sense\nof belonging and pride to this\ninstitution in which we spend so\nmuch of our time.\nStudents who are interested are welcome\nto arrange a tour of 170 Queen\u2019s Gate\nwith Ms Barrett.\n\"It seems\nironic\nthat these\ntreasures\nare seen\nmore by\noutsiders\nthan the\ncollege's\nown\nstudents.\"\n\"I have\nnever\nthought\nabout\nthe rich\nhistory\nbehind\nthe glitzy\nfa\u00e7ade.\"\nEditorial: The\nDiversity Issue\nFollowing on from our exploration\nof hidden art last week,we are\nlooking at diversity in art and\nwhether we,as art consumers,are\ngetting a representative view of art\nproduced throughout our society.\nIn our irst article,Jingjie Cheng\nvisits Imperial College's 170\nQueen's Gate,the home of the\nuniversity's president and a\npopular venue for events.However,\nunknown to students,the building\nis a veritable treasure trove of\nartistic masterpieces.\nNext,following a number of\nhighly publicised comments,\nIndira Mallik examines diversity\nin art and whether minorities\nget fair exposure in the arts,or\nwhether there exists an elite\nclub of the privileged few who\nseem to run the show.Through\ndiversity comes richer culture,but\nis society becoming stunted by the\nstagnation of much of the world's\npopular art?\nJingjie visits Somerset House's new\nexhibition,MappingtheCity,seeing\nhow maps can be reinvented to\nreveal a different story.Whether\nconsciously or subconsciously,\nwe are exposed to maps every\nday,however we rarely pause to\nconsider their artistic value.This\nexhibition aims to paint them in\na new light,exploring how they\ncan be interpreted to tell us more\nabout the place they represent.\nMax Falkenberg lauds Tricycle\nTheatre's one woman production\nHappyBirthdayWithoutYou,a play\nby relatively unknown actress\nSonia Jalaly.It is extraordinarily\ndificult for one person,no\nmatter how experienced,to be\nable to command a stage all by\nthemselves and maintain the\nattention of a captive audience,\nbut Jalay\u2019s character Violet Fox\nmanages to do just this.\nFinally,Dara at the National\nTheatre tells the story of a\nMughal prince and his struggle\nof succession with his brothers,\non the background of the failing\nhealth of his father.Fred Fyles\nsees if this production,originally\nperformed at the Ajoka Theatre in\nPakistan,heralds a renaissance of\narts from other countries,covering\ntopics not usually raised in British\nart,or if falls short of its intended\ngoal.\nSo that\u2019s this week! Next time,\nwe will be discussing the theme\nof new frontiers,exploring how\nartists push boundaries or visit far\noff places.\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\n\n"

The other 5% is awarded if\nstudents fill in their name correctly at\nthe beginning of the test.\nHangman has been told that this\nbehaviour has been condemned as\n\u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cidiotic,\u201d and \u201ccompletely\nunexpected considering the nature of\nthe test.\u201d\nSaid one course convenor from the\nsocial studies department: \u201cWe ran\nthis hoping the students would band\ntogether, share the results and all\ncome out with full marks.\n\u201cInstead it seems they all managed\nto scrape a 2.2 honestly and fairly. I\ncan only imagine what impact this\nmay have on our league ratings. Can\nuniversities be relegated?\u201d\nThe exam, taken by approximately\n400 students from various\nhumanities courses including media\nmanagement, golf management,\nmanaging management and also\nbiology, was set online, and featured\nfive multiple choice questions that\nthey had five hours to complete.\nThe questions covered topics\nincluding pocket money\nmanagement, how to apply for job\nseekers allowance and the perceived\nmonetary worth of Kim Kardashian.\nHangman spoke to a second year\ntravel and tourism student, who took\nthe exam on Monday. We met him\nThe scenes of group work and collaboration the uni was hoping for\nTerror at\nA Cappella\nconcert due to\nspontaneous\novary explosion\nTragedy unfolded on Saturday\nas what started as a joyous\ncelebration of A Cappella\nended in a bloodbath, where no one\ncould have possibly anticipated the\neffects of bringing attractive boys to\nImperial.\nThe preliminary signs that\nsuggested there was trouble within\nthe audience became apparent as\nthe Trinitones began their set. The\nIrish lads, hailing from Trinity\nCollege, put on a 12 minute set that\nincluded a disturbing amount of hip\nthrusting, which, according to the\njudges, was just below the threshold\nof the maximum amount of thrusts\nallowed in a competitive A Cappella\ncompetition.\nThere were signs that the thrusting\nhad increased the agitation within\nthe audience; however, it was not\nuntil All the King\u2019s Men from Kings\nCollege arrived on stage did the\norganisers realize the gravity of the\nmistake they had made.\nUnbeknownst to many of the\nshow\u2019s producers, there is a scientific\nphenomenon where a hormone\nnamed \u2018techtonictestosterone\u2019 is\nproduced exclusively in desperate\nsingle women when the harmonic\nresonance of an all-male A Cappella\nchoir hits a D Maj-7 chord.\nThis hormone then causes a\nbiological ovary implosion leading to\n70% aca-fatality rate and as you can\nimagine, the results were horrendous:\neight ambulances had to be called to\nthe Great Hall only one minute into\nthe Techtonics opening song, sang\nby fresh faced Kizra Etson, a first\nyear emo (ecology, microbiology and\nornithology) student.\nAnother twelve paramedics were\ndispatched during the hair-flipping\nheavy set of Semi-Toned, an all male\ngroup from Exeter. An impromptu\nmedical tent was sent up on the\nSherfield walkway distributing dry\nknickers, hand fans and photos of\nNoel Edmunds for women to look at\nto calm down.\nThe producer of the show, told\nHangman: \u201cUsually we expect one or\ntwo members of the audience to die\nfrom the high levels of campness, but\nnothing on this scale.\u201d\nOne student who did not enjoy\nthe show was the Deputy President\n(Heterosexual) Kris Caye, who spent\nmost of the night on Tinder. He did\nperk up when the all-female team\nfrom University of St. Andrews took\nto the stage, although was unable to\nfocus on the set as was responsible\nfor mopping up under the seat of the\nFelix Editor. Caye said to Hangman\nafterwards: \u201cIt was exhausting,\nalthough if I didn\u2019t stem the flow\npeople in the back rows may have\nbeen literally washed away.\u201d\nin a local coffee shop, where he was\nskimming through his photos from\nhis recent trip to the Phi Phi Islands.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just that, we have a lot\nof time to study and not really any\npressure to like, you know, do well. I\ndon\u2019t have any grand, high pressure\ngrad schemes lined up, so why would I\nbe tempted to cheat, you know?\u201d\nHangman spoke to another student,\nthis time a third year reading General\nStudies. She told us: \u201cAs I only have\nfour contact hours a week, and you\nknow, no crippling international\nstudent fees to deal with, I thought,\nwhy bother taking advantage of a\ncompletely flawed, opened ended\nsystem, one that was just waiting to be\nmilked for all it was worth?\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind getting a 2.2, I\nactually enjoy university, have a great\nsocial life and don\u2019t even bother going\nto the library.\n\u201cEven if I leave with no job, the\namazing experience I would have had\nwill be worth it.\u201d\n\n"

Council members\nwere told that they had until 12:00\nFriday 16th\nJanuary to reply with\ntheir decisions on three of the papers.\nThe email vote was answered by 27\nmembers, including three cast after\nthe deadline.\nThe most debated paper by far is\nthat regarding publishing a voting\nrecord of any decisions passed by\nCouncil. The standard procedure has\npreviously been a vote by show of\nhands, or by secret ballot in the case\nof a confidential vote.\nHowever, publishing votes would\nhold the elected Union officers\naccountable to accurately represent\nthe opinions of the wider Imperial\npopulation.\nSocial Clubs Committee (SCC) Chair\nTom Rivlin, told Felix: \u201cI just agreed\nwith the principle of the proposal [to\npublish people\u2019s votes]\u2026 I represent\n\u2018constituents\u2019 who chose me to\nrepresent them. They have the right\nto know if I\u2019m doing what\u2019s in their\nbest interests.\u201d\nIn contrast, an ordinary member\nwho wished to remain anonymous\nstated \u201cmembers might feel cornered\ninto voting according to popular\nopinion, instead of voting according\nto what they feel is the correct path of\naction\u201d.\nRoyal College of Science Union\n(RCSU) Secretary Philip Kent also\noffered an opinion \u201carguments have\nbeen made for this making the Union\nmore democratic \u2013 personally I would\nrather Council put more effort into\nincreasing student awareness and\nengagement with Council rather than\nspending hours on something which I\nsuspect few people will ever look at\u201d.\nDariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli,\nImperial College School of Medicine\nStudent Union President (ICSMSU),\nproposed additional responsibilities\nto the Deputy President\u2019s role and\nthe creation of a Sponsorship Officer,\nwhich would outline clearer end-year\ngoals for the Deputy President and\nbring more money to the ICSMSU\nExecutive committee. He also\nproposed the removal of one of two\nSocial Secretaries, as one person could\neasily achieve the responsibilities.\nOutcomes of Union\nCouncil email vote\nreleased to members\nJune Yin Gan covers the resolutions of the\ncontroversial council papers, despite three\nvotes cast after deadline\nPrince Charles\nopens new centre\nat St. Mary\u2019s\nAnew centre for innovative\nsurgery has been opened by\nPrince Charles, the Prince of\nWales, at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital. The new\ncentre, created and run by Imperial\nCollege London, has been set up to\ndevelop new surgical techniques \u2013\nspecifically ones which can make\nsurgery quicker and easier.\nThe Surgical Innovation Centre, as\nit is called, is directed by Professor\nthe Lord Darzi, who said \u201cThe NHS\nis under considerable pressure in\nmeeting the challenge of shifting\npatient demographics, the burden\nof lifestyle disease and financial\nconstraints. Innovation through\nbetter technologies, processes and\ndesign can help address the challenges\nfacing health care delivery globally.\u201d\nThe centre features two state-of-the-art surgical theatres and is also the\ncountry\u2019s leading centre for bariatric\nsurgery (carrying out operations such\nas gastric bypass procedures).\nDevelopments seen by the heir to\nthe throne include surgery through a\nperson\u2019s belly button, which prevents\nscarring, and \u2018cyclops\u2019, which is an\nexpanding ring which can be inflated\ninside the body to remove growths.\nA number of techniques for medical\nteaching have also been created at the\ncentre, including a full-scale touchscreen skeleton model.\nAs part of the same event, the\nPrince of Wales also visited the\nHealth Innovation Exchange (HELIX)\npop-up studio, a collaboration with\nthe Royal College of Art, which\nutilises design techniques to treat\ndiseases and prevent common\nhealthcare issues.\nAt the HELIX studio, an app for\nanalysing children\u2019s breathing\npatterns to detect signs of asthma was\nalso demonstrated to the Prince.\nPrince Charles told reporters, \u201cI\nwas fascinated going around, trying\nto understand how you managed to\ncreate all these innovative inventions.\nMy great great great grandfather\nPrince Albert would have been very\nproud.\u201d\nIn the past year, nearly 2,000\npatients have been treated at\nthe centre as part of usual NHS\nprocedures. The centre can also\nprovide same-day consultation,\ndiagnosis, and treatment.\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nThe last paper presented was on\nincreasing the frequency of Union\nGeneral Meetings (GM), the purposes\nof which are to enable all members of\nthe Union to vote on policy decisions\nand to hold officers to account.\nIronically, neither the last GM and\nthe Council meeting met their quora\nof 200 and 27 respectively.\nAn email detailing the vote\u2019s results\nwas released to all Council members\non Friday last week, and included\ntime stamps to confirm when the\nonline votes were received through a\nonline Google form. When concerns\nwere raised about the security of the\nvoting method, Council Chair Paul\nBeaumont agreed to verify the votes\nwith all Council members.\nThree votes made by students, one\nas late as three days later, were still\ncounted. Had they been disqualified,\nthe email vote would have also failed\nto make quorum, and the papers\nwould have to be discussed at the next\nmeeting.\nThe email vote passed the changes\nto the ICSMSU constitution (26 for,\n2 abstentions) and agreed to publish\nindividuals\u2019 voting records (13 for,\n9 against, 6 abstentions), while the\npaper on increasing GM frequency\nwas rejected (9 for, 12 against, 7\nabstentions).\nAlthough many of the absences\nwere due to start-of-term exams,\nCouncil Chair Paul Beaumont\nexpressed disappointment at the\nturnout, telling Felix last week that\n\u201cit is a pity that some members of\nCouncil do not attend at all\u201d.\nSaid the Union on the votes\naccepted after the deadline: \u201cThe\ndeadline was an indicative date\nfor when Council members were\ninstructed to have recorded their\nvotes, it was never detailed that votes\ncounted after that date would not be\ncounted.\n\u201cThe vote was ratified at the point\nthe Council Chair did the count and\ndecided to accept all votes cast.\n\u201cThe votes cast after the initially\npublicised time did not affect the\noutcome of any of the votes, but did\nenable the vote to reach quorum.\u201d\nYes, this is the only council photo we have Photo: Cem Hurrell Dat Prince tho Image: IHMC\n\n"

    "content": "26 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n30.01.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMapping the City \u2013 Cartography Reimagined\nJingjie Cheng explores what Somerset House\u2019s newest exhibition can offer\nOne Woman\u2019s Triumph of Theatre\nMAX FALKENBERG\nARTS WRITER\nIf self is a location, so is love:\nBearings taken, markings, cardinal\npoints,\nOptions, obstinacies, dug heels and\ndistance,\nHere and there and now and then, a\nstance.\nThese words of well-loved poet\nSeamus Heaney resonated\nin my head as I explored this\nnew exhibition of street art and\ngraffiti at Somerset House. Despite\nbeing done in vastly different media\nand in all forms of presentation,\none idea united the eclectic\ncollection \u2013 all of them explored\nthe artists\u2019 relationships with their\nsurroundings. It was about giving\nphysical form to experiences and\ninteractions between man and space\nand making sense of the myriad ways\nthat places shape us.\nTake, for example, Martin\nTibabuzo\u2019s Mi Mundo/Meine Welt,\na delicate paper globe on which a\nworld map had been drawn. If one\nlooked closely, the map was strangely\ninaccurate, and while meticulous, was\nunorthodox in style. Tibabuzo had\nbegun to lose his memory in the early\n2000s and was advised to perform\nmemory exercises. This was one\nof the results \u2013 he had created this\nworld map entirely from memory.\nThis was his personal take on the\nworld, the world as he remembered\nand understood; at the same time,\nhis own experience of memory loss is\ninextricably associated with the art he\ncreated.\nIt is always interesting when\nfunctional objects are used as a basis\nfor art \u2013 it forces us to look at what\nwe encounter every day in a new\nlight, and the results can sometimes\nbe quite fascinating. Susumu Mukai\u2019s\nwhimsical fantasy land Regent\u2019s\nCanal is based on the walks he used\nto take there, but coloured with his\nimagination. I saw it as the map of his\nmind\u2019s world superimposed onto the\nmap of his surroundings, rendered\nin intricate detail. Along with the\ncreations he brought to the real\nworld, he also brought in his cultural\ninfluence \u2013 the creatures reminded\nme of Japanese folklore.\nThe small exhibition, which runs\ntill mid-February, is a collaboration\nbetween Somerset House and\ncollaborative arts organisation\nA(by)P. While there no doubt are\ngems to be found in the exhibition,\nmuch of it were artworks one might\nwalk past without a second glance.\nSome reminded me of unfinished\nexperiments, such as Jurne\u2019s four\npieces which trace some random\nshapes on maps of the Bay Area and\nParis, supposedly to show that being\n\u201copen to having experiences and\nopen to unpredictability can lead to\nfruition and growth\u201d \u2013 I failed to see\nthe link or anything innovative about\nit.\nAlthough the small interconnected\nrooms provide a very intimate\nexhibition space which seems\nappropriate for street art and\ngraffiti, the sheer number of\nartworks crammed in the small\nspace is somewhat disorienting,\nespecially since many of them\nare large and loud. The riotous\natmosphere, however, did remind me\nof the natural home of street art and\ngraffiti, which might be the point.\nMaps and the streets, to me, have\ngreat potential for innovative use\nSmart, sexy and absurd. One\nwoman shows do not get any\nbetter than this. For an hour\nof complete hilarity, Violet Fox\nrecounts her struggles to be an ever\nmore extraordinary artist for her\nexceptionally ordinary audience.\nWritten and performed by the\nunbelievably talented Sonia Jalaly,\nThe Story of Violet Fox explores the\nfrayed relationship with her mother\nthrough songs, impersonation and\nsatire.\nA series of crazy, imaginative skits,\nViolet Fox\u2019s charming physicality\nmakes you want to laugh and cry\nfrom start to finish.\nIf everyone had the commitment,\npassion and stage presence of Jalaly,\nI\u2019m convinced I would never see\nanother bad performance in my\nlife. Jalaly\u2019s ability to impersonate\nalmost anyone to perfection and sing\nwith such variation and breadth is\nunreal. Okay, maybe not anyone, just\nsome of the most famous theatrical\nfemale stars in Marilyn Monroe, Judy\nGarland, Julie Andrews etc. With\nevery impression, her performance\njust gets better and better. I never\nthought I would say this, but this\nshow made me warm and fuzzy\ninside. What more could I possibly\nwant? With an eye for even the\nmost subtle cultural observations, a\nmixture of audience interaction and\ndirect participation give the show an\nenergy so difficult to achieve in one-man shows.\nLike every comedy performance,\neven the smallest details have a major\neffect on how the audience responds.\nGenerally, Jalaly has this down to a\nT, her actions are so careful and so\nwell thought out that the majority\nof the time her performance blends\nperfectly with the story she is telling.\nVery occasionally, either the pacing\nor the continuation of the story is\nsomewhat lacking. However, for\na young, unknown actor, she has\nexceeded expectations so much that\nany criticism really comes as an\nafterthought.\nYes, the ending maybe drags on\nfor thirty seconds too long; yes,\nin art, and I was disappointed that\nthis exhibition did not have more\nmeaningful ideas. Much of modern\nart focuses more on the concept\nbehind the art rather than the skill of\nexecution itself, and a lack of artistic\nskill can be excused if the idea is\nclever. However, much of the artwork\nin this show seemed half-hearted, as\nif the artists were happy to stop at the\nmere representation of space without\nexploring further concepts such\nas time, identity or displacement.\nIs there more to one\u2019s experience\nin a city than making colourful\nwoodblocks of one\u2019s running route?\nOr dripping paint around New York\nto trace out your own name?\nmaybe the occasional scene is just too\nabsurd; but any realistic assessment\nof the show can only find these issues\ntrivial.\nWith fantastically hilarious scenes\nin broken French and mad games of\nmusical chairs, this show is definitely\nthe funniest and most carefully\nthought out that I have seen this year.\nThat said, I only got to see this show\nafter Jalaly had been performing\nit for almost a year. In that sort of\ntime, as is the case with every comedy\nperformance, sketches can be cut and\nnew material added to tweak a show\ninto its perfect state.\nDoes this diminish her\nachievement? Of course not, but other\nperformers should definitely learn\nfrom her.\n\"The\nfunniest\nand most\ncarefully\nthought\nout show I\nhave seen\nthis year.\"\n\"Her\ncharming\nphysicality\nmakes you\nwant to\nlaugh and\ncry from\nstart to\nfinish.\"\nIf you love energetic, experimental\nand raw artworks, you might find the\nexhibition a visual feast. But if you\nare like me and prefer more polished,\naesthetic works, this is most likely not\nfor you.\nMapping the City at Somerset House.\nUntil 15th\nFebruary.

Clearly unless something\nis done the same situation is likely to\nrecur next year too.\n\u201cThe School is working urgently\nJust what\nfunding is\navailable\nfor clinical\nstudents?\nNHS student bursaries are\navailable to students on preregistration health professional\ntraining courses,which include\nstudents in their ifth or sixth\nyear of studying medicine.A fees-only bursary from the NHS covers\ntuition fees,and these are paid\ndirectly to the university,much\nlike Student Finance pay for any\nother home or EU undergradu-ate's tuition fees.Students do\nnot have to pay this back.The\nNHS also has an\u201cextra weeks\u201d\nallowance,that provides \u00a3107 per\nweek when academic years are\nlonger than 30 weeks (excluding\nholidays).\nFor living costs,the government\nmaintenance loan available for\ncurrent ifth year students is\n\u00a33,263,and for inal year students\nis \u00a32,498.This isn't means tested.\nThere is also an additional bur-sary available that is allocated to\nstudents based on the income of\ntheir family home.Students in\nboth years can claim up to \u00a35,868.\nMedical students in their clinical\nyears are not eligible for Imperial's own bursary scheme,which\nis described on the Imperial website as\u201cOne of the most generous\nof all UK Universities.\u201d\nImperial has recently altered its\nbursary scheme for the 2015 academic intake,although not without controversy.After announcing the initial plans to award\nmore money to students from\nhigher income households,at the\nexpense of those who come from\nhouseholds that have less money,\nImperial College Union Council\ndenounced the alterations as\n\u201cAnti-Robin Hood.\u201d\nDespite this outcry,students\nstarting Imperial in 2015 from\nlow-income families are still eligible to receive \u00a36,000 in bursary\nalone for the irst four years of\ntheir degree.When factoring in\nmaintenance loans and grants,\nthe maximum amount of money\nstudents could receive exceeds\n\u00a315,000,despite Imperial also\nstating that undergraduates\nshould expect to live off \u00a311,223\n(for a 39-week long academic\nyear).\nThe maximum students can\ntherefore claim in loans and bur-sary funding is \u00a39,131 for those\nin ifth year,and \u00a38,366 for sixth\nyear students.\nwith the College and ICMSU and ICU\nto avoid this or at least minimise its\nimpact.\u201d\nThe results of the survey were\ncollected and analysed by Jennifer\nWatson, a fifth year medical student\nherself, and the current ICSMSU\nWelfare Officer.\nJennifer told Felix why she set the\nsurvey up in the first place: \u201cI started\nlooking into the situation after\nseveral of the welfare cases that came\nforward during the summer were\nrelated to financial worries.\n\u201cI was basically shocked by what I\nfound. I admit, when I read through\nall the results, I cried a little going\nthrough the free text responses.\u201d\nICSMSU President, Dariush\nHassanzadeh-Baboli, spoke to Felix\nabout how the survey\u2019s findings may\nresonate with all medical students,\nnot just those at Imperial. Said\nDariush: \u201cJennie has put in a huge\namount of effort into gathering this\ninformation. Clearly it is a big issue\nnot only for ICSM students, but\nmedical students nationwide.\n\u201cThe lack of funding in the final\ntwo years of med school is very\nconcerning, particularly as the work\nload increases dramatically and time\nto earn some extra cash dwindles\nsignificantly.\n\u201cWe hope to see some rapid changes\nin the very near future.\u201d\nOne of the main Medical School Campuses is Charing Cross Hospital.

But how far are we\nfrom any of these ideas becoming\nreality? In Ex Machina audiences\nare supposed to believe that the\nartificially intelligent character, Ava,\nhas a sense of self. Young programmer\nCaleb is asked to test Ava\u2019s\nconsciousness and reveals that Ava\nis a bonafide intelligent huminoid\ncapable of feeling emotions. The\nsuffering she later experiences in\nthe film evokes within us a sense of\ninjustice; if she has a consciousness\nsurely she should be entitled to\nfreedom?\nAlex Garland, the director of ExMachina, was inspired by Imperial\nProfessor Murray Shanahan\u2019s\nbook: \u201cEmbodiment and the Inner\nLife: Cognition and Consciousness\nin the Space of Plausible Minds\u201d.\nShanahan\u2019s research at Imperial looks\ninto how the human brain function\ncould be used in the field of artificial\nintelligence (AI). \u201cI am interested in\ntrying to understand how cognition is\nrealised in the brain. To do this I build\ncomputer models, which are typically\nsimulations of large numbers of\nneurones organised in a complex\nnetwork,\u201d he says in an interview at\nImperial. After reading the progress\nin theory of consciousness detailed in\nShanahan\u2019s book, Garland contacted\nthe professor for advice on the\ntechnical aspects of his film.\nOrigins of Artificial\nIntelligence\nAI and machine learning\nalgorithms are surprisingly\nubiquitous in our everyday lives:\nGoogle\u2019s search predictions, mobile\nphone voice recognition systems\nsuch as Apple\u2019s Siri, driverless cars\nlike Tesla Motors\u2019 latest dual-motor\nModel S and even closer to home \u2013\nnumber plate recognition technology\nused for the London congestion\ncharge. However, we are still a long\nway off being able to use robots\ninstead of all-nighters to desperately\ncomplete our university coursework.\nThe progression of AI from the\npages of Isaac Asimov\u2019s science\nfiction stories to driverless cars\nall started in the 1950s with Alan\nTuring, a British mathematician and\ninfamous WWII codebreaker. It was\nTuring who first posed the question\nof whether machines could think,\ndeveloping the Turing test, which\ndetermines how close a machine\u2019s\nbehaviour is to that of a human. It is\nthis that forms the basis for the plot\nof the film Ex-Machina.\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s\nMarvin Minsky, an American\ncognitive scientist, became a leading\nthinker in the field and co-founded\nthe Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) shortly after\nTuring died in 1954. Similar to\nProfessor Shanahan, Minsky was\nscientific advisor to director Stanley\nKubrick on the 1968 science fiction\nfilm \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d\nwhich brought audiences the AI\ncalled HAL9000 aboard spacecraft\nDiscovery One.\nAfter what was termed an \u201cAI\nwinter\u201d between the 1970s and\n1990s, when funding was cut short\nas governments favoured more\nproductive industries, the 21st\ncentury saw the advancement of AI\ntechnology, albeit in less obvious\nways than human lookalike robots.\nNowadays, AI research is focused\nmore on behind the scene uses such\nas logistics, data mining and medical\ndiagnosis. One crazy example is\nin Japan where an AI has been\nnominated as a board member in a\nventure capital firm as it can predict\nmarket trends faster than its human\nassociates. AI is also being used in\nthe defence industry, with South\nKorean forces now using Samsung\nSGR-1 armed sentry robots to patrol\nthe boarder with North Korea, and in\nIraq and Afghanistan.\nThere have also been advances in\nrobots that can develop and show\nemotions. Nao, a robot developed\nby the French robotics company\nAldebaran, is being used as a robotic\nteacher in universities and schools\nacross the UK. The uncannily human-looking robot stands two feet tall and\ncan be programmed to listen, see,\nspeak, touch and react. If you search\n\u2018Nao robot\u2019 on YouTube you can\neven see troops of them programmed\nto dance in sync with the pop-hit\nGangnam Style. Their abilities extend\nfar beyond the dancefloor however,\nand they can even form bonds with\nthe people they meet \u2013 depending on\nhow they are treated. The longer they\ninteract with someone, the more Nao\nlearns the person\u2019s moods and the\nstronger the bond becomes.\nGrowing concerns\nThe usefulness of these\ntechnologies, with their capacity\nto continually learn from the data\nthey collect, is making it ever harder\nto imagine a future without AI.\nIncreasing dependence on these\nmachines has sparked some concerns,\nwith even Stephen Hawking warning\nof the perils of AI, saying in an\ninterview with the Independent:\n\u201cThe development of full artificial\nintelligence could spell the end of\nthe human race ... humans, who are\nlimited by slow biological evolution,\ncouldn\u2019t compete, and would be\nsuperseded.\u201d The technological\nsingularity hypothesis represents this\nview that continued progress in the\ndevelopment of AI will ultimately\ncause the end of humanity as its\npower exceeds mankind\u2019s intellectual\ncapacity to control.\nIf you follow popular culture ss a\nguide to AI, then we really should be\nterrified. Most fictitious depictions\nof a future where humans and robots\nco-exist picture bleak apocalyptic\nscenarios, ranging from robotic\nconspiracies to take over the world\nin I-Robot to the dystopian Earth\ndepicted in the film Blade Runner\nwhere robotic \u2018replicants\u2019 have\nspiralled out of human control.\nWhatever your stance on the future\nof AI, its progress since the 1950s has\nshowcased the incredible capacity of\nhumanity\u2019s own intelligence. It has\ncertainly helped advance sectors such\nas medicine, defence and business.\nBut how long it will take to create\nrobots that have consciousness is still\ndebated. Shanahan comments on\nthe topic saying \u201cthe Robotics side of\nthings \u2013 Ava\u2019s body \u2013 we can get to\nin 10 or 15 years I think ... but Ava\u2019s\nconsciousness requires a couple of\nconceptual breakthroughs before\nwe get there\u201d. Therefore despite\nsubstantial progress we are still far\nfrom making the ideas portrayed in\nGarland\u2019s film a reality, though it\u2019s\ncertainly not impossible.\nNao robots showing what they're made of Photo: Aalto\nUniversity\n\"the director\nof ExMachina\nwas inspired\nby Imperial\nProfessor\nMurray\nShanahan\u2019s\nbook\"\n\n"

Based on a Marvel comic of\nthe same name, Walt Disney has\nlaunched a sort-of independent\nouting of superheroes who are not\nlinked to the Marvel Cinematic\nUniverse in any way.\nSet in San Fransokyo, a mixture\nof, you guessed it, Tokyo and San\nFrancisco, we meet the young Hiro\n(Ryan Potter), who is obsessed with\nhis robot and participating in fight\nclubs to win a considerable amount of\ncash. His small but ingenious creation\nis one hell of a skilled fighter, and\neven from this young age Hiro shows\npromise for the robotics. His older\nbrother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) and\nhis team of fellow robot scientists,\nGoGo (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon\nWayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis\nRodriguez) and Fred (T. J. Miller),\nall serve as an inspiration for Hiro\u2019s\nfurther development in the field of\nrobotics.\nBut a mysterious fire and\nsubsequent explosion leaves Tadashi\ndead, plus an important part of Hiro\u2019s\nwork stolen by a masked villain\nwho intends on mass destruction.\nThe identity of the bad guy is not\ndifficult to suss out, but for a film\naimed mainly at children to attempt\nan intricate plot twist demonstrates\nan admirable addition of originality\ninto what otherwise would have\nbeen a straightforward plot. It also\nputs a very human face onto who is\nfinally revealed to be behind all the\ndestruction, which adds a surprising\nlayer of a smart background story to\nthe overall plot.\nIn order to defeat this powerful\nantagonist, Hiro is going to need all\nthe help he can get. And aside from\nhis older brother\u2019s team of science\ngeeks who undergo impressive\ntransformations to superheroes\nin their own right, all based on the\nvarious experiments and gadgets\nthey were each working on initially,\na crucial member of the team\ncomes from Baymax, an inflatable\nhealthcare companion, and a project\nTadashi was working on before his\npassing.\nBeing a robot there is a limitation\nplaced on how closely Baymax\ncan interact and empathise with\neveryone, and a bulk of the film\u2019s\nhumour comes from the awkward\nmisunderstandings that take place\nin the early process of Baymax\nintegrating with the rest of the\nhumans.\nWhen the gang gets together the\nfilm knows just the right kind of\nfun to have with these fun, vibrant\ncharacters. The diversity in the use of\ncolours further injects some much-needed light-hearted entertainment\nand the pace with which the narrative\nmoves is a healthy one. The film very\nrarely slows its pace down, and it\nhardly finds the need to do so. There\nis an immediate sense of a well-functioning team, all equipped with\nclever skillsets, coming together to do\ntheir part in saving San Fransokyo.\nThe only weak link comes in\nthe end. Rather than ending on a\npoignant, thought-provoking note,\nit chooses to take the easy way out\n\u2013 admittedly a happier version of\nthe available options, since there has\nbeen a significant death in the plot\nalready. But it makes certain aspects\nof the film seem less consequential.\nBut even that cannot stop Big Hero 6\nfrom being an absolute triumph of an\nanimated feature, a bold, action and\nhumour-packed ride.\nBIG HERO 6\nDirectors: Don Hall, Chris\nWilliams\nScreenplay: Jordan Roberts,\nDaniel Gerson, Robert L.

But there is a certain\nlevel of intrigue and fun to be had\nin trying to follow and keep up with\neverything that is going on in this\nover-crowded crime drama that\nechoes the great Hollywood neo-noirs.\nEven from the get-go Inherent\nVice has a different feel to it. The\nsound and cinematography both feel\noutdated, surely a deliberate move\nto add that extra touch of an old-school feel to the film. We start with\na warning and a cry for help. Shasta\n(Katherine Waterston) visits her ex-boyfriend, private investigator Larry\n\u2018Doc\u2019 Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix),\nand informs him of a plot to have\nwealthy real estate developer Mickey\nWolfmann (Eric Roberts), her current\nboyfriend, institutionalised by his\nwife Sloane Wolfmann (Serena Scott\nThomas) and her lover whose identity\nis not known.

Photo: Ben Howitt\nBen Howitt attends this\nterm\u2019s Refresher\u2019s Fair.\nOn Wednesday 28th\nJanuary, the\nUnion\u2019s annual Refresher\u2019s\nFair was held in the Great\nHall. The event featured 24 clubs,\nsocieties and projects, ranging from\nRCC Synchro to ACC Tennis and A&E\nDramatic Society.\nThe event was also attended by a\nnumber of Imperial\u2019s services and\nexternal companies, including Image\nScotland and Nandos.\nFrom conversations with those\nattending, the main takeaway from\nthe event appears to be that while the\nevent was in general well organised,\nthe lack of publicity meant that\nattendance from current students was\nextremely poor, rendering the point\nof the day \u2013 to recruit new members \u2013\nless than effective.\nWhen asked about how the day\nhad gone Abi De Bruin, the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies), said \u201cit\u2019s\ngood to see so much engagement from\nstudent volunteers\u201d.\nThe event was indeed well attended\nby societies, with spaces in fact\nrunning out fairly quickly. A number\nof new clubs and societies attended,\nincluding Vehicle Design, Lib Youth\nand Imperial Obstacle Course Racing\n(IOCR).\nLib Youth seemed dissatisfied,\nplacing the blame on the marketing\nof the Fair, and claiming that they\nhad \u201cwasted the day\u201d. By contrast,\nIOCR had a pleasant experience,\nhaving benefited extensively from\ntheir location at the Fair: directly\nnext to Nandos.\nThe Nandos stand was, arguably,\nthe runaway star of the day, featuring\n\u2013 in addition to their normal offers \u2013\na \u2018Wheel\u2019o\u2019Chilli\u2019 and a large chicken\ncostume.\nDespite this, Abi made a fair\npoint with regards to student\nengagement. Many of the volunteers\nI spoke to over the day seemed\npositive, outgoing, and enthusiastic.\nRecruitment for incoming committee\nmembers was proceeding well too,\nwith numerous first years attending\nto represent their new societies.\nIt is possible that attendance was\nlimited owing to the fact that exam\nseason had only just finished, or to a\nlack of society publicity \u2013 certainly,\nthere was less social media presence\nthan the Fresher\u2019s Fair at the\nbeginning of the year.\nHowever, there seems to have been\na breakdown in communication.\nMany people, when asked, were\nunaware that the event even existed,\nThe New Acivities Committee has\nmade no less than 25 new clubs\nand societies so far this year,with\nmore midway through the process.\nHere\u2019s the irst of the new\nstudent groups to be agitating for\nyour attention at any opportunity.\nIf you don't see what you want\nhere or on the Union website,\nwhy not create it? There will be an\narticle next week on how societies\nget created.\nMedecin Sans Frontieres\nMSF society is a group to raise\nawareness,debates and fundraising\nregarding the work that the charity\n(Medicines Sans Frontieres) does.\nThere are a number of members\nfrom medicine and other courses.\nThis term,we are hosting the\nNational MSF Conference\u2013the\nHumanitarian Forum at Imperial\non March 21st\nthis year.We had\na fundraiser last week with\nmusic,comedy,a raffle and other\nentertainment which raised \u00a31000.\nFor the third year running,we are\norganising the annual MSF London\nFunrun\u2013last year raising \u00a37000.\nVehicle Design\nVehicle Design is a society that aims\nto give students the opportunity to\nbe creative with their ideas for new\nand innovative vehicular technology.\nIt acts as a platform,supporting\nstudent led projects and providing\nan environment in which any\ndesign,however big or small,may be\nimplemented.\nStarting last term,we already have\nthree major projects underway: the\nCubeSat Project,the EcoMarathon,\nand the Solar Challenge.This term,\nwe will be really making headway\nas the projects begin to gain\nmomentum.\nEmpower\nEmpower is the female support\nnetwork that aims to foster\nprofessional skill development\nwhilst promoting self-conidence\nand wellbeing.\nComing up this term are Percept\u2013a\nsafe space for men to discuss gender\nequality in a non-confrontational\ngroup,and the WomeninScience\ncampaign,to raise awareness of\nfemale scientists.\nFinally,we have BeautifulBeings,\na campaign which tackles the\nportrayal of women in the media\nand aims to shift the focus towards\nachievements over\u201cblemishes\u201d.\nTandem\nWe are a society for both men and\nwomen,which aims to work with\nbusinesses and Imperial College\nLondon to promote awareness of\ngender equality in the workplace.\nWe want to help students\nunderstand that it is no longer a\n\u201cfemale issue\u201dbut an issue which\nconcerns us all.\nThis term we will be launching\nour web presence.We will also be\nconducting a number of interviews\non gender equality,and hosting\na panel discussion in March with\nrepresentatives from various\ndifferent industries.\nand fewer knew that it was taking\nplace on the Wednesday.\nIt is a shame that this opportunity\nto promote student activity was so\npoorly attended, and I hope that more\nefforts are made in the future.\nCSPB, though, and this clause is up for\ndiscussion.\nFunding is also given out by\nICTrust to assist students in attending\nconferences to present their research.\nThis is more useful to the Graduate\nStudents\u2019 Union, and to individual\nstudents, but Departmental Societies\nget a look in too.\nPerhaps more tantalising is the\nExploration Board, which takes as\nits mission statement \u201cto support\nprojects that reach a balance between\nstraightforward scientific research\nand an adventurous holiday.\u201d More\nspecifically, it funds expeditions\nwith scientific merit, with recent\ndestinations including Mongolia, Peru\nand Svalbard.\nThe board has recognised 98\nexpeditions since its creation in 1955.\nOver a third of these took place in\n2001-2010, after a quiet few decades\nstarting in the 1970s.\nSport/Arts Imperial\nMany clubs, particularly those in the\nACC, compete in BUCS tournaments,\nfor which extensive funding is\nawarded by Sport Imperial. Funding\nis also allocated in a second round to\nnon-BUCS sports with benefit to the\nCollege.\nA similar scheme, Arts Imperial,\nruns to assist the various performing\narts societies on campus, as well as\nto administrate the Blyth centre,\nwhich provides practice facilities\nfor instrumentalists at the College.\nThe funding available from Arts\nImperial is significantly less, owing to\nthe increased difficulty in obtaining\nsponsorship for clubs not competing\non a weekly basis.\nDepartments\nAs well as money from the College,\na number of societies (particularly\nDepartmental societies) get funding\ndirectly from their departments. This\nusually takes the form of subsidy for a\nspecific event, like an alumni dinner.\nDepartments can also help out clubs\nby offering room space for meetings.\nSelf Generated Income\nPerhaps the principle method of\nobtaining cash to run activities comes\nunder the admittedly broad title of\n\u2018Self Generated Income\u2019 (SGI).\nThis can take the form of ticket\nsales, membership fees, sponsorship\narrangements, or simple donations\nfrom alumni or generous members of\nthe public.\nIf your club has found a clever way of\nraising money for activity, get in touch at\nfelix.clubsandsocieties@ic.ac.uk\nNew clubs\nthis term\n\n"

When\nyou take out the bar and retail outlets,\nas well as staffing, overheads etc, that\nleaves approximately \u00a31.4 million\nrunning through the clubs\u2019 coffers on\na yearly basis \u2013 as reported last year at\nbudgeting.\nWith all of that cashflow, spread\nover 350 societies, you might\nreasonably ask where all of the money\ncomes from.\nImperial\u2019s Grant\nEach year, we are given around\n\u00a3330,000 by the Union to give out\nto clubs. The majority of this gets\nallocated during the Spring Term,\nonce everyone\u2019s had a chance to settle\ninto their roles.\nEach club Chair is expected to\nwrite a budget for the coming year,\nfactoring in cost and any other\nincome sources (including members\u2019\nown contributions). These budgets get\nlooked over by Management Group\nChairs and Treasurers and the DPCS/\nDPFS, before coming to a meeting\nof the Clubs, Societies and Projects\nBoard (CSPB).\nAfter three meetings, one to discuss\nany appeals or issues with budgets,\nbudgeting is complete \u2013 at least, that\u2019s\nthe aim. Some money is always kept\naside, for\u2026\nTop-ups\nIt\u2019s hard to plan your expenditure\nfor the next academic year when\nyou\u2019re halfway through it. There are\nunexpected breakages of equipment,\nnecessary purchases and other times\nwhen money has to be spent to keep a\nsociety running.\nMoney for contingency comes from\nthe Activities Development Board,\na subcommittee of CSPB. As of this\nyear, there is also money set aside for\nthe Activities Development Fund,\nwhich is intended to support new\nclubs that get created, and existing\nclubs looking to run new activities.\nHarlington\nThe Harlington Fund was created\nin 1989, to manage the funds from a\ngravel extraction at the Harlington\nplaying fields.\nTypically, there is around \u00a350,000\na year to be allocated for clubs\u2019 big\npurchases \u2013 things that are expensive\nenough that there\u2019s no way the Union\ncould subsidise.\nHarlington is based around\nimproving student activity in the\nlong term, and its guidelines ensure\nthat the money goes to good use.\n\u201cAs a general principle, funds\nwill only be used to finance new or\nimproved facilities, namely capital\nassets or equipment, and not to meet\nrunning costs.\u201d\nThe principles also rule out,\nin general, funding for students\u2019\npersonal equipment and for\nexpeditions, so that funding has a\nlong term impact.\nThe board on the committee\nconsists of the Vice Provost\n(Education) (Debra Humphris),\na past President of ICU (Ashley\nBrown) and the current Union\nPresident (Tom Wheeler).\n\u00a360,000 funding was awarded\nlast year out of \u00a3100,000 worth of\napplications. After the first term,\nthere is \u00a340,000 left in the pot for\nthis year, although the applications\nalready received would, if all were\napproved, take the fund into negative.\nProjects funded by Harlington\nhave included the purchase of\nmicrophones, new equipment for\nclubs in their early stages, and\nreplacement of sports kit.\nIn January 2014 a one-off spike\nin funding was also awarded for the\nredevelopment of the Union Concert\nHall, to the tune of \u00a3215,000.\nIC Trust\nImperial College Trust (formerly\nQueen\u2019s Gate Trust) is an\nindependent charity. A bit like\nthe ADB (see Top-ups), it provides\nfunding at various points over the\nyear to promote charitable work\nand fund research connected to the\nsubjects taught at College. It\u2019s split\ninto three main categories: Tours,\nConferences and the Exploration\nBoard.\nThe main way that societies see\nIC Trust money is through the\ntours funding that gets handed out\nonce a term by CSPB. This is used\nto fund the travel to and from club\ntours, usually with around 20 tours\nin a period (Autumn, Spring and\nSummer).\nThere are some fairly specific\nrules on the allocation for tours; for\ninstance, if your club runs the same\ntrip to the same place every year, you\nare expected to budget for it in the\nannual Grant. In previous years, there\nhas also been a rule that a society can\nonly submit one tour application in a\nperiod. The policy is under review by\nThe Exploration Board funds expeditions with scientific and recreational benefit. Photo: Gemma Milman\nBen Howitt explains\nwhere, how and why\nclubs get the money\nthey do.\nHack\u2019s Corner\n(How to Write a\nbudget)\nFor the irst year in a little while,CSPB has a\nbudgeting strategy.The weird exceptions that pop\nup year on year (you know who you are!) have been\ndiscussed.Before budgeting closes on Sunday,here\nare a few pointers on making sure your budget is\nreadable,realistic and effective.\nFirstly,make sure that all of the funding you are\nrequesting is explicitly linked to your core aims and\nobjectives\u2013subsidy is not available for anything else.\nA balanced budget should contain a mix of CSPB-A,\nCSPB-B and CSPB-C.Remember that CSPB-A is for\ncore,essential items only\u2013and that illegitimate A\nitems may well be moved straight to CSPB-C.There\nis a budgeting policy to follow,meaning that CSPB-B\nfunding will be available in the second round.\nIt's important that your sums make sense\u2013and\nall budget lines should have,at the end of the\ndescription,a 1 sentence sum summarising the cost\nand subsidy requested,e.g.\u201c5peoplex3tripsx\u00a330@\n40%subsidy=\u00a3180\u201d.\nAs regards subsidy,be as realistic as you can.Look\nat what was granted last year,and base the estimate\non that.While 75% subsidy on accommodation\nwould be lovely,it's just not going to happen.\nAlso,remember that your budget should\napproximately balance\u2013so your predicted income,\nmembership fees,sponsorship and subsidy should\nroughly match the expected cost.There are obviously\nexceptions to this related to ticket sales,but as far\nas possible try to explain where the non-subsidised\nincome will be coming from.\nFor expensive activities,or especially busy clubs,\nit is worth mentioning activities that you don't\nsubsidise,to highlight all of the costs you have as a\nsociety.These should appear in your budget lines,\nas it gives CSPB information on the cost to your\nmembers during club activity.\nThe DPFS is always watching.

After her dramatic\nescape from the arena at the end\nof the previous film, Katniss\nis now forced to choose where\nher loyalties lie \u2013 to protect her\nfamily, or to become something\nmore: to become the Mockingjay.\nAfter that, it\u2019s time for David\nAyer\u2019s scorching war film Fury.\nSet in the last days of the war,\nit follows Logan Lerman as\nNorman Ellison, a new recruit\ninto Brad Pitt\u2019s tank crew. As\nthe Allies push onwards into\nGermany, Norman is forced to\nquestion his moral code \u2013 are\nthe Germans really as evil as he\u2019s\nbeen taught to believe?\nMockingjay: 18:30 Tuesday 3rd\nFebruary and 21:15 Thursday 5th\nFebruary.\nFury: 21:00 Tuesday 3rd\nFebruary and 18:30 Thursday 5th\nFebruary.\nTickets are \u00a33 for members, \u00a34\nfor non-members, or \u00a35/7 for a\ndouble bill.\nMalone) is searching for her missing\nhusband Coy (Owen Wilson), a\nsaxophone player who mysteriously\ndisappeared. Somehow these cases are\nall interlinked.\nHaving seen the film, it is still\nnot 100% clear as to how this is\nthe case. But as more supporting\ncharacters drift in and out of the\nfilm\u2019s narrative, the audience gets to\nsee that there is an overlying big story\nthat somehow connects everything\nand everyone.\nDoc\u2019s investigation leads to all\nsorts of weird and wonderful places\nand also to confusing clues that go\nwith them \u2013 the DA\u2019s office where\nhis lover Penny Kimball (Reese\nWitherspoon) gives some sound\nadvice, a brothel, a mysterious boat, a\ndrug trafficking plot, and a dentist\u2019s\noffice (huh?) all feature in his search\nfor the truth. It soon becomes clear\nthat it is not just about discovering\nwho is behind the crime that matters,\nbut the why as well.\nThere are some quality\nperformances to feast your eyes on.\nPhoenix gives the role his all, as the\nmildly eccentric, but entirely capable\nPI hopped up on a never-ending\nsupply of cannabis among other\nrecreational drugs, and the tough,\nmacho Josh Brolin rocks up in the\nrole of LAPD Detective Christian\n\u2018Bigfoot\u2019 Bjornsen to constantly lock\nhorns with Doc, in a performance to\nbe remembered. Martin Short also\ndeserves praise for his incredibly\nbrief but hysterical turn as a highly\ndisturbing dentist who preys on the\nyoung, helpless patients he is referred.\nAnderson is in no rush to get\nanywhere with solving the mystery.\nHe takes his time to chill out every\nnow and again and have a laugh\nwith his cast of quirky actors, and\nsome brutally honest third-person\nnarration. It is a film that will often\ntest your patience, but it does not\npromise high rewards either. So you\nbe the judge. Love it or hate it, this is\nAnderson doing what he does best.\ndoing once he gets out after serving\nhis time? The escape goes smoothly,\nbut things are far from over for those\nnow on the run from the law. It all\nseems like a pretty great, glamorous\nlife to begin with. The criminal life\ndoes indeed have its perks. Shady\nlawyers make it possible to move\nmoney and weapons around, as well\nas providing a more than comfortable\nplace for them all to stay. There are\ntrust issues however, and loyalties are\ntested as time goes by.\nMaking matters more complicated\nis the introduction of a love interest,\nprobably the least well-written\n2015 Screen Actors Guild\ncharacter in the entire film. Tasha\n(Alicia Vikander) and JR form an\nincomprehensibly close bond in a\nvery short period of time, one that\nis forced upon the characters for the\nsake of the story having something\nelse to concentrate on. Despite the\ntalented young actors that they are,\nboth Thwaites and Vikander cannot\nsell the blind romance that motivates\nthese young characters, mostly\nbecause they have very little to go on.\nEverything remains very small in\nscale. The prison breakout scene, and\nfurther action scenes that are shown\nare done so with minimal flashy\neffects and with as much focus paid to\nspending less. It is a welcome change\nfrom regularly seeing everything\ngo up in flames, with sequences\nappearing tighter, more intimate and\ncharacter-driven.\nMcGregor keeps his act ambiguous\nthroughout, being the supportive\nmentor figure when the situation\ncalls for it, but at times letting his\nfiery temper and inclination towards\nviolence take over, showing the\nside that most possibly landed him\nin trouble in the first place. He is a\nfrightening, dominating force not to\nbe taken lightly, and has no problem\nwhipping the young Thwaites into\nshape.\nIt is about always staying one step\nahead of the game; trying to break\nfree from the toxic clutches of a\ncriminal whilst also surviving to live\nto tell the tale.\nWhether the power couple succeeds\nor not in doing this is hardly a\nmystery, but the way they go about\nputting one up on Brendan is a touch\non the flimsy side. It tries to end on\na slick, smart note but there is too\nlittle of either qualities for it to be\nconsidered a satisfactory finish, but\noverall there is tense fun to be had.\nPhoto: Julius Avery, Hopscotch Films Photo: Julius Avery, Hopscotch Films\nWinner: Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture \u2013\nBirdman (Andrea Riseborough, Emma Stone, Amy Ryan, Naomi Watts,\nEdward Norton, Michael Keaton)\nWinner: Outstanding Performance\nby a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n\u2013 Eddie Redmayne\nWinner: Outstanding Performance\nby a Female Actor in a Leading\nRole \u2013 Julianne Moore\nWinner: Outstanding Performance\nby a Male Actor in a Supporting\nRole \u2013 J.K.

The\ncollection saw a re-vamped version\nof the classic Chanel tweed suit, with\nlong midi length pencil or A-line\ntulle skirts, complete with matching\ncropped jackets.\nLagerfeld also opted for explosions\nof pastel coloured sequins, with one\nof the finale looks incorporating\nblack and pink rosettes on a sequin\nembellished midi skirt, with a\nmatching pink sequin cropped\nbustier.\nThe accessory of choice featured\nthroughout the show was the hat -either large brimmed straw styles\nenveloped in rich dark coloured\ntulles, or beanies embroidered with\nsequins and chiffon flowers, some\nof them with retro black net veils.\nIndeed, Lagerfeld has managed to\nre-define the beanie and showcase it\nas a luxe couture item. No doubt the\nlikes of Zara and H&M will be rushing\nto re-create the look soon, which is set\nto be a staple new look in the fashion\nworld. Lagerfeld\u2019s creative direction\nunder the hefty Chanel name make\nhis designs desirable and oft imitated,\nwith fashion lovers and retailers alike\ndisplaying a strong urge to channel\nhis looks. For example, last year\u2019s\nhaute couture fashion show saw the\nemergence of the couture trainers\ntrend. All of the models wore pastel\ncoloured trainers with jewelled\naccents, sequin embellishments or\nlace details. The trend soon became a\nhuge success, with labels such as Nike\nand Uggs attempting to re-create the\nluxury sporty look.\nIn addition to introducing the luxe\nbeanie, cropped tops and cropped\nbolero jackets featured heavily\nthroughout the show. Lagerfeld even\nclaimed, \u201cThe new cleavage is the\nstomach.\u201d It looks like the mid-riff\ntrend is here to stay for a while.\nThe overarching floral theme even\nsaw huge 3-D floral embroideries\nat the bottom of coats or across\nshoulders on jackets. Lagerfeld called\nthe show \u201cthe flower women of the\n21st\ncentury.\u201d Although the theme\nof the show was jovial and colourful,\nit was conceived with the intention\nof appeasing the sombre mood in\nParis as of late. Lagerfeld felt that the\ntheme was important in light of the\nrecent terror attacks targeting writers\nof the Charlie Hebdo magazine in\nParis. Lagerfeld told interviewers\n\u201cespecially after this dark, awful\nbeginning to the year there was\nsomething like this needed...there\u2019s\nsomething about flowers.\u201d Lagerfeld\nalso remarked that he is lucky to\nbe sheltered by the fashion world,\nadding, \u201cI\u2019m lucky... I live in a very\nprotected world [in fashion]. I can\nkeep something like a dream reality\nbut it\u2019s not a reality of daily life.\u201d\nThe show truly pushed boundaries\nin terms of new trends in the couture\nworld, including too-long black\npatent belts draped all the way the\nlengths of the long skirts.\nAs usual, the finale look of the\nshow saw a model paraded down the\ncatwalk in a wedding gown, and this\ntime she was not heavily pregnant,\nas the bridal model was for last year\u2019s\nshow. The dress\u2019 long trailing skirt\nwas swathed in white and subtly\npale pink tulle rosettes, giving it a\nstiff quality. In contrast, the top of\nthe dress was a simple white peplum\nshape with cap sleeves. The bridal\nmodel was followed by the male\nmodels featured at the beginning of\nthe show, carrying large bouquets of\ncolourful roses behind her, a quirky\nalternative to traditional flower girls.\nThe shows of Paris haute couture\nweek had a decidedly fearless\nundercurrent to them. Raf Simons,\nthe creative director of Dior, made a\nlink between the spirit of the couture\nworkers in the ateliers and the proud\nprotestors on the streets after the\nParis attacks. The underlying message\nof the week was simple: vive the Paris\nfashion houses and vive la France!\n\"Lagerfeld\nhas\nmanaged to\nre-define\nthe beanie\"\nAbove: model showcases one of the finale looks of the Chanel spring/\nsummer 2015 haute couture show.

    "content": "24 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n30.01.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBritish author Zadie Smith, whose work has b\nIndira Mallik analyses\nthe divide between the\nhave and have-nots, and\nBritain\u2019s arts class war\n\u2018Male, Pale,\n& Stale?\u2019\nLast week, the unlikeliest of\narguments took place. The\nparticipants: the somewhat\npass\u00e9 singer James Blunt and Labour\u2019s\nnew culture secretary Chris Bryant.\nThe topic: diversity (or lack thereof)\nin the British arts sector. Bryant\nsparked the row when, in his first\ninterview since becoming shadow\nculture secretary, he addressed the\n\u201ccultural drought\u201d facing Britain\noutside of London and the south-east\ndue to a lack of funding. If elected, he\nsaid, Labour would work to encourage\nthe arts world to hire from people\nfrom a variety of backgrounds.\nCrossed-words might have been\navoided had he not added \u201cI am\ndelighted that Eddie Redmayne won\n[a Golden Globe for best actor for The\nTheory of Everything], but we can\u2019t just\nhave a culture dominated by Eddie\nRedmayne and James Blunt and\ntheir ilk,\u201d referencing the actor and\nthe singer\u2019s privileged backgrounds\n\u2013 Eddie Redmayne was educated at\nEton and Blunt at Harrow. Blunt\nhit back with an open letter to Chris\nBryant, accusing the MP of \u201ctelling\nworking class people that posh people\nlike me don\u2019t deserve [success], and\nthat we must redress the balance.\u201d\nBlunt went on to say that Bryant was\npeddling an \u201cenvy-based\u201d agenda\nwhich promoted mediocrity in the\nname of diversity above merit. Chris\nBryant replied in a letter of his own\nsaying \u201cI\u2019m delighted you\u2019ve done\nwell for yourself\u2026 It is far tougher [to\nforge a career in the arts] if you come\nfrom a poor family where you have to\nhand over your holiday earnings to\nhelp pay the family bills.\u201d\nThis exchange, at times rather\nentertaining (Blunt intermittently\nrefers to Bryant with choice\nphrases such as \u201cclassist gimp\u201d and\n\u201cwazzock\u201d), has highlighted the\nneed for open and frank discussion\nabout the state of the arts in Britain.\nBryant is by no means the only one to\nvoice his opinions on the subject, in\nOctober, Jenny Sealey, who codirected\nthe 2012 Paralympic Opening\nCeremony and is now the Graeae\nTheatre Company\u2019s artistic director,\nstated that unless funding to projects\nsuch as the Access to Work scheme\n\u2013 which aims to provide funding\nto disabled and deaf people to hire\nsupport staff such as sign language\ninterpreters in order to carry on\nworking \u2013 is maintained, \u201ctheatre will\ngo back to being male, pale and stale\u201d.\nArts funding is where the\nboundaries between economics and\nculture have really clashed in these\ntimes of ever increasing austerity.\nCouncils all across England have\nseen their arts budgets slashed; in a\nparticularly dramatic case the council\nin Newcastle-upon-Tyne published\na draft three-year budget in 2012,\nwhich projected a cut to funding for\narts organisations of 100% effective\nfrom 2015. This would have meant\nthe closing of some of the country\u2019s\nmost respected institutions; The\nNorthern Stage, one of the top ten\nproducing theatres in the country;\nand Live Theatre, where Lee Hall,\nwriter of Billy Elliot, learnt his\ncraft). Though the council has gone\nahead, cutting its cultural budget\ncompletely, effective from April,\nthe arts in the city were saved by a\nlast minute intervention from then\nShadow Culture Secretary Harriet\nHarman who secured \u00a3600,000 a year\n(half the original budget) for a new\ncharitable Culture Investment Fund,\nto which arts organisations in the city\ncan apply for grants.\nWhile institutions can be saved last\nminute by politicians, individuals are\nrarely so lucky. Cuts in arts funding\nhas meant a loss of jobs, as well as a\nre-evaluation of ambitions for many\nyoung actors, directors, playwrights\nand technicians, who find themselves\nunable to pursue their craft because\nof falling wages. Last year, Academy\naward winner and veritable national\ntreasure Dame Judi Dench lamented\nthe fact that young actors are being\nsqueezed out of the profession,\nsaying \u201canyone who\u2019s in the theatre\ngets letters countless times a week\nasking for help to get through drama\nschool. You can do so much, but\nyou can\u2019t do an endless thing. It is\nvery expensive.\u201d Fellow actor David\nMorrissey has also spoken out, saying\nthat the arts is increasingly engaging\nin \u201can intern culture\u201d in which young\ngraduates are expected to work for\nfree in order to gain experience\nand valuable contacts within the\nindustry. This was backed up by a\nrecent report commissioned for Art\nCouncil England into diversity in\nthe arts, which found that \u201cthere are\nimportant diversity issues around\nwho is able to volunteer including the\nuse of unpaid internships as a way\nto gain experience.\u201d Furthermore,\nthe National Centre for Social\nResearch found that higher levels\nof volunteering were generally\nassociated with lower levels of\ndeprivation, indicating that unpaid\ninternships are the preserve of the\nmoneyed classes\nDavid Morrissey went on to say \u201cif\nI was starting out now, it would be a\nlot harder, because my parents could\nnever have supported me through\nthat \u2018Is it going to happen?\u2019 period\u201d.\nThe lack of opportunity to pursue\ntraining in a sustainable way is\npartly due to the demise of repertory\ntheatres due to arts funding cuts.\nAccording to Dame Judi, \u2018rep\u2019 theatre\nwas \u201cwhere you went to learn and\nmake your mistakes and watch people\nwho knew how to do it\u201d .\nThis is where the arguments\nof James Blunt and others, who\nthink that those with talent will\nfind a way to succeed no matter\nthe circumstances, fail. The fact is\nthat privilege acts on the likelihood\nof success in both subtle and sure\nways. No one will deny that the ever\ngrowing ranks of the public school old\nboys such as Benedict Cumberbatch,\nEddie Redmayne, Damien Lewis,\nDominic West and yes, even James\nBlunt, have had to work hard for their\nsuccess; no one is saying that they\ngot record deals or parts in movies\nbecause their chums from Eton or\nHarrow lobbied the big production\ncompanies. But young actors and\nmusicians and artists from their\nbackground are given the opportunity\nto fail, to work for little or no money,\nthe time to hone their craft safe in the\nknowledge that they will not starve.\nThis opportunity is rarely afforded to\ntheir working class counterparts, who\nmay have to work 40 hours to make\nends meet and then practice their art\nin the evenings.\nThe tragedy is that the British arts\nestablishment is going backwards\nin terms of representing the society\nas a whole as a direct consequence\nof the economic downturn. Julie\nWalters, who is from a working class\nbackground, recently said that she\nworried that \u201cthe way things are now,\nthere aren\u2019t going to be any working\nclass actors. I look at almost all the\nup-and-coming names and they\u2019re\nfrom the posh schools.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong ... they\u2019re\nwonderful\u201d, the actress added, \u201cit\u2019s\njust a shame those working-class\nkids aren\u2019t coming through. When\nI started, 30 years ago, it was the\ncomplete opposite.\u201d\n\"The fact\nis, privilege\nacts on the\nlikelihood\nof success in\nboth subtle\nand sure\nways\"\n\"Young\nartists from\nprivileged\nbackgrouds\nare given the\nopportunity\nto fail\"\nEton-educated Eddie Redmayne, winner of this year's Golden Globe for\nBest Actor.

Photo: stereogum.com\nTwee is a word often used to\ndescribe Stuart Murdoch\u2019s\nindie band, whose ninth album\nGirls in Peacetime Want to Dance was\nreleased on Matador on 19th\nJanuary.\nHowever having listened to the\nalbum a number of times since it was\nreleased one is immediately forced to\nconsider whether this label still holds\ntrue.\nBelle & Sebastian has developed\nsignificantly since 1999\u2019s Tigermilk,\nthe most startling change being in\n2010\u2019s Write About Love where the\nemotional and sombre ballads of\ntheir earlier works were lost. That\nalbum marked a turning point for the\nband as it became more electronic,\nmore upbeat, and more happy; yet\nfelt unfinished as if the band did not\nknow where it was going.\nMany critics have cited this as a\n\u2018reinvention\u2019 of the band \u2013 I disagree.\nWhilst this new album places a heavy\nfocus on love and relationships (like\npractically all their other works), the\nstories told in the lyrics feel more\nmature and question the world we are\nin, rather than who we are.\nThrowing in the political anger\nprevalent in a number of the tracks,\nand combined with the direction\ntaken by Write About Love, it becomes\napparent that the band is growing up,\nmoving from the adolescent nature of\ntheir earlier releases to stories about\nthe lives of twentysomethings.\nThis is by no means a criticism.\nWhilst the enjoyment of the band\u2019s\nolder works is unaffected by their\nrecent dramatic direction change, the\nlistener can observe vastly different\nemotions behind the storylines in\nwhat is presented to them today\nversus (for example) the band\u2019s\noutstanding If You\u2019re Feeling Sinister.\nThe album feels far more\napproachable than Belle and\nSebastian\u2019s earlier releases, and\nthis is likely thanks to the much\nwider range of musical influences\npresent in the tracks.Gospel makes\na welcome appearance in \u2018Nobody\u2019s\nEmpire\u2019, and a strong theme of dance\nruns through the album. Artists\nsuch as Metronomy, Orchestral\nManoeuvres In The Dark and New\nOrder come to mind through slight\nsimilarities in the music.\nThe band did put out three singles\nprior to the January release \u2013 \u2018The\nParty Line\u2019, \u2018Nobody\u2019s Empire\u2019, and\n\u2018The Cat With the Cream\u2019 \u2013 all songs\nthat lend far more closely to Belle\n& Sebastian albums of old than\nthis new album as a whole. Because\nof this I reach the only criticism I\nfeel appropriate \u2013 it does not flow, a\nstartling disappointment considering\nhow well constructed earlier releases\nare.\nUltimately, this does not take\naway from the absolute pleasure of\nlistening to Girls in Peacetime Want to\nDance. Murdoch again demonstrates\nhis excellent ability to craft lyrical\npoetry, and the score \u2013 whilst less\ncinematic than earlier works \u2013\nemotionally moves you in the way\npeople have come to expect from the\nGlaswegian band.\nYet, the album sounds confident in\na way Belle & Sebastian has never\nbeen able to manage before, and for\nthis fact they must be congratulated.\nGirls in Peacetime Want to Dance is well\nworth a listen and an outstanding\nachievement for the band. If you have\ntried Belle and Sebastian before and\nhave found them a bit too \u201ctwee\u201d or\ninsular for your liking, try again; you\nmay just like their newly found voice.\nGirls in Peacetime Want to Dance is\nout now on Matador records.\n\n"

The\ncapital of Belgium is known to be\nsmall, but the three days I spent there\nwasn\u2019t enough to visit everywhere I\nwanted to (though if you go all out\non the transport, you might be more\nfortunate than me!). Here are my top\nfive favourite places (though they\nare more like a concentrated area of\nsights) in the historical city:\nGrand Place\nThe most famous square in Belgium,\nthe rectangular shaped Grand Place is\ndeclared a UNESCO World Heritage\nSite. It is unique in the fact that the\nsquare is surrounded by historical\nbuildings starkly different from each\nother: most notable of them all is\nthe Flemish Gothic City Hall taking\nup the South West side, with a 99\nm tall tower topped by the statue of\nArchangel Michael. Opposite it is the\nHouse of the King, noted by its dark\ngrey colour, it was the administrative\nbuilding of governors but now a\nsmall museum telling the history\nof Brussels, especially that of the\nGrand Place and house a gorgeous\ncollection of costume for the famous\nManneqen Pis statue. Next To the SE\nis the House of the Dukes of Brabant,\na row of six buildings with a uniform\nfa\u00e7ade of golden gilded marble arches.\nThe rest of the square are made up of\nunique gild houses, each different to\nthe other.\nHills of Arts\nVirtually next to the Brussels Central\nTrain station is Hills of Art, a small\nurban park that leads up to the Royal\nPalace and overlook the lower town.\nThe first things you will see are the\nequestrian statue of Albert I facing\nhis queen, Elizabeth of Bavaria across\nthe road. Behind Albert I are a neatly\ntrimmed geometric grass patch lined\nwith hedges and trees either side,\nleading up to a large fountain and\nstaircase reaching up to the museum\ndistrict with the Royal Palace visible\nfrom afar.\nBefore you head up to admire the\nspectacular view of the Lower town,\nyou should head to the NE corner of\nthe park and visit the Carillon. This\nsun-shaped Art Deco clock mounted\non the limestone building house\nmany small figures representing\nBelgian national hero and chimes\nhourly.\nPetit Sablon Square\nA tiny green space nestled next to\nthe busy main street leading towards\nJustice Palace, the Petit Sablon Square\nstands out immediately with its\ncolumned fence and statues. The 48\nNeo-Gothic columns surrounding\nthe park are each topped by a statue\nholding a symbol representing\na guild; you can easily entertain\nyourself by walking around and\nguessing which one represent what.\nAt the high point of the park are the\nstatues of Count Horn and Egmont,\ncommemorating their execution in\nthe Grand Square in 1568. With a\nsmall fountain, geometric grass patch,\nthe square makes a nice rest stop\nbetween sights.\nCinquantenair Park\nBordering the east side of the EU\ndistrict, a fair distance away from the\ntown center, the park was built for the\n50th\nanniversary of the independence\nof Belgium by Leopold II. Rectangular\nshaped and symmetrically laid out,\nthis urban oasis is set atop the 2km\nlong Belliard Tunnel connection\nEtterbeek district to downtown. The\nwestern end is home to several Congo\nmonuments, with the east dominated\nby the Military Museum of Belgium\nand Cinquantenaire museum set\neither side of the Triumphal Arch of\nTervuren. If anyone is a car lover, the\nAutoworld behind Cinquantenaire\nmuseum is not to be missed.\nGarleries Saint-Hubert and\nStatue of Charles Buls\nThe Galeries Saint-Hubert is the first\ncovered shopping mall in Europe\nFrom left to right: The Grand Place at night, glowing under the yellow spot lights; Statue of Charles Buls, accompany by his dog Photo: Yung Wing Cheah\nFrom left to right: The Hills of Art overlooking the Lower town; Petit Sablon Square with its neatly trimmed hedges; Triumphal Arch of Tervuren at the end of Cinquantenaire Park Photo:\nYung Wing Cheah\nbuilt in 1847. The glass high ceilings,\ntwo-tiered pastel beige neo-classical\ncorridors are enhanced by the red\nstoned columns and grey tiled floors.\nIt now hosts many restaurants,\nchocolate shops as well as a bookstore\nand theater. Its main corridor is\n200m long and connects to three\nsmaller ones. Walking inside feels\nlike you were back in the 19th\ncentury\nand the air oozes a sophisticated\natmosphere lacking in modern day\nmalls. Situated on a small square on\nthe southern exit is a statue of Charles\nBuls accompany by his dog sat on a\nbench in front of a fountain. Charles\nBuls was the mayor of Brussels during\nthe reign of King Leopold II in the\nlate 19th\ncentury. The statue was\ncreated in 1999 by Henri Lenaerts,\nto commemorate the much loved\nmayor.\n\n"

Only 3% of students\nare able to cover all their outgoings\nwith the financial aid available, with\nthose surveyed facing an average\ndeficit of \u00a3141 a week that is covered\nby parental support or part time jobs.\nStudents in their clinical years (the\nfinal two years of their degree) see\ntheir maintenance loan from Student\nFinance slashed, and, despite being\neligible for a NHS bursary, students\nare still struggling to make ends meet.\nFrom the students surveyed,\nstudents are receiving on average\naround \u00a32,000 from the NHS Bursary\nand another \u00a32,000 from Student\nFinance each year, amounting\nto roughly \u00a398 a week. However\nstudents are also seeing annual\noutgoings amounting to roughly\n\u00a312,000 \u2013 putting many students\nseriously in the red.\nThe survey, run by Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine Student Union\n(ICSMSU), asked current students\nabout their incomes and outgoings,\nand how they were coping with their\nfinances. Over 100 students from\nthe current fifth and sixth year of\nmedicine responded. The survey was\npromoted in all-student emails, on\nvarious ICSMSU Facebook pages and\non twitter.\nUsing the data from those who\nresponded, students in these years\nare paying on average \u00a3141 a week\non rent, \u00a325 on travel, \u00a340 on food\nand are spending around \u00a333 on\neverything else.\nHowever, fifth and sixth year\nstudents do not get as much financial\naid as the lower years, leading to a\ngreater deficit and more stress as a\nresult. Matched with the academic\ndemand of these clinical years, the\nlack of summer holiday available to\nwork full time to save money, and the\nintense timetable that leaves little\nroom for part time work, students are\nstruggling more than ever.\nFinal years also have to arrange and\nundertake an Elective: a compulsory\nelement of their degree, which often\nrequires travelling abroad.\nOne respondent said: \u201cWorking\nat two part time jobs leaves me with\nlittle time to study. I manage to pass\nmy exams each year but I don\u2019t have\nthe opportunity to put enough time\ninto my studies to do any better.\n\u201cTwo years ago I was diagnosed with\ndepression and I believe a lot of it was\nto do with financial difficulties.\u201d\nAnother said: \u201cConstantly being\nworried about making ends meet\nis exhausting: I\u2019m sick and tired of\nalways thinking about it. Currently I\ntutor six times a week, but as a fifth\nyear this is unacceptable and leaves\nme with little or no time to study\nmyself... Even despite this, I am still\nconstantly in the red.\u201d\n47% of students who responded to\nthe survey have a part time job, work\nroughly nine hours a week and earn\non average \u00a312 an hour. However\nonly 18% of students manage to\nremain in the black when balancing\nincome, including bursaries, loans\nand wages and outgoings.\nSaid another respondent: \u201cI am\ncurrently only able to continue\nwith my studies thanks to savings I\naccrued from previous employment\nbefore and during the earlier years of\nmedical school.\n\u201cContinuing with fifth year was\nonly possible financially in thanks to\na large extension of my overdraft, to\naround \u00a32,000.\u201d\nStudents currently in their clinical\nyears, which are the final two years of\nmedicine for Imperial students, aren\u2019t\neligible for a maintenance grant\nfrom Student Finance, and their\nmaintenance loan is also significantly\nreduced too. Instead, they receive an\nNHS means tested bursary, which\nthey do not have to pay back.\nThe maximum students can\ntherefore claim in loans and bursary\nfunding is \u00a39,131 for those in fifth\nyear, and \u00a38,366 for sixth year\nstudents.\nThe NHS also pays their tuition fees\nfor these final two years.\nHowever, when comparing the\nsurvey results to Imperial\u2019s own\nestimations for the cost of living,\n92% of these medical students do\nnot receive enough money through\nfinancial aid and part time work to\ncover Imperial\u2019s predicted living cost.\nImperial estimates that students\nshould expect to pay around \u00a3291\na week to cover rent, travel, leisure,\nacademic-related and food costs.\nThe weekly outgoing of the students\nsurveyed was significantly lower than\nthis: students are managing to live on\nan average of \u00a3237 a week (including\nrent), with many struggling to stay\nafloat.\nAn overview of the NHS bursary\nprovision took place in 2012 when\nthe tuition fees increased, although\ncurrent fifth and sixth year students\nare still subject to the terms and\nconditions of the previous 2007\nScheme.\nThose that started in 2012 or later\nmay fare considerably better due to\nthe introduction of a \u00a31,000 grant\nthat for which everyone, regardless\nof household income, is eligible.\nHowever, the maximum bursary\nstudents can receive will reduce by\nabout \u00a3300.\nThe government loan also decreases\nfurther between the fifth and sixth\nyear; current fifth year students will\nsee the maximum loan available\ndecrease by approximately \u00a3250\nwhen they move into their final year\nthis summer.\nMost students have to turn to\ntheir parents for financial support\nto make up their financial shortfall.\nHowever, many students who replied\nto the survey also said they were\nuncomfortable doing this, or their\nparents were struggling to make ends\nmeet too. Around 1 in 3 of those who\nresponded said their parents were\nunwilling or unable to offer any sort\nof financial support.\nSaid one respondent: \u201cI am\ncompletely reliable on my parents,\nwho have other children to pay for\nand other expenses to worry about.\nI feel guilty about the increasing\namount they need to provide for me.\n\u201cThe loans available are incredibly\nlow in a time where we pay for\naccommodation throughout the year,\ntravel more/further and have an\nelective to organise.\u201d\nSaid another: \u201cMy finances are a\nconstant worry, to the extent that\nI very nearly took steps to take\nsabbatical years to save money by\nworking full time on two occasions.\nI resent that I have become more of\na burden on my parents as I have got\nolder.\u201d\nIt is not just the parents of medical\nstudents too who are struggling to\ncover the cost of their children\u2019s\neducation; a recent national survey\nran by Experian, a global service\ninformation group, found that 1 in\n10 students\u2019 parents are borrowing\nor using credit cards to cover their\nchildren\u2019s living expenses.\n9% of the students who responded\nhave already applied to the Faculty\nof Medicine\u2019s own hardship fund for\nthis academic year. Medical students\ncan also apply to the College\u2019s central\nstudent support fund too if needed.\nFelix spoke to Dr Michael\nSchachter, a senior lecturer in the\nFaculty of Medicine, who also deals\nwith students who are facing a\nfinancial struggle. Schachter told\nFelix how the Faculty of Medicine\n\u00a36,000|\nHow the maximum funding available to students changes over the years, and also under the different funding\nschemes Graph: Philippa Skett\n\n"

Is this some kind of trap? Is it worth the hassle? This are just some of\nthe questions we ask ourselves looking at groupon deals Photo: Flickr/ Aikawa Ke\nYung Nam Cheah break down the process of booking so you know what to expect\nWrite for Travel Felix!\nGreetings travellers!\nNow that January is almost over,hopefully the blueness\nthat came with the start of term would pass over a little\nas well! However we are still two months away from\nEaster,meaning we still got a while to go.\nSometimes you ind yourself sitting there,reminiscing\nthe good times you had during your break...Why not\nturn those into writings and share you experience with\neveryone else?\nTravel writing is one of the most enjoyable thing you\nwill ever do.You get to put your feelings and adventures\ninto words that will induce wanderlust in other people,\ngiving them tips that you wish you had and inducing\nenvy with your oh-so-gorgeous photos.\nIt is also a less gloating way of rubbing your holiday in\nyour friends and family's face.\nTo get your started,here are a few pointers on how to be\na good travel writer:\n1) Be factual.You will be surprise at how many people\nget their facts wrong and run around misleading\neveryone.Wikipedia and Google is just a click away,go\nind out if that building is Baroque or Romanesque.\n2) Give information.Just saying a museum is wonderful\nand runs an exhibit on ancient Egypt is not enough.Put\nthe opening times,admission fees and website link on.\n3) Keep it short and sweet.Don't get carried away and\nwrite a 1000 words essay on Belgium Fries (though I wish\nI could)!\nYUNG NAM CHEAH\n\"Be\nprepared\nto pay\nextra for\nflights... to\nmake the\nmost of\nyour trip.\"\n\"With\nthe right\nexpectations,\nthis will\nbcome the\nnew way\nto travel.\nin comfort\nWith groupons becoming\nmore and more universal,\none can virtually buy\nanything from clothes to household\nappliance to restaurant deals at a\ndiscounted price. However, a lot of\npeople hesitate in the face of travel\ndeals.\nFor those of you less familiar with\nthe concept, groupon is a platform\nfor merchants to offer deals to\nconsumers at a lower than normal\nprice. A few of the more well-known\nbrands are Wowcher, Amazonlocal,\nLiving social and of course, Groupon.\nMost of the travel offers massively\ndiscounted flights, as well as\naccommodation and breakfast at a\nhotel (say goodbye to dodgy hostel\nand communal showers!) to a popular\ndestination such as Berlin and\nBudapest.\nSome even throw in tours for an\nextra ten to twenty quid such as river\ncruise, horse riding and even all\ninclusive deals.\nThe price usually hover around\n100 to 200 for Europe destinations\ndepending on the length of stay,\nnormally from 2 to 5 nights. Deals to\nAmerica, South East Asia and other\nexotic places are sometimes available\ntoo, starting around 500.\nDespite the obvious draw, some\npeople are afraid of fine print and\nhidden charges; and that\u2019s reasonable.\nI had many reservations when I first\nsaw them, and it wasn\u2019t until a friend\ntaking the plunge that I realized\nwith the right expectation, this really\nwill become the new way to travel in\ncomfort affordably:\n1) Read the fine print\nThis might sound obvious, but\nsometimes people get too excited by\nthe prospect of it and forgot to check.\nIt should state the period available to\nredeem the voucher as well as what\nis included and what isn\u2019t. Make sure\nyou know the refund/ cancelation\npolicy so you can get your money\nback if things go south.\n2) Call ahead\nCall to inquire the availability or\nmake sure you are relatively free\nduring the stated time period.\nSometimes the date you want might\nnot be available \u2013 especially if it\u2019s a\nholiday period.\n3) Make time for the call\nThese tour operators often have a\ndozen calls coming in at one time.\nYou need to expect them to take a\nwhile to answer you, as well as having\nto call you back to confirm certain\ndetails.\n4) Be prepared to pay extra\nMost of the time the flights included\nin original price is at an ungodly\nhour in the morning or late at night\nat Luton. So if you want to make the\nmost of your trip and the groupon,\nbe prepared to pay around 40 pounds\nper person to upgrade to Ryan air or\nEasyjet at Gatwick or Standsted. Trust\nme, you will save half, if not all of the\nmoney from not having to taxi to the\nairport.\n5) Check hotel locations\nThis is especially important for\nwith multiply hotel offers. Usually\nthe hotel will be centrally located,\nand it might be worthwhile to visit\nits website and check its rating on\nTripadvisor. Some deal will offer\na choice of hotel, if you have your\nheart set on one of the hotels calling\nthe travel agent ahead to check its\navailability to avoid disappointment.\nBeware that some travel agency will\ntry to give you another hotel - do not\ngive out your groupon code until you\nhave the dates and hotel you desire.\n6) Hand luggage only\nThough this one might be obvious,\nbut unless you throw in another\nextra 30, you will have to adhere to\nthe hand luggage restriction of the\nairline. However don\u2019t worry; most\npeople are on the same boat\nAfter that, it\u2019s really just printing\nout the hotel voucher and checking\nin online at the right time. Although\nmy friend and I experienced a slight\nhiccup with check in because the\ntravel agency booked for us, although\nfixing it was as easy as calling them\nand they checked in for us and\nemailed us the document.\nIf you don\u2019t like the hassle of calling\nthe travel agent, and believe me, I\nhate calling people at a restricted time\nperiod too, then you should check\nout Voyageprive. It\u2019s a luxury travel\nwebsite offering 4 to 5 star hotels\nand you can forgo the whole calling\nprocess by simply choosing options\nonline.\nBe it your favourite hang out or travel adventures, we want to hear\nit!

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\nFELIX 30.01.2015\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk Tech Editors Jamie Dutton & Osama Awara\nOsama Awara discusses the challenges behind the high speed transport system\nEngineering the Hyperloop prototype\nIt was in 2012 that the restless\nentrepreneur Elon Musk first\nannounced his idea for a high\nspeed transport system \u2013 the\nHyperloop. Described by the magnate\nas \u2018a cross between a Concorde, a\nrailgun and an air hockey-table,\u2019 this\nnext-generation train system aims\nto transport people at speeds of over\n700 mph. This would mean a journey\nfrom London to Edinburgh would\ntake half an hour, faster than a jumbo\njet while at the same time avoiding all\nthose airport waiting times.\nInitially, Musk released his ideas\nand plans of the Hyperloop for\nother entrepreneurs and engineers\nto take up the task of designing and\nbuilding this feat. Eighteen months\nhave passed, and now Musk has\nannounced on Twitter that he will\nbuild a Hyperloop prototype in Texas.\nClearly he has grown impatient,\nwhich begs the question: how exactly\nwill this prototype be made?\nThe Hyperloop being built is for\ntest purposes only and not an actual\nuseable transport system. It is to\nencourage other companies and\nstudents to come up with the pod\ndesigns themselves. For a second\ntime, Musk is trying to give people a\npiece of the pie.\nOne of the greatest challenges is\ndesigning the Hyperloop so that it can\nreach such high speeds. This means\nthat the biggest threat to the speed of\nany mobile pod or carriage is friction.\nClassical train systems experience\nhigh levels of resistance due to the\ncontact of the train wheels with rail\ntracks.\nThe Hyperloop aims to avoid this\nby having the pods floating in the\nair by magnetic levitation, similar to\nthe Shanghai maglev trains in China.\nPart of engineering is observing; if\nan engineer can create something\nnew out of existing creations, then\nhe is a good observer. However,\nthe difference comes with the\nintroduction of air bearings.\nThe air bearings allow the pod to\nlevitate while at the same time the\npod will force air from the front of\nthe pod to the rear through holes,\nusing similar techniques to the well-known air-hockey game \u2013 an existing\ncreation.\nOne issue that arises is that when\nthe capsule is travelling at high\nspeeds, if its cross-section fills too\nmuch of the tube, the air won\u2019t have\nthe time or space to travel around the\ncapsule. This would lead to a build-up\nof air at the front of the capsule \u2013 an\nundesired effect called choked flow.\nChoked flow leads to huge amounts\nof friction that would prevent the\ncapsules reaching such high speeds.\nA proposed solution to this is to use\nan air compressor, which will pump\nair from the front through a nozzle\nto the rear. This essentially creates\na vacuum space at the front of the\ncapsule, reducing the pressure in the\ntube and hence the resistance.\nWhen objects travel at high speeds,\nit is necessary to avoid bends and\ninclines in order to ensure that there\nare minimal excessive G-forces acting\non the passengers.\nExperiencing an excessive G-force\ncould make the journey a danger to\nhealth, let alone a very uncomfortable\nride. With this, the Hyperloop tube\nthat connects one city to another\nmust be kept straight, which for\nobvious geographical reasons would\nbe difficult to achieve. Texas was\nchosen to locate the test track for this\nreason, as the amount of free space\nthere is more than anyone can ask for\na Hyperloop test playground.\nCareful urban planning would\nbe required to practically build a\nHyperloop tube linking one city to\nanother, which may potentially pose\nthe biggest challenge to a successful\ninfrastructure.\nThe test track is certainly one big\nstep forward to the development\nof the Hyperloop. It is up to big\ncompanies, researchers and even\nstudents to bring forward ideas and\nbuild designs of pods to be used in the\nrail system of this grand design.\nIt would be very interesting to see\nwhat proposals are brought forward\nand how they would fare against one\nanother, it is usually the simplest of\ndesigns that fare the best.\nA Hyperloop concept for a pod, featuring plenty of room and leg space inclination.

    "content": "16 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n30.01.2015\nTelevision Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\nTelevision\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJoshua Renken gives a spoiler-free overview of the U.S. Netlix\nhit show, House of Cards\nThe Best Show Not\nOn Television\nBased on the novels by Michael\nDobbs and the British political\ndrama by Andrew Davies,\nHouse of Cards is a Netflix original\nseries that follows U.S. Congressman\nand Majority Whip Francis\nUnderwood, played by Kevin Spacey,\nwho after being denied the position\nhe was promised of Foreign Secretary\nin a new democratic cabinet sets out\nto take revenge on the administration\nhe helped to elect and take the\nPresidency for himself. The series\nalso stars Robin Wright as Frank\u2019s\nchilling wife Claire, and Kate Mara\nas the young journalist Zoe Barnes,\nwho forges a secret relationship with\nFrank in a desperate attempt to get\nher professional break.\nHouse of Cards is an American\nremake of the four-part 1990\nminiseries of the same name and\nsignifies a real landmark in the\ncontinuing evolution of television\nproduction and consumption. Netflix\nchose to upload each of 13-episode\nweb television series all in one\ngo, dispensing with the television\nconvention of releasing an episode\nevery week. The first two seasons of\nHouse of Cards have been released on\nthe February of each year beginning\nin 2013 and the third series will be\nput up on the site on Feb 27th.\nAt the centre of this show lies the\nenigmatic relationship between Frank\nand Claire Underwood. This pair of\ntwo-faced, power crazed sociopaths\nhave created a successful partnership\nbuilt on a fierce mutual respect and\ncandid communication that allows\nthem to overcome the conflicts that\nemerge as they rise up the political\nfood chain. Constantly scheming\nabout future events, Frank and Claire\noften share a single cigarette late at\nnight to discuss their strategies for\nthe next day. Their marriage is filled\nwith sexual promiscuity and secrets\non both sides, but somehow their\nreciprocal admiration and shared\nsense of ambition overrides these\nproblems to create a sleek and highly\nutilitarian relationship that works for\nboth of them.\nA self-made man with a thick\nsouthern drawl, Frank shows\nlittle personal regard for political\nideology, instead favouring \u201cruthless\npragmatism\u201d. He is a master of\npersuasion and political manoeuvring\nwho is remorseless in his acquisition\nof power for power\u2019s sake. As Claire\nsays: \u201cHe\u2019s a man who knows how\nto take what he wants\u201d. Frank has\nsexual liaisons with both men and\nwomen during the series, but he is\nnever explicitly identified as gay\nor bisexual. At one point after a\nconversation with his wife, Frank\ndeclares: \u201cI love that woman. I love\nher more than sharks love blood.\u201d\nThis comparison suggests a kind of\nanimalistic passion but could just\nhave been included by the writers\nto draw attention to the Frank\u2019s\nbloodthirsty and visceral obsession\nwith power that Claire encourages\nand facilitates. She is a constant\nsource of empowerment for him. \u201cMy\nhusband doesn\u2019t apologize,\u201d she tells\nhim after a setback. \u201cEven to me.\u201d\nSome have suggested that Frank is\nsecretly gay, but becomes attracted to\nwomen due to the sense of dominance\nthat it gives him. \u201cA great man once\nsaid, everything is about sex. Except\nsex. Sex is about power.\u201d This famous\nOscar Wilde quote seems especially\npertinent when it comes to Frank\u2019s\nsexuality.\nFrank Underwood first attended\nmilitary academy before going onto\nHarvard Law, where he met Claire.\nIt was her parents that bankrolled\nFrank\u2019s political campaigns early\non. His political success stems from\nhis ability to subtly sway people\nto act in the way that best suits his\ninterests. This is easier to do in some\nthat others, but Frank always finds a\nway to beat his opponents. In House\nof Cards you are led to believe that\nFrank and Claire are both ready to\ndo anything that is required, that\nthere is no end to the depths of their\ndepravity.\nOne of the most refreshing aspects\nof this series is the regularity with\nwhich Frank Underwood \u2018breaks\nthe fourth wall\u2019 and talks directly to\nthe viewer. There are many critical\nmoments in conversations when\nUnderwood will lean in and face the\ncamera, giving a pithy explanation\nto help elucidate the gravity of the\nsituation. Frank also likes to reflect\non other character\u2019s misgivings\nand weaknesses. After one heated\nexchange between himself and a\nformer staffer, Frank professes his\nstrong preference for power over\nmoney. \u201cMoney is the McMansion\nin Sarasota that starts falling apart\nafter 10 years. Power is the old stone\nbuilding that stands for centuries. I\ncannot respect someone who doesn\u2019t\nsee the difference.\u201d\nFrank\u2019s straight-to-camera\nmonologues make the experience\nof watching House of Cards feel that\nmuch more personal and indulgent\nto watch than other series. And this\ncomponent works especially well\nwhen you consider the way many\npeople are watching it \u2013 individually\non their laptops. Frank\u2019s intimate\ndisclosures help the audience to see\nthings from his perspective; where\nother characters are regarded as\nlittle more than pawns that he can\nmanipulate. This show is awash\nwith great lines from Frank and his\nsoliloquies work very well to add\nsome nuance to the series.\nFrank is one of that strange\nbreed of characters; a likeable\nvillain. One other likeable villain\nis Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III, who is\ncoincidentally the last character that\nKevin Spacey played before stepping\ninto Underwood\u2019s shoes. Richard III\nbreaks the fourth wall in the original\nplay and there are actually a great\nmany parallels that can be drawn\nbetween House of Cards and two of\nShakespeare\u2019s greatest plays: Richard\nIII and Macbeth.\nBeau Willimon writes Underwood\u2019s\nmonologues exceedingly well. For\nexample in a scene where he is\nalone in a church after a significant\nservice, he speaks the lines: \u201cThere\nis no solace above or below, only us,\nsmall, solitary, striving, battling one\nanother, I pray to myself for myself\u201d.\nAlmost every line is quotable.\nBorderline poetry.\nThe very first words that Frank\nutters in the first episode are: \u201cThere\nare two kinds of pain. The sort of\npain that makes you strong, or useless\npain. The sort of pain that\u2019s only\nsuffering. I have no patience for\nuseless things.\u201d (He strangles a dog to\nend it\u2019s suffering after a car collision)\n\u201cThere. No more pain.\u201d\nRobin Wright gives a career topping\nperformance as Claire Underwood,\nthe Lady Macbeth of modern day\nWashington. Claire is a lobbyist and\nruns an environmental nonprofit\norganization, while acting as Frank\u2019s\nprimary accomplice. She is every bit\nas hungry for power as her husband\nand in many ways, comes across as\neven more insidious than Frank.\nClaire is clinical and considered in\nher actions, with a cold exterior and\nthe capacity for barbaric threats if the\nmoment demands. \u201cI am willing to let\nyour child wither and die inside you,\nif that\u2019s what\u2019s required\u201d stands out as\na particularly memorable instance of\nhostility towards a former employee.\nClaire is very much the ice-queen of\nAmerican politics.\nHouse of Cards does a great job at\nshowing the wheels of democracy\nin action and shines a light, albeit\na dim one, at the ugly culture of\nprivate scheming and negotiation\nthat goes on in Washington behind\nclosed doors. It\u2019s not pretty, but it\u2019s\ncertainly exhilarating and you cannot\nhelp but be stimulated by the candid\nconversation. Favours are constantly\nbeing exchanged that range from\nmoney, information and public\nbacking to sex or getting people\u2019s kids\ninto the right Colleges. Washington is\nportrayed as a relentless dog-eat-dog\narena full of secrets, where people\nblur the boundaries between private\nand public incentives to get ahead. In\nHouse of Cards we see that politics is a\ndirty game played by smart people. If\nthe idealism and romanticism of The\nWest Wing gave you faith in politics,\n\"I love that\nwoman I\nlove her\nmore than\nsharks love\nblood.\"\n\u201cPower\nis the\nold stone\nbuilding\nthat\nstands for\ncenturies.\u201d\nPhoto: Beau Willimon, Netflix\n\n"

Unfortunately, this also applies\nto couples, out of necessity or to chase\nafter an opportunity elsewhere. Both\nsides mean well and they each want\nthe best for each other, but it\u2019s painful\nfor a relationship to be reduced to a\nwindow on Skype or a voice over the\nphone.\nSometimes, the distance is two\nhours away in another town.\nSometimes, it\u2019s on the other side\nof the world with a different time\nzone. Sometimes it\u2019s temporary, only\nas long as a university degree and\nyou\u2019ll see them every holiday. But\nsometimes the end is so far in the\nfuture that you have to accept that\nthis is the way the relationship is\ngoing to be.\nAll forms of long distance\nrelationship (or LDR) are difficult.\nBut with the connected world of\nthe internet, distance between two\npeople will seem closer, evolving into\nanother kind of relationship that\ndoesn\u2019t appear as far as before.\nI would know. Ever since we\u2019ve\nstarted going out a year and a half\nago, my girlfriend and I have mostly\nspent our relationship separated by\na six (sometimes seven) hours time\ndifference. She\u2019ll either be in England\nwhile I\u2019m in Thailand or vice versa.\nThe longest we\u2019ve been physically\ntogether was three months, and it\nwas those moments that made it\ndefinitely worth the wait.\nI\u2019m not going to lie; there were a\nlot of things we had to adjust to cope\nwith the separation. So, at the risk of\nseeming like an Agony Uncle, here\nare some tips that would help you\nmaintain a healthy long distance\nrelationship.\nTell each other how you cope\nI avoided saying \u2018communication\u2019\nsince this broad term has been used to\ndeath in all relationship advice posts.\nWhat I mean is just talking about\nwhat you prefer or are comfortable\nwith. You\u2019d be surprised with what\nfeels \u2018natural\u2019 to each person in a long\ndistance relationship.\nDo you like to leave Skype on\nwhenever you get home so you feel\nthat you\u2019re always together? Or do\nyou sometimes try to avoid Skype-ing\nbecause it emphasises how far away\nyou are from each other, especially\nwhen it\u2019s daytime in one screen and\nnight in another?\nYou might think that this\nwould bring on some awkward\nconversations but I feel that\nthis is valuable in avoiding\nmisunderstanding or wrong\nassumptions. You don\u2019t want to\nlabel each other with something that\nthey\u2019re not. Skype-ing or texting daily\nto keep the warmth alive is not clingy.\nAt the same time, Skype-ing only\nonce in a while with the intention of\nmaking every Skype session valuable\ndoes not mean they\u2019re becoming cold.\nPeople have different ways to adjust\nto the new situation and it never\nhurts to make that clear.\nUpdate each other\nThe scariest thing about long distance\nrelationships is how easy it is to drift\napart without even realising it. You\nmay forget to talk about what you\u2019ve\nbeen up to for days, then weeks, and\nbefore you know it, you have no\nidea what you\u2019re each up to. Then\nyou begin to lose out of each other\u2019s\nreferences and jokes. Suddenly you\nnotice that someone else began to\nunderstand them better than you.\nThat\u2019s our secret fear. However,\nfrequent updates on something so\nsimple as one another\u2019s days can do\nwonders to keep you connected. It\nmakes the distance seem smaller, as\nyou\u2019ll be able to relate to what he or\nshe is doing and vice versa. Next time\nyou talk will also be much easier since\nthere\u2019ll always be things to pick up on\nother than how much you miss each\nother.\nAccommodate each other\nThe two of you will likely have\ndifferent lives, meeting new people\nin different settings. You\u2019ll be with\ndifferent groups of friends doing lots\nof stuff at different times. And that\u2019s\nnot to factor in time difference in\nLong distance relationship is a challenge, sure, but you can still go to bed smiling with the phone in your hand.\nPhoto: tabby-like-a-cat\nChanon Wongsatayanont talks about coping with LDR If you are concerned about your\nown mental health,or that of a\nloved one,there are people out\nthere you can talk to who can\ngive you advice,or will be there\nto listen.\nHelplines\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr helpline):\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.samaritans.org.\nuk\nAnxiety Help :\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite: www.nopanic.org.uk\nEating Disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAddiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite: www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health Centre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nsome cases. It will be much harder to\norganize a time to meet since you\u2019ll\nboth have to be at home in front of a\ncomputer.\nBut compromises must be made\non both sides to make time for each\nother for the reasons in the previous\npoint.\nShare new experiences\nNo doubt you\u2019ve had lots of amazing\nexperience with your significant\nother while you were together but\nyou can start new experiences by\nbeginning a TV series, book, hobby or\neven start a new class together.\nYou will most likely already share\na lot of that already, but when\nyou\u2019re apart it\u2019s easy to feel like you\ncan never hang out the same way\nanymore. True, you can\u2019t be there\nphysically, but you can still do things\nyou\u2019d normally do together, just in\ndifferent locations. The best thing?\nIt would bring back old times and get\nyou talking the way you would if you\nwere together.\nAnd this doesn\u2019t all have to be\nindoors stuff. What my girlfriend\nand I always do when we travel\nsomewhere new is to create a photo\ndiary and send it to each other. That\nway, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re seeing\nthose new things together.\nGestures\nNow what these gestures mean\ncompletely on you. Are you the sweet,\ndependable or fun type of couple? Do\nyou prefer old-fashioned letters and\nparcels, mysterious flower deliveries\nor surprise snapchats? These are\nhelpful as reminders of those times\nyou were together.\nLooking for ideas? It\u2019s the easiest\nthing in the world. I just searched\n\u201clong distance relationship\u201d in\nGoogle and almost everything is\nrelevant. I mean, the first link is a list\nof 100 activities couples can do while\napart. There\u2019s even a whole subreddit\nwhere redditors in long distance\nrelationships share their stories or\ngive each other advice.\nI can\u2019t lie, I know how difficult long\ndistance relationship is. It\u2019s horrible\nto have someone you love confined\nto Skype, the screen just within reach\nbut physically so far away.\nBut trust me, there are upsides to\nit. You will appreciate each other so\nmuch more, as each moment you\nspend together becomes so precious\nyou won\u2019t take it for granted. When\nyou\u2019ve come to the light at the end\nof the tunnel, you\u2019ll both be much\nstronger for it and you\u2019ll be glad\nyou\u2019ve made the trip.\n\n"

She\nhas struggled since then, and was\ndiagnosed with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome,\nan auto-immune disease, during the\nUS Open of 2011.\nNick Kyrgios does it again\nThe Australian boy wonder, who is\nonly 19, wowed the home crowd with\nhis progress at the Australian Open\nthis year. Kyrgios completed a truly\nstunning comeback against Andreas\nSeppi to win having been two sets\ndown in the fourth round. His run\nwas ended in the Quarter-Finals by\nAndy Murray in straight sets, much\nto the dismay of the crowd in the Rod\nLaver Arena.\nRafael Nadal\u2019s form\nIt\u2019s been a mixed Australian Open\nfor Rafael Nadal. He looked very\nconvincing in his first match against\nMikhail Youzhny, only to need five\nsets to get past qualifier Tim Smyczek\nin the second round. He seemed to\nhave got rid of the cobwebs from that\nwith a couple of emphatic victories,\nonly to be dumped in equally\nemphatic fashion against Tomas\nBerdych in the Quarter-Finals. His\nAustralian Open tally remains at one.\nUpsets galore\nIf there\u2019s anything this edition of the\nAustralian Open will be remembered\nby, it\u2019s the number of upsets that\nhave occurred. Four of the top eight\nseeds in the Women\u2019s Singles failed\nto reach the Quarter-Finals, while\nonly seven of the top 16 reached the\nFourth Round. There were fewer\nshocks in the Men\u2019s tournament,\nbut the most notable one was Roger\nFederer. The legend lost in the third\nround against Andreas Seppi in four\nsets.\nBouchard misses out in a big\nmatch\u2026 again\nEugenie Bouchard is fast gaining a\nreputation for missing out in the\nbig games. The young Canadian star\nreached the Quarter-Finals before\nbeing comprehensively beaten in\nstraight sets by Maria Sharapova. In\ngrand slams, Bouchard has only ever\nbeaten Angelique Kerber out of the\ntop ten, and has not come close in\nother matches against them. She may\nhave two semi-finals and a final to\nher name, but it could be argued that\nshe has had fairly open routes to the\nlatter stages.\nMurray back to his best?\nAndy Murray has looked very good\nat this year\u2019s Australian Open. He\nwas dominant in his first three\nrounds, before dropping a set against\nGrigor Dimitrov in the fourth\nround. Followers of Murray (and\nthose who have nothing better to\ndo than turn British Eurosport\non) will have noticed that his first\nOn Wednesday 21st\nJanuary,17\ndetermined runners from Imperial\nCollege's very own cross country\nand athletics club braved the cold\nand travelled to Alexandra Palace\nfor the irst London College League\nrace of the term.They were greeted\nwith ankle deep mud.Before the\nrace even began,Anna Lawson\nreturned from her warm up with\nknees and hands already covered in\nmud.Soon the runners reluctantly\ntook off their warm layers and\nmade their way to the start line.The\ngun sounded and the race was on! A\nmass of students from unis around\nLondon charged off onto the\ncourse,with/without losing their\nshoes to the muck.A flat circuit\naround the lower park grounds (as\nflat as you can get in a mud bath)\nwas followed by the hill.The Hill,\nwhich Alexandra Palace is infamous\nfor,will make even your strongest\nrunners weak at the knees.Once\nthis had been conquered,it was a\nfast and perilously steep downhill\nback into the sludge once more.Two\nlaps for the girls,and three laps for\nthe guys.A inal sprint (if you could\nactually move without your feet\nslipping beneath you) and then over\nthe inish line.\nImperial's very own Sarah Johnson\nbrought our women's team home\nand came an outstanding second\nplace in the women's race overall.\nShe was shortly followed by Alex\nMundell (4th),then by Ellie Johnston\n(16th) and the rest of the women's\nteam.The men's race saw Chris\nBannon take a clear win with tactical\nsurge up the inal hill.He was\nfollowed by great runs from Chris\nThomas (16th),Rupert Hepton (38th)\nand the rest of the men's team.IC's\nrunners achieved great results on\na challenging course,even if they\ncouldn't see the colour of their shoes\nanymore.After the postrace cake\nsession descended into a mud ight,\nwith many casualties,the team\ntrooped on to the nearest spoons\n(which wasn't that near) for a well-deserved calorie binge.With a tough\ncondition race like that under their\nbelts,it's safe to say the ICXC are\nwell and truly prepared for BUCS\nXC on the 31st\n.Want to join the fun?\nFind us on facebook or email run@\nimperial.ac.uk\nJESS PRIOR\nIC CROSS COUNTRY\nDo you have what it takes to get down and dirty with Imperial Cross\nCountry?

This has\nbeen attributed to him going back to\na previous style of serve. His coach\nAmelie Mauresmo also seems to be\nflourishing now that she is working as\npart of a significantly smaller team.\nIs Djokovic Unstoppable?\nNovak Djokovic is on a very good\nrun. He hasn\u2019t lost a set throughout\nthe tournament so far (although that\ncould change in the semi-final against\nStanislas Wawrinka), and barring\nan out of character performance on\nFriday will almost certainly be facing\nAndy Murray in the final on Sunday\nmorning.\nMadison Keys: Future Star?\nMadison Keys is another player for\nthe future, and she gave a glimpse of\nwhat we can expect in future years\nat the tournament. Having defeated\nthe 29th\nseed in the second round, the\nunseeded American then dispatched\nPetra Kvitova in the third round,\nas well as Venus Williams in the\nQuarter-Finals.

Students\ncompleted the online coursework\nearlier this month.\nThe coursework for the Business\nEconomics module is worth 30%\nof the overall module mark. The\ncourse is taken as optional, for credit\ncourse, which is run by the Business\nSchool but is taken by undergraduates\nfrom various degree steams. If taken\nfor credit, the module is worth a\nsignificant portion of the year\u2019s\noverall mark.\nAn anonymous source informed\nthe mathematics department that\nstudents had been using a Google\ndocument online to share the\nquestions from the online coursework\non a Facebook group for students\ntaking the course.\nQuestions in the test would appear\nin a random order with randomised\nmultiple choice answers, and people\nposted the questions to the Google\ndocument until a complete set of\nthe questions was available for\nparticipants to view as the session\nprogressed.\nThis prompted Professor\nJonathan Mestel, The Mathematics\nDepartment\u2019s Director of\nUndergraduate Studies, to send\nan email out on Tuesday to maths\nundergraduates in third and fourth\nyear, detailing the alleged plagiarism\nand how \u201cit is likely that this part\nof the assessment will be nullified.\u201d\nThe email also asked for those who\nmay know more about the situation\nto come forward, and that they\nwill be kept informed of any other\ndevelopments.\nProfessor Mestel has also confirmed\nto Felix that although they know\nwhat Facebook group it was, it was\nnot the one used by the mathematics\nundergraduates.\nThe Business School was only made\naware of the allegations of plagiarism\nafter the email was sent by Professor\nMestel, and are still in discussions\nover what to do as a result of these\nallegations.\nWhen Felix contacted Jeremy\nFernando, a senior teaching\nfellow from the Business School\nand the point of contact for these\nundergraduate modules, Fernando\nsaid that: \u201cWe still need to gather\nmore information, as we\u2019ve only\nheard this third hand. The only\ninformation we have is from Mestel.\u201d\nProfessor Mestel said to Felix that\nthey are now waiting on the Business\nSchool, although they take allegations\nof plagiarism very seriously. \u201cWe are\nnow waiting to hear what the business\nschool thinks is appropriate, and it is\nlikely all departments will be taking\nthe same action once something is\ndecided.\u201d\nThis is not the first time this exam\nhas faced complications: the online\ntest was run before Christmas,\nbut was postponed as Blackboard,\nthe College\u2019s Virtual Learning\nEnvironment, crashed. The test\nwas scheduled to start at 18:00, but\nwithin ten minutes students were\ncomplaining of images not loading\nand missing formulae and eventually\nBlackboard went down completely.\nFelix approached the Mathematics\nDepartment Representative, Arjit\nGupta, who told us: \u201cUnfortunately,\nI do not know a lot about this issue\nyet and am currently investigating.\nI am confident that the department\nwill ensure fairness to all students,\nregardless of whether or not they are\ntaking this course.\u201d\nA statement released from the\nBusiness School to Felix said that it is\n\u201cformally investigating an allegation\nof collusion in an open book online\ntest for undergraduate students.\n\u201cThe investigation is still ongoing,\nbut we are aiming to conclude it as\nquickly as possible and any outcomes\nwill be considered together with the\nother relevant academic departments.\n\u201cAll students assigned the test have\nImperial College London\nannounced Sarah Porter\nWaterbury as its very first Vice\nPresident (Advancement) on 27th\nJanuary.

Photo: Ellie Kurttz\nFred Fyles heads to Hindustan for the National Theatre\u2019s new play\nThe first challenge that\npresented itself to writer Tanya\nRonder and director Nadia\nFall, when planning on bringing a\nproduction of Pakistani play Dara to\nthe National Theatre, was how to tell\na story that is a legend in the Indian\nsubcontinent, but largely unknown\nin the UK? Dara, originally written by\nPakistani playwright Shahid Nadeem,\nhad an outing in India a couple of\nyears ago, where most are familiar\nwith the struggle between brothers\nDara Shikoh and Emperor Aurangzeb\nfor the throne of the Mughal Empire.\nWhile some aspects of the play are\ntranslated well, notably the set design\nand performances, on the whole\nmuch of the nuance and drama is lost\non its journey to the South Bank.\nTaking place across the Muslim\nMughal Empire, which stretched\nfrom Agra to Bengal, Gujarat to\nAfghanistan, Dara opens in the\nyear 1659, two years after emperor\nShah Jahan\u2019s illness triggered a\nbattle for supremacy between the\neligible princes, of whom Dara and\nAurangzeb were the major players.\nDefeated by his brother\u2019s army, Dara\nis captured, shackled and paraded\nbefore his beloved people, and tried\nas an apostate of Islam. While that is\nthe basic gist of the story, it belies the\ncomplexity of the script, which zips\nbetween time-zones frequently, and\nexplores the stories of a number of\nother characters.\nWhile this certainly makes for a\ndynamic plot line, the speed with\nwhich things move on means that it\ncan be difficult to follow the plot. We\nare shifted through time and space so\nfast that it feels like we are developing\nmotion sickness; dates and places are\nprojected on the back of the stage with\nsuch high frequency it becomes hard\nto know where we are, who the people\nare meant to be, or why we should\ncare. In one \u2013 admittedly extreme\nexample \u2013 a character you\u2019d think\nwould be pretty central to the plot is\nintroduced in one scene, ends that\nscene by starting to cough, and is dead\nby the next. When the action is this\nrapid, we are afforded no opportunity\nto get to know the characters, much\nless relate to them.\nThat being said, the performances\nfrom the cast in general is very solid,\nin particular those of Aurangzeb,\nplayed by Sargon Yelda, and Itbar,\nthe imperial eunuch slave, played by\nChook Sibtain. Sibtain imbues his\ncharacter with just the right amount\nof sympathy and righteous anger;\nhe is clearly conflicted between a\nfeeling of duty towards his masters,\nand a resentment that bubbles just\nbelow the surface at those who have\nenslaved and mutilated him \u2013 he\nis an injured bird, imprisoned in a\ngilded cage. You would expect Zubin\nVarla, who plays Dara himself, to be\nthe strongest actor in the company,\nand on the whole his performance is\nsolid. There are some moments that\nthreaten to dip over into melodrama,\nespecially when his sonorous voice\nbegins to take on a somewhat hammy\ntone, but he recovers himself in\na blistering court scene, coming\ntowards the end of part 1, which\nmust be at least 45 minutes long.\nVarla, reduced to rags, rages against\nhis captors, furious not because of\nhis debasement, but because of their\nmisunderstanding of his appreciation\nof Sufi Islam.\nUnfortunately, this marks the\npinnacle of the drama, and in\nthe second half things descend\ninto a somewhat chaotic series of\nimages and scenes, which add up\nto an unsatisfying conclusion. The\ncharacter of Dara in particular seems\nto lose the fire that burnt inside\nhim during the first half of the\nproduction; instead of the relatable,\nprincely character we saw during the\ncourtroom scene, we are left with a\nman who no longer responds to any\nkind of stimulus. While I appreciate\nthat this is supposed to be part of his\nZen attitude towards life, it means\nthat the character is laconic to near-brain death; it is indeed difficult to\nsympathise with a character who\nis unable to express any kind of\nemotion.\nAnother factor that interferes\nwith our sympathies towards the\ncharacters is simply how one-dimensional they seem; while I\nappreciate it is difficult to bring\ncharacters who have entered into\nlegend into living, breathing actors,\nDara and Aurangzeb are really\nnot much more than a collection\nof tropes. What should be an\nexploration of different paths of\nIslam ends up simply being a tale of\nradicalism vs. multiculturalism, a\ndebate which has long ceased to be a\nfresh topic for the arts.\nWhile the staging at the National\nTheatre is always of a good quality, I\nfeel that for this production further\ncomment is warranted; the set they\nhave put together for Dara is nothing\nshort of stunning. Comprising\nmainly of white marble, the set has\na classical feel, almost like a Greek\nstage transported to Agra. The ornate\ndetailing found on the screens used\nto divide the stage and the decorative\nmotifs on the balconies is clearly\ninfluenced by the design of the Taj\nMahal, commissioned in memory\nof Dara\u2019s mother and seen by his\nimprisoned father from his cell\nwindow.\nWhat is striking about the set\nis simply how large is makes the\nstage seem, inflating the Lyttelton\nTheatre to what looks like twice its\nnormal size. While the characters\nare indeed dwarfed by their\nsurroundings, the stage never seems\nimposing or stale \u2013 you can really\nimagine people working, living,\nand loving within the walls of the\npalace. Scene changes are \u2018assisted\u2019 by\nperformances and dancers, who seem\nto add little to the overall production;\nthat being said, the decision to\nbring in a trio of musicians, playing\nharmonium, santoor, and percussion,\nis an inspired one, adding another\ndimension to the play, making the\naction seem just that more dramatic.\nOverall, despite the impression I\nmay have given above Dara is a very\ncompetent production; competent,\nbut not excellent. Issues with the\npacing, characterisation, and plot-line\n\u2013 which may be linked to Ronder\u2019s\ndecision to add in a number of key\ncharacters who were not in the\noriginal text \u2013 make it somewhat\nimpenetrable, meaning it is very hard\nto sympathise with the characters,\nmuch less care what they have to say.\nThe stage is excellent, and it is so\nrefreshing to see an all-minority cast\nputting on a production at a major\nLondon venue, Dara does not live up\nto what it promises.\nDara is on at the National Theatre\nuntil 4th\nApril.

It\nis not a new phenomenon that medics\ntake a massive cut in funding after\nfourth year. As far as I can tell, this\nis the first time anyone has tried to\ntackle the monetary troubles faced by\nfifth and final year medics.\nMedics\u2019 final two years are tough\nand vitally important; we start\nmetamorphosing into doctors.\nNot only are we in hospitals pretty\nmuch all day every day, we are also\nexpected to study at any available\nopportunity. There is a huge amount\nto learn and failing to do so could\nlead to much more than poor grades,\nbut has potential to impact on our\ncompetency after we qualify.\nA significant number of us are\nstruggling financially to a point\nwhere we have no option but to\nwork several evenings a week.\nSome students expressed guilt over\nsometimes leaving hospitals early to\nget to work on time, others angst over\nthe lack of time they have to study\nas a result of work commitments.\nAlthough some doctors are\nsympathetic to this, there are plenty\nof consultants and registrars who are\nless understanding. The college is also\ndeeply unsupportive.\nI ran into difficulties during\npaediatrics when applying for\nresidency placements (catapulted to\ndistant hospitals, often outside of\nLondon for 2 weeks). I emailed the\ncourse administrator explaining that\nif I were sent away from London I\nwould be unable to get to tutoring\njobs and thus be unable to make\nrent. I got a snide response detailing\nCollege\u2019s student employment policy.\nIt was clear that I was expected to\nprioritise our academic work. Fair\nenough \u2013 but if the entirety of my\nfunding amounts to less than basic\nliving expenses, I don\u2019t have a choice.\nDon\u2019t leave me with insufficient\nstudent grants and loans and get\nsnippy when I need to work to keep a\nroof over my head.\nI was already aware of the financial\ndifficulties facing fifth and final\nyears before I was elected to ICSMSU,\nhowever as soon as survey results\nstarted rolling in I saw it was worse\nthan I could imagine. For many of\nmy peers, it came as a shock, leaving\nsome students tied to rental contracts\nthat they simply couldn\u2019t afford. The\nsurvey found that 46.4% of students\nwere unable to cover their rent,\ndespite many working alongside their\nstudies. Surely it is unacceptable that\none of the wealthiest institutions in\nthe world is allowing this to happen?\nIt has been suggested that students\nsupported by their parents are at\na massive academic advantage by\nhaving time to study and maintain a\nwork-life balance. The current system\nwas built for the historic rich-kid\ndemographic of medical school.\nNow that more medics come from\nstandard middle class backgrounds\nfunding bodies need to adapt; we can\u2019t\nall turn to the Bank of Mum and Dad.\nMany students receiving parental\nsupport describe strained family\nrelationships and intense feelings of\nguilt for doing so.\nI was angrier than ever reading\nabout the impact to students\u2019\nwellbeing. Students are forced to\nput their studies, relationships and\nphysical health at risk in order to\nkeep their heads above water; some\nstudents\u2019 diets depend on how much\nmoney they have. Most shockingly,\nthere are some students who\nessentially starve themselves, going\nMany medics are forced to get part time jobs, such as working at the Reynolds Bar. Photo: Faculty of Medicine\nJennifer Watson asks whether the College offer enough support\nso far as to eat one meal a day just to\nmake ends meet. Mental health comes\ninto play as well. It\u2019s well known that\nmental illnesses like depression and\nanxiety disorders are a pertinent\nproblem in elite universities; the\nprevalence of anxiety and depression\nis even higher among medics. This\nis apparently being compounded by\nfinancial anxieties; some students\nhave been prescribed medication\n(anti-anxiety and anti-depressant\ndrugs) as a result of their financial\nconcerns. It doesn\u2019t take a genius\nto realise that all of this is bound to\nimpact students\u2019 grades.\nI am certainly not the only person\nto find this abominable. Consensus\namong ICSM students is that of anger\nand a deep dissatisfaction that they\nhave, as one person put it, been \u201cso\ngreatly let down by The System\u201c.\nThe Faculty of Medicine has also got\nbehind me and is looking into ways\nto keep the cost of living down for\nstudents, which will hopefully go\nsome way to alleviating the situation.\nAll I can do with what I have so\nfar is try to persuade Imperial to\nrestructure its bursary scheme and\nprovide more support to senior\nmedics. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t an\nadequate solution. An extension\nof the survey has revealed that the\nproblem is endemic in London\nmedical schools. Furthermore,\nanecdotal evidence suggests it is\nnationwide, implying that the cost\nof living in London is not the real\ncore of the issue. Addressing this at\nImperial leaves many thousands of\nmedics across the capital and the\nrest of the country stuck in the same\nsituation.\nFor me, the ultimate goal is top\ndown reform within Student Finance\nand the NHS. Student Finance\nmay have concerns about students\nfailing to repay their loans. Let\u2019s be\nhonest here, medics mostly have\na guaranteed job for life. There is\nvery little danger of them failing\nto pay off student loans. Imperial\ncontains some of the world\u2019s\nbrightest minds and is an incredibly\nwealthy institution, and yet medics\ncan\u2019t afford basic living costs while\nexercising our right to an education.\nAny such system is flawed.\nMedics and students in other\nhealthcare disciplines commit\ntheir entire working lives and make\nextensive sacrifices to providing an\nindispensable public service, and\nyet many are forced into illness and\nborderline poverty before they can\neven begin to give back to society. Is it\njust me, or is there an irony in that?\n\n"

Photo: Dominique Nabokov\nUnfortunately, this should come as\nno surprise. In 2012, the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD) reported that\nthe UK has some of the lowest social\nmobility in the developed world. It\nfound that social mobility in Britain\nhadn\u2019t changed since the 1970s and\nin some respects had gotten worse.\nWalter\u2019s words were echoed by Call\nthe Midwife actor Stephen McGann.\n\u201cSometimes today it feels like we\u2019re\ngoing the other way. Opportunities\nare closing down. If you\u2019re a messy\nkid from a council estate today, I\nthink the chances of you making it as\na successful actor are a lot worse than\nthey were.\u201d\nThose in leadership positions\nwithin the arts sector share such\nconcerns, with Dominic Dromgoole,\nartistic director of Shakespeare\u2019s\nGlobe Theatre, saying that the\n\u201cthinning of the social spectrum is a\nreal concern\u201d.\nThe question is: should we care?\nThe answer, emphatically, is yes.\nThis economic exclusion of the\npoorer sections of society leads to\nan exclusion of ethnic minorities,\nwho are more likely to come from\na lower socioeconomic group. With\nrecent census data showing that\nBritish society is becoming more\ndiverse than ever before, it seems\nodd that the arts, which are meant\nto reflect society, should go in the\nopposite direction. Crucially, cutting\nout of such a significant portion of\nour society from the arts not only\ndoes a disservice to the young artists\nand performers seeking to join the\nsector, but us, the consumers of\nculture as well. How can we get a\nvariety of voices when there is only\none group in the room? Do we really\nwant to engage with a culture that is\nincreasingly \u2018male, pale, and stale\u2019?\n\"Do we really\nwant to have\na culture\nthat is\nincreasingly\nmale, pale,\nand stale?\"\nFor many of us, the answer is no,\nand this is echoed by the statistics.\nIn 2013, Arts Council England\n(ACE) commissioned a report into\n\u201cequality and diversity within the\narts and cultural sector in England\u201d.\nIt found that the percentage of people\nengaging with the arts (including\nmuseums, theatres, galleries and\npublic libraries) at least once a year\nwas just 67.3% for those from a lower\nsocioeconomic group, in contrast\nover 85% of those from a higher\nsocioeconomic group engaged with\nthe arts. The report also showed\nthat with respect to audiences\nand participation in the arts the\ngap between Black and minority\nethnic people and white people has\nwidened. Research suggests that one\nmost common reasons that Black\nand minority ethnic people fail to\nengage is because of concerns about\nfeeling uncomfortable or out of place.\nAlienation of minority communities\nonly contributes towards deepening\nof divisions within society, and\ndisengagement with the arts can have\nsignificant impact on the rounded\ndevelopment of children, as well as\ntheir subsequent success in all areas\nof endeavour, including gaining\nadmission into top universities.\nIn December 2014, Sir Peter\nBalzalgette gave what he termed\n\u201cone of the most important speeches\nin his capacity as chairman of Arts\nCouncil England\u201d, announcing\na \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in the\norganisation\u2019s approach to increasing\ndiversity in the arts world. In his\ngalvanizing speech, he spoke of\nhow much of British culture has\nbeen shaped by \u201cthose who once\nstood outside \u2013 who have come to\nBritain from other countries, or\nthose whose perspective and voices\nhave not always been included in\nthe mainstream.\u201d He went on to cite\nartists who have categorically defied\nthe \u2018male, pale, and stale\u2019 stereotype,\nincluding Zadie Smith, whose novel\n\"Alienation\nof minorities\nonly\ncontributes\ntowards\ndeepening\ndivides in\nsociety\"\nWhite Teeth he said \u2018[best] described\nour society on the cusp of the new\nmillennium\u2019, Steve McQueen, the\nTurner prize-winning artist whose\nfilm Twelve Years a Slave was the\nfirst film produced and directed by\na black filmmaker to win an Oscar\nfor best picture, and Paul Cummins,\nthe disabled artist who created the\n\u201cextraordinary, elegiac display of\nceramic poppies around the Tower\nof London\u201d. He went to say that the\narts world was not \u201creacting fast\nenough to changes in society\u201d and\nneeded to reflect immigration as\nwell as the invisible parts of society\n\u2013 the disabled and the elderly,\nsaying \u201call need to be brought to the\nconversation\u201d.\nHis solution to the problem is the\n\u2018Creative Case for Diversity\u2019, a new\ntougher enforcement of the Equality\nActions Plan that legislates for\ndiversity. He said that ACE would\nbe publishing \u201cworkforce diversity\ndata for individual national portfolio\norganisations and major partner\nmuseums\u201d from 2015 and threatened\nthat unless the ACE-funded\norganisations make progress with\n\u201cthe diversity of their programmes,\ntheir audiences, their artist and their\nworkforce\u201d that there would be \u201ca\nreckoning\u201d. In short, their funding\nwould be axed, and the organisations\nremoved from ACE memberships\nfrom 2018.\nIt remains to be seen whether\nfunding cuts (or at least threats of\nsuch) can tackle a problem partially\ncreated by funding cuts, but from\nthis year big changes are expected\nto take place. Balzalgette ended by\nsaying \u201cyoung talent, whatever its\nbackground or class will see the kind\nof work that convinces them that\nthe arts belong to them -and that\nthey have a way in. We can\u2019t give\npeople creative talent. But we can and\nmust give those with talent creative\nopportunities.\u201d This sentiment at\nleast, we should all be able to agree on.\nTurner Prize winner artist and filmmaker, Steve McQueen, cited as someone who has shaped\nBritish culture by Sir Peter Balzalgette.

The Techtonics were\nfollowed by the all-male group from\nTrinity College, Dublin, known as the\nTrinitones, and the Accidentals, an\nall-female group from the University\nof St Andrews. The Accidentals came\nin third place.\nAll the King\u2019s Men were next up,\nwho won last year\u2019s Semi-Finals, and\nmade it to Boston for the Final in\n2014. This all-male group from King\u2019s\nCollege London won Outstanding\nArrangment for their set, alongside\nplacing first.\nAfter the interval, The Scopes and\nthe Imperielles, Imperial\u2019s own mixed\nand all-female groups respectively,\nalso performed, with Tammy\nHuggins, a second year Biochemist,\nlater winning Outstanding Soloist.\nThe Scopes delivered an impressive\nmash-up of top 90\u2019s hits, whilst the\nImperielles\u2019 set included exceptional\nrenditions of Sia\u2019s Chandelier and\na mash up of Massive Attack\u2019s\nTeardrop and Lorde\u2019s Royals.\nExeter\u2019s all-male group, SemiToned, delivered a brilliant rendition\nof Disney\u2019s I\u2019ll Make a Man Out of You\nand won the prize for Outstanding\nChoreography for their entire\nset, along with placing second.\nMeanwhile, Durham University\u2019s\nmixed group, the Northern Lights,\nwon the award for Outstanding Vocal\nPercussion for their entire set.\nThe MC\u2019s for the evening were the\nSon of Pitches, a former student a\nGreat Hall packed as hundreds lock\nto see the A Cappella Semi-Finals\nPhilippa Skett watches as the nine singing troupes take the to stage\ncappella group from Birmingham\nUniversity. They have since gone\nprofessional after getting to the ICCA\nFinals a few years ago.\nWhilst the judges deliberated,\nthey entertained the audience with\na half-hour set of their top hits,\nincluding an improvised song about\na \u201cbobsleighing manatee\u201d in the\nstyle of reggae-opera. Sadly, a second\npromised improvisation about\n\u201cerotic protractors\u201d was scrapped as\nthe judges returned to announce the\nresults.\nThey did manage to squeeze in a\nperformance of their latest single\nwith backings from a gospel choir\nknown as Sound, which featured\na Techtonics alumni (and Felix\ncentrefold star), Conrad Godfrey.\nThe Techtonics spoke to Felix\nafter the event. Peter Noden, the\nPresident said: \u201cThe evening was an\namazing experience for the group,\nperforming to a home crowd (who\nwere incredible!) and a chance to\nmeet up with old friends from other\ngroups. Afterwards we discovered we\nactually placed fourth overall - just\nmissing out on the top three.\n\u201cBut the group is not dwelling on\nthe outcome as we have a very busy\nyear ahead, with a second studio\nalbum in production and a summer\ntour to look forward to!\u201d\nThe Imperielles also spoke to Felix,\nand told us how much fun they had\non the night. \u201cAlthough the ICCAs\nwas a competition, the atmosphere\nwas extremely supportive, and it\nfelt more like a celebration of the\nimmense talent within UK a cappella.\n\u201cPerforming to such a large\naudience was really exciting, as\nImperial\u2019s Great Hall was packed\nto full capacity. The Imperielles are\nparticularly proud to have won the\naward for Outstanding Soloist which\nwent to Tammy. Imperielles are soon\nto be making a music video, so keep\nan eye out for that too!\u201d\nThe competition, hosted by the\ninternational organisation known as\nVarsity Vocals, is now in its 20th\nyear.\nAll the King\u2019s Men will be travelling\nto New York to compete in the Finals\nin April. It is not yet known who they\nwill be competing against as other\ngroups have yet to advance from their\nRegionals.\nFelix spoke to Matt Shirer, the\nInternational Producer of Varsity\nVocals, about the event, and how he\nthought it went. Shirer told us how he\nwas impressed with the high standard\nthe groups performing, and also just\nhow smoothly the event went on the\nnight.\nSaid Shirer: \u201cOver the years, I have\nseen groups elevate their level of\nmusical excellence and performance\nto truly incredible levels, and I\ncertainly expect we will see that in the\ngroups competing next year!\n\u201cWhile it took quite a bit of effort,\nseeing and hearing the reactions from\neveryone at the show easily justified\neverything that went into it.\u201d\nGeorge Rolls, from All The King\u2019s\nMen, said \u201cI would say we are\nparticularly happy as Saturday night\n9 out of 10 men on this stage are currently dating the Felix editor. Ok this is a lie Photo: Xuan\nChen\nwas the culmination of a few weeks\nof particularly hard work. We had\nlots of nice comments from alumni\nwho had performed with us at our 5th\nanniversary concert in October. We\nwould also like to pass our thanks to\nthe Tectonics, and Henry Harrod,\nwho did a great job of organising the\nevent and hosting us all!\n\u201cWe are starting a fundraising\ncampaign, as we would love to go\nto the finals in New York, but it is a\nconsiderable task to get the money\nto go, so we are all expecting to work\nvery hard over the next 2 months!\u201c\nThe Scopes said \u201cThe Scopes\nconsider their performance a success\nand intend to celebrate by eating a\nlot of cake and, in some cases, a lot of\ncheese.\n\u201cThis has been their biggest\nperformance to date and they are\nthrilled to have participated in such a\nmomentous and spectacular event.\u201d\nPlanning for the Semi-Final began\nin May last year, and has already\nbegun for Semi-Final in 2016.\n\n"
