Exhilarating as it\nma v be to stand illegally on the\nUnion roof and calculate the collision time and course for illegal\nfluid projectiles designed to meet,\nat the level, of the Beit quad,\nwith our worthy executive, it is\nquite inexcusable if it renders the\nquad totally unusable by college\nstudents and staff alike during a peak hour of the day. Just as inexcusable is the behaviour of the\n'lion-fed Christians' in the quad\nwho, last year at any rate, not only\ndistributed 30 gallons of glutinous\npancake mixture with random liberality over every available surface\nbut then omitted to have it removed from the walls of Beit Hall\nwhere it remained until the Maintainance Department removed it in\nthe summer vac.\nIf the Union executive wish to\ndemonstrate their awareness of the\nforthcoming lent fast may I respectfully suggest that they substitute\nfor this farce the selling of pancakes in the Union archway\u2014all\nproceeds to go to Carnival.\nR.J.

Spot the game Sir,\nMay I through your columns\nclear no a misunderstanding caused by the publication of a report\nheaded : \"Kings are defeated in\nfirst league game\" in your issue\ndated 18. 1. 67.\nThis report was placed next to\nyour soccer coverage on page 15\nand, while certain clues were given in the report to indicate which\nsport it referred to, a quick glance\nat the headline and, indeed, the\nreport itself, led to many people\nthinking that I.C. doubted K.C.L.' s superiority in the realm of soccer.\nThe correct facts are that King's1st soccer XI beat I.C. in a recent league match by 2 goals to\n0 and head the league with a100% record. They have also reached\nthe semi-finals of the U.L. U. Cup\nwhich they won convincingly last\nseasons\nIt would be an aid to your\nreaders, if, in future, it is made\nclear to which sport a report refers instead of merely giving the\nreader 'clues' such as 'quarter',\n'flick-on', and 'sent out.' I think\neven your Sport's Editor would admit that the other descriptions in\nthe report could equally well apply to soccer and the fact that\nthe I. C.1st XI does not have a mention in the adjacent article\nnaturally leads to this doubt.\nMeanwhile one must congratulate I.C. water-polo team on then-win although it is too early in the\nseason to be thinking of the\nleague title.\n.Michael R. Senior, Sport's Editor'\nEditorial Comment.\nThis unfortunate confusion arose\nbecause a sub-headline was not\nprinted. This would have pointed\nout that the article, in question,\nconcerned the I. C.v Kings water-polo match. Did you notice the\nerror in the headline on page 14 ?\nA. Robins\nDemagogic C. N.D. Malcolm Duckett, President of\nthe I.C.C. N.D. group and self-styled Union Officer on Vietnam,\nopened his much-vaunted, but\npoorly attended, Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting by lashing out\nwildly in all directions.\nHe accused the Union Executive\nfailing to act on Vietnam out of\nfear of loss of popularity and deplored the way they gave only\nfinancial assistance towards a publicity campaign on Vietnam. This\nwell-known, ginger y speaker went\non to criticise the apathy of students who were \"to dam self i ish to look away from their fat maintenance cheques and pints of beer\".\nHe called on the members of staff\nto give \"moral\" guidance ns well\nas teaching during their lectures\nby following the Americans' example of making comment on\nVietnam while lecturing. Leaving\nno stone un turned, he also attacked FELIX for accepting advertisments from the U.K. A. E.A. Mr. Duckett then made a long\nstatement on the morality of certain scientists. He referred to those\nwho \"took the wrong hi rr i ing\" by\nengaging in weapon research, and\nquestioned whether they should be\nallowed to control the direction of\nscientific research.\nNo change of\nname\nIt was decided not. to change\nthe name of the society to bring\nany reference to Vietnam in the\nnain e as it would mean further\nchanges when peace was achieved.\nOn Vietnam it was decided, after\na rambling discussion on the historic validity and legality of the\nVietnam governments which reminded unresolved, that the policy\nof the I.C.C. N.D. should be to\nsupport a return to the 1954 Agreement.\nResolved to\noppose\nIt was not until the questions\nof a photo display that might be\nheld at I.C. and the Orphans in\nVietnam Fund had been discussed\nthat the new Rector, Sir William\nPenney, was mentioned. There were\ncalls for a vote of no confidence,\nbu'j Pete Ruhemann called for this\nto be kept for a more opportune\nmoment. Bob Orr called for the\nsame delay, but expressed a point\nof view that seemed to coincide\nwith that of the old ladies knitting by the guillotine. Mr.\nBoothman presented a motion regretting the appointment of Sir\nWilliam Penney which Mr.\nRuhemann countered with a somewhat more general resolution. In\na fine spirit of compromise, both\nthe motions were carried. Mr.\nBoothman's resolution read: \"We\nregret the appointment as Rector\nof a man Who has by his work\non nuclear weapons not come up\nto the social and moral responsibilities that we believe society should\ndemand of scientists\". Mr. Ruhemann's counter-resolution read:\n\"I.C.C. N.D. believe that scientists\nshould show moral and social responsibility towards society in their\nchoice of employment and research;\nand will campaign to bring this\nquestion to the attention of students at I.C.\"K. Hall\nThe RCS tradition Soon seven R.C.S. students will\nbe appearing before two to three\nmillion viewers on American Television. These students took part\nin feasting and drinking scenes\nfilmed in the Elizabethan Rooms,\nQueen's Gate for KCRA News, a Galifornian television network, as\npart of a series of ten five-minute\news features on British traditional\ninstitutions.\nThe students became involved\nwhen two of their number, D. Brock and R. Bass, were accosted\nin Prince Consort Road by representatives of the British Travel Association and offered free drink to\nappear as extras in a film. In\norder to raise the required number\nof extras, they enquired in the\nPhysics library, where the indication of free alcohol soon raised a reasonable number, who then spent\nan hour being filmed drinking.\nAs can be imagined, little work\nwas done in the Physics library\nthat afternoon after the sb idents had returned.\n\n"

It is being\nrun from SOth January to 3rd. February and is being carried out\nin the Union Lower Refectory.\nThe survey is being conducted\nwith a detailed questionnaire which,\nit is hoped, everyone will fill in\nafter each meal.\nGeheral conclusions will be\ndrawn from the complete volume\nof -completed questionnaires, whilst\na smaller sample will be examined in detail. A major item of interest is to determine preference of students foi various\nstyles of cooking. Mister Harris,\na self-confessed refectory us-er, hopes to make a preliminary report to the Union\nCouncil as soon as possible.

Martha Gellhorn, who\nwrote the articles, described particularly the miseries of those\nchildren orphaned by war. The\nnumber of orphans in Vietnam rises steeply every day. In Saigon\nalone there are ten overcrowded\norphanages, and many more\nthroughout the rest of Vietnam, in\nthe North and South. The South\nVietnamese Government pays 12\npiast res a day for each child,\nwhich does not prevent general\nstarvation. Medical care, occ up at? ional therapy, any amusement are\nnot even dreamed of: hunger\nrules.\nAs a consequence of these art-i cles, a Vietnam Orphans Fund\nwas set up by Professor Brent of\nSouthampton University and\nothers from British Universities.\nAlready many universities have\ncontributed, and the fund has\nreached \u00a37,000. The money is\nthen distributed to orphanages .in\nboth North and South Vietnam by\nOxfam and Red Cross.\nA committee has now been\nformed at I.C. to raise a collection from staff and students here.\nWe hope to approach everyone individually within a few days and\nask for a contribution.

Their hand-out sets out\n\"what we believe to be a programme necessary for the interests\nof students for the removal of\nbarriers to a full and democratic\neducation, and for the greatest\ncontribution of students to society\nand social progress\" etc. etc. The\nleaflet contains statements^ on various aims of the alliance\u2014some of\nwhich seem rather obvious, for\nexample, \"Students should have\nthe right to complete control over\ntheir own unions and funds,\nwithout interference, to elect their\nown officers and determine their\nown policies\". Other statements\ntend to be rather sweeping\u2014\n\"Education must be classless, in-te grated,( not tripartite or binary)\nand comprehensive at all levels\"\n\u2014does this Kapply to University\nlevel as well V Another mystifying\ndemand was that \"college authorities should be more democratically\ncomposed to include representatives of students, non-professorial\nstaff and trade unions\". Students\non academic sub-committees, all\nright, but surely not on college\nauthorities (whatever that actually\nmeans\u2014it certainly implies a permanent institution in which the\naverage transitory student would\nbe worse than useless). And what\nexactly would trade unions do ?\nPolitically\nconcerned\nIn tact the whole tone of the\ndocument seems to suggest a greater concern with politics than\nwith student affairs. Later references imply that the Alliance is critical of the lack of effectiveness of\nthe National Union of Students\n(this opinion is shared by many\nother people, but in fact the\nUnion does a lot of useful work).\nAccording to Ian Wrigglesworth, a vice-president of NUS, it is splinter\ngroups like RSA that have dama g ed- the reputation of NUS severely\u2014mainly of course because of\ntheir extreme left-wing supporters.\nreceived on Daily Express telephoto equipment via Jodrell Bank from\n4he Russian Luna 9. was printed on paper specially developed by\nWiggins Teape.\nPaper is a vital world commodity and The Wiggins Teape\nGroup is a major force in the paper industry.

Union meeting was taken up by a discussion of the academic involvement of R.C. S.U.R.E. Mack man( Physics rep) reported on a survey he had conducted to enquire into the standard of lecturing etc. As a consequence he had written to the head of the department for an interview. Paul Forster( Chemistry Rep) said that the R.C.S. General Committee had decided at the end of year to setup academic subcommittees in all departments, and that these had progressed well, Mr Fuchs suggested that those committees were not militant enough and should\" encourage mass involvement by all students\", Mr Lack said he thought it was most important for the Union to gain, the respect of the staff by taking an interest in academic affairs. Paul Forster and Bob Mack man were elected to have a special resp on sibi l ty for academic affairs. Guild's Union Meeting The first Guild1s Union Meeting of the term v/as held yesterday.

The Canadian Broadcasting Company came to I.C. for fifteen minutes at lunchtime on Tuesday, to film the student reaction to the current anti American photographic exhibition. The interviewer spent ten minutes talking to people around the exhibition, including Malcolm Duck ett, responsible for bringing it to I.C. In general most people seemed to find the photographs heavily biased although Duck ett pointed out that the purpose of the exhibition here was more to rouse people's opinions on the subject, than to simply s way them against the Americans. Judging by the crowd and its comments, this has happened, though the method is questionable.

    "content": "FELIX 15\nRUGBY CUP W l After their recent press coverage, the Hoyal Free Hospital\nRigby team appeared a rather awesome stepping stone in the IC\nside's quest to regain that historically IC possession, the\nGutteriSge cup. However, unlike St. Thomas' Hospital, \"O 'Reilly's Mounted Foot\" showed no signs of pity for a rather uni mag in at ive, fit, R.F. H. side.\nThe atmospheric conditions were radish-like, hot with a bit of wind,\nbut the pitch was wet and heavy after much overnight rain.\nIC kicked off with the wind and nan on their backs and kept up a steady pressure, pinning the Hospital back in their own 25. The referee\ntor a spate of sportsmanship penal is ed Powell four times for hooking in-fc ln gem ents, each time safety out of range of the IC goal. In the early\nstages the honours in the forward battle were fairly even, but through\nthe excellent service of Pin* at scrum-half the IC backs were given\nample room to show their skills.\nThe spectators we ne treated to a feast of fast moving 3/4 movements\u2014\nse is or s, dummy scissors and many other i in pro vis at ions. Architects in this\nfils pia y were Browlea (Richmond & IQ and e Kl ry(( Eoow Vale and IC)\n\u2022hose efforts made the opposition foot very mediocre. Somehow a score\nfailed to materialise until after 30 minutes Molam joined in the battle\nwith two very good penalty kicks, wide out on the 25. At half time the\nscore stood at 6-0 with IC turning to face into a fairly strong wind in\nthe second half. A change of tactic was immediately obvious. As a result of growing forward possession, Pine had been instructed to work\nthe touch line until an attacking position was achieved.\nIt was such an operation that the Hospital *.won the ball from the\nline bu only to see Powell brilliantly retain possession after charging\ndown a kick and miking much ground before giving Riley the pleasure\nof running in unopposed. Molam failed to convert.\nThe opposition lacked imagination and failed to use the high ball\ndown the middle. Instead, they invariably found touch thus bringing\nthe game back to IC. Another penalty for offside in a set scrum gave\nMolam the opportunity to score his third goal from an awkward position.\nFinally, as a just ref ard for all his hard work and skill, Brownlea ran\na full 40 year ds beating six or seven men on the way to give Riley his\nsecond ti y of the match. Again Molam had no chance with the\nconversion.\nIC thus finished the game good 15-0 winners. For those 30 or 40\nspectators present it had been an excellent afternoon's Rugby. For those\nwhe didn't go, I believe that \"Ginge\" has got together a team which will\nbring the UL cup back to IC, so lets see you there at the semi-final\nagainst CEM. \"\nThose who appeared in this display were: Molam, Chappel, Brownlee,\nKelly, Riley, Mills, Pine, Dodson, Williams, O 'Reilly, Lum, Vickerstaff,\n'\nas c rw n Prwxmll {~\\rw r u?v Casson, Powell, Cooper.\nWritten by B. Mair\nVICTORY\nAND\nDEFEAT\nIN THE U.L. U. league cup\nsoccer semi-finals, the college\n3rds beat Q. M.C.3r dh40, and\nthe 4th s lost 3-1 to UjC. 3rds. The fourth eleven game was one\nof those that is best forgotten, as\nthey previously beaten U.C.52, in a league game. However, the\ncollege were a goal down after\nfive minutes, and this bad start\nunsettled the team. Eventually the\nnerves were better and the college started to at lack, but found\nthe going hard in, and near to, the\npenalty area. Better finishing\nmight have leveled the scores, but\nas it was, U.C. turned round in\nthe lead.\nAfter the interval U.C. took the\nupper hand, more or less, and\nshould have been awarded a penalty. For a while the game\ndegenerated into a bit of a brawl.\nWhen this had subdued, I.C. threw everything into attack, with\ndisaster o us consequences. It was\nthen that the opposition scored\ntwice, following breakaway s, setting up a three goal lead. I.O. tried hard tc reduce the margin,\nand to a certain extent were successful. One goal was milled\nback, through Caldwell, but time\nwas not on their side. The final\nwhistle blew and the fourths were\nout of the cup.\nIN CONTRAST to the fourth\nthe 'thirds moved comfort e bly) through to the semi-finals, with a convincing win over Q.M. C.3 rds at Harrington. The college won\nthe toss and were faced with a stiff breeze for the first half. However, the defence dealt completely\nwith the attacks mounted by\nQ.M. C. in this period, and just before half-time it became the at-tack's turn. A perfect right-wing\ncross from Well/air was met by\nthe head of Perry, and IC turned\nround with a one goal lead\nIn the second-half, with the\nwinds at their backs, IC attacked\nstrongly and added three more\ngoals, all score by Horlock. The\nscore could well have been\ndoubled, as the college wingers\nhad the ability to split the Q.M. C. defence. In fact, the ball was\ntwice more put in the net\u2014both\nbeing disallowed, and later a penalty was missed.\nTlte team now look forward to\nthe next round with high hopes,\nas it is against U.C.2 nds \u2014a team\nthat the thirds have already beaten twice m the league.\nR. France\nWATER POLO\nBOTH ICs water polo teams\nwere successful in their last gam-es; the 1st team beating Q.M. C.1st, and the 2nds defeating St.\nMary's2 nds. The first team, playing their second game in the\nleague, should have won by a rather greater margin. Perhaps the\nmediocre performance was due to\nover confidence, resulting from\ntheir good win in the previous\nleague game.\nJUDO, NARROW VICTORY The Judo team had their revenge Over Birmingham! University on\nSaturday 21st. January, after losing to them last term. It was a very close\nmatch, the result depending on the final contest.\nP. Crossby and R. Butler won\nthe first two contests for I.C., each\nsecuring a hold-down, for a full\npoint. M. Reilly fought next and,\nas he often does, produced a beautiful text-book throw. This\ntime it was a foot-sweep, taking his\nman right oft the ground for a full\npoint\nI.C. were soon in a strong posit-ion, three wins up. B.U., however,\nwon the next three contests, with\ntwo hold-downs and a well-timed\nstomach throw. The teams were\nnow level, with two contests to\ngo. R. Jackson was the next on to\nOke mat and after attacking hard,\nmanaged to knock his opponent to\nthe ground with a hip-throw,\nscoring a half point.\nThe last contest was a very exerting fight between K. Glover\n(I.C.), the College's First Dan,\nand the B.U First Dan an\nAmerican. The American was\nvery experienced and once looked\nnear to getting a hip-throw, but\nGlover defended well and was soon\nattacking hard. Indeed, he once\nmanaged to knock his man onto\nhis side with a sacrifice throw,\nbut without scoring. The final result of this fight was a draw, and\nI.C. had won by half a point.\nThe next fixture is against\nOxford, (at home) on February\n11th. As they were the only other\nteam to beat I.C. last term, another revenge is being sought.\nR. Jackson\nSUCCESS ACROSS COUNTRY THE THREE cross-country\nmatches, so far this term have\nshown the strength, and particularly the high standard, of the college\nrunners. First, on Sat. 14th Jan.,\na clear win over Sussex, L.S.E. and U.C. on -a hilly course, over\nthe South Downs.

The\nCafe Andre is the home of the\nacting type, the English department and anyone in need of a four\no 'clock martini. The third es-tabl ish ment, and by far the best,\nis the Swiss Hut\u2014filled round the\nclock with anarchists, separatists,\ncommunists, prostitutes, drug addicts and, of course, drunks.\nThe Swiss Hut offers a liberal\neducation rivalling that of most\nuniversities, and all for the price\nof a bottle of beer. It is regrettable that most McGill students do\nnot discover it until they are\ngraduate students.\nIn any serious essay on McGill\nthe fraternities should be mention-ed. They exist and in their well\nworked out social structure, you\nfind gie at numbers of jolly, beer-drinking chaps. The fraternity\nhouses specialise in various aspects\nof campus life. Those that have\ncontrol of the student government,\nare known as 'respectable houses;\nthose that ex cell in fornication are\nreferred to, and I suspect enviously,\nas animal houses'\nIt is difficult to communicate\nwhat McGill is, what the atmosphere is and how alive it is. It\nis impossible to get through the\nday without at least one debate\non the student's role in the univers-it y, commitment to education, or\n>\nn what is going on at Berkeley\nit is impossible to stroll across the\ncampus without encountering\ncharming females, or perhaps a group of people listening to an\nirate student sublimating on his\nsoapbox.\nThe student government, be it\nright or left wing, is the constant\nvictim of the McGill Daily, and\nthe editor of the Daily is ever on\nthe verge of being fired for being\na communist, or irresponsible, or\nsomething.\nThere is the conservative and\nscholarly side. Stephen Seacock\nwas a McGill professor and had\nRutherford stopped on his way to\nCambridge. James McGill, the\nfounder, is buried in front of the\nArts building. McGill has a long\nhistory of producing great Canadians and will probably go on doing\nso no matter what it, or the\ngovernment, does to stop it.\nAmong the many guests at\nI.C. this week from the London\njazz scene is Humphrey Lytte1\n-ton who will be giving a General Studies lecture called :\n\"The Sound of Jazz\", tomorrow (Thursday) in Mech. Eng.\nLecture Theatre at 1.30 p.m. Humphrey Lyttelton comes from\none of the oldest families in\nEngland. His first ancestor of note\nwas Humphrey Lyttelton who was\nhanged drawn and quavered for his\npart in the Guy Fawkes pint to\nblow up Parliament. Otlidi ie leb rated forebears were Lord George\nL>tte lton a politician and minor\npoet; Alfred Lyttelton, Secretary\nof State for the colonies in Lord\nBalfour's Government; Arthur\nLytteLton, former Bishop of Pretoria; Edward Llttelton, former master of Eton College and Neville\nLyttelton, Chief of the Imperial\nGeneral Staff. His second cousin\nOliver Lyttelton, now Lord\nChandos, was Minister of Production in Churchill's Wartime Government and his first cousin,\nViscount Cobham, was, until re-cent ly. Governor General of New\nZealand.\nHumphrey Lyttelton was born\non May 23rd1921, educated at\nEton College, where his father\nwas a famous house master for\nmany years. During the war he\nserved as an o if ice r in the Grenadier Guards and on discharge he\nstudied for two years in art\nschool. In 1949 he joined the\nLondon Daily Mail as a cartoonist\nremaining for five years.\nHe formed his first jazz band i \u00bb\n1948, after spending a year vii th George Webb's Dixielanders, a band specialising in New Orleans\nJazz. The Humphrey Lyttelton\nBand soon became the leading\ntraditional jazz band in Britain,\nwith a high reputation in Europe\ngained through tours to Switzerland, Holland, Germany, and\nScandinavia.\nIn 1949 his band had the distinction of being chosen to record\non the Melodise label with the\ngreat Sidney Bechet. In 1955 his\ncomposition, \"Bad Penny Blues\"\nwas the first British j'azz record to\nget into the' Top Twenty.\nLEADER on\nBRITISH JAZZ SCENE\nHe has written two autobiographical books\u2014\"I Play as I Please and \"Second Chorus\" As\na journalist he has contributed regularly to Melody Maker and\nother leading jazz publications, as\nwell as writing i;re gul a i column\nfor the London Sunday Citizen for\nthe past seven years. He also\nwrites a syndicated weekly article\nfor Provincial newspapers and contributes regularly to the Spectator.\nHumphrey Lyttelton was presented as one of the subjects in\nthe B.B.C. television show \"This\nis Your Life\".

    "content": "FEL\">:\nMascot ry con t'd.1 am ret erring to that despicable\nincident, which overran the bounds\nor decency, and concerns the\nGPO Tower. Already many unsuspecting members ot the public\nhave been directly affected, ridiculed, even savaged, as a result of\nthis invisible danger to human\nwell-being.\nThe sparrows, which now roost\non top of this monumental hazard,\nhave been observed closely by\nseveral distinguished ornithologists.\nMany are staking their reputations\non a theory, worked out with the\nco-operation of that famous\nph y ici st McGooo of McGoon,\non a general theory of levitation;\neach night in the interests of\nscience t ney undergo ridicule from\ntheir wives. (Not McGoon of\nMcGooii; his harem is too well\nbehaved). What is more, one bird\nspotter had to be put away because the sight of a sleeping\npigeon disturbed him. If he had\nsat still like the sparrows it would\nhave been all right, but this pigeon\nslept whilst missing a glorious\npanoramic view as he was rotated\nevery half hour, while supposedly\nhe should have been eating his\nbird-seed (at highly exorbitant\nprices). In this way the W.H.O. are\ndirectly responsible for burdening\nthe English asylum with another\nincurable, wasting valuable straw\nspace, and misusing the precious\ntime of England's already overworked hospital zoo.\nMy final contention is also one\nof a highly frustrating nature.\nNymphomaniacs (Latin for telephone operators) keep saying\ndelightful things in my ear, but\nall I sense are voices (such are the\npowers of RAPE). Even if I knew\nroughly where these voices were, I still would have great difficulty in\npinning them down, so could\nsomeone possibly de-RAPE them.\nM.R. Bellchambers\nEd : Two paragraphs have been\ncut from this imaginative but long\nletter. *Fhe original may be seen\non request.\nUnfair to Tapir Sir,\nWe, being members of the\nabove mentioned Union (Northern\nPolytechnic & National College of\nRubber Technology Students\nUnion) are perturbed about the\ngross misrepresentation of the\nfacts pertaining to the removal of\nour \"Tatty Tapir' as reported in\nyour organ. Those responsible for\nits abduction have, to our dismay,\ntaken great pains to make it appear that our mascot was removed\nduring Union hours. To this end,\nthey produced a photograph showing the completion of the raid at\none minute past nine our time,\nbut which they claimed was two\nminutes behind G.M.T. As our Union opens at 9.00 a.m., do they .seriously maintain that\nthey entered the building, climbed\nonto the first floor, cut through the\n'case hardened steel chains' and\nremoved said mascot to the street\nin 3 minutes ? If this were true\nthen we congratulate them on\ntheir efficiency.\nHowever, certain facts remain:\u2014\n1. The raiders were challenged by\na porter inside the closed gates of\nthe college on or about 8.30 am.\n2. When our Secretary arrived at\n9.00 am., she was told by a member of the cleaning staff that the\nmascot had gone. Immediate inspection proved this to be so.\nAccording to Page 3 of 'Sennet'\n(January 17th,1967), your college\nhave made a terrible fuss about\nthe removal of MIKE outside\nUnion hours and are considering\ntaking legal action. Surely this represents hypocrisy of the highest\norder ? And how would I.C. feel\nif we were to consider legal action.\nWe would very much like this\nletter to be published since we\nare sure that your paper, as do\nmost others, wishes to give a true\nrepresentation of the facts.\nB.J. Bull\nVice-President of Internal Affairs\nSir,\nIn reply to Mr. Bull's letter I would like to make the following\npoints :\u2014\u2022\n1. The 'raiders' that the porter\nchallenged were, in fact, merely\nthe advance party that went in tc\nmake sure that the Tatty Tapir\nwas there to be removed. The\nmain party went in via another\n(open) door about 15 minutes later.\n2. Just because the Secretary did\nnot see the mascot in its usual\nplace at 9.00 a.m. was no reason\nto assume that it was no longer\non Union property\u2014which is what\nmatters for it can be no offence\nto move a mascot from one part\nof the Union to another. Had she\nhad the sense to execute an immediate search of the area near\nthe emergency exit from the\nlounge in which the Tapir was\n\u2022kept she would have found the\nraiders and the Tapir quite easily.\nI state again that not only were\ntheir clocks slow but disagreed\nwith one another and that Horace\nwas moved at two minutes past\nnine G.M.T. The promise made to me by, I think, their President, to follow up\nthe clues and pay a sum of money\nto our Gharity Carnival at the-end, has not yet, to the best of\nmy knowledge, been kept.\nPresident W.H.O. SPASM vS P UNCLE Sir,\nI hear that the Bishop of Bath\nand Wells, together with three\nM.P.'s, has formed SPUNCLE; the\nSociety for the Protection of UNborn Children, to oppose the latest\nParliamentary Bill intended, to reform the laws on abortion. The\nidea that a fertilised human ovum\npossesses some spiritual property\n(usually called a soul) which the\nsperm and ovum separately do not\npossess, seems to me so fatuous that\nI don't see how any rational person could sincerely affirm it.\nI would like, therefore, to point\nout to these sincere and rational\npeople, that their society is not\nbasic enough, and to invite them\nto help me form SPASM; the Society for the Protection of ovA and\nSperM. This Society would campaign for the introduction of life\nsentences for homosexuals, lesbians,\nusers of non-hormonal cont race pt ives, mast ur bator s and abortionists;\ncompulsory marriage at puberty for\nevery male; compulsory use of the\nPill (it stops - ovulation) by all unmarried females and compulsory use\nof Thalidomide by all married\nwomen. (Perhaps you didn't know\nthat Thalidomide doesn't itself deform a foetus, but suppresses the\nnormal destruction of a deformed\nfoetus by the womb).\nThere will still be problems of\ncourse, like the fact that conception is a hit-or-miss process, and\nthat there are millions of sperm for\nevery ovum, but at least every\nsperm and ovum will have a sporting chance of meeting their counter-parts.\n1 just hope that the men from\nSPUNCLE have an answer to the\nPopulation Explosion.\nIn last weeks hitter, a phrase\nthree-quarters of the way down the\ncolumn should have read: \"...and\nchunks of a course being cut out\nof an exam syllabus without anyone being (officially) told.\"\nThe author is not responsible for\nmost of the punctuation errors, or\nfor any of the spelling mistakes.\nI actually liked the Union Meeting a la Duke. For a change I got the impression that the Executive was there in order to do some-thing. Keep it up.\nWish I could stop worrying\nabout those two \u00a3100 candelabra,\nthough. I'm not really worried\nabout the flippant way in which\nwe are told that one of the Union\ncandelabras had got broken, was\ntaken to some department to be\nrepaired and then disappeared.\nAfter all, who cares about \u00a3100 ?\nIt's the precedent that worries me.\nWhy were two placed on order\nwhen on lv one disappeared ? Now\nthat MIKE has gone AWOL, are\nwe going to have to make two\nmore of him ? What would happen if Tony Duke were kidnapped?\nI'd also be interested to know\nwhether the police have been in-formed, and if so, with what result ? Were the candelabra in sur ed, and if not. why not? And of\ncourse, can't the Refectory Committee find an v thine more worthwhile to spend \u00a3200 on; like improving the refectories, or contributing to Andy Jordan's SASF ?\nTalkipt of SASF, was it reasoning or feelings of guilt that made\nthe Union support it ? I am\nrather incredulous of the argument\nthat an I.C. educated student will\nbe just what the black South\nAfricans need when the \"crunch\"\ncomes. Judging by events in the\nCongo, Nigeria, Ghana, and\nRhodesia, a politician-cum-soldier\nwould be of rather more use. But\nI still support the gesture. I hope\nthat no one has any illusions about\nit being more than just that.\nNow that cultural relations are\nabout to begin with N. Vietnam,\nhow about trying to exchange\nsome I.C. students for Vietcong ?\nThink of the attractions; sniping\nat Americans, and torturing and\nmurdering harmless civilians. In re-turn, we could teach the Vietcong\nto play cricket, Tr Poohsticks, or\nsomething. Stand by for a full-page advert in FELIX : \"SUPPORT\nHO CHI MINH.\"\nOtoli\nCro s land's nonsense Sirs,\nOn Tuesdav, 17th January, Mr\nCrosland made two points in his\ndefence of the move to direct the\nUniversities to compulsorily increase the fees of overseas students\nfrom the present \u00a385 to \u00a3250. The\nfirst was that the Government will\nstill be sub sidi sing the fees to the\nsame extent as they did five years\nago. The second is that the students whom this scheme is supposed\nto affect are those from the United\nStates and th\u00ab White Domiuion\ncou ii cries. in co ii jun CLio nw it n me\nsecond po me lie stated that the\nGovernment will De aiding\ngovernments \" ot underdeveloped\ncountries who' sponsored students\nv. ui oe altu c ted oy such a scheme\nne gard u ig the n rst poul t, what Mi\nCrosiand said is sheer nonsense\nit is true that the cost ot living\nhas gone up since five years ago,\nbut it certainly has not gone up\nby 300% as an increase from \u00a385\nto iJ ZoO, with the Government still\nsub sidi sing co tile same extent,\nwould imply.\nComing to the second point, Mr\nCrosland himself admitted that\nthis move is unpopular, and will\nalso cause a lot of hardships for\nindividual students from the developing countries. A mere admission is not enough. If the scheme\nis supposed to be aimed at students from the US and the Dominion\ncountries, then why not limit the\nincrease to these students alone :\nWhy should the students from the\nCommonwealth and other developing countries be hit as well i It\nis no good refunding the increases to those Commonwealth Governments whose scholarships students\nwill be hit. The proportion of\noverseas students who are on their\ngovernments' grant is very small.\nMany of us pay our way through\nUniversity. Such an increase of\nfees will therefore hit those of us\nwho least deserve it and who can\nleast afford it. May I also point\nout that the money that would accrue from us will do the country\nlittle good as this will only cover\na negligible percentage of the education bill.\nTan Fob.

What a magnificent quotation from the Chairman of the FELIX Board, even\nmore interest ng when one considers that he is not responsible,\nfor the formation of the policy of the paper. In general he is\ncorrect; FELIX does not oppose the Union, yet on the other\nhand it is not the voice of the Executive and should not be expected to agree with them in every case. It will always provide\na mouthpiece on this page for any member of the Union to\nexpress his op m 'on; in Colcutt it will provide a critic of the\nUnion who can express himself freely.\nIt the President tee is it necessary, as he did recently, to check the\nactions of the Editor, to approve the editing of certain articles and\nto remind the Editor to exercise discretion, then something is wrong.\nThe Editor is appointed by the Board and is should then be his job\nalone to direct the policy of the paper. If the Board dislikes the\npolicy, it holds the power to dismiss him.\nThat Organisation ion y Duke recently met lan Wrigglesworth, a Vice-President of the\nNU.S., and spent several hours talking with him. Perhaps the most\namusing part of this meeting was the pride Tony displayed in showing\noff the Union facilities, both present and future. When a student from\nanother college arrives at I.C. the range and qu ali it y of the Union\nfacilities and the Halls of Residence must create an excellent impression\nof the College which we tend to miss.\nIt is a pity that some of this excellent reputation must be lost by\n?he bad publicity acquired by the Wooden Horse Organisation. It is\nnot the loss of face (and money) occasioned, by the removal of MIKE,\nthough other London Colleges often consider I.C. to be too arrogant,\nbut rather the unfortunate incident at City University recently. After\nconversations with various members of the Organisation and the report\nin Beacon, their newspaper, I am hardly surprised that the police were\nbrought in. They should consider diem selves lucky that no action has\nbo en brought. The report in Beacon, written by an indignant Union\nmember, will be seen in many Universities and Colleges throughout\nthe country\u2014it reads like a report of vandalism.\nAlso under the general nea ding of vandalism comes the current treatment of the Union call-boxes. It is now the exception rather than the\nrule to find one or more of these telephones out of order following tampering by 'playful' members of the Union.\nRevolutionary Union meeting! Would you believe it! An I.C. Union meeting adjourned 1 This\nmethod was proposed last term to allow disc is sion on the Carnjval\ncharities but it was not followed up. Still, the precedent has been set;\nif Union meetings can be known by all Union members to be worth\ncontinuing in this way, then perhaps we may do more than hover on the\nlimit of quo racy. LetUw to fB HX More masc c try Sir,\nDoes FELIX not know that a member of staff died during the\nvacation ?\nPerhaps FELIX considers such\nnews boring, but feels quite happy\nfollowing the history of every\nLondon mascot. If FELIX is now\nmore interested in mascot ry than\nin letting us know what goes on\nhere, it should go the whole hog\nby changing its name to 'Mascotry'.\nF.A. Okoh\nSir,\nOne again the Wooden Horse\nOrganisation have acted with a total lack of responsibility, which\ndoes not go without precedence on\ntheir part. This time they have\ngone too far. In the interests of\nt ne still good name of Imperial\nCollege they should be disbanded,\nand their activities cease forthwith.\nIn what I am about to outline, I am sure that I will have the\nopinion of the more responsible\npersons of this College behind me.\nCont'd "

SULLIVAN\nThanks to the skill of president Touy Duke, the recent union\nmeeting was able to cover a large amount of work despite the\nwidespread disinterest in it Quorum was finally achieved in the\nfirst meeting after more than half the business had been comp let ed. The number of motions to be covered and the newly intro dnc ed question-time necessitated the meeting being adjourned to the\nfollowing Thursday.\nThe report on the means test,\nwhich was commissioned last June\nduring the debate oil the loans\nlobby, was pie sent od', by PeteFinch, the Welfare \u00a9racer. His\nfigures were based on' a question-aire distributed last term\u2014\u2022most of\nthe 107 peoples came from the\nPhysics dept. Very few conclusions emerged from the disinterested presentation except that 7/2%\nof students at IC receive less than\n\u00a3330 p.a. compared to the recommended \u00a3370. A motion,\ndown for debate later in the meet-ing, to set up a committee to\nlook into this, was mentioned.\nPenney: likeable and friendly' Sir William Penney, upon taking up his appointment as Rector\nin October, can be expected to\nimpart to the college a great deal\nof his drive and enthusiasm, and\nto bring the constituent parts of\nthe college more closely together.\nIt is thought that he will fake a considerable in te\\) st i in i student\naffairs as he will in everything\nthat goes on in the college. Lady\nPenney can also be expected to contribute a great deal to the social\nactivities of the college. Sir\nWilliam is' a likeable and friendly\nperson and has been held in great\nrespect by everyone who has\nworked with him.\nA member of the Physics Department who worked under him\nat the Atomic Weapons Research\nEstablishment ad Aldermaston\nsays that, when he left, the place\nseemed to lose a sense of purpose\nand direction. His large capacity\nfor oi gan is ation and co-ordination\nhelped to build up A.W. R.E.; Imperial College can be expected to\nbenefit greatly from this.\nPaul Heath\nQuestion time\nThe problem of student parking was the subject of a question\nanswered by Brendan Parker, ICU\nsecretary. He reported that attempts had been made to obtain\nconcessions, \\ including Resident\nst a us for all members of the col-leg e. However the Kensington &\nChelsea Council have, as yet, no\ndefinite plans for the area and so\nno rulings can be given. It seems\nlikely, however, that Imperial\nIstitute road will be closed to\nstudents\u2014under Sir Patrick\nLinstead it was a \"first come, first\nserve\" area. Brendan maintained\nthat the Union had been allotted\na few reserved parking spaces; any\none with a special need for a car\nshould apply to him.\nMr Jordan was assured by\nTony Duke that he could inspect\nthe council minutes in the Union\noffice; and reminded that constituent college representatives and\ntwo FELIX reporters were present at each meeting.\nThe meeting had now reached\nqua racy and the minutes were\nsigned.\nICS ASAF The first motion, to set up a fund of \u00a32000 to educate a South\nAfrican Student who, because of\nthe colour of his skin, would not\notherwise receive an fC university\neducation, was proposed by Mr\nGarga, an impassioned and well-informed speaker. There was little discussion from the floor and\nnone on where the money was to\ncome from. Mr Colin Stuart\nq nest i one d some of Mr Garga's facts but the feeling of the meeting was in favour of the motion,\nwhich 'wi as carried overwhelming-ly. The task of raising the money\nwas left to Andy Jordan and Mr\nBellchambers.\nThe meeting then moved on to\nan Executive Motion, proposed by\nMr Brendan Parker, to the effect\nthat it deplored the Government's move to raise fees for\nforeign students. Mr Parker's proposal speech, was, in fact, quotations from various letters to\n\"The Times\" and a letter from\nMr McDowall. He also made the\npoint that the motion was really\nconcerned with students from underdeveloped countries\u2014not, say,\nfrom the USA.\nThis motion, also, was carried\nby the somewhat smug meeting.\nThe meeting being in quo rate Mr Fuchs moved an adjournment\nand accepted Tony Duke's suggestion of Thursday. He also\npleaded for publicity for the adjourned meeting.\nWhen the meeting opened on\nThursday some 60 people were\npresent. The remaining motion,\nconcerning tire means test and\nproposed by Frank Fuchs, could\nnot therefore be debated. Mr\nReich now stood, and said that\nquality, not quantity, was what\ncounted and so the motion should\ncontinue. At this point Ray\nPhillips, ACC Chairman, sprang\nto his feet to propose that Mr\nReich therefore be asked to leave,\nthis motion being carried un-a nimo us ly. Tony Duke then expressed the\nExecutive's disapproval of IC's vandalism ;vt other col legs and informed the mee Sng of the loutish\nbehaviour reported by City University. He also requested better\nbehaviour in the Southside bar.\nMr Boothman raised the matter\nof IC representation at a lobby\norganised by RSA on the subject\nof overseas students* fees. He, Mr\nCavanagh and Mr Nirfm Som\nwere duly elected as represent at ives, after Tony Duke had ascertained that Mr Bootliman was pre-sent.\nAndy Jordan suggested that, due\nto the large ammo imt of outstanding business, the next Union meeting be held in three rather than\nsix weeks. The Executive agreed\nto consider this and they later decided to hold one on Tuesday 2f st February.\nA1SO\nIN THIS ISSUE:\nRadical Student Alliance p.2 Letters to FELIX . p.4,5,10 McOllI p.8 Humphrey Lyttelton ... p.9 Teaching Week ... . p.11/ "

    "content": "16 FELIX\nAFTER THE FREEZE\nPolitical Societies Teach in FELIXW\nEEK END CHINA TODAY\nOne opinion While I.C. wrangles about the Means Test for British students,\nthis test is accepted as necessary in Red China. Chinese students\nare selected by a regional board and usually go to a University\nin a different region from their home region. Most of the Universities are almost wholly residential and prospective students\nare permitted to state an order of preference but this usually\nmeans that they do not get their first choke.\nThese are some of the aspects of Chinese life revealed in\nsome unedited films shown recently by Mr. Bill Bruggers of the\nSchool of Oriental and Afr'can Studies. He had recently returned\nfrom China with accounts of the current cultural revolution after\nspending two years teaching English. Although the films were\nunedited and Mr. Bruggers' answers were frank, his pro-Chinese\nstance was easily detectable.\nIdeology and politics are, as is\nwidely known, an integral part of\nthe Chinese life, but even science\nand engineering students are subjected to political theory and propaganda during their courses.\nEveryone is aware that Westminster is an outpost of Capitol\nHill, that the Indians are Americans in disguise and that the Russians are now a very pale red as\na result of revisionist winds from\nthe West. Dickens -is the favourite English author since it is in\n'Dickensian England that] people\ndo not have enough to eat.\nCultural Revolution\nOn the cultural revolution, Mr.\nBruggers took the view that it is\nnot ,as frightening and disturbing\nas the Press makes it out to be.\nHe sees it as an effort to slow\ndown the pace of the growth of\nthe bureaucratic machine. He asserts that the Chinese have come\nto realise that the aim of ultimate\ndecentralisation, the; esta blis i'ii mien t of 'actual Communism', cannot be\nrealised by increased initial centralisation and bureaucracy. This,\nhe thought, was the chief cause of\nthe cultural revolution, though big\nhead-hunting is its natural and\nmajor by-product.\nRed Guards\nHis films and comments made\nit clear that the Red Guards are\nnot organised but are in fa\u00abta result of spontaneous enthusiasm.\nHe thought that the Red Guard\nrallies were treated by many as\na good chance to see Peking and\nto generally 'nave fun'. The Red\nGuard rally shown in the film was\nof a2 \u00b1 million strong march-past\nlasting five hours, which took place\nin Peking during the early days of\nthe cultural revolution. In this film\nof the first few days of the cultural revolution in Shanghai and\nPeking one could see that the\nRed Guards were all very happy\nyoung people, not at all like the\nimage of the poker-laced blue-overall ed Chinese hordes that one\ngenerally gets from press reports.\nBreath-taking\nA pleasant diversion was provided by one film showing the\nvaried landscape of China, some\nviews being as breath-taking as\nthose of the Grand Canyon. In\none of the more remote reg ibn s he\nclaimed to have spent the night at\nthe foot of a huge statue in a temple in the company of contemplatives quite untouched by\nthe outside world. The people had\nnot come down from their high\nabodes for eighteen years; Mao's China has been there for seven-teen.\nOn the whole it was very refreshing to hear the other point of\nview on China and certainly one\nemerged greatly enlightened by\nMr. Bruggers' instructive efforts.\nRakesh Mohan\nBLOOD DONOR?\nTo say \"Don't worry, there's nothing to it\", while true is not\nmuch comfort as you will worry\nabout it. I know, I became a donor last year. The 'nerves' were\nby far tire worst part.\nThe things to remember are:\u2014\nto arrive on time, to do exactly as\nyou are told. They begin with\nroutine questions, etc. and ask if\nyou have had certain illnesses.\nThe next thing is a simple\nblood test to see if anything is obviously wrong, for instance ana-emi a. A more detailed test will\nbe carried out later. You then go\nand lie down and the doctor\nneatly slips a needle into your\narm. In my case it was in before\nI knew what was happening.\nAfterwards, you have a lie\ndown followed by\" tea and biscuits.\nThen you leave and carry on as\nusual, I know of noone who suffers any effects for any more\nthan an hour afterwards.\n\"We few, we happy few...\" mused David Marquanrl, opening his\nspeech at the first IC Political Societies leach-in of the term, \"After\nthe Freeze\". He might well have\nin q ant the audience, Which, to\ngive it the btn el t of the doubt,\nnumbered fifty. In fact he was\nreferring to himself, as the only\nLabour speaker on a particularly\nLabour issue. Fortunately the size\nof the audience did not match the\nskill of the speakers. These were\nfive, they were all good, and all\n\u2014including Marquand\u2014were\nquick to dissociate themselves at\nleast in part from the Government's present policy.\nPeter Besell, Liberal M.P. of\nBodmin opened the' meeting with\na lightening Liberal speech. He\nconsidered the present situation\nand future possibilities, and decided the whole policy was a mis-take. What was needed was a highly competitive economy, with\nhigh wages, a new workers'\ncharter, and a breaking down of\nthe worker-manager barrier. It\nwas a scheme in the grand man-ner, and he claimed that Roosevelt had modelled the American\neconomy on this Liberal blueprint.\nIt is surprising Britain did not follow suit.\nFor the Tories, Sir Keith Joseph\nalso castigated the Government.\nThe level of demand must be\nkept in line with productivity; this\nwas not being achieved by the\npresent crash measures. A vigorous eco no mv was the thing, and\na constant flow of manpower from\none job to another, \"an army of\ntemporarily une mpV ved\", was\nneeded to lubricate this economy.\nHOLED WATER SPORTS seem to\nhave become progressively\nmore- dangerous of late, and\nI.C. are determined to keep in\nthe picture. The Boat Club are\ntrying hard and one Saturday,\nnot too long .ago, came the\nfirst hint of success. In an attempt by a novice eight, plus\nFor this high-handed attitude he\nwas roundly attacked by Arthur\nSier, the trade unionist of the\ngroup. \"I 've been unemployed\"\nhe said, \"I know what it's like\".\nHis was the most successful speech\nof the evening ,in that he man ay ed to ridicule everybody except\nthe British worker. The Army the\nfreeze, the stop-go policy, Wilson,\nCallaghan, iS bl wy n Lloyd\u2014a JJ) came under the chopper. Even the\nquestioner who asked about over-manning, under production and\nrestrictive practices was held up\nas \"right-wing, Tory, and naive,\nknowing nothing of the real\nworld\".\nAfter such a biased speech it\nwas a relief to venture into abstruse economics with Dr. Bracewell-Milnes, representing the\nConfederation of British Industry.\nAlthough he supported the\nGovernment his support was only\nhalf-hearted; this was clear even\nto the layman. ',If Columbus had\nspoken to you,\" commented\nMarquand, \"he would never have\ndreamt of crossing the Atlantic.\"\nMarquand advocated a moderate\nthaw, a definite legal minimum\nfor wages, and a sensible workers'\ncharter. He stayed to face a barrage of questions, and after this,\nthe meeting, which had been\nchaired by Pete Ruhemann, clos-ed. .\nWhy was the meeting so poorly\nattended ? Andrew Jordan, Soc.\nSoc. President, blames our old\nfriend, student political apathy,\nand thinks that for this reason\nfuture PolSoc teach-ins may have\nto be shelved. In the meantime\ntwo meetings are planned for the\nterm, one on Rhodesia, and one\nto include Barbara Castle.\nIN EIGHT Untried cox, to overtake, a nasty incident occured. The\nboa it was ho fed and also ran\naground,\u2014fortunately loss the\nwater was too shallow for the\nboat to sink.\nIf anyone saw the ine'dent,\nor can give any further inform-ation, please contact\nProject KRAKEN, shown below, could see Britain's entry into\nthe field of underwater living experiments. The project, conceived by the sub-aqua] club, is described on the late news sheet.\nPublished by C.G.

    "content": "FELIX\nCrosland's defence\nAttacks about fees Mr. Anthony Crosland, feeling singularly and inexplicably\npleased with himself, devoted all of ten minutes to the defence\nof his plans for the fees of overseas students and the future of\ndie Universities. The Secretary of State for Education was addressing a recent meeting at IC and spent rather more time\nanswering questions.\nHis defence of the proposed fees increase was based on the\nargument that student fees at present account for less than 8%\nof the running costs of Universities. The subsidy in fees for\nio reign students would merely be reduced to the level it was at\nfive years ago and would thus help to save some of the \u00a3L8 milion Britain spent in sub sidi sing overseas students last year. He\nhad decided against increasing fees for British students because\nin nearly all cases it would merely involve a transfer of the\nfinancial burden from Central to Local Education Authorities, a burden which the Local Authorities would find it difficult to bear.\nHe did note that for these foreign students financed by the\nMinistry of Overseas Development and the British Council, there\nwould be an increase in grant sufficient to cover the increase in\nfees.\nIn the questions on this subject,\nMr. Crosland had to face sharp attacks from several students arguing\nthat he would be denying many\nstudents, especially those from\nAfrica, perhaps their only chance\nof higher education, and would be\ndepriving the underdeveloped\ncountries of the technical skills\nthey needed to catch up with the\nrest of the world. In defence of\nhis decision, he quoted Britain's economic position and the fact\nthat there would still be a very\nsubstantial subsidy . for foreign\nstudents. In answer to charges that\nsome students living on tight\nbudgets, would have to break off\ntheir studies in the middle of their\ncourses and return home with\nnothing to show for a year or more\nin Britain, the Minister put forward a weak theory that this\nwould not generally be the case\nsince there would not be a full\nincrease for students already studying in this country.\nC.E.M. gets the bird\nLast Tuesday saw the successful\ncompletion of Operation Snatch.\nReaders may remember the skilful\nremoval of C.E.M.' s mascot from\ntheir Union Bar by two intrepid\nGuildsmen at high noon on their\nlast day of term, causing it to be\nabsent from their President's Ball\nthat evening, a photograph being\nsubstituted instead.\nThis term a series of five clues\nwere set leading to the return of\nOswald, their concrete owl, which\nwere followed by C.E.M. with occasionally misdirected enthusiasm.\nThey successfully solved the difficult claes but failed to solve<\nthe two easy clues which were\ntranslated into those everyday\nlanguages\u2014Malayalan and the Periodic Table. The resulting tutorial fees boosted the I.C. Carnival\nFund by the generous sum of \u00a32.\nWe would like to thank the\nMetropolitan Police for their assistance in this venture by chasing a6ft. cavorting owl round\nTrafalgar Square, removing two\nmini-grass skirted gentlemen who\nwere struggling with a4ft. bomb\nin Victoria Station, persuading the\nastonished owner of a Fiat 500 to\nremove an 8ft. concr eSn Christmas cracker from the gates of\nBuckingham Palace and refusing to\nallow a bowler-hatted py jama clad\nC.E.M. student to spend the night\nat the foot of Eroc.\nC.E.M.' s final ignominy came\nwhen they returned, still dressed\nas owls, from' Trafalgar Square to\nfind Oswald, heavily disguised in\nI.C. colours, waiting for them at\nthe bar with Guildsmen outnumbering Cemians three to one in their\nrefectory.\nOwls, eagles, tapirs\u2014what next?\nMike Wimsey, Steve Usher\nThe second hall at his short talk\ndealt with the further expansion of\nuniversities.

    "content": "FELIX\nThe unlikely association of the Anglican Bishop of Montreal,\nand a wild and rustic Presbyterian Scots fur trader led to the idea\nin the nineteenth century of a University for Canada. The trader\nwas prevailed np on by the Bishop to found a universit v. On what\nwere then the outskirts of Montreal grew first a Medical Schoolto be fo'Iowed b v the School of Arts and Science\u2014a centre of\nEnglish learning in the heart of French speaking, but English\ndominated, Quebec.\nFrom these questionable begin-ning s, McGill has come to be\nknown as the 'Harvard of\nCanada': a noble university to\nwhich flock the sons and daughters\nof well-off Quebec 'Anglais', respectable people from the United\nKingdom who find it less em baras sing to go to McGill after failing\nthe Oxbridge entrance exams than\nto a Redbrick, and a great number\nof Americans seeking the education\nof a private university at cut-rate\nprices.\nc Gill by\nFRED\nGAULT\nEnglish Outpost in a French Province What is McGill like? There are\ntwelve thousand students crawling\nabout the tree^lined campus in\nwhat is now the centre of Montreal. They can take degrees in any\nsubject imaginable and do graduate work in most. A large percentage of the undergraduates are\ncommuters who appear at 9 a.m. and can be seen fleeing the campus\nin great numbers )'>r> he suburbs\nat 5 p.m. FEES and\nGOVERNMENT\nThe fees paid by undergraduates\nand graduates alike are \u00a3210 which\ncovers about 30% of the total cost\nof the education given. Thanks,\nhowever, to the magnanimous\ngovernment of Quebec, in collaboration with the University, all students\u2014Canadian, British and American\u2014pay the same amount.\nSome years ago, the Liberal\nGovernment of Jean Lesage swept\nto power in the province on a promise of, among other things, free\neducation. Unfortunately this\nUtopian idea has yet to come to\npass. In fact in 1965 the fees were\nin er eased by \u00a330.\nThe Canadian student in gene r al, and the McGill student in\nparticular, is much more of a political animal than we are here.\nThis was in evidence when the\nfees were raised by the University\n\u2014five thousand students attended\na protest rally led by the student\ngovernment. A provincial Cabinet\nmember spoke to the angry\ngathering and a massive 'sit-in'\ntook place, before a meeting of\nthe University Governors. The\nfees went up !\nMcGill's position in Quebec is\na difficult one. It is the major\nEnglish speaking University in the\nprovince arid is generally believed\nto be well endowed. Thus the\nprovincial government is more inclined to aid the three French\nspeaking universities than McGill\u2014\na situation which gives McGill a feeling of financial neurosis. Though\nit does have a large endowment,\nmost of this is frozen by the original donors. Hence while there may\nbe a surfeit of scholarships available to the third illegitimate sons'\nof immigrant white clergymen,\nthere is more than likely a lack of\nmoney available to support scientists. This conflict j \u2014seen by some as\nan attempt b v the English minority to bleed money from the i French taxpayer for the running of\nThe Founders Tomb in front of the Arts Building\nan English University\u2014may result\nin McGill's decline. It is too early,\nhowever, to make any accurate\npredictions.\nSTUDENT\nGOVERNMENT\nThe students are an active\nspirited lot, and student Conservative, Liberal, Communist and New\nDemocratic parties flourish. The\nstudent government, though not\naligned to any party, is a highly political organization, concerned more with the issues that\naffect students than with the running of clubs and dances.\nThe McGill government belongs\nto the Canadian Union of Students\n(C.U.S.) which is the voice on a national scale of the 140,000 students distributed from coast to\ncoast. Recently the Ganadian\nstudent union shattered when the\nFrench universities from Quebec\nleft C.U.S. to form the Union\nGenerate des Etudiahts de Quebec\n\u2014UGEQ. As education is strictly\na provincial matter in Canada it\nwas felt that a provincially\norientated Union could do more\nfor its members than a national\nbody.\nFor the better part of a year,\nMcGill was a member of both\nUGEQ and CUS until right-wing\nfactions, centered on the Law and\nMedical faculties and headed by a former president, forced a refer-end um. The result of the vote,\nwhich had to be held twice amid\nmuch bitterness, led to McGill's withdrawal from UGEQ. This, most\nprobably, set Franco-English relations back to the days of Wolfe and\nMontcalm.\nThe withdrawal from UGEQ by\npopular vote showed the McGill\nstudent to be a conservative beast\nnot prepared to accept the idea\nof Student;, Syndicalism. The syndicalist believes that he is a young\nintellectual worker\u2014that his\nnatural alignment is with the\nlabour unions1 and farm move-ment s. This was too much for the\nMcGill student to swallow.\nMcGill would rather remain\nthe last fortress of English\nen light ment in a Fiench province,\ncut-off from the people of\nthe province whose taxes pay\nfor 70% of the McGillian'se ducat ion.\nLADS ACTORS\nand BEATS\nWith all of this political activity,\nit is quite natural that most McGill\nstudents are driven to drink and\nin Montreal, the second largest\nFrench speaking city in the world,\na drink is not hard to find. The\ncampus is just north of the city\ncentre and as there are no bars on\nthe campus students are forced to\nmigrate.\nThere are three major bars\nfrequented by three very different\ngroups. The Mansfield Tavern sells\ncheap draught beer and is the\nhangout of the fraternity type,\npeople between classes, and any-\n"

Keele Union felt that it\ncould no longer stay in a National Union whose Executive did not\nrepresent its members.\nThrough the Multiple Transferable Vote procedure which enables the Executive of N.U.S. to\noperate a 'ticket system' at elect-ions, they are able to use the Union\nmachinery they control, to elect\nthen-successors, and thus it is\nimpossible to change the make-up\nof the Executive at elections.\nKeele have sought for several\nyears to change to the Single\nTransferable Vote but have been\nunable to achieve the two-thirds\nmajority which is needed to\nchange the N.U.S. Constitution, although a majority of the Unions\nsupport the change.\nJohn Harris, the President of\nKeele Union, says \"We do not\nwant to set up a rival organisation to the N.U.S., or to cause total\nbreak-up of the National Union;\nrather we wish to see it reformed\nso that we can be members of a National Union in which we\nhave some real faith\".\nMr. Ian Wrigglesworth, a VicePresident of N.U.S., said during a visit to I.C. that N.U.S. would like\nto refund the fees already paid by\nKeele ,for membership but he\nknew nothing definite.\nThe other unip n, which left on\nJanuary * 24th, is that of Salford\nC.A.T,.

The\ncomplaint levelled against the insurgents included the breaking of\nwindows, forcing doors, chains cut,\nand the cutting of the public telephone wires.\nThis report also demands that\nI.C. should not be so hypocritical\nover the timing of the removal of\nMike, as they claim that the Carrot was removed outside Union\nhours in November 1965.\nN.B. W.H.O. files report that Carrot was removed at 9.35 a.m. on\na Saturday morning, when the\nthen Northampton C.A.T. Union\nwas definitely open.\nRCS rials car This year has seen a great expansion in the activities of the\nPt.C.S. Motor Club. From the ij tart it was decided to absorb the\nPedal Car Club, start meetings\nwith films and lectures and start\neither a go-kart section or a trials\ncar section. The latter was decided upon after investigations into\nrelative cost and members' opinions.\nFollowing a talk by Mr. I lamia of\nthe 750 Motor Club it was decided to purchase a cur suitable for\ntrials under 750 Motor Club Rules\nand Regulations. The Chairman\nand Assistant Honorary Secretary\nthen proceeded to search for a suitable vehicle\u2014only to return\nwith a road racing 750 special.\nThis was, however, vaguely suitable for conversion to trials work\n(after many weeks' work!). Last\nSaturday morning saw several of\nour driving members (and our\nPresident\u2014see photo) playing\nStirling Moss on the mud-covered\nsurface of Imperial Institute Road\n\u2014four wheel skids, hand brake turns, the lot. As a result they now\nwant to leave it as it is and enter\nit for Autocross\u2014you just can't win !\nMeanwhile back at Jezebel's garage, removal of the two engine\nblocks had revealed that the unpleasant noise heard on the\nLondon to Brighton Run was due\nto shattered piston rings caused by\nseized gud geon pins. Although proceeding satisfactorily, th fe overhaul will unfortunately not be completed in time for the demolition\nof the existing garage and the\nerection of a larger one.\nFollowing the success of Jezette\nin the Bristol National Pedal Car\nRace last year, when she easily\nwon her class, the same car will\nagain be taken down this year,\nwith improved lighting, brakes etc.\nFor this year's race a system has\nbeen devised in conjunction with\nthe Human Physiology Department\nof University College for optimum\nuse of team capacity. This is controlled by a team of co-or dina tors in the minivan connected to the\npits via a( fata link. Success is\nj ju ar anteed! When the film \"The Jokers\" is\nreleased be sure to see it, Jez\nshould be appearing for a short\ntime\u2014doing her best to run over\nMichael Crawford and Oliver\nReed in a Mini-Moke.\nIt also appears that colour photographs of Jez are now on general\nsale in the form of postcards\u2014price\n5d each.\nR.N.
