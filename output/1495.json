    "content": "TRAVEL\nFELIX\n22\nTravel Editors: Chris Richardson\nDushi Arumuganesan\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 30 september 2011\nTightly nestled among the happy snaps and\nhilarious anecdotes lie the problems you\u2019re\nbound to run into while on the road. For the\nsake of saving your relatives a heart attack it\u2019s\nprobably for the greater good that these are reserved for the likes of memories and private\njournal entries, but I\u2019ll share a great one of\nmine with you. I suppose my only real regret is\nthat my evening after getting my drink spiked\nwas unfortunately nothing like The Hangover.\nSo there I was on the beauty that is Koh Phi\nPhi in Thailand: I was sat with an arm around\nmy girlfriend Hannah (with whom I\u2019d been recently reunited after two months apart) and a\nfrosty beer in my other hand, gazing up a blissful night sky from a sandy white beach thinking life simply couldn\u2019t get any better. Little did\nI know that my blissful illusion was about to\nbe shattered. Thankfully my life philosophy is\n\u2018shit happens\u2019 so I wasn\u2019t too disgruntled.\nHannah is famous for (amongst other things)\nher inability to withstand long nights out, so\npart of the recipe for disaster was her deciding\nto leave me on my lonesome for the evening\nwhile she tucked in early (or ran off with a Thai\nman: who knows?). No big deal, right? I\u2019d been\ntravelling solo for months so was more than acquainted with the tiresome process of befriending total strangers and so on. And this party island was full of people looking for good times,\nso off I set to the nearest beach bar.\nThankfully I had an accomplice by my side\nwho I\u2019d bumped into en-route, so we sat on\nsome bean bags and ordered some shisha with a\ncouple of beers while the DJ cracked out some\ngood old Radiohead: after being flabbergasted\nwith nothing but Akon and the Black Eyed Peas\nthe previous evening this was quite refreshing.\nAlmost as refreshing as the beer in hand, which\nwas my first of the night. Now, I\u2019m no heavy-weight, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so off\nmy face from half a bottle of beer in all my life.\nBy the time I made it to the bathroom I knew\nthat something was rotten in Denmark and proceeded to stuff my bank card into my pants\nSensing that something was up, I haphazardly staggered to the stinky men\u2019s room to examine myself in the mirror. That seemingly simple\ntask was skewed by my seized up legs and the\nexcessive light show commemorating the half\nmoon (any excuse to celebrate, right?). By\nthe time I made it to the bathroom I knew that\nsomething was rotten in Denmark and proceeded to stuff my bank card into my pants (classy),\nleaving but a few tuppence in my dusty wallet\nto detract potential thieves.\nAs the paranoia gripped I decided that the\nmost discreet mode of exit from the bar would\nbe via the Hollywood walkway that was the\nback alley. I suppose the logic in my twisted\nhead was that nobody would follow me and that\nI could get back quickly and get help. I escaped\nonto the main street with some minor injuries\nand a light coating of mystery sludge on my\nshins.\nI\u2019d been on Koh Phi Phi for about five days\nbefore this hilarious incident: I\u2019m not a moron\nWishing You Were Here\nTravel tales wanted!\nCalling all pretentious gap yahs and casual back-packers! Been travelling this summer? Felix Travel\nwants the lowdown on all your adventures. If you\nhave anything \u2013 whether it be a hilarious anecdote\nor helpful destination guide \u2013 send it to us now at\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nwhen it comes to directions and besides, the island has one main street and another branching\nfrom it, where my hostel was located. The fact\nis that I knew my way around with ease, yet in\nthis stupor it was all a blur.\nI started being recklessly illogical with my\nsubsequent decisions on the way home: I was\nsort of in control but compelled to do ridiculous things. At every hotel I passed I demanded\nthat \u201cit\u2019s an emergency!\u201d and that the security\nguards give me all of their pens, which I proceeded to run away with. Cluster of pens in\nhand and staggering like Frankenstein\u2019s beast\nI approached a gang of Thai youths on motorbikes and in true lad fashion demanded \u201clet\u2019s\nhave a go on yer bike son\u201d and was lucky to be\nsent on my merry way by a push of hands rather\nthan a torrent of fists.\nBy this point my stomach had started to disagree with whatever it was that was slowly\ntaking me over and I proceeded to \u2018chunder\neverywah\u2019 in true \u2018gap yah\u2019 fashion. Ironically\nthis was the only time on my trip where I threw\nup, or so I remember. When you\u2019re walking\nthrough a party district leaving a Hansel and\nGretel trail of vomit behind you, you\u2019re hardly\ngreeted with grins. You\u2019ve obviously had one\n(or ten) too many, are making a fool of yourself,\nand are unworthy of any help.\nThrough bile coated teeth I managed to dribble the name of my guesthouse to my new best\nfriend who was apparently a walking Lonely\nPlanet\nI thought that good Samaritans only existed\nin works of fiction but eventually one came to\nmy aid. Through bile coated teeth I managed\nto dribble the name of my guesthouse to my\nnew best friend who was apparently a walking\nLonely Planet \u2013 he knew the location of my\nguesthouse and was eager to get me tucked up\nin bed. I could sense something wasn\u2019t quite\nright as he pulled me closer to darkness and\nout of town, so quickly latched myself onto an\nelderly Thai lady, waving some money in her\nface, just begging to be taken home.\nAfter two hours of wandering the same 50\nmetre stretch of road, sicky and sobbing, it\nturns out I\u2019d been approximately outside of my\nhostel the entire time. She led me the few paces\nto my door and sent me on my merry way, and\nrefused to take my money. Meanwhile, a certain someone in the land of nod was about to be\nwoken by a pleasant surprise.\nAny movement or attempted sipping of water\ninduced nausea, and my knight (nurse) in shining armour (nightie) ensured that I didn\u2019t die\novernight. Eventually I made it to the bed and\nslept solidly for a good few hours and when I\neventually awoke I was severely disorientated\nand achy. For the few days that followed I\nstruggled to navigate the streets that were so\nobvious the previous day, and often had problems keeping up with conversation \u2013 my short\nterm memory had been totally shot.\nKoh Phi Phi is still one of my favourite Thai\nislands and this didn\u2019t detract from the fun\ntimes at all. I\u2019d heard tales of people having\neverything robbed, being held at gunpoint and\nbeing spiked by evidently much worse chemicals like petrol (which stopped a girl from taking her flight home), so by comparison I felt\nlike I\u2019d got off quite lightly \u2013 considering the\ncircumstances I could have came out of that\nsituation much worse off.\nGod knows what was in the drink, or who\nwas responsible, or what would have happened had I consumed the entire thing. I guess I\nshould have taken the \u2018watch all of your drinks\nbeing opened\u2019advice I\u2019d had rammed down my\nthroat, but you live and learn. Quite an interesting experience while it was happening and\nperhaps a tad funny in retrospect. At least my\nbank card and anal virginity were kept intact.\n\u201cI was sort of in control\nbut compelled to do\nridiculous things\u201d\nChris Richardson\nA retrospective look at an eventful drink spiking episode\nTrippy travelling: a reprise\nWhat\u2019s in it for you?\nThis year the Felix Travel team are going to work\nwith writers to get you more freebies on the road:\ngain some writing experience over the year and\nwe\u2019ll show you how to go about approaching companies with writing proposals that\u2019ll heighten your\nbackpacking experience.

Miss Gable, due\nto start Biology lectures this week, has been\ndescribed by her peers in native Manchester\nas \u201ca bit rough\u201d and \u201ca land whale\u201d, with one\nshocked acquaintance confessing she thought\nshe was a man, while she loaded a harpoon\nduring the interview.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever saw her use the girls\u2019\ntoilet. She probably just relieves herself on the\ngo, which would account for the smell. Don\u2019t\ntell her I said that, though. She punches like\nMike Tyson.\u201d\nHowever, the males of Pembridge have already seen past her numerous flaws, with the\nguy in the opposite room rumoured to have\nalready made a move on this piece of hot prop-erty. It would appear that her daily beauty regimen has finally paid off: every morning Gable\nfirst scrubs her body with a Brillo pad infused\nwith carbolic soap, which aids in cleansing the\nbuild-up of dirt between folds; this makes the\ntwice-weekly full-body wax easier. This is followed up by a daily dose of acyclovir to keep\nher herpes in check, which may otherwise\nprove to be a deal-breaker among the young\nmen of Imperial.\n\u201cI also make sure I shave my eyebrows every\nfortnight because I\u2019ve been told that really accentuates my eyes, which are my best feature\nto be honest.\u201d\nFurther investigation revealed that the source\nof this solitary compliment to be Gable\u2019s best\nfriend, who panicked when she couldn\u2019t think\nof anything else to comfort her with after being\nrejected by the year\u2019s ugliest guy again. This\nresulted in Gable replacing her Facebook profile picture of a smiley-face drawing with that\nof a close-up of her iris.\nGuy who forces everyone to play long drawn\nout drinking games\nDrinking games are fine, but not every single\ntime you go out. Subscribes to the International drinking rules (using weaker hand to\nhold drink, etc \u2013 presumably to keep the other\nhand free for wanking). Hey, fuckface, here\u2019s\na drinking game for you, it\u2019s called taking sips\nof you drink while talking and then getting\nanother one when finished. It\u2019s revolutionary;\nyou should try it some time.\nGuy who has a girlfriend\nUses the fact he has a girlfriend to prove he\nisn\u2019t a nerd, nice try. Probably to be found in\nthe corner on the phone, gently weeping, say-ing: \u2018haha, answer phone again. I guess you\nforgot to charge your phone again. By the way\nthe pictures of you and that guy are hilarious.\nIt really looks as if you are getting with each\nother, brilliant\u2019.\nGirl who thinks she is fit\nCaked in make-up and growing ever more\nfrustrated that, in a male dominated university,\nshe still isn\u2019t getting the amount of attention\nshe wants/thinks she warrants. She even specially bought denim shorts so short they could\npass for y-fronts. It appears you can Photoshop\nand crop a carefully chosen profile picture,\nbut you can\u2019t Photoshop real life. All the guys\nare half squinting at her thinking \u2018I swear that\nlooks like that hot one I saw post something,\nbut less fit.\u2019 I give it roughly two months before desperation sets in and the guys drop their\nstandards. And here starts the Imperial and\nnormal rating system.\nGirl who is actually fit\n\u2018Meet\u2019 is a strong term. You will know her\npresence, mainly because she is the eye of a\nstorm of guys encircling her. Rarer than finding a good N-Dubz song.\nGuy who was popular in school\nHe thinks that means something here. Probably\nsays things like: \u2018Yeah I mean it doesn\u2019t really\nmatter how many Facebook friends you have,\nI don\u2019t count\u2019. The end of that sentence would\nbe: \u2018every week, I count every day\u2019. When\ntalking he will be on his Blackberry BBMing\npeople. Assumes University is like school, and\nthat he will be the cool kid.\nGuy who wasn\u2019t popular in school\nOr to put it in other terms, most of the people at Imperial. Hoping to make a fresh start\nand jump right to the top of the social ladder.\nFriend count that applies to the Guy who was\npopular in school also applies here.\nGuy who has already identified all the attractive girls in the Facebook groups\nCarefully combing through the Freshers\u2019\ngroups, he has his targets already identified.\nA bullet point list of their likes and possible\ndislikes in his head. Ready to pounce, thwarted\nonly by the people who don\u2019t advertise their\nlives online. A true pro will have also found\ntheir Twitter. You have, haven\u2019t you?\nPeople that you will meet in Freshers\u2019Week\nThe eyes are the windows to the soul.\nIt\u2019s a shame that the surrounding\nhouse is a dump. Note: picture contains visual metaphor.\nDRUNKEN MATE OF THE\nWEEK\nHANGMAN\nWhen asked James Murdoch said he\nhad no direct knowledge of who he\nmet during Freshers\u2019 Week.\nBalls of steel? Could you\nbe the next Hangman?\nThink you\u2019re some satirical ge-nius? Hey, guess what? You\u2019re\nnot!\nProne with crippling self-doubt\nin your own comedic poten-tial? That\u2019s more like it.\nHangman needs some willing\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s to massage our ego\nand perhaps even write stuff\nthat you find funny but no-one\nelse does. They\u2019ll appreciate it\nonce you\u2019re behind bars.\nIf you think you\u2019re hard\nenough, start up News of the\nWorld again and hack the\nMurdochs, then get in touch\nwith hangman.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\n\u201cOh man, check out that nectar-y goodness. I\u2019ll just\nhave the one, mind. I\u2019ve got lectures starting at\n9am tomorrow.\u201d\nDRUNK PICTURES PLS, always ask for their permission before sending them in.\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\n17\nfelix FRIDAY 30 september 2011\nMake a meal of it\nS\no, I\u2019m sitting in the Union,\nand the Felix editor comes\nup and says, \u201cHi, would\nyou like to go and review\nGiraffe?\u201d And I say yes, especially as the restaurant is paying. But\nnow, all I can think is \u201cOh shit\u201d. You\nsee, I\u2019m stuck. I just don\u2019t know how\nto write a proper food review \u2013 I mean,\nwhere do I get the training for this sort\nof thing? I\u2019ve never played this game\nbefore. Sure, I\u2019ve always rather loved\nnosh. Yes, I can tell the difference between fried and poached eggs, vomit\nand ratatouille. I\u2019ve even eaten in a few\nMichelin-starred restaurants. But when\nit comes to expressing my taste sensations in writing, I\u2019m lost.\nAround Imperial, between South\nKensington and Hyde Park, there is a\ncluster of decent restaurants. How do\nI use words to differentiate between\nthem? Am I supposed to use those bizarre clich\u00e9s that seem to engulf the\nrestaurant blurbs in the Sunday papers?\nWhere everything is \u201cby turns ingenious\nand divine\u201d and \u201cas rich as it is light\u201d.\nOr should I do a Michael Winner? Do\nI need to be snooty and sniffy, should\nI embrace my inner cynic? Should I\ndeclare, whatever the true experience,\nthat the restaurant is a waste of time, the\nfood like bombs of filth exploding in the\nmouth? Do I snidely ridicule the cheery\nambiance, unnecessarily belittling it\nwith pompous irony? It just seems so\nunfair to patronise a place for what it is.\nHow can I write a eulogy to a steak?\nIt requires nothing except buying, and\na brief introduction to heat. Perhaps I\nneed to find some of that French je ne\nsais quoi. A bit of wit, bonhomie, and\nbanter. A succulent vocabulary, where\nI can harp on in lyrical prose about the\ndeep egginess of the fat, the delightful\nwhiff of griddle lines. I need to hit the\nsatirical button. Those blokes off MasterChef have it easy. All they have to do\nis eat a few chunks of grub, look pen-sive, and mumble a few \u201ceurgh\u2019s\u201d and\n\u201cmmmm\u2019s\u201d. No need for the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary.\nOr do I need to be philosophical? We\nare what we eat, and what we eat makes\nus who we are, and all that gibberish.\nAm I supposed to put the restaurant into\ncontext? Should I chuck in some guff\nabout how London is the perfect place\nfor an eatery aspiring to serve \u201cworld\ncuisine\u201d to the tune of \u201cworld music\u201d?\nAnd how the place provides the perfect retreat from the frantic pace of the\ncapital? Am I supposed to mention the\nprices, or investigate the quality of the\ntoilets?\nI just can\u2019t do it. No, I just can\u2019t.\nAaaaaargh! I just have to forget the stupid tried-and-tested methods, the corny\nmetaphors \u2013 in truth, they tell you nothing about a place. I just need to stick\nto the point. I went to Giraffe with my\ngood friend Eileen. During the meal, we\nhad a brief chat.\n\u201cEileen,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is quite a good\nlittle restaurant.\u201d\nShe replied, \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s that, really. The food is\nperfectly good \u2013 we had Japanese tiger prawns (decent), edamame (over-seasoned), a lamb focaccia burger (very\ngood), and the Chef\u2019s favourite duck stir\nfry (not bad). For pudding, chocolate\nchunk brownie (hearty and sweet) and\nfruit crush sorbets (refreshing blackcurrant and apple flavours). Eileen is from\nNew Orleans, so we were hoping to try\nout the Jambalaya, but unfortunately\nthey had run out. The fruit smoothies\nwere delicious, the atmosphere is re-laxed, and the staff were friendly (I\u2019ve\nbeen reliably informed that all good restaurant critics use the rule of three). You\nget well-made food in a nice room surrounded by nice people. And that\u2019s all\nI want to say on the matter, forget any\nstar-rating nonsense.\nGiraffe 7 Kensington High Street London W8 5NP\n. Students with valid Imperial ID can recieve a 25% discount\non food all day Monday \u2013 Thursday\nand on Sunday after 6pm.\nCharles Betts wrestles with existential angst as\nhe attempts to review restaurant chain Giraffe\nTo be honest, we don\u2019t know our fried\neggs from our filet mignon here at\nFelix Towers. If you feel you\u2019d be up\nfor guiding Imperial\u2019s culinary palate\nover the next academic year as a\nFood Editor, drop us an email at\nfelix.imperial@ac.uk.\nTake a chance on Giraffe, or even... stick your neck out...eh, eh? I\u2019ll get my coat\n\n"

Currys\u201d\nI\n\u2019m young. I\u2019m a student. I\u2019ve\ngrown up with today\u2019s British Culture and I am a part of\n\u2018Today\u2019s Generation\u2019. So why\ndidn\u2019t you see me running\naround London setting fire to furniture\nstores and stealing carpets? Oh that\u2019s\nright, because I\u2019m not a complete and\nutter idiot.\nWhat started out as a protest turned\ninto a catastrophe only two months\nback. Windows were smashed, shops\nwere looted and hoodies were worn. So\nwhy weren\u2019t we (the Imperial student\nbody) a part of this? I mean hey, free\nstuff \u2013 who doesn\u2019t want that?\nFirstly, let\u2019s be honest: every single\none of us did consider it for that tiny\nsecond. You took a lingering look at\nyour old hoody and thought, \u201cA new\nMacbook sounds nice, let\u2019s head down\nto my local Currys and see what I can\ncome back with.\u201d At least we\u2019re sensible enough to realise that perhaps you\nshouldn\u2019t wear your Currys uniform\nwhen you\u2019re about to go and loot\u2026\nCurrys.\nBut after the brief moment of temp-tation, your logic kicks in. We are civilised individuals and well, frankly, we\nhave a bit more than an ounce of self-re-spect for ourselves. We know the difference between right and wrong and the\ndifference between breaking windows\nand breaking the law.\nYou hear people blaming our \u2018sick\u2019society on parents, gang culture and a lack\nof community. To some extent I agree,\nthere were many factors. But they forgot to blame the actual kids themselves.\nI mean, I\u2019m pretty sure an 11 year old\nknows what he\u2019s doing when he walks\ninto a rioting crowd with a hammer.And\nI\u2019m definitely sure a guy knows what\nhe\u2019s doing when he steals something\nfrom the backpack of an injured boy.\nThat\u2019s beyond sick and twisted; you\u2019re\nentering the stages of mental psychoses\nif you\u2019re willing to go that far.\nThe truth is that half our generation,\nthe half we like to make fun of, \u2018the\nchavs\u2019, have lost their moral compass,\ntheir sense of dignity and their minds.\nWhen you hear some of the reasons\nthese people came up with \u2013 like showing the police \u2018we can do what we\nwant\u2019, or \u2018cos the government is crap\ninnit\u2019, or my personal favourite \u2018cos\neveryone else is doing it\u2019 \u2013 it actually\nblows your mind. Are these people for\nreal? (And did no one ever teach them\nof the infamous saying \u2018well if everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do\nit too?\u2019)\nI\u2019m not trying to say that we are superior to the hoodies, but we are living\nproof that we have grown up in this\nday and age as relatively normal human beings. Instead of going out on a\nrampage against the law every night\nwe stayed in and \u2018liked\u2019 funny Facebook pages about it. We signed peti-Intelligence Officers\n\u00a324,750 + benefits UK based\nAnalysing information. Spotting connections. Making decisions that\nreally matter. This is what MI5\u2019s dedicated and focused Intelligence\nOfficers do every day. Working together, we help safeguard the\nsecurity of the nation.\nThis is challenging and vitally important work that demands strong\ncommunication, analytical and organisational skills \u2013 not to\nmention a good deal of patience and attention to detail. If you\nenjoy solving problems, becoming an Intelligence Officer is one of\nthe most rewarding and interesting career paths you could choose.\nMake sense of it at www.mi5.gov.uk/careers/intelligence\nTo apply you must be over\n18 and a British citizen.\nDiscretion is vital. You should\nnot discuss your application,\nother than with your partner\nor a close family member.\ntions to bring in the army, to support\nthe police and to help clean up the\nstreets of London.\nSo when politicians look back on why\nthese riots started, they shouldn\u2019t be so\ngeneralised. We shouldn\u2019t be clumped\nin with the rest of \u2018Today\u2019s Generation\u2019 just because we were raised in the\nsame era. Politicians should focus on\nthe differences between the split within\nour generation. Why do some people\nturn out as \u2018chavs\u2019 and others turn out\nlike us? They should know that when it\ncomes to growing up in this society, at\nleast some of us got it right.\nIt\u2019s not all writing and that. Felix\nneeds keen Illustrators and Photographers to make sure that these\npages have at least some colour\noccasionally.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n6\nIn other news\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 30 september 2011\nPotato genome sequenced\nThis summer, the humble potato became the first\nmajor UK crop plant to have its genome sequenced.\nBefore it had its genetic make-up studied in detail,\nnew varieties of potato took between 10 and 12\nyears to breed. This process should now be sped\nup considerably thanks to an international collaboration of researchers, which included a member\nof the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial: Dr\nGerard Bishop. The all-important details were published in the journal Nature in July.\nIn the UK we each eat, on average, 94kg of potatoes a year. They are becoming more popular across\nthe world, too, especially in Africa and some parts of\nAsia \u2014 upping the role of the potato in global food\nsecurity. By 2050, 9 billion people\nare expected to be living on the\nplanet. Engineering a potato with\ngreater water uptake and disease\nand drought resistance will become increasingly necessary\nas the world population\ngrows and there are more\nand more mouths to feed.\nHaving the potato genome is going to make\ndoing that a whole lot\nmore feasible.\nKelly Oakes\nWhile you\u2019ve been busy travelling the world,\nwaiting for term to start, the staff at Imperial\nhave been pushing the boundaries of human\nknowledge. The keen students amongst you\nmay be aware of what headlines Imperial has\nbeen making over the last few months. But\nfor those of you whose New Scientist subscription was ended abruptly as soon as you\ngot your offer, we\u2019ve got a round up of some\nof the most interesting and important science coming out of the College this summer.\nSmart materials make\nproteins form crystals\nScientists at Imperial teamed up with the\nUniversity of Surrey to develop a new method to enable the formation of crystals from\nproteins using \u2018smart materials\u2019 which are\nable to maintain the shape and characteristics\nof the molecules. The method should boost research into new medicines, assisting scientists\nin working out the structure of drug targets.\nDeveloping new drugs involves identifying the\nstructure of proteins associated with a disease\nand designing molecules that can block their\nfunction. The researchers developed an effective means for crystallizing proteins using Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs), which\nintrinsically bind together around the outside\nof a molecule, leaving it with a strong likeness\nto the original target shape when the molecule\nis extracted.\nPreviously, scientists have obtained useful\ncrystals for fewer than twenty per cent of proteins identified as potential drug targets, the\nnumber of which is increasing exponentially.\nThe ability to remember attributes of molecules make the MIPs ideal nucleants, making\nit easier for protein molecules to bind and form\ncrystals. The research, led by Professor Naomi\nChayen from the Department of Surgery and\nCancer at Imperial, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the European Commission.\nThe researchers found that six different\nMIPs induced crystallisation of nine proteins,\nproviding results in conditions that would\notherwise not cause crystals to form. Professor Chayen commented, \u201c[MIPs can produce]\nbetter crystals than we can with other meth-ods. This is a really significant innovation that\ncould have a major impact on research leading\nto the development of new drugs\u201d.\nMost distant quasar\ndiscovered\nLight from a quasar 13 billion light years away\nreached the UK Infrared Telescope in Hawaii\nlate last year during an infrared deep sky sur-vey. A light year is the distance travelled by\nlight in one Earth year, so we\u2019re seeing the\nquasar as it was 13 billion years ago \u2014 only\n770 million years after the Big Bang. It\u2019s the\nmost distant quasar ever discovered. The finding was announced in a paper in the journal\nNature in June. Lead author on the paper was\nDr Daniel Mortlock from the Physics department at Imperial.\nA quasar, or \u201cquasi-stellar radio source\u201d, is\nthe active nuclei of a distant galaxy. It surrounds the central black hole of the galaxy\nand is powered by a disk of material accret-ed on to the black hole because of its huge\ngravitational pull. The material, mainly gas,\nbecomes very hot and emits a considerable\namount of ultraviolet radiation. As the radiation travels across the universe to us it becomes stretched due to a phenomenon known\nas redshift. This shift in wavelength allows\nastrophysicists to calculate how far the light\nhas travelled.\nThe newly discovered quasar, known by the\ncatchy name ULAS J1120+0641, is 2 billion\ntimes as massive as the Sun and lies in the constellation Leo in the night sky. It is a hundred\ntimes brighter than anything else discovered\naround the same distance away, meaning it\nwill be able to give us a unique insight into the\nuniverse when it was just beginning.\nStatins found to reduce risk\nof death from infections\nUnexpected findings by researchers suggest\nthat statins, medication for reducing cholesterol and lowering the chances of suffering\nheart attacks and strokes, may stop deaths from\ninfections and respiratory illnesses. Professor\nPeter Sever, from Imperial\u2019s International Centre for Circulatory Health, presented the results\nat the annual congress of the European Society\nof Cardiology on 28 August. Professor Sever\nand his research team inspected the death\ncertificates of nearly 1,000 people who were\namong 10,000 volunteers with high blood\npressure testing atorvastatin, a type of statin,\nfor the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes\nTrial (Ascot). They found that eleven years after the trial, deaths from infections and respiratory problems were 36 per cent lower than with\nthose given a placebo. The statins appeared to\nreduce the production of inflammatory agents\nin the blood that are toxic and stimulated by\ninfections.\nProfessor Sever said, \u201cthis study is going to\nmake people think more about the non-car-diovascular benefits of statins\u201d. It is suggested that patients with a high risk of developing\npneumonia could be prescribed the drugs, and\nProfessor Sever added that there now was an\n\u201cemerging evidence base for statins protecting against infections\u201d while warning against\nwidening statin prescriptions based on one\nstudy.\nStudies have shown statins have potential\nside effects such as muscle weakness and liver\nand kidney problems. The death rates from\ncancer within the Ascot study showed no dif-ference. At the same time, Professor Sever\nmentioned he has \u201cno reason to believe ator-vastatin is unique in these non-cardiovascular\nactions\u201d. The drug is taken by up to seven million people in Britain.\nKelly Oakes\nWhile you were away...\nAlex Karapetian\nLord of the Rings 3000 was a controversial move, but ultimately way more bad-ass\nIdentity-shifting neutrinos\nNeutrinos are slippery particles by nature because\nthey do not interact with matter, generally passing through it completely undetected. Now particle\nphysicists might have found another side to their inherent elusiveness: a new way to shift their identity.\nResults from the T2K neutrino experiment in Japan\nshow a new type of \u201coscillation\u201d that would allow\nneutrinos to change type in a way not seen before.\nWhile looking at neutrinos from the Sun in 2001,\nphysicists finally proved suspicions they had held\nsince the 1960s that two types of neutrino oscillation can occur. There are three types, or flavours, of\nneutrino in all. One is paired with the electron and\nknown as the electron neutrino. The other two are\npaired with the muon and tau leptons, fundamental particles that are identical to electrons except\nfor larger masses. Electron neutrinos had been observed changing into muon and tau neutrinos in the\n2001 results. The transition physicists think they\nmay have just seen would complete the set \u2014 it is\nthe only transition that is thought to be possible theoretically but that has not yet been seen in reality.\nBut, it\u2019s not quite that simple. There is still a small\nbut not insignificant probability that the results seen\noccurred, not because of a new oscillation, but simply by chance. This means that, though the results\ndo indicate that this third type of oscillation did\noccur, they do not show an outright discovery. Imperial\u2019s Professor David Wark, who leads the UK\u2019s\ninvolvement with the T2K experiment, said that on\na scale ranging from \u201cmaybe\u201d to \u201cprobably\u201d to \u201calmost certainly\u201d, the new result puts us somewhere\nbetween the latter two. The results were published\nin Physical Review Letters in June.\nKelly Oakes\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlex Karapetian\n\n"

With the\nsector seeing strong growth thanks to some highly\ncompetitive prices, it looks like a good time to invest\nin one of the devices. Amazon\u2019s own Kindle range of\neReaders starts at \u00a3111 and comes with access to\nAmazon\u2019s unrivalled selection of books, magazines\nand newspaper subscriptions. In comparison, Sony\u2019s\nnew offering is similarly priced but it remains to be\nseen how extensive their collection of reading material will be, despite their support of the ubiquitous\nePub format. Where Waterstone\u2019s own brand will\ncompete is an open question as yet, but it\u2019s a bold\nmove from a brick-and-mortar retailer with no prior\nexperience in electronics.\nWhile human augmentation and neural prostheses\nare enjoying a flurry of media coverage post Deus\nEx, out in the real world science is slowly starting to\nmimic science fiction with the addition of piezoelectric generators to a beetle that capture the kinetic\nenergy from its vibrating wings and turns it to useable electricity. Why would a beetle need a power sup-ply, you ask? Only to power the neural implants that\nallow researchers to direct it\u2019s movement, of course.\nThe beetle, which could also be extended to use\nthermal and solar generators, might play a useful\nrole in lending camera access to dangerous areas\nwhere human investigation is impossible. The technology marks the rapid strides that scientists have\nmade in interfacing the brains of simple insects with\nmicrochips; while we are a long way from realising\nanything similar in humans, the possibilities of such\nbioengineering can\u2019t be overstated.\nCyborg beetle goes green\nW\nelcome to Imperial!\nYou\u2019ve done well to make\nit here; for the next few\nyears you will get to experience extreme levels of\nstress, a rapidly receding hairline and the effects of excess Red Bull consumption (seizure,\nin the case of one of my housemates).\nDespite this, there\u2019s much to be said for\nstudying at one of the world\u2019s leading universities in one of the world\u2019s most interesting cit-ies; if you\u2019re interested in something, you\u2019re\ngoing to be able to pursue it to your heart\u2019s\ncontent.\nThat brings me to what we do here at Felix\nTechnology. Our section involves covering a\nwide spectrum of topics, from artificial intelligence and robotics to the latest tablets and the\nfierce industry competition that drives them to\nmarket. Do get in touch with us if you\u2019d like\nto try your hand at contributing (our email address is right at the top of this page). It really is\njust easy as a single email.\nThis week however, we\u2019re getting you set\nup here in London: whether you\u2019re new to\nthe UK or live an hour away by train, living\nat university means you\u2019ve had to leave your\nmassive CD collection behind and replace that\n40\u201d TV with a 15\u201d laptop streaming American\nTV from dodgy Chinese websites; university\ndoesn\u2019t get better than this. Thankfully, we\u2019re\nhere to make the experience slightly more\nbearable.\nMedia\nYour internet is provided by one of the fastest\nproviders in the country, so the sky\u2019s the limit\nwhen it comes to streaming quality HD content straight to your laptop. For your terrestrial\ntelevision needs, BBC iPlayer (http://www.\nbbc.co.uk/iplayer/) and Channel 4\u2019s 4oD\n(http://www.channel4.com/programmes/4od)\nare going to be your new best friends. For\nAmerican television shows however, you\u2019re\ngoing to have to make wise use of Sidereel\n(http://www.sidereel.com/). Be smart about\nwhere you get your media from however: the\nCollege actually enforces its piracy policy.\nIf you\u2019re more worried about your music,\nthen you\u2019ll be pleased to know the situation is\nmuch better. On one hand you have Grooveshark (http://grooveshark.com/), a huge music\nlibrary that\u2019s free to access if you don\u2019t mind\nrelatively mediocre sound quality, while on the\nother you have Spotify (http://www.spotify.\ncom/). Despite Spotify\u2019s free services being\nlimited, the huge collection of music it offers\nyou for five pounds a month is well worth it.\nGetting Work Done\nThere will undoubtedly be times when you\nneed to get a file from halls to uni, whether\nit be coursework or the ticket for that all-im-portant night out. Sure you could take a flash\ndrive, but you might forget it. And emailing\nstuff to yourself is so last decade. Cloud storage is the ideal for this, giving you access to\nyour files wherever, whenever.\nDropbox (http://db.tt/4FhV4rO) is a great\nonline storage service, with apps for all major\nplatforms and smartphones, and web access\nin case you can\u2019t get to either. With 2GB of\nstorage from the off (2.25GB if you follow the\nlink!) and its simple and easy interface, Dropbox is highly recommended.\nAnother good service to use is Google Docs\n(http://docs.google.com). The main feature of\nDocs is that you can create documents, spreadsheets and presentations for free, entirely in\nthe cloud. That alone makes it great for working from multiple locations, and its collaborative editing works well too. But on top of that,\nyou also get free file storage. You can store as\nmany Google Documents as you want, and\nyou also get 1GB of storage to keep whatever\nyou want on their servers.\nApps\nYou may also want to invest in a remote-locking app. In case you lose your phone or it\ngets stolen, these apps at least give you some\npeace of mind as you know whoever has the\nphone won\u2019t be able to get at your stuff. Just\nmake sure you can unlock it in case it turns up!\nA quick search finds Anti-Theft for Mobile\n(http://bit.ly/obwngF) for Android, Windows\nPhone 7 and Symbian, while iOS and BlackBerry OS both come with their own services\n(Find My iPhone and BlackBerry Protect,\nrespectively).\nOnline\nThere are also some great online services to\nhelp you get things done easily. Transport for\nLondon should be your first port of call when\nlooking up anything public transport related\nacross the capital. The Journey Planner is ex-cellent. It may not have the best interface for\nadvanced searches, but it will do pretty much\neverything you want it to. You can also look\nup which buses have either 24-hour service or\nnight routes (essential for nights out), or even\nfirst tubes home (for those really late ones...).\nAnother tremendously useful service is Skype (http://www.skype.com/). Its main selling\npoint is that you can make both voice and video calls to other Skype users for free. So if you\ncan get your friends to sign up, there\u2019s a lot of\nmoney to be saved. That\u2019s not all though, as\nSkype actually offer very good rates for calling\nlandlines and mobiles all over the world, so it\u2019s\nworth a look for phoning home too.\nAt Imperial\nAlso worth a mention are the excellent services\nhereatImperialtomakeyourlifeeasier.TheICT\noffice (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ict) in the\nSherfield building offers free, professional help\nwith getting your computer set up in addition to\ntroubleshooting for any problems you may have.\nThecollegehasabunchofTwitteraccounts,with\n@imperialcollege and @imperiallibrary\nproviding useful information on events across\ncampus. The Imperial File Exchange service\n(https://fileexchange.imperial.ac.uk/) is very\nuseful for transferring large files, saving your\nemail from doing the heavy lifting. Finally,\nwe\u2019re not above some cheeky self-promotion\nhere at Felix, with both the @feliximperial and\n@felixtechnology accounts well worth a follow\nwhile you\u2019re at it.\nFinally, have a great Freshers\u2019 week and an\neven better year ahead!\nThe Felix Tech Guide 2011\nFeroz Salam and Chris Bowers get you up to scratch\n\n"

And so\nthey trotted off on a Mediterranean jolly with plenty of high hopes for some\nof that elusive minge. As they put it,\n\u201cit\u2019ll be like shooting clunge in a barrel\u201d. The Inbetweeners Movie is, as the\nname suggests, the movie version of\nthe much loved TV sitcom series.\nThe film follows the bog standard\nship-the-tv-series-guys-on-a-long-hol-iday-in-a-foreign-country format with\nplenty of boobs, vomit, and embarrassing situations. It\u2019s a simple, lazy\nformat. You know what you\u2019re getting beforehand. But sometimes that\u2019s\nenough. You know what you want,\nand you get what you want. The crude,\ncrass jokes are aimed at our lowest,\nmost basic level of humour and are\nvery fond of willies, poo, and hard-ons.\nMuch has been made of the film\u2019s\nsimilarities and differences to Harry\nEnfield\u2019s Kevin & Perry Go Large,\nwhich at the time of its release was badly received by the critics.

A lot has\nchanged ever since we first went to print\nall the way back in 1949: we\u2019re a little\nbigger than an A4 pamphlet and you\ndon\u2019t have to pay \u2018threepence\u2019, let alone\nanything, for a copy.\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed, however, is our\ncommitment to entertain and inform\nyou about the latest student news and\ngoings-on about your new university.\nFrom the highs to the lows, we will be\nthere throughout the year, examining\nthe issues that matter to you. The rumour goes that we were named after a\nparticularly popular student, but we\u2019ve\ngrown into something that truly aims to\nrepresent all students.\nThe newspaper is entirely created by\nstudents, and we\u2019d love you to join us.\nCome and visit us at Freshers\u2019 Fair this\nTuesday.

To returning second years and\nabove, welcome back. We can reminisce about our summers in the Union\nBar later but first let\u2019s offer a warm invitation of friendship to those whom this\nis their first Felix. Just look at them, so\nbright-eyed and fresh-faced!\nLike chipmunks with graphical\ncalculators.\nI find it hard to believe this is the start\nof my fourth year here at Imperial. It\nseems like only yesterday I dressed in an\nill-fitting suit, marvelling at the Queen\u2019s\nTower as I waited for my admissions in-terview. But that was such a long time\nago. Age and time are creeping up on\nme with cudgels in their hands.\nI do feel like I\u2019ve been mugged, or at\nleast short-changed. I left school four\nyears ago and I\u2019m now halfway through\nmy degree after three years of sleep,\ntequila and supposedly some study,\nas well as a gap year (an unavoidable\nmachination of curious fate). All that\ntime, those memories and experiences,\nfeels as if it\u2019s passed with a snap of\nthe fingers. Four years for the price of\nseconds.\nBut when I think of all I\u2019ve seen and\ndone and accomplished in that time,\nmaybe I haven\u2019t been cheated. I\u2019ve\nmade friends (more than I\u2019ve lost) and\nI\u2019ve learned things (more than I\u2019ve for-gotten). If I had really made that kind\nof progress in mere seconds, it would\nbe nothing short of miraculous. Tempus\nfugit, truly*.\nIf my time is filled with the kind of\nadventures that I\u2019ve had and hope to\nhave more of, I don\u2019t mind if they seem\nto pass with the speed and cunning of a\nleopard with a grudge. My real problem\nis when I stop and think how fast time\nhas flown. It makes me feel old. That\nmakes me feel uncomfortable \u2013 I feel\nI should start being sensible and buy a\nFord Mondeo. Being sensible is worse\nthan being dead.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that all around me\nmy friends are growing up. Most have\ngraduated now \u2013 those that went to\nuniversity. One friend is a teacher now\nwhen just a short while ago she was but\na student. Another one of my friends has\ncome to London to practice law. He also\nhas a beard, another hallmark of matu-rity. Meanwhile, here I am, cocooning\nmyself in academia as a bubble against\nthe outside world. Each new wave of\nfreshers is the universe\u2019s way to dragging me from my shell and shoving my\nface in grim reality. But my cocoon can\ntake a few more waves yet.\nFreshers make me feel old as well but\nI handle them. They add new breath to\nThe clock is ticking\nImperial, infuse it with a fresh joie de\nvivre. Freshers are the antidote to living\nsensibly. So then, welcome Freshers,\nwelcome! I hope you enjoy your time\nhere and that you thoroughly make the\nmost of it. Imperial has given you three\nyears of carte blanche. Join a club, learn\nto unicycle, punch a bear in the face.\nYou may be here for years but don\u2019t\nsquander them.\nThey may be the best the seconds of\nyour life.\n* Tempus fugit is actually the species\nname of the Time Fly. It flies around in\ncircles of Thursday mornings and feeds\non the seeds of what will be rotten fruit.\nIt is usually eaten by the Carp Diem.\nIt turns out that time waits for no man, or Fresher\nRhys Davies\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nOn and on it ticks, exams are only about 8 months away \u2013 just sayin\u2019\n\u201d\nAll that time, those memories\nand experiences, feels as if\nit\u2019s passed with a snap of the\nfingers\n\u201cJoin a club, learn\nto unicycle, punch a\nbear in the face\u201d\nAlthough you attend a university blessed\nwith a truly culturally diverse student body,\nyou are, in one way, less diverse than you\nmay care to believe. Home and international students alike, you are all united by the\nchanging face of education.\nThis time last year we could merely attempt to predict the findings \u2013 and the\nconsequences \u2013 of the Browne Review,\nthe much publicised study into the future\nof British higher education. The following\nthreefold increase on the cost of a degree\nfor next year\u2019s UK student intake, a development that was not wholly unexpected.\nThe real surprise was heralded by the turn\nof November, as the country was gripped\nby a wave of protests held, for the most\npart, by students taking a stand against\nthe proposed rise in fees. This altogether\nwas an unprecedented activity, even from\na community with a long history of political\ninterest and activism. At its best, it was a\nreminder to those in authority to stay true\nto their pledges.\nAll of you are now on the cusp of drastic\nchanges in the world of education. For international students, unaffected by the UK\u2019s\nchanges to fees, the issue of reducing student visas is likely to resurface soon. There\nis no better time than this moment to take\na pause for thought before you all take the\nsignificant leap into university life. Consider\nthe changes still to come for those still to\nembark on their path through higher educa-tion, and duly make the most of your time\nhere.\nImperial is assuredly seeking to ensure\nthat all future education is most certainly\nworth the money, with but a couple of examples including the implementation of a\nnew, deservedly praised bursary scheme\nin reaction to increased fees, alongside a\nkeen interest in improving assessment and\nfeedback \u2013 a source of particular dissatisfaction amongst many students here.\nThe most significant factor in determining your own satisfaction here at Imperial\nrests with your individual actions. You applied to a top university; you should expect\nan excellent education in return. If you are\ndissatisfied with any aspect of your course,\ntalk to classmates or discuss concerns with\nyour representatives. You shape your own\npersonal university experience, and leave a\nlegacy for years to come.\nFelix, in its capacity as a newspaper serving you, the student, will continue to inform\nand entertain you throughout the year as\nthis situation inevitably develops. Take an\ninterest in the stories that surface both\nhere and elsewhere, if not for yourselves,\nthen for those following you into a very\nchanged world next year.\nFELIX\nEducation is changing,\nmake the most of it now\n\n"

The politics team in\nFelix hopes to keep you interested in\nthe politics of the outside world while\nyou spend your year in the bubble of\nuniversity life.\nHowever, since we\u2019re all returning\nfrom the summer holidays the first issue\nis going to give you a short summary\nof what has happened over the summer\nwhile you\u2019ve been vacationing/intern-ing/preparing for university etc. Some\nof these things will be talked about for\nyears to come, stories to tell the grand-children, or the kind of things that you\ncan discuss with people with whom you\nhave nothing in common. Should also\nbe useful for some of those awkward\npost-holiday conversations on the first\nday of term\u2026\nIf you\u2019re looking at this page and\nthinking that writing about the latest\npolitical developments from across\nthe globe is right up your street, then\nyou might just want to be a Politics\nReporter. If you\u2019re interested, get\nin touch with the Politics Editors at\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nWe gear up for another year of politics by rounding up the events of the summer\nJoe Letts\nOn August 6, the death of Mark\nDuggan during an investigation\nby police officers from Operation Trident two days earlier led\nto a protest outside Tottenham\nPolice Station. It is said that\ndue to uninvolved criminal elements a riot began in the area,\nin which two police cars were\nset alight.\nFor four consecutive days riots spread, first through different areas of London and then\nthroughout the country. The focus of the rioters seemed to be\nlooting and destruction instead\nof having a political or firm\nideal. There were several attempts by politicians and media figures to try to single out\nthe cause of the tensions that\nresulted in such widespread\ncrime but no one true agreement was reached.\nEurope\u2019s financial stability\ntook a huge blow this summer as Italy and Spain joined\nthe list of Eurozone countries\nwith unmanageable sovereign\ndebt.\nAfter a loss in confidence\nin the Euro and a rise in the\nbond yields for the aforementioned countries the European Central Bank stepped\nin and bought large amounts\nof Spanish and Italian bonds\nin a show of confidence. This\nmeasure caused some investor confidence to resurge\nleading to a fall in Italian and\nSpanish bond yields. However,\nwhen lower than expected Eurozone growth results were an-nounced, especially from their\neconomic stronghold Germany, investors began to panic\ncausing erratic financial market behaviour, with European\nshares losing the most.\nThis summer\u2019s events have\nled to people re-evaluating the\neffectiveness of the Eurozone,\nwith some German citizens beginning to despair at having to\nhelp fund bailouts for fellow Eurozone countries who struggle\nto manage their government\u2019s\nbudgets. Some people, including former French President\nand Prime Minister Jacques\nChirac are calling for the introduction of Eurobonds, bonds\nthat are backed by every country in the Eurozone, hoping to\nprovide a product with more\nstability. However this idea\nhas met strong resistance in\nthe form of incumbent German\nChancellor Merkel and French\nPresident Sarkozy.\nWith the uncertain future of\nEurozone fiscal stability, some\nconsider the summer of 2011\nthe possible first chapter of\nthe end of the Euro.\nPresident Obama\u2019s summer\nhasn\u2019t been as great as he\nhoped. This summer he has\nhad to deal with trying to increase the US Debt Ceiling.\nThe debt ceiling is a limit\nof debt owed to the public by\nthe government. This doesn\u2019t\nmean that the government\ncan\u2019t run deficits, rather this\npiece of legislation controls\nthe amount of money the US\ncan borrow from bondholders\nand public trust funds like Social Security. Unless this limit\nis increased the government\ncannot legally borrow any\nmore from these sources. This\nmeans the government would\nstart to run out of money to\nfund its departments and pay\nback its expiring debts (e.g.\nbond interests).\nUsually raising the debt ceiling doesn\u2019t cause a major\nissue in Congress however\nthe Republicans used it as\na chance to hold the government at gunpoint while it demanded budget cuts and the\nabolishment of certain federal\nprograms.\nAfter a very tense few\nmonths where temporary stopgap measures were agreed on\nby both parties, a compromise\nwas made between the demands of the Republicans and\nthe desires of the Democrats\nwhich allowed the bill to be\nsigned on the 1st of August,\njust before the government\nran out of money. However,\nMr Obama has suffered some\nnegative press as a result of\nhow close the government was\nto defaulting on some of its\npayments.\nFor a very long time the financial world has seen the US\nbonds as a very safe invest-ment, however after the US\ndebt crisis the markets are no\nlonger so quick to buy American debt, with many preferring\nto trade gold instead.\nThe crisis also led to ratings\nagency Standard and Poor\u2019s\ndecision to downgrade its assessment of US bonds from\nits top AAA rating in AA+,\nsomething that has caused\nthe US great embarrassment.\nAs early as March this year we\nsaw the Arab Spring develop\nand pick up pace. Countries\nacross the world were taken by\nsurprise as a series of revolts\noccurred in different nations,\nwith dissatisfied citizens rebelling against their distant\nand corrupt governments, led\nby the large amount of unemployed young people who used\nsocial networking to spread\ntheir ideals.\nThe most widely covered rebellion has been the uprising\nin Libya where Col Gaddafi was\nousted after 42 years in power\nby the determined rebel-led\nNational Transitional Council\nwith support from the United\nNations. At the time of writ-ing, the new leaders of Libya\nthe NTC are searching for Col\nGaddafi and his missing family\nwho are hiding with pockets of\nstill-loyal supporters.\nUK Europe US Middle East\nSenior politicians were derided for not immediately returning from their holidays after\nthe first day of riots. However,\neventually they returned for the\npeople with London Mayor Boris Johnson walking the streets\nof Clapham Junction trying\nto offer platitudes to the aggrieved public and Nick Clegg\nholding a public meeting in Tottenham Town Hall.\nAfter the riots had settled,\npolice named and shamed\nsuspected rioters, and after\npolitical pressure the justice\nsystem handed out harsh punishments to those convicted.\nThe Metropolitan Police were\nflooded by accusations of mismanaging their response to\nthe riots with many saying that\nthey had been too soft, leaving\nmany residents and business\nowners to be subjected to the\nfull force of the roving mobs.\nPresident Obama, not reading\nFelix. We need to break America...\nWhile this happens, weekly\nprotests are still taking place\nin Syria where the population are desperate to unseat\nPresident Bashar al-Assad. A\nseries of violent attempts to\nrepress the protests by the\ngovernment has lead to sanctions by the EU and US. Who\nknows what will happen as the\nyear comes to an end?\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\n\n"
