    "content": "25 January 1999 23\nHia Bomb!\nBritish R&B Bules OK!\nWhat'sUp People! A no the t year has rolled on by and we're all left wondering where the hell it went, in fact\nI'm still trying to figure out where the nineties went.\nEverything is happening so fast, I'm stood still while the world whizzes by all around me, or at least that's the way it seems. Record companies just add to my con fusion with the number of records that are appearing, every week there are more releases. Now don't get me wrong I love to see more tunes but the problem is\nthey're not all tunes, about a quarter are a waste of vinyl.\nThe problem seems to stem from the massive output\ncoming out of the States, not only is the R&B market\nflooded with records but the quality just isn't there. To\nme more important than just the sheer number of releases is the fact that these releases are holding back British artists and good quality tunes. My case in\npoint is Another Level, a fantastic group that just could-n't get a record deal over here, they were passed over\nagain and again, they eventually got their deal from the States. Surely though someone on, this side should have\npicked them up, but no! British R&B has not been getting nearly enough props and we gotta correct that,\nBritish R& Band hip-hop is on a high and we' ve got to\nkeep it there. There is more than enough talent out\nthere and it amazes me how people refuse to acknowledge it. Groups like Another fe vel. Damage, Nine Yards, Kle'shay and solo artists like Shola Ama, Kele Le\nRoc and Lyden David Hall are representing British style\nand we gotta represent for them and all the others trying to make it.\nQuick piece of news coming out of the States, the\nGrammy nominations were announced and Lauryn Hill\npicked up a record ten nominations for her solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. The album was hailed\nas one of the best hip-hop albums of the year, if not\nin the history of hip hop and now the establishment\nhave acknowledged Ms Hill.\nKle'shay are the latest all girl group to hit the\nstreets. I know what you're thinking, there are already\nway too many all girl groups out there, most of them\nare shit, so why do we need another one? Well we don't need no more, at least no more Spice Girls or Bewitched\ntypes whose sheer existence I struggle to justify, all I think is that there arc far too many stupid little shits with\nmoney out there buying that crap. Kleshay are different - they make qua lily music. As I tried to point out earlier Kleshay are a British group who make tunes that are\neasily as good as anything coming from the States. I heir\nfirst single Reasons dropped in the autumn; it didn't cause much excitement even though it was a solid tune\nshowing off the vocals of the girls over a wicked back\nbeat. Now they're back with their second single an uptempo number called Rush, this is a fine tune that\ndeserves to do well - so represent and check it out. .\nTimbaland is doing it! This year has started off with\nTimbaland bang in' out two A class tunes that quite simply do it. first up there is the Destiny's Child tune Gel\nOn The Bus which started to surface at the end of the\nyear on promo copy. This is so good that with most still\nunable to get hold of it the Why Do Loots Fall In Love\nsoundtrack has been selling like hot-cakes just so peeps\ncan check this wicked tune. About the same time Sony\nreleased a lead up single for the second set from Ginuwine, the absolutely stomping What's So Different, Timbaland pulls out all the stops and goddamn if this isn'ta tune that everyone needs to check and check fast\ncause this is so hot its burning up.\nMilen\nTLc are back/\nAlong time ago in a recording studio far far away, a group called lfC recorded their one and only hit in th\nUK to date, Waterfalls. Then they disappeared off the\nface of the earth!\nWell now TIC arc back, and have had a complete image change... gone arc the attitudes and the bad girl\nimages, and in is the new, modern image of I EC.\nAlright, so they've changed their image, so what? Well\nthey've also got a new album coming out in Ie bru ary, and having heard the first lew tracks, it is safe to say\nthe album is fucking superb. Ihe album is called fan Mail and the spectrum of tracks is large, there are\ndrum and bass tracks with hard hitting vocals, ballads,\nthumping bass lines and some super bR&B tunes. IEC\nhave pulled out all the slops on this album, and this is\nreflected by the; huge range of top producers working on the album, including Babyface and Jermaine Dupris\nto name a couple. The album is out in Ie bru ary on the 22nd in the UK\nand the 23rd in the US! More news soon...\nGurm\nBEVERLEY KNIGHT 'PZOblQM MIA'\nn1993 Wolverhampton\nborn singer\nBeverley Knight\nhad just started\ncollege and never\nsung outside of church, which had been a vital train-ing ground and an influence that\nstill remains with\nher now. Two years later Bev\nburst on to the scene at the raw age of 21 with her debut album, B Tunk, containing hits\nsuch as Flavour of the Old Skool and Movin on Up.\nThe success of B Funk saw Bev receive her first award\nfrom the Black Music Awards for Britain's best Female\nR&B act. Instead of exploding and continuing from this\nsuccess, she went underground as she tried to extricate herself from DOME, the label that launched her,\nfor EMI records. Now, aged24, Beverley is a little older\nand wiser has made it back after her recent success at\nthe MOBO' s with her brilliant sophomore Prodigal\nSista.\nOn this entirely co-written album she has been reunited with producers 2B3 as well as collaborations\nwith the leading lights of the UK R&B scene Carl Macintosh, Dodge and Don-E. The album kicks off with the\nclassic tune Made it Back featuring the renowned US\nhip-hop artist Redman reflecting the difficulties of the\npast few years. The rough and smooth experiences of\nthe past is where Beverley draws most of her lyrics. The\nalbum includes the recent summer track Rewind, which\nhas the same kind of message as Made it Back and her\nrecent release Sista, Sista. There are also some other\nclassic tracks such as the laid back AWOL and the\nmeaningful Strong Hand. The album finishes with a tune\nThe Need of You which has a blues feel and really\nshows the raw talent Beverley has. You better recognise!\nShe has definitely lived up to her first album sho wing she really has got what it takes to succeed. BK is definitely the most talented female UK R&B act now and watch for her live band performances which are\nabsolutely mind blowing. BK is currently on tour supporting Mor chee ba. Forget all this US cheese music for\nnow and recognise the raw UK talent of Beverley\nKnight.\nNim\nWhat I# een Checking\nGet On The Bus by Destiny's Child\nli rn bai and production is on point,\nthe girls kick It on vocals\nWhat's So Different by Glnuwlne\nGoddamn I his is good' My Love Is Your Love' by Whitney Houston I'm loving it\nDoc's Da Name by Redman\nThis pisses all over RZA's&even Meth' s albums,\nthe best Wu album yet\nRush by Kle'shay\nExcellent uptempo number from this first class British trio\nToo Old For Me by Jerome\nLatest tune from Bad Boy camp has little Jerome showing of his vocal talents to the; max Gimme Me Some More by Busta Rhymes\nBusta Is one bad ass muth a who' s giving all you can take\nDo You Feel Me by Men Of Vision\nDarkchlld on production and you will\nfeel this phat tune\n\n"

It doesn't matter\nwho the second ers arc, as long as\nthey're students, as noone ever finds\nout.\nWrite A Manifesto\nThis will be published in Felix and often\nis the starting point of your questioning\nin Hustings. In your manifesto you should\noutline what your policies and plans are\nfor the next year.

It's worth doing a bit of research so that you don't look like a complete idiot. The best sources are talking to the present and previous sabbat-ical s, reading past issues of felix (especially the news and letters pages) and reading previous ICU Council minutes.\nThis should give you some idea of what the current issues are, feelings of some of the students towards them and the way in which the Union works.\nRun A Campaign\nThese tend to take the form of mass pos-te ring of the campuses, varying from the funny to the 'these are my policies'\nto the 'look I'm sexy' type of posters, all\nfinishing with a 'so vote for me'. There\nhave been various other ways of seizing\nvotes used in the past. Flyers arc the\nmost obvious, and adverts in Felix, on the\nradio or the television station are common. If you haven't met people from other campuses yet get out to one of the\nbars and meet them; bring a large wal-let, there's nothing that a free drink can't settle. You could even be outrageous and visit some Union meetings and look\nkeen. Get People Out To Vote\nThis is the hardest part. No matter how well you' ve done so far, unless you can\nget people out of bed and to the ballot\nbox, there's no point. To vote students\nneed an ICU card that can be obtained through the Union Office. Taking the two days of voting off to get your face\naround is advisable.

    "content": "2 News 25 January 1999\nCornwall Eclipsed\n11 August 1999 promises to bean exciting day for stargazers and scientists\nalike. For the first time in over seventy years, Great Britain will be graced by the serenely staggering sight of a Total\nSolar Eclipse. For most Britons, this\nwill probably be the last chance to wit-ness the glorious spectacle of the appearance of the' diamond ring' as\nthe sun reappears from behind its\nshroud the next solar eclipse to achieve totality across Great Britain will\nnot occur before2090. The eclipse will be total over a path\nstretching from India up to the North Atlantic passing over the Isles of Scilly,\nCornwall, southwest Devon and Guernsey before touching north-east-ern France, Luxembourg, southern Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Rom ania - where the eclipse will be at its\ngreatest before moving into Asia. It\nwill occur shortly after 11 in them or nBy Sunil Rao\ning ( summer time) in Cornwall, and about2025 minutes later in France\nand Germany. Totality will last for just\nover two minutes in Cornwall. Eclipses occur when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon arc all lined up. Solar Eclipses occur at New Moon when the Moon comes in between the Earth and the Sun. On average, a total solar eclipse occurs somewhere in\nthe world every eighteen months. However, total eclipses occur at any given place only once every several\nhundred years on average. For\ninstance, the last total eclipse visible in\nLondon occurred in 1715; the next will\nnot occur till 2135! Solar Eclipses give\nscientists a valuable opportunity to\nstudy the corona of the sun, the changes that occur in the upper atmosphere and the consequent de grad ation in high-frequency communications and changes in wind patterns, and the generation of atmospheric waves, all of which will be studied by groups of British scientists.\nInevitably, most hotels and B&B accommodation in the path of totality\nhave been booked up months in\nadvance. However, accommodation will be available in homes as well as\nfarms, which can be booked from a number of travel agents. For the more' adventurous' and/or monetarily welle nd owed, eclipse tours can also be booked to Bavaria and Turkey, among other destinations, as can cruises to the Black Sea. Wherever you plan to view the eclipse, do take care not to view the sun without adequate protection carelessness, willful or otherwise, might\nresult in serious eye damage or even blindness. Oxford Fees Mean Business\nOxford University is considering setting\nup a new undergraduate course, with\nfees that could amount to \u00a315,000 every\nyear. This goes against the government's decision that fees should not be larger\nthan the \u00a31,000 most universities are charging.\nThe course is a four year business\ndegree, designed by Oxford's modern business school, and is discussed in\ndetail in the15 January issue of The\nTimes Higher Education Supplement. In the article Professor Kay, director of the school, is quoted as saying \"We would have to charge... the economics just do By Ed Sexton\nnot add up\". Part of the reason for the extortionate fees is the prospect of staff\nat the new school being paid up to twice\nOxford's standard salary of \u00a340,500.\nNational Union of Students sources were quoted as being \"shocked and dis-appointed... we said that the \u00a31,000\ntuition fee would be the thin end of the\nwedge\". Meanwhile the four remaining Oxford students who have not paid their\n\u00a31,000 tuition fee have had their university library cards confiscated, according to some sources. It is unclear what will happen if the students refuse to pay,\nwith the University Registrar, David\nHulme, being quoted as saying \"I will\nhandle that situation as and when it\narises\".\nA march against tuition fees took\nplace last Friday (22 January) in Oxford City Centre. Although details were unavailable at the time of going to press,\nTony Benn and Jeremy Corby n were believed to be present at the ma r ch, which was hoped to attract in excess of2,000 students.\nMl Mishap\nContinued From Page 2\nspoke to the students. They explained that it was illegal to walk on the hard\nshoulder and, according to PC Cambers( the officer on the scene) gave them\" a very stern talking to\". The medics caught a taxi to the nearest service\nstation, where they were picked up by\na Union minibus and sent home. College is treating the event very\nseriously, and the investigation now lies in the hands of Dr Anna ThomasBetts. She made it clear that action is\nnecessary because the incident could have had grave consequences but she also noted that she will treat the students exactly as if they were from any other department, and the unfortunate media coverage of the event\nwill not have an impact on her decision. Asked what he felt would form a suitable penalty, ICU President Dave\nHellard suggested that \"the publicity\nthat has surrounded the students is\nalmost punishment enough...I'd hope for, at most, a menial punishment\". More worrying, however, is the treatment that the students received from their own Union. They were all\ninterrogated individually by Wade Gaye d, President of ICSMSU - an action\ndescribed as \"wholly inappropriate\" by\nseveral senior sources and as a result\nreturned to Halls in a state of extreme panic. They had been led to believe that they faced very serious punish ment, but were given no idea of what to do or who to talk to. In their own words, they were\" completely in the dark\". It was only when they talked to\ntheir Hall Warden that they gained an explanation of the disciplinary system, and were put in contact with the Coll e ge advice and welfare system. The level of information provided by the organisers has also been questioned by\nsenior ICU figures, with Deputy President Marie Ni chola ou describing it as\n\"A great idea that was poorly organised by the Medical Students Union. A lot\nmore care should go into their fundraising events next year\". Wade Gaye d was unavailable for comment. issue 1133\n25 January 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nAssistant Editor & Films: David Roberts\nNews Editor: Andrew Ofori\nMusic Editors: Dennis Patrickson\n& Jason Ramanathan\nArts Editor: Helena Co che me Games Editor: Gary Smith\nClub scene: Giles Morrison& Joel Lewis\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nPhotographic Editor: William Lorenz\nIn brief...\nConsoc Sieged\nA slightly unusual site was to be seen by\nthe audience for the latest Cons oc event.

    "content": "25 January 1999 Games 21\nGadget Watch - Gameboy Color (Nintendo)\nThe Gameboy has been about forever- or\nso it seems. First there was the brick\nshaped, battery hungry, fuzzy screened Gameboy. The ban c of family get together everywhere, where little ten year olds\nwould bleep and beep their way to an early bedtime. Then there was the pocket\ngameboy. The new sleek, clear screened\ntoy for all those who had grownup with\nthe bricks, but had now all realised that\nform was above function. These little\npieces became the professional nerd's favourite travel companion. Then came the multi coloured pocket versions, where silver cases were replaced with colours of\nthe rainbow as well as the odd transparent version.\nBut for all these improvements weight, battery life, clearer screens - the\ngames themselves were black and white\n- surely not a worthy product to sell in the\nnext millennium. Nintendo though had a problem. The problem was in many ways a problem of its own success. So many games( over 1000) had been brought out for the black and white syst em that if they designed a completely\nnew system they would have to develop a whole new software library. So Nint endo instead have released the Game boy Color. Essentially it looks and performs like a gameboy pocket after a large dose of steroids (check\nthat battery\nbulge at the back and dis-agree). It plays\nmost of the old\nroms as well as\ndoing a good colour job.\nOne of the obvious improvements is\nthe new screen, made by Sharp. Gone are those annoying contrast controls that\nmeant that tilting the screen changed it\nfrom nuclear blast bright to nuclear wi nter black. The screen also displays the colours perfectly sharply and believe it or\nnot the colours do make a difference.\nThe sound doesn't seem to have been messed about with - though my version\nseemed to be set at a much more civilized quiet volume when compared to the old gam c boy pocket. The data link\nhas been speeded up and they have added an infra-red data\ncont to l port so that you can play\nlinked games without looking n.I ike a character\nLj l from a techno-MH fe. bondage party,\niI_ J_j( pr( but expect the\nuniversal remote\ncontrol cartridge and car alarm decoder stories to appear in the techno phobic parts of the press), finally there is a more powerful processor (so all of the steroids\nhaven't gone straight to the screen or to\nits rear), though it is able to use a slow\nmode to prevent the older games being too fast.\nNo honest - It looks good In colour\nSo worth buying? lor the gam c boy freaks and cult is tsa defina te yes - though some of these guys probably own aGa mc boy light (even smaller than the pocket). I or those who get bored on the long journeys, another yes( you might even get to windup the annoying\nmobile users), tor everyone else? Well as\ngadgets go it is neat, below seventy\npounds and will keep you occupied through the long dark hours. Its great for\ninsomniacs as well as kids, (though the\ninsomniacs will need a torch - the screen\nisn't backlit) Gary S. Preview Ville 2\nBullfrog and Codemasters attempt to float our boats\nBullfrog - Dungeon Keeper 2\nIn the old days, before the days of3 D video cards,\ngames had to be good using\nthings called sprites. A game without\na sense of hum out was a game to be played late in\nthe evening, usually by yourself. Fortunately games with a sense of humour were about in number and groups could be seen gathered round games like Sam and Max, and Dungeon Keeper.\nDungeon keeper\nappealed to the same amateur sadists\nthat would tear wings\nfrom flies and attempt to fry ants\nwith magnifying glasses. In Dungeon Keeper you created\nyour own dungeon, filled it with evil\nabominations and dark mistresses in\nblack leather, and then let them do rather\nnasty and evil things to heroes and adventurers that wandered in. Rumours\nabounded that there were versions deep at bullfrog towers filled with true polygon\ncreatures rather\nthan the diss a pointing blocky\nsprites that possessed our PC's. Well Bullfrog\nhave decided to recreate that\nrumour, and the beautiful poly-gon s arc every-where. Now you can also take\ncontrol of your characters and stuff the\ndwarf by your own bile demon's foul\nclaw. The magic clement has also been improved with new spells and better\neffects. Bullfrog has also\nannounced the launch\nof a Dungeon Keeper2 battle server,\njust so you and twelve\nfriends can chase each other\naround a virtual dark place with horned devils and bondage girls. Nice eh Jeff?\nCodemasters - Micromachines 64 Turbo\nThe Nintendo64 is unfortunately dead in the water. In the classic case of too little quality, and too late, Code masters have announced that Micro machines64 Turbo will finally make it out in time\nfor the Faster holidays.\nMicro machines, that rather classic\n2D game on the old Mega drive, managed to spawn an incredibly playable\nand enjoyable Playstation 3-D version\nlast year. The N64's3D capabilities will\nnot have been particularly stretched\nbut with up to 8 people able to play\nexpect it to be another of those Golde n eye style, gather round the IV,\neveryone having fun games( just prevent those bad loser Capricorns from\ntaking it too seriously).\nCI "

    "content": "25 January 1999 Columns 11\nTremor in Malaysia as Holy Festival Looms\nNik B Hafiz\nMr Ibrahim on his way to court\nAs Malaysians, who are predominantly Muslims, prepared for the Eid-ul-Fltr which marked the completion of the holy month of Ram adhan, the country was again stunned by rather shocking news. If the expulsion of Mr Anwar Ibrahim from the posts of Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister last September can be likened to an earthquake, then the much delayed admission by the government that\nAnwar was brutally beaten while in\npolice custody was more of a large\ntremor in nature. One subsequent result of this revelation was the resignation of the most senior police officer\nin the country, the Inspector-General of the Police, Rahim Noor, who took full\nresponsibility on behalf of the police. The police force had been very much in\nthe limelight ever since Anwar appeared in public sporting a black eye and over the months was severely scrutinised by the public over allegations of underhanded methods, brainwashing prisoners and brutality.\nOn the political front, the Prime\nMinister, Dr Mahathir, reshuffled the Cabinet earlier this\nmonth. One of the notable changes he\nmade was he himself relinquished the\nposts of Home Minister and li rst Finance Minister. He passed the baton\nto Abdullah Badawi, previously the Fore ign Minister, who was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister, ending months of speculation as to who will succeed Dr Maha thir as Prime Minister.\nn the courtroom Anwar was dealt\nanother massive blow, as the pre-siding judge, Augustine Paul,\nordered that all evidence involving alle-gat ions of his sexual misconduct be struck out, citing them to be ir rel event following the state prosecutor's amendment of the corruption charges he is\nnow facing. This is considered very\nunfavourable for Anwar, for after weeks of media exposure of prosecution witnesses claiming he committed sodomy and had an affair with his former sec-ret ary' s wife, his lawyers are now unable to counter the case presented by the prosecution as they could no longer refer to the sexual claims. How ever, it is Anwar's portrayal that matters;\nhe has spent many months having his\ncharacter assassinated without a platform to defend himself. The move also\ncreated even more complications for\nAnwar Ibrahim's defence team as the trial enters its second round, with the defence now calling their witnesses,\nwho include the accused himself and possibly the Prime Minister as well.\nWe need your,\nPoems, Short Stories, . . \u201e\nArtwork and Photography The Arts annual of Imperial College Like to seeyour creative work in print? create the fire which fills Findfll6OSSence Of V OUr Veil f SOIll\n\u00bbe void in your aching heart1 n ni9 ww m OU&i dh fau ir are ii VM' If VOU can helD Thursday lunch times in the Felix office\ny or at\nGive in to the art side\nPlease contact Shanaka and Ben;\nThursday lunch time\nor at\nphoenix@ ic.a c.uk We realise that Thursday lunchtime is\nimpossible for those who are not on the South\nKen. campus, Please e mail us and we will\ncome and see you.\n\n"

    "content": "18 Arts 25 January 1999\nIN FLAME\nBush Theatre\nSituated above the Fringe & Firkin\npub, the Bush theatre provides a cosy and casual environment for\nviewing innovative, contemporary pro-duct ions. Billed as \" a play about a beauty,\na frump, a mad mother, a dead girl, an idiot, a calamitous boy and a handsome stranger\" (quite a mouthful but enough variety to peak anyone' s curiosity), In\nFlame by Charlotte Jones is fantastic.\nAfter several drinks at the bar, the audience responded spontaneously to the witty script, sympathetic characters and unpredictable twists of the plot.\nThe play explores the relationship\nbetween past and present, alternating\nbetween modern day London and Edwardian Yorkshire. The parallel story lines\nlinked by family ties, often involving the same actors, are skilfully and logically\nintertwined, avoiding any risk of conf u sion. As the play unfolds, the contrasting\nparts - some eccentric, others mundane, but all recognisably human interact.\nThe result is an enchanting concoction of convincing drama, interspersed with genuine comic moments. The simplistic, abstract set serves as\na neutral background, smoothing the transition between scenes, separated in\ntime by ninety years.\nPublic sympathy wavers with each\nthrilling revelation, bringing personal involvement loa new dimension. The\ncaptivating denouement induced gasps\nof surprise from the audience, as the final\npieces of the puzzle fell into place.

    "content": "16\nReviews\nFilm\nThe Siege * * *\nStarring : Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, Tony Shalhoub\nDirector: Edward Zwick\n25 January 1999\nAs far as Hollywood is concerned, action-thriller is undoubtedly the genre to be in right now. Look at\nthe likes of Enemy of the State - king of the high octane action movie Jerry\nBruckheimer produces a film with plot\nand substance. It's even got good act-ing. Similarly, Ronin and even Star Trek:\nInsurrection eschewed explosions and body count in favour of tension, be liev ability and plot. Sure, their were some( excellent) set pieces, but these are driven more by the needs of the high-tech, high-danger storyline than the producer's demand that you blow something up every three minutes.\nSo it is with The Siege. It's got Bruce\nWillis In it. It's got a hell of a lot of terrorists in it. It's even got the US Army patrolling the streets of Brooklyn. Yet\nwhat Initially sounds like a blood coated\nno-b rainer quickly shows itself to be far\nmore politically aware, far more tense\nand far more surprising than you might\nat first imagine.\nWashington is an FBI agent who, by\ntracking down one set of arab terrorists\nuncovers a massive web of Islamic\nextremists prepared to destroy New York.\nThat's two deep-pan per rer ron l and mushroom. To go.\nHe takes assistance from a CIA spook( Bening) who happens to cross his path,\nbut to no avail, and soon the army is\ncalled in to defend the city - under the leadership of Willis. Suddenly the movie\nshifts into gear, as the systematic backstabbing (which the movies would have\nus believe is endemic in the US undercover security system) sets in. Willis clearly\ndoesn't trust Bening, thanks to her dubious role in the Gulf War. Washington doesn't trust Willis, believing that bringing tanks on to the streets can only result\nin violence. And Washington's long-suf-fe ring partner (Shalhoub) doesn't trust\nanyone when the army start setting up internment camps. Basically, it's paran oia city.\nBut if all that sounds typically Hollyw ood cheering on America as it flattens\nthe rest of the world - then think again.\nThe senator who suggests\" bombing the shit\" out of Libya, Iran or Iraq in retaliation is instantly shouted down, and the\nfinal half-hour resolutely sets out to prove\nthat terrorism is a state of mind, not a nationality. The only problem Is that you know you've seen each scene done better somewhere else. The surveillance in Enemy of the Stare was light years ahead,\nthe negotiation hung on a sharper knife-edge in The Negotiator, and the cameo from Bill Clinton was far more entertaining in Contact\nThe real problem with The Siege.\nhowever, is that it's deeply seated in the American psyche. In Europe, where we're far more used to terrorist atrocities,\nand didn't demand that the troops marched into London when the Canary\nWharf bomb exploded, it just seems like\noverkill. Q Dave\nMeet Joe Black * * * *\nStarring : Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani\nDirector: Martin Brest\nAn early candidate for most biz-z are plot concept of1999, Meet\nJoe Black is nothing if not orig i nal. For starters, at $100 million its far\nand away the most expensive romance ever filmed - with not an effect in sight.\nSecondly, it stars Brad Pitt as Death.\nOne of the world's most idol is ed men, playing the grim reaper. Interesting.\nAs ideas for a romance go, this is\npretty off the wall, with death deciding to come to Earth, to find out what being human is all about. He takes up residence in Anthony Hopkins palatial home( you can see where the budget went),\non the understanding that he won't kill\nHopkins whilst he learns about mortality.\nWhat he doesn't realise, however, is\nthat the previous owner of the body he has taken has met Hopkins' daughter,\nForlani. That very morning, they met in a diner, and Forlani began to fall in love\nwith the real Pitt. (Watch out for what happens in the final seconds of the scene, as its worth the price of admission\nalone.) Suffice to say, she is very con-Death c la early knows all the best holl day spots. fused when Pitt turns up at her father's house that evening...\nAdmittedly, on paper this probably\nsounds like pretty cheesy, entirely predictable stuff. However, thanks to brilliant\nperformances from all three leads, what\nresults is unashamedly romantic. Add to\nthat the fact that the ending is far from predictable, and the whole thing looks\nabsolutely gorgeous, and you've got a top film. Chick flick? Yeah - so what? Q Dave\nFilm\nCompetition\nLast week's film competition proved far\nharder than I had first imagined, with\nonly a handful of entrants correctly identifying the four actors who have so far\nplayed An nak in Skywalker in the Star\nWars movies. The correct answer was, of\ncourse:\nDavid Prowse (Body of Darth Vader)\nJames Earl Jones (Voice of darth Vader)\nSebastian Shaw (Return of the Jedl)\nJake Lloyd (The Phantom Menace)\nThe first five correct entries out of the hat\nthis week were from: Vicky Hudson\nSteve Roberts\nAnne Lyndon\nJamie Clydesdale\nAdam Scoot\nCould all p rise winners please drop into\nthe Felix office (in the south-east corner\nof Beit Quad) sometime this week to collect their prizes. Thanks.\n\n"

    "content": "25 January 1999 Columns 9\nWelcome to the new Felix cooking column. My aim in these articles is to show that anyone can knock\nup great food, without it costing the earth or taking ages\nto make. In my opinion you can get a long way simply\nby having some idea of what ingredients go together,\nand roughly what to do with the m.I'm not a big fan of recipes. It seems to me that far\nmore is achieved by getting off the beaten track and taking a few risks. Recipes are a good way of learning new techniques and good combinations of ingredients, but\nthey can't list all the options. The important thing to\nremember is that for most everyday cooking, recipes\nshould only be a guideline. Far too many things can vary\nbetween your kitchen and that of the recipe's creator\nfor the exact quantities of ingredients to matter. Similarly, the suggested Ingredients can often be substituted\nif you don't have the exact item mentioned. To start off with, here are a couple of light dishes\nboth of which can be whipped up in under half an hour.\nThey're both great for lunch, or as a starter.\nBroccoli Pesto, Serves 2\nWhen you talk about pesto, most people think of the green stuff in supermarket jars. While the classic basil\npesto is incredibly versatile, its only part of the pesto\nstory. You can make a pesto out of pretty much anything.\nThe only essential ingredients are olive oil, garlic, and either cheese or nuts. This tec i pe is one of my favorites.\nIts just fantastic served with a heap of fresh pasta.\n1 medium head of broccoli, chopped25 g grated parma san2 cloves of garlic\n2 tablespoons of olive oil\n3 tablespoons of cream\njuice of half a lemon salt and pepper\nThe first stage is to cook the broccoli. Unfortunately\nbroccoli is a very submissive vegetable, when simply\nboiled a good deal of the flavor is surrendered to the\nwater. The ideal solution is to steam it. If you must boil,\nmake sure the juices are saved for later. Either way, cook\nuntil pretty much all the bite is gone, about 10-15 min-ute s. Cooks\nCorner\nWhile the broccoli is cooking chop the garlic finely,\nthen fry very gently in the olive oil for a minute or two.\nBe really careful not to let the garlic burn, frazzled garlic must rank as one of the most unpleasant of tastes.\nWhen the broccoli is done add it to the garlic, and fry slowly for about 10 minutes, squashing any remaining big lumps. By this point the mixture in the pan should\nbe really soft, and quite smooth. Turn off the hob, then\nmix in the cream, parma san and lemon juice. Season\nto taste (for me, this means loads of black pepper!).\nFinally add a little water (from the pan if you boiled the\nbroccoli) to take the mixture to the consistency of single cream.\nAdd the pesto to a pan containing cooked and drained pasta, then stir well and serve.\nLeek and Manage tout Soup, Serves 4\nIhis soup is really warming but has a fantastic ly fresh\nflavor. It almost feels like spring has come early. Manage tout are available cheaply at markets, but the recipe\nis good with dwarf beans too. You really need access\nto one of those hand blenders to mush the whole thing at the end. If that is a problem, just chop up everything really finely.\n2 medium leaks\n200gofman get out30 g ish of butter (preferably unsalted)\n1.5 pints of vegetable stock\n1 tablespoon of plain flour\na couple of tablespoons of double cream\nsalt and pepper\nlop and tail the leaks and chop into fairly small slices.\nHeat the butter in a fair sized sauce-pan and s aute the\nleaks gently for about 10 minutes until soft. Mix in the\nflour and cook for another minute, then add the stock,\nstirring all the time to avoid lumps. Ih row in the man get out and boil until they're ready to eat, about\nanother 15 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the heat, then whizz it with\nthe hand blender. Add the cream and season.\nSummer Internships\nAn internship with Procter & Gamble is an\nopportunity tn gain real work experience\nwhile still at university, and have a lot of\nfun.

    "content": "6 Letters 25 January 1999\nOi You! STOP! READ THIS!\nDear Felix,\nFirstly, can I thank everyone that turned\nup at Shaft on the first week of term - you\nmade the hassle of getting the new capacity totally worth it, seeing 900 of you going mental made us realise that the effort had\nbeen worth it.\nBut ICU isn't all about drinking and\ndancing, so we want to find out what you\nall really think about your Union, and any\nsuggestions you might have to improve it.\nTo do this, we'll be doing the following\nthings:\ni) The introduction of comments and suggestions leaflets.\nYou will find these in all the Union outlets, and they are there so you can have\na direct input on any of our services - you\ncan tell us about anything that annoys you,\nor any suggestions you might have to\nimprove things. All you have to do is fill it\nin and put it in one of the collection boxes.\nThe Union will try and respond to any problems within a week and any suggestions\nthat get put into practice will be rewarded\nwith a E5 ICU voucher.\nii) The introduction of focus groups.\nBasically, over the next week many of\nyou will be chosen at random and sent letters about how you can get involved in\ngroups that will discuss good and bad\nthings about each of the following areas:\nUnion services, bars and catering, ents,\nand Union Retail.\nIf you arc chosen we'd really like to\nhear your views, and to encourage you,\nwe'll be offering free food and wine at the\ngroups. If you are not chosen at random,\nbut really want to get involved, then you can\ne mail me on m. horne@ic.ac.uk, and I can\nsend you details about the groups.\nRemember ICU is here to improve the\nquality of your life as students, and we can't do that unless you tell us what you\nwant, so get involved!\nCheers\nMark Home( Events & Marketing Man ager)\nRCSU Retaliates\nDear Felix,\nFirstly as members and secondly as\nofficers of the RCSU, we would like to reply\nto the column in last week's issue by Simon\nBaker.\nIn the RCSU Presidency elections, the\npercentage of electorate that voted was\nabout 5%. In the ICU Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies) elections, last term,\napproximately the same percentage of the\nelectorate recorded their votes, and in the\nelections for ICU President Dave Hellard\nabout 9 % of the electorate voted. Even in\nthe elections for Felix Editor, only about 9 %\nvoted.\nThe question as to whether the CCU's consider themselves in competition with\nICU is to be found in the amount of input\nthat the CCU's themselves have in the ICU.\nThe majority of Officers In the CCU's are also\nmembers of the appropriate ICU committee and work together for the good of the\nstudents in general, not just those in their\nown C CU. The current Welfare Officer, for\nexample, is also on the ICU welfare committee, and is not there merely to sit and\nlook pretty, but is also involved in representing the students. This can be seen by\nthe current Welfare Surgeries running in the\nRCSU office on Mondays between 12.30\nand 1.30pm. Mr Baker appears to be implying a them and us situation, which does not in\nfact exist. We would say that in everything\nthe CCU's and ICU work together for the\ngood of the students. However, the suggestion that this is not the aim of all involved\nshows that there is an underlying problem\nof the view of the CCU's that the college students are fed by such articles as those\nfound in Mr Baker's column.\nYours Sincerely, \u2022\nSimon Torn (RCSU President)\nJoanna Churchill (RCSU Publicity Officer)\nJames Farrar (RCSU Publications Chair)\nSouthside Shop\nDear Felix,\nAs a not overly atypical first-year student\ncurrently residing in halls in Prince's Gardens, I find myself on occasion discovering\nthat I have run out of milk or juice or whatever cs sent i al ish grocery item I 've managed to leave lying around or have, quite\nsimply, consumed. So now where do I go\nto replenish my stock? The nearest supermarket - Sainsbury'son Cromwell Road is a good twenty-minute walk away. Hart's and\nLord's are closer but usually considerably\nmore expensive; aaa ahh h,I hear you say,\nthere's always the Southside Shop, but this\nplace is extortionate, to say the very very\nleast.\nTo me at least, it seems patently absurd\nthat a shop run by a college, primarily for\nthe benefit of its students who almost by\ndefinition are by and large in a state not far\nremoved from poverty, should be at all\n\"pricey\". Apparently, \"insistent\" students\nreceive a10% discount, but the issue still\nremains - the prices are still high - and a further question crops up - why is it only \"in s is tent\" students who are thus privileged?\nWhy not everybody else? It's about time\nsomething was done about this place -1\nmean, is this college meant to be a mere\nmoney-making machine, whose sole purpose of existence is the churning out of\nstreams of. fresh, bright-faced graduates\nclutching their degree certificates year after\nyear? Surely not! The College bears the\nresponsibility of providing us with services\nit is reasonable to expect, and this is one\nsuch service!\nIf it's not possible for the College to\nreconsider its pricing scheme, I wonder If\nit would be possible for the Union to take\nover the running of the shop. The Union\nShop and the Union Newsagents are far\nbetter in this regard than the Southside\nShop is, and I do hope something can be\ndone to repair the sorry situation.\nYours sincerely,\nSunil Rao (1st year ISE)\nTeaching Troubles\nDear Felix,\nI write in response to the article\n\"Brightening Prospects\" (Issue 1131) by\nClaire Bayntun. This is just a( lot of) word(s) of warning. In July 1994 I spent 4 weeks( of\na planned 8) with Teaching Abroad in\nMoldova, a former Soviet republic. I was\nworking as an English language assistant for\nRomianian university students who were on\na summer course. Which was fine. What\nwas not fine was the feeling that I had been\ntruly stitched up by a certain Dr Peter Slowe\n(of Teaching Abroad fame). I shall detail his\ncrimes:-a) The cost was \u00a3550. This was to cover\na return journey to Moldova, my food and\nboard, and one supposes the salaries of the\nyear-off ites whose care and organist at ional skills I entrusted.\nb) \u00a3550 sounds quite cheap for 8\nweeks away you may say. True, but I was-n't in New York, I was in Belsty. I calculated\nthat my return journey cost (at a maximum)\n\u00a3100. We went on a bus you see. Even\nthough we were told that a flight was in\norder. A bus is fine. 24 hours on a bus is\nfine. As is 48. As is 72. Well 72 isn't, but relative to 100 on one that only stops every 10\nhours and doesn't have a toilet, and has 10\ntoo many people on it, it is (Ok that is).\nc) He claimed that my 550 covered my\nboard etc. This was possibly his biggest\nand most regretful lie. I stayed with a lovely\nMoldovan family, for them it was honour\nto have a westerner staying at there home. I was treated like royalty, with the best hospitality they could offer. Had my \u00a3550 contributed in any way to this? Oh, no.\nEverything I received was from the pocket\nof a Mold ov an lorry driver. How guilty did\nI feel? I left them 100 dollars saying it was\nfor my one3 minute phone call to the Uk.\nClaire Bayntun is correct, working abroad within an entirely new and fascinating culture is worthwhile (and yes IC stu-dents, I'm sure it earns your ever-so-valuable\nCV points). But Dr Slowe is, from my experience, selling you a dream at a price. He\nis making money from the kind of ideas that\nMs Bayntuns' article espoused. If you want\nto work abroad it is not necessary to pay\nanyone anything to organise it for you,\nsort something out yourself. I believe that\nemployers also value initiative.\nYours sincerely,\nNick Chatterton\nLay Off The Pills!\nDear Felix,\nI'm writing for a bit of a moan at last\nweeks \"Agony or Ecstasy?\" article. In no\nway do I encourage the use of drugs or rec-om mend them, but if you are going to do\nan article about ecstasy, then you might\nconsider getting somebody who has had\nexperience with the drug to write the art i cle. Yes, taken in extreme quan i ties pills can\nfuck you up, but this can also happen t with\nalcohol, dope or even vast quan i ties of\nchocolate. Most people don't use pills as a general drug but more as a recreational\ndrug for clubbing. The person who wrote\nthis article has obviously had a bad experience with pills, and although this does happen to most people every so often, it is\nusually due to misuse of the drug and a general lack of common sense. The effects\nof pills described in the article are uncommon and It sounds as if she's been given\na dod gy deal. Pills aren't good or bad but\nthey are individual, so don't get caught in\na Rutt and think they are the spawn of\nSatan, because they're not.\nAnonymous Get Your Kit Off!\nDear Felix,\nAs a former SNkPJer myself, I feel I should clear up this matter of gender for the\nSNKPJ. This week's Felix [Issue 1132 - Ed] (p12) states that you must be male to participate in the SNKPJ. The Police are adamant\nthat this is not really acceptable, and are\nliable to charge people this year. When I got\ncaught in my first year, they said that they\ncould quite easily have charged me with\npublic indecency (\u00a31000 fine and 14 days\nin jail), but would have no case against me\nif there were a female participant. The lack\nof females in previous years is not due to\nany rule or tradition, merely that none of\nthem have the courage to get their kit off\nand run naked for charity. The reasoning\nbehind the official viewpoint is that women are allowed to be offended if they see\nmen's tackle, but not if there are a few fannies on show as well. This is mad, but there\nis a legal precedent, so that's what counts.\nIn fact, a few years ago, a female member of college volunteered for the SNKPJ.\nUnfortunately, she got sponsored more\nmoney _ not_ to take her kit off, so stayed\nat home. Can I also add that the SNKPJ was\none of the weirdest and proudest moments\nof my life, running past the screaming\ncrowds, stopping traffic, and generally having a laugh. The victory lap round the Albert\nHall singing 'Rule Britannia' should be reinstated this year, if people have the energy.\nCheers,\nMike "

This error of judgement was paid for in\nthe first few minutes when small patch\nof wind assisted RCS pressure concluded with the flying hooker crossing over the line to make it a07 nightmare start.\nThe sturdy men at C&G responded by\nblasting up the pitch for Dave \"Energlzer\nbunny\" Pearce to dive over. A reluctance to soil their new shirt by tackling\nwas cruelly exploited by Andy fit tle who took a light jog through their defence.\nOur boy Sven scored another converted try and half-time brought the wind to our backs with the score 17-7.\nThe second half started with a mighty\nRCS push into our steely defence. C&G took everything and wanted more, repulsing attacks with crunching tackles\nfrom Nipply, Sven, John and everyone.\nMistakes were punished, the Sublime\nChicmutter ran half the length of the pitch to score shortly followed by a scything run from Sven.\nRCS pulled themselves out of the mud and started to show us how it\nshould done scoring 2 late tries giving\nC&G a nervous last 5 minutes. The margin between the teams was measured in brutal tackling everywhere and some hard running from Will and Sven.\nAnother day, another ref., things could have been different, but as the sun set\nover Harlington it was the C&G boys signing in the circle.\nSam Hignett is a first year Materials student at Imperial. But he also spends a third of his year doing something marginally more interesting - driving racing\ncars. He was interviewed about his pas-sion:\nTell us about your racing?\nI reckon that all told, I will spend about\n100 days in a racing car this year.\nThe Formula Vauxhall Is your major\nchampionship this year. Tell us about It.\nWell in '99 Iam driving for John Vilage\nAutomotive in the British Formula Vauxhall Championship, racing alO Occ T KM kart and doing a couple of Formula Ford\nraces. That's all at the moment. That's all. How much time does that take\nup?\nIt Is 16 races all around the country on the TO CA package, so Iam one of the support races for the British Touring Car\nChampionship. There is full satellite and some terrestrial television coverage and plenty of press coverage, so it is a really\ngood championship for young up and coming drivers.\nAnd the car?\nIt's a single seater, so the wheels stick\nout like a F1 car, but it has no wings or\nother downforce aids. Iam told that off\nthe line, if you get it right, it will go from0 lOOm ph in under 5 seconds so it is\npretty quick. All the cars are identical and so it is just up to the driver and the engineer to set the car up and make it competitive at each circuit. At somewhere short like Brands indy circuit there is less\nthan a second between pole and20 th on the grid so it is close hard racing.\nINTERVIEW\nYou said about your engineer - what\ndoes he do?\nHe looks after my car basically. He makes any adjustments that need to be made, prepares the car before I drive it\nand rebuilds it when I crash it. The relationship that you have with your engineer is really important and can be the difference between winning and losing.\nIt is the same for all the guys that Iwork with. I have a manager, a guy who does the PR work for me, the team ma nager and my engineer. If you work hard\nfor them and show enthusiasm they will\nwork hard for you, and you will be competitive. How does all this affect your life as a stu-dent?\nWell at times Iam testing twice a week and racing all weekend, that means Iam doing up to 800 racing miles and600 travelling miles a week, so it can be\nquite a strain. Work hard, play hard.\nAnd what about your social life?\nNo, that doesn't suffer. Iam really lucky\nin that all my friends are really supportive of what Ido and so help me out a lot. I don't really drink, that's a fitness\nthing, but I still have a real laugh and make an arse of myself as much as any drunk person. Actually Iam quite good at that.\nSo you have to be fit to race?\nYes, reasonably. It is as much about\nbeing able to concentrate in extreme\nenvironments. It isn't that hard physically\nto drive the car, it is coping wil h the Gloadings and keeping a clear head. Also\nthe fitter you are the less likely you are\nto injure yourself when you stick the car\nin a wall, and so the sooner you can get\nback into the car.\nAccidents I suppose are part of the job?\nWell most of us will try to avoid having\naccidents, but they happen simply\nbecause you are so close to the edge. I think that Iam quite good and generally\ndon't crash race cars, but the formula Vauxhall championship is pretty aggressive and there is a fair amount of con tact, so there are quite a few moments. How do your family view your racing with\nthe risks Involved?\nThey are great and were the ones who got me into it in the first place and so are\nwell aware that the highs are high and the lows are low. No, they are all really\nsupportive as is my girlfriend, and I think\nshe gets the worst of it sometimes. It all sounds quite serious, Is It?\nIt wasn't, but it is beginning to dawn on me how serious it is all getting. Contracts\nhave six digits in them and my girlfriend\nmet some random blok e in fran ee who, much to her surprise, mentioned my\nname when talking about motor racing.\nI signed a contract the other day that\nstated that I wasn't allowed to ski, rock\nclimb, parachute or partake in any other\ndangerous activities for the rest of the\nyear.\nWhat about the future, what do you\nhope to do?\nOne season at a time. Let's see how we go this year.\nBut do you have any exciting plans or\nopportunities?\nIam doing a publicity photo shoot with\none of the girls who models these wo nder bra things.\nYou have a gl rl fr el nd Yeah.\nOriginally published elsewhere\nAround IC & Beyond\nMon 25 Tues 26 Wed 27 Thurs 28 Fri 29 Sat 30 Sun 31\nCA G: Tools for Self STA Bar Trivia DaVinci's RAG Street Collection - LabSoc - Frank Dobson He doni zm, ICU, \u00a31 RAG The Field Cup Reliance, Basement of8 pm meet at 12.30pm, Beit 1pm9 pm2 am meet at 11.45am, Beit\nBeit Quad6 pm CA G: Soup Run, BaseQ u ad Environment alSo c Quad Environmental Soc-Tim ment Kitchen, Weeks ConSoc - Sir Teddy Taylor Jeremy Leggett, Me ch Lubrication, dBs, FREE\nFoxon, Physics Lecture Hall 8pm1 pm Eng 542 6pm9 pm12 am Theatre 2 6.30pm RAG Variety Show, dBs,\n\u00a32 8pm Caving Club Meeting, Southside Upper Lounge9 pm Clay ponds Ice Skating\nat Bayswater - contact\nian.doyle@ic.ac.uk\nClub XS, ICU, FREE\n9pm1 amC AG: Soup Run, Basem ent Kitchen, Weeks Hall 8pm Idiot Son @ Twelve Bar\nClub, \u00a35 8pm RAG Hypnotist, dB's, \u00a33\n8pm Cocktail Night, DaVinci's511pm "

    "content": "20 Games 25 January 1999\nThief - The Dark Project (PC)\nEidos \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLike a thief in the night, you stole my heart. Well, if it wasn't bolted down and housed in a lead-lined box outside Euston station this game would do just\nthat. But enough of my personal life;\nThief : The Dark Project (to give it its\nrather long and not all that helpful sub title) is a complete steal of a game. Keep your mass murdering Quake series, forget the subtle interaction of Half-life characters just remember above all to keep to the shadows and above all keep stealthy in this original first-person action-adventure.\nSo how original is original? The main\ncharacter Garrett was once a petty cut-purse, who after doing a bit of training\nwith the local hooded mystics who call\nthemselves the watchers (or something equally mystic), has become a master of evasion, weapons and has the unnerving\nability to nick anything not nailed down. Apart from the kleptomania element it\nsmells\nawfully\nlike a certain\nNinja\ngame called\nTen chu on the Playstation.\nSmell,\nyes,-taste, no. Perhaps\nthere is a certain need to use stealth and intelligence. A game where running in\nwith a pair of size eleven pixie boots\ngives the wrong impression but sneaking\nup from the shadows and smacking them over the head with a bit of lead in\na leather bag cuts out the need for all\nthose nasty em baras sing first night conversations. But why should intelligent\ngame play be limited to anyone game? Anyway,\nkilling people in this\ngame is generally\nfrowned upon( though take heed of the generally bit).\nSet in one of those thousands of alternate worlds where swords and magic exist, though never in a state of perfect\nharmony,\nGarrett has\nbeen employed to do a few jobs for a mysterious\ncharacter\ncalled Constantin o. These jobs\ninvolve\ngetting in\nand out of buildings without attracting\ntoo much attention from the guards either plodding the beat round town or\nactually guarding the house. The best\nway to do this is to hide from them. Extinguishing candles and lamps with\nyour water arrows and you create your\nown shadows to skulk in. Place moss on the floor to\ndeaden your foot-steps. If you really\nhave to take them out it is possible and a good deal\nsafer to do it at\nrange. The bow becomes the sniper weapon of choice and a nice\nclean arrow in the neck will silence\nthe most annoying\nof guards (if you miss, the guard is\na bit miffed and attempts to show you the colour of your stomach lining).\nThe levels arc very large, and with\nthe dynamic lighting effects and poly-gon s making up the surroundings they\nare graphically impressive. Good as the graphics are, it is the use of sound that\nis really original. Throw a bottle onto the\nfloor and if the guard hears it, they will\ninvestigate the bangs and clatters (an\nIdeal opportunity to send a guard the\nwrong way for a few minutes). Voices\ngrow louder as they approach, and can be used to time your attacks. For the first\ntime, it makes more sense to listen for\nenemies rather than pop round corners\nto look for them. Thief has managed to\nsteal the title of intelligent action adventurer from both the bu some d Lara and the fully kit ted Ninja. Whether Metal Gear\nSolid will just leapfrog them all will be a competition worth watching. Gary S.

    "content": "12 Science 25 January 1999\ncie n ce EJcii\nThe paranormal, near death experiences, telepathy - science fiction or science fact?\nThese are Just some of the subjects being debated by the Scientific and Medical Network,\nan organisation whose membership boasts, not bare feet hippies, but some of the best\nnames in science. Simone Macmillan investigates...\nIn1973 a British civil servant, George Blaker, teamed up with GP Patrick\nShackleton, and founded the Scientific and Medical Network. Their remit\nwas to establish\" a broader spiritually\ninspired understanding of the world.\" Blaker, who had held posts in num e rous government depart-ment s, was concerned by the restrictions placed on scientific debate and funding. The founders thought that\npeople would turn to doctors and scientists for \"...credible explanations of why the world and conditions were as they were.\" So initially, membership was by invitation only, being directed at\nsenior scientists and doctors. Today,\nanyone can join, but full membership is generally reserved for graduates. The Network now has 3000 mem bets worldwide, two thirds of which are from scientific backgrounds. The Network sees itself mainly as a forum for discussion and the d is semi nation of information. It publishes its\nown journal, has local discussion groups, and organises conferences, two of which are open to the general public. It has Charitable Trust status,\nbeing largely funded by subscriptions. Underpinning many of the members' interests is the challenge of establishing a science of consciousness, and a movement away from objective sci-en ce to a science of the subjective.\n\" Consciousness has been ripped out of science\" according to Dr Peter Fenwick, Chairman of the S MN Council, and an eminent Consultant Neuropsychlatrist. Director David Lorimer con curs, saying science\" cannot be treated\nfrom the first person objective point of view...we as human beings are looking\"... Conscious-ness has been\nripped out of\nscience...\"\nfrom the inside out.\" There is a strong emphasis on the spiritual in S MN literature; both Lorimer\nand Fenwick share an interest in near\ndeath experiences, fenwick is involved in a project studying this\nphenom in um based at\ntwo centres attached to\nUK hospitals. Although Fenwick won't be drawn on whether there' s life\nafter death, he says that\nnear death experience, poetry and meditative states indicate that reality\nconsists of \"love, light and consciousness.\" Fenwick adds that he would believe in God, if the term could be broadened to encompass an intelligent\nconscious force, for i mer has written a book on near death experiences; 'The\nWhole in One'. He describes himself as\nspiritual rather than religious, saying\nthat \" a lot of members have made that\ndistinction, because people feel hampered by the limitations of both orthodox science and orthodox theology.\" However, he does believe that consciousness s ut vives physical death;\" in a nutshell my thesis is\nthat we are all connected and share one consciousness... what wear c doing to others we are in\na sense doing to our-selves...the golden rule is\nnot just a precept, but actually the way things work given the oneness and connected ness of consciousness.\" Is orthodox science still prejudiced against S MN views? Nobel Laureate( physics,1973) Prof Brian Josephson, whose interests include psychokinesis or the influence of mind on matter,\nthinks that it is. Hence his web page on the internet where, amongst other things, he prints articles to counter the\" negative propaganda... denouncing parapsychology.\" As a professor and Nobel Laureate he acknowledges that\nhe commands a \"better attention fac-tor\" than young physicists expressing similar views; they, he says, would have\nto overcome the \"laughter effect.\"\nGalileo is frequently mentioned, so do the S MN scientists consider them selves modern day Galilees? In their\ncase, paradoxically, they would be under siege by orthodox science and not the Church. The response is varied,\nwith Lorimer seeing some similarity;\n\"...a lot of scientists are not prepared, like the cardinals, to look down the telescope...to look at evidence which is\ngoing to undermine the way they\nunderstand the world.\" Prof Chris\nClark, councilmember and physicist,\nfeels that it is arguable that Galileo 'asked for it'; he points out that the\nS MN take a different approach, that\nthey are not \"...trying to launch a frontal\nattack on science but to extend it...real-ising that we are all trying to discover\nthe truth.\"\nHow would the Network like to change the way science is run in the UK? By focussing on education, incorporating courses in the history and phil o soph y of science into science A level\nand undergraduate programmes. Prof\nJosephson add she'd like\nto tell those in charge that the present situation\nin science is \"absurd\", for\nas a physicist he has learnt \"that there' san incredible range of pos-sib li ties in nature - in a complex situation, you should not think that something is\nimpossible.\" for further Information:\nThe Scientific and Medical Network,\nDavid Lorimer, Cibliston Mill, Collinsburgh, Leven, Life KY9 1JS, Scotland\nwww. cis.plym.ac. uk/SclMedNet/home.htm\nProf Josephson's web page:\nhttp://www. tcm.ph y. cam.ac. uk/-b dJ10/\"... we are all\nconnected and\nshare one con-s cio us ness...\" "

    "content": "14 Feature 25 January 1999 25 January 1999 Feature 15\nm Last autumn, a six-strong group of IC students headed for the mighty Himalayas, With a little help from sherpa s, cooks and porters they succeeded in\ntrekking through the Rolwaling valley and climbing peaks in excess of six thousand meters. Jeremy Thomson reports on the success of the expedition.\nIt's half past five in the morning, ten degrees below zero\nand we're camped on rubble at 5700 meters above sea\nlevel. You try getting out of bed.\nThe thought of all the effort we've put in so far, cou pled with several cups of warm tea, provide just enough\nFarm houses in Rolwaling valley\nmomentum to shed the lovely down sleeping bags and prepare for the climb. After four weeks of trekking and climbing, today we hope to reach the summit of; th f: mountain Parchamo. At about 6 2 2 5 m or 20,800 feet it\nis taller than Mont Blanc and Ben Nevis combined and! a greater altitude than any of us have ventured to before.\nAs we prepare, nervous glances shoot back and forth\namongst us and the hill above, bathed in watery dawn sunlight. Unlike Alpine climbing, we have neither reliable maps nor guide books, nor even an accurate value\nfor the mountain's height, so we're apprehensive about\nwhat may lie ahead.\nThe climb starts by heading back to the pass we crossed the day before, which at 5 7 0 0 m is one of the highest regularly used in Nepal,\nand affords superlative views\nof both the Khumbu( Ever-est) valley ahead of us and the R ol waling valley from where we came.\nWe rope together into\ntwo parties of four and our expedition leader, Alan, leads up the gentle sn of v slopes\nat a good steady pace. The tack of oxygen at this height\nmakes everything feel twice\nas steep as it really is, and it's important not to fatigue\nyourself early on. The sun has not yet reached us and it is deathly\ncold, especially on the feet.:\nI'm climbing in leather boots\nrather than die warmer plastic ones and my toes are\nsoon numb. Mercifully, after a steeper climb on which someone has left behind fixed ropes, we reach a little\nplateau and take a rest. Concerned about getting frostbite I whip off the boots and begin massaging my toes.\nThe sherpa s join in and in no time they're pink and happy again (the toes, that is).\nWe traverse around into the sunshine and follow an elegant ridge\nline that swings around onto the\nhorizon. The crest is narrow and fragile, so we follow some tracks a little below passing sparkling ice\ncaves and snow formations straight\nout of a seismology textbook.\nPresently, the summit ridge looms into sight, a handsome broken\nsnow line stretching away ahead.\nAfter negotiating a few steep sections\nthe top is suddenly in reach. All fatigue drops away to be replaced by\na silly and intoxicating sense of euphoria. We' ve done it!6225 m high in the middle of the most beau\nti ful mountains tn the world The\nweather's perfect (as Pasang's Lama\npredicted), the air is ludicrously clear and the sky's so\nbig it's black around the edges. 1 throw my arms around\nTom, who has just arrived, and nearly break his nose!\nwith my helmet.\n\u00a5,-. From our eyrie we can see a hundred miles each\nway and have a clear view of Mount Everest Makai u^ the fish-fail mountain'), Ama dahl am and many more.\nIn fact, our incredible panorama includes ei gli r of the\nearth's fourteen SOOOm-peaks.\nFrom Small Steps...\nIt all started more than a year ago, when after a good\nday's climbing in Wales Alan turned\nto me and unceremoniously said\n\"let's go on an expedition\". At the\nrime I wasn't keen, feeling the same\nway about mountaineering as drunk\ndriving - great fun but una ccc pt ably dangerous.\nBy last Christmas though the\nplans were starting to condense and\nwe had five people interested, all of us IC students. We bought amap of Nepal, fashioned\nthe 'trekking peaks' from b hi tae and sti uk them on the\nmap,( Trekking peaks are a set of apparently randomly selected\nmedium size mountains with affordable peak fees). One area stood out the R ol waling valley - which n clude s three trekking peaks, gave\nsensible acc lim at is ation and a good varied trek.\nThe prospect of travelling half\nnp^f jet en ji Thom s* way a(T0 SSt| leg|0 be to climb in the\nworld's highest mountains still seemed more of a fantasy than an intention, that is until we wrote a detailed:\nprospectus and applied to the IC Exploration Board for\nfunding They approved the plan and gave US 1:3000 We found a sixth climber contacted ^ agency in Kad i* Imandit and the te was no goto* back\nTrekking in the Valley We depart e jy if the end ot Septemhet in order to trek\nin die dry,|?bst monsoon season.

The\nlocals were curious, but\nfriendly and very\nhelpful and our sherpa s Kwangde seen from the Everest valley treated us\nlike royalty until it became embarrassing.\nAs we ascended the steep-sided Rolwaling valley\nwith its powerful river, the scenery began to change. We soon left the steamy sub-tropical jungles behind and progressed through deciduous woodland to scrubby\nrhododendrons and juniper. Few tourists visit here, and\nit is as authentic a sherpa settlement\nas you will find. The houses are small\nand simple and the locals cultivate\npotatoes and raise yaks. When we reach the highest village, Na, we are\nwell above the tree line and the residents have deserted for the winter.\nFrom this airy spot, we launched an excursion to climb two\npeaks - Yalung Ri and the unfortunately named Ram dung. While the\nfirst went well, our progress on the\nsecond was hampered by deep snow\nand misleading maps, and it was\nsummit ted only on the second\nattempt by the expedition 'B team'.\nBuoyed up by our successful\nattempts on our fu st leal luma lavas we started the gruelling trek to the lop of the valley\n: :\nas rd lS^ ken ji^di:: s rbi ry glaciers. Camping in pre cari ois spots we had ro be wan, ot stone fall and were lucky\nenough to witness a dramatic avalanche |ii st tar enough\naway not to pose any dan gei By the time we reached\nthe high Tesi Labsra pass we were exhausted and contused from the altitude and sunlight, but had made it\nover the notorious crossing without incident.\nAfter the Parchamo climb, we quickly dropped down into the K lui mb u( Everest) valley which in contrast is teeming with mostly American trek kcr s armed\nwith flailing ski poles. The k lui mb u has done well from mountaineering (Everest attempts pass through here)\nand the houses are large and strong, tea houses, shops,\nschools and even surgeries are plentiful on the well built\ntrail and it was with a slight sense of disappointment that we re-entered\ncivilisation with its cafes, electric\nlights and real toilets.\nWe still had one more peak to\ntry, which lies high upon the west\nof the trail in a. little-visited valley\ncalled Eum ding Karka: An infuriating\nfew days spent getting lost and hacking through rhododendron forest\nfinally rook us to our destination,\ntowering above which was the triple\nmountain Kwangde. By now. winter\nwas setting in and the nights were\ngetting cold and the days shorter.\nAfter some debate, only two members wanted to attempt the climb which was die most difficult so far. They found the geography massively changed since the map was written,\nwith a new lake blocking the way to two of the three\npeaks. Turning their attention to the third, Kwangde\nN up, Alan and Tom set up an even-yet-still-higher\ncamp and went for it.\nOn the day of the climb, Alan was ill leaving just\nTom and sherpa Pasang. They made a bold attempt, but\nfound the glacier badly crevasse d. After having negotiated several very steep ice steps, they were finally\nthwarted by a huge crevasse just a hundred vertical\nmeters from the summit. Avalanche on Bigphera Go Shar\nReflections\nFlying back to Kathmandu from a minute airstrip in\nan aging Twin-Otter left us some spare time to reflect on\nthe trip. It's difficult to imagine a country less similar to\nEngland than Nepal, socially, culturally and geographically While climbing in the Himalayas was a wonderful\nexperience, it's the friendly, uncomplicated attitude and infectious cheerfulness of the Nepalese that I 'll re mem ber] The respect and tolerance generated by Hindu and\nBuddhist worship, the happy attitude of locals who were poor but not worried about it and the truly different\nart and culture of Nepal - these are what set the experience apart.

News of the incident first filtered\nthrough on Friday evening, when the BBC contacted both the College and the Union in response to traffic reports,\nwhich claimed that protestors were causing a hold-up on the Ml just outside of Luton. These \"protesters\" turned out to be nothing of the kind, and were in fact a group of seven first year\nmedics participating in the Rag Dash, which involved hitchhiking to Nottingham and then catching a coach to\nEdinburgh. Furthermore, early BBC traffic reports suggesting that \"ped estr i ans were stopping traffic...on all three\nlanes of the motorway\" were dispelled by the first police officers to arrive on the scene, who found \"seven IC stu-dents...who were on the hard shoulder about half a mile north of junction11\". Unfortunately, the cause of those involved was further hindered by the fact that a cameraman from Anglia TV\nhappened to be accompanying the police, filming a fly-on-the-wall documentary, and consequently the incident made its way on to Saturday's TV\nround-up, as well as several national\nand regional radio stations.\nWith first-hand reports now avail-able, however, the incident has taken on a more innocent tone, described as\n\"stupid but not malicious\" by College Tutor Anna Thomas-Betts. I hc medics left South Ken in full medical greens with instructions to hitch-hike to Nottingham. They were told that female students should not accept lifts on their\nown, but were apparently given \"no further instructions...they did not advise us\nthat hitch-hiking on the motorway was illegal\". A passing lorry driver gave the seven students in question a lift to Luton, but when they were dropped off they had no idea where they were. Having failed to find a lift on the main road leading away from the motorway,\nthey \" attempted to secure a lift along the slip road and eventually proceeded along the hard shoulder of the Motorway itself...we hoped that either there\nwas a service station nearby, or else we would be able to obtain a lift by showing our rag signs\".\nIn a statement given to College, the first years clearly pointed out that\n\" none of us were aware at the time that\nwe were doing anything illegal, and at\nno point did we enter any lane of the Motorway\". Nonetheless, the police soon arrived, and temporarily stopped the Northbound traffic whilst they\nContinued on Page 2\nSt Mary's Lead Battle Against CJD\nThe CJD Research Centre at St Mary's Hospital has developed a new method of diagnosing the new variant of Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease. The researchers, led by ICSM's Prof John Collinge, tested samples from tonsils of patients suffering from suspected prion\ndiseases.\nPrion diseases, such as\nCJD, are caused by a build up of an abnormal form of a prion\nprotein in the brain, causing\nsevere neurological disorders,\nand eventually death. Until\nnow, however, it has been impossible to diagnose the condition except by exam i ning sections of brain tissue\nafter death. nvC JD has been linked to the BSE epidemic in\ncattle, and34 people in Britain\nhave died in the past few years.\nThe research, published in The Lancet on15 January, Photo: UCSF\ntested for the presence of the particular prion which causes nvC JD in\nimmune system tissues such as tonsils.\nDue to the nature of the prion, the tests\nBy Gareth Morgan\nwere carried out in Level 3 Biohazard\nconditions; only one stage down from\nthose used to handle pathogens such as\nthe Ebola virus. Seven of the 68 tonsil\nNormal Conformer Rogue Conformer ,\n(speculative) ,\nhave since died, three of whom were confirmed as suffering from nvC JD. Other\nprion proteins were not detected. The success of the test opens the possibility\nfor pre-death testing of suspected nvC JD cases. It could also be used in a screening programme to determine the extent\nof the disease, but since there is no cure, this is\nunlikely to go ahead| One possible problem:;\" posed by the research is that\nthe prion protein, which is\nresistant to normal sterilis a^ tion procedures, could corns ' amin ate surgical instruments\nf during routine operations. II\nis possible that disposable surgical instruments could become standard in many procedures.\nProf Collin ge has said\nlh at the next goal is to find a non-invasive test for the dis-A normal prion and the defective version ease, ideally using a blood sample. Unfortunately, the\nsamples tested (including controls from question of whether Britain is poised on routine tonsil operations), were shown to the brink of an epidemic of nvC JD contain the prion. Of these patients, four remains unanswered.

When you meet\npeople and the talk turns to music,\nyou realise that when you say you like\nto listen to music that rocks with attitude and guitars that resonate with\nex hill a ration, people just think, ' Oh right, you mean, boring indie shite.' On dark and lonely nights in Linstead, I 've\nlain awake and contemplated a change in my music lifestyle -1 could listen to\ndance music instead. It's fresh. It's innovative. It (sometimes) isn't repetitive ly boring and uninspiring and if I listened\nto it long enough I might even find\nmyself actually dancing in the Union next to the lovely women of Imperial\ninstead of wandering round and occassionally spilling my drink. Dance music.\nIt's the way forward. I'm gonna go for it!\nYeah, right. And I guess the Pope\nsmokes dope at Lent! Toasted is a collection of unknown artists from Beatw a x telling the public that the guitar\nscene can be inspiring and upl if ing. It's thirteen tracks of which ten or eleven are\nreally quite perfect pop songs songs\nabout love, cigarettes, break-ups and fuck-ups. Self-pity hasn't felt this good in\nages. My faith has been restored.\nIt'san absolute tragedy that I can't mention every single band on this compilation. Multiscreen's Big City Loser continually threatens to burst into a great big\not gy of distortion but pulls away from the\nbrink every time, resisting the urge and heightening the tension brilliant.\nSketty's Call Me In short circuits and breaks into an utterly unforgettable cho rus - essential listening, fan ce Riley's Genevieve bobs along with a jovial,\nfunky, drug gy Hammond riff-very cool.\nVeer's Another Astronaut melds intelligent guitar pop sensibilities with rising\nvocal deliveries - superb, free boy's Down\nWith You throws us a mix of Beach Boys'\nharmonies and run along rush-inducing\nrhythms - excellent.\nSo get yourself an indie pie before\nsome fat bastard scoffs what's left. Get\nit while it's got attitude. Get it while it's hot. Get it while it's exciting. Get it before\nyou get fed up. Get it while you can. Come on kids, treat yourselves. Get Toasted EH\nDennis.\nGOOBER PATROL\nThe Unbearable Lightness Of Being Drunk\nThese guys are signed to the Fat\nWreck label which means that\nthose who actually care about west coast punk will already have an idea of what this will be like. Everyone\nelse probably won't have a clue and probably won't be that interested either. As is usual for virtually every\nband on Fat Wreck, Goober Patrol have\ntaken more than a slight influence from NOFX - which isn't that s uprising considering that Fat Mike both runs the label and plays in NOFX. He even man ages to turn up in the liner notes.\nAnyway, on to the album itself. As I said, this is west coast punk. Forget about\nGreen Day, Rancid and Offspring this\nisn'tone of your over poppy attempts.\nThis is punk the way it's meant to be played, kind of. You see the album starts\noff less than stupendously. The songs themselves are good. However, the speed of the music at first is at a dannon ying the rhythm isn't right for\ndancing nor is it fast enough for mosh-ing. It manages to fall between the two with a disturbing tendency for the first\nhalf of the album. The main cause of this\nis bad production. Punk is meant to be\nsloppily produced but when the album reaches the song High Times, the bass\nwinds up in the right place in the mix and\nyou realise that this is what was wrong. For the rest of the album all is well - the band manage to alternate well between fast and slower sections. However, the first half of this album appears worse in\nthis light, although this may well be solved in a live situation which is always\nthe best place to experience this style of\nmusic.\nThe songs themselves tend to have\na political slant most of the time. Although the band do write a couple of songs on drinking: 1000th Beer and the\ntitle track. The odd thing about these\nsongs is that for once a band has written\nabout alcohol and managed to appear\nwithout strong views on the to drink or\nnot to drink subject - quite a rarity really.\nThe last song on the album,/ Forget\nYour Name, is probably the strongest.\nThe band get upset with 'trendy' bands,\nwhich is slightly ironic considering that\nthey are a generic band on a label that\ncaters for almost exclusively one sound. All in all this would be a good album if it wasn't for a dod gy production job. The band do deserve congratulations\non a good title though, H Jamie\n25 January 1999\nSingles\nMuse - Muscle Museum EP\nAfter a great introduction of classical\nguitars playing Godfather music, the distortion kicks in and a protege of Thorn\nYorke enters creating the sound of Radiohead5 years ago. Still good, though. Desert Eagle Discs - The Lovers\nThis is a hip-hop song full of the exciting new sounds coming from this side\nof the Atlantic, The relaxed Bristolian\nbeats mix effortlessly with the yearning\nplea of \"Why can't we be lovers?' but the\ninevitable rap finds Its way in, between the choruses. Serum - Know How\nThis band is basically a load of annoying\nAmerican college kids doing their best\nto rip-off Green Day. You're left with the\nfeeling that this is what Hanson will\nsound like when that little drummer's plums drop. FatBoy Slim - Praise You\nWell, you probably know this song, given\nthat it's been at number1 recently. 'Bro-ken record' is not a term that you' d want applied to your song, but Praise\nYou with Its repetitive sampling of the\n*&\u00a3 \\ \u00a5\nend of the word 'should', sounds just\nlike one. Of course, those of you who\nhave been raving about FatBoy Slim this\npast year will think It's a piece of Inspired\ngenius.\nLittle Mothers - Your Twisted Sister\nFusing the stoned trip-hop of Massive\nAttack, the psychedelic drip py beats of\nPrimal Scream and some down-to-earth\nvocals from the Jeff Buckley school of\nsinging.

    "content": "25 January 1999 Arts 19\nEtcetera Theatre\nL ove's Labours Lost is by no means the greatest of Shakespeare's plays.\nSome of the characters are almost\ndress rehearsals for future couples in\nhis later works. The acting is certainly\ngood. This is rather fortunate, as there is\nvery little else for the performance to rely\non. The set consists of a few strategically\nplaced pieces of green-painted card-board, and the costumes and lighting are\ndefinitely minimalist. The cast is rather\nsmall, and there are more characters\nthan actors; if you can get over the fact\nthat some of the actors appear to be\nschizophrenic (because they occasionally\ncome on in different costumes with different accents), you should be just fine.\nThe action takes place in 1920s Bloomsbury society (a modernisation that works moderately well), with mis-guided noblemen dedicated to intellectual pursuits abstaining from womankind only to have their plans thwarted by\nresourceful females.\nThere are the usual benefits of fringe\ntheatre productions situated above a pub in that you can take your drinks into\nthe auditorium; only the very cramped seating conditions mean that you will\nprobably end up sitting on top of your\nneighbour and spilling your glass (to\nsome of you, this may sound like an\nideal night out!). Most comic moments lie with the obscure Spaniard who wanders on and off stage, and can do ama zing things with his left eyebrow. This\nspirited comedy is worth a visit, but this\nisn't going to change your life.\nAnna\nUntil 31st January\nNearest tube: Camden Town Tickets: \u00a37, concessions \u00a35\nPerformance times: Tuesday - Saturday\n7 pm, Sunday 6 pmT he Almeida Theatre Company continues its exciting season with this\nstaging of Vassa by Maxim Gorky, a piece rarely seen in Britain. The play is set\nin a provincial Russian townhouse, owned by a typical family belonging to\nthe new commercial class, where the\" houses are made of stone - and the people of iron\". The central character of the story is Vassa, the mother of the family. She is the head of the household,\nsince her husband is bed-ridden, and runs their 30-year-old business. She orders everyone around like a tyrant:\nher two sons-are both afflicted by handicaps. Pavel, the youngest is a cripple that\neveryone, including his beautiful wife\nLyudmilla, mocks. Semyon, the eldest\ncan't express himself properly because\nhe is so scared of his mother. His wife,\nNatalya, is a brilliant creation - a woman who believes in her values so blindly\nthat it is funny. A few other characters\nlive in the house too - Vassa's brother-in-law Prokhor, Lyudmilla's father and a few servants who spend all their time\neavesdropping.\nThe story begins to unfold completely when Vassa's daughter Anna appears. She had been thrown out of the\nhouse about 10 years before and, on her\narrival, receives a very warm welcome. Everyone starts dancing around the house. Anna and Vassa decide to\nbecome allies and discover all the family' s deepest secrets and plans. We find\nout that Prokhor wants to withdraw his\ninvestment in the business and leave.\nEvery single person in the family Is\nunhappy and Anna's presence serves as\na catalyst to the whole situation. They all\nfeel encouraged to leave Vassa. The\nfather finally dies and the household breaks down when they realise that\nVassa inherits all the business. Her sons'\ndreams of going to Moscow with their\nown money collapse.\nThe story is a fascinating attack on materialistic values and their influence on families. Gorky takes pleasure in showing the worst in human beings. Vassa has\nabsolutely no sympathy for her children.\nShe is an extremely strong woman, helped by her daughter. Vassa's tragedy\nis that she is fighting for her family, but\nat the same time against them. Whatever\nshe does, she comes across as a heartless matriarch who is obsessed only with\npersonal interests.\nThe play is very well staged with\nonly one decor throughout the three\nacts, the actors are perfect. Sheila Hancock makes an intense Vassa, David Tennant's Pavel is profoundly determined and the others artists play their parts\nsplendidly. Vassa and Anna create a wonderful duo, carrying most of the perform ance on their shoulders. Howard Davies does a great job of directing the\nenergy of these two women. I his is theatre at its most entertaining.\nD.

In a quest to secure ultimate victory for their team, students from\nBMS, St Mary's and the Cross performed a variety of increasingly bizzar e( and hugely entertaining games), largely based\naround the twin Rag themes of nudity\nand drinking.\nA close-run contest thus saw Mary's victorious in the Tub thumping___ \u201e\nChallenge( downing vodka, lager, cider and whiskey) and downing a pint of God-knows\nwhat( which appeared to include an entire fish), whilst\nCharing Cross notched up full\npoints in the Kebab contest (and\nthus retained the cup) and the nude yard downing. Not to be outdone, two talented first years\nfrom the BMS sc or red an imp res By David Roberts\nsive victory in the parsnip game( covering\na parsnip with lipstick with your hands tied\nbehind your back...you had to be there).\nHowever, the toughest game of the evening the egg race - produced a three-way draw, with none of the com pct it or s managing to circumnavigate the\nReynolds' bar with their boiled eggs in\ntact. Whilst this might seem simple, the\nfact that the eggs are inserted in your\nboxer shorts and every girl in the room is\nunder orders to break them makes this a very very dangerous event.\nThe final result saw Charing Cross\ncome from behind to score a victory,\nand notch up a victory in the drinking contest whilst the scores were being counted. Tuesday night saw Rag revues at\nboth Charing Cross and St Mary's. Both\nwere packed out and regarded as hilarious by all those present. Wednesday saw\nthe first big fundraising event,\nwith the Invasion of London\nlaunched from every campus,\nand securing a big pile of cash\nfor this year's charity, the British Heart found at ii on. The final two elements of\nRag Week the Circle Line Pub\nCrawl and the Rag Ball - took\nplace after Felix went to press,\nso look out for a full report in\nnext week's edition.\nSedrick: Safe No Longer\nBy Ed Sexton\nCity and Guilds Union mascot, Sedrick\nSafe, has been stolen by the Royal College\nof Science Union. The mascot was taken\nsometime during the weekend of1617 January, and is currently being held\nsecurely at an undisclosed location.\nC& GU declared the safe to be their\nviolate mascot, meaning that it can be\nstolen without fear of prosecution, earlier\non t fH.; term. The decision was allegedly\ntaken in the hope that C& GU would rid\nitself of the safe, an aspiration which would seem to have been fulfilled. Apparently it would have cost C& GU around fifty\npounds to have the safe removed, as it\nweighs about half a tonne. Exactly how RCSU removed the safe is unknown, but\nit was raised upon blocks, making lifting\nit with a fork lift relatively easy.\nAt the time of writing RCSU had yet to\nopen the safe door, meaning that according to C& GU sources \"they have yet to get\nthe whole mascot\". With the decline of\nmascot ry in recent years what will happen\nnext is open to debate. C& GU could\nreclaim Sedrick by paying \u00a350 to RAG, or\nthey could decide to steal the safe back\noff the RCSU. Given their apparent desire\nto throw out the safe, they may simply forget about it, leaving RCSU with the task of\npicking the lock.\nLast Tuesday saw the start of International Week, where societies make use of the\nopportunity to recruit new members and heighten the awareness of their region.\nTwo countries were represented; the Greeks offered a selection of food whilst the\nKoreans distributed promotional CD ROMs. Photo: Brett\n\n"

Impressive or what? With our new shirts as well, we looked damn fine and played brilliantly. During the first half\nChunderbird and Keyhole did a great job\nof cheering us on so much so that we only conceded two goals. The first one was a really fluky deflection off the post\nand the second one was a lucky hit\nthrough the goalie's legs. Apart from this Alice had a storming game saving\nsome really impressive shots on goal.\nOne awesome save involved Alice scooping the ball off the ground and over the backline. The umpire wasn't too impressed by this tactic, but it was-n't until Alice actually grabbed the ball\nwith her hands in another save that he awarded a penalty flick. Alice took it all\nin her stride and her intimidating stance\ncaused the opposition to miss by miles.\nKing's came back strongly, and as they\napproached our goal, our defence moved aside like Moses parting the Red\nSea, giving the opposition a clear sight\nof goal.

We countered this with an amazing break, which we very nearly\nscored from.\nIn the2 nd half we started in high spirits and played even better, putting\nseveral passes together.

As the whistle blew to\nbegin the game, prc-match nerves were quickly quelled when the first goal went in from Justin Travis for the Silwoodians.\nThis enhanced the close-knit team spirit\nwhich has been the essence of the Silw ood team, and it wasn't long before\nthe second glorious Silwood goal went in, scored by Konrad Dolphin.\nAt thirty-five minutes into the game Silw ood had scored4,2 more coming from Milton Men don ca and again from\nJustin. Late pressure in the first half\nmeant that after Dave trench saved the ball off the line twice, the6 th s managed to pull one back. However, Howard Wilson managed to score a fifth\nbefore half time.\nAfter a relaxed half time by the Silw ood ian s, replenished by succulent oranges and bananas, it wasn't long before another goal was scored, this\ntime by the home team, pulling the score back to 2 - S. The Silwood team\nhadn't finished at the goal mouth how ever, and Milton scored another to bring\nthe score line to 2 - 6. The only hope for\nthe South Ken team at this stage, was to\ntry and score on the break, but they\ncouldn't break through the cast iron\ndefence maintained by the two fullbacks,\nRichie He the ring ton and Neil Holmes.\nLater in the second half Steve Edgington\nscot eda blistering goal, which flew past\nthe keeper, and Thomas Pope hoped to\nfinish off the opposition, but unfortunately Justin was seen to have fouled the\n6th s and caused the goal to be disallowed. With light fading the final whistle was blown with a score of72 in Silwoods\nfavour, and the after match drink went down smoother than manna from heaven. Many thanks to Rob and the6 th s at South Ken and Richy at Silwood\nfor organising the match, and we look\nforward to meeting again later in the seas on.

    "content": "8\nOpinion 25 January 1999\nMerger to Kill Medics Sport!\nKash Akhtar, Clubs & Societies Officer, ICSM\nOn Wednesday27 January the Imperial Medics Rugby team will play Newcastle in the English Students' Final at Banbury to see which team is the best in the country; not the best in London, not in the South, but in the whole of England. By\nreaching the final they are already deemed to be better than any other team in London, better than Loughborough, better than Brunei, and so\non. Just reaching the final is a momentous achievement which should be acknowledged. The medics have also been given a bye to the quarter finals\nof BLJSA, and have gained entry in the\nEuropean competition by virtue of winning the Premier League South, where they overcame such teams as Bath,\nBristol and the current national cham pions, Brunei.\nIam a footballer and not a big fan of rugby, but I take immense pride in\nthe achievements of the rugby boys as\nthey are representing our medical school, no, my medical school. They are attracting lots of plaudits and positive attention and are raising the profile of ICSM. Of course, other clubs arc\ndoing so too, but the attention is\nfocussed on the rugby at the moment. I intend to be at the match and hope as many people as possible will come along to offer their support, which should make for a brilliant day out. I especially hope the first years come along and join in, as this cup final will\nprobably be the first time that they get a good idea of what ICS M and being a medic is all about. I feel sorry\nfor them as they are a bit isolated from the rest of the Med school being down at South Ken. This, coupled with the fact that their new course is completely alien to everyone else, has resulted in\nthe strange situation of unfamiliarity.\nI hope that this will slowly become resolved because the intimacy and camaraderie of the medical school is\nits best feature, and my overriding memory so far.\nAlong with the camaraderie comes a collective pride in the achievements of others, and the English Students' Cup could be the first major sporting triumph of ICSM this academic year.\nMy biggest worry, however, is rather\nthan any forthcoming successes paving the way for even more next\nyear, that they may never be replicated again, this would only be due to\na lack of funding and resources. Minibuses are very important to med ical students, and can stir up passions in away few subjects can. Whereas minibuses were always sub sidi sed before the merger with IC, this will\nnot be the case as of Autumn1999. Under the new guidelines transport\nfor Leaguematches will only be sub sidi sed by up to 4 0 % , whilst transport\nfor training will not be sub sidi sed at all.\nThis would mean a charge of around If they were to take minibuses then the\npotential cost to each player would be\nabout \u00a3150 per season just to train\nwhich would put off most people. A loss of subsidy and other funding will\nresult in talented players being unable to play and in fewer training sessions of lower quality. Yes, this may mean that the students can play safely, but\npet ing with them academically. There\nmust be many good academics that\npass over IC to go to Oxford or Cambridge because their sporting instincts\ncannot be satisfied. Why not hand out\na bit more money and make IC the\nequal, and maybe better, of any university in the country. College deems it fit to blow over a hundred thousand pounds on pretty plants but only gives\n\u00a3716,000 for all student activities, both\nsporting and non sporting. \u00a3716,000\nfor 10,000 students is \u00a371.60 per student per year for all clubs and societies\nas well as for paying sabbaticals, staff\ncosts, cleaning, security and so on. This is just not enough. To provide one footballteam with one kit and3 football s alone costs \u00a343 per player,\nnot taking into account affiliation, travel, referees, coaching, training pitches, bibs, pumps, compulsory teas\nfor opposition and so on. I have ne ver been aware of major\nfunding problems for clubs and societies before the merger with IC and when they arise they will cause much resentment. Dave Ftellard said to me, \"the problem is not that you' re going to have it especially bad now, it's just\nthat you' ve always had it good in the\npast\". Be that as it may, everything is\nrelative. To my mind merging with IC\nwill result in medics' clubs and societies feeling hard done by and feeling resentment at the merger. Other IC\nstudents must realise that this resent-ment is not directed towards them in\nanyway as they like us are just mere pawns. IC clubs have had a bum deal\nfor a while and now it seems it is the\nturn of the medics. The rugby team is attracting plaudits in the national press and from every university in the country. They\nare seen as Imperial first and medics second and arc raising the profile of\nImperial in away that a million pyramidal teabag s( a product of IC\nresearch) could never do. Their success\nis in no small part due to their coach whose \u00a39,000 fees are paid for by a group of consultants. If it were not for\ntheir generosity then such success might not be possible. It is brilliant for\nthe students that they do this and at\nthe sametime a shame that the funding for this and for other sports docs not come from more direct bene fic i aries such as IC, and in turn ICU.\nPlease make sure you are there on\n27 January to see the National Cup\nfinal. You may never get another chance. \u00a360 for taking a minibus for training for will they be any good? They will still do a couple of hours. This charge would well, due to the spirit of the in dl vi du have to be borne by the clubs as fund- als, but I cannot believe that we would ing will not be given to cover it. This ever compete as one of the best two\nwould also apply to friendlies and tour teams in the country ever again. A matches, resulting in considerable similar degradation of all other teams charges being passed on to players, will occur with people being forced to\nwho already pay out for the 'privilege' compete at levels beneath their talent,\nof playing. It is also entirely conceivable that cerT ran sport subsidy for training is tain clubs will no longer be able to\nessential. It has been proposed by ICU afford to run due to financial pro b that minibuses could be sub sidi sed for lem s, which would be a terrible waste, sport s such as rugby, where special It is a shame that College docs training( such as sc rummaging) is not contribute more to student act iv i essential for safety. The rugby team, ties given the potential that lies within for example, train twice a week, every the student body. Imperial College week, for about twenty weeks; about could be renowned for its sporting forty sessions in all. That is what it achievements in away that Oxford takes to become national champions, and Cambridge arc, as well as com "
