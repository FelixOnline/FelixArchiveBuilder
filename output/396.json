You may find yourself attracting some\nmembers of the opposite sex. Especially about the 10th when the\nMoon tr in es Venus they may find your magnetism ir resist able. Anyhow, the main theme is work and this may prove time consuming .\nGEMINI II (22May22 Jun): The Sun and your planet Mercury\nare in your area of social life, entertainment, and love affairs. These will be the main attractions of the month.New friends and/ or associates will be entering into your life.

Around the 9th,14 th and 19th good aspects from the\nMoon indicate you may gain prestige or respect over others. Or\nyour work may become easier. New developments may occur in\nyour love life. Venus will make you more attractive to others\nespecially around 8th and 1 0th and you are likely to meet many\npossible dates or make new friends.\nLEO ( 2 4 Jul23 Aug): The Sun and Mercury are both in your\narea of intellectual activities, communication (meetings, conferences, mail, phone), short journeys, relatives and neighbours.\nThese will play an important role until the 24th. Around the 9th their cOT i fOrt^ tion indicates a highly fortunate day in these areas.\nThe 13th may prove difficult if you follow impulses.

From the\n17th Mars may activate partnerships and friendships or further\nthem.\nLIBRA (24Sep230 ct): Jupiter is in your house of partnerships,\nformalities and public relations,. These will almost flow on the\n9th and 19th due to good aspects. The 13th may prove difficult in\nthese areas.

SCORPIO ( 2 4 0 ct22 Nov): While Venus enhances your hopes,\nwishes and brings harmonious relationships with friends particularly\non the 10th and 2 1 st, Jupiter protects your health and work.

You may find yourself involved with superiors\nin relation to career considerations. If not, it may be that you are\nconcerned about your future career.

AQUARIUS ( 2 1 Jan19 Feb): Owing to Uranus square Saturn\ncertain difficulties may arise in partnerships and this could lower\nyour prestige unless you employ some diplomacy.

A mighty force of levity, wit, gentlemanly aggression\nand civilised warfare has sprung from Albion' s Lions in the\nAntipodean regions of the British Empire, at the express command\nof that arch-enemy of gravity, darkness and despond an cy. The\nWizard of The Antipodes. This force of ' Light and Might' is\nknown to all the world as Alf' s Imperial Army, a name which\nalready strikes terror into the\ndark recesses of the self-hating, corrupting and un Br l tish Influences of\nseriousness. The Army' s patron\nand Warlord Is non-other than\nHis Levity, The Wizard\nHimself. So far units of Alf' s Army\nhave scourged and cleansed\nthe campuses of the University\nof Melbourne and the University\nof Canterbury (for the Ignorant,\nin Chrlstchurch New Zealand),\neliminating and thoroughly\ncrushing the Republican rabble\ninfesting those hallowed halls. From these bases repeated\npitched battles have been\nfought against the forces of\ngravity and depravity. Latrobe\nUniversity has been smashed,\nthe hairy barbarians of the far\nSouth of Otago are routed and\nconverted to the true faith.\nPreparations for the Invasion\nof the North Island of New\nZealand are now underway,\nwith plans projected for the\nre-invasion of Australia. Tremendous victories have\nbeen won but now a darker and\nmore forbidding task, one which holds great promise for the\n'Levity Loving People's of the\nWorld\", stands before us.I refer to the overthrow of the\nTyranny of Despair and\nGravity within the British\nIsles themselves.\nFor this sacred task two\nhighly trained henchmen of\nThe Wizard are even now,\nplotting within these Islands.\nThey are General Direction, Glorious Commander Alf' s Imperial Army, Pedes Division, already known to you by the\nalias of Derek Banks, posing\nas ex-student, scientist, part-time teacher, part-time drop-out\n(but .in fact a dedicated drop-in),\nsorcerer's apprentice and\nLev national Genera list. The\nother recently arrived minion\nof Antipodean necromancy Is\nnon other than Colonel Catford,\nglorious Commander of Alf' s Imperial Army, Eastern Antipodes Division and known\nto his \" friends\" as Tony\nCatford, sometime salesman,\nlabourer, cook, dishwasher,\nmountaineer and scoutmaster,\nhe poses as a bungling\nim com pet ant daydreamer whilst\nhatching out the most brilliant\nschemes ever dev l sed to destroy The-World-As-We-Know-lt.\nThese two half-wits have\nnow combined to throw their\nwhole wit Into Imperial College\nand establish a unit of Alf' s Imperial Army, cleanse the\ncampus, undermine Londo'n from within, and overthrow the\nRepublican - usurpers of Her\nMajesty's Government. At the\nmoment when the British peoples'\nare most convulsed with\nlaughter and mirth, they plan to\nlaunch a war against the Rebel\nAmerican Colonists, Install\nRichard Nixon as the new\nGovernor-General of the\nAmerican Colonies, Spike\nMllligan as the Governor of the\nSouth Island of New Zealand\nand then to rebuild the British Empire and more, armed with\nplastic swords, flour,water and\nImagination. Their sole excuse\nIs that every other option Is\npositively boring.\nAll this is a mere side show\ncompared with The Wizard and\nhis plans for his First Advent\nUpon Tower Hill. The first\nattempt to appear there out of\nnothing will be made in the\ncoming months!\nBeware the People's Republic of Oxford Street and\ntheir lackeys and running dogs!\nConfound their politics.\nFrustrate their knavish tricks;\nOn thee our hopes we fix:\nGod save the Ou een.^ They're students Prof!

    "content": "i President to eat\nin Southside!\nPeter Teague, IC Union President, will force himself to eat in the Southside refectory\nat least once a week from now on. He is taking this drastic step in order that he can\nmonitor the quality of food being served their. This came out at the UGM yesterday when\nhe was proposing the refectories motion printed in Monday's issue of FELIX. A home for R CSU At long last the Royal College of Science Union has\nan office it can call its own .\nUp until now the R CSU Office\nwas in the room above Southside Shop belonging to the\nSummer Accommodation Service.\nThis meant that the office had\nto be evacuated of all traces of\nRCS every summer term. But now, with the opening\nof the New Huxley Building, things have changed for the\nbetter. The new, purpose-built\noffice, situated at the west\nend of the Sherfield walkway,\ncomprises a small executive\noffice for administrative purposes\nand a larger meeting room\nwhich has been equipped with\nplush, new chairs. The one\nmajor drawback of the new\noffice was neatly summed up by\nVice President Chalky White:\n\"There's no bloody windows\" .\nDamp but\nsuccessful\nFair75 Large crowds attended this\nyear's Freshers Fair which\nwas held last Tuesday after-noon. This is tbe second year\nrunning that the Fair has been\nheld in the Union Building \u2014\npreviously, the Fair was held\nin the JCR, Sherfield Building.\nOver ninety clubs and\nsocieties were present at the\nFair to try and convince the\nhordes to join their particular\nclub or society. However, the\nadvice given to the fresher s at\nthe Freshers Reception on\nWednesday made Freshers\ncautious in parting with any\nmonies 1\nThe bar staff worked\nextremely hard to provide\nliquid sustenance for the\nhundreds of people who come\nto the Fair! Brendan, the\nUnion Bar manager said that\nhis staff, full and part-time\ncould only be commended for\ntheir efforts and the unusually\nlong hours they worked.\nMany experienced Fair goers\nthought that tb is year's was\nquite successful and it certainly\nattracted more people than it\nhas done in tbe past few years.\nThere were two amendments\nto the motion which was finally passed by an overwhelming\nmajority. Both amendments\nwere to the section\" IC union notes\". The words\nafter refectories in p dint four of\nthe section were deleted and\na seventh point added. This noted that the government's canteens in Westminster were\nheavily subsidized. It was brought out at the\nmeeting that the refectories\nhad made a total loss of \u00a344000\nwhen the catering reserves had\nbeen taken into account. It has\nbeen decided to pay off this\ndebt over a period of three to four years.\nThe catering system in the\nCollege had not been reviewed\nAt the fresher s' reception\nlast Monday, the Rector, the\nIC Union President and several other officers of the\nUnion delivered speeches to\nthe UG and PG fresh men and\nwomen dealing with all aspects\nof College and Union affairs .\nThe main theme of the\nspeeches was participation'\nand involvement in the College and Union act i\\ \u00abi ties. In ' his speech, the Rector impressed\nupon students the importance\nof \"an active and involved\nUnion\" in College life and the\nneed to give it \"our utmost\nsupport\" in order to make it\n\"truly representative of the\nstudents of this College\".\nfor 10 years and the President\ndid not feel that this was\ngood enough considering the '\nadvances that had been made\nin this field in this period. What was required was an independent body to investigate\nthe College's catering system. This body would report its findings to the Refectory\nCommittee and this report\nwould also be published in FELIX. It was quite clear that\nmany people agreed with the\nmotion although some of them\nappeared not to fully understand\nits aims. This led to a lot of\nconfusion and time wasting in the meeting.\nThere then followed attempts\nto discuss a motion proposed\nWe have enjoyed massive\nredevelopment in the last\ntwenty years...\", he said. However, the cash shortage\nfacing universities would delay\nplans to increase undergraduate\nstudent numbers. Also, there\nwere fewer women in the\nCollege much to everyone's sorrow and strenuous efforts to\ndeal with this problem were in hand.\nHe also went to talk about\nthe refectory price increases\nand the College's position\nwith respect to the UGC' s self-balancing rules. There\nwas very little the College\ncould do about the problem,\nbut they were looking into\nby Pete Holland who was not\nat the meeting. This attempt\nfinally failed when the quorum\nwas challenged by Tom Abraham successfully. It was also revealed that\nJohn Downs, Honorary Secretary\nof IC Union, had not in fact\ngot glandular fever but was suffering from a disease\nsuspected to be German\nmeasles. Although he would\nprobably be out of the sick bay in a few days he will be\nunable to resume his duties for\nanother three or four weeks. In\nthe meantime, the President\nand Deputy President will handle any urgent matters that\nJohn would have had to deal\nwith. ways of running refectories\nmore economically. Peter Teague speaking later\nat the reception outlined the\nissues which would be facing\nstudents in the Union this\nyear. Accommodation was one\nof these. \"We have got about\n1200 students in College\naccommodation \u2014 that is not\nenough... I do not feel we\nshould be satisfied until we\nhave every student who wants\nto go into College accommodation in College accommodation\".\nOn the question of refectories,\nthe President said,\" I feel\nthe Union should be pressing\nContinued on bach page\nFreshers' ReceptionParticipation and caution\n\n"

    "content": "CFOOD GUIDE\nMany of you will, by now, have had occ as sion to sample some\nof the delights of Mr Mooney's kitchens. This being the case,\nseveral points may have struck you regarding the quality of food,\nservice and hygiene ot the refectories. We do not propose to go\ninto these matters here .\nFor those of you who are\nparticular about the food you\neat, we have compiled a list\nof restaurants in this guide\nwhere one can obtain meals at\nreasonable prices.\nThe list has been roughly\ndivided into three sections\naccording to price. The first\nconsists of those restaurants\nwhich serve similar meals to\nthose in College refectories,\nbut of a much better quality .In\nthe second, restaurants which offer a slightly wider range of\nchoice in dishes and of a higher price are listed . These\nare the sort of places worth\nvisiting at weekends with friends.\nThe third and last area\nincludes restaurants only to\nbe visited on rare and special ccc as s ions. This is an alternative eating\nguide and should be used as such. It provides you with a wide range of restaurants with\nmatching prices. Good eating!\nCheapies\nThese purveyors of fine food are on the whole, for the\nmain course, slightly dearer (but only be a few pence \u2014\ndon't forget they have waitress service) than Mooney's refectories. They offer a wide selection of dishes (main\ncourse 3Op \u2014 50p). However, their deserts (which are not\nobligatory, but nevertheless recommended) are rather more\nexpensive (15p \u2014 20p) than those in Southside.\nThese establishments are to be regarded as Mooney's rivals \u2014 their prices reflect the high turnover of satisfied\ncustomers and hence their inexpensive ness with no loss to\nservice .\nShould you live near, in or are visiting Kangaroo Valley\n(Earls Court to Barry McKenzie) then one of \" Pot\" restaurants\nis where you are most likely to eat. The recommended one\nis the 'Hot Pot' in Kenway Road'. Here you can obtain\ndelicious Mousaka for 50p or succulent Roast Chicken for\n45p and even good Spag. Bol.( Spaghetti Bolognese to the\nuninitiated) for 35p. If this den of iniquity doesn't grab you,\nthen try the 'Chelsea Kitchen' on Kings Road or the 'Stockpot'\nin Basil Street.

There are a large number of establishments, varying\nwidely in appeal, which cater for this'. You can also be\nserved by 'Butch Boys', 'Leggy Beauties' or even have\ndecent food at Strikes, GAS and GAD respectively'.\nAlbert's Plum offers loud music, large portions, titillating\nwaitresses and its proximity to College. There is also a disco in the evenings which is worth a visit if only to\nexperience a Harvey Wall b anger.' On the other hand, if its 6.00am. and you're tired, hungry\nand have lots of loose change, then GAS is the place for\nyou. Here, the waitresses, showing practically all that\nnature gave them, are the main attraction'.The food however,\ndoes not quite match up to expectations.\nIf however, what you require is good food at reasonable\nprices, there is only one disaster area to go to \u2014 GAD .\nEverything on the menu is well cooked and the range\nstretches past hamburgers. One can quench one's thirst\nwith the iced water provided or indulge in a fruit-flavoured\nmilkshake (at 35p the best to be had anywhere in town). At\n71pa plain hamburger,and chins served with lots of chilli\nsauce is very good value indeed'. Their barbecued spare\nribs (\u00a31 50) is a memorable feast which can be topped \u2014 off\nwith a portion of chocolate fudge cake (40p)'.

In the odd occasions\nwhen a few of you want something different (not women! \u2014\nor men!?!), it is worth trying one of the restaurants in this\ngroup'. You can explore several varieties of curries in the\n'Curry Palace' in Gloucester Road.

    "content": "FELIX\nSECURITY NEWS\nThe attention of Students, particularly new arrivals to the\nCollege, is drawn to the services provided by the security staff\nand they should not hesitate to contact the Security Officer,\nRoom 163 Sherfield Building, internal no: 2741 regarding any\nmatter concerning security and in particular any of the following\nmatters:-Lost Property\nDuring the course of a year hundreds of items of personal\nproperty are found and handed into the security office \u00ab \u00ab much\nof it never claimed by the losers. Students and staff who lose\nItems of property should promptly report them to the security officer\nand in many cases a speedy restoration will result. Similarly, persons finding such items of property should promptly hand them\nto one of the messengers or security staff.\n\"it is pertinent to mention that on the first day of the new\nsession two wallets containing a total ot\u00a3210 together with handbags and other Items were handed into the Security Office and\nrestored to the losers\" .\nThefts\nAs to be expected, in institutions of this kind which allow\nsuch freedom of access periodical spates of stealing occur\nand students are asked not to leave their valuables lying around in\ndrawing offices, laboratories etc. The stealing of wallets from\nclothing and purses from handbags are the most common types of\noffences and these items should be either carried on the person at\nall times or locked away when not required. Pedal cycles are\nanother target for thieves and when these are brought on to the\ncampus they should be secured to the cycle racks by means of a stout chain and heavy padlock. The use of plastic covered cables with patent locks as sold by many dealers, are totally in ad equate for this purpose and a number of cycles which had been\nsecured by this means have been stolen, above all, if you value\nyour cycle insure it.\nCar Parking\nUnless you have been authorised to park your car on the\ncampus*; please do not bring it into the college car park otherwise\nyou are likely to cause considerable inconvenience to some\nperson who has a parking space. Derelict vehicles also are from\ntime to time a source of embarrassment to the College and any\nvehicle which has ceased to be roadworthy should not be left on\nthe car park where it may quickly become cannibal is ed. Motor\ncycles should be registered in the security office and parked only\nin the special places allotted .Parking them in the spaces between\nmotor cars can result in damage being caused to both motor cycles\nand cars. Student\nCounselling\nService\nWHAT? WHO?\nWHERE? WHEN? HOW?\nThe Student Counselling Service is\navailable to any student who is encount'ering problems of a social, domestic,\npersonal or other nature .\nIf the Counsellor cannot help directly, ha\nmay nevertheless be able to suggest\nsomeone who can. Mr Don Adlington The Health Department, 14 Prince's Gardens. The Student Counselling Service is, however, Independent of the\nadministration and the academic staff,\nand is strictly confidential. Mondays to Fridays, between 10 0 0 and\n17 0 0 hours, preferably by appointment.\nIf there Is some urgency, however, Mr\nAdlington will see students on any given\nday without appointment - though this\nmay entail a short wait. Appointments may be made by telephoning\nInternal No.4205, or through the main\nCollege switchboard (ext. 1893), direct\nto Mr Adlington; or through the Health\nDepartment receptionist (Internal No.4271); or by calling In at the Health\nDepartment.\nInternational Socialists\nwho are we?\nThe International Socialists are the largest revolutionary\nsocialist organisation in Britain. At Imperial College there is a\" workplace branch\" which has the main perspective of building\na strong socialist presence within the trade unions on campus. Current members of the branch are all active members of the\nCollege based trade unions N UP E and ASTM S and are committed\nto fighting for militant policies on wages and conditions, and for\nextending democracy to achieve rank and file control.\nStudents are encouraged to\njoin or work with IS members,\nand in the past undergraduate\nmembers have committed them-sl eves to the main trade union\nwork. An IS society was formed\nlast year, membership of which\nis open to IS student members,\nand also to those supporters\nwho read our weekly paper\nSocialist Worker and Identify\nwith IS politics. To date the\nIS Soc. has concentrated on\nInternational Issues and played\na leading part In last years\ncampaign against the National\nFront's intrusion onto the\ncampus . This year, if sufficient\nstudents are Interested, the\nsociety will also play a Vigorous part in Student Union\npolitics . The problems facing\nstudents \u2014 cut backs in public\nexpenditure, higher staffing\nratios, the closure of Colleges of Education etc. \u2014 form just a part of the Government's attack on living standards. The\nfight against the cuts at IC\nmust be an integral part of the\ncampaign which we are working\nto build among the rank and\nfile of the British Labour\nmovement .\nOverseas Students\nThe IS branch has forged\nstrong links with many of the\noverseas students at IC. The\ncontinued domination of third\nworld countries has an important\ntechnological aspect and moves\nto counteract this within the\nCollege should be part of the\npolitical activities of overseas\nstudents in particular .Overseas\nstudents are welcome to work\ndirectly with IS and gain\nexperience of British politics which are directly those of an\nadvanced industrial society. However, in cases where\nstudents wish to make their\ninvolvement informal, or even\nanonymous we recognise the\nseriousness of their positions.

    "content": "mix7 IC WATER POLO TOUR75 By Andy Smith\nIn the early hours of Saturday, June 14th( well, about 10.30am), IC Water Polo Club said goodbye to the easy life and once again\nwent West, (ie we went I ast year as well). The advance party\ncomprised Paul Hindle, Cliff Spooner, Jim Williams, Kosta Ribar,\nMark Taylor and Andy Smith while the seventh member Sniffy was\nr ecru kea on the way down.\nTr We was to be no respite\nand just an hour after reaching\nLymington we were in the\nwater and playing the first\nmatch. This was In the open\nair sea water pool on the front\nand against an enthusiastic\nLymington side. However, with\nsterling work from Jim in\nde le nee and goals from Andy\n(4), Kosta(2) and Cliff(2) we\nmanaged to scrape an 8\u20146 win. This was despite the referee\nbeing completely unimpressed\nby Bluebottle's dives of Rodney\nMarsh vintage.\nWe then carried on to take\nup residence in our first class accommodation \u2014 two caravans\nat Osmington Mills near\nWeymouth. Excellent food was\nsupplied by our catering\nmanager Spooner (if you were\nin the right caravan) although\nthe curry nearly proved too\nmuch fa Ji m.Any further\nrequirements were amply\ncatered fa at the nearby\nSmugglers Inn.\nThe next match was against\nBournemouth on Tuesday\nevening (and indoors) by which\ntime Paul Hindle,and Kosta had\nreturned, as planned,to London\nto be replaced by Ray Lewis, Ian Bales and Paul Frieze. We\ngot off to a bad start with the\ndefence looking very jittery,\nbut Cliff was determined to\nenjoy himself which several\nof the opposition found out to\ntheir cost! So although I thought we'd lost (well, there\nwere a lot of goals to add up),\nit turned out we'd won 11-10 \u2014\ngoals coming from Cliff, Paul, Rory and Andy. Much needed\nrefreshments were then supplied\nIn the local fire station where\nthe Bournemouth secretary was\nactually on duty.\nThe third match was the\none we were all looking\nforward to, especially those\nof us who'd been the year\nbe fa e. The match was in the\nriver at B rid pat in the early\nevening on Thursday. However\nour two biggest worries, the\ntemperature of the water and\nthe sewage had improved from\nthe last occassion,s o there\nwere' no serious casualties \u2014\nthough Mark and Paul might\ndisagree as they were still shiver hg after several whiskies.\nIan Bales did a grand job\nplaying in goal, a position\nwhere you can't swim around\nto keep warm. As fa the\nmatch itself, we won that 7 - 3\nIn front of an appreciative\ncrowd of well over 30 people.\nThe final match was a return game against Lymington\non our way home. This turned\nout to be an easy match as they\nwere without the services of\ntwo of the-ir better players, and\nwe strolled in faa62 victory. Un fatu nat ely we then\nagreed to play an extra quarter\nand my sunburn blisters finally\nsubmitted to external pressure\nand burst \u2014 the Friday had been\na glorious day and had been\ntaken full advantage of on\nWeymouth beach,\nSo thanks must go to Cliff and Jim fa supplying the\ntrans pat, and Paul Hindle and\nMark faa gan ising the raffle\nwhich supplied the life giving\nfunds.\nPolo Club meets every Monday\nand Friday at the pool at 7pm, to which all are welcome. So\ndon't miss this fine opportunity\nto increase the quality of your\nexistence. A holiday (sorry I mean, tour) in the West\nFinally, the Swimming and Country could be yours !\nIC GLIDING CLUB RISES TO GREAT HEIGHTS By Nigel Leak\nThe Gliding Club's highly successful year has progressed to\neven greater heights with the achievement of four ' Gold' height\nflights during the last two weeks in September.\nA group of members took the Club's Dart, skylark and syr idi cate Dart up to Aboyne, in the highlands of Scotland in search of the\nlee waves shed by the mountain ranges in westerly winds. Although the weather was not always kind, much.flying was.done\nand four members, two of them students, achieved height gains\nqualifying for half of the Gold\nbadge of the Federation\nAeronatique International. To achieve this, the pilot had to\ngain in excess of 3000m(9841 feet) In height after launch .The\ngreatest gain achieved was\nwhen Tony Pater( Maths III)\nmanaged to get the clubs Dart\nup to a height of 15,300 feet\nabove sea level after an initial\nlaunch of 3000 feet. Also qualifying was Nigel Leak\n(Aero III) who managed 12,900\nfeet hi the club Skylark. The\ndisappointment of the trip was\nwhen Mike L inch( Mech Eng\nIII) had to terminate his climb\nonly a couple of hundred feet\nfrom his goal to dive 8000 feet\nto get through a hole in the\ncloud so as not to loose sight\nOf the quickly disappearing\nground.\nThis soft of flying is very\n\u2022rewarding and for somebody\nwho hasn't done it, hard to\nimagine. All I can say is that\nto me, sitting in my cockpit,\nover two miles up, looking\ndown on nearly 2000 square\nmiles of Scotland, it was\ntruely incredible .\nFinally I would like to thank\nour ex-student members for\norganising the expedition,\nsupervising our flying and for\ntowing two of the gliders on the\n1200 miles round trip.\nStudent Welfare\nby Don Adlington, Student Counsellor\nThis session, Jaqui Gerrard (Acting Union Welfare Officer)\nand myself and, we hope, some other, interested students \u2014 are\nstarting a new service to students in the Student Welfare room on\nthe top floor of the Union Building. The room wi II be staffed \u2014 by\nstudents the other three days, from 12.30pm to 1.30pm every\nweekday of Term. We will have a supply of useful leaflets on a variety of subjects and these can be taken away freely fa your\nown use.\nBut the essence of the\nStudent Welfare Centre is that\nthere will be someone there\nwith whom you can discuss personally any difficulties you\nmay have, and who. may have\naccess to in f amati on, advisory\nservices and other sources of\nhe Ip which are not so obviously\navailable on demand. There is\na lot of evidence that many\nstudents experience anxiety\nrelating to essentially practical\nmatters. Fa example, quasi legal difficulties with land lads in respect of the terms of a tenancy agreement are very\ncommon, and a few minutes\ntalk may make it clear whether\nor not you need to see a Solicit a. Similarly contacts\nwith the Police a with the\nCourts can be very disturbing\n(especially so fa overseas\nstudents) and the Student\n\"Welfare Centre will try to put\nthings into context fa you,and,\nif necessary, put you in touch\nwith a Solicit a. Accommcdatjon\nand financial problems are\nprobably foremost among the\npractical difficulties affecting\nstudents now. In the Student\nWelfare Centre we will not have\nlists of accommodation a bundles of five-pound notes. What we will. have is the time\nto listen, and we may be able\nto suggest possible lines of\napproach which have not\noccurred to you. Of course many things which\nupset us are nothing like so\nstraight f award, and everybody-even the adequately housed and\nadequately financed - runs into\nmore personal difficulties every\nnow and again. It often does\nhelp to talk to a sympathetic\nlistener at such times, and we\nmight, of course, find it\nperfectly easy to talk to our\ntut a a super v lsa, a to a friend. But again there Is good\nreason to think that some\npeople cannot do this . If that is\nhow you see yourself, and you\nwould find it easier to talk to\nsomeone conf if jen ti ally through\na\" helping\" agency in your\nown Union Building, just call in.\nRUGBY TRIALS Imperial College RFC will hold trials at Harlington\non Sunday October 4th. Prospective players should\nmeet at 12.45pm in the\nUnion for departure by\ncoach. Only if you attend these\ntrials can we ensure the\nbest possible teams.\nA\"Pi e'n mash\" supper\nwill be held on our return to\nthe Union. So, for a good\ngame of Rugby and a sociable\nevening we look forward to\nseeing you on Saturday.\nIMPERIAL GAMES Sunday 26th October\nFirst event 1.50 pm\nWest London Stadium\n(near White City) Track and field events \u2014\nlots of silver cups etc.\nTransport provided from the\nUnion.
