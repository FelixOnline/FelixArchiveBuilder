    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFriday 30 November 2007 felix\nFilm\nGangster murders the competition\nRobin George Andrews\nWith the Hollywood hotshots Ridley, Russell and Denzel on board, does American Gangster stand out\nagainst the prestigious mobster pedigree before it? Well, it certainly doesn\u2019t give up without a fight\nThere are two sides to the American\nDream, apparently. Not quite understanding why the US has claims on a\nterm which could apply to anyone in\nthe world \u2013 in that you can achieve\nmonetary and social success through\nhard work and perseverance \u2013 I can\nclearly see that after watching Ridley\nScott\u2019s new film, there are two very different ways of achieving success.\nOne is represented by Denzel Washington\u2019s portrayal of Frank Lucas, a re-al-life heroin kingpin operating during\nthe closing days of the Vietnam War;\nthe other is conveyed through Russell\nCrowe\u2019s incarnation of Richie Roberts, the detective who brought down\nhis drug empire. An influential director and two Academy Award winning\nstars definitely sounds like a promising mix, so do this trio of Hollywood\u2019s\nfinest do justice to the near-legendary\ncrime saga? As Washington\u2019s character quotes quite rightly, \u201ceither you\u2019re\nsomebody, or you\u2019re nobody.\u201d So which\nis it to be for American Gangster?\nThe story itself is based on real life\nevents, and although I knew very little\nabout Frank Lucas and his New York\nheroin ring, everything on show here\nseemed believable enough. Not only\nthat, but it was utterly enthralling;\nto watch how a black man in 1960\u2019s\nAmerica overtakes the Mafia in the\ndrugs business with the truly ingenious method of smuggling in heroin\nfrom South-East Asia was, frankly,\nstunning.\nOn the other side is one of the few\nhonest cops left in the city (Crowe), a\ncop who we see ridiculed by officers\nand criminals alike early on for not taking one million dollars of bribe money.\nWith his marriage falling apart at the\nseams simultaneously, he decides it is\ntime to show New York what he is capable of.\nAs Frank Lucas rises to the top of his\ngame, parallels are drawn at every step\nwith the rise of Roberts\u2019 detective, and,\nalthough they rarely physically cross\npaths, you can feel just how close each\nAmerican Gangster \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nWriter: Steve Zaillian\nCast: Russell Crowe,\nDenzel Washington\nof them is to unlimited success \u2013 and\ncatastrophic failure.\nIn the mix are several large collectives of corrupt cops, tens of loyal family members of the Lucas household,\nmany hundreds of faithful civilians\nfrom Harlem, and thousands upon\nthousands of heroin addicts. This film\nis rated 18, not because of the violence content (although there are some\nshocking moments) but rather due to\nthe explicitness with which the drug\nabuse aspect is handled; every time\nsomeone is seen injecting Lucas\u2019 her-oin, alluringly known as \u201cBlue Magic\u201d\nwith all the panache and style of a designer brand, the after effects are quite\nclearly shown and are nothing short of\nnauseating.\nLucas\u2019 rise to the top is carefully\njuxtaposed against the effects of long-term heroin addiction, and, although\nyou cannot help but admire his ability to fulfil his ambitions and attain\nsuch power, to see him cutting into a\nThanksgiving turkey in his million dollar mansion whilst a baby cries over the\nlifeless remains of his blood-covered\nfather is sickening. Scott really underlines the idea that intelligence, hard-work, and persistence enable people\nto achieve both wonderful dreams and\nterrible nightmares.\nRoberts\u2019 determination to bring Lucas down is equally as captivating, and\nhis rough-and-ready but clearly intuitive character is instantly likeable. The\nfilm may be the story of the rise and fall\nof Frank Lucas, but my primary source\nof enjoyment was seeing just how this\nisolated detective was able to bring the\nenormous drug empire crashing to its\nknees.\nBoth of the leads, although rarely in\nthe same scenes, have a demanding\nscreen presence and their performances drive the film. This, however,\nisn\u2019t to say the supporting cast aren\u2019t\nup to scratch. The entire ensemble is\nmagnificent with both high standards\nin impeccable acting and genuine,\nthorough characterisation. This is the\nreal deal.\nThe climax of films based on real-life\nevents can often be quite, well, anticli-mactic, but American Gangster thankfully sidesteps this problem; a careful\nscript shows that a film can end as\ndramatically and as intriguingly with\narrests and words as it can with a spec-tacular, Departed-esque shoot-out.\nAlthough the beginning is a little\nslow, as soon as both of the lead roles\ncollide on their respective paths to individual glory everything kicks off, and\ndespite a hefty running time of 158\nminutes my patience was never once\ntested.\nThis film is most certainly some-thing, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the\ndirector in question was tipped to win\nBest Director at the Academy Awards.\nHere\u2019s to American Gangster, showing\nhow anyone can achieve anything if\nthey put there mind to it. And the consequences of the paths they take...\nLeft: Come to daddy! Right: I would have gone for the poppy, but they\u2019re all being used for the smack\nLeft: Russell Crowe on realising Denzel stole his Oscar way back in 2001. Right: Russell\u2019s salary demands getting somewhat ridiculous\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk Politics\ntioned the position of former president\nBill Clinton, who would become First\nGentleman if she were elected. Some\nare suggesting that he would become\nPresident-by-proxy. However Hillary\nRodham (to use her maiden name as\nshe often does) whose parents were\nfamously tough with her as a child\n\u2013 There is a story that Hillary came\nhome and complained about a bully at\nschool; her mother replied that there\nwas no room in the house for cowards\n\u2013 is unlikely to allow her husband or\nanyone else boss her around.\nBarack Obama, like Hillary has historic potential, as he could become\nthe first black president of the United\nStates. While Hillary Clinton has developed an Iron Lady image, Obama\nhas been labeled as a \u201crock star\u201d and\na \u201cbeach babe\u201d; hold on we are talking\nabout Presidential Candidates aren\u2019t\nwe? He has become a media darling\nand is certainly the candidate with the\nmost charisma. When he made his first\ntrip to the state of New Hampshire \u2013\none of the first to choose its candidate\nfor president \u2013 the governor joked that\nhe had booked Mr. Obama for an appearance because he would sell more\ntickets than the Rolling Stones. In addition he has been the only candidate\nto really keep up with Hillary Clinton.\nDespite being behind her in the polls,\nuntil recently he had consistently raised\nmore money than she or any other candidate had. In truth Barack Obama has\na hell of a lot going for him. His multicultural background and upbringing\nhas allowed him to claim a unique foreign policy viewpoint and as the only\nserious candidate to have explicitly\nopposed the war in Iraq he has been\nable to speak credibly about ending the\nwar in Iraq. Despite receiving criticism\nfor a perceived inability to dent Hillary\nClinton\u2019s campaign, the man whose\nname people always get wrong is whom\nI\u2019d like to see in the White House.\nYou\u2019ll notice that I\u2019ve left out a lot of\ncandidates. The two I\u2019ve mentioned\nare Democrat nominees and I haven\u2019t\nmentioned any Republican candidates.\nBy this I\u2019m implying that they are neither electable or that I don\u2019t believe\nthat they should be elected. In the\nDemocrat camp, the person in \u2018third\u2019\nplace is John Edwards. I don\u2019t personally believe that he is unsuitable for the\njob, rather that should he be elected as\nDemocrat nominee it will not be because he is the right person for job it\nwill be because the Democratic Party\nwas unable to stomach voting for a\nwoman or a black man. Obama and\nClinton are such strong candidates that\nthe only thing that would trip up their\ncampaign would be a personal scandal\nor the emergence of prejudice inside\nthe privacy of the voting booth.\nOn the republican side we have a\ncombination of persons who are unlikely to be elected and who should\nnot in my view be allowed to hold of-fice. Mitt Romney and John McCain\nare unelectable. John McCain because\nhe is a neo-conservative in a time when\nneo-conservatism has lost all credibility and Mitt Romney because he is at\nonce a weak candidate and a Mormon.\nThen we have Rudy Giuliani who certainly is electable but I hope that he\nisn\u2019t. I am amazed at how a man who\nhas so consistently lied about his political background and his 9/11 experience\nhas become the front-runner for the\nRepublican Party nomination. At the\nforefront of these lies is his warped account of his achievements as mayor of\nNew York and his claim that he spent as\nmuch time in the rubble at ground zero\nas rescue workers did. Strange then that\n9,000 ground zero workers are filing\na class action lawsuit against NYC for\nhealth-and-life-threatening conditions\nand injuries sustained in the pit while\nhe remains a picture of health. A candidate should start as they mean to go\non, god forbid what this means for the\nU.S.A if Rudy is elected President.\nAs students, we may get our kicks from\nbuying food reduced to clear at 2am in\nBig Sainsbury\u2019s, but frankly, there are\nmore important things out there in the\nwide universe. And here are just a few\nof them.\nAustralia gets a new prime\nminister\nAustralia elected a new Prime Minister last week in the form of former\ndiplomat Kevin Rudd. It ends 11 years\nof conservative rule lead by John\nHoward. Howard sent troops to the\ndeeply unpopular war in Iraq and has\naligned himself closely with US President George Bush. Rudd promises to\nkeep good relations with the world\nsuperpower, but will withdraw forces\nfrom the Middle East and intends to\nsign the Kyoto protocol.\nEthnic discrimination in Malaysia\nEthnic Indians took to the streets in\nKuala Lumpur in protest of the Malay\ndominated government\u2019s openly discriminatory laws. Police used tear gas\nand water cannons to quell outbursts\nof violence which erupted sporadically\namongst the 10,000 marchers. The\nHindu groups want a change to laws\nwhich prioritise ethnic Malays when it\ncomes to employment and university\nplaces. Malays represent around 60%\nof the population and have the lowest\nrates of academic achievement and\nincome. Indians make up 8% and Chinese approximately one fifth.\nBomb blast in Sri Lanka\nTwo bombs exploded within hours of\none another in the Sri Lankan capital\nof Colombo on Wednesday. 17 died\nin the attack in the on going civil war\nwhich has an estimated death toll of\n70,000 since hostilities began in the\n1970\u2019s. The Tamil Tiger organisation\nfights for an independent state in the\nnorthern part of the island. Their differences lie in language, access to education and religion - Sri Lanka\u2019s government is dominated by Buddhists,\nwhilst the Tigers are mainly Hindu.\nBlasphemy in Sudan\nA British teacher was arrested in Sudan after allegations of blasphemy. The\ncrime was committed in a classroom\nwhere she had encouraged the children\nto name a teddy bear after the Muslim\nprophet Mohammad. Foreign Secretary David Milliband was quickly on\nthe phone to the Sudanese ambassador in attempt to resolve the issue, and\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown said he\nwas \u2018very sorry\u2019 for Ms Gibbons.\nMusharraf officially a civillian\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, the leader\nof the south Asian country Pakistan\nsince a coup in 1999, has given up his\nmilitary uniform in a bid to legitimately win an election expected by January\n2008. He is one of America\u2019s most important allies in the \u2018War on Terror\u2019 as\na neighbour of Afghanistan, but is running into trouble over such close ties\ndomestically. General Ashfaq Kayani\nnow heads the military of the nuclear\narmed nation.\nBush\u2019s last chance\nGeorge Bush welcomed Israel\u2019s Prime\nMinister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian\nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas\nto Annapolis, USA for the start of a\nnew round of bilateral talks. Many see\nthis conference as the last chance for\nthe Bush administration to redeem itself on the international stage. \u201cIsrael\nmust demonstrate its support for the\ncreation of a prosperous and successful Palestinian state by removing unauthorized outposts, ending settlement\nexpansion, and finding other ways for\nthe Palestinian Authority to exercise\nit\u2019s responsibilities without compromising Israel\u2019s security\u201d the president\nsaid.\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\nWorld news summarised faster than mach 3\nBeing intelligent persons, you may\nhave noticed that we are reaching the\nend of the page and so therefore the\nend of my article. The U.S.A. faces\nproblems on a scale that it has not faced\nsince its conception with the War of\nIndependence. It faces a world resentful of its mistakes made in the War on\nTerror and worst still its enemies hold\nall the cards in this oil-addicted planet.\nIts status as a superpower, which has\nbeen unchallenged since the fall of the\nSoviet Union, will see fresh opposition\nwith the rise of China and the return to\nauthoritarian government in Russia. As\na result of the mis-handling of government by the Bush Administration the\nUnited States finds itself with more enemies than friends. With luck I\u2019ve given\na broad \u2013 but by no means complete\n\u2013 and detailed \u2013 but by no means entirely precise \u2013 view of the U.S.A Today\nand with even more luck I\u2019ve left you\nbetter informed to consider the U.S.A\nTomorrow.\nBy January 2009, the White House, heart of the world\u2019s primary superpower, will have a new occupant with the chance of repairing the nation\u2019s image\n10 felix Friday 30 November 2007\n\n"

The Union is\nhosting an Ann Summers party in the Union Dining Hall for ladies\nand there will be a Pole Dancing show in dB\u2019s for the men.\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\nNew Visa system: Students absent for more than 14 days should\nbe reported to the Home Office within 5 working days\nUniversities could be forced to implement draconian monitoring of all students\u2019 attendance under the Government\u2019s newly proposed immigration\nsystem. Within the next 18 months\nstudents may have to register their\npresence at each lecture, in order to\nensure that college is fully aware of\ntheir movements.\nUnder the Home Office\u2019s new\n\u201cPoints Based System\u201d (PBS) of im-migration, international students will\nbe \u201cSponsored\u201d by their educational\ninstitution in order to receive a visa, in\na bid to eliminate the fraudulent use of\nstudent visas as an immigration \u201cback\ndoor.\u201d The \u201cSponsor\u201d (in this case, the\nUniversity) must be accredited by an\napproved body, and has several duties:\none of which is to report students who\ndo not attend their course, and those\nwho fail to register.\nAccording to the proposed rules for\n\u201cTier 4\u201d of the system (the section that\napplies to students), if an international\nstudent is absent for 14 days the University must report this to the Home\nOffice within 5 working days. If they\nfail to do this, their \u201cAccredited Sponsor\u201d status may be revoked, immediately invalidating all visas that they\nsponsor.\nIn many courses at Imperial, failure\nof a single student to attend for two\nweeks would be easily overlooked in a\nclass with hundreds of students, especially if there is little laboratory work.\nA registration of international students\nat seminars, tutorials and even lectures\ncould be the only way of ensuring that\nabsencesarenoticed.However,singling\nout only the international students for\nsuch treatment would undoubtedly\nbe met with some protest. Indeed, an\ninternal paper from the University\nof Edinburgh on the subject feared\nthat \u201cintrusive attendance monitoring\nwhich [the University] believe would\nhave to apply to all students to avoid\nfalling foul of the Race Relations Act,\u201d\nwhich is an interpretation also voiced\nby sources at Imperial College.\nThe PBS is one of several new measures designed to combat immigration\nand terrorism issues in education, with\nthe Academic Technology Approval\nScheme (ATAS) recently started earlier this month. The ATAS system is\ndesigned as a register of foreign national postgraduates who are studying\ncourses in technologies that could be\nused in weapons of mass destruction\nand terrorism (most of which are offered by Imperial); requiring students\nto apply with their course and personal\ndetails before being allowed a visa, in\norder to prevent the dissemination of\n\u201csensitive\u201d expertise.\nThe Government is keen to be seen\naddressing the issues of security and\nimmigration after recent political de-bacles, but questions are being asked\nover the practicalities of the reformed\nsystems, and universities across the\ncountry are pushing for changes to the\nplan.\nWhilst the PBS was well-received by\ninstitutions on announcement, debate\nover the details is likely to continue\nas the system does not become active\nuntil early 2009. Many universities are\nconcerned about the legal implications\nof their \u201cSponsor\u201d status, and have a\ndifficult task in finding how to strike a\nbalance between applying the controls\nimposed on them by the Home Office,\nand allowing students the freedom that\nthey demand.\nDid you miss this Quantum Mechanics lecture yesterday?

Abandoned by his original team,\nHalsey was convinced to continue his\njourney by a fervent and gregarious\nstranger at a bar.\nRefocusing and with new teammate\nSouchuk, he set out in the spring of\n1977 to trek across the entire continent\nfrom Vancouver to the banks of the\nSt Lawrence river on the East Coast,\neschewing any motorised transport-travelling by foot, canoe and dogsled.\nLandau completed the novel after Halsey\u2019s death making the account even\nmore affecting, for better or worse.\nMagnetic North is an incredible and\ninspiring tale for its distilled and pure\nsense of passion and overwhelming\nsense of accomplishment. It is clear\nthat Halsey, a suburbanite, was born\nto be out in the woods. The descriptions of the landscapes and the people\nhe meets are uplifting \u2013 every face\nis imaginable, every step seemingly\ntraceable. More than any other tale of\nadventure, it makes you want to be out\nthere, pack on your back, stepping out\ninto the frosted wilderness.\nDon DeLillo \u2013 Americana\nNot his best novel, but as far as debuts\ngo, pretty blinding. The journey in this\ncase is that of David Bell, a late twenty-something TV exec who, sick of living\nin his cynical little dream of America,\ntakes on an assignment with a camera\nteam to explore and make a film on the\nsprawling urban landscape and society\nof America.\nHeralding the arrival of a major tal-ent, Americana is sparkling in its descriptions of characters and half-laughs\nand half-despairs like its characters.\nCriticised as being not plot-centric\nenough, its portraits are exciting and\nDeLillo\u2019s prose never misses a beat.\nCynical, detached, seemingly past the\npoint of caring \u2013 as a reader, you experience all of these in DeLillo\u2019s style and\nmore. Pretty authentic, then.\nJack Kerouac \u2013 On The Road\n\u201cA selection of road novels would be\nunthinkable without the ultimate paean to the essence of road travel\u201d. Or,\nthat\u2019s what I would have said if I had\nreviewed it earlier. Never quite instilling the same respect as other writers\ninstalled in literary canon, yet hugely\ninfluential, Kerouac had a rollercoaster career from a struggling, middling\nwriter living with relatives on the East\nCoast, to the self-styled \u201cKing of the\nBeatniks\u201d, which he references in later\nnovels after On The Road. You could\ntrace a line in his life, his dreams and\nregrets through his novels, up to his\nbreaking point in Big Sur. Any of his\nwild, frantic novels could make the\ncut (including the wonderful Visions of\nCody) but On The Road is where it all\nstarted.\nLeaving his aunt\u2019s house in New York\nstate to follow the wildly charismatic\nDean Moriarty (Kerouac\u2019s real life\nfriend and fellow Beat Neal Cassady)\non the road, the novel plots their travels across the great plains of the Midwest and the mountains of the Rockies\nto the sunlicked hills of central California, all wide-eyed and partied-up in a\nfeverish need to feed off the essence\nand joy of pure being.\nLegend has it that On The Road was\nwritten in a long, continuous Benzedrine-fuelled session after Kerouac\nreturned back from his adventures.\nOffering an alternative to Fitzgerald\u2019s American dream of material and\nwealth-driven excess, On The Road\nserved up a new ideology and set a\nprecedent that echoes powerfully even\nin our generation.\nMari Akasaka \u2013 Vibrator\nVibrator was received as a portrait of a\ngenerational crisis in its native Japan.\nThis is not a book for the light hearted.\nIt follows Rei, a journalist \u2013 young,\nlost, neurotic, the usual \u2013 who meets\na truck driver late one night in a convenience store. She is wrenched from\nthe monotony and neurosis of her daily\nlife by an inexplicable attraction to him\nand joins him on an emotional road-trip through the backroads of Japan\nwhile reliving her traumatic childhood\nand searching for the kind of self-un-derstanding that crystallises only during the course of a journey.\nDealing in extremes, it is rich and\nintricate in parts, while delivering bullish verbal haymakers in others. Case\nin point; Rei\u2019s opening stream of consciousness outpourings while in her local convenience store in the middle of\nthe night. One part of you thinks Natsuo Kirino, the other is imagining Jeff\nBridges as The Dude strolling down\nthe aisle, milk in his beard. Despite its\nminimalist components \u2013 set over the\ncourse of a night, involving just two\ncharacters in a very short novel \u2013 Akasaka tells the story of Rei with skill and\ndelicacy.\nEthan Hawke \u2013 Ash Wednesday\nCall it variety, call it novelty value or\ncall it curiosity, but as far as writing\nattempts by famously moody and reflective Hollywood creative types go,\nHawke\u2019s Ash Wednesday isn\u2019t as bad\nas it could be. Certainly given the efforts of current celebs to release autobiographies to cash in on their fifteen minutes, it is commendable that\nHawke actually bothered to put pen\nto paper and work through the agony\nthat is \u2018Writing A Novel\u2019 for 200 pages.\nThe story recounts a familiar tale of\nstar-crossed lovers Jimmy and Christie, travelling Transamerica to recount\nforgotten scenes and trace memories,\nseparated, yet upon re-evaluation of\ntheir lives, realising that the other is all\nthey\u2019ve got.\nThe character descriptions and developments are pretty interesting given\nthat novels are probably not Hawke\u2019s\nforte, but for anyone who\u2019s seen his\nconversational epics with Julie Delpy\n(Before Sunrise/Before Sunset) and is\nwondering just what is going on in the\nmind of the man (or is just plain curi-ous) it\u2019s worth a look. Available from\nAmazon for next to nada \u2013 worth a\nlook for the curious amongst you.\nDeLillo\u2019s Americana is one of cynicism and detachment, while Vibrator is more about the resonance of\nmemory than what you\u2019re thinking\nGuevara\u2019s Motorcycle Diaries was adapted into a Walter Salles film not so long ago Lucifer chews on Judas\u2019 and Brutus\u2019 faces.

A text studied by\ndozens of thousands every year,\nfrom GCSE and A-Level right up to\nuniversity level, not only invites tremendous amount of criticism (some\nof it more constructive than the rest),\nit sets expectations of the audience at\na very high threshold. Despite one or\ntwo directorial kinks, first time director Rebecca Banerjee has overseen and\ntaken care of her actors rather well and\nis to be commended for it.\nThe level of talent is fantastic. It is\nrefreshing to see a science focused institution such as ours still abounding\nwith artistic capacity. The interactions\nbetween character pairs felt substantial and genuine. Hugh Mor O\u2019Donnell\nplayed by Sam Abu-Wardeh was particularly good. His voice projection was\nspot on, as was his acting.

It felt real and not in the slightest\ncontrived. Lara Gill\u2019s (playing Maire)\nbreathing and sighing while on stage\nwith Alex (playing Yolland) was quite\ngripping. The pair was able to transmit\nthe awkward but enchanting, childlike\nstate of being utterly in love and knowing it can last.\nManus\u2019 (Andrew Somerville) slouching and eyes reveal a character that is\nclearly tormented and distraught \u2013 a\nromantic fool who has not had the\nfortune of requited love. His voice\nand somewhat disgruntled and aimless walk heighten the sense of loss in\nhim. His interaction with Sarah (Lucy\nAnderson) before he exits was beautifully depressing. The two capture\nthe essence of that anagnorisis and\nquick moment of realisation just before forcefully losing someone forever.\nLucy\u2019s part is a tough one due to the\nlack of spoken lines. Everything is in\nthe eyes and body language; however\nshe rises to the challenge and plays her\npart flawlessly.\nJimmy-Jack played by Seb Junemann\nwas another star in the play. His presence is electrifying and his scene of\ndrunken stupor is worthy of note. His\nenunciation and intoxicated behaviour\nis such that it would make a tough, inebriated pirate sit in a corner and cry\nin shame.\nOwen, played by Brandon CanoErrecart was the only character to be\nslightly detached. While his peers all\ntry hard (ones more successfully than\nothers) to put on the Irish accent,\nBrandon fails to do so, differentiating\nand placing him on plane different to\nthe others. His communications feel\nstrange, not because he is not a good\nactor in his own right, but because\nhis American accent props up too often rendering his character much less\ncredible and believable.\nOne cannot miss the care that has\nalso gone into creating the set. Kaushali Trivedi and his team clearly worked\nlong and hard making sure the audience would be transported to Ireland\nin the early 1800s.\nWhile the creative side is certainly\nworthy of this perhaps ego-boosting\nreview, the production of the play\nfaltered slightly, One would expect\nsomething more than six weeks in the\nmaking to have been the target of some\nserious marketing efforts. The sort of\nturnout on opening night was rather\nuninspiring, with under thirty souls\nscattered throughout the auditorium.\nThe quality of the program is also\nrather poor. It is badly designed and\nwritten, and with over 6 fonts used, it\nis incoherent and difficult to read. It\nseems perhaps unfair that the actors\nput so much work and devotion into\nthe machine, only to have their work\nappreciated by an empty house. It is\ntime Imperial productions start making their actors proud and filling up\nthose seats, whatever it takes.\nLeft to right: Lucy Anderson, Seb Junemann and Felix\u2019s very own Andrew Somerville\nThe Translations cast inspire others to audition for future Dramsoc productions\n\n"

Your social life\nis dwindling down to a night-in by the\nfireplace, and your friends are starting\nto think you\u2019re actually a pensioner in\ndisguise because it\u2019s always \u201ctoo nippy\nto leave the house.\u201d\nYou, my son, need a new coat and\nfast.\nTake off that duffel coat you\u2019ve had\nsince you were 13, just burn that fluorescent bomber; and buy a nice, new,\nDaniel Wan trawls through mountains of wool and polyester for the sake of fashion\nThe standard black Pea-coat from\nTopman, a majority blend of wool\nand polyester, and one of the safest\nand most reasonable options out\nthere at \u00a370. Get the right size and\nyou can\u2019t go wrong.\nThe large collar and lapel means\nyou can wear it further up against\nyour neck for extra coverage, and\nlook like Eric Cantona whilst you\ndo it.\nThe only downside to this purchase is that you\u2019re still spending\n\u00a370 on something you\u2019ll see several\nmillion other people wearing.\nTopman breed clones, and now\nI\u2019m just starting to get a sense of\ndeja-vu. However, this coat is stylish and understated enough to just\nabout get away with it.\nThis River Island Pea-coat is\nslightly longer than the Topman\none, and should end just below the\nwaist. In other words, more arse-coverage, which in turn, equals a\nwarm backside and that\u2019s always a\ngood thing, right?\nFor \u00a35 more than the Topman\nPea coat (at \u00a375), this coat emits a\nlot more style, hanging in between\nVictorian-military and cutting-edge\nmodern. On top of this you do end\nup looking like the 6th member of\nKasabian too.\nIt only comes in grey, which may\nnot go with absolutely everything\nyou wear underneath. Also be wary\nof the quality of River Island win-terwear. It may not last one week,\nnever mind one winter.\nThis double breasted crombie from\nRiver Island takes another few inches\ndown from the previous cut. It should\nendonyourthighs,givingago-between\nshort and three-quarter lengths.\nThe wool-polyester blend will ensure\ntoastiness whilst waiting for your 6am\nbus, and the contrast trim on lapels\nand pocket flaps add a very stylish and\ndapper addition to the bog-standard\nblack jacket.\nThis could potentially be worn over\na suit to work, or with a pullover and\njeans on the weekend. Its simplicity in\nstyle and versatility gives makes this\ncoat a great purchase,\nWith a twinge of British schoolboy\nand an exciting edge, River Island have\ndelivered the goods once again. At\n\u00a389.99, it\u2019s certainly worth the money\nyou\u2019d have to shell out for it, even on\nlooks alone.\nMilitary-inspired winterwear has been\nprevalent for the past few years, and\nis starting to overwhelm the market.\nHowever, this \u201cNeonair\u201d Pea-coat by\nFull Circle is given a complete makeover from its more conventional Pea\ncoat counterparts.\nNormally, faux-fur trims on anything look overbearing or just plain\ntacky, but this jacket manages to pull\nit off with a certain degree of subtlety.\nNevertheless, the black fur collar is de-tachable. The traditional double row of\nbuttons is scrapped in favour of an off-centre row of functional buttons complemented with a concealed half zip.\nAvailable at Urban Outfitters, but\nthis jacket\u2019s recommended retail price\nof \u00a3210 may send you into your overdraft all over again.\nTweed is no longer only for old men\nand geography teachers, and this coat\nproves it.\nThis coat by Ringspun drops three\nquarters down the body, and is a more\nobvious fitted cut than the three-quar-ter lengths found in Topman or River\nIsland.\nIt features an adjustable backbelt, allowing the coat to follow natural body\nshape tightly, or to hang a bit looser.\nThe mid-brown tweed refuses to look\ndated and is a refreshing colour from\ncrowds of black and greys; yet is still\nunderstated enough to blend in for\ngeneral use.\nDespite being only 25% wool, it is\navailable from ASOS.com for \u00a3115,\nnot including postage and packaging.\nEven coats nowadays are subject to\n\u2018East meets West\u2019 amalgamations, and\nhere\u2019s a prime example.\nThis is Burton\u2019s most interesting offering this season. A lot of their range is\nvery similar and fairly generic, but this\nsubtle variation on a standard waist\ndropping black Pea-coat. The obligatory double-breasted button rows are\npresent, but it also features an interesting Mandarin collar.\nYou might end up looking like a\npriest if you wear a high-neck white\nshirt underneath, but you take that risk\nwith a lot of things.\nThere\u2019s not much you can do this\ncoat however. Wearing a scarf with this\ntype of collar might prove difficult, and\nwearing the jacket open ruins the look.\nStyle over practicality for \u00a385.\nIt seems you can\u2019t escape looking like\neither an armyman or a hooligan.\nThis casual cotton \u2018Detroit field\njacket\u2019 from Full Circle features drawstring waist and hem for extra snug-ness amongst the winter chill.\nStandard zip and popper combina-tion, and a choice of green or black,\nUrban Outfitters retail this jacket at\n\u00a3115.\nHowever, it is alarmingly similar to a\n\u00a320 \u2018German\u2019 field jacket found in army\nsurplus stores (notorious in Camden),\nand from personal experience you\u2019re\nalways in danger of looking like a hobo\neverytime you sit down outside (I once\ngot a free pastry from Starbucks because I was wearing this jacket\u2026)\nCertainly not a coat you can wear\na suit under, but like the parka, its\nwarmth outstrips its rather shabby\naesthetic.\nstylish coat.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 30 November 2007 felix\nPolitics\nof al-Qaeda from Afghanistan certainly\ndealt a huge blow to their operations,\nit would be incredibly na\u00efve to equate\nthe defeat of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan\n(it would also be quite na\u00efve to suppose that this defeat was complete) to\nthe destruction of international terror-ism. In short, because I know I\u2019ve gone\non long enough, it doesn\u2019t seem to me\nthat the war on terror is achieving very\nmuch nor does it seem to me that very\nmuch can be achieved by the large-scale invasion of nations.\nWhen I stated that there was no reason for the inexplicable invasion of\nIraq, I\u2019m sure many of you immediately\nthought of oil. The black stuff is incalculably important in the 21st century\nfor a myriad of reasons and there\u2019s no\ndoubt that its extraction, transportation and consumption weighs heavily on the economy and politics of the\nU.S.A. President George W. Bush, in\nthis year\u2019s State of the Union address,\nwarned of an addiction to imported oil\nand its perils. I\u2019m going to convince of\nyou how extensive the addiction and\ntangible the peril is in this case.\nYou\u2019ll be shocked to hear it but the\nsecurity threat due to the U.S.\u2019s oil dependence is far greater than the threat\nof international terrorism. Lets take a\nlook at why. In the ten countries with\nthe biggest oil reserves, we find among\nothers Iran, Russia and Venezuela.\nWhile these are the three countries\nwith especially frosty relationships\nwith U.S.A at this point, the top ten\ncountries in general are either instable,\ncorrupt or have political interests that\ndo not align with the U.S. Examples of\nthese are Iraq, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. It just so happens that most of the\noil in the world is situated in places inhabited by people who don\u2019t have the\naverage American\u2019s interests at heart.\nThis is important because of the enormous wealth that is generated through\nthe sale of oil. The people whose interests diverge from America\u2019s are extremely well funded and have a disproportionately large political clout due to\ntheir oil. Russia is able to move towards\nauthoritarianism while simultaneously\nIran continues with confidence with\nits nuclear program; because of their\noil wealth, these and other producer\ncountries are free to ignore U.S. policies and to pursue interests inimical\nto the national security of the United\nStates. This problem is furthered because it reduces the ability of the U.S. to\nachieve its\u2019 goals through multi-lateral\nchannels. I\u2019m lucky enough to have the\nperfect example of this readily available\nin the form of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nThe U.S. has attempted to gain direct\nand strong action through the U.N and\nthe E.U, the U.N. most notably of the\ntwo. It is nearly impossible for the U.S.\nto persuade the Security Council to\ntake significant action because two ve-to-holding members \u2013 China and Russia \u2013 are more interested in Iran\u2019s oil\nreserves than its nuclear capabilities.\nChina in particular provides support\nto oil producing countries that the U.S.\nwould rather isolate, due to the massive demand for oil from its growing\neconomy.\nToday the purchase of oil has become\nblind. Oil takes precedence in foreign\npolicy and other factors become invis-ible, we are blinded to them. Consider\nthe close relationship of the U.S. with\nSaudi Arabia. The land of the free is\nclosely allied with a nation that recently sentenced a woman to 90 lashes after being raped by a gang of seven men;\nher crime was being in the same car as\na male friend who was also raped in\nthe same incident. I had to include this\npiece of recent news because it demonstrates the misogynistic, dictatorial\nand oppressive governance in Saudi\nArabia. The United States is forced to\ndeal with nations that are run in complete contradiction to the values that it\nwas founded on due to its dependence\non oil. Things become even stranger\nwhen you take a closer look at the relationship between Venezuela and the\nU.S. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the ranting of Hugo Chavez and realized that\nhe is opposed to U.S. involvement in\nSouthern American affairs but what\nyou may not know is that Venezuela is\nthe U.S.\u2019s fourth largest supplier of oil.\nIn reality, U.S. dollars are directly financing the efforts of Chavez to attack\nU.S. influence in Southern America.\nWestern Civilization is built on oil.\nIn terms of the products derived from\ncrude oil and the direct energy uses\nsuch as in transport, oil could be said\nto be everywhere in our society. This\naddiction has resulted in the dangerous international position as described\nabove. Although the solution is hard\nto swallow it is certainly not difficult\nto imagine. Increase efficiency of oil\nand gas use, switch from oil-derived\nproducts to alternatives, encourage\nsupply of oil from sources outside the\nPersian Gulf, make the oil and gas infrastructure more efficient and secure\nand increase investment in new energy\ntechnologies. Simple eh?\nIt probably could be simple if the\nmen and women in Capitol Hill really\nhad the foresight and will to make it\nhappen. Unfortunately the environment has not become a popular political issue in the U.S. as it has here in the\nUK. Despite this let\u2019s look at the current political goings-on in the U.S.A.\nJust a short aside, Bush has well and\ntruly become a lame-duck president.\nDuring his first term he did not use his\npresidential veto against congressional\nbills once. However, recently he has\nused his veto on bills with both public\nand bi-partisan support, and in fact on\none occasion has had his veto overridden by congress. With the democrats\nin control of both houses on Capitol\nHill, governance in Washington has\nbecome a case of Congress versus the\nPresident.\nBy far the most interesting event in\nthe U.S. at the moment is the upcoming Presidential Election. In my eyes\nthere are two candidates who have a\nchance of winning.\nHillary Clinton. If you don\u2019t know\nwho Hillary Clinton is then you must\nhave spent much of the 90\u2019s living under a rock. Wife to former President\nBill Clinton, she is widely seen as the\nfrontrunner to gain the Democrat\nnomination and then the Presidency.\nShe began her campaign by saying \u201cI\u2019m\nin, I\u2019m in to win\u201d. From the start Hillary\nClinton\u2019s campaign has been based on\nunwavering confidence of victory and\nwith some polls putting her 27 points\nahead of her democratic rivals it\u2019s hard\nto disagree with her confidence. Like\nmost Presidential elections, there is a\nfocus on personality rather than the is-sues. She has been lauded as an Iron\nlady. Certainly her gender puts her in\na unique position as she would become the first ever female president\nof the U.S.A. Accused of playing the\ngender card at a televised debate held\nin Las Vegas she responded: \u201cPeople\nare not attacking me because I\u2019m a\nwoman; they\u2019re attacking me because\nI\u2019m ahead.\u201d Nonetheless, critics \u2013 some\nwithin her own party \u2013 continue to put\nforward arguments against her running\nin the general election race. She is said\nto be a divisive figure for which some\nAmericans would never vote. That,\nhowever, applies to almost every politi-cian. Other commentators have ques-Hillary Clinton leads the polls ahead of what many bill as the most open US Presidential race in recent history; but is she too devisive?\nThe invasion of Iraq will most likely be the defining memory of George Bush\u2019s presidency\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s\ncampaign has\nbeen based on\nunwavering\nconfidence\u201d\n\n"

After that, everyone has precisely\nthirty-six hours to invoke Christmas\non me. You can throw ribbons at me,\nyou can stuff mince pies so far down\nmy throat I start crapping raisins, you\ncan play the same fucking rerun of\nHarry Potter if you really want to. I\nwon\u2019t complain.\nObviously, the reason they want\nChristmas to start early is because it\nmeans you\u2019re more likely to buy things\nmore often, and start cosying down for\nthe winter like we\u2019re living in the New\nWorld circa 1700. Which, for some rea-son, you\u2019re all more than happy to do.\nWaltzing around with seventeen layers\nof clothing on, staggering in whenever\nthere\u2019s a slight breeze as if you\u2019ve just\ntrekked for four days across the tundra,\nand saying things like \u201cIt\u2019s cold out.\u201d as\nyou walk into a lecture theatre.\nI didn\u2019t sleep here overnight, alright,\nI\u2019m well aware it\u2019s bloody cold out. I\njust don\u2019t have the urge to whine about\nit like it\u2019s a bad government policy. \u201cAh,\nwouldn\u2019t\u2019ve have had this shit under\nBlair. Oh no. He knew how to regulate\nweather fronts.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not even winter yet, you cowardly\nbastards. The holly was going up in Oxford Street in late October. The leaves\non the trees had barely fallen down\nthen, probably because they reasoned\nit would be less effort to just hang on\nfor a couple of weeks until Spring was\ndeclared again. This is the time of year\nyou go out for long walks and mince\naround in piles of red and gold in Hyde\nPark, not act like you\u2019re Lawrence\nOates and popping out to get a pint\nof milk is some dangerous expedition.\nThe guy died in a blizzard to save an\nexpedition team, and even he probably\nmade less of a fuss of it than some of\nyou seem to.\nLeave the coat at home tomorrow\nand enjoy the cold a little. Remember\nwhen seeing your breath in the air used\nto be fun? Yeah? Well, instead of replacing that for tacky versions of the\nsame products you\u2019ve been buying all\nyear \u2013 gingerbread my arse, Starbucks\n\u2013 try to remember why Winter is fun.\nChristmas will happen in its own time,\nit\u2019s the same sodding day every year.\nDon\u2019t let the preceding month get\ndrowned in a wash of red and green\ntinsel.\nKiekhov vs. Oppningbukh\nGilead Amit\n(An extract from the transcript of the\n1998 World Chess Championship final,\nas broadcast on PKWN radio)\n\u2018\u2026a tightly-contested match that is\nsure to be the highlight of the season.\nKiekhov to make the first move; you\ncan feel the tension in the auditorium\nas his fingers hover over the board \u2013\nand they\u2019re off! Kiekhov opens with\nthe Pushkin attack, a tactic that won\nhim the World Championship against\nObvistschek last year. Oppningbukh\nresponds with the Flamingo defence,\nand both sides are now busy trying to\ngain control of the centre.\u2019\n\u2018White brings his knights into play\n\u2013 Kiekhov has long been thought of as\nhaving some of the best knights in the\ngame, an advantage he\u2019s going to have\nto use effectively to have any hope of\nbreaking through Oppningbukh\u2019s de-fence, which is in stellar form in this\nmatch. Oppningbukh racing down the\nKing side \u2013 h5, g4! What an advance,\nhe\u2019s made it to g4 \u2013 Kiekhov is going to need everything in his arsenal\nto hold him back now. Wait! What\u2019s\nthis? Oppningbukh has left a gaping\nhole in his defence \u2013 you can tell by\nhis grimace that he\u2019s just noticed; will\nKiekhov?\u2019\n\u2018This position is almost identical to\nthat of Studebaker v Salzkartoffel in\nthe Euro Championship final of 1994 \u2013\nStudebaker won in the last few seconds\nof gametime, barely edging past black\u2019s\npawn structure to win the game with\ntrue style. They don\u2019t play games like\nthat anymore, do they, Jack?\u2019\n\u2018No, they certainly don\u2019t, Tim, but\nKiekhov is certainly up there with\nthe greats; it might almost be KnottHorseigh himself behind the board,\nruthlessly exploiting the weaknesses\nin his opponent\u2019s defence and setting\nhimself up beautifully for a potential\nqueen-side mate. I\u2019ve got to tell you,\nthough, I\u2019m impressed with Oppningbukh\u2019s stamina for holding on at this\nstage of the game.\u2019\n\u2018I know what you mean, Jack; it really\ntakes a cool mind to play the Sashimi\ncountergambit when your centre control is weakening by the move.\u2019\n\u2018Kiekhov\u2019s move \u2013 he\u2019s pushing his\npieces up the board; he\u2019s spotted something \u2013 knight, now rook \u2013 then bishop from the other side\u2026check! Check\nagain! Oppningbukh\u2019s on the run, desperately trying to get to his king before\nKiekhov\u2019s attack.\u2019\n\u2018And it fails! So close and yet so far!\nOppningbukh\u2019s queen-side rook saving the day with a heroic self-sacrifice\nto keep the match going. As the piece\nis carried off the table amid rousing\ncheers, Oppningbukh knows that his\nline-up is one short. \u2018\n\u2018This is the exciting part of the\nmatch, Timmy boy, isn\u2019t it? The tension mounting as the clock ticks down,\nonly a handful of pieces left, slogging it\nout till the final whistle.\u2019\n\u2018It really makes you glad to be alive,\nalright. I have a hunch that it\u2019s not going to last for much longer, though \u2013\nKiekhov\u2019s got that glint in his eye I\u2019d\nknow anywhere; I\u2019d say he\u2019s looking to\nmake a final queen-side push.\u2019\n\u2018You may be right, Timmikins; if I\nwere to make an attack at the moment,\nthat\u2019s where I\u2019d go \u2013 battered-down de-fence, uncoordinated attack, with the\nopen file going all the way down. I wonder if he won\u2019t go for the transposed\nReagan-Gorbachev manoeuvre?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019d say the Bush-Hussein variation\nwould be more his style. There! Look!\nThe queen-side pawns edging closer to\nrow 8!\u2019\n\u2018Almost there, boys, only a few more\nrows to go!\u2019\n\u2018Oppningbukh completely out of the\ngame now, Kiekhov taking full control\nas he makes a substitution. B-file pawn\nout \u2013 well-played, tremendous board-coverage; that\u2019s a piece we\u2019ll see emulated in chess clubs the world over by\ntomorrow, eh Jack?\u2019\n\u2018Unquestionably; fine fellow. But\nKiekhov exchanges him for his queen;\nwise move, on the whole \u2013 the queen\ndoes tend to make a crucial change\nto the match, even in the last few\nseconds.\u2019\n\u2018Look at the difference made already!\nIt\u2019s check again! This time with no easy\nescape!\u2019\n\u2018Check! Check! Oppningbukh\u2019s king\nhopelessly tries to escape Kiekhov\u2019s coordinated attack, but it\u2019s just too much!\nOne final push\u2026and there it is! Mate!\nMate! Maaaaaate!!\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s done it! Kiekhov has brought\nthe title back to Lithuania! Fantastic!\nWhat do you have to say to that, Jack?\u2019\n\u2018Mate! Mate! Maaaaaaaaaaate!\u2019\n\u2018As you can tell, Jack\u2019s still a little\ncaught up in the emotion of the mo-ment, and who can blame him!

We got\nthat 10 [ten] years ago with Super\nMario 64, though.

Whereas Mario 64 was a lesson in purist platforming with its satisfying triple jumps, wall-jumps and\nlong jumps, Sunshine took the emphasis away from its central character and\nshifted the action towards a stupidly\nnamed hose. Manoeuvring Sunshine\u2019s\nworlds was more about hovering\nawkwardly across gaps and collecting Shines which inevitably involved\nspraying water over some brown gunk.\nIt literally became a case of rinse and\nrepeat.\nAs you can probably tell, I wasn\u2019t\nexactly enamoured with Nintendo\u2019s effort during the Gamecube\u2019s generation.\nA little part of me died inside when\nI defeated Bowser and subsequently\ncouldn\u2019t be arsed to collect the collect the remaining stars. I refuse to call\nthem Shines out of principle, in case\nyou were wondering. Sunshine left me\ncold; I felt like an England fan who\u2019d\njust watched their country crash out\nof the Euro Championships qualifying\nstage in the knowledge that it would be\nat least three years before their next fix\nof international football fever.\nThankfully my gaming hiatus has\npassed and Super Mario Galaxy is\nhere, finally. In some senses it is as\nmuch of a step backwards as it is for-wards: stars are stars once again, Mario\nis required to rely on his own legs and\nyou no longer have to collect coins like\nan OCD sufferer in order to get all\n120 stars within the game. Nintendo\nhave listened to the mixed reception\nSunshine received and returned to the\ncore game play elements that made\nMario 64 such an addictive title. Most\nsuccessfully of all, Galaxy has retained\nthat just-one-more-star feel that Mario\n64 nailed so perfectly.\nCollecting each star is a mini-ad-venture in Galaxy. Your base camp\nfor adventures is the Comet Observatory and located on it are a number of\nDomes which house Launch Stars that\nshoot you on your way to the various\ngalaxies. Mario soars into each galaxy\nlike Superman/Neo \u2013 depending on\nyour level of geekdom \u2013 and somersaults with a flourish announcing his\narrival and the start of his star hunting\nmini-adventure. Collecting a star takes\n5 to 20 minutes and finding each one\nis like being administered with a saline solution of happiness. You share\nMario\u2019s glee as he grabs each golden\nstar because the journey getting there is such an\nenjoyable one.\nGalaxies\nare incredibly\ndiverse.\nThey\nrange in\nsizes with some\nthat contain single\nstars whilst the main levels house 4 or 5. Most galaxies contain a series of planets for Mario to\nfly between. These planets range from\nspherical bodies to twisting, spiralling platforms to more conventional\nworlds that Mario can wander around\nto insane levels made purely of blocks\nthat don\u2019t resemble planets at all. The\nwhole galactic set up is just an excuse\nfor Nintendo to create what appear to\nbe mind-bendingly complex levels. Often the star you\u2019re after will be located\non the other side of the galaxy and the\ninexperienced could be forgiven for\nwondering how in Zeus\u2019 name you\u2019re\nsupposed to get the stars, but as you\nget used to the universe Mario finds\nhimself in, you learn and begin to appreciate Miyamoto\u2019s Special Relativity\nand Advanced Nintendo Mechanics.\nYou learn which planets will allow you\nto jump with their curvature, which\nones you\u2019ll fall off if you take a step over\nthe edge, which ones you can\nrun around in all directions and whether\nit\u2019s possible\nto jump\ninto the\nOMG, it\u2019s SMG!\nTom \u201cTomolini\u201d Roberts answers a plumbing call from a galaxy far, far away...\ngravitational pull\nof a planet\nwithout falling\ninto the black abyss\nbelow.\nTravelling between the planets makes\nthe galaxies appear deceptively large\ntoo; it\u2019s difficult to tell how vast the\nlevels are in comparison to Mario 64\nbut there is an enormous sense of scale\nas you fly through space. Often when\nyou\u2019re propelled from a Launch Star\nyou\u2019re rewarded with a glorious overview of the entire potential play area\nand you soon become eager to venture\nto every corner of each galaxy.\nReader\nRiposte\nInterplanetary space hopping is a\nsignificantly ingenious addition to the\nplatforming genre such that Galaxy\ndoesn\u2019t ever feel stale, although elsewhere the game remains faithful to its\nprequels. The mantra: \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke,\ntweak it,\u201d definitely applies here. Mario\nnow spin attacks rather than punching\nand he has had his health bar chopped\nin half meaning he can only suffer\nthree blows before death; a welcome\nchange which makes the game mildly\nmore difficult. Some methods for collecting stars remain familiar including bopping bosses three times on the\nweak spot, racing penguins and catching bunny rabbits, however the newly\nintroduced mushroom power-ups\n(including Bee, Boo, Ice and Spring\nMario) bring welcome variety along\nwith plenty of innovatively designed\nlevels you wouldn\u2019t find in the previous\ngames.\nWhilst Mario\u2019s latest outing is nigh-on perfect, there are a few issues worth\nraising. Firstly, Galaxy is somehow\nmore linear than the previous games.\nIt has retained Sunshine\u2019s awful feature where a cut-scene showed you the\npath to a star just before you entered\na level, thus softening the adventure\nelement slightly. This can be avoided\neasily enough by just looking at your\ncrotch\u2026 er, away from the screen.\nHowever, whereas Mario 64 gave you\na set of sandpits to explore, collecting stars in whichever order you liked,\nGalaxy more or less forces you to find\nits stars in a given order. The worlds\nchange depending on which star you\nopt to go in search of, meaning that\nyou don\u2019t get the satisfaction of locating a star just from clue in its title.\nGalaxy richly deserves its current\nlofty number two status on the games-rankings.com all time Top 10. Mario\n64 was praised for bringing platform\ngames successfully into three dimensions and whilst this was no mean feat,\nit was almost inevitable that Nintendo\nor someone else would do it eventually.\nBuilding a cart is easy, but reinventing\nthe wheel is far more difficult and second time round Nintendo has succeeded with aplomb.\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 30 November 2007 felix\nArts\nAre you sitting comfortably? Good\nMike Cook is wondering whether he should act his age when it comes to his choice of reading material\nI\ndon\u2019t read an awful lot. That\nmay come as a surprise to those\nof you who were foolish enough\nto believe that the Felix staff had\nany experience or knowledge of\ntheir subject whatsoever. The truth is\nthat I, like many of you, simply have\ntoo much to do. When reading gets\nslotted in, I need to go for something\nenjoyable. There was a time when I\u2019d\nbe taking recommendations, hovering\nin the Penguin Classics section and\nso on. But at the moment, I just want\nsomething to read.\nNow, it gets a bit difficult here because on the one hand, it\u2019s not like I\nstill watch kids television on a Saturday\nmorning. The fact that I don\u2019t have a\ntelevision set is neither here nor there\n\u2013 the point is, I\u2019m too old for it. Even if\nPokemon was just getting good. Similarly, I try to lay off consuming large\namounts of sugar and running around\nuntil I bang into a doorframe because\nit\u2019s a little unbecoming. And also I can\u2019t\nafford sweets.\nIn general, really, getting older\nmeans doing older things. Grown-up\nstuff. Stuff that seemed boring when\nyou were younger, like studying, and\nnow still seems pretty much as boring.\nLike studying. However, when it comes\nto books I don\u2019t find it as easy to draw\nthe mark.\nMaybe it\u2019s because a story is a story,\nand at the end of the day it\u2019s either a\ngood one or it isn\u2019t. The presentation\nof the thing is entirely in my mind \u2013 if I\nwant Doctor Seuss to be a battle-hard-ened demon slayer I\u2019m quite within my\nrights to make him so. Not to mention\nthat, on the whole, a younger target\nmarket means simpler vocabulary, and\nthat definitely means easier reading for\nwhen I\u2019ve done far too many course-works and eaten far too little real food.\nMaybe it\u2019s not time to grow up and\nlet go of things just yet, then. His Dark\nMaterials is this Christmas\u2019 obligatory\nkid-magnet for cinemas nationwide,\nand that in turn has filled tube stations,\ncoffee shops and living rooms with\nblue paperbacks of Philip Pullman\u2019s ostensibly teen-oriented books, as adults\ntry and indulge themselves in a little bit\nmore of pop culture. Not that that\u2019s a\nbad thing, and if there\u2019s one thing we\nhave to thank Rowling for, it\u2019s that people have broadened their desire to read\npast the headlines of The Sun.\nSo, we\u2019re reading His Dark Materials, we had a crack at Harry Potter and\na few of us might have even dipped\ninto Stormbreaker \u2013 although the\nbooks were so short, a dip was probably all that was needed. Where\u2019s the\nproblem?\nSomething bizarre happened as\nHarry Potter hit fame and fortune\nworldwide. \u2018Adult\u2019 covers appeared.\nThough they were no doubt fuelled by\na desire to make the book seem even\nmore accessible to adults, they engendered this sense of shame in people,\neven with the ridiculously overdone\n\u2018older\u2019 covers. They slapped this big,\ncomfy divide between what was \u2018adult\u2019\nand what was \u2018children\u2019, even though\npeople had been quite happily reading books before then, and the notion\nof age was just a method of indexing\nthem in Waterstones.\nIt\u2019s a little sad to see it now \u2013 just as\nwebecomecomfortablewiththeideaof\nexploring the gaudy, colourful sections\nof bookshops, we\u2019re suddenly told to\nwait and only read things if they come\nwith a special jacket that looks like it\nwas designed by H.R. Giger. Which is\na bit of a shame, because the wealth of\ntop-quality fiction that got exposure as\na result of Harry Potter\u2019s success \u2013 A\nSeries of Unfortunate Events, Tales of\nthe Otori, and basically anything written by Bernard Cornwell \u2013 fell by the\nwayside as soon as it reached the 18+\nmarket.\nChristmas is coming up now, and\nthat means it\u2019s a good opportunity to\nguiltlessly drop into a bookshop and\npick up something that probably isn\u2019t\naimed at you. Hence why I\u2019m writing\nthis to you whilst wearing some pleasingly tight Pokemon underwear. Some\nof these books are ludicrously cheap,\nand are guaranteed to give you just as\ngood an experience as Mikami, Richard Hammond, Dawkins or whatever\nother nonsense you\u2019re picking up because the posters tell you to.\nGo watch some Saturday morning\nkids TV, buy some Coco Pops and\nkick back with a copy of Stormbreaker.\nYou\u2019re never too old.\nSo this is basically just a blatant excuse to stick a picture of Nicole Kidman in. And some little freak\nThe Best of the Youngest\nTales of the Otori\nWe tried in vain to get you into this a\nfew weeks back \u2013 a five-book series of war-mongering,\nlove, adolescence and religion set in a Feudal Japan-like\nfictional world. Really great stuff from an author that has\na lot of experience with the culture. The first three books\ncan be picked up for the ridiculous sum of \u00a37.49 on Amazon. Please do it now.\nHis Dark Materials\nWell, it is. If you haven\u2019t read the completely insane trilogy from Pullman then hurry up before Hollywood ruins\nthe entire thing for you. In all senses of the word. It\u2019s big,\nit\u2019s (mostly) clever and it made me cry. True story. \u00a33.49\neach on Amazon.\nThe Hardy Boys\nOh come on. Come on. Okay, maybe not this one. Still\u2026\n\u00a33.50 each on Amazon. Can\u2019t go wrong. Kind of.\nNote to Amazon.com - Can we have our money now?\n\n"

Research suggests that\na moderate amount of stress can be\npositive, making us more alert, helping\nto keep us motivated, and making us\nperform better. However, if we are not\nin control over our situation then too\nmuch stress can cause illness and physical and emotional problems, including\nheadaches, upset stomach, high blood\npressure and even strokes or heart dis-ease. Stress is a well known trigger for\ndepression and stress-related medical\nproblems are becoming more and more\ncommon. In the modern world, we all\nneed to learn how to cope with stress.\nIt is therefore important to identify the\ncauses of stress in your life and try to\nminimise them.\nAll sorts of situations can cause\nstress from major life events such as\nunemployment, moving house, starting university to minor irritations such\nas feeling undervalued at work or being stuck in traffic. Sometimes there\nare no obvious causes. Some people\nseem to suffer from stress more than\nother people. These people are called\n\u2018type A\u2019 by psychologists and they tend\nto be impatient and sometimes aggres-sive. They also seem to have a higher\nincidence level of heart attacks. People\nwho abuse alcohol or drugs are also\nmore likely to suffer from stress. Some\ncommon signs of too much stress in-clude: increased irritability, experiencing many different feelings, including\nanxiety, fear, anger, frustration and\ndepression. and signs of tension, such\nas nail-biting, drinking and smoking\nmore, indigestion, loss of concentra-tion, chest pains, lack of appetite, feeling sick, constant tiredness, due to\ndifficulty getting to sleep, craving for\nfood, restlessness and a tendency to\nsweat are also signs.\nWhen you are stressed, your body\nproduces more of the so called \u2018fight or\nflight\u2019 chemicals, adrenaline and no-radrenalin, which prepare your body\nfor an emergency. Adrenaline and noradrenaline raise your blood pressure,\nmakes your heart beat faster and increase the rate at which you perspire.\nThey can also reduce your stomach\nactivity and reduce blood flow to your\nskin. Cortisol releases fat and sugar into\nyour system as well as reduces the efficiency of your immune system. Over\ntime these chemicals and the changes\nthey produce can damage your physical and mental health.\nAdrenaline and noradrenaline use\nup large amounts of vitamin C, B-vitamins, magnesium and zinc, because it\u2019s\nan emergency, they take priority over\nthe body\u2019s general use for these nutri-ents. Vitamin C and zinc are therefore\nnot sufficiently available for collagen\nproduction to make white blood cells\nto fend off infections and to keep skin\nclear. B-vitamins are not fully available for mental function and energy\nproduction. Low levels of magnesium\nmight result in headaches and raised\nblood pressure. Increased stress levels\nalso raise the amount of oxidation dam-age, which affects various body tissues.\nConstantly raised cortisol levels keep\nthe body in a \u2018catabolic\u2019 state, which\ninterferes with tissue repair which is\nimportant when exercising.\nStress can play an important role in\nthe epidemic of obesity. Obesity shows\na connection between stress factors\nand increasing cortisol. Studies show\nthat stress contributes to increased\nfood intake, since it is interfering with\nthe neuroendocrine mechanisms resulting in an increasing appetite. An\nincrease of cortisol results in an accumulation of body fat around the waist\narea.\nIf stress is causing physical symp-toms, severe distress or making it difficult for you to function as normal, it\nis worth seeing the doctor. One of the\nfirst steps to cope with stress is learning to recognise your personal signs\nand symptoms. The way you function\non a daily basis may change, or you\nmay notice a difference in your body i.e.\ntense shoulders, the way you think, or\ngeneral sense of wellbeing. Is the cause\nfor your stress a real threat? Or are you\nworried over nothing? Be proactive\nand take responsibility for your actions\nrather than passively waiting for things\nto get better. You will get an increased\nfeeling of competence and self-esteem.\nStress management will for example\nhelp you target the causes of stress in\nyour life quickly and effectively, learn\nhow better to cope with pressure, reduce stress with rational thinking, improve working relationships and how\nto live a happier, more relaxed life. This\nwill be done by changing your subcon-scious, your feelings and beliefs, increasing your sense of calm and well\nbeing, and also enable change in your\nconscious thoughts and behaviours.\nThere are several strategies that can\nhelp you deal with stress: try to identify\nthe underlying causes of your stress.\nYou may need to review your whole\nlifestyle. Eating a healthy, balanced\ndiet, rich in fruit and vegetables, keep\nsmoking and drinking at a minimum,\nlearning to be more assertive, never\ntaking on more than you know you can\ncope with, organising your time better\nto get as much done as possible, finding humour or absurdity in stressful\nsituations, talking to friends or family,\nsharing your thoughts and fears, and\ntensing and then relaxing your muscles\nstarting at the toes and working up to\nthe head and neck.\nEthos can help you manage your\nstress levels with exercise programmes,\nweight management programmes,\nstress management and life coaching\nprogrammes \u2013 pop in and speak to\nstaff member for more information.\nWeek 7 and a lot more results are in.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*4).\nOnly teams with 5 games or more will\nbe considered in the overall championship at the end of year.\nWith this week\u2019s results in, Netball 1st, Squash Men\u2019s 1st and Tennis\nMen\u2019s 2nd (this week\u2019s Team of the\nWeek) continue their unbeaten streak\nand are top of the table with 25 points\neach.

In their\nlatest match, the girls had 10 players and managed a draw aagainst St.\nGeorge\u2019s, whilst at the weekend the\ngirls managed to get a full team out\nand whoop Goldsmith\u2019s 5 \u2013 1.\nHopefully, with a full strength\nsquad, the girls will be able to produce such wins as they did at the\nweekend and work their way up the\nleague table.\nWell done ladies!\nFootball Women\u2019s 1st\nIC Ladies 2nds kick Bucks\nHockey\nImperial Ladies 2nd XI 2\nBucks Women\u2019s 1st XI 0\nAmanda Cheung\nWith only one victory under our belt\nthis season, the ladies 2\u2019s were eager\nfor some more goal pie and hopefully\nto start a new winning streak. So last\nWednesday, the team arrived at Harlington in high spirits despite the freezing weather, ready to face our brand\nnew opposition who calls themselves\nBUCKS!\nThe game started positively, with IC\nmaking most of the attacks initially,\nforcing BUCKS to defend. However,\nit wasn\u2019t long before they answered\nwith some swift counter-attacks. Nevertheless, our solid defensive wall of\nThombelina, 3 Times a Lady, Unicycle\nand Dominator performed brilliantly\nto clear any looming danger, making\nlife for Spanner relatively easy.\nThe first half ended frustratingly\nwith an empty score line as IC failed\nto convert numerous chances. After\nsome inspirational team talk from\nresident team manager Porno Fi and\nCaptain Ghostbuster as well as half\ntime oranges courtesy of Dominator,\nthe team started the second half ready\nand refreshed and as a consequence,\nscored within the first few minutes! A\nchange in the short corner routine saw\nBrownie sweep the ball past the keep-er. The game carried on with some\nsmooth passing up front between AA,\nDid you know that among the suburban streets of leafy Teddington you\ncan find the home ground of one of\nthe oldest and most successful rugby\nclubs in the country? Far less imposing\nthan England\u2019s Twickenham Stadium\nor Harlequins\u2019s Stoop, Imperial Medicals\u2019s ground on Udney Park Road\nmakes up for what it lacks in stature\nwith its rich history.\nFormerly, belonging to St. Mary\u2019s\nHospital in Paddington the ground\ncame under the custodianship of Imperial College in 1997, after the union\nof St Mary\u2019s Hospital and Charing\nCross & Westminster Hospitals Medical School to form Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine (ICSM). With the\nunion of the Medical Schools also came\nthe amalgamation of their respective\nrugby clubs (St Mary\u2019s Hospital R.F.C.\nfounded in 1865 and Charing Cross &\nWestminster Hospitals R.F.C. founded\nin 1984) to form Imperial Medicals\nRFC.\nWhilst the days since St Mary\u2019s provided a sizeable number of players to\nthe home nation\u2019s national sides are,\ndue to the advent of the professional\nJess and Ghostbuster coupled with excellent defending when necessary. Our\nhard work paid off and IC gained a few\nshort corners as the minutes of the\ngame dwindled. The ball was pushed\nout by AA to Ghostbuster who stopped\nit and fed it into the D then a superb\nstrike from Unicycle saw the ball finish\nits path at the back of the goal before\nthe final whistle was promptly blown.\nIC 2\u2019s finished the match all smiles\nand Man of the Match was awarded to\nHoover for a fantastic performance.\nA generic hockey picture\ngame, in the past (most notably; JPR\nWilliams [Wales & British Lions] and\n\u2018Tuppy\u2019 Owen-Smith [England], who\njoined the hospital with a triple blue\nfrom Oxford (cricket, rugby, box-ing) and also played cricket for South\nAfrica). Imperial Medicals can still\nboast four recent England Students\nrepresentatives and one England 7\u2019s\nrepresentative.\nCurrently the club plays its rugby\nin the BUSA Rugby Union \u2013 Premier\nDivision (South) and in RFU London\n3 (North West), just 3 tiers below the\nNational Leagues. Additionally, the\nMedicals are current holders of the\nUnited Hospitals Cup, the oldest rugby\ncompetition in the world, which they\nhave won 7 out of the last 8 years and\nthe JPR Williams Cup, played against\nImperial College, which they have won\nevery year since its inception.\nThis summer from 6th to 20th July\n2008 Imperial Medicals RFC will be\ntouring South Africa in a project combining their two main passions; rugby\nand medicine. In a packed schedule the\nclub will visit six towns, play 7 match-es, including games against the Kruger\nNational Park Rangers and Swaziland\nNational Team (followed by a recep-A medic article... finally!\ntion with the high-commissioner of\nSwaziland) and carry out humanitarian work such as: offering their medical\nservices at local clinics, helping with\nbuilding projects and coaching school\nrugby teams.\nSuch an endeavour requires financial\nsupport not only from the players involved but also sponsorship, which the\nclub is actively seeking. In addition,\na number of fund raising events have\nbeen planned including a Christmas\nBop on the last day of term \u2013 Friday\n14th December, a tour dinner, with\nHarlequins\u2019 World Cup players as\nguests, on Saturday March 1st and a\npre-tour warm up match against London South Africa at Richmond RFC.\nFurthermore, if you are attending any\nof England\u2019s home Six Nations matches look out for some of the players selling raffle tickets offering the chance to\nwin rugby memorabilia, international\nmatch tickets, weekend breaks, hampers and cases of wine.\nIf you would like more information or can support the tour through\nsponsorship or by attending the fundraising events, please contact International Tour Captain Ben Allin (bsa04@\nimperial.ac.uk).\nMedics rugby announce their forthcoming tour to South Africa\nBen Allin\nIn the last two weeks the most socially\nactive hockey club at gimperial has\nseen it all: from drunken disastrous\ndancing in Dbs to drunken disastrous\ndancing in Belushis proving its not the\nplace you go to its who you go there\nwith.\nThis aside hockey has been as active\nas ever beating the air squadron 11-3\nand George\u2019s Medics 12-1. Please let\nme take the time to point out that the\nair squadron team did have an ex England player on their side and although\nmost people (except maybe Tom ;o) )\nknow hockey is not a one man sport I\nCharlotte Atteck\nHockey\nRSM Men XI 11\nUL Air Squadron XI 3\nthought it was worth a mention.

And although I\nwasn\u2019t at the game last Sunday I hear\nthere was more of the same. The next\nfew weeks see the girls get their first\nsolo match and with Timmay and\nSteve umpiring it is sure to be a great\nfare honest clean game with no unbiased umpiring as seen in the past...

    "content": "30 felix Friday 30 November 2007\nWat\u2019s Wat in Angkor, Cambodia\nWhen I enthusiastically start raving\nto people about having visited Angkor\nWat during the summer, I discovered\nthat I was often greeted with blank,\nglazed looks, much to my disappoint-ment. It could be that I am exceedingly\ndull and this was the first time I had\nmanaged to pick up on it, but it could\nalso be that these people are just purely\nignorant. Let us go with the latter op-tion. Now I am not being judgemental\n\u2013 just a few months ago I would have\noccupied a very similar blank expression myself. The problem therefore,\nlies in the fact that it would seem that\nAngkor is just not as famous as it deserves to be. I\u2019m sure that anyone from\nSouth East Asia will read this in disbelief when I point out that Angkor is not\nso well heard of here (Hang on\u2026 considering the vast number of Singaporeans and Malaysians here at Imperial, I\nsuppose this means I\u2019m directing this\narticle to a only a small minority of the\nImperial readership. Nevermind- Keep\nreading).\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019d never heard of it \u2013 but\nhaving now visited it in all its splen-dour, it\u2019s difficult for me to understand\nand remember why it is not as internationally renowned as it should be. I\nbelieve that Angkor is just as magnificent as the Pyramids of Giza, and with\nits fame, it deserves the onslaught of\nendless tacky ornaments and posters\nin all its glory. So let me pitch Angkor\nto you.\nAngkor is a region within Cambodia, and is the name collectively given\nto the ruins and temples that made up\nthe Khmer empire which flourished\nthere from 9-15th Century AD. So\njust a bunch of rubble then? Well, it\nis true that some of the religious sites\nhave been reduced to a few bricks as\nits remains, but nobody can argue that\nwith over a thousand temples encompassing an area of over one thousand\nsquare miles, there is no religious site\nwithin the world that equals it. The\none thousand square miles means that\nemploying a friendly tuk-tuk driver for\nthe day becomes something of a ne-cessity. With this comes the inevitable\nstops to the endless shops that he is\nsubsidised by for every tourist he takes\nthere. But that rant can be saved for\nanother time.\nAngkor Wat itself is the most famous\nof the temples within Angkor, being the world\u2019s largest single religious\nmonument. This is little wonder, considering that the monument was built\nto be used at the Khmer King Suryavarman\u2019s state temple and capital city.\nAngkor Wat is masculine and proud\nin its beauty \u2013 an obvious symbol of a\nKingdom that once had power over an\nHow sunrise is supposed to look, at Angkor Wat\nTravels without my Aunt: Part 4\nTheo Georgeiou Delisle For many, the lure of the library is all\nabout the thrill of the hunt for a free\ncomputer. Times to find a computer\ninclude 11:57pm every evening and\nwhen you have your own laptop. Once\nyou have found a free computer you\nshould congratulate yourself; you are a\nchosen individual.\nNow, take out every possession\nwithin your bag and place it carefully\naround you. Remember, in the event\nof a confrontation with a student with\nan ambiguous accent these items will\nbe your safety net allowing you to substantiate your claim that you really\nwere at the computer all night. As soon\nas you have emptied your bag you are\nfree to leave your space and go to the\ncinema for the day.\nFor many however, a single free computer is not enough. Indeed on level 4\nof the library you may find a curious\nspecies who group together to social-ise during the evening. The fountain\nof their entertainment appears to be a\ncomputer game which involves superhuman clicking on the mouse while\nsimultaneously shouting. Needless to\nsay, this was somewhat distracting for\nme as I tried to complete a long and\nboring essay. Nevertheless, the game\ncontinued ceaselessly into the night\nand indeed drew in other library members who came from levels far and wide\nto gaze upon the marvel that was the\ncompetitor\u2019s index finger action (he\ndid have a lovely index finger though).\nWhen you have finished in the library\nit is time to print off all your work.\nLuckily, Imperial Construction Ltd\nhas provided you with a small square\nof plastic with which to accomplish\nthis feat. Take your library card to the\nprinter and swipe in. As you have only\nenough credit to photocopy the title of\nyour work, you need to top up your ac-count. To do this, simply answer three\nriddles and the security officer will then\nask you to complete a simple mime\nbased charade, after which you are\ngood to go. If you find that the printer\ndecides to eat your money please use\nthe red phone which provides you with\na direct line to King\u2019s College London.\n\u201cGood evening sir,\u201d\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d\n\u201cThe usual table by the window?\u201d\n\u201cYes please\u201d.\nWelcome to the library. The library\nis located north by north west of LoUD\nConstructions Ltd and is currently a\ncentre for archaeological digs centred\naround the Imperial College campus.\nOnly last week a shammy leather dating back from at least 2.15pm last\nWednesday was found near the Periodicals on Level 3, so you can imagine\nthe excitement when only yesterday\n(and that means yesterday from whatever day you are reading this) a small\npocket of quiet was located on level 7\nfor 10 minutes. Reports are sketchy at\nthe moment but a close insider (Mr. A\nWong) breathlessly informed me that\nthe quietness came quite unexpectedly\nin the middle of a shouting contest between Biochemistry and Medicine just\nafter a youtube clip about fat kangaroos had been played.\nwas that the dark blue sky was replaced\nby dark grey clouds \u2013 clearly the sun\nwas in better places that day. But sunrise or not, Angkor Wat is no less an\nimpressive feat. In fact, it is such a\nsource of national pride that Cambodia\nhas it mounted centrally in its flag. Perhaps we too, should take more pride in\nour heritage sites and consider putting\nStonehenge on our flag.\nAngkor Wat may have been the temple with the most grandeur, but I would\nnot have chosen it as my favourite tem-ple. Preah Khan had an extra special\natmosphere about it \u2013 how many temples can boast of having parts of a jungle which have grown and intertwined\nwithinitsarchitectureoverhundredsof\nyears? Tomb Raider fans will, of course,\nextensive area of South East Asia. Our\nbest friend Lonely Planet informed us\nthat watching the sunrise over Angkhor Wat at 5am was something that\nwas a necessity. So, after about 2 hours\nof sleep (watching Wimbledon tennis can be surprisingly addictive, even\nwhilst travelling), with excitement\ndampening down that sick feeling one\nhas with too little sleep, we eagerly set\noff to watch the sun rise to illuminate\nthe sight of the greatest religious monument there is.\nWe arrived to see Angkor Wat surrounded by a rather gloomy, oppressive\ndark blue sky and waited for a brilliant\nbright light to shine upon the scene (it\nis religious, after all). And waited. And\nwaited some more. All that happened\nrecognise Preah Khan, where many of\nthe scenes were shot for the film. This\nwas the temple which stood out for\nme, but many of the smaller temples\nalso left a lasting impression. Set within dark, dense, humid forests- often\nwith no tourists within sight, they had\nan eerie, haunting beauty about them\nwhich reminds you of how time passes,\ncausing a kingdom that once was to be\nreduced to ruins.\nIt is difficult to write about Angkor\nwithout delving into the social and\npolitical strife that has ransacked the\ncountry of Cambodia in recent years,\nbut I feel this deserves attention in its\nown right. (As in\u2026 prepare yourself for\nanother Felix article about Cambodia)\nHowever, the aftermath of what has\noccurred in Cambodia seeps through\nas a reminder, even in the most tourist-orientated of places such as Angkor.\nIt is impossible to visit any temple\nwithout being surrounded by about\nten, bedraggled children, all doe-eyed,\nshoeless and eager to sell you bracelets\nwhilst telling you (in perfectly formed\nEnglish that they are taught locally for\nthe purpose of local economy i.e. harassing us tourists) that $1 for a bracelet\nis a lot for them, and not a lot for us.\nFor any moral guidance as to what one\nshould do, I refer you to Ahran\u2019s article\nlast week concerning Tiny Tim.\nYou could compare Angkor to Rome,\nin that both are representative of kingdoms that once ruled proudly. But unlike Rome, there was something of a\nsad quality about Angkor \u2013 whereas\nRome still acts as a pinnacle within arts\nand literature today, the recent events\nin Cambodia made Angkor seem like\na symbol of how a country can decline\nfrom becoming a great kingdom into\nthe unstable state that it is currently\nin.\nI would argue that this made visiting\nAngkor all the more a poignant experi-ence, and urge you to see for yourself\nwhy the Cambodians present Angkor\nWat with such pride on their national\nflag.\nComputer claimed, off to the cinema we go!\nOne thousand temples spread over one thousand square miles \u2013 it\u2019s surprising Angkor is not more famous\nNadine Richards\nTravel Editor\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editors \u2013 Ahran Arnold and Nadine Richards\n\n"

The curtain of\ngrey mist and wind-blown water was\ntwitched aside, and suddenly we were\nstanding on the plateau crest, beneath\na fantastic sunny sky, looking out over\nthe Dark Peak region which makes up\nthe northern half of the Peak District.\nElated, we celebrated with lunch and a\ngroup photo before turning south, descending back into the valley towards\nthe Mam Tor \u2013 Back Tor ridge which\nmarks the southern limit of Edale. In\ncontrast to the wild, remote landscape\nof Kinder Scout, the floor of Edale valley is covered in picturesque farmland,\ncriss-crossed by footpaths.

Although\nnot particularly high, topping out at\n517 metres, the route up is a steep one.\nSteeper for some than others, in fact, as\nNick, Anna, Gareth, and Julia got bored\nfollowing the path, and cut straight up\nthe mountainside \u2013 a technique known\nas \u2018Scottish Navigation\u2019. The rest of us,\nopting for the less strenuous route, met\nthem at the top of the tor, which was\ncovered by the remains of an Iron Age\nhillfort. Passing along the ridge, Martin and Melissa headed down early to\nthe minibus, while the rest of us took a\nshort detour to the top of Back Tor, for\nsome gorgeous views and a few photo-graphs. After that, it was back to the\ncamping barn for supper and a trip to\nthe local pub, where Julia did her best\nto show everyone how drinking games\nare played back in Aachen.\nSunday morning was a beautiful one,\nwith an eight thirty lie-in to ease a few\nsore heads from the night before. The\nonly bum note was Gareth\u2019s discovery\nthat his water bottle had leaked during the night, soaking the floorboards\nand the end of Yvonne\u2019s sleeping bag.\nYvonne was unconcerned, however,\nand we soon had the minibus packed\nand were on our way south towards\nthe High Peak Trail, which follows\nthe roadbed of a disused railway. The\ntrail provided easy walking though\nthe morning, with a lunch break on\nHarboro Rocks, which, thanks to the\nexposed crags on it\u2019s southern face,\nwas covered with climbers. After a bit\nof scrambling, we turned off the trail,\nmaking a loop down towards Carsington Water before returning to the start\nof the walk and the road to London.

That\u2019s dog crap\nFelix loves its readers and doesn\u2019t want to see you fooled into tucking into sub-standard curries. That\u2019s why\nthis week, David Stewart gives us the skinny on where to get an authentic Indian experience in London\nHere\u2019s a delicious dish for you all to try unless, of course, you\u2019re chicken!\n\u201cT\nhat tears it,\u201d I\nscreamed. \u201cIt\u2019s your\nproblem if you want\nto shove the devil\u2019s\nshit down your gullet but don\u2019t drag innocents into your\nsordid affairs.\u201d My quite reasonable\noutburst occurred when I heard someone explaining in oh-so-authoritative\ntones how \u2018if one wants a really authentic Indian experience, one goes to\nBrick Lane.\u2019\nIt\u2019s a funny word: \u2018authentic\u2019, used almost exclusively to denote something\nwhich is as far from what it claims\nto be as possible; it\u2019s a word which is\nspecifically directed at tourists to suggest to them that they are getting the\n\u2018real deal\u2019 as opposed to a substandard\nproduct. \u2018Authentic Indian Cuisine\u2019 is\nprobably as bad as it gets. India is huge.\nThere is no such thing as Indian Cuisine - there are such things as Punjabi\nCuisine, Gujarati Cuisine, Rajasthani\nCuisine and so forth, although \u2018cuisine\u2019\nitself is a ludicrous word when \u2018cooking\u2019 would do just as well.\nBrick Lane has not changed much\nsince about 1970 when the local Bangladeshi community started putting up\nrestaurants to feed London with anglicised versions of the Punjabi dishes\nit had encountered in the days of the\nRaj. Very quickly, England realised that\nit preferred Chicken Tikka Masala to\nLamb chops and Bisto; well there\u2019s no\nsurprise there, it probably was rather\nbetter, but standards haven\u2019t improved\nsince then. We still seem to queue up\nto sit down in high back chairs on thick\npile carpet heavy with the stench of old\nfood chugging down tasteless watered\ndown lager and chomping poppadoms\nwith sauces from jars. And then the\nfood.\nHere\u2019s how to cook a curry in a restaurant in Brick Lane: take a handful\nof defrosted then pre-cooked chicken\nbreast, a ladelful of carcinogenic curry\npaste that you\u2019ve bought at Makro and\nhalf a pot of cream. Heat it all up and\nserve with a handful of coriander on\nthe top.\nIf it\u2019s not obvious, let me explain how\nwrong this is: (a) a curry is supposed to\nbe a slow cooked dish where the aromatic flavours of the spices have sufficient time to impregnate the meat, (b)\nchicken leg is better than breast when\ncooked slowly as its texture softens instead of hardening. (c) curry pastes are\nsaturated with vinegar and preservatives and every possible ingredient\nunder the sun instead of well chosen,\nfreshly ground spices.\nWhat\u2019s the solution? Excellent outlets serving specialised Indian food in\nLondon do exist. Tooting is the closest\nIndian community to the centre and\nhas great Sri Lankan (= Ceylon) food.\nThe BYO policies mean you can end up\nspending less than a tenner a head for\nmore than you could possibly finish. A\ngreat bet is Apollo Banana Leaf, though\nRhada Krishna Bhavan is pretty good\ntoo. There are also excellent places\ndotted around town. More Sri Lankan\nfood can be found at the very cheap Sagar (vegetarian) in Hammersmith.\nAt (your parents\u2019) great expense you\ncan enjoy contemporary indian food at\nBenares in Mayfair where Atul Kochha\nbrandishes a Michelin star, or there\u2019s\nthe Red Fort in Soho for a Moglai feast\nor High Street Kensington\u2019s Zaika is a\ngreat venue.\nIn the mid-range I love the seafood\nat Rasa Samudra on Charlotte street,\nbut for Wagamama\u2019s style pricing the\nbest options in London are Chowki on\nDenman St, Masala Zone in Islington/\nSoho/Covent Garden/Earl\u2019s Court,\nor Imli on Wardour Street. All these\nthree offer pan-indian options, usually\nas a Thali (a sort of mixed selection)\nwith vibrant fresh spicing and a good\ndoff of the hat to the dishes\u2019 respective regions of origin. There really is\nno need to shovel the devil\u2019s shit down\nyour gullet.\nThere has been a recent convergence of roast chicken thought\naround recipes similar to this\none. Some of the latest and most\nrespected cook books out there\nprescribe very similar processes,\nfor example Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s River Cottage Meat\nBook, and Simon Hopkinson\u2019s\nRoast Chicken and other stories.\nI believe this represents the to-date accumulated wisdom regarding this timeless classic, and\nso I\u2019m calling it cutting edge. It\u2019s\na very resilient beast, and could\neasily be done with just chicken,\nbutter, a lemon and white wine,\nso chop and change ingredients\nat will. I\u2019ve given directions in\norder that include the roast po-tatoes, so this ought to set you\nup for your first roast, if you can\nmanage the veg.\nIngredients\nFor the chicken:\nA chicken!\n100g Butter\n2 cloves Garlic\nThyme (or whatever herbs you\nhave to hand)\nOne lemon\nSalt and Pepper\nFor the roast potatoes:\nVersatile white potatoes (King\nEdwards often suggested)\nGoose fat or sunflower oil for\nroasting\nInstructions\n1) Set the oven to 220 degrees\n2) Peel potatoes, and get a full kettle boiling. Chop them into golf ball\nsize bits and boil in a well salted\npan for 8 minutes (from when they\nstart to boil). NB They should cook\nnearly all the way through, and you\ncan feel for this with a knife.\n3) While potatoes are cooking,\nprepare the chicken:\na. Get rid of the string on it.\nb. Cut off excess fat around the\ncavity\nc. Mash the garlic with some salt\nand a fork, and mix with the butter (soften in a microwave), pepper\nand herbs (remove thyme leaves\nfrom stalks).\nd. Rub the butter mix all over the\nchicken, inside and out\ne. Place breast up in a neat fitting\ntray (not too big)\nf. Cut the lemon in half and place\ninside the cavity\n4) Drain potatoes and place on a\nboard, well spaced out to cool\n5) Place the chicken in the middle of the oven to give it 20 mins at\n220. Place a tray for the potatoes at\nthe top of the oven, with fat a few\nmillimetres deep in the bottom of it\n\u2013 it needs to heat up before adding\nthe potatoes, which should fit with\nample space.\n6) Scratch the surfaces of the\ncooled potatoes with a fork, and\nsprinkle with salt.\nCutting Edge Roast\nChicken\nNoel Forrest\n7) Turn the oven down to 180,\ntake out the hot fat tray and add the\npotatoes, spooning fat over them\nthoroughly. Also at this stage, add\na small glass of white wine to the\nchicken pan.\n8) The chicken will need another 40-60 mins depending on\nits size (1.4 kg is small, 1.8kg is\nbig), HOWEVER, this timing is a\nkey adjustment. You are aiming\nfor two things: firstly a crisp skin\nall over, and secondly lots of nice\nburnt sludgey bits at the bottom of\nthe pan. I can\u2019t overestimate how\nimportant they are for gravy, so if\nthese things haven\u2019t happened,\ngive it longer. Adding too much\nwine can ruin this also. If you\u2019re\nworried it\u2019s under done, make a cut\nwhere the leg meets the breast \u2013\nany hint of red in the juices and it\nneeds longer.\n9) When you are happy with\ncrispy skin and burnt sludge, take\nout the chicken, tilt it to spill its\njuice into the tray. Remove it from\nits tray and let it rest on a board for\n15 mins while you make the veg.\n10) Turn the potatoes in the fat\nand whack up the heat to finish\nthem off and get them crispy.\n11) Also at this stage you make\nthe gravy. Take the chicken tray\nall gungey and burnt looking, and\nplace it on the heat. Add another\nsplash of white wine and scrape\nall the magical residues loose with\na wooden spoon. Judgement and\nconstant tasting come in here\u2026 a\nfew pointers:\na. If there\u2019s not enough liquid,\nadd some boiling water from the\nveg (but a little concentrated flavour is better in general)\nb. Squeezings from the lemon in\nthe chicken may work\nc. A dab of redcurrant jelly too.\nd. If you\u2019re lacking in flavour, or\nneed to increase volume, then gravy granules are definitely acceptable (unless you want to make a\nstock reduction meat glaze\u2026 didn\u2019t\nthink so!)\ne. Gravy granules will thicken,\nbut if not needed then slake a\nteaspoon of cornflour in a mug\nwith cold water (avoids lumps)\nbefore whisking in.\n12) Carve and serve.\nI think there are too many variables to control here to be precise\nabout the recipe, which is why\nI\u2019ve emphasised use of judge-ment. That\u2019s the real fun of cooking anyway.\nNow boys and girls here\u2019s a quick test to see if you\u2019ve been paying attention. Which would you rather have?\nWarning: The ink used to print this paper is not suitable for\ningestion. Please do not lick the page.\n\n"

While perhaps\nnot quite of the same grandeur of the\nRoyal Albert Hall, the Concert Hall at\nthe Barbican is nothing short of im-pressive. The seats are well-arranged\ntoo, with a clear and unobstructed\nview of the entire orchestra.\nTonight\u2019s programme consists of\nTishchenko\u2019s Cello Concerto No. 1, followed by Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 6 in\nA minor, with a 20-minute interval between the two pieces.\nThe Concerto is performed by Tim\nHugh, an international soloist as well\nas the Principal Cellist of the London\nSymphony Orchestra. He studied cello\nunder Aldo Parisot while at Yale and\nlater with William Pleeth and the great\nJacqueline du Pr\u00e9 while at St. Johns\nCollege, Cambridge.\nHugh has also worked as soloist with\nmany great conductors including Previn, Sir Colin Davis, Rostropovich,\nMenuhin, Xavier-Roth, Chung and\nTortelier. He has recently toured the\nUK playing the Elgar and Brahms Concertos with the Moscow Philharmonic\nand in Spain with the LSO at Alhambra\nPalace. Hugh plays on a cello by Petrus\nRoman of Venice 1708.\nMahler\u2019s Symphony No. 6, nicknamed\n\u2018The Tragic\u2019 will be performed by the\nLSO, with Valery Gergiev at the helm.\nBorn in Moscow, Gergiev studied conducting at the Leningrad Conservatory\nand at the age of 24, won the Herbert\nvon Karajan Conductor\u2019s Competition in Berlin. Gergiev is the Artistic\nand General Director of the Mariinsky\nTheatre and has toured in 45 countries\nwith the Kirov Opera, Ballet and Orchestra. In 2003, Gergiev led a considerable portion of St. Petersburg\u2019s 300th\nanniversary celebrations, conducted\nthe globally televised anniversary gala,\nand opened the Carnegie Hall season\nwith the Kirov Orchestra, being the\nfirst Russian conductor to do so since\nTchaikovsky conducted the first-ever\nconcert in Carnegie Hall. Gergiev is\ncurrently the Principal Conductor of\nthe LSO.\nIt is worth noting at this point that\nthe choice of repertoire for tonight\u2019s\nconcert doesn\u2019t cater particularly well\nto the more \u2018casual\u2019 listener of classical music; the Tishchenko, in particu-lar, whereas Mahler\u2019s work is generally\nakin to Marmite; you either love it, or\ncan\u2019t stand it.\nThe Tishchenko starts out with a\nlong monologue on the cello, where the\ncomposer\u2019s admiration for his teacher\nShostakovich is evident and where\nthe tone of the entire piece is set. The\nmusic starts off with an anxious, dis-cordant, and uneasy feel. This is further emphasised when the orchestra\nis introduced, gradually increasing\nin energy and intensity, before slowly\nsubsiding away towards the end. The\ninsistent, repeated four-note motif and\nthe brooding, jarring passages all serve\nto create an atmosphere of suspense\nand unease. The solo writing is fan-tastic; with every register and characteristic of the cello exploited and Tim\nHugh puts on a fine performance, full\nof enthusiasm and energy.\nAfter the interval, the audience and\nmusicians take their seats, and I am\nslightly surprised (even by Mahler\nstandards) by the size of the orchestra;\ntwo timpanis, cowbells, a celesta, two\nharps, nine horns and a hammer! And\nnot just some Stanley job, but a ludicrously proportioned mallet, straight\nout of an ACME catalogue of a \u2018Loony\nTunes\u2019 cartoon. This is most definitely\nnot your average set-up.\nThe first movement is intense and\nmarch-like, with conflicting demands\nof tempo that Gergiev handles with the\nutmost ease, making it seem easy and\nnatural. Alma\u2019s theme, which reoccurs\nthroughout the entire Symphony, is introduced to the audience. The second\nmovement is slower, more emotional\nand yet full of turmoil, with nasty,\ncomplex rhythms that are dealt with by\nGergiev once again.\nIn the third movement, things begin\nto get darker, more brooding and men-acing, building up towards the final\nmovement. The fourth is tragic, pow-erful, and emotional. I had never before heard the fourth movement played\nwith such energy, intensity and ferocity as I did that night, like witnessing a\nwild beast caged for the first time.

    "content": "31\nFriday 30 November 2007 felix\nDinosaurs, food, bonding and rocks\nThe De La Beche society\u2019s Tim Chalk and Steph Wilk report on their intrepid journey to the Isle of Wight\nE\nrasmus is awesome. Fact.\nOnce you understand this,\nyour life will be much improved and will lead to a\ngreater state of happiness,\npossibly even a Zen-like state of perpetual nirvana. Either that or you will\nwake up with a hangover the size of a\ncontinent. Which continent I hear you\nask (slightly perplexed and perhaps\nstrangely aroused by the paper this fine\narticle is printed on)? Why, Europe of\ncourse!\nErasmus is the rather contrived acronym for the \u201cEuropean Community\nAction Scheme for the Mobility of\nUniversity Students\u201d. The governments\nof the member nations give money to\nstudents so they can move to a different university in another European\ncountry for a year and get well and\ntruly battered in the name of educa-tion. The unofficial nickname for the\nscheme amongst its participants is Orgasmus, which surely shouldn\u2019t need\nmuch explanation (unless you study\nComputing).\nSaturday the 27th of October is a\ndate that will go down in history, not\nbecause Gordon Brown announced he\nwas going to run away with the milk-man, but because it was the date that\nthe Erasmus Society held its European\nWelcome Party. Gordon would probably have been happy at the lack of\npublicity.\nWith free beer to draw in the early\npunters, dB\u2019s filled up pretty quickly.\nBy the end of the night, there were\nsomewhere around 250-300 chaps\nand chap-ettes having the time of their\nlives. It was strategically (i.e. acciden-tally) arranged to coincide with the\nC&G dinner and the Club managed\nto sell about 100 memberships on the\ndoor, doubling the total membership\nof the club in one fine evening.\nThe pivotal factor in attracting people in was undoubtedly the quality of\nthe two DJs spinning the tunes that\nnight.\nFlorent Daubigney, one of the visiting\nErasmus guys himself, had no trouble\nin keeping the crowd smiling all night\nwith his great dance floor friendly\nblend of house seeing as he has wowed\ncrowds of more than 2,500 at his university in Lyon. The vibes were so good,\neven Sir Richard Sykes would have got\nup and shaken his bootay had he been\nthere. Which of course he wasn\u2019t. But\nhe would\u2019ve. And Margaret Thatcher\nwould\u2019ve. But she wasn\u2019t there either,\nthankfully.\nAlso knocking out the sound was IC\ngraduate extraordinaire, Nathan Alliston. He played a range of commercial\nhip-hop and juicy R&B beats, hinting\nat his previous sets at Embargos and\nCrazy Larry\u2019s, which of course went\nT\nhis term\u2019s DLB trip was\nto the lovely Isle of Wight\nwhich as everyone knows\nhas its own language, time\nzone and currency. The\nmix of seniors and freshers on the trip\nallowed for some top class bonding\nover our favourite past-time: looking\nat, and talking about rocks.\nWhen we arrived, a trip to Morrisons was called for to sample the first\nof their fine dinners and stock up on\nvarious bits and bobs. This was followed by a trip to the dinosaur museum which was very empty, allowing us\nto run around, dig up bones, have fun\nand acquire some brilliant souvenirs\nbut most importantly learn about di-nosaurs. After that we made ourselves\nat home in Winchester House which\nwas definitely the nicest youth hostel\nI\u2019ve ever seen.\nHaving eaten some of our fish and\nchips over a game of \u2018Ho Down\u2019 or two\nwe prepared for a night out at Bogey\u2019s,\nordering a convoy of taxis. Apparently\nin Isle of Wight language that\u2019s not a\nreally shit name but actually quite\ncool. On Saturday we headed off to\nMorrisons for meal two, personally I\nrecommend the chicken tikka. We all\nfinished the night in different states of\ndisrepair, depending on when you returned to the hostel \u2013 some a lot earlier\nthan others.\nWe then spent the day in the centre\nof the huge fold that comprises most of\nthe island. Not actually in the rock you\nunderstand, but on the exposed bits\nalong the beach. During luncheon two\nathletic young alpha males went for a\ndip in the sea (this then meant they\nthought it appropriate to spend the\nremainder of the trip naked and hence\nthey still haven\u2019t found their penises).\nThe day ended with a look at some real\ndinosaur foot prints, minus one that\nhad been chain-sawed out of the rock.\nWe would never steal anything like\nthat (way too heavy). As a warning: be\ncareful of the locals, apparently on the\nIsle of Wight they don\u2019t agree with scientific exploration, especially at Poom.\nSaturday was completed with a\nlovely formal homemade dinner in\nthe evening, cooked by four fabulous\npests (no guesses where we got the\nfood from). The dinner was delicious\n\u2013 people were saying it was their best\nspaghetti bolognaise ever, some loved\nit so much they couldn\u2019t help but drink\nit for pudding. A 19th birthday was\ncelebrated with a rather interesting\ndisplay of the human body and a gentle\nmidnight swim.\nOn our journey home some local\nknowledge pointed us in the direction\nof an amazing roast dinner which sent\nthe majority into a contented sleep.\nThe trip was great, everyone bonded,\nsome perhaps a bit too much, and I\u2019d\nlike to thank the organisers for their\nhard work and Shell for their generous sponsorship on behalf of everyone.\nCan\u2019t wait for the next one!\nDe La Beche society considers where to take its dinosaur search next Best.

He thinks you will too once you\u2019ve read about their recent get-together\ndown an absolute treat: thank you very\nmuch, vicar.\nAll-in-all, the Erasmus welcome party went absolutely spiffingly and you\nare whole-heartedly invited to the next\nevent.

I hope it won\u2019t be up for much longer though\nIt started so well: \u201cPresenting a clear,\nconsistent image of the College to raise\nits profile worldwide is key to making\nfirst impressions lasting impressions.\u201d\nYet anyone who\u2019s read Imperial\u2019s\nown guide to making a poster using\nan Imperial College PowerPoint template will know that some of the advice\nwhich follows this peppy introduction\nis highly suspect.\nLet me say at the outset that I have\nno quibbles with the purpose of the\ntemplate itself, nor of the guide. I recently came across this webpage precisely because I was looking for an Imperial template to use on a poster, as I\nbelieve that used well, these templates\ncan make a poster highly effective. Not\nonly has a huge amount of care clearly\nbeen put into getting the look of these\ntemplates right, but by using these\ntemplates, one confers some of Imperial\u2019s considerable reputation upon\noneself, purely by association.\nThis may be slightly sneaky, but it\npales in comparison with the guide\u2019s\nsuggestions for undesirable data.\nAfter some useful tips on what col-our, background, and typeface to use\nwhen raising our profile, the guide\nproffers some advice on how to display\ndata in graphic form. And it is here that\nthis otherwise inoffensive and helpful\ndocument reveals a deeply cynical and\nunscientific attitude. When discussing\ntables, it makes the very valid point\nthat they can lack visual impact \u2013 that\nif one wishes to highlight large differences in the data, a bar chart is much\nmore effective. Yet it then goes on to\nsuggest that one should therefore employ a table if one wishes to \u201cdownplay\u201d\nthe very same differences, as the table\n\u201cwill display the same information in a\nless dramatic way\u201d.\nThis is undoubtedly true, but is disingenuous at best on a page aimed at\nscientists, as it represents a travesty of\nthe scientific spirit. Surely any advice\nby Imperial to us, its staff and students,\non how to present our data should tell\nus how to do this as lucidly as possible,\nnot how to obfuscate. Furthermore,\nbear in mind that this webpage is accessible to the wider public \u2013 do we\nwish to present a clear, consistent image of ourselves as dissemblers?\nA jaded student might conclude that\nthis is one of the vaunted transferable\nskills needed when winging off into the\nwild blue corporate yonder, and regret-tably, this may well be the case. After\nall, the example the author clearly had\nin mind was the use of data with an associated agenda \u2013 he or she may think\nthis little sleight-of hand entirely natural in a commercial or political context\nsay, and never have considered using it\non scientific data.\nYet, as events at Bell Labs and Seoul\nNational University in recent years\nhave shown, scientific data holds no\ninherent truth \u2013 it is only the intellectual honesty of scientists which gives\nit the value we, and society, place in it.\nJan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n and Hwang WooSuk were quite rightly pilloried for debasing the gold standard by fabricating\ndata in published research on organic\nelectronics and human cloning respec-tively. This is an extreme end of the\nspectrum of scientific misconduct, but\nany scientist at Imperial who follows\nthe tips on our own website too closely\nis well on the way to sharing Sch\u00f6n and\nHwang\u2019s fate.\nHere\u2019s a thought: if this webpage\nindicates that the more corporate elements of Imperial hold a laxer attitude\nto data than is permissible amongst its\nscientists, maybe the former should\nraise their standards to match the profile they cherish so; a profile which\nmany of us work hard to uphold. After\nall, what\u2019s sauce for the goose\u2026\nDo our competition!\n\n"

It should have no\nstart or finish; just like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many lines\nshould be drawn around it, for example:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number can be\nsurrounded by any number of lines.\nRemember, the line must form a loop, so\nthe line cannot branch. The following situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There are\nnever cells containing the number 4 in\nSlitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most common place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by\ndrawing crosses around any zeros. Drawing\ncrosses is purely done to so that you know\nwhere there can\u2019t possibly be a line. So, take\nthe pattern below as an example. Begin by\ndrawing crosses, then by filling in some\nlines:\nNow the lines can only continue in the following directions:\nYeah, we realised that we printed the answer\nto last week\u2019s Slitherlink in the same issue.\nsudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nFriday 30 November 2007 felix\nFun & Games\nLogic Puzzle: Colourful Lecturers\nUsing the clues and logical deduction\nalone, work out how all the people\ninvolved in the match relate to each\nother.

Missing the debauchery of summer? Aren\u2019t we\nall. Often it is one of the\nhigh points of anyone\u2019s year,\netched in the memory for eons and\nrecounted at bars and gatherings end-lessly. Afterall, we are a travel-obsessed\nnation. Perhaps it says more about us\nand our current state than we\u2019d care to\nmention, but we love little more than\nspending half the year thinking about\nthe trip, a little less than the next half\nplanning it and then actually taking off\nand going for the rest of it.\nWe all have our ideal trips \u2013 the city\nbreak, the backpacking adventure or\nthe overland odyssey, but more often\nthan not we just don\u2019t find the time\nto get up and go. A pithy alternative,\nperhaps, but escape is still attainable in\nthe form of film, music and of course,\nliterature. The books here have been\nchosen for their common theme and\nvary wildly between epics that we all\ndream of, such as travelling the roads\nof the Americas, awakenings and emotionally turbulent trips and gargantuan\nvoyages through the afterlife. We hope\nyou like.\nAlex Garland \u2013 The Beach\nEach generation searches for its\nShangri-La. Although the islands of\nThailand have since lost much of their\nvirginal allure in the eyes of incessant\n\u201cexplorers\u201d, back when Garland wrote\nThe Beach they were still relatively untouched by the package-tour brigade.\nTat from elitist spiritual pretenders\naside, The Beach almost perfectly captures one of the desires found in so\nmany of our generation \u2013 the sometimes overwhelming desire to travel,\nwander the earth, to keep moving and\ndiscover a little slice of heaven for our-selves, and for ourselves alone.\nThe Beach charts the story of Richard, a young British backpacker \u2013Garland when he was \u201c18 or 19\u201d \u2013 who\ntravels through Thailand to find a\nUtopian community on one of the islands after being given a map by Daffy,\na crazed and older traveller who has\nbeen around too long and seen too\nmuch. On one level an engaging ad-venture, and on another asking questions about the inherent unrest and\ndestructive nature of backpackers like\nRichard, The Beach is a fine addition to\nthe pantheon of literary wanderers.\nDante Alighieri \u2013 The Divine\nComedy\nThis is not your typical travel novel\ninvolving a road-trip, given, but for\nscope and depth alongside sheer scale\nand imagination, travelling through the\ncircles of Hell from Purgatory and into\nParadise takes some beating. Contrary\nto popular belief, reviewers do sometimes read what they write about.\nI can\u2019t say I remember all of it \u2013\nsomething about not resting on downy\nplumes and something about a subliminal passage that if you understand,\nyou\u2019re amazing, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re\nretarded \u2013 but in essence it tracks the\ntravels of Dante, the Luke to Virgil\u2019s\nBen Kinobe, through Hell, watching sinners burn and get all sorts of\ntwisted stuff done to them (it\u2019s worth it\njust for this) before popping by Satan\u2019s\nplace to say \u201cHi\u201d while he chews on Judas\u2019 face, then emerging to the stars in\nPurgatory.\nHe climbs the mountain of Purgatory before reaching the gate, passing\nthrough and ascending the terraces of\nPurgatory while watching nice folks being purged of their sins. Virgil departs\nand Dante hooks up with Beatrice (the\nLove of his life and BFF) and then they\nascend into the spheres of Heaven\nbefore meeting Jesus, Mary and God,\nwhom grants him understanding of\nhuman and divine nature.\nThere\u2019s a lot of dry, Florentine politics in this book. It is seen to be of importance as it shaped the West\u2019s perception of \u201cHell\u201d whilst also being key\nto the evolution of the Italian language,\nbut other than that, and being really,\nreally long, I can\u2019t think of anything\nmore worthy of the title \u201ctrophy book\u201d.\nOther than War and Peace, of course.\nErnesto Guevara \u2013 The Motorcycle\nDiaries\nEloquent and colourful, The Motorcycle Diaries are the recollections of\na young Ernesto Guevara who, at the\nage of 23, packed up his medical studies and decided he needed to see more\nof the world. Travelling with his friend\nAlberto and his trusty steed La Ponderosa, a 500cc Norton motorcycle, getting shit-faced and picking up women\nwas always on the agenda, but along\nthe way it is interesting to watch his\nincreasing sentiment towards the people of the Lands he visits \u2013 a forgotten\nleper colony in Argentina or a Chilean copper mine which had already\nclaimed numerous victims.\nGuevara takes much at surface level\nand tells it so matter-of-factly that one\nbegins to believe it all to be entirely\nnormal. Likened to a more focused and\n(slightly more) sober On The Road, it\ndoes for South America what Kerouac\ndid for its Northern counterpart.\nHunter S. Thomson \u2013 Fear and\nLoathing in Las Vegas\nI remember reading an interview with\nBrian Molko from Placebo who, after\nreading Marilyn Manson\u2019s book Long\nHard Road Out Of Hell, stated happily\nthat it made him want to go out an do\nas many drugs and get as \u201cfucked up\u201d\nas he possibly could. Can\u2019t say that was\nmy reaction after reading Fear and\nLoathing, but it has that effect on some\npeople. So I\u2019m told. Repeatedly.\nFear and Loathing is the based-on-a-true-story account of Thompson and a friend\u2019s long, drug-fuelled\nbender-cum-road adventure in Vegas\nwhile on assignment for Sports Illustrated. Living out the last days of the\nfervent counterculture of the time, the\nnovel follows their hallucinations and\ndragged-out trips, ultimately culminating in inevitable paranoia and a ragged\nmutual mistrust.\nLambasting the American Dream\nand its ultimate futility, as well as\nchronicling the optimism-turned-cyn-Of all the places Kerouac wrote about and romanticised, it is perhaps his recollections of the California coast that are the most inspiring\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n\n"

The eccentricity of his character\nmatched with the extremity of the surrounding he has returned to time and\ntime again show up (debatably) his\nbest fictional work. In fact, had it not\nbeen for his two Amazon-based tales,\nAguirre, Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo, the legend of Werner Herzog\nwould not be nearly as far-fetched as it\ncurrently stands.\nIf ever fear and awe went hand in\nhand, it is probably the moment at\nwhich an agent tells their actor that\nHerzog has been on the phone. The\nNew German Cinema alumnus has a\nreputation for authenticity beyond the\ncall of duty that would make anyone on\nthe other end of the line hesitate. The\nlong time recipient of Herzog\u2019s tirades,\nKlaus Kinski, would certainly testify to\nthe sadistic tendencies of the auteur.\nAguirre, the first of five collaborations between the two, saw the director\ntake his crew rafting down the Amazon\nunder such deprived conditions that\nKinski threatened to walk out, at which\npoint Herzog threatened to shoot him\non the spot. Thankfully for both of\ntheir reputations, which were\nthen only in the process of\nbeing formed, Kinski\nknew when he was\nbeaten and decided\nto stay. I\u2019ll bet the\ncurrently striking\nWriters Guild in\nthe States is glad\nthe powers that\nbe with them\ndon\u2019t have such\nballs.\nAguirre is\nprobably the\nbest film to show\nHerzog\u2019s willingness to lose himself in the\nA penchant for perfection has long been the hallmark of Werner Herzog\u2019s work but,\nunlike the conscientious office proofreader, he\u2019s willing to move mountains for it\nAlex Casey\nA\nmongst the vitriolic spirit that Felix has acquired\nof late, I have found my\nperfectly content existence to be unnervingly\npleasant. The sun has set on the summer of shit cinema and the festival lead\nthe way in consecrating the aisles of\nthe multiplex once more to the point\nthat I have been criticised (yes, me!)\nof being overly generous with reviews.\nWell fuck you, but after sitting through\nthree months of shite during the holi-days, when I actually have time to\nmake the most of my unlimited pass,\nhalf-hearted fare like Lions for Lambs\nis enough to leave a small wet patch\non the cinema seat by the time the 3rd\nMusic Supervisor rolls past in the end\ncredits\nBut, hoorah, just when you think life\nis beautiful again, something worse\nthan even Pirates of the Carribean XVII\nlands in your lap and you realise what\nis wrong with this false consciousness\nyou have conjured: bloody gangsters.\nNot in the sense that they will get my\nkids hooked on heroin or mow down\nmy business with an uzi, but that they\u2019ll\nspend a good three hours boring me to\ndeath. A cunning plan indeed.\nRidley Scott, where did it all go\nwrong? Perhaps two decades of Blade\nRunner bashing got to him before he\ngot the chance to release his own masterpiece edit of the classic and it seems\nthat, since then, he just falls at every\nhurdle. Hannibal, Kingdom of Heaven and A Good Year didn\u2019t exactly set\nthe world alight and God knows why\nGladiator did. Now he delivers American Gangster and there\u2019s a good buzz\nstonger than the average Rampant\nRabbit. Bizarrely, this seems to always\nbe the case for these mobster stories.\nGangster films formulaically provide\n20 minutes of weak orgasmic release\nduring a final shootout fluffed up with\nalmost three hours of robotic foreplay\nand a five minute denouement reminiscent of those fresher Sunday mornings\nwith the beer-goggled/badly-judged/\nill-remembered pull that beggars the\nquestion \u201cWhy did I do this again?\u201d.\nI say formulaic, I mean pretty much\nidentical.\nLet\u2019s throw in large family with a slice\nof Shakespearean betrayal, dress up a\npretty lady to be the hard done-by moll,\nsprinkle with a generous helping of\ncrack or smack and then inject a downpour of bullets. Horror films at least\ntry and put a spin on their checklists\nin the postmodern age that Wes Craven\u2019s Scream heralded. Yet it is crime\ncinema that seems to hold the ultimate\nrespect for critics everywhere.\nFor those who hold The Godfather\n(and more disappointingly the sequel)\nsacred, get over it. Even Coppolla himself wasn\u2019t a fan and did it for influence\nover taste. Scorsese took it to the next\nlevel and made it even more formulaic by casting DeNiro in every single\none, until he got too old and booted\nfor Leo. Now Scott has been caught\nin the crossfire, but hell, he put himself\nthere.\nDon\u2019t let that put you off though,\neveryone else loves it, including our\nreviewer.\nI\u2019m just looking for a reason to\ncomplain.\nwilderness, voyaging over land and\nwater to find the lost golden city of El\nDorado. The likely guess is that it was\nonly the success and quality of Aguirre\nthat convinced Kinski to return to the\nAmazon for Fitzcarraldo, his operatic\nepic for which conventional shooting\nwould have to be completely assuaged.\nFitzcarraldo is possibly as much of\na self-portrait as Hitchcock created in\nVertigo, a vivid recreation of Herzog\u2019s\ndrive and determination embodied by\nKinski in the titular role. Fitz is a man\nso committed to his love of opera that,\nin order to fund the building of an opera house in his remote Peruvian town,\nhe buys a stretch of river to exploit in\nthe rapidly expanding turn-of-the-cen-tury rubber industry, the only problem\nbeing the rapids between his stretch\nand the preferred final destination. But\nthat\u2019s not a problem when you rope in a\nfew natives and your crew to haul your\nsteamship over a mountain instead.\nThe now notorious task of moving\nthe behemoth ship has gone down in\nmovie history for scale of ambition.\nNot a single special effect was used\nas Kinski watches his ship get pulled\nout of the river and hauled over the\nslight obstacle. It does provide wonder\nfor those who know how\nit was achieved; for\nthose who don\u2019t\nit sadly appears like\na cheap\nparlour\ntrick.\nWith\nthe great\nKinski now\nsadly departed from the\nworld, it would\nappear that Herzog is on the lookout for a new an-tagonisttoconsume.\nRescue Dawn sees\nChristian Bale bravely\ntake on the impressive\nmantle, and it seems that\nHerzog hasn\u2019t lost his\ntouch for the dramat-ic. In true Bear Grylls\nstyle,theHollywood\nstar is forced to\ntake a bite out of\na live snake, a\nmove that\nwould\nsurely have made Ben Affleck throw\nhimself under the next steamship\nHerzog had ploughing through the\nrainforest.\nFor many people however, the name\nWerner Herzog will be synonymous\nwith documentary (e.g. Grizzly Man)\nrather than these jungle tales of fiction.\nThe truth is that Herzog is a supporter of the authentic above all else. His\nmethods have, possibly, overshadowed\nthe quality of his actual work, but how\ngreat is it to have someone whose off-screen persona generates just as many\ngreat stories as their films can tell? The\nsame couldn\u2019t be said of Steven Spielberg or Michael Mann.\nStill, had Hitchcock been around on\nthe scene, it\u2019s hard to believe he would\nrefrain from using his immortal catch-phrase: \u201cIt\u2019s only a movie\u201d. The difference is, for Herzog, it\u2019s much more.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nRescue Dawn \u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Werner Herzog\nWriter: Werner Herzog\nCast: Christian Bale\nSteve Zahn\nRescue Dawn is as much a testimony\nto Herzog\u2019s continued penchant for\nauthenticity as it is a lament to his\nstorytelling abilities of years gone by.\nThe truth is that Herzog never made\n\u2018enjoyable\u2019 films in the strictest sense of\nthe word; his work in the seventies and\neighties was full of character (not least\ndue to the repeated appearance of the\ncolourful Kinski), the works of a man\nwith something to put right without\nthe luxuries or complacencies of a simplistic story. With Rescue Dawn how-ever, Herzog has found a state of limbo\nbetween documentary and a story-propelling narrative, leaving both sides\nsadly short.\nIt perhaps seems folly to judge a Herzog film on its watchability when his\nfilms, even compared against those\nof his New German Cinema contem-poraries, had a habit of dragging their\nheels in sobriety on way to narrative\nthrust. The critical themes of this cinema that pulled it into the international\narena and brought it onto the tip of\na new creative wave are lost in the\njungle of Rescue Dawn.\nThe opening CGI plane crash is,\nperhaps, the first hint that the studios might have tampered with Herzog\u2019s\ninitial vision of this story, sending any\nof his biting social commentary into a\nnosedive. Much more likely, however,\nis Herzog\u2019s recent immersion in docu-mentary. Even Rescue is based on his\ndocumentary of 10 years ago, Little Dieter Needs to Fly, in which he took the\nVietnam escapee back to the Laotian\njungle where he was held captive following a crash on his debut flight.\nRescue is the story of his capture and\nescape, but manages to avoid being\noverly critical of either side in the con-flict. Instead of criticising the powers\nthat be, this could be the story of one\nman\u2019s struggle to overcome adversity,\nand while this is primarily what the film\nfocuses on, the character work done on\nDieter seems slightly sketchy even with\nChristian Bale in the lead role.\nBale is one of the worlds best jobbing actors today and certainly one of\nthe most interesting. Beguiling in the\nwhole spectrum from Patrick Bateman\nor Batman, action man or actor man,\nfew Hollywood stars could have, or\nwould have, coped with the demanding\nHerzog. His dedication may know no\nbounds but he doesn\u2019t seem stretched\nenough here for any length of time.\nUltimately, Herzog seems to have\nforgotten the truth that a story, not just\ndocumentaries, can tell, and so Rescue\ncan be tough going. No surprise there\nthen, but without the redeeming commentary to salvage from the wreckage\nit is just short of going up in flames.\nYou sure you don\u2019t want to eat the snake too? Why?\n\n"

Although\ninitially impenetrable, it\ncould be argued that on one level this\nis a straight-forward protest against\nthe treatment of the political prisoners\nin Guantanamo Bay.\nHowever, on a deeper level it is apparent that the pillowcase is a representation of the way in which we are\nall forced to silence our inner desires\nin order to function in society.\nThe subject depicted in the photo\nis undergoing an internal battle \u2013 he\nis enslaved to the laws of civilisation\nbut is craving the independent, free\nthought brought to him through his\nmusic.

Lord Byron himself lamented\ntheir removal from Greece: \u201cDull is the\neye that will not weep to see / Thy walls\ndefaced, thy mouldering shrines removed / By British hands\u2026\u201d. His views\nobviously fell on deaf ears, as Keats was\nable to visit the Elgin Marbles and so\nbe inspired by an urn he saw there to\nwrite this poem. Indeed, even Francis\nCrick (co-discoverer of DNA) went on\nto use this poem as inspiration for the\ntitle of his book What Mad Pursuit \u2013\nsee first stanza.\nUpon initial reading, the poem is\nshrouded in mystery. One does not\nknow to whom the poem is referring,\nwhat the characters are doing or where\nthey are going, highlighting Keats\u2019 theory of \u2018Negative Capability\u2019 whereby\ngreat minds have the ability to accept\nthat not everything can be resolved\n(something I\u2019m sure that a lot of scientists might have trouble doing).\nKeats observed the scene depicted\non the urn and delved into his own interpretation of what is happening in it.\nThe ode seems to be addressed to the\npeople on the urn; the poet recognising the flurry of events spurred on by\npassion, both envying and pitying their\nsituation.\nHe longs for their perpetual energy\nmade possible by the fact that they are\nimmobile, etched on the urn and suspended forever in this way. Yet he pities the fact that they, nor their feelings,\ncan not change and that they are locked\nin this passion, never to achieve climax\n- \u201cthat can not shed / your leaves, nor\never bid the spring adieu\u201d.\nThe most controversial and complex\naspect of the poem comes in the last\ntwo lines, regarded as one of the most\nnotorious quotations in English Literature. Due to some ambiguous punc-tuation, it is unclear who the speaker\nis and to whom it is being addressed.\nPoet T.S. Elliot thought very little of\nthe last two lines. He referred to them\nas \u201c a serious blemish on a beautiful\npoem\u201d. One interpretation is that it is\nKeats who is addressing and criticising\nthe figures on the urn.\nAnother interpretation is that it is\nthe urn who is the speaker. It begins by\nquoting Sir Joshua Reynolds (greatest\nauthority on art at the time)- \u201cBeauty is\ntruth, truth beauty\u201d and goes on to affirm that truth is indeed all we need to\ncreate superb art. The preceding words\nto the last two lines, \u201cthou say\u2019st\u201d, imply\nthat it is the urn\u2019s and not Keats\u2019 voice.\nMaybe we should accept that not\neverything can be answered and enjoy\nthe poem for what it is \u2013 perhaps the\nlast two lines were added for no other\nreason than to confuse!\nOde on a Grecian Urn\nThou still unravish\u2019d bride of quietness,\nThou foster-child of silence and slow time,\nSylvan historian, who canst thou express\nA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\nWhat leaf-fring\u2019d legend haunt about thy shape\nOf deities or mortals, or of both,\nIn Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\nWhat men or gods are these?

After having caffeine, an individual may temporarily feel more\nawake and energetic. Caffeine also acts\nas a diuretic, which causes the kidneys\nto excrete more urine.\nResearch provided by the American\nCollege of Sports Medicine (ACSM)\nhas shown that ingestion of 3-9 mg\nof caffeine per kilogram (kg) of body\nweight one hour prior to exercise increased endurance running and cycling performance of well-trained,\nrecreational athletes in the laboratory.\nThis compares to approximately 2-6\nregular size cups of coffee.\nMany of the reasons for and against\nwhether caffeine enhances sports performance are conflicting as there is still\nmuch research that needs to be done\non the effects of caffeine on perform-ance. There are also ethical issues in\nrelation to sports, caffeine ingestion\ncurrently is not illegal in sports but\nhigh doses of caffeine are considered\nillegal by the International Olympic\nCommittee. If an athlete deliberately\ntakes pure caffeine to gain advantage\nover competitors, it is considered unethical and doping by many.\nSo how does this affect you? First\nlets look more into the effect caffeine\nhas on the body. After taking caffeine\nyou may notice an: increase in heart\nrate and pulse, increase in breathing,\nincrease in adrenaline, you feel awake\nand alert - especially in the morning,\nyou feel less drowsy and tired, you can\nconcentrate better, you can think more\nclearly.\nCaffeine is found in coffee, tea,\nsoft drinks and chocolate. In smaller\namounts it is an active ingredient in\ncold and flu remedies, decongestants\nand painkillers. Things we know all too\nwell and eat or drink as part of our daily diet, for some people 3-4 times a day.\nGenerally: 200-500mg/day is regarded\nas moderate use; 600-750mg/day is regarded as high use and over 1,000mg/\nday is regarded as a toxic amount.\nCaffeine\u2019s stimulant effect peaks\nabout an hour after consumption and\ndeclines as the liver breaks it down.\nIf you occasionally drink coffee, you\ntend to be more sensitive to caffeine\u2019s\nstimulant effect compared to the daily\ncoffee drinkers who have developed a\ntolerance to it.\nIt is important to be aware that prolonged and frequent caffeine intake\ncan lead to side effects which can\ncause the following: anxiety and nerv-ousness, sleep problems, headache\nand tremor, restlessness and irritabil-ity, produces more stomach acid and\nurine, nausea and stomach complaints\n(heartburn, indigestion, may aggravate\nulcers), tense muscles, palpitations and\nirregular heart beats, increase in blood\npressure.\nAccording to the ACSM, for the average adult who is exercising with the\ngoals of enjoyment and self-improve-ment, using caffeine defeats these\npurposes. Although you may feel as\nthough you are increasing perform-ance, it may be more related to the increase in alertness and energy due to\nelevated heart rates.\nProper training and nutritional habits such as eating a meal high in carbohydrates 2 hours before a workout\nare more sensible and productive ap-proaches. And these have clear benefits without the side effects.\nTennis\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 6\nICU Men\u2019s 1st 4\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd 7\nUniversity of Reading Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nICU Women\u2019s 1st 5\nBrunel Women\u2019s 1st 4\nVolleyball\nUniversity of Essex Women\u2019s 1st L\nICU Women\u2019s 1st L\nFixtures and Results in association with Sports Partnership\nSaturday 1st December\nFootball \u2013 ULU\nKing\u2019s Medicals 1st vs ICU Women\u2019s 1st\nVolleyball\nWeekend Tournament\nICU Men\u2019s 1st vs ULU Men\u2019s 1st\nICU Men\u2019s 1st vs Sussex Men\u2019s 1st\nICU Men\u2019s 1st vs UCL Men\u2019s 1st\nAfter exercise, caffeine is a poor\nchoice for fluid replacement. The best\nbet is to replace with a non-caffeinated\ndrink such as water just after the activ-ity, and then later if you so desire, enjoy\nyour favourite caffeinated beverage - in\nmoderation!\nTo finish, caffeine affects each person\u2019s performance differently. In answer to the question will it enhance\nyour performance? It\u2019s a case of trial\nand error that will indicate the best\npractices regarding caffeine intake\nfor your body for instance if caffeine\nmakes you queasy or light-headed during exercise, don\u2019t use it!\nDrink Caffeine content (mg)\nPer 100ml Per mug/\ncan\nBrewed\ntea\n25-55 55-140\nBrewed\ncoffee\n55-85 140-210\nInstant\ncoffee\n35-45 85-110\nDecaffeinated\ncoffee\n2 5\nCocoa 3 7\nCoca\nCola\n11 36\nPepsi\nCola\n7 22\nWow, a coffee cup shaped with coffee beans... clever\n37\nfelix\nFriday 30 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\n\n"

The game started slow\nand IC were unable to create any real\nchances. Admittedly, it was quite challenging when the entire St. George\u2019s\nteam were in their penalty box defend-ing. St. George began doing all the\nattacking but with Coach Squashie\u2019s\nwords of defensive wisdom echoing in\nour heads, IC\u2019s backline were bloody\namazing dismantling plays. It was as\nif Kate, Vivian, Emma and Cheryl had\nreached an almost telepathic level of\ncommunication.\nThe IC midfield saw a couple of\nchanges this week, but settled down\nwell to produce some quality runs. Pav\nmade a spectacular run down the left\nleaving the St. George defence eating\nher dust. Literally. A St. George de-Football\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nSt. Georges Women\u2019s 1st 0\nCheryl See\nfender had taken to the ground after\nPav sped by, and had to be substituted off. Steph, on the otherside of the\npitch, was as usual picking her beef\nwith one of the players prompting the\nreferee to give them both a warning of\n\u201cNow, now girls, let\u2019s not get rowdy!\u201d\nTough love.\nThe second half started and IC were\nthe more prominent team. With Steph\ncharging down the right and Karen on\nthe left, all the ten St. George players\nwho ran back to defend were stretched\nwide, leaving space for Pav, Rita and\nLily. Unfortunately, it was just not the\nattackers\u2019 day and many shots were denied by a St. George player or sent out\njust wide.\nA more amusing, or worrying, moment of the game was when St. George,\nnot wanting to miss out on contributing to the Retarded Football Antics\nHall of Fame, saw a player attempting\na throw-in by means of a one handed\nbasketball-like lob.\nIC began to get impatient and the\nbackline began to push up to support\nthe attack. Even more chances were\ncreated by Kate with her crosses and\nEmma with hers. With fifteen minutes to go, IC finally scored. Pav had\ndrifted in a beauty of a cross from\nthe right which fell to Lily in the box.\nSt. George\u2019s keeper closed her down\nquickly but due to what can only be\nexcused as a really bad sense of judge-ment, the keeper took out Lily rather\nthan the ball, and the St. George goal\nwas left unattended. The ball had been\nsqueezed out and was rolling away at a\nturtle-like speed. Cheryl, who had already started to make a run in when the\nball left Pav\u2019s feet, experienced a stroke\nof good luck in reaching the loose ball\nbefore anyone else. It was an easy goal\nand would never have been possible\nhad Lily not taken out the goalie... by\naccident.\nPumped from the goal, Emma decided to make a run from the right side of\nthe pitch to the left and began to attack\nquite vivaciously. This of course, inspired the backline to consider careers\nin more attacking roles, leaving goalie\nEmily defender-less in the IC half. Fortunately, the IC defence were brought\nto their senses after Emily let loose a\ntirade, pointing out to Emma that she\nwas, in fact, a right back and not a left\nforward.\nIt is believed now that word will\nspread of our tactic of bringing less\nthan a full squad of players to BUSA\ngames, causing the opposition to get\nover-confident and under-estimating\nus. The subtleties of the mind games\nwe play are beyond our foe.\nSince this is a double match report, I\nwill continue to tell the tale of how on\nSunday, IC Women\u2019s secured their first\nwin of the season in the ULU Premiership, coming back to form with a stunning 5-1 victory over Goldsmiths.\nICdominatedfromthebeginningand\nfive minutes into the game launched\nan attack which saw Chin taking on\ntwo defenders and when they realized\nthat they were out-skilled, one of them\ndropped to the ground clutching her\nleg in agony and play was stopped. And\nplay was stopped for a long time and\nthen surprisingly resumed again before\nthe New Year. It seemed like a pathetic\nattempt to break IC\u2019s momentum, but\nthe first goal of the game came ten minutes after play was resumed. Chin hit\na beauty of volley which was punched\naway by the Goldsmiths\u2019 keeper only\nfor IC\u2019s Lily to send the ball into the\nback of the net on the rebound. Many\ncreative plays were constructed with\nDehydys, Pav and Steph being behind\na lot of clever touches, crosses and\nthrough balls to Chin and Lily upfront.\nAnd two minutes after the Lily\u2019s goal,\nsuperstar Rita got her first goal for IC\nand not wanting to stop there, she proceeded to score her second for IC.\nGoldsmiths was suffering from poor\nsupport down the wings and their for-wardwasgettingmorefrustratedbythe\nsecond, engaging IC\u2019s left back, Cheryl\nin a shoving match, which Cheryl won,\ngiving away a free kick just outside the\nbox in the process. The beef-of-the-match was between Cheryl and Goldsmiths No.2 and surprisingly Steph was\nnot involved. The freekick surmounted\nto nothing and IC keeper Emily did not\nface many (or any) challenges and the\nfirst half came to an end.\nThe second half started with Goldsmiths out for vengeance. They played\nquick passes succeeding in stirring the\nalmost slumbering IC defence. Laura,\nEmma and Jools made crucial clear-ances. Unfortunately the attacking\nonslaught resulted in a lucky goal for\nthe opposition. Whatever hope was\nkindled from that goal was shortlived\nbecause Rita netted herself a hat trick\nsoon after, officially making her dame\nof the game.\nDue to my over-attentiveness, exactly how another Goldsmiths player\nbecame injured will not be explained.\nWe could pretend that she collided\nwith one of the IC players, which is\nthe equivalent to running into a wall.\nThe Goldsmiths player, being sporting,\nbegan to hobble off the pitch but their\ncoach, gesticulating wildly started\nshouting, \u201cfall to the ground!\u201d So she\ndid. And as Emily pointed out, it felt\nlike we were on a time-out in a basketball game. Play resumed and Dehydys\nscored, punishing Goldsmiths for their\ntime wastage. Dehydys, from the edge\nof the box, took a cheeky, but an absolutely perfect shot on goal that went\nover the defenders, confused the keeper and into the back of the net.\nGoldsmiths kept trying and won\nquite a few corners but even though\ntheir forward was rubbing up against\nEmily in an attempt to seduce the\nball in for a goal, it didn\u2019t happen. IC\nmade a substituion, bringing on keeper\nKeren for keeper Emily, who probably\nwas fighting the urge to swim in disinfectant after the encounter(s) with the\nforward.\nFootball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 5\nGoldsmith\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st 1\nRoyal School of Mines Hockey teams continue rich vein of form, see page 38\n\n"

Despite the droves of anti-fascist protestors who turned up to the Union,\ndelaying the debate for over an hour,\neventually it successfully went ahead.\nThe event was scheduled to begin at\n8:30pm, however around 1000 protestors showed up causing a lengthy de-lay. The demonstrators believed that\nthe Oxford Union was irresponsibly\ngiving the two controversial figures a\nplatform to air fascist views that could\nincite racial hatred. Oxford Union has\nalso been accused of holding a publicity\nstunt in order to raise its own profile.\nHowever, many people have come\nout in support of the debate since they\nbelieve it is rather hypocritical to deny\nsomeone the privilege to talk on the\ntopic of free speech, no matter what\ntheir views are. Supporters have also\npointed out that society will never be\nable to understand how extremists\nthink if they are not given the chance\nto voice their opinions.\nMr Irving and Mr Griffin didn\u2019t actually speak in the same discussions since\nthey were separated due to \u201csafety reasons\u201d, although both debates were on\nthe same subject. Mr Irving was joined\nby two MPs, a journalist and the Oxford Union President Luke Tryl whilst\ntwo Oxford University postgrads sat\non the panel with Mr Griffin.\nFelix contacted Jonny Wright, an Oxford University student who attended\nthe forum and reported on the event in\nhis blog. Mr Wright stated he was \u201cimmensely glad \u2026 to be able to hear Irving speak\u201d although he admitted that\nhe \u201cfelt sickened by Irving\u2019s constant\nreferences to the Holocaust.\u201d\nWhilst it seems the debate itself\nmaintained a civil atmosphere, the\nanti-fascists hogged the limelight\nthroughout the night. Disrupting the\ndebate for over an hour wasn\u2019t all \u2013 later on some of them managed to storm\npast the security guards into the debating chamber. Further still, the demonstrators chanted \u201ckill Tryl\u201d at various\npoints throughout the evening, which\nas one of the forum participants put it\n\u201cfell very much outside the limits of legitimate free speech.\u201d\nA thorny issue indeed, maybe something to put to the floor. What does\nthis house think? Left, BNP leader Nick Griffin and right, David \u201cHolocaust denier\u201d Irving\nOxford Union debate goes ahead despite protests\nTom Roberts\n& Andrew Somerville\nAn official complaint has been lodged\nwith Imperial College Union (ICU) by\nstudents outraged at the behaviour of\nsome members of the Imperial College\nFootball Club, following reports of an-ti-homosexual chanting and offensive\nbehaviour.\nAccording to witnesses, at approximately 10:30pm on Saturday members\nof one of the IC football teams chanted\nhomophobic phrases in Da Vinci\u2019s,\namongst which were the phrases: \u201cfaggots take it up the arse!\u201d and, \u201cpoof,\npoof, poof!\u201d\nSome of these were directed at an\nunknown person who was chased from\nthe bar area, back to his table by the\nchanting group. It is believed that the\npursued man was not connected in any\nway to the football team, and witnesses\nsaid that they thought the chanting was\nintended to intimidate this person, not\nsimply as a joke between friends.\nFelix was told that one of the student staff on duty saw this incident,\nthen spoke to the footballers and presumably asked them to stop. Another\nteam member then arrived, at which\npoint they requested more drinks. A\nsenior member of bar staff then allegedly agreed to give them 16 pints (one\nmore round) in return that they left\nthe bar once they had finished. Reportedly, the student bar staff member who\nwitnessed the incident questioned the\nsenior staff member on duty asking\nwhy they had been served.\nHaving finished their drinks, a member of the football team is said to have\nthrown his plastic skiff at the bar. One\nof the students who was in Da Vinci\u2019s\nat the time told Felix that the bar manager \u201chad a little chat\u201d to the offending\nmember, after which they all began to\nleave. In the Beit Quad the footballers\nbecameincreasinglyrowdyand\u201calmost\nbegan fighting with each other.\u201d At this\nWhy can\u2019t we all just get along?\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\npoint Felix\u2019s source asked the security\nguard in Beit Lodge to intervene. Upon\nseeing the guard emerge from his office\nthe football club members dispersed\nand left the Union premises.\nSpeaking about the incident, the eyewitnesses who contacted Felix stated\nthat they were \u201cangry,\u201d adding that they\n\u201cdidn\u2019t care what the individuals think,\nbut having a public chant is completely\nunnecessary,\u201d and questioned: \u201cwhy\nwere they saying those things?\u201d\nFelix\u2019s sources also spoke to the senior staff member working on Saturday\nnight. They told Felix that he had said\nhe \u201cexpected this kind of thing on a\nWednesday, not Saturday,\u201d and that\n\u201c[the bar staff] can\u2019t stop them from\nsinging what they sang.\u201d He is also\nreported to have said that since there\nwere only three staff on duty: \u201cwe can\u2019t\ndo anything about it.\u201d\nFelix contacted the Imperial College\nFootball Club for comment. A senior\nmember of the Football Club, who was\npresent in Da Vinci\u2019s on Saturday but\nwished to remain anonymous, totally\ndenied this account of events, stating\nthat the reports were \u201cunfounded.\u201d\nThe committee member stated that\nhe was \u201castounded people can make\nthese things up.\u201d His version of events\nwas contradictory; he confirmed that\nthe football club was chanting, but said\nthat these were no different than usual:\n\u201conly [directed] against the Rugby club\nand the medics.\u201d He also strongly denies claims that the football team were\nasked to leave. Similarly, he said that\nthey were not served as an incentive to\nleave; instead the drinks were simply\nbought as the footballers\u2019 final round\nbefore they headed off to a house party.\nHe finished by saying that, \u201cIC Football\nClub is open to people from all back-grounds, cultures and sexualities.\u201d\nFelix also contacted the President\nof Imperial Queers (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender society), Richard\nHayden. He was \u201cvery shocked\u201d by the\nreports from Felix\u2019s sources and added\nthat he \u201cdidn\u2019t expect to hear about\nthis [kind of behaviour] at Imperial, I\nexpect people here to be more mature,\u201d\nand that \u201cbeing drunk is not a good\nenough excuse \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t lower\nyour tolerance.\u201d\nWhen asked about whether he knew\nof any similar instances of homophobic\nhostility at Imperial, Mr Hayden said\nthat he \u201ccould only remember one:\u201d\nnamely an incident last year on the Islamic Society\u2019s public internet forums,\nbut other than that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t think\nof any other incidents.\u201d\nThe Union has stated that it is currently investigating Saturday night\u2019s\nincident, and that disciplinary procedure will be followed accordingly; if\naccounts are accurate the Equal Opportunities policy would certainly\nhave been breached. If one of the football teams is identified, or the Football\nClub as a whole is found culpable, they\ncould face a week\u2019s ban from the Union\u2019s bars.\nThe site of the alleged incident: Da Vinci\u2019s bar\n\n"

And\nnot without good reason since\nthe aforementioned games have\nsince become the paradigmatic\nrepresentatives of their respective areas of expertise. Countless\nplatformers often owe much to\nthis Italian plumber.\nSuper Mario Sunshine apparently set (pun intended) into\nthe winter of discontent for fans\neverywhere. It was supposed to\nhave been the heir to Mario 64\u2019s\nthrone but it was nothing more\nthan a false prophet to many.\nDespite this disappointment,\nlittle has dissuaded gamers from\nlooking up to the jovial handyman as their beacon and messiah.\nHe hasn\u2019t been immune to dubious decisions in the past as well,\nincluding a less than stellar subsidiary games and an absolutely\nappalling live action film. When\nsomeone less than ten years old\ncan call a movie \u2018bad\u2019, then clearly\nsomeone needs to be shot.\nBut that\u2019s pretty much the past\nat this stage. Against all the odds\npushed forth by naysayers, the\nWii has become a bastion of success for Nintendo - it\u2019s a lovable\npiece of hardware that can do no\nwrong. With everything going\nfor it, can the Wii go where the\nGamecube failed to reach? Can\nwe get our true Mario and not\njust another offshoot? In a true\n\u2018the Princess is another castle\u2019\nfashion, gamers have been hopping from report to report upon\nbated breath and all to answer\none question: is this the one?\nThe answer is simple: it\u2019s\nMario.\nSuper Mario Sunshine (Gamecube)\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Sunshine finds itself sixty-feet under. Under the\nocean, that is. Somehow Nintendo managed to make the camera controls\neven worse than in 64. Combine this with invisible walls between islands\nand an infuriating group of inhabitants that you\u2019d take great pleasure from\nlaunching into the Sun, and you have a recipe for disaster. Ok, so perhaps it\u2019s\nnot that bad... Nah, who am I kidding?\nSuper Mario World (SNES)\nWhat made is stand out for me was\nwhen my cousin actually asked her\ndad to buy her the game. She was\nin University. In 2003. That\u2019s when\nI realised that Super Mario World\ndoesn\u2019t just evoke special memories in gamers, but it does so for\nanyone who has played it. And why\nnot? The gameplay is sweet, simple\nand addicting and the music is absolutely unforgettable. Take away\nthe fancy graphics and orchestral\nscores and strip them down to their\ncores and you\u2019ll realise that most\ngames are trying to be Mario, if not\ndirectly but in spirit.\n\n"

As a way of\nshowing the sincerity of my apology, I\ngive you\u2026 a whole three pages of raw,\nhardcore and uncensored politics. This\nweek I\u2019m looking at what\u2019s happening\nin the home of Captain \u2018Chaz\u2019 America\nand asking; how are things today in the\nU.S.A.?\nWe got to start somewhere and I arbitrarily choose the war on terror. As\nif you didn\u2019t already know, terrorism\nis a problem for the U.S.A. While 9/11\ntriggered the war on terror, it has not\nbeen fought \u2013 in the traditional sense\n\u2013 on U.S. soil. The \u2018war on terror\u2019 is\nbeing fought in Iraq and Afghanistan;\nalthough I sometimes get the impression some people would rather fight it\nin Iran.\nAt the very least the presence of\nU.S. troops in Iraq is a bit confusing.\nI include it in the war against terror\nsection for convenience but the toppling of Saddam did not help destroy\nanti-western radicalism, it didn\u2019t really\nachieve anything else either; ok it did\ntopple Saddam. But there are plenty\nof tyrannical leaders on this earth who\nhaven\u2019t been pulled out of the ground\nby U.S. marines. The invasion and occupation (for want of a better word)\nof Iraq achieved increased oil prices,\nincreased hatred of the U.S., greater\ninstability in the Middle East and the\ndeath of U.S. soldiers; if you can spot\nthe benefits contact me please. The\nsituation in Iraq isn\u2019t good; sorry let\nme be clear it\u2019s a mess. While improvements have been seen due to the temporary U.S. surge \u2013 by improvement I\nmean less people are getting blown up\n\u2013 Iraq is going to remain a divided, corrupt and weak nation for many years to\ncome, and that\u2019s the absolute best case\nscenario. The current government under Nouri al Maliki is not representative of all the groups within Iraq and\nthis causes further friction between\nKurdish, Sunni and Shia people. Iraq\nis unable to resist the influence of it\u2019s\nneighbouring nations such as Iran and\npeople within government and other\nofficial institutions are more likely to\nconsider their tribal allegiances more\nimportant than the proper execution\nof their job \u2013 in a less elegant way I\u2019m\nsaying that the police and army are\nfull of Iraqi men who use their training for death squad style killings rather\nthan what\u2019s in their job description.\nThe burning question is \u2018what was the\nrighteous cause that justifies this instability?\u2019 but unfortunately the answer\nis that there is none. The war in Iraq\nwas the product of a U.S. government\nthat failed to adequately consider the\nconsequences. One can imagine a conversation between Dick Cheney and\nGeorge Bush today.\nCheney: \u201cHey look at that, our actions had real-world consequences\u201d\nBush: *spits out coffee* \u201cWHAAT!\u201d\nThe war in terror is also being fought\nin Afghanistan, albeit with a smaller\nU.S. presence than in Iraq. It is nice\nand easy to label the Taliban as ter-rorists. They are interested in driving\nforeigners out of the country and imposing their beliefs in Afghanistan, not\ninternational terrorism. The Council on Foreign Relations reports that\nviolence in Afghanistan reached its\nhighest level since the ousting of the\ncountry\u2019s Taliban rulers in October\nthis year. It was marked by a worrisome rise in suicide bombings. Attacks\nhave also increasingly spread beyond\nthe restive south to central and eastern\nprovinces, which have been far more\nstable. However at the same time I am\nstrangely optimistic about the future\nof Afghanistan because with the commitment of NATO and other powers\nI believe that the Taliban can be defeated militarily while simultaneously\nsecurity and services can be provided\nto Afghans.\nBut to really judge the success of the\nU.S.\u2019s engagement in Afghanistan (and\nIraq) we have to look at the aims of the\nwar on terror. Essentially it\u2019s about defeating terrorists and stopping more\nterrorists from springing up in their\nplace. Just as a note, spreading democracy is not the aim of the war on ter-ror; it is one of the methods used in the\nwar on terror. The current conflicts do\nnot achieve either of these aims. The\nreason why the wars in Afghanistan\nand Iraq have no benefit to the war on\nterror is because what the U.S. and its\nallies are doing there is nation-building\n\u2013 not with a lot of success. Of course\nnation-building does help fight terrorists because as living standards increase people are going to be less likely\nto take up arms, but it is very indirect.\nHowever this does not apply in today\u2019s\nsituation because firstly the nation\nbuilding has occurred after a lot of nation destroying and secondly because\nwe have seen well educated and relatively well off persons turn to terrorism\nhere in the UK. By the time U.S. troops\nhave pulled out of Iraq the negative effects of occupation will cancel out any\nbenefits from nation building.\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about\nAfghanistan and Iraq, and how they are\ndoing but that\u2019s not what this article is\nabout. What\u2019s the impact on the U.S.\nbecause of these conflicts and the war\non terror in general? There are three\nmain areas, the impact on the image of\nthe U.S. and Americans, the economic\nGeorge Bush is nearing the end of his maximum term in office as President of the USA\nLi-Teck Lau\nPolitics Editor\nThis week, the students of Imperial\nCollege London have been graced by\na 3,000 word essay by Kadhim Shubber on America, spread gloriosly over\n3 solid pages of politics. It\u2019s enough to\ngive Ann Widdecombe some form of\nbrain disease. I have chosen to make\na brief comment on the article to\nensure both sides of what is a many\nfacetted truth is heard.\nKadhim suggests two main reasons\nfor the US invasion of Iraq. Firstly,\nprotecting America from terrorism.\nIt is generally accepted that this objective has indeed failed, and worse,\nincreased Islamic radicalisation and\nWestern antipathy. It would be highly\nunlikely (however George Bush and\nhis administration are caricatured)\nthat political and military analysts\nwith years of experience and training\ncould have arrived at such a conclusion (that invading a predominately\nMuslim country would increase sympathy towards the US in the region).\nThe second is the objective of securing of oil reserves. It is the only\ncredible reason for American efforts\nin the Middle East. Indeed Kadhim\ngoes on to explain quite elegantly the\nimportance of crude in the world today \u2013 it is vital. The US navy ensures\nsupplies flow freely to itself, Europe,\nIndia, China and Japan; all net oil\nimporters and drivers of the global\neconomy. America is the guardian of\nworld trade.\nIt is likely that US policy was meant\nto have the effects of the first Gulf\nWar in the early 90\u2019s, which drove fuel\nprices low, ended the volatility that\nemerged in the 1970\u2019s and is generally\nattributed to bringing about the high\ngrowth and employment witnessed\nthroughout the last decade. Whether\nthese long term objectives will be\nachieved by the US this time around\nis yet to be seen, and for the moment,\nit has appeared that the instability\ngenerated has adversely affected the\nAmerican economy. But then surely\nwe all have blood on our hands for enjoying the prosperity brought about\nin the 1990\u2019s due to American intervention in the Middle East.\nI am a great advocate of certain aspects of liberalism, most probably induced by the media environment that\nI have gown up in, but that\u2019s a whole\nother kettle of moral fish. Is it right\nthat, as Kadhim points out, so much\nof the world\u2019s energy resources are\nunder the control of despotic govern-ments? The power and technology\nthat has grown through development\nis now transferred to the hands of\npower driven rent seekers (to use an\neconomic term) who can then hold\nother nations to ransom and mistreat\nits own populace.\nAmerica has not achieved what it set\nout to since 2003. Its actions are laced\nwith hypocrisy in the name of attaining a higher goal. Its status of world\nhegemon is being eroded quickly by\nemerging powers in Asia. We should\nnot lose sight of these goals and what\nthe US does for the world. When\nits dominance wanes, our \u2018friendly\nneighbourhood superpower\u2019 may well\nbe missed.\ncost and the effect on the security of\nthe U.S. You don\u2019t need to be a genius\nto figure out that the U.S.\u2019s image has\nsuffered greatly. No longer is it seen as\na bastion of freedom or protector of\nhuman rights; amazing that one man\naccomplished so much. In terms of the\neconomic cost, the price of instability\nis certainly very high. Oil prices have\nrocketed in direct response to instability in the Middle East; this instability\nin part is fuelled by the crisis in Iraq\nand the growing tension with Iran. I\u2019ll\ncome back to the current economic\nhealth of the U.S. later but if we want\nto talk sheer figures, some economists\nhave put the cost of the war on terror between 1 trillion and 2 trillion\ndollars.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to address the last impact of the war on terror which is the\nsecurity of U.S. citizens. The justification for the actions of the Bush Administration both at home and abroad was\nto protect Americans. The war in Iraq\ndid not improve the security of Americans; in fact it put many Americans \u2013\nsoldiers and other professionals \u2013 in a\nworse security situation with no tangible gain for citizens at home. In general,\nthe foreign policy of the U.S. since 9/11\nhas not efficiently improved the security of U.S. citizens. While the ousting\n\u201cIraq is going to\nremain a divided,\ncorrupt and\nweak nation for\nmany years\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s finally\nhere!\nDespite getting somewhat delayed for a week\nlonger than expected,\nthe Super Mario Galaxy issue of Felix\nGames has arrived.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy going but I\u2019m quite glad\nthat it\u2019s over, for now. It\u2019s best not to\nthink about the other games of classic descent out there and particularly\nthose on the cusp of release into a sparkling new existence.\nThis week, we make a preamble into\nthe world of platformers and try to\nsee why they\u2019re revered. It\u2019s just sad\nthat despite all the respect people give\nthem, they don\u2019t do much to ensure the\ncontinued survival of the quintessential\nplatformer. It was only recently that I\ndug out my old copy of Jak & Daxter to\ntide me over until I get to sit down with\nSuper Mario Galaxy for a longer ses-sion. It\u2019s definitely one of my favourite\ngames merely because it embodies the\ntenets that make jumpathon titles so\nprecious. The collectible here is the\nPrecursor Egg - a metallic orb of sorts\nthat can be used as a currency in order\nto get another set of items: power cells.\nThe thing about power cells is that like\nthe stars in Mario, a certain number is\nneeded to proceed further. The initiative to keep collecting after the lower\nlimit is in the form of an extended end-ing. To some this may be a mere Easter\negg, while to others it may very well\nchange the entire game. Brilliant.\nOur most honourable Chief Ed Kim\nJongTomospeakstheheartsandminds\nof the Felix team as he reviews Super\nMario Galaxy. All attempts to thwart\nhis review have failed as the North Felix forces have quelled any possible uprisings from the Riposte Raiders. Jokes\naside, there\u2019s a very good reason why\neveryone has something hearty to say\nabout the all new Mario: it\u2019s earned the\npraise.\nA little inset is due here though. Unfortunately we ran out of space to put\nin Luigi - Mario\u2019s younger brother. Always an underdog, the ganglier Luigi\nis still a lovable old fool. He dons the\ngreen part of the Italian flag and never fails to be there to lend his famous\nbrother a helping hand. While he\u2019s\nshunted to sidekick status, do not let\nthat undermine his skills.

Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to\ncontinue at this magnitude from now\non. Most importantly, it\u2019s about you lot\nbeing actively involved that will help us\noffer you more pages in the future.\nNext week we\u2019ll be taking a look at\nAssassin\u2019s Creed and Call of Duty 4.\nStart writing, soldiers!\nThis\nWeek\nReader Riposte\nHe\u2019s baaaaaack\nHow far have we come? Its-a Maaarrrrrio!\nWill I make it? Ooh, shiny...\nAzfarul Islam rediscovers Jak & Daxter and ponders about the platformer genre\nT\nhe watershed release that\nis Super Mario Galaxy is\nportentous on many lev-els. Not only is it a veritable return to form for Nintendo when it comes to their tenderly\nloved Mario franchise, but this game\nmay yet again herald an resurgence in\nthe delicate yet mercurial craft of old\nknown as the platformer.\nFace it: pureblood adventure and\nplatform games have become quite\nintermingled with the vicissitudes that\ngovern the recent ilk of games. In order to survive a surreptitiously harsh\nmarket, games have had to marry into\nvarious genres to evolve and stay on\ntop of a hypothetical foodchain where\nthe rabid gamer is the ultimate preda-tor. This means platforming has been\nrelegated to a gameplay element rather\nthan a raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Somewhere in this\nact, there\u2019s something precious becoming ever so lost.\nWhat truly makes a platformer title\nso immersive, so addicting is that they\nare pure and simple in execution and\naccessibility; mastery becomes a carefully honed art. There\u2019s no need to upgrade character stats or micromanage\nweapons. The key is to offer a core set\nof skills to the curious gamer, augment\nthem with the occasional euphoria-inducing power-up and then tasking\nhim or her to overcome increasingly\nchallenging odds. This means that the\nplayer is more in segue with his or her\ncharacter and soon, playing the game\nbecomes quite intrinsic. It\u2019s no surprise that the best platformer games\nare lauded for the quality and intuitiv-ity offered by their control systems.\nPlatform games take this infinitesimal playability further by satiating that\nprimal desire to collect treasures of\none\u2019s triumphs. Almost all platform\ngames are distinguished by some form\nof collectible item; whether they are\nintegral to your quest or not doesn\u2019t\nreally matter. It\u2019s just that the existence\nof so many of these buggers spurns an\ningrained desire to go after them. Particularly infuriating are those that are\nplaced just beyond reach for the time\nbeing. You know that that little nest\nwill be gnawing at the back of your\nmind and you will return to claim them\nonce you\u2019ve become a little less green.\n\u2018tis a truly strange yet wondrous thing,\nthe platformer.\nAgainst all odds, it\u2019s reassuring to\nsee some developers have the fortitude\nand quality to maintain a healthier balance such that one can truly christen\ntheir work with the noble moniker of\n\u2018platformer\u2019. Nintendo is one of the\nmasters at this craft and Super Mario\nGalaxy is their current opus. However,\nlet\u2019s not forget that there are other titles constantly vying for the throne\nof the Mushroom Kingdom. And you\nknow what? By their own rights, these\ngames are true quality.\nThe curious thing about the modern\nplatformer is that they inevitably bear\nvestiges of trysts with other genres.\nHowever, once you start playing and\nbreak out into that indulgent smile,\nperhaps you can find it within yourself\nto forgive them.\nJak and Daxter\nJak and Daxter is a luscious platformer\nthrough and through; but fortunately\nit succeeds on many more fronts than\nmere gameplay alone. Firstly, it\u2019s presented with the care and nuances of\nan animated film. The characters are\nexpressive, personable and more im-portantly, you genuinely care for them.\nThe voice acting is of exemplar quality\nand the humour quite palatable. Story\nsubtleties are expressed through beautifully haunting artistry. Speaking of\nvisual effects, the game was quite the\ngraphical feast then and still is. The\nworld is an organic, persistent place\nthat actually changes as day passes to\nnight and night passes to day - all while\nyou\u2019re playing. Character animations\nare exquisite with little flourishes to be\nsavoured everywhere. Combined with\naddicting platforming mechanics you\nhave a game that is worth playing over\nand over again despite it being a fair\nfew years after its release.\nKlonoa 2: Lunatea\u2019s Veil\nKlonoa 2 is a side-scrolling platformer\nlost in time and it\u2019s all the more beautiful for that reason. It embraces simplicity in execution and appeal, moreso\nthan others of the same quality. Offering the very basics of motion, the key\nto success in Klonoa 2 lies in the creative problem solving brought into the\nproceedings courtesy of an arcane cir-clet. The solutions lie within the myriad enemies that react in different ways\nto your single magic attack and using a combination of these properties\nwill you traverse a world about to be\ndoomed. However, story elements matter little; the character designs evoke a\nsinister toybox-like atmosphere that\ncan be charming and chilling in equal\nmeasures. This is a vibrant, thoroughly\naddicting adventure. And no, I don\u2019t\nknow what kind of animal Klonoa is.\nPrince of Persia: Sands of Time\nThe original was a gaming landmark\nand the reincarnation is equally so. It\u2019s\na fantastic accretion of all the things we\nlove in our games: ethereal graphics, a\nhaunting soundtrack, puissant voice\nacting, a beautifully choreographed\nstory and above all else, fiendishly\nclever, gravity-defying platforming\npuzzles. Introducing a parkour-esque\nmechanic of running along walls and\nbasically performing feats of superhuman ability, you had to steer the Prince\nclear of the vicious traps that litter\nthe gargantuan Persian castle. Armed\nwith the power of time itself, you can\nreverse, slow down and even stop it.\nWhile it may give you a feeling of pow-er-mongering, the gameplay situations\ncause it to be more a cohesive mechanic than a weapon of luxury.\nPsychonauts\nWhile it\u2019s a game that is quite difficult\nto recommend as a platformer; there\u2019s\nreally no other title like it really. Offering a rather basic (yet satisfying)\nplaying experience littered with some\ndesign issues, Psychonauts is entirely\nabout the plot, personalities and creative pulse. It\u2019s a game that is one part\nthought-provoking, one part hilarious\nand all parts brilliant. To put it shortly:\nit\u2019s a game where you enter the minds\nof others and these physical manifestations of their psyche become your\nplaying fields.

We are being punished for our healthy habits. This is not\njust. Companies even seem to think\nit is their obligation to not only allow\nthese going ons, but to provide facilities for them. I have, therefore, come\nup with an ingenious plan.\nYou know how everyone secretly (or\nin many cases not so secretly) enjoys\nthe simple pleasures of a wheelie chair?\nThe up and down motion, the spinning\naround and around and oh! The scooting to and fro? Don\u2019t you just love the\nfreedom those four degrees bring you?\n(Incidentally, I really think someone\nshould be working on a wheelie chair\nLet\u2019s talk about God, some more\nL\nast week Richard Criddle of\nthe ICCU wrote an interesting piece about God and\npurpose in life. He suggested that life and the actions\nwe choose to take in it are pointless\nwithout God. Well let me reply to this\ntripe. Have you ever heard of Pythagoras by any chance? Or maybe you wandered through GCSE maths and never\ncame across it preferring to refer to the\nbible\u2019s chapter on geometry!\nOkay, so that started a little aggres-sively. But here is the thing \u2013 you are\nwrong! Plain and simple. I further find\nyour way of putting your point across\ninflammatory and aim not to respond\nin the same tone. Instaed, I will stick\nStefan OlssonRobbie\nwith personal attacks on you and not\nyour religious group (only kidding by\nthe way).\nYour error lies in that you assign no\nvalue to yourself or the impact you\nhave on others. When I read your letter\nI could not help but feel that you are a\nvery sad man to believe that your life is\npointless without \u201cthe big dude in the\nsky\u201d patting you on the back when it is\nall over and telling you that it all mattered to Him.\nMy life has meaning to me and I am\nnot a believer. The actions I take directly impact those around me. When\nI tell my girlfriend I love her (yes I am\ntrying to earn brownie points here)\nthat action has an impact on her life.\nWhen I put in extra hours in lab leading to more work getting done my lab\npartner also benefits from my actions.\nIt is the good I can do for those others\nthat gives considerable meaning to the\nactions.\nIs it vain of me to believe that I can\nhave a positive impact on the world? Is\nit vain to hope that I can become a good\nscientist? A scientist that can in turn\nhelp move the human race forward,\neven in the tiniest way. The answer is\nclearly no, it is not. My contribution\nto the human race may be forgotten in\n100 years but that does not mean the\neffects of my contribution will have\ndissipated. And here you further stray\nfrom reason and suggest that it is only\nwhat people remember about you that\nmatters!\nMight I be so bold as to suggest that\nyou are the vain one! You are the one\nthat lacks direction! And worst of all\nyou consider that your life is pointless!\nYou can quote the bible and discuss the\ntruth of what it says but ultimately only\na sense of self-worth can drive you to\ntruly excel and only by excelling will\nyou be remembered like Pythagoras.\nSo if you fear the oblivion from memory I recommend that you start working very hard to be a brilliant innovator\nand hence remembered by the world.\nGood luck sir and if there is God he\nwill appreciate that you, like Him, tried\nto create!\nwith all six degrees of freedom to allow\nthe office-worker the full expression of\nhis inner child.) Look around you next\ntime you get into the office or the labs\nand you will undoubtedly see someone quashing the desires of their inner\nself in this repressive \u2018adult\u2019 society we\nhave created. (Help, help, I\u2019m being re-pressed. You see him repressing me?).\nThis restriction of the expression of\nour souls is clearly not a healthy con-straint; any psychologist will tell you\nthat it\u2019s not good to keep things bottled up. Therefore, it is my conviction\nthat companies should provide wheelie\nchair enjoyment amenities for all their\nemployees. All it need be is one room\nwith a nice floor and a number of well\nmaintained wheelies. Of course, from\nthe more prestigious companies one\nwould expect some other wheelie chair\nregalia to facilitate the full range of\npossible activities; wheelie chair row-ing, wheelie chair hockey, synchronized wheelie chair dancing, wheelie\nchair jousting, wheelie chair drag-rac-ing etc.\nIt is because of the current suppression of our behaviour that the wheelie\nchair has not been explored as a medium in the art and sports world. I mean,\nif they can do Swan Lake on ice it can\nonly be the tyranny of office etiquette\nthat has restricted the development\nof Swan Lake on wheelie chairs. Restraint and adulthood are curses and I\nsay break free. Kick the autumn leaves\nas you wade through them, don\u2019t walk\naround them whatever you do. Slide\ndown banisters if it makes you happy.\nJump in a puddle. Have a spin on that\nchair and race your neighbour, you\nknow it\u2019s the right thing to do.\nSo what are we to do about all this?\nHow about writing a letter to your MP\nhighlighting the injustice in the system?\nTogether we can force the government\nto draw up legislation requiring that\nall companies provide these wheelie\nchair enjoyment amenities.
