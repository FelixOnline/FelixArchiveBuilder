Side One features\n\"Powerful Songs\" (they say) written\nby Alan Hull, from Lindisfarne\n(\"The fog on the Tyne is all mine, all\nmine...\"), and is backed with trendy\nnew stuff from the likes of Tom\nRobinson, Billy Bragg and Heaven\n17 (?). At \u00a34.99 with all profits to the\nunemployed, how can you say no?\nThe latest whisper from the ICA is\nthat Raymond Briggs, author of\n\"When The Wind Blows\", is\nspeaking there at the end of the\nmonth. With it, we hear, is a special\nshowing of the film of the book,\nstarring such faces as David Bowie\nand others. When The Wind Blows,\nif you didn't know, is about the life of\na family after the Bomb has sent the\nICA and the rest of us into oblivion.\nWhile we're on the subject of Mr.\nBowie, he has been busy recently\nproducing the latest album for Iggy\nPop, called, believe it or not, \"Blah,\nBlah Blah\". Quite. For those of you\nwho keep up with this particular cult,\nsee him on December 17 at the\nBrixton Academy.\nAlbum of the month must be\nEverything But The Girl Play Baby\nThe Stars Shine Bright, but the bad\nnews is that their concert at the\nAlbert Hall is full up.

I wait and see what words\nthe music press will use instead of\n\"folk\" this time.

AU will be recorded\nand free copies will be available for\nfans later.\nPeering into the future, Elvis\nCostello will be at the Royal Albert\nHall (a popular place, it seems) from\n22-28 January.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday October10 th19862 Calling All\nWomen\nScientists\nDear Female Scientist/Engineer,\nLet me introduce myself, my name\nis Jane Cannon, and I am the\nPresident of the University of\nLondon Union; I am also an\nengineering graduate. I would like to\nextend an invitation to you to come\nto the first ULU Women Scientists\nand Engineers meeting at 6.30 on\nTuesday 14 October at ULU.\nThe reasons for having such\nmeetings are two-fold. Firstly they\nwill serve as a social gathering - some\nof you may find that you are the only\nfemale in a class full of males and it\ncan be difficult to get to know people\nunder such circumstances, we hope\nto put you in touch with many other\npeople in the same situation.\nThe second reason for the meeting\nis to put together a group of you who\nwould like to travel around the\ncountry to schools and careers\nconventions to encourage more girls\nto follow in your footsteps and study\nscience and engineering.\nPlease try and come to the meeting\nwhether you are a first year, a post\ngraduate, or anywhere in between,\nand let me know in advance my\ntelephone (01-580 9551). Depending\non the numbers, we may be able to\nprovide some free refreshment!.\nHope to meet you soon,\nJane Cannon,\nPresident, ULU.\nRector\nSets The\nRecord\nStraight\nDear Sir,\nI have only just caught up with\nMr Neil Sykes' complaint ('Life in a Northern Town'), in your issue of 3\nOctober. I do not believe that\nanyone who was present on the\noccasion when I addressed the first\nyear students, could possibly have\nso misunderstood my message. This\nwas a plea for making the most of\nwhat London has to offer, during\nthe years of study. I pointed out that\nLondon is the theatre and music\ncapital of the world, that we are\nsurrounded by some of the most\ncelebrated museums in Europe; that\nit would be a dreadful shame to\nforego all that and then find\noneself\u2014and here the offending\nwords\u2014in some place remote from\nsuch, quite unique opportunities.\nNow I do not read speeches.\nThere will, as a result, be an\noccasional loss of syntax, some\ninfelicitous phrases which could\nreadily be banished from a printed\npage. I believe this to be price worth\npaying, to avoid the deadening\neffect of a message read.\nLet me assure Mr Sykes that I am\nwell aware of the fact that neither\nindustry nor culture stop North of\nWatford; that I have labour ed in\nindustry\u2014in factories as well as\nlaboratories. It is my earnest hope\nthat the experience of studying at\nImperial College will benefit the\nwhole country\u2014that, in particular,\nmany of our graduates will do their\nbit to re vital is e the regions that are\nin greatest need. It would be a crying\nshame if all Yorkshiremen were to\nget stuck in London.\nYours faithfully,\nEric A Ash\nRector\nHissing at the NUS\nA few people have told me that\nthey thought Tuesday's UGM went\nquite well. In that it wasn't bogged\ndown by numbing ly tedious\nprocedural discussion, and that one\nmoderately useful motion was\npassed, I concede they are right.\nThis was, however, the first UGM\nof the year and the turnout cannot\nhave been more than ISO; frankly a pathetic response. The change of\ndate, and the bloody-mindedness of\nIndsoc, may be partly responsible\nfor this, but few people will be\nencouraged to attend again after\nTuesday's showing.\nIt is naive of me, I am sure, to\nexpect the highest body in the Union\nto take an interest in serious debate\nof any issue. It is a symptom of the\nfamous 'apolitical' stance of ICU at\npresent. Party political wrangles are\nperhaps undesirable, but without the\npolitically orientated groups at\nCollege I doubt if any serious\ndiscussion would ever occur. For the\nmost part we are treated, to moronic\nMonopoly Rag\nCCU offices Saturday\nOctober 18th at 9.30am. Concert at\nHammersmith Town\nHall with Tri-60 and\nBlue Blue Ice, disco and\nbar afterwards free to\nMonopoly participants.\nTickets 5Op each from\nUnion Office to others in\nadvance only.\narguments over soft toilet paper, and\nburdened with a group of mindless\nindividuals in the back row\npractically hissing whenever the\nNUS is mentioned. The overall\nphilosophy seems to be one of\nsomething less than nihilism.\nAny student Union has a voice\nwhich it ought to make sure is heard.\nI applaud the efforts of ICU Exec to\nattract students to meetings, but the\nproblem is more than timetable\nclash. I cannot offer any instant\nremedy; it is a question of winning\nback the interest of the student body\nby treating UGM's with a degree of\nreverence.\nAn Apology\n2.00pm Thursday, and it looks as\nif this issue may never come out. If it\nappears at all, I imagine the\ncirculation will be severely limited,\nas was last week's.I regret we have\nbeen hindered by a series of\nfrustrating technical problems and I do not think that the Print Unit will\nbe running smoothly for another two\nweeks. I will go to extreme lengths to\ntry to ensure that a full issue of\nFELIX appears on time but there is\ncurrently little more I can do.

Including over a hundred works in a wide variety of\nstyles and media, the exhibition has\nbeen arranged to celebrate the\nNational Industry Year and to\ncomplement the 'Science for\nIndustry' Exhibition (13-17 October\n1986) which is one of the events\nmarking the 50th Anniversary ofthe\nUniversity of London.\nDr Gordon Hargreaves,\nresponsible for the idea and layout\nof the exhibit on, intends it to show\nthat art can come from the\nunexpected sources.\nAmong the attractions will be\nsome of the latest developments in\ncomputer graphics and holography,\nchocolate sculptures, a set of tables\nmade from lorry cab parts, and\nmore conventional s cultures and\npaintings. Some of the artists\nrepresented are Stehanie Fryer,\nPrincella Claugh, Leh Tabuer and\nBrian Chalkey.\nThe exhibition is situated in the\nConsort Gallery on the ground floor\nof the Sherfield Building.\nbim l nut ive Rag Chairman Man Tai Tseung became the latest\nvictim of the Guilds Hit Squad yesterday when he was attacked\noutside the Union Office\nDutch Courage\nThe Holland Club, a club for college\ntechnical staff and postgraduates, is\nto celebrate it's move to the\nbasement of Sherfield with a unique\nbeer. 'Imperial Ale' is being brewed\nespecially for the occasion by the\nCharles Wells Brewery. It will be\navailable free on the first night, and\nwill be later available for sale.\nA spokesperson for the Holland\nClub, who asked not to be identified,\nsaid 'I 'll have another, old boy, jolly\ngood stuff this h'.

The\nroom, which is on level 2 of the\nHuxley building, is not available for\nundergraduates use, however.\nThe head of the Computing\nDepartment, Professor Sayers, said\non Wednesday that the new room\nwas to be used by postgraduates to\n\"talk and think\", although it was\nprimarily a place to study rather than\nto social is e. Another member of the\nDepartment was anxious to point\nout that it was not a common room\nbut rather a \"spiritual centre\" for\nMSc students.\nThe conversion of the\nundergraduate common room for\nseminar use last year, following the\nDepartments' introduction of a new\nMSc course, was greeted\nun favourably by students. Professor\nSayers told FELIX however, that a new undergraduate common room\nwould be given a high priority\ndespite the departments' shortage of\nspace.\nFringe Inventing\nLast Monday's Wellsoc lecture,\n'Fringe Inventions', was given by\nNew Scientist contributor and ex-IC\nstudent David Jones.\nMr Jones, aka 'Daedalus', told\nthe audience of his creations in such\ndiverse fields as sexual attraction\nand the interior hardness of a boiled\negg. He also revealed his frustration\nat some ofthe plans which were later\nadopted seriously, including a crude\nchemical laser, now the backbone of\nSDI's anti-missile technology.\nMr Jones gained this post\nthrough the college publications,\nThe PHOENIX, and has since\nworked on 'The Great Egg Race'\nand numerous scientific programmes for ITV and German\nTelevision. He felt that the aim of\nhis work was to make scientists and\nengineers think, which he said was a very difficult task to achieve.\nExhibit Two\nPrincess Anne will visit Imperial\nCollege to open the Science for\nIndustry Exhibition on Monday. The\nExhibition will run from the 13th to\nthe 18th of this month and will be\nattended by 8,000 schoolchildren.\nGill Davies, the Conference Officer\nwho organised the event, is still\nreceiving applications but due to lack\nof time and space these will have to\nne '\u2022ejected The Exhibition is being\nstag;rt in 'he J. C.R., which will mean\nthat t tie buttery will be closed next\nweek. The Q.T. fast food outlet will\nhowever, remain open and buttery\nseating will be available for\ncustomers use.\nNew Glider\nThe Union Finance Committee\ndecided to purchase a new glider for\nthe gliding club, at a meeting on\nThursday lunchtime. The glider will\ncost \u00a313,000 and will be paid for\nwith the help of an interest free loan\nfrom the College.\nUniversities\nOverdrawn\nBritish universities are \u00a360m in the\nRed, according to a report in\nTuesday's Independent. The\nuniversities have warned the\nSecretary of State for Education and\nScience, Mr Kenneth Baker, that\nthey need an extra \u00a3250m by 1990 in\norder to maintain standards and\nprevent bankruptcy. Mr Baker has\nproposed an extra \u00a3114m for next\nyear, a move now being considered\nby the Treasury. A pay claim of\n\u00a3160m for university staff is also\nunder consideration in an attempt to\nhalt the educational \"brain-drain\".\nFree Speech\nThe NUS is opposing a proposed\nnew law which will allow complete\nfreedom of speech on University\ncampuses. Severalright-wing M.P.s have been prevented by angry\nprotesters from speaking on\ncontroversial issues recently, but the\nNUS feels that the new law may\nexpose certain groups of students to\nharassment and violence. They are\nanxious to prevent the of recurrence\nthe intimidation of black, Asian,\nJewish and gay students in\nparticular.\nOpen All Hours\nThe Union Snack Bar will now be\nopening regularly in the evenings, in\naddition to the normal lunchtime\nservice. The move was heralded by a well attended evening of live rock\nmusic on Monday.\nSnack Bar Manager, Norman\nJardine, told FELIX that regular\nevening entertainment is planned for\nthe future. Anyone interested in\nproviding entertain t ment should\ncontact Norman.\n\n"

By its nature, it is intriguing to both\nartists and scientists. Here Sunny Bains looks at how artists\nand scientists work separately and together to further\nholography in their different ways, each contributing something\ndifferent to what is still only a minority interest. Whether they\nwork in transmission (light is shone through to view) or\nreflection (light reflected off surface to view), use pulse lasers\n(for short intense exposures of unstable objects) or the lowliest\nHelium-Neon (common red light laser) these people have one\nthing in common: they've all been hooked by the hologram.\nHolography Now exhibition in\n1984.\nHis new collection is entitled For\nour friends, everything: for our\nenemies, nothing: and the\nindifferent, the law.

The effect of the\ncombination is quite eerie and\nexpresses both the desolation of a Chernobyl aftermath with the\nConsidering that holography is\nthe most comprehensive way of\nrecording visual information,\nyou may be surprised to learn\nthat the art world still considers\nit to be a fringe pursuit.\nHolograms sell for their novelty\nvalue, not their artistic merit. It\nis not difficult to see why this is\nthe case. If one ventures to look\naround the main holographic\ngalleries (in London, Light\nFantastic at the Trocadero) one\nwill find lots of bright, clear,\nboring holograms with\nabsolutely nothing to to say.\nLess exciting than seaside\nshops on a rainy day, these\nholograms lack that vital\nelement which would make\nthem art: that is, a soul.\nAll is not lost however. There are,\nthankfully, a few holograph ers who\nare genuinely looking to develop\nholography's immense artistic\npotential. Michael Sowdon is such a one.\nSowdon has been involved with\nholography for more than ten years\nnow. An artist by training, he is at\npresent director of Fringe Research\nHolographies, Toronto, which he\nco-founded in 1974. His work,\nwhich has been exhibited in several\ncoutries, is both witty and\ncontroversial, so much so in fact\nthat an anti-establishment work of\nhis, a reflection hol gram entitled Eat\nthe Rich, was banned when shown\nin Britain as part of the Canadian\n'No Jesus' - Michael Sowdon\nbitterness he obviously feels\ntowards those who one day might\nbe responsible for some disaster.\nThat he can use the medium of\nholography to convey such things is\nindicative of the fact that\nholography need n't remain the sort\nof clinical, pure recording method\n. pes r1*s1 y pi If\nk/r ri is W \u20224|\nMaking a hologram\n919dW! n\\t\"\\ FVD''\\VjQC1i\\i33 Bt .'b HOC\nwhich it seems to be at present but\ncan, in the hands of a good artist, be\njust as beautiful and disturbing as\nmany of the traditional art forms.\nHolography can simply give to the\nartist more degrees of freedom than\nhe might formerly have been used\niMt ft \u2022 \u00abBrt 3WO08 bot fo is: tiro\nSowdon has very definite views\non the artistic use of holography,\nand on the practical problems\nrelated to it. By definition, making a' hologram is an expensive and very\ntechnical process. For most artists\nthese two factors make the use of\nthis medium impossible. By running\nan 'artists in residence' scheme;\nFringe Research Holographies\nhave been able to both train\npotential holograph ers and to equip\nthem, if only for a relatively short\ntime. Thus artists are able to learn\nthe trade before deciding whether\nto take the holographic plunge.\nAnother problem which is slowly\nbeing solved is that of the\nrestrictions of the technology itself.\nAt the moment, the lab conditions\nrequired to make hologram are so\nrigorous that the work cannot be as\nspontaneous as one would like.\nWith new technological develop-ment s, especially the more frequent\nuse of pulse lasers in display\nholography, the medium may\neventually become as easy to use as\na camera indoors. The development of the pulse colour technique\nwould enhance this further. The\ntechnology exists and ways of using\nrit artistically are being developed,\nthe prohibiting factor is the cost.\nFor the immediate future,\nMichael Sowdon is interested in\nusing pulse techniques to create\nerotic images along the lines of\nsome of Helmut Newton's photographic work: the bizarre and\nthe sexy. He worked with a pulse\nlaser in Vermont and appreciates\nthe ability of pulse work to observe *\ninstantaneous happenings in a more\nfundamental way than ever before.\nImagine, for example, a hologram\nhe worked on which was taken at an\ninstant when a girl was falling from a balcony. All the effects of gravity\nand wind resistance can be seen in\nthree dimensions. No doubt a little\nimagination could use pulses to\neven more surprising effect.\nThat holography will become a widely recognised art form is no\ndoubt. In Canada, Michael Sowdon\nis already receiving various Arts\nCouncil and other grants. One day\nholography will take its place beside\nphotography, painting and\nsculpture. The only ques it ion is\nwhen.\n%J. sm milo us oil if o q Looking good enough to spend...\nSherfield Exhibition\nHolograph ers, Michael Wenyon and Susan Gamble are\nshowing their work at the Art,\nScience and Industry exhibit-ion, on level 2 in the Sherfield\nBuilding. They have come from\nopposite ends of the holographic world together on\nsome quite beautiful and\nartistic holograms.\nWenyon studied physics at\nBristol and then took the Applied\nOptics MSc course at IC in 1978,\nthus being a classmate of Kaveh\nBazargan. Instead of continuing in\nacademic life, however, Wenyon\nwent on to co-found Goldsmiths'\nHolography Workshop, through\nwhich artists could be trained in\nholographic techniques. Gamble,\nwho studied fine arts at\nGoldsmiths' College, joined the\ngroup in 1980 and subsequently\nteamed up with Wenyon.\nTheir work, which they do jointly\nrather than individually, is\nextremely vibrant and unusual.\nThey have managed to take an\nunfortunate and unavoidable\nholographic side effect \u2014\nspeckle\u2014 and turn it into an asset.\nMany of their holograms seem\nalmost lost under a fog of brightly\ncoloured blobs of varying sizes\nwhich have a quite mysterious\neffect.\nBecause they work as artists,\nrather than manufacturers of\npr tir to tote \u2022m tom ns pst nev b fiat bo in j to so rio i fl.y.' is odi souvenir-type holograms, they find'\nthey can't attract the kind of\nfinancial backing they feel they\nshould. Those who are willing to\nput money into holography tend to\nfavour the commercial rather than\nthe aesthetic. Although they do\nfind this disheartening, they are in .\nno doubt that things will eventually\ngo their way.\nIn February a small holographic\nart display will be opening at the 1\n1\nVictoria and Albert Museum, just\nacross from the Science Museum\nwhich, has its own permanent,\ntechnical exhibition.

Dr Kaveh\nBazargan, Dr Michael Damzen,\nand William McGuigan collaborated to bring about the\nfirst natural colour hologram of\na living object using a single\nlaser.\nKaveh Bazargan has probably\ndone more work on colour\nholography than anybody else in the\nholographic community. Not only\nhas he produced reflection and\ntransmission colour images by\nsuperimposing monochromatic\nholograms, but he has also\ndeveloped his own dispersion\ncompensation technique. The\nBazargan Technique produces\nholograms with full parallax and\nvery low distortion, its only real\ndisadvantage being that the\nhol go rams must be seen through a special viewer which Bazargan\nhimself designed. The new system,\nhowever, has no such drawbacks.\nUnlike any of the old techniques it\ncan produce colour images of\nmoving objects and can be viewed\nusing a white light source.\nThe new technique makes use of\nStimulated Raman Scattering.\nBasically what happens is that a pulse of green laser light is allowed\ns lB ub iv ibi 'Lego Men' - Kaveh Bazargan,\nBgzargan Technique\nto pass into a press uri sed gas cell.\nThe light which emerges from the\ncell consists of three pulses; the\noriginal green, and blue and red\npulses which come from the green\npulse having had its frequency\nshifted up and down respectively.\nWhen a suitable holographic plate\nor film is exposed simultaneously\nusing all three colours, three\nholograms are reproduced each\nexactly matching the other. When\nviewed, these holographic images '\n'Coal Seam' - Wenyon and Gamble\ncombine to give a natural colour 3-D image.\nThe connection between Raman\nscattering and holography was\ndiscovered by accident after a chance discussion between Kaveh\nBazargan and Mike Damzen, it was\nthen suggested to Bill McGuigan, a postgraduate in Applied Optics, as\njoO layoff \u00abr ll Hi\nan ideal MSc project. The results of\nhis research are to be published\ns oort. At the same time as the research\ninto colour work was going on at IC,\nIlford were producing holographic\nfilm which was sensitive to red,\ngreen and'blue\" light. Previously all\ncolour work had to be done on two\nseparate pieces of film; one sensitive\nto green and blue light, and the\nother sensitive to red. Illford were\ncontacted and collaborated with\nBazargan to create a natural\ncolours hologram of a living hand\nholding a credit card.\nUnfortunately there is at present,\nno one responsible for continuing\nDr Kaveh Bazargan\nresearch on this project. Bill\nMcGuigan was only able to work on\nit for the three months allotted to\nMSc project work. Damzen has a demanding job as a lecturer, and\nBazargan is employed at IC to look\ninto 'holographic elements in optical\ncomputing' in Professer Dainty's group, rather than to experiment\nwith display holography. With only\nspare time and odds and ends of\nequipment being available, work\nhas virtually ground to a halt.\nIt is hoped that with a reasonably\nlarge injection of funds (about\n\u00a350,000) either in the form of a SERC or industrial grant, someone\ncan be taken on to continue where\nBazargan, Damzen and McGuigan\nleft off, but with new and more\nsuitable equipment. After that,\nprogress in developing what\nBazargan calls the Holographic\n'dream system' should just be a matter of time.\n\n"

For a whole\nmonth it is possible to immerse\noneself in every form of theatre,\ncinema, dance, mime, opera, music\nand art and to forget totally about\nthe hassles of College. It is easy to\ntake on a whole new identity;\nscience students are suddenly\nelevated to actors, directors and\nlight operators and nobody outside\nthe company is to know that they\nare any different. It provides a unique opportunity for Amateurs\nand Professionals to compete on\nequal terms, and frequently it is the\namateurs that come out on top.\nImperial College Dramatic\nSociety members have been basking\nin this summer madness for a number of years now. Each August\nICDS transforms St John's Church\nin Princes Street (Edinburghs' main\nStreet) into Theatre West End. Here\nthey perform for a few hours a day\nunder the name Beit Theatre, the\nrest of the time they sub-let the\ntheatre to other groups from all over\nthe country and also provide these\ncompanies with technical back-up.\nTheatre West End is now the largest\nstudent-run venue in Edinburgh and\nFestival visitors return to it year\nafter year, this year it was\nrecommended in 'The Observer' as\none of the venues with the best\nquality and variety of shows.\nAugust 1986 was the most\nsuccessful time so far for TWE and\nBeit Theatre. Beit's three shows\nwere; The Woman in White (adapted\nfrom the Wilkie Collins novel by\nNikki Scott). Tony Marchants' The\nLucky Ones (Directed by Gordon\nAdgey) and The Rime of the Ancient\nMariner (adapted and directed by\nWanda Jeziorska). The Woman in\nWhite was the greatest commercial\nsuccess, whereas The Lucky Ones\nmet with best critical and audience\nresponses. They alternated in the\nevening slot during weeks 1 and 2 of\nthe festival. The Mariner played at\nlunchtimes during week 3 and had\ngood reviews and audiences. The\naverage audience for all 3 shows was\naround 80 (TWE has a seating\nafter a lively evening at the Fringe\nclub. This is the watering hole for\nthe performers, the place with the\nhighest density of egos on earth and\na pre ten sio us ness level hitting sky-high, but who cares? Everyone is\nthere to enjoy themselves and,\nthough few will admit it, to get\n'noticed'.\nThe Festival is a great\nopportunity to get familiar with the\nworks of new writers and directors.\nThe hit writer this year was\nundoubtedly the American Sam\nShepard. There were five of his plays\non, and all had an unequalled power\nand intensity. It is only a matter of\ntime before London catches on.\nEdinburgh is a surreal experience,\nand very hard work! Looking back\nit is hard to imagine that I was there,\nperhaps this is due to the fact that I lived on adrenal in, nervous energy\nand 'pro-plus' tablets for a month!\nIt is also unmissable, even if you do\nnot see yourself as a great theatre\nbuff! Details of Edinburgh 1987 can\nbe obtained from current Dramsoc\npeople, but if you can't wait to get\ninvolved, you can come up to the\nConcert Hall on Sat 11th and Sun\n12th October to help set up for\nperformances of The Lucky Ones. If\nyou do not want to help, do come\nalong to watch the production on\nWednesday 15th, Friday 17th or\nSaturday 18th October at 7.45pm.

Any play written by the\nlikes of Dario Fo, Arthur Miller or\nSamuel Beckett will sell out however\ndire the production. It is interesting\nto observe the trends in audiences\nthat occur by the end of week 1.\nSome shows attract the Fringeguide waving tourist whereas others\nwill have audiences consisting of\nother performers. Word gets around\nquickly about what to see, one of\nthis years 'in' groups was the\nexcellent Shadow Syndicate. One of\ntheir shows, Blood of Angels\nremained an obscure production for\nthe weary performers to seek out at\nmidnight, whereas Between the\nDevil and the Deep Blue Sea hit the\ncommercial big time.\nThere are shows on for about 16\nhours a day in Edinburgh and this\nrequires a readjustment in the\nFringe-goers internal clock; up at\nmidday and to bed at 4am( if at all)'\nreview THE LUCKY ONES\nBeit Theatre, the touring company\nof Imperial College Dramatic\nSociety, have been performing at the\nEdinburgh Fringe for several years.\nNot since What do you say before you\nsay goodbye? (1983) has the society\npresented a show as successful with\nthe critics as this summer's The\nLucky Ones by Tony Marchant.\nThis production fully deserved its\nfavourable reaction from the festival\npress. Each member of the cast\nhandled his or her character\nadmirably, and it was the\ncharacter is ation which made this\nplay particularly watch able. I was\nless convinced that the author had\nanything original to say about the\neffects of high unemployment on\nattitudes on the workplace. The\nLucky Ones was billed as as a modern piece, but I felt that its\nstrength was in an intriguing study\nof reactions to authority, which did\nnot seem to particularly dependent\nupon the political climate. Where\nthe production excelled was in the\ntreatment of the relationship\nbetween the company manager,\nLawrence, and the four clerical\nminions. Richard Lester as\nLawrence was a formidable\npresence on stage and gave a very\nconsistent performance. As Dave,\nthe anti-hero of the play, Simon\nLewis made good use of the most\nchallenging role and Liz Holford\nmade the resolute Debbie the most\nbelievable character on stage. Andy\nMeeson as Joe and Mike Foulds as\nTimothy both convinced in the\nmore stylised parts.\nThe Lucky Ones will be\nperformed for three night next week\nin the Union Concert Hall. I throughly re com end that you go\nand see it. The action and dialogue is\nfrequently funny, and Gordon\nAdgey's well paced direction makes\nthe production lively and absorbing.\nDavid Jones\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded1949 DOCSqueeze\nResearch students in the Computing Department are\nbeing forced to work in cramped conditions because of the\nshortage of space in the Huxley Building. A lack of\nfinance from the University Grants Commission has\nmeant that there is also a shortage of cupboards, tables,\nchairs and computer terminals.\nIn the past two years the r mm ber of Research Students taken up by\nthe department annually has risen\nfrom 5 to 23. This has meant that\noffices originally intended for five\nstudents are now being occupied by\nnine, and some of the students are\nhaving to share offices with\nmembers of staff. A25% increase in\nthe number of undergraduate\nadmissions over the next four years\nis likely to cause further congestion\nin lecture theatres.\nThe department hopes that these\nproblems will be eased by the\ncompletion of a new computing\nbuilding which will re-house a number of offices from Huxley by\n1988. As reported in FELIX earlier\nthis year the building,which has\nbeen financed jointly by the UGC\nand the College, will be positioned\nnext to the Sherfield. It is\nanticipated that further space will be\nmade available by the relocation of\nthe Holland Club. The use of this\nspace for lecture theatres is still\nunder discussion.\nA spokesman in computing said\nthat \"about forty to sixty\" new\nterminals would be bought at the\nend of this year, at a cost of two-thirds of a million pounds, in order\nto reduce the current shortage. The\nlack of furniture is also being\ntackled by a number of\nComputings' technical staff who are\nbusy constructing desks and chairs\ninbetween their other duties.\nLast Saturday 250 Imperial College\nstudents tid d ly winked down Oxford\nStreet and Regent Street for Rag. The\nevent raised about \u00a33,500 in one and\na half hours, which is over \u00a3600 more\nthan last year. The traditional 'Ring-o Roses' around Eros was performed\nfor the first time since the statue was\nreplaced. The event was described as\na great success and a magnum of\nchampagne will be presented to the\nperson who has collected the most\nmoney. Participants are reminded to\nreturn their cans to their CCU office\nas soon as possible.\n1\n,\\>*--*^\nWoodcut of planned Computing Building\nPay As You Enter\nThe Natural History and Geological\nMuseums will introduce compulsory\nadmission charges from the first of\nApril. The move follows the Victoria\nand Albert Museums' decision to\nimplement voluntary charges last\nNovember.\nTwo schemes are currently under\nexamination. The first involves\ncharging adults \u00a31.50 and children\n75p for entrance, even though this\ncontradicts the museums policy of\nadmitting children and students free\not charge. A second scheme allows\nfor free admission for children, but a charge of \u00a32.00 for adults. A proposal to introduce a passport-style ticket containing advertisments\nand games, in a self-confessed\nattempt to camouflage the charges, is\nalso under consideration.\nMr. Roy Saunders, Secretary of\nthe Natural History Museum,\nexplained that the charges were\nnecessary to make up for the effects\nof inflation, and for the development\nof new exhibits because the\nGovernment Grant has not kept\npace. \"The exhibits in the Geology\nMuseum are fifty years out of date \",\nhe explained.\nA confidential report prepared for\nthe Museum Trustees estimates that\nthe number of visitors will drop by\n40% as a result of the moves, i he report concludes that, unless\nmeasures are taken, the deficit in\nmuseums' funds \"will increase to \u2022\n,\u00a32.689m by1990\". Raising money by \u2022\nsponsorship, staff reductions and\nbetter marketing of museum\npublications and facilities are also\nsuggested in the report.\nRepresentatives from the Civil\nServants' Trades Union and\nImperial's ASTMS union will be\norganising a demonstration outside\nthe museum between 8.30 and 10\na.m. on Thursday 16th, when the\nmatter is to be discussed by the\nMuseum Trustees.\nFriday October \"0 1986 Issue 749\n\n"

The circus moved firstly\nonto Christine's report: she kept on\ndeclaring with delicacy and\naplomb: \"This microphone's really\nbugger ed.\" Gareth Fish, expert on the\nmyriad variations in the art of\ncalling 'quorum' and exponent of\nconstitutional niceties that most\npeople would prefer to forget\nabout, decided that an interjection\nwould be quite timely. With the\nscope of human experience and\nunion structure to draw upon, he\ncame up with: \"Do you think it is\nright to re-introduce hard toilet\ninstead of soft paper, in clear\nbreach of Council policy?\"\nChristine, however, had done\nher homework beforehand and\nsimply retorted: \"Since that\ndecision was made three years ago,\nand has not been brought before\nCouncil since it has now lapsed\nunder the three year rule.\"\nThe three year rule is simply a piece of legislature that makes sure\nunion policy is reviewed every once\nin a while, to avoid situations\nfound in English law where it is still\npossible to be arrested for spitting\nout of a second storey window after\n6 o 'clock under an edict made in\n1643.\nIt was then pointed out that the\nthree year rule had also probably\nlapsed since that hadn't come up\neither last year. Christine replied\nthat that she was pretty sure it \"was\na bye-law anyway\" which did\nmanage to avoid plunging the\nmeeting into relativistic policy\nwrangling over whether a rule\nwhich had lapsed could overrule\nanother one which had also lapsed\nat the same time. Before any\nquestions about the design of the\nsoap dispensers could be raised\nChristine's report was accepted\nand the meeting moved on.\nJackie's report was largely\nuneventful, apart from a very\ntouching handover from Hugh.\nDave Colley started to rant about\nclubs who had used day g lo posters\nwithout his permission which then\nstarted an argument between him\nand Hugh Stiles about who's publicity rules were more up-to-date.\nHe then proceeded to threaten to\n\"have John Ranson's legs\" for\npretending that Anti-NUS Soc was\na recognised IC society whilst using'\nthe photocopier in the Union\nOffice.\nStaying with the Hon Sec for the\nelections, Adrian Johnson seemed\nto be so keen about attending\n\"boring GUC meetings\" that he\nbecame GUC Delegate, whilst an\nunsuspecting Mark Cottle was\nproposed for Ordinary Member of\nHouse Committee since he\nhappened to be standing around\nholding a microphone at the time.\nWith that over, the guest\nspeaker, ULU President Jane\nCannon explained that there really\nwas student life on the other side of\nHyde Park.\nFinally the motions again caused\nthe most procedural hassle. An\nemergency motion was taken first\non whether to fine clubs who\norganised events which clashed\nwith UGMs\u2014three guesses why\nthis one came up. Although it was\npassed in essence, it didn't get\nthrough unscathed. The first\namendment, from Andy Vickers,\nwas to withdraw the section on\nfining clubs who transgressed the\nruling, this was then the subject of\nthe second amendment as Gren\nManuel tried to put it back in\nagain. People weren't too keen on\nvoting back in something that had\njust been rei i.o ved, and the motion\nremained without the fines clause. As it became the victim of yet\nanother procedural motion to\nmove straight to a vote, Gareth\nagain piped up to say that there\nought to be a summing up speech\nfirst. Hugh's reply was short, polite\nand to the point:\n\"Bollocks.\"\nWhich was followed rapidly by\nan apology as he remembered that\nthere was supposed to be a summing up speech. With that out\nof the way, the final motion was left\nto be contested. That hoary old\nchestnut, the Barclays Motion once\nagain resurfaced, and once again\nJohn Ranson called quorum.\nLater, in the Union Office Hugh\nwas heard to utter his favourite\nanatomical word as he discovered\nthat his interpretation was right\nafter all: which only goes to show\nthat procedural motions can\nseriously damage your credibility.\nCHRIS EDWARDS\nUlU travel\nTwice the size \u2014\nTwice the service\nCall into the new ULU Travel\noffice and see how far\nyou can go this winter\nSpecial fares for students\nand academics.\nWorldwide scheduled\nflights on quality airlines.\n\u2022 Ski holidays.\n\u2022 Winter breaks around\nEurope.\n\u2022 ISIC cards, ISIS\ninsurance, Group rates.\nWinter Warmers include \u2014 daily\nflights to New York \u00a3 2 2 2 rt n.

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday October 10th19869 FILMS by Jim Clayden\nIn any film involving a variety of\nlanguages there is always the\nproblem of how to portray them. It is\npossible to use the original language\nwith subtitles, or to use \"accents\" or\nseemingly not to bother at all.\n\"Elini\" seems to favour the latter and\nthis becomes rather annoying after a while.\nThe action takes place in different\ntimes which are inter cut as the story\nprogresses, one of these is the present\nday and the other is the time of the\nGreek civil war. Nicholas Cage\n(John Malkovich) is a New York\nTimes Journalist obsessed with\nfinding out how his mother came to\nbe executed by the communists\nduring the Greek civil war.\nThe film is based on a true story\nwritten by Mr Cage, and has, not\nunexpectedly, a very strong bias\nagainst the communists, who are\nplayed as ruthless and heartless.\nAlthough atrocities were perpetrated\nby both sides, this film only deals\nwith the one viewpoint. The idea of\nthe struggling poor peasant life\nbecomes a little hard to swallow after\na while. The accents were bad,\neveryone, whether Greek,\nHungarian, Czechoslovakian or\nAmerican spoke in American. There\nis a spoof, well at least a humourous\nhomage to the great swashbuckling\nmovies.\nWalter Matthau makes a marvellous Captain Red, who looks\nthe part exactly, his movement and\ngestures are the films' strong point\nand he does much to redeem an\notherwise disappointing film. His\naccent is of Walt-Disney Cockney\nbut he is not helped by a weak script.\nHe gets his teeth into some good\nscenes, for example after an\nunsuccessful mutiny aboard a Spanish ship, he is compelled to eat a boiled rat!\nSet adrift in the ocean, Captain\nRed and his companion, Frog, are\npicked up by a Spanish Galleon\nreturning from lucrative raids on the\nAmericas. The ship contains\nsomething to interest both Captain\nRed and Frog; a golden throne and a beautiful girl. The story then tells of\nthe attempts of Captain Red to\nobtain the throne, and Frog the girl.\nThere are some wonderful set\npieces and delightful cameo roles,\nparticularly Roy Kinnear\ncomplaining about the bottom\ndropping out of the hostage market.\nPolanski's direction is straight and\nthe film lacks the imagination of the\nbest of his work, but it's a fun film\nand one that should not be\ncompletely ignored.\nPaul Mayersburg is a screenwriter\nof some note, having written both\n\"The Man Who Fell To Earth\" and\n\"Eureka\" for Nic Roeg. His debt to\nRoeg is evident from his first attempt at directing; \"Captive\". Thefilmhas\na lot of the intrigue and subtlety that\nis a scene in which the young\nNicholas is asking his mother\nwhether their father, who has been in\nthe States for some time, will be able\nto fly over to see him. The child asks\nthis question in a strong American\naccent, the irony of it detracting from\nthe film.\nHowever Peter Yates directs the\nfilm in an un fussy and uncluttered\nway, controlling both the\ndevelopment of the characters and\nthe narrative with skill. The acting is\nexcellent, particularly Kate Nelligan\nand Linda Hunt. John Malkovich's avenging angel is a little cool at times,\nbut nevertheless the film has some\nvery moving moments.\nAccents are also a problem in\nPolanski's film \"Pirates\", but it\ndoesn't really matter because the film\nRoeg delights in, and the multi-layer\nstory. It concerns the kidnapping of a privileged and sheltered child, Irina\nBrook, so that she may be\nbrainwashed to see the error and\nsham of her life.\nAs astra i gh forward narrative\nfilm, it is hard to believe, but as an\ni mag in it ive, almost operatic fantasy,\nit is the sort of film that is all too\ninfrequently seen these days. It is a brave but not altogether successful\nattempt that is not helped by some\npoor acting by all, except the\nexcellent Oliver Reed.\nFinally, well worth a mention is\nthe collection of short animated films\nat the ICA under the banner of\n\"Alchemists of the Surreal\", worth\nseeing it only for the astonishing\n\"Dimension of Dialogue\".\nip in w n the Reality of Reaffiliatlon\nOne of the issues foremost in the\nminds of the tiny minority of\nImperial students who give a damn\nabout the Union, or at least its\npolicies, is that of whether the\nUnion should rejoin the NUS.\nOstensibly, the argument is about\nmembership fees and a say in the\nvoice of a national body, but the\nissue is really about politics. Of\ncourse, membership fees do have an\neffect on the debate, but those who\nargue that we should stay out\nbecause of these want to stay out for\na deeper un 'er lying reason. This is\nrather like the Alliance policy on\nproportional representation; they\nsay that they want it because it is\nmore democratic, but in reality they\nwant it less for the democracy and\nmore for the extra power that it\nwould give them, and like the Tories\nclaiming that they don't want\nsanctions against South Africa\nbecause they would harm the black\nworkers, rather than saying that\nthey would not like to see the white\ngovernemnt fall. This article will try\nto explain, in terms of the\nunderlying motives mentioned\nabove, why IC Union will never be a willing member of the NUS.\nThe NUS is, almost by definition,\na left-wing body. There are two\nmain reasons for this. Firstly most\nstudents are, by virtue of their\ndegrees, destined to join the upper\nranks of the establishment as\npoliticians, businessmen, army\nofficers and suchlike. Due to\ngenetics, money and nepotism, their\nchildren will make up the majority\nof future students, and thus the\nfuture backbone of the establish-ment. Therefore, most of today's students are likely to have\nrespectable middle class parents-people who are members of, and\nhave a vested interest in, the\nestablishment. For a students'\nunion to hold the same views as\nthose prevailing in the establishment\nwould be for it to lay itself open to\nthe criticism that it was merely\nbleating out the views of its\nmembers' parents like a faithful\nsheep, and that it was supporting the\nestablishment because of its vested\ninterest. It is human nature for\nyoung adults to demonstrate their\nindependence from their parents in\na variety of ways, and so the NUS\nholds extreme left-wing views in\norder to give itself credibility as an\nindependent, free-thinking body.\nThis it can afford to do because\nneither it, nor its members have\nmany real responsibilities and have\nnot had the complexity and\ndifficulty of real life to disillusion\nthem.\nBy becoming scientists, the\nstudents at Imperial have chose r to\nstudy the interactions between the\nforces of nature, rather than those\nbetween people. Since politics is\nabout people, the vast majority of\nthose at Imperial are apathetic\nabout politics. They don't care, so\nlong as they're left to do their own\nthing. Right-wingers believe in\nfreedom to do your own thing,\ncapitalism and minimal government\ninterference, left-wingers in helping\nthose less clever/rich/fortunate\nthan oneself and holding things in\ncommon for the common good.\nThis makes most people at Imperial\nright wing, not by high moral\nprinciple but by coincidence, but\nright wing just the same.\nLeft wingers have a profound\ndislike of scientists, and any other\nkind of expert, for that matter. (If\nyou don't believe me read the\nGuardian). This is because they are\nin d is pensi ble and yet more\ninterested in their field of expertise\nthan in politics and therefore not\neasily susceptible to the control that\nhas to be exercised in a coi.,mon\nownership socialist environment.\nThis distrust is well illustrated by the\nfact that each unit in the Red Army\nhas a political commissar who,\nbefore the war, was senior to the\nunit com m mander; and also the fact\nthat the Labour Party does not trust\nour nuclear scientists to keep our\nreactors safe. This distrust and\ndislike is reciprocated by the\nscientists and the experts. I wonder\nhow many Red Army commanders\nlike their political commissars or\nhow many CEGB scientists will be\nvoting Labour.\nIt is thus short-sighted and naive\nto believe that an inherently rightwing scientific group of people such\nas Imperial College Union could\nhave a meaningful and sincere\naffiliation with a body so inherently\nleft wing, unsympathetic and\nuninterested in its views as the NUS.\nOf course it might become\nfinancially attractive to join, or the\nleadership of the Union might\npersuade the members to join on the\ngrounds that everybody else has, but\nunless the NUS changes radically, it\nwill never represent, sym pathis e or\ntake an interest in the views of the\nmembers of ICU.\nFrancis Miers\nPhysics 1\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday October 10th19868 THEATRE\nBreaking The\nMusical\nMould\nCabaret\nSerious theatre-goers in London\nare being forced to the far flying\nrecesses of the Royal Court,\nSloane Square and the Lyric and\nRiverside studios in Hammersmith whilst the West End is\nstuffed full of vacant, commercial farce and musicals.\nCabaret at the Strand theatre\nAldwych has been running for a few months now, and is a brave\nattempt at breaking the London\nmu sci al mould. It employs all the\nusual techniques; expensive\nsets, dazzling costume and\nintensive choreography etc, but\nit does have an advantage over\nthe likes of Chess in having a prom in ant storyline. The Heroine is nightclub singer and\nhostess Sally Bowles (Kelly\nHunter) who falls for a visiting\nEnglishwoman, however there\nare a few interesting sub-plots\nand some stunning musical\nnumbers to stop it degenerating\ninto a run of the mill show. As it\nstands Cabaret is good entertainment.\nHowever there is no way that\nthis stage-production can avoid\nbeing compared to the cult-status movie version starring\nLiza Minelli and suddenly it\nstarts to look weak. One of the\nstrengths of the film is the way it\nshows the naivety and decadence of Berliners in the\n30's against the terrifying rise of\nthe Nazis. This was a vital\nelement in Christopher Isherwoods short stories upon\nwhich the whole musical was\nbased. The stage version has\nignored this and tried to cover-up the gaps left with glitter.\nThe characters have, on the\nwhole, become weak and\nromanticized, with the exception\nof Wayne Sleep at the Master of\nceremonies, although it is a virtual impersonation of Joel\nGrays film portrayal, Kelly\nHunter still manages to make the\naudience tingle with her\nrendition of the song Cabaret.\nLondon Musicals are not\ncheap to see, but if you want to\nsplash out on one then I would\nrecommend Cabaret. However a far more tempting alternative\nwould be to track down a late-night showing of the Liza\nMinnelli version in a seedy\ncinema somewhere, Sally\nBowles, after all, would have felt\nfar more at home there.\nLiz Holford\nMUSIC\nSonerous\nTunes\nAnyone acquainted with the\nHawklords album of the late 70's will have a soft spot for the\ncreative poetry and sonorous\ntunes of Robert Calvert. Those\nwho make it to this unusual site\nfor a rock concert could not have\nbeen disappointed. The choice\nof venue was probably made\nbecause of the fine acoustics of\nthe hall, but it did result in\nsurprised reactions from the\ncollar and tie staff as they\naccepted tick ts from a mixture of\nhippies, leather clad individuals\nand the rare normal looking\nperson. Incidentally, Calvert fits\ninto none of these categories\nwith his white suit and hat and\ngolden megaphone. Having said\nall that, I did notice that they (the\nSouth Bank staff) did seem to\nenjoy the mixture of music and\npoetry that is a Calvert concert.\nCalvert's band were called\n'Crankshaft' but infact were\n'Maximum Effect' who in turn are\nthe Turnerless 'Inner City Unit'\nwho played at Imperial last year.\nThe first half of the set involved\nmany renditions from, lucky Leif,\nCaptain Lockhead, Hype, and\nold Calvert-written Hawkwind\nnumbers. The second half saw a large section from his latest\nalbum which seems to have a large preoccupation with\nembryonic experimentation.\nThis section was very melodic.\nThe high point for me was\nwhen they played 'Spirit of the\nAge' where they managed better\nthan at Hawkwind concerts.\nIndeed all the Hawkwind\nnumbers (Psi Power, Damnation\nAlley, Flying Doctor, Days of the\nUnderground, Quark Strangeness and Charm) showed how\nsorely Hawkwind miss Calvert's class.\nHis next concert is at the\nClarendon, Hammersmith on\nNovember 21. To the un in it i a tied I say-Go and see it!\nREVIEWS BOOKS\nGraham\nGreene: Sad,\nNutty,Droll,\nMystified\nGetting a degree from St\nAmbrose College, Oxford, is a lot more laid back then the IC\nequivalent. Tuition by post-fees\nin advance of course, returnable\nif you fail (no one has ever been\nknown to) and degree-diplomas\nawarded after three terms study.\nThis little swindle is slickly\nnarrated by Graham Green in his\nCollected Short Stories\u2014an\nomnibus of thirty-seven tales\nculled from earlier selections. It\nis complimented by the other\nbizarre tales: sad, nutty, droll or\nmystical. Many of Green's novels\ngo through a dry and dull patch\nin the middle, but with these\nstories you get all the\nadvantages-the spectacular\nimagination, sensitivity and\ncharacter sketching-with none\nof the disadvantages of his\nverbosity. Riches of great delight\nmeet you and greet you within\nthese covers-the tale of the\nbeautiful pek in ese that goes fora\nnight romp in the dustbins with a length of intestine, or the slightly\nstrange aeroplane traveller who\nsaid he had a dead baby in his\novernight bag. There are also\nmore subtle, and slightly sad,\nstories, like Two Gentle People,\nwhere the right people, married\nto the wrong people, meet fifteen\nyears too late, or Cheap in\nAt/gus f another two lonely\npeople meeting in a Jamaican\nHotel, both needing friendship.\nGreen's Catholic faith is\nexplored in a number of stories\nsome comic, some serious, like\nSpecial Duties, where Miss\nSaunders, formerly head girl of\nthe Convent of Saint Latitudinaria, Woking, and winner\nthree years running of the\nspecial prize for piety, tours\nchurches earning indulgences\nfor her employer.\nAt \u00a33.95 this book works out at\nabout 10p per story; it's published by Penguin and\navailable at Waterstones, or you\ncould boog y on down to the\nPenguin Bookshop in Convent\nGarden. It's an excellent read for\nyourself or for anyone' s Christmas present.\nSara/7 Kirk\n\n"
