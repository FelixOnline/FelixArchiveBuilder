As Is I usual In the majority of these instances! the \"Sport\" consisted of removing a prominent object from one place an\" I depositing it in another. This tim the object concerned was the flag displayed outside the American kinder-garten opposite Guilds. The flag wr s then displayed, upside-down, from th a Guilds' flagpole. Later on the same afternoon the Guilds' president'< d to return the flag with abject pies. A few\ndays later, the present at the -who had actually go with him and cl pal and the eh ;\ngarten.

As a result of the s ltu at i.s et up by this Senate decree, when any\nstudent gets Into trouble, he has to take steps to make sure that reports of his misdeeds do not reach Senate\nHouse. To do this he has to place himself in the hands of the senior administration officials* It is this state of affairs which\nmakes the administration think that their whole purpose of being is not merely to ensure the smooth running of College activities, but to actually CONTROL these activities. When admin-is t ration takes over, on occasions, as in the Guilds' episode, mistakes are made through over estimation of of the gravity of the situation. Surely It Is best to let students settle affairs such as these in their own way, namely lightheartedly and\namicably, then all parties concerned\nwill know that any flag removing incidents are not political but are purely\" Sport!

Photographic Society was held from\nMarch U~8 th.in the Concert Hall. This new hall immediately showed its suitability for Exhibitions such as this by its spaciousness and good\nlighting. The entries were judged by Mr.R.H. Mason M.A.. F.R.P. S.,Art' Editor of the Amateur Photographer,\nwho spoke of the high standard of the colour transparencies, and said that' r rt ny of them were worthy of entry in larger competitions. The two main\nawards, the' Gla is ter Trophy1 for the best print of the Exhibition and the 'Huthen Cup' for the best portraiture were won by G.A. Matthews (3rd. year\nZoology) for a charming study entitled \u2022 ' Pensive'. In th s absence of Mr.Jfeson\nwho had to fly to the Leipzig Trade\nFair at very short notice,D r.E.G la is ter j:( C.&.G.) gave an extremely informative critique on the exhibits, during the public viewing on Monday evening. At the Society' s Annual Dinner held afterwards Dr.Heywood, a Past President of the Society, was the principal guest.

On the previous Saturday the A team\nhad visited the precincts of To tten ham where they met the Old Grammari an s fifteen, and achieved a clear cut victory. The most outstanding movement of the game, conceived at th a base of the scrum, was a scintillating run down the centre of the\nfield by Chris Rees, who,- after be a ting three men, presented Kim Ash with a beautiful pass, and the latter spurred on by exhortations from beh in d trundled majestically over the\nline to score his first try for ten years.

He was one of two in the tournament to have retained their titles. The previous night, he had also won\nhis bout In the InterCollegiate Boxing Championships for the Rector's Cup,\nwhich took place in the Concert Hall. A large crowd of spectators saw some\nexcellent contests, which, while not\nalways skilful, were certainly ox c it ln Both R.C.S. and Guilds had some\ndifficulty In raising teams, while the\nMines as usual overwhelmed both, Dy\nsheer weight of numbers, and easily walked away with the Rector's Cup.\nWinner of the tankard for the best boxer was Colin Clark of Guilds.

Battersea got in the first attack and came very close to scoring but the nI.C. held the opposing for wards and themselves started to attack. In this period of pressure Curtis had\nshots narrowly missing the goal, and\nI.C. were awarded a series of short corners but failed to score although Powell hit the ball very well. End\nto em' play continued throughout the\nfirst half and 3 attar sea, in one of\ntheir better raids on the I.C. goal, went she adjust before half tl me. Battersea had the best of the second\nhalf In which I.C. could produce only spasmodic attacks.

February, an interesting match was held against Thorpe Bay\nYacht Club at the Welsh Harp. In spite of an almost complete lack of win d,I.C. in the first race put themselves\nin a good position by team tactics, but later in the race one of our boats\nhad to retire, leaving us to finish in l st. and 4 th. positions. This gave\nThorpe Bay the first race, but we had\nrevenge in the second race with l st.,3 rd. and 6th. positions. Overall, this Just gave the match to Thorpe Bay by\n39 points to38 j, a grand finish.

A. always dressed \"properly\" whilst around the\nUnion, other Females (assumed to be associated\nwith I.C. men were\"improperly\" dressed (i.e. in slacks etc.). A notion was proposed from the .\nfloor to!\nthe effect that I. C.W.

The motion that \"the\nbitter be changed to \"Flowers'1\n' was carried by a comfortable majority, but the vote was preceded\nby surprisingly little discussion for such an\nimportant matter.\nFeelings ran high, however , on the question\nof a small lounge. It was announced that the\nSenior Common Room Committee bad decided not to\nmove to the third' floor, so that their present\nabode would not be available for student use, in particular to users of the Dining Hall (cries of\n\"shame\"). It was pointed out Ijhat this room was\nin a key position of the Union, and that many\nstudents have to walk through it daily. It was\nasked how many lounges the staff had. The President replied that ha believed that they had one\nin Ayrton Ball, and one In 179, Queens Sate,\nbesides the one- under discussion. From the floor\nit was remarked that the proportion of staff to\nstudent lounge accommodation ra a greatly in excess of the proportion of staff to students.\nMiss Cowgill proposed that a petition should be\norganised. Amid great acclaim, tarn President\nsuggested that Miss Cowgill should organise one.\nAfter the meeting a large body of students walked\nin protest through the lounge; they found mo members of the staff in occupation.\nI.C.S E IN RELAY EVANS MAKES FASTEST TIME\nThe ninth invitation Road Relay race organised by the CrossCountry Club took place last Saturday.

    "content": "FELIX3 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Much is wr; t ten in FELIX about the clubE\nand societies p.f th*? College, and we readily\nwelcome reports on activities. But other\nactivities exist at I.C.i. i* ides those sponsored by clubs: even L! una Hals no l nter S sts catered for by a Colle,-e clu h and surely\nthis must be rare - one is still a member of\na large club - Imperial College Union. This\nis primarily a social e.'. ub, and, besides\nproviding eating and drinking facilities, it provides a means whereby students can get\nto know each other and discuss matters other\nthan the subject which they are studying,\nthey can thus better their knowledge of the\nworld in which we live, and be bet t?r equipped to go into this outside world; in other\nwords, they obtain a fuller education.\nThis is not the only means of educating\noneself; experience, though a hard master,\nis thoroughly efficient. But we should consider ourselves fortunate that we, as stud-ents, have the opportunity to ease our path.\nIt might be said that one can obtain the\nbenefits of social intercourse elsewhere\nthan at the Union. Perfectly true, but surely facilities at I.C. are second to none,\nand one's everyday laboratory or workshop\ncompanions can provide a stepping-stone to\nfurther exchange of ideas, so broadening\none's outlook.\nAt the pr sent moment, the majority of\nI.C. students are so widely scattered over\nLondon, that many are discouraged from\nus ng \u2022he Unior, because they live or have\ndigs -o far away. The increased Hostel\naccommodation will ease this somewhat, but,\nof course, the ideal, but unfortunately impracticable e ol uti or, would be a fully residential College. Until this Eldorado\nis reached, a full University education at\nI.C. will always be beset w l th difficulties to be over coir. t.

We should like anyone who is a Liberal or just interested in the\nphilosophy to Join us. The easiest way of making contact is by means of\na note in the Union Rack but there are\nnotices about this proposal in the\nUnion and the Entrance Halls which you\nmay sign. Yours faithfully, K.E. Johnson.\nThe entrants to the Beard Competition are\nnow showing signs of their intrepid it y. An (\nannouncement will be made in the next Felix\n(in a week's time) of the Judging.\nNEW UNION DEBATED\n\"This House is disappointed in the design of\nthe new Union Building\" was the motion put before\nthe House by the chairman, Mr.T. Smith, on Tuea.\nday, 5th, March.\nMr.Joe Cooke opened the motion by considering\nthat we should be worthy of a building comparable\nto our status, as the loading technological collage in the country. Instead of a modem bu il ding we were saddled with on* where Insufficient\nthought had been exercised in the design. The\nlounge reminded him of the waiting room at\nPaddington as it appeared to be the only route\nbetween the refectory and bar, and the Concert\nHall, which was little better than many village\nhalls, was both too long and too narrow with the\nresult that tha stage was too far away for those\nseated at tha back of the auditorium.\nIn opposing the motion Mr. Jim Anderson explained that tha original plus war* drawn up in,1927 for only 1000 students, but wars shelved\nuntil 1953 when various student committees were\nasked to suggest amendments. Ha asked the House\nto consider that in the general expansion of I.C. with refectories and lounges not only centred\nabout tha Union but In Princer Cardans and on the\nMUSIC AT I.e. Dear Sir,I do not know whether Mr. Dixon is accurate in saying that music lovers at I.C. will be found at U.L. U. by the score, but I am quite sure that the facilities for music\nlovers at this collage axe outstandingly good.\nThey include lunch-hour recitals, General\nStudy lectures, and a record lending-library.\nThe Imperial College Choir is at present\nabout seventy five strong and need not fear\ncomparison with the L.u. M.s. Sopranos and\ncontraltos coming to the Choir from other\nColleges have told me that they have joined th\nthe I.C. Choir in preference to the L.U. M.S.A madrigal group has been started this term\nfor those who wish to learn more of the \"Golden\nAge of British Music\".\nInstrumentalists are catered for by the\nOrchestra, which is taking part in \"Trial by\nJury\" this term, and by chamber music groups.\nCoaching in chamber music is available and\nthose players of sufficiently high standard are\nencouraged to play at the lunch hour concerts.\nSeveral members of the I.C. Musical Society have\ntaken part in chamber music concerts at U.L. U. With all this activity hare at I.e.,I do not believe it is necessary for any I.C. man to go to Bloomsbury in search of music.\nYours etc.\nG.G. Pope.\n(Chairman, I.C. Choir)\nImperial institute site, the building should ba\nregarded as a clubhouse.\nMr. Fineh, seconding the notion, complained\nhe still waited 20 minutes for lunch wherever he\nwent. The Union was a\" bod ged up job\" with two\nstoreys stuck on top of the old building.\nSeconding the opposition, Mr. Dick Saunders\npointed out that most rooms were multipurpose\nand hence could not be expected to be as comfortable as If only designed for ona purpose.\nProm tha floor Mr. Allen suggested that al though the building did net fit la with the\nRoderic Kill building It still had s good basis\ndesign. Mr. Jarmin complained that there wars no\npara bol oid staircases, while Mr. Larkls suggested\nwe exchanged our building with ULD. Mr. Samacta\nwas surprised that the proposition wanted a or a corridors since these were both draught y and\nunsightly. Mr. Al-Kaaln who has \u2022 phobia against\nsitting In long narrow rooms such ss the lounge,\nregretted that the building was sot built In the\nsame functional style as the Roderic Hill building\nOn a division the motion was carried by 40\nvotes to 16.\nPRAISE \u2014 AT LAST I Dear Sir, Your correspondent g.R.I.( Elderly Registered Nurse?) sets out several points of\nobjection to our cat; I cannot leave them unanswered. He first refers to the dog-eared and dilapidated condition of his copy. I suspect that it waa second hand - if he bothers to buy bis own\nthis week he should find it in the same pristine\nand un sullied condition as that of most members\nof the Sales Staff.\nTo his second point,I would reply that if tha\ngentleman cannot afford a dictionary he will find\none in most public libraries. Most people at I.C. have passed School Certificate English, and this\nstandard ahould be sufficient to enable one to\nrealise that seventy words Is not a long sentence outside \"Comic Cuts\" and \"Dally Mirror\".\nThe medication of \"Felix\" would be superfluous.\nThe modern trend In toilet paper la towards softness and to use \"Felix\" as such would cause discomfort and possibly damage to the user (cf.\nGargantua).\nFinally, may I offer you my congratulations\non keeping up such a high standard in your paper;\nIn humour, serious comment, and accurate reporting\nI don't think any collage newspaper can beat It. Yours etc.,\nP. McLean.\nTHAT BAR ACAH1\nSear Sir, Thar* have recently been many speculations as to whether tha bar will be ktp t open.\ntill11 p.m. as it is licensed to do so. I think\nIt would be helpful if some official comment\ncould ba made on this subject, especially In\nvis* of tha fact that all the 'locals' are now\nopen till that tins.\nYours etc.,iD. Butters.\nMr. Kitchener states that the Bar is kept open till11 p.m. if and whan the\noccasion demands e.g. on the nights of\na dinner. Otherwise, it i a more trouble\nthan it is worth to keep open, particularly as most people oc mein only for about 20 minutes before dosing time,\nregardless of when this is. "
