    "content": "FELIX EDITOR Simon Banton proposed by Neil McCulloch\nGone are the days when Friday morning meant\nyou read Felix in 1st lecture to the exclusion of\nwriting notes. Nowadays the only person that\nlooks at Felix for more than 5 minutes is the\nlecturer who sees it drift past in the form of paper\ndarts. Some may say that Felix will always be this\ntedious. I say NOT SO! For 3 years I have beer-disappointed, along with many others, in Felix ant\nit has gone on long enough. If you elect me a; Editor I will re-vital is e our newspaper.\nThe essence of Felix is that it should provide a lively forum for the discussion of matters which\ninterest and affect students. It should have a balance between sports, clubs/societies, reviews,\nCCU reports et al. This much is obvious. What is\nnot so obvious, or easy to do, is give the proper\nFELIX EDITOR\nIn pursuit of what is honest and good in this\nCollege, Ajay Kapadia has decided to become\nnext year's FELIX editor. He discussed his\nplans with a special reporter.\nQ. Why are you standing for FELIX editor?\nA. During my time at College, the standard of\nFELIX has always been low. My journalistic\ninstinct assures me that I can achieve new heights.\nQ. What makes you the best candidate?\nA. I know what the job involves and I am able to\ncarry it out. My experience includes working as\nthis year's News Editor, responsible for filling two\nand a half pages every week.\nI believe in the independance of FELIX and, for\nthe sake of the newspaper, it must not be lost. I'm sure that nobody wants to read a paper that\nreports news about the same old people, or acts as\na voice box for College or any of the Unions.\nQ. How do you aim to make FELIX more\nattractive to its readers?\nFELIX EDITOR\nI'm writing this to point out a few things that\nmodesty prevents Hugh from saying himself. He is\nprobably the only properly experienced candidate\nstanding for this post, having worked on the\nproduction side of Felix for several years. This is\nimportant, not only because the Felix editor also\nhas to manage the Union Print Unit, but also\nbecause he will have to advise next year's handbook editors over the summer. This would\nnot be easy if he were inexperienced.\nBut Hugh is not just another Felix hack, he is\nvery concerned about getting more people\ninvolved. Having edited Spanner and Guildsheet I have seen the problems he will face and am\nconfident to propose Hugh Southey for Felix\nEditor.\nMark Cottle\nFELIX this year has not lived up to its full potential.\nIt hasn't been relevant to students and it hasn't been lively and innovative. How often has FELIX\nignored an event organised by your club or CCU?\nexposure to the news stories that do not leap out\nand bite the news staff on the ankle. College block\nand the Union can, and do, make decisions and\nlong term plans without any accountability to\nstudents as a whole. The only way to get at the real\nnews in I.C. is by incisive and investigative\ni our nal is m. You need to use every devious means\npossible to uncover the truth and this I intend to\ndo.\nIn conclusion, let me say I am not a Felix hack\nand as such I can bring a TOTALLY fresh\napproach to the job rather than a re-hash of what\nhas been mediocre before.\nFor a well-balanced, exciting and revealing Felix\nvote for me next Monday or Tuesday.\nSimon Bin ton\nHow often has FELIX bored you during first\nlectures? FELIX can'be improved and this how I would do it: *\n\u2022News This year FELIX has reported on boring\nnews about College staff and ignored student\nactivities. If I am elected FELIX editor the news\npages will be relevant.\n\u2022Comment The FELIX editorial can and should\nbe used to influence College. I am prepared to use\nit for students.\n\u2022Humour If elected editor I will ensure FELIX has\na regular diary column reporting on anything\namusing that happens in College. I will also\nencourage people to submit humourous articles\nand photographs.\nLack of space prevents me from continuing the\nlist. However the improvements I intend can be\nsummed by saying they are intended to make\nFELIX your newspaper rather than the newspaper\nof a few hacks and College administrators.\nHugh Southey\nA. Simply by including articles that students\nwant to read. News is obviously of utmost\nimportance. I want this to be amusing, well\nresearched and not always run of the mill.\nArticles on issues particularly relevant to\nstudent life in London will become regular\nfeatures.\nInformation is valuable and hard to come by in a large city. I want to include not only information\nabout what's available at College but also what's available throughout London.\nQ. How would you implement these\nchanges?\nA. There are many people in College who have\nnever thought of researching, writing or drawing\nfor FELIX. I want to encourage all students to\nbring their ideas to me. The talent is hidden out\nthere, somewhere.\nMy goal is to make everyone feel that FELIX is\ntheir paper.\nAjay Kapadia\nAjay Kapadia proposed by Peter Hands\nHugh Southey proposed by Mark Cottle\nThe full list of candidates fully proposed and seconded on\nFriday 1 March at 5.30pm was:\nPresident\nCarl Burgess\nGareth Pritchard\nGra ham Thorpe\nAllan Trench\nDeputy President\nDavid Kingston\nDavid Sharpe (withdrawn)\nHon Sec\nAndy Belk (withdrawn)\nQuentin Fontana\nAidan Jennery\nFelix Editor\nSimon Banton\nMark Cottle (withdrawn)\nAjay Kapadia\nHugh Southey\n10 Friday 8 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CLETTERS\nOUR\nMascotry\nDear Sir,\nOver the years which I have spent here at\nIC (three and a half). I have seen and read\nabout many incidents where this infantile\npastime known as mascot ry has caused\ndamage, injury and offence. Last week's example affected my club and myself directly,\nand has moVed me to write to you.\nThe disablement of the yellow union van\nlast week was the cause of the cancellation of\na planned ICY HA trip to Dartmoor. This\nupset the weekend plans of our members,\nwho were very upset about it, and also\nresulted in lost revenue of about \u00a340 to the\nYouth Hostelling Association of England\nand Wales. We were very fortunate in that the\nwardens of the Youth Hostels at which we\nintended to stay agreed that we need not pay\nthem. If they had not been sympathetic,\nICY HA would have lost the money, as well.\nNeedless to say, I am very angry about the\nwhole occurrence, and would be delighted to\nsee this pointless and stupid tradition of\nmascot ry stopped. If the participants wish to\nlet off steam in a competitive manner, would\nit not be better done in a squash court or on a Rugby pitch, while innocent members of the\npublic could avoid them? At the moment, I can only see mascot ry giving students a bad\nname, and costing members of the public\nmoney and inconvenience.\nI would be interested to see someone give a good argument in favour of mascot ry, and\nwill eagerly scan future pages of FELIX. While I appreciate that last week's incident\nwas caused by Q MC,I cannot see that other\nperpetrators of the 'sport' are any less to\nblame.\nYours disgusted,\nS Eriksen\nPresident ICYHA\nBlatant\nElectioneering\nDear Sir,\nMany students were pleased to have the\nopportunity to attend the '21st Century\nTechnology' symposium last week. The\n\u00a3120/head conference was designed to give\nleading members of the college a chance to\nspeculate what the future would hold for\ndifferent areas of technology. Many of the\npresentations were good, two of them were\nvery poor indeed. The lecturers concerned\ndidn't stick to their subjects, had poorly\npresented slides, occasionally out of\nsequence, and delivered the material in a very\nuninspiring way.\nThe lecturers should have realised that\nthey can't have the same attitude towards\npre se nations to leading members of industry\nas they have towards students, who only sit\nthrough badly prepared, boring lectures\nbecause of the prospect of forthcoming\nexams.\nIt is time, surely, that college ac knowle ged the fact that being an 'expert' does not make\n\u2022you a good lecturer. The teaching standards\nof the college could be improved so easily by\ncompulsory short courses in 'the\npresentation of ideas and technical\ninformation'.\nThese could be enhanced by using video\nrecordings to enable lecturers to see and hear\nwhat they are like. Fellow staff would be able\nto give constructive comments. The majority\nof students already do such a course and most\nfind it a great help.\nThe cost in time and money would be\nminimal compared with the benefit of more\nefficient teaching and better communication\nwith industrialists.\nYoursfaithfully\nRoger MH Preece\nElec Eng Dep Rep\nThatcheration\npoint\nDear Sir,\nLast Wednesday Margaret Thatcher\nvisited Imperial College, ^ou could be\nforgiven for not having noticed.\nLet me remind you that she is the head of a government which is in the process of cutting\nfunds to education\u2014universities in particular\u2014to an extent that both teaching\nand research quality are bound to fall: in\nsome cases probably never to recover.\nDid the Student Union publicise the Prime\nMinister's visit, or organise a demonstration?\nHow about the Socialist Society or Labour\nClub? Or perhaps C ND? Or any single\norganisation that might have reason to\ndisagree with current government policies?\nDid They Hell.\nIn the end a small but noisy crowd that was\ndisorganised and badly misinformed was left\nto form\u2014more by luck than planning. But\nthough we may have been amateur, at least\nwe were there.\nI draw two alternative conclusions. The\nfirst is that the lack of efficiency and ability in\nthe groups mentioned above is so great that\nthey could do nothing; the second is that their\napathy is so great that they would do nothing.\nIf the former charge is correct, that's terrible. If its the latter, thats downright\ndisgraceful. I wonder whether anyone here\ncares?\nYours faithfully,\nMatthew Freman\nFELIX\nVote,\nfor me\nYou must have already have seen the huge\nnumber of election posters and handouts\nstrewn over the campus. And in the next few\ndays you will, no doubt, see many more.\nIt is not for me, tempting though it is, to\ncomment on what the sabbatical candidates\nhave to say. You must make up your own\nminds. But what I do say is that you should\nvote. You should register your opinion, even\nif it is only to write ABSTAIN across the\nballot paper.\nPeople often speak about apathy in the\nstudent body. But the worst sort of apathy is\nthe sort that leaves your opinion unregistered\nand tars you with the same brush as the small,\nbut vociferous minority who believe that they\nrepresent your views.\nRemember: your vote counts.\nAs is usual towards the end of term, there will\nbe no FELIX next Friday. The last issue of\nterm will appear on Wednesday 20 March.\nThe copy deadline for this issue will be\nWednesday 13 for Diary, Small Ads and club\narticles, and Friday 15 for letters.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Gren,\nDave,Pimilico Connection, Dave Clements,\nKishor, Jon, John, Pete, Andy, Martin, Paul\nJowitt, Michael, Don, Alan, Chris, Nigel,\nPeter, all the colla tors and Rosemary and\nTony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

    "content": "FEATURED\nScience Fiction\n'The Imperial Stormtroopers were\nclosing in, their blaster fire getting\ncloser to the base. It was time to leave.\nHan. Solo lifted his gun and shouted,\n'Move it out'. The Rebel group leapt from\ncover and raked the oncoming troops\nwith fire. Han's gun spat deadly laser\nbolts. He hit two troopers full in the\nchest and they went down. Two nearby\nRebels were split asunder by the heavy\ncal libre fire of the Imperials. It was time\nto get out of there'.\nThat is how many people enc outer science\nfiction, in the form of the special effects\nextravaganzas of the cinema. Recent films\nlike the Star Wars trilogy, Buck Rogers and\ntelevison shows like Dr Who and Space 1999\nare indeed what most people think science\nfiction is all about\u2014flashy hardware,\ncardboard characters, thin plots but lots of\nmindless simplistic action to make up for it.\nOh, and superb, expensive special effects.\nMost SF films and TV series are in fact like\nthis, and all of them are pretty crap.\nThe home of science fiction, however, is\nnot the screen but the printed page, and the\nscreen version of SF, despite a few notable\nexceptions, lags about 50 years behind the\nbooks.\nScience fiction first came into its own in\nthe magazines of the twenties and thirties\nwith such titles as Amazing Science Fiction.\nThese featured mainly the whizz-bang-zap\nkind of science fiction common in today's cinema.\u2014This was neither scientific nor\nparticularly good fiction, but did introduce a lot of people to the idea of setting stories in\neither the future , or alternative worlds.\nThree noted, and possibly infamous, stars of\nthis per oid were EE 'Doc' Smith, Robert E Howard and L Ron Hubbard. Smith's horrifying ly awful Skylark and Lensman\nseries are still staple fodder for many young\nSF fans, all of whom later complain how bad\nhis stories are. Howard too will never be\nforgotten, nor forgiven, for his creation\nConan the Barbarian, who has recently\nstepped into the cinema in some pretty dire\nfilms. Hubbard though went from writing\nawful science fiction to founding the pretty\nawful religion of Scientology. He then died\nand is now more or less for gott on( thank\nGod!).\nHowever during this period, known to\nmany SF fans as the Golden Age, some\nauthors started to use science fiction in a more grown up way. Two distinct schools\ngrew up, which have now become\nrespectively known as hard and soft science\nfiction.\nThe first of these to arise was hard SF. Its\nfounding fathers were Isaac Asimov, Robert\nHeinlein and to a lesser extent, Arthur C Clarke. The basic idea behind hard science\nfiction is science. The hard authors usually\ntake a few interesting scientific ideas, like\nmachines that think or black holes, and see\nwhere this takes them. The usual source of\nideas for hard SF is hard science, like physics\nor astronomy. In this sort of work, the people\nin the stories are usually secondary to the\nideas, and so character is at ions are\nsometimes rather wooden. Hard science\nfiction writers are often scientists\nthemselves. Robert Forward, a physicist at\nBell Labs, in fact published a paper on a device he worked out for use in his books\nDragon's Egg. Hard science fiction ruled\nsupreme throughout the late 40's and 50's with such classics as Asi'mou's Foundation\ntrilogy and Heinlein's Starship Troopers.\nWith the 60's however, change come in the\nform of the English authors Brian Aldiss, JG Ballard and Michael Moorcock. They came\nfrom a literary rather than a scientific\nbackground, and concentrated on the more\nhuman aspects of the world. Where science\nwas involved at all it was generally ecology or\npsychology. The advent of these, and other,\nauthors created soft science fiction, more\nusually termed New Wave. The spearhead of\nthe New Wave in the late 60's was the\nmagazine New Worlds, edited by Michael\nMoorcock. This and the whole of the New\nWave was dominated by the attitudes of the\nhippy culture of the time, and concentrated\non such themes as mind-changing drugs,\nanti-war protests, eastern rel gions and\necology. Most of the New Wave soft SF is set\nin the near future as opposed to the vast time\nscales frequently involved in hard SF. The\nNew Wave also served to vastly increase the\nliterary quality of science fiction, and\nencouraged experimentation in style.\nOccasional disasters came as a result of this,\nsuch as the nearly unreadable Barefoot In\nThe Head by Brian Aldiss. However, this\nexperimentation also lead to the breakdown\nof the barriers between hard and soft SF and\nbetween SF and the rest of mainstream\nfiction. As a result of this certain of the New\nWave authors are now among the most\nacclaimed of modern writers. Indeed JG Ballard nearly won last year's Booker prize.\nIn the two decades since the New Wave,\nscience fiction has settled down again, with\nthe soft and hard merging into a homogenous whole. It may be that the time is\nripe for a new revolution in style, since many\nauthors have taken to rehashing old ideas in\nthe form of long, immensely tedious series.\nFrank Herbert, who first added hard and soft\nSF to get the fabulous Dune, has fallen foul of\nthis sequel disease. The sixth Dune book has\njust been published and a seventh is on its\nway. The signs are bright through, with new\nauthors such as Bill Gibson (in his book\nNeuromancer) returning to the originality\nthat distinguishes the best in science fiction.\nTomorow, Saturday 9 March in the Bot Zoo\nCommon Room, IC SF Soc brings you our\nvery own science fiction convention\n\u2014PICOCON. Starting at 10.00am and\ncontinuing to 10.00pm( at least), PICOCON\nwill give you the chance to sample the best in\nscience fiction. There will be a host of video\nfilms, two guest speakers, games\ndemonstrations and more.\nThe Days timetable is:-10.00am Registration\n10.15am Monty Python Live at the\nHollywood Bowl\n11.45am Charades Game\u2014SFSOC vs\nASTROSOC\n12.15pm Lunch and Treasure Trap\ndemonstration\n1.00pm Star Wars\n3.00pm First Speaker Gerry Web\n4.00pm Empire Strikes Back\n6.00pm Second Speaker\u2014Dave Langford\n7.00pm Blade Runner\n9.00pm Dreamscape\n10.30pm Close of convention\nThroughout the convention we will have\ntwo computers running games such as the\naward-winning ELITE by Acornsoft.\nRefreshments will also be available all day.\nNow for a bit of data on our speakers:\nGerry Web is a long standing member of the\nBritish Interplanetary Society, a group\nspearheaded by Arthur C Clarke in the 30's and 40's. Gerry has worked on the Daedalus\nProject and now runs a firm of space science\nconsultants. He is also a longstanding fan of\nscience fiction. Dave Langford is also a long\ntime fan of SF, and is now a full time writer.\nThe Critical Mass column in White Dwardf\nmagazine is his most well known face, but he\nhas also written The Space Eater, War in\n2080 and The Leaky Establishment, in which\nhe drew on his experiences of work at\nAldermarston. Dave's talk last year was so\nentertaining that we've asked him back for\nmore.\nSo there it is PICOCON PI, 12 hours of\nscience fiction experiences all for only \u00a32.50.\n'\u2022'mat more could you ask for?\nlew worlds!\nFELIX Friday 8 March 1985 11\n\n"

    "content": "DEPUTY PRESIDENT Dave Kingston proposed by Hugh Stiles\nWho is Dave Kingston?\nWell, he is a third year Mathematician who has\nbeen heavily involved in the less glamourous side\nof Union life\u2014posts he has been elected to so far\nare social rep., dep. rep., safety rep., and GUC\ndelegate. He has also been awarded RCS social\ncolours. However, he is aware of the problems\npresently confronting the Major Sub Committees\nin spite of his C CU roots and has a good\nknowledge of ICU, having been a regular face in\nthe Union Office over the last 12 months.\nThat's why I am proposing Dave for Deputy\nPresident.\nHugh Stiles\nThe Deputy President is responsible for the\nmanagement of ICU's resources\u2014finance, and\nthe use and maintenance of the Union\nbuilding\u2014as well as refectories, our mascot Mike,\nand being Safety Officer. The most important of\nthese is finance.\nFinance\nNext year's Deputy President will have a difficult\nHON SEC\nIf you are looking for an efficiently working, well coordinated Union next year then I am the obvious\nchoice for the ICU Hon Sec . The post is largely\nconcerned with the administration of the Union\nand ensuring that every thing runs efficiently from\nUGM's and Council to organising the Union\ntransport and as such requires someone with\nexperience of working with people and an in depth knowledge of how a university works. I have these\nqualifications having worked for several years\nbefore coming to IC and having been associated\nwith universities in various capacities for a long\ntime. A sabbatical post in IC Union is not as some\npeople imagine, a simple extension of aCC U or\nMSC post, it goes much deeper than that as it is a full time job with the resp on sib lit y that goes with it.\nCommitment to the job is of vital importance as is\nHONSEC\nThe post of I.C.U. Honorary Secretary is largely\nadministrative and is therefore apolitical. It\ninvolves taking and producing minutes of various\ncommittee meetings, the running of the Union\ntransport system, upkeep of the Union Insurance\nPolicies and the conducting of Union Elections.\nHowever, the job is not as simple as it looks, and\nis expanding all the time. The Union transport\nsystem is requiring more and more time to\norganise, dealing with hire companies, as well as\nlooking after the Union's vans. Much time at the\nbeginning of term is taken up with updating the\nInsurance Policies to ensure all Union's equipment\nis properly insured.\nThere are also other duties of the Hon. Sec; the\nproduction of the Union Directory and Union\ncards, lia sing with the Union Solicitor as well as\nmany other minor tasks. If the Hon Sec is\nne g le gent then the administrative system of the\nUnion will collapse and chaos will be unavoidable.\njob. Yet again the Union is facing a reduction in\ndisposable income\u2014the money spent mainly on\nclubs and CCU's. Already this has provoked\narguments between the Major Sub Committees\n(the bodies who oversee most clubs' activities) and\nthe CCU's over next year's funding. This rift is\ndeflecting this year's Deputy President from the\njob of trying to obtain as much money as possible\nfrom College. Quite clearly an end to this split is\nneeded. A lead in this direction has to come from a Deputy President who has a wide knowledge of all\naspects of ICU, yet is not tightly connected with\nany pressure group. I think that I fit the bill.\nRefectories\nImprovement in refectories is possible next year\nwith a new refectory manager and the proposed\nJCR/Sherfield refectory swap.\nMascotry\nI would like to see Mike appear in public more\noften.\nDave Kingston\nQuentin Fontana proposed by Simon Chamberlain\nen thus iam and reliability, all qualities that I feel I have in abundant quantities which will enable me\nto carry out the job effectively and with the\nminimum of fuss. Don't waste your vote, vote for\nme as ICU Hon Sec.\nQuentin Fontana\nAidon Jennery proposed by Estelle Simpson\nIf you decide that the Union needs to be run as\nsmoothly as possible with a competent and\nefficient Hon. Sec. then vote for me.\nI have had much experience of committee\nmeetings and administration, being RCSU\n\"BROADSHEET\" editor, SCIENCE FICTION\nSOCIETY chairman and Miscellaneous Clubs\nRepresentative on the S. C.C. exec. I am not an\nI.C.U. \"hack\" and can therefore breathe new life\ninto what is mainly a routine job. I can look at the\nadministrative system objectively and update it if\nneeds be.\nI have the drive and enthusiasm to refresh the\nUnion, and make it work as completely and\nefficiently as possible for the ordinary student.\nIn short, if you want an Hon. Sec who will do the\njob as it should be done, then vote for me, AIDON\nJENNERY on 11th or 12th March.\nAidon Jennery\nSabbatical elections\nVoting 11th&12 th March\nResults UGM 14th March\nFELIX Friday 8 March 1985 9\n\n"

    "content": "EFEATURE\nPIMLICO\nDear Student,\nWould you like to teach science to\nchildren in an Inner London School next\nyear?\nIf so the Pimlico Connection is the society\nfor you. We send about eighty tutors to six\nlocal schools every Wednesday afternoon\nduring the Autumn Term and for four weeks\nor so in the Spring Term. The ages of the kids\nrange from five to seventeen and the subjects\ninclude Maths, all the Sciences, English,\nDesign and Technology and Computing\u2014so\nthere's bound to be something to suit you!\nGenerally the tutoring involves a commit t ment of two to three hours per week\n(two classes). The teacher still takes the\nlesson so don't worry, you won't be left with\nthirty screaming kids to look after. You are\nthere more as a helper and confidante to the\nkids than a teacher figure.\nThe presence of extra people to answer\nquestions means that the kids are able to\nlearn more and frequently they actually enjoy\nlessons more because of it. Indeed it is also\nvery rewarding for tutors to see children\nprogress in their knowledge.\nAnother benefit that tutors gain is a development of their ability to communicate\nscientific ideas to people less knowledgeable\nthan themselves. It certainly brings you\ndown to earth with a bump when you have to\nexplain how to do division without a calculator (a difficulty I had!). Such skills are\nvery often vital to getting ideas across when\nyou finally get into work and certainly if you\nwant to be a teacher/lecturer.\nIf you are interested come along to our\n(free) recruitment lunch in Elec Eng 606 on\nTuesday 12 March where there will be a chance to talk to this year's tutors. If you are\nunable to make it contact me (Elec Eng 3) or\nDavid Berry (53, Princes Gate) and we'll be\npleased to give you further details.\nI 'll just leave you with some comments\nmade by this year's tutors in response to the\nquestion;\n'What do you like most about tutoring?'.\n\u2022Seeing previously indifferent children\nbecome more interested and involved in\npractical science.\n\u2022The feeling of doing something useful with\nmy Wednesday afternoons.\n\u2022Talking to the kids about things and finding 1\nout their views.\n\u2022It was extremely satisfying to help children\nunderstand fundamental principles.\n\u2022The kids were lively and good fun.\n\u2022 Meeting people from different\nbackgrounds.\n\u2022Gaining insight into the teacher\u2014pupil\nrelationship\n\u2022The enthusiasm that the kids showed for us\nwhen we arrived at the start of the afternoon.\n\u2022I found it a challenge which was very\nrewarding.\nI think they speak for themselves! Hope to\nsee or hear from you soon.\nGraham Youngs\nChairman\n6 Friday 8 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "fake a Walk \u00a9o wi} The Goethe\nNEWS FEATURED\nYes, another week means another walk down Exhibition Road.\nThere are rumours that some IC students haven't even found\nExhibition Road yet, never mind the National Sound Archive or\nthe Mormon Chapel. Undaunted, this issue FELIX takes a look at\nthe Goethe Institute.\nThe Goethe Institute was\nfounded in 1951 with the aim of\npromoting German language\nand culture throughout the\nworld, and is modelled on similar\nlines to the British Council. It is\nlargely funded by the West\nGerman Government, and\nemploys 3500 staff at 135\nbranches in 65 countries, one of\nwhich is at 50 Princes Gate on\nExhibition Road.\nThere are many facilities of the\nInstitute that are of interest to\nstudents at IC, especially because\nmany students have taken or are\ntaking German as an academic\nsubject, and do not want to lose\ntheir skill through lack of use.\nO Goethe-ln\nLanguage Department\nThe Institute runs courses in\nGerman at all levels. Some are at\nvery convenient times for\nstudents, who also get a discount\non the course fee.\nThe Library\nThe Institute has a library of over\n26,000 books which may be\nborrowed by the public at no\ncharge, and these include classics\nof German literature as well as\ngeneral reading. There are also\nGerman periodicals, newspapers\nand cuttings from the British\npress about German affairs.\nTHE\nTOPSY-TURVY\nWORLD\nA forthcoming\nexhibition at the\nGoethe Institute.\nMoralSatire and\nNonsense in the\nPopularPrint\nEvents\nThe Institute mounts events\naimed at encouraging and\nspreading German culture. In\nconjunction with the National\nFilm Theatre they are presenting\na series of German musicals of\nthe 30s and 40s starring Lillian\nHarvey, and are helping with the\nAlmeida Theatre's current\nproduction of Man Equals Man\nby Brecht. The many films they\nshow normally have subtitles in\nEnglish or simultaneous translation, and include the best\nin German art films. Admission\nfor students is negligible\ncompared to the prices of a trendy art cinema, for example\nHadrich's superb Der Stechlin is\nbeing screened over the next\nthree Monday evenings (so you'll\nhave to hurry) and the price for\nthe entire four-and-a half hours\nis only 50p for students.\nThe Institute is careful not to\nbe seen as ag gres iv ely pushing\nGerman and Germany, but an\nawareness campaign is being\nplanned to raise its profile. Even\nif you don't speak German and\nfeel that you can not afford the\ntime to learn, there is much at 50\nPrinces Gate that may be of\ninterest.\nUnd das Beste am GoetheInstitut ist, daB es nur ein p aar Schritte vom College weg ist\u2014in\nExhibition StrafJe. \u2022\nFELIX Friday 8 March 1985 5\n\n"

The second\nteam played away this week in a room that passed as a dry sauna.\nIt being so hot that at some times\nthe ball was carried on a cushion\nof hot air above the table, so\nmaking a safe shot missed.\nHowever they overcome these\nproblems with valour and won 7-2.

The\nteam rode exceptionally well\ntogether and covered the first\ntwelve and a half miles in 29\nminutes. The final time was one\nhour two minutes.

The problem\nwith the old refectories is the food, not their\nsurroundings. I find it hard to believe that\nmoving the Site of cooking the food a few feet\ncloser to the serving area and installing new\nchairs, tables, etc. will vastly improve its\nquality!\nObviously a smart refectory serving 'good'\nfood would be a very cons pico us asset to the\ncollege, while spending money on student\naccommodation would be appreciated by\nstudents, but students only!\nYours faithfully,\nP Barry\nBiochem 3\n, CM\n^ AUf Ht\\Gi\nUSE\nS*7^ Edit\nEXPO\nJ3\n4\n6\n0\nPHOTO\n/\u2022HO\"\nImperial College Dramatic Society presents\nJohn Osborne's LOOK BACK Wed 13th to Sat 16 March\n7.30pm Union Concert Hall\nBeit Quad\nPrince Consort Road, SW7\nTube: South Kensington\nNo. 9 bus to Albert Hall\nLook Back In Anger\nThe arrival of Look Back In Anger on the British\nstage caused a sensation.

    "content": "Founded 1949\nQMCfooled in\nambush bluff\nTwentyfiveQueen Mary College students were ambushed in Beit\nQuad last Wednesday afternoon by a Guilds squad, in retaliation\nfor a recent QMC attack on an ICU minibus.\nQMC were led to believe that\nthey would be taking part in a joint raid with Chelsea College\non the IC Union Office.\nThe raid was planned on\nWednesday morning by C& GU.\nMaribel Anderson, Guilds\nPresident, rang QMC posing as\nAmber Russel, Chelsea College\nRag Chairman. Maribel asked\nQMC what time the raid would\ntake place and was told that no\ndetails had been finalized but\nthat QMC would ring her back.\nShe gave a phone number which\nwould not accept incoming calls.\nGuilds then rang Chelsea,\npretending to be QMC, saying\nthat if QMC phoned to ask about\na rag stunt at IC, it would really\nbe Imperial trying to gather\ninformation to enable them to\nblock the raid, and therefore they\nshould be told nothing.\nAbout 25 QMC students met a Guilds contingent in South\nKensington. Guilds, now\npretending to be from Chelsea,\nlured QMC to Beit Quad.\nThe Joint party stormed into\nthe Quad and did not notice that\nthe gates were locked behind\nthem.\nThey ran towards the Union\nOffice and were taken into one of\nthe rooms which was meant to\ntrap them. It was here that the\ntrue identity of the 'Chelsea'\nstudents was revealed and the\nsquad were joined by about 30\nother Imperial students for a flan, water and flour fight in Beit\nQuad.\nThis included participants\nbeing sprayed with water from\nhose pipes located on the roof of\nBeit Hall. Mrs Jen Hardy-Smith,\nUnion Clerk, also joined in the\nattack by throwing jug-fulls of\nwater out of the Union Office\nwindow, allegedly shouting\n'Come on duck ies, let's get the\nr otters!'. The original plan was to\nkidnap a QMC student, when the\nrest of the QMC team found the\ngates locked, they threatened\nviolence and were later allowed\nto leave covered in treacle, foam,\nwater and contents of dustbins.\nNo permanent damage was\ndone to Beit Quad and no one\nwas injured. The whole area was\nlater sprayed down with hose-pipes.\nCollege Security Officer,\nGeoffrey Reeves, who accidently\nwalked in on the raid treated the\nwhole incident very lightheartedly and described it as just\na bit of fun. He said that 'this is\nwhat you expect when you steal\nsomeone's mascot'.\n\u2022The minibus, that was last week\nimmobilized by QMC, was\nrecovered using spare wheels.\nThe original wheels and some\nrugby kits have not been returned\nand the police have been\ninformed and are investigating\nthe matter. Mary, the QMC\nmascot, is still in the possess sion of RCSU and its return will not\n\u2022 be considered until the return of\nthe wheels.\nThe Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nCentenary week\nra success'\n'Centenary Week went\ntremendously and was a complete success', according to\nProfessor Sayers, Dean of the\nCity and Guilds College. He also\nsaid that he would look\nsympathetically on the loss\nincurred by the City and Guilds\nUnion following the Masquerade\nBall. This poorly attended event\nlost at least \u00a3500. Professor\nSayers said that he was pleased at\nthe enthusiasm shown by some\nstudents to act as part of the team\nshowing visitors around College.\nThe symposium and exhibition\nhad together impressed industry\nand the University Grants\nCommittee had portrayed the\nCollege as an elite institution.\nFrom a financial viewpoint the\nCollege has profited as several\nmajor research contracts are\nbeing discussed as a result of Tech\n2000 and it is thought that the\ncontract return will pay for the\ncost of setting up the exhibition.\nDuring the open days over\n2000 school children visited the\nC&G departments and Tech\n2000.\nThe symposium, held last\nWednesday attracted about 200\nguests and 250 staff and students.\nThe presentations are to be\nturned into a book together with\nsome specially commissioned\nchapters on '21st Century\nTechnology'. It is expected to be\npublished later on this year.\nA QMC man, left, gets his just deserts-in the face.\nFree! Friday 8 March 1985 No 699\n\n"

    "content": "SINGLES\n45\nRamones: Chasing The Night\nA couple of weeks after the\nrelease of Howling At The\nMoon, the 12 inch single has\ninstead fronted with Chasing\nThe Night. A much more\nrocky ditty than the Dave\nStewart production. I prefer it.\nThe question now is will they\nchange the 7 inch?\nGo West: We Close Our Eyes\nSounds just like Paul Young\nbut it ain't him. Has Howard\nJones synths but it ain't him\neither. Derivative certainly but\nit's still a good song. Pop rock\nis probably the best way to\ndescribe it. Oh, one thing\u2014don't get the picture\ndisc like I did\u2014the quality is\nwell na ff. Limbo: Putting on The Ritz\nA 'AA' release with ManNited, the Mike Harding football song piss take, but\nthis remake of the Irving\nBerlin Classic is definitely my\nfavourite. Limbo area Huddersfield vocal harmony\nband, but instead of pon c ing around like the Flying Pickets,\nthis band heads for a blend of\nSkiffle and Barbershop. It's good.\nBilly Bragg: Between The\nWars\nI heard this on Saturday\nLive and dashed out to buy the\nalbum, only to find it wasn't on\nit. Now a single release I 'll\ndash out to buy that instead. A mournfully simple folk song\nsung with acoustic guitar, I have seldom been moved so\nmuch by the words of a song.\nWith three other tracks thrown\nin for only \u00a31.25 it is excellent\nvalue.\nPumb Blenders: Love Boat\nAwful American disco rubbish.\nDavid Cassidy: The Last Kiss\nI always hated this guy.\nWhen I was about five, all the\ngirls I fancied were n't interested (nothing chan ges!). Time goes on and now I find I can enjoy his music\nwhile all those contemporary\nfemales put him down as a has-been. Sounds very 70's. He even sounds like David\nSoul( remember Silver\nLady?). An OK song though.\nBoring, but OK.\nCINEMA\nLovers'\nLives\nFrom a personal point of view,\nI am beginning to find\nromance very tiresome, especially that of other\npeople. Prying into lover's lives is like sleeping in their\nsheets, and to have them\nthrust in your face at half past\nten in the morning does little\nfor me or my temper.\nDance with a Stranger is the\ntragic tale of ordinary lovers;\nand tragically ordinary it is\ntoo. Ruth Ellis, a London tart,\nCINEMA\nCarmen\nHot on the heels of Carlos\nSaura and Peter Brooks,\nFrancesco Rosi presents his\nversion of the opera.\nRosi realises here the hope\nof opera to achieve transcendence with sound and\nimage. Yet Rosi does this\nwithin the frame-work of\ncinema, he reconciles the\ntheatricality that is opera with\nthe scope and intimacy that is\nin the grasp of cinema. Mind,\nCarmen is possibly the easiest\nopera, at least with respect to\nits dynamics, to adapt for\ncinema, as Rosi admitted\nlived with her protege Desmond Cussen for ten\nyears. He loved her. She loved\nDavid Blakely, a young but\ndepressive racing driver, with\na flare for losing. She became\npregnant; he left her. Torn by\njealousy and under intense\npressure, Ruth Ellis shot him\nfive times, leaving none for\nherself. She was hung three\nmonths later, (the last woman\never in this country) and\nearned the name 'Breakneck'.\nThe film is dedicated to\nauthenticity. It could be\nsensationalist, but it isn't. The\nbackground of each character\nis investigated in considerable\ndetail and is well balanced\n(the East End stage product-ion last year severely neglected the emotional and\ndepressive make-up of both\nwhen i spoke to him in\nNovember. (Thats the best\npose I 've managed to date).\nThe film provides near\nperfection in nearly every\nrespect. The photograph is a towering achievement. Shooting on location in the\ncraggy mountains and sun-baked small towns of Spain,\nPasqualino De Santis instills a sensation of space and depth\nwhich creates a realism that\nalmost negates the theatricality. We observe Rosi's mastery\nof the medium in the opening\nscene. Here we witness the\nforeplay and death of a bull in\nthe ring. The scene is\nmes m eric. Even as the bull\nlowers his head to accept the\naccurate blade of Escamillo\n(the Matador) he demands\nfrom you a respect and\nrec gni tion of his dignity and\nZREVIEWSJ\nmen in the triangle), but well\ndocumented as it is, the film,\ndrags on, without any build up\nof suspense or release from\nthe claustrophobic viewpoints\nof the three characters.\nSadly , the film has done\nlittle for the actors either.\nMiranda Richardson has\nworked extremely hard in\nunderstanding Ellis' character\nwith only little experience in\nTV work, this major break may\nwork against her in the public\neye. In contrast, Rupert\nEverett suffers from being\ntypecast as a petulant romantic. The parallels between this and his role in\nAnother country are strong,\nand, as an increasingly popular actor, he must be sure his fame is based upon\nversatility and not fashion.\nhow it sickens to see such a one; a. perfect conception,\nbrought to his knees, made\nlifeless, a mass of still flesh.\nRosi gives you a real death.\nThe bull is not the only one\nto give a fine (if farewell)\nperformance. Julia MigenesJohnson's intuitive Carmen\n] has to be the most sensual and\n;fiery gypsy on Celluloid.! Johnson not quite matched by\nPlacido Domingo who produces something of a stiff\nDon Jose. Small criticism.\nWhat of the music? Well,\nRosi co-ordinates such an\nintricate bonding between\nBizet's music and De Santis'\nphotography, one moment\nBizet provides the score then\nat another the nara ti ve, some\nlater the score again. Quite\nbrilliant.\nFrancesco Rosi has created\nsomething of a masterpiece.\nFELIX Friday 8 March 1985 13\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS!\nOBITUARY\nIan Munro\nProfessor John Munro\nJohn Munro died suddenly on\nWednesday 27 February, aged\n56. He was Professor of Civil\nEngineering Systems and had\nbeen Head of the Civil\nEngineering Department since\n1982. His premature death comes\nas a bitter blow to all those who\nknew him, were taught by him or\nwho worked with him. Ian\u2014he\nwas known to us all as Ian, not\nJohn\u2014was a source of\ninspiration whose presence will\nbe sorely missed. Above all, he\nwas a truly kind and fair man; no\nproblem was too small or too\nlarge for him; Ian's door was ever\nopen.\nIan came to the Civil\nEngineering Department in 1955\nfrom Ove Arup and Partners to\nundertake the Concrete\npostgraduate course. This was\nfollowed by research on\ncylindrical shell structures and\nthen appointment as Lecturer in\n1957, Senior Lecturer in 1967,\nReader in Civil Engineering\nSystems in 1974 and Professor in\n1980. Ian's teaching and research\nactivities were wide-ranging and\nenthusiastically pursued\nthroughout his life. Whilst most\nresearchers are content to apply\nthemselves to a single main topic\nof research, Ian's considerable\ntalents enriched three distinct\nareas: shell structures, frame\nstructures and civil engineering\nsy tem s. His research displayed an\nuncommon elegance, starting\nfrom his use of the Goldenveizer\nStatic-Kinematic Analogy in\nshell structures and leading\nultimately to the principle of\nGUILDS\nELECTION COLLECTION\nTOMORROW\nSAT 9 MARCH\n24HR COLLECTION FOR\nROYAL MARSDEN HOSPITAL\nTURN UP AT GUILDS OFFICE\n8.00 TO 10.00PM TONIGHT\nOR THROUGH THE DAY\nTOMORROW\n(OPEN TO ALL CCU'S) Static-Kinematic Duality in\nstructural mechanics. This in\nturn was explored via\nmathematical programming\nwhere once again Duality theory\ngave expression to existing and\nnew structural theorems.\nIn the 1960's Ian also became\ninterested in areas apparently\nremote from civil engineering\u2014\nClaude Shannon's Theory of\nCommunication and Statistical\nEntropy, Statistical Decision\nAnalysis and Zadeh's Fuzzy Set\nTheory. (He also gave a course\non computing before the College\nor University had any digital\ncomputers!). From this stemmed\nhis interest in Systems\nEngineering and in 1971 the\nSystems and Mechanics Section\nwas established under his\nhead ship. Quick to identify completely\nnew and fruitful areas of civil\nengineering research he had\nencouraged the use of Expert\nSystems and logic programming\nwithin the Department.

    "content": "PRESIDENT Carl Burgess proposed by Greg Simpson\nHow can I sum up why Carl should be President in\nabout 100 words.\nHe has shown his ability, to take on any job and\ndo it excellently, as Rag Chairman and Rag Mag\nEditor he has re vitali sed Rag and will do the same\nfor ICU as President. He has done a lot for IC,\nedited the RCS Handbook, was one of the\nfounders of IC Wing Chun Club, represented\nI.C.U. at U.L. U. and college committees and has\nbeen the I.C. observer at the NUS conference\nBut having said that he still exhibits the\ncharacteristics of the average student.\nGreg Simpson\nThe job of President needs not only experience in\nsitting on committees but experience in dealing\nwith people, both College Admin and students, on\na personal basis. Sitting on high powered\ncommittees such as Governing Body and Finance\nand Executive needs exact knowledge of the\nstudents' case because the President will be facing\nexperienced negotiators. A strong President who\nwill not be intimidated by such people is needed to\nput forward the students' case.\nI believe that many students do not get involved\nin the Union because there is a gross lack of\ncommunication between the Union and the\ngeneral student body. Consequently many\ndecisions are made by a small body self-interested\nparties behind closed doors. The excuse given is\nthat if anybody wanted to find out, the information\nis freely available. I believe that students should be\ntold what is happening about all matters before key\ndecisions are made which affect them, in order for\ntheir views to be heard.\nCarl Burgess\nPRESIDENT Gareth Pritchard proposed by Andrew Palmer\nAs you are highly unlikely to know, I am standing\nfor the sabbatical post of President. This is one of\nthe major problems of our Union\u2014a total lack of\ninterest or participation in the Union, and\nsomething I pledge myself to change.\nThis apathy is one of the most disturbing\naspects of ICU, and places us in a bad position\nwhen making representations to college. On this\nfront, the recent unseemly infighting between the\nCCU's on the one hand and the major subcommittees and Union hierarchy on the other has\nonly weakened our case on such occasions. To\nthis problem I will bring what might seem a strange\nadvantage. Some might call it inexperience, but it\nshould really be seen as impartiality between the\nCCU's and the MSC's.I regard the current split as\ntotally wrong for our Union\u2014it should be a place\nfor relaxation not recrimination.\nAs an indication of my attitudes towards the\nissues involved, I support the concept of a financial\ncarry-over for all Union sub-units, as this\nencourages fiscal economy. I also favour the\ncurrent type of autonomy enjoyed by CCU's, but\nthey must realise that this is not something they\nshould abuse\u2014it is in their interests as well that the\nUnion should run smoothly.\n1 would also adopt a pragmatic approach to\nUnion involvement in the wider political sphere. As\na result of this, and of the need for financial\nstringency, 1 am strongly opposed to NUS\nmembership\nFinally, I would say to anyone reading this that\nthis election concerns you. I would rather you\nvoted for me, but want you most of all simply to\nvote. Apathy will be the bane of this Union, college\n(and indeed country).\nGJ Pritchard\nChem 3\nGraham Thorpe proposed by Chris Hendy\nThe proposer\nI 've seen six presidential elections at Imperial.\nThose candidates making extravagant promises\nfailed to produce results. Graham Thorpe makes\nno such claims. He has the confidence, respect\nand experience to lead the Union during a difficult\n1985/6. Please read his manifesto and I'm sure you\nwill make the sensible decision to VOTE\nTHORPE.\nChris Hendy\nThe experience\n1st year council rep.\nMetallurgy Department Rep 82/3\nICU Academic Affairs Officer 83/4\nRSM Open Day Chairman 83/4\nUGC Visitation Group Member\nThe candidate\nPeople have asked me in the past few weeks what I am going to do when running the Union. I could\nhave given them a load of crap, but I asked the\nPRESIDENT\nRSM Friend\u00a7 of China Society\nRSM Anti-Apartheid Committee\nRSM Wist\nRSM Hon-Porns Committee\nOrigami Soc (before it folded up)\nTreasurer of the Real Ale Society\nPresident of the T Total Club\nThe main problem is the financing of IC Union. I said the other day to Graham Thorpe, \"The\nCollege is expecting a cut in funding of 1-1.5% in\nreal terms.\" To alleviate this problem, since the\nRector is leaving, I plan to convert 170 Queensgate\ninto 25 Student Flats. This will provide income and\nquestion in return, \"What does the Union mean to\nyou?\" Of course I have plenty of ideas that I want\nto implement, but contrary to popular rumour, the\nUnion isn't run by just three men all the time.\nThere is a vital need for feedback which at present\nis sadly lacking.\nWhen voting for all the posts this year I ask you\nto consider exactly what the Union means to you.\nHow about:- the chance to play sport and the\npresent poor level of facilities; the probability of\ngetting good, cheap residence in your second and\nthird years; the fight for effective lecturer training;\nthe staging of gigs and discos, as well as operas and\nplays; the chance to go mountaineering, or diving,\nor become a DJ; whether your fees money goes on\nteaching you or on research; the standard of food\nin refectories; the price of books and beer.\nOpen your eyes to ALL the Union activities\nwhether I 've listed them or not. Come Monday and\nTuesday, use your vote, and for your sake use it\nwisely.\nGraham Thorpe\nAllan Trench proposed by Sarah Cox\nhelp to solve the accommodation problem.\nTo solve the refectory problem, I shall install a kebab and curry house into the union.\nI cannot foresee any problems as far as grants\nare concerned because Sir Keith Joseph is my\nUncle, and I shall be applying family pressure.\nI take the view that whilst cutting back spending\non education may lead to short term benefit the\nlong term effects of such a course of action will be\nharmful at a period of rapid technological growth if\neconomic development is to be sustained. As\nCaligula said, \"Would that the Roman people had\nbut one neck\".\nI shall direct the affair of the Union and coordinate representation of the union's viewpoint to\nthe college and to other authorities. Most of you\nwill agree that higher education is more than\nacademic work for a degree\u2014it is also about\nhobbies and pastimes, sports and social ising, meeting people and exchanging views and ideas.\nAfter all, as Bernard Shaw said, \"A university life\nwithout pleasure is no education at all.\"\nIt will not be a. pleasant task to sort out IC Union.\nTo quote from Hamlet, \"I must be cruel only to be\nkind\".\nI am the man for the job. As Aristotle said, \"Allan\nTrench is by nature a political animal\".\nAllan Trench\n8 Friday 8 March 1985 FELIX\n\n"
