    "content": "PRESIDENT'S REPORT\nSick Bay. The health service is under considerable pressure to reduce costs( like the whole College) and the area most threatened is the sick bay. The proposal is to charge first year residents a compulsory insurance premium( about \u00a310) on their first hall bill. This will entitle individuals to free sick bay treatment for3 years. First years not in hall will be able to join voluntarily. A system will be worked out for second and third years. I was initially against a compulsory insurance but have changed my mind since it is that or no sick bay. I propose we accept the idea in principle. Residence \u2022\nThe idea of paying rent over the vacation as discussed at the last UGM has been shelved. I will present verbally the outcome of discussions at Student Residence Committee on domestic services in the halls. Redundancies. The Rector presented a plan at last week's Governing Body for redundancies, again emphasizing that they may not be necessary in the near future. The College branch of the AUT have ideas for raising or saving money to prevent redundancies. Some of these ideas directly affect students so I sent my comments in writing to Governing Body. I was\nnot present at the meeting so perhaps Barney can report on the outcome. Chancellor's Glass. I attended a reception for the Chancellor, HRH Princess Anne, at ULU and cleverly obtained the very glass from which she was drinking,( Coke!).1 hope the Rag Chairman will be able to raffle this magnificent trophy at this meeting.

Hunter, D. Poley, P. Lindetend, all of ME3. Sir\nIam writing to you today\nin disapproval of the criticism\nmy College is receiving from\nthe anti-apartheid movement\nfor allowing South African\nmining companies access to\nBritish students for recruitment overseas. It is well known that Great Britain relies heavily upon South Africa' for important raw materials. The British mining\nindustry( notably at the Royal School of Mines) also\nrelies upon the South Africans\nfor their wealth of technical\nexpertise. In the mining of\nminerals, a reason that sends\nmany of our students abroad\nevery summer for vacation\ntraining. Whilst one accepts\nthat the subjugation of a people based upon colour, is\nboth cruel and humiliating,\none must realise that this is a problem born of many years,\nand not one having a fast and\nstable political solution. Faced with the possible erosion of our own infra st ruc ture, I feel that Britain, as a nation, is in no position to\nturn her back on South Africa\nand that members of anti-apartheid should consider\nmore carefully the possible'\nimplications of their actions.\nThe position for \" laissez faire\" has already been stated\nin a letter written to you by\nMr D. Ashforth, a letter that\nleft MrE. M.Ungo a la( a physics PC) in a state of\nshuddering, mind-boggling,\nutter confusion!

Such a system would\nclearly be effective lor hothouse or market garden crops,\nbut its application to cereals\nmay be more difficult, because\nof the way these arc planted.\nIn the current economic:\nclimate there is likely to be\nsuitable numbers of workers\navailable, already being paid\nby the Government. The use\nof this, as yet, untapped workforce would therefore kill\ntwo birds( unemployment and pollution from pesticides)\nwith one stone. The profits\ncoming from increased crop\nprotection (and irrigation...if\nthis is needed), and the money\nsaved on pesticides could be\nused to increase the standard\nof living of the workforce. The quality of life would also be\nincreased by considerable decentralisation of the population (reducing pressure on\ndecaying inner city areas)\nand increasing the health of\nthe population as a result of\nexercise and more natural food in the diet.\nWe are starting a pilot\nscheme on our windowsill,\nand I suggest that this is a line\nof logistic research which the\ngovernment would do well to\nfollow up.\nl ours sincerely\nJohn Hollier\nZoo 3\nDear Sir\nWe were very disappointed\nby the illustration in the\nbottom corner of the spring\nterm FELIX calendar\u2014why\nwasn't it male!!!

    "content": "Ika and Noah, the stars of the forthcoming recreation of prehistoric life \"Quest for Fire\".\n*74ea0t eOn The Rattle by Tom Stoppard.\nAdopted from Johann Nestroy and\ndirected by Peter Wood. The Lyttelton,\nNational Theatre.\nIf you think you have problems in communicating and that people misunderstand\nwhat you say then you ought to see Tom Stoppard'sOn The Razzle at the National.\nYour problems are nothing in comparison to\nJthose of the characters in the play. Line after\nline of dialogue abounds with comic confusion\nand misunderstanding, but these verbal tribulations are only a part of the troubles\nbeset by the characters.\nA grocer's assistant and young apprentice,\nplayed respectively by Ray Brooks and Felicity\nKendal, escape for a day and a night on the\ntwo in Vienna. But they get much more than\nthey bargained for. The amorous adventures\nof their boss, Zangler, also bring him to\nVienna. Played hilariously by Dinsdale Landen,\nZangler is a rotund, red-faced, irrepressible\nman, with a modest possession of hair\nridiculously over creamed. He suffers tragically from word mixing. The chaos that\nhits Vienna and the fast-moving comedy that\nensues reminds one of the lunatic antics of the\nMarx Brothers.\nStoppard'sOn The Razzle is at least the\nfourth reworking of Johann Nestroy's play\nEinen Jux-will er sich mach en( He's out for a Fling), which Nestroy himself pinched from\nsomeone else. (Now there's originality for\nyou!). Nest roy was the king of Viennese comedy in the last century and usually performed in his own plays. He was also an\nopera singer until the age of thirty. What\nNestroy added to Viennese comedy in his time\nwas satire. The programme notes proclaim\nthat \" he looked at the human race, and\ndecided that the treatment it needed was\nmockery.\" Nestroy wrote \"I believe the worst\nof any human being, even of myself, and I have\nseldom been mistaken.\" His style wasn't political satire, but satire on human nature\nitself.\nThe original play on which On The Razzle is\nbased is a play of its day. It is full of topical\nreferences. It also plays games with the\nViennese dialect giving rise to a language full of\nsubtleties, cleverly mastered to evade the\npowerful censorship that existed in that day.\nStoppard necessarily had to 'start afresh' in\norder to make the play intelligible, ano\nhumorous, to modern day English audiences.\nThe play's comedy rests virtually entirely on\nthe play of words. Consequently it your\nEnglish is not good, like the French couple\nnext tome, you remain poker faced throughout the whole play. It is not my type of\nhumour, but it was noticeable that it was the\nolder members of the audience who were in a near-permanent state of laughter. (Tis a funny\nthing humour.)\nNick Bedding\nMean by J.P. Sartre, was presented by\nImperial College Dramatic Society.\nKean relates the tale of the Victorian actor\nof the same name who realises himself and as a consequence, which the story attempts to\nnecessitate, has to leave the profession in\nwhich he is so lucid. The concept of acting, the\nwhole business of plays and the theatre, is an\nobvious one on which Sartre could impose his\nCartesian melodrama. The play delights in\nillustrations of games-playing, of inflated\nartificiality as simulated as real from Ke an playing Hamlet to Kean playing at being Kean\nin London's rigid social life.\nThe presentation was formal but efficient,\nwith any doubts about the multiple points of\nthe play being lost in unnecessary styli s ation being dispelled as the main characters gained\nstrength. It could be said that some of the\nexistential pivots of the story, so dear to\nSartre, were sometimes a little underplayed\nwhile other facets, such as the gay hairdresser,\nwere needlessly overstated. However, much of\nthe rougher humour of the play and amusing\nsubsidiary characters served to sustain the\nplays length which, at around three hours, the\ncast coped with very well. Some lively\ntechniques, such as planted members of the\naudience pelting Kean with fruit, brought the\nplay off the stage and beyond strict formality\nwithout any danger to the coherence of the\nstory as a whole.\nThe plot itself begins to flag in the final\nscenes with Sartre' s labour ing on choice\nthreatening to dissolve into sentimentality but\nthe cast met with this graciously and altogether gave a good, enthusiastic performance.\nIt is perhaps a pity that after the people\ninvolved had obviously put in a lot of work to\nput on a generally slick performance of Kean\nthat when I was there, Saturday night, the hall\nwas only half-full.\nDavid Gill\nQuest for Fire, 20th Century Fox,\nDirected by Jean-Jacques Annaud.\nQuest for Fire would claim to portray the\nfirst romance in history, but the happy event is\nnot reached until a great deal of sex (usually\nanal) and violence has taken place.\nThe film is set 80,000BC when tribes have\ndiscovered the advantages of fire but cannot\ncreate it anew. This means they must keep a continually burning flame and fight other tribes\nwhen their own flame is/has extinguished.\nThese fights are extremely violent, not\nsurprising as members of the same tribe can\nnot really communicate, never mind two\nopposing tribes realising that they can share\nthe same source of fire.\nIt is in this context that a relationship\ndevelope s between Naoh (Everett McGill) and\nIka (Rae Dawn Chong) from a more advanced\ntribe who eventually shows Naoh and his tribe\nhow to make fire for themselves.\nThe couple meet when Naoh and two of his\ntribesmen set out in search of fire and the\nmajority of the film consists of their encounters\nwith other tribes, mammoths (really elephants)\nand sabre-tooth tigers. Although these scenes\nare exciting and occasionally funny, at times it\nis hard to believe a man could walk from the\nArctic to East Africa within a few feet of film.\nThe film was made on a large budget and will\nappeal more to those interested in action and\nadventure than those who want a study in\ninterpersonal relationships. It features only\ntwo ' big' names( Anthony Burgess who invented the special language used and Desmond Morris who created the body\nlanguage) neither of whom is usually associated with the film industry. The film is\ncurrently enjoying enormous success in\nAmerica. Peter Rodgers\nWhose Life is it Anyway? (A) John\nBadham, 1981. Starring Richard Dreyfuss,\nChristine Lahti. 119 mins. Showing: ABC\nFulham Road, ABC Bayswater, Classic\nOxford Street.\nThis started as a Granada TV play, was then\nput on by the Greenwich Fringe, transferred to\nthe West End, on to Broadway, and now \"see\nthe film\".\nThe action has been transposed to America,\nbut I presume the original view was supposed\nto survive. It doesn't. Any meaningful illustration of ethic and all tension generated\nby choice is firmly buried beneath the artificial\nedifice of sachar r in sentimentality.\nOriginally the paralysed Ken Harrison was a bluff sculptor but in this version, and played by\nRichard Dreyfuss, he can sketch like Renoir\nand sculpt like Rodin. He has a beautiful ballet\ndancer girlfriend, who is treated as a trinket\nthroughout the film, and he is fawned over by\nan equally attractive and bauble-like lady\ndoctor. From the wonderfully talented surgeon\nto the street-wise hospital orderly, caricatures\npropagate increasingly pointlessly in this\nwilderness. Each character in serving merely\nas a testimony to Ken's wonderful ness becomes an automated void and instead of\ndefining the nature and limits of the choices\nopen to him they create a hollowness that\nswallows plot and any ensuing moral decision.\nIf you like films sugary, safe and an aes thetis ed, singularly devoid of any questioning of\nethic, then you may be able to stand this one. I think it should have been aborted.\nDavid Gill\nPage 6 FELIX, March 26, 1982\n\n"

The lucky applicants will be\nexpected to spend their three month summer vacation under the employ\nof NASA. The work will involve spending three weeks in each of four\ndepartments under the supervision of a well-known space-scientist. To gain an understanding of the workings of the Space Shuttle, while at the\nsame time undergoing the initial training given to prospective astronauts.\nGiven sufficient progress, the students can expect to be flying the Space\nShuttle simulator by the end of the summer and may even be allowed a co-pilot's seat in the Enterprise during her test-flights, from the back of a Jumbo over the Arizona desert.\nThis promises to be a very intensive course with little opportunity for a social life, however it is clearly the chance of a lifetime. The aim behind\nthe scheme is, to quote the ESA letter \"to give European science\nstudents an insight into the workings of NASA, with particular view to\nencouraging them to join the Space Lab team, once they graduate from\nuniversity.\" We would like to emphasize that the successful applicants\nshould expect to work hard and be able to get on well with the other\nstudents from Germany, France and Italy who will also be on the same\nscheme. Physical fitness is obviously a must.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nGAME OVER FOR PINBALL WIZARD.\nMr Barney McCabe has resigned from his position as ICU Deputy\nPresident following a motion of no confidence at last Monday's ICU Council meeting.\nThe start of the meeting was delayed by over twenty minutes as\nthere were not enough Council members present to form a quorum.\nUnder the Deputy President's business there was an extensive\ndiscussion about the pinball and video machines in the Union Lower\nLounge. Last year the Union earned considerable revenue from these\nmachines but so far this session they have lost ,\u00a32,000. The DP was\ncriticised for his handling of the situation; in particular, that he did not\nrealise the seriousness of the problem and take action earlier.\nMr Philip Nathan, Life Sciences Dep Rep, then proposed a motion\nof no confidence in the DP. In his proposal speech he outlined how he\nconsidered that Barney had not done his job in a satisfactory manner.\nAn amendment to the motion (proposed by Chris Webb) to further\ninstruct the Chairman of Council (Nick Morton) to take the motion of\nno confidence to the next U GM was accepted.\nPhil Greenstreet (DP-elect) then spoke against the motion. He\npointed out areas where he thought the DP had achieved something,\nbut on a secret vote the motion of no confidence was carried. The\nvoting was 14 for; 7 against; and. 2 abstentions.\nAfter the result had been announced, Mr McCabe concluded his\nreport b v tendering his resignation and leaving the meeting. He also\nhanded Marco Led wold a letter confirming that his resignation would\ntake effect from Friday. April2. At this point Council became in quo rate and the meeting was closed.\nThere was, however, some discussion over whether the motion of no\nconfidence should be taken to the U GM. Eventually Chris Webb agreed to speak to such a motion instead of Nick Morton. After the meeting Barney stated that he had not resigned from his\npost as Editor of The Phoenix and intended to continue production of\nthe magazine.\nRock on Tommy It was not until early last week that the loss of money from the games\nmachine was noticed. After Mr Nick Morton, ICU President, requested an estimate for next\nyear's income from games machines it was discovered that\nexpenditure on rental exceeded\nincome by approx ^2,000.\nThe reasons for the situation\nare not clear; a series of thefts\nover the summer and a fall-off in\nuse age may account for some\nloss, but it was estimated that\nover ,\u00a32,000 profit should have\nbeen made by the end of this\nyear. It was suggested at ICU Council that the Deputy President should have noticed the loss\nearlier and taken appropriate\naction.\nMascots Returned\nA crowd of over fifty people gathered in Beit Quadrangle on\nWednesday lunchtime to witness the return of Spanner and Bolt.\nThe violated mascot of City and Guilds Union had been in the\npossession of the Royal College of Science Union since February 4 and\nwere originally to be returned last Thursday.\nCity and Guilds Union had performed a series of tasks in order to\nsecure the return of the mascots. These included sending Valentine's to\nthe R CSU Executive, cleaning shoes, selling pancakes and even\naccompanying R CSU mascot ry on a raid to Kings College. Besides\nthis, C& GU President Andy Rushton raised money by a sponsored\nalcohol-free period and other members of Guilds knitted a scarf.\nThe total raised for R CSU Rag is believed to be in excess ol \u00a3330.\n\"No 611 Friday, March26,1982 Free!

Two days and three nights later the Chem1 team\nreached zero with a double seven, followed closely by the Chem2 team\nwho took 89 shots to finish from double three.\nEach team threw between seventy and eighty thousand darts (the\nexact figures to be revealed soon) weighing a total of around two tons,\nat an average of roughly thirteen points per dart.\nThe players were hindered by armies of cockroaches which invaded\nthe Lower Lounge at three o 'clock each morning and by the cleaners\nwho, with only a few thousand points to go, attempted to eject\neveryone on Monday. It is expected that a three figure sum has been raised for RCS Rag.\nWaldegrave at IC\nThe conservative MP William Waldegrave spoke at College last\nTuesday on the invitation of the\nConservative Society.\nMr W alder grave is undersecretary of state for h iger education and told the small crowd how universities had been\nreceiving larger and larger amounts of their money from the\nUniversity Grants Committee. In\nthe past they had received the\nmajority of their income from\nother sources, but now 95% of\ntheir money comes from the\nUGC. Mr Waldergrave said the\ngovernment would like to see this\nfigure reduced to about 85%.\nElection Results\nThe Royal School of Mines Union ratified its executive for next year at\ntheir U GM last Tuesday. The candidate for Honorary Secretary was\nthe only one unopposed. The officers are: President Nigel Walls: Vice President John Eagleson; Hon Sec Mark Daniel.\nThe elections for departmental representatives were also held this\nweek. Nine new representatives were elected to be ratified at today'sU GM. There were no candidates for the post in Ci vEng and the Chem Eng election will have to be re-run because there was no-one to man\nthe ballot-box in the afternoon. Those elected are: Chemistry G.O 'Shea; Computing P. Donovan; Elec Eng G. Bowser (re-elected):\nGeology M. Jones; Life Sci P. Burt; Maths F. Whitelaw; Me chEng R. Tang; Met& Mat Sci C. Southall; Physics D. Parry. The elections in\nAero Eng and Mineral Resources Eng have still to be held.\nSextet Stun\nSouthside\nLast Saturday was marked by the\nfirst appearance of a Life Sciences Review in the Southside\nReal Ale Bar.\nThe review, organised by Mr Philip Nathan( the Divisional\nRepresentative), consisted of a series of songs and sketches as\nwell as awards for various achievements within the depart-ment s. These consisted of foam\npies and succeeded in clearing\nmost of the audience back into\nthe adjoining bar.\nThe highlight of the evening\nwas undoubtedly the performance of a sextet of dancers lead\nby Miss Christine Starch of Life\nSci2. They performed a remarkably intimate arrangement\nwhich went down very well with\nthe audience. The Editor of\nFELIX commented that he\nwould investigate this story in\ngreater depth at a later date.\nAnother\ncock-up\nThe inefficiencies of the Bookings\nOffice were highlighted again\nthis week when Wellsoc tried to\nhold their Annual General Meeting in the Mines Building\nlast Tuesday. Well so chad confirmed their booking of the\nSutton Lecture Theatre twice\nbut on the night the security\nguard claimed that he hadn't been informed of the booking. It\nwas only after Mr R. Dickens,\nthe Security Superintendent, was\ncontacted that the meeting was\nallowed to go ahead, but only\nafter a crowd of people had been\nkept waiting.\nChairman of Well soc Mr Pallab Ghosh later said \" It isn't the first time this has happened,\nthis sort of cock-up happens on a regular basis. It happened to us\nbefore this term when we'd booked Me chEng220 and had\nto turn seventy members away.\"\nA secretary from the Bookings\nOffice said the appropriate paper\nwork was sent to security every\nweek and if security didn't read\nit, it wasn't the Booking Office's fault.\nMr Nick Morton is currently\ntaking the matter up with Captain Lindley, the College Domestic Secretary.\nCult Corner\nAt Nightline we occasionally receive calls from people who have friends\nor relatives involved with cult groups. Sometimes the callers only want a few details about the cult while other times they are trying to find\nsomeone and release them from the cult.\nOrganisations which sometimes crop up in calls include the Unification\nChurch (Moonies), Krishna Consciousness, Scientology and recently\nExegesis and the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh cult. The last two have\nrecently been receiving some attention in the national press.\nPeople are well informed about the Moonies and further comment is\nnot necessary. Exegesis is not a religious cult but more of a psychotherapy group. The techniques used are long aggressive\nencounter sessions which can be quite damaging to peoples personalities\nand even affect mental stability. The wallet is also damaged\u2014at around\n\u00a3150 for a training course!\nThe Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh cult is growing rapidly. It bears the name\nof the founder, who saw the light in 1953. He spent the next thirteen\nyears teaching and developing his faith in India. In 1969 he started a therapy centre in Bombay and the first non-Indians were admitted a year\nlater. During the seventies the cult spread to the West and now has\nsixteen centres and 2,000 disciples in the UK alone.\nDisciples are given a new name when they join. They have to wear\norange and red clothes (fully or partially), a picture of their master and\n108 sandalwood beads. The cult also moves it disciples between centres\nand countries. People who attend the newcomers evenings at the Chalk\nFarm Centre (cost 50p) are rarely aware of the power in the meditation\ntechniques. More advanced members indulge in induced hysteria\nsessions as well as relaxation, dancing and controlled breathing\nexercises. Free sexual expression is also important in the therapy.\nLike the Moonies, people do get lost in this organisation. The therapy,\nespecially if insulated from outside influences, can lead to 'brainwashing'\n(perhaps a function of personaly strength?). The dangers are two-fold.\nFirst is the upheaval caused to family and friends when a disciple rejects\nthem or disappears. Secondly is the psychological damaged suffered by\nthe disciple when the group rejects them. The disciple will be totally\ndependent on the group for emotional and physical support. Rejection\ncoupled with dumping in a strange city (or country) with no money or\npossessions is a good ticket to a psychiatric hospital.\nFor the last decade the Indian government has been reluctant to grant\nvisas to Westerners visiting the cult's headquarters. Recently the cult\nhave spent \u00a33m on a lOOs q mile ranch in Oregon USA and are building an\nentire town as a cult centre. They have also set up a commune in Suffolk\ncomplete with a school for disciples' children.\nOf course, not all fringe religious cult groups are so bad. However, the\nnext time you drop lOp in a Moonie (etc.) collecting tin it might be worth\nconsidering exactly what you are financing.\nFELIX, March 26, 1982 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "RIP DP\nThe premature departure of ICU Deputy\nPresident Barney McCabe was not a complete\nsurprise and it has aroused mixed reactions in\nmost people, not least myself, Nick and\nMarco.\nPutting aside any personal feelings about\nBarney, we must look at the reasons for his\nresignation. The fact is that as Deputy\nPresident he was responsible for the games\nmachines in the Union Lower Lounge and\nshould therefore have known that they were\nlosing money. It was wrong that he did not\ndiscover this earlier and take appropriate\naction to ensure a reasonable profit at the end\nof the year. As a consequence of his error the\nUnion will suffer not only a loss of money but a shortfall of income which will (in the long run)\naffect many clubs and societies.\nFor these reasons it was right that Council\npassed a motion of no-confidence. The fact\nthat Barney chose to resign at this point rather\nthan await aUG M decision was purely his\nchoice. It is by no means certain that he would\nhave been kicked out by aUG M, so I must\ngive him credit for resigning on principle rather\nthan risking further humiliation just to hang on\nto his job.\nIt is also sad to see someone who is widely\nliked having to resign. But overall it was the best\nthing to do.\nScaramouche\nThere were a couple of omissions in this\n\"week's preamble.\nLast week's winner is Linda Burry of Maths\n2 who can collect her cheque on the first\nTuesday of next term.\nThe closing date for entries to the Easter\npuzzles page is 1:00pm, Wednesday, April 28.\nPhoto Competition\nThe winner of last week's competition is\nAndrew Barron of Chemistry who can collect\nhis haircut voucher from the office.

Nillson\nOne of the more active and apparently well-funded dictatorships in the world is Cuba.\nCuba, home of the Havana cigar, the Fidel\nCastro, and Jaffa cakes. Penguins used to be\ngood value, despite a mouthful of feathers.\nBut, ever since it became uneconomical for the\neskimo to manufacture them, Castro's Jaffa\ncakes have become Britain's number one\nimported biscuit, threatening the genuine\narticle.\nThe Ulterior Motive\nQuite simply, old Fungus Chops is out to\nundermine British industry by undercutting its\nprices. Moreover, by flooding the market with\ncheap imitations, Castro is hoping to curry\nfavour with, if not carry flavour to, the British\npublic. He is undoubtedly applying Lenny\nBrezhnev's dictum \"No opportunity must be\nlost in the struggle to overthrow the lackeys of\ncapitalism, to establish the dictatorship of the\nproletariat and to buy me another Western\nsports car\" (Lenny always was shit-hot on\nparadox.)\nThe Manufacturing Process\nTo appreciate the nature of this sinister threat\nto our biscuits, one need only run to ground\nCastro Cakes' distributor in Britian. I caught\nhim furtively fixing a thermostat to a tub of bile\nsecretion (sic). Only when his voice murmured\nthat these were the mixing ingredients being\nkept at a steady temperature did 1 realise the\nunpalatable truth: Castro' s cakes are\nprocessed from shit. So watch out! (Sick.)\nDetecting the Pseud\nIncreasingly, it's difficult to distinguish Castro\ncakes from Jaffa cakes. For one thing, Fidel no\nlonger includes that tell-tale \"hero of the Soviet\nUnion\" medal in each pack. However, if the\ncakes cause severe stomach pains, followed by\nnausea, diarrhoea and acute depression;\nyou've definitely eaten the McVitie's variety.\nWhat You Can Do\nWrite to your MP (IC Union has printed letters\ncalling on Parliament to ban Cuban cakes, and\nwill pay the postage.)*\nBetter still, join the demonstration we've\norganised. Marchers from across the nation,\nunited under the banner 'Pseudosnacks Out\"\nwill be assembling at noon next Thursday at\nSpeaker's Corner in Hyde Park. The proc eec in gs will climax in a rally at 3:00pm in\nTrafalgar Square. Mr Michael Foot (Leader of\nthe Opposition) and Mr Dennis Howell\n(Minister for Droughts, Snow, and OrangeCentred Biscuits) will not be there. But, Bily\nBremner, former Captain of Leeds Utd, will\naddress the meeting through an interpreter.\nThis is not entirely accurate.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince\nConsort Road, London SW7 2BB(5895111 ext 1048 int 2881) Copyright FELIX 1982.
