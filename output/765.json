FELIX, Friday February 27th198711 Rowing\nSaturday 21st Feb.\nBurway Head\nClassic\nengineering\nLast Saturday oarsmen from IC Boat\nclub again snowed their domination\nof rowing in the Home Counties.\nWhile the first eight trained at Putney,\nthe rest of the club raced at Burway\nHead. Of the six categories that they\ncontested the club notched up five\nvictories and one near miss.\nSixty crews competed in the\nmorning's fours racing. Imperial won\nthree divisions. These included the\noverall winners, the Senior B winner\n(second overall) and, most\nspectacularly, the novice winners.\nThe most pleasing result was the\nwin for our novice cox ed four. These\noarsmen began rowing at Imperial on\nOctober 1st and have already reached\na higher standard than oarsmen from\nother clubs who have been rowing for\nyears. The novices raced in an old,\nwell worn boat, and are used to\nequipment failure: last week they lost\nto Brunei University when a seat\nbroke. Victory again seemed to have\nslipped from their hands when the\nrudder fell off. The resourceful cox,\nhowever, was able to steer by dipping\nhis hand into the freezing water. They\ncompleted the race and were delighted\nto beat Brunei and win the novice\ndivision, coming 13th overall.\nThe eights, racing again with a field\nof sixty crews, gained wins for IC at\nSenior A and Senior C levels. The\nSenior A eight (Imperial second\neight), who had raced earlier in fours,\nincluded Chas 'no-nickname'\nBehrens, who had trained in the early\nmorning with the first eight. They\nwon their division easily, but were\nunlucky not to win overall, finishing\na close second to Walton Rowing\nClub.\nThe Senior C crew finished 9th overall and are beginning to gather a ferocious reputation among the other\nclubs. Perhaps this is because of their\ncox, who recently overdosed on ugly\npills.\nBadminton\nMens Doubles\nIC 2, Spartans 7\nDoubles stay\ndown\nIC, having lost 2 vital matches in the\nrace for promotion, came up against\nSpartans, the promotion favourites,\nfor the second and last time this\nseason. It was a match IC had to win.\nThe match started well with first\nblood going to IC's first pair, Simon\nHughes and Sean Mulshaw. They had\na close first game but easily overcame\nSpartans second pair in the second\ngame. Our seconds then had a tough\nstart against the opposition's first pair.\nIt was a hard fought match but Gary\nChapman and Graham Scott, having\nrepeatedly got themselves into\nwinning positions, just could not put\nthe shuttle away. It was the same story\nwhen the 2 Richards, Etheridge and\nLangford, took on the thirds (2\nmembers of the older (illegible-typesetter), one of whom had a lot of\nhair and shouted a lot!!)\nThe second round of matches\nstarted badly when Simon and Sean\nwere beaten by the narrowest of\nmargins by the Spartans first pair. It\nreally could not have been closer, the\nscore being 18-17, 15-18 and 18-17\nagainst IC. It was a shame because\nexactly the same result happened\nwhen these two pairs met earlier in\nthe season. That made the score 3-1\nto Spartans and although Gary and\nGraham had two close rubbers with\nthe opposition it was not going to be\nour night. The score progressed to 5-1\nbefore IC won another rubber but the\nfinal score was 7-2, a result that will\nsurely keep us firmly in the 3rd division.\nQuote of the night by Richard\nLangford\u2014when queried by one of\nthe opposition during play as to\nwhether he had broken a string, he\nreplied, \"No, it's alright it's only\none!\"\nResults since then:\nKensington Inst 4, IC 5\nWhitton 0, IC 9\nOrienteers fail to start\nDue to slight (?) problems with\ntransport on Sunday we didn't make\nit to the proposed event. Fortunately\nwe got 'a lot of exercise on\nSaturday\u2014by showing everybody\nwhere to go! (That is where the\norienteering comes in.) The crosscountry club had invited us to enter\nand marshal Saturday's Hyde Park\nRelays.\nResults: The men's team ran their,\n6x3 mile relay in 107 minutes placing\nthem respectably in the latter half ot\nthe field. The women's team, plagued\nby injury, managed lo come\nsomewhere above las l. running the\n4x2 mile in a total of 70 minutes.\nFinally thanks to all additional\noriente ers who turned up lor three\ncold, but entertaining, hours of\nmarshalling duty.\nFootball\nWednesday 18th Feb.\nIC It's4, SOP 0\nBlizzards and\nturkeys\nOn reaching that remote part of\nEngland known as Turkey Street, the\nIC lads refreshed their parts with half\na pint of local ale and were then ready\nfor an afternoon's business.\nFrom the kick-off these spirited IC\nathletes took control of the game,\nhowever the Siberian blizzards were\nenough to put off the team's decisive\ntouch in front of goal. Hence at halftime the score line remained blank. In\nthe second half Thompson, aided by\nthe slim figure of N MacDonald,\ntenaciously took control in the centre\nof the park once more. The lads\nhaving now become accustomed to\nKeel in's geordie accent, recognised\nhis calls for the ball and duly set him\non his way. creating havoc down the\nright. Indeed it was a fine ball from\nLaverick. putting Keelin through,\nwhose floated cross was met by IC's injured skipper M Barro. which\nstarted the scoring for IC. Minutes\nlater Barrow picked up the ball in\nmidfield. ran tant ali singly at the\ndefense, slipped a precise pass\nthrough tor Hardy who slotted it into\nthe net with his left foot.\nFrom then on IC made things look\neasy. Wilson and Holland looked\ncomfortably elegant in the centre of\ndefense. Laverick and Dunthorne\nmade great use of the flanks, and J Wrcford the keeper wondered if he\nwas going to be required to do\nsomething worthy of a mention in the\nCollege newspaper.\nSemeria's persistent shooting led to\nIC's third goal, when his shot was\ndeflected leaving Russ Hardy to\narrogantly put away his second of the\nmatch. Goal number four came when\nBarrow passed to Keeling who then\nskinned' his defender with all the\ngrace of an ex-Sunderland school boy\nand shot home emphatically-champion y' know.\nTeam: J Wrcford.

Despite some\nappalling judging we managed to pick\nup two 2nd places, one in the jive, the\nother in cha-cha, to give the team 3rd place overall. Thanks go to Dave\nCaballero for stepping in at the last\nminute. Special mention must go to\nGill Knowles and Mike Carpenter\nwho were unable to dance owing to\ninjuries sustained by Mike in an\naccident. Both were extremely upset\nby not being able to compete, but\nthank you both for your keen support.\nThanks again go to Vicky for\ncoaching the team.\nFor details of competitions coming\nup soon, to which we'll be running\ncoaches, and for details of classes\nplease see the dance club noticeboard\non the walkway outside the JCR.\nNeil McCluskey\nPresident\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday February 27th19872 On with the\npointless\ngrind\nDear Dave,\nOn the subject of UGM attendance,\nmay I note the following:\ni) Poor attendance is intimately\nconnected with the general climate of\napathy that reigns in IC.\nii) People tend to be more apathetic\nin the subjects that require their\ncontribution towards a goal that\nserves the 'common good.'\niii) These subjects may be related\nto Union or other student activities,\ndecisions on political matters and\nespecially humanitarian work (eg\nAmnesty, Third World.)\nThe whole structure of studies is\nsuch that after three years far too\nmany people feel sick and tired of\ntheir courses. As a third year I find\nmyself under enormous work\npressure. I think that for most of us\nthere's no question of trying to get a good degree and spending time for\nother activities as well. We all knew\nfrom the beginning that IC would\nmean hard work, but we're not\nmerely faced with hard work here,\nwe're faced with over-crowded\ncourses where trying to learn masses\nof information destroys the beauty of\nscientific thinking.\nThis results in something else as\nwell>along with specific reasons such\nas those mentioned in Christine Taig's bit last week, poor attendance at\nUGM's and general apathy may be\nattributed to the fact that students of\nImperial do not feel part of it. There\nis virtually no such thing as an IC\ncommunity; we don't have the time\n(in the long run) to identify with IC\nor the Union; we don't belong to\nthem.\nAs long as the course structure\nremains as it is, having as an aim to\nproduce people for industry in the\nleast possible time (ie with the least\npossible expenditure), both our\ninterest in our courses and Union etc.\nactivities will be in great danger, to\nsay the least. It seems, therefore, that\nthe work of the people in the\nUnion\u2014which is very important\nindeed\u2014will go on finding no\nresponse or acknowledgement.\nThe few enthusiasts will have to\nwork bloody hard for seemingly\ninsignificant changes, for students that\ndon't give a damn but who do need\nthose enthusiasts. Abolishing UGMs\nand the like does not solve any of the\nproblems. So the (serious) suggestion\nis that you have to go on no matter\nhow pointless the task seems\nsometimes.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael Moutoussis, Physics III.\nSmug and\nself-righteous\nDear Dave,\nSorry to hog the letters page again,\nbut I'd like to set Rob Brown straight\non a few points he raised in his letter\nof last week, under the heading of 'In\nGod he trusts.'\nI do not wish to stamp my ethics\non society, and it is not true to say\nthat I have no time to listen to anyone\nelse. Most of all. I am not merely\ninsisting that my way is right, full\nstop. My ethics, as he terms them, are\nmy own; not everyone would wish to\nfollow them, and why should they?\nAll I want people to concede is that\nmy way is right for me, and for people\nlike me. and that this doesn't need to\naffect anyone else. Is that so difficult?\nApparently, at Imperial College it is:\nto moderate this attitude must be the\nmost compelling raison d'e tre of the\ngay and lesbian officer.\nI would also like to say that I, and\nI am sure many others, found Mr\nBrown's quote from New Society\nsmug and self-righteous in the\nextreme. There are lots of reasons\nwhy London's down-and-outs are\nwhat they are, and not all of these\ninvolve being \"smelly, noisy,\nnauseous, drunk and drugged.\"\nPeople may be reduced to living\nrough in London by sheer misfortune,\nof a kind which might break the writer\nof that offensive article.\nYou stick to your God and your\nNew Society, Mr Brown, and I 'll\nstick to my 'ethics.'\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Bannister, Geology I. \"Arbitrary\nrules\"\nDear FELIX,\nI am not surprised that people are\ncasually dismissive of God with\npeople like Rob Brown (Letters,\nFELIX 764) as his self-appointed\nmessenger. People like him seem to\nwant to reduce God to a series of rules\nmainly about what not to do with\none's genitals. If that is not the case,\nwhy did he mention gays at all, as I fail to see otherwise the connection\nof his opening paragraph with the rest\nof his letter.\nThe Christ one reads of in the\ngospels has little time for those whose\nreligion is merely preaching arb it ary rules, or picking out bits of scripture\nto reinforce their own prejudices. His\nmessage is one of social justice: how\none wishes some of the self-righteous\n'evangelical' Christians who abound\nat IC turned their attention to this\nmajor theme and left off their\nobsession with sex.\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Huntbach, Dept. of\nComputing.\nOf terrorists\nand the ANC\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to Y Mponella's letter (FELIX 764) I believe it is\nunfair to imply ignorance purely on\nthe grounds of holding an unpopular\nor differing-opinion. Furthermore,\nhe/she then expects to educate these\nso called ignorant people with a simplistic view of the situation which\nfavours the ANC. I am writing to\nintroduce a little reality into the\nargument.\nFirstly, I accept the presence of\nrefugees in neighbouring countries,\nunfortunately the ANC chooses to\nhide behind the civilians knowingly\nendangering the people they claim to\nrepresent. The governments of these\ncountries are aware of the presence\nof these terrorists but do nothing\nsubstantial to remove them.\nSecondly Y Mponella seems\nconfident of the future. \"I hope the\nANC....when it comes to power.\"\nThis seems to indicate a slide towards\ntotalitarianism as, for instance, the\nZulus appear to be forgotten. Could\nit be because the majority of Zulus\naccept peaceful change and reform?\nIndeed perhaps most of the population\nfavour reform, currently more black\npeople are joining the police force\nthan ever. There is no right way to\nend apartheid, just a best way by\nwhich the least people are hurt.\nThirdly, comparison with the\nSecond World War is ridiculous. The\nANC are not waging war, if they\nwere they would not be burning\ncivilians and leaving land mines for\ninnocent people to stumble across.\nThey do not consistently attack the\narmed forces, who expect the\npossibility of being killed, but instead\nintimidate the defenceless. This is my\nobjection to the terrorism of the ANC\nand terrorism everywhere, so\nhopefully this also answers Andrew\nPartington's letter also in FELIX 764.\nI would like to point out that the\nissue is being clouded by specific\nreference to South Africa, my first\nletter was an attempt to disregard the\nmorality of apartheid and concentrate\non the fight against terrorism. At least\nAndrew Partington understood this\nand wrote a relevant letter. As I have\nalready said I do not have a low, but\non the contrary a high, regard for\nhuman life, otherwise I would not\nwant to see it protected from\nterrorists.\nAlmost everyone can envisage a situation in which they would kill,\nmerely because some of us admit it\nmore readily, does not make us\nextremists. Death is a good deterrent\nunless facing a Jihad, which the\nmajority of terrorism isn't, as ter roi sts are generally out to further their own\nselfish ends and getting killed usually\nisn't one of them. This power lust is\nexactly the reason, for example, that\nif our forces withdrew from Northern\nIreland the terrorist factions would not\nform a coalition or whatever else\nAndrew Partington expects them to\ndo.\nlastly, I would like to apologise for\nassuming Ms Adenubi was a man. As\nyou might have guessed I am far from\nbrilliant with names; the odds were\nfour to one in my favour and still I got it wrong.\nYours sincerely,\nMike Allen, Physics I.

FELIX, Friday February 27th198712 Nicolas Roeg. director of Dew V Look\nNow and Tlie Man Who Fell to Earth\nhas come up trumps once again with\nhis latest film Castaway starring\nOliver Reed and newcomer Amanda\nDonohoe. The story begins with a small ad in Time Out. Lucy Irvine\n(Amanda Donohoe), discontented\nwith her job and life in London sees\nthe advertisement, \"writer seeks\n'wife' for year on tropical desert\nisland\" and seizes the chance to fulfill\nher dream of escape.\nHowever Castaway is much more\nthan a film of sunshine, sea and idyllic\nscenery. These are merely incidental\nand what the story really focusses on\nis the, relationship between Gerald\n(Oliver Reed) and Lucy. Happy at\nfirst in their new found freedom, they\nsoon realise that this Garden of Eden\nis going to need a lot of weeding.\nGerald becomes frustrated by Lucy's constant refusal of him sexually\u2014a refusal built on her own frustration at\nhis laziness. All this repressed sexual\ntension is brought to a head by the\narrival on the island of two virile\nAustralian men.\nBoth Oliver Reed and Amanda\nDonohoe give wonderful\nperformances. Reed as the eccentric\nwriter who takes great delight in\nreciting crude limericks while reading\nclassics secretly, and Donohoe as the\nindependent yet confused Lucy,\nprepared to go to any lengths to get\nwhat she wants.\nThe film is packed full of imagery,\nalmost to the point of predictability,\nbut this adds to its appeal and along\nwith some wonderful photography,\nsuperb scenery and great music make\nit a film I would recommend going\nto see.\nHelena Russell\nBased on the controversial novel by\nLucy Irvine. Castaway is the story of\na middle-aged man. Gerald Kingsland\n(Oliver Reed), who advertises in\nsearch of a younger woman to spend\na year with him on a deserted tropical\nisland. He finds Lucy Irvine (Amanda\nRevenue, she has a busy, tacky social\nlife. Gerald is looking for the 'right'\nwoman to accompany him, and\nfrequenting pubs. Life in London is\nrepresented as fast and hectic. I thought that when the scene moved on\nto the island the pace of the film\nTwo faces of\n\" Castaway\" Donohoe), and they go. The\ncontroversy caused by the novel arose\nbecause it was thought that Irvine's portrayal of Kingsland was unfair.\nThe film opens with a look at the\nlives of Irvine and Kingsland in\nLondon. Lucy works for the Inland\nwould relax, but this wasn't the case.\nWhen the couple are finally left on\nthe island of Tuin, the film becomes\npreoccupied with the fact that Lucy\nwon't have sex with Kingsland. This\nis fair enough as this is also a preoccupation of Irvine in the novel.\nThere is an attempt to give us\nKingsland's point of view on this\nissue as well as Irvine's, which is fair\nenough too. While Irvine is\ngallivanting energetically around the\nisland, making love to the sun and\nflirting with two young Australian he-men who arrive to deliver the\nAustralian census forms, Kingsland\nsits at 'home' sweetly looking after\nhis unproductive vegetable garden,\nreading his one copy of a newspaper,\nand a book on how to communicate\nbetter, and, when it is available,\ndrinking beer. Whenever Lucy\nreturns home Gerald calls her a bitch\nor tries to jump on top of her. But\ndespite all this the couple develop a genuine affection for one another in\ntheir efforts to survive.\nThe film tries to depict Irvine's intense emotional reaction to Tuin,\nand her frustration and sense of\nfailure when Kingsland gives up on\nsimply surviving and starts a business\nwith the friendly inhabitants of a neighbouring island. The film tries\ntoo hard to be interesting in what\nseem to be inappropriate ways, that\nis, it packs too much action in, and\nin its attempt to be fair to both\ncharacters, makes too much of the\ncharacter of Kingsland, he is\nendearing but unoriginal. Being fair\nis nice but it can be boring, the film\nwould have been better if it had given\nmore of Irvine's thoughts and left us\nto make up our own minds about her\nfeelings toward Kingsland and the\nisland. At least then it would have had\na focus, as it is the film isn't sure\nwhether it is about getting on with\nsomeone, lack of communication,\nsexual frustration, age gaps, or\nsurvival.\nCatherine Monolopoulos\nSouth Africa1 he media is full of news stories of\nevents in South Africa in the sea of\nemotional response to apartheid. It is\nrare to find a clear, cool account of\nwhat the political trends in that\ncountry are. In his book South Africa\nGraham Leach. BBC Southern Africa\nRadio correspondent, has produced\njust that\u2014an up-to-date guide to the\ncomplex situation behind the events\nin South Africa. He draws on his\nexperience on the front-line, and his\ntalks with key figures across the\npolitical and racial divide to produce\na lively incisive account of recent\ndevelopments.\nMr Leach provides vital\nbackground to South Africa's racial\ncauldron\u2014the Afrikaner, the whites\nof British descent, the Zulus, the\nXhosa. the Swazi. the Ndebele and\nthe Sotho. He traces the rise of the\nAfrikaner, the development of the so\ncalled la ager mentality, and the\neventual emergence of apartheid. The\nAfrikaner, steeped in Calvanist\ntradition, saw no reason to doubt that\napartheid was in keeping with\nscripture, for every race and nation\nwould be performing the greatest\nservice to God and the world if it kept\nits own attributes.\nMr Leach outlines the major pieces\nof legislation under which petty and\ngrand apartheid policy was enforced.\nHe is. however, at his incisive best\nin accounting the country's most\nrecent history\u2014the changing face of\napartheid. He takes us through the\nconstitutional reforms, the schism that\noccurred in the Ruling National Party,\nthe vehement opposition to such\nreforms from the right-wing parties,\nthe emergence of the UDF, the\ndilemma faced by Indians and\nColoureds in participating in Botha's plans.\nMr Leach allows the reader to try\nand assess whether the recent reforms\nare really an indication that the\ngovernment is sincerely paving the\nway towards peaceful change. Can\napartheid be dismantled peacefully or\nis violent revolution inevitable? How\nfar would the whites be prepared to\nmove in surrendering their power?\nWhat form will a solution need to\ntake? It seems that minorities would\nwant to receive guarantees that they\nwould not be disadvantaged,\nsuppressed or destroyed by the\nmajority. How could this be done?\nWould a federal option be feasible?\nWould the blacks accept anything less\nthan one-man, one-vote in a unitary\nstate? Mr Leach feels that at the end\nof the day the most crucial factor for\nthe whites may prove to be not so\nmuch the political guarantees they\nwould require, but rather assurances\nabout the nature of the economic\nsystem which would apply under a black-led government.\nDoes the slogan of Kwame\nNkrumah of Ghana\u2014\"Seek ye first\nthe political kingdom and all else will\nfollow\"\u2014apply? Surely, while\nestablishing political rights, economic\nand other matters should not be\noverlooked.\nSouth Africa will remain a burning\nissue for sometime.

Eleven flats, almost completely\noccupied by overseas families, will be\nlost when Sandyride House and its\ncottages are sold.\nCollege has proposed to use the\nmoney obtained from the sale, and a \u00a310,000 loan to build two new blocks\nof accommodation. One block will\ncomprise of 6 two-bedroom flats and\nthe other will contain 14 study\nbedrooms.\nThe Union Silwood Park Working\nParty on the future development has\nexpressed its concern to College about\nthe loss of family accommodation and\nclaims that the decision is biased\nagainst overseas students. They point\nout in their report that 70% of the\noverseas students at Silwood are\nmarried and over 75% of the married\nstudents have children. At present. 10\nfamilies live outside Silwood. at\ndistances of up to30 miles due to the\ninflated rents around the site. The\nWorking Party also has questioned the\nneed for more single student\naccommodation as the Silwood\npopulation has been dec re sing due to\nthe loss of Ashurst Lodge. It has been\nsuggested that accommodation for the\nTechnology Tranfer Centre's short\ncourse students should be provided by\nthe College and that the true purpose\nbehind the extra single\naccommodation is for this reason.\nCurrent long term students are housed\nin second rate accommodation.\nThe Union has proposed in the\nWorking Party's report to College\nthat long term students should be\nmoved to the new block and the old\nblocks refurbished and used to house\nthe short course students. They also\nwant to see the farm converted into\nflats for married students with\nchildren to replace those lost in the\nSunnyride sale.\nMr Hector Cameron Clark. Head\nof Estates Section at Silwood Park,\ntold FELIX that the College were not\nrequired to provide accommodation\nfor married students. This is a UGC\ndecision and College are only\nfollowing this judgement.\nNot cricket at Sussex\nSussex University Student Union is\nunder attack from the college\nadministration, which aims to take\nfull control of student funding. The\nmove follows a ten day occupation of\nthe university administration building,\nSussex House, by a group of nearly\nfifty students. The students were\nprotesting about cuts at the university,\nwhich would involve 90 job losses,\nthe closure of libraries, and the\nclosure of the post graduate school.\nA spokesman for the union\nadmitted that during the course of the\ndemonstration nearly three thousand\npounds worth of damage was caused,\nbut added that this was confined to\ndoors which had been forced on\nentry, and filing cabinets which were\nbroken open at a later stage. The\ncontents of these cabinets were found\nto include files on politically active\nstudents at the university. All the\nstudents involved in the action now\nface disciplinary hearings, and could\nface penalties ranging from a \u00a3100\nfine to expulsion from the university.\nAs a result of the incident, the\nunion was fined \u00a374,000 by the\nuniversity administration, which has\nleft them with no funding for the\nremainder of this year.

UC. Bans and\nLondon Hospital among the\ncontenders. The wind was reported to\nbe a strong force 6. gusting gale force\n8. so 3 rolls in the main were the\norder of the day to avoid capsizes.\nAfter de-icing rigging and tuning the\nboats, the day began.\nIC 1 against UC were in the first\nrace. However, it was left to Richard\nand Sam. Ape and Helen to battle it\nout while the other boat re-captured\nits jib again just in time to get out and\nhelp finish with a124 combination\n(which means for the lesser yellow\nwell ies among you that we came 1st.2 nd and 4th out of 6 boats!)\nThe second race IC I sailed was\nalso skilfully won. 1-2-6. despite once\nof the boats missing the start because\nit was full of water and missing a rudder.\nThe third race IC I sailed was\nagainst IC II and this was won with\na123 finish and, miraculously no\ngear failure!\nAs to who won the race against\nQMC just before lunch was much\ndebated and although IC I skilfully\ngained 2nd.3 rd and 4th positions\nthereby winning on the water, the\noutcome was never fully decided.\nAfter lunch the course changed for\nthe 3rd time leading to great\nconfusion all round but we sailed on\nto qualify for the finals.\nUnder full mainsail, as the wind\nhad dropped to a blustery force 5 by\nthis time, it was to be IC I against\nQMC in the finals, the team with least\npoints after 2 races would take home\nthe trophy.\nIC skilfully manoeuvre da good\nstart although Ape collected 2 greens\nin the process (% point each) Richard\ngave out a green at the next mark and\ntook one later on in the race. Dave\ngave out two greens to the opposition\nand we finished in the lead by % of\na point.\nWe swapped boats with our\nopponents for the final race and\nfought it out to the bitter end. We\nmight have won the trophy is it hadn't been for one of the team getting tired\nof playing cat-and-mouse on the start\nline and going for a swim in the icy\nwater instead. But then?...\n1st Team: R Brimelow, S Page,\nA Leonidhopolous, H Udy, D Ijarkham, A Burrows,\nIC 2nds Small fry\nAfter an early start on Saturday the\nIC 2nd sailing team gathered at the\nWelsh Harp for their major test of the\nyear. How to be a i sailors from all the\nother colleges in London University\nas well as our own first team? The\nevent was organised with two round-robin series from which the best two\nteams would be selected to contest the\nfinal. This meant we had a lot of\nracing to do in one day. After a slightly shaky start against QMC (the\neventual winners); where only\nRichard Jarman was able to offer any\nform of attack due to a near capsize\nby Charles Oxley; the team steadily\nimproved until their last match of the\n1st series against our own 1st team.\nBy using aggressive starting tactics\nthe 2nds were able to take two\npenalties from the l sts but lacked the\nboat speed to be able to keep up and\nfinished 4.5.6.\nHaving finished the first series\nwithout winning a race but coming\nvery close in all the second series\npromised to be more rewarding.\nAgain the team were out manoeuvre d by QMC. Against UC we showed\nmore spirit. Charles Oxley getting in\namongst the UC boats and causing\nthem some problems as well as having\nhis own working out what the course\nwas whilst leading the race. St.\nBartholomew proved to be easy meat,\nhaving sailed one lap of the race there\nwas time for one boat to make a slight\npit stop thus confusing the opposition\nenough to allow Adam Storke to sail\nthrough to the front. With some useful\nteam racing IC won easily.\nOur last race of the day against IC\nl sts was another grudge match. The\n2nds battled hard and made the 1st work very hard for their win. This left\nQMC and IC l sts to contest the final\nwith the 2nds finishing 5th overall.\nThroughout the day the second team\nshowed signs of what they are capable\nof and what IC Ists will be like in the\nfuture.\n2nd Team: C Oxley, A Stork, M Hunter, D Lucas-Clements, D Hobbs, R Jarman.\nMens Hockey\nMiddlsex League\nIC 1st13, UCL 1st12 cylinders\nOn a day on which IC were decidedly\noff colour (partially accounted for by\nthe activities of several players the\nprevious night), they did very well to\nwin an exciting, if slightly scrappy\ngame by the odd goal.\nEverything started according to\nplan with IC easily dominating the\nearly stages. However, it needed an\nerror from the UCL goalie for IC to\nopen their account\u2014Hari Vamadevan\nbeating the UCL defenders to the\nloose ball and calmly slotting it into\nthe open goal. IC continued to create\nexcellent goal scoring opportunities,\nnotably Justin Brooking scooping the\nball over the cross-bar from 4 yards.\nIt was half way through the first half\nwhen IC began to lose their way and\nthe defence looked increasingly\nvulnerable to the hard running UCL\ncentre forward. On just such a run by\nhim a sloppy stick tackle by an IC\ndefender in the 'D'( penalty area)\nresulted in UCL being awarded a penalty flick which was converted to\nbring them level. With IC still reeling\nfrom this blow a UCL forward sie zed upon a loose ball in the 'D', which\nIC had had ample opportunity to\nclear, to slip the ball past a hesitant\nPhil Choudhury in goal to make the\nscore 1-2 at the interval.\nAfter an aggressive team talk from\ncaptain Jon Stonham IC came out into\nthe 2nd with all cylinders firing. After\nmuch concerted pressure the\ninevitable happened and IC equalise d, Hari Vamadevan neatly deflecting, on\nhis reverse stick, a cross from the\nright past a surprised and rather slow\nUCL goalie. With IC now pushing all\nout for the winner, it left Phil\nChoudhury exposed at the back one\noccasion, but he responded well to\nmake a quick interception with 2 UCL\nforwards bearing down on him. Just\nas it seemed a win would evade the\ngrasp of IC, with numerous chances\ngoing begging, Jeremy Barsington\nbravely launched himself at a shot\ngoing inches wide of the post and\nsuperbly turned it inside the goal to\ngive IC their much deserved winner.\nSPORTS RESULTS TABLE Football IC 2nds2 Badminton Mens Doubles\nIC 2\nIC 5\nIC 9\nTable Tennis Garden Hall 6\nGarden Hall 7\nS.O.P0 Spartans 7\nKensington Inst 4\nWhitton 9\nLinstead Hall 3\nWeeks Hall 2\nMens Hockey \u2014 Mid dx.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday February 27th19876 The Fly opened in London on Friday\n13th February (and was reviewed in\nthe FELIX issue of the same date).\nThe director is a mild-mannered 42\nyear old Canadian dubbed variously\n'The Baron of Blood', 'The Prince of\nhorror and Dave 'Deprave'\nCronenberg.\nCanada must have been a hard\nplace for an aspiring young film\nmaker to become a success. There is\nno studio system in Canada to speak\nof, and this means two things; firstly,\nthere are no big financiers who will\nput up money for films. Secondly,\ntherefore, there are not many\nbank able Canadian stars to be found\nworking in Canada.\nThe logic runs like this: only big\nbudget films are successful,\nrewarding their backers with profits.\nTherefore a Canadian film is going to\nneed more money than its group of\nsmall-time investors will ever be able\nto put up. The Government, in the\nguise of the Canadian Film\nDevelopment Corporation will help\nby supplementing the budget. But\nnow. since the film is using\nGovernment money, it must have\nCanadian leading players. And\nbecause there aren't many of these\nwho are well known where it counts\n(ie: the USA. Europe, etc) the film,\nonce made, is pretty unlikely to be\nsuccessful. This partly-vicious circle\nhence imposes a limit, or 'ceiling\ninvestment' on what potential backers\nwill put into a film. However, the\ncircle is only partly-vicious because,\nby its very nature, it encourages\nselection of only the best from the\ndirectors working within it. And it\nwas from this system that David\nCronenberg emerged.\nIt was at university, with some\nstudent friends, that Cronenberg\ndiscovered the medium of film,\ndelighting in its possibilities of\nexpression. Even at this early stage\nhis uncanny ability at blending\ntogether the macabre with scientific\nand literary themes is clearly\napparent, especially in two of his first\nshort films. From the Drain and\nTransfer. Transfer is described by\nCronenberg, who wrote,\nphotographed, directed and edited the\nfilm as 'a surreal sketch for two\npeople\u2014a psychiatrist and his\npatient\u2014at a table set for dinner in the\nmiddle of a field covered in snow.\nThe ph y chi atri st has been followed\nthere by his obsessive former patient\nFrom the Drain has two men sitting\nin a bath discussing the changes that\nare occurring in the biology of both\nman and plants. Whilst one of these\nmutated plants comes up from the\ndrain and kills one of the men the\nother merely watches, and then takes\nall that is left\u2014a pair of shoes\u2014and\nstores them in a cupboard, which is\nalready full of shoes of previous\nvictims. It becomes obvious that all\nthis is a plot to prevent veterans\ntalking publicly about 'the War'. Both\nof these films are strongly surrealist;\nthe events pass before the viewer's eyes as if they were a dream.\nStereo and Crimes of the Future\nestablished for Cronenberg a Blood Baron FELIX film buff Charles Robin looks back at the career and\nfilms of the controversial Canadian director David\nCronenberg\nreputation for fresh technique, good\nscript writing and courage in putting\nwhat he wanted up onto the screen.\nBoth films deal with the physical and\nintellectual implications of genetic\nmutation and experimentation on the\nhuman mind and body. In the former,\nthe soundtrack consists of three\nnarrators, and nothing else. They\ndescribe, using pseudo-scientific\nphrases and long, intricate sentences,\na highly organised and carefully\norchestrated experiment in which\n\"Eight category A subjects\nunderwent pattern brain surgery to\nmake them telepathic\".\nIn Crimes of the Future, a dermatologist, whilst trying to cure\nlethal skin conditions caused by\ncosmetics, creates Rouge's Malady,\nresulting in the eradication of the post-pu bert al female population. The\nsoundtrack is the musings of the\nprotege of the scientist who caused the\ncatastrophe, and the film has one\nsection in slow motion\u2014the closing\nsequence, where the narrator starts\ncrying as he impregnates a five year\nold girl before she passes puberty and\nbecomes a victim of the Malady.\nWith these two works 'tucked\nunder his arm' Cronenberg made his\nway to the Cannes Film Festival\u2014\nand promptly realised that nothing\nlike what he was offering had ever\nbeen seen before. So he beat a hasty\nretreat to the French countryside and\ndecided that he had to have something\nmore 'commercially viable' to show\nto the public and communicate his\nideas. With partial funding from the\nCFDC, Shivers' (also known as The\nParasite Murders, They Came from\nWithin) was made.\nIn Shivers, parasites are symbolic\nof the recurring nightmare in\nCronenberg's films\u2014cancer.\n(Cronenberg watched his own father\ndie of the disease, and this obviously\ndeeply moved him). These parasites\nare implanted in patients by a surgeon\nas a substitute for the organ\ntransplants that they want. He wishes\nto develop a parasite that, when\nimplanted int a host, could isolate the\nmalfunctioning organ, consume it and\nthen replace it, duplicating its function\nexactly and forming a symbiotic\nrelationship with the patient.\nUnfortunately the surgeon's experiments have gone wrong, and\nthe parasites grow and divide in the\nbodies of their hosts, secreting\nenzymes which turn them into sex-crazed machines. The parasite,\nliterally an aphrodisiac crossed with\nvenereal disease, is deliberately\ndesigned to be repulsive. Cronenberg\nexhibits an almost puritan disgust at\nthe promiscuity of the inhabitants of\nthe sterile star liner complex in which\nthe film takes place.\nFast Company is something of a departure from Cronenberg's firmly\nestablished territory in the horror\ngenre\u2014it isn't even horror. The film\nis about drag racing\u2014and drag\nracing\u2014and drag racing. All tar ted up\nwith a little humour, sex and violence.\nCronenberg says of it: \"Fast\nCompany is really about men and\nmachines.\" The drivers put on cold,\nunemotional helmets that make them\nfeatureless robots. They are strapped\ninto their cars, becoming half-man,\nhalf-car organisms. In a recent\ninterview with Time Out, Cronenberg\nsaid of Fast Company: \" A lot of\npeople think it's an anomaly, but it's as much me as Videodrome or\nanything else.\" The fact that\nCronenberg ever agreed to direct Fast\nCompany is probably more to do with\nhis own obsession with motor cars\nand bikes.\nThe Brood, Cronenberg's fourth\n'proper' film, was made just after his\nmarriage broke up. In it, the science\nof 'psycho plasm ics' allows patients to\nrelease their anxiety and anger by\nmanifesting the emotion in their\nbodies.\nThe film is an allegorical tale about\nthe breakdown of a marriage. The\nfrustration, fear and anger of the\nmother is manifested as a brood of\nmurderous 'children of rage.'\nCronenberg described the film as his\nown personal Kramer vs Kramer, in\nwhich the mother's emotion is\nexpressed with immeasurably more\nforce than Meryl Streep's custody\ncase.\nScanners marks Cronenberg's first\nreal commercial impact on the\ncinematic public. Before, his films\nwere regarded by most as exploitation\npic s. People went to see Scanners,\nand were inspired to pay more\nattention to his earlier films as a result.\nScanners are people blessed (or\ncursed\u2014it's up to the viewer to\ndecide) with the ability to lock onto\nthe nervous systems of other people,\nread their minds, control them, and\nultimately kill them. In the celebrated\nopening scene, a scanner explodes a man's head. The film is concerned\nwith the way in which these scanners\n(of which there are relatively few\u2014\nabout 200) have split into two\nopposing factions because of their\npowers. One group wish only to live\nin peace: the other group are virtual\nfascists. The hero scanner, Cameron\nVale, passes from the security\norganisation ComSec who wish to use\nscanners as tools of espionage, to the\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday February 20th19875 Walter's bit\nWaller is pleased to observe that the\nconstruction of the new Department\nof Computing premier is proceeding\napace. Not being a civil engineer he\ncannot comment on the design but to\nthe tyro it does appear to be a case\nof rather large girders held together\nwith rather small bolts. He can\nenvisage the future case, in the event\nthat someone has miscalculated, of the\nDepartment of Computing operating\nin one storey, two foot high, wall to\nwall steel pancake, although this\nwould probably be preferable to their\ncurrent accommodation.\nAlthough next year's sabbaticals\nare immune to the power of the\npen\u2014for the moment\u2014this year's are\nstill providing their customary fun.\nSpecifically, Mr. D.I. Colley, whose\nlegendary hunger led him at one point\nto eat an election paper. The place has\nbeen alive with nasty rumours, and\nWalter being the gentleman he is, has\nrecorded every one, hoping to distill\nfact from fiction. Alas, it is\nimpossible! Which only goes to prove\nthat one shouldn't listen to rumours,\neven if they are started by the current\nHonorary Secretary.\nWalter is desolate, yes damm it desolate, to observe this week that the\nactions in certain unmentionables in\nstanding for sabbatical posts has\nrobbed him of his main source of\nentertainment, as sabbatical\ncandidates are ip so facto hands off to\nthe press. However, some events at\nthe Union General Meeting seem to\nmerit a word or three.\nWalter was delighted to observe, in\nthis plastic world, that some good soul\nproposed the abandonment of plastic\nknives, forks and glasses in the Union\nbars. He was rather less delighted to\nsee the motion summarily thrown out.\nOn the subject of the Union bars,\ncongratulations to the RSM for\nwinning the football and the hockey,\nif not the rugby, at their bottle match\nagainst Cambourne last Saturday. No\ncongratulations at all for inviting them\nback to the bars for a few drinks,\nalthough one result of this was to\npromote the fastest 20 yard dash yet.\nrecorded by Mr. Northey. On seeing\na fire hose turned on his beloved pizza\nshack, he moved with a most\nremarkable speed for one of sedentary\nhabits, sweeping down the shutters\nand closing the bar with a most\ndramatic flourish.\nMr. Northey's gain was the loss of\nthe Union Bar, which suffered an\nincursion of Cornish genetic muto ids intent on mayhem. Not so were the\nsecurity staff, who acted on the latest\nmaster plan of Mr. Reeves: Do\nnothing...with the result that Mr.\nColley started another ulcer, and\nCouncil on Monday heard a suggestion from Hurrican Christine\nthat Cambournians should be banned.\nThis, of course, came to now t. Walter apologise s for this weeks\nlack of material, but informs his\nreaders that things should warm up\nas soon as the elections are over. And\nyou never know, we may yet hear\nfrom Southside shop, who have not\nyet responded to last weeks icy\nWalterian blast. Nor have they\nlowered their prices...\nOne final thing: Walter suggests\nthat Mr. Royle should make contact\nwith someone about his taste for\nflagellation. This someone must\nremain unnamed for the nonce, but\nin a few weeks...publish and be\ndamned!\nEarlier this week, Walter listened\nwith interest to the sound of Mr\nRichard G. Fincher on IC Radio. He\ncongratulates Mr. Fincher for such a remarkable performance in one so\nyoung, but he feels obliged to observe\nthat if the young gentleman devoted\nhimself more to his school curriculum\nand less to broadcasting, he would\nfind himself better prepared when he\nis old enough to come to Imperial\nCollege as a student.\nFinally, Walter would like to\napologise to readers for his absence\nfrom these pages last week\u2014gossip\nwas short and column space was\nshorter: Et tu. Editor?\nNews, glorious News,\nBackstroke Computer shops have always suffered\nfrom people typing swear words into\ntheir display models and have them\nprinted in large letters on the screen.\nInfuriated at having \"Johnny is aw*** ker\" splattered in green all\nacross the screen, they have decided\nto retaliate against this menace with\na battery of countermeasures.\nEach micro now comes complete\nwith a 'swear-filter' which roots out\nany offending words and replaces\nthem with more socially acceptable\nphrases such as \"not very nice\" or\n\"Mary Whitehouse.\" As an\nadditional deterrent a speech\nsynthesizer can be hooked up which\ngenerates em baras sing messages such\nas \"This person is a pervert.\"\nGiven the popularity of foreign\nfilms like Diva and Betty Blue\namongst young aesthetes these days,\nan alternative theatre group operating\nfrom Islington has decided to stage a production of Candide in the original\nFrench with subtitles. Actors deliver\ntheir lines in French while extras enter\ncarrying placards with the English\ntranslation.\nJames Houston of the group\nexplains: \"The play sounds much\nbetter in Voltario's original version,\nhowever, we want to bring the play\nto aw ider audience, and the only way\nwe can do it is with subtitles.\"\nLast Tuesday, the first issue of Robert\nMaxwell's new London newspaper\ncame out. The long-awaited London\nDaily News is printed round the clock\nat a rate of five editions a day. It is\naimed at a sector of the market which\nis occupied safely by The London\nEvening Standard. The Standard\nwhich is owned by Associated\nNewspapers, whose chairman is Lord\nRothermere, swallowed its only\nprevious com pet ion, the Evening\nNews seven years ago and has been\nthe only London Daily ever since.\nIn comparison with the Standard,\nI think it stands up very well. The first\nissue was noticeably thicker with\nsixty-four pages, but this may not\noutlast the extra effort involved with\nthe launch edition. It is, in my view,\na lot easier to find one's way about\nthe News than the Standard,\nmoreover, the headings are a lot\nbolder making it easier to pick up the\nsnippets of news that are of particular\ninterest.\nAs far as content goes, there is little\nto choose between them. They both\nopt for a similar mix of news and\ngossip and they both give a sound\nbasis for Labour's claims of a 'Tory'\npress, with uncomplimentary reports\non the 'loony left' councils, but the\nStandard excels itself with a long\narticle by Norman Tebbit while the\nNews redresses the balance somewhat\nwith an article on the Greenwich by-election sympathetic to Deirdre\nWood, the Labour candidate.\nPredictably on the issue of their\nown rivalry the News is loud and the\nStandard is silent. The News has a front page article on its own launch,\nan editorial claiming the Standard is\n'running scared' and a long article on\nwhat it sets out to do. The only clue\nin the Standard that the News exists\nat all is an article describing the\nrelaunch of the Evening News\u2014Lord\nRothermere's answer to the London\nDaily News\u2014which doesn't even\nmention Robert Maxwell's new\npaper.\nIn the very important\nentertainments section, the News\nagain comes off better. Its headings\nare a lot clearer, making it easier to\nfind what you want and the cinema\nsection contains a brief sentence on\neach film as well as the times, place\nand age rating. All the entertainment\nin the news comes out in a handy pullout section. The theatre coverage in\nthe Standard is, however, more\nextensive.\nIn spite of my rather low opinion\nof Robert Maxwell, I would\nrecommend his paper above the\nStandard, at least for the moment. It\nis remarkably free from his odious\nvalues. If the population of London\nagree with me, the Standard will\nundoubtedly improve, to the benefit\nof all.\n\n"

Is\nit perhaps that the job prospects for\nIC students are particularly good,\nmaking a lot of potentially suitable\ncandidates eager to go out into the big\nwide world and earn lots of money?\nIt all gives me a slightly uneasy\nfeeling. Were we fools to take on the\nposts in the beginning or are we just\na hard act to follow?...\nEnvironmental Week\nSpeaking of the big wide world... it's no secret that there won't be much of\nit left his time next century if\nhumankind continues along its present\ncourse. I 've never understood why\npeople who speak out against the\nde ve stating depletion of the earth's resources, and the horrific pollution\nof the air, soil and water we depend\non, are.so often dismissed as wooly-headed cranks. (Mind you, as\nSchumaker said, what's wrong with\nbeing a crank?\u2014It's a small,\ninexpensive tool that makes\nrevolutions...)\nA concern for the environment we\nlive in doesn't just mean saving the\nsmall cute furry animals\u2014it means\nlong-term survival for all of us. It is\nalso something which cuts across\ntraditional political barriers\u2014as next\nweek should show.\nI'd like to wish the organisers of\nEnvironmental Week the best of luck;\nand I hope loads of people will take\npart. The least we can do as scientists\nand engineers is think about the\nimpact of our work upon the future\nof the planet.\nSecret Society\nThere is a strangely secretive\natmosphere to this College\nsometimes. For instance\u2014whilst the\nStudents' Union is asked to produce\nquite detailed recommendations on\nthe merger with St. Mary's, the\ncampus Trades Unions hear almost\nnothing\u2014except rumours from their\nSt. Mary's counterparts, who, it\nseems, are far better informed. They\nare left to worry about the effects of\na merger upon their jobs and\nconditions. For instance again, the\nstudents at Silwood are unaware that\ntheir facilities are to be rented out to\ncompanies using the new 'Science\nPark' at Silwood, until somebody puts\nup on the noticeboard a copy of an\nagreement to that effect.\nI wouldn't necessarily say that there\nis anything malicious about this\nsecrecy; it just seems that it doesn't occur to anybody in the College\nadministration to keep interested\nparties informed. This, despite\nconstant assurances that we are all\npart of the 'College Community?'\nThis lack of information and\ncommunication is doing a great deal\nto damage any sense of community\nthat the College has. Life would be\na lot easier and more relaxed for\neveryone at College if those in\npossession of information didn't wait\nfor aggrieved students and staff to\ncome knocking on their doors before\nbeing prepared to distribute it.\nChristine\nDon't talk to me\nabout life!\nI can think of few things to commend\nthis universe to prospective entrants.\nTo all unborn souls I say don't bother\nto get born here, it really isn't worth\nit.\nThe worst things about this\ntime/place are the physical laws. To\nstart with, there's a thing called the\nTheory of Relativity, which says that\nyou can't travel faster than this\nincredibly dilatory thing called light.\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY' S GARAGE75% discount on labour for IC\nstudents and staff\n(Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE\nMEWS\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\nwhich at a mere 3x l08m/s, rules out\ncivilisations bigger than planets.\nGreat for prospective hermits and\ncompulsive prisoners...As if this\nweren't enough, there are the three\nlaws of thermodynamics which say,\nrespectively: \"You can't win,\" \"You\ncan't break even\" and \"You can't play the game.\" The corollary of this\nis that, in the fullness of time, the\nuniverse will consist entirely of\nlukewarm lumps of iron.\nAnyway, if you have to choose this\nuniverse don't have anything to do\nwith a planet called earth. It has very\nfew things seriously right with it. It\nis an evil twist of fate, that on this\nbenighted planet those nations that\nhave best solved their physical\nproblems make a virtue out of being\nunhappy. Happiness and enjoyment\nare crimes for which one must feel\nvery guilty.\nOne of the greatest pleasures of any\nfinite existence is communication with\nlike minded beings, or friends.\nIndeed, of all the many millions with\nwhom you could make friends, you\nare liable to meet just a handful. Very\noften you get into the exceptionally\nperverse situation of people knowing\nyou well enough not to want to know\nyou well. But in this madhouse, it\ndoes not do to pretend that one\nanything less than ecstatically happy.\nTo check up on this, everyone asks\neveryone else how they are, at regular\nintervals.\nThe obvious solution to this\nproblem is for everyone to return to\noblivion; but his won't do either. The\nmost popular religion on the planet\nteaches that individuals returning\nthemselves to oblivion, will end up,\nnot in oblivion, but in excruciating\ntorture for all eternity. And if you try\nto return to oblivion, people will go\nto extraordinary lengths to prevent\nyou. They will even do it by physical\nforce! Whoever started project Earth\nused the highly unscrupulous\ntechnique of incorporating love of\nlife, or more accurately, fear of\noblivion (the so-called 'death') into\nthe physical framework of\ninhabitants. This ensured the\ncontinued existence of the project.\nThis devious trick has affected even\nsuch enlightened and dispassionate\nobservers as myself. I am too\nfrightened to return to oblivion of my\nown accord and so will not, barring\nan accident, be returning for the time\nbeing.\nNeedless to say this article is highly\nsac religious and would be either\nroundly condemned or passed for\nmeaningless rubbish were it ever\npublished on earth. So for those of\nyou unfortunate enough to get born\nin this awful place, the only pleasure\nI have been able to isolate, without\nunpleasant after or side-effects; is\ngetting into a hot bath with cold feet.\nFrancis Miers\n\n"

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday February 27th19874 Garden mix\nDear Professor Ash,\nI am writing to you on behalf of the\nresidents of Garden Hall to express\nour dissatisfaction at this hall being\nan all male residence.\nIt is a view widely held within\nGarden Hall that the ab sec ne of\nfemale residents creates an artificial\natmosphere which is less pleasant to\nlive in than that of the other halls, all\nof which are mixed. It is generally felt\nthat the presence of female residents\nwould phan ge this artificiality, since\nwomen usually exert a pacifying,\ncivil ising influence on others\u2014as the\nother halls show.\nTo demonstrate the depth of feeling\non this issue, I enclose a petition\nsigned by over 90% of the hall's residents\u2014an overwhelming\nmajority\u2014who agreed that, in\nprinciple, Garden Hall should cease\nto be an all male hall of residence.\nOf course, there are practical\ncons e rations too. However, I am\nassured by the hall's Subwarden, Mr.\nIvor Ellul, that he has already\nconsidered the problems which would\narise and is satisfied they can be\nsolved.\nThe residents of Garden Hall have\nmade their views clear, and await\nfurther developments with interest.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Bottomley (Garden Hall\nre applicant for 1987/88).\nFELIX fails to\ninform\nSir,\nWe would like to complain in the\nstrongest possible terms about the\ninability of FELIX, and Imperial\nCollege Union in general, to inform\nstudents about anything occurring\noutside the walls of this ivory tower,\nknown as Imperial College.\nLast Saturday, around 25,000\nstudents took part in a demonstration\nto protest about the current state of\nstudent finances. Although held in\nLondon, students came from all parts\nof the country, from as far away as\nScotland and Northern Ireland, to join\nthe march, which started at County\nHall and culminated in a rally held in\nHyde Park, only a quarter of a mile\naway from Imperial.\nHowever, there was no mention of\nthis major event in FELIX. Indeed,\nICU seemed totally unaware of it, and\nconsequently so were the vast\nmajority of students at IC. The first\nwe heard about it was when it was\nreported on the peak time national\nnews on BBC1.\nAdmittedly, the rally was organised\nby the NUS, of which Imperial,\nrightly or wrongly, is not a part. But\nsurely the individual should be able\nto decide whether or not to take part\nin such a campaign, of the utmost\nimportance to the average student. It\nis a severe indictment of the self-centred attitude (or could it be\nineptitude) of ICU that they did not\nknow about this event, and so we\nwere denied the opportunity to\nparticipate.\nThis is by no means the first time\nthat students at Imperial have been\nunable to take part in organised\nstudent gatherings, either on a national scale, as in this case, or\nsimply for London based colleges,\nbecause of the failure of ICU and its\nrelevant societies (eg Socialist\nSociety) to tell its members that they\nare taking place.\nPerhaps there was some official\nrepresentation by so-called 'Union\nhacks.' But if ICU did know of the\nrally, then surely the Union has\nabdicated its responsibility to the\ngeneral body of students by keeping\nthis information from them. If they\ndid not know of such an important\nexpression of student views, then we\nwould question the effectiveness of\nthe Union as the representative body\nof Imperial Students.\nYours faithfully,\nPeter Othen, Physics II\nRobin Choudbury, Physics II\nRichard Whatmough, Chemistry II\nDaniel Walker, Elec. Eng. PG.\nEd's note\nMy apologies for the lack of\npublicity for this march. The reason\nwas very simple\u2014/forgot about it. If\nany of Messrs Othen, Choudbury,\nWhatmough, or Walker would like to\njoin the FELIX news staff I would be\ndelighted to meet them\u2014give me a ring on 3515.\nSUBWARDEN\nMontpelier Hall\nApplications are invited for the\npost of Subwarden of\nMontpelier Hall. The\nSubwarden's duties are to\nassist the Warden in the day to\nday running of the Hall, and in\nsocial and disciplinary matters.\nIn return, he/she will be\nprovided with rent-free\naccommodation. The\nsuccessful candidate should be\na full-time post-graduate\nstudent at Imperial College.\nApplications/Enquiries to:\nKevin O' Conner The Warden Montpelier Hall\nThe closing date for\napplications is March 6th1987. Because of the nature of the FELIX\neditor's job, and my bad planning, I frequently find myself returning to\nSouthside Hall at around 4-5am. This\nis not something I choose to do. There\nappear to be many IC students who\nlike nothing better than spending the\nentire night-time watching their\nfriends playing space invaders. I can\njust about see the attraction of trying\nto zap the Martians/Venusians/\nUranians before you get zapped, but\nhow anyone can spend any length of\ntime watching someone else play\n(sometimes in groups of around 12)\nhas yet to be explained to me. Perhaps\nI am being too cynical (Impossible!\u2014\ntypesetter); perhaps this particular\n\"IC intellect\" is a result of too many\nthermodynamics lectures. Either way,\nthe never-ending beeping from the\nwretched Selkirk machine is\nbeginning to irritate me intensely, and\nif some act of vandalism is perpetrated\nagainst it in the next few weeks I will\nprobably be responsible.\nSabbatical Elections\nNext week is the FELIX manifesto's issue. All candidates must submit\ncopies of their manifestos by 10.00am on Monday morning, with a photo if\nthey wish to have one printed. There\nwill be no question of late\nsubmissions being included. Anyone\nwho still has not seen me about\npublicity should do so as soon as\npossible.\nCredits\n21 issues gone, 11 still to come, and\nwe still haven't finished collating\nbefore closing time. Many thanks to\na very special group of people; David\nBurns, especially for cleaning the\noffice\u2014a man after my own heart,\nKamala Sen, Francis Miers, Charles\nRobin, Andy Bannister, Chris\nMartin, Pippa Salmon, Neil\nMotteram, Mark Cottle, Judith\nHackney, Chris Edwards, David\nWilliams, Liz Holford, Helena, Chas\nJackson, Grenville Manuel, Sundi,\nSunny Bains, Steve Kilmurray, Bill\nGoodwin, Rachel Black, Al Birch,\nNigel Whitfield, Gail Turner, Jane\nSpiegel, Pete Wilson, Christine Taig,\nDrain, Hamster, Rose Atkins and\nSteve Shackell.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nHyde Park revisited\nOnly six IC students took part in yesterday's march protesting\nagainst the proposed 50% ULU cuts. About 250 in all marched\nfrom ULU in Malet Street to the offices of the University Grants\nCommission (UGC).\nThe march began at midday\nyesterday, when the protestors were\naddressed by representatives of ULU,\nthe Association of University\nTeachers (AUT) and NUS National\nPresident Vicky Phillips. They then\nset off stopping traffic on Tottenham\nCourt Road and Euston Road on the\nway.\nOnce at the UGC. ULU President\nJane Cannon personally presented a petition of 12.500 signatures\nprotesting about the cuts, while the\ndemonstrators chanted outside in the\nrain.\nRepresenting Imperial was IC\nUnion Hon Sec Dave Collev. who\ncommented afterwards that \"they\ndidn't know any good songs.\"\nNUS inaction\nThe National Union of Students held\na demonstration on Saturday against\nfalling student grants, student loans\nand the Tory government's education\npolicy. The demonstration, which\nwas held in Hyde Park, attracted\nbetween twenty and twenty five\nthousand students from colleges\naround the country. NUS president\nVicky Phillips told FELIX that this\nwas the first stage of a long battle. She\nadded \"6.2 million students, who the\ngovernment have upset and ignored,\nwill be voting for the first time. For\nevery one person on the de most ration hundreds could not afford to attend,\nbut if the government dare to\nintroduce student loans then we will\nall fight together.\"\nICU president Christine Taig, when\nasked about the demonstration said\nshe thought the NUS was naive. She\nwas too busy to go on the\ndemonstration, but when asked said\nshe was not impressed with Vicky\nPhillips' comments on radio and\ntelevision. She advised all students\nconcerned about grants and loans to\nvote for the Labour candidates in the\nforthcoming general election.\nMr Politician\nBeam me up Scottie\n\"It's democracy they're afraid of\"\naccording to Mr Tony Benn MP. who\nspoke to a packed Great Hall on\nMonday. Mr Benn addressed nearly\n400 students, at a meeting organised\nby IC Socialist Society.\nThe theme of Mr Benn's talk was\nwas that Capitalism has its power base\nin the Press and financial institutions.\nHe said that the media divided society\nby setting up groups against each\nother, citing those in work and the\nunemployed, black and white, and\nCatholic and Protestant as examples.\n\"We need\", he said, \"something as\nstrong as Capitalism\" in order to\nrebuild anything worth living for in\nBritain. Just as Capitalism has power\noutside Parliament, he added, the\npower of Socialism must be outside\nthe Labour party. The Labour party's problems, he continued, had been\ncaused by forgetting that democracy\n\"is not what someone else does on\nour behalf\".\nMuch of the questioning directed at\nMr Benn was devoted to the subject\nof defence. Emphasising that his\nviews were di similar to Labour Party\npolicy, he continued that he envisaged\na non-nuclear Britain, and a consequent withdrawal from NATO,\nbrought about by US pressure.\nBritain's ultimate fate, he believed,\nwas to become a leading light\namongst the non-aligned states.\nMr Benn went on to say that the\nUnited States was now an imperialist\nstate, mirroring the British Empire he\nhad grown up in. Its attempts at\ndes tabi lising the Soviet Union through\narms supplies to Islamic\nfundamentalists in Iran and\nAfghanistan were, he said,\n\"extremely dangerous\".\nWhen it was pointed out that a Soviet invasion had sparked off the\nwar in Afghanistan, he retorted that\nBritain had invaded Afghanistan at\nleast four times last century.\nRose\nromps\nhome\nAlan Rose of DOC will be next year's ICU Deputy President. Mr Rose was\nthe only candidate standing for the\npost when papers came down at\n5.30pm on Wednesday, and has been\nreturned unopposed. There are two\ncandidates contesting each of the\nother posts. Bill Goodwin and Ian\nHowgate are standing for ICU\nPresident and Symon Corns and Chas\nJackson are standing for ICU Hon\nSec. The two candidates for FELIX\nEditor are Chris Edwards and Judith\nHackney. The ICU Hustings UGM\nwill be next Thursday at 1.00pm in\nthe Great Hall. Voting takes place on\nMonday March 9th and Tuesday\nMarch 10th. There will be ballot\nboxes in all departments. A special\nmanifesto's issue of FELIX will be\npublished next Friday, and there will\nbe a results FELIX on Wednesday\nMarch 11th. Weeks\ngive way\nThe Weeks Hall rent strike has been\naverted. A resident's meeting on\nWednesday was told by Student\nAccommodation Officer Lesley\nGillingham that all the residents\ndemands had been acceded to.\nThe meeting was told that all\nresidents would be given an \u00a38 rebate\nfor the two weeks the hall was without\nheat and water, and that the repairs\nwhich had been demanded would be\ncarried out immediately. The heating\nsystem will be renovated over the\nsummer, five years overdue, and the\nkitchens would be upgraded, the\ndetails depending on demand for\nrooms next year.\nDave Colley. ICU Hon Sec. said\nthat a Union holding account was\nready in case of a rent strike as had\nbeen the case in 1974. A vote decided\nto cancel the rent strike, 39 to 0 with\ntwo abstentions.\nFree Friday February 27th1987 No. 765\n\n"

Two fire engines with a mobile fire control unit were followed\nround to the rear of the RSM by two\nambulances and a police van. The\nservices were called when an\nautoclave in the building exploded,\ncausing a quantity of hydrochloric\nacid to be released. Two firemen\ndressed in protective clothing and\nmasks to ward off fumes entered the\nbuilding, only to be told by RSM staff\nthat the situation was under control,\nand that no further help was required.\nA spokesman told FELIX that the\nspillage had not been particularly\nserious, and that it had not been\nthought necessary to sound alarms in\nthe building.\nCardiff\ncrisis\nThe financial crisis at University\nCollege Cardiff (UCC) has been\ndeepening for the past few years.

This situation has arisen\npartly because of the recent UGC\npolicy which allocates money more\non the basis of student numbers than\nthe size and quality of research\nprograms. Provincial universities,\nwhich are spread out and so have\nmore duplication than city\nuniversities, do particularly badly\nunder the new system and UCC has\nbeen hit hard.\nUnfortunately, the Government\nunder funding has been exacerbated by\nthe principal, Dr. Cecil Bevan, whose\nmanagement has been criticised. The\nUCC branch of the AUT, nonprofessional staff and the College\nSenate have all passed votes of no\nconfidence in Dr. Bevan who is due\nto retire next year.\nSince the Price Waterhouse report\nUCC has been asked to present\nfinancial and academic plans. These\nhave cited freezes on new staff and\nlibrary books and possible\nredundancies as ways of saving\nmoney.

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday February 27th19879 Environmental week at Imperial College starts on Monday. In the third of a series of articles in FELIX we present a survey of\" alternative\" sources of energy.\nWhen the word 'energy' is mentioned\nto you, any of a multitude of concepts\nmay spring to mind. If you are a physicist, perhaps you immediately\nthink 'mc2'; if you are a life\nscientist, you may think of\nphotosynthesis, carbohydrates and the\nKrebs cycle; electrical engineers\nmight go for kilowatt-hours, power\nstations and transmission lines,\nwhereas mining students, at the sharp\nend of the energy supply chain, will\nprobably think of energy in terms of\ncoal, oil, gas or possibly even\nuranium.\nI mention all these possibilities\nsimply to show that the work of\nalmost everyone at Imperial involves\nenergy in one or more of its\nconceptual or physical forms. But\nperhaps none of these ideas is the first\nto enter your consciousness. If your\nfeet are firmly planted on the ground\nand not halfway up the ivory tower\nof scientific esotericism, the mention\nof energy to you might conjure up\nthoughts of that quarterly panic when\nthe gas or electricity bill land on your\ndoormat at the same time as the letter\nfrom your bank manager. If this is the\ncase, then you are probably more\naware of the relevance of the energy\nquestion to an average citizen than\nany of those whose minds run on the\ntracks of their chosen subject. Energy\nis money: it is one of the four inputs\nwhich govern all economic activity\n(the others are labour, capital and raw\nmaterials). To an economist, the value\nof a potential energy source lies in its\nability to minimise costs.\nWhat of the future?\nSo far, so good. But there is a great\ndanger in assuming that a conventional economic analysis will\nalways provide the 'right' answer as\nto which source of energy is best for\nsociety. The reason for this can be\nsummed up in two words: future\nuncertainty. To those without a crystal ball, factors such as the price\nof oil and future electricity demand\ncan, when projected into the future,\nat best only have probabilities\nassigned to them. And there are other\nunknowns: public opinion in the wake\nof nuclear accidents such as occurred\nat Chernobyl; changes in the\ngovernment and resulting shifts in\nenergy strategy: future advances in\ntechnology; the state of the world\neconomy\u2014the list is endless. All this\nmakes the job of predicting the future\npatterns of energy supply and demand\na particularly difficult and somewhat\nsubjective task.\nA topical example illustrates the\nproblems involved. Those who have\ntaken an interest in the Sizewell\nnuclear power station inquiry will\nknow that the report, published a few\nweeks ago, expresses the economic\nattractiveness of the press uri sed water\nreactor (PWR) as a probability: there\nis a one in 20 chance of a coal-fired\npower station being cheaper.\nHowever, in the two years between\nthe end of the inquiry and publication\nof the report, coal prices have risen\nby a much smaller amount than was\nAlternative Energy predicted. As a result, a coal-fired\npower station looks considerably\nmore attractive economically and may\nwell be cheaper than the PWR. In\naddition, the accident at Chernobyl\nhas had a major effect on public\nopinion, with a majority now being\nopposed to any expansion in the\nnuclear programme; the government\nmay do its best to convince the\nelectorate that nuclear power is safe,\nbut it ignores people's doubts at its\nperil. Even if the government decides\nto go ahead with the project, its\ncompletion is far from certain since\nthe Labour Party is committed to\nreversing this decision if it comes to\npower.\nBeyond economics\nThe problem of uncertainty is\npresent whatever one's priorities, but\na further difficulty presents itself\nwhen we look further than the\neconomist's balance sheet\u2014\nconventional economics takes little or\nno account of the effect of energy\nsupply and use on the environment.\nIt is easy to see why: how does one\nput a price on pollution of the\natmosphere, possible hazards from\nnuclear waste, visual impact, acid\nrain, and all the other ways in which\nenergy conversion impinges on our\nsurroundings? Such social costs are\nlabelled 'external i ties' by economists:\nin other words, they are external to\nthe price system which governs the\nallocation of resources, and therefore\ncannot be incorporated easily into an\neconomic analysis. Several methods\nof dealing with external i ties have been\nproposed but they are rarely used in\npractice. The net effect is that the\ncosts attached to environmentally\ndamaging technologies do not reflect\ntheir true social costs. If they did, the\nmore environmentally benign\n'renewable' energy sources\u2014wind,\nhydro-power, sun, tides, waves\u2014\nwould be seen in a much more\nfavourable light, as would energy\nconservation measures. Indeed,\nconservation is the most\nenvironmentally sound as well as the\nmost practical approach, since we can\nall help in the elimination of waste.\nThis is the background against\nwhich the value of renewable energy\nand conservation of energy should be\nassessed. We will now go on to\nconsider some of the technologies\ninvolved, indicating the progress that\nhas been made so far and what the\nfuture may bring.\nWIND POWER\nThe UK may be deficient in\nsunlight, but it does not lack wind.\nFor this reason, wind power may well\nbe the most attractive of the renewable\nenergy technologies, a point which is\nborne out by the number of wind\nturbine generators that already exist.\nThis year, a3 megawatt (MW) wind\nturbine will be completed on the\nOrkney Islands, where two smaller\nturbines already exist. The CEGB is\nplanning to build a1 MW turbine at\na less windy site in Kent. A number\nof smaller machines exist around the\ncountry, particularly on remote and\nwindy island sites, and many more are\nin use abroad, particularly in\nDenmark and the USA.\nThe British Wind Energy\nAssociation has calculated that, in\nlarge numbers on good sites, wind\nturbines could produce electricity at\naround 2p/ kWh (compared with\n2.9p/ kWh for Sizewell B). Most\nexisting wind turbines are of the\nhorizontal axis type, like traditional\nwindmills (though their appearance is\nsomewhat more high-tech!) but there\nis a body of thought which believes\nthat a vertical axis would be more\nappropriate since the machine does\nnot need to be rotated to face the wind\nand because the generating e qui ment can be located at the base of the\ntower, thus reducing costs and\nmaking maintenance easier. A160 kW prototype has already been installed\nat Carmarthen; this design is\nultimately intended to be used in a full-scale offshore machine. This is\nimportant, since there may be\nobjections to siting large numbers of\nmachines on exposed sites on land;\noffshore, this problem does not exist,\nalthough the cost is inevitably higher.\nThe size of the offshore wind resource\nis immense: one estimate suggests that\neven allowing for shipping lanes and\nthe like, offshore turbines could\nproduce an amount of electricity\nequivalent to over half the UK's current consumption. Since the\nfluctuating output from wind turbines\nrestricts their potential contribution to\naround 20% of our electricity needs,\nthe resource is clearly not a limiting\nfactor.\nMuch remains to be done to\nestablish suitable sites for wind\nturbines, to improve their reliability\nand reduce their unit costs. But there\nis little doubt that large wind turbines\ncould play a major role in a future\nelectricity supply system, and with\nlittle or no environmental damage.\nWAVE POWER\nHere are some of the facts on wave\npower:\n\u2022 The coastal waters of the UK have\naverage wave powers which are\namong the highest in the world.\n\u2022 A CEGB analysis has put the\nfeasible contribution of wave energy\nto the national supply at around\n10GW \u2014about 'A of total demand.\n\u2022 The fuel costs nothing and is\nnon-polluting.\n\u2022 Dept. of Energy studies have\nconcluded that full scale devices\nwould produce \"no major deleterious\nenvironmental effects.\"\n\u2022 Norway has 2 fully operational\nwave power devices delivering\nelectricity to a local grid at an\nestimated cost of 2.5p per Kwh.\nHowever, in 1985 the UK\nGovernment abandoned all research\non wave power. Ignoring Norway's results, the estimated costs for wave\nenergy have fallen in the last ten years\nfrom around 50p per kwh to below\nlOp per kwh. This fact together with\nsavings from continued design\nimprovement would seem to suggest\nthat wave energy would soon be\neconomic. But despite spending over\nten years, less than a quarter of what\nwas spent on the Sizewell case alone,\nall the UK has is a \u00a32m report\nrejecting wave power whilst the\nNorwegians benefit from cheap\nelectricity from 2 machines costing\n\u00a3lm.\nSEVERN BARRAGE\nBoon or burden? Although severely\ncriticised for how it may alter the\nexisting ecological balance in the\nSevern Estuary, the Severn Barrage\nmay offer the most practical,\ninnovative and clean approach to\nelectricity generation this century.\nBased on the concept of tidal power,\nthe Barrage would cross the Severn\nEstuary between Cardiff and WestonSuper- Mare, providing electricity by\nthe power of the tides driving turbines\nin huge concrete cass ions. Other\nadvantages include a new road\nbetween Wales and England, creation\nof huge employment, a permanent\nwatersports haven and absolutely no\npollution. The only disadvantage\nwould be that a few mud-nesting\nspecies would bow to Darwinian\nselection. In short, a fantastic\nprospect for the CEGB and the British\nwind surfer! SOLAR\nPHOTOELECTRICS\nThe photoelectric effect (the direct\nconversion of light into electricity)\nhas been known since the middle of\nthe nineteenth century, but practical\nsolar cells weren't developed until the\n1950's. when expensive so leni um cells were used on early US satellites.\nAlthough the photoelectric effect\noccurs in many materials, only a small proportion of incident solar\nenergy is converted to electricity.\nMost solar cells today are made from\nsilicon, having a conversion\nefficiency of around 10%, which\nmeans large arrays of cells are needed\nfor significant power generation\u201410\nsquare feet is needed to power one\n100-watt light bulb!\nDespite this, solar cells offer\nperhaps the greatest potential for\nworldwide application of all the\nrenewable energy systems. Countries\nstill developing electricity supplies\ncould avoid all the para ph en alia of\nlarge power stations, transmission\nnetworks, transformers and the rest\nby installing clusters of solar cells\nsupplying power to towns and villages\nas and when needed.\nThe biggest 'catch' is cost: at\npresent solar energy is around ten\ntimes as expensive as nuclear, but\nsuch statistics can be misleading as\nthey preclude distribution costs and\nenvironmental considerations. The\ninevitability of sunlight necessitates\ninstantly available alternative\ngenerators or adequate storage\ncapacity: either adds further to the\ncost; as does the need for d.c. to a.c. inversion. However, the problems are\nnot un surmountable: intensive\nresearch efforts to find new cell\nmaterials and methods of production\nare steadily bringing down costs, so\nthat photo elect i city is expected to\nbecome competitive with\nconventional power generation by the\nturn of the century. In the UK solar\nenergy is com pet i vie in only remote\nlow power applications at present,\nsuch as navigation beacons, but even\nhere large scale generation should\nbecome a serious option in 10 to 15\nyears time.\nOnce installed it is the simplest\npower supply known. It is very\nreliable, needs no maintenance or\nchemical inputs, and may well outlive\nus all (and today's nuclear power\nplants!)\nPASSIVE SOLAR HEATING\nSolar power is a well known\nalternative source of energy, be it for\nsmall scale water heating or electricity\ngeneration. Passive solar heating has,\nup to now, remained the Cinderella\nof solar circles, which is a pity as it\nreally works. Passive solar heating\nwill heat your room by harnessing the\nsun's light as i> streams in through\nyour South facing window. To make\nit more effective these windows\nwould be made larger and 'thermal\nmass' within the room would store the\nheat which is later given off during\ndarkness. Everyone enjoys a sunny\nroom, this method allows it to pay for\nitself! As there are no moving parts\nthere is no maintenance, nor\npollution, nor any kind of waste\nproduct. Costs are extremely low.\nPassive solar heating can pay for itself\nin a couple of years, even in our\nclimate, as a coherent package can\nreduce fuel bills by 50%. Fuel savings\nof this magnitude mean that if each\nnew home were built incorporating\npassive solar heating our need for\npower stations in the future would be\ngreatly reduced. How does 2 less\nnuclear power stations sound? Passive\nsolar heating is so good the\ngovernment has financially backed its\ndevelopment. All that is now needed\nis for you architects and civil\nengineers to make use of it.\nCONCLUSION\nIt should be clear from the above\nparagraphs that renewable energy\nsources are not 'noddy' technologies.\nThey have been described as 'soft',\nbut this refers to their effect on the\nenvironment rather than the nature of\nthe engineering involved. What can\nbe said with considerable justification\nis that renewables are chronically\nunder ft in ded in the UK: in 1985\u201486,\nthe government spent over \u00a3 170m on\nnuclear power R&D, but only \u00a315m on renewables. Since much of this\nmoney goes towards making the\ntechnology economically attractive, it\ncan hardly be argued that renewables\nare being considered on equal terms.\nA vicious circle is in operation: the\nless is spent on renewables relative to\nnuclear power, the less attractive\neconomically they seem; and the less\nattractive they seem, the less is spent\non them. One can only hope that a combination of environmental and\neconomic enlightenment will enable\nthe circle to be broken and the country\nset on the path of a sustainable, 'soft'\nenergy future.\nENVIRONMENTAL WEEK\nFinally, the most important bit.\nNext/this week (2nd \u20146th March) is\nImperial College Environmental\nWeek. This is your chance to learn\nmore, not just about renewable\nenergy (though there will be displays\naround the College on this theme) but\nalso on the whole range of\nenvironmental issues. The aim is to\nincrease your awareness of man's impact on the planet and what can be\ndone to improve the situation\u2014after\nall, many students at Imperial will end\nup in positions where their decisions\nhave a major bearing on the\nenvironment.\nEvents include:\nMONDAY:\nA debate between Kenneth Carlisle,\nMP (Con) and Chris Smith, MP (Lab)\n12.45pm Mech.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday February 27th19877 resistance and then to the fascists. As\nhe investigates, he uncovers the\nelaborate plot of the fascists in which\na drug, Ephemerol, (standing for\nThalidomide?) is being clandestinely\nmanufactured and given to pregnant\nwomen to produce scanner offspring.\nIt is only at the end of the film that\nVale discovers that the leader of the\nfascists is his brother. Their father\nwas the pharmacologist who first\ndeveloped Ephemerol as a pain killer\nfor pregnant women, and tested the\ndrug on his own wife.\nCronenberg artfully exploits the\nparanoia that is associated with\nobscure, faceless security\norganisations and pharmaceutical\nresearch. It also touches on another\nidea\u2014invasion of the privacy of the\nmind.\nVideodrome is undoubtedly what\nmade Cronenberg notorious with the\npress, public and censors alike.\nExplicit imagery runs rampant, burnt\ninto the viewer's memory, unlikely to\nbe ever forgotten; but then, that's the\npoint of what Cronenberg always tries\nto do. Videodrome is a TV channel\nwhich seems to be broadcasting live,\nnon-stop torture, all set in a single\nroom. A TV station controller, Max\nRenn (played by James Woods)\nmanages to pirate some of what\nVideodrome has to offer, and eagerly\nwatches it. But he begins to suffer\nhallucinations, and, on investigating,\ndi covers that he was deliberately fed\nVideodrome as an experiment. An\nadditional signal is sent out under the\nnormal TV signal, inducing brain\ntumors in the viewer. The result is\nhallucinations, the tone of which are\ninfluenced by whatever the original\nprogramme was.\nCronenberg is cautioning us that no\nmatter how we try to guard against\nit, what we see on television is\nincreasingly becoming the source of\nraw experience upon which we draw\nin life. The film is his statement on\nhis concern with the way we\nunthinkingly watch television,\naccepting it into our lives without ever\nconsidering its effect upon us.\nAfter Videodrome and the swiftly\nfollowing censorship rows\nCronenberg went on to prove that he\ncan make a film without the gore and\nsplatter that his name has become\nvirtually syn on omo us with. The Dead\nZone, his highly acclaimed film\nversion of Stephen King's novel of the\nsame name, has the most sympathetic\ncharacter of any Cronenberg film\n(along with The Fly). The leading\ncharacters of Cronenberg's other\nfilms are hardly heroes. At best, his\ncharacters can be termed 'victims'\u2014\nbut very seldom heroes. In The Dead\nZone we have Johnny Smith\n(brilliantly played by Christopher\nWalken). a young man who suffers\na car accident and emerges from his\ncoma some years later with the ability\nto discern the past and future of an\nobject or person he happens to touch.\nHe discovers that the girl he loved\nbefore the accident has married\nsomeone else, but nevertheless\nmanages to settle down to a reasonably happy life with his father.\nHe solves a murder mystery, saves a boy's life by preventing him from\ngoing skating on some thin ice at a local lake and so on. But one day he\nshakes hands with a junior politician,\nand sees him in the future as the\nPresident of the United States, insane,\nstarting World War III. Johnny Smith\ncannot avoid his destiny, no matter\nhow he agonizes over whether or not\nhe is actually doing the world any\ngood.\nProbably the most public aspect of\nCronenberg's career is his running\nbattle with the censors of various\nnations. In England we have seen\nsuch phenomena as legal actions\n(admittedly unsuccessful) to prevent\nthe retail distribution of such films as\nThe Evil Dead. But we can look to\nCanada to see what real censorship\nimplies. The Canadian public have\nbeen unable to see the full,\nunabridged version of Not a Love\nStory. Vie Brood, featured in a Toronto Film Festival, had the 'birth'\nscene, crucial to the exposition of the\nfilm, cut.\nVideodrome. which won\nCronenberg the 'Best Direction'\naward at the Genies (the Canadian\nOscars) has been cut both here in\nGreat Britain and in America. In\nBritain, its video release was\nindefinitely postponed, even though\nit had already suffered three extensive\ncuts.\nCronenberg's response to the issue\nof censorship is one of deep\nconviction. As a film maker, he can\nonly wish for his films to be seen\u2014\nno matter how censored they are.\nMary Brown, former head of the\nToronto Censor Board, is firmly set\nagainst what she sees as 'the virulent\nCronenberg epidemic' According to\nher research, people are more\nconcerned with what they would want\nto stop their neighbour from being\nable to see, rather than themselves.\nIn an interview Cronenberg\ncommented: \"The virus is only trying\nto live its life, just doing its job. In\nfact I think most diseases would be\nshocked to be considered diseases. It\nhas a very negative connotation, For\nthem, it's very positive when they\ntake over your body and destroy you.\nIt's a triumph.\"\nWhilst Cronenberg may be on\nsound ground when he advocates the\nright of the individual to see\nsomething for him or herself, he does\nseem to skate across thin ice when he\nsays; \"As an artist one is not a citizen\nof society, One is bound to explore\nevery corner of human experience.\nYou can't worry about what your\nsociety regards as good or bad\nbehaviour. The artist has no sense of\nsocial responsibility whatsoever.\"\nSeveral questions spring to mind from\nthis speech; if an artist is not a member of society then how is he\nqualified to comment on that society,\nIf the artist has no sense of social\nresponsibility, does this mean that\nCronenberg would go on TV\nparticipating in a programme like\nVideodrome? If he thought it was\nartistic would he torture people on\nlive TV? Just how far is he prepared\nto go? Cronenberg's films all deal\nwith the thesis that man has arrested\nhis own natural evolution, and will\nsoon begin to control it himself, that\nthe body will evolve on its own,\nleaving the mind behind.\nHe has been described as the\nopposite of Steven Spielberg. Films\nsuch as the Star Wars series, the\nRocky series, ET, all tell us that we\nshouldn't change modern society\u2014it\nis fine as it is. We will win out in the\nend. Cronenberg says that we\nshouldn't change society because if\nwe tried we would only make it\nworse.\nPerhaps what Cronenberg really\nstrives for in his films is best summed\nup by his own words.\n\"We have created our own\nUniverse. And therefore what's wrong with it also comes from within\nus. We carry around the seeds of our\nown destruction within g us. For me\nthe imagery of The Creaturefrom the\nBlack Lagoon was always perfect\nbecause the Black Lagoon is the dark\npool of the unc on cio us and of course\nthere are creatures within it. The\nexercise is to jump down into the\nLagoon to see what is going on down\nthere and to say 'hello' to the\ncreature.\"\n\n"
