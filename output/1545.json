    "content": "Need to clear your head?\nPhilippa Skett on the new imaging technique that is sweaping labs nationwide\nD\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe slimy world of Hagfish Haute Couture\nScience Writer\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\n10\nwww.nature.com/news/see-through-brains-clarify-connections-1.12768\no you ever \ufb01nd yourself walking along the\nstreet, daydreaming\naway, and then suddenly wonder what if\npeople around you could hear what\nyou were thinking? What if complete\nstrangers could see into your head,\nlisten to your thoughts and leave no\nstone of your conscience unturned?\nWith the recent advances in tissue im-aging, your brain can now be as transparent as a gold \ufb01sh bowl, but relax-your secrets will still remain safe for\nthe foreseeable future.\nA new technique developed by a\nteam in Stanford University in America, known as CLARITY, holds the\nkey to giving us the clearest insight\nyet into the structure of the brain. It is\ncentred on the application of a detergent known as SDS to tissue to make\nboth transparent and chemically per-meable. SDS removes lipid molecules\nthat usually make tissue opaque by\nstopping light passing through, leaving tissues clearer than ever seen before and ready for further treatment.\nWith previous attempts at stripping away lipid molecules resulting in\nprotein damage, CLARITY smoothly\novercame this by also infusing the tissue with acrylamide, the same plastic\nused to make false nails. The acryla-mide is heated and is transformed into\na type of brain sca\ufb00olding, holding\nall the important proteins and other\nbiomolecules in place as the lipids are\nthen stripped away.\nThis leaves an immaculately transparent organ, which can be stained\nor treated with molecular markers\nto show di\ufb00erent cell types and their\nfunctions. Whole signalling pathways\ncan be visually mapped \u2013 useful for\nidentifying possible structural causes\nfor neurological malfunctions.\nCLARITY is not suitable for living\ntissue but for deceased samples, and\nwill be useful for preserving delicate\nspecimens such as organs su\ufb00ering\nfrom rare or particularly damaging\ndiseases. Whole libraries of preserved\nbrains could be made to display various progressions of neurodevelop-ment or model rare or incurable\ndiseases. Instead of books you could\nborrow these transparent brains,\nstudy them then bring them back. As\ngrisly as that may sound, it could in\ufb01nitely aid neurological research and\nbring us one step closer to \ufb01guring out\ncrucial cures for disorders.\nThe brain has always been a mystery to humans both biologically and\nphilosophically \u2013 although it was\nDescartes who identi\ufb01ed thought as\nsynonymous with existence with his\nfamous quote \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d\nlittle else has been agreed on since.\nThe translation between experience,\nmemory storage, and recall is still\nnot understood; computers may code\ntheir memory in binary digits but the\nbrain\u2019s coding of our thoughts is still\na mystery. Until this crucial code is\ncracked, even the most intricate map\nof our mind on a cellular level will still\nnot reveal those secrets we don\u2019t want\nto share. We may be able to see the circuit board, but we will still be unable\nto decipher the \ufb01les.\nSo unless the blueprint of our brain\ncan be fully understood and not just\nmapped in a whirl of rainbow colours,\nthose daydreams will still remain\nyours. Strangers in the street need not\never know just what you are think-ing, unless you are inclined to go up\nto them and tell them so yourself. No\namount of transparent tissue is going to change that \u2013 at least, not for\na while yet.\nDOI :10.1038/496151a\nClothes are important to anyone;\nwhether you\u2019re an avid fashionista or\nmore of the practical sort, we all need\nclothes. However, the materials making up our clothes may be straying\nfrom the ordinary to the extraordinary\nin the not so distant future. The new\nsource of the fabric for your brand\nnew dress or coat could be swimming\nat the deep, dark depths of our ocean\n\ufb02oor.\nThe majority of the fabrics we rely\non today are oil-based polymers,\nwhich basically means that the materials are petroleum based. With our\never decreasing supplies of petroleum\nthe demand for alternatives to these\nproducts is high... enter the hag\ufb01sh.\nResearch led by Atsuko Negishi at\nthe University of Guelph in Canada\nhas suggested that hag\ufb01sh slime could\nbe used to create a super stretchy, ly-cra-like fabric.\nThe team managed to collect this\nslime from the hag\ufb01sh and realised\nthat it could be treated and then spun\ninto threads much like silk.\nThis does seem a bit odd and grue-some, but it really is very logical to put\nthese materials that nature provides to\ngood use.\nHag\ufb01sh are ancient, bottom-dwell-Lucy Hagger\ning animals that have been around for\nover 300 million years. If you\u2019ve done\nsome evolutionary biology in your\ntime, you should de\ufb01nitely remember these weird and slimey creatures.\nIt has been known for some time that\nwhen these strange, eel-like animals\nare approached or attacked they release copious amounts of sticky slime\nas a deterrent.\nThe slime contains mucous and\nhuge amounts of certain protein \ufb01bers\nbelonging to the family intermediate\n\ufb01laments. These \ufb01laments are great\nfor making fabrics as they can be deformed and stretched to shapes and\nsizes very di\ufb00erent to their original\nform.\nBut don\u2019t go rushing out to the nearest high street for the latest fashion in\nhag\ufb01sh slime. The researchers aren\u2019t\nquite ready to produce full on items\nof clothing, but they intend to pursue\nthis concept further to hopefully create the basis for more environmentally\nfriendly fabrics of the future.\nImages taken of neurons within the brain\nusing the CLARITY technique\nWould you trust a robot to operate on\nyour brain? Why not? Robotic neurosurgery can provide a less painful, less\ndangerous and less invasive alternative to traditional open methods.\nUnder the guidance of Professor\nLord Darzi and Professor Yang at the\nHamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery\nhere at Imperial College London, academics are pioneering a truly revolutionary approach to neurosurgery using keyhole techniques.\nKeyhole surgery is performed\nthrough unconventionally small incisions using a light source, a camera\nand a television monitor and is at\nthe moment used to carry out surgical procedures in the abdomen or the\npelvis.\nHowever, Imperial academics have\nrecognised the potential for this concept to be applied to the brain, and are\nin the midst of developing a robotic\nplatform for keyhole neurosurgery.\nThis approach is extremely promising,\nwith advantages including reducing\nthe length of the incision, reducing\nthe size of the bone \ufb02ap and reducing\nexposure and manipulation of healthy\nbrain tissue.\nThe ultimate goal of the robotic\nplatform is to \u201cintegrate advances in\nendoscopy, image guidance and articulated instruments to enhance the\nfeasibility, safety and e\ufb00ectiveness of\noperations\u201d, says Hani Marcus, a Clinical Fellow in the Hamlyn Centre.\nThe use of robots to perform surgery has its roots in the use of a modi\ufb01ed Puma 560 industrial robot in 1985\nto guide a brain biopsy.\nMore recently the da Vinci robot, a\ntelesurgical system whereby the surgeon remotely controls the robots ac-tions, has allowed surgeons to perform\noperations that were previously considered too di\ufb03cult to safely perform\nthrough keyhole approaches, such as\nthe treatment of prostate cancer.\nOther developments include the i-snake, a snake-like device which can\nwiggle its way through to inaccessible\nareas and Acrobot's robot for hip replacement surgery.\nDr Brittain of the UK Medicines and\nHealthcare Products Regulatory Authority says \"it is inevitable that within\nthe next 10 years, we won't be putting\nthe surgeons hand in a patient\u2019s body\nanymore.\" Are intelligent robotics really the future for surgery?\nIntelligent Robots to take\nover the operating theatre?\nScience Writer\nSophie Shina\nhttp://bouncingideas.wordpress.com\nAlternatively, you could just\nwear this guy as a scarf\n\n"

And\nwe fear that it\u2019s not due to end up in a\nhappy place any time soon. As is the\ncase with many science-\ufb01ction \ufb01lms,\nhumans don\u2019t exactly fare well, in the\nbeginning at least, and the mention of\n\u201cmemory-wipe\u201d further complicates\nthings and puts a darker spin on an already ambiguous set-up.\nEven though Joseph Kosinski\u2019s\n$120-million sci-\ufb01 blockbuster looks\nlike your typical post-apocalyptic,\nbig-budget shambles, there is a much\nmore potent underlying background\nstory that is happening to Cruise\u2019s Jack.\nWhat he thinks he knows, his dreams,\nhis memories, are all jumbled in his\nhead, as he is frequently plagued by\nvisions of a woman (Kurylenko) who\nis not his partner. Jack has been left\nbehind with Vicki (Riseborough), and\nthe two are tasked with overseeing the\n\ufb01nal few operations left on Earth before they can safely escape to Titan, the\nlargest moon of Saturn.\nBut just why is he unsure of all the\ncommands that is being given to him\nby the creepy Sally (Leo)? Why does\nVicki fail to share in his curiosity?\nWhere are these supposed \u201cScavs\u201d who\ndestroyed humanity? And just who is\nthis woman he\u2019s seeing in front of the\nEmpire State Building? Plus why is he\nbeing followed by someone wearing\nwhat can only be described as a Darth\nVader suit?\nAll legitimate questions, all of them\nproperly addressed to, but not without Kosinski taking his time in taking\nus through the harsh, barren lands of\nwhat once was our planet. It\u2019s beautiful\nyet unsettling at the same time, as the\nsweeping cinematography wonderfully\ncaptures all the details in many single\nlong takes.\nThe cast all do an excellent job in\nbringing to life the deep imbeded love\nstory that is wrapped around all the\nsci-\ufb01 madness. Headlining the whole\nproject, Cruise is as usual a reliable\nlead with a touch of instability and curiosity to make his character work. Of\nthe two women, the one faring better is\nRiseborough, who ends up as a tragic\nheroine in this twisted tale and it\u2019s her\nhighly e\ufb00ective cold, steel-like quality that brings out the overall sadness\nin the narrative. And once again Leo\nproves she only has to open her mouth\nto send chills down our spine. \u201cHow are\nyou all doing this beautiful morning?\u201d\n\u201cAre you an e\ufb00ective team?\u201d both seem\nlike harmless greeting questions, but\nwith Leo\u2019s delivery, you can instantly\ntell there is something a lot more sinister happening. And it\u2019s always good to\nsee Morgan Freeman pop up in a \ufb01lm\nto provide his voice of exposition for\nsome calm, chilled out explanation on\nwhat the hell is going on.\nA healthy portion of the production\nbudget seems to have been spent on\nbuilding the spotless sets; all cold and\nsilver on the edges, smooth and shiny\non the exterior, so perfect in a way that\nmakes us doubt the cleanliness of it all.\nFans of kinetic sci-\ufb01 action will also\nno doubt get their fair share as Jack\npilots a funny looking bubbly plane,\noften hunted by nasty drones which\nhave \ufb01erce speed, high \ufb01re-power and\npersistence.\nThe \ufb01lm\u2019s main weakness comes\nwhen it has to wrap things up. Instead\nof taking the logical route, it forces an\nawkward, senseless happy ending, one\nthat doesn\u2019t do the rest of the \ufb01lm jus-tice. With so many holes punched into\nthe plot to make the Hollywood ending \ufb01t, it undermines all the hard work\nand build-up the \ufb01lm has put together\npreviously.\nMinus the \ufb01nal 10 minutes or so,\nOblivion is an often thought-provoking\npiece, one that also makes sure everything looks perfect, as well as the right\namount of fun delivered.\n\n"

Not only that: a new liver\nhormone called betatrophin has been\ndiscovered that encourages growth of\ninsulin-secreting cells, which could\nbe manipulated for future diabetes\ntreatment development. High-\ufb01ves\nall round for the immunologists out\nthere.\nAnd lastly, we celebrated the 60th\nanniversary of the Double Helix, with\nthe original paper describing the DNA\nstructure being published in Nature\non the 25th of April, 1953. If any molecule deserves a birthday party, DNA\nis it. mRNA, the smaller, more active\nyet unloved sibling of DNA celebrates\nits birthday sometime in October,\nbut it seemed that no-one even cared\nenough to record the date properly,\nso this was probably the only biomol-ecule birthday worth watching out for\nthis year.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.04.014\nNASA have had a busy Easter breakin the past month, their probe on\nNASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft spotted a\nhurricane on Saturn two thousand\nkilometres wide, alongside capturing\nphotos for the \ufb01rst time of meteoroids crashing into Saturn\u2019s rings. A\ntop month for NASA; not so much for\nSaturn.\nTheoretical physicists got busy\nmeasuring antigravity, leaving us pondering if anti-matter atoms fall up,\nwhilst pesky pyrrole molecules were\nalso seen to be making the rules up as\nthey go along.\nThe impact of quantum laws of\nphysics has been seen to now exert\ne\ufb00ects at a molecular level, with pyr-roles moving over metal surfaces in\na manner contradictory to classical\nphysics. It was initially thought that\nzero-point energy \u2013 residual, undetectable energy in the quantum world\nthat means nothing is perfectly still \u2013\ndid not apply to whole molecules, but\npyrroles de\ufb01ed this in recent tests in\nthe Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Back to the drawing board\nguys!\nAnd \ufb01nally, someone spotted what\nlooked like a penis drawn by the Mars\nexploration rovers Spirit and Opportunity whilst looking for water on the\nred planet.\nAlthough this was claimed to be a\ncomplete accident, anyone who has\never come within a mile radius of Imperial knows that scientists never really grow up. We are all kids at heart,\njust with access to lasers, chemicals\nand the odd bio-hazardous bacterial\nstrain.\nSomewhere out there, an astrophysicist is quietly chuckling to himself, after completing the ultimate doodle in\nthis solar system.\nChemists have been taking imagery\nto a new level this Easter, with them\ndeciding that there is no such thing as\n\u201ctoo small,\u201d when it comes to viewing\nscale, if nothing else.\nX-ray single-crystal di\ufb00raction, that\nmolecular structure determination\nmethod that we all know and love, saw\na revamp at the beginning of April.\nScientists from both Japan and\nFinland established a new protocol\nfor the method to no longer require\ncrystallisation of the target molecule\nbefore analysis. Molecules can now be\nas small as 80ng for studying by this\ndi\ufb00raction method, so if you have that\nspeck you have been dying to identify\nhandy, now is your chance.\nSTAM, or Saturated Transient Absorption Microscopy, also hit the\nchemical scene towards the end of last\nmonth. This new imaging system, using three\nlaser beams, allows for\nsuper-resolution optical microscopy, and overcomes the issue of the di\ufb00raction limit that hinders\nusual light microscopy.\nImages are generated using STAM\nby comparing the contrast between\nexcited and ground state electrons in\nmolecules when excited upon illumination instead, making it possible to\nstudy nanomaterials, again if nothing\nelse, in much greater detail.\nRice University also found out this\nmonth that when squeezing the liquid\nphase of silicone, it gets surprisingly\nsti\ufb00 when repeatedly and gently com-pressed, although polymer scientist\nRafael Verduzco declined to comment\non whether or not such research was\ninspired by more intimate moments\nhe has had outside the lab.\nIn conventional silicones, polymer\nchains are usually randomly orientated that allow for a return to their\nusual state after compression. In liquid phase silicone, it was found that\nthe chains are organised in rod shaped\ncoils and are initially randomly ori-entated. Repeated compression leads\nto them rotating and pointing in the\nsame direction however, contributing\nto the sti\ufb00ness.\nWith silicone being a biocompatible\nmaterial, incorporating this new information back into the bedroom may\noccur within the foreseeable future,\nif some adventurous biologists fancy\ngetting on board too.\nI don\u2019t want to speci\ufb01cally suggest\npenis-related ideas, but if the selfsti\ufb00ening silicone glove \ufb01ts...\nDOI: 10.1038/nature11990\nDOI: 10.1038/nphoton.2013.97\nDOI: 10.1038/ncomms2772\nBiology\nPhysics\nChemistry\nDOI: 10.1002/anie.201302289\nhttp://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/04/25/penis-graffiti-discovered-on-mars/\nhttp://news.rice.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/0429_VERDUZCO-1-web.jpg\nhttp://blogs.biomedcentral.com\nOne large penis for man, one\ngiant erection for mankind\nFelix Science can confirm this is\nexactly what the inside of an implant\nlooks like\nThe high-flying H5M9 virus\n\n"

As soon as you\u2019ve\nsaved up enough money for one gadget,\nanother brand spanking new one will\ncome along and steal its \u2018must-have\u2019\ncrown.\nFrom televisions to tablets, scanners\nto speakers \u2013 with this never-ending\nstream of new technology, how is it\npossible to take advantage of the latest,\ncoolest, most innovative products on\nthe market without being in danger of\nbankrupting yourself?\nLuckily, there are ways to cut back\non how much you\u2019re spending on tech\nwithout compromising a desire for the\nvery best. Here are just a few pointers\non how to save money and have enough\nleft over to spend on those gadgets you\nreally want!\nSell your cast-offs\nIf you\u2019re guilty of keeping old phones,\ncomputers and USB sticks for the\nsake of it, then you\u2019re missing many a\nmoney-making trick! Instead of sticking them in the kitchen drawer and\nnever giving them a second thought,\nput them on eBay or even flog them\nat a boot-sale. You might not get that\nmuch money for them (naturally the\nolder they are, the less people will be\nwilling to pay) but surely it\u2019s still better than nothing? By using old technology as a way of subsidising the new,\nyou\u2019ll feel less guilty about having a\nfast turnover.\nTools like MoneySavingExpert\u2019s\nMobile Valuer can even give you an\nidea of how much your current tech is\nworth.\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\n24\nTricks of the Trade: Saving on Tech\nThe News Bubble\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date with the\nnewest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.\nCurved TV\nLG Electronics have now released the first curved OLED TV for the public to\npurchase. The fact that it costs 15 million won (\u00a38,725) which is not exactly\ncheap, and is only availabe in South Korea means that you will probably not\nbe seeing it any time soon. However when it does finally become a bit more\naffordable as well as globally available, it will promise to bring that \u2018Imax\u2019\nfeeling right to yout own living room!\nTwitter All Mighty\nRecently hackers took over the Fox News Twitter account and declared that\nObama had been assassinated. While this was (obviously) not true, the American stock market plunged after word reached investors of this bogus news.\nThe Dow soon recovered, but this just proves what a power social networks\nand unprotected accounts have accumulated.\nFirst Web Page\nCern is recreating the first ever web page to celebrate the 20th birthday of\nthe internet. The aim is to allow younger generations an insight into the plat-tform that now dominates their life.\nThe Instagram Act\nThe goverment is now considering the Instagram Act. This legislation, which\nmakes new provisions on orphan works (works where the authors cannot\nbe easily identified), easing their licensing and allowing companies easier\naccess for their use. This is not a big step away from online pictures as well,\nand, as they do fall under the orphan work category, they may be used by\nanyone. Thus anyone who is heavily involved in social networks, uploading pictures on a regular basis should be warned. You may be seeing these\npictures more often than you like.\nFacebook Home\nFacebook has released a modified Facebook \u201cwrap-around\u201d for Android,\nwhich basically creates a Facebook OS. Your Facebook notifactions, messages etc. are directly on your phone and as such Facebook will always be\nopen for you to use and peruse. However some have wondered at the privacy\n(as always with Facebook), as it seems that Home sends data to Facebook at\nall times about non-relevant things. Only install if you are a Facebook Junkie\nand don\u2019t care about your privacy!\nTweeting From your Glasses\nYes, Google Glass has been around for a while now, and people who won\nGoogle\u2019s contest can even test them out. Now the interweb is abound with\nrumours of a dedicated Twitter app for the shiny new gadget. This certainly is\ninteresting as well as good new for Google, as it not only implies a consumer\ninterest for Glass, but also a will to support it fr om other companies. It knows\nthat the more apps are optimized for the device the more likely its success\nwill be. However this makes those annoying pictures of food, cluttering the\ninternet, even more easy to take....sigh.\nTech Editor\nMaximilian Eggl Tech Editor\n\u201d\n\u201c\nInstead of\nsticking your\nold tech in the\nkitchen draw-er, put them\non eBay\nConsider refurbished items\nRefurbished items su\ufb00er from a terrible misconception. Instead of being\na straight-forward second-hand product (which people assume to be dam-aged, scratched and used as a result)\nthey are often restored and revamped\nto look as good as new. If you\u2019re on\nthe hunt for a new-ish product from\nbrands like Apple or Dell, it would be\nwell worth checking out their refurbs;\nyou could end up saving up to 30%\non tablets or laptops simply by going\ndown this route.\nSearch for discounts online\nIt might seem like a no brainer, but\nyou\u2019d be surprised how many people\nmiss out on a bargain by forgetting to\nlook for vouchers online. For students\nespecially, simply being at university\nis all you need to be entitled to some\nmoney o\ufb00. It\u2019s not just restaurants and\nfashion either, there are some excellent student discounts to be had on\ntechnology, so have a look at voucher\nwebsites like MyVoucherCodes to see if\nyou could save on everyday stu\ufb00 like\nbroadband rates and printer ink.\nAvoid expensive repairs\nIf your laptop or PC has fallen foul to\na virus in the past, you\u2019ll know how\nsoul destroying it can be \u2013 if it were to\nhappen again, you\u2019d probably be willing to pay the earth rather than lose\nyour entire music collection. But is it\nreally worth spending hundreds and\nhundreds of pounds on a tech-ex-pert? It\u2019s likely you won\u2019t be the only\nperson to have had the same issue, so\nwhy not look at forums and technology websites to see if you can \ufb01gure\nout a solution yourself? It might take\ntime and seem like more hassle than\nit\u2019s worth, but if it saves you a bucket\nload of cash in the process, we reckon\nit\u2019ll be time well spent.\nNow get out there!\nIf you\u2019re desperate to get your hands\non a new bit of kit, try implementing just a few of the aforementioned\nmoney saving ideas \u2013 you might be\nsurprised at how much you could\nsave, and just how much you might\nbe able to a\ufb00ord in the long run.\n\u201d\n\u201c\u201d\n\u201d\nOn the hunt\nfor a new-ish\nproduct?\nCheck out\nRefurbs!\n\n"

However with start-ups\ncurrently the talk of London town,\nthat looks set to change.\nOver the past year Google Campus has roared to life and Old Street\nroundout is now more commonly refered to as \u2018Silicon Roundabout.\u2019 And\ndespite East London getting the biggest slice of the entrprenurship cake\nat the moment, Imperial seems to be\njumping on the enterprise bandwag-gon by putting commercial innovation at the heart of the new Imperial\nWest campus. Could it be that Tech\nH\nCaroline Wood and Pedro Silva Pereira on Imperial\u2019s start-up scene\nCity sprawls from East to West in time\nfor Imperial\u2019s new campus to open in\n2016?\nLast year a group of forward thinking students at Imperial noticed this\ngrowing trend and decided to do\nsomething about it. Throughout the\nsummer break, a group of people passionate about entrepreneurship were\nhatching plans to transform the enterprise scene at Imperial.\nICStartup \u2013 a collaboration between\nImperial Entrepreneurs, Imperial Innovations and Imperial Hub \u2013 was\nformed, bringing together exper-tise, experience and passion from all\ncorners of campus. Combining the\nstudent enthusiasm of the Imperial\nEntreprenurs society, the experience,\nnetwork and resources of Imperial\nInnovations, and social enterprise\nexpertese of Imperial Hub the foundations were laid in place for student\nstart-up activities at Imperial to \ufb02ourish.\nDuring this past academic year\nICStarup has created a shared working space in the Union for students\n\u201cI\u2019m an atheist and I\u2019m interested in\nmeditation.\u201d Last year I had a number\nof conversations with people who all\nbegan with this comment. It is too\nsmall a sample from which to interpret the changing nature of atheism\nor if there is an increasing interest in\nmeditation. (And anyway all of these\ncomments may have arisen from the\nrealisation \u2018OMG, it\u2019s the vicar, quick\nwhat can I talk about?\u2019)\nBut these conversations did get me\nthinking. Meditation is part of my\nreligious experience. But I know that\nBuddhists and some Quakers practice\nmeditation but describe themselves as\natheists. I had learnt about Buddhist\nmeditation from sharing a weekly\ntime of silence at the Royal College of\nArt with a Buddhist monk. From him\nI had learnt of \u2018mindfulness\u2019. He used\nit to describe the practice of paying\nconscious attention to sensory, cognitive and emotional experience. The\ntechnique was to become aware, or\n\u2018mindful\u2019, of sensations or feelings but\nwithout getting caught up in them.\nWith all this \u2018in mind\u2019 I came across\nthe work of Jon Kabat-Zinn, Profesor of Medicine Emeritus at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat-Zinn had noticed\npositive results in clinical trials using\nmindfulness meditation with patients\nsu\ufb00ering from depression. Professor\nMark Williams, a psychiatrist at Oxford University, used this research to\ndevelop a mindfulness meditation for\nstress reduction and to improve mental wellbeing.\nThis seemed to be the kind of meditation that has an evidence base and\ndoes not require a religious belief.\nIt also promoted emotional health.\nRecent research in psychology has\ndemonstrated the two-way links between our emotions and our bodies.\nFor example, if we feel sad our bodies\nwill re\ufb02ect that sadness in the way we\nwalk and sit. Conversely, if we are not\nfeeling sad but adopt a sad, slumped,\nposture we will then very quickly start\nto feel sad.\nKabat-Zinn and others also used\nMRI scans to show that upsetting\nemotions can be seen clearly in the\nright pre-frontal cortex. Positive emotions on the other hand show up more\nclearly in the left pre-frontal cortex.\nThe ratio of electrical activity between\none side of the pre-frontal cortex gives\na picture of a person\u2019s emotional state.\nKabat-Zinn explored this in relation\nto mindfulness meditation. He taught\na group of bio-tech workers the meditation practice. After eight weeks of\nmeditation practice the participants\nbecame more energised and less\nprone to low mood. It was also found\nthat this state was maintained even\nwhen participants were reminded of\nmemories and music that were linked\nto sad personal memories. It appeared\nthat with meditation training people were able to accept the negative\npersonal memories but without being overwhelmed by them. The other\noutcome was that the participants also\ndeveloped measurably stronger immune systems.\nThis evidence based approach to\nmeditation seemed like a good response to those who wanted to learn\nmeditation but who did not want a\nreligious practice. Using Mark Williams\u2019 book as a basis the Chaplaincy\nstarted o\ufb00ering mindfulness meditation in October. Over two terms we\nhave found that this is something that\npeople \ufb01nd helpful in the realities of\ndaily life. This includes those with\nphilosophical world view (atheism,\nhumanism, materialism) and those\nwith a traditional or personal religious\nworld view.\nThe simplest way to describe mindfulness is through a simple exercise.\nRaise one arm above your head. Close\nyour eyes. Slowly lower your arm. As\nyour arm descends track the di\ufb00erent\nsensations that occur. You might be\nable to notice what you are thinking,\nor the emotions you are feeling. So\na short 3-5 minute mediation lets us\nnotice the range of our personal sen-sory, cognitive and emotional data.\nSo you might notice \u2018eyes feeling tired\nfrom a day in front a screen, niggling\nanxiety about un\ufb01nished tasks, trying\nto remember if there is anything in\nthe fridge for dinner, and an anticipation about\u2026\u2019). It is important not to\njudge the data \u2013 it is just what is being thought, sense and felt at this mo-ment. There is a positive element of\nself-acceptance that comes with prac-tice. And there is the sense of calm.\nThis is the season in the university\nfor increased stress and anxiety. Small\namounts of meditation practice can\nmake a di\ufb00erence \u2013 and by this I mean\n5-10 minutes daily. It is described as\na practice \u2013 for good reason. But it\ndoes not take long to start showing\nbene\ufb01ts.\nWhatever your worldview \u2018Mindfulness Meditation\u2019 takes place in the\nChaplaincy Centre in Beit Quad every\nTuesday 1-1:45pm. For those wanting a particular religious framework\nfor meditation we have Buddhist and\nChristian meditation each week, and\nwe can link you up with someone to\ntalk about Hindu meditation.\nOn Thursday 9th May join us for\n\u2018How to be Mindful in a Digital Age\u2019 a\ntalk by the Venerable Narayan Prasad\nRijal, a Buddhist teacher who is also\na lecturer in Physics at Tribhuvan\nUniversity, Nepal. This event is being\nhosted by students from the Buddhist\nmeditation group and by the Chaplaincy from 7-8pm in the Pippard Lecture Theatre, followed by discussion\nand refreshments. More details of all\nevents www.imperial.ac.uk/chaplain-cy\nMeditating through exam stress\nAndrew WillsonCollege Chaplain\nto work on start-up projects, put on\ntalks, run workshops, and even a\nhackathon.\nThe culmination of this collaboration led to the biggest start-up challenge that Imperial has ever held.\nWith \u00a330,000 of funding up for grabs\nand the chance to access free expert\nadvice, the competition attracted over\n200 students, sta\ufb00 and alumni wanting to turn their academic knowledge\ninto a commercial reality.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n20 FRIDAY 03 MAY\nSamuel Page Film Writer\nRobot & Frank is the \ufb01lm of an elderly,\ndeteriorating gentleman, and the Robot, a technological care assistant, given to him by his son. The \ufb01lm focuses\non the relationship between the pair, a\nmore mismatched couple it is hard to\nimagine: a cranky, lonely old man and\na blank faced, obliging machine. Frank\nLangella gives a brilliant performance\nas Frank; completely understated but\ncomplex and a\ufb00ecting. As an elderly\nman su\ufb00ering from spells of memory\nloss, the viewer is never quite sure how\nmuch of an act he is putting on, either\nto hide his illness or to play it up. The\ncharacter has a delicious penchant for\nmischief and is far from your typical\nsweet old man. His past as a cat burglar\nis \ufb01nely sketched but proves the driving force for the plot along with much\nof the humour of the \ufb01lm, which whilst\nrarely laugh-out-loud gives the \ufb01lm a\nlightness of touch that counterbalances the sadness at its heart. This is a \ufb01lm\nof dysfunctional relationships with Robot taking the position of Frank\u2019s help-er, friend, perhaps even the son that he\nmissed out on. The viewer is frequently\nasked to consider if Robot can be considered as a friend: can he be viewed as\nRobot & Frank\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nScreenwriter: Christopher D. Ford\nStarring: Frank Langella, Peter\nSarsgaard, Liv Tyler, James Marsden,\nSusan Sarandon\nThe old man and the machine\na real person? As the story develops,\nthe themes of memory and identity\nbecome more pronounced, particularly when contrasted between human\nand robot. Robot will never forget anything unless his memory is completely\nerased by his user, whilst Frank periodically forgets his own children yet is\ntoo stubborn to accept help.\nDespite these topics which are explored the \ufb01lm largely avoids feeling\nlike science-\ufb01ction, especially with\nregards to the plot. We get only brief\nglimpses into a world of futuristic cars\nand video calling. Indeed, the \ufb01lm is\nset in \u2018the near future\u2019, not a particular year, such that the viewer doesn\u2019t\nfeel like they are displaced in time. The\ncharacter of Robot is a success: believ-ably clunky yet pleasingly hi-tech. As\nhalf of the titular double act it was\nfundamental that the audience could\nbelieve that Robot might exist, which\nis helped hugely by the personality that\nPeter Sarsgaard gives him, as it becomes clear that Robot can make his\nown judgements, and can choose how\nto help Frank. Or can he? Often, Robot\nis the source of comedy as his naivety\nin particular is exposed. That Robot\ncan have his straight-laced programming somewhat bent by Frank helps\nwith accepting him, rather than some\ncomplete automaton. This central relationship progresses realistically, even if\nit takes unexpected directions.\nIndeed, Robot is a far more interesting character than the human characters that surround Frank, and is,\nperhaps signi\ufb01cantly, given more development than Frank\u2019s super\ufb01cial and\nsomewhat boring children, portrayed\nby James Marsden and Liv Tyler. The\nscenes focusing on these characters\nslow the \ufb01lm, with Tyler being particularly annoying. Susan Sarandon,\nas a potential companion/love interest\nfor Frank is better served as a librarian in a future when books have become \u2018retro-cool\u2019, which positions her\nin a changing world where she doesn\u2019t\nquite \ufb01t, like Frank. Although it is very\nrare that both Frank and Robot are\nnot on screen, when one or the other\nis absent you are keen to get back to\nwatching Robot and Frank, which the\n\ufb01lm largely obliges us with. Enough is\nmade of their relationship that despite\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s relatively short running time\nit does not feel like an opportunity\nmissed. The \ufb01lm is well structured and\nwell-paced, with the story being told at\na good pace until the close which with\na late, sly but logical development ends\nsomewhat ambiguously \u2013 not in terms\nof plot but regarding the emotions of\nthe central characters. As a perfectly\nformed oddity, this \ufb01lm could quite\neasily be overlooked by those seeking\nmore spectacular thrills, or even more\ndramatic performances, but this is a\n\ufb01lm which should be seen, even if it is\nhard to de\ufb01ne.\nThe return of the Evil Dead\nEvil Dead\nDirector: Fede Alvarez\nScreenwriter: Fede Alvarez, Rodo\nSayagues\nStarring: Jane Levy, Shiloh\nFernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica\nLucas, Elizabeth Blackmore\nSimon Boyd Film Writer\nThe original Evil Dead was one of\nthe classic video nasties. Made for\n$350,000 (1000th of the budget of director Sam Raimi\u2019s later \ufb01lm SpiderMan 3), it has become a cult classic and\nstaple of the horror genre. It\u2019s a splatter-\ufb01lled mess of black comedy, genuine terror and low-budget creepiness. It\nstill scares and combines over-the-top\nset pieces with wit, strong characters\nand the all important shock factor;\nthere\u2019s something about the pre-CGI\ne\ufb00ects that give it a tangible ickiness.\nThe story has become a huge horror\ntrope now, a group of young attractive\ntwenty-somethings go to a cabin in\nthe woods to party. One of them \ufb01nds\na creepy looking book and reads from\nit, this unleashes a demon which possesses one of the members and chaos\nensues.\nIts production is as famous as the\n\ufb01lm. The actors described it as one of\nthe worst experiences they had ever\nhad. Opaque contact lenses meant that\nwhen the demons were attacking (with\nreal weapons) they couldn\u2019t even see\nwhat they were doing. Bruce Campell\n(as career-de\ufb01ning Ash) twisted his\nankle during production, and legend\ngoes Sam Raimi kept poking it with a\nstick to keep continuity.\nOriginal director Raimi hand-picked\nFede Alvarez for the remake, and although not directly involved, gave his\napproval. It takes place 30 years after\nthe original, and there was an e\ufb00ort to\navoid using too much CGI and rely on\n\u201cmagic tricks and illusion tricks\u201d. But\ndoes it work? Will it get lost in a sea of\nother pitiful remakes or go some way\nto capture the magic of the original?\nIt\u2019s always a good sign when there\nare three huge guys cowering at the\nentrance to the cinema screen, daring\neach other to go in \ufb01rst. The \ufb01lm posters boldly claim that it\u2019s \u201cthe most terrifying \ufb01lm you will ever experience\u201d\nand it has a long way to go to reach the\ncult status of the 1983 classic.\nIn short, it\u2019s nowhere near as good\nas the original. It lacks the wit and\nhumour of Raimi\u2019s version, and barely\neven alludes to the touches that set the\noriginal apart. It takes itself a little too\nseriously at times, only really letting its\nhair down at the end, and doesn\u2019t really try and \ufb01x the problems that the\noriginal had.\nThere is another problem in remaking this \ufb01lm, due to the 2012 Josh Whedon epic The Cabin in the Woods. For\nthose who haven\u2019t seen it (and if you\nhaven\u2019t I urge you to), it was a meta-horror \ufb01lm that completely blew apart\nthis very horror trope. Like Wes Craven\u2019s Scream did to slashers, it showed\njust how archetypal such \ufb01lms had\nbecome and almost dared them to up\ntheir game and change what they did.\nIt made you re-think the whole genre.\nWithout the many black comic\ntouches, Evil Dead almost slips into\nbeing pedestrian and \u201cjust another\ncabin in the woods\u201d \ufb01lm. Whedon\u2019s\n\ufb01lm showed us what was wrong with\nthe genre, and Evil Dead doesn\u2019t really\ntry to change things.\nDespite all this, overall I liked it.\nThe story has been changed slightly,\nthe cabin serves as a remote building\nto help an addict go cold turkey. This\nnot only actually gives a decent reason\nwhy people would stay at such a creepy\nspot, but also twists the plot slightly.\nAs things begin to get increasingly\nweird and the addict character gets\npossessed, the others just assume it is\nthe side e\ufb00ect to withdrawal.\nOne thing to say about it is that it is\nan incredibly well made \ufb01lm; \ufb01rst-time\ndirector Alvarez knows how to capture\nthe mood of a scene and picks some\nexcellent shots. CGI is largely ignored\nand this really makes an improvement\n(take note \ufb01lm directors!). Everything\nlooks incredible and the tension is held\nreally well. The gore is pitch perfect,\nthe blood may start a bit slower than\nthe original but by the end there are\ngallons of it.\nIt\u2019s also both creepy AND scary. It\nmakes you jump, but by racking up the\nfear instead of relying on cheap scares.\nI did laugh out loud a couple of times\nas well, there\u2019s something about a brief\nmoment of comedy in between horrifying scenes which can get big laughs.\nAll in all, I\u2019d say it was a good \ufb01lm,\nand an excellent one for a \ufb01rst-time di-rector. Don\u2019t go in expecting a darkly\nblack comedy like Raimi\u2019s stu\ufb00, and\nde\ufb01nitely don\u2019t go in if you are squeam-ish. It is a really well-made \ufb01lm, with\nsome great touches, some surprises\nand some nice nods to the original. I\u2019d\nbe interested to see what Alvarez does\nnext, give him an original script with a\nbit of a spark to it and I think he could\ndeliver something really special. He\nhasn\u2019t quite hit it this time, but it\u2019s a\ndamn good e\ufb00ort.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\nThe real cost of our cheap clothing\ns a new term dawns we\nknow we won\u2019t be the\nonly ones indulging in\na little online shopping\nprocrastination. We are\noften reminded to think about where\nthe various elements of our life come\nfrom, our food, our energy, but what\nabout our clothes? At a time when\nyour moral and ethical values are seriously questioned if you are seen buying anything other than free range,\norganic super eggs we very rarely\nquestion shopping at chains like Primark of H&M. Well, who can blame\nus when we can buy all our shoes for\nunder a tenner, right? Maybe not.\nDue to all of us being such diligent\nstudents who barely have time to leave\nthe library let alone pick up a newspa-per, many may not be aware of a disaster that took place over the course of\nlast week. On Wednesday 24th April,\na building containing three garment\nfactories collapsed near the centre of\nthe Dhaka the capital city of Bangladesh. The building, which has been\nundergoing renovation, had been told\nto close after large cracks appeared\nthe day before the disaster. Despite\nthis, the garment factories opened\nas normal with employees being told\nthey would lose their jobs unless they\narrived at work as usual. Due to this,\nsome 377 people, of the 3000 people\ninside the building at the time of the\ncollapse, are known to have died and\nhundreds are still missing.\nAs shocking and awful as this tragedy is, the more shocking thing to\nlearn is that this is just another event\nin a series of catastrophes that mar\nthe Bangladeshi textile industry. Just\n6 months ago another factory caught\n\ufb01re killing 123 people and leaving another 150 injured.\nThe growth of the textile industry\nhas sometimes been compared to the\nIndustrial revolution and it is true\nthat it has provided jobs, especially\nfor Bangladeshi women, but at what\ncost?\nAn online Bangladeshi news source\nbdnews24.com published an article\nlast week titled \u201cDespite disasters,\nBangladesh works for retailers\u201d. It details that despite industrial disasters\nin the garment industry, there were\nfew signs that safety issues and other\nquestionable labour conditions are\nhaving any e\ufb00ect on major Western\nretailers, their shareholders and the\nconsumers. Ready-made garments\nmake up 80% of Bangladesh\u2019s total ex-ports, which makes it harder for the\ncountry to take a stand against Western exploits.\nAbout 18 months before the previous big tragedy in Bangladesh - a \ufb01re\nin November in a textile factory that\nkilled 112 people - shareholders at\nWal-Mart Stores Inc had the opportunity to weigh in on the safety ques-tion. By a nearly 50-to-1 margin, they\nrejected a proposal to require suppliers to report annually on safety issues\nat their factories. In arguing against\nthe proposal, Wal-Mart\u2019s management made its reasoning clear: Having suppliers compile such reports\n\u201ccould ultimately lead to higher costs\nfor Walmart and higher prices for our\ncustomers. This would not be in the\nbest interests of Walmart\u2019s shareholders and customers and would place\nWalmart at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d the company said in proxy ma-terials. (Source: bdnews24.com)\nThis sends a clear message from\nthese companies. End of the day, it\u2019s\na simply calculation that has hardly\nbeen swayed by industrial disasters.\nCheaper products appeal to shoppers\nand the taints from these incidents are\nmanageable through PR stunts. Take\nPrimark for example. After it was\nrevealed that Rana Plaza contained\none of its suppliers, the company was\nquick to take a PR stand and \u201creview\nits commitments constantly to ensure\nthey met the needs of the victims as\nthe tragedy continues to unfold\u201d. Their\nmove to pay compensation to some\nof the victims only came after several\nprotests outside its store on Oxford\nStreet.\nThe share prices for these companies\nstay perfectly intact as news of these\nkinds of disasters fade away from people\u2019s minds. The world\u2019s court system\nstands idly on the sidelines as well. In\n2005, a lawsuit \ufb01led in California state\ncourt on behalf of factory workers in\nBangladesh, China, Indonesia and\nother countries accusing Wal-Mart of\nfailing to address substandard working conditions in suppliers\u2019 factories.\nThe case was ultimately dismissed and\nno US lawsuits have been \ufb01led against\nWal-Mart since then on similar mat-ters.\nThere have been pressures from activists regarding working conditions\nin garment factories but it has simply\nbeen a case of the little person trying\nto stand up to big companies. Companies often resist e\ufb00orts to force a\ndeeper discussion about the tradeo\ufb00s\nbetween worker safety and product\ncosts.\nBefore Wal-Mart invited shareholders to this year\u2019s annual meeting, to\ntake place June 7, the board of directors rebu\ufb00ed another e\ufb00ort to force a\nshareholder vote on workplace safety\nissues. According to documents \ufb01led\nwith the US Securities and Exchange\nCommission, a shareholder presented\na proposal to require the company to\nreport on its progress for assessing\nrisks to human rights in its operations and supply chain. But Wal-Mart\nsaid the proposal was so similar to the\none that failed in 2011, and that it already addresses the request through\nits standards for suppliers, that it did\nnot merit reconsideration. The SEC\napproved its decision to reject the request for a shareholder vote.\nA common thought to most people buying the clothes produced in\nthese factories is what can I do? Being\nstudents it may be di\ufb03cult to always\nconsider where and how our clothes\nare being produced. It is even harder,\ntowards the end of a long term when\nthe student loan has run out and the\nlaundry pile is building up. One can\u2019t\nsurely be blamed for running to Primark to stock up on essentials like\nsocks. It is not always feasible to avoid\nthe high street bargains. But until it is,\nyou could donate at least something\nto RCSU RAG\u2019s fund for the victims\nof the Bangladesh textile factory col-lapse, even if it\u2019s just the cost of a\nPrimark t-shirt. All the money raised\nis going towards Save the Children\u2019s\nEmergency fund and will be used to\nsupport children who were either injured in the collapse or who lost their\nparents. This will allow some help to\nthe victims and raise awareness of the\nconditions that most of our clothes\nare produced in.\nWe know it is not possible to always\nshop ethically produced clothing, but\nhopefully being a little more informed\nwill help you know when you can.\nIt only takes 2 minutes to donate.\nDonate at www.rcsu.org.uk/donate\nFood Co-op launching at Imperial\nPlabon Saha and Imogen Smith ontherecentdisasterinBangladesh\nImperial\u2019s \ufb01rst food co-operative is\nstarting next week! If you are looking\nfor a\ufb00ordable food that bene\ufb01ts the\nproducers and the planet then look\nno further! The aim of the co-op is\nto provide the Imperial College community with a one-stop shop for ethically sourced goods. We all know, and\nparticularly during exam times, that\neating well can be di\ufb03cult; even Sainsbury\u2019s on Cromwell Road seems like a\ntrek to another land. We aim to give\nyou a more ethical, and more convenient alternative. Our goods, sourced\nthrough a co-operative supplier, are all\nFairtrade, grown in Britain or organic\n(if not a combination of all three)!\nIf you think all of this ethical goodness comes at a premium, think again.\nThe beauty of the co-op model is that\nwe don\u2019t make a pro\ufb01t; we keep prices low for you. We sell goods at cost\nprice, which makes our prices similar\nto regular supermarket lines (but our\nproducts are much better for the environment and the people who have\nproduced the food).\nOur ordering system is regular and\n\ufb02exible, so you can order speci\ufb01c\nproducts directly from us, including:\nwholefoods, gluten free foods and\nproducts that cater for vegetarians\nand vegans.\nOur launch event is on Thursday\n9th May in the Sher\ufb01eld Foyer all\nday long, so come and see the range\nof products we have! The community sets to bene\ufb01t from this scheme,\nso please do get involved if you want\nto help make positive change to our\nshopping and eating habits. Join our\nFacebook group, and promote the coop to your friends! If you\u2019re interested\nin volunteering with us then please do\nemail coop@imperial.ac.uk.\nA\nThomas Lim Writer\n\n"

Instead, doodle all lecture long and then send us your drawings\nto arts.felix@ic.ac.uk. This popped up in the Physics common room. Who\nelsehasbeenworkinghardonrevision?\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\n12\nWe all fucking love science, but it has\nto be admitted that, frankly, it can get\nachingly dull. How many times have\nyou heard the words, \u201cafter a month\nand a half of protocol optimisation, my\nexperiment has failed again! Isn\u2019t this so\nFUN?\u201d That\u2019s right, never.\nDespite this, you don\u2019t have to look\ntoo far to rediscover the lighter side of\nscience. At Imperial an initiative, Artifact, has been set up by students to\nencourage the creation of artistic works\ninspired by science and technology. At\na recent meeting, I met Raphael Kim, a\ndesign interaction student at the Royal\nCollege of Arts. Ever since, I have been\nprobing him with questions about his\nwork.\nJust as science proposes questions\nabout the world, Raphael has taken this\nnotion and added the twist of asking scienti\ufb01c questions through the medium\nof design.\nA BSc in biotechnology and a year\nspent scrutinising proteins in Switzerland are not circumstances unfamiliar\nto many Imperial students. How about\ntaking scienti\ufb01c questions out of a research setting and answering them in\na context unrestricted by commercial\npro\ufb01teering or the pressure of saving\nlives?\nPartly inspired by the Citizen Science\nconcept resulting from his previous\nlab project and some DIY aspects of\nsynthetic biology, Raphael explores the\nless obvious links between science and\ndesign.\nTake a glass of water, extract microscopic organisms called rotifers, and\ndesign. The Gene Hunting Device exploits the phenomenon of horizontal\ngene transfer, which allows rotifers to\nincorporate pieces of DNA from their\nenvironment into their genome. Introducing a gene encoding a \ufb02uorescent\nprotein and when it encounters a gene\nbeing hunted for (sort of like a switch),\nthe rotifer glows (much like a LED bulb)\nto indicate that the target DNA is in the\nenvironment.\nAs Raphael\u2019s work is based on scienti\ufb01c phenomena, I wondered whether\nthe design aspect set him free from the\nscienti\ufb01c laws which make research so\nfrustratingly exact.\n\u201cI guess starting a project with a scienti\ufb01c hypothesis is something ingrained\nin me.\u201d He says, \u201cbut you also need to\nthink about visual and aesthetic aspects\nto communicate scienti\ufb01c elements.\nMicrobes are not usually visible to the\nnaked eye - but if you are undertaking a\ndesign project, it may force you to focus\non the visual language of how microbes\ncould be depicted. How do you show\nsomething that is normally invisible to\nus in a way that is thought-provoking?\u201d\nIf the biosensing principles of the\nGene Hunting Device are slightly too\nscienti\ufb01c for your design liking try Space\nBacteria based on a scienti\ufb01cally unlimited \u2018what if\u2019 concept.\nWe already exploit micro-organisms\nnaturally found in extreme conditions,\nbut earthly extremes are no match for\nthose found in space. Generated with\nthe help of designer Jae Yeop Kim, the\nnext idea involves genetically modify\nbacteria taken from human bodies using synthetic biology techniques before\nfarming them on Mars. The result is to\nsee how they would evolve and survive,\nand how useful they could be back here\non Earth.\n\u201cYou have to forget about the limitations when you start a project, and keep\nan open mind\u201d says Raphael.\n\u201cScience dictates that it is unlikely for\nbacteria to grow in large colonies on\nMars. We explored this with an assumption that we may \ufb01nd a way around the\nproblem of harsh Martian conditions.\nOnce we were unchained from these re-strictions, it was really about designing\nfor a possible future and allowing the\naudience to \ufb01nish our story. For what\npurpose do we want to send bacteria to\nMars, and what are the potential social\nand cultural implications of creating agriculture beyond our planet?\u201d\nAs we hear about scienti\ufb01c and arts\nfunding cuts, I wondered how di\ufb03cult it\nwas for a designer to carry out such pro-jects. It turns out the creativity moulding his work extends further than just\nshaping it\u2019s substance and style.\n\u201cPetri dishes were bought from a\nschool supplier, a cheap oven (incuba-tor) from Argos, and agar powder from\na Chinese restaurant in Soho. Once\ntransferred to liquid medium, bacteria\nwere collected using a DIY centrifuge. I\nhad made several variations of these \u2013\nsome from salad spinners, egg whisks\nand a small electric drill,\u201d he explains\nof his project Tangible, which uses the\nbacteria to form the shapes of objects\nresembling those found in daily life.\nBy giving the usually invisible bacteria\nan unavoidable physical presence, the\nviewer is made to think about how we\ninteract with them and how di\ufb00erent\nthis is when we remember that bacteria\nare living organisms capable of modifying designs we interact with everyday.\nI was glad to hear that working with\nscience from a di\ufb00erent perspective\ndidn\u2019t completely exclude Raphael from\nthe world of research.\n\u201cI think it is fair to say that the scienti\ufb01c community consists of a variety of\ncharacters who are and are not open to\nintegrating with artists and designers.\nYou can always drop a polite email to\na researcher you are interested in. You\nmay not get an immediate response, but\nit is mostly a matter of perseverance.\u201d\nDesigner genes\nLily Le Writer\nLibrary cafe\nimproves catering\n\n"

This remarkable change from everything going to\nplan to everything going tits up, only\nto revert back to going to plan some\ntime afterwards would set the pace (at\nabout 45 km/h) for the weekend.\nSaturday, 02:00. Arrive at mountain hut in the middle of nowhere,\nWales. After being warned of \u2018low\noutside temperature\u2019 by the van\u2019s\nsweetly humanitarian dashboard dis-play, we could con\ufb01rm for ourselves\nthat it was right nippy in that hut.\nAfter what felt like lying down on a\nwooden board for about four hours\nbeing woken up periodically by some\nsmut or other from Will and BTB in\nthe Presidential Suite, we got up to\nput Lycra on, eat hot bacon & beans\nand get outside in what turned out to\nbe glorious sunshine. The \ufb01rst day of\nriding was one of the best rides I\u2019ve\never been on \u2013 and I think all others\ncould say the same. 65 miles of curv-ing, smooth roads up some of Britain\u2019s\nbest climbing roads in perfect cycling\nweather \u2013 sun out, no wind. I\u2019m told\nthe MTBers also had an amazing time\nwalking through the ice up the tallest\nmountain in Wales with bikes on their\nbacks. But then, I guess what goes up\na mountain gets to come down pretty\nquickly \u2013 so fair enough. That even-ing, due to a packed-out pub in a little Welsh railway village (the only one\nfor miles around), we had hot steak &\nale pies on an ice-cold picnic bench\noutside. The waitress kindly turned\na blind eye to us using the placemats\nas arse-mats, an action which for me\ndeserves a Michelin star in itself. Get\nback to hut, 2 lads sick into bog after\nperilous descent down trapdoor ladder (o\ufb00 beer? Too much beer?) and a\ngood night\u2019s sleep for more riding in\nthe morning.\nThe second day was to see things going pretty far from the original plan.\nRoadies jumped at the chance to be\nable to do a real A-to-B \u00e9tape, taking\nin 60 miles of big hills via Lake Bala\nbefore arriving at the Coed-y-Brenin\nTrail Centre where we would meet our\nknobbly-tyred brothers with the minibuses to head back to London. About\n15 miles from the \ufb01nish in waning\ndaylight and gathering cold, unfortunate events and the kindness of strangers would change the face of the Cycling Club, for at least a week or two.\nA crash involving a fractured carbon\nfork (!) on a cattle grid would leave the\ninjured Tom, a broken bike and about\n7 or 8 lads huddled on bleak Welsh\nmoorland while me and Dan race after\na Welsh man in his car we spotted a\nOn the 20th April, Imperial\u2019s Ultimate\nFrisbee team \u2212 the discDoctors \u2212 took\nto the \ufb01elds in Nottingham to compete against the country\u2019s top clubs\nat Outdoor Nationals, the highlight of\nthe competitive calendar for university Ultimate. Battling it out across two\ndays of intense competition, the team\nfound their feet after a sluggish start to\nsecure an impressive third place in the\ntournament\u2019s second division.\nHaving endured subzero conditions\nto earn their spot in the competition\nat the south-east regional quali\ufb01ers in\nMarch, the team was surprised to be\ngreeted by warm sun and little wind to\nspeak of \u2212 ideal conditions for quick\nand competitive Ultimate. After a disappointing loss to Newcastle in the\nopening game, Imperial soon got over\ntheir early jitters to brush past a spirited Bristol team. With intense man-marking in defence combined with\nincisive and \ufb02owing attacking play\n\u2212 particularly from David Pryce and\nStephan Rossbauer \u2212 the team put on\na ruthless display, recording a convincing 13\u22127 victory.\nThe \ufb01nal group game saw Imperial\ntake on a well-drilled Nottingham out\ufb01t in their most physical encounter so\nfar. The game even saw the team\u2019s \ufb01rst\ncasualty of the tournament, as Ashley Hemingway tore two ligaments\ncompeting for the disc, leaving him\non crutches for the remainder of the\nweekend after a hasty trip to A&E.\nDespite losing out narrowly in a hard-fought contest, the discDoctors had\ndone enough to secure second place in\nthe group after other results fell kind-ly. This left old foes Portsmouth, who\nImperial had recently edged past in a\ntense encounter during regional quali\ufb01ers, standing in the way of a place in\nSunday\u2019s quarter-\ufb01nals.\nNow in their fourth game of the day,\nImperial really started to come into\ntheir own against an opponent that\nstruggled to keep up with the pace\nof the game. The discDoctors raced\nto an early lead, thanks in part to an\nunstoppable performance from James\nThreadgill, and displayed calm and\nclinical e\ufb03ciency in attack to \ufb01nish\nwith a 9\u22125 win.

Blistering pace from captain Phil Sandwell\nand a towering performance from\nMatthew Okenyi helped the team secure an 11\u22126 victory, and left them\njust one win away from a coveted place\nin the \ufb01nals. With the team\u2019s momentum gathering, however, they \ufb01nally\nmet their match in the form of a ruthlessly organised Limerick side. The\nIrish team employed a zonal marking\nsystem that put a lot of pressure on\nImperial\u2019s throws in the increasingly\nbreezy conditions. Despite hard work\nfrom Pryce and Rossbauer, and James\nWard\u2019s unending commitment to putting his body on the line in defence,\nLimerick\u2019s tactical prowess proved too\nmuch for the team. The Irish side went\non to lose narrowly to Nottingham in\nthe \ufb01nals.\nImperial had little time to dwell on\nthis disappointment as they faced up\nto St Andrews in the 3\u22124 play-o\ufb00. The\nbagpipe accompaniment provided\nby their Scottish opponents lent the\n\ufb01nal game of the weekend a suitable\nelement of grandeur, and both teams\nseemed determined to \ufb01nish the tournament on a high.

    "content": "Heads... or tails...?\nRoss Webster giveshisspoiler-freereviewofBioshock:Infinite\nhe long wait is \ufb01nally\nover. After being teased\nfor way over a year, the\nthird game of the Bioshock franchise is out. I\ndedicated a good chunk of my life to\nthe game already, so I think I\u2019m in a\ngood enough place to review it.\nI\u2019m going to skip my usual spiel\nabout the history of the series, and\njust jump into the city of Columbia \u2013\nthe location of Bioshock: Infinite\u2019s sto-ry. You are Booker DeWitt, a former\nPinkerton agent (Pinkertons is a real-life detective agency) who amassed a\nlot of gambling debt. Given the option to wipe the slate clean by retriv-ing a girl from the city of Columbia,\nyou jump at the chance, and you start\nplaying Booker just as you\u2019re on your\nway to the city.\nIf you\u2019ve played either of the previous titles (Bioshock, and Bioshock 2)\nyou\u2019ll understand how the game aims\nto have you immersed in the world\naround you. Despite the prequels being dark and grimy, the levels still had\ncharacter, with signs of recent life all\naround you, in the tight underwater\ncon\ufb01nes of Rapture. Infinite not only\ntakes a leaf from this book, but turns\nthe whole page over. No longer stuck\nin the claustrophobic and abandoned\nworld of Rapture, you are catapulted\nin the vibrant and living world of Columbia, the city above the clouds.\nKids are playing in the street, couples lay down in the grass with their\npicnic set \u2013 this is a world that, instead of simply using audio recordings\nto create the history and personality,\nuses the inhabitants to charm you.\nAs soon as you emerge in Columbia,\nyou\u2019re presented with one of the main\nthemes of the game. This time, there\nis no industrialist who builds a city to\ndrive his capitalist views, instead you\nhave a prophet who created a haven in\nthe clouds, to save his devotees from\nthe sodom below.\nSoon, you\u2019re faced with vigors (the\nnew term for plasmids), the comedy duo and of course, racism. Tasteful, historically accurate racism, but\nstill, I\u2019m surprised how they got this\nthrough the censors.\nYou soon \ufb01nd your ward, Elizabeth,\nand then it\u2019s the.... uh.... simple... task\nof getting back to the surface. Thankfully, Elizabeth has the ability to open\n\u2018tears\u2019 (rhymes with bears, not beers)\ninto other dimensions, allowing you to\nbring in automated turrets, weapons,\nallies, etc to the \ufb01ght. Luckily, you\u2019re\nnot the only thorn in the prophet\u2019s\nbackside, as a rebellion, led by a group\nknown as the Vox Populi, is wreaking\nhavoc across Columbia.\nCombat is the same as Bioshock 2 \u2013\nleft click \ufb01res your weapon, and right\nclick uses your plas.. vigor (dammit,\nevery time). There\u2019s a wide selection\nof weapons and plasmids to suit your\nplaystyle, along with upgrades to both,\nso that\u2019s all \ufb01ne and dandy. Travel in\nColumbia is a bit of an issue, when\nit\u2019s made up of \ufb02oating platforms.\nYou can\u2019t really have a lot of associated risk, each time you want to move\naround, so you use the skyline instead.\nImagine railway tracks that \ufb02oat in the\nair, and you luckily picked up a set of\ntrain wheels right at the start. Oh, that\nreminds me \u2013 melee is back and is as\nbrutal as ever \u2013 this time, you get to\nsmash faces in with your skyhook, and\nif you\u2019re feeling particularly stressed\nout, you can execute your opponents\nin beautiful visceral detail.\nMany people feared that you would\nbe having to rescue Elizabeth again\nand again, a la clich\u00e9d escort mode,\nbut she can take care of herself, and\nspends her free time rummaging\nthrough rubbish to give you extra\nammo and money. In fact, she puts\nway more e\ufb00ort into this relationship\nthat you do.\nFurther a\ufb03rming Webster\u2019s First\nLaw of Gaming, adding hats makes\neverything better. You\u2019ve got four inventory slots that can have di\ufb00erent\ntypes of clothing, that all grant di\ufb00erent traits and abilities. Think of them\nas the new tonics.\nThere\u2019s not much more to say about\nthe game, without me mentioning speci\ufb01c areas, moments, fabulous hats, or\nparts of the storyline.

    "content": "The Fault in Our Stars\nFreud was the \ufb01rst to identify the dualistic principle of Love and Death,\npersoni\ufb01ed in the Greek gods Eros and\nThanatos, as a key component of the\nhuman psyche. In his description, the\n\ufb01rst is the drive for reproduction, the\npositive instinct of preservation and\ncreation of life; but human beings also\ndisplay an opposed destructive instinct\ntowards others and sometimes them-selves. Attempting to explain our every\nactions in these terms may be reduc-tive; but in John Green\u2019s fourth novel,\nThe Fault In Our Stars, love and death\nbecome real forces, and their painful\nclash is the central theme of the book.\nThe story is told by Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is sixteen years old and has\nlung cancer, or in her words, \u201clungs\nthat suck at being lungs\u201d. She carries\naround with her a little steel cart with\nan oxygen tank and is not very good at\ngoing up stairs. Hazel knows she is going to die. At Cancer Support Group,\namong a crowd of other teenagers, she\nmeets Augustus Waters, a charismatic\nex-basketball player who has lost a\nleg to osteosarcoma and is now NEC\n(No Evidence of Cancer), and likes to\nindulge in metaphorically charged behaviour such as holding an unlit cigarette in his mouth.\nHazel and Augustus\u2019 story begins\nhere and is told masterfully by Green.\nHis witty, genuine humour is alternated to sad, tragic moments in an\narticulate counterpoint. The prose is\nnever predictable or descending into\ncheap sentimentalism, a testimony\nto the author\u2019s skill as a writer; to his\ninsight and understanding as a human being. Perhaps the characters are\nunrealistically smart and well-spoken;\nbut this novel is truly a pleasure to read\nthrough.\nHazel lends her favourite book, by\nDutch author Peter Van Houten, to\nAugustus and he becomes fascinated\nby it as well. It is about a young girl dying of cancer, and ends abruptly in the\nmiddle of a sentence. The unknown\nfate of all the story\u2019s characters is Hazel\u2019s obsession, so Augustus decides\nto get in touch with the author who\nagrees to speak about the book, provided it is in person. Augustus then\nuses the \u201cwish\u201d that a foundation for\nterminally ill children o\ufb00ers him, to \ufb02y\nto Holland with Hazel to meet him.\nThe two protagonists arrive in Amsterdam where Van Houten turns out\nto be an odd, embittered man, who\nrudely sends them away. We are left\nto follow Hazel and Augustus in Amsterdam. In Anne Frank\u2019s house, they\nkiss to the sound of applause from\nthe crowd. Here as in the rest of the\nnovel, we are all the time exposed to\ntheir re\ufb02ections upon illness and life,\ndeath and remembrance, spoken in a\nmanner that is real and raw, with true,\ndry sentiment. At the end of the trip,\nAugustus reveals to Hazel that his cancer is back and has spread through his\nbody: \u201cThe lining of my chest, my left\nhip, my liver, everywhere. Everywhere.\nThat word hung in the air awhile. We\nboth knew what it meant.\u201d\nThe complex relationship between\nlove and death emerges continuously\nthroughout the book and particularly\nafter Augustus\u2019 revelation. As the two\nteenagers fall in love the ephemeral\nquality of their respective lives forces\nthem to dedicate a lot of thought to\nthings that most of us (let alone most\nof us at the age of sixteen) light-heart-edly ignore: how hard it is to love and\nbe loved knowing that all that will be\nleft are scars; how inadvertently ridiculous we are in acting as immortal\nbeings allowing ourselves to use words\nsuch as \u201cforever\u201d and \u201calways\u201d; yet how\ninevitable and necessary it is to do so.\nThe sentence: \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about\npain: it demands to be felt.\u201d is quoted\nseveral times; in the same way, death\ndemands for its towering presence to\nbe acknowledged.\nThe con\ufb01dent Augustus is shown is\nhis last days in all his fragility amidst\nthe \ufb02atly grotesque ugliness of illness.\nGreen depicts him dazed by narcotics\nand lying in a pool of his own urine\nin his bed, or vomiting on himself.\nThe sincerity of the storyteller only\nstrengthens the romance, in its almost\npainful humanity. Death accelerates\ntime and in the end what\u2019s left is for\nHazel is the gratitude for \u201ca forever\nwithin the numbered days\u201d. A read I\nrecommend, powerful and touching.\nJohn Green is an American writer\nof young \ufb01ction. He has won several\nprizes for his books, and The Fault In\nOur Stars has received much critical appraisal. Green and his brother\nHank, have an entertaining YouTube\nchannel called Vlogbrothers, where\nthey exchange their geeky video correspondence and through which they\nhave amassed an impressive horde of\nfollowers \u2013 the Nerd\ufb01ghters (nerd\ufb01ghters.ning.com). You can \ufb01nd out more\nabout the brothers at hankgreen.com.\nComing in at 114 pages long, Siddhartha is by far the easiest book to read\nby a Nobel Prize winning author. The\nguy I borrowed my copy o\ufb00 managed\nto read the whole thing in a particularly slow \ufb02ight back from Jordan. I\nhad only vaguely heard of either the\nbook or the author before having the\npaper-back thrust into my hands,\nbut it bore the trusted sign of being\na \u201cPenguin Modern Classic,\u201d with its\ntasteful but artsy cover; so I \ufb01gured\nI\u2019d give it a go.\nIntensely spiritual throughout, Siddhartha tells the story of the eponymous character on his journey from\nbeing an irritating stuck-up brat to\nbeing a sage and wise old man in India\nat the time of the Buddha. The son of\na Brahmin, Siddhartha feels that as a\nteen he has already learnt all that the\nBrahmins of his town can teach him,\nand with his long su\ufb00ering buddy\nGovinda in tow; sets out to discover\nthe world by hanging out with various spiritual groups. He gets bored of\nthem, decides to trade it all in for a life\nof luxury, realises that such a life has\ncorrupted him, and then \ufb01nds peace\nliving a simple life as an old man.\nBe\ufb01tting of a book about a preten-tious, irritating kid; the narrative style\ncan at times be dense and overly poet-ic. The characters refer to themselves\nin the third person with an alarming\nfrequency and the \ufb02orid otherworldly\ndialogue was a source of occasionally\nintense frustration.\nUpon overcoming the initial annoyance of the writing style, the e\ufb00ect of\nit is to set the reader up as a dispassionate observer; I found myself going\nalong with Siddhartha in his journey\nbut not becoming overly involved in\neach scenario individually. As a result the overall feeling one takes away\nfrom the book is that it is a lesson being taught to you, as opposed to the\nreader learning themselves directly\nfrom the shared experience between\nthe protagonists and the reader. The\ndownside of this is that moments that\nare extremely emotional for Siddhartha feel passive and detached \u2013 there\nis a passage in the \ufb01nal third where, as\nHerman Hesse\u2019s Siddhartha\nMatt Allinson Writer\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\n14\nAlejandro Torrado Pacheco Writer\nan old man, he experiences deep loss\nand abandonment, yet when reading\nit I felt disturbingly little. The overall\nresult of this is in keeping with the\nmain aim of the book \u2013 once Siddhartha recovers, we learn how these\nevents have a\ufb00ected his view on the\nworld, and helped him come closer to\nachieving Nirvana; which is all fair\nand good, but I still prefer my novels\nto have a bit more emotional bite.\nThis isn\u2019t saying that Siddhartha\nisn\u2019t the classic that the well-quali\ufb01ed\neditors at Penguin seem to think it\nis. Despite lacking grit and realism\nthat makes you feel \u2018there\u2019 and in the\nstory, the combination of emotional\ndistance from the story teller and the\nridiculously poetic, but ultimately\nbeautiful language instead give the\nreader the experience of looking at a\ngreat work of art, whilst the meaning\nof the painting is explained to you by\na friendly expert.\nAnd what meaning: perhaps the\ngreatest success of this book is that\nits message is how to live a simple\nlife and \ufb01nd happiness and reward in\nyour own existence. If a short book\nis hard to read and ultimately has\nan unpleasant story (Conrad\u2019s Heart\nof Darkness springs immediately to\nmind) then by the end of it the reader\nis left wondering why they bothered.\nSiddhartha, for all its petty annoy-ances, leaves the reader feeling that\ntheir life has been a\ufb03rmed, and in\nawe of the skill of the author for getting so much content crammed into\nsuch a short book.\nIf you have a long \ufb02ight soon, or\nwant a pocket sized paperback to carry with you on commutes, you can\u2019t\ngo far wrong with Siddhartha.\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n31\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Imperial College Bridge society\nwas shut down a several years ago\nbut after some convincing the Imperial College Union decided to give us\nanother shot and the Imperial College Bridge club was up and running\nagain in 2010. Our sport once again\nhad a dedicated club at our university\n(and yes, it is a sport according to the\nIOC!).\nWith a very good turnout at Fresher\u2019s Fair and our \ufb01rst session of term,\nwe were eager to prove ourselves\nas we entered in the Portland Bowl\n(British University Championship)\nin 2010. We managed to reach the\n\ufb01nals that year, which we lost to Oxford. Despite the loss we were all very\nhappy to have made it to the \ufb01nals,\nsomething which no Imperial team\nhad done so far since the tournament\nstarted in the 1980s.\nThis year we entered the Portland\nBowl again for the 2012-2013 season and immediately drew a strong\nCambridge B team for the knock-out\nqualifying rounds. We managed to\nbeat them by a small margin only to\n\ufb01nd out our next round opponents\nwere Oxford A, who kicked us out of\nthe tournament last time! This was a\nbit of a grudge match but also a very\nimportant one, the winner would advance to the Top 4 and a chance to\nplay at the famous Portland Club in\nBrook Street. Our team played solidly and pulled o\ufb00 a convincing win\nagainst Oxford!\nLast Saturday we headed to the\nPortland Club for our semi-\ufb01nals\nmatch against Cambridge, which has\nwon the Portland Bowl more than\nany other team. It was a slugfest the\nentire day with points going back and\nforth but the overall scores remaining\nvery close. At the end of it we were\nahead by 4 IMPs (with over 100 IMPs\nhaving been exchanged). But this\nscore was still subject to change as\nCambridge had appealed two tournament director rulings which were\nstill being processed. If Cambridge\nwon both those of those appeals\nthen it would be a tie, meaning we\nwould have to play another 6 boards\nfor the tiebreaker. Fortunately for us\nthey lost both appeals and we could\nget some rest before the \ufb01nals on the\nnext day.\nOn the day of the \ufb01nals we were\nplaying very strong Edinburgh team\nwith players from the Scottish Open\nand Womens team. They had beaten\nLSE in the other semi-\ufb01nal by quite\na large margin, so this was de\ufb01nitely\nnot going to be an easy match for us\nto win. Interestingly, neither Edinburgh or Imperial College had ever\nwon the \ufb01nals of the Portland Bowl\nsince it started in 1984 so either way\nthis year\u2019s winners would be writing\nhistory.\nWe were trailing for more than half\nof the match and at the end of the 4th\nset we were behind 15 IMPs. While\nthis was not an insurmountable lead,\nwe were running out of time with\nonly 2 sets to go and needed something good to happen. That is exactly\nwhat happened when we had a monster of a 5th set and went from 15\nIMPs behind to a 29 IMP lead going\ninto the last round. Edinburgh managed to cut down on our lead by quite\na bit but not enough, the \ufb01nal score\nbeing 126-118 in favour of Imperial\nCollege!\nAs the plane door opened, the cold\nFrench, garlic and baguette ridden air\nhit us. We knew the challenge, to go\nto the French engineering university\nchampionships and beat them at their\nown sport, handball.\nWe brought with us four sides, two\nmen\u2019s and two women\u2019s, all with high\nexpectations. The men were defending champions and the women had\na very strong squad. Upon arrival we\nreceived typical French hospitality as\nwe were shown to our accommoda-tion. It was minus seven, and we were\nto stay in tents. The next morning the\ninside of all the tents were frozen and\nwe were more than a little chilly.\nAll four of the teams progressed\nsmoothly through the morning\u2019s\ngroup stages, posting some impressive\nresults, with both men\u2019s sides topping\ntheir groups, and both women\u2019s qualifying for the quarter-\ufb01nals.\nHere the men\u2019s run came to an\nend. The seconds were drawn against\nlast years defeated \ufb01nalists Central\nParis, and the \ufb01rsts against the eventual champions, Central Lyon. Despite courageous e\ufb00orts, both were\nknocked out.\nThe women however fared much\nbetter. The second team faced Central\nLille and advanced comfortably 11-8.\nThey were to then play the winners\nof Imperial 1st against Central Lyon\nAlumni. It was a truly nail-biting encounter with team captain Rebecca\nP\ufb01stner providing a commanding per-formance. The match ended 6 apiece\nafter extra-time, leading to the dreaded penalty shoot-out. Red Elmahdi\nwas heroic in goal, saving 3 of 4 penalties and helping to ensure safe passage\nto the all Imperial semi-\ufb01nal.\nBoth Women\u2019s sides were particularly strong this year and there wasn\u2019t\nmuch to pick between them. It was a\nterri\ufb01c encounter and was desperately\nclose. The second team scored in the\ndying moments to seal a memorable\n10-9 victory and receive a place in the\n\ufb01nal. The \ufb01rst\u2019s won their third place\nplay-o\ufb00 to ensure Imperial would have\ntwo teams on the podium, but the \ufb01nal was left to the next morning to decide the champion.\nThe girls met Central Lyon in the \ufb01nal. The \ufb01rst half was a tense a\ufb00air and\nthe game was locked at 6-6 at the in-terval. However in the second half the\nwomen produced a truly dominating\nperformance to win the match 13-10\nand so claimed the trophy.\nThe weekend was a great success for\nImperial and capped o\ufb00 a successful\nyear for the club. At least one team has\nbeen on the podium at all three di\ufb00erent competitions we entered this year\nand we are looking forward to the next\ntournament in Lille in April.\nWomen\u2019s Handball victorious in France\nBridge team wins University Bridge Championship\nSportsWriter\nSamuel Giles\nJorrit Schafer Sports Writer\nFirst and Third place for Imperial\nREF!

Any alcohol served\non campus must be served in according to the licence or there is a risk\nof losing it. The Chemistry Cocktail\nParty had to change the format and\nis now being moved to Metric, with\nsta\ufb00 at Metric serving the drinks in-stead. There will also be a cap on the\nnumber of cocktails that attendees\ncan have as each student may be given\nfour tokens and no more. This is due\nto licensing as irresponsible drinking\ncan not be promoted.\nThe Chemistry Cocktail Party, like\nmany other departmental events, is\norganised and run by students. It is\nusually one of the highlights of the\nyear for chemists. It has been held in\nvarious locations around College in\nthe past, from the Physics common\nroom in Blackett to the Chemistry\ncommon room. Alcohol is served\nby students on the ChemSoc Committee and/or volunteers with various di\ufb00erent cocktails being devised\n(mostly based on chemistry related\njokes). The alcohol is usually readily available and most attendees take\nfull advantage; the event often ends\nup providing a lot of memories and\nlapses in memories for those who at-tend. At the end of the party many\nstudents would move onto the Union. It has been running in a similar\nfashion for a few years. In previous\nyears there have been varying degrees\nof incidents at the party, although all\nof these incidents have been resolved\nlater.\nImperial College London have created\na paper on the future Education and\nStudent Experience strategy. Between\nnow and Friday 10 May sta\ufb00, students,\nand alumni are asked to give their\nviews on the outcome. Views are being\nsought for actions proposed and on\nwhat to prioritise. To contribute on-line, go to the following website: http://\nwww3.imperial.ac.uk/educationoffice/\nstrategy. There will also be two open\nmeetings on 17 April from 13.00 -14.00\nin the Read Lecture Theatre, Sherfield\nBuilding and on 25 April from 17.00-18.00 in the Clore Lecture Theatre,\nHuxley Building.\nProfessor Debra Humphris, who is\nheading up the strategy, said: \u201cYour responses will inform a paper outlining\nthe Education and Student Strategy\nand implementation plan which will\nbe considered by Management Board\nin June and received by Council in\nJuly.\u201d The Management Board is one\nof the highest Boards in College, and is\nchaired by the President & Rector. The\nCollege Council is ultimately responsible for College policy.\nHumphris said: \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to\nthose who contributed their time and\nideas in the initial consultation. We\nreceived a wide range of responses\nfrom sta\ufb00, students and alumni, not\nonly through our online consultation\nbut also at the open meetings and in\ndiscussion with student reps and sabbaticals.\u201d\nComputer room 204 in the Library was\nrecently locked as their was training\nscheduled. The door has a sign saying\nit is booked. This meant that students\nwere unable to use the computers in-side. However, there are days when\nnobody has been seen in the room. A\nstudent complained to the Library staff\nabout this and was told that it belongs\nto ICT, who have recently started locking it.\nEmpty\ncomputer room\nin Library kept\nlocked for days\nEducation\nand Student\nstrategy up for\nreview\nTim Arbabzadah\nallow any Imperial student (under-graduate or postgraduate) use their\nservices during opening hours only.\nImperial College gives money to the\nHealth Centre, as well as the NHS,\nwhich comes from the number of students registering.\nHealth Centre\nadvising\npostgraduate\nstudents to\nregister with\nlocal GPs\ninstead\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nImperial College London has won an\naward recognising support for the\ncareers of women in science, technol-ogy, engineering, maths and medicine.\nThe Athena Swan silver status has\nonly been granted to three universi-ties, with Queen\u2019s University Belfast\nand University of Nottingham being\nthe other two. It is a university wide\nrecognition. Athena Swan say that it\n\u201crecognises a signi\ufb01cant record of activity and achievement by the university in promoting gender equality and\nin addressing challenges across their\nSTEMM departments\u201d. Multiple Departments at Imperial also currently\nhold Silver status.\nWhen the award was conferred the\npanel noted various initiatives in Departments and College wide. These\nincluded dinners, lectures, networking events, and the Imperial women\u2019s\nportrait series.\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions, President & Rector, released a statement saying: \u201cImperial is proud to be recognised with\ninstitution-wide silver status. This is\nthe result of a serious long-term commitment to gender equality at every\nlevel in the College.\u201d O\u2019Nions said that\nfor Imperial to remain a world class\ninstitution they must \u201ccontinue to\neliminate obstacles to career progression and create new opportunities for\nwomen.\u201d He went on to stress the point\nabout remaining a world leader, say-ing: \u201cFirst and foremost, gender equality matters because it is the right thing\nto do. But we also need to attract, promote and develop outstanding female\nscientists if we are to maintain our\nplace as one of the world\u2019s great universities.\u201d Professor Dorothy Gri\ufb03ths,\nChair of Imperial College London\u2019s\nAcademic Opportunities Committee,\nsaid: \u201c\u201cGender equality requires hard\nwork on a day-to-day basis. We intend\nto keep this up and build on Imperial\u2019s\nsigni\ufb01cant progress.\u201d\nThe Athena Swan awards were created in 2005 with Imperial a founding\nmember. Their Charter was launched\nin June 2005 with three beliefs underpinning it. The beliefs include the importance of women being represented\nin a traditionally maile-dominated\narea, and that \u201cscience cannot reach\nits full potential unless it can bene\ufb01t\nfrom the talents of the whole population\u201d.

This\nemerges after the Chemistry Cocktail\nParty, which is due to be held near the\nend of this academic year, has been\nforced to have a format change due to\nlicensing laws and incidents at previous parties from other Departments\non campus.\nThe party was originally planned\nto be held in the Chemistry Caf\u00e9, as\nit was last year, with students from\nChemSoc making the drinks and giving them out. Before, a ticket would\nget the attendee as much alcohol as\nthey wanted, until it ran out.\nHowever, due to licensing laws, it\ncould not exist in its current format.\nImperial College London and Imperial College Union hold licences\nStart-ups\nThe VCC and why to start a\nstart-up Pages 6-7\nImperial College Health Centre will\nno longer be letting postgraduate\nstudents use their services if they live\noutside of the registration area.

The reason\ngiven in the statement read as fol-lows: \u201cUnfortunately there is no NHS\nfunding for such students and in the\npast the funding came from Imperial\nCollege. However this year there is\na shortfall in this funding, which the\nCollege has advised us it is unable to\nmake up\u201d.

Craving release from the con\ufb01nes of reclining seats, we unleashed\nour wild sides with our \ufb01rst fancy\ndress theme: animals. From the conventional slightly slutty leopard print\nto a penguin complete with a startlingly realistic blacked-up face, we\ngathered around our watering hole to\nenjoy games of Arrogance and 20+1\n(and less conventional variations). In\nwhat would prove to be a theme for\nthe week, we were chased from our\nroom with noise complaints from angry French residents/BUSC reps, and\n\ufb02ed into the night to seek the relative\nsafety of the town\u2019s bars.\nDespite night-time disturbances\nfrom the furious and incoherent\npenguin, most of the group was up\nfresh-faced and buzzing for \ufb01rst lifts\non our \ufb01rst day tearing up the slopes.\nThe Gods of Pow had looked favourably on us: fresh powder at Easter is\na rare treat, and what powder it was!\nOur skis and boards were barely tainted with slush or ice all week, and the\nsnow at the top of the mountain was\nas perfect as the view. We toasted the\n\ufb01rst day\u2019s success at the Apr\u00e8s-bar,\nwhere we could be found most evenings enjoying vin chaud \u2013 a pursuit\neven more enjoyable in the sunshine\nof the following days.\nEvenings merged into nights with\nmore drinking, drinking games and\nfancy dress. There were some truly\ninspired costume ideas for Wednesday night\u2019s bad taste theme at the\nmidweek party, where a rogue priest\nand his disciples spent much of the\nevening drumming up support for\ntheir society. We also dominated the\nbar on the last night with displays of\nnudity that most Metric-goers could\nonly dream of. Night-time entertainment never \ufb01nished when the bars\ndid, though. Expeditions to the only\nkebab shop in town open at 3am were\nnumerous, while back at the hotel attempts to dampen spirits by reps and\nweary roommates alike were met with\nserious resistance. Alcohol and adrenaline can often bring out the best in\npeople, though not in the case of one\nhalf of the notorious John duo, whose\nkeenness to get the \ufb01rst lift one morning began with putting his ski boots on\nat 4am.\nAs well as busting Imperial\u2019s reputation for being boring by winning\nthe prize for most noise complaints,\nwe put up an impressive show for the\nserious competition side of the week\ntoo, with competitors representing\nthe club in many ski and all snowboard disciplines. Resident Irish ba-dass John even managed to nail the\nfreestyle event with fresh stitches in\nhis shin! Thanks to some spectacularly\ngnarly tricks from the current (John)\nand future (Mikkel) Presidents, Imperial had two top-10 \ufb01nishes in the\nShred and Butter competition, and\ntop-20 \ufb01nishes in the Slopestlye. We\nalso stole the show at the Red Bull\n1976 Winter Olympics Games revival,\nwhere dark horse Will performed a\nback-\ufb02ip on blades, securing the team\n3rd place for \u2018initiative\u2019. The national-level standard meant that competition\nwas incredibly \ufb01erce, and though we\ndidn\u2019t place in the racing this year, we\nhad a strong turnout and hope to build\non the progress that race captain MiFresh powder in the Arcs\nchael has been tirelessly working for at\nnext year\u2019s event.\nAs the rest of the week raced by, acquaintances became friends; tomato\npasta was usurped by meat/cheese\nfondue; snowploughing skis became\nparallel; library-induced pale faces\nwere replaced by peeling goggle tans/\nburns; and ridiculous quotes became\nin-jokes (cue \u2018I\u2019m so horned out like\u2019).\nBefore we knew it, we were scrubbing away the last beer stains from\nour rooms and reluctantly dragging\nour sweat and snow-drenched luggage\nback to the bus. The journey home\nwas a subdued a\ufb00air, though fortunately certain emotional group members managed to hold back previously\nshed tears for the sad inevitability of\nleaving the mountains. We will be\nback next year, les Alpes: absence only\nmakes the heart grow fonder.\nLizzy Griffiths Sports Writer Ross Henrys\nToby Marshman\nRoss Henrys\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTime to tie up Bowie\nFRIDAY 03 MAY 13\navid Bowie is more than\njust pop star. He is a\nmulti-instrumentalist,\nartist, mime artist, ac-tor, lyricist, poet and\nrecord producer. Drawing on all sectors of the art world and modern life\nfor inspiration, his intellectual songs\nand \ufb02amboyant image combine the\nfamiliar and the alien and have become stitched into the fabric of contemporary culture. He is not just one\nman, but at least \ufb01ve; from Major Tom\nto the Thin White Duke, Bowie has\ncontinuously reinvented himself with\nglorious eccentricity. His sensational\ncareer is currently being celebrated at\nthe V&A by exhibiting the \ufb01rst David\nBowie retrospective.\nThe exhibition has the appearance\nof a labyrinth, with walls adorned\nwith sketches, hand-written lyrics,\nphotographs and other artefacts\nfrom Bowie\u2019s career. As a Brixton art\nstudent, David Robert Jones aspired\nto be a pop star, yet felt restricted by\nthe lack of ambition from the members of his various jazz bands. He\ntoiled with the idea that it would be\neasier to pretend to be someone else,\nand influenced by the mine artist\nLindsay Kemp, one of the most theatrical pop stars the world has ever\nseen came into existence. His first\nhit Space Oddity is a fine example of\nBowie\u2019s ability to tap into a cultural\nfascination, intuitively releasing this\nsingle in 1969, before the moon-landing.\nBack in the exhibition, around the\ncorner, the stage is set for the illustrious glam rocker from Mars, Ziggy\nStardust, Bowie\u2019s most recognizable\nalter ego. A mannequin wears one\nof his gorgeous quilted jumpsuits\nby Freddie Burretti. This suit is inspired by the \u2018ready for action\u2019 look\nof the droogs\u2019 uniforms from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange.\nYet, to distance this costume from\nultraviolence of the gang members,\nit is made from colourful and heavily\npatterned, floral fabric. Wearing this\nbizarre suit, with his red hair, red\nboots and mismatched eyes, Bowie\nreally did look like he was not from\nthis planet. The backdrop shows\nfootage of his first appearance on\nTop of the Pops, as Ziggy Stardust\nAnd The Spiders From Mars who\ndebut with the eponymous Starman.\nIn addition to music and image,\nhis over-confident persona was un-precedented. During the same performance he put his arm around his\nguitarist Mick Ronson. At a time,\nwhen homosexuality had only recently been legalized, this was a very\ndaring move and abides with his ideology of \u2018be whoever you want to be.\u2019\nThe exhibit encompasses sixty of\nthe most flamboyant costumes I have\never seen. Image and persona are of\nthe upmost importance to Bowie, so\nhe was heavily involved in the design of each outfit, aswell as album\nartwork and stage sets. The avant-garde and vibrant style of Japanese\ndesigner Kansai Yamamoto perfectly\ncomplemented Bowie\u2019s theatrical\npersona. He created the lavish ensembles for the 1973 Aladdin Sane\ntour; a cape adorned with the kanji\nletters for \u201cone who spits out words\nin a fiery manner\u201d, a knitted asymmetric bodysuit, and the most eccentric \u2018Rites of Spring\u2019 costume of\nblack and white striped vinyl, which\nopens the exhibition.\nOther key costumes on display\ninclude the wonderful Union Jacket\ncoat by Alexander McQueen, Thin\nWhite Duke ensembles by Ola Hudson and a number of skinny suits\nwith boxy shoulders to accentuate\nhis tiny figure.\nTruth be told, Bowie is as wonderful at acting as he is at singing and\nsong-writing. To commemorate\nsome of the fascinating characters\nhe has played, a miniature cinema\nis in place, projecting clips of him\nin action. The diversity of his roles\nis impressive; from the antagonistic\nJareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth\n(1986), to the inventor Nikola Telsa\nin The Prestige (2006). In 1980-81,\nhe also starred in the Broadway production of The Elephant Man, in\nwhich he used his ability to mimic\nvoices to portray Joseph Merrick\u2019s\nfacial deformity simply through his\nmanner of speech.\nWithin the depths of the V&A, the\nlabyrinth opens up into a huge exhibition space, with projections of\nBowie\u2019s live shows against the walls.\nThe most magical of these shows\nwas the final song Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Suicide of the Aladdin Sane tour at the\nHammersmith Apollo. When he\nannounces that \u2018this is final show\nwe\u2019ll ever do\u2019, before killing off Ziggy\nStardust. Bowie seems more like an\nomniscient deity, than a man, calling down: \u201cGimme your hand cause\nyou\u2019re wonderful.\u201d\nEvidence of Bowie\u2019s immense influence can be seen everywhere in\nthe music, fashion, theatre and art\nworld. His love of the bizarre and\nencouragement to express yourself\nfreely is so universaly appealing. It is\nnot difficult to comprehend how he\nhas risen to a god-like status within\nour contemporary culture.\nDavid Bowie is run at the V&A until\nAugust 2013. Tickets: \u00a314 (conces-sions available)\nJemma Pilcher visits the shrine of a pop deity\nD\nBerlin walls\nhave years\nMeredith Thomas Arts Editor\nBerlin is a city that weeps with history.\nDecades after uni\ufb01cation it has a skyline\nlike a broken jaw. Buildings conspicuous\nby their absence are found next to bullet riddled vestiges of the Wiemar years.\nSoviet space-age architectural excesses\nand grim utilitarian atrocities now sit\nalongside shining glass temples to modern capitalism.\nThe city boasts a gunmetal solid art\nheritage, or be it a timeline with gaping\nholes; resulting from the creative repression of National Socialism and later\nsoviet communism. Yet, the years after\nuni\ufb01cation saw a catastrophic explosion\nof creative activities. Gra\ufb03ti became\npermanently associated with the fall of\nthe Berlin wall and the subsequent character of the city.\nThis rich and terrible past drew LeoSoc\u2019s annual tour to the city over Easter. Berlin did not disappoint. The group\nfound the city smothered in a thick\nblanket of snow lending a frigid, oppressive atmosphere our explorations.\nThe city and its troubled past and\npresent were re\ufb02ected again and again.\nA gra\ufb03ti artist explained the contemporary battles between Turkish immigrants and skinhead gangs, between\nthe relentless march of gentri\ufb01cation\nand anarchist squatters, all played out\non walls through slogan and counter-slogan.\nDas Berlinische Galerie featured the\ntortured attempts of censored artists in\nthe 30s to protest. Das Neues Museum\nrebuild from a bombed out shell displayed the Egyptian antiquities acquired\nduring Germany\u2019s colonial past.\nWe saw bulldozers poised to puncture\na preserved section of the Berlin wall\n(Eastside Gallery) to allow road access\nfor a media company\u2019s new o\ufb03ces.

He fought\nalien robots, \ufb02ew o\ufb00 a nuclear bomb\nout of the earth\u2019s atmosphere, and\nquite literally came back from the\ndead. And yet here is another sequel\nin which Stark is really, really about\nto meet his match. Every superhero\n\ufb01lm promises somewhat of an upgrade when it comes to antagonists,\ninventing one badass villain after\nanother. Here the billionaire playboy\nphilanthropist squares o\ufb00 against an\narmy of \ufb01re-breathing (yes, really),\nexplosive human bombs who also\nhave the ability to regenerate.\nSu\ufb00ering from post-traumatic\nstress disorder after saving the world\nby rescuing New York City, Stark is\nsolely focused on his work, ie making\nmore and more Iron Man suits (these\nall come in very handy later), an unhealthy obsessive behaviour that has\nhis loyal girlfriend Pepper Potts (Pal-trow) worried. But soon they\u2019re both\ngiven something to worry about as\nStark\u2019s arrogant, philandering past\ncatches up with him. Both international terrorist the Mandarin (King-sley) and genius inventor Aldrich\nKillian (Pearce) seem to be gunning\nfor his downfall, and in a spectacular\nscene that really does hit the screen\nquite suddenly, Tony Stark\u2019s coast-house is no more.\nStuck at a complete loss both in\nterms of resources (Stark puts together his very own low-budget suit\nusing supplies from a convenience\nstore, which contributes to one of the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s best scenes) and spirits, we see\nStark reach rock bottom which sets\nthings up nicely for chronicling how\nhe gets back up on his feet. But instead we become stuck with a clumsily written jargon-full script that\nwould have suited a police procedural more than anything else, of how\nStark puts the conspiracy pieces to-gether. The trouble is, the overall plot\nis no way near as complex as it thinks\nit is, and instead of focusing on Stark\nhimself, the \ufb01lm is too preoccupied\nin juggling the large ensemble cast\nthat really could have lost a couple of\ncharacters.\nAmong the wasted are Cheadle, as\nTony\u2019s trusted friend inside the Pentagon, who only sporadically shines\ntowards the end; Hall, Stark\u2019s ex-conquest who has troubling information on her boss Killian, although ultimately serving very little purpose,\nwhich is almost an insult to just how\ntalented Hall is as an actress; Dale\nseems to have fun with his pure-evil,\npsychotic villain\u2019s sidekick role, even\nthough he too, is given a quick, anti-climatic write-o\ufb00.\nPart of what made Iron Man so\npopular in the \ufb01rst place was down\nto Downey Jr. himself and that he\u2019s\nstill in the central role is still worth\nthe entrance price alone. He\u2019s still got\nthe cool, suave and intelligent sides\nintact, as are his lighter, humourous\nquips. He is given more to explore\nhere, most notably the superhero\u2019s\nobvious vulnerability that surfaces.\nAnd whilst in the previous two installments he had Paltrow\u2019s sassy\nCEO to exchange banter with, here\nhe spends most of his time paired up\nwith a kid (Simpkins) who likes to\ninvent a few things of his own. The\ndynamic and chemistry aren\u2019t quite\nas fun as when Downey Jr. was with\nPaltrow, but the boy opens up an interesting angle for Tony Stark to relate to, and who doesn\u2019t like seeing\nhis snarky comments aimed at an innocent boy?\nThe two main villains have plenty\nof time to shine, with Pearce and\nKingsley more than apt for their\nroles. Pearce, having a strange knack\nfor playing over the top villainous\nroles (Lawless, Prometheus) and still\ncoming o\ufb00 rather well with very little or no embarrassment at all, once\nagain repeats his forte here as a man\nwith a personal vendetta against\nStark himself. But the real highlight\nis no doubt Kingsley: and to reveal\ntoo much of his character would be\nto ruin him role altogether \u2013 but all\nthat can safely be said is that he\u2019s not\nat all who you think he is. And it\u2019s\nKingsley with his mighty talent that\nactually provides the most laughs\nwith his hysterical character. Never\nbefore have we seen someone like\nthis in a superhero movie wanting to\nbe taken semi-seriously, but his involvement certainly elevates the enjoyment factor of the \ufb01lm in the most\nunexpected way.\nAs with any \u201cPart Threes\u201d, the director does go overboard with all the\naction scenes \u2013 they have to be big-ger, louder and more bombastic than\nthey were. The explosions here are\ncertainly those things, but doesn\u2019t\nmake them any more enjoyable in any\nsense. They appear more chaotic, and\nin shambles, which is why no longer\nhow much they stretch on for, there\nis little fun to be had overall. But as\na \ufb01nale bonus, a certain actress is\ngiven a rare chance to shine in a brief\naction \ufb02ash, only to have her entire\nscene undermined by how quickly\neverything wraps up with a lazy\nvoiceover.\nHaving already amassed an amazing total of almost $200 million in a\nsingle weekend in the international\nmarket, audiences are clearly still\ninterested in whatever story Stark\nhas to tell. He has fared well even before the rest of the Avengers entered\nthe picture, although the quality of\nhis latest outing shows otherwise.\nDowney Jr.\u2019s contract is reportedly up\nafter this third \ufb01lm. Let\u2019s pray, for the\nsake of Tony Stark\u2019s future, that he\nsigns up for as many sequels as possible \u2013 as whatever the \ufb01lm\u2019s quality is,\nwe can be sure of one thing: Downey\nJr. will always be on top of his game.\n\n"

A glance at College\nsocial media pages also demonstrates\nthe fury of some of the public who have\nfully supported the BUAV campaign\nagainst Imperial and sport anti-animal\ntesting banners.\nImperial has released an o\ufb03cial responsetotheallegations:\u201c...Onlyasmall\npercentage of medical and biological research involves the use of animals. That\npart remains vital, however, to further\nthe development of treatments or cures\nfor medical conditions that blight or destroy the lives of humans \u2013 and animals.\nImperial College\u2019s policy on the use of\nanimals in research is that animals may\nonly be used in research programmes\nwhere their use is shown to be essential.\nScientists and sta\ufb00 at Imperial work\nhard to ensure that animals are kept\nand cared for using the highest standards of husbandry, thereby causing\nleast pain or distress.\u201d College has also\ncommissioned an independent investigation into the allegations chaired by\nProfessor Steve Brown, Director of the\nMRC Mammalian Genetics Unit, Harwell which describes itself as \u201cAn international centre for mouse genetics\u201d\n.\nThe BUAV have claimed that the MRC\nfund research at Imperial and that this\ncould a\ufb00ect the independence of the\nreview. Professor Brown is an advocate\nwere clearly in breach of their licences.\nThe use of live animals in scienti\ufb01c\nexperimentation is regulated by the\n1986 Animals (Scienti\ufb01c Procedures)\nAct. The act (which has recently been\nrevised to accommodate the European\nDirective 2010/63/EU on the Protection of Animals Used for Scienti\ufb01c\nPurposes) declares that an individual\ncannot use a regulated procedure on\nan animal unless they have a personal\nlicense, a project license and are carrying out their experiment in a licensed\ninstitution. The licences are provided\nby the Home O\ufb03ce, which enforces the\nact and sets the limits of each project\naccording to its categorised severity.\nHowever, the BUAV are claiming that\nthe video footage shows Imperial researchers who do not understand the\nlimits of the licence and that others\nwilfully disregard their licence, causing\nfurther pain and su\ufb00ering to their test\nsubjects.\nImperial is not the \ufb01rst university that\nhas been investigated by the BUAV, in\n1998 a ten-month undercover investigation into the use of marmosets was\n\ufb01lmed and released publicly in 2002.\nAt the time the university in question\n(which was not Imperial) was not legally charged with any misdeeds however\nit was noted that at least one project\nlicence had been exceeded and a later\ncourt found that the Home Secretary\nhad miscategorised the severity of the\nexperiment licence.\nRegardless of the allegations of neglect and abuse of the animals under\ntheir care, the video footage does raise\nquestions concerning how College approaches the training of new researchers experimenting on animals and how\nactive College\u2019s animal welfare o\ufb03cers\nare in spotting and reporting dangers\nto animal safety. This media coverage\nfor the use of mice in medical research\nand sees mouse as a way of discovering\nthe connection between genetics and\ndisease in humans, with whom mice\nhave 99% of DNA in common. Imperial has also alerted the Home O\ufb03ce\nto the BUAV allegations and has contacted all College sta\ufb00 with personal or\nproject licences and reminded them of\nImperial\u2019s policies on animal welfare in\nlaboratories.\nWhile Imperial has responded to the\nallegations the BUAV is still petitioning\nfor the removal of College\u2019s establishment licence for the use of live animals\nin research. Frustrated with College\u2019s\ndecision to ask Professor Brown to head\nan investigation the BUAV and their\nsupporters (including Imperial graduate Brian May) are also petitioning for\na \u2018wholly independent\u2019 inquiry into the\nallegations and possibly the wider implications of the animal testing licensing system in place. The BUAV have\ndelivered a letter to the Home O\ufb03ce,\nwhich was signed by MPs from all par-ties, calling for an enquiry that is independent of Imperial, the Home O\ufb03ce,\nand any institution funding or supporting research there.\nHow Imperial\u2019s teaching and research\nwill be a\ufb00ected by the upcoming investigation is yet to be understood however the allegations have certainly brought\nideas concerning animal testing back\ninto the mainstream community.\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nSummer is approaching and at Imperial this means internships, work and\nUROP\u2026 but not for the Project Nepal\nteam.

Don\u2019t get me wrong\nIt\u2019s not that I have anything against\nexperimental ejaculation per se, hell\nI think it\u2019s kind of hot. However, it\ndid strike me as pretty unorthodox\ncoming from someone I\u2019d only met a\ncouple of times. What if I\u2019d been a de-mure, reserved kind of girl, who only\nenjoyed missionary and spooning?\nAnd whilst I think it\u2019s fair to assume\nthat I don\u2019t exactly exude timid wall\ufb02ower, the question remains: what\nmade this guy think it was okay to\nmake such a request?\nFast forward a couple of weeks later,\nI met up with a guy from my past \u2013 I\nwasn\u2019t sure what to expect; there had\nalways been \ufb02irtation between us but\nit had never led anywhere. However,\nplied with wine and nostalgia and\nhaving missed the last tube home,\nwe both knew what was going to go\ndown. The sex itself was a combination of the non-committalness of a\none night stand with comforting familiarity of long standing a\ufb00ection \u2013\nIt wasn\u2019t mind blowing but pleasant\nenough all the same. From a purely\nclinical standpoint, it was a pretty\nstandard shag, no crazy karma-sutra\nC\ninspired moves or kinky add-ons but\nagain as he reached climax the same\nrequest was made!\nNow the object of this article is not\nto describe the pros and cons of cum-ming-on-tits. Whilst I realise some\nwomen (maybe even most women)\nwould consider an act of this nature\ndegrading or humiliating, I liked it.\nThe bottom line is I loved the fact they\nboth had the balls to ask for what they\nwanted, it was a massive turn on. And\nthis lead me to thinking, generally,\nwhy aren\u2019t we more vocal about our\nsexual desires?\nCome on ladies, let\u2019s be honest\nwe\u2019ve all faked an orgasm or at the\nvery least feigned more enthusiasm\nthan we felt. Personally, I don\u2019t have\nenough digits to count the number of\ntimes I thought to myself \u2013 \u2018I wish he\nwould just...\u2019 but then decided to bite\nmy tongue. The worst has to be when\nyou\u2019re faced with inevitable post-coi-tal \u2018was that good for you?\u2019 \u2013 How do\nyou break it to someone that no, three\nminutes of missionary did not rock\nyour world?\nSex (or at least good sex) tends to\nfall into two categories; emotional sex\nand hedonistic sex. Emotional sex is\nwhen the act is underpinned by emotional attachment \u2013 what some people\nchose to call making love (vom). Conversely, hedonistic sex is sex for sex\u2019s\nsake and is largely con\ufb01ned to physical\ngrati\ufb01cation and immediate sensory\npleasures.\nHowever in both cases it seems absurd not to be direct about what you\nenjoy. If it\u2019s emotional sex, you should\nfeel close enough to the person to be\ncandid about your sexual desires. If it\u2019s\nhedonistic sex, ultimately you should\nboth be out to maximise pleasure and\nas a result be equally vocal. So why is\nit that so many of us feel too ashamed\nor shy to ask for what we want?\nIn light of these recent musings, I\u2019ve\npledged to be transparent about my\nsexual likes and dislikes. I now make a\npoint of asking what my partner likes\nand then make some suggestions as to\nwhat might enjoy. So far this approach\nyielded highly satisfying results. Like\nso many things in life, it seems sex is\nvery much a matter of \u2018if you don\u2019t ask\nyou don\u2019t get\u2019\nHaving said that, maybe it\u2019s just\nsomething about the way I act that\nmakes guys think I want them to jizz\nall over me. Not sure.\n\u201d\nHow do you\nbreak it to\nsomeone\nthat no, three\nminutes of\nmissionary\ndid not rock\nyour world?\nMy favourite things about exams\n\u201c\nAnonymous\nt\u2019s that time of year again:\nwith the joy of the excessive\nchocolate consumption that is\nEaster comes The Fear. Exams\nare just round the corner and\nyou suddenly realise you haven\u2019t been\nto an entire week of lectures since October.\nHowever, I was once told that every\ncloud has a silver lining. And here is\nthat lining for exam season:\n1) Money Saving Opportunity: I\nmean, between the days you spend\nforming an intense relationship with\nthe view of Queen\u2019s Tower from the\n4th \ufb02oor of Central Library and the\nnights having panic-attacks and contests with your \ufb02atmates about who\u2019s\ndone the least work, when do you\nphysically have any time to spend\nI\nmoney? You\u2019ll only spend money on\ncomfort food from the Library caf\u00e9\nand unnecessary stationary from the\nUnion Shop, and in no time you\u2019ll resent both of those places so much you\nwon\u2019t be able to pull your money from\nyour pocket (because your \ufb01sts are\nclenched with revision rage).\n2) Reduction of Embarrassing Encounters: During exams, alcohol\nconsumption either plummets or es-calates. If it plummets, I \ufb01nd myself\nexponentially less likely to wake up\nbeside someone and having to sheepishly smile whilst I gather my clothing and mutter something about how\n*cough* great a time I had. And if it\nescalates, well, the revision-induced\nmisery means I\u2019ll be a guilt-ridden,\ncrying wreck by half past ten and\nthat\u2019s never attractive. No one wants\nto go home with that person, so job\ndone: I will wake up in my own bed,\nsimilarly sheepish as I recall my breakdown but free to enjoy the embarrassment alone.\n3) New Hobbies and Discoveries:\nSince the dawn of education, one of\nthe best things about revision are the\nnew things you end up discovering\nwhilst you frantically procrastinate\nand avoid the stacks of notes in front\nof you (your very own mini-Everest,\ncourtesy of our darling Imperial).\nThese things range from your new secret talent, or simply a fantastic inter-net-revelation. For instance, yesterday\nI spent an hour and a half with my \ufb02uid mechanics open in front of me but\nwatching a documentary on Beyonce\n\u2013 it was the best hour and half of my\nlife. I also caught three M&Ms and\none Malteser in my mouth by throwing them in the air \u2013 this is unprecedented and all thanks to my exams.\nSo whether you discover Maru the Cat\non YouTube, create a Twitter account\nor simply \ufb01nd that you can cross all\nof your \ufb01ngers and toes at once, don\u2019t\nforget: none of this would have been\nmade possible without serious denial.\nTHANK YOU EXAMS.\n\n"

Really, you\u2019re going with that\nas the simile there? Isn\u2019t there a\nload better things to say than that\nsurely? You really would think that\nbefore recording this and putting\nit out there you would stop, listen,\nand realise it\u2019s going to make you\nsound like a massive nerd.\nImmortal Technique:\n\u201cHarlem Renaissance\u201d\nDo people laugh at you all the\ntime?\nReally?\nWell you\u2019re probably funny\n(looking).\nAnyway... Send stuff in: felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\nSnapshat\nPhotos you will get\n1. Various in-jokes from your friends.\nMost likely just the \ufb01rst thing they see\nwhen they\u2019re bored.\n2. Strange, awkward attempted \ufb02irts.\nOf course there will also be the creepy\nguy who sends you some weird, \ufb02irty\nmessages that are completely unwant-ed. Much like an unwanted Facebook\ninbox message, it\u2019s a cautious game\npretending that you didn\u2019t see any\nphotos from people you don\u2019t want to\ntalk to. The secret to Facebook by the\nway is stealth. If you just put on a well\nplace email noti\ufb01cation, you can read\nit in your emails and then draft a reply.\nThen, when you send it, it looks like\nyou\u2019ve just managed to come up with\nsome witty o\ufb00 the cu\ufb00 remark, when\nreally it\u2019s a carefully honed, thought-out message. Secret to Snapchat: \u201cOh,\nshit, yeah, I must have been distracted\nand didn\u2019t see that photo of how hairy\nyour knee is.\n3. Photos at about 1am from a drunk\nfriend that you know de\ufb01nitely now\nfancies you. Think of it as basically\na step above drunk texting. As if it\nneeded to get any worse, now you\nsend a photo. Oh well, at least the evidence deletes itself after being brie\ufb02y\nimprinted on your retina.\n4. A classic \u201cme with my mouth open\nwith a penis crudely drawn onto the\npicture\u201d. Inventive.\n5. Very soon, probably, some kind of\nspam. Along the lines of \u201cdate people\nnow! Singles in your area.\u201d\n6. An irritating amount of sel\ufb01es.\nHopefully without the arm still in\nshot.\n7. None that you think: wow, I really\nwish this was on Facebook so I could\nsee it again and again...\nPhotos you probably won\u2019t\nget\n1. Any form of actual sexting. No really you probably won\u2019t. In fact, a\nstudy of 1 trillion people found that\n0.0000000000000000000000001%\nof all photos sent are actually people stripping o\ufb00. Of these\n0.000000000000001% were women.\nEssentially, it\u2019s like one of those dating\nagencies that says that it is in trouble\nas there are \u201ctoo many sexy singles\ndesperate for a date in your area\u201d. Most\nof the naked photos were men sending it to their mate as a joke. Admittedly, this study was just entirely made\nup on the spot just now, but the point\nstill completely stands 100%. No, wait:\n1000%.\nAnyway, what would even be the\npoint. By the time you\u2019ve unzipped\nyour \ufb02ies your snap has already been\ndeleted. Unless you have some kind of\nsuperhuman masturbatory technique\n(which, as you are at Imperial let\u2019s assume you probably do/will develop\nover the exam season) you\u2019re probably\ngoing to be a bit slower than about 10\nseconds. If you want to do that why\nnot just use the regular webcam? If\nthey are also making themselves a bit\nmore comfortable it\u2019ll be pretty hard\nto actually \ufb01lm you (as is presumably\nyour worry). The morale of the story:\njust use a webcam people. So much\neasier.\nEveryone uses wishes they used Snapchat for sexting\nYou just send a quick photo of yourself and it appears for a few seconds then deletes. Amazing! Nothing can go wrong! Except if someone just takes a photo of their screen as you have no way of knowing\nthey did that and no way of deleting the photo. Well, now you\u2019re paranoid, read the photos you will and\nprobably won\u2019t receive on Snapchat.\nIf Einstein were a student today he\u2019d probably be sending this to all the Physics LADS. And, of course, the classic torso shot.\nGreat selfie here\nWiley: \u201cHeatwave\u201d\n\u201cI wanna see an ice cream van on\nthe road\u201d\nWhat are you ten? That\u2019s definitely\nnot gangsta to want to see an ice\ncream van, unless it\u2019s some amazingly convoluted terminology that\nactually somehow means something selling drugs. It\u2019s not though.\nYou just want a 99p, which probably costs like \u00a31.20 nowadays.\nFucking inflation.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFRIDAY 03 MAY\n13 & ICStartup: just the start\nreativity. When you enter school, the ultimate\nprice you are paying\nis not the tuition fees,\nbut your unique expe-riences, revolutionary\nideas and well \u201cstupid thoughts\u201d. By\nproviding standard education, our\nworld is able to put us in nice boxes,\ngood to manage and move around.\nHowever, we should not forget man\ndid not create a wheel because he\nwent to the school of wheels or harness electricity because he was the\nbest student of physics. Man did\nwhat he did because of its creative\ninventiveness, rebellious ideas and\nimagination.\nAt the beginning of the year Imperial Innovations launched the Venture Catalyst Challenge \u201813 (VCC)\nas part of the student business accelerator ICStartup. Over 100 successful applicants spent the next two\nmonths developing their very early\nstage ideas into viable businesses via\na series of sessions focused around\nthe Business Model Canvas.\nICStartup decided to challenge\nImperial students to put their best\nideas to down to practice in its Venture Catalyst Challenge \u201913. The\nformat was simple: write an idea,\ndevelop a business model, pitch it to\na panel of known entrepreneurs and\nbusiness people and get the chance\nof winning from \u00a3500 to \u00a330.000\npounds to develop a working pro-totype. From the initial period of\nregistration in early January to the\nbig finale on the 14th of March, 200\nteams of students put their brains\nto work coming up with ideas as\nelaborate as a satellite vehicle and as\nsimple as...oh wait, this is Imperial \u2013\nnone of the ideas were simple.\nDuring the 6 week period ICStarup\nprovided free business Masterclasses from Lean expert Rob Fitzpatrick,\nwho advised students how to turn an\ninitial idea into a feasible business\nmodel. Rob Fitzpatrick also brought\nin thought leaders and founders including Devin Hunt, Tom Samadol,\nDaniel Tenner and Jordan Schlipf. In\naddition, optional sessions ranged\nfrom finding appropriate financing to delivering the perfect pitch\nto idea generation sessions, startup\nweekends, hackathons and inspirational talks from start-up CEOs.\nThe event reached its peak at the\nGrand Finale, where 7 finalist teams\ngave their Dragon\u2019s Den style pitch\nto an audience of over 150 people,\nincluding investors from Index Ventures, Hoxton Ventures, Opus Corporate Finance, Arts Alliance and\nBethnal Green Ventures, as well representatives from the department\nfor Business Innovation and Skills\nand the Dean of the faculty of Engineering at Imperial.\nEntries in the Innovate category\nranged from a consumer device for\nfiltering lactose from milk (62% of\nthe global population is lactose in-tolerant) to safe nuclear powered\nbatteries that can last for years. Entries in the Prove category included\nlab equipment that can remotely\nalert the scientist at specific stages\nof experiments, style deliveries for\nmen, an API to allow developers to\nadd real world rewards to their apps,\ncloud based practice management\nsoftware for dentists and the overall\nwinner ClickMechanic which takes\nthe stress out of car repairs with upfront quotes and mobile mechanics.\nClickMechanic received \u00a330,000 in\nthe form of a convertible loan, office\nspace and a mentor to guide them\nthrough the summer. Winners in the\nInnovate category received between\n\u00a3500 and \u00a31000 to test the market or\nbuild an initial prototype with more\navailable upon positive traction.\nThe awards ceronomy was followed by the usual \u201cdisruptive\u201d and\nindependent debates of some satis-fied, drowsy and slightly alcohol-ised last surviving participants and\nfriends.\nAs Rob Fitzpatrick so eloquently\nput it in is final speech, most of the\ntimes people will not have all the\nskills to put their ideas to practice.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t matter. You\ncan learn hat you need to know\nalong the way. Getting out there and\njust making a start on something is\nall you really need to make it hap-pen! His suggestion: host a \u201cburger\nnight\u201d for people who are interested\nin enterprise! Meet people, share\nideas and make it happen!\nBe \u2018stupid\u2019 again!\nPedro Silva Pereira Writer\nC\nWhat\u2019s next for ICStartup?\nICStartup is planning to build upon\nthe success of the Venture Catalyst\nChallenge \u201813 and deliver bigger, better and more exciting events next year.\nIt\u2019s clear that this is a great time to\nget involved in the start-up community but if you still need a little more\nconvincing about why to give it a go\nthen read on for our \u201ctop 10 reasons\nto throw your books on the floor, storm\nout of the library and start your own\nbuisness.\n\u201d\n10 great reasons to throw your books on the floor, storm out of\nthe library and start your own business\n1. You\u2019ll get to hangout in Shoreditch and switch the library cafe for cute independent coffee shops\n2. Bill Gates did it\n3. When people ask you what you do you can legitimately say \u201cI\u2019m my own boss\u201d And that\u2019s swag\n4. Suddenly your geeky technical skills will become sexy\n5. NO. MORE. INTERNSHIP. APPLICATIONS.\n6. You\u2019ll meet cool people and make great new friends\n7. You\u2019ll learn something more relavent to real life than the half-life of thorium-232 or the momentum of particle z\n8. You can work on something you love. All day. Every day.\n9.
