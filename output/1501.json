    "content": "It\u2019s an unusual setting for Capdown\u2019s\nfinal gig, skin heads and punks looking\nincredibly out of place in the theatrical\ngrandeur of KOKO. For years these\nveterans of the UK ska scene (and perhaps the only good thing ever to come\nout of Milton Keynes) have toured the\ncountry\u2019s basements, only now, at the\nend, getting the recognition and large\nscale venues they deserve.\nUp and coming stars of UK scene,\nThe Skints provide an excellent\nwarm up set, throwing in numerous\nclassic ska tracks among their own\nEast London reggae stylings. Here is\na band certainly fit to takeover where\nCapdown leave off but in my eyes it\u2019s\nall about the headliners tonight.\nFinally at 9pm Capdown storm the\nstage, a single opening sax riff setting\nthe crowd in immediate motion. They\nmay have returned from hiatus but the\nCapdown\nKOKO\nNovember 6, 2011\nCapitalist downfall\nband who famously played over 250\ngigs in a year have clearly lost none of\ntheir live edge.\nUnsurprisingly (and much to the\ncrowd\u2019s delight), older tracks such as\n\u2018Ska Wars\u2019 and \u2018Cousin Cleotis\u2019 form\nthe majority of the set but even tunes\nfrom the lesser acclaimed \u2018Wind Up\nToys\u2019 album get a final seeing off, still\ngenerating roars from the crowd and\nsizeable circle pits.\nAs you would expect from a last\ngig, crowd interaction is top priority\nand vocalist Jake does not disappoint,\nat one point splitting the crowd and\nmaking his way into the middle before\ndisappearing amongst a horde of fans\nfrom both sides of a charging wall of\ndeath.\nWhen it\u2019s all over genuine sadness\nappears to take over the crowd, the final gig of a band I grew up with is certainly momentous. Then again I was\nthere at home in MK for the previous\n\u2018last ever\u2019 gig. I\u2019ll always have my\nfingers crossed. Caution: angles may induce torticollis\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nReal Estate\nDays\n2011\nIt was cold this morning, wasn\u2019t it? Like most stu-dents, myself included, you\u2019re probably a bit suspicious of the thermostat and slightly paranoid that\nif you turn the heating on your next gas bill will be\nenough to bankrupt you. (I\u2019m not talking about you,\n\u201c1%\u201d students; you know who you are\u2026)\nThe summer is dead and we\u2019re quickly approaching those days where you get to the library before\nit\u2019s light and leave well after the pathetic sun has\nscuttled off in fear of the overwhelming dark.\nBut there is some hope in the face of this November malaise; Real Estate\u2019s second album, Days.\nIt\u2019s happy in a rueful sense; a chilled out, surfer-rock ode to the summer that\u2019s stopped answering\nour calls. It washes over you with simple, wandering lyrics about the kind of love that only really exists in nostalgic hindsight (preferably while wearing\nchunky black hipster glasses\u2026)\nAdmittedly the album doesn\u2019t require a lot of hard\nwork to get into it. But as much as music snobs\nwant to believe that all the best albums require \u201crepeat listens\u201d, Days works just as well in the background as it does when you need music to tease\nout feelings that you can\u2019t otherwise verbalize.\nIf you\u2019re feeling cold this week and need a cuddle,\ntweet me @kadhimshubber. A better idea would be\nto tweet @BritishGas and say, \u201cDude, it\u2019s like cold\nand shit.

In just over a decade\nthey\u2019ve established themselves as one of the leading independent record labels in the UK. Founders\nRobert Luis and Paul Jonas have always had a keen\near for talented artists who mix styles from jazz and\nsoul, to house and techno, to calypso and salsa.\nNext Saturday, Tru Thoughts are taking over\nKOKO and bringing with them the finest artists on\ntheir roster. The globe-trotting record store-fiend\nQuantic will be DJiing (expect records that God\nhimself doesn\u2019t know exist...) and Nostalgia 77\nand Belleruche will also be gracing the stage.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 11\nFRIDAY 11 november 2011\nMore resignations in\nthe Eurozone\nThe socialist Prime Minister of Greece,\nGeorge Papandreou, finally made a deal\nwith opposition conservatives for a unity government and acceptance of the European bailout deal, in exchange for him\nstanding down. His previous decision\nto call a referendum on the deal, which\ncaused rapid decline in markets and anger from other European leaders and opposition parties in Greece, was scrapped.\nSo far, the parliament has failed to agree\non a new prime minister and general\nelections are likely to be held in February. Reaction from papers throughout\nthe European Union and Greece was\ngenerally positive, though cautious, but\npopular protest action shows no sign of\nwaning in Greek cities.\nMeanwhile, in Italy, Prime Minister\nSilvio Berlusconi promised to resign\nin the near future. He finally bowed\nto pressure from many of his former\nallies in the Italian media and by the\nhead of his main coalition partner,\nUmberto Bossi. Many are still,\nhowever, sceptical of his sincerity.\nThe markets, in particular, have not\nshown much faith, with Italian bond\nyields remaining at a damaging high\nof 7.5%. Like Greece, the Italian\ngovernment is coming under pressure\nto form a unity coalition and accept\na reform package from the European\nUnion. Mr Berlusconi has so far\nrefused a major bailout plan despite\nItalian debt standing at 120% GDP. To\nmake matters worse, with the majority\nof this debt being held by private\ninstitutions within Italy itself,\nthe 50% debt \u2018haircut\u2019\nGreece received from its\ncreditors may not be\nhelpful in Italy.\nMore land\nwars in\nAsia\nA report to\nthe UN by the\nInternational\nAtomic Energy\nAgency found\nthat Iran is\nlikely to not only\nbe developing\ncomputer models,\nbut also testing key\ncomponents for a\nnuclear arsenal including\nwarheads. The Supreme\nLeader, Ayatollah Khamenei,\nissued a fatwa against such weapons\nin 2005 and President Ahmadinejad\nhas said his country does not need the\nweapons. Despite this, rumours are\ncirculating of a full scale war. Israel\nthis week tested ballistic missiles with\nenough range to reach Iran, though Iran\nalso possesses such weapons. The Daily\nMail claimed that a plan drawn up by\nDavid\nC a m e r o n and Barack\nObama, the leaders of Britain and the\nUnited States, involved an invasion on\ntwo fronts \u2013 from Iraq in the West and\nAfghanistan in the East. The President\nof France, Nicholas Sarkozy, denied\nsuch plans existed, though both he and\nChina condemned Iran\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d\nwith nuclear weapons. China,\nhowever, continues to sell non-atomic weapons to Iran, and\nWestern diplomats have\ntold The Telegraph\nthat they expect\nChina and Russia\nto veto any\nnew sanctions\np r o p o s e d\nat the UN.\nBritain, the\nUS, France,\nChina and\nRussia make\nup the veto-h o l d i n g\npermanent\nm e m b e r s\nof the UN\u2019s\nS e c u r i t y\nCouncil and all\npossess nuclear\nweapons. Israel\nmay also have\nnuclear weapons ,\nthough refuses to admit it.\nDespite agreeing to a\ndiplomatic ceasefire deal, the\nPresident of Syria, Bassar Al-Assad,\nhas continued the military campaign\nagainst militants, with particularly\nbrutal attacks on the city of Homs,\nthough he continues to deny this. The\nArab League, who negotiated the deal,\ncondemned his actions. The protests,\nwhich started in the spring, initially\nRajat Jain\ninvolved unarmed protesters continuing\nto face military gunfire. With Western\npowers showing no zeal for a Libyastyle intervention and Al-Assad refusing\nto negotiate, the rebellion is becoming\nincreasingly militant. It is thought that\nSyria could be heading for a civil war.\nAl-Assad has continued to claim that\nthe rebels are \u201cterrorists\u201d supplied with\nweapons by secretive foreign powers\ntrying to destroy Syria.\nMore Presidential\nGaffes\nThe Presidents of the United States and\nFrance were overheard insulting the\nPrime Minister of Israel. Discussing the\nFrench decision to support Palestine\u2019s\nmembership to UNESCO, Sarkozy said\n\u201cI cannot stand [Netanyahu]\u2026 he\u2019s a\nliar\u201d to which Obama replied \u201cYou\u2019re\nfed up with him? I have to deal with\nhim every day.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu\nhas been rumoured to be a particularly\nunpopular Israeli leader among Western\nleaders, refusing to negotiate on giving\nup East Jerusalem or stopping the\nbuilding of illegal settlements.\nThe Republican frontrunner for the\npresident of the United States, Herman\nCain, claimed China does not have any\nnuclear weapons in an interview on\nPBS. Despite being a strong candidate\non domestic issues, there are concerns\nthat his understanding of foreign policy\nis rather limited.\nA couple of weeks ago, at the\nCommonwealth summit in Perth,\nthe sixteen leaders of countries\nwhere Elizabeth II is head of state\nunanimously agreed to change the\nsuccession laws to give women equal\npriority as men. This means should the\nDuke and Duchess of Cambridge (aka\nWills and Kate) have a daughter before\nany sons, she will be eligible for the\nthrone before her younger brothers.\nIt will also allow any monarch, or\nanyone else in the succession line, to\nmarry a Catholic without losing their\nright to the throne. A retroactive clause\nhas been added to prevent hundreds\nof pretenders to the throne from\nemerging.\nNick Clegg, the \u2018highly regarded\u2019\ndeputy Prime Minister, was in charge\nof negotiations with other states and\ndescribed the previous system as\n\u201cold fashioned\u201d, saying we need to\nmove with the times. David Cameron\nechoed this describing it as \u201coutdated\nand wrong\u201d. He, however, made it\nclear that in their role as protector of\nthe Church of England, they must be\nAnglican but can marry whoever they\nlike. This move, though seemingly an\nobvious one in the modern world, is a\nterrible idea.\nYou see, the existence of the\nmonarchy in Britain is rather difficult\nto understand. There are benefits\nto a House of Commons that is not\nproportional (for the sake of having\nyour own MP representing you\nregardless of whether you share a\nparty), as well as an unelected House\nof Lords (a non-populist house of the\nwise to improve legislation), but the\nRoyal Family is bewildering. If we\nwant to move with the times, shouldn\u2019t\nwe do away with the monarchy and\nelect a president? Should we not also\nhave full separation of Church and\nState? It is beyond belief that Nick\nClegg could describe the House of\nLords as outdated and push for it to\nbe fully elected, yet see the changes\nin succession as somehow progressive\nand radical.\nThe problem is that these views\nare driven by ideology. While the\nconcepts seem good and pure, they are\nnot practical. The oft cited reason for\nkeeping the monarchy, alongside many\nother British quirks, is stability. Unlike\nmost of our European neighbours,\nBritain has maintained a stable\ngovernment for hundreds of years. This\nhas largely been achieved on a simple\nprinciple: if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nThe British public demonstrated this\nbasic belief when they voted against\nthe Alternative Vote. Given that the\nmonarchy is operating without any\nproblem, this is a dangerous move that\nthreatens to destabilise Britannia. I am\nnot being sexist or anti-Catholic, but\nthis law will open the door for changes\nto be made to the fundamental structure\nof our government on populist whims.\nFor the sake of Britain, it should be\nstopped.\nLong live a Queen\nMaintaining a misogynist monarchy\nflickr/incurable_hippie\nNot willing to say anything incriminatory \u2013 so here\u2019s a picture of the Queen\nPolitics Editors: Joseph Letts\nRajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMaking a poster produces 100g of CO2\n; telling your friends about going green is almost carbon free \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 11 NOVEMber 2011 17\nA\nfter reading the \u2018Heaven\nof hell\u2019 article from two\nweeks back, and reading\na bit of Christian perspective on the subject in last\nweek\u2019s edition, I decided to shed some\nlight on the subject from a Muslim\u2019s point\nof view. As well as writing on the general\nimportance of religion within a society.\nI think it is safe to assume that the life\nafter death debate is an argument that has\nforever been a part of human existence\nand will continue to do so. Needless to say,\nwe humans, with our highly specialised\nbrains and much-expanded frontal lobes,\nnaturally incorporate rationality and logic\nin our daily lives and decisions. No matter\nhow scientifically developed, intellectually refined, and culturally civilised we may\nbecome, each one of us at some point in\ntheir life is confronted by a series of spiritual questions: What is the purpose of life?\nWhy are we here on Earth? Is there really a\nGod?And so forth. Often ignored and seldom encouraged to think about, I believe\nthe way a person goes about tackling these\nquestions does shape his/her life. Each one\nof us wants to be successful. However,\nsuccess is relative and we each define it in\nour own ways. It is based on this definition\nthat we draw up our principles, prioritise\nour commitments, and come up with our\nindividual philosophies of life.\nI wouldn\u2019t want to delve too deep into\nAnum Farooq\nUmair Aasem\nThe journey through nature\nOn the flip side of the coin\nthe concept of heaven in Islam over here,\nas any attempt to do so would be futile.\nThe only way a person can begin to understand and appreciate heaven is by having a\nstrong grounding in the belief in God. Imposition never works with human beings.\nWe need to be intellectually convinced\nand thoroughly satisfied before accepting\nan argument. It is because of this rationale\nthat the Quran constantly appeals to reason\nand encourages man to ponder, reflect and\nseek knowledge.\n\u201cThere are indeed signs for men of understanding\u201d \u2013 Quran\nIt is only when one is convinced of the\nattributes of God and his supreme knowledge that things begin to make more sense.\nIn Islam, there are no mediators, no secret\nincantations, and no Popes. The ordinary\nman communicates directly with God and\nmoves at his own pace. There is no coercion in religion. It is only when we get to\ngrips with God\u2019s quality of being \u2018unimaginable\u2019, that the seemingly daunting idea\nof an eternal afterlife becomes not only\nmore acceptable, but something to crave\nfor and look forward to.\nAnyhow, I would like to use this opportunity to argue against \u2018The Heaven of\nHell\u2019 article\u2019s point of view that: \u201cLiving\nlife as if there is nothing more to come is\nsurely the most fulfilling and productive\nway to live\u201d. For me, simply put, religion\nis what gives life\u2026 to life.\nH\now many moments have\nyou actually lived? Or\nreflected upon, or marvelled\u2026 or just, been?\nNow, this is not some kind\nof hippy wisdom, this is an understanding\nof the world around us. Have you ever ran\nthrough rain puddles on a sunny day and\nseen a rainbow at your side? It might seem\ncomical, but try it, and then we\u2019ll see who\nis smiling. Tennyson personifies nature as\nan eagle:\nHe clasps the crag with crooked hands;\nClose to the sun in lonely lands,\nRing\u2019d with the azure world, he stands.\nThe wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\nAs a fifteen year old studying this poem,\nI was captivated, so much so that I began\ndreaming. Dreaming of exploring nature\nand being lost in the wonderland, and\nthrough travel I have attempted to fulfill\nthis dream. Really though, what I was\nsearching for was always around me, right\nfrom the day I was born.\nTry this: stop. Right now. What do you\nsee? Zoom out. Look at the big picture,\nat the patterns that emerge. Zoom in, and\nsee if they are still present. Now, take a\nmoment and look outside, outside of your-self, outside a window. Just spend a minute looking and you will notice something\nyou have never seen before or thought\nabout. See life unraveling before you.\nIn the mad rush that is our lives, time is\na luxury. Paradoxically, the more we have\nto get done, the more efficient we become,\nand a good dose of adrenaline helps pump\nus through the day.\nAs a bachelorette, I run on a 12-hour\nday: work and countless chores multi-tasking. I teach, and so despite the lack\nof time, with a stern but tantrum like ten-dency, there is always time for nature, despite staying back for detentions! The mix\nof adrenaline and nature is enjoyable. Or\nmaybe, I just need to get a life.\nOften, it is as simple as just hopping\nthrough the park, and chucking bread at\nthe birds and finding it funny to chase the\nducks. Of course, avoiding dogs (put them\non a leash darling). As an undergradu-ate, occasionally my pilgrimage to Hyde\nPark consisted of walking all around the\nlake, stopping at the bridge and just being stunned at the ecosystem before me.\nSitting under trees to reflect for a while is\nnormal, my friends tell me it must be tree\ndampness, not dog wee, where I happen to\nsit. I believe them.\nExploring greenery is not unlike Enid\nBlyton\u2019s (yes, old skool!) descriptions.\nAs a teenager, I used to cycle in the Lee\nValley and my God, that was truly an incredible experience. There are these paths\nswamped with willows, hollies, ivies,\nbushes, trees of all sorts. The path winds\nthrough them, eventually coming to the\nmarsh lakes and the canals, with the sky\nspreading endlessly before.\nForests are those magical places where\nevery type of weather is an adventure. In\nautumn, you can run over the crunchy fall\nleaves and the branches with closed eyes.\nThere are the emerging snowdrops in win-ter. And the tree climbing scrapes in sum-mer. Spring, of course, spring, when all of\nnature is in its element, actually add your\nown description here.\nWaterfalls, valleys and mountains and\nthe eco-kaleidoscope are not mere de-scriptions, but realities and reflections to\nreach out to, to explore and make connections with. Would it be fair to say, as\nBeing raised up in Pakistan, I realise that\nreligion is a bit of a taboo subject here in\nthe west. People generally tend to steer\nclear of the subject and questions such as\n\u2018what is your religion?\u2019or \u2018what is the purpose of your existence?\u2019are met with awkward silences. I believe removing God and\nreligion from a society creates a crippling\nvacuum,whichhasunsurprisinglyevolved\nto give rise to a materialistic and avaricious culture. Happiness and satisfaction\nare considered to be directly proportional\nto fame and wealth, and understandably\nso. If this is the only life to live for and\nmoney is what makes the world tick, then\nit\u2019s not a mystery as to what my purpose in\nlife would and should be. Rise in immorality is a direct consequence, as morality\nand religion have always complemented\neach other. The obvious imbalance between body and soul leaves a person with\na feeling of emptiness and consequently\nincreases psychological problems within\nthe society as people look for peace else-where. Family life suffers and the rising\nsuicide rates, drug abuse, crime rates and\ndivorce rates only go on further to drill the\npoint home.\nBelief in God is what truly liberates man\nand allows him to reach his full potential.\nHe submits to no one but God. Man is liberated from man when he realises that life\nand death and respect and humiliation are\nGod\u2019s jurisdiction. Once a person learns to\novercome his fears, and breaks through his\nself-imposed prisons such as narcissism,\nmaterialism, pride, people\u2019s opinions (and\nin today\u2019s age even growing old!), it is\nonly then that his life transforms, because\nfearlessness is what breeds idealism and\nany person who\u2019s ever achieved greatness\nin this world has always been an idealist\nand aimed beyond his imagination.\nFaith is what encourages all that is\ngood within a person and enhances both\nthe individual as well as the community.\nIt invigorates his will power and allows\nhim to dominate material desires, rather\nthan be dominated by them. And I finish\nthis article with a quote from a great philosopher and poet from medieval India, Sir\nMuhammadAllama Iqbal:\n\u201cIn servitude, it is reduced to an almost\nwaterless stream, but in freedom, life is a\nboundless ocean.\u201d\nwe age, that our only horizon was the\nexpansive urban dis-utopia with shots of\nadrenaline?\nEven if, even if, we have no time to\nstand and stare. Why not actually observe your daily journey, your commute,\nthe path you\u2019re walking on. Here\u2019s a\nchallenge, take a moment out every day\nin your \u2018normal\u2019 routine, to stop and see\nthe nature surrounding you and just learn\nsomething. Every single day.\nPerhaps. I\u2019m just a wannabe hippy\nthinker; the passion for nature is an innate\ntendency. My biological mother used to\nput me under trees as a baby, as some sort\nof experiment. I guess the connection was\nmade, with the family of trees. Nature, it\nseems, knows how to look after its own.\nThe whispers of nature echo\u2026through\ndusk and dawn\nIn the fields there is nothing but to run\nwith the butterflies\nIn the family of nature\nLaughing at the whooshing wind\nAs the orange coloured sky turns to pink\nto navy\nIt only takes a moment to realise\nThe transience of life\n\u201d\nBelief in God is\nwhat truly liberates\nman and allows\nhim to reach his full\npotential. He submits\nto no one but God.\n\u201c\nBelief in\nBelief in\nwhat tru\nwhat tru\n\u201d\nJust spend a minute\nlooking and you will\nnotice something\nyou have never seen\nbefore\n\u201c\nJust spe\nJust spe\nlooking\nlooking\n\u201d\nThe ordinary man\ncommunicates\ndirectly with God and\nmoves at his own\npace ... no coercion.\n\u201c\nThe ordi\nThe ordi\ncommun\ncommun\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 11 november 2011 15\nIt seems that Wikileaks haven\u2019t got round to telling you, so we\u2019ll have to.\nThe views expressed are the opinions of the authors, not Felix.\n\u201d\nD\non\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I take\nmy hat off to anyone who\ncan fashion a new idea,\nstart a business, and successfully market it. But,\ndespite this admiration (they\u2019d be quick\nto call it envy), entrepreneurs are the most\ninsufferable people that have ever talked at\n(rather than to) me.\nWhether they\u2019re Silicon Valley start-ups\nor working-from-home parents, today\u2019s\nsort of entrepreneur (who\u2019ve come out in\ndroves since the financial crisis) all share\none thing in common: an unabashed, smug\nelitism, placing themselves above the salaried peons. Their derision of the employed\nhas become formulaic and rote, and I guarantee that any interview or blog post you\nfind with one will have one of the following clich\u00e9s.\nThe first one appears most frequently\namong those whose work involves spreading their own opinions: authors, bloggers,\nwebcomic artists, journalists and the rest.\nThey parrot the message of hard work\n(after all, they wouldn\u2019t have got where\nthey are today without it) as the only key\nto success. I can see you frowning and\nthinking, \u201cbut they\u2019re right \u2013 hard work is\nnecessary!\u201d Of course it is, but what these\nbraggart entrepreneurs fail to realise is that\nthere\u2019s another component just as important in success: luck.\nThe successful may have worked very\nhard for it, but how many who worked\njust as hard are left behind? After all, you\ndon\u2019t really think you\u2019re here because of\nhow good yourA-level grades are, do you?\nEvery musician bumped up to fame, each\nSamuel Furse\nKeir Little\nThe death of Bad Science\nWhy I hate entrepreneurs\nblogger who talks about the amount of\nhours they\u2019ve hustled, the countless developers of one-hit-wonder smartphone apps:\nthey all love to assure us that anyone could\ndo what they did with enough hard work.\nIn reality? The numbers suggest other-wise: studies show that 8 out of 10 start-up\nbusinesses fail in the first three years. It\u2019s\nhardtogetanaccuratefigureforhowmany\nmanuscripts become published books, but\nan optimistic estimate would be around 1\nin 1000. This, of course, is not considering the people who have great ideas but\ndue to money, family or other hardships,\ncan\u2019t even find the time to work on them.\nSo, entrepreneurs, I\u2019m happy that you\u2019ve\nreached the top. But how many bodies did\nyou climb over on your way there?\nNext, there\u2019s the childhood story. The\nentrepreneur probably didn\u2019t do well in\nschool \u2013 not because they\u2019re unintelligent,\nyou understand, but because the system\njust isn\u2019t for them. They got by through\ncheating, stealing or plain blagging and,\neven worse, are willing to boast about this.\nAfterall,inasocietygearedtocreatemindless drone workers, these are skills that\nentrepreneurs need. Why bother learning\nmaths when you can hire someone to do it\nall for you?\nIn their spare time, they were already\npractising their sales pitches. Everyone\nhas a story. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I\u2019d paint\nsnails\u2019shells and sell them to the other kids\nat school.When I noticed the red ones were\nmore popular, I painted all of them red.\nWould you believe it? I already understood\nfashion at the age of 7!\u201d or \u201cwhen I was\nan adorable 5 year old with curly blonde\nB\nad Science is dead. It has\nfallen off its bench. It has\ngone to meet its supervisor.\nIt is an ex-science. Sadly, I\nam not talking about a humane rounding-up of charlatans, quacks,\nhomoeopathists, and people who like to\ncompete as to who has the best imaginary\nfriend. I am talking about Ben Goldacre\u2019s\ncolumn in The Guardian.\nIsthistheendofactivelyexposingdodgy\npractice that would otherwise be passed off\nas science? Fortunately, not quite. Prof David Colquhoun (the pipe-smoking, tweed-wearing, chair in Pharmacology at UCL)\nis still going strong, so all is not lost. We\nmay even get Dr Goldacre back; he has\nstopped for now at least to finish a book.\nNevertheless, it seems likely that he needs\na rest from having a well-thought-out go at\npeople who can, and do, dupe morons out\nof their cash. And of course there are only\nso many times one can say that homoeopa-thy is bollocks before it is just repetition. I\nhope that this sort of analysis will continue\nthough, and for two reasons.\nFirst, it is a bit of a confidence-giver to\nthe rest of us. Despite being as incensed\nas the next man, at the rubbish that is presented to us as good or healthy when it is\nnot, I still cannot quite bring myself to say\nso some times.Afew weeks ago I got chatting to a girlfriend of a friend of a friend.\nShe is an astrologer. Needless to say, part\nof me wanted to run from the room. Apart\nabout the same size wanted to tear her to\npieces. And if she had not been an astrolo-ger, another part of me\u2026 well, let\u2019s not go\nthere. She disassociated herself quite early\non from newspaper astrologers \u2013 \u201cbecause\nthey are talking rubbish, obviously\u201d. \u201cObviously\u201d I agreed, with just a hint of ironic\ntone. I let her chunter on about the position\nof planets and moons and stars, throwing\nin questions as she went on. I got more ir-ritated, so the questions built up in a kind\nof viva-ing way. Despite my mounting annoyance that there are actually people who\nspend their lives messing around with this\ndross, the most damning I could be was to\nask why the position of Saturn on the day\nof a person\u2019s birth was more important to\na child\u2019s life than the difference between a\nparent who was loving, absent or a violent\nmentalist. She did not give a coherent an-swer. The upside to what I did is that I do\nnot think I offended her, but the downside\nis that I do not think she knows what she\nis doing is drivel any more than she did\nbefore. So was my behaviour weak and\ndisingenuous, or gentle and unflinching?\nCertainly I am not afraid of asking difficult\nquestions, and having people, like Goldacre and Colquhoun, who are prepared to\nsay publicly that a spade is a spade, does\nmake it easier for me.\nSecond, I think that public analysis of\nthis sort of thing will keep science in check.\nI am not going to talk about science as a\npure entity that must be protected against\nall odds. This is because it is better than\nthat; it is useful and effective.Also, I would\nlocks, I\u2019d go from door to door in my\nneighbourhood selling hand-made cards.\nEveryone bought one. Even then, I knew\nthe value of making high-quality goods.\u201d\nIt\u2019s sickening. Can you imagine a singer\nsaying, \u201cas a baby, I\u2019d grab a pen and\npretend it was a microphone. I must have\njust been destined to sing my entire life!\u201d?\nWhen I was a child, I\u2019d eat wax crayons.\nClearly, my interest in long-chained hydrocarbons at such a tender age was what led\nme to study chemistry, right?\nFinally, there\u2019s the call to arms. \u201cYou too\ncan cast off the shackles of your desk job,\nput your fingers up at the 40-hour week\nand chase your dreams!\u201d Entrepreneurs\nseem to think that being employed is little\nbetter than being a slave. Granted, many\npeople do feel this way, but there are a fair\nfew who (would you believe it?) actually\nenjoy their jobs.There\u2019s even more who do\nvital work, which can only be performed\nas part of a company. With a childlike un-be hypocritical if I did call science a pure\nthing, the rough translation of homoeopa-thy is \u2018retaining purity\u2019, based on the translations we use of homeostasis and patheno-genesis. Worse still, I think that an attitude\nof reverence would be in serious danger\nof making science into a sort of pseudo-religion. Can you imagine anything worse?\nProfessors would become like Bishops,\nColleges and Universities like cathedrals\nand anyone with a PhD would be automatically trusted in the way that anyone with a\ndog collar is now.\nAnd that is the nub of it. The point of\nscience and the way it is different from\nreligion and charlatanism is that nothing\nis automatic. Of course, \u2018career\u2019 scientists\nhave to build a reputation and produce solid work, but if they are worth their salt they\nshould never mind being asked questions.\nDifficult questions. The question now is,\nwill science retain this sobriety, or will it\nbe superseded in the way that organised\nreligion has?\nEntrepreneurs\nseem to think that\nbeing employed is\nlittle better than\nbeing a slave.\n\u201c\nEntrepr\nEntrepr\nseem to\nseem to\nderstanding of businesses and economics,\nentrepreneurs sweep all of this under the\nrug.

    "content": "A\nny of you who read my article\nlast week probably came to the\nconclusion that I\u2019m either a dribbling moron or an actual full-on\nnutter. For that exact reason, I\u2019ve\ndecided to simmer things down a bit and tell\nyou about possibly the most peaceful thing I\ncan imagine: an all acoustic gig on a boat gently\nrocking on the Thames.\nThis was a strange experience for me, not\nonly because it was on a boat (www.tamesis\ndock.co.uk) but because normally acoustic music isn\u2019t something I buy into. I usually find it\u2019s\nsomething I want to hear so little that if it ever\ncomes on I wish my head would literally just be\nengulfed. This was different.\nFirst on was Tangled Hair. Usually a three-piece, this time frontman Alan Welsh dropped\nhis band-mates for a solo performance.\nDespite complaining of a sore throat, he did\nan amazing job delivering his unique style of\nlight-hearted rhythmic indie math-pop with soft\nmelodic vocals as brilliant as ever. Initially apprehensive of whether the music would work\nacoustically after being so mesmerised by the\nfull band, I was pleasantly surprised at how well\nWelsh conveyed the songs with just an old guitar and his vocal chords.\nWelsh finished up and put down the guitar.\nA tramp then strolled through the crowd and\napproached the microphone. The tramp began\nto serenade us but not in the usual tramp style\nSt Giles in the Fields, a church in Soho, is not\nthe most conventional musical venue, but its\nlarge, echoing space perfectly suited Grouper\u2019s\nrecognisable brand of ethereal ambient pop.\nHaving seen her previously performing the\nstunning tape collage Rolling Gate, I wasn\u2019t\nsure what to expect from this gig \u2013 Rolling Gate\nhad no recognisable tracks or structure, merely\nconsisting of small changes in a wall of fuzz.\nThis was a much more conventional affair,\nusing guitar, piano, and of course, a lot of tape\nloops.\nGrouper opened the set with favourites\nthrough a range of her albums, caressing the\naudience into relaxation with her ghostly quiet\n(substituting a guitar for an old, smashed-in\npiece of wood). This was an actual, real-life,\nnot-mentally-disturbing tramp.\nSomething wasn\u2019t right \u2013 there\u2019s no such\nthing as an undisturbing tramp serenade. Then,\nthrough the mass of facial hair, I realised this\nwas no vagrant, it was of course Tobias Hayes\nof Shoes And Socks Off.\nA truly inspirational musician, he was a\nperfect follow up to Tangled Hair with his\n\u201cstubbed-toe blues\u201d. His songs, depressing yet\naddictive, are so well-written that its hard to\nnot be in awe as you watch this unassuming\nhero.\nFinally, Dad Rocks! came onstage. The\nbeer/boat combo had taken its toll on me but\n\u201cThe tramp began to serenade us, but not in the\nusual tramp style.\u201d\nAs with many of its cultural exports, Japan\u2019s punk\nis a little different. Epitomised by bands such\nas the percussion-heavy Boredoms, the metal-heavy Boris, and psychedelic OOIOO, its brand\nof noise-rock tempers avant-garde intensity with\nkitschy dollops of fun.\nFastest, sharpest and strangest of the lot,\nthough, is Melt-Banana, who play what might as\nwell be cartoon music at three times the intended speed. Melt-Banana are a four-piece, but they\ndo without a proper drummer, the drum stool\noccupied in a kind of hot-desking arrangment.\nSinger Yasuko Onuki, guitarist Ichirou Agata, and\nbass player Rika Hamamoto make up the band\u2019s\nsound, each given equal prominence in the insane onslaught.\nImagine a soundtrack to The Itchy & Scratchy\nShow scored for pneumatic drills and laserguns,\nplayed on fast-forward and interspersed with\nsound-effects from a bullet-hell shooter. Except\nall those pew-pew noises are coming out of the\nguitar amps. It\u2019s not a surprise to learn that Agata converts euphoric melodies that come to him\nwhile playing video games into guitar riffs \u2013 ap-parently, the Tony Hawk skate-boarding series is\nparticularly good at getting him going.\nMelt-Banana have been prolific since the core\nband came together in Tokyo in 1992, releasing\nten albums and 20+ EPs, most of them put out\ninternationally through A-Zap, a label they started themselves. But it\u2019s their live shows that have\nmade them legends. The band spring and jerk\nabout the stage like perpetual-motion Jacks for\nan entire set, ripping relentlessly through dozens\nof songs, few more than a minute long. There\u2019s\noften a popular interlude where they play through\na bunch of 10-second songs, each followed by a\npolitely yelped \u201cThank you!\u201d to the audience.\nStill, awesome as Melt-Banana are, not everyone likes to sprinkle shichimi on their udon, so\nlet\u2019s end with a nod to Shonen Knife, a pop-punk\ngirl band formed in Osaka in the 1980s. Sticklers\nfor the DIY approach, they eschewed the J-Pop\nfashion and modelled themselves instead on the\nBuzzcocks and Ramones.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 9\nFriday 11 NOVEMBER 2011\nPhysicists are proposing an experiment that will require the world\u2019s most\npowerful laser. The Extreme Light\nInfrastructure (ELI) Ultra-High Field\nFacility is touted to produce a laser so\npowerful that it would be able to pull\ntogether the fabric of space, vacuums.\nA vacuum is generally believed to be\na volume of space that contains no mat-ter. The gaseous pressure of a vacuum\nis typically much less than atmospheric\npressure, leaving it essentially empty\nof matter. A perfect vacuum with no\nparticles in it at all, however, is virtually impossible to achieve in practice.\nVacuums are said to be permeated\nwith extremely small particles of matter and antimatter known as ghost par-ticles, which are shrouded with mystery and pop in and out of existence\nso fast that no-one has been able to\nprove that they exist. The experiment\ninvolves combining ten lasers to generate a super-laser which will then create\nan intense electrical field separating\nthe ghost particles. This will prevent\nthem from annihilating long enough to\nbe detected.\nScientists believe this will also allow\nthem to gain further insight into extra\ndimensions. Professor John Collier,\ndirector of the Central Laser Facility\nat the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire and a leader of the\nELI project, said that \u201cthis laser will\nbe 200 times more powerful than the\nmost powerful lasers that currently ex-ist. At this kind of intensity we start\nto get into unexplored territory as it is\nan area of physics that we have never\nbeen before.\u201d\nIt is difficult to deny the existence of\nclimate change when one points out the\nobvious effects it has already made on\nhumanity. Coastal flooding, reduced\nrainfall in dry lands and water scarcity\nare common headlines in today\u2019s news.\nAmong the many effects that these phenomena may have, let us consider that\nof human migration.\nIn recent times human migration has\nnot been given the best of reputations,\nwith various nations enforcing policies\ndesigned to prevent it. However, experts\nhave dared to suggest that migration in the\nface of environmental change may offer\nopportunities as well as challenges.\nMany people across the globe already\nmigrate for various reasons: to improve\nincomes, to escape persecution, to join\nfamily members, and to avoid environmental or other threats. Reports show\nthat environmental factors are increasingly influencing migration. Moving to\nurban areas has become a common coping strategy in the face of flooding in\ncountries such as Bangladesh. However,\nit may not come as a surprise that not\neveryone is able to migrate due to sociopolitical or economical factors. Conversely, it has also been found that people are as likely to migrate into places\nof environmental vulnerability as away\nfrom them. This decision is most often\nan ignorant one, where rapidly growing\nmegacities that are considered areas of\nhigh flood risk, in coastal regions in Africa or Asia for example, continue to see\nnew arrivals by the millions.\nIt is obvious that there are many interlinked factors involved in the movement of people across the globe. The\npoint that academics are trying to stress\nis that migration may be the best plan\nof action for many people in the face\nof environmental change that threatens\ntheir livelihoods. To aide these attempts\nat survival it is necessary that countries\nacknowledge this fact and remove restrictions on movement as well as help\nbuild channels for it.\nInternational policy makers should\nconsider mechanisms for funding adaption to climate change through migra-tion. Particular focus should be made\nto populations in low-income countries\nthat are moving to or are trapped in\nurban areas that are vulnerable to environmental change. These priorities\nshould be integrated in current plans for\nsustainable urbanisation, climate-smart\ndevelopment, conflict resolution and\nemergency preparedness. In addition,\nexperts highlight a need for flood-con-trol, water management, forecasting and\nwarning capacities for growing urban\npopulations. Other suggestions include\nthe appointment of migrant communities to demographic deficits and labour\nshortages in potential host countries.\nA basic infrastructure is key to ease\nthe relocation and settlement of these\nmigrant populations in urban areas. As\nan increasing amount of attention is being paid to humanity\u2019s influence on the\nenvironment, we must take care to respond accordingly to the impact of environmental change on both migrant and\nnon-migrant communities.\nDOI:10.1038/456877a\nKatherine Portilla\nTearing apart the vacuum\nThe reality of migration\nComputer imitates human brain\nDespite computer processors being able\nto operate at speeds of up to ten thousand billion (1013\n) bits per second they\nare outperformed in many tasks by the\nhuman brain, the neurons of which fire\na mere thousand or so times a second.\nThis is because modern machines are\nonly cable of so-called \u2018serial bit-processing\u2019; meaning that calculations only\noccur one at a time. Each neuron in the\nbrain, on the other hand, can communicate with up to a thousand others each\ntime it fires, allowing for a great degree\nof parallel calculation.\nLast year, however, scientists from the\nJapanese National Institutes for Materials Science and ICT as well as Michigan\nTechnological University brought us\none step closer to creating a computer\nwhich replicates the functionality of the\nbrain by laying down an array of three\nhundred 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) molecules on a\ngold substrate. Each molecule can exist in any one of four electrically conducting states, which are initially set\nby applying a voltage using the tip of\nscanning tunnelling microscope, and\ncan connect with up to six neighbouring\nmolecules. In a recently published article the team of scientists call this \u2018oneto-many interaction at a time\u2019 \u2013 similar\nto that found in neurons.\nThe system therefore forms a Cellular Automaton, a concept developed\nby the famed mathematician John von\nNeumann.

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX Friday 11 november 2011 33\nEuropean success for Imperial at iGEM\nThe iGEM (international Genetically\nEngineered Machine) competition is run\nevery year with hundreds of teams from\nall over the world competing for the top\nprize in synthetic biology \u2013 a shiny piece\nof glass. It is now in its eighth year running and bigger than ever before, with\nthe grand finale at MIT now preceded\nby three regionals in Europe, Asia and\nAmerica. The objective of the competition is to essentially engineer bacteria\nto do something awesome \u2013 find land\nmines, produce fiery luminescence, you\nname it.\nWe were but lowly undergraduates\nwhen we signed up to be part of this\nyear\u2019s Imperial iGEM team but can now\neasily be identified by a lack of personal\ngrooming usually observed exclusively\nin the late stages of PhD thesis writing,\nand if you are unfortunate enough to\ncatch one of us in a bar you will likely\nbe subjected to a rant about Gibson assembly (it never works, man) or BioBrick standards (it\u2019s pointless, man). But\nI digress.\nOur team of biologists, biochemists\nand bioengineers started out enthusiastically (and maybe a tiny bit naively) in\nearly July, when we brainstormed for\nideas on how to engineer microbes to do\nsomething awesome. After two weeks\nof coming up with concepts that ranged\nfrom feasible to completely wacky, we\nfinally found the project of our dreams:\nAuxIn. Named after the phytohormone\nauxin, the project does what the title\nsays: we engineered E. coli to produce\nindole 3-acetic acid, a type of auxin that\nenhances plant root growth. We were\ninterested in expressing this hormone\nas it makes plants grow highly branched\nroots that can be used for holding down\ntop soil in areas prone to soil erosion and\ndesertification.\nOnce we had settled on a project, we\nRebekka Bauer jumped straight into the \u201chuman practices\u201d component of our idea. We talked\nto ecologists, plant scientists, social scientists from LSE, charity founders and\na Greenpeace scientific advisor to make\nsure that our project was viable and\ncould be implemented in a sensible way.\nThis led us to design Gene Guard, a containment device that prevents horizontal\ngene transfer (bacteria passing on DNA\nin the envrionment). We also looked at\nhow we could implement our project in\na culturally sensitive and responsible\nway and designed a concept of using a\nseed coat to cover seeds in our bacteria,\nwhich could then be shipped to countries\nsuch as Australia and India where soil\nerosion poses a big problem.\nThe project was completed with a third\nmodule, which enables bacteria to swim\ntowards the root exudate malate to ensure that the compound reaches roots.\nAmazingly, we also found a paper published last year describing how plants\nStudent projects share at symposium\nAre you part of a student-led project\nat Imperial? Or perhaps you\u2019d like to\njoin one \u2013 or better yet, even start your\nown? No doubt you\u2019ve heard of the\nachievements of some of the College\u2019s\nmost ambitious student projects, which\ninclude e.quinox, who deliver electric\npower to rural villages in Rwanda, and\nRaincatcher Imperial, who aim to improve the availability of clean water to\nresidents in Tanzania. Such projects\nclearly have a wealth of experience and\nknowledge in implementing solutions\nthat are of benefit to the wider commu-nity.\nThe Students-Led Projects Symposium (SPS) aims to bring these societies together under one room, such\nthat they can meet with each other and\nbenefit from each other\u2019s experiences.\nJointly organised by both Imperial College London and Loughborough University students, the event provide an\noptimum interactive environment for\nkeynote speakers, representatives from\nthe Union and the societies to network\nand exchange their thoughts and ideas\non student-led projects. In the words\nof Merwin Man, who came up with\nthe idea of the symposium in the first\nplace, \u2018the purpose of the conference\nis to create a community to encourage\nknowledge transfer between student-led\nprojects and its members, something\nthat does not exist in a functioning form\nat Imperial College\u2019. He believes that\nby encouraging student projects to share\ntheir opinions and experiences on what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t, they will develop a better understanding of the steps\nthey can take in order to successfully\nmeet their goals. He also hopes that the\nsymposium will inspire other students to\nget involved in one of the most rewarding aspects of student-life.\nThe SPS, which is due to happen on\n16th November 2011, will be a national\nevent held at Imperial College London,\nwith students from universities around\nthe UK coming down to participate in\nthe symposium. This event aims to bring\nJames Chia\nthese projects together and give recognition to the endeavours of students who\nhave already started using their skills for\nthe benefit of the wider community. By\nsharing their ideas and presenting their\nwork to the public and other students,\nthe SPS focuses on encouraging and\ndeveloping current and new student-led initiatives. The symposium kicks\noff with panel discussions that involve\nrepresentatives from the Union and the\nsocieties themselves, who will discuss\nhow they went about starting their proj-ects, and how they are run today.\nEarlier this year, Imperial College\nLondon saw its first Global Citizenship\nSymposium (GCS), a symposium of a\nFrom e.quinox to Raincatcher Imperial; students gather to discuss their experiences\nsimilar nature, held at a smaller scale\nand targeted at Imperial College stu-dents. The discussions revolved around\nthe ever-important issue of money, with\nan emphasis on raising funds, and at\nhow the Union and CAG can support the\nstudent\u2019s idea or project. Simon Moss,\nthe co-founder of the Global Poverty\nProject, who has spoken at prominent\nconferences in the past, including G20\nand WEF summits, was invited to the\nsymposium to give a presentation to the\nGCS.\nThe SPS will be beneficial for anyone\nwith an interest in student-led projects,\nas well as to students currently involved\nin their own projects. \u201cThe symposium\nwill let us know what other projects exist and what they do,\u201d says Karen Ng of\nRobogals, who encourage girls at school\nto take a greater interest in science and\ntechnology. \u201cIt will help us develop\nour own and others\u2019 project, whilst\nalso enabling us to give more back to\nthe student community and to our supporters!\u201d As places are limited, prompt\nregistration at the website below is rec-ommended, with the event promising to\nbe a stimulating overview of student-led\nprojects at Imperial College London,\nLoughborough University and others.\nNovember 16 2011 \u2013 go to www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/cag/symposium to register for free.\nare able to break down their own cell\nwalls and eat bacteria \u2013 a great platform\nfor modifying plants without directly engineering them.\nAnd then we started living in a lab\non SAF\u2019s 5th floor. Communist attitudes towards sharing lab space quickly\nmorphed into imperialist conquests for\nworking pipettes. Tempers flared, friendships were tested. However, by the end\nof the summer, we came out exhausted\nbut happy. Our bacteria produced auxin\nthat could be seen to affect plants; they\nswam towards malate and were taken up\ninto the roots and our Gene Guard module was only a week away from comple-tion. On top of that, our engineers had\ndone some amazing modelling and designed an entire website from scratch.\nWe had also presented our project at the\nNatural History Museum and set up a\nradio show around iGEM, which we are\ntold other people listen to.\nFull of good hopes, we boarded a\nplane toAmsterdam on the first weekend\nof term. With iron determination we ignored the temptation of illicit substances\nand spent our time in the hotel room\nrunning over our vital, final 20-minute\npresentation. Nervosity ran high but we\nhad our Disney movie moment when we\nwere announced as finalists and Chris\nand Nikki got up to deliver the most\namazing speech of their lives.\nThis experience could only be topped\nby what followed soon \u2013 the Imperial\niGEM team was crowned Grand Prize\nwinner in the first ever regional jambor-ree.\nHappy and tired, we flew back to London and took a few days of deserved rest.\nBut the journey is not yet over. Soon\nwe will be flying out to Boston to present\nour project again, this time competing\nagainst the top teams from Europe, Asia\nand America. We will continue to work\non our project until then and hopefully\nfind a great end to an amazing summer.\nImperial previously hosted its first Global Citizenship Symposium\n\n"

In beautifully\nvibrant slow motion, we are forced to watch\nin horror as the world, and four of its inhabit-ants, come to a startlingly abrupt end by way\nof planetary collision. Birds fall from the sky,\nhorses collapse, and our protagonist Justine (a\nsuperbly cast Dunst) floats down a river in an\nOphelia-esque fashion. As the two planets finally meet and the orchestral score pushes into\na final crescendo, you know that this is not going to be a light-hearted journey.\nThe film takes part in two halves, named after\ntwo sisters, Justine and Claire. We\u2019re introduced\non the night of Justine\u2019s extravagant wedding at\na luxuriant country house put on by her sister\u2019s\nmillionaire husband (Sutherland), which also\nappears to be approaching disaster at a similarly drawn out pace. Like a snowball gathering speed, tensions between Justine\u2019s estranged\nparents, delays, and an exceptionally overbearing boss push Justine to breaking point, and we\nare again forced to endure what essentially feels\nlike a beautiful, but devastating train crash of a\nwedding. This is heart-wrenching stuff: Dunst\nperfectly pulls off a woman who is cornered by\nthe oppressive forces of those around her and\nlongs to be left to her own devices. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to watch her recklessly destroy\nall that\u2019s been handed to her on a silver plate,\nbut you cannot help but feel a sense of sadness\nIn brief\nIt\u2019s just a jump to the left\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show is no ordinary mov-ie. The 1975 classic has a certain place in the\nhearts of many: its catchy tunes, its fantastic hu-mour, and its breath-taking but never too disturbing weirdness all add up to a unique and hilarious\nexperience.\nMy first Rocky Horror experience was as a 13-year-old, I went with a friend and his parents to\nsee it at the Wycombe Swan theatre. Not really\nknowing anything about the show, I wasn\u2019t entirely\nsure what to expect, other than that it would be\nvery funny and involved transvestites. Little was I\naware that the \u201cfancy\u201d dress extended to the audience as much as the cast members on stage, although (luckily, as I was with my friend\u2019s parents)\nnot compulsory. The audience participation adds\nso much to either a stage production or a film\nshowing, the heckling, the audience sound effects\nand the fact that everyone is completely pissed\nwhile wearing high heels and fish-nets.\nSo I\u2019m very excited that next Thursday ICU Cinema in conjunction with Musical Theatre Society\nare putting on a showing at the Union cinema.\nDoors will open at 9:15pm and the show will start\nat 9:30pm.\nTickets can be bought online, they are \u00a35 for entry and a goody bag of props. Tickets on-the-door\nare \u00a33.50 without goodies. It\u2019s sure to be a hell\nof an evening and if you\u2019re a fan of either the film\nor wearing something a little bit special for one\nevening, you\u2019ll love this.\nMatt Allinson\nForget orchestral scores, these are songs you\nwould actually listen to. Or maybe you like to\nhave the shower scene from Psycho on repeat\nduring your walk to college every morning,\nI\u2019m not here to judge.\nLayer Cake\n\u201cFucking females is for poofs.\u201d\nFrom the opening scene with FC Kahuna\u2019s\n\u2018Hayling,\u2019 you know this film\u2019s going to have\na good selection of music. Featuring recognisable songs from The Cult, Duran Duran and\nJoe Cocker, the music emphasises the exciting\nbut lonely life of the protagonist. Well worth a\nwatch, particularly if you want to perfect your\ncockney accent.\nTwilight\n\u201cAre you still faint from the run? Or was it my\nkissing expertise?\u201d\nOkay, before you spit on the page in disgust\nand set the whole paper on fire, let me explain.\nThe music is actually pretty darn good. The\nfirst three soundtracks had contributions from\nFlorence + the Machine, Bat for Lashes, The\nBlack Keys and Thom Yorke, and Muse even\nwent as far as to do a song for each OST. Who\ncares if you think Edward Cullen\u2019s a bit of a\nknob, just listen to the music.\nThe Craft\n\u201cLight as a feather, stiff as a board.\u201d\nThe \u2018How Soon Is Now?\u2019 cover may irritate\nthe traditionalists in the audience, but if you\u2019re\nlooking for a 90s throwback you\u2019ll be hard\npushed to find a better OST. \u2018All This and Nothing\u2019 and \u2018Dangerous Type\u2019 are sure to get you in\nan angsty teen mood. So girls, roll up your skirts,\npull up your socks, get out your neck chokers\nand slap on some dark lipstick \u2013 we\u2019re going\nslutty gothic gunge. With witchcraft, of course.\nReservoir Dogs\n\u201cYou keep talking like a bitch, I\u2019m gonna slap\nyou like a bitch.\u201d\nYes, the film where every character sounds\nlike a piece in Cluedo is brilliant for some\nretro tunes, something that Tarantino successfully does in each of his bloody masterpieces.\nHe mixes upbeat tracks such as \u2018Stuck in the\nMiddle with You\u2019 with horrible gore that,\nin a very disturbing way, makes you almost\nenjoy the violence. I challenge anyone after\nseeing this to walk down the street in a suit\nand NOT have the burning desire to walk in\nslow motion to \u2018Little Green Bag\u2019 playing in\ntheir head.\n(500) Days of Summer\n\u201cJust because she likes the same bizzaro crap\nyou do doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s your soul mate.\u201d\nA film that I watch over and over, despite\nhow much it irritates me. Some chilled music from Doves, Carla Bruni (who doesn\u2019t\nlove a cute French voice whisper-singing\nin your ears?) and The Temper Trap, and\nthere\u2019s a brilliant scene with sunshine and\ncartoon birds accompanied by the Hall and\nOates track \u2018You Make My Dreams.\u2019\nat her predicament.\nIt\u2019s not until the second half, Claire, where the\nfilm feels like it\u2019s really kicked into gear. Whilst\nit was heavily hinted at during the first half, Justine is now painfully immobilized by crippling\ndepression. Unable to function normally, she\nhas moved back into the same country house\nto be cared for with the aid of her sister\u2019s fam-ily, all under the gaze of Melancholia, a rogue\nplanet due for a flyby of Earth within the next\nfew days. Claire\u2019s husband\u2019s boyish sense of\nwonder at the celestial does little to install her\nwith a sense of calm at the possibility of a col-lision, whereas a rapidly recovering Justine,\nconvinced that life on Earth is evil, is longing\nfor apocalypse.\nDirector Lars von Trier has made a name for\nhimself in recent years for his half art school,\nhalf B-Movie schlock combination when it\ncomes to filmmaking, and Melancholia is no\nexception. It is shot beautifully but unsteadily,\nwith hand held camerawork adding a thick air\nof unease and tension to every scene, meaning\nevery dull wedding conversation becomes inexplicably uncomfortable. This contrast aids in\ndriving forward the dialogue, which sometimes\nappears stifling, and slows the pace.\nBut where the film really excels is the multitude of themes that it touches upon over its\nrunning time. The whole movie is built on con-trast: beauty versus horror, calm versus panic.\nThroughout the film these ideas are played off\neach other in a subtle, yet poignant style: the\nbride in her wedding dress pissing on a golf\ncourse, guests who appear dignified yet act in\nthe most despicable ways, and the encroaching\nplanet of Melancholia itself. Fundamentally\nthough, one idea remains: that you can only\ntruly know a person when they believe they are\nabout to die, and how they accept their fate is\na larger statement on who they are. And that is\nan idea that is best discussed after you\u2019ve seen\nthis film.\nWhile many will dismiss Melancholia as\npretentious and overly stifling in its revelry\nof depression (and in some cases may well be\nright about it), the fact remains that von Trier\nhas crafted a film of visual beauty that is truly\nessential viewing, even if just for the discussion\nafterwards.\nIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it\nWant to write for the film section?\nIt\u2019s easy - just send us your articles\nto film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWe are nothing, absolutely nothing,\nwithout our loyal contributors\nChristopher Dean\nDirector Lars von Trier\nScreenwriter Lars von Trier\nCast Kirsten Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg,\nKiefer Sutherland, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\nMelancholia\nFiona Calcutt\nSeriously, I have a thing for vampires - first Brad Pitt, then Tom Cruise, and now you...\nFive films to watch for their soundtracks\nMT Soc and ICU Cinema showing of The Rocky Horror Picture\nShow: Thursday 17 November\nat 9:15pm in the\nUnion Concert Hall\n\n"

They\nare the biggest, and they have the best clients.\nBut it seems that people with power have no-ticed, and the Big Four are now fighting a battle\non two fronts: on one side the Office of Fair\nTrading (OFT) have referred the Big Four to\nthe Competition Commission; on the other side,\nthe EU are having a go too. They both want the\nsame thing \u2013 to either split the four firms up\ninto smaller companies, or to set a limit on the\nnumber of clients they have.\nThe OFT doesn\u2019t seem to like the fact the\nBig 4 firms are dominating the market. With\n99 of the FTSE 100 companies being represented by the Big Four, and just 2.3% of firms\nthat have been a part of the FTSE 100 in the\nperiod 2002\u20132010 have actually changed audi-tors. They claim there is a lack of competition,\nwhich is true, to a certain extent. But the FTSE\n100 represents the 100 \u2018best\u2019 companies in the\ncountry, and they will want to be audited by\nthe \u2018best\u2019 firms of accountants. Is that an unfair\nthing to want? Can it really be said that the four\nlargest firms in an industry have an unfair majority of the market share? Perhaps if there was\njust one firm with these 99 clients this would be\nunderstandable, but when there are four firms\nbeing grouped together, the argument becomes\na bit flaky. It is like saying to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, Morrison\u2019s and Waitrose: Too\nmany people are spending their money in your\nsupermarkets; we are going to split you up.\nThe Competition Commission have the power\nthough. They have already forced BAA\u2019s hand,\nrequiring them to sell some of their airports;\nwho knows what they could do to the Big Four?\nThe EU seem to have less of an issue with the\nsupposed lack of competition in audit services,\nand more of an issue with the services the Big\nFour can offer their clients. Reuters report that\nthey have seen a draft of a law that could really\nshake up the Big Four. It proposes that the Big\nFour should be banned from offering or providing their consulting services \u2013 even worse,\nforce their consulting braches to split from the\nrest of the accountancy part of the firms.\nWe will have to wait until November to see\nwhat the implications of these laws are, but\nthe situation is looking bad for the Big Four.\nBut to use the analogy of supermarkets again,\nthese laws would be like saying to a shopper\nthat they are allowed to buy their food from\na supermarket, but not any drinks, toiletries,\nclothes or electrical goods. If some sectors are\nallowed to offer numerous services \u2018under one\nroof\u2019, then why can\u2019t others? Especially when\nthe work \u2013 audit and assurance \u2013 that the various consulting departments do are so closely\nrelated.\nIt just seems everyone is being a bit hard on\nthe Big Four. Maybe people are starting to get\nbored of picking on the banks and have moved\non to the next type of financial institution? The\narguments from the OFT and the EU seem\nflaky. Perhaps they would be understandable if\nthere was one juggernaut of a firm dominating\nthe market, but it is not one, it is four. Would\nit be such a bad thing to want to be serviced\nby the best in the business if you can afford it?\nThere is a reason why these firms have become\nso big: because they are good. Why can we not\naccept that?\nThe End of the Big Four?\n12\nArticle Rebuttal\nThe author criticises the OFT and EU decisions as \u201cflaky\u201d, but he is unjust in the\narguments he offers for saying this. First\nof all, he completely ignores the fact\nthat the accountancy and consultancy\nmarkets need not be \u2013 and definitely\nare not \u2013 the same as the retail market.\nAs the recent price war between Tesco\net al. has shown, a few players in the\nretail market will not only not collude,\nbut can actually engage in fierce competency from which the only beneficiary\nis the consumer. This is because retail\nproducts are consumed on an everyday\nbasis and it is fairly easy for the consumer to change upon finding a better\noffer. However, the market in which the\nBig Four compete is not as flexible; their\nservices are not used in a regular basis,\nand are often subject to strict contracts\nfrom which it is difficult to escape. Besides, they deal with sensitive corporate\ninformation, so a trust relationship between customer and provider is neces-sary.\nThe OFT concern about the Big Four\nhaving established an oligopoly is therefore fair, and that is why they have recommended a yet-to-be-concluded inves-tigation. It will be the exhaustive analysis\nof their actions, past and present, which\nwill allow the OFT to determine whether\nsuch a thing is actually taking place.\nNeedless to say, if it were to be concluded that the Four had colluded and\nwere operating in a cartel, the main beneficiaries of its dissolution would be the\nrest of the world companies. It does not\ntherefore seem fair to justify such an oligopoly \u2013 if it actually existed \u2013 by claiming that it is their success that lead to\nit; tumours also are successful growers,\nbut that does not mean they should not\nbe extirpated if harmful.\nAs for the EU concerns, they do seem\njustified, especially if past events are\ntaken into account. Indeed, if the same\ncompany who audits your accounts could\nprovide you with consultancy services,\nthen a conflict of interest could appear\nas the latter grew in size. In the times of\nthe Big Five, Andersen Consulting faced\nsuch a conflict of interests with Enron,\nand when the latter went bankrupt, the\nformer sank into scandal as it arose it\nhad helped with the creative accounting\nof the former.\nBoth actions are just preliminary in-vestigations, and no culprits have been\nfound yet. But, as said, if someone was\nto benefit from them being found, it\nwould be the rest of the world, and no\nmatter how successful the Big Four are,\nwe cannot risk them colluding against us\nor facing and failing to solve the same\nconflict of interests that lead to the Enron scandal.\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nTotal Market Capitalisation of Stock Market\nClients (\u00a3m)\nPwC\nDeloitte\nKPMG\nErnst & Young\nBDO\n1,159,200\n522,778\n521,758\n385,223\n21,885\nFigures from The Corporate Advisers Rankings Guide by\nHemscott\nIn Numbers\nThe Big Four\nTotal Profit of Stock Market Clients (\u00a3m)\nPwC\nDeloitte\nKPMG\nErnst & Young\nBDO\n138,334\n70,004\n59,372\n29,200\n556\nLet\u2019s hope not, argues Rajvinder Virdee in this debate\nFirst there were eight, then there were five, and now only four professional service\nfirms perform the majority of audits for both publicly and privately traded companies\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nThat dangerous \u2018O\u2019 word\nMichael Cook questions Baroness Greenfield\u2019s claims that videogames cause\nADHD, schizophrenia and other mental disorders\nFELIX\n28 Friday 11 NOVEMBER 2011\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLaurence Pope\nO\npinion is something of a dirty word\nwhen it comes to science. Opinion\nhappens all the time within the walls\nof Imperial, but it comes in the form\nof chitchat, idle speculation and the\nexchange of ideas. It rarely, if ever, worms its way\ninto academic papers and serious propositions, and\nwhen it does it's usually questioned, dissected and\nmade demands of. We're keen to segregate speculation and fact unless the former shows itself worthy\nof being considered the latter.\nIn some media outlets, however, 'Opinion' is a\nGet Out Of Jail Free card. It's a carte blanche to\nwrite what you wish, and as long as you pepper that\nwriting with lots of 'could be's or 'may's then your\npoorly-supported behind is covered. What this\nmeans is that someone in a position of authority,\nwith scientific letters before and after their name,\ncan write an opinion column and claim more or\nless whatever they wish. Write it in the right way,\nand you might as well be penning the lead feature\nin New Scientist.\nSo it was this week in The Times, where Baroness Greenfield wrote an Opinion piece in which she\nclaimed among other things that gaming's inability\nto provide 'meaning' might be causing the brains\nof young, innocent, adorable children to decay into\nnothingness. The headline reads, \"Are video games\ntaking away our identities?\u201d The headline might as\nwell read, \"Video games are taking away our iden-tities.\"\nGreenfield begins by describing videogames as\n'literal' experiences, by which she appears to mean\nthat videogames can carry no artistic meaning or\nemotional weight, and are essentially no different\nto playing with a cup and ball. She expresses herself most curiously by comparing playing Mario to\nreading a book: \"When you play a computer game\nto rescue the princess, it is not because the princess\nis meaningful to you... Yet when you read a book, it\nis because you care about the characters.\"\nIt's easy to dismiss this as snobbishness \u2013 and\nin an article that quotes Shakespeare and Euripides that is a fairly simple argument to make \u2013 but\nwhat's clear is that Baroness Greenfield either\nhas never played a videogame, or does not enjoy\nthem. Giving her the benefit of the doubt that she\nwouldn't write such an article having never played\nvideogames, the fact that she doesn't enjoy them\neasily explains why she doesn't feel they have\nmeaning or emotional weight \u2013 because for her,\nthey don't. Similarly, I don't enjoy much Shakespeare, and that makes it hard for me to relate to\nany of the characters or themes being conveyed. To\nsay, as a result, that the medium of drama is devoid\nof meaning seems a little heavy-handed.\nIn any case, the real problem in the article is\nthat Greenfield uses the lack-of-meaning argument\nto motivate \u2013 namely, that by consuming content\nthat has no meaning we are thereby losing a part of\nour mental faculties. She heavily implies through\na careful use of language that videogames are responsible for a \u201cdrop in empathy\u201d in the population (whatever that might mean), an \u201cincrease in\naggressiveness\u201d and a rise in the prescription of\nADHD medication, the latter being particularly\nforced as she proposes two likely causes for this\nrise, and then goes on to say that \"a third possibil-ity... if... might...\" until the tail end of the sentence\ncarries a vanishingly small probability.\nBut probability doesn't matter, because Baroness\nProfessor Susan Greenfield CBE PhD BSc holds\n30 honorary degrees, is frequently on TV and ra-dio, and was awarded the Royal Society's Faraday\nPrize. Greenfield doesn't need to establish a basis\nCOD: MW3 theft shocks world\nSo I guess some of you were expecting a Modern Warfare 3 review, right? I barely have enough\nmoney to subsist on dry bread and so little free time\nthat I can only sleep for half an hour each day, so\nyou expect me to purchase and play COD: MW3?\nI guess a man can dream. If you\u2019re all good little\ngirls and boys I\u2019ll have one of my richer contributors review it next week. But for now, enjoy/endure\nthis amusing little piece about everyone\u2019s favourite\nmodern army shooter. It would have gone into the\nnews section, but apparently only big news goes\nthere, picky editors.\nIt seems that the European release date of November 8 was a little too far away for some folk. Emulating a crime that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a\nGTA game, two enterprising masked men wielding\ntear gas grenades hijacked a French truck carrying\n6000 copies of Infinity Ward\u2019s latest product. The\ntwo men, no doubt amazingly dedicated gamers,\npulled out the drivers and escaped with the truck,\nalong with its precious shipment. The cargo\u2019s overall value? Just shy of \u00a3350,000.\nIn other news, similar attacks were reported several hours later on vans carrying large quantities\nof Gatorade and Cheetos. Coincidence? I\u2019ll let you\ndecide.\n\u201cWrite an opinion column\nin the right way, and you\nmight as well be penning\nthe lead article in New\nScientist\u201d\nfor a claim; she merely needs to imply its veracity,\nand herein lies the problem.\nLast month, Greenfield was quoted by The Sun\nas having said that videogames caused a form\nof \u201cdementia\u201d in children. A spokesperson later\nclaimed this had \u201cmisrepresented\u201d her views. She\nspoke out about Internet Addiction Syndrome, after which Ben Goldacre asked her to publish results\nor conduct a study. Greenfield likened Goldacre\nto those who used to claim smoking didn't cause\ncancer. Now, in this Times article, she constructs a\nweak argument against gaming's artistic merit, and\nuses it to imply a causal link between it and neurological disorders.\nLast known image of one of the men\nbelieved to have been involved\nThis is (another) public service\nannouncement to all gamers/writers/\npeople at Imperial.\nWe are looking for budding writers!\nYour idea can be one-sentence or a\nwhole feature.\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all! We\u2019re also\nlooking for artists and designers. If\nyou\u2019re willing to help us direct, produce,\nresearch (i.e. play games), collate and\ndesign the magazine then we want you.\nEmail:\nomar.hafeez-bore06@imperial.ac.uk\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClaims that games like GTA IV negatively impact on one\u2019s mental state need to be supported\nIf videogames were causing my brain to weaken\nand become damaged, I would want to know. I'd\nbe surprised if I found a gamer who wouldn't want\nto know. No one is denying Greenfield's claims\nbecause they want to sweep this under the rug.\nThey're asking questions because her claims are\nunsupported, they are fuelling suspicion and hatred\nof videogames, and above all else they're teaching\nthe public that science is about people with letters\nafter their name telling you what is true and what\nis false.\nThis is not how science works. But it remains to\nbe seen whether anyone will really make a dent in\nGreenfield's arguments, or whether these 'opinion'\npieces will be a regular fixture for the next half-decade.\n\u201cIn her Times article, [Bar-oness Greenfield] constructs a weak argument\nagainst gaming\u2019s artistic\nmerit\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 37\nSPORT\nFriday 11 november 2011\n...Continued from back page\nOn Saturday 5th November, the Imperial 2nd team continued their unbeaten\nstart to the ULU season with an outstanding performance against the medic\n2nd team. The traditional rivalry within\nthis fixture always adds a bit of excitement to the pre-match preparation, and\nit was evident in the warm-up that the\nsquad was very much focused on the\ntask at hand.\nThe foundations for the result were\nlaid early on in the match, as Imperial\ncame flying out of the blocks to score\nan early goal. Beasley played March\nthrough down the right flank, and\nMarch\u2019s looping shot slipped through\nthe keeper\u2019s grasp to give Imperial the\nlead. The second goal followed swiftly\nas a corner was headed on by Beasley\nand finished by Wright at the far post.\nImperial were able to maintain the\nupper-hand in both the possession and\nterritory stakes, and a third goal arrived\nwhen Joffre collected the ball on the\nedge of the area and rifled a shot into\nthe right hand corner of the net.\nWith the score at 3-0 the medics put\ntogether some nice attacking moves\nwhich resulted in some chances, and\nthis served as a reminder to Imperial\nthat the job was not over yet. Before\nhalf-time, Caron met Joffre\u2019s corner\nwith a powerful header at the far post\nto send Imperial 4-0 up at the interval.\nThe second half began competitively,\nuntil Imperial were able to extend their\nadvantage when Joffre burst through on\ngoal and slid his shot low into the corner\nof the net. It was another fine goal from\nJoffre who would go on to earn man of\nthe match. Shortly after, Joffre played a\npass through to March who curled the\nball beautifully into the top right corner\nto make it 6-0.\nHaving made both of their available\nsubstitutions, Imperial suffered a couple\nof injuries in quick succession. With the\nteam down to 10 and even 9 men for\na short time, the emphasis was largely\non keeping possession and maintaining a shape as players filled into unfamiliar positions. Although this blunted\nsome of the attacking threat, the quality of football was still high. This was\nrewarded by a further two goals for\nMarch, both assisted by some sublime\nskill from Baptista.\nThe result was one which will live\nlong in the memory of every Imperial\nplayer, and it was rewarding to see elements worked on in training and previous matches come together in a superb\nperformance. The victory preserves\nImperial\u2019s unbeaten start to the ULU\nseason and sends them one point off of\ntop of the table. After a break this week-end, the team will look to continue their\nstrong start against LSE 2s before a crucial derby match against Imperial 3s!\nTim Beasley\nFootball\nSelected results in association with\nSports Partnership\nWednesday 9th November\nBADMINTON\nMedicals Men\u2019s 1st 0\nPortsmouth 1st 8\nWomen\u2019s 1st 4\nHertfordshire 1st 4\nMen\u2019s 1st 4\nKingston 1st 4\n(lost on points difference)\nBASKETBALL\nMen\u2019s 1st 71\nWestminster 1st 56\nFENCING\nWomen\u2019s 2nd 133\nWarwick 1st 113\nFOOTBALL\nMedicals Football 1st 2\nHertfordshire 3rs 1\nMen\u2019s 2nd 4\nLondon South Bank 3rd 0\nMen\u2019s 3rd 3\nSt Mary\u2019s 6th 1\nGOLF\nMixed 1st 1.5\nKingston 2nd 4.5\nHOCKEY\nMen\u2019s 1st 4\nSt Mary\u2019s 1st 1\nWomen\u2019s 1st 4\nRoyal Holloway 1st 1\nMedical Women\u2019s 1st 17\nRoyal Free 2nd 0\nWomen\u2019s 2nd 0\nRoyal Free 1st 15\nMen\u2019s 3rd 1\nPortsmouth 2nd 5\nMen\u2019s 4th 0\nBrunel 2nd 10\nMedicals Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nKings Medics 1st 3\nMedical Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nRoehampton 1st 3\nMedicals Women\u2019s 3rd 0\nKings Medics 3rd 7\nLACROSSE\nMen\u2019s 1st 8\nHertfordshire 1st 4\nNETBALL\nWomen\u2019s 1st 39\nSt Bart\u2019s 26\nWomen\u2019s 3rd 30\nBuckinghamshire 3rd 12\nMedicals Women\u2019s 3rd 8\nKings Medics 1st 27\nMedicals Women\u2019s 5th 6\nBrunel 6th 49\nRUGBY UNION\nMen\u2019s 1st 59\nSt Bart\u2019s 10\nMedicals Men\u2019s 1st 30\nKent 1st 0\nMedicals Men\u2019s 2nd 25\nChichester 2nd 21\nMedicals Men\u2019s 3rd 27\nReading 4th 39\nSQUASH\nWomen\u2019s 1st 2\nPortsmouth 1st 2\nMen\u2019s 2nd 5\nImperial 3rd 0\nMen\u2019s 4th 0\nKent 1st 3\nTABLE TENNIS\nMen\u2019s 1st 5\nKings 1st 12\nTENNIS\nMen\u2019s 1st 10\nKent 1st 2\nWomen\u2019s 1st 10\nKing\u2019s College 1st 2\nMen\u2019s 2nd 8\nChichester 1st 4\nSunday 6th November\nINTER-HALL FOOTBALL\nGarden & Weeks FC 0\nWilson House FC 2\nBeit Hall FC 4\nLinstead FC 0\nEastside United FC 4\nClayponds FC 3\nSouthside FC 5\nHolbein &Willis Jackson FC 2\nP\u2019bridge and Parsons Falcons 0\nSouthwellFC 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 2s 8\nICSM 2s 0\nIC trounce Medics\nthanks to strong play by the Surrey de-fense, but the Immortals Defense kept\nSurrey out of the game. The stingers\nalmost earned themselves some points\nwhen a running back was free to make\n40 yards; but an incredible show of\npace and tackling skill by Dexter Valencia stopped the run. Meaning, at the\nend of the half the score was a punishing 19-0.\nThe second half started well; the Immortals Kick-off team having a spectacular game managed to consistently\nmake big hits and meant that Surrey\nwere always starting with poor field\nposition. Combined with a defense\nwhich was making mincemeat of the\nSurrey offense, Imperial soon had the\nball back in their possession.\nWith the lead established it was up to\nthe Rookie players to show what they\ncould do; and they proved themselves\ntrue Immortals. Fantastic first game\nperformances in offense by Lawrence\nWild, superb tackling by Matt Connell\nand a fantastic 10 yards diving catch\nby Wide Receiver Max all lead to the\nfirst rookie touchdown of the season\nwith a weaving run by Deebo Ogunbanjo.\nThe defense showed some powerful players throughout; Temi Ladega\nand Maciej Kurek showing speed\nand power to sack the Surrey Quarterback multiple times, while great\ncoverage of both run and pass plays\nby the Linebackers meant the Surrey\noffense struggled to make first down.\nThird down finished with 20 points\nhaving been scored; special mentions\nto QB Rob who showed some excellent pace and strength to run the ball\nrepeatedly for first downs. Unfortunately despite having an impressive\nrunning and passing game until then,\nImmortals\nbeat Surrey\nVeteran QB Rob Wolstenhome threw\nan ill-conceived pass in the 4th Quarter which was fantastically intercepted\nby a Surrey player and returned for a\ntouchdown.

In fact, the book\n(probably) discusses his struggle with being a Conservative and a\nhomosexual. Similar themes are possibly discussed in Liam Fox and\nWilliam Hague\u2019s upcoming memoirs.

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\n32\nScouts\nFELIX\nFriday 11 november 2011\nC\nhaplaincy is really about conversation,\u201d is the way a student once\nput it. Chaplaincy is a faith based\nwelfare service for students. We\nseek to provide hospitality, sup-port, reflection and dialogue around belief, re-ligion, faith and spirituality. What that actually\nmeans is different types of \u2018conversations\u2019.\nSome conversations are quite straightforward.\nThese are responses to clear religious needs \u2013\n\u2018I have just moved flat where is my nearest\nmosque/temple/church?\u2019 or \u2018I would like to find\nout more about my religion \u2013 can I meet with\nthe Faith Advisor?\u2019 or \u2018Are there prayer rooms\nI can use?\u2019\nTo reflect the diversity of religious views held\nby members of Imperial, the Chaplaincy has a\nteam of Chaplains and Faith Advisors for a variety of world faiths: Jewish, Christian, Muslim,\nHindu and Buddhist. The Chaplaincy Centre has\nspace for meetings and worship. We have quiet\nplaces in Beit Quad and Princes Gardens for\nmeditation or prayer.\nFor those who want to explore a particular\nfaith practice, Chaplaincy provides opportunities for meditation from Christian, Buddhist, and\nHindu traditions.\nChaplaincy can also help with \u2018conversations about meaning\u2019. In an international academic community like Imperial there is a massive range of beliefs about the \u2018big questions of\nlife\u2019. These include, among others, \u2018Why we are\nhere?\u2019 \u2018What constitutes a person?\u2019 \u2018Where do\nwe find meaning?\u2019 \u2018Do meanings have a lasting\nvalue?\u2019 \u2018Why do bad things happen?\u2019 and \u2018Is\nthere a God/god? And if there is what does that\nmean?\u2019\nThese questions are not just intellectual ques-tions. Some of these questions relate to how\nwe see and treat others. These influence our\nrelationships, our professional ethics and our\npolitics. The questions of purpose may influence\nhow we see our work and career choices. And\nthese apparently intellectual questions can have\nemotional dimensions about trust, hope, fear and\ndesire.\nThe Chaplains have time for very open reflective conversations that allow us to do our thinking out loud. These conversations are confidential and respectful of the person\u2019s worldview.\nSometimes highly creative conversations occur\nbecause of great differences in religious and\nphilosophical outlook. Rooted in our own tradi-tions, we offer space for open reflective conversation to anyone who wants to use it.\nIncreasingly, Chaplaincy is involved in conversations between people from different reliWhat\u2019s it all about?\ngious traditions. This is about learning firsthand\nabout other people\u2019s beliefs and practice. It is\nalso about becoming skilled at handling divergent and conflicting views. This kind of conversation is now trying to create new and positive\nengagement between religious and humanist\nperspectives. (See Rory Fenton\u2019s Guardian Online Comment at bit.ly/nJEJxI).\nThe other emerging conversation of our time\nis with those who describe themselves as \u2018spiritual but not religious\u2019. With students at the Royal College of Art we now have a non-religious\nmeditation time. This uses simple methods of\nself awareness that allows people from different\nbackgrounds to share silence and stillness (and is\nopen to Imperial students).\nGoodconversationisonethatcanbringchange\nand growth to both conversation partners. Conversations with students and colleagues from\ndifferent religious and secular perspectives have\nshown me that my own faith is not about intellectual certainty but about deeper relationships\nof trust.\nIn the Chaplaincy we are open for conver-sation. So if you want to talk about Nietzsche\nand the death of God, or you want to try Indian\ncooking with our Hindu Chaplain, or walk a lab-yrinth, or try interfaith discussion, or talk about\nmedical or engineering ethics, or sing carols, or\ntalk about your anatomy classes, or if you have a\nreally weird dream and want to change career, or\nto find new ways to pray, or talk about someone\nwho has died, or if you want to find out about the\nreligion of the person you have just fallen in love\nwith, or... as I say, we are open to conversation.\nFor more information about Chaplaincy conversations and experiments in religion, spirituality and faith see www.imperial.ac.uk/chap-laincy\nCollege Chaplain Andrew Willson introduces the Chaplaincy \u2013 a welfare service for Imperial students\nWhen someone says \u2018girl guide\u2019 or \u2018scout\u2019 to you,\nmany people fondly envisage either the days of being one themselves, or the likes of a Brownie or\nCub Scout doing something craft based or learning\nknots. What many people don\u2019t realise is that both\norganisations in fact have sections aimed at people\nup to the age of 25, who do activities that are relevant to them: a casual camping trip all of a sudden\nhas the chance to get a lot more extreme.\nThis term, there has been a rejuvenation of the\nScout & Guide group at Imperial, called \u2018SSAGO\u2019,\npart of the Student Scout and Guide Organisation.\nLast active just over 10 years ago it has re-estab-lished, and as a project, it has many facets. The\nfirst is as a mixed Student group, open to everyone,\nwhich does a variety of activities (characteristic of\nboth Scouting & Guiding) from archery to attending\nthe Comedy Store.\nThen there are the badges. It\u2019s easy at Imperial\nto get swept up in the everyday hustle and bustle of\nlabs, tutorials, lectures, coursework, and come out\nof it wondering what physical, satisfying, tangible\nevidence you have of your accomplishments. That\u2019s\nwhat the humble badge is for, a symbol of something to work towards and a true beacon of achievement once obtained. You may scoff now, but you\u2019ll\nmull it over later, and want one.\nThe other less obvious facet to this group is the\nvolunteering. In the same heady mix identified\nabove, it is equally easy to go through your entire\nImperial career without ever interacting with the\nlocal, non-Imperial, community. Through SSAGO,\nyou\u2019re able to get in touch with a local Guide or\nScout group to volunteer your skills and experience\nto an audience from anywhere between 5 and 18,\non a one-off occasion or something more regular.\nThis offers really rewarding opportunity to work with\nchildren, and allows you to share your experience\nwith a fascinated audience.\nIf you want to tie everything SSAGO has to offer\ntogether, perhaps the most exciting and challenging\nfacet of the project is the opportunity to undertake\nthe Duke of Edinburgh Award (or finish an uncompet-ed one), or the Queen\u2019s Guide/ Scout Award. We\u2019ve\ngot a presentation about these and more on November 22, and if you\u2019d like to hear more we\u2019d love to\nhear from you by emailing ssago@imperial.ac.uk.\nJenny Wilson\n\u201c\n\u201cIn a community like\nImperial there is a\nmassive range of beliefs\nabout the \u2018big questions\nof life\u201d Chaplaincy can help with \u2018conversations about meaning\u2019\nChaplaincy provides opportunities for various world faiths\nBetter than Titanic\nJonathan Peek\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX\n24\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nJames Simpson\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 11 November 2011\nThis week on Twitter\nSome top tweets from Felix TV\u2019s\nfollowers and followees\n@sickipediabot\nSuicide bombers - if you really\nwant to see 72 virgins, then\nsimply pop down to GAME at\nmidnight.\nThe advent of digital satellite broadcasting\nbrought with it a torrent of mind-numbing\nprograms (including certain controversial chat\nshows\u2026) aimed at an audience with the collective sentient ability of a squashed banana\n(sorry, I simply couldn\u2019t resist!). So from this\nseemingly endless stream of drivel, it is rare\nto find such a veritable gem of broadcasting\nmerit as David Attenborough\u2019s latest offering:\nFrozen Planet.\nWhat we have here is an impeccable exposition of the best of the BBC juxtaposed with\nthe best of nature: the culmination of over six\nyears worth of filming time in some of the\ntoughest environments on this planet. From\namazing under-ice footage (the result of over\n134 hours of filming under Arctic sea ice) to\nclose-ups of entire pods of orcas, this show\nmakes for unforgettable viewing.\nThe seven part series, the very love child\nof the BBC and Mother Nature, concentrates\non the changing seasons at the poles, with\nthe first three episodes (covering Spring and\nSummer) having aired already (and currently\navailable on iPlayer). Whilst concentrating on\nthe cycle of life, the show does also examine\nman\u2019s activities in these regions. But even if\nyou are as much the climate skeptic as I am,\ndon\u2019t be put off: the breathtaking scenes and\nstories throughout do more than make up for\nthis.\nFrom the kleptomaniac habits of penguins,\nto the clinical team hunting skills of orcas,\nFrozen Planet has much in store for the view-er. Some flawless time-lapse photography\ncoupled with stunning close-ups shots effectively portray life in this, the most seasonal\nof places. In addition, some spectacular aerial\nshots give magnificent views of the barren expanse of the tundra, whilst the HD is certainly\nnoticeable .\nThe BBC producers have, once again, excelled themselves. Epic slow motion shots of\ntwo 4-ton elephant seals fighting to control a\nharem of over 50 females are a sight to be-hold, especially as these mountains of blubber waddle to the battlefield. As these \u2018beachmasters\u2019 do battle the music of George Fenton\naptly provides a certain sense of grandeur to\nthe whole affair. With excerpts that at times\nhark back to the scores of John Williams, it is\nclear from where Fenton gets his inspiration,\nbut the music is sublime in complementing the\nfilming.\nNone of this would be as impressive without\nthe wise, yet dulcet, tones of Sir David Attenborough. Now in his 85th year, and with\nover 57 years of experience in the field, there\ncan be no doubt that Frozen Planet hangs on\nhis every word. With his unique descriptions\nof everything from courtship and through to\nsurvival techniques, he provides that essential\nrefinement that makes this show special.\nA nice addition to each episode is a 20-min-ute addendum known as \u2018Freeze Frame\u2019 (pun\nprobably intended). Interviews and commentaries with the indefatigable crew chronicle the\nrisks, including 130mph windstorms, faced in\nfilming the program. It becomes apparent that\nit was a serious undertaking to produce a show\nof this calibre, and this only goes to emphasise\nwhy you should watch it: if only to make your\nTV licence payment worthwhile.\nI cannot extoll the virtues of this program\nenough. This documentary is nothing short of\na masterpiece. Not only is it both beautiful\nand informative, but is also, dare I say, cool.\nDon\u2019t let yourself miss it.\nFrozen Planet - a true masterpiece\n@HBO\n39 years ago today, Home\nBox Office was born. #happy-birthdayHBO\n@charltonbrooker\nThe NOTW use of a P.I. seems\njustifiable when you consider\nhis investigations PROVED\nHarry Potter\u2019s parents are still\nalive.\n@RadioTimes\nOur most popular tweet today,\nby miles: Downton Abbey\nofficially recommissioned for\nthird series. #DowntonAbbey\n@RadioTimes\nGerman TV lifts ban on \u201cNazi\u201d\nStar Trek episode #startrek\nThe culmination of years of filming in barren conditions, married with the inimitable voice of Sir David Attenborough\nGeorge Howard\nA Great British institution\n@bbcsoundeffects\nDonk.\n\u201cWhat we have here is an\nimpeccable exposition\nof the best of the BBC\njuxtaposed with the best\nof nature\u201d\n\n"

The\nplacards will be waved and students will rapidly get bored of\nchanting, \u201cNo ifs. No buts. No\neducation cuts.\u201d Two student\ndemonstrations are planned for November, with the first happening on the\nWednesday just gone. However, this\nyear, the figh t is against the rapid increase in privatisation of universities\ndiscussed in the Government\u2019s higher\neducation white paper. After a full\nblown attack on the proposal of rising\nfees last winter (that had little effect\non a government unwilling to listen)\nquestions are being posed, such as:\nWhy do we protest? What does it aim\nto achieve?\nProtest is not indulged in for personal gratification, as only the masochistic would take enjoyment from\ntraipsing around in freezing weather,\nthe possibility of \u2018kettling\u2019, and the\nchance to become a stress toy for police aggression. Protest is instead a\nresult of democratic breakdown. Ideally, we would never have to; policy\nwould be dictated by what the people\nwant, and large masses of the population would never feel the need to\ntake to the streets. However, when\nthe majority of people are prevented\na voice; protest, a method of last re-sort, becomes more common. Neat\nexamples of this are strikes. There is\nrising industrial action in this country as the Government refuses to\nnegotiate on public sector cuts and\nis happy to support companies who\nwish to ignore their workers, forcing employees to strike. In Germany,\nhowever, the economic slump has not\nbeen accompanied by union agitation as negotiations were made early\non in discussions with the workers.\nThis vague attempt at democracy is\nincreasingly lacking in this country.\nStrikes are another poignant example of how people regularly argue\nagainst protest; they lament that it\ndoes nothing for their cause, and try\nto get others to share this viewpoint.\nHowever, any form of true protest\nwill always generate enemies. If you\ntry and raise your voice enough to be\nheard then it will be decided that your\nvoice is too loud and you should shut\nup. As the anarchist saying goes, \u201cIf\nprotest achieved anything, it would\nbe made illegal.\u201d The legal boundaries of protest are decided on what\nwill allow people to feel a stance is\nbeing made without ever letting anything be achieved.\nGovernment will never allow anything to happen that truly challenges\nits power. This is why the idea of\nstate condoned protest is a paradox.\nIf it is allowed by the state, it is because they have nothing to worry\nabout. This is why protest has to\nmake a stance in both its words and\nits actions. The Occupy London\nprotest, which, although without de-mands, can be seen as being against\nraging inequality and corporate greed\nat the expense of the vast majority, is\ncamping in the City of London. This\nis not only the location of what they\nare against, but is also an area of almost solely private property with the\npublic space controlled by a bizarrely\npartially privatised local authority.\nSt. Paul\u2019s occupiers are not just requesting change; they are physically\nreturning space to public use. It is\nthis action that may cause its eviction\nby authorities. Protest is strongest\nwhen it enacts pre-figurative politics,\nthat is, the action is the change you\nwant to see. Hence, these coming student demonstrations and inevitable\noccupations of campuses will involve\n\u2018free universities\u2019 that attempt to create a new way of learning.\nAlthough, as a possible \u2018winter of\ndiscontent\u2019 approaches we should\nremember that \u2013 when marches turn\nugly as they go off a pre-described\nroute, as students and lecturers strike\nDoth the lady protest too\nmuch?\nLuke Sheldon\nThis banner only rhymes with certain accents. Also, your university name is a pronoun,\nwhere are the captial letters? Lazy sign work. Gets a 2:2, at most\nThis week saw the release of a summary of\nthe annual Rector\u2019s Away Day, with Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions announcing a statement pledging\nto improve the \u2018undergraduate experience\u2019,\nwith the improvement of assessment and\nfeedback becoming a priority in this aim. The\nbattle against feedback has been continuing\nfor some time now, however, and it may ultimately fall to tackling the individual marker\nrather than the department when it comes to\nimproving feedback across College.\nThe College seeks to improve the \u2018undergraduate experience\u2019 through the enforcement of such commitments as assessing the\nprovision of undergraduate accommodation\nand improving the feedback that students receive for their assignments.\nThis specific mention towards feedback\n(especially considering the clear reference\ntowards the results of the 2011 National\nStudent Survey) may appear familiar to\nsome of you. This would not be particularly\nsurprising, particularly since October 2010\nsaw that year\u2019s National Student Survey reveal issues \u2013 again \u2013 with Imperial\u2019s student\nfeedback. At the time, the Rector became\npersonally involved in an attempt to improve\nassessment and feedback across all College\ndepartments.\nNow, it appears that history is repeating\nitself. It is commendable that the College\ncontinues to recognise that feedback is a\nproblem for students. However, the Away\nDay has resulted in recommendations such\nas \u2018Points for departments to consider\u2019, with\none such point declaring that departments\nshould aim to \u2018be clear with students as\nearly in the course as possible about: what\nconstitutes feedback, submission deadlines\nfor assignments and when feedback will be\nreturned.\nSurely, points such as this must have been\nat least considered last year in the attempt\nto improve feedback at that time and hammered home inside departments.\nUltimately, the problem rests with the in-dividual, and not the department. Faculties\nresponded last year with the attempted implementation of a two-week turnover for feed-back. While this may be achieved in a variety\nof cases, the quality of this feedback is truly\nwhat matters. It is simply unreasonable to expect all markers to provide uniform effort towards the marking of coursework or reports.\nUntil the College and departments are\nable to improve the willingness, or at least\nawareness, of the marker to provide decent\nfeedback to students (and an increased use\nof the word \u2018feedback\u2019 itself is a potentially\neffective way of ensuring this), then for all\nits promises and pledges, feedback and assessment will remain contentious among\nstudents.\non November 30 and lecture theatres\nare occupied \u2013 protest is a last resort\ndue to a failing of democracy. Without\nacts that are possibly of some inconvenience and disturb the current law\nand order, nothing will be achieved.\nThe suffragettes, a movement that\nfew could disagree with, was not just\npeople chanting in locations that were\nagreed by the police, it had many discomforting aspects. Windows were\nsmashed, fires were started, bombs\nwere thrown, and women died. Without these more militant actions, that\nraised the profile of the debate, women may still not have the vote. I personally don\u2019t condone violent direct\naction, but we cannot start groaning\nevery time pointless rules are broken\n(such as march route changes and not\nbeing allowed to camp on a pave-ment), otherwise the voices of the\npowerless will be drowned out even\nmore, to our own detriment.

In addition, the increase in\nthe number of people buying organic goods is\nshowing no signs of slowing down. The supporters of this \u2018green lifestyle\u2019 believe that it is\nnot just a fashion trend that is going to disappear in the future, as they argue that organic\nproducts are of greater quality despite their\nslightly higher cost.\nThe producers explain that the reason for the\npopularity of organic food is because they are\nfree from hormones, pesticides, preservatives,\nand chemicals \u2013 offering healthier nutrition to\nthe consumers.\nAnd this is scientifically confirmed.\nResearch that took place in the USA in 1984\nproved that organic products contain many\nmore nutrients like phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Specifically, organic\nlettuce contains almost twice as much phosphorus and four times the quantity of calcium that\nis contained in the conventional lettuce.\nMoreover, a group of European scientists\nhave proved that organic fruit and vegetables\ncontain 40% more antioxidants than normal.\nAntioxidants are beneficial for the heart and\nhelp the prevention of cancer.\nIn addition to the health benefits, the organic\nproduction systems have a large ecosystem im-pact, as they are designed to respect the balance\nobserved in our natural ecosystems. Organic\nfarms actively encourage biodiversity in order\nto maintain soil fertility and aid natural pest\ncontrol \u2013 in contrast with conventional farms.\nTherefore, after a great deal of research in\norganic markets and farms, I have prepared a\nshopping list for you listing my top five organic\nproducts available on the market, so that you\nknow where to go and what to choose!\nMandarin & Ginger Extra Dark Chocolate by Seed & Bean\nDescription: Dominican Cocoa is delightfully blended with Italian Mandarin essential oil and a hint of ginger from China for a blissfully warm enveloping orange\nconfection.\nMore details: www.seedandbean.co.uk\nMini Magoo\u2019s Granuesli with Bluberries\nDescription: Rich, handmade cereals. I particularly like the distinctive flavour of each ingredient that is not tainted by any addi-tives. You can find it many different flavours such as dates or ginger.\nMore Details: www.minimagoo.com\nMini Vegbox by Riverford Organic Farm\nDescription: It contains 7 or 8 varieties of very high quality fresh\nvegetables \u2013 better then Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s.

Open from early morning\nuntil late at night, Soho Joe is an exciting new venture situated in the heart of Soho, serving a range\nof food and drinks at extremely affordable prices.\nWandering around the West End, I stumbled upon\nSoho Joe. For an Italian-style trattoria, it was the\nperfect balance between tradition and contemporary design. As you walk in, there is a mouthwatering food counter on the side and a number of\nstylish wooden tables with (surprisingly) comfortable stools.\nYou order and pay at the counter and soon\nenough a lovely plate of food is put in front of you.\nI had chosen an Aberdeen Angus beef burger with\nchips and I had not an ounce of regret, it was simply divine. Held by two slices of ciabatta bread and\nsome salad, the steak was seasoned with a mix\nof pepper and spices and cooked beautifully. The\nchips were perfect: crispy on the outside, fluffy\nand soft inside. To drink, the French Merlot was\nvery nice.\nThe atmosphere of the place really added to its\ncharm. Throughout the evening, the restaurant\nwas quite busy, people were happy and loud but\nyou could always have a conversation without\nmuch difficulty. The customers were lively and\neven provided a certain entertainment factor, one\nof them was recognised by a waitress from being\non the cover of a men\u2019s fitness magazine. With\nCharles Trenet\u2019s \u2018La Mer\u2019, \u2018Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off\nYou\u2019, some Stephane Pompougnac and the odd\npiece of gangster music in the background, it was\nan interesting and pleasant mix.\nBudget-wise, the restaurant was more than rea-sonable, even quite cheap for the quality of the\nfood. The burger was \u00a37, as are all the pizzas on\nthe menu (they looked and smelt fantastic). The\nwine was \u00a34 a glass, but there were cheaper\ndrinks available. Overall, you could easily eat for a\ntenner; push it to \u00a315\u2013\u00a320 and you could also enjoy a great starter of antipasti or houmous. There\nare also pasta dishes and hot sandwiches.

In a message to staff,\nMacKinnon stated, \u201cI have had enough conversations with students over the last couple\nof years \u2026 to convince me that there is a real\nproblem, which needs to be addressed.\u201d\nImperial College Union\u2019s recent response to\nthe NSS highlighted that a long-term view towards feedback would be the production of a\ncomputer-based system to resolve a perceived\n\u201clack of clarity\u201d in mark allocation, unfair\nmarking and timeliness. The Union also suggested that \u2018cohort analysis\u2019 should be a possibility in order to spot trends with work.\nUnion President Scott Heath has suggested\nthat PhD markers should receive \u201cmore assistance with marking\u201d in the short term.\n\u201cI have already seen shocking examples of\npractice whereby a marker is given a list of\nsix criteria which account for the entire mark\nallocation but no further guidance beyond that.\nIf someone has a possible 10 marks to allocate\nfor \u2018written style\u2019 and they are unsure how\nthey should be given we have to question how\nthe system will ever be fair unless that person\nmarks everything for that year group.\u201d\nWhether staff will act upon the recommendations on an individual level is a question that\nwill be answered over the coming months.\nNEWS\n4 FELIX\nFriday 11 november 2011\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn Brief\nCollege to tackle feedback\nThe issue of assessment and feedback at Imperial has been addressed at this year\u2019s Rector\u2019s\nAway Day.\nThe Rector\u2019s Away Day, which this year\ntook place on October 21, is an annual meeting of senior Imperial staff. The focus of this\nyear\u2019s event was the \u2018student experience\u2019 and\nhow it can be improved. The outcomes from\nthe meeting, notably plans for more detailed\nand timely feedback, were announced on November 8 with a report and video from Rector\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions.\nThe Rector\u2019sAway Day resulted in some key\nrecommendations with respect to feedback.\nA statement from the Rector reveals that all\nHeads of Departments are to develop \u201caction\nplans outlining measures already in place and\nmeasures that they will be introducing during\nthe current academic year to improve the undergraduate student experience\u201d by December.\nFollowing on from a push for \u201cstrong and\nconcerted action\u201d on feedback by the Rector\nlast year, departments are to consider various\nimprovements to feedback, including providing students with early indications of \u201cwhat\nconstitutes feedback\u201d, submission deadlines\nand when feedback will be returned. DepartAlex Nowbar\nAway Day yields recommendations for departments\nments are also to consider offering students\n\u201cdetails of common mistakes made on a particular assignment, so they can avoid them in\nthe future\u201d. Also in the pipeline is potential\nimplementation of a \u201csystem that could be\nused across departments to track the feedback\ngiven to students and monitor timeliness\u201d by\nthe College.\nThe outcome of the Away Day regarding accommodation was that the College intends to\ndeliver the standards that students expect in\nterms of refurbishment of current accommo-dation. In addition, the College intends to look\ninto the construction of new accommodation\nthat fits students\u2019 requirements of price, quality and location.\nThe quality and timeliness of feedback has\nbeen in the spotlight recently, further to Imperial\u2019s disappointing performance in the National Student Survey (NSS). Imperial scored\nparticularly poorly in the ranking for \u201cassessment and feedback\u201d (coming 163rd out of 168\nnationally), not to mention shortfalls in areas\nsuch as teaching and \u201cacademic support\u201d.\nSome departments have already reacted to\nthe College\u2019s pledge to improve feedback.\nProfessor Angus MacKinnon of the Department of Physics has sent a statement to staff,\ndetailing its intention for markers to increase\nDeath leads to safety review\nCollege departments are to conduct a review of all\nareas where liquid nitrogen is stored and used after\na laboratory worker died following a suspected release of liquid nitrogen at Chelsea and Westminster\nHospital.\nA College Health And Safety Essentials (CHASE)\nnotice regarding the storage and use of liquid nitrogen was distributed following the incident. It prompted Heads of Department to undertake a full review\nof all areas under their control where the substance\nis stored and used, highlighting ventilation arrangements and access control for the ventilation plant,\nas well as indicating the importance that all those\ncarrying out work involving the substance are competent to do so and fully aware of emergency proce-dures. The report came into action on November 3.\nThe evaporation of liquid nitrogen reduces the oxygen concentration in the air and can cause asphyxia-tion, particularly in confined spaces. Nitrogen, being\nodourless, colourless and tasteless, is capable of\nasphyxiating without any prior warning or sensation.\nThe laboratory worker who died has been confirmed\nas a member of Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust\nstaff. The Metropolitan Police and the Health and\nSafety Executive have launched a joint investigation\ninto the incident. A departmental assessment into\nthe relevance, storage and use of liquid nitrogen in\nline with College procedures is ongoing.\nAlexander Karapetian\n\n"

    "content": "By\nCharles Motraghi\nBUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 11 november 2011 13\nAlongside finance and high-tech com-puting, biotechnology can be thought of\nas one of the few sectors where Britain\nis still globally competitive. The British\npharmaceutical industry, for example,\nreceives 10% of global research and\ndevelopment funding, despite having\nonly 3% of global sales. But this year\nhas seen a variety of worrying develop-ments: Pfizer, previously the country\u2019s\nfourth largest investor in pharmaceutical research, announced the closure of\nits R&D site in Kent, resulting in the\nloss of 2,400 jobs; AstraZeneca continues to shed jobs, citing patent losses, as\nwell as GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis;\nand start-ups complain of continual difficulties in securing venture capital. So\nis the UK unique in its suffering, and\nwhat successes, if any, has the year\nseen?\nCertainly, the UK is not the only\ncountry to see job losses in this sector.\nIn the US, the global leader of the pharmaceutical industry, Johnson & Johnson\nis still going through the round of huge\njob cuts announced in 2009, and the\nSwiss giants Roche and Novartis find\nthemselves in a similar situation. In fact,\nthe latter is planning to cut 2,000 jobs\nwhilst setting up operations in Taizhou\n(intriguingly dubbed \u201cChina\u2019s Medical\nCity\u201d), due to there being an emerging market and reduced labour costs. It\nThe Business of British Biotechnology\ncould be argued that any present malaise among the British is one afflicting\nthe wider western biotechnology sector,\nand it is not out of step with the global\neconomy.\nBut to some extent, biotechnology\nhere faces its own problems. For in-stance, companies and start-ups in the\nUK have been complaining about the\ndifficulty of securing risk capital for\nyears. Nearly two-fifths of biotechnology companies here have been unable\nto obtain any finance over the past year,\nwith many biotechnology specialists\nreluctant to invest. This highlights a\nlongstanding gap in funding for those\nwho are about to enter promising drugs\ninto the costly early-stage testing in hu-mans, where approximately \u00a310 million\nis needed to support the company prior\nto generating results which will be of\ninterest to larger investors or pharmaceutical companies.\n\u201cA malaise afflicts\nthe wider biotech\nsector, and it is not\nout of step with the\nglobal economy ...\u201d\nThis has been assuaged somewhat recently by two developments: tax credits\nhave been increased for research and\ndevelopment enterprises; and Richard Sykes, a former rector of Imperial College, is chairing a new venture\nfund aiming at new British biotechnology companies freshly spun out of\nacademia. The Deepbridge Innovation\nFund is planning to raise $250m by next\nyear to invest in companies predominantly based in the UK, and will specifically target those with a promising drug,\nbut without proof of relevance.\n\u201c... but biotechnology\nhere faces its own\nproblems\u201d\nBrits might complain alongside\nmost Europeans that the legislative\nand regulatory environment isn\u2019t\nconducive to research. Recently, the\nEuropean Court of Justice ruled that\nno methods to derive embryonic stem\ncells could be patented, setting us\napart from the US and Asia. Although\nthis does not totally condemn companies here (they can still patent their\ninventions abroad), there is fear that\nthis will stifle commercial investment,\nand research in the area is more likely\nto be exploited abroad. This reflects\nthe feelings of many plant scientists\nand genetic engineers, who have had\ntrouble commercialising their public-ly-funded basic research due to European regulations.\nThe year hasn\u2019t been all bad, how-ever. Some companies have seen great\nsuccess in securing funding. Oxford\nNanopore, for example, raised \u00a325\nmillion to develop its next-generation\nDNA sequencing technology, making it a contender to win the Genomics X Prize, awarded to the first team\nto sequence the human genome for\nunder $10,000. Such an achievement\nwould be able to revolutionise personal\nhealthcare. Assisted by Imperial Innovations, Circassia completed a \u00a360\nmillion round of funding in April, to\ndevelop allergy treatments and autoimmune therapies for the treatment of\nconditions such as arthritis and pso-riasis.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX\n16 Friday 11 NOVEMber 2011\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\n\u2019d like to begin by expressing\nmy gratitude for the time and effort put in by a good few people\na couple of weeks ago in response\nto my first foray into the world of\nFelix. I was very happy to see that many\nhad read the article and gone to huge\nlengths to attempt some form of critique.\nAs always, I aim to please, so here we\ngo again.\nI must admit that I wasn\u2019t expecting\nto have to bother writing about the socalled \u2018Occupy\u2019 movement. These demonstrations come and go, and in my mind\nthis was yet another misguided attempt\nby another bunch of loony lefties to\nwreak havoc in the lives of honest, hard-working, and upstanding members of so-ciety. But with the protest now in its 27th\nday, and with no sign that anybody is taking decisive and effective action to have\nthem evicted (and locked up), I am afraid\nthat I must seek to bemoan the appalling\nsituation we now find ourselves in.\nIt seems there is somewhat of a trend\nwhen it comes to socialist protests: a pervasive hypocrisy amongst its supporters.\nTake this one: the police recently did a\nthermal study of the camp at St Paul\u2019s\nat night, only to find that the majority\nof protesters weren\u2019t, in fact, braving\nthe elements in the name of their cause,\nbut had instead opted for the comfort of\ntheir own beds at home. Whilst by the\nday they preach a vacuous anti-capitalist\ncreed, by night they would rather desert\ntheir cause and take advantage of their\nown, no doubt privately owned, homes,\na product of the capitalist system they\nappear to deride. I would also venture\nto suggest that they used the railway\nsystem to get home, another social service produced by rampant capitalism.\nEssentially, what they are doing is not\nprotesting, but simply littering central\nGeorge Howard\nWhat\u2019s the point again?\nProtest is sacred, hypocrisy is really not\nLondon. Their expensive tents should be\nre-appropriated and given to homeless\npeople. At least the homeless would get\nsome use out of them.\nSo we continue to be subjected to pictures in newspapers, day in, day out, of\nprotesters prancing around in their V for\nVendetta masks, getting hideously drunk\n(I don\u2019t have any problem with this real-ly!), vomiting in the street, and generally\nbeing uncouth. The scene is akin to one\nof those ghastly hovels that the travelling (aka under) class seem to call home,\nand smells worse than Louis XIV\u2019s last\nbowel movement. In short, the occupation does little more than express some\nunfounded rage against the rich. To be\nhonest, the whole thing is farcical. But\nthen again, so is socialism.\nI would probably be unwise to suggest here that there shouldn\u2019t be a right\nto protest (no doubt some immature 1st\nyear computing student would have a\nproblem with that\u2026). And to be honest,\nwhilst I often disagree with the reason\nbehind most protests (partly due to the\ndullards who frequent them), the right\nto free speech should be as enshrined in\nour culture and constitution as the place\nof public schools in the education sector.\nI do, however, disagree fundamentally\nwith simply occupying a public area for\nsuch an extended period of time. It\u2019s an\neyesore, and after a few days, just gets\nboring. One of the reasons London is\nsuch an interesting place is the hustle and\nbustle: a continually changing landscape;\nnot the deplorable view of a bunch of ignorant left wing campers. By all means\nhave a march, or go stand outside Parliament for an afternoon, but don\u2019t spoil\neverybody\u2019s view of a magnificent piece\nof architecture for the sake, it seems, of\nsome debunked 19th century ideology.\nIndeed, the whole debacle is making\nO\nn the other word tab\nthere\u2019s a lab summary\nwaiting for me, so my\neagerly procrastinating\nbrain suggested that I\nwrite a bit about a question I\u2019ve been\npondering for some time. I\u2019m sure some\nof you have been wondering over and\nover again as well\u2026 What\u2019s the point of\nTwitter again?\nI\u2019ve thought about this ever since I\nheard about it first\u2026 it\u2019s just like texting\nto the world, telling the world what music you\u2019re listening to, or reading about\nthat burger some celebrity just ate \u2013 so\nhow exactly is that interesting? If any-thing, Facebook served that purpose\nquite sufficiently (and indeed, many\ncelebrities have hooked up their Twitter\nto their Facebook page). Surely, Twitter\nseems a bit more personal, but still, it\ndoesn\u2019t seem necessary at all. That was\nall a while ago, and I\u2019ve kind of set the\nthoughts aside for a bit, but earlier this\nweek, something happened that brought\nit all back to me\u2026 I signed up for Twitter as well.\nI had been thinking about joining a few\nmonths back already, but not seeing the\npoint, I refrained. I now suddenly found\nmyself presented with my own personal\nTwitter page, without being able to name\nany reasons or motivations to join. On\nFacebook, I\u2019m kind of a spectator, hardly posting anything myself. I mostly just\nreading what other people are up to and\nwriting the occasional message or wall\npost. However, I found myself, well, not\ntweeting away, but certainly quickly getting addicted to reading tweets of my favourite artists and posting more on Twitter over the last few days than I posted\non Facebook over the last few weeks. I\nfeel the \u2018magic\u2019of Twitter, but it remains\na mystery to me. What is so fascinating\nabout little fragments of life other people\nsend off into the world, or telling your\nown (in my case, virtually non-existent)\naudience what you\u2019re up to? I\u2019m even\na part of the minority that doesn\u2019t own\na smartphone, so my trusty laptop remains as the only option to checking\nthe timeline. The mysterious attraction\nof Twitter will probably be on my mind\na mockery of not only our legal system\nin being unable to promptly clear the site\n(apparently it could take up to nine years\nto clear the steps of St Paul\u2019s) but also of\nour law enforcement efforts. But, returning to the hypocrisy mentioned earlier:\ndoesn\u2019t the clear dishonesty of the whole\nmovement come to the fore when campers threaten to \u2018prepare violence\u2019 whilst\ncontinue to use the law to prevent (or at\nleast delay) their inevitable eviction. Is it\nnot more than hypocritical to use the law\nwhen it suits them, but defy it when it\ndoesn\u2019t?\nThe protests are an embarrassment.\nIt is costing local traders thousands of\npounds each day in revenue, tarnishing\nthe name of the Church of England, and\nshowing the world, once again, that London, and indeed the United Kingdom,\ncan so easily be held to ransom by an ignorant minority: whether this be by trav-ellers, protesters, unions, or the basest of\npeople: squatters (more on this another\ntime\u2026).\nThis blatant flouting of the law (they\nare in fact camped on a public highway)\nshould be put to an end immediately.\nThe protesters are no more above the\nlaw than the banks they decry. They\nare breaking rules on public order and\nshould be removed. So to anybody reading this whilst encamped on the steps of\nSt Paul\u2019s: go home, buy a suit, and get a\nproper job.\nfor some time, maybe without ever figuring it out. If you\u2019ve been in the same\nsituation, have figured it out or want to\nthink about it with me, or you just want\nto watch me trying to find the answer,\nhave a look at: twitter.com/vocalnerd \u2013\nand thanks for reading!\nSome say that the addition of a mask has made the new \u2018Where\u2019s Wally?\u2019\ntoo easy. Standards are slipping everywhere it seems\n\u201d\nI\u2019m sure some of\nyou have been\nwondering ... What\u2019s\nthe point of Twitter?\n\u201c\nI\u2019m sure\nI\u2019m sur\nyou hav\nyou hav\nJustus Schmidt\n\u201d\n... by night they\nwould rather desert\ntheir cause and\ntake advantage of\ntheir own ... homes\n\u201c\n... by n\n... by n\nwould r\nwould r\n\u201d\nI do, however,\ndisagree\nfundamentally with\nsimply occupying a\npublic area for an\nextended period of\ntime.\n\u201c\nI do, ho\nI do, ho\ndisagre\ndisagre\n\n"

Why? Where does\nthis aspiration to monogamy come from?\u201d\nSo runs the programme which I\u2019m given for\nRobert Gillespie\u2019s recent play Love, Question\nMark. I am intrigued: after all, what does push two\npeople together and incite them to spend the rest of\ntheir eternity in each other\u2019s companies? Marriage,\nlove, and sex: 3 age-old, hotly debated, feverishly\ncontested and quintessentially relevant concepts.\nAnd I was going to be seeing a play about them;\nhow could theatre possibly sound more enticing?\nWeopenwithMichaelSmith(Sessions),middleaged widower, musing on the definition of love.\n\u201c\u2018Bread\u2019, he argues \u2018is an idea we can all come to\nsome agreement about. But love? What on earth is\nlove?\u2019\u201d Prompted by a late sexual awakening, he\nquestions whether his content but insipid previous\nmarriage fits the bill. What follows is an hour of\npondering and debate on different questions relating to sex. Add to that the arrival of Maria (Cam-eron), a prostitute fromArgentina, shipped over for\nthe sole purpose of servicing Michael and we have\nwhat would appear to be a real forum of discussion\nbetween opposites: man and woman; social norm\nand social outcast. There are some truly challenging ideas raised too: violence, commitment in men,\nsexual experimentation vs. monogamous simplic-ity-- to name but a few, and all of these are fuelled\nwith quotes and excerpts that Michael reads from\nliterary authors, scientific thinkers, historical fig-The Poet\u2019s Column\nCome Fly With Me\nby Pavitar Devgon\n\u201cCome fly with me, come run a mile,\nAmong the vapour clouds.\nCome swim with me, across the sky\nCome and let us be.\u201d\n\u201cI shall not run, I shall not fly.\nI cannot be with thee.\nAlas,\u201d she said, \u201cmy deed is done,\nI cannot be with thee.\u201d\n\u201cThen let us ride into the night,\nGracious \u2019pon strong steeds.\nWith billowing hair, you\u2019d swiftly care\nTo come again with me.\u201d\n\u201cBut will you not consider the mare\nWho\u2019d work for only your pleasure?\nShould you not care for they who help,\nThey who work your measure.\nI shall not ride, I shall not trot\nFor you, I see, do surely not.\u201d\n\u201cPrivy, will you come to see\nThe work I do with honest glee;\nTo serenade the notes and strings.\nPrivy come, on swift paced wings.\u201d\n\u201cDo you ask because of art\nOr to soothe your fire?\nWill it be companionably\nOr will it end in mire?\u201d\n\u201cGood maiden, surely, I presume\nTo present most gentlemanly,\nTo doff my hat and turn my coat\nAnd whisper sweet words in thine ear.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you be so plainly wrong,\nTo think that tricks and guile\nCould ever get me out of sorts,\nOut of hours with wiles.\u201d\n\u201cI do not lie, \u2018tis honest word,\nWhat more can I say?\u201d\n\u201cJust promise to\nGive up the chase,\nAdmit defeat and leave my face.\u201d\n\u201cTo win your heart, I will comply\nJust as you prescribe.\nI take my leave, though \u2019t pains me so\nI shall leave this place.\u201d\nHe turned to leave and took a step\nWhen suddenly he heard a breath\nAnd turned to answer her hasty plea:\n\u201cWill you come and fly with me?\u201d\nFluent on Paper, apparently the first poetry night\nto take place in South Kensington, has been set up\nby last year\u2019s Felix editor Kadhim Shubber, and\nwill likely feature amateur poets from the univer-sity.\nIt must take some courage to get up in front of an\naudience of your peers and read words that come\nfrom the very depths of your soul (or at least from\nsomewhere rather deep and meaningful, one must\nhope). It is also something of an effort to listen to\nthese outpourings of feeling, however good they\nare. So, we decided to speak to Kadhim in order to\nfind out why this poetry evening would be worth\ngoing to, for both poets and audience members.\nYou write some poetry right? Is that why you\ndecided to set up this poetry evening?\nI decided to set up this poetry evening because for\nonceinsteadofalwaysgoingtostuffthatotherpeo-ple are organising, I wanted to sort of create something myself. The reason why its a poetry event,\ninstead of anything else, is that I love poetry and\nI really believe that it\u2019s something that needs to be\nshared in public, and out loud.\nWhy did you start writing poetry? And what\nmade you want to show it to other people?\nI started to write poetry three years ago because\nthere was a girl in my class who really enjoyed\npoetry and I wanted to impress her. Suffice it to\nsay, my poetry was a bit shit, and she wasn\u2019t very\nimpressed with it. The reason I started sharing it is\nbecause I wanted to know if it was any good and I\nwanted to share how I felt with other people, and\nhopefully connect with them.\nHave you ever read your poems at a poetry\nnight? Can you give any advice to those poets\ntaking part in Fluent on Paper?\nI haven\u2019t ever read my poetry in front of an audi-ence, so it will be as nervewracking for me as for\nanyone else, but it\u2019s going to be a friendly crowd\nso I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. I just want to ask people\nnot to be shy; because you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of\nsharing your emotions. Its something that should\nbe celebrated.\nIs it mainly Imperial Students taking part? Will\nyou have participants from other universities?\nIt\u2019s an open mic evening so I hope that the people\nwho come along will bring something different to\nshare with everyone. As well as that, I\u2019ve chosen\nthree poets to read their stuff. One is a recent Imperial graduate, the other is a friend of mine who\nstudies at Manchester and the third is a guy from\nCardiff who I met in India.\nWould you be alright with dramatic readings of\nfavourite poems for example?\nI really want it to be as inclusive as possible. Poetry\nis not just about expressing yourself in your own\nwords. Its also about someone else communicating an emotion in a way that connects with you.\nSo I am more than happy for people to read other\npeoples poems that they have enjoyed. As long as\nthey give credit to the poet of course!\nWhere is it going to be held?Anice place?\nAt a pub called The Builders Arms. I first went\nthere in second year and I think its probably the\nbest pub in this area. The inside is really stylish and\nthe beers are very good.\nAny final comments? Encouragements?\nDon\u2019t be put off. Its not going to be some pretentious douchefest. its just going to be a bunch of\nfriendly people drinking beers and reading poetry.\nIts going to be very down to earth and very non-judgemental.\nFluent on Paper; 20th November from 7pm to\n9pm at The Builders Arms, South Kensington\nLess love, more sex?\nRhyme, gentlemen please\nures and religious faces.The play, if not interesting,\nis at the very least informative.\nUnfortunately,muchliketherevelationof2009\u2019s\nNobel Peace Prize winner, this play was largely\nand undeniably underwhelming. The first half had\nthat astonishing quality of feeling rushed whilst remaining inherently stagnant. Ideas that would have\nmerited from a good ten minutes worth of discussion and synoptical action were glossed over in a\nquestion of seconds. Gillespie evidently suffered\nfrom the rare problem of having too much inspiration and his play seems to burst at the seams with\nall the questions he\u2019s ever wanted to ask about sex\n(notice, not so much love). It\u2019s a pity, that in asking\nso many, he ends up answering few. I abashedly\nhesitate to say in fact, none.The plotline is virtually\nnonexistent until the second half when there is suddenly a rush of action and excitement which leaves\nthe audience nothing short of bewildered. Most of\nall however, I\u2019m troubled by the conclusions, what\nfew of them there are anyway, that Gillespie seems\nto come to. Dare I say it\u2019s pessimistic to assume\nthat all men may want out of any and every relationship is \u2018to cum and keep on cumming\u2019? Or that\neach and every man shirks from commitment, particularly that ultimate and inevitable one: parent-hood? On the subject of marriage itself, he seems\nto resolve that it\u2019s just a struggle to relive those first\nsix weeks of bliss, that honeymoon period but that\neventually all it becomes is \u2018the hell of familiarity\nand boredom\u2019. But is it safe to assume that every\nmarriage is just that?\nDespite the limitations of the script, I have to\nhand it to the actors for their thoroughly commendable performances. Stuart Sessions succeeds in\naccurately portraying the Everyman character of\nMichael Smith without failing to keep the audience\nengaged (I didn\u2019t notice my attention wandering\nonce in the two hours) and his comic timing is impeccable throughout. Clare Cameron meanwhile\nboasts a sizzling and somewhat terrifying stage\npresence, albeit the sometimes off-putting discrepancies in her Spanish accent are.\nAlthough undoubtedly thought provoking, it\npains me to describe this production as unremark-able.As you\u2019d expect from its title, Love, Question\nMark raises enough questions, but the answers lack\nthedepthanddevelopmentneededfortheaudience\nto leave feeling edified. Whilst I\u2019d never want to\nincrease The Sun\u2019s circulation, Gillespie\u2019s play is\nsomething of a glorified Dear Deidre column and\nwith tickets selling at sixty times the price of the\nred top, it isn\u2019t really sixty times better.\nLove, Question Mark runs at the Tabard Theatre until 23 November\nEva Rosenthal\nFelix Arts is constantly looking for new\npoets. If you want to see your work appearing here, do get in touch.

This week we feature\nthe Captain of the Imperial College\nRugby Union Football Club (to give\nhim his full title), Charlie Esberger.\nWe manage to meet up briefly on\nWednesday, just before the 1sts match\nagainst St Bart\u2019s and the Royal London Hospitals 1st. At the time of the\ninterview, ICRUFC were sitting mid-table in the South Eastern 1A division,\nwhile St Bart\u2019s were first.\nHis thoughts on the afternoon\u2019s\nmatch? \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a close one,\nthe last time we played them we dominated but threw away some points towards the end and lost it.\u201d Definitely\nup for a spot of revenge then. (In the\nevent, the match is an emphatic win as\nIC run away with it, 59-10 \u2013 Ed.)\nI ask him how the start of the season has gone for the first XV. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nplayed four matches so far, and won\nthree of those. We were disappointed\nto lose a tight match to St Bart\u2019s (as\nmentioned above \u2013 Ed.) but followed\nthat up with a great win against St\nMary\u2019s. We all hate St Mary\u2019s, none\nmore so than our coach Birkett.\u201d\nAny particular reason for the animos-ity? \u201cThey\u2019re just really gobby \u2013 they\nthink they\u2019re the dog\u2019s bollocks. Also,\nwe\u2019ve had some good, physical games\nagainst them in the past.\u201d Ah, nothing\nlike a good rivalry to spice things up\na bit (although Charlie tells me Portsmouth aren\u2019t very high up his list of\nfriends either).\nWhile the firsts are evidently doing\nwell, having now won four out of five,\nI ask about the fortunes of the other IC\nRugby teams.\n\u201cThe 2nd XV have had a decent start,\nand sit second in their league (South\nEastern 3B \u2013 Ed.). They\u2019re pushing to\ngo back up after relegation last season.\nThe 3rd XV have started slowly, but\nwill push on from here.\u201d\nAs he mentioned that the 2nd team\nare aiming for re-promotion, I ask\nwhat the team\u2019s objectives are for this\nseason. They have finished second in\ntheir division for the past two years,\nand Charlie seems determined to get\nit this year: \u201cObviously this season\nwe want to go up. We\u2019re trying to\nmake every session count by making\nsure everyone is there and organising\nthings to target specific areas of our\ngameplay.\u201d\n\u201cWe train Monday and Friday eve-nings, while the 1st XV forwards also\ndrill the lineout on Tuesday morn-ings. We have 4 coaches: Rich Birkett\n\u2013 current Wasps 2nd row (Heineken\nCup & Premiership winner); Brimah\nKebbie, who is a club legend and has\nbeen around longer than anyone can\nremember, an ex-rugby league pro-fessional; Ed Burt, who specialises\nin video analysis and is employed by\nWasps; finally Joe Brown who graduated from here in 2010 and now plays\nfor Esher in the championship.\u201d I can\u2019t\nhelp but be impressed at the depth of\nthe coaching staff. Surely the 1sts will\nget promotion this year.\nHaving said that, a team is only as\ngood as its players. Has anyone distinguished themselves so far this season?\n\u201cSean Baker is a complete animal\non the pitch and has been excellent.\nProbably player of the season so far,\nplayed across the back row and even\nfilled in at loosehead. Billy & Hugh G\nhave also been omnipresent and made\na massive difference on and off the\npitch.\u201d Evidently the captain thinks\nhighly of his men.\nAs far as the off-pitch aspect is con-cerned, we all know the rugby lads\nknow how to make themselves heard\nat ACC nights. I ask Charlie how the\nnew bar night policy affects the club\nand what he thinks about it. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow the ins and outs of the situation,\u201d\nhe says, \u201cbut it strikes me as a shame.\nMaybe changes were necessary, but\nthe vast majority of people think it has\ngone too far. The most the most frustrating thing is when the policy makers\nrepeatedly try and fob us off \u2013 people\naren\u2019t stupid.\u201d\nTurning back to the lighter side of\nthings, I get the captain to tell a bit\nmore about himself. A fourth-year\nphysicist, he started playing rugby at\nschool, at Trent College. Has it always\nbeen this serious?\n\u201cEverybody took it seriously there,\nso I guess I always have and just continued on with that at Imperial.\u201d\nFinally, being French, and with the\nWorld Cup just over, I can\u2019t resist\npicking his brains on England\u2019s per-Essential info:\nCharlie Esberger, 21\n106 kg, 6\u20194\u201d\n10 years\u2019 playing experience\nPhysics 4th year\nLikes: Sausage & grazing, Players over 100kg\nDislikes: Backs dropping the ball, St Mary\u2019s,\nPortsmouth, coming 2nd\nformance. Does he think Martin Johnson is doing a decent job, despite what\ncould be called an \u2018early\u2019 exit? \u201cWell,\nover the course of Johnson\u2019s reign\nwe\u2019ve definitely improved. I guess his\nchallenge is to motivate the players he\nhas, and find the new ones to keep on\nimproving ahead of the Six Nations\nand ultimately the next World Cup. I\nthink some of his selections surprised\nsome people, squad and teams as well\nas substitutions.\u201d Not condemnation,\nbut not entirely approval, either.\nGood luck to ICRUFC for the season\nahead, and here\u2019s to promotion!\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9 10\n11 12 12\n13\n13 14 15 15 16\n16 16\n17 18 18 19 19 20\n19 21\n20 21 23 22 23 24\n25\n24 25 27\n26 29\n10\n11 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26\n26\n28\n22\n17\n14\nClub Captain Interview:\nRugby\n\n"

Despite\nconsciously leaving out\ncelebrities as inspirational\nfashion figures in her writ-ing, her own celeb status\nis global.\nHer blog, launched in\nMarch 2006, is a personal\nonline diary: a collection of\nher daily thoughts on the\nlatest fashion events and\nnew collections, alongside\nwhere she is, what she\u2019s\ndoing, and, most impor-tantly, what she\u2019s wearing.\nWhile big names (such as\nPrada and Balenciaga) pop\nup from time to time, Susie loves to expose under-the-radar talent from fresh\ndesigners. Photography\nplays a large role in every\npost, whether it\u2019s outfits\n(snapped by her boyfriend,\nfellow blogger of Style Salvage, on their famous Holloway balcony) or general\ninspiration posts.\nHer personal avant-garde\nstyle is impossible to cat-egorise, though a minimalist she certainly is not. She\nmixes an eclectic collection of vintage, high street\nand independent designer\npieces, layering contrasting patterns, textures and\ncolours. While her style is\nconstantly evolving, her\nsignature blunt fringe and\ninnocent expression remain constant. She often\nuses her legs as her best\naccessory, whether they\u2019re\nbare, or covered with\nopaques; she maintains\nher winter staple is a pair\nof John Lewis school uniform ribbed grey tights.\nThe blog also includes\nher famous \u2018London Shop\nMap\u2019, an extensive guide to\nLondon\u2019s unique shopping\nexperience, which includes\neverything from department store favourites like\nSelfridges and Liberty, and\ndesigners like Acne and\nMarc Jacobs, to East London vintage boutiques and\nKensington charity shops.\nAs a brand in her own right,\nshe has associations with\nrecognisable names such\nas Elle and Topshop, whilst\nnever forgetting the importance of blogs.

Unfortunately, it is on days like these,\nwhen we most crave the\nglossy pages of the likes\nof Vogue, i-D and Numero,\nthat we are faced with the\ndaunting reality that these\nmonthlies are no longer\naffordable, thanks to our\nlatest shopping extrava-ganza.\nAs a result, we turn trust-ingly to our good friend,\nthe internet. Amongst\nall those girls prancing\naround so casually and\nperfectly in high fashion\nevents looking every bit\nthe epitome of what we\nenvy, and all those sites\nlinked to those physical\npublications we so desperately desire, cries out a\nspark of excitement in the\nonline magazine.\nOnline magazines are\ntypically devoid of any content worth our precious\nprocrastination time due\nto a lack of funding and\nexposure, except in the\ncase of The Ones 2 Watch.\nIn fact, as the little sister\nof the online fashion giant\nMODELS.com, the popularity The Ones 2 Watch has\ngained since it launched\na year ago has bought\nhoards of contributors who\nare nothing less than awe\ninspiring, talented, creative geniuses.\nEach monthly issue is\nfilled with unexpected orig-inality. A hunger for beauty\nand perfection is the only\nthing in common throughout each issue despite a\nmonthly set theme. Take,\nfor example, September\u2019s\nissue \u2018Stay Beautiful\u2019\nwhich evokes nothing less\nthan pure love towards an\nalluring Paul Boche in the\ncalmly surreal shoot \u2018Pale\n& Interesting\u2019, contrasted\nagainst the yearning for extravagant luxury provoked\nby the image of models\ndrowning in the pleasure of\ntheir own reflection in \u2018The\nRoyal Palace\u2019.\nIn fact, The Ones 2\nWatch has turned into\nsomewhat of a guilty plea-sure. Their aim was to\nshowcase upcoming talent from across the globe,\nand they have succeeded\nwithout pretentiousness,\ngiving just enough to set\nyour thoughts ablaze, allowing the imagination to\nrun wild, almost as if in the\nknowledge that we want\nnothing less than a total\nescape.\nAlice Yang\nTextbook\n(textbook.tumblr.com)\nThe Ones 2 Watch\n(theones2watch.com)\nAs a follower of fashion\nblogs since they first appeared on the industry\u2019s\nradar some five years ago,\nI confess I have become\nsomething of a blog-snob.\nPersonal style blogs are\nnow ten to the dozen, with\nhundreds of wannabe Rumi\nNeelies and Jane Aldridges\nclogging up the blogroll of\nthose whose interest is\nin the close observation\nof beautiful, modelesque\ngirls with perfect hair and\ndeeply enviable ward-robes. And if your interest\nsways towards capturing\nthe everyday moments of\nsartorial glory, the holy\ntrinity of street-style re-mains: Scott Schuman\n(thesartorialist.com), Garance Dor\u00e9 (garancedore.\nfr/en) and Tommy Ton\n(jakandjil.com), whose hallowed cameras point only\nat the select super-stylish\nfew, though presently the\nfield is congested with\nDSLR-owners whose taste\ndoesn\u2019t yet quite cut the\nsartorial mustard. There\nis now an established elite\nwithin the blogosphere,\nwhich some would say\ndefeats the object of blogging \u2013 it is, after all, about\nindividuals sharing ideas in\na free, public forum. Alas,\nsuch is the nature of the in-dustry: elitism omnia vincit.\nSo imagine my delight\nwhen I find (on Tumblr, of\nall things!) a blog with a\ntruly unique vision: Textbook. A style blog for history and literature. The\npremise? Each post is a\nstylish imagining of what\na fictional, historical or\neven a video game character would wear if they\nwere living today. The au-thor, John Jannuzzi, works\nat Lucky magazine in New\nYork, but the project is\nquite apart from his day\njob. He writes: \u201cEver read\na book and formed a perfect image of the character in your head? So have\nI, and that\u2019s why I started\nthis blog.\u201d Simply put, one\nby one, the Jannuzzi puts\nevery well-known character\nimaginable in a selection\nof three fantastic editorial ensembles: there\u2019s\nAnne Boleyn in Alexander\nMcQueen, Dorian Gray in\nDolce and Gabanna, Belle\nof Beauty and the Beast\nin Erdem and, a personal\nfavourite, Lady Macbeth in\nGivenchy, with the byline:\n\u201cDuncan is here for dinner...\u201d\nA blog for all the sartorially fabulous who could\nimagine that, of course,\nif Rasputin were alive and\nfashion-forward today, he\nwould totally be wearing\nRick Owens.

Of\nthese, the last two can attribute the spread of\nthe virus mainly to injecting drug use, whilst\nthe other four states to sexual transmission.\nAnyone who has tried to conduct a survey\ninto the lives of sex workers will know that\npitfalls abound in this kind of research. In my\nproject, I was making a model looking at HIV\nand genital herpes. I was essentially trying to\nfigure out whether having one virus made you\nbiologically more susceptible to the other, or\nwhether if you had one, you were just more\nlikely to get the other, because you catch both\nin the same way: through having unprotected\nsex. Collecting data on sex workers and in particular HIV is never easy, due to the huge stigmas associated with them. Sex workers themselves are relatively easy to find, if you know\nwhere to look, where to find the brothels. Their\nclients \u2013 normal working men, often married\nones \u2013 are perhaps less forthcoming.\nCondom use is a really important parameter\nin most HIV and STI models, as of course the\nrate of condom use can really tell you how well\ncondoms are preventing the spread of the vi-rus, and how good the prevention services are\nat getting them to the relevant people. One\ninteresting fact we found in our data was that\nwhilst clients reported condom usage of between 54\u201383%, the sex workers reported usage\nof 76\u201399%. But hang on \u2013 aren\u2019t the sex workers and the clients having sex with each other?\nSo, if they are telling the truth, shouldn\u2019t their\nreported figures be exactly the same?\nThe massive difference between the reported\ncondom usage from sex workers and from their\nclients is likely to be a form of response bias.\nThis is where someone answers a question in\nthe way they think the questioner wants them\nto answer. So, imagine for a second that you\u2019re\na sex worker in Bangalore. The Avahan project\nis doing everything it can to give you condoms\nand to encourage you to use them as much as\npossible. Then a researcher from the Avahan\nproject turns up with a clipboard and asks you,\nexpectant look on his face, how many times\nyou have had unprotected sex with a client\nin the last week. You\u2019re pretty unlikely to say\nSex, the city and HIV\nMaya Kaushik discusses the Master\u2019s project that forced her to look at her\nhometown of Bangalore in a completely different way\nWant to write for Felix\nScience? Email us at\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cseveral times\u201d. In some districts sex workers\nhad reported condom usage of 99%, which is\nhighly unlikely to be true, as if this was the\ncase there would be no HIV problem in the\nregion at all.\nSo how does one create a model when you\ncan\u2019t trust the data? Well, you just have to use\nyour best guesstimate, which is often just the\naverage of what the sex workers have reported and what the clients have reported. Other\nbehavioural data, which may or may not be\nmore reliable, include the length of time the\nsex worker has been active in that role and the\nnumber of sexual partnerships she has had in\nthe last week.\nThe results from the models seem to show\nthat HIV and genital herpes do have some\nbiological interaction, and the fact that one increases with the other isn\u2019t just down to the sex\nworkers\u2019 behaviour patterns. The whole study\nof HIV shows just how complex the spread of\nthis virus is \u2013 down to behaviour, biological\ninteractions with other STIs, and the problems\nthat arise when trying to get information on\nthese particular groups of people. The Avahan\nproject has dramatically increased outreach to\nhigh-risk people in these Indian states; its work\non condom distribution, peer-to-peer outreach,\nand STI testing and treatment is a great step\ntowards combating the spread of HIV in India.\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nLal Bagh botanical gardens, amongst others, gives Bangalore its nice nickname, but it is also has a more sinister side...\nStrawberries should be one of\nboozers\u2019 five-a-day\nSucculent strawberries are more than just a summertime treat.

A few\nminutes after being shown into a modest meeting room on the top floor of\nthe building, Adrian Shooter, CBE and\nChairman of Chiltern Railways, enters,\napologising for the delay.\nMr Shooter\u2019s story is well known.\nHaving effectively managed Chiltern\nRailways for over 20 years, during\nwhich he successfully completed a management buyout of the company, it now\nruns as one of the most punctual UK train\noperators.\nMr Shooter\u2019s interest in the rail industry was sparked by the debate surrounding the Beeching Report, released when\nMr Shooter was still at school. The report\ncalled for the closure of a third of Britain\u2019s train stations and the reorganisation\nof existing tracks in order to fully reshape Britain\u2019s railways. This prompted\nmuch controversy and general public\ncriticism, but young Adrian agreed with\nLord Beeching\u2019s propositions comparing\nthe scenario to a rose bush: \u201cyou have to\nprune off the dead branches and encourage the new shoots of growth.\u201d\nAfter obtaining a degree in Mechanical\nEngineering from North Staffordshire\nPolytechnic, Mr Shooter joined British\nRail in 1970 as an Engineering Management Trainee. During his 12 years in the\nrole, Mr Shooter primarily worked on\ndeveloping and improving the operations\nand efficiency of the company.\n\u201cIt was a huge company with exciting\nchanges taking place so there was real\nopportunity for young engineers to be\ninvolved. At the time, the IC 125, which\nwas the fastest diesel train in the world\nat the time and still runs now, was being\nbrought in meaning that we had to build\nnew depots as well as recruit and retrain\n300-odd people. Through the whole 12\nyears, my job was about bringing change\nand modernising the way we do things,\nwhich was really exciting.\u201d\nMr Shooter recalls his first direct\ncontact with British Rail passengers in\nHarpenden following 2 years of constant\ndisruptions to the railway system due to\ntrack and station upgrades: \u201cThe commuters were pretty cross as the whole\njourney had been thinned out and lots of\nreplacement buses had been used. When\nI went to give a speech at their village\nhall, packed with over 300 people, they\nwere baying for blood.\n\u201cTo start off with, it was a big shouting match, but then some people in the\naudience turned on the people who were\nshouting and said \u2018Hey look, give the\nbloke a chance.\u2019 We were just about to\nbring in new trains and a new service, so\nI told them that if it doesn\u2019t improve over\nthe next couple of months, then they\u2019d\nbe entitled to be after my blood. In the\nend, it was really good because a few of\nthem then took me down the pub for a\ndrink and we delivered what we said we\nwould \u2013 improving our punctuality to the\nbest in the country \u2013 meaning that these\ncommuters were fully satisfied with the\nservice.\n\u201cI really enjoyed that because it\u2019s really\nimportant that engineers realise they can\nmake changes. To be interfacing directly\nwith customers \u2013 the people who are going to put their hands in their pockets to\npay for what you\u2019re doing \u2013 doesn\u2019t half\nconcentrate your mind.\u201d\nFollowing the legislation in 1993 to\nprivatise railways, Mr Shooter was asked\nby the Chairman of British Rail to come\nto Chiltern Railways and make it into a\nseparate company \u2013 a completely self-standing financial entity.\n\u201cThis was more difficult than it sounds.\nThere were contracts and agreements to\nbe written out. Who was to be responsible for looking after the stations? What\nwould happen if there were a conflict\nbetween running times of passenger and\nfreight trains? It got much too complicated but, nevertheless, worked out in\nthe end. The next step was to sell the\ncompany.\u201d\nHaving worked for so long with his\nmanagement team on building up the\ncompany, Mr Shooter felt that they could\nrun it as well as anyone else, and so decided to try and undertake a management\nbuyout \u2013 a process that is very rarely suc-cessful.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather interesting as I was actually\nworking for British Railways who were\nselling Chiltern Railways, so I had a conflict of interest. I had to do three things.\nFirstly, I had to continue running the railways in a proper, prompt and safe way.\nSecondly, on behalf of my employer, I\nhad to sell the business \u2013 it was competitive and we had 13 companies bidding\nfor it. I had to explain to prospective purchasers how the company worked, what\nthey would need to do and the money\nthey should pay for it. Thirdly, in my\nown time, I had to work out, with my\nteam, how to buy it.\u201d\nAfter formally winning the franchise in\n1996, Mr Shooter and his team devised a\nlong term plan for the company which is\nstill on-going today.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown the business faster than\nany of the other companies. We\u2019ve done\nthat because railways, like many other\nbusinesses, survive on their customers.\nYou\u2019ve got to find out what customers\nwant and, importantly, what they\u2019re prepared to pay for.\u201d\nMr Shooter rounds up his story by explaining \u201csuccess in business is all about\nthe people. It\u2019s about making sure you\nhave the right people in the right teams\nwith a very clear objective about what\nyou\u2019re trying to achieve. If you look at\n\u201cWe tend to recruit\npeople for attitude\nand then train them\nfor skills.\u201d\nMr Shooter\u2019s Darjeeling Himalayan Steam Locomotive \u2013 in his own back garden\nsomething that\u2019s gone wrong, one of the\nfirst questions you might want to ask is\n\u2018was there a clear objective?\u2019 Secondly\n\u2018did all the people who were involved\nin that understand the objective?\u2019 And\nthirdly, \u2018did they buy into it?\u2019\u201d\nRegarding hiring people to make up\nsuch a team, Mr Shooter looks for \u201cpeople who are enthusiastic and are committed to working as a team. We tend to\nrecruit people for attitude and then train\nthem for skills. I want people who are\ngoing to come here and look as if they\nare enthusiastic and interested and want\nto get on and do stuff, but tempered with\nwhatever are the appropriate qualifications for whatever the job may be.\u201d\nAdded to this, Mr Shooter\u2019s passion\nfor the rail industry is reflected in his\nownership of a Darjeeling Himalayan\nSteam Locomotive, along with 600 yards\nof railway track in the back yard of his\nBicester home. \u201cI\u2019ve always quite liked\ntwo-foot gauge railways and when I became aware that this would be for sale I\nknew it would be the only Darjeeling Himalayan Steam Locomotive ever likely\nto come out of India, so I brought it to\nthe UK, had it overhauled and got some\nreplica coaches that go with it.\u201d\nHowever, neither being awarded a\nCBE nor owning a Darjeeling Himalayan Steam Locomotive in his back\ngarden are classed by Mr Shooter as his\ngreatest life achievements to date. \u201cThe\nthing I\u2019m most proud of, is that over the\nyears, we\u2019ve managed to develop Chiltern Railways into something which is a\nmuch more valuable contribution to the\ncommunity than it was.\u201d\nTaking into account his great list of\nachievements and contributions to the\nrail and engineering industry, I ask Mr\nShooter what advice he would give to\ncurrent students, and what skills he feels\nare most important for success.\n\u201cThey need two sorts of skills. If\nthey\u2019re mechanical engineers, they\u2019ve\nprobably embarked upon that because\nthey have some interest in machines and\nhow machines work. The real advice I\nwould give to them is about honing your\npeople skills.\n\u201cOnce at university, make sure you\nfind yourself in one of the various extra\ncurricular activities where you have the\nopportunity to get on the committee for\nit, and volunteer for some kind of role\nwhere you\u2019ll have to do things and organise people. Even if you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it, get yourself as social\nsec or the like.\n\u201cMake sure you spend time in companies in your vacations. Write to companies or whatever connections you\u2019ve got\nand see what it\u2019s actually like at work.\n\u201cOn top of that, study hard and get the\nbest possible degree you can.\u201d\nAdrian Shooter CBE\nInterview: Adrian Shooter\n\u201cThe advice I would\ngive is about honing\nyour people skills.\u201d\nAlice Yang talks to the Chairman of Chiltern Railways about careers in industry\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nBottled water uses up to 2000 times more energy than tap water \u2013 GREEN WEEK 2011.
