    "content": "2. Jaws\nAnother Spielberg entry (don\u2019t get tired of him just yet, he still has plenty\nmore on this list), he is the man to blame if you have a phobia of sharks\nor oceans in general. Before the days of fancy computer graphics, Spielberg\u2019s vision of a series of shark attacks on men terrified so many of us\nthat coupled with John Williams\u2019 unforgettable score, Jaws has become\nan essential viewing despite its uninspired sequels.\n3. The Sting\nCoupling two of the hottest (both in terms of looks and talent) actors\nworking back in the day, Paul Newman and Robert Redford formed one\nheck of a hustling team conning a ruthless criminal banker. Winner of\nseven Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Sting is possibly the\nmost likable film of all time, which would explain the sensational boxoffice receipts this raked in.\n4. Jurassic Park\nYes, this is another Spielberg achievement. Whenever you see a glass\nof vibrating water, do you immediately jump to the likelihood that dinosaurs may be on the loose? Thank Mr Spielberg once again for instilling\nsuch fear in you. One of the greatest blockbusters of all time, you owe\nit to yourself to sit through the thrill ride of your life, as troublesome\ncreatures lurk around every corner.\n5. Airport\nA mass ensemble disaster piece, the cast is quite astonishing, consisting the likes of (deep breath) Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Jean Seberg,\nJacqueline Bisset, George Kennedy, Helen Hayes, Van Heflin, Maureen\nStapleton, among others. Airport has the reputation of being the first to\ninvent the disaster film genre, but looking back today, the film is over-long, full of ageing stars and lacks genuine thrills.\n1. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\nIt hardly comes as a surprise that the much-beloved alien offering from\nthe Steven Spielberg takes the top spot as biggest money-maker. The\ntechnological accomplishments amaze even to this day, but what E.T.\ndoes successfully in its story-telling is to have a heart. \u201cPhone home\u201d\nhas become an iconic line, and this has garnered interest as being actress Drew Barrymore\u2019s acting debut, who was barely 7.\n6. American Graffiti\nForget American Pie, George Lucas\u2019 1973 Best Picture nominated teenage dramedy is one of the most influential, significant coming-of-age\nfilms of all time. It kick-started the acting careers of Harrison Ford,\nRon Howard and Richard Dreyfuss, and this bittersweet, rather touching\nreflection of impending high-school graduates is a highly memorable\npiece. A timeless portrayal on what it means to grow up.\n7. National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House\nThis remains to be one of the most profitable films of all time, given\nits modest budget and huge returns. Despite its mixed reviews upon\nrelease, director John Landis\u2019 hilarious tale, in which a group of misbehaving fraternity brothers plan a revolution against the dean of their\ncollege who threaten to evict them, has since become a fan-favourite,\nfirmly holding its position as one of the best comedies of all time.\n8. Back to the Future\nNo doubt the exceptional Michael J. Fox\u2019s most well-known and celebrated roles, this is an example of that rare hybrid of action, adventure\nand sci-fi which both harsh film critics and the public absolutely adore.\nThe energy with which its brilliantly constructed narrative takes place\nis exhilarating, and the script doesn\u2019t forget to include some killer humour in the midst of all the insane spirit.\n9. Smokey and the Bandit\nOne of Burt Reynolds\u2019 most iconic roles, his Bo \u201cBandit\u201d Darville is the\nfull embodiment of the 70s hipster American lad, laying back with his\nno-nonsense demeanour, thick moustache and riding fancy cars. The\nfinancial success brought about two sequels and even a spin-off television series. Although originally planned as a B-movie, this went on to\nbecome the fourth highest grossing film of the year.\n10. The Lost World: Jurassic Park\nThought you were done with Spielberg? Not quite. The tenth highest\nhonour on this list goes to the sequel (shock horror!) following Spielberg\u2019s epic dinosaur disaster piece. Although everyone agrees this\ndoesn\u2019t capture the magic and creative genius Spielberg managed with\nhis original, the hype surrounding the sequel was clearly strong enough\nto propel this to its number 10 spot.\nFELIX\nFriday 11 MAY 2012\n22\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM\nCelebrating 100 year\nYou might have noticed slight changes made in the usual logos of Universal and Paramount Studios.

It is not looming over us at all but it is\njust better not to really. I am sure once it comes\nto it I will be very excited by it.\nM: What festivals have you got planned?\nJ: I am looking forward to Benicassim in\nSpain, it is always nice to get some sunshine.\nThey have just changed our set-time to half\none in the morning which will be fun. The\ncrowd should be truly warmed up by that stage,\nI would hope. The festival I am most excited\nabout is Hultsfred because I have never been to\nSweden before.\nM: I have heard rumours of an upcoming\nEP...\nJ: I wasn\u2019t aware that we were making an EP\u2026\nThat\u2019s the first I\u2019ve heard of it. Maybe they\nare making it without me. We are kind of busy\ntouring right now. We are going to America in\nthe summer. Maybe we will write an actual album then.\nM:Any chance you will do anything acoustic\nagain, like Flaws?\nJ: Yeah. It would be nice but probably not the\nwhole album; probably just the b-sides to it.\nMaybe an EP, that\u2019s a good idea. We will have\nto give you credit for coming up with that idea.\nM: Do you think that being quite young acts\nagainst you?\nJ: I haven\u2019t noticed it. Let me think. When we\nstarted out, there was always that compliment\nof \u2018oh they are so good for their age\u2019which gets\na bit tiresome after a while. But nowadays we\nare not that young. I don\u2019t feel young. I feel\nincredibly old. I am 22.\nM: That is still quite young.\nJ: Not in my mind.\nM: Are you still living the rock and roll life-style?\nJ: I think everyone else is. I am certainly not.\nThe others seem to be partying a lot more.\nThere has been some disgraceful evenings but I\nhave only heard of them.\nM: Is it hard when making a set-list to combine all the distinct albums?\nJ: It is very difficult. It is hard to play all of the\nloud stuff and then go into the acoustic album.\nI think for people that come to our shows, that\ndon\u2019t really know us before they are very confused because we play all of this weird different shit. But for the people that know us, they\nknow what to expect.\nM: Do you ever lie during interviews?\nJ: Sometimes but you always have to realise\nthat it is so tempting to be an areshole but you\nBombay fever hits London\nhave to be really grateful for all this. I guess it\nis easy to do it because it gets repetitive some-times, but you should always treat people with\nrespect.\nM: You came straight out of school. Are you\nglad you missed out on university?\nJ: I am so glad I didn\u2019t go. I had a place at\nManchester. My girlfriend is there, she is just\nfinishing having done a three year course. I\nspend a lot of time there and I am not sure if I\nwould have enjoyed it. The whole idea of making friends all over again sounds quite stressful,\nreally. I was going to do French which I\u2019d still\nlike to learn, but not at university. It sounds like\nquite an intense place to be. Lots of ups and\ndowns; pressure and loneliness. I am not one\nof those social people who parties all the time.\nFor them it sounds wonderful, but I am too shy.\nM: Is it true that you guys got banned from a\nfew hotels for being naked in the reception?\nJ: Yeah, that\u2019s embarrassingly true. I feel like\nwe have it all out of our systems at an early age\nand now we have mellowed out a lot. You have\nto get all that shit over and done with while you\nare still young. Now I am happy to never do\nany of that ever again.\nM: And you are only 22\u2026\nJ: My life has all been squeezed into the space\nof thirty years so in a few years I will be an\nold man. I will be properly elderly. Dementia,\nAlzheimer\u2019s. And then that will be it!\nAnd on that sombre note I left to let the band\nprepare for a historic night in the capital.\nMark England catches up with Bombay Bicycle Club\nShellac are another great Math Rock band. You\nmay know them for including prolific producer\nSteve Albini, or you may know them for the sound,\nwhich is pretty much abrasion itself. From the\ndistorted, almost noisy guitars, to the vocals, aggressively shouted, often about violence and fighting and more often than not bitter, sarcastic and\nunpleasant. They formed in 1992, after Albini\u2019s\ninvolvement in Big Black and Rapeman, who are\nboth somewhat important to math. It is with no\ndisrespect to these bands, however, that I say that\nShellac is the culmination of Albini\u2019s work.\nThe band started out as a collaboration between Albini, on guitar and vocals and drummer\nTodd Trainer. They were later joined by bassist Bob\nWeston, who also does some vocals and, like Albini, is a recording engineer. This is perhaps what\nled the band to make some very specific decisions about their recording set up. They opt for a\nmore analogue sound seldom, if ever, using over-dubs. Albini\u2019s signature crunch is in large part due\nto his use of a rare aluminium body guitar with a\ncopper plectrum, as well as a \u201cHarmonic Percolator\u201d distortion pedal.\nIn summary, heavily distorted guitar, surreal,\nbrutal but always intelligent lyrics, complex time\nsignatures and rhythms and structural unconven-tionality. That is Shellac\u2019s sound and they do it\nwell. They have released four albums to date; 94\u2019s\nAt Action Park, \u201898\u2019s Terraform, 2000\u2019s 1000 Hurts,\n2007\u2019s Excellent Italian Greyhound. Throughout\ntheir long career their sound has changed remarkably little, merely honing their existing sound.\nTheir sound and their output, four albums in\ntwenty years, show a lot about the band. This is\nthe uncompromising nature of the band\u2019s ethos.\nThey care little for the corporate realities of the\nmusic business today, refusing to temper their\nsound to a larger audience or to be forced to adhere to any kind of label deadline. This lack of desire for material success is reflected in the band\u2019s\ncontinuing to have other jobs, leaving Shellac\u2019s\nsound uncompromised. Furthermore, they refuse\nto sell tickets to their gigs through any company\nthat adds additional charges. The band\u2019s strong\nethics are further demonstrated by an anecdote\nabout their curating an ATP\n. Knowing most fans\nwould be there to see them, they insisted on playing first thing in the morning to force festival goers to see the other bands.\nIt is not hard to see why those who like Shellac\nlove them; refusal to sell out, respect (where due)\nfor other bands and for their fans. Oh, and for their\nbrand of best noise rock/punk tinged math rock, a\ndistinctive sound they refuse to compromise but\nonly hone and improve with each release.\nRiaz Agahi\nPt. II - Shellac\nEveryone in this photo looks very happy and relaxed, apart from Mr Serious on the left . Cheer up son\nReturning heroes triumphant at theAlly Pally\nThis was my first time at the epic venue which\nis Alexandra Palace and I was not disappoint-ed. With support from Rae Morris and Lianne\nla Havves, the evening had a solid start but it\nwas the first few songs of Bombay Bicycle\nClub\u2019s set that really kicked the show into gear.\nThe set was largely composed of songs from\nthe most recent album and the bands\u2019 debut,\nwith classics such as \u2018Open House\u2019 and \u2018Dust\non the Ground\u2019 mixing well with more recent\nhits like \u2018How Can You Swallow So Much\nSleep?\u2019. Only two songs were played from\ntheir acoustic folk tinged second album Flaws,\nwhich I thought was a shame but they ended up\nbeing the highlight of the night for me.\nI found that the moments where beautiful\nsongstress Lucy Rose provided backing vo-cals, especially on \u2018Still\u2019 which was perfomed\nstripped down with only a piano for accompa-niment. It was a fragile, heart-breaking moment which was shared by, what seemed to be,\nthe whole of London packed inside the Palace,\nhushed in reverence.\nThe song which the whole audience was\nwaiting for, \u2018Shuffle\u2019, was played triumphantly during the brief encore. Everyone seized on\nthis song to sway, jump and bounce around to\nthe baggy drums and funky bass riff in a moment of sheer joy.\nThis show only validated my opinion that\nBombay Bicycle Club are ready for bigger\nstages, even if they themselves told me that\nthey are very unambitious. I heard rumours circulating that they could headline Reading and\nLeeds next year, and at first I could not picture\nit, but after that accomplished performance,\nsuch feats seem inevitable to me.\nMark England\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 11 MAy 2012 15\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nF\nirstly, let me clarify \u2013 I am\nnot a hipster.\nI feel compelled to begin\nwith that statement because\nafter reading this article,\nyou may come to the conclusion that I\nam a hipster. I assure you I am not. You\nwill not catch me wearing an inordinate amount of wool, or styling thick-rimmed glasses in spite of my 20/20 vi-sion, or listening to awful music whose\nonly attraction is that no one has ever\nheard of it. Indeed, it is my belief that\nwhen the final bell tolls and Ragnarok\nrages across the Earth, I will be locked\nin a battle to the death with the King of\nthe Hipsters.\nI had to start with that caveat because\nI do not follow the crowd. In most cases of mainstream, I am actively fighting against the current like some freethinking salmon, or paddling down my\nown isolated tributary.\nI have many examples. Harry Potter, to start with. I\u2019ve read four of the\nbooks but only after the glorious \u2018new\nbook\u2019 smell has faded from between\nthe covers of a library dustjacket.\nBy this time, revelations like \u201cSnape\nkills Dumbledore! OMG!\u201d were old\nnews and held no more shock appeal.\nOh, spoiler alert, I guess. I\u2019m better\nwith the film, having seen seven out\nof eight, because I\u2019ve got no problem\nwith watching a good film. Maybe because I wasn\u2019t swept along in the initial\nwave of hype and hyperbole but I can\u2019t\nI am not a hipster \u2013 it\u2019s too mainstream\nsee anything extraordinary about Harry\nPotter. Good books, yes, but amazing,\nmaybe not.\nThe same can be said for The Girl\nwith the Dragon Tattoo, George R. R.\nMartin and most recently The Hunger\nGames. Unlike the majority of London\nUnderground commuters, I\u2019ve yet to\ncrack the spine of any of these books.\nIn fairness, this might be due to the infrequency that I use the tube. As long\nas my bike keeps running, I\u2019m just not\nexposed to the next must-read book.\nIn other areas, I\u2019m a big fan of\nJames Blunt. Though he tends to be a\nbit on the whiny side, his third album\nwas balanced with much more upbeat\nsongs. I also liked Indiana Jones and\nthe Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (and\nTemple of Doom for that matter). Aliens can\u2019t be beyond the shark for a\nseries that has the Ark of the Covenant\nmelt a man\u2019s face. That film\u2019s problem\nis that it has to compete in such a great\nseries without the benefit of rose-tinted\nspectacles.\nThis misalignment with the mainstream stems from my childhood, I\nthink. I wasn\u2019t that popular in school\nand so I instinctively shunned what I\nthought was popular. I even resisted\nPok\u00e9mon for a good while but there\nis only so long you can put off becoming a Pok\u00e9-mon master. I like to\nthink I\u2019ve overcome this proto-hipster\ncounter-cultural reflex, but even now\nthe fact that something is being read\nor watched by everyone is unlikely to\nendear it de facto to me.\nThis does tend to isolate me somewhat in social situations \u2013 it\u2019s a position I\u2019m more than used to. It means\nI\u2019m limited to the most rudimentary of\nquestions when my topic of specialist\nignorance comes up at parties. More\noften than not, I excuse myself to the\nkitchen and try to do some washing up\nfor want of anything better to do. However, the reverse is far more interesting.\nIf the discourse turns to my interests I\nhave to argue harder, with far greater\npassion, in order to engender curiosity\nin my audience. I\u2019m proselytising, I\nknow that, but I want people to like the\nthings I like. As I said, I\u2019m no hipster.\nGiven the sheer volume of must-read\nbooks and must-watch TV out there,\nit\u2019s near-impossible to keep your head\nabove the waters of the mainstream.\nBy the time you\u2019ve finished the trilogy or the box-set, everyone else has\nmoved on and is talking about the next\nbig thing.\nIn contrast, my stream may be smaller but it has a much gentler current. In\nit, I can paddle at my own pace. And I\nrepeat, I am not a hipster.\nThis misalignment\nwith the\nmainstream\nstems from my\nchildhood... I even\nresisted Pokemon\nfor a good while\nThis mis\nThis mis\nwith the\nwith the\n\u201d\nkemon\nkemon\nwhile\nwhile\nRhys Davies\nWell fucking Mexico yeah. That\u2019s a Nathan Barley reference, you\u2019ve probably\nnever heard of it\nCat got your tongue?\nI set the smoke alarm off\nin the library. I ain\u2019t even\nbeen revising. Damn, exams\nshould be illegal not this.\nThe big Snoop Dizzle\u2019s\ngonna write about\nthis and send it in\nto the Commentizzle\nsectizzle.\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\no\no\no\no\nom\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nmm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\nm\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 11 MAY 2012 23\nrs of film production\nnger the usual globe nor the mountain covered in snow, both companies are proudly showing off their 100-hem, Felix Film looks back at the studios\u2019 biggest financial hits. Here\u2019s to 100 more glorious years!\n1. Titanic\nThanks to the most recent 3D conversion re-release of James Cameron\u2019s juggernaut, Titanic has sailed past the 2 billion-dollar mark in-ternationally. It held the record for highest grossing film of all time until\nCameron beat his own record with Avatar. 15 years on, the romance\nbetween Jack and Rose shows no sign of cooling down, as audiences\nworldwide still flock to the cinema to watch the doomed lovers sink.\n2. The Ten Commandments\nCecile B. DeMille\u2019s almost four-hour long biblical epic requires a heck\nof a lot of patience, tasty snacks and intermittent loo breaks to sit\nthrough. It might even be faster to scan through the Book of Exodus\n(on which this is based) instead. But this mother of all epics puts even\nCleopatra to shame; DeMille spends as much time on focusing on the\nlavish scale of his production as he does on his leads.\n3. Raiders of the Lost Ark\nSteven Spielberg wasn\u2019t only making colossal financial hits with Universal \u2013 his Indiana Jones films were backed by Paramount who made\nan absolute fortune out of the series. Harrison Ford was a hit with\nboth the ladies (with his looks) and gentlemen (this time, more with his\nheroic status), with the ever-so brilliant Spielberg further cementing his\nstatus as one of the big players in Hollywood.\n4. The Godfather\nIt certainly would have been odd if \u201cThe Greatest Film Ever Made\u201d\ndidn\u2019t make the list of the highest grossing films of all time. Considered\nby many critics and fans to be the quintessential movie that is the representation of perfect filmmaking in every sense, you have to see it to\nbelieve just how good this is. The sequels are just as good, but nothing\ntops the original... oh, and that infamous horse\u2019s head.\n5. Forrest Gump\nPulp Fiction fans, look away. The very film that stole the Best Picture\nOscar in 1995 from Quentin Tarantino\u2019s beloved crime thriller takes the\nnumber five slot on Paramount\u2019s biggest money-makers. Tom Hanks,\none of the most likable faces around Hollywood, plays a character everyone loves to treasure, living out a narrative that is as sugar-coated\nand sweet as a box of chocolates.\n6. Grease\n\u2018We Go Together,\u2019 \u2018Summer Nights,\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re the One That I Want,\u2019 are\nonly a select few of what the musical phenomenon Grease brought\nalong with it. John Travolta is both hunky and smooth as he dances\naway at a car wash, whereas Olivia Newton-John is the sweet and innocent darling waltzing around in her skirt until her hysterical last-minute\nmakeover. The less that is said about the sequel though, the better.\n7. Love Story\n\u201cLove means never having to say you\u2019re sorry\u201d...either the most romantic thing you can hear someone say, or a vomit-inducing, corny cheese-fest. Whatever you take away from the line, we\u2019ll agree with you, since\nLove Story is a truly acquired taste of a film. It\u2019s manipulation after\nmanipulation, but the impossibly good-looking charms of Ryan O\u2019Neal\nand Ali MacGraw may be hard to resist.\n8. Beverly Hills Cop\nOnce upon a time, you might be surprised to hear that Eddie Murphy was once considered a serious, profitable movie star. A lot has\nchanged in thirty years, but it doesn\u2019t alter the fact that Murphy\u2019s hit\ncop comedy spent the 2nd most non-consecutive weeks (28) at the\nnumber one spot in the U.S. box office, outdone only by Titanic. Whatever happened to him is anyone\u2019s guess.\n9. The Greatest Show on Earth\nThe second Cecile B. DeMille feature to nab a spot on this list, this\nvisually dazzling feature full of actual circus acts, never-before-seen\nscale and the unforgettable James Stewart cameo as Buttons the\nClown, walked away with the Best Picture Oscar in 1953. Again, the\nfilm has a considerable running time, but you\u2019ll barely notice with all\nthe extravagant set pieces.\n10. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\nEver the master in directing sequels that are as financially successful as its predecessor, Spielberg makes another entry to this top 10\nlist with Temple of Doom, a direct follow-up to Raiders of the Lost Ark.\nThe critical reception wasn\u2019t as warm, with dislikers complaining of the\nfilm\u2019s vulgarity and senseless darker turn, but it would appear the audience loved it just the same.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX Friday 11 MAY 2012 9\nW\nell, how do I start\noff? Let me just begin by saying that\nI was diagnosed\nof having severe\ndepression and have been meeting my\ndoctor and I am currently on medication\nsince the last academic year. I\u2019ve been\nthrough the whole process of counsel-ling, psychiatric evaluation, CBT sessions (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy),\nand there have even been times that I\u2019ve\nrung up the Samaritans when it was just\ntoo much for me to handle. So, yes, I\u2019ve\nhad and still having my share of mental\nhealth issues.\nHow did it start? Not exactly sure\nhow it all began! But when I was a pre-adolescent I remember being really irritated and just wanted to get out of my\nown skin. I would start scratching myself vigorously, and flapping my hands\naround and always had that feeling of\npunching something (don\u2019t worry, I\ndon\u2019t randomly just punch people!). By\nthis time I\u2019ve changed countries, went\nto school in a totally new place and everything was just new! My family was\nbroken up and life just started getting\na bit hectic for my taste. Then comes\nalong puberty and the whole teenage\ndrama begins! I was bullied in school\nboth verbally and physically. Wasn\u2019t\nreally sure why I was bullied and the\nmore I thought of it the more confused\nI got and the more depressed I started to\nget. To add to that, I only got to see my\ndad once a year and when I do see him,\nhe always buggered off somewhere and\nwhen he was around it just felt like, that\nhe didn\u2019t really seem to care about us.\nThings got worse to a point that suicide\nseemed to be the only solution! Which\nI did proceed with, but luckily stopped\nmyself from over dosing before it was\ntoo late! This was at the age of 13. That\nwas my first major episode.\nThroughout the years the episodes\ngot worse. When I mean episodes, I\nmean periods of me being depressed\nfor more than a month. During these\nperiods I was insomniac or slept a lot,\nstarved myself, had thoughts of hurting\nmyself or even suicide, was lethargic,\ncouldn\u2019t concentrate, was panicking a\nlot, was crying my eyes off every day,\nwas having different body ailments and\nthe list goes on and on\u2026 The worst part\nis I hated myself, I wasn\u2019t comfortable\nbeing in my own skin and there was always that thought where I just wanted\nto rip my skin apart and run away from\nall the trauma. Every day before I went\nto bed I prayed that I wouldn\u2019t wake\nup the next morning and when I did\nwake up it was just a horrendous feel-ing. I couldn\u2019t tell anyone how I felt\nUnseen Imperial\nbecause for one I didn\u2019t want to accept\nthat something was wrong with me and\ntwo, people would just call me a retard\nor say deal with it or man up or something stupid like that. I tried comforting\nmyself by talking to my toys and doing\na whole psychiatric session by myself\n(yes, I had toys, I was 15). I was never a\nsocial outcast, I had a lot of friends and\nI was quite active during school time. It\nwas all just an act! People thought I was\nhappy and never assumed that anything\nwas wrong, but boy were they wrong as\nhell.\nSo, before coming to Imperial I had\nabout four or five major episodes and a\nhuge amount of minor episodes. I never\npaid close attention to my episodes.\nYes, I had all my depressive symptoms\nand I did weird stuff to take care of it,\nbut I never told anyone anything. I was\nfaking my way through and didn\u2019t want\nto accept the fact that there might be\nsomething wrong with me.\nI got chosen to Imperial and everything was going quite alright. The stress\nof work did get to me and I did have my\nspirals, but everything went fine. Even\nhad a mini break down during the exam\ntime period but ended up doing pretty\nwell.\nThen it was the next academic year\nand all hell just got loose. The thing is\nwith my episodes (should be like everyone else\u2019s), the more I ignored it and\nthe more I didn\u2019t get help the worse it\ngot. During the first term of my second\nyear it got really bad! The trauma, the\nagony, the pain I went through was just\nexcruciating. For someone who hasn\u2019t\ngone through any sort of mental health\nissue this might sound like an exaggera-tion, but trust me when I say that the\npain you go through is agonising and\nis actually hard to describe in words.\nThere were times that I actually was\nparalysed. I couldn\u2019t move, if I were\nstanding, I\u2019d collapse to the floor and\nmy whole body would just go numb.\nHurting myself and suicide became priority in my head. I would hurt myself\nwhen I was at lectures using a pen, at\nhome it\u2019d be a sharp object. I kept banging my head hard against a wall. I kept\non pulling my hair out (literally). I tried\nto keep myself happy, tried hanging out\nwith people, watched movies, cooked,\nate what I liked, but it didn\u2019t make me\nfeel better, it just made me feel worse. I\ndidn\u2019t want to hang out with my friends\nbecause I thought they\u2019d see right\nthrough me and they would consider\nme to be some sort of omen. I walked\nwhenever I started getting depressed\nand sometimes I\u2019d walk for hours at\ntwo in the morning. I just wanted to run\naway. I despised myself and seeing myself in the mirror just made me want to\npull my eyes out. I was always crying\nand wanted to be alone. I couldn\u2019t focus\nat all and there were times I had to just\nstand up and get out of the lecture room\nbecause I was feeling really uncomfort-able. The list does go on and some of\nthem are pretty gruesome, but that is\nthe sad truth about mental health issues\nwhen they are untreated.\nThen during the second term I just\ncouldn\u2019t handle it anymore and took\nthe leap of making an appointment\nwith the Imperial College Counselling\nService! The day of the first appointment came along and I was having regrets and jitters. As once as I go in, the\ncounsellor just asked a few questions. I\njust couldn\u2019t hold it in and started crying like I\u2019ve never cried before. The\ncounsellor was very understanding\nand made me feel like someone actually cared (I know it\u2019s their job, but\nsometimes that small gesture means the\nworld to you). He then advised me to go\nto see my doctor which I did and have\nbeen since. I\u2019ve been on medication\nsince then and have seen a psychiatrist\nfor further evaluation of my problem. I\nalso started on my CBT sessions, which\nare really helpful and gives you guidance on how to deal with problems you\nsuffer. I really can\u2019t thank these few\npeople enough for what they\u2019ve helped\nme through with and will always be\ngrateful to them.\nSo if you are suffering or know anyone who is suffering from a mental\nhealth issue, please get help! You might\nthink it is embarrassing, you might\nthink people might take the mock out\nof you, you might feel you are a failure.\nI know I did! But after that first step,\nit becomes a bit easier for you to open\nup and help yourself get through with\nit. I\u2019m not saying it is easy at all, it is\ntough and there are some instances that\nyou\u2019ll have to put that extra effort in!\nBut all I\u2019m saying is that get help if you\nare having some troubles, being quiet\nand feeling ashamed never helps and I\ndon\u2019t want anyone to go through what\nI\u2019ve been through! I\u2019ve been having this\nfor ten years and am still in the process\nof getting help for the past one and a\nhalf years! I don\u2019t want to make this\nsound like a happy ending in a fairy tale\nbut with all the help I\u2019m getting, I find\nmyself to be more confident and happier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life! So,\nplease do get help is you are suffering\nfrom a mental health issue!\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to accept that something\nwas wrong with me\u201d\nI\nn 2011 the world that I loved\nturned dim. It\u2019s hard to describe\nhow things turned so quickly, but\nthey did. There were redundancies and many uncertainties. My\nfriends were receiving letters to say they\nwere to be made redundant and the supervisors had gone underground. We did\nnot know what was going on and people\nbecame worried and upset. I was the only\none about to ask and question. It was\nhard seeing my friends crying and unable\nto contact the supervisors to talk through\nthe situations. I too had been moved to\nwhat we started to call the redundancy\nwaiting room \u2013 as all those who were\nmoved were being made redundant.\nI continued my work and developing\nmy research program. There was little\nfeedback on my work and my questions\nabout what was going on went unan-swered. Instead of meeting to discuss my\nwork, I would receive an occasional short\ncurt email. It just made me worry more.\nThat I guess was the start of the spiral.\nMy health spiralled very quickly into a\nvery dim depressive place. I took advice\nfrom a friend and went to my GP \u2013 who\ndiagnosed clinical depression. I was put\non an antidepressant and psychology\nsessions were set up, I felt relieved that\nthings were going to be ok.\nI contacted my supervisors and told\nthem that I had been to my GP and was\ndiagnosed with clinical depression. I\nguess I expected that they would be understanding and supportive. No, they\njust demanded that I report back and\nstart work the following Monday. Then\nthey stopped talking to me, advised my\ncollaborators to stop talking to me and\nstopped my salary. What they did made\nmy recovery very hard. Not only did I\nhave to try and get well from a very serious condition, but I had to try and fight\nfor what were basic human rights in the\nUK.\nIt all just made me so very sad. Sad\nthat people I had known and worked with\nfor many years would be so unsupport-ive, when I most needed to be supported.\nIf there is one message I would like to\ntransmit to all, it is keep communication\nopen when working with someone who\nhas clinical depression. Support them in\nthe same you would support someone\nwho told you they had just been diagnosed with cancer. One in four people in\nthe UK will experience a mental health\nproblem in any given year. There is no\nexcuse for ignorance.\nIf you\u2019d like to share your experiences of anything people don\u2019t openly\ndiscuss, such as faith, sexuality,\nbody image, mental health, disability or discrimination of any kind,\nplease email icu-disabilities@impe-rial.ac.uk.

    "content": "The horror of the modern\nday horror\nRegular readers might know I\u2019ve covered a few\nhorror games in my time \u2013 Amnesia: The Dark\nDescent, Dead Rising 2, Dead Space 2, Limbo,\nand how could I fail to mention Baron Wittard:\nNemesis of Ragnarok (a game as scary as a furious kitten). I\u2019ve also played a good few games\nI haven\u2019t written about. Why am I telling you\nthis? Beyond proving I have no social life, I\nalso hope to demonstrate that I\u2019m rather partial towards horror games. They offer a unique\ngaming experience \u2013 when done well.\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s my eternal gripe. As\nit is, horror has mostly lost its edge when it\ncomes to video games. Whilst what scares\npeople differs from person to person there are\na few aspects that are vitally important when\nyou set out to create a game intending to nudge\npeople onto the edge of their seats. These are\njust a few.\nTone\nFirst, a game has to decide upon its tone before\ngoing any further. Is it going to be a scary hor-ror, designed to creep you out? A light hearted\nhorror, where the horror serves merely as a\nminor backdrop? Games such as Amnesia or\nDead Rising 2 have nailed this \u2013 they know\nwhat they want to be. Amnesia deliberately sets\nout to scare you and does so with great aplomb.\nLikewise, Dead Rising 2 wants you to have\nmindless fun, and the ensuing goofy, off\nthe wall gameplay with zombies thrown\nin does not disappoint. There is nothing\nwrong with games like Dead Rising 2\nor Left 4 Dead, because you know\nfrom the advertising what you\u2019re\ngetting.\nNo so with games such as\nDoom 3 or Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil. Such\ngames are set out as\nhorrors, when in reality\nthey\u2019re better suited as\naction shooters. The Doom\nseries up until 3 got this\n\u2014 demons were just a\nhandy enemy to mas-sacre. Attempts\nto make Doom\noverly scary\nhave created\na game that\u2019s\nneither here\nnor there. It\u2019s\na competent\ns h o o t e r ,\nbut lots of\nd a r k n e s s\ndoes not\na horror game\nmake.\ni saw her standing there\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/593631\nFrom silly zombies we get to a silly dog somehow capable of contorting its body with complete disregard\nfor its internal organs. If this wasn\u2019t a flash game the\nRSPCA would have a field day.\nTwist, turn and guide your way through a series\nof lasers, floating mines and block switches to collect a bunch of jewels for no adequately explained\nreason other than that it\u2019s fun. Some randomly moving mines may frustrate slightly, but otherwise Silly\nSausage provides hours of fun (along with a mildly\nhumourous title).\nYou can\u2019t control who you fall in love with, any more\nthan you can control the tides or the rise and fall of\nthe Sun. Romance between a man and his zombi-fied lover must never, therefore, be looked down\nupon.\ni saw her standing there is a cutesy little game\ninvolving a (somewhat deluded) man guiding his\nzombified heart throb to a protective cage. In the\nway stand an army of envious zombie Lotharios.\nWill you win her heart? Will she win your brains?\nOnly one way to find out...\nFELIX\nFriday 11 may 2012\n26\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\nGAMES\nFree Web Games\nMore exams? If you care about what sort of\ngrades you\u2019ll get it\u2019s probably best you don\u2019t read\non any further my friends, because here I present\nto you two totally awesome web games that you\ncan play right now in your web browser. In order to\nplay these you\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash\nPlayer plug-in, which can be installed from http://\nget.adobe.com/flashplayer/\nSilly Sausage\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/594013\nMonsters\nMonsters are right at home in horror \u2013 but not all\nmonsters are effective. A good horror should use\nthem sparingly. The human imagination is a wild\nand vivid thing, and letting people imagine what\nliesinadarkenedroomfilledwithheavy,laboured\nbreathingisfarmoreeffectivethanshowingthem.\nWhat is deemed visually scary by one person\nmay not to someone else, and vice versa. What\nsounds scary tends to be more common \u2013 think\nmewling kittens versus snarling, disembodied\ngurgling. Some of the scariest moments in\nDoom 3 simply involved noises in air vents and\ncorpses being dragged away by an unseen entity.\nWhen a monster is seen, it obviously has\nto look scary. Now this, as I\u2019ve said, is\na very subjective point. However, one\nconcept in 3D design tends to be well\naccepted, that of the uncanny valley,\na hypothesis in 3D computer\nanimation that states that\nas a human replica\nbecomes more and\nmore human it\nwill reach a point at\nwhich it looks and\nacts almost\nhuman. This\nis the point\nrevulsion\nkicks in.\nMonsters\nthat look\nhuman or,\ne v e n\nbetter, ones that look like they could have been\nhumans work well, such as the nurses and\nPyramid Head from Silent Hill (pictured). On\nan unconscious level the brain creeps out, but\nyou can\u2019t quite work out why. This is at least\na redeeming factor in Dead Space \u2013 whilst the\nmonsters may jump out at you all the time,\nyou can clearly see they\u2019re horrifically mutated\nhumans,andthat\u2018creep\u2019factorwormsitswayinto\nyour brain. Talking of jumping out all the time...\nPacing and Tension\nEveryone ought to be familiar with the concept\nof tension \u2013 after all, it is exam season \u2013 but\npacing is less well understood. Pacing is how\nthe highs and the lows of the game mix together,\nand is better described with examples.\nIn Dead Space enemies attack you all the time\nwith little let-up. You are constantly attacking,\nand because of this a) you end up mentally\nexhausted, b) there\u2019s no tension because you\nknow something is going to jump out soon, and\nc) the monsters fail to have that same scare fac-tor. Constant action in a game where you can\u2019t\njust run \u2018n\u2019 gun makes for a negatively draining\nexperience.\nOn the other hand Amnesia manages pacing\nwell. A main annex in each level is safe, but\neverywhere you branch off to isn\u2019t. When you\nreach one of these annex\u2019s calming music plays,\nsignifying a break in the action, allowing you to\ncompose yourself before starting up again. It\u2019s a\npalette cleanser, and serves to keep the\ngame constantly scary by preventing\nthe tension from overwhelming you.\nIs it unfair to compare these two radically different games, each with\ndifferent developers and goals?\nPerhaps. But ultimately both\ngames set out to scare, and in\nthe end only one succeeds. A\nlarge part of this is simply\ndown to how the action is\nspaced out. Pacing cannot be ignored.\nMaking good horror is a lot more complex than what I\u2019ve\nglanced over here, and\nmy displeasure when\nit comes to modern\nhorror games has only\njust begun to break free\nonto paper. Despite everything though, I have\nnothing against any of the\naforementioned games \u2014\nthey are all at least com-petent. They\u2019re just\nnot scary when they\npromised they would\nbe. To quote something I wrote in\nmy first Felix article \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s [modern horror] fun,\nbut it\u2019s like ordering a banana split and receiving a fillet steak \u2013 I like fillet steak, and I\u2019ll eat\nit, but I would have much preferred my banana-based dessert.\u201d\n\u201cLetting people imagine\nwhat lies in a darkened\nroom filled with heavy,\nlaboured breathing is\nfar more effective than\nshowing them.\u201d\nLaurence Pope\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX Friday 11 may 2012 5\nSuper mutant algae declared winner\nTeams from Imperial take runner-up places in BP Ultimate Field Trip\nTwo teams from Imperial reached the\nFinal of BP\u2019s Ultimate Field Trip com-petition, which was held on Tuesday 8\nMay. The prize of a six week internship\nat BP Trinidad & Tobago was ultimately\nwon by a team from the University of\nStrathclyde.\nTasked with outlining how they\nwould make a BP refinery CO2\nneutral\nby 2030, the competition was judged\nnot just on technical content but also\npresentation skills and teamwork. The\nteams, having already presented their\nproposal during the semi-finals, had the\nchance to present their ideas in a succinct manner to staff from BP as well\nas field a 20 minute Q&A session from\nthe likes of BP\u2019s Chief Scientist Ellen\nWilliams at the Royal Institution-based\nfinal.\nThe competition was closely fought\nwith each of the three finalists having\nan advocate on the judging panel. When\nthe audience voted on a separate poster\ncompetition, the voting was just as tight,\nwith a split of 34%Aspire (Strathclyde),\n33% C-less (Imperial) and 31% G.I.C.\n(Imperial).\nTeam Aspire\u2019s proposal was based\non the use of Algae-based bioreactors\nhoused in Lego-brick inspired green\nhouses to break down the CO2\n, with the\nside benefit of the algae by-products being of high value in the nutrition industry (e.g. Omega 3 oils). This proposal\nwas so radically outside of the team\u2019s\nbackground of marine, ocean and aero-mechanical engineering that \u201cit was like\ndoing a whole other degree\u201d, despite\nnot having had to \u201ctake any algae to the\nlab\u201d. There was concerns raised over\nwhether the super mutant algae posed\na threat to wildlife but Aspire defended\ntheir proposal: \u201cit\u2019s alright as it\u2019s a naturally occurring mutant.\u201d\nG.I.C. (Global Intelligence Consulting) outlined a three-phase approach\nwith membrane technology (based on\nresearch being carried out at Imperial)\nbeing the first part of their proposal,\nwhich culminated in artificial-leaf CO2\nbreak down. G.I.C. stressed the importance that \u201cyou won\u2019t go to bed and\nwake up the next morning with a carbon\nneutral refinery\u201d and that a flexible solution with immediate action is necessary.\nC-Less outlined an efficiency improvement approach with large amounts\nof retro fitting to existing refineries to\ncut CO2\nemission before finally using\ncarbon capture and storage to remove\nthe CO2\nunder the North Sea. Whilst\nretro fitting is not cheap, \u201clooking at the\ncosts makes me wince,\u201d a BP employee\ncommented. The retrofitting also has\nthe advantage of being a partial solution that can be enacted right now rather\nthan waiting for technology to develop.\nDespite not winning the competition\nboth teams from Imperial said that it\nwas the chance to put their knowledge\ninto practice and to try and tackle a\nlarge-scale problem that was the real\nreason they entered the competition.\n\u201cWe often get stuck working on prob-lems, we lose sight of the bigger picture,\u201d student Nicholas Kwok said.\nAs the winning Team Aspire will be\nspending six weeks as guests of BP\nTrinidad & Tobago and will visit BP\u2019s\noperations in the Gulf of Mexico, alongside spending time in New Orleans.\nLast year\u2019s winners said that whilst\nthey were envious of this year\u2019s prize\n(\u201cWe should have a waited a year\u201d) as it\ngives Apsire the chance to see BP working on another continent, they were\nhappy not to have to try and tackle this\nyear\u2019s challenge. Despite the challenge\nof making a refinery CO2\nfree by 2030,\nBP Chief Scientist Ellen Williams said\n\u201cif we had the solution we could do it \u2013\nand that\u2019s the kicker\u201d.\nBoth Ellen Williams and David Eyton,\nGroup Head of Technology, were both\nkeen to point out that this competition\nwas more about challenging students\nthan getting research done for free: \u201cBP\nhas looked at all of these ideas\u201d. With\nthe success of the competition over the\nlast three years, next year the competition will be international, meaning that\nstudents from Imperial will have even\nmore competition next year if they want\nto win the \u201cUltimate Field Trip\u201d.\n\u201c[the competition]\nwas like doing a\nwhole other degree\u201d\n\u201cif we had the solution we could do it \u2013\nand that\u2019s the kicker\u201d\nJonathan Peek\nThe Final was held at the Royal Institution\nMore tension than 45 minutes of Deal or No Deal\nFrom left to right: Zhen Xiong, Dun Xiang, and Nicholas Kwok of Global Intelligence Consulting, Zie Wearn\nChua, Wern Chia Chang, and Zhi Xiong Chong of C-Less, Edward Kay, Simonas Stilius, and Guy Drori of Aspire\nZhen Xiong explains it all Aspire (far right) won over the judges with their algae concept\n\n"

    "content": "Stars approaching a supermassive black hole\nare ripped apart by its huge tidal force. The\nblack hole gobbles part of star and spits out\nsome material in form of radiation. This fantastic phenomenon has been observed by a team of\nastrophysicists from US and UK through observations obtained from the telescope in Mount\nHaleakala, Hawaii, and the Chandra X-Ray\nSpace Observatory.\nFrom a survey of thousands of galaxies, the\nscientists found that both the telescope and the\nGalaxy Evolution Explorer satellite had detected a luminous flare from the centre of a galaxy\nlocated at a distance of approximately 2 billion\nlight-years from the Earth. The flare, dubbed\nPS1-10jh, is extremely intense and reveals an\nuncommon shape of the light-curve. The long\nduration of the phenomenon (a few months) was\nnot typical of gamma ray bursts that fade away\nwithin a day and come from the explosion of\nmassive stars or collisions between giant stars.\nStars-shredding events are rare and occur\nroughly every 10,000 years in a galaxy. One can\nbe detected from Earth once every two years. In\nJune 2011 astronomers from the University of\nBerkely, California, had observed a similar phenomenon coming from a galaxy as far as four\nmillions light-years from Earth.\nHowever, the present study published in Nature, is the first to give accurate predictions.\nAnalysing the intensity of the radiation of the\nlight flare and the shape of the curves and fitting\nthe data to numerical simulations the scientists\ncalculated a mass of the black hole as big as\nabout that of 3 million suns and reconstructed\nthe orbit of the star finding it to be tight to the\nBlack hole shreds star\nblack hole. They also estimated the event occurred for about 76 days.\nThe most intriguing aspect of the discovery is the prediction of the structure of the\nstar. Analysis of the spectra of the radiation\nrevealed that the disrupted star was a red giant with a helium-rich core whose hydrogen\nshell was previously stripped off. Gezari, the\nleader author of the study from Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, Maryland, says that this \u201cis a consequence of being in the environment of the\nblack hole.\u201d\nSome questions such as the low temperature\nof the radiation and the lack of effects from\ngeneral relativity in the model remain open,\nbut the possibility of characterising the light\nfrom black holes can give precious information\nabout their gravitational field.\nDOI:10.1038/nature10990\nResearchers in New York have engineered a\nway to non-invasively trigger gene activation\nin live animals using nanoparticles and radio\nwaves, a method that may, in the future, be\nused to remotely control genes in humans for\nmedical purposes.\nCurrent methods of activating cells are unwieldy at best: direct stimulation using electrodes is invasive, potentially damaging and\nnon-specific, whilst control of individual light-activated channels using different wavelengths\nof precisely-timed light pulses requires internally implanted light pipes. But, by abusing the\nproperties of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeNPs)\nand temperature-sensitive ion channels, the researchers found a way to finely control certain\ngenes non-invasively.\nJeffery Friedman and colleagues of The\nRockefeller University targeted FeNPs to a\nmodified, temperature-sensitive cation chan-nel, TRPV1 (otherwise known as the capsaicin receptor) by coating the nanoparticles\nwith antibodies specific to a modified tag on\nthe channel. Exposure to low- and mid-range\nradio wave frequencies heated up the targeted\nnanoparticles but not the surrounding tissue,\nthereby activating the channel upon reaching\nits activation temperature. The resulting calcium ion influx activated a specially modified\ngene that controlled expression of insulin.\nThis lead to a corresponding drop in blood\nglucose levels after 30 minutes.\nThe team also experimented with nanoparticles that could be made intracellularly using\nmodified ferritin, a naturally occurring iron-storage protein. They saw that insulin secretion still occurred, albeit more weakly.\nRadio wave gene activation has the advantage of being both non-damaging to tissue and\nnon-invasive whilst heating surrounding cells\nto a minimal degree. Currently however the\ntechnique can only be used in basic animal re-search, as the delivery of nanoparticles into a\nliving organism requires the deliberate growth\nof tumours, making it inappropriate for use in\nhuman clinical research.\nFriedman hopes though that as research progresses use of nanoparticles in a therapeutic\nsetting will be able to treat diseases involving\nprotein deficiencies, such as hexosaminidase\nA replacement in Tay-Sachs disease.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1216753\nLaurence Pope\nFELIX\nFriday 11 may 2012\n12\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nWhat we missed...\nAntonio Torrisi\nResearchers from the University of Washington\nhave used techniques from quantum physics and\nneuroscience to control brain cells for the first\ntime. Photosensitive semiconducting nanoparticles known as quantum dots have been used to\nstimulate the brain, and it is believed these techniques could pave the way to non-invasive treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\ndepression and epilepsy.\nWhile the experiment was conducted on a film\nexternal to the body, the team claims for humans,\nthe quantum dots would need to be delivered to\nbrain tissue. Lih Lin, the researcher who headed\nup the team, said that \u201ca significant advantage is\nthat [the quantum dots\u2019] surface can be modified\nwith various molecules\u201d and used to target specific brain cells.

In an\nAdventure with\nScientists!\nBye, bye Miss American Pie\nMy girlfriend sometimes says that I\u2019m\njust a big kid sometimes. That doesn\u2019t\nbother me \u2013 kids get all the really cool\nstuff. After going to see this film, that\nopinion is now firmly cemented in her\nmind.\nFrom the studio that brought us Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run, Pirates! revolves around the exploits of a\nrather amusing crew of pirates, headed\nby the Pirate Captain (voiced by Grant).\nThe plot sees the pirates, accompanied\nby a young Charles Darwin (voiced by\nDavid Tennant) head to London to exhibit Polly, a dodo, to the Royal Society. The Pirate Captain hopes that the\nenormous cash prize will secure his bid\nfor the Pirate of the Year award.\nThere is nothing original about the\nstory. It\u2019s an old one, a common one,\nand there isn\u2019t much in the way of plot\ntwists, none that couldn\u2019t be guessed\nahead of time anyway. However, this\nfilm succeeds in telling it in a charming and amusing fashion. The writing\nis filled with jokes and humour, and a\nsurprising amount of innuendo for a\nchildren\u2019s film. It also helps that the\nstop-motion characters are just so lively and fun to watch.\nIn addition to Grant and Tennant, the\ncast is filled with a host of British tal-ent. Martin Freeman, Brendan Gleeson\nand Russell Tovey all take their place\namong the Pirate Captain\u2019s most motley crew, Imelda Staunton plays an imperious and pirate-hating Queen Victoria, and Brian Blessed even makes an\nappearance as the King of the Pirates.\nFew films can boast of such a rosta and\nthis one keenly avoid the mistake to\ncram them all onscreen. Each character\nis given their proper time.\nThe film is punctuated at times by\nmodern music such as \u2018London\u2019s Calling\u2019 by The Clash and \u2018I\u2019m Not Crying\u2019 by Flight of the Conchords, usually during a montage scene. While\nalways apt for the onscreen action, it\ndid jar me a little from the 1830s.\nThis film is aimed at children but\nthe humour was just as funny for (so-called) adults like myself. Children\u2019s\nmovies can run the risk of patronising\ntheir audience (and losing the interest of both adults and children). This\nfilm avoids that. The jokes are funny\nregardless of whether you\u2019re eight or\neighty. Indeed, several jokes revolve\naround the Pirate Captain inadvertently hinting at evolution to young Darwin, accessible only to those aware of\nhis contribution to science.\nIn short, this is the perfect film for\nthe Easter Holidays. Children will enjoy it, adults won\u2019t mind going along\nwith them, and students can sneak in\nand pretend they\u2019re with their cousin or\nsomething. It\u2019s not a particularly innovative or imaginative story but it is told\nin a fresh, entertaining way. Go and see\nit if your girlfriend worries that you\u2019re\na little too mature for your age.\nJohn Park\nDirectors Chris Kentis, Laura Lau\nScreenwriter Laura Lau\nCast Elizabeth Olsen, Adam Trese,\nEric Sheffer Stevens\nSilent House\nWho\u2019s that knocking\non my door?\nHere is a film that is more likely to impress than scare. Depending on what\nyou\u2019re in the mood for, Silent House\ncould be the film for you. It would be\nbest not to expect many jump scares\nor any blood, gore and guts. Instead\nbe amazed at how this feature film\nlooks as though it was filmed in one\nlong take, without ever making a scene\nchange. There are some black-outs\nsure, and the number of continuity\nerrors is somewhat laughable, but it\u2019s\nthe real-time, real-life experience that\ncounts. Of course, this was not shot\nin one long take. But the director tries\nvery hard to keep everything flowing.\nFilm-buffs or any eagle-eyed members\nof the audience will be able to spot\nwhere the edits took place, but why try\nto dissect and trivialise what actually\nlooks quite remarkable?\nLike any haunted house horror, the\nfilm opens with an abandoned, worn-down house that is anything but silent.\nA place you wouldn\u2019t want to live in,\nessentially. The walls have holes in\nthem, windows have been bolted shut,\nthere is very little light, the phone line\nis not connected, there is a strange\nneighbour kid, the floors creak, the\ndoors squeak, and so on. Unknowingly\nentering this house are Sarah (Olsen)\nand her family who are getting ready to\nmove out of their lakeside retreat. With\nher father (Trese) and uncle (Stevens),\nthey are there to pack things up, fix a\nfew dodgy places, so the new owners\ncan move in.\nAs the work begins, she starts hearing odd noises. Sometimes they\u2019re\nnothing, but soon they develop into\nmore menacing, demanding knocks\nand thumps. Upstairs, outside, downstairs in the cellar, everywhere she\ngoes, these sounds start haunting her.\nHer father, like all men do in horror\nfilms, assures here that it\u2019s an empty\nhouse and that she\u2019s being paranoid.\nBut this doesn\u2019t put her mind at east,\nand soon, even her father seems to vanish into thin air.\nWhat\u2019s disappointing is how, aside\nfrom the filming technique, everything\nis so ordinary and predictable. She\ntakes out a kitchen knife. She loses it.\nShe hides under the dining room table.\nShe feels someone grab her leg from\nbehind. She is found. She tries to get\nout of the house. Oh no, the windows\nhave been bolted shut remember? What\nabout the front door? Darn it, she\u2019s lost\nthe key. The back door? Nope, it\u2019s padlocked shut. She runs upstairs. Hides\nagain. Guess what, found again! It\u2019s a\ntiresome repetition that was never truly\nscary in the first place.\nBut what the seemingly one long\ntake does add to the atmosphere is its\nundeniably claustrophobic set and with\nso many shaky close-ups of Olsen, the\nintensity escalates as when things get\ngoing, the audience isn\u2019t given a single\nsecond to have a breather. The air feels\ntight, and because the 88-minute running time is the exact same time period she experiences in the film, you\nknow she can\u2019t do anything radical or\nunconvincingly heroic. She just doesn\u2019t\nhave the time. And so the anticipation for the ending and answers to our\nburning questions builds up like never\nbefore and the importance of giving a\nreasonable answer becomes ever more\ncrucial.\nUnfortunately, Silent House doesn\u2019t\nget many points on how creative or\nhow big of a shocker the ending is.\nInstead what is commendable is how\nthe final few minutes are shot. Using clever camera tricks and angles, it\ntries its best to explain and tie up the\nloose ends. But unfortunately like most\nhorror films, not every question is an-swered. Given the sustained tension\nin the first half, the pay-off is rather\nbland, and the short length of the film\ncomes to a surprisingly brisk finale.\nAfter the unprecedented success of\nthe Paranormal Activity series, the\nphenomenon of \u201cfound-footage\u201d horror films has, in recent years, become\nan almost annual tradition in which\nhalf-hearted scripts make their way\ninto shaky-cams and are presented to\nsomehow scare someone. Silent House\nrises above the worst of the sub-genre,\nand yet it lacks the truly creepy, horror spectacle. It keeps everything close\nto Olsen\u2019s character, but sometimes it\nfeels too restricted to allow the audience to truly absorb the atmosphere.\nIt\u2019s nice to see a different idea (al-though technically this is a remake of\nan Uruguayan film) not go to waste,\nand it\u2019s certainly not an awful film to\nlist in Olsen\u2019s growing resume.\nJohn Park\nDirectors Jon Hurwitz, Hayden\nSchlossberg\nScreenwriters Jon Hurwitz, Hayden\nSchlossberg\nCast Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan,\nSeann William Scott, Chris Klein,\nThomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid,\nEugene Levy, Jennifer Coolidge\nAmerican Reunion\nMaking that silly face won\u2019t help\nThey\u2019re back! Or more specifically,\nStifler\u2019s (Scott) back! And so is Jim\u2019s\nDad (Levy)! And so is Stifler\u2019s Mom\n(Coolidge)! Do we really care about\nanyone else? A lot of the comedy that\nsticks to our mind revolves around\nthese three characters, and with American Reunion, these three are the ones\nwho once again steal the show, and\nremind us why the American Pie franchise was such a hit.\nWith Reunion the characters have\naged. Their lives have changed and no\nlonger revolve around having to go to\nschool. Instead they have their jobs,\nserious adult relationships, and for\nsome, kids. Jim (Biggs) and Michelle\n(Hannigan) now have a young boy,\nand have very little time to spend for\nthemselves. Oz (Klein) is a sports news\nanchor working in L.A. with a smoking\nhot new girlfriend. Kevin (Nicholas) is\na stay-at-home architect completely devoted to his wife who makes him watch\nthe likes of Gossip Girl and The Bachelorette. And of course, Stifler\u2026 he has\na job. No, really, he does. But it\u2019s clear\nStifler hasn\u2019t grown up one bit, hitting\non women in the workplace with his\nusual, crass practice.\nBringing them all back is the highschool reunion, class of \u201999. And with\nthis, the gang is exactly as you would\nexpect them to be, doing and saying everything that is required of them, and\na lot of the gags work because of the\nfilm\u2019s loyalty to the characters its predecessors have successfully created.\nTheir living situations have changed,\nbut they seem to remain true to them-selves, with actors who look more than\ncomfortable slipping back into the\nroles they originated over 10 years ago.\nThere have been numerous direct-to-video sequels in between the Wedding\nand this Reunion. It\u2019s been a long wait,\nbut it certainly feels nice to have them\nback.\nTrying to squeeze in quieter drama\nin the midst of all the chaos that arises\nfrom the gang\u2019s arrival back in their\nhometown, the film\u2019s frequent missteps originate from trying to attach\ndull life lessons and deeper themes\ninto the many comedic moments. Painfully obvious messages are dragged out\nthrough revelatory conversations characters share in unnecessarily drawn-out scenes that unfortunately contribute\nto the 113-minute running time, plaguing the many crucial moments of the\nfilm\u2019s fast-paced wit with sudden narrative breaks.\nOriginal fans of the series will no\ndoubt welcome back their favourite\ncharacters with open arms, and even\nnewcomers might appreciate the surprisingly accessible, hysterical comedy.\nThere is a chance this could be the last\nouting for Jim and his gang (because\nlet\u2019s face it, what excuse will there be\nnext time to bring everyone back?) and\nthis serves well as the final, send-off\npiece, neatly wrapping everything up to\na sweet and funny conclusion.\n\n"

In order to save you\ntime and limit my own personal biases, I\nwill impartially copy and paste the Wiktionary definition for Santorum:\n\u201cSantorum (noun, uncountable) \u2013 A\nfrothy mixture of lubricant and fecal\nmatter that is an occasional byproduct of\nanal sex. [from 21st c.]\u201d\nOkay maybe it\u2019s not impartial, but it is\nthe Wiktionary definition for Santorum.\nMore specifically, Mr. Santorum was\nthe republican candidate who managed,\nfor the past few months, to continually\nrain on Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential pa-rade. He won a number of primary elections and positioned himself as a serious\ncontender in the 2012 election. Santorum has recently dropped out of the race,\nbut his prolonged viability as a presidential candidate is too curious to ignore.\nHere is a quick fly by of his views.\nDuring a speech on the election trail\nregarding higher education Santorum\naddressed the crowd: \u201cPresident Obama\nsaid he wants everybody in America\nto go to college\u2026 What a snob.\u201d God\nforbid, in an increasingly competitive\nglobal world, that Barack Obama would\nlike the young adults of America to avail\nthemselves of the university system.\nSantorum is against abortion in all\ncases, including rape. His argument?\n\u201cThe right approach,\u201d he said, \u201cis to accept this horribly created, in the sense\nof rape, but nevertheless, a gift\u201d [sic].\nDespite this defense for the sanctity of\nlife, he is still in favour of capital pun-ishment.\nMost controversial are Santorum\u2019s\nviews on homosexuality. He opposes\nopenly gay men and women serving in\nthe military based on what he claims is\nin the best interest of national security.\nSurely if homosexuals were allowed to\nserve openly, American military might\nwould soon be reduced to Elton John\nand pillow fights. He justifies his platform semantically, claiming that military service is not a right, but a privilege\n\u2013 a privilege, of course, to which only us\nheteros are entitled.\nWhen asked to justify his opposition\nto gay marriage, Santorum\u2019s rationale\nwas that no reasonable line could be\ndrawn to limit the inevitable influx of\natypical marriages. \u201cYou can imagine\nall the different types of marriage that\nwould happen,\u201d he said at a town hall\nmeeting. Extending my imagination to\nits limits, I can only come up with a few\nfar-fetched ideas. Santorum on the other\nhand is much more creative about the\n\u201clikely\u201d consequences of relaxed constraints on traditional marriage.\nToward the end of his candidacy Santorum found himself clarifying a statement he made during an interview in\nApril 2003 during which he stated: \u201cIn\nevery society, the definition of marriage\nhas not ever to my knowledge included\nhomosexuality. That\u2019s not to pick on ho-mosexuality. It\u2019s not, you know, man on\nchild, man on dog, or whatever the case\nmay be. It is one thing.\u201d\nPolitical commentators have since cited this sound bite as evidence that Santorum equates homosexuality with bestiality and paedophilia \u2013 an allegation that\nhe forcefully denies, emphasizing that\nhe specifically excluded homosexuality\nfrom those other things.\nNo, he didn\u2019t explicitly equate them.\nBut why was he talking about them\ntogether in the first place? Cognitive\npsychology conceives of the mind as a\nweb of nodes and links. Nodes represent\nobjects or concepts and links represent\nthe strength of the association between\ndifferent nodes. When a given node is\nactivated electronic impulses are triggered that activate other nodes thereby\nleading us to recall certain concepts that\nare, in our minds, associated. For in-stance, when I say renaissance painter\nyou may think of Leonardo da Vinci.\nWhen I say footballer you may think\nof David Beckman. When I say Rick\nSantorum you may think of an unsavory\nfrothy mixture.\nBy distinguishing homosexuality from\nbestiality and pedophilia Santorum manages to give us a sneak peak into how his\nmind actually works. Boiled down and\nbereft of the subtle nuances of language\nSantorum\u2019s queer ideas\nthat he uses for his defense, Santorum\u2019s\nmoral persuasion is clear. To him homo-sexuality, bestiality and pedophilia are\nultimately \u2013 to invoke the misused lingo\nof right-wing fundamentalists \u2013 abomi-nations.\nSantorum is a Catholic fundamental-ist, and his bigoted ideas are based on\nthe teachings of the bible. Today many\nof the faithful take a more flexible interpretation of the holy book, viewing it\nas malleable and understanding that its\nmessage is partly obscured by translation and the passage of more than 2,000\nyears. Sure you can find quaint wisdom\nin the bible, but is it a singularly reliable\nsource for answers to significant moral\nquestions? Is the book that prescribes\ndeath for not observing the Sabbath a\ntenable moral compass for the 21st cen-tury? Why are we seeking answers from\npeople who didn\u2019t have toilet paper?\nVestiges from the past manage to lin-ger. The arguments against The Civil\nRights Act of 1964 weren\u2019t dissimilar to\nthose being levied against the gay-rights\nmovement today. In an interview with\nChris Wallace, Mr. Santorum was asked\nif the following quote dove-tailed with\nhis rationale behind why homosexuals\nshould be excluded from military ser-vice: \u201cThe army is not a sociological\nlaboratory. Experimenting with army\npolicy\u2026 would pose a danger to effi-ciency, discipline and morale and result\nin ultimate defeat.\u201d When Santorum\nagreed that this quote sounded about\nright, Chris Wallace revealed its narra-tor, Colonel Eugene Householder, who\nwas arguing against racial integration in\nthe military.\nIn 2012, what are we doing debating\nthese things? Will our children not look\nback and find these debates as senseless\nand as bigoted as we now perceive those\nregarding racial integration to have\nbeen? What\u2019s does Santorum\u2019s viability\nas a presidential candidate say about our\nsociety?\nEveryone is\nrevising so\ndon\u2019t shout\nit out in the\nlibrary. Your\nother tab is\nFacebook so\nyou may as\nwell just head\non over to:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk to get\nyour voice\nheard.\nJoseph Kaupp\nThis week saw the Postgraduate Graduation Ceremony take place in the Royal Albert Hall. Felix congratulates all of those\nwho received their doctorates and wishes\nyou well for the future of your careers,\nwhether in academia or otherwise.\nThe graduation nevertheless follows the\nnews reported last week that Imperial is\nnow placed joint 71st with Canterbury\nChrist Church University on the Times\nHigher Education Student Experience Survey. This survey follows many others by\ndifferent supplements and publications\nwhich inevitably place Imperial College\nin varying positions on varying topics for\na bevy of different reasons. Regardless,\nthis latest position warranted a discussion of the merits of the system and a\nlook at just what is considered the problem when it comes to student experience\nat Imperial.\nIn the hope of seeing how deep the issue sits with students, this week we put\nout a brief message on the Felix Facebook\npage, asking whether you would consider\nrecommending Imperial to a friend. Of\nthe small handful of respondents, the response was generally muted, though one\nresponse called into question the couple\nof outright \u2018No\u2019 responses as what was\nseen to be a culture of complaint over the\nsame recurring issues and stereotypes.\nWhether the problem is as simple as this\nis another question, however.\nWhile the survey overall had over\n13,000 respondents across universities\nin the United Kingdom, Imperial made up\n156 of those students who took the time\nto respond. This is undeniably a small\nsample of students to draw definitive conclusions about the student experience\nat Imperial. If we really want to judge the\nissue, it is far more worthwhile to take\ninto account other documentation and information such as that generated by the\nNational Student Survey, and the Union\u2019s\nresponse to this.\nPerhaps it is time to stop placing as\nmuch weight as we already do behind\nleague tables. As much a fan as I am of\nthe constant seesaw effect that league\ntables has on a university (with much\npraise from all sides when we\u2019re up, and\ndeep seated contemplation when we\u2019re\ndown), it would be a novel approach to\nback away from worrying about national\ncomparisons and taking a little time to\nengage and progress internally and focus\non the immediate and long term effects.\nAfter all, the over-saturation of constant\ninspection and analysis of universities\nacross the United Kingdom won\u2019t cater to\nImperial\u2019s own specific needs.\nLeague table woes\nnot a problem\nJust be glad we didn\u2019t put a picture of the Wiktionary definition up...\n\n"

The Science Challenge,\nrun annually by Imperial\u2019s Royal College of\nScience Union, invited students from the College, as well as secondary schools around the\ncountry, to answer science based essay questions set by high profile judges. One Imperial\nand one schools winner was chosen from the\nanswers to each question and an overall winning College and schools essay was then chosen from amongst these.\nSecond year undergraduate Eugene Lee was\nthe Imperial winner in the first category, in\nwhich Professor Lord Robert Winston asked\n\u201cWhat are the five main ethical issues that\nface modern science and how do we tackle\nthem?\u201d Lee told Felix that he \u201cchose the ethics question because it was the one closest to\nmy heart; being a biomedical science student\u201d.\nHe got his \u201cinspiration to write about it using\nthe laboratory as a reference starting point\nfor a narrative\u201d. While \u201cit was hard to choose\nonly five of the biggest ethical issues for the\nessay though\u201d since ethics is \u201csomething that\npermeates all corners and areas of science\u201d he\nsays that there was the added benefit that \u201cethics is something that everyone feels strongly\nabout and can relate to easily\u201d which meant\nthat it is a topic he could confidently write\nabout \u201cwithout going into too much technical\ndetail\u201d for a layperson reader.\nMathematic postgraduate Matthew Gipon\u2019s\nwork was judged to be the best Imperial answer to the second question, set by BBC science correspondent and former Felix Editor\nPallab Ghosh \u2013 \u201cWhat is the role of science\njournalism in the 21st Century?\u201d In his essay\nGipon argues that a modern science journalist\nshould not only move beyond \u201cregurgitating\npress releases\u201d but also retain a broad focus\nand consider \u201cthe political, economic and social dimensions\u201d of scientific results.\nCell & Molecular Sciences postgraduate\nChristopher Waite was chosen as the winner in\nthe third category, in which senior Accenture\nexecutive Peter Lacy asked \u201cWhat scientific\nbreakthrough should we focus on to provide\nsustainable food, energy and water for nine\nbillion people on a planet of apparently finite\nnatural resources, and why?\u201d Waite says that\nhis background in biology means that he has\nalways had \u201ca passion for plants so presenting\ntheir case as a solution to the imminent global\nfood and fuel crises was an easy choice for\n[his] answer to the sustainability question\u201d.\nHe chose to write about \u201cgenetic modification\nof the hub for photosynthesis, the chloroplast\u201d\nsince this area has a great deal of potential.\nWaite says that chloroplasts \u201ccan house a\nplethora of bacterial genes with a variety of\nfunctions while allowing some primary risks\nof traditional GM to be circumvented\u201d.\nEngineering postgraduate Carys Cook was\nselected as the overall winner for her answer\nto the question \u201cHow should politicians best\nmake use of science?\u201d set by Times Science\nEditor Mark Henderson. Titled \u201cParliamentary Election Manifesto of a Scientist Turned\nPolitician\u201d her essay outlines how a widespread scientific illiteracy amongst members\nof Parliament has made her decide to turn\nto politics. Cook told Felix that \u201cthe lack of\nscientific literacy in politics explains why\npoliticians dismiss scientific advice about issues incredibly relevant to the public, such as\nclimate change or drug policy\u201d. She believes\nthat \u201cmore scientists should become more actively involved in the political process\u201d and\nthat \u201cimproved understanding of the scientific\nprocess will not only ensure politicians will\nbetter consider scientific information, but will\nmake them more objective and better decision\nmakers\u201d.\nAs overall winner Carys received a cash\nprize of \u00a32,000 and a tour of CERN for herself\nand one guest. The other Imperial winners received a \u00a3500 cash prize each.

Franklin Pugh, Penn State University\nIn March this year the British Science\nAssociation released a survey that indi-cated, at least to some degree, that the\nBritish public is slightly less concerned\nabout the prospect of embracing genetically modified food. This comes in\nstark contrast to the hostility exhibited\ntowards the technology a decade ago,\nwhen it was rejected in an outright fashion in the nationwide surveys dubbed\nGM Nation. This essentially halted the\npush for GM crops by Tony Blair\u2019s government and put research in this area\non the backburner. But GM has now\nfound its way back onto the radar; more\nflexible EU legislation regarding the\ntechnology combined with the survey\nresults means that perhaps the public is\nonce again in the mood for a conversation about the technology.\nAll the interest groups,\nfrom anti-GM campaigners to researchers have\nbeen airing their arguments and framing the debate in a\nvery public fashion\nover the past few\nweeks. When interest\ngroups frame a debate as part\nof their strategy to appeal to the public,\nthey simplify the issues, lending more\nweight to certain aspects over others.\nSo how is the GM debate being framed\nby the two main two opposing groups?\nAnti-GM campaigners\nAt the top of the GM-debate headlines\nhas been the mass action \u2018Take The\nFlour Back\u2019. Anti-GM campaigners\nbehind this appeal are planning on uprooting a field of genetically modified\nwheat at Rothamsted Research on 27\nMay. The group has summed up their\narguments in an open letter by appealing to ideas of \u2018Frankenstein foods\u2019 and\nsuggesting that scientists are opening\nup a Pandora\u2019s box by using GM; they\nsay that the GM wheat being trialled at\nRothamsted has artificial genes\n\u2018most similar to a cow\u2019 and\nthat the repercussions of\nthis are unknown and\ncould be potentially di-sastrous. They are also\ndrawing on economics\nby pointing out the constrained market for GM\nwheat across the world and\nsaying that tax-payers will\nreceive very little benefit from the\nresearch they are paying for.\nRothamsted Research\nScientists at Rothamsted Research replied to the group of activists with an\nopen letter and an online video plea of\ntheir own, trying to convince the anti-GM protestors to not trash the field.\nThe tone of the researchers\u2019 message\ninvited anti-GM campaigners to come\nand have a conversation on the 27th of\nMay so that the two groups might find\na \u2018middle way\u2019. They also appealed\nto the campaigners by suggesting that\ntheir actions would undermine \u2018social\nprogress\u2019; trampling the fields would\ndestroy not only GM crops but other\nresearch which is fundamental to envi-A mass sensor has been developed by\na group of Spanish scientists, lead by\nJulien Chaste from the Catalan Institute\nof Nanotechnology, capable of weighing individual molecules, atoms, and\neven protons.\nSensors of this type, known as nano-mechanical mass sensors, have been\ndeveloped before. However, previous\ndevelopments only yielded a resolution\nof about 7000yg (yottagrams) for a mi-crofabricated sensor, and around 200yg\nfor a carbon nanotube based sensor. In\nthis development, which is an improved\nversion of the nanotube based sensor,\nthe researchers achieved a resolution of\n1.7yg, which allows weighing of individual protons.\nThese sensors work by oscillating\na resonator, either nanomechanical or\ncarbon nanotube, at its characteristic\nfrequency (the frequency at which resonance occurs, this is usually just below\nthe natural frequency). A computer can\nmeasure this frequency. When atoms\nor molecules land on the resonator, the\ncharacteristic frequency of the resonator changes, and the computer can\nmeasure this change. The change in frequency can then be used to calculate the\nchange in mass of the nanotube, which\nis the mass of the molecule or atom just\nadsorbed onto it.\nChanges by the Spanish team to\nimprove the sensitivity of the sensor\ncome in 3 parts. Firstly, to make the\nchanges in resonance frequency more\npronounced, the length of the carbon\nnanotube was shortened, with the part\nof the tube able to oscillate only being\n150nm (this is the part of the tube over\na trench). This means there is a noticeable change in frequency of the resonator even if only a few atoms are present.\nAdditionally, by cooling the system\ndown to 4K, and measuring within a\nvacuum, the error caused by other particles being present is reduced.\nHowever, the final and most important improvement was to run a small\ncurrent of approximately 8 microamps\nthrough the tube. Before this change\nwas applied, the resonance frequency of\nthe resonator exhibited much variance.\nThe team suspect this is due to other\ncontaminants in the system.\nThe team have successfully weighed\nboth xenon atoms and naphthalene\n(C10\nH8\n) to high degrees of accuracy. Future uses for this research could be into\nnew mass spectrometers, more accurately measuring the mass of incredibly\ntiny particles. However, a more closely\nlinked application of this technology could be to allow further research\ninto the nature of molecular diffusion\nthrough nanotubes, as well as investigations into the nature of magnetic particles within a nanotube.\nDOI:10.1038/nnano.2012.42\nWeighing a\nsingle atom\nPhilip Kent\nA well-known consequence of global\nwarming is rising sea levels, caused\nby the melting of polar ice as the Earth\nheats up. Now, scientists have found\nevidence that sea level rise this century\nwill fall short of the expected worse case\nscenario. A team at the University of\nWashington have found glacial flow in\nGreenland to differ from that of previous expectations. This latest research results in two main findings: that glaciers\nare moving a lot slower and that this\nmovement is not likely to slow down.\nGlaciers are responsible for the transportation of ice and snow from landmasses into the sea. This, along with\nthe direct melting of ice sheets when\ntemperatures increase, results in rising sea levels. The glacial flows from\nGreenland and Antarctica alone contribute the most to rising sea levels. A\nstaggering 250 billion tonnes of ice is\npushed into the sea each year, resulting in an annual 1.5mm increase in sea\nlevels on average. As glaciers flow, they\naccumulate more matter and move fast-er. A faster glacier will deposit more ice\ninto the sea, increasing the water levels.\nPrevious studies suggested that glacial\nflow would increase by 100% by 2010\nand eventually reach a constant speed.\nHowever, the new research estimates\nglacial flow is only increasing by 30%,\nwith nothing to suggest that the speed\nwould remain constant once this volume\nof shifting ice had been reached. In the\nlargest glaciological study conducted so\nfar, satellite data from 2000-2010 were\ncollected from over 200 glaciers and\ntheir movement patterns.\nPrevious extrapolations suggested sea\nlevels could rise by 46cm by 2100 as a\nworst case scenario. In light of recent\nresearch the movement of Greenland\u2019s\nglaciers places this increase much lower,\nat barely above 9cm. This may sound\nlike good news, but even a 30% increase\nin sea levels poses a threat to low-lying\ncountries such as Bangladesh.\nSuch contradictory findings from gla-ciological studies suggest the dynamics\nbehind glaciers are extremely complex\nand scientists do not fully understand\nthem yet. In addition, the 10-year time\nperiod may be too short for any conclusion about the end of this century to\nbe meaningful. In the meantime, more\nstudies will have to be carried out before anyone is any closer to knowing\njust how consequential climate change\nwill be during our lifetimes.\nDOI:10.1126/science.1219985\nGlaciers go slow, but they might not stop\nJessie Durk\nJuan Casasbuenas\nCommonwealth glacier, Taylor Valley, Antarctica, January 1956\nRoss Sea Info\nCrop trial at Rothamsted Research.

    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX Friday 11 MAY 2012 21\nI am an Anti-Christ, I am an Anarchist\nPlabon Saha tells of his encounter with Johnny Rotten\nReviewed in 60\nseconds\nF\nor anyone who knows about the\nhistory of punk music, they will instantly recognise the title as part of\none of the most famous songs that\nwent on to define the genre. In the\n70\u2019s the Sex Pistols, fronted by Johnny Rotten\na.k.a John Lydon, started a revolution in the music scene with just one album. To this day music\ncritics recognise that album as one of the most\noriginal pieces of work in the industry. I would\nnot bore you with my praise for that album as\nI\u2019m sure you hear enough of it from your parents\n(Not sure what you imagine normal parents to\nbe like, but you must have some seriously cool\nones \u2013 Music Ed). This is about one of the best\nnights I\u2019ve had at Imperial, when I found Mr\nRotten in Eastside bar having a pint with his\nfriends on St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\nA few friends and I went to Eastside after the\nrugby game to celebrate what was to be just\nanother night out for us at Imperial. The night\nquickly went from normal to extra-ordinary\nwhen my friend spotted Mr Lydon in the bar. At\nfirst we were sceptical about whether it was really him, as it would be odd to find a man of his\nreputation to simply be having a pint there. After looking up current pictures of Johnny on our\nsmartphones, scepticism quickly turned to fan-induced euphoria as my friend called her dad\nto inform him who was at the bar. Being nervous as any fans would be, we went up to him\nto shake his hand which to us was a privilege.\nJohnny was relaxed and quick to make jokes.\nWe laughed and, unable to make conversation,\nquickly went back to our group to revel in what\njust happened. The night took a better turn when\nmore friends of mine came to the bar and they\nwanted to go say hi to Johnny. Wanting to speak\nto him properly this time, I took a quick gulp\nof my drink and started walking towards them,\nwhich turned out to be one of the best decisions\nI will ever make.\nWith the initial awkwardness gone, I quickly\ndivulged into a conversation with Johnny\u2019s manager Rambo, with whom he has been friends for\nover forty years. Our conversation ranged from\ntopic to topic. It started off with the importance\nof pure mathematics and went on to football\nhooliganism back in the day, architecture, culture and of course music.As I listened to him tell\nstories about Arsenal football club and the pricing out of fans, I was amazed at how real these\npeople were and how we shared a few opinions,\nsuch as the ugliness of modern architecture and\nthe need for an integrated English culture. These\npeople might be more than double my age yet it\nsurprised me how well I got on with them. They\nhad stories to tell, interesting ones, and Rambo\nand Scotty, who maintains Johnny\u2019s band Public Image Limited\u2019s website was interested in\nmy story too as we chatted about bits and bobs\nof my life. They might be famous but they did\nnot come across as people drunk on fame. They\nwere normal, using that term loosely, of course.\nJohnny was the eccentric one of the lot, but not\nas crazy as one might think. After a few other\nfriends of mine had joined us, one of the loud\nmoments of the night that I recall was when\nhe shouted \u201cTHIS IS ENGLAND, MY ENGLAND\u201d as he pointed out the multicultural\ngroup that surrounded him. As soon as it was\nestablished that we were all students, I remember Johnny telling us that we are the future and\nwe need to sort this country out and not mess\nthings up like previous governments. This was\na man who cared, a man who was passionate.\nAnd I definitely shared his sentiments regarding\npolitics and the monarchy.\nOne of the other things to remember from\nthe night was about this Brazilian woman. The\nbackground info on this story is that there was a\nwoman outside the bar who works for one of the\nmany museums around South Kensington. Apparently, they are doing an exhibition on punk\nculture, which really rustled Johnny\u2019s jimmies.\nThe man who defined the genre was not consulted about this exhibition at all. Johnny asked her\nwhat she understood about punk and what the\ngenre, the culture actually meant. From what I\nrecall, her answer was something along the lines\nof \u201cpunk is all about expressing views that are\nnot so easily accepted by society\u201d. \u201cYou have\nno idea what you are talking about,\u201d replied\nJohnny, not amused at all. Personally, I would\nthink twice about telling John Lydon out of all\npeople about what punk means. As she protested her innocence, her ignorance was quickly\nunravelled as Johnny asked her how she knew\nwhat she thought she knows about punk. No\nstraight answer. I remember my friend saying\nsomething along the lines of \u201cyou can\u2019t tell the\nfounder of punk what punk means\u201d which sent\nher on her way and also got a few laughs from\nthe others. She came back with a vengeance\nlater on in the night and told me my hair is not\npunk, simply wavy. Johnny and co leapt to my\ndefence and told her \u201cTHIS IS PUNK, HIS\nHAIR IS PUNK.\u201d As someone who gets teased\nabout their haircut by their friends quite a bit,\nneedless to say that was one of the best things\nthat one of the icons of British punk could have\never said to me. And you know what the funny\nthing is? That woman came back half an hour\nlater asking Rambo for a cigarette and started\nclaiming my hair as punk. Such hypocrisy, such\nignorance, it was no surprise the guys weren\u2019t\na big fan.\nAs the night wore on and closing time beck-oned, that same woman came to say her goodbyes along with her friends, this time trying to\nappeal to Mr Lydon to the best of her ability by\nshowering him with praise. The need for celebrity approval baffles me. Even if she was a fan of\nJohnny\u2019s work it was clear that she didn\u2019t think\nvery highly of the guys there. So it was quite\nsurprising that she continued to try and gain\ntheir approval. Oh well, laughs were had and\nthat was that. As Eastside closed, we decided\nto move to the Union. It was a bit of a pain to\nget into Metric but some quick thinking on our\nfeet meant that even the guard couldn\u2019t stop us.\nJohnny got his groove on and, for once, Metric\nwas enjoyable despite the inevitable sausage-fest. We left the Union on a high, thinking about\nhow awesome the night was as we parted ways.\nI was also invited to PiL\u2019s gig at Heaven in\nApril and I just wanted to take a paragraph to\nwrite a quick review. The crowd at the gig was\nmuch older than I was but even then I definitely\nhad a good night. I started checking out PiL\u2019s\nwork after meeting Lydon and although he looks\nless of a punk rocker these days with his spectacles (And the butter adverts- Music Ed.); you\ncan still see the youthful angst in him. PiLseems\nto me a band that has experimented quite a bit\nwith their sound and will continue to experiment with it in their upcoming album, This is\nPiL. The two songs I was most fond of at the gig\nwere \u2018Disappointed\u2019 and \u2018Religion\u2019, especially\nthe latter one as it was stretched to 10 minutes\nwith bass filling the room until your ears started\nbleeding. There were no supporting acts with\nPiL playing a two hour set followed by a half-hour long encore. Some old fans may not like\nthe direction to which PiL have headed but as\na teenager who has recently discovered their\nmusic, I remain keen and interested to see what\nmore they have to offer. With Rotten working\nhis socks off, I can only hope that PiL will appeal to the old and the new simultaneously. My\nbest wishes for Johnny and co.\nAcid-fuelled madness far more in the psychedelic\nstyle than the harsh industrial abrasion of previous\noutings such as Broken Ear Record, with Mr Impossible, Black Dice successfully continue their incredible progression from their humble beginnings\nas an insane hardcore outfit and go pop. Synths\nthat don\u2019t induce headaches and catchy basslines\nsquelch under Copeland\u2019s distorted-beyond-belief\nvocals and drum patterns that vary from jazz to\nhip-hop. At some points, they even *gasp* use a\nfour to the floor. Black Dice have always focused\non honing one sound throughout a track, creating\nsonic pieces as opposed to songs, and continue\nto do so here, but there is an element of traditional structure to these tracks. The press release\ndescribes Mr Impossible as the sound of \u201ca sub-stance-fuelled basement party on Mars\u201d, and re-ally, I\u2019m never going to sum it up better than that.\nRoss Gray\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nBlack DiceMr Impossible\n2012\nPossibly the most frightening release of 2012, none\nof Factory Floor\u2019s new psychedelic live sound is portrayed on this live collaboration between two Throbbing Gristle members (Cosey Fanni Tutti & and Chris\nCarter) and FF\u2019s Nik Void. Void\u2019s growling, menacing\nguitar is combined with Tutti & Carter\u2019s squealing\nsynths in the school of Throbbing Gristle onto an\nincredibly deep, bare, ominous bass thud that runs\nthroughout the entire monstrously industrial perfor-mance. Tension is built perfectly, with each of the\nten-minute plus tracks slowly building from the absolute barebones into soul crushingly ominous atmo-spheres. Probably not one for the sunny weather, I\nwould advise waiting until a particularly suicidal moment before checking out this pretty great live record.\nRoss Gray\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nCarter Tutti VoidTransverse\n2012\nBoston Arms\nThursday 17th May\nBe sure not to miss...\nZulu Winter\nI cannot decide whether Zulu Winter\nare some sort of hipster wet dream\nor an epic stadium band in waiting.\nA show at the Boston Arms seems\nto point to the former but then a support slot for Keane\u2019s upboming dates\nsuggests otherwise.

Picasso, instead, recasts himself\nas sculptor from the classical period, bearded\nand mature, who is often depicted in the act\nof sculpting, watched by Marie Therese. The\nMinotaur, which first appears in etchings from\n1933, symbolizes forces of uncontrolled emotion and behavior. Picasso does not depict the\nMinotaur in the labyrinth (its usual mythological surrounding) but transports it into the modern world in an artist\u2019s studio amongst female\nmodels and in a bullfighting arena, the latter\nevoking a powerful atavistic topos of popular\nculture in Picasso\u2019s native land.\nPicasso uses various techniques in the etch-Smack My Etch Up\nCompetition time, again\nThe lovely folks at Festival of the Spoken Nerd have\ngiven us a pair of tickets to their upcoming sell-out\nshow \u03c0-curious at The Bloomsbury Theatre on 21\nMay.

The Great Court was dazzling in\nall its whiteness, filled with noisy and enthusiastic tourists and school groups. Making my\nway through the crowds I ventured into a part\nof the Museum that I had never experienced\nbefore: a couple of hidden rooms filled with\netchings.\nOne of these rooms is the brand new keeper\nof Picasso\u2019s most renowned series of etchings\nknown as The Vollard Suite, which includes\n100 beautiful prints produced by the Spanish\nartist between 1930 and 1937. These etchings\nwere created by Picasso for the famous Parisian art dealer and prints publisher, Ambroise\nVollard, who had promised a couple of painting in exchange for the etchings. Vollard had\nbeen planning to publish a book of the prints\nuntil his death caused by a car accident interrupted the project. The etchings were forgotten about during WW2 until dealer Henri\nPetiet purchased them: the Petiet family has\nowned them ever since. It is only through the\nimmense generosity of Hemish Parker that the\nBritish Museum has managed to display the\ncomplete set of prints, which has never before\nbeen shown to the general public.\nThe prints are displayed chronologically\nand have been divided by the curator into little\ngroups that share a predominant theme. The\nseparation though should not be considered\nas absolute: many themes overlap, disappear\nand return throughout the series, creating a\nconfused and dreamlike narrative. It is clear\nthough that the style and the stories that characterize most of the etchings are of classical\norigin: Picasso admired classicism and did not\nfeel that it was a retreat to antiquity, as he believed that \u201cif a work of art cannot live always\nin the present it must not be considered at all.\u201d\nPicasso uses characters from ancient mythology as the main subjects of his paintings: he\nfirst came into contact with ancient classical\nart in his trip to Italy in 1917. This classical\npredominance makes the British Museum the\nperfect place for the Vollard Suite to be shown:\nsculptures and vases from the ancient Greek\nand Roman periods are scattered throughout\nthe room, enabling the viewer to understand\nfully Picasso\u2019s reinterpretation.\nThree main characters star throughout the\n100 etchings: Marie-Therese Walter, the Minotaur and Picasso himself.

So how did\nwe find ourselves seeking its Accident\nand Emergency department at 11pm\non Easter Saturday?\nPuskhar, a sacred Hindu town boasting 400 temples and a stunning holy\nlake, lies 11km from Ajmer. We and\nother westerners, some of whom\nappeared to live a Hippie lifestyle\nthere, were soaking up its culture and\ncharms. The ever threatening presence\nof mosquitoes, though, had prompted a\nfriend to assemble his mosquito net, a\nnon-trivial procedure that involves attaching a cord to the ceiling. The ceil-ing, however, was already occupied by\na viscous yet ineffectual electric fan,\nrotating very quickly in an attempt to\nstave off the heat. Indeed it is not surprising that there were two capitals of\nBritish India; Delhi for the winter and\nthe Himalayan Shimla for the summer.\nWe \u201cBritishers\u201d, although cowering\nunder factor 50 sun block, sunglasses\nand hats, were still scorched by the\nRajasthani April heat.\nNeedless to say, a brief collision\nbetween person and said fan necessitated a speedy drive to Ajmer. We\nalready were familiar with the adage\n\u201cThere are three things you need when\ndriving on Indian roads, a good horn,\ngood breaks and good luck.\u201d Although\nblessed with all these, the drive was\nstill hair-raising since cows and wild\nbeasts are neither responsive to horns\nnor fitted with headlights. After a few\nextremely cheap remedial stitches\nfrom an excellent doctor, we returned\nto Pushkar, a little shaken.\nThe next day we discovered that\nAjmer had another important visitor,\nthe Pakistani president, his first trip\nto the shrine after 7 years. This followed important talks with the Indian\nPrime Minister so we felt our proximity to history in the making. Also, a\nlocal gentleman tried to persuade us\nto make a large donation at a nearby\ntemple in order to quicken recovery.\nIndeed all Indians we met found religion important. And one of their newest religions is cricket. We discovered\nthis when we joined 48,000 others to\nwatch the home team Delhi Daredevils\ntake on the Chennai Super Kings for\ntheir Indian Premier League match.

I now have a\nmuch shorter list made up of Washington DC (to which the time allocated has\nbeen extended since I watched National\nTreasure for the first time last week),\nNYC, Boston, Cape Cod, while hopefully fitting in much more of New England on day trips.\nThe real difficulty for a financially\nrestricted student planning a trip of this\nscale is finding affordable accommoda-tion.

A website\nwhere hosts can advertise their rooms or\neven entire homes for short-term stays\nat more affordable prices than hotels\nand travellers can search for somewhere\nto stay by preferred neighbourhood, local amenities, and price \u2013 it\u2019s perfect for\nthose in need of a middle ground when\nit comes to lodgings. No, I can\u2019t afford\na fancy hotel and yes, I\u2019m too princessy\nto slum it for a month. You can even\nhave a go at haggling with some of the\nhomeowners, as the prices aren\u2019t set in\nstone like they are with most hotels.\nAnd it\u2019s not merely the exclusive use\nof a toilet seat that has me drawn to the\nidea of living someone else\u2019s home \u2013 I\nlove that I\u2019ll be coming back to my own\napartment each night in New York. Not\nonly have I saved over \u00a3400 on my initial budget (which was for cheap hotels,\nbed and breakfast inns and hostels), but\nI actually prefer the location and living\narrangements of all my chosen accommodations to my originally planned\nones because I\u2019ll feel less like a tourist\nand more like a local.\nNaturally, you always need to be careful when paying for anything online but\nairbnb act as an excellent middle man\nwhen it comes to payment; they charge\nthe guest\u2019s credit card as soon as a\nbooking is confirmed and only pay the\nhost once the stay has commenced. I\u2019d\nlike to think I\u2019ve been careful enough;\nI\u2019ve contacted my hosts, checked out\ntheir verified reviews and photos,\npicked safe areas\u2026 but if you\u2019re not\nreading my travel report in next year\u2019s\nFelix, then maybe stick to the communal bathrooms.\nence as we saw Delhi crush Chennai\nwith the aid of Kevin Pietersen. We\nenvied his chance to get to know such\nan enchanting and diverse country. We\nwondered how he coped with all the\nspicy curries, the unpredictable driving and the crushing heat. And we\nmarvelled at how he managed to hit\nthe ball so far.\nHomes away from home\nFans, cricket, presidents... it\u2019s all go in Ajmer\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nFELIX Friday 11 MAY 2012 25\nThe Gormenghast Trilogy\nH\now do I describe a work\nlike Mervyn Peake\u2019s\nGormenghast Trilogy?\nThe series, by its very\nnature, seems to resist\ndescription. While often classed as fan-tasy, and while it is clear that Peake has\nbeen a massive inspiration to later fantasy authors like China Mi\u00e9ville, I tend\nto reject this label. The Gormenghast\nbooks are a truly unique creation, in a\ngenre of their own \u2013 I have never read\nanything else like them.\nThe first two novels, Titus Groan and\nGormenghast, are set in the sprawling,\ncrumbling castle of Gormenghast itself.\nSituated at the base of Gormenghast\nMountain it is, apart from the small\nmud hut village that clings to its walls,\nthe only human habitation visible as far\nas the eye can see. This is a setting without magic, elves or dragons. On the face\nof it the books could be taking place in\nour world but there is something bril-liantly, gothically, subtly off about the\ncastle\u2019s perpetual isolation and the behaviour of its denizens.\nA vast cast of richly drawn characters\npopulates the books yet they are not\nthe real focus of the series. From the\ndepressed Lord Sepluchrave, the 76th\nEarl of Groan, whose only solace in life\nis his vast library; to his son Titus, who\nlongs for freedom and a life outside\nof Gormenghast; to the ambitious and\nruthless servant Steerpike \u2013 everyone\u2019s\nlives are irrevocably shaped by the castle itself.\nThis is not a book for those who like\nfast paced action and adventure. The\nplot is slow paced and, while compelling in itself, its main purpose is to\nshine a light on the workings of the an-cient, in large parts unexplored citadel,\nand the seemingly senseless rituals that\nsurround it. We never do find out who\nbuild it or how it got in its present state\nis but, what is far more important, we\nMaciej Matuszewski looks back at Mervyn Peake\u2019s gothic masterpiece\n\u201cWhilst cool and\nedgy, it has also\ngrown rusty in the\nlast twenty years.\u201d\ndo get a feel of the atmosphere and its\nsoul.\nPeake was also a master illustrator,\nwith his drawings for Alice in Wonderland having been universally praised.\nHis work for Gormenghast is even better \u2013 the books are greatly enriched by\nhis beautiful, atmospheric line draw-ings. Rarely have I seen pictures that\ncomplement the feel of the novel so\nwell.\nThe third book, Titus Alone, focuses\non the eponymous protagonist as he\nfinally feels Gormenghast and sets out\ninto the world. This he finds to be a\nstrange place, ruled by rational but cold\nand dispassionate science. The main\nconflict of the novel is that between this\nharsh modern world and the oppresive\ntradition of Gormenghast.\nThis is noticeably the weakest book\nin the series. While I was certainly\nperturbed by his repeated depiction of\nscientists as immoral the main criticism that I have to level at Titus Alone\nis that, now that we have moved away\nfrom Gormenghast castle, there seems\nto have been a loss of focus. In many\nplaces it unclear what the author is trying to say or where the novel is leading us. The book, unfortunately, shows\nclear signs having been written during\n\u201cThe plot is slow\npaced and, while\ncompelling in itself,\nits main purpose is\nto shine a light on\nthe workings of the\nancient citadel.\u201d\n\u201cThe novel is certainly imaginative\nwith a broad scope\nin mind.\u201d\nthe long illness that eventually claimed\nPeake\u2019s life.\nThere are, however, still flashes of\nbrilliance. Despite the new setting\nPeake, for the most part, manages to\nmaintain the timeless, otherworldly,\ngothic feel of his previous work. The\ncruel and macabre theatrical recreation\nof Titus\u2019 life in Gormenghast set up by\nthe self-centred Cheeta in an attempt to\npunish him for rejecting her is executed\nperfectly. The novel is worth reading\nfor the poignant final chapter itself,\nwhich has a wonderful sense of closure,\nwith Titus finally managing to reconcile his rigid, rule bound upbringing in\nthe castle with his desire for freedom,\nwhile leaving the door wide open for\nthe sequels that Peake never managed\nto write.\nWhile I usually don\u2019t make recommendations about specific publishers,\nin this case I would strongly advise\nagainst purchasing the omnibus editions of the trilogy published by Vintage. The countless typographical errors are tantamount to sacrilege against\nsuch a great classic. While some errors\nwill always slip through their sheer\nnumber here makes it clear that nobody\neven bothered to do a proof read before\npublication. While the editions remain\nreadable you\u2019ll have a far more pleasurable experience if you buy the individual volumes of the series seperately,\nsince for these, at least, the publishers\nseem to have actually done their job\nproperly.\nPeake\u2019s haunting illustrations are a major asset of the series\n\u201cPeake was also a\nmaster illustrator and\nthe books are greatly\nenriched by his beau-tiful, atmospheric\nline drawings.\u201d\nHave you read any good\nbooks lately?
