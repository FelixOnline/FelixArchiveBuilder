    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n10\nA brief introduction\nto AlphaFold\nIn July earlier this year, the code,\nmethodology, and database behind\nAlphaFold, the protein prediction AI\nsoftware developed by DeepMind, was\nmade open source through the publication of two articles in Nature.\nAlphaFold is a major advancement in\nthe quest to predict a protein\u2019s structure from its sequence alone. In nature,\nproteins reliably fold into precise 3D\nconformations that is critical for its\nfunction based on nothing more than\nthe sequence of amino acids that it\nis composed of. In fact, mutations in\nproteins that lead to misfolding are\noften associated with disease states, for\nexample, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\nHowever, we have not been able to\nunderstand this folding process nor\npredict the 3D shape of a protein based\non its sequence alone.\nAlthough we have currently found\nsequences for millions of proteins, we\nhave only solved the structures of about\n180,000 of them. Structural biology\ntechniques have been developed to solve\nstructures experimentally: x-ray crystal-lography, nuclear magnetic resonance,\nand cryo-electron microscopy. These\nmethods involve large amounts of trial\nand error and have been limited in the\ncomplexity of proteins they can be applied to. Outside the lab, computational\nmethods have been developed to predict how a protein may fold based on\nits sequence to bypass the experimental\nresources. However, these traditionally\nrelied on using templates from experi-mentally-solved structures, which then\nimposes the same limits on the range of\nproteins they work best for.\nAlphaFold 2, which uses deep learning algorithms to predict structure to\natomic accuracy (within 1 \u00c5 or 0.1 nm\nof error), has been the most successful\ncomputational approach so far. In brief,\nAlphaFold operates with three main\nparts. The first involves constructing\nan initial model for which amino acids\nmay be in contact with each other in the\nfolded protein. Second, it uses a machine learning method called attention\nto interpret which parts of the model\nare informative, it takes the informative\nparts of the model to reconstruct an improved model for amino acid contacts,\nand the improved model is reinterpret-ed. This process occurs iteratively for a\nnumber of cycles, then the final improved model is fed through the third\npart which produces the 3D model of\nthe protein. The software will feed the\npredicted 3D structure back into the\nsecond step, and this loop occurs several\ntimes for the model to be refined.\nThe final output of AlphaFold is a\nfile containing the 3D coordinates for\nevery non-hydrogen atom in the pro-tein. It also outputs a graph showing the\nconfidence levels for every amino acid\nresidue, which allows users to assess the\nreliability of the predicted structure.\nAlphaFold is an outstanding contribution to the field of bioinformatics.\nIn the most recent blind assessment\nof structure prediction software (the\nCASP14 initiative), it significantly\noutperformed competing approaches.\nIt is considered to be the closest we\u2019ve\ngotten to solving the structure prediction problem.\n`\nThis week in Science...\nCheap new ventilator developed by bioengineers to address\nworldwide shortage\nScience Nobel Prize laureates announced\nAgroupofbioengineersatImperial,ledbyDrJosephvanBatenburg-Sherwood,havedevelopedalow-costventilatorthataimstoaddressventilator\nshortagesinlow-and-middleincomecountries.Theirdesignincorporates\non-off valves that are more widely available than the proportional valves\nthat commonly found ventilators use, and have engineered a method for\naccurately controlling them.\nChemistry:BenjaminListandDavidMacMillan\u201cforthedevelopmentof\nasymmetric organocatalysis\u201d\nPhysics: Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann \u201cfor the physical modelling of Earth\u2019s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting\nglobalwarming\u201d,andGiorgioParisifor\u201cforthediscoveryoftheinterplay\nof disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary\nscales.\u201d\nMedicine/Physiology: David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for \u201cexplaining the molecular basis for sensing heat, cold and mechanical force,\nwhich is fundamental for our ability to feel, interpret and interact with\nour internal and external environment.\u201d\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nAROUND THE WORLD...\nBepiColombo, Europe and Japan\u2019s joint mission to Mercury,\nreturns its first photos\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA) spacecraft BepiColombo conducted a flyby around Mercury on Oct 1st, during which cameras took 53 images of the planet from\n1,000 to 93,000 kilometers away.

This\n\u201cboard\u201disenrobedinsecrecy,entirely\nunmentioned on the Conservative\nParty website and with very few\nquestions answered on it from Tory\nspokespeople.

It\u2019s hard not to\ndraw a link between this paid access\nto ministers and the allegations of\ncronyism so common that a new one\nappears in the news almost weekly.\nTo ensure this piece doesn\u2019t appear\ntoo one-sided, it\u2019s also worth\nnoting that the Labour party\nsecured \u00a314 million in secret\nloans to finance their 2005\nGeneral Election campaign\n(theToriesdidalsodoalmost\nexactly the same thing).\nItappearsthatthetectonic\ndrop in party membership\nbetween the 50s and now\nhas left the party resorting to, let\u2019s\nface it, corruption and plutocracy,\nas a means to finance its activities.\nI don\u2019t think any right-minded\nindividual without a vested interest\ncould say that this is a step in the right\ndirection, and the way back seems\ncrystal clear: buy party membership.\n1950s membership levels would reap\na cool budget of \u00a370 million for the\nTory party at today\u2019s membership\nprices,dwarfingeventheeye-watering\nfee of \u00a3250,000 to join the Advisory\nBoard.

    "content": "In last week\u2019s article, we covered\nthe basics of the IPCC report and\nCOP26. One of the main topics to be\ndiscussed at COP26 is nature-based\nsolutions, defined by the IUCN as\n\u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage,\nand restore natural and modified\necosystems that address societal\nchallenges effectively and adaptively,\nsimultaneously providing human wellbeing and biodiversity benefits\u201d. This\nessentially means protecting nature as\npart of the global transition towards a\nmore sustainable way of existing.\nIn recent years, there has been a lot of\nfocus on carbon reduction and climate\nchange when it comes to sustainability,\nbut that doesn\u2019t cover the whole picture.\nThe United Nation\u2019s 17 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) includes\n\u2018climate action\u2019 (Goal 13), whilst also\ncovering \u2018life below water\u2019 (Goal 14)\nand \u2018life on land\u2019 (Goal 15). These last\ntwo goals focus on\nthe conservation,\nr e s t o r a t i o n\nand promotion\nof sustainable\nuse of aquatic\nand terrestrial\necosystems. In fact,\nleaders of the G7\nmet in Cornwall\nearlier this year to\ndiscuss the state\nof our natural world and came up with\nthe 2030 Nature Compact, from which\na key conclusion was that \u201cGlobal\nsystem-wide change is required: our\nworld must not only become net-zero\nbut also nature positive, for the benefit\nof both people and the planet, with a\nfocus on promoting sustainable and\ninclusive development. Nature, and the\nbiodiversitythatunderpinsit,ultimately\nsustains our economies, livelihoods and\nwell-being \u2013 our decisions must take\ninto account the true value of the goods\nand services we derive from it. The lives\nand livelihoods of today\u2019s youth and\nfuture generations rely on this.\u201d\nBylookingintonature-basedsolutions\nthat protect our ecosystems, we can find\napproaches which not only mitigate\nclimate change but also enhance food\nsecurity, economic development,\nbiodiversity, soil health and more.\nA great example of this is regenerative\nagriculture. When it comes to providing\nenough food to support our growing\nglobal populations, there are many\ninnovative technological solutions such\nasurbanverticalfarms,cell-culturedmeat\nandAI-poweredagriculturalapproaches,\njust to name a few; but if these solutions\nare \u2018futuristic\u2019, regenerative agriculture\nwould be akin to reverting to old ways of\nfarming.\nFarms that practise regenerative\nagriculture adopt traditional methods\nof growing food that works with nature\n\u2013 not against it. There\u2019s no prescriptive\nway to do this, but in practice, some\ncommonapproachesincludeminimising\nchemical inputs into the soil, increasing\nthe diversity of crops,\nreducing soil tillage,\ngetting animals on\nland to encourage\ngrazing and natural\nfertilisation of the\nland, using cover\ncrops and recycling\nfarm waste as\ncompost. As a result,\nthese farms end up\nwith healthier soils,\nan abundance of wildlife, cleaner water\nsystems and a piece of land that can\neffectively sequester carbon. It\u2019s not\njust about farming in a way that doesn\u2019t\ndamage the ecosystem but extending\nfurther to benefit the environment.\nDespite regenerative agriculture\nand other nature-based solutions\nhaving sound theoretical reasoning for\nimplementation, many sceptics question\nwhether nature-based solutions can\nbe just as efficient or productive as the\nexisting systems in place. Of course,\nthere\u2019s no guarantee that a farm that\nswitches from growing a monoculture of\ncorn by spraying tonnes of pesticide and\nfertilisers can immediately produce the\nsame yield or more, right after switching\nto regenerative agriculture. But the\nwhole point of nature-based solutions\nis shifting from short-term thinking\nand an emphasis on productivity\nalone to long-term sustainability and\necosystem protection. Even if the\ninherent value of sustainable practices\nisn\u2019t incentivising enough, a recent study\nby the Soil Health Institute looking at\n100 crop farmers in the US found that\nregenerative agriculture approaches of\nusing cover crops and reducing tillage\nhad profound economic benefits for\nfarmers. They reported that net income\ngrew by 85% of corn farmers and 88%\nof soybean farmers, who earned $51.60\nand $44.89 per acre, respectively. Not to\nmention that 100% of the participants\nin this study found improved water\nquality, and 83% reduced their need for\nfertilisers. Studies like this that provide\nclear evidence of the business/economic\ncase for nature-based solutions will\nbe all the more crucial in the coming\nyears for incentivising the adoption of\nsustainable, holistic practices.\nOn the topic of making the business\ncase for nature-based solutions, in\nthe corporate world, recent years\nhave seen the rapid adoption of the\nTCFD (Taskforce on Climate-related\nFinancial Disclosures) framework,\nwhich guides companies to think about\nthe implications of climate change on\ntheir business as well as opportunities to\nmitigate these risks. Now, companies at\nthe forefront of sustainable operations\nare beginning to consider the TNFD\n(Taskforce on Nature-related Financial\nDisclosures) framework, looking at the\nbroader picture of how their businesses\nmay be affected by the deteriorating\nnatural world and how they can do their\npart to improve it.\nThe dialogue is finally extending from\njust carbon-focused conversations to\nlooking at sustainability through a more\nholistic angle. Nature-based solutions\nwill only become more important as we\nprepare for the COP26.\nHow do nature-based solutions\nconbribute to the sustainability puzzle?\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nMonami Miyamoto Environment Editor\nOUR WORLD\nMUST NOT ONLY\nBECOME NET-ZERO\nBUT ALSO NATURE\nPOSITIVE\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 8TH OCTOBER 2021\n11\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nEnvironment View online here!\nNature-based solutions work with nature, not against it\nPhoto: Jonathan Kemper on Unsplash\n\n"

Years later, The British\nFilm Institute (BFI) mentioned in its documentary\n100 Years of Cinema: \u201cHorace Ov\u00e9 is undoubtedly a\npioneer in Black British history and his work provides\na perspective on the Black experience in Britain.\u201d\n\u2018Pressure\u2019isa1975feature-lengthfilmtellingthestory\nof Tony, a second-generation Black British teenager\nliving with his family in London.

Shot in a documentary style,\nPressure focuses on the social dynamics felt between\nfirst and second generation immigrant families in the\n70sLondonaseachindividualstrugglestofinditsplace\nin a society ruled by the white English. In this Black\ncoming-of-age movie, there is a disconnection between\nwhat the protagonist feels as being born and raised\nin Britain and how he is treated by his surrounding\nenvironment. For instance the fact that during the\nfilm his white friends have all gotten jobs while he\u2019s\nbeing frequently passed over and unsuccessfully chosen\nas the candidate to work.\nOr similarly, as the movie\nprogresses and he follows\nhis older brother into the\nBlack Power movement,\nhe witnesses with his own\neyes the oppressive force of\nthe police whenever a Black\nperson questions and calls\nout the racist system they live\nin. Director Ov\u00e9 successfully\ncapturesarawstoryofatheme\nnot very popular within\nthe British film industry,\nas looking back through\nthe films there is barely any\nrepresentation of black culture and its community. It\nis important to highlight that despite it being almost\n50 years since the film premiered, some of the issues\nand arguments portrayed in Pressure are still relevant\nto this day. It is definitely an emotionally impacting\nfilm for the audience but it is for sure a must watch.\nUnfortunately, it was not an easy path that the\ndirector had to take in order to develop his career\nand have a name in the industry. In a recent interview\nwith BFI, Ov\u00e9 explained his unsuccessful experience\ntrying to direct his first film, \u2018It\u2019s a very surreal film, but\nunfortunately I never finished\nit\u2019 he explained after he tried\nto raise money with friends\nand colleagues to make it on\nhis own. It was called \u2018Man\nOut\u2019 and it explores the life of\nan unemployed West Indian\nnovelist and their struggle to\ncontinuewritingevenwithout\na job. The reasons he gives for\nthisisthefactthat\u2018firstly,Iwas\na Black filmmaker, secondly,\nthe subject was too obscure\nfortheearly60s\u2019andtherefore\ncould not get enough funding\nfor the completion of the\nfilm. However, the director revealed his faith in\npossibly completing the feature nearly 30 years later.\nOv\u00e9\u2019s next film was in 1970, a documentary\noutlining the experience of an underground music\ngenre called \u2018Reggae\u2019. In an interview with BFI, Ov\u00e9\nexplained how he got inspired to create this film \u2013 he\nrealised reggae was being played in shebeens but hardly\nplayed on the radio so he therefore found a Jamaican\nrecord producer like himself in film \u2013 and with its\nfinancialhelpproducedthefilm.Itwasactuallythefirst\nfeature-length film financed by Black people in Britain\nshown by the BBC and very successful in cinemas.\nOther features directed by Ov\u00e9 include a 1978\ndocumentary called \u2018The Skateboard Kings\u2019\nabout pioneering Californian skateboarders. The\nimportance of Horace Ov\u00e9 as a filmmaker lies in\nnot only the fact that he was the first Black director\nto break into the mainstream, but also the fact\nthat he still remains having a political voice and\ncombines dramas and documentaries beautifully.\nTo this day, Horace Ov\u00e9 is a relevant icon for his\ngroundbreaking role in the film industry.

    "content": "Deep-sea mining: menace to the oceans or a new hope?\nFRIDAY 8TH OCTOBER 2021\n9\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nIn June of this year, Nauru, a small\nPacific island nation about the size\nof Camden, informed the UN\u2019s International Seabed Authority (ISA) of its\nplans to mine the seabed in its surrounding waters. By doing so, it triggered a clause, giving the ISA two years\nto finalise the regulations governing\ndeep-sea mining. Nauru is sponsoring\na subsidiary of The Metals Company\n(TMC), a deep-sea mining enterprise,\nwhich intends to mine small pota-to-shaped deposits of metal, known as\npolymetallic nodules, from the seabed.\nIf the ISA does not meet its two-year\ndeadline, TMC will be allowed to proceed with its mining operations, with\nwhatever regulations are in place by that\ntime.\nProponents of deep-sea mining argue\nthat it provides an environmentally\nfriendly alternative to terrestrial mining\ntechniques, and that, with demand for\nbatteries and electronic components\nrising, we must inevitably look to the\noceans for the metals which we so desperately need. However, many influential scientists and policymakers believe\nthat too little is known about the deep\nsea, and that a more thorough review\ninto deep-sea mining must be taken\nbefore venturing further.\nIt has become clear over the past\nfew decades that if we as humans are to\nmitigate the impact of climate change,\nwe must transition to cleaner, renewable\nenergy sources, and redesign our energy,\ntransport, and manufacturing systems.\nWind turbines, solar and hydropower,\nand electrified transport all require\nlarge quantities of metals. Commodities\nsuch as copper, cobalt, manganese, and\nnickel are used in electrical components\nand most importantly, in batteries.\nAt present, these metals are primarily\nobtained from terrestrial mines, which\ncome with their own problems. Take\nfor example, cobalt. One of its main\nuses is in lithium-ion batteries. With\nthe surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales,\ndemand for cobalt is rising, and is likely\nto increase further as diesel and petrol\nvehicles are phased out. The World\nEconomic Forum has estimated that\ndemand will increase by a factor of four\nin 2030, compared with 2019 levels.\nOver 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt supply is\nmined in one country \u2013 the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo, where major concerns have been expressed about forced\nchild labour, amongst other things. In\n2019, 14 Congolese families filed a lawsuit stating that their children had been\nforced to work in the mines and had\nbeen killed or maimed due to hazardous\nconditions.\nAdditionally, land-based metal\nextraction can cause soil, water, and air\npollution, and in humans, can cause\na whole host of cardiovascular issues.\nThe impact on local wildlife is also\nsevere; gold mining in Brazil has led to\nincreased mercury levels in fish. Whilst\nlegislature exists to regulate mining in\ndeveloped countries, the same is not\nalways true in the developing world,\nwhere mines are often located.\nThis, claim proponents, is where\ndeep-sea mining comes in. Polymetallic\nnodules contain copper, cobalt, manga-nese, and nickel, which, as stated earlier,\nare essential for batteries and electron-ics. Most deep-sea mining operations\nwill work using what is known as a\n\u2018continuous bucket line\u2019 system:\n1) Collector vehicles tethered to\na large surface ship scour the seabed,\nremoving the top 10-15cm of the seabed and collecting the nodules (metal\ndeposits).\n2) Pipes attached to the vehicles\ntransport the nodules to the surface\nvessel, where they are separated from\nthe sediment.\n3) The sediment is discharged to\nthe ocean.\n4) The nodules are transported to\nthe shore, where they are processed.\nDeep-sea mining companies claim\nthat the process is not only necessary,\nbut critical, to fulfil the demand for\nbatteries required for the transition to\nclean energy. According to MIT, the region of ocean between Hawaii and the\nmainland USA alone contains \u201caround\nsix times more cobalt and three times\nmore nickel than all known land-based\nstores\u201d.\nThe companies argue that the sooner\nwe start mining the ocean depths, the\nbetter. TMC, which is working with\nNauru, through its subsidiary, Nauru\nOcean Resources Inc. (NORI) says\nthat \u201cunlike land ores, [nodules] don\u2019t\ncontain toxic levels of heavy elements\nand producing metals from nodules\ngenerates 99% less solid waste, with no\ntoxic tailings.\u201d\nMany scientists are, however, scepti-cal. The claim of no toxic tailings is hard\nto verify, but many scientific reports\nare to the contrary. A multidisciplinary\nresearch project, known as MIDAS,\nfound in 2016, that it was difficult to\npredict resource toxicity in advance,\nand that mineral deposits would have to\nbe assessed independently to determine\ntoxic risk. However, what is highly likely is that deep-sea mining would alter\nthe ecosystem of the deep sea, potentially resulting in a loss in biodiversity.\nThe sediment, discharged from surface\nvessels could disperse far and wide, and\ncreate standing midwater plumes. Combined with light and sound pollution,\nthis could severely affect marine life.\nFurthermore, the ocean acts as a carbon\nsink, and the impact on deep-ocean\ncarbon storage is unknown.\nLooking into existing research, what\nis most clear is that the precise impact\nof deep-sea mining is ambiguous. This is\nboth because the technology for deep-sea mining is relatively new, and because\nthe depths of the ocean are still being\nexplored. It is for this reason that many\nscientists and conservationists, including figures such as David Attenborough,\nare against it for the present time. 571\nmarine experts and policymakers have\nsigned a letter calling for a temporary\nmoratorium on the practice until scientists have had time to rigorously determine its impacts. Accompanying them,\nBMW, Volvo, Google, and Samsung\nhave also pledged to exclude minerals\nsourced via deep-sea mining from their\nsupply chain, much to the disdain of the\nmining companies. The UK\u2019s current\nofficial position is aligned with this too.\nIn the meantime, the ISA have already issued 31 fifteen-year contracts for\ndeep-sea exploration. There is still some\ntime before deep-sea mining happens\nin practice; in addition to finalising the\nregulations, exploitation licenses must\nbe granted to contract holders. This\nprocess could take two to three years, in\naddition to the two years for regulations\nto be drafted. Even in this time, it is not\npossible to fully explore the potential\nimpact of deep-sea mining on the seabed and its ecology. Whether a moratorium is agreed, or the ISA pushes ahead\nwith its regulations, it is clear that the\ndecisions made by policymakers will be\nhugely important and have long-lasting\neffects on our planet and our transition\nto renewable energy.\nJamie John Science Editor\nPhoto credits: Nicolas Geiseler Toran\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\n\n"

    "content": "Watching opera is itself an act of theatre. In the\ntrivial sense, we audience have our costume and\nour lines, our exits and our entrances, but - for those\nas jejune as I am - the stage upon which this second\nperformance must be played is nine-tenths internal.\nObservation is regularly self-reflexive, but the cultural\nesteem in which opera is held raises this to the level of\na pathology; one questions one\u2019s own experiencing of\nthe show in the midst of experiencing it - \u201cam I watching correctly?\u201d, \u201cam I listening correctly?\u201d and, above\nall, \u201cam I understanding this?\u201d\nFor the most part, these are the wrong questions: the\nRoyal Opera House\u2019s production of the Magic Flute\nis entirely immediate. The plot, where it exists, is sim-ple: the prince Tamino (Daniel Behle) must rescue the\nQueen of Night\u2019s daughter from her kidnapping by the\nrationalist high-priest Sarastro (James Plott, providing\na dirge-like bass), but both find his ideals of sufficient\ncalibre that they choose to bear the trials that will lead\nto membership in his community and, by extension,\ntheir marriage. The bird-catcher Papageno (a tremendously physical Peter Kellner), the rustic id of the op-era, accompanies their ordeals and steals all the best\nlines. This is the 10th revival of McVicar\u2019s production,\nand its status as an inveterate crowd-pleaser appears unlikely to change; as a warning to the Covid cautious, I\nfailed to spot a single vacant seat.\nIt\u2019s not hard to figure out why. The music is uniformly excellent, with Aleksandra Olczyk\u2019s Queen of Night\nsingling herself out for praise. The sets are of a sufficient\nscale to impress, albeit rarely sublime (the colour-scape\nof the night sky is a noticeable miss, though the morning sun, bleeding out in poppy yellow, appears to great\neffect in the closing scenes - think a defrocked Olafur\nEliasson). On the whole, the production is fundamentally light, which aptly suits a libretto so concerned\nwith illumination.\nAnd yet, if light will provide the defining moral -and, thereby, aesthetic - triumph of the singspiel, it will\nalso inevitably cast some uneasy shadows through an\naudience in darkness. Of course the inevitable sexism\nis obliquely defanged through the staging, and the production - as is customary - elides any issues Sarastro\u2019s\nblack slaves might bring by simply making them white;\nit\u2019s the central enlightenment victory instead that sits\nso awkwardly. The fundamental symbolic regime is of\norder taming chaos - reason prevailing upon ignorance,\nmusic taming wild beasts - but the same world that inevitably drove people into watching this production\ninevitably comes in too; with an eye on it, the faith in\nrationalism that characterises the opera appears less\noptimistic than simply na\u00efve - perhaps more seriously,\nit fatally neuters the drama of the final trials. But this\nis all beside the point; you don\u2019t go to the Magic Flute\nas an intellectual exercise. You can exult reason all you\nwant, but sometimes it\u2019s better to just not think.\nThe magic flute entrances, but does not enchant\nReviewed by Felix Swift Roberts Arts Writer\nMagic Flute\nWhere?

From \u00a310\nTheatre\nI\nn more blunt terms, this is a camp where young\npeople are taught to embrace fascist Nazi ideolo-gy, and is based on the real-life former Camp Siegfried. Writer Bess Wohl was intrigued by its origin after\nspending time nearby during the pandemic, and learning of a place where children lived on Hitler Street.\nFlower beds were planted like swastikas, and teenagers\nwere encouraged to \u2018socialise\u2019 to create pure German\noffspring. It sets the scene for an interesting dialogue\non how light-hearted summer fun and romance hides\na dangerous programme of indoctrination. So subtle is\nthe messaging that, as an audience member, it is easy\nto mistake the, in hindsight, obvious signs. Both characters are susceptible to extremist ideology in different\nways. Awkward and bookish, Her (Patsy Ferran) just\nwants to be accepted, whilst Him (Luke Thallon) wants\nto be a part of something bigger \u2014 both impulses that\nultimately make them vulnerable to radicalisation.\nThe historical context creates the potential for a\npowerful story but, whilst there were many captivating moments and the subject matter was interesting,\nthere were times where Wohl\u2019s plot left something to\nbe desired. Towards the end of the play the narrative\nflatlined. In an apparent effort to make serious points\nabout the parallels between modern politics and current times, it loses itself as a drama; sometimes becoming too overt and on-the-nose with unnecessary references to Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 slogan.\nDespite this, there was never a moment where I\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nEdited by:\nVaidhiswaran Ramesh\nAlex jackson\nArts A Psychedelic Performance...\n...No Shrooms required\nBy Gurdip Uppal\n7\npage\n\n"

Opened in 1989,\nthe store has an eclectic mix of new and secondhand records. You might cry\nwhen you find a rare pressing of your favourite album that costs \u00a3100 (one\nday I will buy the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack from the Sister Ray basement),\nbut you will not leave disappointed that you couldn\u2019t find what you were\nafter.

The store covers a\nwide selection of genres, but is a go-to for dance, house\nand electronica. Lively in-stores and famous customers\nare the norm for this store, with regulars including Peggy\nGou, Caribou, and Four Tet.\nRough Trade\nRough Trade is one of the most well-known\nindependent record stores, with branches across the\nUK. Selling a breadth of indie records, the iconic\n1976 store and label have two locations in the heart\nof Brick Lane and Ladbroke Grove, and regularly\nhost signings and gigs.

It is a testament to the\nshop that massive artists (The Who, Stormzy, The 1975, Foals) play the\nstore, often for album release shows.\nWhilst the closure of the Hippodrome in 2017 ended a long-term\npartnership between the store and a local venue for gigs, Banquet regularly\nhosts gigs at local venues as well, predominantly The Fighting Cocks, and\nPryzym. Of course, the shop also has a huge collection of indie and rock\nrecords for sale. The shop\u2019s logo, \u2018more than just your local record store\u2019, has\nnever been so apt.\n\n"

    "content": "Green-washing is a term that most\nof us have come across at one point\nor another. It\u2019s a practice that preys\non people\u2019s good intention to be\nsustainable, when the product or service\nbeing sold isn\u2019t actually beneficial to\nthe environment \u2013 at least not when\nconsidering the big picture. In fact,\ngreen-washing is more common than\nwe think, and even the most popular\nsustainable alternatives have a deeper\ndimension that needs to be considered\nif we want to make truly sustainable\nchoices. Whilst no product has a perfect\nprofile in terms of environmental impact\n(everything has some impact), here are a\nfew items that intuitively might feel like\nbetter options but require a more critical\nanalysis:\n1. Almond milk\nIn recent years, there has been an\never-expanding range of plant-based\ndairy alternatives, from soy milk, oat\nmilk, rice milk, coconut milk, cashew\nmilk, hazelnut milk and more. Amongst\nthese is almond milk, one of the more\ncommonly seen options on the menu\nboards of coffee shops. However, whilst\nalmond milk performs better in terms\nof LCA\u2019s (life cycle analyses) of GHG\nemissions compared to dairy milk\nproduced under industrial farming\npractices, in terms of water usage, it\u2019s\nbad news. Many studies have found\nthat almond milk uses more water, with\nsome citing values of up to 17 times\nmore than cow milk per litre, whilst\nothers point to specific figures of 307L\nper 48oz compared to 175L for the\nsame amount. Besides the considerable\nstrain put on water usage, the process\nof manufacturing the milk from the\nnut leaves a by-product of almond\npulp which is currently not reused for\nany other purposes, resulting in huge\nvolumes of waste.\n2. Bamboo fabric\nMany apparel brands have been\ntouting their use of bamboo fabrics as\na more sustainable fabric, especially\nwhen compared to cotton, one of the\nmost pesticide-laden crops. Bamboo\ndoes have many unique properties\nthat make it environmentally friendly\n(such as not requiring any fertilisers\nand being highly renewable due to its\nfast growth). However, the process of\nconverting the plant into its textile form\nis not only highly energy-intensive if\ndone mechanically, but that in cases\nwhere chemical processing is required,\nharsh toxins leak into the surrounding\nenvironments, which often tend to be\ncountries much removed from where\nthe final products are purchased.\nAnother issue with bamboo is that\nChina is the predominant producer\nof this crop and because that makes it\nsuch a lucrative industry, farmers often\ngrow monocultures of bamboo, which\nin turn has implications for biodiversity\nand habitat loss. If you\u2019re considering\npurchasing bamboo-based fabric,\npay attention to how transparent the\ncompany is about where its bamboo\ncomes from and whether there are any\ncredible certifications for it.\n3. Coconut oil\nWhen it comes to oils, palm oil has\noften been the villain, with alternatives\nlike coconut oil taking the spotlight for\nnot just cooking but beauty-related uses\ntoo. However, one study argued that\ncoconut oil might be worse than palm\noil with regard to biodiversity impacts.\nAuthors found that 1 million tons of\ncoconut oil production threaten 18.3\nspeciesontheIUCNRedListcompared\nto 3.8 for palm oil. This is because\ncoconuts tend to be grown on tropical\nislands, which are typically biodiversity\nhotspots containing many endemic\nspecies. This finding has sparked huge\ndebate, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean\npalm oil is \u2018good\u2019 because in absolute\nnumbers, palm oil still threatens more\nspeciesthancoconutoil(thepriorcovers\napproximately 18.3 million hectares of\nland whereas the latter is 12.3 million\nhectares), and large scale monocultures\nare highly damaging regardless of what\nthe crop is. But the authors wanted to\nhighlight that coconut oil isn\u2019t all that\ninnocent either and that more data is\nneeded for consumers to make balanced\nchoices not just based on impressions\nfrom the media.\nThe point of this article is not to say\nthat you should never use the products\nlisted. Instead, the aim is to highlight\nthe complexity and multi-faceted nature\nof assessing a products\u2019 environmental\nimpact and understand that we have\nto be more critical when it comes to\nproducts labelled \u2018sustainable\u2019 \u2013 even\nthe most common ones. Ultimately,\nwe are voting with our consumption\nchoices, and even though there is no\nsuch thing as a \u2018perfect choice\u2019, it\u2019s worth\nchecking to make sure that your vote is\ngoing where you want it to.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n12 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nPODCASTRECOMMENDATION\nThe Red to Green Podcast is an excellent resource for learning how food\ncan play a significant role in\ntransitioning to a sustainable\nfuture.

I used to\nthink that phrase was too generic and\nvague to mean anything useful, but grief\nis not an experience you can prepare for.\nIt affects people in different ways, and\nyou may not understand what you are\ngoing through until you find help.\nI can\u2019t take back time and I often wish\nI handled things differently, but I can\nshare my experience with grief to hope-fullyhelpanyoneouttherefeellessalone\nor confused.\nMy dad passed away with no warning\nbeforehand, one day he was alive and the\nnext day he didn\u2019t turn up to work. My\nparents were separated, and I hadn\u2019t seen\nhim for a while, so his\ndeath was almost unreal to me. That continues to be the most\npainful part for me;\nmy dad slipped quietly from this world to\nwhatever lies beyond\nwithout saying good-bye.\nAfter his funeral I\ntried to jump back into\nmy routine as if nothing had happened.\nMy busy schedule on\ncampus also meant I\ncouldn\u2019t stay at home\nfor long, so I returned\nto London days after\nhis funeral and rarely went back home\nfor the rest of first year.\nMy dad, a former flight engineer, always stressed the importance of education to me, and I wanted nothing more\nthan his approval when I got my acceptance letter into Imperial. So, I told myself that I would bounce back, I believed\nthat I would be inspired to work hard\nand do exceptionally well in my degree\nto honour my dad.\nNow, that approach may have worked\nif it was my origin story in a Marvel\nmovie, but I am a complex human being\nin the real world so I very quickly lost\ncontrol of everything. I isolated myself\nfrom my home friends, none of whom\nknew about my dad\u2019s death because I\ndidn\u2019t know how to bring it up. I hid my\nemotional distress from my new friends;\nI told only a handful of them and reassured them that I was perfectly fine, that\nI had cried all my tears at his funeral. Really, I just wanted to be a normal fresher\nlike everyone else, not the \u2018fresher whose\ndadjustdied\u2019.Atparties,Ireliedonalcohol to relax but when that stopped being\neffective, I just pushed people away and\nstarted leaving events early to be alone.\nIn my seclusion I could finally relax, or\ncry. Eventually, I skipped tutorials and\nlectures because I felt ashamed of how\nbehind I was. I felt embarrassed by how\nunorganised and stupid I must have\nlooked to my peers, but I didn\u2019t want\npity, so I accepted the judgement. I had\njust enough energy to focus on revision\nfor the subjects I liked but I gave up on\nthe others as I was certain that I would\nbe kicked out of Imperial after my exams\nanyway.\nAt the end of my first year, I couldn\u2019t\nrecognise myself. I had worked so hard\nto get into this university, I had good\nfriends, and supportive family and yet\nI wanted to just disappear. Despite the\nemotional whirlpool I was in, I thought\nI could fix things alone and I refused to\naccept that I was where I was because of\ngrief. I rationalised that I had no right\nto still be upset months after my dad\u2019s\ndeath, so much so that I didn\u2019t apply for\nmitigating circumstances for my exams.\nWhenIreturnedhomethatsummer,a\nshell of my former self,\nI crashed instantly. All\nI did was sleep, eat,\nand watch Netflix. Honestly I\ndon\u2019t remember much from\nthat summer;\nI was simply in a\ndeep\nhole and my confusion at how I got\nthere was the dominant emotion.\nDuring my second year, I was fortunate to receive some free counselling\nthrough the College\u2019s Counselling Service, this was before the first lockdown.\nAlthough it took that lockdown for me\nto see progress, it was my Counsellor\nwho helped me to understand that my\nfeelings weren\u2019t irrational. Instead, the\npressure I put on myself to succeed was.\nThey helped me to recognise the harm\nI had done in trying to bury the reality\nthat my dad had died. If I had accepted\nthat I was grieving, I could\u2019ve recognised\nand dealt with the stages of grief appro-priately. I could\u2019ve asked my department\nfor more help and advice \u2013 I only realised later that I could\u2019ve taken a year out.\nMaybe my friends wouldn\u2019t have been\nso confused by my sudden behavioural\nchanges, and maybe I would\u2019ve spoken\nto my family more about how hard I was\nfinding everything.\nI did find peace in the isolation, hence\nonce I stepped back into social situations with other students I started to\npanic. I could feel myself regressing but I\nwas able to push through by journaling,\nsightseeing, walking, painting, music,\npodcasts, and talking to my close family\nand friends \u2013 I was finally able to accept\nmy emotions and be kind to myself.\nI can\u2019t take back the time I lost to\ngrief, stress, fear, and anxiety. I can only\nlook forward and try to learn from\nwhat I went through. When I slowly\napproached my loved ones again, I was\nconsistently humbled by how forgiving\npeople were to me despite my stubborn\nintroversion. I had spent so much time\nin my head that I was certain they hated\nme, but they forgave me and accepted\nme. Most importantly though, I eventually forgave myself.\nI\u2019m still not where I want to be,\nbut I am very proud of how far I have\ncome. There was a point in time where\nI couldn\u2019t talk about my dad without\ncrying, and now I\u2019m writing an article\nabout grief.\nSo, as clich\u00e9 as it may sound, time really does heal wounds.\nGrief, student life & solitude\nAnonymous\nSlightlyanxiousstudent\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n24 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment\nI THOUGHT\nI COULD FIX\nTHINGS ALONE\nAND I REFUSED\nTO ACCEPT\nTHAT I WAS\nWHERE I WAS\nBECAUSE OF\nGRIEF.\n\u201c\nYou don\u2019t have to be alone\nPhoto credits:\nLiza Summer on Pexels\n\n"

I scanned into Ethos\ngym last Sunday, still mic\u2019d up, of course, wearing\nmy trademark head to toe lycra I always wear when\nworking legs.\nI was half way through my warm-up cartwheels\nwhen from the corner of my eye I saw a silver fox\npushing some impressive weight. As I righted myself\nand pulled the lycra mask away from my eyes, I\nrealised I was looking at Hugh Brady, Presidentdesignate, dripping like Niagara as he bicep curled\n150kg in each arm.\nSlightly awestruck but ever a professional, I tapped\nmy mic to check it was working, winced from the\nfeedback, and strolled over to ask Brady a thing or\ntwo about his plans for Imperial College.\nI arrived just as he was finishing his set. \u201c124, 125,\ndone\u201d he muttered, and dropped the weights directly\nonto the toes of a nearby fresher as he looked up at\nme. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, apparently unperturbed\nby the screams of \u201cwhy the fuck did you do that?!\u201d\nand \u201coh no, my toes, my beautiful toes\u201d.\n\u201cHi Hugh, Anton from Felix, pleased to meet you.\nWhat\u2019s your main goal within the first 2 years of your\npresidency of the College?\u201d I asked confidently.\n\u201cMental health, always mental health\u201d he replied\nwithout pausing for thought, then got up and\nwandered over to the bench press.\n\u201cAre you worried about filling shoes as large as\nAlice Gast\u2019s?\u201d I called out after him. Hugh arrived\nat the bench, slotted himself underneath the bench,\nand began pushing it upwards, along with the rugby\nplayer pressing 140kg who was already using it. At\nthe peak of his second rep, he cocked his head to\nlook at me again and responded.\n\u201cNot at all. My feet are way bigger than her\u2019s, we\nalready measured\u201d. Accepting that my analogy had\nrocketed over his head, I turned away with a wry\nsmile, pleased with the dirt I had uncovered and\neager to report back to the studio.\nAnd that\u2019s all from Anton today. We don\u2019t really\nknow what he meant by that last bit, and he has,\nagain, not come back to the studio since sending that\nin.

We all learn\nin different ways, and it\u2019s important that we let our\nnatural personality shine through in a classroom or\nlecture hall setting as we interact with the lecturer and\nour peers to further our knowledge in the lecture of\nconcern.\nFor that reason, the Investment Society in\ncollaboration with Imperial College\u2019s Finance\nSociety is bringing back the former\u2019s Securities and\nEducation Certificate (SEC) in person, in order to\nprovide the most authentic learning experience that\nwe\u2019ve all missed before Master Boris shut down the\ncountry in March 2020.\nSo, what is it about? Really, it\u2019s a course that\ncovers the fundamentals you will need for a career\nin investment or finance. We cover everything from\nthe workings of sales and trading to touching on\nquantitative analysis and the organisation of an\nInvestment Bank. It\u2019s split into 4 lots of 2-hour\nsessions, and they take place every Saturday at 10 am.\nIt\u2019s designed to be an enjoyable learning experience no\nmatter how much experience or competency you\u2019ve\npicked up from exposure to the finance world \u2013 we\nguide you throughout the whole way and make sure\nthat you understand every part of each lecture slide.\nWe\u2019ve covered the \u2018what\u2019, so the next logical\nquestion is \u2018why\u2019? Why does such a lecture course exist\nin the first place? Well, let\u2019s look at it firstly from a\nstudent perspective. Many of us are STEM students\n(alongside the business school cohort as well), and for\nmany of us in question, Economics and Accounting\nterms are often alien in nature and in explanation.\nWhen I first started trying to read into investment,\nI couldn\u2019t work out what a Discounted Cash Flow\n(DCF) was about. It felt like falling into a rabbit role\njust going from a DCF to a discounted rate to a cost of\ncapital and so on and so on until I came full circle and\npretty much found myself exactly where I started.\nInvestment isn\u2019t hard \u2013 it\u2019s badly taught. If you teach\nsomeone a concept in a terrible fashion, they\u2019ll always\nbe terrible in their understanding no matter how\neasy the concept in question actually is. That\u2019s what\nwe\u2019ve addressed in the SEC. We\u2019re teaching you the\ntechnicals in a way that\u2019s clear to interpret and can also\nbe understood by an 8-year-old.\nThe second reason is Google. I hate Google. No,\nactually \u2013 I was receptive to Google growing up as\nthe search results actually gave me the answer to all\nthe questions in my Maths and Science homework\nproblems and it was, in actual fact, a very reliable\nsearch engine.\nSadly, Google is more washed up than the concept\nof Imperial Athletes \u2013 a broken, unthought framework\nthat fails to deliver and only serves to frustrate the end\nuser with widely inconsistent algorithms and terrible\nlack of consideration and disregard for the end user in\nquestion.\nI cannot Google a single finance concept without\nhaving the same 3 websites show up in the first set\nof results\u2026 Why would I want them in my search\nwindow?! They\u2019re websites that don\u2019t deserve to be\nat the top. Even Wikipedia is a more understandable\nsource, and it\u2019s probably written by a graduate with a\nPhD in the topic in question. I struggle to understand\nhow Google always continually coughs up the most\nbland and incoherent articles for financial concepts\nrather than giving me a clear source that\u2019s written for\nthe average end-user to understand.\nWhat can we do as the Investment Society? We can\nmake our own resources! Sod Google for all I care,\nthe lecture course can be our way to cut through the\nhorse manure and actually tackle the main concept\nat hand, without any waffle. Our lecture course really\ndoes teach you about both the finance and investment\nindustries without having to rip your hairs out on\nGoogle or any other equivalent search engine.\nTo end, it\u2019s probably a good idea to tell you how\nyou can sign up for the SEC. You can sign up on our\nMicrosoft forms at investmentsoc.com/SEC. Fill out a\nfew details about who you are, what course you do and\na small bit of contextual data as part of our selection\nprocess.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email us at\nicu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk and we\u2019ll be\nhappy to help!\n\u201c\u201d\nLet\u2019s do things the proper way.\nVirtual lectures? Pfft...\nThis was the subject of an article on \u2018The Conversation\u2019, and it partly concerned Google\u2019s adamancy on maximising revenue from advertising and constantly\nfiddling its algorithm to optimise (i.e. improve) its search results. Websites are also cheating their way to the top of the results page, which doesn\u2019t help.\nON THE SUBJECT OF RESEARCHING INFORMATION, WHY IS GOOGLE GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE?\nAhmad Danesh\nInvestment Editor | Head of Editorial, ICIS\nIt\u2019s only been 18 months and virtual lectures are\nalready out of fashion \u2013we\u2019re going to show that.\nFRIDAY 8TH OCTOBER 2021\n21\nInvestment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Ahmad Danesh\nInvestment Events are back\nEvent listings page\nvolume 2\n2\npage\nInvestment Society\nImperial College London\nAn eager individual scribbling away at an Investment Society workshop, 2019.\nSADLY, GOOGLE IS MORE\nWASHED UP THAN THE CONCEPT\nOF IMPERIAL ATHLETES...\nSEC Logo Design by Annie Szeto\n\n"

London\u2019s\nrecord shops are intricately linked with its music scene,\nwith stores such as Sister Ray, Rough Trade, Next Door,\nand Banquet records regularly hosting gigs and DJ\nevents, be it at local venues or within the record stores\nthemselves. The stores are little gems of music history\nand knowledge, where you can traipse the steps where\nAmy Winehouse used to shop for records or where\nOasis shot their album cover for \u2018What\u2019s the Story\n(Morning Glory)?\u2019; emporiums of music culture that\nhave survived the waves of vinyl and retail\u2019s fall and\nresurgence, and that were instrumental in the formation\nof loved annual events such as record store day.\nAll Ages Records\nCamden\u2019s All Ages Records is a sanctuary for punk\nand hardcore fans. The DIY store still sells cash-only\ngigticketsoverthecounterandhasaplethoraofstock\nfrom local up-and-coming bands. The walls are full of\nposters advertising gigs, and notices asking for band\nmembers \u2013 maybe you will see a sign that recruits the\ndrummer for the next Nirvana.\nThird Man Records\nThird Man is the newest addition to the London record\nstore scene, having only opened on 25th September 2021. It\nis the third branch of the store founded by the White Stripes\u2019\nfrontman Jack White, and the first in the UK. The record\nstore is full of weird and wonderful attributes, such as a\nvending machine that dispenses books with the use of Third\nMan tokens, and an intimate music venue called \u2018The Blue\nBasement\u2019. Perhaps the most unique attribute is the recording\nbooth where anyone can record music straight to vinyl. Third\nMan is worth the visit even for those who are not avid vinyl\ncollectors, simply for the experience the store offers.\nHonest Jon\u2019s\nHonest Jon\u2019s is the oldest record store on this list, established in\n1974onPortobelloRoad.Alongsideofferingarangeofjazz,blues,\nfunk, reggae and soul records, the store also has a label of the same\nnamefoundedwithDamonAlbarn.Storefounderandsociologist\n\u2018Honest\u2019JonClarefoundedthestoreinanoldbutchers\u2019shop,and\ndescribes how suppliersofthebutcher\u2019swouldpayforjazzrecords\nin raw meat. Whilst they don\u2019t trade in beef anymore, you can still\npick up a huge collection of secondhand jazz and blues LPs.\nNext Door Records\nNext Door was opened just over a year ago after the first\nlockdown, just around the corner from Shepherd\u2019s Bush Market.\nIt maybe fits better under the description as a trendy caf\u00e9-slashbar that happens to sell records, instead of a record store that also\nsells drinks, but nonetheless the store has a collection to suit all\ntastes.Withafocusondanceabletracks,theshopfrequentlyhosts\nDJ sets in-store, as well as pop-up restaurants and vintage clothes\nmarkets.\nAMS RECORD STORE\nCRAWL\nIf you want to visit some of these record stores\n(and a handful of central London pubs) and meet\nsome other people from Imperial who have strong\nthoughts about which King Gizzard album is\nbest, make sure you don\u2019t miss Alternative Music\nSocieties Soho record store pub crawl.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nARTS\nHayward Gallery - for the uninitiated, sits on\nthe southern bank of Thames (once home\nto yesteryear\u2019s avant garde), at the end of\nWaterloo bridge right along side its humble compatri-ots, the Royal Festival Hall, and the National Theatre\nwithin the Southbank Centre. Proud in its brutalist\narchitecture, it flaunts its naked concrete at us while inviting us over to its latest exhibition \u2014 \u201cMixing it up:\nPainting today\u201d.\nBilled as an exposition of contemporary UK paint-ers; the exhibition brings together 31 remarkably talented artists under one roof; And through its serving of\n130 exhibits, it offers everything to the viewer from abstraction to surrealism; oil on canvas to painted puffed\nrice and relief work; political commentary to moralism\nand more. Arranged in a vast gallery space spread over\n2 levels, the exhibition achieves nothing better than it\ndoes in showcasing its variety - in form, narrative, con-text, medium and technique.\nAnd the art works, clustered together by artists, is\npresented well to exposit this aspect right from the\nbeginning. We are greeted as soon as well enter by the\nsharp fluorescent chromatones of Lubiana Hamid\u2019s\n\u201cThe Captain and The Mate\u201d. Two figures centre stage\nlook straight ahead, with a focussed singular perspective on us; We are viewers to each other. Vivid use of\nshape lines and bright colours and contours that conveys a multi-dimensionalism to the painting. And almost in abject contrast - lies nearby work by Sophie\nvon Hellermann, full of haze and dreamy motifs. In one\npainting, a German women, naked, runs away from a\nBritish spitfire during WW2. Rendered by Hellermann\nwith a neutral, more withdrawn colour palate, in contrast to the brazen bright colours of Hamid\u2019s work, it\nbrings out the subtlety of the horror behind the painting without being over the top. And this variety set in\ntone between works only builds as one moves through\nthe landscape - with each artist comes a completely\nnew perspective, technique, and context to painting\nand the medium.\nIn Kudzanai-Violet Hwami\u2019s Biro, her \u2018western man\u2019\nsits with brooding eyes against a backdrop of a colonial map of rural Rhodesia. Dressed in a suit, he drinks\nfrom an Bira looking ahead, the pain in his eyes - ours\nto share. The map in the backdrop is painted over by\nhuge swathes of blue. The social commentatory on this\nis not lost \u2013 and again following the muted undertones\nof Hellermanns\u2019 work \u2013 contrast!\nNext comes Jonathan Watering\u2019s series of couch\npaintings - photo-realist paintings of every day life.\nBrought about without an overt commentary - political or otherwise; Followed by abstract work by Hurvin\nAnderson and on and on\u2026\nThese examples cited above are but only a few that\nhighlight the rich landscape of contemporary British\nwork that \u201cMixing it up\u201d so masterfully juxtaposes.\nThere is too much talent here in this exhibition to pursue discussion and discourse on each artist and paint-ing. But this very breadth does beg the question \u2014 at\nwhat point is all this too much? After a plethora of\npaintings of variety; each ever so different from the last\nbut just as meaningful - it does all tend to coalescese,\nblur... exist as one. And to be clear the number is the\nculprit here, not the art - and certainly not the artists.\n31: why did the curators chose 31? Why not 30 or 20\nor even 10 for that matter?\nSo what we have at the end of the day is an exhibition\nthat has got all the right ingredients but fails to hit the\nperfect mark: Much like the brutalist architecture of\nthe gallery that houses it \u2014 the breadth and brazenness\nwith which the works are displayed here jars the viewer\ninto submission by the end. However, despite the palette being this broad, with such quality one can forgive\nthe proportions of the paint in the mix.\nStopping for a bit to collect my thoughts after this\npromenade, I inevitably found myself dragged to a\npainting by Luca Brice, overleaf Lubiana Hamid\u2019s \u201cThe\nCaptain and The Mate\u201d, at the beginning of the exhibi-tion. Featuring dark palettes of blue and red, a lady with\na smoke in her hand peers through a half open door to\neither wave us goodbye, to share her a smoke or to greet\nus; all while a shrouded mysterious figure hangs around\nthe back. For equal measure, there was also a black cat\nperched comfortably across the threshold, screeching\nat us for presumably disturbing its quiet feline life!\nLeaving the exhibition with this picture in mind, I\u2019d\nlike to think there is a story being told here, of the type\ntold in hushed corners, featuring dimly lit quarters,\nsmokes, felines, and the silhouettes of a women behind\nhalf closed doors. Perhaps not a story - must be a secret\nthen!\nSo spare an afternoon (or a day) and knock on these\nconcrete pillars, listen close to the lady, her cat, and the\nrest of her cohort \u2013 and I think they might just share\nthat secret with you as well \u2013 listen close \u2014 (for as you\nmight discover yourself ) about just how much more\nthere is to contemporary British art than Banksy!\nContemporary art \u2014 mixed up!\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\nMixing it Up:\nPainting Today\nWhere?

    "content": "FRIDAY 7TH OCTOBER 2020\n7\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nW\nhere lies the boundary between reality\nand fantasy? Imagination and neuroses?\nDelusions and spiritual awakening? Most\npeople may not instinctively turn to an 19th Century\nWelsh chapel to reflect on these philosophical ques-tions. However, Inna Dulerayn\u2019s \u201cMythosphere\u201d forces\nyou to confront these existential questions in the comfort of a grand Presbyterian church.\nJust off the buzzing roads of China Town, the Stone\nNest was the perfect venue for this multimedia produc-tion. The grade II listed church, currently undergoing\nrestoration after having been neglected for many years,\nwith its stripped back walls and the eerily empty basement made it feel as though you had intruded into a\nsecret underground cult. Conveniently, this felt intentional and in line with the style of the performance,\nand made you feel fully immersed until you left with\nthe strange unease of seeing something you weren\u2019t\nsupposed to.\nThe play is structured in two acts. Act 1 follows\nEdyta Budnik, playing a young girl who reads out\npages of her childhood diary,\ndetailing her experiences and\nbeliefs about magic, and how\nthis comes into conflict with her\nfriends around her. Her monologues of feeling dejected and\nloss of magical powers are punctuated with enchanting operatic\nsinging from a chorus of mystical birds. The acoustics of the\nchapel made the singing feel that\nmuch more transcendental, aptly setting the tone for what was\ncoming up. However, at times the\nopera singing was excessive and\nfailed to move the plot forward\nin any way.\nThe pacing of act 2 was much better where we\ninstead follow a granny (played by Lucienne Deschamps) who is trying to find the line between what\nare her delusions and what she can trust from those\naround her. There is an R. D. Laing-eqsue exploration of medicalisation of mental illnesses as we listen to the granny narrate her narcotized morning\nroutine prescribed by her therapist. We learn that\nthe \u2018symptoms\u2019 which she was facing were really\nsupernatural powers being blocked by modern attitudes against spiritualism.\nThere should be special acknowledgement of the\ncreative team who made the story come to life with\nprojections of fantasy worlds onto a mesh screen in\nfront of the actors, and the sound design crew who\ntied the entire atmosphere together. The avant-garde\ncostume design by Anna Smirnova was truly breath\ntaking and is something I shall never forget! Whilst\nthe plot was incohesive and unnecessarily drawn\nout at times, the sensory experience of the show\nwas truly remarkable thanks to the flawless execution from the creative team. \u2018Mythosphere\u2019 is an unforgettable show for many reasons, and is one that\nmust be experienced first hand to be understood.\nA Psychedelic Performance Without the Shrooms\nReviewed by Gurdip Uppal Arts Writer\nMythosphere\nWhere? Stone Nest\nWhen? Until 9th October, 2021\nHowmuch? From \u00a38\nTheatre\nSpirituality conforming to modern society\u2019s view on mentally health!\nCredits: Photo/Helen Murray\nLuke Thallon (Him) and Patsy Ferran (Her)\nCredits: Photo/Manuel Harlan\ngenuinely zoned out, largely due to the stellar performances of Thallon and Ferran whose talent will keep\nyou completely absorbed from start to finish, regardless of the dialogue. It\u2019s hard to make a play so engaging\nwhen there are only two actors on the stage. Olivier\naward-winning Ferran gave me goosebumps during the\nscorching monologue of Her\u2019s Hitler Day speech, and\nthe way in which she develops character is complex and\ngripping. It is easy to see the mesmerising chemistry between her and Thallon.\nThe set design matched the tone of the play; howev-er, it sometimes felt as though the stage was too large\nto be so empty. Perhaps the experience would have\nbeen better in a smaller space, more representative of\nboth the senses of intimacy and claustrophobia developed through the play. Rob Casey\u2019s lighting is beau-tiful, particularly as the relationship between the two\ncharacters builds up. However, at one point the light\nis shined into the audience\u2019s eyes which I don\u2019t think\nanyone enjoyed.\nRegardless of these minor points, I still highly\nrecommend you see this production to, if nothing\nelse, experience the range and depth of Ferran and\nThallon as actors.\n\n"
