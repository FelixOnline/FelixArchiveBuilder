Imperial College Union,\nSouth Kensington, S.W.7.14 th, February,1950 Dear Sir,I am asked by the Fhoenix Board to seek space in your\ncolumns for a general plea to the officers of all clubs and\nsocieties to see that accounts of their several activities are made available to that venerable bird. For the most part terminal summaries would suffice to enshrine your memory: but if outstanding events ( for example\nthe Judo Club's televising) are not set down immediately those trivial details, which are in fact so important to lend humour and humanity to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative, become lost without trace, submerged in the\nneighbourhood of the bar. The \"Phoenix Review\" of the year is to be on sale at\nthe Rector's Tea on the Monday preceeding the first day of\nnext session. There in lies the golden opportunity to catch the \" floating fresher\" with the epic bait of your record to posterity if you follow me 1\nA permanent record has been long lacked by the Union. If we are to have one it should certainly be as complete as\nis possible. But what the Phoenix has not been told, the\nPhoenix cannot preserve and. retell. Yours sincerely, A. V.S. de Reuck.\nEditor\" Phoenix\".51, Woodland Drive, Watford, He rts.24 th, February,1950.\nSir. Being ourselves keen addicts of Dixieland music, and\nhaving heard that I.C. possessed a traditional style Jazz Club as recently as 1 9 4 6 ( sic), we are contemplating the\nreformation of such a Club within the College. Of course, we would like to have some idea, in advance,\nof our prospective support, especially as we must have a certain numbers of supporters before we can. approach the\nSocial Clubs Committee for recognition. Would any reader interested in, and willing to support, our venture please drop a note to that effect in either of\nour racks. Yours, Peter G. Taylor, Derek Hughes.\nR.C.S. "

    "content": "1 -EDITORIAL.\nSATURDAY MIGHT.\nBy ancient custom, Saturday night is the night when\nmen relax from the ard ours of th^ir week's work, and seek\nsocial entertainment to provide that relaxation. At college it is the time when students can get together to discuss affairs of the moment with, to use an RAP expression, the\nhangar doers well shut; when men can assuage the great thirst caused by the afternoon's manly pursuits, and to fortify themselves for further pursuits; when men, working with men\nduring the week, seek the company of women.\n'^he Union provides us with ample op oort unity to enjoy\nour Saturday nights in all these ways. We have a comfortable lounge in which to s it and talk, a bar to provide fortification and a dance which provides a large and varied selection of\nfeminine company. It is true that the quality of the beer\nis su cn as to drive many of the more discriminating drinkers to the taverns, but this is a subject into which there is' no need to diva gate, since it is already under active cons ider atl on. It is an encouraging sign of the increased interest of\nthe College in its social affairs that these Saturday night \"hops\" have become so popular recently. Unfortunately this popularity has spread to other colleges and outside individuals, but as we have seen in our correspondence columns, this is a matter which can best be dealt with by our own students; the interlopers are usually fairly easy to pick out when they\nfirst arrive, and by their conversation, and every member of\nthe Union has a right to ask them to leave. There is, however, one thing that detracts a little from the pleasure of the evening, and that is the over cr evading of the bar. Those whose main preoccupation is with their thirst are usually sufficient to fill the bar,, so that the\ndancers, trying to get their well earned drinks during the\ntangos and rumbas, have the greatest difficulty in getting served. We understand that at one time the server yin the Upper\nDining Hall was used as a bar, and this idea deserves consideration. The other alternative Would be a temporary\nbar in the lounge. An extra bar is always run at Carnivals, with voluntary barmen, and we can see no reason why this System should not be extended, to Saturday nights. GENERAL ELECTION.\nThis must surely have been the quietest General Election at I.C. in the history of the College. A pert from a discussion of the party manifestoes by the Political Society, and that ill attended, there has been no activity at College to indicate that anything out of the ordinary was occurring: no\ndebates, no posters, no mass me;, tings and no rags except for a small. group who joined the throng in trie West End on\nThursday. The only spark of interest that was shown was on\nFriday, when the lounge was crowded while the re si;lts wore\ncoming in, and one student took a portable wireless to his2 o' clock lecture. Was this due to apathy, or to a feeling that an Election was too s rio usa matter for old fashioned student pranks?\nProbably the latter, but it seems a pity that t lr time is apparently past when' a man might look back with' nostalgia on\nhis student days as the days of his gay and wild youth. There\nis much.to be said for the old Idea of sowing one's wild oats\nwhen still young.\nOwing to the fact that lie will shortly b=3 going to Cornwall, Mr. J.K. Booth has resigned as Sub Editor, and Mr.\nC.M. Hargreaves has been appointed to the post. "

Dear Sir,I should like to offer some comment on your latest Editorial, by trying to put the case for some of the poor\n\"10 till5\" men.\"\nMany Students live at home, because of the high cost of\nlodgings nearer College. In consequence they spend several hours a day travelling, time which more fortunate people can\nspend enjoying College Club facilities. Leaving I. C.at5 may just allow a meal by 7, and a start on \" soaking up more\nScience\" by So' cloak. Briefly, the tired Student fails to understand lectures, and gets more tired trying to\" sort them out\" at home.-Non-scientific pursuits are neglected under threat of the all important examinations . The only real cure for this type of\n\"day student\" is, as you say, more Hostel ac como dati on. Unless and until this can be provide d,I.C. is better described as a\" Technical College\" than as part of a University. Conversely, Peter Taylor's remarks apply more to Hostel residents than to others. Whilst agreeing with most of his suggestions, might I pro oo se that the ideal solution to the problem of fostering full College unity, without imposing a narrow outlook, would be Hostels in which Students from\nseveral Colleges and Faculties could live together. \u2022 Yours faithfully, \"Non-Resident\"\nADVERTISEMENTS.\nLOST.

    "content": "I.C. BRAVES THE FLOODS.\n- 8 -The sun shone kindly on a swift flowing Thames the\nweekend before last, when the Boat Club's first two eights rowed up from Putney to Sunbury and back, accompanied on the\nbank by their coaches, Charles Bristow. and Derek Coomber.\nThe journey upstream on the Saturday was without much\nincident. The first VIII had two attempts before safely navigating the narrow arches of Richmond Bridge and the\ncoaches struggled manfully in and out of the potholes on\nthe tow-path between Richmond and Twickenham.\nA welcome break for\" eleven ses\" at Kingston enabled weary\noarsmen to stretch cramped limbs and compare blisters. Sunbury was reached some five hours after leaving Putney.\nWhile only about 20 miles by the map it was reckoned that the\nboats had. travelled nearer40 through the water, owing to the swiftness of the current.* remarkably fine lunch was provided by the \"Magpie\"\nat Sunbury. The discovery that William Younger's No. l Scotch Ale was sold there nearly wrecked the crews' training programme, after lunch the crews paddled back to Molesey\nwith considerable spirit and., indeed, were barely restrained by their coaches from rowing straight over the weir. As it was, there were s ome anxious moments during which boats and\nfishing lines because curiously involved, and remarks were\npassed between anglers and coaches which would have done\njustice to an election meeting. The boats were left for the night at Molesey Rowing\nClub's boat house. Thanks, Molesey.\nThe crews reassembled stiffly on Sunday morning and rowed\nupstream to the Magpie for a lunch which, if possible, was\nbetter than Saturday's. The Magpie sold out of Younger's No.l during lunch. The return journey, with the stream, taxed the coaches'\npedalling powers to the limit. In fact, after leaving Twickenham\nwhere there was a pause for tea, the coaches lost the crews\nentirely and it was only after a phenomenal display of sprint cycling that they caught up with the second VIII at Chiswick, while they never saw the first VIII at all. The trip was completed under cover of darkness, giving the oarsmen a most impressive, but quite spurious, impression of great speed, baffling the coaches, and annoying a Police launch which commented acidly on the lack of navigation lights. There were, however, no collisions, and the crews returned safely to the boat house to revel in. hot showers and ela stop last. Footnote.

    "content": "PROFILE: JANE.\nPop down Exhibition Road after that early lecture and\njust beyond Cromwell Road you will find yourself outside 'Jane Browns'. Enter and you will meet Jane, who will give you a dazzling smile and a cup of coffee( the latter costs4 d). Jane and her parlour have become an institution with I.C. men. Any morning after eleven you will find there a coterie of I.C. coffee bibb ers swopping yarns and. gossip amidst the general hubbub of Kensington Dowagers and fair young things. And its popularity is largely due to Jane\nherself who1, with a toss of her head and a wink in her eye\nis ready for all comers.\nOf Jane we could write a three vol um< novel. Contenting ourselves with this page we may say that she is six feet of\nvery agreeable blonde, has blue eyes, dimples and a most\ndisarming smile. She bubbles over with life, admitted to being at home in\" a slightly frothy atmosphere\", and proved her point by taking me to the Hoop and Toy for a pint. Reclining a cigarette... i/ ith the words \" I've no room left for that vice\", she proceeded to unravel something of her colourful life. She\nwas born at Bosham, Sussex of Irish and French parents, on a date between 1910 and 1930.Married-no less than three times\n(she has a daughter at school) she is now a widow. \"A merry\nwidow\", she laughed, \"and its such fun\". Asked her views on\nmen, her eyes lit up:\"0hI think they' re delightful creatures especially those bearded giants from your college\". As for her own sex she dislikes women M.P's and women in authority generally. \"Give me men as Men and. women as Women\", she\ncon eluded. During the war Jane was with the American Red Cross\nalternating three months really hard work with three months\nreally hard play. We tentatively wondered if one of her husbands had been American but she firmly quashed the Idea, with mock indignation.\" They were all true born Englishmen\" she announced, quaffing at some length at her pint as if to Illustrate her answer. Jane has been with \"Jane Brown's\" since last October, and lives in South Kensington quite near College. She related that one evening a student telephoned her( no numbers, no pack drill) asking after rooms, saying that the YMCH had given him the number.\"Well you can imagine\nI was astounded,\" said Jane,\" and I had to tell him gently that I was the last person with whom the Young Men's Christian' Association would wish. to place the welfare of their Young\nMen'.\"\nMany w rill know Jane as the fearless driver of the Yellow Teri l, her1928 Rolls Royce which may be seen about South Kensington. She is a little anxious lest the Science Museum\ncast covetous eyes on it. It is whispered that it runs on\nchampagne and, knowing Jane, this is probably true. She gave\nme a lift from the pub. and drove me to the end of Prince Consort Read. I tried vainly to open the door. Jane laughed\n\" I should have warned you- this is my patent man-trap\". But she opened the doer for me and I escaped - reluctantly. C.M. H. Prof. Levy spoke at- 'Pub Parliament' held last week at St. Pauls Tavern, E.C. I. His subject was ' Is Science in Danger'\nand said that there was great interest and a lively discussion. \"There was a smack of the continental atmosphere -whole families were there, everything very informal and\nfriendly. \"As I spoke I was plied with beer rather too much\nin fact t\" Pub Parliament is organised by Finsbury Public Libraries. Fr of. Levy was enthusiastic about it and felt that the pub\nhad an important part too lay in integrating the life of\nsmall communities by providing a focal point for the exchange\nof ideas. "

C.are taking up the royal and\nancient game of golf. I would just like to give you a brief cross section of the I.C. Golf Association types. First we have the experts. These are few and far between but those we do have in captivity are ridiculous people who never make mistakes. They arrive back at the club house having gone round in about 70 strokes without losing a single ball. They drive prodigious distances and then let it slip out quite casually that they were driving with a short shafted spoon.\nWe have another type of member who hits the ball along way the direction often leaving something to be\ndesired. The eighth hole at Ful well is along hole into the prevailing wind and parallel to the main road on the right. So far, I.C. has a bag of two buses, one lorry, one window\nand two television aerials.( We also got an engine driver at the first hole). The local inhabitants now put up shutters when a certain member is seen on the tee. Should they fail to notice him, they soon discover his presence when they\nhear as wishing noise followed by a crash in the neighbourhood\nof their green-house. They take this as an immediate signal to cover as they know from experience that the player is second\ndrive will be along shortly. It is a very simple matter to pick out the Civil engineers and Miners among us. They lose no opportunity of practising their profession as they go round the course.
