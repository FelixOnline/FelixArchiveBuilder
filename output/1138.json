The event\ntook place in Birmingham, Solihull (sic)\nand lasted three days.\nThe Imperial Snooker A and B teams were largely different to last year's squad.\nJon Fulcher and Richard Turton remained\nIn the A team, with Jon expecting to win the A team singles championship this\nyear after coming close on several occasions in past years. The rest of the A team consisted of several players from last year'sB team which reached the semi-finals. The B team saw some fresh\nfaces, but the expectations of reaching the latter stages were still high.\nA team singles: Richard Tur ton reached the quarter finals only to meet After a nervous week with much anxiety\nat being the first club to drive FLEB after\nit crashed, our worst fears about the minibus were confirmed: the stereo did indeed still not work. However, there\nwas only one worrying moment on this\ntrip when I got my seat belt trapped in the\ndoor and thought I'd Jammed it, but it\nwas OK after a bit of heaving and push ing with Simon( ooh er). After an epic\njourney, we finally made it to the Jesse\nJames bunkhouse, in Snowdonia, at\nabout 1am. Saturday dawned bright(ish), and considerably earlier than some people thought desirable. But we had to get\ngoing and get up those mountains. So\nwithout further ado, the hardcore n utters were unleashed on the Glyders ridge.\nThe rest of us set off at a more sedate\npace up the Llanberis Path/Motorway to Snowdon, that is after we'd found it.\nThe surrounding peaks looked imp res sive, but as we neared the summit, temperatures plunged and we were shrouded In mist. There were also one or two patches of snow around. Steve\nreminded us of the all-pervasive ness of modern technology by giving a running commentary to his sister over his mobile phone. Makes a change from' I' mona train', I suppose. Our perseverance was rewarded with a very fine view, so magnificent\nthat everyone was clam our ing to take\nJon Fulcher, who eventually one the singles 3-2 against Rob Pugh. He should have won in comfortably when20 up\nand30 points ahead in the third frame,\nbut his desire for a cold pint almost\nmade him the nearly man yet again.\nB team singles: All players disappointingly were knocked out in the seco nd round. A team group: Reached the quarter\nfinals, when Queen's of Belfast knocked\nthem out\nB team group: Unluckily knocked out in semi-finals by Queen's who we earlier drew with 5-5.\nThe team showoff their winnings FELLWALKING\nphotos of it. You could see bugger all\nlandscape, but my bare legs were proudly on display, attracting a huge amount of attention. Nothing unusual\nthere, except by this stage they had accumulated a thick coating of ice. Lunch\nwas eaten on the way down the other\nside, with views of Glaslyn and Llyn Llydaw. On the descent, we were reunited\nwith the hardcore n utters, who were desperately trying to keep up with Tim\n'Incredibly Fast But Slim' who had the map. Evidently one lot of1000 m peaks\nwas not enough to keep them amused for a whole day, and they had to go up\nSnowdon as well. Once at the bottom,\nwe'd planned to take the interesting and remarkably straight path through the Llanberis Pass. But on discovering that\nit was in actual fact an electricity transmission line, and our tightrope-walking\nskills were not really up to scratch, we decided to take the road instead.\nAfter a quick half in a typically friendly\nWelsh pub, it was back to the bunk house\nto wait for then utters. Once again, we drew on our culinary talents (cheers,\nRichard) to produce a top quality spag bol, which was enjoyed by everyone except Peter 'Chips with Everything' Rose.\nAfter the meal, we settled down for an excruciating evening of pain and exe r tion, both physical and mental (you had to be to take part in some of Mat's party\ngames). ' Who amI?' was the question\nUCLI 1\nICI 2\n(a et) Following the nine-goal demolition of the R SMa week earlier, confidence was high going into the first of three crucial\nmatches against UCL.\nTo say that things weren't going our\nway would be a huge understatement as\nthe referee kept allowing UCL to kick\nlumps out of most of our players. When the referee finally blew for a foul It was to give UCL a penalty after Chris had cunningly let the forward into the area, and THEN brought him down. However, the\ndeadlock was not broken as Eric saved\nthe penalty brilliantly.\nAfter about half an hour of continuous battering, Alex finally snapped and decided to take the law Into his own hands by flooring a UCL defender with\na right backhand on the turn which any boxer would have been proud of. Again\nthe ref blew for a foul and sent Alex off the field.\nDespite being a man down, IC still\nlooked the better side and were never\non everyone's lips, particularly those\nwho had done the18 mile, 2,000m ascent in Tim's wake. Saturday's exertions\ncalled for a more gentle endurance test\non Sunday, so we headed for Moe lW ni on. The weather was a but rougher,\nwith hail showers, but we still did a good walk and had views of the sea. Unfortunately, a large detour in an attempt to find a decent place to cross a fast-flow-ing river meant that we did not have time\nto visit Colwyn Bay on the way home. So then it was straight back in the minibus and back to London along my 'clever new route' which led us straight\ninto aten mile tail back on the M6.We finally arrived in London not long before\nmidnight, but the journeys were well\nworth it: definitely one of the better trips.\nJames Clarke\nja.clarke@ic.ac.uk\nunder threat and were unlucky not to\ntake the lead through Amo who had a couple of shots blocked. In the second half things went from\nbad to worse as UCL scored directly off\na corner, extremely embarrassing for Eric\nwho was clearly confused by the wind( either that or he just bugger ed things\nup). With 20 mins to go IC equalise d after a stunning move that was finished\nby So-so.\nIC were now clearly on top and were\neven getting one or two decisions from\nthe referee, and in the first half of extra\ntime, went ahead thanks to a deadly\nstrike from \"Dirty\" Warren after playing a nice one-two with Till. The second half j was a different story as UCL threw every- ;\nthing they could at us but the solid back\nfour of Rich, So-so, Chris and Phil refused ;\nto break down as we held out for a victory that sent the\" fan\" wild. So IC have\nmade it through to the final for the sec- \u2022\non d year running, hopefully we will of one better this year and win the cup.

    "content": "10 Arts 1 March 1999\nTHE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA\nRose Bruford College at the ICA\nT he Playwright was dragged out of bed just before dawn. Fear and confusion hit him like a bomb blast\nin a crowded street. He was half-naked\nbut they insisted he go out into the yard behind the house; someone kicked\nhim hard. They stopped at a spot near\na big tree; the Playwright noticed one of them had a gun. They told the Playwright he could smoke a cigarette, but\nhis hands were shaking too badly to light it. Sometime later a five-year old girl\nfound the Playwright's body lying in a ditch. Her father said he remembered hearing a gunshot early one morning. The Playwright was Federico Garcia\nLorca, and this is how I imagine his\nmurder by Fascist soldiers. The murder took place a short time after he had finished writing the play The House of\nBernada Alba. The year was1936 and the Spanish Civil War was just beginning. Lorca is one of the finest writers of the20 th century and this production by drama students at the famous Rose Bruford College is one of the finest plays I have seen recently. The story documents the isolated and loveless experience of sisters trapped in a house by their oppressive and insensitive mother,\nBernada Alba. There are nomen in the play, yet the sisters have each fallen In\nlove with an almost mythical male fig-ure, Pepe el Romano, who they talk\nabout all the time since they see him as\ntheir only means of escape. In one sense, Ihe play is a damning indictment of the parochialism of rural\nand suffocating. The company succeed except for one slip. At the end of the second act, the family discover that vigilantes are about lo lynch a single mother. They respond by facing the audience and shouting 'Kill her!', which was laughably amateur.\nlife - Jean de Florette without Gerard\nDepardieu, if you like. But it is more than\njust historical reportage; it explores the isolation that everyone feels at times. A good interpretation needs to be intense\nThe entire cast gave good perform ances. In particular, 1 loren cia Cord eu convincingly played an old woman in\nthe demanding but vital role of Bernada\nAlba. Karin Ing hammer was excellent\nas Adela a persuasive portrayal is really\nneeded here because, as the youngest daughter, she embodies the last ray of hope. In one scene, Ing hammer a cci den tally tr ip p ed over a chair, but she recovered, making the incident look deliberate. This shows great confidence and although there must have been first-night nerves, all the actors displayed\na level of technical competence which marked them out as professionals. The\nonly other accident was a rope sudd en ly dropping from the flies: it looked like a noose. Heavy with symbolism per-hap s, but I don't think it was intended! You've missed the chance to catch\nthis show, but the company are putting\non a season of popular plays at the ICA\n(Institute of Contemporary Arts). If this\nfirst performance is anything to go by,\nthe others are well worth seeing. Remember, we're talking Rose Bruford\nCollege( up there with RADA) which means you could see actors who become the next Kate Winslet or Ralph\nFiennes. And you saw them first, which is definitely worth \u00a34 of anyone' s money. William Burns\nTOAST\nRoyal Court Theatre Upstairs\nS et in a Yorkshire bread factory in the1970 s, Toast is essentially an examination of the different ways in\nwhich people cope with monotony and boredom. Indeed, the factory staff room during the Sunday night shift may not\nseem the most exciting of locations for\na play, but you will find yourself captivated and reluctant to leave.\nWith no plot as such, the charm lies\nin the extraordinary and fascinating char-act ers, and with an excellent cast to play\nthem, the personalities of all seven are\nbrought out brilliantly. Mark Williams ( ted Dwarf, The Fast Show) and Sam Kelly\n(Coronation Street) ate two of the better\nknown ones, but on board are also two proficient Shakespeare actors and some very experienced theatre stars.\nEach of them has a different way of getting through the12 hour shifts -there's the realist, the optimist, the dimwit, the hard worker, the escapist, the\nself important one and the lunatic.\nThroughout the course of the play they\nreveal their idiosyncrasies, motivations\nand details about their outside lives.\nThe play is written by stand-up come dian Richard Bean who has actually\nworked in the bread industry and the director, Richard Wilson (One Foot in the\nCrave) ensures that none of the humour is lost. There are some very funny scenes,\ndoes this by making their humdrum lives\nappear more convincing and it really\ndoes feel weird to be so enthralled by the\nmonotony of their lives.\nand in fact relieved that in the end nothing has changed. The plant is faced with\nclosure and the workers are forced to\nconfront their real feelings about their\njobs. This illustrates the characters' feelings of being trapped, and their lack of\ncontrol over their own lives. Yet we are\nalso shown their strange reluctance to\nleave it, and to keep everything how it\nhas always been. Another recurring theme in the play\nis identity, and how to define yourself\nwhen you have no specific role in life but\ntinning bread. Again, we are shown how each of the characters copes with their\nanonymity and we leave with a real feeling of knowing and understanding each\nof them. You'll want to be back to see what\nhappens in the next shift.\nJudy\nUntil 6th March Nearest Tube: Leicester Square\nTickets: \u00a35 concessions, standing 10p Performance times: Monday Saturday\n7 pm and Bean's obvious insider knowledge A staggering turn of events adds a adds an element of authenticity that hint of promise on the storyline front, but\nsomehow seems to make the play all the when nothing comes of this you will\nmore entrancing. It is strange in that it find yourself surprisingly un disappointed "

What follows are extracts from the letter he sent us. Felix would like to state that our sources for the article printed\nlast week were reliable. However, at the time of going to press we were unable to\nverify the exact truth of the matter. We hope to resolve the issue one way or the other next week.\nProfessor Malcom Green: \"Your front page article on the future\nof St Mary's Campus is an astonishing\nmixture of inaccuracy and fabrication.\nThe facts, as any of us would have willingly confirmed, are these.\nIn the summer and early autumn of last year many of the scientists with their\nresearch and teaching groups moved from\nthe St Mary's Campus building to the new BMS building at South Kensington. Teaching continues on the site, but some of the\nteaching activities have transferred. The By the News Team\nresult is that there are large tracts of the\nbuilding which are vacant, and not up to\nmodern standards for research and teach-ing. It would be tragic to see the building\nremain in this condition, and degenerate\ninto sparsely occupied old age.\nThe problem was recognised some time ago and we applied to the University\nfunding Council (HEFCE) and were successful in obtaining funds to refurbish part\nof the 4th floor for modern laboratories,\nfor virology research. Work on this will\nstart soon. Conversion of buildings is expensive.\nNo substantial capital monies were available within IC following completion of the\nBMS building. Fortunately, however, in\nthe summer of1998 the Government announced a \u00a3600M fund to be competed for nationally to help refurbish the\ninfrastructure of UK Universities. 5 0 % of\nthis money came from central Government, and50% from the Wellcome Trust,\nan independent medical charity. It is possible that this is where the confusion with\nGlaxoWellcome came In, although there\nis now no association between the pharmaceutical firm and the Wellcome Trust,\nwhich is an independent charity. A bid for\nup to \u00a326M was put in by Imperial College\non behalf of the St. Mary's building in\nDecember to this Joint Infrastructure Fund\n(JIF). If the full money is granted, it should\nallow complete refurbishment of the build-ing, with new state of the art research and teaching facilities. Of course it is possible\nthat the bid will not succeed, or that a lesser sum will be allocated in which case\nthere will need to be partial solutions.\nIf JIF funds were awarded, detailed\nplanning would need to take place.

    "content": "24 Games 1 March 1999\nAlpha Centaur! (PC)\nFiraxis\nAll we are saying Is give war a chance\nThere are a few games developers whose names have become synonymous with high quality, lovingly created\nproducts. David Bra ben, the Bitmap Brothers, John Romero all these people have been spoken of as games vision-aries; people who have such creative\nability that any new product from them is awaited with baited breath. The god father of them all, however, is Sid Meier. Sid Meier has been devising and producing games since the mid-eighties,\ncreating several near-classics in the course of his career. But the game he will be remembered for is a little thing by\nthe name of Civilisation (1990), and its\nsequel Civilisation 2 (1995).\nCivilisation is a brilliantly simple concept. You start out as the leader of an insignificant tribe of nomads, and your\ngoal is become the supreme ruler of earth by conquering the other tribes.\nHowever, in order to gain supremacy,\nyou need to research new technologies and build\narmies using those new technologies.\nthe and the\nyou to\nTerraform the planet Into a nice green mass, and avoid creating a Milton Keynes mess\nTo do research\nbuild\narmies\nneed develop your\neconomy. As you build your\neconomy and do your research, new methods of government become available. Civilisation is a game of juggling, balancing the needs of your\npeople against the needs of your military\nagainst the needs of your economy. As\nyour empire grows (assuming that it does\ngrow) you have to deal with barbarian\nuprisings, unrest and occasionally revolt\nin your cities, and of course the ever-pre-sent threats of neighbouring empires.\nAny games player worth their salt will\nbe familiar with Civilisation (colloquially\nknown as Civ), and the vast majority will\nhave tales of days and nights lost to its\nthrall. Many of those will\nalmost literally worship the game1 know for a fact that\nour beloved Games Editor\nkeeps his copy on a velvet\ncushion in a gold cabinet\nencrusted with fine jewels.\nCivilisation2 (likewise known as Civ2), which was an updated version of the game more technologies,\nbetter units, better graphics\nand a couple of useful utilities allowing people to develop their own scenarios - became the first game to usurp the original from its perch at the very top of the gaming tree. Next time you hookup to the web, do a search for websites devoted to Civ2\n- you will find thousands, which is a tribute to quite how good a game it is.\nNow Sid Meier has produced Alpha Centauri, Civilisation 3 in all but name( the reason for the name change is long\nand boring, but if anyone's really interested buy me a pint next time you catch\nme in the Union bar and I 'll tell you). At\nthe end of Civ (and Civ2) your empire built a vast interplanetary spacecraft, and sent a band of voyagers across space to\ncolonize the stars. Alpha Centauri picks\nup the story there. During the voyage your colonists split up into seven individual factions. These factions adopted their own ideologies and upon arrival at\nthe planet set up their own encampments. The race for planetary dom in ation begins.\nAnyo ne who has played\nthe Civ\ngames will\nknow what\nto expect\nnext. In\nfact anyone\nwho' s played the Civ games will have\nstopped\nreading\nlong ago and will by\nnow be hunched over a flickering screen,\nfor those of you left out there in Felixland, your job is to develop your faction\nand gain superiority over the other lead-ers. As before this is done through research, construction and trade.\n\" Hang on a sec\" I hear you cry \"why\nshould Igo and spend my hard-earned\non another copy of essentially the same game? I could just go off to my jewel-encrusted casket and play Civ2 again.\"\nWell, here's the rub. The only real negative about both Civ and Civ2 was that\nLie, makepeace then send In the troops. Definitely not the best way to make friends and influence people ultimately you had to go out and conquer\nyour enemies. You couldn't just live in\npeace and harmony with them as a big happy global family - you had to go out\nand hit them over the head with a stick\nuntil they agreed to be part of your empire. Alpha Centauri changes that,\nand that change opens up the course of the whole game. There are now four\npaths to\nvictory:\nconquest,\ndiplomacy,\neconomic superiority\nand trans ce nden cy( the evolution to a new level\nof conscious ness). It is\nnow theoretically possible\n(although\nstill bloody hard) for the faction with the smallest, weakest empire to win the game. That means that, rather than concentrating on research with military applications (generally it became a rush to see\nwho could develop tanks first), the research you undertake depends on the goal you are pursuing. This change inflates your options to a staggering, in\nfact almost frightening degree. I'm no mean player of Civ myself - seasoned would be an understatement - but there\nhave been several times over the past\nfew days when I have had to seriously\nstep back from the game and wonder just how I'm going to get to where I want\nto go the range of different options is\nquite stunning.\nThere is one other major gameplay advance that separates Alpha Centauri\nfrom Civ and Civ2. The different factions now all behave in recognisably different manners. The militaristic Spartans\nare all threats and bluster,\nand keep wanting to go out\nand bash people over the head. The diplomatic UN want to be nice to every-one and gain their trust.\nThe Gaians believe in living\nIn concert with the natural\nprocesses of the planet.\nThese different manners drastically affect the way that these factions react to\nyou, and consequently the\nway that you react to them. Suggest to the Gaians that\na useful alliance can be\nmade with the Morgan ites( the big business faction),\nand they'll look at you horrified, and quite probably refuse to talk to you for along time afterwards. The Believers (religious fundamentalists) don't like the intellectual challenges of the University\nfaction (umm... quite good at research,\nwould you believe), and start to look all\nsquiggly-eyed at them and their allies.\nBasically these two major changes\nperfect the concepts originally\nlaid down in\nCiv. The other\ntweaks( vastly\nimproved graphics and sound, the ability to design your own units,\nmultiplayer\ngames over a network and so\non) are cosmetic - imp or tant yes, but\nultimately cos-metic. By freeing the gameplay of the single goal and introducing significant differences in the computer Al, Sid Meier and his team have made a genuinely essential game for any gamer. This game is the best one I have ever played, and it's hard to see anything coming along for along long\ntime which will give it anything more than a moderate jog for its money. Forget the thesis, forget the world\noutside, forget sleep. Buy this game. It's that simple.\nDanny\nNo honestly if you want to keep sane and get a decent nights sleep over\nthe next month, year or even decade dont buy this game. People will see your\ndeep sunken eyes and white monitor\nbleached skin and will rightly assume you need medical attention...remember\nAlpha Centuri screws you up...\nCaryS\n....... .\n:\nHovertanks definitely don't suck..\nWell, OK, perhaps the air Intake does.\n\n"

    "content": "1 March 1999 Arts 11\nBLOOD WEDDING\nUnion Concert Hall\nT he first production by the newly merged ICSM Drama Society was Federico Garcia Lorca's Blood Wedding, performed on17,19 and20 February.\nThe play is set in 1920s rural Spain,\nand tells the true story of an ill-fated\nwedding. The bride, daughter of a wealthy hemp farmer, is still in love with\nLeonardo( incident ly the only named character), who is now married with a child. Leonardo' s family has been involved in a feud with the bridegroom's family, in which the groom's father and brother have been killed, leaving his\nmother nervous and protective of him. Still with me? Good. Straight after the wedding, the bride runs away with Leonardo and the groom chases them. He catches the fugitives after a moonlit\npursuit through the forest, and both he and Leonardo are killed in the ensuing fight.\nAlthough the plot is actually fairly\nstraightforward, Blood Wedding is heavy\non symbolism and meaning. The script is\nquite stylised, with much repetition of phrases and ritualism. Lorca wrote it in\nthe style of a Greek tragedy; forces beyond the characters' control take over\ntheir actions. In this case the main themes are love and family - the blood of the title refers to feuds and heredity\nas much as it does to the murders.\nThe strongest characters in the play\nare the women,- the bride, the groom's mother and Leonardo's wife. They are\nleft to cope after the deaths, and come aided by dazzling lighting effects and well-chosen excerpts of classical music.\nThe dramatic effects were impressive,\nalthough it was occasionally difficult to\nfollow the action (trying to take photos\nat the same time probably didn't help,\nthough). Congratulations are due to director Rosic Bcal-Prcston, and her assistant Ranti Atijosan for an impressive per-form ance. We can only look forward to\ntheir next production. Garclh\nthrough with dignity.\nDespite the complex and at times\nstrained script, the production was extremely good. The cast turned in great\nperformances throughout in particular,\nFarah R ch man was excellent as the mother of the groom. The sets,\nmakeup and costumes were also very well done, giving the whole performance a distinctly\nSpanish feel. There was a real\nintensity lot he later scenes, HARRODS INTERNATIONAL PIANO SERIES\nRoyal Festival Hall\nT his year is the tenth anniversary of the annual international piano series on the SouthBank. The Royal Festival Hall has invited the stars for the occasion. Daniel Barenboim, one of the i world's most loved pianists, performed on7 February. The hall was absolutely full, even with extra seats added onstage near the magni fi cent piano. I was lucky enough to be! sitting rather high up in the balcony. The view was simply stunning, with the people surrounding the performer and his instrument. Barenboim' s programme was a treat. Fie started off with two sonatas by Beethoven, both quite famous and lovely pieces of music. His inter pr eta tion was perfect and tremendously expressive. After a well deserved interval, he returned to play Debussy' s first book of Preludes, one of my favourite creations by any composer. It was sim ply breathtaking. He performed the pieces with astounding ease and virtuosity, bringing out the simplicity and splendid musicality of Debussy' s work. The audience showed its appreciation and begged for an encore. Barenboim was very generous and came back onstage more than once, playing a beautiful Nocturne by Chopin, another personal favourite. His performance was very refreshing and a great reminder of his undoubted talent( this was his first\nappearance in Britain since the end of the80 s). His career has spanned over40 years and he is still at the height of his powers. On21 February, another well respected pian is l was onstage at\nthe Royal Festival Hall, the Russian Mikhail P let nev. His recital was yet another stab at perfection. I he only problem was that he made a last\nminute change in his programme, replacing some pieces by Bach for Rachmaninoff, which caused much distress, lo some members of I he audience. In the end though, they were toned to admire the pianist's talent,\ntie also performed some Lyric Pieces\nby Gti cg thai were highly poetic and amusing. At this point, P let nev won the heart of his spectators. I lis inter-preta tion was spotless. His faultless sense of feeling and expression were inspiring he; seemed to live\nwhat he was playing. I have; rarely\nseen such deep involvement in a performer. As did Barenboim, P let nev came back for a few encores. He also played one of Chopin' s Nocturnes to\nthe audience's delight and finished off with a hilarious and touching rendition of The Musical Box.\nBoth concerts were marvellous a rare experience to witness genuinely enchanting performances. this distinguished series of concerts alI he Royal Festival Hall continues throughout the Spring with other wonderful in ler national pianists coming to London. Artists\ninclude; Imogen Cooper, Maurizio Poll on i and Alfred Br end cl unmissable cont or is for anyone who enjoys moment sol pure magic. D. "

I did-n't believe him at first, but then he revealed that Urban Legend is so-called\nbecause the unfortunate college students at the centre of its macabre plot\nmeet their untimely ends in the manner of those contemporary folk tales which have mysteriously entered our collective\nconsciousness. Now I was interested.\nAfter all, everyone has heard of the\nbabysitter who receives phone calls threatening the children in her care and then\ndiscovers that they are originating in the\nupstairs bedroom, and what about the numerous unpleasant stories of food con-tami nation? Who' s to say which rat-found-in-burger variants are actually true and which are the result of a fertile imagination and a desire to discredit a fast food conglomerate? It sounded like the perfect\nFor God's sake; LOOK BEHIND YOU.\npremise for a self-reverential horror film in\nthe vein of Scream, with the bonus that,\nsince urban mythology is almost un iver sal, you don't have to be a die hard devotee of slasher films to enjoy the ironic\nhumour. The whole thing was beginning to\nsound extremely plausible, and I was finally convinced when someone else\ndescribed exactly the same film lo me, adding that the cast features Alicia Witt\n(Zoey in TV's CybilD, Rebecca Gayheart\n{Scream 2), Jared Leto (My So-Called Life)\nand Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek).\nApparently, there is even a cameo from Nightmare on Elm Streets Freddie,\nRobert Englund. This blok e reckoned that\nit is hugely entertaining stuff, provided\nthat you suspend your disbelief to an almost reckless extent and are willing to\noverlook some frighteningly bad acting.\nSomehow performing the feat of being\ncleverly executed and downright daft at\nthe same time, he claimed Urban Legend\nmakes ideal viewing for those who don't take being scared too seriously. Great, I thought, and began looking forward to a trip to the cinema that was until he told\nme what he found in his popcorn, fl\nSimon\nWin tickets to You've Got Mail with the\nKENSINGTON\nThe reunion of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan,\nstars of smash-hit Sleepless In Seattle,\nwas only a matter of time.

Yet just a few months later\nit has become one of the most successful British movies of all time, and remake rights have recently been sold\nto Tom Cruise, who plans to star and direct the US version.\nEven all this success can't allay those\ninitial doubts over the cast - V in nic Jones looks good, largely because noo ne else can act. Fortunately, however,\nthat doesn't matter, as the script, and more importantly the plotting, are phe-nomen ally good. If you haven't seen it\nalready, this is a definite must see. The Castle\nWe automatically expect Australian TV to\nbe awful, yet naturally assume their\nmovies will be brilliant. Make sense of that.

Give It up you\nwusses.\n(a) A thinker\n(b)A dreamer\n(c)A romantic.\nIf you are not any of these things\nthen I can assure you that you wont like\nthis album. If on the, other hand you are, then read on. With the genius of Martin Rossiter\nat the helmand a truly fantastic band\nbehind him, you can be sure that a Gene album will never disappoint. Comparisons made in the past about the similarities in singing styles of Rossiter and Morrisey could still be made here but\nthere is one crucial difference...Gene do\nIt better, a lot better.\nEach track gives the listener a tiny\nglimpse into the mind of Rossiter. He sings with a phenomenal amount of passion which is, in my opinion, always a bit\nof a novelty and something often lacking\nin the many of today's bands. The problem that arises from the complexity of an\nintelligent album like Revelations is that\nyou cannot expect to pick it up, listen to\nit once and love it immediately. This is an\nalbum that needs just that little bit more time to get into, but when you doI can\nguarantee it'll be worth the effort. You'll\nfind yourself returning to it again and again...you could never get bored of it.\nTracks 3 and13 Love Won't Work\nand You'll Never Walk Again arc classic\nexamples of what Gene do best. With\nlyrics like' Is it too late to find someone? I lie in wait to be undone by anyone' sung with the feeling and emotion that\nRossiter is able to convey become truly\nsoul-touching stuff\nThere is a lack of any tracks about confused sexuality of the sort that could be found on Gene's massive debut album Olympian. They seem to be a more mature band and are now comfortable with subjects like this yet still\nnever disappoint in the sexy song depart-ment. In their previous album Drawn\nInto The Deep End this came in the form of New Amusements. Here, The Looker\nis the glimpse into Rossiters darker, most\nlustful side.\nMost of the tracks are punchy with\nthe odd heart wrenching number tucked\nIn between. All contain something extra\nto make them stand out from the rest.\nThe overall style of the album is more akin to Olympian than Drawn In to The\nDeep End. The best two tracks, You'll\nNever Walk Again and Love Won't Work,\nare made great by Rossiters amazing vocals but would be nothing without the\ntalent of the rest of the band in the rear.\nThe album is multipurpose in the sense that, of the13 tracks available,\nyou always seem to be able to find one to fit the mood you are in. It is released\non through Polydor on March1 st,and the first single from it As Good As It\nGets, produced by Hugh Jones, was released on the 15th of this month. Their\ntour begins Sunday 21 st February at Cam bridge Junction and ends March25 th at\nthe to rum, fond on( support t bc).E] Dennis\nSingles\nSheryl Crow - Anything But Down\nIncluding two live acoustic tracks, which is what Ms. Crow excels at, this is what we' ve come to expect and there's nothing new here. With a mellow guitar, Co un try drums and the safe, \"I think it's all over now love,\nso bugger off\" lyrics she pulls no punches. It's bound to shift units by the bucket load.\nEve 6 - Leech\nWhat is it with acoustic sets this week? Arguably the best\nsong on this single is Inside Out and not Leech, which is in itself a fantastically trashy pop song in the Everclear\nvein. It's got a really Infectious chorus coupled with a soft verse and you can't help singing to it. But will it be a hit? 'Course not, we' ve got Steps.\nThe Junket - You're The Same\nAn incredibly ear-friendly hook paves the way for two high-energy, funky rock songs. The music is tight, and the vocals make no bones about having an English\ntwang. The only thing that lets this down is that it'son vinyl. I mean, live in the now, get aCD because I hate\nhaving to traipse about hunting for a record player.\nKent - 747\nNot impressed. Only one song, and though that would be forgivable if it was particularly fine, it's not. Kent are\nthe whine y bits of James and any other \"Indie\" (my, how that word grates) band you come to think of. As soon as 747 starts to get going, it finishes. What's all that\nabout then?\nESSENTIAL CHOON Inch feat. Mark E. Smith - Inch\nValue for money or what! Five whole tracks seem loads\n'til you notice they're all mixes of the same song. Is\nthere such a thing as industrial-big beat mc tal? Can someone invent it please? The beat's the centre piece here and it certainly hits you, along with a raw bass and the mandatory twi ddl y synth. Purposeful.\nMonster Magnet - Space Lord\nMultimedia-ta stic! There's a Puff Daddy/ Aerosmithesque video on this that is totally cheesy, I love it! Space\nLord is similar to all of Monster Magnet's previous\nstuff, what with their 7 0 s influences, big cars and lay-deez but who cares. It's self-indulgent, loud and a breath of fresh air from what's around at the moment. Solvent - Let Me Go\nI should like it in principle because it sounds like they're\nsupposed to be Reef-ish but c it her the production was crap or the band are. The guitars sound like they're\nbeing played through pillows, the drums are actually biscuit tins and you can just tell the singer's jiggling about\nthe studio. Look boys; don't give up your day jobs. This\nis your day job? Shame. The Supernaturals - Everest\nAnother one with one track. When will the madness end? This is a ballad of the highest proportions (ged-dit? Everest. I'm wasted here, I really am) and it's quite\nenjoyable. There arc some lovely harmonious vocals\nand the lyrics are touchingly normal whilst clever. It's still not a patch on Day Before Yesterday's Man though. ra\nChristian\n\n"

IC was entering two teams, Oxford five, and Cambridge eight.\nOriginally planned as a dry race, circumstances changed as 30 minutes before the green flag, it pissed it down! There was no time to re-prepare the\nkarts, and no way to chicken out. There\nwas no two ways about it - this was going to be FUN!!!!\nUnder floodlights, the Oxford and Cambridge1 st teams made the early\npace, but soon, the sublime driving from\nPhil, Nat and Dan put IC 2nd's into a lead\nthey would not relinquish. IC Ist's( the\nnumbers meant nothing it was just a case of who signed on first), led by Ben,\nwith Oli, Matt, and yours truly, under his\nexpert guidance, got off to a good start\nmoving into 3rd place. A glorious Imperial 1-2 was on the cards when disaster\nstruck!! One of the Ist's engines went the way of Michael Schumacher at Spa,\nand completely lost it!! Being twine ng in e karts, we managed to limp back\nto the pits, but a15 minute stop while\nthey changed the engine blew any\nchance of a decent finish.\nThrough atrocious conditions, some sensible yet committed driving by IC 1st dragged the team back up the order to\n7th place at the 2-hr time limit. Nobody, however, could touch the 2nd's who finished three laps ahead of the Oxford1 st team. Their win was underlined by\ntaking the fastest lap - Vi a second quicker than IC Ist's who were second-fastest.\nSo! It's official! IC are way ahead of\nOxbridge when it comes to the important things in life!\nFor more information about the IC karting club, contact ph m@ ic.ac.uk, or\nba f1@ ic.ac.uk\nPaul Brady\nLADIES RUGBY\nIC Virgins 73 -5 Kings\nThe Virgins scored big time. From the\nmoment we took the odd shaped ball in\nour hands our excitement grew and grew. The King's players came on hard\nfor the first two minutes but they were premature and we took them and scored. Our subs were giving it some oral on the sidelines and King's kept ongoing down, down, down. We penetrated their defence time and time again,\nuntil they could take no more. Their tackles were more playful than\nhard so we showed them how it was\ndone. Our hookers gave them a run for\ntheir money. We came out of every ruc k and maul on top in, and our studs dug in deep as our furry mascot screamed for\nmore. Shouts of give it in, get your kit\noff, drive, show it to me, and yes, yes,\nyes where regularly heard from the pitch.\nPerv's underwear was on the pitch, Alison didn't have the horn and flasher did-n't pull her usual trick.\nLADIES HOCKEY\nIC 8 - 0 Royal Vets\nAfter starting with only 10 players (cheers\nScully) we had a storm in' match.\nCamped in their 25 for the entire match,\nwe spent the first half occasionally giving the keeper the ball. Wifey managed to clear up off the pads twice,\nleaving it 2-0 at half time.\nAfter sharp words from Bagpuss, the\n2nd half was taken at a difference pace.\nShots were pummelled at the keeper\nleft, right and centre and the odd few went in. Scully after her late arrival\nscored her first goal since her wise defection from RS M( that'll be a jug),\nHumming Bird put in a couple( jug\navoidance? - I don't think so I) and Wifey completed her near double hattrick finishing in fire.\n8-0! it serves you Vet sight for spending all your time with your hands up cows\nbottoms.\nULTIMATE FRISBEE\nIC 19 - 6 Southampton\nAfter a sedate opening match against\nPortsmouth Uni, IC Ultimate team were anticipating a real head-to-head against\nthe South East champions Southampton\nUni (Skunks). With an incomplete squad,\nincluding only one sub, the odds were in IC's favour from the offset.\nA much improved team perform ance and a spirited individual display\nfrom John \" on your knees\" Taylor (who\ncaught over 1/2 IC's points), IC walked\naway with a convincing victory. A replay\nat the National Student Indoor finals in\n10 days time may yield a different out-come!

    "content": "Letters & Small Ads 1 March 1999\nMore on Bike Theft Mary's Merger Welcome?\nDear Felix,\nI write in response to Neil Forsyth's letter\npublished in the last issue.\nA couple of years ago, I used to cycle\nto and from College everyday. Within the\nfirst two months of commuting by bike, I had had TWO bikes stolen. The first time I had parked it at the racks just outside the\nElec Eng main entrance, and the security\ncameras were too far away to pick up any\nuseful footage. So when I got my second\nbike I made sure I parked it right in front of\nthe two cameras outside RSM. When this\nsecond bike got stolen, the security camera\npicked up all the action, but because the\ninfrared lights on the cameras were off-line,\nonly the silhouette of the thief could be seen, and no identification could be made.\nGiven this kind of situation. Security\ncould hardly make any claims on the effectiveness of the cameras. My objection is that\nthey should at least make sure that the cameras are in perfect working condition at ALL\ntimes. My advice to anyone who needs to\nlock their bike on campus: don't use a brand-new bike (and if you want to use one,\ngive it a good bashing first so it looks worn\nout!), and take the saddle off when you\nleave your bike.\nCarol Lo\nElec Eng 4\nDear Felix\nOn Thursday the 18th of February, my mountain bike was stolen from in front of\nthe BMS building where it was double locked to the green side of the standing\nfence with aD lock and a kryptonite cable\nlock. The event took place sometime between 10am and 3pm, in broad daylight and in an area where people are constantly walking by.\nMy bike was brand new1 had it for\nunder two weeks, since this was a replacement bike for one that was stolen in early\nin November. As Iam not allowed to bring\na bike into the BMS building, I ha ve no choice but to keep it locked outside. I think\nit is ridiculous that anyone who cycles Into\ncollege every day should have to ride in a severely dilapidated bike to discourage its\ntheft because the college has no concern\nover the property of their students and staff.\nI would be interested to see the total estimated value of all of the bicycles reported\nstolen from the college per year and wo nder if this cost would be enough to stimulate a response from those in a position to\ntake action or is it just a complete lack of\ninterest from those who are unaffected?\nIn any event, the least the college\nshould do is make all staff and students\naware of the thefts and encourage people\nto look for and report any witnessed events\nthat could help catch or deter the thieves.\nTerrie Sadusky-McCaul\nTeddington to property developers, the\nmedical school to a multinational. What's next? Arc the students at Mary's to be leased out to film companies as extras? Has\nIC gone money mad? The promises made by IC that the second year medics would-n't be adversely affected by the merger\nhave proved false. By selling the med school IC will take away their home and\nprobably ruin their medical school experience. What we are seeing now resembles\nan aggressive takeover with Mary's being\nbroken up and sold to the highest bidder.\nTheir minds don't appear to be on the\nimportant issue-the student. And who are\nthese money men who control the path of\nImperial? I have a vision of Dr. Evil sitting in\nhis large black leather chair plotting world\ndomination and if anyone disagrees his, finger reaches for the red button under the\ntable.\nApparently, the discussions with GlaxoWellcome about the sale of the med school\nhave been going on for some months.\nThis sort of issue only ever comes to the\nattention of the student when it is leaked.\nIs the information being with-hcl d purposefully until everything is signed, sealed\nand any student protest would be in vain?\nIn fact - is Imperial being run by Tony Blair?\nSteven Grant\nBiochem II\nNice one, RSM\nTo everyone involved in Cambourne vs\nRSM:\nA couple of points::\ni) Congratulations on a fantastic victory\nover Cambourne. Long live tradition and\nbeer fights in the Union Bar.\nii) Apologies to everyone travelling to\nHarlington for the matches against Cambourne. Due to an honest administrative\nerror some problems were experienced\nwith the coaches. Hopefully by the time that\nFelix goes to print the post-event problems\nwill have been resolved and we can live in\npeace and harmony once more.\niii) If anyone was offended by the\nabsence of the DP(C&S) at'the matches\nthen I must apologise. I had every intention\nof being there to cheer RSM on but navigating the womens minibus until 4:30am on Saturday morning unfortunately got the\nbetter of me. Just thought I'd let you know...\nMarie Nicholaou\nSummer Ball Bookings\nDear Summer Ball Team,\nWe are looking to purchase approx. 40\ntickets for the Summer Ball for final year students in our department to say their final\nfarewell. Can we get a group discount?\nRegards\nFinal Year Students\nReply:\nDear Final Year Students,\nWe are unable to offer group dis-counts, but we will be offering champagne\nand other extras to the members of the\nlargest group booking we receive. Contact\nsummer.ball@ic.ac.uk for more details.\nRegards\nSummer Ball Team\nCryptic Cock-ups\nDear Felix,\nI write with reference to Gnat Chum's Cryptic Crossword. The crossword is normally\nexcellent, and provides a most stimulating\ndistraction during Monday's afternoon lec-ture s. However, I can't be alone in noticing\nthat the clues arc becoming increasingly riddled with typographical errors. A typo such\nas replacing a double '!' with a single T is\nconfusing, particularly in an an ogram at ical clue, and you should realy (sic) appreciate\nthis. Worse still, accepting the presence of\nmistakes will encourage the reader to question the accuracy of correctly presented\nclues.\nThe answers given the following week are often roughly accurate (1136: India for\nIndian and Parsonage for Parsonages). Furthermore, in 1136,1 was somewhat thrown\nby Gnat Chum's geography. Ihe clue \"Four\nteas with sugar in a trench town\" should\nperhaps read \"....in a German town\", unless\nthere exists a second Stuttgart about which\nIam unaware.\nYours etc.\nSam Jandwich\nPraise from Patrickson\nDear Felix\nI feel that I have a few things to say. Naturally, I'm disappointed at not being elected\nbut I congratulate Tasha on landing the\nPresidency. I'm sure the Union will be in\nsafe hands next year. The Presidential race\nbrought out a lot of g oo d points and strong\nviews that I hope will be followed up on -It would be a shame to waste all the ideas\nthat were generated.'\nVarious students have had words of commiseration for me today and some had harsh words to say about St. Mary's.I'd really appreciate it if this stopped. I think\nmembers of the Mary's campus are only\nprotecting their interests. All those that\nvoted on the South Ken campus can have\na slight gripe but for those that didn't, you\nhave nothing to complain about. I don't really want to use the term block vote but\nI will - it's not impossible for any group of\npeople tom obili sea block vote if they\nreally want to. I do not personally advocate\nIt (naturally) I'm just saying that any cam-pus/department is capable of doing it. Perhaps this is something that those who arc\nhere next year should think about it when the elections come round again. The point\nis though, that I don't wish the graphical representation of the votes to be just more fuel\nto the fire that fights integration.\nI'd like to end on a personal note. I thank ail those that contributed to my cam-pa ign, both emotionally and physically.\nThere were so many people that helped\nthat I can never really repay all of them. I was always told it was wrong to single any\none person out for praise as it belittles others efforts. However, I don't believe in that.\nThere was someone that sacrificed a lot of\ntime and effort, who faced the wind tunnel that is the walkway, who ended days\nsmelling like a mixture of a print unit and\na blu-tack factory and who gave me confidence and strength when I was over-run\nwith doubt. Pascalc-thank you.\nWell done and good luck to the Fab\nFive!\nDennis Patrickson\nClearer Air in the Union\nDear Felix,\nYour throat feels as though it's not felt the\ntouch of water for years, your eyes sting like\nhell and visibility is poor at the very best.\nAnd then there are your lungs....\nIam of course talking about the Union.\nThe WHOLE union. For when the union\nbecomes active, a choking, cloaking field\nof smoke descends upon its interior. Now I myself have nothing against smokers as\nindividuals, indeed I have some friends\nwho smoke. But collectively I hate 'ya you\nselfish bastards I The Union last Friday was full of smoke,\neverywhere. Previously I had had to leave\nSouthside at half-time during England v. France because I couldn't hack the smoke\nanymore (ok so maybe leaving at half-time\n\u2022 wasn't such a bad idea anyway). Iam not\nthe only non-smoker who has reservations\nover passive smoking. I hope Iam not the\nonly student who will speak out against it.\nI will not be forced to smoke - passively\nor otherwise. The air in London is bad\nenough as it is. Should people like myself\nbe Inclined to stay away from the union\nbecause of this?\nI'm not saying smoking should be banned - but designate some areas nonsmoking or at least get some decent air-con-d it ion ing in and prove to us that the union\nisn't run by a bunch of insensitive gripper s.

The vast majority of\nstudents (along with most other people renting from private landlords) will have an\n'assured short hold tenancy'.\nYou will normally be a tenant if you have\nexclusive occupation of at least one room,\nand your landlord/lady does not live in the\nsame property. A tenant has greater rights\nthan a licensee; most importantly, you cannot be evicted without a court order (and,\nhence, a proper reason).\nLicense agreements, though they offer less\nprotection, are not necessarily a problem.\nHowever, because you might be living in your\nlandlords/lady's actual home, you should be\nclear as to what house-rules are to be\napplied. You should also try and get an idea\nof what they are like on a personal level.\nYou should be allowed to live in peace\nwithout interference from the owner (though\nthey may want to occasionally check the condition of the place). The owner is also\nresponsible for dealing with any repairs. If\nyou do experience problems with your landlord or landlady then you should raise them\nwith the Union Advisor immediately. Some\nproblems that can arise include getting the\nlandlord to do repairs or to return deposits\nat the end of a tenancy. There may also be\nissues relating to joint tenancies if you are\nsharing with other people. ICU produces a Housing Rights Guide to give you information on your rights and responsibilities while\nrenting in the private sector. Copies are\navailable from the Union reception. It is up\nto you to ensure that your landlord keeps to\ntheir side of the bargain. Don't put up with\nbad or unsafe accommodation and don't wave goodbye to your deposit at the end just\nbecause \"it's one of the facets of student life\nin London\". It isn't. If you have any problems with property that\nyou obtained via the Accommodation notice-board, you should write and tell them about\nit as they can only monitor the landlords who\nadvertise via your feedback. Properties are\nnot inspected nor vetted by college in any\nway. However, if the Accommodation Office\nhas been told of a problem, they can and\nwill remove landlords from their list.\nCouncil Tax\nAll students are exempt from Council Tax (but\nyou'll need to obtain a certificate from the\nregistry that you then send to your local\nbilling authority). If you share with non-stu-dents then you may become liable to pay\n(even if they are unemployed and receiving\nbenefits). Speak to the Union Advisor if you\nare unsure of your Council Tax situation.\nGas Safety\nEvery year there are deaths caused by carbon monoxide. Danger signs include soot or\nd is colouring on or around a gas fire, a yellow flame in your gas fire or water heater and\na strange smell when the appliance is on.\nSymptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning\nare tiredness, headaches, and chest and\nstomach pains. Your landlord must ensure\nthat all gas appliances are checked yearly\nand, by law, has to obtain a Certificate of\nGas Safety from a Corgi registered engineer.\nSpeak to him/her if you have any concerns.\nIf your landlord refuses to show you the\ncertificate or even to have the appliances\nchecked, contact the Gas Safety Helpline\nimmediately.\nMeningitis\nBy now I expect that almost all the students\nat Imperial have heard about the tragic\nevents earlier this year. The best thing we can\ndo now is learn.\nAlthough knowing the symptoms is vital, the\nmost important thing is quick action. In real-it y, you start by feeling unwell, perhaps bad\nenough to go home then and there. When\nyou get home you might be sick or just close\nthe curtains and try to sleep. This is the point\nwhen you should phone the ambulance, but\nyou won't because you will feel too silly.\nHopefully, you would phone when the\nheadache became too bad or you realised\nyou couldn't stand the light, but you might\nstill feel daft.\nSo maybe the truth about surviving meningitis\nis bite the bullet. Pick up the phone and dial\n999. No-one in Casualty will think you are\nstupid. You could save your own or someone else's life and if it is only a cold then\nyou'll live to tell a great story down the bar!\nWhat are the different types?\nThere are two types: Viral and Bacterial,\nwhilst viral is the most common it is unlikely\nto be life threatening. Bacterial meningitis is\nquite rare but may be very serious. There are\nHH Hk two types of bacterial meningitis; men in go co c cal and p neum oc occ al. In addition the\nbacteria can result in septic a emi a. How is bacterial meningitis spread?\nMany people carry the bacteria in the back\nof the throat. Whilst the bacteria can be\nspread by kissing, sneezing and coughing it\nis weak outside the body. After exposure\nsymptoms usually appear after 2-1 0 days.\nWhat does meningitis do?\nIt inflames the tissues that cover the brain\n(meninges) and spinal cord. The same bacteria responsible for inflammation of the\nmeninges are also responsible for the variant men in go co c cal septic a emi a, which\ncauses bleeding under the skin.\nCan I develop meningitis?\nThe risk of developing meningitis is very\nsmall, even if you have been in direct contact with a diagnosed case. The causal bacteria is carried, in fact, by approximately 10\npercent of people. There is still a risk, how-ever, and it saves lives if you are aware of\nthe symptoms.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe symptoms are similar to flu in many\nrespects, but symptoms get progressively\nworse very rapidly. Symptoms include; vom-it ing, fever, severe headache, joint pains,\naversion to bright lights, lethargy, confusion\nand fits. In addition to this rashes appear during septic a emi a. However, it is important to\nnote that not all the symptoms may be pre-sent.\nDon't wait for the rash - sometimes it's only\nseen at post mortem.\n\n"

Saturdays,\ni \u00a35/\u00a39/\u00a311, 10.30pm4 am, capacity -i1,400. Nearest Tube - Tottenham Court\nI Road. Dress code - most funky (see\nI below). Info line - 01426 944764.\nii Car wash the name itself has I become synonymous with disco and j funk throughout the UK. Now in their\ni tenth year, we went to check out what all the fuss was about at their home venue, the LA2.1 say this 'cos they often\nplay away, staging events across the \u2022 country, throughout club land, and at\nsome of the larger and more funky student unions. If only our's was so - shame.\nNow the first thing that you have to Shazz\n'Carry On'( Columbia/Reverb)\nLifted from Sha zz' s eponymous debut, this single, featuring Char maine King on vocals, doesn't do him or his\nalbum any justice. The production may be polished, as you would expect, but\nthe tune just doesn't cut it. The blurb\ndescribes it as \"mid-tempo house\" with\n\"considerable dancefloor energy,\" but\nI'd say it sounds as lethargic as student\non a Sunday morning. I can't really Imagine this giving any dancefloor a blast of energy. But all Is not lost, 'cos If you play\nthis at +8 on your decks then it begins to\nsound alright - fuck knows why they\ndeal with on a trip to Carwash, is the\ndress code. The door policy is strict and only those of you who make the effort\nwill make it in. Now some people may moan that strict door policies arc a bag of shite, but it's the people who make Carwash the night that it is, so you only\nwant those who are willing to make an effort to'make it past the door. You don't want any old scruffy geezers making it in\n'cos it just wouldn't be fair on every-body else. And once you're inside you'll\nsee what it is really like - funk a rama. So to ensure all you disco chicks and funk ster s get in, here's an insiders guide\nto, well, how to get in (provided by the\nmanagement themselves). The following\nthings are in: Stylish Funky Outfits, I lares,\nSatin, Shiny Club w car, UV Shirts, Platforms, Kinky Boots, Feather Boas, Glitter,\nHot Pants, Sequin Bra Tops, Hipsters,\nBunches, Catsuits, Baby Doll Dresses,\nNew York Street Funkster, Pimp Suit,\nCowboy Hats, Funky Waistcoats, FVC,\nFairy Wings.

If \"mid-tempo house\" is your sort of thing then\nbuy this on vinyl and crank it up. Don't go near the CD though, or you might just\nfall asleep.\n\u2022\nSash\n'Colour the World'\n(Multiply Records)\nThe Euro-house king's latest single is,\nstrangely enough, a Euro-house tune\nincorporating African vocals and sounds.\nIt's very different from the stuff he's released in the last couple of years,\nwhich has always had those cheesy vocals. 'Colour the World' features vocals\nlions, Nike, Adidas, and Fila Trainers,\nTacky Cheesy 70s.Now that those necessary technicalities are out of the way let's move onto\nwhat the night itself is really like. Was it\nup to all the hype? YES. Everything just\nslots into place once you descend down those steps into the LA2. The main bar\narea is a sea of UV light, where every-one's already funky outfits become even\nmore groovy, and the fluorescent cups\nand bar area also make for a nice touch. This is a good place to chill-out and enjoy\nthe alternative 70s reality which is Carwash. But there is an unexpected twist\nto this room after a while they start to\npump out the grunge(!)( Nirvana, Rage\nAgainst the Machine ct al.), in what I think is a bizarrely cunning way of getting all the punters down to the main\ndan cc floor. It didn't work 'cos some of\nthem just regressed to their instinct-driven teenage years and started moshi ng around. There was only so much of that\nwhich I could take, so I decided to ven ture downstairs.\nAnd at the main dancefloor it didn't seem as if they needed any encourage ment to stay. It was packed, but with sl ill enough room for everyone to strut their\nfunky stuff (except for the podiums where some strategic pushing was needed to let your talents show). This\nand sounds from Africa, and Sash has\ntried to incorporate these into a Lurohouse-type tune. It works quite well,\nbut it's not as good as the stuff he used\nto make and doesn't feature the th um ping bass lines that trademark Sash's tunes. Comes with three remixes - the\ntune is out in the next month. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDa Book\n'A Bomb from aIr i end' Weird, but good tun c, this track is\na hybrid of hip-hop sounds and garage-beats that works quite well. On the one hand, we have slow vocals whilst on the\nmain arena is arranged on several different levels with podiums galore, plenty\nof spaces to rest after your exertions, and a wicked guy on the bongos( this time\ncomplementing the music).\nThis is a class act through and through. From the professional dancers\n(a chick boy wearing a pair of white\nfluffy speed os, and a girl with a Bucks\nFizz-like strip routine), to the groovy sets,\nmixed by residents Charlie Angel, Dexter,\nand The Disco Kid, this really is Disco and\nfunk for C lubbers. And it never gets\ncheesy despite being a70s night. This is\nnot shitty student union/ office party\nmusic for the masses, but rather a great\nblend of classic disco and90 s club\nremixes of funk/disco tunes.\nOne of the best nights I 've been to\nin the capital, 'cos it's just so much fun. If you want a break from serious, hardcore dance music then go to Carwash\nand just groove without a care in the\nworld. Check out their double CD too it's lush.\nBoogie Nights.\nRoobarb\nother, the beat is almost garage style.\nThe track comes with three mixes, one which is a garage version and while the\nother two have deep, slow vocals on a hip-hop sounding beat. Out in the next\nmonth, it's a tune worth checking out.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAlbum and Singles by\nGur m and Roobarb\n\n"

    "content": "12 Arts 1 March 1999\nPARSIFAL\nEnglish National Opera, London Coliseum\nT he ENO is renowned in London for\nmaking opera much more accessible to people other than opera fanatics. All of its performances are in the English language, making it easy for everyone to understand. This generally\ncreates an odd effect, especially if you're\nused to hearing the pieces in their original language, which is often much more musical (especially for the Italian com posers). But ENO productions are mostly\nof very high quality and their repertoire\nis quite varied and exciting.\nParsifal is one of Wagner' s master-pieces, first performed in 1882. The story\nis quite complicated so I will try my best\nto make it as coherent as possible. Titurel\ncreates an order of chivalry to guard the Holy Grail. His son Amfortas is then cho sen by the knights to succeed him. Meanwhile Klingsor is refused adm is sion as a member and turns to sorcery,\nwounding Amfortas with the Spear from the Grail. He can only be healed by a pure fool made wise. While in agony, Amfortas is unable to officiate the knights' ritual. This Is when Parsifal comes into the picture. He has fatally injured a swan to the horror of all the knights. To\nspare you too many details, Parsifal\n(played by Kim Begsley, pictured) turns\nout to be the pure fool the knights have\nbeen searching for. Wagner' s inspiration\nfor this work includes pagan and Christian myths (Chretien de Troyes' legends\nin particular). He was also influenced by\nSchopenhauer's beliefs and Buddhist tra-and the details seem to take on an immense importance.\nThe ENO has worked in collaboration\nditions, which account for the richness of\nthe themes explored in this opera. All the\nwith companies in San Francisco and Chicago for this production. The result is\nvisually stunning opera. All the designers\ninvolved have made a great creative\neffort to modernise the decor, lighting\nand costumes. Their ideas are very inventive and appropriate to the theme. The\nchoreographer also made a brilliant job of bringing a lot of movement to the various scenes. The direction is haunting\nand very complex, to the Image of Wag ner's original vision. The artists' voices are\na dream. All the men deliver absolutely\nbeautiful solos and the only female character sings with breathtakingly purity.\nThe only shortcoming of this production is that it lasts a total of five and a half hours including the intervals! However the time flies by with such exciting\ndelight for the eyes and ears. This is\nopera at its best, drawing intensely on the audience's emotions and pushing them to their limits, both moral and ph ys ical. I can only recommend this to every-one. Opera made accessible both\nfinancially and artistically is quite rare, so\njust give it a try!\nD. Nearest tube: Leicester Square/Charing\nCross\nTickets: student standby \u00a318, standing\nroom \u00a32.50\nPerformance dates: March3,16&19 at\nheroes' actions have deep meanings overwhelming. I have rarely seen such a5 pm, March6&13 at 4 pm GREAT AMERICAN CHOREOGRAPHERS\nPacific Northwest Ballet at Sadler's wells\nReturning to Britain following their successful contribution at\nthe Edinburgh Festival last year,\nthe Seattle-based Pacific Northwest Ballet, founded in 1 9 7 2 , makes its\nLondon debut with a mixed programme of innovative modern dance. First on the bill was Aract, a work commissioned to celebrate the recent\n25th anniversary of the company. Set\nto a piano piece by the post minimalist composer Fitkin, the animated performance fluently blends serenely classical elements with more jazzy influences( pictured left).\nThe world premiere of In the\nCourtyard choreographed by Donald Byrd was the next offering in the schedule. The modern sound recording combined with powerful lighting and vivid costumes produced a memorable and striking ensemble. Staged by PN B artistic director KentS to well, Quaternary is set to Rachmaninoff' s Suite No.2, op.17for Two Pianos composed in 1901 (pic-tu red right). As the title suggests, four\ncouples perform a sequence of pas\nde deux to four contrasting movement styles ( march, waltz, romance and tarantella). Unfortunately, this\ndissonant act was somewhat diminished by unflattering and un inventive costumes. Finally, The four Temperaments\nchoreographed by George Balanchine is considered the visually stunning signature piece of the Pacific Northwest Ballet. This act was the definitive\nhighlight of the evening, warmly received and appreciated by the audience. The confident interpretation of such an intricate and technically demanding ballet reveals the imp res sive standard attained by this accomplished50 strong troupe. Tanya\n\n"

I remember hearing Local Boy in Ihe\nPhotograph for the first time - it was on some random indie compilation\nof 'one's to watch out for.' I was blown away by it. I wanted to buy their album straightaway, only to find that they did-n't even have a record deal. Since then,\nthey signed to V2, knocked up one of the best out and out rock ' n' roll albums of '97 and were rewarded for their\nextensive touring by notching up unexpectedly high sales. Word has a funny\nway of getting around, you know. Performance & Cocktails is their seco nd album and it's aston ker. It's hard to\nsay how many bands like this will be\naround come the turn of the millenium.\nRock 'n' roll is changing and if there isn'ta searing drum loop or random vocal\nsample blitzing through the distortion,\npeople don't seem to be buying it - it's a shame really because they're missing\nout on a treat.\nKelly's powerful, gravelly, nicotine-stained, throat-scratching voice pulls\neverything together quite nicely, the first\ntwo singles show how he can change from one style to the other while still\nmaintaining his distinctly recognisable\nwarble. He ram-raids his way through\nThe Bartender and The Thief which I'm convinced Is about two lesbians, while\nquietly building on a soulful verse into a screaming chorus on Just Looking.\nSingles arc scattered throughout this\nalbum like sabbatical election posters\non the walkway. / Wouldn't Believe Your\nRadio sounds like a distant cousin of the\nManics' cover of Raindrops Keep falling\nOn My Head. Is Yesterday Tomorrow's Today? is probably the biggest single\nhere and its radio-friendly nature will\nprobably mean a high chart entry (even\nthough the charts mean next to nothing nowadays). Hurry Up and Wait is another\none of those soul-searching numbers akin to one of their previous singles,\nTraffic. T Shirt Suntan could be seen as\nstandard rock fare but there's something special there that you can't quite put\nyour finger on. Some bands have it,\nsome bands don't. The Stereophonies\nhave it and unlike the first album, they\nnow knowhow to use it.\nI finish with a plea for an endangered species. The tigers of rock ' n' roll\nare dying out or being killed off. Don't let\nthem die. Fight for your right to rock.\nTrue, you could easily call this album Word Gets Around Again but as some blok e once said, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it, baby.' El Dennis\nSLEATER KINNEY\nThe Hot Rock\nQ BURNS ABSTRACT MESSAGE\nFeng Shui No Stars\nSleater Kinney - they\nra aaa www kk. Sl eater Kinney. Sounds a bit like a law firm, doesn't it? A reputation\nand a good name built on professional dependability and good taste.\nIt's actually a female trio, which I always\nhave a lot of time for, from the U.S. and they're a Hole( sic) lot better than\nanother band that I'm not going to\nmention in this review. For those of you that were lucky enough to hear their\nfirst release on British soil, Dig Mc Out,\nyou'll already know that they rock out\nlike the proverbial bastard.\nIt'd be unfair to say that they haven't progressed, but it is quite obvious that\nthis is the same band that graced on our\nshores in '97. They're sarcastic and cutting edge. They're exuberant in a violent\nsort of way. Their guitars flirt with you with their stop-start jutting before going for the jugular with frighteningly simple\nhooks. They have an adorable way of\ntwinning dual vocal and guitar action\nand when this is executed they produce\nthe most exhilarating flashpoint s of the\nalbum Burn Don't Freeze and One\nSong for You being glorious examples of\nthis thrilling interplay.\nThey have grownup a bit, though. Not a lot, mind just a bit. There is definitely a tighter feel to some of the tracks.\nIt's a fact that it took twice as long as to\nrecord as Dig Mc Out. However, when that time is clocked in at three and a half\nweeks, you won't be changing that rad-ic ally it's still smash y, it's still trashy, it's still shout y, it's still pout y, it's still punk\nthat goes straight for the throat, it still\ngets you excited and it still resonates with\nsharp s as sines s. Sleater-Kinney - not a law\nfirm, then. Just a greatly underrated punk-pop band. CI Dennis\nW hen I first received this album, I immediately thought 'What a stupid name for a group, I wonder if the album will be just as bad'.\nI wasn't let down. This album takes the\nword poor to new dimensions, but in\nthe interests of journalism, I forced\nmyself to listen to the whole bloody\nthing. Why is it so bad then? All the\ntracks on the album feature very simple\nsounds using synths, guitars, drums,\nsome sort of giant wind chime and, occasionally, vocals. Now, what makes this album so bad, is that all the tracks\nsound exactly the same; you don't know when one track has finished and another one has begun( and no the\nalbum is not mixed!). There are eleven\ntracks on this album, and it seems that\nQ burns have made no attempt at\ndoing anything original or creative, and have simply used the 'cut and paste'\noption on whatever music programme they happened to be using as much as\npossible. In fact, it seems that absolutely no time has been taken over this\nalbum the whole thing was probably\ncreated during a commercial break in\nthe middle of Richard and Judy. It doesn't make easy listening, because the\ntracks 'do your f****n' head in', nor is it\ndance or indie. Basically, the tracks arc\nmade up of simple beats ( when they\nappear) and the most simplest of strings, more often than not, combined with triangles and strange beeps. The\n'vocals' consist of out of tune words,\nthough more often they consist of strange wailing sounds. I guess if you like minimalist sounds( and talent) then\nthis is the album for you. If Q burns'\nabstract message is that these 'sounds'\nare some sort of musical statement\nthen it is too abstract for anyone to pick\nup on. If, however, the abstract message Is that Q burns have no musical\ntalents whatsoever then they have hit\nthe nail of the head. Absolutely pathetic and should be avoided at any cost H Gurm\n\n"

This was Interesting even for those who where familiar with Linux's back-ground; people were on the edge of their seats as Ed told us how the intro-duct ion of( relatively) cheap PCs in the80 sled to the development of MINIX, intended to help with teaching OS principles, which provided the original\nbasis for Linux.\nIn parallel with this Thomas Sippel-Dau installed Linux on a PC in the room, and explained the handful of option screens you go through during the process. The installation was surprisingly straightforward and took about 20 minutes, Ihe only problem being Thomas forgetting what he entered for the root password( he got it eventually).\nNext Sunny Chan demonstrated By Marc Broster\nNot just DoC students attended the meeting\nsome office applications and desktops,\nresulting in several cries of\" I have got to get that\" from the excited audience. After a break for coffee Gerd jan Busker from the Physics department told us why Linux was ideal for scientific visualisation and simulation,- whoever was responsible for making Windows NT the dominant OS for a certain department's computing lab\nmust have felt humbled, and with good reason. finally Marco Lu chin i from the Maths department discussed using Linux to network a group of PCs to provide high levels of processing power. I learnt more about parallel computing in these20 minutes than I did in a term's course on the subject.\nOverall, the event was excellent,\nand the room was packed out with a good cross section of Imperial's population, students, lecturers, and a fair\nnumber of people from outside college - one group even made the arduous journey from the Natural History\nmuseum.

    "content": "1 March 1999 Not the News 17\nPratt Smashes Walking Record By Ross Newell\nThis week Dr Pratt smashed his own record for walking backwards during a lec-ture. Dr Pratt held the previous record for\nwalking backwards during a lecture at\n10.7km in a50 minute lecture. However on Monday Dr Pratt broke his own record,\npushing back all the limits, and left the\nrecord standing at 15.8km. Dr Pratt, who likes to be known as Dr\nCool (though more commonly referred to\nas ' Oh God it's him, hide'), is known and avoided throughout the Shep Main Dept\nfor his unique personality. He has been practising backwards walking in the Terrace Lecture Theatre while no students are\npresent (during his lectures). Previously he\nhad been using the linear walk like most\nother lecturers, but having mastered this\nhe turned his attention to the more difficult cyclic jog.\nThe linear walk (LW) is the standard\nhomage used by the lecturer. Lecturers\nare taught the LW on entering the profession and most use no other. In this\nmethod the lecturer approaches the board forwards often bowing to the Goddess of the Blackboard, Jane. Sometimes\nthe bow is disguised as tripping up on the\nbin/chalk/carpet/air. Once the blackboard\nis reached some sacrificial chalk is offered\nusing sacred and incomprehensible sym-bol s, then the board is retreated from\nwhile still facing the surface in order to\nshow respect for the great Jane, often\nincluding a large bow disguised as tripping\nover absolutely nothing and landing flat\non their behind. The process is repeated,\nall the time chanting complete rubbish.\nThe cyclic jog however does not approach the board forward instead the\nlecturer walks backwards towards the board thus showing his or her disrespect\nfor Jane, and continues to walk backward\npast the board, often writing some blas-ph emo us symbols on the board. Then the\nboard is retreated from in the conventional way. finally the lecturer completes\nthe circle and the process is repeated.\nThis system is unpopular because of the offence caused to Jane and often\nresults in expulsion from the sect of Academia. However it does have some per-form ance benefits. Since the lecturer\nnever stops walking and always walks in\na backward direction, the distance walked\nduring a lecture is often double that\nobtainable using a LW and hence has been the target of many professional\nbackwards walkers for some time. None however have managed to perfect the method until now. After 2 years of practice Dr Pratt has\nperfected the backwards walk and put it\ninto practice in order to break his own record. During the lecture Dr Pratt walked\nin 1456 complete circles all in the reverse\ndirection. He used 28,343 footsteps and spoke 123,000 words explaining what a wonderful person he is.\nDuring the lecture he explained how he had single handedly solved all Shep\nMain related problems ever, including\nones previously solved before his birth. He\nwent on to say what a wonderful person\nhe is. He explained how the walk was sponsored and he would raise \u00a310,000\npounds for the DPAF. He finished the lecture by giving a15min talk on how wonderful he is.\nThe Dr Pratt Awareness Fund (DPAF)\nis a charity set up by Dr Pratt to spread the\nword about Dr Pratt and all the won de rful things he does. It organises TV, Radio,\nMagazine and ne ws paper interviews for\nDr Pratt, with all pro cedes from the interviews going to the DPAF. The DPAF is\nfocusing on the third world where people\nhaven't learned to avoid Dr Pratt yet and may still donate money to continue his\nself promotion campaign. The DPAF\nhopes that eventually there will be noone who docs not know about Dr Pratt and he\nwill be able to be on TV or Radio 24 hours\nper day, with a string of fans following him\naround explaining what a wonderful person he is.\nAl the moment Dr Pratt has no fans\ndespite most of the first world being aware of his existence. Some people believe that Dr Pratt may become more popular if he had a slightly less obnoxious\npersonality - none have been able to tell\nthis to Dr Pratt due to his refusal to stop\ntalking about what a wonderful person he\nis.\nOnce the walk was over everyone\nwent to the dinner party organised by Dr\nPratt for himself. Everyone ate some food,\ndrank some drink, listened to Dr Pratt,\nkicked his head in and went home. Dr Pratt gives weekly lectures in Terrace equation manipulation in the Terrace\nLecture theatre every Wednesday after-noon.

    "content": "20 Music 1 March 1999\nDe/ert Gagle Due/ Interview\nThis is the first in a series of interviews\nwith some of the best acts in the British\nscene, this week we bring out killer\nsounds of Desert Eagle Discs and next\nweek comes an interview with the British\nR&B diva Beverly Knight! Stay wired up to\nTha Bomb. When I was first offered this interview I didn't have a clue who Desert\nEagle Discs were, the name sounded familiar, but it\n.,. didn't immediately make ime jump I up. Further\n\u2022 invest i gal l tion quickly\nf showed them to bef one of the most\ntalented British\ncrews around. The Desert Eagle Discs\nBritish duo prod u cer Syze-Up and vocalist Shari\nhave\nD Bt^ been crea toll! nE? t ne underground\" for sometime now, stateside they have\nbeen busy than most,\nwith the DED name well\nknown in the right circles.\nHaving only just found who Desert Eagle Discs\nwere and checked out their stunning debut album 'The Lagle Has Landed' I found myself interviewing one half of this wicked group SyzeUp.\n\"I started messing about with sounds about fifteen years ago in my garage\".\nWhen he was just thirteen Syze-Up\nstarted out Djing, his equipment was pretty basic but he was able create loops\nusing a tape machine and so started\nbuilding a library of samples. As he grew his skill z began more and more honed; he was soon rocking the hip-hop heads\nwith his furious turntable talents. He was soon frustrated with just Djing and it was a natural progression on to production.\n\"Basically, Desert Eagle Discs started out\nas my sound system, I used to play out\nat this club and I invited rappers along to\nfreestyle over some beats, that's where Shari comes in, she just jumped up and started free styling, I knew she was something special straight away\". He ain't joking her vocals are beautifully sultry and the girl herself is dazzling. Her vocals\nover Syze-Up's hard dark beats are a perfect match.\n..The two of them searched for a record deal\nt and in '96\n^they were[ signed to\n-Boiler-Pi Records, they immediately started work on their album. \"The album isn't RnB, I'm not really in to that side of the music, I prefer something a little harder, more gutsy, I'm a hip hop head\". Syzc-Up, real\nname Simon Ingerfield, was influenced by hiphop greatly, but\nwanted to make an album that showed \u2122**v.a darker side of hip hop beats with\na blue sey feel to them. \"We still wanted a hip-hop\nalbum, and that's why we got 21 soldiers\non a couple of tracks, they're a young crew outta Brooklyn,\nwho are on the way up\". Originally DFD were I meant to hook up with the then\nunknown AZ, but as they\nP flew over lo the states AZ blew up with the massive 'Sugarhill' and they\nwere knocked back. 21 Soldiers were from the same place as AZ and they\nshared the same manager, once AZ pulled out il was natural for 21 Soldiers\nto step in.\nTwo years between getting signed and the album actually drop pin', what's up\nwith that? \"I 've been hard remixing a lot\nof stuff, soon my Masc remixes are going to drop pin'. We have been putting out a lot of white label stuff and tried to build\nup a following on the underground before the album release.\" The DED name is massive in the remix world, it all\nstarted with a Gabrielle remix that SyzcUp did, someone in the states heard it\nand the next thing was a Lil Kim remix for\n'Crush On You' after this dropped the\nphone didn't stop. Syze-Up's London groove was/is in hot demand, he reworks\nthe entire tune coming back with some thing brand new. Busta phoned up for a remix on the 'Dangerous' single, \"Yeah\nwe flipped that one and used some ad lib s from Busta to rework the tune\".\nSyze-Up smoothed it out and stuck Shari's vocals on the back to create a much more funky dangerous that was as infectious as the first.\nThe Desert Eagle gun is the most powerful handgun in the world and the\nDesert Eagle Discs come with that same forcefulness in their hard hitting sounds.\nMile n "

    "content": "i March 1999 Games ^ Hj^25 Shogo - Mobile Armoured Division (PC)\nMonolith\nAwash with single person shoot-em-ups before Xmas, on both the PSX and the PC, we missed out on the odd one or two. It was unfortunate that we missed out on Shogo Mobile Armoured Division; partially because It\nis a good game, but mostly because of the lost practice time in order to com pete in the big Shogo showdown. Well\nperhaps not, but in order to save face\nand not be completely crushed by a bunch of spotty fourteen year olds, the team decided to get some practice in\nand kick some metallic butt.\nThe big thing with first person shooters is that you play a character\ncapable of carrying an unfeasible amount of military hardware. They might have been pumping iron, eating spinach, and have a damn impressive\npowered suit on, but from where do they secrete pistols, automatic weapons, and rocket launchers, while finding space to fit\nenough explosive to have a damn good attempt at a second gunpowder plot.?\nAnswers on the back\nof a postcard. Shogo doesn't disappoint the big weapon fans. Not only can you rack up a fairly impressive amount of military\nhardware in human form but you have the\nchance to jump into\none of four thirty foot me chan is ed beasts. These me ch s have names Or dog, Enforcer, A kuma and Predator,\nand with names like that the weaponry obviously gets really silly.\nThere is a very strong Japanese theme running a mile wide through the game; from the Japanese pop during the cartoon all the way to the Anim c graphics of the characters both good and bad. Even I, a pix-el thirsty polygon serial killer,\ntended to\nthink twice when the enemy consisted of doe eyed females, though the pre-pu be sent looking male characters were a delight to kill, as\nthey looked too much like the average boyband cast.\nGraphically it follows the Anime ideals\nof big and blocky.\nThus it doesn't have\nthe organic feel that\nHalf-Life has. Another problem is the large,\nexpansive battlefields.\nIn order to display these large outdoor scenes they have\nhad to simplify the polygons. This at\nleast means that on a low end Pentium and decent video accelerator there was none of the usual pop-up or fogging. The sound, though, was average. It\nhad big rumbling robot footsteps and big explosive sounds, but fell short of the best. There was none of the whoosh of incoming fire from opposing sides,\nthough the cockpit\nof these behemoths have pro b ably been coated in\nthe same stuff they use on f ex us cars\nto reduce noise level. It might be nice\nfor a luxury car - not so good at creating the effect of the heat of battle.\nOne little gem, though, is the idea\nof a squad. Instead of being the only\nman in, you often get dropped in with\na few friends. These helpfully fire at\nthe enemy and soak up the incoming fire. This can lead to red-on-red incidents where you get separated from your squad only to ambush and masacre them next time you run into\nthem, for once the good guys look much too similar to the bad guys. Apart\nfrom this feature the gameplay, while being enjoyable and challenging on the harder levels, never quite reaches\nthe same range of emotions that Halflife can. If you buy a second first person\nshooter this spring seriously consider\nthis one, if you are only out to buy one then Half-life still rules this kingdom, Gary 5.\nSouth Park (N64)\nAcclaim \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAnother first person shooter? A poorly\nwritten attempt to cash in on the cult cartoon as the second series is about to hit\nthe terrestrial scene? Well yes and definitely no.\nYour favourite four little urchins are\ncalled upon lo use their wits, charm, cheesy poofs and some unusual vocabulary to save South park from aliens,\ngenetically modified turkeys, giant cloned\nSouth Park reis den ls and other equally\nweird and f***\" up situations.\nArmed with Cartman's yellow snowballs, Kenny'scow launcher or\nthe Terrence and Philip Farting doll\ngrenade it's time to teach the turkeys\nI and the other denizens of the odd the meaning of foul play.\nThe graphics are excellent. Someh ow they have managed to trans-form the two dimensional cartoon\ninto a three di mention al festival of the bizarre without losing the charm\nof Kenny's hood or Cartman's large ass.\nThere' s also\nnone of this fogging that usually\ncomes free with\nevery N64 three\ndimensional polygon fest to\nnow. Also unus u ally for the N64\nthere are sampled voices of the\ncharacters, and each character has\ntheir own series of crises of joy\nand pain, all of which you would expect to hear on the TV series.\nThere is one problem with\nthis game, and that it is too funny\nto play. Half-life might cause you to pause with a we and give the\nenemy enough time to toast you, but this game has managed to kill\nme with laughter;\nstopping laugh- this was to play the excellent multi play cr ing quickly option. Here you get to pick any of the\nenough to get characters and go hunting your opp osi the next turkey is lion down. Even Mr Hanky finds his vio-difficult enough lent streak and definitely provides a new without making meaning to the phrase shitting on your\ngobbling sounds opponent. in the back- I his game is going to be larger than\nground.

However you don't go clubbing for the wallpaper (unless\nyou're particularly weird), you go for\nthe beats. And the beats were here in\nforce - after along build up. To be honest the main acts before the Brothers appeared were fairly disappointing. This could be a symptom of the fact\nthat it is very hard for the crowd to see the DJs and visa versa - the booth is almost completely blacked out and raised well above the main dancefloor.\nTurnmills do say they will be removing the blacked out glass so a little more communication can take place. But on the night, it turned out that the more chilled out and funky secondary dance floor was a far better choice.\nThe tension before the Chemicals\narrived was palpable - the Heavenly\nfaithful were out in force and they\nhelped whip the others into a frenzy -so much so that when one poor blok e had to fiddle with some lights on the\ndancefloor on a step ladder he was given a standing ovation from the rest\nof the club! The Bros, whipped out a blinding set, over 3 hours in total -including all the old favourites and, if Iam not very much mistaken a couple of brand new DATs doubtless to\nincluded in the long awaited new album. The night was given an added touch of hilarity by the antics of Gur m \"Klinsman\" Mar wah a who' s heroics for\nthe IC \"Disco Boys\" IV's resulted in a severely bruised leg and a pair of crutches - when we entered the club\nthe promoter shouted after us \"you'll\nbe needing more than the crutches by\nthe end of the night mate!\". Gur m did\nhowever put the crutches to good use in a couple of failed chat up attempts\nand several visits to the (very nice)\nbogs whereupon security cleared a path through the queues straight to a cubical just for him. Ahh hh. On exiting the club at the end of a truly titanic night we were all handed little goody bags of fun including flyers and aT shirt advertising the new replacement night for the Heavenly at\nTurnmills. Its called \"Headstart\" and promises to be a \"proper club for\nproper c lubbers\" for more details see the flyers on this page or call 0171 250\n3409. Nice sh. Also contained in this little bag of fun was a letter from all the\npeople who had helped put the Social\ntogether - one of the most heartfelt\nand touching things I have read in along time. You can tell the Heavenly\nmeant a lot to a lot of people.\nI can't wait for the second st coming. $ - ^ f Hf \u2022\n\u2022\n!\nJoel\nSinolss\nand\nAlbum\nAlbum of the Week\nProdigy Presents:\nThe Dirtchamber Sessions Volume 1\nIt's hard to imagine, but back in the\n80's, long before the Prodigy, Liam\nHowlett was a DJ in the Essex Hip-Hop\nband Cut to Kill. He once entered a Capital Radio mixing competition, decided that the tape he had submitted\nwas shit, and sent off another one. The\ntwo tapes won first prize and third prize.\nThe Dirt chamber Sessions Volume1 demonstrates that Howlett has lost none of the old mixing skills. The album started off as a session recorded for Mary\nAnne Hobb's Breezeblock segment on Radio 1 and is a trip through the sounds that have influenced the Prodigy into\nthe band that they are. The music goes through a huge spectrum of genres including raw hip-hop, edgy rock and Old Skool beats. Howlett has used some quality tracks, including tunes by the Charlatans. The mixing is superb, and it's amazing how Howlett has managed to\nput It all together.

Previous years have proved very successful,\nwith over a million smokers regularly giving up for the day, and around forty\nthousand quitting on a more permanent basis. Events promoting the day will\nbe taking place throughout the country,\norganised by various health promotion agencies, heart and cancer charities,\nand smoking education bodies.\nMeanwhile Forest, the smokers' rights group, has urged students to g no reNo Smoking Day, dismissing It as\n'health fascism\". In retaliation Forest is\norganising a trip to Paris for the day, and is suggesting that students all over Britain should join them, to escape what Forest's director Simon Clark called \"24\nhours' continuous nagging from the\nhumour less anti smoking brigade\". Despite Mr Clark's comments, No Smoking Day can be a useful time for many would be quitters,- as the UK has the highest smoking rate among1624 year-olds in Europe, this can only be a good thing.\nFor more details contact Quit line(0800002200) or Forest (07071 766537).\nVirgin Internet Bid\nVirgin are investing \u00a350 million to get all\nparts of the empire fitted with e com-mer ce facilities. Virgin Net, the group's nter net company, is also expanding its\nservice and offering free web space and email addresses to the general public, starting in May of this year. The investment plans are all part of a more general program of promoting internet\ngrowth, and in particular internet shopping using Virgin outlets. While the move seems like a prudent business\ndecision, it remains to be seen whether the British public will want to purchase\ntheir plane and train tickets, music and video, financial services, wedding accessories and holidays over the net. And possibly their cola too. Falling Standards?\nFollowing the creation of new Universities in 1991, concerns have repeatedly\nbeen raised regarding the possible dilution of the traditionally high academic standards in British Universities. To investigate these allegations, Middlesex University is undertaking a study of standards in universities and colleges of higher education across Britain. The University apparently would like to hear\nfrom anyone who is in possession of\nconcrete evidence that standards are\neither being maintained or diluted. If\nyou feel you might be able to help, the\nUniversity invites you to contact Professor Alderman, Middlesex University,\nTrent Park, Bramley Road, London N14\n4YZ. Student Sub-Let\nShocker\nTwo female students have been thrown\nout of Queen Mary and Westfield Col\nleg e halls following the discovery during\nroom inspections that their rooms were being sub-let. The inspections were triggered following the receipt of an anonymous letter at the Residences Office by\nan irate student who had not been allotted a room in halls in any of her three\nyears at the college.\nUnconfirmed figures suggest that\none in every five rooms in the halls is\npermanently shared by a student and her or his \"partner\".\nBMA Racism Report\nThe British Medical Association (BMA)\nhas admitted that racism is not just rife,\nbut institutional is ed throughout the\" whole culture\" of the medical world This comes as new research has shown yet again that white applicants to med ical schools arc twice as likely to gain\nplaces as their black or Asian peers.\nThe admission comes as institutions\nacross the country are facing widespread condemnation and criticism\nregarding their policies and outlook towards racism in general. While many institutions have formed policies of not\ntolerating racism in any form, it remains\na fact that ethnic minorities are six times\nmore likely to face disciplinary action\nfrom the General Medical Council, while\nconsultants who are white are more than three times more likely to obtain a merit award than those from ethnic minorities. Moreover, junior doctors with\nAsian surnames have only half as much a chance of getting shortlisted for an\nNHS hospital job as others.\nThe acceptance is by no means uni\nversa l among the profession, however Prof Roderick MacS we en, chairman of the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges\nsaid: \"Ido not think the medical pro\nfess ion is racist in any way. Iam aware\nof accusations of racism. But the pro\nfess ion has looked at it and is very conscious that it must not be seen to be\nracist at all.\"\nUniversity Challenge\nUniversity Challenge season is here once again with the arrival of application forms from Granada tele-vision. So how can you get involved?\nOver two hundred colleges nation-wide take part in the first selection round, from which the best twenty-four are pulled out to take part in the televised rounds. I he competition is\nquite tough, which is why the College is on the lookout to capture the very\nbest team it can. Imperial unfortunately\nhasn't made it to the televised round since the1996/97 season, but this year\nthings will hopefully be different - with\nImperial aiming to repeat the successes of1995/6, when they won the\ncompetition. The squad will be selected via a quiz, which is expected to be held in\nearly March, the four best performers will form the team, with a fifth person acting as reserve. The only requirement is that, since the series will be aired from1999 to 2000, any team members must not just be current stu-dents; they must also be students for\nnext year.\nWhy would you want to take part?\nAccording to Chris Il arr is on, president of the ICU Quiz Society and sole mem ber of the winning team in 1996 still\nhere at Imperial, \" Being By Sunil Rao on IV is a lot of fun; the\nwhole recording process\nis a great laugh. It's hard work, but it's something you' ll never forget!\"\nTeams from Imperial have tended to suffer In the past as, being a college\nof Science, Technology and Medicine, most students arc well versed on sci-en ce related matters, but are woefully ignorant of anything to do with the arts\nworld in stark contrast to most coll e ges across the country who have trouble finding somebody to answer the science questions!

The\ncourses at\nImperial College are\ndemanding;\nthey require\ncommitment of\ntime and effort.\nIt's not unusual\nto experience a knock to your self-esteem to find yourself\namongst similarly intelligent students after\nhaving been at or near the top of your class\nat school.\nYou might have arrived at Imperial from\nanother country with different social and\ncultural norms, so that part of beginning at\nCollege involves the experience of living in\na different culture. Family and friends may\nbe a long distance away. And if you're coming to College straight from home you may\nhave to learn the practicalities of everyday\nliving as well! Coming to university might be\none of the biggest transitions you're going\nto make in your life.\nIf you're not used to organising yourself and\ngetting on with studying without a parent or\nteacher prompting you, it can be a considerable challenge to manage your work. On the other hand, sometimes students work too\nhard and get diminishing returns; fear of failure or 'letting people down' can get in the\nway of constructive studying.\nSometimes personal issues demand energy\nwhich you would otherwise be using to get\non with your life. Sometimes you'll know what\nthe problem is, eg a relationship difficulty,\na bereavement, an issue about self-confidence. But sometimes you might be aware\nof feeling depressed or anxious, of finding\nit difficult to concentrate at lectures or when\nstudying, for no immediately identifiable rea-son.\nMany students find it useful to come to\ncounselling when they're feeling troubled, to\ntalk about their experience, to think through\na problem, and to consider options and\ncreate a strategy to move forward. Issues students bring include; blocks to studying and\nexam stress; relationship difficulties; family\ndifficulties; homesickness; loneliness; de pre s sion; anxiety; bereavement; sexuality and\nsexual orientation.\nMartin Thomson\nThe Union\nhas an\nelected, non-sabbatical,\nwelfare committee who are responsible for taking\nup issues of\nconcern to\nstudents on welfare matters (these\nwould be\nissues related\nto the experience of\nstudying at IC rather than specific legal or\npersonal problems). The Union Welfare\nCommittee needs your input in order to\nrepresent your best interests and respond\nto your concerns. You can contact the\nWelfare Officer via the Union Office. As\nwell as the Welfare Officer himself, the\nUnion has a plethora of elected officers\nlooking out for your interests, including\naccommodation, equal opportunities,\nwomen's and Constituent College Union\nWelfare officers.\nA full-time adviser, Martin Thomson, is\nemployed in the Union to provide a professional advice service to students and\nstaff. The Advice Office has a very broad\ninformation system (which includes a full\nCitizen's Advice Bureau information data-base) and Martin has several years of general advice experience.\nIf you have a problem of any kind, or you\njust want information on a particular topic,\nthen he should be able to either assist you\nor, where necessary, refer you to an appropriate source outside of the College. The\nservice is free, confidential and impartial\n(which means that no matter what your\nproblem or situation is, you will receive\nunbiased assistance, not judgmental ques-t ions). Matters frequently dealt with include housing problems, immigration, consumer mat-ter s, debt, and fundraising (for students who\nrun out of money toward the end of their\nstudies). In addition to leaflets on the above\nthere is a broad range of free information\navailable in the Union reception which\nincludes material on health matters, ben-ef its, income tax and the small claims\ncourt.\nTo see Martin, you should make an appointment at the Union Office (x48060) or contact him directly.\nThe CCUs\nIt may seem sometimes that there's never\nanyone to talk to when you need advice.\nSure, your tutor helps you with your work,\nyour flat mates attempt to revive your flagging social life, and your parents send you\nemergency cash if you're lucky, but all the\nother stuff that you either can't ask or don't know how... All of the benefits of the policy and initiatives from ICU's hard-work-ing welfare committee are readily available\nto you, and you only need to ask. It's easy\nenough to email welfare@ic.ac.uk, and\nyour emails to welfare are guarded by a policy of confidentiality.\nYour own constituent college also has a representative - if you don't know whether\nyour particular issue is something that\nwelfare can deal with, or you just want to\nknow exactly what you're entitled to, you\nshould enquire with your C CU welfare\nrep, and they'll put you straight. They\nshould have a pigeon-hole in your C CU office (and if you haven't found that yet,\nyou've definitely been studying far too\nhard...!).

The Mary's mob were defeated elsewhere in\nthe use of New Election\nblock votes, which is\ngreat news, but represents a far\nmore pathetic spectacle. I have no doubt that\nthe success ful candidates so affected will\nhave the magnanimity to treat\nthem with same respect they exercise\nwhen dealing with the rest of us.\nSimon Baker\nVoice of Reason\npossible, for a camera would' infringe the privacy of other local residents.'\nLeaving aside the fact that\nmost residents are probably resigned to the intrusion that is Imperial College, this seems to be a bit of a red herring, because the camera need only be positioned in\norder that it\npoints towards Princes Gard ens. If this\nrequired additional light-ing, so be it.\nWhile this is\nclearly no panacea, the existence of a well publicised camera would deter some and make the SMS fell, I 'll go to the foot of our stairs. Five posts filled in one foul swoop. RON got absolutely nowhere, which must have upset the Rector, but it does mean we will not have to endure this malarkey again this year. Congratulations to all\nconcerned, who seem to be a pretty\nsolid bunch of chaps and ch apes s. It\nwas reassuring to see so many choose to stand this year and while some will\ndebate the relative proportions of quality and quantity, it bodes well for Imperial.\nThe Presidential race was particularly encouraging from the candidate count perspective, though it did not require Mystic Meg to predict the result\nfrom the outset. Though in noway meant as a slight at Natasha Newton, this election will be won by a medic one very occasion that they choose to field a candidate. Which, of course, brings me to the block vote. In a touching show of solidarity with the TUC, one man decided how the whole med ical school voted[ er, not this time Simon Ed], displaying unprecedented unanimity. To be fair, it is amazing that Wade Gaye d could organise any-thing successfully, but he has clearly\npulled out all the stops on this one,' detection of crime considerably easier.\nperhaps explaining his conspicuous ness of late matching that of Salman Rushdie in downtown Tehran. The upshot of the departmental voting means that Natasha won convincingly in only the medical campuses and Silw ood. The St Mary's vote was quite overwhelming, representing92% of the votes cast\nthere.\nAcross the' old' College, the vote was not so resounding. Iwo nder if the inevitability of the block vote is in\npart responsible for galvani sing the apathy of IC, leading people. to ignore the elections. Possibly, but il\ncertainly makes a mockery of the process. Some may call for a return to\nfirst past the post, a vastly superior system in my humble opinion, but at\nthe end of the day, ICU will elect its\nofficers in much the same way as the old Labour Party until the medics grow up and start using their not inconsiderable brains to think for themselves. Still, you can't blame Natasha for the behaviour of her sheep-like col leagues, so I wish her the very best.\nShe could be forgiven for thinking that\nthe medics are the only people that\ncount - why not, since much of College senior management has thought that\nMio re worrying ly,Ne ll suggest that the local police are get-it in gata d annoyed by the continued petty thefts from IC. Losing the police's goodwill would be disastrous for College, the ramifications of which extend far beyond additional pissed up students getting banged up\non a Friday night outside the Union. This would be precisely the sort of thing that could harm relations with\nthe local authorities vis-a vis planning applications. College Security have had a pretty\ngood track record of late, and I'm not just\nsaying that (though they do know were\nI live...). My own department benefits\nfrom some superb staff, as do many of\nthe other buildings on campus, representing a significant improvement on a few years ago. Bike theft remains their\nAchilles' heel, so their apparent reluctance to tackle the problem effectively\nmakes no sense.\nNeil Forsyth' s excellent letter\nabout College Security raises\nmany important points. Important, but far from novel, because this\nhas been dragging on for as long as\nanyone can remember. Column miles\nhave been written\nby myself an doth ers, with precious little positive outcome, and several\nincidents spring to\nmind; the best/ worst must surely be the bike\nremoved by cut-ting a Walkway bike stand with a power saw without\nanyone batting an eyelid. For what seems like a reasonably simple problem to tackle, the College attitude has always been puzzling and deeply dis-appointing. Ken Weir's letter was uncharacteristically unco nv inc ing, raising more questions than it\nsought to answer. The obvious move, as Neil suggests, would be to\ninstall a camera or\ntwo to cover the Southside bike racks, and for that mat-ter, all the others. This apparently is not\n\"It was good to see\nso many\ncandidates...while some\nwill debate the relative\nproportions of\nquality and quantity, it\nbodes well for Imperial.\"\nThe' advantage' of bike crime over other forms of theft is the c once ntr ation of the targets- it is not that hard\nto cover all of College's bike stands. This should not prove to be very costly,\nand is certainly better than plain clothes operation by the police. At this\npoint, someone will bleat about resources. It\nnever ceases to amaze mc how some people have the barefaced cheek to block small, important projects\nin the name of tight budgets, at\nan institution whose track record for prof li gacy makes Imelda Marcos' footwear collection look frugal. The College prod u ced a \u00a312 million surplus in 97/98,\ngiving us overall reserves of \u00a342.7\nmillion. On this\nbasis alone, there is no excuse for not spending a' few thousand on the necessary cameras; if it costs\nanymore than that, it'll be due to\nthe use of a College Approved Cowboy, er Contractor,\nbut don't get me started on that.\n\"...It never ceases\nto amaze me how\nsome people have the\nbare-faced cheek to\nblock important\nprojects in the name of\ntight budgets...\"\n\"...this election will be\nwon by a medic on\nevery occasion that they\nchoose to field a candidate...\"\nf hi leon the subject of Impe rial's incredibly limited resources, it was curious to\nnote that we have more staff earning \u00a350,000+ than Oxford and Cambridge combined. This concerns me. Don't get mc wrong, I have no problem with paying our academics a decent salary. On the contrary, I strongly believe that the best researchers should be properly rewarded. National\npay scales should, of course, be scrapped, giving universities complete freedom to pay whatever they want, including the introduction of performance related pay. My unease stems from another question how many are academic staff?\nUnfortunately, such figures are not published by\nEIEFCE, so I have to\nlimit myself to catching whispers on the breeze from others discussing the same point in the SCR. The truth is\nthat we seem to have a significant number of people in She rf icl don such salaries. I suppose this is to be expected with such a bloated management structure caused by decades of empire building. However, that\ndoes not make it acceptable. It would be an interesting exercise to sec how much money could ploughed into\nacademic salaries by taking a machete to our administration. Goon, Suite live, what do you say? We could even get the consultants in on this one... "

    "content": "Spring '99 ICU Welfare Newsletter\nHAVE YOU GOT A PROBLEM?\nDrug Abuse\nDrug abuse covers vast areas and many\ndrugs, ranging from puffing a cigarette to\ninjecting heroin. But two of the most commonly used illegal drugs are ecstasy and\ncannabis. This section will focus on them.\n\"Ecstasy\", also known as MDMA, Adam, or\nX TC, is an hallucinogenic and mind altering drug. It bears great similarity to other\nsynthetic drugs (like MDA) which are known\nto cause brain damage. The many problems the 1 in 12 people who have tried\necstasy in the UK encounter during or after\ntaking ecstasy include:\nPsychological difficulties, including conf u sion, depression, sleep problems, drug\ncraving, severe anxiety, and paranoia -sometimes these symptoms occur weeks\nafter taking ecstasy. Physical symptoms\ninclude muscle tension, involuntary teeth\nclenching, nausea, blurred vision, faint-ness, chills or sweating, increases in heart\nrate and blood pressure. However, its supporters claim that ecstasy increases trust\nand breaks down barriers.\nCannabis, the most used illegal drug with\n8 0 % of drug users using cannabis, is widely\nseen as 'relatively harmless' by its sup-porters. 'Relatively' harmless it may well be\nwhen compared to drugs like heroin, but\nit is not entirely safe,\neither. Cannabis can\ncause problems with\nmemory and learn-ing, distorted perce p tion, difficulty in\nthinking and problem\nsolving, loss of co ordination; and increased heart rate,\nanxiety, and panic\nattacks. Most damning of all is that two in\nfive people who have used cannabis in the\nlast year will have also used another type\nof illegal drug.\nFor more information, try:\nnews.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/back-ground_ briefings/ drugs/\nUS Institute on drugs: www.nida.nih.gov/\nDrug Abuse Web ring: www.drug use. com/\nRelease: www.release.org.uk\nSleepless Nights\nAre financial worries affecting your degree?\nAt this time of year the antics of the previous term may be catching up. Some students\nhave major financial worries that are crippling their ability to live comfortably. Other\nstudents may have less serious financial\ndifficulties but still find that these difficulties\nare making them feel stressed and depressed.\nIf you fall into any of the above categories;\nwhere your financial worries are putting a strain on your life and degree, then you\ncould qualify for financial support from the\ncollege. Imperial College has over\n\u00a31 5 0 , 0 0 0 to distribute among students who\nhave financial problems.\nSo how do you apply?\nGo to the Student Finance Office, on Level\n3 (Room 334) of the Sherfield Building and\npick up an application form. The form must\nbe filled in completely (failure to do so will\nslow your application) and returned to the\nStudent Finance Office with the following\ninformation: 3 months of Bank Statements\ngoing back from the date of your app lica tion.\nThe closing date for applications is 22nd March 1 999\nCheck your bits day\nThose of you who were here last year may\nremember waking up after Valentines Day\nwith an unusual union stamp on your hand.\nBy then it probably said 'heck your bi ', which\nwas perhaps more alarming than intended!\nFor those of you who weren't here, and for\nthose who have spent a year wondering\nwhy they were stamped in such a bizarre\nway, let me explain what Check your Bits is\nall about.\nIn this country, it is safe to say you are going\nto die of one of two things; Heart disease\nor Cancer. Most of us will be lucky and do\nit in our 80s. But there are some cancers\nwhich kill young people, and they are the\n'sexy' ones; cancer of the testis, cervix and\nextent breast. Check your bits day is a reminder to everyone to do something about\nnot dying young.\nThe good news is that there is no reason why\nyou should die from these; they are easily\nchecked for, and respond well to treatment.\nAll it takes is self-examination (a good feel\nall over) of your breasts or testicles once a month. If you find a lump, or a sore bit, or\na change in colour or texture or if it just\ndoesn't feel the same, then go to the doc-tor. As for the cervix, that's even easier;\nbook an appointment with the nurse, phone\nfor the results, repeat in 3 years time.\nSafety in the Big City\nWe are all enjoying our freedom at university - being able to go where we want,\nhow we want and when we want. As students we have to look out for our own well\nbeing. Yes, we have heard it all before\n\"don't walk alone, don't walk down dark\nstreets\". This is, of course, sensible advice.\nThis is why your wonderful Imperial College\nUnion is providing an extra bit of support.\nWhile a free bodyguard for every student is\nnot on offer, you can get an attack alarm\nfrom the union office or catch the free\nwomen's minibus home from the union\nafter events nights (Wednesday and Friday). This service runs from 1 2 am until the\nend of the event and will take any woman\nanywhere within London.\nCompiled by\nRene Frank & the\nWelfare Committee\n\n"

Firstly, congratulations and all that to the five of you.\nThere are still a few mumbling s in the\nbowels of IC about vote rigging, unfair\ncampaigning and suchlike, but I think\nit's safe to say elections are over.\nLet's be honest, though; many of\nyou non-medics are not happy with\nthe outcome. Many of you are screaming 'block vote' and cursing the ICSM\nExec under your breath. I think much of\nwhat Dennis says in his letter opposite\nis right. I also think that if the medics\ndid all vote for Natasha simply because\nshe is 'one of them' and to protect\nmedical interests, they are likely to be\nEngineering Information Resources\n3 March, 2.15pm4 pm Introductory Talk\n4 March, 1-2pm Compendex\n9 March, 1-2pm NTIS\nII March, 1-2pm ANTE\n16 March, 1-2pm INSPEC\n18 Marhc, 1-2pm Metadex\nAll take place in Central Library Level 5\nDeadline for letters is\n12noon Wednesday.\nLetters may be edited for length, but\nwill not be altered in any other way.\nLetters need not be signed, but a swipe card must be shown when submitting anonymous letters.\nNews Meeting- 12pm Clubscene \"f12 pm Thursday\nPhoent , ac T2pm\nFriday\nNews Meeting . 1.20pm Music Meeting 1.30pm disappointed.\nThe job of ICU President is to protect the interests of all IC students,\nregardless of their department or CCU.\nDepartments and CCUs have their own\nrepresentatives - ICSM have a full time\nsabbatical officer. When Andy Heeps\nwas elected certain Union hacks trembled at the prospect of ICU being taken\nover by ICSM. It didn't happen. In the\nregistry a sabbatical officer is listed as\nan 'interdepartmental postgraduate'.\nYou leave your departmental and other\nprejudices behind when you sign the\ncontract. I hope that everyone will\nremember that.\nIf the medics want to vote for a medic, I can't see a problem, as long\nas they remember that officer re pre Modem for Sale\nPCMCIA modem by Digicorp,\n28.8kB/s speed, brand new\nand boxed\ncomes with all hard and software\n(sealed), Includes some internet/mail\nsoftware,\u00a330,\nCall 0171 244 8060 or email\ndc197@ lc.ac.uk\nInterested in spending\n3 months in Nepal this\nsummer for sub sidi sed research?\nWe would need a( female) medic to\njoin us for the means of a research on\nthe interactions between Western\nmedicine and traditional healing\nmethods.\nContact:\nIsabelle Floyaux: l. hoy aux@ ic.ac.uk\nsent s ICU, not ICSM. Likewise I hope\nthat the reverse prejudice, which still\nlurks in hacks' corners in ICU, can be\nput aside. Judge sabbatical officers on\nhow they do the job, when they are\ndoing it. I would be the first to admit\nthat when Dave Hellard was elected\nlast year, I was sceptical. I am pleased\nto say that my scepticism was un war ranted, and that I have been proven\nwrong. Becoming as abb changed the\nway I acted and thought about stu-dents, ICU, and ICSTM. Once again\nmay I wish Natasha, Tim, Ian, Kevin\nand Dave all'the best. No doubt Felix,\nand its readers, will form opinions\nabout you next year.
