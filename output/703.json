    "content": "This is Tom Stoppard's classic play about philosophy and its\nabsurd relation with the real world. Dorothy, (Felicity Kendal)\nfailed vaudeville star, throws a party, whilst her husband,\nGeorge (Paul Eddington) desperately trying to finish his\nsymposium on the existance of God. The festivities are abruptly\nhalted when one guest, Duncan McFee is shot dead. Left with a dead lecturer in her room, Dotty begins to lose her grip, whilst\nGeorge, quite unaware that anything is amiss, is unable to offer\nany help or understanding. Her only succ our is Archie, Vice\nPresident of the University, who neatly disposes of the body and\nside-steps the ensuing police investigation.\nIt is difficult to pin down what makes this play so successful.\nAs an established play perhaps it is ideally suited to the West\nEnd, because so much of its meaning is contained in the text,\nrequiring little expressive acting from its cast. This is\nunfortunately true of Paul Eddington, whose long\nphilosophical monologues lose much meaning in their delivery.\nFelicity Kendal is both passionate and provocative, and is quite\naccustomed to Stoppard's work, having worked with Peter\nWood (director) both on this and his play, The Real Thing. Most\nspectacular of all, however are the professors of philosophy, the\njumpers, whose spectacular acrobatics conclude this farce in\nexcellent cabaret. An excellent play. Why can't the West End be\nlike this all the time?\nJAZZ\nShcpp\nI arrived late. Obviously. It\nwas only eight o 'clock but\nalready it was standing room\nonly. A man in a pork-pie hat\nand pinstripe suit was making\njokes onstage to an\nappreciative audience. 'Turn\nup the microphone, I feel like\nMick Jagger. I look a bit like\nhim, don'tI?' This was Archie\nShepp, a man in his fifties, but\nstill in excellent shape, drinking shorts and singing\nblues to a roaring audience. It\nwas a side of Sfjepp that I had\nnever seen be fo 're. It is easy to\ndispel those early l.p.'s( The\nMagic Of Ju-Ju and Four For\nTrane) as art for arts sake,\njumpin g on the already\nunsteady bandwagon o1 the\ntimes\u2014but here was living\nproof that a goodman matures with age. Playing a lot\nof mainstream themes( Charlie Parker early Coltrane\nand Eubie Blake ballads),\nShepp quite often changes\ntempo, (as in The Girl From\nIpanema; Latin-American to\n4:4 time), laying down riffs,\nsometime diffidently, often at\na breakneck pace. He was\nobviously dissatisfied with the\namplification in the house.\nAfter a furious turn, and\namidst cheers and applause,\nhe reached down and fished\nout a large microphone concealed deep inside his\nsaxophone.\nIf his jazz has become more\npalatable, it is no less\nmeaningful than that work of a decade ago, but it is more\ndirect. Shepp's jazz-poetry,\nspoken and sung over a loose\nrhythmic backing( by drummer Charlie Chan Jr)\nconveys the message that\nonce his horn would have\ntaken up. Poetry is nothing\nnew to jazz, but British\naudiences have heard little in\nrecent years. Now, the return\nof Jalal of The Last Poets ,\n( appearing on the new\nWorking Week I.p.). hopes to\nbring this expressive form\nback. Shepp himself is still\ntouring Britain, (he plays at\nThe Forum, Kentish Town on\nMay 16). To miss him this\ntime, is to miss one of the most\nversatile men in jazz at the\nmoment.\nCINEMA\nBirdy\nDid you ever see One Flew\nOver the Cuckoo's Nest? Well\nthe new film Birdy is the same\nsort of formula; a lunatic, you\nthink, and there's some Vietnam war thrown in there\ntoo somehow. None the less a good film with some very\nfunny sequences and a well\nacted and portrayed friendship between Birdy and his\nboyhood chum AI, played by\nMatthew Modine and Nicolas\nCage. Lighting and music\ngives a similar atmosphere to\nmany of Alan Parker's previous films.\nYes, the man who brought\nyou Midnight Express and\nThe Wall, Alan Parker sat in\nfront of me for the interview.\nSeeing his grey hair and big\nheaded smile left you wondering how this could\nrealy be the man who ruined\nthe Turkish tourist trade. The\ninterview is short and he has\nlittle to say.\nHe is keen to talk about the\nnew film and the new flying\ncameras used for the first\ntime, with little success. He\ncrashed most of them. He says\nhe likes the commercial aspect of the film\u2014American\nmoney\u2014as it helps him to get\nhis film, and what he has to\nsay, to the largest audience.\nFrankly he has said very little\nin the film, what there is is\nmainly the author's work,\nWilliam Wharton.\nHe mentions quickly, with\nnost alga, how he started his\ncareer walking up and down\nWardour Street with film\nscripts under his arms. That\nwas twenty years ago. Since\nthen he has shot commercials\nand was responsible for the\nfilm Fame.\nDespite him and the annoying background knowledge I enjoyed the film.\nThe book, I think, explains the\nschizophrenia which is left to\nthe imagination in the film.\nYou simply have to remember\nthat he really wants to make\nlove to the birds, rather than\nany high-school girl.\nSINGLES\nToyah: Don't Fall In Love\nNow recording for CBS, this\nnew single was meant to\nherald a new start for Toyah.\nUnfortunately, despite the\nhype that has bought it a chart\nplace, the music and lyrics are\nequally uninspiring. Boring.\nPhilip Bailey: Walking On The\nChinese Wall\nTitle track from his album,\nthis suffers from the same Phil\nColins percussion production\nand repetitive melodies as the\nother tracks. Easy Lover was a brilliant single (even if I, like\nmost others, am now bored to\ndeath with it) but this doesn't come close to it.\nClaire Hamill: If You'd Only\nTalk To Me\nNow support in tg Rick Wakeman on tour, Claire has\nhad more experience of the\ntrue soul scene (instead of the\nplastic disco imitations) than\nmost others. Despite the\nLindisfarne voice, and Stuart\nColeman (Of Shaky fame)\nproduction, a marvellously\nlilting tune.\nBangles: Going To Liverpool\nThe all new, all female,\nlatest Bananarama imitators\nhave yet another all new, all\nfemale, Banarama imitation\n\u2014and a pretty poor one at\nthat. Gerry and The Pacemakers meets Abba on vinyl.\nSugar Sugar: Bouncing Up\nThe thing I most dislike\nabout this single is that it's not\na full seven inches wide and so\nit f \u2014ks up my stylus. Mind you\nthe music doesn't do much to\nease that initial antipathy.\nWhy is pop music so bland\nthese days.?\nFEUX Friday 10 May 1985 11\n\n"

The sub vent ion paid to the\nUnion next year will be about \u00a328,000 less\nthan what has been claimed.\nBut the problem is completely artificial.\nAll that has happened is that a ridiculously\nlarge claim has been reduced to a reasonable\nlevel. It was optimistic for the Union to\nexpect a massive percentage increase in\nfunding based on virtually no increase in\nactivities.\nBut unfortunately the more outrageous\nclaims were not cut when they should have\nbeen; as soon as they were presented.\nNow that clubs have had their claims\naccepted by major sub-committee, DP and\nUFC, it will come as rather a bitter blow to\nfind that they are to be cut, after all. It makes\nforward planning impossible.\nThe Exec knew exactly what sort of\nsub vent ion the Union would get next year. It\nis somewhat to their shame that they didn't use that information when the first round of\nclaims were being considered. To have left it\nthis late was folly, indeed.\nWhere should the money come from?\nEvery year the Union spends many\nthousands of pounds paying for students to\nhave foreign holidays. This comes under the\neuphemistic heading of'tour grants' for clubs\nand societies. This expenditure cannot be\njustified (except for certain competitive\nsports). The Union should provide\nequipment and training for clubs\u2014it should\nnot pay for students to travel abroad when\nthey can just as easily do the same thing at\nhome. This is a gross misuse of Crown funds.\nAnother good area for saving is C CU beer\nmoney. One of the CCUs spends \u00a33000 per\nyear on beer which is given away to is\nmembers.\nAs long as these activities continue there is\nno financial crisis in the Union. There is fat to\nbe lost, and if it is lost properly, it will make\nthe Union a more efficient organisation,\ngiving value for money.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Debbie,\nJohn, Jon, Grenville, Ajay, Chris, Pete,\nRichard, Patrick, Christopher, Alan, Hugh,\nLuke, Tinker, Steve, Nigel, Rosemary, Tony\nand all the colla tors.

    "content": "Armchair\nPerverts\nApparently, it is a fact that\nthe average male thinks about\nthe act of sexual intercourse,\nor a related subject, at least\nonce every fifteen minutes, if\nnot more frequently; the\nauthor of this essay would\ncertainly vouch for this piece\nof information and even DH Lawrence comments on man's affliction in Lady Chatterly's Lover, when the\nman who was knocking her off\nbefore Mellors, expresses his\nresentment of the absurd and\ndegrading charade that is\ninflicted upon himself by his\ninstincts. Moreover, I would\npoint out that the frequency is\nseasonally dependant too, the\nsummer period seeing a marked increase in this\nparameter (comparable only\nto the effect obtained by\nstuffing one's self with\noysters) principally because\nof the weather bringing o:;\": mini-skirts, hot-pants and t f. like.\nIt is also at this time of th\nyear that one is presented wit\nthe matter of examinations\nwhich are consequently difficult to work for, owning tc\nreasons concerning the above, or, more precisely, it is\na case of:\n'Please help me Mr Student\nCounseller, or whatever your\nname is, you can give me\nadvise that concerns coping\nwith examination stress,\ndepression and all of that but\nthis does not resolve the\nsexual frustration that I am\nexperiencing and which is\ndissolving my concentration: I mean, one minute I am\npondering Maxwell's equation\nand the next, my attention is\ndiverted to some creature who\nhas just walked past or\ncrossed her legs. The situation is desperate, I will\nnot fail my examinations\nbecause I lack intelligence but\nbecause I 've spent all my time\nin the library bog abusing\nmyself.'\nTherefore, may I recommend the Festival of Erotica at\nthe Raymond Revue Bar, to\nthose who feel these same\ntendencies that have just been\ndefined. For \u00a310 (there are no\nstudent discounts, so don't bother asking) one experiences one hour and twenty\nminutes of, as the advertisements describe it, Erotic\nEntertainment which is\nbroken up into about fourteen\nacts; the adverts also mention\nfull air-conditioning, I wonder\nwhy? The performances start\nat 7.00, 9.00 and 11.00pm but\nwhether they become chronologically seedier, I don't know.\nIt is genuine 'executive cl if material, or more explicitly it\nis tasteful, soft pornography.\nThe performers are exceptionally pretty and there are no\nsordid details such as nicotine-stained nipples, nor\nare there any flabby girls at\nwhom one has to take a second glance in order to\ndetermine which crease is the\none of interest. There are also\nno rip-offs, such as hostesses\nwho politely insist that you\npurchase an exorbitantly\nexpensive bottle of diluted\nChampagne or face a skirmish with the bouncers; in fact it\nwas a compromise between\nthe two: an effeminate wimp\nwho realised that he could\nnever achieve either, contented himself by directing people to their seats.\nIt was noticeable that\namongst the audience, there\nwas a high proportion of\norientals, which perhaps\nreinforces the earlier point\nthat controlling one's sexual\nurges is related to efficiency at\nworking: that is, these people,\nwho are re known ed for their\nmental stamina, release their\ntensions in one short burst (or\nseveral rapid and successive\nones, to be pendant ic). There is actually quite an art\nto coming in one's pants,\nsince there is the initial\nproblem of overcoming the\nludicrously of the blatant\nphallic symbolism employed\nin the show to be able to\narouse oneself; also the seats\nare so confined that there is\nnot enough room to administer even a discreet tickle. One guesses from the liberal usage\nof the sledgehammer metaphor es, such as strip-tea ze on motorbikes that\nrepresent throbbing machinery pounding in between the\ngirls legs, that the designer\nand choreographer are pundits of Desmond Morris.\nThe most unsubtle act was\nthe 'love-bomb', which is a scene depicting a beautiful\ngirl writhing ry th mic ally backwards and forwards on\ntop of a huge SS-20 shaped\nobject, whose front end glowed red when caressed by\nthe aforementioned girl and,\nwhen a lever is thrown,\nabruptly and un smoothly adopts a new angle of\nelevation which almost causes the girl to be thrown\noff her mount.\nRather surprisingly there\nwere no acts that incorporated nurses or schoolgirls; fair\nenough, so these ideas have\nyellowed, however I would\nsuggest that these ideas\nought to be used in the\nintroduction to provide a concept that the punters can\nrelate to before progressing to\nmore complicated ideas. A spread eagle d girl in the\nmiddle of a large cream cake\nwas too great a step in the\nrealms of sexual fantasy and a gradual approach should have been adopted which\nwould have made the show\nmore pla usable and thus\nfacilitated arousal.\nReturning to the topic of\n'coming in one's pants' and\nhaving assumed that one now\nhas an erection, the moment\nat which one leaves the\nauditorium and rushes to the\nlavatory, something that for\nsome occurred frequently,\nhas to be chosen. One can\nalways tell the amateur by the\nway he runs out, almost\ndoubled up, hands on groin\nand grunting, whereas the\nperson of greater experience\nstrolls leisurely across the\nfront of the stage towards the\ndoor at the same time that a performer, whom he casually\nobserves on passing, is\nprostrate in front of him.\nIn one of Anna Ford's recently published articles in\nthe Sunday Telegraph that\npromoted her new book about\nmen, she claimed that women\nhad the converse reaction to\nthe male's serious hand in\npocket approach. From my\nexperience, I must disagree:\nthe attitude is certainly\ndifferent from that of the\nman's which I believe that\nshow has correctly described,\nhowever, I found the females's jocular approach non existent and a bored one in its\nplace; perhaps this is not\nsurprising in the light of her\ndubious claim that 60% of\nmales have external marital\naffairs. It was almost as if their\nhusbands had forced them\nalong, expecting them to\nmemorize the varo us acts so\nas they can be re-enacted at\nhome; although it is uncertain\nwhether swinging from a ceiling light without disturbing the neighbours or causing\nmultiple back injuries is\nfeasible.\nFor those without wives, the\nprogram proudly advertises\nthe video in order that one\nmay relieve the evening in the\ncomfort of one's own home;\nthis is euphemistically a way\nof saying that you can sit in\nfront of the television masturbating which would be\nimpossible to do at the show\nwithout being arrested for\ngross indecency in a pubic\nplace.\nIn retrospect, the females'\nennui was not unexpected\nsince there was only one male\nperformer whose G String\nremained on throught out, although he did swing about\non a rope, thrusting his pelvis\ninto the audience, which I guess is moderately stimulating for those interested in this\nsort of thing. Perhaps this\npreservation of humility is a result of the laws regulating\npornography: it is permissible\nto show explicit y scenes of\ncunnilingus however, it is not\nto show an erect penis;\npornographic videos will\nsometimes feature love sessions which show a woman 'jacking off a man\nwith a limp one, which I guess\nsuggest that either the actor\nhas remarkable self-control or\nthat he has masturbated\nseveral times before hand to\nobtain this effect. The latter is\nmore plausible as this would\nexplain why, to a large extent,\nblacks are employed for this:\nnot because of the belief that\nthe negroid member is\nsuperior to the whiteman'scouter part but because the\nbruising of the genitals is less\nobvious.\nThe final scene involved all\nthe female performers in a naked state (but of course)\nand square-bashing. I admit\nthat this was my favourite act\nbecause it was the most\ntasteful, least pretentious and\ndemonstrated the beauty of\nthe female form.\n'Bullshit, you're just a pervert', you, the reader,\nreply.\n10 Friday 10 May 1985 FEUX\n\n"

This recalls the\ncherished memory of a disgruntled American tourist\nwho arrived one weekday to be\nconfronted with the sight of\nstall after stall of perishables\nbut there again, what does one\nexpect from these overtly dense\nTrans-Atlantic types, other\nthan their usual obnoxious\nhabits, such as their pseudo\nlaughter that has as much\nfeeling as a faked orgasm and\ntheir insipid nature, which was\nepi tomis ed by one who\ndeclared to his wife on their\ndeparture from the Stratford\nTheatre ten minutes after the\nplay had begun,\n'Well Millie, ya can now truly\nsay that ya've seen Shakespeare.'\nHowever, before this article\ndeclines into descriptions of\nAmericans and vegetables, which\nare actually quite difficult to\ndifferentiate between, I will\ndescribe the features of\nPortobello that students tend to\nhave a greater affinity towards.\nThe stall holders' bawdy and\nabrasive proclamation of today's prices and 'specials' contrast with\nthe tactful approaches to passers\nby made by the furtive characters\nwho stand on street corners and\nwho offer various illicit substances at separation of an\ninch between noses.\nFrom here say, 'dope' may also\nbe obtained from the pub, which\nis located on the corner of\nLadbroke Grove and Blenheim\nCrescent a side-street off of\nPortobello; associates have been\npropositioned six times within an\nhour in this pub. Apart from its\nreputation for live music, it is\nalso rumoured to be under\ncontinual surveillance by the\npolice who frequently subject\npersons leaving the premises,\nwho they suspect of carrying\ndrugs, to a body search; , I therefore advise that readers,\nwho are unfortunate enough to\nhave a squint, to study their\ncopies of But Were Afraid To\nAsk before wandering around\nthis neighbourhood.\nFrom the backstreet s, from the gutter\nPortobello Road \u2014 fruit, ve g, antiques, dope and\nRough Trade Records. Our roving reporter, Christoper\nMurray investigates...\nOf all the publications that\ndeluged me during Freshers's week, this was the outstanding\none. It is, in effect, a compendium of party con versa tion, including such topics as the\nrelative viscosity of cervical\nmucus and the insertion of\npebbles into the female genitalia\nof camels( presumably explaining their notoriety for\nbeing bad tempered) by Arabs\nwhich constituted the first\nexample of the principle of IUD( and I guess, that of the french\ntickle r too). I can well remember\nan argument, concerning the\norientation of the rectum, that\nwas only resolved when B WAT A was brought out from underneath the bed and a Another public house in the\narea and that can be\nrecommended is the Colville\nsited half way along Portobello\nRoad, it boasts, on the\nadvertisements outside, of\nSunday afternoon strip shows in\nits upstairs function room that\nstar stripping vicars and the like.\nHowever, it is suggested to the\nreal ale buffs that they try the\nEarl of Lonsdale on Westbourne\nGrove, which is near to the\nNotting Hill end of Portobello\nRoad and is one of the twelve\nSam Smiths outlets in London;\nThe Museum ale is re-commended.\nThe shops on Portobello Road\nare also of interest and often\nprovide a respite from the busy\nmarket.\nNotices displayed in Newagents' windows are always\nworthwhile to glance at, since\nusually among the second-hand\nbicycle market and flats to let,\nthere are a few dubious ones that\nadvertise caring and understanding relationships with\n'Sensuous Cindy' and friends, or\ndetailed\ninspection\nof the male and\nfemale genitalia\nmade One questions\nthe rationale of such\na publication, perhaps\nit is to prevent wide spread\nphysical abuse of one's perso\nhowever, if this is the case,\nperi en ce shows that this principle\nis comparable to making\nschoolboys undertake physical\neducation to reduce masturbation: According to Desmond\nMorris, the People's psycho lo gist, in the Naked Ape, it is self-defeating since the extra energy\nacquired by increased fitness\nmust still be expended in sofie\nway, similarly, B WAT A increases the inquisitiveness of its\nreader and results in greater\nexperimentation.\nmore euphemistically, 'Acting\nlessons administered by an\nexperienced actress, with a large\nrange of uniforms to choose\nfrom' or 'Tutoring available,\ndiscipline and firmness guaranteed'.\nSituated just off of Portobello,\nalong Talbot Road and opposite\none of those underground\nlavatories, there is the Rough\nTrade Record Shop; it deals\nexclusively in records that are\nreleased on independent labels\nand consequently a vast\nproportion of the stock has been\nrecorded by groups with\nprofound and radical names such\nas 'Fellatio in Smegma'. Also, for\nthose who consider buying socalled 'commercial' music as\nbeing materialistic and thus\ntantamount to supporting\ncapitalism and the music press of\nbeing b latent ly exploited by the\nlarge record concerns, this shop\nalso stocks a large supply of\nFanzines that will nurture your\nthoughts still further. Invariably\nthey consist of dreadful interviews with the local bands,\nthat not only fail to demonstrate\nany attempt at criticism but\nprovide the groups with the\nopportunity of self-adulation,\nand to spout out their\ncontradictory politics. Also they\ninclude self-opinionated verbose\narticles by the editor, who revels\nin puerile resentment and a wit,\nthat fails to compare with second\nrate, pre-sixth form humour.\nThe Basement shop is located\nunderneath Rough Trade and is\nthought to be an extension of the\nunderground conveniences; it\nsupplies the peripherals that any\nself-respecting alternative person\nmight require, for example,\nearrings made from IUDs.\nLikewise, the other clothes shops\non Portobello tend to provide for\nthe Kensington Market Set,\nexamples of which being the\nLeather Rat and the Cage.\nThose who wish to maintain\nthe students' reputation for being\nobnoxious might like to try\ndriving a car down the road on a busy market day, say Saturday,\nwith liberal usage of the horn.\nThose without a car, who still\nwish to be obnoxious in some\nother way, will find that\nLadbroke Grove is the closest\ntube station, although Notting\nHill Gate is also in close\nproximity. Sightseers are warned\nagainst the abundance of\ndefecation left by dogs.\n*Didyou know... that Portobello is\na small port in Panama, on the\nCarribean northeast of Colon.\nFEUX Friday 10 r \u00abay 198S "

During lunch the rest of\nthe team arrived and afterwards\ntook us to 147 all out. Surrey\nwere 18 for 2 then 39 for 3.

The PGs fought\nback some extent Robin\nGraham taking three wickets in\nhis short spell of spin bowling.\nEventually, the UGs declared\nat 214 for 8, and both teams, with\nspectators, proceeded to devour\nthe teas they had carted along.\nThe PGs started soundly but\nwere seen under pressure from\nthe fast opening attack of Dave\nShipley and Phil Rawstron. One\nover by the captain led to a very\nclose run out, followed by the\nwild (if not wide) antics of a certain AT Belk. Mike Jordan\nthen proved himself a very able\nbowler with figures of two for two\nresulting in the final defeat of the\nPGs on 78 all out.\nMany thanks to everyone who\nturned up\u2014I hope they enjoyed\nthemselves, and thanks\nespecially to Dave and Robin for\ntheir captaincies.\nPs We challenge the Maths\nUGs\u2014Just name a date Roy!\nSunday XI\nAnyone, yes ANYONE, who\nwants a game of cricket, on\nSundays May 19 and/or June 2,\n16 or July 14, and 28 then the\nSunday XI is for you.

The rule is\nquite simple: no cars are allowed to park\nwithout a permit, that is without a temporary\nor permanent parking permit.\nAlso, on the exits at Exhibition Road and\nImperial College Road, motorcyclists are\nrequested to drive to the left of the barrier\n(there is a sign!) otherwise the crash barrier\nwill not work properly. One motorcyclist\nnearly received injuries through not doing\nthis.\nYours faithfully,\nTraffic wardens\nThe last\nDear Sir,\nLast week Mr Aharoni said that the Israelis\n'tried not to hurt civilians'. I was in Lebanon\nduring the invasion and I myself saw that the\nplanes attacked the shelters rather than the\nmilitary installations.\nI can't help comparing Hitler exerting the\nright of Germany to self-defence and to live\nwithin secure and easily defensible\nboundaries by occupying France, and Israel's occupation of most of Lebanon.\nI would just like to add that I consider\nevery inch of my land very dear to my heart.\nYours sincerely,\nT Shaker\nDear Sir,\nFar be it from me to bore anyone any more\nabout the continuing saga of the infamous\nslogan 'Down with Israel', but we feel it to be\nour duty to clear up some anomalies and\nmisunderstandings.\nWe think it is about time that all those\nconcerned in the Middle Eastern conflict sit\ntogether in an attempt to reach a peaceful and\njust solution, what we do not agree to is the\nmethod adopted by the Israelis towards that\njust and rightful settlement. Furthermore,\nIsrael's iron fist policy that was clearly visible\nin the Lebanon goes on to show their lack of\nwillingness towards that long-spoken-of\n'peaceful settlement'.\nThirty seven years have gone by and we are\nstill trying to overcome the roots of the whole\nproblem namely, the clash between\nPalestinian nationalism and Zionist\nideology.\nFinally, it is important to emphasise that as\nlong as the Palestinian rights to self-determination and the establishment of their\nown independent states are ignored, there\nwill never be a lasting and durable peace in\nthe whole region. Israel can not simply\nenforce their own peace settlement and call it\na just solution.\nYours faithfully,\nFriends of Palestine Cttee\nword...\nDear Sir,\nIt is the 'realistic attitude' adopted by people\nsuch as T Sheriff and T Ishaq which leads to\ncountless people being killed daily in the\nMiddle East. How do they dare call the civil\nwar that has raged in Lebanon before, during\nand now, after Israel's campaign, freedom?\nIsrael has often tried to extend a peaceful\nhand to its neighbours: when one responds,\nas President Sadat of Egypt did, you know\nonly too well how his own brethren rewarded\nhim. No wonder the open hand of friendship\nclenches into a firm fist.\nIs it not more realistic to face up to\nproblems, like Israel does, and admit that one\ncan make mistakes and then hold an inquest\ninto what went wrong, rather than just say 'it\nis Israel's fault'? Blaming everything on us\nJews is perhaps the only comparison to the\nSecond World War.\nTo compare the Jewish victims of WW2,\nwho were innocent scapegoats of the\nGermans, to the Arab victims of today, who\nthemselves proclaimed the Jihad against\nIsrael, is totally ludicrous. As such, I feel that\nus Jews have learnt very well from our past.\nNever again will we stand by defenceless\nwhile another nation tries to take away our\nright to live, but will take up arms to defend\nourselves against anyone threatening to do\nso.\nYours faithfully,\nMichael van Messel\nPhysics 1\nThe editor will accept no more\nletters on the subject of the conflict\nbetween Israel and the Lebanon.\nThe correspondence on the subject\nof the slogan 'Down with Israel' is\nclosed.\nPARODY\nShMv<f/v_ j/Y/ l6c is4 Friday 10 May 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "The general robot lab, Imperial College\nas By the early eighties robotics work was well established at Imperial College,\nwith several teams working in a number of different departments. However, as\na wide range of technical expertise are used for the development and\nunderstanding of robots and automated systems, a focal point was needed to\nco-ordinate the existing activities and to stimulate new interdepartmental\nresearch and teaching. So in 1981 the Centre for Robotics and Automated\nSystems (CROBAS) was set up with Professor Tom Husband as Director. The\nCentre has admin strat ive offices and a main robotics laboratory in the\nMechanical Engineering Department, but also has access to many facilities\nthroughout College. The work of the Centre covers the managerial, social, and\neconomic issues involved with automation, as well as the technological\naspects. So the Departments of Social and Economic Studies, and\nManagement Science, play an important role in the activities of the Centre\nalong with Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computing.\nThere are also a number of other groups throughout College, such as\nAstronomy and Metallurgy whose work is linked with the Centre.\nIn all its activities the Centre aims to meet the needs of industry as well as\nthe academic community. The main way this is achieved is through the joint\nacademic/industrial Steering Committee. The committee consists of academic\nstaff and representatives from industry, and meets twice a year to discuss the\ndirection that teaching and research should take.\nBritish industry has an urgent need for well-qualified graduates with a good\nunderstanding of the potential of automated systems. To add to this many\npeople in mid-career find that they need educating about the new\ntechnologies. So the Centre runs an MSc course in Industrial Robotics and\nManufacturing Automation, and is keen to take on graduates with a few years'\nindustrial experience, as well as fresh graduates. Along with this short courses\nof two to four days are run, giving practising engineers and managers an\nintroduction to robotics and related activities, with the opportunity to see\nrobots in action.\nThe Centre is also a robotics consultant approved by the Department of\nTrade and Industry. In this capacity it can carry out specific studies to try and\nsolve problems and make systems more efficient, or it can give advice on the\nintroduction of automation into a factory.\nIT COULD BE said that we are\nin the midst of a robotics\nrevolution, which has the\npotential to touch all of our lives.\nThe speed of technological\nadvancement over the last few\nyears has been spectacular with\nmany industrial processes now\nbeing largely automated. It\nseems likely that fully automated\nand unmanned factories may be\nwith us in only a few decades.\nIn the sixties industrial robots\nwere first introduced, carrying\nout such tasks as spray painting\nand spot welding. These first\ngeneration robots are limited in\ntheir potential application\nbecause although they can be\nprogrammed to carry out a given\ntask, they are unable to react to\nchanging conditions. Now second\ngeneration robots are being\ndeveloped that receive sensory\ninformation, typically visual and\ntactile, from their environment,\nand so have a limited capability\nto adapt to changing conditions.\nThe next stage on from these will\nbe the third generation robots\nthat will receive every type of\nsensory input and will have\n'artificial intelligence' that will be\nused to solve problems. There\nwill be a vast range of potential\napplications for these robots\nincluding assembly, inspection\nand many other activities which\nhave long been associated with\nhuman skills of manual and\nmental dexterity. There will also\nbe many non-industrial uses such\nas security work, space\nexploration, farming, helping the\ndisabled, and many more.\nResearch activities at the\nCentre cover many aspects of\nautomated systems including\nrobotics. The work is mainly\ncarried out in the departments,\nwith a substantial amount of the\nwork being interdepartmental.\nOver fifty per cent of the funding\nfor research is coming from\nindustry, with there being a number of 'teaching company'\nprojects where students are\nsupervised jointly by College staff\nand companies such as Lucas,\nPhilips, and Rolls Royce. As a result of one such project with\nLucas, a vision system has been\ndeveloped to be used in a flexible\nassembly systems. It allows\nheadlamps on an input conveyor\nto be individually identified so\nthat the robot can them perform\nappropriate operations on them.\nThe development of vision\nsystems opens up a wide range of\napplications, and some of the\n8\nThe Omnigripper\ncurrent research is aimed at\nproducing more advanced vision\nsystems. Other current research\nprojects are looking at areas like,\nrobotic assembly, safety and\nreliability, laser machining, use of\nrobots in hazardous\nenvironments, use of robots in\nthe meat processing industry, and\nmany others.\nRobotic Assembly has been\nsingled out as one of the most\nimportant applications for second\ngeneration robots, and it is\npredicted that it will become a major robot application within a decade. The underlying principles\nthat govern robotics assembly are\nbeing studied by a team from\nMechanical Engineering. The\nmajor interests are cost\neffectiveness and the ability of\nsystems to react to changes in\nproducts and processes. A major\ndevelopment to come from this\nwork is a form of 'Universal\nGripper'. At present the gripper s used in assembly work can only\nhandle a few shapes and so have\nlimited adaptability to any change\nin the process, with both time\nand money being lost when a gripper has to be changed. The\nnew 'Omnigripper' shown is a largely universal gripper and may\nhelp to solve this problem. It\nconsists of two parallel slightly\nseparate 'fingers' each consisting\nof an array of eight by sixteen\nclosely spaced pins, which can\nride vertically up and down\nindependently of one another. As\nthe gripper is lowered over an\nobject, some pins will be pushed\nout of the way, so creating\n'customised' fingers which mould\nto fit the part. For grasping\nobjects either the two fingers can\nbe brought together to grip the\nobject externally, or else they can\nbe moved slightly apart for an\ninternal grip. There is feed back\nfrom each pin of the\nOmnigripper, providing tactile\ninformation about the object,\nincluding height details. So there\nis the potential for recognition of\nobjects.\nIn the meat processing industry\nde-boning is a major task. The\nwork is very monotonous, but\nrequires great concentration, and\nhand and eye co-ordination, and\nis at present carried out by\nskilled butchers. A team from the\nDepartments of Electrical and\nMechanical Engineering are\ncollaborating with a meat\nprocessing company to develop a prototype robot system for de-boning bacon backs prior to\nslicing and packaging. The\nsystem is required to extract up\nto fifteen ribs and some other\nbones from the cured bacon.\nWork on this systems is near to\ncompletion, and the robot system\nis shown in the photograph. First\nthe bone layout is registered by\nplunging needles into the bacon,\nthese penetrate the meat but not\nthe bone, and send back tactile\ninformation. Then a special tool\ncuts round each bone tip, and a moving loop placed over the\nbone tip pulls back and strips the\nbone cleanly from the meat.\nOne of the most attractive\npotential uses for robots is in the\nassistance of disabled people with\ntasks like eating and page\nturning. This possibility is\ncurrently being studied and it is\nhoped that in the future further\nnon-industrial uses, including the\ndevelop met of artificial limbs, can\nbe studied.\nLasers provide one of the most\neasily automated forms of ene rc available to industry, and as a consequence they are being use e to cut and process metal. The\nuse of robot mounted lasers for\nthese processes is being studied\nby a team from Metallury and\nMaterials Science.\nSafety and reliability of robots\nin the working environment is of\nthe utmost importance, and\nforms the basis for a major\nresearch project at the Centre.\nThis project is being carried out\nin collaboration with the National\nCentre for Systems Reliability\nand the Health and Safety\nExecutive. Part of the work is\ncovering the impact that the\nintroduction of robots has upon\nhealth and safety in the working\nenvironment. Although robots\ncan be fenced off there will still\nbe occassions when humans\ncome into close proximity with\nthem, and this presents a potential safety hazard. For\ninstance at pick-up points or\nwhere the robots maximum reach\noverlaps perimeter fencing, it is\npossible that someone could be\ntrapped or crushed. The team\nfrom Management Science and\nMechanical Engineering are\nlooking at the effect of robot\ndesign on electronic and\nmechanical malfunction. Using\ninformation about the failure rate\nof individual components that\nmake up the robot systems, it is\npossible to quantify the overall\nreliability of the robot and a typical cell in which it is used.\nThe work at the Centre shows\nclearly how academics and\nindustrialists can work together\nto satisfy both their needs.\nAlthough at present the\ncapabilities of robots are still very\nlimited, in the future they have a vast potential.\nBacon de-boning - by robot\n10 May 1985 9\n\n"

This gives\nan answer of 40'.\nThe answer to the grade five puzzle was found in a similar\nway, but by considering the three different routes that are\npossible, the dimensions of the room were given as 260,240 and\n-190.\nThe two sentences were:-'The number of occur en ces of the number 1 is 3, of 2 is 2, of 3\nis 3, of 4 is 1, and of 5 is 1'.\n'The number of occur en ces of the number 0 is 1, of 1 is 4, of 2\nis 3, of 4 is 2, of 5 is 1, and of 6 is 1.'\nThe geometrical puzzle could be solved as shown.\nThe missing angle must, by similar triangles, be B. Thus A+B=C. Since there was only one correct entry per puzzle, no solution\nwas left un rewarded. Correct answers to all the puzzles, except the grade five one,\nfrom S Errington Min Tech PG who wins himself \u00a315.\nThe grade five puzzle was won by YUJI MATSUMOTO from\nComputing, who may collect his \u00a35 cheque after Wednesday.\nKm\\N\\< To M(iH K/ Kib\n. ^^^^^^y^^^^ horizontal optically core ct base.\n^kr SUlllli//^ ^ ^ ^ ^ After being filled with water it\nThe story goes like this:\nWhen you pull the plug out after a bath you'll have noticed the water\nswirls round. If you are in the\nnorthern hemisphere it swirls one\nway, if in the southern hemisphere\nit goes another, if on the equator it\ngoes straight down. This is because\nof the earth's rotation.\nSparing no expense FELIX sent two of Imperial's top\nscientific brains to do a carefully\ncontrolled experiment in the Beit\nHall washrooms. A bath was\nfilled with water, the plug pull led and the water went clockwise.\nAnother bath was filled with\nwater, the plug pulled and Voila!\nit went anti-clockwise.\nDr Bignell of the Atmospheric\nPhysics Department explained\nwhy our carefully controlled\nexperiment went wrong. For the\nearth's spin to have any effect the\nbath would need to be 10m in\ndiameter, with a perfectly\nhorizontal optically core ct base.\nAfter being filled with water it\nwould need to be left in the dark\n(to prevent radiation heating) for\nthree days. The plug would need\nto be carefully drawn down the\ndrain hole and out, to prevent\nany eddy currents developing.\nApparently someone actually has\ncarried a bath like this round the\nworld and the effect can be seen.\nBut a 'normal' bath?\nNo way.\nFEUX Friday 10 May 1985\n\n"
